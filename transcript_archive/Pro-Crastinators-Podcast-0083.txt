00:00:00 You just don't get it. I could serve Earth from some alien attack I could pretend my life had meaning.
00:00:06 Meaningless objects can't give meaning or purpose to other meaningless objects.
00:00:12 Meaning and purpose. Ha ha. It would only be in your head, just like a god. It doesn't exist.
00:00:20 There is no free will love purpose meaning or reason to live.
00:00:25 I guess when I think about it, you're right. Love is just a result of hormones in our brains
00:00:31 and all other actions are determined by our brain. I guess everything is meaningless.
00:00:37 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best guy ever
00:00:45 leader of a tribe called Quest. Welcome to the podcast with Digibro.
00:00:51 Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
00:01:21 in Hippocrite. In Hippocrite.
00:01:23 Uh, I, you know, I have a Patreon, but it just doesn't matter.
00:01:27 But it would be nice if it would be nice if some coins fell in.
00:01:31 You know, it's pointless overall. We're all gonna die in the universe.
00:01:35 But you know, patreon.com slash my wrist.
00:01:39 That's the one. That's the one.
00:01:41 Pledge me one measly bitcoin per month on Patreon.
00:01:44 A bitcoin is worth like $67 or something.
00:01:46 Dude, I thought it was worth like hundreds.
00:01:48 I don't know if it's a bitcoin. You can only buy a car or maybe a HIV positive blood vessel.
00:01:54 Oh, this, I like where this meme is going. HIV.
00:01:58 Oh, what a good meme. I like HIV.
00:02:00 He never heard that one before.
00:02:02 Let's get right down to it. We're talking about how nihilism.
00:02:06 Nothing matters. Nothing matters.
00:02:08 I'm just gonna go, I'm just gonna go right out on record and say that it's true.
00:02:12 And there's no room for argument on this topic.
00:02:16 No, babe. I don't know what nihilism is. Nate, is there any way you have me know what nihilism is?
00:02:23 I didn't prepare this podcast at all. Please.
00:02:25 I'm rubbing my chakra nodes at such high speed together to elicit an answer from the cosmos.
00:02:31 And I'm getting something from UrbanDictionary.com slash go.
00:02:36 It's nihilism. Definition. It's useless to define it.
00:02:41 Oh, they got...
00:02:43 Oh, what a good one.
00:02:45 I'm pretty sure it has really gotten me.
00:02:48 I know. There's a really long one, but I'll just read like the beginning of it.
00:02:51 Okay, nihilism.
00:02:52 A philosophy based on extreme skepticism in its most basic form before it was clouded by...
00:02:58 Oh, God. Fuck this.
00:03:00 Yeah, that was going downhill.
00:03:03 It's a pretty high IQ to be a nihilist.
00:03:05 It says in parentheses, before it was clouded by ideas involving politics, social rhetoric, sex, drugs, rock and roll, etc.
00:03:12 Oh, my God.
00:03:14 Which we can refer to as epistemological nihilism.
00:03:18 Okay, that's fair because it's about the existence.
00:03:20 No, no, no. Well, that's bullshit because now he's defining nihilism as just one kind of nihilism.
00:03:24 What about the other kinds?
00:03:26 Well, okay. The next part is simply denies the possibility of knowledge of truth, which I think is relatively succinct.
00:03:33 The Catholic Church has really gone downhill ever since Pope Urban made his own dictionary.
00:03:39 It's true, it's true.
00:03:42 Hey, hey, before we get into any of the discussion, we should probably have like a blatant statement for like what each of us are.
00:03:48 Like, like, there's optimists, there's realists, there's pragmatists, there's dentists, there's abolitionists, there's Marxists,
00:03:53 or even the dreaded Beatlejuice, which is a spiritual anomaly trained in the dark arts of Spookradi and Guljitsu.
00:04:01 I'm a dentist in that I will put dents in your fucking skull, bitch.
00:04:06 Oh, shit, dude.
00:04:08 That's awesome.
00:04:10 That's sick.
00:04:12 Ben, what are you? How would you define yourself in this way?
00:04:14 I guess I'm a nihilist. I guess I'm a nihilist and I believe in nothing and I'm real cool.
00:04:18 Yeah, you can say I'm a nihilist.
00:04:20 I'm vaping and tilting my fedora and in my in my sick flame print Hawaiian shirt over here.
00:04:26 Fedora tipping for atheists. Us proud nihilists are more of the cluster punk variety.
00:04:31 We don't believe in fashion or anything for that matter.
00:04:35 Let me tell you how much of a nihilist I am.
00:04:37 I was torn. I was torn on, you know, you can be a religious guy and that sucks.
00:04:42 And you can be an atheist and that sucks, too.
00:04:45 Because, like, as spirit science teaches us, you don't pick just one.
00:04:48 You can't pick being an atheist or being religious.
00:04:50 Don't restrict yourself.
00:04:51 This is just boxes of belief and you're not supposed to be limited to one.
00:04:55 But then there's the middle ground.
00:04:57 There's the, like, oh, well, who fucking knows?
00:04:59 The being agnostic. But that wasn't good enough for me.
00:05:02 I needed to go one step further.
00:05:04 So I dug a little deep and I discovered something that's even more nihilistic than all three of those,
00:05:12 which is a theological non-cognitivist, which is what I am.
00:05:18 Hang on.
00:05:19 Okay, define that.
00:05:21 Well, okay, agnosticism says that we cannot know for sure whether there is a God or not.
00:05:28 Theological non-cognitivism is the statement that the question of whether or not God exists
00:05:33 is ill-formed and does not have any meaning.
00:05:36 The concept of God is ill-defined in language to the point that even asking the question
00:05:41 of whether he exists is not actually asking anything at all and therefore there is no question.
00:05:47 Well, I'm with you on there.
00:05:49 That's the level of nihilism you all are dealing with right here.
00:05:53 Yeah, I guess so.
00:05:54 I would just, like, it depends on what version of God you mean, I guess.
00:05:57 Like, some people believe it's like a literal entity.
00:05:59 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:06:00 This is saying about God?
00:06:02 Yeah, I know, I know.
00:06:03 You would have to rigorously define your terms in order to ask the question in the first place.
00:06:07 But the point is that it's not well-defined on a broad enough level.
00:06:10 Oh, boy, I'm reading the definition of nihilism on Wikipedia, getting so excited.
00:06:15 See, there's different types.
00:06:17 There's existential nihilism means that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.
00:06:23 True.
00:06:24 Obviously true.
00:06:25 Of course.
00:06:26 Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality and accepted moral values are abstractly contrived.
00:06:30 Even more obvious.
00:06:31 Definitely.
00:06:32 Even more obvious.
00:06:33 But this is my favorite.
00:06:34 Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning, respectively,
00:06:39 that in some aspect, knowledge is not possible or reality does not actually exist.
00:06:45 Hell yeah.
00:06:46 The first one is true.
00:06:47 Oh, that's the real, that's the core nihilism.
00:06:48 Also, the second one is not true.
00:06:50 Well, yeah, I'll be okay, we'll see.
00:06:53 Incidentally, I would define a lot of those just aren't easily applied.
00:06:57 Hey, everyone, I just solved the existence.
00:07:01 I just solved the riddle of existence right here for you.
00:07:03 I laid it all out.
00:07:04 There's the answer.
00:07:05 Because I just picked which nihilisms are true and which nihilisms are false.
00:07:08 And there's no room for debate.
00:07:10 Dude, my favorite thing about this is that the little box on the side on Wikipedia is
00:07:15 part of a series on certainty.
00:07:17 Something about seeing these incredibly large concepts, like just thrown around, you know,
00:07:25 I love it.
00:07:27 I'm a label nihilist and that I don't believe labels are important and I don't care to
00:07:32 know what they mean, so I will just make one up.
00:07:35 How will you tell your fluffernutter from your mayonnaise without these labels?
00:07:39 You're fucked.
00:07:40 I just look at them and then I see.
00:07:43 When you're a young restauranteer and you don't label your fucking food, you're going
00:07:47 to go belly up quick before that little brrrr Scottish boy comes in and he slaps you by
00:07:53 the ear.
00:07:54 Well here, when I was younger, I used to define myself as a hedonist and I still do to some
00:08:00 degree, which is a hedonist is just one who believes that the purpose of life is defined
00:08:08 by obtaining pleasure and positive affirmation in this world.
00:08:12 I still, to a large extent, think that's true because the only concrete system we have to
00:08:17 operate along is positive and negative feedback as perceived by our brain.
00:08:21 In a sense, I still sort of agree with that, but I would call myself sort of like a pragmatic
00:08:26 hedonist.
00:08:27 Jesus Christ.
00:08:28 Jesus Christ.
00:08:29 That's the funny thing about all these terms is that whether or not they contradict each
00:08:37 other is so vague because I would say the idea that there's no objective moral value.
00:08:44 That seems obvious, but at the same time, it's very easy to find and describe a functional
00:08:51 moral value.
00:08:52 To me, morality is obviously like anything that brings life is good and brings death is
00:08:59 bad.
00:09:01 I mean, sure, most people would agree with that, but that doesn't make it objective in
00:09:07 any sense.
00:09:08 Right.
00:09:09 Cancer is literally like just mutants and it's, and I don't like X-Men.
00:09:15 Sells are alive.
00:09:16 I don't like X-Men.
00:09:17 I think X-Men should die.
00:09:19 If something promotes death or marvels in the Mackey universe, then it's objectively
00:09:24 bad.
00:09:25 I guess to ask Nate about his pragmatic hedonism.
00:09:29 Do you think that it is in any way contradictory of being nihilistic?
00:09:34 Do you think that there is inherently value in being hedonistic or do you think it's more
00:09:41 like you appreciate that, but it doesn't inherently have meaning?
00:09:47 Well, I'm sort of jacking myself off a little bit by using a term like pragmatic hedonism.
00:09:52 We know.
00:09:53 We know.
00:09:54 Right.
00:09:55 This whole thing is fucking jack us off with big fancy words.
00:09:58 The fact that we're even using these.
00:10:00 It's really annoying me because like saying, oh yeah, this has no meaning.
00:10:05 Nothing has meaning.
00:10:06 Well, there you go.
00:10:07 That's nihilism.
00:10:08 But yeah, but like there's no different, like nothing, everything is, we ascribe things
00:10:16 to everything.
00:10:17 There is nothing inherent.
00:10:18 Right.
00:10:19 Inherency doesn't exist.
00:10:20 That's nihilism, hippo.
00:10:21 Yes.
00:10:22 Right, nihilism.
00:10:23 I know that we're all on board with that.
00:10:25 But the fact that there's so many different types is like, it's like no shit.
00:10:30 No shit that there's what there doesn't have.
00:10:33 Inherency in various different aspects of the universe.
00:10:36 But to answer Digi's question, though, so like the actual definition, I think it's just
00:10:41 like makes more sense is it's like this, whatever, pragmatic hedonism is just basically humanism.
00:10:45 So it's like, is human, like what is the, is, does that conflict with nihilism?
00:10:50 And I would argue absolutely not because my approach stems all from, at least I think
00:10:57 people try to say this.
00:10:58 I try to start with what seems to be the truth and then try to, from that foundation of things
00:11:03 that, as far as I can tell, are true, try to get to like the philosophy that seems like
00:11:08 it'll most get things the way I want them to go.
00:11:10 Now when you say true, you mean true like observable truth.
00:11:13 Not like a-
00:11:14 Because there is no other kind that we have.
00:11:15 Right.
00:11:16 There is no-
00:11:17 All we have is-
00:11:18 Object, there is no truth with a capital T.
00:11:20 Fucking observable truth is as good as truth.
00:11:22 So I don't-
00:11:23 Yeah, I completely agree with that view.
00:11:25 You know that thing where like you said, oh yeah, you can never actually touch anything
00:11:30 because your atoms are like pushing against the atoms of a thing.
00:11:32 Yeah, true.
00:11:33 They don't actually touch, you know.
00:11:34 I mean like there's no reason for that knowledge to-
00:11:37 Yeah, it's like you know what I mean.
00:11:39 I know you guys-
00:11:40 It could be helpful.
00:11:41 Like there is a reason for it, for that knowledge to exist and it's simply because without it-
00:11:46 To make you feel smooth, feel smart.
00:11:48 Without it we have like okay, if you're a religious person, then everything we're saying is blasphemy.
00:11:53 You know?
00:11:54 Like just to merely raise these ideas and like it's to make people understand that they're
00:12:00 like you believing in God doesn't make you right.
00:12:03 You know?
00:12:04 Like that's-
00:12:05 So you can feel smarter for not believing in God.
00:12:07 Well, so you can feel safe for not believing in God.
00:12:09 Busted.
00:12:10 So you can not be killed for not believing in God, you know?
00:12:13 It's to bust out all this science.
00:12:16 In casual conversation it makes you an asshole.
00:12:19 You know?
00:12:20 Like to just say this stuff apropos of nothing.
00:12:22 Yeah, if you're like you don't really-
00:12:24 If you're like oh I'm touching you and someone's like oh you don't really touching anything.
00:12:27 It's like a fuck you.
00:12:28 Yeah.
00:12:29 You know?
00:12:30 But like if you're trying to explain this to someone so that they can just like wrap their
00:12:33 head around the idea that you know there is no absolute truth in the universe therefore
00:12:38 we cannot have a religious society because it's based in nothing.
00:12:42 You know?
00:12:43 I guess I do see the purpose of nihilism to come up.
00:12:47 No.
00:12:48 Not in general like just like for once.
00:12:50 Like once.
00:12:51 Like every teenager should have a little pamphlet and says nothing exists you fucking idiot.
00:12:55 And then they read it and they're like okay they never have to talk about it again but
00:12:59 now they know and then they can do real human being things.
00:13:02 There's only a certain degree of like practical application that this knowledge has on your
00:13:06 life because like you're still gonna basically live everything the same way.
00:13:10 Even if you're somebody like me who doesn't believe that like consciousness or free will
00:13:14 are real.
00:13:15 Like you still operate in basically the exact same way and it changes nothing about your
00:13:19 day to day life.
00:13:20 That's why it's so funny to me that there's like 80 terms you know that's why it's hilarious.
00:13:25 I'm a fucking din of lions.
00:13:27 I'm surrounded by fucking medusas and ghouls and fucking monsters.
00:13:32 I am 100% an optimist and I will.
00:13:35 I'm an optimist.
00:13:36 That is not.
00:13:37 I'm an optimist.
00:13:38 Oh okay.
00:13:39 I gotta fight you on this Nate.
00:13:43 Consciousness is the only thing that is real.
00:13:47 You know that is true.
00:13:49 I guess I wouldn't say that consciousness isn't real but I would argue that it's very different
00:13:54 from the way it's generally perceived.
00:13:57 Because everything in the world we experience second hand but our consciousness and our
00:14:02 experiences are they are the only thing that is objectively observable and truth with a
00:14:09 capital T exist in my humble.
00:14:12 In this faggot's humble opinion.
00:14:14 I hear you're coming from that.
00:14:15 Well then you're not nihilistic anymore Ben.
00:14:17 You believe in an objective thing.
00:14:19 Yeah yeah well okay yeah that's what I said.
00:14:22 That's why I said that the ontological nihilism is clearly not true because we can fuck there
00:14:27 are fucking things we can there are things that we can observe are true.
00:14:31 What if they're all a simulation.
00:14:34 But the mind experiencing that simulation can't also be a simulation.
00:14:41 I think okay that's a fair point and to just cloudy the waters as much as possible at the
00:14:46 very beginning of this discussion before you go any further.
00:14:49 I just want to explain to anyone who doesn't know of the simulation theory that it is entirely
00:14:54 possible that the entire universe that you live in right now is in complete fabrication
00:15:00 because think about it.
00:15:01 Which affects nothing.
00:15:02 There's no like even if that is true that has no bearing on you whatsoever.
00:15:05 None of this affects anything.
00:15:06 To even talk about nihilism at all is like the most privileged conversation you can possibly
00:15:12 have.
00:15:13 Like it is it is the realm of we have got we have accomplished our base needs so well
00:15:19 that now we can just think about concepts that mean nothing.
00:15:23 It's pretty funny like no matter how unreal no matter how much of a simulation the world
00:15:28 is if I cut myself right now it's going to hurt and I'll need a bandaid you know it doesn't
00:15:32 matter how unreal it is.
00:15:34 It could matter though.
00:15:36 It could matter.
00:15:37 It fucking could matter.
00:15:40 I would I would argue that that knowledge just like the whole thing about how like pushing
00:15:44 your finger against your other finger technically no matter is touching any other matter.
00:15:48 But then again what exactly is matter is it the is it the potential cloud of electrons
00:15:54 What the fuck is that shit.
00:15:56 We don't know.
00:15:57 Right.
00:15:58 I just wanted to say that I thought it was really funny that nihilism like nihilists
00:16:03 have the least reason to discuss nihilism because of how pointless it is to discuss nihilism
00:16:09 because they're nihilists and yet the Wikipedia article is huge and there's so many different
00:16:14 types.
00:16:15 Checkmate nihilists.
00:16:16 Yeah well hey go look at the Christianity Wikipedia page though.
00:16:20 I bet it dwarfs this.
00:16:21 You mean the Bible.
00:16:24 Oh my god.
00:16:25 The original Wikipedia.
00:16:26 God's been editing that shit since 6000 BC though.
00:16:33 But yeah I guess it can be fun to speculate on stuff like that I guess.
00:16:38 I want to hear Munchie's position because it sounds like he's coming from a different
00:16:41 position than a lot of us in this.
00:16:43 Oh completely.
00:16:44 Okay.
00:16:45 I think you basically have to be retarded and like low functioning like you don't have
00:16:50 brain cells like an extra chromosome.
00:16:52 Hey man I went to college.
00:16:56 You have to go to college to be this dumb to get a nihilism.
00:17:00 Exactly.
00:17:01 As plankton famously said in SpongeBob the Musical I went to college so you know it's clever.
00:17:09 Sinusism and nihilism are just like coping methods for people who have an Hercules the
00:17:13 snake of depression in their crib like I did when I was a wee boy.
00:17:16 Sinusism doesn't have to be linked to nihilism but okay.
00:17:19 I just want to Munchie I think you'd appreciate this.
00:17:23 My favorite explanation of nihilism ever was a wholesome meme that Jesse posted one time.
00:17:29 Where on the left it was how people think nihilists are and it was a guy like crying in the rain
00:17:37 and going nothing matters and then on the right it was.
00:17:40 It was actually the little rad kid from the 90s.
00:17:42 Yeah rad 90s dude on a surfboard thumbs up and he's like nothing matters yeah and that's
00:17:47 how I feel all the time.
00:17:48 For me it's the most it is optimism is nihilism is to be like oh yeah none of this shit actually
00:17:54 matters and I really want to reiterate that like the foundation of this whole thing and
00:17:59 I generally agree with that almost entirely.
00:18:02 I think we might use different words but I think all of us agree on things probably the
00:18:06 vast majority of it except maybe Munchie but like all this comes from foundation of observed
00:18:11 truths that I have then been forced to construct a worldview from so I'm just trying to be as
00:18:16 accurate as possible and I'm generally also a pretty positive person so even though I think
00:18:21 that like the universe is doomed and that there's like no hope of anything that's in it right
00:18:25 now surviving in a few billion years and therefore my existence is objectively meaningless and
00:18:30 pointless like that doesn't matter.
00:18:32 I mean maybe we'll just make you know I was hoping to do that.
00:18:35 You described meaning to things by being alive.
00:18:38 Yeah yeah I mean to say that it's meaningless is to like is to place it within a framework
00:18:43 of like of thing of value.
00:18:45 Well it's just objectively meaningless but it's meaningful within the subjective experience
00:18:51 and I do value the subjective experience.
00:18:53 Well here's the like yeah like for something to matter like what does it mean for something to
00:18:58 matter and it's like well that means that like someone cares about it so it's like so if you
00:19:02 care about something then it matters.
00:19:04 But see I wouldn't I don't quite agree with that.
00:19:07 I do believe that consciousness is a valuable thing and worth you know like respecting and
00:19:11 protecting but like I don't know if like human like if there's if it all ends one day then
00:19:19 that all was cool for the people who experienced it but there was no real point to it.
00:19:24 Well no no no you're missing you're missing the point because the point is that like you you're
00:19:29 saying oh it doesn't matter because in the end it will all go away and like that's fine but like it
00:19:34 doesn't there's there's no objective standard for whether things matter that you can compare to
00:19:38 whether something matters or not is a matter of opinion you know.
00:19:41 The universe does not work on a scale of is it worth it or not.
00:19:46 It just exists and it is and eventually it will die.
00:19:49 I make it my goal to care about the universe so that it does matter.
00:19:52 I want to put it okay.
00:19:54 I think that okay yeah like the like the nothing matters like that's like that like epic like like
00:20:00 like like law sick skill streak is you know nice and whatever.
00:20:05 However I like it when things are I like it when I care about things I like it when things matter
00:20:11 and when things matter I don't necessarily like I of course I am like I I prepare for the worst
00:20:18 and hope for the best.
00:20:20 I know nothing actually matters and I know that there is no real and like you know tangible
00:20:25 like spirit or ghosts or anything.
00:20:28 But you know I just like it when I prescribe mean things because I'm a human and I like to
00:20:33 that's the best part is that for something it doesn't take anything all it takes for
00:20:37 something to matter is just that you care about it and then it matters.
00:20:41 I think the main thing that this is all like based on is that when you're a kid you don't
00:20:46 understand that things might not matter because you think the universe is centered around you.
00:20:51 Everybody's talking to you you're the main character which I would argue it basically is.
00:20:55 Yeah I mean when you're a kid.
00:20:57 Only for Monty though.
00:20:59 Yeah true but then like as you get a bit older you realize that you're just one of many human
00:21:04 beings and you're not actually that special but and you think oh maybe nothing matters
00:21:09 and you learn to be a nihilist but then I think it's sort of like a like a maturing of that idea
00:21:17 in your brain that makes you you know once you think that nothing matters then you can
00:21:23 care about things because there's nothing in your brain telling you oh you should be doing this
00:21:28 because you know other people say that you should do it or your parents or you know some other
00:21:33 higher power or like there's no rules in the universe so you feel better and it's really just
00:21:40 like a like a transitioning period away from thinking that things matter in terms of like
00:21:47 you know stuff that you don't like like you know parents telling you to go to college
00:21:51 and you don't want to go and but you think you have to because it matters and once you realize
00:21:56 that it doesn't then you can care about real things.
00:22:00 But to say nothing matters in that context.
00:22:03 Like the question of things don't matter so why would I go to college that that's that's where
00:22:08 the pragmatic side of this comes in because there's no point in like like if nothing matters
00:22:13 why don't I just lay down and die.
00:22:15 Yeah that's the middle point.
00:22:17 What I was trying to get at is like the middle point is like why don't I just kill myself.
00:22:21 Like I mean some people do that but some people don't and it's like parents say go to college
00:22:29 and you think that matters intrinsically and it's like the thing and then you realize that
00:22:33 nothing matters but then you may come you may come to think I want to go to college anyway
00:22:39 because I think it matters and then that that is that's a good point like it's like there's
00:22:44 an intrinsic truth being told to us and I think probably all of us except maybe Munch when
00:22:48 we were young certainly got fed the college will be the answer to all your problems and
00:22:52 life and what you do and you did OK OK and then like you know it certainly can help in
00:22:57 some ways but like we have all grown up and learned that college is in fact not actually
00:23:02 a magical solution to all your problems economic and otherwise in fact it's a magical problem
00:23:07 that will ruin your life.
00:23:09 I am currently saddled with quite a bit of fucking debt that I'm slowly working my way
00:23:13 out of and in fact I'm not too far away from but like it has been a burden on me for years
00:23:18 and then like all my goal in life now is just to quickly get away from the you know you
00:23:23 know you don't have to pay off that debt because when your parents die then you'll inherit
00:23:28 all of their money and so their money is basically your money so well my parents are going to live
00:23:33 for at least a while.
00:23:35 I don't want to have to pay a student loan every month.
00:23:40 I was just quoting Ben's argument for why he's the last student of us.
00:23:44 I'd like to distance myself from that quote as much as possible actually.
00:23:51 So you've taken it back now I should stop.
00:23:54 I should stop explaining to people that this is Ben's fault.
00:23:58 I felt so shitty as soon as that came out of my mouth.
00:24:01 I was like oh god no come on.
00:24:04 That's an appropriate feeling to have.
00:24:06 It's one of my favorite things anyone's ever said to be perfectly honest.
00:24:11 It's very Ben.
00:24:12 Ben St. you know a stitches head out of the dumpster he's currently in and just spouts
00:24:16 off a one liner like that I don't want to know why.
00:24:18 I hate you.
00:24:19 I hate you.
00:24:20 That's all I have to say.
00:24:24 Oh fuck I completely forgot what I was going to bring up earlier.
00:24:27 Oh yeah.
00:24:28 So time.
00:24:31 Time's not real right?
00:24:34 Hang on.
00:24:35 I saw gun buster.
00:24:36 Well it's like another dimension right?
00:24:39 It's not that it's not real.
00:24:42 It's real because we can come up with a definition of what it means when we talk about time.
00:24:48 I spent a long time thinking that time was in fact not real and it was just a way that
00:24:52 we accounted for it.
00:24:53 This stuff was this way at one point and then things move and now they're this way.
00:24:57 It turns out that is in fact not true because time is a measurable phenomenon in the universe
00:25:02 that can be accounted for.
00:25:03 Time is like something that stuff in the universe experiences but it's not like there's like
00:25:09 an outside of time right?
00:25:11 What are you guys talking about?
00:25:13 Is it time obviously exists?
00:25:15 Is it or is it not true that all time exists at once?
00:25:22 All of the time of the universe's existence.
00:25:25 Are you smoking from the outside at all?
00:25:28 That's a fucked up question because you can't say that it all exists at once because by
00:25:31 saying at once you're referencing the concept of time.
00:25:35 Shit.
00:25:36 How can we get away?
00:25:38 Is there a time when time began?
00:25:40 I think they're probably what?
00:25:42 8.50pm.
00:25:43 Yeah.
00:25:44 Today.
00:25:45 You know what?
00:25:46 I really feel like...
00:25:47 Does the concept of beginning exist outside of what we...
00:25:50 Dude.
00:25:51 I really feel bad.
00:25:52 Doesn't matter at all though.
00:25:54 I really feel bad.
00:25:55 I feel like I should be the expert on this question because I have like a physics degree
00:26:00 but like I really don't fucking know what to say about this shit.
00:26:03 I fucking have it.
00:26:05 I fucking have it.
00:26:07 Time has just started.
00:26:09 Before that that was just like a memory, like a made up...
00:26:12 We just thought that all of our entire lives just happened.
00:26:15 Like that was just a joke as a meme.
00:26:17 It started now.
00:26:19 What you're referring to is a very common...
00:26:22 Yeah, go ahead.
00:26:23 Sorry.
00:26:24 I'm just trying to get at that like the end of the universe is already...
00:26:27 When it happens it will always be in the now, right?
00:26:31 Kind of like what CGP Grey was saying about how you don't die in the future.
00:26:35 You always die right now.
00:26:37 It's just not necessarily...
00:26:39 The thing about that isn't quite accurate.
00:26:42 It's not quite accurate to say that like...
00:26:44 It's not accurate.
00:26:45 It's just that we use the word future to mean a thing.
00:26:49 We know the future doesn't exist because it can never exist.
00:26:53 This is all some slippery language.
00:26:55 This is all some slippery language shenanigans.
00:26:57 I'm just saying that the universe has already ended.
00:27:01 Like it's already there.
00:27:03 That's not true.
00:27:05 But it's not here now. It's in the future.
00:27:07 It's in the future. There's time between now and then.
00:27:09 In this moment that I'm speaking.
00:27:11 Digi, are you just talking about the...
00:27:13 I forgot what the term is.
00:27:15 Like it's...
00:27:17 Time is...
00:27:19 Deterministic.
00:27:21 That's the word I'm looking for.
00:27:23 Maybe the universe is fully deterministic
00:27:25 and the end is already written into the beginning.
00:27:27 It's all in a set path.
00:27:29 Actually, you know what?
00:27:31 That's a great topic to bring up because I literally believe
00:27:33 that there is no reason to not think that the universe is 100% deterministic
00:27:37 because the only way that you could object to that
00:27:40 is to argue that free will exists
00:27:42 in some way or that the age is within the universe.
00:27:44 That argument makes no sense at all.
00:27:46 The existence of free will makes no sense.
00:27:48 Exactly.
00:27:50 You don't have to argue for free will to argue against determinism
00:27:53 because there could still be randomness.
00:27:55 That's true.
00:27:57 But the only way you can make that argument
00:28:00 is that you have to say that there is some force that acts on the universe
00:28:03 outside of just physics.
00:28:05 No, that's not true.
00:28:07 Randomness operates.
00:28:09 Some things can just be random. Why not?
00:28:11 Randomness isn't actually real as I understand it.
00:28:17 Is there any evidence for randomness?
00:28:19 Yes.
00:28:21 What is the evidence for randomness?
00:28:23 What I'm saying is that there are only
00:28:25 the types of forces that exist that we know of
00:28:27 in terms of physics as we understand it now.
00:28:29 Things happen the way they would have happened
00:28:31 based on cause and effect.
00:28:33 No.
00:28:35 There's randomness.
00:28:37 No, no, no.
00:28:39 I see the argument for not randomness is
00:28:41 say if everybody does the exact same muscle movement
00:28:45 throughout the entire history of the universe.
00:28:47 Anything that can move moves in exactly the same way
00:28:50 every single time.
00:28:52 Physics would follow, I think,
00:28:54 is the idea.
00:28:56 The whole universe would fall because
00:28:59 a person stepped on it twice.
00:29:02 And if they step on it,
00:29:05 the exact history of them
00:29:07 getting to that place with that particular shoe
00:29:09 and stepping on it exactly the same way
00:29:11 twice in another version of the same universe,
00:29:14 it would fall at the exact same time in the exact same way.
00:29:17 Let me just get this out there
00:29:19 so we can proceed with this knowledge.
00:29:21 The most fundamental physical things and events
00:29:25 happen at a small enough scale,
00:29:27 and at that scale things are determined randomly.
00:29:30 The best understanding of the universe
00:29:32 is that things literally are entirely built
00:29:34 on probabilities.
00:29:36 Isn't that just our best understanding?
00:29:38 Well, it might be.
00:29:40 If it's your best understanding,
00:29:42 it might just be our best understanding.
00:29:44 There could be something underlying it
00:29:46 that is deterministic, but we don't know that.
00:29:48 And why would we think that there necessarily has to be?
00:29:50 It just doesn't seem like it makes any sense
00:29:52 for anything to be banned back.
00:29:54 Oh, that's a great fucking argument.
00:29:56 Oh, it doesn't feel right.
00:29:58 Well, that's our best knowledge.
00:30:00 Our best knowledge, and it gets that quick.
00:30:02 Is it the absolute truth?
00:30:04 I don't know, but it's the best we've got.
00:30:06 I would say there's a difference between
00:30:08 functionally random and truly random.
00:30:10 This is truly random.
00:30:12 Our best understanding is based on true randomness.
00:30:14 Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge.
00:30:16 Here we go.
00:30:18 Here's some knowledge.
00:30:20 Photons.
00:30:22 They're like, what do you call them?
00:30:24 Paradoxical.
00:30:26 They can exist in two places at once, provably.
00:30:28 They did like...
00:30:30 I can't remember what it was called.
00:30:32 There's an experiment where they fire a single photon
00:30:34 in a thing.
00:30:36 And instead of like it being like a dot
00:30:38 that hits one, like there's this sheet,
00:30:40 a sheet of something that
00:30:42 detects photons, it was like
00:30:44 they shot it and it like
00:30:46 appeared in multiple places
00:30:48 even though it was just one thing and it didn't split.
00:30:50 Yeah, it's Young's double slit experiment.
00:30:52 Yeah.
00:30:54 It's not that the photons are...
00:30:56 I don't want to get into it.
00:30:58 Hang on, hang on.
00:31:00 It's possible that something could exist
00:31:02 in two places at once, but that's different from random.
00:31:04 It's not...
00:31:06 Since we're on this topic,
00:31:08 I'll flex my nuts a little bit more
00:31:10 and say that it's not so much
00:31:12 that they exist at multiple places at once.
00:31:14 It's that their existence is
00:31:16 spread across a continuum
00:31:18 of probabilities of location.
00:31:20 And that those probabilities...
00:31:22 Okay, so like the existence is a wave
00:31:24 form of probability that it like
00:31:26 undulates
00:31:28 through space, and that the measurement,
00:31:30 a measurement of the photon's location
00:31:32 will determine
00:31:34 and determine that it's actually located
00:31:36 at just one of those places,
00:31:38 but until the measurement is made,
00:31:40 it is not localized.
00:31:42 It is a spread of probabilities.
00:31:44 Okay, but here's my question.
00:31:46 If under the exact same circumstances
00:31:48 we were able to like...
00:31:50 form this experiment again,
00:31:52 and the first time that we did it before we reset the universe,
00:31:54 we got X result.
00:31:56 If we did that experiment again,
00:31:58 would we get the same result?
00:32:00 Or would it be somewhere else?
00:32:02 Our best understanding
00:32:04 of the phenomenon is that no,
00:32:06 we would not necessarily get the same result.
00:32:08 Okay, well that's important.
00:32:10 I think that's important to understand.
00:32:12 I think...
00:32:14 If I just have the floor here,
00:32:16 I think that all of this has been
00:32:18 the worst experience of my life
00:32:20 with all the reasons.
00:32:22 All of these...
00:32:24 All of these vague,
00:32:26 you know...
00:32:28 Disgusting, smart,
00:32:30 smart terms such as
00:32:32 slice of life, time...
00:32:34 All of these...
00:32:36 All of these terms, like words
00:32:38 and beliefs...
00:32:40 Munchie dropped out of Clown College,
00:32:42 so we wouldn't have to hear these kind of arguments anymore.
00:32:44 He was sick of all this fancy
00:32:46 and that's why he became a street juggalo
00:32:48 where the world should happen.
00:32:50 He dropped out of ICPU.
00:32:52 Yeah, exactly.
00:32:54 Here's my political
00:32:56 and philosophical beliefs.
00:32:58 It's a new thing that I've just admitted.
00:33:00 It's called real meatism,
00:33:02 where I believe in real meat only.
00:33:04 Which means...
00:33:06 All of these things,
00:33:08 like, okay, time.
00:33:10 You can argue all you want about
00:33:12 shit that doesn't matter, like time,
00:33:14 is there a beginning of time?
00:33:16 Sure, it's nice to know that
00:33:18 for textbooks and so we can know more about the world
00:33:20 so we can conquer it.
00:33:22 But that's the thing, I only care about that
00:33:24 because it will benefit me to know that
00:33:26 so I can destroy other civilizations
00:33:28 in my future.
00:33:30 I only care about
00:33:32 things that will impact me.
00:33:34 And I only care...
00:33:36 There's no reason for me
00:33:38 to care
00:33:40 about the highfalutin
00:33:42 concepts in life.
00:33:44 There's no reason to get bogged down
00:33:46 in the minutiae.
00:33:48 This isn't exactly what we were just talking about,
00:33:50 but I bring this topic up a lot
00:33:52 and I don't go into it too often,
00:33:54 but I would argue to you
00:33:56 I think there is an excellent case to be made
00:33:58 that you in fact have
00:34:00 literally no control
00:34:02 over your life.
00:34:04 You have zero control.
00:34:06 You are simply an automaton acting upon biological
00:34:08 impulses that are just physical
00:34:10 reactions to things.
00:34:12 Everything you think you're doing in your life
00:34:14 is not actually you. You're not accomplishing
00:34:16 anything.
00:34:18 You are a witness to the events happening
00:34:20 in your body.
00:34:22 Are you talking about free will or what are you saying here?
00:34:24 Free will. This is about free will.
00:34:26 Yeah.
00:34:28 Sure, I agree.
00:34:30 All of our actions are based on
00:34:32 what we have learned.
00:34:34 But here's the thing about real metism.
00:34:36 Basically,
00:34:38 I operate on
00:34:40 a language
00:34:42 I don't know how to describe it.
00:34:44 I operate on good enough.
00:34:46 Like JavaScript language or Python?
00:34:48 I run on C++ actually.
00:34:50 I'm looking for a degree here.
00:34:52 It's good enough
00:34:54 to say that there is free will.
00:34:56 Because everyone will know
00:34:58 what you mean by free will.
00:35:00 I can move my arm.
00:35:02 I'm not limited by a government
00:35:04 kind of robot.
00:35:06 I can do that.
00:35:08 Me and Victor have been on this weird
00:35:10 Cold War argument across our different
00:35:12 Digi Bros. playthroughs about free will.
00:35:14 Where he's trying to argue that free will
00:35:16 is real and I'm trying to argue that it's not.
00:35:18 But we're really arguing two different layers
00:35:20 of the problem.
00:35:22 I'm arguing it on a
00:35:24 metaphysical or whatever level.
00:35:26 What's the word I'm looking for?
00:35:28 Philosophical level.
00:35:30 He's arguing it on a
00:35:32 everyday life.
00:35:34 Oh my god, let's decide
00:35:36 what your life is level.
00:35:38 The only thing that you can
00:35:40 The only thing that can be
00:35:42 determined by
00:35:44 free will, yes, no,
00:35:46 is what happens when time
00:35:48 travel is invented. If you go back
00:35:50 and there's no free will.
00:35:52 When?
00:35:54 Can you change the future
00:35:56 and do timeline offshoots exist?
00:35:58 If free will will determine
00:36:00 whether that is how time travel works
00:36:02 or if it's the other way
00:36:04 it'll be a different way.
00:36:06 It will settle that question.
00:36:08 When you say
00:36:10 your atoms will not go together
00:36:12 and when you're touching something
00:36:14 you're not really touching it.
00:36:16 It's good enough to say that you are touching it.
00:36:18 That works for you because
00:36:20 you are a human and your eyes can't zoom
00:36:22 in that big.
00:36:24 You don't have that big telescope
00:36:26 in your brain.
00:36:28 That question could be useful.
00:36:30 I'm not saying that it doesn't
00:36:32 deserve to exist or that we shouldn't
00:36:34 research the sciences. I'm just saying
00:36:36 for all intents and purposes
00:36:38 for my daily life
00:36:40 I don't need to know that.
00:36:42 I need to know that in case I am a physicist.
00:36:44 In order to live a human life
00:36:46 I want to say that things matter
00:36:48 and the only
00:36:50 things that do matter to me are the things
00:36:52 that I can observe as a human.
00:36:54 That's such a limited amount of information.
00:36:56 No, but that's what I'm saying.
00:36:58 You don't need to understand anything
00:37:00 in order to determine whether something matters
00:37:02 or not because it's totally a matter of opinion.
00:37:04 Let's get over that.
00:37:06 Matters of opinion are only things that
00:37:08 are human.
00:37:10 Imagine you're at a party
00:37:12 or at some place and you're talking to a guy
00:37:14 and you don't know who he is
00:37:16 and
00:37:18 there's conversations that come up and you're like
00:37:20 did you know I'm touching this?
00:37:22 He's like yeah, that's true.
00:37:24 I like that one.
00:37:26 Because it's not annoying.
00:37:28 But if he starts going
00:37:30 I will actually atom some bullshit
00:37:32 and I'm like I just don't like you now.
00:37:34 You've ruined this friendship.
00:37:36 I want to state by the way
00:37:38 while this has been going on
00:37:40 I still like you hippo, so there.
00:37:42 While this has been going on I decided
00:37:44 I'm not a nihilist.
00:37:46 I am actually an absurdist
00:37:48 and I don't think that's actually
00:37:50 a thing people call themselves.
00:37:52 It's actually just a genre of fiction
00:37:54 but it's a better description because
00:37:56 I feel like nihilism
00:37:58 believes that
00:38:00 there just is no meaning
00:38:02 but absurdism is about
00:38:04 how humans can't find meaning.
00:38:06 Like that maybe there's meaning
00:38:08 but there's no
00:38:10 possible way that humans could ever understand it.
00:38:12 There can't be meaning
00:38:14 outside of a conscious
00:38:16 being that determines me.
00:38:18 That's just nihilism with a clown afro.
00:38:20 Why can there not be meaning outside of
00:38:22 Well, because like I've been saying
00:38:24 like I've been saying this whole time
00:38:26 meaning is just an opinion
00:38:28 You need to be a living thinking thing
00:38:30 in order to have such an opinion.
00:38:32 Are you telling me that if a tree falls
00:38:34 in the forest and no one's around to hear it
00:38:36 it does not make a sound?
00:38:38 Well, I mean
00:38:40 I see what you're saying
00:38:42 and I think it depends on what you mean by sound.
00:38:44 If you mean the physical
00:38:46 sensation of hearing a thing
00:38:48 then no, but if you mean
00:38:50 the concussion of the airwaves then yes.
00:38:52 Yeah, the
00:38:54 the vibrations of the tree
00:38:56 falling down will damage the tree
00:38:58 and then that will be
00:39:00 like you go and record it
00:39:02 like oh this tree has like sound wave
00:39:04 damage we can tell
00:39:06 use this new technology
00:39:08 to hear how this tree fell.
00:39:10 Has it not reached the sound until it's been observed?
00:39:14 Well, if there's a way in the future
00:39:16 there's like a special gadget
00:39:18 that can like scan
00:39:20 the vibration thing
00:39:22 of like a tree.
00:39:24 I don't know, I want to go here
00:39:26 alright?
00:39:28 If there's a gadget that can like scan
00:39:30 a tree to see how
00:39:32 like the vibrations have affected it
00:39:34 we can hear the trees like
00:39:36 ear, like what it heard
00:39:38 we can hear
00:39:40 what the tree is
00:39:42 and that would be fucking sick.
00:39:44 Yeah, like you're saying we could measure
00:39:46 the effects, the past effects
00:39:48 of a tree having fall.
00:39:50 If a tree fell through a vacuum
00:39:52 and made a sound.
00:39:54 How does it benefit the universe to have meaning?
00:39:56 There's no reason for the universe to have meaning.
00:39:58 Yeah, no, there's no reason.
00:40:00 Meaning is for humans to want things.
00:40:02 We don't know that, what if there's something beyond
00:40:04 the universe that has its own
00:40:06 why would you assume that?
00:40:08 Possibly know what that is though.
00:40:10 That's what I'm saying
00:40:12 like absurdism, it's where you can't
00:40:14 you just can't possibly know
00:40:16 because it's hard.
00:40:18 You have no reason to believe exists
00:40:20 if you're asserting that that's real.
00:40:22 I mean are you talking about some
00:40:24 like extra dimensional aliens basically?
00:40:26 Possibly or anything
00:40:28 like it's beyond
00:40:30 beyond my ability to imagine
00:40:32 is what I'm saying. Well I think that
00:40:34 yeah, well they might be different
00:40:36 I think like fundamentally they have to be
00:40:38 similar to us and that they have to be conscious
00:40:40 of thinking beings in order to have meaning.
00:40:42 Why? Why? I don't agree with that.
00:40:44 Because meaning itself is a concept
00:40:46 we have made up for a thing that we decided
00:40:48 that we wanted so like meaning as we
00:40:50 understand it can only arise from like
00:40:52 a similar consciousness.
00:40:54 I can believe
00:40:56 I can believe and agree with the idea
00:40:58 that we can't know where the homestuck is real
00:41:00 but I would like to know.
00:41:02 So the term meaning
00:41:04 is it accurate to say the term meaning
00:41:06 is really defined in sort of like
00:41:08 as the biological organisms are
00:41:10 we have biological imperatives
00:41:12 and we've sort of defined the word meaning
00:41:14 based on our desires and urges
00:41:16 as the creatures that we are
00:41:18 and like what we want to accomplish.
00:41:20 Is there anything beyond like what else could there be?
00:41:22 How else could you define what that means?
00:41:24 To change the subject slightly
00:41:26 I want to know if anybody else has this experience.
00:41:28 Do you ever have moments
00:41:30 where you like you're having
00:41:32 too good of a time
00:41:34 and you start to wonder
00:41:36 if you are actually
00:41:38 like this is all hallucination
00:41:40 like you actually lost your mind a couple years ago
00:41:42 and you're
00:41:44 you're sure.
00:41:46 No, I'm not quite that drastic.
00:41:48 Sometimes when I'm
00:41:50 with my girlfriend
00:41:52 I wonder if she's just a real doll
00:41:54 that I've convinced myself is human.
00:41:56 That's adorable.
00:41:58 And true.
00:42:00 What if
00:42:02 everyone's just humoring me
00:42:04 like
00:42:06 What if I'm convincing
00:42:08 ventriloquist.
00:42:10 That's where
00:42:12 Occam's razor is easy to
00:42:14 utilize.
00:42:16 It's be a lot of work for everyone to like
00:42:18 placate you and make you think.
00:42:20 What if I'm just an insane person hallucinating
00:42:22 everything in insane detail.
00:42:24 What if I'm just in a mental
00:42:26 facility.
00:42:28 Occam's razor is a useful tool
00:42:30 for deciding what's like
00:42:32 helpful, but it's not
00:42:34 a way to arrive at truth.
00:42:36 You don't determine anything
00:42:38 objective by applying Occam's razor to it.
00:42:40 But technically we could all be
00:42:42 we could all be aliens
00:42:44 playing different versions of Roy at the moment
00:42:46 is the idea.
00:42:48 That's correct.
00:42:50 I hope that that's true so bad.
00:42:52 Because then I can wake up and be like oh yeah
00:42:54 a blurb blarp.
00:42:56 In the event that we are all a simulation
00:42:58 would you still say that we think therefore
00:43:00 at least on a functional
00:43:02 level.
00:43:04 In this scenario
00:43:06 where you're just an insane person like begging your head
00:43:08 against a wall in an insane asylum.
00:43:10 And none of you are real.
00:43:12 For all intents and purposes this is real.
00:43:14 This is the same thing with the simulation
00:43:16 like Matrix World.
00:43:18 Does it matter that it's not real because you're
00:43:20 experiencing all these emotions and feelings
00:43:22 in real life.
00:43:24 Functionally and for all intents and purposes real.
00:43:26 You know what this touches on.
00:43:28 It really matters.
00:43:30 Objectivity doesn't exist.
00:43:32 That is true.
00:43:34 Let's talk about this for a second.
00:43:36 There are some things that are objective.
00:43:38 Just throw that out there.
00:43:40 When it comes to what we experience
00:43:42 our whole perception of the universe
00:43:44 and everything we know just comes
00:43:46 through the crude matter of our
00:43:48 senses and what we can observe
00:43:50 and what we can process into our brain through our eyes
00:43:52 our taste buds
00:43:54 our nose. Most importantly our dicks.
00:43:56 All these things.
00:43:58 None of them are perfectly reliable
00:44:00 ever. All the time we hear stories
00:44:02 of people who are hallucinating
00:44:04 so none of these are 100% reliable.
00:44:06 So all of this shit
00:44:08 could totally be fake.
00:44:10 Sure.
00:44:12 Ben you say some things are objective.
00:44:14 Approve it.
00:44:16 The existence of your mind.
00:44:18 2 equals 4?
00:44:20 That's objectively true
00:44:22 because we've defined those terms
00:44:24 into each other in a way that's just
00:44:26 a function of the system of math that we've created.
00:44:28 So that's definitionally true.
00:44:30 But outside of definitions
00:44:32 and things like that
00:44:34 like fucking
00:44:36 Descartes and all that shit.
00:44:38 The existence of the self.
00:44:40 Descartes and all that shit.
00:44:42 It's a fucking old hat at this point.
00:44:44 I want that as an overheard conversation
00:44:46 in the background of a party
00:44:48 in Rick and Morty or something.
00:44:50 Descartes and all that shit.
00:44:52 So for you could be being fooled
00:44:54 and all the things you believe are true could be false
00:44:56 but for you to believe those false things
00:44:58 you have to exist in some form
00:45:00 in order to believe them.
00:45:02 The existence of the self
00:45:04 even if the things that you think you're experiencing
00:45:06 are not as you believe they are
00:45:08 the experiences themselves are real.
00:45:10 But it's only true from
00:45:12 only you can prove to yourself
00:45:14 that you are experienced.
00:45:16 We are currently proving to everyone
00:45:18 other than ourselves that they are real
00:45:20 but to us we are proving we are real.
00:45:24 I would argue that if you all are in fact real
00:45:26 which I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt
00:45:28 and assume that you are.
00:45:30 But if you are real and experiencing consciousnesses
00:45:32 then your consciousnesses
00:45:34 and your experiences are objectively real
00:45:36 if they are indeed occurring.
00:45:40 If I write a character
00:45:42 and I write them in such a depth
00:45:44 as though they had full
00:45:46 conscious thought
00:45:48 like what if we are just
00:45:50 characters
00:45:52 I write down that with the Japanese Juggalo
00:45:54 and he is living with me right now
00:45:56 I can look at him right now
00:45:58 so I proved your point.
00:46:00 I don't see how you can get around the idea that you have to be real
00:46:02 you have to exist to experience something.
00:46:04 You could program a cyber brain
00:46:06 right?
00:46:08 Like what if we're all just going
00:46:10 through all the subroutines we've been programmed with?
00:46:12 Which we are.
00:46:14 That's what a mind is
00:46:16 that's what a brain is
00:46:18 that would be
00:46:20 we're all made of stuff.
00:46:22 The constant
00:46:24 with all of this
00:46:26 the thing that is always true
00:46:28 and the most objective thing
00:46:30 it is the biggest
00:46:32 waste of time ever
00:46:34 to talk and think and ponder about this
00:46:36 because it always comes back to
00:46:38 well I guess it might be
00:46:40 That's what you think until now we discover
00:46:42 like they didn't gun buster how to use dolphins
00:46:44 to travel through space
00:46:46 to travel through space
00:46:48 to travel through space
00:46:50 when we get them dolphins hooked up boy
00:46:52 but how can mirrors be real
00:46:54 if our eyes aren't real
00:46:56 on that exact quote
00:46:58 the objective truth shouldn't be pursued
00:47:00 just for normal instances it's retarded
00:47:02 this is what I was trying to get to before
00:47:04 I talk about how
00:47:06 the things that we observe we can't guarantee
00:47:08 that any of that is real or true
00:47:10 like is my color blue the same as what you see as the color blue
00:47:12 what the fuck knows there's no way to prove it
00:47:14 what I would say is that I believe
00:47:16 dude hold on real quick
00:47:18 you brought up that Vsauce thing
00:47:20 and I didn't even need to bring up Vsauce
00:47:22 Vsauce doesn't have a patent on that
00:47:24 Munchy said Vsauce
00:47:26 and when I saw that Vsauce video
00:47:28 it had pissed me off so much
00:47:30 because they presented that like it was this really mind blowing
00:47:32 concept and I literally
00:47:34 just thought that on my own when I was 10
00:47:36 I mean I think everyone does
00:47:38 what if your blue's not my blue
00:47:40 and I was like dude what if your blue
00:47:42 isn't my blue
00:47:44 and I was like are you fucking serious
00:47:46 oh that blue is in my mind
00:47:48 and that was why I never watched Vsauce again
00:47:50 Vsauce is just for babies
00:47:52 it is
00:47:54 I was thinking that as a baby
00:47:56 I was thinking that as a baby
00:47:58 it's the first thing I fucking said
00:48:00 I just slid out the womb
00:48:02 I said that color is probably
00:48:04 different for you
00:48:06 I literally remember having that
00:48:08 realization and conversation
00:48:10 right after watching The Matrix 2
00:48:12 like me and my family were in a denny's
00:48:14 after watching The Matrix 2
00:48:16 and I was talking to Victor and I was like dude
00:48:18 what if your green's not my green
00:48:20 Matrix 2 much regarded as the most
00:48:22 intellectual of The Matrix series
00:48:24 but anyway
00:48:26 one time I had food poisoning
00:48:28 I was at my friend's house and then
00:48:30 the dad came over and they were like hey are you alright
00:48:32 I was like yeah but I don't understand
00:48:34 why can't I switch to the third person like I can
00:48:36 in video games
00:48:38 why are my eyes in this position only
00:48:40 why can't I see behind me
00:48:42 it's a real thing I actually said
00:48:44 while I had food poisoning that's not a joke
00:48:46 I like that
00:48:48 so
00:48:50 this is the thing that I believe
00:48:52 even though I actually don't have any
00:48:54 concrete proof that it is true
00:48:56 but I believe that there is a
00:48:58 highest level
00:49:00 an objective true
00:49:02 world
00:49:04 would be in a simulation easily
00:49:06 let's say I'm in The Matrix
00:49:08 we're up one level from that
00:49:10 we're looking at my body in a pod or whatever
00:49:12 so this is a higher level world
00:49:14 and that stuff all looks true
00:49:16 and even though the people up there
00:49:18 are still perceiving everything with their eyes
00:49:20 which makes it therefore objectively
00:49:22 not the accurate representation
00:49:24 exactly of what it really is
00:49:26 as true as the Lord Jesus
00:49:28 made it
00:49:30 you can go up as high as you want
00:49:32 through artificial world
00:49:34 through data escape or whatever
00:49:36 I'm talking about if you go all the way up
00:49:38 to the highest one that there is
00:49:40 I'm just saying this from an outsider
00:49:42 you just know that this is as high as you can go
00:49:44 if you know that that's true
00:49:46 the buck has to stop somewhere
00:49:48 it has to stop somewhere
00:49:50 there has to be an upper limit to it at some point
00:49:52 and
00:49:54 even though the people on that level
00:49:56 again they still have sensory organs
00:49:58 probably
00:50:00 perceiving things in the same way that's imperfect
00:50:02 but on that top level
00:50:04 the world that exists there
00:50:06 that is the objectively real
00:50:08 true world
00:50:10 that is the one
00:50:12 no one can experience that themselves
00:50:14 but it is there
00:50:16 and it is objective
00:50:18 that is what I strongly believe
00:50:20 even though I don't know it's 100% true
00:50:22 to me that seems quite likely
00:50:24 that that's the way things work
00:50:26 here's my philosophy
00:50:28 something may exist and all that
00:50:30 all that jazz
00:50:32 but getting a boner is pretty good
00:50:34 so I'm going to do that over and over
00:50:36 that's kind of
00:50:38 that's real meatism
00:50:40 that's real meatism
00:50:42 that's a good segue
00:50:44 that's a good segue
00:50:46 I think this is a subject that
00:50:48 in terms of nihilism a lot of people immediately jump to
00:50:50 and it's like good and evil
00:50:52 good and evil
00:50:54 is it real?
00:50:56 yes and I am both
00:50:58 at once
00:51:00 can we all agree
00:51:02 immediately that good and evil
00:51:04 have been defined by humans
00:51:06 they're entirely based on our
00:51:08 understanding of what we are
00:51:10 here's my thoughts on that
00:51:12 I strongly believe that
00:51:14 saying that something is good
00:51:16 is literally the same thing
00:51:18 completely interchangeable
00:51:20 linguistically
00:51:22 with just saying that you like it
00:51:24 bad is literally the same statement
00:51:26 as saying I don't like it
00:51:28 that's what it boils down to
00:51:30 people have tried to argue with me on this
00:51:32 and I've never been convinced that this is wrong
00:51:34 it explains everything
00:51:36 we should just replace language with little emojis
00:51:38 we should have a happy face
00:51:40 when you're good
00:51:42 yes
00:51:44 angry face when you see a bad man
00:51:46 you don't like him
00:51:48 I want to be able to downvote people in real life
00:51:50 and things and interactions
00:51:52 I'm gonna pee so bad
00:51:54 I'm so sorry
00:51:56 forgive me
00:51:58 dude
00:52:00 it could be like bronicon
00:52:02 you could have like a little thing around your neck
00:52:04 and if you're happy
00:52:06 turn it around upset
00:52:08 please do not approach me
00:52:10 I'm upset
00:52:12 I like how in real life you want to
00:52:14 lay on yours around your neck to simulate
00:52:16 what it feels like in your head
00:52:18 when you can just use your face
00:52:20 you've got a fucking reins attached to his face
00:52:22 that's what I liked about
00:52:24 bronicon
00:52:26 when are we going back? when
00:52:28 as soon as possible
00:52:30 so
00:52:32 I'm gonna camp outside bronicon to get the new
00:52:34 iPhone
00:52:36 like horse
00:52:38 are we done talking about Niles?
00:52:40 I've got one more point I want to make here
00:52:42 so Ben was saying all that bullshit
00:52:44 that I don't care about
00:52:46 but
00:52:48 like originally
00:52:50 the first life form that came to exist on earth
00:52:52 was functioning based on purely like
00:52:54 attraction versus repulsion
00:52:56 like attraction toward food
00:52:58 in whatever sensory organs it had to do that
00:53:00 and then repulsion from like probably things like danger
00:53:02 or yeah like danger
00:53:04 would probably be the only thing which is
00:53:06 it all just boils down to like
00:53:08 good, bad
00:53:10 like I want to go towards this food
00:53:12 I'm gonna go away from this shit I don't want
00:53:14 and we're talking about like a single celled organism
00:53:16 by touching it
00:53:18 and then it just like tries to stay away from shit that'll
00:53:20 like eat it or kill it or poison it or
00:53:22 whatever the fuck
00:53:24 so like I considering I think that humans are just
00:53:26 you know that organism
00:53:28 evolved and it kept evolving and evolving and eventually we've got human beings
00:53:30 people think that like the system
00:53:32 of morality that's in place you know
00:53:34 like religious terms have been passed down
00:53:36 but it seems to me all
00:53:38 super easily explainable just in terms of
00:53:40 again biological imperatives
00:53:42 so I just want to make this super clear to people
00:53:44 that good and evil
00:53:46 I don't think is objectively
00:53:48 true in any way but what I actually
00:53:50 I actually have a little bit different from some people
00:53:52 and I think that there sort of is an objectivity
00:53:54 element to this
00:53:56 which is that there are
00:53:58 it's even a little fuzzy to say but there are
00:54:00 basically objective truths
00:54:02 in that like there are experiences that are
00:54:04 like positive and negative for people
00:54:06 like death
00:54:08 not all the time but generally
00:54:10 that it is like an objectively
00:54:12 bad thing to do and I know I'm mixing generally
00:54:14 and objectively but like death is
00:54:16 objectively bad but what makes like
00:54:18 life occasionally like less
00:54:20 preferable to death is all like this terrible
00:54:22 shit happening that that corrupts
00:54:24 what life is supposed to be and like pleasure
00:54:26 generally preferable to pain
00:54:28 and so I really think this is my like hedonism
00:54:30 shit I think it makes sense
00:54:32 to like construct your life and your world
00:54:34 in such a way that you maximize
00:54:36 pleasure and minimize pain
00:54:38 and that doesn't even mean like hooking yourself
00:54:40 up to like a pleasure machine
00:54:42 or just doing heroin all the time
00:54:44 would it be like a maximize pleasure
00:54:46 and minimize pain, asterisks
00:54:48 unless you like pain
00:54:50 if so that would just be pleasure for you
00:54:52 it's like your thing
00:54:54 but with a little asterisks like unless not
00:54:56 unless different
00:54:58 but see I'm taking this to the macro level
00:55:00 because I don't even think it's just like
00:55:02 if you're a nihilist I don't think it makes
00:55:04 the most sense to just like or if you're a hedonist
00:55:06 just being really pleasured all the time yourself
00:55:08 I would argue is not actually
00:55:10 the most pleasure you can experience
00:55:12 I would argue that you're missing all kinds of stuff
00:55:14 that you can only expand maybe if we develop
00:55:16 high level artificial worlds
00:55:18 I'm back everybody, everyone stop the fucking presses
00:55:20 I'm back
00:55:22 I think I'm fucking
00:55:24 like the idea that you can't have
00:55:26 pleasure for like
00:55:28 if you have pleasure then you don't know
00:55:30 what pleasure is
00:55:32 and you have to have a bit of un-pleasure
00:55:34 I think this human brain
00:55:36 does that automatically
00:55:38 like I don't think
00:55:40 the human mind definitely
00:55:42 has a quick drop off of like if you accomplish
00:55:44 your life goal in a week
00:55:46 you're going to be bored of it you're going to want to do some other shit
00:55:48 like it's built to
00:55:50 like unless you're literally pumping yourself full of drugs
00:55:52 that's how it incentivizes progress
00:55:54 even then drugs lose their
00:55:56 effectiveness
00:55:58 happiness is a journey
00:56:00 happiness is not a destination because
00:56:02 if it's a destination you'll get there
00:56:04 and then you won't be happy anymore and the way to be happy
00:56:06 is to structure your life so that you always
00:56:08 have a goal to be working towards
00:56:10 that's what I believe
00:56:12 it will be great because we'll always be happy no matter what
00:56:14 there's no way you can ever be fully bored
00:56:16 you can just keep doing things
00:56:18 happiness is my penis
00:56:20 and see that's why
00:56:22 that is where this hedonism
00:56:24 and like humanism intersect
00:56:26 there is no reason to not
00:56:28 just act in a way to like maximize
00:56:30 pleasure in your life but it is not
00:56:32 maximizing pleasure in your life to just literally
00:56:34 go around like murdering people for fun
00:56:36 and then like
00:56:38 cause like that will your life will end very
00:56:40 quickly and unpleasantly if you just go around
00:56:42 doing that and then like doing drugs like
00:56:44 you'll die very soon you got to maximize
00:56:46 in the long term
00:56:48 not a lot of people want
00:56:50 then their pleasure is to do the things
00:56:52 that they want to do
00:56:54 in the case
00:56:56 they're being short-sighted
00:56:58 in the case that somebody likes murdering
00:57:00 it would be in their best interests
00:57:02 to just be really really smart
00:57:04 murder as many people as possible and never get caught
00:57:06 that's how they do that
00:57:08 what if murdering one person
00:57:10 would bring me more happiness
00:57:12 than the entire
00:57:14 lifetime of things that would
00:57:16 ever make me happy will
00:57:18 even if I got shot right after killing somebody
00:57:20 I would be
00:57:22 happier it would be more worthwhile
00:57:24 than having lived my whole life
00:57:26 there is no logical argument I can make to say that you shouldn't do that
00:57:28 but I don't think that's
00:57:30 very com-likely
00:57:32 and of course like this
00:57:34 and the other thing is like if this person
00:57:36 should keep in mind that like okay if everyone
00:57:38 acted like this society
00:57:40 would collapse and then you know other people
00:57:42 wouldn't have the opportunities to do these things
00:57:44 I doubt a murderer cares about Star Trek
00:57:46 why a murderer can still be logical
00:57:48 no no no we're talking about a logical murderer
00:57:50 who just understands this one thing about themselves
00:57:52 well here here's the thing I think
00:57:54 I think the fact that that can't happen
00:57:56 people are too scared to assume
00:57:58 that's what will happen like
00:58:00 if I kill this guy I'll never be as happy
00:58:02 as if I kill this guy they don't know that
00:58:04 for sure unless they're completely
00:58:06 insane and like you can't
00:58:08 have a logical person
00:58:10 decide to kill a person
00:58:12 that's not true because they don't know
00:58:14 what's in the future they may be like
00:58:16 well it's probably
00:58:18 it's like a bad gamble I'm not gonna take it
00:58:20 if I have a sister
00:58:22 and like she is getting like beaten up
00:58:24 terribly by like her boyfriend
00:58:26 and like she is like fully indoctrinated to think
00:58:28 that like oh no it's all okay but like
00:58:30 she's getting her worse and worse hurt and then like
00:58:32 it seems like like he's just gonna end up killing her one day
00:58:34 like he's got a jail work and she just will not leave him
00:58:36 there is a logical reason
00:58:38 to just go and kill this man
00:58:40 to like to kill him to like save someone
00:58:42 there is a reason to do that sort of thing
00:58:44 I don't know about it
00:58:46 but whatever she won't press charges
00:58:48 like it can't be done I'm talking about
00:58:50 a logical argument
00:58:52 I can construct a scenario
00:58:54 where murder is reasonable
00:58:56 correct
00:58:58 I'm just saying someone
00:59:00 whose pleasure is
00:59:02 the inherent destruction of society
00:59:04 by removing society from
00:59:06 being real because there are no more humans left
00:59:08 by killing people
00:59:10 I don't think he's too concerned
00:59:12 one two watch the world
00:59:14 bird there are clap emojis in between
00:59:16 all those words everybody
00:59:18 are we gonna move on to questions now
00:59:20 I've heard enough
00:59:22 I was in the middle of a point and you just memed all over me
00:59:24 go ahead
00:59:26 go ahead
00:59:28 I'm just saying I don't think those people
00:59:30 are too concerned about like the society ramifications
00:59:32 like if everyone did this then there would be no more
00:59:34 then they are short sighted
00:59:36 because no one else is
00:59:38 first of all that's not what is occurring
00:59:40 Nate's trying to argue about
00:59:42 like what is and is not like the most
00:59:44 like the most like consistent
00:59:46 logical system not about
00:59:48 like what people should actually
00:59:50 do or like what they will actually
00:59:52 like lead people to
00:59:54 like yeah this is not
00:59:56 totally logical I understand that
00:59:58 Nate's trying to argue for like in a perfect world
01:00:00 everyone would think this shit through and come to
01:00:02 like a well reasoned conclusion
01:00:04 right I guess
01:00:06 in a perfect world everyone would do the Macarena
01:00:08 at all times at the same time
01:00:10 everyone would do the Carmen
01:00:12 dance or however you smell it
01:00:14 it could cause million dance
01:00:16 yeah it would be like
01:00:18 you do the
01:00:20 you do the
01:00:22 yeah yeah
01:00:24 the one where it's like you put your
01:00:26 fucking hands up to your head and you do the
01:00:28 caramel dancing
01:00:30 that's how real smooth
01:00:36 I'm doing it right now
01:00:38 I'll do it
01:00:40 alright I've heard enough big words
01:00:42 and big converts
01:00:44 yeah anyone
01:00:46 it's a cool thing
01:00:48 it's true except for the ontological
01:00:50 except for the ontological
01:00:52 except for the ontological kind all the other
01:00:54 kinds are true there you go
01:00:56 my ending
01:00:58 statement on nihilism is that
01:01:00 now that you've heard us talk about it
01:01:02 there's no reason to ever put it in the comment section
01:01:04 so don't comment
01:01:06 my opinion is hashtag
01:01:08 real meetism join me
01:01:10 and believing that the only thing that matters
01:01:12 is that humans do
01:01:14 and I would say this is important to me
01:01:16 wait I'm a nihilist and a real meetist then
01:01:18 okay
01:01:20 I don't limit myself to just one box
01:01:22 yeah yeah yeah
01:01:24 I would say nihilism is true
01:01:26 but there is absolutely no reason you can't still
01:01:28 be a humanist and get some of that
01:01:30 hashtag weird utilitarianism going on in your life
01:01:32 so don't be afraid
01:01:34 I agree with literally everybody
01:01:36 okay everything they just said
01:01:38 all right
01:01:40 let's get to some questions
01:01:42 if you want to get your question read
01:01:44 donate to PCP patreon
01:01:46 you can go to the patreon lounge
01:01:48 where we talk to all of our bestest
01:01:50 fans
01:01:52 it's a discord chat
01:01:54 it's not a lounge
01:01:56 it's not actually the chas
01:01:58 well not yet at least
01:02:00 until we set everything up
01:02:02 and also
01:02:04 we read less of these these days
01:02:06 let's get on the off chance
01:02:08 submit one to the twitter
01:02:10 using hashtag askpcp
01:02:12 let's get our designated for question
01:02:14 out of the way
01:02:16 here's our infinity rise one
01:02:18 asks how do you find a motivation to live
01:02:20 if the goal that keeps you going
01:02:22 seems impossible
01:02:24 find a better goal
01:02:26 that's tough
01:02:28 if it seems to be
01:02:30 actually easy
01:02:32 does it seem impossible
01:02:34 because if it just seems impossible
01:02:36 but it is possible
01:02:38 don't stop
01:02:40 if it is actually impossible
01:02:42 then give up
01:02:44 imagine that
01:02:46 the thing is like a little like a bouncy toy
01:02:48 in front of you and then like get your magnifying glass
01:02:50 and like look at the individual atoms of it
01:02:52 and then pick apart all the atoms
01:02:54 one at a time and slowly after like a billion years
01:02:56 you will have all the atoms of that
01:02:58 spooky toy conquered
01:03:00 and I think what you're saying is
01:03:02 it's possible to break it down into the small components
01:03:04 exactly
01:03:06 I said it in a funnier way and I'm god basically
01:03:08 that's great
01:03:10 if you want to become like a beautiful
01:03:12 thesbian world renowned
01:03:14 like Kevin Spacey
01:03:16 my hero
01:03:18 then you know it might seem impossible
01:03:20 but if you really
01:03:22 bust your balls and do nothing but work towards it
01:03:24 for 20 years
01:03:26 maybe you'll get there might need some surgery
01:03:28 if you're ugly you might need all kinds of shit
01:03:30 well I would say that if your goal is to be
01:03:32 like
01:03:34 literally Kevin Spacey
01:03:36 then like you might never get there
01:03:38 but if you make a better goal
01:03:40 that's like oh I want to like
01:03:42 you know do the kind of things
01:03:44 that my hero Kevin Spacey does
01:03:46 then like you can start working towards that
01:03:48 and that's achievable
01:03:50 or if your goal is like
01:03:52 I want to become rich and famous
01:03:54 by the time I'm 25
01:03:56 it's like well
01:03:58 aim for the moon because even if you miss
01:04:00 you're going to fall to the ground
01:04:02 dead
01:04:04 maybe
01:04:06 from the patreon
01:04:08 I was about to ask maybe's question god damn it
01:04:10 fine do it fucking punk ass bitch
01:04:12 I already have a list
01:04:14 I wrote down the good ones
01:04:16 copy pasting them
01:04:18 anyway maybe asks
01:04:20 are you the type of person who can separate the actions
01:04:22 of an artist from their art itself
01:04:24 or does the artist's personal life
01:04:26 influence how you like their art
01:04:28 the first one
01:04:30 it depends
01:04:32 I wish I could separate it completely
01:04:34 but I really can't
01:04:36 I think that I used to be able
01:04:38 to separate it more but as I've come
01:04:40 like I've come to
01:04:42 I guess I've come to feel that like
01:04:44 art is
01:04:46 really just an extension of a person
01:04:48 and so I don't
01:04:50 think I really can anymore unfortunately
01:04:52 I can still appreciate things
01:04:54 but like I can't
01:04:56 I can't fully separate
01:04:58 in the one sense
01:05:00 I would like
01:05:02 I like the idea of just like enjoying art
01:05:04 like oh did you know
01:05:06 that that song you like was written by a
01:05:08 peter far like well I don't care
01:05:10 it's a good song but
01:05:12 I will like if there's a horrible person
01:05:14 that has made a thing
01:05:16 I will do a little bit
01:05:18 I still want to experience it because I like
01:05:20 the thing but you know I'll pirate it
01:05:22 I won't pay the money
01:05:24 for that thing
01:05:26 I'm not going to stop pirating Hitler artwork
01:05:28 I decorate my abode with it
01:05:30 exclusively but it's not about
01:05:32 Hitler
01:05:34 this isn't a Nazi thing what the fuck
01:05:36 leave me alone
01:05:38 I would say I don't I can't
01:05:40 necessarily separate them
01:05:42 but like I will still enjoy
01:05:44 and consume art by terrible
01:05:46 people if I think the art is good
01:05:48 the only time that I won't
01:05:50 is if it has to do with me
01:05:52 personally
01:05:54 because I'm in the kind of position where I've gotten into
01:05:56 fights with a lot of
01:05:58 artists and had people
01:06:00 say things such as a certain
01:06:02 my little pony musician who I was a really big
01:06:04 fan of for a time who said
01:06:06 don't listen to my music
01:06:08 ever again and anyone who
01:06:10 associates with Digi Bro don't talk
01:06:12 to me so this artist who I was
01:06:14 a really big fan of I cannot
01:06:16 listen to even though it's been a long
01:06:18 time now and now if I hear the songs
01:06:20 I'm like alright
01:06:22 you know I still appreciate
01:06:24 why I liked this back then
01:06:26 I probably wouldn't even get into it if I discovered it now
01:06:28 you know but like there's a few
01:06:30 artists like that and even on a lesser
01:06:32 scale like one that was
01:06:34 kind of a weird case is the
01:06:36 rapper Milo who
01:06:38 it's not that he did anything to me personally
01:06:40 but he has a real problem with white people
01:06:42 saying nigga and like
01:06:44 he's like always on about it
01:06:46 and I'm like
01:06:48 you know that you're basically
01:06:50 talking to me
01:06:52 he doesn't have a problem taking like white
01:06:54 people's money though when they buy his album
01:06:56 yeah well he'll complain about like white people saying it
01:06:58 at his shows and stuff and I'm like dude
01:07:00 you're saying it on your fucking album
01:07:02 how can we not say it at your shows
01:07:04 if that's the case I think it would be
01:07:06 more logically consistent to be like not okay
01:07:08 with them even listening to the music because
01:07:10 it's not for them in his mind it's like
01:07:12 for these people or whatever
01:07:14 the way I look at it is like there's no
01:07:16 like if I like the person who's making
01:07:18 it then I'll like the art there's like
01:07:20 and you know vice versa it's just
01:07:22 sort of like a modifier that I put on my
01:07:24 enjoyment of the art itself like I
01:07:26 consume like a comic and it's like
01:07:28 a good thing that I like but it's made
01:07:30 by a bad person that's not like an instant
01:07:32 well I don't like it anymore it's just like
01:07:34 like a debuff well and also
01:07:36 like minus 25%
01:07:38 sometimes I actually think the art can be
01:07:40 enhanced by that being a bad person
01:07:42 like I think so too very famously
01:07:44 like control I'll delete my favorite
01:07:46 webcomic well there's a black metal
01:07:48 band called Bersam which is just
01:07:50 a one-man band this guy Varg Vikerns
01:07:52 who in the early 90s
01:07:54 murdered the lead singer
01:07:56 of another black metal band mayhem
01:07:58 over a financial dispute
01:08:00 he stabbed him 37 times
01:08:02 and pushed him through a glass door
01:08:04 he was in prison
01:08:06 for like 15 years
01:08:08 in Norway and
01:08:10 he's out now but he's also like a hardcore
01:08:12 nationalist
01:08:14 and he's currently
01:08:16 he is currently a daily vlogger
01:08:18 by the way just by the by
01:08:20 this like 40 something year old
01:08:22 Xcon
01:08:24 murderer well black metal
01:08:26 superstar is now also
01:08:28 a daily vlogger
01:08:30 who talks about like nationalism and pagan stuff
01:08:32 and
01:08:34 pagan stuff yeah so and he lives
01:08:36 in the middle of the card he lives
01:08:38 like in the middle of nowhere in the woods
01:08:40 and he's like a huge spur lord
01:08:42 and he's got all these kids
01:08:44 and he lives on like a farm he's great
01:08:46 like in my opinion
01:08:48 the music is enhanced because
01:08:50 it's fucking black metal so like
01:08:52 I want it to be evil
01:08:54 and abrasive and wrong
01:08:56 you know like I want
01:08:58 to know that the guy who recorded this killed
01:09:00 a guy you know that makes it even
01:09:02 better that's that's
01:09:04 why Nate wants all this Hitler
01:09:06 all this all the all the paintings
01:09:08 like it enhances the aesthetic
01:09:10 experience I mean don't tell me that
01:09:12 having a Hitler painting would like not be
01:09:14 an amazing thing that would be so sick
01:09:16 that would be the sickest thing ever
01:09:18 that's literally why controversial things
01:09:20 are really funny yeah
01:09:22 because it's bad funny
01:09:24 right so I think I think for all of us the answer
01:09:26 I get a giggle every time I walk by my hitler portrait
01:09:28 it's very fucking funny
01:09:30 I think the answer for all of us is
01:09:32 like generally yes though
01:09:34 it like like it's not that we
01:09:36 separate it per se but just that we can enjoy
01:09:38 we can enjoy the content
01:09:40 without necessarily
01:09:42 contributing the the artists
01:09:44 like it plays a part in
01:09:46 our enjoyment I don't mean to harp on this
01:09:48 just it just decided I don't mean
01:09:50 to harp on this but like just just the Milo example
01:09:52 that did you brought up like I'm just thinking about that
01:09:54 like is it like okay
01:09:56 so obviously that guy like has is writing
01:09:58 music for like a specific group of people I like
01:10:00 but he's selling it to everybody
01:10:02 but like do you think if he could he would only
01:10:04 sell to black people or something
01:10:06 I mean on some level I think that might
01:10:08 be the case because he has made like
01:10:10 really exclusive tapes and stuff like that
01:10:12 but I mean I don't
01:10:14 think it's that I think a lot of it is more
01:10:16 that he's expressing that sentiment not
01:10:18 that it's like an absolute in his life
01:10:20 but he does express
01:10:22 like the sentiment in the lyrics of his songs
01:10:24 and sometimes it can feel like an attack
01:10:26 on me I just
01:10:28 get behind that at all that logic I just don't follow it
01:10:30 there's this one
01:10:32 thing that I
01:10:34 is like kind of relevant to this is
01:10:36 there's this TV show called the Great British
01:10:38 Bake Off where people bake is a competition
01:10:40 that is serious
01:10:42 do they get a baked as fuck dude
01:10:44 yeah
01:10:46 yes yes
01:10:48 trolololo
01:10:50 alright
01:10:52 this is a show
01:10:54 and it's great and the whole
01:10:56 nation loves it it used to be on BBC
01:10:58 and then the runners of the show
01:11:00 asked the BBC for more money because it was raking
01:11:02 in the viewers and the BBC said
01:11:04 ah no
01:11:06 so they left they just said fuck you we're going
01:11:08 to channel 4 instead
01:11:10 and people there was like a big hubbub
01:11:12 like channel 420 you know what I'm saying
01:11:14 trolololo
01:11:16 we can't don't
01:11:20 you're quite finished
01:11:22 I'm finished for now
01:11:24 okay
01:11:26 channel 4 and there was like a big hubbub
01:11:28 about like some of the presenters left and some of them stayed
01:11:30 and the show was great
01:11:32 it's still like exactly the same show
01:11:34 and I love it but people were like
01:11:36 oh I don't know whether I could
01:11:38 you know betray the BBC
01:11:40 and the presenters that I know and love to go
01:11:42 and watch the same show just on a different channel
01:11:44 like there was a
01:11:46 everyone was talking about it and I just didn't get
01:11:48 like and it's kind of the same sort of thing
01:11:50 like the artist
01:11:52 in this case is the producer of the show
01:11:54 like they said oh he did a bad thing
01:11:56 he left the BBC
01:11:58 and it's like
01:12:00 I don't know it's the same thing
01:12:02 too much
01:12:04 a lot of brand loyalism tied up in that
01:12:06 exactly
01:12:08 brand loyalism is the same
01:12:10 as artists separation
01:12:12 I don't even care if any of us try to answer this
01:12:14 I just want to read this because it's so badly written
01:12:16 it made me laugh
01:12:18 I think it's just an honest mistake
01:12:20 but Han Todd says
01:12:22 sandwich slash restaurant
01:12:24 if you have one
01:12:28 they got like good
01:12:30 good Philly cheesesteak sandwiches
01:12:32 Sub Jarrod at Subway
01:12:34 he's my man
01:12:36 sandwich sandwich
01:12:38 oh boy
01:12:40 a sandwich sandwich restaurant
01:12:42 a lot of little sandwiches
01:12:44 between two pieces of bread
01:12:46 and you're just biting into that motherfucker
01:12:48 alright
01:12:50 question
01:12:52 this one I'm interested in
01:12:54 because I think it could be different for everybody in here
01:12:56 plastic gargoyle
01:12:58 asks
01:13:00 do you guys often experience people acting as though
01:13:02 they're good friends with you based on their consumption
01:13:04 of your content
01:13:06 and what is your view on people treating consumption
01:13:08 for creators content as a sort of analog
01:13:10 for interacting with them
01:13:12 well I'll just jump in and say
01:13:14 that like I started
01:13:16 me and Jackie started a discord not that long ago
01:13:18 and it really took off
01:13:20 and it's like really really active
01:13:22 and I don't
01:13:24 I mean people would send me tweets and stuff
01:13:26 being like nice to me and I'd be nice to them
01:13:28 but like it was not like
01:13:30 friendship per se I don't know
01:13:32 but like I actually have become like pretty good friends
01:13:34 with a bunch of like these people in there
01:13:36 but would you say that was based on the consumption
01:13:38 like there's a difference
01:13:40 to me because I have the same thing
01:13:42 I also have a really active discord now
01:13:44 for my Patreon
01:13:46 when those people talk to me
01:13:48 like we're
01:13:50 I don't know they don't really act like we're all friends
01:13:52 but like it's okay for me
01:13:54 to me for them to like joke around
01:13:56 because we have been talking
01:13:58 like I know who they are
01:14:00 there has been in the past times where people
01:14:02 have come and been like
01:14:04 not really a whole lot
01:14:06 this isn't like a common occurrence but there have been times
01:14:08 where people were like buddy buddy with me
01:14:10 who I just don't know who they are
01:14:12 and I'm like uh do you
01:14:14 this happened a lot of brony con
01:14:16 when people used to follow us around and stuff
01:14:18 and be like real extra friendly when we were like
01:14:20 I literally do not know
01:14:22 who you are you know
01:14:24 yeah stuff like that sucks
01:14:26 but like I think really like when it comes to like
01:14:28 just talking on like on a discord
01:14:30 it's basically the same as
01:14:32 meeting new people except them knowing
01:14:34 your channel is just the icebreaker
01:14:36 and you don't have to do any of that
01:14:38 it is a great icebreaker and I will say
01:14:40 in spite of how I just made that sound at conventions
01:14:42 um
01:14:44 I don't mind so much when people come up
01:14:46 and like know a lot about me because I'm not surprised
01:14:48 because in many ways
01:14:50 it is pretty close to knowing me
01:14:52 like I put out so much content
01:14:54 and like express so much of my life
01:14:56 that like
01:14:58 the amount you I mean yeah there's
01:15:00 tons and tons of my life that you don't see
01:15:02 in the videos but a lot of that
01:15:04 life is reported on in the videos
01:15:06 you know so like if someone
01:15:08 came up to me and they were like up to date
01:15:10 going on with me that wouldn't surprise me
01:15:12 or be weird I'd just be like oh yeah
01:15:14 of course you know
01:15:16 I usually have a pretty easy time jumping
01:15:18 into in depth conversations with my
01:15:20 fans at cons at first meeting
01:15:22 like people I've never heard of but if they
01:15:24 come up and they're like oh I watch all your content
01:15:26 then we can just dive right into conversation
01:15:28 you know the worst thing
01:15:30 I mean I don't want to shit on anyone
01:15:32 so you know but this just does happen
01:15:34 is that
01:15:36 you know people come up to you and say hey
01:15:38 I really like your stuff or like in any
01:15:40 situation online or off
01:15:42 and you say oh thanks
01:15:44 and then they sort of like
01:15:46 feel like there's a rapport going
01:15:48 there's like a conversation and they expect you
01:15:50 to continue the conversation
01:15:52 when they used to have a light board of me
01:15:54 that kills me
01:15:56 I still like I've got a couple of discords
01:15:58 that I run and I will get messages
01:16:00 or like friend requests from individual
01:16:02 people and most people
01:16:04 you know actually to be fair
01:16:06 most people just know that like they shouldn't do that
01:16:08 this is actually pretty rare
01:16:10 I'm shocked how few friend requests
01:16:12 I've gotten from my discord
01:16:14 but I deny them all of course
01:16:16 I've got like hundreds of people in there
01:16:18 and I've only gotten like three or four friend requests
01:16:20 I know I scroll this back right now
01:16:22 I accept that shit man
01:16:24 you don't know anything about these people
01:16:26 yeah I do these are people that I've like talked to
01:16:28 some of them I would accept the request
01:16:30 from if they sent it but they haven't
01:16:32 but like you know
01:16:34 okay I'm looking I'm looking at
01:16:36 I got a message right here that I'm just looking
01:16:38 I'm not going to read it out loud
01:16:40 it's a tiny bit personal
01:16:42 but like I don't know who the fuck this person is
01:16:44 and this person is like wanting me
01:16:46 to like give them my time
01:16:48 like hey let's talk
01:16:50 who the fuck are you
01:16:52 I get that literally every day
01:16:54 and I don't
01:16:56 ever respond to them
01:16:58 but I don't know if that's the same thing as acting like my friend
01:17:00 it's more like the requesting to be my friend
01:17:02 alright stick with me here
01:17:04 but I consider this a form of violence
01:17:06 alright this is a form of violence
01:17:08 you are attacking me with a conversation
01:17:10 and you are
01:17:12 there's no way I cannot waste a little bit of my time
01:17:14 on dealing with this
01:17:16 you are stealing my time for me
01:17:18 even if it's just reading it
01:17:20 this is not a serious
01:17:22 I'm not seriously accusing anybody of this
01:17:24 that goes a little like
01:17:26 what this guy is asking about is more like
01:17:28 acting like they're already your friend
01:17:30 but that the idea of like
01:17:32 asking to be my friend
01:17:34 that happens all the time
01:17:36 and sometimes the phrasing of it
01:17:38 is super bizarre because it seems
01:17:40 to assume on their part that I would
01:17:42 be interested in them in some way
01:17:44 like when I got recently
01:17:46 and apologies if this guy happens to be listening
01:17:48 but it was strange
01:17:50 he said like what if we
01:17:52 met up some time he was like hey
01:17:54 I live in like a relatively near
01:17:56 area what if we met up some time
01:17:58 to see if we
01:18:00 like are as similar as I think
01:18:02 we are or something like that
01:18:04 and I'm like why would I want that
01:18:06 like who would ever want to hang out with someone
01:18:08 similar to Digi bro that's just
01:18:10 I mean I just
01:18:12 why do like I'm not out in the market
01:18:14 for like new friends right now
01:18:16 like it's not something I'm like
01:18:18 like the idea that somebody might be similar to me
01:18:20 but he is Digi so fuck what you want
01:18:22 like fuck what you want
01:18:24 I've got the reason I have
01:18:26 what becoming a friend
01:18:28 with someone is like I have a discord too
01:18:30 I think we all have discords
01:18:32 on my discord it feels more like
01:18:34 that I am just one of the other people
01:18:36 in the discord and like people post
01:18:38 things and talk about things and then I comment
01:18:40 on them and I say silly things
01:18:42 they say silly things it's just sort of like
01:18:44 I'm a community with
01:18:46 my community and that's like the best
01:18:48 situation I'm not like a figurehead
01:18:50 I am both a figurehead and that
01:18:52 in mine like because
01:18:54 I have a whole channel of just discussing my content
01:18:56 and my content comes out all the time
01:18:58 there's definitely a level of deference
01:19:00 towards me in there but like
01:19:02 to me the reason I
01:19:04 have a big audience is that there's
01:19:06 plenty of people like me
01:19:08 you know like there's plenty of people who are similar
01:19:10 enough to me that we can have a conversation
01:19:12 so let's have a conversation here
01:19:14 online that's what the internet's for
01:19:16 you meet people who are kind of like
01:19:18 you and you have some conversations
01:19:20 like not every person who's anything
01:19:22 like me is gonna make me be like
01:19:24 oh well we gotta be best friends
01:19:26 yeah and then like miraculously if you
01:19:28 end up talking to someone and you just like are clicking
01:19:30 and it's just like then like okay you know what
01:19:32 we're hooking up let's let's do something on our
01:19:34 own but I mean that was us basically
01:19:36 that's exactly we are that that's correct that's correct
01:19:38 so see that's that's how it happens it's gotta be
01:19:40 a natural thing guys don't don't fucking friend
01:19:42 me if we have not had a conversation just
01:19:44 don't do it munchie did you have any
01:19:46 you wanted to read out of this chat
01:19:48 before I get to I only have one more but it's
01:19:50 uh I don't know
01:19:52 alright I'll just like I'll do it
01:19:54 just fucking whatever munchie do you
01:19:56 real real quick just want to like delete
01:19:58 yourself from the PCP real quick
01:20:00 yeah I'm just I'm just go ahead and
01:20:02 remove myself from all future endeavors
01:20:04 I'm just gonna Leon Trotsky
01:20:06 myself and fucking remove myself from
01:20:08 all so all the podcast
01:20:10 I'm just gonna delete them all they're all gonna be gone
01:20:12 just put a high-pitched
01:20:14 wine over all of your speech seconds
01:20:16 in all the PCP so far okay
01:20:18 it'll be like Marvel
01:20:20 it's like slender man like
01:20:22 like
01:20:24 like slender man is near you
01:20:26 you'll get sickness oh that sounds good
01:20:28 we should make a let's literally make a channel
01:20:30 that's called PCP minus munchie
01:20:32 where we do that we just upload all the content
01:20:34 there are people who would like to be
01:20:36 really thankful for that
01:20:38 and I fucking think that they should
01:20:40 they should all get the fuck out of here
01:20:42 we should make a channel called
01:20:44 just munchie
01:20:46 we should make a channel
01:20:48 that's like PCP plus
01:20:50 Marvel Hornets where we just all
01:20:52 we just is Marvel Hornets but all of us are the different characters
01:20:54 we should make a show we should make a show where munchie
01:20:56 just literally bitches about my little pony
01:20:58 content creators for like dozens of hours
01:21:00 oh my god can you imagine
01:21:02 we should just make a show
01:21:04 where we read a homestuck
01:21:06 week by week and then move through
01:21:08 weekly munchie don't you ever
01:21:10 fucking say that again munchie do not even
01:21:12 speak of such an idea I don't want to hear about it
01:21:14 alright alright here's one
01:21:16 that I'm just going to answer really fast
01:21:18 HappyD asks
01:21:20 does slash will the PCP have a cap
01:21:22 on the number of members yes
01:21:24 the cap is the current number and it will never
01:21:26 exceed this number again
01:21:28 ever there is no
01:21:30 reason it should or will ever
01:21:32 happen you know honestly
01:21:34 unless it's really festive
01:21:36 unless it's really really festive like the mild point
01:21:38 oh it's like a you know in an
01:21:40 rpgs how you get like temporary party members
01:21:42 who join just like the specific dungeon or something
01:21:44 yeah maybe maybe a little
01:21:46 yeah there might be some guests but there's no
01:21:48 there will be another core
01:21:50 member of the PCP again
01:21:52 the number is going the number is only going
01:21:54 down from here guys
01:21:56 we're cutting corners
01:21:58 I'm going to replace myself with Father Christmas
01:22:00 I thought they meant like
01:22:02 how many people are on each podcast like the limit
01:22:04 to what they can record but I have no idea
01:22:06 why would they mint that that no yeah
01:22:08 yeah no that's already the case
01:22:10 okay okay
01:22:12 just theoretically
01:22:14 it's possible but just imagine the gauntlet
01:22:16 that the next person who's like a viable candidate
01:22:18 to join will have to go to like the years
01:22:20 the years of training
01:22:22 the only way another person's going to join
01:22:24 is if it is a case like Munchie
01:22:26 where literally all of us have known
01:22:28 and been friends with them for like three years
01:22:30 and he had to prove his
01:22:32 worth you know like
01:22:34 investigator was everything I hoped
01:22:36 it would be
01:22:38 change the game
01:22:40 he proved his worth
01:22:42 with the lecture
01:22:44 the parkour 291 lecture
01:22:46 there's no doubt
01:22:48 alright one last question
01:22:50 no digit asks how would you optimize the PCP
01:22:52 delete Munchie
01:22:54 yeah
01:22:56 and it's good
01:22:58 the PCP is a chaotic
01:23:00 blip in the system
01:23:02 optimizing it would mean smoothing out the whole thing
01:23:04 like smoothing out the wrinkles on the brain
01:23:06 exactly oh my god
01:23:08 yeah we don't want to be optimized we'll be deleted
01:23:10 we will be removed
01:23:12 I think if I was going to optimize the PCP
01:23:14 obviously get everybody
01:23:16 in one place
01:23:18 which is what we already want to do
01:23:20 once I'm in a room never just eat the key
01:23:22 I think it would be
01:23:24 easier for us to if we wanted
01:23:26 to talk about like more topical stuff
01:23:28 on the PCP it would be easier
01:23:30 if we could all consume it together
01:23:32 you know that's true like if we all lived in one place
01:23:34 it'd be easy enough for us to all like
01:23:36 go see a movie
01:23:38 that just came out and then do a PCP on it
01:23:40 right after this
01:23:42 that would be pretty sick
01:23:44 imagine the reputation
01:23:46 that our gang would acquire at the local
01:23:48 cinema place
01:23:50 oh my god
01:23:52 the PCB boys
01:23:54 are rolling through again everybody
01:23:56 put your park is on
01:23:58 there's about to be a jizz hurricane
01:24:00 we would be ruffians
01:24:02 we would be ruffians
01:24:04 I think we're at
01:24:06 we're at a
01:24:08 point where we're probably like
01:24:10 five or six months out from PCP
01:24:12 headquarters starting to become a thing
01:24:14 we're getting close
01:24:16 and I think it's
01:24:18 perfect timing because we can only
01:24:20 stretch random ass
01:24:22 weird esoteric concepts so far
01:24:24 like as you saw this episode
01:24:26 nihilism
01:24:28 like this is a weird topic
01:24:30 and you can only do so many
01:24:32 nihilism podcasts
01:24:34 you can only have so many
01:24:36 you can only have so many podcasts that spiral straight
01:24:38 to weird utilitarianism
01:24:40 immediately and go there forever
01:24:42 all roads lead back to weird utilitarianism
01:24:44 this is clear
01:24:46 it's the rock upon which the PCP
01:24:48 rests
01:24:50 from the beginning of the PCP I think we've been saying
01:24:52 we need to have more specific media casts
01:24:54 but there's nothing that all of us consume
01:24:56 guaranteed enough
01:24:58 that the rikstie minutes will pop up
01:25:00 or Dark Souls 3
01:25:02 rikstie minutes is the worst thing on this channel
01:25:04 it's even worse than Armour Tree
01:25:06 rikstie minutes was like
01:25:08 significantly more popular than the PCP for its time
01:25:10 which was interesting
01:25:12 Armour Tree was been out forever bro
01:25:14 there's only one episode on this channel
01:25:16 that's what I was saying
01:25:18 the special
01:25:20 I just want to read out this real quick
01:25:22 this is just for me no one else can answer
01:25:24 extra Pharisees if you could insert yourself into a movie
01:25:26 that movie in Y
01:25:28 a chindler's list
01:25:30 but what?
01:25:32 as in what?
01:25:34 only the Germans
01:25:36 is the protagonist that guy who played Voldemort
01:25:38 who was the leader of the Nazi camp
01:25:40 that's who I always empathize with
01:25:42 it's really sad that he lost
01:25:44 I actually want to ask this question
01:25:46 I don't think this is a good question
01:25:48 but I could be wrong
01:25:50 because either this guy's a weirdo
01:25:52 or there's more weirdos out there
01:25:54 Pondedator2 asks
01:25:56 how often do you think about speedrunning
01:25:58 while you're playing a game
01:26:00 for me it's pretty much constantly
01:26:02 to the point that I almost can't think about games
01:26:04 in other ways
01:26:06 well that's fun
01:26:08 is this the first time you play through a game?
01:26:10 I mean I will say that
01:26:12 occasionally when I'm playing a game
01:26:14 if I see something
01:26:16 that looks like
01:26:18 something a speedrunner would use
01:26:20 I would say oh that's obviously the speedrun tech
01:26:22 like maybe once in a blue run
01:26:24 that happens
01:26:26 like every so often
01:26:28 I think of a game and I'm like wait
01:26:30 have I seen a speedrun of that game
01:26:32 but that's like months or years after I played it
01:26:34 I don't think about it at the time
01:26:36 the fact that
01:26:38 I am in the
01:26:40 I'm in the midst of people
01:26:42 who like speedrunning
01:26:44 more than they like esports
01:26:46 genuinely sickens me and ever since
01:26:48 I've never been able to forgive any of you
01:26:50 that's my opinion
01:26:52 I don't know that I like speedrunning
01:26:54 more than esports
01:26:56 esports is just a lot harder to get into and follow
01:26:58 I like speedrunning
01:27:00 like a speedrun you just throw on a youtube video
01:27:02 esports you have to like
01:27:04 watch cool ass matches bro
01:27:06 I don't even know where one matches
01:27:08 watches a match of esports
01:27:10 you fucking google it
01:27:12 how do I know what matches are interesting
01:27:14 you're good
01:27:16 you got research
01:27:18 you fucking watch Melee
01:27:20 any day of your life
01:27:22 just move Melee to Melee
01:27:24 top 10 tournament
01:27:26 I know Melee esports
01:27:28 the last one I remember though
01:27:30 is Hungrybox beating Armada with Jigglypuff
01:27:32 and after that I felt like Melee's over now
01:27:34 like we've done all we needed to
01:27:36 that was all I wanted to happen
01:27:38 and it happened and now Melee's over
01:27:40 my friends back since college
01:27:42 have been into the competitive league of legends
01:27:44 scene just like following the
01:27:46 the past
01:27:48 disgusting
01:27:50 I have never understood the appeal
01:27:52 I have not once understood
01:27:54 I get the appeal I'm just not interested
01:27:56 leg of leg
01:27:58 there was a brief period where I was subscribed
01:28:00 to Thorin
01:28:02 the guy who's like a
01:28:04 esports commentator guy
01:28:06 not a commentator but he makes videos about esports
01:28:08 and all of his like broad concept
01:28:10 videos explaining why esports
01:28:12 are interesting were really cool
01:28:14 and good but then he would like
01:28:16 have like a video a day
01:28:18 about actual esports and like
01:28:20 they're all written in such a way
01:28:22 that you need to know an incredible amount
01:28:24 of information to get in
01:28:26 like it's oh fucking
01:28:28 sorry I was interrupting
01:28:30 no it's just like I
01:28:32 I don't even know the rules
01:28:34 of the games that are being talked about
01:28:36 enough to like much less
01:28:38 the meta or the tech or the people
01:28:40 you know like I'd have to
01:28:42 like the only reason I know smash
01:28:44 melee is because I watched that
01:28:46 fucking four hour documentary about it
01:28:48 and even that is considered like
01:28:50 entry level you know
01:28:52 sure it's cool
01:28:54 fucking Sal TV
01:28:56 a TF2
01:28:58 commentator esports guy I love
01:29:00 that shit I love esports
01:29:02 fuck you
01:29:04 on this guy's question
01:29:06 on the guy's question of
01:29:08 speedrunning I'm playing a lot
01:29:10 right now of
01:29:12 of world renowned game
01:29:14 for the Nintendo Switch Mario Odyssey
01:29:16 that literally everyone agrees is a beautiful
01:29:18 masterpiece with no attractive flaws
01:29:20 of any kind
01:29:22 and I do like I'm always
01:29:24 playing that game to like optimize speed
01:29:26 and I have actually researched like
01:29:28 the optimal ways to place for like maximum
01:29:30 height on jumps to like get to secret places
01:29:32 and stuff and like there's a lot of races
01:29:34 to do in the game so like I sort of
01:29:36 think I know what he's talking about but
01:29:38 I don't know it sounds like he's taking it to a higher level
01:29:40 our Italians
01:29:42 I just think it's weird that
01:29:44 he would ask that question
01:29:46 like clearly he's a
01:29:48 speedrun guy
01:29:50 like clearly he has a deep interest
01:29:52 in speedrun so he thinks that way
01:29:54 why would he expect anybody who
01:29:56 doesn't speedrun constantly
01:29:58 to think that way he knows none of us are speedrunners
01:30:00 if he watches the PCP
01:30:02 well we have done the races which is more than most people
01:30:04 have done but like in all of those
01:30:06 we make it very clear that this was like
01:30:08 an intensively researched project
01:30:10 for this one video
01:30:12 you know that's true
01:30:14 I don't think any of us has ever given the impression that we are speedrunners
01:30:16 oh
01:30:18 someone asked me a question directly
01:30:20 they even added me don't do that but thank you
01:30:22 and I just have to do this out of the kindness of my heart
01:30:24 how many hats can you fill in your head
01:30:26 depends on their size
01:30:28 depends on the size of
01:30:30 Munchie's head that day
01:30:32 yeah yeah yeah
01:30:34 how many hats have
01:30:36 you had on your head at once
01:30:38 and I have put four on my
01:30:40 like actual hats
01:30:42 not joke hats
01:30:44 well wait
01:30:46 wait what's a cap
01:30:48 what does that mean
01:30:50 I didn't say cap I said joke hat
01:30:52 oh I have six
01:30:54 I've had six hats on my head
01:30:56 are you stacking them on top of each other
01:30:58 cause that's easy I'm talking about next to each other
01:31:00 on your head to create a full half sphere
01:31:02 on the top of your head
01:31:04 can you get more than two
01:31:06 I've done three
01:31:08 and they've all been real tiny hats
