00:00:00 Ah, fancy meeting you here. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy
00:00:10 ever. And let's see who we got here. We've got Gibbontake. There you go. In and out. We've
00:00:18 got Ben Saint. Yes, technically correct. Accurate. That's the best kind of correct. Tom Oliver.
00:00:28 I did it. I'm here. I made it. Just in time. Just in the nick of time. Nobody's ready for
00:00:36 breakfast. Mage, what's up? Apple's motherfucker. And that's it. And that's the last one. Apple.
00:00:46 It's like that Apple Pokemon. Like I do like them apples. I mean, I'd rather... Oh, you
00:00:51 know what? I love oranges. There was a big debate about oranges versus apples the other
00:00:55 day, but I gotta tell you, oranges, apples, they're dodging. Let's not revisit the juice,
00:01:00 debacle. What the hell happened? Let me just tell you, the best thing, one word, grapefruit.
00:01:07 Grapefruit is the greatest fruit on the planet. You're right. And no one appreciates it. Nobody
00:01:13 appreciates grapefruit. Literally no one else in the entire world likes grapefruit but me.
00:01:18 What the fuck? Don't be one of these hoity-toity motherfuckers with your grapefruit scissor
00:01:22 and your spoon, putting sugar on it. Yes, that makes it like a fucking bowl of sweet
00:01:26 cereal. No, you peel it like an orange. That's so fucking yucky. That's so fucking gross
00:01:31 that people will put my fucking juice. Yeah, like a grapefruit's fucking sweet already,
00:01:36 you fucking coward. It stinks of the bourgeoisie and I'll have none of it. It's something fucked
00:01:42 up's going on here. If you're like, sugar would add something. Pure sugar would add something
00:01:47 to this experience. I fucking hate sugar in most foods. I feel like sugar is like to
00:01:56 have like sweet chili or like sweet and sour food, like sugar in like a savory food, like
00:02:04 a main course. It just feels wrong. I hate barbecue sauce. It's disgusting. No, I don't
00:02:10 agree with that. I read a recipe. It's the worst fucking shit in the world. I read a
00:02:14 recipe on r slash keto recipes. That was for crustless keto pizza. Funny thing about this
00:02:20 pizza is that you just fucking put cheese on a pan and bake it and the cheese just becomes
00:02:26 the crust. It's really funny. You know, that's like a weird take on the fact that... Just
00:02:32 get rid of the middle man. You're only there for the sauce and cheese anyway. That's all
00:02:35 you really want. Yeah, it's like if you don't do this complicated thing where you use all
00:02:38 these alternate almond flour for the crust, call it... No, just no crust. Cheese on the
00:02:42 pan. Just bake the cheese. Just eat the cheese. But then this guy, who was like, if you want
00:02:48 to do like a fancy sort of sweet pizza, sprinkle a little stevia on top of the crust. Oh yeah,
00:02:54 stevia. What the fuck? I don't get that. Like are you fucking kidding me? Who on this fucking
00:02:59 God's green earth has sweet pizza? That sounds like a nightmare. I mean, I understand like
00:03:06 Hawaiian pizza has pineapple on it. That's not my thing, but like I get it in concept.
00:03:11 But to just take like some fucking like sugar substitute and just sprinkle it on top of your
00:03:16 pizza, you must be fucking high, bro. I mean, what's wrong with you? Some places have like
00:03:22 cinnamon breadsticks. You can get like, and they're very similar to like the normal garlic.
00:03:26 It's like that just is the crust of the pizza. But we're not talking about making a cinnamon
00:03:29 pizza or like a dessert pizza. This is just a regular pizza made with like cheese and
00:03:33 fucking pepperoni. Just sprinkle some sugar on top. No. Yeah, the combination. The combination
00:03:39 of sugar and savory is what annoys me the most. Like I love desserts. Everyone can enjoy
00:03:43 a good dessert. But like having a sweet thing in something that is otherwise savory really
00:03:49 annoys me. I turned my nose up. I'm a savory boy. I'm a spicy boy. I'm a savory spicy
00:03:56 boy. You're being very elitist right now. That's all. Guys. What? Have you ever had chocolate
00:04:03 pizza? That sounds just like a pancake. I've had like Domino's. I've had like the like
00:04:09 dessert pizza, which is just like an Oreo fucking frosting thing. I had a chocolate ice
00:04:16 cream sandwich where I just got two slices of white bread and put chocolate ice cream
00:04:20 in the middle. It's actually really good. Bread goes well with it. I had I had chocolate
00:04:24 pizza for Mazda and it sucks and I'll never have a chocolate pizza again. There's this
00:04:29 place nearby that looks like the Buskin Baker or something. They have a food truck outside
00:04:33 that is it's like ice cream donuts and they have they have like these they give you a
00:04:38 warm like freshly cut donuts. They cut it in half and in between they put like a layer
00:04:42 of like pizza. I think I had like raspberry ice cream. It was fine. It was okay. Oh damn
00:04:49 and ice cream and I was not overly impressed. Sounds all right. Yeah. I also made another
00:04:54 recipe from r slash keto recipes. I made keto brownies and I don't know what the fuck is
00:04:59 wrong with them. All right. I don't know. It said it said use xylitol. Use erythritol.
00:05:05 Don't use stevia. I don't understand why you can't make this in the fucking lab and concocting
00:05:10 with magic spells and tinctures. I don't know why you wouldn't be able to use stevia if it's
00:05:15 like it's just as sweet if users are but apparently but I use so I was like that's stupid. I made
00:05:20 it. I used stevia and it's not sweet. It's fucking these brownies are the textures mediocre.
00:05:27 The flavor is fucking like bitter. They're awful. But I can't throw them out because
00:05:31 they're made of fucking butter and almond flour which is too precious and I can't waste it.
00:05:35 So I have to I'm still shocked to this day by the fact that when you like when you what's
00:05:40 the word cook. I don't know when you fry onions they turn sweet which is which is truly stupendous.
00:05:46 I guess so. I guess so but I don't know. I guess I fucked up. I guess I did it wrong.
00:05:51 My brownies are terrible. They're they're a nightmare. Well that's so I took the pizza
00:05:56 idea and I sprinkled stevia on top of them and I don't know. It's a little better. Hey
00:06:04 here's a fact. Here's a fact that makes me mad. The main ingredient in stevia the zero
00:06:08 calorie sweetener that's not sugar. Do you know what the first ingredient is bread dextrose
00:06:14 it's sugar. But they remove all the bad strokes and they only leave the decks. Wrong. You're
00:06:21 super speedy. They just use they just use little enough of it that according to the
00:06:25 round serving size which is like a one packet's worth it's under five calories worth so they're
00:06:31 allowed to claim that it's zero. In fact it is. It is almost as bad as this regular sugar.
00:06:36 Don't use the powdered kind. Is it just like the percentage that like they have a large
00:06:40 percentage of nothing on top of the sugar. So it's not it's not even that large but yeah
00:06:46 some of it is just it's just got like bulk ingredients that just like bulk it up and
00:06:49 don't add anything. So what's the difference between the liquid and the sugar. Liquid doesn't
00:06:55 have the bulk. The stevia the stevia liquid is just like the extract from the plant which
00:07:00 you know. Okay. My my friend bought a stevia plant and you can actually like pluck a leaf
00:07:05 off a stevia plant and chew it and you can taste like a sweetness like as though it's
00:07:09 got sugar in it because it just has like a naturally sweet like fucking I don't know
00:07:13 oil or essence or something in it or whatever the fuck. Makes sense. You can just put stevia
00:07:17 leaves in your tea when you're fucking cooking your tea or whatever and it'll sweeten your
00:07:21 tea. Isn't that interesting. I'm interesting. I just thought that was interesting. Yeah that
00:07:27 people die in car crashes all the time. Speaking of things that are interesting. Let's get this
00:07:33 out of the way right now. In fact the Pokemon is out. Right. Okay. There you go. It's out.
00:07:38 Me and Major played it. It's you know. Here's my one minute run down. Wait. Wait. Are you
00:07:44 going to talk about it on content in like a week or two. I think. Okay. I'll close my ears for
00:07:52 now. I don't want to get spoiled on Nate's opinion. You know. Oh okay. Sure. Sure. I will
00:07:58 surely not go into full detail here but here in brief. It's pretty good. It's not like awful.
00:08:05 I kind of feel like I feel bad a little bit because I felt I feel too like I was kind of
00:08:10 swept up into like wow looks like this game is total shit for reasons I I don't know like there
00:08:16 are technical limitations that do annoy me as I play when I just like actually I mean one of the
00:08:22 annoying the only technical thing that's bothered me so far is that the like render distance of
00:08:27 enemies is of people in the field is very short and you can see them pop invisibly and it like
00:08:32 makes the world feel way less real which is unfortunate but that's that's a technical thing
00:08:38 that you know it's not like they wanted to do that so it's overall when you mean a technical
00:08:44 thing you mean they fucking couldn't do that on to on current hardware I mean there's no way they
00:08:49 like wanted to do that I'm assuming that was a concession for you know I mean it doesn't even
00:08:54 look that frame rates that like in graphically intensive it looks like a fucking ps3 game well
00:08:59 I mean what's the argument here they like they chose to do this for whatever engine to make the
00:09:04 game whatever engine they've designed was not optimized it's not a well optimized yeah okay
00:09:10 criticism for that but like all this all the oh my god it's like the worst game ever it's like it
00:09:15 doesn't bother me that much no it's not the worst game ever it's just technically unimpressive okay I
00:09:20 don't mean to lump your points in now with the the group anger that I was just like because like I
00:09:26 I have seen a few clips here and there I clicked on an arlo video for like five minutes because he
00:09:30 was talking about it and was like yeah what do you think what are you talking about models models
00:09:34 are the same okay there's controversy whatever it's pokemon well that's the worst like the game the
00:09:40 game just looked sort of like yeah yeah the game it looks like a ds game but on on a bigger screen
00:09:47 the field looks kind of neat the the only someone was telling me on twitter that the field is really
00:09:51 cool the the only thing about the game that I don't think is either a lateral move or shit is the
00:09:57 field um how do you what do you think about the field the fact that pokemon are physically
00:10:03 visible in the field and you run up and hit them I think is a is we have low expectations for pokemon
00:10:09 right but considering that it's a massive jump up it's a it's way better than it used to they already
00:10:14 did it in in this is this is like the closest this is the closest they've ever gotten to a pokemon
00:10:20 mmo and I've always wanted a pokemon mmo so they are they are wow wow we almost got what we wanted
00:10:26 cool um they already did they already did that in um Pikachu Eevee whatever the fuck well I'm
00:10:34 glad they beta tested it in that game for this one the real one I'm sure I'm talking about like
00:10:40 max raids and stuff that's the mmo thing uh because you you you get with friends and you
00:10:47 battle giant pokemon that's I don't care about that at all you haven't tried you don't know you
00:10:51 don't know the joys I've done a couple I mean what I hate organizing things with people I just want
00:10:56 to go do it so you get a bunch on my own so you can like specifically join up with your friends and
00:11:01 the people you want to play with I think so or do you just get randomly cued um you're cutting out
00:11:08 I think you can do either I believe is how it works I'm saying do you get randomly cued and grouped
00:11:12 up with random people or can you be like I want to raid with this guy like my friend I want to
00:11:18 raid with my friends um if you if you have friends uh and you say like a far far fetched possibility
00:11:26 but people can can join uh you quickly but other but but but strangers can join too so you can so
00:11:34 you can choose to do it with your friends if you want to yeah but like I mean okay that's all fine I
00:11:39 appreciate that you're in the past how they do it because I can't I can't go into the uh I can't
00:11:44 I can't cook curry with my friends it's very troublesome uh to to get sort of things I don't
00:11:50 care about at all I I only care about the like main playthrough of the game and then like the
00:11:56 larger meta game uh of like people the I don't do competitive fighting like at all but I am very
00:12:03 disturbed by the fact that so many pokemon and moves are removed which will impact like the
00:12:08 overall scene because I like watching false swipe gaming's review of you know how a pokemon did
00:12:15 through all the ages that's my main connection I haven't I have I have a lot to catch up on
00:12:19 but that guy makes a lot it makes a lot over there uh well there's a lot there's a lot of pokemon
00:12:25 to get through this is a lot of pokemon not as many as there would have been can't wait for 20 20
00:12:30 the year is 2036 and it comes out how was Eternatus competitively really I honestly
00:12:36 am very excited for that video one day I can't wait but uh okay in short this game is a pretty
00:12:44 okay game it's actually better than sun and moon I think I was gonna I was gonna say how to use the
00:12:48 compared to sun and moon the fact that there's no sun and moon all pokemon aren't in is such a
00:12:54 massive blow it's it's traumatic and it's very distressing they might extremely maybe that maybe
00:13:00 when they do the ultra maybe when they do ultra sword and shield they'll fix that I hope so I
00:13:07 because like it's obviously just because it's obviously like a fake a fake limit that they just
00:13:12 made out I heard I heard a rumor why the limit actually exists if anyone cares to hear okay so
00:13:18 like they originally wanted to import the models from like sun and moon and and you know update them
00:13:24 what not for for this game but they realized too late uh that like uh whatever they were using to
00:13:31 import models uh failed so they had to recreate the models from scratch to make them like identical
00:13:38 and uh they ran out of time and instead it wasn't gonna let them extend the deadlines so they had
00:13:43 to definitely definitely I am sympathetic I am sympathetic you know I don't know maybe that
00:13:49 yeah they're gonna they're gonna recreate they made every they made fucking 700 pokemon models
00:13:54 for the last gen and they're just like whoops can't use them gotta make them again no well
00:14:01 I mean as the as the only person here who does any 3d at all I can say that is that sounds patently
00:14:08 retarded to me even to someone with like baby level 3d like there's no like there there are it's like
00:14:13 saying oh I started making this game and I realized all these jpegs I made won't import into this
00:14:19 engine it's like it's a fucking jpeg there are 3d equivalents from that export it as an fbx and
00:14:23 import it into literally whatever you're using like nintendo is assumedly like game freak has
00:14:28 probably made their own proprietary game engine to make this game so like they would know what works
00:14:35 with it like it's their engine well okay there's no way you can't just export a model and import it
00:14:42 in just because like not only is is there just like standards for models like an fbx and shit like
00:14:47 that but like these models in the game have identical geometry and there's no way you can
00:14:53 recreate a model with literally identical geometry it can be similar you can have like
00:14:58 basically the same topology you know it's not gonna be identical it's like saying that was brought
00:15:03 up and arlo talked about in his video briefly about like the models are literally the same
00:15:07 okay like that seemed to be based on I didn't do further research that seemed to be based on
00:15:11 the fact that they put up like the mesh models of characters from like sun and moon versus in this
00:15:16 game and they visually look the same to us but I mean I didn't see any kind of like technical
00:15:20 explanation that proved that these weren't recreate well you can just look at them and see that they're
00:15:26 all identical wouldn't it make sense if they recreated they'd look really really similar
00:15:30 because they're the same no they would never they would never look identical all of them no
00:15:35 creating a 3d model it's not real life creating a 3d model is not like like you don't type in a
00:15:42 bunch of code and it just makes all the points you have to draw it basically in 3d it's like it's
00:15:47 like saying you draw like a like a picture on like a piece of paper and then you try to draw the
00:15:52 exact same thing it will never look exactly the same right exactly I don't believe you okay well
00:15:57 I've done it if you could just copy paste if you could just fucking copy paste the code to have it
00:16:03 identical that's the same thing as just importing it from this from the last generation like I can
00:16:07 believe guys if they're saying like the reason the models are they had to redo the models was like
00:16:13 they had to redo the texturing because they've went from like a qvga display on the 3ds to a 720p
00:16:20 display on the switch and the textures were too low resolution they had to redo them because they
00:16:24 did they redid the textures and they redid the shaders because the shaders and the textures
00:16:28 are higher resolution and look different that's one thing but they definitely from what it looks
00:16:33 like and we're gonna know soon because like now that the game's out people are going to be able to
00:16:36 start ripping all the models from it and do like point for point comparisons but like the models
00:16:41 the geometry like when people are talking about models we're usually talking about the geometry
00:16:45 not the textures and the mapping data the geometry looks completely identical as it was also identical
00:16:53 in let's go Pikachu to the 3ds models because Game Freak themselves had said we're going to use
00:16:59 these models long term that's why we made them as good as we did on the 3ds and why we're running
00:17:03 its performance issues because they're gonna be forward they're forward-facing and then a couple
00:17:07 years later uh we forgot how our own engine works we can't import standard models back into our engine
00:17:13 I agree I agree guys here's the thing like maybe I'd perhaps be willing to hear some of these excuses
00:17:18 but here's the thing it doesn't matter because I'm totally 100% with you I don't care what happened
00:17:24 to them in development I have no interest because the as the kind of person I am playing these games
00:17:30 my number one most important issue for me playing these games is this is top priority get all the
00:17:36 Pokemon okay I don't care that is great that is completely fine and if you were arguing that
00:17:42 point I'd be like fine but you're not arguing that point you're saying I don't believe you and
00:17:47 saying I don't believe you is different than saying I don't care so say I don't care from the start
00:17:52 and we can skip 20 minutes I still don't believe you that it's not possible to recreate a 3d model
00:17:57 no that is fucking impossible to do it identically if you overlay the points you know that you know
00:18:03 that artists make these models right not just like programmers like it's not just about like
00:18:07 punching numbers into a code look we've we can see what the models look we see the mesh why couldn't
00:18:13 you just use that image and like recreate it you can image it's not an it's not a 2d image it's a
00:18:18 3d model that was created by a fucking 3d render modeling artist or whatever the fuck you call him
00:18:24 like someone like like like someone created it someone someone made all the creative decisions
00:18:29 involved in like how does it move where the joints place what is the fucking geometry I'm just
00:18:34 considering all the like versions of these Pokemon that have existed throughout time I just have a
00:18:38 tough time different in every generation uh you slightly yeah I yeah I have no idea how you can
00:18:45 like you yeah you're talking to Tom is a person Tom is a 3d model man he's done a lot of this he
00:18:55 would know more than you why can't you just accept that you probably don't know what you're talking
00:18:59 about here I don't accept that I don't accept that okay well you're welcome to be overly ignorant
00:19:05 in a public space it's totally fine anyway anyway this was just a rumor I heard so yeah yeah yeah
00:19:11 it's fine it's fine let's let's let's let's move on let's move on to something else please
00:19:16 well anyway the point was I think this game is not as horrible as everybody was getting all
00:19:21 in a tizzy about but does have many flaws as you sure it's a perfectly serviceable Pokemon
00:19:27 experience I I expect a Pokemon I got Pokemon I'm pretty happy honestly like my standards for
00:19:34 Pokemon are quite low so like they didn't surprise me in a bad way and actually like they build the
00:19:42 only real everybody feels it's funny how you guys are you're saying exactly what I expected as though
00:19:48 like it's good I like I'm sorry I'm having fun but I am I am not upset that you're having fun
00:19:56 but like I still think everything they did is bad I don't I'm not arguing you're focusing on all
00:20:02 that stuff because you haven't played the game and experienced any of the good stuff so how would
00:20:06 you there's no basic like it's like you can you can say that like there's this is a fun game it's
00:20:10 another good quality Pokemon experience and also be like game freak were kind of cunts for lying
00:20:16 about all this shit yeah like those are two things like I can I can make the wrong decisions and they
00:20:21 have the right priorities and stuff I mean I agree with all of that like I I feel like
00:20:27 that this attempt like I don't think game freak were like oh we can't physically do it I'm sure
00:20:32 they they have the you know the capacity to copy files over I think this was just like Nintendo
00:20:39 and game freak probably realized that the amount of Pokemon there is is too big and they want to
00:20:46 like curb like Pokemon what do you call it creep creep that's exactly what Pokemon creep okay so
00:20:56 like like they just want to in the future they want to set a precedent that not all the Pokemon are
00:21:00 gonna be in every game yeah obviously everybody hates that everybody does not like that that is
00:21:05 a thing but they you know they're just go they're introducing it now and they're probably gonna
00:21:10 do it in the next game it's like we've got new Pokemon we want you to care about these new Pokemon
00:21:15 and um I don't know like I I mean they probably should have just done that from the start I mean
00:21:21 they probably would have saved them because like they they really should have I've been saying ever
00:21:24 since like third gen that they're making too many new Pokemon every generation I think adding
00:21:30 hundreds of new ones every generation was inevitably going to lead to this point I would
00:21:35 rather they add like 20 to 30 each gen and focus on building out features because that's more interesting
00:21:41 yeah I like there's already because every generation we just have functional replacements
00:21:46 we got the bird we got the two bugs we got the fire water I mean that's true but you know what I
00:21:51 heard as they're just do I absolutely agree we have so many Pokemon new Pokemon are fine and all
00:21:56 but like yeah we don't look it's it's the core development decisions that are impacting a
00:22:01 large part of this because another theory I heard as to like one of maybe the main reasons they
00:22:05 didn't do this because there are several Pokemon that have appeared in the game's code uh that
00:22:10 was like the gen one the gen seven starters something like that and uh some of the discussion
00:22:14 that I heard around was that because they didn't want to make specifically Gigantamaxed models
00:22:20 of these and like you know potentially all the Pokemon who aren't in the game it was that
00:22:25 development decision I mean again this is just one of the competing theories we don't know
00:22:29 Gigantamaxed models are just the same model well not all of them Gigantamaxed models are scaled up
00:22:36 not every Pokemon Gigantamaxes right like some some have a special Gigantamax and
00:22:40 others just Dynamax but Dynamax models are just the same it's like it's like a mega form is that
00:22:45 true I don't know if that's true or not I believe right mage you've done you've done the rates and
00:22:49 stuff you would know the difference right they I mean they're definitely they look the same they
00:22:54 get bigger right I mean when Pikachu doesn't have a Gigantamax model it's just a big Pikachu
00:23:01 isn't yeah well okay Gigantamax it well Pikachu actually does change I've only seen the one uh
00:23:07 the the special boy you get from from let's go Pikachu which becomes the fat Pikachu
00:23:12 yeah so it's like slightly different I mean the tail is definitely different all the all the Gigantamax
00:23:20 Gigamax I don't fucking know which ones wait all the ones I've done have just been the same we've
00:23:24 seen Dynamaxed and Gigantamaxed Gengar and Gigantamaxed Gengar is like the weird one with a big
00:23:29 mouth and then there's Dynamax Gengar who's just Gengar but big and he has like a red texture
00:23:34 overlaid on him yeah as far as I understand it yeah red like specular lighting or whatever right
00:23:39 I haven't seen much of this in the game in any case I I feel like it's it's most likely they're
00:23:45 going to try and like make it so that in the future they don't have to put all the Pokemon in all the
00:23:50 games and people won't be as upset next time because they've expressly stated that's their desire for
00:23:55 people to be prepared for that but you know what it feels like it feels like that decision went into
00:24:01 like like laxadaisical designs for these new Pokemon knowing that in the future some of them
00:24:08 they can if they're not popular they can just you know easily not you know continue to use them
00:24:14 some of these designs are very stupid looking they are the new ones I'm just you know I guess
00:24:20 on some level I can sort of understand why they want to set a precedent of not every
00:24:25 past Pokemon is in every new game I don't think that's completely ridiculous I'm just
00:24:31 concerned because I think that like gen one is going to get like super overrepresented
00:24:36 and it already is yeah it's that's going to continue it's just when you consider the full
00:24:41 context where there was much discussion about how in the last gen or whatever they hired a company
00:24:46 to future proof the series by making high quality models that could be reused and now we're learning
00:24:52 like the next generation they've dropped I mean I just think it's not surprising that many of us
00:24:57 would be frustrated really yep yeah um I mean yeah like like what the Tom was saying I would
00:25:04 rather just have a few new Pokemon ever Jenna and focus on the features we don't need fucking we don't
00:25:10 need impudence for fuck's sake hey no actually you know like he grew on me no I won't fucking hear it
00:25:16 it's unacceptable we don't need ice cue for fuck's sake yeah ice you can go but impudence and it's
00:25:24 evolution I like them I big grown on me no you don't understand you don't understand I had him I had him
00:25:32 from him when he was a small baby boy I got him in a max rate so I got him early on and he was a
00:25:37 small baby boy and now he's a big big buff boy and and he has like your maternal instincts are blinding
00:25:42 you to raw but you don't understand I don't accept I don't accept his validity he's he's like he's like
00:25:47 my two favorite types in one I can't hate him I can't hate the boy what is he's ghosts fairy no dark
00:25:55 fairy dark fairy yeah fine that's all fine and I can't I can't prove it but I feel like the dragon
00:26:02 quest monsters models have been like exactly the same since the ps2 era mm-hmm like look they look
00:26:09 like they haven't changed at all through all the games I'm not familiar with the series so I wouldn't
00:26:13 know but it's just because they got like really strong design sense like updating the models
00:26:18 wouldn't make much of a difference anyway but like I don't know it's a different it's a different
00:26:24 thing because it used to be in 2d yeah it doesn't matter I guess dragon quest used to be in 2d as
00:26:28 well I want to remind people of a story we're gonna get 4d pokemon look at this horse dude okay
00:26:36 apparently there's only like seven there's eight pokemon that have a gigantamax form
00:26:43 sounds about right eight of them here's the lit oh look at that they're all gen one and and four
00:26:50 okay charizard butterfree pikachu uh meowth eevee eevee corvanite dreadna and alchemy alchemy
00:27:01 this just reminds me of like the the pathetic display of the amount of a lowland pokemon forms that
00:27:07 were there's like 13 or something are there more galarian forms than there were no i feel like
00:27:13 there's more but not well maybe well let me well let's see there might be like nine there's wheezing
00:27:18 there's farfetched there's mr mime i was arguing with um kazi and munchie the other day that like
00:27:25 to me an alolan form is basically a new pokemon and i know and i'm willing i'm willing to give them
00:27:32 that um oh no i mean pathetic and the like the amounts that they didn't change from gen one like
00:27:38 there's so many gen one pokemon in sun and moon oh the alolan pokemon were like they were cool
00:27:44 and there was only like 10 of them forms ivo yeah uh like a lot of them are bad like alolan meowth
00:27:51 and is pretty shit i i love alolan puritan puritan with his wide face it's it's better but like
00:27:57 alolan meowth is literally just meowth with fucking a different expression there's a
00:28:02 fucking galarian meowth too oh yeah that was the whole door galarian meowth is better because it's
00:28:07 more different yeah i like it like fucking fucking uh snowy volpix is like beautiful like this yeah
00:28:15 yeah i wanted i just wanted more alolan forms i didn't want to see magic herb again i didn't
00:28:21 want to see goldine again goldine is back baby i hate her so much why is goldine back we don't
00:28:29 need goldine replace it was just like really fun it was like a red one when you watch the show and
00:28:33 every time misty would throw out goldine would just flap around on the ground she'd get pissed off
00:28:38 yeah goldine is shit okay what if they made like galarian uh goldine and seeking that were like
00:28:45 fucking awesome what if i would love it what if they were like fighting steel type and they were
00:28:49 just like super bad i would love it because it would be it would be new and it would be fresh
00:28:54 and it would be something it would be fucking anything yeah i mean that's kind of what they
00:28:59 did with farfetched and maybe meow yeah that's right because like every generation like we said
00:29:04 they have the three birds that's basically piggy but again but like different and like it's it's
00:29:09 fine and it's different sometimes the the the bird pokemon of the day is like lame but sometimes
00:29:16 it's really cool i like the galarian was pretty cool yeah i the talent thing was cool i like the
00:29:20 galarian far farfetched because he's like looking down at you like your scum it was funny i love
00:29:26 galarian farfetched man bobapedia doesn't have images up of all the different galarian forms
00:29:31 yet it's kind of disappointing you know what you know what call me when pokemon is like at a point
00:29:37 where goldine isn't there and then i'll buy it immediately of all the pokemon to keep i you
00:29:43 know it's i mean they don't keep miscellaneous forgotten fish actually they do keep some of them
00:29:48 from other like basculin he's in there what does he evolve into i don't know something else
00:29:54 it doesn't it just has like two then why the fuck is he in this game what do you want that
00:29:59 pokemon what do you mean why is he in the game just because he doesn't evolve a lot of pokemon
00:30:04 done sparse does anyone gonna use basculin does anyone want basculin what's basculin okay but
00:30:09 whether or not he's basically a magic problem not well okay okay the evolution true like scarmery's
00:30:15 good scarmery doesn't evolve but i mean that's just one piece of the puzzle here it's that it's a
00:30:20 basculin is uh i mean is basculin's not the most exciting pokemon no it's true
00:30:26 i'd say he's the most exciting pokemon well i've never seen anything that's pretty funny
00:30:30 he's better than goldine i get excited about how unexcited i am when i see basculin um i don't
00:30:36 know but at least basculin's got something going on with the red and green it's got the red and
00:30:41 blue forms sort of that don't have any meaningful difference between them whatsoever how exciting
00:30:48 okay i don't want to i don't want to go to bat too hard for basculin
00:30:53 even though we had that's the legendary banana banana if galarian basculin looks like this image
00:30:58 you just link give here that's in the show notes i would be fully on board or maybe evolved into
00:31:04 a basculin form eval fighting fighting water we need we need less less anthro less anthro pokemon
00:31:12 please i want all anthro and the end i want everyone to be my choke
00:31:19 that'd be good okay guys i want i've been wanting to say like uh this whole controversy with pokemon
00:31:25 and i like i'm not people aren't wrong um but uh what it reminds me of um is a little game called
00:31:32 fable and how it absolutely messed up initially at least from what i heard like it made so many
00:31:38 promises that it couldn't keep and people were really angry about it but me when i was when i was
00:31:45 little i didn't know anything about the controversies and i played fable for the first time and i loved
00:31:50 it it was such a good game and it still is and i i have it on my well i'll tell you why i'll i can
00:31:56 tell you why that happened it's because stiff that's a stiff and malin you uh peter peter malin you
00:32:02 he endorsed peter malin yeah pokemon and it was all downhill from there yeah um no peter peter
00:32:08 malin you right the the okay peter peter malin you the guy who made he made all these fucking games
00:32:14 and peter malin you is just like a chronic over promissor and he just hyped up the game and said
00:32:19 like how realistic it was going to be how many features it was going to have what a diversity
00:32:22 famous you can plant a seed and come back like years later and it'll grow into an actual tree
00:32:27 crazy shit like that shocking um so it was it was it was it wasn't that the game was bad
00:32:35 it was that it was overhyped and overpromised and the developer made all these promises
00:32:39 didn't keep it's basically the same it's the same thing that happened with no man sky
00:32:42 same thing that happened with spore um it's not that the game it's not that the game was like
00:32:48 necessarily horrible it's that it was supposed to be something different the developer set the bar
00:32:53 too high like you have to control your pr or you're fucked like you can make a nine out of 10
00:32:57 but if you promise an 11 out of 10 it's gonna be a two out of 10 in everyone's books because like
00:33:01 fuck you you lied to me yeah it's like i bought this game because i thought i could do x y and i
00:33:06 can only do right because like you're only gonna focus on what isn't there at that point because
00:33:10 it's like oh you hyped up and told me i could do this and now i can't do this so fuck you like
00:33:16 you're just you're just adding extra baggage to your game that doesn't need to be there that was
00:33:21 that was the case that's shit on the dl until you know it's gonna be and peter mollin you apparently
00:33:25 he'd just like he'll do this with every game that he makes so he'll promise the moon and then he'll
00:33:31 the game will come out and everyone will be like where's the fucking moon asshole and he'll be like
00:33:35 and then he'll go silent for a while and come be like hey guys fable two i'm so that was embarrassing
00:33:41 dog shit it was going to put fable three like this is where we're gonna really realize everything
00:33:46 that i said i was gonna do and ten times more but you know that all being the case that's all
00:33:51 even though like while it's being developed be like guys we fucking nailed it like we're fucking
00:33:54 nailing it it's everything i said i don't know why he's everything i said and more and then as soon
00:33:59 as it comes out ah it just not it fucked up a responsible game developer who has like any amount
00:34:04 of information on like how games are made and like what contemporary games can do like should never
00:34:09 have promised the things that peter mollin you promised in fable it's ridiculous to think that
00:34:13 your game would have those features but uh uh considering this game it's just the fact that
00:34:19 i know how pokemon is developed lately i.e. disappointingly and with tons of flaws and
00:34:26 just the whole world is talking about all these bad things about the game that are all bad but
00:34:32 slightly less than everybody i don't know seem to be expressing i just feel like there was so much
00:34:37 criticism that now that i'm playing it and i kind of feel like the promise that was given to me by
00:34:42 gamefreak was a new pokemon game it has you know dynamax that's it that's no they definitely
00:34:48 definitely did not over they definitely did not over promise with sword and shield it and that's
00:34:54 why i think i feel relatively satisfied my disappointment is just from the lack of evolution
00:34:59 the series has shown perfectly over a million billion years do you think that um uh like uh a
00:35:07 natural a backlash against the backlash is allowing you to enjoy pokemon whereas otherwise you would
00:35:12 be like yeah this is yeah but i mean you're enjoying it exactly as i think it doesn't make
00:35:17 just as much sense as someone being mad at fable for being over promised like is one valid and the
00:35:22 other isn't valid i think i'm not talking about i'm not talking about valid i'm just wondering like
00:35:26 do you think um the backlash like the overwhelming backlash against pokemon is making your mood
00:35:32 playing the game better than it would otherwise be at the start slightly yes because i was expecting
00:35:37 it to be so bad uh and it uh wasn't that i've never i've never assumed that pokemon is going to
00:35:44 like the children shield is going to be a bad game i just assumed it's going to be technically
00:35:48 unimpressive and not have my favorite pokemon which is all the outrage really has ever been
00:35:52 not and not do anything too new or interesting i mean the playthrough so far is straight up
00:35:57 better than sun and moon so like and i didn't expect that and so i'm just i'm you know happy
00:36:02 that that is the case it's it has many of the same flaws as sun and moon but it's slightly less
00:36:06 annoying moment by moment and there's like more gems which i'm happy to have back there's eight
00:36:12 instead of you know whatever the weird thing they were doing in elola and uh and yeah i don't know
00:36:17 i mean the everything about the pokemon not being in the game that haunts me i hate that but that's
00:36:22 end game that's after you beat the elite four and i haven't done that yet so it hasn't impacted
00:36:26 the experience yet so just my moment to moment playing is uh yeah i like i like the characters
00:36:32 and i like the story so far they're all just terrible i mean they're not bad it's not it's
00:36:39 nothing is there um is there an is there like a team skull like or like an edgy gladeon or whatever
00:36:46 his name is uh team yell and bd can you um can you can you ride can you ride on your pokemon
00:36:53 nope no sadly zero out of ten yeah sorry there's no following pokemon there's no i
00:37:00 they literally put that in in fucking go go let's go pikachu or whatever the what
00:37:06 what game am i talking about the one that had the let's go let's go oh i was right yeah they
00:37:11 literally had the ability to ride your pokemon and let's go pikachu and let's go evie and they and
00:37:15 they why why would they make a good feature and then they just throw it away i mean they did the
00:37:21 same thing with heart and they pulled it out so it has always been about i guess like adding great
00:37:27 features that improve the experience and then forgetting about them because they were the
00:37:30 gimmick of that one generation yeah yep i mean that that's the only thing they keep
00:37:35 is pikachu and that's it well i cannot believe that mega forms have just been dropped it is
00:37:41 beyond belief personally so much are they i never like mega forms so well neither did i
00:37:47 but they made it a main thing i was forced to accept them under protest and now they just remove
00:37:52 what are they just completely dropped like you cannot do them that's correct yeah are you sure
00:37:58 because you couldn't do them in alola until end game so like is it an end is it a thing maybe you
00:38:03 can access once you get to the end no i'm pretty sure like there's there's nothing in the game yeah
00:38:08 there's nothing in the game indicating that you would be able to link there's no no now it's all
00:38:13 about the like six pokemon that you can gigantamax look you can dynamax and there's a new mega there's
00:38:19 a new form of mega forms and it's just worse and there's less of it but you can dynamax like
00:38:25 literally any pokemon only some of them have fancy and this is talking to somebody who there's like
00:38:31 now godzilla mecha godzilla and mothra essentially in pokemon and even i'm like maybe this was not
00:38:36 the best use of your resources it's literally eight pokemon have a special gigantamax form these are
00:38:42 the things these are all six of the traumatized five of them are gen one five of them are gen one
00:38:48 three of them are gen what nine are we on nine now we you shouldn't even consider the dynamax
00:38:53 thing like like okay mega evolutions functioned as like a new evolutionary form these aren't
00:38:58 basically not like that at all it's just no they can get big i don't think you understand what a
00:39:02 mega form is because a gigantamax is way more similar to a mega than to a regular evolution
00:39:07 well i mean mega forms were nothing like a regular evolution they were just like a thing you could
00:39:11 activate in battle i'm aware of how they function in battle but they give you like a new form to
00:39:16 the pokemon and like new types and stuff shout out if every pokemon had a like specific
00:39:24 changed form if every pokemon had like a specifically changing form when they dynamax
00:39:32 or whatever like then it'd be like kind of like a new form but because only like eight of them
00:39:37 i mean what's butterfree's dynamax or it just gets really big wings and its body stays small
00:39:42 it's not that's nothing bro what are you talking about like literally what are you talking about
00:39:47 i'm i'm just trying to compare the the distinction between why i found mega forms to be like like
00:39:54 mawile mawile didn't have an evolution but it got a mega form that basically functioned like
00:40:00 sort of like it was an evolution in how it looks and how it fights and that stuff okay okay where
00:40:05 it doesn't mechanically function that way how is how is gigantamaxing different exactly let me
00:40:11 explain okay so like because no one is a new form yeah like okay let me talk go on then mega forms
00:40:18 so like they change the typing of the poke most most often as i don't remember if there's any that
00:40:24 don't change the typing uh sometimes they get new abilities as well and you know they get like a new
00:40:30 a new uh look to them like and so it's almost like a new evolution for them in in in a way
00:40:38 it's a temporary one but yeah whereas dynamaxing they just get big and stronger um but like with
00:40:48 the exception of those eight but even those eight that do look different they still have the same
00:40:54 abilities and typing and stuff they're just big so is there what's the what's the difference between
00:41:03 dynamaxing and gigantamaxing uh dynamaxing is like everyone gets big like literally any pokemon
00:41:09 can get big that's all yes i understand gigantamaxing they look slightly different when they get big
00:41:17 but it's but it's um like it's visual it's just visual it's only a visual difference as far as i
00:41:23 know i could be wrong but as far as i've observed it's just a visual thing this is the this is
00:41:30 the fucking worst i mean we could all agree it's shit it's it's dumb and whatever whatever it's
00:41:37 but i just i'm such an abused fan i hated megas i thought they were dumb i didn't want them but
00:41:42 you know what eventually i was like hey man we've moved on everybody we were doing megas now it's
00:41:47 time to accept it my argument for megas is that they add they do add some like strategy to like
00:41:53 like they do increase the fucking possibility space of like choices you have to make in battle
00:41:58 and i think they're defensible in that way so gigantamaxing it's like that it's like megas but
00:42:07 they don't do that well imagine gigantamaxing and pokemon showdown it just fills the screen you
00:42:13 can't see them anymore it does make a difference it's basically just you just power up one pokemon
00:42:17 for three turns that's yeah that's the okay that's it yeah so i guess i get i get i get that like
00:42:25 yeah like dynamaxing and gigantamaxing um um is uh you you've got to choose when to do it so it's
00:42:32 it's like a mix between a z move it's like a mix between a z move and a mega form
00:42:36 basically yes that's true that's that's true uh do i have to have an item do i need to be holding
00:42:42 an item to do that nope i mean technically but you get it in the game like in a cutscene so like
00:42:49 you don't you don't even know you have it yeah it's not something the pokemon has to be holding
00:42:54 in place of like a leftovers or a no no no no okay what were you saying gabby you were saying
00:42:59 something now it's just like reminiscing on on my favorite gimmick my favorite gimmick of the
00:43:06 fucking pokemon contests which which allowed um like pokemon that are not fit for battle
00:43:13 to still have a role in in the game and you could like you could get a tiny cute thing
00:43:19 and if it knows some cute moves you can win the cute contest and you can get a ribbon
00:43:22 i miss those that's true are they existed i never liked them i thought they were bullshit
00:43:27 wait i'm glad they're dead i have an idea and i don't know i don't know if this is like a good
00:43:33 or a bad thing but what if literally the point of dynamaxing i don't even want to say dynamaxing
00:43:40 and gigantamaxing because they're literally the same thing yeah what if what if the what if the
00:43:45 point of dynamaxing is that it is pointless and a a like like non-feature or like like a what if
00:43:56 we made a bad game on purpose guys what if what if the point is that it is like a stupid throwaway
00:44:02 thing that did not require a lot of thought or effort to incorporate into the game specifically
00:44:08 because they intend for it to be a throwaway feature that is like specific to this generation
00:44:13 and will never be used again and they're like wait we we worked so hard we made all these like we
00:44:18 put a lot of energy and time and resources into building these new features for these old games
00:44:22 and then we just even though they were good we just threw them away so we know we're gonna
00:44:26 just throw away whatever new features we make for the next game so why don't we just make it some
00:44:30 bullshit i mean i wouldn't blame them for thinking that way it's what's happening well i would almost
00:44:34 not blame them except that obviously it's like they're so close so close to the revelation that
00:44:39 maybe they shouldn't fucking make a good make good features and throw them away but they come to the
00:44:42 opposite conclusions like well let's just make our features worse so that it's not bad when we throw
00:44:46 them away i'm pretty sure they just got inspired by pokemon go when it's success
00:44:51 what the fuck are you fucking high what are you talking about like like like the the raids the
00:44:57 the pokemon are just real big yeah that could fucking be it that could actually be the reason
00:45:03 like people who play pokemon go they used to sing big pokemon we should put that in the new game
00:45:09 that's silly i see and then you go up with friends and you get battle the giant pokemon
00:45:15 i don't have any fucking friends mage okay i'm not getting the fucking game sorry it's fine
00:45:24 you don't have to i i literally don't mind people not getting the game maybe you know what maybe it's
00:45:31 maybe at some point i will get the game i'm not taking an ideological stance on like do not buy
00:45:35 this game i don't care that much uh but i i don't feel like spending the $60 right well now be the
00:45:40 time where people go as such as myself and seek out those mythical fan games that i've heard so much
00:45:45 about that they say it's time i mean yeah i mean to i just have been too lazy yeah i don't know
00:45:52 some some good some good stuff out there just use the fan game known as your imagination
00:45:56 i have to go take an angry piss okay i have one small gripe with the game i just very tell you
00:46:08 one uh among all the things that people are saying like um i've beaten five gyms so far
00:46:14 and like the choices for clothes you can buy is a bismuth so far with at least like sun and moon
00:46:22 you had like like very themed sort of shops throughout the town like oh there's like the
00:46:27 cute shop and then there's like the sporty shop and then there's like the the hipster shop or
00:46:32 something like that for clothes well this one is like do you want this sporty look or that sporty
00:46:38 look and i'm like where are my cute frilly dresses god damn it this is an athletic game for athletes
00:46:45 such as myself off i don't want to dress you know mage on this subject though i think that just
00:46:50 touches on kind of one larger point this is this is something people have said in general about it
00:46:54 and i wonder if you wait wait wait the looks are sporty i thought this was like in scotland i thought
00:46:58 you were going to be wearing like winter coats and stuff and mittens not really no like so far
00:47:03 all the gloves that are available uh look very sporty biker like like not biker but like biking
00:47:09 that's so lame gloves i know so far i've only beaten five gyms so i don't know maybe i'll be
00:47:14 proven wrong after the next gym and i'll get my frilly dress and i'll be happy but so far
00:47:19 like i had to i had to beat so much of the game and i still don't have my cute dress i am very
00:47:25 disappointed well okay so the issue i feel the boys wear kilts i i don't know i mean that's in there
00:47:32 i don't know uh so the this issue of like not a lot of clothes fair okay perhaps this touches
00:47:37 just into the larger issue that kind of touches all these issues that's like like okay on the this
00:47:42 is on the switch right this is like a console game i don't game for a small company whatever
00:47:46 but like when you just compare when you compare i mean i don't i don't know how many
00:47:50 fucking development staffers they have those those things matter but whatever like when you just
00:47:54 compare the other games that are like on the system i mean it's not hard to just be like wow this
00:48:00 game is like you know developed by babies compared to some of the other games that are on there and
00:48:05 then it's just it's reasonable to be like this is like the most profitable franchise in the
00:48:09 fucking world ever okay okay that that's not fair because why why is that not fair uh because uh
00:48:16 because the small development team game for a bigger team hire more people why doesn't get
00:48:22 that much money as people assume it does that's what no issues i okay but but mage mage that even
00:48:29 even if that's true the pokemon company does so why is a pokemon company not like hey game freak
00:48:36 here's some money i don't know why they don't do it i don't know okay i don't know which of these
00:48:41 companies is to blame but some combination of these companies should have said to themselves
00:48:46 hmm we have probably too few staff members i agree i agree i just don't i don't like people
00:48:52 saying like oh they have millions and millions of dollars they do though mage they do they literally
00:48:57 do well game freak is co-owner of the pokemon company someone at some point in the chain failed
00:49:04 to allot the necessary resources to fucking make i mean we can all agree on that they they fucking know
00:49:09 they don't need to though people still buy the game and they sing as praises and they defend it and
00:49:14 that's just how it will always be not me uh well i i do wish they would improve well i mean it's
00:49:23 really funny to compare this to like uh like what is it like xeno blade chronicles or some of those
00:49:28 games that just i mean like they look a million times better dragon quest and the render distance
00:49:34 is more than like 20 feet and you know i think things of this nature i still say even town looks
00:49:39 better than than pokemon i believe that aren't uh aren't they coming out with like a another pokemon
00:49:45 mobile app that they're gonna make millions upon billions of dollars already didn't they the uh
00:49:50 what is it like pokemon masters i think yeah masters which is by the way not a good game don't
00:49:55 play it it sucks i i've played it well i got my ham doom i stopped playing there you go
00:50:02 eight pokemon go eight billion can gigantamax
00:50:09 well not gengar is not one of them at least they cut half so it's not less than one percent
00:50:15 not according to bulbopedia well then it's wrong we've seen it's didn't we see it's you literally
00:50:20 saw the giant gengar that's stuck in the ground with its mouth open i mean is do you think is
00:50:26 bulbopedia just not up to date probably it's possible some information is let me all right well
00:50:30 let me let me let me check i mean and and i'm not sure if it was in bulbopedia but in one of those
00:50:35 pokemon uh sites it said like you can only get galarian ponita in pokemon sword which is not
00:50:40 true you can get it only in shield so you know yeah see i feel like there's been some things like that
00:50:46 that are maybe just straight up like incomplete or inaccurate that wait and we'll have a rosier
00:50:51 picture to a degree i don't know the things i'm complaining about but you know oh no okay bulb
00:50:56 i'm sorry bulbapedia is wrong okay the the list is still not that impressive but i'm counting one
00:51:02 two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
00:51:08 seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
00:51:13 twenty six twenty six pokemon have gigantic max four so that's something and let me count
00:51:19 how many of those are not new pokemon or first gen um zero yes it's literally none yes literally
00:51:29 every single one is either a gen one pokemon or a um really but the cake pokemon is new and i know
00:51:35 that's a new one that's what i said either gen one or a new pokemon here's the here's the here's the
00:51:39 list gengar charizard meowth eevee pikachu butterfree corvanite alcremie dredna garb oh wait no garbador
00:51:48 garbador is the one exception because he's the trash man yeah he's the daru daruladon daruladon
00:51:55 hatterine copper raja kingler sent to scorch oh it met oh and mel metal of course everyone's
00:52:00 favorite fucking mel metal uh oh right that legendary from yeah so okay so two are not of the
00:52:08 appleton gamers appleton grim snarl flapple sanaconda uh col colosal orbital toxic
00:52:15 toxicity terrible name by the way snorlax lapriss machamp what the fuck is with meowth who likes
00:52:23 meowth that is meowth turns into long cat bro long cat yeah yeah i guess it does bro
00:52:31 skinny is objectively better than i want i'm so disappointed they don't have skinny
00:52:37 meh i'm not like shitty hey
00:52:41 fuck you know you oh that's life baby read them in weep so all right that's that's that's the
00:52:49 spread this has been an hour of pokemon discussion this number this number actually makes it even
00:52:54 makes the uh the gen one bias like even worse and even more agree well do you not think going
00:53:01 forward it's going to be gen one plus whatever we made for this game and that's going to be the
00:53:05 focus like that seems like definitely sure fire away to make the box yes and then every and then
00:53:11 each one of those features that only include so don't get attached to any new pokemon and sword
00:53:16 and shield because they will be gone next yeah the next next generation all the special features
00:53:21 none of them will get none of them will get anything but luckily it's shit and i won't miss
00:53:26 gigantamaxing so i feel blessed luckily we made the features bad on purpose so you won't miss them
00:53:32 when they're gone wouldn't it be interesting if they made a game that actually had like a huge
00:53:36 amount of scope for some console like the switch i'm like you could go to all the regions in each
00:53:40 region had its gimmick but it only worked in that region that would be cool i mean that could happen
00:53:44 you know it it won't fucking happen it won't happen but someone could make that potentially
00:53:50 oh 100 it could be done pixel on minecraft oh yeah that's right page you're gonna have
00:53:56 page giant imagine to to to fucking pixel mon not not yet but i'm sure you already kind of have
00:54:02 that with pokemons having various sizes i suppose oh yeah you know we can gigantamax our uh or you
00:54:08 know our big our boofalons and we can also min max them by making them so very small you can't
00:54:13 even see them down there so really minimize minimize we've got the we've got the gutch coming in going
00:54:19 on the peace be minecraft server so here you go what happens if a gigantamaxed muck uses minimize
00:54:24 he just turned back to regularity that's a fascinating question it's a small but red
00:54:31 we'll see that happen i don't know like i because well i mean just when you're dynamaxed or whatever
00:54:36 like your moves change so i wonder if you don't have access to minimize when that happens to like
00:54:41 change the thought of it ahead of time they may have they may well have man imagine if
00:54:47 fucking mucks in real life could minimize then we wouldn't have so much pollution oh that's how
00:54:53 we get rid of pollution we just you know um we sent in ties tm minimize sentinize the the
00:54:59 landfills it turns into little pokemon we have to just bombard landfills with radiation in hopes
00:55:04 that they evolve into muck and don't do more damage to the environment we need we need to go there
00:55:09 and wheezing because yeah we do oh that's true that's what we really need yeah yeah that's um it
00:55:15 which is basically carbon tax the pokemon i feel i feel like i feel like um like this gen
00:55:23 has has something to say about about like global warming because of like that stupid penguin
00:55:30 and then like the dead corsela and uh the wheezing well hang on you know i heard that was a little
00:55:36 bit of fake news about that corsela wasn't that like a isn't bleached coral just like a natural thing
00:55:41 or was i wrong is that it's ghost type i yeah i could be wrong so what what's this what's the
00:55:49 relevant implications it's dead yeah uh there's a variant that's a ghost oh maybe okay maybe i
00:55:57 kind of need a little more than that if the point is just the the coral's dying okay cool got it
00:56:02 but uh i don't know yeah like i i i could be wrong i don't mind being wrong i i'm just if i may i
00:56:09 would like if i may i would like to change the subject permanently please okay let's do it and uh
00:56:17 and uh to elia czar please at the beginning as soon as we start talking about pokemon put on screen
00:56:23 click that click this timestamp to skip from the pokemon discussion to the politics discussion
00:56:31 yes yeah change my mind let's go back to pokemon i want to follow up on on the thing i was i was
00:56:38 looking into yeah or talking about like a labor and general election in the uk please uh the bbc
00:56:47 website has this little thing the the manifestos aren't out yet which is annoying this i really
00:56:52 want to read up and see what the fuck they're actually talking about but the things they've
00:56:55 all been saying on their campaigns have been like tallied up and and put into like little a little
00:57:01 drop down menu so you click on what party and it will tell you like based on health and economy
00:57:08 and education like what their policies have been like spoken okay and i was looking around and you
00:57:14 know uh labor seems to be the one for me um conservatives are you know i policy i'm not
00:57:21 really going to talk about but the one thing i wanted to mention is that i checked out the brexit
00:57:26 party and obviously they are like generally not for me but there was one thing that really annoyed me
00:57:34 yeah it's that break the brexit party want to abolish the first pass the post voting system
00:57:40 and implement majority or you know the the better alternative the one that everyone wants that
00:57:46 wouldn't make democracy a lot more fairer okay so like so like and labor and conservatives the most
00:57:53 likely parties to win don't promise that at all so it's just sort of reinforces the idea that the
00:57:59 better voting system is not encouraged by the parties who win all the time because they know
00:58:05 that if they allow that to happen they would stop being in power and it would stop being a two-party
00:58:09 system and i hate the idea that if i want that fucking thing i need to vote brexit party i i'm
00:58:14 not going to do that it sucks you know who want you know who wants voting reform
00:58:22 bernie sanders but also yang and i think a couple of the other democrats in i mean okay like in
00:58:27 america we vote for a congressman obviously like separately from the executive branch and stuff
00:58:32 whereas okay actually to be fair i don't actually know how it works who are you you in english you
00:58:37 vote for the party you want right and then they get x number of representatives in the parliament
00:58:44 is that there's there's the country is split up into constituencies and you have members of parliament
00:58:50 people who stand to become members of parliament and you vote for them in your local area they get
00:58:57 elected and then they represent the the party that part of okay so that's pretty much like it works
00:59:02 it's the same okay yeah i'm sorry i just missed so are you voting for a person are you voting for
00:59:06 a party you're voting for a person okay um and who rep who is part of a party yes okay got it got it
00:59:14 i assume it's the same in the the u.s but with senators or something like that yeah the senate
00:59:19 and uh the house representatives someone okay this guy um i was talking about lula the the
00:59:26 brazilian uh former president who uh got uh who was put in jail on like a lot of people
00:59:32 say they were trumped up charges of corruption we got it again that we're taking down the brazilians
00:59:37 these were trumped up charges he this is how i get my legacy like the supreme court voted that
00:59:42 that was that he shouldn't he doesn't have to be in jail anymore um so he's out and uh bernie's happy
00:59:49 about it and this uh this guy tom tom thanks tom tom for this heads up let me fucking read he said
00:59:55 he he he messaged me on discord like tom but there's two of them he said to tell me about like dude uh
01:00:01 hell yeah lula uh and he said i think this is impossible for me to try this is just too funny
01:00:07 i had to read it i think it's impossible for me to translate this to you but lula is not only cool
01:00:12 because of what he represents he is absolute peak commie swagger he got a new girlfriend while in
01:00:17 jail and on one of his first videos out of jail he said quote i am this is a translation i am a
01:00:23 74 year old man with the energy of a 30 year old and the hard on of a 20 year old i want to fight
01:00:30 um pretty cool if true i mean you know death to commies but that's pretty funny
01:00:40 that's funny it's a funny joke um okay so that's all i have to say about politics other than that
01:00:47 it depressed congratulations lulu i loved your appearance in final fantasy 10 it was a great
01:00:52 uh it was a great time yeah so who you voted for hippo you voted you voted in labor um well
01:00:59 my constituency is just based on the name of the party i feel like labor is probably the one for me
01:01:03 but that's really all we need to know at the end of the day that's not what i that's the opposite of
01:01:07 what i was gonna say i mean yeah labor is jeremy corbin is seems like in a many ways a bernie sanders
01:01:15 sort of guy which is why everyone hates him yeah uh that's my impression they don't want to him
01:01:20 they don't want him to give money to people who need it no so what the fuck yeah so uh i'm
01:01:27 probably voting for him hopefully like the the the moment my constituency is conservative but
01:01:34 it's only by a small number of people so hopefully that can be switched we can fucking we can really
01:01:39 don't i really i really have doubts for like labor having a large enough majority to make
01:01:46 a serious like difference that they can actually implement the policies that they want to yeah
01:01:52 like it no matter what happens everyone is still like split in the country nobody's
01:01:58 really talking and and and you know caring about each other and each other's problems i went to
01:02:05 i went to tasty burger uh with kazi and munchie on friday or i don't know whenever i went i went
01:02:11 the other day and uh i went and i got the i was drinking my i was drinking my bullshit piss water
01:02:17 light beers low carb ha ha i was i drank i was drinking at the bar and there was this guy this
01:02:23 guy next to me was talking to the bartender and i realized they were talking about politics
01:02:28 and this guy next to me he was like he was like a he was a good boy bernie bro and i and i my
01:02:35 heart bled for him he was talking to the bartender and the bartender was just like the bartender
01:02:40 was arguing for why we were for why we should keep trump in office and his argument was like
01:02:45 politicians all lie the government is corrupt and trump is the worst of them all he's the biggest
01:02:51 liar and the most corrupt of them all but like that's good because it'll expose the bad things
01:03:00 that was his argument and he like i mean he's he's steadfastly stood by it he would not be
01:03:05 just waited from this government is totally evil then i suppose putting an incompetent at the
01:03:11 head of it as a way of dismantling it is not the craziest idea as opposed to someone who's it
01:03:17 good right at perpetuating that you're correct you're correct nate accelerationists are psychotic
01:03:22 freaks and shouldn't be allowed to vote well his argument supposed to be that because trump is
01:03:26 outside of like the system that his the reason for his corruption is for exposing the bullshit
01:03:33 or just that he's operating for his own gain and not the the system's gain so therefore
01:03:39 like his motives are different no i just wanted to think of a way to say trump is all right i think
01:03:45 he didn't i mean maybe if i'd gotten more of a more of his take he might have elaborated but
01:03:51 all i heard him say was that like trump is it seemed to be the idea that trump is the most corrupt
01:03:57 and the worst and therefore like having him in power will mobilize people against the government
01:04:04 i think me or or will like expose or will will like it was me my impression is that it's basically
01:04:10 uh let's make things let's just make things as worse as they can be things if like they'll make
01:04:15 things really bad like things are bad now but they can really bad and then people will have to get
01:04:19 angry and do something about it or yeah it's like it's it's like i kind of see where he's coming from
01:04:25 but it's just it doesn't make sense because when obama was in office all of the you know the other
01:04:31 side were like trying to get rid of him the whole time here's my question and they didn't do anything
01:04:37 here's here's my question is like well okay if you think that trump being a thing is gonna like be so
01:04:42 bad and so upsetting that it will inspire like a counter movement then like okay so here like
01:04:49 for example we are we somewhat like an opposing party comes along as like hey let's swing the
01:04:54 pendulum the other way and do something different why would you then be like nah though keep trump
01:05:00 like shouldn't you be in favor of the counter movement well i think i think the the again i'm
01:05:05 just putting words in this guy's mouth obviously but if you if you think the entire system needs to
01:05:08 be torn down like a party solution obviously is not going to fix anything like this guy clearly
01:05:13 wants like violent action i guess that's true um i don't want violent action personally i don't know
01:05:19 about but he might just want i mean this based on the little detail we have it sounds like he
01:05:24 probably wants smaller government if i had to guess this guy's desires for how the world should be
01:05:30 maybe violent actions putting too many words but clearly he wants a solution that's not government
01:05:35 based because it sounds like the entire system is not he has no faith in it anymore yeah i guess so
01:05:41 yeah like it's like even if trump like being the president people aren't gonna think you know
01:05:49 because trump was a bad president therefore presidents are like a bad idea and then if the
01:05:54 democrat comes in next they're not going to be thinking that for them because they're a different
01:06:00 person yeah if it's not it's not going to dismantle anything i mean if any like the the
01:06:05 attitude is bad because it like people hate trump so much that they'll fucking be happy with some
01:06:11 fucking idiot like joe biden just because he's not trump and it's very distressing very depressing
01:06:16 i'm very upset i can't even think straight uh i can't abide by that i just found out that devolve
01:06:22 patrick's apparently gonna run now too yeah that's right our old governor of massachusetts are more
01:06:26 people declaring oh yeah yeah hurry any day now man any day now no oh yeah oh yeah it's her turn ben
01:06:36 and i want to have you mansplain her out of the race stop it's too late the fucking debates are
01:06:41 already going are you kidding me well i guess i guess the crackpot theory right now with devolve
01:06:47 patrick is that because these friends with obama he's gonna have obama basically backstab biden
01:06:51 and like come out and support devolve because devolve patrick was basically died obama here in
01:06:56 massachusetts he like had basically the exact same kind of like leanings you know what you know what
01:07:02 him as obama too to have to have obama withdraw his support from biden and back someone else and
01:07:08 split up biden's constituency sounds wonderful so a change i take back everything i said i love
01:07:13 you devolve patrick thank you for running thank you for doing this are you at all concerned that
01:07:16 devolve patrick could theoretically be worse than biden in some way that i don't um well i mean i
01:07:22 have no i mean okay fair enough but probably not i mean probably not if he's if he's he's probably
01:07:28 just he's probably similar he's probably similar to biden he's probably similar to biden if obama
01:07:34 is gonna back him um but also like not senile and also just we gotta split that voting block
01:07:41 by the way just slightly here um uh gib on the on the subject of you uh you know in your your
01:07:47 discussion of labor i was just curious because i had heard recently everybody's favorite political
01:07:51 commentator sargon i heard him say the other day that labor expects to take a some some some
01:07:59 serious hits something like losing many many of their boys and i have no idea i don't know
01:08:04 british politics at all but i'm wondering if you are is that is that do you know of this is this
01:08:08 something happening or is it foolishness what do you mean hits like i mean like half of them will
01:08:13 be voted out of office in the upcoming election is what is what the fear was sargon would say that
01:08:19 i mean i haven't heard that i've been watching mostly bbc news and this liberal media back at it
01:08:26 again like well bbc is generally impartial but they they do skew to the left um but uh i think
01:08:34 that the people have been like saying that labor has like thrown out so many big numbers like i'm
01:08:41 going to do this and this and this and all this money is going to come from uh taxing the giant
01:08:46 corporations and the super wealthy and it's like yeah but if you do that the amazon and google will
01:08:51 leave you can't you can't expect them to actually give the money um so it's like oh how could you
01:08:57 possibly like he said the other day um by 2030 we're going to have superfast fiber optic broadband
01:09:06 cables uh uh like owned by the the people rather than a company and it's going to be called british
01:09:12 broadband and we're going to give it to the the entire country and it's like that's going to cost
01:09:16 a lot of money um but it would be nice but like people were like hmm how are you going to do that
01:09:22 it's like i don't know money i don't know economics or like what the amount of money we
01:09:27 have at the moment is in order to spend on that and of course brexit is going to change things like
01:09:33 with trade deals and all that stuff so yeah i don't actually know much about how how feasible
01:09:38 most of these things that are being said by any party are all i do know is that the conservatives
01:09:45 have been running the country for a long time like a decade and they fucked it up in many many
01:09:50 ways and i don't like them so any change is good yeah labor is pretty pretty it's pretty good
01:09:57 pretty good to me thanks man thanks for that thanks for making me feel a little better
01:10:04 well anyone else got away in elizar feel free to drop a timestamp here to skip the
01:10:11 politics discussion yeah we it's like that's a good show everybody we touch on everything everyone
01:10:16 wants to hear about oh wait no wait one one last little small topic um i went to uh the royal
01:10:24 albert hall a few days ago a big place really big uh very cool um i was up in the gallery uh and i
01:10:31 was seeing snarky puppy the jazz oh you showed me that my favorite streamer yes my favorite
01:10:38 streamer on twitch.tv yes uh she was streaming live in the royal albert hall uh no like the jazz
01:10:48 fusion prog rock cool guy band full of uh you got the the three piece brass uh virtuosos and and
01:10:56 like the super like percussion maniacs and the and the drummer he was insane and the they were all
01:11:01 going nuts playing their music and it was really fun and i was up in the very very top and it was
01:11:07 like 20 pounds for that ticket it was a standing ticket and if you see pictures of the royal
01:11:13 albert hall you can see you know there's chairs and there's boxes and stuff but right at the top
01:11:19 there's like this like big open space of a ring but just like a like a a ledge you just lean on
01:11:26 and it was so cool damn that's a big ass zone i'm looking at in this place uh here posting an image
01:11:32 over in the chat over here uh it's it's like if if if anybody has an opportunity to go to a place
01:11:40 that has like a standing room at the top i don't know how many places have that but i really actually
01:11:47 prefer it to having a seat because when you have a seat it's like a cinema you can't you can't like
01:11:53 really your legs are stuck you don't have anywhere to actually put your drink without kicking it if
01:11:57 there's no cup holder um and every time somebody anywhere near you needs to go to the bathroom you
01:12:03 have to stand up and shuffle through but when you're up at the top you're just sort of standing you're
01:12:07 like you're you're like on the balcony basically just looking at looking down you can walk around
01:12:11 there's bars right behind us you could just go and get a drink and these guys are like a they're
01:12:16 like a jammin ass fun boy kind of get up on your feet and move a little bit kind of group yeah so
01:12:22 you know what he's sitting down for this bullshit yeah they they were grooving they had a big old
01:12:26 bit where um they were having a the half the Royal Albert Hall was clapping three four and the other
01:12:34 half was clapping four four it was like drum beats it was like whoa yeah clapping it was like clapping
01:12:40 and tapping my feet and moving my head like yeah this is really fucking good i love snarky puppy
01:12:45 i've been to some concerts where like you're sitting down and it i feel bad for the performers
01:12:50 because sitting down and watching feels like i mean i bought my dad tickets for his birthday
01:12:54 wants to um uh oh shit what is it uh fleetwood mac we saw fleetwood mac once and oh yeah it was uh it
01:13:01 was cool and all that but uh like we were sitting down in the area and i just felt bad like i wasn't
01:13:07 being into the performance enough even though it was totally sick and uh it was awesome um i forget
01:13:12 the the guitarist but he's a fucking shred master i only know albert hall because i heard a like
01:13:19 world war two like fight song one time that goes like hitler has only got one ball the other is in
01:13:28 the albert hall his mother the dirty bugger cut it off him when he was small why i don't remember
01:13:38 where i heard that that that is a that is a fun like i think it's a football chant it's just or
01:13:43 why would you chant about hitler at football i mean he's not he did it during world war two
01:13:48 or something it's a sing it's a sing song thing that like that like melody would be sung at a
01:13:52 football show can you just like insert anyone in place of hitler it's the sort of it's the sort
01:13:56 of thing i heard when i was a kid in in in the playground like you know edgy kid would say about
01:14:02 hitler has only got one ball he's with the batman the christmas uh what was it uh just uh yeah um
01:14:10 batmobile lost a wheel and a joker got away yeah very edgy very edgy yeah imagine the joker
01:14:18 winning that's making fun of hitler was a really fun past time for for young school boys now we
01:14:22 take it for some reason now i've made that hobby into my career and let me tell you it's going great
01:14:27 we didn't really do that as in america growing up because we didn't need to have kicked his ass we
01:14:32 weren't we weren't we weren't concerned about the whole hitler question it was pretty much a settled
01:14:37 question i'd say uh yeah you know what another grounded tread uh just to finish the the the
01:14:44 story i i put like a snippet of that on instagram oh and it was like really fucking sick and like oh
01:14:51 yeah people are gonna love see like people are gonna be impressed that i like this kind of music
01:14:56 put it on instagram uh and it got muted within a few hours well because i copyright yeah but like
01:15:02 it was a live performance but i think the reason was was they were they were recording it and
01:15:09 um they said the guys said at the end uh this recording was actually like a live album so you
01:15:15 know you're all gonna be in it and it's like oh i'm gonna be in a live album what if i yelled
01:15:19 really loud the whole time so i get like a little what if i what if i yelled really loud onto the
01:15:24 album uh patreon.com slash tpcrastinators oh that'd be good is it tpcrastinators it's the
01:15:32 procrastinators for the procrastinators whoops whoops that's what i said oh no those assholes
01:15:42 at tpcrastinators are gonna see a spike damn it i think like that night they made a mix of it and
01:15:48 then it got copyrighted and it got fucked so that sucks i don't like that that happened so quickly
01:15:55 but uh whatever yeah that's too bad i mean just as a competing theory perhaps i mean that okay that
01:16:00 all makes sense but like some events like this they just say no recording allowed even if they're
01:16:04 not making they they didn't have anything like that up there and i don't know but it was it was
01:16:10 i only recorded right at the end it was muted by instagram right not by um like this company or
01:16:16 yeah yeah just well i it i didn't get like an email saying it'd just been muted it was just
01:16:21 this video has no sound like a few hours later it's like oh i have such a strong sense of deja vu
01:16:26 about this conversation had happened but i know it couldn't have happened but my god deja vu
01:16:34 major dream powers are getting out of control they're bleeding into the waking world we're
01:16:37 seeing the future no that's the thing like it's always i always get the sense of deja vu only
01:16:42 after it starts happening i'm like well what good is that if i can't even tell if it's gonna
01:16:46 happen in the future because deja vu isn't real it's an illusion it's uh just a minor trick on
01:16:51 itself you know i mean i did talk i may have talked a while ago about a similar thing where
01:16:58 um i had films uh like a record player playing a led zeppelin song and i got muted i don't know
01:17:04 why i would have talked about that though maybe because like it sounds very similar to the point
01:17:09 of all like what nate was saying as well is also very similar to it's your brain it's tricking
01:17:16 itself i hate my brain it does shit don't we all uh time to time to take that that brain out behind
01:17:23 the the the bike shifts and kill it speaking of killing it uh let's get to the voicemails what do
01:17:30 you say las wait wait wait i got a i got a funny i got a funny story so i believe it or not i'm
01:17:36 going to be on uh i don't believe it i'm gonna be on the next or it'll be the it'll be tomorrow
01:17:42 after this episode release of this saturday this upcoming saturday i'm gonna be uh me and mumke
01:17:46 jones are gonna do an is it kino uh on on twitch is that all i guess he'll be streaming it and
01:17:53 and florian i i guess is it kino is a twitch show now um i guess i think most of the stuff is twitch
01:18:00 yeah so he they they those two invited me to do uh what will you be reviewing uh uh well they asked
01:18:06 me if there were any underrated or unknown movies and and i was very excited i immediately was like
01:18:12 turbo kid have you guys seen turbo kid i heard i know what i heard about turbo kid is fucking
01:18:18 awesome okay turbo kid is sick as fuck so i'm wicked stoked to expose turbo kid uh to an audience
01:18:26 it's really good uh so i guess me and mumke and florian aka game squad i guess he'll be streaming
01:18:32 it i'll be streaming it on my twitch as well and i think it'll probably be like one or two p.m
01:18:36 on saturday so i don't know twitch.tv slash st comics whoo um and also everyone should watch
01:18:43 turbo kid it's really fucking cool movie it's like a see it's like a low it's like a low budget um
01:18:49 like canadian it's sort of like a mad max kind of thing but like the protagonist is like a
01:18:55 kid who finds like a magic glove that makes him into a superhero is it quite graphic it is like
01:19:01 comedically graphic like there are like jesus is going to like this there are like blood and
01:19:06 guts but it's like it's kind of silly i think i remember uh red letter media giving it a favorable
01:19:12 review back in the day if i wait really did red letter media review turbo kid i believe it might
01:19:16 have been like a wrap up or i know they talked about the sequel not the sequel but like the next
01:19:21 movie that those guys did in like their 2018 wrap up i'm gonna google it which was i think the summer
01:19:27 of 84 was the next one they did i can't remember okay yeah here we go we're half in the bag episode
01:19:32 95 the visit and turbo kid i must have watched this uh in 2015 holy shit i'm fucking old
01:19:40 muck yeah dude a year in the past that i remember it this is four years ago and i've been watching
01:19:45 the whole time you know that's like t-bap era that we're getting to this point where like i'm
01:19:51 starting to be like oh yeah that analysis video i just watched was really good let's check when it
01:19:55 came out 2011 dude yeah yeah yeah no i feel the same way like i i still think of like um i still
01:20:03 feel like all the controversy about like the ghostbusters remake as like recent controversy it
01:20:07 was like three fucking years ago yeah that's yeah that's an ancient yeah so i know as we get older
01:20:14 time begins to accelerate our perception of time gets faster and we're gonna be 40 tomorrow
01:20:20 it's very distressing it's the worst we most of us are like rounding the corner 30 if not 30
01:20:25 already i'll be 30 in uh you know seven eight months or so that's the end of my life it's a
01:20:31 fate worse than death let me tell you i i believe you i believe you you're you're officially entering
01:20:36 the not cool period because like if you do something before you're 18 you're a prodigy if you do
01:20:41 something like in your 20s you're pretty cool anything from 30 to 60 it's like well of course
01:20:45 you're an adult it's just you're normal you're just you're at the age where you should be doing
01:20:49 things but then it swings back around if you're still like doing cool shit at 60 plus then you're
01:20:52 a badass old person so prepare for three decades of like nothing you do is anything other than
01:20:58 expectation and three decades of everyone just rolling your eyes at your bullshit and then of
01:21:03 course take the fact that you're a white cis male and then add that and it's just like so it's just
01:21:07 like it's a real you'll be lucky if you don't get the fucking guillotine the next 30 years
01:21:11 yeah by the by the time i'm an old white man old white men will be illegal and i'll be killed
01:21:18 immediately you know i was just saying the other day gib that you reminded me of a man who's
01:21:23 simultaneously 15 and 75 or something like that uh in the best way yikes wait wait i remind you of
01:21:32 that you you young at heart old of old of skeleton body riddle of bone and weak of mind
01:21:41 is the boomer mantra is that a fucking t-shirt i hear is that a fucking t-shirt i smell that's
01:21:51 good oh how about like a like a yes i'm a boomer and then it's like and then on the back it just
01:21:56 says big bold words brittle of bone weak or ask you about how i'm a boomer maybe with like the
01:22:04 word like censored because it's a bad or like like that sonic meme where it's like the letters
01:22:09 vertically and it's supposed to spell out an acronym it's like yes i'm a boomer brittle of
01:22:14 bone weak of mind all the other letters are empty something one of these will work yeah get back
01:22:22 to us artistic designer people with but wait wait what do you actually mean though i don't know you
01:22:27 just simultaneously you have the air of someone who's both 13 and 75 at the same time you just
01:22:33 restate it but what does that mean it's because you're explain yourself i don't know because you
01:22:37 have like a a slow gentlemanly disposition about you like an old man but also i don't know you are
01:22:44 a small because i like minecraft and i'm stupid uh yeah you're a 15 year old that talks to the
01:22:51 british accent so you must be refined that's definitely that's definitely an advantage in my
01:22:56 in my favor uh i i do i do enjoy being stupid and young at heart that is my favorite thing to be
01:23:05 so i'm glad that that comes across but also being smart being smart and being smart is really good
01:23:11 you talk like a man of a wizened uh disposition i guess i hope when i am 75 i still seem like
01:23:18 that that's my goal you'll be full uh hey fellow kids check out my skateboard no i'll i'll i'll be
01:23:25 playing the the hot new game minecraft patch minecraft 2 will finally be 50 years from now
01:23:34 what if everything was a sphere in minecraft 2 instead mine's mine's fear we finally have the
01:23:39 technology to make rounded corners yeah instead of crafting you sphere things
01:23:46 all right let's let's get to these voicemails over here it's we can't delay the inevitable
01:23:50 any longer um all right link down below people speak pipe you know what to do leave us quality
01:23:56 voicemails uh we'll we'll be kicked to the curb if it's some bullshit uh but we've got our first
01:24:02 boy up here uh it's just statistics uh let's let's hear what manner of statistics he has for us
01:24:08 okay go so nate definitely has something going on when he talks about the idea of one night is
01:24:13 and that being a big problem because let's say you have a question on someone and you wait
01:24:17 like a month to ask them out or whatever that's a month so you could have asked out a hundred other
01:24:22 girls right so what i did as a social experiment as a meme that's what i say but you know obviously it's
01:24:30 is i well when one week i asked out every single girl i had an interest in i socialized for like
01:24:35 one minute and then asked no are you single kind of thing and i got 20 rejections and four yeses
01:24:42 in one week and statistically there you go eventually they'll say yes you know if you're
01:24:48 on like a stupid like whiny bitch like oh please be my girlfriend i'm so sad that's not gonna work
01:24:55 if you just act like a human being and you're just being cool then eventually people will see it
01:25:01 people will think you're funny you know i i didn't take rejections like a big deal i was like hey
01:25:06 where's the shot and i like made flirty jokes because that's what funny people do and that's
01:25:12 all you have to do all yeah to get a girlfriend is this make yourself available and like tell
01:25:17 everyone i don't i don't know fuck maybe this isn't a good advice i don't know see there you
01:25:23 pretty good advice probably and i wait so this guy got four yeses does this guy have four girlfriends
01:25:29 now he's spinning plates like a good man should he sure indeed he should be these are not i don't
01:25:34 think they're full-fledged girlfriends i think he got four like sure i'd like to hang out yeah
01:25:38 something like that yeah yeah wait well that's not fucking worth anything just because they
01:25:43 say yes they're single i don't think he's saying that like i did it i bagged a girlfriend from nothing
01:25:48 i think he's saying that like he's crossed the threshold of being too afraid to even make that
01:25:52 step and now it's not a big deal anymore so i can go out and do it exactly exactly this way
01:25:57 it's making progress okay i'm just a little confused that like the goal of this exercise
01:26:02 was not to like ask someone to be your girlfriend or even to ask for a date but just to ask no are
01:26:06 you single no no no what he said was that he asked he was talking to a bunch of girls he asked 20
01:26:11 girls or whatever and most of them were taken but four of them said they were single and so he
01:26:17 proceeded to ask them out and they all rejected him that's what he's saying what he's saying oh
01:26:21 with this method no no he said he got 20 rejections and four yeses i thought the rejections
01:26:27 were four being single should we play it again real quick just to clarify can we play can we hear
01:26:31 that part again as i rewind this we're we're gonna skip okay just i have to play the beginning part
01:26:35 but just give it a second we'll get to the thing you can cut this out ellie is our the beginning
01:26:38 part if you want and i got 20 rejections and four yeses in one week and statistics okay that
01:26:48 he asked them out got 20 rejections but four yeses four people he asked out said if he would
01:26:54 have continued i think he wouldn't like what he said was like um and they can turn into girlfriends
01:27:02 or they can turn into like maybe he hasn't he's not going out yeah yeah you don't you don't start
01:27:08 with a girlfriend instantly you go out a few times okay but he got four he asked them out and he got
01:27:14 four yeses correct correct that's like four date equivalents four dates yeah something like that
01:27:20 yeah and then he and then all on the same day and he says hey girls and they were all like what the
01:27:25 fuck and and then you're part of a social experiment he had to he had to do a fucking uh mrs
01:27:30 doubtfire routine of running back and forth between each one okay but i think the takeaway here is
01:27:35 clearly boys uh man up and just don't just give it a shot man no one's gonna you know it's fine
01:27:41 it's cool just i'm wondering where like he sounds like he's in school still yeah yeah young and plenty
01:27:47 of access to 20 girls that yeah yeah under what sort of being strange when would there be like 20
01:27:52 girls around that is like hmm these are 20 out of all the girls i know i i can narrow it down to
01:27:58 these 20 that i might have some interest i would guess it's almost him it's in school but like better
01:28:03 to break the ice on a girl you don't want to go out with because when you get rejected you don't
01:28:08 feel bad about it it's like all right i just did it it's real it happened i i didn't die from the
01:28:12 question in the biz game started bitches yeah but why would you ask out a girl you don't want to go
01:28:17 out with because what is the idea is that if you're afraid don't if you're awkward around talking to
01:28:22 people like this is a way of like pushing you out of your comfort zone on and growing as a person
01:28:28 on the one hand i get that but like if she does say yes then you would just stand out with a
01:28:33 fucking shad look there's nothing wrong with going out with a girl and then saying to her later
01:28:38 like yeah you know we went out a couple times but you know i think that's okay but if you know
01:28:43 that you're not interested okay why would you even if you even if you get a yes doesn't that
01:28:48 it's not improve your confidence like if you're if you're someone who's in like in your shell like
01:28:52 in your bubble you you feel like you have no value whatsoever and that's why you're afraid to talk to
01:28:57 women and you talk to a girl and even if you're not interested she does want to go out with you
01:29:02 does that not like to someone in this position like wow maybe i'm not a complete fucking lost case
01:29:10 it does make it does it's not about the fucking girls like no one's right this is about training
01:29:16 your brain like test dummies or anything i'm just saying what isn't it weird it's weird to ask out a
01:29:22 girl that you're not interested in well it's the same way that people sometimes they apply for jobs
01:29:26 they don't want because it improves their like ability to uh do interviews and stuff and like
01:29:32 they become more confident as a person okay it's the same idea is it you get something out of a job
01:29:39 even if you don't like it you still get paid no like people will get accepted for jobs and
01:29:43 then not take them because they don't want to take them they're they're doing the interviews to get
01:29:46 better at yeah and and in that situation you're not hurting anyone's feelings yeah okay so you go
01:29:52 out and then you just say it doesn't work out what this is like the issue here what's the this is
01:29:56 like such a one in a million shot anyway because if you're like still trying to like struggle through
01:30:00 even making the sentence because you're socially awkward the chances of someone like yeah i like
01:30:05 autists let's do it like it's not it's small i mean even if it does happen that'll a give you a
01:30:10 confidence boost and b you can go out on one thing i have a weird coffee date and end it
01:30:15 awkwardly after that or maybe something good will happen who knows the point is that you're trying
01:30:18 to grow as a person and get better social skills and become more confident yourself how okay this
01:30:23 is a net positive it's a net positive for you i'm just i'm just like maybe i have too much confidence
01:30:30 in myself that i think it's not in one in a million like there's no chance that this could go wrong
01:30:34 like i think that there's there's a chance that if i talk to a go that i'm not interested in
01:30:39 into it for reasons of practice and she says yes interested in what do you mean by that what does
01:30:44 that mean well i don't want to go on a date with her okay don't do that that's dumb why would you
01:30:49 do that that doesn't make any sense well that's what i'm saying that's what i mean yeah there are many
01:30:53 many girls who okay well i guess i would just if that's what you're saying tom i disagree if you
01:30:58 like you you shouldn't ask someone out knowing you won't want to like some like someone you are
01:31:03 like have no interest in i don't know if you have nobody around you and you're just trying to develop
01:31:09 the social skill i think it's worth doing no well just just go out just like literally go walk outside
01:31:14 like to the supermarket there'll be a girl there just like sure but this is a this is a fucking small
01:31:19 case that probably won't all right if you're in that situation let me let me it's better to do it than
01:31:24 to not do it if you're fucking that socially autistic i suppose i'm saying that if you do
01:31:29 that if you if there's a girl that you have no interest in you do not want to go on a date but
01:31:33 you're lacking in self-confidence and you're like i'll ask her out and see if she says yes and you
01:31:37 ask her and she says yes i don't know if that isn't a positive because then you just i mean it's bad
01:31:42 for her because you're maybe she likes you and you're gonna stand her up you're gonna have to
01:31:46 reject her but like leaving that aside then you are just you just have this like weird social
01:31:52 obligation now that you have to meet you don't you won't enjoy it you don't want to do it and
01:31:57 are you is it really going to boost your confidence to know that you got a date with a girl that you
01:32:00 didn't even like it's about it's about getting i i guess like it's not a good thing to happen
01:32:07 but it's like it's a small bump in the road to getting to a better place mentally in my opinion
01:32:12 feel free to disagree i think i mean i understand you going to a place lying though tom isn't that
01:32:17 like telling a lie kind of asking a girl out who you don't yeah i guess it kind of is yeah
01:32:22 i guess it kind of is the thing the thing in my mind is just like if like she's the only girl in
01:32:29 the entire country sure but like that's my whole point is that like like this is like such a fringe
01:32:34 case that will probably never happen so i don't know why it's not hard to like find an attractive
01:32:39 woman i mean it's almost like it's a hypothetical thing it's like where are you gonna go where
01:32:44 there's like there's just nobody that you have any like interest in even like on a surface level
01:32:49 like it's that's my life okay well that's me your standards are pretty high then
01:32:53 that's my daily circumstances well i guess i stay in your house where there's just dudes okay okay
01:32:58 yeah that's right in case aside practically speaking like women exist around you you can
01:33:03 you can find one around that you have at least some desire to spend some amount of time with
01:33:08 and i would recommend trying on those correct correct just get out there and do something
01:33:14 please god yes that's the real takeaway okay next voicemail here we go this is from quality voicemail
01:33:21 oh right this person i put a note that they're the voice of the people uh this person is here to speak
01:33:26 on the subject of getting into voicemails uh okay i forget exactly do we need another one of these
01:33:32 well i remember this being decent so let me uh i don't know if i'm wrong let's judge me physically
01:33:39 all right let's let's here go so i create quality voicemails for you

01:34:01 yeah great that was awful that was okay i'm sorry i thought it was great in
01:34:10 was because i want to laugh at this person you are you are weak you are pathetic i have no
01:34:15 sympathy for you i put you on to be ridiculed i'd throw you in voice jail for something like this

01:34:40 sharing it on our voicemails we have some obligation to play your terrible sounding voicemail with your
01:34:46 shit audio quality shit personality and shit life uh nah nah you can you can go you can go take a jog
01:34:53 you can go jog well unless unless uh you know it does happen because nate wants to do this
01:35:01 well i mean this is the exact have any of his life stories i feel like you've done a number of
01:35:05 these things to to to bring something shit on so you could shit on it you set the precedent that
01:35:10 shit is a okay as long as you want to do it ironically i mean are they are they do the people
01:35:16 want to be on to be told how terrible their lives are i feel like some of them might get
01:35:22 some of the attention is good attention if you can't have fame you might as well have infamy
01:35:28 fair enough how many how many more voicemails do we have i think like four uh all right let's get
01:35:33 to the machine gun let's go go go go go here we go this is uh harlock aznebel uh he's called
01:35:38 oh yes all right let's uh let's let's here uh go hey guys guess what i just lost my virginity
01:35:46 yeah and you want to know how i did it uh how i did it i took nate's advice i went to anime club
01:35:53 no joe yeah i'm a great girl she can fucking speak fluent japanese oh yeah so she's essentially
01:36:00 perfect and then like we started hanging out and obviously i'm a shy little pussy bitch so i didn't
01:36:07 say anything but she essentially seduced me that's and it was just great it was great and you know
01:36:14 what else is great is she's bisexual so we both appreciate how awesome women are it's fun i like
01:36:19 cool it's so cool so cool i'm not i'm not a virgin anymore munchie so i can leave voicemails now
01:36:29 man you get lady anime club let me tell you there's some desperate hoes in there let me tell you
01:36:35 harlock harlock i just want you to reckon with the fact that you will go to your grave carrying
01:36:41 the shame of knowing that you lost your virginity during no nut november shake my fucking head
01:36:49 i just it's wrong it's tainted i i have difficulty wrapping my mind around the point of no nut
01:36:56 november if not to like pursue like okay i know i said this last time but like to me it seems like
01:37:02 the point of not fapping is to like encourage you to socialize no i think a lot of people do it
01:37:08 just spread the bragging rights of like self control i suppose it's to be it's to be morally pure
01:37:13 and to defend western civilization against degeneracy that's what it's about yeah okay sure
01:37:20 but wouldn't one component of the jews want us to fap tom but they want us to fap so that so that
01:37:25 black men can steal our white women and miscegenate the white race out of existence damn it i hate
01:37:31 you don't fucking believe me you've been fucking co-opted by the pedophile billionaires okay the
01:37:36 satanic cult all right bernie got you what about bernie though wouldn't having sex with someone to
01:37:43 you know be like child light or to you know be in the sphere sure obviously you're probably not
01:37:47 gonna have a kid but you're you're like closer to you know doing that than fapping know what i'm
01:37:52 saying i don't know no what i wasn't listening oh whatever who cares all right next voicemail here
01:37:56 we go please okay we're just checking in on uh this guy saying uh why no radcon for all right
01:38:01 let's let's let's hear his question okay i'm trying to be quick for just for nate so okay why isn't
01:38:08 there already a kickstarter for radcon for i mean it's been fucking millenials since the last one so
01:38:15 why give me reasons i need fucking reasons yeah quick update on that you you can blame me it's my
01:38:21 fault oh i mean is it yeah because i because i've been crippled and i wouldn't be able to go to it
01:38:26 so we weren't we're not sure when it was going to be able to be held i'm sure we would have fucked it
01:38:29 up and not done it anyway well the tom involvement was was one factor that wasn't everything or anything
01:38:35 but um beyond that you know we got it was the tom there was the tom factor there was the munchie
01:38:39 factor yeah the munchie and then there was the the location factor and also nate's moving potentially
01:38:44 to virginia i mean there's no hard plans so we could like that could be totally worked around in
01:38:50 many ways that we don't mean that doesn't matter that much but i mean we don't have a location
01:38:54 picture anything for it um we just we just haven't put uh any like real mental energy into picking
01:39:02 making any of the tough decisions that need to go into the thing like i mean i the the the current
01:39:07 status is there's there's a slight update which is just like at this point i i don't know if we
01:39:11 talk about this recently or not but like all the main obstacles of like we know people's availability
01:39:16 now we know the windows they might be somewhat limited and maybe take a little bit to get to it
01:39:21 but we know that we just need to like sit down and and hash out what we want to do where we're
01:39:25 going to do it you know how much money is going to be involved and if we kickstarter or any of that
01:39:29 stuff um and um also um there's there's a potential for kickstarter fatigue because digi said he was
01:39:37 going to do like a kickstarter for his uh light novel printing yes yes uh and you know oh he didn't
01:39:44 do that yet did he said he's gonna do that yeah i don't think he has we should beat him to the punch
01:39:49 maybe maybe they're not they don't have to do with us and not the other way around there's i mean
01:39:54 when it comes to kickstarter fatigue also part of the conversation of the of the can tent uh business
01:39:59 was there there is discussion of a can tent kickstarter to fund my move to virginia now there's
01:40:05 no we should just roll them into one and then have radcon forever you know we talked about why
01:40:11 that wasn't that maybe we talked to i think a while ago or not a while ago but like about
01:40:17 the idea of consolidating can tent kickstarter and um radcon for kickstarter but i think it was
01:40:25 unfavorably looked upon in general was it just like it was because i don't know how much it'll
01:40:30 fucking cost to move you well i mean the main expense over that yeah sorry sorry but like it's
01:40:36 just the main expense of that would like for me like i i've just been looking over like the numbers
01:40:40 and i think it's gonna cost me like roughly four thousand dollars what the fuck i don't even think
01:40:45 i own four thousand dollars worth of stuff i have to pay off my current lease well i mean like that's
01:40:51 how much money would be involved i have to pay off my current lease i have to then get a new lease
01:40:56 with the money down on that so like that's already like i thought you meant you just had four thousand
01:40:59 dollars in moving expenses i'm like how in god's name i'm trying to consolidate like all the fact
01:41:05 one number for that and then also like movements maybe buying new furniture or something like
01:41:10 four thousand to five thousand dollars is my estimate for that so like we've been talking
01:41:13 about like if we did like a kickstarter for content or mixed in with the pcb or whatever
01:41:17 like like a four thousand to five thousand dollar chunk i mean i would sure like to be
01:41:23 fundnates moving expenses and it's like how much sense does it make to put like that much
01:41:27 in a large pcb is it fair to put your moving expense on the people in the first place
01:41:34 well i mean that all depends if we can convince them that it's worth their money to make live
01:41:38 content i suppose then you know that's the pitch yeah that the idea was content would get its own
01:41:44 fan base and people would want nate to be able to move to digis quicker and so they would pledge
01:41:50 to that and once that's like locked and loaded then a radcon will be much easier to fund because
01:41:56 nate will already be wherever digis and if we do it there that seems more like a go fund me thing
01:42:02 than a than a kickstarter thing well okay we're just haven't discussed the old the other big factor
01:42:07 here which is how we will come up with like many specific productions that will be an integral part
01:42:14 like if you give us this money you will get these can tent productions i mean we just you and i mean
01:42:19 you know we haven't come up with that plan as you can see voicemailer there's a lot involved
01:42:24 in just like the logistics there's a lot that we haven't come to any agreement on like we might
01:42:28 want to it might make more sense to do it in boston as well but like you know who knows i think so
01:42:33 because three of us are here and only one or maybe two of us are going to be in virginia the x
01:42:39 factor on that whole thing is just like do we want to like could we theoretically cram ourselves
01:42:44 into digis place and like minimize costs by doing so would that mitigate the fly i mean i don't i
01:42:49 don't know i don't yeah i mean yeah obviously we should do wherever we can do it for the cheapest
01:42:53 we should do that's totally what i think that's all i care about like the the thing i was thinking
01:42:57 is um if nate is in virginia we might not you know i don't know how you would feel about people
01:43:04 sharing your house accommodation ways but like digis definitely fine with people staying over so if
01:43:10 we have you know that's like a few people at digis house maybe a few people at nate's house i mean
01:43:16 most of the expense of radcon three was renting the house right yeah the house itself was a large
01:43:21 part of like the production too though and uh i mean like how much i mean i've been to digis
01:43:27 house a bunch of times well like literally once in a while do you think it's big enough to host a
01:43:31 radcon four like theoretically yes but like to is it bigger than the place in brain tree was yes uh i
01:43:39 think so comparable sized maybe no it's smaller but there's a good amount of space there it's it's
01:43:45 comparably so it's smaller comparably size really because did you was saying it was bigger
01:43:52 well i don't know it's fine it doesn't matter it's just pretty big i don't know this is all
01:43:55 insider baseball that doesn't matter the viewers next voicemail go go go right okay well no that
01:44:00 they probably would love to be hearing all this radcon ideas oh shoot that was the best way to
01:44:05 get another get a radcon quicker is to give us more money that's not even alive yeah basically true
01:44:11 basically sure i mean in general uh all right we'll go to the next one uh what do we got here
01:44:17 this is from uh tio tio why tio oh i know tio tio yeah okay there you go i already i don't know how to
01:44:24 say it it's like it's like tio's the gif of my patrons it's just not happening okay and go so
01:44:32 listen to the last episode uh and uh nate starts talking about content you know the thing between
01:44:38 him and jit didgy and then he starts saying that uh he's designed to uh bring in as many as the pcp
01:44:45 members as you know they want at that at that rate why not just use the pcp channel it has a
01:44:53 oh right audience already there that's it all right that's enough of that i put that on because i
01:44:59 i don't know this i've heard some discussion of why is it just on the pcp there's i just for all
01:45:04 time here's the answer to that question it's because doing things on the pcp can sometimes
01:45:10 be a nightmare when you need to get everybody's permission and like you're putting videos
01:45:14 financial stuff it's all mixed up so fuck it we just split off new channel we're in charge of it
01:45:19 we'll do all the money managing ourselves no need to worry about what anybody else thinks
01:45:23 there's that's it there's your answer whatever uh good done out the kate next voicemail
01:45:31 this one oh okay my favorite voicemail of course here we go uh calling out ben saint
01:45:35 ooh it's time at long last uh we've been waiting for it he's been on a bunch of voicemails right
01:45:42 calling out ben saint or maybe or maybe it's just lots of people who want to do it i think i don't
01:45:47 think this is the same one as before but uh let's see okay okay go i'm not mad just disappointed in
01:45:54 you ben you were the one who introduced me to andrew yang this is all your fault yeah i knew it
01:46:03 you unfollowed him on twitter i can't believe you ben i unfollowed bernie too
01:46:10 ben ben sorry bro what the fuck i have i i think i've already explained that i was excited about
01:46:18 yang for a hot second there and then i fucking got my head out of my ass then unfollowing someone
01:46:23 is like a death sentence how could you do such a thing wait ben you unfollowed bernie as well
01:46:27 were you feeling the burn so hard you burnt out i just unfollowed all the politicians i was
01:46:32 fan that's a great idea it really don't i don't i don't need it i just it's fine i don't need it
01:46:38 oh my god i'm so i'm so proud of you're on the road to recovery no i've actually worse than ever
01:46:44 but it's always darkness before the dawn as they say i simply agree with what you and john said
01:46:49 in your uh in your podcast long ago that i just think having too much politics now there's maybe
01:46:53 more that i know is is better than what i'm doing but too much is probably a bad thing in my in my
01:46:58 humble it's yep every day yep any of that mm-hmm very upset very upset constantly uh okay next
