00:00:00 All right, so on this week's show I'm going to do something a little, I'm going to try
00:00:27 something a little different and if I don't like it or if it seems if it comes off as weird and
00:00:32 inauthentic then I'm going to stop you know before I get too far into this podcast. You know I've
00:00:39 been listening, I always listen back to the decompression chamber after I post it and the last
00:00:45 episode I enjoyed it, I enjoyed getting to decompress and like make all these points about myself and
00:00:51 but you know I feel like I've been on on the defensive a lot on this show and just in general
00:00:59 this show is it's always one of two things it's always either me talking about how great things
00:01:05 are going and all these like amazing plans I have or how awesome my life is or defending myself
00:01:12 or the way I've done something from either someone or I don't know from the world at large
00:01:20 I always feel like this this show is kind of self aggrandizing and you know I've the biggest
00:01:26 accusation I get all the time like the biggest criticism people have of me is that I have a
00:01:30 giant ego or that I'm uh or I'm arrogant and stuff like that and I it's it's weird for me hearing
00:01:38 those complaints because I don't really think of that as a problem like and I explained this on a
00:01:43 on a previous episode you know on the the decompression chamber how like that egos kind of
00:01:47 what keeps me afloat and what helps me to get through um and I don't really understand how ego
00:01:53 is a problem it's like I'm doing something I like and I'm enjoying myself and uh you know
00:02:00 like where where does it become bad for me I understand how it can be bad for for someone
00:02:06 else for the audience like I can understand how it could it could piss you off to listen to someone
00:02:13 be so like kind of smug and self-satisfied and enjoying themselves too much maybe um especially
00:02:20 if you feel like you're not enjoying yourself in the same way I get that I get it as a reason not
00:02:26 to like me but as a criticism like as a constructive criticism it's not helpful because the ego
00:02:33 is not damaging me at all it's not hurting me it's not hurting uh you know what I'm doing
00:02:38 so I want to talk about I want to criticize myself on this episode I don't know how well this is
00:02:43 gonna go I'm not good at it not because I'm so egotistical that I can't see my flaws but because
00:02:51 a for me when people talk about their problems um I don't know there's always something weird
00:02:57 about it it always comes off as kind of kind of fake and half-hearted it's like well you obviously
00:03:04 well you obviously you know I don't know how to fucking phrase this I'm bad at even talking about
00:03:12 the concept of talking bad about myself it's like these are these are thoughts that are kind of
00:03:16 internal to me you know it's like if I talk about a problem I have with myself then the question
00:03:21 becomes why am I not fixing it you know like if if it's something I recognize as an issue
00:03:27 then either people are going to tell me how to fix it or I already know how to fix it but I'm not
00:03:33 for some reason and it's like to me those this kind of things should are things you internalize
00:03:39 because you know as soon as you admit it you feel like you have to work on it or something and um
00:03:47 maybe that's like maybe that's what I'm getting at here maybe I'm afraid to work on these issues
00:03:53 or I feel like it's wrong to to brag about your problems you know to like to to be like huh I'm
00:03:59 so shitty you know it just comes off I was like well dude then fucking fix it you know if it's such
00:04:05 a big problem then why the fuck are you complaining about it on the internet as opposed to fixing it
00:04:10 but but at the same time I don't necessarily feel that way when other people complain about themselves
00:04:14 I do sometimes especially if people complain about themselves all the time that I'm just like
00:04:19 at some point I just kind of think well if all you if all you ever do is have this issue why are
00:04:26 you not putting everything you have into resolving this issue you know especially for people who have
00:04:31 more issues than not like if your life is nothing but you know self-criticism and and constantly
00:04:39 worrying about like how shit you are then how is your entire focus not trying to fix those elements
00:04:47 you know but but nonetheless I have I have things about myself that I like look I look at me and I
00:04:56 think god I fucking hate you for that you know I hate that you do that um and some of them some of
00:05:03 these things are not even things that I that I so much hate about myself because I enjoy doing them
00:05:09 like I enjoy being shitty in some ways I just know that it's it's bad of me or for me to do these
00:05:16 things so for instance one that comes to mind immediately uh because I experience this all the
00:05:23 time especially on procrastinators like either on the show or in the chat which is that I am
00:05:29 incredibly full of shit I am just absolutely full of shit um in like most arguments I get into
00:05:38 because I don't have many convictions I don't really like have a stance like a concrete stance
00:05:47 in the world that I'm like fighting for or arguing for I will just argue whatever side of an issue
00:05:54 is currently interesting to me you know or like if someone phrases something in a way that I find
00:06:02 questionable then I'll take the opposite stance you know just because I find what they said
00:06:09 questionable even if I don't even really care or I'm not really on that side this comes up a lot
00:06:14 when I argue with Nate where I'm not really arguing with Nate because I disagree with him
00:06:20 but because I don't like how he's framed his argument you know and you you'll hear this on
00:06:24 procrastinators all the time and it happens in the chat where we'll get into these long arguments
00:06:29 and then at some point he realizes that I don't actually disagree with like the overall point
00:06:37 he's trying to make I just hate how he's argued it and therefore at that point it all just like the
00:06:43 the discussion breaks down and it just becomes why the fuck are we arguing you know because I'll
00:06:48 argue all day because I don't mind arguing you know I'll keep I I just want I guess I have
00:06:56 more of a problem with language than I do with ideas you know like any idea can be presented
00:07:01 in a way that I'll end up agreeing with it if you if you word it correctly you know if if
00:07:07 if I understand where you're coming from and I and I think that the way you've presented the
00:07:11 idea makes sense which is why again I have that abradolph linkler mindset of just every every idea
00:07:18 makes sense to me it's just a matter of of putting it in the right terms you know there's very few
00:07:25 arguments that I like really have a hard line stance on like the idea that there is no objectivity
00:07:31 in art like that's one of the few things that I have always taken the same stance and will always
00:07:36 argue the same way but when it comes to social issues political issues just general discussions
00:07:45 especially discussions like about words and language I'll just play whatever side of the field
00:07:50 I find most entertaining to me at the moment you know and sort of derail things so here's an example
00:07:59 from today where I was sort of pseudo arguing with mumke in the pcp chat because mumke is now
00:08:07 officially a part of the pcp and um I think this was today it was over the fact that everyone in
00:08:15 the pcp has started showing interest in like uh making games in one form or another not not
00:08:21 literally everybody but a bunch of members like a bunch of people have been talking about uh game
00:08:25 ideas that they have going into 2017 and I was joking that 2017 is the year that we all start
00:08:31 making games and then Nate was talking about how you know he's made a game before and how it's
00:08:35 incredibly difficult and the all this stuff and I was like uh you know well the game I'm
00:08:41 positing uh is is you know incredibly simple like the whole idea of it is that it's simple
00:08:47 you play it with one button because it's not really a game and uh and like you know someone
00:08:53 asked like what's the gameplay and I said there is no gameplay and mumke was like it's not a
00:08:57 fucking game then and he came in with this argument about how it's like you know uh you've all heard
00:09:02 the game what is a game what isn't a game debate and like I have no stake in it I don't care either
00:09:09 way and the way I put it to mumke was like I argued with them for a little bit and I was literally
00:09:15 arguing both angles at the same time like I will simultaneously agreeing with him that it's not a
00:09:21 game but also disagreeing that the the definition of a game should be so limiting because I'm so
00:09:28 uninvested in it that I just I just want the argument to be presented in a sensical way like I
00:09:36 like to me giving a shit about whether like what is considered a game is like completely
00:09:42 retarded like I don't I think like even having that argument is like I could not possibly care
00:09:48 less about anything in the world and I don't think anything matters less in the universe
00:09:52 than like the label of what is or isn't a game who fucking cares because I'm very anti labels in
00:10:00 general I hate that everything is so like sequestered into mediums and genres and stuff when so much of
00:10:08 the best stuff out there is stuff that breaks those conventions and is like stuff that that is not
00:10:13 easily classifiable into you know into um categories like that I just generally hate labels and
00:10:19 categories but at the same time I do agree that it's not really a game like by standard definitions
00:10:26 of like like what is a game it shouldn't be called a game the thing I'm talking about so like
00:10:33 yeah I see it both ways and I can argue both ways and I'm only arguing because I think it's funny
00:10:40 and I'm totally full of shit so so I'm like literally arguing both sides of the field against
00:10:47 him and he was just like what like he was just like you know like fuck you you're a fucking idiot and
00:10:53 I'm like yeah I know like I know I'm being an idiot like I just I'm this happens all the time on
00:11:01 PCP like when I said something like uh how do you even know that I'm uh that I'm trying to speak
00:11:08 English in my videos you know like stuff like that where yeah of course I'm speaking English in my
00:11:16 videos but I'm just like I'm I'm broadening it out to like such a philosophical level just to
00:11:22 like win the argument and by for my like for me winning an argument doesn't mean proving I'm right
00:11:30 it just means like proving that being right doesn't matter that neither like like that that if you
00:11:35 argue something hard enough if you argue it to like a broad enough scale then it's all meaningless
00:11:41 you know that's like why I was such like a nihilistic mindset about everything because
00:11:46 you can kind of win every argument that way just like it only matters if you care and if
00:11:51 you don't if you if you bring the argument to a point where you make it apparent that you don't care
00:11:57 then it's all meaningless it all it all means it all just goes out the window and that's the way I
00:12:03 argue because I have no convictions I don't care about any side in any argument I don't care about
00:12:08 being right I don't care about like you know actually progressing the conversation I just care
00:12:15 about playing these little lingual games and you know and saying fuck it all and having any
00:12:21 stances lame like that's kind of how I end up spiraling my conversations
00:12:30 now I enjoy doing it so that's why it's a problem that like I don't know what the solution is
00:12:38 because I do think it makes me a total douchebag and it makes me impossible to talk to it's like
00:12:44 when you get to that point in the argument you're just frustrated and especially because
00:12:49 you know it always makes me look like the winner even if I'm not even if like you know in any
00:12:55 conventional sense of a debate I'm just making an ass of myself but there's never a sense of me
00:13:01 like admitting that I've lost you never get to a point where I'm like okay you've out argued me
00:13:07 because all I do is take the argument to such an extreme and broad place that there's no way to win
00:13:14 it's just over like you all I've done is removed the game out from under you you know um I've just
00:13:21 made myself above it all and even if you see me as like obviously wrong and and just a dick you know
00:13:31 it doesn't affect me it never makes me feel like I lost or feel like the bad guy you know and that's
00:13:37 why something like the pokemon race where you know the real drama is ben versus Nate in that race
00:13:44 right like Nate they both tried they tried really hard and they had a sincere you know dedication
00:13:51 the reason that that video is entertaining is because Nate tried so fucking hard that when he
00:13:57 lost it had a real gravitas to it but no one likes competing against me because I won't take it
00:14:05 seriously because if I did win I would of course lord it over everyone I would brag to the end of
00:14:13 the earth and I'd be like I'm the greatest guy ever but if I lose it doesn't matter because nothing
00:14:18 matters and I don't care about anything and I have no stakes in anything and and uh and it's all meaningless
00:14:25 so yeah I guess it's kind of like Nate was talking about how one of his in the in the
00:14:32 pokemon sun and moon podcast how he really hates the rival how because every time you beat how he
00:14:37 just goes like wow that sure was a fun match you know like we sure are buddy buddy pals and he's
00:14:43 like there's no sensation of victory from from like beating someone like that and that's me
00:14:49 that's who I am is that guy who when I lose it's like well you know playing games is for idiots
00:14:56 but when I win it's ha fuck you you lost um yeah and I think that just I think it makes me a total
00:15:06 douchebag and uh you know it's hard it's a hard thing to call someone out on so I think that's why
00:15:12 I've never quite been you know people get frustrated with me in the moment in things like that but it's
00:15:18 hard to express the overall problem of like why what like what is what is it that I'm doing that
00:15:25 you can sense I'm being a dick but you're not sure why this is why it's because I have this
00:15:31 affectation that nothing matters to me and and like and it's just a defense mechanism it's a way
00:15:38 to make it so you never have to feel aggravated or a sense of loss you know I never feel like
00:15:44 I've lost anything because I refuse to take anything seriously um but it also means that
00:15:52 you know when I taste victory it's only like it's always backhanded I mean I always feel
00:15:57 like a dick even when I win at something just because you know I only celebrate victories
00:16:03 that I was like bound to win anyways so I don't know uh yeah that's that point I guess that was
00:16:13 fun to talk about I think I rambled and repeated myself a lot but maybe you'll hear more about me
00:16:19 talking about why I'm a total dick in this uh the compression chamber
00:16:29 okay
00:16:35 all right I guess we'll mix this up a little we'll we'll jump back and forth between different types
00:16:40 of stuff in this this podcast this time it's gonna be more about a certain a certain fear of mine
00:16:46 I don't know if I'll call this a character weakness because it makes me sound like the
00:16:49 good guy in this scenario um whereas the last one was just me being a dick but uh it is a
00:16:55 it is sort of a weakness of character I guess um you know you often see this trope in media of the
00:17:06 character who um tries way too hard to be strong like someone who tries to take on the weight of
00:17:14 everything on themselves and to never crack and to always look like you know to try to be the rock
00:17:21 the person who never sheds a tear in front of anybody or shows any fear you know in front of
00:17:27 their crew so to speak because they're trying to hold everyone else together you know and there's
00:17:34 always this sort of this the sense of almost fear um that that person is one day going to
00:17:41 snap under the pressure that they're not that like all that all that strength and resolve you know
00:17:48 they eventually the hardships they're facing will eat away at them and it'll just break them
00:17:55 you know and sometimes these characters are presented as heroes and as the strongest people
00:18:00 sometimes are the ones who you're the most concerned about and usually there's you know what
00:18:07 what holds these people together is that there's someone that they find that they can show their
00:18:14 real insecurity to that they can break down in front of you know I'm thinking the first thing
00:18:19 that comes to mind when I think of this you know it's not quite a perfect example because this
00:18:24 character kind of flies off the handle would be in arreca seven when you have uh uh what's his name
00:18:31 you have talho and the guy the guy who holland who uh you know both of them are sort of inauthentic
00:18:42 around everyone else but you know like because because holland's always putting on this this
00:18:47 character of being this like larger than life figure but when he's with talho he can emote
00:18:52 and have those moments where he just kind of breaks down and um you know there's a lot of
00:19:01 characters like that in media and I'm always afraid that I might be one of those people
00:19:08 and I realize that because I'm comparing myself to a heroic trait then this sounds like you know
00:19:14 this sounds like egotistical self aggrandizement but I I don't know that it's that the people around
00:19:21 me are weak or that I just perceive everyone is weak you know because I'm so egotistical I feel
00:19:28 like I'm supposed to be stronger that I'm supposed to present myself as someone who is flippant and
00:19:35 doesn't care and is is unaffected it doesn't get emotional and never feels you know hardship
00:19:42 because everyone around me seems to be dealing with worse you know and I always feel like I have to
00:19:51 be the one person who is not complaining you know the one person who is doing okay so that
00:19:58 everyone else feels comfortable like like you know we're not all on a sinking ship someone
00:20:04 steering it upward you know and I want to look like that guy I don't even know how much I do
00:20:10 look like that guy you know and I I do know that like for for the pcp you know Nate has often said
00:20:18 for instance that he sees me as sort of like you know a beacon of of hope that this group is going
00:20:23 to do well because I'm succeeding so much and I seem to be having such a good life that it's like
00:20:28 we can all do it you know um and I want that I want to look that way but there are lots of things
00:20:36 that you know that bother me that are that are that go wrong or that I just feel emotional so
00:20:41 there's oftentimes you know several days in a row where I just feel like total dog shit and just
00:20:48 and don't even want to you know deal with anything and this decompression chamber is helpful for that
00:20:58 and that's kind of part of why it started because again as I've said in previous episodes um you
00:21:04 know the sort of incentive to have a show where it's just me is that there is no none of the
00:21:09 putting on airs that comes from talking to another person there's none of the turning myself into
00:21:15 someone else and it's not that I'm always completely vulnerable to my audience but um and it's it's
00:21:23 it's funny too because I know that most of the people I'm talking about who I try to be strong
00:21:28 in front of listen to this show anyways you know um so this is kind of an admittance to everyone
00:21:36 in those people probably again I don't think anyone sees themselves as relying on me or possibly
00:21:43 is relying on me you know maybe no one is you know it's just how I feel like I have to be
00:21:49 and part of it I would say this this sort of mindset originated from my teen years because
00:21:54 of the fact that I am the eldest of three brothers and my dad is exceedingly strong
00:22:02 he like me puts on that character of like everything will work out and part of the reason
00:22:10 for that is that my mom you know while she is a very you know tough person she is comparatively
00:22:18 in terms of like emotions she's very emotional you know she will be worried very intensely
00:22:24 worried she's very pessimistic she's very um you know if things are going wrong she expects them to
00:22:31 go very wrong and my dad has always been someone who's constantly reassuring her he's always playing
00:22:38 the oh it's not that bad it's gonna be okay I know what I'm doing I know how we can get out of this
00:22:42 you know my dad always has that optimistic mindset just to counterbalance my mom's pessimism
00:22:49 and when I reached a certain age I realized that I too have to do that for my mom you know because
00:22:59 she will become concerned if me or victor or shade you know if it seems like things aren't
00:23:05 going well for us or if we're concerned about something you know it it becomes almost a bigger
00:23:11 concern for her than it ever was for me you know so I won't talk about hardships my mom even though
00:23:17 I know she wants me to I know she would want me to and she would want to help but I feel like
00:23:24 things that I can deal with that like are that aren't that big a deal to me become a bigger deal
00:23:32 both for me and her if I tell her you know so I won't say anything I'd rather come to my dad who
00:23:39 is you know who will who will be able to deal with it you know but even him the problem with my dad
00:23:45 is that there's just too many problems he has a difficulty understanding and he has his like you
00:23:50 know he's the type of person to like give advice and it kind of expect you to take that advice even
00:23:56 if you know to me it's like well I know what I'm doing you know I'm just here to vent I don't I
00:24:03 don't I don't know I don't have an easy time venting to my parents I've never been able to
00:24:07 tell them about anything going like wrong with me um not because they're not you know they're
00:24:12 totally there for me I just personally would rather keep it to myself you know because I don't feel
00:24:18 like um like worrying them will help me more I feel like I should deal with it you know and then
00:24:25 I've also got two little brothers who you know I wanted to be a role model for who I wanted to be
00:24:32 strong for so I you know again have always put on that face of like being a leader I've always been
00:24:38 the leader of my brothers you know they've they've followed me through whatever I've been doing all
00:24:45 these years you know um we're always very close they're always right right behind me and I've
00:24:50 always been sort of a leader amongst you know friends I have and stuff like that I've always
00:24:55 been someone who constantly reassures everyone and and unlike my dad who does it with this sort of
00:25:02 brazen manly confidence my dad's just like you know he's a man of the house kind of guy he's the
00:25:09 kind of guy who's like you know this is what we're gonna do and it's gonna work and we're gonna do
00:25:13 it and he's very confident I on the other hand approach everything in a much more sarcastic way
00:25:22 where to me it's more about my dad suggests like believe in me because I know what I'm doing and
00:25:32 I will get it done for me it's more like um you're silly to be thinking of like this is a problem
00:25:41 like I constantly make people like I make people out to be overreacting anytime they're they're uh
00:25:48 they're complaining about something I always make it out like of course things are gonna work out
00:25:53 you know like yeah no shit everything like everything's good everything always goes well
00:25:59 you know if you just give it time everything always goes well like that's the way I present
00:26:03 things as if that's a given and like I think DeVu is the person who's called me out on this the most
00:26:10 because the fact that I like you know he is often like has problems with things that I'll just be
00:26:17 like eh you know if you just give it like five minutes it'll work and then like it doesn't work
00:26:22 and he's like you always say that's gonna work it you know you're like you're wrong like half the time
00:26:28 but like because I I I approach everything in this way that I'm just like eh you know everything
00:26:34 always works everything's good the world makes sense you know um that's just my way of reassuring
00:26:42 people like trying to make them feel like uh like nothing's nothing's ever that big a deal
00:26:50 whatever thing you think is a big deal it's actually not a big deal and everything makes
00:26:54 sense and it's all gonna work you know um that's just kind of my approach to life and
00:27:02 to to bring that back a little bit to like you know what I was initially talking about just
00:27:08 I feel like I constantly have like I'm constantly putting on this persona of like
00:27:14 everything goes perfectly for me everything makes sense and flows in a logical manner and um
00:27:24 you know I I know that like DeVu really likes in spite of the fact that he calls me out on the
00:27:28 way I approach you know uh the other thing like he's he's very much about the idea that like if you
00:27:36 exude confidence then the confidence will come you know like if you're if you're always thinking
00:27:41 that you're doing things right then you'll end up doing things right and uh and I kind of act the
00:27:47 same way but I have I have doubts about it you know like things aren't always perfect for me
00:27:54 things aren't always great things aren't always working out sometimes I just I'm just like I
00:28:01 don't know what the fuck I'm doing you know I have no idea what I'm doing with my life or
00:28:05 I'm just I'm just angry or anxious or bored or like just upset about something and I never feel like
00:28:15 there's someone I can talk to about it because if I do then it breaks the charade it breaks the
00:28:22 image it breaks the idea that you know that there is someone who's doing it all right and that like
00:28:29 you know I I sort of want to be this symbol of like what you're all hoping life can be
00:28:35 you're all hoping you can live your dreams and you can do art and make money and be happy
00:28:41 you know and I don't want to suggest to you that even after all that effort and all that work
00:28:48 it's still gonna be shit like half the time because you're just a fundamentally broken person
00:28:54 who has you know problems with addiction and you're not satisfied with your body and you never
00:29:01 leave the house and you you know you never get laid at all for years on end and you know
00:29:10 and you sit around and drink alone and sometimes stare into space all day and the only sense of
00:29:18 accomplishment that you ever feel is when you throw together random 10 minute vlogs
00:29:22 and you're so self-satisfied about your own content that you'll put something out you know
00:29:27 every single day and feel like you're getting something done when all of it is just like
00:29:32 pennies in the ocean of actually accomplishing something when you could be if you put your
00:29:38 mind to it like putting out you know like more mainstream content that you know everybody
00:29:45 wants and you know you could make and it would make you more money and it would help out you
00:29:49 and all your people and you'd be moving way faster towards anything you wanted more money better
00:29:55 place you know getting all your fucking friends down here but because you're so stuck in this
00:30:00 this mood driven mindset where all you do is you just I'm just talking about myself by the way
00:30:07 I don't know why I'm still in the second person but like maybe it was just easier to rant about
00:30:13 that if I'm talking if I if I pretend it's not me but you know I I'm so governed by moods I'm so
00:30:20 impulsive I just want to do whatever is interesting to me right now and I never want to do anything
00:30:27 that's like takes setup or time or work or effort you know the reason I put out videos every day
00:30:33 is not because I have an amazing work ethic in fact it's pretty much the opposite the reason I
00:30:38 put out videos every day is because I just attach myself to every flight of fancy that I have and I
00:30:44 just want to do that and that works decently for me because people do watch those videos and enjoy
00:30:49 them and that's great but I could be if I set my mind to it making stuff that everyone would enjoy
00:30:58 all the time you know I could be having a video every third day on the digi bro channel you know
00:31:05 with a hundred thousand to five hundred thousand views and that would be growing at such an exponential
00:31:11 rate if I had videos coming out that frequently of that level of quality so many people would start
00:31:16 tuning in that I'd have way more ad revenue way more patreon money devout get a raise devout would
00:31:22 have a car you know my friends would be able to we'd all be fucking moved in somewhere you know
00:31:27 and doing these things that we've been talking about that we've been slowly making progress
00:31:31 towards for years but because none of us just buckles down and just does the fucking thing
00:31:37 you know we we all kind of like slowly get it done while we pussyfoot around and procrastinate and
00:31:43 you know worry about other shit that we haven't just like just buckled down and made the thing
00:31:49 because we're all flawed people who can't just do that you know none of us has the mindset to just
00:31:57 become a purely engine of success and I keep painting myself like one I keep making it look like
00:32:03 hey you know someone's at least got their stuff together enough that they're they're still rising
00:32:09 through the ranks you know I'm making I'm doing it but I could be doing so much better and you know
00:32:14 and of course I agonize about it every day every day that I you know when I fucking spend a week
00:32:21 what the fuck have I done this week I don't know and I know it's because it's a holiday season but
00:32:25 this is why vacations freak me out and I shouldn't take them anytime I'm like I'm just gonna not do
00:32:31 work for a week then at the end of that week it doesn't matter what the reason is that I didn't
00:32:35 do work for that week it doesn't matter that I was hanging out with family or that I was like
00:32:40 trying to take a sabbatical or that's like oh we have enough work done there's no reason to do more
00:32:45 except that there's always a reason to do more because if you do more then more will come out of
00:32:51 it that's why Casey Neistat has the do more tattoo on his hand and the work harder tattoo on his arm
00:32:57 because he sees those and he goes you're right I should just work it doesn't matter that I don't
00:33:03 have to you know complacency will kill you it killed him he talks about that you know how there
00:33:08 was a two-year period where he didn't do shit because he had two million dollars from selling
00:33:12 his show to HBO and it made his life miserable it was the worst he felt because he wasn't working
00:33:18 you know and every time I take a week off and I don't work and I look back at it I'm just like
00:33:23 what the fuck am I doing why am I why I don't care about the fucking holidays why am I sitting
00:33:29 around for five days drinking and fucking making vlogs about my dream anime stuff that comes into
00:33:35 my head like out of nowhere and I make a vlog and then I feel satisfied well I made a video
00:33:39 today so what does it matter yeah I could I could I could be done with the next part of
00:33:44 shaft uh studies you haven't even started on the next video yet I could be done with it I could be
00:33:51 probably I think I could be done with it yeah I could be done with that if I've been working
00:33:54 on it this whole time since finishing writing shinbo in the 2000s um you know I could be started
00:34:00 on the next thing I could be using this this last week of the year to write uh you know videos for
00:34:07 all of january to have ready for devu so he has work so he knows what he's doing you know
00:34:14 um so we don't start january with this whole clusterfuck of the goddamn plebe in the weave and
00:34:18 then who knows what my channel ends up being for the rest of the month oh god
00:34:24 that was too much decompression you unzipped me me
00:34:45 this might end up being a longer decompression chamber because I'm still in the same night
00:34:50 and I'm already on a third recording so uh you know I don't know how long this might go on for
00:34:57 but I want to expand a little bit on the idea of complacency and also to share one of the
00:35:04 the pieces of advice I've gotten that stuck with me the most out of anything I've ever heard
00:35:10 you know sometimes you have those those things that someone says to you or I mean I don't know
00:35:15 if you have this but I've I've had a few of these instances where someone said something that like
00:35:19 just has replayed in my mind forever and this one by far the most um so just because it's
00:35:27 remained true over all the years which is that I was talking to ghost lightning once my friend who
00:35:35 I've often described as my mentor fellow anime blogger who um who I visited for a time in the
00:35:41 Philippines in 2011 and uh we were talking about probably some project I was trying to do like
00:35:49 some you know I was probably telling him about some idea I had that I wanted to get off the ground
00:35:54 but that I was like probably bitching about how I wasn't doing it and um honestly sometimes I'm
00:36:01 shocked by the level of patience that ghost lightning had with me because it's a level of
00:36:05 patience that I wouldn't have had like that current me would not have for a like 18 year old
00:36:13 complaining about the things that I would complain about um you know with the lack of
00:36:17 self-awareness but I I'm sure I was bitching about something and I about how I was not in the mood
00:36:26 to do it and he like like really hit me hard with his line he was like you always let yourself
00:36:35 be controlled by these moods and like you need to stop that like I don't remember exactly the
00:36:41 phrasing but the advice was to stop letting myself be controlled by my mood and it was like mind
00:36:48 blowing to me because I never thought about that that that's like a thing that you have to fight
00:36:53 like that like what it means to me in many ways what it means to be an adult or to be like mature
00:36:59 and to be able to like handle your scandal as the phrase goes um is the ability to work through
00:37:09 what you don't feel like doing you know to do it anyways even though you don't feel like it because
00:37:16 it's necessary or it's the right thing to do or it will you know benefit you that to me is like
00:37:22 that's the entire definition of what it means to be like you know uh to be um to be an adult who
00:37:30 gets things done because I mean that's entirely what work is you know work is when you do a thing
00:37:39 you don't want to do because you understand the long-term benefits of it and uh you and you know
00:37:46 can make progress and you know in the time since then I mean it was a while before I that that advice
00:37:53 like haunted me but I did not beat that for a long time you know I did not get past that problem of
00:38:00 having you know just letting my mood completely control me because I would if you know I would
00:38:05 only do things I was in the mood for and like I would be in certain moods for days on end or just
00:38:10 like very rarely actually be in the mood to get something done so you know it was a big problem
00:38:16 that I would let myself be so controlled by whatever mood I was in and I've I've learned how
00:38:22 to beat that I now know how to put like to say to override my mood and just fucking do something
00:38:30 and the funny thing about moods easy to change it's it's it's actually like you know you can
00:38:37 be in a mood you can be in like a rut you can be think like I'm bored and upset or something and
00:38:42 you can stay that way all day but if you actually flip the switch in your mind where you realize
00:38:48 like I can change this then it's it's pretty easy to do for me it's often a matter of just
00:38:53 throwing on the right music and like getting out of my chair you know I've had days where I'm like
00:38:58 sitting there for hours just like just kind of you know ruminating on something negative and
00:39:03 just being in a shit mood and then like I realize I'm listening to depressing music and sitting in
00:39:10 a chair and you know and eating cheese balls all day and then like at some point I go wait let's
00:39:16 stop this and I just like throw on some onomatoguchi and get up and like do some push-ups or go for a
00:39:23 walk or go eat something and I come back and I feel completely different you know you can do things
00:39:29 to affect your mood and oftentimes just working through it will make you feel better just like
00:39:35 for me actually getting something done always feels good it doesn't matter like sometimes
00:39:40 I get something done and I feel great and then I immediately going back to feel like shit as soon
00:39:44 as I'm not working again but like working on something always feels good it's always a pick
00:39:49 me up you know I'm never sad when I'm doing a decompression chamber because I'm recording
00:39:54 you know I'm having fun making a recording so you know that at least an hour out of my week
00:40:00 that I'm recording this podcast is a time I'm feeling pretty fine you know and sometimes
00:40:05 the result of that can change how I felt from before especially if I've just made something
00:40:10 that's actually like really beneficial like anytime I write a digi bro video I feel great
00:40:15 afterwards because it's like um sometimes they come out of nowhere it's it's you know I feel
00:40:21 like shit all day and then suddenly I finally get an idea that I really want to do and I do it and
00:40:26 it's like this has made my whole month because you know I only really have to have a video every week
00:40:34 and if even if I spend like two days completely agonizing over getting the video like you're
00:40:42 coming up with an idea that I want to do and it's like just sucks those two days are grueling
00:40:47 and then I write that video on the third day then that weight is gone it's like oh now I've
00:40:53 saved the week and the rest of the week is fine I don't feel that pressure anymore you know like
00:40:58 accomplishing things and working can be so you know can really get me out of those moods and um
00:41:04 so I still am someone who lets myself be governed by moods a lot but I know how to fight it but the
00:41:08 problem is that I face now is complacency and I really do think that like when people talk about
00:41:19 complacency it sounds so phony right to hear someone who's like successful say that like
00:41:26 that success can be a problem but it really can because hunger and like desire for more
00:41:34 is such a huge motivating factor to like it really pumps you up and like makes you want to keep
00:41:40 working and again working is the best feeling I have you know it's the thing I want to do the most
00:41:45 I feel lazy when I'm not working I feel shitty when I'm not working I feel like I'm not going
00:41:50 anywhere like my life is stagnating and nothing's really happening you know it's only when I'm
00:41:56 accomplishing more than I have already done that I feel you know reignited either in the form of
00:42:03 making more money or feeling like I'm making creative progress like I'm getting better you know
00:42:08 those are the best feelings but when you're complacent it's when you realize that yeah you could be
00:42:17 getting better you could be making more money but you don't have to that's the danger that success
00:42:25 can bring is when you don't have to so you you just you think well it doesn't matter if I just do
00:42:33 whatever I'm in the mood for it doesn't matter if I spend all day you know being a shit because I
00:42:39 know by the end of the month I'll get those videos written you know at some point this month I've
00:42:44 got to have a huge burst of creativity where I write four videos in a short span of time and
00:42:51 that's all I really need you know it's enough to make the money to keep the channel growing to keep
00:42:55 me but it's not progress it's stagnation and when these periods happen when I have like
00:43:03 times where I don't really care about what's going on it tends to even though the same amount of
00:43:09 stuff is coming out you know I don't feel like it's getting better and it's not necessarily the money's
00:43:14 not going up you know you can tell at times when I'm very passionate when I'm like really getting
00:43:20 things done it seems like I make more money even though there's no real logical reason for that to
00:43:25 be the case and maybe I'm wrong maybe it's just the way I look at the statistics depending on my
00:43:30 mood just feels that way you know and it feels like like I'm not getting anything done when I let
00:43:36 myself be lazy when I let myself go uh you know I already wrote the videos for this month so rather
00:43:44 than writing the ones for next month or rather than writing something even bigger and better rather
00:43:49 than getting a new thing done and expanding on my creativity I'm just gonna sit around you know
00:43:55 because I can why not but that's the thing sitting around makes you feel like garbage
00:44:03 these meat makes me feel like garbage makes me feel like nothing's happening makes me feel like
00:44:07 I'm not doing anything like I'm just stagnating like I'm getting worse as a person or or remaining
00:44:12 the same you know um this is what happens to me with like diet and weight loss and and quitting
00:44:20 things like the reason I keep going back to smoking um you know I bought a pack of cigarettes
00:44:26 yesterday just because I had a like what always happens is I think why do I have to stop like
00:44:34 nothing is making me stop the only reason to stop is this vague sense that I'll be better if I do it
00:44:42 you know but there's no there's no actual pressure to there's no pressure to stop eating out so much
00:44:48 there's no pressure to eat better to to look better to feel better you know all logically I should
00:44:55 just want those things but because I'm already like I'm already meeting my own demands for success
00:45:02 I don't feel like I have to do any of that who cares why do I need to look better why I need to
00:45:06 feel but then you know but then at the end of the day I'm sitting on my couch for hours at a time
00:45:14 going like I have no social life I feel kind of sickly and fat you know I'm not eating well
00:45:23 I feel wrong I feel imbalanced my head hurts because I've been smoking too much you know
00:45:29 and all of that is what puts me into the mindset of like well you know I gotta numb this somehow
00:45:36 let's either you know take a couple Advil or take drink as many beers as I can you know and then
00:45:41 and then drinking feels great but then there's that moment when you're drunk and then you can't
00:45:46 get anything done and you're like well now I'm useless so I guess I'll just go to bed and then
00:45:52 sleep for you know 12 hours every fucking day complacency is dangerous and you know I think a
00:46:01 lot of people view their vision of what success is is like you reach this level and then it's a
00:46:11 plateau from then on of happiness but there is none of that because if you plateau you become
00:46:17 unhappy the second you stop fighting is when you lose your drive to become better and to to keep
00:46:26 being good it's when you you you kind of realize the bare minimum you have to do and you just decide
00:46:33 to do that and that's when you stagnate and I'm not saying this is all happening to me because
00:46:40 the only reason I feel any of this stagnation is that my life is so open-ended and I work so fast
00:46:48 that's the only reason this happens because if you look at like the content I'm putting out you're
00:46:52 like well wait you're trying new things all the time you've got like all these new series you keep
00:46:56 opening up you know after dark so it's doing new things you've got all these you know new things
00:47:01 going on in digi bro where's where's the stagnation well the problem is that all that stuff only takes
00:47:09 up a small part of my day you know the amount of time I spend working on these videos and stuff
00:47:15 that's like a few hours the day is 24 hours long every day is a long day you know I sleep probably
00:47:21 10 to 12 hours of those so like you know it's not not as long but the time that I'm not making these
00:47:29 videos or consuming anime for these videos or like doing research is time I'm not doing anything
00:47:37 that's the stagnation time I do not monopolize my time well you know and like Casey Neistat with his
00:47:44 do more and work harder if you watch that guy's video about his fucking schedule he's never not
00:47:51 doing something never you know he's always either working or making movies or spending time with his
00:47:59 family or uh or you know traveling or doing whatever and he he works even when he travels
00:48:05 like on planes and stuff he only sleeps like four hours a night uh he's always you know he
00:48:11 works out every day he runs consistently he's always happy healthy and working harder and getting
00:48:16 better all hours of day you know so even though yes I still work enough to innovate I still do
00:48:25 enough to make progress because I can work so fast and I get things done so quickly
00:48:32 because I'm like a fucking engine I'm just a machine that cranks out stuff
00:48:37 nonetheless there's a lot of every day that is just sitting around feeling wrong you know
00:48:46 and that's the part of me that I have a problem with that's harder to communicate to people
00:48:54 and it's harder to be like to make people understand that like
00:48:59 being satisfied with with with my career does not mean that I'm satisfied with my life because I
00:49:08 know I could be doing more and doing better and not letting my mood control me you know fucking 10
00:49:16 hours out of the day well it's been almost a month since I recorded the first 50 minutes that you
00:49:30 just listened to of this podcast I recorded it at the end of December and I spent a lot of time
00:49:36 really deliberating about whether or not I was going to release it whether I was going to continue
00:49:41 the episode a big part of me just wanted to delete it not let it see the light of day
00:49:47 because I just I feel so weird about talking about these things and you know
00:49:57 listening to it back I couldn't help but feel like somehow I came off as even more arrogant
00:50:03 and self aggrandizing when complaining about myself than I ever do when bragging about myself
00:50:09 it's quite incredible but I ended up deciding I wanted to post this particularly when I came
00:50:16 up with this last section I wanted to record this for the last like week or so and I finally have
00:50:23 time now that rad cons fully over and I've had a day to sleep and do stuff so I want to talk about
00:50:33 the hedgehog's dilemma as described in Neon Genesis Evangelion something that connected
00:50:40 with me very strongly back when I watched the show and which still does which is the idea that
00:50:46 you know when two hedgehogs try to get close to one another they end up stabbing each other
00:50:53 with their pins and the closer they get the more it hurts and so they just try to avoid people
00:50:59 altogether I think this is generally true of human relationships the closer you get to someone
00:51:07 the more it's going to hurt you and I feel like the more aware of that you are the scarier it
00:51:14 becomes I think most people are able to form relationships because they mostly see and focus
00:51:19 on the good you know even though they might fight with someone or or have problems with them
00:51:25 they really you know internalize the idea that they they love the person or they're close to them
00:51:35 and I try to do that as best I can but I always have this the sensation when it comes to
00:51:43 you know with with other people of like I I kind of how about I put it this way I feel
00:51:53 the pins going into me and I don't make any sound I don't scream you know I don't tell them
00:52:01 that it hurts I just let them get closer and I feel the pain and I don't say anything I just
00:52:09 eventually turn and go the other way I just eventually leave all at once and um you know
00:52:19 this is a big problem in my life in general and what I'm trying to rectify and that was an extreme
00:52:27 example of of me taking this kind of action but let me let me break it down in a in a more simplistic
00:52:32 way I have some friends who when you let's say get into a fight with them or if there's something
00:52:39 they disagree with you on fundamentally some of my friends will just let it roll off of them
00:52:45 they might form a general opinion of you like you know if you repeatedly piss them off
00:52:52 then they generally think that guy pisses me off but they don't think about the individual reasons
00:52:58 why I want to say that Nate is like this you know he doesn't ever seem to bring up like hey when you
00:53:05 did this that pissed me off he can if pressed but he will more have a general idea of like you've
00:53:12 pissed me off in this way a bunch of times you know but but not really focus on the specifics too much
00:53:19 then I have friends who will get pissed off about very specific things and will let you know
00:53:25 they will tell you they will hold it against you then is a good example of this you know you'll
00:53:31 have heard it on the pcp he will hold a grudge about specific things and he will keep reminding you
00:53:37 of that thing until you've done something to rectify it or to placate him now I I don't know how
00:53:44 many other people are like this I'm sure everyone is on some level but this is generally how I operate
00:53:50 is that I get mad about specific things and I stay mad about them but I don't say anything
00:53:57 I just bottle it all up I just can because I don't want to me the best way to deal with it is to just
00:54:05 let it go right if we keep arguing about it we're just going to keep getting more heated
00:54:11 but at the same time what I'm failing to realize is that you know some things can actually be resolved
00:54:18 sometimes an infraction can be talked through and reach a conclusion and that's what I'm trying to
00:54:24 do more of I'm trying to you know bring up when I have an issue because I have this tendency to
00:54:32 just sit back and accumulate all these different little incidents or someone's making me mad
00:54:39 and I don't tell them just how mad those incidents have made me it just builds up and builds up and
00:54:45 I've got this this list and I'll tell other people you know I'll be like I can't believe what this
00:54:52 guy said to me today you know and tell them the story but I don't bring it up to people's faces
00:54:58 this is true of absolutely everyone if you're listening to this and you're thinking he's
00:55:02 talking about me I am because I'm talking about everyone I know anyone who does anything that
00:55:07 makes me mad I keep tally I've got them all in my mind and I've told other people about the things
00:55:14 that you've done that made me mad but I probably haven't told you and you'll know if I have
00:55:21 because again I'm trying to rectify this I'm trying to become someone who lets you know
00:55:26 you know when I've got a problem and tries to resolve it and tries to come to terms with it
00:55:30 because I've been so bad at that in the past and what I basically have done with some people
00:55:35 in my life is just let all those little things accumulate until I just cut ties you'll remember
00:55:43 on a previous podcast I talked about my friend D I just called him D this was a guy who was a part
00:55:51 of my circle of friends and over time everyone developed a problem with him everyone I knew
00:55:59 had an issue with D because just he would constantly do things that made everyone pissed off
00:56:07 it was just like a never-ending cycle every time we saw him he would do something to make someone
00:56:12 mad and it got to a point where me and my friends would literally just sit around and shit talk D
00:56:20 all day it was like the number one thing we did as a group was to talk about how much this guy
00:56:26 pissed us off and the reason we did that is because D was the kind of person who you could not
00:56:31 like make realize his faults you know and if you did if you brought something up if you
00:56:37 made him realize that he defended you he would apologize and he would try to do something for
00:56:42 you but I don't I don't want that I don't want people trying to do things for me I just want
00:56:47 you to recognize that you've done something wrong and then to not do it again but D's not like that
00:56:53 he would do it again you know he would he would never recognize what the mistake was he would
00:56:58 think he fucked up in that instance and try to rectify that instance without realizing that he's
00:57:04 just doing the same mistake over and over again now obviously D is someone who you know I'm probably
00:57:12 better off without having him in my life but so long went by that I just didn't even confront him
00:57:19 and I would just sit back and cowardly wait for someone to do it I just wanted someone to finally
00:57:26 snap on him and give me an excuse to ride that wave and just you know have him out of my life
00:57:33 for a while we thought it was gonna be my mom of all people because you know all my friends hung
00:57:37 out at my house and D had done enough things that pissed off even my parents that my mom had straight
00:57:43 up said like if he does one more thing that pisses me off I'm kicking him out and I literally
00:57:50 hoped that it would happen I spent like days just thinking God I hope he fucking does something
00:57:56 that pisses off my mom so she'll kick him out and I won't have to you know because I wouldn't I was
00:58:01 I just couldn't bring myself to do it myself I'd rather just let these things wither away I'd rather
00:58:07 let people who I don't you know who I don't want to talk to anymore I'd rather just ignore them
00:58:12 until they go away and eventually D actually did piss off my brother Victor badly enough
00:58:21 that he excised him from the group he flew off the handle on D you know and uh and I just
00:58:29 like you know I let it happen and I rode the wave and I just never talked to him again like I didn't
00:58:33 even really make it clear that I also had a problem with him but the fact that I never tried to contact
00:58:39 him I think he you know got it and he kind the way the way it went down it was kind of like he
00:58:44 had done an infraction on our whole household you know he'd been kicked out of the house and uh
00:58:49 I haven't spoken to him since it's been like two and a half years maybe no about two years I guess
00:58:56 so you know that's the way I deal with problems ignore them until they go away until someone
00:59:03 deals with it until you know I can just burn the bridge break the ties or just they they stop
00:59:10 trying to contact me you know this is how I've avoided a lot of people online when there's a
00:59:15 lot of people who I you know was friends with for a little while then decided I wasn't really getting
00:59:19 out of anything out of the relationship or that it was just annoying or that I didn't want to
00:59:23 participate anymore so I just stopped talking to them stopped responding to their messages you know
00:59:27 they'd message me here and there I'd never respond you know I don't tell people hey I don't want to
00:59:33 be friends with you anymore I just let it let it go but there are some relationships I do want to
00:59:40 protect there are some people like everyone in the pcp who you know I want us to to continue to
00:59:47 work together to continue to be friends to continue to have things to do and so I think it's dangerous
00:59:53 when you know if some if I get mad at someone like that someone who I I actually care about
00:59:59 and I just hold on to that anger and don't say anything and let it fester and build because
01:00:04 what happens when you do that when you don't confront the issue is that it just builds on itself
01:00:10 because there's been no resolution so all I can do is think about that thing over and over again
01:00:15 and just keep thinking like you know and then if something like that happens again that it just
01:00:20 builds on to the pile and I haven't let the person know that it bothers me you know I haven't told
01:00:26 them hey you have to stop doing this or else you know eventually you know I'm gonna it's gonna
01:00:33 feel like the cons of knowing you outweigh the pros and I have to let people know that and I hope
01:00:39 I can do that you know and I know it's like it's kind of a selfish way of thinking in the first
01:00:46 place even that like I'm the gatekeeper to our friendship but I do feel like you know this is a
01:00:53 horrible thing to say but I feel like I treat relationships in the same way that I treat
01:00:59 watching anime that every episode that we go through together I take stock of is this worth
01:01:08 continuing you know should I keep keep you know interacting with this show or should I drop it
01:01:16 and I feel the same way about people like you know if I feel like I'm net gaining from knowing you
01:01:23 from having your relationship with you then I'll keep it going and as soon as I start to feel like
01:01:29 you're a drain on me you're you know you're taking more energy than giving then I just drop it
01:01:38 and uh and I've dropped a lot of connections there's a lot of people there's a lot of
01:01:43 unresponded to mail in my inboxes on every social media site you know there's lots of people who I
01:01:50 just stopped talking to and then that last mail they sent trying to reconnect came and I just didn't
01:01:56 bother responding and uh you know I've probably lost a lot of connections I that I you know that
01:02:04 that are worthwhile that way but it's just I have such a hard time facing people facing the issues I
01:02:11 have you know and part of it is that I'm a harsh critic you know I am a harsh mean person who will
01:02:24 tell you exactly what I think is the problem in no uncertain terms you know if I have to
01:02:32 if it comes down to it and I'm going to tell you like what I think it's going to be brutal and harsh
01:02:38 and there's a lot of people I don't think can take that and I will say that one of the great
01:02:43 things about the pcp members in particular is that we can all take it you know we harshly
01:02:49 criticize each other all the time we criticize each other right on the show sometimes and there are
01:02:56 some criticisms that some of us can't take and we'll get mad about you know there are certain
01:03:01 things that I would avoid saying to certain members of the pcp but if it was something
01:03:08 that it came down to like this is a make or break for our friendship you need to know I have this
01:03:13 problem with you what allows me to be friends with those people is that they can hear that and
01:03:18 understand it you know and if they couldn't then that would be the end that's what I really value
01:03:25 out of people to give an example of a case where that you know it wasn't that way my ex-girlfriend
01:03:31 the whole time I was dating her like six months I had an endless litany of issues with her you
01:03:39 know there were so many things she did that made me mad that made me think I want this over but I
01:03:45 would never bring any of them up because I didn't think she could take it because her mindset would
01:03:50 not have been to hear those things and to say okay I'll try to you know to change or I'll try to
01:03:56 make this work instead what she would have said is well I guess I'm just a terrible person and
01:04:01 you know I guess you hate me and I guess we should break up and I didn't want to break up in spite
01:04:06 of all those issues you know but when we finally did break up then it was like well you know all
01:04:14 I had to think about was all the problems you know she she is another person who later tried to
01:04:20 contact me and I just ignored it I just didn't respond I didn't you know I just said well I've
01:04:27 already excised you from my life you are already gone to me you know so you know I really want to
01:04:40 cherish the connections I have with people who can take it who can you know hear that they've
01:04:48 done something that that makes me mad and then think you know to weigh the consequences to say
01:04:54 how much do I value my friendship with digi and if the answer is enough to change something to or
01:05:03 to rectify this problem then you know then to go through with it and I hope that I can change
01:05:11 for other people too you know again I'm I'm a very selfish person I do view these at a very one
01:05:19 sided lens it's like if you make me mad then it's then it's over if I make you mad then you know
01:05:27 I don't know how you'll take it I don't know if there's people who like I've never had the sense
01:05:33 that I've ever pissed anyone off enough that they stopped being my friend and that's what makes me
01:05:38 wonder if I'm just like a shit person you know for for thinking and acting this way because I
01:05:43 don't know anyone who's done this to me I've never had anyone just stop talking to me seemingly
01:05:50 out of frustration with me I've never had anyone at least not in my adult life maybe in high school
01:05:58 but even then I can't really remember you know I can't remember a time when someone was just like
01:06:04 ignoring me clearly out of the fact that they you know didn't want to talk to me anymore I don't
01:06:10 even know if people interpret me ignoring them that way I'm sure some have I'm sure to some people
01:06:15 it's been very clear you know um but you know I feel like I'm just an asshole and that I look at
01:06:26 people in a different and perhaps wrong way and I kind of resent myself for it
01:06:36 this whole fucking podcast has been very heavy for me it's I mean I don't feel like these things
01:06:48 would probably be as heavy to other people because a lot of this probably sounds like
01:06:54 either relatable or you know maybe maybe it doesn't sound like a big issue to someone else
01:07:02 because you're not experiencing these things they might just sound interesting you know it might
01:07:08 like I doubt anyone heard what I just said and thought wow you're a monster they probably thought
01:07:14 huh what a different way of looking at the world or actually that's exactly how I think
01:07:20 but for me it's like you know I'm literally describing to you things that I absolutely
01:07:26 hate about myself that's what this whole podcast has been you know trudging up the elements of me
01:07:33 that I most hate and explaining them I really hate that I have such a tendency to just abandon people
01:07:43 to leave people at the wayside to not talk about my problems to hole up in my you know in my room
01:07:50 in my space you know that's what I do when I'm when I when I don't want to face a problem I just
01:07:56 sit in my room you know I don't leave when I don't want to like go out into the world when I don't
01:08:02 want to speak to someone I just fucking I just become a hermit and that's what I always return to
01:08:09 I feel like I've been in this state for much of my life I feel like I've been retreating from society
01:08:13 for most of my life hiding you know hiding in this this safe cozy room surrounded by all this
01:08:21 cutesy imagery and cute anime girls trying to like pacify and distract me trying to give me
01:08:28 something to look at other than myself and the world outside and all the things that I fear
01:08:34 you know and this isn't even getting into my broad paranoias you know these are problems I have just
01:08:41 with with myself that are very specific but on a on a more broad scale I'm also extremely paranoid
01:08:48 about everything and I hate that about myself too but it's it's in so many different forms
01:08:53 like I have an utter paranoia that everyone in the world is constantly judging me or wants me dead
01:09:02 or that society is ultimately going to side against me at some point you know I have I guess
01:09:09 sort of a persecution complex like I spent I've spent a lot of time thinking about like
01:09:15 how I would explain myself uh in in like court or to a police officer for for any number of
01:09:22 reasons involving society changing like I always feel like you know one day I'm gonna be the the
01:09:30 main character in 1984 or something you know like the the the person who has broken society's
01:09:37 rules in such a way that I'm going to have to stand trial and that in spite of my perfect logic
01:09:43 and arguments the system will fail me you know I'm always afraid that that everyone's out to get me
01:09:52 that nothing's really on my side and you know I have I have a really hard time talking to people
01:10:00 about my problems talking to people about what's stressing me out you know at the very least
01:10:08 you know it's nice to have friends I can bitch to bitch and complain to and at least I have had
01:10:13 that I've pretty much always had you know someone around that I can just talk to in isolation
01:10:20 and complain about things you know I'm glad I've got friends living with me you know like Ben and
01:10:27 DeVue and my brother Victor who I can talk to and like share some of this stress and they can go
01:10:33 yeah I I get why that's a problem you know but at the same time living with other people you know
01:10:44 is exactly what causes these stresses and I'm there's there's parts of me that's constantly going like
01:10:53 should I just fucking run away and be by myself would I be happier by myself or by forging
01:10:59 new connections or by embracing the ones I have more you know we just did Radcon 2 and from the
01:11:09 outside Radcon 2 probably looks like a big party where we all just have fun and make stuff but
01:11:16 Radcon is incredibly stressful it is it it's just a powder keg of stress and fucking you know
01:11:26 intensity and everyone was feeling it I think I mean the amount of times that we were all just
01:11:32 standing around going oh god I want to die I wish I was dead you know I mean we joke about those
01:11:39 kind of things all the time whenever we're stressed out but like we always mean it you know when
01:11:46 someone is standing around saying I want to die even as a joke it means they're stressed out it means
01:11:53 that they do want to die on some level you know I don't think that phrase is ever completely a joke
01:11:59 I don't think anyone ever says the phrase I want to die and doesn't mean it on some level
01:12:05 and we were just standing around parroting it back and forth at each other for days
01:12:10 because what Radcon is is not just hanging out with your friends it's living with nine
01:12:19 extreme personalities who all have their own ways of living their own desires and are thrust into an
01:12:28 ultimately uncomfortable situation of living in a house with a bunch of other guys for fucking a
01:12:33 week you know sleeping in the open in on couches you know five people in one room and I don't even
01:12:42 have a lot of that problem I slept you know in my room by myself a lot of the time but I had to
01:12:47 organize all of it I have to drive everyone around you know figure out what everyone is eating what
01:12:53 everyone can afford you know everyone's got different levels of income different interests
01:12:57 different you know ways of life and we've got one car and and there are two cars me and Victor's
01:13:04 you know and different sleep schedules you know I want to be up all night Ben is always up all
01:13:12 night Nate wakes up early you know we're trying to we're just trying to force all these people who
01:13:18 live very different lives to live enough of the same life for a week to get a bunch of stuff done
01:13:25 and I've said this before that the best to me the best possible future for the pcp
01:13:32 is for us all to live in the same area not in the same house because living with other people
01:13:40 is kind of a nightmare you know every single every little difference between your lifestyles
01:13:48 is is monumental and sometimes it's not that big a deal you know um like me and Ben live on
01:13:56 opposite sides of the house and we rarely interact because Ben almost never wants to go out for any
01:14:02 reason he doesn't want to you know he stays in his room he doesn't want to do anything so that's fine
01:14:09 but like DeVu he needs food all the time DeVu eat like just goes through tons of fresh food so
01:14:16 you know I end up driving him around and we'll go to like the store or something
01:14:21 we'll drag Ben along sometimes and it's just like that little tiny incongruence in our lifestyles
01:14:27 that I only need to grocery shop every two weeks or so but he needs to every like five days to a
01:14:34 week is a problem you know because it means that either I have to get in my car when I don't want
01:14:41 to and drive from the grocery store or he has to go a few days without food you know waiting for me
01:14:47 to be willing to take him it's such a small thing but it causes stress for both of us you know
01:14:55 and I'm think you know DeVu tells me I need groceries and I'm thinking about that in the
01:14:58 back of my mind well I'm trying to get all this other stuff done and he's you know sitting around
01:15:02 hungry for a couple extra days living with other people is just a non-stop source of issues unless
01:15:09 you're trying to live together you know you're trying to do one thing like when you get married
01:15:14 and you have a family then it's like you are unified in your goals you are trying to mold your
01:15:20 lives around one another but I'm not trying to do that with the PCP I want to work with them I don't
01:15:25 want to live with them or like them you know and when you put us all in one place together like that
01:15:34 then it's not just us working together it's us living together and it is stressful you know it's
01:15:40 not like we got into a bunch of big fights I mean we did get into some pretty heated arguments
01:15:45 you know uh those of you who've listened to the apescape video will hear a part where like me
01:15:50 and DeVu get into an argument and I straight up leave the room because I was so heated you know
01:15:56 um sometimes stuff like that happens it's and it's kind of just a powder keg it's it's a bunch
01:16:03 of heated personalities you know and it was even more stressful because we had the only way to make
01:16:08 radcon happen was to base it around work you know and like I've talked a lot about how I love working
01:16:14 and I love working with these guys but man I would much rather I would much rather if we had just
01:16:19 spent a week hanging out you know if it was just a week of us hanging out not having cameras not
01:16:26 working on stuff that would have been great but we couldn't have afforded that we could not afford
01:16:32 you know four months after the previous radcon to have everyone pay for flights again to come down
01:16:37 here and do this thing for a week you know what made us able to do it was the Kickstarter and the
01:16:43 Kickstarter needed a product we can't just run a Kickstarter for us hanging out I don't think
01:16:48 I don't I don't think we'd that would work out maybe I should have tried
01:16:54 but it's such a shame you know it's a shame we didn't just hang out it's a shame we put ourselves
01:17:01 into an even more stressful situation where we had to get certain videos done on certain days
01:17:07 videos that involved watching stuff with each other you know we and so many people had so many
01:17:13 projects they wanted to get done and everyone wanted to be a part of everything so you've got
01:17:17 you know what should be like two person let's plays that are just fun and relaxing turn into
01:17:24 nine person chaotic nightmares where everyone's screaming over each other you know it's just
01:17:30 not a good way to live you should not live with with eight other extreme personalities
01:17:38 and and little resources you know with everyone living in the same space and and not having enough
01:17:44 cars to go around and it really made me like you know realize like yeah I the ideal way to live
01:17:52 would be all of us in the same area but I do not want to live with these guys I don't want us to
01:17:59 all share a roof I don't want and the problem is that that's the only reason that we're doing that
01:18:04 with me and Ben and DeVue is just simply that we can't afford it you know we can't afford we don't
01:18:09 have the money to all live in the same area if we did we'd just be doing that you know the only
01:18:15 reason we all live in this house is that we were able to split the rent extremely cheap
01:18:20 and um you know Ben would not be able to afford his own place definitely not DeVue could probably
01:18:27 not you know I don't pay him enough I don't make enough to pay him enough and really the only
01:18:32 reason I can't afford my own place is because I pay DeVue like I would have enough money to get my
01:18:38 own place but because I hire him because I want to have him employed by me you know I am putting
01:18:45 myself in his position where I have to split rent and have to live with him and Ben so you know
01:18:52 it's it's a very weird position to be in and I just want us to be as fast as possible I want
01:18:58 us to be in a situation where we can all have our own places and we can live near each other and just
01:19:04 you know work together and hang out because those are the things that that friends and business
01:19:10 partners should do you should work together and you should hang out those are fun things hanging
01:19:16 out is fun you know I had a lot more fun in the later half of Radcon when it was just Jesse here
01:19:23 because even though I love all those guys you know I would love to hang out with Hippo every other day
01:19:28 you know I he's so much fun to hang out with I love hanging out with Nate you know I love hanging
01:19:33 out with Munchie he was super fun I did I had never really had a chance to hang out with Munchie
01:19:37 until now and he was really you know he was great to have around but having him around along with
01:19:43 everyone else was hellish you know and I'd love it if we all just kind of lived in a space in a
01:19:50 in a in a play in one city you know and I could go hey let's go to lunch on Monday you know and
01:19:58 catch up and hang out and have a good time hey let's go play a video game we don't even have to
01:20:05 record it if we don't want to you know when we were uh when Jesse when Jesse was the only one
01:20:12 left we spent a lot of time playing video games me and him and Ben spent one whole night recording
01:20:16 let's plays it was really fun um and then we did a bunch with Victor we were playing through all the
01:20:22 tony hot games and Jesse was getting really stressed out about the fact that like you know
01:20:28 he's trying to beat these games but he keeps failing at certain challenges and just getting mad
01:20:35 and being like I just want to rush through this game because of the fact that we didn't have enough
01:20:38 to talk about to keep the podcast interesting you know because it's we were recording it so
01:20:43 there was this kind of need to be entertaining and Jesse feels that even more strongly than I do
01:20:48 like I was perfectly willing to just like kick back and relax and let it be like a goofy video
01:20:52 that wasn't really meant to be something all that serious but I've noticed watching Jesse that when
01:20:57 you turn a camera on him he transforms you know Jesse cannot stand not being an entertainer
01:21:04 when when there's when there's something recording at least that's how it seems to me
01:21:08 so you know I could see him getting stressed out and I was it's on some level I was like I just
01:21:13 want to watch you play tony hawk you know I don't care about the lens play I don't care about this
01:21:17 whole conceit that we have to be you know working on something I'm just enjoying sitting here
01:21:23 reading comics and watching Jesse play tony hawk and I'd love to be able to do that and for that
01:21:29 not to require a seven thousand dollar Kickstarter and living in the same house and you know if if
01:21:37 I'm hungry I better take Jesse because we're we're you know he's not going to be able to eat otherwise
01:21:43 but then he's you know like does he want to he has to eat it whenever I'm hungry you know because
01:21:48 he's kind of stuck with me you know that's I guess most people probably know about these things I mean
01:21:59 I had a lot of issues living with my family you know and living with Ben and DeVue has ultimately
01:22:07 been less stressful than living with my family was on some levels because while I didn't have to
01:22:12 worry about them too much you know my parents there was one of the biggest stresses in our lives
01:22:18 was that we all ate dinner together and I'm not even sure why we did it for so long I guess just
01:22:24 because shade was still growing up we all just felt like you know like it was something we had to
01:22:28 connect with as a family or something but just for the longest time and also because I was cheap
01:22:34 and Victor was poor so like the idea that we got a free meal every day was a was definitely a plus
01:22:40 but the most stressful thing in our family is that none of us have the same taste
01:22:44 uh you know my mom's a vegetarian my dad quit red meat at some point now he's a vegan they're
01:22:49 both vegan now now that they live together alone um you know and me Victor and shade all of different
01:22:54 tastes we're all picky and we would like just spend like almost an hour like every day trying to
01:23:02 figure out what to make for dinner like arguing about what to make or deciding and like none of
01:23:08 us could really cook well and everything we made turned out kind of mediocre and it was just like
01:23:12 and and we go to the grocery store and argue so much about like what we were gonna get and it was
01:23:16 just it was just this huge amount of stress that's only caused by the fact that we live together
01:23:22 and have decided to do this thing together and as soon as I started buying my own groceries that
01:23:26 all went away that whole thing went away that huge source of stress went away you know and like the
01:23:33 stresses I have now living with Ben DeVu Victor and shade are comparatively minor um but I still
01:23:40 can't help but think man if we each had our own place it would be such a weight off of our shoulders
01:23:44 you know like I feel like DeVu would really thrive on his own you know and he's like because he has
01:23:51 a huge problem with the cleanliness of the house me and Ben are fucking slobs you know we don't do
01:23:56 anything and I could tell it really bothers DeVu and he doesn't want to have to be the only person
01:24:01 cleaning because it sucks you know because he's the only person who cares so obviously we're not
01:24:05 gonna do it because we don't care but it sucks for him because why should he have to do it all
01:24:10 just because we're slobs you know so like you I would love for him to be able to have his own
01:24:17 place I think he'd be happier that way you know and I'd be happier we'd all be happier
01:24:23 and so we've all been talking about this whole idea of where are we all gonna move like where
01:24:27 are we gonna go are we still gonna have a place together are we all gonna move into separate
01:24:32 houses in some other town there's no reason to stay in Virginia Beach this place is kind of blows
01:24:37 and as we've been talking about it I've kind of come to the realization like I don't know how much
01:24:42 I care about whether we all you know live in the same place in the same house you know like
01:24:50 I would prefer we had our own places as soon as possible and I know not everybody can afford it
01:24:55 but at the same time the level of compromise that we have to go through to to be in the same place
01:25:00 like um you know the two main cities we've been looking at moving to are Austin and Portland
01:25:06 and I personally would love to go to Austin because that has a lot more to offer me personally
01:25:10 it's a much more music-centric city and I'm a big music guy it's got lots of events you know
01:25:16 and Portland is fun and cool and I mean it has those things it has music it has events but it's
01:25:20 just not quite the same level and Austin just seems more attractive to me overall but like
01:25:27 if we are sharing a place then it's kind of everyone's decision you know if we're all if
01:25:33 me and Ben and DeVue have to share a play a room or whatever uh or whoever else we bring you know
01:25:38 Ben would rather go to Portland and some of the other PCP guys would rather go to Portland and
01:25:42 I'm sitting here thinking like am I going to keep compromising in order to have us all you
01:25:49 know live together or should I just go fucking live in Austin by myself you know I could do that
01:25:55 if I wanted to and I don't know I don't know the answer yet but I know that there is one clear
01:26:01 solution that will make all of these problems go away and that's making a lot more money if we all
01:26:08 made a lot more money none of this would be an issue you know if each of us could afford our own
01:26:13 place in the same city done there's no problem there's no issue you know if I could afford to both
01:26:23 live by myself and pay DeVue enough that he could live by himself no issue so that's
01:26:31 that's the that's where I'm going after this you know this whole podcast has been mired and
01:26:36 what are my current issues and the solution to a lot of my problems to the problem of stagnation
01:26:44 to the problem of complacency that I talked about earlier to the problem of not wanting to
01:26:49 live with other people but you know still wanting to maintain relationships with those people you
01:26:53 know with the least strain possible the problems all the problems I've talked about if I just make
01:27:00 a lot more money those problems go away whoever said money can't buy happiness is a fucking idiot
01:27:10 peace out
01:27:30 you
01:28:30 You
