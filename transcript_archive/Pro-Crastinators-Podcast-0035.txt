00:00:00 Jump down, jump down, and then say some fucking gay shit.
00:00:05 I'm gay!
00:00:11 Hello everyone and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast!
00:00:19 That's right everyone, you should be excited because this is a very special week, but first let's introduce everybody who's here today.
00:00:25 It's me, of course, the best guy ever, King of the Castle, Lord of the Manor. We also have Ben.
00:00:31 It's me, Ben Saint, of Patreon!
00:00:37 Wow, wow, what a meme.
00:00:39 Digibro!
00:00:42 Hey, what's up, buddy?
00:00:43 We've got Hippocrit.
00:00:46 I wasn't prepared for saying anything.
00:00:49 And we've got Jess Endlet G, also called Larry the Comic.
00:00:56 And finally, Tom Oliver, the best one of the three.
00:01:04 That's right, okay, so today is a very exciting day because what we're doing today is we're touching each other's dicks.
00:01:11 We're putting them in our mouths. We're making a
00:01:13 spherical circle and we're just going all kinds of crazy because this is the great circle, Jerk!
00:01:18 Yeah!
00:01:21 You see, you see viewers, as it happens, we're all the best and today we're gonna tell each other that over and over again.
00:01:30 It's come to my attention that there has been far, far too little shilling of ourselves on this channel.
00:01:36 It's become a big problem. The people need it, the people crave it, and so this is our response.
00:01:41 I wouldn't say shilling. I would describe it as fluffing.
00:01:44 Well, you can shill yourself.
00:01:46 I mean, you know, it's, you know, pick your turn, it's all good.
00:01:48 Let me fluff my ball here.
00:01:50 I would describe it as campaigning.
00:01:54 Yeah, everyone's all about campaigning nowadays.
00:01:56 All the campaign trail.
00:01:58 Suddenly, all of us, like, just spontaneously grew ties out of our shirts.
00:02:03 Yeah!
00:02:07 And I don't know if this is relevant at all,
00:02:08 but it does so happen that we are recording this on Guy Fawkes Day, the man who tried to blow up Parliament and upset that
00:02:15 establishment, and that's why you need to vote for Bernie Sanders.
00:02:18 Write him in on the fucking ballot.
00:02:20 I'm for that. I'm for writing in Bernie Sanders.
00:02:22 And, you know, yeah, write in whoever.
00:02:24 Write in, write in this guy.
00:02:25 Write in, and let G, write in me, write in anybody.
00:02:29 Okay, so let's, let's, what are we gonna do here?
00:02:31 We're gonna pick somebody and then talk about how they're the best.
00:02:33 Is that what we want to do?
00:02:34 The concept here is each of us is gonna take our hand and we're gonna just, you know, 45 degrees to the right.
00:02:41 Grab the next guy's dick.
00:02:43 Jack, jack at it, jack at it, jack at it, jack.
00:02:46 Okay, so why don't we start?
00:02:47 I mean, I'm looking in, in the chat.
00:02:49 We got Ben is the first.
00:02:51 So let's just all start with Jack.
00:02:52 No, no, no, not me.
00:02:53 Jack and a dick.
00:02:54 Oh, I'm sorry, Ben. You're the top of the bill here.
00:02:56 Jack and a dick.
00:03:00 Um, here's, for friends, is what I like about Ben's work.
00:03:04 No!
00:03:06 It's, it's something Ben first.
00:03:08 I can't take what's helpful.
00:03:09 Let's do Nate so he can shut up and he'll have to listen to us talk about him.
00:03:11 Uh, okay, I guess.
00:03:13 If you want.
00:03:15 Uh, who wants to talk about how cool Nate is?
00:03:18 Oh god, this is gay.
00:03:20 Right, that's the point.
00:03:22 It feels weird, right?
00:03:24 I didn't know it'd be gay.
00:03:28 I think without a doubt.
00:03:30 This is the most homoerotic one.
00:03:32 Yeah.
00:03:34 This is the part where everyone's realizing.
00:03:36 No one actually wants everyone to say where it's cool.
00:03:39 Okay, if you guys want to do me, I can take it.
00:03:41 I've steeled myself.
00:03:43 All right.
00:03:45 If we actually were at Radcon, if we were to do the gay thing, I think what would happen is we would get our dicks out.
00:03:53 Sex?
00:03:55 But we would be like, oh, I don't want to be the first guy to touch someone else's.
00:03:59 Well, yeah.
00:04:01 Even if you're not gay, that makes you the most gay of the group.
00:04:04 Standing in a circle without dicks out, looking at each other like, oh.
00:04:08 All right, all right.
00:04:10 I'm going to be the man to grab the dick first.
00:04:12 I volunteer as tribute.
00:04:14 Everyone, please praise me.
00:04:16 Just heap my well-deserved praise upon me.
00:04:20 Ben, I know you.
00:04:22 I've known you for the longest.
00:04:24 And I remember back when your art was not what it is now.
00:04:29 In fact, when we started TBAP some four years ago, perhaps now.
00:04:33 Three or four years.
00:04:35 I think it was four years ago.
00:04:37 I thought I think it was less than three.
00:04:39 Or maybe just about three years ago.
00:04:41 It was the end of 2013.
00:04:43 Right, okay.
00:04:45 So that's three years.
00:04:47 Three fucking years.
00:04:49 And your work was much less polished.
00:04:53 Comparing the stuff that you were producing then to what you're doing now with the Vapors and the Champion.
00:04:59 It is incredible to me that someone could advance that much in the span of time.
00:05:05 Yes.
00:05:07 And I've always liked how you are not like me where I need the security of making a plan.
00:05:13 I have my job because I don't trust myself to just go jump out and do something.
00:05:17 But you have never been like that.
00:05:19 You always just go jump headfirst into things.
00:05:22 And I've always admired that.
00:05:24 So there you go.
00:05:26 And you did it with your art.
00:05:28 And you know, TBAP was a similar sort of venture.
00:05:30 It was your suggestion, even though we both contributed mostly equally.
00:05:34 Yes.
00:05:36 I'm sure I'm glad.
00:05:38 Yes, wow.
00:05:40 That was very heartfelt, Nate.
00:05:42 And I appreciate that.
00:05:44 I don't know what to say.
00:05:46 I was really gay though.
00:05:48 Real gay though.
00:05:50 I'm just impressed with the way you can make like...
00:05:53 I'm just impressed with Magda.
00:05:55 I like her. She's great.
00:05:57 Magda's the best character design of all time.
00:05:59 Her hair is so awesome.
00:06:01 I love everything about it.
00:06:03 It's the coolest thing.
00:06:05 And she's got a very distinct silhouette.
00:06:07 I am jealous in terms of art skill.
00:06:09 Because I've always wanted to make like a comic.
00:06:11 Even a small one.
00:06:13 And then you just like, I'm going to make one and you did it.
00:06:17 And you made a website.
00:06:20 Over like six months I did it.
00:06:22 I mean, yes.
00:06:24 You had an idea and you just...
00:06:26 It was good.
00:06:28 It's got a good style.
00:06:30 Let's talk about the fact that Ben's area of expertise
00:06:34 is inherently more valid as art
00:06:36 than what most of us do,
00:06:38 which is YouTube and which is worthless
00:06:40 and should not exist.
00:06:42 I am the only real artist among us.
00:06:46 Yeah.
00:06:48 I lend us an air of much needed credibility.
00:06:52 You know, even aside from credibility,
00:06:54 it's good to just have diversity of any kind.
00:06:56 Aside from just a bunch of video guys
00:06:58 who just make videos,
00:07:00 it's good to have it.
00:07:02 Yeah, I like that because Ben's...
00:07:04 I mean, Ben is kind of a video guy.
00:07:06 And I like that some of us
00:07:08 can do more than one thing, you know?
00:07:10 Like, I basically don't do anything
00:07:12 other than videos and podcasts.
00:07:14 So it's cool that we have people around
00:07:16 who can simultaneously
00:07:18 can be in a video if need be
00:07:20 and can be good in a video if need be,
00:07:22 but also have like a whole different thing,
00:07:24 which Ben and Tom both...
00:07:26 You did just produce an album.
00:07:28 I don't want to get to the circle jerk of
00:07:30 Digit too hard right now, but I'm just...
00:07:32 We'll bring that up.
00:07:34 We'll touch on that.
00:07:36 I just several times stroke on it.
00:07:38 I respect the fact that Ben
00:07:40 is of a different breed
00:07:42 from most indie comic
00:07:44 people.
00:07:46 Because when you read
00:07:48 the Vapors, for example,
00:07:50 they're not falling in love
00:07:52 and nobody is a woman with a dick
00:07:54 and there's not any
00:07:56 trance, icky trance stuff
00:07:58 happening.
00:08:00 Yeah, thank God.
00:08:02 I'm confused. I'm confused what you're praising right now.
00:08:04 Well, I mean, compared to the landscape
00:08:06 of DeviantArt and Tumblr comics
00:08:08 that are bursting out of the internet at the scene...
00:08:10 You have the sort of like
00:08:12 Seinfeldian
00:08:14 aversion to anything trying too hard
00:08:16 to be deep.
00:08:18 So everything that you write comes off as
00:08:20 pretty sincere and real because it's not trying too hard.
00:08:22 Oh.
00:08:24 I feel that way too.
00:08:26 I feel like...
00:08:28 I hate to write a story
00:08:30 that's just easier, that's been written before.
00:08:32 Or that could be
00:08:34 described as conventional in any way.
00:08:36 I agree with Jesse in that I feel like
00:08:38 when I see most
00:08:40 art on the internet, I think
00:08:42 I immediately like
00:08:44 find a trend I'd compare it to.
00:08:46 Even great art. Like someone
00:08:48 like a GGDG
00:08:50 with cucumber quests. Like beautiful, beautiful art.
00:08:52 But when I see it, I think
00:08:54 this kind of reminds me of the New Wave Cartoon Network stuff
00:08:56 and what's going on on Tumblr a little bit, you know?
00:08:58 And I see all this art that's very
00:09:00 homestuck or very Tumblr, very this or that.
00:09:02 And I look at your stuff
00:09:04 and it's obvious that your manga inspired
00:09:06 but it doesn't look like manga
00:09:08 but it also doesn't look like
00:09:10 OEL, you know?
00:09:12 It's just its own thing.
00:09:14 It doesn't quite look like any other...
00:09:16 It doesn't make me think, well, this is
00:09:18 obviously where he comes from, you know?
00:09:20 Well, yeah. It could stand out
00:09:22 if it was on a shelf from other people
00:09:24 trying to do comics.
00:09:26 For sure.
00:09:28 Ben, I think there are two distinct things
00:09:30 about you that I really respect and appreciate.
00:09:32 The first is just like your raw ability
00:09:34 and like being able to draw the way
00:09:36 you draw the way I wish I could draw.
00:09:38 Like if I imagined in my mind
00:09:40 how my art style would naturally develop
00:09:42 over the course of five years, it would end up
00:09:44 something like yours.
00:09:46 Just like, because I've always been
00:09:48 a really big fan of like
00:09:50 bold line art, like really distinct
00:09:52 character styles and like your art
00:09:54 especially with the champion really brings that
00:09:56 but you still have a lot of like sense of detail.
00:09:58 Like things are simplified
00:10:00 and streamlined and cartoonish but there's also just
00:10:02 enough detail there to give it like some dimension
00:10:04 to the grit that a lot of super simplified styles
00:10:06 don't have anymore.
00:10:08 And that's something I've always struggled to try
00:10:10 and do in my work that I've like streamlined stuff
00:10:12 but it's kind of gotten too streamlined
00:10:14 and I think it looks too basic.
00:10:16 But you definitely like ride that line really well.
00:10:18 And then the other thing that I really appreciate
00:10:20 about you is the fact that you like are able
00:10:22 to just like focus in on one thing
00:10:24 because like I wanted to do my comic
00:10:26 or I wanted to write my book and stuff
00:10:28 but I still want to do the YouTube
00:10:30 because I can't really let go of that
00:10:32 to the YouTube part. I want to do videos
00:10:34 and I want to do writing, I want to do blogging
00:10:36 and all these things but like you did T-Bap
00:10:38 they're like T-Bap's done, now I'm doing comics
00:10:40 and like just focusing on that one thing.
00:10:42 And I can't do that.
00:10:44 I am really good at focusing
00:10:46 but it's to my benefit and detriment
00:10:48 because I get obsessed
00:10:50 with one thing and I can't think about
00:10:52 anything else.
00:10:54 I've observed this cataclysmic
00:10:56 effect this could have in person.
00:10:58 I feel like the benefits would be
00:11:00 worth it especially for someone with my
00:11:02 mentality which can't do that at all.
00:11:04 It's always going to be a bit of the grass
00:11:06 is greener like if you're not like that
00:11:08 you'll see the benefits but yeah it's still
00:11:10 I mean there's certainly plenty of benefits
00:11:12 and I too would praise Ben for that
00:11:14 although I also have watched how
00:11:16 like none of the champion
00:11:18 was drawn in the last month
00:11:20 because of the Pokemon
00:11:22 I did get
00:11:24 obsessed with making the Nuzlocke vids
00:11:26 to the champion's detriment
00:11:28 I think the videos came out really good
00:11:30 but yeah.
00:11:32 There's a term for that kind of
00:11:34 hyper-focusing on one thing to the exclusion
00:11:36 of other things. Does it start with an A?
00:11:38 It may.
00:11:40 I'll leave it open to interpretation.
00:11:44 Another real cool thing in fact
00:11:46 just your very last... Artist.
00:11:48 Artist is the word.
00:11:50 Of course.
00:11:52 The last Nuzlocke
00:11:54 you did
00:11:56 that amazing
00:11:58 horrifically
00:12:00 tragic ending with the whole musical bit
00:12:02 that was great
00:12:04 and you know since you don't
00:12:06 do a lot of video editing on the whole
00:12:08 I very much am glad to see you
00:12:10 kind of adapt and do something like that
00:12:12 I mean nothing about it was hugely complex
00:12:14 but to take the extra effort
00:12:16 to put it in. I spent
00:12:18 a lot of time on that ending
00:12:20 because like I finished
00:12:22 that episode and I was like this is really
00:12:24 sad and I felt really sad
00:12:26 and I was like you know what
00:12:28 I should really edit this
00:12:30 I should really just go all out
00:12:32 and just push the sad angle of this scene
00:12:34 and just do everything I could
00:12:36 just do the flashbacks and the music
00:12:38 and cut out
00:12:40 the words I'm saying so that
00:12:42 I cut out a couple of like jokier lines
00:12:44 that sort of detracted from the pathos
00:12:46 of it.
00:12:48 Change the end card
00:12:50 just have it fade out on a whole different thing
00:12:52 and it was well done
00:12:54 yeah but I did
00:12:56 because I'm not really a video guy
00:12:58 it did take me an extraordinary amount of time
00:13:00 but I had a fucking vision
00:13:02 that I wanted to realize with that
00:13:04 ah well it was
00:13:06 yeah it knocked it out of the park
00:13:08 and if everything goes according to plan
00:13:10 the fucking finale will be
00:13:12 even more like that
00:13:14 I hope. Awesome.
00:13:16 I gotta say my time observing Ben
00:13:18 as an artist has been a constant
00:13:20 one upping of impressing me
00:13:22 more where like my first
00:13:24 exposure to Ben is
00:13:26 the first t-baps
00:13:28 which were not good it was
00:13:30 shut up you were great man get the fuck out of here
00:13:32 you don't know they had keg
00:13:34 and phantom that's the first couple of them
00:13:36 well they were sent to me because I was
00:13:38 the EQD poster guy
00:13:40 and I get sent this video that's like
00:13:42 you know these I
00:13:44 I didn't really take in the designs of the OCs
00:13:46 which are great but like the actual drawing
00:13:48 was not that amazing
00:13:50 it was a ritual we were performing
00:13:52 and the audio was really bad
00:13:54 but then suddenly I get sent this one
00:13:56 where all of a sudden the designs are great
00:13:58 and I assumed that you guys like
00:14:00 you know paid some artists
00:14:02 to like revamp your OCs or something
00:14:04 when I first saw it like oh wow
00:14:06 now suddenly the art is good and the audio is decent
00:14:08 and then alright I'll definitely post this on EQD
00:14:10 and then all of a sudden each episode
00:14:12 there's all these new
00:14:14 artistic styles coming in
00:14:16 there's all these different ideas
00:14:18 there's this one where phantom horn is like in live action
00:14:20 and he's spilling ink all over the page
00:14:22 trying to draw stuff
00:14:24 that was fucking genius
00:14:26 that was the moment when I was like
00:14:28 whoa these guys are fucking great
00:14:30 and then phantom reviews
00:14:32 and keg reviews these huge art
00:14:34 like animatic projects
00:14:36 spent like six months
00:14:38 drawing fucking phantom reviews
00:14:40 spent me so much
00:14:42 I could do it so much faster now
00:14:44 that's the only thing I can say
00:14:46 and then when I met you guys
00:14:48 and you were like talking about your OCs
00:14:50 and all the shit you'd made up and I was just like
00:14:52 this wellspring of creativity
00:14:54 being wasted on ponies
00:14:56 and then finally
00:14:58 we made the, we had the
00:15:00 collection of the greatest pony OCs
00:15:02 every single one of our OCs was the
00:15:04 greatest pony OCs ever made
00:15:06 that is no hyperbola right there
00:15:08 sticky situation needs his own comics
00:15:10 there was sticky situation
00:15:12 there was ultimate pumpkin
00:15:14 there was a horsefister
00:15:16 horsefister oh there was a silver lining
00:15:18 silver lining a good one
00:15:20 he was awesome are we forgetting any
00:15:22 I think we might be forgetting some
00:15:24 but eventually that great talent
00:15:26 stopped being wasted on ponies
00:15:28 and then for like months
00:15:30 Ben's like I'm working on this comic
00:15:32 and now I remember when I like
00:15:34 when we did the comic trades
00:15:36 at a brony con and I know Ben remembers
00:15:38 me saying this but I was just so impressed
00:15:40 with how dynamic Ben could make
00:15:42 the poses of the ponies like so
00:15:44 fast because the comics jam is you have
00:15:46 five minutes to draw
00:15:48 one panel of a comic and then we all trade
00:15:50 you know and everyone else would just try
00:15:52 to draw like an okay
00:15:54 picture it would be like
00:15:56 I'll try to draw the
00:15:58 face and make it look okay you know
00:16:00 I'm talking about other like people who consider
00:16:02 themselves artists other deviant art artists
00:16:04 and stuff you know people were friends with
00:16:06 they're drawing like a
00:16:08 a decent looking
00:16:10 photo of a pony
00:16:12 Ben would draw these super dynamic
00:16:14 poses of like a character
00:16:16 doing something you know like
00:16:18 doing some really interesting
00:16:20 thing that totally brings it to life and I
00:16:22 would split I would split it into
00:16:24 I would split my panel into multiple panels
00:16:26 and draw like scenes
00:16:28 playing out
00:16:30 and like just I remember that
00:16:32 you know over time
00:16:34 I mean I eventually saw the Vapors
00:16:36 this is fucking great you know I love the characters
00:16:38 I love the art style and everything
00:16:40 and then
00:16:42 everything you've done since then has impressed me more
00:16:44 like I liked Brunswick
00:16:46 even more than chapter one of the Vapors
00:16:48 you know I like
00:16:50 champions art is even more impressed the character designs
00:16:52 are fucking just gorgeous
00:16:54 in champion those are my favorites incidentally
00:16:56 is both the girls from champion
00:16:58 yeah
00:17:00 Agatha is the cutest Agatha is
00:17:02 number one waifu from the Beniverse
00:17:04 and then I was shocked all over again
00:17:06 when inktober started
00:17:08 because you started doing these like really sketchy
00:17:10 ink drawings
00:17:12 with like different colored pens
00:17:14 in totally different styles
00:17:16 because I only know you for like the minimal look
00:17:18 and then suddenly you're drawing these like really
00:17:20 detailed robots and like
00:17:22 these muscle men and shit
00:17:24 and fucking and I was like where did this come
00:17:26 from because this is almost
00:17:28 even cooler like even cooler
00:17:30 than what I know you for like I like the
00:17:32 minimal Scott Pilgrimmy stuff but the
00:17:34 the hyper detail stuff I was like man
00:17:36 I want to see Ben draw a fucking post apocalypse
00:17:38 war story now with mechs and
00:17:40 shit um you know totally
00:17:42 Erygia anyone who doesn't know
00:17:44 what I'm talking about go to Ben's twitter look at his inktober drawings
00:17:46 all of those were like
00:17:48 like literally concept completion
00:17:50 in like 30 minutes like even the big robot
00:17:52 like that's a completely chilling what's Ben's
00:17:54 twitter handle it's at Ben something
00:17:56 it's also ugly it's all so ugly
00:17:58 with two L's on the all
00:18:00 but like that robot is
00:18:02 a completely original robot design
00:18:04 it's not based on anything Ben just
00:18:06 came up with a robot and drew it and it
00:18:08 looks like what would be
00:18:10 in you know like an 80s
00:18:12 cyberpunk manga or something
00:18:14 but it's it's not actually
00:18:16 it's not someone else's design
00:18:18 here's a here's a flattering comparison
00:18:20 since we're talking about robots do you know that Aichi
00:18:22 Ryota has said that if he finished
00:18:24 one piece one day he'd like his next series to be
00:18:26 a mecha series or some sort of robot
00:18:28 that would be crazy I mean this is
00:18:30 it was probably like 10 years ago at this point
00:18:32 but he did say it and to
00:18:34 to cap off my praising
00:18:36 Ben's artwork you know
00:18:38 just like two nights ago me
00:18:40 and Ben and DeVue did like a little
00:18:42 drawings jam where we just like for
00:18:44 10 minutes I gave us a topic and we'd
00:18:46 all draw a picture and like I would
00:18:48 spend like 10 minutes just
00:18:50 trying to make a comprehensible
00:18:52 face like just that I want
00:18:54 you to understand that this is a human
00:18:56 is all I was worried about and
00:18:58 you know DeVue was drawing these like weird
00:19:00 esoteric things and then Ben
00:19:02 would show us like a page with like four
00:19:04 different illustrations on it you know all
00:19:06 these different characters doing all this different stuff
00:19:08 that's also on his twitter did you I
00:19:10 I want to mention that I've never
00:19:12 been I've never been sadder
00:19:14 that you're not a better artist because the
00:19:16 picture the vapors fan art you tried to
00:19:18 draw was like yeah the bet it was
00:19:20 beautiful I loved it so much but then
00:19:22 you looking at it it's like I couldn't
00:19:24 even tell what it was
00:19:26 no yeah it was it was great
00:19:28 concept no execution at all
00:19:30 it was amazing though it was Vincent lying
00:19:32 in bed vaping and he was vaping up a cloud
00:19:34 that was taking the form of like a
00:19:36 beautiful girl yeah yeah he was like
00:19:38 vaping he was he was like vaping
00:19:40 his ideal girl yeah
00:19:42 it was supposed to be a qt 3.14
00:19:44 as it says in the clouds
00:19:46 I might totally say I like that so much
00:19:48 I might go and make it myself because it's
00:19:50 really I hope so you can actually
00:19:52 why was God awful
00:19:54 like the image you have in your mind is
00:19:56 so much better than what you would look
00:19:58 at if I showed it to you
00:20:00 especially because I drew Vincent like
00:20:02 totally wrong um
00:20:04 but yeah and other than that I'll also praise
00:20:06 the fact that Ben Cannon will eat
00:20:08 anything
00:20:10 Ben has this might not be
00:20:12 considered a lot of people might think
00:20:14 you know they might think Ben
00:20:16 he doesn't shower very often
00:20:18 so bad
00:20:20 because I never leave the house okay
00:20:22 has no scruples about anything
00:20:24 some people might see that as a bad thing
00:20:26 but personally I really
00:20:28 I legitimately admire the fact
00:20:30 that Ben will eat
00:20:32 absolutely anything
00:20:34 I don't like it because it's there
00:20:36 I just want to put on the record
00:20:38 we've been saying this shit to Ben for years
00:20:40 and he never believed us we've got outside
00:20:42 proof now we've got testimony
00:20:44 it's not just us
00:20:46 I know
00:20:48 I have terrible hygiene it's because I never leave
00:20:50 my room that's the reason
00:20:52 by the way Ben
00:20:54 speaking of your art
00:20:56 here's a little inside scoop folks
00:20:58 for people who like the vapors
00:21:00 I remember when you were finishing it
00:21:02 you would finish basically the whole thing
00:21:04 if I recall correctly the very last thing
00:21:06 you were working on was just one panel
00:21:08 in the middle that was like a shot
00:21:10 of the apartment building after Vincent
00:21:12 I think came back home
00:21:14 with a shot of the building from outside
00:21:16 of the dorm room yeah
00:21:18 that is by far
00:21:20 well it's the most
00:21:22 attractive looking picture
00:21:24 frankly
00:21:26 it's kind of my favorite thing you've ever drawn
00:21:28 just that picture of the building
00:21:30 just that picture of that building
00:21:32 like the way the clouds
00:21:34 the spooky way the clouds are coming out of some windows
00:21:36 and the lights
00:21:38 I do really like that
00:21:40 it was a great picture
00:21:42 it's a bit like my banner on Topastic
00:21:44 or something because I really liked it
00:21:46 appropriate
00:21:48 Ben put your dick away
00:21:50 who are we sucking next
00:21:52 Patreon.com
00:21:54 there's never been a better time
00:21:56 there's never been a better time
00:21:58 I'm just imagining
00:22:00 Ben
00:22:02 literally holding his dick
00:22:04 about to put it away and then he goes wait
00:22:06 and then he shakes it and says like
00:22:08 Patreon.com
00:22:10 gross
00:22:12 alright well next on the list here
00:22:14 thank you everyone for all those kind words
00:22:16 and even for the less kind ones
00:22:18 our next I guess is Digi
00:22:20 since he's number two on our list here
00:22:22 just skip me
00:22:24 why do you get to fucking
00:22:26 opted to skip
00:22:28 Digi
00:22:30 I'm very impressed all the time
00:22:32 that what you do
00:22:34 with your life is exactly and only
00:22:36 what you want to do and no more and no less
00:22:38 and you are
00:22:40 you have
00:22:42 I don't know you've just got like a drive
00:22:44 you've got a drive to exhaustively
00:22:46 catalog your thoughts on this one
00:22:48 thing and you've
00:22:50 formed your whole life around
00:22:52 doing that
00:22:54 and it's pretty amazing actually
00:22:56 thank you
00:22:58 I'm very jealous of the fact that
00:23:00 you have been writing
00:23:02 for so long that you're so good at it
00:23:04 that you can do all the stuff
00:23:06 you do really quick
00:23:08 just crank it out
00:23:10 such a good talent to have
00:23:12 or skill to have
00:23:14 to be able to do what you do for a living
00:23:16 I was at that speed
00:23:18 I was trying to write a script for my Lisa
00:23:20 thing and I was like this is not coming
00:23:22 out good and I thought you know if
00:23:24 Digi could bang out like ten pages on this
00:23:26 like if he were the one who loved Lisa
00:23:28 and wanted to make a video on it the video would be done
00:23:30 in a day honestly at this point
00:23:32 I wouldn't even have to script it
00:23:34 exactly
00:23:36 this is the problem with praising me
00:23:38 is that I'm just going to double down on all of it
00:23:40 I'm sure you will
00:23:42 let's not beat around the bush here
00:23:44 because Digi is obviously leading the charge
00:23:46 for all of us
00:23:48 into being successful at all of this kind of
00:23:50 shit
00:23:52 which one of you is sucking off a vacuum cleaner
00:23:54 stop it
00:23:56 I'm vaping hard
00:23:58 dude you're vaping I'm vaping dude
00:24:00 guys
00:24:02 good work Kieran that cancer
00:24:04 we're the vapors
00:24:06 thank you
00:24:08 Digi
00:24:10 the professionalism that you bring
00:24:12 to doing all this shit
00:24:14 is
00:24:16 it'd be an understatement to think that I use it
00:24:18 as
00:24:20 the path that I am hoping to follow
00:24:22 it's pretty much
00:24:24 try to copy what you're doing
00:24:26 and frankly there's no higher praise
00:24:28 that I can give than I am willing to follow
00:24:30 all the same path as what you're doing
00:24:32 and it's not like we make the exact same content
00:24:34 or anything but
00:24:36 you always talk about how
00:24:38 you're trying to blend your boogie and your pop
00:24:40 your wish
00:24:42 to make your content that you like
00:24:44 but then possibly even equally important
00:24:46 is to make it digestible to people
00:24:48 make it popular and get it out there
00:24:50 so people can appreciate it
00:24:52 that is a very valuable lesson
00:24:54 that someone like me
00:24:56 I think would really resist
00:24:58 because I'm kind of a foolish
00:25:00 naive idealist about these things
00:25:02 that I'm trying to shake off
00:25:04 but seeing that you've just done it and it's worked out
00:25:06 so great, relatively speaking
00:25:08 I think it's been
00:25:10 extremely helpful to me
00:25:12 and I'm just, I'm really glad to know you
00:25:14 and to
00:25:16 sort of be able to be involved in this kind of stuff
00:25:18 super gay
00:25:20 full gay on this
00:25:22 I don't know, I'm being honest
00:25:24 you're not holding anything back
00:25:26 somebody has to
00:25:28 get the gay going
00:25:30 yeah, somebody has to get the gays out
00:25:32 what have I been reduced to that I'm leading the gay charge
00:25:34 oh god
00:25:36 I apologize
00:25:38 I respect that Digi does not
00:25:40 let himself get bogged down in perfectionism
00:25:42 at all
00:25:44 like for example
00:25:46 yeah, his stuff totally sucks and it's great
00:25:48 he's basically garbage
00:25:50 like when I was over there
00:25:52 and we were putting the finishing touches
00:25:54 on the bedroom bedrock album
00:25:56 and I gave him the verses that I had recorded
00:25:58 before I came over
00:26:00 I was listening to Get Action, I was listening to my verse
00:26:02 and I was like, I feel like I could do this part
00:26:04 a little bit better here
00:26:06 but Digi's like, what I just posted it and I'm like, okay
00:26:10 I remember that
00:26:12 if it had been up to me, I would have just recorded
00:26:14 my verse a thousand million times
00:26:16 and the album would have never ever come out
00:26:18 well it's funny, Jesse
00:26:20 because you're the one who's always saying
00:26:22 if you really love someone
00:26:24 you'd love them warts and all
00:26:26 like you'd love all the imperfections
00:26:28 about it
00:26:30 but I hate myself
00:26:32 so I must have no warts
00:26:34 I release stuff that's like
00:26:36 I release stuff that I have big
00:26:38 problems with but then over time
00:26:40 I gradually just kind of take that as
00:26:42 like, oh well that's just part of it
00:26:44 it's just a flawed thing
00:26:46 and that's just
00:26:48 a part of the product
00:26:50 an excuse to not have to keep working on it
00:26:52 mostly but
00:26:54 it's kind of an art form in itself
00:26:56 to recognize that your standards
00:26:58 that you're bringing as the creator of the artwork
00:27:00 whatever it may be are not what people
00:27:02 are going to be viewing it as
00:27:04 and I think guys like me and Jesse
00:27:06 I would say it's a huge weakness
00:27:08 I definitely have a problem with that
00:27:10 Nate, you introduced me
00:27:12 to a quote
00:27:14 it was like, in this moment
00:27:16 I'm euphoric
00:27:18 no no, it wasn't that one
00:27:20 it was
00:27:22 art is never finished only abandoned
00:27:24 I don't know who said that
00:27:26 but you told me one time and I was like
00:27:28 wow that's so true and you know it's
00:27:30 part of art, part of being an artist
00:27:32 is learning the ideal moment to abandon it
00:27:34 when continuing to work
00:27:36 is going to no longer yield
00:27:38 worthwhile results
00:27:40 that is a very difficult balance
00:27:42 to find
00:27:44 I'm still working on it
00:27:46 that's one of the advantages that Digi has
00:27:48 it was given to him
00:27:50 it's just that he's produced more stuff
00:27:52 than any of us and as a result
00:27:54 he's gotten just more experience
00:27:56 at what is appropriate, when to stop
00:27:58 when to keep going and I think it's served him
00:28:00 quite well
00:28:02 there's another thing
00:28:04 I want to talk about
00:28:06 that you're not embarrassed at all
00:28:08 to wear your influences on your sleeve
00:28:10 and just copy things that you think would be cool
00:28:12 because I've always had a problem
00:28:14 with like
00:28:16 every time Jesse does something interesting
00:28:18 Digi says oh I want to do that and then you do it
00:28:20 and it's like
00:28:22 if I were to
00:28:24 feel like I wanted
00:28:26 to copy somebody
00:28:28 I would feel apprehensive
00:28:30 I would feel like it's wrong
00:28:32 or cheap
00:28:34 in some way but
00:28:36 I never feel like there's anything to be ashamed of
00:28:38 when you do it
00:28:40 recently you did
00:28:42 the podcast
00:28:44 by yourself where you talked about the thumbnails
00:28:46 and I'm like
00:28:48 I kind of agree but I don't want to copy him
00:28:50 I got over that
00:28:52 and I just changed them all and it is better
00:28:54 that video created a storm
00:28:56 where like everyone's out there changing their fucking thumbnails
00:28:58 yeah
00:29:00 this isn't about Digi exactly
00:29:02 but I remember in one of
00:29:04 in one of Mumki's nuzzlocks
00:29:06 he says like hey guys if you like my videos
00:29:08 and you want to do nuzzlocks like this
00:29:10 don't feel like
00:29:12 go ahead and copy me
00:29:14 because I've copied this from everyone else
00:29:16 so it's like
00:29:18 just do it
00:29:20 Mumki is even more than me
00:29:22 very willing to wear influences on his sleeve
00:29:24 and Jesse as well
00:29:26 Jesse I mean directly
00:29:28 quotes wrestlers constantly and stuff
00:29:30 and the way I see it
00:29:32 and the reason I do it that way is that
00:29:34 for one thing I don't think there's such thing as original ideas
00:29:36 like you are the product
00:29:38 of
00:29:40 what you've experienced before
00:29:42 no one learns how to write
00:29:44 who's never read a book before
00:29:46 the fact that you even have the idea
00:29:48 of a book is because you've read a book
00:29:50 and
00:29:52 your ability to write is going to be the summation
00:29:54 of all those other people's books
00:29:56 combined with yourself
00:29:58 and then also whatever you take from someone else
00:30:00 you're going to inherently make it different
00:30:02 by not being them
00:30:04 even if I just outright steal a Jesse line
00:30:06 and deliver it the way he can
00:30:08 so it's going to be different
00:30:10 it's going to have a different meaning when it comes out of my mouth
00:30:12 so that's sort of my philosophy about that
00:30:14 you know going off of Gibbs Point
00:30:16 a little bit ago
00:30:18 where he said it's made him more open and stuff
00:30:20 about influences
00:30:22 and that led into what you're talking about now
00:30:24 it's funny to me to think back
00:30:26 because you know how keg standard
00:30:28 one of the things about the character
00:30:30 was that he
00:30:32 loved anime but was embarrassed about it
00:30:34 it was like ashamed of that
00:30:36 for anyone who isn't aware that's
00:30:38 our old pony OC
00:30:40 right, right
00:30:42 that was very much a real thing for me
00:30:44 when I was in high school I wore a lot of anime shirts
00:30:46 and I just didn't care
00:30:48 because I was a silly little boy
00:30:50 but in college I sort of developed
00:30:52 thanks to the friends I hung out with a little bit
00:30:54 who didn't appreciate the stuff that I did
00:30:56 I definitely kind of repressed that stuff a little bit
00:30:58 you were rubbing them talking about it
00:31:00 that's right
00:31:02 wow that didn't admit to like an anime
00:31:04 well I think it was
00:31:06 I think it's a bad thing
00:31:08 to not be honest about the things that you like
00:31:10 and I've just noticed over the last couple of years
00:31:12 since meeting guys like you Digi
00:31:14 and Jesse too
00:31:16 and just kind of getting immersed in this stuff
00:31:18 that side of me is like the best guy ever
00:31:20 Persona who just like has all these wifey's
00:31:22 around him like I feel like that's
00:31:24 more true to the guy that I've always wanted to be
00:31:26 and I think it's through the influence of guys like you
00:31:28 that I kind of was able to
00:31:30 you know realize that about myself
00:31:32 let me say I may have said this to you
00:31:34 before Digi but
00:31:36 back in the day when I discovered you
00:31:38 when it was pony time you know
00:31:40 which it always is
00:31:42 not that that ever stopped
00:31:44 it's pony time
00:31:46 you know what they say even a broken clock
00:31:48 is pony time twice a day
00:31:52 so I remember like I watched a couple of your videos
00:31:54 and I was like this guy and I remember that
00:31:56 my impression was like this guy is wicked
00:31:58 uncool and he's wicked lame
00:32:00 but he's so like
00:32:02 he's so enthusiastic
00:32:04 about the things
00:32:06 that aren't cool about him
00:32:08 that it kind of circles around to being cool again
00:32:10 that's kind of exactly how Jesse
00:32:12 said he got into me
00:32:14 that it was obvious that you were
00:32:16 doing this lame stuff
00:32:18 you were doing this lame stuff but delivering
00:32:20 with so much confidence that it didn't feel that lame
00:32:22 yeah the confidence
00:32:24 is great
00:32:26 the fact that you're just
00:32:28 you never second guess yourself
00:32:30 or at least never in a video
00:32:32 you would never say
00:32:34 well maybe or maybe not
00:32:36 unless I legitimately am not sure
00:32:38 if the information I'm saying is true
00:32:40 if it's like an opinion thing
00:32:42 you've made your decision and then you say it
00:32:44 and it's like that's me
00:32:46 until you change your mind
00:32:48 the thing about there being no
00:32:50 guilty pleasures
00:32:52 I've taken into myself
00:32:54 and I've made it part of my life philosophy as well
00:32:56 it's an excellent point I think
00:32:58 um
00:33:00 well thanks for all the
00:33:02 and that's why on every digi video
00:33:04 go smash that motherfucking like button
00:33:06 thanks
00:33:08 thanks for all the gay praise everybody
00:33:10 but I want to say for our audience
00:33:12 because I was kind of
00:33:14 was going to have you all skip me
00:33:16 because I feel like the point of this is to
00:33:18 to pump people up who aren't as watched
00:33:20 and obviously everybody
00:33:22 but uh like what I want to say
00:33:24 about this is that every single one of the things
00:33:26 you guys have praised me for
00:33:28 is something that was
00:33:30 something I had to learn
00:33:32 and was all something that I you know
00:33:34 have taken on over the years
00:33:36 you know I started writing
00:33:38 my anime blog in 2007
00:33:40 and none of the praise you guys are
00:33:42 lavishing on me would have been true
00:33:44 back then except for the fact that I write
00:33:46 fast and that was always true
00:33:48 and I was a lot less consistent
00:33:50 but I did write fast
00:33:52 and try to get ideas out there as fast as possible
00:33:54 and I think that
00:33:56 that had a huge
00:33:58 did a lot to make all the rest of it follow
00:34:00 and um I've quoted this before
00:34:02 from shirobako there's this part
00:34:04 where this old guy says like you know
00:34:06 you have to get fast when you're young
00:34:08 because as you get older you lose endurance
00:34:10 but you you will keep gaining
00:34:12 skill you just won't have the endurance
00:34:14 to just do a whole lot of things really
00:34:16 fast and I really think that because
00:34:18 I was just young and so full of energy
00:34:20 I just made so much bullshit
00:34:22 just an endless sea of
00:34:24 bullshit and if you go read my blog
00:34:26 it's all there it's all shit
00:34:28 go read anything I wrote before 2011
00:34:30 you'll be like holy fuck
00:34:32 I can't believe that I listen to this guy
00:34:34 ever you know but
00:34:36 uh but that's what it took
00:34:38 you know it took just getting out all
00:34:40 that stuff and I I'm
00:34:42 glad that everyone because
00:34:44 I have all that experience and I'm so good at analyzing it
00:34:46 and explaining it that I can tell
00:34:48 that to other people and they can skip a lot
00:34:50 of the steps that I had to go through you know
00:34:52 like that speed is
00:34:54 kind of like the core strength there's the seed
00:34:56 that allowed you know it's other shit to
00:34:58 come for seed
00:35:00 which we'll be
00:35:02 coming out of your dick once we can finish
00:35:04 up this inter concession yeah I've blown my load
00:35:06 I'm putting it back so who's
00:35:08 so who's next who's next on the
00:35:10 hypocrite hypocrite is next on the list
00:35:12 oh oh what what
00:35:14 can one say about a man who
00:35:16 was both hippo and
00:35:18 gibbon and gibbon monkey
00:35:20 and crit uh we all kind
00:35:22 of just fell in love with you gib
00:35:24 back in the pony days
00:35:26 when you were on give and take making your
00:35:28 shit there and you were
00:35:30 there was something you know actually what was great
00:35:32 about uh the way me and Ben first
00:35:34 noticed you was that you
00:35:36 made these big old fucking
00:35:38 um compilations of like what other
00:35:40 guys were doing like there was all the people
00:35:42 doing just reacting to the current
00:35:44 pony episode but you went
00:35:46 way further than other people and did this
00:35:48 whole big animated thing of like
00:35:50 all the analysis dudes and me and
00:35:52 Ben lost our fucking mind this was the
00:35:54 first time we thought anyone gave a shit about us
00:35:56 when among the other people you animated the two of
00:35:58 us just made these little dolls of us
00:36:00 put us in there we were losing
00:36:02 our shit we were over the fucking
00:36:04 moon we were somebody cared about us it was
00:36:06 the best the the thing about
00:36:08 um hippo
00:36:10 the thing or well since we're talking about back in the day
00:36:12 yeah the thing about your your
00:36:14 pony videos is just you just you just
00:36:16 went way further than anyone else and you actually
00:36:18 had jokes and you actually did
00:36:20 like made original art and you had like
00:36:22 original jokes and comedy
00:36:24 and bits and stuff and you just were way more
00:36:26 creative about it um than
00:36:28 anyone else was and
00:36:30 um to this day
00:36:32 I mean you've got you've got a sense
00:36:34 of humor and a sense of comedic timing that
00:36:36 is not like anyone else and is
00:36:38 probably the best you're definitely I think I think
00:36:40 you're the best at that stuff out of any
00:36:42 of us I think that um
00:36:44 I've I've always thought that
00:36:46 uh like because hippo always
00:36:48 is is down on himself and his writing and
00:36:50 stuff but I genuinely think that he has among
00:36:52 the the funniest
00:36:54 and best writing slash editing
00:36:56 of anyone here or anyone and like
00:36:58 like it's hard to
00:37:00 put my finger on like specific
00:37:02 things but I just really like his videos
00:37:04 a lot and he's like
00:37:06 totally a unique voice
00:37:08 like yeah I've
00:37:10 never heard or seen
00:37:12 editing or delivery like
00:37:14 his by anyone else ever he's a totally
00:37:16 his own thing
00:37:18 you know like I I'll never forget
00:37:20 I think this is when I really really
00:37:22 started to like you stop it was I forget
00:37:24 which which uh pony episode it was
00:37:26 but you were just like uh talking about
00:37:28 something like and we'll be back after the break
00:37:30 and your arm just breaks and it's like
00:37:32 I like it
00:37:34 like it was oh yeah yeah I'll
00:37:36 tell you what I think after the break
00:37:38 I like it yeah it was
00:37:40 uh it was 10 out of 10 it was just
00:37:42 stuff like that in this pony
00:37:44 shit I mean you know
00:37:46 you've got it's great all right all right so
00:37:48 I love the character
00:37:50 of hippo as in the hippo
00:37:52 yeah um he is awesome
00:37:54 and every time he's in a video
00:37:56 I'm just overjoyed
00:37:58 to see him
00:38:00 he's a wonderful man
00:38:02 he is a wonderful man
00:38:04 and top 10 hippos is one of my favorite videos
00:38:06 of all time
00:38:08 yeah give your stuff
00:38:10 is just so unique you know you could
00:38:12 never mistake your content
00:38:14 for anyone else's and I'm sure you have your
00:38:16 your share of influencers
00:38:18 like people you've kind of pulled things from
00:38:20 but it's all combined in such a way
00:38:22 that just never
00:38:24 ceases to just like really like
00:38:26 intrigue and entertain me like every time I watch
00:38:28 one of your videos whether it's a give and take pony
00:38:30 or a hippo crit it's always
00:38:32 just so distinctly you
00:38:34 and in almost like I've been
00:38:36 sitting here like I don't know how do I even describe
00:38:38 my admiration for what you do
00:38:40 it's so it's like
00:38:42 beyond words the only thing is like
00:38:44 you're really great with puns
00:38:46 like your twitter everyone needs to follow your twitter
00:38:48 your twitter is a singular
00:38:50 a singular experience
00:38:52 twitter was made for you
00:38:54 the site can't be like sold or destroyed
00:38:56 because then I don't know where I'd get your puns
00:38:58 and you could find him at the hippo crit
00:39:00 right yeah the underscore
00:39:02 hippo crit right or is it all one word
00:39:04 I think it's just the hippo crit
00:39:06 yeah I think so remember just
00:39:08 it's such a it's it's cool to
00:39:10 see the things that you choose to make
00:39:12 like the first thing that you did that got
00:39:14 big was those like
00:39:16 what was it like just the
00:39:18 compilations like the pony compilations where you just take one
00:39:20 fucking who would think to do this
00:39:22 to take one word from like every
00:39:24 episode of the show and every time it's
00:39:26 and just link them back to back to back
00:39:28 and like people love them it's
00:39:30 I would just that's so
00:39:32 not something I would ever think to do
00:39:34 and it just I think it really shows
00:39:36 that's kind of like my favorite thing about hippo
00:39:38 is exactly that
00:39:40 I feel like you are almost
00:39:42 innately just like so
00:39:44 creative that it
00:39:46 like you always give yourself shit about like not
00:39:48 not writing enough
00:39:50 or not being a good enough writer but it's just
00:39:52 the ideas that make it so
00:39:54 unique that like you know I feel like
00:39:56 with with Jesse or Nate
00:39:58 everything's Jesse does have
00:40:00 some videos that are that are more just like
00:40:02 I turned on the camera and some weird shit came out
00:40:04 but like with Jesse and Nate everything
00:40:06 has to be this very formulated perfected
00:40:08 production and with you it's just like the first
00:40:10 thing that came to your mind was already a good
00:40:12 idea you know and
00:40:14 there's so many like give and take videos
00:40:16 that I enjoy just as much as the hypocrite
00:40:18 videos where it's just like
00:40:20 you went outside with a camera
00:40:22 with your brother and like
00:40:24 filmed you like running around in the grass
00:40:26 and then like did three layers
00:40:28 of green screen of like weird shit happening
00:40:30 and in every single one of them
00:40:32 I'm just like this is this is great
00:40:34 this is all they want this is this is all
00:40:36 it needs to be this is all the youtube
00:40:38 video needs to be for you remind me of
00:40:40 Gib as a crater you remind me of here
00:40:42 Amaru from from Bakuman
00:40:44 who's like this this totally
00:40:46 bizarre guy who just decided
00:40:48 to start doing manga and then it was just
00:40:50 like the best at it and like
00:40:52 he makes orders 11 hates himself
00:40:54 and he's like he hates himself and he hates
00:40:56 it but he's doing it to get that sweet Ico
00:40:58 puss so you know keep on your stuff
00:41:00 is so deliciously
00:41:02 weird like yeah when
00:41:04 when did you post a video I know what
00:41:06 it's gonna be he's gonna talk about some anime
00:41:08 he might go pretty in-depth it might
00:41:10 approach y'all at some point
00:41:14 when fuckin when when Nate post a video
00:41:16 it's like okay he's gonna make some jokes
00:41:18 he's gonna have some yucks and some fucks and some
00:41:20 yeah yeah so but but then
00:41:22 when I see like a new hypocrite video
00:41:24 I'm like I don't know what the fuck
00:41:26 kind of weird ass shit's gonna be
00:41:28 like like your your your recent
00:41:30 Mario RPG
00:41:32 video your fucking head was just sticking
00:41:34 out of the ether
00:41:36 for no fucking reason
00:41:38 it's like most people would like stand
00:41:40 in front of a green screen or like have
00:41:42 it off the side and your fucking head is
00:41:44 just like coming out of like a green screen
00:41:46 fucking vagina in the middle of the screen
00:41:48 like how you going and then you didn't even
00:41:50 mention it you didn't even like draw
00:41:52 it wasn't addressed the whole video was
00:41:54 like that I love that too
00:41:56 because hippos the best at like creative
00:41:58 solutions because
00:42:00 I mean that is a great solution to the
00:42:02 problem of the green creating solutions where
00:42:04 no problem exists yeah the
00:42:06 grpj
00:42:08 well the grpj in the beginning
00:42:10 I already thought it was a genius idea because
00:42:12 all he did was just like lay a green
00:42:14 screen over a couch just on a fucking
00:42:16 pile yeah it's like a pile and just play
00:42:18 video footage of it so it's like you would
00:42:20 think when people think green screen
00:42:22 they think you know it's it's a
00:42:24 green it's in the background you're standing
00:42:26 in front of it like a teleprompter you know
00:42:28 you're pointing stuff out but no hippos just
00:42:30 in his house on a couch
00:42:32 and there just happens to be a green screen
00:42:34 that's just playing the game it's
00:42:36 not even like lit correctly
00:42:38 or anything you know has like invented
00:42:40 and mastered a new form of
00:42:42 green screen martial arts
00:42:48 and and but the the reason the new
00:42:50 one happens is because like because
00:42:52 my brother Victor was watching it he was complaining
00:42:54 that hippos was sitting right
00:42:56 in the middle of the green screen so you couldn't
00:42:58 really make out a lot of the footage in the
00:43:00 Kingdom Hearts video and I brought this up
00:43:02 and it was like I'll find a way to do it differently
00:43:04 and so now he suddenly is
00:43:06 like just a face in a morph suit
00:43:08 he's the fucking Zordon
00:43:10 yeah he's just Zordon
00:43:12 yes that's it that's it
00:43:14 he's like it's a genius solution
00:43:16 it's not the same as talking about your animation work
00:43:18 which is just as fantastic oh shit
00:43:20 the spiders the fucking spiders
00:43:22 and there's a fish oh my
00:43:24 god a fish at my door
00:43:26 they're both really
00:43:28 great and it's a shame that
00:43:30 I know they must be really time intensive to make
00:43:32 because I wish
00:43:34 I could see more of those
00:43:36 you know
00:43:38 go ahead game
00:43:40 what?
00:43:42 I thought you were gonna say something I was gonna say
00:43:44 I've noticed in both of the
00:43:46 two big animation things you've done
00:43:48 oh okay there was actually
00:43:50 tallest man, fish at my door
00:43:52 and spiders
00:43:54 I always really love your use of
00:43:56 like I don't there's not much background
00:43:58 noise but then the sound effects are really
00:44:00 distinct I've loved your use of sound effects
00:44:02 in your animations
00:44:04 are they all fully
00:44:06 effects like did you just record them yourself
00:44:08 there's there's a quite
00:44:10 a few that I recorded myself
00:44:12 cool I got most of them from
00:44:14 freesound.org
00:44:16 yeah but um
00:44:18 yeah I mean the sound
00:44:20 I'm gonna give you a freesound.org
00:44:22 as them in the circle Jerk and I'm saying
00:44:24 oh
00:44:26 I am really appreciated
00:44:28 appreciated this is highly
00:44:30 appreciated this is highly specific
00:44:32 but there's one shot that really impressed
00:44:34 me in it's called spiders are people
00:44:36 too is that what it's called yeah yeah
00:44:38 in spiders are people too there's a shot
00:44:40 from the ground looking up a power
00:44:42 line and the power the power pole
00:44:44 line just like like
00:44:46 bends and sways
00:44:48 before like the power lines get pulled
00:44:50 taught and then snap and the
00:44:52 perspective and the motion on that
00:44:54 pole looked fantastic
00:44:56 there's a lot of great
00:44:58 the overhead shot of the spider
00:45:00 going into the house and the one where
00:45:02 it like when it strings itself up and it
00:45:04 just kind of starts turning and turning
00:45:06 back because it can't really control its momentum
00:45:08 there's a lot of adorable shit in
00:45:10 that and
00:45:12 just in everything hippo does
00:45:14 it's all about timing it's all about
00:45:16 perfect comedic timing and just hitting
00:45:18 you with the most left field
00:45:20 thing and and the fact
00:45:22 that I think more
00:45:24 so than anybody else hippo is
00:45:26 willing to completely sacrifice
00:45:28 everything for a joke where
00:45:30 where hippo will have a video where he's like
00:45:32 explaining a point and then just
00:45:34 gets bored of explaining a point
00:45:36 and would rather make a joke instead
00:45:38 and just that point is just gone it's just
00:45:40 if you think about it that kind of explains
00:45:42 his life in general he sacrificed
00:45:44 everything to be a fucking
00:45:46 joke
00:45:48 it's just I mean it's
00:45:50 so it's such a like subversive way
00:45:52 of doing it where if you watch like
00:45:54 a John Tron video you know like
00:45:56 obviously hippo comes from that camp
00:45:58 of like video makers where you talk about a game
00:46:00 and there's jokes but those people there's
00:46:02 always this very clear sense of like
00:46:04 there's the intro joke you talk about the game
00:46:06 little you make a joke you show a little scene
00:46:08 that's funny haha whoa that scene's funny
00:46:10 you make a joke you say a little analytical
00:46:12 point you make a joke hippo will like
00:46:14 just wind his way through all of
00:46:16 those he doesn't feel the need to talk about
00:46:18 every aspect of the game sometimes
00:46:20 he makes a real
00:46:22 analytical point you know which is something
00:46:24 John Tron never did you know he just
00:46:26 goofy funny man about video games but
00:46:28 even or like a you know AVGN
00:46:30 it's very much like joke analysis
00:46:32 joke analysis hippo will just
00:46:34 say something really interesting
00:46:36 some point he obviously wanted to make
00:46:38 that's the most interesting thing about the game
00:46:40 it's not encompassing the whole game because
00:46:42 proving whether the game is good or not is
00:46:44 not really what the video is about
00:46:46 it's about just here's an excuse to talk about this
00:46:48 game you know he it doesn't
00:46:50 feel like I'm getting this comprehensive
00:46:52 Mathematosis review
00:46:54 but it's also not just a joke it's like
00:46:56 here's this game I love here's
00:46:58 the thing I love about it and
00:47:00 it's got graphics
00:47:02 what's the line in a
00:47:04 what's the line in the the coyote versus
00:47:06 cheap dog one where you said like
00:47:08 it's got visuals or something like
00:47:10 that yeah something like that
00:47:12 I forgot exactly but
00:47:14 I just I just couldn't think of like
00:47:16 like usually you say
00:47:18 it's got this and that and this yeah I
00:47:20 can think of it I laughed so hard at that because it's like
00:47:22 anyone else would be like you know it's got
00:47:24 this really unique visual style blah
00:47:26 blah blah and I hate that because it's like
00:47:28 there they think that because they're doing
00:47:30 a review they have to at least touch
00:47:32 on every point even though they have nothing actually
00:47:34 to say about the visuals they just like
00:47:36 and also it's got great visuals
00:47:38 I'm like yeah I can see I don't care but you
00:47:40 you're just like yeah I don't it's got
00:47:42 a graphic you know
00:47:44 whatever yeah
00:47:46 yeah
00:47:50 I for one am deeply invested
00:47:52 in the character arc of hippo
00:47:54 and want to see I want to see if he ever gets
00:47:56 his goddamn YouTube channel up and running
00:47:58 because I always assume that that's what he's working
00:48:00 towards but they keep getting shut down by
00:48:02 the hippo crit he's like no that's not good enough
00:48:04 we gotta you know
00:48:06 he's been like a you know the
00:48:08 the lists he's been doing
00:48:10 that's sort of his I'm allowing him to put
00:48:12 them on my channel for now
00:48:14 for like exposure
00:48:16 he does want to have his own
00:48:18 you're paying him an exposure
00:48:20 oh no
00:48:22 the hippo crit organization has been exposed
00:48:24 he doesn't know what the fuck's going on
00:48:26 he doesn't have a union
00:48:30 that poor creature
00:48:32 I do let him live with me though
00:48:34 let's put a roof over his head
00:48:36 I paid cult corona exposure in a backfire
00:48:38 because everyone likes him more than me now
00:48:40 yeah that's true that's for sure
00:48:42 which I mean anyone got any closing things
00:48:44 to say about hippo crit or shall we
00:48:46 I think it's amazing that so many of us
00:48:48 have like this other alter ego
00:48:50 character that we let live with us
00:48:52 you know there's hippos got the hippo
00:48:54 Jesse's got cult corona, Nate's got action
00:48:56 draft, I've got Ben and DeVue
00:48:58 with him
00:49:04 oh my god
00:49:08 yeah it's true
00:49:10 DeVue is kind of a fiction character
00:49:12 he's not here right now
00:49:14 I rest my case
00:49:18 holy shit
00:49:20 I was just digi in a green screen
00:49:22 suit the whole time
00:49:24 exactly
00:49:26 alright give we love you buddy
00:49:28 let's move on to Jess
00:49:30 Jess I don't like anything about
00:49:32 let's talk about cult corona
00:49:34 he's my favorite character on the internet
00:49:36 he's the cutest and the strongest
00:49:38 and I just hope
00:49:40 that he counted that demon in the furnace room
00:49:46 perfect
00:49:50 I don't disagree with that at all either
00:49:52 yeah right
00:49:56 here's something serious about Jesse
00:49:58 your work ethic
00:50:00 is like a truck
00:50:02 that I fuck
00:50:04 it's real
00:50:06 it's great
00:50:08 just looking at the work that went into
00:50:10 putting aside even all the videos before
00:50:12 horseshoe finale
00:50:14 that is the seminal work of Jesse's
00:50:16 career thus far
00:50:18 a year of fucking work
00:50:20 not to mention the fucking years that went into sculpting
00:50:22 the narrative for the payoff
00:50:24 it's incredible
00:50:26 you can't even describe it to people who haven't seen it
00:50:28 it was all for nothing
00:50:30 because it can't be described to people
00:50:32 yeah that's the worst thing about it
00:50:34 you'll see that
00:50:36 that's the thing in Jesse this is something that I
00:50:38 think that you and I share
00:50:40 is that we are both completely retarded
00:50:42 and we make the things that we like
00:50:44 and we don't think
00:50:46 nearly enough about things that will
00:50:48 be popular
00:50:50 or whatever I mean maybe I'm selling you short
00:50:52 but I certainly feel that way
00:50:54 I do think about what will be popular but it just makes me angry
00:50:56 it makes me want to progress back into what I want
00:50:58 well Jesse
00:51:00 it might be true that the horseshoe finale
00:51:02 is a niche work that will never
00:51:04 find a mainstream audience
00:51:06 but to the people that it
00:51:08 was relevant to
00:51:10 it was deeply meaningful and impactful
00:51:12 and I admire
00:51:14 that a lot
00:51:16 these people that are along
00:51:18 for the ride with me
00:51:20 I'm going to show them something
00:51:22 yeah right well Jesse I think that
00:51:24 that whole plight of the artist's art
00:51:26 about you Jesse is the fact that you've taken
00:51:28 like this
00:51:30 you're just like yourself
00:51:32 like the way you interact with your fans
00:51:34 and stuff like if anybody else tried
00:51:36 to do it it would just blow up in their faces
00:51:38 but you've like sculpted your personality
00:51:40 and the way you present yourself
00:51:42 that your fans love getting shit on by you
00:51:44 essentially so you can do whatever the fuck you want
00:51:46 they've been well trained
00:51:48 yeah
00:51:50 I admire that a lot because I always
00:51:52 have to like try and think of how I'm
00:51:54 going to appease the people who follow my stuff
00:51:56 to a degree like I got to balance
00:51:58 the entire comment section is reek
00:52:00 and I'm fucking
00:52:02 I'm Ramsay Bolton
00:52:04 they know their place
00:52:06 it really is great
00:52:08 and that you know
00:52:10 you can make the content you do and actually
00:52:12 make pretty decent money
00:52:14 yeah that's what I was going to say I was time
00:52:16 even though you're a niche creator
00:52:18 you make so much more money
00:52:20 than me for example and that's why
00:52:22 is because you deeply impact
00:52:24 the people that are along for the ride with you
00:52:26 you have something to say
00:52:28 and create your own cult following
00:52:30 and they're looking at it for all it's work
00:52:32 and it's fantastic
00:52:34 and I understand
00:52:36 I completely understand why
00:52:38 your audience is so deeply invested
00:52:40 in you
00:52:42 yeah
00:52:44 I was going to say
00:52:46 I'm very impressed that
00:52:48 despite living in like a really dirty
00:52:50 poopy spider
00:52:52 spider infested basement
00:52:54 you still managed to attract
00:52:56 many winches from all over the place
00:52:58 it's very sexy with you
00:53:00 it's very cool
00:53:02 at present Jesse is the most
00:53:04 well laid of the whole PCP
00:53:06 yeah that makes me mad
00:53:08 I'm mad about that
00:53:10 it's a bit of a burden I'll be honest
00:53:12 I got plans baby
00:53:14 I'm cooking up some shit
00:53:16 I don't know what that means at all
00:53:18 I've got a witch's brew brewing in the other room
00:53:20 right now
00:53:22 we pour it like a little potion
00:53:24 and a woman's going to come out
00:53:26 like what the fuck are you working on over there
00:53:28 it's definitely true that
00:53:30 it's going to vape
00:53:32 is that what you guys are doing
00:53:34 are you practicing your vape food until you can produce
00:53:36 the white food out of the vape
00:53:38 it's definitely true that
00:53:40 like any time more than two days goes by
00:53:42 without a video from me it's probably because
00:53:44 I'm on some romantic sojourn
00:53:46 yeah
00:53:48 that's not an exaggeration
00:53:50 but literally I'll be like
00:53:52 how come I haven't heard from Jesse in like two days
00:53:54 and it's always because there's some girl at his house
00:53:56 you know
00:53:58 I said this about
00:54:00 Digi but it's also very true of
00:54:02 Jesse in different ways
00:54:04 and it's that I am
00:54:06 I've always liked
00:54:08 really
00:54:10 forceful guys
00:54:12 because I was a pretty timid guy growing up
00:54:14 and I'm not really that way anymore
00:54:16 but I really respect
00:54:18 your approach to life
00:54:20 even if we disagree on a lot of stuff
00:54:22 how you'll just you know scream
00:54:24 and cry and you know
00:54:26 pee yourself
00:54:28 about things that set you off even to the slightest degree
00:54:30 it's just a lack of
00:54:32 you know it's a double edged sort of like
00:54:34 a lack of compromise comes with shit
00:54:36 you know being tough a lot of the time
00:54:38 but it's just so cool
00:54:40 Jesse's uncompromising nature
00:54:42 is definitely remarkable
00:54:44 and my
00:54:46 uncompromising emotional instability
00:54:48 is an inspiration to all
00:54:50 like just
00:54:52 really like the story about
00:54:54 you just punching the shit out of that kid in the movie theater
00:54:56 like that's like the coolest thing
00:54:58 I've told everyone I know that story
00:55:00 like it's
00:55:02 and everyone comes away like with
00:55:04 like yeah awesome what a cool guy
00:55:06 I still haven't told
00:55:08 the Halloween story from this here at
00:55:10 Cody's butt chugger ball
00:55:12 oh shit
00:55:14 let's just say
00:55:16 I turned it into a butt chugger brawl
00:55:22 I know this one
00:55:24 I won't reveal it just yet
00:55:26 it was a ballroom blitz for sure
00:55:32 I've been influenced a lot
00:55:34 by your videos that you've made
00:55:36 at first I didn't like the idea
00:55:38 that you knew that you were influencing
00:55:40 people
00:55:42 it was an aversion to it
00:55:44 like I don't want this guy to tell me the truth
00:55:46 but
00:55:48 it was true like you were really cool
00:55:50 and I liked it and I tried doing stuff
00:55:52 and
00:55:54 I think my ultimate downfall
00:55:56 no one wants to hear the truth
00:55:58 yeah I feel like that's literally
00:56:00 there's people like clicking on Jesse's videos
00:56:02 and saying I don't want this guy to tell me the truth
00:56:06 it's really how I think
00:56:08 a lot of people feel but
00:56:10 I got over it because I'm cool
00:56:12 it's tough for some people to swallow that red pill
00:56:14 because
00:56:16 even though you're very abrasive
00:56:18 a lot of the time you're really correct
00:56:20 on a lot of things
00:56:22 even if you're not
00:56:24 I just love your
00:56:26 it's a combination
00:56:28 of your confidence
00:56:30 and
00:56:32 your emotional connection
00:56:34 to things like you embrace your emotional
00:56:36 ness
00:56:38 but you're also
00:56:40 I don't know
00:56:42 you're genuine enthusiasm
00:56:44 about things
00:56:46 is an inspiration to me
00:56:48 who struggles to feel anything at all
00:56:50 I actually
00:56:52 I feel exactly what Ben's saying
00:56:54 I've been so
00:56:56 inspired by that first time
00:56:58 we all met at BronyCon
00:57:00 I've told the story before that Jesse was
00:57:02 saying how he cried on the plane
00:57:04 thinking about Kermit the Frog
00:57:06 because for me it was such a like
00:57:08 man when was the last time I just
00:57:10 cried about a thing
00:57:12 being so good
00:57:14 you know and so
00:57:16 I've kind of taught myself more after hearing
00:57:18 about that to
00:57:20 when I see something that legitimately
00:57:22 makes me feel something to try and embrace
00:57:24 that feeling as much as possible
00:57:26 and try to really feel it and
00:57:28 convey that feeling
00:57:32 I would consider myself
00:57:34 a pretty lazy person
00:57:36 my whole life
00:57:38 up until a few years ago
00:57:40 when I found something that I actually
00:57:42 it's kind of a cheat
00:57:44 because I just enjoy making videos
00:57:46 so I didn't even really earn like the
00:57:48 hard work that I'm willing to put into it
00:57:50 but I mean the whole reason
00:57:52 that I continued doing stuff was because
00:57:54 of seeing I mean we saw that like
00:57:56 Digi, me and Ben saw that Digi was successful
00:57:58 doing this stuff
00:58:00 but even more so like the content I wanted
00:58:02 to make was stuff like Jesse's content
00:58:04 and it's been a big
00:58:06 inspiration to the kind of stuff
00:58:08 that I've been trying to make specifically
00:58:10 the way that you are able to flip
00:58:12 and like the best comedies
00:58:14 can do this between hilarious
00:58:16 and extremely heartfelt like the other guys
00:58:18 were saying like the fucking
00:58:20 like the Hulk Hogan nigger video
00:58:22 just like ah fucking
00:58:24 I said nigger you know what
00:58:26 and then it just turns into this whole world
00:58:28 fucking brother nigger
00:58:30 it's just this whole thing
00:58:32 but like the way that it all
00:58:34 it's like a swirling mass of chaos
00:58:36 and then it all spirals into one point
00:58:38 and then you get this like focused thing
00:58:40 that it was all leading up to
00:58:42 like that's the sort of thing that I have always tried to emulate
00:58:44 the delicate balance
00:58:46 the delicate balance of comedy
00:58:48 and pathos
00:58:50 and is something that I value
00:58:52 a lot in art
00:58:54 I think that's important
00:58:56 it's kind of my favorite thing
00:58:58 and the musical stuff
00:59:00 that you've put into your videos
00:59:02 that's like my favorite thing to do
00:59:04 let's talk about Jesse's raps
00:59:06 Jesse
00:59:08 I think your raps might be
00:59:10 some of your my favorite content that you make
00:59:12 and you know I like a lot of your stuff
00:59:14 so that's really saying something
00:59:16 your fucking lyrics
00:59:18 are sometimes
00:59:20 genius I'll just there
00:59:22 I said it
00:59:24 sometimes your lyrics are
00:59:26 the dandy rap to this day
00:59:28 is something that
00:59:30 I find inspiring
00:59:32 that a friend of mine could make
00:59:34 and makes me think that maybe I could do something like that too
00:59:36 I mean when I was making my keg standard
00:59:38 rap thing or it was a big mac rap
00:59:40 which turned out it wasn't great or anything
00:59:42 but I was inspired by that
00:59:44 because I thought it was so fucking good
00:59:46 I want to make things like that
00:59:48 he packs so many
00:59:50 he packs so many bright ideas into his thought balloons
00:59:52 that his metaphorical spark lights the room
00:59:54 when he expresses himself
00:59:56 he impresses you well then he don't need help
00:59:58 so why the fuck should you
01:00:00 is that a Jesse lyric
01:00:02 that's get action
01:00:04 um
01:00:06 I don't even know where to start
01:00:08 and I'm not gonna go into as much detail as I could
01:00:10 because we'd be here all day
01:00:12 Jesse
01:00:14 is my I'm gonna say
01:00:16 outright my favorite
01:00:18 artist of all time
01:00:20 and also
01:00:22 probably my best friend
01:00:24 so
01:00:26 I'm coming from a place of extreme bias
01:00:28 that there's
01:00:30 nothing that I've ever connected
01:00:32 with more than Jesse's stuff
01:00:34 and I mean it's kind of the basis
01:00:36 of all of this we formed as the horseshoe crew
01:00:38 you know we formed around
01:00:40 because he was the horseshoe king
01:00:42 we were all like we kind of bonded over
01:00:44 mutual respect for Jesse's
01:00:46 work it's I mean me and Jesse were already friends
01:00:48 and then we saw these other people and like to me
01:00:50 it was like the mark of someone being cool
01:00:52 was that they appreciated Jesse's stuff
01:00:54 the mark of the horseshoe appeared on their body
01:00:56 and they knew it was time
01:00:58 it's like the brand of sacrifice in berserk
01:01:00 you knew that you were fucked once that shit
01:01:02 I was thinking more like the Tanak
01:01:04 the Tanak and the ESD
01:01:06 you know the we have like
01:01:08 each of us has part of the horseshoe crew on our ass
01:01:10 so isn't this just actually what cutie marks were
01:01:12 isn't this the cutie mark chronicle
01:01:14 oh yeah oh my god
01:01:16 um oh my
01:01:18 yeah wait never mind I was going to say
01:01:20 oh my god tenacious D was cutie marks
01:01:22 and I remembered that that's been pointed out a thousand times
01:01:24 back in the Brody days anyway
01:01:26 um yeah like
01:01:28 for me it was my sonic rain boom
01:01:30 that gave everyone here their cutie marks
01:01:32 oh my god
01:01:34 like Jesse represents
01:01:36 everything that I
01:01:38 especially that I was trying to do
01:01:40 before you know I'm like a more
01:01:42 cleaned up presentable version
01:01:44 you know like my stuff is very
01:01:46 it's it's it's very
01:01:48 like accessible and
01:01:50 and digestible
01:01:52 and Jesse's isn't but
01:01:54 the stuff he expresses is all stuff
01:01:56 that I'm like man if only
01:01:58 I could do if I could do if I
01:02:00 had his particular set of talents this is
01:02:02 exactly what I'd want to say you know
01:02:04 everything Jesse says is something that I'm like
01:02:06 why didn't I say that why couldn't I be the one
01:02:08 to do that video you know and
01:02:10 there's so much I've taken
01:02:12 from him in terms of like
01:02:14 god everything everything to do with my
01:02:16 vlogging is you know is
01:02:18 because of Jesse essentially
01:02:20 you know with few exceptions of like little
01:02:22 things I've taken from other people
01:02:24 my rapping
01:02:26 heavily inspired by Jesse a lot of it is
01:02:28 just seeing him as
01:02:30 one of the only people I see is better than me
01:02:32 you know in like a general sense
01:02:34 like Nate's a better editor than me
01:02:36 Hippo's a better you know comedian
01:02:38 and you know Ben's obviously a vastly better
01:02:40 artist but like when I
01:02:42 think of myself in terms of like
01:02:44 my net
01:02:46 quality like
01:02:48 the only like Jesse's one of the only people
01:02:50 who I'm like I can definitively
01:02:52 say he has a better body of work
01:02:54 than me you know like I get
01:02:56 more value out of watching all of
01:02:58 his content that I would out of watching all of my own
01:03:00 content and so I
01:03:02 see it as like I have to get
01:03:04 that good I have to one day
01:03:06 be able to say I've made as many
01:03:08 good videos as Jesse or I've made as many good
01:03:10 raps as Jesse and that day will never
01:03:12 come because he's still making shit
01:03:14 you know he'd have to die for me to be able to
01:03:16 pass him you know
01:03:18 because I keep getting better but he also
01:03:20 keeps getting better where you know
01:03:22 and we have
01:03:24 now we also we influence one
01:03:26 another you know where a lot
01:03:28 of the way that we will put raps
01:03:30 together it kind of sequences into
01:03:32 each other you know we make reference to each other
01:03:34 we're
01:03:36 I can't like you can't separate
01:03:38 our artistic careers at this point
01:03:40 I mean you could but like
01:03:42 for the future but like if you looked at the
01:03:44 individual work we're doing so much of it is
01:03:46 connected I mean now we're doing like the plebe and
01:03:48 the weave which is like you know this
01:03:50 amalgam of things me and Jesse
01:03:52 are interested in and how our chemistry
01:03:54 works you know it's going to be interesting
01:03:56 when all the people who who just know about
01:03:58 you did you realize later on
01:04:00 how much of an influence Jesse was and then
01:04:02 go back and look at all his shit and are like oh
01:04:04 my god this is madness
01:04:06 yeah I mean in a good way obviously
01:04:08 like all the positive influence
01:04:10 you know I had it was a very
01:04:12 gratifying experience at
01:04:14 radcon because of the fact that you know
01:04:16 we've all hung out twice before
01:04:18 at brony con in the past you know we all
01:04:20 met at the brony con in
01:04:22 2014
01:04:24 14 and 15 we all met
01:04:26 and you know we got we all got the hang
01:04:28 out and it was it was it was a very gratifying
01:04:30 experience to realize yeah everyone's exactly
01:04:32 as cool as I thought they were you know if not
01:04:34 cool yeah and it was like wow
01:04:36 these guys really are cool guys I really do want
01:04:38 to hang out with them I really do want to be
01:04:40 friends with this group of people and to make
01:04:42 this whole you know everyone you know
01:04:44 move into one place kind of thing happen
01:04:46 but like it was at radcon where it was
01:04:48 especially that we just
01:04:50 got to actually hang out and me and Jesse
01:04:52 had never really gotten to just hang out
01:04:54 before after all these years of doing podcasts
01:04:56 together and talking all the time and stuff
01:04:58 and then like when me and Jesse
01:05:00 hung out I was like yeah I'm
01:05:02 exactly as good a friend with Jesse
01:05:04 in person as I am online you know it there
01:05:06 was no awkwardness about
01:05:08 hanging out with Jesse you know
01:05:10 when we when we were like
01:05:12 going to cook out or something together
01:05:14 and it's like this this feels like if we
01:05:16 if we did live in the same place we'd
01:05:18 hang out all the time and I was like
01:05:20 I got to get Jesse down here god damn
01:05:24 all my other friends all my offline friends
01:05:26 are gone I don't they've all abandoned
01:05:28 me so I need Jesse
01:05:30 to be my best friend
01:05:34 I'm just a left bro
01:05:36 I've got Ben and he's pretty
01:05:38 pretty good but I
01:05:40 feel like I can step up one
01:05:42 I know I'm an adequate digi
01:05:44 it's fun
01:05:46 uh yeah
01:05:48 Ben is the rebound for digi
01:05:52 no no
01:05:54 I'm a lifting buddy
01:05:56 we're lifting buddies
01:05:58 yeah I mean we hang out
01:06:00 a lot more than just to lift but
01:06:02 I got a
01:06:04 one quantifiable thing
01:06:06 that I like about you Jesse
01:06:08 is I really like your voice
01:06:10 and I love how many
01:06:12 cool voices you can do
01:06:14 some of them sound kind of similar they're always
01:06:16 they're always great
01:06:18 what do you mean they all sound similar
01:06:20 yeah we're totally different
01:06:22 is that Raphael
01:06:24 and oh no fuck is that Donny
01:06:26 and Colt are going back and forth
01:06:28 I can't even
01:06:30 the more you bring up
01:06:32 it's not that they sound too different
01:06:34 similar it's just that
01:06:36 you can go
01:06:38 from one to the other really smoothly
01:06:40 well I happen to like very much
01:06:42 how Jesse's characters all kind
01:06:44 of sound like the exact same guy
01:06:46 I enjoy that
01:06:48 well it's sort of like
01:06:50 the voices like Colt Corona
01:06:52 and Donatello exist on the same octave
01:06:54 but there's like a little bit more
01:06:56 of like an oscillation between them
01:06:58 I don't know what the word oscillation means
01:07:00 but I think
01:07:02 you just throwing some rapey vibes
01:07:04 for Donny and basically you got it
01:07:06 I can't even like I'm scared
01:07:08 to open the Pandora's box of saying
01:07:10 like specific things because like
01:07:12 there's so many little like just the fact
01:07:14 that Jesse invents memes that I will
01:07:16 then use forever until
01:07:18 chicken and tea
01:07:20 dude we all like walk around screaming
01:07:22 that now like like me and DeVu
01:07:24 like every time I go in the kitchen because DeVu only eats
01:07:26 chicken like he just fries himself
01:07:28 chicken every day and I come in he drinks tea as well
01:07:30 yeah yeah he eats chicken and tea
01:07:32 every day and I always come in and I go chicken
01:07:34 and tea
01:07:36 and I'm probably the guy who complains about
01:07:38 memes the most in the world but I'm also
01:07:40 a meme machine
01:07:42 when you make your own memes
01:07:44 it's a totally different thing
01:07:46 it's not the same as regurgitating other memes
01:07:48 which we all do from you
01:07:50 we have inside jokes and we have Twitter accounts
01:07:52 doesn't mean we're making memes
01:07:54 Endless Jess is an inside joke
01:07:56 the one group that matters
01:07:58 a big one for me is the Baba Duke stuff
01:08:00 where it's just like Jesse
01:08:02 made this bleach review like
01:08:04 two years ago where he just
01:08:06 decided to call all of the
01:08:08 all of the bad guys
01:08:10 Baba Dukes like anything that's like a
01:08:12 there's Baba Dukes and Skelly Man and Spooky Dukes
01:08:14 and then he just kept saying it
01:08:16 and eventually now in my mind
01:08:18 scary things are just called
01:08:20 Baba Dukes like that's just how it is
01:08:22 that's the world I lived in
01:08:24 that was a fascinating thing for me
01:08:26 I gotta come clean I had no fucking idea
01:08:28 what a Baba Duke was for like a year and a half
01:08:30 and I pretended that I did
01:08:32 I pretended that I understood what the fuck
01:08:34 everyone was talking about
01:08:36 it took me until like Jesse talked
01:08:38 he watched like the um
01:08:40 fuck what was it?
01:08:42 I thought it was Crampus
01:08:44 Crampus
01:08:46 I think Jesse like described what a Baba Duke was
01:08:48 like he talked about it at some point
01:08:50 and then I was like oh okay I can now pretend
01:08:52 that I always knew what this was
01:08:54 I don't understand the confusion
01:08:56 there's a movie called Baba Duke
01:08:58 and it's about a scary ghost
01:09:00 I didn't know that
01:09:02 and I chose not to investigate
01:09:04 I'm just saying like Jesse
01:09:06 will do that thing where he brings up something
01:09:08 obscure and you know
01:09:10 a lot of the time it'll just
01:09:12 seem like something he made up
01:09:14 a lot and then to learn that it's
01:09:16 you know it was based on something else
01:09:18 ironically though in the movie Baba Duke
01:09:20 the
01:09:22 Baba Duke is really more of a dookie spook
01:09:24 than a Baba Duke
01:09:26 what do you know?
01:09:28 Baba Duke's spook is one of my favorite Jesse characters
01:09:30 incidentally
01:09:32 yeah my brother really likes that
01:09:34 Baba Duke's
01:09:36 Baba Duke's spook is
01:09:38 he's like the lowest possible octave
01:09:40 of the cold corona
01:09:42 he's my favorite guy
01:09:44 and in my head
01:09:46 he also lives
01:09:48 Jesse's always saying how all the characters
01:09:50 exist and have their own lives inside his head
01:09:52 I feel like I somehow
01:09:54 I adopted Baba Duke's spook from Jesse
01:09:56 and he is a part of me now
01:09:58 he lives
01:10:00 Baba Duke lives today
01:10:02 I'm sure if Davoo were here
01:10:04 he'd talk about how the
01:10:06 environment of your basement is such a rich character
01:10:08 in of itself
01:10:10 it's filled with all these kooky characters
01:10:12 and all these things that have taken place there
01:10:14 and that is one pretty
01:10:16 awesome consequence of doing all your
01:10:18 filming in a space like that
01:10:20 I will just also say that Jesse
01:10:22 is prolific as shit
01:10:24 and if you follow all his channels
01:10:26 new Jesse content is coming out all the
01:10:28 fucking time
01:10:30 it is insane
01:10:32 and you know what
01:10:34 here's one last thing I have to say about it
01:10:36 I remember when Ben got me into
01:10:38 in like 2013 I didn't believe him that it was good
01:10:40 I watched it and found that I
01:10:42 did enjoy it very much and then
01:10:44 he also was the one who showed me all of you guys
01:10:46 which consequently is kind of what got me into
01:10:48 YouTube in the first place Ben just like
01:10:50 talking about like these pony review guys
01:10:52 that's when I really got into it
01:10:54 and I remember so
01:10:56 clearly Ben saying like dude
01:10:58 you've got to check out this fucking like crystal empire
01:11:00 review by this guy
01:11:02 like the footwear man it's fucking
01:11:04 insane you won't know what the fuck is happening
01:11:06 go watch it and I did
01:11:08 and I remember I remember
01:11:10 it was fucking yesterday
01:11:12 crawling out of that fucking rarity fun house
01:11:14 like the fucking nightmare from my darkest dreams
01:11:16 and like
01:11:18 I think
01:11:20 that was the moment I realized like holy shit
01:11:22 these videos don't have to be a bunch of
01:11:24 bullshit like this guy didgy bros doing
01:11:26 fuck that guy
01:11:28 this guy knows what's up
01:11:30 it was a paradigm shift
01:11:32 I really liked that video I did discover it
01:11:34 before I really got into the whole footwear
01:11:36 and horseshoes
01:11:38 I think that was my entry point to the footwear universe
01:11:40 yeah I want to throw in
01:11:42 I found it isolated I want to throw in one more
01:11:44 specific thing just because this is something that Jesse
01:11:46 also says it's his favorite thing about himself
01:11:48 and I also really appreciate it it's the
01:11:50 physicality of the videos
01:11:52 because in that
01:11:54 in that cold corona video and this is another one
01:11:56 that like I took as an influence and I've like trained
01:11:58 myself because I was afraid to do this before
01:12:00 that
01:12:02 Jesse comes out of that tent
01:12:04 downs a whole bottle of corona
01:12:06 in one go
01:12:08 he drinks an entire bottle of corona and then
01:12:10 just smashes it on the floor
01:12:12 he in real life did that
01:12:14 it's not a sound effect he threw the bottle on the ground
01:12:16 and it smashes the fucking pieces
01:12:18 I've sampled it in a song before
01:12:20 and like
01:12:22 that level of just willingness
01:12:24 to break shit and like make a mess
01:12:26 and you know and make videos
01:12:28 that you have to clean up after yourself afterwards
01:12:30 you know Jesse throws himself
01:12:32 through a table in one video
01:12:34 he you know just breaks a table
01:12:36 by jumping on it
01:12:38 you know several times actually
01:12:40 I think in the
01:12:42 cool cat one there's a part where you like
01:12:44 fall through something
01:12:46 he would knock bottles of beer all over the place
01:12:48 you know constantly dropping and breaking stuff
01:12:50 and like I was always
01:12:52 afraid to do something like that to like damage
01:12:54 something and then
01:12:56 like the plebe in the weeb finale
01:12:58 of episode 3 would not have happened
01:13:00 if not for that influence you know
01:13:02 the willingness to like say
01:13:04 let's fucking destroy the set
01:13:06 and that's all my stuff
01:13:08 that's getting thrown around there
01:13:10 and I wanted to go so much farther with that
01:13:12 but I was stopped
01:13:14 it felt a little strange
01:13:16 I wanted to put a sword through the fucking wall
01:13:18 I wanted to knock those walls down
01:13:20 I wanted to put like
01:13:22 I wanted to jump through them
01:13:24 have like an outline like a loony tube
01:13:26 going through the wall
01:13:28 the plan was that the most over the top thing
01:13:30 would be lighting a poster on fire
01:13:32 and that would have felt pretty extreme
01:13:34 but the fucking thing wouldn't light
01:13:36 but I like
01:13:38 even then like I mean fucking wine
01:13:40 got on everything and I was like
01:13:42 this is like my actual collection
01:13:44 that we've just soaked in all the shit
01:13:46 and I was like but it was all worth it
01:13:48 because having those things
01:13:50 is not nearly worth as much
01:13:52 as having made that video
01:13:54 that was the last ending
01:13:56 so yeah
01:13:58 I really admire that willingness to go all out
01:14:00 and just break something
01:14:02 including yourself
01:14:04 for the sake of a joke
01:14:06 my upraising was very much
01:14:08 to like never fuck up shit
01:14:10 never break anything, never do anything bad
01:14:12 and see guys like Jesse
01:14:14 or like Red Letter Media
01:14:16 who just like trash shit
01:14:18 absolutely love it
01:14:20 and that's why I would really love
01:14:22 Jesse's life, I want to study
01:14:24 what led him to be this man
01:14:26 who would you know do this
01:14:28 there's any element
01:14:30 of Jesse's videos you don't understand
01:14:32 watch like three wrestling promos
01:14:34 and it all makes sense
01:14:36 every single thing is
01:14:38 kfabe until Jesse's videos
01:14:40 and then I read the wiki article and started digging into him
01:14:42 like I get so much more of Jesse's
01:14:44 it's all just a combination
01:14:46 of like professional wrestling
01:14:48 deep-seated childhood
01:14:50 trauma
01:14:52 and a predilection towards
01:14:54 violence
01:14:56 those are the ingredients for the perfect little me
01:14:58 yeah
01:15:00 another thing to give you credit for
01:15:02 HIPPO's been trying to say something
01:15:04 I was going to say that there's a difference between
01:15:06 the Red Letter Media people
01:15:08 and what Jesse does
01:15:10 because Red Letter Media they make
01:15:12 props that they can destroy
01:15:14 and Jesse fucks up his actual living space
01:15:16 and he doesn't always clean it up
01:15:18 like if he smashes a bottle
01:15:20 it's just there for like weeks
01:15:22 and it's cool
01:15:24 there's fucking glass and you walk around without my shoes
01:15:26 and socks and a year later it goes way deep
01:15:28 in your foot
01:15:30 a huge part of the horse shoe finale
01:15:32 behind the scenes was that Jesse
01:15:34 he had ruined his whole room
01:15:36 for the sake of it and he couldn't clean it up
01:15:38 until it was done so for six months
01:15:40 he lived in like just absolute
01:15:42 squalor
01:15:44 remember that shot from rarities in main hatton
01:15:46 where he puts on the fedora, lies back in his trash
01:15:48 and just basks in it
01:15:50 and just loves the life he's living
01:15:52 I love that shot
01:15:54 I could never do stuff like that
01:15:56 just the amount of stuff Jesse's gotten me into
01:15:58 the panel cast
01:16:00 I'm now reading comics
01:16:02 wrestling podcasts
01:16:04 I mean fucking broken mat
01:16:06 you've all developed kind of an interest in wrestling now
01:16:08 yeah broken mat
01:16:10 I've never watched any wrestling my whole life
01:16:12 until Jesse's stuff
01:16:14 I opened when he started the wrestling podcast
01:16:16 that like every little thing I hadn't understood
01:16:18 about Jesse's videos all made sense
01:16:20 as soon as I learned what wrestling was
01:16:22 and how it works and how the people act
01:16:24 and I was like oh
01:16:26 that's why he does it that way
01:16:28 you know and uh yeah
01:16:30 and now wrestling is cool to me
01:16:32 and broken mat saga
01:16:34 it's like my favorite thing that's happened all year
01:16:36 yeah
01:16:38 I wonder if like
01:16:40 if you do like another top 10
01:16:42 videos of the year
01:16:44 the whole broken mat saga would go on
01:16:46 maybe
01:16:48 the last one was particularly analysis videos
01:16:50 but uh maybe
01:16:52 uh yeah
01:16:54 that's enough for Jesse
01:16:56 well guys
01:16:58 goofy
01:17:00 get out of here
01:17:02 that's all I got to say
01:17:04 yeah that's tough
01:17:06 alright well now it's your turn
01:17:08 yeah next is me
01:17:10 wait wait what are we doing
01:17:12 I just came back what are we doing
01:17:14 I'll say something about Nate
01:17:16 Nate
01:17:18 of all of us
01:17:20 you are the most not fat
01:17:22 that's very true
01:17:24 and that
01:17:26 and it pains me to say because it's such
01:17:28 an embittered
01:17:30 jealousy an envy deep inside me
01:17:32 you are a handsome boy
01:17:34 but I do take a lot of
01:17:36 inspiration in the fact that Nate actually
01:17:38 truly takes care of himself
01:17:40 and looks like a human
01:17:42 I think it's actually
01:17:44 a huge influence on the whole rest of the group
01:17:46 because I don't think
01:17:48 if we were a group of all
01:17:50 fat, slubby guys none of us would try to
01:17:52 change like we'd all see it as
01:17:54 well everyone else in the crew is but because
01:17:56 Nate is there said it like the first time
01:17:58 I met him I was like fuck why am I not
01:18:00 like you know
01:18:02 think about it like I mean we all do the same job
01:18:04 we're all YouTubers right
01:18:06 so if Nate who by the way
01:18:08 currently in school
01:18:10 and holding a full time job
01:18:12 and making videos
01:18:14 is still able to find time
01:18:16 to work out his body
01:18:18 what'd you say
01:18:20 it's elected president he's got it all figured out
01:18:22 I'll write him the best guy ever
01:18:24 for president fuck yeah
01:18:26 he's like the Paul McCartney
01:18:28 of the group oh yes that's my favorite guy
01:18:30 yes the proactive one the one
01:18:32 that tries to get all the others to be more
01:18:34 and I'm the John Lennon who beats his wife
01:18:36 yeah
01:18:38 Nate I
01:18:40 like I know we haven't even started
01:18:42 talking about your actual creative output but like
01:18:44 as a person I mean
01:18:46 okay PCP is entirely Nate's idea
01:18:48 and his child and he built it
01:18:50 and Nate has the most like
01:18:52 Nate is the most adult
01:18:54 person out of us he is the one
01:18:56 who when all of us are fucking crying
01:18:58 about I don't want to I don't know how to
01:19:00 set up a hotel
01:19:02 oh yeah
01:19:04 like you know like Brody Cod's coming in
01:19:06 Nate's like alright guys we gotta get a hotel
01:19:08 we're like I don't know how to do that
01:19:10 you fucking call them
01:19:12 you pick up a phone and you dial seven buttons
01:19:14 and you're done he sent the whole thing up didn't he
01:19:16 he's done it every time
01:19:18 every time anything happens we all just
01:19:20 defer to Nate because he's allowed us
01:19:22 to become even more infantilized
01:19:24 because I like how we all
01:19:26 have such a specialized role that
01:19:28 if one of us were gone it would all fall
01:19:30 apart immediately it's like
01:19:32 it's like the community roles like one leaves
01:19:34 and everything goes to shit you know
01:19:36 it's a delicate balance yeah
01:19:38 Nate organizes things keeps things in check
01:19:40 he's the only one who actually gets people
01:19:42 like on the fucking show every
01:19:44 week you know sets the
01:19:46 times gives a shit
01:19:48 gets the video I mean I'm the one who edits
01:19:50 all the fucking things and uploads them but
01:19:52 Nate made the channel in the first place and cared
01:19:54 enough when all of us were like yeah it's
01:19:56 no one's gonna watch our podcast and Nate's
01:19:58 like well I want to do a thing
01:20:00 you know we've had the idea let's follow
01:20:02 through yeah good follow through
01:20:04 I mean who else would actually
01:20:06 spend six months editing a video
01:20:08 and not give up on it other than
01:20:10 Jesse I guess yeah
01:20:12 because for me
01:20:14 if I work on one project for more than a month it's
01:20:16 fucking dead it's not gonna be finished
01:20:18 I don't know how you do it
01:20:20 like there are a lot of things you do in your videos
01:20:22 I don't even know how he does that in Vegas
01:20:24 yeah there's this word that starts with an
01:20:26 A coming to my mind I just don't know
01:20:28 I can't read it I can't see it
01:20:30 one thing that I
01:20:32 that I like
01:20:34 I'm particularly impressed
01:20:36 with you by
01:20:38 is that you've learned basically
01:20:40 all of your stuff since you started
01:20:42 the pony stuff like all of
01:20:44 all of your skill has nothing to do with any
01:20:46 training you just never touched
01:20:48 never edited a video before
01:20:50 T-Bab
01:20:52 let's be perfectly clear
01:20:54 everyone in our audience probably agrees
01:20:56 that Nate has the flashiest editing
01:20:58 out of all of us and
01:21:00 Nate has been making
01:21:02 and editing videos for the
01:21:04 least time of everyone in this group
01:21:06 and he taught himself all of that
01:21:08 all of us are self-taught but Nate's doing
01:21:10 the best editing and he's been doing it
01:21:12 the least time keep that in mind everybody
01:21:14 that's true that's true
01:21:16 and he has like the most outside
01:21:18 responsibility
01:21:20 yeah while doing everything else in the world
01:21:22 I watched
01:21:24 the potty cast live
01:21:26 when it starts off and you're like
01:21:28 you read the chapter name and then the screen
01:21:30 bulges out and explodes
01:21:32 and it says live
01:21:34 and I got so fucking hyped
01:21:36 because I went how did you do that
01:21:38 I don't know I don't know how to make the screen
01:21:40 bulge and explode you know I could
01:21:42 probably think of a thousand uses for that
01:21:44 but I have no idea how you did it
01:21:46 um
01:21:48 researching effects
01:21:50 just yelled so hard that it actually
01:21:52 exploded
01:21:54 I do yell a lot
01:21:56 speaking of yelling
01:21:58 I do like the fact that
01:22:00 you have a very like
01:22:02 powerful voice
01:22:04 in that you can do all that sort of stuff
01:22:06 you've got a great singing voice as well
01:22:08 and your voice acting is very good
01:22:10 I remember watching the Gurren Lagann video
01:22:12 and just the way like some of the lines
01:22:14 were delivered like which is
01:22:16 perfectly done
01:22:18 like um
01:22:20 responsibility
01:22:22 you don't love it enough
01:22:24 like the reverb you put on it just like
01:22:26 it's like perfectly punctuates that statement
01:22:28 it makes it so much more powerful
01:22:30 in all your videos
01:22:32 in all your content
01:22:34 you commit fully
01:22:36 to every joke
01:22:38 every line you deliver
01:22:40 you just completely follow through
01:22:42 with it as far as possible
01:22:44 um
01:22:46 I'm also alright
01:22:48 so my greatest
01:22:50 praise of you Nate is also going to be my greatest
01:22:52 criticism
01:22:54 the best thing
01:22:56 the best things you've ever done
01:22:58 are they have like what I was saying with Jesse
01:23:00 that blend
01:23:02 of comedy and pathos
01:23:04 the character
01:23:06 of best guy ever
01:23:08 is so steeped in that
01:23:10 deliciously
01:23:12 but there hasn't been enough
01:23:14 of it
01:23:16 and I want
01:23:18 to experience
01:23:20 the full fucking best guy ever
01:23:22 story because I know I have insider information
01:23:24 about stuff
01:23:26 and I want it realized so much
01:23:28 just so you know folks
01:23:30 Ben helped me film
01:23:32 not one but two
01:23:34 scenes that are for upcoming videos
01:23:36 like over a year ago now
01:23:38 like two years not just scenes
01:23:40 like whole fucking
01:23:42 things like we spent whole we spent
01:23:44 like entire days filming
01:23:46 yep
01:23:48 and I want those videos
01:23:50 it's coming
01:23:52 I'm sorry I'm sorry
01:23:54 Daveau would say that you are
01:23:56 Daveau has repeatedly described you as the best
01:23:58 hype man on YouTube
01:24:00 that you are more capable of
01:24:02 instantly and intensely
01:24:04 generating hype for a thing
01:24:06 I mean very true
01:24:08 and then your face freezes and the whole universe
01:24:10 shows up on screen
01:24:12 I was like I'm in for a fucking trip
01:24:14 that looked amazing
01:24:16 because honestly when you started
01:24:18 best guy ever
01:24:20 I know Nate can talk really well
01:24:22 I've watched all of the
01:24:24 t-bap stuff but
01:24:26 it's been Ben who's been doing a lot of the
01:24:28 visuals so I had no idea
01:24:30 how your videos were going to look
01:24:32 I knew you were going to say a bunch of great shit
01:24:34 but I had no idea how they were going to look
01:24:36 and I was like oh my god
01:24:38 what where has this been
01:24:40 let's just say I had a monkey
01:24:42 off my back at long last
01:24:44 what fuck
01:24:48 and once again that's a technique I
01:24:50 don't know how to do I can kind of imagine
01:24:52 how it would happen
01:24:54 the level of effort that would go into
01:24:56 what I'm thinking you had to do makes
01:24:58 my stomach churn and makes me want to die
01:25:02 I could probably like
01:25:04 find like tutorials on how to do
01:25:06 the sort of things you do I would just never
01:25:08 I would always try to
01:25:10 look for a shortcut first
01:25:12 because I don't want to have to do all that work
01:25:14 all the moving parts and transitions all happening
01:25:16 together and at the same time
01:25:18 in like an intricate web
01:25:20 of stuff
01:25:22 shit going on in the screen
01:25:24 when his face I don't know how many different things are happening
01:25:26 when you say it's going to log in time
01:25:28 and your face goes ah and the
01:25:30 title comes out and the galaxy is happening
01:25:32 I freeze the frame
01:25:34 so I pause the video I had to
01:25:36 then mask out the eyes because
01:25:38 two independently animated swirls appear
01:25:40 behind each eye the universe has
01:25:42 to fade in the words have to appear
01:25:44 in time with the music in the background
01:25:46 all these things are happening just for that one
01:25:48 and it has to come out of your mouth
01:25:50 and I had to animate it and mask it
01:25:52 properly so it's coming out
01:25:54 and then you have 20 more minutes
01:25:56 to go after that
01:25:58 let's make that line
01:26:00 that word clear animated
01:26:02 that is an animation that's
01:26:04 happening there you know
01:26:08 yeah in very impressive visual stuff
01:26:10 I wish it came out twice as frequently
01:26:12 or three times or four
01:26:14 times as frequently
01:26:16 and it's not even just that the editing is good
01:26:18 is that you spent so long
01:26:20 writing and researching and
01:26:22 with your new with your ghost in the show video
01:26:24 you've been researching so much to get it
01:26:26 absolutely perfect it's true
01:26:28 it's like you really go
01:26:30 like
01:26:32 you make it worth the time I think
01:26:34 there's nothing's worth
01:26:36 the amount of time it takes
01:26:38 I mean it's a really good
01:26:40 video like nobody could
01:26:42 make a video that good
01:26:44 I would challenge anyone
01:26:46 in the world to make
01:26:48 as about the topic
01:26:50 that the Gurren Lagann one was about to do any
01:26:52 better and nobody
01:26:54 else had their life
01:26:56 like defined by Gurren Lagann
01:26:58 the way I mean actually there's a lot of guys
01:27:00 out there and girls you know everybody
01:27:02 who loved Gurren Lagann but
01:27:04 you know it's a particular
01:27:06 it's close to your heart
01:27:08 plus like my particular love of like sci-fi stuff
01:27:10 like that's like
01:27:12 kind of the main thing it's like even more important
01:27:14 like even the video I say like yeah like
01:27:16 comment is like my favorite character ever
01:27:18 and yet he's not even my favorite
01:27:20 thing about Gurren Lagann you know it's like
01:27:22 I mean I'm just gonna say I think
01:27:24 Gurren Lagann part one
01:27:26 is one of the greatest
01:27:28 YouTube videos ever made
01:27:30 both the concept
01:27:32 and the execution of the concept
01:27:34 are perfect
01:27:36 it's the best possible idea
01:27:38 because it's I mean
01:27:40 I assume that on some level it's
01:27:42 based on the meme
01:27:44 of the four guys watching
01:27:46 Gurren Lagann right like
01:27:48 that's not a Gurren Lagann
01:27:50 specific meme
01:27:52 it was popularized partly with Gurren Lagann
01:27:54 you know that probably
01:27:56 was part of the thought process
01:27:58 right it's something it's something that's
01:28:00 kind of like you took something that's kind
01:28:02 of tied to the series already but then
01:28:04 totally made it your own and then
01:28:06 executed it so fucking
01:28:08 like because when I watched that I was like
01:28:10 okay this had to be a bunch of individual
01:28:12 shots on a green screen
01:28:14 and there's so many photos
01:28:16 and they're all taken perfectly
01:28:18 like they're all good photos but your
01:28:20 poses and your emotions
01:28:22 like it's it's you know it's acting
01:28:24 you have to show those feelings I can't
01:28:26 do that I would probably was taken
01:28:28 more than once to get it
01:28:30 yeah well here's a little insider info
01:28:32 the way I did that was I actually
01:28:34 I just filmed myself and then just did
01:28:36 a bunch of poses and freeze frame
01:28:38 on the appropriate probably
01:28:40 I was easy to get a whole bunch yeah
01:28:42 but like I mean I say easy but it
01:28:44 took me like two fucking days yeah
01:28:46 and I literally
01:28:48 could not do
01:28:50 that like because I can't emote that well
01:28:52 I can't I can't act on screen
01:28:54 and you it was hard I thought
01:28:56 that my faces were like ridiculous
01:28:58 looking but actually they were like more subdued
01:29:00 than I expected them to look that's how acting
01:29:02 is you have to like really over exert
01:29:04 it because the human face doesn't actually
01:29:06 go that crazy you know but
01:29:08 like when I was
01:29:10 watching it and the other thing is that
01:29:12 it had to be you because
01:29:14 you start this video off
01:29:16 making yourself you did all this stuff
01:29:18 like costuming to make yourself look shitty
01:29:20 and then reveal yourself
01:29:22 to be this like this
01:29:24 awesome cool Adonis in this skin
01:29:26 tight fucking
01:29:28 girl in the gun shirt you know screaming and holding
01:29:30 drills and wearing sunglasses and it's like this
01:29:32 weird trick that you pull on the audience
01:29:34 to make us think that you're some gross nerd
01:29:36 you know I showed
01:29:38 when that video first came out I showed it to my
01:29:40 my friend ghost lightning and he was like
01:29:42 you know I started this off I thought it was going to be
01:29:44 a little shit and by the end it was the greatest
01:29:46 thing ever you know and I was like that's exactly
01:29:48 what he was going for like
01:29:50 yeah it's perfectly
01:29:52 done you really
01:29:54 is the best guy
01:29:56 yeah
01:29:58 you did it you say that shit to me you're getting banned
01:30:02 we're just letting you know
01:30:04 that was to the commenters
01:30:06 I think you were being completely serious
01:30:08 no it was to you guys you're getting fucking banned
01:30:10 from the mpcp
01:30:12 anybody else want to suck Nate's dick more
01:30:16 he really is the
01:30:18 procrastinators podcast
01:30:22 you know
01:30:24 I feel that the procrastinators podcast
01:30:26 is a fitting name for something that
01:30:28 I mean that mage came up with actually
01:30:30 did she?
01:30:32 she was the one who changed the name of the other track
01:30:34 when we were on Skype she changed it to the
01:30:36 procrastinators like years ago
01:30:38 what was that like two years ago
01:30:40 we were I forgot that the reason we named it
01:30:42 that is just that the chat was already called
01:30:44 that
01:30:46 I totally forgot about that
01:30:48 we would change the name all the time
01:30:50 I remember
01:30:52 and then one time we changed it to the
01:30:54 procrastinators and then later when we were
01:30:56 deciding on like a nonpony
01:30:58 group name we just decided on that
01:31:00 because it was there but it feels particularly
01:31:02 apt to me because I was very guilty
01:31:04 of that it's funny
01:31:06 it's entirely true that like all my video stuff
01:31:08 started with the pony stuff
01:31:10 just you know fucking doing whatever
01:31:12 but um
01:31:14 like up to that point I felt pretty
01:31:16 down on myself as a person
01:31:18 because I mean at this point in my life I'm like living at home
01:31:20 had failed to get my degree
01:31:22 while all my friends had
01:31:24 and in fact I should be getting it
01:31:26 next month is when I'll be finally
01:31:28 finishing my fucking school it's done guys
01:31:30 it's fucking gonna be done
01:31:32 I can't believe it
01:31:34 I'm so I'm proud of you Nate
01:31:36 I'm very happy
01:31:38 I'm glad but it's funny that this whole
01:31:40 praising thing
01:31:42 I hate all
01:31:44 I hate myself and I see all my
01:31:46 I see all the huge problems I did
01:31:48 I'm just gonna pretend that you guys represented me
01:31:50 accurately and fully
01:31:52 oh fuck off we did
01:31:54 eat a dick you bastard
01:31:56 okay let's move on
01:31:58 we could follow this up with the airing of grievance
01:32:00 no let's record that
01:32:02 and then never release it
01:32:04 because we will all
01:32:06 not be speaking to each other anymore
01:32:08 the procrastinators will end
01:32:10 it'll be the last episode
01:32:12 the big last episode years from now
01:32:14 when we all hate each other we're all sick
01:32:16 we're like let's do it I'm done with PCP
01:32:18 we're gonna end it with a big finale
01:32:20 of everything we hate about each other
01:32:22 the last thing ever released
01:32:24 in life
01:32:26 when I wasn't speaking to anyone
01:32:28 for two months over the
01:32:30 summer I came up with
01:32:32 Jesse's like
01:32:34 five way revenge
01:32:36 and I haven't enacted it yet
01:32:38 yet?
01:32:40 but it is a real plan
01:32:42 and I have sections
01:32:44 for each of you within it
01:32:46 and I just
01:32:48 I had a change of heart and you were all spared
01:32:50 from it at the last minute
01:32:52 but it still exists in a vault somewhere
01:32:54 and I don't want it to
01:32:56 like Batman has his contingency plan for the Justice League
01:32:58 exactly
01:33:00 we ever step out of line
01:33:02 I have no doubt that it actually is real
01:33:04 I had the perfect
01:33:06 contingency vengeance for each
01:33:08 and every one of you
01:33:10 I want to see it so bad
01:33:12 I only pray Jesse that you had the foresight
01:33:14 to prepare one for yourself
01:33:16 that was the final part
01:33:18 of the revenge
01:33:20 I was like the guy in 7
01:33:22 like the last part of it is
01:33:26 okay let's move on
01:33:28 to the count of Monte Cristo
01:33:30 like you come back after 7 years
01:33:32 after we let you take the fall for something we all did
01:33:34 and then you have to get revenge on all of us
01:33:36 and like fuck all our girlfriends
01:33:38 and daughters and shit
01:33:40 we can only hope
01:33:42 for a future that bright
01:33:44 okay let's move on to our final guy here
01:33:46 Tom Oliver
01:33:48 yeah
01:33:50 Brony Curious my friend
01:33:52 I haven't heard that name in years
01:33:54 I haven't either
01:33:56 so you started YouTube
01:33:58 like at the same time as Digi
01:34:00 is that correct or did you come later
01:34:02 I'm just curious about that
01:34:04 was he first? okay it was like paleo
01:34:06 started and then you right
01:34:08 it was around the same time
01:34:10 it was around the beginning because I started
01:34:12 because paleo basically told me to do it
01:34:14 because I was talking his ear off about all this
01:34:16 like gay horseshit
01:34:18 and he was like you should just make video
01:34:20 people would care about this more than me
01:34:22 and I was like yeah but I don't make videos
01:34:24 and then it kind of became a thing
01:34:26 and I was like okay I guess I'm doing this now
01:34:28 and that's just sorry
01:34:30 I was gonna just ask
01:34:32 so what were you doing right before that
01:34:34 and this is just to where I want to start
01:34:36 talking about you
01:34:38 like if paleo started you to do that
01:34:40 what was your role before that because I just don't know
01:34:42 I was mostly focusing on drawing
01:34:44 like that's kind of like what I went to school for
01:34:46 and what I kind of envisioned myself doing
01:34:48 I never really envisioned myself being a YouTuber
01:34:50 it all kind of happened by accident
01:34:52 and now that I've started I can't really let it go
01:34:54 even though there are other things I want to do too
01:34:56 so
01:34:58 right now it's just like let's try and do
01:35:00 all of the things
01:35:02 and that's still a work in progress
01:35:04 this is not the Tommy Oliver interview
01:35:06 what I was just leading into
01:35:08 was I was curious about that
01:35:10 because I was thinking before
01:35:12 about all the stuff that you've done
01:35:14 and about
01:35:16 how awesome it is even though
01:35:18 it's just like I don't think about it that often
01:35:20 like when I think back to it
01:35:22 you made like a fucking Trixie comic
01:35:24 like a children's book that you just made
01:35:26 wait no that was
01:35:28 it was Scootaloo
01:35:30 I did a Trixie comic as well
01:35:32 it was an issue one and I never did the rest of them
01:35:34 they were supposed to be six and I did one of them
01:35:36 yeah right right but like right now
01:35:38 you run your fucking your tech channel
01:35:40 and it also happened
01:35:42 that you were a major collaborator
01:35:44 on like possibly my favorite youtube video
01:35:46 of all time which is Anthony C's
01:35:48 a cancel out wedding review thing
01:35:50 and it's just
01:35:52 looking at your body of work it's fucking
01:35:54 it's amazing that you did all this shit
01:35:56 that like all these different things
01:35:58 you know you pulled from the various
01:36:00 things you've done over your life and
01:36:02 I've always been wanting to know more about
01:36:04 I wanted to read your children's book
01:36:06 I never got around to it after this give me that shit
01:36:08 I've read it yeah it's good
01:36:10 it's extensive
01:36:12 I wanna ask you a big fucking thing
01:36:14 but let's do it later
01:36:16 anyway I wanna say
01:36:18 the Tommy Oliver interview will come
01:36:20 the interview series will be concluded
01:36:22 one day I've got something to say
01:36:24 it needs to be stated
01:36:26 that the branding and the thumbnails
01:36:28 on Rebel Pixels are the greatest
01:36:30 I've ever seen in any youtube channel
01:36:32 in history they're beautiful and
01:36:34 astounding and every time I look at them
01:36:36 I get a big penis boner
01:36:38 yeah they are pro level shit
01:36:40 yeah the professional presentation
01:36:42 is good is great
01:36:44 and it's consistent on your
01:36:46 especially on Rebel Pixels and also on Tommy Oliver TV
01:36:48 yeah how about those fucking
01:36:50 like slow movement
01:36:52 camera shots in the Rebel Pixels video
01:36:54 looking over the things yes like I know
01:36:56 that's like a twenty dollar investment but like
01:36:58 a lot of guys wouldn't think to do that
01:37:00 and it just adds so much professionalism
01:37:02 to a video like that
01:37:04 the commitment is off the charts it's awesome
01:37:06 I'm I wanna
01:37:08 I was gonna say that I kind of
01:37:10 I've always like admired your
01:37:12 your like
01:37:14 your ability to speak on podcasts
01:37:16 and in front of cameras you never seem
01:37:18 to have too much of an issue getting
01:37:20 your point across like you've always been
01:37:22 like a good talker even though
01:37:24 you may not think it because you put
01:37:26 yourself down a lot and I think you shouldn't
01:37:28 because you're actually pretty great
01:37:30 you and hippo you and hippo
01:37:32 are the same in that way I suppose
01:37:34 yeah both of you
01:37:36 like dramatically
01:37:38 undervalue yourself in comparison
01:37:40 to what your talents are
01:37:42 I mean what Jesse was just saying about the thumbnails
01:37:44 like I think
01:37:46 Tom you're like the most underpaid graphic designer
01:37:48 in the world because
01:37:50 you're doing what would be
01:37:52 professional graphic design work
01:37:54 and you could sell that to anybody
01:37:56 and they'd buy it at a real price
01:37:58 because it's real graphic design work
01:38:00 on all your channels and your website
01:38:02 you built a website from scratch with a type
01:38:04 of technology I'd never quite seen before
01:38:06 that it's like
01:38:08 webm's or something what is the
01:38:10 mechanic that your source was lost
01:38:12 uses well so those are just
01:38:14 they're just regular
01:38:16 mp4 videos but I went into
01:38:18 the auto player and they have them so they
01:38:20 automatically play instead of and when they
01:38:22 start playing as soon as they start playing they hide the controls
01:38:24 so you can't get to them so
01:38:26 they work like gifs but they're not
01:38:28 huge because a gif that big
01:38:30 would be like 15 meg would take forever
01:38:32 to download but the video is only like 2 meg
01:38:34 so they work just like gifs but
01:38:36 they're actual videos and you just go in and code
01:38:38 to hide all the UI and stuff
01:38:40 I've literally never seen a website built
01:38:42 that way before
01:38:44 and I really like it
01:38:46 like the motion comic
01:38:48 because you've been working on it forever
01:38:50 and like in each different iteration of it
01:38:52 I'd seen it and never clicked for me until
01:38:54 that website and like when
01:38:56 because they're all the same size
01:38:58 and they kind of play in this
01:39:00 natural way where you click on each new page
01:39:02 and it makes perfect sense to read it that way
01:39:04 and I was like he finally did it
01:39:06 he cracked the code he figured out how to make
01:39:08 this make sense to me
01:39:10 the way to make it work was to say fuck all of your sites
01:39:12 I'm doing it myself
01:39:14 perfect
01:39:16 speaking of the motion comic
01:39:18 it looked really good
01:39:20 I never really thought of you as an animator
01:39:22 but some of the animations
01:39:24 in the comic
01:39:26 were really swell like just
01:39:28 off the top of my head there's a close up of the monster's foot
01:39:30 like hitting the ground and then pushing off
01:39:32 as it like chases them
01:39:34 and you know it's
01:39:36 multiple frames and it moves really smooth
01:39:38 it looks good man
01:39:40 it was a talent I didn't know you had
01:39:42 until I saw it in action
01:39:44 yeah a lot of the skills
01:39:46 in that were just like because
01:39:48 like I hadn't done them before
01:39:50 it's like fuck I need to do this thing
01:39:52 I guess I have to sit here and like
01:39:54 make it work
01:39:56 the website thing I didn't want to do the website
01:39:58 but it's like well I have to because there's no other way to do this
01:40:00 and then the webm thing was like I was originally going to do gifts
01:40:02 I'm like they're too big so I guess I got to figure out
01:40:04 how to get around that so it's a lot of like
01:40:06 progress because of like necessity
01:40:08 over it. Necessity is the mother of invention
01:40:10 and that is very true on that entire website
01:40:12 I mean I
01:40:14 yeah go ahead
01:40:16 I was going to say that you seem to like
01:40:18 work really hard for like
01:40:20 to make like ideas
01:40:22 or like to
01:40:24 find solutions to problems like
01:40:26 you didn't want to draw backgrounds for your comics
01:40:28 so you just learned how to do 3D
01:40:30 oh yeah
01:40:32 you were just making 3D things and it was like
01:40:34 shit like that's a lot of work
01:40:36 I've done 3D and it's fucking
01:40:38 atrocious
01:40:40 but you got quite good at it
01:40:42 I learned quite a bit about how
01:40:44 like comics are drawn and like how
01:40:46 digital art works from watching you do it
01:40:48 on streams like I never
01:40:50 thought about what a 3D environment
01:40:52 could be used for as the background
01:40:54 of a scene until I saw you do
01:40:56 it and I was like oh yeah
01:40:58 that's yeah of course
01:41:00 like of course you can do that but who would
01:41:02 have thought to it who would have learned how to you know
01:41:04 um and
01:41:06 I definitely think you're the most multimedia out of
01:41:08 all of us I mean you can you can code
01:41:10 you can code a website
01:41:12 you can uh you can do 3D
01:41:14 you can do animations you can do
01:41:16 hand-drawn artwork you can do digital
01:41:18 uh I mean what's the word I just said
01:41:20 about the fucking thumbnails a minute ago
01:41:22 graphic design graphic design
01:41:24 typography you understand
01:41:26 um
01:41:28 like all those every single one of those
01:41:30 is like a different aesthetic skill and I think
01:41:32 it's under undervalued people think
01:41:34 of artists as like I can draw
01:41:36 good you know but like when you're making
01:41:38 the aesthetic of a whole channel
01:41:40 more going on there yeah you seem to
01:41:42 understand every single one of the component pieces
01:41:44 that Sorceress Lost has a
01:41:46 font it has a logo
01:41:48 and they all make sense and they all flow
01:41:50 into each other you know I mean I kind of
01:41:52 know looking at your stuff that
01:41:54 there's like a lot of multi-layered
01:41:56 shit going on I mean I coded my website too
01:41:58 it's not as fancy
01:42:00 it's not as uh it's not as advanced
01:42:02 as what you did with yours though but I
01:42:04 appreciate it yeah
01:42:06 actually like I used your website to help make
01:42:08 mine though oh yeah
01:42:10 cool I thought I told you but I was having
01:42:12 a hell of a time with the resizing of the buttons
01:42:14 as the screen got bigger and yours just did
01:42:16 that and I was like Ben how did you do that I don't
01:42:18 even I think the first time we talk about you like I don't
01:42:20 even know how it happened so I had to like I'd
01:42:22 go into your code and look at it like
01:42:24 or I'm gonna figure out how the fuck this worked
01:42:26 and it was like you set some value to a percentage
01:42:28 instead of an actual like number
01:42:30 and that's how they were they were shrinking
01:42:32 and stuff I scaled my divs man
01:42:34 you gotta scale those divs
01:42:36 fun fact I made a best guy ever
01:42:38 website right when I started best guy ever
01:42:40 and paid for a couple months to host the domain
01:42:42 but it has gone away because I always
01:42:44 thought I'd make it pro because the thing
01:42:46 I had was a piece a shit it was garbage
01:42:48 and I always plan to improve it but
01:42:50 I could never get anything like Ben's
01:42:52 probably because I just didn't commit enough time
01:42:54 I could like it's a fucking time commitment
01:42:56 yeah it is it's like
01:42:58 it's probably like somewhere between three and four
01:43:00 months to like make that whole thing
01:43:02 half of it was just like bugs because I remember
01:43:04 I spent like a week straight
01:43:06 of just like
01:43:08 the the footer
01:43:10 would fuck up and like certain times
01:43:12 it would like push past the bottom of the
01:43:14 the screen at certain resolutions and I had no
01:43:16 idea why for so for a week I was just like
01:43:18 googling things and typing in random code
01:43:20 trying to make that work and I was like a week of time
01:43:22 just like getting the footer that no one will
01:43:24 read to work right yeah
01:43:26 I mean I think I actually started doing
01:43:28 end cards in my videos after you did
01:43:30 like I saw the way you
01:43:32 laid out your end cards and I was like
01:43:34 I'm gonna copy that and started
01:43:36 doing it more that way because you had
01:43:38 I think you were one of the first people I saw who had
01:43:40 created an overlay graphic to
01:43:42 to frame it all in and like had
01:43:44 you know like the titles of videos under them
01:43:46 and stuff and like you know put in all these fancy little
01:43:48 things just and even beyond
01:43:50 because I could talk about you as a you know visual
01:43:52 designer but you also
01:43:54 write actual fiction
01:43:56 well which is something
01:43:58 I think only you and Jesse
01:44:00 can like do that out of
01:44:02 this group like write fiction
01:44:04 novel stuff
01:44:08 you did this fanfic this
01:44:10 like extensive novel length
01:44:12 fanfic and I remember reading it
01:44:14 and being like Tom you can actually
01:44:16 write why don't you do this
01:44:18 and you were like I want to but I'm
01:44:20 tethered to these five
01:44:22 YouTube channels and all this other shit
01:44:24 I'm actually writing I think I might do
01:44:26 sorceress lost as the novel
01:44:28 it's switch format so many times
01:44:30 so what I'm thinking right now
01:44:32 you're only five days late for nano-remo dog
01:44:34 I know
01:44:36 I wanted to start that but like I have
01:44:38 some friends coming over for a week for my birthday
01:44:40 so I'm like I can't nano-remo while they're here
01:44:42 because that was the plan I was going to go from
01:44:44 Inktober straight into that because I was like
01:44:46 I have like ten old story ideas
01:44:48 from high school and college that I've abandoned
01:44:50 like that'd be cool if I just nano-remo'd
01:44:52 like each one of those and just shit them out as like
01:44:54 garbage like I finished this idea from
01:44:56 like a decade and a half ago even though
01:44:58 it's like total trash so that
01:45:00 could be interesting but I'm thinking the
01:45:02 motion comic just takes so much work and I
01:45:04 really enjoy doing it but I hate
01:45:06 the fact like I really enjoyed working
01:45:08 on it up until I posted it
01:45:10 and then it's like you have to update this like on a
01:45:12 weekly basis or like now you're on a time limit
01:45:14 and like time limit is stressing me out
01:45:16 so I'm just like I want to like do those
01:45:18 like kind of like in short bursts and just like
01:45:20 have like a couple things like oh this is just like
01:45:22 a little advertisement or a little like
01:45:24 it's Overwatch totally influence me
01:45:26 the way they're marketing Overwatch is brilliant
01:45:28 because like their entire advertising campaign is
01:45:30 not canon because it has nothing to do with the game
01:45:32 at all I hate that
01:45:34 it's more like the game isn't canon to the series
01:45:36 like the game is just nothing related to the actual characters
01:45:38 the game is like
01:45:40 it's completely I
01:45:42 enjoyed the videos they make for the game
01:45:44 more than playing the game but like
01:45:46 they made a super smash brothers and then just
01:45:48 none of the characters are from anything else
01:45:50 they're just like now they're fighting
01:45:52 it's really weird because like none of it even makes any
01:45:54 sense in the lore that they're like putting all this
01:45:56 kind of effort into because like they have like
01:45:58 these two groups of like you know the Overwatch guys
01:46:00 and the Talon guys and then you can be them on the same team
01:46:02 and be buddy buddy or just like
01:46:04 inspired by the genius writers
01:46:06 over at Riot Games to make League of Legends
01:46:08 you know there used to be a reason why all the characters fight
01:46:10 got retconned out now there's just
01:46:12 no reason why they fight it's just they just
01:46:14 are doing it what is that right what are you
01:46:16 fucking doing I'm sorry
01:46:18 they got a few schools
01:46:20 that's all they care about but like
01:46:22 there was a reason as they
01:46:24 advertised something
01:46:26 completely different from what you're buying but you got attached to the characters
01:46:28 I was like what if I do a bunch of
01:46:30 just focusing on these characters doing like short
01:46:32 little endearing things
01:46:34 and then if I was just writing a novel about like
01:46:36 them like the actual story
01:46:38 like now you like the characters so you'll
01:46:40 read it you fucking hate reading because
01:46:42 everybody under the age of 25 hates
01:46:44 reading
01:46:46 if you make it a light novel you could go to Japan
01:46:48 well my whole thing is right now I'm starting like
01:46:50 really small I'm like if I can write a better story
01:46:52 than Reki Kawahara like I'm good like that'll be
01:46:54 my that's my first stepping stone
01:46:56 if I can do better than that
01:46:58 whatever he gets a good artist and
01:47:00 he's she gets popular for whatever reason
01:47:02 Tom I was going to say that
01:47:04 you know they were saying that I do
01:47:06 you know adult sorts of things
01:47:08 professional type of stuff but you
01:47:10 continue to me impress me with your
01:47:12 like the way that you reach out to the
01:47:14 tablet companies and we talked about this before
01:47:16 how you get them to send fucking
01:47:18 free shit yeah that's the
01:47:20 that's the best I don't know awesome I don't know how
01:47:22 I would even go about doing that and it's great
01:47:24 it's incredible I would just assume that
01:47:26 they wouldn't it wouldn't try and hope they
01:47:28 reply but you know the
01:47:30 the the chutzpah it takes to
01:47:32 reach out to do that I just I wouldn't have even thought
01:47:34 that's the thing but I mean maybe you just
01:47:36 had done research and know they would do it but nonetheless
01:47:38 that is pro shit and I
01:47:40 I seek to emulate it because it's good stuff
01:47:42 it's pretty cool there's actually
01:47:44 I found recently a website
01:47:46 where you can go on
01:47:48 there you sign up for an account and you have to like make
01:47:50 your Amazon because it's all through Amazon make your Amazon
01:47:52 account get nice and pretty and then you can
01:47:54 get discounted things that vendors want
01:47:56 you to review on Amazon through there and they'll
01:47:58 just kind of like 50% or give you them for free
01:48:00 50% that's not bad so I'm
01:48:02 like looking through there now it's like not like super
01:48:04 expensive I'm gonna be like here's a 4K TV
01:48:06 for like 90% off but there's like smaller
01:48:08 things so like I don't know and then I want to
01:48:10 I'm trying to like make Rebel Pixels
01:48:12 like more professional like I just got this like
01:48:14 handheld gimbal for the DSLR so you can be
01:48:16 like walking shots I don't have to be stuck in my
01:48:18 basement like I'm gonna get
01:48:20 my friend I'm like you I want to do a review on the
01:48:22 Surface Pro 3 so I want to get like super
01:48:24 pro and be like I'm gonna walk around town
01:48:26 like go to places and use this you just have the
01:48:28 gimbal and follow oh that's that's classy as fuck
01:48:30 super sexy is gonna be great
01:48:32 dude the thing you did with somebody I don't
01:48:34 maybe it was like your sister something but
01:48:36 someone was filming you when you went to the
01:48:38 store to test out the tablet
01:48:40 in like the Apple store like the new
01:48:42 thing that was announced or Microsoft store
01:48:44 I brought I brought that was awesome
01:48:46 I brought the tripod and the
01:48:48 slider and just set them up like in front of it
01:48:50 and just like I just record over there for like
01:48:52 and they're like yeah fine I was wondering
01:48:54 what they said about that they were they were
01:48:56 surprisingly chill I was like expecting to be
01:48:58 like the fuck's wrong with you they were just like
01:49:00 oh it's the hundredth youtuber is in to
01:49:02 film our fucking shit yeah
01:49:06 but yeah that was that was fun
01:49:08 cool
01:49:10 where's did you die looks
01:49:12 he died he's dead
01:49:14 he's dead well I think is
01:49:16 Tom I'm just curious about so
01:49:18 professionally where do you see your career
01:49:20 going right now are you are you looking to pursue
01:49:22 you know go hardcore with the tech
01:49:24 stuff with rebel pixels or are you going to
01:49:26 like split your time between that and doing
01:49:28 sorceress loft stuff what's your what's your
01:49:30 focus right now I
01:49:32 my problem is I can't really focus on it
01:49:34 that's why I'm saying like I really admire
01:49:36 what Ben can do he's like I'm going to do
01:49:38 the champion and then like that's all he did
01:49:40 and like didn't I'm like one of those people
01:49:42 that like I thrive off of feedback so I
01:49:44 constantly have to be putting stuff out to like
01:49:46 feel better about my like own existence
01:49:48 so if I just sat there in a room
01:49:50 for like five months and did nothing and I
01:49:52 had no like I mean contact with
01:49:54 humanity I just like my own like
01:49:56 self doubt would be to wait me because I've been
01:49:58 writing this first chapter
01:50:00 and I've gotten way farther with it I
01:50:02 ever did with the comic it's like
01:50:04 everything that would have taken forever
01:50:06 but like the whole time I've been writing it for like
01:50:08 six months have been like this is garbage this is
01:50:10 crap this is like not good I know
01:50:12 the feeling but I really want you to
01:50:14 work through it because I know I've heard you
01:50:16 stream talk about like you know
01:50:18 the characters in the story and the setting
01:50:20 in the world and stuff and I know that there's a
01:50:22 lot going on there
01:50:24 and I just want you to get it out
01:50:26 I want you to write it or
01:50:28 you know put it out there by any means necessary
01:50:30 well I'm hoping that
01:50:32 as soon as this podcast is done
01:50:34 I'm sitting down and I'm finishing the first
01:50:36 draft because it's like 95%
01:50:38 done it's like 12,000 words
01:50:40 that's awesome so
01:50:42 that will be done and I'm going to send
01:50:44 it out to a couple people get some edits and then hopefully
01:50:46 I'm hoping it'll be out
01:50:48 by the beginning of next year I'd love to
01:50:50 like start 2017 off with the banks like here we go
01:50:52 yeah man pay attention
01:50:54 it's cool you know it's funny
01:50:56 to me that you brought up the like wanting
01:50:58 to do things that are faster that was my exact
01:51:00 reason for starting to do
01:51:02 YouTube like seriously because
01:51:04 in school I had done I was a programmer and done
01:51:06 game design and realized that
01:51:08 I hated it because it took like years
01:51:10 to release anything to anyone that wasn't
01:51:12 total garbage and was like polished to a reasonable
01:51:14 level so I abandoned that shit
01:51:16 and now I'm like the guy who takes 6
01:51:18 months to finish a fucking video
01:51:20 I hate it it's not
01:51:22 what I signed up for but
01:51:24 nonetheless nonetheless
01:51:26 that's how you just do bestie boy vlogs
01:51:28 yeah I gotta probably work with the next master piece
01:51:30 I gotta talk
01:51:32 I wanna talk about what uh
01:51:34 I wanna talk about what is like
01:51:36 the biggest influence that Tom
01:51:38 had on me and in turn
01:51:40 that I had on all of you
01:51:42 that you might not even realize
01:51:44 because
01:51:46 Tom, Tom's the first
01:51:48 person I met like as a
01:51:50 video maker like the first friend I made
01:51:52 as someone who made videos
01:51:54 you know I hadn't like
01:51:56 I was new to you talking about your history
01:51:58 yeah well I was I was new to YouTube
01:52:00 I started making videos he was doing the same kind
01:52:02 of thing at the same time
01:52:04 and we both became aware of each other like
01:52:06 fairly early on
01:52:08 and started collaborating and stuff
01:52:10 and we became friends we started talking on Skype and shit
01:52:12 and the
01:52:14 the most important
01:52:16 thing to happen to me and Tom
01:52:18 in this early period was that we both
01:52:20 were trying to become
01:52:22 like professionals in this we wanted it to be
01:52:24 a career but this is when Hasbro
01:52:26 started like taking all you know started
01:52:28 uh marking everyone's videos and shit
01:52:30 so I had gotten
01:52:32 um you know I had just
01:52:34 I had left my job to do YouTube
01:52:36 making like $600 a month through ad revenue
01:52:38 the first couple of months which is crazy that I
01:52:40 did that well those two months but like
01:52:42 I don't even yeah lucky to make
01:52:44 that much now well that's not true anymore but
01:52:46 for a long time I'd be lucky to make that much
01:52:48 but like I got monetization disabled
01:52:50 completely and so me and Tom were like
01:52:52 how are we going to make money
01:52:54 from this you know like we started
01:52:56 basically me and Tom were going to make
01:52:58 something kind of like
01:53:00 the horseshoe crew or the PCP where we were
01:53:02 like gonna you know market ourselves
01:53:04 as this team
01:53:06 we were gonna build a website and try to make
01:53:08 some kind of system where people could pay like
01:53:10 on a monthly basis to access
01:53:12 try to make a kick stuff we did we had a whole
01:53:14 document right out there yeah kind of like exactly
01:53:16 what happened we believed in the weed we were gonna do yeah
01:53:18 it was almost exactly like that 2012
01:53:20 2013 or something yeah and like the high
01:53:22 like we had like this like crazy
01:53:24 like our goals had like this huge
01:53:26 escalation where a few if we got to the
01:53:28 certain amount like $45,000
01:53:30 and we would just move in together and make
01:53:32 blogs every day and stuff like that
01:53:34 so yeah
01:53:36 but we had all these
01:53:38 different plans to try to make money and
01:53:40 then around this time
01:53:42 when all this stuff was going on Tom
01:53:44 found Patreon
01:53:46 and if it
01:53:48 weren't for Tom finding Patreon
01:53:50 I wouldn't have a Patreon and none
01:53:52 of you would have known about Patreon
01:53:54 so that's true yeah like the whole
01:53:56 idea of like let's try to
01:53:58 find a way to get people to be able
01:54:00 to pay for this was very much like Tom's idea
01:54:02 it was like I remember this
01:54:04 I was watching this is like when I first
01:54:06 got into you guys when this this whole
01:54:08 shit was going down I remember it very well
01:54:10 I think the I think the t-bat Patreon
01:54:12 was largely modeled on
01:54:14 Tom's Patreon it was modeled on Tom's
01:54:16 now you mentioned it was like totally
01:54:18 I forgot about that but it's the truth
01:54:20 because Tom Tom knew a lot more
01:54:22 about like marketing and
01:54:24 business kind of stuff than I did at the
01:54:26 time not that either of us knew a lot
01:54:28 but you know he was
01:54:30 he also like Tom knew more about
01:54:32 like trying to merchandise and stuff we tried
01:54:34 to launch TV t-shirt stuff
01:54:36 it didn't go very well but like
01:54:38 what is it
01:54:40 Alicorn Princess
01:54:42 well Tom also had a whole t-shirt website
01:54:44 that he was running at the time that like
01:54:46 that's kind of amazing because Patreon is
01:54:48 like the cosmic radiation
01:54:50 that gave us all our fantastic four
01:54:52 powers yeah
01:54:54 yeah
01:54:56 like it was it was all just like
01:54:58 me going Tom like what do I do
01:55:00 I can't make money and he him going
01:55:02 me either bro let's figure it out
01:55:04 you know and like we were we were gonna
01:55:06 become this like this duo of
01:55:08 of finding a way to make
01:55:10 money but then Patreon showed up and Tom was like
01:55:12 well this works and we were like oh okay
01:55:14 I guess we'll use that
01:55:16 and we've been using it ever since and all
01:55:18 of our careers are based around it
01:55:22 not to mention the meme of you guys
01:55:24 being gay for each other
01:55:26 that is a meme that has persisted
01:55:28 and only grown
01:55:30 that meme is expanded to contain all of us
01:55:32 yeah it's so great that the
01:55:34 PCP gives gays more representation
01:55:36 in the media
01:55:38 it's kind of shocking how little of that
01:55:40 there is now because me and Tom had
01:55:42 lots of gay stuff
01:55:44 like made about us
01:55:46 it was just a brownie thing
01:55:48 totally a brownie thing
01:55:50 and uh
01:55:52 should we try to
01:55:54 like us the artists in the audience
01:55:56 to start doing more gay
01:55:58 I don't necessarily want it
01:56:00 I don't think we need to ask I think this podcast
01:56:02 is already gonna jump start
01:56:04 this is the circle saturation
01:56:06 it is
01:56:08 I'm sure we're gonna get a circle jerk illustration
01:56:10 this is a strong image
01:56:12 and by the way guys
01:56:14 some strong bold images
01:56:16 make sure to draw my dong the biggest
01:56:18 I should have done this at the beginning
01:56:20 the tradition I went to urban dictionary
01:56:22 and looked up circle jerks so it will indulge me
01:56:24 have a listen
01:56:26 now this is a two part thing so be patient
01:56:28 so number one when a group of males
01:56:30 sit in a circle jerking each other off
01:56:32 okay standard but part two
01:56:34 clarifies not
01:56:36 it stresses this is not what it is
01:56:38 when a group of males stand in a circle to jerk off
01:56:40 onto a cookie or anything of the sort
01:56:42 that retarded frat game
01:56:44 is in fact called limp biscuit
01:56:46 which kind of imply which is why
01:56:48 the namesake of the band is so horrible
01:56:50 you know
01:56:56 there you go
01:56:58 we got something to do for retcon too
01:57:00 we're gonna limp biscuit it up
01:57:02 the limp biscuit podcast
01:57:04 get down with the sickness you mother get up
01:57:06 come on get down with the sickness
01:57:08 the limp biscuit podcast
01:57:10 not about the band
01:57:12 look forward to it
01:57:14 alright well are we wrapped up
01:57:16 cut my life
01:57:18 into pieces
01:57:20 this is my last resort
01:57:22 I'd like to say
01:57:24 in closing that you guys are
01:57:26 probably the most
01:57:28 important
01:57:30 people who have affected me
01:57:32 in my life up to this point
01:57:34 and I'm really glad to know all of you
01:57:36 and makes me happy
01:57:38 that I can be involved in your lives
01:57:40 in whatever way and we can do things like this together
01:57:42 same for me I'm really happy
01:57:44 and I feel lucky all the time
01:57:46 to be a part of this
01:57:48 gay little circle
01:57:50 that even jerks
01:57:52 like someone pointed out before
01:57:54 I tend to choose my friends
01:57:56 I seek out people who I feel
01:57:58 are better than me at something
01:58:00 none of you
01:58:02 are as good as me at most things
01:58:04 but at something
01:58:06 most of you have one talent
01:58:08 that is useful to me
01:58:10 I choose my friends
01:58:12 like I choose my women
01:58:14 that I can beat them into submission
01:58:16 everyone here is definitely better than me
01:58:18 at least one thing I agree
01:58:20 we're a robust little group
01:58:22 it's true
01:58:24 you're all my best friends
01:58:26 you're all my best friends
01:58:30 for me
01:58:32 a huge part of what makes the PCP
01:58:34 what it is and I've said this before
01:58:36 is that we're all united
01:58:38 we're all trying to do
01:58:40 kind of the same thing
01:58:42 we all want to be successful through creativity
01:58:44 and the glue
01:58:46 that holds it all together
01:58:48 is that we actually like one another's shit
01:58:50 that's the most important quality
01:58:52 of the
01:58:54 particularly of this core
01:58:56 PCP
01:58:58 is that we all really like one another's work
01:59:00 I love Ben's comics
01:59:02 I love Nate's videos, I love Hippo's videos
01:59:04 I love Jesse's videos and I love Tom's
01:59:06 things he actually puts out when they happen
01:59:12 and I love you guys's
