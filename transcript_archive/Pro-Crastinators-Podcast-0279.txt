00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP, listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream, I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.
00:00:31 I've got CeCe, the Tails gets trolled, Brand Manager, and Tectonic Improv, YouTube, boy.
00:00:41 That's right, hello, I'm back, finally. All the negative is over, I've returned.
00:00:46 Yeah, I'm just looking at your channel right now because I've never seen it.
00:00:50 Oh yeah, you should check out the lecture on The Linkara, or by the top of the 4th wall is worth checking out. Other stuff too.
00:01:02 Play Donkey Kong 94, yeah, I agree with that.
00:01:06 Yeah, it's a great game.
00:01:08 Man, those other games that came out after, like the Mario vs Donkey Kong shit, that shit sucks.
00:01:15 I know that the first Mario vs Donkey Kong is a lot more like Donkey Kong 94, but I know they do like the mini, they like spun it off into its own like other gameplay style, like the mini stuff.
00:01:29 I only played one of those, I didn't hate it, but yeah, it's a, it's a cry.
00:01:33 Even when the first one, like the whole aesthetic is like messed up, like the music is like really bad, it's like MIDI, it sounds like a 1994 MIDI.
00:01:46 That was a coincidence, I picked a random year and it just happened to be 1994. That wasn't intentional.
00:01:54 I believe it.
00:01:55 I just mean like a Windows 95, Windows 3.0 MIDI.
00:02:00 Yeah, yeah.
00:02:01 What about Windows, what about Windows 3.11 for work groups?
00:02:06 Oh, what?
00:02:07 Windows ME?
00:02:08 Nobody knows about Windows 3.11 for work groups, that was what my computer had on it as a kid.
00:02:15 Rare, it was a rare Windows.
00:02:18 Actually, the first Windows my family had was Windows 3.1.
00:02:24 Well, mine was better by exactly .01 for work groups.
00:02:30 Yeah.
00:02:31 Yeah, those are the days.
00:02:32 Before we get, before we get into anything else, I want to make an announcement about the RADCON, the Road to RADCON books.
00:02:40 I put out the message like a week or two ago that we need, that we're sending this apple, we need people who have changed their address to update their addresses.
00:02:50 I'm making a deadline this weekend, the weekend that this episode comes out is going to be the deadline.
00:02:57 If you have not updated your address on the Kickstarter by sending us a Kickstarter message about your new address, I'm just going to send it to the old address.
00:03:05 So just, just don't fucking wait on that if you still got to do it.
00:03:11 Any other good news is those will be going out in the mail hopefully next week.
00:03:16 So that'll be, that'll be fun and get those fucking, get those sent out.
00:03:22 But speaking of physically released books and media, CC, I asked you if you wanted to be on this episode to talk about how you, in collaboration with Laserbot, just released the, the, the, I think the first volume of the official Tales Gets Trolled print edition, right?
00:03:41 That's big news this week.
00:03:44 Yeah, speaking of, I'm just, I'm going to continue talking about Tiktok improv right now and then I'll talk about that.
00:03:51 Yeah, I'm a side Laserbot. Okay, there's a new hotness in town. CC's going to be my brand manager from now on.
00:03:59 We're going to get all of my videos published on Amazon.com featuring Kindle variants.
00:04:05 Yeah, we'll, we'll put them on Blu-ray. But anyway, apparently I was already subscribed to you, which is perfect.
00:04:13 Yeah, I guess I watched, I watched some of your videos before, though I don't remember which ones.
00:04:18 There's a couple videos that got kind of big that could have, that could have conceivably, you could have found me.
00:04:25 Very funny how we were talking about, we were talking about the duck universe that one week and then like, like that, like that very week you put out that the fuck, what's the character?
00:04:36 No, no, it, I, I didn't put that.
00:04:38 I was older than that?
00:04:39 Yeah, it was like over a year old. I just, when you guys were talking about Maui Mallard and like couldn't figure out his name, I was like at work being like, these simpletons, they don't even know about Maui Mallard in cold shadow?
00:04:50 Nobody, nobody knows about Maui Mallard.
00:04:53 Uh, yeah, kinda. But they should.
00:04:56 Does he, does he even, does he even exist in like other duck stuff?
00:05:00 I don't think he does. I think they were like trying to set something up with that sort of character.
00:05:07 Like, cause like, um, cause you know, Donald Duck has like a lot, they, they always like give him like different identities.
00:05:14 Yeah.
00:05:15 And I guess Maui Mallard was this one that never really stuck, cause it's only the game.
00:05:20 And in um, well is it, in like other regions it's called Donald in Maui Mallard, which makes it even more confusing.
00:05:27 Cause he's like, it's Donald like playing the character of like an action star in a movie that is Maui Mallard.
00:05:36 Yeah, cause, cause like Disney would, Disney would do that stuff all the time back in the day.
00:05:40 Like it would be like, well, cause they've done like stuff like the Mouse Keteers and stuff, right?
00:05:44 So it's Mickey Mouse playing a character.
00:05:47 I guess it's not that crazy.
00:05:49 Yeah, like um, the old uh, the old um, Disney shorts where like they had Jack and the Beanstalk with like Mickey Mouse and shit.
00:05:59 Yeah, it's exactly like that.
00:06:01 Although it's a little, it's a little weird because there's more layers to it because it's Donald Duck playing a guy, a duck called Maui Mallard,
00:06:10 who disguises himself as a character called Cold Shadow.
00:06:13 So it's like, it's two, it's, it's layers upon layers of this.
00:06:16 So I can see why people would be confused, including myself back in the day.
00:06:20 I guess probably like cartoon, like animation studios like Disney or whatever,
00:06:26 they would make shorts where they put their characters in these like, you know, public domain, iconic roles, Jack and the Beanstalk or whatever.
00:06:34 And then probably at some point someone had this very meta idea of be like,
00:06:39 hey, what if we like kind of break the fourth wall and call attention to it and sort of establish that like, yeah, these characters are like,
00:06:45 they are performers that work for Disney that like they, they are, they kind of do acting sort of like they're, they're consciously acting these roles in these things.
00:06:55 And then that's probably why like the Muppets are like that too.
00:06:58 There's sort of like a parody of that kind of thing.
00:07:01 I don't know.
00:07:02 I believe, oh sorry.
00:07:04 The first time they made Mickey Mouse be Jack and the Beanstalk, they probably didn't even think at all about it.
00:07:10 But then by the time in the modern era, I think they were like, we have to, we, I don't know, there was like,
00:07:16 I remember when I was a kid, there was something called House of Mouse,
00:07:19 which was sort of like a Muppets style thing where it's like all the Disney characters hanging out at like a club and they're like,
00:07:25 oh, we're putting on a show or whatever.
00:07:27 Yeah.
00:07:28 So meta.
00:07:29 I remember that, yeah.
00:07:33 What I like, well, first of all, like the game, watch my review everyone.
00:07:37 But the game is like kind of clunky, but overall, I think it's really, it has, it has a lot of charm, like the graphics are really good.
00:07:48 And the music is like excellent.
00:07:51 And it's by a, what was it, Michael Chiquino did the soundtrack to the game and he like went on to do the fucking Lost soundtrack.
00:07:59 All like a lot of Pixar films.
00:08:01 Lost like the show?
00:08:02 Yeah.
00:08:03 Like the TV show Lost.
00:08:04 Mali Mallard was one of his like first things that he ever did, which is really weird.
00:08:09 So he moved on to bigger and better things because we all know video games are for children.
00:08:17 That's right.
00:08:18 He seems like kind of still, there's not a lot of like interviews talking about him about the game.
00:08:25 But you know, I think there's one where he like kind of brings it up and he seems like he's pretty proud of it.
00:08:29 So that's cool.
00:08:30 Yeah.
00:08:31 But please enough about me.
00:08:35 I want to hear about Tails gets trolled physical.
00:08:38 For I want, I want, I have a quick question.
00:08:43 You see, he wants to talk about anything other than the tails gets trolled.
00:08:47 This is going really.
00:08:48 Yeah, that's right.
00:08:49 It's kind of like how you, how when you're like eating dinner, you kind of want to save like the main course for later.
00:08:56 Sure.
00:08:57 Well, it's partly that, but also like people know me as the tails gets troll guy.
00:09:00 But you know, I'm kind of tired of talking about tails gets trolled.
00:09:03 Oh, sure.
00:09:04 Sure.
00:09:05 Yeah.
00:09:06 I could see, you know, getting kind of pigeonhole.
00:09:07 Well, I mean, I still, I still like tails gets trolled, but you know,
00:09:12 um, but it's, it's, this is a really quick question though.
00:09:15 But you guys were, you guys were talking about a Mali mallard on like the podcast where he had like six people, right?
00:09:23 I think so.
00:09:24 It was like Cybershell, Gamers Tavern, Tom and because I actually remember that I didn't listen to the whole thing.
00:09:30 Just part of it.
00:09:31 And I remember when you said duck stuff, it kind of sounded like you said butt stuff.
00:09:37 I'm sorry.
00:09:38 I'm sorry.
00:09:39 I didn't.
00:09:41 But yeah, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
00:09:43 That's a, that's the bonus episode.
00:09:45 That's the bonus.
00:09:46 Yeah.
00:09:47 I was going to, I was going to say something else, but I don't remember what it was.
00:09:51 So speaking, speaking of bonus episodes, speaking of bonus episodes, the, oh yeah, the other, the other news item is I finally got around to releasing the bonus episode, the two behind the scenes episodes and then the one other behind the scenes episode, the post show
00:10:07 goss talk, the one where I have been, have been talking about for like a month and a half where I ran at Cybershell for like hours.
00:10:16 That was, that was an epic episode.
00:10:18 About Trixie.
00:10:19 It was, it was, it's finally out.
00:10:21 And also I updated the Patreon, the model.
00:10:24 It's no, the people, people just had the playlist.
00:10:27 Like nobody needed to subscribe to get the playlist.
00:10:29 It was, it was just out there floating around.
00:10:31 So I killed the playlist.
00:10:32 The playlist is dead.
00:10:33 Now the way to get the bonus episodes is you have to be a patron.
00:10:36 You have to look at the Patreon page.
00:10:37 You have a master post that lists all links to all the bonus episodes are there.
00:10:41 It's the only way.
00:10:42 So I don't know whether it was one thing like that I released this bonus episode that I had hyped up, the, the, the goss one.
00:10:49 Or that I had, or that I finally got around to updating the, you know, the, the distribution model or whatever.
00:10:56 But these two things in combination, our Patreon like exploded a little bit.
00:11:03 When I, it jumped up like $160 or something in like, in like three days.
00:11:08 Which is like, that's pretty, that's pretty good.
00:11:11 That's pretty good.
00:11:12 Oh yeah, I get a couple of bucks.
00:11:13 So I'm excited about that.
00:11:14 I guess I wanted to.
00:11:15 So, so become a patreon.com slash the procrastinators if you want to get that stuff, like everyone does.
00:11:21 It's the hot new thing on the market.
00:11:23 It's pretty good.
00:11:24 They, they, they talk hot goss on it.
00:11:27 There is, there is hot goss.
00:11:29 Although it's not, I remember it as the episode where I did like four hours of just Trixie talk.
00:11:34 It's actually, we kind of like move back and forth.
00:11:36 It's probably maybe half, maybe half an hour.
00:11:38 I think it was longer than the actual episode.
00:11:41 It's close because it's, it's long.
00:11:44 It's long.
00:11:45 I was actually there and I didn't really have, I didn't really have much to say because I don't know anything about Trixie besides before she, you know,
00:11:53 before she, like I, like I watched her videos before she like went, did the stuff.
00:12:01 Went.
00:12:02 You know, you know what I mean.
00:12:04 Sure.
00:12:05 Yes.
00:12:06 Sure.
00:12:07 So I didn't really have much to contribute, but I think part of the reason you got so much money from the patreon after you announced that is,
00:12:14 it kind of reminded me of how like Kiwi Farms only pays attention to you because like you're associated with Trixie,
00:12:22 which is kind of, kind of weird.
00:12:24 Right.
00:12:25 She's got a thread.
00:12:26 Yeah.
00:12:27 Because she's got a thread and so, she's got a thread and she doesn't like do anything anymore.
00:12:32 She's like almost completely retreated like from posting almost anywhere.
00:12:37 So they've like, there's like so starved for things to talk about that's like, they just, they talk about the PCP sometimes.
00:12:43 Yeah.
00:12:44 Because, because what else are they going to say?
00:12:47 They're going to talk about how Jews are going to kill all the white people.
00:12:52 In a different thread.
00:12:53 Yeah.
00:12:54 In a different thread.
00:12:55 That's the, does Ethan Ralph have his own thread?
00:12:58 He must.
00:12:59 Ethan, Ethan Ralph not only has his own thread, he's got his whole like subforum.
00:13:03 He's like the biggest fucking thing on there right now.
00:13:05 Oh, I didn't know that.
00:13:07 Yeah.
00:13:08 It's, I don't really get it.
00:13:09 But like, yeah, his thread got so big that they made, they made an entire subforum for like mini threat.
00:13:16 I don't know why he's so big.
00:13:19 He's just like some podcaster, but.
00:13:22 Well, he's a very large man.
00:13:25 So I guess he does.
00:13:26 I guess he is a pretty large.
00:13:28 They like, they like drama and I'm guessing Ethan has a lot of drama.
00:13:32 I don't know.
00:13:33 I mean, he was like, I guess there's drama guy.
00:13:36 And he's also like, so we're like a thousand other people.
00:13:39 I don't know.
00:13:40 I don't see.
00:13:41 I don't see what's so uniquely interesting about him, but you could say that about like
00:13:46 like everyone they obsess over.
00:13:48 Like I never even, I was never even like a big Chris Chan follower.
00:13:54 Hmm.
00:13:55 Right.
00:13:56 But I'm proud.
00:13:57 This is one of a kind.
00:13:58 Well, I'm a minority in that, obviously.
00:14:00 Hmm.
00:14:01 Hmm.
00:14:02 But anyway, I guess we can talk about the tails gets told now.
00:14:06 Yeah, I'm just curious, like, how did that, how did, how did getting it made go and how
00:14:12 has the response been?
00:14:14 Well, I think we talk link in the description, by the way, link in the description, Amazon
00:14:19 link to where you can buy the book.
00:14:21 Can you like it right now?
00:14:22 Actually, I haven't gotten around to buying one.
00:14:24 I'll do that right now.
00:14:25 Live.
00:14:26 I actually also have not bought one, but I am going to.
00:14:30 Yeah.
00:14:31 Give us the link.
00:14:32 Yeah.
00:14:33 It sold way more than I thought it would.
00:14:35 Oh, that's great.
00:14:36 Let me let me check.
00:14:37 Let me check how many right now.
00:14:39 Hold on.
00:14:41 It was, it was over a hundred last I checked.
00:14:44 That's pretty good.
00:14:45 Yeah.
00:14:46 That's pretty good.
00:14:47 And people have been like sending me pictures of their copy and stuff.
00:14:51 I saw one, I saw one person posting theirs.
00:14:55 That's, that's good shit.
00:14:57 Yeah.
00:14:58 That's good for the hype train.
00:15:00 Yeah.
00:15:01 And me and laser bought are getting the money, which is good because we both have like really
00:15:04 shitty jobs.
00:15:05 Yeah.
00:15:06 Yeah.
00:15:07 So we need it.
00:15:09 I mean, I mean the thing that the nice thing about that is that like, I mean, I imagine
00:15:15 it will have a bunch of sales right at the beginning, but it will like, it will continue
00:15:19 to be around and hopefully it will continue like people will continue to, to buy it and
00:15:25 like it will maybe continue to like, you know, generate some sales as going on.
00:15:31 Like it's not like, it's not like one and done, you know, it's like people in the future
00:15:36 can will be able to find it and be like, Oh yeah.
00:15:38 Yeah.
00:15:39 Now I've discovered tales get trolled.
00:15:40 Guess I should buy the book and buy the book.
00:15:42 Maybe.
00:15:43 Yeah.
00:15:44 And more, more volumes are coming out.
00:15:45 I don't know when, but laser bought already do the covers for them.
00:15:48 Yeah.
00:15:49 He, he, he, he's really excited.
00:15:50 Eleazar show the cover.
00:15:52 Eleazar show the cover of the first episode, the first volume on the, on the screen there.
00:15:59 Even though laser.
00:16:00 There it is.
00:16:01 Even though laser bought left tails gets told he was really excited about the physical
00:16:04 edition.
00:16:06 Cool.
00:16:07 Yeah.
00:16:08 You got that.
00:16:09 From what I remember from the interview, he seemed kind of a, he seemed pretty excited
00:16:13 about it.
00:16:14 Yeah.
00:16:15 Oh, I changed, I changed the title on the, I think it was in, in like after an episode
00:16:20 we were just talking and cyber shell said that he thought that the title of the episode
00:16:25 was kind of bad.
00:16:26 Like for getting clicks and also the thumbnail is kind of like, the thumbnail is really busy
00:16:31 and it's hard to read.
00:16:33 So I changed the title.
00:16:34 I think I called it like laser bought speaks, but I think I changed it to like interview
00:16:39 with tails gets trolled creator laser bought because, because more people will know what
00:16:43 that means.
00:16:44 Yeah.
00:16:45 I'm probably going to change the thumbnail to be like, it's like a crowd shot, but it's
00:16:48 kind of hard to tell what it is.
00:16:49 I'm probably just, I'm probably just going to put the fucking tails face on it.
00:16:52 You know, that's what people want.
00:16:54 Yeah.
00:16:55 People are crazy about that tails face.
00:16:56 That's what, that's what you said.
00:16:58 I mean, that's what you did for the first one where you talked about tails gets told coming
00:17:02 back.
00:17:03 I did.
00:17:04 And I was like, oh, I can't do it again.
00:17:07 But like, no, I can totally just do it again.
00:17:10 Well, you mean the first one was CC because that's the, no, the first one was a cyber
00:17:14 show.
00:17:15 Yeah.
00:17:16 Yeah.
00:17:17 I just use it again.
00:17:18 PCP fans will know.
00:17:19 Yeah.
00:17:20 Fuck it.
00:17:21 PCP.
00:17:22 PCP fans are the dumbest rubes.
00:17:24 They're the biggest suckers on the internet.
00:17:26 No name.
00:17:27 Watch.
00:17:28 Yeah.
00:17:29 Yeah.
00:17:30 Of course.
00:17:31 Yeah.
00:17:32 Yeah.
00:17:33 Yeah.
00:17:34 I like it, but I don't know if it really works as a, as a YouTube thumbnail.
00:17:37 And it's such a shame at low resolution.
00:17:40 Yeah.
00:17:41 Yeah.
00:17:42 Classic tails gets told are, you know, this is kind of tangentially related, but I, I
00:17:46 love the extra artworks that laser bot did for the comic that weren't like actual pages,
00:17:51 but they were like just stuff that was related to tails gets told that he drew.
00:17:56 Let me try to find an example.
00:17:58 There's a bunch of them like right here.
00:18:00 Are you, are you saying, are you saying that there's like, there's like exclusive bonus
00:18:04 content in the book?
00:18:06 Oh, not, not in the book.
00:18:07 It's on the website.
00:18:09 Oh, okay.
00:18:10 Okay.
00:18:11 Yeah.
00:18:12 Well, there is like one or there's like one or two bonuses in the book, but that's not
00:18:17 what I'm talking about here.
00:18:18 I'm talking about like these pictures like he drew, um, this one, this is one of my favorites.
00:18:25 Let me paste it in real quick.
00:18:30 The best challenge for a troll is troll another.
00:18:34 What the f...
00:18:37 It's a remember Kermit's backstory where he tells tales about him in the Muppets destroyed
00:18:45 each other by trolling each other.
00:18:48 I completely forgot about that, but thank you.
00:18:51 Now I, now I get it.
00:18:53 Now I understand what I'm looking at.
00:18:56 Yeah.
00:18:57 That's what the, uh, it was, they, they fell into a troll spiral.
00:19:02 Yeah.
00:19:03 A troll, a troll battle.
00:19:04 Never, never got out.
00:19:05 Never got out.
00:19:06 Many such cases.
00:19:08 Yeah.
00:19:09 Sad.
00:19:10 Oh, there it is.
00:19:12 There it is.
00:19:14 Uh, I'm glad to hear, I'm glad to hear that it's, uh, that's moving.
00:19:18 That's moving copies.
00:19:19 Oh yeah.
00:19:20 There is a, that's pretty good.
00:19:22 Um, 32 have been, uh, shipped so far.
00:19:25 Oh, that's almost 200.
00:19:26 So then more or less than the vapors.
00:19:30 Um, ooh, wait, uh, vapors, one Kickstarter.
00:19:36 How many pledges was that?
00:19:38 That was, first one was, fuckin' 212 backers, but not all of them, not all of them bought
00:19:50 Some of them were like five dollar backers second Vapors two was three hundred and twenty nine
00:19:56 But I mean the price the price point of that was fifteen dollars
00:19:59 Whereas this is like what twenty twenty six dollars twenty nine dollars. Yeah, then twenty nine
00:20:04 So you so you know you you got a you got a you got to account for that
00:20:09 You got to account for for for total volume you got to multiply the rate at which money
00:20:14 They've exchanged his hands to do the total the total size of the economy
00:20:18 You know that's that's DOS capital right there. It's a velocity
00:20:23 It's all about that money velocity and soon money will be worthless. So you might as well spend it right now
00:20:28 Oh, I saw a great video from the Gravel Institute about how Bitcoin is a scam
00:20:33 Oh, I was I was gravel like Mike Gravel. I believe it's I believe it's pronounced Gravel
00:20:39 Yeah, it is. I think he's Mike Mike Gravel. Yeah, it is Gravel, but gravel sounds cooler and
00:20:44 He also knew a kid. I knew a kid in my like elementary school
00:20:48 I went to school through high school with a kid who was named Mike Gravel
00:20:52 Not not Gravel but Gravel
00:20:55 Wow, he's a he's
00:20:59 He's obsolete. Well, that's a politician. Isn't that we're like, yeah, Mike Mike Gravel was the Mike Gravel was a
00:21:06 I think he was a senator from Alaska
00:21:08 Yeah, he was like he was extremely base. Sorry if that sounds like Bernie brochure
00:21:12 But yeah, he was extremely, but he like just died like this year. Oh, yeah
00:21:19 That's right
00:21:19 I was gonna mention Mike Gravel or Mike Gravel also sounds better for him because he made that um
00:21:25 He made that ad where he like throws a rock in the water. I
00:21:30 Haven't seen that one. Oh that one is so fucking good. Let me try to find it
00:21:37 That's that haven't it just seems like he such a
00:21:43 Such a what Alaskan ad. I don't know something about I think this is it. This is one ad. Oh
00:21:51 Throw it Mike Gravel. Mike Gravel rock
00:21:54 I'm sure I'm I can't find the oh here we go. I found it. Okay. What is that? What is the point?
00:22:00 He's just staring at the camera. Yeah
00:22:03 What is the point? I don't know
00:22:06 It's a
00:22:08 It's a avant-garde it's postmodern shit post it sure is I'm gonna go back. Yeah, but I go for him
00:22:15 But he was like he was like the um the most left
00:22:20 Presidential candidate in 2008
00:22:23 Yeah, he he he ran as um
00:22:27 The thing they say always he ran as a gadfly to just like
00:22:31 Be there to like put pressure on the other like centrist candidates to be like, hey, how come you suck on all these issues?
00:22:38 Yeah, how come you how come you're bad and you don't want to do good things. Yeah, and of course, of course
00:22:43 I never heard of him two years later
00:22:46 Yeah
00:22:47 The media he really did it again in in 20s in 2020 20, right? He was there for a bit
00:22:52 Yeah, but he didn't he didn't get into any of the debates
00:22:56 Like like he did with the first time didn't he get in the one I think I think he was in no
00:23:02 I'm pretty sure he was in like one of the early dem dem primary only only in 2008
00:23:09 No, I remember like in 2020. I followed that very closely
00:23:14 Unfortunately, maybe wait, maybe I am thinking of old clips that I just saw this year or last year. Yeah, yeah
00:23:21 He was shedding he shouldn't he shed on Biden in that one too because Biden ran for president 2008
00:23:27 But Obama and Hillary were also there. Oh
00:23:30 Yeah, yeah, I think I'm thinking of like he was he was gonna run this year
00:23:35 But like you could because like they changed the debate rules and like he was one of the people that like didn't get to like
00:23:41 Be on stage or whatever. Yeah, boo
00:23:45 But yeah, the Grevelling since you just put out a video about how Bitcoin is a scam and that just reminds me I
00:23:51 sold I sold my Bitcoin
00:23:54 Like a like like a week or two ago and I was thinking like and then it went up a bunch and I was like damn
00:24:00 I missed out
00:24:01 I could have made I could have made a little bit of money and then like a week ago
00:24:04 The like the president of El Salvador declares Bitcoin like an official currency of El Salvador
00:24:10 He buys like 500 Bitcoin and then and for some reason that makes the price tank by like 15%
00:24:18 And and now it's down. I mean, it's it's up a little bit from there, but it's still down from where I bought it
00:24:24 So I guess I won
00:24:26 I guess I won in the end. Yeah, unless it goes to a hundred and then I'll lose
00:24:30 It's kind of a scam, but it's also like mostly just like gambling
00:24:35 It's it's both. It's both. Yeah, it's both of those things. Scambling. You will scam scambling
00:24:41 Well, I know it's a scam. Well, but it's but some people can make money on it
00:24:46 Oh, yeah, Crip as so crypto mining and stupid motherfucker bullshit, whatever
00:24:52 Yeah, it's um
00:24:54 You know, it's basically a Ponzi scheme where like a few a few people get rich early on and then everyone is like
00:24:59 Oh, I can get rich doing this and then they all jump in and then they're they're the ones that are left
00:25:04 Holding the bag as they say when it never actually goes anywhere. Yeah
00:25:10 That's that's how they try to get you. That's how they try to
00:25:14 Mm-hmm, and they do and it works sometimes. Yeah
00:25:19 Oh
00:25:22 You know, I was probably thinking of oh
00:25:24 You're gonna love this. I was thinking of fucking Tom Steyer. I was thinking of Tom Steyer and it's Steyer buyers. I'm a Steyer buyer
00:25:32 Yeah, the billionaire guy. I think I was thinking of him not Mike gravel
00:25:36 That I think was what they were trying to raise money. So Mike gravel could be in a yes
00:25:42 In a yeah, and that's why they had all the they had all these weird like they had all these viral tweets
00:25:47 Cuz his campaign was being run by a bunch of like
00:25:51 Yes, yeah, that was it and I think the zoomers helped found the Gravel Institute also
00:25:59 Yeah, yeah, I saw them like in an interview or something about it. They just like
00:26:04 It's Gravel Institute is awesome. It's so cool. I wish it were bigger
00:26:09 But I mean, you know, it'll maybe you'll get there one of their one of their videos with them
00:26:15 Where they talk about how America's shit that got over a million views, but that's I think that's the only that's the only one that
00:26:22 Got a lot of traction. I I have more views than the than the Gravel
00:26:26 I mean, they've got like 300k subscribers, which is like a fairly new channel. I mean, they're still growing. I hope
00:26:32 You know, they want to be like the leftist answer to the Prager you which you know is it is a tall order
00:26:38 But you know, they're they're they're making progress
00:26:41 Top that channel even yeah, sure
00:26:44 Can I say something really quick? And I'm sorry if this sounds like a bunch of like liberal cock bullshit
00:26:49 But okay, like even like ignoring like political views like I don't understand how anyone can take Prager you seriously
00:26:57 like
00:26:59 It's just it's it's literally it's literally just that like people
00:27:04 They people that already agree with them just like like like to hear it repeated
00:27:09 It doesn't it doesn't matter if the charts don't make any sense or that the experts are all like have like fake degrees and whatever
00:27:15 It's like it's it's that's that's irrelevant
00:27:18 And also it's just Prager or people say people say thing I agree with
00:27:23 Dennis Dennis Prager is also like a old-ass
00:27:28 like
00:27:29 Conserve oil Baron or something. No, he's like an old-ass. Well, he's funded by old oil Barons
00:27:35 But he's like an old-ass
00:27:37 conservative talk old-ass conservative talk radio guy from like the like the 90s and
00:27:43 It's like he just has all the partisan Republican
00:27:46 Like
00:27:48 Opinions like I don't know. It's just stupid
00:27:51 This this town is run by
00:27:53 Spendocrat Diamond Joe Quimby and all his hippie friends who would rather would rather play hecky sack
00:28:01 Lock up the homeless. That's another funny thing like oh Joe Biden is a fucking communist like oh, okay
00:28:08 Well, he is yeah, he's he's he's forcing vaccine mandates. He's gonna force feminizes
00:28:14 Any anything to the left of Ronald Reagan is a communist
00:28:19 Yeah, even Reagan cow pushing it. Yeah, even Reagan was a little bit
00:28:25 Yeah, he wanted to give I'm trying to give it. He wanted to give amnesty to illegal immigrants
00:28:30 That's like some fucking open borders communist shit. That's pushing it. Yeah
00:28:37 Obama also said he was like a
00:28:40 Ronald Reagan, which I agree with and of course Obama was a socialist that makes Ronald Reagan a socialist, you know, I
00:28:47 Guess I guess that yeah sound logic. I can't argue with it
00:28:53 So for a while, I thought I thought Dennis Prager was dead. Is he not dead? I
00:28:59 Think I wish
00:29:01 No, I think his brother died or something or no, there was um, they know who were like the fracking coke brothers
00:29:07 The coke brothers one of the yeah, one of the one of the coke brothers died
00:29:10 And I think I was confused for a while that like
00:29:13 The Prager that like Prager was one of the coke brothers, but he's not
00:29:18 I mean his middle name is it's his full name Dennis coke Prager. I can understand you might be confused
00:29:24 Wait, is that true?
00:29:26 Okay, it's one of those one of those lies I tell it's like
00:29:30 Patented tectonic improv
00:29:32 It's like how in the Super Mario Brothers movie their names were Mario Mario and Luigi Mario
00:29:38 Right Dennis Prager Luigi Prager Dennis
00:29:41 Coke Coke and Pepsi Prager Dennis Dennis Coke Prager and
00:29:47 whatever the
00:29:48 Coke brothers names were I forgot?
00:29:51 Did you know that did you know that the coke brothers ran as libertarians in the 80s? I thought that was interesting
00:29:59 That sounds about right. Yeah, I can't say that shocks me too much
00:30:04 But I don't even know anything about those. I don't know what they look like or whatever. I just know that they're bad
00:30:10 Yeah, bad and I don't like P one of them is dead and that's and that's funny people always said that um
00:30:18 The coke brothers are like the leftist boo boogeyman kind of like George source source is like a boogeyman for good service
00:30:24 But like I was I was looking the other day and I heard that um George source was really concerned about the profits of black rock
00:30:32 You know that company that was like buying like real estate and shit. I
00:30:37 Don't know if you
00:30:39 He sounds familiar sounds familiar. Yeah, and like if he's if he is black rock not like a private military contractor
00:30:46 No, that's black water. Oh
00:30:48 Okay, okay
00:30:51 PMC black rock is like a real estate and they're like responsible for like driving up like real estate prices and shit and
00:30:58 Apparently George George source was like really concerned about their profits, and I'm like that doesn't really sound like a leftist
00:31:05 But you know, well, he's a billionaire after I mean all has been said and done. Yeah
00:31:11 Exactly I'm saying what they say. Yeah, he's also Jewish. So I mean every I mean I
00:31:17 Mean everyone who makes everyone who has a lot of money is really concerned with who else is making a lot of money
00:31:23 I know it seems it seems all how is it even relevant? It seems obvious to me
00:31:28 But all the conservators of like oh George source is trying to he's trying to make us all like
00:31:34 Cucks and shit. I don't know
00:31:37 Sure. Well, obviously
00:31:39 That's what I would do if I was probably probably cuz he's so he's probably just socially liberal and
00:31:45 That that's what that's the only thing they care about because of it's a stupid culture. Well shit
00:31:50 I really hate politics. I'm gonna stop talking about it. The socially liberal financially conservative person
00:31:56 I was thinking about that term the other day and how I'd never hear I always hear I hear that a lot
00:32:01 I never hear the the financially liberal socially conservative. What would that look like?
00:32:08 Yeah, I
00:32:11 Nobody does it if that would be if that would be if you're like
00:32:14 If you're just like believing like traditional values, you know, you know who that would be that would be like Caleb Moppin. I
00:32:21 Don't know who that is
00:32:23 If he's like a he's sort of like a tanky guy. He's like a he's like a communist. He's fucking on Twitter
00:32:32 Did you look him up?
00:32:37 He's like a he's like a communist, but he's all
00:32:40 Him and like Peter Coffin are sort of friends and they are they have this stick going where they're like
00:32:45 They're appealing to like traditional American values the like the the the the what he called the new the nuclear family
00:32:52 you know
00:32:55 You know, they're doing this like appeal to like traditional values and their argument is like, yeah
00:33:01 Capitalism has like, you know has eroded our values
00:33:04 Capitalism is what has destroyed our culture, you know, which are returned to traditional values is possible, you know
00:33:09 Through to it through the adoption of socialism, right? I like I think that's what it looks like to be socially conservative and and
00:33:17 Ufiscally liberal. That's that's a unique people. That's a unique perspective because most people who are like pro capitalism are like dumbass boomers who just
00:33:26 Like had Cold War propaganda when they were like five years old. So they're all like, oh communist communism is evil
00:33:33 And I mean to know the to be fair a calming like
00:33:37 USSR and China and shit is like stupid. I don't like tank. He's either but yeah
00:33:43 This guy is so funny. He wrote like a bunch of a
00:33:48 Bunch of like a punch a bunch of people who one might consider bread tubers like all
00:33:54 Made fun of him. So he wrote he wrote it
00:33:57 So he wrote a whole book called bread tube serves imperialism
00:34:01 And he and he published it and it's basically just a rundown of like people in bread tube
00:34:07 Who he doesn't like and like why they suck?
00:34:11 Yeah
00:34:14 He wanted he wrote there were a couple bits he wrote that like Vosh has many skeletons in his closet including a lack of charisma
00:34:23 Um
00:34:24 He implied that thought slime has probably led trans kids to suicide by like having them like question their gender too much or something
00:34:34 Yeah, it's pretty bad. That's weird. That's weird that you like
00:34:39 Yeah, I spend time writing a book publishing it about you do internet people. He doesn't like
00:34:46 This is all in line with like the whole when Peter Coffin had their like public freak out and like banned everyone that they considered
00:34:53 To be bread to be including like Jenny Nicholson
00:34:55 This is like just totally a political people
00:34:58 Has Jenny Nicholson ever said anything about politics?
00:35:02 No, she's she's she's occasionally alluded to like some maybe vaguely culturally progressive things
00:35:08 But she's not like political, you know, I think she she thinks that like racism is bad
00:35:14 You know like if that's if that's that sounds like some global homo Jewish shit
00:35:20 True true true
00:35:24 Um, anyway, oh
00:35:26 Speaking of which did you hear about the controversy? Well, it's not really controversy except for 4chan dumbasses
00:35:34 The game no more heroes 3. There's a you can get a sweatshirt that says fuck fuck racism
00:35:40 Yes, and no people on 4chan got really we can't have that shit
00:35:45 Yeah, we can't have that shit in a video game, you know cuz really cuz really it says fuck racism
00:35:52 Yeah, okay, and you know
00:35:54 anti-racism is the code word for anti-white
00:35:57 This this is I see this is um, this is just like when when the quartering was like
00:36:03 What did he someone said like fuck Hitler?
00:36:07 He was like hey, and the good you want to know the quarter was like. Oh, it was like some it was Michael Chiquino
00:36:14 You're shitting. I'm not joking. It was Michael. You're shitting me. I'm not joking. He's here. I'm not joking
00:36:20 I don't know who that is. It's that's the guy who did the Maui Mallard. It's Maui Mallard guy. Oh my god
00:36:27 That can't be true. Oh my god, 100% true 100% true
00:36:30 Holy fun the tweet shit find the tweet
00:36:33 Yeah, when someone was like Hitler was bad and and the quartering was like, oh really this is there and this now
00:36:41 Yeah, there we have it. I mean to play devil's advocate. This is this is the Chiquino cast
00:36:47 This is the Chiquino cast. I mean to play to play devil's advocate. Maybe
00:36:53 quartering meant why no, he didn't really mean this but
00:36:56 Maybe yikes, maybe he meant like oh you're saying Hitler is bad
00:37:00 Well, obviously like Hitler is bad. You're just virtual signaling or something
00:37:05 But I was a big fan of his music, but I yikes didn't realize he wasn't he didn't like Hitler. Sorry about that everyone
00:37:12 No, I know I know I know what he means. I know he's like
00:37:17 This is just virtue signaling, but like that's fucking stupid all on its own, right? Yeah, that's an it's an idiot opinion for idiots
00:37:24 Yeah, sure Michael Chiquino's Jewish also also if uh if Michael said like fuck Stalin or something the quartering would be like
00:37:31 Oh my god, based a hundred Gorillian dead
00:37:34 it
00:37:36 true the
00:37:37 It's that that meme of the the soy face that is like
00:37:41 place
00:37:43 Unimpressed place Japan soy face. Oh
00:37:46 You know, yeah that one he gets excited. Yeah, it would be that meme
00:37:51 Oh, never mind. Hey guys. I got a great idea. Oh, by the way, let's draw the quartering as a soy face
00:37:56 Let's draw him as soy by the way that I'll show that place. Japan meme is unironically me
00:38:02 I'm not a shame to admit it
00:38:06 Yeah, yeah, that's why it came in yeah it is
00:38:10 True this there was a nugget of truth in there and it spoke to people
00:38:14 They saw themselves in it like a mirror. Yeah
00:38:18 That's why I resonate. Is that how you is that how you say this name Chiquino Chiquino. Yeah, ju-ju-ju-ju-quino
00:38:25 I guess that makes sense. Yeah, I'm I'm pretty sure that's how you say it
00:38:29 I remember looking it up. Is he is he really Jewish because that sounds Italian or something? No, he's not he's not Jewish
00:38:35 He's telling okay. I was gonna say I mean, I guess I guess you could be both. Yeah
00:38:40 There are there are black Jews and
00:38:44 European Jews and I know that there are black Jews because I've seen because I've seen the the rabbi's cat and
00:38:52 And I know all that move that in it in that movie
00:38:55 They go to they travel into the deepest part of Africa to find the share home of the shared
00:39:01 Homeland of all blacks and Jews and the people that live there are like 12 feet tall and they're like so dark that they're like blue
00:39:09 And there's these judge these these black giants that just have you know, what's the word a bar mitzvahs and stuff and
00:39:17 The cat tries to get bar mitzvah to become a
00:39:20 Real boy, but they won't do it
00:39:23 Because the talking cat is is is some witchcraft or something
00:39:28 Are you talking about are you talking about an avatar because you mentioned like tall blue people
00:39:33 No, I'm talking about the rabbi's cat. It's like a Belgian movie
00:39:37 Is it like live I think live action
00:39:40 No, it's animated. Yeah, I think I think YMS recommended it in one of his like like best of some year
00:39:46 Ronda, I think then talked about on the body only the only it has like a weird. I probably did
00:39:52 Huh, doesn't it have like a really weird ending? Yeah, it's what I just said they go to the shared
00:39:57 Homeland of all blacks and Jews and they find they get chased out by these giants who are like no no fucking no fucking foreigners allowed get out
00:40:05 Yeah, I always imagine this looked like the thief in the collar, but I actually don't know a little bit
00:40:11 Kind of rest
00:40:14 Rest in peace. It has that it has that it has that Lynn Claire like sort of tin tin. Yeah, like a
00:40:21 sort of
00:40:23 What's that like a Le Lascar kind of like French? Oh my god look about it. I never knew this is from 2012
00:40:29 I thought this was like from the 80s
00:40:32 Hmm
00:40:34 No, it's I mean it if it was one of YMS's yearly picks so it couldn't have been that yeah
00:40:41 Yeah, he's only done those as far back as like 2007. Okay. Yeah, I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad people are still making true art in the
00:40:49 in the medium of animation I
00:40:52 Wish I was something once in a while. I wish animation was more respected
00:40:58 I
00:41:01 Think it's a little too respected. Yeah, I think I think the pendulum has swung too hard in the other direction
00:41:08 Yeah, well depending on the
00:41:12 Depending on the target I'm kind of a centrist about animation
00:41:15 I'm kind of a centrist about animation
00:41:16 I kind of think both sides are bad the people that think it's a valid art form and the people that think it don't I think we should compromise
00:41:22 Yeah, you're right
00:41:24 You've yeah, you've convinced me
00:41:27 True
00:41:30 What were we talking about tails get strolled the Mike Jews Mike Shiano being Jewish, okay
00:41:39 What did I say Geano, I think Mike Geano sure
00:41:45 What's so what else is up I should have I
00:41:51 No, I would have talked last time about how I moved into my new apartment and how it sucks and my landlies sucks
00:41:56 And I hate this fucking place and I've been ripped off. I've been fucking I've been fucking scammed
00:42:01 Oh, no for this place. It's dog shit. Yeah, it's fucking dog shit first months rent and last month's rent and a full month's security
00:42:08 Rent security deposit and a $200 like application fee just to get in here and the place is fucking dog shit
00:42:15 Yeah kitchen is foul
00:42:17 Kitchen is gross. There's the cabinet just has like a boiler in it
00:42:21 The cabinet is just a boiler. They can't even put shit in there
00:42:25 Floor is dirty crack paints peeling windows are fucking shit
00:42:29 There's like iron bars over my windows that I had to get like them the product that the property manager to take off
00:42:36 So that I could put my my air conditioner in the window
00:42:40 Oh, I guess I'm not gonna need that for much longer because it's September now. It's fine
00:42:43 Conditioner out today fucking
00:42:47 Rats in the parking lot. I hear I hear rats squeaking out in the parking lot right out my window all the time
00:42:52 I mean, I guess that's not the worst thing, but it's just emblematic. It's just emblematic of the kind
00:42:57 I usually have a location. Oh, sorry the location amazing the location amazing everything else about the place dog shit
00:43:04 Maybe and I'm maybe yearly and large to get a real job
00:43:07 I
00:43:11 Want to fucking I want to say hey, I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna like hey give me my fight
00:43:17 I'll never get my security deposit back. I'm down like a fat
00:43:21 I've down like a thousand dollars because I'm definitely losing that security deposit
00:43:25 And I'm definitely losing that and that $200 that fucking it was just desperate
00:43:30 It was because I left my house hundreds for the last minute and I was desperate and I was like well
00:43:33 I need something so I took the deal. I was like fine $200 the application fee
00:43:38 I guess I got to pay it here. You go and now I've paid it and it's all gone and
00:43:43 And what I'm when what do I have left?
00:43:45 nothing
00:43:47 I'm ruined
00:43:49 I'm truly sorry. Yeah, I
00:43:52 Hate it. I hate it. Are you living but I mean
00:43:57 Well, I mean it's a unit with other rooms that other people live in okay
00:44:01 So I mean technically no, but like I don't I don't like interact with them that much. Yeah
00:44:06 Yeah, so, you know, I got my own room. I usually I usually have cats in my
00:44:12 Parking lot rather than rats. Oh
00:44:15 I would try I'd like to trade please and it's like it doesn't even matter where I lived
00:44:20 I lived in both California and Arizona and there was always cats in the
00:44:24 parking lot for some reason
00:44:27 No, just just rats just rats
00:44:31 Yeah, maybe you can give then one of the cats and leave it outside and the rat problem
00:44:36 Yeah, kind of take care of itself. All we need is one cat and it'll catch two mice and then it will multiply into two cats
00:44:44 Yeah, and then
00:44:46 That's that's how ecology works. Yeah
00:44:49 Uh
00:44:52 Fucking some fucking like frat house like right across right across the parking lot behind me
00:44:58 They're they're blast in there. They're blast in their tunes
00:45:01 Oh, you not even just on week not even just on weekends. Just whenever they feel like you should go and hang you should go and hang out with them. I
00:45:09 They'll never they'd never accept me. I'm too square. Yeah, I
00:45:14 Am much too square for that. I feel like I can't relate to the zoomers
00:45:20 They weren't even alive. They weren't even alive when 9-11 happened. Oh, by the way, happy 9-11
00:45:25 Happy 9-11. Yeah as of yesterday. Yeah, the last episode was late because we wanted to delay to release on 9-11
00:45:33 by the way to commemorate and we like brave
00:45:37 Mujahideen fighters
00:45:40 I didn't say that
00:45:42 We could get into a whole thing about 9-11. I have so many thoughts about it
00:45:46 Um
00:45:47 About I'm not gonna I'm not I'm not gonna go into it. I'll just go into the short version, which is
00:45:52 You know, everything has gotten worse since then
00:45:56 And uh, the world is going to shit and we're all gonna be fucked
00:46:01 That's all I'm gonna say about it
00:46:04 Sure
00:46:06 Thank you
00:46:09 What was I talking about um my fucking all these fucking kids these fucking kids in my in my parking lot with their rap music
00:46:17 And they're and they're and do a dance in the cha-cha or whatever sick. There should be a law against it
00:46:23 Uh, you need to show you need to show fans of rap music real music like anime openings
00:46:29 Yeah, video game music. Yeah, they have these. Yeah, they have these like giant parties and they're in their fenced off backyard
00:46:35 It sounds like there's like a hundred people back there just like yelling
00:46:38 Don't knock knock. Excuse me neighbors. I couldn't help but notice you were listening to uh some quite deplorable tunes
00:46:44 Perhaps you'd like to listen to the delta room chapter one soundtrack
00:46:50 I wonder I wonder if I went over there and I was just like, hey, let me come in
00:46:54 I wonder if they'd be like, okay, or if they'd be like, no, or if it'd be like, yeah pay like $15 you can come in
00:47:00 Describe like a six pack and then fill you in. Yeah, maybe you know, I don't know
00:47:05 There was a back before covid um
00:47:08 Someone in my work parking lot after work was blasting um megalovania from their car
00:47:15 Oh, I played I was playing I was playing dance not actually dance sense revolution, but a knockoff dance sense revolution
00:47:22 I went to cracks house
00:47:23 Yesterday and we played dance dance revolution
00:47:27 And he had a pack that had megalovania in it, but we didn't play it. I didn't play because it was too embarrassing
00:47:33 It might have been step mania. I don't even remember it's funny
00:47:36 I went to I went to a store yesterday and they actually had one of those like metal ddr mats for sale
00:47:41 Like I think it was like a hundred bucks or something. It was used
00:47:45 I was like pretty good. I don't know who brought that in and you know, that would be cool and all
00:47:50 But I I don't have the room for that and I don't play the game
00:47:53 So I just ignored it crack just had crack had the soft pad
00:47:56 But he had it like he had it like screwed into like a piece of plywood
00:48:00 And then he he had like holds in his floor for screwing the plywood to the floor like bolt it down
00:48:05 He sounds like a really dedicated ddr fan
00:48:08 And yet he rolled by one of those metal mats with the with the handle that you hold on to
00:48:16 Yeah, I guess why not why not just go all the way?
00:48:18 He's a little DIY. I guess they're heavy. You might as well buy a whole ass arcade machine
00:48:23 If you're gonna go that far
00:48:26 Yeah, true
00:48:27 No, I went to his uh, I went to the house that he's been uh renovating and posting the twitter thread about place is crazy
00:48:34 Place is awesome. The house rules. He had we had him on a few weeks ago to talk about home ownership
00:48:40 Crack's house is fucking sick. It's like one of the coolest houses. I've ever been in. I've seen the pictures
00:48:46 Crack is uh
00:48:47 So if you don't know crack if you don't know crack then
00:48:51 dev of uh endless war
00:48:53 Yes, yes
00:48:56 and friend of friend of the show and and the
00:48:59 Basically the guy who made endless war
00:49:01 Originally, yeah, he's cool. Cool guy. Yeah. Yeah, this house seems pretty cool apart from the leaky roof
00:49:06 Does he wasn't leaking when I was there? Does he does he actually own the house?
00:49:12 Yeah, he likes well, he's got him. Well, he's got a mortgage. He's got a mortgage, but yeah, he he he owns it
00:49:18 Yeah, in that sort of way
00:49:20 He's got uh, he's got like he works for like microsoft or some shit
00:49:24 He does he does. I I sort of work for microsoft
00:49:28 I work for a company that contracts with microsoft
00:49:32 Hmm
00:49:34 Do you do software stuff? Yeah
00:49:37 Hmm, okay
00:49:38 quality assurance
00:49:41 Yeah, I think I think I've known I think I've known at least one other person who did who had quality assurance with some
00:49:48 Some software company
00:49:50 Yeah, what a what a
00:49:53 What a what a fields
00:49:55 Um, you know, what's weird? I was talking about this
00:49:59 Uh, munchy another
00:50:02 Former member friend of the show. I'm sorry. Who's that? I I I remember him from the uh
00:50:07 Tgt lecture. Sure. What would you would you say tech? Who's that?
00:50:11 Who's that? Nobody. Nobody nobody at all. Uh, but he's doing he's doing um
00:50:18 He was doing art school. He was going to art school, but he's shifted gears and he's doing a computer science this year
00:50:25 He switched schools switched majors and now he's doing computer science
00:50:29 That's crazy
00:50:30 Kind of surprising
00:50:32 Good luck to him. Yeah, good luck to him. Yeah, I heard he I heard he left the internet to focus on that
00:50:39 He left the internet something else and as and as we all know you can't you can't go to school and be on the internet
00:50:44 Well, he he left the fandom of the internet and uh, yeah, who knows who knows if uh, if the fandom the internet will ever go back, you know
00:50:54 He he would have to he would have to beg forgiveness at this point. He would have to grovel
00:51:01 You know, you have to mic grovel
00:51:03 And it it might be harder nowadays, but I've actually known people who have left the internet
00:51:08 It might be yeah, it might be harder. Like I said these days
00:51:12 Go off the grid. I mean, I guess you can do it
00:51:16 I guess you you can it's probably easier if you just never uh join the internet to begin with like, uh
00:51:22 Like bill water. Yeah, you have to whatever
00:51:24 You have to go through the initiation process to join the internet
00:51:29 Uh, I mean the internet is like it's where you get fucking it's where information is. I don't know. I mean
00:51:37 You you if you if you're okay with just being like completely disconnected with from society then sure you can do it anything you want
00:51:44 You can just completely unplug and not read newspapers and not talk to anyone and then sure. Yeah
00:51:49 No problem, but like
00:51:51 Sucks. I don't know who wants to do that. I love I love when the internet was like first coming out or whatever
00:51:58 um
00:51:59 They
00:52:00 Had all those like videos explaining it that were like really corny and they called it like the information super highway and shit like that
00:52:08 I love the information super highway. That's such a good name and remember remember when commercials had aol keywords in them
00:52:15 I remember um, yeah, I was never clear on what those did
00:52:19 me neither
00:52:20 But they they would they would say the url and they would also say the aol keyword. I'm like, what the fuck is that?
00:52:26 I remember the no nobody even knows what aol is anymore for like Netscape and net zero
00:52:31 But this wasn't like when they were brand new
00:52:33 This was when they were trying to rebrand and be cool
00:52:36 Because you know, I'm I was born in 97. So I don't have I don't I don't know a lot of 90 shit
00:52:41 I know like early 2000s crap. I remember
00:52:44 Like I just like one of these ads for I think it was net zero where there's like a bunch of these cool
00:52:49 yuppies just hanging out on their uh in their new york apartment
00:52:54 Like uh and like a skyscraper just talking about how fucking sick net zero is and how they're like drinking champagne
00:53:00 It's like you need to be a part of this
00:53:02 and uh
00:53:07 Yeah, you know, what's really sad
00:53:10 What's that?
00:53:11 I don't even think like when like I used to think of people born in like the late 90s as little kids
00:53:16 But I don't even think that anymore in 24 because we've already we've already got the generation alpha generation alpha is already being born
00:53:24 Yeah, exactly, but also because most
00:53:27 Most people online that I come across are like born in like 2002 and like that's really like little kid shit. Yeah
00:53:35 is that like in the in
00:53:38 I mean like I mean, I guess probably most of the people that I see on twitter are like, you know
00:53:42 They're people that follow the pcp. So maybe they're probably like mid
00:53:47 Mid 20s at the oldest to down to like, you know late teens
00:53:51 At the youngest mostly wasn't there someone who called a few weeks ago that was like 14
00:53:57 Yeah, yeah, I was talking to I was talking to kazzie about it and they were like they were like
00:54:04 14 or something when they started watching like uh, uh, the the horse the horse cast or whatever
00:54:10 Oh, that's weird. So they're
00:54:12 Yeah, at least at least maybe 16. I don't know at least they were in the target audience for my little pony
00:54:19 The target demographic. Yeah, I guess so well
00:54:21 Even even like 14 to 16 would be a little too old
00:54:25 But I mean, of course, there's the whole brony thing. So
00:54:29 That's like an exception
00:54:31 One time uh
00:54:33 The only my little pony I know about is like the one my sister watched when she was a kid
00:54:37 I like the eight from like the 80s. So I said the
00:54:41 Oh, sorry go ahead. No, no, I you can finish. I have an unrelated point
00:54:46 Oh, so, um one time in your discord. I said the original my little pony is better than friendship is magic and it was really controversial
00:54:55 um, okay, I got a comment on my
00:55:00 uh, the the the
00:55:02 It was one of the two lectures the other day the the the chris chan lectures and someone was like, uh, you said that chris wasn't into
00:55:12 Uh, uh, my little pony and that chris got into my little pony late
00:55:16 But actually chris was drawing my little pony even back in the pre sonichu era in the pre timeskik era
00:55:22 Because megan, you know, I actually remember that I actually remember that I wrote okay
00:55:27 I remember it too
00:55:28 But I hate this person because they're deliberately misunderstanding me because I was specifically talking about the brony fandom
00:55:34 Which is not pre gen four mlp old mlp fans are not bronies
00:55:39 It's a gen four fandom is the and chris was like really late to get into brony
00:55:44 Yes, she liked the old my little pony for a bit because megan liked it, but that doesn't count
00:55:48 That wasn't what I was talking about. I was furious. I'm gonna be furious of this individual
00:55:52 I'm gonna side with you on this one because I get a lot of comments that are uh
00:55:57 Where people will people will say things that I obviously know about if you've seen the video
00:56:02 Maybe I don't say them outright
00:56:04 But just like the way I talk about something should at least imply that yes, I know don't worry ever
00:56:11 I know
00:56:12 Yeah, you don't have to tell me I know the first the first sonichu lecture
00:56:16 The thing that everyone wanted to correct me on was that I said chris worked at burger king when in fact
00:56:21 Everyone knows everybody knows she worked at wendy's and she got fired from wendy's
00:56:25 For doing a donald duck impression
00:56:28 Yeah, well, that's funny. That's pretty that's pretty awesome
00:56:32 Everyone comments to tell me i'm wrong about that and fair enough
00:56:34 So I corrected that one in the first the first few minutes of this of the second one
00:56:38 But then in this one the one that I got wrong that everyone tells me is that I was not aware
00:56:43 That the reason chris threw that chapter about rosa chu getting fat was because like some girl that chris was talking to
00:56:49 Had like a fat fetish and so she wrote this like this fat
00:56:53 Plotline in to like please that girlfriend
00:56:56 I I I had heard about that, but I had completely forgotten about it. So like that one's true
00:57:01 That's like, yeah fair criticism. I didn't mention that one
00:57:05 But other than that other than that, I think I was pretty good and I definitely
00:57:10 Was not wrong about the brony thing
00:57:12 She was not drawing. She was not like drawing pony stuff until like
00:57:17 After the peak
00:57:18 Until after t-bap was already over
00:57:21 What's t-bap?
00:57:34 How does one explain how does one even begin to explain t-bap?
00:57:39 Uh fencing and best guy ever used to have a pony show where they reviewed uh episodes of my little pony together among other things
00:57:48 t-bap
00:57:49 t-bap is more to the point t-bap
00:57:52 Half of t-bap is the protagonist of the up-and-coming video game masterpiece
00:57:59 uh phantoms revenge
00:58:01 Now now ben is uh, is phantoms revenge being done with zero crunch by its uh, its employees working on it?
00:58:07 I it is it is doing done with 100% crunch
00:58:11 What I am only crunching
00:58:13 Uh, uh, uh, man, I was uh, I picked out music
00:58:18 I picked out I picked out music for the game. I'm stealing music from front mission
00:58:23 Front mission gun hazard. I'm going with the soundtrack to that because it has like a sci-fi
00:58:27 I think it's pretty cool sort of aesthetic too. That's I never is that is that the one for for snes or
00:58:33 Yes, was it one of the later ones? I played no, it's it's an snes one
00:58:37 I played front mission three on the playstation when I was young. Uh, I'd never played the front mission gun hazard
00:58:43 It was on this nest
00:58:45 It could play for the gun hazard like a little bit on an emulator
00:58:49 The first few didn't come out in the us from what I remember. Yeah. Yeah
00:58:54 I mean, it's not a game that I like hear anyone talk about so I'm kind of like
00:58:58 Oh, people aren't even going to recognize these these these tracks. Is it um, you know, is it is front mission gun hazard?
00:59:04 It's like a side scrolling game
00:59:05 You're like you control a mech and you can like level up its stats and stuff to to be honest
00:59:10 I don't even know what kind of game it is. I haven't seen any gameplay front mission three is a like
00:59:14 Tactical rpg like a grid-based tactics game. Yeah, I think I played this most
00:59:19 Yeah, most of most of the ones in the series are like that
00:59:23 Yeah, which was my favorite kind of game when I was in like high school
00:59:27 I played like every single one like get my hands on like find
00:59:31 Final fantasy tactics
00:59:33 Like final fantasy tactics of van van van garden
00:59:37 Was it me vandal hearts? No vandal hearts is the one I'm thinking of uh, uh
00:59:42 Oh van van and vanguard bandits another one about piloting a mech. Um, the tactics ogre
00:59:51 Let us clean together
00:59:54 Huh tactics ogre let us clean together. I think that's what the subtitle is for that one
01:00:00 You know, I never I didn't actually play tactics ogre. I just know it's another part of that of that genre genre
01:00:07 genre
01:00:09 What was I talking about? Um, oh fandoms revenge
01:00:13 Oh, I've been I've been putting I've been putting a lot of finishing touches on it lately
01:00:16 I've been making a lot of like I've been trying. I've been beautifying it
01:00:20 I've been making lots of like fancy game objects that have like little effects that have like bubbling effects and little little motion effects
01:00:26 And I've been making like background details to make
01:00:29 Every room in the game look like a little different and distinct and stuff and I'm and I'm just kind of
01:00:33 Uh, uh, I've been I've been working. I've been going really hard lately
01:00:37 Like it feels like I'm in the final stretch and now I'm like
01:00:43 I'm focused. I'm laser focusing in on it. It's it's coming together. It's already a masterpiece
01:00:48 It's not even done, but it's already a masterpiece even if it's current state by the time it's finished
01:00:53 It'll be the greatest thing ever made by a human
01:00:56 Uh, I'm I'm very proud of you my son. It's so cool
01:01:01 I you can I can play I can basically play through
01:01:05 most of the game currently it just needs like
01:01:08 It just needs it needs it needs bug squashed and it needs um, and it needs like, you know
01:01:14 Polish and it needs like backgrounds fixed and like and a little more variety
01:01:18 In in the environments and and and the final boss needs to be finished
01:01:23 How how long how long is it going to be?
01:01:26 I think uh
01:01:29 Well as you're uh as as one of your um as one of your
01:01:34 Uh benefactors you will release this game. Uh before quarter four earnings are uh
01:01:40 Are up so
01:01:42 Make sure to get that out before then uh do whatever you need to do time to crunch time to crunch time
01:01:47 Time to crunch. We got it. We got to hit our we got to hit our quarterly goals
01:01:51 Uh, uh, just make sure make sure you don't get a job at Activision
01:01:55 A playthrough
01:01:57 I think
01:01:58 I think my goal will be that you can probably beat it in maybe like a couple hours
01:02:05 Of like trial and error and like oh, maybe like two hours of like
01:02:10 Of trial and error figuring it out. I mean
01:02:14 The the
01:02:15 Like if you know if you know exactly what you're doing, I think you could probably beat it in like five minutes
01:02:20 um, but you know the the real game is like figuring out how to
01:02:25 survive and and win I mean the
01:02:28 The first game I made when I was like 16 was kind of like that
01:02:32 The alpha version that I put out on patreon a few months ago was
01:02:36 Very very hard. I think it was too hard only like six people beat it
01:02:40 And those people took like five hours to beat it or or longer because it was just so much like trial and error
01:02:46 They had to find like the exact right combination of of of moves that like would not would result in in not death
01:02:52 And they were like there was like zero room for error at all
01:02:56 So I've I've made it a little I've added some more like commands and some more like options that make it a little less punishing and a little more like
01:03:05 You can you have you have ways to like sort of
01:03:10 You have moments in the game where you can kind of like take a breather and sort of set yourself up for what you want to do next
01:03:16 It's not like
01:03:17 The in the alpha version you would beat a level and it would immediately put you into the next level
01:03:21 And if you weren't like set up if you haven't like planned on exactly what state you wanted your game to be in
01:03:26 You would get there and you'd be like it's already too late. I've already fucked up
01:03:29 It's like uh like those old sierra adventure games where you can make like yeah, I was I was good. I was I was gonna fuck you six hours in
01:03:37 Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna mention those. It's like you need to know the exact thing to do
01:03:42 Like in those old adventure games. Yeah, the the alpha version is you you literally to the way that you
01:03:48 Could beat it is first you had to figure out like okay
01:03:51 What do I need to do to survive and then you would eventually figure out? Ah, okay
01:03:57 This is the goal and then you'd be like, okay, but to actually accomplish that goal
01:04:03 Okay, I I have to basically I just have to like
01:04:06 Trial and error over and over again and just try like slightly different strategies until I happen to find the one
01:04:12 That works and and means and and you have to and you have to execute it perfectly
01:04:16 And if you miss click any button at any point your strategy will be thrown off
01:04:20 You'll take damage that you can't afford to have taken and you'll be like well, there's no way I can win now
01:04:24 I gotta start over
01:04:25 Uh, very funny. I played another I played another game like that recently a few months ago
01:04:32 It's a wonder boy in monster lands
01:04:35 There is uh, no, I'm thinking of a boy in his blob
01:04:39 Yeah, this is okay. What's that?
01:04:41 This is like a this is like an arcade game
01:04:43 But they tried to do like rpg elements in it, but it's also like level level based
01:04:48 So like if you miss an upgrade like for example, I missed a sword upgrade
01:04:53 So once I got to a certain level it was like real impossible to beat the boss
01:04:58 So it's like I well by fucked up. So I guess I have to start the game over and get the sword
01:05:04 I'm adding I added a
01:05:06 okay because um
01:05:09 I added a command to phantom's revenge called scout
01:05:12 Which lets you look before you go to the next room you can use the scout command and it will tell you
01:05:18 How many enemies are at are like are going to be waiting for you in the next room
01:05:23 So like if you know what you're doing you can use that information and be like, oh, okay
01:05:27 Then I should I should I should set up like this
01:05:29 I should I should make sure that like this thing is is doing this thing before I go otherwise. I'll I'll die
01:05:35 uh
01:05:36 And that's me being very generous. I'm a generous developer
01:05:40 Uh, I'm I'm making dark souls here. You can beat it on your first try. You just have to pay attention to your environment
01:05:47 You know you just have to you just have to be aware of your surroundings
01:05:50 And you never have to take any damage. That's not true
01:05:53 Yeah, uh
01:05:56 the
01:05:57 Okay
01:05:58 Enough of me gushing about my own video game
01:06:01 Uh
01:06:03 It's gonna be it's gonna be great though. It's gonna be so get excited everyone. Yeah, it's so fucking good. It's so fucking hype
01:06:10 Are you gonna release on like itch and steam or whatever? I will put it on. Well, I don't think I'm gonna put it on steam
01:06:16 Okay, I wasn't I don't even know if you can put it on steam
01:06:19 I wasn't planning to sell it for money. I was just gonna put it on. I mean I'm gonna put it on my website
01:06:23 I'm gonna put it on itch. I guess I'll probably put it on new grounds because why not
01:06:27 Yeah, I've never had pretty well on new grounds
01:06:30 What can you Tom's game? Oh, yeah, Tom's yeah, I I've never uploaded anything to new grounds
01:06:35 So I don't even know how it works, but uh, yeah, I guess can you actually like
01:06:39 Export like a game maker games to html
01:06:43 Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what you do. Oh, wow
01:06:46 I made I made one before I made a much simpler one for the champion my other comic a few years ago
01:06:52 And yeah, it's just it's an html
01:06:55 It's just goes it's just embedded in my in a page of my website
01:07:00 Man, I was uh, I was more active on new grounds in the old days when all you had was flash
01:07:05 Yeah, you could you could only make flash games
01:07:08 I saw
01:07:10 I was
01:07:11 That's just oh, I think
01:07:12 I mentioned this because this was you told me about this the interview the the the thing where laser bot was on the
01:07:18 Was on the the panel and he barely fucking got in at all until the very end. I was so
01:07:25 The fact that it was it was the clock gang the clock gang from like the old new grounds days
01:07:32 It's like I can't I can't believe the clock gang is still a thing even at the time
01:07:37 I remember when it was contemporary. I remember like being like baffled like what is the deal with this clock?
01:07:41 Like what is the point? What are these people thinking? Why are they doing this?
01:07:47 I think I I think it started with strawberry clock. He made a movie called B
01:07:52 And it was just a red B on a white background and like people like ironically liked it
01:07:58 I see
01:07:59 and
01:08:01 I don't know like the whole history of it, but it started, you know, I guess I guess I'm jealous
01:08:05 I guess I'm jealous that they were a bunch of like internet content creators
01:08:09 Who formed who formed a tight-knit click?
01:08:12 And then they fucking they web they weathered the storm together
01:08:16 Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, they didn't they didn't crack under pressure
01:08:20 And I'll and I'll turn on one another
01:08:23 And I'll quit and I'll rage quit the podcast and become and become bitter enemies
01:08:27 Yeah, like like kermit and the muppets didn't like it. Yes, like that's who I was thinking of. Yes, like kermit and the muppets
01:08:34 Nobody else
01:08:36 No just kermit and the muppets
01:08:38 The the the the great tragedy of the hubris everything that's ever happened in real life is also applicable
01:08:45 details gets trolled so
01:08:49 That's how it goes
01:08:50 That is how it goes
01:08:52 I would I would have to agree. I would have to agree with you on that
01:08:56 Uh
01:08:59 I gotta say, um
01:09:01 I'm I'm really impressed with what gibb did because
01:09:05 She actually had to like print out the books herself and like send them out manually
01:09:11 Which is probably yeah, you did that too and I did that too
01:09:15 Yeah, you did that too. Hey, I'm right. Hey, praise me
01:09:19 No, no, I just I you're impressed with me. I've done that like three times. I'm way better. I'm way better than that
01:09:26 No, okay. No, you're not. Anyway, um
01:09:29 Uh, I just I just mentioned gibb because we were talking about the Kickstarter earlier. Yeah, but um
01:09:37 Yeah, it's a lot harder than what I did
01:09:39 Basically, all you have to do is just upload the um pdf and they like print it out
01:09:44 for you
01:09:47 Yeah, I've never done a um, I've never done a uh an amazon
01:09:51 The the the the downside is that they take like part of the money
01:09:55 Obviously, of course
01:09:58 Well, I guess you would have to do if you printed it yourself too, you'd have to pay for a printing cost
01:10:03 I'm yeah, I I'm sure I'm sure that it's cheaper and more efficient to like to print yourself in like large batches
01:10:10 Because you know
01:10:11 Amazon they're they're print on demand. So they don't they don't have like
01:10:15 Backlog, right? You don't have to pay upfront to have to have like, you know, 500 copies produced to be sold later
01:10:22 But you know with that with that I'm sure it comes an increase like, you know percentage that they take
01:10:28 Yeah for that serve for that service, right, which is which is part of the reason it's 30 dollars because uh,
01:10:35 sure
01:10:36 um
01:10:37 We wanted to make a profit from it. So we had to increase the price
01:10:42 Yeah, I mean absolutely
01:10:44 um, and if you combine the shipping costs and the um
01:10:49 If you combine the shipping cost and the amount that amazon takes we couldn't sell it for like cheaper than like 20 dollars
01:10:57 That's like that's like the the profit line
01:10:59 Yeah, that's like the minimum we could sell it for
01:11:02 Oh, yeah
01:11:04 Yeah, and they wanted me to use like the like I wanted to make the book as big as possible
01:11:09 But they if you do that they also like make you like use the more expensive paper
01:11:14 Which also increased the price. So, yeah
01:11:17 I see I see. Yeah, it's
01:11:20 I mean, I'm sure amazon is
01:11:22 a bitch and uh, you know
01:11:25 It's set up to extract as much surplus value as they possibly can
01:11:29 Yeah, thanks. Jeff. Thanks. Jeff Bezos, but uh, thanks
01:11:33 Some some people some people complained about the price, but I made a poll asking
01:11:38 Would you rather have a a smaller book with worse quality that's cheaper or a more expensive book that's better quality
01:11:44 And most people said the latter. So I was like, oh, okay, whatever. Yeah, I think I would agree with that
01:11:50 What are the dimensions of the book?
01:11:53 Yeah
01:11:54 Like, uh, what's the how big is it?
01:11:57 Hang on. Let me see if it says it's it says on the amazon. It's like
01:12:03 Going from memory. It's like, oh
01:12:06 Eight eight eight eight and a half by about like 11 and a half. That's pretty big
01:12:11 Yeah, that is pretty big. That's bigger. I was picturing like a
01:12:15 Like a digest like a paper bag. Yeah. Yeah, I was I was picturing like digest size. Okay. That's pretty that's bigger than I thought then
01:12:22 Yeah
01:12:24 That's the biggest I could make it and if if I made it smaller
01:12:27 I'd have to like cut up the panels and like rearrange them
01:12:30 Oh, yeah
01:12:31 Because because they're like because the original tales gets told pages are like vertically long
01:12:36 Sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah
01:12:39 I um, I was thinking, um, wait
01:12:43 Fuck uh, fuck. Oh, no. What was I thinking?
01:12:47 What were we just talking about? Oh, no
01:12:49 No, uh
01:12:52 Book sizes book sizes book sizes
01:12:55 book sizes
01:12:58 book sizes
01:13:00 Book sizes printing page page sizes
01:13:05 rearrange
01:13:07 money
01:13:09 Amazon it's gone. It's gone
01:13:13 What a shame
01:13:15 It was gonna be really good
01:13:17 Oh, yeah, and people are gonna criticize or
01:13:20 probably nobody
01:13:22 Oh, what what is it? I I remembered I remembered I was I was gonna say that like no matter what price point you price that
01:13:27 Somebody's gonna complain about like, oh, it's too expensive. But oh, yeah. Well, I don't I don't care about that
01:13:34 You got you got it, you know, you got to price it how you got to price it and like it's largely not up to you
01:13:40 How much it costs to get something made, right? Like it is what it is
01:13:44 I know that's all I was gonna say. I was also gonna say if like, uh
01:13:49 Uh, right wing people would probably say to me. Oh, you're you're like you're like on the left
01:13:53 But like you use amazon. Isn't that like hypocritical?
01:13:58 And they're right. Yeah, it is but I don't care
01:14:03 I have to I have to make a deal with the devil to make tales get told become a reality
01:14:07 That's what I have. No, but if you do that, then you won't get angel deals later in the run
01:14:11 I don't care
01:14:14 Yeah, you die now. Why are you doing it's a it's a it's a trap. It's a trap angel deals better
01:14:20 You want those soul hearts the angel deals are better now ever since uh repentance or whatever
01:14:25 Angel deals were good even back in the day. They were good, but they weren't good enough, you know
01:14:30 Like it's it's better because devil deal items were just so good
01:14:35 Yeah
01:14:37 I think I just liked them better. I just I like I thought they were cooler
01:14:40 I I think they're cooler too because you know, you got to wait a little longer for them and
01:14:44 A lot of like the higher tier items like godhead and sacred heart are just they're just cooler to me than brimstone and like
01:14:52 Yeah, it might just be that I'm more more familiar with the devil items. So I'm coming up brimstone. Ah, I get it
01:14:58 It's like I get I think I get what this item's all about
01:15:02 Oh
01:15:04 Yeah, I I totally agree with whatever you said
01:15:08 We're talking about binding of isaac. Yeah. Oh, I I think I figured it was something like that
01:15:14 I think I I
01:15:17 I figured you were referencing some like that was the only like video game
01:15:20 I could think of would like heaven and hell shit. So I was like, yeah, they're probably well. What about uh guilty gear
01:15:27 Heaven or hell let's rock. Yeah
01:15:30 Yeah, but but you don't buy items in that
01:15:33 That's true. You buy the one thing. It's missing characters
01:15:37 for dlc
01:15:39 Do you I don't know. No
01:15:42 I hope not. I know there's a season pass. There's always a season pass is the fighting game
01:15:47 I don't even know what that means
01:15:49 You know, it's like post launch like the game comes out and they add new characters and you paid for them
01:15:55 Oh and season pass is like you get whatever they release for the season. Yeah. Yeah
01:16:01 Okay, yeah, we uh life is hell
01:16:06 Uh, yeah, it's the common. It's the common state of games these days. Whatever
01:16:11 It's what it is
01:16:13 Well, well darn, so uh, what will what post launch content will uh will phantoms revenge have been?
01:16:20 Uh
01:16:21 Fucking hell. I'll add a I'll add a you should give them a Santa hat wait
01:16:26 Wait, what if I added what what if I added skins where you could where you could swap phantoms is different ponies like you could play as keg
01:16:33 Ooh, like you could play as that should be like honestly. This would be like honestly
01:16:36 It wouldn't even be that hard
01:16:38 I could I could probably add that in like a day if I wanted to like care. Yeah, like a hard mode character select
01:16:44 Yeah keg mode
01:16:46 You know what?
01:16:47 It wouldn't even be hard. It wouldn't even be hard
01:16:51 There you go. Oh, you heard your first books
01:16:55 Is this is this a brony game? It is no
01:16:59 It's it's a brony game. That's why it's that's why it's not a brony game grounds people are gonna get mad at him
01:17:04 tbap is like tbap is like a pony show for anti-bronies
01:17:09 What's an anti-brony I'm like a fallen brony like I'm like I took the devil deal. I'm like a black
01:17:16 Yes, I'm like a blaggard. I'm like I'm like I'm like a I'm like a a blaggard to the bronies paladin
01:17:23 Yeah, well, you that's how you say yeah, it is actually I only found out recently that you're supposed to pronounce black
01:17:29 When I know that like the actual english word is pronounced blaggard
01:17:34 But the I'm not sure if the d&d class is meant to be pronounced like the word or if it's
01:17:40 If it's distinct enough as its own thing that you're just supposed to say black guard
01:17:44 I think you can do either or but I know that in fifth edition are technically isn't a black guard or a blaggard
01:17:49 They're actually called like the uh the oath breaker
01:17:53 And I mean tomato tomorrow. Yeah, it's it's all the same difference
01:17:57 It's technically not even supposed to be a player class because it's in the dmg, but you know people still play it
01:18:01 I mean same with same with third edition. Yeah
01:18:04 Yeah, they still want people playing dark knights or whatever you want to call them. No
01:18:09 No, we can't have that
01:18:12 Yeah, we can't we can't have that
01:18:15 That sounds like a very bad idea. What are we talking about? Um, oh
01:18:21 Kegmo
01:18:24 Honestly the the the the like all my assets are like
01:18:30 Like swapping out sprites is like the easiest part
01:18:33 Making making sprites and swapping them out is the easiest part of development. It's not hard. What's hard
01:18:39 Is just fucking is just having a bug and hunting for it for like six hours. I yeah
01:18:44 That's that's the the part that's difficult. Everything else is cake
01:18:48 That's that's always that always seems like something that isn't very hard to implement in the game
01:18:52 but it's still like nice to have like uh
01:18:55 Well as a cave story has a mode
01:18:57 And like the re-releases where you can play as curly brace and all it does is change like
01:19:02 Just changes the character spray and like she talks sometimes and that's it
01:19:05 But it's fun because you know, I would like curly brace
01:19:08 I would simply I would simply have to create a a palette swapped set of sprites
01:19:15 and then just add like a little a little script into
01:19:19 The the the game object that is because phantom horn is is an is an
01:19:24 He's his own object in the game that has his own like behaviors
01:19:27 so I would simply have to like and he has a set of of of um sprites sort of built into him that are like
01:19:34 This is his normal sprite. This is his running sprite. This is guarding attacking
01:19:39 all these various
01:19:41 Things I would just have to add like another like a flag to be like if keg mode true
01:19:46 Then use this set of sprites instead of these set of sprites. Yeah, and that would be it. It would that would just do it
01:19:53 um
01:19:54 Lamal
01:19:56 Well, fuck. Hey, don't uh fucking ellias are cut all that
01:20:00 Cut all that uh because I don't want anyone to know
01:20:03 That should be a secret that feels like a secret that I just spoiled before I even thought to do it
01:20:08 Now and now I don't know if I can even resist the temptation. Hey mom's the word. I won't say anything. I won't say nothing
01:20:14 But I can't do it. I just want to credit him until
01:20:18 Okay, okay
01:20:20 But I can't but I can't do it. Okay. Here's the thing. I might tonic improv
01:20:24 Here's what I'm gonna do. I might do it
01:20:26 But I I won't let myself do it until the game is done
01:20:29 There you go. And then once once it's done then maybe as a treat. Maybe I will be like, okay. I guess I can add keg mode
01:20:38 Uh
01:20:39 Perfect, it's one obviously it's once you beat it. You have to unlock it
01:20:45 Uh
01:20:46 Anyway
01:20:48 What forget forget everyone forget everyone forget I said all that don't tell anyone about that
01:20:52 That's the secret. No problem listener. That's just between that's just between you and me
01:20:56 Mwah
01:20:57 You mentioning cave story, which is one of my favorite games. It made me think like how much of the um
01:21:03 content from
01:21:05 The um later versions was actually made by uh, uh
01:21:10 uh
01:21:11 So I actually know quite a bit about this
01:21:14 because uh
01:21:15 because of reasons but um
01:21:18 I know a lot of the uh the side like the extra content that nicholas added in the ports
01:21:24 Isn't made by him, but a surprising amount is like a the wind fortress level
01:21:29 Yeah, that's the one I knew about he made that that was just like a cut level from the game. Um,
01:21:34 I know he did
01:21:37 Uh, I he did the redrawn sprites that like, you know, they're higher res
01:21:41 I think he if he didn't do them personally
01:21:44 I know he supervised them or was like he gave the go ahead on them
01:21:48 But uh, yeah, that's that's what that's one of the few things I like from the newer versions because they're they're
01:21:52 They're in the same style and everything just I like them higher resolution. Yeah, I like them
01:21:56 but I also think the original sprites have their own charm, but um
01:22:00 Yeah, uh, all the other challenge modes all the other challenge maps are actually all fan fan creations
01:22:07 That uh that nicholas like yes, uh offered to put into the game people accepted like uh
01:22:12 And some of them I believe like some of the creators of the challenge maps actually got jobs at nicholas for some time
01:22:18 Uh through through that, but yeah, most of the most of the side stuff. Uh, it wasn't made by pixel
01:22:25 Well, I was I was wondering about the um
01:22:28 The curly brace mode because I doubt he wrote the dialogue for that, but I'm not sure. No, I'm actually yeah
01:22:33 I'm not sure either. He doesn't she doesn't really say anything too substantial
01:22:37 But yeah, well, I remember it because I played it for like 10 minutes. Yeah, and I know she I know she does say stuff, but
01:22:44 It's uh, it's cool nonetheless. Like I said, it's just a small little thing. They added that's like, uh, that's cool
01:22:50 I'll play I'll play curly this time instead of uh
01:22:53 step quote
01:22:55 on honestly, I would uh
01:22:58 Maybe I could give cave story a replay. I've played it before I've I've beaten
01:23:02 I've beaten it all the way through even the secret ending which I beat. Yeah, I've beaten the secret ending which version
01:23:09 On the pc the old old pc release. Okay, like the original freeware one
01:23:15 Yeah, yes. Yeah
01:23:17 um
01:23:19 But it's it's so good. I could I could I could it's been long enough that I could maybe give it another you could definitely beat it in a day
01:23:26 Yeah, it wouldn't be that hard. You could probably even do like a stream of it
01:23:31 Oh, it's a good ass video game. It's really good. It's one of my favorites as well
01:23:37 Yeah
01:23:39 Man, I I know it's like really controversial, but I just
01:23:43 The nicolas thing just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Yeah
01:23:47 It's it's definitely. Oh, wait, you made a video about I did. Yeah, I made a video about it last year
01:23:53 So because that was um, there was yeah, I watched there was a lot of
01:23:58 Have you seen that cc?
01:24:00 Um, if I have I don't remember it
01:24:02 But that's one reason why I brought cave story up because I wanted to talk about that. Yeah
01:24:07 Yeah, sure go ahead go be my guest, but uh, yeah, I made a video talking about like the whole nicolas
01:24:13 uh
01:24:14 Thing in relation to cave story because there's a lot
01:24:17 nicolas is obviously not a very good company
01:24:20 Uh, since that was a since jason shrier like uploaded that upload he published that expose on kotaku a while ago
01:24:27 It's like tyrone order again that shitty ceo and all that jazz like the word culture sucks
01:24:32 Uh, and that that is bad. Yes, it sucks
01:24:35 But but uh alongside that just like it became more popular
01:24:39 To to say that nicolas stole cave story from pixel when there's really nothing
01:24:45 That proves that that even that
01:24:48 happened at all
01:24:50 It's yeah, I've I've I don't I don't remember if I watched your video enough or not
01:24:55 But I've done a lot of research on it myself and yeah, I came to the same conclusion like
01:25:00 It's not really clear like what the status is on that
01:25:04 It but I can understand why people think that because nicolas acts like they made cave story when they actually didn't
01:25:11 yeah, and you know, they're
01:25:14 They're within their right to you know, like talk about the game
01:25:18 And it too and they did do cave story plus that was all them
01:25:23 For the most part, you know with with like oversight by pixel obviously, but yeah, it's it
01:25:28 It just it's really
01:25:30 It's really hard to to say they didn't
01:25:34 Uh steel cave story when there's evidence of like other companies having terrible work relations with nicolas
01:25:41 but like
01:25:42 We we know you know that
01:25:46 Uh, tyrone and pixel they still follow each other on twitter. So they're obviously on good terms. There's
01:25:53 Pixel will always like talk about the game whenever whenever it's brought up by nicolas
01:25:59 there's
01:26:00 Really nothing
01:26:02 Nothing to really go on a lot of people like to point to the um, have you ever played carol blaster either of you? Yes?
01:26:08 Yes, I have
01:26:10 It's a I have also played carol blaster is actually a really good game
01:26:14 I I held off on playing it for a long time because I didn't because uh because I thought it wouldn't really like live up to cave story
01:26:20 And it's not I mean not it it is no cave story. It's it's a it's yeah, it's it's going for a different thing
01:26:26 It's not like yeah
01:26:28 It's not in the same vein of cave story and like the this it's it's it's a it's a side scrolling like action shooter
01:26:35 It's not like a a a metroidvania like yeah, it's exploration like story game, but uh
01:26:41 Uh, it is a really good game and I like it a lot and a lot of people will point to like the plot of carol blaster being about like
01:26:48 There's just like one tweet by this guy who's like if you ever
01:26:52 I know exactly what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, or basically like he he just
01:26:57 He equated the plot of carol blaster to real life experiences that may have happened between pixel and tyrone rodriguez the the CEO of uh
01:27:07 But it's just but it really is just speculation and and it it's interesting how people come up with their own conspiracy theories like
01:27:15 Oh, uh pixel put tyrone in the in the credits as special things, but he was being sarcastic
01:27:21 Yeah, yeah, and he actually and he actually hates him. It's or whatever
01:27:25 It's really strange because I feel because he's only he's only they're only following each other on platter
01:27:30 So he's only following him on twitter to be polite or whatever. I that's another I really I really don't know what the make of
01:27:37 everything because like
01:27:39 Because like before I played carol blaster
01:27:42 I just uh and like before I looked into the whole cave story stuff
01:27:45 I really just did assume that they probably did take cave story because it's a really easy thing to believe but
01:27:50 You know when I saw that he was thanked when tyrone was thanked in the
01:27:54 In the game itself that kind of made me like raise an eyebrow a bit and kind of want to research it and um
01:27:59 Well, I there's this um, there's this guy his name super something zero who can who really did a lot of the research
01:28:06 And we wait super what zero super something zero
01:28:10 Yeah, but what oh very funny so funny
01:28:12 Yeah, he he's really the one responsible for a lot of the research for that video
01:28:17 Uh, he has like a he has like a master thread. He posted on twitter like a little while ago that um
01:28:24 That kind of chronicles like all the evidence for and against the the whole cave story nicolas thing and it
01:28:31 It really just reads to me that that uh, I don't think I don't think uh pixel
01:28:38 I don't think pixel got the game stolen from him
01:28:42 Uh, maybe maybe nicolas has some sort of like rights agreement to exclusively publish it
01:28:48 but um
01:28:50 But that's not really the same thing as it being as the ip it's wholesale being stolen from the man
01:28:55 I don't know. It's it's this whole snafu
01:28:58 And not that said I don't think that like I don't think nicolas is a good company. I think they I think they suck
01:29:04 But yeah, they they do suck and you should probably just buy carol blaster instead of getting like cave story plus or whatever on steam
01:29:12 Yeah, you if you play cave story get the a free version
01:29:16 Yeah, because there's a lot of mods you can find for the free version that that kind of spruced it up a bit
01:29:21 If you if you're interested in that but if you want like the uh
01:29:25 Original experience. It's always it's always still there. It's always on the the fan site
01:29:30 Hmm. Uh, I did I did talk to someone on twitter who uh, I don't remember if it was super something zero, but um
01:29:38 I did talk to someone who emailed a pixel and they said something like
01:29:44 Caves uh nicolas um got the
01:29:48 they have like the um
01:29:51 Similar to what used to like the publishing rights or something like they um have uh
01:29:56 Uh, they're like allowed to use the characters. I know that because they uh because they show up in a bunch of nicolas's other games
01:30:05 Yeah, I'm trying to find exactly what he said
01:30:10 But uh, they're allowed to use what what quote and curly yeah quote curly brace the doctor ballos, whatever
01:30:15 Whoever whoever really they like the the characters from the games. They're ballos. Is that the that's the that's the secret villain of the game spoilers everyone
01:30:25 Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, I thought I thought you were talking about ball rock. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, they're definitely not allowed to use ball
01:30:32 He's the only one they didn't get in the in the divorce
01:30:35 Wait, okay. Yeah, you're telling you're telling you're telling one of those patented lies again
01:30:40 One of those patented tectonic problem. I can't help myself
01:30:44 I'm just so unaccustomed such trickery
01:30:48 I thought you were serious at first. No, no, I think I think ball rock even is in someone like this
01:30:55 Uh, like spinoff games that they made like the good listen. I'll give you I'll trade you
01:31:00 I'll trade you all the other characters. Just give me ball rock. No deal. I can never have ball rock in the um
01:31:08 In the physical version of cave story plus they released on switch like years ago. They came with uh, they came with like a bunch of goodies
01:31:15 Uh, one of them was like a keychain that would be it would be uh, it was either
01:31:20 Quote curly brace or bow rock and I got a little bow rock keychain. I still have it
01:31:25 I wanted the curly brace one. That's pretty good. But uh, bow rocks pretty cool, too
01:31:29 Yeah, I agreed. Did you play the original v version of cave story because I was like really bad
01:31:35 That's how uh, that's how I first ever played the game. And yeah, I like released in a pretty rough state
01:31:40 But I think they fixed it up in some way
01:31:43 Yeah, a little bit
01:31:45 actually
01:31:47 That's sort of what happened to me. I heard the I heard the we version was coming out and
01:31:52 I was like, oh, I should play the original first
01:31:55 I so I I I played it at the same time as the we version, but I didn't play the we version
01:32:00 I think I thought but I did I did later and it sucked
01:32:03 I think I've played every every version of cave story
01:32:07 Uh, that's that's been released in some regard like I played the free war one. I played the we were one
01:32:12 I played the the steam port
01:32:14 Uh, I did you play it? Did you play the one on psp?
01:32:17 Yeah, no, because that was that was that was a fan one, right?
01:32:20 I know there's yeah, there's a fan one on the psp
01:32:23 And I want which version I really want to play is the fucking someone ported it to the Sega Genesis
01:32:28 So I really want to play that one
01:32:30 Oh, I played I played some of that actually
01:32:33 That's that's really cool. I'd love I love it if someone could port it could port it to the the SNES
01:32:40 Yeah, I actually played it on my uh, Genesis mini
01:32:42 I have I have a SNES now my old roommate gave me his his super nintendo. I just gave you one
01:32:48 He just yeah, he just didn't want it anymore or he he he was trying to pack light
01:32:52 And he was just like anyone want my super nintendo. He only had like three games for a thing
01:32:55 He had like super mario kart. Not bad, which I don't like
01:32:59 It's definitely the first mario kart
01:33:02 Kirby Kirby superstar, which is a plus. Oh, that's that's an amazing game
01:33:06 Yeah, yeah, so that's a winner and actually I think it might have just been those two
01:33:10 So I was a little I was you know, pretty disappointing, but I mean he had one good game. So, you know, all right
01:33:14 Yeah, I'll take all all for free. That's a pretty good deal
01:33:17 My friend my my friend did that with his dream cast. He just sent me his dream cast because he doesn't play it anymore
01:33:23 Well, one of my friends was offloading his like Genesis games
01:33:26 And he gave me like all three sonic games like a spider-man game and like a quack shot the donald duck game actually and uh
01:33:34 And some other like playing game. It was like
01:33:36 It's like, oh, oh, wow. Thanks. And they're all in like the cases. He's like, it's like how much you want for him
01:33:41 He's like, oh 20 books
01:33:43 It's like, oh word. Thanks. I still have those line around somewhere. Make it 19. Make it 19. All right
01:33:51 You drive a hard bargain there. Yeah, pretty cool
01:33:54 Yeah, I still have my uh, super nintendo from when I was a kid
01:33:58 I I have it. I have it packed away. I bought a um, I bought a super nt
01:34:02 like a few years ago, which is basically just like a
01:34:06 It's it's like a console that emulates the hardware to like a very fine level
01:34:11 That uh, that like upscales at the 1080p. It's very it plays like original cards. It's really cool. It's a really cool piece of tech
01:34:19 And uh, yeah, I've and I got a I got a flash cart a little while ago too
01:34:23 So I really don't have a need for my old
01:34:25 SNES carts
01:34:26 But you know, I like to keep them around because a lot of them I've had for a really long time
01:34:31 I
01:34:32 So I fucking I
01:34:34 I think I sold my I know I sold my NES
01:34:36 Yeah, which was really fucking stew. I sold the fucking game stop
01:34:41 Yeah, I was
01:34:43 I wasn't idiot stop
01:34:45 I wanted to buy like PlayStation games or something. So I sold my NES and a bunch of my
01:34:50 Old cartridges. I even I sold Kid Icarus, which was a kind of rare game. I think they gave me like eight dollars for it
01:34:56 So that was stupid. Yeah, they gave me like bullshit for that. I might have sold my super my old super nintendo 2
01:35:03 Uh, I don't even remember. I don't think I have it anymore
01:35:07 Uh, I didn't have that many games. Anyway, I have like mario rpg
01:35:12 Sue secretive mana. Those are probably not that rare. It's not rare, but they're definitely expensive
01:35:19 Yeah, fuck
01:35:21 You're uh, wait, if you if you don't mind biting the bullet, you could definitely look into getting like a secretive mana and mario rpg
01:35:31 Looking into getting away. Look into getting like a flash cart or something
01:35:36 They uh, oh man secretive mana on the super nintendo
01:35:40 50 60 bucks 60 bucks for one of those. Yeah, a lot of the the square games are pretty expensive
01:35:47 Um
01:35:49 Or everyone knows how expensive earthbound mario rpg is a hundred is over a hundred. It's like a hundred to a hundred fifty
01:35:55 I think chrono triggers around that same price too. It might be even more. Yeah
01:36:00 No
01:36:01 It's a mix of nostalgia and covet covet spiked a lot of game prices
01:36:07 Well, it's um, have you seen have you seen the I think carl yobbs just put out a video about like the like the
01:36:15 The the the bubble right then that company from wada. Yeah. Yeah, I was um, I watch uh
01:36:20 Pathy nes punks like podcast say does with uh with his friend ian and they've been talking about this stuff for years
01:36:26 But it seems like it's finally getting mainstream, which is uh, which is good because it is a it's a racket
01:36:32 For those unaware watch the video. It's a great vid
01:36:37 Yeah, I was I was pissed off because there were so many articles about oh this copy of super mario
01:36:43 Told for two billion dollars and i'm like, okay, I don't fucking yeah
01:36:46 It's just the it's just the same three people like buying and selling it back to each other to try and like
01:36:51 Create a market that didn't exist. It's the same thing that happened to like comic books and stuff. They're just finally moving on to games
01:36:57 Yeah, it's it's uh, it's nuts. I wish it wouldn't um
01:37:02 Because you know, they're sealed games and uh
01:37:06 And most people don't have like sealed box copies of mario 64, but that's not gonna think that's not gonna
01:37:12 Stop people from thinking that they're sitting on gold
01:37:15 On their like nhl 95 or whatever
01:37:18 Yeah, yeah, my my normie my normie six. Oh, sorry my normie sister texted me and was like
01:37:25 Oh, this guy sold super mario 64 for a billion dollars. We still have that game and i'm like, yeah, but
01:37:30 It's like not sealed and
01:37:33 That shit soup and also the scam thing which I didn't know about but I was still like suspicious
01:37:39 Wow, yeah a SNES a SNES sells for like 200 bucks. So pretty good for pretty good pickup on that. Yeah, that what's if
01:37:48 You can really like go
01:37:50 Like super nerd into it because there's like different types of super nintendo's like like uh on the inside
01:37:58 there's ones there's ones that um
01:38:01 There's ones that like really hardcore
01:38:05 Retro people really are out looking for it's called like a one chip SNES, which basically it
01:38:12 Outputs the the colors a little better. I think
01:38:16 Uh, yeah, it was like a later model, but it's still like the fat SNES
01:38:21 And then there's the uh the smaller like more compact version. I don't know which one you have but uh
01:38:27 I don't know either
01:38:30 What did I miss
01:38:32 Hey, give Gibbs here
01:38:35 The old the old the old one is more angular and square
01:38:38 And the new one is like rounded
01:38:41 Yeah, we've just having a jet button
01:38:45 And like in the middle you pushing it lets the game pop up if if so that was mine
01:38:49 That was mine in in when I was a kid that had the middle. Yeah
01:38:54 We've talked about any things
01:38:58 All right, I'll get it out of the box. Go find it right now
01:39:01 What is this button from uh, it says super nintendo or uh, uh
01:39:08 I almost called it. I was like as as the brits would know what a super famicom by the voice is called in the super nintendo over there
01:39:15 Yeah, wait, I think the only difference is the the controller has color. Yes buttons
01:39:21 Yeah, you guys got the colorful you got the colored buttons, which I never had a super nintendo
01:39:26 But a friend of mine did and I was like, oh
01:39:28 That's not like the angry video game nerve. The fuck is that?
01:39:33 It a lot of people really prefer the colored buttons on the uh on the super nintendo looks really nice here
01:39:38 I I like the colors a lot, but I really I really like the lavender
01:39:43 Colors they went with on the uh on the american version and I like that half of the color half of the buttons are concave
01:39:50 This this button. Yeah, this one does have this one does have the centrally jack button
01:39:56 Yeah, so is that good or bad that that means it's it's like a model one
01:40:00 It could be a one chip. I highly doubt it is one because they're like a later version or whatever
01:40:06 I don't know. I don't know if mine is a one shipper not, but it's the old uh box model
01:40:12 And yeah, I do think the concave buttons are better
01:40:15 Hmm true
01:40:17 Yeah, you'd have to you'd have to like open your you'd have to open the super nintendo to
01:40:22 To even like know if you had a one chip
01:40:24 It's it's really this is stuff that like really doesn't matter because you know
01:40:28 You're gonna be you're gonna be hooking up your super nintendo through like composite through like a crt. So it's not really gonna
01:40:34 It's not really gonna
01:40:40 I actually have a s video cable for my super nintendo, which is better than yeah, but not as good as
01:40:47 Uh rgb. Yeah, I think uh out of the box s video is probably the best
01:40:51 I think it's the best the super nintendo can do without like modding now. We're getting really heady
01:40:56 And I I think I think some models of the super nintendo have rgb built in
01:41:02 Maybe some of the later ones don't
01:41:06 Maybe yeah, maybe I don't know and uh back back to cave story. I was looking for the um
01:41:12 The guy I talked on twitter with and he posted this email because he emailed pixel
01:41:17 Yeah, I I still distribute if you were cave stories from my site. This is a con
01:41:21 This is a continuation with the special permission of nicholas
01:41:25 Yeah, it
01:41:26 Like like I remember this because this was um
01:41:30 This I think this uh this got passed around when uh when nicholas did like a cease and desist on some sort of like fan
01:41:38 Uh like decompiler mod for cave story, which sucks that they see indeed that's like it's shitty and they suck
01:41:45 But it doesn't like it doesn't prove they stole cave story or anything
01:41:51 I don't know. Yeah, who stole it. I know carol blaster
01:41:55 Uh cool the guy who made carol blaster also made cave story, right?
01:41:59 Have you played carol blaster kid but not cave story?
01:42:02 No, but I have seen
01:42:04 An analysis video about it
01:42:07 Oh, that small youtuber
01:42:09 And it was really looked pretty cool tectonic improv
01:42:13 Did you watch the matthew metosis video on carol blaster? I think that also
01:42:19 My favorite my favorite matthew metosis video is when he uh did a video on
01:42:24 The sonic james collection. Oh my god. That's such a great video
01:42:29 And he uh, he he talks one part is where he talks about
01:42:33 The character come character is coming out of rouge the bat bats vagina
01:42:37 But he says he says like no nonchalant. Yes that it's like hilarious
01:42:41 Or when he's talking about tails taking a stinky poo poo in his diaper. It's
01:42:46 It's probably it's it's it's it's as funny as video
01:42:51 By far
01:42:52 Yeah, uh, I should give it a rewatch. I haven't seen it. You should oh, there's uh
01:42:57 Has he made anything recently?
01:42:59 You mean the the last one he made was eight months ago. So no, I think I've have you heard what's going on with him
01:43:05 No, no. Oh, uh, yeah that well after he released the meta micro videos
01:43:10 video
01:43:12 He he announced on his like patreon that he's gonna he he's gonna like stop making videos
01:43:18 To uh, why he's making a game
01:43:20 Okay, I've seen some of those streams
01:43:23 I didn't really click on I clicked on one of them and he was like
01:43:26 Working with like a castlevania thing and he was talking through his process of figuring out movement
01:43:32 Yeah, he he wants to focus. He wants to focus on like game dev for a bit
01:43:37 And like uh, like maybe I'll go back to making videos at some point, but I'm not interested right now one of those like
01:43:44 It's probably a long time
01:43:46 Yeah
01:43:48 Yeah, I I always got the feeling like the fact that his videos were so slow. I got the feeling that he was maybe like
01:43:55 Thinking about others and he's he's talked in some videos about how he wanted to like write for video games before
01:44:01 And I was like, maybe he's
01:44:03 I guess I wondered like if he would ever like try to do like dev stuff
01:44:07 So I guess that's not a huge surprise. Yeah, good for him. Yeah, I'm excited to see what the sort of thing because like
01:44:13 Uh
01:44:14 If anyone is behind the design of a video game someone like him
01:44:20 You know presuming, you know, the game is the sort of game I would like it would be very well made it would be very considered
01:44:28 I disagree you disagree critics critic critics good critics don't make good artists all the time
01:44:36 Sometimes sometimes it just doesn't that's the that's the fear. Uh, maybe
01:44:40 Maybe I would I would think that his his approach is very thoughtful like he wants everything to have a purpose
01:44:46 I'm it could I'm not saying that he definitely won't make a good game, but I'm not
01:44:54 I don't I mean, oh, there's others just have to see
01:44:56 It's not I don't know many other like examples of critics making games. I know yatsi did but I haven't
01:45:04 I haven't really looked at that. Yeah, that that's that's actually the first thing I thought of when you mentioned that
01:45:10 about critics making their own games
01:45:12 Uh
01:45:14 I've only played the one yatsi game and it was really good. He's definitely aware of the uh of of that idea ben
01:45:21 When he's like when he's like, I'm didn't say
01:45:24 He wasn't I'm not saying I'm not saying you weren't not aware, but okay
01:45:29 I'm not saying that you weren't saying that I was saying
01:45:32 That he doesn't know I'm not saying anything about that. I'm on a podcast. Okay. Well, I mean well me either Ben
01:45:38 You've like critiqued certain things before
01:45:42 And then you're making a game
01:45:44 Really, and you know tom is also making a game and he critiqued my little pony. I've never
01:45:49 I've never criticized anything. I've never criticized anything
01:45:54 In plus I have only ever been criticized anything
01:45:59 Uh, remember in the that was the whole thing with my little pony was that I only said it was good
01:46:05 And I never said it was bad because that's what everyone wanted to hear
01:46:08 Uh, and and if you said that it was yeah
01:46:11 If you said that all you got to do is make a little pony ose and have her say this episode
01:46:15 Is really good and here are some things I liked about it and everyone goes yay
01:46:18 Eleazar Eleazar go back go back show is real go back Eleazar watch the entirety of t-bap
01:46:24 Clip out like a clip show of every time ben said yeah, I don't like it
01:46:29 Or excuse me every time phantom horn said I didn't like it
01:46:32 If you don't do that Eleazar it will just prove that I never said that damn it if you don't include
01:46:38 If you don't include any clips like that it will just mean that there were none
01:46:41 I don't like my little pony because it's for children
01:46:45 I don't like you because you're for children. I don't really like the process. What does that be podcast because it's you know
01:46:50 It's for children. It's not really. I don't I don't I don't I don't really like myself either
01:46:57 Oh, I want to say one I want to all want to see the fuck. I can't talk. I want to say one last thing about cave story
01:47:04 Okay, is that regardless of whether Nicholas stole it from him or not is
01:47:09 It's still like a way worse deal that he got for that than caro blaster because
01:47:15 For caro blaster. I think play is unpublished it. But like like, um
01:47:21 He still like owns all the rights to it
01:47:23 And gets money from it. Where whereas with Nicholas, it's like
01:47:27 people think like
01:47:29 Like tyrone tricked him or something into signing a bad contract. I don't know if that's true, but
01:47:34 it might be because it feels like
01:47:38 they
01:47:39 Are more involved with it than they should be
01:47:42 Which I think everyone already knows but yeah
01:47:46 Possibly, but you know, it might just be that he's not really interested in like working with cave story anymore because
01:47:53 I mean, I think I think that is like 15 years old
01:47:56 I think that's more likely because
01:47:58 Another thing like people come up with conspiracies conspiracy theories about is like
01:48:03 Oh, uh pixel wants to make a sequel to cave story, but Nicholas won't let him. I don't think that's true
01:48:09 That's that's out of I've heard that before and out of all the things that people say about about this controversy
01:48:15 That is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard because yeah
01:48:19 Out of out of anything
01:48:21 Everything that could possibly happen with that game. Nicholas would love if there was a cave story too
01:48:29 Because that that should just sells
01:48:31 That's that's yeah, you know that they obviously don't want to make it themselves and pixel
01:48:36 Probably doesn't want to do it either. So
01:48:39 They're milking the original
01:48:43 Yeah, and the game is already finished. It's
01:48:45 Find the way it is. Yeah. Oh, did you ever put did you ever play the 3d version because I didn't dude?
01:48:49 I did play minecraft. I played it
01:48:52 I've also played minecraft. It's a 3d version of caves stories caves stories
01:48:58 that you apparently
01:49:00 Apparently pixel also helped with that one. I don't know
01:49:03 It just that that that is what you just said about how Nicholas would love to make a cave story
01:49:10 Sequel that's kind of what they did with the 3d one. They're like, oh, we want to make this
01:49:14 But I doubt pixel like actually cared like he was probably like, oh, this is a stupid idea
01:49:18 But they're they want me to help with it. So I guess I'll help now. Did Nicholas make it or did oh, okay
01:49:24 Sorry, I thought nippon Ichi made it, but I think they just published it. I think
01:49:28 Yeah, you're right. I have no idea what any of this is about and I want to talk about minecraft now
01:49:34 Why well it's it's time for minecraft. I'm looking at I'm late. I'm looking at brown bridge
01:49:39 I'm looking at I'm looking at the matthew mitosis stream. He's playing as like simon belmont and he's just like jumping around
01:49:46 on a plane
01:49:49 Okay, maybe this is too early. Maybe it's too early to say this
01:49:55 I'm not impressed with what I'm seeing. Yeah, the stream isn't much
01:49:59 I think he's just talking to the viewer about like so I'm trying to think about how to
01:50:05 You know do movement and and collision with platforming
01:50:08 And he's he's doing all that like walking through so it's it's not visually interesting
01:50:14 Here's here's what I want to know. Does he have a night? Does he have
01:50:17 Okay, first impressions and maybe I'm totally off base. This does not fill me with confidence not because like oh, there's not many graphics or anything
01:50:24 it's because
01:50:26 It he's he's fucking around with mechanics. Like how do I build a state machine? It looks like he
01:50:31 Is experimenting with like mechanics
01:50:34 And like how to mechanically build a game
01:50:36 Which makes me think that he doesn't have like a game in mind that he like he doesn't have like an idea for a game
01:50:42 He wants to make like he's just kind of trying to figure it out
01:50:45 As he goes from what I understand on the patreon post
01:50:48 he like has like a couple of ideas for games that he wants to make and he's uh
01:50:53 He started off working on one
01:50:55 And then like his his I his plan was that like if he ever came across like a
01:51:01 Insurmountable problem in one project. He tried to move on he'd move on to another one and see and see how that worked
01:51:07 So I think he's on like the second one
01:51:10 Of like his couple of ideas and that one is just like a straightforward action platformer
01:51:14 You know or like a castlevania or whatever
01:51:17 Which is why which is why he has like the rector model
01:51:22 Yahtzee made a really good castlevania like or metroidvania. So I bet I bet you can do it too
01:51:29 I should play that
01:51:31 Uh, stop not stalker poacher poacher is really good. It's a really good little game
01:51:35 It'll probably be a while before we see anything
01:51:38 From this game of his which is kind of which which is a little sad because you know
01:51:43 That means there won't be any videos and you know, a matthew metosis video is is always
01:51:47 I feel like I've got my fill of matthew metosis
01:51:50 I I like seeing him his videos and the way he talks about things is
01:51:54 Is gooder than the his peers I would say
01:51:59 uh
01:52:00 But like in general
01:52:02 I know about video games now. I don't really need
01:52:06 Analysis videos about them. It's just sort of would be nice, but
01:52:11 I don't know
01:52:12 I'm too smart. Yeah, I feel I feel like the meta micro videos
01:52:16 Was uh was already kind of like a a sign that he was probably done. It feels like a final video, you know
01:52:25 I'm not I'm not shitting on my matthew in particular, but I'm just uh
01:52:31 I'm kind of done with like video essays personally
01:52:34 Like I don't want to watch like people talk about some shit for like three hours
01:52:39 I might as well just actually like play the game or watch the movie
01:52:41 I have I have I have contracted the number of like youtubers who's like video essays
01:52:48 I will watch there are still a few who I will like always watch anything they make
01:52:53 Uh, but that that number has gone down
01:52:56 significantly
01:52:57 I love it when people make like eight hour videos about
01:53:01 Stuff like that's like a full work day
01:53:04 It's perfect for me because I listen to stuff. I've been
01:53:08 I've yeah, that's true. I should do that
01:53:10 This week I've listened to
01:53:12 The uh the that one guy the patrician tv guy
01:53:15 He made this this the set the seven hour video about morrowan
01:53:18 And then he just I just finished like the other day
01:53:21 I listened to the uh the 12 hour one about oblivion
01:53:24 Can't wait for the 26 hour one about skyrim. I've never even played any of these games
01:53:30 12 hours is actually the cap on like uploads on youtube
01:53:34 So if it was 26 hours, it'd have to be three parts. Yeah
01:53:38 I noticed that it's exactly 12 hours long. It's 1200
01:53:43 And I was like, is that a coincidence?
01:53:45 I didn't I didn't even know there was a limit because I maybe they change 20 hour long videos before
01:53:51 Yeah, I have to maybe they changed it again
01:53:54 I think it's 12 hours at least maybe maybe it is when you're uploading stream vods
01:53:58 I am pretty sure in fact that I have seen like one of those memes like oh
01:54:02 It's a thing that it happens for 10 hours except it was 100 hours. Oh, you're you're right. You're absolutely right
01:54:09 Remember when uh the youtube limit was 10 minutes
01:54:13 Hell yeah, but if you those were the days, but if you're like role on youtube was director
01:54:18 You got to ignore that that was like your little director. Yeah, like early
01:54:23 I've never even heard early youtube had this like thing where like you picked like uh
01:54:27 I think it was like a genre of video you would upload and they all got different
01:54:32 Yeah, I know right. This is like so crazy to think about they all got like little perks
01:54:36 Uh, the only one I remember is that if you if you yeah your class like you speck into a class on youtube.com
01:54:43 And one of the classes was director and since you're a director you make movies like oh, okay
01:54:49 So as as a director you get to abscond the upload limit and upload videos. I think as long as you wanted
01:54:58 Well, I don't remember that at all
01:54:59 I all I remember is the partner program
01:55:02 And they used to
01:55:03 They used to make it so you couldn't make custom thumbnails unless you were in the partner program. Yes, that's all I remember
01:55:08 I remember I remember that as well. I I don't think I did it myself, but I do
01:55:13 remember
01:55:16 The the the technique of putting an image at the very middle part of a video so that it would become the thumbnail
01:55:22 Yeah, so while you're watching it, it'll just be oh the thumbnail image for like five ten seconds
01:55:29 Yeah, people tried to get around the system
01:55:32 It's it's really crazy to think how archaic shit was back then but also how shitty everything is now with youtube
01:55:41 Yeah
01:55:43 Now it's shitty in more deliberate ways. Yes
01:55:48 Now it's shitty in ways that serve them. I think
01:55:53 Oh, did you they uh
01:55:55 The fucking the the the draw cast which is the name of the channel
01:55:59 that has um oblivion fall
01:56:01 and teleperte and ctole
01:56:05 They um ctole messaged me. It was like, hey, can you help uh
01:56:08 spread this around
01:56:10 And uh youtube just terminated their channel
01:56:14 For like scam content. Yeah, I don't know what the hell that was about
01:56:19 No reason at all that I could see thankfully it's back. I think they got it back. Yeah, it's it's back
01:56:25 That's crazy, but like that was really bizarre. I've
01:56:29 They just said they it was like it was like scamming or like two like a couple other things
01:56:35 they said which is like just
01:56:38 not even
01:56:40 Just absolutely no logic behind it whatsoever that that that anyone could see
01:56:44 So I guess it was just like a glitch or something or just uh
01:56:49 I don't know a cosmic ray must have like flipped a transistor in there
01:56:53 In there in there come in there
01:56:55 Super computers at the youtube headquarters and it and it made this happen. I also wish for a testium
01:57:02 The isr on cast its gaze on the draw cast was it was over
01:57:07 It's back though now, right? Well, but it's back. So it's fine. All right. It's fine. All right. We're moving on
01:57:12 Yeah, but the eye of that's the thing about the eye of sauron it looks at you and then everything's over, but then it's fine
01:57:18 Yes
01:57:19 There's a gonna be an episode of me
01:57:22 on there soon
01:57:24 We recorded it a while ago
01:57:27 It's gonna be out the the the draw cast the draw cast animation. We had to make an animation real quick
01:57:33 Oh
01:57:35 And teleperty was on that one and of course and that was uh, well, that's not even fair. That's not even fair sure
01:57:43 Uh, but I still made people laugh. So I think I win. I think I win my I didn't embarrass myself
01:57:49 I thought I would but I didn't give one give one the moral victory
01:57:54 Sure, sure
01:57:56 Well, I'm jealous and then there was other like really good anime everyone else
01:58:00 Aside from sito who is not an animator on that on that draw cast was incredible
01:58:06 It's it's like it's like they're like professionals or something. They like draw for a living
01:58:17 Imagine drawing for a living couldn't be me that's for sure
01:58:21 Like literally it could not
01:58:24 Fuck
01:58:26 Fucking christ, dude, dude
01:58:29 It's same
01:58:32 I sneeze like that as well. I didn't think other people did
01:58:36 I heard I heard you uh, I heard you have an internet troubles kid
01:58:40 I was I was they were they worked out um
01:58:44 And it's all it's really good. Actually. It was like
01:58:47 30 25 to 30 megabit so megabytes per second upload, you know, whatever the thing says
01:58:55 I'm not upload download, but that's still really good. Yeah
01:59:00 Well, I mean we're at two hours
01:59:02 So it's almost time for us to be moving on to voicemails unless you've got like anything you wanted to to talk about
01:59:09 uh
01:59:15 Well, uh cc tech you guys good with uh with starting up the voice the voicemail segment
01:59:20 I would um of the procrastinator podcast. I would feel bad if I didn't if I didn't talk about uh a certain thing before
01:59:29 uh moving on to voicemails because um
01:59:32 Was the last couple of times the last couple of times on our 9 11
01:59:36 Yeah, well, we actually did that earlier on. Oh, but uh, yeah. Yeah, too late. Uh, well, I guess I
01:59:44 The last couple of times I was on this podcast I was uh between projects so to speak
01:59:50 um, uh, but um
01:59:53 And I really haven't been making a lot of videos recently, but I do I was uh
01:59:57 Involved in certain like collabs
02:00:00 Lately, uh one of which was this uh this thing called gaming and the golden record. It's a bunch of like uh
02:00:07 YouTube people came around and like were like the the basically the
02:00:12 The prompt was like what game would you uh, would you send off the space to like have aliens discover it?
02:00:18 You know like that uh super mario brothers
02:00:20 Yes, yes, I'm sure uh, I I believe that was picked by someone
02:00:25 But uh, I was I was involved in that video
02:00:28 Uh, someone asked me and I acquiesced and then just uh just last friday
02:00:33 Or uh a week ago as of this upload. There was another
02:00:37 Another little collab where a bunch of people got together and made one minute long essays
02:00:43 about basically anything and I um, I also was uh in that I talked about uh
02:00:50 I talked about the b-52s the band
02:00:53 Uh, and it's all it's all it's all uh back-to-back like yes the essays the video is all the essays together
02:00:59 Yeah, and they like another minute remain. That's more of my speed because video essays are getting too long these days
02:01:05 Yeah, that's like the whole I'd rather watch one. That's a minute. Yeah, it uh, I'm I'm I like the videos a lot
02:01:11 I think uh the the editing for the uh the minute long ones are are really well done
02:01:17 and in that like the
02:01:19 The through line is is pretty clear even though like everyone just kind of did their own thing and didn't really like work together
02:01:26 Uh, the editor hot sider. He did a really good job on that one and also I like the the golden rickard video as well
02:01:33 I was uh happy with my prompt
02:01:36 All right, uh, I guess we'll put links
02:01:38 Those down in the in the nice content
02:01:42 Do they do yeah nice con nice content world world very proud of you
02:01:47 I I need to get into more content creation, but uh, I'm too lazy. What game would I send out into space?
02:01:53 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, um fucking fans. I was revenge. Obviously. Yeah, uh, I got the tails gets trolled book
02:02:01 I got it. I bought it. I have it now. It's on my shelf. Oh, you beat me to it. I'm so happy
02:02:07 I still haven't gotten it's been selling pretty well, which is awesome
02:02:10 Me and laserbot haven't gotten our copies yet because uh, I ordered like free copy. Well, they're free except for the um
02:02:17 Production cost so it was like 10 dollars instead of 30
02:02:20 But they like they prioritize bought copies before um the free copies for authors
02:02:26 so
02:02:26 Me and laserbot haven't gotten ours yet, but I'm looking forward to that
02:02:31 Yeah, it's it's it's cool. I I knew this technology existed where you put up a book
02:02:37 Amazon prints it and sends it rather than you having to do any production
02:02:42 Yeah, print on demand is uh, I mean, it's it's very convenient, but I I never really looked into it
02:02:49 I was thinking about doing it for like my own comics, but apparently it's like it's better for
02:02:55 Uh written words
02:02:57 Um, like the quality of the paper is not like oh, uh smooth like
02:03:03 uh
02:03:05 Whatever you call it paper
02:03:07 Manga paper not manga paper a comic book stuck
02:03:11 This stuff and and the colors are a bit glossy the colors are a bit washed out, but
02:03:15 Um, it's cool. It's cool seeing tales and and him getting trolled
02:03:20 And all the events that that follow
02:03:23 I actually had to edit the colors myself, but because in the first copy that I ordered, um
02:03:30 Like, you know the parts where like luigi and the troll king are fighting in the cave and it's like really dark
02:03:35 Oh, yeah, I looked at those
02:03:38 That that whole part when I if you just put in the comic pages and print them as is that whole part is just like pure black
02:03:45 Yeah, I so I have lightened up
02:03:48 Yeah, I had to lighten it up manually
02:03:51 And the the other complaint I have is that it's really finicky about which like files
02:03:56 It accepts if it's like inside the margins at all it like freaks out and it's like oh, you can't submit this
02:04:01 So I had to like keep editing it over and over again
02:04:04 And I I have like four or five test copies
02:04:08 Because of that because I had to keep like changing it
02:04:11 But I think yeah, yeah
02:04:13 I think it turned out uh the final version turned out okay
02:04:17 Yeah
02:04:19 Well, I better get I better get one a bit of quick procrastinating
02:04:23 Yeah, what what what comic book wall what comic book shelf is is incomplete is complete without tales gets trolled next to the vapors chapter two
02:04:32 And don't forget your kato anthology book. Oh, I should got that a few weeks ago
02:04:38 I haven't I haven't got mine either. You know, I haven't checked my p.o
02:04:40 I haven't checked my p.o. Box in a while. So it could just be sitting in my p.o. And then soon the lord of ghosts comic
02:04:47 Oh
02:04:51 Yeah, congrats my my children
02:04:56 Uh, all right, so voicemail time I think before the voicemail I want to say one thing the reason I say
02:05:03 The reason I say stuff like that is because of the first sonichu
02:05:07 it uh, um
02:05:09 issue where
02:05:12 This is like the funniest uh sonichu thing in my opinion the the cover of the first one where
02:05:18 Chris says go out my son and zap to the extreme and then sonichu says I will thank you father
02:05:25 Yes, of course. I mean, of course. Sure, of course. I'm familiar
02:05:30 I'm I'm familiar with the material
02:05:33 It but that that's like the whole reason I like added that to my vocabulary because just because of that
02:05:39 It's go it's go sonichu go out and zap to the extreme. I will thank you father when when chris read it for like the audio
02:05:46 When chris did like a video where she where she flipped through the page and like narrated it live
02:05:51 The way that she said that she read sonichu's line was like I will thank you father
02:05:57 Just awful
02:06:01 That I will zap to the extreme
02:06:04 That sounds that sounds like her accent
02:06:07 But yeah, a little bit the way I imagined it is like I will thank you father. I will
02:06:13 Well, I would I mean in my head he just
02:06:16 I originally in my head. He just sounds like sonics. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah
02:06:21 Zap cool. Yeah roast juice hot. Yeah, we're gonna fuck. Yeah zap bow bow
02:06:27 Team rocket. No, thanks. I I know. Yeah, sonica is team rocky, but uh
02:06:33 I this might be controversial to the tales gets told fans because I know that the um the fan dub is like really popular
02:06:40 But I always usually read the characters voices and like their actual voices
02:06:46 Like uh, you know, I haven't actually heard the fan dub. So I I can't
02:06:51 But I mean, yeah, I would imagine that they sound like their characters
02:06:55 Uh, they they don't well some of them do but some of them don't like
02:06:59 The fan dub gives sonic like a really nerdy voice and he sounds like
02:07:03 Oh, yeah, take tales
02:07:05 Uh, this problem can be solved without any feelings. It doesn't sound anything like that, but it's like a similar. Um,
02:07:12 You know, I respect
02:07:14 It sounds like a bold artistic choice and you got to respect that
02:07:18 But it's it's it's funnier to read in like sonics actual voice because he says, you know, how it is, uh
02:07:24 The tales is getting trolled. They're calling him gay and shit. He can't take it because it's like something that the actual sonic would never say
02:07:31 and it's just funnier to
02:07:33 Imagine it in his voice. They're calling him gay and shit. He can't handle that
02:07:37 Yeah
02:07:39 That's no good
02:07:41 Remember kids if any trolls call you gay
02:07:46 That's no good. They should get you should tell shadow. They should bring Joliel white back
02:07:51 As the voice of sonic
02:07:53 To bring him back from the grave, you know, roger craig smith was gonna quit voicing sonic and I wish he did because
02:08:01 Like he sounds okay and like sonic boom, but like other than that
02:08:06 Uh, I don't really like his voice as much as the previous sonic voices. I think he's fine
02:08:11 I'm just more I just want them to just fucking stick to a guy, you know
02:08:15 And they've had roger craig smith for so long
02:08:18 They might as well just keep them like imagine if mario's voice changed every like five years
02:08:23 Yeah, uh, they've had uh roger for the longest so they might as well keep them
02:08:29 I know they like cut a bunch of the other I think
02:08:34 I thought I thought they would get like a different guy for like I mean, you know
02:08:38 The boom continuity is different from like the game continuity and yeah, that's that that's that's that's why that's why I think
02:08:45 Roger sounds best because it's like a different interpretation of sonic
02:08:49 Yeah
02:08:53 So I would assume they would have two different guys, but whatever
02:08:57 Um, well, they sort okay. Well, I don't I don't know. I was gonna say they did in the old days
02:09:01 But sonic didn't have a voice in the games me old days. Oh, yeah, that's true. He does
02:09:06 Well, actually actually actually I I take that back because
02:09:10 For um sonic underground
02:09:12 They got julio white but that was that came out at the same time as sonic adventure
02:09:16 So he actually did have two different voices
02:09:19 and then later when they did is
02:09:21 When he gets a uh a bubble of air doesn't he say something?
02:09:27 He talks in that doesn't he?
02:09:30 You know in sonic cd when you uh, you're when you're right when you when you run out of time. He says i'm out of here. Yeah, yeah
02:09:37 And I think I think a japanese woman voiced him there
02:09:41 Bass the same japanese woman who's saying the um tutut sonic warrior thing. Oh, no, I think that was the same one
02:09:48 This had her voice them there. That's pretty cool
02:09:51 Yeah, all right. All right, if I remember correctly, I could be wrong
02:09:55 Let's let's get going. Let's go before you do the voicemail. I need to get some oh my god

02:14:45 You want to be you want to be putting yourself as far away from that as possible? Yeah
02:14:51 Next next one is called, uh
02:14:55 Fuck wait
02:14:57 It's on the other page. I gotta look at what the other page is. Uh, it's called
02:15:01 Uh
02:15:04 Eat trash die fast. Oh three two one go
02:15:10 So if you died right now or wherever you spend the most time, how long do you think it would take for people to find you?
02:15:16 Uh, yeah, my my roommate aka my dad is here. So he would find me
02:15:21 I think it would take I think it would take a few days. I think that
02:15:25 Nobody would come into my room
02:15:28 I mean
02:15:30 No, I think it would probably take probably munchie and kazzie would would would get suspicious
02:15:37 About where I am because like, uh, we're supposed to we're supposed to lift
02:15:41 Don't don't you have don't you have roommates or like
02:15:44 Apartment mates?
02:15:46 Well, they wouldn't well, they wouldn't come into my room. They wouldn't they like I said before like we don't like interact with each other
02:15:51 Oh, okay. Uh, so so they would not come looking for me unless like it started to smell
02:15:56 Unless my body started to now they just think that was a classic ben saint move
02:16:01 Uh
02:16:03 Gotcha
02:16:05 If I can be like if I can be more specific, I think it would take like an hour
02:16:10 For my dad to know if I was dead
02:16:14 Uh
02:16:15 Geez, no, look at me. Look at me
02:16:17 People care about me enough that they'd find out I was dead within less than a day
02:16:22 Yeah, I wouldn't like I mean there's there's both good and bad to that because
02:16:26 The bad part is if my parents died, I would probably kill myself because nobody else cares about me
02:16:31 Sorry tails if this looks emo to the viewers
02:16:34 But uh, I think um, I think in the I think
02:16:40 It would be less it would be less than a week
02:16:42 I think just only because now I have um supposed I'm supposed to lift regularly
02:16:47 And if I started missing my lifting schedule, then people would be like, where is he?
02:16:51 Before that it would have probably taken like a week or more for anyone to be like haven't heard from ben in a while
02:16:56 And there's a weird smell coming out of his room. That's different from the usual one
02:17:00 Hmm
02:17:03 These smells are a bit different from the normal smells
02:17:06 I think before
02:17:08 I think if it were like, okay in my old house
02:17:12 It might maybe would have taken like a week for anyone to be like suspect something. I think here
02:17:18 And except for that my my new schedule if I were on my old schedule here, it could be like a month or more because like
02:17:26 Nobody would expect me to be anywhere
02:17:28 None of my roommates would be like wondering where I am
02:17:32 They would be yeah, I would be here indefinitely
02:17:36 But not would you would you skeletonize?
02:17:39 I think so. Yeah, I think I if if possible. I would attempt to skeletonize
02:17:43 Legend has it if you die and skeletonized come through the window if you die and skeletonized before somebody finds you
02:17:49 You get to be live life as a skeleton. You come back to life
02:17:54 Oh, that would be so awesome
02:17:55 You really want to make sure you die in a in a draw in a hot dry place
02:18:00 You really want to get that uh that process uh started. Oh, just just move to arizona where I live and you'll die pretty fast
02:18:09 Just in general pretty fast
02:18:11 Yeah
02:18:12 based
02:18:14 Uh next voicemail next voicemail is called
02:18:18 Uh, ben saint scaring me three two one go
02:18:24 Ben i'm not gonna lie. It's pretty uncomfortable going on twitter every day to see
02:18:28 You tweeting about trixie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like her just as much as you do at least anymore, but
02:18:36 I'm feeling comfortable. It's pretty disturbing. I'm not gonna lie. It's disturbing. Oh, I'm disturbed
02:18:41 Oh, that's so crazy like oh
02:18:44 What am I even watching right now? What am I even looking at? What is your fucking problem, dude? Take your fucking meds. Okay
02:18:51 It's a meme
02:18:53 What yeah, it's so weird. It's so fucking weird, dude. Like if you think that is weird, I don't
02:19:00 I don't know how you deal. I don't know how you deal with life. You're not gonna be ready when life attacks. Okay
02:19:07 You're a nothing master is what you are
02:19:10 Uh
02:19:11 It's weird because it's like I have to say maybe they're thinking oh
02:19:15 Other youtubers and like brand twitter accounts don't like talk about petty things
02:19:22 But you've been doing this for so long. They surely should understand. This is the ben saint way. I fucking do
02:19:30 Um
02:19:31 I don't know. It's just yeah. Why now see I was just thinking about this like other like people people were complaining at me
02:19:37 Then like ben you're too salty ben. You're too you're too mad you'd live in in your head rent free
02:19:42 But it's it's gotten like it's gotten to the point where I think
02:19:46 People have just accepted it now
02:19:48 And it's just and and most people are just like yeah, that's just been you know like yeah, that's just normal whatever
02:19:53 And I was thinking like I made it. I broke through to the other side
02:19:56 I've brought everyone along with me to a new world where I can be as petty as I want to
02:20:01 And everyone is just fine with it
02:20:03 But this guy's a fucking hold out this guy's a part of the old world and it has to be destroyed to make room for the new
02:20:10 Well, I don't think it's good, but I just don't care to do anything about it anymore
02:20:15 I know I know I've just exhausted you. I've just exhausted you to the point that you it's you can't criticize me anymore
02:20:21 I can't believe I'm on a podcast with ben sane known tweeter. I know
02:20:26 I know
02:20:27 So embarrassing same
02:20:29 You're telling me
02:20:30 true
02:20:31 Yeah, it's hard to it's it's hard to be a brand manager because like you want to like start arguing with people
02:20:37 But that's not professional, but ben doesn't care. He's just like, you know, fuck it. We were saying
02:20:42 Okay, we were saying people were talking about uh, like nate
02:20:46 In like nate's approach to the tricksy thing is like when people have asked him about like cantonate is like so
02:20:53 averse to conflict that he goes like
02:20:56 Eh, these things happen. Eh, it's nobody's fault. Eh, the project just died no one to blame and it's like
02:21:03 No
02:21:04 Everybody knows it's so strange that tricksy killed it by move. It's so like it's it's so obvious that like it's like
02:21:11 It's like you think that like it will automatically look bad if you say anything negative about anyone
02:21:17 But like no if someone does something bad
02:21:20 The right like the normal thing to do is be like, yeah that person fucked up
02:21:23 And if it's true like as long as you're not like making that accusation baselessly like it's it's it's fine
02:21:30 And it's good to say that and it's weird not to it's like I think what could possibly be like
02:21:35 Oh, he doesn't want to burn the bridge with tricksy. I don't think that's it. I think it's oh if people see that
02:21:41 I have emotions and I get angry at stuff. Maybe I'd be angry at other things and it's like
02:21:47 Sponsors won't want to interact with him if they see that he is like upset that
02:21:52 His former partner fucking bailed on him and like wrecked their thing together
02:21:57 Like if they saw that like that bothered him, they'd be like, well, I don't want to work with this guy
02:22:02 This guy's a loose cannon. It's one thing to just like not talk about it because I I guess it's your business
02:22:07 But if somebody asks a question and you answer it with
02:22:09 Hey, what whatever no no harm done
02:22:13 It's like that's that's that's a strange thing. Why would you answer it if you're gonna do that?
02:22:18 It's just the way just the way the cookie crumbles. It's nobody's fault. It's just it's just destiny
02:22:22 I guess I don't know. It's just like that a joker meme where it's like you think tricksy killed the thing
02:22:29 I I do and I'm tired of pretending she didn't
02:22:32 You know, oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
02:22:36 Fucking the rv situation whatever we all know we all know about the rv situation
02:22:42 Uh, the next one is called I sort I sort of know but I don't you can get into it later
02:22:48 It doesn't dad about the book the next one is called tarpitt
02:22:52 trandor thaw
02:22:53 three two one go
02:22:56 Fast-talking craftsmen and indestructible super god tarpuk transom here to mine the past once again
02:23:02 For only its good parts and discard the rest on the last pcp
02:23:07 So like two weeks ago by the time that you hear this you talked about fertility statues made by like cavemen types
02:23:13 And you remembered it as basically porn
02:23:15 Well, I heard that as a kid too, but a while back some female archaeologists slash anthropologists slash whatever
02:23:22 Notice that it's what you see if you're pregnant and you look down
02:23:26 That's right. It is a sculpture made from the first person perspective and holy shit if that is not a cool as fuck idea
02:23:36 Innovation how is it what if cavemen just had pregnancy fetishes? Okay, just because someone said it doesn't mean it's true
02:23:44 Yeah, I mean it's still hot either way look down like pov
02:23:48 statue
02:23:51 Like surely surely a pregnant woman
02:23:54 If she's making statues can look at other pregnant women and know what that looks like and then make a little
02:24:00 Chubby short statue is like this is what it likes. It looks like to be
02:24:05 Fertile pregnant babies come out
02:24:09 Gross, what do you know? That's hot
02:24:14 Mmm
02:24:17 The I mean maybe I mean
02:24:20 Obviously, I mean, yeah, obviously what it is and what it was used for is like it's anyone's guess who knows
02:24:26 Who fucking knows I I didn't really think it was probably our competing barrier. It's it's potentially
02:24:32 I mean, I've heard people say it and I think it's it's just sort of like it doesn't it doesn't sound that crazy
02:24:37 Like I don't know whether I mentioned it at the time, but I always thought it was like
02:24:42 Similar to any other statue. They would do is just like art is
02:24:47 Observing the stuff around them. They draw the story of when they killed the mammoth on the wall in the cave
02:24:53 I mean, they make a little fertile. Why wouldn't it be born? Why wouldn't it be born?
02:24:58 Because they'd be actually fucking I don't know. I don't I don't see any reason why
02:25:02 I don't see I don't see any reason why it couldn't be born
02:25:05 Well, I didn't say it couldn't be born, but I feel like it's it's not as I don't know if they were that horny
02:25:11 Then in in terms of like being repressed and what are you fucking talking about?
02:25:15 They would just fuck they were insane. They wouldn't like spend time spend time making a statue. Oh, that's psychotic
02:25:21 That's crazy. That's that's what you mean. What do you mean? That's insane. No, no, no, you you you you you you missin you
02:25:26 Misinterpreted what she was saying. She was like
02:25:29 They don't need to make porn because they can just fuck whenever they want
02:25:33 That's what you said. Yeah
02:25:35 Makes sense. I'm just no it's that's insane. What's you're crazy? What are you talking about?
02:25:40 What do you mean? You think what do you think human?
02:25:44 What do you that you think that like a civilized society
02:25:47 Humans are just like going and like grabbing people and fucking no and they're just like, yeah, okay
02:25:52 Just living like fucking like orangutans. Yeah, just like just oh just the the unflans just just swinging around the boreal range and forcing copulation
02:26:00 Well, that's what you're describing is inhuman
02:26:04 Isn't didn't they make those statues and like caveman times and shit?
02:26:08 They didn't need porn because they would just say they didn't need it and it's impossible
02:26:13 I'm just saying it feels more likely that there's just like
02:26:16 statues of stuff
02:26:18 Like they would make art about things about life
02:26:22 I yes of
02:26:24 Yes, but sex is a part of life and like yeah, I know sorry, but like when you're when you're when you're
02:26:30 Can do you not like the urge there?
02:26:32 Like when you figure out like ah, I can craft I can craft the likenesses of things
02:26:38 Like obviously there is a a demand there and there is like an idea there
02:26:42 It's like, huh, I could make something looks sexy and makes me fucking hot
02:26:48 And and we still do it and believe it or not. We still do it to this day
02:26:52 We still craft images that get our fucking rocks off. Yes. I know and I'm pretty sure that impulse was probably there since the beginning of time
02:26:59 I know why were you calling me crazy? It's not like I disagree with any of that
02:27:04 but
02:27:05 But you said
02:27:06 Because I think that the thing about like oh, they they didn't need porn as much because they could just have sex
02:27:12 I don't know what that means. That sounds that's because all right. What I was getting at with that totally
02:27:17 point
02:27:18 was that as society became more civilized and cities and stuff
02:27:24 from like small tribes
02:27:27 To like giant cities people became more detached from each other
02:27:33 and so porn became more like
02:27:36 prevalent
02:27:37 And necessary because you I don't know
02:27:42 That's just a hunch. I'm I'm trying to like I think think about like
02:27:46 I think it's victorian england that there would be a lot of porn
02:27:51 I think that in any era
02:27:54 Any era at all of human civilization
02:27:57 there would have been
02:27:58 men
02:28:00 who wanted
02:28:01 Who who were who were not men men who were seeking sexual gratification and were not able to find it
02:28:07 immediately
02:28:09 I feel like that's like going to be a universal thing throughout all. Okay. I just I just think it may have been
02:28:16 like
02:28:17 Like if it was a graph, I think the thing would have gone up
02:28:22 In in more like city
02:28:24 Like you you think you think that you think that like uh, uh, uh, what uh, what's the word? Um
02:28:31 Unfulfillment sexual unfulfillment would go up. Yeah with the rise of urbanism. Yeah
02:28:37 Well, I mean, I'm thinking like not even just that but like this the in england in victoria
02:28:43 I'm just thinking of victorian england is like
02:28:47 There was a lot of like oh, you're not proper unless
02:28:51 unless you like
02:28:53 Like don't masturbate ever and like sexual repression became extremely fashionable
02:28:59 And and I don't know religions and stuff
02:29:02 Back in the caveman times. They didn't have as much of that or at least, you know, there was a time before it
02:29:09 I don't know sure
02:29:11 They might not have had
02:29:12 Puritanism is like an ideology
02:29:16 Uh, okay. I mean, I guess I see what you mean, but I still don't agree with it
02:29:21 Yeah, I mean, I'm not basing it off of anything. It was just a like a general hunch thing
02:29:27 Okay, I think we've made some great progress today
02:29:32 All I'm saying
02:29:33 All I'm saying is I'm not crazy. Okay, it's what you it's what you it's what you see when you look down and you're pregnant
02:29:40 Whatever, okay
02:29:43 Sure, where's the where's the ancient fertility dildos if that's if that's you know what if that's what you see
02:29:48 If that's what you see when you look at the statue, that's just as valid as anything else
02:29:52 You know what if they were if they were really horny. Why didn't they make like uh
02:29:56 Flesh lights meaning out of rocks and shit
02:29:59 You know, I heard someone told me
02:30:02 I don't remember who told me this but recently someone told me that they discovered an ancient egyptian vibrator
02:30:08 nice and
02:30:10 What it was it's you're not gonna believe this. This is what they told me
02:30:13 I don't know if it's true. This is just what I was told
02:30:14 But the way that it worked was it was a hollow tube into which you would insert live bees
02:30:24 Inside them the hollow tube and that was what caused the vibration. No, I just heard this. I just heard this
02:30:30 No, it's funny enough to be true
02:30:33 See, all right
02:30:35 There's another thing about all of this is that the the the sexual nature of a lot of
02:30:40 Archaeological finds that were presented in english
02:30:45 um at the time of of like
02:30:48 The industrial revolution and areas around them is like, oh
02:30:52 So barbaric, we can't let them we can't let people know that there were statues of penises and stuff
02:30:59 there's like famous um
02:31:01 Of like a like a a carving of a pharaoh with his wang out and he's got an erection
02:31:07 And in the british museum, they chopped that off
02:31:11 They just chopped that part off and so that so so the people couldn't get like so ladies wouldn't faint
02:31:16 They wouldn't get a case of the veins. That was can't can't cancel culture gone too far. Yeah
02:31:21 They circumcised him. Yeah, and so like I'm not sure how much of like the education
02:31:26 of history
02:31:28 In that way continues
02:31:30 So maybe I grew up not knowing enough about how horny everyone was
02:31:37 Okay, I mean I mean I think
02:31:40 the the I'm gonna say that the
02:31:44 The the gatekeeping the gatekeeping of sex
02:31:48 I believe is is probably a part of human society
02:31:53 Even even even in caveman days like even in caveman days you like before there was any civilization whatsoever
02:31:59 You would have had like, you know
02:32:02 You would have had like try, you know families that live together that wouldn't just want like, you know
02:32:06 Fucking roving some fucking roving like, you know, vagrant like wandering
02:32:11 But yeah wandering by and just like like raping the raping
02:32:16 Like no, like no, I'll fuck I'll fucking kill you if you come near my fucking family you fucking scavenger
02:32:21 Did they do that in the bible?
02:32:24 Oh, no, they they sold their daughters into sex slavery. That's what they did in the bible
02:32:28 Yeah, for a few loaves. That's whatever everyone it was. It was the hottest thing
02:32:33 It was like the hot new thing to do. I'm not proud of it
02:32:35 But you know peer pressure kind of at the time it it just seemed right. It just seemed cool. Everyone was doing it
02:32:42 I don't I don't like doing it, but it works
02:32:46 Didn't want to be cringe
02:32:48 You know, you got a hand at two of them though. It really works. It gets results. Yeah
02:32:55 Uh next voicemail next voicemail is called. Okay. There's an image and a video
02:33:01 Attached it's about cuneiform. It's making it's writing with the cuneiform clay tablet. Okay three two one go
02:33:10 On the topic of old stuff, I've been thinking about how cuneiform was used for writing for like 3 000 years
02:33:15 So it's longevity far outstrips any other way to write anything
02:33:20 Uh and then I looked in would further and I found two things a holy shit is it ever small like goddamn
02:33:27 And b nothing I've ever seen
02:33:30 In depictions has really captured the three dimensionality that it has how important the shadows are for being able to read it
02:33:37 And what the shapes actually look like in person. Yeah
02:33:42 The picture that I included is of a tablet for scale
02:33:45 And the number file video of it that if that goes through
02:33:49 Will show around the three minute mark what the shapes really look like. Uh, I just
02:33:54 Appreciate how its literal durability has allowed it to endure with perfect legibility
02:33:59 And uh, I thought that was cool and wanted to share this is well
02:34:02 I mean, that's why we still talk about it is because it happens to be the writing form that is best preserved
02:34:08 I really like this tiny fucking iphone
02:34:13 It's so cute with the little squishes like you squish the little things into the clay
02:34:17 But it's an iphone remember like
02:34:20 tiny little
02:34:22 I want a cuneiform phone. It is really small
02:34:25 Uh, yeah, I've seen like when you when you when you see it written out like on paper like black ink on white paper like it doesn't look
02:34:33 I mean it looks different obviously
02:34:35 I don't know not knowing much about it. I have no fucking clue what i'm talking about
02:34:39 Oh, it's like cave paintings where I mean it looks kind of cool. It's I like how it looks
02:34:44 It's like in certain cave paintings where um under like a torch
02:34:49 I mean a flashlight a flashlight would um, it wouldn't work
02:34:54 You'd just look at it and be like that doesn't look good
02:34:56 But with a torch light and you move the torch around the fire the flames they flicker and they make it look like it's a moving
02:35:03 image
02:35:09 It's it's it was it was like uh, it was like, uh, it was like a video I watched about it told me that
02:35:17 I don't really know
02:35:19 They said it was like the primitive animation like that sounds incredible
02:35:23 But I don't I don't get it wait primitive animation. Oh like like the flickering flickering of the torch would make the thing look like it's moving
02:35:31 But only with fire you can't like shine like a bright led light on it
02:35:37 And as some guy figured that out when he realized that why they wouldn't have fucking led spotlights. What am I doing? He turned them off
02:35:47 And then he turned on he he lit a torch and he was like, oh my god, they're dancing
02:35:51 They're dancing
02:35:54 Amazing
02:35:57 I'm sure it looked very cool back in the day
02:36:01 Lit by uh by camp firelight or whatever
02:36:04 Uh next voicemail is called

02:38:20 No, not right before el salvador
02:38:23 Gardening house and let me tell you
02:38:28 It was not the most uh, wisest decisions because I lost nearly 20 percentage of my investments
02:38:34 So when there'd be occasions to not to follow my example
02:38:39 Yes, do not do
02:38:41 What we do and check out this video by the grivel institute. Uh, it might it might educate you a little bit
02:38:48 On your if you bought it like a week ago, then yeah, I'm really sorry
02:38:51 You owned it when it went over that cliff when fucking el salvador adopted it
02:38:55 I don't know why that like it hurt the price so much, but it sure did
02:39:00 It's 20% though. Uh, yeah, I can't speculate on why I think it's just sort of something
02:39:07 It's a new thing happened. Oh, everyone did do something and they did
02:39:12 A new thing happens and yeah, yeah, everyone do something
02:39:15 It's like musical chairs just like find a chair buy sell
02:39:18 I don't know just do something and then like people see what where the trends are going
02:39:22 They follow the trend and then the trend becomes a huge thing
02:39:25 And it went down. Oh my god, Elon Musk made a made a tweet everybody find a chair
02:39:29 Everyone find either a red chair to sell or a green chair to buy. Oh, everyone's sitting in red. Uh, well price goes down
02:39:35 Okay

02:40:00 But as fate would have it
02:40:03 It's even worse
02:40:06 Why?
02:40:07 So, yeah, just
02:40:09 I you cut your losses and made a worse decision
02:40:14 I guess it fell cut his losses sold his other crypto
02:40:18 Yeah, well, it's it's not cutting your losses if then you buy some more of a different crypto
02:40:24 I think i'm out of the crypto
02:40:26 Buying for for now unless I see some like really compelling evidence to like. Oh, no, it's it's gotta go
02:40:32 It's gotta go really far down from for me to get interested again
02:40:36 I've made my small profit and i'm good to sit on that forever
02:40:43 Man, I don't know if
02:40:45 People people are still saying it's going to 100 by the end of the year and I don't know that's just hopeful
02:40:50 They just want that to happen because they're invested in it
02:40:54 There's only like I want it to go to minus 100 by the end of the year so I can invest again true true
02:41:01 Uh next voicemail is called, uh
02:41:06 Yiga Yiga gazers three two one go

02:41:53 Next voicemail is called next voicemail is called big guy three two one go
02:42:01 Hey, then can I drop in our of your ocs? No
02:42:06 Oh
02:42:08 This is a reference to the fact that I told
02:42:11 I saw an artist asking another artist like oh your oc is cute
02:42:15 Can I draw them and I and I I said
02:42:18 You don't you don't have to ask them
02:42:20 You don't have to ask for permission
02:42:22 And they and they were like i'm doing it to be courteous and respectful
02:42:26 And I was like that's dumb
02:42:29 It's it's courteous. It's not discourteous and it's not disrespectful. In fact personally
02:42:34 I find it annoying when someone would ask me. Oh, can I draw your oc? You know, it's even worse than that
02:42:40 Yeah
02:42:41 People ask me for permission to make tails gets trolled like fan art
02:42:45 And it's like first of all, I didn't even make tails gets trolled is
02:42:48 Felsichold is fucking fan art. You fucking imbecile actually fucking claude actually. No, it isn't it's it's above fan art
02:42:55 It's even more sophisticated than fan
02:42:58 But uh, I see the thing is I didn't even make tails gets trolled
02:43:02 And even if I did like you can do whatever you want. So it's like
02:43:06 I don't you can literally do
02:43:08 Whatever you want. Yeah, you do whatever you fucking want
02:43:11 Uh, this person got all defensive and blocked me
02:43:15 They said they said I was uh, they said I was uh, they said like don't speak for another artist
02:43:20 It's like I didn't I just said it would annoy me
02:43:22 It would annoy me if someone asked me can I draw your oc's because yeah, of course you can
02:43:27 I didn't speak for anyone else
02:43:28 She got mad and she blocked me and then everyone in my discord
02:43:31 Everyone in my discord had a fucking fit sporktown harrowin had had one of her fucking psychotic episodes
02:43:38 And uh and got everyone to uh to dog pile on me
02:43:42 So, you know very funny very very good. Ha ha we all had a good laugh
02:43:47 Uh, and that's what this is about. So there's context damn
02:43:53 I know right next voicemail is called
02:43:57 Wait, was that was that yiga gazers we just listened to yes
02:44:01 I think what no no that was
02:44:04 No, um
02:44:07 It wasn't uh, was it yiga gazers was the one before
02:44:12 So that's me that was that was big guy. Yeah
02:44:16 I think I might have switched those names around
02:44:19 But like who cares whatever um next voicemail is called
02:44:25 All
02:44:28 Nate on the podcast three two one go
02:44:34 You talked about how
02:44:35 Nate doesn't want to be on the podcast because he doesn't want to talk about himself as much as you know
02:44:40 Random topics and I think you misinterpreted what you know you're wrong and ignoring the possibility that Nate just doesn't want to be on
02:44:47 The podcast because it opens him up to criticism
02:44:50 um
02:44:52 I think what he really meant is that the current focus of the episodes are normally what's been going on in my life
02:44:58 And you know what's been going on in my head the past week. What have I been thinking about whereas the
02:45:04 Topics often encouraged talking about yourself. Yes, but talking about your opinions on other things
02:45:11 Talking about your deplore backstories as a content creator
02:45:15 um things that audiences would be interested in
02:45:19 um
02:45:20 Viewing the podcast as part of your repertoire of personality driven
02:45:26 Okay, all right. Okay, buddy. What this person is talking about with across to you are giving that
02:45:32 You are giving Nate way too much credit
02:45:34 You have thought this through way more than he did the fact is that when I ask him
02:45:38 Why he doesn't want to be on the the show and he says because I don't want to talk about topics
02:45:42 That doesn't make any sense and it's nonsense and he doesn't know what it means either
02:45:46 So like you're you're giving me you're giving you're like you thought it like no
02:45:50 Here's like here's this like actually what it must mean is this like oh and if I if I connect these dots together
02:45:55 It's because oh it's actually because his interest must lie in this other place
02:45:58 And it's it actually conflicts with like his core philosophy of this. It's like no, it's just nonsense
02:46:04 It's just nonsense. Didn't um
02:46:06 Didn't he talk about himself or like stuff he was doing on the gamer zone?
02:46:12 Of course, what would you what would any what is any podcast?
02:46:15 What do you talk about in any podcast you talk about yourself what you're doing?
02:46:19 And and what's up?
02:46:22 What is any podcast?
02:46:24 Yeah, so it's just nonsense guy. Just just don't think about it anymore. It's not it's it's there's nothing to think about
02:46:32 Uh
02:46:33 Next voicemail is called ben bullying
02:46:37 Nice hold on. I will post it right there
02:46:41 Yeah, there it is. Okay, three two one go
02:46:44 This is a message for past ben
02:46:47 It is
02:46:48 9 11 at 12 24
02:46:52 And there's no episode of the pcp
02:46:55 And fuck you ben. It's not my fault. It's game's fault. Gotcha
02:47:04 Uh
02:47:05 Sorry for the late episode, but like, you know, whatever it was like 10 hours late like oh, sorry
02:47:12 Why why was it late?
02:47:14 Oh, I I I uploaded it wrong and then I was away from my computer for a long time and I didn't notice
02:47:21 I didn't schedule it to upload. I I just put it up unlisted. Yeah
02:47:26 Because I just forgot to hit the schedule button because of internet problems
02:47:29 Uh, yes, but it wasn't exactly I was moving
02:47:34 Okay
02:47:37 Uh, okay, the next one is an image link. So I will put that uh right here
02:47:44 Horseshoe versus dr. Wolf. Let's go. Okay. Here we go
02:47:49 All right
02:47:49 The virgin in horseshoes didn't credit munchie for the pony avatar gets mad about inconsequential things is yellow
02:47:56 But we'll deny it the chad wolf assembled huge teams of unpaid volunteers features an equestria girl's dvd art
02:48:04 proudly white
02:48:08 Is that second one was he an equestria girl's dvd art?
02:48:12 No, I like how we don't question like, oh, of course. He's proudly white, but no
02:48:15 But the equation is probably well, I mean look at him. You look at him. He's white. You can see it
02:48:20 I mean, he's kind of gray. He's kind of gray, but like this is a good picture. Wish there were more blurbs
02:48:26 Only three eight. Yeah, come on. We can think of three is
02:48:29 There's there's wasted space. Yeah
02:48:32 Uh, hold on. I would say dr. Wolf. All right. I found a video of dr. Wolf himself reacting to it
02:48:40 Wait
02:48:41 Okay. Yeah. Yeah
02:48:43 Oh, okay. So the the box art people
02:48:47 Did they put a screenshot of a dr. Wolf video talking about equestria girls on the back of an actual dvd?
02:48:54 What what the fuck? What a terrible
02:48:57 That's awesome. Why would they do that?
02:49:00 That's insane. That's so bad
02:49:04 I guess the person doing the design just didn't give a shit the person who made it probably just thought it was from the show
02:49:09 And didn't know that happens actually a lot
02:49:15 Weird it's probably like looked it up dr. Wolf's thumbnail or something or uh
02:49:20 Clip from his uh from his show was like one of the first results and they were just like, ah, here we go
02:49:25 Oh
02:49:26 How bizarre but yeah, wow there is
02:49:31 Yeah, horseshoe or there be yeah horseshoe horseshoe never got on dvd box. Hey, where's the dvd is tricksy
02:49:38 Where's the blue rays? Then we could then we could have had it then maybe there'd be a uh a conversation to be had
02:49:44 Lamal, uh, no
02:49:47 I mean, I guess Chad Wolf wins
02:49:50 There's just no contest. So okay easy
02:49:53 Uh uh
02:49:56 Next one is called
02:49:58 Oh
02:50:04 There he is
02:50:07 My man. Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. Okay. It's like that fucking
02:50:14 It's like that picture monkey tweeted once where he added like some dumb character to the simpsons lineup and pretended it was real
02:50:21 Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Gumbly. He didn't he didn't he didn't uh invent that. He got it from like he got it from 4chan
02:50:29 But it's exactly like that
02:50:34 I didn't need to stop looking at this. Oh, oh, you mean dr. Wolf in that screen. Yeah
02:50:39 Yeah, like why would there be a little anthropomorphic wolf? Don't they know that the whole premise is that everyone is a human?
02:50:45 Didn't they watch the movie?
02:50:47 Well spike is a dog. I don't know
02:50:50 Oh, shit, you're right
02:50:53 There's dog. I can't believe this is real

02:52:06 Muchi wears tiny hats and then we get and then I would force them all to come back on the podcast
02:52:11 They need to be more specific
02:52:14 They need to be more specific about this question. Like is there a like a
02:52:17 distance limit to
02:52:20 How you can like control like mind control people or can you just like mind control anyone from anywhere?
02:52:25 I like to treat it as a blanket. So it's like risk. It's it sounds like you can just pick five people
02:52:31 That's that's sort of how the death networks because you know how you can like write make people do stuff before you kill them
02:52:38 Of course
02:52:39 sort of like that
02:52:40 I would get all of my favorite
02:52:42 Artists to read and enjoy my comics and say good job. That's what I hear here
02:52:50 Here's my answer. I would uh mind control joe biden to legalize weed
02:52:54 That's perfect
02:52:57 Yeah, I would I would I would control I would mind control joe biden to enforce a
02:53:02 vaccination mandates. Oh
02:53:04 Wait, I it looks like I did it looks like
02:53:08 No need anymore
02:53:09 What a coincidence. I thought you're gonna say mandate people to watch my little pony
02:53:15 Well gen five is you don't know me very well. Do you then? I guess I guess not
02:53:23 No, it would make them make them read homestuck if anything. Oh, yeah, that's true
02:53:28 Yeah
02:53:29 That's that's the only way. Well, I'll make Joe Biden read homestuck and talk about homestuck at length on one of his speeches
02:53:35 At like 0.5 percent speed
02:53:38 Oh, yeah, and instead of his state of the union address. It's the homestuck address
02:53:43 He addresses he addresses he'll talk about his favorite state of the state of the fandom state of the fandom
02:53:50 Uh, yeah
02:53:52 Next voicemail is called a message from your gaping ass three two one go
02:53:59 Oh
02:54:02 Hey, Ben just sitting here in the mcdonald's drive-thru and I was just wondering do you point on doing
02:54:10 A physical release of slime and pushman because if you are that would be based
02:54:15 Yeah, I'm yeah, I've definitely said it before I'm definitely gonna do a book when when
02:54:20 Slime and when the when the game is done and I finish the comic. Yeah, I'm gonna
02:54:24 Uh, I'm going to
02:54:26 Yeah, I'm gonna do I'm gonna do like a like a homestuck book is is the idea
02:54:31 It's gonna be like, you know for four panels of page and like commentary on the bottom
02:54:35 I think is what I'm gonna do. I already started laying pages out actually actually I laid them out a long time ago
02:54:41 Uh
02:54:42 You know up up to what I had done at the time
02:54:45 You know, I need to uh go back and uh complete that obviously
02:54:49 So, yeah, short answer is yes
02:54:52 And it will be like and it will be because it'll be it's many many more pages than the vapors
02:54:56 So it would need like a an actual like, you know, perfect bound, uh, like soft
02:55:02 Softcovered book not like a not like a saddle stitched, uh, you know
02:55:09 Copy a comic whatever you call it
02:55:13 Uh, yep
02:55:15 Next voicemail is called a message from your gaping ass two three two one go
02:55:21 Hey, I also want to say
02:55:24 Uh, turns out you're actually the soy lord, uh stopping. So god damn soy already. I don't even fucking I don't even like soy
02:55:33 I like uh, I like almond milk and I like coconut milk. I don't like soy soy soy
02:55:38 Oh, no, never mind never mind the soy programming is activated soy soy soy
02:55:43 You at one time I tasted it was enough
02:55:46 Now I I was wrong. I was wrong about that soy is good
02:55:50 Uh, uh, yeah guys actually soy doesn't turn you into a girl
02:55:55 Actually, soy doesn't have phytoestrogens
02:55:58 The watch the h-bomber guy video where he says that soy actually won't mind control you and turn you into a live
02:56:05 Hey, that's that's that's what I want. Yes. I want everyone to see that
02:56:09 I want everyone to think it's good for you actually
02:56:11 I really wish it was as easy as eating like a different or drinking a different kind of milk or whatever
02:56:17 But yeah
02:56:20 Eating them eating the miracle burger because why why would you get on hrt if you just eat soy all the time? Yeah
02:56:26 Soy soy soy
02:56:29 Hell if it was that easy, I would do it too
02:56:32 Soy if it were if it were you gotta eat the miracle burger. It's got like 100 times the estrogen
02:56:39 Oh, you mean the uh impossible burger from burger king. That's the one. Yes. Yes the impossible burger
02:56:45 Lamel
02:56:47 Also the 5g signals
02:56:50 Someone in a burger
02:56:52 Someone in a restaurant. We were I was joking about like, uh, you know vaccine conspiracies and a guy at the table over
02:56:59 from us, he he chimed in to say something about like
02:57:03 5g and and like vaccines and stuff and like, uh, uh, like, you know, uh
02:57:10 heavy metal particles or something and and
02:57:13 Okay, the the point is
02:57:15 He chimed in and I genuinely could not tell if he was like saying like ha ha
02:57:21 Actually, there is some truth to the coveted like the vaccines are poison thing
02:57:25 Or if he was like chiming in to like make a joke along with us like ha ha. Yeah, that's so funny
02:57:31 You should check this stuff out. It's funny too
02:57:33 I genuinely could not figure out which one it was and it made me very uncomfortable because I was like
02:57:38 I don't want to laugh and I don't want to engage with this guy on the chance that he is being serious
02:57:43 But I don't want to shun him and make him feel bad on the chance that he is just trying to have a goof with me
02:57:49 And I and I was I was really I was really caught between a lot of rock and a hard place on that one
02:57:53 That's quite a conundrum. I know
02:57:56 I kind of just had to sort of thread the needle and be like ha ha like act like I was amused but not too amused
02:58:03 You know
02:58:04 Yeah, that was my solution
02:58:07 Um, I know that feel
02:58:11 Next voicemail is uh a message from your gaping ass three
02:58:18 Three two one go
02:58:21 Okay, here's my true thoughts about benjamin sing
02:58:25 Uh, he is hilarious
02:58:28 Absolutely funny. I love him true god here in terms of humor
02:58:33 But god damn how I want to strangle him sometimes with his fucking lefty opinions
02:58:38 It actually hurts me, but like it's funny. So I don't care. I can't tell if this is like a parody. I don't care, but uh
02:58:49 Cool, man, have a nice day. Thanks for the email. Is he what was the last bit? I think he said he's floundering or something

02:59:30 Jenny Nicholson got a million v's talking about bronies
02:59:33 You could do it too if you talked about your time in the fandom
02:59:36 The history of it all the stupid things that happen in all the freaks
02:59:39 You meant like brony curious and cake standard cake, especially as a gold nugget that needs to be mine
02:59:45 Call the video the truth about bronies or the dark side of the brony phantom
02:59:49 Anywho, I need to get back to picking apples fucking apples you idiot

03:00:15 Oh, yes, I could wear the blue wear the blue of spray painted blue horse head the wear the hooves
03:00:21 Uh, yeah, it's not I might it might be worth doing because I mean there is a there is kind of a funny story there

03:01:10 You know phantom horn, uh, it doesn't fetishize them like that phantom horn would never mix races in such a problematic way
03:01:17 Uh
03:01:19 None of that please
03:01:22 Next one is called, uh dick punisher
03:01:25 Three two one go

03:01:48 I mean
03:01:50 Everyone calls me ben
03:01:52 The only person who I okay, honestly, I I used to always call munchie munchie. Sometimes I still do sometimes I call him anthony now
03:02:01 Uh, it's so I guess it's kind of
03:02:05 Munchie and kazzie I go half and half with like I sometimes call them
03:02:09 The one name and I sometimes call them the other gib. I always call gib. I never I never call you louis
03:02:15 Uh, I never have
03:02:18 It's on your patreon. I know
03:02:20 But most people don't think about it
03:02:22 I only use my real name for like my friends
03:02:26 Or people people people that I've people like that. I know really well for most people like, uh
03:02:33 Um, most people I meet online. I just use their online names
03:02:37 Unless I've known them for a long time
03:02:40 There was there was a a phase my my discord server went through a phase where everybody everybody made their uh, everybody made their
03:02:48 Their discord name their real name for a minute there. I thought it was their middle. I think there's some people was yeah
03:02:53 Some people it was their middle names
03:02:56 uh
03:02:58 So, but uh, I don't know
03:03:01 I think it's
03:03:04 Cool and stupid. I think it's good and bad. I don't know what I think about anything
03:03:10 Um
03:03:11 I don't know my screen name is my is my real first name anyway. So it's like, you know
03:03:17 No, no no confusion there would be no reason to like having a podcast
03:03:24 Like name that we just don't refer to each other as that'd be really weird
03:03:30 Yeah, I thought st was your real last name
03:03:33 It is not it is not
03:03:36 A lot of people a lot a lot of people think that and a lot of people have assumed that nate's name is nate saint because
03:03:42 I love that. That's one of my favorites. Yeah
03:03:45 Yeah, that's pretty funny, but it's not it's not true. It's not. Yeah, he took uh, he took their mother's name
03:03:51 That's why are you brothers?
03:03:53 You what do you even?
03:03:55 Yes
03:03:56 You fucking goof wait, wait. Do you tell him what tbap stands for?
03:04:01 Wait, don't you tell him
03:04:04 Tbap stands for two best brothers bitch about ponies. Uh, yes. Yes true. Yes true
03:04:10 But um, I can't I keep for some reason I keep thinking of this
03:04:13 But the whole nate saint thing reminds me of the mario mario luigi mario thing again
03:04:18 You're you're obsessed. You're obsessed with mario mario luigi mario. That's that's like my favorite movie the super mario brothers movie
03:04:26 I had that thing
03:04:27 I had it on vhs as a kid and I remember liking it
03:04:30 But I remember like the like the second half got taped over so I remember the first half really well
03:04:36 And I remember the ending
03:04:38 I remember when like the dimensions merge or whatever. Yeah, and there's a big section in the middle that I just don't remember
03:04:45 Um, we got one final last minute voicemail
03:04:50 Gender abolition extremists in the making
03:04:53 three two one go
03:04:56 Is there anybody whose life is actually improved by
03:05:01 Gender being a factor like compared to if it didn't exist and femininity and masculinity weren't real things
03:05:07 And everybody was just described by individual factors like
03:05:11 At best it feels like a total non factor where you're just you know, like you don't care. You're fine. Just be in yourself
03:05:18 Uh, and at worst it's a completely crippling condition that leaves you socially dejected and hating yourself like
03:05:28 Why isn't everybody on earth just a day then who the fuck came up with this?
03:05:32 Fuck this is what I've been saying. Yeah, it's I mean
03:05:35 gender
03:05:36 I think
03:05:37 But if in terms of like having a gender binary or like oh masculine feminine male female
03:05:43 um
03:05:45 men women uh
03:05:47 The utility is temporary in that people grew up like for me
03:05:52 I I like doing the woman things because it makes me feel better than
03:05:58 Like compensating for having lived as a man for so long
03:06:02 but ideally
03:06:04 That would have never been a living as a man and wanting to live as something else
03:06:09 It would have just been they them from the beginning
03:06:12 Yeah, that's that's that's kind of how I am like
03:06:16 I don't really like strongly identify as any gender like I've just
03:06:20 People think I look like a man. So I guess that's when I am out of convenience, but I I
03:06:27 I don't really care either way
03:06:29 I strongly feel that uh the like the the existence of gender like the the convention of gendered pronouns is just a very unfortunate sort of like linguistic
03:06:39 accident
03:06:40 That we didn't really need it didn't need to be that way
03:06:44 And it's it's unfortunate in that it like
03:06:47 Causes all this fucking all this fucking strife and confusion and all apparently
03:06:51 I wish we just didn't have it and then and then there would just there would be no
03:06:55 There would be so much we wouldn't even have to debate it apparently. It's like even worse in other languages besides english
03:07:02 sure
03:07:03 For us to have genders. I never really understood what that even means. It's it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a bit of
03:07:10 Like over complication that it's like do we I don't think we really get I feel like we don't get that much out of it
03:07:15 I feel like it's a cabinet in
03:07:18 Italian is feminins like why what is it?
03:07:22 How did it make well, I mean in some in I learned this from yon yon misily in some languages. It's like
03:07:29 It's genuinely like completely arbitrary like what vert like what nouns are masculine or what a feminine like like even if it's a person
03:07:37 Like if it's like a certain kind of person like a nephew or or or something like
03:07:41 So something like the word for a nephew can just like be masculine even if it's like a girl nephew, right?
03:07:47 What some languages
03:07:49 Oh, you mean other languages. Yeah, some languages are just completely arbitrary and there is literally like no
03:07:55 It doesn't it's not like oh this is this thing is called female because we have a
03:08:00 Female conception of its use or purpose like no like it's it's literally just like someone picked it at random once
03:08:06 That's like every word real quick. Have you talked to yon misily?
03:08:11 No
03:08:13 Okay, uh
03:08:14 Why would I have talked to yon misily because you just said you did oh you said you watched a video
03:08:19 He's a he's a youtuber. Oh, okay. Yeah. I thought they like I thought they were like on the podcast or something
03:08:24 I watched their um, I watched their mario video the other uh the other day
03:08:29 About how many I found them
03:08:31 I found them through that video and then I went back and I watched all their conlangs
03:08:36 Yeah, I actually I actually found them through uh their rhythm heaven videos because that's one of my other favorite
03:08:41 Uh game series yo cc. I've never played a rhythm heaven video, but I went back and I also watched the rhythm heaven videos
03:08:47 And that was really good. Yeah cc. Did you get the new wario where?
03:08:52 Uh, no not yet. Ah, it's great. I get I I I guess I'll have to uh
03:08:57 I'll have to get it to fill the void in my heart that
03:09:01 A new rhythm heaven game isn't going to be made anytime soon. So
03:09:06 Well, thank you. I'll have to wario's there get that as a substitute
03:09:09 That's right
03:09:12 Hi, at least at least kotake uchi is still doing art. Yeah, I like his I like his style. It's good
03:09:19 Uh, yeah
03:09:20 Great game. How much play?
03:09:23 I've you know, I don't know it you more of a wario land kind of guy
03:09:29 I'm just I'm just you know, I look at the game
03:09:32 Which it's like it's just a bunch of rhythm based mini games and I oh rhythm heaven on I
03:09:37 Yeah, or or or even wario where and I'm just like, I don't know
03:09:40 It seems like
03:09:42 I guess it just doesn't appeal to me as something that I want to do is like sit down and like
03:09:47 I'm not I'm not into like rhythm stuff. It's just like it's so it's so simplistic
03:09:52 I I understand that like why it would be fun. I guess but it's like
03:09:56 Doesn't it I'm not it doesn't call out to me like then you should you're gonna you're gonna get you're gonna get something out
03:10:01 Of this experience like uh
03:10:03 This kind of seems like a distraction
03:10:06 From what's really important well
03:10:08 Which is arguing on twitter which is posting on twitter about how I will pay money for people to unsubscribe from trixie's patreon
03:10:16 I must have my vengeance at any cost. Well, but that's what that's what matters to me right now. This is the real phantoms revenge
03:10:23 Yes, true
03:10:26 it's like uh
03:10:27 Mario's legend of the seven stars or whatever you get you're the shell
03:10:34 And if you time the button presses
03:10:36 correctly
03:10:37 It does extra damage
03:10:41 It's also like extra damage. It's also like mother three if you've ever played that. Oh, yeah, the battle played earthbound
03:10:48 Oh, yeah, the earthbound I have not played mother three
03:10:50 The battle system is sort of like rhythm heaven in mother three also
03:10:55 Yeah, you like time we have to press is to the music
03:10:58 Yeah
03:11:00 fascinating
03:11:02 uh
03:11:04 Is that it?
03:11:06 I really I really like the yon misleys. Uh, he means like three videos or something about rhythm heaven
03:11:13 Yeah, got a lot out of those. Well, if you if you ever get him on the podcast, you should invite me to
03:11:19 Okay, I mean if I ever just happened to stumble upon yon misle
03:11:24 Yeah, you can you can see him walking outside sometimes
03:11:27 If I if I ever just just walking around town and I bump into the guy and I say hey, man
