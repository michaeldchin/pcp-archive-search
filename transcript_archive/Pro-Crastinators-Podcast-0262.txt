00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.
00:00:18 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:28 I'm back. I'm not dead. Tom's back. Tom's back. Tom will never die.
00:00:33 Special guest, Tom Oliver.
00:00:35 It was true what they said. They said you wouldn't die and you didn't. I'm sorry if I got really loud right there. I'm fucking with my audacity volume.
00:00:43 I'm not that affects Discord, so I probably can't hear that at all.
00:00:46 Yeah, you wouldn't hear that, but the audience will have to deal with it.
00:00:50 Well, Eleazar, fix that.
00:00:52 Nah, Eleazar, let them cope. Let them cope and sieve.
00:01:00 So let's wake up those headphone users. Let's give them something to think about.
00:01:04 That I was momentarily loud. Yes. Long time no see. You haven't been on one month. It's got to be like a month now, right?
00:01:12 At least. It's been ridiculous.
00:01:14 What have you possibly been doing that could be more important than our business here?
00:01:20 On The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:01:24 Working on secret projects.
00:01:26 Oh god, not you too.
00:01:28 Dude, we all have secret projects. I saw your secret projects. It's pretty cool.
00:01:32 It's pretty cool. Thank you. It's not secret anymore, I guess.
00:01:36 It's a project. It's just a project now.
00:01:38 Now it's just a project. Now it's just a project.
00:01:40 The mystique is gone, but the glory remains.
00:01:44 Wait, I want to...
00:01:46 Last week, I had five people have beaten the demo.
00:01:52 It was a crack, munchy, shinny, Sean, and Tio.
00:01:58 And one more shining god joined the ranks for a total of six.
00:02:04 Earning the name. Six ascended beings.
00:02:07 And his name was Roboblo. Roboblo has ascended.
00:02:12 Six people. Notable failures to complete the game include Gib and Take, the best guy ever.
00:02:19 And the other, and you know, they're in good company though.
00:02:24 The other seven plus billion human beings on the planet.
00:02:27 Everybody else on the planet, you know?
00:02:28 All embarrassments. All embarrassments.
00:02:31 They're just not willing to put the work in.
00:02:33 It's a test of patience and they fail.
00:02:36 Like any good RPG, it's all about the grind.
00:02:39 And the first step on the grind is to go to patreon.com.
00:02:43 Do you have the will? Do you have the sheer resolve to click?
00:02:48 To type your mom the funny little numbers on the back of your mom's.
00:02:53 It demands a lot of you.
00:02:56 It really is the dark souls of role playing games.
00:02:59 Oh, that's the first hurdle you got to get over.
00:03:02 Only then can the challenge truly begin.
00:03:05 I mean, that sounds ridiculous.
00:03:08 But when you think about it, every video game, the first step is to pay for it.
00:03:12 So really, you're asking nothing more than any other video game developer would.
00:03:19 I guess so. I mean, I mean, I only play free games a lot of the time.
00:03:25 Or I guess that's not true anymore. I guess that's not true anymore.
00:03:28 You've been playing Noida for like,
00:03:30 About 600 hours.
00:03:32 I've clocked about 600 hours in Noida now.
00:03:35 That's insane.
00:03:36 It's fucked up. It's horrible.
00:03:38 I had a run. I had the run the other day.
00:03:43 I finally got to a state where I was immune to everything I needed to be immune to.
00:03:50 And I got a glass cannon, which, among other things, just makes everything you do do way more damage.
00:03:58 And all explosions have like five times their radius.
00:04:01 And then I got nukes.
00:04:03 And I had fire immunity and explosion immunity.
00:04:05 So I was immune to my own nukes.
00:04:07 And my nukes were five times as big.
00:04:09 So I could literally like, I could literally just bomb an entire biome out of existence with a single nuke.
00:04:16 I crashed the game because I nuked the vault so hard that all the dead enemies that died to a single nuke blast just rained gold down on me.
00:04:27 And there was so much gold raining down on me that it crashed the game.
00:04:31 Is that what it feels like to have bought Dogecoin at a fraction of a penny?
00:04:35 Not anymore.
00:04:37 And when it puked 71 cents a few days ago.
00:04:39 A few days ago, not anymore.
00:04:41 Everyone was waiting for Elon to fucking bring the second coming of Doge, but it tanked like 40%.
00:04:47 Elon was too cringe.
00:04:49 Elon was too cringe on SNL and it tanked Dogecoin.
00:04:52 I mean, did anybody expect, I mean, no one expected it to be cool, did they?
00:04:56 No, but honestly.
00:04:58 The man's many things, but cool is not one of them.
00:05:01 Honestly, I was like thinking, I was like, Elon's going on SNL tonight.
00:05:06 There will never be a more like mainstream moment for Dogecoin to be mentioned.
00:05:12 I thought to myself, I probably should just buy Dogecoin because he's going to mention Dogecoin on SNL and Lyon go up.
00:05:20 Lyon will go up.
00:05:22 I'm shooting myself in the foot by not buying Dogecoin, but I didn't do it.
00:05:25 And I was totally wrong.
00:05:27 Lyon went down.
00:05:28 I was expecting it to go up too.
00:05:30 You would think so because every time he mentions it, it goes up.
00:05:34 Well, I guess when you put on a Wario suit, you kind of just lose all that goodwill.
00:05:40 I don't understand.
00:05:42 I don't understand.
00:05:44 The pattern was so clear.
00:05:46 I don't get it.
00:05:48 It's recovered a little bit, I think.
00:05:50 And then I saw people angry on Twitter because just like with GME, not Coinbase,
00:06:00 Robinhood was not letting them cash their Dogecoin out as it was falling.
00:06:04 They were like, what the fuck? Why can't I cash my Dogecoin out?
00:06:07 That's why it wasn't updating because I was looking at it last night.
00:06:11 That was happening.
00:06:13 There were just no numbers.
00:06:14 I was like, oh, is my internet fucked up or something?
00:06:16 No, I guess Robinhood once again decided to be scum.
00:06:21 I mean, what would we expect at this point?
00:06:25 They've shown their hand.
00:06:27 They really have.
00:06:28 The fact that I still use that service is a blight upon my name.
00:06:32 I signed up for an account when the shit was going down, but I never ended up using it for anything.
00:06:40 Good.
00:06:42 I did an account with an app called KuCoin that Brian from Clear Value Tax recommended.
00:06:55 And I fucked around with it a little bit.
00:06:58 I put in like $100 to just kind of fuck around with some of the shit in there
00:07:03 because they got weird things in that app.
00:07:06 You can sort of design parameters for a bot that will autotrade for you.
00:07:13 What's the other one?
00:07:16 You can put your money up for micro loans that other people will borrow from you
00:07:23 and then repay with interest.
00:07:25 Is this the thing you were talking about before,
00:07:27 where you're running it to see how long it would autotrade and min-max your gains?
00:07:32 Yeah, I mentioned it a while ago.
00:07:35 Because I did that a while ago.
00:07:37 And I mean, Brian from Clear Value Tax says that he gets like a fucking 25% return on his investment per year,
00:07:46 which is like an unbelievable return on investment.
00:07:49 But I realized that the downside is that you have to check it every day
00:07:55 and you have to update your parameters every day.
00:07:58 And I'm just not willing to do that.
00:08:02 Come on, boring things to do, like make video games.
00:08:05 That's right.
00:08:06 But I'm fucked because the money that is in there is in crypto.
00:08:11 I can't just withdraw the money from it.
00:08:16 I have to send it to some transfer service.
00:08:20 I have to make use of some third-party another app to cash my own money back out.
00:08:27 So fuck that.
00:08:29 Maybe it could make huge gains, but I'm just, I won't stick with it.
00:08:34 I won't check it all the time.
00:08:36 I'm not Brian.
00:08:37 I'm no Brian.
00:08:38 And you're right, making video games is more important.
00:08:41 It is.
00:08:42 In the grand scheme of things.
00:08:43 It's way more important.
00:08:44 I have to prove once and for all that 2D video games are just better.
00:08:49 I have to make the ultimate two-dimensional video game.
00:08:53 That's a shame.
00:08:54 You're choosing the inferior dimensions.
00:08:56 I can hear you.
00:08:57 Are my headphones dead?
00:08:58 Oh my God, my headphones are dead.
00:09:00 I'm sorry.
00:09:01 One sec.
00:09:02 Typical attitude from a 2D scrub, not having his headphones ready to go.
00:09:08 Meanwhile, the Chad 3D over here.
00:09:11 I'm back.
00:09:12 I'm sorry if I was talking over you.
00:09:14 If it was, it was because my headphones died.
00:09:17 I was just giving you shit for being a 2D person.
00:09:21 I just think they're neat.
00:09:24 I just think sprites are where it's at.
00:09:28 Pokemon peaked in Gen 5 and it's all been downhill from there.
00:09:31 So, I mean, what more proof do you need?
00:09:33 I don't know.
00:09:34 Final Fantasy 7 is 3D.
00:09:36 That's pretty good.
00:09:38 People seem to like Final Fantasy 7.
00:09:41 I like 6.
00:09:42 I like 6.
00:09:43 Okay.
00:09:44 I've never played Final Fantasy 7, so I can't say.
00:09:49 I'm just going off what other people have told me.
00:09:51 Is that right?
00:09:52 You never did?
00:09:53 Have you played 6?
00:09:54 I own it.
00:09:55 I haven't played 6.
00:09:56 I didn't have a Super Nintendo back when I was a second kid.
00:09:58 I never beat 6.
00:10:01 7 was the first Final Fantasy I played.
00:10:03 I think I played 8.
00:10:05 I think I played 9.
00:10:06 I never beat 9.
00:10:07 I think I went back and I played 6.
00:10:09 I got to the end of 9 and then my memory card died.
00:10:13 I got to the end of 9 and I didn't beat 9 either.
00:10:18 Same story with 6 and 9.
00:10:20 I just lost.
00:10:21 It's the worst.
00:10:22 I just lost momentum at the very end.
00:10:26 Some day.
00:10:27 Now they have the PC ports where you can speed up the battles and stuff.
00:10:30 Maybe I could justify in my busy life going through the game at Mach 10.
00:10:37 I don't care because I got to the only good part of 9,
00:10:41 which is the part where you're not alone plays.
00:10:43 I got to that part.
00:10:44 I've seen the best it has to offer.
00:10:46 I don't need anymore.
00:10:48 Okay.
00:10:49 The whole game is great.
00:10:51 But to each their own.
00:10:53 It's fine.
00:10:54 It's got 2D and 3D.
00:10:56 It's got 3D characters and 2D backgrounds.
00:10:59 It's a marriage of two contrasting mediums.
00:11:03 I guess it does have 2D backgrounds.
00:11:08 Kinda.
00:11:09 Are they all 2D?
00:11:10 Does it have all painted backgrounds?
00:11:12 The overworld and the battle areas are modeled,
00:11:16 but all the actual environments you move around in, they're all pre-rendered.
00:11:20 I didn't even know that.
00:11:22 Well, wait, 7 and 8 are the same, right?
00:11:25 Are 7 and 8 like that?
00:11:26 Yeah, they all use the pre-rendered backgrounds.
00:11:28 Right.
00:11:29 Yeah.
00:11:30 That's pretty cool.
00:11:33 My game is an RPG.
00:11:42 That's it.
00:11:44 That's true.
00:11:45 You're not wrong.
00:11:46 That's all I have to say.
00:11:48 Incredible.
00:11:53 This week, I've been spriting.
00:11:56 I've been spriting.
00:11:57 I wanted fancier animations for the things that Phantom does.
00:12:03 I made a nice animation for when he drinks.
00:12:06 I made a nice animation for when he throws.
00:12:09 I was right before we started.
00:12:11 I was working on one, a better one for when...
00:12:14 Wait, I'm not going to say what the last one is.
00:12:17 It's all just totally aesthetic stuff that doesn't actually get me any closer to releasing the...
00:12:28 Yeah, but it feels good.
00:12:30 I'm not doing it for money.
00:12:32 I'm not making this game so that I can make ends meet and put food on the table.
00:12:37 Why not just let it take however long it takes and just make it a masterpiece?
00:12:43 That's how you do it.
00:12:44 Just ignore the proper production and just chase whatever weird, fancy, straightforward stuff of the day.
00:12:53 Exactly.
00:12:54 Progression doesn't need to be a straight line.
00:12:55 Fuck that.
00:12:56 Exactly.
00:12:57 Do I know what your secret project...
00:13:01 Have you mentioned it to me or do I also not know?
00:13:04 I have not mentioned it to anybody.
00:13:06 I don't think.
00:13:07 Anybody?
00:13:08 I don't think so.
00:13:10 I don't think I've talked to any of you guys about it.
00:13:12 I'll probably be revealing it soon, though, based on the progress that's being made.
00:13:17 But I haven't just been doing a secret project.
00:13:19 I did a bunch of Patreon stuff, like I send out physical rewards to patrons, and I'm finishing up those.
00:13:24 I made a Zoomie...
00:13:27 I'll put a picture in the chat.
00:13:29 I did a Zoomie cookie cutters, and I did a Zoomie little figures, and then I printed and folded up some little boxes.
00:13:37 So you can put little figures in boxes.
00:13:38 It looks pretty cool.
00:13:42 Let me see.
00:13:43 Not that I'm complaining, but what possessed you to make a Zoomie cookie cutters?
00:13:49 What gave you that idea?
00:13:51 It was just something I learned how to do, and so I was like, oh, let's try.
00:13:54 Let's see what happens.
00:13:55 And it worked.
00:13:56 Because I had a 3D printer.
00:13:58 I had 3D modeling software, and it's like, alright, let's make a cookie cutter and see what happens.
00:14:03 And it worked.
00:14:04 And there they are.
00:14:05 It's pretty sick, and it took a lot of figuring out.
00:14:08 But that was one of the things I've been doing instead of being on the podcast, was figuring out how to make all that.
00:14:12 My headphones are dead again.
00:14:13 Oh my God.
00:14:14 Pat.
00:14:15 Jesus.
00:14:16 Pat, oh my God.
00:14:17 How is this possible?
00:14:18 What did you do last time if you didn't fix the problem?
00:14:20 Has he been this unprofessional the entire time I haven't been on the podcast, or is this a new thing that happens just when I show up?
00:14:27 I'm back.
00:14:29 I don't know.
00:14:31 I don't know.
00:14:32 The batteries are fucked up.
00:14:33 Have you made cookies with them, though?
00:14:35 I have not, because cookies aren't keto.
00:14:37 Oh, right, your keto.
00:14:38 Yeah, so.
00:14:39 I have been eating so many Parkview cheddar brats.
00:14:44 Oh, I get those all the time, too.
00:14:46 From Aldi?
00:14:47 Yep.
00:14:48 Hell yeah.
00:14:49 Hell yeah.
00:14:51 They just, they finally restocked the keto bread at my local Aldi.
00:14:56 I've never seen that at mine, which really sucks, but.
00:14:59 They don't, they don't stock it there?
00:15:01 No.
00:15:02 So I just, to make lettuce wraps, it's fine.
00:15:05 Honestly, I need to eat more greens.
00:15:07 I need to eat more vegetables.
00:15:09 The only vegetables I eat these days are like, sometimes I'll put a slice of tomato on like a BLT or something.
00:15:17 It's not enough.
00:15:18 It's not enough.
00:15:19 No, you gotta, I don't have enough vegetables either, but whatever.
00:15:23 It's so much easier and cheaper to just get a cheddar fucking thing.
00:15:27 Just get a cheddar brought.
00:15:28 Yeah, just put it in the fucking microwave or whatever and be like, all right, whatever.
00:15:32 Fuck it.
00:15:33 Just eat a cold slimy out of the fridge, you know, whatever.
00:15:36 That's true.
00:15:37 They're pre-cooked.
00:15:38 It's fine.
00:15:39 I do that sometimes.
00:15:40 Sometimes I get like the, the ballpark Franks they have there and just be like, I don't
00:15:42 need to fucking do good and just like whatever.
00:15:44 I got work to do.
00:15:46 The best, I was shocked, I was shocked by this, but the best deal.
00:15:51 I think one of the best deals on like fatty meat, you know, the cornerstone of any keto
00:15:57 diet that I have found is at Costco, no, not Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club.
00:16:02 They sell like boxes of like six packs of like five hot dogs.
00:16:10 So it's like 30 hot dogs in a box.
00:16:12 They're Oscar Meyer, which you would, you would think that like name brand wouldn't be as cheap,
00:16:17 but BJ's Wholesale Club, these boxes of hot dogs, they're so, they're really cheap.
00:16:22 They're really cheap.
00:16:23 I think, I think like the Instacart like just started servicing BJ's.
00:16:29 So I've like, I've recently gained access to these dogs.
00:16:32 Also, little disappointing story, disappointing story for me today.
00:16:37 I ordered sparkling water and Instacart said that sparkling water, that there was like a
00:16:44 different set of flavors.
00:16:46 Whereas before I would always get berry, lemon and lime.
00:16:50 It said that, oh, now we're selling packs of berry, lime and peach, ginger.
00:16:57 And I was like, oh my God, this is going to change everything.
00:17:00 This is going to shake up my routine.
00:17:03 I ordered them and no, it was a lie.
00:17:06 They're the same.
00:17:07 They got the same old, same three.
00:17:10 Nice.
00:17:11 It's great.
00:17:16 You just can't trust Instacart.
00:17:18 A lot of the times like the shoppers I get from Instacart, they'll just swap things
00:17:22 without telling you that they've swapped things.
00:17:24 And so you just get completely random shit that you didn't ask for.
00:17:27 That has happened very rarely.
00:17:29 That has happened very rarely to me.
00:17:31 And I have taken, I take great pains to like, if I'm concerned that like they might make
00:17:37 like now whenever I order from Aldi and I get the gridlocks, I or I like specifically type
00:17:43 in the text box like, hi, please only get the red and white gridlocks.
00:17:48 Thank you.
00:17:49 Or if I'm ordering the ice cream, like please only get the keto ice cream.
00:17:52 Like I specifically tell them because like I've had some people like, oh, they'll just
00:17:55 replace it with some other ice cream or oh, they'll just replace it with some other bread.
00:17:58 Like, ah, bread's bread, right?
00:18:00 No.
00:18:01 Fools.
00:18:02 But it's, it's when I, when I'm fucking let them know, they generally don't fuck with
00:18:08 me.
00:18:09 I've had pretty good luck with my, with that.
00:18:12 And I always get, I always give them a five star review, even though I don't know if it
00:18:16 helps them at all.
00:18:18 Probably doesn't, unfortunately.
00:18:20 Probably not.
00:18:21 Yeah.
00:18:22 Sad.
00:18:23 Probably just boost the app in the algorithm or something.
00:18:26 You're just helping the corporation.
00:18:28 We just don't know.
00:18:30 I don't.
00:18:31 Speaking of corporations, I love how Facebook is super pissed.
00:18:35 Did you hear about that?
00:18:36 No.
00:18:37 What's up with Facebook?
00:18:38 So do you know how like there's been a big spat between Facebook and Apple for the last
00:18:43 like couple months?
00:18:44 No.
00:18:45 You heard about that.
00:18:46 So Apple is rolling out this new feature and it just launched like a couple of weeks
00:18:49 ago in the new version of like the iPhone's OS where it will, every time an application
00:18:55 tries to track you, a little pop up will come up.
00:18:58 It's like, this app wants to track you.
00:19:00 Do you allow it to and that like fucks Facebook's entire business because they're, it's all
00:19:05 about stealthily tracking you across all your fucking shit and selling that data to advertisers.
00:19:10 And Apple's like, well, we don't sell ads.
00:19:13 So let's just let our users know that all their data is being stolen.
00:19:18 And so like, I guess the opt out rate has been 96% in the first like month that this
00:19:24 feature has been available and Facebook's like fucking panicking because like their entire
00:19:27 business is like being blown up right now.
00:19:30 It's pretty funny.
00:19:31 Is it Apple's fault?
00:19:32 I don't, I don't quite understand.
00:19:36 So key.
00:19:37 So the problem here is that people are opting out of having their data harvested, right?
00:19:40 Like that's the problem.
00:19:41 Yeah.
00:19:42 I mean, it's a problem for Facebook.
00:19:43 It's good for the users, arguably, because like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:19:46 All these applications, you know, there's, there's something, there's like a unique code
00:19:50 attached to your iPhone and that code allows the data to be transferred between applications
00:19:57 because it puts, it basically puts a name to the face, right?
00:19:59 It's like every time you do something, it matches us up with that code.
00:20:03 So other apps know what you're shopping for, what you're searching for and things like
00:20:06 that.
00:20:07 And so Apple added a feature where instead of it just doing that automatically and sharing
00:20:11 that number, it's like, if you don't want to share this data, you can opt out and we'll
00:20:16 just send zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero for the number.
00:20:18 So it can't match you with anything.
00:20:20 So the data that it gets is useless.
00:20:23 So this was like Apple being like two pro consumer, right?
00:20:28 And it like fucked Facebook over.
00:20:29 That's the problem.
00:20:30 Exactly.
00:20:31 Yeah.
00:20:32 And they like took out a big like ad in the New York Times saying Apple's attacking small
00:20:36 businesses that rely on our ad platform.
00:20:38 So we're sticking up to Apple and all this shit.
00:20:41 But then you listen to their earnings call and all the investors are like, oh, we're
00:20:46 so fucked.
00:20:47 Oh, shit.
00:20:48 This is really bad.
00:20:49 Our business is going to be so fucked.
00:20:50 And it's pretty funny.
00:20:51 I hate.
00:20:52 I just hate them.
00:20:53 So fucking sucks so much.
00:20:56 Jesus Christ.
00:20:57 Yeah.
00:20:58 I mean, it's it's grimy.
00:21:01 Did you see those?
00:21:02 I don't know.
00:21:03 Did you see those?
00:21:04 Um, the ad, like you seem like anti-union ads.
00:21:07 Oh, they're the worst, the worst, like the one from I used to be in a union, take my
00:21:14 idea.
00:21:15 Why would I pay dues to a union?
00:21:17 My employer handles it all better for me anyway, you know.
00:21:20 Do you remember last year all the right to repair for your mongering ads that were airing
00:21:23 in Massachusetts?
00:21:24 I didn't really see the ads, but I heard about the repair stuff.
00:21:28 They were so funny.
00:21:29 There was this one ad where like it was like first person of some like creepy guy in a parking
00:21:33 lot and some like vulnerable young woman walks over to her car and tries to unlock it.
00:21:39 And then this guy comes and like, it cuts to black as like she gets like assaulted and
00:21:42 it's like, right, to repair will allow your family to get raped.
00:21:46 And it's just like, no, come on, that's not it.
00:21:50 What does that mean?
00:21:53 It just means they're just fear mongering like, oh, if anybody can access the proprietary
00:21:57 information of your car, they can like remotely unlock your car and hack your car and attack
00:22:02 your family.
00:22:03 Like he could get into the car because he hacked into the mainframe.
00:22:07 Yeah.
00:22:08 Yeah.
00:22:09 It's some really dumb shit.
00:22:10 I'm so embarrassed for my state right now.
00:22:12 So it's a security.
00:22:13 They're saying that a right to repair prevents a secure, presents a security risk.
00:22:18 I guess I see, okay, fair.
00:22:24 You know, I'm convinced no, no one, no one article, whatever.
00:22:28 Yeah.
00:22:29 Whatever the fuck it was.
00:22:30 Yeah.
00:22:31 Or that, oh God, what company is it?
00:22:34 Which one of the airlines was like, instead of paying your union fees, you can buy a new
00:22:38 game console.
00:22:39 Yeah.
00:22:40 Shit.
00:22:41 Fuck yeah.
00:22:42 Delta was Delta who did that.
00:22:43 Right.
00:22:44 They were, why don't you fucking buy me a fucking.
00:22:48 Jokes on you Delta, no one can buy a fucking video game console.
00:22:50 They're all sold out.
00:22:51 Oh yeah.
00:22:52 Oh yeah.
00:22:53 They still, people still can't get PS5s.
00:22:58 The, the silicon shortage is probably going to be going all the way to the end of next
00:23:02 year.
00:23:03 The rate things are going.
00:23:04 Jesus.
00:23:06 Like $300 graphics cards right now are being resold for almost 1500.
00:23:11 That just because they're impossible to find.
00:23:15 That is fucked up.
00:23:16 The shortage is so bad, like before, like they would launch a card at MSRP, they'd immediately
00:23:22 sell out because like people are using bots to like scalp them all.
00:23:25 Now like now the stores are just selling them for three times as much because they're like,
00:23:28 if they're going to sell for that, we might as well make three times the money.
00:23:31 Yeah.
00:23:32 And it's just like, it just doesn't, you can't get cards for normal prices.
00:23:36 And there's like, all of the manufacturing is done in Taiwan and Taiwan's facing a huge
00:23:41 drought right now.
00:23:42 And one of the most important things you need to manufacture silicon is like fresh water.
00:23:46 So it's just going to get worse.
00:23:48 It's so fucking bad.
00:23:50 Wow.
00:23:51 Yeah.
00:23:52 It's a nightmare.
00:23:53 Fuck.
00:23:54 Well, like, God, I hope nothing happens to my fucking computer, man.
00:23:56 Oh, shit.
00:23:58 It's like really bad.
00:23:59 And then like there was another cryptocurrency that's trying to mine using hard drive.
00:24:03 So now like hard drive prices might start skyrocketing too.
00:24:05 And it's just, yeah, it's great.
00:24:08 It's super cool.
00:24:09 Very good.
00:24:10 Very good.
00:24:11 Yeah.
00:24:12 That's unfortunate.
00:24:14 I've just wanted a new graphics card and I can't get one because they're just impossible.
00:24:18 It's like, I'm not going to spend $2,000 for a $400 graphics card.
00:24:22 I refuse.
00:24:25 I was watching stream highlights from your movie Sucks where he was watching the Dar Man
00:24:36 videos.
00:24:37 Do you know what those are?
00:24:39 No.
00:24:40 What's that?
00:24:41 I mentioned it just because there was one video.
00:24:44 It was like it was about like Christmas where like a girl wants to be a girl gamer, but
00:24:49 her mom doesn't think girls can play video games.
00:24:52 So her brother gets a PS5 for Christmas and she's not allowed to play it because girls
00:25:01 can't play video games.
00:25:03 The Dar Man.
00:25:04 Is this a new thing then if it's a PS5?
00:25:07 Well, the video was new.
00:25:08 I mean, this is a huge channel.
00:25:12 It's got like seven million subscribers and it gets like tens of millions of views.
00:25:16 Okay.
00:25:17 I hadn't really heard about it, but like I've seen things like it before.
00:25:21 The Dar Man is basically a guy who runs a channel where the thumbnail and the title
00:25:28 will be like something like Lady Accuses Black Man of kidnapping a child, but instantly regrets
00:25:41 it.
00:25:42 Right?
00:25:43 It's sort of phrased as though it's like candid footage of like, oh, we caught someone
00:25:47 being racist or we caught someone.
00:25:49 But it's not that.
00:25:50 It's a skit.
00:25:51 It's like an overly dramatic, like sort of tear jerking skit that like where like someone
00:26:00 is mean to someone or bullies someone or is racist or bigoted or something.
00:26:04 And then they are made the fool and they learn a valuable lesson.
00:26:10 And it's always like, you judge me for being a black woman raising a white daughter.
00:26:17 Well, you see, I knew her mother and she died of cancer and she was my best friend.
00:26:25 And I promised to raise that baby.
00:26:29 And I'm so sorry I judged you for being a black woman with a white daughter.
00:26:34 You ever forgive me?
00:26:37 Fascinating.
00:26:38 So of course they have millions of subscribers.
00:26:43 They have so many fucking views.
00:26:46 They get so many fucking views.
00:26:48 They get and it's like, what are we doing, Ben?
00:26:50 Why are we doing this?
00:26:51 We're doing an hour long podcast every week, trying to make art with integrity when all
00:26:55 we need to do is just Eleazar, what I want you to do.
00:27:00 I want you to make the thumbnail, go to the Darman YouTube channel and see his thumbnails
00:27:07 and just make the thumbnail for this episode look like that big text on the left and a
00:27:13 face on the right and title this one, I don't know, podcasters, podcasters, I don't know,
00:27:24 make a new episode but instantly regret it.
00:27:28 That's just every week.
00:27:29 What are you talking about?
00:27:30 Yeah, but we got to make it a title and it's got to be in all caps.
00:27:34 And yeah, yeah, we're going, we're going corporate.
00:27:39 We got to appeal to lowest common denominator.
00:27:42 The only market that's left, it's the only market that pays, got to get those 15 year
00:27:45 olds to click on our links constantly.
00:27:48 And it's like, you know, every every episode he ends with like, you know, share this video
00:27:54 around if you like this message, share this video around because you're not just, we're
00:28:00 not just telling stories, we're changing lives, right?
00:28:04 The message is like, yeah, the message is like, this is a video about how racism is
00:28:08 bad.
00:28:09 If you think racism is bad, you'll share this video.
00:28:13 Left unsaid is and if you don't share this video, then what is that fucking thing about
00:28:18 you?
00:28:19 Jesus Christ.
00:28:20 Oh, there's one, there's one that's like pro cop.
00:28:27 People in my discord were showing me these this morning.
00:28:29 There's one that's pro cop and it's like the lady is like, fire all cops, all cops are
00:28:34 bad.
00:28:35 And then she gets mugged and she's like, oh, help police.
00:28:38 And the cop is like, anytime, ma'am, you see, everyone judges me for being a cop.
00:28:45 Everyone thinks that I'm bad and I'm racist.
00:28:47 But actually I'm just trying to put food on the table for my black wife and our mixed
00:28:51 race daughter.
00:28:52 And so you see, before you hate me, get to know me before you judge me and it's treated
00:28:59 exact same being a cop, being a cop, it's just the same.
00:29:04 It's just the same as being a hard put upon black mom raising a white daughter and nobody
00:29:08 understands you.
00:29:09 It's the same goddamn thing.
00:29:12 Every goddamn time, tragic.
00:29:15 Oh, my God, pure art over there, it's hideous, it's hideous, hideous abomination of a channel.
00:29:22 It's a nightmare.
00:29:23 And of course YouTube rewards it, I don't know, I droves, I guess it's kids, I guess
00:29:28 it's kids that just, I don't know, want to be preached to or something.
00:29:34 I don't.
00:29:35 It's the calls to action, dude, I was because I was thinking about this because I was like,
00:29:39 it's the clickable thumbnail, it's the clickbait title, and it's the calls to the irresistible
00:29:43 calls to action.
00:29:44 I was thinking about like, because I remember Fred Letter Media hit a million subscribers,
00:29:50 like, I think last year they finally hit a million subscribers despite being around
00:29:54 for like a decade.
00:29:56 And I think it might have been on the podcast, we were asking the question like, why is
00:29:59 Fred Letter Media like so prevalent in popular culture, but like didn't have nearly as much
00:30:04 subscribers as they should get sitting all along, they've been active, and it's because
00:30:07 they have no calls to action.
00:30:09 Like people are just that fucking brain dead that they would need to have to like end every
00:30:14 video, like comment, subscribe, and they don't, and that's probably why they've only grown
00:30:19 like a tenth of what they probably should be considering their otherwise cultural impact.
00:30:23 Maybe.
00:30:24 Maybe.
00:30:25 I think people, you know what, because like I think about putting calls to action in
00:30:30 my content, but I'm just like, nobody needs that.
00:30:32 And I'm like, no, the brain dead masses need to be told what to do.
00:30:37 I'm not, I'm not above, I'm not above a call to action.
00:30:40 I know it works.
00:30:41 I'm, well, that's the whole thing.
00:30:43 Like I'm not saying that I'm above it.
00:30:44 I just feel like my natural like gut reaction is like it's not necessary, but it really
00:30:50 is.
00:30:51 Yeah, it really is.
00:30:52 I mean, I mean, you know, people like the red letter media guys because they come off
00:30:56 as pretty genuine.
00:30:58 And part of that is that they don't do a lot of calls to action.
00:31:01 They don't do a lot of like, you to be like, comment, subscribe stuff.
00:31:05 They can't because as soon as they do, it's like, don't you guys do the nerd crew?
00:31:08 Like this is blurring the lines a little bit.
00:31:10 Like they've kind of locked themselves into not being able to, I mean, they obviously
00:31:14 they don't need to because they're still really successful, but it's just like it's, they're
00:31:17 just such a good case study for like, despite making great content consistently for a long
00:31:22 time and like really having a large like impact on just like the kind of like internet culture
00:31:28 at large, their subscriber count really doesn't reflect it because they're not jingling the
00:31:32 keys in front of people.
00:31:34 I mean, is their content like, I know to you and I, maybe like red letter media seems like
00:31:43 very digestible, like appeals to everyone content.
00:31:48 But is it though?
00:31:49 Like is, like it's film, even like humorous film criticism, is film criticism like the
00:31:54 kind of thing that like, you know, is it, is it universal in the same way that like a melodramatic
00:32:03 skit about how racism makes people feel bad is universal?
00:32:07 You're not going to get to fucking whatever that channel is called.
00:32:11 Dar man.
00:32:12 Dar man.
00:32:13 You know, you're not going to get Dar man, J station numbers off of Plinkett reviews,
00:32:17 but it just seems like they're still, they're still underrepresented.
00:32:21 Like I think they probably could have like two or three million subs if they actually
00:32:25 like promoted themselves.
00:32:27 Maybe the struggle struggle is real struggle this week, I know it's been time has been
00:32:39 going faster and faster, but this week in particular, like I feel like we just did
00:32:45 the last one.
00:32:46 I've been, I've been working on the game, like the whole week and I feel like I didn't
00:32:50 get anything done.
00:32:51 I feel like all I did was I got some sprites done and I, and I put in some animations and
00:32:56 I'm like, that's, that takes a long fucking time.
00:33:01 I've been doing animation stuff for the last like couple of weeks and it just takes forever.
00:33:07 Cause like you just have to like stare at the frames and be like, do I tweak this?
00:33:11 Do I tweak that?
00:33:12 And it just, it's a lot of like monotonous, just like tweaks and shit.
00:33:17 It's, it's pretty fun.
00:33:20 I like it a lot because I get, I get lots of little like moment, like I get lots of
00:33:27 making this game.
00:33:28 I do find some things are very difficult, but other things are simple and give me lots
00:33:34 of opportunity for like small moments of success that I can enjoy.
00:33:39 Like, you know, I, I, I mentioned all those like new animations that I added this week
00:33:46 and every single, each time I successfully made one, I'm like, yes, it looks really
00:33:51 good when he does that now.
00:33:52 Like, oh, another one.
00:33:53 Yeah, bam, another one in the bag.
00:33:55 You know, I had to make one, I made, I figured out one little change I could do that would
00:34:00 make them like when you take damage instead of the number just changing instantly, it
00:34:04 like kind of rolls down sort of like earthbound and it looks way better.
00:34:08 And I'm like, yes, I nail it.
00:34:10 It's just got to get that juice.
00:34:11 It's all fucking good.
00:34:13 It's like, it's like that physics professor I had that one year who told us that when
00:34:19 you solve a problem, feel good about it.
00:34:22 Let yourself feel good when you solve a problem so that your brain will learn that
00:34:26 solving physics problems is good and you'll be motivated to do more.
00:34:32 Your physics professor was the best game dev teacher you could ask for.
00:34:36 He was a fucking Buddhist hippie.
00:34:43 And he was huge.
00:34:45 He was huge, huge, like fat or huge, like swole.
00:34:49 No, just very tall.
00:34:51 He wasn't, he wasn't fat.
00:34:53 He wasn't skinny either.
00:34:54 He was like, he was, you know, a normal build, but he was like, he was like six
00:34:59 foot eight or something.
00:35:00 He was just like, yeah, he was a giant.
00:35:05 Yeah, based.
00:35:07 That's pretty sick.
00:35:08 Yeah.
00:35:10 Are you coding the game in Python or like, I am coding the game in GML, which is just
00:35:16 like the proprietary game maker code.
00:35:19 It's very similar to Python and a lot.
00:35:22 Like I've, yeah, it's, it's, it's a lot like Python.
00:35:25 Cool, cool.
00:35:27 What it, I don't know, what do you fucking do?
00:35:29 What do you fucking do?
00:35:31 Huh?
00:35:31 What do I do?
00:35:32 What do you fucking do?
00:35:33 I make polygons move.
00:35:36 Do you, do you, do you code shit?
00:35:39 Um, I've done a little bit of Python and I've looked a little bit into C sharp and a
00:35:44 little bit into, uh, what's it called?
00:35:47 A GD script, which is Godot's native scripting language.
00:35:51 I'm not good at any of them.
00:35:53 Remind me, which we're interested in the animation side, but I don't.
00:35:56 Okay.
00:35:57 To, to make like the, to make like the, like the combat, the, like the turn based
00:36:03 combat system, I basically just followed a, a, a, a tutorial that I found on YouTube.
00:36:12 Um, there's a lot of junk code in there that is just like, like there's a whole
00:36:16 like magic menu that's in there that I just put in there because the tutorial told me
00:36:21 to, um, but it doesn't do anything and you can't access it, but it's just there
00:36:24 because I was following the tutorial.
00:36:26 Um, that's in there.
00:36:28 And then that, like that part was hard and like, there were parts of it where like,
00:36:33 okay, well, he told me to do it this way, but I want to modify it.
00:36:36 I want to change it.
00:36:37 So it does this.
00:36:37 Okay.
00:36:38 And like that was hard, but like after that, basically everything else that I've done
00:36:44 code wise, almost everything else that I've added on top of it is just like increasingly
00:36:49 complex, like sets of if else statements and it's just, I don't feel like I'm, I know
00:36:59 anything, I don't feel like I'm doing anything.
00:37:03 It's surprising how far you can get with if statements, variables and like a basic kind
00:37:09 of like state machine and you're just like, Oh, that's like, yeah, that is exactly what
00:37:14 it is.
00:37:14 That's exactly what it is.
00:37:15 It's like the basic loop of the game is that like, you know, the character is there.
00:37:20 Then like the menu is active.
00:37:23 You select something in the menu, you select it.
00:37:26 And then the menu goes into wait mode.
00:37:28 The character does a little thing.
00:37:31 He has a little timer that counts down while he does his thing.
00:37:34 And then when he finishes doing the thing, it ticks the box that makes him go back to
00:37:38 wait mode and the menu goes back to active mode, rinse and repeat.
00:37:42 And then in those little actions, it's just a series of, you know, calculate these
00:37:46 numbers, apply these numbers, move it here and there, change his right to this and that.
00:37:52 Yeah, yeah, it's amazing how much of video games is just if those statements.
00:37:57 Yeah, I used, I used a list.
00:38:00 I used a list function because the tutorial told me to.
00:38:04 So I used one list and everything else is just like, if this statement is true, then
00:38:11 do this when you hit the spacebar.
00:38:14 I think the most complicated thing I did in the Izumi and Vertical Slice game was
00:38:19 putting in the dialogue system because I couldn't find a tutorial for it.
00:38:23 And I wanted to have it so it would pull text, put it into the box, have it like
00:38:29 print out in a typewriter text kind of format, and then also pull up the
00:38:33 character's name and portrait with different expressions to go with each line of dialogue.
00:38:38 So I ended up using like a 3D array.
00:38:41 Oh, it was really weird because like I put all the 3D array.
00:38:46 Yeah, it's like so as in like so as in like dimension like like axis one is like
00:38:53 what character axis two is like what expression and like what axis three is, I
00:38:58 don't know, I don't know.
00:38:59 It was like it was like X and Y.
00:39:01 And then the Z was just that like each Z was like different array.
00:39:04 So it was like arrays nested inside arrays.
00:39:07 So there would be like you would have, oh God, it's been so long.
00:39:12 I have a whole video explaining how I did it.
00:39:13 But there was like one that had the name of the character that was speaking, the
00:39:17 line, and those would be two different columns with the same row.
00:39:21 And then the rows would have a number and it would just like iterate through
00:39:24 those numbers and then on the second array and like the third, like the Z axis, that
00:39:29 would be the, it would call the animation frames for the portrait sprite.
00:39:33 And so it would just count down and that one column would match up to both all the
00:39:37 rows and kind of have everything sync up is very strange, but it's pretty cool.
00:39:42 Yeah, portrait sprites are something I need to make a bunch of, I used like a
00:39:47 placeholder one in the demo, but I want to make a bunch of expressions.
00:39:50 And I kind of want to like just like lightly animate them for the final game.
00:39:57 The speaking of which, though, I did manage to do a little shortcut because
00:40:02 the champion game that I made a while back, it had, I made a little fancy
00:40:07 like dialogue boxes that like sort of like type out all the characters and it
00:40:12 makes the little undertale sound.
00:40:15 So I like basically just copy pasted like those, that like text box code, like
00:40:20 directly from that game into the new one and just use it again.
00:40:23 And it works great.
00:40:25 It's reusing code.
00:40:26 That's like the one on one of like being smart with your design.
00:40:30 Yeah, why reinvent the wheel?
00:40:33 Exactly.
00:40:33 I believe I also followed a tutorial to make those text boxes in the first place.
00:40:38 So I'm just, yeah, stealing from myself that thing, which I borrowed
00:40:45 from some other guy.
00:40:46 That's how you learn.
00:40:47 It's just like going through tutorials and figuring things out and reverse
00:40:50 engineering it.
00:40:51 And then you start iterating on that and be like, OK, I understand how this works.
00:40:55 How can I tweak it so it does this instead?
00:40:58 And that's kind of how you learn.
00:40:59 And then it becomes kind of second nature.
00:41:02 Making games is sick.
00:41:04 It's it's it's pretty sick.
00:41:06 I'm getting into it.
00:41:07 And it's, I like, I like that it's a series of small tasks that I can that I
00:41:17 can complete and I can finish.
00:41:19 I can be like, I can have like a list.
00:41:21 I wrote out like a list of like here are a bunch of features that I want to add.
00:41:25 And I would like work on one for like an hour and then like done, cross it off,
00:41:29 work on another one for like two hours done, cross it off.
00:41:32 And like, by the end of the day, I've got like four or five crossed off.
00:41:34 I'm like, yes, I made measurable progress.
00:41:38 That's fucking wild.
00:41:41 Yeah, it's always super sick.
00:41:42 Feels good.
00:41:44 I like it.
00:41:48 Let's see.
00:41:50 Do I have anything else to say about that?
00:41:54 No.
00:41:56 Sick.
00:41:57 No.
00:41:58 Ben, have you ever seen on the internet, on like Twitter, where they'll take they'll
00:42:04 take like designs of like a corporate logo or something and like switch it with
00:42:10 like another company.
00:42:11 So like be Burger King, but like it looks like a McDonald's logo and like vice
00:42:16 versa, and it looks really weird and off-putting because it's like this is an
00:42:19 iconography I've recognized, but they've changed the brand or something like that.
00:42:22 So like like a like a logo for McDonald's, but presented in like a Burger King aesthetic.
00:42:29 Yeah.
00:42:29 So like they'll take they'll take like the font choice and like the graphic design
00:42:34 of like Burger King, but make it say McDonald's or like take Coke and make it
00:42:37 say Pepsi, just like switch the designs and just like is really weird.
00:42:42 I can picture it, but I don't think I've seen posts like that.
00:42:46 No, I've seen a couple of them.
00:42:48 The only reason I bring that up is because I walked into Comby's yesterday.
00:42:53 Comby's I haven't been in a Comby's in years.
00:42:55 Shout out to Comby's and Comby's and that's that for anyone for anyone who
00:43:01 doesn't live in like the very specific part of Southern New England that we live
00:43:06 in that's short for Cumberland Farms.
00:43:08 It's a it's a local institution.
00:43:11 Yeah, it's just like a convenience store.
00:43:13 So I walked in I walked in the old Comby's and they had sitting in the cooler
00:43:18 when I went to go get my Red Bull, they had monster like monsters,
00:43:23 like the sugar free monster, but it was in a 12 ounce can
00:43:28 like Red Bull, they have a new size and I have the 12 ounce cans.
00:43:32 They have a small size.
00:43:33 They have a small size now.
00:43:34 Why would you want that?
00:43:35 Why would you want less of it?
00:43:37 It confused me to no end because it was like one of those tweets where it's
00:43:40 like it's a Red Bull, it's a Red Bull can, but it has a monster in it.
00:43:43 And it looked like a Photoshop.
00:43:44 It didn't look like it was a real thing.
00:43:46 And I was very confused.
00:43:47 I was taken aback.
00:43:48 That's I'm not in the market for that product at all.
00:43:52 It was cheaper though.
00:43:53 It was cheaper than buying the bigger ones.
00:43:54 They were running a sale on it because it was new.
00:43:56 So I got three of those and well, if it's cheaper, if it's cheaper by volume,
00:44:01 then sure it was.
00:44:02 I did the math, you know, good.
00:44:04 I'm a frugal man when it comes to my fake money I get from the government
00:44:08 to buy things.
00:44:09 Absolutely, absolutely.
00:44:11 That's how you got to do it.
00:44:12 Yeah, well, my fake money has been biting me in the ass as you heard.
00:44:16 But yes.
00:44:17 Oh, God, we didn't talk about that.
00:44:18 There's nobody knows what I'm referring to.
00:44:20 Gee, I mean, we give it like came up on the stream and I said, like, we
00:44:27 shouldn't go into detail about it if you weren't there.
00:44:29 But if you want to complain about it, like I don't even know how to complain
00:44:34 about it. It's just ridiculous that like, yeah, because like I've been
00:44:38 collecting pandemic unemployment because right, why wouldn't you, right?
00:44:43 And everything seemed to be going fine.
00:44:47 I re-upped the because you have to like recertify, you know, every every year
00:44:51 or whatever, because I did my taxes and I got a notification saying like, yeah,
00:44:55 you're re-upped for it.
00:44:56 And then like last week, I got another message saying, actually, we changed
00:45:02 our minds, you're not eligible for any payment since January.
00:45:06 You know, oh, that's $10,000.
00:45:08 And I was like, oh, no.
00:45:10 Did they did they ask you for like, oh, God, what is it?
00:45:15 Like, like a like a document discovery, like you had to like resubmit your.
00:45:19 Yeah, they did.
00:45:20 They sent me that the day after they said I qualified and I just didn't see it.
00:45:26 But here's the thing on May 4th is when they were like, actually, you no
00:45:30 longer qualify, we're taking all your money back retroactively.
00:45:33 But the notice that they sent me for the certification says you have until
00:45:36 July or June 21st to recertify and like go into your account to this link to
00:45:42 recertify and there's just you go to the link and there's just nothing.
00:45:45 When when I when I got unemployment like years ago, like when I this was
00:45:53 after I got laid off from a job and I was just collecting unemployment
00:45:58 insurance, like, you know, from the employer, basically, I got like they
00:46:05 ended up like overpaying me, but like only by like 200 bucks or something.
00:46:10 And I think I don't know.
00:46:12 Yeah, I think I just like appealed it and they like waived it.
00:46:16 I'm like shocked that they can just say like, hey, we overpaid you.
00:46:21 We decided that we didn't want to give you that like thousands of dollars.
00:46:26 Right.
00:46:27 Give it back.
00:46:28 It's super fucked.
00:46:29 I'm shocked that that's something that they can do and will do.
00:46:35 Yeah, they're doing it to me right now.
00:46:37 So I file an appeal, which I did fucked up.
00:46:40 Yeah, yeah.
00:46:41 But like the thing is, is like you file an appeal and just nothing changes.
00:46:44 So like it's it's not saying like it's in dispute or anything.
00:46:47 It's just still saying there on the homepage like you oh 10 grand.
00:46:52 But they're like, you still need to keep collecting every week.
00:46:55 Yeah, but we won't pay you.
00:46:57 You'll just be claiming it.
00:46:59 And then when we schedule your later, maybe in like four months, if you win,
00:47:03 then we'll give you all the back pay.
00:47:05 And if not, we'll just keep all the stuff.
00:47:07 So like between now and the appeal, you just don't get paid anymore, which is cool.
00:47:13 And I got on the phone and talked to somebody on the helpline and like.
00:47:18 So I have to do this and like, yeah, we're not going to pay you.
00:47:21 Like, so how do I live?
00:47:22 And they were just like, we don't know.
00:47:25 Is there anything else we can help you with?
00:47:26 And I'm just like, I'll just go have a panic attack now by.
00:47:30 Did they, OK, because I know that they have the there's like regular unemployment
00:47:37 and then there's like the pandemic unemployment assistance, which is like
00:47:40 the extra on top of the regular.
00:47:43 Did they retroactively cancel like all of it or just all of it?
00:47:47 All of it, both all of it's gone.
00:47:49 But here's the funny thing.
00:47:51 It says on because, you know, you've you've gone on the website, you know how
00:47:53 like there's a side that there's like one column that says like what you're
00:47:57 what you qualify for every week.
00:47:59 And then the main column is like, you know, fill out your claim here or whatever.
00:48:02 It says like all the ones that are pending or whatnot.
00:48:05 Yeah. On that column, it's like you owe 10 grand.
00:48:08 On the other column, it's like, you still qualify.
00:48:10 You have 44 weeks remaining.
00:48:11 Here's what you get every week.
00:48:13 I'm just like, you guys are sending me mixed messages right now.
00:48:15 I'm very confused. Oh my God.
00:48:17 So my God.
00:48:19 Yeah.
00:48:20 I told my dad about it because like he loves dunking on the state.
00:48:25 And I'm like, look at the state did now.
00:48:27 And he's like, oh, I know a lawyer.
00:48:30 Talk to my lawyer friend.
00:48:31 So now I'm going to go talk to a lawyer tomorrow and see if good.
00:48:35 That's what you should be doing.
00:48:37 Take some fucking legal action.
00:48:39 Yeah.
00:48:40 I almost don't want to step too much into the muck because I feel like
00:48:43 at some point someone might be like, so you just sit at home on the internet.
00:48:46 You've been collecting unemployment.
00:48:48 Like, do you really not need it?
00:48:49 And like, I could make my case that like, well, I can't go to conventions.
00:48:52 Nobody needs nobody.
00:48:54 A bunch of people are fucking bleeding.
00:48:55 Like every month I lose like three or four patrons a month
00:48:59 because they don't have any money.
00:49:00 And like my whole like, if you're if you lose your job,
00:49:03 the first thing you're going to do is stop paying your artists on Patreon.
00:49:06 You know, so like, oh, I don't know.
00:49:09 Unless unless they all get unemployment too,
00:49:12 and then they can put their unemployment money towards all the fun bucks go
00:49:17 kind of just all over the place.
00:49:19 I see, I see.
00:49:20 Why not?
00:49:21 I mean, why not?
00:49:23 It's as good as any.
00:49:24 It's all fake anyway.
00:49:26 It is all fake.
00:49:27 It is all fake.
00:49:27 Speaking of fake money, I saw an article saying that if you had
00:49:31 taken all your stimulus checks and invested them in Dogecoin,
00:49:34 you would have made four hundred fifty thousand dollars in gains.
00:49:37 And that hurt my soul.
00:49:39 Wait, no, four hundred and that's not true.
00:49:43 That can't be.
00:49:44 No, because like the last the last the last check was like,
00:49:48 well, like two months ago, right?
00:49:49 Like when they put it out in February.
00:49:52 In February, it was still only like like ten cents at the most.
00:49:57 So when Oh, in Dogecoin.
00:49:59 Oh, yeah, you know what?
00:50:01 Oh, yeah, yeah, like the first one.
00:50:03 So if you had put all fourteen hundred, that first you would have like over,
00:50:06 you know, like fifteen K just from that.
00:50:09 And then if you the first two was when it was under a penny.
00:50:13 So you would have been fucking you would have like times fifty.
00:50:18 You would have like fifty times that initial like that initial, you know,
00:50:21 twelve hundred, you're at now, you're I am.
00:50:23 Yeah, fuck fuck.
00:50:25 Yeah, it hurts.
00:50:26 It hurts to think about it. I hate it.
00:50:27 I hate it. So fuck you.
00:50:29 I hate cryptocurrency.
00:50:30 The thing that hurts the most, dude.
00:50:32 The thing that's where I hate owning cryptocurrency and I hate my whole fucking thing
00:50:36 into Doge, I almost put that fourteen hundred into Dogecoin.
00:50:39 But I was like, no, I'm going to be safe.
00:50:40 I'm going to bank it. I might be moving this year. I need money.
00:50:43 You bought some little. Did I know?
00:50:45 Oh, yeah, I have I still have
00:50:48 a little over three thousand Dogecoin.
00:50:51 So it's like about eighteen hundred dollars right now.
00:50:54 And I've only I only spent one hundred twenty five on it.
00:50:56 So so that's pretty good.
00:50:58 It's pretty damn good.
00:50:59 And like every time it like hits a peak, I pull one hundred.
00:51:02 So I've already like pulled out like seven hundred dollars of my one hundred twenty
00:51:05 five investment. I still have almost two grand.
00:51:08 So you've so you've made you you're at your net zero, right?
00:51:12 Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, I'm Gucci.
00:51:14 So like it can go it can go to zero now and I'll be upset.
00:51:17 But like I won't have lost anything.
00:51:21 A couple people in my discord were saying a few a few people have made
00:51:24 like a couple grand on Dogecoin.
00:51:26 And I'm like, I hate Dogecoin.
00:51:28 I hate that it's going up.
00:51:29 But like good for them, like good for anyone who isn't like
00:51:34 some fucking Wall Street hedge fund manager or like the board of directors
00:51:38 on some fucking corporate good for anyone who not like that,
00:51:42 who manages to squeeze some money out of it.
00:51:45 Yeah, I know, I know, even though I know
00:51:47 that those people are the main beneficiaries of this kind of thing.
00:51:51 Yeah, I know.
00:51:52 I know Paleo, he put in
00:51:56 money before I did.
00:51:57 I think he's close to making 10 K off Dogecoin right now.
00:52:01 Oh, God, which is insane.
00:52:03 I. I don't know.
00:52:06 I don't know. I I feel like.
00:52:11 Bubbles got a burst at some point, right?
00:52:13 Well, it has to because like they're the reason
00:52:17 like I kind of wish I'd put more money into Ethereum
00:52:19 because I have a little bit of Ethereum that I got for free.
00:52:22 I mean, that's doing like really fucking well
00:52:24 because Ethereum's like doubled in the last month.
00:52:26 But like the reason I've always been bullish about Ethereum
00:52:30 ever since it kind of like became a thing because.
00:52:32 Oh, look at you.
00:52:33 Oh, look at you throwing around fancy terminology bullish.
00:52:37 Oh, oh, it's just a real word.
00:52:38 Oh, excuse me.
00:52:39 I'm bullish on Ethereum.
00:52:41 Oh, well, Ladi Ladi, my dick's been rock hard about Ethereum
00:52:46 ever since I first heard about it because people actually build
00:52:49 like applications on top of it, whereas like Dogecoin's just a meme.
00:52:52 So it's just a meme, but you would have made four hundred thousand dollars.
00:52:56 I know invested in that meme.
00:52:58 Bro, I invested in Ethereum.
00:52:59 I would have made like four hundred million dollars at this point.
00:53:02 What? Not not since the pandemic.
00:53:05 Well, no, no, but like when I first got my first
00:53:07 Ethereum because I have point one six three Ethereum
00:53:10 and I got that in twenty eighteen for free from what's that worth?
00:53:14 Like twenty bucks.
00:53:16 When I got it, it was worth twenty five dollars.
00:53:18 Now it's worth six hundred and fifty.
00:53:20 Wow.
00:53:21 So if I had like actually bought some
00:53:23 ETH back in like twenty eighteen when I first started thinking about it,
00:53:26 I would have had like, I don't know, ten, fifteen thousand dollars in Ethereum.
00:53:33 It hurts, man, hurts my soul.
00:53:34 I mean, yeah.
00:53:37 I mean, if I if I had bought if I had bought a Bitcoin ten years ago,
00:53:41 I would be worth, you know, fifty four thousand dollars right now.
00:53:46 But I mean, it's it's on the one hand, it's super easy to be like hindsight.
00:53:51 You know, I could have done anything.
00:53:52 But like when like you were like right there with your finger over the cursor
00:53:55 and decided no, that's when it really stings.
00:53:58 Yeah. Yeah.
00:54:00 The only good thing I did is that I had half the amount of ETH that I do now.
00:54:04 But because like the way it was done is that M dots always been big into
00:54:07 Ethereum and like crypto and stuff.
00:54:08 He's like big into that shit.
00:54:09 Why do why do you get Ethereum from M dot?
00:54:12 Well, that's what I'm about to explain.
00:54:14 He like had sent for like Christmas, twenty eighteen.
00:54:17 He had like sent a bunch of people like hand drawn postcards like art on them,
00:54:21 just like people in his discord server.
00:54:23 And then he's like, I've put like two digits of like an Ethereum address
00:54:29 on each one of these postcards.
00:54:30 So if you all get into this discord server and solve it and like put the
00:54:34 the number together, you can get this wallet and everyone gets a little bit of
00:54:38 Ethereum. And so we did that.
00:54:39 And then half the people are like, I don't want this Ethereum.
00:54:42 I'm like, oh, give it to me.
00:54:42 I'll take it. I like it.
00:54:44 This is cool.
00:54:45 And so I like doubled my Ethereum from people just not wanting it.
00:54:48 And now it's worth six hundred and fifty dollars.
00:54:50 I'm like, you idiot.
00:54:51 Suckers.
00:54:52 I mean, that's what you got to do.
00:54:56 I guess you just got to step on your fellow man.
00:54:58 You just take whatever you do, whatever means necessary.
00:55:02 Exactly. I'm a good capitalist like that.
00:55:04 I just need Ethereum to get as big as Bitcoin.
00:55:06 And then I'll have like six or seven grand and then I'll feel like a god.
00:55:10 Exactly. I didn't learn anything.
00:55:14 Special guess Applejack today.
00:55:16 That doesn't apply to the situation.
00:55:18 No, it really doesn't.
00:55:19 I just wanted to say it.
00:55:20 That's what the hedge fund managers say when they get bailed out by the government.
00:55:24 I didn't learn anything.
00:55:25 I was right all along.
00:55:27 I was too big to fail all along.
00:55:29 Yee-haw, Sweet Apple Acres is getting subsidized by your tax dollar.
00:55:37 Oh, they fucking they fuck.
00:55:39 Where do you think they took that fucking farm from?
00:55:41 It's an apartheid state.
00:55:42 Ponyville is an apartheid state.
00:55:43 They took it from the native.
00:55:45 I don't know, Windigos or whatever, the native fucking goblins or whatever.
00:55:49 They used to live there before.
00:55:51 Built on zebra labor.
00:55:53 It's disgusting.
00:55:54 Yeah. Yeah.
00:55:56 It is, though.
00:55:57 Sad but true.
00:55:58 Yeah, they had to clear out.
00:56:00 They had to clear out the Everfree Forest.
00:56:01 It used to be a thriving, you know, we turn our nose up.
00:56:04 Oh, we say that all the Everfree Forest is so savage and untamed.
00:56:08 But, you know, the zebras had a thriving society in there before we clear cut it all
00:56:12 to build Sweet Apple Acres.
00:56:15 It was worth it.
00:56:17 That sweet, delicious cider was worth, was worth it.
00:56:20 Worth every drop of zebra blood spilled in the struggle.
00:56:26 Remember how Rainbow Dash was a drunkard?
00:56:31 That was pretty good.
00:56:33 That was pretty good.
00:56:34 What a great show, 10 out of 10.
00:56:36 10 out of 10.
00:56:37 There's still Dr. Wolf, man.
00:56:40 Dr. Wolf is still uploading videos.
00:56:43 What a legend.
00:56:44 He's he's actually, I just happened to look the other day because someone
00:56:48 someone posted in my discord, someone posted Little Shy.
00:56:53 You remember Little Shy?
00:56:54 That's a name that I remember.
00:56:55 Little Shy if I am.
00:56:57 Yes.
00:56:58 He's still posting.
00:56:59 He's still getting like, you know, in like the 10, like the mid 10 K's views.
00:57:04 And Dr. Wolf also still getting in like the like the 10 K's of views.
00:57:09 Lately, he's been posting a lot of like, you know, speculations on the
00:57:13 trailer for the new, the new movie and the new show and stuff.
00:57:16 Yeah, I was about to say they're all biding their time till Gen 5 when they're all
00:57:19 research. Yeah.
00:57:20 And people are still watching.
00:57:22 You know, I mean, good for them, I guess.
00:57:25 Cool.
00:57:25 Oh, good.
00:57:27 Good on you.
00:57:29 You got your thing in this work.
00:57:30 You got your thing in this working for you.
00:57:32 Yeah. Yeah.
00:57:37 Well, Ben, you just got to you just got to market your game towards the pony
00:57:40 fandom that's still active.
00:57:42 I'll have you know that I that I retweeted it on the T-Bap account.
00:57:47 Well, what you really got to do is you got to send it to Seth at Equestria Daily.
00:57:50 That's that's the bump you need.
00:57:51 Honestly, honestly, I think I probably will do that.
00:57:57 I probably will be like, hey, this is I made a pony fan game.
00:58:02 This is a game that I made about my pony OC, my my bro analysis community OC.
00:58:08 From years ago, remember Phantom Horn?
00:58:11 He's back and I made a video game about.
00:58:13 I mean, why not?
00:58:14 Right? Yeah, yeah.
00:58:16 Why just got to like have like the cover art image, just have an unrelated
00:58:19 picture of Trixie for no reason and Seth will click on it for sure.
00:58:24 You mean the pony Trixie the pony, not Trixie.
00:58:26 Right, our associate God, I don't want to put no, no, no.
00:58:30 I've got I've got I've got I've got a vision.
00:58:34 I've got a vision of how I might want the the title screen to look.
00:58:40 But I tried sketching it out and like it looked awkward, considering that I had
00:58:46 to fit like the title and like the like the start options.
00:58:51 So I'm like, I have this really cool idea for a visual image.
00:58:54 But like, I don't know if it can actually squeeze it in to make it
00:58:57 look good and like a man in like a start menu.
00:59:00 Maybe you could just be a little like cinematic image that plays like
00:59:03 when you hit the start button or something.
00:59:05 I don't know.
00:59:06 I don't know.
00:59:07 Or maybe you could play before the menu pops up.
00:59:10 Just got to start doing some thumbnails, put some animatics together,
00:59:12 see how it flows before you commit to the bit.
00:59:14 Yeah, just spend them like a whole a whole month just designing
00:59:17 like the animation for the title screen before I actually get back to making
00:59:20 the game itself. Yeah, you know, whatever.
00:59:23 Fuck it. Take as long as I need.
00:59:24 Why not? Why not just make it a masterpiece?
00:59:27 Yeah, I mean, what's the point of doing something half ass?
00:59:30 Got a whole right?
00:59:31 It's true. It's true.
00:59:32 Got like the whole damn the whole point.
00:59:36 Not the whole point, but like a big part of like my idea for this game
00:59:40 is like this is going to be, you know, it's fairly simple.
00:59:43 It's pretty limited in scope.
00:59:45 It's just like there's no walk around sections.
00:59:48 All it is is just a series of menu driven JRPG battles.
00:59:53 And it's like, just keep the possibility space low.
00:59:56 Just keep, you know, keep the the the amount of things you can do fairly limited.
01:00:01 Limit the possibility space limit the amount of work you have to do.
01:00:04 And like that's true.
01:00:05 I did that and it's true.
01:00:07 It is limited compared to what it could be compared to what I'm sure
01:00:11 a lot of other games are, but it's still taking me months.
01:00:14 It's still taking me month.
01:00:15 Even your solo diving again, like it's super fucking hard.
01:00:19 Like you're doing the right move by keeping it like you're not overscoping,
01:00:23 which is like the death of every indie game.
01:00:25 No, I mean, I mean, I do keep thinking of things to add,
01:00:29 but it's not like big things.
01:00:30 It's just little things like, haha, what if what if I made him burp?
01:00:34 What if I made him burp when he drinks the soda?
01:00:37 Probably the best thing to do is like to come up with like a minimum viable
01:00:41 products, you know, like like just like this are the airline things
01:00:44 that needs to launch and then you can just do post launch updates.
01:00:47 And just that'll be way to keep interest in the game going.
01:00:50 That's kind of what the what the demo was.
01:00:52 Like I released the demo at the point that I was like, this is the minimum
01:00:55 point where I can say I have a game, you can play it.
01:00:59 It doesn't have all the stuff that I want in it because I, you know,
01:01:03 it exists as a vehicle for the story.
01:01:06 And like a lot of the story elements are hard.
01:01:09 And I have only even only just barely started to like add those in.
01:01:15 And those are going to be kind of a hassle.
01:01:18 But, you know, other than that, it's yeah, minimum viable product
01:01:24 is kind of what I was going for with the demo, as well as like, you know,
01:01:29 letting letting people play test it in that form, just to see, did I fuck it up?
01:01:35 And yeah, oh, fuck, where was I?
01:01:42 Was I complaining about making games too hard?
01:01:46 It is pretty hard.
01:01:47 It's too hard.
01:01:48 Even it's too hard.
01:01:50 And even though like I'm doing it baby mode, like doing it in GameMaker,
01:01:54 it's like it's like fucking baby mode.
01:01:56 Like GML is it's like baby pseudo code.
01:01:59 It like couldn't it couldn't be any easier.
01:02:02 I mean, it's not even it's on the one hand, it's like baby mode,
01:02:06 but like it's not really baby mode.
01:02:07 It's like optimized mode because like you can make it in unity,
01:02:10 but like C sharp is a general programming language.
01:02:12 It's not designed to make games.
01:02:14 Like people kind of like is C sharp in unity.
01:02:18 Yeah, unity uses C sharp. OK.
01:02:21 But like GML and GD scripting Godot, they're like proprietary languages,
01:02:25 which kind of suck because they they're not transferable.
01:02:28 Like you only can use them in those applications,
01:02:31 but they're tailored designed to make games with.
01:02:34 So like they're more efficient if you're just trying to make video games.
01:02:37 Yeah. So yeah.
01:02:38 I mean, I mean, I like to think that in a way it's baby mode,
01:02:43 but like it's not like it would it's not like it would improve the product
01:02:47 if I had to like hard code in a function for me to like,
01:02:53 you know, find the square root of a number that so that I can make
01:02:59 a projectile move in an arc, right?
01:03:02 Nobody, nobody at the end of the day cares how you made the game.
01:03:05 They just care that it works, you know?
01:03:07 Yeah, yeah, which is why I always find it funny
01:03:09 because like I was building the vertical slice in a visual scripting language.
01:03:12 I wasn't even doing any coding for that.
01:03:14 And like you'd go look up tutorials for it.
01:03:16 A bunch of people would be like, oh, this is so dumb.
01:03:18 Anybody who does this is an idiot.
01:03:19 Like you'd only have to code and it's just like nobody cares.
01:03:23 Nobody cares that it wasn't hard coded.
01:03:25 They just care if the game's fun.
01:03:26 I when I when I made the champion game,
01:03:31 you know, I started with Game Maker and, you know,
01:03:34 Game Maker comes with this comes with a suite of.
01:03:38 But comes with a suite of, you know, drag and drop functions.
01:03:41 And I started making it using the drag and drop.
01:03:45 But like I regretted it because I realized that like a lot of bugs
01:03:49 that I ended up being really hard to fix just came from the drag and drop
01:03:53 because the drag and drops don't work that cleanly.
01:03:56 For some reason, I just found that they introduced a lot of problems.
01:04:00 That is something and I just ended up I ended up coming away
01:04:04 thinking like the drag and drop game functions are like a noob trap.
01:04:09 That's like it's easier to just it's easier to just write the code
01:04:13 and tell it what to do than to like put these fucking put these fucking
01:04:17 black box drag and drop functions in and make a weird fucking flowchart of them.
01:04:21 Like that's it's just easier.
01:04:23 It's just easier to just write it out in a bunch of if else statements.
01:04:28 Yeah, I think this time I haven't used any of that at all.
01:04:30 And I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't really recommend it.
01:04:33 I think it's just it didn't.
01:04:36 I don't think it ended up saving me like any effort at all
01:04:38 when I tried to use it the first time.
01:04:40 I I kind of disagree.
01:04:43 I feel like visual scripting was a way for me to get into game design
01:04:46 and what is what is visual scripting like like the the drag and drop thing
01:04:50 like you're talking about making game logic without doing actual programming
01:04:53 in in Godot or in anything because there's a bunch of engines that do no code.
01:04:58 Like I used construct three to make the vertical slice
01:05:01 and that's all using an event sheet.
01:05:02 So instead of writing lines of code, you can pick from like pre assigned blocks
01:05:08 that do certain things and it triggers them like downward,
01:05:11 like from top to bottom, it goes through the event sheet.
01:05:14 And you can make make like basic state machines and stuff using those.
01:05:17 And that.
01:05:20 Eventually, I ran into issues where I couldn't figure out.
01:05:23 I think it was more of a me problem than than like the the visual scripting
01:05:27 itself of like getting my states to work properly, like with interacting with enemies.
01:05:31 But that was.
01:05:34 For me, as someone who's much more visual learning,
01:05:36 like being able to like demystify the code and like break it down
01:05:40 into like actual English, it helped me learn a lot of like underlying
01:05:45 programming concepts that when I was reading tutorials for like GD script
01:05:49 and she sharp didn't make any sense.
01:05:51 Like I didn't understand functions until I did them visually.
01:05:54 And then I realized, oh, the the parameters are placeholders
01:05:58 for values you pull when using the function later.
01:06:01 Like I didn't get that when I was reading the GD script documentation
01:06:04 because the documentation on Godot is like really bad.
01:06:06 It just assumes, you know, Python, it's like the documentation is like
01:06:10 it's like Python except this.
01:06:11 And as someone who didn't know Python, I was like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
01:06:15 So I mean, if you're someone who's like predisposed to computer science
01:06:19 in general, just program.
01:06:21 But if you're like afraid of it, I think like having visual scripting
01:06:24 stuff is a good kind of like first step to just like.
01:06:28 Get something done.
01:06:29 I think the most important thing is to get something shipped and out of the door.
01:06:33 And like when you make like your first little baby like pawn game
01:06:36 that might just be like dragging a couple blocks in and it works like it goes
01:06:39 from something you can't do to something you can do.
01:06:42 And I think that's a huge, big, important first step.
01:06:44 Did you did you do any like math in college?
01:06:50 No, no, no, maybe maybe that's the difference.
01:06:54 Because I mean, I didn't even do like like advanced high school math.
01:06:58 Like I was so dumb at math.
01:07:01 Oh, you're just not you're just not a math guy at all.
01:07:04 Not at all.
01:07:05 I mean, maybe that's the difference because like I, you know, I got my physics degree
01:07:09 and I had to take a bunch of like I had to take a bunch of like semi advanced math
01:07:12 and stuff, maybe, you know, I mean, writing in GML is just it's a lot of like
01:07:18 it's not math, but it's, you know, you you put a you take a function
01:07:22 and you put the operand in the fucking brackets and then the operator operates
01:07:27 on it and then it, you know, iterates on it in a sort of math like way.
01:07:31 And I don't know, maybe I just find that maybe I'm just kind of practiced
01:07:35 at the at the sort of thinking that, you know, writing code in that way demands.
01:07:41 Yeah, I mean, now that I've done like a lot of visual scripting stuff,
01:07:44 like I can look at code and understand much better what it's doing.
01:07:49 Because it's just like it's just being able to translate.
01:07:51 It's like any other language being able to understand like what the basic kind
01:07:55 of linguistic functions of it are for lack of a better term.
01:07:58 You know, like once you know what an FL statement is, you can look at code
01:08:01 and be like, oh, I understand what's going on there.
01:08:03 Whereas before you'd be like, what the fuck does this mean?
01:08:06 Yeah, it's all good.
01:08:09 It's all about finding the right tool for your skill set.
01:08:12 Sure. I mean, whatever, whatever.
01:08:14 At the end of the day, it's whatever works.
01:08:15 I just I just found that I went in to Game Aper being like make her being like,
01:08:20 oh, I'm so glad I don't need to learn code
01:08:24 because I have these drag and drop functions.
01:08:25 And I and I left thinking like, why not even bother with the drag and drop functions?
01:08:29 The code is like not significantly more difficult to understand.
01:08:34 At least that was that was my experience with it.
01:08:37 Sure. But I guess I guess my point is just that, like,
01:08:40 if the drag and drop thing wasn't there,
01:08:42 which you've ever made a game in the first place, you know,
01:08:44 it's it's that breaking down to the barrier that's really helpful.
01:08:47 You know, you know, I turn my nose about it now.
01:08:52 But at the same time, yeah, there there must have been a period
01:08:55 where I was dragging and dropping.
01:08:56 And then I was because like you can take a drag and drop function
01:08:59 and then you can say like, OK, actually, just show me the code.
01:09:05 Just convert this drag and drop block into raw code.
01:09:09 And it will just turn it into code into a block of code for you.
01:09:12 And you can look at it and edit it as you want.
01:09:14 And you can like see what's in it that made it do the thing.
01:09:17 So, yeah, actually, I probably did go through a bit of like
01:09:22 a transitionary period where and I come to understand what is going on
01:09:26 inside the blocks, open them up and look around inside them and go, Oh, I see.
01:09:31 Well, all I really need is this.
01:09:32 So I could just take this and put this over here and instead,
01:09:36 and instead of all this other stuff that's in here or whatever.
01:09:39 And yeah. And then I'm like, OK, so now I know how to do it
01:09:44 without the blocks, but like I built it with the blocks in the first place
01:09:48 that kind of got me there. That's probably true.
01:09:50 Yeah. And now that you mentioned it.
01:09:54 Yep. Make it.
01:09:57 Hey, there are my headphones dead again.
01:09:58 Oh, OK, hello.
01:10:02 Charge the fucking battery, Ben.
01:10:03 I. You're right.
01:10:06 You're absolutely right.
01:10:07 Or just use wired headphones.
01:10:08 You're on your desktop.
01:10:09 What do you need wireless for?
01:10:11 Um, I just my wireless are my best ones.
01:10:15 They don't have like a oxport you just plug a cable into.
01:10:19 They not I am not like a signal cable.
01:10:22 They have a plug that they can charge with.
01:10:24 Oof. No, they don't.
01:10:26 They don't have a signal cable.
01:10:27 Brutal.
01:10:28 I forgot to mention I want I mentioned that this week I had.
01:10:34 I had the run in Noida and I just want to mention
01:10:39 that I had my nukes.
01:10:41 I had all my immunities.
01:10:43 I was a complete God.
01:10:44 I was running around nuking entire biomes,
01:10:47 raining gold, so much gold on me that it crashed the game.
01:10:51 And I just died fucking around with wands.
01:10:54 I just died fucking around with my wands
01:10:56 and like shot myself with a bullet that killed me by accident.
01:11:01 It was I will I will try not to go too much into detail about it
01:11:06 because I could explain it all day.
01:11:08 But the short version is I was using modifiers
01:11:12 that add extra damage at the cost of making the bullet deadly to you.
01:11:17 But I was further modifying them with a
01:11:21 another thing that makes they the bullet the projectiles lifetime equal to zero.
01:11:26 So it doesn't travel at all and it can't hit you.
01:11:29 Long story short, I took off that
01:11:33 no no lifetime thing that makes the projectiles disappear.
01:11:37 So the projectiles were, in fact, flying around and I fired a shot
01:11:41 and the bullets whizzed all around and I was like, oh, wow,
01:11:44 those are like incredibly deadly.
01:11:46 If any of those had hit me, I'd have been fucking dead.
01:11:48 Ha ha. And then I shot it again and they killed me.
01:11:53 And I was like, why didn't I just not do that?
01:11:57 Why didn't I simply not do it?
01:12:00 I was fate telling you to start working on your game again.
01:12:02 You know, honestly, that's how it is now.
01:12:05 I'll get on.
01:12:06 If I boot up Noida and I have a good run, a good run takes a long time.
01:12:10 I'll be playing it for like several hours and I'll be like, yes, this is the run.
01:12:14 This is the run.
01:12:15 And then I die in a stupid way.
01:12:17 But I'm just like, you know what?
01:12:18 Good, I shouldn't play anymore, Noida.
01:12:21 I'm free now.
01:12:23 You've said that multiple times, though, and you keep dragging yourself back to Noida.
01:12:27 Please forgive me, baby.
01:12:28 I'm sorry. I just shout on you in the procrastinators podcast.
01:12:31 Just one more run.
01:12:32 It'll be different this time.
01:12:35 But it's never. But it's never different.
01:12:37 No, this no, no, no, baby.
01:12:40 This time, I promise you'll get explosion immunity and fire resistance
01:12:43 and glass cannon and nukes this time.
01:12:46 This will be the run. This will be the run.
01:12:49 But it's never the run.
01:12:50 That one could have been the run.
01:12:53 Whatever, I I I I met the goal.
01:12:56 I met the goal that I wanted, which was seeing what it's like to fire a nuke
01:13:01 with glass cannon and survive.
01:13:03 And it was I mean, I I already told you about the gold.
01:13:07 I don't need to explain.
01:13:08 I don't need to explain how glorious it was.
01:13:11 What more can you what more can you ask for?
01:13:15 I guess it's finally time to move on to another game.
01:13:19 No, no, no, no, no, no.
01:13:27 You know, it's a little thing about Noida is that like
01:13:31 as a run goes on, I always eventually find myself
01:13:35 gravitating towards the same kind of bill in the same way that like all life
01:13:39 forms will eventually evolve to resemble a crab.
01:13:43 Every every Noida game eventually evolves so that I have my main damage
01:13:48 wand, which shoots one bullet, which then explodes into lots of tiny bullets
01:13:52 that have huge damage modifiers on.
01:13:54 That's my damage dealer.
01:13:56 And then I have a teleport wand that shoots little short teleport bolts
01:13:59 that go so I can go really fast across the map.
01:14:02 And then I have a third one that shoots a bunch of black holes
01:14:05 infinitely that can dig me through any terrain I want to go.
01:14:08 And then the third one is just whatever else I fucking feel like carrying
01:14:12 because it's just those three.
01:14:13 Those are the three things.
01:14:14 Huge damage, teleport really fast, dig through anything with infinite black holes.
01:14:19 And that's all you need.
01:14:20 So, you know, in a long enough time frame, every Noida game kind of ends up
01:14:24 looking the same, if I'm being perfectly honest with myself, which I always am.
01:14:29 It's good. Yeah, sad, but true.
01:14:34 People were trying to get me to play Isaac.
01:14:39 I don't know.
01:14:40 I don't know. I want to go back to classic.
01:14:43 I mean, I used to be really into it.
01:14:45 I played a lot of it back in like twenty fifteen or so, fourteen.
01:14:51 They were just like an updated version, didn't they?
01:14:53 Yeah, people were telling I think pretty recently they did.
01:14:56 And apparently like people really like it and it's got a lot of stuff in it and like.
01:15:03 But I mean, I feel like I had my fun with Isaac years ago.
01:15:07 I don't know if I want to do it again.
01:15:10 Well, it's always there. Time to I know it's I know it's a good game.
01:15:15 It's a fun game. I like it.
01:15:18 But do I do I need it, though?
01:15:20 What will it do when needs video games?
01:15:24 Nobody needs video games, except for our video games.
01:15:27 Those ones you need pre-order now.
01:15:29 People need Phantom's Revenge.
01:15:31 Yes, the the Brony community needs the shot in the arm.
01:15:34 That will will be the Phantom's Revenge.
01:15:36 Just going to split the fan between between Gen five and Phantom's Revenge.
01:15:41 The two camps.
01:15:45 I maybe I'll it would be really funny to like.
01:15:49 Phantom's Revenge comes out.
01:15:50 It's a huge hit.
01:15:52 It shatters the glass ceiling.
01:15:53 It transcends the boundaries between YouTube and My Little Pony
01:15:58 and and whatever the fuck else.
01:16:02 And it's like it's it's a smash hit.
01:16:05 It makes me a million dollars.
01:16:06 And then I'm like, damn, got to make a sequel.
01:16:08 So I just take the engine and I just kind of build a sequel.
01:16:11 That's like the same game.
01:16:13 But I don't know.
01:16:14 I'll just set it and I'll just set it in the world of Gen five.
01:16:17 I'll just have Phantom killing a bunch of like the Gen five ponies or something.
01:16:21 You know, that'd be good idea.
01:16:23 Can you imagine that actually happens and then the peak,
01:16:26 the procrastinators podcast comments section just full of bronies
01:16:29 and like we come full circle.
01:16:30 Could you?
01:16:32 We have to go back.
01:16:34 We've been saying it for years.
01:16:35 We have to. This is it.
01:16:36 This is our ticket, our ticket back into the limelight.
01:16:40 If G five does well.
01:16:41 Horace return, we have to go to Brony Con again.
01:16:45 God, I wonder.
01:16:48 Right.
01:16:48 Somebody, somebody must own the rights to the name.
01:16:52 Brony Con, right?
01:16:53 Like somebody would have to either the owner of that IP.
01:16:58 But do you think someone owns that name?
01:17:00 They have to, right?
01:17:01 There's no way they just let that lapse.
01:17:03 Because if not, Radcon six, Brony Con is happening.
01:17:06 I.
01:17:10 Well, I don't know.
01:17:11 Do you think maybe it's too generic a name to be copyrighted?
01:17:18 I don't know.
01:17:19 If no, if nobody owns that name, I would say that, like,
01:17:24 probably a gen five will see a return of Brony Con.
01:17:28 If it is like a trademark name, then I still think it's pretty likely.
01:17:32 We'll return in spirit, if nothing else.
01:17:35 There will be another big convention.
01:17:37 I would think that at that point, whoever owns the copyright
01:17:40 could just sell it to somebody who wants to make do another one.
01:17:44 That would be a good move.
01:17:45 I don't see why you wouldn't do that.
01:17:47 But yeah, even if it's called something else, honestly.
01:17:51 Yeah, I bet it will.
01:17:52 I bet it will, because it's looking at little shy F.I.M.
01:17:56 and Dr. Wolfe, like the audience is still there.
01:18:00 I'm sure it's not what it was at the height of the Brony craze.
01:18:03 But there's still an audience for my little pony content.
01:18:07 Look, and a lot of it is the old audience.
01:18:09 We need to get in on the ground floor if Gen five starts doing well.
01:18:13 We don't have to change anything.
01:18:15 We just have to have every week we're talking about the new episode
01:18:18 and the PCP becomes the the the pony consuming podcast.
01:18:23 And we just kind of just don't even mention anything.
01:18:26 It just it just kind of happens.
01:18:29 God, you know what?
01:18:30 I'm fucking I'm fucking ready.
01:18:32 I'm fucking ready to just be a fucking pony tuber again.
01:18:34 Just take me back.
01:18:35 Just take me back to the simpler time.
01:18:37 I'm not kidding.
01:18:38 You laugh, but I'm totally serious.
01:18:40 I'm better times.
01:18:41 It was fun.
01:18:42 I there are times when I do miss it.
01:18:45 I was all it was all it was all fun and games back then.
01:18:49 Oh, I didn't get my closure.
01:18:50 I didn't even get to go to the last Brony con.
01:18:52 It's a it's a hole in my heart that will never heal.
01:18:56 Why didn't you go to the last bro?
01:18:57 Oh, because you were sick.
01:18:58 Or are you not sick?
01:18:59 You had him.
01:19:00 He had mobility issues.
01:19:02 Yeah, I was still waiting to get my surgery back then.
01:19:04 Right.
01:19:05 No pun intended.
01:19:10 No, you know what?
01:19:11 I think there will be another Brony con.
01:19:14 I think I think it'll and I'll be I'll be curious if it's like
01:19:20 half the size of the old ones or if it's like really small,
01:19:25 like not even like enough to be in like a con.
01:19:28 Or I mean, or maybe it would just be.
01:19:31 I guess the alternative is that it just becomes subsumed by furry conventions.
01:19:36 Yeah, maybe, I guess.
01:19:40 It might just might just become a facet of furry.
01:19:43 The fandom's still alive.
01:19:44 There are people who like I still follow some pony artists
01:19:46 and they're making their shit.
01:19:49 Yeah, but I mean, I don't know.
01:19:52 I guess I could just see like if it doesn't.
01:19:55 Unless there's like a real resurgence of the Brony culture, like it depends
01:20:01 on how well Gen five does, I guess, unless there's a real deal.
01:20:05 Yeah, if it's not a big deal, I feel like the natural thing
01:20:09 for bronies is just to become a subset of furries.
01:20:12 Yeah, become the diet furries.
01:20:14 They were always accused of being.
01:20:16 Yeah, exact.
01:20:17 Exactly.
01:20:19 I didn't learn anything.
01:20:25 Oh, I got to.
01:20:29 I have something funny happen.
01:20:30 So did you have you heard me talk about the the Cato anthology that is seen?
01:20:37 Mentioned, but I don't know anything about it.
01:20:39 Well, yeah, they were they were a comics anthology that's going to they're
01:20:43 going to do a Kickstarter in this pretty soon.
01:20:47 Actually, shit, the Kickstarter might even be running by the time
01:20:50 this episode comes out or like pretty close.
01:20:53 Yeah, and they last month, they were looking for submissions.
01:20:56 I think submissions are closed now, but they they they asked me if they could
01:21:01 publish The White Lion, which is like, you know, that'll that'll
01:21:06 chestnut. And I was like, sure, yeah, we can put that in if you want that.
01:21:12 And I they they asked me like, you know, for the files.
01:21:18 And I was like, OK, sure, I'll get you the the image files.
01:21:21 And I was looking through my computer and I could only find the ones
01:21:26 that I have that are saved at website size.
01:21:29 So like 900 pixels across as in like completely inadequate for print.
01:21:35 And so I'm like, well, fuck.
01:21:38 So I had to dig up the originals, which I happened to have in my closet here.
01:21:43 I dug up the original like drawn versions, the inked pages of White Lion.
01:21:49 And I am going to rescan them at high res.
01:21:53 And so I will be giving the Cato anthology the like
01:21:57 I guess the the the the HD remasters.
01:22:01 It'll be the HD remasters of the White Lion.
01:22:03 It'll be never never before printed, never before seen anywhere.
01:22:06 They will be making their their debut in one point five remix.
01:22:12 Yes. Three three eighty six over two pages.
01:22:18 Key key blade, whatever.
01:22:22 Yeah, yeah, like that.
01:22:25 Yeah, the the White Lion remaster.
01:22:29 I should I should make a new like title page.
01:22:31 Just says White Lion remastered just because it's funny.
01:22:37 I don't know, maybe.
01:22:38 But yes, that's going to be that's going to be in that book.
01:22:42 And they're going to do.
01:22:44 Yeah, I think they said they're starting the the Kickstarter on the 14th,
01:22:49 which is only five days from recording this.
01:22:53 And I got to fucking draw a cover for them.
01:22:56 I told they asked me to draw the cover for the that, which I said I would do.
01:23:00 And so I must do it soon.
01:23:05 This is just that's just another I didn't even get to do any of that.
01:23:09 This week, but that was just like the other stuff that I had to do for that
01:23:12 was just another thing like this this week went by.
01:23:16 Faster than usual, I really feel like only like.
01:23:20 I feel like we just recorded the last episode.
01:23:21 It actually really freaked me out.
01:23:23 Well, like yesterday when I was I'm like, oh my god, it's Sunday tomorrow already.
01:23:28 We just recorded.
01:23:29 We just recorded an episode.
01:23:31 What the hell?
01:23:32 It like it actually kind of upset me because it's like it's a very strange
01:23:35 feeling when it felt just like what did I even do?
01:23:38 And you start having like a minor kind of like freak out.
01:23:40 You're just like, so what would happen yesterday?
01:23:42 What I do the day before that?
01:23:43 And what about the day before that?
01:23:44 What where did it all go?
01:23:46 Yeah, I got it real bad this week.
01:23:48 I got it particularly bad.
01:23:51 Mm, mm, yeah.
01:23:54 But what can you do?
01:23:57 That's life.
01:23:58 And they say, you know, every time the older you get, the older you get,
01:24:04 the smaller a fraction of your like your total experienced time is like.
01:24:11 Yeah, you're like relative perception of time gets faster because like every day
01:24:17 your your total life being alive is longer.
01:24:20 So each day is like a fraction smaller.
01:24:23 When you're when you're 10 a year is 10% of your entire life.
01:24:27 And when you when you're 50 a year is 2% of your entire life.
01:24:32 So there you go.
01:24:34 I don't know the worst, the worst, terrible, terrible, awful nightmare.
01:24:40 Nightmare world we live in.
01:24:42 Yeah.
01:24:45 What do you think about voicemails?
01:24:48 It's the part I've been dreading this entire hour and 20 minutes.
01:24:53 We last episode, we did two hours of voicemails.
01:24:57 I don't want to hear that.
01:24:59 There's no way.
01:25:01 I don't know how much of a penalty do I take if I leave early?
01:25:06 We we have a formula.
01:25:12 Oh, God, no, we can't surely surely we won't do that again.
01:25:18 Surely because last time we scolded everyone and we told them, hey,
01:25:22 script your voicemails.
01:25:23 Don't just ramble like, like, I just kind of think like,
01:25:29 so surely these will all be succinct and to the point and not annoying.
01:25:33 Our audience always listens to us.
01:25:36 They are.
01:25:38 Cherubs, absolute cherubs, every single one.
01:25:41 We have a page and a half, a page and a half, which is about that's normal.
01:25:46 OK, let's do it.
01:25:48 No, no, bullet, bullet time of bullet round.
01:25:52 First one is called Dead Leaves.
01:25:55 Three, two, one, go.
01:25:58 Hey, Ben, you should check out Dead Leaves, if you haven't already.
01:26:00 It's a 2004 anime by Hiroyuki Yamaishi.
01:26:03 It is 45 minutes of constant frenetic action and they shoot a ton of cops.
01:26:07 You probably enjoy it.
01:26:10 I think I've seen it.
01:26:12 It sounds cool.
01:26:14 It's not a big ask.
01:26:16 It's the one with the guy with the TV head, right?
01:26:20 The one guy's got a TV head.
01:26:22 I think I've seen it.
01:26:25 Uh, and I think it was cool.
01:26:28 I don't honestly don't remember.
01:26:30 Thanks for the recommendation.
01:26:32 Sounds cool.
01:26:33 I'm going to check it out.
01:26:35 If you if you Google it, you'll you'll recognize what it looks like.
01:26:39 It's the guy with the TV head.
01:26:42 That's that's what I think of.
01:26:45 It doesn't look that it doesn't look like it should be called Dead Leaves.
01:26:49 I don't know why it's called.
01:26:50 I searched dead leaves and I just got dead leaves like leaves on the ground.
01:26:54 No, you got to go dead leaves anime.
01:26:58 Yeah, now I'm seeing it.
01:27:00 Yeah, yeah, there it is.
01:27:01 This is a trigger thing.
01:27:02 It looks very trigger.
01:27:03 I don't think it is trigger, but it does look very.
01:27:07 They're definitely trigger inspired.
01:27:09 Yeah.
01:27:11 OK, next voicemail is called The Digital Indra three two one go.
01:27:17 Hello, I just wanted to say I've been a long time listener of the podcast.
01:27:22 And by a long time listener, I mean, I've listened to probably about 10 episodes
01:27:27 and figured so many.
01:27:28 That's like 30 hours.
01:27:29 I'm in on all the jokes now.
01:27:32 Anywho just wanted to let you know I'm seizing the means of production
01:27:36 and producing my own podcast.
01:27:39 No, you can't do that.
01:27:40 And hookers.
01:27:41 You can't do that.
01:27:42 You're not allowed to do that.
01:27:43 So that's basically a keep on keeping on.
01:27:48 Return the scrolls, Ben, and Tom will never die.
01:27:53 Keep it sleazy, bitches.
01:27:55 What was the point of this voicemail
01:27:58 that we've inspired him to create content?
01:28:01 I don't care.
01:28:04 Well, I'm happy.
01:28:06 I was I was I was going to be annoyed
01:28:08 because I thought he was just going to plug his own podcast.
01:28:12 But then he didn't plug his own podcast.
01:28:14 So I'm like, OK, well, I guess I shouldn't be mad.
01:28:16 But then well, if he's not going to shamelessly plug himself,
01:28:19 then what was the point?
01:28:20 It was it was a point.
01:28:22 Thirty nine seconds.
01:28:23 I'll never get back. Oh, God.
01:28:27 Do you think I'm proud?
01:28:28 Do you think I'm proud to think that there are more podcasts
01:28:31 out there in the world because of me? No.
01:28:34 No, I'm ashamed.
01:28:35 I do. I've done harm.
01:28:39 You're not making pony fan games.
01:28:41 You're not using your time correctly.
01:28:42 No, no, you do as I do, not as I say.
01:28:49 Next next voicemail is called.
01:28:51 Oh, God, it's a minute, thirteen.
01:28:53 It better be worth it.
01:28:54 It's called Super Volteca. Three, two, one, go.
01:28:58 So, guys, how would you feel of all the kick
01:29:02 starters that the PCP made over the years?
01:29:05 Ended up being featured on an episode of Six Gamers.
01:29:08 Now, for those who don't know, Six Gamers,
01:29:10 this is a great series on YouTube posted by this guy named DJ Slope.
01:29:16 He's also like a frequent collaborator with Guru Larry.
01:29:19 I feel like I've already gotten the gist of the question now.
01:29:22 Well, you see, Six Gamers is a show where he covers some of the oddest,
01:29:26 stupidest and most dreadful, crowdfunding campaigns to ever grace
01:29:30 this invisible hellscape that we're forced to call Earth.
01:29:33 I ask this because, you know, the shit that Tritsey has done
01:29:37 is about you and the fans, whether it be the BronyCon lecture
01:29:41 or those curses that you leave in the V-blue rays.
01:29:45 You know, that would be something for Perfect for either an episode
01:29:47 about like five terrible podcasts or like a kickstarter.
01:29:52 Hell, you know, Tritsey herself would be an ideal subject alone
01:29:56 when it comes to like, I don't know, five shitty anime related kickstarters.
01:30:01 You know, I bet Slope would get a fucking kick out of her
01:30:04 messed up history and all the drama shit.
01:30:06 So, yeah, what do you guys think?
01:30:10 All the OK, he starts the voicemail by saying,
01:30:13 how would you feel if all the kickstarters that the PCP made over the years
01:30:18 went on this, whatever, this like kick scammers thing or whatever?
01:30:23 Um, well, uh, none.
01:30:27 First of all, none of none of the PCP kickstarters
01:30:30 have failed to deliver on anything, except for unless you count Radcon four.
01:30:35 But we are still delivering on that.
01:30:37 So that one is that one is incoming.
01:30:39 So none of those none of those qualify.
01:30:43 The Tritsey stuff.
01:30:44 I mean, yeah, Tritsey did kind of fail to deliver on some kickstarter promises.
01:30:50 I don't know if it rises to the level of like a like a like a hilarious
01:30:57 scandal or anything. Yeah, I don't know.
01:31:00 I mean, I don't know if it, yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah.
01:31:06 And then, I mean, I mean,
01:31:09 and then he goes off on a tangent about, I mean, would be funny
01:31:13 because Tritsey is weird in other ways and like, yeah, true, but not
01:31:18 the kickstarters are not because the kickstarters.
01:31:21 The kickstarters are a small footnote in that history of I would, I would agree.
01:31:25 Yeah, I would agree.
01:31:27 So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:31:31 Next voicemail, Alaskan Weeb, three, two, one, go.
01:31:37 Ben St.
01:31:38 You pawns, you fool, you rude, you simple capitalist overloads.
01:31:41 The whole reason that you can fire somebody for failing to prevent a shop
01:31:45 lifter while also allowing them from preventing shoplifting in the first place
01:31:48 is so that you can discriminate against people who otherwise are perfectly
01:31:52 acceptable employees. You can't fire someone for being gay.
01:31:54 You can't fire someone for being trans.
01:31:56 You can't fire someone for being non-binary, but you can fire them
01:31:58 for failing to prevent someone from shoplifting.
01:32:00 And that's how you fire people, how you discriminate against those people.
01:32:03 That's why that loss still remains.
01:32:06 Well, I.
01:32:11 I feel like you could fire someone.
01:32:12 You could make up any fucking reason you want to fire someone if they're gay
01:32:17 and you just don't like them.
01:32:18 Yeah, you can't say I'm firing because you're gay, but you can say like,
01:32:22 you know, you're you're I don't know, you're lazy.
01:32:24 You were you were five minutes late today and you're late.
01:32:28 You don't do your duties, you know, the you don't get along with it.
01:32:31 You could you could make up whatever fucking reason you want.
01:32:33 And like, yeah, sure, failed to prevent a shoplifter is could be one of them, I guess.
01:32:38 Uh.
01:32:41 Yeah, maybe it's I'm sure in some places it would be a perfectly reasonable.
01:32:46 I mean, you don't always even have to give a reason why you're firing someone, right?
01:32:50 Like, that's I think that's state by state.
01:32:52 And I don't think every state requires that an employer like specifically tell you why
01:32:57 maybe they do fucked up, but it would be it's kind of fucked up.
01:33:00 Yeah.
01:33:02 Do the next voicemail.
01:33:05 Oh, God, I'm going to have to hear my own voice on the episode three, two, one, go.
01:33:11 OK, I go to make a shitpost, like take take the garbage yelling thing
01:33:16 and pretend it's about the egg.
01:33:17 But no, no, OK, I go on to Trixie's Twitter and she posted tech talk where it's
01:33:23 it's literally her just just reviewing rest stops.
01:33:28 Why isn't Riley stopping her?
01:33:30 Doesn't Riley want want to make sure that nobody gets
01:33:34 they don't get docs and no one calls the police whenever,
01:33:37 whenever they're straight up saying what rest carriers they're at.
01:33:41 Why post them later?
01:33:43 She posted why they're already gone.
01:33:45 I thought you didn't want to show the RV so people could call it.
01:33:51 Why?
01:33:53 OK, this is what's passed to me later after they've already left.
01:33:57 So it's not it's not docs worthy.
01:34:00 I I just want to say funny, funny thing, funny thing that happened this week.
01:34:06 Just got to mention it is I actually caught Riley in the comments
01:34:12 of the video claiming to have an RV when they don't have an RV.
01:34:18 He straight up said or someone said RV and he said, oh, no,
01:34:23 this video was before the RV.
01:34:25 This was before we got the RV when they don't have an RV.
01:34:29 He's straight up just lying about it and it's so fucking funny.
01:34:33 OK, I'm sorry.
01:34:34 It's tangent. It's not important.
01:34:36 It says whatever. It's just that's for me.
01:34:40 Next voicemail is called Apologies, Benjamin and Gibb for two in a row.
01:34:46 This one's short.
01:34:47 Thank you. Three, two, one, go.
01:34:50 Also, in one of them, she's in a car.
01:34:54 She might just be taking the car and then sleep in the RV.
01:34:57 But there's no RV.
01:34:58 That would mean the RV exists and it doesn't.
01:35:02 Just so there's no RV.
01:35:04 It's the same car.
01:35:05 It's the same car that they've used in all the previous road trips.
01:35:08 You can tell because it has a telltale crack in the windshield.
01:35:13 And it's been there the whole time.
01:35:14 So that's fun fact.
01:35:17 There's some deep lord of this already.
01:35:19 I've been I've been away for a few weeks and there's all sorts of layers
01:35:22 that I didn't even know.
01:35:23 Internet, internet, internet sleuths,
01:35:25 internet sleuths have cracked this case wide open.
01:35:29 Much like the windshield.
01:35:31 Got up, got a plug, got a plug.
01:35:33 And, you know, if there were any doubt about whether the RV exists,
01:35:36 all you have to do is go to isthereanrv.com and you can have it answered.
01:35:42 And you will always you will be up to date on the answer to that question
01:35:46 at all times.
01:35:48 We've got you covered.
01:35:51 Next voicemail is called Frost Drive.
01:35:55 Three, two, one, go.
01:35:57 Gip and Ben and Tom, you guys really like video game commentators.
01:36:04 YouTubers that talk about video games.
01:36:05 I do. I'm ashamed of it, but I do.
01:36:07 There's a YouTuber I know who's virtually unknown.
01:36:10 His name is Ray R. Reviewing and his videos are really insane.
01:36:15 I think you guys would like him.
01:36:16 He even has puppets in his show and everything.
01:36:19 And it's oh, it's so good.
01:36:21 Some videos are an hour plus long and it's amazing.
01:36:25 If you like video game commentators, check out Ray R.
01:36:28 Reviewing, maybe talk about him on the show because that'd be pretty cool.
01:36:32 But if not, I mean, at least check him out.
01:36:34 Ray R. Reviewing.
01:36:37 Let's see.
01:36:38 All like all one word Ray R.
01:36:43 Like the word R.
01:36:45 Do you think this is his YouTube channel?
01:36:49 No, I don't think so.
01:36:50 Frost Drive has his own YouTube channel.
01:36:56 That'd be pretty funny.
01:36:57 It'd be a good bit.
01:36:58 It'd be a good joke.
01:36:59 Ray.
01:37:03 Let's see.
01:37:04 A filter by channel.
01:37:09 When I search Ray R.
01:37:10 OK, I'm searching Ray and the space, the letter R, space,
01:37:14 reviewing and the first result is Dame Drops.
01:37:19 Is it supposed to be like Ray R as an A R E reviewing?
01:37:22 I'm searching that I tried searching for that, too.
01:37:25 And I didn't get it.
01:37:27 Now, let's see filters channel.
01:37:31 I get one called Ray reviews and it's a puppet.
01:37:37 Ray reviews now.
01:37:39 That's not it.
01:37:41 Maybe maybe no spaces.
01:37:43 Yeah, I'm doing those spaces right now.
01:37:45 Maybe.
01:37:48 OK, I think I found it.
01:37:52 I think I found it.
01:37:55 And it's like a guy with like a purple mask.
01:37:59 And it's all one word, R A Y A R E reviewing 837 subscribers.
01:38:06 I don't know.
01:38:08 Fuck it.
01:38:09 I'll give I'll give one of these videos a watch later.
01:38:12 Why not?
01:38:13 Why not?
01:38:15 I'm watching a bullshit.
01:38:19 Oh, he's got a real mask.
01:38:20 He's got a mask in real.
01:38:21 Oh, he's costumed.
01:38:22 Oh, he does costumes.
01:38:24 Oh, that's nice.
01:38:25 Oh, that's good.
01:38:27 It's gonna be really cool when it's in my other tab,
01:38:29 not being viewed as I just listened to it.
01:38:32 But I appreciate the production value regardless.
01:38:35 Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
01:38:38 Next voicemail is called YoyyTuber.
01:38:41 Three, two, one, go.
01:38:43 Also, sorry, I'm not that YouTuber girl.
01:38:46 Sorry.
01:38:47 Also, please, please, please watch.
01:38:49 Also, please watch.
01:38:50 Odd Taxi, please, please, please, please, please.
01:38:55 I am watching Odd Taxi last last week.
01:38:57 Someone I think the same person told us to watch Odd Taxi.
01:39:01 You've seen it.
01:39:01 I think I'm tweeting about it.
01:39:03 Right. I am watching Odd Taxi.
01:39:04 It's very good.
01:39:06 I like it.
01:39:07 Oh, wait, someone.
01:39:08 They said. OK.
01:39:09 They said like, oh, yeah.
01:39:10 Odd Taxi is about like a world of animals
01:39:13 and there's like a bear or a hippopotamus
01:39:17 or something who drives a taxi and there's a murder mystery.
01:39:20 And I was like, Snore sounds shit.
01:39:23 Sounds dumb.
01:39:25 Sounds bad. It's pretty good.
01:39:26 It's pretty good.
01:39:27 It's it's like a it's kind of like a slice of life thing,
01:39:30 but it's like kind of esoteric in that like the guy drives a taxi.
01:39:34 So like he's just doing his job driving his taxi
01:39:38 and people get in the cab and like have conversation with them
01:39:41 and then they go back out.
01:39:42 But all these characters that are coming in and out of his cab
01:39:44 are called part of this like bigger interconnected kind of murder mystery thing.
01:39:48 And it's some of the storytelling kind of synchronous.
01:39:51 So characters who come into the cab in one episode,
01:39:53 you'll get their backstory later and see what brought them to getting into the cab
01:39:57 and having that conversation.
01:39:59 And there's like some bigger
01:40:00 meta narrative with a lot of other characters.
01:40:02 And like everything's kind of like coalescing
01:40:03 and like all these characters that seem unrelated to each other
01:40:06 kind of cross paths with each other.
01:40:08 And like there's a bigger interconnected story
01:40:10 that's slowly coming into focus as each episode continues.
01:40:13 It's really cool.
01:40:14 It feels it feels like there's like a world happening
01:40:17 because all these characters are doing things and following their own goals.
01:40:21 But it's happenstance that brings them together rather than like
01:40:24 a kind of like more blatant kind of like schlocky plot.
01:40:29 It's just like they're just doing their own lives.
01:40:31 And and they're just getting into this cab and talking to this one guy
01:40:34 is like the thread that like starts connecting them
01:40:37 and like bringing them close together.
01:40:38 It's pretty cool. I recommend it.
01:40:40 Hmm. OK.
01:40:43 All right.
01:40:44 Listen, I'm here.
01:40:45 Yeah, I feel you down with this.
01:40:48 I'm down with picking up what you're throwing down, dog.
01:40:50 OK. It makes sense. Sounds good.
01:40:52 All right.
01:40:54 Prize. I probably won't watch it.
01:40:56 But I don't know.
01:40:59 I'll watch the two hour YouTube man,
01:41:01 but not a twenty three minute episode.
01:41:03 Absolutely, because I can fucking draw sprites.
01:41:07 I can draw sprites while I listen to YouTube puppet man.
01:41:12 Only we knew Japanese.
01:41:16 I mean, well, I mean, you got to watch a show.
01:41:20 I don't know. I can't like some some bullshit on YouTube.
01:41:23 Some guy talking about video games.
01:41:25 I can just listen and I don't have to look at it.
01:41:27 A guy, a show, though, like a cartoon, like you got to you got to watch that.
01:41:31 OK, then if you have to watch it, what's the problem with it?
01:41:35 Not being you're not going to watch another tab anyway.
01:41:37 So just like put aside 20 minutes and watch it.
01:41:40 But I don't want to put those 20 minutes aside.
01:41:43 I want to make sprites.
01:41:44 I want to play Noida for 600 hours.
01:41:47 Yes, I want to if.
01:41:49 And that's that's my Noida time.
01:41:51 That's my Noida time.
01:41:52 And I can't it can't sacrifice any of it.
01:41:57 Well, I can argue with that.
01:41:59 I can and I do listen to YouTube video game man while I play Noida.
01:42:03 That's like my favorite thing to do is those two things at the same time.
01:42:07 That's that's it for me.
01:42:09 That's that's that's all I need.
01:42:11 Playing video games while listening to something.
01:42:14 Yeah, I'm not into that.
01:42:16 You don't want to get absorbed into the experience.
01:42:20 Dog.
01:42:22 Dog. No, that's so fucked up.
01:42:24 No, that's what I do.
01:42:25 I put on I put on a fucking two and a half hour.
01:42:29 I two and a half hour retrospective on why
01:42:33 on why Platinum, Pokemon Platinum is better than Pokemon Crystal.
01:42:39 And and then I and then I played Noida for that long.
01:42:43 And then I just said I guess I guess something like more roguelike
01:42:47 like like Noida works in that.
01:42:49 But I usually play like linear games that are a bit more active thinking.
01:42:55 Yeah, I guess it probably wouldn't work well with like a story driven.
01:42:58 Active thinking is not the right word, because obviously there's a lot of active
01:43:00 thinking going on moment to moment in Noida.
01:43:02 But like something that's more narratively engaging, I guess.
01:43:06 Yeah, if I'm going to be engaged by a narrative, I don't want some fucking
01:43:11 white guy telling me how nostalgic he is for, I don't know, Banjo-Kazooie.
01:43:17 Like that's yeah.
01:43:19 Next voicemail is called Bleach Fan 17 3 2 1 Go.
01:43:28 OK, 15 seconds in.
01:43:43 Those who do not know what love is liking it to beauty.
01:43:48 Those who claim to know what love is liking it to ugliness.
01:43:54 Bleach volume 20 and a hypnosis.
01:43:58 Beautiful.
01:44:03 More piano.
01:44:06 This would be better if you played the piano yourself.
01:44:09 But, you know, we all have to work within our limitations.
01:44:14 Yeah, well, you know, the struggle.
01:44:17 But thanks. Thanks, Kubo.
01:44:20 Thanks for the thanks for the wisdom.
01:44:21 It's it's Tite Kubo does Bleach, right?
01:44:24 Yeah. Yeah.

01:45:17 The video was the a Pixie Terry story.
01:45:21 And this is the story of I had heard of this person before.
01:45:24 But this is basically like an in depth, like her whole story on the Internet.
01:45:28 And she's she's she's basically like, like, you know, I was going to say female
01:45:33 AFAB Chris Chan, who wanted to be like a cosplay,
01:45:39 wanted to be a gravure model.
01:45:41 Basically, it was like trans Asian like claim to be Japanese,
01:45:46 even though she wasn't like what else what else.
01:45:50 Um, oh, but the I guess she had there was a time when she had kind of like
01:45:55 a breakdown and she like closed all her accounts and went offline for a while
01:46:00 because Tite Kubo got married and like she had always wanted to like be with Tite
01:46:05 Kubo, he was her husband.
01:46:07 Oh, yeah, but he got married and she couldn't take it.
01:46:12 Good, good stuff.

01:46:46 Three, two, one, go.
01:46:49 Are you actually kidding me, Ben?
01:46:52 You've made me sit here for over a year,
01:46:55 waiting on the Sonichu 102 lecture so you could sit around making a shitty game.
01:47:01 Yes, I can't believe this.
01:47:04 That's exactly right.
01:47:06 I put all of my faith into you and you betrayed me.
01:47:10 I'm so shit. This will not stand.
01:47:13 I will fucking fly out there and I will hunt you down.
01:47:17 And I swear I'll destroy your kneecaps.
01:47:20 Have fun making a video game from a fucking wheelchair.
01:47:24 A loser. That's like the optimal position to be.
01:47:27 Then he can't get up and do other things.
01:47:29 All he can do is sit his computer and finish the game making a video game
01:47:32 from a wheelchair. Who am I? Tom Oliver.
01:47:35 Yeah, seriously.
01:47:37 God forbid.
01:47:40 OK. Yeah, I fucking did it.
01:47:43 Yeah, I fucking made you wait a year so I could make a shit.

01:48:06 By the way, Gib, I think you're really cool.
01:48:11 OK, she didn't hear you stupid.
01:48:15 I'll take that compliment for myself, though.
01:48:17 No. Fuck.
01:48:20 All right. Next one is called Conky Kong.
01:48:22 Three, two, one, go.
01:48:25 No more voicemails.

01:49:29 You know, some people find themselves
01:49:32 waiting for the other shoe to drop.
01:49:34 I was really happy I was waiting for the shoe to drop.
01:49:38 But she no one's ever waiting for the other poo to plop.
01:49:45 Why did he echo me?
01:49:47 I mean, just to remind me that I said that one time, you know,
01:49:51 you've got to have it's like that grayscale, you know, flashback sequence.
01:49:55 Oh, I saw. Oh, I saw it in grayscale.
01:49:57 Oh, absolutely. Of course. Absolutely.
01:50:00 In slow motion. Yeah.
01:50:01 Blurry. Blurry.

01:50:07 the negative space of the image.
01:50:09 Yeah. Yeah.
01:50:10 It's a cinematic painting, a picture.
01:50:12 It's beautiful. Textbook.
01:50:14 It's textbook. Next voicemail.
01:50:16 A message from your gaping ass.
01:50:18 Four, three, two, one, go.
01:50:21 God damn it, Ben.
01:50:23 You and your fucking shitty roundabout ways and loopholes.
01:50:28 You just fucking took away all the power I had.
01:50:31 OK, rape you.
01:50:32 If you give me consent, dumb piece of shit.
01:50:34 Oh, yeah. Great.
01:50:36 Now, what am I supposed to do?
01:50:37 Just jack off thinking about raping you?
01:50:39 That's no fun. I wanted to actually do it.
01:50:41 Now I can't. Can't do it.
01:50:43 I did it. I cracked the code.
01:50:46 I cracked the code. No more rape.
01:50:49 No more rape. Universal consent.
01:50:51 You know, if Andrew Yang gets elected mayor of New York,
01:50:55 I hope he does away with his stupid universal basic income
01:50:59 and implements the policy of universal basic consent.
01:51:02 And that's where we can abolish rape.
01:51:06 You know what? This joke is played out.
01:51:09 You get it. You get it. Ha ha. Funny stuff.
01:51:12 Next one. Audio borked a bit.
01:51:14 But anyway, video games. Three, two, one, go.
01:51:19 Then talking about his game got me thinking
01:51:21 that it would be real cool to do like a PCP game jam or something.
01:51:24 It's real easy to set one up on itch.io.
01:51:27 You can just set the dates and tweet it out.
01:51:29 You could have a theme or restrictions or it could just be free form.
01:51:31 And then you can do a little stream to play through the games
01:51:34 or a special podcast episode where you discuss them
01:51:36 and it would be a fun community event, even outside of games.
01:51:39 I think comic jams or other things like that
01:51:41 would be a neat way to engage with the community
01:51:43 and help foster people's creativity.
01:51:45 Because making and discussing art is way more cool
01:51:47 than talking about Twitter drama.
01:51:50 You know, you know. It's got a point.
01:51:52 You know, actually.
01:51:55 My server, some people in there made a channel.
01:52:01 One of my mods, Spork, made a channel for doing game jam stuff.
01:52:07 And three of them.
01:52:09 And also one other person who I think is not in my discord,
01:52:11 who I don't know, but three of them, Sporktown,
01:52:14 Heroin, Tio and Roxanne Kaiser,
01:52:20 they have been making a game.
01:52:22 And you know what? I will I will link a tweet
01:52:25 because like they're actually making it and it's actually like turning into.
01:52:29 I'm like watching it turning into an actual video game on Twitter,
01:52:33 you know, smugly snickering to myself that, you know,
01:52:37 it started from like a jam sesh or an arrangement agreed upon
01:52:44 in my discord server, which means that I get partial ownership.
01:52:48 I get residuals. That's the deal.
01:52:51 You signed it when you joined my server.
01:52:55 Let's see here.
01:52:59 Tio was tweeting it.
01:53:02 Yes, I found it.
01:53:05 There it is.
01:53:06 Well, as you can see, if you if you follow the link.
01:53:11 Yeah, they got this game that they're making where you're like some kind of bat girl
01:53:15 and you like skate around on rooftops and you glide on your bat wings.
01:53:21 And you I don't know, you do stuff.
01:53:24 And it's looking it's looking good.
01:53:26 It's looking cool.
01:53:29 So, you know, you might you might call that a sort of PCP game
01:53:35 jam of sorts, they just they just did it on their own.
01:53:40 They just fucking did it.
01:53:42 I just realized I posted my picture from like two
01:53:44 hours ago on the wrong chat because I'm an idiot.
01:53:47 Wait, where'd you post yours in the main?
01:53:49 I'll just put it in the the place it should be.
01:53:52 Oh, oh, the cookie cutters.
01:53:54 Yeah, you did.
01:53:55 Well, true, dumb, dumb.
01:54:00 Eleazar can't see that shit.
01:54:01 He's not allowed in the real server.
01:54:03 Forgot.
01:54:07 Keep in this wild garden.
01:54:11 Next voicemail is where is it?
01:54:14 It's Jackass.
01:54:16 Yes, yes, Jackass.
01:54:18 Three, two, one, go.
01:54:21 Hey, guys, you want to know what I just realized?
01:54:24 It's called self-abuse because if you beat your beat hard enough,
01:54:28 your dick starts to cry tears of life.
01:54:31 And unlike a battered woman, it can't call the cops on you.
01:54:35 Said.
01:54:37 I mean.
01:54:40 OK, duh.
01:54:43 You think you tell me that?
01:54:45 Oh, you just figured that out.
01:54:46 Oh, yeah, yeah, bad, bad.
01:54:48 Great. Thanks for the voicemail, sucker.
01:54:52 Next one is called Munky needs a hug.
01:54:55 Three, two, one, go.
01:54:58 You know what, Ben, I heard you saying you don't know why
01:55:00 Munky would want to be back on the podcast if not to talk about Trixie.
01:55:04 Have you ever considered that maybe he just wants to talk to some god damn friends?
01:55:10 You know, like the PCP was mentioned, originally meant to be
01:55:13 excuse for some friends to come together every week and talk to each other
01:55:17 to help keep the friendship together.
01:55:19 That may not have worked for the vast majority of you guys, but fuck.
01:55:22 I'm just sad you don't even seem to consider that angle.
01:55:25 Oh, well, would Munky ever want to hang out with me if not to
01:55:28 shit talk someone who used to be friends with?
01:55:31 I mean, I believe in the power of friendship, man.
01:55:34 I mean, we haven't.
01:55:35 What are you talking about?
01:55:36 We haven't talked.
01:55:36 I haven't talked to him in like in like two years.
01:55:40 I don't know. I'm not.
01:55:41 I hope it. I hope it's not.
01:55:43 I hope it's not the I hope it's not inflammatory to say.
01:55:46 I don't really think we're friends.
01:55:48 We don't like talk, so I don't I don't know, man.
01:55:54 Whatever, who knows what the future holds.
01:55:55 But yeah, I just I just thought.
01:55:59 I just thought it just seemed obvious that if we were going to talk,
01:56:03 that what else that just seems like something that would naturally talk about.
01:56:08 What? But for for content, anyone that doesn't know, I asked.
01:56:12 I asked Munky if he wanted to because because nobody else wanted him to be on the show.
01:56:17 But I was like, well, I mean, maybe I'll just could record something with him
01:56:21 and just talk about Trixie on our own.
01:56:25 And he was like, no, I don't want to talk about her.
01:56:27 I just want to be back on the show.
01:56:28 And I'm like, well, I mean, I get.
01:56:30 But no, I was the only one that wanted to do that.
01:56:36 And I got out of voted.
01:56:38 So I don't know.
01:56:39 I don't know. I don't know if I don't know if that's going to happen.
01:56:42 And like, why and why?
01:56:44 Why would we do it?
01:56:46 If we weren't going to talk about Trixie, it just seems obvious.
01:56:49 It would be it would be just seems natural.
01:56:51 It would be strange.
01:56:52 That's the thing I want to talk about.
01:56:54 That's the thing I would want to talk with him about.
01:56:56 That would be like the obvious launching point, I guess. Right.
01:57:00 Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought.
01:57:03 That's what I thought. And that was my plan.
01:57:05 I don't know.
01:57:07 I don't know.
01:57:08 Um, anyway, next voicemail is called
01:57:11 Sanity check at the silent rave. Joker socks optional.
01:57:16 Three, two, one, go.
01:57:19 Bear and I are locked up now
01:57:24 at the clusterfunk hell sanatorium.
01:57:30 Nothing to do but sing and dance.
01:57:34 Sing and dance and misbehave
01:57:38 at the clusterfunk asylum, silent rave.
01:57:58 Oh, that ended suddenly.
01:57:59 I wasn't expecting it.
01:58:01 Feels like it's a transition piece.
01:58:03 The next like emotional high point of the arc.
01:58:06 Yeah, yeah, I feel like the next one starts right where this one cuts off.
01:58:11 Yeah.
01:58:13 Silent, a silent rave.
01:58:14 That's the thing where like that's a real thing, right?
01:58:16 It's when it's a rave, but like instead of them playing the music,
01:58:20 everyone's got their headphones in, right?
01:58:22 I believe so.
01:58:23 And they're all they're all raving to the music.
01:58:25 But like, if you don't have your headphones in, you can't hear anything.
01:58:28 Yeah. And everyone's dancing.
01:58:29 Just look like freaks.
01:58:31 Yeah. Yeah.
01:58:35 I went to a rave once in Poland.
01:58:38 It was pretty cool.
01:58:43 OK, next voice is called Ben.
01:58:47 Read one piece, please.
01:58:49 Still trying, huh?
01:58:51 Really, it took forty seven seconds for you to deliver this voicemail.
01:58:54 Let's let's see what you let's see what you did with the with that time.
01:58:58 Three, two, one, go.
01:59:00 OK.
01:59:01 Ben, real quick question about the Sanju one or two, not like,
01:59:07 when is it coming out?
01:59:08 Yeah, this time.
01:59:09 But I don't really follow all the pony shit.
01:59:13 I don't care about it.
01:59:14 I am I'm never going to care.
01:59:17 Why would you need to?
01:59:18 I mean, you guys are so into it, but I don't give a fuck.
01:59:22 But what does that have to do with Sanju one or two?
01:59:27 Can you explain that a little bit?
01:59:31 What was it just like you wanted to get one project done before you do another one?
01:59:34 No, it's not like you had one or two done.
01:59:37 And that was content related reasons before.
01:59:40 I feel like I explained this already, but I'll explain.
01:59:42 Also, go to the dentist like your mommy told you it's good for you.
01:59:47 I have. Oh, God.
01:59:49 Oh, God, this freaks me out.
01:59:50 Speaking of the dentist, I think I have a.
01:59:54 I was looking at my teeth the other day and I think I have a spot on one of my
01:59:58 teeth that I think I think is something called a root carry,
02:00:04 which if you Google that, you will find horrifying pictures.
02:00:09 Mine is not like that bad, but I think it is like a very early like root carry
02:00:16 that I was I was reading about like treatments for it.
02:00:19 And I don't know, maybe I'm hope I'm hoping it's not as bad, but like,
02:00:25 you know, if they get bad, they can like destroy your tooth.
02:00:29 You got to just fucking lose that you got a fucking root canal that shit.
02:00:32 And I'm so I'm so fucking scared.
02:00:35 Yeah, I've been ignoring my teeth for like a year.
02:00:37 And I'm pretty sure I got like I went to the dentist.
02:00:42 Like maybe a year and a half ago and because I went there because I thought
02:00:46 I had a really bad cavity and like, yeah, you have cavities,
02:00:49 but you have so many we can only do half your mouth right now.
02:00:52 We'll have to do another one later.
02:00:54 And so they did like all these fillings.
02:00:56 And then ever since then for like a year and a half,
02:00:59 my mouth's been bleeding almost constantly on the side that they did
02:01:03 the fillings and the other side that they didn't is fine.
02:01:05 So I didn't go back because it's like clear, you just made the problem worse.
02:01:09 I don't have.
02:01:10 But I've just been ignoring that.
02:01:12 It was probably a bad idea.
02:01:13 Nothing in my mouth like causes me discomfort or anything.
02:01:17 Like I don't have any like pain or irritation or anything like that.
02:01:23 So I feel like probably nothing is like super advanced to the point
02:01:29 that it's like awful.
02:01:31 But I don't know.
02:01:34 I googled.
02:01:35 I googling, googling about root carry has really made it sound like a dire
02:01:42 any medical issue.
02:01:43 It always makes it 10 million times worse.
02:01:45 And then I'm hoping I'm hoping that that's was the effect that was going on
02:01:51 with that because it was it made it sound like if you've got one of these,
02:01:55 your tooth is fucking done.
02:01:56 You are going under the knife.
02:01:58 You got to cut your whole fucking job.
02:02:00 I mean, at that point, I just like just pull the fucking tooth.
02:02:03 I don't give a shit.
02:02:04 Oh, God, it'd be cheaper, easier.
02:02:08 Fuck it must must just must just suck to get your tooth pulled, though.
02:02:12 Right. Oh, I've never had a.
02:02:13 Sure, it's a bitch, but Jesus.
02:02:18 But about Sonichu.
02:02:19 Yeah, the reason why it's not it's not just pony shit.
02:02:26 My comic Slime and Punishment is Sonichu Canon.
02:02:31 It is official Sonichu Canon.
02:02:33 It is technically Sonichu special number.
02:02:38 Hold on.
02:02:40 It is Sonichu special number seven or eight, I think.
02:02:44 Let me let me find that out for sure.
02:02:48 Sonichu, Sonichu comic.
02:02:51 Go down to the chapter listings, Sonichu special number.
02:02:55 Yeah, Slime and Punishment is Sonichu special number seven.
02:02:59 So in covering the lore of Sonichu, I had to talk about
02:03:05 Slime and Punishment.
02:03:06 And so I wanted Slime and Punishment to be done before I released that video.
02:03:11 And the game is the end of Slime and Punishment.
02:03:17 So that is why I waited.
02:03:19 I wanted to wait to release Sonichu 102
02:03:23 so that all the canon could be out when I talk about it.
02:03:29 And that's it.
02:03:31 Next voicemail is called a simple misunderstanding.
02:03:34 Three, two, one, go.
02:03:37 Hey, Ben, just wanted to clarify some things.
02:03:42 When I said that you would stop being a dumb leftist,
02:03:46 I did not mean that you would stop being a leftist altogether.
02:03:50 You mean I would stop being dumb.
02:03:51 I just meant you would start being a based and history
02:03:54 pillow leftist because my bastard is very good and very funny.
02:04:00 Well, and you would get a better understanding of why your beliefs are based.
02:04:07 That was all.
02:04:08 Fair enough. I apologize if that I wasn't specific about that.
02:04:13 Don't apologize to me.
02:04:14 Apologize to that guy.
02:04:15 Anticipate the misunderstanding.
02:04:18 Sorry about that.
02:04:19 It's fine.
02:04:19 My bad. It's fine.
02:04:21 Have a great one.
02:04:24 You too, buddy.
02:04:25 Yeah, OK.
02:04:26 All right. Love you.
02:04:30 I understand.
02:04:31 I get you.
02:04:34 Cool. I mean, yeah, it's always more based to know more than to know less.
02:04:41 True.
02:04:43 I should be more history pilled.
02:04:46 I don't I don't once in a while
02:04:49 I will listen to like a history podcast or something and like I like it.
02:04:53 And it's cool, but I don't do it that often.
02:04:56 And so I often am like, I just don't know as much about some things as maybe I ought to.
02:05:04 Yeah, next voicemail is called Autism 101.
02:05:08 And oh, my God, it's a minute 26.
02:05:11 This is better be good. Three, two, one, go.
02:05:14 Hey, guys, just wanted to explain some things about autism that you guys seem to have had difficulty last week's talk
02:05:21 because that's kind of frustrating.
02:05:23 You guys don't know about that, but that's OK.
02:05:25 I'm going to try and explain.
02:05:26 I got a lot of things to talk about, so I'll be quick.
02:05:28 So autism, it is, in fact, two spectrums because it affects two areas of behavior in humans.
02:05:36 And to be autistic, you just have to land somewhere on those two spectrums.
02:05:42 It can be very high on one and very low on the other, et cetera, et cetera.
02:05:48 Those two areas of human development and behavior are the interpersonal communication and ability to socially communicate.
02:05:59 And it is the repetitive behavior and limited interest areas of human behavior.
02:06:08 So, in essence, autistic people will generally have some inflexibility, be very attached to their routines to various degrees,
02:06:19 and they will also have a varying degree of difficulties with interpersonal communication or communication in general.
02:06:28 And that's pretty much the basics of what autism is.
02:06:32 Hope that was helpful.
02:06:35 I see you.
02:06:36 Love you, Deb.
02:06:37 Love you, Ben.
02:06:38 Fuck you.
02:06:39 I'm out.
02:06:43 With all due respect, no, that wasn't very helpful because I already said all that.
02:06:47 I literally said all those things last week.
02:06:52 I don't get it.
02:06:53 What are you trying to clarify here?
02:06:56 What about that did I get wrong?
02:06:58 I mean, I'm not trying to antagonize you, but I don't get it.
02:07:06 I don't get it.
02:07:07 What are you correcting me on?
02:07:08 What's the problem?
02:07:09 I don't know.
02:07:10 I don't know.
02:07:11 Thanks for the voicemail.
02:07:15 Next one is called Riley is bad at his job part two.
02:07:19 Three, two, one, go.
02:07:21 All right.
02:07:22 So I want to make some clarifications on my voicemail segment.
02:07:25 Riley is bad at his job from last week.
02:07:28 So I know that he calls himself a producer and not a promoter.
02:07:34 I also wanted to argue that he's a bad at promotion.
02:07:38 So that's why I said promoter.
02:07:39 He's also a terrible producer because he fucking can't produce an RV.
02:07:43 He can't produce sound because his audio sounds like garbage.
02:07:47 He can't produce fucking fans because he drives them away every time the smug little
02:07:51 dipshit opens his mouth.
02:07:53 So he's also bad at that part of his job.
02:07:55 That's true.
02:07:56 Ethan Ralph bit.
02:07:57 So what had happened there was after the fight, both parties agreed to go on the Dick
02:08:02 show and like talk about it.
02:08:04 Yeah.
02:08:05 Fucking Ethan Ralph called in and he was comparing himself to the Joker and it was really cringe.
02:08:10 People on the Dick show also hate Ethan Ralph.
02:08:13 So you know, really anybody could have taken it, but Riley chose not to call in.
02:08:17 He said he was busy on the discord thing, even though he was there the entire time.
02:08:22 What?
02:08:23 He just looked like an absolute bitch.
02:08:25 Why?
02:08:26 You'd think that as a hip hop guy, he'd know that beefing is good for business, but that
02:08:30 would imply that he's good at his job, which is I mean, they made that whole video to
02:08:34 make beef out of PCP forever.
02:08:36 Tom will never die.
02:08:37 Call me back.
02:08:38 Okay.
02:08:40 That actually, I didn't know that that actually does really baffle me.
02:08:44 Like it's like the whole thing cloud chasing.
02:08:48 Like why would you not chase that?
02:08:50 Yeah.
02:08:51 If you're making the video, like you're make the video.
02:08:54 It's all about the beef you have.
02:08:57 And I mean, those the the Yig people, like they love Dick, they love the Dick show.
02:09:02 Like they want to be on it.
02:09:05 They they they'll go, I don't understand that and there's like a perfectly good opportunity
02:09:10 to go.
02:09:11 I that actually really throws me and I don't know what to make of it.
02:09:15 It's very good.
02:09:17 If someone can explain why I, I mean, I, I mean, I, I don't agree with a lot of their
02:09:26 choices, but if you make the choices that they made, you know, you get in that situation,
02:09:31 you make that video about it.
02:09:33 Why then?
02:09:34 No, I don't want to talk about it.
02:09:37 Why would you do that?
02:09:38 I don't get it.
02:09:39 I don't get it.
02:09:42 But yeah, just another reason he's bad at his job.
02:09:47 Why next voicemail is called why you got to assume three, two, one, go.
02:09:52 Why you gotta assume every color's gender been always like, thank you, sir.
02:09:57 Okay.
02:09:58 Mr. I think he said, just say they make it, you ain't gotta assume.
02:10:04 You're probably right.
02:10:06 You're probably right.
02:10:07 I have a bad habit of just kind of assuming male by default, which is our analytics.
02:10:16 You're probably right more often than not.
02:10:19 Probably.
02:10:20 But I also, you know, I feel like it's becoming, I think I'm becoming less and less probably
02:10:28 right with each passing day.
02:10:30 Everyone's getting, everyone's getting pink pilled and you know, it's, it's, it's starting
02:10:34 to cause an inconvenience for me personally.
02:10:36 So I don't like trans people anymore is what I'm saying.
02:10:39 Oh no.
02:10:40 Pink pilled.
02:10:41 It's funny you say pink pilled because I, I misheard the colors as colors and I was
02:10:45 like, did I miss something last week?
02:10:47 Yeah.
02:10:48 Yeah.
02:10:49 I thought that's, yeah.
02:10:50 I thought so too.
02:10:51 But then I got the context.
02:10:52 I was like, oh, callers.
02:10:53 Yeah.
02:10:54 Yeah.
02:10:55 Yeah.
02:10:56 No, this, this color is right.
02:10:57 I probably should just default to they more, I, I advocate for everyone to do that.
02:11:02 But I don't, I don't always put my money where my mouth is.
02:11:06 They is just the perfect pronoun.
02:11:08 More people, more people should use it more often and I should, I should be the change
02:11:12 that I want to see in the world.
02:11:13 I wish all pronouns, they for everything.
02:11:16 Yeah.
02:11:17 Well, all pronouns except that one because that one's good.
02:11:19 Yeah.
02:11:20 I guess, I guess you can stay and I, I can stay.
02:11:23 No, they, only they for all those.
02:11:28 Yeah.
02:11:29 Yeah.
02:11:30 Yeah.
02:11:31 We is right out.
02:11:33 Next, next voicemail is called perpetually two weeks behind three, two, one, go.
02:11:40 Hey, I wanted to ask.
02:11:43 What's the ideal fame to money ratio?
02:11:48 Because if you have a lot of fame, you can get a lot of money and people will recognize
02:11:53 you on the streets in like your entire life is now a public figure.
02:11:58 But if you have no fame, chances are you're not going to get much money.
02:12:02 And I think it's very interesting how the different members of the PCP and previous
02:12:07 PCP all had like different levels of fame and what they wanted from fame.
02:12:13 Like Ben, he, he is pretty famous, but he's not so famous that most people would recognize
02:12:23 him on the street.
02:12:24 I wish I was more famous.
02:12:25 Even less famous.
02:12:26 Like I, I'm a fan of the PCP and I don't even think I'd be able to identify him if I saw
02:12:33 him outside.
02:12:34 Wait, who?
02:12:35 I was assuming you who were very famous.
02:12:39 You know, I'm sure they got a lot of money.
02:12:41 I think it kind of went to their head, you know, so I'm just curious.
02:12:45 I wouldn't even call Trixie very famous, optimal level of fame, I mean, Trixie is Trixie at
02:12:52 her peak was like approaching like baseline internet at her, at her peak.
02:13:00 I mean, she, she did rarely get recognized in public.
02:13:05 Like not often, but it happened.
02:13:08 Actually, I mean, I got recognized by something by a stranger just completely at random, at
02:13:15 least like once or twice.
02:13:18 Same.
02:13:19 So did you?
02:13:20 Always the most.
02:13:21 Yeah, twice.
02:13:22 It was very awkward.
02:13:23 Um, mine was, mine was fine.
02:13:26 It was just like, it was awkward on my part because I was not prepared.
02:13:29 It's like, bye.
02:13:31 I thought it was awesome.
02:13:32 I was like, oh my God, holy shit.
02:13:35 Uh, million views, baby.
02:13:37 Um, the, the, uh, I mean, I just, I don't know, I don't like this question because
02:13:46 I feel like more of both is always better.
02:13:49 Oh, like the optimal mix of the two is just as much of both as I can get, please.
02:13:56 I mean, there's definitely a limit for me.
02:13:58 I don't want to be like so famous that like I, when I go outside, like I get recognized
02:14:03 left and right.
02:14:04 But I think like in the sphere that we're involved in, that's not even an option.
02:14:09 Like I think like, yeah, you can be, you can have like 10, 15, 20 million subscribers
02:14:15 or something and still not get recognized when you go outside because like the internet's
02:14:19 just like not big enough, you know, so, yeah.
02:14:25 I mean, yeah, fame, fame on the level that it would like interfere with my daily life
02:14:31 is like so far away that like doesn't happen in our pursuits at all.
02:14:38 Yeah.
02:14:39 Yeah.
02:14:40 So I mean, I mean, just if I, um, I mean, I guess it would be bad.
02:14:51 I guess I would lean a little more towards money just because if you are very famous,
02:14:56 but you have no money, like you're still, you're still poor.
02:15:00 You're still fucked.
02:15:01 Yeah.
02:15:02 Whereas if you, if you're not famous at all, but you have tons of money, then like you
02:15:06 can become famous.
02:15:08 This guy implied, sorry, this person implied, I shouldn't assume gender.
02:15:11 It's true.
02:15:12 I say that like it's a joke, but I actually mean it sincerely.
02:15:16 This person implied that like having more fame implies that you have more money.
02:15:22 No, no, no, no, they said having more money implies that you have more fame and like that's
02:15:29 not true at all.
02:15:31 You can just like.
02:15:32 Chris Chan's pretty famous, doesn't have a ton of money.
02:15:35 That's true.
02:15:36 Also like in the verse, you could just inherit a bunch of money or maybe you just fucking
02:15:43 invested like a thousand dollars in Bitcoin in 2008 or whenever it started.
02:15:49 And now you are, now you have fucking 500,000 is lying around somewhere and like you don't
02:15:58 have to be famous at all to do that.
02:16:00 And once you've got a bunch of money, it's easy to turn that money into more money and
02:16:05 like.
02:16:06 Yeah.
02:16:07 Or turn it into fame.
02:16:08 You can buy attention.
02:16:09 You can buy attention.
02:16:10 So yeah, I would probably say money.
02:16:13 I would lean towards money because like having no fame, having tons of money can solve all
02:16:19 your problems.
02:16:20 Having tons of fame, having tons of fame doesn't necessarily solve every problem that you will
02:16:24 face as a result of having no money.
02:16:27 Yeah.
02:16:28 So that yeah, okay, satisfactorily answered.
02:16:33 Next one is called it's all downhill from six.
02:16:37 She her three, two, one, go.
02:16:40 I recently rewatched the final fantasy lecture.
02:16:44 Still a pretty good watch, even though it's mainly just Wikipedia plot summaries of all
02:16:48 the games and that's my least favorite one really and gotta be honest, like my least
02:16:52 favorite one.
02:16:53 But Ben, you had mentioned that Final Fantasy six is your favorite, which is based as fucking
02:16:58 I agree.
02:16:59 It is the best one.
02:17:00 Yes.
02:17:01 And it seems to generally stand seven, but you know where it's at.
02:17:07 Who's your favorite party member?
02:17:08 Cool.
02:17:11 My favorite.
02:17:16 My favorite party member.
02:17:24 God, I don't fucking know.
02:17:26 I don't know.
02:17:28 I feel like maybe my I'm drawn to six.
02:17:33 Honestly, maybe a little bit out of a contrarian urge to be like, to be like, seven's not
02:17:40 that great.
02:17:41 Six is where it's really at.
02:17:42 But at the same time, I genuinely had moments in six that like were really good.
02:17:47 And I mean, seven's got great moments too.
02:17:50 But you know, like the part where you catch the fish for Sid, it's like that part's great.
02:17:56 You know, the opera house, the opera house is so like cheesy.
02:18:01 It's a little it's a little like goofy.
02:18:03 But like, you know, whatever, if you just if you just let yourself enjoy it, it's like
02:18:09 it's fun.
02:18:10 It's a fun.
02:18:11 It's a fun time.
02:18:12 I don't know.
02:18:13 I don't know if I, I mean, it's been a while since I played.
02:18:20 I like Saban.
02:18:21 I like Saban's like fighting commands for his his special moves.
02:18:26 I think that's pretty cool.
02:18:30 The I don't know.
02:18:33 I don't know.
02:18:35 They're all they're all kind of they're like mechanically all pretty similar to each other
02:18:40 story wise.
02:18:41 I guess I like.
02:18:45 Oh my god.
02:18:46 Is it Cyrus?
02:18:47 Is Cyrus the knight that you pick up like late, late, later in the game?
02:18:51 I think he's pretty.
02:18:53 He's a pretty cool guy.
02:18:54 I don't know.
02:18:56 Oh, none of the none of the characters really have like a ton of.
02:19:01 None of the characters in six have like a ton of like development, like they don't have
02:19:05 as much as they get in seven.
02:19:06 Like in that level, I think like seven's got better characters.
02:19:13 Whatever. Sorry.
02:19:14 I feel like.
02:19:16 This is this is a six.
02:19:18 This is a six aficionado.
02:19:19 He might be disappointed with my inability to articulate like my my preferences about
02:19:25 it, but it's been a long time.
02:19:27 Fucking up your brain.
02:19:28 I'm I'm fucking up my brand right now, my my six loving brand next next voicemail is
02:19:34 called our pal Doug three two one go.
02:19:39 Just to give you guys an excuse to talk about nostalgia critic again.
02:19:42 I have the weird distinction of having seen Doug Walker in person twice before ever having
02:19:48 seen his content, both of the same Walgreens, so he must live near me.
02:19:54 The third time I saw him, I'd actually seen some of his videos and it was the Gallup and
02:19:58 Ghost Arcade.
02:19:59 And I remember like, I fucking, it was so interesting because the first time I was
02:20:02 like, oh, it's like, oh, it's all exciting.
02:20:04 It was like, it was the internet man out.
02:20:06 Look at that.
02:20:06 He's like internet famous.
02:20:07 I'd never seen one of his videos.
02:20:08 So I was all like, oh, interesting.
02:20:11 The third time I met him, I had seen his videos and I fucking hate them.
02:20:14 And it was a completely different experience where I was like, oh, there he is.
02:20:17 Look at him.
02:20:18 Look at that goblin.
02:20:20 I just think it's fucking funny.
02:20:22 How.
02:20:24 How do you remember that you saw him twice before you knew who he was?
02:20:30 I would assume he knew his face, but didn't see his content.
02:20:33 Like just like, oh, I know that someone from the internet I've seen like screenshots or
02:20:37 people talk about them on social media or whatever.
02:20:39 But I've just never watched the content.
02:20:41 Oh, like he knew who Doug Walker was.
02:20:43 Just hadn't seen his videos.
02:20:45 Right.
02:20:46 Oh, yeah, that could be it.
02:20:48 I was thinking that maybe this was just like a person that like you knew from
02:20:52 around town to maybe like, why is this guy walking around with like a loose
02:20:57 fitting tie and like a weird hat?
02:21:01 And that was that was what keyed him in to getting interest in him.
02:21:06 It's like, I got it.
02:21:07 I got this guy's there.
02:21:08 What this guy must have a story.
02:21:09 I got a I got to hire a private eye to figure this guy out.
02:21:12 And you find out he's a he's the head of a of a fucking global
02:21:17 monolith of internet criticism.
02:21:20 He started a revolution.
02:21:22 He's that guy with the glasses.
02:21:25 He's he's that guy.
02:21:27 He's the he's the guy with the glasses.
02:21:30 We have one brand.
02:21:32 We have one more voicemail and it is called Autism 102.
02:21:37 Oh, no, I hope it's better than the last one.
02:21:41 Three, two, one, go.
02:21:44 Hey, gang, just wanted to explain a couple more things about autism
02:21:48 before I left you guys alone.
02:21:50 It's very hard for autistic people and non-autistic people to empathize
02:21:56 with each other because our brains work in very, very different ways,
02:22:02 like fundamentally.
02:22:04 And since, you know, when you try to like discern motivations or
02:22:09 intentions, but I thought it was a spectrum, two spectrums, it's very hard
02:22:12 because you don't have the same framework that led them to those decisions.
02:22:16 I don't know.
02:22:17 I'm not trying to defend tricks here or anything.
02:22:21 I'm just, you know, it's hard.
02:22:23 It's hard. I've done with this.
02:22:25 She's not autistic life.
02:22:26 She's not fucking autistic.
02:22:27 Like I make a decision.
02:22:29 I think about something and people look at me like, why the fuck are you doing?
02:22:34 That's a logical step.
02:22:36 Oh, OK.
02:22:37 What?
02:22:38 And so it's kind of hard to really know if when someone's autistic,
02:22:45 what's going on in their head.
02:22:48 She does or she's not even it's not even clear what she thinks.
02:22:53 So, yeah, try not to, you know, scribe intentions and shit.
02:23:00 It's kind of kind of leads to bad stuff.
02:23:03 What the fuck is this?
02:23:04 All right, that's what I want to say.
02:23:06 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
02:23:07 Am I speaking out of turn, but I'm annoyed.
02:23:09 I this is annoying.
02:23:10 I don't have a contact.
02:23:11 So what are you talking about?
02:23:13 Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
02:23:15 Don't ascribe intentions to things that someone with autism has because
02:23:22 non-autistic people and autistic people just can't empathize with each other.
02:23:27 So I don't know.
02:23:29 I get OK.
02:23:30 I think the point is like an autistic person
02:23:33 operates with a different mental framework.
02:23:35 So like you partially actions is not necessarily what they were coming at it from.
02:23:40 But like that extends to people in general, right?
02:23:43 Like everybody kind of processes things in their own way.
02:23:46 And like it's easy to misunderstand intention.
02:23:49 The the.
02:23:50 Oh, God, like, OK, autism is two spectrums.
02:23:57 So are you I mean, two people can be at different points on the spectrum,
02:24:03 but still like share some things in common, right?
02:24:06 Because they both they both two people exist on, you know,
02:24:11 on points along this well-defined spectrum.
02:24:14 They're they're not polar opposites of one another.
02:24:17 They are all arranged along this linear continuum.
02:24:23 So it's not like it's not like there's nothing in common.
02:24:27 It's not like there's no understanding that can be.
02:24:30 I don't I don't really know to what extent.
02:24:36 I don't.
02:24:38 First of all, first of all, OK,
02:24:41 assuming we're talking about someone who is like really profoundly autistic
02:24:44 to the point that I like a non-autistic person just can't empathize with them,
02:24:51 can't understand the way they think their motivations.
02:24:53 Sure, fair enough.
02:24:54 Is Trixie that? No.
02:24:56 Is Trixie autistic? No.
02:24:58 Uh, I know I'm not a doctor.
02:25:00 I know maybe she maybe she should get a diagnosed by a doctor
02:25:04 or something before we say that for sure.
02:25:06 But that's the point.
02:25:07 She hasn't been diagnosed with anything.
02:25:09 I mean, even if even if Trixie was to get diagnosed,
02:25:13 like it would be a mild case, like because I mean, like, right,
02:25:16 it's not it's not like there's like any sort of like communication barrier there.
02:25:21 Like, yeah, on a fundamental level, like we've collaborated,
02:25:24 worked on projects for years, like we've it's there's definitely
02:25:28 you know, enough of a common barrier there that I think I think I'm comfortable
02:25:33 saying that to some extent, the likes of you and I can ascribe
02:25:38 some kind of motivation behind Trixie's actions.
02:25:42 I'm pretty sure that we're capable of empathizing at least a little bit
02:25:47 with what she with her brain.
02:25:50 Right. I don't think the barrier there is impassable.
02:25:53 I'm sure I'm a little annoyed.
02:25:55 I'm a little pissed off.
02:25:56 I would just argue the entire like basis of our friendship going back
02:26:01 to like the pony days is that we were all kind of doing similar things
02:26:04 and coming at things from a similar angle.
02:26:06 That was kind of how our friendship was forged to begin with.
02:26:08 So, yeah, I don't know, like.
02:26:15 I'm being hard on this guy.
02:26:17 I mean, I don't think there's anything wrong with making this case.
02:26:20 I just don't know if it applies in this particular situation.
02:26:23 Well, that's the point I I feel like it nakedly doesn't apply.
02:26:26 Like to the point that I'm like confused about what is even trying to say.
02:26:30 Well, again, I'm operating without context for prior episodes.
02:26:35 But like, obviously, we know much more about how Trixie acts and is in person
02:26:40 than this person. The short version is that I guess at some point
02:26:45 or at one or two points in the past, Trixie has talked about being autistic
02:26:49 or behaving as though she's she's like alluded to it.
02:26:53 And people were saying and I said like,
02:26:58 you know, actually, it's kind of I said, like, you know, that should be diagnosed.
02:27:01 You can't self diagnose that.
02:27:03 And some people were like, well, I don't know, it's like.
02:27:07 And I know that like it's it's it is it's diagnosed through like a series of questions.
02:27:13 So it's not like I mean, like in theory, in theory, if you really understood autism,
02:27:18 you wouldn't necessarily have to be a doctor to make like a credible case
02:27:21 that like, oh, yeah, this person is, you know, far enough along with whatever these spectrums.
02:27:25 Like, yeah, you could probably like maybe that you would need some you would need
02:27:28 at least some level of expertise, you need to be some level of expertise.
02:27:32 Right. I would I would say if nothing for no other reason,
02:27:35 like you can't objectively give yourself an examination
02:27:40 because like your own biases are going to be clouding your own right that that too.
02:27:45 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, yeah, I said, like, you know, you should at least
02:27:50 have some level of expertise.
02:27:52 You should be to diagnose yourself.
02:27:54 But yeah, it's probably even if you are an expert, you shouldn't be able to diagnose yourself
02:27:58 because obviously you're going to be biased about when the subject believe it.
02:28:02 And you can say like I resonate a lot with these symptoms and like I probably have it.
02:28:07 But like until you get diagnosed, you can't really say for sure.
02:28:10 It's like for a while, I thought that I had mild ADHD.
02:28:14 But I didn't like say I had ADHD until I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist.
02:28:18 And they were like, yeah, like here's medication.
02:28:20 I made the argument last time that like being autistic since it's a spectrum,
02:28:26 it's kind of like being tall, where like, OK, maybe if you like if you're
02:28:31 in the middle of the spectrum and you go to a professional and you they do a test
02:28:37 and the result is like, well, you kind of display some autistic traits.
02:28:42 It's like, well, OK, so are you autistic then?
02:28:47 Maybe like there's not really an answer.
02:28:50 But like it's just like any other human made category where like the category
02:28:54 doesn't actually exist.
02:28:55 It's just a way of categorizing a sequence of traits and things like that.
02:29:00 So like, right.
02:29:01 It's all it's all fucking dicey if you really start like hacking away at it.
02:29:05 It's a good well, well put, well put, it's it's it's a category.
02:29:10 It's it's a line.
02:29:11 It's a line that we draw around a certain cluster of traits.
02:29:16 And we say these are we call we call these traits this thing.
02:29:21 If you're like this, you're autistic.
02:29:23 But it's like, well, I'm kind of like that.
02:29:25 But like, I'm not all the way like that.
02:29:27 And like, I have a little bit like that, but I'm kind of on the edge.
02:29:30 That's the whole point of saying it's a spectrum in the first place.
02:29:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:29:36 True, true.
02:29:37 But like, I don't know where.
02:29:43 What are we even talking about?
02:29:44 What was the question?
02:29:47 I'm I'm, you know, damn, I don't like this note.
02:29:53 I don't like this as a note to go out on.
02:29:59 Shit.
02:30:01 Somebody quick, somebody send in the new voice.
02:30:04 Five at five.
02:30:05 Maybe someone left a voicemail.
02:30:08 No, no, no, I'm refreshing, but there's nothing.
02:30:12 What are you doing there?
02:30:14 Ah, fuck it, whatever.
02:30:15 You know what? We so what this episode sucks.
02:30:17 We make these every week.
02:30:19 They'll come back to the trough for more slop next time.
02:30:22 And then we can make up for it.
02:30:25 This is what happens when there's no give.
02:30:26 The episode just sucks.
02:30:28 The episode just sucks.
02:30:30 And everyone hates it.
02:30:31 Apps in the chat for give.
02:30:33 She wasn't feeling good.
02:30:35 Oh, yeah, she said she was feeling sicker than usual today,
02:30:38 which is very unfortunate because like, damn,
02:30:41 she's been sick for like a
02:30:43 kind of like almost a month now, right?
02:30:44 Yeah, Jesus.
02:30:45 That sucks.
02:30:48 Hope it's not her liver, pancreas or whatever the fuck.
02:30:56 Gulp, she's coming down with a case of the autism.
02:31:00 Yeah, it's it's it's contagious.
02:31:02 Actually, I hear.
02:31:04 Oh, no, we're all infected then.
02:31:06 Trixie got it.
02:31:07 She's spanked.
02:31:10 See, more contagious than covid.
02:31:12 What were we thinking?
02:31:14 And deadly or two.
02:31:18 There's no vaccine for that.
02:31:19 There's no vaccine for that, baby.
02:31:21 Are you vexed? Did you get vexed?
02:31:23 Not yet.
02:31:24 Did you see I got vexed?
02:31:25 I got did I did I mention on the last episode?
02:31:28 Did I get my shot?
02:31:29 I was in here.
02:31:30 I don't I don't remember.
02:31:32 Whatever, if I didn't mention it last time.
02:31:33 Yeah, I got my first shot and I'm getting another one in three
02:31:38 at two, two, two to three weeks, going to be going to be cool.
02:31:44 I saw the dev of that game.
02:31:49 What game?
02:31:51 Clarence is Clarence's big chance.
02:31:54 You know that they talk about that is familiar.
02:31:57 It's the game where you play as like a fat, middle age,
02:32:01 disgusting slob who has who has like who has like fucking
02:32:08 tricked his way into getting a date with a hot girl tonight.
02:32:11 And he's got to like he's got to do his day perfectly so that he can be
02:32:15 all set up to have like the perfect date and impress the girl.
02:32:19 And he's got to like he's got to like find computers to like find her files
02:32:23 so he can find out like what she likes and like buy her all the right gifts
02:32:26 and like answer all of her questions in the way that will please her the most
02:32:30 so that he can find his true love.
02:32:33 Anyway, I saw the dev of that game saying that like the covid vaccine was
02:32:38 really fucking with him and I said, damn, dude, sorry to hear that.
02:32:42 Gone by and he liked it.
02:32:44 He liked my reply to his tweet.
02:32:46 So I thought that was pretty cool.
02:32:50 Tobias Cornwall, the guy who got his fucking pineal gland removed
02:32:54 because he had brain cancer or something.
02:32:58 Oh, God.
02:32:59 I know, right?
02:33:00 I'm only thinking about any of these things.
02:33:02 No, it's scary as hell.
02:33:04 But he fucking did it and he's he's good.
02:33:08 He's good now.
02:33:09 I kind of hope that we're young enough that maybe by like 2050,
02:33:13 when we're like getting old, we'll finally have like artificial organ cloning.
02:33:17 So maybe our bodies won't completely break down.
02:33:20 But I feel like God, I hope so thinking.
02:33:23 I feel like even if they have that, that'll just be reserved for the rich
02:33:26 because we'll be in hardcore neo feudalism by then.
