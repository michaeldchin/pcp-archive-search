00:00:19 Completely different solved none pointers
00:00:22 These complimentary songs. Welcome to the Pro Crastinators podcast.
00:00:26 Oh no, it wasn't Cranstonators podcast. I'm my fucking with my volume. Why am I so
00:00:34 Too quiet or too loud? I don't know whatever. I think my volume will automatically adjust
00:00:39 I'm Ben Saint and this is Gibb and take. Hey gays
00:00:43 We're after after finally having a good episode last week. We're back to the regular post death
00:00:51 PCP arc to people
00:00:53 Nothing happening. It's you've got a you got a you know, it's like
00:01:00 Forced scarcity is like manufactured
00:01:03 Scarcity of the of the good episodes. You can't give them too many
00:01:07 No, then they wouldn't get excited
00:01:10 Then then they wouldn't pop then they wouldn't Pog when the episode was good they get used to being good
00:01:16 You know
00:01:18 And it all credibles once everyone's Poggin, no one will be you know, it's like that. I remember I remember
00:01:36 True when what happened this week?
00:01:40 What's what's on the what's on the plate? I felt like nothing
00:01:45 happened
00:01:47 For me. I was so confused that it was Saturday yesterday. I thought it was like Tuesday
00:01:53 I thought it was Wednesday. I thought nothing had happened because nothing had happened
00:01:56 I've been playing Minecraft and listening to Sean videos
00:02:00 Like an idiot Sean. I love Sean. Yeah, he's the only he's the only I think he's the only breadtuber that I still
00:02:07 Listen to and only because he puts out like one video every two months
00:02:11 Not only because of that also because he's a genius and he's never said anything. I disagree with ever his entire life
00:02:18 Incredible it is incredible. I
00:02:22 Tip my hat to him
00:02:24 I
00:02:26 I'm like that every week every week
00:02:28 like Thursday is coming around and I'm like
00:02:32 It's it hits midnight on Thursday, and then I'm like, oh, it's Friday. Oh wait the episode is coming out today
00:02:39 Okay, wait shit. That means we gotta do another one like two days from now. No, and then
00:02:46 It's all yeah, it feels like feels shorter and shorter the walls are closing in
00:02:52 The the time is just goes speeding right along faster and faster
00:02:57 my
00:02:58 My debt my own mortality approaches. I don't know
00:03:04 necessarily like
00:03:05 Age I think and like in macro scale the age like
00:03:11 Minutes feel shorter or whatever
00:03:13 Years feel shorter the more years you've experienced you start coming and they don't stop coming
00:03:19 but like
00:03:20 For when you don't notice an entire week purse. I think that's more just you haven't been doing
00:03:27 Unique things each day. I've been doing basically the same thing every day
00:03:31 And that's why I feel like I didn't realize
00:03:35 That the days had gone by
00:03:37 Yeah, I think that's an element for me, too. I spent I
00:03:44 Worked I worked on the I worked on the game some more this this week not as much as I want to but I mean that's every I never I never
00:03:50 get to spend I
00:03:52 Never get as much done as I wanted to
00:03:56 I spent a lot of this week arguing on Twitter
00:03:58 I
00:04:00 It is with that was annoying
00:04:03 I've been very angry
00:04:06 This week. Yeah, I had a lot of things to be angry about I had that. Yeah, I had that fucking
00:04:13 I mean, I guess I guess the most descriptive word
00:04:18 I guess you could call it would be a debate with that that fucking guy with that my
00:04:24 my my fellow
00:04:26 Crystorian spit
00:04:29 Dylan Thomas
00:04:32 fucking
00:04:34 Got a lot of got so many fucking kiwi farmers and psychopaths and my mentions all week long
00:04:41 Because they hate me now
00:04:43 Because I was arguing the
00:04:47 The crazy the disgustingly transphobic opinion that Chris is trans because she says she's female
00:04:56 That's that's a
00:04:59 But then I don't like that's what that's what then that's what
00:05:05 That's what transphobes want you to say they want you to
00:05:09 Say that she is one of them one of the trans people because she's bad
00:05:15 And if you say that she is a trans just cuz she says so then they can make fun of them
00:05:23 They can say trans people bad Ben. You are
00:05:41 That was a real gremlin moment
00:05:44 Hashtag gremlin moment, right? Oops. Oops. Sorry everyone. Just have a little gremlin moment right there. You know what I'm saying
00:05:54 Oh, man, I had a really there was that one one
00:05:58 particularly angry live live wire that I got into a big thing with yesterday, but like all week
00:06:04 I've been getting all these all these retweets out of nowhere
00:06:07 I'm just all the random DMs from people just like, you know, calling me a faggot or whatever and it's like, okay
00:06:14 I'll thanks see see I got one today from a just from a guy whose
00:06:21 Twitter avatars just stand from South Park saying you are cringe. So, you know that ruined my day
00:06:32 Another one called me soy that one hurt a lot, you know that one really stung I
00:06:43 Try not to let it show sometimes but when people say when people see the soy inside
00:06:50 No, I try so hard to hide it
00:06:55 Yeah, so, you know like you said
00:06:58 When when you spend your time doing a lot of repetitive shit
00:07:01 It goes by really really bad the times that's arguing on Twitter the time just flies by
00:07:07 Hours go by and and I'm just like what what have I done? What have I done a lot of time?
00:07:14 I'm reading tweet arguments you've been having and being like thank God, it's not me thank God
00:07:20 I'm sorry about that. Jesus. No, no, I mean like I've been seeing what you've been going through and it's like
00:07:28 I know it must suck. It must suck just reading them. I don't I mean, I really shouldn't engage. I really engage more than I should
00:07:37 Yeah, I guess I'll briefly touch on that
00:07:43 Debate that quote-unquote debate itself the the gist of it. Okay, I don't necessarily recommend anyone go watch
00:07:49 It's not that funny. It's short and it's frustrating and it's infuriating
00:07:54 They basically the argument went
00:07:57 Dylan I
00:07:59 Say I say Chris is a FEMA is a trans woman because she says so because that's what being trans is
00:08:06 Identifying as female Dylan says Chris is not just transgender. Chris is also transsexual and Chris
00:08:15 did weird Chris and Chris did weird stuff about being like Chris tried to be
00:08:21 Transsexual what whatever that means in a weird way that is not typical
00:08:26 like the time where she she cut her her crotch and the time where she like
00:08:31 drank some like menopause medic medicine or something and
00:08:35 He said like therefore she is not
00:08:40 Transsexual because those were odd things to do and I was like what what are you talking about?
00:08:47 I'm talking about gender and he was like no, but she's a trend shut up. Stop changing the subject
00:08:52 So we went but I was like no I'm talking about gender and he was like, okay
00:08:56 So they he just he he had the same like two arguments that every one of these these two likes non arguments that every one of these
00:09:03 People have they all think they're so smart
00:09:06 Repeating the same like bullshit. It doesn't fucking isn't relevant. What was it? His two things were like one
00:09:12 She is not
00:09:14 She says she's trans, but she also says that she's a goddess and a son of two
00:09:20 therefore she can't
00:09:21 Be trans because she said some other things that are false and
00:09:27 To like she said she is faking it. She said she's a fake
00:09:33 Faking a being a woman or she said she would fake being a woman to get access to lesbians
00:09:40 This this second okay
00:09:42 The first one is like a totally spurious like if you say one thing that's false nothing else you say can ever be true
00:09:49 Yeah, that's like that's real. That's really obnoxious. It doesn't make any sense. It's terrible
00:09:54 The enough said about that the second one
00:09:57 Okay, everyone says this everybody has this same point. They say Chris admitted
00:10:04 Chris admitted that he's just he's just faking it Chris admitted that he is just doing it to get lesbians, okay
00:10:12 Everyone says this so much that I just assumed it was true
00:10:15 When someone when someone actually tried to show me that evidence to show me that quote
00:10:21 It is like one thing it is like one time that Chris said she would like to
00:10:29 She would like to pretend to be a girl
00:10:32 Like and then described like a scenario where like
00:10:35 She had like a slumber party with other girls right to like get less to have like a lesbian slumber party or something
00:10:41 She's yeah, she's it was ten years ago. It was like ten years ago. Oh, so just like yeah, like
00:10:50 Foreshadowing that's the evidence. That's not every that's so stupid
00:10:53 Everyone is everybody says the same thing. They all just accept it. They're like, oh, she said it one time
00:10:59 One time she said, yeah, I would like to pretend to be a woman
00:11:02 I mean, I don't have a lesbian slumber party. It doesn't surprise me at all like their arguments are based off of
00:11:10 Mostly just hearsay and they'll believe it as soon as possible just because
00:11:14 They hate her and they are so convinced. Yeah, they just they're so convinced by that bullet in my gum
00:11:22 They are so convinced and so so many of them repeat that same point that I I
00:11:27 Honestly thought that the evidence that there would be more to it than there is
00:11:31 but like, oh my god, just
00:11:34 Gee, I can't I can't imagine I can't imagine a scenario where like gee, I don't know someone who later on
00:11:44 Realizes that they are a girl or just had to be that they want to identify as as female
00:11:50 I can't imagine a scenario where before they make that decision. Maybe they joke about ha ha
00:11:55 What if I did that or think about what if they did that?
00:11:59 Like I can't that that would blow my fucking mind right there
00:12:03 It's so weird cuz like if that was the even if that was true though, it's it's like
00:12:11 The right like the autonomy of it still wouldn't matter it still wouldn't matter
00:12:16 How do you even know that it's insincere you can't judge that from the outside you can just assume
00:12:22 Based on you know, I don't know
00:12:25 Nothing really
00:12:26 You're just guessing and even if you could tell for example like
00:12:32 It's so like getting into like the minutiae of like philosophically, what does it mean to be a gender or
00:12:39 To like identify as this or that if you do it for X reason is it invalid?
00:12:44 I mean
00:12:46 Yeah, that's a that's a philosophical question
00:12:49 That is not like an obvious yes or no answer, but they're not using it like that
00:12:54 They're just using it as like a cheat like a you know, it's it's just another bullet. It's like it's like I got you
00:13:00 Oh, she did it for this reason. Well, you can't do that. You can't do that for that
00:13:03 That doesn't I've just decided that like anybody I don't like transitions because they want to have lesbian sex instead of
00:13:10 non-lesbian sex
00:13:12 You know is I not actually trans, you know, I just think that like if you want if you are you know
00:13:19 If you are a quote-unquote trans woman. Oh, and you want to have sex with other women
00:13:32 You can just scoot right along there buster
00:13:36 No, no, it doesn't count
00:13:39 It just doesn't count and
00:13:42 I doesn't annoy me. It's just sort of a
00:13:45 Notable that like so many of them they have you know
00:13:50 The that meme that's like the two people talking. I think it's like a a version of like a
00:13:58 Progressive comic whereas a person's like here's how to just
00:14:02 Correct someone when they make a wrong pronoun
00:14:06 Oh, oh the the oh
00:14:09 He and then the lady says she she says like she raped her mother. Oh, excuse me. She raped her mother. Yes
00:14:15 I know they I feel like they post that as if it's like a slam dunk
00:14:19 They they put yeah, they post that as though it's like ha ha
00:14:23 Wouldn't it be silly?
00:14:24 Wouldn't it be like obviously this is what you look like and I'm like it's just right. It's just correct
00:14:31 Yeah, like I literally just right. I feel like they just they they they can't
00:14:37 separate the idea of
00:14:39 respecting
00:14:40 transness and pronoun usage
00:14:44 Concept and they literally and defending they're like they're like from rape accusations cuz we don't it's like it's all or nothing thinking
00:14:52 It's it's all they all they all are like imagine
00:14:55 Imagine defending rape imagine thinking. Yeah, like rape is okay. I'm like, what are you talking about?
00:15:01 You're you're delusional. You're you're having a fucking schizoid episode right now. Like you're literally just making shit up
00:15:07 It you don't live in fucking reality. You imagine it's like. Oh, this is a male murderer
00:15:14 Mmm, probably a female actually. I don't respect their gender. I'm gonna call them a oh she
00:15:19 Wow, I don't want this one to be one of my cis people. So I'm gonna yeah, it's bad
00:15:25 I don't think for this murder to be
00:15:27 He doesn't get he doesn't get to be a cis male anymore now. He's a
00:15:31 Rapist or whatever, you know, like criminal of gender like it's so
00:15:36 Transparenly like a transphobic B. Like like I don't know
00:15:40 Distraction like they just are doing every every realize it maybe
00:15:45 Going through every murderer in history and retroactively deciding that they don't that they don't deserve human respect
00:15:52 And therefore I get to decide that actually they were all trans women, you know, because I'm such an ally
00:16:00 And I just think that would be better that way, you know, oh
00:16:04 man
00:16:06 Wait just to okay. So the thing about the the quote-unquote debate with that fucking guy is that
00:16:14 he he tries to get I he tries to um
00:16:19 You know, he does all these things about like oh
00:16:22 Chris, I don't think he actually said like Chris doesn't have trans dysphoria
00:16:27 I'm not sure if he actually said that but I I got him on I asked him like what makes a trans woman a woman and
00:16:34 I he's he I got him to say he I didn't even have to get it out of him. He said he was like
00:16:40 Okay, I thought he was gonna go the like the the truce camera
00:16:45 I thought he was gonna say like oh they need to be diagnosed by a doctor. They need to have medical dysphoria or whatever
00:16:49 No, he didn't do that. He said
00:16:53 Being a you know identifying as a woman makes you a woman. I was like, okay
00:16:57 So Chris identifies as a woman
00:17:00 therefore QED and like as far as I'm concerned as soon as he said that the argument was one because that's the point if
00:17:09 Making if being trans is is the same as identifying as trans if identifying as trans makes you trans, which it does
00:17:17 then
00:17:18 Chris does that
00:17:20 Therefore, she is a trans woman and it's as simple as that but then he but then he spent then he he spent the next like 10 minutes
00:17:26 Because the video is only like 15 minutes long
00:17:28 Then he spends the next like 15 minutes being like oh, but she says she's a son of you too like oh
00:17:33 But she also says she's a goddess. Oh, but the other thing and like it's all irrelevant
00:17:38 It's all completely aside the point
00:17:41 So I just called him an idiot. I called him an idiot and I and he was like and I you know
00:17:45 I said it I called him an idiot. I said he was being transphobic by doing that
00:17:49 I said all these things and the comments are just like Ben's resorted to insults Ben
00:17:55 Said Ben called him a name. Therefore. He must have lost the argument because like that just means he was losing
00:18:01 but I like I
00:18:04 I
00:18:05 Don't know the the the comments on that video are terrible. They're all like it's I mean it's all his
00:18:11 Viewers, so I guess I shouldn't expect them to be good, but it's really fascinating how like
00:18:18 The the majority of the comments are like
00:18:21 There it's like it's turf true scum shit. It's the same like hmm
00:18:25 Ben is so it's I it's like Ben is soy and not just an event her
00:18:30 Yeah, because he chafed at me call he chafed at me calling him a turf because he was like
00:18:36 Do you know what a turf is?
00:18:37 That's the means of feminists the f stands for feminists, and I'm not a feminine
00:18:42 Literally is one of those
00:18:45 The the the the comments are all most of them are just
00:18:50 Either an insult to me or saying like you know Ben was mad. Therefore. He's he lost lol
00:18:56 How how childish how childish of him to to to use a word a mean word
00:19:03 oh
00:19:04 There was there was the part there was the part where he was like
00:19:08 Ben you there are trans people that disagree with you and you disagree with them you're invalidating them
00:19:16 By doing that, and I'm just like mocking with it
00:19:19 Do you we do trans people agree with me because like he this was he's literally doing like a
00:19:24 Trans people like my trans friends say that it's okay. It's okay for me to be a tur
00:19:30 It's okay for me to be a tur
00:19:33 Okay, anyway
00:19:35 So yeah, that was like oh he he made he made a voice Ben made a voice that he was like making fun of the other guy
00:19:43 With his voice like that's childish and therefore he lost. He is a user
00:19:48 He is soy
00:19:50 Anyway, most of the comments are they're either just yes
00:19:54 They're either just insults to me about that or they are like actually it's transphobic to say Chris is
00:20:01 Trans because Chris is bad and you're saying that trans people can be bad and you that's bad. It's transphobic to say that
00:20:08 so actually Ben is the transphobic one right like that that a lot of it is like that shit and
00:20:14 Then but then these these people who are there to like ostensibly because they care about trying in a stupid and backwards way
00:20:21 That doesn't make any sense and and defeats itself
00:20:23 But like they are attempting on some level to be like pro trans rights
00:20:28 But they're right alongside like the other maybe like 20% of the comments that are just like ha ha lal you're both wrong
00:20:36 Trans people can never can never be meant a man can never become a woman
00:20:39 What makes you a woman is the ability to give birth this whole thing is yeah, that was really
00:20:43 They're all just open. They were like some of them are just openly like not fuck trans people. They're fake
00:20:48 They're all faking it. They're all delusional. They're all they should all be in a mental hospital like
00:20:52 Would you see your who you fucking are see who you're in the fucking on the side with look around you?
00:20:58 And let's see who is who is on the same side of this debate and be like oh wow
00:21:03 I'm arguing the same position
00:21:06 That the people that hate me are arguing
00:21:09 Just a whole okay to Blair whites
00:21:12 Yeah
00:21:14 self-hating
00:21:15 Maybe indirectly, but definitely not helpful to other trans people
00:21:21 They called I called one
00:21:23 true scum trans woman on Twitter. I
00:21:27 Called her Blair white because she was doing the same thing. She was saying they're like
00:21:33 Chris doesn't get to be trans. She's not a real trans person
00:21:36 It is this is this is only hurting real trans people when you let someone be one of them because they say they are
00:21:43 And I called her Blair white and she was like she she said
00:21:47 Like the fact that you think that calling me Blair white as an insult shows that you're the real bigot
00:21:53 And then we got into it
00:21:54 And then we got into an hours-long argument and later on I go and I look at I look at her
00:22:00 Her timeline and on her time was she she made a couple posts about you know how the woke mob were bullying her, right?
00:22:08 She made a couple posts about that and one of them was like
00:22:12 Why do the why do woke ease?
00:22:15 Think why do woke ease think that calling me Blair white is an insult. I would love to look like her
00:22:21 Right, I'd be so happy if I looked like her. Why do they think it's an insult to call me that?
00:22:27 And I'm like wow you know about what you look like you literally just don't understand you
00:22:32 I don't know what is the disconnect here. I don't know why you can't
00:22:38 It's like she's like pro Blair. It's like she doesn't even know what Blair white believes
00:22:42 It's like she like saw a picture of Blair and is like that's a pretty trans woman
00:22:46 I wish I looked and like that was it. It's like now. She's like a flip probe pro Blair
00:22:52 Or something. I don't know
00:22:56 Very that was like I did that was that like on Tuesday or something. I did that it was so cringe the whole debate was I
00:23:06 mean in my opinion like I
00:23:09 Got him. I got him to make the argument for me my arguments airtight. You can't be defeated
00:23:15 He he agrees that identifying as trans makes you trans therefore it follows that
00:23:20 Chris is a trans woman because she identifies as such none of the other bullshit that he tried to say or that anyone tries to say like oh
00:23:27 One time she said she was gonna fake it one time
00:23:31 You know she does all this other stuff blah blah blah none of that matters none of it pokes a hole in the main argument
00:23:37 People people complained at me like oh, but then it was bad optics of you to insult him. It was bad
00:23:43 I don't know. I don't care. I still won my argument won if you if you think it was bad optics
00:23:49 Even though my argument is self-evidently right then like I don't know whoops. What what can I do?
00:23:57 He did he did he did the he did the whole thing he did this is a pet peeve of mine
00:24:01 This isn't just him a lot of people do this and not even on this topic people do this in a lot of context in my life
00:24:06 I have had many people
00:24:08 Do pull this card on me where like I insist on my side of the argument and like
00:24:17 For saying that I am right and for saying that I have reason to think that I am right
00:24:24 They say like oh you're arrogant
00:24:26 Because that's so arrogant of you to just assume that you're right like
00:24:32 You moron he's I'll use him as an example
00:24:34 But you know it is if this goes for any like you fucking moron
00:24:38 We're having this argument because I think one thing I happen to be right, but I think one thing and you think another
00:24:47 How stupid are you?
00:24:49 That I'm like that I like
00:24:52 Insists on what I think and you're like that's so arrogant that you think you're right like what do you think?
00:24:59 Moron you fucking imbecile like what are you talking about like
00:25:04 To to like hone in on that like it's a point that you can add to your tally of like winning
00:25:12 Like Ben there were comments that were like Ben is just Ben just cares too much about being right
00:25:16 You know like Ben is just too he's just too focused on whether he's right or not like what what do you think?
00:25:21 I'm here to talk about what do you think?
00:25:24 I'm here for what did you expect me to say?
00:25:29 Fucking idiots, man
00:25:30 It's all you know all all those all those comments and all the DMs and all the ads that I've been getting on all
00:25:37 Though and all the snarky retweets I've been getting
00:25:40 It's been a lot, but at the end of the day. I just remember like this is all it's all Kiwi farmers
00:25:47 They these are this is the crowd
00:25:50 All of my most negative and like most disgusting interactions that I've ever had online have been
00:25:57 When it's something to do with Chris and a bunch of people like
00:26:01 And a bunch of people get mad at me and they all act they all act this way
00:26:05 This is the worst it's ever been but it has it has happened to other times before and it's it's always this great
00:26:10 It's this like Chris Chris following Kiwi Farms crowd
00:26:16 They're they're just they're just nasty
00:26:18 They're just nasty people. They don't care
00:26:20 They don't care about anything. They'll just
00:26:23 And I just don't I just don't have any respect for them. I don't take their opinion seriously
00:26:27 There was one one thing I want to mention and this was very funny. It was that same person that said, you know
00:26:35 Calling me Blair White makes you the real big it wall
00:26:39 She she said
00:26:42 She she said that I because it was like because I didn't know
00:26:47 When it was something like when Chris said that that thing 10 years ago about like how what if I pretended to be a girl and had a
00:26:53 lesbian slumber party
00:26:56 Totally not an egg thing to say
00:26:59 She she because I didn't know like that line
00:27:02 She said like you got to like learn your chrystery like you're you're a turn you supposed to be a chrystorian learn your chrystery
00:27:08 lull and then and
00:27:10 Then like mere posts later
00:27:14 So she says like
00:27:16 Chris identifies as a son of two and all son of two are male therefore
00:27:22 Chris is not a woman or something
00:27:25 And I'm like, okay first first of all, it's really obvious
00:27:29 It's really obvious that when Chris says oh, I'm son of two now
00:27:33 I'm magic hand now. She is role-playing as another
00:27:36 Character that is not her while like she herself
00:27:40 She still thinks considers Christine the person to be female like it's really obvious that that doesn't shouldn't conflict
00:27:46 Those are like two separate things, but whatever aside from that
00:27:51 Learn learn your fucking chrystery you nerd there are I just put out a lecture
00:27:55 I just put out that you should watch my lecture actually because it clearly explains that there are definitely female son of
00:28:01 Choose and male rosa choose. This is like
00:28:04 Uncontroversial and she she said she said
00:28:09 That's not that's a retcon. That's not widely accepted as cannon and like what are you fucking talking about?
00:28:15 It's in the comic. This is literally it's literally
00:28:19 I know it's it's common to say to accuse like Chris people of like being as dumb as Chris
00:28:26 herself
00:28:26 But like that is literally as dumb as something Chris
00:28:29 That is basically like what Chris tried to do with slime and punishment where she she said like that's not the cannon
00:28:34 This is the cannon. This is her being like no, no, no
00:28:37 Like Chris's only certain parts of Chris's comic actually count like the other parts don't count like those aren't cannon
00:28:43 Like you fucking moron you imbecile you Rube
00:28:48 I
00:28:49 Couldn't believe it. I just I
00:28:52 Just can't fucking believe these people. I have nothing but disdain for them
00:28:57 They their opinions are less than worthless
00:29:01 I just get I just get more and more convinced that I am right the more I see what kind of person disagrees with me
00:29:09 Yeah
00:29:10 At the very beginning I was wondering like how many people were like, oh, you know the news came out and they're like
00:29:19 Just the first thing they hear just happens to be like should we care about the Chris's gender?
00:29:26 I mean they
00:29:28 They're doing some weird shit right now and people like instinctually might be like, oh geez. I guess that I guess it may be not
00:29:35 But no, they seem to all be kind of already fucked
00:29:40 They they really seem to like have a lot of problems
00:29:44 They went into they went into it with a with an image. Yeah, if you if you don't know
00:29:49 Okay, I understand if you don't know anything about Chris and you hear this person
00:29:55 Identifies as a woman and raped their mom
00:29:58 I guess like I can understand why what pops into your head is some like Buffalo Bill asks asks serial killer, right?
00:30:06 And you're like, oh, well
00:30:08 Why would I?
00:30:10 Take their word for it, right like sure, but if you if you know anything if you if you understand anything about Chris
00:30:18 It's not very hard
00:30:20 It's not very hard to see to make to see the
00:30:25 Logical idea that like Chris did these bad things, but also is like very sincere and
00:30:31 Serious about the the gender thing, right? Like whatever else you might think about them
00:30:37 It's just
00:30:39 Simple it's just a simple concept that a certain
00:30:44 category of people
00:30:46 Just simply doesn't have it in them either intellectually or spiritually to wrap their minds around and for that I pity them
00:30:58 Yeah, what what else
00:31:01 What else is there to say oh
00:31:04 Man a half an hour in I didn't expect to spend that much time on it
00:31:10 We never have to talk about it again, which I think we never have to talk about it again
00:31:15 again that
00:31:18 People ask me should should I watch the debate and I was like probably not it's not that funny
00:31:22 It'll just make you mad like no one no ground is gained
00:31:28 If you want if you just want to hear me like loudly and repeatedly
00:31:32 repeat
00:31:34 The truth that could the correct argument that you can't be that wins
00:31:38 I guess you could if you wanted to but there's probably no need
00:31:46 Yeah, they're yeah, you're right now. We never have to talk about it again. What a shit show. Oh
00:31:53 well the the I
00:31:55 Mean I I don't I mean I hesitate to call it harassment, but the the harassment has has is slowing down considerably
00:32:03 It'll probably be a thing of the past pretty soon. Yeah, it's still they'll get bored. I mean, yeah, it's it was just you know
00:32:10 It's not it's funny not even a 20-minute video, right?
00:32:14 It's it's funny that sometimes
00:32:17 Sometimes someone will be like DMing me or adding me or having like a real they seem like really angry at me and
00:32:24 Like as soon as I stop engaging
00:32:26 Maybe I'll check if they were particularly vicious. Maybe I'll check their timeline and I'll see like
00:32:32 immediately they just went back to like some
00:32:35 like just having a totally unrelated conversation or like just retweeting hentai or just like
00:32:40 There was one guy who like immediately like immediately after we stopped talking
00:32:44 He went and like retweeted some hentai and was like, hey, I want her to do that to my dick
00:32:49 What are you? Okay? I guess this was really serious for you
00:32:56 That guy whatever it doesn't matter I
00:32:59 Could I could spend I could probably spend this whole episode going into the minutia of that guy was being a great
00:33:06 This way this lady was being a hypocrite in this other way. I
00:33:10 I have been doing a little something this this last week past week
00:33:16 I've been streaming some more on
00:33:19 Streaming don't give it up give and yeah
00:33:23 Streaming I was streaming
00:33:26 Dark Souls
00:33:27 Randomizer run where you randomize all the items and all the enemy placements and it's really fun because uh
00:33:34 You can have you can do lots of different like settings so you can make
00:33:40 You can make it so that the buses are replaced with different buses, but they try to like make it unique
00:33:48 So you're not gonna get like 20 like see the scale this is through the playthrough. You can get like you'll see
00:33:55 maybe one of each
00:33:57 bus like just in the wrong place
00:34:00 Hmm and also you can have like random enemies spawn boss it as bosses instead
00:34:07 At a as at a percentage and it's just it's been really fun
00:34:12 It's good. Yeah, but wait
00:34:14 You play you play Dark Souls like hundreds of times. I played it. I played it like once I
00:34:21 Played it once just once you played it for the did you you you weren't uh in the dark
00:34:28 No, I was not in the Dark Souls right and frankly, I'm glad I didn't because I saw what Nate had to do to win that shit
00:34:34 And I'm like
00:34:36 That was like a skill-based execution that must have taken like a ton of practice
00:34:42 That I never could have imagined
00:34:45 You both you and Nate love to like grind to tears to get the perfect time
00:34:53 Stupid little PCP show
00:34:55 Honestly, yeah
00:34:57 You can help yourselves. It's it's a shame. It's a shame that like nobody watched the Kirby race
00:35:02 I think I grinded so much to win that Kirby race
00:35:07 Nobody else took it as seriously as I did but I fucking
00:35:11 That was more. I mean the the Pokemon race was not really about I mean, I did grind
00:35:16 I did do the Pokemon run over and over and over again
00:35:19 You know, you know, I actually was probably about equivalent. I spent a lot of time
00:35:23 Actually spent a lot of time grinding on on both of those
00:35:26 What was the other one? There was the Dark Souls race the Pokemon race the Kirby race and there was one more, right?
00:35:31 Uh, was there one more? I don't I think we had plans. I can't remember. What else we did. Yeah, we talked
00:35:37 I thought we did another one in between
00:35:40 Pokemon and Kirby let me have a go look
00:35:43 Mmm
00:35:45 Those those videos were were good. They're memorable
00:35:48 They're yeah, they're good videos
00:35:51 Yeah, but
00:35:53 I mean for me
00:35:56 They were very work-intensive like I spent I spent like all week
00:36:01 For both of them grinding that shit
00:36:04 uh
00:36:05 The the Kirby one I had to discover the like
00:36:09 The the strat of like um getting getting like the randomized like mix-up power and then timing it perfectly to get the exact power
00:36:15 You need for that section is like
00:36:18 You just got to do it over and over and over and over again until you get it right and then you got to execute perfectly
00:36:25 It was fun though. Yeah, we've already we only did I do like grinding
00:36:29 I do I do I do
00:36:30 I do like I guess I kind of do look just like grinding shit out. Yeah
00:36:35 Uh, I guess okay. I guess you only did three. So yeah, the last one's 2017
00:36:41 That's the Kirby race
00:36:43 Wow four years ago
00:36:45 It was it was it's like been a constant thing not not constant
00:36:50 But like every so often I'm like, ah shit those were fun
00:36:54 It sucks that no one can agree on what game to do next
00:36:57 We we did agree on what game to do next we were gonna do doom
00:37:01 um
00:37:03 But that was like a long time ago
00:37:06 I mean
00:37:09 I see I would still be the editor for that I guess because I like doing those
00:37:13 They're fun to like time everything up
00:37:16 But then they would just be you versus tom, which I guess is not a terrible thing
00:37:22 But tom would
00:37:25 Tom would I I mean tom is more familiar with doom than I am so probably probably he would win
00:37:30 I'm also just I'm bad at first person shooters also. So yeah, tom would probably win and like only two people is not as
00:37:38 It's not as good as like six. I think we already have like six people on the pokemon race
00:37:42 Yeah, there were four people in the dark souls race, and I think there were like three on the Kirby race
00:37:47 It was Nate munchie and you yeah
00:37:50 Mike my Kirby strat was like so advanced. It was such
00:37:54 My pokemon strat too. I guess was also extremely advanced. Yeah, you did the funny glitch thing
00:37:59 I did the funny glitch Nate I
00:38:01 Nate Nate like also did the glitch thing, but he only did like the simple version
00:38:05 I did like the full version like the full rock through walls, which is like
00:38:10 It was fun the fun that I got to show that I mean I still think about sometimes how like
00:38:15 When I was doing like practice runs of the block brock through walls glitch
00:38:19 I had that weird visual glitch that like turned me
00:38:22 They're like warped the world and then like turned my sprite into the old man sprite for a second and then like
00:38:29 Powered off and I like am so sad that I wasn't recording because it was such like a
00:38:33 Weird creepypasta sort of sort of glitch moment
00:38:37 Oh, I turned into an old man and then the whole world went like white and then it and then I died
00:38:42 It was like the end of fucking synecdoche, new york spoilers
00:38:46 um
00:38:49 cynic yeah
00:38:51 Yeah, um
00:38:54 Yeah, I don't know. I mean
00:38:55 We could maybe get like have the same like we got gamers tavern. He's a gamer cyber shell is a gamer
00:39:01 Maybe we could have like a pcp guest
00:39:04 race
00:39:05 Including ben and tom
00:39:08 If four people were down to play are you not down to do a doom race?
00:39:12 um
00:39:13 Doom I I mean I guess I could but I like editing them
00:39:17 Actually, no, I did the dark souls one didn't I I participate that yeah, I could I could do doom sure
00:39:23 Well, if if four people if four people were
00:39:26 Down and committed to like yeah, we're doing this doom race. Yeah, I would I would do I would do the doom race
00:39:33 We'd have to think of the rules of like where we go and what version of the game
00:39:37 Um, but yeah, that should be I think it should be tom
00:39:40 I think tom proposed the idea and I think he had an idea in mind for it
00:39:46 I think he's it was like first level and just um
00:39:51 Or something he he had a proposal
00:39:54 When he when he pitched the the doom idea
00:39:56 if yeah, if
00:39:58 I'm just I'll write me in as like potentially down
00:40:01 Write me in as down. I am I am in if if three other people are in and we say we're doing this then I will I will do it
00:40:13 Stay tuned for that it may be maybe maybe
00:40:17 I'll I'll I'll take it in right now
00:40:20 I'll add everyone
00:40:22 I can't believe those three bonus episodes are still not out
00:40:26 I think it's
00:40:27 I think tom's just hasn't gotten around to uploading them. I shouldn't I shouldn't
00:40:32 I shouldn't I shouldn't point the finger, but I think it's literally just like they are made and just like
00:40:38 well
00:40:39 Someone needs to upload them, but also
00:40:42 I said that like we need to
00:40:45 like change the like
00:40:47 url
00:40:48 or change like the um
00:40:51 the um the um
00:40:53 Change because like a lot of like former patrons still have access to the
00:40:57 Videos and we need to like change it so that like, you know only the patrons
00:41:01 Yeah, like to change the url or just like or I think tom proposed like
00:41:05 Instead of making it a playlist that is potentially like the url can be potentially copied and passed around
00:41:12 Make it like a a patreon master post that just like links to every episode
00:41:17 And uh and have that be
00:41:20 The the like the way they're they're accessed
00:41:24 I think maybe that's what we should do is someone will just need to like rewrite
00:41:29 That the patreon post I guess god, I mean, I guess I could just
00:41:33 I guess I could just do that
00:41:35 it was just
00:41:37 So, uh
00:41:41 Yeah, okay, so I should
00:41:43 I guess I should probably just go do that and then we can have those three bonus episodes and then there'll be no problem
00:41:48 Including the one where I grant and rave to cybershell for four hours about how much I hate Tracey
00:41:56 Oh, that one's good. I like that one
00:41:58 I always think that that that way you you were thinking just then
00:42:03 Like like oh, I've got all these things to do. I say out loud to myself or on stream or just somewhere like, oh, yeah
00:42:10 I really have all those things to do
00:42:12 and it's just followed by like
00:42:14 The the the like the deafening silence of me deciding to not do them anyway, even though I'm not doing anything. I like
00:42:22 Uh, yeah, so many things I've got to do. I've got to do those things
00:42:27 I'm trying to be positive and affirmative and be like, yes, those things must be done. I will do them
00:42:33 And now I'll do those things
00:42:36 I mean, you know, there are
00:42:38 In any given week, there are a multitude of distinct things that all you know, uh, uh are
00:42:44 On that level where I'm like, I guess I got to do that. I guess I should do that. Okay. I better do it
00:42:51 And these things conflict with each other
00:42:53 Um, for me, it's mostly the the the phantoms revenge game which
00:42:59 I finished, okay
00:43:01 I made
00:43:03 I made a cutscene. This was like one of the things that I had to do is like I had to
00:43:08 I basically had to program
00:43:11 A cutscene I made one of them. It's like very rough. It's like I sort of like roughly blocked it out and in its basic like timing
00:43:19 So it's not a completed cutscene, but I have one cutscene
00:43:24 Like made enough that it counts and and I consider that to be a win because this is like, okay
00:43:29 I can use this template of how I made this one
00:43:33 I can use this to make I think there's like
00:43:36 Three or four more that I have to do and I can be like, all right
00:43:39 I could basically copy and place this template for how I did it and just and then go back through them and just kind of
00:43:47 You know, fill them out with like the actual nitty gritty of like how I want the sprites to move around and animate and stuff
00:43:54 Which is it's a lot of work, but uh
00:43:56 Having having the the bear the blocks in place
00:44:01 Makes it feel like oh the game is not in an unplayably broken state the game is like
00:44:07 Technically playable and there and it feels like it feels closer to being done having it this way
00:44:14 uh, yeah
00:44:16 uh, man
00:44:19 I can't believe it's been eight months of me making this piece of shit
00:44:25 Okay, it gives me vertigo gives me vertigo when I think about it like that
00:44:29 Dang months. Yeah the fuck I feel like I don't know I've been
00:44:36 Like stationary
00:44:39 For the whole year
00:44:41 Even though I have done things. It's not like a lot
00:44:44 Lord of Ghost Kickstarter was the only one big thing and even that was mostly just making the page
00:44:51 Yeah, I
00:44:53 I feel like that I usually when I'm like I
00:44:57 I
00:44:58 Yeah, I always feel like what have I actually done this year
00:45:01 What when I actually try to think about it like there are things that I have done
00:45:05 But like when I first think about I'm like the year went by and I didn't do anything
00:45:11 The whole like most of the year is gone and I like didn't do anything. What what am I thinking?
00:45:15 It's it's not completely true. My birthday has already happened this year. That doesn't make sense. It's already like summer is nearly over
00:45:24 Yeah
00:45:26 Summer has come at last
00:45:29 The year has gone so fast
00:45:33 Wake me up. I'm gonna cry when September ends. You know how you know what that's how to do
00:45:41 That's how it be sometimes then october ends and then november ends and then
00:45:47 Oh christmas time true true. Um
00:45:54 Um
00:45:56 Have I mentioned
00:45:58 I'm throwing out this there. Have I have I talked about my bit?
00:46:01 on twitter
00:46:03 Where I will pay people to unpledge from Trixie. Have I talked to mention that on the pcp?
00:46:08 I don't think so
00:46:10 Okay, I want to make that I want to announce that here again. Nobody's taken me up on this offer
00:46:15 I don't understand one one guy took me up on the offer
00:46:20 And then I think most people who pledge to Trixie do not follow ben saint on twitter
00:46:26 I know I know I know but one one guy was like I was gonna unpledge anyway
00:46:32 I'm good. I have a one. I'm a one dollar pleasure and I was gonna unpledge anyway, and I was like great
00:46:37 I'll give you two dollars to do it now
00:46:40 And then the next day
00:46:43 I saw her her pledges went down like 15 dollars and I'm just I'm something like if that guy
00:46:49 Whoever that was if they had just told me if they had just told me I'm gonna do that
00:46:55 I would have given them
00:46:57 like 20 bucks
00:46:59 Just just to say that like I paid him to do it
00:47:03 It would have been worth it to me. I wouldn't I would have loved it. We all everyone would have benefited nobody loses in the situation
00:47:11 um
00:47:12 How many man-outs have gone into Trixie?
00:47:16 spite do you think?
00:47:19 Well
00:47:21 I mean
00:47:23 Jeez, let me let me think
00:47:25 Since like march or whatever
00:47:28 It's been like five months
00:47:31 Probably spend a few hours a week on it
00:47:35 so
00:47:37 so uh
00:47:39 How many how many phantom's revenges could have been made with that?
00:47:44 A small fraction of one that's a small fraction of one
00:47:47 um
00:47:49 I I
00:47:51 People people people get on my case people get on my case on twitter and they're like ben this is ben
00:47:56 This is this is too spiteful ben. This is like no

00:48:15 I'm like, oh my god, you fucking idiot you fucking simp g
00:48:19 Yeah, if someone didn't have if someone didn't have
00:48:23 Their patreon money in addition to their like, you know ad revenue and their sub-stack revenue and their
00:48:30 And like all these other like passive streams of income that the average person doesn't have if she were to lose a small fraction
00:48:37 Of of that like god. I don't know what she would do. I don't know what she could possibly do
00:48:45 Right like living with her parents not paying rent getting an allowance
00:48:51 On top of all these other free money
00:48:53 That people just give her that she just makes from the internet like it would be like, oh my god
00:48:58 what if she
00:49:00 Do like like
00:49:01 That would just be it would be it's it's tragic like if you can't you can't do that you can't do that
00:49:05 It's not it's it's it's cruel. It's cruel ben
00:49:08 You're going after her livelihood fuck off
00:49:11 god
00:49:12 Yeah, I imagine like imagine imagine not having that imagine having to like get a job or something
00:49:20 Like what damn if if she had to get a job or something like that would just be the worst thing imagine
00:49:25 That would be the world fate worse than death honestly
00:49:28 It's back to the radio shack
00:49:31 Um, um, wait, no, what was it? This is the target
00:49:35 She worked on a target. Yeah, yeah
00:49:37 target full circle one
00:49:40 One person. I mean, that's what I want. I mean, I I joke
00:49:44 I joke because I I don't actually have the power to make that happen
00:49:48 But if I could snap my fingers and make that happen, I would that is what I want
00:49:52 Uh, let let there be no ambiguity there. Um
00:49:56 Uh, uh one guy one guy really offended me
00:50:01 I hope he's not listening now because I don't I don't really care to call a person out
00:50:05 But I I do want to mention that there's one train of thought
00:50:09 one person was like
00:50:11 G ben, you know
00:50:13 I think your criticism to her valid, but I just can't help but wonder like what if she kills herself and commits suicide
00:50:19 over this bullying
00:50:21 frowny face
00:50:26 He didn't he didn't exact he didn't exactly phrase it as like a
00:50:30 You were actually kind of like killing her
00:50:33 You were actually kind of like forcing her to kill herself ben like went by by like being mean to her on twitter
00:50:40 But like the implication was there
00:50:42 And I went off on that guy because I think I think that's a genuinely like a genuinely like diseased way to think like
00:50:48 I think that was like some sick
00:50:50 sick shit
00:50:51 to say
00:50:52 On the internet. Yeah to put that on someone like casually as well. I think I read it
00:50:57 It was like he it was just it made me feel nauseous. Oh, I don't
00:51:02 Oh, uh, like when you confronted them, they were like, oh, I didn't mean anything
00:51:07 I was just saying it could happen. You know that guy did
00:51:10 I told them that I think he's a sick fuck and he needs therapy, which I do
00:51:14 Um, and he he like kind of apologized, but like frankly
00:51:18 It was a tepid apology
00:51:21 When like he needed to be like he needed to be like ashamed of himself
00:51:25 And like he wasn't he wasn't
00:51:27 Significantly like disgusted and embarrassed with his own
00:51:31 Uh behavior
00:51:32 So I kind of felt like I I wouldn't call admission accomplished there
00:51:38 Uh, I didn't quite I didn't quite impress upon him
00:51:41 like just
00:51:43 just how like
00:51:45 vile
00:51:47 Uh, such such behavior is
00:51:49 But oh well, you can't you can't win them all
00:51:53 Uh
00:51:55 Yeah, I mean
00:51:57 With regards to people giving you shit about it. I don't really mind the spite
00:52:01 So much as the fact that you are wasting time on it because it's not doing I mean
00:52:07 I guess you could say I guess that's that one guy
00:52:10 Unpledge, but I feel like people are unpledging
00:52:13 For other reasons than ben sainte. It's like funny tweet. Well, obviously obviously because they're not even they're not even
00:52:21 Coming and telling me and getting their fucking free money
00:52:24 Yeah, it's free real estate
00:52:27 I don't know you say you enjoy it. Maybe you do. Maybe it's fine. I just I feel like such things are
00:52:36 Are just bad generally like being on twitter a lot
00:52:39 I I is clearly not a good thing to do
00:52:43 I understand
00:52:45 Yeah
00:52:47 I mean
00:52:49 If I could just if I could just be
00:52:51 You know a perfectly logical rational person
00:52:55 Probably the thing to do would be like, you know, if I don't like someone
00:53:00 I just shouldn't
00:53:02 Well, you know, it was kind of spurred on this week by the oh, yeah, the big reveal tricksy finally
00:53:08 tricksy finally, uh, was disgusted enough with the people that like her content to just announce like
00:53:14 Oh, yeah, I deleted it the brony lecture. It's gone. I deleted it. Fuck you. You're never getting it
00:53:19 So, you know, this was, you know, there was a moment of like renewed like
00:53:26 About that. So that that kind of kicked me that kind of kicked me into back into high gear with it this week. Um
00:53:33 You know, I mean you're you're right
00:53:35 It's like the I think it's the the buddhist saying, you know when
00:53:41 Holding on to anger is like being being being spite is like, uh, it's like
00:53:46 Yeah, it's like holding on to a hot coal in your hand thinking that like you'll you'll throw it at someone, right?
00:53:53 Something that is like, uh poisoning yourself hoping that they'll die or something
00:53:59 Yeah, yeah, something like that. I understand
00:54:04 I understand but since since I'm not a rational a fully rational being
00:54:10 Um
00:54:12 I am I am gonna I'm gonna be mad
00:54:15 I'm gonna be mad because I I truly don't think it's uh acceptable
00:54:20 The way she's behaved and so I might as well. I don't know make a funny bit out of it
00:54:25 If there's if there's nothing if there's no way or out of it, I might as well
00:54:30 I might as well make it into I might as well make content out of it. You know what I'm saying
00:54:34 Yeah, no no wasted content here like I can't I can't like moral moral like high ground this because I
00:54:42 I find it funny as well
00:54:45 It would be it would be I I think it's I think it's really funny
00:54:50 I think it's really funny that I can litter that it that one guy actually took me up on it
00:54:55 I wish more would but I the fact that even one
00:54:59 Did it I'm like, okay, that that's
00:55:01 The the bit was worth it was worth it
00:55:04 um
00:55:06 Off offer still open though offer will remain open offer will remain open until
00:55:12 She is back to working at target or bagging groceries
00:55:15 That is the end game unironically
00:55:19 It is the end game, but I know that I I know that I don't have the power to do it alone
00:55:23 So you you have to you all have to lend me your energy
00:55:27 Yes, you have to lend me your energy with this one. We have to do it together
00:55:31 comrades
00:55:37 Well
00:55:38 Yeah, brony lecture brony lecture deleted
00:55:41 Oh, I there was a funny thing. Um, I had I had made
00:55:44 Before she announced that like I deleted it. It's never happening. Well, uh
00:55:49 I had made the the the tier list the lecture tier list
00:55:53 And I had I had thrown in the little easter egg in there where I just I didn't mention it
00:55:57 But I I put a fake I made a fake thumbnail and I put the fake thumbnail
00:56:02 Of the brony lecture into the tier list and I put it in my in like I put it in a rank
00:56:08 Just so that like anyone who was making it would be like wait a minute
00:56:11 Which one is this which one is this and some some people actually fell for it
00:56:15 some people actually were like oh wait wait the bro like
00:56:18 They they recognized what it was and they thought it meant that the that that was out
00:56:22 um
00:56:23 sign and that and that yeah
00:56:27 and then I um
00:56:29 And I I I changed my I changed my twitter handle to brony lecture truth there and I I started posting like conspiracy posts about like
00:56:37 Wait a minute, but but it was referenced in it was referenced in the the the tier list
00:56:43 It's in the tier list
00:56:44 Which was before she said that she deleted it. So like where did it go?
00:56:49 Like why did why is there a thumbnail like there wouldn't be a thumbnail if it weren't posted somewhere?
00:56:53 Oh, who who's hiding the truth?
00:56:55 Um, it's a covet. It's a covet 19 vaccination conspiracy. It's bill gates. It's bill gates trying to silence her
00:57:02 Uh, okay, it's deleted because he has the power to like delete files off of any windows computer
00:57:10 Yes, true true. He has the map the kill switch
00:57:14 Uh
00:57:15 I had some fun with it. I had some fun with it. Um, but boy am I upset
00:57:22 I I kind of I kind of thought
00:57:24 You know this whole time I have known like there is a chance that Trixie has deleted
00:57:29 The the brony lecture and just never thought that it was worth mentioning
00:57:33 Uh, but I I decided that like on the off chance that maybe she hasn't
00:57:38 Maybe it's worth needling her about like, um, you know
00:57:42 Why not post the brony lecture? Your channel is in the fucking toilet. A lot of people want to see the brony lecture
00:57:48 Why not post the brony lecture?
00:57:50 Um
00:57:51 But you know now now I guess it I guess it the I guess she was that was just so offensive to her that now
00:57:58 She's she's confirmed that no it's gone. It's gone. I just write it. Um, so you know, I feel like mission failed
00:58:04 But there was a really deleted it like when she left the pcp in a huff
00:58:10 Maybe
00:58:12 Maybe yeah, probably because that was when it was being discussed
00:58:16 And she just never mentioned it because why would she I guess?
00:58:20 Yeah
00:58:21 Yeah, probably
00:58:23 Again though, you know, she said when she left she
00:58:28 Said on twitter
00:58:30 She made it sound like she left because I was insisting on the brony lecture
00:58:33 That wasn't why she left she left because she left because I said her channel was tanking and that riley was uh
00:58:40 Was was scamming her
00:58:42 Which in hindsight
00:58:44 I I don't I don't think I don't think I think that riley is a scammer anymore. I think he's an opportunist
00:58:50 and I think that he was
00:58:53 Leap leaching off of her true, but like I don't think I don't think he like had a plan
00:58:58 I don't think he like knew what he was doing
00:59:01 Uh, they just they they just they just tanked the channel together
00:59:05 On all of their own but both of them genuinely thinking that they were like rational people doing their best
00:59:15 Incredible if you can that's I've changed my stance. That's what I think now
00:59:19 Lamar
00:59:23 Yeah
00:59:24 Very very very frustrating though to see I mean she to see here like to see here kind of kind of twisted and manipulated
00:59:31 Like that. I don't know but whatever. What what would I expect?
00:59:37 Oh, what if she but what if she what if she sure would be sad if she
00:59:42 Killed herself and committed suicide ben because of you
00:59:46 Sure would be sure would be fucked up
00:59:49 If she were to kill herself because you bullied her ben and it would be your fault
00:59:54 Hmm, wouldn't that be fucked up? Ha ha ha just kidding, but seriously though
01:00:03 Sad sad sad stuff, um
01:00:06 Okay, what what else is what else is on the fucking docket for this week?
01:00:11 I got nothing. I'm sorry. I've got I got like I got locked in my apartment
01:00:16 Oh, my my door knob fell off and I was literally locked in my apartment for
01:00:21 several hours
01:00:23 Until my roommate came home and we were able to like
01:00:27 Do like a two-man like like he manipulates the latch from the outside and I and or like no
01:00:33 And I I manipulate the latch from the inside and he pushes the door open
01:00:37 From the from the outside what I'm mixing up, but you know what I'm saying that we finally did manage to get the door open
01:00:43 So now we can exit and enter
01:00:46 It wasn't that long, but for a while there. I was just like well
01:00:51 I'm fucked the reason why
01:00:54 Uh, I it was when I was I was trying to check my mail
01:00:57 Was when I realized the door was broken
01:01:00 I was trying to check my mail because I was waiting for the arrival of the next thing that I want to talk about
01:01:05 Which is my new credit card
01:01:08 My new credit card, which is the coolest thing that I am obsessed with
01:01:12 I love credit. I love my new credit card. I love credit cards. I love credit card churning
01:01:18 Uh, this is my new thing. This is the the best thing that's happened to me. This is like, um
01:01:23 I I feel like when I when I feel like I just bought a shiny new like, you know
01:01:28 A vinyl like anime figurine like a new piece in my collection
01:01:33 I genuinely feel like I like I'm like admiring it sometimes and I'm like, yes
01:01:37 I feel like it's the same feeling as when you play cookie clicker
01:01:41 And you buy like an upgrade you buy like a all like
01:01:45 Oh, if I if I buy this if I'm saving up for this upgrade
01:01:51 If I'm saving up for this upgrade and I finally get it and now I get like a passive 5 bonus to my cookie production
01:01:57 Yes, I saved up for it and I got it. Um
01:02:01 A passive bonus like oh, this is gonna pay for itself. Um
01:02:06 I again, what's the churning thing you like use it up real quick
01:02:10 No, no
01:02:12 churning refers churning refers to yeah to getting new credit cards
01:02:18 Just to like
01:02:19 Obtain like the sign-up bonuses and then like getting it getting the sign-up bonuses and then just like
01:02:25 Getting a new card and and repeating the process. So like yeah
01:02:29 The new the new card. I just got it's it has a
01:02:33 If I spend like a certain amount within the first three months, I get a 200 dollar sign-up bonus
01:02:40 and I'm I got it now because like
01:02:43 Road to rad con is is being printed
01:02:46 And this is this is why I was looking for the card because I was like, okay road to rad con is is ready to be
01:02:50 It's ready to be printed. I need to pay for the printing
01:02:53 I want to do it with my new with this credit card
01:02:57 So I so I because I have to spend that money on this print stuff
01:03:02 You know, I'm gonna get reimbursed out of the rad con fund
01:03:05 But if I spend if I do it with this card, then that money will go towards my my spend amount
01:03:12 Which will qualify me for this free 200 dollars
01:03:15 of of free money
01:03:17 for spending money
01:03:19 um, so
01:03:20 Yeah, this was this was my strategy
01:03:23 and uh, uh, it's not illegal or anything. It's it's just uh
01:03:28 It's it's just like optimally gaming the the credit card system
01:03:34 So do you have to get a credit card with a different bank or something?
01:03:38 Surely they would notice if you're just doing it over and over again
01:03:42 Well, you can only do it so often
01:03:44 Like yeah, you will you will generally not just be approved for an infinite amount of credit cards
01:03:49 They will like they will start to decline you if you apply for too many too fast
01:03:53 um
01:03:54 But uh, this was the first one I applied for in a while. It just so happened to be with the same bank as the last one
01:04:00 Um, just because this one happened to offer a a can be a sign-up bonus that I could qualify for pretty easily
01:04:06 uh
01:04:07 It also okay, okay, let me explain the difference the difference between my two credit cards is my first one
01:04:14 It did my first one did not have a sign-up bonus
01:04:17 But I got my first one right before I was going to print the um the the vapors two books
01:04:25 um
01:04:26 And it was because it would give me two percent cash
01:04:29 It gives me two percent cash back on everything anything I buy with that card
01:04:33 I just automatically get two percent back as credit, right?
01:04:37 So every everything is just uh is two percent cheaper
01:04:41 The new card there's the sign-up bonus, but also on top it the first one was called city bank double cash
01:04:47 The second one is called city bank custom cash
01:04:50 And the city bank custom cash the way it works is it's when you buy stuff with it. It categorizes the things you buy into like, um
01:04:59 Categories, so they're like, you know groceries
01:05:02 Uh uh streaming services
01:05:05 Uh transportation, uh, you know stuff like that it categorizes it into categories
01:05:11 And then it picks whichever category you spent the most on that month
01:05:17 And then the first five hundred dollars you spent in that category
01:05:21 It will give you five percent cash back on and then one percent
01:05:25 It'll give you one percent on all on every other all the rest that you spent that month
01:05:30 So
01:05:31 The optimal play now I have these two credit card and I have to
01:05:34 Combine them in a way to get optimal cash back
01:05:36 The way to do it is to pick what i'm going to spend most of my money on which I think most
01:05:41 Most months would probably be
01:05:43 groceries
01:05:45 So I will buy all my groceries with the custom cash
01:05:50 I probably don't spend five. I don't spend five hundred dollars a month
01:05:53 On on groceries, but I spend the most so maybe I'll spend like two or three hundred or something on groceries
01:06:00 And I will get five percent back on that two or three hundred dollars
01:06:05 Probably not three hundred. Well, I will get five percent back on that much
01:06:08 And then I use my other card for everything else and get two percent back on everything that i'm not getting five percent back on
01:06:15 That's
01:06:16 And like the more the more cards you get the more you can like maybe kind of like min max
01:06:20 Like what your strategy is to get like the the the optimal cash back reward very very specific credit card for just
01:06:27 netflix or something
01:06:30 Yeah, genuinely. Yeah, like maybe you have a card that just has a deal with amazon and they offer like
01:06:36 You know five percent cash back only on
01:06:40 On streaming services
01:06:41 So you just get that card and you don't use it for anything except you just you pay for your streaming services with it
01:06:48 And then you just get five percent off your
01:06:51 Streaming services and the only the only problem is you just have to remember to pay the bill
01:06:56 um
01:06:57 I mean with most most most of the time with with churning like
01:07:02 You get a card you get the cash back the signup bonus
01:07:05 And then you either cancel it or you just never use it again
01:07:08 So you don't have to worry about about paying it back. You just like oh, I got the bonus. I don't need to use it anymore
01:07:12 Don't no no worries
01:07:16 I don't know this is like genuinely fun and like fascinating in sort of the way that maybe like fantasy football might be to some people
01:07:23 Where you're like meticulously like looking at stats and trying and trying to be like oh, how like how how will this work?
01:07:31 Like what's what's my strategy here?
01:07:33 Uh, uh, um
01:07:36 I don't know it's fucking epic is what i'm saying my new credit card is fucking epic
01:07:41 I uh
01:07:44 The idea of like
01:07:46 Taking care of all of that stuff though
01:07:49 I don't know. I'm not I'm not like that
01:07:52 I think it's it's fun. It's fun for it. This is like
01:07:56 when when I heard about churning I sort of
01:07:58 What when I realized when like I kind of knew this but when it clicked that like wait a minute
01:08:05 if you
01:08:07 If you like manage your credit cards and stuff if you like if you like do your your commerce in a certain way
01:08:13 You can just make it more efficient in a way that is effectively just free money
01:08:17 And like as soon as that clicked in my mind. I was like
01:08:20 why don't I just
01:08:22 Do that in every in every way that it's possible to do it
01:08:25 And I went down the rabbit hole and I found out about churning and I was like, why aren't I churning?
01:08:30 I probably should have been churning. Well the the reason why it's only now that I'm getting my second credit card
01:08:36 And I haven't been churning this whole time is because I've I've been waiting for
01:08:40 Something to require me to make a big part. It was the reason why I got my first one is because I had to make that big
01:08:45 It was like a thousand or two thousand dollars to print all those books
01:08:48 And I was like, well, I might as well get two percent cash back on those on that printing those
01:08:52 And then now now now it's now it's the I have to do the rad con stuff
01:08:55 And I'm like, well, I might as well use this rad con expense to qualify for a cashback bonus
01:09:01 I should definitely do that for
01:09:03 The lord of ghosts things I still have to order
01:09:07 The only thing I have right now is the pins but all the comics and the plush needs to get it's
01:09:12 Got to get it's
01:09:15 When I
01:09:16 You know, I made it into my 30s
01:09:19 Only you're ever using a debit card
01:09:21 I never use a credit card because everyone told me all the fucking boomers in my life told me
01:09:26 You know
01:09:27 Don't don't charge stuff to your credit card. Don't get into credit card debt credit card debt
01:09:32 Will fuck you and like yeah credit card debt will fuck you
01:09:36 But just don't ever get in credit card debt. Just use it like a debit card and pay it back immediately
01:09:41 And then there's no there's no risk of that at all and as long as you're doing that
01:09:45 Paying with credit is just better. It's just strictly better
01:09:49 And even more so if you're getting like cashback on it. So
01:09:54 like
01:09:55 Yeah
01:09:56 Everything you buy you should be using a credit card that gives you benefits
01:10:00 And even more so with like the the big expenses and stuff like printing books and and you know like and business stuff
01:10:08 Um
01:10:11 I'm I don't I'm I'm not sure what my next cards. I'm gonna wait a month. I'm gonna try and wait a month and then
01:10:18 No, I don't know I'll have to
01:10:20 A lot of a lot of the cards that have bigger sign-up bonuses have like very hard like requirements to hit like
01:10:26 They'll get like they'll give you like 500 dollars in credit
01:10:29 But you have to spend like nine thousand dollars in the first like
01:10:34 Three months and I'm like I'm not gonna do that, right?
01:10:38 So on rslash churning, there's a big huge like spreadsheet of like, okay
01:10:44 Here are the most
01:10:46 Here are the most optimal way to like churn to get the maximum cash benefit rewards
01:10:51 But there's there's two problems and there's two things that like kind of ruin this chart for me is that one
01:10:57 By far the most efficient like credit card rewards
01:11:00 You can get are in the form of like travel miles like like free miles with airlines
01:11:05 That's the best like value for money, but I don't travel and I don't use like air travel
01:11:10 So it sort of would be pointless for me to to to do those cards that do that
01:11:15 Unless there were some way to exchange them for cash, which is is not always the case
01:11:20 um
01:11:20 And then the second one is that yeah some cards just have really high requirements
01:11:24 Like you have to spend nine thousand dollars and three months. I I can't do that
01:11:27 So even though those are like the most efficient ones, I have to kind of like skip over those and just be like, okay
01:11:32 But like what can I qualify for? Oh, okay
01:11:35 city bank custom cash
01:11:37 I have to spend 750 dollars to get 200 dollars back. Yeah, I can do that. That's easy
01:11:43 So I don't I don't know what my next churn is going to be but like I'll I'll have to I'll have to mall
01:11:49 Let me know in the let me know in the comments if you've got any recommendations for uh for cards with easy cash back bonuses
01:11:55 And sign up bonuses that I can qualify for on a budget
01:12:01 It's uh, it's like it's like, uh, it's just like outsmarting
01:12:04 It's just outsmarting the banks
01:12:07 That's what it feels like
01:12:09 They're they're like they offer they offer you these they offer you these tempting little nuggets and they're like
01:12:14 Well, um sign sign my bargain sign this this bargain young man
01:12:20 Sign this this deal with the devil and and and we'll give you yes
01:12:24 We'll entice you we'll entice you with free money
01:12:27 But you know they do this with the expectation
01:12:30 That you will like fuck it up
01:12:31 You will violate the terms of the contract and then they can be like, aha. There was a secret clause
01:12:36 Now you're now you're in debt to us for life now we get your soul now you owe us all this interest
01:12:41 But if you if you just if you just
01:12:45 You just don't you just don't fuck it up. You do it exactly by the rules you beat them at their own game
01:12:49 You can just get free money out of them
01:12:53 And it's so based this is my new fucking thing. This is the new credit credit card podcast
01:13:00 Oh speaking of boring speaking of boring money shit that nobody wants to hear about. Uh, it's time for ben's bitcoin crypto corner
01:13:09 Update uh, everyone was wrong everyone was wrong to criticize me. It has in fact risen slightly
01:13:16 Since I bought yes, I did notice
01:13:19 So it was go it was trickling down, but it had another
01:13:23 Not a huge spike, but it spiked up above where it's still
01:13:27 It's the trend is still overall bearish. I am
01:13:30 I am considering that like maybe
01:13:34 This is made like like trading volume is kind of low. So maybe that means that this is a
01:13:40 temporary peak
01:13:42 And that it is
01:13:44 bearish
01:13:45 It is relative in fact bearish
01:13:48 Uh, bearish bearish means it's gonna go down bullish means it's gonna go up. Oh, okay. Yeah, I
01:13:54 I mean last
01:13:56 Last episode
01:13:57 I thought that it it it it definitely had slowed down
01:14:02 And then it was go and right after the episode
01:14:05 It went down, but then it's shot up again a little bit only on bitcoin though
01:14:09 On a theory it's just been going down
01:14:12 Really?
01:14:13 Well, not totally it did go up at the same time as bitcoin, but didn't go quite up
01:14:17 that much
01:14:20 So I guess I'll post the graph
01:14:23 It's not so bad that I sold
01:14:25 But I am worrying. I'm you know, you can't help but worry. They're like, oh shit
01:14:29 What if it does explode out of nowhere with no warning and no like you couldn't have been expecting that to happen
01:14:36 Yeah, and then I would have missed out on on all the money, but
01:14:39 This is this is um
01:14:41 Yeah, so I I bought in I bought in like last week at around
01:14:46 47 k and now it is it has been hovering around like 48 49 k
01:14:51 Uh this week. So, you know, it's up a little bit. It's not a huge gain or anything. Um,
01:14:57 It could it could crash at any moment. It could crash at any moment
01:15:01 But like yeah, like is is it gonna crash?
01:15:05 Is it gonna go to 100 k before the end of the year? Like either one of these things could happen
01:15:10 and
01:15:12 yeah, like
01:15:13 Sure, like investing in bitcoin is risky because it's volatile
01:15:17 but the the flip side of that
01:15:20 The flip side of that is that
01:15:22 Like not being in the this is this is the catch 22 not being invested is kind of just as risky because if
01:15:31 You don't have bitcoin and it explodes
01:15:34 You've lost money just as surely as if you were invested in bitcoin and it crashes
01:15:40 I mean, I guess it's not exactly the same because in one case your absolute number is going up versus down
01:15:46 but in terms of like in terms of like opportunity costs like
01:15:51 They're they're cut. They're pretty similar, right? So this is how I'm like
01:15:55 I feel like
01:15:56 I don't know the future
01:15:58 It could crash it could grow to it could just keep growing and growing it could explode again. Um, I feel like
01:16:06 Maybe maybe this is cope, but I feel like the the sensible thing to do they say diversify your assets, right?
01:16:12 like
01:16:13 If I if I have some a little bit of bitcoin and it crashes
01:16:16 Well, I lost some money
01:16:17 But if I have a little bit then if it if it if it explodes then I didn't lose out. So I feel like
01:16:23 I don't feel like I'm being um
01:16:26 too, uh, too, uh, uh
01:16:30 Unreasonable
01:16:33 Yeah, I don't know. Yeah
01:16:36 Well, your reasonableness makes sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah explainable
01:16:41 Next next week it might go to 20 and I'll be like, well
01:16:46 Shows what I know
01:16:49 God, I hope not
01:16:50 I mean if it does, I'll be happy because then I'll be like, ah, Pog it's so low
01:16:55 Pledge get get back in
01:16:57 I feel I feel so shitty because I was I was looking at it casually like last
01:17:03 In July I saw it going down to
01:17:06 I saw it approaching 30 and I considered maybe I should buy in when it hits 30
01:17:12 But I I was like, no, I think it's gonna keep going down
01:17:15 I'm gonna buy in when it hits 20 and then low and behold it hits 30
01:17:21 Hover's bounces back and has just been steadily climbing since then and has almost hit 50
01:17:26 If I had if I had just bought in then if I had just bought in then when I was thinking about maybe doing it
01:17:32 You know, that's just how it is. That's just how I go. I would I would have been like I would be at fucking
01:17:37 Fucking 160 percent or whatever
01:17:41 My profits would be skyrocketing
01:17:44 I'd be a regular brad garling house
01:17:47 Uh, but uh, it is what it is
01:17:50 It is what it is unfortunately
01:17:53 So, okay, that's all I have to say about that. Oh, but on the last
01:17:57 subject
01:17:58 On the on the subject of money on the subject of gold. I did a noita
01:18:04 Challenge run. I did a no gold run
01:18:07 Uh, where I did not obtain any gold
01:18:10 and it wasn't
01:18:13 That hard it was kind of hard
01:18:15 But I was I was trying to do a pacifist run for a while and that was really hard
01:18:20 because
01:18:23 The pacifist run is annoying because there are some things that will
01:18:27 Usually count as you not killing something
01:18:31 like
01:18:33 Kicking kicking an object into some an enemy and crushing them with it. I don't think that counts as
01:18:40 Killing them but throwing something throwing a tablet out of your inventory and crushing them
01:18:45 I think that does count as a kill as or as a deliberate kill most of the time
01:18:51 Or at least some of the time
01:18:53 and i'm not and i'm not exactly sure of the rules because
01:18:57 It it's not always consistent like whether something counts as a double as a as an environmental kill and and gives you double gold or not and it's like
01:19:07 The thing about the the pacifist run is
01:19:10 You you can't even you can't even kill the final boss you you have to
01:19:15 You have to get the final the thing from the final boss
01:19:19 Not kill him and then make your way to you have to make your way to the like win zone on your own
01:19:26 Which is actually very difficult like like you have you would have to um
01:19:31 Dig your way you have to dig your way to it through all this stuff. You need black holes. You need like advanced stuff
01:19:37 so you you have to be like
01:19:40 Doing the pacifist run you have to be prepared not just to win the game
01:19:43 Which is relatively easy, but you have to be doing like post endgame
01:19:47 like
01:19:47 you know like
01:19:49 Game manipulation or not game manipulation, but like environmental manipulation stuff in order to actually
01:19:55 Reach the place where it will count you as having
01:19:58 gotten
01:19:59 You know the pacifist run so that one was too hard. So I set my sights down lower
01:20:04 I needed the no gold around and I got it baby. I fucking got it. So
01:20:09 mission
01:20:10 Accomplished
01:20:13 So i'm rich in real life, but i'm poor in noida. That's that's the takeaway
01:20:18 Wow
01:20:20 Wow, I know what you did. I understood
01:20:23 I really did
01:20:25 Is that I you're being sincere, right? No. Oh
01:20:29 Okay, I genuinely wasn't sure
01:20:33 Okay, um
01:20:36 I just didn't get any gold. I just beat the game without getting any gold
01:20:39 You didn't get any gold for sure. Imagine just imagine what that entails and that's what I do. I can't purchase any
01:20:46 drinks
01:20:47 Can't purchase any no can't buy any wands
01:20:49 you you can
01:20:51 You can't buy wands, but you can steal spells and this is what I did you you can if you
01:20:57 Because like when you get to the holy mountain the wands are floating
01:21:01 You can't move the wands, but the spells
01:21:03 They're in like the shop area and you can buy them
01:21:07 But if you dig the ground out from under them they fall and if they fall out of the holy mountain
01:21:12 They become free and you don't have to pay for them
01:21:14 So I did I did some of that where I like used luminous drill to dig them out and then just pick them up for free off the ground
01:21:19 That's a bit of a
01:21:21 I mean, it's not a cheat. It's in there deliberately, but that's a bit of a
01:21:24 kind of like
01:21:26 A cheeky little strap that they let you get away with
01:21:30 Uh, I didn't use it that I think I used it for some drills or something to like speed up my rate of fire
01:21:36 Oh, no, there's a chainsaw. I found a chainsaw in a in a and I was like, well, I need that
01:21:41 And then I got and then I got a and then I got a chainsaw running with triplicate bolt
01:21:45 and then I with a mana re recharger and then I was just
01:21:48 machine gunning out like triplicate bolts in a fucking
01:21:51 Blast and then I found and then I found a glamour. I found a green glamour spell
01:21:55 So instead of shooting out little little green
01:21:58 Bullets I was shooting out like green like
01:22:01 Like like energy like beams like green little little sparkly energy beams
01:22:05 Uh, and then I went up to I went up to uh, what's his name? Um, um,
01:22:09 Cole me I went up to Cole me and I was
01:22:11 Was eviscerated him
01:22:13 Uh, that was that was those were the those were the days. That was uh, that was a good one. No, I'm done
01:22:19 I'm done with noida. I'm done with all the things I had on my little uh talk about list. So
01:22:24 I don't know. We could go to voicemails or what? Yeah, I I feel kind of stupid. I didn't have anything to talk about today
01:22:32 I'm not not not feeling very good either
01:22:36 Mmm
01:22:38 What a what a terrible episode
01:22:40 What a terrible episode. Oh, I'm so sorry about the terrible episode everybody
01:22:45 It's okay. As always. I carried as always. I carried us over the finish line
01:22:50 Uh, I brought I brought the heat
01:22:53 Uh, uh, uh, you know
01:22:56 I had you know, I get it. I don't worry. I got enough twitter arguments to to this week to to fill a whole episode
01:23:04 No wasted no wasted content. Oh, you should you should get even even more twitter arguments
01:23:10 So you have even more content. That's what it's all about, baby
01:23:14 This is what it's all about. This is what it's all about is just building
01:23:17 A lifestyle that reinforces the the toxic and like useless behavior that I that I want to be engaging in
01:23:25 That I am addicted to engaging in I need to build my life around
01:23:31 Incentivizing myself to continue to do those things like like making content out of complaining about obnoxious twitter arguments that don't accomplish anything
01:23:40 Um, that's how you fucking do it
01:23:43 Yeah, let's let's let's go to voicemail
01:23:47 Okay

01:25:55 Chris could have Chris could have 10 years ago
01:25:59 concocted a plan to to uh to pretend to be a woman
01:26:04 And and then executed it flawlessly

01:26:12 I just what I pointed that one lady
01:26:15 She was like
01:26:16 She gave me the link to like the time that chris said that thing 10 years ago
01:26:20 And I was like it's 10 years old you psycho and she was like
01:26:25 Pre-meditation bitch
01:26:28 You're insane. You're deranged. Yeah pre-med
01:26:31 She was like this just proves pre-meditation the fact that it was 10 years ago only proves that it was deliberate this whole time
01:26:39 Genuinely get help
01:26:42 Get help. Um, the next one is a youtube link. Um
01:26:48 I think
01:26:50 Oh, it's it's that pardon jesse's video where he yells at the thing
01:26:55 And let's just says funny words directed it towards certain individuals
01:27:02 Well, I mean
01:27:05 He sure did
01:27:07 He sure did
01:27:08 It's funny
01:27:09 My hands are not entirely clean in this regard and I cannot throw stones
01:27:14 Um
01:27:15 Same
01:27:16 What what can I say? What what can I say? I mean, uh, oh, this this is called at poorly aged stuff
01:27:22 Sure. Yeah, but point point made point made
01:27:27 um
01:27:28 Okay, next one is called the ruthless aggression arc
01:27:32 uh, wait, um
01:27:35 I mean to download the why did I download that one? It was just a youtube link. Uh
01:27:40 No, no rename. No delete it for my files
01:27:43 Okay, next one is called the ruthless aggression arc three two one go
01:27:48 It's time for a new tommy j arc because we're bored. We're bored of the last tommy j arc
01:27:55 Everybody's obviously bored of it. Oh
01:27:59 Oh, we ate this up. We ate this fucking pcb comment show shit up up the last seven times
01:28:05 He did but this time it got old anymore. It got old. I'm sorry. This is a minute 30
01:28:12 This is a minute 30. We actually didn't want you to do anything at all. Well, well, you know what?
01:28:18 You know what? This is a narrative. It keeps fucking going. I keep doing this shit
01:28:22 And it it always has to do not understand the concept of it got old
01:28:27 The longer it goes the older it becomes the fucking mystic marbles guy
01:28:31 And there's some other repeat offenders these people who in the who are just like, okay. Yeah, okay. I get it other people made
01:28:38 Other boy smells that weren't as annoying. So why are you the only one that people get not the only one?
01:28:44 Why are you the one that people are annoyed at currently? I don't know. Okay. I stopped listening. Uh, all right
01:28:50 reflect on yourself
01:28:52 Next one is a fast upload link
01:28:57 and um
01:29:00 ineffectual versus intellectual I will say that
01:29:04 You know what?
01:29:05 I wasn't gonna mention it, but I don't I don't care anymore. Tommy j sent me a dm on twitter wherein he claimed that like
01:29:13 basically he was only pretending to be an annoying voicemailer and like
01:29:19 It was all a bit. He was playing a character of a terrible voicemailer
01:29:24 He did a very good job. He did a really good job
01:29:31 Uh, so whatever it's fine. Uh, whatever. No, it's it's fine. It's great. Okay
01:29:38 Just
01:29:40 Just I don't know. I don't want to make too big an issue of it. I don't want to like I don't want to call
01:29:46 Him out. He's not a fucking terrible person
01:29:48 Just because he made a couple annoying voicemails, but like have a little have a little humility and just like when people say like
01:29:55 I'm sick of this bit
01:29:57 Just be like, okay. Sorry
01:29:59 Just have a little humility about it. I think that's what's what's missing here. Okay. Um, next one is called ineffectual versus intellectual
01:30:07 three two one go
01:30:10 You an ineffectual all the best like deals all the best situations you get in life because like you knew someone and they were like
01:30:18 Oh, hey, I can hook you up get a friend who's got a job doing that and they recommend you
01:30:23 And then you get a job and you just get like pretty good money networking. It's important
01:30:28 Yeah, yeah, the uh, the reputation of specific artists, right is what actually drives the prices skill really doesn't matter
01:30:36 I an intellectual
01:30:38 Fuck all these people. They're all in a big club and i'm not in it. Uh, it's all about who you know
01:30:43 It's it's all bunch of those are the same thing
01:30:46 Those are the same thing
01:30:50 Uh in ineffectual
01:30:54 I don't know what that would
01:30:56 I mean like they're saying
01:30:58 the clips of of various pcp members saying
01:31:02 Uh networking, it's who you know and then the second one is it's who you know and I don't like that
01:31:07 I'm not who they know. It's the same thing
01:31:12 Yeah, it sucks that that's how it works, but you've got to do it. That's just sort of normal
01:31:17 The the first is me the well me and others saying this is how it works
01:31:22 The second is me complaining that that's how it works. I don't this this reminds me of um
01:31:28 Um
01:31:29 This reminds me of okay, Sean
01:31:32 It all comes back to Sean. You're Sean made it made it. I think it was like two weeks ago or something
01:31:36 I saw this Sean tweeted that like
01:31:41 He he made sort of a jokey tweet that like his guilty pleasure
01:31:45 Was like seeing seeing like in basically look seeing incels like self-defeating ideology where they let they convince themselves that they are like a
01:31:53 An undatable monster because like, you know, they're they're like only five foot nine and not five foot ten or whatever, right?
01:32:00 He said like that's a guilty pleasure of his and then
01:32:05 Like a couple days later. He made
01:32:08 Another tweet that was like critical of incels. He like he said that like, you know, he said that
01:32:15 I don't remember what it was, but it was something to the effect of like
01:32:17 Yeah, this incel ideology is is a problem. You know, it's it's not rational and you know, it's it's bad that people think this
01:32:24 and I saw people
01:32:26 being like calling him a hypocrite
01:32:28 and seeing like the hypocrisy is so obvious
01:32:32 because
01:32:33 He's because on the one because first he said that he
01:32:37 liked that he got entertainment from something
01:32:40 and then later he said
01:32:43 that it's not a good thing and like
01:32:46 There's no contradiction there at all. I saw so many people being calling Sean a hypocrite because
01:32:52 He said that on one hand his guilty pleasure is is enjoying seeing this flawed thing
01:32:57 And then the second was him saying that the thing is flawed and those are like kind of the same idea
01:33:03 And this this is I mean, this is honestly, this is just obviously this is the same
01:33:07 I don't
01:33:08 I'm not sure how seriously to take the criticism that this uh that this voicemail is offering me
01:33:13 But those just seem like the same thing. I couldn't even really tell if it was a criticism
01:33:18 at first
01:33:19 It might be I mean, I guess I suppose clips are you
01:33:23 Yeah, I mean, I think it's a joke, but like
01:33:28 I don't I don't know
01:33:30 um
01:33:32 The intel the intellectual I guess the point is that
01:33:37 The second one
01:33:39 I honestly I could I can't tell if it's ironically calling the second one the intellectual point like the intellectual
01:33:46 Like the smart thing is to say like fuck it
01:33:48 And the and it's it's dumb to be like
01:33:51 Oh, you got a network. You got a network. You got to know people and it's
01:33:55 And it's smart to be like
01:33:56 Fuck knowing people. It's all a big club
01:33:59 Or if it's ironic and the actual opinion being espoused is the exact opposite of that
01:34:04 I could see it going either way
01:34:06 um
01:34:07 I don't know
01:34:08 Lamal
01:34:09 I let let's let's just move on. I mean being not in big clubs is annoying
01:34:14 I think we can yeah, it's terrible
01:34:16 This is the this this is the fucking
01:34:18 Tragedy of my whole life is that I'm not in a big fucking club
01:34:21 This is the tragedy of like almost everyone's life actually is that they're not in the big club where you get access to
01:34:28 You know, what whatever life?
01:34:30 Well, I mean I have access to normal life. I don't have access to like
01:34:34 Uh
01:34:35 Big media big media big media collections or something like that. Right. Sure. Yeah, right exact. Yeah, that
01:34:42 That's what it's all about. It's all about getting those poggers connections
01:34:47 Ah
01:34:48 Next voicemail is called elwood edwards
01:34:51 three two one go
01:34:55 So I listened to nate's new podcast and here are my thoughts. It's a bunch of idiots
01:35:00 Talking about especially signs. They do know about getting into topics
01:35:04 They know nothing about where they're contradicting themselves and spreading misinformation
01:35:09 Just making everyone listening dumber in the process
01:35:12 With some cringe moments sprinkled. Okay
01:35:15 So it's basically exactly the same as this podcast and I'll be happy to listen to hundreds of episodes faced
01:35:21 Anyway, crack was good last week. You should have him on more. That was like that was like through two weeks
01:35:27 I don't know. Okay. Uh, this must have been. Yeah, okay. Um
01:35:32 Cracks cool
01:35:33 Cracks are really cool guy. Cracks are really smart guy. I like crack a lot. Yeah. Yeah
01:35:38 Uh, yeah, that sounds that sounds like about
01:35:42 That sounds that sounds about like what I would expect a nate podcast to be
01:35:46 So, you know good good for him. I guess uh lemal
01:35:51 Next one is called alaskan weeb
01:35:54 three two one go
01:35:57 Hey guys, like fuck Trixie and all that but also I was listening to the
01:36:04 Like two weeks ago podcast and then it's just unrelated and
01:36:07 It might be the only one who finds it a little bit hilarious that despite Trixie being the one who gets
01:36:12 Blastered with labels like pedophile and all that her ex-wife is the one who tried to sleep with the teenager
01:36:18 Am I the only one who's finding this little cherry on top of this disgusting?
01:36:23 Sunday to be just
01:36:25 So good and then the fact that she's
01:36:28 Aligning herself with the kind of people who scream save our children save our children
01:36:32 When she's the kind of person that they're trying to save their children from
01:36:36 I mean, I don't know. I'm who's just thinking I mean
01:36:41 You'll you'll you'll get you'll get no defense of may from me
01:36:45 I I do okay. I don't I don't know really that much about the situation. I I thought that the girl
01:36:52 That may have sent those creepy creepy
01:36:55 like DMs trying to uh trying to like
01:36:59 Trying to like emotionally three some pressure emotionally pressure this like yeah this like
01:37:05 This like fucking battered woman into having a threesome with like her ex-wife her ex-husband and her together
01:37:12 Like I thought those creepy emails were I thought the girl was 18
01:37:17 I think
01:37:18 I think I mean, I think Ethan was probably like fucking her before she was 18
01:37:22 I think might might be legal depending on the state. So that's not a criminal. That's not necessarily a criminal allegation
01:37:29 um, but uh
01:37:33 The the I thought she was 18, but I mean
01:37:38 I mean, yeah may may is terrible and
01:37:42 I don't know what else to say
01:37:44 May is an impressively terrible may is terrible person
01:37:48 May is uh save our children save our children stop the steal big nick fuente's fan big fucking white
01:37:55 Oh, man. I should I mention the
01:37:57 The the tweet the tweet she made when when she announced did I mean I don't think I think this was this week
01:38:02 When she announced her being pregnant. She said like she said that it never never been never been a better time
01:38:09 It's the perfect time to have a baby
01:38:11 It's the best time to have a baby and she linked to the census stats showing that like the amount of white people in america has declined
01:38:18 She's literally she's literally
01:38:21 She's literally saying like I need to start having babies to protect the white race. There's no subtext there
01:38:27 She's just she's just out to like save the white race. This is just unironically what she's about. I think
01:38:35 I really think
01:38:37 I I know it's it's it might it might seem a little bit
01:38:42 It might seem a little hypocritical of me
01:38:45 Because I was never this hard on may before but if you like used if you used to like may
01:38:50 I I was I never liked me
01:38:52 I never I never like publicly criticized her because she never like had a real opinion publicly until a certain point
01:38:58 And then she did but if you if I feel some people say like I used to like may I used to like may on like the
01:39:04 Whatever their fucking side channel was called if you used to like may I think you're an idiot
01:39:08 I really think you are you are there's
01:39:10 You fucked up and you need to like reflect and like think about like what's wrong with you that made you have that opinion
01:39:15 I really think she's that bad even honestly even aside from just her like nightmarish politics
01:39:21 She also just sucks in general
01:39:23 Um, but then all she's also a nazi on top of it. So, you know, it's a real
01:39:28 It's a real layer cake
01:39:30 of problems
01:39:33 um
01:39:35 Anything you want to add
01:39:37 uh
01:39:38 No
01:39:39 Okay, next
01:39:41 Next fucker next voicemail is called toxic three two one go
01:39:48 I don't watch the pcp anymore. I've seen some of the most recent episodes tommy
01:39:54 And i'm not gonna watch it's a minute 30 of any more of it
01:39:59 And i'll tell you why this is a dent to like a pcp currently
01:40:04 reminds me
01:40:06 Of a fucking high school girls
01:40:10 I kind of want to see where's going with this
01:40:12 Oh, i'm just doing me. You just do you or i have my art you how you are
01:40:19 And our artists or our guests they got there
01:40:23 Yeah
01:40:25 That's true
01:40:27 No, that's not actually what's going on here. It's it's it's a veneer
01:40:34 that you use to
01:40:36 Make it seem nicer and it actually is this was actually going on
01:40:41 Is that there's the purse there's the king
01:40:44 There's the queen b
01:40:46 Ben
01:40:47 What and then everybody else is just looking for
01:40:50 For opportunities looking for weaknesses looking for slip-ups things that you weren't supposed to say
01:40:57 And then when the moment is right someone strikes and then they get clout
01:41:03 They're clout facers
01:41:05 Oh, you're a liiib ben
01:41:08 Ben's kind of cringe now. I don't know
01:41:12 I don't have no idea
01:41:14 But you made this this is all you this
01:41:20 It's that's a that's a
01:41:23 That's a bit. It's it's some kind of a bit, right? I I think so
01:41:27 The silly voice makes me think it's it's got to be some somewhat of a bit
01:41:32 I I don't know what the bit is. I couldn't really get a grasp of what the character
01:41:37 The bit I just feel like it's someone like what if there was a character who had no idea what the hell they were talking about
01:41:43 What a great bit
01:41:46 The bit is that the pcp
01:41:49 Is it is a high school girls club?
01:41:52 Okay, so so we pretend to be nice to each other
01:41:54 But actually we're all here to try and like tear ben down for clout. I guess he said it
01:42:00 He said I was the he said I was the queen b
01:42:03 He didn't say who the he said there was a king and that I am the queen b. Who's the king?
01:42:09 um
01:42:10 And then
01:42:11 Who who's who's trying to tear me down you you and tom the guests?
01:42:15 Yeah, who you haven't noticed
01:42:18 Uh, of course
01:42:20 I'm always on it's because I never let my guard down. It's because I never have any weaknesses to exploit
01:42:24 That's the secret. It's just like when you sign up for a credit card
01:42:27 All you get you just never let give any weaknesses for the banks to exploit
01:42:31 You just never fail the Faustian bargain you keep to all the terms and then you trick them out of their money
01:42:35 You never let them get you. Um
01:42:38 I don't know. I I could I guess I could ponder this
01:42:42 I guess I could ponder the intent behind this this voicemail all day, but maybe it's maybe it's not worth it
01:42:48 Uh
01:42:53 Okay, the next one is a is an imager link. It's an it's another beam
01:42:57 It's the same
01:43:00 Same fucking they're doing it on purpose now. They're doing it on purpose. Okay. I like it now
01:43:06 Wait, okay. Um, we've got you surrounded stop drawing
01:43:10 Yeah, I love draw. Okay. You know what?
01:43:14 You know what actually this one's pretty funny
01:43:17 Mesh did she she did be drawing
01:43:20 She did be drawing during the podcast. She did be drawing during the podcast and you know what?
01:43:25 Can't I can't even begrudge her that I can't okay, so this time we got me for sure
01:43:31 Yeah, and we got you and then you there's only fucking fruit flies. Why are there fruit flies in my room?
01:43:36 Where they fucking come from fruit probably
01:43:40 There's no
01:43:41 Are you calling me a fruit?
01:43:43 I'm calling you a person who buys a fruit
01:43:46 Do you not buy fruit?
01:43:48 Is it not pito? Sometimes I buy a tomato. That's a fruit, but I don't keep it in my room
01:43:54 Oh, oh, yeah
01:43:56 Oh, okay. Okay. There's you and me and that's gotta be taboo
01:44:00 Probably and then mate. That's I guess it's the sunglasses and then I'm not really sure who that should be at the bank
01:44:09 Is it Trixie?
01:44:12 It doesn't seem like it would be Jesse
01:44:15 It doesn't look like Tom or Jesse
01:44:19 I think it's gotta be Trixie. Yeah, it's gotta be Trixie, but it's a very strange face
01:44:25 It is a very strange. I don't know this meme. Is this a meme that this person has drawn or is it an actual meme that other people make?
01:44:33 Were you were you on last week?
01:44:35 I've seen another version of this
01:44:37 There yeah, this this is a meme. This is a meme that I I saw around
01:44:43 Like on twitter and stuff a while ago
01:44:45 I didn't really get it and the more versions of it. I see
01:44:50 I feel like the the less I understand it
01:44:55 I think it's like the people coming through the door
01:44:59 Are coming to get the person behind the table
01:45:03 for
01:45:04 Whatever they're doing and the person behind the table
01:45:08 Is insane and is still doing it
01:45:11 Well, sometimes it's that but sometimes they're like they're doing the opposite of it or they're saying something like
01:45:17 else they're saying
01:45:20 I guess the idea is that the person
01:45:23 I think okay. I think the the intent of the meme is to poke fun at the person behind the table
01:45:30 for because they they think
01:45:33 That people are out to get them for something
01:45:36 So like you literally depict these people like cia agents busting through your door coming to get you for whatever it is
01:45:42 Right. I I think the idea is that the person behind the table is crazy because like ha ha. This is what you think
01:45:48 Like you think this is what's happening
01:45:50 That's that's my interpretation
01:45:53 and it's
01:45:54 true
01:45:57 Where's the door have like little arms?
01:46:00 The door frame has like a weird arm. It looks it looks like a coat rack. It looks like yeah
01:46:06 It doesn't look like a door or like a clothing rack like a long pole
01:46:13 I like mage's I like mage's face a lot and this one. Yeah, she looks great. She looks great. Um, okay, uh, yeah
01:46:22 mage do be she do be drawing though
01:46:25 next next voicemail, uh is uh
01:46:29 Wait, where did I?
01:46:31 Oh, I fucking tabbed off the here we go. Um, next voicemail is called jabroni 101
01:46:37 three two one go
01:46:40 Well, we're finally here. Aren't we pcp fans a year and a half later?
01:46:44 And we finally get confirmation of what we all should have known all along
01:46:49 Which is that the brony files have been deleted, you know tweeted as tricksy mentions themselves
01:46:56 And you know, what were we thinking right guys, you know
01:47:00 They gave the middle finger to the fans and they said in the radcon for discord
01:47:05 I don't have to respect people just because they gave me money
01:47:08 And you know, they're gonna reshoot the lecture supposedly with a different audience and oh boy that video totally won't get this like bombed
01:47:15 Am I right guys?
01:47:17 I would love I would
01:47:19 I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's all true. Um
01:47:22 I
01:47:23 I would I would love
01:47:26 To see because yeah back back in the day well back in the day
01:47:29 Because she changed her story a bunch of times
01:47:31 She's like at first she said that she wanted to heavily edit the lecture then she changed the story to
01:47:38 I want to
01:47:40 Film new footage to combine with the old footage
01:47:44 Then it was just I want to just completely rerecord it
01:47:49 And and I'll let my and Riley will make red con five will produce red con five and you should all come and I'll let my and I'll let
01:47:55 My crony throw a throw a rap concert which rad con five will be like a side attraction for
01:48:04 And then we'll do it there. I guess
01:48:06 um, and then it was
01:48:08 Radio silence for like months and months
01:48:11 And then it was I've deleted it lemal and but then when she after she announced that she deleted someone asked her about it and she said
01:48:18 she said like um
01:48:20 I've she said something like I've said I've said before that I was interested in rerecording it
01:48:25 But it would have to be with a different audience because I won't work with ben anymore
01:48:30 lemal, um
01:48:32 she
01:48:33 She she didn't she didn't mention the idea
01:48:36 You know
01:48:37 The idea of rerecording it had been floated before she had said she would not release the original
01:48:41 She wanted to record it, but I would really like to see her try to do it now
01:48:45 Because now you know she she doesn't even have like who would she do it in front of?
01:48:50 Yeg is gone. Yeg is split. You know
01:48:53 It's literally just her
01:48:55 and her boyfriend
01:48:57 living in her parents house
01:49:00 Just smoking weed with her mom and like getting a fucking allowance
01:49:04 for living just for living for free
01:49:07 and smoking weed 24 seven that's that's
01:49:11 I mean literally the audience would be like her boyfriend and her parents like that would be the audience
01:49:17 I mean I'd like to see it. I would like to see it even like
01:49:23 The idea of redoing it
01:49:25 Does she care to tell the story again? Even no, of course not. It's it's an asinine like deflection
01:49:30 It's it's it's just her trying to put off responsibility. It's like yeah
01:49:34 I trashed the lecture, but only because I want to rerecord it lol like oh, oh, oh, okay. Yeah
01:49:41 I mean just imagining her doing like travel all the way across the country
01:49:46 Imagining her doing that is so funny that I wish I wish it were true
01:49:51 I wish it were a thing that that would ever happen. No, I mean
01:49:55 Okay, humoring the idea that she would actually do it
01:49:58 She would do it just like the fucking the what were they called the little lectures that she did on the yeg channel
01:50:03 Which are like look like shit and they're filmed on a phone
01:50:08 That it would it would look like that and she would see no she would see no no problem with that
01:50:15 Um with that aspect of it anyway
01:50:18 Um, yeah, I don't know. I'm pretty mad about it, but you know what else is new
01:50:23 fruit fly
01:50:25 okay, um
01:50:27 Next voicemail. Yep
01:50:29 It's called janes three two one go
01:50:34 I think it's fine for teenagers to have internet world models like best guy ever
01:50:39 As they are growing up in the world and they need to have people to take reference from
01:50:43 besides their parents
01:50:45 But as they grow into young adults
01:50:47 They should recognize what faults their role models have and aspire to be better than them
01:50:53 As well as decide what positive impact they want to have on the world
01:50:58 I think I mean in general
01:51:02 I guess I agree in general. Sure
01:51:05 I think I think I mean, I think nate is a weird choice of role model, but whatever
01:51:10 Yeah, I don't know
01:51:14 I get that like
01:51:15 You you're young and you see videos and you don't realize whether they're good or not necessarily you just sort of like the what you like
01:51:24 And then when you grow older you should look
01:51:28 Maybe critically on your past
01:51:30 nostalgia stuff
01:51:31 Not all of it's gonna work
01:51:33 Not all of it's gonna be something that you're gonna carry forward for the rest of your life or
01:51:37 Is a good thing to base your life off of so I don't know
01:51:40 I guess so I guess that's
01:51:42 Fair
01:51:43 Yeah, fair. Yeah, sure. I don't I don't begrudge. I mean, I don't I don't
01:51:48 begrudge people
01:51:50 I mean
01:51:52 I mean, I'm I'm old and I still I mean, I still really like Sean
01:51:55 I still like I guess I kind of look up to him a little bit like I I think he's a
01:52:00 Smart guy who I would like like to emulate in some way
01:52:04 I mean not like he's not my role model or anything
01:52:07 But I really like his opinions and I appreciate him
01:52:10 So I guess I don't think it's it's not bad to like
01:52:14 Think someone's cool on the internet. I don't know
01:52:17 um
01:52:18 Sure. Yeah, whatever
01:52:21 Next voicemail is another it's another image. I will post it in the
01:52:27 We'll post it in the chat here for elisar
01:52:30 The virgin home buyer versus the chat bitcoin gambler
01:52:35 I think this has got to be a crack versus me. I think yes
01:52:40 Yeah
01:52:41 Virgin's great because it's it's the right way to do this thing where the chat is insane and not good
01:52:49 The chat is

01:53:55 Well, I mean
01:53:57 Yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe that's a
01:54:00 artifact from the original

01:55:09 um
01:55:10 coin
01:55:12 Next voicemail, okay
01:55:15 This is called hemlo corgo nine the huss
01:55:19 Uh, this is sent from ben saint pisses on him
01:55:22 him
01:55:23 Himmels in the bathtub at aol.com. I think
01:55:28 That hemlo corgo sent me a dm or saying
01:55:32 Please don't play my voicemail. I was really drunk when I made it
01:55:37 So now I want to know so in three two one go
01:55:42 Hey ben, um, just to start this off real quick. I would like to um clarify that my pronouns are she her
01:55:50 Because you have had any trouble
01:55:54 deciphering that fact
01:55:57 You know because you're super cringe and you're a boomer and you're old. I'm sorry. I do
01:56:02 I do assume mails by default sometimes
01:56:07 The series videos are way better than yours and they're also incredibly enjoyable to listen to
01:56:13 So I don't have a problem with sarah zed
01:56:17 Why do you think there's so much like more fun to listen to?
01:56:21 And why do you think for hussy so hard?
01:56:24 even though they have
01:56:27 like repeatedly committed
01:56:30 Extremely shady business practices in the past
01:56:35 I love hussy too. I love homestuck. I love psychologials, but okay you simp for the hus
01:56:43 Really really hard and it's pretty cringe
01:56:47 And I would just like what your justification for that
01:56:51 It's not it's not true. I deny the charges
01:56:58 I I don't simp
01:57:00 I I like hussy and I admire hussy as an artist. I have never I have never defended his business practices. I said
01:57:09 that
01:57:10 I do I do like I do appreciate hussy
01:57:13 More than sarah zed on the whole
01:57:15 I think hussy has done more for the world
01:57:18 But I mean that's a pretty broad claim
01:57:20 Um, I don't defend any of the like weird business shit that hussy is obviously
01:57:26 Hussy is a terrible business person who runs like a kind of a train wreck of a company
01:57:31 Like I think that's pretty established now and I don't think
01:57:36 I've literally settled. I've literally set I'm repeating myself, but just since you asked
01:57:41 Sarah's ed. I don't I don't begrudge her making any of those videos. I don't think she's wrong to do it even if
01:57:48 even if the attitude
01:57:50 Literally just the attitude in her thumbnail because I didn't even watch the video because I already know what she's gonna say
01:57:55 Uh, uh, even if the attitude in her thumbnail annoys me. I don't begrudge her that I don't have anything against her
01:58:01 Even if I'm not like super impressed with her
01:58:05 Right like she's fine. Um, I haven't watched her new shipping video. I might
01:58:12 I might watch I was I was annoyed. I was annoyed to see it trending on twitter
01:58:17 because it's like
01:58:19 It's just a youtube just a youtuber released a video and it's like trending news on twitter
01:58:24 I saw the shipping the the thumbnail. I was like the shipping wars. I'm like, okay
01:58:29 This can't be interesting. There's no way it's interesting
01:58:33 I don't it's a people people discussing people sort of video
01:58:38 Yeah, it's it's gonna be
01:58:41 I mean, I can take some guesses as to what happened
01:58:44 I
01:58:45 the okay
01:58:47 The like even like the definitions of the words pro shipper and anti shipper. I'm like not a hundred percent
01:58:53 I feel like sometimes I hear them called like
01:58:56 Like pro shippers are like pedophiles and like they're pro like pedo and like incest and rape stuff
01:59:03 and I
01:59:05 I think that's what the the distinction is
01:59:08 But I don't I don't know
01:59:10 I could be wrong. I could be totally off base there. So, I mean I can imagine it's
01:59:15 You know, I mean I'm I'm Minerva
01:59:19 What's her fucking handle
01:59:21 double cast
01:59:23 Made that video about uh, you know the fandom the harry potter troll lady who did the whole the fake accounts and the harry potter fan fiction
01:59:30 I mean, it's probably kind of like that, you know, like some factions agree on this thing some don't there's there's drama
01:59:36 There's people make there's probably false allegations
01:59:39 This drama constantly every so often I catch like some either it's like super smash brothers
01:59:45 Or like some artist who was abusive and it's like it's just hashtags and twitter threads
01:59:50 And it's like here's a thread about this person. I'm like
01:59:53 I never it's whatever it doesn't matter
01:59:57 I don't care. I will never care. I it could be interesting. I don't know. I might watch it eventually. I haven't watched it yet
02:00:03 Um, I don't know the point is to which these things are like big deals is never really that big
02:00:09 I feel if somebody became like a serial murderer and then I'd be like, holy shit. What the fuck
02:00:15 You play smash and then you go kill a hundred people. That's a bit. That's a bit of an interesting story
02:00:20 Hello, you say that I'm simping for hussey. I think you're simping for sarah zed here here because I never said that I had a problem with her
02:00:26 There's no reason to be upset and here you are
02:00:30 Here you are. You're upset that I
02:00:32 Am not that I am not like enthusiastically
02:00:36 like praising sarah, so I
02:00:39 Uh, I I like hussey. I admire hussey. I
02:00:44 admit
02:00:45 He is a man of many faults who has fallen short of the mark
02:00:50 many times, uh
02:00:52 and that's
02:00:54 I just you know, it is it is what it is. Okay. I think that's all I have to say about that
02:00:59 Um next voicemail is called tricksy was wrong three two one go
02:01:06 So a couple weeks ago you were talking about the criteria for a good lecture
02:01:11 um
02:01:11 Which I guess my understanding of it was something you might not check out otherwise
02:01:16 Or maybe it's not as successful or easy to get into but it has merits
02:01:20 And I it got me to think about like some of the other old
02:01:24 Ideas people had had for lectures that didn't come to pass
02:01:27 Uh, the biggest one for me would have been tricksy's
02:01:29 Uh, coheed and camry lecture and she would always bring up the fact that she didn't think it would be a good lecture
02:01:34 But I wholeheartedly disagree. I've really gotten into that fan as as of late and I like
02:01:42 It's great to listen to but it's not easy to get into there's a lot more going on behind the scenes
02:01:47 And it would make a really good lecture if someone really went in and broke that down
02:01:51 Um, I mean as someone who will never ever like
02:02:00 Listen to coheed and camry and delve into like the lore of like what their songs are about
02:02:06 I would say that that is like, yeah pretty good
02:02:11 Pretty if it if it's telling like a lore based story. Yeah, that's something that I would never check out for myself
02:02:18 But would maybe like explained to me by someone who did
02:02:22 So I guess I agree. It sounds like it could be a good lecture. Yeah
02:02:27 Um, next one is called tricksy was wrong clarification
02:02:31 three two one go
02:02:34 To clarify what I mean by a lot going on is that the quote-unquote story is across a bunch of mediums and and it isn't easy to experience
02:02:42 Yeah, that yeah, that's what I thought
02:02:45 That's what that was. I what I thought it was like
02:02:48 okay, um
02:02:50 Next one is called
02:02:52 It's a little emoji. It's like a little like one concerned eyebrow over the face
02:02:57 That's a colon and a backslash like a face
02:03:00 Looks kind of concerned
02:03:02 Looks kind of concerned maybe a little judgmental little sus there. Maybe yeah
02:03:08 Yeah on the on the brink of sus
02:03:10 If you have the other eyebrow raised then it would be sus
02:03:16 Three two one go
02:03:19 So I've stuck to what I said in the last voicemail I left
02:03:24 And I have avoided
02:03:26 listening to the new episode of the podcast this Friday as I'm recording this
02:03:31 And uh, I don't know you guys. I mean it could be a coincidence. This is only one data point
02:03:38 But it feels like best Friday. I've had in a few months or so. I don't know
02:03:43 um
02:03:45 Okay. Oh, I guess
02:03:46 You know, I mean I get Tommy j told me that he was a heel
02:03:51 All along and that it was all but now he's he's he's he's he's leaning into the heel bit. He's he's he's going full heel turn
02:04:00 Uh, how long?
02:04:02 How long will the I don't listen to the pcp anymore bit stay fresh? Uh, find out
02:04:10 I mean if it happens one more time this episode, I think it will have soured already
02:04:15 I think
02:04:17 I don't know if it can even last one more
02:04:20 ever
02:04:22 Uh, next one is called
02:04:25 Tony three two one go
02:04:30 I'm gonna be honest I've submitted like five of these voicemails already
02:04:34 But I never remember to check for future pcp episodes where mine might be on
02:04:40 And besides I close the podcast
02:04:44 Right at that part anyway, so it's not like I why do you send voicemails if you don't listen to the voicemail?
02:04:50 I will never hear your reaction to this
02:04:53 Why
02:04:56 It's just musing on the idea that that no, what do you know? I'm just throwing it to the wind
02:05:00 I just how interesting
02:05:03 I
02:05:05 It takes all kinds I guess
02:05:08 I mean, I don't I don't know
02:05:10 Um
02:05:11 Next one is called apologizing for one upping. Sorry. It's bad. Sorry. Apologizing
02:05:18 GUZ for one upping. Sorry. It's bad. She heard three two one go
02:05:25 I'm sorry. I I I swear. I'm not an edgy 14 year old. Okay
02:05:29 I I painted myself in the wrong light by bringing up the insufferable social media argument
02:05:34 You know, I was just trying to bridge the gap between where I I fell in, you know
02:05:38 I was an edgy 11 year old
02:05:40 You know from from what I could parse what I did understand. I was like hell. Yeah, this is funny
02:05:46 You know, all right. I I learned my lesson. All right as I never listened to the insufferable media podcast
02:05:52 So I have no opinion of monkey jones in real time. I have no opinion about not actually in real time
02:05:56 But as I listened throughout episodes, I watched him
02:05:59 Disappear and that that that that's made me start to realize, you know
02:06:03 As as monkey jones slowly faded as my role model
02:06:07 It it became you guys and you know, I guess just another thing I want to say
02:06:11 Is that effectively having listened to you for so long? Um, you guys are all basically like parental figures to me
02:06:17 And it's really weird. Uh, it sure is
02:06:20 Sure, it's weird. Sure. It's weird. Don't all right here as your
02:06:26 parental figure I must say
02:06:28 Don't listen to us. Don't do that. Don't look up to us. That's really stupid
02:06:33 uh
02:06:35 um
02:06:36 Yeah, I I would say
02:06:40 I don't want I don't want that kind of responsibility. Uh
02:06:44 You learn learn from my mistakes
02:06:46 And nothing else
02:06:49 Next one is called on kiwi farms ideology
02:06:52 three two one go
02:06:55 I recall correctly one of the things that was like downright said on kiwi farms was that they will misgender like
02:07:00 Trans lulcows and the lgbt members of kiwi farms will be fine with it
02:07:05 And also the guy who runs it is also a great replacement conspiracy not an anti-semitic. So yeah, they clearly have an ideology
02:07:13 whether they want to admit it or not
02:07:15 yeah, that's
02:07:17 That's the that's the attitude of like, you know, like all all the all the lgbt
02:07:24 and and lgbt q and and in particular trans people that have been
02:07:30 Raging at me because like
02:07:32 You shouldn't don't make
02:07:35 Don't make her one of us. Don't make Chris one of us. No. No, keep it away. Don't let it be one of me. No
02:07:44 um
02:07:46 It's it's yeah, it's that same like self-hating like gatekeeping
02:07:51 Pick me. I'm one of the good ones
02:07:53 shit that like is so typical of that kind of like
02:07:58 You know, I mean kiwi farms is a website
02:08:01 About bullying people
02:08:04 So of course you go there
02:08:06 You get bullied. You're you're you're an lgbt freak. You get bullied
02:08:11 They'll let you they'll let you stick around and they won't harass you
02:08:14 But only if you only if you like kowtow and put up with like the fact that like they think less of you
02:08:20 so
02:08:21 You know, of course, of course, that's the type of course. That's the type right like if you're like, I don't know
02:08:29 sort of like
02:08:30 Think of yourself the way that they think of you
02:08:33 And you're like, yeah, that they're right. They're right because I hate myself. They hate me. It just makes sense. You know
02:08:39 Yeah, yeah, stupid. Yeah, they man. They really they really fucking hate this like trans e celeb
02:08:45 They really fucking hate them and be and are and like they're they don't accept. They think they're faking. They think they're agp
02:08:52 Faker. Yeah, I agree too because because I'm not like that because I'm I'm different like I'm I'm one of the real ones
02:08:58 Right. I'm not faking like like whoever, right?
02:09:03 You know
02:09:05 What what more do I need to say it's sad
02:09:08 um
02:09:09 Yeah
02:09:10 Next one is for reference in regards to the natehead
02:09:14 three two one go
02:09:17 Okay, ben recognized my voice cool, uh for reference the whole thing to the angry natehead was actually death alchemist
02:09:23 Old thing that tom used to do back when he was right about to leave the pony days where right when he was talking about the episode
02:09:28 He would like give the good but then right when he would give his criticisms
02:09:31 He would like, you know, say exactly what I said on the podcast and it was just the
02:09:35 Just the funniest thing to me
02:09:38 Uh, I'm guessing you guys don't remember it, but it was something that definitely stuck with me just a dumb small thing
02:09:43 I don't I don't remember that at all
02:09:46 Do you remember what he's talking about? I think he's referring to the time where tom
02:09:52 did his
02:09:54 like
02:09:55 I'm leaving the fandom
02:09:57 Portion portion of a video like he was doing he was doing a brony analysis, whatever
02:10:04 And at the end he's like, well, you know what I don't like doing this and I'm not gonna do it anymore
02:10:09 And you know what you all suck. I can't remember how like inflammatory he was
02:10:13 I don't think he was actually like like a jesse level like fuck you
02:10:18 But he did sort of piss a lot of people off
02:10:21 And everyone was really really upset with him
02:10:24 And uh, that was funny. Yeah
02:10:27 is
02:10:28 So it was a reference to tom's
02:10:30 I'm leaving the the brony fandom
02:10:33 thing
02:10:34 I think so
02:10:35 I don't okay. I believe the video is gone because
02:10:38 cringe
02:10:39 I mean, it's not it's not cringe
02:10:42 No, that's history. Don't erase history
02:10:45 No
02:10:46 Bring it back. You know what I I I learned release release the tommy cut
02:10:50 What I learned realized years ago. Um
02:10:54 brony curious is like mr. Plinkett style review of some pony episode was gone
02:11:01 Oh, it was of of equestria girls
02:11:04 Yeah, it's gone the the plinkett brony curious. I wanted to rewatch it. It was it was actually good
02:11:11 You know what? Yeah
02:11:12 Me too. I have these I don't remember when it was it might have been like two years ago or something
02:11:18 But yeah, I also like I was going back to rewatch it just because
02:11:23 And it was and I couldn't I think I could find like the first episode somewhere
02:11:27 um
02:11:29 I'm not sure maybe it's on like a playlist. So it might just be unlisted, but I couldn't yeah, I couldn't find it
02:11:35 I I guess I could ask tongue just to see if if I if it's unlisted if I could have a link
02:11:40 But it's like I don't really care that much to rewatch it. I just don't like that. It's gone. You know, I don't like that
02:11:46 It's gone. I I don't understand
02:11:48 I I really don't understand the attitude of like
02:11:51 I like I like why like why get rid of it because it's because it's brony related like so what who cares
02:11:57 I don't know the whole channel is brony related
02:12:00 well
02:12:01 Not anymore, right? It's rebranded
02:12:04 Or wait, did he have did he
02:12:07 He made a different account for brony curious. He had a different different account
02:12:12 Called for rebel pixels, which was the tablet review and technology and like art thing
02:12:19 Yeah
02:12:20 And I I don't know whether that was the same channel as the brony curious channel
02:12:25 I can't remember. It's been a while. I I I think brony curious got rebranded
02:12:30 Into one of the channels
02:12:33 Yeah, I don't I don't understand why you would take that down. It was
02:12:37 I I
02:12:39 Can't I can't I have no idea. I have no idea why
02:12:43 um
02:12:44 Next one is called Ben's ooo
02:12:46 3 2 1 go
02:12:49 Ben sains
02:12:52 You cannot
02:12:56 Only

02:13:04 I'm super
02:13:08 I'm plus I'm somewhere in the plus probably
02:13:11 You do not attract a demisexual person as your partner
02:13:17 You will
02:13:19 You will attract a feline
02:13:22 And I know you do not want a feline
02:13:29 This person needs a glass of water
02:13:33 They need to stay hydrated
02:13:35 um
02:13:37 They need to stay hydro-weighted
02:13:39 I drew hydro-woo-weighted
02:13:44 Is this my water
02:13:46 Oh
02:13:53 I have many I have man of many man of many oos
02:13:57 um
02:13:58 Next one is Ben's ooo part two three more like part two ooo
02:14:05 Yeah, three two one go
02:14:08 So that's correction
02:14:11 You cannot

02:14:35 I'm gonna keep culturally appropriating. Oh, man. Oh, whoa. What's this sexual intercourse?
02:14:44 Notices bulge notices an entirely nude person. This reminds me of
02:14:50 There was a guy I looked at the the the the the Trixie thread on kiwi for speaking of kiwi farms
02:14:55 I looked at the thread like yesterday the day before and someone there's one guy on there who would make
02:15:03 He would occasionally post and his thing was that he was mad at her for rapping
02:15:08 while being white
02:15:10 And it was like really funny because his his stance was basically
02:15:15 So racist
02:15:17 That he basically circled around to being woke again
02:15:20 Like he he hates black culture so much
02:15:23 That he protects it that he wants to protect it from white people that want to like co-opt it because he doesn't want it to spread
02:15:31 Like that's his thing
02:15:34 And he even the even the other kiwi farmers like hate him and made fun of him for it
02:15:41 Is it even woke to like
02:15:44 to
02:15:45 Like gate keep culture
02:15:48 Yeah, it's it's I guess what you might
02:15:50 Call like a like a parody of being woke. It's like, oh, no no culturally appropriation
02:15:56 You can't do anything if you're you can't do these things if you're white
02:16:01 Or whatever
02:16:03 Oh, did you
02:16:04 Was it this week? Was it this week that uh fucking that fucking
02:16:10 Dumpling a noodle book
02:16:11 Thing happened on twitter. Did you see that? That was a little while ago
02:16:16 Was it um that was so
02:16:18 That was so annoying. I saw
02:16:21 If you don't know it was oh, yeah
02:16:23 I know I the there was the like the rebuttal that looked into the author
02:16:28 And it turns out the lady who was white who made the book about noodles
02:16:34 Grew up with asian people and culture
02:16:37 Yeah, she was like and so yeah, so it's like fine and not even I mean it I mean it would have been fine anyway
02:16:44 Yeah, it's like their argument
02:16:46 Yeah, it's just like completely destroyed in every way audience if you don't know the context is this this woman this this I think she was a
02:16:53 filipina
02:16:54 woman
02:16:55 Made a calm she made a tweet that was like
02:16:58 Why did a white woman write a book about noodles and dumplings and it was it showed like the book
02:17:04 Which is it's called like dumplings and noodles and it was the author and she's like white and she has like curly red hair
02:17:10 She looked like maybe
02:17:11 irish or something. I don't know
02:17:13 um, but uh
02:17:15 yeah, so like
02:17:17 I don't know this kind of shit like like
02:17:20 I saw I saw a a guy
02:17:24 I don't know his name, but I see him on my timeline. I don't think I follow him. He's like a he's like a male only fans
02:17:30 Model he's like a male like porn guy
02:17:33 But he's like this buff. I think he's middle eastern and he
02:17:39 Is like a handsome
02:17:41 fucking
02:17:42 Guy who gay does gay only fans porn, but he also like
02:17:47 Wait, wait, wait, wait
02:17:49 No, it's not gay chat
02:17:51 He's not middle eastern
02:17:53 Um, I don't think um, but this this he also just makes like good like socialist posts
02:17:58 He just like he just has good politics and posts about them sometimes and he posted and he was like
02:18:05 He said like it's only it's only deaspora kids meaning like
02:18:09 Kids that were born away from their home like like people that are actually from these places don't care
02:18:15 He was like it's only deaspora kids that like give a shit about this kind of
02:18:20 Cultural appropriation like he said my my parents find it funny. They find it amusing when like americans like make
02:18:28 Uh persian food. I think maybe he's persian or something
02:18:31 And I and I think that's true
02:18:33 Uh, it's it sounds true to me. I don't know this is a sentiment that I've seen echoed by other
02:18:38 Like people that are actually from like a foreign country when they see like a white person like
02:18:44 Doing a tea ceremony or making some food. They're like ha ha lol cute or whatever there. I don't know this this lady
02:18:53 I don't know she she she had this like stupid
02:18:57 She had this stupid take and then she complained about it for like she had like a huge meltdown on twitter about it for like
02:19:04 Days because people were calling it stupid. She you know said like oh, I've been spending my I've been all these days
02:19:10 I've been getting harassed by nazis which
02:19:13 Probably some yeah, probably some nazis were in there jumping on this to be racist
02:19:19 And then at the end of it all she's like boy. I've been through so much. Here's my cash app fucking
02:19:26 Tip me and like I'm sure she made like a ton of money
02:19:29 I don't because she was the main character of twitter for like two days there
02:19:33 Uh, so I had another whole thing's obnoxious the whole the whole story is annoying and I don't like it
02:19:39 Uh, and I don't like that kind of like why a white a white person making noodles like
02:19:48 Ah
02:19:52 Okay, I think I've made my point
02:19:54 um
02:19:55 Next voicemail is called one cool dud three two one go
02:20:01 Officially induct cyber shell already that bitch is fucking delightful
02:20:09 Cyber shell is delightful. Yes
02:20:12 Uh, but no ceremonies
02:20:15 Yeah, we ran out of confetti. We don't have anymore. We can't do it
02:20:20 Yeah, yeah, and and like the the dubbing the the the the new member dubbing sword is like it's rusty needs repairing
02:20:30 Yeah, it's um, it needs to be reforged in the fires of mount doom
02:20:35 And it's really far away. It's in like new zealand. It's like there's covids. It's kind of hard to get over to there right now. Yeah
02:20:41 Yeah, yeah, it's actually fro could just take a plane
02:20:46 Why didn't the ball rod just fly the ring to mortar with its wings?
02:20:53 Why didn't Frodo just fucking throw it? Do you know do you know about the ball do ball rocks have wings debate?
02:21:00 um, I
02:21:01 No, I have no idea about that. Well, the the ball rock is described in the book
02:21:06 I I knew about this already, but dan olson just put out a video that is about um
02:21:11 Like an an older adaptation of the lord of the rings not the peter jackson one and he he mentioned this so it's fresh in my mind, but there is a
02:21:18 um
02:21:20 The the ball rock is it's described first as having
02:21:25 Like darkness spreading out around it like wings
02:21:28 And then later on it says
02:21:31 That it's it says like it's wings spread
02:21:33 So it kind of like first implies that it doesn't have wings
02:21:37 But just has like shadows that cast a shadow that looks like wings
02:21:41 But then later on it does refer to the wings
02:21:44 and there's
02:21:46 a great debate
02:21:47 In scholarship and I've seen I've seen really compelling arguments on both sides
02:21:52 Of like why like the ball rock definitely does have wings or definitely doesn't have wings
02:21:57 The I watched a video where like a Tolkien expert some professor somewhere
02:22:02 Says that they they definitely don't have wings
02:22:05 Because they are creations of morgoth
02:22:09 And morgoth would not like he made he made the ball rocks to be
02:22:14 What they are like deliberately he crafted them
02:22:17 So why would he give them vestigial wings that don't work that would be like
02:22:21 A waste but then I saw and this was again. This was Sean my guy
02:22:26 He made it he tweeted but he says
02:22:28 That he thinks they do have wings
02:22:30 They can't he that they can't fly but that they do have wings
02:22:34 Because morgoth was he made
02:22:37 He made all kinds of creatures. He was he was doing all kinds of like experiments and making creatures
02:22:42 So it's it's totally it is reasonable to think that you know
02:22:45 Not every creature that he made came out exactly like on purpose
02:22:50 Maybe some of them came out a little weird and and that's like why not?
02:22:54 Um
02:22:55 So like or morgoth's not all powerful
02:22:58 So, I don't know. I think maybe he had a red bull. Haha
02:23:04 Although I do think
02:23:07 I do think that the image of a ball rock having not actual wings, but just like
02:23:13 Perpetually casting a wing like shadows around itself. I think that's cooler. Honestly
02:23:19 Um, it isn't the ball rock like in moria
02:23:23 Like trapped down there
02:23:26 Um, like it was released. I don't know
02:23:29 But like it's not supposed to be there normally
02:23:32 They the dwarves unearthed it by digging too deep. I think so. All right. Does he like being in the ground?
02:23:40 Because if why would why would he fly why would he fly and why that's what I want to know
02:23:45 Would he fly up to the surface and go see the birds?
02:23:50 You know, I I think I think that the ball rock was not
02:23:54 Oh god, I don't fucking know what I'm talking about. I could be wrong
02:23:57 But I don't I think he was originally trapped down in the earth
02:24:00 I don't think he was like meant to be down there
02:24:02 He was trapped down there and then the dwarves unearthed him by digging
02:24:08 I think
02:24:10 And then he got him
02:24:12 And then oh he oh he got
02:24:14 Oh, he got him real good and then unrelated a bunch of
02:24:18 goblins and orcs
02:24:20 took over
02:24:21 because of
02:24:22 Sauron or something
02:24:24 Yes, I think
02:24:27 So
02:24:30 Yeah
02:24:32 Anyway, uh cyber shell is cool. Cyber shell can be on
02:24:36 whenever
02:24:38 He doesn't he doesn't have to be we don't have to yeah
02:24:40 We don't have to throw a fucking party and do the whole thing we did with like Jeff and monkey about like, oh, you're an official member now
02:24:47 Yeah, there's no there's no need for such
02:24:50 There's no reason for that. They can just I mean like fit mc is on a bunch of episodes. Should we
02:24:55 induct him like I don't know
02:24:57 They can just come on the show. They just be on the show and they'll be it'll be cool
02:25:02 True
02:25:03 Next one is is son of meroac three two one go
02:25:08 At Otacon there is an art show that takes place in the artist alley where artists can submit unique pieces of art
02:25:16 and
02:25:17 People can sign up to bid for them on an online auction
02:25:22 So I will submit 20 to 40 pieces of unique
02:25:27 hentai
02:25:29 that people can sign up
02:25:31 And wait, this is the same voicemail as last week potentially if there are enough
02:25:37 Online bids it can actually go to a live auction also
02:25:42 So
02:25:43 That's I feel like son of meroac sent this exact same. I wasn't clear so there you go
02:25:49 No
02:25:50 but why
02:25:52 But why
02:25:53 It's it's an auction and like people buy it, but like
02:25:57 Do you son of meroac draw all the hentai or do you just what have it?
02:26:03 Like why who are you to profit off of hentai you collect? I don't get it
02:26:08 What is the what is the point? I don't you put artists put art into a
02:26:13 Thing and it gets auctioned and then I guess the artist gets paid. I don't know all all I'm all I'm getting is that there is an auction
02:26:20 I son of meroac am submitting pieces into it to be auction
02:26:27 What what am I supposed to latch on to here?
02:26:31 Uh, good luck. I guess you're supposed to park ben
02:26:35 Pog okay
02:26:37 Next one is called optimal homestuck three two one go
02:26:42 Optimal homestuck experience step one start homestuck step two get sidetracked by problem sleuth step three never look back
02:26:52 problem sleuth is
02:26:55 objectively a better story than homestuck
02:26:59 It's it's more nicely connected together. Yeah
02:27:03 Yeah, it
02:27:04 Yeah
02:27:06 Man, it gave me false hope. It gave me false hope problem sleuth's ending is so good and so robustly
02:27:14 Interconnected that it gave me false hope. I made me think like
02:27:18 Well, obviously hussy knows what he's doing
02:27:21 Just look at the ending of homestuck or the ending of problem sleuth like
02:27:25 Homestuck is just that it's just that but like bigger and more elaborate
02:27:28 So like just like in problem sleuth the ending of homestuck it will all come together and it will all tie together into a into a perfect
02:27:34 It's package and it was just false
02:27:39 It's the metaphor I would use is that the the the it's the same thing
02:27:44 But due to its size
02:27:47 It can't it can't like like hold its own weight under gravity
02:27:52 It's just too big and so it collapsed. I thought
02:27:56 I I just I thought like
02:27:59 Hussy knows what he's doing. He wouldn't he wouldn't have built the story like this if he couldn't make it all come work in the ends
02:28:09 Yeah, it's
02:28:11 I mean, I don't I don't want to get into a whole thing about like what was wrong with the ending of homestuck, but
02:28:17 Problem sleuth is but I mean I would still say finish it
02:28:21 At least at least finish act five
02:28:24 At least get to risk it and then understand who I am or
02:28:29 Yeah, true
02:28:31 Next one is called. Why is no one talking about this three two one go
02:28:36 What's up everybody? It's pretty cool. Today. We're going to be looking at one of the worst shit stands to ever grace the internet
02:28:42 His name has been saint. He's a comic artist podcaster and ran a tier fake professor
02:28:47 This man is single-handedly responsible for all the horrible news surrounding chris chain
02:28:52 You don't know chris chain was recently arrested for raping his elderly mother an action that was directly influenced by slime
02:29:03 In this in this tweet thread, I will one out of
02:29:08 It's it's it's cleverly disguised, but it's it doesn't sound like a human
02:29:12 It's this the robot
02:29:14 one of the
02:29:17 one of the many
02:29:19 arrangements that I observe in the like
02:29:22 In like the the the in the the kiwi farms freaks that are like
02:29:28 In my in my men. She's lately
02:29:30 Is is this idea that they they they on the one hand they must
02:29:36 They must persecute chris in any way possible whether that's misgendering her
02:29:41 You know calling calling her, you know a rapist, which you know fair enough
02:29:46 Calling her, you know retarded or whatever
02:29:49 Whatever they want to do they must persecute chris to the maximum extent in every possible way
02:29:54 But also
02:29:56 But also they must implicate me
02:29:59 In her crimes and like claim that I am they must guilt me by saying like ben
02:30:05 you're wrong
02:30:07 because
02:30:08 You did this like you
02:30:11 talked to chris
02:30:12 You what they say is you encouraged her delusions. You drove her further and further into her delusions by by acknowledging them
02:30:20 And and therefore the fact that this happened. This is partly your fault
02:30:25 It's like you could have stopped this ben if you had just said wait a minute chris
02:30:29 Actually, I don't think the cartoon world and the real world are going to merge in a big like roger rabbit fucking
02:30:36 Cosmic calamity actually
02:30:38 I don't think that would have if if you had just said that she would have snapped out of her thing
02:30:42 And she would have been like wow, I guess I should I should get a job or something
02:30:46 You could you you helped cause this ben because you didn't do it. I was there. I
02:30:53 Kiwi farms fucking self-hating troll whatever I was there in the menschies every time chris tweeted
02:30:59 I said chris you are you need a job. You are delusional
02:31:03 You are not a woman. You are a man and you're retarded
02:31:06 I was there every single time doing my duty
02:31:09 And if only you ben had joined me in that crusade that all it would have been enough
02:31:13 It would have tipped the scales and everything would have turned out differently, but no you wouldn't you said I want this mom reaped to occur
02:31:22 You premeditated it 10 years ago. You premeditated it all ben
02:31:27 um
02:31:28 Yeah, they they I mean, where's the lie?
02:31:31 Where is the lie? I don't
02:31:34 That's that's just
02:31:36 Yeah, it's it's pretty it's pretty fucked. It's pretty fucked up when when they when they pull that card like I

02:34:04 Hey, I'm really sorry about that little voicemail. I said a lot of racial slurs
02:34:10 Like probably every single one made up a few new ones for eastern europeans. Really don't like those guys
02:34:17 um made fun of chinese people
02:34:19 Then I bent the knee to chinese people and said uh, hong kong and taiwan are countries
02:34:24 Um, I said ben's current address live on it and then I said the address he's going to be moving to next
02:34:31 Um, just so much bad shit. I'm really sorry. Please don't play that
02:34:39 And
02:34:41 If you if there was an email attached never play one from that email again, I'm very sorry
02:34:48 Hey, what voicemail am I right? Hmm. Don't know what voicemail you could possibly be referring to
02:34:57 Wink, what is this? Please don't play the last voicemail at cocksack.com
02:35:03 Well, I'll I'll be on the lookout for that one. We will be we will keep our eyes wide open
02:35:09 Next voicemail is called boy zerk
02:35:12 three two one go
02:35:15 I won't take this slander any longer the golden age arc of berserk is great
02:35:19 But it's the least good part of berserk the least everything after it is way better
02:35:23 The least people saying that only the golden age arc is worth reading or that you can just stop after that
02:35:29 Nah, it's all way better
02:35:31 Wow
02:35:33 Least good is quite a claim. I don't know if I would say
02:35:36 I think it's really good
02:35:39 that in in that it's
02:35:42 Like a contained story that could be stopped
02:35:46 Um, but I definitely think there's so much more good stuff later
02:35:51 Hey
02:35:52 The kushan the kushan empire arc with the the big crazy guy that turns into a thing
02:35:59 I feel like that's like the highest point of of the the manga
02:36:04 And even even just even just like
02:36:07 Griffith
02:36:08 In the hand and the the tower of I don't know religious guys
02:36:13 There's so many good parts. There's no bad part of berserk
02:36:18 But I can I can see the argument for that being like the least good because it's the most
02:36:23 I don't know
02:36:24 It's it's like a setup to something
02:36:28 That can be enjoyed by itself
02:36:31 Hmm
02:36:32 Um, I mean I never I read the I read golden age and then I read like a little bit afterwards
02:36:36 I read a bunch. There was like some fairies. I read like some stuff about fairies, uh, and that
02:36:43 That's why I didn't get much girl
02:36:46 Probably it was a long time ago
02:36:49 Uh, yeah, it was a girl with like really got to read at least at least up to the point where like the party forms
02:36:57 Yeah
02:36:59 You got to learn you got to know the characters before you can say
02:37:04 Yeah, you're right. I don't I don't know if I've if I've ever said like
02:37:09 I
02:37:11 I recommend okay, I recommended
02:37:14 People just read the golden age arc and then decide if you want to keep reading
02:37:19 I didn't say you don't have to keep reading. I said
02:37:23 Because that's the part I've read and I said people should read that
02:37:26 And then if they like it they can continue. I did like it, but for some reason I bounced off it
02:37:30 And then I never got much further past it
02:37:33 Uh, I yeah, I can't
02:37:35 I never I never got kept going so I can't have any uh
02:37:39 Real opinion about whether it gets better or worse or or what?
02:37:43 um
02:37:43 Next one is called peri aka at lex paradox
02:37:49 Okay, three two one go
02:37:52 So I just got done arguing with stupid transfers about christian's gender on twitter on behalf of one benjamin saint
02:37:58 And I just wanted to get about how fucking awful they are
02:38:01 Like the entire crux of their argument rolls around christian saying one time that she wanted to be trans to fuck girls or something
02:38:07 10 years ago respond that the reason for someone changing their identity doesn't fucking matter
02:38:11 All that matters is that they identify as that gender
02:38:14 Then they abandon that first argument and pivot to essentially the argument that christ is too crazy to be trans which is
02:38:21 Concerning in and of itself and then you say well people believe in a lot of crazy shit
02:38:26 Does that discredit everything else that they believe about their identity and everything they think?
02:38:30 Then they know that they've lost and they just call you a bigot and act like they have the high ground or something
02:38:34 And they just run away and it's fucking stupid and it makes me happy dunking on these fucking idiots
02:38:39 Anyway, uh, then I just wanted to thank you for standing up for trans people. I really appreciate it
02:38:44 I've been listening to the podcast since I was since I was the since I was a freshman in high school
02:38:49 And i'm a junior in college now
02:38:51 U3 assuming tom is on today
02:38:53 I've always been my favorite members of the podcast and it's almost exclusively gotten better since everyone has gone
02:38:57 Even though everyone seems to think otherwise
02:39:00 Uh, not everyone and have good wonderful days. I love all of you also follow me on twitter
02:39:05 Sometimes I make art when i'm not dunking on idiots. Goodbye at
02:39:11 at lex lexis lex s p e r i d o t i assume that's twitter handle
02:39:18 Well, i'm glad you appreciate me or me getting in fights on twitter. Uh, I I remember
02:39:24 Yeah, they the what you said is exactly right
02:39:27 They they will they will yeah, they will they will make a claim
02:39:31 They will make a claim
02:39:33 like, um
02:39:35 Chris said she's Chris said she's faking
02:39:38 And then when you go that was 10 years ago and also and also it's irrelevant that she said that one time
02:39:43 Then they will pivot to Chris is too crazy and doesn't get to decide her own gender. She can't make that claim
02:39:49 She she says other crazy things. We shouldn't believe her and then you go
02:39:53 That doesn't make any sense because that's what being trans is she identifies as trans
02:39:57 That's the end and then they and then they will they will just they will just pivot to a new
02:40:00 They'll just keep pivoting to a new argument every single time
02:40:03 And then they will just circle back around to the beginning
02:40:06 And just make the first argument again and just say that like you didn't and you know that you didn't you didn't respond to it
02:40:12 even when you did
02:40:15 And the the most annoying part of all that is that if you do like hound them to make them
02:40:21 Acknowledge that they have no argument to this, you know the the main point or something
02:40:25 They'll start saying why do you care so much? Why are you going on about this? You know, you kind of fucked up
02:40:30 They'll that's why that you having the argument is you being insane
02:40:35 Yeah, oh and that somehow that like discredits you it's like
02:40:40 That that one that one that one particularly angry one yesterday was like
02:40:46 convinced that like
02:40:48 me that like
02:40:50 That she said that true scum is a slur and that like by calling her a true scum. I am like
02:40:57 outing myself as a bigot because like true scum are the real
02:41:01 True scum aren't the bigots
02:41:03 The real bigots are the people that
02:41:05 hate true scum that don't agree with them and like
02:41:09 What do you even what do you even say to a person like that?
02:41:12 What do you even say?
02:41:15 I don't know. Yeah, the the the pivoting you say the pivoting fucked
02:41:20 The pivoting this is a thing. I've been complaining about this in my discord lot the the motton bailey argument where you
02:41:27 Make you advance two arguments simultaneously
02:41:31 one of which is
02:41:33 One of which is uh is controversial or hard to defend
02:41:36 And the other of which is basic and easy to defend you advance them together
02:41:42 Or as one argument or you advance an argument that could be read as one or the other
02:41:47 And then if someone argues against
02:41:49 the more difficult to defend argument that you made the more um
02:41:54 Yeah, the the more uh
02:41:57 Controversial argument you pretend you retreat from the bailey to the mott or is it from the mott to the bailey?
02:42:03 Whatever and you you retreat and you pretend that you were only advancing the the the basic uncontroversial one
02:42:11 Um, this is a I hate I hate this shit
02:42:14 It's so fuck I see it all the time and it's really transparent. It's just really it's really dishonest
02:42:20 It's it's you know
02:42:21 It's really the mark of a person who has a lot of faith that what they're saying is right and that like their ideology makes sense
02:42:29 Where in like they argue it in a way where like they have to pretend they're not arguing what they actually are trying to argue
02:42:36 It really speaks volumes to their character
02:42:39 um
02:42:40 Next voicemail is oh, it's another one from 4 20 69. Oh my god his mission
02:42:46 His mission updates, uh three two one from cabal from cabal cabal masi cabal
02:42:56 This is snake the natefuckers have captured me
02:43:00 I need help president biden isn't going to rescue me
02:43:03 I've tread calling sarah from kingdom arts by the phone ran out of battery in the desert
02:43:09 Don't let it end like this nate heads. I need your help
02:43:12 Press X on your controller to send me an airstrike
02:43:16 Press X for freedom press X for victory press X for sex
02:43:30 What's the mission again wait the fuck the fuck nate
02:43:34 The well the natefuckers captured him so I guess he's against the natefuckers. Oh, oh, he's it. Oh the nate heads
02:43:41 The ongoing war between the nate heads and the natefuckers
02:43:46 They're more like they're more alike than they know for no admit
02:43:51 yeah
02:43:52 they
02:43:55 Well, uh, I'm trying to think of a way to say the joke that I have
02:44:00 because like tally band
02:44:03 natefuckers nate heads
02:44:05 nate 11
02:44:07 Uh, it doesn't don't really work. That was al-qaeda that did the 9 11 not the tally band
02:44:15 No, no, I mean like like like tally band like uh had al-qaeda like tucked inside like sneakily
02:44:23 Like that was the whole reason
02:44:26 tally band like looked the other way
02:44:28 Didn't they? Oh, is that right?
02:44:31 And then they allowed al-qaeda to plan the 9 11 they did the 9 11
02:44:36 that
02:44:37 I and that's why they tell you that makes sense
02:44:40 That's why tally bad
02:44:42 Um, okay, I I'll I believe you that sounds plausible
02:44:47 um
02:44:49 Semper fidelis to all are some semper fidelis to the natefuckers. I'm
02:44:54 honestly

02:45:26 Uh, what if you go to go huff in
02:45:28 If you if you do not explicitly
02:45:31 What about just the tip natefuckers if you do not explicitly support the natefuckers you are
02:45:37 Taking a stance that you want nate to stay unfucked
02:45:41 and that is
02:45:43 Fucking disgusting
02:45:50 Nothing can be more I par
02:45:54 Nate Nate
