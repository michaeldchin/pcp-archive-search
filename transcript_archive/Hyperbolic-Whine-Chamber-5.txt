00:00:00 Hello there and welcome to another episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber where I train
00:00:08 my ability to complain. I am Tom Oliver and today we are drinking Citizen Cider Unified
00:00:16 Press Traditional Semi-Sweet Apple Cider. This is made locally in Vermont which is pretty
00:00:24 close to where I am here in MassachusettsCitizenCider.com. It's pretty good. I've had a few cans
00:00:31 of it so far. I'm a big fan of hard cider in general. The reason I bought this actually
00:00:38 wasn't because I was in the mood for cider or anything. It was because the graphic design
00:00:43 on the can is really nice. Really good type setting. Yeah, that's what happens when you
00:00:50 go to school for graphic design kids. That's where your purchase influences come from. Good
00:00:55 typography gets you a purchase from me. So yeah, not too sweet, just enough tart to be
00:01:03 pleasant. Good interaction with the palate. I like it. I like it a lot. CitizenCider.com.
00:01:14 If you would like to donate to the Wine Fund and suggest a wine to drink on the show, as
00:01:19 well as a topic to bitch about on the wine chamber, there's a link in the description
00:01:23 to my paypal. I'll also link to my coffee, which is a new thing I have now. So if you
00:01:27 want to buy me a coffee, buy me a drink, you can do that as well. They both have a note
00:01:31 feature so you can drop in what I should look for and what I should talk about. Now, before
00:01:37 we go any further, I wanted to make a quick mention because someone a couple months ago
00:01:41 sent me a wine suggestion and a topic suggestion and I'm not doing them right now. The reason
00:01:46 for that is I don't know if the payment got declined or it was cancelled or something,
00:01:52 it's weird. So I'm not going to use any names, but the guy said to get some passion
00:01:57 pump and if not, just get some box wine and wanted to complain about Windows updates,
00:02:01 which actually I could say a lot about because I had a bunch of problems with Windows updates,
00:02:05 but the status is money received cancelled. So I don't know if it never went through,
00:02:11 the payment never went through or like paypal did something or it's just like you've taken
00:02:14 like 3 months to get to my wine chamber topic, I'm taking my money back, totally understandable,
00:02:18 but just wanted to throw that out there. You know who you are if you're listening to this.
00:02:22 There was a weird issue with that and that's why I haven't gotten the passion pop. Also
00:02:28 the joke of the show is that it's called the wine chamber and I drink everything but wine.
00:02:32 So I'm more than willing to sell myself out and kill the joke entirely for money, but
00:02:38 I'm just letting you know that that's kind of the gist of the show is that it's a play
00:02:42 on words with wine because I'm whining while drinking not wine. There you go. I've explained
00:02:47 the joke, it's no longer a joke, so I guess I can do whatever I want now. But today on
00:02:52 the wine chamber, we're drinking Citizen Cider and we're talking about, I really didn't have
00:02:58 a good way of phrasing this like snappy, maybe I've come up with something better by the
00:03:01 time this goes up and I have a title for this episode, but for now it's going to be diametrically
00:03:06 opposed advice that is convincing on both sides. So I don't know a snappy way to put
00:03:15 that yet, I'm going to workshop it a bit between now and when this gets posted. But the idea
00:03:19 basically is that when we're growing up, we learn things and usually as we grow up, we
00:03:29 kind of internalize the building blocks of like how to actually function in society and
00:03:33 be a semi competent human being and kind of build the baseline skills you need to be actually
00:03:38 functional. There's usually a pretty straightforward path on how to do that. You know, and if
00:03:43 someone tries to deviate you from the path, once you have some general context, it's pretty
00:03:48 self evident that deviating from the path is a bad idea. Let's say you're a little kid
00:03:53 and your parents tell you, don't touch the stove, it'll burn you. I'm not going to touch
00:03:58 the stove. If someone then comes along and says, Hey, touch the stove, it builds character.
00:04:03 Not a very convincing argument. You really don't want to scald your hands. You're going
00:04:06 to be like, No, I'm good on that, dude. Not going to touch the stove. And if you do, you're
00:04:11 going to learn pretty quickly that advice kind of sucked. Like the character doesn't help
00:04:14 your hand heal over the next like two or three weeks. Simple example, but you get the general
00:04:18 idea. There's like a very linear sort of singular progression to building the basic building
00:04:26 blocks you need in order to be a functional human being. But at some point around adolescence,
00:04:30 things start to get kind of convoluted. Multiple paths open up, you can spec into different
00:04:35 options as you were. If you want to get some lead gamer terms in here, right, you can go
00:04:40 in different directions. And that's where things start to get a little bit murky. You
00:04:43 get to specialize, you know, your hobbies, your education, your, your dreams and ambitions
00:04:48 in life. There's tons of different options. I think it gets even worse though, when you're
00:04:53 done with education, because when you're when you're educating yourself and you're going
00:04:56 through the high school system, the college system, the trades school, anything like that,
00:05:00 there is an underlying structure, right? That's why you're paying money, you're putting the
00:05:03 time and that's why the accreditation you earn has merit because there is some sort
00:05:07 of underlying structure that you're working within and the people outside judging you based
00:05:11 on your your acquisition of your diploma or scale or whatever, they know that you were
00:05:15 able to function within the boundaries of those constraints and perform accordingly.
00:05:21 That's kind of where the value of a degree or whatever comes from. But when you try and
00:05:25 decide your life after that when you try and make more abstract decisions, lots of people
00:05:30 offer tons of conflicting advice that all seem basically as good and as relevant as
00:05:36 the next one and they all make compelling arguments. And now it's up to you, someone who has been
00:05:40 on a single trajectory, for the most part, a very structured way of learning a very structured
00:05:45 way of progressing your life and acquiring new skills to discern with no kind of guidance
00:05:53 whatsoever on how the best way is to operate your life. And perhaps this is just me as
00:05:58 someone who is like cursed with analysis paralysis constantly overthinking everything. But the
00:06:03 more I try and learn about how I should function as a human being and how I want to function
00:06:08 as a human being the skills I want to acquire the ways I want to live my life the values
00:06:12 I want to uphold. There are tons of conflicting information out there. And none of them seem
00:06:18 less compelling than the next they all make good cases. And it's up to me to try and figure
00:06:23 out which way I want to go and the only way to really kind of come to a proper conclusion
00:06:28 it seems is trial and error. And that's a pain in the ass. Let me give you an example.
00:06:32 This is probably the most relevant example to me personally in my life that continually
00:06:36 comes up in some way or another because it's a broad subject that can be attacked from different
00:06:40 angles but it really boils down to the same thing. Ambition versus complacency. And that
00:06:46 sounds much more derogatory really when I say it that way than what I mean. To kind
00:06:50 of delve into it a bit more. I am the kind of person that reads self help books. I know
00:06:56 it's kind of sad but that's just kind of where I am in my life and I like reading books
00:07:01 and like listening to audiobooks and that stuff mostly because I have an audible account
00:07:05 and I can't stand listening to fiction in audiobooks. But also because there's a lot
00:07:09 of interesting people. Usually what happens is I'll find someone on YouTube just kind
00:07:14 of browsing YouTube and I get a suggestion and I like find a person who seems really
00:07:18 interesting as a speaker like Gary Vaynerchuk is a good example. And so I read his book
00:07:22 and I bought his book and I'm like oh this is cool. So that's kind of how I find a lot
00:07:25 of these audiobooks that I end up purchasing because I have like these tokens every month
00:07:28 and I'm like what the fuck else am I going to do with it. I'm not going to listen to
00:07:30 Lord of the Rings and have some weird British guy try and voice you know every character.
00:07:35 But I digress. The self help books kind of there's two different schools. There's kind
00:07:40 of like the western business self help of like pulling you up yourself up by your bootstraps
00:07:46 and like attacking everything head on create big goals always be striving to grow more
00:07:50 more more be the biggest best you can be figure out what your goal is and then make it a hundred
00:07:56 times bigger and go for that. There's that one aspect of like constant self improvement
00:08:01 constant growth and constant just like expanding of your abilities and never being satisfied
00:08:06 with where you are. And then on the other hand you have the minimalist kind of Zen I don't
00:08:11 want to say Eastern but I kind of like the Buddhist kind of more like calm Zen mentality
00:08:17 of just like you know get your shit sorted. Understand that nothing is as important as
00:08:23 it's all being told to you to be and kind of try and find some inner tranquility imbalance
00:08:30 carve out a small little niche for yourself. Master that and then learn to be complacent
00:08:37 and maybe I'm complacent but satisfied. It's really being hungry for more versus being
00:08:43 grateful for what you already have and both sides of this equation make really good arguments
00:08:50 right because on the one hand this kind of like growth mentality is avoiding stagnation
00:08:56 and it's about not letting any of your potential go to waste. It's realizing that the human
00:09:00 potential in everybody is massive and you just have to learn to tap into it and be comfortable
00:09:05 going to places you haven't been before being vulnerable and weak and unskilled and powering
00:09:11 through that to reach new heights. And I guess as someone who's entrepreneurially minded
00:09:16 and why I'm doing all the YouTube stuff like I want to tap into that more because I feel
00:09:20 like that's definitely something that's holding me back from getting to a Digibro level of
00:09:23 a success is like really focusing like picking one skill and hammering away that hardcore
00:09:29 over and over and over again and not accepting anything less than the best that I can do
00:09:32 and beyond that and really planning huge and going far beyond anything I've never attempted
00:09:38 to do before and really push hard on that. But on the other hand you know the gratitude
00:09:45 mentality would say that that mentality is dangerous because you're never satisfied.
00:09:51 Even when you accomplish your goals it's short lived and you're just going to keep chasing
00:09:54 the next high for the rest of your life and you'll be chasing these empty accomplishments
00:09:58 where if you come at it from an angle of gratitude you can be thankful for what you have. And when
00:10:04 you grow it's always on top of a stable base like the growth isn't to give your life meaning
00:10:12 it's just something on top of meaning you've already derived from something internal. But
00:10:17 the downside to that is that you're limiting your potential because you're not working
00:10:21 as hard you might have more inner peace you might have more like mental tranquility but
00:10:27 you're inevitably not going to push yourself as hard or go as far as you would if you were
00:10:31 hungry. So it's this kind of mentality I've always struggled with because because I've
00:10:37 been raised in like a Western culture you know in America the first method of like constant
00:10:42 growth and the hunger mentality dominates our culture it's everything in America is bigger
00:10:47 better faster stronger all that shit. So that's the kind of mentality that I've always adopted
00:10:54 and I definitely feel like because of my like mental deficiencies you know my clinical depression
00:10:58 and things like that it makes it very difficult to achieve that because you need to be confident
00:11:02 in yourself you need to be able to take hits and keep going and because I'm just very mentally
00:11:06 up unstable being able to power through things like that is very difficult and that leads
00:11:12 to a lot of my problems that I've had in the last couple years trying to make it as a content
00:11:15 creator. So the allure of trying to like go inward and find this gratitude and this inner
00:11:20 peace of this other sort of mentality is very appealing but I just feel that it would it
00:11:26 would be counterintuitive to what I want to achieve long term I want to be big and this
00:11:31 is the thing like even my idea of being big is like I'd like 100,000 subscribers or something
00:11:36 like that an audience big enough to sustain me financially so I can do what I want to
00:11:40 do but the the growth minded mentality would say that that's thinking too small I need
00:11:45 to be like the biggest youtuber of all time I gotta make millions of dollars I gotta grow
00:11:50 bigger bigger bigger and like I gotta take my 100,000 no no times about 100 you need
00:11:54 10 million 100 million like that's what you need to shoot for and it's just this like
00:11:59 I don't want to say greed but you're tap dancing on the line between ambition and greed by going
00:12:05 for this hardcore and it really needs you to have an ego and I definitely don't have
00:12:09 one so this is just one example but there's tons of other examples in life of like arguments
00:12:15 being made that both seem equally cogent and it really comes down to personal preference
00:12:21 and the problem is when you're somebody who's looking for answers which is how you're going
00:12:25 to run into all these kind of things in the first place you are looking for answers so
00:12:31 when you're presented with multiple choices you're not really in the mindset of like trying
00:12:35 to sift through all these things you're looking for someone to tell you what you need to do
00:12:39 because the whole problem is you don't know what to do so when you're presented with multiple
00:12:43 options that seem good you're kind of just giving yourself a new set of problems as
00:12:48 opposed to finding the solution you were looking for so this is something that's always bothered
00:12:53 me because I'm I have a pension already to be analysis paralysis of just like being overloaded
00:12:59 by choice and they're not making any choice I'm very susceptible to falling into this
00:13:02 trap of being like this is a good idea but this is a good idea but this is a good idea
00:13:06 too so which idea do I want to do and it seems like the only thing I can do is just play musical
00:13:12 chairs with them essentially and keep trying one out and seeing if it works for me or not
00:13:17 but even then like I'm always trying to look for the objective truth and it's arguable
00:13:21 that there is no objective truth but I think in the confines of our reality I think there
00:13:26 are definitely choices that have more merit than others like even if I said you know what
00:13:31 I'm just going to be a gratitude minded like in the back of my head I'm always going to
00:13:35 be like but you could be doing better you could be doing more you could be bigger and vice versa
00:13:39 the other way like if I'm constantly hungry and keep climbing the ladder I'm just like
00:13:43 you could just calm down you know you could take a moment and just kind of like clear
00:13:48 your head a little bit and not be so voracious all the time like just chill so I don't know
00:13:55 that's that's really all I want to say is a short episode but that's what I'm bitching
00:13:59 about is that I just I wish things were simpler I wish maybe if things can't be simpler I wish
00:14:06 we were given more tools growing up to face things like this there because in our inner
00:14:13 education system it feels like to be at least in my experience is that it's very much one answer
00:14:18 you know they give you the answer they prep you for that answer and there's there's a linear
00:14:22 progression in learning things and you know especially in school there's never multiple ways
00:14:28 of doing things it's always like this is the one way regurgitate what we've told you you can't
00:14:32 really come to differing conclusions for the most part and college sometimes you can but even then
00:14:37 it depends on who's teaching the material so in light of not being able to simplify a complicated
00:14:43 world I wish we were better prepared to make complicated choices at least me so that's all
00:14:49 I got for this episode of the hyperbolic wine chamber it's good to be back check the links
00:14:53 below if you want to donate to the wine fund if you want to support me and all my other content
00:14:57 in the long term you go to patreon.com slash save me a dollar a month gets you a bunch of extra
00:15:01 stuff including cool art things and you can rant at me about how dumb I am or whatever so until
00:15:08 next time Tom Oliver this has been the hyperbolic wine chamber have a good one
