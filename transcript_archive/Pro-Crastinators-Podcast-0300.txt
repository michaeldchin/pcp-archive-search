00:00:53 come on, come on, come on, come on come on, come on, come on, come on
00:01:23 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck. I'm going to fucking withdraws. Oh god. Oh fuck. I gotta put that
00:01:39 Give a better than occasional guest right into my veins. Oh god. Oh fuck.
00:02:10 Oh no. Hey everybody. Excuse me. Excuse me. What's going on? What's going on here?
00:02:20 You're all banned. You're all gone. You're all killed. It's 2018, Give. Nothing bad ever happened
00:02:27 ever. No. Get out. Get out. I'll attack you. I'll kill you. I killed Ben. This is the
00:02:34 announcement of the episode 300. Ben's dead. It's my show now. It's my show. It's Gib show.
00:02:39 Yo. Oh hell yeah. Let's start. Let's just fucking. Fuck yes. Give. I really like this
00:02:47 comic you started. I think it's going places. Thank you. Oh you know what? You can stay.
00:02:55 You're too kind. What a generous overboard. Money. YouTube dollars. See this is what happens
00:03:00 when a YouTube channel is run by a woman. They kill their co-host.
00:03:08 But they accept compliments. That's the that's what happens. Let me check all that city.
00:03:15 Should we be already recording? I mean Craig's recording right now.
00:03:18 Craig was recording so it's fine. I don't trust Craig. I'm recording. I'm recording right now.
00:03:27 I don't trust him. I'm sorry about my recording in a second.
00:03:33 Well you know it's a nice year 2018. Wait when did the PCP started? 2016? Was it before that?
00:03:43 Oh yes. I forgot. It was very late. It was late 2050 and it was right at the end of 2050.
00:03:49 Yes. Let me check. It was one or two episodes in the year. The PCP outlasted Trump. That's funny.
00:03:55 Oh yeah. First episode. So December 2015. Hey Ben. It's me. What the fuck Ben? I killed you.
00:04:03 I stabbed you. I saw you die. She did. You wish. It's a guess like a girl boss.
00:04:10 Oh no. That was your ninja clone jutsu. It was just a log.
00:04:17 It was just a log that appeared in a poof of smoke. I know you've just been waiting
00:04:22 until the day that I die and you can take over the PCP. Damn it. It was my big plan.
00:04:27 You'll curl claw this PCP for my cold dead hands. But instead of a log it's a
00:04:34 even the whip blurry. Yeah. Instead of a log it's the lord of ghosts. I can't hear anything.
00:04:42 We're all on left. That's because Gabe stabbed you in the ear so that's why you can't hear anything.
00:04:48 Can we invite like CMC and pretend like he's Jesse?
00:04:59 We need Jesse. I think we're fine. We've got Jeff, we've got Monkey, we've got Nate.
00:05:09 Who can be mage? Like Gamer's Tavern? No.
00:05:15 No. Yeah, that sounds about right.
00:05:20 Oh, Lumia, it feels made to Jason. Oh god. That is true. Where is Tom Oliver can come back and play the boo.
00:05:36 That's great. That's great. Perfect casting.
00:05:38 Okay, I'm going to take this opportunity to pee. I'm going to also pee.
00:05:48 Don't do it, guys. Wake up at 1am for this and you two need to pee.
00:05:54 Just pee in a cup. Just pee on stream.
00:05:59 Yeah, 1am then.
00:06:02 1am waking up in the morning. Gotta be fresh. Gotta go downstairs.
00:06:07 Gotta have my ball. Gotta have cereal. I'm pretending to be Monkey Jones.
00:06:18 Okay, I'm trying to think of like what Monkey sounds like and my first thought in my head was
00:06:24 like Jacksepticeye's intro where he does the whip crack and he's like, what top of the morning to you?
00:06:29 And I'm like, that's not... I've never heard Jacksepticeye's intro.
00:06:36 Oh, you got it. Let me get the... Oh, you haven't lived. You haven't lived.
00:06:43 She's not wrong. She's not wrong. I watched the beginning of a Monkey video before I showed up
00:06:47 and it's like, hey, everybody, it's me, Monkey Jones. So it sounds like it's...
00:06:52 It's Monkey Jones here. I'm fresh out of... I'm fresh out of fucks to give and I'm ready to rape you.
00:07:07 That's what he says, right?
00:07:12 You know what? I think we should recast Ben as Monkey and I should pay Ben.
00:07:16 All right, all right, this is a video. You should just watch this video.
00:07:20 Oh, god. Come at the morning.
00:07:26 Okay. I think I've seen this one. Oh my god. Fucking rape my ears.
00:07:32 I need to make a version of this with, like, all of the...
00:07:35 Hello and welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast and have that be the intro.
00:07:38 You need to make one with the...
00:07:40 Is that the bite of 87?
00:07:43 It's the bite of 87. It's always the bite of 87.
00:07:46 I need to grab, like, 100 episodes of the PCPs and, like, put all of them in one audacity and,
00:07:52 like, have them aligned where Nate says, hello and welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast
00:07:57 and then it's just incomprehensible noise on either side of that.
00:08:02 Why don't you make a noise album or radio oblivion?
00:08:05 You know you want to.
00:08:06 Who's oblivion?
00:08:08 Can you make a noise album already, Jeff?
00:08:11 Now you want to.
00:08:12 Yeah. If algorithm... I don't know what Jeff means.
00:08:16 I just know he's a money machine.
00:08:18 I was, um...
00:08:19 I was, um...
00:08:20 He's the paper's gone.
00:08:21 I was editing the, uh...
00:08:23 I was editing the documentary yesterday.
00:08:26 It's so fucking weird that Jeff is in there.
00:08:29 He's just walking around.
00:08:32 Just walking around.
00:08:33 Documentary?
00:08:35 Yeah, Radcom the Documentary from the Blu-rays.
00:08:38 Oh, shit.
00:08:39 Yeah.
00:08:39 I guess I should mention, uh...
00:08:42 Yeah, I'm, uh...
00:08:43 I'm gonna put...
00:08:44 Along with the 300 episode, I'm gonna put out, yeah, Radcom the Documentary.
00:08:49 There's no, like, ending.
00:08:51 It's just, like, random footage.
00:08:53 It just ends at no particular point.
00:08:57 Uh...
00:08:59 It's just, like, two hours of random footage from Radcom, too.
00:09:02 Oh, my God.
00:09:03 Yeah.
00:09:04 Oh, and I guess, uh...
00:09:06 I'm gonna put out that along with episode 300.
00:09:12 And I think, Gib, I think we're gonna do a commentary, right?
00:09:15 We're gonna do a commentated version.
00:09:17 Are we?
00:09:17 With all the slur...
00:09:19 Yeah!
00:09:19 With all the slur...
00:09:20 With all the slurs.
00:09:22 Unedited.
00:09:23 No.
00:09:24 Well, the private version.
00:09:26 Private version.
00:09:27 I'm taking them out.
00:09:28 I'm cutting that out of the public release.
00:09:32 Of course.
00:09:33 It's not the...
00:09:36 It just ends.
00:09:38 I don't know.
00:09:38 It's, like...
00:09:39 I think Victor edited it, but it's just, like, random footage.
00:09:44 And there's no point.
00:09:45 There's no, like...
00:09:49 There's no start.
00:09:50 You just end it.
00:09:53 It starts...
00:09:54 It starts like it's gonna go somewhere.
00:09:56 It starts like there's gonna be a point to it.
00:09:58 Like, it's gonna tell a story.
00:10:00 And then the footage just becomes, like...
00:10:04 It's just random things that happened up until, I think, you know...
00:10:09 Jeff arrives, and then Jesse arrives.
00:10:12 And then it's like, well, we're all here.
00:10:15 And then we were just, like, fucking around in the living room.
00:10:18 And then that's the end of the documentary.
00:10:21 That's exactly what the PCP is.
00:10:24 Yeah, yeah.
00:10:24 You just end with a fade into black and say a text that says,
00:10:28 and nothing bad ever happened.
00:10:33 That's such a good idea, Nate.
00:10:34 They made so much content.
00:10:36 And everyone was content with the content.
00:10:39 And it was fine.
00:10:41 Just to check, let me see how many episodes of the PCP I've ate.
00:10:46 Gotta be...
00:10:47 Is it 100?
00:10:48 It's probably less than 100, right?
00:10:53 Oh my god, no, it's more than 100.
00:10:54 Are you serious?
00:10:57 I started with Christian Minecraft and Soup.
00:11:00 I guess we should talk about this on the episode.
00:11:02 I'm recording already.
00:11:04 Is everyone else recording?
00:11:05 Yeah, I'm recording.
00:11:06 I said when I was recording.
00:11:07 Recording.
00:11:08 Recording.
00:11:09 I mean, Craig is recording.
00:11:12 It's recording, all right.
00:11:17 Just notice.
00:11:18 They uploaded to Spotify the rooftop performance of the Beatles from Get Back.
00:11:24 And to listen to that.
00:11:26 Sometimes I forget that you and Lane had huge Beatles heads.
00:11:32 I used to be an Amos swan's head.
00:11:34 You should listen to swans, each one.
00:11:39 Yeah, it's a funny guy screaming.
00:11:42 If I wanted to listen to that, Elisa, I'd listen to the PCP.
00:11:47 Cute laugh track.
00:11:49 A funny guy's creamy.
00:11:52 Yeah.
00:11:55 That's he then.
00:11:56 You're the funny guy.
00:11:57 Although keep in mind, the Beatles do scream a lot.
00:11:59 You know, I just, I just...
00:12:02 I saw, I had a little bit of a panic attack when I looked at the chat and I saw Jeff and
00:12:07 Mumkey and Nate in here.
00:12:11 But now I realize, I'm looking again and I'm like, oh wait, it's that picture of Mumkey.
00:12:16 Yes.
00:12:19 Wait, where's...
00:12:21 Is that really the picture from the sextet?
00:12:23 Yes, it is.
00:12:24 Yeah.
00:12:24 Yeah.
00:12:24 Oh my God.
00:12:25 I've seen it.
00:12:26 I've seen it.
00:12:26 I've seen it.
00:12:27 It's so weird.
00:12:28 It feels weird.
00:12:28 I haven't seen it.
00:12:30 And I...
00:12:31 It's very strange.
00:12:32 I mean, whatever.
00:12:35 It's pretty funny.
00:12:37 I don't feel that.
00:12:38 I don't feel bad laughing because he filmed it on purpose.
00:12:41 So, like...
00:12:42 I mean, yeah.
00:12:43 Yeah, it's, it's, yeah.
00:12:45 I don't feel, I don't feel bad.
00:12:47 But when you record it, it's very...
00:12:48 When you record something like that, you're like, need to expect this.
00:12:53 It is going to get leaked.
00:12:55 Only if you're a public figure.
00:12:57 Yeah.
00:12:58 All right.
00:12:59 It could have been, that could have been me, that could have been me having sex with that
00:13:06 furry pedophile, if only, if only the dice of history had landed a little differently.
00:13:13 To see that you needed to be with sheep over first.
00:13:17 You need to be with someone who treated you well.
00:13:19 So, so you'd be sick of them and treat them bad.
00:13:25 If only.
00:13:29 Okay.
00:13:29 So, is this the episode?
00:13:30 Have we started?
00:13:31 I started.
00:13:32 I didn't think we had.
00:13:33 I thought this was...
00:13:34 I thought you saying you killed Ben was a cold open.
00:13:38 That could go right at the beginning and then Ben could appear and I like that part.
00:13:43 That could go that open at the beginning.
00:13:46 Well, I'm recording.
00:13:46 So, fuck it.
00:13:47 I am recording.
00:13:48 Let's sync.
00:13:50 Okay.
00:13:50 On the count of three, say sync.
00:13:52 One, two, three, sync.
00:13:54 Sync.
00:13:55 Sync.
00:13:55 One, two, three, sync.
00:13:57 Sync.
00:13:58 Sync.
00:13:58 Sync.
00:14:01 Hello.
00:14:03 I'm the nostalgia critic.
00:14:04 And this is the Procrastinators podcast.
00:14:06 The podcast that thinks racism is good and civil rights are bad.
00:14:11 I'm Ben Sane.
00:14:16 And this is everyone else.
00:14:19 What's going on?
00:14:22 Nothing.
00:14:24 Just episode 300 of a show that we're in.
00:14:28 This is 300.
00:14:29 Hello, it's me, Jeff.
00:14:30 I read the algorithm and it said,
00:14:32 I should come on to the PCP for big YouTube money.
00:14:36 Jeff sitting in his pondering chamber
00:14:41 observing the algorithm like his wizard's orb,
00:14:44 just reading the signs and the tea leaves.
00:14:49 Somebody else go.
00:14:50 Hey, it's me, Monkey Jones, freshly reborn from Nate's Busy
00:14:54 and ready to take a hold of my personal responsibility.
00:14:59 Oh, my God, he's monkey.
00:15:02 Oh, I didn't see him there.
00:15:03 I hope you like that impression.
00:15:05 I'm not doing it again.
00:15:06 It's Monkey Jones here.
00:15:08 I had to commit a real life school shooting.
00:15:12 Hey, it's Monkey Jones.
00:15:14 It's a school shooting.
00:15:15 I mean, I'm taking a camera into the girl's bathroom.
00:15:22 It's me, Monkey Jones here to commit real life sex crimes.
00:15:27 Let's let's get into it.
00:15:29 Shall we put some typo?
00:15:33 And it's me, Nate.
00:15:38 Today we're going to talk about personal responsibility.
00:15:43 Personal fucking responsibility.
00:15:45 It's going to be a five hour podcast of that.
00:15:47 You can't believe like you can fix poverty
00:15:49 just by telling people that it's their fault, but they're poor.
00:15:53 Yeah.
00:15:54 It's really amazing.
00:15:55 Jeff.
00:15:56 I can't believe you can fix suicidality
00:15:59 by cheating on your girlfriend with a pedophile.
00:16:02 Oh, Jeff, you and your lib, you and your libcuck ways,
00:16:08 you and your, you probably voted for Hillary
00:16:11 because your sex worker girlfriend told you to.
00:16:16 Fuck you.
00:16:16 Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
00:16:18 Yeah.
00:16:18 Actually, you fucker, you got me.
00:16:22 I know.
00:16:23 Die.
00:16:25 Oh, fuck, Jeff's dead.
00:16:27 Shit.
00:16:27 Darn.
00:16:29 Now, now what'll I do?
00:16:31 Now what big money connections will I use
00:16:33 to get ahead in the YouTube game?
00:16:36 This is stupid.
00:16:38 I know it's stupid.
00:16:39 I know.
00:16:40 Jeff's dead.
00:16:40 Oblivion Falls here.
00:16:41 Hello, welcome to the PC.
00:16:42 Wow, it's Oblivion Falls.
00:16:43 I prefer that person.
00:16:45 Oh, shit.
00:16:46 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:16:47 Is that Seachole?
00:16:49 Oh, yeah.
00:16:49 Seachole?
00:16:50 I like Seachole.
00:16:51 Oh my god.
00:16:52 I broke, I broke through the shell that was monkey Jones.
00:16:55 I split myself out of his organs and now I am here.
00:16:58 I've killed him.
00:16:59 You are all saved.
00:17:02 Thank god.
00:17:03 Praise him.
00:17:05 That's me, Elia, Sardator of the BCP.
00:17:07 Elia, is I the editor of the pro?
00:17:09 Pressnators is here.
00:17:10 Dude, that guy's famous.
00:17:15 Are you guys hungover?
00:17:16 I'm hungover.
00:17:16 I feel terrible.
00:17:17 No.
00:17:18 Oh, no.
00:17:18 What happened?
00:17:20 You drunk alcohol?
00:17:20 Why are you drinking alcohol?
00:17:22 Tragically, I did.
00:17:23 Tragically, I didn't buy a bottle.
00:17:25 My, well, my good friend John, a.k.a.
00:17:28 D'Wubo, invited me over for a Friday game night and I bought a beer and I drank it.
00:17:38 And I guess, and I guess I, you know, I was too, you know what?
00:17:40 I was just too demure.
00:17:42 I was too like, I was, I was so focused on making a good impression and being polite
00:17:47 in polite company that I was like, no, no, no, I can't, I can't drink water.
00:17:52 I must not drink water from the tap to prevent a hangover.
00:17:56 Yeah.
00:17:56 So now here I am dehydrated and in agony.
00:18:00 And that's, and that's just how it goes sometimes.
00:18:04 Why not drink water?
00:18:05 That's so silly.
00:18:06 I told you why because I wanted to make a good impression on polite company.
00:18:12 What would they have thought if they had saw me drinking water?
00:18:15 They would have thought you didn't want to be a hangover.
00:18:18 They would have shaken their head and said, what an filthy animal, filthy animal.
00:18:21 Why he might as well be drinking, he might as well be drinking it directly out of an
00:18:25 outhouse latrine.
00:18:29 No.
00:18:31 That you would think it's bad to drink water.
00:18:33 I don't want people to think badly of me.
00:18:36 No, he thinks it's bad to drink water from the tap specifically.
00:18:39 These, these friends that I've known for years and years, if they saw me drinking water,
00:18:45 they would, they would, they would lose all their respect for me.
00:18:49 They don't sound like very good friends when you put it that way, Ben.
00:18:51 You know what?
00:18:52 You're right.
00:18:53 Fuck those guys.
00:18:55 Damn.
00:18:56 I was hungover on Saturday because instead of sleeping, I was in the pronoun server
00:19:04 watching Dog Day Afternoon, which is an amazing movie.
00:19:09 It's about Al Pacino robbing a bank to get money for his wife to get a sex change.
00:19:17 Uh, it's from the 70s.
00:19:19 It's a great movie I recommend it.
00:19:21 Like, like a trans woman, like his wife is a, is a, is an MTF and wants a sex change.
00:19:28 Yeah.
00:19:29 Neat.
00:19:30 The head of it, the head of its time.
00:19:32 And it's like from like 75 the movie.
00:19:34 So it's like, it really is a hit of the time.
00:19:36 Damn, be gay, do crimes.
00:19:38 Is she like a prostitute?
00:19:39 Is he like falling, falling in love with a prostitute?
00:19:42 And it's like, I'm going to get you as that sex change I always wanted and then we're going
00:19:45 to run away to Mexico together.
00:19:49 Oh no.
00:19:49 No, they run to Wyoming.
00:19:51 Okay, that's good.
00:19:52 That's good too, I guess.
00:19:56 I watched a movie.
00:19:58 Tragically, I watched a film this, this week.
00:20:01 Oh my god.
00:20:03 I know.
00:20:03 I never do that.
00:20:04 The story is I saw, I saw a random tweet that was like, hey, it was a random tweet
00:20:11 in appreciation of some filmmaker who had made two movies before dying at the age of 39.
00:20:20 And it said both.
00:20:22 Both of this guy's movies are on some fucking streaming service.
00:20:26 I think I still have the tab open.
00:20:28 Wait, the streaming service is...
00:20:37 Tooby.
00:20:38 Tooby.
00:20:39 And it was like...
00:20:39 Tooby.
00:20:40 Yeah, T-U-B-I.
00:20:41 And this guy made two movies.
00:20:43 One is called Night Vision and the other is called Mind Killer.
00:20:46 And I was like, fuck it.
00:20:48 And I went and I watched Mind Killer.
00:20:50 And it was okay.
00:20:52 It was bad.
00:20:54 But I guess it had some charm to it.
00:20:57 It had some things that I liked.
00:20:59 I liked the nerdy friend side character who liked to howl like a coyote.
00:21:06 He was charming.
00:21:08 It's about a nerdy weirdo who has no success with women
00:21:13 and watches like pickup artists' self-help videos.
00:21:19 He works at a library and he finds a manuscript that teaches him
00:21:27 concentration exercises to unlock the power of the mind.
00:21:30 And it turns him into like a psychic genius and he becomes like a sociopath freak.
00:21:38 Who like controls women's minds to fuck them.
00:21:42 I'm looking at the poster of the movie.
00:21:44 And this looked like when I ate the PCP.
00:21:49 Hold on, I don't even know what the poster looks like.
00:21:50 They should have called the movies Night Killer and Mind Division.
00:21:55 Hold on.
00:21:55 Hold on.
00:21:56 I gotta see this.
00:21:56 That Rubik's Cube sucks.
00:21:59 I gotta see this shit for myself.
00:22:00 Is that only three colors?
00:22:01 In general.
00:22:03 It is.
00:22:03 It's a three-color Rubik's Cube.
00:22:08 Wow, this poster actually is exactly what the movie is like.
00:22:13 This is exactly what it's like.
00:22:15 Warren's brain is out of his...
00:22:18 Ew.
00:22:20 You know what?
00:22:21 In hindsight, this movie ruled.
00:22:23 This is a great film.
00:22:25 Looking at this poster, I'm like, hell yeah.
00:22:30 This is what March Simpson looks like.
00:22:38 I feel like I'm gonna say...
00:22:40 This is like a thing that like an idiot...
00:22:42 This is like a thing that an idiot would say to sound...
00:22:46 But think they sounded smart.
00:22:48 And other idiots would think, wow, this guy's really smart.
00:22:51 The appeal of this movie was not so much in the monster
00:22:54 and in the special effects and in the horror.
00:22:56 It was about the characters.
00:22:58 You know, it was about the characters really.
00:23:00 It was about getting invested in their characters.
00:23:02 And then only then did the fear and the terror
00:23:06 presented by the creature and the horrific scenario,
00:23:09 you know, impact one emotionally.
00:23:12 When one was already invested in the drama
00:23:14 of these characters and their lives,
00:23:17 much like a film ought to do, right?
00:23:19 Wow.
00:23:20 Yeah.
00:23:21 Sounds like at the end of every nostalgic critic review
00:23:24 where he gets serious and he actually reviews the movie.
00:23:26 This episode of the Road Runner, the Coyotean Road Runner,
00:23:31 it says so much with just a desert road
00:23:35 and a rock dropped off of a cliff.
00:23:38 It really shows the dichotomy between men, you know,
00:23:40 a wolf and a road runner.
00:23:43 It's a coyote.
00:23:46 Yeah, same diff.
00:23:50 No.
00:23:51 Well, cool.
00:23:53 I didn't watch a film.
00:23:54 Good.
00:23:55 Don't.
00:23:55 So I will never speak of such things.
00:23:57 Don't waste your life like I did watching one movie.
00:24:03 While you were studying...
00:24:04 It's 90 minutes.
00:24:05 I'll never get back.
00:24:07 While you were watching simple media made by artists that suck.
00:24:13 He sucks so much, he's literally dead now.
00:24:19 He died at 39.
00:24:20 I was studying.
00:24:21 Just like you will when I get through with you.
00:24:25 In many years time.
00:24:27 Yeah, in nine years or so.
00:24:32 11 years.
00:24:33 Right, okay.
00:24:35 Close enough.
00:24:37 I've been getting really into ancient history and geography and stuff
00:24:45 because springing off of my world building sort of interest,
00:24:50 building maps and stuff and mountains and being like,
00:24:54 oh, lore, you know, like how do I make lore?
00:24:57 How do I make a lore of like ancient civilizations
00:25:00 that rose and fell and wars they had?
00:25:02 Oh, I'll look at history.
00:25:03 And now I'm just into history videos.
00:25:07 I know why you've been looking into this stuff and I'm surprised.
00:25:12 I'm surprised that you've delved deeply into it, I guess is what I'm...
00:25:18 Wait, you know why?
00:25:20 Partly, yeah.
00:25:23 I don't know if I can say it without spoiling stuff.
00:25:28 Maybe you're thinking of something else.
00:25:30 Maybe I am thinking of something else.
00:25:32 My secret project.
00:25:34 Isn't this stuff involved with like your secret project and the backstory for it?
00:25:40 Yes, yes, a little bit.
00:25:43 A little bit, okay.
00:25:46 I just think it's cool.
00:25:47 I just think it's neat that like, you know, things happened
00:25:51 and people wrote it down so we can learn about it.
00:25:54 Dude, people had cats and...
00:25:56 It's just so novel that I can read like letters
00:26:01 I can read funny lines on a page or hear them spoken by a person
00:26:06 and like get a sense of stuff that was happening before I was born.
00:26:14 Isn't that crazy?
00:26:16 Like the Beatles?
00:26:18 Yeah, there's kind of still alive.
00:26:21 I can walk around in Colombia in Bioshock Infinite
00:26:26 and I can pick up little record tapes and play them and people say,
00:26:30 hey, and people say, hello, everybody, welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast.
00:26:36 You can listen to podcast episodes.
00:26:38 You can find on little tapes that people left scattered around the wreckage of the former world.
00:26:45 Like an annoying like secret.
00:26:46 Like you've got like this big open world like fallout or whatever
00:26:50 and the logs are entire episodes of the Procrastinator's podcast.
00:26:57 And then like four hours later, you're still playing the game,
00:26:59 listening to this thing I'm like...
00:27:01 I think when Phantom's Revenge is done,
00:27:04 I think I'll have to start work on a new game that is just a walk around like world.
00:27:08 It's just a post-apocalyptic walking simulator.
00:27:11 There's no combat, nothing happens.
00:27:13 You just walk around and you pick up audio logs that are just all 300 episodes of the PCP.
00:27:21 And you piece together the wreckage of the old world.
00:27:27 You should make that game.
00:27:27 Like in 200 years from now, in 200 years from now,
00:27:30 it would be the younger video game Nerdmeme.
00:27:33 It's like, hey, wanna listen to some tunes?
00:27:35 Hello, it's the piece, the Procrastinator's podcast.
00:27:39 What you should do is you could put them on little tapes
00:27:42 and then spread them out in the real world.
00:27:45 And then they'll be like a weird mystery that people will freak out about.
00:27:49 The literal lust tapes.
00:27:51 I like that.
00:27:52 And then we archive the PCP.
00:27:56 I mean, I have a burner.
00:28:00 I have dick.
00:28:03 Those discs could be cheap.
00:28:04 One episode of the PCP would probably fit on...
00:28:08 It'd be pretty small, right?
00:28:10 It'd be a pretty small file.
00:28:11 You could fit that out.
00:28:12 As an audio file, yeah.
00:28:13 It wouldn't have to use...
00:28:15 Yeah, it's like an MP3.
00:28:17 It wouldn't have to use a whole 50 gigabyte Blu-ray disc.
00:28:21 I could just use some fucking like four gig.
00:28:24 Some four gig shitty CD, yeah.
00:28:27 No problem.
00:28:27 I mean, I was thinking of literal cassette tapes, but I can't.
00:28:31 But nobody has a player for those anymore.
00:28:33 No, no, no.
00:28:34 Exactly, only true chats can actually listen to them.
00:28:37 Wait, I should just leave them around on the USB thumb drives.
00:28:42 Just leave them scattered around in garbage cans.
00:28:46 Leave them scattered in garbage cans for civil waste municipal sanitation workers
00:28:53 to find.
00:28:54 Only the big market for the PCP is garbage men who find it in trash cans scattered
00:28:59 around Boston, Massachusetts.
00:29:02 I can guarantee no garbage man actually.
00:29:04 You could look at the waveform and then film the waveform with an old timey camera
00:29:15 and then make a film real of the waveform that people will have to look at and then
00:29:21 decode and turn it into audio so they can listen to it.
00:29:26 There's like a skill floor.
00:29:28 A skill floor for listening.
00:29:31 You know, and they get like arguments about Final Fantasy and Pokemon as the reward.
00:29:37 Do you know about the Boyager, the gold disc that they send to
00:29:41 space for the Martians to find?
00:29:44 The what they send?
00:29:45 Not Martians, just anyone.
00:29:47 Aliens, just aliens in general.
00:29:50 It's like they send a satellite into space just to travel around the whole galaxy with a gold disc.
00:29:56 Oh, does it with the little plaque on it that has those things that they hope will be decodable
00:30:03 and understandable by anyone?
00:30:05 Yeah, they should send another one with PCP episodes on it.
00:30:10 No, I don't think.
00:30:12 I think they've suffered enough being aliens and all.
00:30:15 Talking about.
00:30:15 Where's Ben?
00:30:16 Ben died.
00:30:18 Ben did die.
00:30:19 We're talking about ancient history.
00:30:20 I watched this video, just the archaeology I swear to explain.
00:30:27 That was that was a really interesting theory that I found there that I don't know if you
00:30:33 know this kind of statues are very famous.
00:30:35 Oh, I've seen that statue.
00:30:36 We've talked about this stupid thing.
00:30:39 I hate this thing.
00:30:40 Why do you hate it?
00:30:42 It is ugly.
00:30:43 Yeah, look at it.
00:30:45 Why do you hate it?
00:30:45 I hate it for the same reason I hate you.
00:30:48 It's ugly.
00:30:50 Oh my fucking god.
00:30:52 Typical white male opinion.
00:30:54 I know, right?
00:30:55 This is the right thing to say.
00:30:58 What's ugly about her?
00:31:00 There was a theory that's like.
00:31:02 Got no face.
00:31:03 She looks she's basically she's basically been saying look at that cap.
00:31:06 She's pulled it so down low.
00:31:09 It's just like Ben's saying.
00:31:12 It's just too close to home.
00:31:14 It hits too close to home.
00:31:16 That's why you have to lash out.
00:31:17 You can't you can't handle it in the video.
00:31:21 There's the theory of why they look like that.
00:31:23 And it's that since they had no mirrors,
00:31:26 they just like look below their bodies and that's how they saw their bodies.
00:31:29 So that's how they that's the best.
00:31:31 Tarbuck transom said the same thing in a voicemail.
00:31:34 Stupidest fucking thing I ever heard.
00:31:36 That was making sense.
00:31:37 Just look at another human being.
00:31:39 Yeah, yeah.
00:31:40 Yeah, I know why they look like that.
00:31:42 It's because back in the day,
00:31:44 there was a prehistoric oblivion full who needed to make people
00:31:47 with fat tits.
00:31:49 That's all about them hips.
00:31:51 It's all about them titties.
00:31:52 It's all about that little chub.
00:31:54 You need that.
00:31:55 Yeah, that's what that's about.
00:31:57 That weird like hoof foot mess at the bottom there.
00:32:01 Feed a hug.
00:32:02 I'll tell you what that's up.
00:32:03 Have you ever noticed that like 50% of porn artists just never draw feet?
00:32:07 The image always comes off at the ankle.
00:32:08 I have noticed that.
00:32:09 And I always find it to be.
00:32:10 All artists never draw feet.
00:32:11 They just cut them off.
00:32:12 It's it's so much easier and I hate it.
00:32:15 But I also I'm like, I guess if I want to draw more often,
00:32:22 I should I should take shortcuts where nobody cares.
00:32:25 Nobody actually wants to see the except specific feet people.
00:32:29 That's exactly it.
00:32:29 I mean, like that's what you do in life in everything you do.
00:32:32 You got to be like, how can I what's the cheapest way I can do this?
00:32:36 The easiest possible way so I can do so I can do more of it.
00:32:40 The only reason Quentin Tarantino shows the feed is because he's like,
00:32:43 look, I'm not taking shortcuts.
00:32:44 See you.
00:32:47 He didn't saw off their feet to make the access cheaper.
00:32:51 You know, speaking of fertility goddesses, this month I came up with Febubrary.
00:33:00 Hashtag Febubrary, which is rolls right off the tongue.
00:33:05 It rolls right off the page, not off the tongue.
00:33:09 You can't say it, but you can read it.
00:33:11 Um, and I'm like, I wanted to draw more like titillating imagery
00:33:18 because I just need practice in that.
00:33:19 And I like the idea of being good at that.
00:33:23 And that's what I'm doing this month.
00:33:24 It's a gimmick art month, just like many other gimmick art months
00:33:27 where you do something every day for a month.
00:33:29 And I'm drawing a boob every day, kind of sort of.
00:33:33 I'm putting it on Twitter.
00:33:35 How's this for a gimmick month?
00:33:38 Uh, hold on.
00:33:42 January, February, March.
00:33:43 How about ape, uh, ape, ape, live April?
00:33:48 How about April live real where I just am alive?
00:33:51 I just live for every, every day.
00:33:54 I just live in a hole all day every day.
00:33:57 Oh, sounds like a hustle.
00:33:58 30 times a month.
00:33:59 I, I like April where in April you draw ape.
00:34:03 Just draw apes.
00:34:05 It's too, in 2022 it's a little, it's a little NFT adjacent.
00:34:10 It makes me a little uncomfortable.
00:34:13 But they do be monkeys though.
00:34:14 They do be monkeys though, but, but they just,
00:34:19 you know, it's, if it's ape adjacent, it's just, it's just,
00:34:22 there's something, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?
00:34:25 It's too, I don't know.
00:34:27 Make an active effort to co-op the apes back from the NFT bros.
00:34:32 And I steal that property.
00:34:33 They love so much.
00:34:35 We do have to reclaim.
00:34:36 We have to reclaim the apes.
00:34:38 You know what I haven't, you know what?
00:34:39 I haven't seen a lazy lion in months.
00:34:41 Everyone forgot about lazy lions.
00:34:43 Oh my gosh.
00:34:44 The apes are still around.
00:34:45 The apes are the ones that everyone knows,
00:34:46 but the lions are gone.
00:34:48 So that's cool.
00:34:49 I, I, I unfortunately was, I was approached by someone
00:34:53 who, they were really desperate to message me.
00:34:55 They pledged to my Patreon.
00:34:57 They tried every avenue to be like,
00:34:59 hey oblivion, oblivion, I've got an idea.
00:35:01 I've got an idea.
00:35:01 It's going to be big.
00:35:02 It's you, you're going to want to do it.
00:35:03 It'll, it'll be bigger when it comes on.
00:35:06 It'll be the biggest thing ever, please.
00:35:07 I have such a good idea.
00:35:08 And I'm like, I, I didn't get back to him for a month
00:35:11 because I was like, I had just caught COVID
00:35:14 around the time I saw their messages.
00:35:15 And I'm like, I'm a fucking bleh.
00:35:17 And then they unplugged my Patreon.
00:35:19 So I'm like, I'll, I'll get back to you later.
00:35:22 Eventually message them on Discord.
00:35:24 Turns out they're just an ideas man.
00:35:27 And I mean, okay, they want to get the ideas good.
00:35:31 They didn't give me specific ideas for what their idea was.
00:35:34 So I'm like, I don't know.
00:35:35 How can I know if this is worth my time?
00:35:38 But I checked again the next day and they have since then
00:35:42 now have a fucking monkey profile picture.
00:35:44 And it, there's a little Discord verified sticker next to it.
00:35:48 And I'm just like, oof.
00:35:50 I'm a little, I mean, you say they're an ideas man.
00:35:53 Like what did they, what did they want?
00:35:56 I don't know.
00:35:57 They're like, it's going to be the next come zone.
00:35:59 What's going to be the next come zone?
00:36:01 What?
00:36:01 I don't know.
00:36:02 They have ideas apparently.
00:36:06 What are you talking about?
00:36:08 Like, do they have lyrics?
00:36:10 Do they have, what do they have?
00:36:12 I don't know.
00:36:13 I mean, I don't know.
00:36:14 Well, what did they expect you to do before they would explain it?
00:36:18 Did they say, like, give me your bank account information
00:36:21 and I'll tell you all about it?
00:36:22 Like, what would they say?
00:36:24 I don't know.
00:36:26 Look, when I make my Discord, like my Patreon Discord,
00:36:29 I will let them join.
00:36:31 And, and if they want to like explain it forever,
00:36:33 like I'll hear them out because it's possible they'll have an idea.
00:36:36 And I'll be like, oh yeah, that sounds fun.
00:36:37 Maybe I do want to do that.
00:36:38 But like, currently I have, I don't know.
00:36:42 Oblivion, I have a great idea.
00:36:44 It's possible the sun won't rise tomorrow as well.
00:36:47 Yeah.
00:36:48 Yeah, hear me out, Billy.
00:36:48 It's going to be the next come zone.
00:36:50 It's going to be the next come zone.
00:36:51 This idea is so great.
00:36:51 Are you ready?
00:36:53 Yeah.
00:36:54 Okay.
00:36:54 So, Fed Boop Worry, right?
00:36:57 Oh my God.
00:37:00 We just do that on the PCP, on the PCP, on the draw cast with Giv.
00:37:05 Oh yeah.
00:37:05 We give on, we do one of the short quick episodes of Fed Boop Worry.
00:37:08 Okay.
00:37:09 What about this?
00:37:09 We should do an episode that isn't tits and ass, it's just tits.
00:37:14 And then later, we can do an episode that's just ass, you know?
00:37:17 Hell yeah.
00:37:18 What about, oh yeah, we'll do an episode called Top Heavy
00:37:21 and then we can do another one called Bottom Heavy.
00:37:22 What about, what about?
00:37:24 What about July?
00:37:26 A month where every day I say I'm going to do something but I don't do it.
00:37:32 Wait, what?
00:37:33 Listen, listen, if I didn't-
00:37:34 July, July, a month where every day I say I'm going to draw something but it's a lie
00:37:39 and I don't do anything.
00:37:41 Sorry, I was thinking of an alternative spelling then.
00:37:44 Yeah.
00:37:45 I feel like that would encourage certain individuals that I know to get on my back
00:37:51 about certain things.
00:37:52 Okay, okay, I didn't even think of that.
00:37:54 I was just, I was just thinking.
00:37:55 Wait, how did you not think of that?
00:37:56 That was a great, that was a great, like funny joke that you just did.
00:38:00 Max, you would have been so proud of you, you know, before he died in the war.
00:38:05 I was just going for the lie part of it.
00:38:07 I don't know.
00:38:08 Listen, I don't see, I don't see color.
00:38:11 Unlike whoopie gold, unlike whoopie Goldberg, I don't dehumanize the Jews
00:38:15 by calling them white.
00:38:17 All right.
00:38:18 Elias are eight that out.
00:38:20 You always heard of that out.
00:38:22 My God.
00:38:24 Definitely.
00:38:25 If it was for Madrakas, I would have fucking bleeped that whole thing.
00:38:30 You would, you would just cut it.
00:38:32 You would have just straight up cut it.
00:38:32 When are we going to make the Garfield episode?
00:38:36 Oh yeah, you want to do another Garfield episode?
00:38:38 I mean, we did one already.
00:38:40 No, we did one.
00:38:41 It was just a comic jam.
00:38:43 Yeah, we need, we need a Garfield episode.
00:38:45 That's just Garfield.
00:38:47 How about Garfield boob?
00:38:49 No, no, no, no, no.
00:38:50 Wait.
00:38:51 Arlene's a pretty, is a sexy, sexy cat.
00:38:55 Oh, fuck that cat.
00:38:56 I'd fuck that, I'd fuck that cat for a dollar.
00:39:00 Oh my God.
00:39:04 You just reminded me.
00:39:06 Have you seen this meme?
00:39:08 It's awful.
00:39:09 It's so bad, huh?
00:39:10 I have to pull this up.
00:39:13 Apparently it's from 2017, but I never heard of it to now.
00:39:16 It's a brick and roll.
00:39:18 Creative, it's like normal people versus creative people.
00:39:21 Oh, the dragon, the dragon cooking the turkey.
00:39:24 The dragon.
00:39:25 Oh no.
00:39:25 Yeah, yeah.
00:39:26 What?
00:39:27 Wait.
00:39:27 For creative people, it's like a dragon lives in their oven, cooking their fucking turkey.
00:39:33 Wait, what?
00:39:34 It's the person who said that.
00:39:35 It's the most boring individual I can imagine.
00:39:38 Bore on, yeah.
00:39:38 Creativity is Western fantasy and nothing else, yeah.
00:39:42 Yeah.
00:39:43 Like, I'm not like other girls, but just slightly different.
00:39:47 I'm not like,
00:39:48 I'm not like other girls.
00:39:49 When I play tennis, I think it's a sword instead of a racket.
00:39:53 I'm not like other girls.
00:39:55 I watched Lord of the Rings.
00:39:58 That's it.
00:39:58 Yeah.
00:39:59 Yeah.
00:39:59 Are they Lord of the Rings?
00:40:00 Which one?
00:40:01 I'm not like other girls.
00:40:03 I'm not like other girls.
00:40:04 I have dissociative identity disorder.
00:40:07 I am a danger to myself and others.
00:40:10 I'm not.
00:40:10 I'm not like other girls.
00:40:12 I'm a boy.
00:40:13 Hold on, I found it.
00:40:15 Let me get these images up.
00:40:16 Wait, is it like that thing from The Little Prince
00:40:18 where grown people see a hat and a little kid see an elephant with a rope?
00:40:25 I mean, it looks like the elephant is underneath the hat.
00:40:30 You say an elephant with a rope and all I can think of is an elephant committing suicide.
00:40:33 Why would you put that inventory into my head?
00:40:38 Ordinary people, creative people, yes.
00:40:41 So apparently creative means you also have like bad eyesight, I guess.
00:40:46 This one, I saw, the original one is, you know, four different things.
00:40:55 It's not all dragons.
00:41:01 Creative people just can't do anything without thinking there's a dragon present.
00:41:10 Guys, this burning is crutch for the dragon.
00:41:13 I'm looking up the sky, but wouldn't it be great?
00:41:17 I was being fucking burned alive.
00:41:22 It's just the same drug.
00:41:27 This also was, oh god, there's one not included in that image.
00:41:32 That's like a fucking, when I saw this, I thought this was a parody.
00:41:38 Because I, well, first glance, I thought the the conclusion would be creative people just
00:41:42 want to fuck the cat, but it wasn't.
00:41:45 No, it was disappointing.
00:41:46 Ordinary people, because not that.
00:41:49 I don't like the dog, but really, what do we need him for?
00:41:51 This is okay.
00:41:52 I took matters into my own hands.
00:41:53 Oh my god, this is so awful.
00:41:57 I'm looking, okay, the original, the original one is so, it's almost as bad.
00:42:03 It's almost as bad as this like joke version.
00:42:05 So ordinary people see a purring cat, creative people imagine the cat is talking like it was in
00:42:11 like a cheesy DreamWorks film.
00:42:15 God of some kind.
00:42:18 This way, look at this one.
00:42:19 Look at this one.
00:42:20 Okay, ordinary people, water bear flower, creative people imagine like, what if my
00:42:25 flower was like a little bit bigger?
00:42:29 What if it was ever so slightly bigger than it actually is?
00:42:34 That flower was from Undertale.
00:42:37 Yeah.
00:42:39 Creative people wear a slightly like fit flowier dress and they dye their hair and they have
00:42:47 glasses and some and several necklaces.
00:42:50 Ordinary people just wear gray and they don't wear any necklaces at all.
00:42:54 If you look closely, you can see, you can see that the way they're pouring their water is more
00:42:59 like there's more force coming out.
00:43:02 So creative people care more about watering the plants.
00:43:06 Creative people care more about over watering their plants and then getting upset when their
00:43:10 plants are dead.
00:43:12 Just like the mom of the guy who created the mental like, unlock the power of the mind guy
00:43:19 in Mindkiller.
00:43:20 His mom was like crazy lady and she was like, don't overwater the plants.
00:43:26 There's all her fault.
00:43:27 The nurse is over watering the plants.
00:43:29 I'm going to lose my fucking mind.
00:43:33 That's what happened.
00:43:34 That's what happened in the movie.
00:43:35 In the movie I saw.
00:43:38 Dude, this is the guy we went and he was like, oh, you know, you know what I'm fucking talking about.
00:43:48 Oblivion is a great name.
00:43:49 The skeleton appears.
00:43:53 It's not even, it's not even creative people.
00:43:55 It's just like, what if it's instead of an ordinary day?
00:43:58 The skeleton appeared.
00:44:00 The skeleton.
00:44:02 I like how it's not a skeleton, it's a de-skeleton.
00:44:06 The one.
00:44:07 I'm going to steal that and use that elsewhere.
00:44:09 Thank you.
00:44:11 The skeleton appears as a, it's been going around.
00:44:16 I just ate a whole pint of Nick's Swedish chocolate ice cream and none of you even knew.
00:44:22 None of you even knew that I was eating while I was talking to you.
00:44:25 You fucking morons.
00:44:26 Okay.
00:44:26 In post.
00:44:27 Nimrods.
00:44:29 No, in post.
00:44:30 I'll just add like, sounds.
00:44:34 Look, Elias, I'll get some food.
00:44:36 I'll start eating and then you just take my audio of me eating and put it when Then was eating.
00:44:42 No, it'll be too sexual if you do that.
00:44:44 Elias R, put at the beginning of this episode, when I say the thing about the documentary,
00:44:54 the documentary, I have it open.
00:44:57 I went through, I watched Radcom the documentary.
00:45:00 I made a note of all of the slurs that need to come out.
00:45:04 There's about one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
00:45:09 There's about 10, there's 10 of them.
00:45:11 I'm going to edit those out.
00:45:12 Those are going to be, we're going to, we're going to commentate it.
00:45:15 We're going to put the, that's going to be Patreon.
00:45:17 Patreon bonus.
00:45:20 Patreon paying for slurs.
00:45:22 Paying for, yeah, well, yeah.
00:45:25 Well, basically, yeah.
00:45:26 Most people pay people not to be racist, but people pay you to be more racist.
00:45:31 I was a little bit, I was, you know, I was a little bit hopeful.
00:45:34 Okay, I'll admit, I'll admit to this.
00:45:36 I was a little bit hopeful that Jeff would say a slur and I would have to edit that out,
00:45:42 but he doesn't, because I know that that would bug him.
00:45:44 I know that that would bug him, but he did not on, not on camera anyway.
00:45:49 He didn't say any slurs on camera in the, in the documentary.
00:45:52 So good for him.
00:45:54 I may, no, I said the R word.
00:45:56 I said the R word one time in the documentary.
00:45:58 I'm not going to cut that.
00:45:59 I'm not going to cut that out, but I'll bleep it.
00:46:01 I'll bleep the R word if you, if they haven't said it a few times.
00:46:04 What's the R word on the PCP?
00:46:06 Like, you know, you know, retarded, the, the, the, the retarded word.
00:46:12 Oh, I thought you meant like something like rapist or.
00:46:15 No, no, I'm leaving.
00:46:16 I'm leaving raping.
00:46:17 I'm leaving raping.
00:46:19 I'll preserve the integrity of God.
00:46:21 Bricks in, atelisms out, kids.
00:46:24 That's right.
00:46:25 That's correct.
00:46:26 Just so you know, the title of this episode will be Nate Returns.
00:46:30 Yes.
00:46:31 Whatever you want.
00:46:33 Listen, I don't care.
00:46:35 I'm hungover.
00:46:37 It's, it's, it's over for me.
00:46:39 I've decided to never drink water again.
00:46:42 Why?
00:46:43 I've decided this is, this is the end.
00:46:45 You know, this hangover is good, actually.
00:46:47 This hangover is good.
00:46:48 I'm just going to lean into it.
00:46:49 I'm just going to lean into it and just go hard.
00:46:52 And this is it.
00:46:53 This is where it ends.
00:46:57 Just going to, just going to drive right off this cliff that I'm on.
00:47:03 So this is, this is the PCP, right?
00:47:06 So this is the, this is right.
00:47:07 This is episode 300 of the Procrastinators podcast.
00:47:10 Does that mean it's okay for me to talk about the new Pokemon game?
00:47:14 Oh, Jesus.
00:47:15 Oh, no.
00:47:18 Well, I haven't played it, but I mean,
00:47:20 I suppose there's whatever.
00:47:22 It looks good.
00:47:23 It looks fun.
00:47:23 And I like the look of it.
00:47:24 I have not, I don't have any opinion.
00:47:27 Okay.
00:47:28 It's fun.
00:47:29 It's a different kind of game.
00:47:31 Some people might not be partial to it, which is fair enough.
00:47:34 I don't believe you.
00:47:36 But I had, that's why it looks good to me.
00:47:38 Yeah.
00:47:39 I had fun sneaking around in the grass,
00:47:41 trying not to get killed by giant Pokemon.
00:47:46 I caught a massive Lopini.
00:47:48 She's twice my size.
00:47:49 It's great.
00:47:50 That's pretty cool.
00:47:52 Can you have sex with the Lopini?
00:47:54 Exactly, dude.
00:47:55 This is, this is set like back in the day when people and Pokemon were equals,
00:48:01 you know, when they were seen of as equals.
00:48:04 And you're the newfangled person going around putting these things into balls.
00:48:09 Is it, okay.
00:48:10 Isn't there a line in one of the games where they say that like people
00:48:13 and Pokemon used to marry each other?
00:48:15 So something basically equivalent to that.
00:48:17 Yeah.
00:48:18 Yeah.
00:48:21 And this is the, and this game is set in those times in the olden days.
00:48:25 Yes.
00:48:25 And you get a massive Gardevoir.
00:48:27 I got a Gardevoir and she's the same size as me.
00:48:30 And I'm looking around for a massive Gardevoir.
00:48:33 Can you make your Gardevoir fuck your Lopini?
00:48:37 Oh, that's a great idea.
00:48:39 I don't even want, I don't even want sex with the Pokemon.
00:48:42 I just want to make them do it and watch.
00:48:45 The bonus points if they don't want to do it, but I make them anyway.
00:48:51 You can toss your Pokemon out.
00:48:53 Yeah, you need a pretty high gym bench level.
00:48:56 Yeah, you need to have beaten all the gyms or else they won't fuck.
00:48:59 But if you get enough gym badges, you can make over the canteen.
00:49:03 I know, because it's like.
00:49:04 If you have enough gym badges, Pokemon have to consent to sex them.
00:49:09 You're on their trainer.
00:49:10 You are their owner and they are your possessions.
00:49:13 You say when they have sex or not, I think so.
00:49:16 I think because this is a back in the day, you're like a little adventurer.
00:49:22 You're like making the Pokedex.
00:49:24 And it's a little book because of course it fucking is.
00:49:28 Of course it is.
00:49:31 I just read the last creative one and got to the part where you have to use your pee.
00:49:37 Yes.
00:49:39 I didn't read it before.
00:49:43 And it throws to the little flower.
00:49:44 You have to water me.
00:49:46 You have to use your pee.
00:49:48 You have to water me.
00:49:51 Ow, ow, ow.
00:49:53 OK, the rib cage.
00:49:55 That's a lot of people too.
00:49:57 They are massive Loponies and massive Garth was.
00:50:02 Yeah, it's fun.
00:50:03 It's a fun game.
00:50:04 It is a Pokemon game.
00:50:06 Some people might not be satisfied.
00:50:07 But you know, I'm depressed, so I have no standards.
00:50:11 I used to when I was playing fun, comfort game where I roll around in the town.
00:50:18 Yes.
00:50:19 High five.
00:50:22 Pokemon challenges said that like the new the new like battle style is cool,
00:50:27 but there's only like five of them in the whole game.
00:50:30 Five what?
00:50:32 Of like a new some like new style of battle.
00:50:35 Oh, yes.
00:50:36 That's for like specifically like battles or something.
00:50:38 Yes.
00:50:39 There are like the noble the noble Pokemon or whatever.
00:50:43 Yes.
00:50:44 Basically, they've they've they've taken some ice and they're trying.
00:50:50 God gave them some ice and now they're trying to kill everybody.
00:50:53 God gave them ice like like jewels.
00:50:56 Like the like the drug then.
00:51:00 Ice like they're high.
00:51:02 OK, OK.
00:51:03 Like like God zaps them with electricity and made them go crazy.
00:51:08 Gotcha.
00:51:09 Yeah.
00:51:10 Ice ice baby.
00:51:10 Like like the like the government body.
00:51:14 Yes.
00:51:16 Like vanilla ice.
00:51:19 Like ice cubes.
00:51:20 Yeah, ice tea.
00:51:22 Anyway, God fucked them up.
00:51:24 God fucked them all up and now they're going crazy.
00:51:27 And you're the kid that got isekai to this land and everyone's like,
00:51:30 hey, kid, you're not scared of Pokemon.
00:51:33 I saw you walk up to a cricket to your super powers that you don't know
00:51:41 that you should be afraid of the power is that you are from the future
00:51:46 and therefore are unafraid of Pokemon because you can be babies.
00:51:51 But in this world, they will kill you and do try to.
00:51:55 Hmm.
00:51:58 Oh, yeah, it sounds.
00:52:00 Should I?
00:52:01 Well, I don't have a switch, so I don't even have the means to play it.
00:52:06 I wouldn't I wouldn't get a switch just to play it.
00:52:09 If I had a switch, maybe I would buy it just to fuck around.
00:52:12 I don't know.
00:52:13 Yeah, babe has a switch and he bought this game for himself
00:52:17 and therefore also bought it for me.
00:52:20 Who did?
00:52:21 Babe, my partner.
00:52:22 That's what I call my partner.
00:52:23 Renown character, babe.
00:52:26 Yeah, everyone's favorite character, babe.
00:52:28 Yeah, babe, pig in the city, as I was going to say.
00:52:30 Yes.
00:52:32 Don't tell them my secret.
00:52:34 I call them.
00:52:36 When you when you.
00:52:36 Yes, I read that out.
00:52:37 I read that out.
00:52:38 I read that out.
00:52:38 I read that out.
00:52:39 I want people to think I'm white like Shane Dawson or something.
00:52:43 Time to go.
00:52:44 Time to go get a girlfriend just so I can start calling her pig in the city.
00:52:50 We know what it means.
00:52:51 We know what it means.
00:52:54 You know, the only reason I want to get married so that I can say,
00:53:00 hey, that's my wife you're talking about.
00:53:03 Yeah, so I can punch people and say.
00:53:06 And say, what are you doing to my wife?
00:53:08 But she's not even there.
00:53:09 She's not even anywhere, anywhere nearby.
00:53:11 Allison, why don't you just marry Lane and then you also get citizenship in America?
00:53:17 Or she gets citizenship where you are.
00:53:20 Having a wife is reason to punch people.
00:53:23 It's reason to punch someone, I think.
00:53:26 I don't know why it's also a reason to punch people.
00:53:29 Yeah.
00:53:31 Punishing people is good, actually.
00:53:34 There's never not a reason.
00:53:36 You know, I've done the math.
00:53:37 To commit assault.
00:53:38 So I've done the math and I've edited a hundred and twenty two episodes of the PCP.
00:53:44 My God.
00:53:46 You're insane.
00:53:47 I was a young innocent 17 year old child and now I'm 20 years old.
00:53:53 A hundred.
00:53:54 Wait, a hundred and twenty two.
00:53:57 But that's yeah, it's a lot.
00:54:00 But that's but that's so too many.
00:54:03 It can't be.
00:54:03 It's not even it hasn't even been that many episodes.
00:54:06 Ben, don't panic on don't panic on me.
00:54:11 No time to panic attack right now.
00:54:14 Ben, I'm trying to gaslight you so it doesn't have to pay you.
00:54:16 You're full.
00:54:18 There hasn't been that many episodes.
00:54:20 No, no, you only ate 20.
00:54:22 That's right.
00:54:23 That's right.
00:54:23 I don't think we I don't think I agreed.
00:54:25 I don't think we agreed to pay you for a hundred and twenty two episodes.
00:54:29 And yet here we are.
00:54:30 This is this Chris Chan and soup.
00:54:32 Is this the first one you did?
00:54:33 No, that is the first one.
00:54:35 Damn.
00:54:36 Well, I I didn't think.
00:54:40 I didn't think you didn't.
00:54:41 I didn't think you'd be doing it for that long.
00:54:43 But I guess time.
00:54:43 A hundred and twenty one is our I did edit one of those since then.
00:54:47 Remember.
00:54:47 Oh, that's right.
00:54:48 That is right.
00:54:50 So Ben was right.
00:54:50 You haven't done that many.
00:54:52 Ah, you know, you know, how the funny story of how, like,
00:55:00 for the eight or contest, I think, like, I tie with first place with.
00:55:05 I don't remember who.
00:55:07 But you just won because you were just so much powerful than us.
00:55:11 We pick.
00:55:12 Yeah, we.
00:55:12 Yeah.
00:55:13 We had a couple.
00:55:14 There were there were there were a few that we liked.
00:55:17 I can't remember you talking about that green, fleshy flowers was a name that was
00:55:21 bandied about.
00:55:24 Yeah.
00:55:25 That guy is an art guy.
00:55:29 That guy.
00:55:29 I'm assuming that they do the sketchy people podcast.
00:55:33 Yeah.
00:55:33 Yeah.
00:55:33 When I look at those videos, I see all the little TVs and I'm like, oh, yeah,
00:55:36 that's similar to what they did for the PCP, isn't it?
00:55:38 Yeah.
00:55:39 He has another he has another handle that he uses.
00:55:42 He's got like two and green, fleshy flowers is one of them.
00:55:46 I forget what the other one is.
00:55:48 But that guy's good.
00:55:49 The guy's good at art.
00:55:52 I don't know.
00:55:53 Back at that time, when you won, I have I have sworn revenge.
00:55:58 I will as I will fly to America and kill oblivion fall for taking this opportunity from me.
00:56:04 Somebody's got to do it.
00:56:06 Somebody look at us and we're best friends.
00:56:12 It's true.
00:56:14 Oblivion.
00:56:16 Oh, yes.
00:56:17 Hello.
00:56:17 Sorry.
00:56:18 You got distracted for like a second.
00:56:20 This is this is like the worst hangover I've ever had.
00:56:24 This is so bad.
00:56:25 I can't even believe it.
00:56:26 I didn't even drink anything that bad.
00:56:27 I just drank beer.
00:56:29 It was just beer.
00:56:30 And on the 300 episode of the podcast, Ben,
00:56:34 I like Chuck vodka and I don't have hangovers as bad as this.
00:56:37 I'm not old.
00:56:38 I'll never be old.
00:56:40 You keep telling yourself that, sweetie.
00:56:42 You keep telling yourself that I'm just going to do a Carl Pilkington.
00:56:46 And when I get old enough, I'll just start aging in reverse and become a baby again.
00:56:50 Oh, yeah.
00:56:50 You wish.
00:56:51 Ben says, I will never get old also.
00:56:55 300 episodes of the PCP.
00:56:56 Oh, no, no.
00:57:02 It's true.
00:57:03 It's true.
00:57:05 I'm not old.
00:57:05 I'm just dehydrated.
00:57:07 I just need some water to fill my cells.
00:57:11 You need water from the fountain of youth.
00:57:13 Yeah, I love that part of the Caribbean movie.
00:57:17 I love Jesse's review of that movie.
00:57:21 I don't remember that.
00:57:23 I haven't seen Pirates of the Caribbean 5, but Jesse did like an hour long review.
00:57:28 We're halfway through it.
00:57:28 He just breaks down and starts screaming, my doubter.
00:57:32 And it was funny and I liked it.
00:57:34 I remember my doubter.
00:57:35 I remember my doubter.
00:57:36 My doubter.
00:57:37 My doubter.
00:57:39 It's good stuff.
00:57:41 People who don't watch Jesse Conn and are missing out looking at you, Simsie.
00:57:46 Do you think to just send Simsie piss style on repeat?
00:57:52 P-style.
00:57:53 P-style.
00:57:54 Piss style.
00:57:54 I was thinking of Piss Christ.
00:57:55 I should just do that, yeah.
00:57:57 Wait, Piss Christ?
00:57:58 Yeah.
00:57:59 You know about Piss Christ, right?
00:58:01 No, what's Piss Christ?
00:58:02 Wait.
00:58:02 How do you not know about Piss Christ?
00:58:05 I don't know.
00:58:11 Elisa, you need to read the Bible.
00:58:13 Yeah, I'll send you.
00:58:15 There's a picture of Piss Christ.
00:58:16 People get really offended about Piss Christ.
00:58:20 What do you think Piss Christ is, Oblivion?
00:58:23 I think Piss Christ is Jesus.
00:58:25 Okay, it's like a reverse urinal.
00:58:27 You walk into the bathroom and instead of a urinal that you pee into,
00:58:30 there's like a sculpture of Jesus on the cross and he pisses on you.
00:58:34 Okay, what do you think?
00:58:36 What do you think Piss Christ is, Elisa?
00:58:38 What do you think Piss Christ is, Elisa?
00:58:41 Jesus Christ drank holy water and he holy pissed on everyone.
00:58:47 Okay, cool.
00:58:49 Here's Piss Christ.
00:58:51 Here he is.
00:58:51 He's entering General Chat.
00:58:55 It's Jesus Christ on the cross and a giant piss that someone took a photo of.
00:59:01 Why a piss jar?
00:59:02 That's like, that's baby shit.
00:59:03 Come jars of the real effort.
00:59:06 Because it's us.
00:59:07 This looks like a great album cover for a heavier record.
00:59:14 Because also because it was made in 1987.
00:59:18 It was made in 1987 by Andre Serrano.
00:59:23 Oh, so it's old.
00:59:23 Is that the title of the album?
00:59:25 Yeah, it's old.
00:59:26 It's old and French, so it's old.
00:59:28 Really? I thought this was like made a couple years ago.
00:59:30 It's American, actually.
00:59:31 Okay.
00:59:33 Hmm, hmm, yeah.
00:59:36 All right.
00:59:37 I'm going to go back to sleep.
00:59:39 End of the episode.
00:59:40 Are we done?
00:59:41 No.
00:59:43 You're going to go back to sleep.
00:59:44 You're going to go back to sleep.
00:59:46 You all get Ben.
00:59:48 Ben, do you remember what time it is for me?
00:59:49 Mr. Ben St. You're going to go back to sleep?
00:59:52 You said it's like 1 a.m.
00:59:53 Is it time to get vaccinated?
00:59:56 I already did.
00:59:56 I've had all my jabs.
00:59:57 I'm a good boy.
00:59:58 Is it time?
00:59:59 I haven't, should I still haven't got my booster?
01:00:03 Is there even any point anymore?
01:00:05 Is there even a point to getting boosted?
01:00:07 Is there a point to anything?
01:00:08 Any of this?
01:00:10 After 300 episodes,
01:00:11 should I even bother getting the booster
01:00:12 or should I just let COVID take me?
01:00:14 Just let it take me, just sweep me off into the...
01:00:17 You've already had COVID, Ben.
01:00:18 Trump won't do anything.
01:00:20 Look at me, my maid.
01:00:21 Yeah.
01:00:22 Yes, I know.
01:00:23 I'm so proud of you, Ken.
01:00:24 Look at it.
01:00:24 That's good.
01:00:26 Also made a fucking template as well.
01:00:30 I made the flower turn its frown.
01:00:32 Smile upside down as well.
01:00:37 You're a genius, Ken.
01:00:38 But it still has the heart.
01:00:40 It still loves it.
01:00:42 That's great.
01:00:46 Creative people.
01:00:47 Creative people have...
01:00:50 They dye their hair.
01:00:51 They dye their hair.
01:00:52 Just like you.
01:00:53 That's true.
01:00:54 Just like me.
01:00:55 That's how we know that you're creative.
01:00:56 I'm not creative anymore
01:00:57 because my hair is normal now.
01:00:59 What the fuck?
01:01:00 You just have to re-dye it, Ben.
01:01:01 The branding, the branding, Ben.
01:01:03 The pink is gone.
01:01:03 The pink...
01:01:04 No, they have no more brand.
01:01:06 My hair is normal color,
01:01:07 and I don't vape anymore.
01:01:09 And what...
01:01:10 Who are you?
01:01:10 Normal color.
01:01:11 What's the point?
01:01:14 What's the point?
01:01:14 Are you even doing keto?
01:01:17 I have been.
01:01:18 But the strip doesn't turn purple.
01:01:22 I think you just fucked up your body, Ben.
01:01:24 I have been eating so clean.
01:01:29 I have been eating so strict.
01:01:30 I've had a very strict low calorie regimen.
01:01:33 And yet...
01:01:34 And yet the keto strip does not turn purple.
01:01:38 I don't know if it's because...
01:01:39 It must be the water.
01:01:40 The water can't be keto.
01:01:41 Oh, I have stuff to drink in water.
01:01:43 I can only drink alcohol from now on.
01:01:45 Yeah, yeah.
01:01:46 Maybe you're pregnant.
01:01:48 I wish.
01:01:54 That was said almost like sincere.
01:01:57 It was too sincere.
01:01:59 Too sincere.
01:02:01 Yeah.
01:02:02 You could have a keto bun in the oven.
01:02:07 I just...
01:02:09 I don't understand.
01:02:10 I don't understand why I'm not in keto mode.
01:02:12 I've been very...
01:02:14 I've been very scrupulous about it.
01:02:16 And yet...
01:02:16 And yet...
01:02:17 Listen, Ben.
01:02:18 It just doesn't happen.
01:02:19 Your keto in our hearts, okay?
01:02:21 Oh, thanks.
01:02:25 Yeah, that'll...
01:02:25 Means nothing.
01:02:27 Yeah, that'll keep me at it.
01:02:30 That'll keep my body weight optimal.
01:02:32 Yeah, sure.
01:02:34 Just jump into your death.
01:02:36 I think I have lost some weight, though.
01:02:38 I've been...
01:02:38 I'm not in keto, but I've been eating very...
01:02:40 I've been eating at low calorie.
01:02:42 And I think I have lost a little bit.
01:02:43 I think I look pretty good.
01:02:45 I looked in the mirror the other day and I was like,
01:02:46 fuck yeah.
01:02:47 So you know what?
01:02:48 It's fine.
01:02:49 It's good.
01:02:49 Lamal.
01:02:50 Yeah.
01:02:53 All right.
01:02:53 I have a small topic.
01:02:55 It's sort of like a two-part topic.
01:02:57 Let it to what I've been working on the last couple of days.
01:03:01 So does anyone remember a video by a guy called Noodle
01:03:04 talking about AI interpolation for animation?
01:03:09 Yeah, I've seen that.
01:03:10 Yeah, I think so.
01:03:12 Maybe.
01:03:12 I don't know if I actually watched it.
01:03:14 I would like to destroy the purpose.
01:03:17 Yeah.
01:03:17 Every time you see a video, it's like anime fight scenes in 60 FPS.
01:03:23 Track down the people who made those videos
01:03:25 and kill, oh wait.
01:03:27 I can't actually.
01:03:28 And kill them?
01:03:29 I can't kill them.
01:03:30 I want to say that, but I'm not allowed to.
01:03:32 Because of how YouTube-
01:03:32 Why do you chose this?
01:03:34 Look, in Minecraft, okay?
01:03:36 Just destroy the ship.
01:03:37 Blow up the house in Minecraft.
01:03:38 Exactly, exactly.
01:03:39 You hear that, Susan Wojcicki?
01:03:41 It makes me so mad.
01:03:42 It makes me so mad that people,
01:03:44 one, don't understand that 24 frames per second
01:03:47 cannot be converted to 60 frames per second
01:03:49 without fucking up literally everything.
01:03:53 Even if you have a line moving at a set speed,
01:03:58 it'll get fucked up because going from 24 FPS to 60 FPS,
01:04:04 some of them will have to be split into two frames
01:04:07 and some of them will have to be split into three frames
01:04:09 and it'll just make all the motion look jumbly and bad.
01:04:13 And also the AI does a shit job anyway
01:04:15 because it doesn't know what the fuck it's doing
01:04:17 because it was trained on live-action footage and not cartoons.
01:04:21 It's all just terrible.
01:04:22 But.
01:04:23 It is.
01:04:24 But, but.
01:04:25 That doesn't stop me.
01:04:27 You see, I am a smart boy.
01:04:29 I am using AI interpolation for my own animations
01:04:32 to double the frame rate.
01:04:34 And it does kind of a crappy job.
01:04:36 I'll show like a little example.
01:04:39 I'll drop a little mini MP4 in chat
01:04:42 because I've been manually cleaning up all the frames
01:04:44 that got fucked up, right?
01:04:48 And that's just what I've been doing for the past couple of days,
01:04:50 just painting out all the mistakes that the AI made.
01:04:53 But it has actually saved me a lot of time.
01:04:55 And I'm not applying the AI to the end product for 60 FPS.
01:05:00 I'm actually just using it for basic in-betweens at 30 FPS.
01:05:04 And I'm doing the cleanup before all the effects
01:05:08 and all the camera shake and all the gradients and bloom
01:05:10 and all that shit goes on top.
01:05:12 So it's actually working out pretty well
01:05:14 and I've pretty much finished all this work.
01:05:16 And that's what I've been working on.
01:05:18 I like how the cleanup video is just a close-up of the kuchi.
01:05:22 Yeah.
01:05:22 Not that big.
01:05:23 Can I post this?
01:05:24 Can I like show this on the video?
01:05:27 Just put a demonetization symbol over the poos
01:05:30 and you'll be fine.
01:05:31 Okay.
01:05:32 Or I do remember seeing this noodle video.
01:05:36 Those are the things with like video
01:05:40 Dragon Ball Z, but a thousand frames per second.
01:05:43 I never click on them because I know they're stupid.
01:05:46 And this noodle thing was like,
01:05:51 yeah, animation fundamentals don't work
01:05:54 because AI doesn't know whether something is supposed
01:05:57 to be bouncy or not, or what is the meaning
01:06:01 of the movement in the scene.
01:06:03 You can't say that.
01:06:05 It cannot best go in between two different frames
01:06:08 and if it understands what a human face is and what an arm is,
01:06:12 it can be like, okay, this is the arm here.
01:06:14 This is the arm here.
01:06:15 So we need to make a frame in between that meshes them.
01:06:19 But like for intent, it's hard or impossible for an AI
01:06:23 to like know what the hell of like an action scene is trying
01:06:27 to do, especially with a cartoon.
01:06:30 We needed some AI to act.
01:06:32 People love it though.
01:06:33 People really enjoy looking at those videos.
01:06:37 It's like-
01:06:37 Because we're stupid.
01:06:39 Not like go out and make their brain feel good.
01:06:41 It's like, do you remember AT Audio?
01:06:44 It's just like music that pans all over your head.
01:06:48 It's like that.
01:06:49 It's just like gaming.
01:06:53 You know when like a 3D has like
01:06:57 tastefully decided to run at a lower frame rate
01:07:02 for like effect or-
01:07:03 Like spider-verse and stuff, yeah.
01:07:06 And you know, there's always going to be that
01:07:08 sect of people who look at it and they notice that is not as
01:07:13 smooth as other three-dimensional imagery they've seen before,
01:07:16 such as a 60fps game.
01:07:18 They will think of it as bad animation.
01:07:22 Yeah, I saw that.
01:07:23 Even though they're like, they're basing it on like stupid things,
01:07:28 it is the response they have.
01:07:31 I don't know really what the solution to that is.
01:07:33 Um, the solution is you need to-
01:07:34 Kill them.
01:07:35 Like it's a legitimate response.
01:07:37 Like people feel-
01:07:39 It's because they've played too many video games that they think,
01:07:42 oh, oh, it's dropping frame rate.
01:07:44 Oh, I'm bad.
01:07:44 And that's the response they like have been like led to expect.
01:07:49 They, I bet they don't even realize that like every fucking like 2D animated
01:07:54 movie ever made is animated on twos and frees for the most part,
01:07:58 using ones like sparingly.
01:07:59 Sure, sure.
01:08:00 Like every Disney movie, everything.
01:08:02 And no one thought that looked bad.
01:08:04 No one ever thought there was a problem with it.
01:08:06 Um.
01:08:07 I think there's more to just like people being stupid.
01:08:11 I think, like, because people don't complain about those Disney movies
01:08:16 because it's not even noticeable that it's at a lower frame rate.
01:08:22 For some people, for, I don't know.
01:08:24 I don't know how to describe it.
01:08:26 I just feel like there's more going on than people thinking about video game frame rates.
01:08:33 Yeah.
01:08:34 Sometimes things do look-
01:08:34 Maybe it's just like, okay.
01:08:38 Maybe it's like-
01:08:39 Not in a bad way, but like in an artistic way that they're just not ready to accept.
01:08:43 I don't know.
01:08:44 Like maybe they, like they see the low frame rate, they notice it,
01:08:48 but they don't know what to say about it.
01:08:51 So they like interpret it as like something to criticize.
01:08:55 Yeah, so-
01:08:56 Even though it doesn't look bad.
01:08:57 Like nobody thinks that like Spider-Verse looks bad because-
01:09:00 Oh, there are people who think it looks bad.
01:09:02 I've seen people who can-
01:09:03 Do they actually, or do they think that they ought to think it looks bad?
01:09:09 Because-
01:09:09 Like there are some people who said that like, because it's actually a mixed frame rate.
01:09:13 Like Spider-Verse is animated at 24 FPS.
01:09:15 I'll say at least half the movie is animated on ones.
01:09:18 And things are only animated on twos in a way that looks good,
01:09:21 like in a way would for 2D animation.
01:09:24 The thing about 2D animation is like in-betweening everything on ones,
01:09:29 which basically means that every single frame is a new drawing,
01:09:32 doesn't always look better.
01:09:34 Using twos and frees sparingly can actually improve the look of the animation
01:09:38 and help it feel more like organic and good and stuff.
01:09:41 I know.
01:09:41 Oh, no.
01:09:42 I know that.
01:09:43 You know.
01:09:44 And especially for like limited animation as well.
01:09:47 And using those techniques for 3D is like really cool.
01:09:51 And Spider-Verse did it extremely well.
01:09:53 Like the animators, people seem to think that like,
01:09:55 oh, they were being lazy.
01:09:56 They were just cutting corners and saving on costs.
01:09:59 That is like provably false because even on frames
01:10:03 where the characters are standing like still for like two frames,
01:10:06 the lighting still moves.
01:10:08 Like if there's a lighting effect but it's moving on ones,
01:10:11 like you'll see the light update on their model even though the model is like still.
01:10:15 This is like that old DigiBro video about Kill-a-Kill.
01:10:19 And this is like the Kill-a-Kill, you know, the parts where like a limited thing,
01:10:27 a thing doesn't move.
01:10:29 But it's like, yeah, Kill-a-Kill did like super like limited,
01:10:32 like they use like tweens and stuff in a way,
01:10:34 like for comedic effect that looked really good.
01:10:35 Yeah, they use it for comedy.
01:10:37 Like it's obviously, they're obviously doing it on purpose,
01:10:40 like because it, yeah, for effect.
01:10:43 I think that's the main thing is when it's used for effect
01:10:47 and the effect doesn't distract from the content
01:10:52 of the scene or whatever is trying to be shown.
01:10:54 If like you're watching something and the main thing you get out of it
01:10:59 is that the frame rate is like notable,
01:11:04 then the animation hasn't really done a good job at like making you not think about that
01:11:10 and instead pay attention to like the thing that's happening.
01:11:13 I mean, if you're watching a scene and all you feel about it is
01:11:18 the like something about the frame rate seems weird to you,
01:11:21 then like I guess the artists has failed, right,
01:11:26 in making the scene effective in the way they wanted to.
01:11:30 There's definitely a lot of like misunderstandings and like pseudo,
01:11:37 like what's the term for someone who thinks they know what they're talking about but they don't?
01:11:43 Pseudo-intellectual?
01:11:46 I don't know if it starts with pseudo, but like, yeah, basically it's like people
01:11:50 thinking that they have
01:11:55 like a misunderstanding of terms, they just use terms that aren't
01:12:05 correct in analyzing the thing they're looking at because they had an emotional reaction to it
01:12:10 that was negative. Yeah, I see a lot of that going around as well.
01:12:16 I've seen that with, I've seen a lot of bad animation takes in general and like when you
01:12:22 read the responses, people just, it's clear that they just really don't know much about animation
01:12:28 at all. I have a good example actually. I mean, you can't expect the layperson to know about
01:12:35 techniques, right? You can't expect them to know like the technical,
01:12:39 you can't expect the audience to know like the technical aspects of it.
01:12:43 All they should be expected to know is like how it impacts them, right?
01:12:48 Okay, so here's an example of one thing recently where someone's like,
01:12:54 I, because you know, High Guardian Spice, it's that show that everyone hates even though
01:12:59 I know it's just kind of mediocre, but you know how every time like something is like
01:13:06 not great, people have to freak the fuck out and call it, say it's a travesty and a disaster and
01:13:10 all this bullshit. Well, High Guardian Spice had all this other
01:13:16 reasons for that. People hate it for reasons that have little to do with like the quality of the
01:13:27 show itself. They just hated it in concept and in pop culture. It was because of,
01:13:35 it was because, not even for the thing itself, it was because it was like the fact that it was
01:13:40 crunchy roll and the fact that it called itself an anime despite looking obviously western and
01:13:45 the way that it marketed itself as like diverse, right? Like the thing about, they sold it on like
01:13:51 Oh yeah, I mean, the trailer had absolutely nothing to do with the show and everything.
01:13:55 It's categorically not an anime. It's made by a fucking western studio.
01:14:00 Right. Yeah, but that's the sort of thing I'm getting at is like the reasons people would go
01:14:07 and like talk about these things and try to dissect it on a technical level when they don't
01:14:13 know about the technicals. They're going into it trying to destroy it because of all these other
01:14:19 things that they're actually the things they care about. And so the thing I posted is someone's
01:14:24 being like, oh, look, I remade a scene and doesn't it look so much better? And it is just
01:14:29 worse. Like the animation is worse in every object by every objective measure. Yeah,
01:14:33 they just made the art style more anime-esque. Yeah, they've made the art style more anime,
01:14:39 but the movements are way worse. There's like, I've left a huge comment, like a huge breakdown,
01:14:46 like pointing out every single way in which it failed to be as well animated as the original.
01:14:53 You know what? There's one thing specific. I mean, I always hate bloom, but the bloom in the
01:14:59 remade version of this little scene here is a thing in anime that I've never liked ever.
01:15:05 And they turned it up to like fucking 12. Yeah. Why did they make the ground look white?
01:15:10 Digital anime always has bloom to make it look like it's actually real.
01:15:15 Yeah, I don't get it. This scene that they re-animate, it's literally like six frames.
01:15:20 I feel like you spent longer writing this comment than you spent drawing it.
01:15:24 He did. I mean, I spent two hours on writing that comment to be fair. I should never be allowed
01:15:31 to write anything because I'm so picky with my words. I like to think that the creators just
01:15:34 reply with, okay. That's what you would do, Eleazar. Well, apparently the creator thanked
01:15:38 people for like constructive feedback and I made sure my comment was constructive.
01:15:44 I like how I click on this video and the first comment I see is from a month ago.
01:15:51 The original VA is definitely not helping, but the animation is way better than the original
01:15:55 props to you. The animation is not better than the original. It is worse animated.
01:15:59 It is objectively worse. They complicated the image to the point where they had difficulty
01:16:03 animating it. It's so short, it's barely even animated. Yeah. Yeah, it manages to be worse
01:16:09 than the original, which is a pretty low bar because the original is nothing special.
01:16:13 Yeah. Hold on. The motion, the drawings are not consistent. Her ear like moves all over the place
01:16:18 like. Her hand is tiny, tiny little baby hand. Yeah, the hand is badly drawn. The hat changes
01:16:25 size. Her face like facial proportions change. Every frame it's moving. The easing on her arms
01:16:31 is nonsensical. I feel like this person just thinks that like the fact that they drew it more
01:16:38 anatomical is just like categorically better. Yeah. The fact that they made it less cartoony,
01:16:46 I guess. I don't know. Yeah, it's like the problem is that it looks like a Western art style and
01:16:50 that's why it's bad. It's like, no, the art style for high guardian spice is fine. It's not even bad,
01:16:55 in my opinion. It's just like kind of like. It's a cute cartoon. You might not like it,
01:17:00 but this is what peak performance looks like. I saw similar things when people are like,
01:17:05 what if Gravity Falls was an anime and then they draw like a scene that it's not even,
01:17:10 the style doesn't even look like anime. It's just some like kind of chippy deviant art version of
01:17:14 anime and all the comments are, wow, you're better than an entire studio, even though like the production
01:17:20 is like mostly just gradients and bloom filters and shit. It's easy to animate a single shot.
01:17:28 It's easy for like, yeah, one person can do that. Imagine doing like an entire season of a show.
01:17:34 It's almost like animation studios give shots to individual people and that's how a shock gets
01:17:40 done. Makes you think. And then these YouTubers come along and do like a version that from a
01:17:48 technical animation perspective is nowhere near as impressive or like clean or well done and uses
01:17:52 a whole bunch of shortcuts and filters and people just eat it up because they see a gradient or
01:17:58 they see an anime eye and they go, wow, and they clap like a seal. Yeah. Media literacy. Makes me
01:18:04 mad. This reminds me of on, on Saturday after in the pro and on server after watching Dog Day
01:18:12 Afternoon, we watched Raging Ball with my good friend SackDev. Like in the afternoon, I was
01:18:18 hanging out with a friend and I said, oh yeah, I watched Raging Ball. It's a, it's a movie that
01:18:22 despite being from the 80s, it's in black and white. My friend was like, ugh, I could never
01:18:26 watch a movie in black and white. So I'm like, you're awful. You're awful, Murray.
01:18:33 This is why we need to break into Zack's home. I'll remove his skeleton eyes and replace him
01:18:38 with skeleton eyes from the 80s. I can only see in black and white. That'll show him.
01:18:45 What is this, this ordinary creator, this, this, all right. So ordinary person is like,
01:18:51 hates their boss, but is too weak and shy to do anything about it. The creative person imagines
01:18:57 them as a witch and likes them. She's just gay. She's just gay. She's just gay. She's gay for her
01:19:05 evil boss. She's gay for her evil witch boss. She's insolent. Ordinary person hates being,
01:19:15 being chastised and abused by their, by their boss. Creative people get off on it a little bit.
01:19:21 It's true, it's true. What if my, what if my, what if my sexy boss were a green witch who hated me
01:19:31 just as much? He didn't drink coffee, but instead swept the floor. She's imagining that the boss
01:19:39 is going to sweep the floor for her. See, Tull, I just, just to say, I really like the, you know,
01:19:46 need, but I need to make him creative. She's just going to be really confused when the boss
01:19:55 like starts taking a swig from the broom. I like, I like the creative, creative people live in a world
01:20:02 where everything is reimagined as being part of intellectual properties that exist already.
01:20:09 Creative, creative people populate their, their, their, their inner fantasy worlds with the, the,
01:20:16 the inner life of a creative person is basically like Ready Player One, where it's just like, you
01:20:21 know, the Iron Giant and Wicked and, and Pokemon, Pokemon. The person, the person who made these
01:20:27 images definitely is a big Ready Player One fan. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Creative people are just
01:20:34 delusional. Delightfully devilish. Delightfully devilish. Delightfully devilish.
01:20:42 Yeah, yeah. Creative people imagine that their, their thing is on fire, but delightfully devilish
01:20:46 people actually have it on fire and it burns their, their roast and ruins it. Delight, to, to,
01:20:53 to ordinary, ordinary people see that the house is on fire. Creative people say it's just, it's
01:20:58 the Northern Lights at this time of year in this part of the country, located entirely inside your
01:21:04 kitchen. Ordinary people think they're hamburgers. Creative people steam hams.
01:21:15 I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up.
01:21:18 Like tell the steamed ham story on the PCP. Ordinary people throw up, Ben.
01:21:22 What? Yeah, Ben. I wish I was an ordinary person. Creative people drink tap water.
01:21:29 Oh, ruined. Ben's ruined.
01:21:34 Creative people drink, drink beer and never drink tap water. They'll never, they'll never
01:21:39 hydrate themselves. Ben, you know, being straight edge is more creative than, than consuming
01:21:45 substances nowadays. This lady, this lady with the, with the pink hair, is it pink? It's like
01:21:50 gray pink. This lady with the gray pink hair is, is, is straight edge. She is, she's straight edge.
01:21:57 Oblivion, she's high on creativity. Oblivion, what is that, steamed ham story?
01:22:03 Yeah. The steamed ham story. What is it? I know I told the story somewhere. I don't remember if it
01:22:07 was the draw cast or the PCP, but um, I don't remember hearing it. Oh God. All right. So I have
01:22:12 an interesting history with fucking English classes. With steamed ham. Throughout my entire life,
01:22:18 throughout my whole fucking life. The first, the first example when I was at this fucking
01:22:23 microscopic tiny school for Amoeba that had like four students after me and my sister joined.
01:22:28 It was the tiniest school you could ever imagine.
01:22:30 It wasn't a Christian school. That's my, that's my question.
01:22:33 It was a Christian school and it was in Mozgiel by Dunedin in the south of New Zealand.
01:22:39 If anyone lives in Mozgiel by Dunedin. If anyone lives in Mozgiel watching the PCP,
01:22:46 that's crazy because it's a fucking microscopic town with like no one in it.
01:22:49 Um, if one person there watches the PCP, they all do.
01:22:54 Well, we got a creative writing assignment and I had recently watched that episode of The Simpsons
01:22:59 with steamed hams and I thought it was so funny. You did tell the story. You did tell the story.
01:23:05 Oh yeah. Yeah. Didn't you just write, you just wrote it as your essay? You just wrote it as my
01:23:10 assignment and submitted it and I got failed. Yeah. And I didn't know what Aurora Borealis was
01:23:19 and I just made up the spelling in my head. No wonder you got it. So you called this your essay
01:23:24 when it was clearly steamed hams. Despite the fact there's obviously steamed hams.
01:23:31 That's funny. Well, there is a part two to this because later in high school I did some similar
01:23:36 bullshit in terms of just, except this time it succeeded. This time I worked out my favor.
01:23:41 So me, a little boy in high school with autism, we had to do speeches. We had to write a speech
01:23:49 and deliver speech and I was kind of nervous because public speaking, that's like scary. That's
01:23:55 like even scarier than just talking to a regular person. What the fuck? So my plan was just to
01:24:02 write this stupidest like speech imaginable and I was currently like obsessed with DarkDemon.org,
01:24:10 the Pivot Animation website and me and my friend had a bunch of inside jokes and so I just took
01:24:14 those jokes and I turned them into a story and I wrote a story about how there was a guy called
01:24:20 Damon who's just a guy from this animation website who created a time machine to go back in time
01:24:27 to create a bunch of free legged creatures that are like indestructible and wiped out
01:24:35 the dinosaurs and they're also immortal and they worshiped him because they consist of
01:24:41 free legs joined together and that's their entire anatomical structure.
01:24:45 This sounds like something out of pastel defender heliotrope.
01:24:50 Maybe. And they worshiped Damon. They thought he was a god because he has four limbs. Imagine
01:24:55 four limbs and they're religious symbol for him. In the land of the three legged, the four legged is
01:25:00 king, I guess. Yeah. And so their symbol for him was a swastika and that's where it came from
01:25:07 because four and these creatures live forever and they made all the decisions throughout history
01:25:14 and they created World War II and Hitler was actually one of these free legged creatures
01:25:18 after all and they covered it up and I told all this bullshit that I was just making up when I
01:25:24 was 15 and I delivered the speech and I got the highest marks in the entire class only because
01:25:32 I was enthusiastic and actually projected my voice instead of fucking mumbling.
01:25:36 Didn't even listen to what you were saying. Did they just edit in like Hitler's other arm
01:25:44 into all of his old pictures? Yeah, exactly. They had to turn one of the legs into a head
01:25:50 because these creatures don't have heads either. It's just like free legs connected and there's
01:25:55 no torso. Yeah, he's just three legs. He's just three legs in a trench coat.
01:26:05 Very strange. I'll be right back. I gotta go to the bathroom. I'll be back in a second.
01:26:10 Who did the rule on? Elias are other puking sounds and fart sounds and toilet sounds.
01:26:19 Fart with reverb specifically Elias are. Fart and fart with reverb. Puk with reverb.
01:26:25 Puk with reverb. That'd be like a cool archaeological find. Is the fart without reverb?
01:26:31 No. Without reverb. The original. This is like with a brush taking the dust out. Oh my god.
01:26:38 Is this just a fart? Is this fart without reverb? That's insane. I don't believe it. I don't believe
01:26:43 that's possible. I had to scroll so far down on that video to see your comment oblivion.
01:26:49 Did you even find it? Yeah, I found it. I was like, for a second I was like, wait, did they,
01:26:54 I kind of have this many comments. It's not a big video. Did they delete it? And then I found
01:26:59 it. I'm like, oh, they didn't delete it. Okay, that's nice. Yeah, I took the screenshot like
01:27:04 just earlier when I clicked on the video because it shows up for me, obviously,
01:27:07 because it's my comment. Yeah. So, for February. Yes. Yeah. Go check out Big Girl Squish on Twitter.
01:27:21 Dude, I like that one. We should definitely. I forget if it was Gun Girl or it was probably
01:27:27 Gun Girl. Just looking at the boobs. Gun Girl. That was a good one. That makes me feel inspired.
01:27:31 I'm like, I need to draw big again, but like even more like, like the boobs have to be like
01:27:36 disgustingly sexy. I gotta do it. It was really just like, I had drawn like a few images. I don't
01:27:44 know why, but I've always had trouble actually committing to drawing like, oh, this is like
01:27:52 sexually attractive woman. Obviously, like, I can do it sometimes, but it's like difficult,
01:27:59 or I try to mask it with like, oh, it's comedy. There's a joke. I'm not actually serious. Haha.
01:28:05 It's a, there can't be serious feelings here. It's just a comedy. That was your first mistake.
01:28:11 And so I'm like, I'm trying, I'm trying to like, to get over that because like, I know I have the
01:28:18 power. I have the power to draw good stuff that's like actually good. You know, and I spent a long
01:28:26 time on that drawing. You know, hiding behind irony and sarcasm and cynicism didn't help anyone,
01:28:32 especially Dr. House. But he had a whole TV show. He got a TV show deal. Oh, shit.
01:28:39 But yeah, that's, it like started as like, haha, wouldn't it be funny if, and then I'm,
01:28:44 I'm getting more like serious about like improving my drawings with each drawing.
01:28:51 Maybe too serious. Why so serious? It's just big boobies. It's, it's, it should be fun.
01:28:58 You want to know who I got these boobs?
01:29:02 Do you want to take estrogen every day?
01:29:07 Oh, it's an animation I made around the time I gave that speech.
01:29:11 Oh my god. Oh my god.
01:29:13 Hey, look at that little stick guy.
01:29:15 The little, yeah, it was, so it was like a meme to take a regular stick man,
01:29:19 delete his arms in his head and treat the torso as just a third leg and just animate them fighting.
01:29:24 Oh, I was going to say, I found this one.
01:29:28 One of them had four legs. It would be Nazis.
01:29:34 Yes, I love this image. It's so good.
01:29:37 I'm big. It's so, so big. Six foot nine, nine foot 11.
01:29:44 Oh, I see. She is not actually that tall, but the amount.
01:29:56 Felly is spooky for him that I haven't drawn yet is like nine foot 11 because of course it is.
01:30:03 Oh, big is only nine foot tall.
01:30:05 Damn.
01:30:08 Only, I say.
01:30:10 Yeah, only. What a shame.
01:30:12 She could be even bigger.
01:30:15 Make it bigger.
01:30:16 A regular Gib, regular Gib has Felly as a tits resting on her head in spirit.
01:30:24 Probably.
01:30:26 Huh? Regular Gib?
01:30:28 Gibbob.
01:30:29 What do you mean resting on?
01:30:31 Because you're not, you're not, you're not super tall.
01:30:33 Oh, no. Yeah. Oh, I get it. Yes.
01:30:36 Yes.
01:30:37 Notice, we've got to do the attack on Titan size comparison video,
01:30:41 but it's all like the big booby OCs from Twitter artists.
01:30:45 That would be kind of interesting.
01:30:49 That the thing with like huge women is that when you draw them in a white void,
01:30:54 you can't tell. There's no like, there's nothing to compare them to.
01:30:59 So like, if you really want to show off the size, it has to be in relation to something
01:31:05 either that a normal person will know what it is, like the average size smartphone.
01:31:10 If it's like smaller than their thumb, it's like, wow, that's a huge woman.
01:31:15 Or, or like, you know, trees or buildings or other people.
01:31:19 And the laziest is just to say, oh, this is how many, this is how high they are in a number.
01:31:26 But it works sometimes when there's like two people there.
01:31:29 But like, Fali is quite tall in this image and big is even taller,
01:31:36 but the average person is so much smaller.
01:31:40 Exactly.
01:31:41 I need, I need to, I need to draw one with them.
01:31:43 Oblivion, you need to remake show of the Colossals, but with Fali and all
01:31:48 fucking the giant woman you drew.
01:31:51 Funny, I could, but that would take a million years.
01:31:55 I've, in general, I've just been thinking of, of like improving it out.
01:32:02 And, and like, I was getting a little frustrated because I feel like when I try harder than
01:32:11 like not at all, if I, if I don't try at all, it's like a sketch.
01:32:14 It's like a very simple thing.
01:32:17 I don't go over it a second time and it's fine.
01:32:20 Maybe it's funny.
01:32:22 If I try a bit harder and I try to like, okay, let's do a sketch layer and then like
01:32:27 clear, clean it up with some line art, maybe color it, shade it.
01:32:32 If I try harder, it looks worse.
01:32:34 It's less interesting.
01:32:36 People don't care about it as much.
01:32:37 I don't care about it as much.
01:32:39 And yet I spent longer on it.
01:32:41 And then to do like a really good image.
01:32:44 I, it's not like spending large amounts of time is actually like necessarily
01:32:56 going to make it better, but it's more likely.
01:33:00 It's just, sometimes it sucks.
01:33:02 Sometimes it sucks when you work hard and then nobody cares about something you did.
01:33:08 I've been feeling, feeling a little bad about that recently.
01:33:11 I want these images, I want Febubri to be a success.
01:33:14 I want to make stuff that people are actually like pogging about.
01:33:17 I'm pogging.
01:33:19 I'm pogging.
01:33:19 Like for most of my favorite, like NSFW art is just like sketches or like uncolored things
01:33:27 that like they made in like a day, you know.
01:33:30 If you make these really gestural, like especially with porn, if you can get like the feel,
01:33:36 the visual feel of the squishy bits, right?
01:33:39 That's all people need.
01:33:41 Yeah.
01:33:42 And for that, you just have to learn the shortcuts for like,
01:33:45 like in your mind, you just have to like get it, get a knack for like,
01:33:49 which, what are the essential lines?
01:33:52 Like I can construct like a nicely shaped boob with just like free lines and it looks great.
01:33:58 And like figuring that out is what like gave me like confidence to like keep going.
01:34:03 And then I figured out, you know, fies and figured out other things.
01:34:06 And a lot of it, a lot of it helped.
01:34:08 A lot of the like progress I made came from just being on the draw cast
01:34:11 because I drew women all the time.
01:34:14 And because I have to be fast, like eventually, like I figured out,
01:34:16 oh, I can do a five, like using just two lines like this.
01:34:21 And then like, if I want to like add a more detail, I can, but I don't usually need to because
01:34:26 it's, you know, just a couple lines can be enough to convey like the shape well enough, you know.
01:34:32 This is how plan is still give. This is how plan is still give. This is how plan is still give.
01:34:37 Yes. We will still give.
01:34:40 It's time to back onto the draw cast more often.
01:34:44 I mean, I'd come on. I just, you're always doing something with other people.
01:34:49 Oh, shit. We'll just invite you more because we love having you.
01:34:52 Yeah, you're fine and cool.
01:34:55 Thanks.
01:34:57 All right. Look at this one. This one was the second day or third day.
01:35:02 Yeah, this one.
01:35:03 I was like, I tried really hard and I feel like I did a pretty good job.
01:35:09 But like, I don't know, people didn't really care about it.
01:35:14 And I don't, I think it was just sort of demoralizing because I spent so long
01:35:19 trying to get that looking right. And I look at it now and I'm like, yeah, so it's fine.
01:35:25 But there's just sort of like something about it that feels like,
01:35:29 not that it sucks. I'm not trying to say like, oh, woe is me. My art sucks. It's bad. It's just sort of,
01:35:36 I'm in an art moment. I'm having an art moment these past few days.
01:35:41 A creative people moment.
01:35:42 I don't know how to be good at what I'm doing. I'm just going to draw every day and
01:35:52 That's just how, that's just how you do.
01:35:54 I mean, the ultimate trick of porn that I have seen is don't try to have them or not.
01:36:03 Is this podcast still going?
01:36:05 I know, right?
01:36:05 Yes, Ben.
01:36:06 It's been 300 episodes.
01:36:08 300 episodes.
01:36:10 It's been 300 episodes. Give it, give it a rest already, guys.
01:36:13 Go drink some tap water, Ben, Jesus.
01:36:17 Is it a coincidence that you got the worst hangover on the 300 episodes of the PCP?
01:36:24 Yes.
01:36:28 He did on purpose.
01:36:30 I'm drinking Hannaford sparkling water beverage tropical punch flavor.
01:36:38 It's the best one.
01:36:39 It's got pineapple, kiwi, mango, raspberry.
01:36:48 No, I was drinking raspberry before, but I finished that.
01:36:55 Now I'm drinking tropical punch and tropical punch is yellow.
01:36:59 It's not.
01:37:00 I'll tropical punch you.
01:37:05 Don't do that, Gip. That's what he wants.
01:37:07 Violent. That's, I'll sue you.
01:37:11 Ben's a creative person. He likes it when people do that.
01:37:15 Ordinary people just get punched, you know, the bones broken.
01:37:19 Creative people.
01:37:22 I love being beaten.
01:37:25 I'll take them to court for this.
01:37:27 This is going to make me a rich man.
01:37:29 Mm. And also I have pink hair and wear hipster glasses.
01:37:35 Nice boob drawing.
01:37:36 Yeah.
01:37:37 I'm sick.
01:37:38 Thanks.
01:37:39 You're sick.
01:37:39 Fuck.
01:37:40 I like this situation.
01:37:42 I've been, I don't know.
01:37:44 These boobs look great.
01:37:45 These are great boobs.
01:37:47 Yeah.
01:37:47 Okay.
01:37:48 Gip, back to my tips on porn art that I see that people like.
01:37:51 Don't try too hard on the line art, because no one cares about that.
01:37:54 That's true.
01:37:54 Make the skin shiny.
01:37:56 True.
01:37:56 Because everyone loves that.
01:37:57 That's just true in general.
01:37:58 That's just true in general.
01:37:59 Yeah.
01:38:00 Yeah.
01:38:00 I was looking at Clip Studio Paint.
01:38:03 I don't think any of the brushes are brushes I like using except the marker,
01:38:07 which is like a, doesn't taper.
01:38:10 And it's just sort of like a, a fixed size and it's very thin.
01:38:14 Could you make a custom brush that's like got the same texture as the marker,
01:38:17 but also has like the kind of taper that you like?
01:38:22 I, uh, I was looking around.
01:38:24 Like maybe we'll just need to look at a tutorial.
01:38:26 Oh, you can just edit.
01:38:27 You can just edit the brush size.
01:38:29 If you, next to the brush size is a little like, like button.
01:38:33 And if you click on it, you can.
01:38:34 I pressed around with some of the buttons.
01:38:35 They didn't seem to like actually do anything.
01:38:38 Okay.
01:38:40 Oh, yeah.
01:38:41 Also.
01:38:42 I saw that Ben.
01:38:43 Also the important thing.
01:38:44 Did someone post this already?
01:38:46 Oh, I don't know if it was posted in this chat.
01:38:47 This one, this one's a winner.
01:38:49 This one's a real winner.
01:38:50 Oh my God.
01:38:52 People do love to be racist.
01:38:54 I just, I just saw the Godzilla dunking
01:38:57 the basketball.
01:38:59 That does remind me of something to bring up.
01:39:01 I love that image so much.
01:39:02 Yeah.
01:39:02 Yeah.
01:39:03 Well, I'm just posting.
01:39:04 Yeah, man.
01:39:04 How big is that fucking basketball?
01:39:07 Oh yeah, Godzilla.
01:39:08 Yeah, that's, that's too big.
01:39:09 Godzilla got busy.
01:39:12 Um, I don't know.
01:39:13 Godzilla's a little bit is even darker
01:39:16 than the man in that image.
01:39:20 That's why he's so good at basketball.
01:39:24 Ben's words, not mine.
01:39:26 Keener.
01:39:28 Disavow.
01:39:28 I mean, he's got night, he's wearing nikes.
01:39:31 As we know, creative people love to be racist.
01:39:34 It's true.
01:39:35 It's true.
01:39:36 You're, as those two images together,
01:39:38 the, the pro, the procrastinators podcast,
01:39:41 300 episodes of creative people being racist.
01:39:45 Loving it.
01:39:47 Here's the 300 more.
01:39:48 Yeah.
01:39:49 Yeah.
01:39:52 Speaking of racism towards.
01:39:54 Oh no.
01:39:56 That group of people.
01:39:57 You're so slur, I can't remember.
01:39:59 No, I've been, I've been workshopping it.
01:40:03 Have you guys been hearing about
01:40:04 the Canadian trucker protests?
01:40:06 That's stupid.
01:40:07 Yeah.
01:40:07 I have heard a few things about it now.
01:40:10 It's like super co-opted by alt-right fascist type.
01:40:13 I heard the Simpsons predicted it,
01:40:15 but I also heard that the Simpsons didn't predict it.
01:40:18 Simpsons successfully predict and don't predict everything
01:40:22 because they've just done everything.
01:40:23 So what is it?
01:40:24 Because I don't know what's going on.
01:40:25 All right.
01:40:25 So, you know, vaccine, I, I, I, I don't know.
01:40:30 Vaccine's bad.
01:40:32 Vaccine's bad.
01:40:33 Trucker's not real.
01:40:34 That's why Ben hasn't gotten this.
01:40:36 That's why Ben hasn't gotten this.
01:40:37 Trucker's driving back and forth across the Canadian
01:40:39 and a U.S. border or other places,
01:40:42 wanting them to be vaccinated
01:40:43 because they drive around a lot
01:40:45 and they could potentially spread things.
01:40:46 Uh, clearly, uh, dumb.
01:40:48 Oh, why would you want them to be vaccinated?
01:40:50 So they're just blocking a bunch of like major roads,
01:40:53 blurring the horns day and night.
01:40:55 No one can sleep in those areas.
01:40:58 Um, I got, I got messaged by a Canadian
01:41:01 who like lives near of a protest
01:41:03 and is like being annoyed by it.
01:41:05 And then, yeah, it was co-opted by right-wing people.
01:41:09 There's been people spotted with, uh, like Nazi flags,
01:41:13 harassing people in homeless shelters,
01:41:15 taking food from homeless shelters and shit.
01:41:17 These truckers like, what the fuck?
01:41:19 Why?
01:41:19 Um, and just generally being terrible and inusense
01:41:22 and the police are just kind of letting
01:41:24 shit slide.
01:41:25 They don't give a fuck.
01:41:26 Um, which sucks.
01:41:27 They really need the mongrel mob down there
01:41:30 to straighten things out just like they did in New Zealand.
01:41:32 Hell yeah.
01:41:33 But you know what?
01:41:34 There is one group of people
01:41:35 who are rising up against the truckers.
01:41:37 I got contacted by one of them
01:41:40 who sent me this little video
01:41:42 that I'm putting in chat.
01:41:43 Oh my God, Garfield.
01:41:44 Garfield?
01:41:44 Um, look, look at that video I just dropped.
01:41:48 Yeah.
01:41:48 Um, that's a counter-protester.
01:41:52 Welcome to ComeZone.
01:41:54 Yo.
01:41:55 Yeah.
01:41:55 Yo.
01:41:56 Yo.
01:41:56 Yo.
01:41:57 Wait.
01:41:58 Hello.
01:41:58 Is that on the news?
01:42:01 All right.
01:42:02 So what you're watching is not the news.
01:42:03 It's some kind of like pro-trucker,
01:42:05 like a live stream event.
01:42:07 Right.
01:42:07 Um, apparently there's a bunch of us going around
01:42:09 and they're letting people call in to give their support
01:42:12 and then a whole bunch of people are calling in
01:42:14 and just playing welcome to the ComeZone on full blast
01:42:17 to fuck them over.
01:42:19 That's hilarious.
01:42:21 And it's great.
01:42:21 I support them.
01:42:23 Like you have my official blessing.
01:42:24 Fuck these truckers.
01:42:25 They suck.
01:42:26 That's pretty lit.
01:42:27 These truckers are fuckers.
01:42:29 These are mothered.
01:42:31 Actually, they don't have moms.
01:42:32 They got nothing.
01:42:33 They should, uh, what did I see?
01:42:35 I saw, I saw, uh, Don.
01:42:39 It's not one Twitter account.
01:42:40 I saw Don something said like,
01:42:44 we need to, we need to confiscate these truckers' trucks
01:42:47 and like donate the proceeds to vaccine research.
01:42:50 So that we can, so that finally the vaccines
01:42:53 will have less side effects.
01:42:55 And then everyone will be happy.
01:42:57 I don't know.
01:42:59 Get those trucks, crush them into tiny little cubes
01:43:02 and, and, and put that into vaccines.
01:43:07 Squish it into, like, ring it out and take all the vaccines.
01:43:09 If they didn't want, and then when you get injected,
01:43:12 you'll become Optimus Prime.
01:43:15 If they didn't want people to protest.
01:43:16 If you get injected, you'll become a trucker.
01:43:17 If they didn't want people to protest the vaccines,
01:43:20 they shouldn't have put 5G in them.
01:43:22 Well, I'm sorry.
01:43:24 I don't know what they were expecting.
01:43:25 Oh, a friend that believes in all of that.
01:43:28 They shouldn't have, they shouldn't have.
01:43:30 Age people.
01:43:31 That is, that is what age people look like.
01:43:39 I mean, they're right.
01:43:39 It's true.
01:43:40 It's just a fact.
01:43:41 I love those gifts so much.
01:43:43 It's great.
01:43:44 These people.
01:43:46 Are they from, are they from like a Dr. Seuss
01:43:48 interactive video game?
01:43:50 These are from, I don't know, there's a little clip art.
01:43:54 They're from something.
01:43:55 See, this is, they're probably from some, like, software.
01:43:57 It's like, it's just like a reader rabbit bullshit.
01:44:00 This is like a really good example of the frame rate being good.
01:44:04 Yeah.
01:44:05 More frames would not improve this at all.
01:44:07 Sator the Barricade, son.
01:44:11 Quick, someone take, someone take those little gifts and make them,
01:44:14 uh, I'm having frames per second.
01:44:17 Yeah, yeah, interpolate, AI interpolation.
01:44:23 Disgusting.
01:44:25 I like that little tappy feet.
01:44:26 I love this.
01:44:27 Like shifting around their weight.
01:44:29 Well, let me see if I can do it.
01:44:31 The more it, there's actually like more frames than you would think on this,
01:44:35 this P, like his foot, his foot goes through like a dozen different positions.
01:44:39 I know, right?
01:44:42 Damn.
01:44:42 They put more effort into it than they probably need.
01:44:44 P for effort.
01:44:46 Yeah.
01:44:47 That's a P for effort.
01:44:48 And it's still like five frames a second pathetic.
01:44:52 I can't, I can't get off to this.
01:44:53 I need it to be smooth.
01:44:54 That's me.
01:44:55 I need it to be smooth.
01:44:56 G-I-B-E.
01:44:58 Every time I'm on rule 34 and I see like,
01:45:00 Oh, this thing's an animation and I click on it and then I see that it's like interpolated
01:45:04 and these just just disgusting, like blurry, like smeared frames,
01:45:07 like every other second, I just want to vomit.
01:45:10 Yeah.
01:45:11 How dare they.
01:45:11 I knew people were going to do that to my animations eventually too.
01:45:14 That's why I'm going to do it for them.
01:45:15 I just want to vomit, but instead I come.
01:45:16 I can do it right.
01:45:20 That's very flippin' cool.
01:45:22 It is.
01:45:23 Yeah, that is for you.
01:45:24 The animation smearing like high frame rate stuff is like,
01:45:29 it's like a, it's like a way to like fuck with the video in the same way that like,
01:45:35 what is it called when like a video file holds on a frame while it seems to be moving in the
01:45:41 background?
01:45:42 No, you're like a P frame that's called data mashing.
01:45:45 Data mashing.
01:45:46 You could use that as like a data mashing-esque fuckery thing to make something deliberately
01:45:53 look weird.
01:45:53 Okay, I saw, I saw a tweet fairly recently that was about like, it was, it was like,
01:46:04 you know, it was like soyjack versus Chad, but the soyjack was all like warped and looked shitty
01:46:09 and it was like, don't use like 3D model, don't like trace 3D models for your drawings.
01:46:14 And the other one was like, a well-constructed anatomical drawing of a head and it was like,
01:46:20 uses 3D models for their drawing.
01:46:23 And it really annoyed me.
01:46:24 Did you, did you see this?
01:46:26 I think I've seen that.
01:46:27 I don't think I've seen it.
01:46:29 Can you find it?
01:46:30 Yeah, uh, yeah.
01:46:32 It's, it's just sort of like, don't, don't, uh, trace 3D models and the one on the right.
01:46:38 It's like tracing a 3D model with the yes face things like I did anyway.
01:46:42 The implication is like, if you don't use, if you don't trace a 3D model and your drawing
01:46:47 will just be bad and you can't, you can't draw without it.
01:46:51 I think the implication more in a, in a, in a meme format like that is that, um,
01:46:57 you say that these are the rules, but I'm breaking them and it's fine.
01:47:01 I'm okay with it.
01:47:01 It's not that it's bad to not use 3D models, but that it's fine to use 3D models.
01:47:07 Yeah, like there's probably like people who will like, oh, using 3D models is cheating
01:47:12 and it's like, it's just a fucking tool like anything else.
01:47:15 Go for it.
01:47:16 Yeah, I'm, I'm fine with that.
01:47:18 Like I don't mind, I don't begrudge anyone their, their method or whatever.
01:47:23 But I do think that like, I don't know.
01:47:25 I think it was annoyed by the tone to be like, I've, I've, okay.
01:47:31 Intended or not.
01:47:32 Ben, Ben saw the meme and he's like, this is about me.
01:47:35 Intended or not.
01:47:37 I feel like the implication is like, your drawings are worse for not doing this.
01:47:43 And I was like, no, it's not.
01:47:45 Ben, you are the big artist, not retweeting little artists.
01:47:49 Why would you be proud?
01:47:50 Why, why would you be proud that you can't draw without using a 3D, without tracing a 3D reference?
01:47:57 And then I, okay, I, I, then I went and I saw this person's art and like,
01:48:01 they, their, their art is like, they do like headshots.
01:48:04 They do like close up headshots of, of characters and like, you know, all they do,
01:48:09 they use like a big anime head shape, just, just the basic head, no features or anything,
01:48:14 just the shape of the head and the neck and the shoulders.
01:48:17 And it's like, why not simply learn how to draw a circle?
01:48:22 Like that's it.
01:48:22 Like it's just a circle with a chin.
01:48:25 Like there's, they, they barely even, they, I don't even see what they need the model for.
01:48:29 It was a, it was so, these are, these are experts, experts.
01:48:35 I mean, it's, it's, it's, I mean, they're, they're fine.
01:48:38 Like their, their stuff is good and fine and, and, and, and all right.
01:48:42 I just, I don't even see, I don't even see the point.
01:48:45 Let me see the point of, uh, I'm trying, I'm scrolling through their feed right now,
01:48:50 trying to find like, I'm assuming that it just helps remove guesswork early on,
01:48:54 so they can get into the groove faster.
01:48:56 Here, here.
01:48:56 That's probably like the main purpose.
01:48:58 Their, their work definitely has like a bit of a, like, you can tell quite clearly that
01:49:04 they're using a very similar skull for all these heads.
01:49:07 Yeah. Here, here, watch it.
01:49:08 Watch this video.
01:49:09 It shows them starting from the model and it's like, all you would need to do is just
01:49:14 learn how to draw that shi, that head shape, right?
01:49:17 And if you knew how to draw that shape, you wouldn't even, you wouldn't even need the model anymore.
01:49:22 Honestly, I agree.
01:49:23 Like I feel like the model is really like not even necessary for this.
01:49:27 I really, I really, yeah.
01:49:28 I don't even think it's, like, the purpose of a model is like to help with like a complex pose
01:49:33 or if it's like a lot of foreshortening and like, you know, like a wide angle lens sort of thing.
01:49:37 A complex pose, like, like, like a, a, I don't know, a baseball guy, like in mid-throw,
01:49:42 it's like, well, what, what does that pose look like?
01:49:43 Use a, use a reference, trace a reference to get the pose right.
01:49:47 Because it's complicated.
01:49:48 This is not, this is not complicated.
01:49:51 You know?
01:49:53 It's always good.
01:49:53 So it seems like, like, not the time to use it.
01:49:56 Like, I feel like that's like, this is like the easy stuff.
01:50:00 They're getting a bit of same face going on.
01:50:02 Yeah.
01:50:02 Because of it, I feel like.
01:50:04 Yeah.
01:50:04 Maybe about two.
01:50:05 A bit.
01:50:06 The, the, the, the inaccuracy of human beings is what all art is based on.
01:50:12 If it could be made by computers perfectly accurately,
01:50:15 then what the hell is the point of us doing it?
01:50:18 Yeah.
01:50:18 Like, like the, no, that this is exactly that, but that's just sort of the feeling.
01:50:22 Like these look fine, I guess.
01:50:25 I just, I just, they look good.
01:50:26 I just didn't like the, I didn't like the, the like, well, I can do this because I,
01:50:31 I can do this because I use a 3D model.
01:50:33 It's like, you can do what?
01:50:34 You can, you can do what exactly?
01:50:37 Leave me alone.
01:50:38 Stop bullying me.
01:50:39 Stop bullying me for not being like.
01:50:41 Ben, you know, full well, they're just mad at,
01:50:43 like they're just responding to like certain like annoying people
01:50:46 and their comments or some shit.
01:50:48 Yeah.
01:50:48 And making fun of them, not you.
01:50:50 I know it's, it's, yeah, it's about, it's about something.
01:50:54 It's about some context that I'm like not privy to.
01:50:59 You're right.
01:51:01 Someone says like, oh, that's not real art.
01:51:03 That's not real art if you use a model.
01:51:06 Yeah.
01:51:07 And they're right.
01:51:08 There are people like that.
01:51:08 And they're right.
01:51:11 Oh, so that it is about you.
01:51:13 If you use a computer, if you use a computer, it's not a drawing.
01:51:18 There's this channel.
01:51:19 In my opinion.
01:51:20 There's this channel on, um, it's from.
01:51:24 Ben admits that he's not an artist.
01:51:25 Finally.
01:51:25 It's from Spain.
01:51:27 And he's like, he only like criticizes artists and says like,
01:51:30 oh yeah, Bob Ross is not a real artist because he just knows how to paint landscapes.
01:51:34 I don't know how to do portrait.
01:51:36 He's like, fuck you.
01:51:37 Fuck off.
01:51:38 When has Bob Ross ever drawn like a huge milky kid?
01:51:41 What did I see?
01:51:42 You know what?
01:51:43 I saw some, I saw some video of a guy, some crypto shell being like,
01:51:49 yo, NFT is the future.
01:51:51 And then he has like a little interview with another guy.
01:51:53 And the other guy is like, finally, you know, like, finally, you know,
01:51:57 creators are now empowered.
01:51:59 Creators will finally start creating digital artwork.
01:52:11 Yeah.
01:52:14 And then he qualified it with like, and then he qualified it with like,
01:52:17 I mean, I mean, like, you know, like master artists, like, like real, like real artists.
01:52:24 I guess the implication is like, sure, like shitty, like shitty artists use,
01:52:28 would make digital artists.
01:52:29 But now, now that NFTs are a thing, real artists will make digital artwork.
01:52:34 And this is, and this is going to be a game changer.
01:52:38 The Epes will just steal the Mona Lisa and sell it online.
01:52:43 There's a weird sect of like, tech enthusiastic people who are,
01:52:47 I could only imagine, like, learned about the, the email was a thing like last year.
01:52:55 Like they're so stupid.
01:52:57 They're so out of the loop on everything.
01:52:59 They're like fine, they're like fine.
01:53:00 People who like see the metaverse and like, whoa, you can be online?
01:53:04 Like, yeah.
01:53:04 Yeah.
01:53:04 Like these people have never watched serial experiments lane,
01:53:07 which warned us about the metaverse.
01:53:08 And you don't see me to understand.
01:53:11 Understand.
01:53:12 I think it's like, it's like finance people that are like,
01:53:26 account that are like career accountants.
01:53:29 You like, these people are big nerds.
01:53:30 You would think they'd be online, but they're not that kind of nerd.
01:53:33 They're like some weirdos.
01:53:35 They have, they have the real picture on their LinkedIn of the photograph of a,
01:53:41 like a professional photography and they smiling.
01:53:43 Not anymore.
01:53:44 And now they got an eight.
01:53:45 Then they're like, now they've got an eight because it's the future.
01:53:48 Because it's worth it.
01:53:49 We don't need to look like human beings.
01:53:51 Because it's worth.
01:53:51 We can have digital computers.
01:53:53 Computers can make art.
01:53:54 I thought they were just used to like, look at the stocks numbers really fast.
01:53:57 Okay.
01:53:58 So I just Google Garfield NFTs and I made an amazing discovery.
01:54:04 It's like, oh God.
01:54:05 Is it Garfield Eats?
01:54:07 No, no, no, no.
01:54:08 There's these like cards.
01:54:10 They're just different kinds of Garfield.
01:54:13 Why is it so small?
01:54:14 Why, why so small?
01:54:19 Who's, who's, is this like an actual NFT thing?
01:54:23 I don't know.
01:54:23 It just found it on Google.
01:54:26 That is pretty funny.
01:54:27 Some, somebody's, somebody's, somebody's been inspired.
01:54:31 Bonefield.
01:54:34 It's funny unless it's real.
01:54:36 This is better than every other fucking NFT collection I've ever seen, TBH.
01:54:39 If it is an NFT, it might not even be an NFT.
01:54:42 It might not just be someone making like horror Garfields.
01:54:46 I would have to assume someone just stole someone else's art and put like a border around it.
01:54:51 I mean, it's all the same stuff.
01:54:52 If this, if this is what NFTs are like, then I guess I'll,
01:54:56 maybe I should jump in.
01:54:57 Maybe I should.
01:54:58 Okay.
01:54:59 These are from a post on Reddit from r slash.
01:55:01 I'm sorry, John.
01:55:02 Oh God.
01:55:03 And the title is Garfield Cards.
01:55:05 Please no NFT talk in the comments.
01:55:07 I'm really tired of hearing it.
01:55:11 Sorry, guys.
01:55:12 No wonder the art's good.
01:55:14 It's not an NFT.
01:55:15 That's funny.
01:55:17 Oh, did you guys know that like the eight,
01:55:19 I'm pretty sure the eight person was a commissioned artist.
01:55:21 He wasn't told what the art was for.
01:55:23 And so.
01:55:24 Really?
01:55:25 Yeah, but I think I heard that.
01:55:27 I'm not sure.
01:55:27 I saw a picture of her.
01:55:30 Yeah.
01:55:30 She's like a sexy lady.
01:55:34 Yeah.
01:55:34 How dare she?
01:55:35 How dare she be sexy at all?
01:55:37 It's a problem for me that she looks the way she does.
01:55:41 I don't like it.
01:55:42 I agree.
01:55:43 I guess what you're talking about.
01:55:46 The NFT lady, the one who's supposed to be the monkeys.
01:55:50 Oh.
01:55:50 The apes.
01:55:50 Yeah, she's just a person.
01:55:51 She's a pretty lady.
01:55:53 Yeah.
01:55:53 But I just, that's the thing I heard.
01:55:54 I'm not sure if that's true, but it's true.
01:55:56 No, she's ugly on the inside because of the NFTs.
01:55:58 I don't think, okay, but I guess she, I mean, I don't know.
01:56:01 Did she not know what the apes were going to be used for?
01:56:04 She was just someone that someone hired?
01:56:07 Yes, from what I heard, from what I heard, she was commissioned to draw the NFTs
01:56:17 without being told.
01:56:19 But they're, okay, okay, but they're, but they're not drawn, right?
01:56:22 They're like assembled from, you know, the template.
01:56:26 Yeah, they're randomized.
01:56:28 I mean, she had, she drew the assets, obviously.
01:56:31 Yeah.
01:56:32 Yeah.
01:56:33 Well, I mean, I guess, I guess it makes sense.
01:56:37 I mean, before they, before they blew up, like how would you even know?
01:56:41 Even if someone told you what they were, you'd be like, okay.
01:56:45 Oh yeah, no, she didn't.
01:56:46 Did she see like any of the fucking millions of dollars?
01:56:49 This was back in the beginning when NFTs were first.
01:56:52 So I found, I looked up, I literally just looked up NFT lady, monkey lady.
01:56:58 And it's like, NFT lady, monkey lady.
01:57:03 I feel, I feel extremely sure that they, she does not see any like profit sharing from the
01:57:09 Yeah.
01:57:09 She created the artwork after connecting with a creative, creative agent,
01:57:13 Doug Nicole Munds, who came across her portfolio.
01:57:18 And they basically, like, this is like, they, they had to like draw these assets.
01:57:26 They just, they just wanted an ape that's like kind of jaded inside of life,
01:57:29 but has all the money and time in the world and hangs out in a mental bar, in a metal bar,
01:57:33 apparently, that was their instructions.
01:57:35 And hangs out in a metal bar?
01:57:38 Yeah.
01:57:39 She was the lead artist behind the original collection.
01:57:42 Whereas other artists took care of the ape traits and environments,
01:57:45 put a whimsical settings, the base structure and the character ape was all her thing.
01:57:50 She expressed sadness that despite the popularity of the multimillion dollar ape,
01:57:54 not many people know that she's made them.
01:57:57 And yeah, she didn't even, she didn't even get, um,
01:58:01 Yeah.
01:58:02 Yeah.
01:58:02 She didn't even get credit.
01:58:03 I'm sad, but I'm not being harassed by all the people who rightfully hate NFTs.
01:58:07 No, no, no.
01:58:07 However, however, comma, she's dropped her debut NFT series under her own name.
01:58:12 I bet she was paid like a few, I bet she was paid like a few thousand dollars.
01:58:16 Yeah.
01:58:17 Yeah.
01:58:18 She's got her own NFT.
01:58:19 She's, she's not, she's not good.
01:58:21 She's got her own NFT.
01:58:22 She dropped her own NFT series.
01:58:23 Yeah.
01:58:24 Okay.
01:58:24 Okay.
01:58:25 She deserves to miss out then.
01:58:26 Of course she does.
01:58:28 I mean, I think she deserves to miss out because I think people should be paid
01:58:31 for the labor that they, that you know, that they do.
01:58:34 However, comma, I think that she shouldn't, communism.
01:58:40 You know, you know, you know, Seatull, your principles, I agree with them.
01:58:43 Wait, people should get paid for their work.
01:58:47 What?
01:58:48 What have I been doing hating the PCB all these years?
01:58:51 It was where this is your exposure.
01:58:59 We're finally showing you.
01:59:01 This is it.
01:59:01 You've been building up credit for the, for, for two years now.
01:59:05 And now you're finally catching it in.
01:59:08 Yes.
01:59:11 Finally after 70 years.
01:59:12 A Stereos coconut liked my, liked my tweet.
01:59:16 Not, not even a good tweet.
01:59:17 Not even a, not even a funny tweet, not a popular tweet.
01:59:21 This tweet got like four likes.
01:59:23 Sorry.
01:59:24 Seven.
01:59:24 One of them was him.
01:59:25 It was, it was one of them was him.
01:59:27 It's just a reply.
01:59:28 It's just a reply to someone posting about the, uh, oh God, what's,
01:59:32 fuck, what's her name?
01:59:34 The, the lady, Mallory, Mallory Eudicious.
01:59:38 Oh, the, the lady who made the comic with shoplifting new guy.
01:59:43 I just, I just, I just made an angry reply to someone posted about the,
01:59:47 the, the, the shoplifting comic.
01:59:49 And I just made a reply.
01:59:50 It's being like, I hate, I hate people that are mad about this.
01:59:54 No, no joke.
01:59:55 No, nothing, nothing, but, but, but, uh, a Stereo saw it and was like, I agree.
02:00:00 I also hate these people.
02:00:03 Me and, me and, me and the, me and a Stereos were, we're like peas in a pot.
02:00:08 I gotta say, in all my years of hating PCP, the worst, the, the, the most hardest
02:00:16 to edit was the, the Wonderbird guy.
02:00:19 It was just so annoying.
02:00:22 Oh yeah.
02:00:23 He just sounds like an insane person.
02:00:25 He sucks so much.
02:00:26 He's so boring.
02:00:27 He's so boring.
02:00:30 It just the entire time it sounded like he was just like on the verge of like
02:00:34 snapping and like screaming.
02:00:37 He just sounded like he was just like on edge, like an angry.
02:00:40 I didn't understand.
02:00:41 That guy is neither wonderful nor weird.
02:00:44 He had.
02:00:45 I don't know.
02:00:47 He had a way of speaking like he was always on the verge of getting to the point.
02:00:52 I don't know.
02:00:52 He's like he constantly sounds like he's about, he's about to get to the point
02:00:56 and say something important, but he never does.
02:01:02 It's not real.
02:01:03 The point doesn't exist.
02:01:05 Hey, we've been going for like a couple of hours.
02:01:07 Do you want to get a voice mask or anything?
02:01:09 What are you, what are you, what are you in a hurry or something?
02:01:13 I have, look, it's not like I vaguely, I vaguely remember Eleazar complaining every
02:01:20 single time these, these podcasts.
02:01:22 Eleazar has to put all of these Garfield images in the episode.
02:01:25 So much editing Eleazar.
02:01:26 Now we'll see.
02:01:27 So this is the 300 episode.
02:01:29 This is 300.
02:01:32 Yeah, do we have 300?
02:01:34 All right.
02:01:35 I have some, I have, I have another topic.
02:01:37 I said the AI thing was a two pronged topic.
02:01:39 Here's part two.
02:01:40 AI voice generation.
02:01:41 Someone called in the last PCP after I left because I listened to it.
02:01:46 They had a Nate AI voice.
02:01:48 They have a bunch of them.
02:01:49 They made a Dr. Wolf one.
02:01:51 They've done all the ponies.
02:01:53 I want to know who that person is because let me tell you, when I edited the PCP,
02:01:58 you know, I eventually went back and deleted all the files because they were taking up
02:02:02 literally like 150 gigabytes or like a terabyte on my computer or some shit.
02:02:07 Yeah.
02:02:07 But I kept all of Nate's audio that I had cleaned up because expressly for the purpose
02:02:12 of an AI, if you want 10 hours of crisp, clean, Nate audio and wave format that is completely
02:02:19 unfettered by like YouTube compression and there's no one else talking.
02:02:23 It's just Nate by himself.
02:02:25 I can give you like 10 hours worth of training data and you can make that AI sound really good.
02:02:29 Oh no.
02:02:31 I will give it to you and then we will really have Nate returns on the PCP title will be correct.
02:02:37 The perfect Nate.
02:02:38 I don't know if I have to ask you to like
02:02:40 We can build a new Nate.
02:02:42 The voices.
02:02:42 A better Nate.
02:02:43 Maybe a voicemail is where she fucks Nate.
02:02:45 You can build a new Nate.
02:02:49 This Nate will give spew communist propaganda.
02:02:53 I see you always manage to.
02:02:54 I bet a foster should know how to have a weird socialism.
02:03:00 Weird socialism.
02:03:02 I just think that I just think that communism is like weirdly utilitarian.
02:03:05 I don't know why he doesn't see it.
02:03:06 Oh, Nate had a Nate had a Oki on the on the last.
02:03:15 What's what's it called?
02:03:17 Gamer zone.
02:03:17 So I like I like I like Oki.
02:03:21 Me and Oki have talked on Twitter a little bit.
02:03:23 Oki's good.
02:03:25 I forget that Nate still makes content.
02:03:28 He just makes the gamer zone.
02:03:31 It's like content but with funny people who aren't tricksy.
02:03:35 This is this is not really a I can't it's not Nate's.
02:03:39 This isn't Nate's fault exactly.
02:03:41 But it's funny that like people on Kiwi Farms like love Nate.
02:03:46 Like Kiwi Farms people when they talk about the PCP.
02:03:49 There was one post recently that was really funny because it was like
02:03:54 just like he didn't even go into specifics.
02:03:56 He just was like, man, it's funny.
02:03:58 It's funny just how far all the PCP all the PCP have just fallen into complete
02:04:03 ruin and disrepair and disreputability.
02:04:06 And except Nate, except Nate, obviously, like Nate's Nate has
02:04:10 Nate has obviously been fine and and kept his his head out of the muck or whatever.
02:04:16 And I just don't know how you can how you can read that.
02:04:19 I don't know how that's your reading of the situation that he's like Nate hasn't
02:04:22 been putting out content really like regularly for like two years.
02:04:27 How can you have a sense going full since going full time is output is dropped.
02:04:31 Yeah, I mean, that's what Sean's constantly shitting on him,
02:04:35 which is why I don't understand why Michelle thought he was going to spicy salt her.
02:04:40 Um, yeah, I don't know.
02:04:45 Sorry, spicy salts Nate, not spicy salt her.
02:04:47 She was afraid that would be stolen by well to spicy salts.
02:04:52 Well, I mean, the the analog would be if you spicy salted Nate,
02:04:58 that would mean you tried to kidnap Michelle, right?
02:05:01 Oh, I thought if you spicy.
02:05:02 Okay, then you did just spicy salt.
02:05:04 Someone is to attempt to kidnap their wife.
02:05:08 Okay, but it would never show.
02:05:10 I was trying to spicy salt Michelle wouldn't he be trying to kid that.
02:05:13 Well, Trixie also didn't get married.
02:05:15 Never.
02:05:15 Nevertheless, she called.
02:05:16 She said she said she said wife.
02:05:19 Same as she said, like she bought a house when she merely rented it.
02:05:25 This comes this comes up occasionally.
02:05:28 Crack, crack occasionally complains that and he's right to do so that like,
02:05:33 Trixie would just use the wrong word.
02:05:34 She would just describe things wrong in a way that is basically lying,
02:05:38 but like in a way that you're like, I don't know if if she knows that she's wrong
02:05:43 or if she's just dumb and doesn't understand that these things are different.
02:05:46 Things like renting a house versus buying a house.
02:05:48 She said she bought bought a house when she rented one.
02:05:50 They're like, they're not the same.
02:05:51 And like, I genuinely don't know if she knows these two things are different.
02:05:56 Calling May her wife when she was a young saying, you know, that's not that's a little
02:06:00 less of a thing.
02:06:01 I guess, I guess.
02:06:02 Did you know, you know, this this is funny.
02:06:06 May messaged me the other day or a few weeks ago.
02:06:09 Oh my God.
02:06:10 She meant she meant.
02:06:12 Okay, I call I call me.
02:06:14 I openly call May a Nazi on Twitter.
02:06:16 Like I add her and I say like, fuck you, Nazi.
02:06:19 Die.
02:06:19 Right.
02:06:20 Like I say stuff like I say stuff like that to her and I mean it.
02:06:23 And I absolutely mean it.
02:06:24 And it's not a joke.
02:06:26 And then she but she sees me like post mean things about Trixie.
02:06:30 And then she messaged me to be like, Ben, I appreciate you so much.
02:06:33 Like, I like this made my day, Ben.
02:06:35 I love that I'm like, she doesn't have any standards.
02:06:39 Yeah, she doesn't have any like a true Nazi.
02:06:41 She doesn't have any standards.
02:06:43 She's not even like offended.
02:06:44 She just likes you.
02:06:45 She likes that you hate the person that she like that she doesn't like.
02:06:48 That's it.
02:06:49 It's true.
02:06:50 That's it.
02:06:51 That's all there is to it.
02:06:53 It's exactly like that guy I was arguing with in the YouTube comments
02:06:56 of that one guy who claimed that Stone Toss was and smiling friends when he isn't.
02:07:01 Yeah, because most of the comments were rightfully complaining.
02:07:04 Like one that's not Stone Toss.
02:07:05 Also, he's a Nazi.
02:07:06 I don't think they'd put him in.
02:07:09 And there were like two or three people who were like, no, he's not a Nazi.
02:07:13 Why would you think that?
02:07:14 He's never done anything like that.
02:07:15 He said he said he said he's not one.
02:07:18 So he's not one.
02:07:19 Yeah, he said that he wasn't in Germany in like the 1940s and that all the Holocaust
02:07:26 and now stuff is true, which is actually how he responded.
02:07:29 He said, yeah, yeah, all the stuff I'm saying is true, actually.
02:07:31 Yeah, yeah, literally.
02:07:32 That's just defense.
02:07:33 He's like, I can't be a Nazi if the Holocaust actually didn't happen.
02:07:37 Like that's just fucking different.
02:07:40 And he's like, oh, and also like I like crypto.
02:07:42 You know what?
02:07:43 Nazis don't like crypto.
02:07:44 Yeah.
02:07:45 He's like, dude, you're just a Nazi and a crypto bro.
02:07:48 You're too bad things now.
02:07:49 Equally bad things.
02:07:51 Equally, equally bad.
02:07:53 Yeah.
02:07:53 But the person I was arguing with, like I went through the trouble again,
02:07:56 another huge YouTube comment where I like listed 20 of his comics with the dates and
02:08:02 explained exactly all of the Nazi messaging, all of the Holocaust denial.
02:08:05 How do you look at the one about like, you know, the one with like the the pie graph
02:08:10 with like the 2% of the Jewish population?
02:08:13 Yeah, yeah.
02:08:13 How do you look at that?
02:08:14 How do you explain that?
02:08:16 If it's not, if it's not not, it's just not.
02:08:18 The implication is that Jews aren't white people, which is a very common Nazi thing
02:08:23 because they they need an excuse to kill them or some shit.
02:08:25 Whoopie Goldberg needs to learn that.
02:08:28 Okay, look, I'm sorry I'm being so hard on Whoopie this week.
02:08:32 Yeah, I left this huge comment detailing every little thing all the times that he's like
02:08:37 shown scientists like proving that, you know, people of color are dumber and then like,
02:08:41 oh, but the cowardly leftists are too afraid to admit the real science that black people are dumb.
02:08:47 I know he's done that shit.
02:08:50 And I listed all these things and the guy like responded by like saying,
02:08:55 those things aren't even wrong.
02:08:57 Also, the Nazis aren't that bad.
02:08:58 Did you know the allies sided with communists?
02:09:01 Yeah.
02:09:02 So I'm like, okay.
02:09:03 So you just admitted he was a Nazi.
02:09:04 That's how it always boils down.
02:09:06 It always comes down to that.
02:09:07 If you get into the weeds, that's it always comes.
02:09:10 It always shakes out that way.
02:09:11 Can you give a comment for a key screenshot that and have Ellie say.
02:09:15 I have I have the video got fucking deleted.
02:09:17 The guy deleted his own video probably because of a comment section.
02:09:19 And also because they probably realized, yeah, it's not a stone toss difference.
02:09:22 So the video have screenshots.
02:09:24 So the video was about how stone toss is in smiling friends, even though he's not.
02:09:30 Okay.
02:09:30 So the video was called like like internet like references in smiling friends and it showed
02:09:36 a bunch of examples and it showed a picture of a grease puddle on the floor and said,
02:09:39 look, it's a reference to smiling friends is just one of many examples.
02:09:42 You mean it's not a reference.
02:09:43 It looks nothing like stone toss.
02:09:45 It's just, oh, let me see.
02:09:47 I could find a picture of the grease puddle.
02:09:48 Hold on.
02:09:49 Yeah.
02:09:49 And then it shows the screenshots of the comment so we can all see it.
02:09:53 Is a grease puddle a stone toss thing?
02:09:56 I don't even know.
02:09:56 It's not.
02:09:57 It has a face.
02:09:57 They think that they it has a face and they think that it's the cost of face.
02:10:01 It ascribes the the lip the over.
02:10:03 Oh, sure.
02:10:05 That this grease puddle had like it's sort of like it's sort of like a blur has that.
02:10:09 Yeah.
02:10:10 Yeah.
02:10:10 It's like because the Simpsons never existed.
02:10:13 Oh, yeah.
02:10:13 The Simpsons and Futurama and all that.
02:10:16 I mean, what what else could that be but a stone toss reference?
02:10:20 Clearly.
02:10:20 All right.
02:10:21 Oh, I have.
02:10:22 Oh, let me find the comment.
02:10:23 It's so funny that he just in the end just admitted that he is an Aussie and that's why
02:10:28 he's defending stone toss.
02:10:32 Here it is.
02:10:33 Let me copy that and show me, show me, show me.
02:10:38 There you go.
02:10:38 Show me, show me, show me.
02:10:39 That's like the end.
02:10:39 That's like the very end of the discussion.
02:10:41 Do that trick.
02:10:43 The one that makes me scream.
02:10:45 She said doesn't calling them.
02:10:47 Do you have a little screen?
02:10:48 Shut up.
02:10:48 You're all those things.
02:10:49 All those things are demonstrably true.
02:10:51 Just calling it Nazi propaganda doesn't mean that it's not true, dude.
02:10:57 Nazis aren't even all that bad.
02:11:00 Just not even.
02:11:01 Oh, my God.
02:11:01 I thought you were paraphrasing.
02:11:03 I thought you were paraphrasing.
02:11:05 Nazis aren't even bad.
02:11:06 That's disgusting, he did it.
02:11:07 Good old Hazen.
02:11:09 Nazis aren't even bad lucks here in the comment section.
02:11:15 Good for him.
02:11:16 Good for him.
02:11:18 Living, sticking to his principles.
02:11:20 All I wanted to say about that was I said something.
02:11:24 It was a few weeks ago.
02:11:25 I just made a tricksy tweet and the day after I called her a Nazi may message DM me to be like,
02:11:32 Ben, I appreciate you.
02:11:33 Thank you so much for doing this.
02:11:35 And I said, thanks.
02:11:36 And then she told me, did you know, did you know tricksy used to cry,
02:11:39 used to literally like cry tears when I, when I would say like,
02:11:44 we need to take care of the taxes?
02:11:46 Like instead of, like instead of doing, doing her taxes,
02:11:50 tricksy would just cry.
02:11:51 And I was like, lol, that, that sounds about right.
02:11:53 That doesn't surprise me at all.
02:11:55 But thanks for confirming.
02:11:58 Thanks for confirming what I already assumed to be true.
02:12:01 Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick.
02:12:04 The one that makes you be Nazi.
02:12:08 Die, die.
02:12:10 Die, die.
02:12:13 All those things are demonstrably true.
02:12:14 Calling them Nazi doesn't make them any less real.
02:12:21 And it has to be stated, the things I listed were Holocaust denial,
02:12:26 the JQ, the great replacement, race, realism, anti-Semitism,
02:12:30 and right supremacist pseudo-science.
02:12:32 Even admits that the pseudo-science is true.
02:12:34 Calling them Nazi doesn't make those things not real though.
02:12:40 I love it.
02:12:40 I love it.
02:12:41 It's so fucked.
02:12:44 I can't believe, I can't believe smiling friends, I don't even need the final word.
02:12:47 I can't believe smiling friends promotes Holocaust denial,
02:12:50 the JQ, the great replacement, race, realism, anti-Semitism
02:12:53 and white supremacist pseudo-science.
02:12:55 That's so fucked up.
02:12:58 Doesn't the smiling friends guy do NFTs?
02:13:01 He did some like very early on and then never mentioned NFTs again.
02:13:06 Oh, did he?
02:13:07 Okay.
02:13:07 No, it was just free of him, I think.
02:13:10 It was just like free little animated GIFs.
02:13:12 Well, all right, okay, nice.
02:13:18 Show's good though, I liked it.
02:13:19 I have, you know, I tried to watch it, I googled it,
02:13:22 trying to find some site that had it for free to watch
02:13:25 and I couldn't find it and I gave up.
02:13:27 You can watch my first two episodes for free on Adult Swim
02:13:29 and I can link you a little funny zip file with the rest of the episodes if you want.
02:13:34 It wanted me to like sign up for an account,
02:13:36 I didn't want to make an account on Adult Swim.
02:13:38 Wait, I didn't even have to make an account.
02:13:40 No?
02:13:40 Did you already have an account?
02:13:41 I wasn't even allowed on the site.
02:13:43 Because I was a child.
02:13:46 No, because I was swimming or maybe because I wasn't swimming.
02:13:51 I mean, I can just give you, like, I have a media fire link
02:13:55 that I uploaded myself with all the episodes except episode one,
02:13:59 which should be available for free somewhere.
02:14:03 Isn't that the pilot?
02:14:05 Yeah, the pilot.
02:14:05 I thought it was just, wasn't it even on the YouTube for free?
02:14:07 I don't remember.
02:14:09 They put it on YouTube, that's how...
02:14:11 I don't know why, I googled it and I didn't see any result,
02:14:14 I didn't immediately find results that showed me it and I was like,
02:14:17 ah, I'll just go watch Mind Killer instead.
02:14:23 I'll just go watch Mind Sweeper.
02:14:24 No regrets.
02:14:27 No, why Mind Sweeper when you can play Wordle?
02:14:32 Yeah.
02:14:33 Wordle's the new Mind Sweeper.
02:14:35 Because Wordle is only fun due to luck.
02:14:43 I found a...
02:14:44 Like it's easy to do.
02:14:45 It's easy to do, but like whether or not you have
02:14:47 a fun time is due to like the luck of your guesses versus what the word is.
02:14:52 Wordle basically solves itself.
02:14:56 Wordle, I think Wordle is designed to make you think you're smart when you're not.
02:15:02 You think you're solving a puzzle, but actually the letters are eliminating themselves.
02:15:08 I guess that's good puzzle design.
02:15:11 Good game design.
02:15:11 There's some smartness going on if you can think of the word with the information you have,
02:15:21 but not when it starts off, you have no information.
02:15:23 I use a Scrabble dictionary, so I don't think there's not even any skill involved.
02:15:28 I don't even have to know words.
02:15:33 Feels like cheating.
02:15:34 I don't even speak English.
02:15:35 Feels like cheating, but it's not.
02:15:38 I should play on a hard mode.
02:15:40 It should switch to hard mode.
02:15:42 Yeah, you got to switch to hard mode.
02:15:44 I mean, I pretty much already play on a hard mode already.
02:15:47 Playing on like when you can just do whatever on each thing.
02:15:51 You just do two words that have a bunch of like common letters in them.
02:15:55 You get too much information and it's like, oh, it's obviously this.
02:15:58 That's right.
02:15:59 Well, but I want to win though, but I don't want to lose.
02:16:02 You can't win.
02:16:03 The only way to win is to get extremely lucky on the first guess.
02:16:06 Are you winning, Ben?
02:16:10 Yeah, because it's some playing on easy mode.
02:16:13 I use the same starting word every single time, audio,
02:16:17 and eventually it'll be Ryan.
02:16:19 I use aches.
02:16:21 Wait, aches?
02:16:23 A-C-H-E-S.
02:16:29 I use a different word every time.
02:16:32 If I think of a funny word, I'll use a different one.
02:16:35 I wanted to start yesterday.
02:16:37 I wanted to start with the word think.
02:16:39 I wanted to start with the word think, and I'm like, no, I'll do audio first.
02:16:43 And then it only got me like one letter.
02:16:45 And I'm like, okay, well, that letter is in think.
02:16:47 So I'll just type think anyway.
02:16:49 And then think gave me way more results.
02:16:52 And then I got it the next try.
02:16:53 I could have gotten it in two if I just started with think.
02:16:56 Do you think of like the common ways that letters group up
02:17:01 to form parts of words like T-H and S-H?
02:17:03 Somebody.
02:17:04 And Q-U and like things.
02:17:07 Somebody.
02:17:07 I usually go for like there or not there, but like maybe there with an I-E-I-R.
02:17:14 Somebody somewhere has gotten it in one.
02:17:19 Yeah.
02:17:19 Munchie got in one.
02:17:21 What?
02:17:21 Whoa, really?
02:17:22 Munchie got in one really early on.
02:17:23 He was like, wait, really?
02:17:24 Now every everything will be like less satisfying for now.
02:17:28 Yeah, why?
02:17:28 Yeah, that's it.
02:17:30 You're done.
02:17:31 You beat wordle when you get it in one.
02:17:34 You don't have to play anymore.
02:17:35 You're free.
02:17:36 Then they show up at your house and give you a medal.
02:17:39 They give you a word.
02:17:40 And then that's when he quit the PZP.
02:17:42 He's like, you know, I already accomplished my life.
02:17:44 I don't need to be here.
02:17:46 Because he had a vision of him winning wordle.
02:17:49 Exactly.
02:17:49 And it like in years in the future.
02:17:51 Hayao Miyazaki comes to your house and gives you a congressional medal of honor
02:17:56 and gives you the purple heart.
02:17:57 I don't know why it's him.
02:17:59 What are the what's the mistake?
02:18:01 Does Ohio have five letters?
02:18:03 H-A-Y-A-O?
02:18:07 Hayao?
02:18:10 Because I must.
02:18:11 Ohio.
02:18:12 Ohio.
02:18:12 Because I must.
02:18:15 Do you see my you see my Simpsons?
02:18:17 You see my Simpsons comic?
02:18:19 The what?
02:18:20 Yeah, you retweeted it.
02:18:21 I retweeted some.
02:18:22 I think Cheesy Manfredo, I think like remembered it or someone someone like
02:18:28 remembered that I drew that Simpsons comic playing like three years ago
02:18:31 and like liked it and retweeted it and I was like hey that was pretty good.
02:18:36 I should it was the best thing I ever made and it's all been downhill from there.
02:18:40 Yeah, let me let me find it.
02:18:45 It's it's almost like it's okay remember when I used to make comics?
02:18:50 When I used to draw stuff.
02:18:51 Ben same predicted the Simpsons.
02:18:54 Oh my god, this is great.
02:18:56 I love this.
02:18:57 I think it's pretty funny.
02:18:58 I think it's pretty funny.
02:19:00 It's probably the funniest thing I ever made.
02:19:02 Well, look, the image appeared.
02:19:04 He's drinking CC lemon.
02:19:08 I love CC lemon over there.
02:19:10 I've never had it.
02:19:11 I just know that it had like Simpsons branding.
02:19:15 I guess it's lemonade.
02:19:18 I don't know.
02:19:21 It's constructively criticizing lemons.
02:19:26 They could they could they could be better.
02:19:29 They could they could be doing a better job, frankly.
02:19:33 That's what the lemons say to you when you drink it.
02:19:38 Constructive criticism lemon.
02:19:44 I don't know.
02:19:47 Lol, Japan.
02:19:49 Japan sure is wacky.
02:19:51 Wow, it's so funny.
02:19:52 I love Japan period.
02:19:54 I do love Japan period.
02:19:58 I don't know.
02:19:58 You guys want to go?
02:19:59 You guys want to start?
02:19:59 I love Edo period.
02:20:02 voicemails or Japan?
02:20:04 Yeah, voicemails.
02:20:06 All right, voicemails.
02:20:07 We have two two fucking many of them.
02:20:12 Oh my god.
02:20:13 I can't wait.
02:20:13 I can't wait.
02:20:14 Is it people saying 300 related things?
02:20:17 I don't know.
02:20:18 We didn't even say this is Sparta.
02:20:20 That was my big idea and I forgot.
02:20:22 Say it.
02:20:22 Say it.
02:20:23 I know there is there is actually like not too late.
02:20:27 It's too late.
02:20:27 The moment is past.
02:20:29 Hold on.
02:20:30 You just reminded me.
02:20:31 Microtopics.
02:20:32 I have like 11 YouTube channels actually.
02:20:36 Yeah.
02:20:37 Wow.
02:20:38 And all of them,
02:20:39 almost all of them have like seen success at some point.
02:20:42 Randomly.
02:20:45 Oh, I need to find this one.
02:20:48 I don't.
02:20:49 I know.
02:20:50 I only I think I know three of them.
02:20:53 You have that.
02:20:53 Yeah, I have that.
02:20:54 There's a pony audio one.
02:20:57 Yeah, pony audio one.
02:20:59 Didn't you have one that was like a pony audio drama?
02:21:02 Yes, I did.
02:21:03 Yeah.
02:21:05 So.
02:21:05 So I know three of your channel.
02:21:08 Yeah.
02:21:08 So I.
02:21:09 All right.
02:21:09 So there's a blooming fall.
02:21:10 There's a blooming fall after dark,
02:21:11 which used to be called Demis Studios.
02:21:14 It was an old ship post channel that made like really bad videos
02:21:18 and promoted conspiracy theories as a joke.
02:21:21 My favorite.
02:21:22 And then I rebranded it when it got popular.
02:21:25 There's Nightfall Studios,
02:21:27 which also used to be called a blooming fall that has like 60k subscribers.
02:21:30 There's Nightfalls Radio,
02:21:32 which has the audio drama.
02:21:33 Yeah.
02:21:34 There's a blooming fall plays,
02:21:36 which is a gaming channel.
02:21:36 I had a video blog there as well.
02:21:38 Actually, let me mention that.
02:21:41 So yeah, the the Mrs.
02:21:42 Spartiffing reminded me of this video on one of a fucking random channel I made in like 2009.
02:21:47 Dragon Master Pivot.
02:21:50 Um, this video got 100,000 views randomly on that like 29.
02:21:54 29 subscribers.
02:21:57 Yeah.
02:21:57 I it's the only video.
02:22:00 Okay.
02:22:00 So back in like 2008,
02:22:02 I was like super obsessed with like 13 years ago.
02:22:05 Did YouTube even exist 13 years ago?
02:22:08 It usually has been around since 2005.
02:22:10 Oh, dear.
02:22:12 Um, it's been around for like 17 years.
02:22:16 Okay.
02:22:16 Yes.
02:22:18 Yes.
02:22:18 Oh my god.
02:22:19 That's crazy.
02:22:19 Whatever.
02:22:20 But anyways, I made like a free side channels because I was like,
02:22:24 I want to create the Aragon series.
02:22:26 I want to animate the entire all the Aragon books in pivot animation.
02:22:30 I'm going to do it all by myself and I'm going to have a YouTube channel for each book.
02:22:35 Actually, no, that's unrelated.
02:22:38 But like, I'm like going to animate the Aragon books and I'm going to have,
02:22:42 I created a special YouTube channel for each.
02:22:45 Um, so there's, there's, there's like the Aragon book one, Aragon book two,
02:22:48 Aragon book three.
02:22:49 So I was free YouTube channels,
02:22:50 but I also want to pretend that I have fans who like love me and like simp for me.
02:22:54 So I'm going to create free extra channels for the free channels
02:22:57 and we're going to pretend that we're collabing,
02:22:59 but it's actually just me collabing with myself.
02:23:01 And that was Dragon Master Pivot.
02:23:04 Word of the Senior and a few others.
02:23:06 So I created six YouTube channels just for this project
02:23:08 and free of him would just fake people.
02:23:10 And this is one of the fake people and this
02:23:13 animation is an animation that this fake person they made up
02:23:16 created to enter one of my competitions,
02:23:18 to create an animation about that.
02:23:20 So this is you pretending to be someone else making a cartoon
02:23:26 to enter my contest that you made?
02:23:30 Yes.
02:23:32 And, and so that's like six YouTube channels
02:23:37 by itself.
02:23:38 And then I have like six other ones now.
02:23:40 But yeah, when you said this is Sparta, Sparta, I got reminded of that.

02:24:22 a true story of this lady who like rose to become one
02:24:26 of the most powerful Harry Potter fanfic writers and community mods.
02:24:32 Of all time, basically by like creating basically her,
02:24:36 her tactic was to make fake accounts pretending to be like Christian like moral guardians
02:24:45 who were there to like defend Harry Potter fanfic from like sin and then as these people
02:24:52 she would make lists of like bad like like don't read these authors because they're sinful
02:24:59 and then she would put herself on these lists and then people would be like oh my god I
02:25:03 gotta go read this shit yeah she wanted to be part of the cool kids club with like the
02:25:09 cool Harry Potter fanfic yeah yeah yeah yeah she would make the list would have there and

02:27:20 guitar hero but it's free it's for the PC it's better it has a whole bunch of features that
02:27:25 original guitar hero games didn't it's really fun and you just download it and you make custom
02:27:29 songs and it's good is it called clone hero because it's a clone of guitar hero it is literally
02:27:36 just a clone like it uses some of the same code but a guy was caught cheating a guy called
02:27:43 shmui he was he was too good at the game and he was like posting accomplishments that were like
02:27:49 inhuman and it turned out that he was faking them and he got caught earlier this month and what I
02:27:55 did is the day I found out I posted a video of me doing one of his fake accomplishments but like
02:28:03 really fake is that you yeah that's me in the second video and my video surpassed the original
02:28:10 in views that he had faked as of yesterday are you faking this or is this real it's real
02:28:17 that second link I posted like give it a watch it's just a minute long this is real real live
02:28:22 there's nothing fake about it that is you I recognize you are you are you are swimming goggles
02:28:29 those are gamer goggles those are gamer goggles I don't I don't really know I don't really know
02:28:38 what to make of what I'm seeing here you play with your teeth
02:28:53 ordinary people Jimmy Hendrix created people this video
02:29:23 good good good video that's a great note to end on thank you everyone for the PCP 300 episode
02:29:37 goodbye PCP just realized my audio has been fucked this entire time I hope it's better now oh well
02:29:44 we got Craig we got Craig all right should we start voicemails okay let's let me just all
02:29:54 right let's not let's not dilly-dally too much here the first one is hold on the first one is
02:30:02 called message on crypto three two one go okay on that on that crypto chat from last step I think
02:30:13 majorly your points kind of stand but the thing is there is one major issue that I see with your
02:30:21 guys's view of it and that is that you think that crypto is a investment and my opinion it's not
02:30:32 to be I mean it's in the name it's cryptocurrency and not a crypto investment that's meant to be
02:30:38 used kind of like you use cash yeah that's what it's meant to be and it doesn't function that way
02:30:43 because people only use it as an investment because that's all it's a meal or something and you do
02:30:48 it through crypto and I think that's like a major thing that a lot of people don't really get no
02:30:56 no similar kind of deal like I get that that's what it's supposed to be mainly it doesn't the
02:31:01 problem is that it doesn't work as currency because it's so inefficient I have just meant to be used
02:31:06 like it costs me $80 to move $60 worth of tether out of my wallet you know it's worthless stuff
02:31:14 like that with the blockchain it's all public right there are cryptos that are better at doing
02:31:21 that this guy likes crypto for example tomorrow it's got this signature thing we're basically five
02:31:28 people sign the transaction and then it goes through so you can't really tell which of those
02:31:34 five people were actually quite surprised that someone just sent an unironic like so crypto
02:31:42 good actually one of five people send this transaction and you don't know who jeez when I
02:31:48 send a transaction through visa it's not fucking public record for anyone to look at isn't that great
02:31:53 like yeah only like the bank or visa card holder like usually sees that so I you're supposed to
02:32:00 like a currency but it's worse in every way than I have I have dabbled like having all your
02:32:05 transaction public is a good thing I don't understand I have I have dabbled in it yeah
02:32:10 that's true also I have I have dabbled in it enough and everything I have learned an experience
02:32:15 that way tells me like oh this is this sucks this is I would never I would never use this
02:32:21 this could never be like a thing that I would like use you know in the real world for anything
02:32:28 it's simply you know you know the only gas fees man it's insane imagine you gotta spend a hundred
02:32:34 fucking dollars every time you make any transaction at all unbelievable did you see like a year ago
02:32:41 like there there was like I saw this being posted around like a bunch of like twitter threads
02:32:46 of um people like just linking to child porn and being like send me like one dollar's worth of
02:32:52 bitcoin and you can access um people were just posting this shit publicly on twitter and I'm
02:32:58 like wow what how do you think the crypto market is so wonderful how do they how can they do that
02:33:03 and be free citizens I don't fucking know does that work like I like the thing is I it was like
02:33:12 it was like a year ago I saw just a bunch of posts people were sharing them like going look at this
02:33:16 shit it's fucked up and like yeah and like there were tweets like you could like look at the tweet
02:33:22 and it like wasn't deleted by twitter and it's like what the fuck how is this allowed um but
02:33:27 great question you know I saw like 10 or 20 of those and that's more of when I've seen genuine
02:33:31 products added like advertised using crypto so I guess they found the market crypto is for
02:33:38 illegal thing crypto is such a it's so reputable it's for illegal things you know when you want to
02:33:43 buy it's for illegal things that's like the only thing yeah that's what we're child for is illegal
02:33:47 things the the the reason NFTs are hot is because it's like oh finally there's something not illegal
02:33:52 we can buy yeah the the only um the the unwieldiness of of like of the transactions and like like
02:34:03 gas fees and stuff are just they're just they're just they're totally prohibitive they'll they'll
02:34:08 simply never it's an issue that can never be overcome and can never it's it's simply can't
02:34:14 be used for what it was sort of maybe meant to be used for as in money I don't know you know
02:34:21 there are also there are also communities like in America and around the world that are being
02:34:24 destroyed because the electricity price is locally skyrocketing because there's some fucking crypto
02:34:29 mine nearby right and that's using up so much energy but they have to jack up the price and then
02:34:34 regular people who are like poor can't fucking afford it um well you know they rise up those
02:34:40 people should have invested those people should have invested in crypto and then they wouldn't
02:34:44 be if they took personal responsibility they would have invested already yeah
02:34:49 the problem is the responsibility of seeing into the future to know when everything rises and falls
02:34:55 responsibility if you didn't want your art to be stolen after you died and minted into an NFT
02:35:00 you should have made it an NFT you should have minted idiot if you didn't want your art to be
02:35:04 stolen you should have just made it an NFT already and you shouldn't have died you should have lived
02:35:09 long enough to like that's an NFT bro thank you somebody I don't understand people who like
02:35:19 NFTs because I can't separate them from the concept of theft anymore it's not I'll be honest
02:35:25 I'll be honest I don't I saw I saw one person the only I saw one person who was like posting some
02:35:31 NFT shit and it's all it's all people that have financial stake this one person posted an article
02:35:37 that was like here how how I how I succeeded with my NFT project and it was like their their their
02:35:43 project was it was like you know it was one of these shitty like asset uh you know mix and mix
02:35:48 and match uh uh what's the word it was one of those dress up game icons yeah what's what's the word
02:35:54 for uh for like the the character creator pig pig crew yeah it's a pig crew avatar it was it was
02:36:01 it was it looked like shit it was ducks it was a little cartoon ducks and it was like I had a
02:36:05 successful NFT launch like here's how I did it everyone an article about it and I responded
02:36:10 with a single word trash and they they blocked me um I felt great I felt great I felt great
02:36:16 about him because he spoke the truth yeah um I loved it uh but I guess I'm thankful that like I
02:36:27 don't see I don't I feel I feel like the tide is turning I feel like public opinion has has
02:36:32 come down pretty heavily on like nobody likes this shit I mean it's all the bad things it's theft
02:36:39 it's does nothing for anyone everyone is only used to speculate uh it it's bad for the environment
02:36:47 and it's ugly there's nothing positive about it I I mean you know you're not you don't get the art
02:36:52 you just get a receipt that's it's you get a receipt for the URL as people can change and I
02:36:57 I mean the URL can die yeah I I just want people to change I want someone to hack into them
02:37:04 and change all the URLs to a link to um Rick Astley's never gonna give you up there's
02:37:08 to a rick roll there should rick roll plenty of there's been like loads and loads of examples of
02:37:15 people's NFTs being hacked and stolen because they're just yep they're not actually secure at all
02:37:22 they're not as secure as they they imagine it's much easier to not worry about owning a PNG
02:37:32 in that way because you just it's not valuable nobody cares about the only reason the only reason
02:37:42 they care about it is because of its uniqueness and that uniqueness does not actually exist because
02:37:48 it's so easily stealable even in NFTs you just remember I mean literally nobody can stop you
02:37:54 literally there's no value for anyone literally the point of it is to say I spent $200,000 on a
02:38:01 worthless PNG of an ape like it's that's that's the point of it uh no no the the apes must have value
02:38:07 the apes must have value so the value can keep going up so everyone succeeds the second you
02:38:11 start talking shit you're gonna make us all fail we have to all believe that this is good and right
02:38:15 and we're going to make money otherwise it will the point is not to say that you've spent $200,000
02:38:21 the point is to convince people that you actually did that so that they can spend money and then
02:38:27 you can like get like money from people being tricked it's just it's well yeah it's to say I
02:38:34 spent $200,000 on an ape and I don't regret it and number and line go up and also I made some new
02:38:40 apes that you can get and you can be like me if you buy my apes
02:38:47 or ducks or whatever. Can we make this episode on NFTs? Can we make this episode on the blockchain?
02:38:52 You know what I think probably I mean Saber Sharks YouTube channel is an NFT
02:38:58 someone minted it someone minted it without his permission yeah like just just the channel itself
02:39:04 that's awesome holy that's awful that's really bad good for him you know good for him I'm proud
02:39:11 in a way but it also means absolutely nothing it's really funny I wonder what the ramification
02:39:16 I wonder what the ramifications of uh of minting uh the uh the asterisk or suck series would be oh
02:39:25 my god Ben you should do it you should do it it's all fake don't encourage him oh my god yeah
02:39:31 what if I did Ben there's one way to find out because you know you know I'm referencing that
02:39:37 just Trixie said that she tweeted the what would the ramifications of minting the asterisk war
02:39:41 sucks series be I what if I just minted it yes it's a funny joke but please it's not funny if you
02:39:54 actually do it if you actually do it it becomes stupid I don't even know how I don't even know
02:40:01 how one well minting it would probably cost you more money than like you'd actually it would probably
02:40:05 it costs like a hundred bucks right to like mint artist overwhelmingly lose money on NFTs like
02:40:10 most of them will sell for like 15 bucks yeah like like the average sale is like 300 but that's
02:40:17 only because of like the few whales who spent like 60 million dollars yeah you know yeah but like if
02:40:22 you look at if you look at the mean sale it's like 15 if you're if you're a famous if you're famous
02:40:27 already if you have that social capital or whatever and you have a famous person who will buy it off
02:40:32 you and like you both like we can nudge and like you know that you're doing this just to inflate the
02:40:36 price so you can both benefit which is yeah how the shit actually works I am I am rapidly dying
02:40:42 shall we move on to the next yes yes that's fair yeah oh I just wanted to show this image that my
02:40:51 good friend Lane show me today so the stick the son of John Lennon posted this oh Sean Ono Lennon
02:41:01 haha this y'all better follow the inimitable sailor aka gigachat aka the rocket man aka bitcoin

02:56:44 when i'm feeling like i'm not improving i'm not working as hard as i could be to get better

02:58:28 it's a good decision i hate music
02:58:30 bang bang max is having made sure she was dead
02:58:40 you never heard maxville silver hammer wait is that like a past murderer wait is it actually
02:58:45 the the whole song is just about a guy killing a bunch of people with his hammer i i guess i have
02:58:50 never actually listened to the song and and the rest of the beat was hated it really
02:58:56 palma carney wrote it and everyone hated it except him is that where is it about i
02:59:01 thought the song was about dwarf fortress because silver is the best material to make
02:59:06 hammers out of because it's the heaviest and deals the most damage uh that's not true because dwarf
02:59:12 fortress did not exist no it is no it's true gold's gold's heavy even silver minecraft facts told
02:59:19 me this uh in i think though i in i know that in dwarf fortress steel steel is the best metal to
02:59:28 make like blades out of but silver is the best metal to make clubs and and hammers out of uh
02:59:35 because i think it is heavier than it's maybe it's heavier than gold or maybe like the softness
02:59:40 of the gold makes it worse in some other way i don't remember wait there's no silver in minecraft

03:03:19 This is the episode.
03:03:20 Yeah.
03:03:21 Bambi nimble, keep me quick.
03:03:24 He's pretty long gone.
03:03:26 I don't get why.
03:03:28 I get sick.

03:03:36 PCP.
03:03:41 PCP.

03:03:48 Yeah.
03:03:52 Yeah.
03:03:54 Yeah.
03:03:55 Oh, fuck.
03:03:57 I'm going to fucking withdraws.
03:04:02 Oh, god.
03:04:03 Oh, fuck.
03:04:04 I've got to put that given benefit of occasional guests right into my veins.
03:04:08 Oh, god.
03:04:09 Oh, fuck.
03:04:13 PCP.
03:04:18 PCP.
03:04:23 PCP.
03:04:28 PCP.
03:04:33 PCP.
03:04:35 Yes.
03:04:36 Yes.
03:04:37 Oh, fucking god.
03:04:38 Yes.
03:04:39 It's in my veins right now.
03:04:40 Oh, it's so good.
03:04:41 Oh, fuck.
03:04:42 I feel so fucking good.
03:04:43 Just show me straight up my veins.
03:04:44 My veins.
03:04:45 Oh, they're fucking bulging.
03:04:46 My veins are bulging.
03:04:47 They're biting.
03:04:48 Oh, my god.
03:04:49 Oh, fuck.
03:04:50 Yes.
03:04:51 That guy really do be true.
03:04:56 It do be like that, though.
03:04:59 Yes.
03:05:00 Wow.
03:05:01 The happy 300 episodes.
03:05:03 Here's to at least one more.
03:05:07 That'd be cool.
03:05:08 One more.
03:05:09 We'll have 300 episodes.
03:05:12 That was great.
03:05:13 That deserves a voice grail, I think.
03:05:18 Sure.
03:05:19 Why not?
03:05:20 I think that was another one from Mutsu Dusty Dumps.
03:05:29 Tokyo Man.
03:05:30 Maybe there should be a different thing.
03:05:33 Tokyo Guy should be.
03:05:34 That guy definitely deserves grail, a status by this point.
03:05:42 I said his name last time.
03:05:44 PCP greatest hits.
03:05:46 He should release an album.
03:05:48 He should release an album on Bandcamp of all his PCP voicemails.
03:05:54 Unironically, yes.
03:05:55 Dude, I should do that with Floss Tapes Archive.
03:05:57 Make it a bank.
03:05:58 Yeah, sure.
03:05:59 Yes.
03:06:00 Yeah.
03:06:01 Why on God's name?
03:06:02 Unironically.
03:06:03 There's no reason not to.
03:06:07 Okay, next one is, I've got to find it here.
03:06:10 It's called Boston Question Mark.
03:06:13 Three, two, one, go.
03:06:15 I'm going to Boston in a couple of weeks for the School Psychologist Convention.
03:06:20 It's in like, I don't know, Central Boston at the Heinz Convention Center.
03:06:24 I mean, I don't know where that is in Boston.
03:06:26 I don't know anything about Boston.
03:06:28 That's what I'm asking.
03:06:29 What are some things I can do along there?
03:06:32 Jesus.
03:06:33 Wrap up warm.
03:06:34 Yes.
03:06:35 Some things to do in Boston that are good and don't suck.
03:06:42 Ride the T.
03:06:44 Travel from A to B.
03:06:46 That's it.
03:06:47 That's my favorite thing about Boston is the T.
03:06:49 So just ride it.
03:06:51 There's restaurants?
03:06:52 I mean, when I was in Boston, I was mostly just hanging out.
03:06:55 We went to restaurants and I played Pokemon Go.
03:06:58 Yeah.
03:06:59 It was fun.
03:07:00 I don't know about things to do.
03:07:02 I don't know if there's anything that I'd be like, oh, you got to check out the such-and-such
03:07:10 museum or whatever.
03:07:12 I don't know.
03:07:14 I don't.
03:07:15 I don't know.
03:07:16 I just live here, man.
03:07:18 I don't do shit.
03:07:21 I feel dumb.
03:07:23 I feel like I should have some.
03:07:26 One good thing.
03:07:28 One interesting neat thing.
03:07:31 That's cool.
03:07:32 But I can't.
03:07:34 There's nothing.
03:07:36 Gabe, was there anything that you thought was cool when you were here?
03:07:40 I mean, I generally like the vibe of the place.
03:07:44 It's got cool architecture and roads.
03:07:46 It's not like a grid city.
03:07:48 Just ride the T.
03:07:50 Just get on the T and just go wherever it takes you.
03:07:53 Don't even sweat it.
03:07:55 Don't even worry about where you end up.
03:07:57 Just get right from the end of the green line all the way to the end of the red line to the end of the blue line.
03:08:04 Dude, red line is so cool.
03:08:06 Seven years.
03:08:08 Hand drawn.
03:08:10 All right.
03:08:12 Next one is...
03:08:14 I don't know what this is.
03:08:16 Hold on.
03:08:18 Is that the URL?
03:08:22 Yeah.
03:08:23 Okay.
03:08:24 This is a blog post from Blogspot called
03:08:28 The Truth in its Essence
03:08:31 about my debut book.
03:08:34 Do you carry a secret?
03:08:36 Here's a synopsis about do you carry a secret and fear to let it out.
03:08:40 Veena Schecker.
03:08:42 I am a practicing optometrist in India with over 25 years of experience in the field.
03:08:49 I don't...
03:08:51 Okay.
03:08:52 Cool. Yes.
03:08:54 Is there a joke hidden in here?
03:08:56 I don't know.
03:08:58 I'm not looking for it.
03:09:00 Veena Schecker is a fan of the PCP.
03:09:03 She's promoting her book.
03:09:05 And you know what?
03:09:07 I'll give you a song called Deck and Schecker for you to listen to.
03:09:10 Veena, I'm proud of you.
03:09:13 You did it.
03:09:15 They said it couldn't be done.
03:09:17 Deck and Schecker, what is this?
03:09:20 It's just a song by Infected Mushroom.
03:09:23 I've seen the word Schecker twice in my life now.
03:09:26 First here and now this person's surname.
03:09:30 Oh, my head.
03:09:32 It's a weird album cover.
03:09:34 My head is pounding.
03:09:36 You drew that album art.
03:09:38 Somehow my hangover is getting worse.
03:09:40 Somehow it is getting...
03:09:44 It is only progressing and becoming worse as time goes on.
03:09:48 Next.
03:09:49 How many fingers am I holding?
03:09:51 What time is it?
03:09:53 I can't tell.
03:09:55 It's 1.25 p.m.
03:09:58 Oh, it's 4.25 a.m.
03:10:01 Maybe I feel sick.
03:10:04 Maybe it's not a hangover.
03:10:06 Maybe it's that I broke keto.
03:10:08 Maybe it's that I stopped being keto, even though I already wasn't.
03:10:11 Maybe that's why I'm full of poison.
03:10:13 I'm full of poisonous carbs, causing deadly inflammation.
03:10:16 You really couldn't make such a mistake.
03:10:19 I ate a couple of french fries.
03:10:21 I had a couple of french fries someone gave me yesterday.
03:10:25 I was already drinking beer, so why not?
03:10:28 Why are you drinking beer?
03:10:30 I have been so clean.
03:10:32 I have been two straight weeks.
03:10:34 Feeding socially.
03:10:36 Two straight weeks of extremely scrupulous calorie counting.
03:10:40 I deserved it.
03:10:42 Now I deserve this hangover.
03:10:45 Whatever.
03:10:47 Shut up.
03:10:48 Next voicemail is
03:10:50 for Cybershell with Love.
03:10:52 3, 2, 1, go.
03:10:54 Cybershell, I hope you're on for this one.
03:11:00 If only he were here.
03:11:02 If only.
03:11:04 We'll pass it on.
03:11:06 Yeah, we'll let him know.
03:11:08 We'll just tag him.
03:11:10 Hi, here's a special message for that guy who just left that voicemail.
03:11:14 Sorry it wasn't on this episode,
03:11:16 but it was just on that 5 and a half hour long episode that came out less than a month ago.
03:11:20 So just listen to that one again.
03:11:22 Next one is called
03:11:24 Come Eat Duck with Wong Chung.
03:11:27 Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:11:43 Wong Chung goes back.
03:11:45 You like to say,
03:11:47 why don't you come to China with me?
03:11:49 We can both catch corona
03:11:51 and eat duck together.
03:11:53 I like duck.
03:11:55 Duck is good.
03:11:57 Duck is good.
03:11:59 I just got reminded that one character is supposed to come back on the 300 episode.
03:12:03 Which character?
03:12:05 I guess we'll see.
03:12:07 Wait, what?
03:12:09 Spoilers?
03:12:11 Alright, next one is called
03:12:13 I hope Riley is on.
03:12:17 Posting it now.
03:12:19 Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:12:23 Okay.
03:12:25 I'm sorry, he's not on.
03:12:27 Maybe next time.
03:12:29 He quit Yig.
03:12:31 He quit Yig. We'll never hear from him again.
03:12:33 Wait, really?
03:12:35 He did.
03:12:37 He just cancelled and he's taken Yig out of his profile,
03:12:41 his Twitter bio.
03:12:43 That's funny.
03:12:45 Is there an RB yet?
03:12:47 The PCP lasted longer than Voidcasers.
03:12:49 That's true.
03:12:51 We'll miss him.
03:12:53 We'll miss that boy.
03:12:55 Is there an RB yet?
03:12:59 He's moving back to the defunct one in his dad's yard.
03:13:03 One assumes.
03:13:05 Next one is called
03:13:07 Come With Comrades, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:13:13 Hello, comrades.
03:13:15 Nikola is back.
03:13:17 We have offer for you.
03:13:19 Would you like to come invade Ukraine with Nikola and other comrades?
03:13:23 Yes.
03:13:25 Sounds good, yeah.
03:13:27 Thanks.
03:13:29 Ukraine has always had a similar name to the UK.
03:13:33 I think it's time for them to die.
03:13:35 I think it's time.
03:13:37 Ukraine.
03:13:39 That's not in Ukraine.
03:13:41 You just want to kill mage, Gabe.
03:13:43 You've always just wanted to kill mage.
03:13:45 No, it's not true.
03:13:47 It's not true.
03:13:49 It's Brexit because I will break her legs.
03:13:53 Ukraine is next to Poland, I think,
03:13:57 and so is Lithuania more or less,
03:13:59 so I'm pretty sure they're the same.
03:14:01 They're different plays.
03:14:03 Adjacent to refuse is refuse.
03:14:05 She went to the Ukraine for the weekend
03:14:09 exactly when you went to destroy it.
03:14:11 I swear, I don't want to kill mage or break her legs.
03:14:15 This is my pledge.
03:14:17 Didn't she go to Ukraine
03:14:19 for some kind of weird health therapy camp
03:14:25 to prevent her gallbladder surgery or something?
03:14:33 She got the gallbladder removed.
03:14:37 She did get her gallbladder removed,
03:14:39 but before that she went for a long time
03:14:41 to some kind of crystal healing health camp
03:14:45 in the UK.
03:14:47 I think she just wanted to see a lot of the purple
03:14:51 that was there.
03:14:53 She made up the health stuff
03:14:55 just to see some purple.
03:14:57 I think that's probably true.
03:15:01 Good old mage.
03:15:03 How come we never get no mage, no watch in the comments?
03:15:09 Because mage doesn't deserve this podcast.
03:15:11 Mage just hangs out on her Discord
03:15:13 and is cool and people talk to her.
03:15:15 Yeah.
03:15:17 They watch her live stream.
03:15:19 Do you actually?
03:15:21 That's Rem Kochmar?
03:15:23 Yeah, Rem Kochmar.
03:15:25 Yeah, I watch one of them.
03:15:27 She does the VTuber thing pretty well.
03:15:29 She even sounds like a VTuber.
03:15:31 She learns to talk like them.
03:15:33 She's always had a nice voice.
03:15:37 I guess it's a logical thing.
03:15:39 She sounds like a little crazy character.
03:15:41 It's like she doesn't sound like herself.
03:15:43 She just sounds like a character ever so slightly.
03:15:45 You can tell it's her,
03:15:47 but she talks just a little differently
03:15:49 than she would on the PCP and it's interesting.
03:15:51 Huh.
03:15:53 I guess given her skill set,
03:15:57 VTubing makes a lot of sense.
03:15:59 Now that I think about it.
03:16:01 She's like a natural conclusion.
03:16:05 She has a pretty voice.
03:16:09 She's good at drawing.
03:16:11 All her art is like she would draw like,
03:16:15 she's doing like,
03:16:17 what's the word I'm looking for?
03:16:19 Animated.
03:16:21 Kind of like static character art.
03:16:23 Illustrations?
03:16:25 Yeah, she's like character illustration.
03:16:27 And so like, I don't know.
03:16:29 I guess VTubing is a pretty natural
03:16:31 convergence of those two things.
03:16:33 But I haven't seen any of it.
03:16:35 That's interesting.
03:16:37 It's really good.
03:16:39 Yeah.
03:16:41 I wonder, I would just want to know
03:16:43 if Roshmar is related to Remlazar.
03:16:45 Remlazar, yeah.
03:16:47 You know what I'm talking about?
03:16:49 Yes.
03:16:51 Red letter media? Okay.
03:16:53 Is Remlazar related to Eliazar?
03:16:55 Yeah, basically.
03:16:57 You tell me.
03:16:59 I'm connecting the dots here.
03:17:01 Next one is,
03:17:03 it's called,
03:17:05 wait, we didn't listen to the last one.
03:17:07 Sorry, the last one is called.
03:17:09 There's no reason to do that.
03:17:11 The last one is called Digi Bro.
03:17:13 No, we got to listen to it.
03:17:15 Three, two, one, go.
03:17:17 Yeah.
03:17:19 I told you.
03:17:21 Eliazar cut that out.
03:17:23 Eliazar? Eliazar?
03:17:25 Yeah.
03:17:27 Eliazar? I just did an even better burp.
03:17:29 Enjoy yourself.
03:17:31 I've been burping this whole podcast.
03:17:33 There's nothing special about it.
03:17:35 You're a baby, Ben. I know.
03:17:37 I spit up a little bit.
03:17:39 I spit up a little bit.
03:17:41 When I burp, it will puke a little bit.
03:17:43 That's okay.
03:17:45 Next voicemail is called
03:17:47 nose. Three, two, one, go.
03:17:53 Why?
03:17:55 Why send this?
03:17:57 They just like breathe with their nose.
03:17:59 Why make this?
03:18:01 Why make this?
03:18:03 Why do this?
03:18:05 Next voicemail is called OVA.
03:18:07 Three, two, one, go.
03:18:09 So when's the OVA
03:18:11 supposed to release?
03:18:13 Yeah.
03:18:15 Last time.
03:18:17 Yeah.
03:18:19 The answer is the footage.
03:18:21 Nate has the footage.
03:18:23 I said they're working on it.
03:18:25 So I don't know.
03:18:27 I asked him
03:18:29 not long ago.
03:18:31 He told me.
03:18:33 He told me at Christmas
03:18:35 that he was going to make it before
03:18:37 he was going to make the
03:18:39 not the OVA, but the
03:18:41 Brad Garling House
03:18:43 music video.
03:18:45 He said it wouldn't take him long.
03:18:47 He was going to take a day and do that before New Year's.
03:18:49 He didn't do it, but I asked him again
03:18:51 like a week ago or something
03:18:53 and he said, okay.
03:18:55 I told him, you know,
03:18:57 Kaiju has taken up
03:18:59 the dojin job.
03:19:01 And so that's only a few weeks away.
03:19:03 And I told him like,
03:19:05 Nate, I would really,
03:19:07 it would be really good if we could have
03:19:09 the Brad Garling House music video
03:19:11 and the OVA
03:19:13 at the same time as that.
03:19:15 So can we have that in a few weeks?
03:19:17 And he said, yes, he'll do it.
03:19:19 So supposedly he's going to do it.
03:19:21 Have you ever heard of this little thing called
03:19:23 personal fucking responsibility?
03:19:25 Right, exactly.
03:19:27 Yeah.
03:19:29 If Nate doesn't deliver on time,
03:19:31 just message him and be like, God, Nate,
03:19:33 it's not being such a tricksy.
03:19:35 I mean, it's too late to deliver on time,
03:19:37 anything, but I mean,
03:19:39 it's...
03:19:41 I'm sure he intends to do it.
03:19:43 I just,
03:19:45 I hope he does.
03:19:47 I hope I don't have to hound him
03:19:49 too many times.
03:19:51 Because he says he'll do it.
03:19:53 And I,
03:19:55 even as of recently,
03:19:57 I said, are you going to do it?
03:19:59 And he said, yes, I will do it
03:20:01 soon.
03:20:03 So, you know,
03:20:05 I don't know.
03:20:07 Next voicemail is called...
03:20:09 What is it?
03:20:11 That was OVA.
03:20:13 Next voicemail is called sorry.
03:20:15 Here it is.
03:20:17 Okay, three, two, one, go.
03:20:21 Why?
03:20:23 God, not number one. Why?
03:20:26 This voicemail just wants the voicemail segment to end.
03:20:29 The voicemail segment's died.
03:20:31 It reminds me of song one.
03:20:33 Trying to communicate. I'm going to breathe with my nose
03:20:35 until I make a smoke signal.
03:20:37 Why do this to me?
03:20:39 Why would you hurt me like this?
03:20:41 What did I do to you
03:20:43 to deserve this treatment?
03:20:45 What did we do then?
03:20:47 Next voicemail is called
03:20:49 what have I done?
03:20:51 Three, two, one, go.
03:20:53 The same guy.
03:20:55 Why would you click on it?
03:21:01 So quiet.
03:21:03 That was pretty good.
03:21:05 I guess.
03:21:07 The loud what have I done.
03:21:09 I could do something.
03:21:11 Okay, next one is...
03:21:13 Okay, it's just a question. It's a text question.
03:21:15 It's Riley Bird Mint.
03:21:17 Where did these people come from?
03:21:19 Answer their dick show people.
03:21:21 I don't know.
03:21:23 Next one is...
03:21:25 What did you see?
03:21:27 When two people love each other.
03:21:29 They met a burning dick.
03:21:31 That's the answer.
03:21:33 Next one is called...
03:21:35 Oh god, okay.
03:21:37 X zero.
03:21:39 The hour of reprisal.
03:21:41 This is what it's all been building to.
03:21:43 Okay.
03:21:45 Three, two, one, go.
03:21:47 He...
03:21:49 Has...
03:21:51 Come... Jesus.
03:21:53 I knew it.
03:21:55 Hello.
03:21:57 Hi, Samurai-sama.
03:21:59 You expect...
03:22:01 Anybody else?
03:22:03 Fuck off.
03:22:05 Samurai-sama.
03:22:07 Come to say...
03:22:09 Two things.
03:22:11 Number one.
03:22:13 Fuck off.
03:22:15 That's right.
03:22:17 And number two.
03:22:19 Episode 300.
03:22:23 Episode 300.
03:22:25 I know, right?
03:22:27 What the fuck?
03:22:29 I know, right?
03:22:31 Yeah. That's probably true.
03:22:47 Yeah.
03:22:49 That's probably true.
03:22:57 Right.
03:22:59 Okay. Until next time.
03:23:02 Goodbye.
03:23:04 Love you, Samurai.
03:23:06 I knew he was going to come back.
03:23:08 He's right.
03:23:10 I just...
03:23:12 I accept it.
03:23:13 I accept. 300 episodes is cringe.
03:23:16 There's just no getting around it.
03:23:18 Curingy.
03:23:20 Fuck off.
03:23:22 What do you even want to become Curingy?
03:23:25 Okay.
03:23:27 Lovely to hear.
03:23:29 Lovely to hear from the Samurai again.
03:23:32 Okay.
03:23:35 The procrastinator's podcast political compass.
03:23:39 Me too.
03:23:41 Oh, hey. They placed me pretty accurately.
03:23:45 They actually put me pretty accurate to where my actual political compass is.
03:23:49 That's Fidium C or Kimster?
03:23:52 That's...
03:23:54 That's Fidium C.
03:23:56 Okay.
03:23:58 No, that's Fidium C with the beard.
03:24:00 The Wonder Bread guy is up there.
03:24:04 Why am I authoritarian left?
03:24:08 Why is Cheesy authoritarian left?
03:24:10 Why is Kazzy authoritarian left?
03:24:12 I don't know if this makes any sense.
03:24:14 Cheesy is authoritarian left because he holds a gun to begata's head
03:24:17 and he says you're going to redistribute the retweets around.
03:24:22 And God bless him for it.
03:24:25 What's the second with Megaman supposed to be?
03:24:28 Oh, that's to Snaker.
03:24:32 That's from the animation of Meta Knight on his period that I heard about.
03:24:37 Uh, no.
03:24:41 Who is that red blob on the right?
03:24:47 Oh, it's Shreddit.
03:24:49 Yeah, it's Shreddit.
03:24:51 Uh, I don't know.
03:24:53 This is silly.
03:24:55 I don't know if I have anything to say about it.
03:24:57 It's sort of in the right ballpark, but with all alignment charts
03:25:05 that have a fixed number of spaces but way too many people,
03:25:10 they can't actually fit them properly.
03:25:13 Why is Maryweather far left?
03:25:16 What's the explanation for that?
03:25:18 Has Maryweather been on the podcast? I just missed that.
03:25:21 Yeah, he's been on like three times.
03:25:23 He's been on at least twice.
03:25:25 Once as a VTuber.
03:25:27 That's right. That's right.
03:25:29 Marydog.
03:25:31 What was the editing process like?
03:25:33 Did they just give you like a green screen footage to put on at Eleazar?
03:25:36 Yep.
03:25:37 Yep, exactly.
03:25:39 There's unhoxtable right leading.
03:25:41 I don't think so.
03:25:43 I think at a certain point, I'll put the people roughly where I know they are
03:25:47 and for everyone else, I just have to find room.
03:25:49 Because they can't overlap us with how I've set it up.
03:25:53 Yeah, exactly.
03:25:55 They're just going out their ass, I guess.
03:25:57 Victor is a big right-leaning centrist.
03:26:03 Davoo.
03:26:05 I guess Davoo has moved left a bit.
03:26:10 Davoo finally realized that Trump bad like a few months ago.
03:26:14 Good for her.
03:26:16 Congratulations.
03:26:18 Did you not know that he's trying to do a coup?
03:26:22 She, I don't know.
03:26:24 She saw some, she made some stupid posts about it.
03:26:27 Like who cares?
03:26:29 I mean, orange meant bad.
03:26:31 How hard is it to understand?
03:26:34 It was like earlier this year.
03:26:36 It might have been before the insurrection or whatever you want to call it.
03:26:41 No, it was, I don't know.
03:26:44 She made like seven tweets about it in a row.
03:26:49 It was a big thread.
03:26:50 It was just like rambling.
03:26:51 I don't even remember what the point was.
03:26:52 Orange meant bad.
03:26:54 Orange meant bad.
03:26:55 Orange got good.
03:26:57 Yes, orange cat is good.
03:26:59 I don't know.
03:27:01 I don't know what to think about the use of my picture in this is.
03:27:05 Because on the one hand, it doesn't look like me anymore.
03:27:09 But it is one of the better facial hairstyles I had.
03:27:13 I do think that was like people like that.
03:27:16 What about the starfish beard from those early Patreon videos you made?
03:27:21 That was stupid.
03:27:22 That was me having too much and being like silly.
03:27:26 I'm glad I don't have the beard feeling on my face.
03:27:29 I guess it does look good though.
03:27:32 I just thought it was really funny.
03:27:34 I remember I showed my sister, my older sister, your videos and we were laughing so much.
03:27:39 We laughed at you.
03:27:41 We laughed at your spam.
03:27:43 We thought you were just a real funny bean.
03:27:45 And then you'll never guess what this person looks like.
03:27:48 And I pulled up those videos and we were just like, oh my God, giga-chad energy.
03:27:52 Holy fuck.
03:27:53 We loved it.
03:27:54 We loved the crazy hair.
03:27:56 It was so good.
03:27:58 You did not look like I envisioned you.
03:28:02 When I first heard your voice, Gib, I envisioned a person much different.
03:28:08 I envisioned like a chubby Swedish guy.
03:28:13 Like a big chubby blonde guy is what I thought you looked like.
03:28:18 I don't know why.
03:28:20 I don't know why.
03:28:21 I don't know.
03:28:22 That's weird.
03:28:23 Do I have a voice?
03:28:24 Of course they look like this.
03:28:25 I don't know.
03:28:26 Or did I have a voice?
03:28:28 I can't imagine why you would think that.
03:28:30 I don't know.
03:28:31 I also don't know why.
03:28:33 You just sounded like you do now.
03:28:34 Just a little more British.
03:28:36 Basically.
03:28:38 I guess you'll never know where Cittor and I are placed.
03:28:43 You got to place yourself.
03:28:44 You got to place yourself.
03:28:45 No, no, no.
03:28:46 No one will learn.
03:28:47 There's only a few spots left and they're mostly on the- they're all on the right.
03:28:50 You've got to go somewhere.
03:28:51 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:28:52 There's only- yep.
03:28:53 You're locked in.
03:28:54 Sorry.
03:28:55 No, you just can't.
03:28:56 Elisa only believes in peace and love.
03:28:59 And I for one agree.
03:29:01 Not.
03:29:02 I for one believe that good things are good and bad things are bad.
03:29:08 I believe in peace and love.
03:29:10 Accepts what it's been saying.
03:29:12 My politics are that we should support good things and oppose bad things.
03:29:18 What the fuck?
03:29:20 Controversial.
03:29:21 Next one is called, remember Paul Joseph Watson?
03:29:24 No.
03:29:25 Three, two, one, go.
03:29:28 Yo, remember when Paul Joseph Watson said, conservativeism is the new counterculture?
03:29:34 Yeah.
03:29:35 And I believe them.
03:29:36 How cringe was that?
03:29:37 Pretty funny.
03:29:38 That's pretty cringe.
03:29:39 I only know Paul Joseph Watson.
03:29:42 He wasn't the only one.
03:29:43 He wasn't the only one.
03:29:44 Reaction videos.
03:29:45 He wasn't the only one to say that.
03:29:46 His services are against like near-lib, but like it's not like counterculture because
03:29:50 it's also like the backbone of the dominant culture.
03:29:52 Everything the current culture is built upon, it has like conservative undertones.
03:29:57 There's really nothing less punk rock than like being like we should like make gay marriage
03:30:06 illegal.
03:30:07 We should keep the status quo.
03:30:10 People should have less rights.
03:30:12 Women should have more of their bodies.
03:30:16 Let me show you my political alignment.
03:30:19 It's this game.
03:30:20 This gives my political alignment.
03:30:22 Is that Ringo?
03:30:23 That's Ringo.
03:30:24 Look at him.
03:30:26 Ringo star.
03:30:27 Look at him.
03:30:28 Now, here's a guy who lived long enough to become cringe.
03:30:32 I guess he was always cringe, actually.
03:30:34 Nah, he was never cringe.
03:30:35 Shut the fuck up.
03:30:36 Ringo?
03:30:37 Nobody likes Ringo.
03:30:39 Shut up.
03:30:40 Underrated Best Beatle.
03:30:43 Patrick Star from SpongeBob saying, Ringo randomly.
03:30:48 I don't know what episode it was and it's haunted me for like five years.
03:30:52 I just had this memory and I don't know what episode it's from and I don't want to watch
03:30:55 it.
03:30:56 Someone tell me.
03:30:57 Why would you ever watch SpongeBob?
03:30:59 Did Patrick Star say Ringo?
03:31:01 SpongeBob is good.
03:31:02 It's a love SpongeBob.
03:31:03 What do you say?
03:31:04 Once upon a time, been people with children?
03:31:07 False.
03:31:08 Dude, the original free season of SpongeBob, hold up.
03:31:11 It's still really fucking funny, but the rest is meh.
03:31:16 The next one is a vocaru.
03:31:21 What's it called?
03:31:22 I don't know.
03:31:23 Three, two, one, go.
03:31:24 It's time for Ben Sings the Ripes of the Week.
03:31:32 Pretty good.
03:31:33 Pretty good jingle.
03:31:34 I'd use it.
03:31:35 I'd use it for a segment.
03:31:37 I didn't have any gripes this week other than that I aim hungover.
03:31:40 That's my gripe for the week.
03:31:41 Your gripe is that you drank alcohol and you shouldn't have.
03:31:44 You should have had the tap water.
03:31:46 I simply should have drank the tap water, but I didn't want people to know that I am immortal.
03:31:52 You didn't want the brain parasites.
03:31:54 No.
03:31:55 I didn't want the fluoride.
03:31:57 I didn't want to control my mind through the fluoride.
03:31:59 Fluoride.
03:32:00 They put fucking chlorine in America.
03:32:02 It's really gross.
03:32:03 Chlorine?
03:32:04 At least, at least, unless it's just a Texas thing.
03:32:09 The water here tastes like chlorine.
03:32:10 It tastes like pool water and it smells too.
03:32:12 When you take a shower, it smells like the fucking pool.
03:32:16 Mine doesn't smell like that.
03:32:18 I guess you got fluoride and we got chlorine.
03:32:21 I prefer fluoride.
03:32:22 It doesn't stink and you can't taste it nearly as much anyway.
03:32:27 I mean, no, I can't taste the fluoride.
03:32:31 Here's something.
03:32:33 What is this?
03:32:34 Good thumbnail.
03:32:35 I saw this thumbnail and title combination and it made me laugh for some reason, wanted to share.
03:32:40 Agitation in the Hairless Chimp Group.
03:32:43 It took me a moment to realize that is actually a Hairless Chimp.
03:32:48 It's noisy again at the chimp enclosure.
03:32:51 They're getting introduced to the remaining chimps.
03:32:54 These guys are, they're so ripped.
03:32:57 It's just because of the lack of hair.
03:32:59 They're usually ripped, but this guy is so fucking jacked.
03:33:04 I'm not on Twitter and I don't use Twitter.
03:33:06 And every time someone mentions Twitter, this is what I imagine.
03:33:09 Agitation in the Hairless Chimp Group.
03:33:12 Getting agitated.
03:33:14 That's me.
03:33:15 I'm getting agitated.
03:33:16 I'm a Hairless Chimp getting agitated.
03:33:18 Dude, the Hairless Chimp Group is like a great name for a band.
03:33:21 Yeah.
03:33:22 All right.
03:33:24 Good stuff.
03:33:25 Good stuff, I guess.
03:33:26 Next one is called Addressing the Future of Kyle and Funny Man in Space.
03:33:34 Three, two, one, go.
03:33:39 Hello.
03:33:40 This is me, Mr. Funny Man from The Iconic Show,
03:33:44 Kyle and Funny Man in Space.
03:33:46 Yes.
03:33:47 I love Kyle and Funny Man.
03:33:49 I'm just here to address the future of Kyle and Funny Man.
03:33:52 I love content.
03:33:53 I've been getting a lot of comments from people.
03:33:56 I love intellectual crap.
03:33:57 They're saying the show is too dark.
03:33:59 The people on the PCP podcast last episode, they said,
03:34:04 they started crying, they started shitting themselves.
03:34:07 They, you know, a lot of people have said they're suffering from depression now,
03:34:11 anxiety, my full disorder, or any...
03:34:15 Irritable bowel syndrome.
03:34:17 How dare you not make me shit myself?
03:34:19 The crazy argument that Kyle and Funny Man did,
03:34:23 as well as that time when Funny Man actually killed the man with a gun.
03:34:27 So we hear you.
03:34:29 The show has been getting a bit too dark.
03:34:31 So we're going to course correct with the next episode.
03:34:36 Get excited for that.
03:34:39 It's going to be the mid-season finale,
03:34:43 and it's probably going to be like five minutes.
03:34:45 So get excited for next week.
03:34:47 I guess we'll have to have more than 300 episodes.
03:34:52 Yes.
03:34:54 You know what I like about this is that it's a character from the show
03:34:59 giving a press conference.
03:35:01 Is that Funny Man?
03:35:03 That was Funny Man.
03:35:05 Well, I didn't laugh for once.
03:35:08 You're not supposed to...
03:35:10 This is serious business.
03:35:12 We're talking about the future of the IP.
03:35:15 IP?
03:35:16 There's money on the line.
03:35:18 That's funny.
03:35:20 You know what? It is funny.
03:35:22 Funny Man, you did it again.
03:35:25 Another masterpiece.
03:35:28 He really is the funniest man ever.
03:35:30 Yeah, that mad man.
03:35:35 Next voicemail.
03:35:38 Where is this?
03:35:39 Okay, the next one is called both Imgir and Voice.
03:35:44 So here's the voice clip,
03:35:47 and here's the Imgir link for the accompanying image, I guess.
03:35:57 Okay, oh god.
03:35:59 All right, let's give it a listen in three, two, one, go.
03:36:05 Attention, attention.
03:36:07 All the music in this voicemail is copyright free.
03:36:11 No need to mute it.
03:36:13 Thank you for your attention.
03:36:15 Hello there, this is me, Jay.
03:36:18 You might remember me, you might not,
03:36:21 but you will remember to repost my card book.
03:36:26 Or else...
03:36:28 I will mint it.
03:36:30 I'm having...
03:36:31 I will mint it all.
03:36:32 Slime and punishment, blue face,
03:36:35 even then does what itself,
03:36:38 and then when the climate change comes,
03:36:41 and humanity ends,
03:36:43 everyone will remember,
03:36:45 when same as the Imgir of the...
03:36:53 Having a little trouble understanding...
03:36:56 Yeah, I understand one word from that.
03:36:58 I heard Slime and Punishment, and Harbinger.
03:37:01 Ben St. the Imgir of Dave.
03:37:05 Notice that.
03:37:06 Like in Phantom, that's the...
03:37:07 Yeah, I was about to say.
03:37:09 I like that they're being crucified.
03:37:11 That makes me smile.
03:37:13 Hard voicemail, but the image is great, I love it.
03:37:15 Yeah.
03:37:16 The image is very good.
03:37:19 Ben will make the blue race.
03:37:23 Is that Slime?
03:37:24 Is that like an ocean of Slime behind them?
03:37:26 Looks like it.
03:37:27 I'm gonna say it is, yeah.
03:37:29 It's kinda now.
03:37:32 What?
03:37:33 What?
03:37:34 What?
03:37:35 What?
03:37:36 Okay, next voicemail.
03:37:38 There it is.
03:37:39 It's called...
03:37:42 Backwards Message.
03:37:44 Three, two, one, go.
03:37:46 Erklaas kak yezee tnees neb.
03:37:50 Skak nekas knyal ya tnees neb.
03:37:55 Ze amin nyam.
03:37:58 Sounds like oblivion.
03:38:00 Definitely oblivion.
03:38:01 I wonder why it sounds like me.
03:38:04 Oblivion.
03:38:05 Let's see the next voicemail.
03:38:06 Do you want to translate for us?
03:38:08 The next voicemail.
03:38:10 Just do the next one.
03:38:12 How many more are out there?
03:38:14 We're on the last page.
03:38:16 There's only maybe 10 or 15 left?
03:38:20 10.
03:38:21 Yeah, we kinda got a lot this week.
03:38:24 Oblivion, I never told you how much I love
03:38:27 when I was editing the episode and the fucking...
03:38:30 Oh, put the baby in a blender.
03:38:32 The fucking stuff.
03:38:34 Oh, put the baby in a blender.
03:38:36 The baby in a blender.
03:38:38 No, you want to.
03:38:40 You need to.
03:38:42 The next one is called...
03:38:46 S-A-G-S-M-S-D-R-O-C-C-A-B.
03:38:49 Three, two, one, go.
03:38:51 My name is Ben St.
03:38:55 I like sucking cock.
03:38:58 No!
03:38:59 Ben St. is a cock sucker.
03:39:02 How did you get this secret recording of me saying that?
03:39:07 I knew that the word cock was in there
03:39:10 because it sounds the same in backwards.
03:39:13 Yeah, cock.
03:39:14 I was struggling to say cock backwards,
03:39:16 and then I realized just say cock.
03:39:18 Yeah.
03:39:23 Yeah, I really did.
03:39:24 I really did say it backwards and then reverse it.
03:39:27 It was a little fun, but if you do it one syllable at a time,
03:39:30 it's easy.
03:39:31 You can't...
03:39:32 It's not like Yvonne at Nia's.
03:39:35 You can't just read.
03:39:36 You can't just write it backwards and then read it phonetically.
03:39:40 What I did is I recorded myself saying it,
03:39:42 and then I reversed the recording,
03:39:44 listened to each syllable,
03:39:46 every two syllables one at a time,
03:39:48 and just recorded myself just saying those parts
03:39:50 and putting them together.
03:39:51 That makes sense.
03:39:52 Think that's what I did in 10 minutes.
03:39:54 For Twin Peaks.
03:39:55 Yeah.
03:39:56 Yeah, Twin Peaks did that.
03:39:58 Wait, wait.
03:39:59 Didn't you retire?
03:40:01 This took me like 10 minutes to see it all.
03:40:03 It was fine.
03:40:04 10 minutes.
03:40:06 Who has time for that?
03:40:09 I need satanic messaging is so important.
03:40:12 Yeah, in your music, not in the PCK.
03:40:15 Nothing more satanic than Ben saying,
03:40:16 suckin' a big cock, dude.
03:40:19 I like the medium size.
03:40:22 Regular cock, please.
03:40:25 Next average.
03:40:27 I wanted to sit right on top of that bell curve.
03:40:30 Ben, that's my cock you're describing right now.
03:40:35 It's most cock.
03:40:38 Exactly six inches.
03:40:40 Wait a minute.
03:40:41 No more, no less.
03:40:42 I'm average.
03:40:45 Next voicemail is called,
03:40:47 Newer fan wants lore, please.
03:40:50 Three, two, one, go.
03:40:52 So inspired by last week's
03:40:55 newer PCP fan asking about
03:40:58 Prince Isolation asking about
03:41:00 Colt Corona, Hilarious.
03:41:02 Questions about lore as a newer PCP fan myself.
03:41:06 So I'm a fan of the comic,
03:41:09 Slam and Punishment, I think it's good.
03:41:12 And I get pretty much everything that's going on there.
03:41:14 With the exception of strawberry milk.
03:41:18 Who is strawberry milk?
03:41:20 What's the deal with strawberry milk?
03:41:22 What is strawberry milk?
03:41:24 Give me some lore on that dragon looking boy.
03:41:28 Sure, fair.
03:41:30 Strawberry milk was Munchie's MLP Sona.
03:41:36 Use a dragon.
03:41:38 Yeah, that's it.
03:41:39 It was cool.
03:41:40 I had Phantom horn, Nate had keg standard,
03:41:42 Munchie had strawberry milk.
03:41:44 He never made any videos with strawberry milk,
03:41:46 although he is in the RFCK episodes
03:41:51 where we talk about brony shit.
03:41:53 Phantom and strawberry.
03:41:55 So he's kind of...
03:41:57 He's also kind of RFCK.
03:41:59 Didn't he make strawberry milk for something like that?
03:42:03 No, he had strawberry milk.
03:42:05 Strawberry milk was his Sona even back in
03:42:07 at BronyCon, back in the day.
03:42:10 I saw some doodles of him.
03:42:13 He looks like Spike the Dragon plus Steven Universe.
03:42:17 Basically.
03:42:19 Yeah.
03:42:21 I made him big.
03:42:24 Because, I don't know.
03:42:26 He changed the design.
03:42:28 Originally, he looked much more like Spike the Dragon,
03:42:31 but I think he changed the design to be taller.
03:42:34 So this is the redesign version.
03:42:36 My version of strawberry milk is not faithful.
03:42:39 I basically fucked up and I wrote him wrong.
03:42:42 My version is not faithful.
03:42:44 The real strawberry milk is just a rapist
03:42:46 and a sexual predator.
03:42:48 It's just kind of like a funny bro who likes sex.
03:42:51 I soften the character a lot.
03:42:55 Munchie hates sex.
03:42:57 Yeah, Munchie hates sex, but strawberry milk
03:43:01 likes it to a criminal degree.
03:43:04 It's canon.
03:43:06 It's canon.
03:43:08 But not in Slime's Munchie.
03:43:11 Pledge to the PCP.
03:43:13 Listen to the fucking Five Nights at Freddy's versus...
03:43:16 Chucky Cheese.
03:43:18 Chucky Cheese.
03:43:20 Munchie's 20-minute long rant in that thing
03:43:22 is one of my favorite things ever.
03:43:24 Oh my god.
03:43:26 Do you want to know a funny story about that?
03:43:30 You know what?
03:43:32 My then-girlfriend was on that bonus episode.
03:43:35 And she was really excited to just talk genuinely
03:43:38 about Chucky Cheese.
03:43:40 And she was mad.
03:43:42 She was angry afterwards.
03:43:44 She was angry that Munchie had talked too much.
03:43:48 I wanted to explain the history of Chucky Cheese
03:43:52 because I watched a documentary about it.
03:43:54 She was mad for a while.
03:43:56 She did get to explain it.
03:43:58 She explained it very well and it was interesting.
03:44:00 She did, but she was still mad.
03:44:02 I thought she did a good job.
03:44:04 She was mad.
03:44:06 She succeeded though.
03:44:08 I learned a lot and I thought it was cool stuff.
03:44:10 She was so shallow by Munchie.
03:44:12 I thought it was funny.
03:44:14 She did not appreciate it.
03:44:16 You know what?
03:44:18 There's a reason things didn't work out between us.
03:44:20 I'm going to fucking...
03:44:22 One day, one of my goals before I die
03:44:24 is to animate that rant.
03:44:26 I just have to do it.
03:44:28 It's so good.
03:44:30 400 episodes.
03:44:32 I remember in the moment
03:44:34 thinking that the rant was pretty funny
03:44:36 but also being very uncomfortable
03:44:38 because I could tell she was starting to see.
03:44:40 She was sitting right next to me
03:44:42 and I was like, oh, no.
03:44:44 Oh, dear.
03:44:46 I don't know what to do about this.
03:44:48 Oh, no.
03:44:50 Yeah.
03:44:52 I kind of remember what happened.
03:44:54 I think I was losing my breath laughing.
03:44:56 I remember him launching into
03:44:58 this diet ride.
03:45:00 This huge thing.
03:45:02 It just went on.
03:45:04 It just kept going.
03:45:06 Munchie's rant about the alternate world history
03:45:08 of the atomic bomb landing on a mouse
03:45:10 and creating the ultimate Adonis
03:45:12 who is the crust of the earth itself.
03:45:14 That is almost on the level
03:45:16 of the story that I told in English class
03:45:18 for my speech.
03:45:20 Oh, the one that was just steamed hams.
03:45:22 No, not the steamed hams.
03:45:24 It's just a speech about time travel
03:45:26 and the dinosaur is being wiped out
03:45:28 by these free-legged creatures.
03:45:30 Chuck E. Cheese is my godfather.
03:45:32 He's my father, but we call him a god.
03:45:34 Somebody should...
03:45:36 Look into his eyes. There is no lust.
03:45:38 That was so good.
03:45:40 Man, yeah.
03:45:42 I haven't thought about that in a while, but that was great.
03:45:44 Pledge to the PCP Patreon.
03:45:46 Bonus episodes.
03:45:48 He's my father, but he's so powerful
03:45:50 we call him a god.
03:45:52 It's amazing.
03:45:54 Honestly, I don't...
03:45:56 I forget most of the details.
03:45:58 I could go back and listen and refresh myself.
03:46:02 It's fucking funny.
03:46:04 I have a condensed version of the rant
03:46:06 where I cut out all the fluff
03:46:08 and cut out as much of Jackie as I could.
03:46:12 Alright, next voicemail.
03:46:14 It's called...
03:46:16 It's just called voicemail.
03:46:18 There it is.
03:46:20 Three, two, one, go.
03:46:26 Perfect.
03:46:30 A lot of just bodily sounds today.
03:46:32 A lot of burps.
03:46:34 This one's really...
03:46:36 These are not mine.
03:46:38 That is not mine.
03:46:40 That sounds like your...
03:46:42 This is because I'm the only fucking person
03:46:44 who puts a rasp in my voice sometimes.
03:46:46 You hear any rasp when you think it's me.
03:46:48 He just can't quit.
03:46:50 He said he wouldn't do it anymore,
03:46:52 but he can't break the habit
03:46:54 and now he just calls the voicemail
03:46:56 and just sits on the phone
03:46:58 and just breathing into the microphone.
03:47:00 I hear all the time.
03:47:02 When you thought it's over,
03:47:04 there was the force in everything.
03:47:06 I'm not even posting most of them.
03:47:08 I've cut out so many of them that are just oblivion falls.
03:47:10 Heavy breathing.
03:47:12 Hold on, let me try and go...
03:47:14 It's exactly the same.
03:47:16 It is.
03:47:18 It's the same. It's a match. We have a match.
03:47:20 Computer enhanced.
03:47:22 That one generally wasn't me
03:47:24 about what I was saying.
03:47:26 It's over.
03:47:28 It's as easy as a broadcast.
03:47:30 Sorry.
03:47:32 Your time in the League of Natefuckers.
03:47:34 You've been forcibly expelled from the League of Natefuckers.
03:47:36 No, I built that with my own hands.
03:47:38 No, you've been usurped.
03:47:40 You're fired. You're destroyed.
03:47:42 I mean, the League is cutting off your payments.
03:47:44 The next voicemail
03:47:46 is called Trixie.
03:47:48 Three, two, one, go.
03:47:52 It just doesn't quit.
03:47:54 They just won't quit.
03:47:56 Next voicemail
03:47:58 is called
03:48:00 3, 2, 1, go.
03:48:02 I don't know what this is.
03:48:04 Attack on Titan?
03:48:08 It's what?
03:48:10 It's what?
03:48:12 Just it's.
03:48:14 Attack on Titan is...
03:48:16 Wait, there's another one.
03:48:18 This one is also called
03:48:20 3, 2, 1, go.
03:48:22 Good.
03:48:24 No, bad.
03:48:26 Okay.
03:48:28 People were saying I should...
03:48:30 I've heard that Attack on Titan gets bad.
03:48:32 A couple people on Twitter were telling me
03:48:34 no, it's actually fine
03:48:36 and you should read it and maybe I will
03:48:38 read it at some point.
03:48:40 Dude, there's just some fucking great
03:48:42 art every so often.
03:48:44 Some giant funny skeleton creatures
03:48:46 that are cool.
03:48:48 Yeah.
03:48:50 I mean, I like that it
03:48:52 has an ending.
03:48:54 The fact that it has an ending makes me
03:48:56 like, I appreciate that. I should finish it
03:48:58 just in honor of the fact that it had the courage
03:49:00 to end. Good for it.
03:49:02 I appreciate it.
03:49:04 Next one is called
03:49:06 OPM
03:49:08 is 13 years old, by the way.
03:49:10 3, 2, 1, go.
03:49:14 One punch man has become shit, too.
03:49:16 Don't read the manga
03:49:18 even though it looks awesome.
03:49:20 You read it anyway to look at the pictures.
03:49:22 Look at the pretty pictures
03:49:24 and read the webcomic for the awesome story.
03:49:26 That's what I've heard from my friend Fade
03:49:28 all up.
03:49:30 The manga
03:49:34 with the nice art
03:49:36 started adding on all this stuff
03:49:38 like a tournament arc and a bunch of other shit
03:49:40 that apparently is just really boring
03:49:42 shown and stuff apparently.
03:49:44 That's really dumb.
03:49:46 That's what I've heard.
03:49:48 I don't like it. I feel like the point of it
03:49:50 should have been to adapt
03:49:52 one's story.
03:49:54 I've totally lost patience
03:49:56 with tropes
03:49:58 like that.
03:50:00 Tropes.
03:50:02 Fucking tropes.
03:50:04 The tournament arc is like every single
03:50:06 thing has it. I've seen it.
03:50:08 It's the laziest way to make
03:50:10 fights happen.
03:50:12 You could totally make a good
03:50:14 tournament arc in a good way.
03:50:16 Tournament arcs are only good
03:50:18 in D&D where you're the DM
03:50:20 and you don't want to have
03:50:22 to do any work.
03:50:24 That's where they...
03:50:26 I want a story where there's a tournament
03:50:28 going on and the characters in the
03:50:30 show they go and watch it
03:50:32 and they're in the crowd. It's like, oh fuck
03:50:34 well that was fun. Let's go home.
03:50:36 I can't believe it's still
03:50:38 going after 13 years.
03:50:40 Where does that...
03:50:42 I don't have to read it to find out, but where does
03:50:44 that story go?
03:50:46 I can't even imagine.
03:50:48 The theme is that it's one punch
03:50:50 and he doesn't care
03:50:52 about life.
03:50:54 He doesn't care about combat
03:50:56 but he's really good at it. He cares about
03:50:58 other things.
03:51:00 That doesn't really have a concrete
03:51:02 ending
03:51:04 unless he stops
03:51:06 punching.
03:51:08 I read the part where the
03:51:10 alien comes
03:51:12 because he's seeking
03:51:14 the most powerful opponent or whatever.
03:51:16 He's the most powerful alien.
03:51:18 That's what I read up to.
03:51:20 And I felt thematically
03:51:22 that was like, yep, this is the thematic
03:51:24 conclusion to this whole
03:51:26 conceit of this story.
03:51:28 Makes sense. And that's where season one ends
03:51:30 which is the season with the really good animation
03:51:32 that's worth watching IMO.
03:51:34 So I can't even...
03:51:36 I can't even imagine where it goes in there
03:51:38 and I guess I shouldn't write it off without
03:51:40 reading it. I don't know, maybe it's so good.
03:51:42 His arm gets cut off and he can't punch
03:51:44 so he becomes one kick man.
03:51:46 No, he gets...
03:51:48 Everything removed except one finger
03:51:50 and one arm and he's one flick man.
03:51:52 He loses an arm
03:51:54 so he becomes literally one punch man
03:51:56 because he's...
03:51:58 He can only punch once.
03:52:00 Then he becomes fruit tropical punch man.
03:52:04 Hawaiian punch man.
03:52:06 Maybe he meets the red, like that guy
03:52:08 you know, the guy with the red hat
03:52:10 or whatever, or is it a snail?
03:52:12 No, the Hawaiian punch guy.
03:52:14 I don't know who he is.
03:52:16 The guy who punches people.
03:52:18 Uh, hold on.
03:52:20 Oh, I just finished another
03:52:22 in-between session from animations.
03:52:24 I've been working on this whole thing and I just finished. Hell yeah.
03:52:26 Here, here, here.
03:52:28 This...
03:52:30 This fucking guy
03:52:32 who...
03:52:34 I don't even know what he's supposed to be.
03:52:36 That's a cool hat.
03:52:38 You know this guy?
03:52:40 I think it's a hat.
03:52:42 This guy looks like he doesn't follow the rules.
03:52:44 I don't trust him.
03:52:46 There's seven kinds of fruit in Hawaiian punch.
03:52:48 Dude.
03:52:50 This guy's drunky.
03:52:52 He asks you, do you want a Hawaiian punch?
03:52:54 And then you say, hell yeah.
03:52:56 And then he slugs you.
03:52:58 He should be wearing a punch.
03:53:00 He beats the shit out of you.
03:53:02 That's his thing.
03:53:04 He should be wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
03:53:06 Wait a minute. Okay.
03:53:08 Okay, check this out.
03:53:10 This showed up in my search results.
03:53:12 Somebody else made the joke.
03:53:14 Somebody else made the same joke.
03:53:16 Oh.
03:53:18 Nothing's original then.
03:53:20 No, nothing new under the sun.
03:53:24 Alright, next voicemail is...
03:53:26 I think I already...
03:53:28 No, this is what it's called.
03:53:30 How is no one abusing this every week for fun?
03:53:32 Three, two, one, go.
03:53:34 What is this fucking system?
03:53:36 Can I just send a hundred voicemails right now?
03:53:38 Yeah.
03:53:40 I could send one every ten seconds.
03:53:42 I could send one every ten seconds.
03:53:44 For the rest of time.
03:53:46 It has been abused.
03:53:48 Sometime.
03:53:50 We're constantly being abused.
03:53:52 Dude, I abused the fuck out of the system
03:53:54 with the pig episode.
03:53:56 My god.
03:53:58 I got that up.
03:54:00 I ruined Ben's day.
03:54:02 I hated that episode.
03:54:04 I really, really hated it.
03:54:06 You have no idea how much
03:54:08 I was laughing listening to that episode
03:54:10 and how much I got you.
03:54:12 When I did that,
03:54:14 I just wanted to make fun of pig squealing.
03:54:16 It's a vocal method
03:54:18 in death metal.
03:54:20 Pig squealing needs to be taken down a peg.
03:54:22 It's been too high on the floor.
03:54:24 It does.
03:54:26 I didn't even do it anymore.
03:54:28 I somehow did it that one time.
03:54:30 Yeah, it was me. That was my voice.
03:54:32 I did the pig squealing noises.
03:54:34 Then I'm like, this sounds terrible.
03:54:36 What should I do with it?
03:54:38 How could I make this a voicemail?
03:54:40 I thought about it.
03:54:42 I have so many old voicemails from way back.
03:54:44 What if I just grab some of those?
03:54:46 What if I just put them in unexpectedly?
03:54:48 It's a different person every time,
03:54:50 so Ben will never expect it and he will just get jump-scared.
03:54:52 That's exactly what happens.
03:54:54 It got even better than that,
03:54:56 because I knew that Ben would eventually become wise.
03:54:58 He'd eventually realize early on,
03:55:00 wait, this person sounds like they're talking about Nate
03:55:02 or some shit from years ago.
03:55:04 Then what I did is,
03:55:06 I'll throw in a bunch of false flags.
03:55:08 I'll do three ones with the pig.
03:55:10 I'll throw in four false flags,
03:55:12 and then I'll throw in the other three.
03:55:14 The very first false flag I put in
03:55:16 was the first time you said,
03:55:18 it's the pig, isn't it?
03:55:20 And then it wasn't.
03:55:22 It was perfectly down to where you would
03:55:24 be bamboozled,
03:55:26 and then you got so fucking mad, too.
03:55:28 I think so much listening to it.
03:55:30 Mastermind.
03:55:32 I'm just like a mouse
03:55:34 running through your maze.
03:55:40 It was so fucked.
03:55:42 That is fucked.
03:55:44 I did my fake British accent
03:55:46 and Ben's like, that sounds like oblivion
03:55:48 and gib the British one.
03:55:50 No, it's too British.
03:55:58 Alright, next voicemail
03:56:00 is called 30s.
03:56:02 Three, two, one, go.
03:56:04 Oh my god, I'm leaving a voicemail
03:56:06 on the 300th episode of the PCP.
03:56:08 That's right.
03:56:10 It's all I ever wanted.
03:56:12 Same.
03:56:14 This voicemail has been brought to you
03:56:16 by your 30s.
03:56:18 I'm down hill from here.
03:56:20 Woo!
03:56:22 I'm happy
03:56:24 that I am not
03:56:26 I'm happy that I am not
03:56:28 one of these people
03:56:30 who has suffered
03:56:32 any kind of like horrible debilitation.
03:56:34 Some people are like,
03:56:36 you get 30 and then you just are in pain all the time
03:56:38 and everything starts to
03:56:40 fail. And I'm like, well,
03:56:42 it hasn't happened for me yet, so I guess
03:56:44 I'm should be pretty happy
03:56:46 about that.
03:56:48 It started hamming for me
03:56:50 in my early 20s with my fucking back.
03:56:52 This is what I get
03:56:54 for not getting drunk and hungover.
03:56:56 That's right.
03:56:58 It's good for you.
03:57:00 Yeah, it gives you exercise, makes you get out more
03:57:02 so you're not stuck sitting in a chair working constantly
03:57:04 hurting your back.
03:57:06 I still do that.
03:57:08 I still do that.
03:57:10 Okay, next one is called
03:57:12 The Chew Dynasty.
03:57:14 3, 2, 1,
03:57:16 go.
03:57:22 Nice beat.
03:57:26 There's lots of things you could imagine this being.
03:57:32 Just imagine like a little ant beatboxing.
03:57:34 Is this just going to keep going like this?
03:57:40 I'm not mentioning a little mouse
03:57:42 like you in the beatboxing.
03:57:44 I wanted to cut off and be like,
03:57:46 okay, cool. Anyway, what do you think of the new Pokemon game?
03:57:58 Just giggling at weird noises.
03:58:02 This is the procrastinator's experience.
03:58:04 He's really going for it.
03:58:12 He's really going for it.
03:58:16 He's really going to do a whole minute of this.
03:58:18 Okay.
03:58:20 Nice. Good luck.
03:58:26 Okay.
03:58:28 Is that Peter Gorfin?
03:58:30 Yeah.
03:58:32 Peter.
03:58:34 Peter.
03:58:36 You're a Peterphile.
03:58:38 Hey, Peter, I'm married to you.
03:58:40 That makes me a Peterphile.
03:58:42 They had to have made that joke.
03:58:44 I can't be the first one to make that joke.
03:58:46 A water potter?
03:58:48 This reminded me of that time when I was sus.
03:58:54 Next voicemail
03:58:56 is called...
03:58:58 Well, there's an image.
03:59:00 There's an image to go with it.
03:59:02 Let's see.
03:59:04 I'll post it. I don't know.
03:59:08 I feel like I've hit a point
03:59:10 where I've deduced all I can deduce.
03:59:12 Ben saying
03:59:14 PCP bonus episode number 43
03:59:16 at 23.
03:59:18 Okay.
03:59:20 Alright, this is from the bonus episode
03:59:22 where I was learning...
03:59:24 Gib was teaching me how to play Minesweeper.
03:59:26 I was learning.
03:59:28 I was in the process of learning.
03:59:30 That episode was so frustrating
03:59:32 to edit.
03:59:34 I'm sure it was.
03:59:36 If you know how to play.
03:59:38 I figured it out, though.
03:59:40 I figured it out.
03:59:42 I figured out how to do it.
03:59:44 I taught you how.
03:59:46 Well, yes.
03:59:48 With your help, I figured it out and I did it.
03:59:50 You can watch me expand my mind
03:59:52 in real time.
03:59:54 I'd love that episode.
03:59:56 I don't know if it was as bombastic
03:59:58 as
04:00:00 Munchie's
04:00:02 the
04:00:04 Chuck E. Cheese ramp.
04:00:06 You know how you can change the world
04:00:08 in Wordle by just changing the date
04:00:10 in your PC?
04:00:12 You could make a Wordle...
04:00:14 That was a voicemail last time.
04:00:16 You could make a Wordle competition.
04:00:18 When you finish a word, you just change the date.
04:00:20 Whoever does
04:00:22 the Wordle faster
04:00:24 wins.
04:00:26 But then I won't be able to do Wordle
04:00:28 for 10 days.
04:00:30 You'll be clean.
04:00:32 I think you would want
04:00:34 to do it in the least guesses.
04:00:36 I think you would take 10 Wordles
04:00:38 and be like, who can do
04:00:40 these 10 Wordles in the least
04:00:42 total guesses?
04:00:44 There are other sites that
04:00:46 do the same thing as Wordle,
04:00:48 but it's not one per day.
04:00:50 It's not Wordle.
04:00:52 You need the IP.
04:00:54 You need the IP.
04:00:56 Yeah, it's all about that IP.
04:00:58 Anyway, let's listen to this voicemail.
04:01:00 Three, two, one, go.
04:01:02 Ho, ho, ho!
04:01:04 I am the
04:01:06 mind-sweeper deity!
04:01:08 And I think that you are
04:01:10 bad at the game!
04:01:12 Ho, ho, ho!
04:01:14 Why is the mind-sweeper deity a goat?
04:01:16 It's a goat woman.
04:01:18 Maybe?
04:01:20 Um, is it
04:01:22 Toriel?
04:01:24 June.
04:01:26 Sex question mark?
04:01:28 Sex?
04:01:30 Yes.
04:01:32 No, I'm good at the game now.
04:01:34 I learned it.
04:01:36 Next voicemail is called a quick question.
04:01:38 There it is.
04:01:40 Okay, we're almost done, by the way.
04:01:42 We got three more.
04:01:44 Three, two, one, go.
04:01:46 Funniest compliment you ever got.
04:01:48 Go.
04:01:50 Funniest compliment?
04:01:52 Funniest compliment?
04:01:54 Someone said I was really...
04:01:56 They really liked that skitser girl
04:01:58 once on a pro and on episode.
04:02:00 And you know what?
04:02:02 They really liked that skitser girl.
04:02:04 Yeah.
04:02:06 Wait, I actually
04:02:08 do know the funniest compliment I got.
04:02:10 Let me find it.
04:02:12 The funniest compliment I ever got is
04:02:14 kiss you then kiss Paul McCartney.
04:02:18 That's pretty good.
04:02:20 I don't know if I can think of
04:02:22 like a funny, like a compliment
04:02:24 that was funny somehow.
04:02:26 I can think of compliments that were like
04:02:28 upsetting to me because it's like
04:02:30 a trait that I didn't want to have.
04:02:32 And that they liked.
04:02:34 God, I can't, I can't...
04:02:36 I can't think of any compliments
04:02:38 I got on that one.
04:02:40 It's my cat. Does that help?
04:02:42 Almost as cute.
04:02:44 I would never imply that anyone is
04:02:46 actually as cute as my pet cat.
04:02:48 My cats are very cute.
04:02:50 Almost.
04:02:52 That's a pretty high bar.
04:02:54 I don't know if the compliment itself is funny
04:02:56 but it's from a funny person
04:02:58 because they've tracked me down
04:03:00 on the PCP, on the draw cast,
04:03:02 other places in the left comments like these.
04:03:04 I love Oblivionfall.
04:03:06 I wish they were mine.
04:03:08 They will be mine.
04:03:12 Oblivion, I think that's called a stalker.
04:03:16 Look, if they're an adult female,
04:03:18 like maybe...
04:03:20 I wish they were mine.
04:03:22 Like a bro.
04:03:24 Like a conglomerate.
04:03:26 God, I can't think of anything. Sorry.
04:03:28 I only get sincere compliments
04:03:30 that are good because I'm
04:03:32 so cool.
04:03:34 I did um...
04:03:36 I don't know if it's...
04:03:38 I did win... This is bizarre.
04:03:40 I did win Best Dressed
04:03:42 in my high school yearbook
04:03:44 in my graduating class.
04:03:48 Show up in nothing but slime.
04:03:50 They could see all your junk.
04:03:52 I'm stupid. I just wore suits.
04:03:54 I just wore suits all the time.
04:03:56 Why?
04:03:58 It's like a quirky affectation
04:04:00 that I did to be funny.
04:04:02 I just wore suits to school every day.
04:04:04 That's so quirky.
04:04:06 And they won Best Dressed.
04:04:08 Yeah.
04:04:10 I wasn't actually well-dressed.
04:04:12 I just had some suits and I wore them.
04:04:14 There were other guys who actually...
04:04:16 There was one guy, I remember,
04:04:18 who was actually well-dressed.
04:04:20 He wore a sweater vest
04:04:22 and buttoned down polo shirt combinations.
04:04:24 He was actually a well-dressed guy.
04:04:26 And that guy should have won.
04:04:28 But because I was not
04:04:30 better dressed, I was more dressed.
04:04:32 It was like how in the Oscars
04:04:34 you don't really get an award for best editing.
04:04:36 You get an award for most editing.
04:04:38 Like the flashiest editing wins.
04:04:40 It's why people like the high-framing anime.
04:04:42 It's not about the animation being good.
04:04:44 It's about just having lots of it.
04:04:46 Yeah. My stupid jokes
04:04:48 wear a suit every day gimmick.
04:04:50 Attracted more attention than this guy.
04:04:52 This guy's sweater vest.
04:04:54 And so I defeated him.
04:04:56 And I taught him a valuable lesson.
04:04:58 No matter what you do in life,
04:05:00 it'll never be good enough.
04:05:02 And you'll never be rewarded for...
04:05:04 Right. You'll never get your due.
04:05:06 You have to...
04:05:08 You gotta be a piece of shit.
04:05:10 You gotta be a piece of shit if you want to win.
04:05:12 But stay hydrated.
04:05:16 Yeah. Always stay hydrated.
04:05:18 Okay. We got two more.
04:05:20 The PCP logo is actually good.
04:05:22 It's actually just an image.
04:05:26 From afar, the new PCP logo
04:05:28 actually looks pretty good.
04:05:30 Oh yeah. That fucked up one
04:05:32 last time. Well, everything looks good from afar.
04:05:36 Everything looks perfect from far away.
04:05:40 Yeah.
04:05:42 If you can't see it very well, it actually looks pretty good.
04:05:44 Uh...
04:05:46 It's true, I guess.
04:05:48 Okay. Last one.
04:05:50 My girlfriend read something.
04:05:52 Three, two, one, go.
04:05:54 PCP.
04:05:56 I just wanted to say happy 300 episode.
04:05:58 Thank you. If I made it in time
04:06:00 and if not happy 300
04:06:02 and one, that's also a cool number.
04:06:06 So I was on vacation
04:06:08 with my girlfriend last week
04:06:10 and I brought my road to Radcon
04:06:12 which finally arrived because Ben
04:06:14 learned how to write the number three.
04:06:16 We should all be really proud of him.
04:06:18 I mis-addressed this guy's own book and she said,
04:06:20 what is this? And I tried to explain
04:06:22 it's a book written by some podcast people
04:06:24 I listened to.
04:06:26 And she said, okay, I'm going to read it.
04:06:28 I don't want to know what you're into.
04:06:30 So she started reading it
04:06:32 and she said, what the fuck is this garbage?
04:06:34 They broke up.
04:06:36 Okay, but she read...
04:06:38 She started at the beginning, so she was reading
04:06:40 Trixie's chapters, so that's not on me.
04:06:42 Uh...
04:06:44 If she wanted to know what it is,
04:06:46 the book explains what it is on the back.
04:06:48 You can just read the back of the book and it says.
04:06:50 So I think she just can't read
04:06:52 because if she could she would have known.
04:06:54 There's a full explanation.
04:06:56 Right there, so.
04:07:02 RotoradCon is very funny
04:07:04 and it has called Corona in it.
04:07:06 And it explains the origin
04:07:08 of the coronavirus.
04:07:10 I've said too much. I've spoiled everything.
04:07:12 The front cover is really cool.
04:07:14 We are the reason people are dying.
04:07:16 And yes, the front cover by Michi
04:07:18 is awesome, of course.
04:07:20 She's so good.
04:07:22 Actually, I don't know if they're a girl.
04:07:24 I don't know.
04:07:26 I just... I assume Michi's a girl
04:07:28 because Michi sounds like a girl name.
04:07:30 Because I knew a girl named Michi.
04:07:32 Or who went by Michi.
04:07:34 But I actually have no idea.
04:07:36 Okay, that's the last voicemail.
04:07:38 We're done.
04:07:40 We've been going for what, is this like four hours now?
04:07:42 Yes.
04:07:44 Four in a bit.
04:07:46 Lol.
04:07:48 I'm going back to bed now.
04:07:50 I need to go eat.
04:07:52 I need to go back to bed.
04:07:54 An hour ago, I wanted nothing more than to go...
04:07:56 You know what? I'm over my hangover. I feel better.
04:07:58 I feel fine.
04:08:00 I felt so shit this whole time.
04:08:02 But now I feel okay.
04:08:04 I've been invigorating.
04:08:06 I have work in two hours.
04:08:08 I have to go to a concert in like four hours.
04:08:10 We're great.
04:08:12 It was fun being on that.
04:08:14 It was a good...
04:08:16 You know what?
04:08:18 I would wake up at 1am
04:08:20 and do this podcast again.
04:08:22 Sorry about your
04:08:24 geographical handicap.
04:08:26 Sorry that the mail doesn't go
04:08:28 to your god forsaken country.
04:08:30 I only wish I didn't have work today.
04:08:32 If I didn't have work today, this would not be a problem.
04:08:34 But I do have work today.
04:08:36 So it's mildly inconvenient.
04:08:38 Just tell your boss.
04:08:40 Just like drag yourself into work.
04:08:42 Un-shaven and un-camped.
04:08:44 And you'd be like...
04:08:46 And show them RotoradCon.
04:08:48 Wait, what the hell happened to you?
04:08:50 And you'll say I was on a
04:08:52 podcast.
04:08:54 Ben, no.
04:08:56 I'm a cleaner
04:08:58 and I'm the only employee right now.
04:09:00 I have to get the work done
04:09:02 before the building's open.
04:09:04 And I'm the only one who can do it.
04:09:06 Are you like a DeVoo window cleaner?
04:09:08 No, worse.
04:09:10 I'm a whole building cleaner.
04:09:12 Oh.
04:09:14 Oh.
04:09:16 Which includes windows.
04:09:18 Oh, so you're better than DeVoo.
04:09:22 I kept vacuum.
04:09:24 I wipe things down.
04:09:26 I have to clean the gym
04:09:28 today.
04:09:30 It's gonna be fun.
04:09:32 Okay, sweaty.
04:09:34 Leave them a note
04:09:36 on the bench press that says,
04:09:38 okay, sweaty.
04:09:42 I don't know if I can get away with
04:09:44 that passing person.
04:09:46 After you wipe their salt stains
04:09:48 off the pads
04:09:50 or whatever.
04:09:52 I feel like it uses the machines to wipe
04:09:54 any touch points down.
04:09:56 And we got any last words before we conclude today?
04:09:58 Good night.
04:10:00 I think I'm good.
04:10:02 Peace and love.
04:10:04 Peace and love.

04:10:46 Personal responsibility.
