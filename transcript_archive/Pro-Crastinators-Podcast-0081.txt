00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:19 That's right, take some PCP with us friends because this is a podcast on the internet with
00:00:24 a bunch of content creators who make cool shit and here we are talking about it.
00:00:27 I'm the best guy ever and we are joined by Tom Oliver.
00:00:32 I am a sequel to myself, I've revived my old channel, it's back, I have ten new videos
00:00:40 up in two weeks as I'm a fucking god, go subscribe to it.
00:00:45 Impressive.
00:00:46 Hippocrit is here.
00:00:48 This is part one of my sentence.
00:00:50 This is part two of my sentence.
00:00:52 The sequel.
00:00:53 What do you think?
00:00:54 A bit of use of a semicolon to break that up or otherwise that would have been two sentences.
00:00:58 I can't just say semicolon out loud, what am I gay?
00:01:01 Yeah, and we've also got Digibro and MLP once again, our favorite PCP to electric board.
00:01:12 There it is.
00:01:13 We're talking about sequels today everybody.
00:01:16 Sequels is the topic of this episode of the PCP.
00:01:19 We're really, really scraping the bottom of that barrel and God doesn't feel good.
00:01:23 That's where all the gold cake's on, so when you scrape that shit up, you know, the people
00:01:30 appreciate it.
00:01:31 Scraping the bottom of the barrel is totally thematically relevant to the topic of sequels
00:01:34 anyway because that's really what they do in sequels.
00:01:38 You gotta just like, original ideas, fuck it, we're just gonna milk this and we're gonna
00:01:42 have Halloween or 18.
00:01:45 I think we made that argument about remakes when we did our remakes episode, but I think
00:01:49 sequels are a little different depending on what kind of sequel it is because the way
00:01:55 I see it, good sequels are all about taking the original and looking at it with a critical
00:02:00 eye and saying, how do we do it even better, you know?
00:02:03 At least ideally.
00:02:04 In a perfect world, that's what all sequels would be.
00:02:07 Well, you know, I'll give it a go, I'll give it a go.
00:02:09 I was just gonna say like a perfect example of that, the perfect sequel of all time, Shrek
00:02:13 2, you know, it improved on all aspects of Shrek.
00:02:19 I actually hear that opinion most of the time about Shrek 2.
00:02:24 Shrek 2 is liked, I think.
00:02:25 And so is Shrek 3, is it?
00:02:27 Not so much.
00:02:28 In fact, 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 are like their worst than Kingdom Hearts.
00:02:34 Are there really 7?
00:02:35 There's a lot, there's at least 5.
00:02:37 There's at least 4.
00:02:38 There's at least 4.
00:02:39 There's 3 and 4, I think.
00:02:41 Okay, okay.
00:02:42 Well, I don't know.
00:02:43 This is a corporatized world we live in.
00:02:44 It's very possibly could be 7 Shrek movies, I wouldn't have to cast them.
00:02:47 Hey, well, I was just playing a sequel this very morning.
00:02:50 Actually, I'm not sure if it counts, so you guys can tell me.
00:02:52 Just like, does Mario main, like do the mainline Mario games count as sequels?
00:02:58 Like I'm playing Mario Odyssey right now.
00:02:59 And that's a sequel, right?
00:03:00 I think that counts.
00:03:01 That definitely counts.
00:03:02 I think that's an interesting question.
00:03:04 Like Mario Galaxy 2 is very definitively a sequel because it's literally like the
00:03:10 same thing but they built on it, you know, like that's exactly the kind of sequel I'm
00:03:13 talking about where they took the first game and they said, okay, this is great.
00:03:17 What can we do to tweak it to make it like a little bit fresh and new but still be the
00:03:21 same?
00:03:22 It's like a sequel is one thing and then there's like a next one in a series, which
00:03:27 is right or may not be none of it.
00:03:29 I think all the Mario games, they're sequels to each other.
00:03:35 I think the core ideas in Mario Odyssey is, you know, the platforming, the jumping and
00:03:43 all that stuff.
00:03:44 That's an idea that has been in Mario's DNA from the original Super Mario Brothers
00:03:49 and all of these are just iterations and ways of tweaking the formula.
00:03:53 Iteration is a good word, but I don't know if I'd use sequel.
00:03:55 Yeah, like look at Dr. Mario, beloved entry in the Mario franchise, totally totally different.
00:04:01 The idea of like sequel is like you would watch them or play them in a series, like
00:04:07 they are very closely linked and you would go, if you wanted to do all of them, you would
00:04:11 just, yeah.
00:04:13 Like Mario Odyssey is built so that you could play it as your first Mario game, like they
00:04:19 want you to be able to do that.
00:04:21 There's no need to play Super Mario 64 first, whereas with the Galaxy games, I think they
00:04:26 definitely intended like, hey, liked Galaxy one, now you can do another one, so that to
00:04:32 me is more sequel.
00:04:33 That almost works as an expansion of sorts.
00:04:36 It really is kind of like a level pack and then there's like additional new powers.
00:04:40 It reminds me a little bit of like Brood War from StarCraft, how like that's kind of what
00:04:45 you get.
00:04:46 You get like a bunch of new levels, bunch of new worlds, and then like Yoshi was the
00:04:49 big addition.
00:04:50 But other than that, there's not a heck of a lot.
00:04:52 Okay, here's a question I have for you guys.
00:04:54 What was Gibbs saying?
00:04:55 Yeah, go ahead.
00:04:56 I was going to say like, that's interesting, you say StarCraft because that has like DLC,
00:05:01 but it's also a sequel to StarCraft 1, and there's like, there's like, there's sequels
00:05:07 and there's like, there's expansions and sequels.
00:05:09 Sometimes there's DLC that basically are sequels.
00:05:11 True.
00:05:12 Sometimes there's DLC that continues the narrative.
00:05:14 The line is blurred.
00:05:15 Well, here's the thing, I think we're forgetting something very important, we're all trying
00:05:17 to define what a sequel is.
00:05:19 We're forgetting the fucking Urban Dictionaries.
00:05:20 Urban Dictionaries, what's going to be able to define this for us, so we don't have to
00:05:24 sit here arguing about it.
00:05:25 I've got it open.
00:05:26 I've got it open here.
00:05:27 Well, let's settle it once and for all.
00:05:28 Okay, here we go.
00:05:30 A sequel, something of inferior quality, an utterance of absolute disgust, and here's
00:05:38 the full thing.
00:05:39 A word that owes its second meaning, its second meaning, okay, to the long list of low budget
00:05:44 waste of space sequels to box office smashes in which none of the original actors appear.
00:05:49 The storyline is either non-existent or piss weak, and the only way that the 12 year old
00:05:55 mentally challenged director can salvage this train wreck is through gratuitous use of full
00:05:59 frontal nudity that would horrify even the most seasoned SBS world movies connoisseur.
00:06:05 That's a very interesting definition because what they're saying is they're defining
00:06:09 sequel as why it is a slang term to insult somebody.
00:06:15 That's why I'm never ending because the sequel's never equal as Endless Jess has said in The
00:06:19 Coolest Guy.
00:06:20 There's an idea that referring to someone as a sequel is referring to them as inferior
00:06:24 to the original.
00:06:27 But you know, the best sequels are typically better than the original, but here's a question
00:06:32 I want to ask you guys regarding the Mario thing.
00:06:34 Do you think of the Zelda games as sequels?
00:06:37 Because whereas Mario has retained most of its core elements in each of these other 3D
00:06:42 games, Zelda is pretty fucking different and there's only one Zelda game, there's only
00:06:47 a couple of them that are like considered actual sequels in the can.
00:06:51 There's Legend of Zelda, Orchardine of Time, and then there's Legend of Zelda, Orchardine
00:06:55 of Time like 2 through 7, they're all the exact same game.
00:06:59 There's different window dressing on them, but I've played a bit of Orchardine of Time,
00:07:05 I've played through all of Skyward Sword, objectively the worst Zelda game of all time.
00:07:11 It's a train wreck of Titanic proportions.
00:07:13 I've played all of them, except for Wind Waker, though I did play Phantom Hourglass.
00:07:18 I would count all those in the same camp as the Mario sequels, like they are refining
00:07:24 the formula, just because they're different sorts of games, but they're the same sort
00:07:29 of thing, where they're just progressing in some particular path.
00:07:34 If you compare Mario Sunshine to Mario Odyssey, in both games, Princess Peach is captured
00:07:41 by Bowser, Mario's gotta go savor, he does this by jumping on things occasionally using
00:07:47 the powers.
00:07:48 Princess Zelda's captured by Ganondorf, he has to cut lots of things.
00:07:50 That is not a thing that even happens in most Zelda games.
00:07:53 How often has Zelda been kidnapped by Ganondorf in the Zelda franchise?
00:07:58 It's either she's captured or turned to stone, or something that is bad by Ganon.
00:08:07 Okay, Legend of Zelda the Minish Cap, Zelda's not in it, Ganon's not in it, Zelda's in
00:08:13 it, she's at the very beginning, in fact Zelda does turn to stone, that's the whole
00:08:17 thing.
00:08:18 Yeah, yeah, Voddy does that shit.
00:08:21 My point is, Dark Souls 2, that's a sequel.
00:08:26 That is a sequel.
00:08:27 Oh god, that's an unfortunate sequel.
00:08:30 Well let me back up for a second.
00:08:34 Ocarina of Time vs Majora's Mask, which is actually a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time,
00:08:40 very thematically different, like different tone, different kind of atmosphere, and I
00:08:45 think some of the Zelda games are enough thematically that I don't know if I'd consider them a sequel,
00:08:51 although in that case it is actually a sequel and it is the most different.
00:08:55 I guess my definition of sequel has always been more, is in terms of games, has always
00:09:02 been more about the underlying mechanics and the identity of the game, because you play
00:09:08 a Mario game, it always feels like a Mario game, you never would mistake it as something
00:09:12 else, even though there's lots of other new ideas and new mechanics being layered on top
00:09:16 of it, the base idea of like, they all kind of feel very similar, you know, you play like
00:09:21 Super Mario 3D land for the DS and you play Mario Sunshine and like the core mechanics
00:09:26 of like how Mario handles, how he moves, the base moveset that he has ever since Super
00:09:30 Mario 64, that's all pretty much the same and like there's iterations and refinements
00:09:35 and tweaks, but like you go in expecting a certain feel when playing a 3D Mario game
00:09:40 and ever since Mario 64, that's really been there to some degree and so I feel like that
00:09:44 underlying pedigree is what defines a sequel and while you don't have to be like a linear
00:09:49 progression.
00:09:50 Would you put Super Mario 3D World in there then?
00:09:54 Because that game plays very differently, would you say it's also part of that same
00:09:58 sequel lineage?
00:09:59 Super Mario 3D World for the Wii U?
00:10:01 Yeah.
00:10:02 I haven't played a whole bunch of it despite the fact that it's right behind me right now,
00:10:07 but despite the fact that it's like, that's someone who's more like, it's 3D but it's
00:10:12 like an isometric kind of view, right?
00:10:13 Yeah, yeah, for the most part.
00:10:15 I think the mechanics there are still pretty much the same, like it's still a platformer,
00:10:18 like it moves very similar.
00:10:19 It's interesting to me though, Tom, that you seem to be defining sequels based on more
00:10:23 of like the mechanics as opposed to like any, I don't know, like a narrative thing or anything.
00:10:28 I mean obviously if it's something that says like Metroid Prime 2, which like I think you
00:10:32 were just playing, like yeah, okay, that's pretty clearly a sequel.
00:10:34 Nate, you just reminded me of a term that will help with this a lot.
00:10:38 My favorite term, spiritual sequel.
00:10:41 Right.
00:10:42 Because when you look at it-
00:10:43 Is that a spiritual successor or is that something different from what you're talking about?
00:10:47 Both are used, but I always think you're a spiritual sequel.
00:10:50 Like for instance, a game like Axiom Verge that is clearly meant to be a spiritual connection
00:10:58 to, well in this case I would say a sequel, but a spiritual successor to Metroid, to Super
00:11:04 Metroid, like could it be that the Mario, because when I think sequel I do think continuing
00:11:11 the actual narrative, like it's supposed to be the same, at least the same characters,
00:11:16 you know-
00:11:17 Mario has the same characters for the most part, but there's really no narrative to
00:11:20 continue.
00:11:21 Yeah, you know, and like if you look at something like Mario Galaxy, like there's no plot connection
00:11:26 like seemingly at all to like any of the other games other than Mario Galaxy 2.
00:11:29 Most of Nintendo's games don't do that.
00:11:31 Their narrative is just like a very loose framing device to have the action.
00:11:36 So I'm not sure describing the Mario games as sequels makes sense.
00:11:40 I think like spiritual successor, even though they're all like mainline Mario games, might
00:11:44 make more sense.
00:11:45 Well, as far as I know spiritual successor doesn't even, when you say something's a spiritual
00:11:47 successor, the term doesn't mean it's a sequel, it means it's taking the gameplay identity
00:11:52 of another game that won't get a sequel and injecting it into a new IP.
00:11:56 That's why Axiom Verge is a spiritual successor to Metroid.
00:11:59 It's not a Metroid title, but it's trying to play like one and invoke that kind of same
00:12:03 game feel.
00:12:04 And what were you saying?
00:12:05 I feel like the whole Mario, the whole sequel's a successor, so spiritual stuff, like it doesn't
00:12:12 need a word like that, because it doesn't apply to any of them, like aside from like
00:12:18 Mario 1, Super Mario 1, Super Mario 2, like even that's kind of weird.
00:12:22 I think the whole thing with the sequels is like people generally think of it as being
00:12:27 if it's numbered, then it's a sequel, and if it's not, then it's just part of the same
00:12:32 franchise, and this word sequel doesn't even come into it.
00:12:35 Will Radcon Awakening be a direct sequel to Radcon 2?
00:12:39 That's, I don't know, I don't know, or is it a spiritual successor?
00:12:42 That'll depend on the narrative content of Radcon Awakening.
00:12:45 Indeed.
00:12:46 Are we going to do the fuck shit thing that movie producers do and not put the number on
00:12:52 Radcon 3?
00:12:53 Is it just going to be Radcon Awakening?
00:12:55 Davoo's been making that joke forever, that he insists that the next Radcon be called
00:12:58 Radcon Awakening canonically.
00:13:00 But with no 3.
00:13:01 With no 3.
00:13:02 Oh, that burns my heart.
00:13:05 We need to do that, and then the next one just has to be Radcon.
00:13:08 Exactly.
00:13:09 Or like The Radcon.
00:13:10 The Radcon was like alternating upper and lower case for each other.
00:13:19 Oh, yes.
00:13:20 Oh no.
00:13:21 Oh, that's the one like Gamze kills us all, yeah, that's when Munchie disembowels all
00:13:26 of us.
00:13:27 We definitely release Radcon on DVD on each one.
00:13:30 We have to make sure the titles are totally different on the side.
00:13:33 Yeah.
00:13:34 Radcon 4 has to be Raphor Decon.
00:13:39 Raphor Decon.
00:13:40 I do like that, I do like that.
00:13:42 Hey, so I watched a sequel, I watched a whole series of sequels recently, which is interesting
00:13:48 because it's kind of like the opposite of all this.
00:13:50 So it's like, so I watched Rambo, I downloaded all the Rambo movies recently and watched
00:13:55 all of them.
00:13:56 Because I heard they were cool and whatever.
00:13:58 So I watched Rambo 1, and everyone probably knows this already, but Rambo 1 is like a
00:14:02 story of a tortured Vietnam vet who comes back home and then like, it suffers, like
00:14:08 he's kind of a vagrant now, he's sort of lost his place in the world because he was such
00:14:11 a badass soldier, and now he's just a civilian and doesn't know what to do with himself.
00:14:16 And like, he's just in the world and he gets into some minor trouble with the law just
00:14:20 by like loitering a little bit, wasn't serious, but then he gets like abused by the cops and
00:14:24 then they like, they fuck him up a little bit, and then like he goes on kind of a murderous
00:14:28 rampage as they like try to track him down after he escapes from the thing.
00:14:32 And then like he like kicks back into like Vietnam mode and goes full monster murder
00:14:36 man and starts doing all this shit, and so it's really a story about a guy like being
00:14:41 tortured by his past and like having to overcome it, and like at the end he turns himself in
00:14:46 and like obviously has deep severe mental issues that he's going to need to work through.
00:14:50 And then Rambo too, like they get him out of jail and then he's just sent on like a
00:14:55 big epic like rescue POWs in Vietnam, like a military man mission.
00:15:00 So it's like they've capitalized on like the reputation that Rambo established, Rambo
00:15:04 1, of this guy being like a big badass soldier, but like they completely abandoned any of
00:15:09 the like, like the actual point of the movie of it being like about.
00:15:13 It goes from like a movie trying to make a message, send a message about like mental
00:15:17 health issues and just be like, what if we have Sylvester Stallone killing some bitches?
00:15:21 That would be cool.
00:15:23 And it was great.
00:15:24 It was a legitimately great action movie that I enjoyed quite a bit, but like it's like
00:15:28 it barely resembles like, you know, in the tangible details, it totally resembles Rambo
00:15:34 1, but in terms of the actual point they were making, they completely abandoned it.
00:15:39 And it's like, I don't know like who was writing that.
00:15:41 I'm really curious if the same people were involved with making Rambo 2 as Rambo 1.
00:15:45 That feels like studio meddling to me.
00:15:48 Yeah.
00:15:49 Yeah.
00:15:50 And I know Stallone like wrote Rambo 4 and was heavily involved in getting it done, but
00:15:52 that might have just been like the resurrecting of the thing, you know, because this was like
00:15:55 two decades after Rambo 3 was made and shit.
00:15:58 But like, so that's an example.
00:15:59 That was a surprisingly good sequel though.
00:16:02 I liked it.
00:16:03 I thought it was really good.
00:16:04 I liked the part where that Christian lady got raped.
00:16:06 That was cool.
00:16:07 She didn't actually get raped, unfortunately.
00:16:10 Yeah.
00:16:11 It was, it was good.
00:16:13 It was good.
00:16:14 Here's a, here's a sequel, a pair of sequels that, that I feel just for the sake of completeness
00:16:20 needs to be mentioned is Star Wars, which has gone in a lot of interesting directions
00:16:25 with sequels.
00:16:26 Because you've got the original Star Wars, big, huge film, everybody loves it, but it's
00:16:31 kind of directed and edited like garbage.
00:16:34 Like the, it's really, they didn't like every, there was a lot of problems with the production
00:16:38 basically.
00:16:39 And when you watch the movie knowing that you can really see it and then you get to the
00:16:43 second movie and it's such a clear improvement.
00:16:47 Like they took the ideas and gave, put them in the hands of a director who could actually
00:16:51 like bring it to life, make it feel big and real and like, and dramatic.
00:16:56 And then you get to the third movie, which for some reason a lot of people don't like,
00:17:00 but I think that movie capitalizes on the themes, the best out of all the movies.
00:17:04 It like brings it all home in a really good way.
00:17:07 And so you got this package where it's like, yeah, you got sequels that actually took
00:17:11 what the previous one did, built on it, tried to improve.
00:17:15 And then, then suddenly they make three more sequels that are actually prequels and don't
00:17:23 capitalize on any of the strengths of the original and are a total clusterfuck.
00:17:27 But then you get like 23 more sequels a few, a decade later that are now just like cherry
00:17:36 picking any tangible or abstract concept from the old films and like cobbling them together
00:17:43 into a new film that is just like made up of the body parts of the old ones, you know.
00:17:49 It's a descent into corporatization, which is funny because Star Wars has always been
00:17:54 a very corporatized product, but it's gone to the nth degree now.
00:17:57 The fascinating thing about that, that trajectory is kind of like Star Wars like is pretty beloved
00:18:02 these days.
00:18:03 It's quite popular and, you know, it was popular for a long time, but like it's really had
00:18:08 a resurgence and it's interesting to watch the trajectory of everyone loved the original
00:18:12 films.
00:18:13 They're highly beloved to this day.
00:18:15 And then the sequels came out and at the time it was lukewarm and then some people were
00:18:18 massively disappointed and so the reputation tank, Luke Skywalker Warm, excellent.
00:18:25 And then, and it's funny because like, and then like now like things have kicked back
00:18:30 up as like JJ Abrams has, you know, been able to make some pretty good work, at least
00:18:33 for the first one and we'll see what the others do as well.
00:18:36 But like what's interesting is the first one was like a guy, Lucas, right?
00:18:40 Lucas is running the show, but he was tempered by the fact that he wasn't like the god of
00:18:45 the production of those.
00:18:46 His creative input was subject to the quality control of lots of other people.
00:18:51 And so it was, it was sort of a one man show, but then it was filtered through all these
00:18:55 things like sort of a committee that made it good.
00:18:59 But then you got the prequels and the prequels totally lost that filtering process and only
00:19:04 kept like what he said, like we're doing this, make it happen.
00:19:08 And nobody wanted to question him, whether it was his fault or not, doesn't matter.
00:19:11 The point is it was just what he wrote on that paper, probably too hastily without thinking
00:19:14 about it enough.
00:19:15 And that's just what became the movies.
00:19:17 And we all know what happened with that.
00:19:19 But now, and now we've got a purely corporatized product happening now, probably with people
00:19:24 who love it.
00:19:25 It's gone too far in the other direction is what you're saying.
00:19:26 Well, actually, I was going to say that like, it's funny that things have improved from
00:19:29 just like one man's mad vision by making it corporate, like they've improved, but not
00:19:34 like, I think the original was the perfect balance of those two.
00:19:38 Exactly.
00:19:39 Of course.
00:19:40 You know, he it was a lot of it was this one guy's interest and vision, but just he had
00:19:44 a good editor, you know, like a good like, and I mean, editor in the not like a literal
00:19:49 film editor, but you know what, his fellow writers and stuff, the metaphorical sense.
00:19:53 And now we've got like the editor writing the movie based on what he like what he thought
00:19:59 needed to be fixed without the actual inspiration.
00:20:02 There's no artist.
00:20:03 Yeah, exactly.
00:20:04 Exactly.
00:20:05 Exactly.
00:20:06 We got to put we got to put a certain amount of of iconography to sell toys because he
00:20:11 he right.
00:20:12 We're Disney and shit.
00:20:13 And, you know, it's it's not it's nobody's making these movies because people are longing
00:20:19 to know what happens with with the Star Wars universe.
00:20:23 I mean, I mean, kind of the people kind of did because they made books and comics.
00:20:28 Yeah, I read a lot of this.
00:20:30 It's it's just it.
00:20:31 Yeah, it's very much like you can't see as anything other than a cash cow.
00:20:36 It's hard for me to think of it as like the same series.
00:20:40 Absolutely.
00:20:40 For me, I can I can easily watch those first three films and think this is three films
00:20:46 that were that like not that they were all intended to be made from the beginning
00:20:49 because like the first movie obviously was not supposed to have sequels
00:20:53 considering it wraps everything up perfectly fine.
00:20:56 But like when you watch the other two, you go, OK, this is a natural extension
00:21:00 of that first movie, and then you watch the new ones.
00:21:02 And to me, it just feels like this is nothing to do with it.
00:21:04 And that's it's just it's a fanfiction.
00:21:07 That's the thing. See, like I really did love the original Star Wars movies
00:21:10 and probably still would if I watched it again.
00:21:12 It's just it's just kind of been a while.
00:21:13 But like the originals have such a wonderful grittiness
00:21:17 of like old filmmaking to them.
00:21:18 They remind me and not to suck their dick too hard,
00:21:20 but they remind me of like like a Casablanca or a Lawrence of Arabia
00:21:26 when like things were just they had to get down there in the fucking dirt
00:21:30 and everyone got fucking filthy and dirty and things were not polished and clean
00:21:34 and so heavily produced.
00:21:35 Things were like, I don't know, fucking ramshackle,
00:21:38 like the fucking Indiana Jones bit where the the dude has, you know,
00:21:41 got his swordplay and he's danced around and then Indiana just shoots him.
00:21:43 Like that that's that's fucking cinema gold.
00:21:47 And the story behind it as well is incredible.
00:21:49 And I for one don't like the kind of the way things have gone
00:21:53 where they've proceeded to make things so polished and clean.
00:21:56 And a lot of it, I'm sure, just has to do with the technology that's available,
00:21:59 makes it easier to do.
00:22:00 And that's kind of just a constant thing that as the as we march forward
00:22:04 in technology, that's more and more of a thing.
00:22:07 And obviously that was done to to the nth degree in the Star Wars prequels.
00:22:10 But even now, I see I see elements of that in the in the newer Star Wars stuff.
00:22:15 And they just don't feel the same as like the originals that I did love.
00:22:19 So like to call it a sequel to me is like, like this is what people complain
00:22:22 about with sequels, that they're not the thing that you love.
00:22:25 So like, stop fucking it up.
00:22:27 The thing that's interesting about what you're saying is that those those old
00:22:30 classics, they were like big budget Hollywood productions.
00:22:34 Or yeah, I think they were the best they could do at the time.
00:22:37 They were a very like, like big, heavy production produced like lots of I mean,
00:22:43 it wasn't it wasn't like a board of directors, right?
00:22:45 But it the way just films were made back then exactly made you feel like,
00:22:51 you know, you could imagine that there's a bunch of guys in the desert
00:22:55 and they're trying to get a shot and then they have their lunch break
00:22:57 and they're like, oh, it's hot out here and newer movies.
00:23:01 It's like, I don't know, it just it just feels like I just imagine the color
00:23:06 gray and then a computer screen.
00:23:07 I just I just seize up.
00:23:09 I don't like it.
00:23:10 Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
00:23:12 Something that fascinates me, there's a lot of different reasons,
00:23:15 just as there are a lot of different reasons for a movie to be made
00:23:18 or any product to be made, there's a lot of different reasons a sequel could be made.
00:23:21 And it's I think a lot of like what makes it good or bad will depend on why it's
00:23:26 happening. Totally. And like, like there's some that people make because it's like,
00:23:30 yeah, I just have more ideas.
00:23:32 I have another good idea with this world and characters.
00:23:35 So let's make a sequel and those are probably going to be the better ones.
00:23:38 And then there's the ones where it's like the show just needs to have a sequel,
00:23:42 like, like, because it has to have like, like back to the future.
00:23:45 One, two and three are examples of that.
00:23:47 Like those they had to be done because they left it deliberately open
00:23:51 and they did not give you the answers.
00:23:53 No, that's that's not what I mean.
00:23:54 No, that's more of like, like, that's more they had more ideas.
00:23:59 Like if they left it open because they knew they could make something like,
00:24:03 you know, Assassin's Creed, where it's like, it's a new year.
00:24:05 We have to make a new Assassin's Creed.
00:24:06 Oh, I sort of like that.
00:24:08 The example I'm going to use is fucking Psycho Pass,
00:24:11 because Psycho Pass 2 is horrible.
00:24:14 It is absolutely abysmal.
00:24:16 Why did and the only reason I think that Psycho Pass 2 exists
00:24:21 is because they were making a Psycho Pass movie and they wanted to keep the hype
00:24:26 up for it. Sure. So like that, like the Psycho Pass original TV show,
00:24:31 like like leading up to the film, first they reran the TV show
00:24:35 as hour long episodes, like they recut it.
00:24:38 They put each two episodes into one and they added in some like little extra scenes
00:24:43 and they made it like like a rerun of the show to get people hype.
00:24:47 Then they made a sequel to keep that hype going.
00:24:50 And then the movie came out like right after the second season was over.
00:24:53 So it was like all this build up to hype this movie.
00:24:56 And all the people who made the original show were working on the movie.
00:25:01 So in the meantime, oh, we need a sequel, but you guys are busy.
00:25:05 So let's hire on some other folks who don't understand the story at all.
00:25:10 Let's work on Dark Souls 2 while they make Bloodborne. Yeah.
00:25:12 Exactly. Exactly.
00:25:14 There has to be a sequel, but they don't have the right people to do it.
00:25:19 So it's like it's just born out of their needs to be one, you know?
00:25:23 And then that's where you're going to get the people who don't understand
00:25:27 the fundamental artistic intent like Dark Souls 2,
00:25:30 where they their mentality was Dark Souls is a hard game.
00:25:34 Let's make a hard game. Right.
00:25:35 You know, by putting a million fucking enemies behind this one door,
00:25:38 that there's no way to fucking defeat at all.
00:25:41 That's that's that's that's the difference between people
00:25:43 who see these things as as a piece of art and people who see it as a product
00:25:47 to be totally totally because the people who like the art,
00:25:50 they're going to sit down and be like, OK, I understand why this exists.
00:25:53 And I know what the vision behind it is.
00:25:55 And then you have people in like corporate who just like, well,
00:25:57 we we got to make our money for a quarter for we're going to release this land
00:26:01 and blah, blah, blah. I really think that a smart creator
00:26:06 knows that the corporate entity is a part of it.
00:26:10 And you can't just say, oh, I'm an artist and I have my vision
00:26:13 and it must just be one thing.
00:26:15 I think like if you're going to be a smart boy and you're going to, you know,
00:26:18 make things, you're going to write stories, you're going to make movies.
00:26:22 You should always have in the back of your mind written down somewhere
00:26:26 like sequel baits that if in case you're forced to make a sequel,
00:26:30 you have something, yes, but you should never like plan for it to exist.
00:26:35 You know, just like as a backup, because then then you can you can you can have both.
00:26:40 You can be an artistic genius boy and you can make money.
00:26:44 And you're very right.
00:26:45 It's really a delicate balance, especially. I recommend.
00:26:49 Sorry, I recommend everybody.
00:26:50 If you're trying to be a screenwriter, do anything that will involve you
00:26:53 in the corporate world of like creating.
00:26:58 Listen to everything Max Landis ever says,
00:27:01 because he is extremely good at explaining that world and his place in it.
00:27:04 And he has the mindset that Hippo is describing here.
00:27:07 The dude's written over a hundred movies like he just constantly has more ideas
00:27:12 for like if they won't take this one, here's a slightly different version.
00:27:16 Or like here's my ideas for if I have to make a sequel.
00:27:19 Here's my ideas for this and that.
00:27:20 It's like he's just got so many different contingencies for if it works,
00:27:25 because you can't be precious about your work if you want to sell it,
00:27:27 especially in Hollywood, you know, on this subject, though, what's interesting is
00:27:31 so one of the most beloved sequels of all time.
00:27:33 You may have heard of it is Godfather 2 and Godfather 2 was famous
00:27:37 because it was the first sequel ever to win the Oscar for Best Picture.
00:27:41 And that was quite a noteworthy event.
00:27:44 And what's especially interesting about it was that like as you'd expect.
00:27:47 So the Godfather 1 was based on a book by some Dimitri Puzo or something.
00:27:51 Yes, some guy who had written a book and then they adapted it.
00:27:54 And obviously that's where kind of Mario Puzo, that's it.
00:27:56 And Francis Ford Coppola directed it.
00:27:58 And that was a beloved project.
00:28:01 Actually, Coppola was actually put on it by a studio.
00:28:03 He didn't even want to do it at first.
00:28:04 And there was a lot of whatever bullshitting going on.
00:28:07 But it eventually turned out to be a great product.
00:28:09 And so once Godfather 1 was such a success, like it was a studio request
00:28:14 that they go on and make Godfather 2.
00:28:16 And like so he was not at all prepared to do Godfather 2.
00:28:21 And there was like no, there was nothing prepared for it.
00:28:24 But like it's just that the people working on the project
00:28:28 just happened to be so fucking good at making movies.
00:28:31 And I actually think Godfather 1 is like kind of vastly superior to Godfather 2.
00:28:34 But a lot of people love Godfather 2 and I do it for the most part as well.
00:28:38 I'm a big aficionado with the Godfather movies in case you can't tell.
00:28:41 But so ultimately like this is a situation where people were totally
00:28:45 unprepared. It was just studio desire to make a sequel that had them do it.
00:28:50 Because Coppola had no desire to do one initially.
00:28:52 It was just because the movie was such a fucking huge success that they made it.
00:28:56 And yet they just happened to get like enough brilliant people working on it.
00:28:59 Coppola and I believe Puzo came back and wrote the screenplay for it as well.
00:29:03 That they just put together something that the people fucking loved.
00:29:05 And so like so it can be done. It can be done.
00:29:08 You know, kind of that's the same story of how the Madoka movies got made.
00:29:13 Oh yeah. Where like Madoka Magica was just such a huge success that they came
00:29:16 with the Rybujigan and were like, do you happen to have any ideas for a sequel?
00:29:20 And he was like, I guess.
00:29:23 He made a movie that was the devil, you guys.
00:29:26 He made possibly the most divisive anime movie that I can think of.
00:29:32 Personally, I'm in the I fucking hate it camp.
00:29:34 But there's definitely a camp that absolutely adores that movie.
00:29:36 I enjoyed it. Dude, that opening scene of them eating the cake monster.
00:29:40 Well, sure. Just fan service is great.
00:29:42 Yeah, God, it was so fucking tight.
00:29:44 I like that movie. I don't give a fuck.
00:29:46 Here's an idea. I want us to do some I want us to do a round robin here.
00:29:50 Word. And each of us talk about one sequel we absolutely hate or are
00:29:54 fascinated with in that it is bad and one that we absolutely love.
00:30:00 Great. Fantastic. Fascinated with this.
00:30:01 All right. So we'll start with bad ones.
00:30:05 I've got to talk about because I've been this is something I experienced recently.
00:30:08 The lost planet games.
00:30:10 Have any of you played lost planet?
00:30:12 I know played a little bit of it, but are they all like dino crisis?
00:30:18 No. OK, never mind.
00:30:20 But they're there.
00:30:21 It's a series of Capcom games that was for the Xbox 360.
00:30:25 The first game was like a launch title for the 360.
00:30:28 And the first game is basically like an arcade over the person shooter game.
00:30:33 Like basically you're on this planet of ice and you run around
00:30:37 and you shoot like giant bug monsters.
00:30:39 And there's lots of mechs you can pilot and you fight lots of like
00:30:43 basically just you you pilot mechs and you fight other mechs and monsters.
00:30:47 And it's really cool. It's like five hours long.
00:30:49 It's a fun game.
00:30:50 But there's a lot of ways that it obviously could have been improved with the sequel.
00:30:54 Like it's it's pretty small.
00:30:56 It was obviously like testing the hardware because it was like one of the first games
00:31:00 for the console. So like the biggest strengths that the game has are that
00:31:04 everything's really big.
00:31:06 Everything's very vertical.
00:31:07 You can like climb any surface with the grappling hook and stuff,
00:31:10 but not actually any surface.
00:31:11 So that would have been an improvement.
00:31:13 Make it so you can climb any surface.
00:31:15 Even bigger levels, even bigger monsters, more variety and choice,
00:31:18 because it's very linear.
00:31:19 There's a lot of obvious ways the game could be improved.
00:31:22 So they make a sequel and in the sequel,
00:31:25 because co-op games were all the rage at the time,
00:31:28 they just completely retool the game to be a co-op game.
00:31:33 And even though they retain all of like the weapons and controls and monsters
00:31:37 from the previous game, the level design is nothing like the first games level design.
00:31:43 And it's not really built in a way that works with the mechanics.
00:31:47 Like it's built to be they just took the mechanics of Lost Planet
00:31:50 and put them in a co-op shooter game, but they don't make sense in a co-op shooter game.
00:31:54 So it's incredibly fucking frustrating and broken.
00:31:57 Like it's a game that has some good ideas and moments where it kind of works.
00:32:01 But like it's just not it shouldn't have been done.
00:32:04 Like it was not the right IP to transform into a co-op game.
00:32:08 And so it got pretty lukewarm reviews and it didn't sell as well as the first game.
00:32:13 So then they make Lost Planet three.
00:32:15 And instead of making a game, Capcom just outsources it to some other studio.
00:32:22 This studio, here's here is everything I know about this studio.
00:32:26 They've made six games.
00:32:27 And if you go to the Wikipedia page, all it says about them is
00:32:30 they are known for having a 56 average on Metacritic.
00:32:34 And what company is this?
00:32:36 I don't remember what it's called, but like all they've made is shitty games.
00:32:39 Like all of their games, every single one of them has like a below 60 on Metacritic.
00:32:44 And that is the most noteworthy thing about the company.
00:32:47 So they make a third game that plays like it plays kind of like Mass Effect 3
00:32:53 if no one with any talent worked on the game.
00:32:56 Like if it if it was just a boring piece of shit.
00:32:59 This is Spark Unlimited Spark Unlimited, apparently.
00:33:02 Yes, Spark Unlimited.
00:33:04 This game is fun.
00:33:05 I played like the first 15 minutes of the game.
00:33:08 I was like, this is the worst game I've ever played in my life.
00:33:11 So, yeah, at that point, the idea of what Lost Planet is is just completely gone.
00:33:16 It's gone. Right.
00:33:17 You know, and like, and so you've got this first game that I would consider
00:33:21 like a strong seven to a light eight.
00:33:23 Like it's a very fine game.
00:33:24 It's not amazing.
00:33:26 And you can so easily imagine a perfect sequel, but it's not there.
00:33:31 Instead, the franchise is dead now.
00:33:33 I've lost the bureaucracy.
00:33:35 Yeah. Yep.
00:33:36 What a tragedy.
00:33:37 You know, I almost I almost feel bad for like game developers
00:33:41 who are put in a project that like corporate influence doesn't allow them
00:33:44 to like actually make the game to like be consistent with the fucking mechanics and shit.
00:33:48 Like, can you even imagine developing a game where like you're not thinking
00:33:51 about how to integrate the level design with the mechanics?
00:33:54 I can't even think about it.
00:33:56 But OK, no matter.
00:33:58 I mean, I feel like that mindset is sort of like a paint by numbers
00:34:02 because you're given the iconography, the characters, the types of things
00:34:06 that need to be in there because of like, let's borrow, you know, we have to have
00:34:10 this thing and that thing from that game or movie and put it in there
00:34:14 to link them because they're sequels and we'll do it kind of like they're not
00:34:18 thinking about building a game.
00:34:20 They're thinking about
00:34:23 cash it in. They're thinking about cash in an IP.
00:34:26 Yes, that, too. That, too.
00:34:28 I was like, I can't really think of like a lot of sequels that have disappointed
00:34:33 me, although, I don't know.
00:34:35 But what about Jack two?
00:34:39 I love Jack two.
00:34:39 But I was a kid at the time.
00:34:42 Jack X. Well, that's that's the thing I was going to think of.
00:34:46 There's going to talk about because like that feels like a spin off
00:34:49 because it's a different gameplay style in the same universe.
00:34:52 And I was thinking Mario 64.
00:34:56 I wouldn't consider a sequel to Mario, Super Mario World because of how
00:35:00 different it is.
00:35:01 And I would also consider that like a spin off technically, like like the 3D
00:35:06 Mario's were a spin off of the 2D Mario's because you can't really compare
00:35:10 one, you know, sequel sequentially to the next.
00:35:14 So let me ask you the way I think of sequels.
00:35:17 Would it would it change your opinion if instead Mario World was called Mario
00:35:21 four and then Mario 64 was called Mario five?
00:35:24 Would that change your view of it being a sequel?
00:35:27 Um, I think, I mean, the numbers thing is always like like hardwired to
00:35:34 think sequel, right?
00:35:36 Because that's just a word associated with numbered stuff.
00:35:39 So I guess I might.
00:35:40 But I if I thought about it, I probably would come to the same conclusion
00:35:44 because it's like, OK, it's about branding.
00:35:48 Branding is relevant as to whether
00:35:50 something is considered a sequel or not.
00:35:52 Franchises are terrible.
00:35:54 I hate franchises.
00:35:55 I hate the fact that things in a franchise can can can exist.
00:36:00 I know there's a sequel that you despite Ratchet Future Tools of Destruction.
00:36:05 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:36:06 Was wrong with that one.
00:36:07 PlayStation 3, there's a number of French stuff.
00:36:12 One of the Ratchet games from PS3 sucked.
00:36:15 I played all of them like last year.
00:36:17 One of them was really good.
00:36:18 One of them sucked balls.
00:36:20 I don't remember if it was future.
00:36:21 It was the first one that this was the first one.
00:36:25 It was future.
00:36:26 But there was one Ratchet and Clank game for the PS3 that came out
00:36:29 like later in the PS3 that had it was like a weird co-op game
00:36:33 that didn't play like Ratchet and Clank or something.
00:36:35 That that is definitely a spin off.
00:36:38 I don't know how much leniency I want to give to things that I would consider
00:36:41 a spin off. I still just think spin offs are gross.
00:36:44 Yeah, I think of I think of Ratchet deadlocked as a spin off.
00:36:47 And that's actually a good game.
00:36:48 Yeah, I've heard people like that one.
00:36:50 Yeah.
00:36:50 Yeah.
00:36:51 But anyway, fucking Ratchet and also Sly Cooper,
00:36:55 like they had great games on the PS2.
00:36:57 One, two, three, one, two, three, three games on the PlayStation 2.
00:37:00 Ratchet and Clank went to PlayStation 3
00:37:04 and it had another trilogy of games.
00:37:07 But because they knew they could make a trilogy of games,
00:37:10 the game, the first game ends on a cliffhanger,
00:37:13 which always pissed me off because it's not a complete story.
00:37:17 And you have to like that.
00:37:18 They're just like, yeah, we know you're going to buy all three of them.
00:37:21 So just fucking don't get the whole experience.
00:37:24 Yeah.
00:37:26 Agreed.
00:37:27 Also, it was just kind of shit in general.
00:37:29 I was under the impression it was like almost like a vignette game.
00:37:32 Like they it was only like 10 hours long, right?
00:37:34 Whereas like the previous Ratchet games had all been like 25 hours to get a hundred percent.
00:37:38 Yeah, it was it was it was really short.
00:37:40 The story was more stupid and the 3D
00:37:44 the like PlayStation 3 shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny textures
00:37:47 really annoyed me and and, you know, lens flares and stuff.
00:37:51 But the Sly games, Sly Raccoon, Sly Cooper, the gang, the gang.
00:37:56 They they look really good in the PlayStation 2
00:37:59 and in the PlayStation 3 games, they also look good.
00:38:01 Like the visuals weren't fucked and the animations were good.
00:38:05 It was just something it's definitely because it was a different studio.
00:38:09 But it doesn't it doesn't feel good.
00:38:12 It doesn't have the same like like a wit and and and like
00:38:17 story structure. It's just sort of like, oh,
00:38:20 when you're someone who doesn't know what's what's what's up when you don't have
00:38:24 the people there like when you don't have the people there
00:38:26 who like made the thing and really understand it.
00:38:28 Like you see this with like Tom Hewlett and the later like Silent Hill games.
00:38:32 Like the soul is just missing.
00:38:34 The even if even if it was never clear to anyone what actually made the games great,
00:38:38 something's you're never going to get everything,
00:38:40 especially the person like Tom Hewlett is like a self-avowed Silent Hill fanboy.
00:38:44 Like a fanboy is never going to fucking be able to like recreate it.
00:38:48 Yeah, it's always it's always with the creative minds like, like, you know,
00:38:53 George Lucas, he needs to be there a little bit.
00:38:56 And it's a fool's errand to even try to recreate it.
00:38:59 Just make something new. OK, but whatever.
00:39:01 Well, that's that's the funny thing.
00:39:02 Something I've grown to appreciate more and more.
00:39:05 The more I look at art and the more I know like the backgrounds of it is like
00:39:09 there really is a lot of art that could only have come from that one guy.
00:39:13 Damn right. Like no one else on planet fucking Earth could do it.
00:39:18 Or that one team because of just like the chemistry between them.
00:39:21 Maybe, you know, like maybe it was just at the boardroom meetings they had.
00:39:25 We're so magnetic that it spawned this this thing and like you can't recreate that.
00:39:30 You know, sometimes even they can't recreate that.
00:39:33 But imagine imagine if all of the PCP members
00:39:36 had like moved on and given their channels to people who, you know,
00:39:40 tried to be like each of all of us.
00:39:42 And then the PCP podcast was like it would be technically everyone kind of.
00:39:48 But it would be not even, you know, not even slightly the same.
00:39:52 That's an excellent. It might even be better, but like it's just.
00:39:57 You need you need the the brain power of the weird guy.
00:40:01 It's true. Yeah, it's true.
00:40:04 Um, Tom or Nate, you have a sequel that I've got something just to bounce off
00:40:08 of that of the last point you were just begging, I'll go into this.
00:40:11 And it's like, I'll give you a like time and place is so important for this.
00:40:16 So like a game that I kind of like Final Fantasy seven,
00:40:19 like a big theme in that whole game is like death and life after death.
00:40:23 And all of that was caused by Sakaguchi's fucking mom dying during development of the game.
00:40:28 And so they wrote it in this.
00:40:30 They made it part of the fucking story.
00:40:32 And like it's a huge thematic thing throughout the whole thing.
00:40:34 And only because of the particular circumstances there did that even happen.
00:40:38 So like trying to recreate that is whatever pointless.
00:40:40 But that that's what brings me to a little sequel you might have heard of
00:40:44 called Final Fantasy seven, Advent Children, direct sequel to Final Fantasy seven.
00:40:49 Yeah, of course.
00:40:51 And in a larger context, it's the entire compilation of Final Fantasy seven
00:40:56 that sort of counts like sequels, prequels, side stories, whatever.
00:41:00 The whole thing is incredibly offensive to me in every possible way.
00:41:04 It's them saying that, and of course, this extends to the remake as well.
00:41:08 I hear all these fucking people chatter in a way every fucking day about how
00:41:12 oh, they're going to have time to expand on the things they didn't get to.
00:41:15 And the original five is seven.
00:41:17 Don't you want to explore a final?
00:41:18 Don't you want to explore Midgard?
00:41:20 Don't you want to, I don't know, remember other things they wanted to put in
00:41:23 unless they wrote them down exactly, exactly.
00:41:26 Only you can maybe make a case that putting back cut content in
00:41:30 maybe could fit in there.
00:41:31 But even then, I wouldn't even want that necessarily.
00:41:35 Maybe I'd look at a case by case basis.
00:41:37 But like it's been like 25 fucking years or whatever, 30 years or something.
00:41:41 Like everyone's changed massively from the person they were
00:41:44 when the game was originally made, like they have no business meddling with this
00:41:48 shit. Somebody who fucking tells me Nomura is like qualified to remake
00:41:51 Final Fantasy seven get fucked.
00:41:53 Yes, I know he was heavily involved in the development of the characters
00:41:56 and even the shaping of much of the fundamentals of the personalities
00:41:59 of those characters.
00:42:00 He has no fucking business directing a goddamn remake of the game
00:42:04 because he's not fucking smart enough.
00:42:06 He's a corporate tool and a drawboy and he has no he's no fucking purpose
00:42:11 here, whatever, fuck these people.
00:42:12 If if if if a ukulele has taught me anything is it's the yes,
00:42:18 the getting the same guys to do the same thing still can have
00:42:22 different results if the people change because they can't help but change
00:42:26 because time we didn't even talk about that's the same environment.
00:42:29 Right. That's such a great point.
00:42:31 Like the ukulele is such a great little it's anecdotal, but it's a great
00:42:35 example of exactly what you just said.
00:42:36 They they literally got back the team back together.
00:42:39 But it had been like you said, 20 fucking years since they'd made
00:42:42 Banjo-Kazooie or whatever.
00:42:43 And apparently they didn't have a minute.
00:42:46 Didn't have it in them and I'm sure it wasn't literally everyone
00:42:50 who worked on Banjo-Kazooie.
00:42:52 And I'm sure I didn't have the budget of Banjo-Kazooie.
00:42:54 And I'm sure like, you know, it didn't have the corporate structure of
00:42:58 Rareware, a bunch of guys fucking around, you know, where who's their boss?
00:43:03 Who do they have to answer to at the end of the day?
00:43:05 Yeah, it's it's like if you want to make a fucking Kickstarter
00:43:07 repackers, nobody.
00:43:10 If you tell me about like like close as possible sequel, you need both
00:43:15 the artist and the like the corporate situation that they were in when
00:43:19 they made the thing in the first place.
00:43:20 Yeah. Yeah.
00:43:21 So they need the same sort of incentives.
00:43:23 Another thing I think is you have to like keep striking while the iron's hot.
00:43:27 Like when you when you have like 20 years removed from the original thing,
00:43:31 like these people grow, they change, they have different motivations and stuff.
00:43:35 There's no way I could create any of the shit on my YouTube channel.
00:43:39 There's no way I could make the same thing 20 years from now.
00:43:42 Of course, like there is no fucking way.
00:43:45 And like, even if that stuff ends up having like a huge impact on some people
00:43:49 and they still remember like the asterisk where sucks 20 years from now,
00:43:52 like, which there's no way.
00:43:54 But like if if that happens, there's no way I could just make another like,
00:43:58 oh, I'm going to finally do season two after 20 years.
00:44:00 Like, no, like fucking great example of this is for all of us.
00:44:05 None of us could make my little pony videos with the kind of enthusiasm we do.
00:44:08 Yeah, great. That's a great example.
00:44:10 Yeah, I would be fucking impossible because it's just I'm like it's not
00:44:16 that I've lost the abilities I had, but the the mindset isn't there.
00:44:21 And it's just like like just like the most important part.
00:44:23 Just that it's this is so fucking basic and so many people don't fucking get it.
00:44:27 So let me beat into your goddamn skulls.
00:44:28 Like just think about it, people.
00:44:29 Like fucking Nomura was the one who I believe as I was reading.
00:44:33 Still talking about.
00:44:34 I was just a great example.
00:44:35 Nomura was the guy who suggested that Aris die.
00:44:38 I believe it was him because I like there was discussion about like they were going
00:44:41 to have a character die, maybe be Tifa, maybe somebody else.
00:44:43 And I believe Aris was like his suggestion is like,
00:44:46 she should die, whatever.
00:44:47 And like like it's been 25 fucking years or whatever.
00:44:51 Like the man's a father now.
00:44:52 He's like a huge corporate like he's so ingrained in the corporatocracy of
00:44:57 Square Enix, this giant behemoth of a company, which does so much now,
00:45:01 so much more now than the small potatoes of making a fucking shitty JRPG series
00:45:05 that's nobody gives a shit about anymore.
00:45:07 You know, like he is a different fucking man.
00:45:09 He's not a maverick artist anymore.
00:45:11 Like like you could argue that he was.
00:45:13 I don't even know if he fucking was.
00:45:14 But like people fucking change and I'm so fucking sick of people saying that
00:45:18 like just because they've got Kitase, Nomura back to work on this or Grant
00:45:22 Kirk and Hope or whoever to work on fucking ukulele, it's going to be the same
00:45:25 shit. It's so fucking obviously not true.
00:45:28 It pisses me the fuck off.
00:45:29 The people don't get it.
00:45:30 Anyway, fuck the compilation of five has seven.
00:45:32 I will kill myself on the day that the remake comes out.
00:45:35 It's going to be great.
00:45:35 Looking forward to it.
00:45:37 OK, let's go.
00:45:38 You're going to go for fucking Mishima.
00:45:41 Yeah, you know, you're going to go into the skier.
00:45:43 You're going to fly like a helicopter into the Square Enix offices.
00:45:47 You fell yourself on the desk of Nomura.
00:45:49 Like it's going to be good to no avail.
00:45:52 Just as a symbol.
00:45:53 Yeah.
00:45:54 You know what the best set of sequels are for the like for what we were just
00:45:58 talking about is fucking Five Nights at Freddy's.
00:46:01 All of those ones that those are well received despite.
00:46:04 Yeah, despite what like what people like generally think of them as like a stupid
00:46:09 fucking piece of garbage series, they are actually like for the
00:46:13 people who like that sort of thing, they are great sequels and they continually
00:46:17 like because of because of how fast they're being like four months.
00:46:20 You got a new one or something.
00:46:21 It's ridiculous or something like that.
00:46:23 And it's like that they all build on the whole thing and it's like fucking
00:46:27 there's a movie at some point, I think.
00:46:29 Yeah, like this guy is no he knows what he's doing.
00:46:33 Hey, I respect.
00:46:36 Tom, you got a sequel that disappointed you.
00:46:39 Oh God, absolutely.
00:46:41 Is it Metroid 2 Metroid Prime 2 that you were tweeting about dropping earlier
00:46:44 tonight?
00:46:44 I don't I'm not a huge fan of some of the stuff Metroid Prime is doing.
00:46:48 But overall, I give it I give it a solid eight for sure.
00:46:50 Oh, OK, it's not it's not a piece of shit.
00:46:52 Um, God, what was this like 2002, 2003?
00:46:57 And I think I might have told the story before on the show.
00:47:00 But I was a young lad who had just gotten his PlayStation 2 like a year ago.
00:47:07 And I was so excited for this game to come out.
00:47:10 And I was an avid reader of EGM.
00:47:12 And so every month I would double make right to double make right to oh my God.
00:47:18 I've played I've played so much of the original.
00:47:20 It's like my favorite PS2 game.
00:47:22 Fucking I have not heard you tell that story.
00:47:24 I just figured it out.
00:47:25 The details.
00:47:27 Well, here's let me let me tell you about this day.
00:47:29 Yeah, I counted down the days.
00:47:30 I watched the trailer over and over again because the trailer was fucking sick.
00:47:35 And I love the way the art style.
00:47:37 It was so good.
00:47:37 And you could shoot guns in two directions.
00:47:39 That's so fucking cool.
00:47:40 Pretty cool.
00:47:41 It was the fucking hype is shit.
00:47:43 And and I like I don't have like money to buy games.
00:47:47 So I buy like one or two games a year.
00:47:49 And so like I made all my purchasing decisions from Electronic Gaming Monthly.
00:47:53 I subscribe that I love that magazine.
00:47:55 And so I would always read every single one of them cover to cover.
00:47:59 Like the little comics with the two agents.
00:48:02 That was that magazine.
00:48:03 Sue and Chen.
00:48:03 He still makes those comics.
00:48:05 He has a YouTube channel.
00:48:05 He does animations.
00:48:06 They're fantastic.
00:48:07 Oh, I follow him.
00:48:07 He's great.
00:48:08 Um, so I get I get the month's issue where and where they are going to review
00:48:14 Devil May Cry 2 and I flip it open.
00:48:16 And I and like before you read all the reviews, there's a page where they tell
00:48:19 you what the game of the month is and it's not Devil May Cry 2.
00:48:22 Oh, no.
00:48:23 And it was at that moment I knew something bad had happened.
00:48:28 Yeah, because they would have because because a game of that scale, it could
00:48:32 have been like a seven out of ten and they would have made it game with it.
00:48:36 Like, like, like it could have been legitimately a seven out of ten, but
00:48:40 they would have given it a 10 because it was that big.
00:48:42 Exactly.
00:48:43 It has to be like a real because they had they had run multiple stories on
00:48:47 the game leading up to its release.
00:48:48 That's how I like my gun so hard over this fucking misogynist gamer culture
00:48:52 can't handle a strong female character like Lucia.
00:48:55 They fucking hit her just because she's got a vagina.
00:48:57 It's time to accept the girls can be powerful too.
00:48:59 You piece of shit.
00:49:00 Oh my God.
00:49:01 But yeah, I flipped to it and it's like 6.5, 5.5.
00:49:05 Because they did they had three people review the games back then.
00:49:09 And it was like a two parade spread of just like this game blows nuts.
00:49:12 And we're just like, oh, no, I hate.
00:49:15 I just I've literally I've never been the same person since that was that was
00:49:19 actually my first devil may cry game.
00:49:23 I fucking dude, it was the worst.
00:49:24 And then I remember my friend bought it like at some point later.
00:49:27 And so I played at his house and I was just like in awe of how bad they
00:49:32 fucked everything up.
00:49:33 That was like there were some cool ideas in there, too, which
00:49:36 which made it sting even worse because they had a dedicated dodge button
00:49:40 because like dodging was kind of like a cluster fucking the original.
00:49:43 Because you had to like hold down both shoulder buttons and shit.
00:49:45 And it was weird, but they had like just a dodge button.
00:49:47 And it made like everything so much cooler.
00:49:48 But like, yeah, the guns were shit.
00:49:51 Like there was the game feel was terrible.
00:49:53 Like the hits were awful.
00:49:55 They changed the way the combo system worked and it was really bad.
00:49:58 And oh, it was it was did you have to go back and beat those games
00:50:01 as a devil may cry fan?
00:50:03 Just out of I have beat I've beaten them all but two because I just can't get
00:50:06 through it. It's just so painfully bad.
00:50:08 Why was to so bad?
00:50:10 Like what happened in production?
00:50:12 Did some of it was not come a Mia or whatever.
00:50:15 He didn't direct.
00:50:15 I know he had nothing to do with it.
00:50:17 They passed it off to a new studio and they clearly had no idea what they
00:50:20 were doing. So did he come back for three?
00:50:23 Yes, I believe he came back for three because three was fucking amazing.
00:50:27 And like, yeah, it's like Dark Souls.
00:50:29 It's true. It's true.
00:50:31 You can tell that they knew that the last one was so bad.
00:50:34 They like, wait, kicked everything up to 11.
00:50:35 And if it is, if it is literally Dark Souls,
00:50:38 what was Kamiya doing during Devil May Cry 2's development?
00:50:42 Oh, that's check. That is a damn good question.
00:50:45 Did he work on he was beautiful seven or that have been later?
00:50:50 I don't I'm going to check.
00:50:51 I'm going to look at his beautiful Joe is too long later.
00:50:54 Resident Evil Zero.
00:50:56 Now, Devil May Cry, Resident Evil Zero, beautiful Joe Phoenix,
00:50:58 right? An ace attorney trials and tribulations.
00:51:00 What the fuck? Oh, voice actor for Godot in the Japanese version.
00:51:03 Never mind.
00:51:05 Yeah, either Resident Evil Zero or beautiful Joey is working out at the time.
00:51:08 It's probably Resident Evil.
00:51:09 Both much better games than Devil May Cry 2.
00:51:11 So time will spend. I'll give him that.
00:51:13 Yeah. But yeah, oh, my God, it's just
00:51:17 it's the level of disappointment.
00:51:19 Just it can't be described in words.
00:51:21 It was that was when my child.
00:51:22 He didn't work on Devil May Cry 3, though.
00:51:24 That's not. No, he did not. No, he did not.
00:51:26 Somebody else really.
00:51:27 So yeah, somebody else who is also a jury.
00:51:30 I don't know. I don't know.
00:51:31 It's deadly. The spiritual
00:51:33 the spiritual sequel to that man worked on Devil May Cry 3.
00:51:35 The same guy who did three do four then
00:51:37 because like it's interesting you say that that man, my favorite
00:51:40 character of all time, I don't know what his name is.
00:51:42 I don't know that.
00:51:43 That's the main villain of Guilty Gear X.
00:51:46 That man character that man.
00:51:49 Gabe, you are aware that that's a character or were you just
00:51:52 were you memeing? No, no, he was not at all.
00:51:56 There's a guy. Now you know, there's the main villain in Guilty Gear
00:52:00 is literally named that man.
00:52:02 God, I fucking love it.
00:52:03 That's not my favorite thing about Guilty Gear by far.
00:52:05 Rad Khan Awakening.
00:52:06 I'm doing a lecture on the lore of Guilty Gear.
00:52:08 Get ready. I can't wait.
00:52:09 I can't wait.
00:52:10 It looks it looks like DMC three was done by a guy.
00:52:15 It was actually done by the same guy who did DMC two.
00:52:17 What? Yeah, this guy.
00:52:20 I guess you've got a shit together.
00:52:22 Hideaki Itsuno and he directed
00:52:25 Yeah, we cry two through four and Dragon's Dog.
00:52:27 Wow. OK, I guess they just like, I don't know,
00:52:30 figured their shit out or something.
00:52:31 Wow, that that confuses the hell you know what?
00:52:33 You know what? I kind of respect that.
00:52:35 I kind of respect that this guy like, you know,
00:52:37 he pulled himself up from the from the from the abyss.
00:52:40 From the apparently he was only brought on
00:52:41 to Devil May Cry two midway through development
00:52:45 to replace an unidentified director
00:52:50 dissatisfied by how their work on the game was coming together.
00:52:53 Basically, he had to salvage the project from somebody.
00:52:56 He's the guy who brought the dodge button.
00:52:57 I got you. Yeah, I'm sure that's right.
00:53:00 Absolutely.
00:53:00 Fast. We went we he probably went.
00:53:02 OK, this game is completely unplayable.
00:53:05 But at least if we put in a dodge button,
00:53:07 beatable contribution, it was just really fantastic.
00:53:13 Atrocious. But yeah, that was my biggest sequel let down.
00:53:16 You know, it's funny.
00:53:17 The first Devil May Cry I played was Devil May Cry two.
00:53:19 And I remember thinking what the fuck is going on?
00:53:21 I'm not going to play this game anymore.
00:53:23 Yeah, you made the right call.
00:53:26 Good series. God damn it. Fuck.
00:53:29 Devil May Cry five.
00:53:29 When total gaming Brit, I was going to call him total biscuit.
00:53:33 I'm at the gaming Brit.
00:53:35 I've given up hope every E3.
00:53:37 I'm just like, is this going to be the year and it's never the year.
00:53:40 This is now the Devil May Cry cast.
00:53:41 We've really what's what's each of your favorite sequel
00:53:46 or one that's interesting in some way.
00:53:48 I got one. Sure.
00:53:49 All right, go for it.
00:53:50 So my there's a ton of great fucking fantastic sequels.
00:53:53 Halo two was amazing.
00:53:56 But but the one that I think really fucking blew my mind
00:53:58 in terms of just like taking a good idea and making it so much better
00:54:02 was Zone of the Enders, the second runner. Oh, yeah.
00:54:05 Oh, yeah. That's absolutely true.
00:54:07 The game is the kid.
00:54:09 Can we just appreciate how fucking good that intro for that game is?
00:54:14 Is that like they build up this whole thing of just like, oh,
00:54:18 the Jehuti is so much more like aerobatic
00:54:22 and it can move around, you can shoot multiple guys.
00:54:23 And it's not just one on one combat anymore, but they give you like 10 minutes.
00:54:28 I can't aerodynamic and acrobatic.
00:54:31 I think it's both you correcting Tom's pronunciation.
00:54:37 So so. But the great thing of that game is at the beginning,
00:54:40 they just trap you in the shitty mining mech.
00:54:42 And you have to walk down a straight path for 10 minutes.
00:54:45 It is like, oh, my God, please end me.
00:54:48 And then you get into Jehuti and it's so much fucking better.
00:54:50 And you're like, oh, my God.
00:54:52 And then you lock on like 50 dudes at once.
00:54:54 And it's the greatest.
00:54:55 And then at the end of the game, you get the fucking Nitro Cannon or whatever
00:54:58 the fuck it's called. Oh, my God.
00:55:00 It was the fucking best.
00:55:01 That whole that whole Anubis fight was so fucking awesome.
00:55:05 Yeah, I gave fucking rules.
00:55:06 Kojima Productions, Zone of the Enders 3.
00:55:08 When I'm ready for it, baby, laying on me.
00:55:12 Wasn't there a lost in concept about that or something?
00:55:14 There was a hyper bit hero.
00:55:15 Yeah, it was like a thing that was supposed to happen.
00:55:18 I got to check that out again.
00:55:19 I forget the details.
00:55:20 Everything good. I don't get.
00:55:21 I just made a vlog yesterday about how all my favorite gaming series are dead.
00:55:26 I have no leg in the race, including just like your precious Dreamcasts
00:55:30 and your Sega consoles.
00:55:31 Yeah, that's everything I like dies.
00:55:33 So I'm expecting all of you to die soon.
00:55:37 What is a good ongoing game?
00:55:39 I guess you don't like Zelda or Mario, right?
00:55:42 Like, I think the only the only thing is Metroid.
00:55:44 Metroid's the only game that I still like.
00:55:46 And that like, I mean, I just got revived like two days ago.
00:55:50 Exactly.
00:55:51 So now that I'm into it, I'm sure Prime for a bomb.
00:55:55 It'll be terrible.
00:55:56 It's not going to be done by retro studios, by some fucking
00:55:58 what's the guys who did lots of planet?
00:56:00 They're going to be doing.
00:56:03 Spark unlimited or something.
00:56:05 Yeah, it's going to be a shit show.
00:56:07 All right, let me let me give you my favorite sequel of all time.
00:56:10 I've talked about it a lot.
00:56:11 But but once upon a time, there was a piece of shit called Gun Buster.
00:56:15 And then they did everything right for once and made
00:56:18 Die Buster like 15 years later or whatever.
00:56:21 Now, Gun Buster is fantastic.
00:56:22 And the fact that I like Die Buster even more or rather aim for the top one
00:56:26 Gun Buster and aim for the top two Die Buster is just a testament
00:56:30 to how fucking great Die Buster is.
00:56:32 So Gun Buster, everybody.
00:56:34 It's the old-ass Amino directed 80s anime about Amino.
00:56:38 What do I say?
00:56:38 Amino directed.
00:56:39 I say Ahiru fucking.
00:56:43 What's the man's name?
00:56:45 I know, right?
00:56:46 Whatever. That guy, he directed a piece of shit anime.
00:56:49 It was really good.
00:56:50 I loved it about about being in space, a bunch of sexy girls having
00:56:56 hard work and guts, and then they travel close to the speed of light.
00:56:59 So relatively gets all fucked and everybody ages.
00:57:01 And it's the best thing ever.
00:57:02 But then then his his little deputy animator guy, what's his name?
00:57:07 Digi director Kasia Sudamaki, that's his protege protege.
00:57:11 That's the word made fully coolie.
00:57:13 And then he made Die Buster and it was it it capitalized on everything
00:57:18 that was great about the original in terms of like continuing the narrative
00:57:22 in an interesting way by continuing like the how they were.
00:57:25 Humanity has dealt with the threat of the space monsters post the black hole
00:57:30 bombs, you know, eruption, some unspecified time ago.
00:57:34 And oh, the fact they don't tell you when Die Buster takes place.
00:57:37 And then the ending, oh my God, and then as no, no, my favorite
00:57:41 wife of all time, besides Nika Robin.
00:57:43 Yes, you know, Kasia Sudamaki, that director, he just finally made another OVA.
00:57:49 Like what's what's the OVA early last early this year or late last year,
00:57:54 two episodes called Dragon Dentist.
00:57:57 And I haven't seen it yet, but I've heard it's fantastic.
00:58:00 But it's the first because he's one who's he's one who's been fucking up
00:58:04 on the Ava rebuild movies for 10 years, but he finally did something else.
00:58:08 And Dragon's Dentist.
00:58:10 That's very exciting.
00:58:10 I should watch them.
00:58:11 It was originally the first, you know, the the Studio Car Animator
00:58:14 Expo. Yes, Mimi me came from like the first one of those was the original
00:58:19 Dragon Dentist short and they expanded that into a two episode OVA.
00:58:23 I think each episode is like 45 minutes long, too.
00:58:25 I should watch all of those, including the original.
00:58:27 Well, I can do that guy is a legend and I fucking love him.
00:58:31 And Die Buster is like the coolest, comfiest, beautiful, love everything about it.
00:58:38 Anime of all time, great sequel, great sequel.
00:58:42 There you go. It can be done, everybody.
00:58:43 And I'm a big anti-sequel guy, but like there are times when the stars align
00:58:49 and people just do it right, which is why I would just I would heavily discourage
00:58:53 doing it. But if you're somebody who's got like a genius idea and you're like,
00:58:57 no, listen to me, here's my proposal for the sequel.
00:58:59 I am going to use the themes that were here and artistically show you how I'm
00:59:03 going to capitalize them and make them better than ever and more relevant and
00:59:06 emotionally tie my story into that one, then approve.
00:59:11 And that's why we're all looking forward to Fooly Cooly 2.
00:59:14 It's going to be the best thing ever.
00:59:16 Well, Kazia Saramaki is not directing that.
00:59:19 Yeah, unfortunately.
00:59:20 I believe the guy who directed Psycho Pass is directing Fooly Cooly 2.
00:59:23 Even if he was directing it, that wouldn't necessarily make me any.
00:59:26 Well, OK, it wouldn't help a little bit, but, you know, it's been 20 fucking years or whatever.
00:59:30 OK, I'm done. That's it. Die Buster.
00:59:34 Oh, man, Hippo, you got one?
00:59:36 Great sequel.
00:59:37 I've got a few.
00:59:39 Like I was trying to think because a lot of my favorite games just happened to be
00:59:43 the first in a series, but I do have one.
00:59:48 It's a it's a Shrek 2 the game on PC.
00:59:52 It's actually terrible.
00:59:53 Don't play any game of Shrek 2.
00:59:55 Oh, I just want to.
00:59:56 Incidentally, Davoo did map out a chart for us
00:59:59 of the quality of the Shrek films over time, which is very convenient that.
01:00:04 Yes, we'll see the problem with his.
01:00:06 Well, OK, it's the quality consensus chart.
01:00:10 Oh, right. Consensus is that Shrek 1 is above the good line.
01:00:14 Shrek 2 is way above the good line.
01:00:16 Shrek 3 is below the good line.
01:00:18 Yes. Shrek 4 is bottomed below the chart bad, right, as well as Puss in Boots.
01:00:24 But the problem with this, while this is the consensus, the consensus is wrong.
01:00:28 And Shrek 1 is in a horror film.
01:00:31 Absolutely untrue.
01:00:33 Shrek 1 is great.
01:00:35 Oh, man, everyone.
01:00:36 You watch it. Hi, everyone.
01:00:37 Go watch that.
01:00:38 No, that's why that.
01:00:40 Do you not know the story info that I know that's what you said?
01:00:43 That's why I watch it.
01:00:45 So it's just watching a hundred.
01:00:47 No, all you need to watch in that movie is the epic video on, I believe,
01:00:51 a little channel called Gibb and take that's Shrek without Shrek or like Shrek
01:00:54 until Shrek appears or whatever it is.
01:00:57 Yeah, it's Shrek.
01:00:58 But every time Shrek appears on screen, the movie.
01:01:01 Yeah, that's the one.
01:01:03 I give it literally is like some and that's the best bang of the outhouse opens
01:01:08 and cuts to black. Oh, fuck, it's the best.
01:01:11 It's the best.
01:01:13 I have like a movie one.
01:01:15 Lord of the Rings, the two towers, I think is the best Lord of the Rings film.
01:01:19 Oh, yeah.
01:01:20 It's it's it's so it's so I've seen it on TV too many times, though.
01:01:26 That makes it a bad movie that the personal problem, dude.
01:01:29 Yeah, you're not wrong. You're not wrong.
01:01:31 What about the second one makes it your favorite one?
01:01:33 The Riders of Rohan.
01:01:36 But the thing that the thing like the first one's great, obviously,
01:01:40 there's the there's the big there's the guy you shall not go across.
01:01:44 And it smashes the bridge and and you know, there's the Mines of Moria.
01:01:48 It's like really cool.
01:01:50 The Nazgul, you know, he's got the second one has the trees
01:01:55 and the Saruman and the big attack.
01:01:57 And it's got the Battle of Helms deep.
01:01:59 I was about to say Jesus Christ, that's a big castle.
01:02:04 Helms deep is the obvious, the most obvious reason.
01:02:08 I think for me, it's hard to separate the three
01:02:11 because like I think all of them have strengths and weaknesses
01:02:14 that have to do with the fact that they are part of a series.
01:02:17 Like to me, I'd prefer to think of that as one nine hour story as opposed to sequels.
01:02:22 Well, like true. They're kind of all one.
01:02:25 Like there's there's nothing significantly different about them.
01:02:27 They're all just like the same story being told across three movies.
01:02:31 You know, I guess.
01:02:32 But the way I've always like felt is that, you know,
01:02:35 the first two were sort of out when I was young.
01:02:37 And then the third one took a while to come out and it had elephants and weird things.
01:02:42 And I just like that there's ghosts here.
01:02:43 I don't understand what's going on.
01:02:45 I didn't understand any of it.
01:02:46 So I didn't like that.
01:02:47 I thought the Hobbit unexpected journey was good,
01:02:50 but the desolation of Smough really really kicked things up a notch.
01:02:55 That's actually the opposite.
01:02:57 Like I liked that first Hobbit movie, but the second one I just gave up.
01:03:01 That's what I hear people.
01:03:02 Watch the third one. Yeah, yeah.
01:03:04 I still like it.
01:03:07 Delete yourselves.
01:03:09 Yeah, I've heard the third one.
01:03:10 Where do they kill the fucking dragon?
01:03:12 Which one is that at the very beginning of the third one?
01:03:14 Which is why it's the worst.
01:03:16 That's why that's also why it's the entire second movie is entirely dedicated
01:03:21 to hunting the dragon and it ends before they fucking fight it on a total anti-climax.
01:03:26 It is the shittiest ending I've ever seen.
01:03:29 Five minutes into the next one, they just kill it.
01:03:31 And it's just why didn't you just have the movie be five extra minutes?
01:03:34 Because they know it's the worst one and they wanted people to fucking see it.
01:03:37 You're not wrong, you're not wrong.
01:03:38 It kind of reminds me of like in the Gurren Logan like film adaptations of the show.
01:03:43 Like so the whole fight, this is like the most disgusting thing ever.
01:03:47 Like the first film ends like at the point where like Simone becomes a man,
01:03:50 which is like a fantastic climax, but then they compress the entire battle
01:03:54 against Lord Genome, which was like literally the best part of the entire show
01:03:58 except for the actual final climax and they make a fucking clip show out of it
01:04:02 at the beginning of the second movie.
01:04:03 What the fuck were they thinking?
01:04:06 What a mistake. What a fucking mistake.
01:04:07 Wait, did they I thought there was like a super fucking well animated version
01:04:10 of the fight with Genome in the second movie?
01:04:12 Absolutely not.
01:04:13 Like he walks down the front of his mech and all that.
01:04:15 That happens in the movie, that happens in the show too.
01:04:18 And maybe I'm thinking of the show then.
01:04:21 Yeah, I mean, the show fight is fantastic.
01:04:23 It's it's like one of the best points of the whole show.
01:04:25 But, you know, they fucked up in the movie.
01:04:28 Trust me.
01:04:29 In terms of in terms of video games, I can't really decide between
01:04:35 Wretched and Clank 2, Sly 2, Sly 3 and Ape Escape 2.
01:04:39 So all of those are like like really good.
01:04:42 The thing about I think video game sequels have a much higher propensity
01:04:45 for being like better because you don't necessarily
01:04:49 just use the the stories and stuff.
01:04:50 Yeah. And you're usually like really tweaking the game play.
01:04:55 By the way, guys, I just wanted to to let you know, I'm looking here
01:04:58 on the wiki for the Hobbit films.
01:05:00 The total budget for all three films was six hundred and twenty five
01:05:04 million dollars for all three of these films.
01:05:07 Just as bad as I would have thought, actually, for all three.
01:05:11 For all. Yeah, it's all three combined.
01:05:13 Look at the fucking look at the cost of like pirates three.
01:05:17 I will. That movie is like three hundred and fifty million dollars by itself.
01:05:22 All right, you reminded me of pirates.
01:05:24 The second one is not second.
01:05:27 The second one is no way.
01:05:29 The second was no, as soon as Johnny, not Johnny Depp,
01:05:32 fucking as soon as yeah, the second or third one are not great.
01:05:34 The first one is a legend and I love it.
01:05:36 The first one is amazing.
01:05:37 But I think second and third as like a as like a sequence
01:05:42 to each other. I mean, actually, it's they're good.
01:05:45 It's a fascinating example, actually, because the entire Pirates of the Caribbean
01:05:48 idea is based on a fucking ride at Disneyland and they made it into a movie.
01:05:53 So they just obviously had some like good script writers or somebody who thought
01:05:57 like, yeah, let's make a fun action adventure.
01:05:59 And then like it was the further corporatization as like those ideas dried up
01:06:03 and then like Davey Jones or something. Fine, do that.
01:06:06 And it was not as good. Yeah.
01:06:09 I got to watch them again.
01:06:10 Yeah, the first one is great.
01:06:12 The first one is so good.
01:06:14 I watched it recently.
01:06:15 It definitely holds up.
01:06:16 But this is just just a little bit of a level does not hold up though.
01:06:21 I like it.
01:06:22 The like there's like a part in the third one.
01:06:26 I remember liking the third one because of how stupid and complicated it is.
01:06:31 And and and all the like the crisscrossing alignments and like the stuff.
01:06:35 It is like, oh, I feel so smart.
01:06:37 This is the great Gatsby guy.
01:06:41 I'm really you really need a high IQ to understand the parts of the Caribbean
01:06:45 three. Right. Very true.
01:06:47 Four is four is way off.
01:06:50 Get out of it. I heard five was OK, though.
01:06:53 There that was what I haven't even seen it.
01:06:55 I just go. I just watched.
01:06:56 I thought I heard Jesse. Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
01:06:58 I think Jesse liked it.
01:07:00 So I've been just kind of combing through my favorites list.
01:07:04 And I've got two sequels.
01:07:05 I got to mention the first one and this one I'm hesitant to count.
01:07:09 But it's K on season two.
01:07:12 And the reason I'm hesitant to count it is that it's just continuing to adapt
01:07:14 to the manga, you know, it came out a year later.
01:07:17 It's essentially just a second season.
01:07:19 But the ramp up in production value for season two and just the way that
01:07:26 it's so clear they were taking it more seriously is what makes like it's
01:07:30 when you get to season two that K on really starts to feel like a masterpiece.
01:07:33 You know, yeah, like the first season is really good.
01:07:36 And especially rewatching it when you know all the characters.
01:07:39 It's a ton of fun.
01:07:40 But season two is where it gets like it becomes Kino, essentially, you know,
01:07:44 it's it's really interesting thinking about that as like an idea,
01:07:48 because like in real world terms, season two is a sequel.
01:07:52 And you would think and talk about it as a sequel,
01:07:54 but it is just continuing.
01:07:56 Yeah, something that would have been there.
01:07:57 Like you if you get rid of season two, it's like Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.
01:08:00 It is just one.
01:08:01 But it is a new project, you know, because they like re you know, they're like,
01:08:04 yeah, but what I'm et cetera, et cetera.
01:08:06 What I'm getting at is like, there's like, should a sequel be something
01:08:10 that was not necessarily planned and then they decide to do.
01:08:15 That's kind of how I tend to think.
01:08:17 Like if I mean, if the manga is one ongoing work and the two seasons
01:08:22 of the anime are basically the same, it's just like, like, for instance,
01:08:27 Food Wars is a show that's airing its third season right now.
01:08:30 And like if you watch all of Food Wars all the way through,
01:08:33 you're not going to notice like a huge difference across the three seasons.
01:08:37 It's more like, oh, we're just doing another one.
01:08:39 You know, like the last one was successful
01:08:41 enough that we can do another chunk, but it's all the same manga.
01:08:44 It's all the same story.
01:08:45 Whereas, for instance, a Ghost in the Shell standalone complex season two.
01:08:49 It's an original show.
01:08:50 And like while it's cribbing a lot of ideas from the same manga,
01:08:53 like it's a it's a whole new script that they had to create from scratch
01:08:57 and like tell a whole different story based on having made the first one.
01:09:01 So I tend to think of that as more of a sequel.
01:09:03 In Kayon's case, like like half of the anime is original content, if not more.
01:09:09 In fact, in season two, almost all of it's original to the show,
01:09:12 because they're adapting two volumes of manga into 26 episodes of anime.
01:09:18 And like just adding in tons of shit and making it more cinematic.
01:09:21 So like to me, it's not a sequel in the sense of like,
01:09:25 oh, it's a different story, but it's a sequel in the sense of
01:09:28 the first season allowed us to do this with season two.
01:09:32 Like now we can make it the show.
01:09:33 It was always like could have been like realized the potential of it,
01:09:37 which is kind of what we're saying.
01:09:38 Video game sequels allow you to do right so much, you know,
01:09:41 which brings me to my second example.
01:09:44 Dark Souls 3 fucking per like even I would even have said
01:09:50 Dark Souls is a spiritual sequel to Demon's Souls, pretty obviously.
01:09:55 And Bloodborne as a spiritual sequel to Dark Souls, all fantastic.
01:09:59 But there is enough of a leap in style.
01:10:01 Dark Souls 3 is just straight up.
01:10:03 It's it's the new Dark Souls and it's fucking amazing.
01:10:07 I enjoyed it.
01:10:09 Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt,
01:10:11 but I just I don't want to bring up something about that.
01:10:13 So you and I and Jesse did our Dark Souls 3 PCP a while ago.
01:10:16 And like we all agree that it's fantastic and we loved it.
01:10:19 And that was even before the DLC came out that made it even better.
01:10:21 And I just wanted to ask, have you seen I'm quite perplexed by like,
01:10:26 I see a level of negativity on Dark Souls 3 out in the world
01:10:29 that absolutely baffles me.
01:10:32 And I don't know what the nature of it is,
01:10:34 but I see all the time rankings of like Dark Souls 3 like way below
01:10:38 like above Dark Souls 2, but way below one.
01:10:40 And I don't understand why I think I could understand it
01:10:44 if you are someone who plays the games over and over and over again
01:10:47 because Dark Souls 3 definitely has less choice.
01:10:50 Yeah, that's not wrong.
01:10:51 Like, like I feel like personally,
01:10:54 Dark Souls 1 is like easy to just go back to and on the other hand,
01:10:57 despite having less stuff, the game feel is improved.
01:11:00 And like online play, obviously, is way easier.
01:11:03 So like there's if you're just talking about easier,
01:11:05 but is it as do people enjoy it as much?
01:11:07 Like, yeah, there's there's always there's like because
01:11:10 when it comes to stuff like that, where people play it ad nauseam forever,
01:11:14 it really changes their opinions of it.
01:11:16 You know, it's kind of like how you have people who
01:11:19 like anybody who has ever been ever a fan of League of Legends.
01:11:24 If they were into it for more than a couple of years,
01:11:27 then their opinion of it is that it's the worst game ever made,
01:11:30 but they've played thousands of hours of it.
01:11:32 Oh, my God. Yeah, go ahead.
01:11:34 Good because like you can't you can't develop
01:11:36 like like when you're first playing it,
01:11:39 you're just seeing it for what it is.
01:11:40 Like it's a fun game.
01:11:41 But like as you begin to see all the ones and zeros in the matrix
01:11:45 and you really like analyze everything about it,
01:11:47 you'll find reasons to not like it and stuff.
01:11:49 And I think with with Dark Souls,
01:11:52 that game just had so many weird things in it that you could do
01:11:56 and so much sequence breaking that like you can play it over and over again
01:11:59 and usually have somewhat of a different experience.
01:12:02 You know, Dark Souls 3 doesn't have that ability in the same way.
01:12:05 But I'm not someone who's ever going to play a game
01:12:07 more than once every year or two.
01:12:09 So that doesn't affect me at all.
01:12:11 You know, on that way, I would see.
01:12:13 OK, go on.
01:12:14 The way I would see Dark Souls 3 is is like the undertale
01:12:17 of the Dark Souls franchise in that it's a great game to play through.
01:12:22 But it's I don't need to go back and play Undertale again.
01:12:25 Like it's not that sort of a game.
01:12:27 Dark Souls of the Undertale franchise, you know, what?
01:12:30 Homestuck Act 5, which is what I was going to say is my favorite.
01:12:35 But my might be the best sequel to an act in Homestuck was Act 5, Act 2.
01:12:40 That's the literal peak of which one is that hippo hippo.
01:12:44 So hold on, we need to clarify this before this becomes the main comment on the video.
01:12:48 What you mean by I don't have to go back and play Undertale again
01:12:51 is like in the like after having played it five times, right?
01:12:55 Like like it's a game that necessitates playing it over and over again.
01:13:00 For at least I mean, I mean, once you've done the stuff,
01:13:02 yeah, there's no that the gameplay is not something you would go back to.
01:13:06 Not that I'm saying that wasn't the comment we get.
01:13:09 I'm not saying in that way that Dark Souls 3
01:13:13 isn't fun to play like mechanically.
01:13:15 It's just like I would love like just to play just running around
01:13:19 and hitting things in Dark Souls 3.
01:13:21 But going through the levels again is like, yeah, been through them
01:13:24 in the exact same way every time.
01:13:26 You're not wrong.
01:13:27 Yeah, I did it because I played through it twice the second time
01:13:30 just to do the big sequence break of like fighting the dancer first
01:13:34 because it's easy to do that in New Game Plus.
01:13:36 But yeah, beyond that, there's not like a radically like Dark Souls one
01:13:42 that game kept getting better as time passed
01:13:45 because you kept learning about new crazy shit you could do with it.
01:13:48 Like that was what got me so hype about the game,
01:13:50 even though I hadn't even played it for a long time.
01:13:53 Let's just seeing people like put together videos of like,
01:13:56 here's everything you can do before the gargoyles
01:13:58 and it's like a crazy amount of shit you could do.
01:14:01 And he's like, oh, my God, have you seen that streamer?
01:14:04 I forget his name who does like a challenge runs
01:14:06 and he's done like every single challenge run possible,
01:14:08 like not using the left analog stick or the right analog stick
01:14:12 to move the camera and like just plays the whole game like that.
01:14:14 Fascinating or playing with incredible with the fucking rock band drums.
01:14:18 You know, though, this completely reminds me of a sequel
01:14:21 that I suppose Dabuster 2 is my favorite sequel ever,
01:14:25 but only because of like the whatever doesn't matter.
01:14:27 But the point is, I was going to say,
01:14:29 Kingdom Hearts 2 is also a tremendous sequel
01:14:32 that is one of my favorite things in the world.
01:14:33 And it's interesting what you were saying, Digi,
01:14:36 about like the whole replay issue of playing things over and over.
01:14:39 And Kingdom Hearts 2 is so fascinating
01:14:41 because it is kind of the absolute most boring the first time you play it.
01:14:45 And every time you play it afterward,
01:14:47 it gets better and better and better
01:14:49 because the core fundamentals of the gameplay are so unbelievably tight
01:14:54 and scientific and calculated and perfected in that game
01:14:58 that you've got these massive communities. Yes, you're going to have to
01:15:01 like when we live in the same city, you're going to have to sit me down
01:15:05 and like guide me through Kingdom Hearts 2.
01:15:08 The only way I'm ever going to play it is if you sit there next to me
01:15:11 and like explain to me everything about the game while I'm playing.
01:15:16 That's the only way I'll enjoy it. I would be so thrilled to do that.
01:15:19 But I'll give you a quick tip.
01:15:20 The first time I played it was a friend of mine trying to force me to play it.
01:15:24 Like the same way he sat next to me,
01:15:26 but he didn't explain anything because he's terrible at explaining things.
01:15:29 So I just sat there and complained about it for four hours and he laughed.
01:15:33 Yes, I suffered.
01:15:34 I'll give you a quick tip, though,
01:15:35 that will aid you and anyone else out there who wants to get into Kingdom Hearts 2
01:15:39 and not suffer through it.
01:15:41 Just literally skip every cutscene.
01:15:43 Just skip them all. Don't give a shit.
01:15:45 Oh, thank you.
01:15:46 Holy shit. Just do that.
01:15:47 That's the greatest permission anyone has ever given me for a game.
01:15:52 Yeah. Oh, my God.
01:15:53 Skip every single one.
01:15:54 Now I want to play it.
01:15:55 Yeah, and you will have fun.
01:15:57 You'll have fun if you just follow this one simple tip of not giving a fuck
01:16:00 about anything anyone says in that game.
01:16:04 The man who did the full presentation on the story of Kingdom Hearts,
01:16:07 advocating, I mean, all of the cuts.
01:16:09 There's a time that's just his ploy to get to watch that video.
01:16:13 That video, like the takeaway for the video was none of this shit matters.
01:16:17 That's why there's there's a time solving you.
01:16:19 There's a time when you when when a man is forced to face the reality
01:16:23 of the human psyche and just say no one wants to sit through this shit.
01:16:27 We've just got to I want people to play Kingdom Hearts 2,
01:16:29 but I understand the reality that no one fucking wants to
01:16:32 unless they skip all of this shit.
01:16:33 You are legitimately a hero for that.
01:16:35 There are not many fans of a game who will tell you that.
01:16:39 Well, you know what?
01:16:40 Yeah, it's because I've watched a lot of speed runs and like the speed run community.
01:16:43 Like, yeah, they don't give a shit.
01:16:44 They just they just like those people just want to get to to the fun stuff.
01:16:48 And like here, let me just give you a little taste of one of the fascinating
01:16:51 things that you discover about Kingdom Hearts 2.
01:16:53 If you dig past like all this bullshit on the top,
01:16:55 there is a concept called revenge values as it's been termed by the community,
01:16:59 which is this thing where every boss.
01:17:02 OK, so this is a huge difference between like birth by sleep and Kingdom Hearts
01:17:06 2 that the retards who love birth by sleep don't understand.
01:17:09 And it's that in birth by sleep, like enemies never get stunned
01:17:12 no matter what you hit them with.
01:17:13 They never get stunned, whereas in Kingdom Hearts 2,
01:17:15 enemies bosses specifically can get stunned all the times.
01:17:18 And this is what makes boss fights fun.
01:17:20 Enemy bosses can get stunned, but they have this thing called a revenge value.
01:17:23 And it's specifically that when they're stunned,
01:17:25 if you hit them a certain number of times, like like five or 10 or whatever,
01:17:29 at that point, they will immediately snap out of being stunned and start fighting again.
01:17:33 So it's it's managing the enemy's revenge values in very particular ways
01:17:37 that allows you optimize the damage you're dealing to them and utilize certain
01:17:40 strategies are as like this is the most advanced way to be a speed runner
01:17:45 and calculate how to like scientifically beat from the best while feeling
01:17:48 like a Kingdom Hearts keyblade slinging God.
01:17:50 That's what makes Kingdom Hearts 2 so much fun.
01:17:52 Find out this kind of shit.
01:17:53 But there you go.
01:17:55 Oh, anyway, Tom, what's a sequel you really like?
01:17:58 Did we get to you yet?
01:18:00 Yeah, I said Zone of the Unders, second runner.
01:18:02 Oh, right. You went first.
01:18:03 I do have a another kind of topic I wanted to bring up
01:18:07 and see if you guys had any thoughts on.
01:18:08 OK, this specifically deals with game sequels,
01:18:11 but I suppose it can apply to anything because there are some games that I really like.
01:18:17 The two the three examples that really come to mind are Devil May Cry, Halo,
01:18:21 and to an extent, I guess Ninja Gaiden, but not as much
01:18:25 because there's only two games in that series before they got chickened.
01:18:28 But like when you have you enjoy the first game
01:18:30 and it has like a specific feel and then the sequel tweaks the feel significantly.
01:18:36 And then that just becomes the default feel for the series.
01:18:39 And then you kind of lose a little bit of what made the first one great
01:18:42 because you play Devil May Cry one, then you play three because two doesn't exist.
01:18:47 And the feel is way different.
01:18:49 Like you have the style system, the way the work is different.
01:18:53 And then and then you go to four and four feels exactly the same.
01:18:57 And then you play Halo one to Halo two, Halo two overfines everything.
01:19:00 It changes the way it feels.
01:19:01 Then three feels exactly the same.
01:19:03 It's the very same way. Yeah. Yeah.
01:19:05 I totally know what you mean.
01:19:07 So like, do you guys do you experience that?
01:19:09 What are your thoughts on that?
01:19:10 Because I definitely feel like there's a little bit that's lost in that transition sometimes.
01:19:14 I can't think of many examples where it's worse.
01:19:18 After like, I mean, in a game like Devil May Cry,
01:19:21 like obviously they tried to change things for the second one and it failed.
01:19:24 They changed things back to the first one, but a little different and it worked.
01:19:28 And like everyone considers Devil May Cry three to be the best Devil May Cry.
01:19:32 So like, even though I think one and three are both worth playing
01:19:35 because they're so different, like, I think it's, you know,
01:19:40 three is going to be the one everybody loves.
01:19:41 And so, of course, they're going to copy that when they make the sequel,
01:19:44 though it's almost a shame to not keep experimenting,
01:19:47 which Devil May Cry 4 does with Nero's grabbing abilities and stuff.
01:19:51 I think Nero is like way more fun than playing as Dante to be.
01:19:54 Yeah, the Devil May Cry is just fucking great.
01:19:56 Yeah, I don't know if you've watched the gaming Brits like endless videos
01:20:00 on Devil May Cry, but you should. You should, yeah.
01:20:03 I have pretty great.
01:20:03 It's his purpose in life.
01:20:05 He just became a cooler person because.
01:20:07 His main thing is he talks about Devil May.
01:20:09 Like you can watch his whole, like you can watch the video
01:20:12 where he gets into the franchise and then the video from a year later
01:20:16 where he's like an expert in it.
01:20:17 And then you watch him just continually never shut up about it
01:20:20 over the course of the rest of his video.
01:20:21 But to your point there, Tom, like I said before,
01:20:24 Kingdom Hearts 2 really did the same thing that you're describing
01:20:27 that like Devil May Cry 3 did to its series.
01:20:30 And I always say when I'm talking about these games,
01:20:32 Kingdom Hearts 1 and Kingdom Hearts 2 are by far the best games in that series.
01:20:36 And obviously I like Kingdom Hearts 2 overall, but even Kingdom Hearts 2,
01:20:40 excuse me, lost a lot of what made Kingdom Hearts 1 really good,
01:20:44 like specifically like the platforming challenges that, you know,
01:20:47 you get abilities to overcome.
01:20:49 And so like there has been an abandonment of a lot of the stuff
01:20:52 that made Kingdom Hearts 1 good, even though they have at no point since,
01:20:56 you know, since after Kingdom Hearts 2,
01:20:58 have they reached the level of quality that Kingdom Hearts 1 or 2 was at.
01:21:01 So like and it does frustrate me that it seems like there's people
01:21:05 stupidly trying to just recreate Kingdom Hearts 2 over and over again
01:21:09 without like knowing how or really like doing the research
01:21:11 into what made that game good.
01:21:13 And like nobody's paying attention at all to like what made Kingdom Hearts 1
01:21:17 good because we've all just moved on because there's like sequels.
01:21:19 And that's super frustrating.
01:21:20 And so I totally get the the feeling you're talking about.
01:21:24 Another franchise that did this in Hippo.
01:21:26 I'd be curious to know if you think this was if you think anything was lost
01:21:30 in the transition here, Ratchet and Clank,
01:21:33 because the first first and second Ratchet and Clank games feel pretty fucking different.
01:21:37 The second game really refocuses as a shooter and and all the ones from then on.
01:21:42 I think the way I see Ratchet and Clank 2 is an improvement
01:21:47 on absolutely everything in Ratchet and Clank 1.
01:21:49 I agree. Just like and it got rid of or no,
01:21:52 it expanded on the things that Ratchet and Clank 1 had like bits of and bits of
01:21:57 like the the spaceship battles.
01:21:58 There's just two parts of that in Ratchet and Clank 1 and in Ratchet and Clank 2.
01:22:02 It's now a mode. It's like a mini game.
01:22:05 So I think that was like in like that.
01:22:08 If that was the status quo for like the PS3 games, that would have been good.
01:22:11 You know, if all the PS3 games were like Ratchet and Clank 2, you're right about that.
01:22:15 I like that. But what the fuck about Jack like Jack 1 versus Jack 2?
01:22:19 Talk about a transformation.
01:22:21 But it's but it's Jack 3.
01:22:23 Isn't Jack 3 also a huge transformation from Jack 2?
01:22:26 So it's not like the reality is really is an interesting thing.
01:22:30 Jack like when I was a little baby boy
01:22:33 and I didn't know what video games were and I just played them.
01:22:35 What a hellish existence. I had Jack 1.
01:22:37 I had I had Jack 1 and then Jack 2 came out
01:22:40 and I got Jack 2 and it was so different.
01:22:43 But I didn't know that sequels were supposed to feel kind of the same.
01:22:46 So I just thought it was cool and then Jack 3 came out as the same sort of thing.
01:22:50 So I don't really I don't know.
01:22:53 I think that the main thing was Jack 1 was a platformer through and through.
01:22:57 Just about jumping and punching and jumping and jumping.
01:23:02 And then Jack 2 introduced vehicles, guns,
01:23:06 edgy like transformation sequences
01:23:10 and Jack 3 also has those things.
01:23:13 I want to I think I think like for the
01:23:18 it's cool. I like it. I don't dislike it at all.
01:23:21 I want to jump into Tom was saying this might just be for video games.
01:23:24 But no, it's definitely true of like long running franchises that this happens.
01:23:29 And it can be really fascinating.
01:23:31 For instance, I think Dragon Ball kind of had.
01:23:34 Oh, yeah, of course, original Dragon Ball is like a funny little adventure
01:23:38 comedy and then like everything since then is like epic.
01:23:42 What's funny about a huge fucking conversation with my friend about how
01:23:46 Goku is a terrible main character because of that transition.
01:23:50 I had a whole video about that.
01:23:51 He did. And you know, it's funny, though, is that that transformation
01:23:54 actually wasn't even within a sequel like in Japan.
01:23:57 That's just Dragon Ball like all the way up just happened.
01:23:59 Yeah, but then Dragon Ball Super.
01:24:02 It does feel like a very stark contrast.
01:24:04 I mean, they kept the same name in the manga, but like Dragon Ball was supposed to end.
01:24:09 Oh, was it really? OK.
01:24:10 They made him. It was supposed to end multiple times.
01:24:13 Like the story behind Dragon Ball is pretty fucked.
01:24:15 I only know like this very surface details.
01:24:18 But like Goku was supposed to die and Gohan was supposed to be the main character
01:24:21 after Cell. Hey, question. Back.
01:24:24 Just the thing I remember was that the way Dragon Ball ends is very,
01:24:29 very similar to the way Dragon Ball Z ends, which is like he just goes off
01:24:33 and he's implied to have more adventures, but he just doesn't want to talk about.
01:24:36 Yeah, right. And that's what Dragon Ball was going to be ending there.
01:24:39 But then he came back and there was.
01:24:41 Hey, does Dragon Ball end with Goku as an adult or is he still a kid?
01:24:45 I he's he's like a young adult.
01:24:47 He's like in his 20s. Yeah.
01:24:49 Yeah, like I remember him.
01:24:50 I thought he had his final fight with like King Piccolo.
01:24:52 That was the thing.
01:24:53 He had he had his final fight with King Piccolo with Piccolo's son,
01:24:58 who we know as Piccolo. Oh, right.
01:25:00 Yeah, like the great Demon King Piccolo was like the big bad guy of Dragon Ball.
01:25:06 And he beat him and then his son came back and they fought in the martial arts
01:25:09 tournament and then Chichi came and said, you promised me we'd marry.
01:25:13 And then they went off and we didn't see the wedding in the manga.
01:25:16 But that's like now Goku's going to get married and that's the end of Dragon Ball.
01:25:20 Bye. So did he end with Piccolo's son on friendly terms?
01:25:23 I mean, obviously we see how Dragon Ball Z.
01:25:25 I know I get into Dragon Ball.
01:25:26 I'm just curious.
01:25:28 They don't end on friendly terms, they hate each other.
01:25:30 Yeah, like it starts.
01:25:31 They start with Raditz because they're they're not their enemies, right?
01:25:34 They're right.
01:25:34 He has to like, right, right.
01:25:36 The thing was like a Goku, like the son of Piccolo,
01:25:41 I keep thinking of him as that because that's what he is.
01:25:43 Because he came out of an egg.
01:25:45 He he came to the martial arts tournament
01:25:49 and he tried to kill everyone and Goku eventually beat him.
01:25:52 But then he says, you know,
01:25:55 he got a Senzu bean is like, thanks, guys, I won.
01:25:58 I won the tournament finally.
01:26:00 That's that's literally canonically the first time he won the tourney.
01:26:03 Because he's still played by the rules right until the very end,
01:26:06 even though fucking everyone was evacuated and everything was destroyed.
01:26:10 But then he gave a Senzu bean to Piccolo and Piccolo was like,
01:26:13 really, and he just ran away.
01:26:15 So it's like it's implied that he will be a villain forever.
01:26:19 But he's he's like, oh, I respect you or something.
01:26:22 That's cool. That's cool.
01:26:24 I'm trying to think of some more examples of this.
01:26:27 Another one that is kind of like that is Ghost in the Shell,
01:26:31 just in that like the original manga is so much goofier
01:26:35 than like any other adaptation of it.
01:26:38 Like the original manga definitely has way more of a sense of humor
01:26:42 and more like loose with its characters and designs and everything.
01:26:45 And it's like it's just more of a pulp adventure with like really hard sci-fi.
01:26:51 You are 100 percent right.
01:26:52 It's just that like I in my mind,
01:26:55 I have them so partitioned as like different,
01:26:57 like like real alternate universes as opposed to sequels.
01:26:59 But you're not wrong. I mean, yeah.
01:27:01 I mean, some some of those sequels we're talking about.
01:27:06 I guess all all the ones we've talked about like a rise is obviously like different
01:27:09 and then stand alone complex like like the major herself is like totally different.
01:27:13 I know it's a prequel and it's all fucked up.
01:27:15 And yeah, but like just just the idea of how the franchise
01:27:20 like if the original film had been like more accurate to the manga's tone.
01:27:26 Yeah, then I feel like it was not at all like I don't know if it would have become a success.
01:27:31 But like whether it did or not,
01:27:32 that's probably how Ghost in the Shell would have been from then on.
01:27:35 Right. Like not that the TV show is exactly like the movie or anything.
01:27:38 Like the TV show definitely adds more levity in.
01:27:41 But like the fact that it even is such a serious military show.
01:27:45 Oh, yeah. Like like it's because that movie had set the press.
01:27:49 Like, that's what people identify in Ghost in the Shell.
01:27:51 In Ghost in the Shell, the major is way more informed as a character
01:27:54 by the movie's Motoko than the manga's Motoko. No doubt, no doubt.
01:27:58 The manga's Motoko is just like a goofy, like she is the best version of Motoko.
01:28:02 She's always got like boyfriends and stuff.
01:28:03 She is great. It's great.
01:28:05 I fucking love her. I like I like them all.
01:28:07 I like them all.
01:28:08 She fucks around and cracks jokes and like it's just way way more human.
01:28:12 Is a literal sex worker.
01:28:13 A literal sex worker makes sex software.
01:28:15 It's great. She's the best.
01:28:17 Yeah. Well, shit, guys.
01:28:19 Are we are we done? Are we done with the questions?
01:28:21 I think we can't we can't have a podcast about sequels
01:28:25 without taking a stab at our good friend, Mel Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain.
01:28:30 Oh, of course. I hate you forever.
01:28:32 Of course. And and and that's that's the biggest disappointment
01:28:36 after Definitely Cry was Mel Gear. I hate you.
01:28:40 Oh, you fucking fanboys.
01:28:42 Why can't you just turn off your brain and enjoy this sequel like the rest of us?
01:28:45 What the fuck? Let's get into questions.
01:28:48 Student of Ethereum says on a scale of one to ten, which
01:28:52 I pick oh, wait, I say a little academia, little academia.
01:28:57 Got him. Got him.
01:28:59 Yeah. Enough of that.
01:29:02 I'm interested in this. OK.
01:29:05 This guy just seems concerned for like concerned for us.
01:29:08 That's why I'm getting out of this.
01:29:09 OK. Me cool man asks, when was the last time you talked to your parents?
01:29:15 For me, it was like today.
01:29:16 For me, it was like four days ago.
01:29:18 I talked to them for like a whole hour on the phone.
01:29:20 I don't talk to my parents that I can go like months without talking to my parents,
01:29:25 really, which is not great.
01:29:26 But I have recently communicated with him over the fact that we're using
01:29:30 too much data on our phone plan.
01:29:32 So yeah, my dad, my dad has like a 45 minute commute to and from work right now.
01:29:40 So like every month or so, he'll remember like, oh, why don't I just call
01:29:45 Digi while he's on his way home?
01:29:47 He doesn't call me Digi, but you know, right?
01:29:49 He calls you Digi Brony, your real name.
01:29:55 Oh, I only want to know Nate's answer to this.
01:29:58 If you were a girl, would you use your body for money?
01:30:01 Not necessarily prostitution, though.
01:30:03 I would argue that it's almost impossible for a girl to not use her body for money
01:30:08 just as she goes about life.
01:30:10 Righter answer that I ever could have hoped for.
01:30:16 All right, here's what we could all answer.
01:30:18 The gobs ask, what was the spookiest thing to you when you were a kid?
01:30:23 That could be a whole podcast, honestly.
01:30:25 You're not wrong.
01:30:26 Yeah, that should have been the Halloween one.
01:30:27 Yeah, what the fuck's wrong with that?
01:30:29 Well, this won't even be out for another week anyway.
01:30:32 Spookiest thing is, I mean, like the rare occasion when I was a kid,
01:30:37 when I saw a actual horror movie, when I was a kid,
01:30:40 I was much more susceptible to them.
01:30:42 So like I remember being young and I saw this movie starring Harrison Ford
01:30:46 called What Lies Beneath.
01:30:48 And this movie, it was sort of it was about like a wife with a cheating husband,
01:30:51 professor guy, and like he was sort of like the murderer, bad guy,
01:30:55 because like he had like killed a girl that he had had an affair with long ago.
01:30:57 So he was kind of the murderer.
01:30:59 And like some of the imagery from that movie stuck with me for years
01:31:03 and really fucked me up.
01:31:04 Like whenever there was like a darkness that I had to walk through,
01:31:07 I would imagine like Harrison Ford was going to fucking come and kill me.
01:31:10 You know, things of that nature, things of that nature.
01:31:13 It was good.
01:31:13 Similar for me, I mean, this was not when I was a little kid.
01:31:16 I had lots of like little childhood trauma like things I'd seen that like haunted me.
01:31:21 But like in terms of what made me afraid to go into the dark,
01:31:24 blood the last vampire with the Corruptorans.
01:31:27 Oh, really?
01:31:29 Because we had kind of like a sort of a meme.
01:31:32 But me and my brother Victor, because I saw the movie
01:31:35 and I was like probably eleven and he would have been like ten.
01:31:40 And we watched it with my cousin, Boyd, who was four years older.
01:31:43 And like we would play this game where if it was a dark night and we were all hanging out,
01:31:47 we would try to see how far into the darkness we were willing to walk.
01:31:51 Like how far into the dark you willing to go before the Corruptorans get you, essentially.
01:31:55 And like so like Victor would start walking into the darkness and then Boyd would go,
01:31:59 oh, Corruptoran.
01:32:01 We all go, oh, we run away.
01:32:03 I don't think we were so young that we like legitimately thought Corruptorans
01:32:07 were going to eat us, but we were spook.
01:32:08 We were easily spooked kids.
01:32:10 That's hilarious. Never dealt with horror.
01:32:12 Well, by the way, are these all questions coming from our beloved PCP Discord channel?
01:32:16 Yes, they are.
01:32:17 If you are a PCP Patreon discord, yes, that that thing.
01:32:22 Given what spooked you as a as a kid.
01:32:25 This question is from the gobs, by the way.
01:32:28 I that I was thinking and there was this very
01:32:31 what is the question was from the Corruptorans and their back.
01:32:34 They're coming for you.
01:32:39 This one thing on Newgrounds, I saw this flash animation
01:32:42 and it was it was it forever.
01:32:45 Well, I'll just explain what happens.
01:32:47 It's like a brightly lit kitchen and there's just a guy walking in.
01:32:51 There's like stuff on the TV and it's like you can see outside.
01:32:55 It's like dark.
01:32:56 It's like nighttime.
01:32:57 It's just the window is black because it's dark outside and he's just coming in.
01:33:00 He's fixing some cereal or just getting going to bite to eat his little snack.
01:33:05 And, you know, he's just watching TV and nothing happens for like 45 seconds.
01:33:09 And you're just sitting there is like what what what is this?
01:33:13 And then suddenly out of nowhere, because you know how Newgrounds flash animations,
01:33:18 you can't like turn the volume.
01:33:20 You can't pause it.
01:33:20 You can't click on it.
01:33:21 You can't change the volume unless it's on like you're you're turning the knob on your own speaker thing.
01:33:27 So it was just an extremely loud monster smashes through the kitchen window,
01:33:33 grabs the guy and brings him out in like like three frames.
01:33:36 And from then on, every time I was in the kitchen and I saw that it was dark out,
01:33:42 I thought that would happen to me.
01:33:43 And I just stayed really far away from the window for like for like years.
01:33:48 Because it was such a specific like normal setting
01:33:53 and it was really tense and suspenseful.
01:33:54 I don't know what I feel like the guy
01:33:56 would expect us to say just like clowns or like werewolves.
01:33:59 But it's just like, no, this very specific flash animation from newgrounds.com.
01:34:03 Scared the shit out of me.
01:34:04 He's dealing with it. Yeah, I know.
01:34:06 I mean, I ruined Shade's life one time by showing him.
01:34:11 There was one of those.
01:34:12 It was just like a a flasher or whatever they're called when you put
01:34:16 what's it called when you put like a sudden loud screamer screamer.
01:34:19 Yeah, that's the one.
01:34:20 I there was this one thing that was a it was wears Waldo.
01:34:24 And like after like 10 seconds, it's a screamer and it's scared the shit out of me.
01:34:29 So I, of course, show my little brother who is six at the time, this thing.
01:34:34 Shade legitimately cried for two hours.
01:34:39 And it haunted him for years.
01:34:41 Like in the way he describes it is that like up to that point,
01:34:46 he had not known what fear.
01:34:49 You thought of the meaning of fear.
01:34:51 Oh, my God, like he legitimately like gained the sensation of existential
01:34:56 dread from that because it gave him like a perpetual fear that at any time,
01:35:00 like the world could end or something like that.
01:35:02 OK, that like everything can be normal and then it can be horrible, you know?
01:35:06 And like, could he stomach like actually finding Waldo?
01:35:13 I have no idea.
01:35:14 But I don't know if you even remembered that it was a wear wears Waldo thing.
01:35:18 Amazing, the screamer.
01:35:19 But he, a few years later, he became like really afraid of the apocalypse.
01:35:24 Like any time we would like like people would talk about the end of the world
01:35:27 or anything like he would get really freaked out that the world was going to end.
01:35:31 And yeah. Hey, I've got a question from the Twitter here that I think is
01:35:35 wait, Thomas, not answering. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, please.
01:35:38 Yeah, I remember when I was a little kid, I watched a lot of sci-fi channel
01:35:42 and I watched all the alien abduction things and all the like crazy fucking
01:35:46 conspiracy theories about like aliens living among us or like Area 51 and shit.
01:35:51 So I was always terrified of that.
01:35:53 I thought I didn't get abducted by aliens and like get like some like fucking thing
01:35:57 because I already have a really weird phobia of like like bodies and organs and shit.
01:36:01 So like the fact that like I get abducted, like opened up and like they implant
01:36:05 something in the face of my skull. Yeah, that was fucking terrifying to me.
01:36:09 So even to this day, whenever I watch that alien shit, I'm totally fucking into it.
01:36:12 But at the same time, just like, oh, God, the government's watching me.
01:36:15 There's a spaceship outside my house. Yeah, that's aliens.
01:36:20 Yes, that's a good thing to be afraid of.
01:36:23 OK, here we go. Also, Simpsons Treehouse of Horror really grossed me out.
01:36:27 And I hate gore because of that. Anyone specifically, they do love gore
01:36:31 on their Treehouse of Horror. They really do. They really do.
01:36:33 And it's specifically like the sound design of the gore.
01:36:37 Just really like I hate horror movies because of the Simpsons.
01:36:40 Fascinating.
01:36:42 Well, OK, here's a question from at Lord Saiba.
01:36:44 By the way, this is on the Twitter.
01:36:45 Hashtag use ask PCP, send the questions out.
01:36:49 OK, so it's if you were sent back to high school current age,
01:36:53 would you be a Chad or a Virgin?
01:36:56 How will your experience go?
01:36:57 Think realistically.
01:37:00 I'd be currently absolute, absolutely a Chad.
01:37:03 Like, well, OK, am I actually 26 in high school because I don't think
01:37:07 anyone's going to want to fuck the weird 26 year old?
01:37:09 Let's assume that it's your current like mentality put in your body.
01:37:12 OK, yeah, because as as a woke adult, you understand that
01:37:20 like when I was in high school, the reason I couldn't communicate with anybody
01:37:23 or get laid is that I just didn't know where anybody was coming from.
01:37:26 Like, I didn't understand what they were thinking or what anybody was doing
01:37:29 or like what like how to take control of a situation or anything like that.
01:37:34 Now, I feel like with high school girls, you could just walk up to them
01:37:37 and be like, hey, suck my cock.
01:37:40 And they'd be like, oh, OK, you know, like it's a little working up to it.
01:37:46 I don't know about that.
01:37:47 You may have been watching too many anime.
01:37:50 Just the way the way I've learned about how like people how people think,
01:37:54 especially young girls, like like 14 year old girls are literally
01:38:00 all trying to get laid when they enter high school.
01:38:02 Like they go in. Well, OK, all right, they go into high school.
01:38:06 Like if I don't get laid, I won't be cool.
01:38:09 You know, like, OK, OK, who's did I have to be cool?
01:38:14 You know, yeah, but but like as a guy who has no social
01:38:19 like you are socially anxious, you're not just going to ask some girl
01:38:22 to have sex with you, whereas a girl can absolutely do that
01:38:25 and a guy is going to have sex with them. Well, of course, of course.
01:38:28 So so if I was if I was that guy, you know, like now I just have to have
01:38:33 the confidence to realize that the girls also want to fuck me, you know,
01:38:37 like I think that's what I didn't understand in high school.
01:38:39 Like I thought I want to fuck them.
01:38:41 They don't want to fuck me.
01:38:43 And now I realize no, they do.
01:38:44 There are there.
01:38:46 Sorry, there are so many.
01:38:47 There are so many like looking back on it, like obvious girls
01:38:51 who were interested in me and I never did anything about it.
01:38:53 Like because I just didn't I didn't understand that that's what was going on.
01:38:57 And now I do. And I'm like, oh, you motherfucker, you could have had it all.
01:39:01 There are only two things that a man needs to get laid.
01:39:04 And this is true at any age.
01:39:07 One is just sometimes you can just use one of the two.
01:39:10 One is just like the confidence to just go up and, you know,
01:39:13 just just put your balls on the table and say, here they are, sweetheart.
01:39:17 Pick them up.
01:39:18 So there's that, as Bill Burwood put it.
01:39:19 And then the other thing is something to back it up as in like, let's say you're
01:39:24 like, yeah, like if you've got, you know, you're you're you're like the
01:39:29 the fucking marching band can mean a lot of different things.
01:39:32 Well, that's true.
01:39:32 That kind of ties into a bunch of this stuff.
01:39:34 Like, you know, like really disgusting, fat slobs can get late.
01:39:38 Harry Weinstein, I was the kind of the way I looked in high school is one
01:39:43 of those like, change the outfit and you've got a good looking guy.
01:39:47 Sure. Sure. But it wasn't.
01:39:49 But instead, it was a guy with uncombed hair that goes down to his
01:39:54 knees and like shit facial hair and like wearing three different outfits
01:39:59 that don't like parts of three different so much of this is incredibly simple.
01:40:02 Like, yeah, literally get decent clothes, get a haircut and just like, don't be
01:40:06 gross. If I had cut my hair, shaved my beard, dressed in layers and spoke to a woman.
01:40:12 I would have gotten late in high school, but I didn't do any of that.
01:40:14 I didn't know better.
01:40:15 It's not that complicated.
01:40:16 But but social pressures are real.
01:40:17 I don't want to just say that I would immediately be a Chad.
01:40:20 Like there's unique pressures in in high school and how to make this work.
01:40:23 Your current mindset, though.
01:40:25 I mean, I have no doubt you like literally just transplant your brain
01:40:29 into the brain of a high schooler.
01:40:32 Like, I'm sure you can get.
01:40:33 I think anybody could.
01:40:35 Yeah, I really don't have much 20 could easily get late in high school.
01:40:39 It's just a matter of keeping your focus, you know, being willing to play
01:40:41 the long game when necessary and then just be be cool, be cool.
01:40:45 I mean, I'm I'm sure that if I had my brain and I went back,
01:40:50 I could have like actually made friends, which is like the first step.
01:40:55 I think you're right, because I didn't have really.
01:40:57 I didn't really have like a group of friends that were my group.
01:41:00 I just hung out with other people's groups of friends and just stood around them.
01:41:04 So like and it was always because, oh, I'm I'm worried that they won't like me.
01:41:08 So I won't do anything.
01:41:09 But obviously now I'm much more, you know, prone to just doing things and taking risks.
01:41:16 So I would be definitely able to make friends and be maybe the most popular guy
01:41:19 because I was like I even back then I was kind of good at guitar.
01:41:23 If I had capitalized on that, I could have been the guitar dude.
01:41:25 We had some guitar dudes who were very well respected in my grade.
01:41:29 Sam and Matt.
01:41:30 So Davoo points out, also, don't be in an exclusively religious social environment.
01:41:35 That usually helps you.
01:41:36 You're not wrong.
01:41:37 But but if you can cut under that, if you can be like the rebel,
01:41:40 like, oh, baby, I'm going to fuck you while God watches, you know?
01:41:43 I mean, you can maybe make that work.
01:41:46 Jesus Christ, it's like me.
01:41:49 I know Davoo, it's a big negative song.
01:41:51 I feel like I could probably have the social skills of this point
01:41:54 to be a Chad in that situation.
01:41:56 But I probably choose choose not to because if if we're going back
01:41:59 to our high schools, because, A, every one of my high school,
01:42:01 I wouldn't want to fuck anyways, because they're all horrible people.
01:42:04 B, I would have to lose all my weight again, and that would take a long time.
01:42:08 And you're in you're not.
01:42:09 It's not literally you have to lose the weight anyway.
01:42:11 It's your brain in your high school, self's body.
01:42:14 Let's put it that way.
01:42:15 Sure, sure.
01:42:16 I mean, I don't know if you're like a real.
01:42:18 All right.
01:42:18 Did you mean that you were fat in high school and you've lost weight since then?
01:42:21 Oh, yeah, I'm fat in high school, significantly fatter than I am right now.
01:42:26 So I have to work on that.
01:42:27 But then also, I'd probably to be too busy trying to invest in Google.
01:42:31 And then I could be fucking rich.
01:42:34 How the fuck you get invested age 16?
01:42:37 I could find a way.
01:42:38 I have I have a 28 year old brain.
01:42:40 So I could figure something out.
01:42:42 You put you put your piggy bank in an empty type.
01:42:46 I'll be like, dad, by Google, by Google.
01:42:49 I know it's a weird word, but trust me, do it.
01:42:51 Yeah.
01:42:52 Mail to Steve Jobs.
01:42:55 Wait, wrong guy.
01:42:56 OK, whatever.
01:42:57 All right.
01:42:57 Well, that's a good bunch of questions.
01:43:00 I think everybody I think we're good to wrap this one up to top that one.
01:43:04 So we might as well.
01:43:05 It's true. It's true.
01:43:07 If we're currently I am a drunk and that's because the next episode we're
01:43:13 going to do is a bonus episode, right?
01:43:16 We're recording it immediately after this.
01:43:17 I think it'll actually come out before this episode, though.
01:43:19 It will. That's right.
01:43:20 So if you want to hear the aftermath of me drinking throughout this entire
01:43:24 PCP and then getting shitfaced right afterwards, go become a patron for five
01:43:30 dollars, you get the bonus episodes that we record once a month that are always
01:43:34 goofy, hilarious, weird shit.
01:43:37 The next one's alcohol or the one that's already out.
01:43:40 The newest one is alcohol.
01:43:41 We're going to be talking about alcohol and getting shit.
01:43:43 And there'll be eight of them by the time you hear this out.
01:43:45 Eight episodes.
01:43:46 Yes, you can listen to all eight.
01:43:48 So you can literally pledge five dollars, watch all eight and
01:43:53 the value gets better every month.
01:43:54 Don't give them ideas.
01:43:55 You've mongoloid.
01:43:57 They won't because they watch all eight and they realize that they want.
01:44:00 They want to be able to access the future ones.
01:44:01 Exactly. Exactly.
01:44:03 That's how they know.
01:44:04 And no one's got that.
01:44:04 No one's got the kind of like weird patience that they're going to like
01:44:08 pledge once every six months or so and like get someone to do it despite us now.
01:44:14 We're counting.
01:44:14 Don't forget, we're also on iTunes and Google Play music.
01:44:17 So if you want to listen on your mobile device, sans YouTube.
01:44:21 The only the only people who the only people who would do that like like pledge
01:44:26 once every six months to get the episodes are the people who would not have pledged
01:44:30 until they just found out they could do that, you know.
01:44:33 Yeah, yeah, you're right.
01:44:34 Like there's some people who we might get because they just found out
01:44:37 that there's like a scheme they can do and now they'll actually pledge.
01:44:40 So we're still getting people we wouldn't have.
01:44:42 It's true. It's a net gain for us either way.
01:44:44 And of course, we've got a little bit of merch.
01:44:46 If you go to our red bubble page or our print all over me page,
01:44:49 there's links in the description.
01:44:50 Click on those and buy some dank PCP mugs and shit.
01:44:53 They're dope.
01:44:53 You know, we need to we need to run like our ads in the middle of the episode.
01:44:57 You're not wrong.
01:44:57 That's what I've been watching other big podcasts and they do that.
01:45:01 They do it like right in the middle.
01:45:02 We should do it like before the Q&A or something.
01:45:04 That'd be a pretty logical time on the hour.
01:45:06 It's usually a good place to.
01:45:08 Yeah, OK.
01:45:10 Also, is there anything else?
01:45:11 Twitter, we already talked to at TP Crasidators.
01:45:14 Subscribe to our Twitter and pledged to the fucking Patreon.
01:45:17 Subscribe to this channel for new shit because there's a lot of stuff
01:45:19 that doesn't even get on the Patreon.
01:45:20 Just videos uploaded here.
01:45:21 Like the current intense spat going on between Tom Oliver and Ben Sane
01:45:26 over why D&D is good or shit.
01:45:28 Who knows how that side will say Ben Ben's argument did not impress me.
01:45:33 I respect his opinion, but he literally just said everything.
01:45:35 I dismissed in my the first 10 minutes of my video.
01:45:38 Oh shit, Ben, you hear that?
01:45:39 You've been called it as a fucking hack fraud.
01:45:42 You're an embarrassment.
01:45:43 All right, everybody, that's it.
01:45:44 Thanks for listening and we'll be back next week or sooner.
01:45:47 No, wait, bonus episode.
01:45:48 Yeah, OK, give us money.
01:45:50 Thank you, everybody.
01:45:50 All right, we're leaving.
01:45:52 Goodbye.
