00:00:00 The Pro Crastinators Podcast
00:00:28 So when Rick and Morty season 2 was first starting, episodes 1 and 2 had been leaked months beforehand.
00:00:39 And the night that episode 1 actually debuted on Adult Swim, the staff had this big party, which I guess is probably a pretty normal thing to do on the debut of your video, but what was unique about this one was that they live streamed it.
00:00:56 They did a whole thing where they had the two creators, Dan Harmon and Justin Boyland, up on a stage, drunk as shit with this interviewer guy, and they were bringing up different people who worked on the show and talking to them for a little bit.
00:01:13 I mean everyone, it's clear that this was primarily just a party that was happening anyways, and they just decided to impromptu do this live stream thing. They just kind of dragged people up for a couple minutes, talked to them, and they'd go back to the party.
00:01:26 With the exception of Dan and Justin who were just up there fucking wasted talking about stuff.
00:01:34 And this was one of the most eye-opening things I've ever watched as a fan. It was deeply fascinating because of the things they were saying about their staff members.
00:01:49 You see, they had completed making the season before it ever went to air, because that's how American cartoons are made, very different from anime which is down to the wire with each episode.
00:02:00 But they were talking about how a lot of their best guys had been poached by Disney, and there's nothing they could really do to stop them.
00:02:12 They brought up their guy who was one of the main showrunners for the season, or assistant directors, or something like that.
00:02:22 And they were both like, yeah, this guy is great. He's been bought up by Disney because Rick and Morty is such a good show that everybody on it is being eyeballed by other people in the industry.
00:02:38 But Rick and Morty itself is a relatively low budget show on Adult Swim. They can't pay these people what they could be getting paid on higher level productions.
00:02:53 And they were like, yeah, he's got a family, and of course he's going to take the job at Disney. They're going to pay him twice what we are, and Dan and Justin are doing this show because they want the creative freedom of being able to work on whatever they get afforded by Adult Swim, which means working for less money.
00:03:14 So of course this guy is going to go to Disney, but they were like, yeah, if season 3 sucks, it's because we lost him.
00:03:22 And I was just like, whoa.
00:03:25 And they were explaining that the reason that season 2 of Rick and Morty took so long to come out, because it was like a year and a half between when season 1 had come out and there was a huge gap.
00:03:36 They had announced season 2 like way ahead of time, and it took forever, and it's taken forever now for season 3.
00:03:41 I mean, we're a year and a half from season 2, and there's still no season 3 yet, even though it was announced after like episode 1 of season 2.
00:03:48 They'd already been greenlit for the next season, which was kind of a shame because by the time episode 1 of season 2 came out, they'd already had a bunch of their guys bought up because there was no guarantee that they were getting a season 3 of Rick and Morty.
00:04:01 And then by the time they had that guarantee, some of their best staff were already gone.
00:04:05 This is the inner workings of the industry.
00:04:08 But they said the reason it took so long to get season 2 is that Justin Roiland is just so talented and so integral to the show that they can't duplicate him.
00:04:21 They can't find someone who's able to bring as much as he is to the show, so it's just that it takes so long to...
00:04:30 Because he voice acts half the fucking characters, he plays the two main characters, he plays a bunch of the other minor characters.
00:04:36 He writes most of the show, he directs most of the show, he's deeply involved at every stage of production.
00:04:45 He does the character designs, I believe.
00:04:47 He fucking basically does everything on the show, and there's just nobody who can fill in the gaps in his workload, and that's why it takes so long for Rick and Morty season 2.
00:05:02 And that blew my mind, and they were saying this guy who was getting bought up was the closest thing they had to someone who could fill in the gaps in Justin Roiland, and now he's gone and they're fucked.
00:05:14 This is basically the way they were putting it.
00:05:16 And I was like, whoa.
00:05:18 And now, I totally relate to that.
00:05:23 Because, and I know this is going to sound conceited, like I'm saying I'm some kind of massive talent or something.
00:05:29 But like, there's a lot of times where I'm like, man, my life would be so much easier if there was just another me to cover some of this ground.
00:05:38 Because a lot of what I make, it's not about me making it, it's about me wanting it to exist.
00:05:45 A lot of the anime videos I do, I would be fine if someone else made them.
00:05:49 If someone else, you know, made a video where they watched every Akiyuki Shinbo show and talked about every technique he used.
00:05:57 I would never have had to do that video.
00:05:59 I would just be like, oh, you did it, cool.
00:06:01 And, you know, I've said this about a number of YouTube videos where I've said, like, now that that guy did it, I don't have to.
00:06:08 You know, people will ask my opinions on shows sometimes and I'll be like, this dude already did it.
00:06:12 So, like recently, someone said, are you ever going to do a video on Berserk?
00:06:16 And I'm like, super eyepatch wolves video on Berserk said everything I would have said about Berserk.
00:06:21 I mean, maybe I could do a video about, like, just the scene where Guts kills 100 guys and just flaunt over how much I like that scene.
00:06:31 But even that, I couldn't fill a whole video, probably.
00:06:34 So, yeah, it's like, it's already out there.
00:06:36 But the problem is that there's so many things that I want to exist and that, like, I can't rely on anyone else to make because nobody else has the time.
00:06:46 Like, who else has time to watch every Shinbo show and write about it, you know?
00:06:51 Who else?
00:06:52 Because no one else is making money doing this, like the way I am.
00:06:56 You know, I feel like I'm the only person doing, like, super in-depth anime analysis and getting paid to do it.
00:07:03 Most of the people doing YouTube videos are not putting out videos frequently enough to make any money.
00:07:07 Like, you know, best guy ever, he has a Patreon and it could become a career one day,
00:07:14 but he puts out videos so infrequently that he doesn't get paid enough for his videos, you know?
00:07:19 And he's not even doing, like, really research driven stuff.
00:07:23 It's more just, like, here's why this thing is amazing.
00:07:27 But, like, yeah, nobody else, I mean, maybe Yuyukau.
00:07:32 I don't know how much money he makes or anything, but, like, yeah, like, there's not a lot of people who could, who would have the time and resources to do what I do.
00:07:41 And there's just so many ideas I have and, like, it can be painful sometimes to, like, realize the sheer enormity of how much stuff falls on me
00:07:52 because there's no one else to do it.
00:07:56 And that really is what I connect to with the whole Justin Roiland thing.
00:08:03 Yeah, there's no way to say it without sounding conceited, but, again, it's not about the quality of what I'm doing.
00:08:10 It's just about wanting those, like, I'm not saying that the world needs a shinbo video, but, like, it's something I want to exist.
00:08:18 And there's too many things I want to do.
00:08:21 That's really the point that I'm getting at.
00:08:30 So Casey Neistat just happened to end his vlog mere days after I, uh, had released the previous, um, decompression chamber in which I talked about how his videos had kind of gotten stale
00:08:45 and how he was probably going to end the vlog soon, and then sure enough, it happened.
00:08:51 I mean, I got a bunch of messages about it, people like, it's your fault, what did you do?
00:08:56 But honestly, it was pretty obvious it was going to happen.
00:08:59 Um, he joked about it.
00:09:02 I mean, he'd said he was going to do it a number of times.
00:09:05 The vlog was not going to live forever.
00:09:07 He had a video jokingly, like, clickbaiting saying that, like, called the end of the vlog, where he was really, like, talking about the end of that vlog, that that was something special.
00:09:18 Um, or something like that, or maybe it was the end of the vlog for a day or some shit.
00:09:24 But I mean, he'd been taking more breaks from it, he'd been saying that he was trying to get more challenges, and honestly, what said to me that the vlog was going to end soon
00:09:33 was this whole thing where he was going to make this, um, he was going to edit this video he shot in Vietnam with his son.
00:09:39 And he kept saying, like, you know, I might put the vlog on hold for a couple of days or something, or like, I might do this and that, I have to edit this video.
00:09:46 And then, like, for the next few vlogs, he kept saying, like, you know, well, um, I'm still working on the video, you know, it's just, uh, it's just taking a little longer.
00:09:54 And I was like, to me, this is a sign that the vlogs are in the way, you know, that he couldn't finish this video because
00:10:01 what little time he has to work on video is going towards the vlog.
00:10:05 So, I had a feeling it was ending soon, and that's why I kind of talked about it that way.
00:10:11 Um, and cause nice stat works the same way I do.
00:10:15 He's all about challenging himself and finding new ways to do things.
00:10:21 Um, for me, it's more a matter of getting bored and having too many ideas and wanting to do something different all the time, as well as being afraid of getting stale.
00:10:33 Um, whereas for him, it's more about the personal growth of, like, doing something that's harder than what you're currently doing.
00:10:40 Anyways, all of that aside, just wanted to address that since it was funny.
00:10:50 Back when I started this podcast, a few people had said that they accidentally misread the title as Digi Bro's Depression Chamber.
00:10:58 Well, that's what today's episode's gonna be.
00:11:01 I'm not depressed right now, but, um, I'm going to go ahead and tell the whole story of when I was depressed.
00:11:11 Like, just everything that happened at the time, for a few reasons.
00:11:16 Um, mostly because I haven't told the story extensively before, and I'm always wanting to tell stories.
00:11:25 It's just that this one is maybe somewhat uncomfortable, you know, if not for me, then for the audience.
00:11:32 Uh, and also because, but I mean, that's all the more reason to do it.
00:11:38 And, um, on, like, the last, it must have been the last Decompression Podcast, or maybe some other video before it,
00:11:45 I was, like, talking about, um, like, part of my experience of being depressed,
00:11:50 and DeVu said, like, when I was talking about it there, it sounded much scarier than it had ever sounded before.
00:11:57 Like, he'd heard me talk about having been depressed, but never really, like, in-depth or anything.
00:12:02 And I was like, huh, that's interesting that that's, you know, because he's listened to everything I've done,
00:12:07 so if he hasn't really heard how scary it could be, then it means I haven't talked about it enough.
00:12:12 And I'm also, I'm 25 years old now, and, you know, every year that goes on, this, these stories of my teenage years become harder and harder to tell.
00:12:22 And it's funny because for me, I regard all of this as, like, really uninteresting.
00:12:28 Even though if someone else was telling the same story, I'd find it interesting,
00:12:32 but for me, there's, like, this weird disconnect where, like, I think of myself as the guy who's, who's been making videos for the last three years, you know?
00:12:41 And, like, anything before that feels like a different person to me.
00:12:45 But that's not at all the case, like, so much of how I act now, and so much of all of this was informed by, you know, how I was in my teenage years.
00:12:55 And so I think, I feel like this story has to be told before it's too late, you know, before I can't remember it in enough detail.
00:13:05 And maybe the fact that I have forgotten details will help to streamline this story to be consumable in podcast form.
00:13:13 I thought about making this its own podcast on After Dark, but, like, because I don't want to do this in video form, it would be too weird.
00:13:22 I have an easier time talking about things I'm less comfortable with if there's no video, because I don't want to have to see myself saying it, or, like, you know, worry about where I'm going to cut audio and stuff like that.
00:13:35 Not as in cut for content, but, like, just edit out silences, because I have to think about what I'm going to say, because I can, like, remember everything.
00:13:46 And I don't really have anything else to talk about this week. I've been playing Pokemon nonstop for two days.
00:13:53 I will probably continue to play Pokemon nonstop for more days until the end of the period where this podcast would be slated to come out.
00:14:01 So anyways, this is just going to be a depression story.
00:14:06 And if that sounds like it'll make you sad, then don't listen to it.
00:14:11 Like, for me personally, when other people talk about depressing shit, it usually, like, doesn't...
00:14:18 I guess back when I was a teenager I did find that kind of stuff comforting.
00:14:22 Like, I did enjoy listening to other people talk about, like, their problems and their depression, because it made me feel like, you know, like I could relate to it.
00:14:30 Nowadays, I just get sad, because I'm not sad normally.
00:14:38 But anyways, yeah.
00:14:41 So, we'll start from when I was a little kid.
00:14:45 And I think as a kid, I don't think I could have been, like, what you would consider, because to me, depression is, like, a long-term feeling of unease and displeasure with your life.
00:14:58 It's where, like, for a huge amount of time, you feel like things aren't going your way and you just want to fucking die.
00:15:08 That's how I think of depression.
00:15:11 And some people have, like, in and out of it. They'll be like, you know, oh, I felt really depressed for, like, a week, and then I was back to normal.
00:15:19 And I guess I still have times like that where I can get depressed for, like, a day or two.
00:15:25 And I guess you'd still call that being depressed in a more general sense.
00:15:30 But I'm talking about depression more in, like, a clinical sense.
00:15:33 Like, seven straight years of feeling like dog shit and wanting to die.
00:15:39 You know, like, that's my experience with depression.
00:15:42 And so, as a kid, like, it's hard to think of it as depression, because when you're a kid, you kind of just flip emotions constantly.
00:15:52 Like, you know, it's just however you feel in that moment is how you feel.
00:15:55 There's less of this, like, broader personal context, I feel like.
00:15:59 Like, when I think back to me being a little kid, there would be days where I felt absolutely terrible.
00:16:06 But then I'd wake up the next day and I wouldn't even remember the fact that I felt bad the day before.
00:16:11 You know, I'd just wake up the next day and whatever happens happens.
00:16:14 There was no sense of continuity between emotions.
00:16:19 So there was a lot of stuff that would make me upset as a kid, because growing up, my family moved constantly.
00:16:27 And I looked weird.
00:16:31 You know, I had big ol' glasses and I looked like a girl.
00:16:35 I had long hair and I was extremely effeminate.
00:16:37 Anybody who's seen that video on After Dark where I said proof that I was a lolly shota.
00:16:42 Yeah, I look like a fucking girl.
00:16:44 Like, there's no two ways about it.
00:16:48 I didn't understand that at the time.
00:16:50 Like, I was just mad that other people thought that.
00:16:53 But I didn't, like, actually think of myself as looking like a girl until, like, later.
00:17:00 So, you know, when I was young, I never made any friends.
00:17:05 Like, it wasn't so much that I got picked on until, like, a bit later.
00:17:09 Like, when I was, like, a little kid, it's just nobody would talk to me.
00:17:13 And I didn't understand how to talk to people because I never talked to anybody.
00:17:17 We'd moved fucking constantly.
00:17:19 I never made any friends, you know?
00:17:21 Like, I remember, I'm sure I went to more than one kindergarten.
00:17:26 I'm sure I went to more than one first grade.
00:17:30 I did stay in the same second grade the whole year I was there.
00:17:34 The first time my parents ever, like, settled down for more than a year in a place was in this cul-de-sac.
00:17:43 We moved into when I was in the first grade.
00:17:45 And me and my friends were sort of the outcasts among the cul-de-sac.
00:17:50 You know, Ed, Ed, and Nettie, we were Ed, Ed, and Nettie.
00:17:54 And everyone else fit the archetypes the same way that the characters in that show do.
00:17:59 Like, that show was like the story of my life when I was a kid.
00:18:02 It was super relatable to me.
00:18:05 With the only exception being that in Ed and Nettie, particularly for Eddie,
00:18:13 you feel like he kind of deserves what's coming to him and the other two wouldn't really be as hated
00:18:18 if not for the fact that they hang out with Eddie.
00:18:21 I kind of saw as it's just victims, you know, when I was a kid.
00:18:25 Like, I just didn't understand why anybody, like, it was so hard to communicate with people, you know?
00:18:31 And I mean, we knew all the kids in the cul-de-sac.
00:18:33 We hung out with them, you know, I hung out with all these people,
00:18:36 but I never felt like they liked me or understood me or, like, wanted to be friends with me with a couple of exceptions.
00:18:44 Just a couple of kids who were my friends.
00:18:47 And so I made a couple of close friends in second grade.
00:18:50 But then what really started me, like, feeling depression, like, understanding it, to some extent,
00:18:57 was when I was in third grade because I got put into this advanced placement school.
00:19:01 It's like a whole, it's called School for Gifted Children, ODC, no, that's the university, ODC.
00:19:10 And it was a, it was just like a separate school for smarter kids.
00:19:16 But it was this huge long bus ride away.
00:19:18 And, like, so at this point, even though, you know, my family up to this point is we move all the time.
00:19:24 I lose contact with everybody I ever knew every time we moved.
00:19:28 This time, I just changed schools, but that still means I'm not seeing any of my friends.
00:19:33 Like, the friends who live around me who I went to school with are suddenly not around me, you know?
00:19:39 And so, uh, so yeah, I went to this, this gifted school.
00:19:44 And first of all, I shouldn't have, because even though I was, like, really excelling,
00:19:49 like, in the second grade, I was making, like, straight A's, you know?
00:19:52 So they all thought, well, this kid's like a genius, you know?
00:19:54 But then at this other school, it was, like, constant pressure to do, like, mountains of work.
00:20:00 You know, it was, it's not that you necessarily have to be smarter to do the work,
00:20:05 it's that they give you more work.
00:20:07 And I was not up for more work.
00:20:09 And so, my grades started falling a little bit.
00:20:12 And this is the kind of school where, like, if you're making C's or below, you're going back to normal school.
00:20:17 You know, like, it's not, it's not about just passing.
00:20:20 It's like you have to be excelling, because that's the point of this, of this school.
00:20:24 And I was not excelling.
00:20:26 And, you know, my mom was pretty harsh about grades.
00:20:30 Like, she was always, like, guilt-tripping me and stuff about the fact that I wasn't, you know, making good enough grades.
00:20:36 She'd sit, sometimes she'd be like, you know, sit in the kitchen and don't leave until you do your homework.
00:20:41 And I just would, like, sit there and just, like, stare at it and not do it.
00:20:46 And I'd just sit there for, like, hours and just stare at my homework.
00:20:50 And, um...
00:20:52 Yeah, so I felt bad about the fact that I wasn't doing great in school.
00:20:55 And then I was also getting more picked on, because this was at a time when Pokémon had come and gone as a big fad.
00:21:02 It's, like, 98 or so...
00:21:04 No, 90? Hmm.
00:21:06 If I'm in third grade, then it's either 99 or 2000.
00:21:09 Pokémon is kind of waned as a fad.
00:21:12 And I'm still wearing Pokémon shirts and stuff to school, because I care about it.
00:21:16 You know, I've always been someone who cares very deeply about whatever I'm into.
00:21:20 And people would make fun of me for wearing Pokémon shirts.
00:21:23 They'd make fun of me for having long hair. They'd make fun of me for wearing glasses.
00:21:27 You know, it never, like, escalated into full-on bullying.
00:21:32 Like, the worst that would ever happen to me is that, like, someone might take my jacket and, like, pass it back and forth amongst a couple of kids, you know,
00:21:39 and I'd be, like, trying to get it back. And that only happened once or twice.
00:21:43 So, like, there wasn't a lot of physical bullying.
00:21:45 It was mostly just people making fun of me, mostly for looking like a girl and liking Pokémon and, you know, all that good stuff.
00:21:52 And I didn't know any of these kids. I didn't know how to talk to them.
00:21:55 I didn't know how to clear up the issue.
00:21:57 So I didn't make a lot of friends.
00:22:01 And I remember that there was one day...
00:22:04 I probably had gotten, like, a report card with a C on it or something.
00:22:08 Or it was either that or I'd been made fun of that day in class, but I was just so fed up.
00:22:13 And I went up, and this story is hilarious and depressing at the same time.
00:22:18 If you listen to a lot of my stuff, you've heard me tell it before, that I went up to my brother's shades room,
00:22:23 and there was this line, like, basically a string of clothespins that went all the way up the wall that had beanie babies.
00:22:32 Like, it's like a type of clothespin that's, like, made to hold beanie babies.
00:22:37 And there's, like, this huge display of beanie babies my mom had set up in my brother's shades room.
00:22:41 Shade was, like, probably three, no, two or three at the time.
00:22:46 So I go into shades room and I'm, like, crying.
00:22:50 Then I sit down and I'm, like, I'm gonna kill myself.
00:22:54 So I take a clothespin and I put one clothespin over my nose and one clothespin over my lips
00:23:00 with the hope that I can suffocate myself.
00:23:04 This obviously will not work.
00:23:08 Not even so much because I started gasping for air,
00:23:12 but because the clothespins hurt to have on my face.
00:23:16 And I've never been able to tolerate pain,
00:23:20 which is good, because that's what's kept me from self-harm over all these years,
00:23:26 is my incredibly low threshold for pain.
00:23:30 Someone there?
00:23:34 Thought I heard somebody.
00:23:38 Thought I heard somebody.
00:23:42 So, but, you know, even if that was
00:23:46 a hilariously unsuccessful attempt,
00:23:50 I would still catalog that as a suicide attempt.
00:23:54 Because people who
00:23:58 have a history of attempting to commit suicide are far more likely
00:24:02 to commit suicide. Like, if you've thought about it, if you've tried to do it,
00:24:06 there's a chance that you're gonna keep trying to do it, or keep thinking
00:24:10 about it, you know?
00:24:14 And so that was kind of, I mean, I didn't know that at the time, but that's always been kind of a specter
00:24:18 hanging over me when I've been suicidal. It's like, you know, I kind of fit the
00:24:22 profile of someone who would do it.
00:24:26 But again, I can't really think of that as depression, because
00:24:30 I'm sure the next day after that, I woke up
00:24:34 and went about my day, and it was probably not that bad,
00:24:38 you know? Like, I think me being upset and sad back then
00:24:42 was more reactive. It's like I had a bad day, and therefore I
00:24:46 felt depressed. There was less of that hanging bloom.
00:24:50 And then when I started fourth grade at that school, that was just utterly miserable
00:24:54 because our teacher was like a way overblown hard ass.
00:24:58 From what I understand, she was fired shortly after the
00:25:02 year, because I left. Like halfway through fourth grade, I left that gifted
00:25:06 school because I just couldn't keep up. It was too much. And I was
00:25:10 like the third person in the class to leave, and there were like three more people who left
00:25:14 after me. And then that teacher, I heard she got
00:25:18 a hand. Just from like sheer amount of complaints
00:25:22 she was getting about what she does. Don't know how
00:25:26 that works. I don't know why she didn't have tenure or something, but I don't know.
00:25:30 So I go back to normal
00:25:34 school. And now again, I'm in fourth grade, but I don't know anybody.
00:25:38 I'm back to the school I was at before, but I don't know anybody. Everything's
00:25:42 progressed past me. I don't know all these people and what they're up to. I'm still getting
00:25:46 fun of, because now there's like the skater culture
00:25:50 thing, like Tony Hawk's pro skater, Bam Margera era starting to come
00:25:54 in, and there's all these skater kids who are like the cool kids, and I'm
00:25:58 still sitting here with fucking Pokemon. And everyone's like
00:26:02 what the fuck is, what's up with you? Because I never understood trends.
00:26:06 I never understood, I never
00:26:10 observe people. I'm not someone who understands what other
00:26:14 people are thinking easily or like tries to
00:26:18 look out for what everyone else is doing. I was always just doing what I
00:26:22 wanted to do, and I didn't understand why that was a
00:26:26 bad thing. I never understood what I was supposed to be doing.
00:26:30 And then finally, so
00:26:34 fifth grade rolls around, I was in a class with some of my friends again.
00:26:38 Eventually we finally move. We moved to Florida. That fucking
00:26:42 blue ass. But I don't think I was depressed.
00:26:46 And that's where I started doing creative things more.
00:26:50 Moved a few more times. I went through middle school.
00:26:54 But it wasn't really until I was 14, and it was sort of
00:26:58 in between middle school and high school that the depression
00:27:02 really began. And it was because
00:27:06 not only at school did I not really have any friends
00:27:10 and I wasn't really doing anything. But I was starting to become a teenager.
00:27:14 So I was starting to become more hormonal and starting to
00:27:18 understand the world around me a little bit more in a bad way.
00:27:22 Suddenly it's come into full focus that I'm the
00:27:26 weirdo. I think growing up
00:27:30 up until that point I had always thought everyone else is weird for thinking
00:27:34 that I look like a girl or that I act this or that way. Then
00:27:38 suddenly I realized, no, I'm the weirdo. I'm the one nobody understands.
00:27:42 I'm the one who's the freak here.
00:27:46 That suddenly became very apparent to me in the 8th grade.
00:27:50 It was like, oh, I'm the odd man out. I'm the one who doesn't know
00:27:54 what's going on. And that
00:27:58 kind of hit me hard. And I just like
00:28:02 I never made real friends. I would just kind of
00:28:06 hang out with kids who I could joke around with and
00:28:10 at the lunch table. But none of them really liked me. There was a couple kids I would hang out with
00:28:14 at my house. But even then I never felt like we were close.
00:28:18 It's just like someone to do things with. That's kind of what friends were to me.
00:28:22 Someone who had enough of the same interests that you could sit in the same place
00:28:26 and do the same thing together. But then you don't really care about them outside
00:28:30 of that. The only person I ever had who was a real close friend
00:28:34 was my cousin Boyd. He was four years older than me.
00:28:38 And me and him got into anime together. And we like really
00:28:42 hung out all the time when I was in like the 6th and 7th grade.
00:28:46 But then he moved away to Pennsylvania and I didn't see him for like
00:28:50 a few years. So during the period where I then got depressed.
00:28:54 So like, yeah, I didn't have any real good connections. And
00:28:58 my parents started fighting. And there was like a...
00:29:02 Not so much like violent fighting as just, there was like a lot of
00:29:06 it looked like they were going to split up. Like it looked like my parents were going
00:29:10 to divorce. You know, things were getting
00:29:14 like, heck, there was a point where like a brief period where
00:29:18 my dad just like stayed in a hotel for a few days.
00:29:22 You know, like to not be in the same house kind of thing.
00:29:26 So that was like really traumatic. Cause me and my brothers
00:29:30 all thought like, this is it. It's going to, they're going to fucking split up.
00:29:34 You know, and my parents up through this point, you know, they used
00:29:38 to, they used to, my parents don't fight anymore. Like these days they're just
00:29:42 like a fucking docile old couple essentially.
00:29:46 They used to fight. And we'd always be like
00:29:50 this is it. It's finally happening, you know.
00:29:54 So yeah, I was 14. I was the weird kid
00:29:58 in school. My parents seemed like they were going to split up. And this is really where
00:30:02 it just, this is where I would begin like chapter depression,
00:30:06 you know. And I got really,
00:30:10 I was really into online communities at the time. And I spent a lot of time
00:30:14 on these message boards. And I know there was, there was
00:30:18 some poster who will say it was female
00:30:22 for the sake of the story. I have no idea for real.
00:30:26 But I was like in love with this person. So
00:30:30 I was always on these message boards and like, you know, trying to seek out
00:30:34 relationships online. Like I was starting to become aware of the idea of
00:30:38 relationships online and friendships online. But even online I was a fucking
00:30:42 weirdo. Like no one understood me. And I always, I had a very
00:30:46 crass sense of humor, a very confrontational attitude. I
00:30:50 cared way too much about the things that I like and was like ready to fucking
00:30:54 write tooth and nail about anything I liked. You know, you're wrong
00:30:58 for disagreeing with me kind of attitude. I mean, if you think I come
00:31:02 off that way in my videos now, you have no fucking idea how toned down it is.
00:31:06 Like I was a, I was a fucking brat in my teens online.
00:31:10 And you know, most of the people on internet message boards are older.
00:31:14 They're in their later teens or their early 20s. That's like the main age range of people
00:31:18 on message boards. And those people were not having it, you know,
00:31:22 because I was a fucking bratty kid and I don't blame anyone for that.
00:31:26 But you know, that's why I was even online. I felt like an outcast
00:31:30 and I was depressed. So where
00:31:34 it all really spiraled down was my dad
00:31:38 who had been working in the car business for a long time. And he was
00:31:42 my dad's an amazingly hard worker. He had, I mean,
00:31:46 my parents both came from really like pretty much nothing.
00:31:50 You know, my dad in high school had to like steal to
00:31:54 eat and stuff. Like he was deathly skinny. He joined the Navy
00:31:58 when he was 18, dropped out of high school, joined the Navy and like just so he could
00:32:02 eat essentially. He said like, you know, they would give me free food if I joined. So that's why I joined.
00:32:06 And my mom had run away from home at like 16.
00:32:10 So they're both from, you know, like really low class
00:32:14 sort of environment. And my, like they had worked just normal
00:32:18 kind of jobs, but they're both really hard workers and they both would always, you know,
00:32:22 get to management positions quick and stuff like that. And
00:32:26 my dad joined the car business and
00:32:30 was immediately the best salesman like every month. He would always win
00:32:34 salesman of the month. You know, he'd always move up the ranks through the car industry.
00:32:38 So he'd been fairly successful at that. So we've been living, you know, the
00:32:42 middle class suburban life for a long time. Well
00:32:46 my dad was going through all this like spiritual shit. He was becoming like
00:32:50 a Christian and constantly reading spiritual texts
00:32:54 and stuff and just generally felt that the car business
00:32:58 was not in line with his like current, you know, state of mind and
00:33:02 lifestyle. And my parents were trying to make up after all this fighting
00:33:06 they've been doing and we were like, let's move again. And we moved into downtown
00:33:10 Richmond and we moved into this old ass house. It was like a
00:33:14 house built in like the early
00:33:18 1900s or something like that. And it was
00:33:22 huge and it was really cool, but it was like kind of, you know,
00:33:26 falling apart. But because it was so old and so falling apart,
00:33:30 it was really dirt cheap. So we got to get a huge house for dirt cheap. And my dad
00:33:34 became an apprentice electrician. So his wage,
00:33:38 you know, plummeted from what it used to be.
00:33:42 And we lived in this house from like September
00:33:46 through February, I want to say. 2004 to
00:33:50 2005.
00:33:54 No, 2005 to 2006. From September to February.
00:33:58 Something like that. It was six months that we lived there.
00:34:02 And those six months were grueling.
00:34:06 That was by far the worst period of my life. And I've often
00:34:10 said of that period that I think I might have legitimately gone insane.
00:34:14 Like I was losing my fucking mind. Because we moved into this
00:34:18 big old house and we were in the middle of
00:34:22 like the ghetto. We were in the ghetto
00:34:26 in like downtown Richmond. Me, Victor and Shade, we all,
00:34:30 I was in high school. Victor was in middle school. Shade was in elementary school. We went to
00:34:34 like all black schools. Like there was no white
00:34:38 kids there at all. Like maybe, I would see like five or six white kids in the whole
00:34:42 school. Mostly black and Latino and stuff.
00:34:46 And it was really hard to make any friends that way.
00:34:50 Because I mean, I've been an outsider among white people. You know, the school
00:34:54 I was going to before that was all white people. And I still felt like an outsider.
00:34:58 Now I'm the only fucking white kid and
00:35:02 I'm a fucking weird white kid. You know, so I was not able to
00:35:06 make any friends at this school. No one would talk to me. No one
00:35:10 wanted anything to do with me. I totally just looked like an outsider to their culture
00:35:14 and everything. It was like this kid knows nothing about what's going on
00:35:18 here, you know. So I felt totally
00:35:22 alone at this school. And
00:35:26 I had, you know, at this point I had
00:35:30 super long hair and I was growing in like this shitty ragged facial hair.
00:35:34 Kids would always call me Joe Dirt and
00:35:38 I started wearing sweatpants all the time. No fashion
00:35:42 sense. I looked like total shit, you know, and nobody wanted to talk to me.
00:35:46 This is at the period where I'm starting to like, you know, really like
00:35:50 want a girlfriend and stuff like that. That's not happening,
00:35:54 obviously. And at home
00:35:58 I just felt like I couldn't talk to anybody. Like no one else
00:36:02 understood what I was going through, you know. My parents have always been hard to
00:36:06 talk to about anything emotional because they just don't seem to get it
00:36:10 or they don't get where you're coming from. Like their mindset is kind of like
00:36:14 how could you possibly not be happy when you've got so much,
00:36:18 you know. Not that that would have been the case at this time, but like
00:36:22 I didn't see a lot. Jesus Christ, the fucking wind is like
00:36:26 rattling my house. I didn't see my family as much
00:36:30 as I had before, you know. And Victor just
00:36:34 kind of holed up in his room and played a lot of GameCube and
00:36:38 part of it was that like in the previous
00:36:42 house I'd been really into video games. Like I'd gotten
00:36:46 huge into gaming and like particularly
00:36:50 RPGs. And I'd buy tons and tons of RPGs with all the allowance money
00:36:54 I could get. So like probably 20 to 25 dollars a week I'd get. And I'd
00:36:58 go out and buy all these used games at GameStop.
00:37:02 So I had a decently sizable collection of PS2 RPGs that I had recently
00:37:06 accrued. Then my PS2 broke. Like right when we moved.
00:37:10 So gaming out the window. Cause all the new
00:37:14 games I had or was excited about were all PS2 games. Now I don't have a
00:37:18 PS2 and we can't afford to buy a new one. You know, the GameCube was still there
00:37:22 which we had had all these games from like 2001 till then.
00:37:26 But Victor had that and so I just wasn't playing a lot of games
00:37:30 and I didn't have any money to buy anything. There was no passion which I could
00:37:34 support here. Now I remember that it took a month
00:37:38 for the internet to get hooked up in this house. Like we moved
00:37:42 in and it was a whole month without internet so I couldn't go onto these message boards
00:37:46 where I'd been like living. I couldn't
00:37:50 do anything really. I had my
00:37:54 own computer but it didn't have internet access. So all I used it for was like
00:37:58 writing poems and listening to whatever music I had on there.
00:38:02 And that month just kind of broke me. It's like I had no one to
00:38:06 talk to. No one online. No one at school. Like
00:38:10 if I hadn't had Victor and Shade around I probably would have just utterly
00:38:14 lost it. Like if there had been literally no one to ever talk to I don't
00:38:18 I think I would have fucking gone completely insane. But I would just like lay around
00:38:22 and cry essentially. I would just lay on my bed
00:38:26 despondent for days.
00:38:30 This is where I started keeping a knife under my mattress
00:38:34 just in case the day finally came that I could kill myself.
00:38:38 I'd be ready.
00:38:42 And again I was super guarded about all of it. I wouldn't talk to anybody about the
00:38:46 idea that I was feeling bad. Anyone I was in front of they didn't get to know about
00:38:50 this. The internet finally did
00:38:54 get hooked up in this house. So I was on the message boards again. But the internet
00:38:58 was like the most painfully slow. Like you click
00:39:02 on something and it takes like up to five minutes to load a page.
00:39:06 So I'm on message boards like
00:39:10 refreshing the page and then like waiting five minutes for it to refresh and then
00:39:14 refreshing again until someone says something and then I immediately reply
00:39:18 you know and then wait all day to see if the response will come.
00:39:22 That was my life. Sitting on a message board waiting for people to
00:39:26 say something so that I can respond and then waiting more.
00:39:30 And then loading the page and loading the page and
00:39:34 if I remember correctly
00:39:38 I guess I had taken the speakers from my mom's
00:39:42 computer because she wasn't really using them and I had those in my room because my computer had a bunch of music
00:39:46 on it. Obviously music streaming was not a thing yet but I had
00:39:50 a bunch of music downloaded to my computer from my cousin having put it there
00:39:54 or ripped CDs I'd put on there. So
00:39:58 the only internet, the only computer that had internet was in my mom's office and so I would sit
00:40:02 in her office in silence all day reloading this fucking page
00:40:06 waiting for anything. I started
00:40:10 questioning my sexuality a lot. I definitely
00:40:14 thought I was bisexual for a while. For a little while I thought I might be gay.
00:40:18 I had like a very brief internet relationship
00:40:22 with a guy which turned out super weird and I bailed on.
00:40:26 And anytime I was always trying to seek out you know internet relationships. Basically
00:40:30 anyone who would pay enough attention to me to talk to me I would try to
00:40:34 establish a relationship with. And there was a couple people who did who in retrospect
00:40:38 I realized were like utterly broken people.
00:40:42 People with way way way worse you know stuff
00:40:46 going on than I have. So
00:40:50 you know I mean I guess I was pretty broken at the time too. So like it was me
00:40:54 like trying to enter like little relationships with other horribly
00:40:58 broken people. And then it would always get weird for me at some point
00:41:02 like when it started to feel real that's when it would feel weird to me
00:41:06 and I would break it off in the most like ass whole way
00:41:10 possible. Like I'd always say something like you know
00:41:14 you know I just I was just using you
00:41:18 for my own fucking gain or something and like you know I actually
00:41:22 don't care about you or anyone and I'm just I hate the world. You know like that's the kind
00:41:26 of I would just totally break off communication with people
00:41:30 and do it in the most dick hole way that I could think of.
00:41:34 So
00:41:38 I lived in that house for six months and I think everybody was pretty fucking depressed and upset.
00:41:42 I don't think anybody liked being there. My dad finally
00:41:46 took back up he got back into the car business
00:41:50 because I mean this had been the second time that he had left the car business only for
00:41:54 everything to go to shit because when we moved to Florida a few years prior that was the same
00:41:58 story. He'd left the car business we went to live with my aunt
00:42:02 for like three months. Then like it was such a nightmare that
00:42:06 they like fully paid our trip back home to rehire my dad
00:42:10 at a higher position because they wanted him so badly
00:42:14 and it just was like utter misery but again I wasn't really depressed yet at the time.
00:42:18 This is more like outright depression. So finally
00:42:22 we moved back to Virginia Beach which is the city I live in now. I've lived here a lot
00:42:26 like a lot of those houses were in Virginia Beach
00:42:30 so we moved to Virginia Beach and like a little house
00:42:34 I started going to this high school in the ninth grade where I ended up going
00:42:38 for the rest of high school.
00:42:42 But at this point again
00:42:46 like you know I'm a new kid again
00:42:50 still not making any friends still kind of like just a weird
00:42:54 guy. Now I'm depressed now I don't know what the fuck to do
00:42:58 with myself. So
00:43:02 I started collecting music but no one
00:43:06 to talk to about it. No one understood my fucking
00:43:10 taste in music. No one understood what I was going through and it just
00:43:14 fucking sucked and I was miserable all the time and I hated living
00:43:18 the end.
00:43:22 Eventually as high school went on
00:43:26 I started making friends slowly but surely
00:43:30 I started accruing a little stable of friends who would come over
00:43:34 all the time and hang out and you know that made things a little better.
00:43:38 And then really like for a little while what had kind of saved me
00:43:42 was getting back into anime because you know I'd been really into anime
00:43:46 in 2003 and then I kind of you know got into other stuff
00:43:50 video games and music and then in 07 at like the very beginning of the year
00:43:54 I got into anime in a much bigger way thanks to the megatocchio forums
00:43:58 and that's when I started my blog and like
00:44:02 watching anime and blogging made me really happy like that was the one
00:44:06 thing I had going on that made me super duper happy and
00:44:10 made it like way easier to deal with life. But I was still
00:44:14 constantly bouncing between like utter terror
00:44:18 especially because this was now at the time where you know I'm in high school and everyone's talking about
00:44:22 what are you gonna do in your future and like for me it was
00:44:26 always the debate of am I going to take school seriously and go all out
00:44:30 or am I going to leave because I sort of looked at it as an all
00:44:34 or nothing it's like either you're going to stick around in school and really
00:44:38 excel and make great grades and you know and go to a good college
00:44:42 or because if you don't if you don't go to a good college is no point
00:44:46 so you might as well just drop out and go do whatever the fuck you want.
00:44:50 And this was like you know I was a God
00:44:54 finishing up 10th grade and I was about to go into 11th when all
00:44:58 this is happening when I'm getting into anime and all that again
00:45:02 still kind of depressed and then like
00:45:06 I was just like constantly bouncing between like being paranoid
00:45:10 or just stressed out or not wanting to talk to people or just not feeling
00:45:14 comfortable in my own body you know.
00:45:18 I got really interested in like all kinds of like
00:45:22 BTQ stuff like I was super obsessed with that in my late teens like
00:45:26 just I guess I identified with that sense of like
00:45:30 not being sure if you are who you're supposed to be
00:45:34 you know like for a while
00:45:38 I thought that like maybe I'm
00:45:42 supposed to be a woman you know but I never like took it very far
00:45:46 in the way that people do now I think because the culture embraces it so much
00:45:50 that there's places like Tumblr where people are like you know you can
00:45:54 easily meet people who are doing stuff like that that it's so much more of like a thing
00:45:58 people like jump headlong into in their teens whereas for me
00:46:02 it was kind of like an interesting question that like every once
00:46:06 in a blue moon I'd hear something about
00:46:10 you know about like gender fluidity or something like that
00:46:14 and well I guess that term probably didn't even exist yet just people changing
00:46:18 genders and stuff and I was like whoa and I'd be like super fascinated with it
00:46:22 became super obsessed with Yuri
00:46:26 and lesbians and like that was all I cared about for a long time
00:46:30 was Yuri and
00:46:34 then like
00:46:38 so I remember over that summer I watched Minabi
00:46:42 Straight and utterly broke down because at the end of that show
00:46:46 it's about like the main characters graduate high school and they all sort of go their separate ways
00:46:50 and you see them all like one girl goes to America to continue her studies
00:46:54 one like goes into sports they go into
00:46:58 all this different stuff and Minabi herself she just
00:47:02 becomes a freeder as they call it where she just goes
00:47:06 between different part-time jobs and like doesn't stay to one place and everyone was kind of like shocked
00:47:10 by it but she was like yeah you know like she's free-spirited she'll be happy
00:47:14 wherever she goes and that just like totally broke me
00:47:18 because I was like fuck you know and I was trying to like
00:47:22 do the academic route like I was setting myself up that I was gonna do like advanced placement
00:47:26 English and I was gonna go to like our school had this program called ATC
00:47:30 where you go to like a technical school and like a
00:47:34 they bust you back and forth to learn more technical stuff and I was gonna try to do that
00:47:38 you know I was like ready to try to do this fast track thing and then I watch Minabi
00:47:42 and I see her like yeah you know I can be happy wherever I go and I was just like
00:47:46 like utterly mind broken like trying to
00:47:50 decide you know am I going to become a school guy or
00:47:54 am I gonna like like look at Minabi she could have fucking done anything
00:47:58 and been happy about it why can't I just go do anything
00:48:02 you know I became really obsessed with the idea of becoming a film director
00:48:06 and so 11th grade started
00:48:10 and I sort of got fucked
00:48:14 in regard because basically there was a miscommunication between
00:48:18 me and my guidance counselor and I ended up not being able to go to
00:48:22 ATC I did get the advanced placement English class but that's the only
00:48:26 advanced thing I had so I was no longer on this like you know like
00:48:30 excellent track to success and the technical courses that would have given
00:48:34 me the kind of knowledge that would have like allowed me to fucking do
00:48:38 things you know totally out the window
00:48:42 advanced placement English fucking sucked I hated my teacher I hated the whole style of
00:48:46 the class you know I love literary analysis
00:48:50 obviously it's what I do you know and at the time
00:48:54 I was like I was always happy to write analytically it's that the teacher
00:48:58 wanted you to read everything a certain way you know she was she
00:49:02 she had her idea of what the story means and you had to kind of bring
00:49:06 that out it was fucking horrible
00:49:10 I hated it and it was way too much work and so I became
00:49:14 the most depressed ever and you know I'd met my
00:49:18 friend Don Son and like we bonded over mutual
00:49:22 love of welcome to the NHK because that for me was the most relatable thing in the world
00:49:26 and I remember I would just sit in my room like paranoid
00:49:30 and not leave and I just talked to him about how
00:49:34 paranoid I was you know and he was also he was a hikikomori like a full blown one
00:49:38 like not even leaving his room for like years
00:49:42 because he had a he had a condition that kept him out of school so he would just like be
00:49:46 in his room all day every day and not leave and we kind of bonded over that
00:49:50 but you know that's that's where I was going and there was like
00:49:54 times where I would get so paranoid about my grades because my grades were slipping
00:49:58 and I didn't want my parents to know so like I'd get like a report card or a
00:50:02 progress report and I'd just like lock myself in my room all day
00:50:06 and like I would be I was I never actually did
00:50:10 reach this point because I'm squeamish about doing so
00:50:14 but like I would take bottles and be like I'm gonna piss in this bottle instead of going downstairs
00:50:18 to use the bathroom because I don't want my parents to see me you know
00:50:22 never ended up doing that I just hold it all day I'd like I would hold in peeing
00:50:26 for hours like waiting till I thought everyone might be
00:50:30 asleep or that no one would hear me come down the stairs and ask about my progress report
00:50:34 you know like I was so fucking paranoid
00:50:38 and just yeah I didn't want to see anybody I didn't want to talk to anybody
00:50:42 I just wanted to hold up in my room and watch anime and write my blog and post about
00:50:46 shit you know and I mean you can read a lot of a lot of my writing from this
00:50:50 era is on my blog and a lot of it's just like well there's a lot of posts
00:50:54 I set to private because they were just like a like nonsense of nothing to do
00:50:58 with the blog but like a lot of it would just be me telling stories about
00:51:02 how fucking sad I am you know I wrote about Manabi
00:51:06 straight in my reaction to it years back and I wrote about
00:51:10 Evangelion and how that was like a huge connector for me
00:51:14 when I was 14 when I first got depressed
00:51:18 like someone had loaned me the show and I watched all of it like just before my
00:51:22 15th birthday that blew my fucking mind because I related to Shinji so perfectly
00:51:26 everything about him was exactly how I felt
00:51:30 but so yeah
00:51:34 you know I'm just wandering through this life of being depressed and fucking
00:51:38 like it was never worse than 11th grade like that early part of 11th grade
00:51:42 when I was in advanced English and stuff and like just being overwhelmed by work and stress
00:51:46 I just I wanted to kill myself
00:51:50 badly and like I would have these
00:51:54 nights where I just lay in bed thinking about
00:51:58 like how I'm either going to run away the next day like I'd extensively plan out
00:52:02 how am I gonna run away where am I gonna go how am I gonna live off the land
00:52:06 you know and just like escape from life
00:52:10 or how am I gonna kill myself how can I do it
00:52:14 where it won't hurt or where like how can I get the materials how can I
00:52:18 you know but then I worry about like what are my parents you know how's it gonna affect them
00:52:22 like I don't want to devastate my mom you know like my mom
00:52:26 would fucking not be able to handle one of her kids killing themselves she would have
00:52:30 completely broke like she would have she would have lost
00:52:34 her mind if one of us killed ourselves because she cares way too much
00:52:38 about us you know um so yeah like
00:52:42 that that was a huge like factor preventing me
00:52:46 but then I would just think well what if I just hurt myself like if I hurt myself
00:52:50 sadly enough people have to notice because that's the thing I wanted someone
00:52:54 to notice I wanted someone to notice that I was freaking out that I was
00:52:58 depressed and stressed out but I wouldn't tell anybody
00:53:02 you know I didn't have the courage to talk about it
00:53:06 but I just wanted someone to figure it out and like in my mind I thought
00:53:10 don't I look horrible don't I look depressed like I'm scowling
00:53:14 all the time aren't I don't I look sad but then any time I look at myself in the
00:53:18 mirror I'd realize I didn't look that way I just look normal like I don't
00:53:22 have an emotive face I don't really show what I'm thinking
00:53:26 I have an amazing poker face if you will
00:53:30 you know I would literally think that I looked depressed and then see
00:53:34 myself in the mirror and realize I looked normal and I'm like this is why nobody's noticing
00:53:38 this is why nobody's noticing the cry for help that's only on the inside
00:53:42 you know the few times I had to deal with anything with my parents
00:53:46 I would write them notes because I was you know I was confident in my writing
00:53:50 so I would just like write out these like multi-page notes and leave them on the table
00:53:54 before school like where I was like way more honest about what I was
00:53:58 thinking or what I was trying to do um there was one where I was like
00:54:02 I want to drop out of school here's my plan you know I wrote out this whole thing
00:54:06 and my parents were just like what the fuck are you talking about you know uh no
00:54:10 so you know throughout 11th grade
00:54:14 I determined I was going to drop out I was going to drop out and become a film director
00:54:18 I was just going to start making movies um
00:54:22 yeah and I was really that was like where my head was at
00:54:26 and at this time I reconnected with my cousin Boyd and eventually
00:54:30 like around the time I was finishing up 11th grade and going into 12th
00:54:34 he moved in with me like into my room um
00:54:38 so I would say that that that gave me less like I had less
00:54:42 sit around and be paranoid and like fucking you know losing my mind
00:54:46 and going crazy so uh I guess that helped
00:54:50 though I still was you know largely depressed and we never got
00:54:54 anything off the ground with regards to film um you know
00:54:58 I was trying to I was trying to make movies that never worked I tried to write stories
00:55:02 I have like just the other day I was going through all my notebooks of all the story concepts
00:55:06 I had there's fucking like dozens and dozens of them
00:55:10 there's so many story ideas I tried to get off the ground that never amounted to anything
00:55:14 you know because for 10 years I thought I was going to be writing fiction
00:55:18 or uh or you know producing some kind of some kind of fictional
00:55:22 stories so I have tons and tons of stories that just never came to be anything
00:55:26 um I you know I was working on the
00:55:30 blog all along just because it made me happy I never thought there'd be a future in it
00:55:34 I never thought that was something that would take off and like
00:55:38 there was a period where I thought well maybe I can do this professionally by writing for
00:55:42 a website um there was one time I submitted a review
00:55:46 to anime news network and they tore me to shreds
00:55:50 uh because of the fact that I like spoke in first person and that it was
00:55:54 like it was more personal than objective which I guess they tried to go for
00:55:58 so-called objective reviews um so I got rejected hard
00:56:02 uh not that I think that review was actually good but
00:56:06 you know um so for a long time I was kind of under the impression
00:56:10 like I'll never be able to get work for a website
00:56:14 because the way I write is too out there like I write about myself
00:56:18 I write gonzo style posts and that's like I don't want to change
00:56:22 that like it wouldn't be fun anymore if I just wrote like articles
00:56:26 you know that that's not my style then it would just be a job
00:56:30 um
00:56:34 I was 16 where I had this like sort of
00:56:38 phrase I came up with because I've never believed in any
00:56:42 kind of higher power I've never believed that there's really meaning to human life in the
00:56:46 universe I've always had that sort of nihilistic outlook
00:56:50 I've never believed that there's anything more
00:56:54 to life than personal
00:56:58 personal happiness you know making your own life good
00:57:02 is world good but it's always going to be in small parts and like really part of
00:57:06 making the world good is making your own life good you know
00:57:10 um global happiness comes when everybody's happy and if you're not happy then
00:57:14 you're dragging down the global happiness you know
00:57:18 so to me making myself happy was the most important thing
00:57:22 and I had determined when I was 16 that like if I'm not
00:57:26 happy there's no reason to be alive like what could possibly
00:57:30 make it worth it like like if there's no greater
00:57:34 cosmic purpose to my existence then why even be alive
00:57:38 if I'm not happy I just that was like the the great question
00:57:42 at the heart of it and so to me every second that I wasn't happy with
00:57:46 my life was just a countdown to suicide like you know
00:57:50 uh if the but the the thing that kept me going is that I've always been very
00:57:54 optimistic and very uh like yeah in spite of all
00:57:58 the depression and cynicism I've always been a hardcore optimist I always
00:58:02 think things are gonna go okay you know and like so
00:58:06 what kept me going is that like I always believed that I was gonna get
00:58:10 out of it I always believed like eventually this will all
00:58:14 end and I'll become like rich and famous you know because that's always been
00:58:18 my goal be rich and famous particularly rich uh
00:58:22 you know I want I want to have enough money that I can kind of do whatever
00:58:26 I want with it and I want to be doing what I love I want to
00:58:30 be rich and famous from doing what I love and I always believed that was
00:58:34 gonna happen I always thought eventually I'm gonna write the story that
00:58:38 that breaks I'm gonna make a movie that breaks you know
00:58:42 something's gonna give something's gonna happen and I'm gonna succeed
00:58:46 and I never stopped believing that which is why I wouldn't kill myself like
00:58:50 even when I desperately wanted to it was like but if I do then these ideas never
00:58:54 come out you know the success never comes if you if you give up
00:58:58 so just keep fucking bashing your head against the wall
00:59:02 until it breaks you know it's sort of always been my mentality
00:59:06 just why shows like girl in the gun resonate with me so much like it's about overcoming
00:59:10 what appears to be impossible no matter how long it takes
00:59:14 and how much effort so that's sort of what kept me
00:59:18 going and uh but yeah
00:59:22 again the cries for help like the worst
00:59:26 one I remember the scariest thing I did was
00:59:30 that like I wanted to somehow hurt or
00:59:34 or kill myself I didn't I just you know again I'm terrified of pain
00:59:38 and I just put my hand on my shoulder
00:59:42 like just like you know like grabbing like the back of my shoulder and I just
00:59:46 started scratching like just up and down scratching my back
00:59:50 and I probably had pretty long nails
00:59:54 and I just kept doing it for like 25 minutes
00:59:58 like just like thinking about how badly I hoped that eventually
01:00:02 I'd you know either bleed
01:00:06 or something or like it would cause something just anything anything that
01:00:10 would make this noticeable you know and I'm just scratching this back part of my shoulder
01:00:14 for like 20 minutes and then finally
01:00:18 look at my fingers and I see that there's all this
01:00:22 blood caked in under my nails and I freaked out
01:00:26 because that's the thing I want like even though
01:00:30 one part of me wants there to be pain the second I register that it's
01:00:34 there it's suddenly terrifying you know so I go running down
01:00:38 to the bathroom I look and I have all these fucking you know these four trails
01:00:42 of blood from where I've just scratched fucking all the skin off my shoulder
01:00:46 and I just freaked out and I didn't tell anybody I covered it you know it was
01:00:50 it was all within shirt range none of it was something that would show on my body
01:00:54 so you know my shoulder hurt for a day or so and then
01:00:58 it was gone but like it was fucking terrifying to think like
01:01:02 to realize like I've actually done something to myself I've actually
01:01:06 hurt myself you know
01:01:10 so yeah so that's kind of the general state of mind
01:01:14 for most of high school just
01:01:18 sitting around in my room hoping to die waiting for the day I get to die
01:01:22 you know or that something succeeds or that I break through
01:01:26 it had to be one or the other it's an all or nothing scenario either I
01:01:30 make something so good that the world loves me or
01:01:34 I fucking end it all in squalor
01:01:38 and
01:01:42 the decisions I made from then on from like high school
01:01:46 onwards were all about sort of prolonging the inevitable
01:01:50 because I really thought that if I got a normal
01:01:54 9-5 job and eventually gave up on
01:01:58 creativity that's when I'd die that's when it would finally kill me
01:02:02 if I was unable to live doing what made me happy then
01:02:06 that's what's finally gonna do me in so as high
01:02:10 school is ending my dad's like you have to either get a job or go to college
01:02:14 pick one and I pick college obviously and this is when I moved
01:02:18 like we moved into the house I live in now right when I was right after
01:02:22 I graduated high school and I've lived here for 7 years so
01:02:26 going on 8 so long time
01:02:30 this is the house I've lived in by far the longest finally stopped moving around
01:02:34 like when I was in you know when I was in high school we moved once but it was
01:02:38 the same high school zone as was this house
01:02:42 but I was out of high school by then so
01:02:46 so I start college I start going to community college and I was for whatever
01:02:50 reason for years I was terrified of driving my mom wanted to start
01:02:54 college too so me and my mom went together we both went to an art college
01:02:58 and you know she would drive me and we would go out
01:03:02 and you know spend most of the day there and come back and so yeah I went to college
01:03:06 with my mom hilariously enough
01:03:10 and you know it didn't make it nothing was any
01:03:14 better there like I felt more okay I like college way
01:03:18 more than school like high school fucking blows high school is the worst experience of my life
01:03:22 college is fine it's just like
01:03:26 I didn't want to do it you know that's the worst thing about it I don't think there's
01:03:30 anything wrong with it like I mean there's a lot wrong with it as an institution in
01:03:34 terms of the fact that it costs way too much fucking money and
01:03:38 it's way too inconsistent with how useful it actually is you know some professors
01:03:42 are worthless some are okay some classes will teach
01:03:46 you something and some classes will teach you absolutely nothing
01:03:50 and there's no difference in how much those cost you know so like
01:03:54 I don't advise college but in terms of like a place to go
01:03:58 and do a thing it's not so bad it's not like high school
01:04:02 it's just a miserable draining fucking nightmare of an experience
01:04:06 it's fine I just didn't care
01:04:10 I didn't want to do it and I had middling grades in all
01:04:14 my classes and I wasn't doing all that well now
01:04:18 as it went on like we did one semester
01:04:22 with me and my mom and then my dad
01:04:26 convinced me and my cousin boy who was still living in my room he convinced
01:04:30 us like that we should try to start studying business because my dad
01:04:34 has always kind of had this dream of opening a family business
01:04:38 but he only wanted to do it if we were all going to take it seriously
01:04:42 and he didn't think we would he was like you know you guys have not proven that you can actually work on
01:04:46 anything so he said if you guys could study business and learn
01:04:50 how to do it and like prove to me that you understand it then we could open up a
01:04:54 family business and we were like well that sounds promising business classes
01:04:58 you can take all of them online don't ever do this
01:05:02 never take all online classes unless you're really confident that you can
01:05:06 do all the work because I signed up for like
01:05:10 three or four business classes all online
01:05:14 um this is where everything broke down
01:05:18 this is where it finally broke me
01:05:22 because I have a guilt complex about not doing
01:05:26 well you know like I want my parents to think that all the money they've
01:05:30 poured into me and all the livelihood that I've stolen from them has not gone to waste
01:05:34 you know I want them to be proud of me and to think I'm doing well
01:05:38 but I didn't like school and I was not going to do it you know and
01:05:42 most of my days would consist of me sitting
01:05:46 around thinking about how badly I need to do this schoolwork
01:05:50 and I wouldn't do anything else because you know
01:05:54 there's something else and that's distracting you from the schoolwork
01:05:58 but I didn't want to do the schoolwork so I would just sit around depressed
01:06:02 and hate myself and hate my life and hate everything I'd gotten myself into
01:06:06 and um there was a brief period where I tried to
01:06:10 turn my business studying into anime blogging
01:06:14 if you go through my blog you can find posts I wrote about both
01:06:18 Gorilla Gonnett's Serial Experiments Lane where I took chapters of the textbook
01:06:22 and like applied them to anime in order to
01:06:26 make it interesting for myself because I had realized while reading the textbook
01:06:30 that anime blogging and textbooks were actually fairly similar like you're
01:06:34 basically just describing facts about a thing
01:06:38 so like yeah I tried to do that didn't keep it up for very long
01:06:42 I probably wrote like two posts and then
01:06:46 there's like a deadline for when you can cancel
01:06:50 classes and I knew well ahead of this deadline
01:06:54 that I should cancel but I was too afraid to admit it
01:06:58 I didn't want to admit to my parents that
01:07:02 you know that I was going to drop out that I couldn't do it
01:07:06 that there was a waste of time and you know my parents kept asking me like every day
01:07:10 they'd ask like are you doing the work are you doing the online coursework and I'd always go
01:07:14 yeah like we'd be at dinner and just like mm-hmm yeah sure
01:07:18 I'm in the eye and say it I think they knew I was fucking lying
01:07:22 because why else would they ask all the time you know
01:07:26 I was just lying about it and then the day fucking passed
01:07:30 like the time passed and then I just felt
01:07:34 even worse because it's like well now I fucked them out of all the money
01:07:38 they could have got their money back before this date and because I'm too much of a fucking
01:07:42 coward to admit that I'm not doing the work now all that money's gone probably over
01:07:46 a thousand dollars is community college you know it's not it's not like I'm wasting
01:07:50 university dollars but which would have been absolutely
01:07:54 devastating but yeah I mean it was a waste of a huge
01:07:58 amount of money and I just I just wasn't doing it wasn't
01:08:02 doing the work and eventually I mean my mom
01:08:06 like your grades in these classes are on this online thing called
01:08:10 blackboard my mom has the password to my blackboard she can look at my grades
01:08:14 anytime she wants you know but I think my parents knew that I was
01:08:18 failing and they were trying to like get me to say it so it's one day
01:08:22 my mom starts asking me about my grades I'm like downstairs hanging out and she starts
01:08:26 asking and I'm just like avoiding the question she's like you know I
01:08:30 have your blackboard password and I just like retreat I just like ran I just
01:08:34 ran up to my room I closed the door I had a fucking panic
01:08:38 attack now if you've never had a panic attack it's
01:08:42 where your heart starts racing you start breathing heavily like
01:08:46 you're like you feel like you're like everything there's like lots of adrenaline
01:08:50 and feeling like you're gonna pass out at the same time like you it's just like your
01:08:54 heart and body are out of rhythm with one another I was just freaking the
01:08:58 fuck out you know and I'm just like it's over
01:09:02 she knows she knows she's definitely seen my grades I don't know what the fuck I'm thinking
01:09:06 I don't know what I'm trying to hide this was when I was like
01:09:10 I need help because
01:09:14 like I've there's this line and welcome to the NHK
01:09:18 that resonates with me so strongly it's in the anime
01:09:22 when Satou there's like this other guy who's a Hikikomori
01:09:26 who they meet later into the show and the guy says at one point like
01:09:30 you know all those shelves are lined they're in his room he's got all these bookshelves
01:09:34 all those shelves are lined with self-help books I've read them all I could probably
01:09:38 write one myself and none of it's helped and that
01:09:42 was that was how I felt at the time I'd read everything about
01:09:46 how to get yourself out of depression how to how to be a positive thinker
01:09:50 how to you know stop worrying and love the world
01:09:54 kind of thing like I'd read all this shit and I too felt I could write one
01:09:58 you know but it wasn't helping none of it was helping
01:10:02 none of it was actually getting me out of this situation none of my
01:10:06 personal effort none of the effort I'd put in over the last six years
01:10:10 because I'm 20 at this point you know six years
01:10:14 maybe I'm maybe I'm 19 I'm 19 at this point
01:10:18 so five years of trying to get out of
01:10:22 it and it just wasn't happening nothing was getting me out of it
01:10:26 nothing was working and I was like
01:10:30 this has got to be clinical like there's just no way there's no way I'm getting
01:10:34 out of this I've tried everything I could I've looked up you know my dad
01:10:38 has always been had the kind of attitude that like you can just get through things
01:10:42 you know that's that's why it was impossible for me to talk about this with my dad because he saw
01:10:46 it as a personal strike you know well you just got to work
01:10:50 hard and you know you just got to pick yourself up
01:10:54 and I'm like yeah I've tried that you know I can't work hard because I'm
01:10:58 fucking depressed because I don't want to work I don't want to do anything you know
01:11:02 there's no making myself want to do these things
01:11:06 I don't understand what you think I can do but that's not a thing I can do
01:11:10 so that's when I was like this must be fucking clinical
01:11:14 there's nothing I can do about this I've tried all that I can
01:11:18 and it's none of its work so let's seek help
01:11:22 so uh you know
01:11:26 I'm like I've looked into a lot of this shit online
01:11:30 I've been researching suicide this whole time and I'm constantly looking up stuff about suicide
01:11:34 stuff about depression you know I'm always trying to figure out what the fuck
01:11:38 is the issue or what I can do about it
01:11:42 so I found out that if you were to go to a hospital
01:11:46 and tell them I think I'm gonna kill myself then they'll like
01:11:50 they'll you know they'll put you in like a room and fucking look at you or whatever
01:11:54 uh and hold on to you until someone shows up to
01:11:58 and claim you or whatever so I was like alright
01:12:02 here's what I'm gonna do and this is what I did
01:12:06 I wrote out a letter to my parents because again I can only really communicate through writing
01:12:10 at like 2 in the morning because my dad wakes up
01:12:14 at 4.30 am 2 in the morning I uh
01:12:18 write this letter extensively explaining like I'm depressed I've failed
01:12:22 those classes you're not getting that money back you know I'm
01:12:26 I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life I'm never getting any better
01:12:30 I've tried everything I know this stuff inside and out and nothing's
01:12:34 gonna happen unless I fucking get help uh you know
01:12:38 I'm going to the hospital I've ridden my bike to the hospital
01:12:42 uh you know you can come find me and so
01:12:46 I caught on my bike in the like frigid fucking
01:12:50 February air I was wearing a t-shirt so I didn't
01:12:54 want to grab a jacket and then once I was out the door I didn't want to go back inside
01:12:58 so I'm fucking freezing uh writing my bike
01:13:02 down the fucking like like you know miles up the road
01:13:06 to the hospital and I show up
01:13:10 and I sit in the waiting room and it just so happens that the way the waiting
01:13:14 room is laid out and because it was so late no one could see me
01:13:18 no one ever noticed I was in the hospital I sat in there for probably
01:13:22 an hour and a half to two hours uh with
01:13:26 like CSI playing and I was just holding and I
01:13:30 I didn't have my own cell phone so I'd taken my mom's phone like I'd written the letter like
01:13:34 you know if you need to call me I have mom's phone um
01:13:38 so I had my mom's phone on me and I was just holding onto it sitting in the lobby
01:13:42 of this hospital for like hours no one noticed I was there
01:13:46 finally I get a call from my dad like are you still at the hospital and like
01:13:50 I'm you know shaky voice like yeah he's like you know have they
01:13:54 seen you yet I'm like no he's like just stay there we're gonna come get you so they
01:13:58 show up huge teary eyed fucking dramatic
01:14:02 spectacle we go back home they finally set me up with an appointment
01:14:06 with a psychologist so all the psychologists for a
01:14:10 while honestly like it's funny
01:14:14 because for me the value of a psychologist
01:14:18 was simply that I could talk to someone who actually understood what the
01:14:22 fuck I was talking about like I don't think I learned anything from him
01:14:26 I don't I don't think it was a process of like there was something I didn't know
01:14:30 about myself that had to be unearthed you know there was no
01:14:34 there was none of that and I also think he was you know
01:14:38 he was milking me this this dude everything everything about the place I was
01:14:42 at was kind of shady I think this dude kept me coming back for longer
01:14:46 than necessary because it was paying you know
01:14:50 and but like just the fact that I could talk to somebody
01:14:54 who actually knew where I was coming from who understood what depression is
01:14:58 who understood these hangups I had and where my anxiety was coming from
01:15:02 and why I felt that way that was enough to make it worth it to me
01:15:06 you know that nobody else I could talk to would understand any of that shit
01:15:10 and uh so I saw him for a while and then
01:15:14 he got me to go to the psychiatrist and the psychiatrist prescribed me
01:15:18 a medication called Wellbutrin now I do not recommend this
01:15:22 medicine to anybody because even though it did work for me lots
01:15:26 of people who've taken it have had utterly devastating effects
01:15:30 my brother Victor who turned out was also depressed
01:15:34 and he sort of came out about it around a year year and a half later
01:15:38 um he kind of went through the same thing he was depressed for a super long
01:15:42 time decided there was nothing he could do about it finally reached out
01:15:46 for help you know partly inspired because I had done it starts taking medications
01:15:50 Victor went through like four medications and every single one of them made him worse
01:15:54 and Wellbutrin was the one where he was the most
01:15:58 suicidal he'd ever been cried all day he he said
01:16:02 like the the the most heavy moment of his life is like he was sitting there
01:16:06 crying and listening to the song sleep forever by Portugal the man
01:16:10 and just thinking about suicide and my dad came in and saw him
01:16:14 crying and just came over and just like you know held him as he
01:16:18 wet that he was like that was the worst thing that's ever happened to me
01:16:22 um the worst I've ever felt in any case
01:16:26 and I yeah but for me I got
01:16:30 prescribed this medication uh by a guy who was like
01:16:34 obviously just pushing it like that dude the guy who actually prescribed me
01:16:38 didn't know shit about me didn't know the first fucking thing about me
01:16:42 and every time I'd walk in like for another appointment he would just write me up the
01:16:46 fucking thing and send me on my way you know he'd like ask how's it going
01:16:50 like how how's the medication treating you and I had a lot of concerns like
01:16:54 for instance that it had this horrifying side effect that made me fucking blink
01:16:58 constantly uh you know he'd just brush him off
01:17:02 he'd be like oh well you know you'll get used to it
01:17:06 and stuff you know eventually it'll all start making sense
01:17:10 that's the kind of attitude he had
01:17:14 so yeah I started taking this medication
01:17:18 and I went back to school I did
01:17:22 one English class and then I did another semester
01:17:26 of like um like general studies and shit
01:17:30 and maybe another semester after that but eventually
01:17:34 I was like at some point
01:17:38 I got I got a D in psychology which I had thought of as a passing
01:17:42 grade but then I found out that a D is too low for it to be a transferable credit
01:17:46 and I actually liked the class I liked psychology and that's when
01:17:50 I was like I can't do college there's no way I can do this if
01:17:54 I'm failing a class I like then this is not this is not for me
01:17:58 you know but what about butron did
01:18:02 um to me it was mostly an anxiety cure
01:18:06 not so much that it cured depression that it cured anxiety because my
01:18:10 biggest problem really was anxiety that I would get so hung up on like
01:18:14 you know not doing my homework or that something bad was going to happen
01:18:18 if I didn't do this or this or that I wasn't getting my life together like all those things made me anxious
01:18:22 but well butron allowed me was to stop giving a fuck
01:18:26 it was not that it allowed like made me work better you know it didn't
01:18:30 make me actually do my schoolwork it made me stop being anxious
01:18:34 about the fact that I wasn't doing my schoolwork so it didn't make me
01:18:38 any more successful or better of a person it just made me someone
01:18:42 who wasn't fucking anxious all the time you know who
01:18:46 like instead of going oh my god I'm not doing my homework
01:18:50 I can't watch anime but if but I also don't want to do my homework so I'm not going to do anything
01:18:54 I would like I would just go watch anime instead of doing my homework
01:18:58 so that's what it offered me
01:19:02 so I dropped out of college and then I spent like a straight year and a half doing
01:19:06 nothing you know
01:19:10 I got through the summer that summer I went out to
01:19:14 I went for a month to the Philippines and
01:19:18 to see my friend ghost lightning anime blogger extraordinaire
01:19:22 and hung out with him for a month and like the hope was that was going to instill something
01:19:26 that was going to become more worldly you know and I mean I feel like I did
01:19:30 but the results were not what my dad was hoping for you know I did not
01:19:34 come home and immediately get a job I came home and immediately
01:19:38 like interviewed for a job working for one of
01:19:42 the dealerships that for the BMW dealership that was under
01:19:46 my dad's company and they said they would hire me and I never
01:19:50 went back I just didn't want to do it I didn't want to work
01:19:54 and I spent a straight like then my mom that fall my mom got
01:19:58 cancer and so I spent a lot of time like being the guy who would
01:20:02 drive her to and from appointments and I kind of made that my excuse for not working
01:20:06 and then time just kept going on and I just kept not doing
01:20:10 anything you know I mean my parents were bugging me about it they were stressed about it
01:20:14 but you know they had their own shit to worry about I was just like
01:20:18 not doing anything then finally
01:20:22 it was when I found out about Egoraptor and John Tron
01:20:26 and when Game Grumps started and they talked about how it was actually their job
01:20:30 to make YouTube videos that like everything clicked and I was like I can do this
01:20:34 I can make YouTube videos like I have a clear well spoken voice
01:20:38 I understand like I write in this style already
01:20:42 I can make people care about this
01:20:46 and then I started the YouTube series Adventure Action
01:20:50 RPG on Modal Soul Productions which is video games analysis
01:20:54 that's what I thought I was going to be doing but the audio
01:20:58 was garbage and so I thought well I need a microphone so I went and got
01:21:02 a normal job at Target worked there for like four months
01:21:06 bought a bunch of equipment left the job became
01:21:10 my little pony analyst and achieved YouTube success
01:21:14 and I haven't really been depressed since then I would say I stopped like
01:21:18 again the well butrin really did cure my anxieties
01:21:22 which were the main source of my depression and so even though I was
01:21:26 still like upset with myself for the fact that I wasn't really doing anything and I was just living stagnantly
01:21:30 I was I never became that level of anxious and paranoid
01:21:34 again and I eventually stopped taking the medication like
01:21:38 I hated the side effects and
01:21:42 and I felt like well I'm already fucking I'm you know I'm not depressed anymore so fuck it
01:21:46 I stopped taking them and nothing you know I did not regress
01:21:50 I just stayed the same forever so I think whatever it
01:21:54 was I think I think there was just a point when I was 14
01:21:58 when we when when my parents were gonna split up and when
01:22:02 you know we were moving into the ghetto and I was going through hormonal changes
01:22:06 I think that I just like had I think
01:22:10 at some point there became a deficit in the amount
01:22:14 of like whatever you know chemical keeps you happy
01:22:18 there was a deficit in that and it never recovered
01:22:22 like like you know let's say it's producing at a constant rate and therefore
01:22:26 let's say it's like five right let's say you always have five
01:22:30 of this this item in your head and you know
01:22:34 every day you expend one and a new one comes up and then it feels like
01:22:38 I expended three all at once and so even though a new one kept
01:22:42 coming up it was never bringing me back up to five
01:22:46 and when I took the well butrin it brought me back up to
01:22:50 five and and I've stayed that way that's how it feels to me
01:22:54 like it was just a sudden dip and then a sudden
01:22:58 rise and I've been fine since you know again
01:23:02 not that I was like happy or anything I just wasn't depressed
01:23:06 and and then once I started my job and
01:23:10 became successful on YouTube now I've just been happy you know and I do have
01:23:14 times where I get depressed but it's much more in that conventional typical
01:23:18 every man yeah I felt depressed for a few days because
01:23:22 I wasn't happy with how things were going you know I haven't had a
01:23:26 major catastrophic I want to fucking kill myself every day
01:23:30 depression since then
01:23:34 and you know right now part of the reason I wanted to talk about this
01:23:38 is that my fucking friends are depressed
01:23:42 Ben's depressed because I don't know I don't want to get into his personal
01:23:46 stuff but he's depressed right now
01:23:50 Hippocrates seems pretty depressed Jesse's depressed because he's like
01:23:54 in heartache just everyone I know is depressed
01:23:58 and it sucks
01:24:02 because I hate when my friends are depressed because I want everyone to
01:24:06 be happy and I there's nothing I can do to change
01:24:10 that like there's nothing I can do to help them because they already know why
01:24:14 they're depressed and I can't make it not that way
01:24:18 and like you know the things that make me happy don't make everybody else happy
01:24:22 because for me it's all about like the feelings
01:24:26 of security and doing what I want to do
01:24:30 those are the two things that make me happy feeling secure and doing whatever I want
01:24:34 and both of those are facilitated by money like those are both basically
01:24:38 just straight up monetary things so to me making a lot of money
01:24:42 is happiness like they say money can't buy happiness I fully disagree
01:24:46 to me happiness has like a concrete dollar value
01:24:50 it's you know if I can make enough money by doing
01:24:54 what I want to do then I'm happy and enough money in
01:24:58 my definition is enough that I have
01:25:02 savings that if anything goes wrong I'll be ready you know that I have
01:25:06 money in savings so that if anything goes wrong
01:25:10 it won't bankrupt me having no debt
01:25:14 feeling like if I need to buy something I can just buy it
01:25:18 you know like I wanted a thousand dollar laptop I bought one
01:25:22 like because I wanted a laptop that wasn't gonna fucking fail on me like all my others
01:25:26 did and I bought that and it wasn't a financially
01:25:30 crippling thing to do so it was just something I could go do you know
01:25:34 that to me is like the most valuable thing
01:25:38 more so than the laptop itself the fact that I could buy it
01:25:42 is the most valuable thing to me that's the feeling of security
01:25:46 and if being able to do what I want and to be able to go out and eat everyday
01:25:50 and always eat stuff that I like you know and to be able to
01:25:54 you know just afford to have a decent lifestyle like that's
01:25:58 what happiness is for me and I feel that like you know
01:26:02 because all I really like to do is work and eat as I've said on this podcast before
01:26:06 the only thing I really want to do is to work I love making videos
01:26:10 I love doing shit and the only time that I feel stressed about it is when I feel like I'm not
01:26:14 getting out of the house enough and it's easy to go out and just
01:26:18 eat a few times a day and there I feel like I've gotten out of the house and let's get back to
01:26:22 work you know I've put out so far this month
01:26:26 as of this recording I have put out 20 videos that I was in
01:26:30 according to my playlist there's 20 videos have been released
01:26:34 that I was a part of that's not including at least
01:26:38 15 unreleased let's plays that I haven't edited yet
01:26:42 you know commentary I filmed with DeVue that I haven't edited yet
01:26:46 like a podcast
01:26:50 I recorded with Wave Motion Canon which may or may not be out by the time of this
01:26:54 recording I don't know when it actually releases
01:26:58 you know I've done it I do lots of work I'm always working and on top of that
01:27:02 I've watched a few complete shows I've played 24 hours of fucking
01:27:06 Pokemon Sun you know I've been
01:27:10 working out every couple of days with Ben
01:27:14 I've been going out to eat all the time I keep myself busy
01:27:18 and the only times I feel sad and upset with my life
01:27:22 is when I'm not busy when I don't have any ideas
01:27:26 for work or I'm not satisfied with any of my ideas that's the worst time
01:27:30 when it's like I don't actually want to do any of these ideas I have and there's nothing
01:27:34 else like right now I actually probably would be in
01:27:38 a little bit of a video creative rut if not for the fact that I'm playing
01:27:42 Pokemon you know like that's what's keeping me busy right now is that
01:27:46 Pokemon is clear and I love it and right before that
01:27:50 I was like you know watching all those Chris
01:27:54 videos and getting into like some of those ideas and like I'm always jumping
01:27:58 from inspiration to inspiration so that I never get bored because if I get bored I get sad
01:28:02 and I don't want to be sad so you know
01:28:06 yeah I guess that's where I'm at now and I hope you enjoyed this story I hope it wasn't
01:28:10 too depressing or that it was interesting I really don't know if it was interesting at all
01:28:14 like to me again this stuff is like almost about a different person
01:28:18 because that story you know
01:28:22 ended in 2010 like that's that's how
01:28:26 2011 I was 20 years old you know when
01:28:30 when I got the job at Target and finally kind of
01:28:34 that was in late 2012 and I kind of put a stop to it all you know like
01:28:38 well I mean I was depressed I was a little depressed when I worked at Target because I had to work but like
01:28:42 once I started the channel and everything kind of picked up from there I've never had
01:28:46 a huge the worst it's ever been is when I broke up with my girlfriend you know because
01:28:50 it was my first big breakup and we've been dating for six months and it was like a huge blow
01:28:54 but that's like the worst I've felt since then
01:28:58 so yeah hopefully that's
01:29:02 inspirational to some people if you're dealing with major depression to like
01:29:06 find some way and you know my brother Victor
01:29:10 who the medication didn't work for him he just kind of like accepted
01:29:14 the idea that he'd be depressed forever like that was how he got out
01:29:18 or not how he got out of it how he dealt with it was just to be like this is who I
01:29:22 am like just to self-identify as a depressed person and just live with it
01:29:26 but he's not depressed anymore because now he's in a really happy
01:29:30 relationship and that's like totally made him like a different guy
01:29:34 you know he's like happy all the time now used to be he was always angry
01:29:38 like every day that I talked to him he was angry for no reason
01:29:42 and now he's usually happy for no reason
01:29:46 so he's totally about faced just thanks to getting into a good
01:29:50 relationship so you know if you're depressed seek to change something
01:29:54 and if you can't change anything by yourself try to find somebody who can
01:29:58 and there's a lot of different ways to reach out I did it
01:30:02 through text usually you know writing a letter and just leaving it somewhere
01:30:06 because it's a lot easier than talking to someone you know if you can't
01:30:10 talk up to your parents and talk to them but you can at least write something
01:30:14 on a piece of paper and just leave it where you know they'll see it and then
01:30:18 like you know and then you're at school so you don't have to be there when they read it
01:30:22 that's another thing I was never around when they were going to read this stuff
01:30:26 then you know that's a great way to do it
01:30:30 so yeah enjoy your night or day
01:30:34 I'll talk to you next time
01:30:40 I'll see you next time
