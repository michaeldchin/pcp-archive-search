00:00:00 3, 2, 1, DROP!
00:00:20 You know what they say, a bitch on her knees is worth two in a hand basket in the black market.
00:00:27 Agreed.
00:00:28 Welcome to The Rowdyfuckers' live coverage.
00:00:33 You'll never meet a more hardcore set of jugglers and banksters and criminals.
00:00:42 Brought to you in the third dimension. We've just come from jugglers, Take Washington.
00:00:47 We were marching for our rights to exist and procreate as jugglers.
00:00:53 And to be members of the Dark Carnival.
00:00:55 With decriminalized jugglers, we're not a fucking gang we're an art form.
00:01:00 ICP does not produce no violence. It changes your fucking brain to make you a better person.
00:01:05 Basically, it's how I feel.
00:01:07 It's like those fat cats in Washington. They don't know about miracles.
00:01:10 They don't fucking get it.
00:01:11 They've never seen a miracle in their entire fucking life.
00:01:13 They've never listened to fucking Carnival, Carnage, or any of that shit.
00:01:17 All they fucking know is how to smoke cigars, use taxpayer money to emit greenhouse gases.
00:01:22 They don't know anything.
00:01:24 They're just shoveling government tax money into greenhouse gas into the furnace.
00:01:29 They don't know anything about fucking renewable energy.
00:01:32 They don't know anything about clown noises.
00:01:34 They don't know anything about getting fucking jiggied with Wii Sports, the greatest game ever fucking made.
00:01:39 They just don't know, but we're gonna show them.
00:01:41 President Donald J. Trump, this is for you.
00:01:45 This is gonna prove to you that jugglers are worthy of being a recognized citizen.
00:01:51 Think about what you're about to see, long and hard.
00:01:55 Get the fucking neurons fired.
00:01:57 We're going on Fox News.
00:01:59 We're going on Fox News.
00:02:00 Soon enough, you're gonna see this.
00:02:02 And if you see this on cable television, on Fox News, know that your fucking kids are not safe.
00:02:06 I don't know why I'm looking at it. Your kids are not safe.
00:02:08 We're gonna fight each other.
00:02:10 In both the online world and off.
00:02:14 Yeah, yeah. We're gonna battle.
00:02:16 We're gonna do battle here in the real world in my house.
00:02:19 Here in the ATL.
00:02:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:23 Here in Washington DC, just off the streets, we went to a random house and fucking here we are to protect our rights.
00:02:31 It was just like, I was just there in full clown makeup with a picket sign.
00:02:36 Like with just a picture of me in full clown makeup, in the crowd around me.
00:02:41 The picket sign was exactly identical to the scene before me.
00:02:45 And it really made a powerful statement to those bad cats in Washington.
00:02:48 They don't believe their own eyes.
00:02:50 We're gonna fucking run them for all their worth.
00:02:52 We're gonna fucking slap them up. We're gonna fucking pat them down.
00:02:55 We're gonna fucking turn them inside out.
00:02:57 We're gonna fucking, you know, we're gonna fucking need them.
00:03:00 We're gonna like whisk them around.
00:03:02 We're gonna fucking add some second hot sauce in there.
00:03:05 We're gonna fucking drink them.
00:03:06 We're gonna drink them up. We're gonna drink them down.
00:03:08 Stupid clown hairs.
00:03:10 That's what we want. We want the clown.
00:03:13 We want to be associated.
00:03:14 Okay, let's just fucking play the game.
00:03:15 Yeah, let's play Wii Sports.
00:03:16 Before we can play Wii Sports, we have to make our own fucking Mi Sonas.
00:03:20 We have to make our own for Sonas.
00:03:21 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:22 With N.
00:03:23 I've made many of Mi before.
00:03:24 Yeah.
00:03:25 I have like a patented formula that produces incredible results.
00:03:29 Unlike Wii U, I have a ton of Mi's.
00:03:32 Pretty much all of them made at 3 o'clock in the morning.
00:03:35 Here, here.
00:03:36 I'm gonna go...
00:03:37 I've already created myself, but it's like a gay version of myself.
00:03:40 Nice.
00:03:41 Actually, you know what? Fuck it.
00:03:42 I'm just gonna use the gay version of myself.
00:03:44 You make yours.
00:03:45 Oh, okay.
00:03:46 Alright.
00:03:47 I've like whitewashed myself in my own memory.
00:03:50 Wait, wait, wait.
00:03:51 Why can't I see me?
00:03:52 Are you in control?
00:03:53 I think so.
00:03:54 Hold on.
00:03:55 Try now.
00:03:56 Try now.
00:03:57 Or here, just use mine.
00:03:58 What?
00:03:59 Fuck it.
00:04:00 I don't know.
00:04:01 Why don't I use mine?
00:04:02 Well, I don't know.
00:04:03 It just fucking works for some reason.
00:04:04 Well, yeah, it does.
00:04:05 You're in your menu.
00:04:06 Wait, what the fuck?
00:04:07 You're picking your me.
00:04:08 I think.
00:04:09 Maybe this is why the other remote wasn't working.
00:04:15 No, your light is on.
00:04:16 I know.
00:04:17 I think you just can't use two emotes in the me thing.
00:04:20 I don't know why.
00:04:22 Okay.
00:04:23 Just fucking use my controller.
00:04:25 My God.
00:04:26 Is this making new yet?
00:04:28 Yeah.
00:04:29 Alright, here we go.
00:04:31 Here we go.
00:04:33 Start from scratch.
00:04:35 Check out this cool choker.
00:04:37 I got it.
00:04:38 I was doing that first.
00:04:40 I was doing it with my black cop killer version.
00:04:43 Yeah.
00:04:44 I have the white purity version, which stands for fucking police dominance and fucking police
00:04:50 state.
00:04:51 Which one?
00:04:52 I think I use the...
00:04:57 This is so limited option.
00:04:58 There's like a thousand.
00:05:00 This one's mine.
00:05:02 It's yours.
00:05:03 Yeah, I own it.
00:05:05 Remember me Tomo?
00:05:06 Remember when that was real?
00:05:08 Yes.
00:05:09 What a good three days that was.
00:05:12 Yeah, me Tomo was pretty good for like a week there.
00:05:15 I had some good laughs.
00:05:17 I had some good times with me Tomo.
00:05:19 Made a couple of sweet tweets.
00:05:21 You probably came juggling down.
00:05:24 Juggling down.
00:05:25 Juggling down.
00:05:26 Juggling down.
00:05:27 Juggling down.
00:05:28 Honk.
00:05:29 There, there's my hair.
00:05:30 Oh my God.
00:05:31 That looks just like your hair.
00:05:32 I know, dude.
00:05:33 I know.
00:05:34 Unbelievable.
00:05:35 I want like this, but I want it like to be brown.
00:05:41 No, that comes later.
00:05:43 Oh, okay.
00:05:44 That comes later.
00:05:45 Uh, these eyebrows.
00:05:47 These eyebrows are fucking making me thirsty.
00:05:52 Not like that.
00:05:54 Is it like that?
00:05:56 No, that is not at all.
00:05:58 My hair looks so bad right now.
00:06:00 I like tried to like fluff it and it didn't work.
00:06:03 Look how Serena looks in your online persona though.
00:06:06 Yeah.
00:06:07 That's all that matters.
00:06:08 That's what I am.
00:06:09 Yeah, that's how I'm supposed to be.
00:06:10 All the, all the jobs make fun of me when I'm walking down the street and full of clown,
00:06:14 juggalo makeup.
00:06:15 I'll make fun of me and fucking arrest me and whatnot.
00:06:18 Every day when you're walking down the street and full of clown makeup.
00:06:22 They all make fun of me and fucking arrest me and say that I'm fucking illegal and I
00:06:28 can't be a juggalo anymore.
00:06:29 But when I, when I fucking go on my online RuneScape persona and when I start role playing,
00:06:34 when I start fucking ERPing, then this is how I look like and this, this is the real
00:06:39 me.
00:06:40 This is the true me.
00:06:41 No, that's not right.
00:06:42 Dude.
00:06:43 I think it's a formula.
00:06:44 I, yeah, but I forget it.
00:06:45 Is it this?
00:06:46 No.
00:06:47 Your eyes are for a part of this.
00:06:48 You look like a fucking...
00:06:49 A friend.
00:06:50 Man, what was the one that I used to use?
00:06:53 Actually, I have pictures on my Maitomo or on my Twitter from Maitomo.
00:06:57 You know what?
00:06:58 I'm going to look it up.
00:06:59 Excellent.
00:07:00 I'm going to look it up for maximum trees.
00:07:05 Fuck.
00:07:06 Just hold on everyone.
00:07:07 I'm sorry.
00:07:08 I'm sorry to waste your time.
00:07:10 No.
00:07:11 No.
00:07:12 We're not going to have this.
00:07:13 It's not about wasting time.
00:07:14 No.
00:07:15 It's about churning pure profit.
00:07:16 I, I, I'm sorry.
00:07:17 I'm sorry.
00:07:18 I'm sorry.
00:07:19 I'm sorry.
00:07:20 I'm sorry.
00:07:21 I'm sorry.
00:07:22 I'm sorry.
00:07:23 I'm sorry.
00:07:24 No.
00:07:25 It's about churning pure profit.
00:07:28 I, I, I mean saving juggalos.
00:07:32 Pay no attention to that last statement.
00:07:35 Oh god.
00:07:36 Yeah.
00:07:37 Here we go.
00:07:38 We swear we're one of you.
00:07:39 Please continue to donate to our PayPal to ensure the future of the juggalo race.
00:07:43 Please set up recurring payments to the Rowdyfuckers cop killers.
00:07:47 A PayPal account.
00:07:50 Untraceable.
00:07:51 Untraceable.
00:07:52 Do not leave your real name.
00:07:54 Uh, do not mention our real name.
00:07:56 The private cop killers can only be donated to through Bitcoin.
00:08:00 Yeah.
00:08:01 We, we, we have a partnership with Dogecoin actually.
00:08:04 And only an installment.
00:08:05 Well, only an install, you can only pay in Dogecoin, but you can only donate an installment's
00:08:10 worth one bit more.
00:08:12 So that's like 18,000 Dogecoins or something.
00:08:15 Uh, okay.
00:08:16 Here we go.
00:08:17 Got to look at my profile.
00:08:18 Got to go to media.
00:08:20 You're going to, you're going to be there awhile.
00:08:23 Yeah, but it'll be worth it.
00:08:24 You're going to be there while kid.
00:08:26 It'll be worth it.
00:08:27 Trust me.
00:08:28 Fucking.
00:08:29 Look at this.
00:08:30 Look at this child.
00:08:31 Oh shit.
00:08:32 The screen went black, bro.
00:08:33 Where?
00:08:34 Oh, uh.
00:08:35 Wow.
00:08:36 It's, it's tearing.
00:08:37 Let me just change the uh.
00:08:39 The settings.
00:08:40 Excellent.
00:08:41 Still select in?
00:08:42 Yeah.
00:08:43 Yeah.
00:08:45 Uh, screen saver done.
00:08:49 Wait, we're going to have to change power settings.
00:08:51 Oh my god.
00:08:52 This is our best episode ever.
00:08:55 Our set up right now is that we have like a webcam facing us, like a laptop up on top
00:09:01 of the television.
00:09:02 Like Vanity, I guess.
00:09:05 Then we have the, the TV and then Bin's 3DS is recording the screen of the fucking thing.
00:09:12 So both of these laptops have built in webcams.
00:09:14 We can't get even of them to work.
00:09:16 We could not fucking figure out how to actually operate them.
00:09:19 And then the mic connects to the 3DS.
00:09:20 So it's a fucked up weird saying, but you don't have to.
00:09:22 So I'm recording this through my 3DS.
00:09:23 Yeah.
00:09:24 The one that was paid for by my kickstarter.
00:09:25 Yeah.
00:09:26 For the, for the, for the Pokemon sun.
00:09:29 Dude, you send this video to all your kickstarter backers so they can get the full experience
00:09:32 of like, like, like, like every dollar they're paid with is going directly to this.
00:09:36 Yeah.
00:09:37 See, it's, it's, it's a cascade.
00:09:39 It's a cascading effect.
00:09:41 It's an S cascade.
00:09:42 This is the same width and like gravitas that cascaded has.
00:09:46 Okay.
00:09:47 At least in my opinion.
00:09:48 I feel like I'm getting closer.
00:09:49 I'm getting closer to the truth.
00:09:51 Striking pure fucking gold.
00:09:54 Which one of us would be Violin J and which one would be Shaggy Too Dope?
00:09:58 Um, that's tough because, because...
00:10:03 Keep in mind, Violin J is way skinnier nowadays.
00:10:07 So it's like not fat.
00:10:10 I mean...
00:10:11 I mean like relatively.
00:10:13 Well, who, which one's the brains of the operation and which one's the brawn?
00:10:16 I would say Violin J is extremely intelligent.
00:10:23 Yeah.
00:10:24 I would say that as well.
00:10:25 He has so much wisdom.
00:10:29 He talks about like being poor.
00:10:31 Yeah.
00:10:32 Beating women.
00:10:33 Yeah.
00:10:34 Smart.
00:10:35 Those are the only two things.
00:10:36 But trust me, there's a lot to say on that.
00:10:38 Smart man.
00:10:39 Good man.
00:10:40 Good man.
00:10:42 Where are you goddamn?
00:10:45 I hate the image that's on screen right now.
00:10:47 It doesn't look like it's not how I want to be.
00:10:50 I think it looks exactly like you.
00:10:52 For better or for worse.
00:10:53 It's actually, it's actually closer than I'm comfortable with.
00:10:57 It's in the uncanny valley.
00:10:59 That's unfortunate.
00:11:01 Hey Jackie.
00:11:03 Are we keeping you awake?
00:11:05 No.
00:11:07 All right.
00:11:08 I have options.
00:11:10 Then let us continue.
00:11:13 Excellent.
00:11:15 They're here.
00:11:16 They're here.
00:11:17 I know it.
00:11:18 I know it.
00:11:19 Our Juggalo names are like
00:11:21 Carcat, Vantaz.
00:11:24 And Therese Pyro.
00:11:26 Yeah.
00:11:27 Yeah.
00:11:28 Original.
00:11:29 Oh god.
00:11:30 I know they're here.
00:11:31 I know they're almost there.
00:11:32 I'm almost to the promised land of Mitomo.
00:11:36 Possibly.
00:11:37 I might have missed them.
00:11:38 This is like the most dangerous thing I've ever done in my life.
00:11:40 Yeah, it's pretty bad.
00:11:41 This right here.
00:11:42 I'm going to die.
00:11:43 This right here.
00:11:44 That's going to get me.
00:11:45 I'm going to give you the little Southern style right here.
00:11:47 The old, the old.
00:11:48 The old fucking workaround.
00:11:50 The old shakeshack.
00:11:51 I'm going to give you the clockwork orange he says.
00:11:53 Taping a fucking baking clock to an orange.
00:11:57 Come on.
00:11:58 Come now.
00:11:59 I know, I know, I'm in the right spot.
00:12:01 I'm in like the right era.
00:12:04 The viewers demand fucking expertise in this area.
00:12:08 Well, that's what I'm doing.
00:12:10 Art takes time.
00:12:12 Oh my god.
00:12:13 I'm just looking at my old art and I'm just such a genius.
00:12:17 I'm struck by my incredible skill and prowess.
00:12:21 Right here.
00:12:22 Uh.
00:12:23 There's that time that I ate an entire bottle's worth of multivitamins that had congealed
00:12:28 into a single puck.
00:12:29 That was pretty good.
00:12:30 That's pretty good.
00:12:31 That was a pretty good day.
00:12:32 That sort of lines up.
00:12:34 That lines up.
00:12:35 Yeah, yeah.
00:12:36 That's in character.
00:12:40 Frankly, I think Ben St. has become flanderized lately.
00:12:43 I agree.
00:12:44 I think he's been away from what he originally was.
00:12:46 What was I originally?
00:12:48 You know, unbelievable wisdom and fucking intelligence.
00:12:53 Yeah.
00:12:54 Nowadays, the writers are only playing up the fucking gross aspects of them.
00:13:00 Yeah.
00:13:01 Yeah, I have been flanderized.
00:13:03 I'm complex, damn it.
00:13:06 It's time to get back to the...
00:13:08 You know, I'll just nowadays start drama and make fun of brownies.
00:13:13 It's time to go back to the unbelievable fucking mirth and wisdom.
00:13:17 I found it.
00:13:18 Oh my god.
00:13:19 There we go.
00:13:21 The exact same.
00:13:23 I found myself.
00:13:25 They might not even have that on this version.
00:13:29 Wait, can you not do like pupil colors?
00:13:31 No, you can.
00:13:32 But I don't have that eye shape.
00:13:34 Oh god, no.
00:13:36 Phone, don't fuck me.
00:13:38 Don't fuck.
00:13:41 Do not fuck, please.
00:13:45 No, no, they do have that eye shape.
00:13:47 Wait, wait, wait.
00:13:48 Do they?
00:13:49 Oh yeah.
00:13:50 Second row, third to third.
00:13:52 Oh, I need yours.
00:13:54 Yeah.
00:13:55 Bumble fuck.
00:13:58 Bumble fuck.
00:13:59 I put it over here.
00:14:00 Okay, stupid.
00:14:01 Oh, I said something wrong because I'm stupid.
00:14:04 I'm gonna keep wrapping anyway.
00:14:07 Yeah, it was this one.
00:14:09 Yeah, that.
00:14:10 Okay, it just looks wrong because the pupils.
00:14:12 Yeah, brown.
00:14:14 You can put them...
00:14:16 No, far apart, no.
00:14:19 No, no, it's like this.
00:14:21 But then I put the glasses over it and it looks okay.
00:14:24 Trust me.
00:14:25 Pupils.
00:14:26 Fucking pupil colors.
00:14:27 Where?
00:14:29 No.
00:14:30 It looks so light on the screen.
00:14:32 Uh, whatever.
00:14:35 We're gonna be zoomed so fucking out.
00:14:37 We're gonna be, we're gonna fucking take that.
00:14:39 We're gonna zoom it out.
00:14:41 Yeah, you're right.
00:14:42 There should be a Disneyland ride based off
00:14:43 the Riforce Cop killers.
00:14:45 Oh, I wholeheartedly.
00:14:47 What an Epcot, actually.
00:14:48 Not even, not even Disney World in an Epcot.
00:14:51 Uh...
00:14:52 Dead Kids the Future of Fucking Humanity.
00:14:55 Dead kids are the future of humanity.
00:14:57 Dead kids?
00:14:58 Yeah, one day all kids will be dead and then our...
00:15:01 Yeah, in the future all kids living currently will be dead.
00:15:05 And I'm hoping, I'm hoping for that day.
00:15:08 I'm hoping for that day to come sooner rather than later.
00:15:11 Okay, okay, I gotta move everything down
00:15:13 because I have a big fucking forehead.
00:15:15 Oh my god.
00:15:16 Now we're coming.
00:15:17 This is fucking, this is going harder than I could ever imagine.
00:15:21 Uh, wait.
00:15:23 No, they don't have the nose that I wanted.
00:15:25 When I brought my weed down to do Wii Sports,
00:15:27 I never would have imagined that here standing before
00:15:29 a crowd of 35,000 people.
00:15:32 Exactly.
00:15:33 That we would ever have as broad of a reach as we do.
00:15:37 But with such quality content such as this.
00:15:44 Okay, I gotta bring...
00:15:46 Yeah, they don't have the right nose.
00:15:48 They do not have the nose that it's fucking Nintendo.
00:15:52 I mean, whatever.
00:15:54 All right, all right.
00:15:55 All right, all right, don't rush me.
00:15:56 Well, you can rush me a little bit.
00:15:59 This is fucking bullshit, doesn't matter.
00:16:01 No.
00:16:02 Yeah.
00:16:03 No, this one.
00:16:04 This is the one.
00:16:05 And like smaller, I guess.
00:16:07 Uh, yeah, a little smaller.
00:16:09 Perfect.
00:16:10 That's pretty good.
00:16:12 I don't actually know if they're going to have
00:16:14 the kind of beard you want.
00:16:16 Actually, for 100% they do not.
00:16:19 No, they don't.
00:16:24 Why would they have such limited beard options?
00:16:27 This is fucking poor.
00:16:29 This is fucking a poor.
00:16:32 They're going to like have...
00:16:34 You're going to like...
00:16:35 You're fucked.
00:16:36 There's nothing you can do.
00:16:37 Yeah, um...
00:16:38 Wait, wait, wait.
00:16:40 Maybe I can kind of like...
00:16:42 Maybe if I make it bigger, I can kind of...
00:16:44 Oh, that looks awful.
00:16:46 This looks so bad.
00:16:48 How is this ever acceptable?
00:16:49 You know what?
00:16:50 I kind of shave my beard.
00:16:51 I think I'm just going to go with like clean-shaven beard.
00:16:54 Okay, okay.
00:16:55 Like pseudo clean-shaven beard.
00:16:56 I think...
00:16:57 You're going for the classic bin.
00:16:58 So you can get back to what bin thing was all about.
00:17:00 Yeah.
00:17:01 The memes.

00:17:27 Dude, you're a black panther canonically within Wii Sports.
00:17:31 Canonically.
00:17:33 Who do you think's more conservative?
00:17:36 Juggalos or Green Party?
00:17:38 I'm going to go juggalos.
00:17:40 Yeah.
00:17:41 I'm definitely going to go juggalos.
00:17:43 Because juggalos are about like...
00:17:45 They're, they're, they're like wholesome.
00:17:47 Like, like, like hashtag juggalos are always right.
00:17:50 That's my opinion on the subject.

00:20:04 Time to get what you fucking clicked on this fucking video for. The unbelievable fucking majesty.
00:20:11 We're going to be playing the newest game release on the block. We just picked this up from GameStop.
00:20:15 Came out yesterday. We went to the midnight release. Yeah, but it's, it's, it's 2006. Yeah.
00:20:23 We're fucking, we're stroked and we're poked. I can't wait to play Red Steel and Twilight Princess.
00:20:29 I can't wait to play Call of Duty, the first one.
00:20:34 Fucking, I'm so ready. I'm gonna put on my wrist strap because you gotta have your wrist strap on.
00:20:38 Yeah, but mine doesn't have one. Okay, well, you're fucked. What the shit.
00:20:43 I can actually go and sue GameStop with that fucking asshole, Paul, trying to outsell me. Paul,
00:20:49 if you're watching this right now and you were, if you work at GameStop and your name is Paul,
00:20:52 fucking come to the comments. We're going to find you, give us your address, post them in the
00:20:56 comments below, and then you're going to figure out, you're going to figure out why Storm's a
00:21:00 named it for people. Fucking Paul, I go to pay for the Wii remote and he is like, I'm like,
00:21:10 I just make, I just make a small talk. I just make the observation that like, oh, when, when your
00:21:14 chip gets confirmed, it's like, it doesn't sound very encouraging. And then he's like, oh, well,
00:21:19 he's kind of thinking about it differently. Just imagine you're playing an eight-bit video game
00:21:22 and you're winning. Just like imagine that you're playing a video game and then the world will make
00:21:26 sense to you. And then the world will be true and real and just your fucking like, are you sure
00:21:33 you don't want to play it? Are you sure you want to get the power-ups card? And you're like, no.
00:21:36 You're like, you've never had one before and you're like, no. You're like, are you sure you don't
00:21:40 want one? You want to win us to point? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even for free points, you're like, no.
00:21:46 Did I just say no? Yeah. No, no. No. Like, I'm glad you finally got the message. Yeah. Like, good on
00:21:54 him. Oh, okay, okay, okay. We're going to play all these games, but what you want me to do first?
00:21:58 You want to go in order? Yeah, just go in order. Okay. Tennis. Tennis is like the most premiere,
00:22:03 like fucking like- I don't know about you, but my cardiovascular endurance is through the roof.
00:22:07 I dumped all my points into this. Yeah, I'm going to soda and then I'll fucking be there.
00:22:12 I'm going to the glittery- I guess it's water, whatever.
00:22:14 Power.

00:23:09 Oh my god. Your bones are fucking solidified right before my eyes. They just come apart
00:23:15 under under pressure. Under the right circumstances. Just like my personality. Well, I need a certain
00:23:21 some special somebody. Yes. Yeah, fucking me. Get it. You gotta hold it.
00:23:32 Hold it. Oh, uh, where's where's B? It's the it's the back one. Yeah. Okay. All right, come on.

00:23:58 All right, uh, yeah, it's the best of five.
00:24:02 This is right. It's not supposed to be punctual. I don't understand. No, no, you will.
00:24:07 Idiot.
00:24:12 God damn it. Oh, oh, oh my god. You're gonna fucking pay for your insolence.
00:24:19 We agree. We had a gentleman's agreement that you would lose this time. Yeah, well, I'm no gentleman.
00:24:27 God damn it. No.
00:24:31 It's a skill. Okay, this isn't true. This isn't true. I'm the best that we sport.
00:24:43 God damn it. I'm retarded.
00:24:47 All right. No, don't worry. No, don't worry audience. Don't worry.
00:24:50 God, the timing. I hate this replay.
00:24:54 I hate this fucking replay.
00:25:00 Idiot. Fucking moron. I can't believe you made a blender such as that in these how and hauls.
00:25:12 Fuck yeah. How do I even control the angle?
00:25:15 Fuck. Damn it. Wait, do you just, do we not pass the serve back and forth?
00:25:25 I don't know. Like, aren't you supposed to lose the serve when you, when I-
00:25:29 No, I think if I get a point, then you get it.
00:25:38 Fuck. Fuck yes. The game is just like you do it once and then you get an hour or you lose.
00:25:43 Yeah. Like, there's no, there's no coming back from a blender.
00:25:47 Yeah.
00:25:53 Or is there?
00:25:55 Oh, oh, oh, oh. Yes. Go, go. Oh, come on. Oh, no.
00:26:02 That happened. What an incredible volley. What an incredible victory for me.
00:26:06 No, fuck. I don't mean to keep doing that. This is unbearable.
00:26:10 That was fucking sick. That was fucking epic.
00:26:13 I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna turn you into a fucking Native American.
00:26:18 Never. No. Yes. I should have just let it go.
00:26:22 Fucking yes. I want to see a rea- Ah, fuck.
00:26:27 I'm gonna make you fucking emit greenhouse gases from your fucking nose.
00:26:32 Fuck. How do I make them go faster? Is there any way for that to be the case?
00:26:36 I have no idea. I'm-
00:26:38 Fuck.
00:26:43 Fuck. How is he-
00:26:45 Fuck, yes.
00:26:45 How is he even supposed to do it?
00:26:47 Ha, there's no way.

00:26:54 No!
00:26:57 Dude.
00:26:58 You fucked, idiot.
00:27:00 Don't worry. My idiocy has nothing to do with my ability to play or win, Tennis.
00:27:07 No!
00:27:10 This is fucking retarded. It doesn't make any sense.
00:27:13 How am I supposed to do?
00:27:17 Yeah, like how do you even control the angle?
00:27:27 Damn it!
00:27:28 That incredible edge-guarding. The net-guarding skill.
00:27:31 I'm not doing anything differently.
00:27:36 This doesn't even matter. This isn't even fucking real.
00:27:40 Oh, I should have gone for it at the net.
00:27:43 Come on!
00:27:44 Yes!
00:27:45 Fuck yeah.
00:27:50 Fuck yeah. Fuck yes. Fuck yes. It doesn't even matter.

00:28:13 Yes!
00:28:16 Did it like matter which direction I swing?
00:28:18 I have no clue.

00:28:35 All right.
00:28:40 No!
00:28:41 That doesn't even count.
00:28:44 See that incredible restraint that I showed there?
00:28:48 You knew, you knew.
00:28:49 Then say the legendary restraint attribute.
00:28:55 Damn it, that doesn't even make any sense.
00:28:57 That doesn't make any sense.
00:29:00 If we're being honest with ourselves, that doesn't make any sense.
00:29:02 Uh, I don't, I don't have any opinion about that.
00:29:05 And, and frankly I'm confused.
00:29:06 No, yes, yes, oh my god, that was gay.
00:29:14 All right, okay.
00:29:17 I need to come back from the fucking courthouse.
00:29:20 Okay, well, well, all right.
00:29:22 If I lose, I'm going to go to fucking jail.
00:29:25 Yep, that's the agreement.
00:29:27 That's the jailman's agreement that we had.
00:29:33 Fucking I hate you.
00:29:34 God damn it.
00:29:37 Whatever, doesn't even make any sense.
00:29:40 This game has no fucking rules.
00:29:45 Yes.
00:29:46 Damn it, no!
00:29:47 Look at the determination in my eyes.
00:29:50 This is fucking retarded.
00:29:53 No, never play again, quit.
00:29:55 Wait, that took like 30 minutes.
00:29:57 Oh wait, wait, I'm including the, making the video.
00:29:59 Yeah, but okay, fucking, this is such,
00:30:03 even though that was a cheat, even though you cheated,
00:30:05 and even, even though that was conclu, conclusion at play,
00:30:08 and you fucking sucked the dick of the referee in order to get that point through,
00:30:12 like 9% of those points.
00:30:13 That seems like the kind of thing I would do.
00:30:15 Even though that, this is a great change of pace,
00:30:17 from the fucking awful, rigorous, you know, like, like, this is our vacation.
00:30:22 This is our vacation from the living nightmare that is frog fractures.
00:30:25 Yeah, yeah, we finally got, and now we get to take a break and fucking relax,
00:30:28 you know, limber up our muscles, fucking butter up our assholes and fucking,
00:30:32 just go to town.

00:51:17 No, that's definitely not true.
00:51:23 I forgot.
00:51:26 All right, well.
00:51:34 You're definitely gonna fucking knock that DS, by the way.
00:51:40 Oh my god.
00:51:40 At one point, did I win?
00:51:42 Yes.
00:51:44 Fuck.
00:51:45 Yes.
00:51:45 God.
00:51:45 That is the face of a fucking loser.
00:51:48 That's the face of a fucking racist.
00:51:51 You didn't let the buffalo stampede on your ground.
00:51:54 And now I'm gonna stampede on your heart.
00:51:56 What a mistake.
00:51:58 Shit.
00:51:59 You wouldn't sell the land back to the people you stole it from,
00:52:01 and now you're gonna pay dearly in hell.
00:52:04 I didn't want it bad enough.
00:52:06 That's what happened.
00:52:09 Fuck you.
00:52:10 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
00:52:12 I'm representing all, no, I didn't want to do anything.
00:52:14 No, no, no, no, no, no.
00:52:15 I represent all Native Americans.
00:52:18 Yeah, you speak for them.
00:52:19 And you represent all whites.
00:52:20 He speaks for them.
00:52:22 I speak for the trees.
00:52:25 I speak for the people without voices,
00:52:26 aka all Native Americans.
00:52:27 They can't speak for themselves.
00:52:30 Don't worry, guys.
00:52:31 If you're a Native American, don't worry.
00:52:32 I'll do it for you.
00:52:34 All right.
00:52:35 An expert.
00:52:36 Oh god, I'm full with.
00:52:38 Nigh-hole.
00:52:38 You want to namp Nigh-
00:52:39 Let's do a Nigh-hole.
00:52:39 Yeah, let's do a Nigh-hole.
00:52:43 Fuck yes.
00:52:43 Fuck yes.
00:52:47 Okay, we're still going.
00:52:48 No problem.
00:52:49 No problems yet.
00:52:50 Fuck yeah.
00:52:51 Let me show me up my hips.
00:52:54 Here, let me lower it.
00:53:00 All right, that's it.
00:53:09 Okay, didn't mean to do that.
00:53:11 Okay, good.
00:53:18 All right, how do I play the game?
00:53:20 You can.
00:53:21 That's not a feature that comes with the game.
00:53:27 All right, okay, I am.
00:53:32 Oh my god.
00:53:33 Sliced it or something.
00:53:35 I fucking diced it, bro.
00:53:37 Look how fucking powerful that was.
00:53:39 Hold on, hold on.
00:53:42 I'm going to center this a little better.
00:53:45 There we go.
00:53:45 Okay.
00:53:46 Excellent.
00:53:47 Just try.
00:53:48 Just try.
00:53:48 I'm going.
00:53:49 Just try.
00:53:49 I'm going.
00:53:51 You give me a second.
00:53:51 Cheese, dude.
00:53:52 Okay, okay.
00:53:54 Wait, so what do I do?
00:53:55 Do I have to hold a button?
00:53:57 I don't know.
00:53:59 Fuck you.
00:54:01 You fucking, you hold down A and then you like swing it.
00:54:04 Just like.
00:54:05 No, like a fucking club.
00:54:07 Like a golf.
00:54:09 Do it like a golf.
00:54:12 Do I have to release A when I hit?
00:54:14 I don't think so.
00:54:18 Oh, idiot.
00:54:35 All right.
00:54:48 Where, where?
00:54:48 Oh, oh fuck.
00:54:50 Oh fuck.
00:54:51 How do I?
00:54:51 Is it because I'm still closer or something?
00:54:53 I guess.
00:55:01 I guess I just drove hard into the paint.
00:55:06 All right, sure.
00:55:09 Okay, okay.
00:55:10 You're roughed it.
00:55:10 You're roughed it, bro.
00:55:11 Okay, whatever.
00:55:12 You're roughing it.
00:55:12 Oh god, look at me.
00:55:13 Look how serene I am.
00:55:14 Look how fucking beautiful.
00:55:21 What the fuck?
00:55:23 You're gonna hold, you have to hold A.
00:55:25 I know, I know, but I'm trying to like test it.
00:55:27 This seriously makes no sense to me.
00:55:29 Yeah.
00:55:31 It's just like you just, you just hit it.
00:55:33 I don't know what your deal is.
00:55:35 I just, what?
00:55:39 Oh no.
00:55:40 Oh no.
00:55:44 Yeah, okay, sure.
00:55:47 Driver.
00:55:51 Oh, I see.
00:55:53 Okay, I want to go with like
00:55:58 fuck, power.
00:56:02 What?
00:56:02 I fucking swung.
00:56:03 It didn't, great.
00:56:07 Did it clip the tree?
00:56:08 I, I don't know what's going on.
00:56:10 I have no clue what's fucking going on.
00:56:14 I think I hate this game.
00:56:15 Yeah, that's probably the worst thing
00:56:17 we've ever done in our lives.
00:56:19 There's gonna be nine holes, nine holes of this.
00:56:21 Good.
00:56:34 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
00:56:37 Excellent.
00:56:39 Truly remarkable.
00:57:01 What the fuck?
00:57:04 What are you putting this on at?
00:57:06 What?
00:57:08 You were like, you like practiced it so carefully.
00:57:10 Yeah.
00:57:10 And then like, oh, here we go.
00:57:21 Worthless.
00:57:30 No.
00:57:31 I think that was, no, no.
00:57:34 Nine holes, nine holes was a mistake.
00:57:38 Yeah, this was, this was a horrible idea.
00:57:41 Okay.
00:57:42 I don't even want to do one.
00:57:44 No.
00:57:47 I mean,
00:57:52 all right.
00:57:56 I'm probably getting the hang of this game
00:57:57 and the more I understand the less I want to play it.
00:58:00 We can stop early, maybe.
00:58:02 No.
00:58:03 Okay, never mind.
00:58:04 That was a lie.
00:58:10 Fuck.
00:58:13 Idiot.
00:58:15 Maximum over putt.
00:58:19 I'm gonna put you in the next week.
00:58:22 Shit, Christ, idiot.
00:58:37 I'm so effing.
00:58:39 You are.
00:58:40 You could walk into fucking Kanye West's apartment.
00:58:43 He wouldn't even know.
00:58:45 You're so sneaky.
00:58:49 Idiot.
00:58:52 I'm like, can't, we're just playing.
00:59:08 Yep.
00:59:15 Okay.
00:59:17 Oh, it.
00:59:22 It has no fucking clue.
00:59:29 Oh, no.
00:59:31 It has absolutely no idea.
00:59:33 It does.
00:59:33 It doesn't know where my remote is.
00:59:38 I just have to fucking pray.
00:59:39 Yeah.
00:59:44 That would have been perfect.
00:59:48 Oh, oh, no, no, no.
00:59:51 I'm never gonna get that in, by the way.
00:59:53 I will never get that in my entire life.
00:59:54 No, it's gonna glitch out.
01:00:01 Okay.
01:00:03 Yep.
01:00:14 Fuck.
01:00:17 You're fucking dead, kid.
01:00:18 Damn it.
01:00:21 Dude, it's like trying to get the ball into the hole
01:00:23 from this length is like being sweet bro and hello, Jeff.
01:00:25 Trying to get the ball out of the door.
01:00:27 I need to know what angel to eat.
01:00:30 It gets impossible.
01:00:32 Like the closer you are, the harder it gets.
01:00:38 Fuck.
01:00:39 Oh, oh, oh.
01:00:40 Never mind.
01:00:41 Now it's wrong.
01:00:42 Yes.
01:00:42 I was wrong about what I said.
01:00:45 I figured out the angel.
01:00:47 You figured out the angel.
01:00:49 Fuck yes.
01:00:49 Someday.
01:00:50 Hey, hey, hey.
01:00:51 Do you think you're gonna never mind?
01:00:55 Please.
01:00:57 Please never make it in.
01:00:59 Please never win this game.
01:01:07 What?
01:01:08 It's doing the opposite of what I tell it to.
01:01:11 No.
01:01:13 Look, I swing it and it goes backwards.
01:01:15 It's not precise enough to actually do measurements.
01:01:18 So it's just like you have to just fucking hope.
01:01:22 You have to hope with all your fucking dick in your heart.
01:01:29 Don't fuck it up.
01:01:30 Okay.
01:01:31 Fuck.
01:01:32 Tripping bogey.
01:01:37 Fuck yes.
01:01:38 All right, all right.
01:01:39 Second hole of a nine hole game.
01:01:41 Oh my god.
01:01:43 Jesus.
01:01:45 Yeah, just go right into the sand trap.
01:01:47 That's what I want to see.
01:01:51 Yes.
01:01:59 Oh, that delay.
01:02:02 Okay.
01:02:04 Is your skull just lagged?
01:02:07 I don't know.
01:02:15 I don't understand what the fuck is happening.
01:02:19 That's pretty good.
01:02:20 Mike on the sand trap.
01:02:23 No.
01:02:25 No, it actually sucked dig.
01:02:29 All right, all right, all right.
01:02:30 Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six.
01:02:37 You're definitely holding one, dude.
01:02:47 Dude, we're holding fucking one.
01:02:51 Okay.
01:02:55 Oh my god.
01:02:56 Oh my god.
01:03:06 Oh my god.
01:03:07 I was going back and it registered me going forward.
01:03:10 That was awesome.
01:03:23 Whatever.
01:03:24 Oh, in the hard rough.
01:03:26 Oh my god.
01:03:29 You're on stroke five.
01:03:30 I have to go.
01:03:31 All right.
01:03:39 Six.
01:03:43 Okay.
01:03:43 Okay.
01:03:43 Okay.
01:03:44 This doesn't matter.
01:03:44 It doesn't matter.
01:03:45 Thoughtful, thoughtful approach.
01:03:51 You're a thought.
01:03:52 I'm going to approach you with a fucking knife.
01:03:56 Okay.
01:04:05 I think maybe because I was kind of using with my wrists
01:04:07 and it didn't like that.
01:04:13 Okay.
01:04:13 Apparently I can't hit it at max power.
01:04:15 I can only hit it at three quarters.
01:04:17 Okay.
01:04:17 Cool.
01:04:18 Whatever.
01:04:18 That's fine.
01:04:21 Fuck.
01:04:21 Okay.
01:04:21 Well, I guess you did that time.
01:04:24 Oh.
01:04:25 Oh.
01:04:29 Done.
01:04:31 That's for retards, as I like to say.
01:04:46 Good.
01:04:47 You did it.
01:04:49 Oh, hey, no, you get to go again.
01:04:50 It's good.
01:04:55 I thought I was using the putter again.
01:04:58 Oh, there's a tree in the way.
01:05:00 Tree in the way.
01:05:01 I did not, did not, did not start me off with the,
01:05:03 with the off hub I was using.
01:05:05 No.
01:05:05 No.
01:05:05 Did you just switch to a random one right now?
01:05:07 I think it just switches automatically to the one
01:05:09 that it thinks is like the best match, distance-wise.
01:05:13 Okay.
01:05:13 I want to see it bounce off that tree, dude.
01:05:16 Oh, okay.
01:05:18 No.
01:05:21 Fuck.
01:05:21 Well, you almost got it.
01:05:23 What?
01:05:26 Did it just make you give up?
01:05:27 It just forced me to give up?
01:05:29 I think it did.
01:05:30 Oh, I think it was because you got six stirrups behind,
01:05:32 so it was just like-
01:05:33 Oh, fucking dumb.
01:05:34 You can't win.
01:05:34 Fuck you.
01:05:37 I guess it's to avoid a blowout where someone
01:05:39 spends like 40 turns on one.
01:05:41 Yeah.
01:05:41 And then it's just like, well, it's pointless from here.
01:05:43 Yeah.
01:05:45 Yep.
01:05:50 No.
01:05:51 This game fucking sucks.
01:05:59 All right.
01:06:01 It don't matter.
01:06:05 What kind of fucking barbarian fucking like ruthless,
01:06:09 uncivilized, non-gentified fucking society do you have to be
01:06:13 in order to invent golf?
01:06:16 To invent golf?
01:06:17 Yeah.
01:06:17 You have to be a savage.
01:06:20 You have to be less than human.
01:06:24 Then Neanderthals invented golf, and then the humans,
01:06:27 and then the primitive humans just ate them.
01:06:29 And they took up golf to mock them.
01:06:32 Yeah.
01:06:34 That's how the Neanderthals would extinct,
01:06:35 that people would just use golf clubs to beat the shit out of them.
01:06:39 You know, they're fun.
01:06:41 Like you do.
01:06:43 Hope you don't fucking die every shame.
01:06:46 Yeah.
01:06:48 Yeah, I could see that.
01:06:48 Worst things have happened.
01:06:50 Worst things have happened today.
01:06:55 All right.
01:06:56 Just win.
01:06:57 Wow.
01:06:58 Just kidding.
01:06:58 I meant lose.
01:07:02 Oh, no.
01:07:03 No.
01:07:04 No.
01:07:04 Idiot.
01:07:04 Dumb.
01:07:07 I ruined it.
01:07:09 Hey, it's me, it's me, it's KC Green.
01:07:14 It's KC Green.
01:07:15 I hope you all got your faces right.
01:07:18 I got my face right.
01:07:19 Let's go in here.
01:07:20 Let's go.
01:07:20 If I lose, I'm going to turn into a fucking...
01:07:25 It's not another race.
01:07:32 Fuck.
01:07:33 Yes.
01:07:34 Bitch.
01:07:38 Fake.
01:07:38 Boo to that.
01:07:39 You are fake.
01:07:40 Boo to that.
01:07:42 You are a fake bitch.
01:07:44 Sure.
01:07:45 You are basic.
01:07:49 Why will...
01:07:54 Look, it's like we got my...
01:07:56 Oh, because I'm on the rough.
01:07:58 My power is limited because I'm on the rough.
01:08:01 Now I understand.
01:08:04 Whatever.
01:08:05 Yeah, good.
01:08:07 Excellent.
01:08:07 But yep, good.
01:08:10 Sick.
01:08:11 That doesn't matter.
01:08:11 That's fine.
01:08:12 Yeah.
01:08:13 That's fine.
01:08:14 That's almost out of bounds, dawg.
01:08:15 That's fine.
01:08:16 That's fine, dude.
01:08:16 It's not blows.
01:08:17 It sucks.
01:08:18 No, no.
01:08:19 That has no bearing.
01:08:20 That has zero homes.
01:08:24 You could do it.
01:08:25 If you fucking max powered it,
01:08:26 you could like get it on the green.
01:08:28 What the...
01:08:29 What?
01:08:32 Wait, what?
01:08:34 What?
01:08:36 Where's the ball?
01:08:39 Show us the ball.
01:08:45 Oh, no.
01:08:46 There we go.
01:08:47 You're fucking dead, dude.
01:08:52 Yeah, that was pretty cool, I gotta say.
01:08:55 I just had to wiggle it a little bit.
01:08:57 Oh my god.
01:08:59 Oh my fucking god.
01:09:02 Get ready.
01:09:02 Get ready for your dick to be blown off.
01:09:06 I will do.
01:09:09 Shit.
01:09:12 Oh, that sucked.
01:09:15 Kill me.
01:09:16 All right, all right.
01:09:19 I'm back and I'm ready for action.
01:09:21 You've got attitude.
01:09:22 You've got attitude.
01:09:25 You're gonna make me fucking...
01:09:26 You're gonna purr once I see you.
01:09:28 Gross.
01:09:38 No?
01:09:39 Fuck.
01:09:39 I was...
01:09:39 No?
01:09:40 All right.
01:09:42 Fuck.
01:09:43 I remember when I first played this game.
01:09:47 And I thought, man, the motion controls are hard to use.
01:09:49 I don't know if they're gonna catch on.
01:09:51 And I was like, no.
01:09:52 No, bro.
01:09:53 This is the future.
01:09:58 Looks like you fucking have the right idea you called it.
01:10:07 Why does the...
01:10:08 Why is the putter just lie to you, by the way?
01:10:09 Why does it not appreciate what its actual max power is and like the range?
01:10:14 I don't pretend to understand golf.
01:10:17 I only pretend to love it.
01:10:24 Exactly.
01:10:25 It's like I'm impressed by fucking foolhardy friends.
01:10:33 Look at the difference between max power and no power.
01:10:36 No power?
01:10:38 Max power.
01:10:39 You are gonna learn so much when I'm coming through with you.
01:10:50 God, I just want to get like near max.
01:10:54 You're gonna learn the three reasons why people don't talk to people.
01:10:59 Because things like this could happen.
01:11:00 Yes, yes, yes.
01:11:01 Oh my god.
01:11:01 Run, run, run.
01:11:03 Shit.
01:11:08 What the fuck?
01:11:31 Fuck.
01:11:32 God damn it.
01:11:32 Yes, I have so much bend.
01:11:37 What you're lacking up is right here.
01:11:39 You're lacking is right up here.
01:11:41 You're lacking a little bit up the stairs.
01:11:42 Are you talking about my sixth chakra?
01:11:46 You just can't open your eye a little bit and then you're gonna be able to see clearly.
01:11:57 Wrong.
01:11:58 Wrong.
01:11:58 What do you mean?
01:11:59 Wrong.
01:12:01 It knows.
01:12:02 It's good.
01:12:03 Wrong.
01:12:03 It's nice.
01:12:04 What is this whole four?
01:12:07 Okay.
01:12:08 I don't know how much more I can take.
01:12:09 Maybe one more or I don't know.
01:12:11 No, we signed up.
01:12:12 We signed up for it.
