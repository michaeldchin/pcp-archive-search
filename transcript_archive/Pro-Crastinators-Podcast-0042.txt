00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:28 I am the best guy ever and I am here today with Hippocrit.
00:00:44 I haven't seen you with a tiny hat in a while, I'm getting disillusioned and also Digibro.
00:00:49 I'm still alive, somehow, despite all that drug and alcohol content.
00:01:01 Our topic for today is the elusive, mysterious concept of a convention, specifically a nerd,
00:01:10 geek, stupid, retard convention for babies who poop in their diapers.
00:01:15 Which you, as I understand, are a huge fan of.
00:01:17 I love more than pooping my own diaper, I love to poop in other people's diapers, and
00:01:23 smear it all over my manhood.
00:01:26 Right, so we're talking about conventions.
00:01:29 So I know that Digi and I and Munchy have been to conventions, Gibb, what's your experience
00:01:34 with conventions?
00:01:35 Well, I've been to three conventions ever, the first one was London Expo, I don't know
00:01:45 what it was called, I think it was just called the London Expo and it's this huge big thing
00:01:49 in London, near the river, and it was just nerd stuff, there was games, there was anime,
00:01:56 it was all sorts of stuff, I got a Phoenix Wright book and some badges for Hitman Reborn
00:02:03 and I don't know, I was going there with friends and it was really my first experience
00:02:08 of seeing cosplayers in real life and it was actually a lot cooler than I thought it would
00:02:12 be.
00:02:14 That was that.
00:02:15 Then there was...
00:02:16 Well, those good cosplayers, yeah.
00:02:17 Yeah, and then the second one was the Bronycon, which is slightly documented on my channel
00:02:22 on Gibb and Tay, and that was the first time I met you guys, in fact all of you in school
00:02:30 is the first time I met you in real life.
00:02:33 And after that is Radcon 1 and 2 and that's it.
00:02:37 Oh, I know those.
00:02:39 That's a conference though, it's not a convention.
00:02:41 That's close enough.
00:02:43 It was certainly a con, I feel ripped off.
00:02:46 Yeah, I got'em.
00:02:50 It's gay.
00:02:51 Well, okay, I don't know about you guys, but I have not been, I mean yes, I went to
00:02:57 Bronycon with you guys, but that was like for a good reason.
00:03:00 When I was young, I used to go to anime conventions very frequently and would cosplay and would
00:03:07 be really excited for them, even though I always had a shitty time, but now I realized
00:03:12 it's kind of like my experience with D&D, when I was young I got really excited for it,
00:03:15 but now I realize that they're terrible and I don't enjoy them at all, but it's possible
00:03:19 that there's new ways for me to experience them, and in the future I'll figure out ways
00:03:24 to make them fun.
00:03:26 And looking forward to that one day, for example, doing a panel and being praised by the public
00:03:31 for my genius and my creative abilities, that would be cool.
00:03:34 I kind of feel like I missed out on the con experience, because the second con I went
00:03:38 to, I was already on a panel, and the first con I went to, I wasn't really doing anything,
00:03:42 I was just walking around overwhelmed by it, but I kind of liked, you know, I saw somebody
00:03:48 in a Luffy, like they cosplayed as when Luffy was wearing wax on his hands and feet.
00:03:55 Yeah, Champion Luffy, I remember that.
00:03:57 Yeah, and I was just like, whoa, this is like things I know and like, and people are making
00:04:01 good costumes, and there's like a fucking metric ton of key blades, I didn't really know
00:04:07 how that was.
00:04:09 Yeah, I kind of wish I was going to cons earlier, because they seemed like fun for a kid, or
00:04:15 a young teenager, and I missed out.
00:04:18 Oh, and which I am, and greatly enjoy.
00:04:23 Allegedly.
00:04:24 I think you're an undercover adult.
00:04:27 I think you're trying, I think what you are, are a plant by the FBI to convict us all of
00:04:32 pedophilia.
00:04:33 That's what I suspect you are.
00:04:34 You're trying to bait us into it, but I'm not going to crack.
00:04:36 In Andrew Hussie's webcomic, whistles the clown, there's a species of plants that only
00:04:41 eat clowns, and that's what I am.
00:04:43 I'm a plant that only eats clowns.
00:04:48 I've been to a few conventions in my day, but which ones did you go to?
00:04:54 I've mostly been to Otacon a bunch of times, and it's sort of similar to Unate.
00:05:01 The first time I ever went to Otacon was in 2008, and it was the greatest experience
00:05:07 of my life.
00:05:08 It was mind-blowing, and life-changing, it was the coolest thing ever, and every single
00:05:13 year since, it has been worse.
00:05:16 Like progressively, it's less and less interesting, less and less fun, and there was one time
00:05:23 that I went to NecoCon, which is a local anime convention, and that was enough.
00:05:31 I went to one local convention, and my conclusion was local conventions aren't worth it.
00:05:36 You go to the big ones.
00:05:37 That's definitely true.
00:05:38 Because there's nothing at a local convention.
00:05:40 It's just an excuse for a bunch of nerds to stand around together.
00:05:47 There are a few functions that are served by a convention.
00:05:51 Mostly my experience is with anime conventions, and to me, they serve as A, a gathering place
00:05:57 for like-minded people.
00:05:59 That one is already horrible, because I've never met a person at a convention I liked.
00:06:04 It's always been terrible.
00:06:05 Yeah, that's fair.
00:06:06 I mean, it is a huge gathering place for autism.
00:06:08 It simply is, and I don't like hanging out with autistic people.
00:06:12 They make me uncomfortable.
00:06:13 More so than autism, just nerds.
00:06:15 I mean, I would say we're all on the spectrum there when it comes to nerds, but it's not
00:06:22 even that most of them are weird.
00:06:25 They're just kind of awkward, or have a different sense of humor.
00:06:28 I feel like the problem that I have with nerds in general of hanging out with them is that
00:06:34 nerds are a class of people who think that having a shared knowledge is the same thing
00:06:39 as having a personality, or a joke is simply stating a reference to a thing, and at conventions,
00:06:49 that's really amplified to the upteeth degree, where you could have a panel going on and
00:06:56 someone makes reference to, and not all shows are good, and then someone in the crowd is
00:07:01 going to go, like, guards is wing, and then people go, I also know what that is, and that
00:07:07 kind of shit, that's the element of conventions that always makes me want to not be there
00:07:12 anymore.
00:07:13 I don't blame people for wanting to share that kind of relationship with each other.
00:07:19 It's just that that, with the absence of a decent person behind it, or just a personality
00:07:25 behind it, that's where it's a problem.
00:07:27 I agree.
00:07:28 I hate conventions.
00:07:29 Don't go.
00:07:30 I think people who are awkward are awkward, and fuck them, but I do appreciate the nerdy
00:07:36 convention area for allowing real human beings like us to convene, because like, BronyCon
00:07:43 was like, I mean, at the time everyone was kind of tired of the pony stuff, but it was
00:07:50 just really cool to just go to a place and generally know people that know you.
00:07:55 I need some huge scare quotes on real people when it comes to us.
00:08:02 I'm real, I think.
00:08:04 That's true.
00:08:05 But really, I wanted to talk about what is the function that a convention serves that
00:08:09 draws people to it, because you've talked about this before, Digi, and how, like, the
00:08:13 only thing that you can get out them.
00:08:15 I think it's precisely because it's mostly nerds, because nerds don't go out and have
00:08:23 friends.
00:08:24 This is their only chance to get together and make their stupid jokes and not be ridiculed
00:08:30 for it.
00:08:31 They just want an internet forum, but in IRL, you know, IRL, internet forum.
00:08:35 But see, okay, you know, that's true, that's true, but all right, it's just a much bigger
00:08:41 deal for everyone, so which is why it keeps getting funded all over the place in different
00:08:44 forms.
00:08:45 Yeah.
00:08:46 And I mean, maybe people have figured this out better than me, all right, but I've got
00:08:48 an axe to grind here, because I kind of had this idea when I was young, and I started
00:08:53 going to conventions.
00:08:54 Me and my brother went to anime Boston every year for, like, eight years, and...
00:08:58 Your brother being Ben St.
00:09:00 Ben St.
00:09:01 Ben St.
00:09:02 That's right.
00:09:03 Not up on the times here.
00:09:04 That's true.
00:09:06 And Connecticut, which is a smaller one, and was less worth our time, but still went occasionally,
00:09:10 and I've been to a few here and there.
00:09:12 The highlight of my entire congoing experience was when I found out that, and this is like
00:09:17 one of the things that cons are useful for, actually, Yoshitaka Amano, illustrator of
00:09:23 Final Fantasy, was at, like, New York, not Comic-Con, but like some New York comic convention,
00:09:28 and me and a friend from my anime club and college found out, and she wanted to go.
00:09:34 I can't remember why.
00:09:35 Um, actually, this was funny.
00:09:37 This was when Gurren Logan had just taken off in a big way, and I had not seen it yet,
00:09:41 so we went to the convention, everything was Gurren Logan, and I had no idea what any of
00:09:45 it was.
00:09:46 It was...
00:09:47 It's funny to think it back to that.
00:09:48 Crazy.
00:09:49 But anyway, I met Amano there and got to shake his hand and have his autograph that I have
00:09:53 to this day, and that was like the best thing Akon has ever provided for me.
00:09:57 But when I was a little kid, what I wanted out of an anime convention was nerd friends,
00:10:03 and I would go there, I got dressed up like fucking Monkey D. Luffy, I sewed my costume
00:10:08 with my mom for weeks, if not months, worked really hard on it, got together, you know,
00:10:12 all my money so I could afford to buy things and have a fun time there, and I went there,
00:10:17 and I stood in halls, and I walked around, and I looked at things, and no friends appeared
00:10:23 to me.
00:10:24 No friends magically sprung up for me, and I will never forgive conventions for hyping
00:10:29 me up for making friends and then not delivering.
00:10:31 I'll never forget the disappointment I had when I was coming home, and I had just spent
00:10:36 a bunch of money on anime bullshit I didn't need or want, and was still a sad child.
00:10:43 That was cruel of you, fucking anime Boston, that was very cruel of you.
00:10:47 How cruel and unusual to present merchandise, and then have the option to buy it.
00:10:53 That is, resist capitalism, baby!
00:10:59 I kind of like that whole like, I mean, not like being sad, I mean like making a costume
00:11:06 and being a bit of a loser faggot idiot, making a costume, wearing a costume.
00:11:11 I kind of want to do that still, like even though I know there's nothing to really be
00:11:15 gained from it.
00:11:16 I kind of want to make like a really terrible home stuff come play of some kind.
00:11:19 Well that's the thing though, it's fun, it's fun in and of itself.
00:11:20 And then to go with friends though, it's totally different.
00:11:25 I never went with friends, I went with my brother who it wasn't cool to hang out with
00:11:28 and my mom.
00:11:30 So, like I was just there hoping things would happen for me, and they didn't.
00:11:36 Nate, we have to understand this, the reason I like cons, because I exclusively go to cons
00:11:41 with friends, and it's always a fucking blast.
00:11:45 Because really like the difference between going to Disneyland by yourself and with friends.
00:11:50 Exactly.
00:11:51 Like there's stuff to do, but it doesn't feel the same.
00:11:53 I'll say that I do think part of what has made cons that are like Otacon weaker for
00:11:59 me year after year, is that like I do go with my friends, but we don't stay together.
00:12:05 We all split up and go do different things, and we don't really hang out during, like
00:12:10 Victor always, my brother Victor, he always goes with his girlfriend Hope, you know,
00:12:14 and so they, like he immediately fucks off to hang out with her the whole time, you know,
00:12:19 even if we, I mean last year he drove up with her, but it used to be he'd come with us,
00:12:22 and she would just happen to also, you know, be going.
00:12:26 But then like, you know, my other friends, we all have kind of different, you know, anime
00:12:31 we're interested in, or different things we want to see, so we all just split up and
00:12:34 we rarely end up encountering each other, and it can be weird, like going around to
00:12:39 this stuff alone, and then just kind of feeling like, is this, like does this mean that much
00:12:45 to me, that I'm like, that I'm willing to, you know, drive four and a half hours and
00:12:50 spend all this money just to like be in this place, so I can sit alone and, you know, and
00:12:56 just see this thing that I've seen some variation of eight times already, you know, no matter
00:13:02 what it is.
00:13:03 Yeah.
00:13:04 To me, it feels really like 2006, in the sense of like, I don't know, like it reminds
00:13:09 me of a time when like full metal alchemist, the first one had come out, and everyone was
00:13:13 getting really excited about and watching things on the fucking adult swim and to Nami,
00:13:17 and like there was an emergence of this culture, but now, I don't know, I feel like it's gotten
00:13:22 a little stale.
00:13:23 I mean, there was a time where-
00:13:24 I'm over it.
00:13:25 Yeah, there was a time where you could go to a convention, and like every con, every
00:13:29 anime convention has like screenings of different shows, and you know, there was a time when
00:13:34 they would be screening something that you legitimately couldn't find, you know, like
00:13:39 you did not know where to buy the DVD or the VHS, you didn't know where to stream it or
00:13:44 download it.
00:13:45 Like you could go to a convention and see something that, that like, you know, just
00:13:49 sitting and watching anime could actually be valuable.
00:13:52 And now it's like, there's no, like when you go to those screenings now, they literally
00:13:57 stream them off Crunchyroll, like it's just them playing Crunchyroll on a screen, you
00:14:02 know.
00:14:03 Just thinking about that is hilarious.
00:14:05 Yeah.
00:14:07 Like, even if you were going with your friends, it's like, I could sit with my friends and
00:14:11 watch this at home, and instead I'm watching it in a giant group, and like, there are times
00:14:16 where that can be fun to see an audience react to something, but then there's the other times
00:14:21 where the audience is laughing at the wrong moments, and it like, I get, I'm a fucking
00:14:28 pretentious elitist faggot when it comes to this shit, but I really can't stand being
00:14:33 in a crowd that seems to be getting something very different out of something than what
00:14:37 I'm getting.
00:14:38 Like-
00:14:39 Dude, I totally agree.
00:14:40 I can't stand consuming media with one other person there in the, in the fear that, like
00:14:44 not even that they do it, but in the fear that they'll get it wrong or not be in sync
00:14:48 with me.
00:14:49 Can't stand, if I'm taking it seriously, can't stand it.
00:14:51 Like it was so great when we all watched Mad Bull together at Radcon too, which is like
00:14:56 nine guys screaming the whole time at Mad Bull, and that's very much like what the convention
00:15:01 experience should be at its height, but could you imagine watching that, like watching Mad
00:15:06 Bull with like different people, and you don't know who they are, and they could be, you
00:15:11 know, like, that's a show that a lot of people say is, quote, awesomely bad, or is like a,
00:15:16 a really terrible show, and like imagine if you're in that crowd, the, you know, this
00:15:21 is a, oh, like the title of the panel is, So Bad It's Good, shitty anime that you should
00:15:27 check out, you know, Mad Bull 34.
00:15:30 I promise that's it, like that has happened, Mad Bull has been in those panels, I've seen
00:15:35 it, you know, so like, yeah, that's, that's how I feel in those crowd situations is like,
00:15:42 on the one hand, I love, like my favorite thing, well, one of my favorite things about
00:15:46 conventions is the, like the feeling of these are my people, you know, these are the people
00:15:52 who are watching anime, who I'm talking to online, this is, this is the crowd who gets
00:15:57 what I'm about on some level, but at the same time, they're totally not my people, because
00:16:03 they're, they're walking around dressed as Kirito, you know, and being like, anime is
00:16:08 great, and I'm like, I'm like, Japanese
00:16:12 Japanese
00:16:13 you guys are completely off base, off color, and this is based totally in the fact that
00:16:25 you guys are losers, if you guys, if you guys weren't losers, then you would realize that
00:16:31 cons are great, I can still imagine myself enjoying a con, definitely, well, I would,
00:16:37 I would never call him a loser, I'm, I'm, I'm talking about the other two numbskull
00:16:41 knuckleheads, of course, of course, exhibit, I'm hoping, I'm hoping this year to fly out
00:16:45 to stay with Munchie for anime X though, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, but believe me, I have like
00:16:50 a whole like, like fucking history of every con I've been to, and the ups and downs of
00:16:55 each con, I heard the crinkling of a piece of paper, you said that, you actually wrote
00:16:59 this down, I actually have, anyway, cons are great, because they offer three things, and
00:17:07 by three things, I mean, I'm thinking of one in my head, and once I'm done with that one,
00:17:11 I'll probably have more ideas in my head. Okay, when you, when you get, when you get
00:17:15 your bros, when you get your beefcakes, when you get your, your manly fucking men that
00:17:18 you surround yourself with on a daily basis, you know, the fucking, the, your people, your
00:17:25 stash, your handboys, your handboys, your handboys, when you get them all in the car,
00:17:29 and you go up to some like shitty, like anime, like, like, you all hate anime, not you, but
00:17:34 as in like, like, you and your friends all hate anime, and you go up to an anime convention,
00:17:40 it's fucking great, because you just get to be, be little, ridicule, and antagonize all
00:17:46 of the goers of the con, go to panels, ruin them, you know what you are, Munchy? You're
00:17:51 a fucking Chad, that's who you are, you're a disgusting fucking Chad, I'm just a little
00:17:55 boy trying to make friends, and here you come, with you, we're a bully squad, trying to embarrass
00:18:00 you, one of the things that I love, go fuck yourself, Munchy.
00:18:05 Munchy, have you been to a furry convention, and done that?
00:18:08 Oh my god, no, but that's been, that's been a fucking top billing, dude. Well, I guess
00:18:12 you could, well, I have been to various Brony conventions, so, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:18:18 Is, is, is that why you were at BronyCon? Just to laugh at us?
00:18:21 No, no, no, that was, that was, that was a fucking joke, that was a charade, that was,
00:18:25 that was, that was a meme, that was a jest. I like to go with my friends to conventions,
00:18:30 A, we, we, we, like, like, me and my friends are both in sync, and we know what we would
00:18:35 like, and we'd go to the same panels together, because, you know, we both have an appreciation
00:18:39 for whoever the fuck Japanese retard bitch, whoever's talking, you know, you want to-
00:18:43 I like how this has gone from me and my friends to we, the two of us, have this connection.
00:18:49 You're, it's, it's one totally different feeling from this description mask.
00:18:53 Well, see, well, yes, well, it's, it's one guy, but he changes masks, more often than
00:19:00 you. He plays many roles in the munchy, like, in munch's life.
00:19:03 Cosplayers. You know?
00:19:04 No, no, he, as in, like, one, like, one to two people come, but it's always, like, different
00:19:08 people.
00:19:09 As in he finds victims and he skins them and wears their skin.
00:19:11 As in I kill Native Americans.
00:19:14 What was they fucking, oh yeah, we go there and we all-
00:19:16 Talk about how you like conventions.
00:19:18 Yes, and we all, we appreciate the panels together, and then we go buy merch where
00:19:23 we couldn't buy it anywhere else, or at least I don't know how to. I don't want to use a fucking
00:19:26 computer, it's hard.
00:19:28 I see the one one is a big thing. That's like the one good thing about convinced one time
00:19:32 I literally ask did you how to buy anime because I didn't know how to and then he taught me and then I still didn't know
00:19:40 Did I did I did did you ask me that and then I immediately made that entire 40 minute buyers?
00:19:47 No, no, I asked you like a year after that and then like like while you were teaching me
00:19:52 I Google search like how to buy anime merch then I saw that thumbnail and then I remember that I
00:19:57 Linked you the thumbnail with fire around your eyes and like you glowing like a fucking golden crisp God
00:20:04 Anyway, so you can buy the merchant with you with your meaty your meaty your meaty sockets
00:20:10 And you just have a fucking good time you get to hang out and you get to spend time in an exotic city with exotic sluts
00:20:17 Doing gay shit, and you get to fucking you just look at lots and it's sick
00:20:22 Tell me about the sluts and if I go to a convention are there exotic sluts there? What's what's happening here?
00:20:29 Oh my god, it's Jesse. Oh shit. Okay. I've been here the whole
00:20:36 Jesse did join like ten minutes ago. I wasn't sure if he was like you sound like you're underwater. Yeah, I was gonna say
00:20:42 Yeah, you're like you were just drowned you were drowning in water. Do I are you mouth deep and pussy again, Jesse?
00:20:50 That is a possibility there are many possibilities
00:20:54 The other possibility could be that my microphone is broken from the flood nobody knows everything. Oh my god
00:21:01 Oh god the fucking three hundred dollar one broke. I don't know as you guys are saying I sound underwater. I haven't heard it yet
00:21:08 I don't fucking know nothing. Oh, yeah, it broke in the underwater boy
00:21:12 Either a broker you're just recording through the wrong microphone, which I am an underwater boy
00:21:17 And I have aids and no one can stop me
00:21:20 from having a
00:21:22 right now Jesse yeah
00:21:25 Yes, all right, that's cool. Jesse. You want to talk about your convention actually much you motherfucker. I'm not done
00:21:30 I'm fucking you alive. Wrap it up. You're taking the whole fucking
00:21:34 I'm saying is damn at
00:21:36 At an expo. I'm munchy. Oh my god. Listen buddy. I deserve time. Okay. Hey, it's his catchphrase listen buddy
00:21:45 It's my favorite
00:21:53 Get on the ground you fucking nigger
00:22:02 An expo I got a girl gone. I imagine a sitcom about munchy like he's the Kramer he comes in the door
00:22:10 I and like whatever something weird happens. He looks at the camera and goes get on the ground you
00:22:19 Hired out like a clown to children's parties. Hey kids get on the ground you fucking niggers
00:22:26 Imagine you're watching like like a normal sign-of-the-lip episode and like Jerry's in his apartment
00:22:30 He's talking to George about how he can't get late or something and then like like I burst through the door like Kramer
00:22:34 Like like in my piece of jumpsuit and never just wetter. I'm just get on the ground you fucking diggers
00:22:43 And George would be like I'm getting frustrated by all these racial slurs. I'm not even black
00:22:50 To wrap this up. I like her in the gun. I got a girl in the gun book
00:22:52 I couldn't have got that anywhere else other than a so and it made me happy and I really like it and um, yes, okay
00:22:58 Okay, bye merchandise is cool. That's that's one fun thing
00:23:01 I never would have ever gotten Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix plus if I hadn't seen it well that fateful day
00:23:08 A good like convention piece of merchandise yet. It's about the fucking experience
00:23:14 I guess I've probably spent you by your diamond tiara fucking plushie yet. Yeah, but that was a piece of shit
00:23:19 It was like the one that the cheapest made plushie. She's she's sure I'm a chair is crying right now
00:23:25 She's diamond tiara is so rich. She deserves to be made out of fucking gold
00:23:30 I got the cheapest one because I'm a bitch
00:23:33 I should I couldn't find a better one and that was I've probably lifetime spent like at least five grand on
00:23:41 Merchant conventions
00:23:43 Like that's that's one of the big reasons I go there is to drop a lot of money
00:23:47 I spent more money there than anywhere else, but I was never that big of a spender on that kind of stuff anyway
00:23:52 I go to conventions to spend money and kill people. Yeah a huge part of
00:23:58 Why I went to Otacon so many times is that it happens to almost always fall directly on my birthday
00:24:04 Which is August 8th and so my dad would usually like you know like he'd he'd you know
00:24:10 Buy me the trip to Otacon and give me a bunch of spending money, and I just blow through it all there
00:24:15 Oh, yeah, so so it's like a big birthday thing for me
00:24:19 That's where I got a lot of my figures a lot of my posters a lot of my art books and just a bunch of other shit
00:24:27 All of which I regret none of this none of that money should ever have been spent
00:24:34 With me is at the moment is like I don't have any like huge
00:24:38 Like desire to own things about a thing like even though my little pony wasn't that great
00:24:43 I have a lunar plushie, but that was like a gift
00:24:46 So you know that's great, but like I wouldn't buy a lot of brony stuff
00:24:50 The only thing I would buy is like home stuck but home sucks dead and no one will make any home
00:24:55 Suck art not an animax bro. Not an animax, bro X bro
00:25:00 There's so much home stuck shit there. I was in my boggles my mind. Oh shit. Well, I gotta go there then
00:25:05 I gotta go. There's this one risk. There's this one brisket cosplayer that was just like
00:25:09 Oh
00:25:11 Is that
00:25:13 Attraction is that what that's I like it
00:25:16 Yeah, you know when you start to foam at the mouth and also foam at your penis
00:25:20 Yes, yes, I do you've all you've all kind of covered my my main reasons for going to conventions
00:25:26 But I want to summarize them like that that there's pretty much three big ones and then a fourth one that applies to me and you guys to some extent
00:25:34 Well, to the same extent really but anyways
00:25:38 The first big reason is you know being around your people to whatever whatever
00:25:43 Ills or games that may entail and for me the best like the ultimate being around my people thing
00:25:49 Cuz like, you know out in the convention halls. I don't care man. It's just a bunch of fucking, you know
00:25:54 People I don't want to talk to you know in the panels. I don't care
00:25:58 But there's one place I go at Otsa Khan every year and I spend hours there
00:26:02 Which is Otsa karaoke?
00:26:04 I hang out in the karaoke room all day and just listen to people
00:26:09 Attempt to sing anime songs and that's when I truly feel at home because you have to have a certain level of
00:26:18 Like passion to want to do it. It's to an audience of nobody. There's only like ten people who hang out in there
00:26:25 There's a bunch of regulars who every year. It's the same few people singing there
00:26:30 You know singing the songs
00:26:32 You're getting up every year and I recognize all of them though. I don't talk to them. We communicate only through song
00:26:38 That's not entirely true. I do I I trade a few words, but I you know
00:26:42 I don't like fucking buddy up with them or anything
00:26:44 They're they're often cosplaying and stuff
00:26:47 I mean you're gonna hear the fucking every song from Inuyasha a thousand times and you're gonna hear a bunch of the same songs every year
00:26:54 What it's always interesting to hear
00:26:56 God bless
00:26:58 You know that Haruhi one not a lot of that not a lot of not a lot of God knows
00:27:03 I would be the one probably to go up and sing that
00:27:06 I do that one. That's a classic, but
00:27:08 But it's always interesting to see which song is the big one that year like this past year. It was all JoJo, you know
00:27:15 JoJo so big is that a JoJo reference?
00:27:18 What indeed
00:27:29 Anyways, yeah, I always hang out there. That's my best like connecting with the nerds place. Then there's the merchandise which
00:27:37 Was a lot more impressive when I was younger because Otakan has a merch room
00:27:42 that's the size of a fucking aircraft hangar and
00:27:45 And and you know, it's it the first year I went there
00:27:50 I legitimately got lost for like an hour and just was exploring this wonderland of anime crap
00:27:55 I have returned. I left the call
00:27:59 Welcome back bloody dead man
00:28:03 Oh, no bloody dead man's gonna bloody kill us. I left to increase my age. That's Babadook spook
00:28:09 This is just me. This is just my voice now
00:28:16 I'm just a broken man
00:28:18 Bloody dead man has like a British accent. That's true. What he dead man is the father of under Taylor
00:28:31 I thought I told you that I disowned you you're not my family anymore
00:28:36 Oh
00:28:44 You're a disgrace to the dead man family name because you're you're weird and just slightly a different way than me
00:28:52 This it makes total sense like the bloody dead man disowned his son because he liked undertale too much and now
00:28:57 Sansa is a surrogate father. He's like he's perverted in just slightly the wrong way, and I don't want him anymore
00:29:05 And I never had a father figure. That's why I want to suck your weirest of my own fathers
00:29:11 They're sending you little and great. I've tried to suck mini a lemon pipe in my day
00:29:16 And when I do it I bite him because I'm kind of a vampire maybe or something. I don't know
00:29:22 Dad it's not my fault the bot flies choose me. They chose me. I didn't choose the bot fly lifestyle
00:29:29 Listen the last bot fly that I was in a committed relationship with was your mother and she was a vampire bot fly
00:29:36 Oh my god, his mother was a bot fly
00:29:41 You think bot flies had
00:29:43 After these vampire bot flies they get inside your lemon pipe and they turn it into a kool-aid pipe
00:29:49 They turn you into a bloody dead man
00:29:52 They turn you into a fucking ruddy leaky bloody dead man cock is what I've done for god damn dead boy
00:29:59 No
00:30:02 Does anyone else fuck you son?
00:30:04 No dad you're gay. Do you stop?
00:30:08 Some have called me that. Many have called me that in my 5000 years on this earth gay
00:30:13 But it's only one of the many things I am
00:30:17 Bitch, I'm on a crest to save sense and told me to kill all the gay people and I'll have to kill you
00:30:23 That's what I've talked to you. I haven't talked to in 16 years, but now I'm finished if I
00:30:30 Years is but a blink of an eye to me. I've been here since before the dawn of time
00:30:35 I only went down to the store to get a pack of cigarettes
00:30:38 I was going to come back one of these centuries. I swear
00:30:42 Lend me strength so I can kill my bitch dad. There's no such thing as sense and I hate my son. Fuck you
00:30:50 You're just gay
00:30:53 Oh, no, they left. Where'd they go? Oh, they're gone
00:30:56 Oh, it's
00:30:58 What lore what adventures we have here in the procrastinator's podcast
00:31:01 You know what? You know what we could the amount of characters that we have in the pcp
00:31:05 We could we could all cosplay them and go to a convention. Oh my god. I mean this there's even yeah
00:31:11 I'm gonna cosplay the undertaler my son. You should. Oh, does that mean I'm the bloody dead man? Oh, shit
00:31:19 Yes, I'm like the young years. You know like the once learn that like the laurax movie
00:31:23 I'm like that version of the bloody dead man. Oh, like the young like that makes sense. That makes sense
00:31:29 Yeah, one she the twink
00:31:32 But she's a fucking six foot one
00:31:36 230 pound twink well well compared to the bloody dead man who is like the like like the the opposite of a twink
00:31:42 Like the polar opposite that makes sense. What are we talking? What's the plot? Oh, oh, oh, this is this is the pcp lore podcast, right?
00:31:53 Hey, uh, here's the thing that I wanted to mention
00:31:57 Uh
00:31:58 One thing that I like about convention or rather okay, so now I don't care about this at all
00:32:03 But when I was young this was something that I was very interested in so I talked before about you know
00:32:08 How you should talk almano was going to convention that was cool
00:32:10 But before that when I was even younger I got excited because I still cared about uh voice actors
00:32:16 And uh, I used to go that that's my number my number three. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay. Well here take it away
00:32:22 Go ahead. Oh, well, I'll just finish my number two point first. Yeah about the merch
00:32:27 Because the merch was such an such an ocean of of possibilities when I was young
00:32:32 Um, and then I realized by like the second or third year that they all sell the same shit
00:32:37 Every fucking booth is the same shit and it's only like the most popular shows that have any merch
00:32:42 Um, and they just they never have anything I want
00:32:46 So I'll wander around for like hours in this fucking endless sea of merch and walk away with one thing
00:32:54 That was like, you know what the thing is, you know, what the thing is
00:32:56 Uh, a con is inversely proportional as in the more
00:33:01 It's your the what you will get out of going to a con is inversely proportional to how much you already know about like anime culture
00:33:08 That's the more you learn the less you get out of it. I just absolutely agree with that
00:33:13 that because
00:33:14 Another part of the appeal when we talk about panels
00:33:17 Is that uh, you learn a lot like for me in the early days one of the coolest things about conventions was I would go to a panel
00:33:24 About something I'd never heard of and then learn like all this interesting amazing shit about it
00:33:30 Uh, and now I know everything like there has not been a panel in the last few years that the ones I started going to
00:33:37 Uh
00:33:38 Instead of going to like ones about anime now
00:33:40 I go to all the like weird japanese culture like like a panel about noodles or something
00:33:44 Just so I can have something new that I don't know about because any anime panel you've reached
00:33:49 You've reached weeb bedrock at this point and it's just there are directly diagonal to bedroom bed. Yeah, it's actually the same place
00:33:58 but uh
00:34:00 There's been like a ton of panels that I go to and not only do I feel like I could give the panel
00:34:05 But I feel like I could give it better like half the time. Oh, you know calling you out con panel holders
00:34:11 And I mean I've run on the universe. That's right
00:34:14 but
00:34:15 But um, but yeah, so with the with the the shit like last this past otacon
00:34:19 I literally went there with the intention of sparing no expense
00:34:23 I was like i'm going to spend as much money as I can
00:34:26 And I will buy anything that interests me and I still there was nothing like I came away with like a few posters
00:34:33 And that was about it. Um, so yeah, it's
00:34:37 That aspect is kind of dead to me now and then again with the panels, you know, there's too much stuff
00:34:41 I already know. Um, and it used to be that one of the coolest things that you can meet
00:34:46 Japanese guests because yeah, wait, wait, wait before we get into that just about that topic
00:34:50 I wanted to share one just small anecdote about this whole things you can learn when you go to convention
00:34:56 I have to admit my first visit to a convention was definitely
00:35:00 I want to say almost definitely worth
00:35:02 Going because I remember this was when I had gotten into one piece in a big way off of the four kids dub
00:35:09 And so I was there in my full luffy costume with my big captain's coat
00:35:12 That I still wear my my gur and login one is I I don't know if I've ever mentioned this
00:35:16 But like the gur and login coat I wear is a is just my one piece coat
00:35:20 I made way back in the day just with the gur and login thing sewn onto the back. There's there's some lore for you
00:35:26 but um
00:35:27 When I was there, uh, uh, like I happened upon another cosplayer a zoro cosplayer
00:35:33 And this exchange would come to define my life for decades to come
00:35:37 Because what he told me what he said to me
00:35:39 He walked up to me or we were taking a picture and like we he got into it with us or something
00:35:43 Because it was me ben and like a friend. We were all cosplaying one piece. This guy joined his zoro
00:35:48 And so he uh, after we took the picture a ben was sanju sanju
00:35:53 He's a big sanju fan or at least was um
00:35:57 But uh, so this guy like I
00:36:00 You know, I had watched the whole show up to that point that was aired and I thought it was great
00:36:03 And this guy just looks at me and he's like, hey dude, nice costume. Like yeah, you too
00:36:07 Of course at this time I was young and timid and was just like, yeah, thanks. And um, he uh, he just said so like what's
00:36:14 So, uh, what's your favorite part and I'm like, oh, I don't know
00:36:17 I liked when they fought like captain coro like something like that and he just says yeah, that's pretty cool. Uh, how'd you like skypea?
00:36:23 and
00:36:24 Skypea had not been aired. Skypea would never air. I don't think at this point
00:36:29 Yeah, like basically what happened here was that he introduced the concept of manga to me
00:36:35 And I was I had no idea that one piece was even based on a manga or that I was behind
00:36:40 And the shame the deep shame that blossomed in me at that moment of not knowing
00:36:45 I thought I knew everything there was to know at this point
00:36:48 And then I learned there was a whole universe beyond my reach and on that day
00:36:52 I vowed to never allow someone else to have more knowledge of something I like than me
00:36:57 What I would what I would give to have been that man
00:37:01 Yeah
00:37:02 He he would man. Oh, because I found out about one piece through the manga before the anime even debuted in America
00:37:08 Um, I'm a true fucking patrician. Yes, you are. You know, anyway, uh
00:37:14 Yeah, I'll never forget you zero cosplayer. You're a legend like wherever you are out there, buddy
00:37:19 If uh, if you're uh, unless you're gonna like talk with like number three or number four
00:37:24 I don't know what you're gonna say to you, but
00:37:26 Well, yeah, I'm gonna go into number three
00:37:29 Unless you want to continue or whatever you want. Well, I was gonna I was gonna sort of change gears, but I'll do it after
00:37:34 Let's finish these examples that will yeah. Um, well
00:37:38 So to to to broach the subject of number three
00:37:40 I just want to talk about that first con I went to the first ozakan and why it was so magical that day
00:37:46 Because it happened the first day of the con was on my birthday. I was turning. I think 17 and uh, you know, it was
00:37:55 Everything about it was the craziest shit I'd ever seen. There's more people than I'd ever seen in one place
00:37:59 I'd never seen cosplay, you know, so that was
00:38:02 Magical and now it means nothing to me. I've seen every cosplay
00:38:06 The only thing I get out of cosplay now is seeing what is the most popular show to cosplay that year is always interesting
00:38:12 Um, like, you know, recently was like tokyo ghoul is like the big one. Anyway
00:38:17 Um, I'm seeing all this fucking cosplay all this stuff and everything all these people
00:38:21 But the thing that truly made this concert this uh, this con experience was that they were having a concert
00:38:28 Um with jam project whom all of you have probably heard at least one jam project song
00:38:33 They did the one punch man opening most famously recently. Um, is that what they're most famous for? Okay. Well, yeah
00:38:41 Everyone knows the one punch man opening so I can easily give that as an example
00:38:45 Um, oh and you know members of it did the one piece opening and the dragon ball z opening
00:38:50 So, you know, they performed those at this show
00:38:53 um, but
00:38:55 The japanese ones of course not the fucking yoyo yoyo, but
00:38:59 jam project
00:39:01 Is a five person it's like five singers who are all famous for anime music
00:39:05 And they have a super group and they mostly do like robot shows
00:39:08 But anyways, they were they were doing a show
00:39:11 On my birthday at otsukan, you know and I went to this show and they fucking, you know, they they sing all these incredible songs
00:39:18 And for their encore they sang the op to the soul taker
00:39:22 Which is my favorite anime opening of all time that I'd you know that I'd sang like
00:39:28 The the opening the opening lines of the soul taker is this woman singing like
00:39:37 It's like this like epic rise up and me and my brother would like sing that when we were like
00:39:41 Unboxing like it's like a new piece of equipment or something like, you know real autism shit
00:39:47 So I they they played that song. It was the the greatest thing I'd ever seen in my life
00:39:52 You know cool band my favorite anime op on my birthday at this convention. Everything was magical
00:39:57 I spent all this money and I saw all these japanese guests, you know, I met like
00:40:01 Well, I didn't go to any meet and greets. I didn't actually do that till this past year, but like
00:40:05 Um, you know, I got to see these people talk about the anime industry and I learned all this stuff and over time
00:40:12 All of that like has gotten lesser
00:40:15 There's like, you know, ozakan has fewer and fewer japanese guests because they all go to anime expo now because anime expo is way bigger
00:40:21 Um, you know, there there hasn't been these magical panels where I learned things there hasn't been these epic encounters
00:40:28 There hasn't been you know a beautiful moment on my birthday
00:40:31 It's like every year I get more jaded and more cynical and more and more like why am I even
00:40:36 Going to this anymore and like last year was the last year they were doing it in baltimore. They're moving it to dc
00:40:41 I was almost I wasn't gonna go to ozakan this year, but now they've announced they're actually bringing back jam project
00:40:48 So now I totally want to go um, but man, that's great
00:40:51 Yeah, but like it was definitely like this downward spiral and now I want to go to anime expo to see if
00:40:57 See if it can reignite the spark because it's it's now like twice the size ozakan ever was
00:41:04 And has all these great japanese guests and shit and uh, I could hang out with munchie though
00:41:08 We'll probably just split up because of her ways because he won't know anything I want to go to
00:41:14 Uh, no, I I mean I hate anime so no matter what I do
00:41:18 I wouldn't be happy like actually paying attention to it. So I might as well just make myself like miserable
00:41:23 Because it'll be funny
00:41:25 Oh, and I hinted earlier there was a fourth reason to go to conventions that only applies to me and and us
00:41:31 Which is to run panels to to be a part of the convention whole different world
00:41:36 It's like a whole different flip side of the coin where it's it's really about
00:41:41 This epic moment of showmanship because it's it's one thing to like, you know run a youtube show and you could see
00:41:48 Oh, I have 250,000 subscribers. I have comments and stuff like that
00:41:51 But when you actually see like a thousand people sitting in front of you listening to you laughing at your stupid jokes
00:41:59 Then it's like that's when you really realize like I am a wizard god like I control people, you know
00:42:05 I wasn't I I don't know whether I liked it when I was up there with the brony con stuff
00:42:10 I mean for one thing I embarrassed myself by swearing too much when I shouldn't
00:42:14 That was hilarious. It's fine. I guess it was funny, but I felt like oh no
00:42:18 Oh, no, I'm doing wrong things. I was hey at least you weren't the one who when we did the concert where we
00:42:25 For anyone fucking punched celestia in the goddamn face you fucking drunk
00:42:35 No, I wasn't even gonna bring up that. I don't think I actually like hit her dude
00:42:39 You watched if you were close to her face, dude, you were real
00:42:44 It's my birthday
00:42:46 It's my birthday
00:42:48 If you if you watch the footage that hippo has of otacon, you'll see that we we got to we
00:42:53 They were having a big concert and we for whatever reason were like the djs who went up in between songs and like and or in between sets
00:43:01 And announced it and I believe that the very first thing I did was like to run on stage and be like what the fuck's up
00:43:10 The lady running it was immediately like I've made a huge mistake
00:43:14 Because I was yet she kept us going for the whole two hours or whatever the fuck it was
00:43:18 Well, they eventually took the mic away from me. They wouldn't let me uh like everyone else went on and did like the dj thing
00:43:24 And I went up there with a roll of toilet paper. It was just throwing it in the background
00:43:31 She gave me the mic and it was like you're the responsible one hold on to this mic and make sure they don't do anything crazy
00:43:36 From my perspective that was it was it was terrible at the time because I wasn't drunk and I was like, oh no
00:43:43 Yeah, everyone's having a good time and I'm just sitting here being gay
00:43:46 But watching the footage it was great, you know, even though when I went up on stage
00:43:50 I didn't know what to do. I was just standing in the middle of the stage for like five seconds
00:43:53 Not really doing anything. I didn't have a mic. I didn't know what to do. So I was like, uh, here I am
00:43:57 I'm definitely a little embarrassed. I'm pretty sure I had the most fun I've ever had in my life at that
00:44:03 concert
00:44:04 Yeah, I mean looking back on it like remember when uh, there was that one part where like everyone backstage like all went out and
00:44:10 Started dancing all together. Yeah, and we were just it was we were all fucking going nuts. It was it was crazy and uh,
00:44:18 I don't know that that was awesome. I definitely
00:44:20 Was embarrassing myself and looking at it now actually not now, but when I first watched it back
00:44:25 I was like, oh god, I will never be okay with this
00:44:27 But at this point now, I'm totally comfortable with it and it just is just a music
00:44:31 Digi the image of you being completely like like drunk like not even be able to like recognize your surroundings
00:44:39 Being sang to by nicole oliver. You are my sunshine
00:44:43 It was tearing at like nothing. It was the weirdest
00:44:48 Fucking thing because no one warned me. No one gave me stage directions or told me what was going on
00:44:53 I just all of a sudden have like a you know a I don't know if she's a famous voice actress per se, but you know
00:45:01 She is for in the context of this convention essentially a literal goddess, you know, that's true
00:45:07 Um putting here and I remember
00:45:10 Having this moment where I felt really bad because of the fact that I didn't care about my little pony anymore
00:45:15 Like oh, yeah, like I felt it was like if this had happened two years prior
00:45:20 I would be like crying, you know, like this would be so meaningful to me and instead i'm up here
00:45:26 obliterated shit
00:45:28 With like I don't care about anyone in this place at all
00:45:32 I have like, you know, I'm out here because it's fun for me to be a drunken idiot not because I actually care about this crowd
00:45:38 um
00:45:39 And like their goddess is singing to me for my birthday and I was just like this is wrong
00:45:44 I am a bad man your god to me is just another slut and it's my birthday
00:45:54 What's that what is that clip I said that somewhere right? I don't know
00:45:57 It's it's it's when we're all walking to the thing and victor or maybe I was holding no it was victor holding the camera
00:46:04 Watching you be drunk and punching natin and stuff and then yeah, yeah
00:46:09 Uh victor comments that I wish I was as drunk as you is like it's my birthday, bitch, and I just
00:46:16 onto the part where you almost
00:46:20 When you were pretending to fight jesse
00:46:23 That was one of the funniest edits i've ever seen in my life
00:46:26 That was the funniest the best part about that was her fucking face like she real like I just sang to this person
00:46:32 I just sang like you're my sunshine to this person and now they're like fighting
00:46:39 You changed her whole view of the human race and what to expect when you know like good things are always
00:46:44 When I watched that footage I got the impression that she realized what was like like that she you know
00:46:49 She was scared to try to get out of the way, but she realized that this was a drunken insane party and that
00:46:54 Like oh, yeah, you know these are I actually remember seeing her backstage just thinking oh, what's going on up there?
00:47:00 Is like is is someone getting a birthday like I was backstage looking at I was like that
00:47:04 Is that who I don't know who that is, but I think it's someone
00:47:07 I mean let's she went and did that. It's just so weird. Let's be real the brony community
00:47:12 There's a lot of infantilization in there right like the idea of the character princess celestia singing to you
00:47:20 Is like oh, you're like you're my child, you know, you're all my children kind of thing
00:47:25 It's like but in that moment. I think she remembered. Oh, yeah, this is like a drunken 23 year old man
00:47:29 When you started swinging. Yes, I think this is a grown bearded fat dangerous man
00:47:37 And dangerous
00:47:39 That should be the name of your biography fat and dangerous
00:47:43 Gayer than god is the name of my biography. Okay. All right. Fine. Fine. But fat and dangerous would be the sequel
00:47:50 It goes it goes dead and gay and then
00:47:53 Dead and gay right and then gay and god. I think it will be the finale
00:47:57 I was already planning to make a gayer than god song for the gay and dead album
00:48:01 But I I think I'll also make fat and dangerous a song
00:48:04 It'll be like a big fat like fucking
00:48:07 Atlanta style heavy beat like killer mic song. It's gonna be one of the samples is it's my birthday
00:48:14 Yeah, that should definitely be one of all I should definitely be one
00:48:18 Oh my god. Yes
00:48:21 So, okay, so I think it's fair to say that if you're on the side of
00:48:25 Like of of making or being you know the one up on stage doing things at cons that changes the game and it's pretty fun
00:48:31 Most of the time it's pretty fun if you're if you're used to it
00:48:34 I was so overwhelmed like in the panel and on the thing that I kind of hated it at the end
00:48:38 Well, you know like that was only your like second convention though
00:48:41 So like you were probably still acclimating in general and then going up on stage is just like another big change, you know
00:48:46 So also, I think I think personally you should give us more tracks. We all had
00:48:51 The group
00:48:53 I did to shit through that whole panel. I forgot about the group shit. Oh my god
00:48:58 Literally all of us. Yeah, we we we ate wendy's on our way to the convention and we were like fucking late
00:49:04 Like we almost missed our own panel which had all of us on it because we like woke up late
00:49:10 And then we went to wendy's and they took forever and we ate and it was like totally all of us felt shit
00:49:15 And uh, so we second we got to the convention
00:49:18 We went to the bathrooms like right by the you know right by where the the panel was gonna be and we like all
00:49:24 Simultaneously took a shit. I forgot about the group shit
00:49:28 Oh my god. Yes. That was the best thing that ever happened. I was so I was so conscious of my point
00:49:34 I didn't want to poop my pants on stage as well as
00:49:39 Well, yeah, I mean munchy that by that point by by this brony con I went to three of them
00:49:45 And by that one literally the only reason any of us was there was to hang out with one another
00:49:51 Yeah, yeah, which is why rad rad con happened because it was like after
00:49:56 You know after going to brony con it's like we're really here to hang out with each other and to try to get laid
00:50:01 Um, I think
00:50:02 Yeah, the main reason we went to brony con that that year that I was there is because I hadn't been to one yet
00:50:06 And I wanted yeah to go. Oh, yeah, that's that was a big thing before it was totally over
00:50:10 Yeah, and while you were still like someone with like clout in the community who could enjoy being famous kp
00:50:16 kp is like the top billing guests. I really want to see here. Oh, yeah, dog. Oh, yeah
00:50:21 Uh, that's what conventions are. They're just locations for play dates
00:50:26 And that's why they're incredible. They are incredible play date material
00:50:30 They're like theme parks, but I but wouldn't you say munchy that it was even better at rad con than like
00:50:36 Them brony con. I would say it was better
00:50:39 However, I don't like like just the fact that it was better doesn't mean that I wouldn't I wouldn't also cherish going to a convention
00:50:46 It's not it's I'm not saying that hanging out with your friends is inherently like
00:50:51 Like better or worse with the convention, but do you think it's an interesting location and it breeds a lot of discussion
00:50:58 And uh, like like it's easy to ridicule people and therefore very funny
00:51:04 Yeah, it is a definite like different because like in digi's house
00:51:09 Some people have rooms that they go to when they're not, you know doing something with the rest of us
00:51:14 And so like in a convention, you know, you're you're always having to do something other just sitting around talking or
00:51:20 Or like going to a panel or just eating, you know, it's just everyone's doing something at the same time
00:51:25 Panels are the fucking worst thing but like what I mean is everyone's doing something at the same time
00:51:29 It's a different sort of feeling than just being in a house together
00:51:32 Yeah, because you know people wake up at different times and sleeping arrangements are kind of rough. Yeah. Well, I mean for sure
00:51:38 It's the the thing about conventions and the reason that I wanted like well aside from the fact that I just want to hang out with
00:51:44 You guys and make stuff. Um, the other thing I don't like about conventions is
00:51:49 Uh, it's hard enough living in one house with everybody. It's even worse when you're all in one room
00:51:55 And it's like yeah, like for me. I have terrible insomnia and I
00:52:01 And I also can't stand silence. So I'm used to you know going to bed playing music
00:52:06 You know having like a certain certain way
00:52:09 Jacking off you can't jack off and you're all in the same hotel room big problem. That's what you think amateur
00:52:15 Well, you know, you can take a long shower, but uh
00:52:18 It's harder to get we'll say it's hard to get away with jacking off
00:52:22 When you're all sharing a room, but um, you know for me every convention I've ever been to
00:52:28 By four in the morning
00:52:29 I'm going to be stepping over everybody to get out of the room and then just wandering the hotel for like hours
00:52:34 And then I'll probably sleep for 30 minutes and then go to the con, you know
00:52:38 And and be like miserable and sick all day. So, you know, that's that's like as many like there's
00:52:45 All the cons are worth having gone to
00:52:48 Like it's worth it to be able to tell these great stories and to be able to say have all these fond memories
00:52:54 But the actual experience of living it is often hellish because it's always like no sleep
00:53:01 Very difficult to remain uh to keep up your hygiene at all, you know
00:53:05 Which is is actually a problem when you're in baltimore in the summer and it's fucking 95 degrees and you're walking all day
00:53:13 you know, so like
00:53:15 Usually by the end of a convention, I am physically broken like my voice doesn't work anymore. I can't see
00:53:22 I'm like sleeping. I usually sleep for like almost a whole 24 hours the day after a con
00:53:28 Um, so yeah, it like there's a lot of nightmarish elements that make it that that are like why I wouldn't just like like
00:53:36 Even if otacon wasn't that great, you know, um, it would it would still be worth going to right because why not?
00:53:42 It's something to do for a weekend
00:53:44 Except that it's something that involves like a four-hour car car drive, which isn't that bad
00:53:50 But then they're sharing a hotel with a bunch of other people not getting any sleep physically exhausting yourself, you know
00:53:56 And then the existential ennui of realizing that you've put yourself through all of this and for what, you know
00:54:03 That's what gets me the most. I always end up like by sunday. I feel like I hate the world at most conventions
00:54:09 So, yeah, it's fun. I've had that at the end of radcon. Well, that was physically
00:54:14 I felt like that through all of radcon
00:54:17 But radcon 2 was for totally different reasons. Um that I felt that way I understand what you mean and I appreciate it
00:54:24 However, uh, I think it's wrong and I think you're gay. Uh
00:54:27 I I I
00:54:29 One way to put it is that radcon 2 was like if we went to a convention and we ran every panel
00:54:34 That's that's how I describe radcon 2
00:54:38 Uh, I mean, uh, it is exhausting. However, like I I don't feel pain in the sense that like
00:54:45 Like you don't feel pain at all pain is like really funny to me and like like whenever I get hit by it
00:54:50 I just like dude like dude
00:54:53 And and uh, like like I like I'm literally here is a like like
00:55:00 This is like a like a part of my life that you need to understand to get me
00:55:05 Uh, and I I will I will title this chapter of my life. Seinfeld was like a mindbreak dosion for real life
00:55:14 Yeah, I'm I'm always thinking about my life as if I was a character on Seinfeld
00:55:20 And so every bad thing that humanly happens to me. I just think that's really fucking funny. That's sick
00:55:25 That's that's that's amazing because victor does the exact same thing but with curb your enthusiasm as opposed to side
00:55:32 You know, that that's the ironic age relivering. We're living in now where our own suffering is merely an amusing fact of uh, you know
00:55:40 I think again, it's easy for me to see it that way in retrospect, but in the moment. It's just like I do in the moment
00:55:46 Yeah, um
00:55:48 But you just got a faster processor for this shit
00:55:52 Because I got a mindbreak dosioned
00:55:54 I wanted to talk about this for a while
00:55:57 Uh, you've been talking about anime cons and and brony con. I don't know whether any of you've gone to like a video game
00:56:04 Convention like just for video games. No, I have not I would say this
00:56:10 But I kind of wish jeff was here because he has gone to all of those
00:56:13 Oh
00:56:16 You know, uh, and he could we could talk about that because like I don't think they're that different though that he wants us to go
00:56:22 To to magfest. I kind of would like to go like to magfest or packs or something because like from what I've learned
00:56:27 From watching like
00:56:29 You know youtube content people who are video game ish
00:56:32 Like total biscuit and jontron or whatever game gross
00:56:35 They it's a different sort of feeling because it's not like I don't know
00:56:39 I feel like I I would have more fun at one of those perhaps
00:56:42 But maybe not I'm just not I'm skeptical that there's much difference really
00:56:46 Yeah, I don't know because I haven't been to a game. There's there's someone who's been to like a shitload of uh otakans
00:56:51 Like there's off. There is a huge contingent of gaming there
00:56:56 Like otakans is really an everything convention. It's not really about anime per se if you go there as just a gamer
00:57:02 There there's a huge arcade room
00:57:04 There's people who just hang out in there and play street fighter the whole convention
00:57:08 You know they have gaming tournaments
00:57:10 Even brony con had like smash tournaments and shit. Um, yeah, that's what i'm saying
00:57:14 It's I remember there was a guy who was like wider than he was tall playing smash. That's all I remember
00:57:20 And uh, it was in there just sort of yeah, I think victor competed in that actually and um, yes
00:57:28 There's a pretty big there's a pretty big arcade room
00:57:30 I personally I I never have the patience to like wait to be able to play one of the games
00:57:35 The only time I the only time I was excited enough about a video game
00:57:38 They had because they they they don't have like a lot of really cool interesting arcade cabinets at otakon
00:57:44 Unfortunately, and that's I would like to go to a gaming convention if they had like an like a legit arcade
00:57:49 Like if they had games that I really had, you know heard of and spoken in soft whispers and always wanted to see
00:57:55 The only time I got really excited was when they had dengeki bunko fighting climax
00:57:59 Which had not come out yet in the us
00:58:00 Which is the game where you fight like novel characters and get to beat up kirito and shit
00:58:05 Except that there was this fucking guy at the like, you know, they had two cabinets
00:58:10 So everyone was fighting each other and there was this dude there who was playing kirito and had obviously played the game
00:58:16 Like he had it
00:58:17 He must have had the japanese version on vita and was just destroying everyone
00:58:21 But he would never
00:58:22 Move like, you know, he was just like taking each new challenger and kicking their asses and everyone was dead silent
00:58:28 Because like the the atmosphere this guy gave off was like a total douchebag asshole
00:58:32 Who was like here to beat people to prove that he's so good at this game that none of us have ever played
00:58:37 Because it's not out in america specifically. Yeah, just at this
00:58:41 And so there's probably like six people and we're all we're each like moving through the line
00:58:45 And each person will like get up fight him lose and then just silently walk away and the next person goes up
00:58:51 Why don't anyone make this guy fucking move?
00:58:53 Just because you know
00:58:55 You lose the match and you walk away and it was like it was new people coming up
00:58:59 You know like nobody was like hanging out around the machine. It was just like people were you know, all right
00:59:03 that's fine lining up to play and
00:59:05 Realizing this guy
00:59:06 But I was there long enough to see that he had you know beaten down all these people and of course
00:59:10 I tried and I got my ass kicked because he knew the like the auto combo
00:59:13 You know, he wasn't even like great at the game
00:59:15 It's just he had played the fucking thing and I was so mad at that guy. I literally wanted him dead
00:59:22 I was like I will train at this game for the rest of my life just so I could beat this guy and rub it in his face
00:59:28 You know, um
00:59:30 I'd like to see your uh oreimo against his uh, I assume he was a kirito player. I just yeah, he was playing kirito
00:59:36 How did I know how did I know I said it but uh, well, that's how I knew
00:59:41 but
00:59:42 I was at the time I I had tried playing shana because I shana was gonna be my main
00:59:47 I wanted her to be like the one I would play in the game, uh, but I ended up being good with uh, what's kirino?
00:59:54 anyways, um
00:59:55 Yeah, like so I haven't hung out in the gaming room much
00:59:58 But I I I do kind of want to go to magfest not so much for the gaming
01:00:01 But because it's specifically a gaming and music convention
01:00:05 Like there's it's more about like nerdcore bands and shit playing. I'm sure uh Tupperware remix parties probably played there
01:00:13 Protoman plays there. Yeah, they have and I want to see them there one time. Yeah, I just got back
01:00:20 Yeah, like
01:00:22 I don't know. I wouldn't have been like unwilling to go to magfest
01:00:25 But jeff wanted us to go to that and radcon and I was like we can't
01:00:30 Radcon's an event for making things and there's like a schedule for it
01:00:34 And we cannot afford to go to that and magfest, you know, I kind of would like to go
01:00:40 At some point with jeff and all
01:00:42 Just as a big old procrastinators magfest
01:00:46 Yeah, it would be fun. That could be cool. It's just affording it
01:00:48 Maybe he could he could be the guy to introduce us to I don't know fucking
01:00:52 Everybody's super buddy hop. I hate all of those
01:00:56 I don't I don't dislike them. I would be I'd be happy to just see. Oh, yeah
01:01:01 I mean, it's just that it's just not my crowd right now. You know, I mean, maybe it could be
01:01:07 I mean, I just didn't know anything about it. I'd certainly like to meet buddy hop. He's cool. But anyway, uh
01:01:13 Yeah, but
01:01:15 Oh, yeah, so I do I do agree though that
01:01:18 Gaming conventions seem different going by because there's a lot more gaming like there's more hands on
01:01:26 There it is it's it's more of like, you know, you're going there more to do something as opposed like with an anime convention
01:01:33 You know, if you go to all these panels that are like the informative ones again
01:01:36 Like if you already know the stuff, it's completely useless, you know
01:01:39 Like you might get to meet some cool industry people but at a video game convention
01:01:43 There's often actually a game there that you could not play elsewhere that and that's interesting
01:01:49 You know, that's probably what I'd want to go for the most
01:01:52 But I doubt they're that different from anime cons, you know, I'm ready to make a sweeping proclamation about
01:01:59 The function of conventions and and what they should be used for and what purpose they serve
01:02:05 Conventions are something that children should go to
01:02:09 Yeah, they are they are best for for young adults like, you know, 12 13 that that sort of range
01:02:16 And they're just gonna you're gonna get less out of them as you get older
01:02:19 And I'll tell you why and if you go with friends and you just tool around then that you can go at any age
01:02:23 That that'll be fine
01:02:24 But the usefulness of the actual thing is best for the young and I'll tell you why
01:02:28 It's because I mean there's this thing I said before of just the more you know about the subject matter
01:02:33 The less you get out of it and and that really applies in a lot of ways
01:02:36 Like when I was when I was young one of the first panels
01:02:39 I went to at some convention and this blew my mind
01:02:42 This is like one of the first sort of analytical lectures I ever heard about
01:02:46 Anime or in this case a video game
01:02:48 It was a lecture that some dude was giving on how like teetus from final fantasy 10 represented the
01:02:55 The like the human ideal of the ubermensch and like his role in final fantasy 10 was like a representation of like the ideal man in a
01:03:03 Like a fantasy world or like some bullshit like that
01:03:06 But I had never heard any talk like that before which is now a format that's kind of you know people talk about that show on youtube now
01:03:13 But at the time I'd never heard anything like that
01:03:15 Um, but other than that there are the there's like so there's that little bit of information you can gain
01:03:20 But then there's the distinct like magical moment factor like when me and ben were young
01:03:26 Um, and I think this was even more important for ben or more enjoyable for ben than was for me
01:03:31 When we were young at anime boston the pillows played and it was one of the most
01:03:36 Awesome things we'd ever seen our lives and and in addition to just hearing all the songs and being completely blown away
01:03:44 And the place just going insane and just loving every second of it
01:03:48 There was also this moment where up on up on the rafters
01:03:52 We were down on the ground floor watching them play
01:03:54 But up in the rafters there was a couple of people standing and watching the band from up above
01:03:59 There was a mamimi cosplayer just dancing by herself
01:04:03 And just watching her dance while listening to
01:04:06 Fucking crazy sunshine and and you know all the shit from the show
01:04:12 Uh, fuck. What's that one? I think I can all that shit
01:04:16 Watching her dance by herself was just such a magical moment
01:04:19 And I'll always regret not going up and joining her that's stuck with me my whole life
01:04:24 My relationship with women
01:04:25 I mean, I would still lose my shit for a pillows concert
01:04:28 But I can't even imagine like me at 17 at the same age I saw jam project
01:04:33 If I if I had heard fucking hybrid rainbow live when I was 17, I would have cried a river
01:04:40 I would have been losing my fucking mind to that
01:04:43 So yeah, I can definitely appreciate what you're saying there
01:04:46 So that was great, but then also at the time I still gave a shit about voice actors
01:04:50 And I don't think I'd really care about these things as much now
01:04:53 But there were two incidents that were that are very memorable to me
01:04:57 One was when I met Steve Blum. He was doing something. I think it was it was this was the gurren login thing
01:05:03 He was signing autographs. I think for his role as learon
01:05:06 And um, I went up to him and and and said hi and shook his hand and I told him
01:05:11 I'll never forget this. I I said hey, dude
01:05:13 I know that you get this all the time, but I just loved you as spike and I was like
01:05:18 I know he's doing some other character, but that's what I remember before
01:05:20 I'm sure he's gonna hate me for it. He's just like dude. It never gets old. I love it every time
01:05:25 And he smiled at me and I went on my way and I just felt so great about my life
01:05:29 I I think it was incredible. Yeah, I might hate dubs more than anybody in the world
01:05:33 But I could still probably mark out for Steve Blum like
01:05:37 He's a fucking legend. He's he's a legend been in everything. Um, and then there was this other moment
01:05:44 Here, this is my last thing. I even have to say
01:05:47 When I was at some like fma would gotten really big and I was at a convention
01:05:52 I think this was anime boston and it was a panel
01:05:55 Uh, like the voice actors or something and I didn't give a shit about anyone except vik manjana was there. He was cool
01:06:00 Tell me a case of vik manjana story. I know and this this is classic vik manjana
01:06:05 Like just being weirdly obsessed with the character of ed, but he did this thing. He's like, hey guys, um
01:06:11 I was like taking questions or whatever and somebody asked him to like do a line from the show
01:06:15 I mean, of course, right and so he's like, okay. All right guys, but I've gotten good at this
01:06:19 So let we're all going to go through an exercise because this is the best way for you to experience this
01:06:23 I don't want you to see me god
01:06:25 This is this this is this tells me so much about him as a man right now
01:06:28 But he's like, okay. I don't want you to see me as like this old like 30 something, you know, slightly balding
01:06:34 That motherfucker is 15 now. So he was probably in his 40s
01:06:38 Yeah, okay, maybe he even said 30s and was lying. I don't know. I can't remember but uh, that that'd be hilarious
01:06:43 That was true
01:06:43 But he said like I don't want you to see me as this old man
01:06:45 Everyone close your eyes and just listen to my voice and he did like I think he did the monologue from
01:06:50 After the barry the butcher fight, you know what I'm talking about where he's like crying about like he realized how vulnerable
01:06:56 He is how much he cares about that's the scene that that
01:07:00 Made his whole career oscar bait scene from fma. It's the reason that he won every fucking
01:07:05 Voice actor award for dubbing ever and that's why he's so fucking famous is for that one scene pretty much
01:07:12 And he did it and at the time I was definitely an fma fan
01:07:16 And he did it with such passion and just clearly
01:07:19 Loved doing what he did so much and loved the character so much regardless of the reasons why
01:07:24 Yeah, it was just that was just a great experience that really made me get into anime in a big way
01:07:30 If this was like 2006, I probably would have felt exactly the same
01:07:33 I I loved that performance when I was young. Um, he killed it on that one how I hate it
01:07:38 I did get to just that that's the just that's the end of my case for how
01:07:42 These things I think like now like like you were saying
01:07:44 I don't think these would really make as much of an impact on me because I've had all these experiences
01:07:48 But when I was a kid first getting into the stuff not knowing much to see the world
01:07:52 That's out there and the passion these people are putting in I can see why
01:07:56 Like I get this stuff and I understand why it's valuable
01:08:00 Seeing the stuff and and seeing the things people can do with it and like why my parents just don't
01:08:04 They haven't had any of these experiences. They don't get shit about this. They just think it's goofy cartoons
01:08:08 You know just two or three years ago at ozakan. I also met ed's voice actor, but the real one talk to rome
01:08:16 Uh, the japanese voice actress who's one of my favorite voice actresses and she was so fucking
01:08:21 She was the
01:08:22 You know sometimes you see someone there's there's certain celebrities that I have that that like
01:08:29 That waifu or idol like crush on she's one of those she's just so perfect and hilarious and
01:08:37 And adorable and I absolutely love her and I would
01:08:41 Sacrifice my life to for her
01:08:44 No, she's she was great
01:08:47 Yeah, I want to throw in a bit
01:08:50 Uh, I'll probably have more to say about this possibly in the future if I take up any of these because I've run
01:08:55 I've run a few uh panels at conventions
01:08:58 The first one I did was at necocon, which is why I went to necocon that year because
01:09:03 Me and this guy named uh, what who? Oh, sorry. I just said that makes sense as to why you went to this one
01:09:08 Yeah, yeah, um, it was like 2010. I think and it was me and this guy named pats who is another anime blogger
01:09:14 And uh, we ran a panel called
01:09:17 Released and relinquished shows that had been licensed and dubbed in english, but no one paid attention to them
01:09:24 So yeah, it was just like a you know, it was just a recommendation panel
01:09:27 Which that's another thing that like at the time kind of made sense
01:09:31 But now it's like why would you ever want recommendations?
01:09:34 There's there's the internet has entire websites dedicated to anime recommendations
01:09:39 You don't need a panel not that it would still be a successful panel, but um
01:09:44 The internet's definitely made these things even more obsolete obviously. Yeah, uh, but it was a pretty good turnout for it and
01:09:51 Um, and then of course I've done three panels at brony con
01:09:55 One with tom one with the you know with you guys and and then another one with with just the pcp members
01:10:02 uh
01:10:04 I think that was actually called the horseshoe crew or something that time. It was called the horse cast live dog
01:10:08 Do you guys remember my ancient lumarian questions?
01:10:12 I I remember I I know I've blocked them out
01:10:17 Smurfs too, right? No, no, no, no something far more sinister
01:10:20 He he had like a long question about ancient lumarians that are at uh
01:10:25 That of course I I I basically just relayed to you the history of spirit sign
01:10:29 Science at a horseshoe panel that went on for easily seven minutes
01:10:34 And by the end there's no way it was seven minutes long. I don't believe you and no the entire crowd
01:10:39 Hated me. You know like like is he reading this off his phone?
01:10:43 Why why is it taking so long?
01:10:45 And I just kept going on and on about how like the ancient lumarians are like
01:10:50 Fucking building bunchy like the animal you are
01:10:52 Are fucking behind all my little pony and and how trial at sparkle was like like like an agent of the fucking devil
01:11:00 And it was uh, it was great. I remember your I think it was I think it was you specifically Nate
01:11:05 Uh, you said something along the lines of I don't know. I don't care
01:11:08 Stop good. Oh, thank god
01:11:11 I had enough to do something about it. All right. I remember wanting to kill you
01:11:15 You're so fucking good. I loved there is a video of that of that. Um panel on my channel
01:11:21 I haven't looked it in a long time. So far. I remember anything
01:11:23 I started a lot if I if I had given that one today
01:11:26 I would have been a lot more confident in my assertion of luminary that would have there have been more niggers in
01:11:31 Oh, there would be oh, there would be so oh, yeah
01:11:34 He's really come into his own with the whole
01:11:38 Yeah, uh
01:11:40 I would say I've never liked panels
01:11:43 And then like like I've I've been to maybe five panels and all my like seven cons I've gone to
01:11:49 Uh, they all fucking suck
01:11:51 I've had some of my like
01:11:53 A lot of my best con experiences have been panels like the one uh, charles dunbar gave on kill lock hill that totally changed my opinion of the show
01:12:01 Um, and like I've seen a bunch of wish I could see that panel. I'd like to see that panel
01:12:05 Yeah, I wish it existed somewhere. He was supposedly writing a book of that panel and I don't think it ever came out. Okay. Yeah, but um
01:12:14 So
01:12:15 Yeah, I've been to some that like really changed my opinion of shows or just educated me on stuff
01:12:19 Some are just fun and interesting like uh, there's one dude who always does like a japanese noise panel
01:12:25 Like literally about noise music, which is such a weird fucking obscure thing to do at a con
01:12:31 But he was like this really knowledgeable dude like being in a room with like 40 other guys
01:12:36 And listening to fucking noise music is a surreal and hilarious experience
01:12:42 Um that I highly recommend you know why I fear every panel I go to it's because I I've mentioned this before
01:12:50 I don't trust congoers to not embarrass themselves
01:12:53 And I am such a wonderful sensitive human being that when other people humiliate themselves
01:12:58 I feel humiliated so I can't I can't abide cringes. Thankfully. I've gotten I guess so I've gotten really good at both
01:13:05 I mean, there's certain people who do panels like charles dunbar the guy who did that kill out kill panel
01:13:10 He goes to like he gets invited to like 13 cons a year and does like five panels per con
01:13:16 So like he it's practically a job for him
01:13:19 So for someone like that like you know, they're gonna put on a good panel. It's good. You know, I'm not talking about him
01:13:24 I mean when well, I mean that's always a possibility
01:13:27 But I just specifically meant when they get questions from the crowd
01:13:30 Those people like the good ones the good panels usually don't do that. Like yeah, thank god
01:13:35 You know the really good the people who know what they're doing will probably have a fully stacked 90 minutes
01:13:41 I mean, there's a lot of panels that are an absolute garbage fire
01:13:44 Even at like ozacon because it'll be people who don't know what they're doing
01:13:48 And they'll get up there and just like either not know their subject or not be prepared or someone doesn't show up
01:13:53 Or something breaks
01:13:55 But i'm pretty good at figuring out which ones those are gonna be because like every year at ozacon
01:13:59 One of my friends will tell me like yeah, we went to that one because you know
01:14:02 It had a hilarious title and it sounded like it would be great
01:14:05 But it turned out they had no idea what they were doing and I was like you could tell that by the description
01:14:09 You know like if it's just a hilarious title, but it does but there's no like indication of who's running the panel or like
01:14:15 You know, uh
01:14:17 Like something something in the description that catches your eye. It's probably not good
01:14:22 God I had something like that at brone con it was like like there was this one panel
01:14:26 But I went to and I could have found out that was bad by the description
01:14:29 It was it like I read the description and it was something like thoroughly analyzing my little pony live or something
01:14:34 Fucking awful like that. I wouldn't anyway see that one coming
01:14:42 Press one if that was the shittiest joke you've ever heard your entire fucking life
01:14:46 I actually didn't see it coming
01:14:49 really
01:14:51 But but you know our panels were like awful. I mean people loved them, but
01:14:56 Literally had no plan for any panel
01:14:59 I tried to put together a plan, but you guys were just like let's just say questions
01:15:03 Let's just say question which frankly was a better idea
01:15:05 So just because the the crowd just wants to hear us talk
01:15:08 They don't give a fuck and we're all funny and we can just riff off of whatever they say, you know
01:15:13 um, yeah, and I think I mean for me personally, I think that
01:15:17 My sense of humor nowhere shines better than in answering questions at a at a convention panel like that
01:15:23 I think that's if when I make videos, they're not funny
01:15:27 On this podcast I hit or miss, but I think I can actually be funny in that situation
01:15:33 Well, whatever I see my favorite panel that I've um, I've ever like seen in a video
01:15:38 setting has always been like ego raptors like
01:15:41 Solo panel where he's just talking about stuff to a crowd. He's he's standing around with a mic
01:15:46 He is good at that. He's good at that. That was just it's just such a night
01:15:50 It made me like the idea of panels and want to be on a panel by myself just say yeah, yeah
01:15:55 I'm just chatting with it. I mean, I knew it would be like I gotta admit
01:15:59 He handled that panel like a pro the way that ego raptor runs favorite videos of his the way that he runs his panels
01:16:04 Is exactly how I tried to do so like I mean with the with the two that we did as a group
01:16:09 Then there was a lot more like spread out as a group. It's kind of difficult
01:16:13 Yeah, because everyone wants to say something but the one that was just me and tom
01:16:17 I mean, you know
01:16:19 At all the panels. I usually am the one who does the most talking but the one with me and tom in particular was like
01:16:25 It was pretty much me in the crowd and then tom offering thoughts sometimes about you know, like when I asked him
01:16:30 Tom, what do you think about this?
01:16:33 But it was great fun to do that and I'd love to do yeah
01:16:36 Doing solo panels is super fun and I'd love to do it all the time
01:16:41 Just imagine how important you feel as the only guy up there, you know, yeah, I'm interested in it mostly for the power trip
01:16:48 That's what I want. That's what I want the power trips a lot of fun and just the feeling well
01:16:52 Because like what what I think makes it what what makes it fun for me is that it's an opportunity to simultaneously
01:16:59 Like
01:17:00 Say to the crowd, you know
01:17:02 Hey, you guys are all great and I really appreciate all of you while also just ragging on them incessantly
01:17:08 Because that's what I like when people ask me a dumb question. I will I will make them
01:17:12 I'll I'll answer it in such a way that's like you're a dumb
01:17:16 But thankfully you've given me the tools for me to use my genius to make this interesting, you know
01:17:22 That's the right way to do it. Yeah, it's uh, it's fun
01:17:26 Great
01:17:27 Uh, and and I've I've been um
01:17:30 Recently I've been invited to some conventions
01:17:34 There's one in particular in new jersey and they want me to come up. It's in like
01:17:38 I don't know
01:17:40 April or may or june, maybe june
01:17:43 Then they're like they want me to come up and they they they said we want you to do like two or three panels
01:17:49 and I was like, uh
01:17:51 Is anyone else presenting at this convention?
01:17:54 Um, but yeah, they were they're offering to like, you know pay for my trip and everything to to do that
01:17:58 It might be worth and I'm considering it. I haven't decided yet because I don't know what I'm gonna be doing in june
01:18:04 Like I might not even live in virginia by june. Um, that that's true
01:18:08 So, you know what though, can I just say on that point?
01:18:11 There's one thing I didn't mention that is actually by far the most important thing to me about conventions
01:18:17 Uh, and so I would definitely go to that and any other ones that were offered to me
01:18:21 Because of my dream I've had since I was a very young man
01:18:24 And it's not it's not a lofty dream
01:18:26 But it is a dream
01:18:26 I've had consistently for most of my life and it's to fuck a cosplayer girl at an anime convention
01:18:32 I will do whatever it takes to make that happen at some point in my life if you want to get into fucking
01:18:38 stories of fleeting but very deep and real love
01:18:42 Uh that I've had with women at conventions who I did not speak to my god
01:18:48 Like I have I have a lot of like vivid memories of women
01:18:52 I immediately fell in love with
01:18:54 Here's one that we all shared uh, at least most of us who are in our remember our spot at brony con
01:18:59 We all looked down to get collectively
01:19:00 I know jesse was there and I think most of the people here were we looked down and there was just a raven
01:19:05 From teentines cosplayer sitting there alone with a book open just reading a book on the side of the open convention hall
01:19:12 But not bothering anybody just quietly being there perfectly cosplaying raven
01:19:17 Just being by yourself reading a fucking book and we all instantly fell in love with there
01:19:21 All of us together in the same way nate that you were like always wondering
01:19:25 Uh, I should have gone on dance with that girl that I I was always like remember that and I'm like
01:19:29 I should have just gone up and said that's a really it's really cool that you're reading like that
01:19:33 Why didn't we damn nothing nothing is cooler to me than method cosplayers. They are truly the best
01:19:40 There's this one dude um who
01:19:42 One year at the karaoke. There's this guy who was dressed as kamina and he had like the perfect build for it
01:19:48 He was like an he was a you know a perfect kamina cosplayer and he was like dancing and raving
01:19:54 He's saying the masinger opening
01:19:56 Yeah, which is awesome and he was like totally down for everyone else's stuff
01:19:59 He was like being this hype guy right then the next year. He shows up as uh, dr. Frankenstein from soul leader
01:20:07 Again a perfect spot on cosplay and he even had the he had the giant
01:20:11 I don't know if you know Frankenstein, but he has like a screw coming out of his head that he twists
01:20:15 Yeah, it's got the big bolt. He actually had that and was able to turn it and make clicking sounds when he turned it
01:20:20 He put a hole in his fucking brain
01:20:23 Goddamn, okay, additionally he he had he was insisting insistently sitting in chairs backwards because that's how stein sits
01:20:32 Yeah, and I was just like the fucking dedication like in this guy's mind
01:20:36 He just is dr. Stein and it was so legend like it because it made me realize that like him acting so hype the year before
01:20:43 Was because he was Kamina like you know because this year he wasn't being hype
01:20:48 He was just like sitting on the chair, you know being that man's name was dustin hoffman
01:20:55 What a legend of cosplay
01:20:59 That's the first method actor who came to mind that was the first one I could think of that's right
01:21:04 Also could have gone with christian bale or whoever the fuck you want. Uh, why not uh the guy from
01:21:10 The guy with the mustache from there will be the guy who killed himself
01:21:12 Uh, uh, heath ledger heath ledger. Yeah, there you go. And that man's name was yon renkowski the actor jace w commons
01:21:21 Yes, it was him all along austin
01:21:24 Uh, that is the the the whole method acted thing
01:21:27 Like that the fact that people can do that is the reason i'm i'm always apprehensive of being a cosplayer because nobody likes
01:21:34 You know somebody putting the costume together and it being yeah, it's pretty good pretty good
01:21:38 And then you go up to them and they're just some fucking actually actually
01:21:41 There's an entire uh giant legion of of people who dress up as a they dress up really well
01:21:46 But don't act the part at all and it's called fucking women every fucking time
01:21:50 They can't act a for shit. They just they're just
01:21:54 Talking about slots. What what what about the raven cosplayer we were just talking about she's completely
01:22:01 I don't respect her or women. No, it's uh, she she's a hero. She's a hero
01:22:06 I don't respect sexy cosplay girls outside of wanting to fuck them
01:22:10 And that is what I will use them for throughout my life. So, you know, I appreciate that on that basis
01:22:13 How much of okay, I feel like I might be the ultimate convention creeper, but it's all on the download
01:22:19 It doesn't hurt anybody so it's okay. That's fine because because you know
01:22:23 You always hear these stories about women who like have guys like all over them and stuff and like
01:22:28 Predator tactics and they're always taking now at a convention
01:22:31 Everyone takes pictures of cosplayers and I've always been super duper shy
01:22:36 About like asking to take someone's picture. I don't know why I just feel really like I know that everyone expects it
01:22:42 And yet I feel like I can't do it
01:22:45 And usually I'll just jump in when someone else is taking the picture
01:22:48 But there's particularly been cases where I saw a girl in a cosplay and I was so in love with her that I felt
01:22:55 It would be wrong of me to take a picture because I secretly am doing so because I'm nefariously in love with them
01:23:03 So I won't I get even more afraid
01:23:07 But man, I'm just I'm running through the like rolodex of images of like I remember that girl's cosplay
01:23:13 I'm just curious. Well the very first girl
01:23:16 I remember just being absolutely in love with based on their cosplay
01:23:19 Was the first year at otacon because we were in the line going into the building
01:23:23 And this girl just like kind of like fastly walked past
01:23:27 And it was a really small asian girl in a boogie pop costume
01:23:31 And I was I at the time boogie pop was my favorite thing in the universe and no one knew about it or talked about it
01:23:38 Most people didn't even know that boogie pop is actually a you know, a little girl who or a young teenage girl
01:23:46 You know a small one so conventions are a place where you go to fall in love as a young man
01:23:51 It's really true and as an old man
01:23:54 Every year every year at karaoke broken man as well
01:23:57 Every single year at karaoke some girl will get up and do a performance with so much heart that i'm like
01:24:02 Why am I not I actually do like this with with the younger ones when it was just cosplay
01:24:07 That was more of like this fleeting sense of brilliance of like
01:24:10 Oh my god, if if only but when it comes to the karaoke
01:24:13 I actually legitimately feel like i'm an idiot for not talking to those girls
01:24:16 I had this woman tied up in the back of my car driving away right now
01:24:20 Yeah, if only I was reenacting the stan music video with this girl right now
01:24:25 But but like with like last like for instance last year at otakon
01:24:29 There was this girl who did like a cosplay performance and it wasn't that she was like
01:24:33 Unbelievably cute or anything. She just did a really great karaoke performance and I was like I can't imagine a more perfect
01:24:41 Like like legitimately a more perfect match for me than a girl who does passionate anime karaoke
01:24:46 Like this is literally the kind of person I should be seeking out to date and of course I didn't say anything
01:24:52 Uh, and I I regret it weak man. It's a different kind of regret
01:24:56 There's that there's that that that hopeless romantic regret of I saw like the you're beautiful
01:25:03 And I saw your face in a crowded place
01:25:07 And I don't know what you know, and he kills himself at the end of the song
01:25:12 That is more like the early cosplay stuff. This is more like. Yep. Wow. I'm a fucking idiot. Why didn't I talk to this girl?
01:25:20 um the feeling I think that's sort of the uh, the the the digivolved form of this emotion, you know, it's leveled up
01:25:27 To use the term that you people will understand
01:25:31 I I know what you're this has only happened once to me before and just as that zoro whoever
01:25:37 Cosplay changed Nate's life
01:25:39 There's one cosplayer that changed my life and and jumpstarted me into the era of my life
01:25:43 I like to refer to as the overly sentimental gay asshole not seinfeld era
01:25:49 Okay, okay, I wish I will not go into detail about uh, just hope it had happened
01:25:54 Could you tell us what the cosplay was? Uh, no
01:25:58 Okay
01:26:01 I have um, I think I know I've seen a few
01:26:04 Digi digi, dude, if you talk, I'm gonna I'm not I'm gonna act. I'm gonna actually pee my pants
01:26:12 Don't do it. Did you don't do it? I won't
01:26:17 Yeah, okay. Yeah, I've uh, yeah, I haven't really um
01:26:21 Like had a an amazing experience with a cosplayer
01:26:24 I mean, I really like a lot of them and it's been like cool to see that some people are actually really good
01:26:30 But the moment I see a risk of cosplayer, I will not waste a second. I will go up to her and I will say
01:26:37 Uh, uh, you're you're cool or something
01:26:41 Because good that'll that'll be my my ultimate pickup line. You're all
01:26:45 Becky, you're cool. You are cool with just the letters. You are cool
01:26:49 I'll say it like that and then they'll she'll hug me. Oh, what a what a dream
01:26:55 What a fantasy that is, you know, cosplayers are real hugs sluts, you know, they're past that shit out easy
01:27:00 Oh, oh, they they can't wait for that. Let's go to anime for right now
01:27:04 You know, it's kind of a shame because it used to be back in the day that cons were a lot more like physical
01:27:10 Like yeah, glomp me people used to go glomp me sign. Yeah, they used to be glomping
01:27:14 They used to be the yaoi paddles where they were hitting girls just walk around hitting people with paddles and I don't know
01:27:20 And now there's all these cosplay is not consent. Well, which it totally is so that's bullshit
01:27:26 Boy, is that actually a thing? That is exactly a thing. Yeah, that's that's that unfortunately is a very real thing
01:27:32 Well, I wonder if it's actually real that this was a problem like did people assume cosplay was consent
01:27:38 That's news to me. There there is a lot of harassment of of a of female cosplayers at conventions
01:27:44 I get that but I and male actually
01:27:47 Okay, I I don't mean to to go over the top here
01:27:49 But aren't they I mean I'm talking about harassment in the sense of like calling to them in like reasonable ways
01:27:55 No, I'm talking about harassment kind of asking for it
01:27:58 I'm talking about like actual physical harassment does happen a lot of conventions. Well, that's not okay. Yeah, that's yeah
01:28:06 But unless they're dressed like a slut in which case
01:28:09 I mean
01:28:10 Unless they're brisket. Yeah, and in my very complex and not useful
01:28:15 Notes that I jotted down that don't bode well or don't don't translate well into this type of podcast
01:28:21 And therefore I wasted about 30 minutes. I wrote down the words uh slut in all caps at least five times
01:28:31 Yeah, is there anything else at your notes you want to read off? I think we're kind of winding down here
01:28:35 Well, see my my my notes were just ever kind I've gone to and how I felt at each con and the interesting parts of it
01:28:44 Hmm
01:28:45 So that sounds a little detailed, but we get the gist of how positive of why you enjoyed them
01:28:50 And how it's a little bit different than our experience in general. I mean, there's some weird themes
01:28:55 Yeah, you reminded me. I wanted to talk about uh a way that cons
01:28:58 Um have started evolving for me. I'm trying to make them evolve
01:29:01 And it didn't work out as well as I wanted it to at this last note to con
01:29:04 But um, so I know a lot of older congoers and eventers like there's this one
01:29:11 This one anime blogger called omoe kane who's like probably in his late 30s now and he's like a he's a lifetime eventer
01:29:18 He goes he like flies to japan just to go to events and stuff got a lot of money, right?
01:29:22 Goes to lots of shit and um those guys always talk about how like when you go to a convention
01:29:28 It's not really about just going to the convention. It's about going to that city and doing stuff there, you know
01:29:35 and baltimore
01:29:37 You know where the convention center is is right in the middle of like a big strip
01:29:41 That's like famous for its restaurants and stuff and and bars
01:29:44 So like at this past otacon
01:29:46 I really went there with the intention of like i'm not going to hang out at the convention center most of the time
01:29:51 I want to go
01:29:52 And uh, you know go go out and eat go to all these fancy places because I'd been going to this con since 2008
01:29:58 You know, it's always in the same place and I never really been to all the places around that are like all the tourist attractions
01:30:04 Like all that stuff is advertised on the website for otacon
01:30:07 You know, they really push the idea that like hey, you're in baltimore try the crab
01:30:10 We're famous for our crab, you know go to go to all these different places
01:30:13 I tried the crab and then you were betrayed by that restaurant
01:30:16 Well, not only was I betrayed by yeah, we tear in a dog was one of the worst restaurant experiences ever
01:30:23 That was a brony con wasn't it or yeah, I like that place. I don't know. Yeah, we went there brony con
01:30:28 They were fine when we went at otacon. It was absolutely garbage
01:30:32 But then like
01:30:33 Aside from that there were two major issues that I didn't account for and that made it not worth it to go to all these places
01:30:40 Because I didn't care about the money. I had money. I had saved up a bunch
01:30:43 I was like i'm gonna go and spare no expense go to all the interesting stuff the two big miscalculations were one
01:30:49 I was the only person with money
01:30:52 So I had no one. Oh, that's the word. I just went to all these places alone
01:30:56 You know like yeah, and number two is that it was like the hottest day in recorded history
01:31:02 For like one of the days of the con so like
01:31:05 And and also just that baltimore stretch is it's not a great it's it's honestly
01:31:11 It's too spread out
01:31:12 There's too much space in between all the all the restaurants and stuff and none of them are that great
01:31:18 It's it's overhyped, you know
01:31:20 I remember one point. I like walked a mile in the fucking
01:31:25 Unbelievable heat, you know sweating fucking balls and I went to some crab place and
01:31:31 It was I don't even really like crab like I I was I was hoping that by eating like such a high class crab
01:31:39 That it would be different. But no, it's just crab, you know, so
01:31:43 I was like well
01:31:44 Fuck fuck these restaurants. Fuck this town. Fuck baltimore. I'll go somewhere else
01:31:49 But I do think that's a very interesting way to explore conventions is to not just worry about the convention
01:31:55 And I kind of learned more of that from brony con where each year at brony con
01:31:59 I only spent like probably half of it in the con spent a lot of time in hotel rooms with other people, you know
01:32:04 Unfortunately not having sex like no fucking panels didn't even yeah
01:32:08 No, we literally other than the panel we ran we did not attend a single thing at the last brony con right to
01:32:16 We just sat around
01:32:18 And it was a much better time for it. Yeah
01:32:20 Uh
01:32:21 Although that year their fucking was no seating anywhere like we spent the whole first day just looking for where to sit
01:32:28 Our spot too, which was fucking bullshit. Yeah, it was retarded
01:32:31 That was that was a huge part of why I didn't want to go back because I was like, you know
01:32:34 It'd be one thing if we were all going to go and sit, but there wasn't even anywhere to sit
01:32:37 We were like fucking roaming around looking for where we could fucking hang out
01:32:42 That's that was fucking garbage
01:32:45 But yeah, I hang out in a lot of hotel rooms hang out with people, you know
01:32:49 Stuff like like what what bunny hop just did at magfest where he made that video about the sony playstation
01:32:54 Where it's like, you know, he got to go like into this very exclusive room where they endo playstation. Yeah, that's what I meant
01:33:01 the nintendo playstation and
01:33:03 You know and there's video of like him doing vr with jeff and shut shit like that
01:33:07 Like that's that's fun stuff at conventions that people don't take into account when they think about it
01:33:12 And that that's the element. I'd like to explore more
01:33:15 Um going to conventions in the future, especially the money spending part
01:33:18 Like it's a great way to just treat it as a vacation and go to a bunch of places
01:33:22 Unfortunately, if all your friends are fucking poor then uh, you're gonna do all that stuff alone
01:33:27 Which is you know, when you when you go to an expensive restaurant by yourself
01:33:31 All you're thinking about is how much money you're spending on the food
01:33:34 Like there's no like that's that's all it is. It's like I sit down and I go
01:33:38 This is a 16 dollar crab cake. I'm about to spend 16 dollars
01:33:43 So all I'm thinking while I'm eating it is is this worth 16 dollars? This probably isn't worth 16 dollars, you know
01:33:50 Yep, um
01:33:51 Yeah, dude, uh
01:33:53 Conventions are great
01:33:55 All this talk about how you don't like conventions just convinced me even more that I love conventions
01:33:59 I mean, I wasn't trying to present the idea that I don't like conventions just that as I've gotten older
01:34:05 My what I get out of them has changed and I definitely think I will enjoy them again
01:34:09 If I go about them differently going with the the crowd
01:34:13 I've been going with where we all just kind of split up and go our own ways is not fun
01:34:17 Uh, you know, that's why we're gonna stick together bro. I'm gonna be on your ass like your dick is fucking gay
01:34:22 Which is very
01:34:24 Both of the both of those can be preceded with the adjective very and and also, uh, I don't I don't know
01:34:30 Where your hotel is muchy and relative in relative to the convention right next to it
01:34:34 Yeah, I highly advise
01:34:36 Everyone if you're going to a con plan ahead get a fucking room near the convention. It's so much vastly superior
01:34:44 It's like a whole different world when you're close enough
01:34:47 And this this past otacon we tried to do that think think about how you're gonna get girls back to your room guys
01:34:52 Plan your route plan out how you're gonna do that shit
01:34:54 I mean even beyond that just like like every year at these conventions
01:34:59 We would always get a a hotel that's like 10 minutes out of town and like you can't hang out and drink all night because like
01:35:06 Some if you're especially for sharing a room if even one person gets tired
01:35:10 You know, then it's like the rest of us are holding that person like forcing them to be at the con while we do our shit
01:35:16 You know and then
01:35:18 You know, we all have to leave at a certain time
01:35:20 There's sort of like a curfew and you can't just hang out and enjoy it at your own pace or anything
01:35:24 And then like this past year we got a place that was like close enough to the convention that it could be walked
01:35:30 But it was it was a fucking
01:35:34 40 minute walk. So it was not fun
01:35:36 Um, especially in that heat like we ended up, you know, my friends mostly ended up taking like lift uh to and from the convention
01:35:42 It was like, oh, yeah, that's what I would you know, it wasn't even worth it
01:35:45 um
01:35:46 To walk that distance so like by all means get a place nearby
01:35:50 It makes it so much easier to hang out and enjoy the uh atmosphere
01:35:55 So, okay, uh, Gabe, do you have any closing thoughts on your uh, convention?
01:35:59 We're only an hour and 36 minutes into this
01:36:02 All right, but I want to go to questions because I feel like we've explored this pretty thoroughly by this
01:36:05 Yeah, I want to talk about fucking brony con
01:36:09 You already talked about brony con. Go ahead. I like brony con. If you have anything worth saying, then go ahead and say it
01:36:14 Brony con 2013
01:36:16 boring digi-bur
01:36:19 crazy
01:36:20 uh next note brony con
01:36:23 2014
01:36:24 horror uh
01:36:27 I love ben sainte. Yep actual activities. I told you met him, right? No
01:36:32 Yep, that's where I met him the first thing that ben's ever said to me
01:36:35 Uh, uh, I was I like I shook hands with digi
01:36:38 I was like, hey and then like like he moves out of the way like out of out of like the camera like view
01:36:44 Like the eye camera and then I like pan over to this fucking retard and his name is ben sainte
01:36:50 And he shakes my hand that time he was named phantom horn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and and he just says hey
01:36:55 I've heard a lot about you
01:36:57 And I haven't heard anything about him, but then I found out brony con 2015
01:37:01 Hey, you know when I uh you this might amuse you to know munchie at that time when ben told me about you
01:37:06 I thought you were way over hyped. I thought you
01:37:12 That's right, buddy. What does that mean exactly? What what?
01:37:16 How is he hyped exactly?
01:37:17 This is my art that I'm presenting to you for you to interpret however you wish
01:37:21 So you were over hyped. There you go. Like like like over hyped
01:37:25 I don't remember ever
01:37:28 I'll explain the joke I guess because ben was really excited about munchie and thought he was really cool and I was like
01:37:34 Oh, yeah, ben was definitely ben ben was in love with munchie from a from an early point. It's been a big cheerleader of yours
01:37:41 It mutual mutual brony con 2015 end of rome. I hate romans

01:38:32 I'm honestly not
01:38:34 Nate you brought this upon your fucking self. I don't believe you. There's no way that we've devolved to this level on my fucking show
01:38:41 Munchie, I won't have it still going. What could you possibly that's too long? Yeah, you blew it buddy
01:38:46 You went too long now. I know that you're pouring shit. Do you want me to send you a picture, Nate?
01:38:49 Do you really? Yeah, send me a goddamn picture of you pissing on your computer. Okay?

01:39:12 Oh, send me send me bottle that piss and email that to me so I can see you're all over my phone. Hold on
01:39:18 Okay, anyway, we were supposed to be listening to fucking gibb talk about something
01:39:25 Take it away, buddy. I don't think I can top that
01:39:29 Anything could top that that was rock bottom
01:39:32 Okay, all right
01:39:35 I'm gonna go to
01:39:37 I don't know. What was the anime expo where there's homestuck stuff? Yeah
01:39:41 I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna find and talk to a human being called brisket and I'm gonna say you're cool and I'm gonna
01:39:47 She's not a human being hopefully
01:39:48 Oh, oh, yeah. Well, I'm gonna troll an alien girl alien girl
01:39:55 And uh, I'm gonna buy a homestuck thing and that's gonna be my future for cons
01:40:00 And or going with jeff to magfest to meet real cool guys
01:40:05 The good news is there's lots of risk of cosplayers at least there were
01:40:09 How how long is hippo? Do you think like what what's the timetable on this plan?
01:40:12 Like could you actually afford to do any of this in the next year?
01:40:16 um in the I mean I
01:40:20 Technically I can but it would be eating into stuff that I kind of want to save up for like
01:40:24 In case I you know die. Yeah, because I'm probably going to anime expo with munchie this year
01:40:29 So there is a room out there. You can join
01:40:35 In july
01:40:38 Yeah, some of plain journeys are really yeah, you could room with us. There'd be no problem
01:40:43 I could just have to hear me piss a lot. Munchie has just apple juice, dude
01:40:46 I know you're a big apple juice guy. You poured apple juice into that glass. What happened? No, no
01:40:51 Maybe you should have a taste Nate. It looks pretty fuck. It looks like piss, dude
01:40:55 I think he actually pissed although that cup looks too small for the amount of time that piss went on for
01:41:01 It's not there would have been less. Oh, you're actually looking at it. You gross gross
01:41:06 It's just apple juice, dude. Don't worry. Don't worry. He made sure to post this in the ben saint chat, by the way
01:41:12 Yeah, he sure did
01:41:14 sure did
01:41:16 uh anyway
01:41:19 Maybe I could come to anime expo. I would need to make a bit more of a patreon buck
01:41:24 Yeah, or something go to youtube.com slash patreon slash louis batton
01:41:30 I guess
01:41:31 Give me money for that
01:41:32 So I can go find briska and live my dream
01:41:35 Of saying hello. My briska's living her dream. My briska's living her dream. My briska's living her dream. That's an old good meme
01:41:43 Um, yep. Good old meme old good. Are we ready to answer the uh questions here?
01:41:48 I think so. Uh, by the way, I just want to reiterate my point everybody. I still think it's a good
01:41:53 I think that's a wise policy. It's for children conventions are for children
01:41:57 Take your kids somewhere if you want them to be indoctrinated into that culture and to have some crazy experiences because they're kids
01:42:03 And they don't know what real life is like yet. There you go. Okay. All right. Here's some questions. Um
01:42:09 Now actually there were some pretty good questions on here as I was looking through
01:42:12 Oh, where's the one I was looking at? Um, oh, okay. Here's a very specific question
01:42:16 But I liked it. I thought you might like this digi. This is by uh at monkey away
01:42:22 Uh procrastinators. Uh, what should I listen to while I play dark souls 3 now that I've run out of tpc
01:42:28 Podcasts in digi bro after dark content the biggest problem in the universe and then that's what I was thinking
01:42:34 Which is what I listen to almost exclusively while playing dark souls
01:42:38 There you go monkey. Perfect. Um, uh, give suggestion. No, no, it doesn't matter
01:42:44 Okay, there you go. I'll listen to dick show or biggest problem in the universe. Uh, okay. What have we got here?
01:42:50 Here's a terrible question. Uh, if you could choose any youtuber to survive the apocalypse with who would it be?
01:42:58 No duplicate answers. Uh, that anime snore
01:43:05 You would how fast would you fucking die and you would be no wait movie bug because there's plenty of
01:43:11 That's smart. I could survive for quite a while on that. Uh, I'm gonna choose
01:43:15 I'm gonna pick the only other human who's responsible that I know other than myself
01:43:20 So because we'll probably actually figure out what we're doing
01:43:23 That's true. I would choose. Um, I would choose lacy green
01:43:28 Oh, because she has those because she's a because she's a dirty slut and she's got wide birthing hips
01:43:32 So it could re could quickly
01:43:35 Create a new human race and that that would be a I'm going. I'm she's a breeder. She's my breeder is what I'm picking
01:43:40 Why did I stick? This is why I can't get a girlfriend. I I only think about my stupid guy friends
01:43:46 I'd ever think about women out there in the world
01:43:48 That I could be trapping on island with me. I couldn't think of like a I couldn't think of like a youtuber
01:43:53 Who is a female we're trapping in a post-apocalyptic sniper wolf? She's
01:43:57 It doesn't even matter like the answer should have just been any female
01:44:01 And if you yeah, it's just the only two of you. Yeah, that'd that'd be the thing to do. Uh, okay. Let's see. What else do we get?
01:44:06 I didn't get to answer you fucking. Oh, I'm sorry. You fucking whore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please go ahead
01:44:11 It would be any female. Obviously you didn't let me have my input
01:44:16 Okay
01:44:17 You could you could sex change ben saint and bring him. Oh
01:44:20 Um, no, that would work out. Well, no, that'd be that would be against nature. That'd be against god
01:44:26 Oh my god, there's so much piss in my fucking there's this one person asking these incredibly emotional questions
01:44:33 I can't but she went so far for that piss joke that it's like ruined like he's now
01:44:38 uncomfortably sitting covered in piss and like
01:44:41 It really is really fucking sad like how much like piss didn't go into the
01:44:47 Audio only piss joke that he could have faked easily
01:44:52 He went all out
01:44:54 To me like to me. I know it's real and to the listeners. I know they know it's real too. So just imagine me doing it
01:45:03 Hey, um, this person
01:45:05 Uh, okay. Well, I'm gonna answer this one real quick. Uh at ripe. Oh god, ripe
01:45:11 Rony pasta
01:45:12 Yeah, I think that's it ripe rony pasta asks opinion on the rants series. It's the best
01:45:17 Sengoku rants the genius game, uh, the rants like Sengoku rants, um
01:45:22 Gay japanese one through seven. It's all these it's these these crazy sex arrow games where you do awesome shit
01:45:28 It's a game about trying to rape your way through ancient japan
01:45:32 Yeah, but in that universe rape is like a handshake. So it's great. No one loves it. So yeah, I played, uh,
01:45:38 15 minutes of it
01:45:39 I played up until when the gameplay starts and then I looked at it and I went
01:45:43 I don't fucking comprehend this at all and I quit it. Yeah, it's fucking brutal
01:45:47 But I have one of the hardest games I've ever played. I have a hug pillow of usugi kenshin
01:45:51 Didn't know who she was for like years
01:45:54 I I got it because it was it was it was like I bought a manga magazine from japan that was it was only 30 dollars
01:46:01 Like after shipping and it came with the free dakimakura. So it was like the best deal in the world
01:46:05 I'd buy that. Um, yeah, me and my friend donson both bought it
01:46:08 We both bought the same same set because he just like told me about it. He was like, hey free dakimakura
01:46:13 And I was like, well, shit. I I just I only wanted it for weeb cred like of course
01:46:17 I mean most of what's in my room is not here because I like it. It's here because I
01:46:23 Because I wanted to have an otaku room
01:46:25 Uh because back in the day that was like a thing that they would people would post these images of the otaku
01:46:30 Room, which is like no white space anywhere. It's all anime posters and shit
01:46:34 And I always thought that was super cool and I wanted to have it so and you're you're carrying that toward this very day
01:46:39 I'm starting to work on the ceiling. I've put up a line of posters, but they look like shit and they keep falling
01:46:44 So and it's and I and I'm realizing that it's going to take even more posters than I thought to cover my whole ceiling
01:46:49 So, uh, I gotta do it before I move
01:46:52 To note on that poster things and it goes slightly back to the cons
01:46:55 Another reason why I actually like conventions is because I live in literally like minimalist like a painting
01:47:02 Like I there I have nothing in my room. I have no possessions
01:47:06 Why I'm looking up at at my at my like the only things that decorate my room
01:47:12 As a like like the only thing that isn't playing white walls is an american flag and like two undertale posters
01:47:18 I don't understand what fills the hole in your life left by not having any human companionship if you don't have stuff
01:47:24 How do you
01:47:26 Live myself and piss and
01:47:30 Yeah, how'd you get the piss out through all those hot flies?
01:47:35 Well, they joined in too. Oh, okay
01:47:38 Munchies as do you have less stuff than davoo in his room?
01:47:42 Uh, you know what? I actually have one more poster than he has
01:47:47 Impressive. Yeah impressive. Uh, okay. Let's move along here
01:47:51 Uh, here's a bunch of questions by this guy, but let's only answer one decent one by at gypsy gypsy
01:47:58 Who are your smash bros mains and why he said no, okay? Okay. No, no, shut the fuck up. This is my this is my question
01:48:04 This is my question
01:48:05 Okay, when I was a little baby boy when I little when I was a little baptist when I was a little baptist boy whipper
01:48:10 I loved curbie and so I played curbie. I got really good as curbie. This was in brawl
01:48:15 I I played melee a lot, but I didn't play a melee a lot
01:48:18 I played brawl a lot and I played brawl a lot
01:48:20 So in brawl, I really like to play curbie and then smash fork him out and I was like, hmm
01:48:25 curbie definitely is the worst character in this entire fucking game
01:48:30 And I'm really upset, but uh, you know, I really like curbie
01:48:33 So I'm gonna I'm gonna stay like a curbie curbie like a curbie curbie guy
01:48:36 Not like a not like the guy curbie, but as in like the greater like expanded star wars universe curbie
01:48:42 Uh, so I played ddd. Uh, I know how to play dd a lot. I like dd. He's a good guy. He's really slow
01:48:47 I'm slow and not in the mental way
01:48:49 I'm the fastest guy around but I'm slow as in I'm really fat and I can't move my limbs
01:48:53 And I also piss way too much because I'm full of piss
01:48:56 Anyway, and also I really like mute 2 because mute 2 is like really good in that game
01:49:00 And he's also fun
01:49:01 Um, Ganondorf is fun because he's like big and like you do like fucking has like a huge dick like huger than my like forearm
01:49:07 He's like a huge like horse dick and um, um, um, um, yes, I love super smash bros. Please. Um, I'm I'm honestly I can drooling
01:49:14 I'm drooling right now
01:49:16 All right, let's keep it together. Uh, Ganondorf's pretty good for I think he's fun to play but uh
01:49:21 Oh, he's fun to play
01:49:22 But if a tierless or any way to view the game then he's like he's like the worst
01:49:27 I I cry tears. I was gonna say I have a tear on my cheek every time I talk about tierless. You're right. You're right
01:49:34 You're right. I you are right. I can't even like I played smash. I know in smash one
01:49:40 I played Pikachu
01:49:42 But you know that game's ancient and grappling with the onset of menopause and uh, what?
01:49:49 It's a line from billion mandy, uh in in super special is melee
01:49:53 I think I played Pikachu briefly and then link or something. I don't know all I know is eventually I found
01:49:59 Samus and I've been playing samus for like eight years and she's the only character I'm any good with
01:50:04 And uh as as the people here can attest to am I not actually a pretty okay samus player
01:50:11 Yeah, it was it was funny when I played you on digi bros
01:50:13 I expected you to be like literally the worst player in the entire fucking world
01:50:18 Yeah, everyone thinks I'm just garbage at all video games
01:50:20 But I've been playing samus for so fucking long that I can actually do it
01:50:24 I still beat you. It was easy. Well, it helps that I have the way I play here is different from
01:50:28 I think how anybody else plays smash at all. So it's yeah, I think it's use or something
01:50:33 What I'm saying is I think it's just it's not that I'm great
01:50:36 It's that the way I play is so different that it takes getting used to and once much he probably figured out the patterns
01:50:42 He was able to deal with it
01:50:43 Smash is all like like you could go up against like one of the best players in the world
01:50:47 And if you just play like a retard slash differently, yeah, as as he's known to do then yeah
01:50:53 Because I just I just I fucking spam missiles and jump around like an asshole and that's how I uh, all right
01:50:58 there's acting of
01:51:01 Yeah, um, my my main since uh
01:51:04 Nintendo 64 days was always been samus and kirby because kirby could you know when he gets hit
01:51:11 You can fly it a lot
01:51:12 So that made it easy to get back to the stage and also samus because the up b was ridiculous in that first game
01:51:19 And also I hate link because my brother's always played link and that's why I don't like legends zelda as much as the metroid series
01:51:25 Yeah, I
01:51:26 Unironically have the exact same emotion my friend
01:51:30 I have like okay. My friends are divided into two types of people
01:51:35 The fucking assholes and the even worse fucking assholes
01:51:40 The first fucking assholes are the people who are like actually good at the game and they all play link
01:51:46 I'm serious. Literally everyone gets guess guess who my main is
01:51:49 Guess who my main is
01:51:51 Toon Link
01:51:53 Yes, to link to one. Yeah, I know
01:51:55 I know he's way worse and and and and the other assholes and people who play samus
01:52:01 So it's it's funny that we have two fucking degenerates in this call right now
01:52:05 You know
01:52:06 To be on to link was the guy that I've played the most over the years
01:52:09 I I have not played him much in smash 4 and now I almost exclusively play
01:52:15 Peach is my probably number one most played
01:52:18 Jigglypuff who I love to play so cool and now I play a lot of cloud because those are like s tier
01:52:24 Characters are you telling me jigglypuff is s tier wait wait wait. Yeah, hungry. Hungry box fucking
01:52:30 Is like the champion of the world just because
01:52:33 In fucking melee, not in smash 4. Smash 4 fucking jigglypuff sucks
01:52:38 Yeah, we're I'm talking about
01:52:40 I forgot to mention pacifist donkey kong is also
01:52:44 I was gonna I was gonna ask you to I was gonna ask you to explain that but then I remembered we do it in the smash
01:52:51 Let's play that I haven't uploaded yet. Yeah, which is
01:52:54 Funnily enough like during radcon. I actually edited and uploaded that video
01:52:59 But the the audio sync was like 30 seconds off
01:53:03 So I was gonna read you know like re-sync it and I just haven't gotten around to it yet
01:53:07 So that video has videos been uploaded on private for like three weeks and I just haven't fixed it
01:53:14 But it will be there. There is a like two hour long smash bros
01:53:18 Let's play with all the pcp boys in it. Yeah, it was
01:53:23 Uh, let's let's move along here. We don't got time to spend smash bros all day here. Um, yes, we do
01:53:28 What okay by on we on me once again. Hey there on we
01:53:32 Uh, what is one medium you want to create in but probably never will
01:53:39 Oh comics uh, what uh, just one just pick one. Let's not fuck around anime
01:53:45 Anime yeah, okay. There you go. Honestly honestly like
01:53:49 Uh, modern art sculpture because I've always been like really good with my hands
01:53:54 But the idea of just doing that is a career. Oh, baby. He's good with this
01:53:57 Does does architecture count as a uh art form? Yeah, sure. Why not?
01:54:04 I've always had like a hard on for architecture
01:54:06 But it's not something I have like any because it's it's all math and I hate math
01:54:10 So like there's no chance I will ever do anything with architecture, but I think it's super cool
01:54:16 Yeah, if anybody knows um anish Kapoor the guy who did that giant like mirror thing in some city and
01:54:23 And some other cool things. He's like uh an inspiration when I was in art
01:54:27 Do studying art
01:54:29 Is this the mirror thing that like caused fires on people as they were walking home?
01:54:35 It looks like a big beam that you can walk under and it's just a big mirror
01:54:39 Cool. Oh, I know that you must have seen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course
01:54:41 No, he's a famous guy. Um, he does lots of really cool sculptures like that and I've always wanted to be like a
01:54:48 Like like low-key wanted to be a big sculpture person making really cool things like that because he's one of those those fine artists
01:54:56 Who like who is actually making stuff that's interesting and not just like a
01:55:00 Something that's really delicate and has to be inside
01:55:03 Behind a glass case that's boring
01:55:05 Like he makes huge structures that the the london 2012 olympics has a giant red tower that he built and designed cool
01:55:13 Yeah, that's sick. Oh
01:55:15 Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, I want to get into but probably never will do anything with my voice including podcasts
01:55:24 You blew it mind she you blew that one
01:55:27 Well because blew that horn. Yeah, see the thing is I like I don't it's not that I dislike my voice
01:55:33 But I don't I don't think it's very versatile
01:55:36 And I would like to like sing. Well, no, I wouldn't want to sing. I don't want to do anything. I'm never mind
01:55:41 I'm looking at that red tower and it looks like a roller coaster like crumpled into a ball
01:55:47 Apparently there is like a slide that you can actually go down in that. That's pretty cool
01:55:52 Hey, um, does did the terrorist axe count as an art form because if so, oh my god, I would be so into that
01:56:00 That's just like that guy from Naruto the guy who thinks explosions are out and he makes things a little mouth. Oh, yeah, that guy
01:56:06 Deidara, Deidara, whatever that guy's name. Yeah, I don't think I made it that far into Naruto
01:56:11 Um, okay, I got katsuki. I got two more questions. I think here's one another one
01:56:16 But this is this is a good one by at gypsy gypsy. Um name one good thing to come from the pcp
01:56:22 I just helped me dude. I got under Taylor 587
01:56:26 The undertale, you know what?
01:56:28 You got it there, but and I think I think in general the the the royal rumble the royal rumble is pretty great
01:56:35 We got so much art and shit from that. It was it was great. It's the best video we've ever made
01:56:39 Also, also the new meme of me pissing on the pcp
01:56:45 Which will be a meme. I've already first seen it
01:56:48 That's also another great thing that's come out. It'll start a chain reaction every podcast that anyone is in somebody has to pee
01:56:56 I'll always be the one to do it until you pee in spite of being someone who loves peeing outdoors and in strange places
01:57:03 I could never pee into a bottle. It's just uh, it's a hang up. I can't do it
01:57:08 That was the first time I've ever done it in like six years
01:57:10 I've told that story about how my roommate pissed in bottles when I was in college, right? That's yeah
01:57:15 We don't need to go into that shit. Uh, do you think Tom my nightmare is sick?
01:57:18 Um, okay, you know, if you don't know a bottle just piss into your mouth. That's much more efficient
01:57:23 I was gonna say one more, but here's a question that I didn't see and I got to address this one by at joestar 93
01:57:30 Nate, how good was that one piece movie that you were tweeting about and let me tell you buddy
01:57:35 That one piece movie that I was watching tweeting about earlier. Um, movie six. Yeah, like baron okutsu
01:57:43 Omatsuri and the island of mystery or some bullshit like that movie number six
01:57:48 Uh, it was great. It was by far the best one piece movie
01:57:51 I've seen everyone was right. It is great
01:57:54 Uh, and to answer other questions that people were asking me
01:57:57 Now's as good a place as any because I kind of wanted to talk about this and thought I'd never get a chance
01:58:01 But here one has fallen into my lap
01:58:04 Uh, yes, I did watch it because I was reminded of that movie's existence by super eyepatch wolf
01:58:10 Um, uh, and and watching his new video about one piece today
01:58:14 Did not love his video and I watched that movie only because I was reminded that it exists
01:58:19 And do not want cucks like him to lord the fact that they've seen that movie
01:58:24 Literally no one can any longer
01:58:27 I care, right?
01:58:29 And uh, and by the way, he's dead wrong. That is not a great place to get in one piece
01:58:33 To start from chapter one of the manga. Don't listen. He's an idiot. Okay. Let's move on and last question
01:58:37 Now this guy actually asked a couple and they were all like full of pathos and were
01:58:43 Really god like I when you hear this you'll you'll know like where this guy was when he asked these questions
01:58:48 So this is a rato
01:58:51 Or uh
01:58:52 At intrepid feline. Okay. Here's the first question. How hard is it for you guys to meet new people?
01:58:58 And before we answer that let me just read his other questions
01:59:01 Next one. What advice do you guys give to trying to make friends?
01:59:06 And then the next one is how talkative are you guys outside of the podcast?
01:59:10 So I'm starting to get the kind of guy that this is and brother brother. I love you and I I want to legitimately
01:59:17 Answer these questions. So, um
01:59:19 Who wants to take any of those? I well I'll I will say that the reason we talk to each other
01:59:25 Is not because we're good at meeting new people. It's because we like the content that each other makes
01:59:30 Right. So that's that's one way to talk to people. It's just to be someone really good
01:59:35 That doing stuff. I mean if you're trying to if we're talking about on the internet
01:59:39 The best way to meet new people is just like hey, I love your work or uh something
01:59:44 You know or just like go just go to any community anywhere and find someone who has similar interest to you and talk to them
01:59:50 I think making friends on the internet is like a dime a dozen. You can easily do it
01:59:54 It's just about having literally anything to talk about
01:59:57 I don't think this guy needs internet friends though. I mean based on these questions. I can tell this is a lonely individual
02:00:03 I got the sense it was more about you know, like making real friends or human connections in which case you are barking up the
02:00:09 Absolute worst tree you could be barking up at this situation
02:00:13 I haven't met a new person to be an expert
02:00:15 In years
02:00:18 The last like the only times I meet new people are either, you know online like either we meet them through
02:00:24 They're them being great like the last new person I met online is monkey, you know
02:00:28 Right made great videos got in contact with them slowly developed a sort of like hey test the waters
02:00:34 This guy seemed like our kind of guy. He does seem like our kind of guy
02:00:37 All right, let's drag him into the crew and now I've met him in real life. He came by my house cool guy, right?
02:00:42 um as for offline
02:00:44 I only ever meet people if
02:00:47 For some reason someone is assimilated into my friends friends and even then I don't hang out with my own friends anymore
02:00:53 So I've actually not not only have I not met a new person in years
02:00:57 I've actively repelled almost everyone I knew before so like now I'm at probably the least a number of friends
02:01:04 I've ever had is right now
02:01:07 So I just like to say I am in a similar situation right now
02:01:11 Tomorrow in fact I'm going to go to a local pub
02:01:15 Just to see how easy it is to to talk to new people
02:01:20 Meet real people that I can say I mean, it's not like I'm bad at talking
02:01:24 The only way you get good at talking is by you know practice
02:01:27 But the the the act of like going up to a person is completely different from knowing how to talk
02:01:32 As the conversation has got I've truly realized so it's it's it's really just um
02:01:37 I don't know just go into places where people are and eventually something might have I've realized how awful I am at like
02:01:44 Even wanting to talk to people because the other day my mom
02:01:48 My mom's a part of a school of rock program
02:01:51 And they were doing a show a live show at this bar called hot tune out the street for me and like
02:01:57 Basically everyone my mom knows was invited. I didn't know they were all going to be there
02:02:01 But like it was at a bar and so I was thinking hey
02:02:04 I can you know have a few drinks. Maybe I'll talk to someone. Maybe there'll be a girl
02:02:08 I could talk to who knows um, and I wore my fucking giant fur coat because it stands out in school
02:02:14 Alpha's peacocking dog peacocking peacocking in my in my big coat and I had like a glass of wine before going
02:02:20 But it wasn't enough to get me drunk
02:02:22 Unfortunately because I should have just gotten like sourced before I got there
02:02:26 But like I showed up and of course it's mostly my parents's friends and like everyone wanted to talk to me
02:02:31 I got tons of people like commenting on my jacket lots of people, you know my who know me
02:02:36 But I don't know them because you know they all know my work and stuff from from facebook
02:02:41 My parents share my shit all the time especially my raps
02:02:44 So I was getting a lot of questions about like my rap and stuff and I was just like yeah, uh-huh
02:02:48 Oh hi, you know like like actively deflecting everyone and like wanting nothing to do with anybody and I was just like
02:02:55 What am I doing? I just I don't even like like people are actively trying to connect with me
02:03:01 And I am just telling them to fuck off essentially in so many words
02:03:05 Um, so yeah, I am the last person to come through for advice on this. Hey rato. Hey rato
02:03:10 I mean okay much you go ahead go ahead. I'm the best person to come and do a task about this because
02:03:16 Okay, here's we have to understand. I'm the saint like like there is no like real life me
02:03:21 There is no other me. I am like this all the time
02:03:25 However, there is one there is one difference
02:03:28 If you meet me on the side of the street
02:03:30 Then you will realize and you observe my actions and you observe me in my natural habitat
02:03:35 You will learn the meaning of fear
02:03:38 Actually, you will learn the meaning of friendship and charitable actions because I am the nicest person in the entire
02:03:47 Fucking universe. Just just not for the kikes. That's all. You know, that's the one thing
02:03:52 As all the people in this call are right kikes and niggers, you know
02:03:56 Uh, I am like like like no matter even if you're just some random fucking normie
02:04:02 I will I will actively try to be your best fucking friend if I meet you in real life
02:04:07 Like like if you just bump into me or something you're like, oh, hey, I'm I'm a tourist here and redacted
02:04:13 Uh, do you uh, do you know how to fucking kill people? I'll be like, do I ever bro here?
02:04:20 I'm gonna be your dad now. We're gonna kill people together. That's what it's like
02:04:25 Um, well, you have to understand. Okay. Uh, not about me you you you who asking this just act like you're crazy
02:04:32 And act like you are unstable and if you do that people will come in and they will have to be your friend
02:04:38 Or else they'll be scared. They're gonna die or else. They'll be scared. You're gonna kill them
02:04:43 So if you just act like you're going to kill people then people will like you
02:04:48 Well said munchie
02:04:51 Let me I want to comment on this
02:04:55 I feel I feel your suffering here
02:04:57 I know what it's like to be to be lonely and want to make friends and and not be able to communicate very well
02:05:03 Uh, I was like that for a long time and still am in some ways. Um, so I just want you to know
02:05:10 it sounds like
02:05:12 I mean, I feel like I know you that you're a guy if you're watching this podcast
02:05:15 Uh, which clearly you are then I feel like you you fit into kind of this nerdy guy on the internet group
02:05:22 Probably doesn't socialize a lot. Uh, you know by your own volition or by your question
02:05:26 I'm inferring that you're not a very talkative person
02:05:29 I would just highly recommend that you just change your life in such ways and it doesn't have to be drastic
02:05:36 But just try to make changes in your life where you're around more people more of the time
02:05:40 Because really what you're talking about is grinding a skill set of communication
02:05:44 As and like meeting new people
02:05:47 So like just if you can
02:05:49 Try to make changes in your life that put you in contact with a lot of people so that you can you know
02:05:53 Kind of practice grind up your talking skills as fast as possible
02:05:57 And put you in contact with lots of people so that you as fast as possible will meet people that you find a kinship with and like
02:06:03 And I wouldn't really recommend like pursuing internet friendships that much because there's just as human beings
02:06:09 There's just such a there's just such a great benefit to having like contact with people physically and face to face
02:06:14 As opposed to talking online, which can you know cause all kinds of problems
02:06:18 So you know just try to get out there more and and make like small changes
02:06:24 Like go to the library and do your homework there instead of doing it in your room or something like that because you know
02:06:30 There will be people there
02:06:31 Maybe they'll say something and try to push yourself
02:06:33 Little by little to to say things that maybe you don't feel comfortable saying right now
02:06:37 Like maybe complimenting somebody or if someone's got a shirt with something that you like
02:06:41 Like if someone's wearing a fucking death note shirt, dude, get in there. Let him know that it's your favorite anime
02:06:46 You know, it's not a joke like that. That is why I wore
02:06:50 You know, I wore anime shirts my entire like young life and I I just looking back at myself
02:06:56 I know it was that so I would get people to comment on them so I could make friends and and that's a weird thing
02:07:02 People didn't so be the hero who does man. They want to be talked to about that if they're wearing them be empowered
02:07:06 I've never like really worn shirts with like logos and stuff on them because I just generally thought
02:07:12 That's tacky. I'll just wear a t-shirt that is a color. Yeah, and
02:07:16 Nobody comes up to me
02:07:17 But then that one time at brony con where I was wearing the sweet bro and hella jeff shirt a guy
02:07:22 Was playing as dave. Oh look to me
02:07:25 He was also very shy and I didn't really we didn't really approach each other
02:07:28 We were saying hey, you're wearing my stuff and I was like, yeah
02:07:32 my stuff
02:07:35 It was cool is like I'm with you, you know, I'd never really experienced that that much before to expand
02:07:39 That's kind of the magic of cons, you know shared experiences can bloom into friendships, you know to expand on that point
02:07:45 Like don't not just that you should go up and talk to other people if they're wearing something cool
02:07:49 But if someone talks to you make sure you like
02:07:54 That's true. Be prepared for
02:07:56 Because for me I I actually get it's shocking how much I get talked to when I'm out and how little I say in response
02:08:03 Because I'm always wearing something fucking weird something that attracts attention
02:08:07 I go around in a bathrobe and everywhere I go people are like, oh man, you look comfortable, you know
02:08:12 And it's like they're being like genuinely friendly and all I ever do is go like, uh, yeah, you know like
02:08:19 There's very few times that I that I actually go and like
02:08:23 Try to make that into a conversation. It's not hard to do
02:08:26 I all the time when I'm out because you know, I eat out like every day and I'll hear people having
02:08:34 I'll hear people having like just conversations all the time, you know
02:08:39 The other day I was at a at a Filipino restaurant
02:08:42 Someone came in and they're just you know, they're waiting for their food to be cooked
02:08:45 So they just strike up a conversation with the cashier and the two of them are just shooting the shit about whatever
02:08:50 And like if if you talk to someone like that, you know, you might
02:08:55 Become friends with them some, you know, maybe there'll be you'll realize that they're really fun to talk to you
02:09:00 You know, and I went up to the counter and I was standing there and the guy had the guy at the cash register
02:09:06 Who I'd just been listening to have this conversation with some, you know, just some guy
02:09:09 I'm looking and there's a 3ds right there with the majora's mask logo on it and I
02:09:15 And I'm thinking to myself
02:09:17 Just say
02:09:19 What are you playing?
02:09:21 You know, what game are you playing? What are you playing? And I kept thinking it and I didn't say anything and then just left
02:09:27 so
02:09:29 Be in that situation and say what game are you playing because you'll probably have a conversation about video games
02:09:36 And maybe you guys like the same video games
02:09:38 Maybe he wants to you know, give you his xbox gamer tag and you guys can fucking play games together and become friends
02:09:44 And then remember that you live in the same town and you can actually go hang out with them, you know
02:09:48 That's what this is. It's constantly be kind of putting out little
02:09:53 Little constantly be extending little olive branches to people or little, you know friendship offerings
02:09:58 And because eventually someone will take it up, you know
02:10:01 Like I mean the the problem with me and a lot of people like me like being shy is that you think about all these things
02:10:08 You know, you try you go to a place where there are people but you don't end up saying anything you just think
02:10:13 Oh, but what if it doesn't work? It's always about like being
02:10:17 Being prepared to look like a complete idiot. I think is the most important thing for for people
02:10:23 It's just like you know that it's not going to be that bad
02:10:26 But you're thinking it is going to be terrible
02:10:28 Well, and you just got to be you got to be prepared for it to be the worst thing that could ever happen
02:10:33 And like listen like I recommend listening to other people's conversations because when you do so what you'll quickly realize is that
02:10:39 Everything everyone talks about is vapid and retarded and nothing you will say is going to sound dumb
02:10:45 Because everything everyone talks about is totally stupid
02:10:48 Like people just get you know, like that guy having the conversation at the counter. It's just like, you know
02:10:52 Oh, yeah, uh, you know, well this trump guy whoo-ho like yep. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, you know like not even saying words
02:11:00 Just like just emitting sounds from your mouth is enough. It's just about the human connection
02:11:04 They're not having a conversation that's meaningful or interesting
02:11:08 They just want to i'm sitting in a place with another human. Let's you know make it not quiet in here
02:11:15 Like that's all people want you don't have to come on
02:11:17 You don't have to be a charming cool smart funny guy
02:11:20 You just have to be willing to talk and you've you're in you know
02:11:25 Just about togetherness and and feeling like you're in the part of the same community as one another
02:11:29 It's so I just want to leave you with with like an action plan here
02:11:33 Just try to change your life a little bit so that you go out in public
02:11:37 There are people that you could theoretically talk to around you
02:11:41 Uh, and and you know try to make some effort to uh
02:11:45 To reach out to them in in whatever small way that that you can and this I want to emphasize this really is a skill set
02:11:50 So like they were saying it's not going to go perfectly at first
02:11:53 But don't worry about it. Just think about how you're improving and it will lead to better things later on
02:11:57 You gotta grind those rpg stats, bro. That's exactly the way I think about it. You know doing this shit
02:12:03 Uh, just try and hopefully that was helpful and be cool and exactly what already are
