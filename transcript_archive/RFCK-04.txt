00:00:00 By the way, whenever I look at this, I think it says E-Fuck, and I don't know why.
00:00:04 Yeah, dirt cheap E-Fuck.
00:00:12 Alright, I guess we can start at any time. Talking about the Nintendo Switch.
00:00:18 Hey everyone, welcome to episode whatever of Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers.
00:00:23 I believe it's the fifth?
00:00:25 Yeah, I think so too. It's just me and Munchy here.
00:00:30 We don't need any other people. They always mess everything up. They always bring their gay shit in here.
00:00:35 They always keep talking about how they're migtails and they love to rape women.
00:00:39 Yeah, and frankly, it's offensive and I won't stand for it.
00:00:45 We are the most blue-pilled people on the face of the planet.
00:00:50 I just eat blue pills for breakfast cereal. I have a big box of them.
00:00:55 Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and dessert are all comprised mainly of blue pills.
00:01:02 I have not once entered a single red pill in my body and I never did.
00:01:07 If I ever did, I would cut off my hand in penance.
00:01:10 Anyway, me and Munchy hate video games.
00:01:14 More than a human could even describe, I think we are completely fed up with the idea of interacting with media in any meaningful way.
00:01:20 Like, it's not even real, man. It's just pixels on the screen.
00:01:25 Yeah, it's not even, it's not, it has no bearing reality. It's all gay shit.
00:01:30 Nintendo hasn't made any good games since they made...
00:01:35 I think you're...
00:01:37 ...Mariochic is typing.
00:01:40 And how can video games be real?
00:01:42 If our eyes aren't real.
00:01:44 That's all I'm saying.
00:01:45 Okay, I think to say we both love that presentation and it was great.
00:01:49 Oh yeah, we just watched the Nintendo Switch presentation.
00:01:52 Yeah, and it was...
00:01:53 It was really cool and pretty good.
00:01:56 And I loved it. And we love video games.
00:01:59 And we are the most red-pilled people on the face of the planet when it comes to video games.
00:02:03 If I had $299.99 burning a hole in my pocket, would I get a Switch?
00:02:09 Honestly, maybe.
00:02:10 Yes.
00:02:11 Because video games...
00:02:13 I think might redeem themselves.
00:02:15 Yeah, video games have caused so much violence in the streets.
00:02:19 Racial tensions are at an all-time high due to video games such as Splatoon.
00:02:23 Yeah, because video games have gone off the fray.
00:02:26 Video games have been getting people to Pokemon Go to the polls lately.
00:02:29 We need video games like the Nintendo Switch to get us to Pokemon Get Away from those polls.
00:02:36 Stay inside.
00:02:37 Don't talk to people and please, please consider suicide.
00:02:41 Unless you're going to your platonic best friend's home for an evening of Ice Breakers with Switch...
00:02:48 One-two Switch made by Nintendo, Reggie Philamy.
00:02:52 Anyway, what games did we just see?
00:02:56 We just saw...
00:02:57 Well, first of all, I have a bunch of notes here.
00:03:00 Okay.
00:03:01 And we should start from where the presentation starts, which is the hardware.
00:03:04 Okay, yeah, we start with the hardware.
00:03:06 My first note is I've got something to dock for you.
00:03:10 The Nintendo Switch is a DS, but not at all.
00:03:16 And you charge it by putting it on a little thing, and then you use controllers and you play the games.
00:03:22 It's a DS...
00:03:24 It's a DS...
00:03:25 It's a DS 3DS Wii U.
00:03:30 That's it.
00:03:31 Yeah.
00:03:32 It's those two things.
00:03:33 It went on extended period of time about how it has D&A from every game system.
00:03:37 But really just like two and a half?
00:03:39 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:40 Just like the last couple that were good?
00:03:42 Yeah, the last couple.
00:03:43 The Gamecube has a handle on it.
00:03:46 It doesn't fucking care.
00:03:47 What?
00:03:48 Yeah.
00:03:49 Stupid.
00:03:50 Gamecube's the best system in the game, however.
00:03:52 However is the best game system.
00:03:55 In spite of its crippling handle.
00:03:57 Yeah.
00:03:58 I don't even know if the thing had a handle.
00:04:01 It's bizarre now that I think of it.
00:04:02 I use it all the time, honestly.
00:04:03 When I went to go play melee with some bros.
00:04:05 Dude, that's sick dude!
00:04:07 Jack off, Jack off, Jack off!
00:04:09 I'm picturing like...
00:04:12 Okay.
00:04:13 It's the heart of Tokyo, right?
00:04:17 Yes.
00:04:18 And it's 9am or 8am or 6am.
00:04:22 I don't fucking know.
00:04:23 It's when people...
00:04:24 All the Japanese businessmen are all making their morning commute.
00:04:27 And they're all sitting there on the subway holding the subway poles.
00:04:30 You know, the camera pans across the road.
00:04:32 All, you know, all heights, sizes, ages.
00:04:34 It's all these men, all these big towel men.
00:04:37 Just holding their briefcases.
00:04:38 These important stuffy briefcases.
00:04:40 Checking their watches.
00:04:41 Pan too munchy and his pizza onesie.
00:04:43 Holding his Gamecube like a suitcase.
00:04:46 Checking his watch that he isn't wearing.
00:04:48 Looking out the window.
00:04:50 That is drawn on with Sharpie.
00:04:52 As I do every morning.
00:04:54 Every, and every, and every number says...
00:04:59 Burger.
00:05:00 One.
00:05:01 One.
00:05:02 Every number says one.
00:05:03 It's always one.
00:05:04 Well audience, guess what time it is.
00:05:06 I guess it's time to...

00:06:28 One.
00:06:29 One.
00:06:30 One.
00:06:31 One.
00:06:32 It does look janky and they aren't much far apart than any other
00:06:37 Controller, but that is normally where they are placed in the sense that like there's one out like north and one south
00:06:43 Wait, is the 3ds kind of like that? Does it have like two joysticks like that?
00:06:46 Well the the the there's like a proof
00:06:50 Okay
00:06:51 The fucking what are they called the joycon the joycon are tiny
00:06:55 They're very they're tiny and also to you're supposed to like you have that like top slider on that gives them
00:07:02 The the shoulder buttons, yeah, which is even tinier and there's so many fucking moving parts
00:07:07 Yeah, there's so many little things it is very small and very vulgar and very
00:07:12 Complex such as another man that I know named Ben saying small vulgar
00:07:19 Yeah, all these fucking parts. I'm not I don't care that like I don't think I would if I had a Nintendo switch
00:07:25 I don't think I would lose these parts, but I do know I would be I do think that I would be frustrated every single time
00:07:30 I had to like find the like the shoulder buttons and like slide it onto my joycon
00:07:36 I'm not worried about that what I'm worried about is I have big fucking hand come on man
00:07:40 Yeah, and it would be I I think I held it
00:07:44 Obviously, but I think it would be very uncomfortable in my hands be very close together because I oh I already feel that way slightly
00:07:50 With the gamecube control and if it were any smaller than that
00:07:53 I think it would be a bit excessive not to be racist no racism
00:07:56 But I think it's it's because of your race and die
00:08:01 I was gonna say that like I think that it's designed for like Japanese hands, right?
00:08:07 Oh, that is exactly why it is like yeah, it's small for Japanese hands Japanese people are
00:08:14 Categorically smaller than other races. That's not in the physics team. Well, I think so I because I find the truth offensive
00:08:21 We as a poor we are the most blue pill people
00:08:29 Get away from me man, I don't want to hear a single fucking thing about that. All right
00:08:34 I don't want to hear but Japanese people are getting my entire fucking blire. No, I've seen I've seen too many of them
00:08:41 Yeah, in this in this in this last hour
00:08:44 It's coming out in two months. Yeah, it will be here sooner than my cum leaves my body
00:08:51 I hope so
00:08:54 And all right, what else about the hardware? Um, I find it weird. I
00:09:01 I mean, what's what's the deal with like so like all the games that it plays have to be
00:09:07 Runnable on like portable hardware
00:09:10 Yeah, so that's weird. That seems like it's really limiting
00:09:14 They put a lot of effort into like because that seems like there's a lot of games then that won't
00:09:20 Like like like I mean already like the Wii and the Wii U are not like hard. They're not
00:09:26 Powerful like the PlayStation whatever in the Xbox whatever are so I guess that's probably fine and they're and they're okay with the sacrifice
00:09:32 You still though that means that like anything you're playing on your Nintendo Switch is something that you should you would expect to be playing on
00:09:39 Something the size of like an intended like a 3ds. Okay. Yes, but have you seen how those games look? Yeah, they look great
00:09:47 I guess I guess we're getting to that point where that's not even that big a deal
00:09:49 Yeah, yeah, no
00:09:51 Because the 3ds the original 3ds was in between the Nintendo 64 and the game
00:09:57 graphics wise, yeah
00:09:59 And I like and due to the fact that they are going out from the outside to make this both a
00:10:05 Home and a handheld system. They're gonna put a lot of fucking effort into like min maxing where everything should go and it's
00:10:13 Maximizes
00:10:18 It basically just looks like the Wii U, but I don't care
00:10:23 No, I know that I should grab her, but I don't I don't care at all
00:10:28 Yeah, I think you'll agree with me the graphical fidelity isn't the end all be all
00:10:33 There's way more important things in making good games not not to say that visuals don't matter visuals better a lot
00:10:39 Yeah, art styling themes and gay shit that I don't I I hate everyone
00:10:47 Japanese people the most
00:10:50 Yeah, because they made Nintendo. Yeah, Nintendo
00:10:53 More like and they've trapped us in the vicious cycle of video game consoles
00:10:59 Which is the hell that you can never wake up from?
00:11:02 Most definitely most definitely that is the case. What was it saying?
00:11:07 Wait 3d hardware small hardware portable hardware visual fidelity. Yeah. Yeah, we're just saying that
00:11:14 It doesn't have to look hd necessary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I won't disagree. It looks nice, but it's definitely it's not
00:11:23 important
00:11:24 Yeah, yeah, I think yeah, the hardware is good enough. Yeah, portable
00:11:28 Yeah, that's something it's good
00:11:32 So so you don't think do you think it will be a visual downgraded from the Wii U? No, no, it's an upgrade. It's a straight up
00:11:38 Holy shit. Yeah, it's impressive. I guess the Wii U is pretty small
00:11:42 Yeah, it is like the actual console itself. I have no doubt it will be heavy
00:11:47 Which I think will hurt it a little bit in the sense that we normally just won't want to lug it around. Yeah, look
00:11:52 Yeah, lugging
00:11:53 Yeah lugging the equivalent of a Wii U around and playing it like on the subway then again
00:11:59 It is much leaner though. I get the impression that is leaner, but bigger
00:12:03 How much how much is a 3ds cost a 3ds was originally 250. I believe and now it's a hundred and fifty
00:12:10 Oh shit. So like so like the switch isn't even that much more expensive. No, that's another note of mine
00:12:17 $300 to fuck off
00:12:19 What do you mean?
00:12:20 We pay fun $350 at $300. Sorry. Yeah, and we can fuck off after that
00:12:27 Are you saying that's good or bad? I'm I don't know what I mean
00:12:32 I mean, I think it sounds like an okay price point. No. No. Yeah, it's definitely it. Okay. I'm fine with it
00:12:38 Do you remember when like weeds were like a hundred dollars? Yeah. Yeah, it was recent like I mean, what are they now Obama like nothing
00:12:48 Yeah, well like original we know her like fucking paper. They're toilet paper. You can pack you you use them as packing peanuts. Yeah
00:12:56 Very hard packing peanuts. Yeah
00:13:01 Really not not advised however, it is but it is economically viable
00:13:08 I guess I was totally true that certain dollars to fuck off because there's online paid
00:13:13 Oh, yeah, the pay online is such it's so shit. Yeah
00:13:17 That seems that doesn't seem like a Nintendo move to make like a play online service a pay-to-play thing
00:13:22 That's weird. It's never been like no, it hasn't why would they do that?
00:13:26 You know, it's gonna make I mean, I'm not gonna buy it when it comes out
00:13:30 But it would make me mad to like you get the console and the online service is free
00:13:37 And then suddenly it's not yeah, you like you lose that functionality. Yeah, that's that's shitty
00:13:42 I don't like it. I don't like it. It is it is definitely shitty
00:13:46 the only reason they could possibly be doing this is because
00:13:50 No one likes Nintendo online and they want to it like they want to improve its quality
00:13:55 And therefore they must focus on it more and therefore they deserve like they they want money for
00:14:00 They want money for the fact that they will now care about online. That's the only that's the only reason I can
00:14:07 Meet me that's not to say that I think it will be good because I have no like they have never done good online and any capacity whatsoever
00:14:14 God
00:14:15 Fucking the festival Plaza and Sun and Moon is so terrible. Yeah, it is worse thing ever
00:14:20 It doesn't even fucking work. It is so hard. Yeah to do it. Yeah. Oh
00:14:26 It's
00:14:29 Fuck Rick you you gosh dang Japanese people. Yeah, man
00:14:35 What were they thinking they must you know, they must have just not cared because they can all quick connect with each other and they're tiny island nation
00:14:41 Because they're all literally like on top of each other. Yeah, 100% of the reason they're so small is because there's not enough space to walk around
00:14:50 You have to be they're involved. They're they're they're evolving into oh, you mean the people. Yeah, I thought you meant the hard way
00:14:56 No, the boat. Yeah, yeah, but the one feeds into the yes, they're both shrinking
00:15:02 They're both game video games are shrinking and therefore they must shrink to play video games. That's all
00:15:08 People get smaller
00:15:10 The selective evolution of people have to get smaller to adapt to the new video game
00:15:18 Oh my god, this is like in this is cycles of every like five years or so the people
00:15:22 This is smaller and smaller to adapt to the new video game rapid evolution unlike anything else we've ever observed the Japanese in the video game are truly
00:15:30 What's the word this is why I mean, you know the thing about like like Japanese elderly people are like really small and hunched over
00:15:39 Yeah, because they had to adapt too many times because the video games just they just wore them out
00:15:44 This is why I see a video games are destroying Japan in more ways
00:15:49 And now it's bleeding over
00:15:53 Destruction when will it ends?
00:15:55 Well, it's a good thing you're talking about other
00:15:58 Hey, it's Jesse
00:16:05 Rowdy fuck
00:16:13 I don't fucking know I came up with it and I really don't like
00:16:17 I
00:16:22 Came up with it, isn't that you're very fond of
00:16:25 My next oh
00:16:27 Jesse have you seen the Nintendo switch?
00:16:31 He's given through completely. Well, he didn't skip through like 80% of it was hot garbage. Yeah. Well, I was pretty
00:16:39 pleased with the games generally I
00:16:42 Don't really give a fuck about Splatoon. Everybody like that. I love splatoon. Yeah, we're gonna use
00:16:47 Plagueons, you know, I have notes that will guide us through
00:16:53 Oh
00:16:54 If I got if I got a we a switch
00:16:58 Splatoon would be my top my top. Well, unless I wanted to try out arms
00:17:02 We should have said this at the beginning. This is crucial. My dick leans to the left. Does that happen to anyone else?
00:17:07 Or should I ask the doctor about that?
00:17:08 No, it's normal. Everyone's everyone's leans and everyone's bad
00:17:12 Okay, every dick is horrible in its own way, but vaginas are way worse
00:17:16 We can all we can all agree that the giant every vagina is horrible in the same way
00:17:21 Well, but join us are like evil. Yeah, but a dick is a sin. Yeah, I agree like vaginas commit dicks
00:17:31 Like genocide, right?
00:17:33 Oh
00:17:55 Fuck okay, okay. Have we said everything about the hardware? No, there's still more
00:18:00 My next note no region locking you fucking cunt. That's good. Yeah, they're not region locking. Yeah, it's great
00:18:06 Why would they never why isn't it hasn't it always been why why is region locking a video game?
00:18:12 Yeah, it's the worst video game ever made. I mean, I don't understand why it ever was ever
00:18:17 But like in the modern era of
00:18:20 Gaming it's especially baffling that it was that it needs still around to be removed second that I've never been able to play my
00:18:30 Evangelion Dating Sim
00:18:33 And they've just been sitting on my shelf, and I'll never know their glory
00:18:36 You probably you probably have to like take out the PS the PlayStation motherboard and like put a spring on the reset button
00:18:44 Or something and it'd be easier to build
00:18:48 Truly
00:18:50 Yeah, I think I think all we have to say is that's just sick. Yeah, it's pretty good
00:18:55 It's good, but I'm not gonna praise them for it because it's the base. It's baseline
00:18:59 Yeah, yeah, you're right. Nate was talking about this as well
00:19:02 It's not something we should like yeah, like they should have done this in the first place
00:19:06 It's not something to get all perceived. Yeah, that's not the right way. Yes. I have a note
00:19:11 I don't know what it means Fabio edits entertaining DNA
00:19:17 Go on. That's it. No, what do you think Jesse is that like they could be a game
00:19:22 Is that the truth that that is the that if anything is a red pill in documentary
00:19:27 That's not like a documentary. That'd be like a high fantasy adventure game. Yeah based on like Fabio romance novel
00:19:35 Yes procedurally generated to resemble just based on all the different elements of romance
00:19:41 Weaving a tapestry of continuity between all these disparate covers of these novels
00:19:46 You play as a as a Buxom wench
00:19:49 Whose bodice is ever on the cusp of ripping
00:19:54 You play as Fabio on your love quest across the nine realms
00:19:59 Which includes San Diego, Chicago
00:20:05 Everyone knows the nine realms
00:20:08 New York City Toronto
00:20:12 And Rio de Janeiro
00:20:15 Toronto is the final boss
00:20:18 The women are so Muslim. It's hard to even walk
00:20:24 You have to go and reform it
00:20:26 Curit curits plague
00:20:28 This this is something we're gonna get married to their boats, right? No, no, no
00:20:32 Do does anyone agree with the with my opinion that handhelds are better than home consoles? Um
00:20:39 Um
00:20:41 But the Splatoon wait Splatoon is on the 3ds wasn't it? No, not at all
00:20:50 I mean, I'm actually I'm not really I completely understand home consoles and I like them just fine
00:20:57 However, I like the idea of like I like to always be at my computer
00:21:02 So the fact that I can just use like a DS while I'm at the computer is
00:21:06 very appealing
00:21:08 But then you're not really you're not using your computer
00:21:11 I mean couldn't you just have a home console right next to your computer wouldn't it be like the same thing?
00:21:15 I guess so, but I can also like walk around and I can also go to the bathroom
00:21:19 I can also you know do all the shit that a normal need does a normal need a good need
00:21:26 Like like every good boy should
00:21:30 It's um
00:21:32 But see what this is the best of both worlds because you can be gay and I can be gay and we can all suck each other's dick
00:21:37 Hang on. I've lost track of the conversation
00:21:40 Then into a switch this whole gimmick is it's a home console and a and no
00:21:45 Yeah, and it's you know what I think I just have a psychological bias against taking my home console on the road
00:21:52 Even though it costs like barely more than a 3ds would but I would still feel really weird like
00:21:57 Plants like the guy in the trailer like playing Skyrim and then picking up my Skyrim machine taking Skyrim on the bus with me
00:22:04 Maybe if I tried it, I would get over it real quick. It seems weird. I would definitely
00:22:09 Like not use it in the situation of that that that hideous monster uses
00:22:16 The boy the boy on the trailer that there's like this guy in like a trailer and he like looks like a normal human
00:22:23 He looks like he looks like a normal will just a human and therefore
00:22:34 Yes, yes, I understand. I mean
00:22:37 Yeah, I don't yeah, I don't get it either
00:22:39 It's like yeah, you play it up if you have like an hour long commute or something on the subway
00:22:43 I think so but like most people don't commute
00:22:47 You like you'd be like in like little five minute increments like oh getting on the bus getting sitting on the bus getting off the bus
00:22:52 Walking down the street. I
00:22:55 Like to flip out my DS if I ever go to say a restaurant alone
00:23:00 When I'm when I'm I can't spend time with my friends like I want to and I decide like well
00:23:05 I might as well just play a video game so I can remind myself
00:23:08 Well, I can lead myself in the thinking that people like me like I don't I don't need a video game to fill like
00:23:15 Little like five or ten or fifteen minutes. Well, I'm saying if I go into a fucking restaurant
00:23:21 Yeah, like like like while I'm waiting to eat. I'll play the game
00:23:25 I'm going if I if I had a yeah
00:23:29 If yeah, if I had a console a three-hand hill console, yeah
00:23:35 I like I like I'm one of those people who likes is like I'm going to play a video game
00:23:41 Yeah, you know, but I get but I guess I don't know
00:23:43 I guess I'm one of these guys who I like I like
00:23:47 Narrative and I like immersion and I like to get lost in a thing
00:23:51 I don't think I've ever been immersed in anything in my entire life
00:23:55 You and did you both think that and I'm like I get immersed man
00:23:59 That's what I'm looking for when I play a game is to like be have a fun
00:24:07 But the closest thing I've ever been to him probably immerse myself in is rape play because I emphasize so much with the main character
00:24:13 Is that the one where you're like a god and you have like powers to like blow the girls skirts up?
00:24:18 No, no, I think no, well, it's the one where you rape a mother and then her daughter on a Japanese
00:24:24 I'm pretty sure that's the one. I'm thinking. Okay. I'm pretty sure I've done that scenario so many times
00:24:30 My life is basically like rape in every way and
00:24:34 I'm Japanese. Where did the video games end and reality begin?
00:24:39 With digs predicts prediction
00:24:41 The world will become more like a video game and video games will more and more resemble the real world until the two are
00:24:46 Functionally inseparable
00:24:48 Yes, yes, especially in Japan. Well, I already that way in Japan. Can I eat vagina as Crash Bandicoot?
00:24:57 Not yet. Well in the future one day. I can't wait until all law
00:25:03 Reverse to like a Grand Theft Auto five-star system
00:25:08 Like I can rate like as long as I rate under seven people it'll stay under two stars
00:25:13 You can still like hide in an alleyway for five seconds
00:25:19 That ties into our hatred of cost statute of limitations is like 30 seconds to five minutes depending on the severity of the event
00:25:31 Yes, I completely agree
00:25:39 Home screen there were like three frames of it
00:25:44 Nintendo
00:25:45 I
00:25:46 Don't have any of you play the original BS. I had one
00:25:50 It does home screens better than any other fucking thing because it it takes like three seconds to get
00:25:56 It's just like a button, right? Yeah, just you just think yeah
00:25:59 It's like like you turn on it like the big button is like the game. Yeah, you hit the game and then the game
00:26:03 Yes, I it's the best of both worlds because I like game
00:26:07 I like old systems because you can just turn it on in the games there
00:26:11 The fact that you can just do more with video game
00:26:15 And you can like download games and shit
00:26:18 You know, I don't think I agree. I wish that we didn't need a home screen because like yeah
00:26:24 I currently I need the home screen in order to configure all my shit in order to make say the festival plaza and Pokemon Sun
00:26:31 Actually work because I need to like add people's friend codes. I wish we didn't need that. I wish I wish I wish it wasn't
00:26:39 This way
00:26:41 I just like having app like like various applications on my 3ds
00:26:47 But I never do anything but the game
00:26:49 I do agree that it needs to be downplayed as it was with the DS and it looked very similar to the DS
00:26:55 It's like it was just like like big squares and the first one you're on is like Mario
00:27:01 It's isn't it fucked that the 3ds like you open it up and there's all these like 20 buttons
00:27:07 Yeah, and like one of them is the game and it's like no bigger or more prominent than any of the other
00:27:12 Yeah, it's just what one of the many many helpful functions of your 3ds includes playing a video game. Yes. Yes
00:27:18 I I can really agree. Yeah, and I
00:27:22 Everything I've gone from from the way the hardware looks to the the way the the software you want to come in man
00:27:29 Recording
00:27:37 Bye
00:27:39 Thanks for stopping by I'm rowdy fuckers cop killer
00:27:43 Yeah
00:27:44 Ham boys and boys. All right. Oh, yeah, it looks like home screen. Yeah
00:27:49 Everything looks like it looks very modern. Nintendo doesn't make anything look fucking good
00:27:54 They can't make hardware or home menus look good
00:27:57 They just can't but now they can because I'm assuming they have like like like phone app developers to help them
00:28:04 They probably poached a bunch of Apple dudes
00:28:08 Yeah, yeah, and now they're and now they're caught up to the modern world because they're channeling the ghost of Steve Jobs
00:28:14 Who is gay? He's my favorite original character is the ghost of Steve Jobs
00:28:18 My favorite original character is the the skeleton
00:28:25 He doesn't have he only has one skeleton in his closet the man is in a doozy
00:28:34 You haven't even talked about the games yet. No, I'm there's a point
00:28:38 home screen the home screen
00:28:41 fucking
00:28:44 The way you is the worst game system ever made it looks like shit
00:28:48 Everything about it is shit and and the game pad itself. It's not the most uncomfortable
00:28:53 Disgusting the heaviest thing. I hate the game the game pad or whatever you call it. Yeah, the game
00:28:59 Like when it's fucking time to play a video game everyone wants to not use that. Yeah. Yeah
00:29:04 No, I don't want to be saddled with this burden. Yeah, it's the worst thing ever, but the switch
00:29:10 Does look good. I think it looks it looks like it looks comfortable
00:29:15 Yeah, well other than the fact that the controllers look like fucking tiny and like little toys and stuff
00:29:21 Maybe I could maybe if I held maybe I could get over there. Maybe it's maybe it wouldn't be as bad
00:29:25 Yeah, I think holding it in our hands. We would I think it will be bigger than over than what we're thinking
00:29:32 I do think it will be small
00:29:35 That's not how they aren't atoms better play. I'm playing the world's smallest video games you guys
00:29:42 This is an audio show. This is an individual show. They wouldn't understand that at all
00:29:45 I'm holding my fingers exactly together and rubbing them. It's like like the world's smallest violin. Yeah. Yeah, okay
00:29:51 Got it. Got it. Okay. Uh made for Japs very small. Oh, we've been over that. Yes, uh Fakie
00:29:57 Wada's gay the the presentation about it written in itself the presenters were a real wacky cast
00:30:04 I mean my my favorite one has to be the guy who comes up looking like this fucking this like he's like a
00:30:12 late 40s
00:30:14 Buzz-Cutted guy in like this kind of like pointy-looking tuxedo with like yeah
00:30:20 We have like a big like silver key
00:30:22 And he's and he shows up he shows up looking like some kind of Kingdom Hearts villain
00:30:28 Says something and then goes away with no consequences
00:30:33 He says like Sega makes video games. Bye. Oh, no
00:30:37 He what stuck out to me about it is that he phrased it in terms of himself
00:30:41 Yeah, as a game creator like as an individual creator and I have no idea who yes, was he a Sega guy?
00:30:48 Yeah, yeah, he was second. All right. Well, he's clearly him. He's clearly in nefarious
00:30:57 I was like this is a villain that I'm seeing here
00:30:59 This guy's gonna come back in chapter three and he's gonna fuck shit up things gonna be going really good for our main character Mario
00:31:06 Yeah, this guy is just gonna yeah, he's gonna flip the script on it. He's off the wall. Yeah
00:31:10 We're
00:31:13 Yeah, rowdy fuckers rowdy fuckers. Well, what was incredibly boring? Huh? No
00:31:22 Okay, um
00:31:23 Jesse remember remember that one guy from the presentation who was like dressed in a black tuxedo with a big silver key chain
00:31:29 And he has like he was like a head like squirt of like kind of a mohawk a little bit
00:31:36 He was just some I don't know he was he was just like this evil looking guy
00:31:40 He looked like a second guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He looked like a monster. Yeah. Yes
00:31:45 He looked like a Kingdom Hearts villain. Yeah, that's what I thought
00:31:48 And then there was there was the guy the guys like let's switch over to this person and the guy comes in and he's like yeah
00:31:56 Oh, oh, right. Yeah, cuz he's talking. He's had a Travis touchdown. Yeah. Was that was that Suda of
00:32:02 51 oh
00:32:04 He comes out like yeah, oh that didn't go over there
00:32:07 But then he ends it with another yeah, which also doesn't go over the dub of that man in particular was the funniest thing
00:32:14 I've ever seen in my entire fucking life. He starts taught. He's like talking in Japanese
00:32:21 And the and the translation translators just like
00:32:26 Video games in this in this area. I don't think that translator actually speaks any Japanese
00:32:32 I think he just like he had like a made his best guess like a weird like sitcom day where he stumbled into that job
00:32:39 Like fill in for somebody
00:32:41 That there is ours got one point where I swear like the guy had been talking a fucking mile a minute
00:32:46 And then like like I like one minute later
00:32:48 You can like hear him like actually like knock his mic over like oh, oh, yes
00:32:53 video games and
00:32:54 Shit, I mean I could not repeat to you anything
00:32:57 He mentioned a Travis touchdown and he likes indie games, I guess yeah, I think we scooped over it
00:33:04 Well, when me and Jess were watching it with Victor, however, we went to extensive detail about the weird ice cube Arctic scene
00:33:11 Oh when he's like shaking the ice
00:33:15 Where it's supposed to I don't buy it
00:33:19 Looks really cool. Yeah, even though I can't
00:33:22 Imagine it. Do you know what it was saying? Yeah, but it has like some kind of like haptic feedback thing
00:33:27 Yeah, it has HD rumble capabilities
00:33:30 What yeah, which is like which is like high definition rumble which means like nothing
00:33:35 Well, I think well what it seemed to be suggesting was that like the rumble
00:33:40 Functionality is like it's not it's like it's like it has like
00:33:44 Spatial qualities to it like it occurred like in different places in the remote depending on like
00:33:50 What the object is supposed to be which I don't think there's any fucking reason for that
00:33:55 No, I don't mind it. I don't mind it at all. But what the fuck are they good?
00:34:01 Yeah, like what what is the purpose of this like I mean I like I like rumble
00:34:07 Yeah, like when when when whenever rumbles happening, it's like an explosion, right? Like something fucking crazy is happening
00:34:13 Yeah, and so there's no like there's there's never gonna be a point where an explosion is happening
00:34:18 Directly on like like on my left side only well if if they somehow crafted a gameplay
00:34:25 experience that like really made use of like this HD rumble
00:34:31 I think it could be pretty neat
00:34:34 Fucking sick nasty. Yeah, so I'm for it. Also. There was like a rock-paper-scissors section. Oh, yeah
00:34:40 Like how the Wiimote like sensor bar thing it recognizes the shape of objects and the examples
00:34:47 They gave were rock-paper-scissors with your hands. Yes, which is pretty neat. Uh, I
00:34:51 Feel like that's far more practical
00:34:54 Even though I have no idea what it would be used for I mean, I'll tell you what it's gonna be useful
00:34:59 It's gonna be used so you can do your favorite shadow clone jutsu is in our in Naruto fight
00:35:04 Never mind the best game system. Yeah
00:35:08 And so I can do my various game symbols
00:35:10 Yeah, and not look like in retard except I still will and the game will know I'm a retard when you start up
00:35:17 50 cent blood on the sand to 50 cent
00:35:20 51 cents when you start the official Wu Tang
00:35:23 License video game
00:35:25 Then you will you three you throw up your your chosen gang sign that the game
00:35:29 You know hopefully shows you how to make and then your character just like whoosh you become outfitted you become black in real life
00:35:36 It's kind of like Final Fantasy 10 to we're like the dress orbs like change your class
00:35:40 You throw up a different gang sign and then you get like new abilities based on what gang you're a part of um, I know
00:35:46 everything about gang culture
00:35:50 You look like it Ben you really look like an expert on gang culture. I'm an expert on what the fuck I'm talking about right now
00:35:58 Now let's actually talk about the fucking video games
00:36:01 One-two switch. I just I think did you try it as WarioWare for normies?
00:36:07 Yeah, one-two switch is not a video game making it the best video game of all time
00:36:13 You don't look at the screen the whole gimmick is that you look into the other person's eyes
00:36:16 And it's a various set of mini games that you are like you're you're first instructed by the screen and then like
00:36:22 I guess you look into their eyes and then you just sense out when to do button presses. I guess I think it's cool
00:36:28 I think it's cool. I don't think it's fucking gay. Yeah. Well, it's it's not a video game
00:36:33 It is quite. It's kind of it's just it's like a video game icebreaker thing. Yeah
00:36:39 It's for normies is the most normie video game ever produced
00:36:43 Yeah, like it's it's just like the game itself is just there to keep score while you and your buddies like you know play charades and like
00:36:50 With your dick sound do a sword fight. Yeah, you know do quick quick draw things or whatever and play times with each other
00:36:56 And I'm all and I'm all for it. You know, I just sound very negative just then I think I think it's a okay
00:37:01 I think I would I wouldn't buy it ever, but you know what?
00:37:08 One-two switch the first game
00:37:16 But you can shoot each other
00:37:20 Don't you understand you play the game by looking into each other's eyes a note that I have for this is face-to-face actual real life death
00:37:28 The gimmick
00:37:34 Okay, now let's move on from the gayest game ever to the gayest game ever punch out shit arms looks cool cool
00:37:41 It's okay. Yes, and it's awesome. You don't think it looks like
00:37:46 Retarded all retarded baby shit
00:37:59 Well, it looks like a really great time
00:38:04 No, I thought it looked really neat and
00:38:07 Notice how when they showed the gameplay of it. They just showed the gameplay
00:38:11 They didn't show the guys actually playing with it because they're not gonna look like they're doing stuff
00:38:17 No, you're playing it. You're just gonna go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're just gonna be making little like put
00:38:21 But I'm making very minor gestures with my hands. I don't get it
00:38:25 I don't go where they can't just make video games why they have to make a bunch of bullshit
00:38:28 I will agree the motion controls very severely will probably damage
00:38:34 However, yeah, you know what I like I like the idea like like he like the guy on
00:38:40 Presentation described it as like boxing you have to use you have to you have to punch
00:38:43 But it's like shooting you have to adjust where your opponent will be. I think yeah
00:38:47 I think it's a very good game idea the idea of like
00:38:52 Flicking the thing to punch and then turning to like adjust the trajectory of your punch seems pretty neat
00:38:57 And if it felt good, I think it could be because it's not it's not gonna be like that
00:39:01 It's gonna be like like that. Yeah, like like the trailer has these guys actually throwing like full-body punches as though
00:39:07 Like it actually controls where the punch goes, which is not
00:39:10 The truth. Yeah, not the truth
00:39:14 But I still think it was fun
00:39:17 Okay, my opinion on that is I know a friend who will buy literally every game that the switch pulls out
00:39:23 And I will try it at his house. And if I think it's cool about myself
00:39:27 I'm going to go in with low expectations because I don't like motion controls a lot, but I'm hopeful for the future
00:39:31 I mean, I think I think it
00:39:35 Very Nintendo has done motion controls good a couple of times and if they did it again
00:39:39 But not nearly enough times to justify that they've been doing it for like 11 years. That's true. Yeah. Yeah, that is true
00:39:47 It's time to pack it in
00:39:49 Yes, I
00:39:51 I basically
00:39:53 No, I'm excited for arms. I I already got arms
00:39:57 But they're gay
00:39:59 They aren't springs. They are like they only reach like this far man
00:40:04 I want to punch I want to punch a cute girl who's like way over there
00:40:07 I I think a punchy cute girl is pretty much constantly
00:40:11 You want to punch women? You've got to allow yourself to get close to them. You can't be a migtail
00:40:17 You can't be a migtail and still beat women
00:40:20 God, who's been great at the greatest conflict. Yeah of interest
00:40:27 Next is Splatoon me and Ben Loew Splatoon. I don't think you even know. Well, I'm sure you know what it is
00:40:33 I mean like in different
00:40:38 Yeah, it's fun man. There's all these different weapons that shoot different amounts of paint at the floor
00:40:43 I will say Splatoon would be the best game ever, but the Wii U is the worst Wii game console
00:40:48 It's so bad. Yeah, like like having to play it with the gamepad is the worst experience a human
00:40:53 Yes, Splatoon. It just felt like a game where nothing I did mattered
00:40:57 It was completely random which team ended up getting the most paint
00:41:01 It was the big cluster clock
00:41:03 Okay, it is true that it can feel like you can be feel like you're winning the whole game
00:41:07 And then you lose at the end and you don't know why
00:41:10 Okay, most of my experience with Splatoon comes from the competitive mode. They have yeah, which isn't terth wars
00:41:16 It's like a bunch of objective based game
00:41:18 It's and those game modes are very very fun unique and they do involve like putting like paint on the ground in multiple ways
00:41:25 However, they aren't as
00:41:27 Open like open in the sense that you can just paint anywhere. I don't count this boy's routine
00:41:32 It's much more again objective based and you feel far far more important in that mode
00:41:37 Wait, you're talking about like the single player. No, I'm talking about the the competitive mode
00:41:41 The there there's terth wars, which is casual and then there I
00:41:45 You should call it's called ranked mode ranked mode. I mean they have different game game modes in that
00:41:49 I don't think I ever played any of those. Okay. That's that's good. Um, they're fun. Yeah, uh single player is also very fun
00:41:56 Well, it's a single player single player campaign was kind of fun
00:42:00 It was felt it felt a little hollow the game is definitely meant to be yes
00:42:03 It's not meant for that. Uh, the final boss was very fucking hype. However, the rest is your favorite campaign
00:42:09 I could not fucking care less the final the final I have not actually played the final boss, but I've seen it
00:42:13 It's awesome. It is incredible. Um, he's black. He's on octopus and he's my dad
00:42:19 The um, I I love the inklings
00:42:22 Yes, I love the whatever their octopus enemies are called the octolings the octolings and the inklings
00:42:29 I love that they're like evil beast children. Yes, that hate and eat one another. Yes, I only live
00:42:34 They only live for battle and urban youth fashion
00:42:38 There's two there's two things that drive them in urban youth fashion and murder
00:42:44 Yes, it's true
00:42:46 And that's why I love it. Um
00:42:48 Uh, I like that you can change your hairstyle in this game. I am gay
00:42:52 And as such, I like to dress up my fictional character in many ways. Well, here's the thing
00:42:57 Here's the one thing that did fucking kill me about splatoon, which was that there was no local multiplayer
00:43:02 Well, no, there was local multiplayer
00:43:04 But it was like shitty and bad
00:43:06 Because it wasn't the actual it wasn't like a turf war
00:43:10 It was like who can like shoot the most balloons or something
00:43:13 It was awful
00:43:14 And I think the reason it was implemented that way is because like the real game has all this
00:43:19 Functionality that requires the Wii U game pad and you're only supposed to have one
00:43:22 So if they can fucking cure that well, they they have because the whole point of this which is you're supposed to have two
00:43:28 Yeah, if you want to play with some of these I guess well, I mean, I guess the point is that there's there's so many different ways to play
00:43:33 That's kind of a shit solution because then that's just being like buy another console
00:43:38 I mean, yeah, I could I could play with my friends by buying two. We use already. Okay. Think about this way
00:43:44 If you have a friend who wants to play splatoon, they are going to have a fucking Nintendo switch
00:43:49 I guess
00:43:50 No, what if you want to just bring a friend over really? Hey play this fun game that I have
00:43:54 Uh, you're right. However, I think that's far less likely than the scenario I have presented
00:44:01 Maybe maybe I do agree that it should be
00:44:05 Not that they should they should have some game mode where like just you you and a friend just fucking give each other
00:44:12 Your joy cons and just like have a little fucking mini
00:44:16 I think it will be like that
00:44:18 I that's what that's all I wanted was just give me the regular game in miniature to play with the friend
00:44:23 Locally on one concept. I I do believe it will be that however, uh, I think it's
00:44:30 Whatever
00:44:31 yeah, anyway
00:44:33 They they didn't they didn't really explain how exactly the multiplayer modes would work in the new, uh
00:44:39 Platoon, but I
00:44:41 They'll probably make it better. Um, I'm sure they will and even if they don't I'm gonna be mainly plain ranked
00:44:47 Yeah, and I will have a blast doing so I will be able to dress up my little boy
00:44:53 And he will be my son and hopefully I don't have my dick inside of anymore because the police came to my house that one time
00:44:59 It was it was a fiasco. Hopefully my dick doesn't find his way
00:45:03 And then on that note and then there was some anime shit
00:45:07 Uh
00:45:08 Well before the animation all right all right
00:45:11 Before the anime shit, uh a a a game that we all care about the new mario
00:45:16 Oh
00:45:20 Yes, you know very accurate. You know I was I was skeptical when I first saw because like the first thing they show is him in that like
00:45:27 GTA world with like the regular people walking around and I think it looks awesome
00:45:30 I thought it looked bad at first, but like the more I thought about it
00:45:35 Like every level of like yeah every level of the game looks so different
00:45:38 You said that when watching the trailer and like I don't know it's it's this is I don't feel like it's meant to
00:45:45 Maybe I was thinking a bit more is like the lore of the mushroom kingdom
00:45:48 We're like I don't I don't think that's what they're going for
00:45:51 Well, the as they say in the presentation the whole thing is that mario has left the mushroom kingdom because he's bored and the piece of
00:45:57 Shit is that I'd miss that well the game is called mario odyssey
00:46:02 Which brings to mind some kind of like weird wonderlandy like he's just totally in a whole different dimension
00:46:08 Yeah, he the whole the whole thing is mario is fucking bored and he wants to just walk around other places
00:46:14 Yeah, you know, I think I thought that like the whole game would be set in like a realistic looking city
00:46:18 Which is not definitely not no that would have been very weird
00:46:22 When tom and them were talking about it the other night
00:46:25 They made it out to seem like some kind of hub world like the sonic 06 kind of thing
00:46:30 That it looks like sonic 06. Just if you look at only that part of the trailer it looks like it's just one world of many
00:46:35 Yes, yeah, I think it would probably be like the first world
00:46:39 However, they're like again, there are like a ton of different fucking worlds. Yeah
00:46:44 and and they and I want to
00:46:46 Iterate that none of them look like fucking the gay shit we've been getting for a while now
00:46:51 They don't mean like 3d world and stuff. Yeah, well, yeah, they don't look like grassy plants
00:46:55 They don't look like fucking sky world. They don't look like any of that gay shit. Oh, yeah
00:46:59 There's like there's like pastel polygon world and there's like
00:47:03 Forest world there's there's a forest world that specifically has like like a rainy backdrop and like mario was swimming in it
00:47:09 And there's like rays of light coming through down from the trees
00:47:11 And it's like fairly like like a like a moody green and blue color scheme
00:47:15 There's also that one world that I can't describe in any other white way than red squares
00:47:21 I don't remember that one like it just kind of looks like there's red squares and trees and it's it's it's odd
00:47:27 A whole lot of rebel pixels. Yes
00:47:29 the the communistic
00:47:32 Overlord himself the rest of the rebel pixel. Um, um, um, okay, so I just
00:47:39 You know, I was skeptical at first and I was like, uh realistic world
00:47:42 But the more I think about it the more I'm just like man
00:47:44 I actually am really happy that they're just making a new 3d mario and it's been way too long
00:47:50 I don't know why they let it go on this long
00:47:52 But I'll fucking play it. Uh, I
00:47:55 Okay, I understand you not wanting like not you you but like you some of you
00:48:00 Yeah, uh, not wanting to have mario interact with normally proportion to human beings
00:48:06 However, I think it looks hilarious ridiculous and I love
00:48:10 Yeah, if it's him like
00:48:12 You know, yeah, if he's on like some interdimensional odyssey and it's just one of many wacky worlds that's cool. Yeah
00:48:17 It's good. Uh, and and I like the idea of being able to run around a city
00:48:22 Uh, and just fucking jump around because I want I I want to jump around in the city
00:48:27 It's funny to because like the whole like open world city game is such like a saturated genre
00:48:33 Now so like to have like fucking mario show up to like a world that looks like that
00:48:37 But like do mario style platforming through it? I don't know if that's like the joke
00:48:41 They were trying to make with it or anything, but it's funny to me think about it. I don't think it's a joke
00:48:45 I think it looks cool
00:48:48 And they wanted it. Well, definitely some humor in there and putting mario alongside you. Yes, that is true. Yeah
00:48:55 Yeah, I gear in that and
00:48:57 Not just the aesthetics of it the gameplay itself looks very fucking cool because there's a bunch of movement mechanics
00:49:04 Yeah, like throwing the hat throwing the hat was the big one that everyone noticed
00:49:08 But there are also many other things such as I saw the cake returning from samurai 64
00:49:13 I saw him rolling down a hill that looked like a whole new move
00:49:17 And uh, there's just a bunch of little shit and in at one point he was
00:49:21 Riding a fucking lion a lion and also he uh, what he was picking up something that like like a bladed oddish
00:49:29 Not an odd
00:49:31 Radish radish. I don't know if that will just be that but I hope it's like a mario 2 thing. Um
00:49:38 Not really relevant to anything, but I'll be pretty excited to hear matthew matosis review it when it comes out. That should be fun
00:49:46 Uh, what I really love the mario games
00:49:50 Because like I I like to just move around and it comes from a comfortable environment
00:49:55 Yeah, I like the what's the gay word that you do use kinesthetics
00:50:00 Well, he doesn't make that up. But yeah, well, yeah that he would he is he would use it
00:50:04 Yeah, that's what I because it's the word to describe it
00:50:08 That's gay. Yeah, it's gay
00:50:10 Uh
00:50:11 Yes, I like that and I like the idea of being able to maneuver in various different ways because in in in fucking galaxy
00:50:18 And shit, you just you just move and you jump you have like you have less movement options
00:50:23 Yeah, and that's why I love sunshine so much because the the flood adds so many layers of complexity
00:50:28 Yeah, it's the best working game ever made. Yeah. Hmm. Um
00:50:32 It's uh incredible, uh, and I'm coming and mario looks good, which is something I'd never thought I'd ever say
00:50:41 Yes, well, you know, uh semen is clogging my entire brain cell
00:50:45 Well, yeah, I mean new mario new 3d mario. It's pretty good. I want to play it. Yeah, what what more can you say?
00:50:52 Um, I'll no no moving on moving on. Uh, there was a bunch of fucking anime shit
00:50:57 Uh
00:50:59 Xenoblade whatever
00:51:03 Shin Megami Tensei like dude like anime like what the fuck even is a shin megami tensei
00:51:09 Some kind of some kind of some kind of you know creature every year. There's like 17 new shin megami Tensei games even though
00:51:18 People only care about persona. Yeah, I don't know why they even bother with the rest of this
00:51:24 I don't
00:51:26 You know the only thing that I like like the only thing that I know about
00:51:29 Jumagami Hidze that seems even remotely cool is if you kick someone's ass hard enough
00:51:34 They will ask you like a strange riddle and if you solve their retarded
00:51:38 They will join you. Yeah, it's like persona three and four are both great games
00:51:43 But there's 50 shin megami games and the rest of them are all hot trash. Yeah, no one do care about
00:51:51 Uh, another note
00:51:53 They got the animeist thing. Yeah, that shit brings all the boys to the yard
00:51:58 Uh, uh, that sucks and that everyone loves
00:52:01 80 games and development. That's a lot of shit. We have games. I promise this is indeed not the Wii U
00:52:06 Please trust me. We have video games
00:52:08 Yeah, remember when when when I remember when reggie fill me was like boy
00:52:13 It's the games that are important and boy what games and I was like, you're right reggie. What games?
00:52:18 What name even one?
00:52:22 Reggie looks like
00:52:25 No, I mean like toad creature. He's so rich
00:52:28 Okay, do you just see it looking at him? He's not rich like wealthy. He's rich like chocolate. Yeah. Yeah
00:52:35 Like he's just he's just dark and like if you like take a look at him
00:52:38 You just need a glass of milk to just wash him. You gotta wash him down. Yeah, I need to dilute him with something
00:52:43 He looks like fucking like like lord slug like a big fat Namek
00:52:47 Who found his way to earth and is just shitting up the place. He is literally a goblin. He is definitely a goblin
00:52:55 I think he's a hobgoblin
00:52:57 He's totally a hobgoblin
00:52:59 If you could add some kind of an even a third ob to that hobgoblin word like a slob hobgoblin
00:53:08 Awful he's a church really. He's a fucking gobb sloblin gobb sloblin
00:53:16 He's an everlasting slob gobbster and and then and and then and then you know
00:53:21 Shigeru Miyamoto's there looking like a special needs child playing playing nintendo games
00:53:26 Which he almost certainly is a special needs child looking like a soccer mom who had a stroke in 2005
00:53:33 And never fully recovered
00:53:35 And then and then and then some other guy pokes around pokes around
00:53:39 Yeah, he was totally hiding hiding behind hiding behind a bush as all japanese people are known to do
00:53:47 He jumps out and he's like oh reggie. I'm glad you're right to play a video game
00:53:52 Miyamoto looks like he's aging like benjamin button
00:53:56 But also like a normal person at the same time
00:54:00 He's shrinking and getting smaller and his his cheeks are getting chubbier, but the wrinkles just keep getting deeper and deeper
00:54:07 Oh
00:54:10 Truly unfortunate for all parties
00:54:13 Yes, truly a great source of shame for japan
00:54:17 They gotta hide that boy
00:54:20 They have to hide him away
00:54:21 They have to lock him away where he can't get out before he turns back into a side goat
00:54:28 A disgusting wrinkly sperm floating in a jar before before he regresses to the star child from uh,
00:54:34 Odyssey space odyssey 2001
00:54:36 Oh my god
00:54:38 Floating in a giant like egg
00:54:40 Mm-hmm
00:54:42 A game that is undeniably anime though. I was interested in the fact that it looked fucking weird
00:54:49 project octopus
00:54:51 Wait, was that a game?
00:54:53 Yeah, I thought that was like the subtitle for the new fire emblem or something. No, no
00:54:58 Octopath octopodio
00:55:00 Starship excel saga project octo mom. You play as octo mom. You beat up all of your kids
00:55:07 No
00:55:10 He's gay. Anyway, uh, the game is like it's like final fantasy. It has like pixel pixel graphics
00:55:17 However, it's like it's like 3d, but the prick the the pixels not the pixels the pixels are like
00:55:24 They're still like flat
00:55:26 they're like they're like
00:55:28 Like it's like it's like paper mario
00:55:31 What what do you what?
00:55:33 Uh, wait, I I have to pee really bad. Okay. Let's take a break
00:55:40 Okay, okay. I'm back for peeing. Uh, it was like octopath missionary
00:55:45 Uh, yes, that sounds right. Uh, it was like if you were playing with magnets like picks like pixel art magnets
00:55:52 Like in a paper mario s world
00:55:56 That oh, oh, yeah, it looked like it looked like jrpg. It had like jrpg pixel. I remember that and I didn't know what it was
00:56:03 Weird, I thought it was just like some retro like concept art for the new for the new fire emblem or something
00:56:09 No, it was not even the same game at all
00:56:11 Like they all that that anime segment of the whole game of the presentation was just all jumbled together
00:56:18 Uh, uh another anime that we hate uh skyrim
00:56:22 Uh, everyone was joking about how it was in the the original trailer
00:56:26 But it wasn't actually officially announced for the switch and everyone's gonna think
00:56:30 Everyone said it was just not going to be there. Yeah
00:56:33 Which would have been hilarious. It would have been very high room on there. But but Todd Howard the literal liar himself gets up on stage
00:56:41 In in in the in his aztec temple. He has built into his house
00:56:45 And he says that yes skyrim is coming and uh, fuck. Yeah, bro
00:56:50 But what I want to know is why anyone likes skyrim or or is pretending to like skyrim
00:56:56 Um, search me man. I don't play Bethesda games
00:57:00 Yeah, uh Bethesda is uh, awful and um
00:57:05 Todd Howard can suck my weenie
00:57:08 Uh, yeah, I don't I don't know. I just yeah
00:57:11 I know I said before that I like to get immersed and like have like a narrative
00:57:15 Which you would think I would love games like skyrim, but like I don't know
00:57:19 They're so big and overblown and like and I'm not they look so fucking bad
00:57:25 I I'm I'm not looking I'm not looking to be impressed with the scale of a game. Yeah, you know, I don't care about that. So I don't
00:57:33 Like yeah, like like the idea that a game is like a hundred hours long
00:57:36 And like the map is a million fucking miles wide. It's just kind of exhausting more than like exciting for me. Yeah, uh death
00:57:44 Uh skyrim looks bad and I've only heard bad things about I hear it's boring. I hear it's dull. Well, I have no reason why I want to play
00:57:51 I I only hear criticism of it
00:57:53 But it's criticism that makes me think that it's probably an overall solid game for what it is
00:57:58 But it's just got like does lots of little shit wrong that really pisses fans off. Yeah
00:58:03 Um, uh either way would never fucking buy it. It's a pc game. I could literally just bar it legally
00:58:12 Was that's like censored? Yes. Yeah, okay
00:58:16 I could yeah, I would never buy this game. I could literally just bar it
00:58:21 I see I see yes
00:58:23 Um, uh, then we got to the the crazy no more heroes guy. It was a stumbling mumbling joke
00:58:29 Stumbling mumbling fool that's sudo 51. I can't believe that was sudo 51. Is that true? Yes. Is that really okay? Okay
00:58:35 Um, I have never played a no more heroes game, but due to there's only there's only one isn't there? There's two, okay
00:58:42 Um, it it looks like something I would love and that picture of travis that was like on like the screen was so fucking hot
00:58:49 I'm i'm gay now. I am gay
00:58:51 What did his shirt say it was something like travis touched out of strikes bad
00:58:55 All right, um, but his face was so charismatic. It's so Japanese. I like I like that
00:59:01 No more heroes exist. I think I played a little bit of the first one was like, that's fine
00:59:06 Um, I it looks cool. I like seeing it around. Yeah, I don't feel the need to play it myself necessarily
00:59:14 Want to play
00:59:17 Maybe if I were paid to play that game, I'm definitely I mean I I do respect sudo 51's like weird outsider
00:59:24 Like auteur fucking game making ethos. I think it's great that he's around. Yes
00:59:30 Yeah, it's pretty sweet. Then after after I was turned gay live. Yeah
00:59:35 Uh fucking ea came out to talk about how like they like nintendo and they are going to make fifa
00:59:42 Yeah, wait, I totally
00:59:45 Do not even remember that happening. Yeah, I don't recall. Oh, wait. I do remember
00:59:49 I do remember the migtao soccer players appearing very briefly in the like the final trailer. Yes
00:59:55 Uh, he was the guy who had bill trin and narrating
01:00:01 The giant he was the the giant he was the giant from uh twin peaks. Yes with that guy
01:00:07 He's happening again
01:00:09 it uh
01:00:11 Literally, no, I don't think I've ever heard anyone say anything cause about ea
01:00:23 It's like searching through the library of his mind trying to come up with one thing to repeat that trying to remember what a video game
01:00:31 Is
01:00:32 Yeah, yeah, they're evil probably. No, no, do they make do they make any good games that aren't gay? Well, yeah, no
01:00:38 I'm not saying they're evil. I'm just saying they're just they're just gay. Do they no, but serious question
01:00:42 Do they make any good games? No, okay
01:00:45 They make sports games and they make just general gay games like what give me an example
01:00:50 I think they do like some sort of call duty stuff. Um
01:00:54 Okay, so
01:00:56 Modern gaming they're modern gaming for some part. All right, uh, then I have a bullpoint that says no games
01:01:02 No games
01:01:03 Yeah, there weren't enough games for sure and the games that there were were a lot of anime bullshits
01:01:07 Okay, okay, he there are four games in my opinion coming out for the nintendo switch
01:01:13 Uh, so far I announce. Yeah, uh, two of them
01:01:16 switch one or one two switch looks um
01:01:20 Like a look like I'm not on my raid system that ranges from a negative three to a positive three
01:01:26 It is a positive one. Yeah, and then arms looks like a positive two. Well, you know what?
01:01:32 Okay, I hope we were saying this as you're watching it
01:01:36 It would be really cool if arms had like a competitive scene. Yes
01:01:39 Like like and and corollary to that like for that to happen
01:01:43 It would need to have like there would need to be real depth to the gameplay
01:01:46 Like probably there would need to be lots of like builds you could make like customize your characters to behave in different ways and then like
01:01:53 You know strategize beyond beyond just the moment to moment dodging punches. Yeah, and just have general
01:01:59 complexity in in the in the combat itself. I mean they they
01:02:03 And they introduced the game with by saying like it's a game with lots of depth and complexity and replayability
01:02:09 Which I hope is true. Uh, if that were if that were true, it looks fucking fun
01:02:13 But like the game we actually saw in the trailer there wasn't much there. We didn't see it do very much
01:02:18 I heard from a little birdie. I didn't actually watch the nintendo tree house presentation
01:02:22 Which is where they show the old games and death
01:02:25 I heard a little birdie telling me that in the tree house presentation where the plane arms
01:02:30 One of the person one of the commentators is talking about
01:02:33 Frame inputs and how to save frames and maximize your your min maxing your your inputs like a like a real fighting game
01:02:41 That's pretty cool. It is fucking pretty cool
01:02:45 And it makes me think that they actually like care about this game. It's not going to be a shitty it
01:02:51 I like it. I hope I hope that's true. I hope that's true
01:02:54 Even though that kind of excludes me because i'm not going to get so fucking good at arms
01:02:59 And i'm going to be worrying about saving the frames, but I still like it
01:03:02 Yeah, uh, I now that jess is out of the room and i'm not scared to death. I
01:03:07 To a three
01:03:09 Thank god
01:03:10 Uh and and and fucking splatoon and mario they look incredible. They look like they will be the best game ever made
01:03:16 Um, if if splatoon is if splatoon is any better than original splatoon, it will be the best game ever made
01:03:22 And I won't accept any future games as valin. I just can't wait for new spot this
01:03:29 I never actually did any splat because I didn't I didn't have a Wii U
01:03:31 I just played it at my like friend's house when I was visiting in the future
01:03:35 If you get a switch, we will become the splatoon boys
01:03:38 Oh god, can I oh god? I would love that so much. But can I can I is there a place for
01:03:45 I want to make one
01:03:47 I want to make I want to make room for no I want to make room for it in my heart is what i'm saying
01:03:51 Yeah, and in my bed pokemon is out the door besides
01:03:55 Well, well that that's completely inaccurate because there's a pokemon game coming out for the switch. Oh, no
01:04:01 Wait, why didn't they show that?
01:04:04 Uh, because it it's like all
01:04:07 Even though like everyone who cares knows
01:04:09 Well, like apparently I don't care because I didn't know until you told me, uh, it you know how like there's platinum for diamond pearl
01:04:15 Yeah, yeah, the sun the moon is going to have a platinum on the switch. What's it called? Is it called eclipse?
01:04:20 It's called the codename of stars. I hope it's called eclipse. Okay, the codename of stars
01:04:24 Fair enough
01:04:27 Not not happy about it. You're gonna be able to walk with your pokemon. I think pokemon is
01:04:31 I hope that's true because the walking pokemon and harkol's soul silver is actually the best thing that ever happened
01:04:37 There's even more reason for it now
01:04:39 Because before you couldn't really do that much with the pokemon. Like it was it was fucking sick
01:04:44 Yeah, but there's not a lot you can do now think about fucking this
01:04:47 You're walking with your pokemon you turn around you press a you immediately go into the pokemon uh of me pokemon refresh
01:04:54 Oh
01:04:55 Cool. Yeah, turn around talk to them and you pet them and give them the pain. Yeah. Yeah
01:04:59 Just a little thing just the little things nintendo. Just give us these little things and then you promote them to uh
01:05:04 Potlitenit and then they and then they die. Yeah, that's right
01:05:07 Because I didn't fucking switch out to water. You fucking return because I'm an idiot. Yeah, that's correct. Um
01:05:14 Uh, there's also a curbie game coming. I'm fairly certain
01:05:19 I would hope so. Yeah, I would really hope so god
01:05:23 Every time a new curbie game comes out. I say the same fucking thing
01:05:26 But let me say it again. Please bring back powers and power combining from yes from curbie 64
01:05:32 Yes, please that would be fucking sick. That would make the switch the best console. Yeah, uh power combines before is
01:05:40 It's so good
01:05:41 And there's no reason they couldn't continue to do it forever
01:05:45 I I know why because curbie game there there are two eras of curbie games
01:05:49 There's the adventure era and these then there's the superstar era
01:05:54 Adventure era
01:05:55 Operate the abilities in that operate. There are a lot more abilities
01:06:01 However, that all the abilities have like one use they all have one move that you can execute
01:06:06 And a superstar there. Well, I shouldn't say that way more, but there's the same amount of abilities
01:06:11 But each ability
01:06:12 Uh is it has an entire move set dedicated to it. Yeah, which was amazing. Yeah, and the best and uh
01:06:19 Two more operates on an adventure
01:06:21 Uh style ability. So each thing only does one thing. Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
01:06:27 You know what? Yeah, I think I would if I had to have one or the other
01:06:30 Maybe I would like the the complex abilities that have like whole move sets
01:06:34 But why can't it be both? Yeah? Yeah
01:06:38 All the things that nintendo doesn't do yeah when they're fucking nintendo and they could do anything
01:06:43 Yeah, they could do literally
01:06:45 I
01:06:47 Hope I hope they do do that that would be crime at least even if it's not that at least
01:06:53 Not I don't have anything against like epic yarn and stuff like it is what it is and that's fine
01:06:59 But why have there not been new Kirby games that have the power system and like new powers and stuff
01:07:04 Like why don't why have they not made more Kirby games that are about the powers?
01:07:07 I
01:07:09 Agree, yeah, I mean like I love that. I mean the problem is is the Kirby games don't come out that often
01:07:15 And that's the problem right there. Yeah, and and
01:07:19 Like whenever there's a new like mainland Kirby like like they're two Kirby games
01:07:23 They're there are the side games that are experimental weird and have nothing to do with anything
01:07:27 Kirby related and they're awesome. Yeah, they're always like air ride
01:07:31 Yeah, like air ride like canvas curse shit like math attack. Yeah
01:07:35 I shouldn't do that shit cool shit like math attack. Yeah, I haven't actually played any of those games, but
01:07:42 Yeah, I hear air ride is really good. I heard math attack
01:07:45 It looks really the math math attack is good
01:07:49 Like like the gameplay itself is good, but there's like there's like really like a ton of mini games
01:07:56 And like a lot of the Kirby anime characters come up really. Yeah, it's it's odd. It's very odd
01:08:02 It's good. No, I like it. I do like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right
01:08:06 And there's the mainland Kirby games. What? Oh, sorry. Just do you do we know what the Kirby game for the switch?
01:08:11 No, right? Well, I don't think it's even confirmed. I just know that howl is working
01:08:17 Okay, and howl doesn't fucking do this. Don't they do Pokemon?
01:08:24 It's your scheme. That's right. Well, why did I think there was a no, all right? I'm stupid
01:08:30 Anyway, mainly Kirby games are like shit like super star like a vision
01:08:34 And those ones always introduce at least one new
01:08:38 And shit like robo bot introduced like the mech system
01:08:42 The mech system in Kirby. Yeah, the fuck is Kirby robo bot?
01:08:47 Planet robo bot Kirby has a mech. It literally looks exactly like like like
01:08:52 Gurren
01:08:53 What? Oh, no, no, look on. Sorry. It looks exactly like we're gone the big one or the head
01:08:59 Okay, um, what game are we talking about?
01:09:03 Kirby planet robo bot. That's what?
01:09:05 What? It came out like two like a year ago. I've never heard of it
01:09:12 I've not heard of Kirby planet robo. I swear to God. This is the first time and you're making it up. No, no
01:09:21 It looks awesome. Yeah, I mean it is awesome. It is awesome. Anyway
01:09:27 What the fuck are we talking about you? I don't know Kirby and just we went on a Kirby
01:09:33 The point is Kirby's awesome. Please come to the switch. I love you. Yeah, I can get behind that
01:09:40 What games do you want to see like we're over the presentation fucking it was good
01:09:45 Yeah, wait, is there with or any like? Oh, well, um Zelda, which I don't really oh my god
01:09:49 I forgot about Zelda. I have notes for that. I don't really play Zelda
01:09:53 But if I had a switch would I
01:09:56 Honestly, no because it's kind of like Skyrim. Yes
01:09:59 It kind of has the same reasons I wouldn't play it as I wouldn't play a game like Skyrim
01:10:02 Even I don't the cutscenes looked really cool like the art style looks great
01:10:06 Um, I don't know. Yeah, it looks it looks neat. Uh, my note says hark zelda. It has locations
01:10:12 It has uh goblins and uh, yes, and there was a man with a shark for a head. Yes
01:10:18 Uh as someone who hates zelda that trailer looks fucking sick and I kind of want to play. Yeah
01:10:25 It did look pretty cool. Yeah, I don't I don't know if I would actually do it unless I'm less like multiple people
01:10:31 Independently told me like then you have to play the new zelda. It would surprise you in ways you cannot imagine
01:10:37 And then I'd be like, well
01:10:40 Fuck you. Fuck maybe maybe I guess we can't move my cold bitter heart
01:10:45 No, only only under
01:10:49 Oh man, kid. Did you did you see all the sweet undertails? They're releasing on another nintendo switch
01:10:54 There's zelda undertale curbie undertale mario undertale pokémon undertale pokemon undertale platoon undertale
01:11:02 And finally earthbound
01:11:05 Not never the best under tail never never in the world
01:11:09 Never what what if they release a new earthbound game?
01:11:13 Um, it will be shit because he toy has specifically stated
01:11:16 He does not want to do another earthbound and in fact they would give another guy and that new guy would be awful
01:11:22 Yeah, okay. I didn't think about that. That's too bad. All right, never mind then our earthbound doesn't need to be made again
01:11:28 They just need to release mother three
01:11:30 Wait, they already released mother three
01:11:33 No, is it only like fan translated? Yeah, what? Yeah, what they still haven't released mother three. No
01:11:39 Not even like the virtual console. No, what the fuck? Yeah, why?
01:11:44 Why just like like a year and a half ago they released the first mother
01:11:49 And not mother three. Yeah, and the thing about mother one is that it had been fully translated
01:11:55 Officially by nintendo
01:11:57 Since it since it was made like in 1998 or 1989 or something. So like it had already been released
01:12:03 Yeah previously and they re-released it. Yeah, they didn't release mother three
01:12:07 Well, like it like basically the idea like it was fully translated and then they just would put it up on a shelf somewhere
01:12:14 And they're like, oh, we'll release that someday
01:12:17 Oh, and they just finally got around to it. Yeah. Yeah
01:12:19 ridiculous
01:12:22 How fucking long does it take to translate a game from japanese?
01:12:25 Well, I don't think very long since the fan translation did it in like a year. Yeah. Yeah, this is nintendo
01:12:32 But this is nintendo we're talking about that can't be fucking bothered to model walk cycles for i don't know
01:12:37 20 pokemon. Yeah 30 pokemon. Yeah, you know
01:12:45 Ridiculous, uh off criminal literally criminal. Yeah, I the police are en route to japan
01:12:54 I've called interpol
01:12:56 They're going to arrest arrest uh miyamoto and the and the ghost of satori wewata. They're gonna send ghost busters over there
01:13:02 And sakura con
01:13:04 So send them to sakura con to stop all the video games
01:13:09 The source of all evil sakura con
01:13:12 I mean, there's got to be some mastermind behind it
01:13:14 Uh, you know how like in fiction like industry is often portrayed as like this big like uh
01:13:20 Cloud of black smoke with like giant pipes like lean out the smoke and like there's a bunch of work is being whipped
01:13:25 That's what I meant to sakura con is
01:13:30 It's not even it's just
01:13:34 It's not even related in a fiction anyway
01:13:38 But still but still
01:13:41 I think all these shit games somebody's making them
01:13:46 It has to be that
01:13:48 Who else could be so evil
01:13:51 As as as john sakura con the ceo sakura con
01:13:56 As he famously said I will I will poison video games
01:14:02 No, none of that. I will continue to make video games. I will continue to make video games. He said twirling
01:14:12 And gnashing his teeth his filed down
01:14:16 It is most who is the most heinous prediction video games will get more realistic
01:14:21 And real life will become more like
01:14:24 Until you can't fucking tell what's happening
01:14:27 um
01:14:31 Then until the switch coming out in two months
01:14:35 Do you have any other games that you'd like to see on the switch? Uh, yes. Let me think I
01:14:40 I I'm very interested in a new shadow pokemon game. Did you play it? Oh my gala of darkness?
01:14:46 I have not played any of those. Okay. First of all
01:14:49 They're great games in and of themselves, but you specifically would fucking adore those games. You think so?
01:14:56 First of all, they're super fucking edgy. They seem like edgy
01:15:00 Versions. Yeah. Okay. Do they do they have like pokemon battles and like actual normal? Yeah. Yes
01:15:07 Then why don't then why aren't then why don't?
01:15:10 Okay, what separates a shadow game from a mainline game? Okay, uh, it's much more like an rpg
01:15:16 This is that there aren't like gyms like it's it's a it's a much more involving story
01:15:22 Like like you use pokemon and like there is a story about pokemon
01:15:28 There is there is I have never even considered playing one. Yeah, but
01:15:33 Okay, maybe I was wrong. Okay, uh like like uh in pokemon. There is no story
01:15:39 And if there is a story, it's bad besides seven minutes and then there's a good story. Yeah, uh,
01:15:44 But xD gala of darkness has like an interesting plot
01:15:48 Like and it it basically has a narrative which is something that pokemon games lack completely
01:15:54 But is it is it missing any of the things that make a mainline pokemon game? Um,
01:16:01 It is missing extraneous details such as like gyms
01:16:05 fine
01:16:06 Yes, uh
01:16:08 Like there is no like root system
01:16:11 Like like the the way battle's working that is
01:16:15 Well, like like if the story needs you to go to a town your character will get on a spike and he will go to that town
01:16:19 And then you will like like the towns are fucking huge and there's a ton of shit to do in each town
01:16:25 Uh, and you can battle people in that town and you have to take down like in the evil corporation
01:16:29 Do you catch pokemon?
01:16:30 Uh, you can catch pokemon like you can catch normal wild pokemon. Yeah, however
01:16:37 Uh, it it's not like you don't walk in it. It's
01:16:40 fairly convoluted at least compared to walking into all grass
01:16:44 You you have to there there are specific. I think they're called poke. I think they're actually called poke spots
01:16:49 Poke stops poke spots. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay
01:16:53 And you have to get like I think it's like cheese or something and lay them out for the pokemon
01:16:57 Really and then like come back 20 minutes later, and they'll be like a wild like aggro on there
01:17:02 What? Yes
01:17:04 Okay, but that's not how you get pokemon the game the point of the game. How do you get pokemon?
01:17:08 Oh, you don't even know that. I don't know anything. It's it's okay. Okay. It's fucking sick. You're gonna love this
01:17:14 Okay, all right at the beginning at the beginning of xc gale of darkness. I know like this like that's on the game
01:17:19 Yeah, yeah, and so it's called him. Colosseum is the first game in series. Wait, colosseum is a shadow game
01:17:24 Yeah, does it have like a plot? Yeah, it like what? Yes. I thought it was just like a battler. No
01:17:30 Oh
01:17:33 Uh, but pretty much colosseum is like a like like a like colosseum
01:17:37 Like xc gale of darkness is an erect sequel like it has the same town, but it's like the same plot weird. Yeah
01:17:43 Does it have its own region?
01:17:45 No, well regions isn't it? It's oh, I mean, I don't know. I mean like like both of the games have their own
01:17:52 Like yeah, yeah, but but the both take the same thing. I get it. What what land are they in the or region?
01:17:58 Or are re yeah, okay
01:18:00 Uh, it's fucking cool
01:18:03 You catch hope like them your main method of catching pokemon is at the beginning of xc gale of darkness
01:18:08 You're given a snag machine
01:18:10 And you this is like like an arm like grip like like fucking like like dog
01:18:14 Like like dr. Claw like arm. Okay
01:18:18 And they're at the game. They're like like this this team called human. It's like team cypher. I'm pretty sure
01:18:24 Uh, just has made a bunch of shadow pokemon because shadow pokemon are just like the evil versions of ragan
01:18:30 Well, not even evil. They're more like like they like they injected depression and fucking crazy shit into pokemon
01:18:38 And now pokemon are just fucking
01:18:40 Flailing around and they're just they just can't even function like monsters. Yeah, they're monsters and they're in pain
01:18:46 Constantly, yeah, holy shit
01:18:48 And like like whenever like like I can't even like describe how cool is when you see a shadow pokemon
01:18:54 Because like someone throws out a pokemon
01:18:56 And then you get to see like the little animation play and he's like wait, oh man
01:19:00 I really want to have that book like that one looks pretty cool
01:19:03 And then like like like like I came like I'm gonna do like a visual joke for this like you're okay
01:19:10 Like like he throws out the pokemon like someone throws out pokemon and then your kid reaches this
01:19:14 Like a shock. Yeah. Yeah. He's like what?
01:19:18 And then like like his glasses like like lights up
01:19:21 He's like robot glasses and they light up and like fucking like like like shadow fire bursts out of the pokemon
01:19:26 Like it like it's fucking exploding my eyes are wide with with passion and terror and and and it says a
01:19:33 Shia like like that pokemon is a shadow pokemon in all caps
01:19:37 And and you know what you fucking do? What do you do? This is a trainer battle
01:19:42 Yeah, you whittle that pokemon down and you snag that trainers pokemon with your like mecca arms
01:19:48 And and and for every pokeball and like it has ultra balls and stuff
01:19:51 But the thing that makes this different is that whenever you throw it like and you know when the pokemon
01:19:55 Little when the pokeball opens. Yeah, a hand comes out and it grabs the pokemon
01:20:00 And it drags it fucking in and you know what you do with that shadow pokemon
01:20:04 Shadow pokemon like like are fucking like shit the shadow pokemon like our shit
01:20:08 They have their own like type and shit. Okay, and they only use like shadow moves
01:20:13 Yeah, and you you have you have to you have to get it to a high friendship
01:20:18 And then you go to like this like this like like
01:20:21 mossy cobble area in the second town
01:20:24 And it's like you have to do like a fucking like like up up here like jesus like baptism with your pokemon
01:20:29 Did like purify them? Yeah. Yeah, you purify you like like it's something like
01:20:33 Like your bedouf opens his heart to you
01:20:37 Yes, exactly. I know my shadow bedouf. Yes, exactly. That's exactly what it's fucking like
01:20:43 Oh, wow, and and you are now best friends with your bedouf
01:20:48 And by the way for I know I know bedouf is june 4. I just I just came to mind first
01:20:52 I don't know why I I just I assume that the shadow that like the shadow pokemon games were like
01:20:58 Like the pokemon card game video game. No
01:21:01 No, not at all. Huh, they are just normal pokemon badminton
01:21:06 And like you catch with balls and stuff. Yeah
01:21:09 Can you nuzlocke one? Yes, you can oh my god
01:21:12 I mean you would have to like change the nunchuck rules because like
01:21:16 It seems like catching is limited or like yes different or yes, like happens at set story points or something. Yeah, well
01:21:24 Yes, uh, so you would either have to make it so like you just keep the same nunchuck rules
01:21:29 Like you can you can only just catch the first book money see in each town. Yeah
01:21:34 Uh, or you can keep it so you can only catch wild like like legitimate wild pokemon
01:21:40 Or it's just you catch whatever you want or like is random each time you have to look it up
01:21:45 But it is feasibly to be my nuzlocke and the nuzlocke's of that game are very intense due to like like
01:21:51 Like he's shadow pokemon are hard to catch first of all and also the game is just like
01:21:57 Like shadow pokemon you have to really fucking grind it out with them and make sure they love you
01:22:02 Like you you form like a way deep bomb
01:22:05 Because because you you have to make sure every pokemon loves you or you can't open up their heart
01:22:11 So but you can use them as their shadow. Yes. Yes
01:22:15 Wow. Yeah. Well, um
01:22:18 All right
01:22:19 I didn't know any of this and now I hope that one does come out in the switch and maybe I'll play
01:22:24 Uh a character who is literally you is named mirror b
01:22:29 and he is
01:22:31 A very tall man very skinny who has a disco outfit and a giant afro that looks like a pokeball
01:22:37 And I've seen him. He has a team of six pokemon. All of them are ludicola
01:22:43 And and and all they want to do is dance
01:22:48 Why don't people talk about these games more because people are
01:22:52 Literally stupid
01:22:53 But do you know how many times I've heard like there's never been a real pokemon game on a console on a home home home console before
01:23:01 I'm gay people people just are just like don't view them as legit because they're like not handheld or whatever
01:23:08 Yeah, they're not handheld and dude. There's no like gyms dude. Like seriously. There's no gyms in alola. What what yeah? Yeah
01:23:15 Yeah, what now I I swear they are literally just like pokemon games. There's pokemon marty
01:23:20 You have to stop an evil organization. Like it's just a fucking pokemon game. Okay. I'm interested
01:23:24 But in 3d and awesome and sold man. I'm sold now the characters design in that game the character designs are also fucking
01:23:32 crazy
01:23:33 And it has so much pathos. It is the most autistic game. You know, I love pathos. That's my favorite thing in art
01:23:41 The the midget you fight at the end is is the best person
01:23:45 Um and you have to play
01:23:48 I think I should probably play gale of darkness. It's uh
01:23:52 I I mean, okay. Both of them are great
01:23:54 Colosseum is very fun
01:23:57 And like you'll you'll get all the backstory of because it like it is actually pretty integral to xc gale of darkness
01:24:04 Like story wise. Yeah, but gale of darkness is a sequel. Yes. Yeah
01:24:09 But but I would say xc gale of darkness is the much funner game and much much
01:24:13 So shadow march lights. No, you can't catch unfortunately. You have no idea how much I cry when I found out you couldn't catch much likes
01:24:21 I thought you said he was in that game
01:24:23 He's just looking at pc
01:24:25 Uh, what what happens is, uh, like sometimes when you put down cheese and the focus box
01:24:30 Catch them with cheese. Yeah, and and and when like sometimes they'll come back and much likes will be there
01:24:35 And he'll have eaten like like normally you have like like like like a full like block of cheese slash 20 per hours
01:24:42 Yeah, yeah, but they'll just have just eaten. Yeah. Yeah. Is he like tubs in neko at suma? Yeah. Yeah, basically
01:24:47 Yeah
01:24:47 And and then his his his trainer this like like really sweet old woman will come be like you mother fucker
01:24:55 You bitch what to the to the munchlax. Yeah, like come back here. I'm sorry for this. I'll give you a revival of her or whatever
01:25:02 Um, I'm a max revive just for you does for me Ben
01:25:07 um
01:25:09 Great game for the nintendo switch neko at suma
01:25:11 Yeah, definitely come out on the nintendo switch. I mean they are doing like iphone shit now. So
01:25:17 Yeah, why not? Um
01:25:20 The way they should make a pokemon runner game
01:25:22 You know what why not actually? Yeah. Yeah, you play different pokemon. You have different moves
01:25:27 Pokemon is able to be like the most diverse cast
01:25:30 The most diverse like asset of games ever any fucking game at all. Yeah with a different pokemon as the protagonist
01:25:38 Yeah, yep. Yeah. Yeah pokemon flights him ride your charizard around that would legitimately be awesome
01:25:44 Yeah, why not? Yeah, just fucking get your fucking mega latios and power up its fucking hyper plane engines and just
01:25:52 Uh, a pokemon mystery dungeon games would come out on this bush. It'd be fucking cool
01:25:56 I don't know another side pokemon franchise that i've kind of been meaning to get into
01:26:01 Okay, see the thing is
01:26:03 Everything I have consoles though, right? They're on handheld. Yeah, everything that I hear like like, okay
01:26:08 I was which is a handheld. So whatever. It's all it's all out the window
01:26:11 Uh, I I played all of the all of the games up to sky and then after after sky
01:26:18 Uh, I I haven't played any of the games and everything I've heard about them
01:26:21 Make it seem like they are the worst video games ever produced by men. Why what's what's what changes after sky?
01:26:27 The pokemon mystery dungeons. Yeah. Yeah, they they become so fucking like like sterile and with no personality
01:26:34 And there's almost no like actual like like autism
01:26:39 I god, no
01:26:41 The the I I I'm serious pokemon was born out of autism. Yeah, literally born out of autism
01:26:46 I feel like like the main selling point of explorers of sky
01:26:50 Is just how autistic can be with it and I love it so dearly
01:26:54 I I mean it is literally a self insert fan fiction. Yeah done extremely well
01:27:01 Uh, the like you like no matter even if you are ebony's or fucking screws age
01:27:07 Asian ebony's or screws. Yeah
01:27:10 You will form such a long lasting bond with both your partner pokemon and the people in your explorers guild
01:27:16 You likely has a point in this game where we're like where our tensions become
01:27:21 Uh high intolerably intolerably high just like race mix in the united states america. Mm-hmm
01:27:28 Which is also another huge problem. Yeah, um, uh that you will be heartbroken
01:27:34 Um, this this is how every day ends in that game. Once you get acquainted with the guild. Did you say dates?
01:27:40 No, I I well there are dates. Oh every day like it's count. Okay. Okay. Okay, uh
01:27:47 Uh, you will come home from like like like a like a fucking uh, uh
01:27:52 A a taxing day out on the job exploring and helping people. Yeah, you will come home and this exact same cutscene will play every time
01:27:59 Well, well, sometimes there'll be exceptions for the story. Yeah, but it will be like louder
01:28:03 It'll come out and he'll be like hey, he's back our best friends back
01:28:07 All right, let's have dinner together and then there's like a dinner cutscene where you're all you get the same
01:28:11 All your friends. Yeah. Yeah, all your friends are with you. Yeah
01:28:16 And and it's like much much much choo choo choo choo. Wow. I'm so glad I get to be friends with you. Today was a great day. Oh my god
01:28:25 And then you're you and your partner pokemon are sleeping like like like like like like head to toe and you're like
01:28:31 And the partner's like ever since I met you my life hasn't been the same
01:28:35 I'm so glad I met you on the beach that day
01:28:37 I I now have a purpose in my life and I love and I love you dearly chimcharr
01:28:43 Oh my god
01:28:45 And then he'll be like good night. I love you and he'll like kiss it
01:28:48 He'll kiss his treasure and and he'll go to sleep. I don't know how much of this you're making though
01:28:53 I'm not making a fucking any of it. That's why it's the best game ever made
01:28:59 Thanks for listening to the pokemon mystery dungeon podcast for the rowdy fuckers cop killies folks
01:29:05 I really no I really want to play them. Yeah, uh
01:29:09 Red and blue are like red and blue mystery dungeon. Yeah, are also very good. Uh
01:29:14 I I thought that was that was sky. You were just talking. Yeah, it's uh sky is by far the best one, but uh, it okay
01:29:22 Play blue and play sky. Those are those are the best ones of each one
01:29:25 The reason my blue is better than red is because for some weird reason
01:29:30 Red came out on the gameplay advanced and blue was on the ds. Yeah, I don't know why
01:29:36 Coverage coverage. Yeah coverage. Um
01:29:40 Blue just feels better to play and uh blue is like
01:29:45 Like it has just like like it has the same amount of pay posts I feel
01:29:49 But I feel like I wasn't as connected to the characters in that game. Which one did you play first?
01:29:53 I I played sky first
01:29:55 So you think do you think I should play sky first or blue first? Um
01:29:59 Probably blue. I mean
01:30:02 I honestly like like no knowing your busy schedule. You should probably pick one right this guy. Yeah. Yeah, maybe yeah
01:30:09 But but if you have all the time in the world label because like they are different plots
01:30:13 Yeah, uh, and they're they're both worth it. Uh, did you know, you know primal ground on primal chiroger in gen 6 and alpha ruby and alpha saffa
01:30:21 Yeah, I'm familiar with them
01:30:24 We hang out. Yeah, we have we have coffee twice a month. Uh
01:30:27 Uh primal dialga was in explorers of sky. He's he's the main bad guy
01:30:33 That's not even that's not a thing in like the regular games. No. No, it's not. No primal dialga and he's fucking sick
01:30:39 He's a delicate different gen primal like can't wait. Is there is there primal polkia? No
01:30:46 Wait, why wouldn't it be primal ray quasi? Wait, there's already a mega ray quasi. This is confusing
01:30:51 Why wouldn't sky be ray quasi be the main guy?
01:30:54 Well, first of all because it came out in gen 4 and they wanted to push, you know, the new guys
01:31:00 Uh
01:31:02 Well, and it was just carried over from the past
01:31:05 Okay, uh
01:31:07 And sky is like a different story from
01:31:10 Time and space, right? Uh, like it's it's time and darkness
01:31:13 And it's basically the same thing but like like there's different instances in time and space and they're just they're they're both
01:31:19 In they're they're both similar. Yeah, the sky is different. Yeah sky sky is
01:31:24 It's it's different subtle ways. It's pretty much just the ultimate experience
01:31:28 Okay, is it like the heart gold soul silver version? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, uh, they gave it they gave it the remake treatment
01:31:35 that game
01:31:37 Like like literally
01:31:39 There's there's so many subplots with different pokemon in sky. It's pretty much unfucking believable
01:31:44 There's a whole backstory about how you became a pokemon. Yeah, and it evolves
01:31:48 Uh, a a guard of not a guard of war a uh a grow vile and this a motherfucking
01:31:54 George Costanza like like I I hate him so fucking much
01:31:58 The the scum of the earth dust nor that you will come to believe is literally satan
01:32:06 Good, you know, when I'm on when I'm on bulbapedia, right and I'm looking at pokemon entries
01:32:11 Like I'll be scrolling down and looking at all the various
01:32:14 Data and shit and I'll see like I'll see some bits and pieces like from mystery dungeon
01:32:19 and there will be like
01:32:20 And sometimes like I'll scroll past the little thing and be like, oh, yeah, um, um, um
01:32:28 Simon Simon the yeah, I'm on the page for for bulbasaur like. Oh, yeah, simon the bulbasaur
01:32:34 Yeah, he always dreamed of becoming a gourmet chef. Yeah
01:32:37 And I'm like what
01:32:40 It's fucking awesome that the game is a much better like rpg than any other pokemon game
01:32:44 Yeah, because like does house people have personality and they change their opinion
01:32:47 Yeah, basically like like the entire hub world is just like the town and your ventures guild and they change so much
01:32:55 Like like like each level is a randomly generated thing where like you you just have to help like people
01:33:01 I mean there is like story relevance to the townspeople. Yeah, but the main like meat and bones of the pathos come from the townspeople
01:33:08 Oh, not the pokemon. Oh, wait the townspeople are
01:33:13 Uh, like like like the best thing about it is not everyone has the same opinion to every situation
01:33:20 Which is like basically like like that is how characters are written
01:33:23 But everyone's stupid and no one knows how to write characters and most of the time in shows
01:33:28 characters just agree to do things
01:33:30 Like like like there's a very little conflict
01:33:32 But in book of mystery dungeon, they're like they're like real
01:33:35 They're real people they're more real than most of the people I know
01:33:38 Even though they're fictional pokemon
01:33:42 It sounds great, dude. There's there's there's so there's so much
01:33:46 I think like I've been I've been thinking it over for a long time. I think I have no choice
01:33:49 Yeah to check out the mystery dungeon series
01:33:51 Maybe I'll maybe I'll like play blue and just kind of like blast through it
01:33:56 Just kind of like to get my foot wet feet feet wet and put in the door blue is pretty fucking cool
01:34:01 I won't lie. It is cool
01:34:03 There's a one point where you're you're like running away from home and you have to you have to like like like like
01:34:08 Like you you you have to like face mole trace for whatever reason I forget
01:34:12 Yeah, and your partner turns you and says well, it's been good. We're gonna fucking die, bro
01:34:17 Like it's over like we've been away from home for so long. We don't have any food
01:34:22 We're gonna die to fucking mole trace. Yeah, the thing that's really missing in pokemon is like the real
01:34:28 The real sense of scale of the pokemon because like
01:34:33 Yeah, like they have different stats and like the characters talk about some and some are more story relevant
01:34:38 But really each every pokemon is very comparable to one another in like how big and and important they feel
01:34:45 Like in battle each one is just like one chess piece on your fucking chess board
01:34:50 whereas like
01:34:51 Yeah in in in the in like a real pokemon situation such as the ones that I experience every night in my dream
01:34:58 um
01:35:00 If a fucking moltres showed up like you're fucking I imagine like your entire town would just be raised to the ground
01:35:06 Um, you know if he was it was a bad day for him
01:35:09 I remember there's like one screenshot like like that
01:35:12 I always like point to like like to show how edgy those games are and it's of like like an adorable Pikachu and a squirrel
01:35:19 and like there's like little sprites on the on the on the overworld and there's like a giant mole trace
01:35:24 And there's just dialogue box and there's just squirtle looking at you and he's just saying we are going to die
01:35:31 Beautiful
01:35:32 Like like we are like there's no fucking hope just just goodbye. I'm sorry. I'm so I'm sold man
01:35:40 I'm sold play play both of those like like every pokemon game is the best game I've ever made
01:35:43 Agreed. Yes. Wait. Is there any pokemon that isn't the best game I've ever made? Um, there was like that one like weird like
01:35:49 fire and bloom pokemon game
01:35:51 pokemon conquest
01:35:53 Oh, well, that well, that's okay first. That's not just pokemon. It's like a crossover. Yeah, I saw that
01:35:58 I thought it looked really cool
01:36:00 Although I didn't care about like whatever it was crossing over
01:36:03 But I thought that like a fire a fire emblem style game with wait, that's kind of what mystery dungeon is isn't it?
01:36:09 A little okay. It's not all right. Well, I thought it was a cool idea
01:36:13 to for use with pokemon
01:36:15 I thought it's weird that it's like mixing with all these japanese
01:36:18 Yeah, I don't know anything about it. It does look pretty cool, but I don't I I don't even know anything about it's game
01:36:24 And anyway, they fucking ripped off nuzlocke conquest. Yeah, my famous youtube series on the youtube internet
01:36:30 Uh, truly unfortunate. Yeah, truly truly unfortunate
01:36:33 Um, there's like when will I get my due?
01:36:37 for that
01:36:38 For my contributions, uh, I'm trying to think there's pokemon puzzle league. I don't think that was very good
01:36:43 I have no idea what that is like that one like anime spinoff game for the fucking uh
01:36:48 in the 64 is it like
01:36:50 It's just tetris. I was gonna say is it like uh, dr. Robotnik's mean bean machine. Yeah, whatever
01:36:55 It barely counts. Uh snap was the best game ever made. Yeah snaps cool snaps neat
01:37:00 They should make another snap on the fucking switch
01:37:03 Uh, yeah, the the creator of snap said this is the worst inferior thing I've ever seen
01:37:07 Well, like they're like phones. They're like cameras in your phones now, so it's not like special big pictures of pokemon
01:37:12 Oh
01:37:15 There aren't pokemon in real life you fucking hack. What an idiot. What is it? Oh my god
01:37:21 Wait, there's there's there's cameras in your phone. So
01:37:27 I can't even remember
01:37:29 So it's not special to take pictures of pokemon because everyone's doing I mean, I guess they're playing pokemon go
01:37:34 To the polls and I'm taking pictures of their pokemon. Sure. It sucks
01:37:39 It's not it's like
01:37:41 The no, I never really played I never really played snap except for like a little bit one time
01:37:47 Snap is very fun. It's neat. I like it. Snap is the funnest if you don't know how to play
01:37:52 Yeah, maybe you don't know how to like optimize. Yeah. Yeah a lot so many games
01:37:57 Yeah, because then often then we'll do something quick in the first level
01:38:00 I remember the first time I saw lapras like out in the ocean. I was like
01:38:04 This is the most complex game I've ever made
01:38:07 This is as deep as video games can go wait. Why because it was like too far away and you had to like figure out how to get it
01:38:13 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
01:38:14 Yeah
01:38:15 Like like there is no deeper video game than pokemon snap. That is legitimately what I thought
01:38:21 Uh and trying to wake up that snorlax
01:38:25 And you have to replay every level you don't have to but like you go back
01:38:28 Yeah, and and to like snap them all pictures and snap snap. Yeah
01:38:33 Yeah, this is yeah pokemon is could be every fucking genre of every game all the time every made
01:38:39 Because it has the most diverse cast of characters ever created. Yes. Yes. And that's and that's it. What else can you even say?
01:38:46 Nothing, uh, what other video games franchise is you want to see in the switch? Oh, man
01:38:51 you um
01:38:53 Undertale
01:38:55 What are you telling me from play well on the switch? It would just play like any other game. Yeah, yeah be a jrpg
01:39:01 You know, yeah, yeah undertale under house. Definitely. So what definitely undertale needs to come to the switch so that a new generation can experience it
01:39:09 Yes
01:39:15 You're ripping up homestuck toby stop toby stop toby stop
01:39:19 Um, yeah, he did rip off homestuck with his own
01:39:23 His own composition
01:39:25 Maybe he ripped off undertale before it even existed. Yeah, you know what that fucking hack
01:39:29 Someone's ripping off something and it's both and both. Some ones are toby. Yeah, and there's never been a greater
01:39:35 Undertale uh ripoff than lisa. No, no no release a year earlier
01:39:42 But clearly he clearly clearly austin jorgensen got jorgensen
01:39:47 I don't he got into toby fox's like file notes and just like just like stuffed his pocket
01:39:53 And then bolted out
01:39:55 Well, he didn't bolt he did he like took out his samurai sword and like sliced the window pane in half
01:40:00 And then did like a kung fu ninja kick out of it because he's a fucking incredible superhuman god
01:40:06 And um unlike toby who was a ninja and then ninja ran all the way across the united states to california
01:40:13 Where I think he lives i'm probably wrong about that
01:40:15 But the name like that probably lives in fucking hell
01:40:19 Um, who's just california? Yeah, he's america. He's an american boy. He's a good american boy
01:40:25 As all he's an all he's an all american ninja. Yeah, the leader of the alt right
01:40:33 He would be he sounds like he could be the leader of the alt right, but no, he's a good boy and a sweet boy. Yeah, um, let's see
01:40:40 I I I want like fucking I want smash to be re-released, but good this time
01:40:46 Which which will not happen have they?
01:40:49 Oh, because like instead of all slow and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, um, yeah
01:40:53 They haven't said anything about a new smash. Have they they said that it is happening, but we don't know anything about it
01:40:58 I mean, it feels like smash 4 just came out
01:41:02 You'd say that but it came out three years ago
01:41:05 That's pretty short for a re-release of smash. I guess but yeah, I mean they could they could do it. Yeah
01:41:11 God, it came out three years ago. Yeah, Jesus
01:41:14 Fucking video games
01:41:16 Video games and life just don't like progress
01:41:19 The same timeline like the two happen completely separate from one another and like and like a week goes by and you look at video games
01:41:26 And like a century has gone by or vice versa or whatever
01:41:30 Like years later you look at you look at games and like they've just announced announced like the new generation of pokemon
01:41:37 Has like 50 new pokemon and that's all that they've done. Yeah
01:41:40 Ah
01:41:42 Our friend tom tom Oliver said the other day that he didn't want like there to be new pokemon in new pokemon games
01:41:49 That was very infuriating. It was the worst thing i've ever heard before in my life. He seemed
01:41:54 Well
01:41:56 First of all, I didn't understand at all like he okay
01:41:59 He seemed to be saying that other things were more important than new pokemon. First of all, no
01:42:04 Second of all, even if that were true, it doesn't mean that they couldn't make new pokemon
01:42:07 Like yeah, again, he was coming from it like there are more important things
01:42:11 They should focus on other things, but like they're fucking nintendo
01:42:14 They can do everything and once and once but always always in a state of rage about all the things that aren't being done
01:42:21 By nintendo the literal god of mankind. Yes
01:42:24 unironically our creator
01:42:26 Is
01:42:32 I'm gonna kill that nintendo. I'm gonna get him. I'm fucking calling up. I'm calling the intergalactic intergalactic space squad
01:42:39 To attend they're going to kill all of japan because it's too hard to distinguish them from another
01:42:44 I need to kill japan. I have to kill. I I have to kill japan before fully cooly 2 comes out
01:42:50 Maybe if I can if I can stop the monster that is nintendo at the same in one fell swoop
01:42:55 That'll be just dandy as well
01:42:58 If they do do a port of smash bros
01:43:00 First of all
01:43:02 It fuck dude
01:43:04 Second of all, which is like they really smash four on the switch. Yeah, I could see it like like like they're doing that with marikari
01:43:11 Is we gotta call marikari the ones. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I could see them doing
01:43:15 But they would have to get rid of monster hero sakurai
01:43:18 Be a sakurai is like 10 times worse than Miyamoto in the sense that he ruins game game series
01:43:25 How so?
01:43:26 Well, Miyamoto destroyed paper mario, but so sakurai I get feeling he literally unironically hates video games
01:43:36 Miyamoto definitely loves video games. Yeah, I don't think anyone
01:43:39 He's a coup. Even though his love is is his love is
01:43:44 Evil. Yes. His love is sick. Yeah. He has the mightest touch
01:43:48 The mightest touch like
01:43:51 That's a weird metaphor because like yeah, it turns it to gold, but also ruins it completely. Yeah, yeah, exactly
01:43:56 Yeah, I don't know. I honestly didn't mind like new like super paper mario
01:44:00 Still no no one claims that super paper mario super mario was awesome. Oh, well, what do you mean by he ruined it then?
01:44:06 There have been two games that come out for mario after woods like what?
01:44:11 Sick of star and fucking paint splash
01:44:14 Oh
01:44:16 Right. Yes. I don't think about those. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I forgot. I forgot. Yeah. I forgot those were paper marios
01:44:25 Yeah, they fucking aren't. Yeah, I don't know. I don't mind. I don't mind things like woolly world and epic yarn and sticker star
01:44:32 I don't mind them
01:44:34 but when like beautiful franchises like paper mario and kirby get
01:44:39 Like bastardized and those become what they are
01:44:43 Benefit well, okay
01:44:44 This meme has been perpetrated by you and your brother ben that epic yarn is not an amazing game
01:44:51 Is honestly disgusting in my hate. I never played it. I played like a little bit of it
01:44:57 I don't know. Okay. First of all, it's a it's a spin-off game. That is literally a one-off
01:45:01 But it's been like there haven't been another that's there hasn't been another main kirby game
01:45:06 since then
01:45:07 Right? Am I wrong? Are you in your own fucking universe?
01:45:12 Yes
01:45:14 Return to dreamland planet robo bot fucking triple deluxe
01:45:19 There's there's there's been more that I can't even fucking recount. There's been so many other games as well
01:45:23 Fucking rainbow curse, but have they resembled the kirby of my you? Yes. All of them have I don't know
01:45:30 Listen munchie. I don't know anything about video
01:45:33 All right, I don't I don't I don't research anything before I say it and I'm proud of that
01:45:38 I'm proud to spread misinformation and to base my and to base my my opinions and my beliefs solely on hearsay
01:45:47 and and complete and complete just invention just
01:45:52 internal invention of events
01:45:55 A totally self-constructive narrative that there's no relation at all to reality
01:46:01 And this is what you have to know about me. There has been not there's not been a game even similar to epic yarn in any conceivable way
01:46:09 In the kirby series since that day. Okay. All right. You know what? I don't mind epic yarn
01:46:13 My perception was that kirby was was like not doing
01:46:18 Powers and shit anymore. No, but I guess I'm wrong
01:46:22 Not at all
01:46:24 In every fucking way
01:46:26 Uh, we talked about this earlier and I said I want there to be more kirby games that are about the powers
01:46:33 And you didn't correct me that see I
01:46:36 I didn't think that was weird
01:46:37 But I thought you meant like really bring like the powers themselves to the forefront like in kirby 64
01:46:43 I do want that. I I do want that more
01:46:47 Yeah, I mean, I guess that is still fucking wrong
01:46:51 Okay, okay. Okay. Well. All right. So these new kirby games that I've never heard of and I have no idea
01:46:56 Do they I mean, do they have like what which which kirby games that I would know do they resemble?
01:47:01 But I like superstars or superstars
01:47:05 Superstar, okay. Yeah, are they like are they like that? Uh, they play exactly like that. Uh, do they have new powers?
01:47:10 Yes, well, okay, never mind then kirby's doing just fine. Yes. Kirby's doing exactly what I want
01:47:15 New powers and they've upgraded the old powers and there's so much more shit to do and
01:47:20 You're you you just have no no basis in reality. What's so I've I've been misled for years
01:47:27 And and it's a I'm in a cage of my own ignorance my own self-exposing
01:47:30 Kirby's never gone came in like 2010, right? Yeah, I know it's pretty old by now. Yeah, but it's okay
01:47:36 What what can I say? It's like it's like the last it's like the last kirby game that I heard like major press coverage about
01:47:42 That's that's the only thing I can say in my defense
01:47:46 I mean
01:47:47 You do live in a trash can bin so that is easily you would not hear the news about these current video games
01:47:54 Look, I'm too busy scavenging for sustenance to pay attention to video game journalism
01:47:59 Well, I'm looking right now on my fucking phone. I'm getting all the kirby games released since kirby's epic yarn. Look, okay
01:48:07 Let me just I'm just admitting that you're completely right and I've been completely wrong this whole time
01:48:12 I I know but from my own sick interest
01:48:14 I I want to I want to destroy you even more like the last the last time I formed an opinion was when
01:48:22 Kirby's epic yarn was the newest kirby game and I was like man
01:48:24 I wish kirby would go back to its roots and then I never thought about it again
01:48:29 Okay, kirby mass attack kirby's return to dreamland kirby triple deluxe kirby and the rainbow kerb
01:48:35 Kirby planet robobot all of those have been completely in the fucking style of of super star besides um
01:48:43 What's it called mess attack? What console are they on?
01:48:46 They're on all of them such as the ds the we the we use 3ds. Maybe I'll get the one which ones through 3ds
01:48:53 There too. There's triple deluxe and there is planet robobot. Maybe I'll get one. I love Kirby. Uh, Kirby's the best game in
01:49:00 Yeah, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. Um
01:49:02 Uh, fuck you
01:49:05 What
01:49:08 I'm the worst. You know what would be would be a really like like a really funny joke by nintendo. What's that if they released?
01:49:15 um
01:49:16 Say a star fox game or a metroid game or a f0 game or a donkey kong game or a yoshi game
01:49:23 Go on
01:49:25 Um, you know how like those guys are like the original aid smash bros and like they were kind of like like a big deal
01:49:31 Yeah, you know they used to have like game produced for them. Yeah. Oh, you're saying they don't yeah
01:49:37 Okay, okay. Maybe this yeah, this is part of I guess I just assumed Kirby was part of that trend of like beloved franchises
01:49:44 That don't get games anymore. Yeah. No, I guess that because yeah, like other games are like that
01:49:49 I mean, they are making dk games, but like
01:49:52 Very slowly. Yeah, like well, I I don't think
01:49:56 They did make a dk platformer like just yeah, yeah, uh by just recently if you meet in 2012 then yes
01:50:03 No, no, there was one that was like you played it with like a drum
01:50:07 But that one was that was in like 2005 then what no
01:50:15 That's bullshit. It was on the fucking game queue
01:50:19 That's not true. That that is what it is. That's the most recent dk game. I can even remember
01:50:25 No, no, I know that wait, there was a plat. There was a dk platformer in 2012. Yes
01:50:33 I don't own a nintendo console. I don't play video games
01:50:39 What have I been talking about?
01:50:41 What have I even been talking about? I only I only care about pokemon. Yeah, the only gaming news I pay attention to is pokemon
01:50:48 It's it's sad, but it's true
01:50:51 Yeah, but but uh star fox got a game like a year ago. I think oh, yeah, and it was terrible
01:50:57 Uh, it was literally star fox 64 again in hd. But wasn't it didn't have like awful controls? I hear that
01:51:04 Yeah, I yeah, I do I know about that one
01:51:07 um, so
01:51:08 What what's funny is after star fox 64 people always claim that star fox has just been shit after that point
01:51:14 However star fox, I think it's command. It's either commander
01:51:18 The the one where you're the one where it's a star fox game again
01:51:22 That's fucking awesome. Uh, when was that? Uh, it was in 2000 and in like six. I think okay
01:51:29 Um around like early. So it just is another star fox in the vein of the original. Yes. Yeah
01:51:35 Nobody talks about it. Uh, they must all be suffering from my same delusion of like video games ended after I turned like 19
01:51:42 And then everything else has just kind of been spinning it's wheels
01:51:46 And I won't bother to learn otherwise. Yes
01:51:49 But it's like the exact same predicament with xd go of darkness like people are like complaining about it
01:51:54 But if you just play the video games in the series, then you would know
01:51:58 Why would I ever play a video game? I mean, it's like Nate was talking about kingdom hearts
01:52:03 He gave his kingdom hearts lecture and like I'd never fucking heard of like half of those kingdom hearts
01:52:08 But just because I don't own the consoles. I mean, I don't I don't have a we or we use so
01:52:13 Yeah, I didn't know about anything anything that came out of those. I only just recently got a 3ds
01:52:17 I had a ds before but I never played anything on it. Um, um,
01:52:21 Except pokemon
01:52:25 Okay, i'm a consumerist pig
01:52:28 Or i'm the i'm actually the opposite of that because I don't buy things except for the one thing that I buy that everyone else buys
01:52:34 Yes, yes, excellent. Yeah, uh, there has been a yoshi game recently new yoshi sound
01:52:39 I literally have only heard intense negatives about it
01:52:42 Why what's wrong with it?
01:52:44 Uh, I hear the the controls are unresponsive. It looks like she it sounds like completely
01:52:49 Uh, there's there's one song that's been reposted a lot that literally sounds like someone ripping ass over and over again
01:52:57 Okay, yes
01:52:59 um, and it I and they also just say it shreds old water and there's nothing there's nothing even on me
01:53:05 What game does it most resemble will yoshi's islands? Yes
01:53:10 People like that one. Uh, yes, but it doesn't have to he doesn't have to see martin. Yeah, he's a classic classic game
01:53:18 What i'm seeing i'm serious. I know but the new not related to anything we're saying classic game yoshi's island nine out of ten
01:53:27 But switched by nintendo
01:53:29 um
01:53:30 Yeah, if they make a new game that's not shit and if they make a new metro game that is that that is a metro game and not
01:53:36 Like like four swords
01:53:40 I don't know. I don't even place four swords, but like it's like a
01:53:43 It's multiplayer, right? Yeah multiplayer is all that done. Have you heard what metroid federation places?
01:53:48 I have heard that it I've heard people that don't like it
01:53:52 I don't know what it is and I and I know that metroid is in a state where they just don't make any new metroid games
01:53:58 And fans try to make games that are like metroid and they get shut down. Yes. Yeah
01:54:03 garbage
01:54:05 metroid is
01:54:06 They're they're too much for games. They're the prime game is just like an fps. And then they're they leave it on my plate
01:54:10 They're like essentially. Yeah. Yeah
01:54:12 uh
01:54:13 Federation force is a
01:54:16 A I'm pretty sure like over the top third person shooter co-op game featuring
01:54:22 NPCs for pbs games not NPCs as in nameable characters, but as
01:54:28 Generic soldier from from prime. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah all those beloved characters
01:54:34 That I've never heard of interacting with no metroids
01:54:39 characters
01:54:40 Is ridley there? He's the only metroid character I could name. I I don't think so. He's gotta be in there somewhere
01:54:47 Maybe somewhere in there
01:54:50 Uh, why do people hate federation force?
01:54:54 Uh, because it's nothing like any other metroid game. It looks and plays badly
01:54:59 Uh, I don't know if it plays badly, but it looks like a complete shit
01:55:02 And we've been starving for a new game for so long
01:55:05 And they they're like it literally seems like they had just slapped on metroid to another game
01:55:10 That's nothing to do with it. Is it coming out for the switch?
01:55:13 No, it's gonna have to
01:55:15 It was enough. It was announced a really long time ago. Oh, I don't know. I think honest to god
01:55:21 I think the backlash was so big that they just can't
01:55:25 I see
01:55:26 Uh, I don't it might be out that happens sometimes where I like that one game in war
01:55:31 It was like I heard a lot of game and what game and wario for the oh like game and watch but little wario
01:55:37 Uh, I I heard a lot of like like press about it. Yeah, and then like two months later. I was like, hey, wait
01:55:42 Game and worry. Let me look that up. It released like like a month ago. I heard fucking nothing about it. Yeah
01:55:48 Oh
01:55:49 That reminds me game that needs to come to the nintendo switch
01:55:54 No
01:55:56 My favorite game and munchies too
01:56:00 I hate overwatch. Uh overwatch is the worst video game ever made
01:56:03 I've never played it and I never will because I hate it
01:56:06 I hate how it looks like a pixar movie and I hate how it is focused tested to a mirror shine
01:56:11 And I hate that everyone loves it and if you and everyone that loves it is just uh, he's just been duped
01:56:17 You're just a corporate shill. You've been you've been tricked
01:56:20 You've been tricked into liking the game by the fact that they made it so you would like it
01:56:24 God damn it's not not only does it's aesthetic
01:56:28 Uh, it's aesthetic
01:56:30 Be awful. I also don't like I mean some of the character designs are kind of neat. I guess but the overall aesthetic is dumb and bland
01:56:37 Everything visual about overwatch is terrible. Not only that though the game itself. I think some of them would look cool in other games
01:56:45 like
01:56:47 Bastion
01:56:49 mercy
01:56:52 I think in a in a game that I think in another game
01:56:55 Mercy's like robo wings would be really sweet. Yeah, you know what maybe yeah, but but by and large everything visual better than
01:57:04 Yeah, uh
01:57:05 But the game the gameplay it has very highly
01:57:08 That's a highly controversial opinion that no one will agree with us on but we both feel it really strong
01:57:13 Yeah, it looks very that it looks stupid and we hate it
01:57:18 It does have graphical fidelity. Oh, it's got it's got graphical fidelity in space
01:57:23 It's like i'm right there with all my favorite characters such as a girl. Um, fast girl
01:57:30 There's like a robot dude robot dude and big big pig. Yeah, and big pig my favorite
01:57:36 Big hook guy big big fat guy. He's he's there with him
01:57:42 And I just hate I just hate how it was the subject of so much
01:57:46 controversy about nothing meeting up to its release and it all just propelled itself to just massive success
01:57:52 On the back of the fact that it was focused tested to be something that you the idiot consumer would buy because it looks like other things
01:57:59 You like yes
01:58:00 Not only that but the gameplay itself is so fucking like like dumb down and casual
01:58:06 I've never played it. Okay, and I never will but I believe I have played it
01:58:09 Extensively and and I have a somewhat high sr
01:58:13 Uh, which is like the record
01:58:16 If you compare every single individual like aspect about it to tf2
01:58:22 I know i'm gonna sound like an asshole for sandals, but tf2 is just so much better than it in every fucking way
01:58:27 In like like visual and gameplay. It's pre fucking boggling. Uh, I do like tf2
01:58:33 Although well, I liked it. See I stopped playing it before there were even hats
01:58:37 So like I don't even know what's going on with tf2. Uh, tf2 is a completely different situation in which I
01:58:44 I will have a listen buddy where I talk to myself about how much I hate tf2 and then I will also defend I will also defend tf2
01:58:52 Just to summarize the maps are fucking indecipherable and indecipherable that in tf2. No in in
01:58:59 Uh, and all of them boiled down choke points and all of all of the capture points and I'm objectives are very big
01:59:08 And this seems like a minute detail
01:59:11 But this allows the this is this allows timer stall
01:59:15 And and ask someone who plays pokebomb, then I'm sure you can come. Do you know what timer stall is?
01:59:20 um in overwatch not really I guess
01:59:24 Just running down the clock while your team is still in the lead
01:59:28 Uh, basically what you do is uh do the mechanics of how control points work
01:59:33 if one person is on a
01:59:35 a
01:59:36 A point and keep in mind in tf2 the points are like the size of maybe three people
01:59:41 Yeah, I don't watch they are the size of maybe 50 people. Mm-hmm. And uh
01:59:47 If just one person, uh, like like say you're on blue team and you're attacking red team, uh, red team is defending
01:59:52 Yeah, if you're on the final point of red and literally every single human on blue is on red's point if just one red
02:00:01 Uh, like let's say may the worst example
02:00:05 May has an ability where you can shoot up a an ice wall and that takes like 250 health to destroy that
02:00:12 Which is somewhat much you team has to focus on very
02:00:15 Very fast. Okay. Okay. It's going to take like at least like three seconds, which is a lot
02:00:21 So it sounds like what you're saying is that
02:00:23 That the the points are so large that like the defending team like it's just impossible to control the point
02:00:30 Enough to not get the fucking defending team to just be jumping on it and like fucking around and like it's unfairly favors the defender
02:00:37 Yes, yes, and and every it is a slow
02:00:41 Slug and and just go back to main because it angers me. So once the ice wall is down
02:00:46 She can like freeze yourself and ice and make her invincible, right? Yeah, and just capture and just keep the point for six fucking seconds
02:00:53 Yeah
02:00:54 Yeah, I see and then once she's done, I see. Yeah
02:00:58 That's that's fucking me
02:01:01 What that may literally says that
02:01:03 Oh
02:01:04 Oh, no
02:01:06 Oh, no
02:01:07 Uh, then then by that time her team has already
02:01:11 Respond and come back because there are like there are so little respond games
02:01:17 Like respond time
02:01:19 And if you have two
02:01:20 If you're defending
02:01:22 Uh, and and the blue team is at or yeah, yeah, the blue team is at the last point
02:01:26 You will have a response I can have like
02:01:28 Like 14 seconds. Mm-hmm. These those seconds really fucking matter in fps fps is are like like a millisecond millisecond games
02:01:37 Did they matter but over watched they're like six seconds at most
02:01:42 Which means that you death is so inconsequential in that game
02:01:45 You can just jump right back into the fray with basically like like no like scratches on it won't be that
02:01:53 It's off I can go on and on about how that game is so fucking poorly designed balanced
02:01:58 I've heard I've heard you talk at length about it. Yeah, and I just I just hate it entirely on principle
02:02:04 Yeah, like I don't have any actual arguments against it other than my feelings. Yeah, which are strong. Yeah, it should be considered valid by all
02:02:11 um, but yeah
02:02:13 Um, come to the switch, please. I love or watch my favorite game of 2015. Yeah, um, and it will be my favorite game of 2017
02:02:21 guaranteed
02:02:23 If you just rerelease it and just put just put even more unnecessary bullshit
02:02:28 I love it. Please put in uh, even more micro transactions and uh
02:02:34 just
02:02:35 Blizzard, please just come and fucking read me. It's just while I'm asleep. Just come and just and just destroy my ass
02:02:44 Pikmin
02:02:45 Pikmin, uh, I played Pikmin 2 Pikmin 2 is the best game ever made. I've never played a Pikmin. I
02:02:51 It's kind of a thing, right? It's kind of a thing they keep doing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
02:02:56 It's all right
02:02:57 Um, Pikmin 2 is about money
02:03:00 Is it and and and greed like by the producers or in the game in the game? Okay
02:03:06 Uh
02:03:07 This is not like a hugely popular franchise. Oh, no
02:03:11 Uh, the first Pikmin is your your name and all maria crash land on the like a planet and there's like the command name
02:03:15 Like they help you but we load your ship and you go back to space
02:03:19 Uh in Pikmin 2 it picks up right as soon as you land on your home planet and and like the the the company you work for
02:03:26 Is like, uh while you were gone our company is is it got foreclosed and we're out we're bankrupt now
02:03:33 And you're like, oh fuck
02:03:35 that's not good
02:03:37 and then uh like like you like like
02:03:40 In Pikmin you like pick up trash
02:03:43 and and so like Pikmin uh all mar is like, oh, uh, also I think like like a bio cap and then
02:03:49 Nice, and I think that's literally the item they use as well
02:03:53 And then the like the ceo's like that's worth fucking five trillion dollars on this plane
02:03:59 Because he picked up a bottle cap on Pikmin world
02:04:02 Okay, and then and then he's like you have to go back to Pikmin world and mine it for all of its resources
02:04:08 In order to reclaim our company. I see and then you proceed to do that and it's awesome
02:04:14 Cool, you just destroy all the natural wildlife and just take all of the treasures from from the planet
02:04:20 Grace
02:04:22 That's pretty good. And you use the Pikmin to do so. It's it's it's incredible. This sounds this sounds radical. Hey, is there a new uh
02:04:30 Uh, what about animal crossing?
02:04:34 Uh, I'm shocked that they didn't reveal a new animal crossing. Actually, I don't know when the last animal crossing was 2013
02:04:39 Okay, they could do another one. Hey digi
02:04:43 We're talking about we're talking about Kirby extensive. Yeah
