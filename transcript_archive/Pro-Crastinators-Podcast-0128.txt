00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another fantastic, amazing, jammed,
00:00:29 impact, scandal-ridden episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am Tom Oliver, introing
00:00:38 the episode today, and with us we have the master of disaster himself, Munchy J. Trump.
00:00:45 This is a true anecdote. Every single time I open up Audacity Recorded PCP, I'm like
00:00:49 today, like I'm kind of low energy, I don't really want to, you know, like I don't really
00:00:52 want to be crazy, I don't want to scream or anything. I'm just going to take this PCP
00:00:56 chill and it's going to be a chill PCP. And then whenever the intro, whenever Nate's
00:00:59 like welcome to the PCP, I just get that fucking fire in me. I just have to ruin the episode
00:01:04 with my interjections. The low energy of Gibb seeps out of you and the high energy of Trump
00:01:10 seeps in. Yes, yes, yes. And on that note, please clap for Nate. Please clap. I need that
00:01:21 validation. We got Ben St with us as well. Hey guys, hey guys, sorry I haven't been on
00:01:30 a PCP in a while. I've been really busy with life stuff. Sorry if my voice sounds weird.
00:01:35 I'm kind of sick. That's actually true. I woke up today with a terribly sore throat.
00:01:39 I know it's going to get worse. I'm sipping on some hot tea, hot tea featuring apple cider
00:01:44 vinegar with quote the mother, which is a very spooky thing for an apple cider vinegar
00:01:50 bottle to say. The mother is apparently some kind of set of organic compounds that are filtered
00:01:56 out in the non organic in like the non raw. The translation we never got. Yeah, yeah. Instead
00:02:04 it was distilled and shoved into apple cider vinegar. That reminds me of that movie with
00:02:10 Jay Lawrence, mother, you know, the one she looks so hard. Oh, I'm sorry. Dwayne the
00:02:15 Rock Johnson. How was that? I hear it was the worst movie ever. No, no, no, I know I
00:02:20 watched it. It was great. They had the guns in the movie. There's a whole first person
00:02:25 sequence at the end. That sounds kind of cool, like a hardcore Henry style sequence. Yeah,
00:02:31 but like 10 years before that. Weird to have it like in an otherwise non first person movie.
00:02:37 No, it's like at the end and if you're watching the movie and you're like, oh, but where's the
00:02:41 video game? Then you see like, Oh, there it is. Like the very end. They finally like the very
00:02:47 end of this two hour movie. They finally give you what you've been waiting for and make you feel
00:02:51 like you're playing a video game. You know what they missed? You know, we didn't get with that.
00:02:55 We didn't get doom the movie the game. I would write. It's just it's just a modified wad of doom
00:03:02 like the original, but they replaced doom guys face with a pixelated version of the Rock's face.
00:03:06 Yeah. This is what every like the movie of the game thing is. It's just like it's a third person,
00:03:14 like almost collectifon, but like linear. Like a weird mesh of genres that don't compliment one
00:03:20 other very well. It's terrible. So I'm just imagining like this really like super saturated,
00:03:25 like chibi doom guy running around collecting jiggy pieces for only for the Game Boy Advance.
00:03:31 Doom guy Kazooie, the greatest platformer ever.
00:03:34 There's a series of Sam on Game Boy Advance. Yeah, it looks fucked as hell. It looks very
00:03:40 interesting. You know, I just happened to watch a slight update to my life. I actually have watched
00:03:45 a couple AVGN episodes recently. I'm changing my life in a positive way. And like, I'd seen like
00:03:52 one, but never was into the guy or had like, I know it's weird. It's weird. But I'd watch some of
00:04:00 a YouTube or not been into AVGN. I was into John Tron that I just like got into the game late.
00:04:05 I think yeah, like I think I was probably in like college when AVGN started getting big and I just
00:04:10 kind of missed the boat on it. I went back like maybe a year or two ago and marathoned a lot of
00:04:15 it just sort of on the playlist and I feel that coming for me one of these days. Sorry. But I was
00:04:20 just saying that there's a he did a Tomb Raider episode and there's a port of Tomb Raider one for
00:04:27 the Engage, the original PS1 game, which is fucking sick. I remember that was coming out that like
00:04:32 blew my mind that they could put that on a phone. It was crazy. It's a full fucking game. It is a
00:04:36 full game. Like portrait because the Engage screen was a portrait screen resolution and had like a
00:04:43 shitty little D pad. And apparently to get the game in this is fascinating. Okay, if you want to
00:04:47 put in a new game and you're fucking Engage, you pop off the back, take out the battery, put in like
00:04:53 the SD card behind the battery, put the battery back in, close it, and then you're ready to game.
00:04:57 That's because you're playing you're playing the bullshit taco Engage. You need to get the Engage
00:05:02 QD, the remaster version that's better. They redesigned it. It's sick. Is it really sick? Are
00:05:08 you lying to our audience? No, it's fucking shit. It's an Engage and I unironically want to own on
00:05:14 one day. But yeah, you know, do you know how you took phone calls on the original Engage? You had
00:05:18 to hold it on the side. So you had to like hold it like it's basically like if you had an iPhone
00:05:23 and like you put the edge with the buttons up to your ear to talk to it. That's how you talked on
00:05:27 an Engage. It was ridiculous. It was the worst thing of all time. And I want one horribly badly.
00:05:34 Speaking of SD cards, I just bought I just bought on a total whim. I bought Omega Ruby about
00:05:40 Pokemon Omega Ruby. Steve's got some choice words to say about that game. Yeah, I think the whole
00:05:46 world's in choice things to say that. How do you like that battle frontier? How are you enjoying it?
00:05:50 I haven't actually used it yet. I haven't actually played any of it. It's a joke. There's a battle
00:05:55 frontier isn't in it. Oh, I almost fell for it. I almost said, oh, yeah, it's pretty good. It's got
00:06:01 some problems. You know, it's flawed, but it's a pretty good. No, I don't know. Shut up. I hear
00:06:10 it's not good is what I hear. Is that true, ladies and gentlemen? I mean, I've heard people say
00:06:15 that it's the best. Like, I have seen people. Okay, maybe it was just a joke, but it seemed like
00:06:21 on 4chan, like on Oh, that's a joke. That's a joke. That's a real joke. Is it really? Okay. No,
00:06:29 yeah, it's not well loved. They absolutely hate that game. They think it's the worst. Do people
00:06:34 prefer like the actual Gen three games to the Omega remix? Yeah, they prefer. I fucked up. Yeah. Yeah,
00:06:42 whatever. You I think you literally have fell for a meme. I think you saw one thread that was like,
00:06:48 dude, why can't we go back to Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire? You read the title and then all the
00:06:52 replies saying that that game of shit and you're like, you know what, like, I just read it. This was
00:06:57 like a couple years ago. I think I just read a thread of people being like, what's the best gen
00:07:01 and like a lot of people were in there saying Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire. So I just thought, huh, I
00:07:06 guess those are pretty popular. Zoomers left and right, love and Omega, whatever. Alpha, whatever.
00:07:12 They need to be killed. We need to call the also we have to stop human progress. Do you remember
00:07:17 when you get like to like this, the sixth gym, like you just get to the second part of the game,
00:07:21 and then out of nowhere, like not in the original game, just like out of nowhere. Laudiasse shows up
00:07:27 and it's like, Hey, do you want to capture me? Oh God. Yeah, I know that that happens and it makes
00:07:32 me mad. Is that the one where someone just gives you a Lucario to that's not that's in gen six. Okay,
00:07:40 no, I meant X and Y. Yeah, that's in Lucario on that. And X and Y. You know, okay, okay, that's the
00:07:51 one I skipped. But the real is someone gives you an egg that has real in it. So I feel it's
00:07:54 slightly better at least work to get a sort of I guess like, I don't know. Yeah, like, didn't they
00:08:00 give you an EV egg in the original game in gen one, right? Gen one doesn't have eggs. It doesn't. No,
00:08:07 there's no eggs in gen one. There's no breeding. I know there's no breeding. Whenever you get it,
00:08:14 you get an EV from somebody if you go in like the back. Oh, they give you an EV egg and sun and
00:08:19 moon. What are we talking about? Isn't there like graffiti in one of the buildings where you can get
00:08:23 the EV egg? I think if you like clicking on the walls and you can read like someone was here. Is
00:08:28 that true? Yeah, like a meme program? Like the bloods were here, like the crypts were here.
00:08:34 Oh, how could I forget about that? The blood reds and the crypt blues, the legendary rivalry. Hey,
00:08:42 all this talk of Pokemon's getting me really anxious. Let me take a long sip of my off brand
00:08:46 LaCroix here and just relax for a second. Oh, my God, Nate, I just come up with some totally
00:08:51 organic natural conversation star point based on you drinking that LaCroix. Like just like you
00:08:57 drinking that drink and maybe think of a totally organic thing to say currently busly like continue.
00:09:04 There's a lawsuit against LaCroix. It's happening. It can't be. No. So tell me the deets. What's
00:09:12 that? Is it about cancer? Does it cause cancer? Is that something? Everything does. Okay, okay. Yes,
00:09:17 but but more like it will kill you. Like not like like in a cancer. Can I just point out? Can I just
00:09:23 point out what the fuck? No, it has been so bizarre to see these from zero to a hundred like spread
00:09:28 of LaCroix over the last like year or two. I no idea how that happened or even why anyone buys it,
00:09:34 including me. Why do you buy it? It's slightly it's slightly more pleasant than just drinking water
00:09:43 slightly worse. And then the other thing is the convenience of just grabbing a can of something
00:09:50 I agree 100% that is the only reason I buy it is because I'm conditioned to like can drinks. Yeah. And
00:09:56 this is just a way of weaning myself off like the poison that is the first time I ever had it. What
00:10:01 was it? Ben's house in Atlanta and I drank it and and and he was like, what do you think? And I was
00:10:06 like, I okay. I don't really like it's okay. Nobody likes LaCroix. I have I have negative
00:10:16 associations with LaCroix. But mostly I just like I like soda better. And like, I don't think
00:10:22 soda is poison. Tom like it has flavor. It's not keto, though. Isn't it poison? Oh, God,
00:10:30 this is my fucking pet peeve. People don't fucking understand what diet soda is. Oh my God,
00:10:36 they're everywhere. They're everywhere. Infecting society. It's so simple. I want to know sugar
00:10:43 in diet soda. Is it not real soda or something? How is it not real soda? It's it's like gay. What
00:10:51 Nate would say if it's you can't have diet and soda at the same time. It's not what it is. It
00:10:56 not made of like so like sugar derivatives that just yeah. Yeah, sure. But that doesn't count
00:11:03 because you don't digest them. I mean, I guess so. No, no, no, I guess so. There's no fucking
00:11:13 gray hair here. Well, okay, I mean, okay, if I have if I have like a four piece puzzle, and I
00:11:20 remove one of the pieces, I still have the three pieces, can I really say this isn't the puzzle
00:11:25 anymore? That's an insane thing. That's the word. I don't I don't deny what you're saying at all. It
00:11:33 is 100% true that diet soda is fine. But like, if I had this right, is this like a big thing that
00:11:39 happens all the time? If I raised my son to be in the military, my beautiful baby boy, I cut off
00:11:45 his legs, would he not be my son anymore? Ben, why are you taking this position, Ben? What's wrong
00:11:51 with you monster? It's like, it's like, I don't know. It's like if people thought that like,
00:11:59 there really were like little people in the in the television. And you're just like, and you're
00:12:06 like, no, you see, it's just an image, right? Like, it's just an image projected on the screen. And
00:12:11 people are like, and people are like, yeah, I guess you're right. But but but you know, it's kind
00:12:17 of like, it's kind of like there's little people in the television, right? Like, no, you're an idiot.
00:12:27 Okay, look, all that really matters is so so just consuming this in any way interfere with the
00:12:33 whole point of ketosis and the whole keto. Some people don't play well with certain artificial
00:12:39 sweeteners. So for some people, it might yeah, Tom was asking me about heavy cream before the
00:12:44 stream. But but for some people, artificial sweeteners aren't good for keto, but it depends on the
00:12:49 person. And in general, yeah, they're fine. As like, I think keto is becoming Ben's equivalent to
00:12:56 holocaust.
00:13:01 No, this is my anger is not it's not a keto thing. It's just like munchy.
00:13:05 It's that old keto rage. You're not innocent. You're not innocent. Because like, I talked to I
00:13:11 talked to you and and Kazi about like soda and you both did like a thing that was like, I don't
00:13:16 know if you're still doing it. But you were like, yeah, we're both cutting out soda, because like
00:13:19 soda, you know, is bad for you because of sugar. And I'm like, what about diet soda doesn't have
00:13:24 any sugar? And you both are like, yeah, but it's still soda. Like there's still kind of little
00:13:30 people in the television. So the only reason I don't want to drink diet soda is because I don't
00:13:35 like the way that it tastes like universally. Okay, well, that's a whole that's all right. That's
00:13:39 a whole other can of worms. And I don't understand people that think the diet soda tastes bad.
00:13:44 But I know that that's like taste like that's just up to an individual. So I can't argue with
00:13:48 that. I don't understand it. But I can't argue with nothing but water and juice for years. And
00:13:53 then like, like Michelle turned me on to La Croix, we've been getting that for a little while,
00:13:56 you know, La Croix variants or whatever. And like, I feel like it is a gateway to soda. Like
00:14:01 because I'm drinking these, I'm way more likely. But it's like, it's like vaping, right? Like, yeah,
00:14:07 you could argue that vaping is like a gateway to smoking. But you can also say that like if you
00:14:11 smoke, like drink soda, and you can vape instead. And maybe it has like none of the negative, maybe
00:14:17 you can replace the one bad thing with this less bad thing that doesn't have the negative side
00:14:22 effects. Go that way. It's all about your perspective. But if you're already straight edge,
00:14:26 then like why even entertain any of these? Vaping could be a gateway to smoking. Why
00:14:29 could I change the drinking calories life? Yeah. Vaping could be a gateway to smoking. I would
00:14:33 never drink a calorie except for heavy cream. But vaping could also be a gateway to quitting,
00:14:38 depending on which way you look at. Well, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, like, okay, for a smoker,
00:14:42 getting into vaping could definitely be a step in the right direction. Exactly. To like a healthier
00:14:46 life. You guys in your fuel, I want the post food life to be like calories or individual,
00:14:52 like Cheerios. And each Cheerio is one calorie. And you just count them out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:56 And you count them out exactly 2000 different mornings. Yeah. And then I can divide each meal
00:15:01 by 10. So it's easy to multiply and slash or divide. So my breakfast could be like 100 calories.
00:15:06 I do have my fuel right with me right now, as a matter of fact, incidentally. I'm on my second
00:15:11 up. I restocked recently, by the way. So I've got two more bags fresh, ready to go, feeling good.
00:15:17 We actually returned to the LeCroy lawsuit. I just want to chill. I just want to chill for some
00:15:21 of the free advertising for tea. If you are like wanting to get out the soda life, I highly recommend
00:15:28 tea is tea is the best food. It is the talking about like, I'm drinking tea right now. As I said,
00:15:35 tea with apple cider vinegar with the mother is great. I was right the whole time. He tea is
00:15:43 the best. There was prep work, though, that a lot of people are too. Oh, no, very little,
00:15:47 very like like a 10 minutes, you know, you can take like, you can do this is what me and my
00:15:53 housemates do. We have like a big like a big mason jar, like a gallon mason jar. And we put
00:15:58 tea bags in it and you can put it in the fridge and let it steep. And like by the next day,
00:16:03 you'll have like cold brew tea. And you can make and you don't have to like spend any time.
00:16:07 The danger there is oversteeping. Because if you oversteep, it gets really bitter.
00:16:14 What I do is I have a David's tea seeper and I can just it's a super simple,
00:16:18 like streamlined ice. I actually enjoy ice tea more. I actually enjoy my tea cold more often.
00:16:25 I'm just drinking hot today because of my throat. Yeah, I almost only. I mean, what I would do when
00:16:29 I wanted to make like ice tea or iced coffee, because like back at my other house, we had
00:16:35 we had one of those water like coolers, but it had hot and cold water. You had balls. So what
00:16:42 you would do is you would just take the hot water, you'd steep the tea in that really quickly,
00:16:47 and then you just mix that with the cold water and then we get iced really quickly.
00:16:51 I want to tell my my first my first interaction with LaCroix. Nate, do you remember Alex,
00:16:57 our cousin Alex's wedding? You were there. Yeah, a nightmare. I don't think I was there,
00:17:01 but I remember you weren't. Oh, I was there. I hated it. It was horrible. Okay, I believe you.
00:17:05 But they had, but they had LaCroix. I'd never seen LaCroix before, but they had LaCroix.
00:17:10 And, you know, I think something was going on. I was like kind of over in a building. I was going
00:17:14 out to like go back to the tent that everyone was fucking around in or whatever. And I, I grabbed
00:17:19 a LaCroix thinking that because it has like a fruit flavor, right? It says like, oh, you know,
00:17:23 pear or whatever. And I was like, okay, in the factory where LaCroix is canned, like elsewhere,
00:17:28 in like a separate section, they're like processing fruit. Like that's how they make LaCroix. Yeah,
00:17:33 yeah. So, you know, I started drinking it and I'm like, well, God, because I am expecting something
00:17:37 sweet and like pear flavor, but it's only it's something that's just sort of smells like a pear,
00:17:41 but it doesn't taste like anything. Why that was what I was about to bring up next. How can
00:17:45 something that smells as good as LaCroix tastes so disappointing? Yeah, like it's a fucking trap.
00:17:51 So I went. So I went to the, this was pre keto, obviously, I went to the bar, like there was an
00:17:56 open bar, but it had been like abandoned because like, you know, the like dinner was about to start.
00:18:01 And I just went behind the bar. It was an outdoor thing. And I just grabbed some grenadine and like
00:18:06 just poured some grenadine into it to try and sweeten it. Someone thought I was trying to spike
00:18:10 my drink, but I was like, no, I'm just trying to make this LaCroix taste like real. So drink,
00:18:15 huh? Like a problem? Like, were they like, Hey, don't spike. No, they love, no, no, they laugh.
00:18:20 They're like, huh, trying to get trying to get wasted. I was like, no, just just kind of doesn't
00:18:24 taste very good. It is a wedding where people do drink, but okay, whatever. Yeah, no, no,
00:18:29 they weren't criticizing me. They were just like, haha, this guy is about drinking. It was like,
00:18:36 you and me, buddy.
00:18:39 Yep. So that's it. Best smelling LaCroix, best smelling LaCroix passion fruit. The LaCroix
00:18:46 lawsuit is that LaCroix is sparkling water and people are saying that that is false
00:18:51 advertisement because it says that LaCroix is a natural drink. It is advertised as a
00:18:57 natural drink. They're saying that sparkling water is not natural.
00:19:03 The carbonation is artificially added.
00:19:05 Yes. But we're talking about natural ingredients.
00:19:08 They're saying to carbonate it, they have to use pesticides and stuff like that.
00:19:12 All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the whole thing. There's like a chemical from like
00:19:18 cockroach insecticide that they use in LaCroix and people are really upset about it.
00:19:22 Okay. Now, I'll be happy to hear people out and see if this lawsuit goes forward. But like,
00:19:27 for example, there's also probably like, you know, carbon in like some like poison and then like,
00:19:34 hey, there's also carbon in the stuff that we eat every day. That's fucked up, dude. It's the
00:19:38 same shit that's in poison. You know, so like. I don't think the claim is that it's poisonous.
00:19:43 I think the claim is that it's artificial. This sounds like somebody in California
00:19:48 really just wants some money. That sounds like somebody in California really just thinks GMOs
00:19:52 are real. Yeah, this is my mom. My mom is the one with this lawsuit.
00:19:57 I gotta tell, there's like some of the stuff I don't want to say, but okay, like I'll just say
00:20:01 that like I have stories of people I know that like, for example, they work in like the food
00:20:06 industry and like there are people who come up and say like, does this have GMOs and they'll be
00:20:13 like, no, um, has it touched anything that had GMOs? And if the answer is maybe or yes, they're
00:20:19 like, well, then I'm not going to consume that. No, thank you, sir. Like even even being in proximity
00:20:25 to things like, do they have people know what a GMO is? They clearly do not poison you guys.
00:20:34 Is there's genetically modified GMOs in it? There's literally no reason.
00:20:38 Like, like, like, what do they think is going to happen? Like if you touch something that's
00:20:41 genetically modified, your genes get modified. Like, I think people, I think GMO just equals bad.
00:20:51 Is it like, is it like an ethical thing? Like, they just don't think we should be fucking with
00:20:55 nature. I shouldn't eat literally anything because there's literally nothing that we eat that we have
00:21:00 not genetically bred to be. What kind of person like would would not want to eat something that
00:21:07 had touched GMO on, like, ethical grounds as opposed to like, it seems like a health one to
00:21:12 be doing. My mom, my mom is this person, 100%. She is full stop like everything that is bad about
00:21:20 like that mentality. And you know what, even if in 50 years or 20 years or 10 years, one year,
00:21:27 whatever, if we prove that all GMOs are literally evil poison that are killing us 20 years early,
00:21:34 they still give no credit to the people freaking out about GMOs because they have no reason to
00:21:38 believe that. There's no way they could have actually known. They're just right by accident.
00:21:43 So I'm protecting myself from, told you so. I actually tried to talk to my mom about this because
00:21:48 she's super anti-GMO. And I was like, like, I was explaining to her that, you know, like, like,
00:21:53 this is nothing new. Humans do this sort of thing all the time. We're just doing it faster now. It's
00:21:58 the only distinction. And she just had, like, no response. But she just did like, well, like,
00:22:05 there's still little people in the TV like, yeah, sure. Like, it's still cancer.
00:22:10 Her soul, her soul retreated. Her soul faded from her eyes into the back of her skull that she just
00:22:15 heard, all around me are familiar faces. Yeah. That's what they do. That's, I don't know. It's
00:22:23 all a bunch of bullshit. Anyway. Do you think that LaCroix is false advertising? Do you think
00:22:27 that they deserve to be sued? I mean, if they're using, I mean, I don't know, what's the criteria
00:22:32 of naturalness? Like, what exactly does it mean? I'm going to go to Urban Dictionary and find out
00:22:37 right now. This will help. This will be very helpful. I'm sure the people on Urban Dictionary are big
00:22:43 LaCroix drinkers. I'm sure they are too. I'm sure that's actually true. Probably because they're big
00:22:47 lemurs. And it's kind of their big millennials. All right. I googled the proper terms,
00:22:53 all right, natural. Okay, this is now we don't want the noun one adjective.
00:22:58 Okay, no, that's not it either. Breasts that don't have implants. No, that's not it. I mean,
00:23:04 that is true. God damn it. These are all fucking nouns. Okay, no. Oh, does that mean that fake boobs
00:23:10 are GMOs? Yeah, exactly what it means. That and nothing. Okay, here we go. Number six down is
00:23:16 relevant. One, to be free of any superficial artificial media or society created additives.
00:23:24 Are we really using the Urban Dictionary definition to try and figure out, to try and like
00:23:29 decide this court case? What higher authority is there, Ben? To decide this court case against
00:23:32 against LaCroix? So you're like at the courtroom, the judge is like, hold on, before we proceed,
00:23:38 we must assess our definitions. And he pulls out his tiny little spectacles. The defense
00:23:44 Urban Dictionary defines it as, yeah. The prosecution calls for a sidebar. And like,
00:23:52 oh, it takes out their smartphone and shows this Urban Dictionary page. Well, you know,
00:23:55 the thing is, I pulled up the Google Dictionary one just now. The thing, there probably is a
00:24:02 very specific codified food, what's the food and drug administration, like definition of what
00:24:09 natural means. Like, for example, if you want to say that you have whole wheat, then like in your,
00:24:16 in your bread or whatever, if you make your bread company, you can have, as long as there's any
00:24:21 amount of whole wheat, it could be 99%, like white bread stuff, and then 1% whole wheat,
00:24:25 and you can get away with that. But specifically, the label of 100% whole wheat, which you should
00:24:30 always buy, ladies and gentlemen, buy the way, because that is better for you. Look for 100%
00:24:36 whole wheat. If it doesn't say 100%, it's probably 99% bullshit. That's just like filler.
00:24:41 Every time I think about the FDA, the only thing I can think about is this old Onion article,
00:24:46 that's like FDA and N, hold on, N, T, like the T, A, R, something.
00:24:58 It just matters. It's the food and drug administration and the like tobacco alcohol
00:25:04 and firearms administration, like get together to throw a rad party, and like the food and drug
00:25:09 administration, like we had tons of food and drugs, but nothing to smoke, drink, or fire.
00:25:19 So we got together with the Tobacco Alcohol and Firearms Association, and just,
00:25:23 and just threw a rager, and it was a great idea. Yeah. It's like the association of bad decisions.
00:25:31 And you combine them. I mean, if you're the smoking alcohol and firearms,
00:25:36 so yeah, just like nothing but bad calls all around.
00:25:40 There's the FDA, like it's the food and drug. So I imagine drugs are things like pharmaceuticals
00:25:45 and stuff. Is that like like hard drugs or something? Are they? No, dang dong. It's
00:25:50 that's like, they're the people that decide when like clinical testing has reached sufficient
00:25:54 like levels that like a drug is like sellable in stores. I just wonder if it was also under the
00:25:59 jurisdiction. No, because no, wait, like illegal drugs? Like no, they're illegal. Of course,
00:26:03 a government regulator doesn't have to regulate. Maybe they were the body chart of deciding what
00:26:06 should be illegal and what shouldn't. I mean, I don't know. Maybe they're involved in it. Maybe.
00:26:10 Well, there you go. All right. Well, we've said it in the Croy question. Yeah. Are they guilty or not guilty?
00:26:16 Absolutely guilty. Absolutely guilty. Absolutely guilty. Absolutely guilty.
00:26:21 The Croy is a crime against humanity as it stands. So even if, yeah, they're guilty of that,
00:26:27 hey, hey, speaking of groceries, I'm just going to gripe. I'm just going to gripe for a minute.
00:26:32 I've been trying to order my goddamn groceries. Like a couple of weeks ago, I ordered some groceries
00:26:39 on the internet. Instacart was the app I was using. Okay. And you know, it charges like a
00:26:47 little surcharge for the delivery, but like whatever it's really it saves me like two hours.
00:26:53 So it's great. Yeah. So I was trying to use it. And then today I go in and it's like a card
00:26:58 declined. And I'm like, well, I don't know why that would be because I just used my card yesterday
00:27:02 at a store and it worked fine. So I tried to pay with Google Pay instead, which did it. I put the
00:27:07 same card in Google Pay accepted my card. I hit send. And it's like, and it's like, internet
00:27:13 doesn't work. The internet obviously works because I'm using the app in the first place, like internet
00:27:18 seems to not be connected. It's totally connected. Instacart just won't fucking let me buy
00:27:23 groceries from it. I'm hungry. Damn it. I want my fucking walnuts. Hashtag let Ben eat.
00:27:31 Walnuts are expensive, dude. Holy shit. They're not as expensive as Brazil nuts,
00:27:37 which I was eating a lot of because they're very low carb. However, they're also very high in
00:27:41 selenium. And if you eat more like two Brazil nuts have your day's supply of selenium. What is
00:27:46 I was eating by the handful. So like hitting like thousands and thousands of my daily value
00:27:51 of selenium, which causes like brittle fingernails and probably death. I don't know.
00:27:57 This fancy steak dinner, dude, that's expensive. It's not as expensive as facial reconstruction
00:28:02 surgery. That's not that expensive. I don't know. For nuts, they're fine. I love and I just love nuts.
00:28:10 You know, I don't want to try especially ligmen nuts. Get it? What? I said, I love nuts, especially
00:28:16 ligma. What's Bofa? What's up dog, Ben? What is up dog? As the PCP turns into people clamoring to
00:28:30 be the next person to be post noun. Here's the newest post now that I'm going to introduce. I am
00:28:36 post groceries, because I have no need for groceries, because my entire life is now revolving
00:28:42 around Hello Fresh, which I have become a devote follower of. I don't tell me about it.
00:28:48 No, that's what I'm going to come right out and say before you. That's stupid. That's
00:28:51 fucking stupid. Why is that stupid? Why is that stupid? Okay, Hello Fresh, it's like buying groceries,
00:28:57 but they only deliver you as much as you need for exactly one meal at a time and they cost 10
00:29:03 times as much. That's Hello Fresh. Okay, they do not cost 10 times as much. And why would I need that
00:29:08 over flow? Why would I want more? I don't know. You fucking buy and bulk to save fucking money. You
00:29:14 don't, oh, they'll send you like, oh, they'll send you like two beef patties and one fucking mango
00:29:19 to make chutney out of. And that's what you get for like an entire day's worth of food with Hello
00:29:23 Fresh. Bullshit. That's all you need to make the meal that they have made. Yeah, you're one meal for
00:29:29 one day, which you get like three times a week. So you can eat three times a week on Hello Fresh.
00:29:34 You know, I, and it's great. It's a great time. I'm thoroughly enjoying it. My lifestyle has been
00:29:39 crippled by my inability to make time to go get groceries or eat. I want to use some of this
00:29:44 technology to solve this problem in myself. It may use Instacart. Instacart's really good when it
00:29:48 works. I've been thinking about doing Postmates. I don't know if that works. I don't know. I've
00:29:51 never heard of it, but I do it. Okay. Well, before you go on Nate, the reason I defend Hello
00:29:57 Fresh is small, like sample size. Yeah, tell me about it. It makes it super. Well, do you know
00:30:02 anything about Hello Fresh? You know what it is? Nothing. I want to be educated. Okay. Okay. Hello
00:30:05 Fresh is a service where you can pay like per, I think it's per week and they send you meals every
00:30:11 week and it sends you like recipes that they have made. It's like Hello Fresh official recipes
00:30:16 for these really great dishes and they send you literally everything in the recipe. Are you sponsored
00:30:21 by Hello Fresh? If not, why not? They send you the exact ingredients you need in the exact amounts
00:30:28 you need for a specific recipe for a dinner for like two or whatever. Yes. And it's great because
00:30:35 then you have the exact amount of things that you need. So cooking is super easy. And this
00:30:39 sounds good. This is like my gateway into cooking things is because that's what I want. I want
00:30:44 that so bad. I'm sick of being a failure. Okay, Nate, check out this shit. It is designed so that
00:30:50 every meal like like every single thing is 30 minutes to 40 minutes to make all total like like
00:30:56 Oh my god, 30 minutes? And at these low low prices? I can't afford not to. They're delicious.
00:31:04 Everything I've made has been fucking the cream to cream. It's been fantastic. I've been
00:31:10 doing everything. And not only am I getting to be able to cook, I mean, I'm taking off the train
00:31:14 wheels. I'm ready to cook things that aren't on recipe. I've been holding my skills to like do
00:31:18 things at once. I'm connecting with my mom. I do it with my mom. It's family bonding. All your
00:31:23 problems. Yeah, nothing is nothing is nothing in this world is less post food than what the
00:31:31 fuck. I don't even remember. What are we talking about? Hello fresh? Hello fresh is the least
00:31:34 post food thing ever. Why would I want to be? I am anti post food. I am anti post food. I'm
00:31:40 just coming out right here and saying no, listen, stupid. You'd buy just buy buy the
00:31:45 fucking bear is sent by the fucking basic building blocks of food and eat them in the amounts that
00:31:50 you need to survive. And don't even worry about anything else. Oh, great. I can put some I'll
00:31:55 have some fucking I'll braise these red onions to put on my on my my stupid, you know, a black
00:32:03 Angus, you know, bird patty with some some some some smoke out because when you want to eat foods,
00:32:10 you want to taste the food that you put the work. No, you want to taste the food. Literally,
00:32:15 who fucking cares? Everyone put the post food group cares about what they're putting in their
00:32:20 body. And this is the only reason the food is a cultural institution. The only reason it's
00:32:27 so that you can trick idiots into thinking you have a skill by putting it together like oh,
00:32:31 I looked at this recipe on Google and now it tastes really great. You can't do it. You couldn't
00:32:37 do it. So whether that's important, you know, I think I looked up exactly how to put this onion
00:32:44 on top of this cheese on top of this lettuce. So I have the perfect burger five minutes later.
00:32:48 It's destroyed and it's worthless. It's a totally ephemeral, pointless experience that adds nothing
00:32:53 of value to the world. Your life is full. Life is full of the value is cooking it in it of itself.
00:32:58 That is an inherent skill and waste my fucking time with someone else. Then the point of the meal
00:33:05 is not only arranging, arranging bits and pieces, arranging bits and pieces into a cultural
00:33:11 institution of unethically optimal. We've made all these different recipes now, these different
00:33:16 flavors. We've honed the craft of eating. This is part of our civilization. It's part of society.
00:33:22 We've evolved the business way. We've perfected this part of our biology. You don't even know
00:33:27 shit. No, no. Oh my god, shut up. It's a cultural and tribal endeavor. You are stuck in the past,
00:33:34 Munchie. You're a hardcore conservative. I am a liberal hero post food and we all need to evolve
00:33:40 past these pathetic, weak human desires for things that taste good and just get down with the...
00:33:46 Thank you. Thank you. I can rest easy knowing that the millenials, the simple, the simpleton
00:33:54 millenials are not in your favor and there are the HelloFresh subscriptions every single day.
00:33:59 I can rest easy. Me, CEO of HelloFresh, Munchie J.Fresh. You don't have Digi or Gib to defend your
00:34:06 weak team here. You're up against the full post food boys here at the spot. I want to say, I want
00:34:11 to say, I think that HelloFresh embodies the absolute worst attitudes of the 30-year-old boomer
00:34:20 and the intellectually laziest, least good segment of the millennial population.
00:34:29 The people that are getting HelloFresh, these are cowards who are, they are like, they are working
00:34:35 their nine to five selling beads on Etsy and thinking that that makes them artists. These are
00:34:42 people... Dirty poor, they're doing dirty poor. They're just mixing some paints together into a cup
00:34:48 and it's pouring onto a can. No, these are white picket fence motherfuckers. These are white picket
00:34:56 fence, you know, married with two and a half children, pieces of shit that are getting HelloFresh
00:35:02 and Munchie, I think you need to stop this. Okay, okay, like everything that you just said is
00:35:08 retarded. If you're coming home from work, then it's like, oh, I'm not going to do anything with
00:35:13 my, I'm just going to watch TV. But with this, you're cooking something, you're learning a skill,
00:35:18 you can do it with your family. And okay, okay, I literally, like for the first like five meals
00:35:23 in HelloFresh, here's what I did. I got downstairs, I was with my mom, and for the entire family,
00:35:27 we cooked a beautiful, delicious meal. Together, we were talking the entire time I was working with
00:35:33 my mom. I don't talk to my mom like outside of this. I was using that time to not only connect
00:35:37 with my mom, make a delicious dish for the entire family to enjoy. And then we all sat down and ate
00:35:41 dinner together. You could have been playing video games. You could have been playing video games.
00:35:47 Well, yeah. It sounds like the act of preparing a meal could be replaced with anything else.
00:35:53 I mean, but why would you want to be? Because you also get to eat at the end.
00:35:57 Yeah, but it's not, yeah, but it's delicious meal at the end, which is the biggest bonus of all.
00:36:01 Okay, I know that this is like a me problem that doesn't apply to most people, but you have no fine
00:36:06 con- with HelloFresh or something like that, you have no fine control over what ingredients go into
00:36:10 your food. You don't have control over what kind of- I think that's why people like it though.
00:36:13 What kind of macro nutrient profile you're eating. With me, with my, I can just fucking,
00:36:18 I'll just like drink like a quarter, I'll just drink like a quart of heavy cream or a pint of
00:36:22 heavy cream, and I'll eat like a piece of sausage for dinner. This HelloFresh even drop off
00:36:26 quarts and heavy cream. And celery and peanut butter for dessert, and I get the exact nutrients
00:36:30 that I want, and it's up to me, and I don't give a shit. Oh, okay, okay. Well, we'll say this. I
00:36:35 will say that HelloFresh is definitely like a training wheel situation. Yes, that's what I was
00:36:39 going to say. There's a long term, like I'm always going to be using HelloFresh for the rest of my
00:36:43 life. That's what I was going to say, Ben, that I feel like this could be a stepping stone for me to
00:36:47 possibly learn how to not be such a complete terrible human being when it comes to handling my
00:36:52 food situation. But it's definitely a way to open your eyes and be able to realize, oh, cooking
00:36:56 isn't that hard, you know, like the cleanup isn't that bad. It's really not a problem for me to
00:37:00 be able to cook every day. Like Tom, Tom, I know I am a post food boy. I want to be post food. Yeah,
00:37:04 how can you be post food and this at the same time? I'll tell you how. Because Nate's on the
00:37:09 edge, and he realized the errors of his way, so he just wants to see me. No, I haven't realized the
00:37:12 errors of the ways, but the thing is I have human flaws, and I sometimes crave food. We're not going
00:37:18 to get stuck if you just curb your entire brain power. This is how my life goes. This is how my
00:37:27 life goes day to day. That's what I'm getting right now. Okay, sure. I wake up in the morning.
00:37:32 I'll get a heel, and I'll do that. And then like it's later in the day. And then I'm like, well,
00:37:37 I've got no groceries around because I'm a lazy piece of shit who doesn't like plan ahead with
00:37:41 this stuff. What am I going to do? I'll tell you what I do. I fire up Grubhub or I fire up what's
00:37:46 it called? I get some fucking Chinese food. I know it is bad, and I want to stop it. Go back to the
00:37:52 fridge, you get another heel, and you realize that you've conquered your human weakness. I want to
00:37:57 do that, but I just like my hunger overrides my desire for fuel. Nate, try not to eat. Hold
00:38:04 down your finger on the Grubhub app, drag it to the trash, and never make this mistake again.
00:38:09 You can't. You just want to just know. Just know that you can not eat, and it will not harm you.
00:38:15 Intermittent fasting. Go OMAD, all right? You get your fuel, and then that's your one meal a day,
00:38:21 and you're done. You've completely destroyed your human weakness. Okay, maybe I should get into some
00:38:27 of this stuff and actually try it out and see if I can. Nate, when your beautiful son, top of the
00:38:34 class, comes up to you every night, and he's like, Father, Father, I'm hungry, and I'm sorry if you
00:38:39 haven't fed me in three days. Are you going to give him a drink of fuel? Are you going to pour some
00:38:43 fuel into his head and say, Here, drink this. No, you're going to give him a dinner. You're going to
00:38:47 give him a dinner, Nate. The only thing that's passing through your lip is the words of the Lord.
00:38:52 Now, hook up your fucking IV drip of fuel, and feed yourself your fucking weak post-food child.
00:38:59 That's what I'm going to say. I'll give him his daily ration of omega-3 pills and caffeine.
00:39:06 That's right. That's what it's going to be. It's going to be a beautiful future,
00:39:09 Munchie, and your kind will be gone. You'll be long gone. I hope so. I'm ready to die on this hill.
00:39:17 I do mean die. Well, with Ben's plan of just stopping eating, I mean that's... Okay, okay,
00:39:23 I mean it's not permanent plan. Contrary to what you may believe, I actually completely agree with
00:39:28 Ben, and if you choose to stop eating for a week, that's fine. Go ahead. Look, people are like,
00:39:34 oh, you're fashion for three or four days. That's so dangerous. Kyle, come on, dude.
00:39:43 You need to eat. Oh, you're going to... What? I don't know. Do I die? I'm going to...
00:39:47 Ball. Who cares? I don't know. I don't know. I know they had my best interest at heart.
00:39:53 But a lot of people in my discord were like, worried for me, and I did not understand why.
00:39:59 I mean, what's going to happen? What's going to happen? Just consider their life experience,
00:40:04 eating like several times a day every day their entire life, and they've heard about people starving
00:40:09 to death, and you know, I thought of the same source of death. I too have heard about people
00:40:13 starving to death. It's like a virus. If you've heard about someone starving to death, then you
00:40:18 will starve to death. I've heard rumors that if you don't eat, you might die if you go long enough.
00:40:23 I did the fucking research. I looked into it. Has anyone ever tested this theory?
00:40:28 I think not. How long does it take to die if you don't eat? The answer is like a month or more.
00:40:32 I just drive by, you know, like skinny African starving children. I'm just like,
00:40:36 these guys are living the life, man. These guys, they've got it figured out.
00:40:40 They're fucking keto. I bet if they peed on a keto strip, it'd be a dark purple.
00:40:45 Oh my god. Wait, would it be cheater? Which is in our new society. That's how we judge class.
00:40:51 That's how dark your keto is. We've come full circle because purple was the color of royalty,
00:40:57 and now we've come back. That's right. That's right. It's all connected in the great circle of life.
00:41:02 Would it be cheaper to, instead of giving like three meals a day to African children,
00:41:06 we give them fuel supplements. We give fuel to African children. That's kind of the thing.
00:41:10 Fuel supplements that they need. That's one of the like things that like fuel,
00:41:14 and like things like it might salt, possibly, if they could, you know. Do they market it?
00:41:19 It has like so many cute food shortages. Fuel's got to be some like some overpriced
00:41:23 fucking like nutrition sports supplement. Oh, it absolutely is. I mean, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:28 But like the way they're selling it is not like a world hunger solution. No, no, they're selling
00:41:35 us a convenience. The reason they say that is because like for all the fucking soy boys who
00:41:38 want to get on that shit, it makes them feel better about buying it. I guess so. Like you're
00:41:42 not, it's totally marketing bullshit. I don't buy it for a second. I mean, if they could theoretically
00:41:48 get the price really down low and they were able to like get all the you know, theoretically,
00:41:52 but right now they're doing nothing to help that at all. Yeah, like like Soylent was the same promise.
00:41:56 I'm sure we're gonna go to Ethiopia and be like, do you want to pay $60 for two bags of dust? Here
00:42:01 you go. Isn't there some like, isn't there some like rice, some like highly nutritious GMO rice
00:42:06 that is meant as like a world hunger solution? I believe that is a thing that I've heard of.
00:42:10 I've definitely heard something about it from India, I want to say, but I don't remember.
00:42:14 It's never gonna go anywhere though, because it's GMO and we have retarded people.
00:42:20 How dare we help those fucking starving African children. If we allowed GMOs to go
00:42:24 further, then we would probably be in like a utopia right now. Can you imagine like all the
00:42:28 crazy shit people would be able to do and like like weird DNA parts of animals to make foods for
00:42:35 foods and have all the creatures we need. Think of how much closer to Starfleet we'd be if we had
00:42:39 GMOs and stem cells just going full throttle. It'd be good, it'd be good. Yeah, pro stem cells.
00:42:46 The world does suck. So many aborted babies go to waste every year and we need to end this,
00:42:50 we need to end this waste. Yeah, we gotta use them. They've got those delicious little stem cells.
00:42:55 Less babies, more fucking biohacking, that's what I want. Less babies, more rabies, please.
00:43:02 More rabies, please, he says, holding down his hands.
00:43:06 So all right, well man, that was a raucous event, good. I think we all need to cool down after
00:43:12 that. So LaCroix is guilty, right? LaCroix, yeah. We are the judge's jury for the executioner here
00:43:19 on the piece. I've been doing Inktober and it's great. It's an absolutely great hashtag.
00:43:26 Where's day three, Munchy? Where's day three? Oh, I'm doing that right after this. I have the
00:43:30 entire sketch on it. It's like right in front of me, like as we speak. But it's already day seven.
00:43:35 I know it's already day seven, but... Yeah, I skipped it. I skipped it.
00:43:43 You've been posting one every day, but like this one from day three just was so complicated or
00:43:47 something that it was... I don't mean to get... Okay, we'll be up by the time that you hear this,
00:43:52 obviously, viewer. It's not going to be crazy, but I just wanted to do it,
00:43:56 Jessus, because it has somewhat sentimental value to me. Yeah, okay, sure. I can't wait to see sands
00:44:01 and the undertale. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't wait to see the first Munchy porn that you'll ever see.
00:44:05 Oh my god. Oh my god. All right, team now ladies. Get in there. Okay, people who are like,
00:44:12 oh, what Inktober? Don't you mean digitaltober? Haha, hashtag protest, hashtag digital art is just
00:44:19 as good as traditional art. There's like an alternate hashtag that's like, I don't know. I've
00:44:24 seen people use like spook, spooky, there's like, there's like alternate hashtags that don't imply
00:44:30 ink. And yeah, it totally gets away from, from what Inktober is. So, Inktober is supposed to be
00:44:35 specifically an analog. They feel so attacked that people are just like drawing traditionally.
00:44:44 They feel so like under pressure, like someone just in their own home is like making a drawing with
00:44:51 pencils and paper. Don't you know that digital art is real art too? Why are you attacking me like
00:44:57 the violence against their art form really? I think it's just because they want to participate,
00:45:01 but they don't want to like actually pull out pencils and paper. Dude, okay, it doesn't matter.
00:45:05 It's not a matter if it like that digital art isn't real art. It's not about having a diverse set of
00:45:11 scales. I mean, I agree. I do whatever I'm just playing devil's advocate. But no, like if Ink,
00:45:16 because like I was under the impression for a while that Inktober was just, just drawing like
00:45:21 black and white with ink, whether it was digital or not, because so many people I saw was doing it
00:45:25 digitally. But then I found out, no, it's supposed to be pen and ink, because like, that's kind of
00:45:29 badass. Like it makes more sense at that point to be a thing. Maybe the reason they're so upset
00:45:34 about this was because when they were a child, there's no control Z in real life and they can't
00:45:39 function without it anymore. They were a young child. These goddamn Zoomers don't know how to draw
00:45:44 with a pen. Yeah, they're walking home from just an average day of Inktober and, you know, holding
00:45:49 hands with their parents, you know, who had just been doing some digital drawing that day and still
00:45:55 were using the hashtag Inktober. And then that damn... They've been doing some digital drawing in
00:45:58 divorce court. Yes. And then that goddamn hardcore Inktober came out and murdered both their parents
00:46:05 and then they became, you know, Batman. It's like, you know, over their body like, no, they were one
00:46:12 day from divorce. I was one day away from two Christmases. So close. Listen, I'm not saying
00:46:21 that like I enjoy traditional drawing quite the opposite. It's like a huge pain in the ass from
00:46:27 stuff to finish. I feel the same way. But it's important to have those skills. It's important
00:46:32 to be able to work in whatever medium that you're given, because that will improve your art skills
00:46:36 just across the board. I don't even care so much about that. Like, I feel like you should just do
00:46:40 whatever works for you because like at the end of like it's good if you want to like kind of like
00:46:44 jerk yourself off about like I can do all these harder things. But at the end of the day, the
00:46:47 people who are going to consume the art, they don't care how it's made. They care what the actual
00:46:50 result is. You know what I mean? I don't think you need to do to know how to do traditional,
00:46:56 but it can't hurt, right? I just think the conceit of the event is to draw traditionally.
00:47:05 Don't be a fucking faggot and try and intrude on that. Just like if it's supposed to be a
00:47:09 traditional drawing thing, do it. If you want us to say like, I don't even have as much of a big
00:47:15 deal with these alternative hashtags. If you just say I want to draw, do a 30-day drawing
00:47:19 challenge this month, but I don't want to do a tober, and you make something else, that's fine too.
00:47:24 I think I'm gonna do like a challenge soon. I don't know. I really, really want to do like a 30-day
00:47:29 like page a day challenge. Like soon. Yeah, good. So that I yeah, and it's gonna be really hard.
00:47:36 But I'm not going to do it now, because I don't want it. It's not an Inktober thing,
00:47:40 and it's not supposed to be. So yeah, I will. You know what? Speaking of Inktober,
00:47:44 I want to give a shout out to Nexus Mania, who's doing a four-panel comic for Inktober.
00:47:48 It's fucking great so far. It is really good. I like it. It is really good. 10 out of 10, great
00:47:51 shit. I love Nexus Mania's art style. I've only really seen his digi art, but I like how stuff is
00:47:59 put in everything. Hey, I've got. I am games drawing. They did. Oh my god. That I am games was
00:48:04 so good. I've got a rant. You showed me that yesterday. Yeah, I have a specific rant about
00:48:10 Nexus Mania, now that he's come up. Whenever I am games. Nexus Mania, I've got a big problem with
00:48:15 you, and this is what it is. I do. It's that you are so good at art, and yet you waste your time
00:48:22 making fan art for people like me, people like Tom and Digi. Why are you doing? You should be
00:48:29 using this time. Tom's like abort, abort. No, no, no. Not even, not even at all. I think,
00:48:34 I think this is, this is a good strategy. And let me explain why. Because like what are you
00:48:39 drawing? Like Markiplier or like PewDiePie or someone who matters, you know? Agreed. No, Nate,
00:48:44 you fool. That's like trying to stream Fortnite. It's too saturated. You can't break into the
00:48:49 market. You've got to do something with lesser appeal. He's got this four-panel comic that he's
00:48:53 promoting right now that he's doing for Inktober, which is fucking great. But then he did the
00:48:58 I Am Games thing, and that got like a hundred something likes, that's what brings the people
00:49:03 in. But what does that translate to for the man? Like, what does he get out of this at the end of
00:49:06 the day? It's probably like a five to ten percent retention rate, but like everything's a five
00:49:10 percent retention rate. Nate, what it gets him is that we're talking about him right now. Exactly.
00:49:14 It's a good strategy. Oh, he's going to get a ton of shit from this, which he deserves. This is
00:49:17 how it works. Yeah, he's going to get a lot of shit. He's going to get a whole bunch of hate. Oh,
00:49:20 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Straight to his fucking face. Hey, hey, see you in the car. And then I'm
00:49:24 going to bite bite him because he drew my face, and that's all I care about. Look,
00:49:28 he's a really great artist, and I quite like his stuff. Yeah, that's great. Nexus is unbelievably
00:49:32 good. It doesn't make sense to me. And like, I just, I am constantly astounded that he wastes his
00:49:37 time drawing like things of like me and my drugs. Oh, how disgusting. Oh, wait, did he do the one
00:49:47 of you fighting the girl? Yeah, he did that fucking Inktober of me fighting Cynthia, which was
00:49:52 awesome. Yeah, that's him too. Yeah. It's too good, Nexus. I don't deserve it. Hey, what's the name
00:49:57 of your fucking Super? What's the name of your fucking Gastrodon? Oh, Doon Koon. Doon Koon the
00:50:02 Gastrodon. Yeah, Doon Koon. We had a Doon Koon in the Pokemon XD Nuzlocke. He was a Clay doll. I
00:50:08 think he died. Doon Koon is by like the, he is the God of my run. That and a TTOMZ, the Gyarados.
00:50:16 They always are my two Titans, my two avatars. It's great. I always want to say that like even
00:50:21 really talented artists do fan art like Oda did fucking one or Dragon Ball Z fan art back in the
00:50:28 day. It's fun and they enjoy it. And there's nothing wrong with fan art. There's nothing wrong
00:50:36 with fan art as long as you don't have higher aspirations and you're ignoring them to do fan
00:50:40 art. That's exactly right. Yeah, as long as it's not, yeah, like you shouldn't, if you want to do,
00:50:48 fan art should be a subsidy of what you're trying to do to use as a promotion tool and not take
00:50:54 over your life. Like I ideally, I'd like to do one piece of fan art a month just to continue
00:50:59 perpetuating my brand and have it seep out into the greater zeitgeist of the industry. I actually
00:51:04 haven't done fan art in a long time and I probably should because it is like an important thing for
00:51:10 Yeah, it's a good thing for getting seen but also it's just like it's fun to do and also it's
00:51:14 Yeah, I mean I like it. Like all the fan art I've ever done was stuff that I wanted to do and liked
00:51:18 doing it. Exactly. In the vein of it being good for like promotion, I think it's good even in a
00:51:23 really abstract sense in the way that like if you're drawing fan for something then you like the
00:51:28 property that you're doing the fan art of. And if other people like that, they'll probably like
00:51:32 your art as well because there's probably some sort of like- And also it's a good exercise because
00:51:36 you're drawing something you probably haven't drawn before especially if you're knee deep in a
00:51:40 personal project you're doing the same things over and over again. It gets you to do something
00:51:44 different, breaks it up. My real point was just that like if Nexus or anybody like on their spare
00:51:50 time just wants to like relax and do like a drawing that you know if you're really good it's
00:51:54 going to be really good of something just because you like it a lot, of course that's fine. I just
00:51:58 wouldn't want anyone to waste their valuable time on little old me. On you. I agree. That's
00:52:05 literally what I'm saying. The point is less best guy ever fan art, more I am games fan art.
00:52:12 Confirm from Nate himself. Tom, what are you now? Like who's like like if we want to say best guy
00:52:19 ever then we say best guy ever. What do we call you? Worst guy ever. Worst guy ever. Number one result
00:52:26 on Google image. Confirm. Oh, I guess we call you Polystation 2. I guess that's what we call you.
00:52:30 I don't just- Tom Oliver, it's fine. That's just my name. That's yeah. I've taken the Green Rangers
00:52:35 mantle. Someday when I get rich I will buy a show accurate cosplay of the Green Ranger and
00:52:44 go around with it. It'll be fucking sick. You don't have to get a little more jacked first.
00:52:49 Well, that's that's why I'm going to the gym. They pad those out. They pad those suits out,
00:52:52 but yeah. Hey, can I tell a story? Yeah, sure. I do I do have something I want to bring up but
00:52:59 I will do it. It was relevant. This is totally irrelevant. Mine is completely a left turn as
00:53:04 well so go for it. God damn it. Help. Yeah, I don't have much time. I got to get it out.
00:53:12 Okay, so I would have told this on the last PCP but I wasn't on it. So like two weeks ago
00:53:17 I was walking through Harvard Square and I was like waiting what? Harvard Square is cool dude.
00:53:24 Big mistake. Don't go there. Yeah, okay. All right, so I was like headed towards the
00:53:29 I was around like the subway entrance and there was a guy right there was like a bald you know
00:53:35 20-something guy kicking kicking around a soccer ball kind of near the subway entrance and he says
00:53:42 hey as I walk by and I'm like hey all right so and I hear him like talk I think a police officer
00:53:48 walks by and like they chit chat or something like he's like he's talking to people right he's
00:53:54 just saying hi to like everyone and then I go and I do whatever it was I was doing I don't know
00:53:58 and like I walk back that way because I'm going to the train and he's says hi to me again he's
00:54:03 like hi I'm like a quick and I'm like hey and he's like want to play with me and I'm like well
00:54:11 no I got a train to catch and he's like okay uh do you want my card uh do you want to follow me on
00:54:17 Facebook uh and I'm like uh I'll take your card and he's like okay like I got a card I also got
00:54:27 you know like uh I also got a little like like print out here of like my latest uh like blog
00:54:31 entries and I'm like a print out and I'm like and I'm like you know what I'll take that don't
00:54:37 give me the card give me the full one give me like the full pamphlet I want to I want to I want to
00:54:41 read more and he's like okay here you go and I'm like thanks I'll read it on the train so I did
00:54:46 right uh so I don't know I'm just gonna I'm gonna start reading I won't read the whole thing but
00:54:51 let me just I'll just try and pick out what's in ready for this uh is it okay to say like real human
00:54:56 beings names on the show just do what would they rhyme with I mean I mean this is a guy who's looking
00:55:01 to self-promote so I think it's okay I guess I mean you're doing him a favor technically right like
00:55:06 this is okay I'm doing it I'm doing okay I'm doing it don't make fun of the train guy fans of the
00:55:11 PCB don't make fun of the train guys listen listen I'm not even making fun of him I I think he's
00:55:18 complex right okay I think he's value I think that I think that a lot of him I think that there's
00:55:26 a lot to recommend him all right I'm not being ironic I just want to say right off the bat like
00:55:30 this seems like a ridiculous thing to do but him handing you a pamphlet of his paper bloods is now
00:55:35 putting him in front of potentially almost 20,000 people right he's he lucked out he lucked out with
00:55:41 me that's um all right the saga of Jeff continues dot dot dot my recent trip to Mexico Cuba and Canada
00:55:50 my name around my name jeffrey thomas ferrell facebook
00:55:55 www.facebook.com slash jeff ferrell that's farrel dot 9 6 9 9 uh and then there's a bunch of links
00:56:04 to facebook things which I assume have like the same the same information and videos and stuff
00:56:10 part one mexico first I went to mexico mexico city specifically my flight from boston was on
00:56:16 may 11th 2018 there was a layover in dallas I used air b&b for lodging I got a room for about
00:56:24 ten dollars a night in venustiano caranza right near the airport some of the places I frequented
00:56:30 were the park on caye oriente 172 and caye oriente 168 mercado moctezuma white and black coffee
00:56:39 and herbal life club nutricional on nte 33 what did I do in mexico well first I concentrated on
00:56:48 learning spanish I taught english for free to various people in mercado moctezuma dude you know
00:56:53 he just walked up to people and said like do you want to learn english friend uh yeah wait yeah
00:57:00 yeah I used to see this guy's not a qualified teacher in any way so he was probably just like
00:57:05 he walks up to someone and says hello and they're like uh like I don't I don't you might that seems
00:57:09 to be his go-to strategy in general I mean listen I don't want to I don't want to input if this is
00:57:15 interesting I'll keep reading but like or should I just should I just like cut out snippets yeah I
00:57:21 guess snippets I don't yeah okay okay um later on I started playing soccer in the local park I
00:57:27 would most of the play teenagers but sometimes I would play with kids and adults they would often
00:57:31 cheer me on and call me quote gringo what they call white people from the US I don't think it's
00:57:36 I don't think it's what they're trying to cheer you on I don't think that's like oh like oh gringo
00:57:39 come over here please please sit down there's a link to a video um I played chess with people in
00:57:45 mexico but I do you watch any of these videos is he like I have not I have not actually looked at
00:57:49 any of this is a printout how's he gonna watch them oh I mean there's links but I haven't followed
00:57:53 them you have to type out the link into fucking yeah all right that's some work I need some QR
00:57:58 codes clearly yeah I played chess with people in mexico but I played soccer more often it was easier
00:58:03 and more convenient to hop into soccer games and try and convince people to play me in chess
00:58:06 I did however play some chess in the airport and with people in some of the stores apparently this
00:58:11 guy like apparently he's tried to like make money by like challenging people to later on in here he
00:58:16 talks about how like he wants to like bet money for for on chess games with people but Americans
00:58:22 or Bostonians specifically just aren't willing to bet more than like a dollar at a time okay uh
00:58:27 oh yeah using blah blah blah blah okay something about Cuba I think this is already on dude can
00:58:32 I can I get a link to one of these you want to read me a link so I can go to the fucking YouTube
00:58:36 like right now this is the show notes well his name is his name is I mean the link okay I'll google it
00:58:41 facebook.com slash jeff.ferrell.9699 okay I'm really interested in this guy but I just want to reiterate
00:58:48 don't don't like fans don't make a mug in in this guy's facebook he doesn't deserve it I mean I mean
00:58:54 I don't see why they would okay he's just talking about his trip to Mexico like I don't there's nothing
00:58:59 we're gonna get silly we might we might poke a little bit fun I want that to translate and then
00:59:05 sort of like yeah nobody the procrastinators podcast is not condone here here this this
00:59:10 this one this part stands out to me well hang on bet it was it facebook.com slash jeff then what yeah
00:59:16 .ferrell.9699 okay all right .9699 toward the end of my stay in Mexico I I moved into a five
00:59:28 dollar a night room in a different house this house was very close to the other house I stayed at
00:59:33 unlike the first location I was allowed to invite guests to my room at will here I brought Mexican
00:59:39 women back to my room and played them in chess haha is that a euphemism perhaps he
00:59:48 he I like to imagine that that he like actually did do that and and he was like he was like I mean
00:59:53 I pass it off I was only more than it was yeah no I think well here he continues yeah speaking
01:00:00 speaking of women on average the women in Mexico City are more flirtatious than women in Boston
01:00:05 I suspect it is because gringos are highly sought after there don't get me wrong a lot of women
01:00:11 don't get me wrong a lot of women I hung out with were just friends the thing was I was clearly
01:00:17 getting much more attention in Mexico City than Boston now here I am sitting in both in the Boston
01:00:22 area 26 and single haha haha I like that that's a right that that's a real right my friend I like
01:00:31 I like that part a lot um I was in Mexico City I'm skipping ahead a little bit uh one culture
01:00:39 difference is smoking is more popular here than in Boston for example no one in my family smokes
01:00:44 I was in Mexico City for about three months and I learned the bulk of my Spanish there
01:00:47 by the end of my stay I could say much more than keres hugar ad adres conmigo which I'm pretty
01:00:54 sure means do you want to play chess with me um he he lot he says that he lost weight quickly in
01:00:59 Mexico even though he was eating the same amount I bought a few shirts in Mexico City like the Mario
01:01:05 shirt and a duff one I also made a ton of friends there to the degree it felt necessary to write
01:01:10 many of my facebook posts in Spanish my facebook page is by this is getting a little tedious what
01:01:14 okay okay sorry sorry all right then he talks about Cuba hey hey do you want to know his favorite

01:04:56 no I'm talking about the guy you met that's jeff fucking jeff yeah oh the train I mean I would
01:05:00 consider him the soccer guy oh he was soccer guy he was I mean yeah he was hanging out near a subway
01:05:05 entrance but he was his most dramatic features are just kicking a soccer ball um that's his character
01:05:10 design he can't see with that he can't see the soccer ball else the silhouette doesn't convey
01:05:16 there is uh there is one I want to leave I want to read the postlude so at the very end he links to
01:05:21 some you know links to um you know he says he's moved he's back in America he's living in his
01:05:26 family's house with like the rest of his family um he says uh a few days after returning to
01:05:32 deadam for the first time in my life I'm noticing some gray hairs which is quite unusual giving my age
01:05:37 26 and heredity it's not that unusual uh the people here also don't appreciate my soccer playing as
01:05:43 much as in other countries some people are quite nice though and they take videos when I request
01:05:46 them my plans I'm looking for quick cash I could get yeah I could get a formal job same brother same
01:05:54 aren't we all I could get a formal job but that takes more time so I'm considering these options
01:05:59 in order of preference one panhandling while juggling my soccer ball in downtown Boston
01:06:05 Chinatown or Harvard I think you thought about me so apparently he went with that one yeah apparently
01:06:09 he went with that one yeah two playing chess for money in Harvard Square the people in Harvard
01:06:14 Square often make very small wagers over games they play five dollars less I I kind of want to go back
01:06:19 because like I think he's got a schedule of times he'll be there go back dude I might go back or like
01:06:24 maybe challenge him to a chess game like literally do it literally do it wait yeah is there any
01:06:29 reason why we can't go to Boston when we're in person get him and take him back to your apartment
01:06:34 to record rfck is there any reason why we can't do that I mean he'd have to consent to it that's
01:06:39 that's the only hurdle I can see a hurdle right there but you know we have ways of getting around
01:06:42 that Jeff I know you're listening to this let's make this my people talk to your people Jeff we'll
01:06:47 get this going and then and then three freelance programming work on craigslist or a similar site
01:06:54 I've done this a couple times but the gigs are hard to come by program for uh yeah he apparently he
01:06:58 saved up money for travel by working a programming job and he mentioned this earlier in the thing but
01:07:03 I skipped it and therefore teaching Spanish the problem with this is that my Spanish is quite
01:07:08 bad compared to native speakers why I feel damn this this cursive fate why why couldn't I just speak
01:07:14 fluent Spanish and I feel uncomfortable teaching something I'm bad at well imagine that unlike
01:07:21 other people and you did school teachers stop you yeah all right so that's Jeff so that's Jeff
01:07:28 Pharrell uh an oddball vagrant that I met in a legend Jeff I mean this unironically he sounds
01:07:35 fascinating I wanted yeah yeah okay yeah and they're on the Grayson no it just imagine it just
01:07:41 and that starts us out at like a train station yeah well I mean it takes all like imagine just
01:07:46 like flying to Mexico and like hanging out in the fucking like town square kicking like juggling
01:07:52 a soccer ball like meeting like kids and adults and stuff and like playing them and women and luring
01:07:57 them back to your house to play chess with you yeah yeah yeah sounds like you know scold them I mean
01:08:03 I mean the the way that he the way that he was just like hi like at me twice like right yeah like
01:08:10 two times I passed him and both times he was just like hi and the second time he was just like want
01:08:14 to play with me like this I don't know you know okay you know what it's gonna sound like it's gonna
01:08:20 sound like an insult to say that he seems like a little autistic or a little off or something but I
01:08:23 don't mean it in a bad way it seems like this is this is like missing that's what this is he's not
01:08:30 in tune with his inhibitions like normal people would be like scared or worried if you do that in
01:08:34 public this seems like this guy just doesn't give a fuck and he just wants to go out he is a respectable
01:08:39 thing yeah yeah yeah have you guys heard the theory that we're surrounded by NPC characters in our
01:08:46 lives and that a lot of people around us don't have souls because there was a there was a set number
01:08:51 of souls in the universe and you see we just keep expanding the human population and so not everybody
01:08:56 has one you know there's one soul it's the same soul reincarnated across time and every individual
01:09:02 transubstantiation I invented it Nate give me I have somewhat related to this I've I've
01:09:08 along because like there's always that that uh that theory that like we're in a simulation
01:09:14 and all that shit yeah yeah right and so like even before I heard about this like NPC thing I always
01:09:20 wondered about the simulation because there are many times that I'll just be out and about and I
01:09:24 will notice like people just randomly walking around that seem to have almost identical faces to
01:09:29 people I've seen before and it feels like the random character generator is like starting to loop
01:09:34 it's like terrifying yeah so often I will see someone and think okay I said this to a friend
01:09:40 the other day and they laughed at me because in a way it's obvious I said lots of people look like a
01:09:44 combination of two other people which was sure was dumb because everyone has two parents that
01:09:50 they're a combination of but that's not what I mean fair enough I mean that all the time I'll see
01:09:54 someone was like oh that looks like you know you know my friend my friend Tom and my friend John
01:10:00 that looks like a combination of you know if anyone looks happy and and so and so or something or
01:10:04 that looks like well my instincts tell me about that which is probably true is that we kind of
01:10:09 pick out features that are recognizable and the people that we know in our lives I'm sure it's
01:10:13 it's like that I mean because like we're humans are great at patterns so I'm sure yeah we just
01:10:18 ascribe that to it but it just it feels weird to just be out and about and being seeing like someone
01:10:22 who's clearly not that person that looks almost identical but like here they are in a completely
01:10:28 different scenario and situation and it's just like oh god oh god I'm starting to see NPCs repeat
01:10:34 themselves this is this is pretty fucked up and it's terrifying ever since I saw the Truman show
01:10:41 I've always been afraid that like I'm in the Truman show but like a virtual reality version
01:10:46 that's way more like intense and like sure yeah yeah and it's just like made me and like it's like
01:10:52 oh god everything's a lie and and ever since I saw that movie it's always in the back of my mind
01:10:58 and uh it's not even that I think like I'm that important it's just like a terrifying thing to
01:11:03 me to think like this whole thing's a joke and everyone's watching me all the time okay I'm about
01:11:08 to speak in really cynical like vocabulary but I do not mean it in like a mean sort of way
01:11:15 whenever I see those sort of people like like like soccer guy I always think like I realized too late
01:11:21 that it would be fun to not like mess with him but I would describe as like mine him to be able to
01:11:26 like talk to him and like exhaust his dialogue options yeah yeah yeah yeah like like like like
01:11:34 like a quest person and I want to I realized too late that I what I should be doing instead of just
01:11:39 saying like oh like no like no things just you know and walking away or instead of just like you know
01:11:43 like someone looks like it means like hey I have a dollar I'm like uh yeah okay and then what's the
01:11:47 what is it I should talk to him what's that what's that alt rfc k it's the pissy baby something
01:11:52 fucker fappers right I feel like that's the pissy baby route just be like yeah no I gotta go
01:11:56 I can't stay as opposed to the rowdy fucker who'd get in there dude and make a best friend
01:12:01 yeah it's like it's like a pissy baby fapper fuckers there's also the adult baby diaper lover yeah
01:12:06 hey does my mic sound weird because my my computer just made a weird noise at me and now I'm
01:12:10 worried you sound fine to me right I sound fine yeah okay then yeah it's okay yeah it looks it looks
01:12:15 alright okay it's not only a matter of me like not wanting to it's just a matter of like oh wait
01:12:20 fuck that was one of the people that I can do that too it's like you can't do that to just like
01:12:24 everyone it's not like when if you someone says hi to you it's gonna be a normal person like
01:12:29 if someone's got a guitar and they're asking for money they might have a story they might just be
01:12:32 like a cynical you know just like oh you're trying to make a quick buck you know by lying to people
01:12:36 or whatever but I think I think there's a very good chance that people like that like street
01:12:40 performers are like fucked up weirdos not in a bad way clearly just they're just fucked up weirdos
01:12:47 and it would be fun to talk to them and I just it's a real issue like if you see somebody like
01:12:52 that they clearly have a story yeah and there's so many opportunities that you're passing up
01:12:56 by not investing this guy's definitely got a story it's like it's like a massive like what what
01:13:00 compelled him what compelled him to travel to Mexico Cuba and I forget what the third one is and
01:13:06 juggle his soccer ball in a public square it's it's what compels him to do it even now what what's
01:13:11 his deal like how did you get from like a normal human upbringing to this it's it's it's it's just
01:13:17 you know you know exactly we're the ones all stuck in the box and he's the one thinking outside
01:13:22 I would agree it completely that's why I was like no fuck don't give me your card give me your full
01:13:26 fucking printout yeah yeah I want the full story he's clearly much more free than we are yeah I mean
01:13:31 that's true well for a while it seems like he's run out of money and now he's moved back home
01:13:38 another plane but he's his spirit is still free he can always get another program a job somewhere
01:13:43 I'm sure yeah right yeah well what a fascinating experience to hand out your blog entries printed
01:13:49 out in public like this is going to return on investment you know doing that if he gets on
01:13:55 that's what I wonder I wonder if he thinks I like I wonder if this has any like monetary return for
01:14:00 him or if he thinks it's going to or if it's just a social show well yeah yeah he's gonna make bank
01:14:06 off of that yeah it's good it's gonna be it's gonna get that sick we're gonna pay him an exposure
01:14:10 and then he's gonna get tons of fun not to draw a particularly unfavorable comparison on purpose
01:14:14 but like this does sound fairly similar to the like need gf sign that chris chan would hold up and
01:14:20 kind of you know well only only vagus sessions no but well I wouldn't say it's malicious it's just
01:14:26 creepy like that I'm not even trying to say he's creepy I just mean it well well chris was being
01:14:30 creepy holding up a sign that's like come and talk to me if you want to be my girlfriend like I
01:14:35 don't know it's so creepy though I think it's not gonna work obviously uh yeah I think it's just
01:14:40 such a social it's not malicious it's not bad it's not evil but yeah it's it's icky and it's like
01:14:45 what what I mean what are you doing yeah that that's fair this guy I just I don't know I don't
01:14:50 know what the end goal is here I wonder I wonder if it's just like it's like just very raw and
01:14:54 honest it's just like I want to share this stuff that's why I put it on Facebook and now I'm bringing
01:14:59 it out into like the real world you know I'm sharing my Facebook post in the meat yeah I have a I have
01:15:04 a crazy crazy theory maybe he just wants to make friends because friends are good I'm staying
01:15:11 in valuable and increase the worth of your life maybe that's why I thought of the question can you
01:15:17 imagine because someone like chan would want friends but no cuz because yeah we have a sign
01:15:25 like advertising himself like for friendship you know with a girl but still same no me it's not
01:15:30 the same at all totally different totally different alright this is what this is literally
01:15:35 out of no no no no no no no no no he's out he's out no he's out he's not the same as
01:15:40 fucking with a girlfriend this is why it's different I don't get it this is why it's
01:15:44 It's different because with Chris Chan. He's saying he's like imposing like you become my girlfriend
01:15:50 What what this guy's doing? He's just putting himself out there. Yeah letting you come to him. It's totally different
01:15:56 But but he's just doing that too. He's letting you come to him
01:15:58 No, because because Christian is starting with an ass. He's saying like be my girlfriend
01:16:04 Yeah, I was saying like be my friend. He's just saying hey, I would say that I want to play soccer
01:16:10 I would say that the implication of Chris's sign is that anything less than a romantic connection is
01:16:17 Unwanted and unwelcome sure okay, but like this guy. I'm sure this guy
01:16:21 I'm sure if this guy got a girlfriend from doing what he's doing. That would be fine
01:16:25 I'm sure if he had sex with a lady. Yeah, or whatever wink or better yet
01:16:30 Play chess that would that would be fine. Yeah, or playing chess in his hotel room
01:16:35 This guy is like just looking for any kind of interaction. It's sort of as little as like taking a piece of paper to like maybe
01:16:41 I'm being on a podcast. Maybe it's just maybe there's no business goal here
01:16:45 Maybe it's just as simple as go out there, you know panhandling because he says panhandling in the thing
01:16:51 Yeah, go out there, you know have a hat like if people want to give you money to juggle
01:16:55 So it's the soccer ball meet people and be social and you know reap the benefits that come with that
01:17:03 Generally seems totally fine. Whatever they may be. I want to move this from joke to reality
01:17:09 Literally, can we like if we see him in a harper's grave cuz I'm sure we would go there anyway regardless
01:17:14 Let's really get him in our an RFC camp. So there's no reason not to let's I really
01:17:20 Really doubt that he's gonna be down to come
01:17:24 Like hey do you like me on a blog? Do you want to be on a let's play with us? I
01:17:29 Don't think that would I think I think he's the kind of guy that would go for that
01:17:33 I guess I guess we could ask
01:17:36 Let's ask I don't see it. I don't see it working say is yes, and then murder you
01:17:41 Cuz he's probably got plans
01:17:44 He's got big plans. Okay. I think he's the type of person who would have a free calendar and be down to not only just come on
01:17:51 This let's play for fun, but also to like push his
01:17:58 He says he needs a permit
01:17:59 I think that he's got a permit and he's probably got a plan
01:18:02 He's gonna be there from such-and-such time to such-and-such time
01:18:08 When he's free, I don't know maybe maybe I think we should ask I think we should definitely ask him can't hurt
01:18:14 This might be the adult baby diaper that we don't I don't see it working out
01:18:19 I don't see it working out. I'd be surprised if we can
01:18:23 If nothing else you should just do something for rowdy fuckers on the spot right there
01:18:30 I
01:18:31 Seems to like he seems to like strangers taking videos of him. I mean there you go
01:18:36 We could just record ourselves playing. Oh, they will be a let's play of soccer. We can just we need to stop
01:18:40 Let's play. Oh, let's just let's play time to talk, you know
01:18:44 Yeah, all right. All right guys the only way this will fail if he sees not there
01:18:47 We will get some sort of RBCK content if he's there even if it's just us record
01:18:51 Yeah, I think he's got a schedule
01:18:56 Maybe or you can just message him on Facebook. That's true. We have this contact. Oh god. We could do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
01:19:04 What's his Facebook? I've got a link. I'll post it later. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've got you
01:19:12 So that's so that's Jeff that's Jeff the soccer guy. Yeah, what what a what a legend
01:19:17 What what a what a what a sick dude coming soon to a podcast near you. I sure hope so
01:19:23 I wait with baited breath. That would be pretty that'd be pretty neat. That would be pretty fucking neat. Well team
01:19:29 What do you say? We just transition to questions now? I feel like we've really done a bunch of good shit here and
01:19:34 I don't know high note. Yeah. Yeah
01:19:38 That's a good idea. All right. All right sick. Let me uh
01:19:41 He's not up there at the pantheon of the likes of like Colt Corona and
01:19:45 I don't know. He's a great PCP character. That's right. He's going to be the wrong one real quick. If he's on the RFCK
01:19:50 He's going to be in the next round
01:19:54 I mean, can we give him a soccer ball or something? Maybe. Yeah. All right. All right. Soccer guy soccer guy's soccer outfit
01:20:01 I don't know or what is it? It's uh, so everybody voice mails. Here we go
01:20:06 Oh, I didn't ask for questions in the in the lounge. I'll do that right now. Oh, yeah, I do it
01:20:11 You know what we're skipping Twitter this week. Fuck you people pity questions are dead
01:20:16 No, okay. Yeah, we have a boy have a better way. Yeah, you know what?
01:20:20 I am out of pity this week just because I forgot so sorry everybody
01:20:23 But I didn't tell you that there'd be any questions. So you haven't lost anything. All right. There you go
01:20:27 I feel like I feel like audio questions carry us like pretty far
01:20:31 We've got quite a few things that say like just literally stop doing the text questions and we could definitely possibly
01:20:39 Yeah, I mean, I've been thinking that maybe they're just like this is just a better way. Yeah, let's just
01:20:46 Let's just cancel it. Let's cancel text questions. Why don't you go cancel that?
01:20:52 Okay, okay, I'm literally going to say actually never mind literally. I'm typing it to canceled
01:20:59 All right, I'm sure I'm doing it hang on where can our viewers go to ask us an audio question
01:21:04 They can go to speak pipe comm slash
01:21:08 PCP voicemail, right? Correct. Yeah, that's the one. That's where you go people
01:21:13 All right
01:21:15 Shit everyone's freaking out now that we're never doing again
01:21:18 Who cares if they got a question they can ask it in speak pipe
01:21:22 Okay, here I go. All right. Here we go first question
01:21:25 We got to check in of course with with one spar on his continuing quest to do something very true
01:21:31 Yeah, I feel like I'm out of out of touch with the saga. Yeah
01:21:37 He was like he was arrested by the police last episode. I think because he was trying to get in starbucks time stamps
01:21:43 Oh, yeah, that's right. He was kicked out of Starbucks as he was using the public Wi-Fi
01:21:47 The whole quest is one spot to get all the time stamps if every time we've mentioned Starfleet
01:21:53 Yeah on this podcast which one spot that yeah, we have we haven't we did have a reference to Starfleet in this episode
01:22:00 That's rich did offhand. I don't know if that counts. So that's what uh, so
01:22:05 That last week he got a he got arrested at Starbucks before he was at an insane asylum
01:22:09 Yeah, he's just he's like bleeding out the eyes and they took him to a regular hospital and that's how he escaped
01:22:15 He just needs those time stamps man. This is very we don't know why he needs them yet
01:22:19 It is no no the mystery about that. All right. Let's let's let's go to the let's go to the thing
01:22:24 All right, let's see what you got once bar late late honest friend
01:22:31 Those guys who were cops they had some red shirts on I broke my legs and they threw me woods
01:22:38 But that's not the worst part. That's like the document. There's like there's like almost no time stamps
01:22:44 Oh, man, I'm really discouraged right now
01:22:46 In fact, if I if I got even one piece of constructive criticism no matter how valid it would break my will to live for sure
01:22:53 I
01:22:55 The PCP I'm gonna play real quick. Okay one spot the number of Google search results is not a data point
01:23:03 I
01:23:20 Putting actual effort into his question that's a one-spot one-spot weekly set the bar too high for any of the rest of you
01:23:26 Please help this man with his time stamp shit
01:23:29 Where's like post in the comments one spar like where they can?
01:23:32 I don't know where this document is with the updates. I assume it's on somewhere
01:23:36 I guess we could put it in the show notes. Yeah, we maybe we should
01:23:41 Yeah, all right. Well anyway, let's move along here. We've got another one here from
01:23:46 Tomaso Choco Choco another favorite Ohio Ohio to you Choco. Let's let's see what you have to say years ago
01:23:54 I was at a slumber party
01:23:56 My friend said hey, we got cinematics. Let's stay up late and watch porn
01:24:00 I said, all right, so we stayed up late and we started watching the porn now
01:24:05 I was the channel god. I hope this isn't going because I think it's second and work half the time
01:24:10 So while I was sitting there
01:24:11 I heard my friends like arguing for a bit and then it got weirdly quiet
01:24:16 So I was like, all right, what the fuck's going on?
01:24:18 So I turn around and my friend's mouth is an inch away from my other friend's dick
01:24:23 And as soon as his lips touch that dick come just shoots into his mouth and you start screaming and
01:24:31 Crying and everything we're trying to get him to shut the fuck up
01:24:35 but through the commotion we got caught and
01:24:39 he had to swallow the cum because
01:24:43 Because his dad is a pastor. Can you imagine a worse thing to see what was in his mouth? Oh
01:24:50 What was the gayest thing you've ever experienced?
01:24:54 This voicemail
01:24:59 I've never uh-huh
01:25:01 Experienced anything anywhere close to that gay, you know not not and I never will knock on wood
01:25:07 Yeah, let's let's pray for that
01:25:09 I mean there is that story that I've told before about how me and my buddy John college roommates
01:25:14 You're just both lying in bed, you know across from each other. Yeah. Yeah, look
01:25:19 I know it's that look we're in two separate beds across the room
01:25:24 What was it?
01:25:25 John just says to me hey like it like we're both, you know tucked in ready to go to sleep
01:25:29 He's just like hey, dude my dick's out right now. He had like under the blankets
01:25:33 He had taken out his dick and I just say oh you do it. I'm gonna do it, too
01:25:37 I yelled to him across the room and he's like no don't do it. We'll be gay and by the time
01:25:41 I got mine out luckily his was was tucked away safely so we weren't
01:25:45 Narrowly avoided being gay a happy ending
01:25:52 Anybody else
01:25:56 I don't think I've ever been gay
01:25:59 Everyone thought I was gay, but I didn't actually I mean I mean I mean I was gay in the sense that I was a faggot
01:26:05 But I don't know if I was gay
01:26:07 Yeah, I guess I guess I guess the only kind of gay thing I've experienced is what I was telling Ben when he was over
01:26:14 We were getting Wendy's was that uh that I I'm on tinder. Yeah, and and since since I am bisexual or as I call it part-time gay
01:26:24 I found out you're a you're a you're a fair-weather faggot
01:26:29 Agreed agreed
01:26:31 That one for sure. That's a good one. So so I've just found out that I'm either I think gay guys are just much more desperate
01:26:37 Because I'm much more popular with gay and then with women men in general desperate for sure
01:26:42 Men I mean men are just more. I mean I'm desperate. That's why I'm on tender fair enough
01:26:46 Yeah, like men are just willing to fuck way more easier than I mean men men just men just are men are more proactive men are
01:26:52 Expect men have to initiate the conversation almost all the time. Yeah, it's very sense make sense. Yeah. Well, all right
01:26:57 You're well on your way. Yeah, and I guess that carries over to the gay sphere as well
01:27:03 Let's see. Okay, so here's another message. Oh, yeah, I think the gayest thing I've ever experienced was one time
01:27:10 I was like, I don't even know what I was doing. I was just hanging out behind my my middle school
01:27:13 And someone came up to me and said so like you're gay, right?
01:27:17 You're gay. Just wanted to make sure like you're gay, right? Wait, was this a man saying this? Yeah, this is another man
01:27:22 And I was like no
01:27:29 And then they was like, okay cool, and then he went away I in high school
01:27:34 There was a girl who wanted to date me
01:27:36 Yeah, and I didn't and and we went on a date to the mall and I didn't really like her
01:27:41 She asked if she could kiss me and I said no well and yeah, and I wasn't feeling it and
01:27:47 She tried to she's she you know she utterly devastated me my reputation by spreading the the heinous rumor that I was gay
01:27:57 It didn't stick at all and it meant nothing
01:28:01 You know, I found it mildly amusing that an attempt made was was made
01:28:07 Yeah, I feel I doesn't go anywhere
01:28:09 I almost sort of see why she might think that if she thinks that she's attractive and it doesn't make you know
01:28:16 Yeah, it's like oh he must be gay. Maybe it wasn't delicious really. I don't know
01:28:20 I mean you're spreading a rumor
01:28:22 I mean even if you think even if you think it's well even if you think it's true
01:28:26 If like you're going around being like oh that guy that was a way to protect her ego like she could have just said immediately
01:28:32 When you said no, it's like oh is it I mean nobody had to know nobody had to know that this has maybe I mean
01:28:38 Maybe she told her friends, right? That's all you know. Oh, you know, he's gay
01:28:41 It's he must just be gay or else he would have and then the chatterboxes begin and then
01:28:46 Oh, yeah girl. Oh, he's oh, he's definitely gay. There's no other reason why he would have snubbed you like that. Oh, yeah
01:28:52 Yeah, well, okay. Well, he's fucking gay. Yeah, and he's a denny's a jerk, too
01:28:57 Yes, yes, yeah, also he did try to rape me that was
01:29:01 Well, that was true. That one was true
01:29:05 I guess he thought that it was a guy or something because like yeah, he tried to rape me still so I don't know what's going on there
01:29:12 Excellent. Oh, there was that like I guess this was also pretty gay
01:29:16 There was just that one time that someone comes out. I didn't have gay sex. I forgot about that girl
01:29:20 Well, yeah, Nate that see that girl over there
01:29:22 She wants to date you and I just sit there say okay, and then do nothing. I did nothing
01:29:27 I didn't exactly reject my mind. Did nothing kind of reminds me of the girl in only yesterday
01:29:33 I mean like the girls the girls march up to her in lockstep and they announce like so and so has a crush on you
01:29:39 They run away. She's like
01:29:42 Okay, oh dear
01:29:44 I don't know, you know women. It's like it's different. I guess because there's like different standards for this stuff
01:29:49 I don't know whatever because it's different for girls. Everything's apparently all right
01:29:54 Let's play another one is here's one from ironclad argument. Let's uh
01:29:59 Is this guy's name? So I'm listening to the podcast and I hear did you come out with this like ironclad argument?
01:30:07 Name drop. Why do I have to be smart? What's the benefit?
01:30:13 Right, why do I need to know things you're so smart did you but I don't know where everyone turns his back on them
01:30:19 and starts saying
01:30:23 Cuz it's cuz it's good to be smart
01:30:29 You know, it's a good way to have arguments and truly know things
01:30:33 Not be smart and continue to ask ask why instead of answer the question
01:30:38 Did you what the fuck kind of argument is that? Oh my god? I got a fucking hemorrhoid
01:30:46 Yeah, all right, so so
01:30:49 Did you was arguing as he does that like was this last episode?
01:30:54 Okay, okay, I can't remember why something something we were talking about
01:30:58 Did you was saying you don't need to read books because you can just
01:31:02 The argument against was like books give you more context you can understand the idea is better
01:31:06 Yeah, did you is like if I know what the idea is why do I have to understand it?
01:31:10 Why do I need to be smart? I'm just another one of those stupid things
01:31:13 You just have to push under the rug and be like I guess I could still be his friend
01:31:16 I guess so great if it's so great to not be smart if being smart is so bad then why then
01:31:24 Mr. Ironclad did you say that the idea that you should be smart is dumb
01:31:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought that was sarcasm. I thought he was
01:31:40 Yeah, yeah, okay, so I'm his master plan right
01:31:44 I'll be smart enough to follow that but yes, I'll explain it for you
01:31:48 Here's one
01:31:51 Digi's Digi's an idiot. There we go
01:31:54 The comments from the last episode as they appear currently and in my present may not be for your present viewer
01:32:00 But they're basically all just WTF the PCP is good now question mark and also did you what the fuck are you talking about?
01:32:08 To comments that we get. Oh, yeah
01:32:11 You know what you know, it's great. You know, it's great about the setup like cuz we we the episodes go up on Fridays, right?
01:32:17 Yeah, that's right. That's right
01:32:18 That means that like people will listen to it on Friday then right after that they can go to the
01:32:23 Whatever I forget the site, but the one where you send your email or your audio mail
01:32:28 Yeah, yeah, like you can send it like right after you listen and then we record the next episode like a day after that
01:32:32 Yeah, yeah, right
01:32:35 Yeah, yeah, it's almost like that was intended so we could get back shortly before we record I see I see well
01:32:41 I'm sure that no one I know
01:32:46 Here's another message from our good friend at DeVry University
01:32:51 What do you got no you hit this is please discuss the fetishization of autism. Oh
01:33:00 Oh
01:33:02 Yeah, that's it
01:33:03 That's the whole time. I want to say shout out shout out to shout out to John Boyce on YouTube
01:33:08 He's got a video about the history of the highest scoring basketball game ever I think
01:33:15 And it features one of the teams involved was the DeVry University basketball team
01:33:21 Which almost doesn't really exist but sort of but does just enough does that they technically did take part in
01:33:28 Technically the highest scoring basketball game of all time does DeVry University even still exist at all
01:33:33 I think so I believe it does. Yeah, and it and some of its campuses might even have a basketball team
01:33:40 I don't know what DeVry University is. Is this like a 1980s?
01:33:43 No, they're a no it was like one of those for-profit colleges and they advertise on TV
01:33:52 If you want to be like you guys you want to design video games come to DeVry University, you know one of those guys
01:33:57 Yeah, yeah, I think the reason I don't think they exist anymore is I just don't watch TV
01:34:01 So I haven't seen an ad for DeVry in literally years. Yeah
01:34:05 See then to watch TV after like obviously not and be on the air and being able to have ad block on and just
01:34:11 Yeah, whatever you want. It is cancer. It's like strapping. It's like strapping
01:34:16 you know how the thing in
01:34:19 In the Fantastic Four of Fantastic Four fame he is the thing where he's made of rocks
01:34:23 But there's also an effect where like because he's being turned to stone
01:34:26 It has an effect on his mind and it's hard for him to think and it like slows down his thoughts admit
01:34:31 Which is kind of fucked up and like watching TV has that effect on me
01:34:34 Like my brain morphs and becomes solid and can't like it smooths out the wrinkles you guys all those wrinkles
01:34:40 Smooth write the fuck out. What a shame. Yeah, that's what it does
01:34:44 I mean, I haven't turned on a television just to watch like broadcast or net or cable television and yeah
01:34:50 I can't even remember. I don't I don't even remember
01:34:54 My mom's watching TV so
01:34:57 It'll be interesting to see what like it's like for like our kids when they're like like what are they gonna grow up?
01:35:02 Consuming media with will they be on YouTube? Will they be on Netflix? They'll be on Twitch watching their favorite
01:35:13 They'll be watching their dad stream
01:35:16 Dragon Warrior monsters yeah tonight on twitch.tv slash st. Comics with an X
01:35:24 Well to answer the question the fetishization of autism is that like when you've got like a really dumb anime girl with like really big tits
01:35:32 Is that I think what he means is the idea that autism is now seen as like as like a
01:35:39 pseudo good thing or potentially a good thing or like like
01:35:45 That gives people superpowers in certain contexts. You know who's into this. You know who's way into that did you?
01:35:53 I thought he was referring specifically to digi and I think did you said that he talked about it on like a pub crawl or something
01:35:58 I'm kind of glad the digi's not here because I don't want to hear his answer to this question
01:36:04 Fuck that I mean, I don't know like I think digi is not wrong that like it could be like it's useful
01:36:16 Like did you just uses the autism as a synonym for new types from Gundam so anytime you hear autism just
01:36:25 Have very few similarities between
01:36:34 Autism have their strengths, you know, they have things that they're hyper focused on and drives them to to you know to great knowledge
01:36:46 Okay, not to be I'm not trying to get overly
01:36:48 Critical whatever like I feel like if you asked like the mother of an autistic child like hey
01:36:53 What do you think about like your kid having autism? I don't think they'd be so positive. I don't think you like no
01:36:59 I think it would depend. I mean
01:37:01 Yeah, well here's the thing dude
01:37:04 Millennials can have kids now and millennials like if you're like a super progressive leftist millennial
01:37:08 You bet that they're not gonna say anything bad about it
01:37:11 Okay, that's somewhat of a warp perception because I think even baby boomers would be like my son
01:37:18 What what do you like autism isn't that bad my son my son can do anything that another another boy can do
01:37:23 Yeah, you know, he's not he's he's just you know, he's a little different. He learns a little differently
01:37:27 You know, he's very smart. They do believe that I'm sure I agree with you that it must be some part of some people's minds
01:37:34 But who are you to say that that is how they all think? No one at all. No one at all
01:37:40 Yeah, that's that's owned that's fair owned
01:37:43 Um, I don't know. We've got we've got a lot of people in this chat that are just sitting on the sidelines
01:37:48 It's just waiting for the mouse to be fed. That's true. That's that's fine including the rhythm bot. What do you have to say for yourself?
01:37:54 Yeah, they just waddle on up to the trough here and just
01:37:58 I don't know. I just want to say about this thing. I feel like
01:38:01 The way we talk about autism is just extremely uninformed. Am I wrong there?
01:38:09 No, of course, so and you know what? I bet not to be you know, I bet we have a fair number of autistic people listening right now
01:38:17 Yeah, let us know what you think about this fetishization
01:38:19 That would be interesting because like I always feel like
01:38:22 The the whole like autism joke is like very much like done intentionally
01:38:26 Yeah, and it's just for the the giggles right and like no one should be taking it seriously
01:38:32 That's very true. I wonder if Digi takes it seriously. You have any expertise. Let us know ladies and gentlemen
01:38:37 Oh, yeah, all right. Let's see. We got here's another one. Oh boy. I think I know where this is going
01:38:41 This is from how many more do we have? I've got six more
01:38:44 Okay, yeah, that's reasonable. We've got dentist defender. Let's uh, let's see what he's got to say
01:38:51 I know that digi's not going to be here because the podcast never works the way that it should
01:38:58 But the idea that brushing your teeth is not necessary is just so smooth brain
01:39:07 I'm really screaming in the car when I heard digi talk about this. So he's only focused on cavities
01:39:14 Essentially, well, there's so many other aspects of your teeth that you need to protect
01:39:18 If your enamel gets thin boy, you're gonna get fucked up
01:39:22 There's so many things that brushing helps with and like if you have your wisdom teeth in like you got to clean those
01:39:28 And let me recommend boys flossing is a must
01:39:32 Well, that's it. It's getting long and I just I I was screaming screaming and in my car
01:39:38 Please stop this man. I was digi was digi. He was again. Yeah, he sure was. Yeah, he was. Yeah
01:39:45 Well, okay, we have a dentist listening to our podcast, but well, this makes a dentist defender
01:39:50 Maybe we cannot we cannot we all agree that he's wrong. Oh, yeah
01:39:54 I I mean, there's people here in this chat. I mean, I mean, I don't take great care of my teeth
01:39:58 I'm sure Nate takes really good care of his teeth. I try all across the range of spectrum here. We can all agree that
01:40:04 Yeah, I would assume that I probably take only slightly better care of my teeth than digi
01:40:09 But I'm a hundred percent able to confirm and like admit that it's a terrible decision
01:40:14 And I'm a worse person. Yeah. Well, if I if I don't brush my teeth, I know that I'm doing something wrong
01:40:19 It's a mistake. I think digi would agree. I want to speak on his defense because this is not here
01:40:24 It's just like the things that we care about that are helped by us brushing our teeth
01:40:30 Could those just be things digi does not care about and therefore there's no objective standard
01:40:35 Well, no, no, you heard him talking last episode. I'm very convinced that digi is not educated on what will happen to your teeth
01:40:43 That's unreasonable
01:40:44 Like maybe maybe maybe if we looked into it, right? Yeah, maybe if we looked into it, we would find
01:40:51 That not brushing your teeth does not, you know, it does not have certain effects on
01:40:57 But like there's so many things that yeah, this guy's right like like like worn enamel and and stuff
01:41:02 And gingivitis and shit, you know got clean your gums, you know
01:41:04 Yeah, your gums gingivitis your gums, you know, you can get fucking you can fucking rot your teeth roots and need a root canal
01:41:10 like there's
01:41:11 there's
01:41:12 Well, ben did you just oh, I know I know there's a point wasn't like just neglect your teeth
01:41:16 He was his real point was like and this guy was just refuting him that like if you just don't consume sugar
01:41:22 That like solves most of the issue
01:41:24 Uh
01:41:25 That was his major pretty sure that's totally wrong and stupid. I don't know. Uh, well, I think I don't know enough to say one way or the other
01:41:31 But it sounds more wrong than right that would affect that that that sounds like some bull that sounds like some bullshit
01:41:37 Childhood like parents saying oh, don't eat sugar. It'll rot your teeth like grown up
01:41:42 I
01:41:46 That's not the be all end all like like thing that has to do with teeth health
01:41:49 That's not the only thing that matters. It might be the biggest one. I mean, I don't know. I have no idea
01:41:54 I have no idea. I don't think I don't really think back in the middle ages
01:41:58 There was not a whole ton of sugar for the peasants and I don't think they had perfect teeth
01:42:04 Just throwing that one out there
01:42:06 Fair point
01:42:07 But I will say that when sugar did was introduced in like, you know, like like late renaissance
01:42:12 They did have really bad teeth sugar is bad for your teeth, but not so bad. Fair enough. Fair enough. It is the be all end all
01:42:19 That's all I'm saying. All right. Let's let's move on or next one here. This is from uh, keep it going. She pollution. She pollution
01:42:25 That sounds like someone else go
01:42:27 Hey guys, so I followed Ben Sain's advice and started fasting. My goal was reach a week, but sadly
01:42:33 Uh, a few hours ago. I ate something
01:42:36 I really hate myself now actually like
01:42:38 Yeah, I think you too. It tastes good
01:42:40 so
01:42:41 Yeah, I mean, I guess I can still be proud of myself for reaching for
01:42:46 three
01:42:47 Yeah, it's three hours without eating food
01:42:52 There it is. Please let me know if you have any advice so I can reach a week and it's not um
01:42:58 To the other members my question is what will you have a hard time not doing for a week that isn't a basic human need
01:43:04 or sexual
01:43:05 Okay, my yeah, what do you got my?
01:43:08 My advice you made it to three. Well, can you count to uh seven times 24 is 140 is one
01:43:15 16 can you count to 168?
01:43:17 Just make it to 168 and then and then you'll have done it do that
01:43:21 Hourly add one to that and then just do it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean don't eat until you hit 168 practical advice
01:43:27 He should probably take like vitamins and water lots of water. Maybe
01:43:31 Yeah, yeah, you keep like drinking water like you just fill up your gut. You don't feel like eating
01:43:37 Take a multivitamin. You know drink drink tea drink drink tea. Yeah, apple cider vinegar
01:43:44 As caffeine it tastes great zero calories
01:43:48 Tea is beautiful caffeine has so little I mean tea has so little caffeine that might have you always say that
01:43:53 I don't feel it. I don't I feel the caffeine rush and I drink caffeine. I'm desensitized do it
01:43:59 Speaking of caffeine. I remember when we were young. I remember one time you bought like a powdered keg
01:44:04 Not like a bottle of powdered caffeine or something. Was that am I remembering that right? Is that a real thing? Was it creatine?
01:44:11 I thought it was fucking literally caffeine and I don't remember buying powdered caffeine
01:44:16 I'm pretty sure like like caffeine is lethal if you eat it straight. I mean, that's why I was concerned at the time
01:44:22 I mean actually my housemate had like a bag of like I probably wasn't straight
01:44:26 But it was a bag of powder and I would take like a little scoop of like
01:44:29 A tiny like a core like an eighth of a teaspoon or something and I would like dissolve it in my in my
01:44:34 Some of the time dude the first time I ever had a five-hour energy
01:44:38 I felt like I was the elephant's foot from Chernobyl
01:44:41 I felt like like like like the acid was going through my throat and infecting all my body from the inside out
01:44:47 And I was turning into like a small blob of like radioactive energy and that like all my friends were going to have to build like an
01:44:52 Iron cast around me to keep the power in because I was like I was like I was like turning to like a black hole
01:44:57 I was going to like exactly one by one
01:45:00 Minecraft dot block and once I reached maximum capacity. I was just explode out in all directions in fact all around that's why I felt
01:45:07 I'm drinking one sip of a five-hour energy
01:45:11 Uh, I've never had I've literally never had a five-hour energy. I don't know if I'm having this
01:45:15 Okay, okay
01:45:16 The most distinct thing about fire energy is that you'll get super hot and you feel like you're on fire
01:45:20 You feel like you are in acid and on fire. Yeah, that sounds awful. Yeah, it's really awful
01:45:25 It's really like crazy. Those be vitamins. Well, fuck. Yeah
01:45:29 Does anyone have an answer for this um like things that you could go
01:45:33 For a week without doing sexual or food or something
01:45:37 I mean video games. I guess like I really like video games though. I pretty regularly can go for a week without playing them though
01:45:42 It would really be hard for me to not go on the internet at all. Yeah
01:45:46 The internet oh social media in general would be a tough one. Yeah, which is relevant because it's funny. Michelle

01:47:55 Perfect vertical slice of a terrible stupid question
01:48:01 Uh for that the pcp
01:48:04 It has every everything bad about it
01:48:07 As long as I continue to hold a supreme authority over the voicemails. My people will have their voice
01:48:14 As long as you allow in the 17 year olds with no direction who want to just pair everything that you say and claim that's philosophy
01:48:21 I just feel like this is how a cult starts with like aimless 17 year olds who will just you know, they want to they want to hear a
01:48:27 Voice of a of strength and direction in their lives
01:48:30 Clab you and me buddy. Nobody have to settle with you. Why does this person think that he's the only one that didn't like the dreams
01:48:36 Nobody like like the dreams everyone in the comments was like don't let anyone talk about their dreams again
01:48:41 This isn't a point specifically about the dreams. I think this guy is talking about like in the there there's been in the discord
01:48:46 Uh thing there's been people being like hashtag let mage dream and then I've just come in saying like no dreams are banned
01:48:52 No dreams of any kind pure raw
01:48:55 Materialism like I think that's what he's talking about and and shit. Yeah. Yeah, I see. All right fair enough
01:49:01 So so good on you clab. Uh, you're a good man
01:49:03 I got nothing but respect for you. You want to tell him how to live his life. He needs direction

01:49:17 Passionate speech
01:49:20 I really find best guy ever is passion inspirational and it's inspired me to make my own youtube channel
01:49:27 Where I will be discussing my favorite anime. Uh, just like my hero
01:49:35 Only to destroy him and and take his power one of these days
01:49:38 I plan to trample him and leave him in the dust do as I say not as I do
01:49:42 And I know and I know that he would do the same for me. So no hard feelings buster
01:49:47 Thanks for thanks for taking my call and have a nice day
01:49:50 Hashtag racism
01:49:53 Hashtag a future for white children. Uh, all right moving on. Uh, this was one from uh,
01:49:59 Okay, this is a weird. I think it's a polish name. It's like
01:50:02 simon with szy mo n
01:50:06 with
01:50:06 new ski
01:50:08 size
01:50:09 Simon with new ski. All right. Let's see what he's got. That doesn't sound right
01:50:13 I don't even know why I'm here. I can't even speak english properly
01:50:19 I'm from some shitty eastern european country
01:50:23 fuck
01:50:25 Well, okay, what I'm trying to settle down is hearing mage talking fluent english despite not being a native speaker
01:50:32 It's very
01:50:33 motivating
01:50:35 And I think I developed my vocabulary and listening comprehension skills
01:50:40 Thanks to the pcp
01:50:43 Thanks. Okay. Okay. Good job mage mage mage says don't play voicemails that are just questions
01:50:50 People who send them are basically cheating and it's kind of redundant because you know, you have
01:50:56 Not anymore. Not anymore. Yeah for that
01:50:59 Okay, duly noted. Okay. Okay mage says that her mage says that her
01:51:03 Knowledge of english that her like ability to learn english was like her best subject in school
01:51:08 And like she says that she's just like real just took to it really really, uh
01:51:12 Fast. I I want to guess. I'm going to ask you. Are you
01:51:18 Austrian
01:51:19 I want to know are you ash or some country around that area? Please respond. I'm based on his name
01:51:25 I'm guessing he's polish because like his name matches the polish, uh, like ski at the end. Oh, what was it?
01:51:31 Yeah, it's yeah, he's probably was new ski something like that. Okay, uh, oh wait
01:51:36 W's or v's in polish, right? So it's vizniewski. No, that's not right. I don't know whatever and I think yeah, okay
01:51:42 So that's he'd probably polish or or I don't know ukrainian. Yeah. Okay. Uh, anyway, uh, what was this question?
01:51:50 He didn't have a quote. Well, no, what do you say? Oh, well his like point was that like he was saying he was
01:51:54 Oh, but he's saying that non-question. Yeah, non-question
01:51:58 voicemails shouldn't be said because it's redundant
01:52:01 Uh, but now it's not a problem because I guess we've just killed text questions
01:52:07 I want to say stick with learning english and I also want to say similarly that I love you
01:52:13 You you live in europe and I love you and I respect you and and like hashtag god
01:52:20 I wish that were me munchie. You're one of these fucking americans who's like, oh my god
01:52:24 If only you lived in europe, I'd have so much culture and personality and I'd actually have a yeah
01:52:28 Why don't you go vote for obama? You fucking lived hard
01:52:31 a globalist piece of shit
01:52:35 Okay, I want to go to a country to experience what the country is like and its specific culture
01:52:42 How embarrassing america is the only culture you need to know about boy. So get used to it
01:52:48 You should visit other countries
01:52:49 But like if you lived in another country, then there wouldn't be anything special. I got a plan
01:52:53 I got a plan for you munchie. That's not true at all because I
01:52:55 I've grown up in america. I've grown up in america. So no, no, no my what I mean is if you had lived your whole life in like
01:53:02 Like if you were if I don't let's say this guy's polish. There's nothing. There's nothing cool about being
01:53:07 Sorry, wizniewski. There's nothing cool about being polish because it's just a country like any other country
01:53:12 Well, okay, I argue that there's cool things about being polish in the same way that there's cool things about being america
01:53:17 You guys are just reading anti american sentiments for no reason to what I'm saying
01:53:22 I'm saying that you seem to you seem to be jealous that he lives somewhere other than america and I'm like
01:53:29 Nowhere, it's cool. I'm I'm not saying that america is bad in any way
01:53:33 I know you're not saying that I appreciate the culture from which from whence this guy has crawled out stop
01:53:40 Fetishizing foreigners munchie cease it immediately. That's you stop sexualizing. It's you. He's a good man. He doesn't you don't know
01:53:47 You cast an elsewhere friend. You don't know anything about his culture. Why do you respect it? Yeah?
01:53:53 I don't know. Okay. I don't know. I I literally okay. I don't know what country. He's from but I do exactly
01:54:00 I like the general history from that that that from eastern europe
01:54:05 I like I like the sort of things that have occurred there
01:54:08 I think that they're interesting and I enjoy the history from whence he has crawled out from
01:54:12 I wonder if any poll would be offended for you to lump all of eastern europe in together into one thing
01:54:17 You'd be like, oh, it's all you know, I like the general things
01:54:21 They're all the same
01:54:32 Apparently people in what we call eastern europe do not like that turn really they don't like being lumped together as quote eastern europe
01:54:39 Hashtag munchie is racist
01:54:41 But I've also got a plan. I've got a plan for you munchie. Here it is
01:54:44 You're such an absolute unit such an absolute massive lad
01:54:48 Then why don't you individually secede from the union and go be a individual member state of the united of the european union
01:54:55 Just go like float out in the ocean and just attach yourself to the you know the the big octopus tentacles
01:55:00 Go join all it all i'm hearing right now. Yeah is you like something else and that's a problem
01:55:06 Like where you are now that's like you you just can't like anything else if you like another thing
01:55:11 That means you pride that above literally every other like nation on earth
01:55:15 Okay, I will say I will say that I think that you have a little bit of grass is greener going on
01:55:19 I think a little bit of that. I I don't think america is bad in any way
01:55:24 But I've said I said nothing about america being even you're like, oh, oh you grew you grew up in some you grew up in poll
01:55:32 Oh, that's so cool. Like that's
01:55:37 Why is it bad to say? Oh, that's an interesting situation that you have come from an interesting situation
01:55:47 Literally everyone in the world has an interesting situation then because they grew up in x country
01:55:53 Yes, that is true. Yeah, I know everyone's boring everyone's life is boring and dumb and I don't care
01:56:00 Um, I'm saying is that I'm period and I'm deeply in a romantic love
01:56:06 With all things history and european and I think it's nice when we get to have a fan
01:56:11 That's not from america because that's the majority of east
01:56:14 We've got a lot of fans from we've done a lot of like south american fans and european fans. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's
01:56:21 I shout out lat american pcb fans of their day and everyone's like oh like uno uno uno uno. Thank you, manci
01:56:27 Thank you very much. Listen manci. We tried multiculturalism. It didn't work. We're shutting it down. We're ending this once and for all
01:56:33 It's over. Yeah, okay. That's all right. Let's do it. Okay. I'm like a true bloomer
01:56:38 Like i'm julie says i'm just like attacked on the senate floor and i'm just being like like gang mob friend
01:56:43 Because I said that I like hearing right now. I like europe. That's that was my crime here that I liked europe
01:56:49 Yeah, I bet you also like uh, you know, and I also like fascism and communism too much
01:56:53 I bet you also hate capitalism. Don't you?
01:56:57 Uh, speaking of capitalism, we got another call from a dank wizard
01:57:00 Phone and in from eastern europe to use the racist term. All right, here we go. What do you got?
01:57:06 Hey, nate. It's your boy. Uh a dank wizard. Good to see you
01:57:09 I'm the dude who sent you those kingdom hearts cards a while back
01:57:12 Oh, yeah, you didn't open all of them. You fucking piece of shit. Where the fuck did you?
01:57:16 What did you do with them? What the fuck did you do with them?
01:57:18 They're I want to know what the fuck you do if you
01:57:21 Actually, yeah, I think I did because those things go for a shit tone on ebay. God damn it
01:57:26 You only open like
01:57:29 I think you had like three or four more you can open it like six packs or something and you know, I
01:57:34 I appreciate that you even who would think these are valuable. They're shitty knockoff kingdom hearts trading cards
01:57:39 I was just wondering if you were gonna ever like open up again like on a video
01:57:42 I can't believe you would throw that away. I can't believe that. I open like three and they suck also
01:57:48 I totally relate to you with that blanky story in the last episode man
01:57:52 Like me and you all yeah exact same experience with the blanky like I would shove that shit up my nose too
01:57:58 Like the only different thing is I would like hell. Yeah
01:58:01 Feel between hell. Yeah, there was really fucking weird and gross
01:58:06 For some reason insanely gratifying really fucking weird, but uh, I have a stroke
01:58:17 I remember blanky very clearly and I but I I had no idea you were selling
01:58:22 Okay, all right the whole shoving it up my nose thing's a bit blown out of proportion
01:58:25 Like I did that sometimes. I don't let's forget. I was like five at the time. So let's not be too hard
01:58:33 Yeah, last last episode I think I told the like, you know, maybe it was more than one episode ago
01:58:38 I don't remember. I don't remember. I'm using my mind. It could have been too
01:58:41 Wait, was that not on the bonus episode? Which by the way, you can get access to at pc at pay at patreon.com slash
01:58:49 Uh, god, what's the procrastinator? The procrastinators this month, uh, the bonus episode we reviewed. It's a film cast
01:58:56 We reviewed classic film the ant boy. Indeed. So if you want to hear our thoughts on that check that out
01:59:02 Toss us some coins. Listen a dank wizard. Uh, I apologize. I definitely threw those away
01:59:07 I had no idea that they meant anything to anyone and uh, I don't regret it either
01:59:13 Wait, what were they? What kind of cards? They were kingdom hearts trading cards an apparent dude
01:59:17 I don't believe that they're valuable. How much could they pass? Look you see you send anything to me
01:59:22 It goes into a black hole where you have no control over what happens to it after that point and everyone needs to know that going in
01:59:28 um
01:59:29 So, you know, I appreciate you sending stuff and I would hope that you would be not discouraged from doing it again
01:59:35 If you were so inclined, but uh, like like what am I gonna do fucking open up a bunch of packs and be like, oh
01:59:40 Yeah, I recognize heartless and nobody's and so yeah, dude, um
01:59:44 Like like three three kingdom hearts original booster packs go for like 25 bucks
01:59:50 So that's too little money for me to worry about like selling them on ebay. That's too much work
01:59:55 That's a lot more than I expected about single cards though
01:59:58 If the packs are worth my the single cards are probably worth more
02:00:01 If we're talking about like I mean yeah, it's like the rare ones probably
02:00:04 Exactly. That's where the real money's at magic the gathering or even yugio
02:00:08 I have some context as like what's a good card?
02:00:10 What's a bad card and to like know and like I can get excited when I open them. I have no
02:00:15 Ground like I'm not grounded to know what's a good pull. What's a bad pull?
02:00:19 So it's totally boring to open those packs. It's just like, uh, yes things from kingdom hearts
02:00:24 I could also just gotta find out what the chase cards are. Yeah, I mean, I guess you're right
02:00:30 Okay, uh, sora wisdom form level three kingdom hearts tcg card, uh, 40 dollars, uh buy it now. It's not bad
02:00:38 That's all right. Roxas level one, uh, sr foil break of dawn kingdom hearts tcg card
02:00:45 Also, 40 dollars behemoth level six sr foil disney kingdom hearts tcg 15 dollars phantom level five
02:00:53 18 and so on and so forth they could have thrown out
02:00:56 Whoops a hundred dollars worth. He might have maybe I mean it's possible
02:01:00 Look, I'm sorry dank wizard. You obviously are into it. I apologize as a non player
02:01:06 I had no grounding. He didn't know what I got and just assumed they were worthless. So my bad
02:01:11 All right, we got one more voicemail here. This is from a mozilla fennekin long time
02:01:17 Yep, yeah, let's uh, let's see what he's got for it. I know that person as a ben saint patron. That's how I know him
02:01:23 He's a patron of yeah, too. I think
02:01:26 Which pokemon would be the best podcaster? He was uh, he was in one nuzlocke. Oh
02:01:32 Hang on which pokemon to be the best podcaster cast for him
02:01:36 Wait
02:01:41 Oh, it's a joke. Oh, it's a joke you guys
02:01:44 Oh, how unfortunate
02:01:49 Well
02:01:53 Yeah, they both got cast their names come on down to neo milwaukee. Yeah, but which but which form of oh, uh, I love that
02:02:00 So in new Los Angeles city, you can see this line you can see economy crumble
02:02:11 No, that song sucks
02:02:14 All right, it's actually pretty good. Okay. I can't believe
02:02:16 Okay, that's such a cold reception. I got such a cold. I don't know why I don't know. I have no idea how
02:02:22 Why for me by the way, we're talking about ratty fuckers cop killer stuff at the moment bear with us for a second
02:02:28 This was from the uh from the flag slash national anthem slash tourism video content. I'll tell you why munchie
02:02:34 Uh, that's rich dot tv slash ratty flickers cop killer. That song was fairly verbose and I couldn't
02:02:42 I don't know. I couldn't like get into it at first and the melody wasn't particularly memorable
02:02:47 Uh, I don't know. Okay. I liked it and I think it is a good and suitable anthem for the city
02:02:54 I don't think it's sixon's best. Well, you know what it is. It is his best work, but I do like it
02:02:59 I don't like that song whatever like it doesn't have like a memorable like crazy hook or anything
02:03:04 But the thing is I liked the rat. I liked the rap more. I liked sixon's rap more, but it was less of an anthem
02:03:09 Uh, fucking what is it? I was gonna say the thing is like a j schoops
02:03:12 Like I I think of so much more fondly and then I'm just like I'm not saying it's like a million times better anything
02:03:18 Even though it is uh, but what I'm saying is uh, like I I listened to that a bunch and like
02:03:23 Listened to it a bunch and got way into it
02:03:26 And that was cool. Uh, whereas I like didn't do that with sixon. So like
02:03:31 Okay, I like that sixon's was like a real anthem, but also had rfc k stuff in it
02:03:36 I feel like that was it was a nice touch to have that's sort of like yeah
02:03:39 Like our world it is a national anthem that you could hear but had in this war calling cards
02:03:44 There's the best thing it was the
02:03:47 Tom you gotta join rfc k you gotta join so god listen. No, it's it's common digi
02:03:52 I want to fucking punch both of you and your stupid faces. You're so dumb. You're so fucking dumb
02:03:57 You can't even fucking beat mega man 11
02:04:04 Well, I would have okay, I had to go to sleep. Um, it's just you just listen to what we're saying. We're speaking plain english
02:04:11 We're talking about uh, uh, there's a there's a fucking city
02:04:14 It's full of slime and we had a contest to pick the national anthem and we fucking run
02:04:19 That's it. There's how hard is this to understand?
02:04:22 Like people just don't get so much about it. I understand linguistically what you're saying
02:04:26 But because I'm not actively participating the context is not there therefore. It means nothing to me
02:04:32 It takes a while to understand what's going on. This is why me and digi both said
02:04:37 Ben please make a pcp university slash style video on
02:04:42 Whoa, whoa
02:04:46 It would be a joint one if anything. No because ben was here when we asked it, okay
02:04:50 I've just I mean, I've just got the I've got the necessary charisma
02:04:54 Oh
02:04:55 That's something a killer would say so that's that's a brazen lie that a killer would say
02:05:00 Um lying right through his fucking shoddy teeth. All right. Well, that's it for questions and uh,
02:05:07 Okay, just just one more quick thing. I know I know it's going on about rfck
02:05:11 But like I I've literally written a new like text channel that is like the text that you are set into if you join the server
02:05:18 From any of the links now, so no matter what whenever you join the server you go to this channel
02:05:23 Much easier, but I don't but I don't actually find much you need a video. I don't actually
02:05:28 No, I said it. I made it so that the only invite link is going to that channel
02:05:31 Does it do you do you get a little like response blurb? That's like you have arrived at the juvenile detention center
02:05:36 No, me and me and me and john me and jubo. We're talking about that much. That's great ben. That's great
02:05:40 What you need is a video an introductory. Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're right. I don't disagree
02:05:46 But I'm saying is we need a what is endless war kind of like how to play
02:05:50 What is I'm saying is that if you join the server then you can tell with like literally less than one minute of reading
02:05:56 Exactly what is going on in everything you need to play the game the secondary thing that made me
02:06:02 Hesitant as ben has said it took like it's going to take like at least an hour a day of like effort to keep up with this
02:06:09 Shit, and I don't I guess
02:06:12 All you know like all I know what we're saying just read that blurb and then you know the basic what's happening
02:06:18 I think you can you could give it as much or as little as you want, right?
02:06:22 You can engage with it as much or as little as you want and you know, but you won't get that respect until you really come in
02:06:29 I was just saying that since we nerfed sparring
02:06:31 It's not like Nate you were you were sparring. I was just sparring ben, but now I've been completely fucked by
02:06:37 But that wasn't that hard to do because you could just kind of pop look at your phone every 10 minutes or so
02:06:41 Pop off a scar and then it was great. I missed it so much. Yeah, but it was but it was too it was too good
02:06:46 In fact, it's so sparring was you were literally you were literally the only one. Yeah, literally the only one
02:06:52 The only one who matters I am the ultimate
02:06:54 All right, I am the slimecorp delegate and I will be treated with respect god damn it
02:06:58 Well, then how come you got fucking iced by fat yoshi?
02:07:01 Fat yoshi is a piece of shit coward who didn't have the balls to follow me to the mind
02:07:05 He's never done a day of work in his fucking life that fat
