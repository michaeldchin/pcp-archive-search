00:00:00 I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a-
00:00:02 That son of a-
00:00:04 That son of a-
00:00:06 That son of a-
00:00:08 That son of a-
00:00:10 Son of a-
00:00:12 Ah, hello, good morning!
00:00:14 Ah, good to morgan!
00:00:16 Good morning!
00:00:18 To an early morning,
00:00:20 PCP, I am up at five?
00:00:22 Well, actually I woke up at three.
00:00:24 I didn't mean to wake up until five, but I woke up early.
00:00:26 Oh, so you woke up, I was assuming you would stay up.
00:00:28 For such an early-
00:00:30 No, not this time, I woke up-
00:00:32 I had stayed up all night the previous night,
00:00:34 so I wanted to go to bed early last night,
00:00:36 and then wake up early this morning.
00:00:38 I appreciate you agreeing to move the episode earlier.
00:00:40 The reason why I wanted to record
00:00:42 early this morning
00:00:44 is because I want daylight.
00:00:46 I wanted to record early this morning,
00:00:48 because I want daylight.
00:00:50 I wanted to record early this morning,
00:00:52 because I want daylight.
00:00:54 I want daylight.
00:00:56 I wanted to record before daylight
00:00:58 and have daylight available.
00:01:00 Big day for me.
00:01:02 I'm gonna try and record that video
00:01:04 that I've been teasing
00:01:06 forever.
00:01:08 I think I'm gonna try and make today the day, yeah.
00:01:10 Yeah, alright.
00:01:12 That's good.
00:01:14 That's what I wanted the daylight for.
00:01:16 Yeah, I'm moving
00:01:18 two days from now,
00:01:20 so I
00:01:22 don't know if I'll be able to do anything tomorrow,
00:01:24 because there's been like guys
00:01:26 working in my house, like doing renovations
00:01:28 on the building,
00:01:30 and they come during the week,
00:01:32 and so on tomorrow's Monday, so they might be
00:01:34 all around making noise
00:01:36 and stuff.
00:01:38 They might, they might.
00:01:40 So I don't know if I will be able to
00:01:42 do anything today, but
00:01:44 or tomorrow.
00:01:46 So I'm gonna try and do it all today,
00:01:48 and just see how it goes, see how it works out.
00:01:52 I'm pretty nervous.
00:01:54 I'm scared. What if it's bad?
00:01:56 I don't know.
00:01:58 How many hours of recording do you think
00:02:00 it will take to get through?
00:02:02 I don't know.
00:02:04 I could see it.
00:02:08 I don't know.
00:02:10 It could take all day.
00:02:12 It could take multiple days.
00:02:14 I might not be able to finish.
00:02:18 But I'm not sure.
00:02:20 There's nothing wrong with like
00:02:22 having the second part
00:02:24 of the video, and you just say,
00:02:26 yeah, I'm somewhere else now. Okay, continuing.
00:02:28 Yeah, it wouldn't be,
00:02:30 it wouldn't be the worst thing
00:02:32 in the world.
00:02:38 I want to continue to be cagey about it.
00:02:40 I don't want to say exactly what it is
00:02:42 until it comes out.
00:02:44 But I have, let's just say
00:02:46 I had to make
00:02:48 a prop.
00:02:50 And the
00:02:52 prop will be used
00:02:54 during the video.
00:02:56 He's going to shove a dildo up his ass.
00:02:58 It will be, this is my only fans
00:03:00 announcement.
00:03:02 The prop will be used
00:03:04 and irrevocably altered during
00:03:06 the video. And so should I have to
00:03:08 re-record, I would need to make it
00:03:10 again, which would, I mean,
00:03:12 it would probably take me a day to
00:03:14 remake it, which would be annoying, but
00:03:16 it's fine.
00:03:18 I would do it.
00:03:20 Damn, what else
00:03:22 do I have to say about that?
00:03:24 Oh,
00:03:26 I bought a
00:03:28 man, I've been trying to get the
00:03:30 lighting right, and that's been
00:03:32 weird, because I have my
00:03:34 all right,
00:03:36 let me explain. I have my overhead
00:03:38 light, which is just,
00:03:40 you know,
00:03:42 regular, I think they're incandescent bulbs
00:03:44 in a lamp on the ceiling.
00:03:46 And I thought that would be fine.
00:03:48 But then when I tried to do some
00:03:50 test filming, things were
00:03:52 it's not the
00:03:54 thing, you could see everything, but
00:03:56 the colors were washed out. I think there wasn't
00:03:58 enough light.
00:04:00 I think my eyes are adjusted to it, but I
00:04:02 think the light is too dim for
00:04:04 the colors to be
00:04:06 visible. Yeah, the lighting
00:04:08 a set or whatever.
00:04:10 It's so much brighter
00:04:12 than you would imagine.
00:04:14 It's funny,
00:04:16 I
00:04:18 compared it with
00:04:20 that and an extra light, and
00:04:22 when I don't have the extra light,
00:04:24 the image looks just as
00:04:26 bright, but it's just more colorful
00:04:28 when the second light is
00:04:30 on it, is the only real
00:04:32 difference. And I think the colors
00:04:34 are important.
00:04:36 I had
00:04:38 considered ordering a ring light
00:04:40 or something, and I had put it off
00:04:42 and put it off and I never did it, because I thought
00:04:44 maybe I didn't need it. Turns out I did need it.
00:04:46 But it was too late,
00:04:48 it wouldn't get here in time, so I went to the
00:04:50 hardware store and I picked up
00:04:52 an LED work light,
00:04:54 which had a
00:04:56 it was one of the brighter ones they had, and it
00:04:58 had a nice middle of the road
00:05:00 temperature, like light
00:05:02 temperature.
00:05:04 So it's pretty good,
00:05:06 it works, it's what I'm using
00:05:08 to light the scene,
00:05:10 and it did make the colors pop, and it looked okay.
00:05:12 The problem is
00:05:14 that it was really bright, and it's
00:05:16 not bright enough that I could, but it's not
00:05:18 bright enough that I can put it a long distance away.
00:05:20 So I have to put it fairly
00:05:22 close to me to light the shot,
00:05:24 and it is
00:05:26 um,
00:05:28 it's bright that at that distance
00:05:30 it glares off of me, and it
00:05:32 casts a big shadow behind
00:05:34 me on the...
00:05:36 almost.
00:05:38 Yeah, and that's bad.
00:05:40 That's not good, it doesn't look good, so
00:05:42 I tried
00:05:44 Did you put a piece of paper
00:05:46 in front of it to diffuse it?
00:05:48 Yeah, I tried that,
00:05:50 it didn't really
00:05:52 it didn't really make a difference,
00:05:54 you know, to really diffuse light
00:05:56 you actually have to shine it
00:05:58 on like a big
00:06:00 on like a big piece of paper
00:06:02 or something.
00:06:04 Some of those, the lights
00:06:06 that I've seen, they have
00:06:08 like the light, and then like
00:06:10 an umbrella, like a big
00:06:12 cone that goes around it
00:06:14 and at the end of that is like...
00:06:16 The softbox sort of things.
00:06:18 Yeah.
00:06:20 I tried to sort of make an artificial one,
00:06:22 I tried to, I cut out some cardboard
00:06:24 and I made a thing to fix on the light
00:06:26 and I put aluminum foil
00:06:28 with the idea being
00:06:30 that it would sort of reflect
00:06:32 the extra light
00:06:34 that was going to the sides, reflect
00:06:36 and sort of keep it in this like sort of cone
00:06:38 that I built, and sort of direct it
00:06:40 straight forward, so that I could put
00:06:42 the light further back
00:06:44 but have more of the light
00:06:46 shine on me in a more narrow
00:06:48 direction
00:06:50 to light the scene just as well
00:06:52 from a further distance back
00:06:54 and it didn't really
00:06:56 make much of a difference, I think it was
00:06:58 kind of a waste of time.
00:07:00 I think...
00:07:02 Okay, the alternative
00:07:04 was leaving my window open because I do get
00:07:06 bright sunlight through my window.
00:07:10 The problems with that
00:07:12 is that, one, I have to record
00:07:14 during daylight hours.
00:07:16 Two,
00:07:18 it's variable if there's like cloud coverage
00:07:20 which is a little annoying.
00:07:22 Yeah.
00:07:24 Three, it's actually,
00:07:26 the sunlight is not directly
00:07:28 on me, but it's nevertheless
00:07:30 bright enough that there's sort of
00:07:32 it sort of glares off me, it sort of gives
00:07:34 me sort of white highlights on my forehead
00:07:36 and stuff if I leave the windows open
00:07:38 and that's not good.
00:07:40 So, before I try
00:07:42 anything today, I'm going to try
00:07:44 and I have some sort of like see-through
00:07:46 gauzy curtains, like a purple one
00:07:48 and a black one. I think
00:07:50 I'm going to try and just put up very
00:07:52 thin curtains and see if maybe that
00:07:54 diffuses or softens the light enough
00:07:56 that I don't get the glare while still
00:07:58 lighting the shot well enough with
00:08:00 like, you know, the sunlight
00:08:02 and I think that
00:08:04 might be the best.
00:08:06 I think that's going to be
00:08:08 probably how I do it
00:08:10 because I just want the shot to look
00:08:12 not ugly, right? It's not
00:08:14 anything fancy.
00:08:16 I just want it not, I want it not to be
00:08:18 glaring and I want it not to have
00:08:20 like a strong backshadow behind me which
00:08:22 would be distracting.
00:08:24 I want the light to look natural.
00:08:26 I just want a nice neutral
00:08:28 natural, bright
00:08:30 shot.
00:08:32 You know?
00:08:34 Surprisingly difficult to achieve sometimes.
00:08:36 Yeah, the very like default
00:08:38 nothing going on shot is very
00:08:40 hard to get happening.
00:08:42 I think in
00:08:44 when I did like all the stuff in my
00:08:46 hypocrite like skits
00:08:48 I didn't invest in a light.
00:08:50 I had like a lamp
00:08:52 and sometimes I would place it somewhere
00:08:54 and it would do.
00:08:56 It would be like very
00:08:58 very like DIY
00:09:00 and then I would only do a skit for like a few
00:09:02 seconds so it's
00:09:04 I changed camera angles.
00:09:06 I don't think any of my shots
00:09:08 looked like terrible except when they did.
00:09:10 Yeah.
00:09:12 But I did not have like a professional setup.
00:09:14 It's just about getting the right
00:09:16 amount of light mainly.
00:09:18 Yeah.
00:09:20 So if you have anything fancy like having like
00:09:22 ooh a nice little
00:09:24 what do you call
00:09:26 is it called an edge light?
00:09:28 You know when they try to be fancy and they have
00:09:30 a little like colored light behind
00:09:32 the subject that sort of gives them like a little
00:09:34 like you know colored sort of outline
00:09:36 on one side of them.
00:09:38 And if you're like a really fancy streamer you have
00:09:40 two of them you have nice bisexual
00:09:42 lighting so you've got one edge light
00:09:44 one pink edge light on one side of you
00:09:46 and one blue edge light on the other side of
00:09:48 it up pink on one side blue on the other.
00:09:50 Yes I've seen such things.
00:09:52 And you get on twitch you get on discord
00:09:54 you start.
00:09:56 I was wondering like
00:09:58 I was wondering like
00:10:00 the lights
00:10:02 are always those colors
00:10:04 like why is there no like
00:10:06 green and orange streamer?
00:10:08 You know there's
00:10:10 when I think about edge lighting
00:10:12 the first example
00:10:14 that pops into my head
00:10:16 I know you've seen some
00:10:18 folding ideas Dan Olson videos
00:10:20 I've seen all of them yeah.
00:10:22 You've seen all of them okay so the one where
00:10:24 he talks about
00:10:26 not the flat earth documentary
00:10:28 no not in search of a flat earth
00:10:30 the other one
00:10:32 where he's talking about that other documentary
00:10:34 made by the Christian people
00:10:36 and they interviewed a bunch of physicists
00:10:38 and they didn't tell them what it was for
00:10:40 they had a hideous
00:10:42 green edge light
00:10:44 that they put on everyone
00:10:46 to make them look I don't know
00:10:48 sciency or something
00:10:50 sciency or sinister or slime core
00:10:52 I don't know
00:10:54 who knows what they were thinking
00:10:56 yeah
00:10:58 so
00:11:00 not doing anything like that
00:11:02 so I think I'm gonna have to
00:11:04 rely on the sun
00:11:06 which just means I have to
00:11:08 get everything recorded between
00:11:10 you know maybe like
00:11:12 7pm and probably like
00:11:14 7pm or 8pm
00:11:16 or something like that
00:11:18 the sun is like
00:11:20 I mean you have to be very lucky
00:11:22 to get a very long stretch
00:11:24 of the sun not being
00:11:26 interrupted by clouds
00:11:28 or anything
00:11:30 yeah
00:11:32 if you know it's a really nice day
00:11:34 then it will be alright but like
00:11:36 it's not gonna be like fully sunny
00:11:38 I think there probably will be some moments
00:11:40 when the clouds go overhead
00:11:42 and I think maybe I can just
00:11:44 either just deal with it
00:11:46 or maybe I can do a little bit
00:11:48 of adjustment in posts
00:11:50 to sort of brighten things
00:11:52 when it's dimmer
00:11:54 because the sun is extremely powerful
00:11:56 and like it fills the room
00:11:58 it makes everything so much brighter
00:12:00 the camera is like oh this is great
00:12:02 plenty of light as soon as the cloud comes up
00:12:04 all of that light goes really
00:12:06 like really far down on the camera
00:12:08 it's sort of like maybe it loses focus
00:12:10 as well if it's autofocus
00:12:12 you should definitely have
00:12:14 a light on you at all times
00:12:16 as well
00:12:18 I am going to have
00:12:20 I'm gonna use the LED work light
00:12:22 it looks pretty good
00:12:24 it's a good light
00:12:26 it's just too much at too close
00:12:28 and the back shadow
00:12:30 I need the sun to avoid
00:12:32 I need the work lights for it to be bright enough
00:12:34 that the colors aren't washed out
00:12:36 the back shadow from the work light
00:12:38 but the sun
00:12:40 the sun itself
00:12:42 gives sort of an uneven light
00:12:44 like you can see like I'm very much lit
00:12:46 more from one side than another
00:12:48 and that's not good
00:12:50 and I'll leave my room light on
00:12:52 just because why not
00:12:54 if you get a mirror in the room
00:12:56 you bounce that sunlight all over the place
00:12:58 oh you know what
00:13:00 that's what they do in like
00:13:02 to make a room like in
00:13:04 Victorian era or just
00:13:06 an old tiny room before lamps
00:13:08 and stuff
00:13:10 were that easy to use
00:13:12 get a huge mirror
00:13:14 brightens up a space
00:13:18 hmm I would have to adjust
00:13:20 the position of the mirror
00:13:22 as the day progress in order to
00:13:24 like continually move
00:13:26 but yeah I don't have a big mirror
00:13:28 but I mean I could
00:13:30 I have a cork board
00:13:32 in aluminum foil
00:13:34 and place it where the sun is shining
00:13:36 through the window
00:13:38 I don't think I actually
00:13:40 really get like direct sunlight
00:13:42 into my room
00:13:44 I'm not sure if I could really do that
00:13:46 well the thing with a mirror is like whatever light is in the room
00:13:48 will be bounced around
00:13:50 more
00:13:52 so it's not like you don't need to direct
00:13:54 some beam like in a video game
00:13:56 you just need it around so that
00:13:58 if the light is hitting it
00:14:00 somehow like bouncing off a wall
00:14:02 into the mirror it bounces back on to the wall
00:14:04 makes the wall brighter
00:14:06 you know what? I've got aluminum foil
00:14:08 I've got my cork board
00:14:10 I'm gonna do it
00:14:12 right now
00:14:14 just and I'll just see
00:14:16 we'll just see if it doesn't
00:14:18 you know I tried this with the artificial
00:14:20 the fake the DIY
00:14:22 softbox that didn't really
00:14:24 work out that's okay
00:14:26 that's fine
00:14:28 I'm just imagining
00:14:30 like your whole room is like
00:14:32 covered in foil
00:14:34 you're wearing like a mirror bowl suit
00:14:36 my whole room is covered in
00:14:38 bits of scrap paper
00:14:40 little pieces of tape
00:14:42 one corner is covered in
00:14:44 boxes
00:14:46 you know because I'm moving as well
00:14:48 as doing all this so I'm packing
00:14:54 nervous about moving
00:14:56 my current house
00:14:58 but the one thing that it does have
00:15:00 is that I do have privacy
00:15:02 I don't have to deal with
00:15:04 other people in this disgusting little
00:15:06 hole that I live in
00:15:08 is that not true for the
00:15:10 new place?
00:15:12 well it seems like the new place is gonna be a little more
00:15:14 like my old place where it's kind of
00:15:16 it's not it's like a house
00:15:18 you know
00:15:20 right now I live in an apartment
00:15:22 building
00:15:24 with you know everyone else lives on the
00:15:26 second floor
00:15:28 you live on a different floor and I hardly ever see them
00:15:30 I might sometimes pass them
00:15:32 in the kitchen and other than that we have nothing to do with each other
00:15:34 I might
00:15:36 have to see other people more
00:15:38 in my new place
00:15:40 and I don't know
00:15:42 I feel like that's probably good actually
00:15:44 but
00:15:46 it still makes me
00:15:48 anxious
00:15:50 what if I have to explain what I do
00:15:52 honestly yeah
00:15:54 I mean you remember
00:15:56 I told you I went to that birthday party
00:15:58 and mentioned being a
00:16:00 podcaster and I
00:16:02 felt so bad
00:16:08 I felt like I was a zoo animal
00:16:10 that has escaped from its
00:16:12 enclosure
00:16:16 I'm sorry is this tinfoil annoying?
00:16:18 I can't hear the tinfoil
00:16:20 I think discord
00:16:22 or something might be noise
00:16:24 removing it but you are
00:16:26 getting quieter because you're doing it
00:16:28 it's because I'm not facing
00:16:30 the microphone
00:16:32 well I will talk about something for a minute
00:16:36 you may have noticed
00:16:38 the RuneScape video I put up
00:16:40 on my pick and take
00:16:42 first comment
00:16:44 you liked it
00:16:46 you gave me a little like on that
00:16:48 yeah
00:16:50 yeah that's
00:16:52 I made it mostly for people
00:16:54 who like you who are like
00:16:56 what huh what's RuneScape
00:16:58 I don't know hardly nothing
00:17:00 about the mechanics of RuneScape
00:17:02 yeah it wasn't really mean to be
00:17:04 like here's how RuneScape works
00:17:06 but
00:17:08 I just wanted to like document this little thing
00:17:10 go watch the video if you're curious
00:17:12 it's a little challenge run
00:17:14 I'm doing on
00:17:16 old school RuneScape
00:17:18 are you gonna make follow up videos
00:17:20 is it gonna be like a series
00:17:22 if there's interesting things
00:17:24 to talk about I probably will
00:17:26 if I do like follow ups
00:17:28 I'll probably put them on Hippocrite
00:17:30 mostly because
00:17:32 on the off chance that
00:17:34 it blows up or is otherwise
00:17:36 just well received
00:17:38 I want it to be on the channel
00:17:40 that has monetization enabled
00:17:42 instead of the one that doesn't
00:17:44 take not have that
00:17:46 I remembered because
00:17:48 you know I made
00:17:50 9-11 jokes a couple times
00:17:52 in some videos
00:17:54 like a while ago
00:17:56 I think I may have talked about it already
00:17:58 but a while ago my channel was just like
00:18:00 super flagged saying oh you
00:18:02 your videos promote
00:18:04 terrorism
00:18:06 because you said 9-11 and you showed footage
00:18:08 in like a joke video
00:18:10 it's because you wrote in your diary
00:18:12 we're gonna shoot up the school that one time
00:18:16 they heard about your principal
00:18:18 called YouTube and said this kid
00:18:20 this kid's trouble
00:18:22 that's so true
00:18:24 we gotta get her on something
00:18:26 we gotta get
00:18:28 get them on the
00:18:30 the YouTube
00:18:32 9-11 jokes there
00:18:34 9-11 jokes
00:18:36 I think it's literally just because in those jokes
00:18:38 I have footage of the thing
00:18:40 happening on a green screen with a Kirby
00:18:42 plush or something
00:18:44 and they're like that's
00:18:46 that's
00:18:48 that's bad they didn't
00:18:50 think about it and now my channel
00:18:52 can't get monetized
00:18:54 and I think I repealed it
00:18:56 I said please give me money please
00:18:58 and they said no
00:19:00 I even took down the videos and they just
00:19:02 didn't do anything so
00:19:04 what's up with
00:19:06 your channel just has a black mark on it
00:19:08 I think it's just a black mark
00:19:10 and also like following up
00:19:12 it's like we'll get back to you in like
00:19:14 117,000 months
00:19:16 and it's like okay well
00:19:18 it's the give and take channel
00:19:20 I'm not missing out on that much
00:19:22 revenue so fuck it
00:19:24 I don't wanna bother
00:19:26 so if any future
00:19:28 RuneScape videos I make will go on Hippocrite
00:19:30 cause that's the video game channel anyway
00:19:34 and uh yeah
00:19:36 I don't know how I would make a series of it
00:19:38 Hippocrite's back baby
00:19:40 no no it is just an illusion
00:19:42 the ppt is back
00:19:44 I'm making a video you made a video
00:19:46 it's just like it's just like old times
00:19:48 it's just like old times
00:19:50 you were you were so known
00:19:52 for your video making
00:19:54 I mean
00:19:56 I mean I mean you say
00:19:58 you say that like a joke and yet I am almost
00:20:00 certainly better known for the videos that I made
00:20:02 than anything else
00:20:04 when I think of like classic like oh
00:20:06 the horseshoe crew and everyone in it
00:20:08 um you were like
00:20:10 the art guy of tbap
00:20:12 as well as the co-host
00:20:14 Nate was the edit guy of tbap
00:20:16 and then Nate went on to make videos
00:20:18 before you did
00:20:20 so I was always like oh Ben was the art guy
00:20:22 yeah I mean that's how I
00:20:24 kinda see myself
00:20:26 but uh I mean
00:20:28 I told you that the reason why I was
00:20:30 the reason why I resolved
00:20:32 that I should make another video
00:20:34 make another video
00:20:36 and show us what you got
00:20:38 remember that
00:20:40 you don't remember the cutie mark
00:20:42 kerfuffle episode 2
00:20:44 oh well I don't remember
00:20:46 that line from it
00:20:48 that's when
00:20:50 keg standard pushes give and take out
00:20:52 onto the dance floor
00:20:54 oh
00:20:56 no no
00:20:58 no it's not that
00:21:00 I remember that happening
00:21:02 he pushes anypony
00:21:04 in front of his computer
00:21:06 to make a shitty react video
00:21:08 oh yeah that's why I don't remember
00:21:10 because I don't care
00:21:12 oh yeah okay
00:21:14 make another video
00:21:16 okay
00:21:18 no no no no no
00:21:20 it's when
00:21:22 you say make another video
00:21:24 and show us what you got
00:21:26 and then it becomes a give and take video
00:21:28 and then the head pops out
00:21:30 of the edge of the screen
00:21:32 and goes like
00:21:34 hi everybody
00:21:36 it's me I'm back
00:21:38 I'm back and better than ever
00:21:40 oh my god it's so
00:21:42 the fans wanted it so much
00:21:44 and then the rest of us
00:21:46 all pop out from the sides and we go
00:21:48 Gibbon and you go ah god
00:21:50 yeah
00:21:52 I remember that bit
00:21:54 oh jesus christ
00:21:56 yeah
00:21:58 you don't know why you're there
00:22:00 but we really want you to continue
00:22:02 okay
00:22:04 that was a
00:22:06 how did I get on that
00:22:08 subject?
00:22:10 the reason why
00:22:12 I was
00:22:14 inspired to resolve to make a video
00:22:16 was because Maryweather
00:22:18 messaged me to tell me that he thought
00:22:20 that I should make more videos because he likes my other ones
00:22:22 and I said
00:22:24 well that's it
00:22:26 okay
00:22:28 this guy
00:22:30 I'll listen to Maryweather
00:22:32 Maryweather is no fool
00:22:38 I'm almost done
00:22:40 with my mirror
00:22:44 yes it's all coming together
00:22:50 oh god
00:22:52 what are you doing?
00:22:54 you're wrapping tinfoil around
00:22:56 like
00:22:58 stabbing it onto a cork board
00:23:00 no I'm just wrapping
00:23:02 I'm wrapping it around the edges
00:23:04 you know what I'll take a picture
00:23:06 it's complete
00:23:08 it's done
00:23:10 let me take a picture of a mirror
00:23:12 post-selfie
00:23:14 it's not a clear image
00:23:16 but you can kind of see my skin tone
00:23:18 reflected in it
00:23:20 that's disgusting
00:23:22 and you know what I feel about my skin tone
00:23:24 you know how I feel about my skin tone
00:23:30 we don't want to get my fucking
00:23:32 oh there's a
00:23:34 a secret prop that would give away the
00:23:36 video was almost in the
00:23:38 shot
00:23:40 that's fucking scary
00:23:42 you can see
00:23:44 actually this is funny
00:23:46 in
00:23:48 the in the shot
00:23:50 which I'm going to post in just a second
00:23:52 in the mirror
00:23:54 you can see some green reflected
00:23:56 and that's the
00:23:58 that's the jug of slime
00:24:00 that I made
00:24:02 that's my leftover slime
00:24:04 from when I made those bottles
00:24:06 for the rfck people
00:24:08 it's
00:24:10 in a jug and it's sitting on my
00:24:12 bookcase here which I put
00:24:14 in the middle of my room to stand
00:24:16 the light on because I didn't want it shining on me from the floor
00:24:18 I wanted it at
00:24:20 middle height
00:24:22 um
00:24:24 post in general
00:24:26 oh yeah
00:24:28 a rectangle
00:24:30 oh it's a rectangle alright
00:24:32 is that harmonica in the bottom right?
00:24:36 harmonica?
00:24:38 oh that's the role of aluminum foil
00:24:40 that is empty
00:24:42 oh this is a lot bigger than I thought
00:24:44 glancing at it yes
00:24:46 it's probably like 2 feet by
00:24:48 3 or 4 feet
00:24:50 alright you got a mirror
00:24:52 no I've got a mirror
00:24:54 oh my god I can't see your reflection are you a vampire
00:24:58 you a vampire or something
00:25:00 oh no I gave it away the video
00:25:02 it's a video where I show that I'm a vampire now
00:25:04 proof that I'm a vampire
00:25:08 I'm getting into
00:25:10 the occult
00:25:12 and the conspiracies
00:25:14 and magic and shit
00:25:16 startin
00:25:18 ever since I became a vampire I just find
00:25:20 stuff so interesting
00:25:22 so fascinating
00:25:24 you're really playing with fire
00:25:26 filming during the day
00:25:28 yeah I gotta use that
00:25:30 sunlight for visibility but if even a little bit
00:25:32 of it directly shines on me I will be obliterated
00:25:36 this is why vampires can't make videos
00:25:38 this is my dedication
00:25:40 do vampires
00:25:42 not show up on film
00:25:44 is that a
00:25:46 I think that might be a thing with them
00:25:48 actually
00:25:50 it's always a question
00:25:52 because like
00:25:54 obviously when vampire mythology was created
00:25:56 mirrors were the only way
00:25:58 you could do such a thing
00:26:00 you could draw a picture of them
00:26:02 yeah
00:26:04 but like
00:26:06 there was no such thing as film
00:26:08 but
00:26:10 I think
00:26:12 since you can see a vampire physically
00:26:14 when you're looking at them
00:26:16 I would say that a camera would be able to take a picture
00:26:18 of a
00:26:20 of a vampire
00:26:22 but by that logic a mirror should be able
00:26:24 to see it because it's just light reflecting off
00:26:26 the mirror
00:26:28 mirror special
00:26:30 mirror special
00:26:32 it's the silver
00:26:34 wait but no
00:26:36 it's like silver oxide
00:26:38 is what is the
00:26:40 the compound
00:26:42 so you can't take it black and white
00:26:44 but you can't take a polaroid because it's a different chemical
00:26:46 if you do it
00:26:48 DSLR
00:26:50 single lens reflex is where they have the mirror
00:26:52 come out of the way
00:26:54 you can look through the viewfinder
00:26:56 you see nothing you take a picture
00:26:58 there was a vampire there
00:27:00 because you're looking
00:27:02 what you're seeing through the viewfinder is
00:27:04 the mirrored version
00:27:06 and then the mirror slides out the way to take the picture
00:27:10 that would be a cool scene
00:27:12 fascinating
00:27:14 it would be a cool movie if that happened
00:27:16 and then the whole movie is explaining
00:27:18 how that worked
00:27:20 and why
00:27:22 alright my mirror is done
00:27:24 I'm gonna put it over here on the side
00:27:26 lean it against the wall until such time
00:27:28 that's
00:27:30 that's good
00:27:32 that's exciting I wonder if that will help
00:27:34 achieve a
00:27:36 one issue is that
00:27:38 the
00:27:40 the shot is a bit
00:27:42 brighter on the side
00:27:44 with the window
00:27:46 and I
00:27:48 wasn't able to completely
00:27:50 fix that unfortunately
00:27:52 maybe this will help
00:27:54 hmm
00:27:56 well
00:27:58 that's what I've been doing
00:28:00 I just woke up
00:28:02 well not just woke up
00:28:04 I went on a dog walk
00:28:06 I came back
00:28:08 and I did my morning workout routine
00:28:10 I had breakfast
00:28:12 and I had a shower
00:28:14 and then I'm immediately podcasting
00:28:16 so it's a pretty
00:28:18 productive morning for me
00:28:20 yeah
00:28:22 my breakfast today
00:28:24 is
00:28:26 a box of almond milk
00:28:28 I'm trying to drink
00:28:30 every fluid
00:28:32 that I have in bottles and stuff
00:28:34 to maximize pee
00:28:36 to
00:28:38 so that I don't have to move it
00:28:40 in boxes and stuff
00:28:42 you know what I just finished the first
00:28:44 I'm gonna crack open another one
00:28:46 I'm gonna crack open another
00:28:48 almond milk right
00:28:50 you just you're gonna store your almond milk
00:28:52 in your stomach sack
00:28:54 sorry actually
00:28:56 this is not almond milk
00:28:58 this is an almond non-dairy beverage
00:29:00 from Kirkland
00:29:02 what the hell does that mean
00:29:04 I don't know
00:29:06 but it doesn't go bad
00:29:08 it doesn't expire
00:29:10 I found this out the hard way
00:29:12 almond milk will expire
00:29:14 whatever the hell this stuff is
00:29:16 as long as you don't open it
00:29:18 as long as it's sealed
00:29:20 it keeps forever
00:29:22 why does almonds make milk
00:29:24 I understand why mammals make milk
00:29:26 because it's like a protein thing
00:29:28 for a baby to easily
00:29:30 ingest
00:29:32 and almonds
00:29:34 but like why are they dairy
00:29:36 if they how do they expire why is it milk
00:29:40 is this a real question
00:29:42 I don't know I've never looked into what almond milk is
00:29:44 I just assume you squeeze the almond
00:29:46 and milk comes out
00:29:48 do you think that like the almond lactates
00:29:50 and that's where the almond milk comes from
00:29:52 I don't assume it has breasts
00:29:54 I just assume like why is there
00:29:56 milk inside like a coconut
00:29:58 like what is going on
00:30:00 a very funny
00:30:02 a very funny
00:30:04 thing to even wonder about
00:30:06 honestly
00:30:08 they make almond milk they just soak the almonds
00:30:10 in water and it leeches
00:30:12 out some nutrients
00:30:14 and that makes the almond milk
00:30:16 okay why does it go bad though
00:30:18 I don't know
00:30:20 because it's freaking
00:30:22 I don't know
00:30:24 it's got fat in it
00:30:26 it's got fat in it that would go rancid
00:30:28 I see
00:30:30 yeah
00:30:32 you know they had almond milk in the middle ages
00:30:34 like medieval people drank almond milk
00:30:40 how about that
00:30:42 you think about it as some alternative milks
00:30:44 new age soy
00:30:46 soy
00:30:48 but no
00:30:50 they had almond milk in
00:30:52 I know this from Max Miller's Tasting History
00:30:56 and I don't know it because I am stupid
00:30:58 that's right
00:31:00 that's right Gib
00:31:04 okay
00:31:06 almonds with tits
00:31:08 that's the new craze on the old
00:31:10 on the old art world
00:31:12 I liked your theory better
00:31:14 I never thought about it before
00:31:16 but when I was thinking
00:31:18 are they like tiny coconuts
00:31:20 is there milk inside
00:31:22 I understand not knowing
00:31:24 how almond milk is made
00:31:26 it's just funny to be like
00:31:28 wait
00:31:30 I know mammals make milk
00:31:32 but why do almonds make milk
00:31:34 not what is almond milk
00:31:36 made of where does it come from
00:31:38 how is it made but why do almonds make milk
00:31:40 as though it is a natural
00:31:42 thing that the almond does
00:31:46 that's what I think of milk
00:31:48 it's not like you soak a cow
00:31:50 in water to make milk
00:31:52 that's true
00:31:54 but you know coconut milk
00:31:56 you just crack open the coconut and it comes out
00:31:58 so it's more akin to that
00:32:00 it's more like blood
00:32:02 it's more like almond blood honestly
00:32:04 but we don't say that
00:32:06 for marketing reasons
00:32:08 almond blood would be cooler
00:32:12 I think also
00:32:14 what confused me
00:32:16 is that milk-ing is like a verb
00:32:18 you probably milk an almond
00:32:20 so it's like
00:32:22 you soak an almond
00:32:24 almond like
00:32:26 liquid residue
00:32:28 almond juice
00:32:30 would be
00:32:32 well you don't juice it either
00:32:34 you don't exactly juice it
00:32:36 almond runoff
00:32:38 it's almond runoff
00:32:40 it's more like a tea
00:32:42 it's more like a tea
00:32:44 almond stew
00:32:46 I'm gonna try
00:32:48 I have a number of verbal tics
00:32:50 that I want to avoid
00:32:52 when filming today
00:32:54 and one of them is
00:32:56 I don't want to not say um
00:32:58 I want to not say like
00:33:00 I want to not say um
00:33:02 I want to not go
00:33:04 after I laugh which I always do and I hate that
00:33:06 you go what after you laugh
00:33:08 what after you laugh
00:33:10 did you not
00:33:12 like I suck in air through my teeth
00:33:14 I don't know listen for it
00:33:16 I remember you talking about that before
00:33:18 I did talk about how much I hate it
00:33:20 yeah I just have
00:33:22 just make sure to blow instead of suck
00:33:24 I suck in air through my teeth
00:33:26 in an audible way
00:33:28 but um
00:33:30 like pausing and saying um
00:33:32 and ah is like the worst
00:33:34 and like like like
00:33:36 I should really avoid those
00:33:38 I mean I cannot
00:33:40 to some extent I can edit them out
00:33:42 later um
00:33:44 but
00:33:46 if they're all through
00:33:48 if they're peppered all through my speech then that's bad
00:33:50 you might have to do multiple tics then
00:33:52 because it's so natural
00:33:54 I think it's um
00:33:56 the
00:33:58 like uh
00:34:00 um
00:34:02 uh
00:34:04 or
00:34:06 beep boop
00:34:08 you're making space for yourself to think of the next word
00:34:10 so like if you have a sentence
00:34:12 in your brain
00:34:14 uh you can say it
00:34:16 yeah
00:34:18 uh I can I can I can always
00:34:20 just pause and think what am I going to say next
00:34:22 and then formulate
00:34:24 that and then say it and then edit out
00:34:26 the pause
00:34:28 uh
00:34:30 that's true that's true
00:34:32 um I want to
00:34:34 yeah
00:34:36 I want to sound a little more
00:34:38 considered
00:34:40 I don't want to sound completely like off the cuff
00:34:42 I don't have a script
00:34:44 but I do have notes
00:34:46 that I'm going to be referring to
00:34:48 I think I feel like I'm going into too much detail
00:34:50 you know what
00:34:52 uh nevermind
00:34:54 I don't want to talk about this anymore
00:34:56 people are going to guess what it is
00:34:58 I've got a small
00:35:00 story it's called
00:35:02 I forgot my steam
00:35:04 password and it sucks
00:35:06 hmm
00:35:08 but then I remembered it but here's the story
00:35:10 that was a great story
00:35:12 the story goes I forgot
00:35:14 my steam password I'm like okay
00:35:16 I do the steam recovery like oh I
00:35:18 can't remember my password
00:35:20 put in your email and
00:35:22 we'll send you an email about it
00:35:24 but first do this
00:35:26 capture
00:35:28 it says click on fire hydrants
00:35:30 I click all of them
00:35:32 I guess I missed one I click
00:35:34 the crosswalks I click the traffic lights
00:35:36 I click the buses
00:35:38 it just keeps giving me captures
00:35:40 and after I've done like eight
00:35:42 it says invalid response
00:35:44 you redo the capture
00:35:46 yeah
00:35:48 so I do another eight captures
00:35:50 and I do it again
00:35:52 I make sure to not make any mistakes
00:35:54 and it's not right
00:35:56 again
00:35:58 and then I do it again and again
00:36:00 and then I'm like you've done too many captures wrong
00:36:02 you're probably a robot
00:36:04 try again tomorrow try again later
00:36:06 and so I couldn't
00:36:08 I couldn't play my game
00:36:10 I couldn't play my games
00:36:12 and the capture
00:36:14 system is fucked
00:36:16 and I was like okay there's something
00:36:18 definitely wrong you failed the reverse
00:36:20 turning test I did
00:36:22 there's something wrong
00:36:24 I realized like
00:36:26 there was no reason it didn't work
00:36:28 there was no reason on my end that it didn't work
00:36:30 it just wasn't going through
00:36:32 and so I tried different browsers
00:36:34 for this capture thing
00:36:36 no browsers worked
00:36:38 I tried looking up like
00:36:40 what the fuck
00:36:42 what do I do about this
00:36:44 and the
00:36:46 you have a problem with capture so you go on google
00:36:48 and you type in what the fuck
00:36:50 what the fuck
00:36:52 well they're watching me at all times
00:36:54 they know what's going on
00:36:56 they probably do yeah
00:36:58 so
00:37:00 I look and there are like tutorials
00:37:02 like oh steen giving you this problem
00:37:04 from like
00:37:06 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021
00:37:08 2022
00:37:10 this problem is still around
00:37:12 capture just sometimes doesn't work
00:37:14 and
00:37:16 there is no solution that
00:37:18 worked
00:37:20 okay there's no solution
00:37:22 I guess I have to go to steam
00:37:24 some other way and like ask them
00:37:26 for help but they don't have
00:37:28 customer support for steam
00:37:30 you go to their thing and it's like
00:37:32 okay I need help getting my account back
00:37:34 and they send me to the same page
00:37:36 where it's like input your email address
00:37:38 or your phone number and
00:37:40 do this capture and that's where it all breaks down
00:37:42 so I was like okay
00:37:44 I guess I gotta go to
00:37:46 twitter and at
00:37:48 steam hoping that they would respond
00:37:50 but like it's steam
00:37:52 it's valve they're not gonna fucking say anything
00:37:54 I did make a tweet
00:37:56 but then I remembered my password and I got in
00:37:58 so it's like
00:38:00 all for nothing
00:38:02 well I mean what it does
00:38:04 tell me is that if I do forget my password
00:38:06 there's no way I can
00:38:08 there's nothing I could do if I could call
00:38:10 a number if I could email somebody
00:38:12 that'd be something but if the
00:38:14 capture doesn't work and there's no way
00:38:16 for the capture to work
00:38:18 well I will forever be
00:38:20 locked out of my steam account and I don't know how
00:38:22 what about would do anything about it
00:38:24 what about some sort of do you have like
00:38:26 two factor authentication with like Authy
00:38:28 or something I do but like it
00:38:30 asked me to like if I want to
00:38:32 change my password I need to do the capture
00:38:34 hmm
00:38:36 I couldn't figure it out
00:38:38 maybe there's a way to do it
00:38:40 but it sucks because
00:38:42 so wait I don't understand
00:38:44 why did the captures fail
00:38:46 I don't know I did the capture
00:38:48 like it comes up with a little white box
00:38:50 so click on these things until there's
00:38:52 none left and then you say
00:38:54 next and then you do it again
00:38:56 a few times and then it's like
00:38:58 okay then the box disappears
00:39:00 and then on the page
00:39:02 where it says like I'm not
00:39:04 a robot and like
00:39:06 all that an error message comes up
00:39:08 saying you did not
00:39:10 the capture could not be completed
00:39:12 there's like a string of
00:39:14 like numbers and letters
00:39:16 like here's the ID
00:39:18 for this error
00:39:20 but it's a different every time so it's like
00:39:22 an individual case thing
00:39:24 um
00:39:26 I would have taken a picture of it
00:39:28 but I forgot
00:39:30 if it ever happens again
00:39:32 I will
00:39:34 scream about it
00:39:36 I've done the capture and I've seen
00:39:38 um
00:39:40 fire hydrants, traffic lights
00:39:42 crosswalks
00:39:44 pick out the bus
00:39:46 pick out the plane
00:39:48 pick out the sea plane
00:39:50 pick out the train
00:39:52 I saw a new one
00:39:54 the other day
00:39:56 recently I've been seeing
00:39:58 it's like pick out the giraffes
00:40:00 pick out the
00:40:02 horse made of clouds
00:40:04 was one
00:40:06 pick out the
00:40:08 horse facing right or horse facing left
00:40:10 uh
00:40:12 and then the creepiest one that I
00:40:14 really hate is pick out the lion
00:40:16 with its eyes open or the lions
00:40:18 with its eyes closed
00:40:20 and those are creepy because
00:40:22 the images that they show like they show lions
00:40:24 but
00:40:26 I think a lot of them are like they've been
00:40:28 digitally altered to have the lions
00:40:30 eyes like appear open or closed
00:40:32 and like they look weird they look almost
00:40:34 like their eyes have been sewn shut sometimes
00:40:36 these uncanny pictures of lions
00:40:38 uh
00:40:40 and I'm not a fan of them
00:40:42 why does AI need to know
00:40:44 whether a lion has its eyes open or not
00:40:46 what are they doing over there
00:40:48 because it's something that a robot
00:40:50 is bad at
00:40:52 identifying
00:40:54 in theory
00:40:56 but like I understand the road stuff
00:40:58 is like practical oh we can use all that data
00:41:00 from all the billions of people
00:41:02 finishing captures we collect that data
00:41:04 we can say okay robot
00:41:06 this is what a fire hydrant looks like
00:41:08 uh the humans have verified it
00:41:10 and the human the robot will be like
00:41:12 okay now I know what that looks like
00:41:14 I can drive a car now
00:41:16 but like what is the lion for
00:41:18 I know
00:41:20 I know how to like stare down a lion now
00:41:22 what what what purpose
00:41:24 wait a minute is that
00:41:26 is that why it's like fire hydrants
00:41:28 traffic lights crosswalks
00:41:30 it's to train AI to drive
00:41:32 it's to train AI to understand
00:41:34 and recognize things on the road
00:41:36 so it doesn't like drive wrong
00:41:38 and that's why the the images
00:41:40 are often like very hard to
00:41:42 determine for a robot but like like
00:41:44 they're blurry but a human can understand
00:41:46 through context like yeah that part is a crosswalk
00:41:48 wait a minute
00:41:50 okay hang on I don't understand
00:41:52 this because
00:41:54 it knows which
00:41:56 pictures are crosswalks
00:41:58 and fire hydrants like it knows
00:42:00 the answer and it knows
00:42:02 and that's it's using this to verify that
00:42:04 you are human so how is it learning
00:42:06 anything from having you pick out the answers
00:42:08 that it already knows
00:42:10 um probably because the images
00:42:12 were like screened
00:42:14 by a human first before they go into the
00:42:16 machine then it already
00:42:18 knows no no no I mean like
00:42:20 a person says okay this is
00:42:22 well
00:42:24 you know I've heard
00:42:26 that that is the why it does that
00:42:28 I don't know how it works that way
00:42:30 maybe maybe like cross
00:42:32 like maybe it's like a
00:42:34 like a um
00:42:36 the majority of people say this
00:42:38 therefore that's the correct
00:42:40 one
00:42:42 like it it calculates based on
00:42:44 all the inputs
00:42:46 I suppose maybe
00:42:48 something yeah it could be
00:42:50 it could be something like that
00:42:52 like there's it doesn't like it only
00:42:54 it decides what's a fire hydrant based
00:42:56 on consensus yeah that might be
00:42:58 true
00:43:00 that doesn't explain how
00:43:02 like the first person who sees
00:43:04 a capture
00:43:06 did they just get to decide
00:43:08 like they click
00:43:10 like nobody's clicked on this capture before
00:43:12 this person clicks on
00:43:14 this it says it's a fire hydrant
00:43:16 the computer doesn't have any other data
00:43:18 to cross reference it with to know
00:43:20 whether that is the consensus or not so it just says
00:43:22 yeah you're right yeah there would
00:43:24 either have to be one guy or some guy
00:43:26 who is picking out the images
00:43:28 in the first place and being like this is
00:43:30 a picture of a fire hydrant
00:43:32 or there would it would have to be
00:43:34 showing you images
00:43:36 that might have fire hydrants in them
00:43:38 and then letting like internet
00:43:40 consensus builds
00:43:42 the consensus about where they the fire hydrant
00:43:44 is
00:43:46 maybe it's like a computer
00:43:48 in like a self-driving car
00:43:50 is taking pictures and sending them off
00:43:52 like I don't know exactly
00:43:54 what this is can we verify it with humans
00:43:56 okay like this is
00:43:58 a traffic light
00:44:00 it's like the car is approaching a crosswalk
00:44:02 and there are kids walking across the crosswalk
00:44:04 and as it's driving it's like
00:44:06 hmm take a picture send it off to capture
00:44:08 I need to verify whether there are kids and I need
00:44:10 to swerve
00:44:12 I need to know right now
00:44:14 it's doing 70
00:44:16 or super computer
00:44:18 hang on
00:44:20 waiting for a consensus
00:44:22 waiting for a consensus to be reached
00:44:24 we just got to lock people out of their camps
00:44:26 so they do captures quick
00:44:28 make sure the capture doesn't work
00:44:30 so they can do it over and over again
00:44:32 uh
00:44:34 it doesn't work
00:44:36 the technology will never work
00:44:38 AI will never replace
00:44:40 artists
00:44:42 you know I had an idea
00:44:46 what if
00:44:48 the story of John Henry
00:44:50 but
00:44:52 it's about artists and
00:44:54 paint and art AI
00:44:56 you know
00:44:58 I don't know John Henry
00:45:00 John Henry was a
00:45:02 I think he was probably a real person
00:45:04 who has been mythologized somewhat
00:45:06 he's sort of an American folk
00:45:08 character who
00:45:10 his thing is that he was a railroad worker
00:45:12 and I guess they
00:45:14 invented a fricking machine
00:45:16 that was going to put all the railroad workers out of work
00:45:18 and he like
00:45:20 was so good at railroad
00:45:22 building that he proved that man could
00:45:24 beat the railroad machine
00:45:26 because he built better than the machine
00:45:28 I don't know whatever that's the story
00:45:30 these horses coming over here thinking they can pull our carts
00:45:32 better than I can
00:45:34 well so then
00:45:36 yeah
00:45:38 I think he died
00:45:40 I think the story is like
00:45:42 he drove those railroad sparks
00:45:44 so hard that yeah he beat the machine
00:45:46 but he fucking died doing it
00:45:48 but he proved something
00:45:50 god damn it
00:45:52 he proved that
00:45:54 if you grow a human for so many years
00:45:56 and then they die after one attempt
00:45:58 they can beat a robot but it's not very good
00:46:00 not very
00:46:02 sustainable
00:46:08 according to legend John Henry's prowess
00:46:10 as a steel driver was measured in a race
00:46:12 against a steam powered
00:46:14 rock drilling machine
00:46:16 a race that he won only to die in victory
00:46:18 with hammer in hand as his heart gave out from stress
00:46:20 okay
00:46:22 that's really just saying the robot
00:46:24 wins because it did die
00:46:26 I think the idea there
00:46:28 is not so much that
00:46:30 like oh he proved that man is
00:46:32 better than machine
00:46:34 it's not so much an applejack
00:46:36 at the end of the super speedy
00:46:38 cider squeezy episode I was right all along
00:46:40 you gotta make cider with love
00:46:42 you gotta drive those rail spikes with love
00:46:44 only a human can do that
00:46:46 robots don't know how to drive rail spikes
00:46:48 with love
00:46:50 it's more of just sort of mythologizing
00:46:52 or remembering
00:46:54 this guy
00:46:56 lived and died
00:46:58 history
00:47:00 the tide of progress
00:47:02 ended up making this guy irrelevant
00:47:04 but he won one
00:47:06 glorious symbolic victory
00:47:08 before he was
00:47:10 overtaken by the march of time
00:47:12 you know
00:47:14 it's not a practical victory
00:47:16 it's a
00:47:18 symbolic one
00:47:20 the whole discussion of AI art
00:47:22 it absolutely will replace
00:47:24 some kinds of artists
00:47:26 jobs
00:47:28 you can't replace art because it's like
00:47:30 an emotional
00:47:32 practice you do it because you feel good
00:47:34 or something you feel emotions
00:47:36 when you do it
00:47:38 the capital
00:47:40 you gain from having a job in the arts
00:47:42 that might
00:47:44 be in problem
00:47:46 that's a capitalism thing though
00:47:48 we gotta destroy capitalism
00:47:50 you see
00:47:52 and then we can do all the art we want
00:47:54 and then the computers can do the advertising
00:47:56 stuff
00:47:58 they can make the movie posters
00:48:00 and the illustrations on the books
00:48:02 and then we can go in there
00:48:04 and throw in the wall with our shit
00:48:06 and then they
00:48:08 and the computers
00:48:10 can use the algorithm to
00:48:12 advertise that
00:48:14 to steal everyone's data
00:48:16 and put the ads into their minds
00:48:18 so that our art can be
00:48:20 so everyone
00:48:22 so every little twitter artist
00:48:24 can have the AI
00:48:26 can maximize the algorithm so that
00:48:28 everyone's getting blasted with art ads all the time
00:48:30 everyone gets exposure
00:48:32 exposure's free now
00:48:34 no one has to work for it anymore
00:48:36 we've decommodified exposure
00:48:38 that's
00:48:40 space communism
00:48:42 fully automated luxury space communism for me
00:48:44 anyway
00:48:46 so much exposure
00:48:48 that nobody even
00:48:50 understands or knows anything
00:48:52 no one can separate
00:48:54 noise from signal anymore
00:48:56 so there's no point
00:48:58 there was already no point
00:49:00 true
00:49:06 I really do like
00:49:08 my mid-journey
00:49:10 avatar though
00:49:12 I really do like the
00:49:14 oblivionfall made some more
00:49:16 he made some more gorgeous ben saint
00:49:18 and slime city
00:49:20 AI mid-journey
00:49:22 images and he sent them to me and they look so good
00:49:26 mid-journey really is good at certain things
00:49:28 it really does
00:49:30 yeah it's good at like making a sci-fi
00:49:32 like sci-fi
00:49:34 sci-fi landscapes fantasy land it's good at
00:49:36 painting landscapes
00:49:38 it's good at like figures
00:49:40 but not faces
00:49:42 I mean
00:49:44 I could see it on like the front
00:49:46 cover of like a thriller
00:49:48 sci-fi book
00:49:50 where there's aliens
00:49:52 and slimes
00:49:54 and it's all fucked
00:49:56 yeah the man with the hood
00:49:58 and the face but he doesn't have a face
00:50:00 it's not it's not good at
00:50:02 depicting characters
00:50:06 expressions
00:50:08 people
00:50:10 you know what I have to
00:50:12 pee do you mind if I go do that
00:50:14 I gotta this is almond milk damn it
00:50:16 you know Matt in that
00:50:18 in that one episode of tasting
00:50:20 history max miller reads a
00:50:22 excerpt from like a medieval doctor
00:50:24 who is extolling the benefits
00:50:26 of almond milk and one of the things he says
00:50:28 about it is that it provoketh urine
00:50:30 it soothes
00:50:32 the belly and provoketh urine
00:50:34 that's what it's doing for me right now
00:50:36 alright be back in one
00:50:38 sec
00:50:40 one little second
00:50:42 so for the viewers at home
00:50:44 you may if I've
00:50:46 done a bad job of editing
00:50:48 my audio you may have heard
00:50:50 my mouse clicking
00:50:52 over and over and over again
00:50:54 and that's because I'm playing RuneScape
00:50:56 right now
00:50:58 I'm covertly gaining
00:51:00 lots and lots of iron ore
00:51:02 in RuneScape by clicking on it
00:51:06 it's very quiet so hopefully it's not
00:51:08 a problem
00:51:10 I'm gonna noise remove it I'm gonna click
00:51:12 remove it before I send it over to Eleazar
00:51:14 but if it's still there
00:51:16 that's why and I don't
00:51:18 I don't
00:51:20 apologize for it
00:51:22 it's my grind
00:51:24 it's my Sigma grind
00:51:26 you must respect me
00:51:28 and my stupid stupid ways
00:51:30 I've got
00:51:32 190,000
00:51:34 experience left until I'm level
00:51:36 83 mining
00:51:38 and let's see on my bank
00:51:40 how much iron ore I have
00:51:42 I have 68,981
00:51:44 iron ore
00:51:46 are you RuneScaping
00:51:48 I'm mining
00:51:50 I'm scaping
00:51:52 are you mining and crafting
00:51:54 in RuneScape?
00:51:56 not crafting yet
00:51:58 my crafting level is 35
00:52:00 okay
00:52:02 it's gotta get higher before you craft
00:52:04 I don't think I need to do crafting
00:52:06 crafting is like
00:52:08 it's an odd skill
00:52:10 because
00:52:12 it's just sort of
00:52:14 like a bits and bobs, knickknacks
00:52:16 a skill where
00:52:18 it doesn't have any specific
00:52:20 thing it's like you can have
00:52:22 a skill like wood cutting
00:52:24 and that makes sense you cut trees down
00:52:26 and it's how good you can cut trees
00:52:28 but crafting is like
00:52:30 you can make jewelry
00:52:32 you can make leather
00:52:34 items
00:52:36 you can craft
00:52:38 bow strings
00:52:40 you can have a look
00:52:42 you can weave
00:52:44 you can make pottery
00:52:46 pottery, glass, blowing
00:52:48 and it's like
00:52:50 they're all under one
00:52:52 that's true
00:52:54 remember that character from pop culture
00:53:00 okay sorry
00:53:04 so yeah it's like all of these different things
00:53:06 so in RuneScape you could
00:53:08 spin a bunch of clay pots
00:53:10 and somehow be very very good afterwards
00:53:12 at making
00:53:14 gold jewelry for no reason
00:53:16 because you didn't actually do
00:53:18 any of jewelry before
00:53:20 it's all in the same skill
00:53:24 I see
00:53:26 sorry to change the subject
00:53:28 but I did have a thought while I was peeing
00:53:30 and that is about the video
00:53:32 and that is that
00:53:34 if it goes on really long
00:53:36 if I'm recording it and it's getting
00:53:38 really long
00:53:40 there are some natural breakpoints
00:53:42 in it that I could decide
00:53:44 this is going to have to be in parts
00:53:46 so
00:53:48 I'll end the part here
00:53:50 and that would be a pretty natural place
00:53:52 if I move in between parts
00:53:54 who cares
00:53:56 I would still make the video
00:53:58 one big video because people love
00:54:00 seeing that long number
00:54:02 that's the plan
00:54:04 you would still cut it together into one
00:54:06 I would cut it together into one big
00:54:08 video file yes
00:54:10 they could be chapters but
00:54:12 people like seeing a big chunky video
00:54:14 so
00:54:16 this is something I was wondering
00:54:18 do you think that people prefer
00:54:20 one big
00:54:22 let's just say six hour video
00:54:24 two hour part one
00:54:26 part two part three videos
00:54:28 yes because
00:54:30 much less clicking is involved
00:54:32 and
00:54:34 the
00:54:36 if they want to rewatch it
00:54:38 they just have to do one click
00:54:40 and also it's just a fact
00:54:42 that part one of anything
00:54:44 will have more views than part two or three
00:54:46 that's
00:54:48 true the click through rate
00:54:50 that is true
00:54:52 so you might as well just put them all together
00:54:54 I think you're probably right
00:54:56 I guess the one thing
00:54:58 that's scary about that
00:55:00 is that like should the video ever become
00:55:02 flagged
00:55:04 or like be
00:55:06 decided that it violates something
00:55:08 it would be the whole thing would go
00:55:10 instead of just a part of it
00:55:12 but like
00:55:14 I mean flagged in what way
00:55:16 I don't know
00:55:18 like copyright I think there's ways you can cut
00:55:20 little bits out like audio
00:55:22 or like a tiny scene
00:55:24 that I don't know
00:55:26 I mean that's probably not going to be in
00:55:28 YouTube but it's not the best
00:55:30 better than it used to be
00:55:32 yeah
00:55:34 you know I've been noticing
00:55:36 stock
00:55:38 YouTube music
00:55:40 a lot
00:55:42 recently
00:55:44 just the first example
00:55:46 that comes to my head is like
00:55:48 the sad music that plays sometimes
00:55:50 in
00:55:52 the action button reviews
00:55:54 I've heard I've started hearing it in other
00:55:56 places and I think
00:55:58 it's like YouTube stock music
00:56:00 and that's
00:56:02 weird
00:56:04 I guess I had assumed that it was
00:56:06 a bespoke sort of like
00:56:08 picked out specifically
00:56:10 for this video but no
00:56:12 it's just what YouTube tells you
00:56:14 to use
00:56:16 yeah it is always a bit weird when
00:56:18 like one YouTube creator
00:56:20 has their intro music being this
00:56:22 song and you're like oh yeah
00:56:24 it's that creator and then
00:56:26 anyone can use it it's royalty free
00:56:28 it's a fucking Kevin MacLeod
00:56:30 it's like
00:56:32 that's the summoning salt videos
00:56:34 right there's like the Kevin
00:56:36 I think the summoning the iconic summoning
00:56:38 salt song is just a default
00:56:40 YouTube song
00:56:42 I don't know that that's
00:56:44 the case I feel like it's like a video
00:56:46 a song that's on
00:56:48 YouTube
00:56:50 maybe it's also part of the YouTube because like when you do
00:56:52 like
00:56:54 a library that you can access
00:56:56 through YouTube that they say
00:56:58 oh here's a bunch of things you can download and use
00:57:00 yeah and like the benefit
00:57:02 the benefit of that is that all the stuff that's
00:57:04 on there is stuff you know won't get flag
00:57:06 yeah
00:57:08 which is good which is like a big deal and pretty good
00:57:10 honestly
00:57:12 I can never be able to go
00:57:14 through that and like find anything
00:57:16 I just use like
00:57:18 very quiet video game soundtrack still
00:57:20 I totally understand
00:57:22 why that's useful and
00:57:24 and it makes perfect
00:57:26 sense however
00:57:28 when I the the sad music
00:57:30 from action button when I when I heard that somewhere
00:57:32 else and I realized that it was not
00:57:34 a like really
00:57:36 a personal choice
00:57:38 I it retroactively
00:57:40 was like cheap and I was like oh
00:57:42 he just picked it from a list and that's lame
00:57:44 thought it
00:57:46 was pretty effective in context but now
00:57:48 now I hate it
00:57:50 I feel less
00:57:52 I feel less about it
00:57:54 it's I don't know where that
00:57:56 royalty free music is from there's lots of
00:57:58 places you can get royalty free music
00:58:00 that work on YouTube that aren't from
00:58:02 YouTube
00:58:04 and
00:58:06 like
00:58:08 like red litter media huff in the bag
00:58:10 all those songs they use for that
00:58:12 you can find them there are playlists
00:58:14 people have found have made of like oh
00:58:16 this is the
00:58:18 little piano bit with the
00:58:20 huff in the bag
00:58:22 skit stuff
00:58:24 they use that all the time
00:58:26 but because it's like a relatively obscure
00:58:28 royalty free music
00:58:30 channel or whatever people don't tend to
00:58:32 find that when they're looking for royalty
00:58:34 free stuff
00:58:36 you can have a bit of an identity
00:58:38 as long as you're looking as long as
00:58:40 you're searching for something
00:58:42 you haven't heard before
00:58:44 no I think I do think that
00:58:46 the summoning salt one is just a default
00:58:48 but I mean he nevertheless
00:58:50 sort of made it his iconic
00:58:52 track
00:58:54 it's irrevocably linked
00:58:56 in people's minds with summoning salt
00:59:00 I guess there's room
00:59:02 for inspired choices
00:59:04 I guess
00:59:06 something I'm always
00:59:08 impressed when I
00:59:10 am watching a YouTube video and there's music
00:59:12 and at some point either they say it
00:59:14 or I realize by reading the description
00:59:16 like oh this guy made their own music
00:59:18 like the background
00:59:20 for this guy's videos
00:59:22 is like he's also a
00:59:24 musician and he made all his own
00:59:26 oh yeah like
00:59:28 Geo wizards the straight line
00:59:30 mission guy
00:59:32 all that 8 bit or
00:59:34 Commodore 64 sound and music
00:59:36 he made it himself
00:59:38 it's like wow cool
00:59:40 so iconic
00:59:42 yeah
00:59:44 a skill that I don't have and so I respect
00:59:46 it
00:59:48 I always thought I could make music but
00:59:50 like
00:59:52 I'm not like
00:59:54 I'm mostly good at guitar
00:59:56 and I don't really know how to like make a
00:59:58 whole big song
01:00:00 so I would do like acoustic guitar things
01:00:02 and I could do that but it's like
01:00:04 acoustic guitar is a certain
01:00:06 vibe you can't use it just
01:00:08 anywhere
01:00:10 you know I tried to make
01:00:12 I made a contest entry for the
01:00:14 um
01:00:16 that Homestuck music contest
01:00:18 um
01:00:20 the one that ended up being
01:00:22 it was like the troll
01:00:24 and all an ancestor
01:00:26 themed it was like two
01:00:28 two CDs
01:00:30 and each one had like each
01:00:32 one CD had a track for every troll
01:00:34 and then the other CD had a track for every
01:00:36 ancestor
01:00:38 that ended up being
01:00:40 but I made a track
01:00:42 as a contest entry for that contest
01:00:44 didn't win obviously didn't get into
01:00:46 the CD
01:00:48 how'd you make it
01:00:50 I used um
01:00:52 it wasn't Fruity Loops
01:00:54 it was shit it was some
01:00:56 free like you know
01:00:58 track editing
01:01:00 software I made it
01:01:02 and this is I made that
01:01:04 on my laptop as I was working
01:01:06 as like the cashier
01:01:08 at an ice cream store
01:01:10 parlor
01:01:12 huh that's some Ben St.
01:01:14 Law
01:01:16 yeah I've probably never mentioned that but yeah I
01:01:18 remember making that
01:01:20 track this was probably
01:01:22 shortly after I had graduated from
01:01:24 college
01:01:26 and I was working
01:01:28 for this one summer I didn't have anything
01:01:30 to do and so I
01:01:32 my mom like
01:01:34 she saw a hiring sign
01:01:36 in this one ice cream store
01:01:38 and I was like okay whatever and I went
01:01:40 and I worked there for a few months
01:01:42 and I remember
01:01:44 I would bring my laptop to work whenever there was
01:01:46 downtime I would fuck around on my laptop
01:01:48 and one of the things I fucked around at was
01:01:50 I don't remember what
01:01:52 music software it was but it was something
01:01:54 I could get for free and it wasn't Fruity Loops
01:01:56 and
01:01:58 I don't know
01:02:00 I tried to make my track
01:02:02 because the contest
01:02:04 prompt didn't specify
01:02:06 that this was going to be about trolls
01:02:08 it said that each of the entries would be
01:02:10 themed for a character
01:02:12 like
01:02:14 I tried to pick a different character
01:02:16 I tried to pick a character that probably
01:02:18 most people wouldn't make a track for
01:02:20 so I picked Typheus
01:02:22 the Denizen
01:02:24 and so I made my track
01:02:26 if I remember it I wish I could find it
01:02:28 I don't know where it would be
01:02:30 now maybe on an old laptop
01:02:32 I guess
01:02:34 it sort of was
01:02:36 I tried to make
01:02:38 I only used wind instruments
01:02:40 or I mostly used wind instruments because
01:02:42 he's the air
01:02:44 he's the breath guy
01:02:46 I sort of made an organ
01:02:48 I started it with
01:02:50 a bombastic
01:02:52 organ intro
01:02:54 and then I think I introduced a little
01:02:56 drum beat and I introduced
01:02:58 a little
01:03:00 melody over top of that
01:03:02 the background was
01:03:04 organs
01:03:06 wind organs and I think I had pan pipes
01:03:08 I think the melody was pan pipes over
01:03:10 organs and a drum beat
01:03:12 wind themed
01:03:14 because John plays
01:03:16 because John plays the wind organ
01:03:18 the pipe organ in the palace of
01:03:20 Typheus
01:03:22 I've heard
01:03:24 there's like the
01:03:26 I think Typheus does have a track
01:03:28 somewhere
01:03:30 in one of the albums
01:03:32 yeah I feel like they made an album
01:03:34 of like the denizens
01:03:36 and there's a bunch of songs
01:03:38 fan made songs for that
01:03:40 wouldn't it be funny if it turned out it was
01:03:42 my track
01:03:44 yeah I'm wondering what if they just
01:03:46 didn't credit you or didn't contact you
01:03:48 oh this is good
01:03:50 oh I think it was the land of
01:03:52 fans and music
01:03:54 that I think
01:03:56 yeah that could be it
01:04:00 that's about the
01:04:02 medium and the planets
01:04:04 which could also be about the denizens
01:04:06 I feel like I've seen
01:04:08 songs
01:04:10 based on them somewhere
01:04:12 if you can find
01:04:14 if there is an official
01:04:16 Homestuck song
01:04:18 for Typheus
01:04:20 I would like to hear it
01:04:22 if any thoughts on whether mine was better
01:04:26 okay well I can look in my folder
01:04:28 or if any if
01:04:30 this is to the listeners
01:04:32 if a listener knows
01:04:34 what album this was on
01:04:40 oh man I always really liked the denizens
01:04:42 I like them a lot
01:04:44 they're so mysterious
01:04:46 I still don't know anything really
01:04:48 they're very
01:04:50 mysterious the way they're
01:04:54 the way they're depicted with like you can't
01:04:56 they're sort of like
01:04:58 there's a very biblical angel
01:05:00 thing about how
01:05:02 you can't look at their faces
01:05:04 like the way they're depicted as
01:05:06 like
01:05:08 their face is just
01:05:10 this light that you can't
01:05:12 look at
01:05:14 it's like you can't comprehend
01:05:16 what it really is
01:05:18 until like
01:05:20 there was a
01:05:22 there was like a flash
01:05:24 where
01:05:26 Caliborn
01:05:28 was fighting his
01:05:30 I think it was a game over or something
01:05:32 y'all the bear
01:05:34 yeah he was fighting that in like a flash
01:05:36 maybe it was
01:05:38 it was one of the things in access I can't remember
01:05:40 but for a brief moment
01:05:42 you do see a little bit of a face
01:05:44 and I'm like oh
01:05:46 well I remember
01:05:48 hmm I remember there's a big um
01:05:50 it's not a flash
01:05:52 but it's a big animated page
01:05:54 where like you see
01:05:56 the whole body
01:05:58 of it reaching up and you see like
01:06:00 the head with just this light coming out
01:06:02 and Caliborn is like standing
01:06:04 really small in front of it
01:06:06 looking up at it with his gun out
01:06:08 that's when he like first
01:06:10 enters the chamber
01:06:12 yeah I think I remember that you do
01:06:14 see a little bit of face
01:06:16 you do see a little bit it's like um
01:06:18 Caliborn in his sprite form
01:06:20 is jumping around and hitting him with a crowbar
01:06:22 and stuff and then
01:06:24 Yalla Baoth does like a big beam
01:06:26 thing and you can see it sort of like
01:06:28 screaming like
01:06:30 hmm and the the beams
01:06:32 like rotate around like it's
01:06:34 a bullet hell
01:06:36 there's there's happens for a second
01:06:38 does it look like
01:06:40 you know
01:06:42 he in like in the in the browser
01:06:44 icon and in like the statues
01:06:46 he's just sort of got a sort of problem
01:06:48 sleuth like
01:06:50 non-descript face
01:06:52 no I think it was more like
01:06:54 like the detailed
01:06:56 hmm I can't
01:06:58 remember what it looked like I remember it feeling like
01:07:00 kind of gross
01:07:02 being like oh
01:07:04 hmm
01:07:06 now I'm
01:07:08 curious I don't remember
01:07:10 it could be game over
01:07:12 it could be
01:07:14 fucking
01:07:16 the one where everybody fights
01:07:20 collide it could be that
01:07:22 does he fight Yalla Baoth
01:07:24 and collide
01:07:26 I think that maybe
01:07:28 maybe that one and maybe another one where
01:07:30 Caliborn is depicted fighting
01:07:32 for like a few seconds
01:07:34 hmm and then it
01:07:36 goes back to whatever else is happening
01:07:40 I
01:07:42 this is just reminds me
01:07:44 how
01:07:46 disappointing it is
01:07:48 that like the actual like game
01:07:50 of spurb and like all the mythology
01:07:52 around it gets like so little
01:07:54 attention at the end of the game
01:07:56 or it's like towards the end of home
01:07:58 suck yeah
01:08:00 it's my favorite shit
01:08:02 and it's just it's just not
01:08:04 the priority
01:08:06 oh
01:08:08 oh you see
01:08:10 I think I see it
01:08:12 oh yeah it sucks
01:08:14 okay is this it
01:08:16 um
01:08:18 yeah
01:08:20 if this is it
01:08:22 I think this is it and it's bad
01:08:24 oh my god
01:08:26 yeah I saw that
01:08:28 what a head in my head
01:08:30 that blue bit wasn't there
01:08:32 I think it's mostly just the white
01:08:34 the black lines drawn
01:08:36 I guess it's a little bit
01:08:38 blue lit is like it flies
01:08:40 off really quick but yeah that's the face
01:08:42 I guess it's a little bit
01:08:44 it's it's like um
01:08:46 what do you call him what's the bad guy
01:08:48 from problem sleuth
01:08:50 mobster kingpin
01:08:52 mobster kingpin I think it's
01:08:54 meant to resemble that and like yeah
01:08:56 I right yeah
01:08:58 it's got a bit too much detail
01:09:00 it looks like a snake because it's a snake
01:09:02 it's just sort of makes it more
01:09:04 of a beast and less of a cool
01:09:06 like um
01:09:08 yeah like cool
01:09:10 I don't know magical
01:09:12 undecipherable energy
01:09:14 being much much cooler
01:09:16 when you didn't
01:09:18 know
01:09:20 you know what this looks like it looks like that
01:09:22 that fucking rick and morty joke
01:09:24 where the sun
01:09:26 is screaming all the time
01:09:28 oh yeah they go to a planet
01:09:30 and it's like oh this is great and then
01:09:32 the sun rises and it screams
01:09:34 yeah
01:09:36 you are right it does look like that
01:09:38 it's silly it makes me
01:09:40 I think it's meant to be silly
01:09:42 I think it
01:09:44 I think it's meant to be
01:09:46 dumb but I just
01:09:48 think it's a bad choice
01:09:50 I don't know if it's meant to be dumb because
01:09:52 like in the moment it's like a really hype
01:09:54 like oh Caliburn's fighting everyone's fighting
01:09:56 so much stuff is happening and it's like
01:09:58 I could imagine somebody
01:10:00 who just doesn't understand the importance
01:10:02 of mystery being like
01:10:04 oh but we've never seen like the face
01:10:06 of one of these guys
01:10:08 maybe this would be a good time
01:10:10 we could see the face at last
01:10:12 and now we can put that in a wiki
01:10:14 and now everybody knows how many teeth they
01:10:16 have
01:10:18 the tone of collide is
01:10:20 kind of comical though
01:10:22 so I think this face
01:10:24 is meant to be
01:10:26 a little bit goofy
01:10:28 I would make it goofier
01:10:30 I
01:10:34 if I was gonna do that
01:10:36 I would make it as goofy as a problem
01:10:38 sleuth face
01:10:40 oh I see yeah
01:10:42 yeah I
01:10:44 I think I
01:10:46 I'm pretty sure this is a mobster kingpin reference
01:10:48 which I get it
01:10:50 I get
01:10:52 the desire to do that
01:10:54 with your final boss monsters so you use
01:10:56 a callback to the other big
01:10:58 final boss monster from the other story
01:11:00 I get it
01:11:02 I get it but
01:11:04 it's bad for Yalda Bea
01:11:08 it's a very
01:11:10 it's if
01:11:12 the denizens... Yalda Gaoth
01:11:14 more like Yalda Gaoth
01:11:16 the denizens had so much like build up
01:11:18 and then like
01:11:20 I don't know if you're gonna like
01:11:22 subvert their build up by having them look
01:11:24 goofy yeah I think
01:11:26 to have it be like such a
01:11:28 fleeting throwaway moment
01:11:30 in the course of this one
01:11:34 it's very
01:11:36 if they wanted to reveal the face
01:11:38 if they wanted to really reveal the face
01:11:40 for some reason
01:11:42 it should be like a huge
01:11:44 impressive panel
01:11:46 it should be
01:11:50 it should be a
01:11:52 it should have been a moment
01:11:54 not a thing you could literally like
01:11:56 miss and not even notice
01:11:58 because it's like every depiction has been like
01:12:00 we don't see what's really
01:12:02 going on in the interaction between
01:12:04 the denizen and the kid
01:12:06 yeah
01:12:08 and earlier on we only hear about
01:12:10 what happens and you know John dies
01:12:12 because he goes to see Tytheus
01:12:14 mm-hmm
01:12:16 and we don't see any of that interaction
01:12:18 so fucking cool who know what what happened
01:12:20 why what was it like nobody
01:12:22 John doesn't remember because the version of him
01:12:24 that lived didn't do that
01:12:26 so mysterious
01:12:30 this this this this only this only takes away
01:12:32 this only takes away
01:12:34 some of the appeal I still
01:12:36 I still really like the denizens
01:12:38 I think they're a really cool element of the
01:12:40 story another another cool
01:12:42 part of spurb lore that
01:12:44 the homestuck that ladder
01:12:46 homestuck seems
01:12:48 almost obsessed with not
01:12:50 paying any attention to
01:12:52 yep yeah
01:12:54 yeah
01:12:56 but that is a conversation that has been had a billion
01:12:58 times I know I know
01:13:00 I'll never get over it
01:13:02 it's never it's never gonna be okay
01:13:06 it's never gonna be
01:13:08 okay what happens
01:13:10 well
01:13:12 uh speaking of
01:13:14 comics yeah I've been working
01:13:16 a little bit on Clarissa
01:13:18 oh um
01:13:20 there was a bit of there's a bit of a script
01:13:22 thing where I'm like I had
01:13:24 a few sketches
01:13:26 and I wanted to
01:13:28 something was off about the way
01:13:30 the story ended so I
01:13:32 I had to like go back and like rearrange
01:13:34 panels and add some new panels into
01:13:36 the sketches and do some script
01:13:38 stuff so that's
01:13:40 that's something not a lot yet
01:13:42 I'm not like really sitting down and like
01:13:44 okay
01:13:46 let's go let's draw
01:13:48 it's a lot of thinking and being like how do I
01:13:50 make the story like so
01:13:52 okay like
01:13:54 not bad this is what I'm
01:13:56 aiming for is that it's not stupid
01:13:58 that is the challenge
01:14:00 yeah
01:14:02 but I think I made a bit of
01:14:04 a not a breakthrough but just sort of like an
01:14:06 improvement so that's good
01:14:08 it is not going to be
01:14:10 too long now before I can sketch
01:14:12 the rest of
01:14:14 the pages and then I will have a page
01:14:16 count that I can tell people
01:14:18 and then I will draw it all
01:14:20 you have a
01:14:22 okay wait so this is chapter
01:14:24 two or three
01:14:26 of Clarissa
01:14:28 I don't remember let me go to giveandtake.site
01:14:30 yeah
01:14:32 .site to find out
01:14:34 you're going to definitely want to hit up
01:14:36 giveandtake.site
01:14:38 giveandtake.site there she is Clarissa
01:14:40 Gunsmoke and the bandit king
01:14:42 um also the top
01:14:44 of the page got my site sucked
01:14:46 so much um
01:14:48 come on
01:14:50 come on
01:14:52 show me the show me the money oh no
01:14:54 it's so inefficient
01:14:58 I just want to I don't see the chapter
01:15:00 page how many chapters
01:15:02 do we got
01:15:06 was that button knocked over there okay forget
01:15:08 it one mile
01:15:10 um so we have this first chapter
01:15:12 and then the second chapter
01:15:16 we got three chapters
01:15:18 scrolling down
01:15:22 and I think it's three chapters
01:15:24 yes so this will be chapter four and onwards
01:15:26 I think I have more than a hundred pages
01:15:28 sketched
01:15:30 um more like 90 actually
01:15:32 but uh there's a lot still
01:15:34 to sketch
01:15:36 so who knows
01:15:38 I don't
01:15:40 I'm sorry wait
01:15:42 you see you already have 90
01:15:44 pages let me let me double
01:15:46 check it's probably not 90 it's probably like
01:15:48 50 but it's
01:15:50 sizeable amount sketched and then I still
01:15:52 need to like sketch the last
01:15:54 bit wait wait you've got
01:15:56 50 that are sketched but not
01:15:58 finished not finished
01:16:00 not public yet yes oh wow
01:16:02 that's a lot
01:16:04 yeah I'm not very efficient
01:16:06 with my writing how many are done
01:16:08 and published now
01:16:10 three chapters worth so that's
01:16:12 like how many pages like
01:16:14 20 pages a chapter
01:16:16 uh so yeah
01:16:18 something like that so you're gonna make
01:16:20 more than double it with all this
01:16:22 oh it's new possibly
01:16:24 possibly yeah sounds sounds
01:16:26 like it's headed that way
01:16:28 hmm interesting
01:16:30 hmm so I am
01:16:32 I'm feeling pretty good about
01:16:34 uh making some
01:16:36 progress on it pretty soon
01:16:38 did you ever finish those commissions
01:16:40 no
01:16:42 oh jeez okay
01:16:44 I still gotta do like three
01:16:46 alright so I have been working
01:16:48 on them it's just uh
01:16:50 I look at the commission thing and I'm like
01:16:52 please draw anything and I'm like but
01:16:54 but I can't
01:16:56 but I can't draw anything
01:16:58 not I understand
01:17:00 yeah I I should do those
01:17:02 first I will do those first
01:17:04 I've just been like
01:17:06 like the
01:17:08 I was talking to my therapist and being like
01:17:10 I don't know what I'm doing
01:17:12 and she said like what do you want to do
01:17:14 what do you need what do you want to
01:17:16 like I can't I
01:17:18 not gonna like remember exactly
01:17:20 what the conversation was but the
01:17:22 sure the result was
01:17:24 um I should start
01:17:26 things that I want to
01:17:28 get done rather than waiting for myself
01:17:30 to finish this one thing
01:17:32 I think it gets stuck
01:17:34 too often and I'm like I want to do things
01:17:36 linearly I had the commissions earlier
01:17:38 I said I would do all of the commissions
01:17:40 and then work on other things
01:17:42 so and because of
01:17:44 that I have just not done anything
01:17:46 and so like if I do the
01:17:48 Clarissa stuff at least
01:17:50 I'm getting something done and maybe
01:17:52 it'll just make it easier for me to
01:17:54 get into a working mood and
01:17:56 organize my life and get everything
01:17:58 else done I see so
01:18:00 like in the case that like
01:18:02 yeah
01:18:04 if you're not getting the commissions done
01:18:06 rather than not do anything else
01:18:08 until they're done you might as well
01:18:10 do something else yeah
01:18:12 I see that makes yeah I mean sure
01:18:14 that makes it make sense
01:18:16 not that like huge brain
01:18:18 thing that's just right it is
01:18:20 a consistent problem I love
01:18:22 doing things in order
01:18:24 and I love finishing things before moving on
01:18:26 because I feel like I'm gonna get overwhelmed
01:18:28 with like juggling too many different projects
01:18:30 it is good to do
01:18:32 if possible
01:18:34 it's a good instinct
01:18:36 to have in general
01:18:38 yeah I mean I was starting
01:18:40 to feel bad as well because
01:18:42 I had this idea to make a little video
01:18:44 about my RuneScape thing
01:18:46 and that was being like well
01:18:48 you should do the commissions first before you do that
01:18:50 right
01:18:52 but if you did that
01:18:54 but it would only be a little thing
01:18:56 but if you did that there would just be no video
01:18:58 you would never make it
01:19:00 I would never make the video yeah
01:19:02 so like I forced myself to make a video
01:19:04 because I wanted to do it
01:19:06 and I would feel bad about not
01:19:08 doing it and it wasn't gonna
01:19:10 take that long and it didn't because
01:19:12 I didn't make it a big
01:19:14 edited thing
01:19:16 it was just like a little explanation
01:19:18 few PNGs on the screen that's all you need
01:19:22 so that's done I feel good
01:19:24 that that is done
01:19:26 and now I will do the commissions
01:19:28 and work on Clarissa
01:19:30 at the same time
01:19:32 yeah
01:19:34 oh
01:19:36 oh yeah
01:19:38 yeah yeah
01:19:40 woo
01:19:42 I need to go toilet quick
01:19:44 I will be a moment
01:19:46 you know what me too
01:19:48 lol
01:19:50 I am back
01:19:52 ah boy
01:19:54 okay scared
01:19:56 scary
01:19:58 hey
01:20:00 you know
01:20:02 when you're waiting for a bus
01:20:04 and there's not been a bus in a while
01:20:06 and then suddenly
01:20:08 two buses come at the same time
01:20:10 that's what just happened
01:20:12 in the toilet
01:20:14 what?
01:20:16 because I had a shit
01:20:18 and then suddenly after I was done
01:20:20 it was followed by another shit
01:20:22 what?
01:20:24 you know what I mean
01:20:26 I
01:20:28 yeah you ever get that
01:20:30 I guess
01:20:32 it's like it was like one meal
01:20:34 comes down
01:20:36 and then a different meal
01:20:38 I mean I would probably describe that
01:20:40 as I
01:20:42 as one shit that I just had
01:20:44 I thought I was done
01:20:46 I guess that's exactly the same
01:20:48 as what I said
01:20:50 that's how I would phrase it
01:20:52 but I get what you're saying
01:20:54 I was gonna say that took a while
01:20:56 I was gonna say
01:20:58 my headphones fell out
01:21:00 I must grab
01:21:02 a spell suit
01:21:04 okay I can hear again
01:21:06 hooray
01:21:08 what were we talking about
01:21:12 jeez what were we talking about
01:21:14 we talked about Homestuck then
01:21:16 I talked about Clarissa
01:21:18 oh I think that was it
01:21:20 I think we were talking about Clarissa when you left
01:21:22 we talked about my video
01:21:24 that's my big thing for the day
01:21:26 my move
01:21:28 oh
01:21:30 frickin yeah I said last week
01:21:32 or something
01:21:34 that I had really screwed up
01:21:36 and by not getting a truck
01:21:38 and that's true
01:21:40 this blows
01:21:42 there was no
01:21:44 there was no truck available
01:21:46 in Boston like at all
01:21:48 anywhere I could not find one
01:21:50 my mom found one
01:21:52 in
01:21:54 a town that is closer to
01:21:56 where I grew up
01:21:58 and it's like an hour away
01:22:00 so I'm gonna have to take a train there
01:22:02 pick up a truck
01:22:04 like an hour away and then drive it back
01:22:06 here
01:22:08 fortunately I only have to drive it one way
01:22:10 because I can drop it off
01:22:12 at a different location
01:22:14 but yeah I have to drive this fucking moving
01:22:16 truck on a highway
01:22:18 for like an hour so that's gonna suck
01:22:22 and plus they charge you by the mile so that's a bit
01:22:24 it's gonna cost me like 50 bucks
01:22:26 for nothing
01:22:28 yeah but it's all
01:22:30 it's all I could get
01:22:32 maybe you should learn to live
01:22:34 smaller
01:22:36 less items
01:22:38 like the Buddha
01:22:40 I don't have that many items Gib
01:22:42 I called
01:22:44 U-Haul
01:22:46 and I was trying to get something more
01:22:48 nearby and I asked the guy
01:22:50 I was like
01:22:52 what if I just rented one on like before
01:22:54 he was like no we don't have anything on the 30th
01:22:56 I was like what if I rented one before
01:22:58 what if I got one on the 29th
01:23:00 and he was like well you'd have to have it back the next day
01:23:02 and I said what if I didn't
01:23:04 and the guy was like
01:23:06 well then some family
01:23:08 that needed a truck wouldn't have it
01:23:10 and I said yeah
01:23:12 but what would happen to me though
01:23:14 and he was like well
01:23:16 I guess we'd find you and I was like
01:23:18 hmm okay
01:23:20 how much?
01:23:22 honestly I mean
01:23:24 fine by me
01:23:26 kind of
01:23:28 decided it was easier to just
01:23:30 drive an hour that's fine
01:23:32 I wouldn't feel good about depriving
01:23:34 someone else of their rental
01:23:36 hmm
01:23:38 but I'd cope
01:23:40 yeah I'd be okay though
01:23:42 um
01:23:44 yeah so
01:23:46 that's what I gotta do
01:23:48 not tomorrow but the next day Tuesday
01:23:50 I'm gonna have to get up early on Tuesday
01:23:52 morning
01:23:54 because apparently
01:23:56 frickin my landlord asked me
01:23:58 when I'm gonna be out and I said
01:24:00 well the lease says the 30th so I guess
01:24:02 I'm gonna leave on the 30th
01:24:04 and she emailed me and said
01:24:06 like
01:24:08 the guys that I've been saying
01:24:10 have been doing renovations on my place
01:24:12 they're gonna be, she said they're gonna be here
01:24:14 on the 30th early in the morning
01:24:16 on the 30th they're gonna be like
01:24:18 drilling into my wall or something
01:24:20 so
01:24:22 I don't know I guess I'm gonna have to work
01:24:24 around them or something
01:24:26 that's gonna
01:24:28 be annoying
01:24:30 I don't
01:24:32 I don't know
01:24:34 I feel like she
01:24:36 I feel like she might be overstepping her bounds
01:24:38 a little bit lately sending dudes
01:24:40 to like
01:24:42 spend time in our rooms to like
01:24:44 do work on our walls and stuff
01:24:46 I feel like maybe she's not allowed to do that
01:24:48 while we're still living here
01:24:50 yeah
01:24:52 but whatever it's inconsiderate
01:24:54 at the very least
01:24:56 but whatever it's too late
01:24:58 I'm gonna leave now and I'll be gone soon
01:25:02 I
01:25:04 I think I successfully
01:25:06 hoodwinked her out of a month's rent though
01:25:08 I don't think I'm gonna have to pay
01:25:10 that last month's rent
01:25:12 nice
01:25:14 yeah so
01:25:16 pretty good honestly
01:25:18 that's
01:25:20 you should leave
01:25:22 like a
01:25:24 a calling card saying that you didn't do that
01:25:26 you didn't pay last month's rent
01:25:28 that's like haha you've been swindled
01:25:30 by the great Ben saying that's a great idea
01:25:32 there's no way that that
01:25:34 could be used against me in any kind of civil
01:25:36 settlement
01:25:42 leave a card
01:25:44 saying um
01:25:46 yeah I did cry
01:25:48 I stole here's some money that I stole from you
01:25:50 here's the exact amount here's how I did
01:25:52 it here's my new contact information
01:25:54 in case you want to reach me to talk
01:25:56 about it
01:25:58 bye
01:26:02 mm-hmm it's just like what a great criminal
01:26:04 does when they steal the priceless jewel
01:26:06 that's what they put their calling card
01:26:08 and they laugh in the face of the
01:26:10 authorities mm-hmm that's yeah
01:26:12 that that's why they're great criminals
01:26:14 criminal masterminds is because they make it
01:26:16 really easy to catch them
01:26:20 they put their alter ego they say Batman
01:26:22 was here except Batman is not a criminal
01:26:24 no if Batman were really good
01:26:26 he would just leave a card that says
01:26:28 the exact address
01:26:30 of the Batcave detailed instructions
01:26:32 for entering it his name
01:26:34 security number
01:26:36 etc etc that would be
01:26:38 if he was really the world's greatest detective
01:26:40 that's I think what would happen
01:26:44 man oh man
01:26:46 so that's gonna suck
01:26:48 I don't
01:26:50 they're like oh somebody stole the crown jewels
01:26:52 or like they opened the safe and like
01:26:54 oh it's gone
01:26:56 what's this and somebody's driver's license
01:27:00 with their face
01:27:02 and all their information
01:27:04 I have a
01:27:06 I have a mattress I have I replaced
01:27:08 my mattress at some point
01:27:10 because my old one was gross
01:27:12 so I still have it like
01:27:14 it's sort of like against a wall
01:27:16 I never I never got rid of it
01:27:18 so
01:27:20 I'm considering like
01:27:22 I'm not exactly sure how to dispose
01:27:24 of a mattress
01:27:26 there's probably a right way I don't think you can just
01:27:28 have the fucking trash guys pick it up
01:27:30 on the sidewalk
01:27:32 but
01:27:34 I have some
01:27:36 I think I might have to pay to get it
01:27:38 disposed of and alternatives
01:27:40 that I'm rolling around
01:27:42 in my mind are one
01:27:44 leave it on the sidewalk
01:27:46 anyway because
01:27:48 what are they gonna do
01:27:50 come and find me no
01:27:52 nobody's gonna know that it's my mattress
01:27:54 someone the landlord
01:27:56 will have to deal with it
01:27:58 to
01:28:00 maybe just leave it in
01:28:02 the room of one of the other guys that has already
01:28:04 moved out
01:28:06 just put it in there and put it on the floor
01:28:08 and leave and she won't know
01:28:10 that I left it
01:28:12 uh
01:28:14 what would they do
01:28:16 I think the second one
01:28:18 might be better
01:28:20 because maybe the person moving in
01:28:22 is like oh cool free mattress
01:28:24 yeah
01:28:26 possibly
01:28:30 yeah I might just do that
01:28:32 I don't really see any downside
01:28:34 and it means I don't have to deal with it
01:28:36 it's a bad
01:28:38 mattress and I don't think anyone would really want
01:28:40 this mattress that's why I replaced it
01:28:42 but
01:28:44 um
01:28:46 what's the right way
01:28:48 how
01:28:50 to dispose of a
01:28:52 mattress
01:28:54 you beat the shit out of it
01:28:56 discard literally
01:28:58 oh yeah discarded mattresses
01:29:00 and boxers can be notoriously difficult to
01:29:02 manage they're expensive to transport
01:29:04 so recycling
01:29:06 or use
01:29:08 okay mattresses and textiles are
01:29:10 banned from disposal or
01:29:12 transport for disposal
01:29:14 okay most mattress
01:29:16 and box spring components can be easily
01:29:18 disassembled and recycled
01:29:20 okay
01:29:22 so spring mattress
01:29:24 mattress recycling
01:29:26 incentive programs
01:29:28 I think it is a spring mattress
01:29:30 donate
01:29:32 you can donate to a charity
01:29:34 find a commercial mattress recycler
01:29:36 okay there there might be
01:29:38 there might be a municipal
01:29:40 program for like collecting mattresses
01:29:42 for recycling
01:29:44 I don't see my town on here though
01:29:46 where you live you go to eat
01:29:48 the mattress to get rid of it
01:29:50 I don't see
01:29:52 Alston or Brighton on here
01:29:54 so that's
01:29:56 hmmmm
01:29:58 Cambridge is not too far
01:30:00 hmmmm
01:30:02 whatever
01:30:04 I'll leave it in someone else's room
01:30:06 fuck it
01:30:08 uhhhh
01:30:10 I hate this landlady
01:30:12 I hope she has more problems in the future
01:30:14 I hope she has to deal with it
01:30:16 I consider that a
01:30:18 bonus is that it would be annoying for her
01:30:20 um
01:30:22 yeah
01:30:24 anyway those are my moving
01:30:26 concerns
01:30:30 I'm tired just thinking
01:30:32 about it
01:30:34 hmm I'm gonna have a nice long nap
01:30:36 on this mattress about it
01:30:38 because of how tired I am
01:30:40 I don't want to sleep on this mattress
01:30:42 it doesn't smell great
01:30:44 my new mattress is great
01:30:46 it's delightful
01:30:48 um
01:30:50 hey
01:30:52 what is
01:30:54 HD
01:30:56 resolution
01:30:58 high definition
01:31:00 that's HD
01:31:02 1920 by 1080
01:31:04 ok well my camera
01:31:06 will record in
01:31:08 uhhhh hang on
01:31:10 hang on hang on
01:31:12 my camera can record in
01:31:16 ok 2
01:31:18 560 by 14
01:31:20 42
01:31:22 which is not 4k
01:31:24 ok apparently 4k
01:31:26 is
01:31:28 3 by 2160
01:31:30 I assumed it would be 4000
01:31:32 yeah it's the 38
01:31:34 but it's close enough to 4 so I think
01:31:36 that's why
01:31:38 so my
01:31:40 my camera will it will not record in 4k
01:31:42 but it will record in like
01:31:44 in above HD
01:31:46 which is
01:31:48 fine I think I kind of wish I had
01:31:50 I kind of wish I could film in 4k
01:31:52 I think a little more resolution would be good
01:31:54 but I feel like
01:31:56 I feel like the expectation
01:31:58 is not that videos need to be
01:32:00 in 4k on youtube
01:32:02 I don't think anyone's going to be like
01:32:04 this isn't in 4k I can't watch this
01:32:06 um
01:32:08 yeah it's still like HD
01:32:10 is good enough
01:32:12 from most anything
01:32:14 yeah
01:32:16 I'm surprised
01:32:18 I could film in this
01:32:20 above HD resolution
01:32:22 and a minute of footage
01:32:24 is about 125
01:32:26 megabytes
01:32:28 so like
01:32:30 15 minutes of footage is like
01:32:32 1.8 gigs
01:32:34 and my phone is pretty empty
01:32:36 so it has like 40 gigs of storage on it
01:32:38 so I can store like
01:32:40 I can store like
01:32:42 uh
01:32:44 I think um
01:32:48 I think 30 minutes by
01:32:50 10
01:32:52 I can store like 300 minutes
01:32:54 I can store like 5 hours of
01:32:56 footage on that thing
01:32:58 that is quite a big
01:33:00 amount
01:33:02 my phone
01:33:04 I don't know how much my phone has actually
01:33:06 so I might have to like
01:33:08 set it to start recording
01:33:10 let it go and then I'll have
01:33:12 I have to
01:33:14 it will
01:33:16 I want to record it in chunks because
01:33:18 if anything happens I don't want to lose everything
01:33:20 the downside
01:33:22 to that is that
01:33:24 I can only tell it to restart recording
01:33:26 up to like 10 times
01:33:28 so if I'm recording like
01:33:30 15 minute segments
01:33:32 I can only record 10 of them
01:33:34 and also there's a little bit of a break
01:33:36 like it's not a smooth continue
01:33:38 I check this there's a little bit of a cut
01:33:40 each time it stops recording and starts again
01:33:42 so I will just have
01:33:44 to keep an eye on the time I'll like
01:33:46 I'll start it at exactly
01:33:48 a 30 minute point on the clock
01:33:50 and I'll just have to keep my eye on the time
01:33:52 and any time it's getting to be
01:33:54 an hour or half hour
01:33:56 I'll just have to know like there's going to be a cut here
01:33:58 I should like wait to start my next sentence
01:34:00 until
01:34:02 until the half hour mark
01:34:04 passes and then I can start again
01:34:06 mmm
01:34:08 that's my plan
01:34:10 I hope it works
01:34:12 okay thank you
01:34:14 I'm rambling
01:34:16 now
01:34:18 I have
01:34:20 been thinking a lot
01:34:22 about how this all works
01:34:24 it's very complicated
01:34:26 literally just to like
01:34:28 this is all just in service
01:34:30 of just like setting up a camera on a tripod
01:34:32 and telling it to record
01:34:34 I have had to consider
01:34:36 all of these things
01:34:40 it's so hard
01:34:42 being a content creator
01:34:44 it's so hard
01:34:46 being a successful content creator
01:34:48 like Ben St
01:34:54 it do be like that
01:34:56 yeah
01:34:58 well hey
01:35:00 we've been going for an hour 40
01:35:02 what do you think about going to the
01:35:04 Ask PCP questions
01:35:06 uh
01:35:10 sure
01:35:12 I can't think of anything
01:35:14 off the top of my head else that I need to
01:35:16 there's only one thing
01:35:18 and it's that I'm going to be doing
01:35:20 like Sunday assessments
01:35:22 of my work
01:35:24 there's another thing the therapist told me to start doing
01:35:26 Sunday assessments
01:35:28 assessment time
01:35:30 where I go over the previous week
01:35:32 and what I
01:35:34 accomplished
01:35:36 and it's not supposed to be like
01:35:38 an opinion piece
01:35:40 it's just sort of like
01:35:42 factual information what was done
01:35:44 and then make a plan
01:35:46 for the next week so what am I going to work on
01:35:48 next week and I feel like
01:35:50 having like a time
01:35:52 a thing happening an event
01:35:54 a Sunday assessment period
01:35:56 will help me to be like alright
01:35:58 let's actually like plan out the next week
01:36:02 so today is going to be my first one of those
01:36:06 and I hope it works
01:36:08 for productivity
01:36:10 makes sense
01:36:12 makes sense so
01:36:14 it's just like you write
01:36:16 a list of everything that was done
01:36:18 yeah I just sort of go over
01:36:20 the things that I accomplished
01:36:22 um
01:36:24 and not to like make it into like a
01:36:26 like a
01:36:28 talking down to or like a telling off
01:36:30 like oh you didn't meet the quota you motherfucker
01:36:32 it's not about
01:36:34 punishing myself it's just about like
01:36:36 keeping track I suppose of what
01:36:38 I was able to do
01:36:42 so that when I plan things
01:36:44 going forward I can adjust
01:36:46 plans to be like okay
01:36:48 uh
01:36:50 do less work because it was too much
01:36:52 or do more work because
01:36:54 uh you can
01:36:56 and you or whatever
01:36:58 I don't know how to do exactly
01:37:00 I'm gonna figure it out but like I like the idea
01:37:02 I like the idea of
01:37:04 of
01:37:06 getting a little document
01:37:08 little like clipboard and I like
01:37:10 writing down notes
01:37:12 ah yes
01:37:14 my life is
01:37:16 within my control because you see I wrote down
01:37:18 a lot of numbers
01:37:20 yeah makes
01:37:22 make sense to me checks out
01:37:24 uh oh fuck wait a minute
01:37:26 I need more caffeine it's been
01:37:28 four hours since I had any caffeine
01:37:30 and that's
01:37:32 just not gonna work for me
01:37:34 okay
01:37:36 alright
01:37:38 is that fine
01:37:40 that's that's fine but I'm drinking
01:37:42 caffeine right now I'm drinking a cup of tea
01:37:44 cup of cup of Yorkshire gold
01:37:46 a cup of
01:37:48 have a
01:37:50 have a cup of you
01:37:52 perver
01:37:54 huh
01:37:56 when people say cup of
01:37:58 I've heard like Hagrid and Harry Potter
01:38:00 he says have a cup of
01:38:02 is that just short for a cup of tea yeah
01:38:04 what do you think you meant
01:38:06 no I mean that's what I thought it meant
01:38:08 sounds dumb I don't like it
01:38:10 finish your damn sentence you freak
01:38:12 yeah no we're all about
01:38:14 conjugations or whatever
01:38:16 hideous
01:38:18 hideous
01:38:20 like uh saw right would be
01:38:22 it is alright
01:38:24 well I mean that's that's like pretty normal
01:38:26 Saul Goodman yeah
01:38:28 Saul Goodman sure
01:38:30 um that I mean that one
01:38:32 there's more extreme examples I can't
01:38:34 really think of them though it's the top of my head
01:38:36 but like yeah
01:38:38 shorten those words words suck
01:38:40 who cares just get that info
01:38:42 get that brain chemistry
01:38:44 longer words longer words for
01:38:46 longer content make the video
01:38:48 longer make it last
01:38:50 forever make the video never end
01:38:52 see this is a capitalism in action
01:38:54 you're elongating your vocabulary
01:38:56 170,000
01:38:58 hours of lo-fi
01:39:00 hip-hop beats to study and chill too
01:39:02 please make those longest
01:39:04 words we can think of in our
01:39:06 hip-hop beats um
01:39:08 return to monkey grunt
01:39:10 okay let's uh
01:39:12 let's look
01:39:14 at some there was actually some
01:39:16 some questions we missed
01:39:18 last week
01:39:20 yeah well did they come out
01:39:22 during recording or
01:39:24 they came out a little later
01:39:26 uh so it's not our fault
01:39:28 uh but I want to I do want to read
01:39:30 them actually one of them
01:39:32 is if you can believe it
01:39:34 it's I think it's a it's an art
01:39:36 post from new

01:44:34 artistic effect why would he do that

01:45:46 yeah I'd buy this
01:45:48 if it were printed
01:45:50 this is so good I
01:45:52 love it
01:45:54 I'm glad that I was wrong but it's not
01:45:56 the last
01:45:58 the last art meal
01:46:00 how could this be the end
01:46:02 how could this be the end
01:46:04 leave me hanging
01:46:06 in suspense
01:46:08 delightful
01:46:10 alright well I'm glad I almost missed it
01:46:12 because it was posted last week
01:46:14 but I found it
01:46:18 gonna save that image
01:46:20 yeah
01:46:22 next one is from rip dot
01:46:24 what is your favorite musical
01:46:26 do you ever listen to musical soundtracks
01:46:28 on their own or do you only enjoy seeing them
01:46:30 in person
01:46:32 funny if you assume that I see musicals
01:46:34 in person I don't think I've ever seen
01:46:36 a musical in person
01:46:38 I think I've seen
01:46:42 I've seen spam a lot in person
01:46:44 I've never seen that
01:46:46 yeah it's a Monty Python musical
01:46:48 yeah yeah
01:46:50 that's pretty good
01:46:52 I haven't really seen that many
01:46:54 I have seen
01:46:58 actual musicals that I've seen
01:47:00 and again I have never been to one live
01:47:02 I saw the Spongebob musical
01:47:04 of course which I thought was great
01:47:06 I've watched
01:47:08 I guess it wasn't really a musical
01:47:10 because I watched the
01:47:12 the 70s filmed version
01:47:14 of Jesus Christ Superstar
01:47:16 which is based on musical
01:47:18 yeah I
01:47:20 I guess I'd have to say the Spongebob musical
01:47:22 is the only actual musical
01:47:24 that I feel any
01:47:26 particular way about
01:47:28 is Peter and the Wolf
01:47:30 a musical
01:47:32 you know Peter and the Wolf
01:47:34 I know of it I've never seen it
01:47:36 it's set to
01:47:38 an orchestral score
01:47:40 yeah it's like an orchestral score
01:47:42 and it's an animation
01:47:44 the most famous one I think
01:47:46 is a stop motion animation thing
01:47:48 Peter and there's a cat and there's a wolf
01:47:50 I feel like a musical
01:47:52 as this guy means to say
01:47:54 is like
01:47:56 performed live on stage
01:47:58 sure because I went to see
01:48:00 like a live
01:48:02 like orchestrated
01:48:04 Peter and the Wolf but the animated
01:48:06 show was like on the screen
01:48:08 and then the orchestra was playing live
01:48:10 that was pretty good
01:48:12 interesting
01:48:14 um
01:48:16 mappa
01:48:18 mappa
01:48:20 mappashidepan
01:48:22 because why the fuck do you guys have so much lore
01:48:24 like I want to listen to your podcast
01:48:26 but every five minutes you're representing some person
01:48:28 who hates your channel
01:48:30 because some con that happened four years ago
01:48:32 or shit like that
01:48:34 I guess we've just been on the internet
01:48:36 long enough that we've collected
01:48:38 we've accrued
01:48:40 lore
01:48:42 through time
01:48:44 we've accrued relationships
01:48:46 and with people
01:48:48 that have
01:48:50 played out in various ways and now
01:48:52 that's all part of
01:48:54 the stuff that happened
01:48:56 see what we're doing
01:48:58 is we're making it
01:49:00 so long and confusing
01:49:02 that we can make a lecture about it
01:49:04 and rake in the big bucks
01:49:06 that's the plan
01:49:08 if only
01:49:10 if only someone had the idea
01:49:12 to make a lecture that explained
01:49:14 the origins of the horseshoe crew
01:49:16 and
01:49:18 the
01:49:20 formation of the pcp
01:49:22 that would have been a lecture that I think people would have wanted to watch
01:49:26 oh yeah
01:49:28 I didn't realize what you were referencing
01:49:30 I am of course referring
01:49:32 to the brony lecture much of which
01:49:34 was concerned with the
01:49:36 formation of the horseshoe crew and the pcp
01:49:40 but
01:49:42 I spilled some shit
01:49:44 okay
01:49:46 and it's wiped
01:49:48 next one is
01:49:52 from jade
01:49:54 how are you doing be honest I care about your well being
01:49:56 well
01:49:58 for me
01:50:00 I am feeling hopeful
01:50:02 about this video project
01:50:04 I feel
01:50:06 that makes me feel hopeful
01:50:08 that I think it will do well
01:50:10 I think it will
01:50:12 be nice to have done something
01:50:14 in a while
01:50:16 I'm feeling
01:50:18 stressed about the move but maybe not stressed enough
01:50:20 because I haven't packed
01:50:22 I mean I've packed somewhat but I have a lot more to do
01:50:24 so
01:50:26 there's that
01:50:28 and that's it
01:50:32 I feel
01:50:34 I feel
01:50:36 similar
01:50:38 I'm optimistic for projects
01:50:40 I feel
01:50:42 I mean it did kind of have a breakdown
01:50:44 like just the other day
01:50:46 but then by the end of the day I was okay
01:50:48 I think there's just a
01:50:50 talk about that
01:50:52 nah
01:50:54 it was mostly a gender dysphoria thing
01:50:56 but like
01:50:58 things like that happen from time to time
01:51:00 and it's just sort of
01:51:02 what changes is my ability
01:51:04 to deal with it and work through it
01:51:06 and then feel better afterwards
01:51:08 and I think that has improved
01:51:10 since having a therapist
01:51:12 and
01:51:14 yeah
01:51:16 I'm more capable
01:51:18 your therapist is a cis woman
01:51:20 I believe so
01:51:22 yeah okay
01:51:26 you should kill her
01:51:28 you should punish her
01:51:30 no she's great
01:51:32 is she
01:51:34 uh oh
01:51:36 bad news
01:51:38 I'm getting indoctrinated
01:51:40 yeah
01:51:42 but yeah
01:51:44 I think my life is
01:51:46 is alright
01:51:48 and I'm feeling okay
01:51:50 it's
01:51:52 things can come my way
01:51:54 and it'll be like oh that's bad that sucks
01:51:56 obviously the news is always depressing
01:51:58 but I'm more
01:52:00 capable of handling things
01:52:02 no not all news
01:52:04 actually
01:52:06 I think we did
01:52:08 you know what
01:52:10 I'm not gonna mention it
01:52:12 because there's a question
01:52:14 coming up but there was
01:52:16 some good news this week that was very funny
01:52:18 so
01:52:20 we'll get to that in a minute
01:52:22 yeah I'm alright
01:52:24 yeah
01:52:26 um
01:52:28 aboro asks
01:52:30 with infinite time money and access to
01:52:32 anything and anyone you want
01:52:34 what would you create artistically
01:52:36 so anything
01:52:38 you could do anything at all
01:52:40 what would you make
01:52:42 infinite time money
01:52:44 and access to anyone I want
01:52:48 also presuming they want
01:52:50 to work with me on this
01:52:52 yeah
01:52:54 I mean that's kind of like too many options
01:52:56 or you can pay
01:52:58 enough money that you can get anyone
01:53:00 you can get friggin
01:53:02 I don't know who's the
01:53:04 most expensive celebrity
01:53:06 in Hollywood right now
01:53:08 the no
01:53:10 doja cat
01:53:12 doja coin
01:53:14 I would
01:53:16 get
01:53:18 I get
01:53:20 Sergio Leone
01:53:22 and Ennio Morricone
01:53:24 the duo that made the movie
01:53:26 and music for
01:53:28 spaghetti westerns like the good the bad and the ugly
01:53:30 I'd get those two guys
01:53:32 and then I would have them make
01:53:34 the Clarissa Gunsmoke Wild West
01:53:36 movie
01:53:38 I don't know who would play Clarissa
01:53:40 maybe it would be even it
01:53:42 animated I get Quentin Tarantino
01:53:44 and
01:53:46 Sergio Leone
01:53:48 to co-direct
01:53:50 the movie
01:53:52 with Hayao Miyazaki's team
01:53:54 and
01:53:56 sure Hayao Miyazaki as well
01:53:58 and then Ennio Morricone for the film
01:54:00 and his Clarissa Gunsmoke the Wild West
01:54:02 feature big film
01:54:04 that's what I would do
01:54:06 so you would make
01:54:08 a western
01:54:10 yeah
01:54:12 okay westerns are so fucking cool
01:54:14 they're like pirates
01:54:16 but on the desert
01:54:18 a little bit
01:54:20 did you see the new red letter media
01:54:22 where they talk about the good the bad and the ugly
01:54:24 it did remind me of how much I love that
01:54:26 yeah
01:54:28 I went back and
01:54:30 I listened to the soundtrack
01:54:32 and I'm like
01:54:36 Ennio Morricone is like the Toby Fox
01:54:38 of
01:54:40 cinema
01:54:42 now there's a comparison
01:54:44 um
01:54:46 do you mean because he makes
01:54:48 his own soundtrack to his music
01:54:50 no no Ennio Morricone is the
01:54:52 musician he's the
01:54:54 orchestrator and Sergio Leone
01:54:56 is the director
01:54:58 but Ennio Morricone is just like
01:55:00 the songs he made for the westerns
01:55:02 and the films he worked on
01:55:04 are just so powerful
01:55:06 and cool and like perfect
01:55:08 and how could somebody be that good at making
01:55:10 music
01:55:12 and it's the sort of thing where you listen to it
01:55:14 and everything
01:55:16 the experience of watching the film comes back
01:55:18 and it's like
01:55:20 just like Toby Fox
01:55:22 yeah
01:55:24 yeah
01:55:26 I found
01:55:28 a disgusting thread on twitter that I hate
01:55:30 and I'm not going to look at it anymore
01:55:32 with infinite money time and resources
01:55:34 I would make angry posts
01:55:36 on twitter I would say fuck you
01:55:38 um
01:55:40 god
01:55:42 infinite
01:55:44 I could make anything I want
01:55:46 anything at all
01:55:48 and the Muppets would be there
01:55:50 the Muppets I would have curbed
01:55:52 the whole Muppets
01:55:54 troop yeah
01:55:56 it would be like a multimedia thing
01:55:58 it would be like there's live action stuff
01:56:00 with the Muppets but also
01:56:02 a Ghibli film animation
01:56:04 segments
01:56:06 with Clarissa Gunsmoke
01:56:08 and she shoots her gun
01:56:10 and she's so cool
01:56:12 when she does it
01:56:14 I
01:56:16 I don't know
01:56:18 I don't know if I can answer
01:56:20 I can't think of anything
01:56:22 would I make
01:56:24 like a cartoon
01:56:26 would I like make a whole studio cartoon
01:56:28 of something I don't know
01:56:30 what would it be
01:56:32 maybe I would
01:56:34 maybe I would
01:56:38 maybe I would
01:56:42 maybe I would get
01:56:44 some writers together
01:56:46 or something maybe I would just
01:56:48 workshop
01:56:50 with some writers
01:56:52 maybe I would get a team together
01:56:54 and we would just come up with something
01:56:56 we would come up with something we wanted to make
01:56:58 and maybe that's what I would
01:57:00 I would first invest in
01:57:02 getting people together to come up with something
01:57:04 that we wanted to make and maybe it would be
01:57:06 I'm thinking maybe a cartoon
01:57:08 or maybe a video game
01:57:10 you know I would probably make a video game
01:57:12 I think I would probably make a
01:57:14 I don't know what it would be but I think if I could
01:57:16 yeah if I could make any
01:57:18 piece of art or tell a story
01:57:20 in any medium and there were no limits
01:57:22 I think I would go with a video game
01:57:24 and
01:57:26 the details beyond
01:57:28 that are
01:57:30 I don't know
01:57:34 that's all I got
01:57:36 my answer sucks
01:57:38 alright
01:57:40 next
01:57:42 where
01:57:44 was I sorry I lost my
01:57:46 lost my place
01:57:50 Brody Pujas says
01:57:52 no voicemail no watch okay
01:57:54 oh and then some people commented
01:57:56 on the bonus episode which I'll remind
01:57:58 people I did release the
01:58:00 Bencast Ben commentary
01:58:02 bonus episode
01:58:04 oh yes I haven't seen that
01:58:06 it is about an hour long
01:58:08 as was the original
01:58:10 Bencast
01:58:12 and also
01:58:14 what was I gonna say
01:58:16 someone pointed out someone else on
01:58:18 Twitter pointed out that
01:58:20 why didn't I call
01:58:22 the calm Ben Terry
01:58:24 and I definitely should have
01:58:26 so that's my bad
01:58:28 well that would be like a comb
01:58:30 like a like a
01:58:32 like a honeycomb or a hair comb
01:58:34 comb Ben Terry
01:58:36 yeah I guess but like what's the
01:58:38 joke in Ben commentary
01:58:40 there's it's
01:58:42 yeah
01:58:44 combination
01:58:46 combination Ben Saint and Ben Saint
01:58:48 the next one
01:58:50 is
01:58:52 it's from Roxanne Kaiser
01:58:54 and it says check out this guy's work
01:58:56 and I think this is links to
01:58:58 more Vinny
01:59:00 more Vinny art
01:59:02 so I guess let's
01:59:04 Vinny has continued to
01:59:06 DM me on discord
01:59:08 and I have continued to not look
01:59:10 at them because I generally
01:59:12 look at them on
01:59:14 the podcast
01:59:16 okay this is
01:59:18 this is Saber spark so
01:59:20 that's not
01:59:22 a podcast member
01:59:24 Saber spark with Tom in a wheelchair
01:59:26 stand
01:59:28 God please you will just kill me now
01:59:30 wait are you that's not the first one
01:59:32 this is the second one I'm looking at
01:59:34 okay the first one gets heavier
01:59:36 the more clout his opponent has
01:59:38 his sword gets
01:59:40 Tom says God please just kill me now
01:59:42 so I was watching a children's cartoon
01:59:44 and making very artistic critics
01:59:46 and posting about it on twitter today
01:59:48 many many people retweeted my hot takes
01:59:50 on pause of fury and how the one cat
01:59:52 wears a thong my precious good boy persona
01:59:54 had to have many points of dialogue over
01:59:56 how there are always perverted images being
01:59:58 snuck into my otherwise wholesome children's media
02:00:00 furthermore my patreon has exploded
02:00:02 from mom
02:00:04 moms retweeting it and giving me money
02:00:06 to take down furry cartoons
02:00:08 with too many subliminal messages ruining
02:00:10 the innocent minds of their children
02:00:12 watching these shows
02:00:14 is that a thing?
02:00:16 I don't think he
02:00:18 does he have a patreon?
02:00:20 surely
02:00:22 I don't think he makes most of his money
02:00:24 through patreon
02:00:26 I guess he doesn't seem like the type
02:00:28 that would have patreon like fans
02:00:30 but he could get a lot of views
02:00:32 yeah
02:00:34 no I don't see a patreon
02:00:36 when I google
02:00:38 wait saberspray pink
02:00:40 no I'm wrong
02:00:42 I'm stupid yeah there is one
02:00:44 how much does he make on patreon
02:00:46 $17,000
02:00:48 he has
02:00:50 okay
02:00:52 $315 patrons so he's probably making
02:00:54 $1,000 or $2,000
02:00:56 that's not
02:00:58 I think he makes more money
02:01:00 through ad revenue and partnerships
02:01:02 and sponsorships and stuff
02:01:04 who cares
02:01:06 anyway
02:01:08 back to whatever we were looking at
02:01:10 shit I lost
02:01:12 the page

02:10:36 unlimited or even first edition
02:10:38 even though they're much much newer
02:10:40 I want to shout out Derek H for selling me these
02:10:42 sold me these at a good price so that we could make a video
02:10:44 talking about Yu-Gi-Oh cards
02:10:46 because I always love opening these up
02:10:48 and these are the 2017 print
02:10:50 so if you don't know, Legend of the West has many many
02:10:52 different prints and originally came out in 2002
02:10:54 the first edition print
02:10:56 and then many prints after that
02:10:58 but these reaper packs started in
02:11:00 2010 out of the legendary collection
02:11:02 binder edition then they made the
02:11:04 game board edition in 2013 and 2017
02:11:06 so these packs have been around for
02:11:08 not as long but they're still
02:11:10 actually kind of over
02:11:12 okay good that's the
02:11:14 voicemail experience right there
02:11:16 yeah I miss it
02:11:18 no killer kauri says
02:11:20 what y'all think about the white house
02:11:22 dunking on republicans and biden being
02:11:24 based for once this was the news I mentioned
02:11:26 before uh yeah biden
02:11:28 did some student loan forgiveness
02:11:30 shockingly
02:11:32 some good news
02:11:34 actually did it
02:11:36 yeah I wish I hadn't paid my loans
02:11:38 off
02:11:40 but oh well
02:11:42 I got a little bit punked
02:11:44 yeah I got a little bit punked by that
02:11:46 should it just kept being delinquent
02:11:48 but
02:11:50 oh well
02:11:52 it's uh yeah it's like
02:11:54 I'm pretty sure it's like
02:11:56 they're pulling out like the big guns
02:11:58 for the midterms like
02:12:00 well now people think we're cool
02:12:02 and I'm like well uh I mean
02:12:04 it is student loan forgiveness so
02:12:06 fine that's pretty good
02:12:08 yeah I do like the way they've been
02:12:10 handling like
02:12:12 uh like
02:12:14 shitting on republicans for just being
02:12:16 anti everything good
02:12:18 I haven't really seen a lot of it I've
02:12:20 been hearing that the
02:12:22 the verbiage coming out of
02:12:24 the white house has been based lately but
02:12:26 it's I think it was a
02:12:28 twitter account like the white house twitter
02:12:30 account was like
02:12:32 quoting
02:12:34 republicans saying oh this forgiveness
02:12:36 is so bad and then
02:12:38 they're just pointing out like
02:12:40 that this person got like
02:12:42 subsidies from the government
02:12:44 to like repay loans
02:12:46 for stuff
02:12:48 you can do it you can always do it
02:12:50 everyone everyone who
02:12:52 bitches about it is some rich
02:12:54 asshole that
02:12:56 has some fucking stupid
02:12:58 business loans or ppp loans
02:13:00 that they've taken out and had forgiven
02:13:04 yeah good it's never about
02:13:06 it's never been about like fairness
02:13:08 no they always
02:13:10 talk about how it's not fair but like
02:13:12 it really has never been about it
02:13:14 no they don't actually care
02:13:16 they're just already
02:13:18 they're already on top and they want to stay
02:13:20 that way
02:13:22 every time
02:13:24 so yeah
02:13:26 killer cowrie I guess I would say
02:13:28 that it seems cool
02:13:30 I guess I wish he did it more often
02:13:32 but I'll take what I can get
02:13:34 Biden does some
02:13:36 some okay things sometimes
02:13:38 even though even though
02:13:40 he's like
02:13:42 even though he was like historically like anti
02:13:44 abortion
02:13:46 and I think he was also kind of a little bit of a
02:13:48 segregationist
02:13:50 that's bad but like the things he's
02:13:52 done
02:13:54 as president
02:13:56 he's been pretty like good about like
02:13:58 protecting trans rights
02:14:00 he's been pretty pro-abortion
02:14:02 I mean he has
02:14:04 but like
02:14:08 I don't know what
02:14:10 he can do to like
02:14:12 stop certain things
02:14:14 so it feels like he's not doing anything
02:14:16 and he is just saying
02:14:18 I have solidarity
02:14:20 and then Roe v. Wade is like
02:14:22 what can be done
02:14:24 for about that I don't know
02:14:26 yeah
02:14:28 can he do anything
02:14:30 he's at least
02:14:32 made his
02:14:34 stance clear I guess
02:14:36 stance is clear which is good
02:14:38 I don't think he can do anything
02:14:40 personally about
02:14:42 Roe v. Wade
02:14:44 that's a judicial
02:14:46 I guess wait
02:14:48 something something codified
02:14:50 is that something you do by executive order
02:14:52 or is that something you do in congress
02:14:54 I don't actually know how it works
02:14:56 I think
02:14:58 I don't trust Biden to be like
02:15:00 suddenly like
02:15:02 a super progressive
02:15:04 person
02:15:06 but if he does good things then that is good
02:15:08 right
02:15:10 like if it helps him stay in power
02:15:12 to be more socialist
02:15:14 and more progressive
02:15:16 then I guess that's good for everyone
02:15:18 yeah
02:15:20 next one
02:15:22 Kuzco asks
02:15:24 when will Ben continue his new adventures
02:15:26 of Winnie the Pooh retrospective
02:15:28 I'm craving for it for almost three years now
02:15:30 and I feel I'm going to explode
02:15:32 has it been three years
02:15:34 that sucks
02:15:36 Jesus
02:15:38 I do mean to finish it
02:15:40 I have always intended to finish
02:15:42 uh
02:15:44 I don't know exactly when
02:15:46 but definitely after this current video
02:15:48 is done
02:15:50 after that's done
02:15:52 I probably won't do it right away
02:15:54 but I do have
02:15:56 I think it's going to be
02:15:58 when I kind of don't really have anything else
02:16:00 that I'm like
02:16:02 actively working on
02:16:04 I'm going to be like okay now is the time
02:16:06 I can you know take a little
02:16:08 time and just finish that
02:16:10 series up because I
02:16:12 I do want to but it's not like a super high priority
02:16:14 there are other things that are more
02:16:16 pressing
02:16:18 so when the pressing things are
02:16:20 relieved
02:16:22 that will be
02:16:24 when I do that
02:16:26 um
02:16:28 number one
02:16:30 Ikutsuki Stan account
02:16:32 asks have you explored each other's bodies
02:16:34 Gabe do you want to
02:16:36 feel that one
02:16:38 uh well
02:16:40 not
02:16:42 from the inside
02:16:44 not from the inside
02:16:46 yeah that's a good
02:16:48 I would agree with that answer
02:16:50 um
02:16:52 Andrew Starkey asks
02:16:54 utopian fupor or future
02:16:56 or dystopian future
02:16:58 are you asking which one I would prefer
02:17:00 or which one
02:17:02 yeah dystopia please
02:17:04 dystopia please
02:17:06 I would I don't expect I don't think we're
02:17:08 actually headed for like a super dystopian
02:17:10 unless you think I mean we kind of already live in one
02:17:12 I don't think we do kind of already live
02:17:14 in one I mean depending on
02:17:16 your financial stability
02:17:18 uh living in
02:17:20 like a first world
02:17:22 country may feel like a third
02:17:24 world at the moment if you
02:17:26 don't have a lot that's
02:17:28 social safety nets have been
02:17:30 eh it's not good
02:17:32 it's not I don't think I don't feel
02:17:34 like it's it's necessarily
02:17:36 on like a
02:17:38 guaranteed track
02:17:40 like I think
02:17:42 the thing that's
02:17:44 potentially the most worrying is like
02:17:46 Russia doing a whole cold war
02:17:48 but then actually going through
02:17:50 with a nuke or two
02:17:52 but I don't know that that's any more
02:17:54 likely than it ever has been
02:17:56 yeah
02:17:58 oh god I forgot
02:18:00 about that
02:18:02 I mean he's always saying it
02:18:04 he's saying um
02:18:06 I still have a nukes guys
02:18:08 I could like blow you up
02:18:10 I should be scared of me
02:18:12 I guess if I had nukes I would probably
02:18:14 also do that so I get it
02:18:16 you know when when all you when all
02:18:18 you've got is a nuke everything looks
02:18:20 like a big red button
02:18:22 with a key behind it
02:18:24 yeah if you know what I mean
02:18:26 and then of course climate catastrophe
02:18:28 uh oh sure
02:18:30 sure it's like that's
02:18:32 definitely going to result in
02:18:34 thousands upon thousands of deaths
02:18:36 over the next hundred years
02:18:38 unless I mean even if
02:18:40 I mean changes are made immediately
02:18:42 it's gonna people are gonna be
02:18:44 displaced to the very least
02:18:46 so I don't know
02:18:48 I mean if climate
02:18:50 stuff gets
02:18:52 going I mean over the next hundred
02:18:54 years I mean I would say probably
02:18:56 millions and maybe billions even
02:18:58 depending on like how
02:19:00 severe
02:19:02 yeah I mean even just the heat
02:19:04 waves and like the coming
02:19:06 like cold wave
02:19:08 I guess of winter
02:19:10 like whether in
02:19:12 Europe at least is getting more extreme
02:19:14 so like the hotter times
02:19:16 are gonna be hotter the colder
02:19:18 times are gonna be colder so
02:19:20 if you don't have
02:19:22 the infrastructure you might
02:19:24 just die from
02:19:26 a heat stroke
02:19:28 or die from
02:19:30 being too cold then you can't turn
02:19:32 on your radiator
02:19:34 because it's way too expensive
02:19:36 because of the war
02:19:38 in Ukraine
02:19:40 so you know
02:19:42 I'm expecting
02:19:44 I mean people are predicting
02:19:46 like yeah people are just gonna
02:19:48 freeze to death today
02:19:50 this year there's just gonna be a thing
02:19:52 that will happen a lot
02:19:54 mostly older people
02:19:56 who like don't have people to
02:19:58 oh well okay then
02:20:00 but oh fine
02:20:02 I mean just like
02:20:04 just like covid right like
02:20:06 it's only gonna kill people that are like old
02:20:08 or people that have pre-existing conditions
02:20:10 and like you know so whatever
02:20:12 I mean it happens every year anyway
02:20:14 the older people you know
02:20:16 if they don't have family and they get
02:20:18 snowed in they just
02:20:20 they're just fucked
02:20:22 but like
02:20:24 everyone's
02:20:26 feeling
02:20:28 the energy increases
02:20:30 Vlad I'll never be old or dead
02:20:34 it's hard to be like
02:20:36 just blanketly
02:20:38 oh yeah we're not heading for a dystopia
02:20:40 we're not gonna it's not gonna be terrible
02:20:42 because it definitely is
02:20:44 I mean disasters happen
02:20:46 there's always been
02:20:48 disasters
02:20:50 I think what's gonna happen
02:20:52 is that we're going to just get more
02:20:54 used to whatever
02:20:56 dystopian things are happening
02:20:58 and just continue to not call it a dystopia
02:21:00 because it does feel like that
02:21:02 has already happened a bit
02:21:04 yeah I mean it's happened a lot
02:21:06 yeah
02:21:08 yeah and it'll probably
02:21:10 probably continue to happen
02:21:14 so what I'm saying is so yeah by the time
02:21:16 we get to what we consider a dystopia
02:21:18 now by that point we'll have been
02:21:20 acclimated to it and we'll feel like it's
02:21:22 alright so
02:21:24 so don't worry about it
02:21:26 you're gonna feel
02:21:28 yes I really like you're gonna feel like it's
02:21:30 normal when the time comes
02:21:32 and then you'll be able to like ignore it
02:21:34 and play video games and it'll be fine
02:21:36 that's right that's that's
02:21:38 correct
02:21:40 next one is from never paint
02:21:42 asks Ben are you already
02:21:44 or still awake right now
02:21:46 recording this episode I
02:21:48 answered that at the beginning
02:21:50 yes I woke up early this morning
02:21:52 I slept
02:21:54 woke up a little earlier than yeah I went
02:21:56 to sleep and I woke up very early in the morning
02:21:58 and now I'm awake
02:22:00 um the next one is from
02:22:02 dream man
02:22:03 beescapades conclusion when
02:22:05 I crave it
02:22:07 uh yeah I do want to finish
02:22:09 beescapades obviously it has been a while
02:22:11 since I did anything with it and I
02:22:13 would have to
02:22:15 kind of pick it up again and figure out
02:22:17 where I left it off
02:22:19 kind of the same as the Winnie the Pooh
02:22:21 retrospective that's something that I want
02:22:23 to pick up at some point but only after
02:22:25 like other more pressing
02:22:27 matters are dealt with
02:22:29 I would probably do the Winnie the Pooh
02:22:31 one first because that one is not
02:22:33 gonna take as long
02:22:35 because it's easier
02:22:37 so yeah at some point
02:22:39 in the not too distant future I hope to have
02:22:41 this video done
02:22:43 and the slime and punishment kick
02:22:45 starter underway
02:22:47 and then maybe after the kick
02:22:49 starter is over at that point maybe
02:22:51 I'll be like well nothing to do but
02:22:53 finish my Winnie the Pooh retrospective
02:22:55 and then when that's done well nothing
02:22:57 else but might as well finish
02:22:59 beescapades that's
02:23:01 kind of the plan
02:23:05 and then the next this is the last one we've got
02:23:07 is from CJ who says
02:23:09 when is the next oops all
02:23:11 guests
02:23:13 uh well it's never
02:23:15 any plan to do multiple
02:23:17 definitely there why would you
02:23:19 why would you want there to be another one
02:23:21 it was a
02:23:23 clusterfuck it was unbelievable
02:23:25 it took me all week to organize
02:23:27 that and I don't
02:23:29 yeah I don't want to do
02:23:31 another one it was really hard and the results
02:23:33 I mean it was fun I guess but the
02:23:35 results were not worth it
02:23:37 we're not worth how hard
02:23:39 it was to make it happen is what I'm saying
02:23:43 um so it was an experiment
02:23:45 and it was a successful experiment
02:23:47 and that I successfully obtained the information
02:23:49 that I needed and that information
02:23:51 was that I should not do another
02:23:53 one
02:23:55 yeah an experiment where
02:23:57 like is this a stupid idea
02:23:59 oh conclusive
02:24:01 yes
02:24:03 yes it was
02:24:05 if anyone could have told you
02:24:07 so beforehand but now we have proven it
02:24:09 with science
02:24:11 uh and that's it
02:24:13 that's the end
02:24:15 of the voice of well
02:24:17 end of the ask
02:24:19 things
02:24:21 I will
02:24:23 yeah after I move
02:24:25 I will try and set about
02:24:29 fixing fixing the voicemail
02:24:31 box among other things
02:24:33 I would also hope
02:24:35 to maybe have better internet in my new place
02:24:37 so maybe we could stream a little more successfully
02:24:39 after that
02:24:41 so that's sure yeah
02:24:43 so that's I like to try that again
02:24:45 when I'm in my new place with more rely
02:24:47 hopefully with more reliable internet
02:24:53 yeah I'm gonna be
02:24:55 slowly working
02:24:57 on the Clarissa and I'll get those
02:24:59 commissions done
02:25:01 um
02:25:03 potentially we'll go back
02:25:05 to streaming Elden Ring
02:25:07 I was reminded obviously
02:25:09 last time Never Paint wants to see it
02:25:11 I'm like yeah people did like it
02:25:13 I was just maybe streaming
02:25:15 too much
02:25:17 or like at
02:25:19 irregular times
02:25:21 but I feel like if I made an announcement
02:25:23 I'd be like yeah
02:25:25 a little stream
02:25:27 people come back have a look
02:25:29 I do want to
02:25:31 beat the game on stream
02:25:33 I feel like some amount of
02:25:35 completion would be fun
02:25:37 how far through it are you
02:25:39 I
02:25:41 have got
02:25:43 to
02:25:45 the
02:25:47 the capital city
02:25:49 the capital city
02:25:51 but there are places beyond
02:25:53 that I've not seen yet
02:25:55 I think a snowy place
02:25:57 where you can eat whatever buses in the city
02:25:59 and then move towards that
02:26:01 and explore that
02:26:03 how much
02:26:05 of what you've played of it
02:26:07 have you done on stream versus off
02:26:09 from my
02:26:11 character everything has been
02:26:13 on stream
02:26:15 the only things I've done off stream
02:26:17 were like
02:26:19 doing buses that I've already done before
02:26:21 but like with
02:26:23 like being summoned by my brothers
02:26:25 so just be like
02:26:27 helping them with their character
02:26:29 which has been nice
02:26:35 should
02:26:37 part of me wants to play Elden Ring
02:26:39 and part of me
02:26:41 is a dozen I don't know
02:26:43 I was interested for a while and I said
02:26:45 I'll get around to playing it
02:26:47 now I'm a little more like should I
02:26:51 I don't know
02:26:53 it's gonna be there you just save it for when you're like
02:26:55 you know what I have a hankering for
02:26:57 of souls
02:26:59 like gameplay
02:27:03 and this one has
02:27:05 so much of it I'll get it
02:27:07 I'll play this one
02:27:09 just do it on a hunch
02:27:11 do it on a whim
02:27:13 okay
02:27:15 I guess that's a good advice
02:27:19 alright
02:27:21 any I mean
02:27:23 trying to think if there's
02:27:25 anything else I want to say
02:27:27 before we wrap up
02:27:31 what are we going for
02:27:33 2 hours and 30 minutes actually
02:27:35 feel good about that
02:27:37 I was afraid this might be a really short one
02:27:39 because no voicemails and so on
02:27:43 we can talk about
02:27:45 usually a voicemail
02:27:47 prompts a discussion so if a question
02:27:49 does the same thing it's about
02:27:51 it's gonna be about the same time spent
02:27:53 that's true
02:27:55 but we get more voicemails than we get
02:27:57 askpcp responses
02:27:59 I guess that's the truth
02:28:01 people should follow us on twitter
02:28:03 people should follow us on twitter
02:28:05 also I should remove the old
02:28:07 pinned post and
02:28:09 I'll make the
02:28:11 oh no I can't make the ben commentary
02:28:13 the pinned post because
02:28:15 I tweeted it from my account
02:28:17 you fool
02:28:19 I need to just make an identical tweet
02:28:21 yeah that's true
02:28:27 alright well I guess
02:28:29 if we're done I'm gonna
02:28:31 go open my curtains and see what sort of
02:28:35 seems like the light outside is a little dim
02:28:37 I'm wondering if it's a little cloudy at the moment
02:28:39 so
02:28:41 I'll just have to
02:28:43 try and set up, I think I'm just gonna try and
02:28:45 take what I've got and set up the best
02:28:47 shot I can manage to make
02:28:49 and then
02:28:51 if I get that
02:28:53 figured out and I feel like then I'm just
02:28:55 gonna go I'm just gonna start filming
02:28:57 that's my plan for the day
02:28:59 hell yeah
02:29:01 and I don't know how long it's gonna take me
02:29:03 you filmed that
02:29:05 content
02:29:07 content baby are you ready for
02:29:09 content oh my god what if it's
02:29:11 bad what if I film it and I'm like this was terrible
02:29:13 this was awful nobody wants to see this
02:29:15 no
02:29:17 what if I film it
02:29:19 then you
02:29:21 look at it and if you hate it you film it again
02:29:23 do a different
02:29:25 what if I film it
02:29:27 and then I
02:29:29 delete it and then I don't show
02:29:31 anyone and then I get pink pill
02:29:33 Biden pink pills me and I go trans
02:29:35 and then I'm like I'm rebranding my channel
02:29:37 and I'm gonna delete
02:29:39 this video instead of post it
02:29:41 what do we think
02:29:43 what do we think about that
02:29:45 I would support your every move
02:29:47 thank you
02:29:49 I was it that was a test
02:29:51 and you pass
02:29:53 um
02:29:55 I guess I yeah I guess
02:29:57 then I could I could I could
02:29:59 I could just record it I could just record it then there
02:30:01 would be no reason why I do that's why
02:30:03 it was yeah that's true that's actually true
02:30:05 because it's just you I feel
02:30:07 like I don't know part of me thinks
02:30:09 that like
02:30:11 if I re-recorded it
02:30:13 a second time
02:30:15 like it like if for some reason
02:30:17 I was not happy with how it came out the first time
02:30:19 and I recorded it again I wonder
02:30:21 if
02:30:23 like the sort of like
02:30:25 improvisational I haven't done
02:30:27 this before
02:30:29 quality would be lost and that
02:30:31 would be bad like it would be like more
02:30:33 flat and boring
02:30:35 in its delivery or
02:30:37 would it be better
02:30:39 because I'd be more practiced at it and I'd be more
02:30:41 confident in what I was saying
02:30:43 I think it would be better
02:30:45 I mean even if like you come up with
02:30:47 something off the cuff
02:30:49 that's pretty good
02:30:51 you can just say it again
02:30:53 you can deliver it
02:30:55 try to deliver the same way if that's
02:30:57 if that's easy to do
02:30:59 I think when it comes to like
02:31:01 off the cuff conversations
02:31:03 that's impossible to like properly recreate
02:31:05 because the reaction timing
02:31:07 with the other person
02:31:09 is hard to like pull off the same way
02:31:11 yeah
02:31:13 so you just have to do a different version of it
02:31:15 where everyone knows that it's been done before
02:31:17 but they're just saying it
02:31:19 damn well I mean
02:31:21 that raises a
02:31:23 I'll call it a paradox
02:31:25 that's like a Zeno's paradox
02:31:27 because then in theory
02:31:29 if I were to
02:31:31 record it once
02:31:33 it's not good enough
02:31:35 and then I re-recorded it again
02:31:37 and that improved it
02:31:39 like if that made it better
02:31:41 what if I then was like okay
02:31:43 but if I record it again
02:31:45 it'll be even better
02:31:47 I'll be even more confident
02:31:49 even more practiced
02:31:51 and then it's like okay
02:31:53 every time I record it
02:31:55 every time I redo it
02:31:57 it would get better and better and better
02:31:59 I don't think it necessarily gets better
02:32:01 next
02:32:03 yeah
02:32:05 they dissolve away
02:32:07 and you're left with
02:32:09 the refined metal
02:32:11 in theory I can just edit them out
02:32:13 my hope is that
02:32:15 in editing those things will be removed anyway
02:32:17 sure
02:32:19 um
02:32:21 I mean
02:32:23 it depends on if you have something
02:32:25 to cut to or if you're gonna do like a jump cut
02:32:27 or just go closer
02:32:29 what's the thing people do?
02:32:31 they cut
02:32:33 out like a pause
02:32:35 or a flub
02:32:37 move the camera closer
02:32:39 but like zoom in
02:32:41 it's the same shot
02:32:43 it's different enough visually
02:32:45 that you don't notice that there was a cut in time
02:32:47 hmm
02:32:49 yeah I see
02:32:51 I'm not a
02:32:53 particular practice editor
02:32:55 but I'm gonna do my best
02:32:57 my damn best
02:32:59 alright
02:33:01 but I guess we're done with the episode
02:33:03 yeah
02:33:05 and it's only
02:33:07 it's only 1.30pm for me
02:33:09 it is 8.30am
02:33:11 for me and the sun
02:33:13 the sun is out so
02:33:15 this is good
02:33:17 dammit I could have started even earlier
02:33:19 well I wouldn't have been awake
02:33:21 I wouldn't I only just
02:33:23 managed to get everything ready
02:33:25 I just kept the episode short
02:33:27 should have insisted on a 2 hour episode
02:33:29 oh well

02:34:17 goodbye
02:34:19 goodbye
02:34:23 okay
02:34:25 we'll have to edit this back in
02:34:27 to the end but we got a last
02:34:29 minute question just now
02:34:31 so the question was from white poop
02:34:33 misogynered
02:34:35 and I'm still recording
02:34:37 he said
02:34:53 after he detects them
02:34:57 I
02:34:59 I don't know
02:35:01 if
02:35:03 I mean it's a pretty simple answer
02:35:07 pretty simple answer to that maybe it wasn't clear
02:35:09 in reading it but
02:35:11 those buffs are
02:35:13 too strong
02:35:15 even though
02:35:17 disrupt can cancel more powerful
02:35:19 higher level magic than itself
02:35:21 like it's easier to disrupt magic
02:35:23 than it is to
02:35:25 do it
02:35:27 but this is like too much
02:35:29 Damian's like a pretty good wizard
02:35:31 but
02:35:33 and even though disrupt is a pretty simple spell
02:35:35 but even so
02:35:37 it's too far beyond
02:35:39 his ability
02:35:41 even to disrupt it
02:35:43 let alone to cast it
02:35:45 and that's it
02:35:47 thanks
02:35:49 thanks for the question
02:35:51 okay I didn't really have anything to say about it
02:35:53 okay
02:35:55 sorry I could have just done that myself
