00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:13 Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators. As I move my microphone and I move my mouse,
00:00:20 I realize that the Who Are These Podcast guy was absolutely right. My mouse is right next to my microphone.
00:00:29 I basically do have my mic right directly on my mouse, so recording the loud sounds of my mouse clicking.
00:00:36 Honestly, it's not even exaggeration. That guy really had me pegged.
00:00:41 I guess I don't hear it because Discord has a default noise gate for little things like that.
00:00:49 But no, it's like inches away from my microphone, so I'm sure it is audible.
00:01:00 What's up? Once again, a week has passed.
00:01:05 Oh my god.
00:01:07 What the fuck? Nothing even happened.
00:01:13 Well, I had a thing that happened, but it's not the story of an adventure, but it's hard to tell without it being just me reciting a list of things that happened.
00:01:27 I went to Canterbury and it was nice. It was a nice day out.
00:01:33 What's there to do in Canterbury?
00:01:37 Nothing much. It's an old sort of medieval English town. There's like bricks, there's like old walls from castles occasionally just strewn around.
00:01:52 And it's like, yeah, it's nice. We found a cool museum there and they had bagpuss in it.
00:02:00 Oh, right, bagpuss, right.
00:02:02 And the clangers and noggin the nog and Ivor the engine and Rupert Bear.
00:02:08 These can't be real. They're so real.
00:02:12 You're making at least some of these up.
00:02:14 No, no, I actually remembered them all. There was one or two I hadn't ever seen before.
00:02:20 And then there was Basil Brush, the fucks. I didn't know Basil Brush.
00:02:24 Who could forget Basil Brush?
00:02:26 Who could forget? Ha, ha, ha, ha, boom, boom, the classic catchphrase of Basil Brush.
00:02:32 Is that true? I don't know.
00:02:34 He goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, boom, boom, like it's so silly and obnoxious.
00:02:40 But I remember watching it like a, I don't know if it was late 90s or 2000s or whatever.
00:02:47 They had like a Basil Brush came back for a TV show and that's where I knew about him.
00:02:53 Like a revival?
00:02:54 Yeah, because I had no idea that he was like in the, in the olden times, in the 60s,
00:03:00 when he was first invented as a little cartoon fucks.
00:03:04 I asked you about...
00:03:06 Anybody remember Basil Brush?
00:03:08 Wait, so Basil Brush...
00:03:10 So, okay, so Bagpuss was like a show and these were all characters in the show, right?
00:03:14 As we were talking about.
00:03:15 Bagpuss, well, these, this was all in one room in the museum, which was like this particular artist,
00:03:22 puppeteer, craftsman, animator, stop motion guy.
00:03:27 And these are all shows that he worked on or created.
00:03:30 So Bagpuss was one, Basil Brush was another,
00:03:33 Nog in the Nog, which was, I think, a Viking.
00:03:36 But it was like two dimensional, like South Park, but not like South Park.
00:03:44 Paper cutouts, but with like hinges on their arms and legs and they would walk.
00:03:49 It's like, you know how the old Norman tapestries that would depict medieval people?
00:03:59 Yes.
00:04:00 They sort of have a weird...
00:04:01 From the side, from the side view, because they didn't know how to draw a person in three quarters view.
00:04:07 Yeah, so they, it was like a show based on that sort of way of doing things.
00:04:13 Yeah, cool.
00:04:14 They've got all the, like the original puppets, the original little paper people.
00:04:19 They got everything.
00:04:21 And I was like, we had no idea any of that was there.
00:04:24 We were just like, oh, that's a cool building.
00:04:25 Let's go inside.
00:04:27 And we saw it.
00:04:29 That reminds me of, do you know a YouTube channel called Atrocity Guide?
00:04:35 Nope.
00:04:36 Atrocity Guide is a pretty cool channel.
00:04:38 They have a bunch of videos that are about weird, just kind of about weird things.
00:04:44 Like there's one about, I hope I remember the name.
00:04:48 It's called The Throne of Fred Hampton.
00:04:53 Okay, you've probably seen the Down the Rabbit Hole about Henry Darger and Realms of the Unreal.
00:05:01 No, I have not watched Down the Rabbit Hole before.
00:05:06 I see them, but I'm like, eh, whatever.
00:05:08 That's my favorite Down the Rabbit Hole, Henry Darger and The Realms of the Unreal.
00:05:13 It's about a guy who worked as a janitor his whole life, but his whole life he spent
00:05:20 cutting out magazine clippings and tracing over them to create this huge volume of illustrated stories
00:05:30 about these, I think it's like seven twin, seven sisters who were like princesses of this magical, like, other world.
00:05:39 It's awesome.
00:05:41 And yeah, I think it was, I think it was Sporktown Heroine that turned me on to this channel.
00:05:47 She recommended me a video called, huh?
00:05:50 No, nothing.
00:05:51 Oh, called The Throne of Fred Hampton.
00:05:53 And it's a similar thing.
00:05:54 This guy, Fred Hampton, who I think might have also been a, maybe not a janitor, maybe like a garbage collector or something,
00:06:01 but yeah, he had this little like warehouse space or like a storage unit.
00:06:05 And in the storage unit, he spent years collecting trash, like aluminum foil and light bulbs,
00:06:12 and he would take any piece of like glittery or like reflective or shiny trash that he found,
00:06:18 and he would make it into, he would form it into a piece of this throne
00:06:24 and all this like, this like royal like, like adornments to go along with like, he built this throne room
00:06:32 out of like aluminum foil and light bulbs in this storage unit.
00:06:36 And I guess he thought he was like a prophet who was possessed by God.
00:06:40 No, it's not that he, he didn't think he was a prophet, but he did think he was tasked by God to build a throne like for like the return of Christ.
00:06:48 Or something to like ascend to.
00:06:50 It's so cool.
00:06:52 And then this, hold on.
00:06:57 A glittery room in a storage unit wouldn't surely, I mean, obviously that's probably just what they had.
00:07:05 But like, you can't see the glitteriness if there's no light shining in.
00:07:11 Well, I mean, there was a light, eternal light bulb on.
00:07:15 I think I remember he brought like a woman over and he was like, hey, check this out.
00:07:20 And like he just, he went in and just turned the lights on.
00:07:23 And like the lady was like, oh my God, what the fuck is this?
00:07:30 But yeah, anyway, there's an atrocity guide.
00:07:35 I think it just came out and it was about this, I'd never heard of this before.
00:07:40 Russian cartoonist making a, he's been working on a movie for like 15 years.
00:07:47 Well, it's him and his wife, they're like a pair.
00:07:50 So yeah, these two Russian animators have been making this movie.
00:07:53 It's called the, it's called like, is it like the cloak or like the coat, the overcoat, I think.
00:08:03 But it's, okay, you know that when you think of like old Russian cartoons, you think of like, yeah, like,
00:08:09 like sort of South Parkish, like like paper puppets, right?
00:08:12 That like kind of move on hinges.
00:08:15 Yeah.
00:08:16 They sort of look like the Monty Python cartoons.
00:08:20 Well, it's like that, but it's like the most complicated form of that you can imagine.
00:08:26 It's like that, but with like every individual like finger of like the hand is like hinged and like it's all,
00:08:35 it's not like flat colors.
00:08:37 It's like, it's all like painterly.
00:08:39 And like they do like, you know, 20 different images of the same like face or whatever at different angles.
00:08:46 And so as the guy turns his head like they're replaced, they're moving it slightly between frames,
00:08:50 but they're also replacing it with a slit to make it like a smooth.
00:08:53 It's so weird looking.
00:08:55 It's bizarre.
00:08:56 Honestly, this guy has been making this move.
00:09:00 These people have been making this movie for like 15 years.
00:09:03 It's never, it's probably never going to be finished.
00:09:06 This is just going to be the rest of their life finishing this movie and never actually doing it.
00:09:10 And I got to say, it's an admirable work, but it looks scary.
00:09:17 It looks scary and creepy and unsettling and uncanny and I don't like it.
00:09:22 I just don't like it.
00:09:24 What's it called?
00:09:26 I believe the movie is called The Overcoat.
00:09:30 Let me look up Atrocity Guide and make sure.
00:09:35 Atrocity Guide.
00:09:39 The newest video is called...
00:09:42 Okay, it's called The Animators who've spent 40 years on a single film.
00:09:46 Maybe in the description it has a...
00:09:49 Yeah, it's called The Overcoat.
00:09:52 Like there's clips that have been shown of it.
00:09:55 I mean, the whole, the movie, it's not done yet.
00:09:59 They've made other...
00:10:01 They've made other animation work, like to fund the project.
00:10:07 You know, I guess they are...
00:10:10 I guess they like the Russian style of, you know, like paper puppet animation.
00:10:16 And they're basically doing like taking that to its logical conclusion, doing like the most advanced form of that a person can do.
00:10:23 And I guess that's fair enough.
00:10:25 But I truly feel that the resulting product is horrifying.
00:10:34 I want to see it.
00:10:36 It's hard to Google.
00:10:38 Let me...
00:10:40 Oh, Jesus.
00:10:43 I just clicked to like a random point in the...
00:10:48 Okay.
00:10:51 Okay, okay, okay.
00:10:53 A clip of the movie.
00:10:57 I'll sort of find you the exact...
00:10:59 I'll find you the exact timestamp.
00:11:02 Here.
00:11:05 Okay, share.
00:11:07 Start at 25.09.
00:11:09 Here's just like a little clip of...
00:11:15 Oh, yeah, there's something...
00:11:19 There's something uncanny about the fluidness of that hand movement.
00:11:25 I think it's...
00:11:27 I mean, I think it's part...
00:11:29 I don't know if it's entirely the animation style.
00:11:31 I mean, I think the illustration style, like the way that he's drawn is part of what is making it creepy.
00:11:38 And I think it's got to be somewhat intentional.
00:11:41 Like they drew him like that on purpose.
00:11:44 But like, I just hate it.
00:11:46 I hate seeing it.
00:11:49 40 years in a single film.
00:11:52 I said 15.
00:11:55 I guess I meant 40.
00:11:56 Yeah, they've been...
00:11:58 They made another...
00:12:00 There's one about like a fox stealing a baby.
00:12:03 And they made that movie like...
00:12:07 I guess it's based on a myth or something.
00:12:09 And they made that like, you know, 40 years ago and it was a big hit.
00:12:13 And they were like, well, for our next one, we're going to adapt this piece of folk literature called the Overcoat.
00:12:20 And that's what they've been doing for 40 years.
00:12:24 Crazy.
00:12:25 Yeah, I know.
00:12:26 The dedication alone is inspiring, but also I would never want to do that one thing for 40 years.
00:12:36 Later on in the video, she says like, it seems like the guy just sort of is like a weird misanthrope
00:12:44 and kind of just doesn't care like what people think of his movie.
00:12:48 And he's just doing it to do it at this point.
00:12:50 And it doesn't seem like he's in any hurry to like finish it up and get it released.
00:12:55 I mean, why would you...
00:12:56 At this point, it's his life, I guess.
00:12:59 Why would you stop?
00:13:01 Like if somebody says, huh, this has taken a while and doesn't even look good.
00:13:05 It looks creepy.
00:13:06 And it's like, oh, I guess I should can it then 40 years in.
00:13:10 He, it must be, it must be supposed to look like this.
00:13:15 Of course.
00:13:16 But like...
00:13:17 Movies don't have to look beautiful.
00:13:20 They can look fucked up.
00:13:22 I just don't know why you would make it look like this on purpose.
00:13:25 I don't know who would want to see this.
00:13:30 I don't know.
00:13:31 Freaks.
00:13:32 I don't know, man.
00:13:35 I'm...
00:13:36 I...
00:13:37 God, not...
00:13:38 Jeez.
00:13:39 Art enjoyers.
00:13:40 Art enjoyer.
00:13:41 The average, the average Russian paper, paper doll style of animation enjoyer.
00:13:50 The soy jack.
00:13:52 I don't know.
00:13:54 Anime connoisseur.
00:13:56 Anime freak.
00:13:58 Something, something, something, something, something, haha, good, bad.
00:14:06 Anyway, what were we talking about?
00:14:09 I was talking about the museum in Canterbury.
00:14:13 Right, right, right, right, right, right.
00:14:15 Yeah, I asked you about that on the Shekels for Hekels because I was not familiar with
00:14:19 any of these characters.
00:14:21 Yeah.
00:14:23 The reason I don't really feel like it's worth, like a story worth telling is because there
00:14:28 wasn't really anything particularly exciting that happened.
00:14:32 It was just like a nice day and like if we went to the seaside, we saw the sunset over
00:14:37 the sea as it receded into the ocean.
00:14:40 And it was really nice, but it's like, I can't really describe it in a way that anyone could
00:14:44 really get anything out of it.
00:14:46 Yesterday, I saw the moon, right?
00:14:50 I know, but it was really low over the horizon.
00:14:54 It was really low and it was so like yellow.
00:14:57 It was like orange.
00:14:59 It was the orangeest moon I've ever seen.
00:15:02 It looked very spooky.
00:15:05 I missed the lunar eclipse.
00:15:07 There was a lunar eclipse like this weekend, I think, but it was cloudy.
00:15:11 I couldn't see it.
00:15:13 Bummer.
00:15:16 Oh, well.
00:15:18 Oh, well.
00:15:20 Guess I'm fucked.
00:15:22 Oh, you know, another thing is the only sort of interesting thing, but it's like I'm mostly
00:15:29 interested in how many people in our audience who are British remember this one thing.
00:15:36 Me and my brothers, we have this in-joke that started from Michael Owen, who is a footballer
00:15:48 who plays football.
00:15:50 Who is this guy?
00:15:52 Michael Owen.
00:15:54 Oh, okay.
00:15:56 And the reason he's a meme, like an in-joke, is because we had a cereal box where it was
00:16:05 Michael Owen themed shreddies or something.
00:16:08 It was a shreddies box and Michael Owen was on the front.
00:16:11 He was hot shit.
00:16:13 He was like David Beckham, but at the same time, it was like Michael Owen and David Beckham,
00:16:18 but David Beckham was more famous for longer lasting and Michael Owen, nobody remembers him.
00:16:24 But Michael Owen was on there.
00:16:26 He's like, cool, the sports guy.
00:16:29 I don't know why we had this cereal.
00:16:32 There was this how Michael Owen eats shreddies, like how to eat shreddies with Michael Owen.
00:16:38 Are shreddies like Wheaties?
00:16:40 Yeah, yeah, very similar.
00:16:43 So there was a four, it was four pals, I remember, and it's like step one.
00:16:50 Wait a minute.
00:16:51 Wait a minute.
00:16:52 I Googled shreddies and I do see the cereal box, but there is also apparently a line of
00:17:00 underwear and other fabric goods that are designed to filter your farts and make them smell better.
00:17:07 That is also called shreddies.
00:17:09 Well, that's very unfortunate.
00:17:12 I don't like that I know that now.
00:17:14 The original shreddies, they claim.
00:17:19 Well, the underwear?
00:17:21 That's what their website says.
00:17:25 I just wanted to know.
00:17:28 Now I can't help but picture fighting through a piece of cereal.
00:17:32 I kind of don't believe them.
00:17:33 I think they're lying.
00:17:34 I think that probably the cereal came first.
00:17:37 But what do I know?
00:17:39 I mean, it's like a grid, a lattice grid.
00:17:42 Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at it.
00:17:45 Anyway, there was like celebrities being on cereal wasn't that strange.
00:17:52 But the thing that was funny was the how to eat shreddies or shredded wheat or whatever it was.
00:17:58 Yeah, I've always wondered, Michael Owen, how do I eat shreddies exactly?
00:18:03 Yeah, and it was like panel one, like put spoon in to bowl.
00:18:10 Panel two, lift spoon.
00:18:14 Panel three, exercise taste buds.
00:18:17 And then panel four, repeat.
00:18:20 And I found it so funny because at no point does he put the cereal in his mouth.
00:18:25 If you follow those steps exactly, you lift the spoon up out of the bowl.
00:18:32 You put it in, lift it up, just move your mouth around a bit and then do it again.
00:18:37 You'll die of starvation.
00:18:39 And it was so stupid and me and my brothers laughed forever.
00:18:45 We've laughed until 2021 about fucking Michael Owen.
00:18:48 And now whenever we want to think of someone who's an idiot, a stupid character.
00:18:54 We think of someone who's an idiot.
00:18:56 Whenever we have like a stupid character for something that like, oh, what if, I don't know,
00:19:04 what if you had a grape that could tell a time, you know, Michael Owen, brand grape.
00:19:10 We would just put Michael Owen there.
00:19:12 It's very stupid.
00:19:13 It's very in-jokey.
00:19:14 But I'm really curious as to if anybody remembers Michael Owen's How to Eat Shreddies from the back of that cereal box.
00:19:23 Comment below.
00:19:25 Please comment below if you remember Michael Owen's How to Eat Shreddies.
00:19:30 I mean, do you Google it?
00:19:32 I Googled it.
00:19:34 All right.
00:19:35 Here's one of the images.
00:19:37 This is what he looks like.
00:19:38 So open your mouth or like whatever.
00:19:42 Back, I think, I think this is like an edited photograph.
00:19:46 They put the word back in there because that's the back button of their website about...
00:19:50 Okay, okay.
00:19:51 Are you sure it was Shreddies because I'm seeing it on a box of sporties?
00:19:55 Another cereal that sounds ridiculous to me.
00:19:58 I think that was like a version of the thing.
00:20:01 Nestle is the same company.
00:20:03 Nestle Shredded Wheats.
00:20:05 I don't think it was Shredded Wheat.
00:20:06 It's not quite the same product.
00:20:08 This looks more like, this is Shredded Wheat.
00:20:11 Does it sort of look more like Chex?
00:20:15 I don't know.
00:20:16 Yeah.
00:20:17 I guess Shredded Wheat was like the original one, but then to make it cool for the kids,
00:20:21 they made Shreddies.
00:20:23 And that was the one I know more of.
00:20:26 It's got more sugar on it.
00:20:27 But yeah, Michael Owen, I found this one image.
00:20:31 I can't find the rest.
00:20:33 Like Shreddies How to...
00:20:36 Like it's so stupid and nobody would keep track of it.
00:20:40 Except for this one website that seems to have images of the old Michael Owen box.
00:20:49 When I Google this, all the results are him not on a Shreddies box, but on a sporties box.
00:20:55 Are you sure you're not misremembering what cereal it was?
00:20:58 Well, Shredded Wheat.
00:21:00 It was like a limited time version.
00:21:03 It's like, oh, Lucky Charms, but with only nothing in it.
00:21:09 And you call it Shitty Charms.
00:21:12 It's the different name for the same cereal, but branded with a celebrity.
00:21:17 I'm looking at it.
00:21:18 I can tell that Shredded Wheat is not the same thing as Shreddies.
00:21:21 Okay, we had Shredded Wheat.
00:21:22 I mean, it's very similar.
00:21:24 Yes, I made a mistake, whatever.
00:21:26 But that's what it was.
00:21:28 Michael Owen on Shredded Something.
00:21:31 Wait, well, hmm.
00:21:34 Wait, I found a...
00:21:37 Damn it.
00:21:39 I don't think this is it.
00:21:42 But I found some box images.
00:21:44 Maybe this is just a different box, actually.
00:21:51 Here's some important imagery for all of us to remember on Christmas Day.
00:22:02 Here's another one.
00:22:04 But here, I'm about to show my favorite one, which is...
00:22:09 Oh, there's more.
00:22:11 There's more.
00:22:13 You found more?
00:22:15 Well, there's these three boxes.
00:22:18 And then there's three front cover boxes.
00:22:24 But what I like most about this last one here is in the bottom right corner.
00:22:29 Or sorry, the bottom left.
00:22:31 What is this power zone?
00:22:33 It's like new Shreddies with power zone.
00:22:37 Yeah, if you want to be good at sports, you need the power zone Shredded Wheat.
00:22:43 What does this have? Cheese inside of it? What is that?
00:22:46 No, it was just a layer of sugar.
00:22:50 It looks like cheese.
00:22:52 It looks like maybe honey, something or other.
00:22:56 I don't know.
00:22:57 But it's got the...
00:22:59 These Sporties have the power zone.
00:23:02 Oh my God, I found it.
00:23:04 Really? Which? Where?
00:23:07 Open image. I just need to...
00:23:09 It's on Reddit.
00:23:11 I'll just copy paste.
00:23:16 Oh my God.
00:23:19 Michael Owen's morning workout.
00:23:22 Anyway, yeah, here's how to eat the fucking cereal.
00:23:26 The winner's way to start your day.
00:23:29 You lift your arm, you stretch your mouth, and you don't eat it.
00:23:34 Yeah, you don't actually put it in your mouth.
00:23:39 It's such a bizarre thing to include.
00:23:42 And he's just so boring looking.
00:23:47 Yeah, he seems totally uninterested.
00:23:51 He's...
00:23:53 Oh my God.
00:23:59 This is like a magazine or something, man.
00:24:02 Yeah, and the Beano, that's probably what it was.
00:24:05 The Beano?
00:24:07 Yeah, the Beano's a comic book.
00:24:11 Oh.
00:24:12 Like a weekly comic book with cartoon people.
00:24:17 It looks like a wiki-how.
00:24:19 Those wiki-how illustrations?
00:24:21 Yeah, a little bit.
00:24:22 Yeah.
00:24:24 How to eat sporties.
00:24:27 I don't know.
00:24:29 Stupid.
00:24:30 Fucking Michael Owen.
00:24:32 The diagram for exercise taste buds is like a circular motion.
00:24:35 You're meant to rotate the cereal through your...
00:24:40 over the tongue, and then under the tongue, and then back and forth,
00:24:43 back and forth in a circular kind of motion.
00:24:46 The last image is the same as the first one,
00:24:50 but it's ever so slightly smaller.
00:24:53 Yeah, it is.
00:24:55 Yeah.
00:24:57 Oh, I love that I found this.
00:25:01 Well, now I know how to eat sporties, shreddies.
00:25:05 It probably works for any cereal, honestly.
00:25:08 Yeah.
00:25:09 So as long as you have the winner's spirit inside.
00:25:13 Base.
00:25:14 Well, now I know.
00:25:15 Thanks, Michael Owen.
00:25:17 Thanks, Michael Owen.
00:25:21 Speaking of...
00:25:23 Speaking of Michael Owen.
00:25:25 Speaking of athleticism.
00:25:27 Speaking of being fit and powerful.
00:25:32 So I've been continuing to lift and become extremely strong.
00:25:39 And I hit my PB.
00:25:41 I hit my personal best on the bench press this week, 160.
00:25:46 Nothing too impressive, but it's pretty good for me.
00:25:49 So that's pretty cool.
00:25:52 Kazi and Munchy are also PBing.
00:25:55 Kazi is hitting their PBs on, I think, the overhead press
00:26:00 and maybe the bench press and maybe the squat too, I think.
00:26:04 So they're powerful also, which is nice.
00:26:07 But this week, every time I went over there, they were like,
00:26:13 Ben, after we get done lifting, let's get drunk.
00:26:16 Let's get drunk.
00:26:18 I was like, and I'm like, no, no, you're terrible.
00:26:21 You're terrible.
00:26:22 You're a terrible influence.
00:26:24 Friday, I said.
00:26:25 We'll get drunk on Friday.
00:26:26 And we said, okay, we'll get drunk on Friday.
00:26:28 And then the Friday comes and then they're sick.
00:26:31 Everyone's sick.
00:26:32 Munchy gets sick and then Kazi gets sick.
00:26:34 And now I'm probably going to get sick because I probably got
00:26:36 whatever they got.
00:26:38 So that's that shit.
00:26:40 Speaking of being sick, I think I said last week my dad got the
00:26:45 coronavirus.
00:26:46 Did I mention that last week or was that the...
00:26:48 That may have been during the stream.
00:26:50 The stream.
00:26:51 Oh yeah, my dad got the test positive for the coronavirus,
00:26:54 which made me very worried.
00:26:57 But he says he's not, he's got no symptoms.
00:27:00 And he said, I haven't talked to him in a few days,
00:27:03 but I haven't heard anything.
00:27:05 So probably nothing, hopefully nothing has happened there.
00:27:09 He said, he suspected it might be a false positive.
00:27:14 So he said he was going to get tested again.
00:27:17 And we'll see.
00:27:20 And I mentioned this on the stream, but I'll say it again.
00:27:23 I felt, I felt sad because it was his birthday this weekend.
00:27:27 And I had planned to go visit him as like a surprise.
00:27:30 Like, hey, I'm here to hang out for your birthday.
00:27:33 But then he got tested positive for the coronavirus.
00:27:36 So we canceled that.
00:27:38 So as not to spread the virus.
00:27:41 So I didn't get to do that, which was kind of shit.
00:27:44 And it would be kind of shitty if it turned out,
00:27:46 oh, it was just a false positive.
00:27:48 I could have gone anyway, but I didn't.
00:27:51 Whoops.
00:27:52 But I mean, I guess Thanksgiving is like this week anyway.
00:27:56 So whatever.
00:27:58 I'll be there either way.
00:28:00 It doesn't matter.
00:28:01 Nothing.
00:28:02 Nothing matters.
00:28:04 I hope it is a false positive.
00:28:06 So I don't have to worry about catching it.
00:28:09 Yes.
00:28:10 That would be helpful.
00:28:11 That would be optimal.
00:28:13 Yeah.
00:28:15 Yeah.
00:28:17 Oh, by the way, for, for my adventure,
00:28:20 there was a lot of walking involved.
00:28:22 And it's my first big Pikmin bloom outing.
00:28:27 Oh, God.
00:28:28 And I got so many nectar.
00:28:30 I got so many flowers bloomed.
00:28:32 Wow.
00:28:33 That sounds incredible.
00:28:34 And guess how many steps that was for that entire day.
00:28:38 For what, for one day walking around in museums and shit.
00:28:41 Walking around in museums and then also walking like to the ocean.
00:28:46 There's quite a lot of walking, really.
00:28:48 Okay, let me think.
00:28:50 At a rate of about one step a second,
00:28:53 let's say a day out is maybe,
00:28:56 if it's a long day, maybe eight hours, right?
00:28:59 So 60, 60 steps a minute times 60 steps is 3,600 steps per hour.
00:29:09 Times eight would be 24, 25,800 steps.
00:29:15 And let's say maybe you were walking for half of it.
00:29:18 So I'm going to guess about 12,000 steps.
00:29:23 Hmm.
00:29:25 Well, well.
00:29:28 There's actually 21,656 steps.
00:29:32 Wow.
00:29:34 Damn.
00:29:35 That was a lot.
00:29:36 My legs hurt quite a lot afterwards.
00:29:38 Because we planned it badly.
00:29:40 We didn't exactly know where we were going.
00:29:42 It was really just sort of like, let's get the fuck out somewhere.
00:29:47 And then we did.
00:29:48 And we had to walk a lot.
00:29:50 We could have got more buses, but we thought,
00:29:52 no, this is an adventure.
00:29:53 We can walk.
00:29:54 We can walk through this forest.
00:29:55 Oh, oh, we can't.
00:29:57 So you were like, you were on like a family trip to Canterbury.
00:30:01 And while you were there, you were like, let's get out.
00:30:03 Let's just go walk around somewhere.
00:30:05 No, no, no, no.
00:30:06 We just, it was just a day trip.
00:30:07 We got on a coach to Canterbury at like 8 a.m.
00:30:11 Just you and your brothers?
00:30:12 Yeah.
00:30:13 Yeah.
00:30:14 And then we explored the town.
00:30:16 We walked through some farms and some woodland on our way north
00:30:22 where the coach was going to pick us up.
00:30:24 That was the plan, generally, is we go to Canterbury,
00:30:26 then we get the coach back in like seven hours.
00:30:30 But we thought like, oh, seven hours, that's plenty of time
00:30:34 to get to a place like, I don't know, one town over.
00:30:38 It's not even that far, like a, you know, whatever.
00:30:42 We're walking there.
00:30:44 And it took a while.
00:30:46 And we had to sort of, we had to take a bus near the end.
00:30:50 To get there.
00:30:51 And it hurt.
00:30:52 Yes.
00:30:53 Mm-hmm.
00:30:54 At least we saw the sea, though.
00:30:56 That was really nice.
00:30:57 Hey, you ever seen the sea?
00:30:59 Oh, of course you have.
00:31:00 You're in Boston.
00:31:01 You see the sea all the time.
00:31:02 I'm in Boston, yeah.
00:31:04 Well, I mean, I see the Charles River all the time,
00:31:07 which is very close to the sea.
00:31:10 I see the sea occasionally.
00:31:13 I've seen the West Coast too, you know, once or twice.
00:31:17 Yeah.
00:31:18 It's something just magical to me about an X,
00:31:23 like a huge flat, no, nothing in your line of vision.
00:31:29 Seeing the ocean just keeps going.
00:31:33 The, you know, if you guys were walking around all day,
00:31:38 does that mean that Henry's leg is better?
00:31:41 Didn't he have like a broken leg for a while?
00:31:43 No.
00:31:44 All right.
00:31:45 Here's the silly thing.
00:31:47 Okay.
00:31:48 Henry has been getting better.
00:31:50 He's on a medication that is, you know, for most of 2020,
00:31:56 he was like, my leg's fucked and I can't get a doctor
00:32:00 because coronavirus, everyone, all the doctors are busy.
00:32:03 Right.
00:32:04 And so his leg got worse and that was really fucked.
00:32:07 Yes.
00:32:08 Now coronavirus has eased up a bit.
00:32:11 He's able to have, he's been able to have more doctors
00:32:18 looking at his leg.
00:32:19 He's got things going on, so it's improving.
00:32:22 And now he has to, it's at the point where he needs
00:32:25 to walk a bit in order to build up strength
00:32:28 because if he's laying still, it's not going to improve.
00:32:33 So he has to do physical therapy for it basically.
00:32:35 Yeah, a little bit of physical therapy.
00:32:37 And we thought, okay, this would be like, you know,
00:32:39 maybe you could come with us on this fun walk.
00:32:45 And that was, I mean, it was kind of his idea.
00:32:47 He wanted to get out of the house.
00:32:49 It was just a lot of walking.
00:32:51 Luckily, we thought this was a stupid idea,
00:32:54 but he brought like a light, like an aluminum metal chair
00:33:02 and he strapped it to a backpack
00:33:04 and he had that carrying around the whole time.
00:33:07 And he had a walking set.
00:33:08 To just say it if you needed to?
00:33:10 Yeah, and we were like, okay, but there's going to be benches.
00:33:13 There's going to be like places where you can sit.
00:33:16 But it was actually very useful because the bus stops
00:33:23 where they had benches that were like anti-homeless benches.
00:33:29 You can't lie down on them.
00:33:31 You sort of slip off them if you, you know, try to relax in any way.
00:33:36 It's basically just like you're supposed to lean up against it
00:33:40 while standing basically.
00:33:42 They're not really seats.
00:33:44 And so when we were waiting for the bus, it's stupid.
00:33:47 I hate it.
00:33:48 It's like a metal cuboid that's slightly tilted downwards.
00:33:57 What?
00:33:58 I've never seen such a thing.
00:34:00 I mean, I've seen anti-homeless benches,
00:34:02 but I've never seen one that's just a slanted cube.
00:34:06 Well, like you got the bus area like a shelter, right?
00:34:11 Oh, wait.
00:34:12 So you're saying that it's basically just sort of like a featureless metal like slab
00:34:16 that just kind of sticks out of the ground
00:34:18 and has like a sort of horizontal surface on top
00:34:21 that you could maybe sit on, but it's angled.
00:34:24 I can kind of picture what you're talking about.
00:34:26 You could slip forward.
00:34:27 Does it have like handles or railings or a back?
00:34:31 It has a back.
00:34:32 It's like, you know, bus stops that have like a back
00:34:35 and then like a roof to keep you out of the rain.
00:34:38 Yes.
00:34:39 It's like one of those with like glass on each side.
00:34:42 And then the bench itself is just a metal cuboid
00:34:47 that's slightly slanted downwards so that you slip off it.
00:34:51 And so he wouldn't have been able to sit on that
00:34:54 for any extended period of time.
00:34:56 So that chair actually did come in handy a few times.
00:35:00 So good idea.
00:35:02 I see.
00:35:04 I see.
00:35:06 Fascinating.
00:35:08 Honestly, really weird.
00:35:10 Our bus stops, I mean, we have benches that are just, you know,
00:35:14 they're benches you can sit on.
00:35:15 Yeah.
00:35:16 Most of our bus stops just don't have a bench in them though.
00:35:18 Most of our bus stops around here are just,
00:35:20 they're just, you know, a little like, you know,
00:35:22 glass and metal shelf you can stand under.
00:35:25 What would you call a bus stop thing like a kiosk?
00:35:30 That's not really it.
00:35:33 Maybe a kiosk, maybe a little...
00:35:38 Oh, this is kind of coming up.
00:35:40 Not a pagoda, I don't know.
00:35:43 Overhang?
00:35:45 No.
00:35:48 You're coming, we've mentioned this before,
00:35:50 but you're planning to come visit in January, right?
00:35:54 Yes, I'll be coming over.
00:35:56 Very cool.
00:35:57 That'll be epic.
00:35:59 It will be a little bit epic.
00:36:01 Okay, I can't find a good image of this.
00:36:05 God dang it.
00:36:09 Are you looking for the bench?
00:36:11 I'm looking for a type of bench that's similar enough,
00:36:14 so I can illustrate what it is,
00:36:17 but these images are like tiny,
00:36:19 I'll post one so you can get a, maybe zoom in.
00:36:22 What?
00:36:24 It's just a little pole.
00:36:26 It's just a little pole and it's sort of slightly angled.
00:36:29 That one in particular, that red one,
00:36:31 that's the London one, those are okay.
00:36:34 You can sort of sit on them.
00:36:36 But the ones that we were at in Canterbury and Whistable,
00:36:40 they sucked.
00:36:42 That's so silly.
00:36:45 Yeah.
00:36:47 Most people just stand next to them,
00:36:49 but you don't even bother.
00:36:51 I could see leaning again.
00:36:53 I could see leaning against it for sure.
00:36:56 Hmm.
00:36:58 That seems like aggressively like,
00:37:00 we're giving you as little bench as we can get away with.
00:37:04 Yeah.
00:37:06 Oh well.
00:37:08 Oh well.
00:37:10 This is billions so they can just not spend it elsewhere.
00:37:16 You know, not to revert the topic,
00:37:19 but I forgot to mention something else about lifting yesterday.
00:37:24 We were doing it and we were in Kazia Munchie's basement
00:37:28 and their boiler, their house boiler that heats the water,
00:37:34 heats their house through radiators,
00:37:37 just started belching steam.
00:37:40 It just started blasting big steam cloud out of a pipe
00:37:44 and it was billowing up into the ceiling
00:37:48 and it heated up the room and it made it all moist and sweaty.
00:37:54 And it was...
00:37:56 Yeah, it was very uncomfortable.
00:37:58 We had to move the bar over to another section of the place
00:38:03 a little further away from all the steam.
00:38:06 And it was very upsetting.
00:38:09 It was very uncomfortable.
00:38:11 It made me very mad,
00:38:14 but we thought we were being poisoned by gas for a minute.
00:38:19 But I went over and I took a big lung...
00:38:21 To test the poison gas theory,
00:38:23 I went over and I took a big lung full of it
00:38:25 and I survived so I was like, no, no, it's steam, it's fine.
00:38:29 I mean, would gas...
00:38:32 Would there even be a gas pipe?
00:38:34 Yeah, it's a standard feature of most boilers in American houses
00:38:39 that there's a big pipe that comes off it
00:38:41 that periodically just emits huge amounts of poisonous gas.
00:38:45 I know the emitting part is not part of it,
00:38:50 but does the house use gas for the stove?
00:38:55 Well, I believe it's an oil-burning boiler, right?
00:39:01 It burns oil to heat the water in the boiler
00:39:04 that then circulates through the radiator system.
00:39:08 So it could have been oil.
00:39:10 Did I mention...
00:39:13 Did I mention that I had a leaky roof?
00:39:16 Did I tell you about this?
00:39:18 Yeah, a couple weeks ago, I forgot to mention it.
00:39:20 Yeah, okay, oh shit, my headphones just got unplugged.
00:39:25 Yeah, a couple, like two weeks ago,
00:39:28 my ceiling in my shitty apartment, it's made of those...
00:39:32 You know, in an office building,
00:39:34 the ceiling might be made of corrugated rectangular tiles
00:39:40 that just kind of fit together.
00:39:42 You know what I mean?
00:39:44 Yeah, a little bit.
00:39:46 Yeah, my roof is made of these corrugated cardboard-y tiles.
00:39:54 Cardboard?
00:39:55 I don't know if they're not actually cardboard,
00:39:57 they're stiffer than that, but they're these cheap tiles.
00:40:01 And one of them over my radiator has kind of a brown stain on it.
00:40:08 Well, and it's sort of bowed out.
00:40:10 Well, from that brown stain bowed out area,
00:40:13 one day I just started hearing a tip, tip, tip, and I look over and yep,
00:40:17 there's just water dripping out of the tile in my ceiling.
00:40:23 So I'm like, oh god, oh my god.
00:40:26 And I put my trash can under it to collect the water.
00:40:29 And I am like, what do I do?
00:40:31 At first I was like, you know what,
00:40:33 maybe I'll just hope that it will go away.
00:40:35 So for one day I waited and was just like,
00:40:38 maybe it just won't happen again.
00:40:40 I think, I actually think, and this is not something I'm sure of,
00:40:45 but I think one time I went, I think I was drunk, I was kind of drunk,
00:40:51 I came home, I woke up, and my face was kind of wet,
00:40:56 and I was like, and my pillow was kind of wet,
00:40:59 and I was like, did I spill something on my pillow?
00:41:02 And in hindsight, I think that maybe the ceiling was dripping on my face,
00:41:06 and I just didn't notice.
00:41:09 Because it was pretty close to where my bed was at the time.
00:41:13 Fortunately, the water was not, it was not like sewage or anything,
00:41:18 it did not smell bad or anything, it smelled like nothing.
00:41:22 So a day went by and it kept dripping,
00:41:24 and I'm like, oh god, fuck, I have to call my shitty fucking landlord,
00:41:27 my psycho landlord, who was a fucking slumlord scam artist piece of shit.
00:41:31 So I call her, she's like, okay, I'll call the property manager.
00:41:37 That guy couldn't come that night, but he came the next day, he showed up,
00:41:40 and he took a look, and he figured out it was like the radiator system
00:41:44 was like emitting steam, and the steam was condensing into this water,
00:41:48 and so he just had to like, he just had to like drain the pipe,
00:41:51 and he like tightened up some shit or whatever,
00:41:53 and now it works, it doesn't leak anymore.
00:41:55 So that's pretty cool.
00:41:57 I had to rearrange my room to keep my bed dry for that one night.
00:42:03 So, you know, it was pretty bad, pretty disgusting,
00:42:06 but not as bad as it could have been, a happy ending, I guess.
00:42:11 That's what happened.
00:42:13 Anyway, what was that, steam, leaky roofs, shitty apartments?
00:42:18 I don't remember what the point of that story was.
00:42:22 You said something about lifting and then gas.
00:42:26 Yeah, oh right, the poison gas, I got paranoid.
00:42:32 I get paranoid about carbon monoxide poisoning while I'm asleep,
00:42:36 so I bought a carbon monoxide detector.
00:42:40 I actually had a carbon monoxide detector, but it was kind of broken,
00:42:44 and I think like a battery that had been in it had leaked or something,
00:42:47 so I wasn't confident that it still worked, so I replaced it,
00:42:51 and now I'm good.
00:42:54 It is reading zero right now.
00:42:56 It has been reading zero the entire time since I installed it,
00:43:00 so your boy is safe from suffocation.
00:43:08 Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.
00:43:11 Hooray, hooray.
00:43:14 There's a boiler in my room.
00:43:18 It's behind a cabinet.
00:43:20 Yeah, there's a boiler in my kitchen.
00:43:23 I also am scared of carbon monoxide, and I've been a little short of breath,
00:43:31 not like all the time, but only during the night
00:43:35 when I have my door closed and the window closed,
00:43:38 and I think there's just not a lot of ventilation.
00:43:41 I feel like if it's not carbon monoxide, it doesn't seem to be.
00:43:45 It's carbon dioxide that I'm breathing out into a room that isn't getting any fresh oxygen.
00:43:50 I feel like if I don't open a window a little bit,
00:43:53 I'm gonna fucking die.
00:43:55 I'm gonna suffocate.
00:43:57 I have the same fear sometimes.
00:44:04 It's probably unfounded, at the probably won't happen,
00:44:07 but I get it.
00:44:10 It's like the slight lightheadedness that I can't exactly determine
00:44:15 whether it's sleepiness or lack of oxygen.
00:44:19 And lack of oxygen is the scariest thing,
00:44:22 because lack of oxygen, you just sort of slow down and stop.
00:44:29 And once you've stopped, would you ever be able to get out
00:44:33 if somebody doesn't open the door?
00:44:36 If I'm unconscious, I am completely vulnerable.
00:44:41 Yes, yes, true.
00:44:43 Even though it's winter, I have to keep a window open just a little bit,
00:44:47 which means it's really cold outside of the duvet.
00:44:51 Otherwise, it just doesn't feel right.
00:44:55 Makes, yeah.
00:44:57 I still have my air conditioner in the window,
00:45:02 even though it's definitely too cold for that now.
00:45:06 Also, kind of, yeah, for the same reason,
00:45:08 I don't want to be like I'm sealed in here.
00:45:12 It sort of gives a little bit of air flow,
00:45:14 but it's limited air flow, because it's not just like a hole.
00:45:18 I don't even know if it does allow air through, actually.
00:45:21 It might just be a mental thing.
00:45:24 I feel like it provides ventilation, whether it does or not.
00:45:29 I got new curtains.
00:45:32 I had no curtains, and I'm on the ground floor,
00:45:36 and I have two big windows, so I had no privacy.
00:45:40 I just tacked up a bed sheet over most of my windows,
00:45:46 and I put some pieces of cardboard, literal cardboard up.
00:45:51 I stood them up on top of the hung bed sheet,
00:45:56 just resting on top of it to cover up the rest of the windows.
00:46:00 I bought some actual curtains,
00:46:03 but the curtains that I bought, they got here,
00:46:06 and they were, because I didn't want blackout curtains,
00:46:09 because I want the natural light to wake me up,
00:46:11 to maintain a certain amount of regular sleeping schedule.
00:46:16 I got these thin curtains, but they were so thin
00:46:20 that they were completely see-through, completely transparent.
00:46:23 They didn't obscure anything.
00:46:25 So I bought another sheer curtain,
00:46:28 and I was like, if I just put two on top of each other,
00:46:30 that will obscure things.
00:46:33 No, it wasn't enough.
00:46:35 Even with both on top of each other still transparent.
00:46:37 So I'm like, okay, okay.
00:46:39 I will buy a thicker curtain, and I did.
00:46:44 So now I have all three of them stacked on top of each other,
00:46:47 and I think that maybe all three stacked on top of each other,
00:46:52 I think it's not quite enough to...
00:46:55 I think it's mostly enough to obscure me from the outside,
00:46:58 but also it blocks more of the light than I wanted to block,
00:47:02 because I want that natural light, and now I'm...
00:47:06 The bedsheet, the bedsheet let all the light in,
00:47:09 and completely obscured the view.
00:47:11 So the bedsheet was literally the perfect solution.
00:47:14 Why can't a curtain just be made of the same sheet as my bedsheet?
00:47:17 It did everything I wanted it to do.
00:47:21 Problems upon problems for me.
00:47:26 Wait, how...
00:47:28 In your apartment, I forget.
00:47:30 Are you in the one up stairs?
00:47:33 No, I'm on the first floor.
00:47:36 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:47:37 The low down where the people could just walk right by your window.
00:47:41 Yeah, okay, I can understand that.
00:47:43 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:47:45 See, if I was up on a second floor,
00:47:47 I usually wouldn't really worry too much about people looking up.
00:47:50 Oh, no, like, people can just...
00:47:53 I mean, cars pull into my driveway, right?
00:47:57 Like, it's at the level where if a person pulled into my driveway
00:48:01 and parked in front of my house,
00:48:03 their eye level would be exactly at the level of my windows.
00:48:06 They would be looking directly into my room.
00:48:08 So, yeah, I have to have something.
00:48:12 What a weird window.
00:48:14 Ah, but it's just a weird...
00:48:17 It's just a weird location relative to the outside.
00:48:24 Oh, well, it's fine.
00:48:27 Yeah, the room came with...
00:48:30 It had, like, metal bars.
00:48:31 It had these bars over the window.
00:48:34 Supposedly, it's some kind of, like, an anti-breaking measure.
00:48:39 But I was like, well, I need an air conditioner.
00:48:41 It's hot. It's still summer when I moved in.
00:48:44 So I had to get the guy to just take the bars off.
00:48:47 So, you know, now I'm vulnerable.
00:48:49 Now anyone can just climb in my window.
00:48:51 It doesn't even matter.
00:48:53 I'm sure those tiny, those tiny, thin little metal bars
00:48:56 would have stopped someone before.
00:48:59 Um, yeah.
00:49:01 They would go up to the window,
00:49:03 see the Bensaint lives there and say,
00:49:05 ah, man.
00:49:06 Ah, nothing, there's nothing here.
00:49:07 No reason.
00:49:08 Yeah, I hope so.
00:49:10 Unless they want Road to Radcon.
00:49:12 Then they'd smash it.
00:49:13 Yeah, they would steal my, like, 50 leftover copies of Road to Radcon.
00:49:16 Oh, I could sell those for $15 a copy.
00:49:19 Oh, damn, yeah.
00:49:21 Uh, please buy my extra copies of Road to Radcon.
00:49:25 Uh, please DM me on Discord or Twitter
00:49:28 or just PayPal me.
00:49:31 Arigato.
00:49:33 Okay.
00:49:34 Um, right.
00:49:35 So on the subject of selling stuff,
00:49:39 I, okay, I'm still not ready to publicly announce
00:49:42 what my little side project,
00:49:45 aside from Phantom's Revenge, is.
00:49:48 But, um, without getting into two specifics,
00:49:52 I will say that, uh, it's coming along.
00:49:56 It's, it's getting, it's getting ready to be public.
00:50:01 But I had a, one of the, I can't say what it is,
00:50:07 an item, an item that I needed to do it.
00:50:11 Uh, I got a new one, and then it broke immediately.
00:50:16 It broke, like, instantly.
00:50:18 And, uh, I am trying to negotiate for a refund on that.
00:50:24 Progress is held up for a moment
00:50:26 because I really don't want to buy a new one,
00:50:29 and I really don't think I should have to buy a new one.
00:50:32 And I really don't think anyone should have to pay for this,
00:50:35 except for the manufacturer who gave me a product
00:50:38 that just broke instantly.
00:50:39 But I, they are being, uh, annoying.
00:50:42 And I, I don't, just don't, I just,
00:50:45 just doesn't seem right.
00:50:46 Just, it just doesn't seem right.
00:50:47 It's just the principle of the thing.
00:50:49 Um, so I'm just trying.
00:50:51 Do they just not have a refund policy?
00:50:53 Uh, I don't exactly know.
00:50:56 It's, uh, the, it's not clear at the moment to me.
00:51:04 Uh, uh, uh, yeah, that's all you can really say about it.
00:51:09 Uh, but very, but very annoying.
00:51:13 Hold on.
00:51:14 I'm, I'm, I have to, quick, I have to extract some files.
00:51:19 I have to extract some.
00:51:21 This is part of the whole thing.
00:51:23 This is, these are the files.
00:51:25 This is, this is the work that my man Slobodan,
00:51:28 I got, I got a guy, I got a guy from Serbia named Slobodan
00:51:32 to work on this for me.
00:51:34 He's, he's done, he's done great work.
00:51:36 So let's see the clues are an item that breaks instantly sometimes.
00:51:43 A Serbian man.
00:51:45 Slobodan.
00:51:46 You know a guy.
00:51:47 Not just any Serbian guy.
00:51:48 Slobodan.
00:51:49 Slobodan.
00:51:50 Slobodan.
00:51:51 I told, I told Slobodan, I explained to Slobodan what I needed from him.
00:51:57 And he responded, he responded with a smiley face and said,
00:52:02 Okie dokie.
00:52:03 I love Slobodan.
00:52:07 Okie dokie.
00:52:09 So.
00:52:10 Okie dokie.
00:52:11 Slobodan and digital files.
00:52:15 I wonder what it could be.
00:52:17 There are, there are in fact digital file.
00:52:19 There are, there is digital, there is digital work afoot here.
00:52:24 We're living in the digital age.
00:52:27 Sad.
00:52:28 Sad but true.
00:52:29 That means it's not even interesting.
00:52:31 It means it's normal.
00:52:32 Then saying, how could you dare do something normal?
00:52:35 Unfortunately.
00:52:36 Yes, it is.
00:52:37 It's just normal.
00:52:38 It's just some normal shit.
00:52:40 Okay.
00:52:41 I don't want to talk about it anymore.
00:52:43 Well, less, less I be tempted to spill the beans.
00:52:46 I might, since, since it's going to be a thing that I'm going to have to sell because
00:52:52 I'm spending money to make it.
00:52:54 I might not announce it until January.
00:52:59 I might not announce it until after New Year's.
00:53:02 Strictly because, like, if I'm selling it for money, I want it to be in the New Year
00:53:11 because of, for tax reasons.
00:53:13 Because I think, because I think I'll be taxed more heavily on it if I sell shit this year
00:53:18 than if I sell, wait till next year.
00:53:20 And it's only like a month away, so I might, I might do that.
00:53:23 And it might not even be ready until then anyway.
00:53:25 I've got to do my tax return for January.
00:53:30 God damn.
00:53:31 I just, I just finished my taxes.
00:53:34 I just got my taxes, like, filed for 2020 because, like, I filed for all these extensions.
00:53:42 But they finally ran out and I had to do it.
00:53:45 I think I still owe my, I filed the returns.
00:53:48 I think I still owe the federal government, but I paid my state taxes.
00:53:53 It wasn't as, it wasn't as, I found some, I found some loopholes.
00:54:00 I found some, like, I found some, what's the word, some, some, like, tax breaks for, like, certain categories of things.
00:54:10 Like, I qualified for some, for some breaks that I didn't think I was going to cat, cat, kit, qualify for.
00:54:17 So it wasn't as bad as I expected.
00:54:20 Yes!
00:54:21 Yeah.
00:54:23 Based.
00:54:25 Yeah.
00:54:26 Oh yeah.
00:54:27 I've just realized, Lord of Ghosts income, I'm going to have to, like, to figure out how to do the taxes on that.
00:54:35 Because I haven't been able to buy all of that.
00:54:37 Like, a lot of the cost is postage.
00:54:40 But if I don't have all the things ready to send by the end of the year,
00:54:44 and I don't start posting them, I can't put that on my taxes as, like, money spent for business or whatever.
00:54:50 Oh yeah.
00:54:52 Oh no!
00:54:54 I mean, you could buy, you could, like, buy stamps ahead of time.
00:54:58 Yeah, yeah, I could, I could do all that.
00:55:00 It's just, I'm really stressing out.
00:55:04 I'm stressing out about a lot of things, but it's mostly just the Lord of Ghosts Kickstarter, everything around that.
00:55:09 And then the needing to do it before the end of the year, and now the taxes are like, oh yeah, that's also a thing.
00:55:18 I should try to get it done by the end of the year.
00:55:21 I'm still waiting on a few people to get the ghost stories finished.
00:55:26 Yeah.
00:55:27 But unfortunately, Kazi is sick right now, so they can't draw.
00:55:33 Why can't you draw when you're sick?
00:55:36 Well, they, I don't know.
00:55:38 They just said they'd try to get better first.
00:55:42 I thought they were, like, done.
00:55:45 I don't, they said, like, two of the pages are basically done, and then there's two others that they're working on at the same time.
00:55:55 And then just recently they got sick, so what would it, and there's-
00:56:01 They're sick for like two days.
00:56:04 Whatever.
00:56:05 Whatever.
00:56:06 I don't want to be, like, angry at anyone.
00:56:09 I do.
00:56:10 Because it's, it's, it's like...
00:56:16 Mm-hmm, gone, gone.
00:56:18 Well, it's not like I gave them a deadline.
00:56:22 I said I would like it to be done, but, you know, take your time, because I've got a lot of other things to do.
00:56:28 I've got the plushies to be made, and that's really the thing I thought was going to take the longest.
00:56:32 But now I have all the plushies, and I need to do a little, like, test prints on, like, the, how to figure out the green on the Redman comic,
00:56:43 but then I can print those, and then everything will be ready as long as I have the Lord of Ghosts themselves,
00:56:51 and then I've got to do the signing, and I've got to do the doodles,
00:56:55 and I've got to get a bunch of envelopes and packages and figure out the, do the Kickstarter, like, send out a request for addresses,
00:57:05 and then all the people have to be prompt with that, and it's like, oh my god, everything's going to go wrong.
00:57:12 I just feel it.
00:57:16 True.
00:57:17 And I don't like that.
00:57:19 That's upsetting.
00:57:22 Yeah, I was asking you about shipping, because this thing that I'm working on is something that I would have to ship,
00:57:31 and I was looking into, okay, so the Road to Radcon are books.
00:57:39 That's paper.
00:57:40 I can put those in an envelope and mail them as a letter, so that keeps the costs down significantly.
00:57:47 The pins.
00:57:48 I kind of cheated with mailing the pins.
00:57:50 I put them in an envelope, and I sent them as letters, and it probably shouldn't have counted,
00:57:55 but I got away with sending most of them as letters in the mail instead of as packages, so that also kept the costs.
00:58:03 I mean, it was higher because some of those were sort of heavy, but yeah, that kept the costs down.
00:58:08 This thing that I want to sell soon is, I don't think I'm going to be able to send it as a letter.
00:58:15 I think it's going to have to be sent as a package, which is not so bad for domestic shipping,
00:58:22 but internationally is pretty bad.
00:58:26 I was looking around, and I got really scared, because I was picking worst case scenario.
00:58:34 What's the worst country that I would have to send something to to find out what's the upper limit of how much this shipping is going to cost?
00:58:41 Australia.
00:58:42 Okay, Google, how much is it going to cost me to ship a small four ounce package to Australia?
00:58:48 $116.
00:58:50 And I'm like, are you fucking shitting me?
00:58:53 Are you fucking kidding me?
00:58:55 That doesn't make any sense.
00:58:57 I know it would be expensive, but like $100.
00:59:00 There was a reason.
00:59:02 The reason is that apparently, first class is what you call just normal send a package for cheap.
00:59:13 So normal first class shipping to Australia and New Zealand and maybe a couple other countries is just suspended right now because of COVID for some reason.
00:59:24 So yeah, it's just that they don't offer normal shipping to Australia at the moment.
00:59:29 So I would have to go with some other like priority mail that is like rush delivery costs $100, right?
00:59:35 So that's why.
00:59:37 And it turned out that shipping to other countries was not as bad as I thought.
00:59:41 It's kind of bad.
00:59:42 It's going to be like 15 bucks to ship to basically any other country.
00:59:47 A few countries might be a little more like Brazil was $19 for some reason, but like 15 up to maybe 20 seems to be.
00:59:57 So I would probably just charge like $15 shipping, which is less than I thought, but it's it sucks.
01:00:02 But like if that's I think that's the best I can do.
01:00:07 Yeah, so that's why that's why I was asking you about the shipping stuff.
01:00:11 Yeah, it turned out not to be it turned out not to be as bad as I thought.
01:00:16 A lot of ghosts is like hundred pages.
01:00:19 It's not going to be an envelope.
01:00:20 It's going to be at least a large envelope.
01:00:24 A large envelope or like if it's got a plush, it's going to be a box, small box.
01:00:31 And all of the ones that have the comic have the red man comics that makes it even thicker.
01:00:35 So, oh, everything's going to go wrong.
01:00:41 Yeah.
01:00:43 Man, after this never again.
01:00:45 Never will I ever do shipping of any kind.
01:00:49 You know, after I did the first I think after I did the first Vapors, I found myself being like this was so hard.
01:00:57 Like this Kickstarter was really difficult and it and it was not quick and easy.
01:01:03 And I like for months I was still fulfilling orders and I was like, this is so hard.
01:01:08 This totally wasn't worth it.
01:01:10 But like I've done more of that thing and I think I have.
01:01:15 I think I don't really mind it.
01:01:17 I think I don't mind the work of like, you know, addressing envelopes, going to the post office, putting them in the mail.
01:01:23 I think it's it's work and it takes a while, but I don't think I mind it that much.
01:01:27 And it like this kind of thing selling like selling physical products makes money more easily than like, I don't know.
01:01:37 Then then like, you know, donations online, right?
01:01:41 It's just kind of a.
01:01:43 I feel like it's a model that works pretty well.
01:01:45 And so I think I have decided that I don't mind it and I might continue to do this sort of thing into the future.
01:01:52 I'm just it's because it's the first time doing such a big thing.
01:01:56 And it's I'm I'm just stressed out.
01:01:59 I'm nervous.
01:02:00 Yeah.
01:02:01 I made sure I feel like I made sure to be like extra.
01:02:07 Like, like what do you call it, a margin of error, margin of too much money for shipping?
01:02:13 Yes, yes.
01:02:14 When I came up with all the original things.
01:02:16 But if the shipping in general is just more expensive now, I don't know that that's going to cover it.
01:02:24 Fuck.
01:02:27 Well, I got to do it, but I might cry.
01:02:31 I might cry about it.
01:02:32 The stakes, the stakes are.
01:02:34 Well, I'll do it either way.
01:02:36 It's just a question of whether I cry doing it or not.
01:02:39 It's a question of how much like tier like the volume of tears, how much you would displace in a cup.
01:02:48 And don't don't cry too much because tears are heavy.
01:02:53 And so they'll add weight to the packages and they'll make it cost more of a ship.
01:02:57 So I'll I'll ship them to myself.
01:02:59 I won't need I won't.
01:03:01 Tears are extra.
01:03:03 Yeah.
01:03:05 Speaking of stuff, I showed you the Edward Edward D. Al's progress on the Radcon for dojin.
01:03:16 Yes.
01:03:17 Which I'm sure I say this all the time.
01:03:19 I'm sure everyone believes that that's vaporware and will never materialize, but it will.
01:03:24 Edward is maybe not quite halfway done drawing it.
01:03:29 Thereabouts, something like that.
01:03:32 It looks really good.
01:03:33 I'm looking at a sample page right now.
01:03:36 It looks great.
01:03:38 Yes.
01:03:39 I'm going to be I wasn't going to do this, but I think I am going to I'm going to print I'm going to print some copies.
01:03:44 I'm going to I'm going to offer print copies to anyone that wants to buy them in the same way that I'm offering a road to Radcon to people.
01:03:53 Because maybe it could be a double a bonus.
01:03:56 I'm going to do it.
01:03:57 I'm going to do it like dojin get a free road to Radcon or slightly more like a discounted road to Radcon.
01:04:04 I gave anyone who was a PCP patron five dollars off of road to Radcon.
01:04:10 I think I will with with with the dojin.
01:04:14 I think I'll say like you get five dollars off the dojin if you either are a five dollar patron or you bought road to Radcon.
01:04:24 So that like if you were to buy both and you were a patron, you would get like a total of ten dollars.
01:04:29 You get five dollars off one and five dollars off the other.
01:04:33 Right.
01:04:35 I think it'll be the same because I don't want to do it that like, oh, if you're a patron, like if you're a patron and you bought road to Radcon, you got five dollars off the first the road to Radcon and now you get both stacked for ten dollars off.
01:04:53 The dojin so 50.
01:04:55 I don't want to give that much.
01:04:56 I want to give that much of a discount.
01:04:58 I want to give ten dollars across both books.
01:05:00 That seems fair to me.
01:05:02 Yeah.
01:05:04 Anyway, it's it looks good.
01:05:07 Edward, I want to say Edward's work looks really great and I can't wait for the final product, but he did annoy me a little bit by kind of disappearing for a while.
01:05:18 I was a bit worried that he was just gone and I would not be hearing from him again, but I was wrong.
01:05:25 He did eventually get back to me with the progress on the comic.
01:05:30 So it's all it's all good.
01:05:33 Yeah.
01:05:35 He seems to be working on it again.
01:05:38 Funny, funny shit.
01:05:40 Yeah.
01:05:42 It would have been pretty funny, though, if like he just he just disappeared.
01:05:45 He was like, well, I started it, but goodbye.
01:05:51 No, no, not what happens.
01:05:54 Lamal.
01:05:56 Well, we're coming up to the ending of twenty twenty one and the and the Radcon four stuff is still it's still coming out.
01:06:09 Not quite finished.
01:06:11 Told me Nate has been in Communicado lately.
01:06:16 I asked he told me as I told him Edward is getting the dojin done and he said that yes, he will work on getting the the OVA and the music video done.
01:06:29 And I have not heard anything about it from him about it since then.
01:06:33 So I don't know if he's been doing it.
01:06:36 I'm going to guess probably not.
01:06:38 But I hope he will do it because he said he would and we need him to.
01:06:45 Yeah.
01:06:47 I guess maybe I'll ask him again and say like, hey, so remember how I said the dojin is coming out?
01:06:55 Well, that's more true than ever.
01:06:57 So can we get those videos, please?
01:07:00 Just put a nice big bow on this whole Radcon four debacle.
01:07:04 Put it all behind us.
01:07:06 Have it all break break the curse.
01:07:09 Well, this is the only way to break the curse of Radcon four is to deliver on all the Kickstarter promises.
01:07:15 Just get that shit sorted.
01:07:17 Yes.
01:07:18 Yes, we're so close.
01:07:20 We're pretty we're pretty close.
01:07:22 We're pretty fucking close.
01:07:28 Should I release the should I post like a PDF version of Road to Radcon?
01:07:36 I suppose.
01:07:38 But then would people not want to get the physical version?
01:07:42 Well, they would.
01:07:44 I mean, I think everyone who is going to get a physical version has probably already gotten one.
01:07:49 Maybe a few people might see the PDF version and be like, oh, this is cool.
01:07:54 Maybe I do want to own a physical version.
01:07:57 I suppose it's not like that strange of an idea.
01:08:00 I think it could be worth it.
01:08:02 I think I had planned to maybe post a PDF version at the same time that I posted the dojin.
01:08:10 Whenever that happens, I don't know.
01:08:13 And I guess I was yeah, right.
01:08:15 I keep meaning to ask Tom because I want to post I was going to post it on the website and I don't know how to do that.
01:08:20 I have not asked.
01:08:25 Oh, well.
01:08:28 Um.
01:08:31 Yeah.
01:08:32 In other news, I guess I'd been still working hard on the second secret project.
01:08:37 Wait, one more.
01:08:39 Would people be mad?
01:08:40 Would people who bought the physical book be like mad if that I posted the PDF version?
01:08:47 Would they be like, if I knew there was going to be a public PDF version, I wouldn't have bought this piece of junk.
01:08:52 Throws it against the wall.
01:08:54 Does anyone care about that?
01:08:56 Is that a concern?
01:08:59 I don't know.
01:09:01 I mean, people who bought it probably bought it because it's like an item, not because they wanted to read it.
01:09:09 Commenters, let me know.
01:09:12 Of course, they don't actually want to read it.
01:09:14 Commenters, it's more interesting as like a thing that they could be like, I have this.
01:09:20 Commenters, if you bought Road to Radcon, let me know in the comments whether you'll be annoyed.
01:09:26 If I post the PDF version on the website for people to read digitally.
01:09:32 Also, please buy more copies.
01:09:34 I have a box of 50 copies.
01:09:36 I don't need 50 copies of Road to Radcon.
01:09:38 Please, please take my extra stock.
01:09:46 Yeah.
01:09:48 Okay.
01:09:49 I guess that's all I have to say about that.
01:09:51 Oh, you were going to talk about your...
01:09:53 Well, you started talking about your secret project.
01:09:55 Yeah, it's really not because I can't talk about what it is.
01:10:00 But it's getting to the point where I'm a little worried that it may go into December, still not be ready.
01:10:09 And then...
01:10:10 Oh, I'm sure that my stock is going into December.
01:10:15 December will be like, oh, suddenly you got to do things like family.
01:10:21 No, I don't want to do all that, but I should.
01:10:25 I mean, you can't just ignore social gatherings entirely because then they'll have happened and then you're like,
01:10:32 I don't know how to speak to anyone anymore.
01:10:36 Yeah, the holidays always feel like a big thing.
01:10:42 I'm always trying to work on something and then it's always like,
01:10:45 I have to take like two or three days away from that to go do some bullshit,
01:10:50 go see my fucking aunts and uncles.
01:10:52 I hate my aunts and uncles.
01:10:54 Yeah.
01:10:56 I mean, I don't hate mine, but they're not friends of mine.
01:11:00 Yeah, I don't hate them, but I don't want to stop doing my shit to go and catch up with them.
01:11:07 Oh, how are you doing?
01:11:08 Oh, who got married this year?
01:11:10 Oh, that guy?
01:11:11 Okay, cool.
01:11:12 Oh, who had a kid?
01:11:13 Oh, that guy?
01:11:14 Oh, cool.
01:11:15 Wow, that's great.
01:11:16 I love that.
01:11:17 All right.
01:11:18 Oh, I love the, I love the, I love the Guam keys you made.
01:11:21 These Guam keys are just to die for.
01:11:23 Yeah.
01:11:24 Incredible old family recipe.
01:11:25 Okay.
01:11:26 Bye.
01:11:27 You just get that clip and then play that on your phone.
01:11:32 Yeah.
01:11:33 Instead of speaking to them.
01:11:35 Yeah.
01:11:36 That's all.
01:11:38 Like, ultimately, I enjoy the break because Christmas time alone, even if you get a lot
01:11:46 of work done, it feels hollow afterwards.
01:11:48 You're like, dang, the holidays are over and I didn't speak to anyone sucks.
01:11:53 Kind of.
01:11:54 I like to, I like to indulge in things I don't actually like.
01:11:59 And like Stockholm syndrome.
01:12:01 Like, I'm stuck with this family.
01:12:04 Absolutely.
01:12:05 Like drinking a bit and talking about nothing in particular and just saying hi.
01:12:11 Yeah.
01:12:12 That's not so bad.
01:12:13 Nah, you're right.
01:12:14 It's never as annoying as I think it's going to be.
01:12:17 Yeah.
01:12:18 I mean, I always think it's going to suck shit.
01:12:21 And then it usually only sucks a little bit.
01:12:24 Yeah.
01:12:25 Especially when I was younger, I would always hate the idea of it.
01:12:28 And then I'm there and I'm like, you know, there's chocolate.
01:12:31 There's like peanuts.
01:12:32 There's a dog.
01:12:33 There's a dog.
01:12:34 You know, it's people saying hi and I don't have to do anything about it.
01:12:38 Yeah.
01:12:39 It's like, you know, this is fine.
01:12:41 Family is actually good.
01:12:43 If I'm at like a thing like that and I don't want to be there, it feels like an eternity.
01:12:49 It feels like I'm like, God, there's so many other things I could be doing.
01:12:53 There's so many things I could be doing with this time.
01:12:56 But then if I step back and think about it, I'm like, okay, that was maybe like six hours,
01:13:04 maybe 12 hours if I had to spend the whole day.
01:13:07 I waste 12 hours all the time, right?
01:13:10 12 hours comes and goes without even noticing all the time.
01:13:14 It's stupid to get bent out of shape about one day, right?
01:13:18 I waste most days of my life, frankly.
01:13:22 It's like I've never been to a social gathering with friends or family that has lasted longer than the longest streams I've done.
01:13:32 Yeah.
01:13:33 Yeah.
01:13:34 True.
01:13:35 That's right.
01:13:36 Yeah, I'll stream for like seven hours sometimes.
01:13:40 Yeah, you're right.
01:13:42 I think it's just sort of like a holdover.
01:13:44 When you go to those things in your young time, obviously feels like it takes longer.
01:13:48 Yeah.
01:13:49 At a place for two hours is like agonizing.
01:13:52 But two hours, even if you're bored, it's not that bad as an adult.
01:13:57 And also, we've got phones now, so we have an excuse to just distract ourselves with some bullshit.
01:14:02 Yeah, two hours is nothing.
01:14:05 Yeah, you're right.
01:14:07 And maybe it is.
01:14:08 It's just, I remember being bored as a kid and feeling like it was interminable.
01:14:13 But now, yeah, just goes by in a flash.
01:14:18 No problem.
01:14:19 Merry Christmas.
01:14:21 Merry Christmas.
01:14:23 Yes.
01:14:24 Yes.
01:14:25 Excellent.
01:14:26 Oh, did my files extract?
01:14:28 Oh, did my files?
01:14:30 I think they did.
01:14:32 I think my files extracted.
01:14:34 Let me check.
01:14:35 Yeah, essential oils.
01:14:37 Let me check on my, oh, did it?
01:14:40 There it is.
01:14:43 Ooh, that's a good file.
01:14:45 It's the right size, too.
01:14:47 Hmm, that's a great file right there.
01:14:49 Takes a extraction like no problem.
01:14:52 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:14:54 Let me compare it to my other file.
01:15:00 Six, seven, six, eight.
01:15:03 Okay.
01:15:04 Ooh, very nice.
01:15:06 Very nice.
01:15:07 A sound of an accountant.
01:15:09 Well, that's me.
01:15:13 I'm I'm all about I'm all about adding up the numbers
01:15:17 True
01:15:19 Sure, I'm you know, that's that's the churning lifestyles. You got it. You got a key you got to get a count all your pennies
01:15:25 Stack them up
01:15:27 I'm stacking pennies some some people some people
01:15:31 Stack Benny's I'm over here stacking pennies
01:15:36 But all the same tease Ben Ben. Yes. Yes, exactly
01:15:41 And Benny's but it all gets us to the same place eventually just mine gets me there slower and I never get as far
01:15:51 I think my audio is really quiet for some reason my microphone is quiet
01:15:55 Eleazar you're probably gonna have to like increase my volume a bit. I don't know why I'm just quiet today. Sorry about that
01:16:03 Do do something about it?
01:16:06 I don't know man
01:16:09 Dog
01:16:11 What's up? Yeah, what were we talking about?
01:16:14 Well, I mean, I basically said everything. That's I've been working on the the secret project
01:16:21 Stressing out about the Lord of Ghosts. I've been playing fucking
01:16:25 Tower defense bloons. Oh god
01:16:29 And that's been fun. I've been putting monkeys down and they've been throwing darts
01:16:33 Putting monkeys down putting them down like dogs taking them out behind the shed
01:16:39 Ah
01:16:41 Duh-duh
01:16:42 Went on that one adventure
01:16:45 We talked about Michael Owen
01:16:47 Yeah, and yeah, that was like on the adventure. Remember all the all the memories remember all those times
01:16:54 remember remember those times where we
01:16:58 Came up with like the Michael wave as a dip as an alternative to the microwave
01:17:04 Michael Michael Owen. Yeah, the Michael wave
01:17:06 He waves his hand around food and it cooks it just like a microwave
01:17:10 But it's Michael Owen doing it and that was that was one of the many jokes
01:17:14 So we came up with as we were walking across Canterbury and the fields and the woodlands beyond and that was like
01:17:20 Yeah, what a story really not really good for a not a good for a podcast that one. It's kind of stupid
01:17:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah for real
01:17:30 That's true
01:17:34 Hey, there's this one farm that like had
01:17:38 We were looking on the the Google Maps and stuff and that was like a public footpath
01:17:43 That goes straight through this farm out into the woods and this farm did everything in its power
01:17:49 to imply that it is private land and you can't go there
01:17:55 and
01:17:56 it's all like
01:17:58 You like they didn't have
01:18:01 legal authority to kick you off because
01:18:05 The road like the driveway road through their main gate
01:18:10 It had to stay open
01:18:12 but they had loads of signs in
01:18:14 Red with bold white letters saying private property
01:18:17 So but it was a public road, right? You say it was a public road that just happened to go through a public footpath like
01:18:26 Like there's like sectioned off little places with
01:18:29 With signs wooden signs with arrows saying, you know, yellow triangle saying this way is the
01:18:36 Is the continuation of the of the public part that goes through forests
01:18:40 there's things like that all over Britain and
01:18:42 They sometimes go through farms, but farmers don't like it, but they can't really do anything about it
01:18:47 So they have to imply if they don't want people walking near their their buildings
01:18:51 They have to imply that it's so fucked up that you're here and we're gonna shout at you and shoot you if you
01:18:57 This is anything this this is not a place of honor
01:19:00 Nothing. Nothing is no great deed is esteemed here. You know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah, I do not oh
01:19:08 There's a reference something the the
01:19:11 The the like thing about like like how would you how would you?
01:19:17 Denote a like like a toxic like radioactive place in a way that like would still be
01:19:23 Comprehensible like thousands of years later. I
01:19:26 Don't know. There's like
01:19:29 Hold on if I Google this is not a place of honor
01:19:36 Okay, yeah, the Wikipedia long-time nuclear waste warning messages
01:19:41 Hold on here. Yeah, here are some like think things that like this is just sort of like a theoretical
01:19:48 Idea of like how would we communicate?
01:19:50 Don't go here to like future generations
01:19:53 It's like what would we want to evoke and some of the the phrases are like this place is not a place of honor
01:19:59 No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here. Nothing valued is here. What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us
01:20:07 This message is a warning about danger
01:20:10 The danger is to the body and it can kill the form of the danger is an emanation of energy
01:20:17 and
01:20:19 Like yeah, the idea was like maybe they were like maybe we could maybe we cover the entire like
01:20:25 Surrounding like square kilometer with like, you know giant spikes
01:20:30 We just like cover it and like Giants like wooden spikes to just be like this place will kill you don't come here. It's deadly
01:20:36 I don't know so that they do that is what I'm saying
01:20:41 The sign with all that language on it seems like oh thousands of years later
01:20:46 Surely the language would be
01:20:48 Changed. I I think I think the idea is that it would not literally say that in English. These are like
01:20:56 ideas that they want
01:20:58 To yeah, they want you not here's it yeah a 1993 report from the Sandia National laboratories
01:21:04 Aimed to communicate a series of messages non-linguistically to any future visitors to a waste site
01:21:09 It gave the following wording as an example of what those messages should evoke
01:21:14 right hmm
01:21:17 The end you're is unleashed only within danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically
01:21:24 This place is best shun and left uninhabited
01:21:27 Oh
01:21:28 We would know this is good this place is a message and part of a system of messages pay attention to it
01:21:35 Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture
01:21:40 This place is not a place of honor, etc. Etc
01:21:45 I feel like no matter what very right
01:21:49 People will still curiously go there and die
01:21:52 Yeah
01:21:54 Probably because I guess the sign would then they would be like oh sign
01:22:00 Says something somebody died in maybe it's dangerous in yeah, I mean
01:22:05 There's always the chance that like no matter how strongly you try to convey like
01:22:10 This place is dangerous. Someone might get the idea like oh they want they want to keep me out
01:22:16 You know, they must be guarding something good
01:22:19 Right like they must want to do something valuable
01:22:23 They must they must hmm. This must be a place of lots of honor
01:22:27 There must be some extremely highly esteemed deeds commemorated here. There must be some very valuable things here
01:22:37 Otherwise why would they tell me that there aren't you know, what what are they hiding right?
01:22:43 They're scooby-doing it
01:22:45 They go the spooky scary guys saying
01:22:48 Get out of here so that I can steal the money
01:22:52 Yeah, you're scared away
01:22:55 You're right
01:22:56 Yeah, that is that is one way to interpret
01:22:59 Scooby-Doo as a verb is to do something scary to make people leave you alone
01:23:06 So you can get that you can reap the rewards so you can collect the insurance money or something
01:23:11 There's insurance money, there's
01:23:14 Buried gems or like a deed to a house is gonna expire and ownership is always some sort of thing like as long as people are scared
01:23:21 And they're gone then I'll have all this money. I gotta scare people truly we live truly capitalism sure is fucked up that it
01:23:29 Incentivizes like putting on a goblin costume and running around and scaring people
01:23:35 These are systems broken man
01:23:37 Fuck I was going to say so. Oh, yeah, isn't there maybe it's not in England. Maybe it's in like Wales or something
01:23:47 but isn't there some
01:23:49 policy of like
01:23:51 You're like anyone is allowed to walk anywhere
01:23:54 Or like like farm like anyone is allowed to walk on a farm even if it's private property like as long as they don't like
01:24:01 Take anything. I feel like there's some countries that have laws that are specific. America's not one of them
01:24:07 Yes, America's very get off my land
01:24:11 I
01:24:12 Think you that might be Scotland. There's a row of right to Rome. Yes
01:24:19 Yes, I think Norway also. I'm not sure if England does. I'm not sure if Wales does either
01:24:25 Okay, this is I feel like what wasn't that guy who like walked in a straight line across
01:24:30 The con the island. Yes across Wales or Scotland or England. It was across Wales
01:24:37 Yeah, maybe okay. Maybe that's why I was thinking Wales because I remembered that guy
01:24:41 Just walked but he probably had to trespass at some point. He did do another one where he attempted to cross Scotland in a straight line
01:24:51 Hell yeah, yeah
01:24:53 um
01:24:54 Okay, I just uh, I thought maybe
01:24:57 That was why the farmers can only imply
01:25:01 Yeah, well, I don't know. Um in England. It's it's a different thing. It's not you don't have the right to go on people's land
01:25:09 Yeah, um necessarily but there are
01:25:13 Built into the countryside
01:25:16 um
01:25:18 Like hard and fast like this needs to be accessible by foot
01:25:22 You need to be able to walk through these fields
01:25:25 To get to a river or whatever. There's just like a network of public footpaths
01:25:32 You have to be able you have to let people walk here
01:25:36 Um, the public owns these little walkways and things and they're signposted by councils or whatever
01:25:44 And farmers sometimes it they go straight straight through their land and nice farmers will make it very clear
01:25:50 They'll upkeep the sign saying this is the way you go and people generally walk on the edge of a field
01:25:56 Right to get to like a gate or a style to go into the next one and then it goes, you know this way and that way
01:26:02 It's like a curated little
01:26:04 series of paths
01:26:06 And I like it I
01:26:08 It was one of those things where I didn't I never really thought about it until I realized that not every country does that
01:26:15 Yeah, I mean
01:26:18 Got it just like gotta gotta have usually if there's a field if there's a farm and there's a field
01:26:23 Usually you're allowed to go through
01:26:25 some of it
01:26:27 I would hope so
01:26:28 It would be a bit shitty to let someone's private property impede, you know the public's ability to move about freely
01:26:35 In my opinion
01:26:37 Uh
01:26:42 Um, uh, you want to talk about you want to go to voicemails? Um, I'm out of stuff
01:26:48 Uh
01:26:50 What else happened?
01:26:53 Oh, there's kyle written house, but I don't really know anything about that still
01:26:56 Oh, well, I was I was
01:26:58 It was funny
01:26:59 I was listening back to last week's episode and I heard myself talking about kyle written house and how everyone
01:27:04 I follow on twitter said he was gonna get a full acquittal
01:27:07 And uh, I was right or they were right. Um, yeah
01:27:11 Even he even got off on charges that seem unambiguously true like illegal possession
01:27:16 Like he just he just did illegally possess the firearm like it's not even a question
01:27:21 But he just got off on the charge anyway
01:27:25 Yeah, that seems weird. I feel like
01:27:28 Like, uh, obviously they were pushing for guilty or nothing for to get him off
01:27:33 But like sure I feel like if you are in possession of a gun or you're you're an owner of a gun
01:27:40 You're in charge of this gun and this gun while in your possession
01:27:45 You know
01:27:46 You're kind of responsible for what it does you're responsible for what happens to some extent if it's a misfire
01:27:52 Or it's an accident, but two people end up dead
01:27:56 Or whatever. Yeah, I feel like at the very least there should be should be like
01:28:01 A fine and like a removal of gun rights for a certain period of time
01:28:06 Well, there's a very bare minimum something like that. Well the fact that nothing happens is a bit well the the um
01:28:14 There will be the okay. I I am genuinely
01:28:18 shocked and befuddled that like
01:28:21 None of the charges stuck that I was pretty sure he would get off on the murder charges
01:28:25 But I thought there was no way he was dodging, you know
01:28:29 Illegal possession illegal open carry that kind of stuff, but he did somehow which is very weird
01:28:35 um
01:28:37 But uh, you know, none of the criminal charges stuck
01:28:39 But like there's still civil suits to be filed like the family like the families of like the victims and uh other people are gonna
01:28:47 Be like they're gonna be in court for like damages and stuff, right? So like it's not
01:28:54 Not it's not nothing is gonna happen. Nothing criminal is gonna happen. He's gonna have to deal with this for a long time, which is good
01:29:02 But of course right-wing psychopaths will like pay all his bills for him and raise money for him to cover anything he gets sued for so
01:29:09 uh, whatever
01:29:11 Yeah, um
01:29:13 Anyway, right so everything everything I was saying would probably happen with kyle did last week. So
01:29:20 Uh funny funny shit
01:29:24 Love it
01:29:27 That's depressing that's pretty depressing. I guess that's just the the news there's not really much else I can think of
01:29:34 funny funny funny funny thing, um
01:29:39 Friend friend of the show spiral the guy who was compiling the n-word counter
01:29:45 For the pcp he's going through every episode and keep in count for all everyone
01:29:50 Uh, he he asked me to help him with a school assignment. It was very funny
01:29:54 He I guess he had to like interview people about times things went wrong. This is how he described
01:30:00 This is how he described the assignment to me
01:30:02 So he asked me if he would he could ask me some questions and I was like sure
01:30:05 So he did a voice call and he asked me about he asked me about like uh the falling out with trixie
01:30:11 That was what he what he wanted to me to talk about
01:30:15 So I I he asked me a bunch of stuff about that and I just gave him some sound bites about it. Uh
01:30:21 I guess I just thought that was funny
01:30:25 Um, it's something I'm always down to talk about um as I continue to see and cope with rage
01:30:33 Uh at all times
01:30:35 Yes, about that. Yes
01:30:37 Speaking of of of that then did you know that the streak?
01:30:42 The streak was broken last episode
01:30:45 A few people pointed it out. Yeah, I read a voicemail
01:30:48 The title that had the n word in it the soft with the soft a though, but uh, yes, I know it's it's still
01:30:56 It's still the n word. I I I do have that in in my head. I'm like, yeah, it's okay if it's the a but like
01:31:03 Why is there a discrepancy? Why is there a difference in the first place? It's really just to get away with it
01:31:08 There's no reason that's used. I said it
01:31:12 I said it. I realized after I was like, oh jeez. I said it lull. Uh, I mean I was reading the voicemail
01:31:19 Uh, I don't know. I've said it before
01:31:22 Uh, I don't know. I'll just say it again. I'll just I don't know it it's it's not it's not I mean it's a dark day
01:31:30 It's a dark day
01:31:32 It's sad. Let's let's let's face facts. It's not the first time it's happened on this show
01:31:37 Uh, oh well
01:31:39 What's what can you do? What can you do?

01:32:08 Okay, that's it
01:32:11 clipped
01:32:12 voicemail
01:32:14 Yes, okay. Do you got we're sorry. We're sorry about the n-word. We please please restart the the streak and and count from now
01:32:24 To zero yes
01:32:26 Zero it has been zero it has been zero episodes since the n-word was added
01:32:32 Um, okay, let's let's get uh, let's let's get these goddamn messages
01:32:38 Uh, looks like the first one this week is called digimon ghost game. You ready?
01:32:47 Uh
01:32:50 Yes, yes, okay
01:32:52 Get digimon ghost game three two one go
01:32:56 In the slim chance at tom is on this one. What are your thoughts on digimon ghost game?
01:33:03 If he's not on then uh, what are your thoughts on digimon ghost game?
01:33:09 Never seen it
01:33:13 Give
01:33:14 Digimon ghost game
01:33:17 I know I hardly knew is that a new one. I've never heard of it
01:33:21 digimon go
01:33:23 Digimon ghost game
01:33:26 Ninth anime series in the digimon franchise
01:33:30 Uh, oh, oh, yeah, it's it's running right now. It's current. So I have no idea. I have no idea
01:33:37 Is it like squid game but different?
01:33:40 Yes
01:33:41 Did you watch squid squid game?
01:33:44 No, I've seen the some of the character designs and I was like, yeah, it looks pretty good
01:33:49 Yeah, oh, I saw the why I saw yms's review of it
01:33:52 He thought it was pretty good. I turned that off because I didn't want to be spoiled because I
01:33:56 I didn't one of those
01:33:58 I didn't care about one of those things that probably would like to know about
01:34:02 Yeah, I was like, yeah, fuck it
01:34:05 Okay, next one is called a question three two one go
01:34:11 Hey Ben you talked about a book with a guy trying to write the perfect sentence
01:34:15 If you remember the name of the book, I can be free of one of my brain worms also. Fuck Trixie
01:34:21 yes
01:34:23 uh easy actually
01:34:26 I mentioned the book
01:34:28 I would be should I could be a real shitter and say that the book in question is one that I mentioned on the last episode
01:34:38 Uh
01:34:39 But I won't do that. I won't make you go back and listen to it. Yeah, the book is the plague by camu
01:34:46 It's not like a main plot point. It's just what it's just kind of a side
01:34:50 Uh bit in in this sort of sort of a side story in that book
01:34:54 The guy who wants to write the perfect sentence and what is he the one he comes up with like
01:35:00 one
01:35:01 One it's like one one fine. I mean this doesn't translate perfectly because the original book was in french. I think
01:35:08 Like one fine day in may
01:35:12 A lovely young woman
01:35:15 Writing a black sorrel mare strolled down the boo de boo yon
01:35:20 Something like that. And I don't know if I'm pronouncing that name correctly
01:35:24 Um, it's the plague by camu
01:35:26 Um, next one is called Alaskan weeb to gibb re kino's journey
01:35:32 three two one go
01:35:35 All right gib so for kino's journey, whether you want to finish it or not
01:35:38 If you're looking for some sort of big payoff at at the end where it all comes together and goes full circle
01:35:44 You're not going to get that neither the original version of kino's journey nor the
01:35:49 2018 I want to say version of kino's journey
01:35:52 Has some big payoff at the end. What are you what you're getting in the first three four episodes?
01:35:57 That's what it keeps what it keeps being. It's good. I recommend it
01:36:00 It's one of my favorites, but you're not going to get a massive payoff at the end
01:36:05 So bear that in mind if you're just say deciding on whether to finish it or not
01:36:10 wait
01:36:11 They remade kino's journey in 2018
01:36:14 I had no idea
01:36:16 When I gul that I only found the like 2003 or whatever it whenever it was version
01:36:21 I think it wikipedia says it was it started in 2000
01:36:26 Yeah, um
01:36:28 the first episode of kino's journey is like
01:36:31 It's a backdrop of some sort of melancholic
01:36:37 like
01:36:39 Not really dystopia, but kind of dystopia-esque future
01:36:43 And and this kid
01:36:46 and a bike
01:36:48 are driving around and they're having deep conversations about philosophy and humanity and
01:36:56 I
01:36:58 Yeah, if that's the entire show, I don't know whether I'd want to watch all of it because
01:37:03 I feel like it's the sort of thing that I would have found deep if I was younger listening to them talk about it
01:37:09 I'm like, yeah, I've thought about this stuff before that. This is like teenager. Shit. It's not exactly like low brown
01:37:16 um, but it's
01:37:19 It's
01:37:20 Not would you say it's not that interesting. Would you say it's I'm 14 and this is deep?
01:37:25 I would say it's approaching that that's a bit of a that's a bit of a derogative way to put it
01:37:30 Yeah, it's it's not that like dumb
01:37:34 smart if you know what I mean is it's just sort of like
01:37:38 Are they going to is this going to actually
01:37:41 Interest me as an adult or is it the sort of thing?
01:37:45 That is good when you're younger and you haven't thought about what if
01:37:49 What about the the reason religion exists?
01:37:52 Like I've thought of that
01:37:55 That's old news. Yeah
01:37:58 Yes, I
01:38:00 I watched I think I mentioned that I watched a few episodes of it
01:38:05 I must have seen the old version because yeah, there is a new version called kino's journey the beautiful world
01:38:11 Uh, I didn't know they remade it. I guess they did
01:38:14 Yeah, I watched some of the old one, but I never like finished it and I guess that's fine because I guess it doesn't really have like
01:38:21 An ending so okay
01:38:24 I'm gonna watch a few more episodes. Do you ever watch do you ever watch high bonnet renme?
01:38:31 No, I've heard that name. What is it? It's another
01:38:34 It reminds me of kino's journey and it's like in its tone
01:38:39 It's another one that I kind of think doesn't really
01:38:42 Have much of I mean it has a story and it has some lore
01:38:45 It's about these like girls in like a village, but like the girl they grow
01:38:52 Like wings they grow like wings and halos
01:38:56 And it's just like
01:38:57 I don't even remember
01:38:59 They're just kind of like living they're just kind of like living in this little commune village
01:39:04 and just hanging out
01:39:06 And they just go through this weird like oh sometimes we grow wings and halos
01:39:11 But it's fine and we're just uh
01:39:15 I think it might be some kind of like oh some of us are actually like dead and we got to like deal with like
01:39:23 The trauma of like our life. I genuinely don't remember whether the twist is like they were dead all along or not
01:39:29 I genuinely don't remember if that twist ever comes
01:39:33 Uh, I remember thinking it was probably coming
01:39:37 um
01:39:38 But it's like you know, and then it's just kind of a sort of meandering sort of
01:39:43 calm
01:39:45 Sort of like let's just kind of talk about life man sort of anime
01:39:49 Yeah, yeah with a with a muted color palette
01:39:53 That's a weed smoking show
01:39:56 That's a calm weed smoking show. Maybe yeah, maybe a weed smoking show
01:40:00 Uh
01:40:01 High bonnet ran me is a bit somber for weed smoking
01:40:05 Well, I don't know I haven't seen it but like you know, it's journey. I feel like is yeah
01:40:10 Perhaps perhaps smoking weed and driving no motorbike
01:40:18 What more could you ask for?
01:40:21 um
01:40:22 Next next voicemail is not a voicemail. It's just a question. Do you enjoy making pcp content?
01:40:29 um
01:40:31 I mean the only the only real
01:40:33 Content we make now would be the podcast and yeah, I enjoy recording the podcast
01:40:38 I enjoy it being a thing
01:40:40 It's like ben sain and I like talking up to ben sain and it's like that's easy
01:40:46 I like talking to you too give
01:40:49 If I if I didn't I probably wouldn't still be doing it
01:40:53 um
01:40:55 If you mean okay in terms of I guess the radcon stuff is
01:40:59 Still is pcp content which I have been you know having get made for a while I
01:41:05 I
01:41:08 I feel a certain sense of
01:41:12 I feel a sort of uh
01:41:15 Yeah, I think I do even though you might think oh my god
01:41:17 It's been like a year and a half almost two years since this fucking radcon thing happened and I'm still working on it
01:41:23 It doesn't bother me
01:41:25 I just feel a sense of like anticipation of like boy. I can't wait
01:41:30 I can't wait until it's done and everything's done and I can look back and I say
01:41:34 Yeah, it took me two years, but I did it. We did it
01:41:37 Uh, uh, uh, uh, fuck fuck everyone that said we weren't gonna do it. I did everything
01:41:44 Um, every everything that I had everything that had to be finished was and I know that that day is coming
01:41:51 and uh, it makes me
01:41:53 Happy so it's not yeah, I guess I do enjoy it in that I enjoy in sort of the sense of a job well done
01:42:00 Not in terms of like, oh, this is fun. I'm having fun right now
01:42:03 Um, because I mean most of that stuff is yeah
01:42:07 Like um, the fact that it isn't done. I am not enjoying. Um, but like yeah same as
01:42:14 Getting it done is not like something I dislike
01:42:18 It's just a lot of work. Hey having it not
01:42:21 Done is a is a source of unenjoyment
01:42:25 And I would consider I would consider the removal of unenjoyment to be a form of enjoyment
01:42:30 Which I will derive from
01:42:33 the completion of
01:42:35 Radcon
01:42:37 Yes, and even just in general like pcp content
01:42:41 is
01:42:42 largely
01:42:43 fun
01:42:45 And not really work because if it was
01:42:48 Then we would have tried harder to like push the algorithm and do things more
01:42:53 And all of us knew like at any point
01:42:57 We're just like just making things that we kind of were interested in
01:43:02 Damn the algorithm damn large success
01:43:06 Yeah, there came a point there came a point where I think we all kind of were just like
01:43:12 There's not like
01:43:14 The pcp is not meant to
01:43:17 Be like an algorithm appealing
01:43:19 Yeah thing. This is not designed to you know catch catch fire and go viral, right?
01:43:26 Uh, yeah
01:43:28 Uh next
01:43:31 Let's do it. I'll do it out of love. We do it out of love
01:43:34 I do it for you the viewer because I love you
01:43:37 Yes
01:43:40 The next voicemail is janes three two one go
01:43:45 Ben saying you mentioned the golden girls a couple of times throughout the pcp
01:43:50 And it reminded me of this youtube video called golden girls buys a dangin rompa class trial
01:43:58 I think it's the most that any zoomers on the internet would have watched of the show
01:44:04 But I am curious how you came across the golden girls
01:44:07 Because I don't imagine you as the type of person to ever watch a sitcom
01:44:13 golden girls
01:44:15 buys a
01:44:16 Golden girls buys a high bump not high bonnet rend me a dangin rompa trial. That sounds really funny
01:44:22 um
01:44:23 I
01:44:25 That's funny that you think i'm not a sitcom. I mean I did watch sitcoms as a
01:44:29 Kid. I mean the simpsons is is a sitcom. I watched so much of that. You know, I watched seinfeld
01:44:36 uh, I watched uh
01:44:39 You watched a fresh principale
01:44:42 A little bit a little bit
01:44:45 That was my main one aside from simpsons. I guess
01:44:48 Uh, I mean I I mean when I was a kid kid. I watched, you know, I would watch like full house and and uh
01:44:57 Step by step
01:44:58 Wait, is that a is that a show step by step, right?
01:45:04 I don't know family, you know family matters. I was an I was an urkel fan. I guess for a while
01:45:10 Um, I remember one called my wife and kids
01:45:14 I've never heard of that one
01:45:16 It's yeah, it was more modern
01:45:19 Then but like 10 years ago. Uh, yeah
01:45:24 The hell when when was that step by step is a sitcom um, but I
01:45:30 But I did not watch golden girls as a kid. No, uh, the the the answer to that question is that my my uh,
01:45:37 My ex-girlfriend was a big fan and she got me to uh
01:45:42 She got me to watch the the entire series with her
01:45:45 Uh, and uh, you know what? I don't even regret it because I mostly enjoyed it. I thought it was a pretty pretty good series
01:45:52 Uh, had some had some memorable moments that I continue to
01:45:57 Bring up in conversation
01:45:59 Uh to this day mostly the the one about uh, uh dorothy
01:46:04 Having the like the chronic fatigue disorder and not being able to find a doctor that would like, uh
01:46:10 That would diagnose her
01:46:12 That one really stuck with me
01:46:15 Uh
01:46:18 I don't know that's a pretty good show
01:46:20 I don't know if I would recommend watching the whole fucking series. I don't know if it's worth that
01:46:24 That's pretty enjoyable for what it is
01:46:26 Uh, rose and rose is rose's best girl, of course
01:46:31 Blanche's worst girl obviously
01:46:34 Do they wear my my my ex like blanche so so, you know, that's why I got a pick first girl. Fuck. Fuck blanche
01:46:42 Yeah, well
01:46:45 Blanche blanche is the worst though blanche is very obnoxious
01:46:51 But I mean obviously like that's on purpose right she's supposed to be kind of a snooty
01:46:56 snooty southern bell rich girl
01:47:00 Oh, now I want to watch it. Oh really?
01:47:04 I love snooty rich girls in media. That's my favorite. Uh, I don't know if you would like
01:47:11 You know what golden girls is about right?
01:47:14 Uh old women. Yes. Okay. As long as you as long as you realize that these are old women we're talking about
01:47:21 Well, uh, you know
01:47:24 I
01:47:28 Risk is gonna get old one day. She's gonna be in a home
01:47:34 I mean, yeah, I honestly give it a shot. Give it a shot. You might like golden girls. I did
01:47:40 Yeah, I I it's hard to imagine that it would be good because I I always thought of it as like
01:47:47 Because they're old
01:47:48 characters
01:47:49 The show must be very old and therefore bad
01:47:52 It's like it's before it's before jokes and were invented
01:47:57 But no, believe it or not believe it or not the show like the just the older the characters are the older the show is
01:48:05 Just like that's that's my head just goes to 100 years ago everybody who acted in on tv was like ancient
01:48:12 It was like a hundred years old
01:48:14 It was like a prestigious position. You had to work your way up before you could act
01:48:20 Uh
01:48:21 Minimum of 80
01:48:24 You would you would you would probably like rose but for me rose is best girl and I I feel I feel like that's pretty
01:48:32 Commenters, let me know in the comments if rose is best girl or if you who's who's best girl, right?
01:48:38 Rose is like the funny one rose is like the pinky pie
01:48:42 Uh, what about fucking garenet? What about no the worst golden girl?
01:48:50 um
01:48:51 Wait gold's not even a gold's not even a jewel gold's not even a jam
01:48:56 New new show but the girls are made of minerals golden girl. It's she's
01:49:03 She's made of molten metal
01:49:07 There's there's fools golden girl
01:49:10 That's blanche for sure
01:49:13 Uh
01:49:16 Yes, so that's the story of why I watched golden girls
01:49:19 Uh, next one is called a keyblade spirit. She hurt three two one go
01:49:27 Holy fucking shit
01:49:30 Oh my fucking god get to the point. I'm a fucking girl
01:49:37 anyway
01:49:38 I'm establishing the consortium of gibhuggers to combat the nate fuckers
01:49:45 I uh
01:49:46 I hope you don't join
01:49:48 Bye
01:49:51 Did we
01:49:52 I feel like we didn't comment. Yeah, it was this week that nate released a video
01:49:57 Tempting many off the path of righteousness and causing them to fail no nate november. Oh, that's true
01:50:03 Yeah, I I hadn't gotten around to it and then people mentioned that and I was like, oh, that's true
01:50:08 I've got a whole true to my roots to my
01:50:11 To my cause the delta rune video. I would I would describe the delta rune video as the 9 11 of no nate november
01:50:20 Uh, it was just catastrophic
01:50:24 I did not watch the video because I do not want delta rune spoilers because i'm still going to play uh
01:50:30 Part two at some point
01:50:32 I haven't gotten around to it, but it definitely will happen first phantom's revenge or delta rune
01:50:37 Genuinely, I might finish phantom's revenge first because like I why would I play another video game when I should be making one?
01:50:44 I actually that's might actually be what happens
01:50:48 um
01:50:50 I guess I approve of the gib the consortium of gibhuggers gibhuggers. It's pretty good
01:50:56 It's pretty good
01:50:57 Which is better is is a consortium better than a league?
01:51:02 uh, well
01:51:04 I wonder what the the etymology of those are consortium
01:51:07 Is like everyone's consorting together. Yeah, I feel like a consortium is just a bunch of people that's like a military thing or like a
01:51:15 A measurement of distance
01:51:17 Lee league really used as a military thing league really feels like it's a group of people that have gotten together to do something
01:51:24 Consortium feels like it's a bunch of people that have gotten together to talk about something
01:51:27 So maybe the hugging of gibb is gonna make remain mostly theoretical
01:51:32 They're just gonna talk about the heart of gibhuggers. Think about what if they did
01:51:36 battalion
01:51:38 uh
01:51:40 The battalion the legion
01:51:45 I like le I like legion it kind of sounds like league but more violent
01:51:49 Yes, like roam roam roam like roam
01:51:53 Next next voicemail is not a voicemail. It is an image. So here here it is. Let's see what we got
01:52:01 uh
01:52:03 Okay
01:52:04 What is
01:52:05 So we so we've got
01:52:07 We've got a whole all right, so ben saint in the middle here
01:52:11 Can I just have just had a little phone session with my dad about the rise of american fascism? I feel better
01:52:17 Maybe it'll be okay. Oh, I see vermark performing nazi salute. I don't know why i'm connected to that
01:52:23 But okay, this is a dab the so-called dad. Oh the so-called dab. Oh
01:52:29 Okay, these that string should go from me to the dab to the vermark salute. Okay. That's fucked up slime corp israeli flag
01:52:38 Jew jewies. Oh, not jew. Oh, okay. This is a
01:52:43 nuzla nuzla conquest of a hat looks like a nazi hat. Oh
01:52:47 destroy israel
01:52:49 No
01:52:52 Damn this makes me really got gut. This makes me rethink everything
01:52:59 It's just it's all true. I like I like it's all I guess I mean, it's all it's all right here in black and white
01:53:06 I like that he used the picture. Maybe that's the best
01:53:10 Picture of me dabbing is me at the the rfck lecture
01:53:13 It's a pretty it's a pretty good picture of me dabbing. That's really great. I love that. I'm in like the dark hood
01:53:19 Uh, I love this I approve of this 100% and
01:53:24 You know what? I just said the n word too. So it all it all comes together lamel. Oh god, ben
01:53:31 It's bad. I'm gonna have to put you down. I'm backsliding
01:53:35 Next next image is uh another image. Here we go
01:53:40 Oh
01:53:42 Geez
01:53:43 Oh geez rick. It's true. It's true. It's ben saint going. Uh, what was I talking about?
01:53:49 I say it all the time on the hit podcast the procrastinators
01:53:52 Was I
01:53:53 Did I was it before we started recording today that I mentioned to you that I was listening back to last episode and I was
01:53:59 A bit disgusted with how much I go uh and uh and pause and that was before the episode started
01:54:05 I was I was noticing it really bad last episode. I've been trying to not do it as much this and repeating myself
01:54:13 starting a sentence with uh
01:54:15 And then a pause and then
01:54:16 Start the sentence. Oh, so I realized uh, okay. So I realized that what I all right
01:54:21 So I think I realized and repeat the start three two or three times while I like think of what I'm actually going to say
01:54:29 In the sentence. It's a bit of a cheat that I
01:54:33 Uh uses a crutch. I think sometimes
01:54:39 Anyway, stay quiet. Actually. No, that's not true. I also do a bit of like
01:54:45 um, yeah
01:54:46 Well, I what I do is I I'm doing it right now
01:54:50 So I don't exactly know where I'm going
01:54:53 but I leave long ish pauses for me to
01:54:57 Find the words that I need to use
01:54:59 Yes, yes
01:55:02 It was weird thinking about that as I was saying it and I'm doing it
01:55:14 Um
01:55:16 Okay
01:55:17 Next voicemail is called paying people to unsub Trixie
01:55:21 three two one go
01:55:24 Ben, how dare you
01:55:26 affect Trixie's livelihood like affecting someone economically is just going too far
01:55:33 Absolutely. You're just like the union during the civil war
01:55:37 Don't you know plantation owners needed slaves
01:55:40 And then the union economically affected them. That's you
01:55:44 You're radical abolitionist ben saint
01:55:47 Uh, not a good look. Um, we've got to abolish Trixie's patreon. Uh, yes, I would like in Trixie two-way and antebellum
01:55:56 Slave-owning cotton plantation owner. Yes, I would agree with that comparison
01:56:02 I wouldn't because there's no way she would be able to organize such a thing
01:56:06 Hey, oh, she couldn't afford it. Ha ha because she's poor
01:56:10 Whoo, yeah
01:56:13 Um, also she doesn't also she doesn't want to be white
01:56:16 So she doesn't she she doesn't like being white. She she wishes she could become a trans
01:56:22 A trans racial individual. She wishes society was ready for that
01:56:25 So that's a little different too. So it's not a it's not a one-to-one comparison
01:56:30 But uh, you know
01:56:32 It's a metaphor
01:56:35 Was it uh, was it this week that Trixie made that
01:56:38 That's that's substack post about being a bitch online. Was that this week?
01:56:44 I don't remember. Hold on. I gotta check twitter
01:56:49 There's something about um, I
01:56:52 Trixie I'm going to be positive
01:56:55 It was like some something of a oh, no, it was it was this week. It was the 15th. Yes. Oh
01:57:02 Yeah, it was something of a uh, a walking back of how she treated me
01:57:07 Uh after after she saw someone else. It wasn't really though. It wasn't really though. Well, yeah, I was getting to that
01:57:13 it was just like
01:57:14 an attempt was made but like
01:57:18 It really wasn't like I'm going to
01:57:21 Make amends. I'm going to not be a bad person. It's oh, no
01:57:25 Being a bad person is bad for me
01:57:28 economically
01:57:29 Um, so I will just not do that anymore. It's not about it's not about caring that she hurt
01:57:35 People or myself or whatever. It's just that the repercussions. It's yeah, uh, we're bad and that sucks for her
01:57:42 She's she's literally in in in so many words. She's just saying uh, I got owned
01:57:48 I should probably not do that or I'll get owned again
01:57:52 Yeah
01:57:53 in in this this article really annoys me
01:57:56 because
01:57:57 what it says
01:57:59 This is okay. She she's
01:58:01 She's adopted. She started to adopt this whole like like positivity thing. She's like no, I'm I'm different now
01:58:07 I'm I'm like I've left all the hate like I've left all the hate out of my heart now. I'm only positive
01:58:13 I only I only like things right
01:58:15 Um, and she's and then this started she says I'm not I'm over. I'm done with being a bitch
01:58:20 I'm not going to be mean anymore being mean
01:58:22 Is bad being nice is good, right? And this is in
01:58:27 Not not as an apology but sort of as a response to yeah to the who are these podcasts
01:58:33 appearance
01:58:34 And to that and it's very it rings completely hollow for many reasons
01:58:39 But the thing that galls me the most about it is that yeah, it's it's adopting this stance of like
01:58:44 I'm no longer going to be mean. I'm being nice now. I'm above I'm above being I'm above petty
01:58:50 arguments and and spite and and and uh drama and bile, right?
01:58:55 But this comes as a response to her doing something aggressive
01:59:00 and getting
01:59:02 Owned for it getting backlash. It totally fell on its face and failed. This is literally just
01:59:08 She's posturing now like she's like she isn't
01:59:11 Gonna attack anyone but like she did she literally she attacked us. She came after us. She tried
01:59:18 To hurt us with the what the who are these podcasts?
01:59:20 She wanted us to get made fun of us to get a backlash people to say hey, these guys suck. I hate them
01:59:27 Uh, it failed
01:59:28 But that's what she was trying to do. She was trying to hurt us
01:59:30 And it's only because the attempt failed that now she she'll walk it back and be like
01:59:35 I'm not about I'm not about attacking anyone. No, no, I'm actually not
01:59:39 Like that at all. I don't do that kind of thing. I'm I'm only nice
01:59:43 Right. It's like the way she
01:59:46 After her after after her attack fails. It's so easy to be like
01:59:49 Attacking's lame. Actually, you know what being aggressive being the aggressor. That's cringe actually. I'm not um
01:59:57 I'm just gonna I'm just gonna let things roll
01:59:59 Yeah, the way after you try and you fail because you're too weak and nobody cares what you think
02:00:04 the way it reads is is definitely like
02:00:07 Not from the perspective of someone like say for example, it worked and she didn't get backlash for it. Yeah
02:00:13 I don't think she would come to the same conclusion because the way it reads is like
02:00:18 It's it's like bad for me
02:00:21 To be a bitch online
02:00:23 Because it comes back to bite me
02:00:25 It's not that I feel I feel bad about what I did
02:00:29 It's just I guess I shouldn't do it again
02:00:32 She says I don't think the results of operating that way have been positive for me. I e I got owned
02:00:38 I got corn cobbed
02:00:41 Uh
02:00:43 Yeah, I mean it's it's
02:00:45 We'll see we'll see
02:00:47 Whether she actually stays with that. I don't I mean I I know I know that it's just completely hollow
02:00:52 And if she ever and if she ever feels like an opera if she ever senses an opportunity
02:00:58 To attack us and hurt us she'll do it. Of course. This is all total empty posturing
02:01:03 Just hot air. Yeah, right
02:01:05 um
02:01:07 But but she can't but she can't because she's weak
02:01:11 She's weak and she can't do anything about us. Uh, she wishes she could
02:01:15 But she can't so this is this is the next best thing to pretend that she doesn't want to anymore
02:01:20 Uh, oh well
02:01:21 That's life. I guess
02:01:23 um
02:01:24 Next voicemail is called what?
02:01:27 three two one go
02:01:30 All right guys who what win where why of retcon?
02:01:34 What's gonna happen at the next retcon? What are you gonna do?
02:01:38 Everybody ask this there's not much more to what
02:01:42 What you I don't know
02:01:45 Shut up shut up. No, I don't know. I don't know the answer to this question
02:01:50 We haven't thought about it. We're gonna play pikmin 2
02:01:57 Like any given thing could happen when you
02:02:01 Give when you when you come to visit in january will that be radcon 4.5?
02:02:06 I
02:02:07 Don't want to record anything. I just want to hang out. So well, we didn't record well
02:02:11 We didn't record anything at 3.5 either or no, we sort of did
02:02:15 Well a little bit we sort of did there was new goal. There was new goal remember that
02:02:20 um, but like uh, that was a beating uh, like
02:02:26 Uh, the the point of that right hit around
02:02:29 Around organizing pcphq or something. I don't fucking remember not not even it wasn't like a big
02:02:35 Not even pcphq. It was just about like whether nate should move to virginia
02:02:40 Yeah, and it was just like oh everyone's meeting i'll fly over
02:02:44 Yeah, because it was fun because I like my friends
02:02:47 It was fun me and munchie were talking about this a little while ago and like radcon 4 3.5 was like the stupidest and like most
02:02:53 pointless
02:02:55 thing of all time
02:02:57 And like practically speaking like there was absolutely no reason for you to come and be there for it
02:03:02 But like we're still glad you did because it ended up being fun
02:03:06 in spite of the fact that like
02:03:09 The reason for it was so asinine
02:03:14 Uh, there was no need for nate to
02:03:17 Get together with trixie and like hang out literally your house just to talk about
02:03:23 this
02:03:25 Was it literally like they couldn't organize getting into a call together
02:03:29 On discord. I mean you would think they could just do a call together. You would think that would be I think that was it
02:03:34 I think it was that they were always on a different sleeping time or like
02:03:39 Trixie was hard to get in touch with for a call and nate was like, I guess I can't
02:03:43 Is it I guess I'm just gonna have to go there physically and talk to them
02:03:46 Is it just that trixie was like so unreliable that nate was like fuck it. I'll just go there in person
02:03:51 I vaguely remember that being much of the reason. Yes. That seems impossible even trixie even for trixie. That seems unbelievable
02:04:01 I mean, I know she was always very hard to get a hold of
02:04:05 But wow
02:04:07 Wow, okay
02:04:10 Yeah, well, obviously there was like
02:04:12 They were gonna look at places nate and michelle. Yeah
02:04:16 But they didn't so there was a reason to go there, but they didn't what was it?
02:04:21 Whatever. I don't think I don't think they did
02:04:25 But no no no because um
02:04:27 Because they weren't talking about moving to boston because that was in boston or brain tree
02:04:34 Yeah, so so they couldn't have been going house hunting for virginia houses
02:04:38 Yeah, so it was all yeah, it was all theoretical. They they got together in person to talk about
02:04:45 Should we move somewhere else so it couldn't have been about like scouting out the location
02:04:49 Yeah, they literally could have just had a fucking voice call about it and gotten like the exact same amount figured out
02:04:54 I think I think we all decided this
02:04:56 Nevertheless, it was fun to hang out and you know
02:05:00 All the other stuff was was cool and we it ended up being a good time
02:05:04 But like yeah, the reasoning behind it was so goofy
02:05:08 Uh
02:05:10 Yeah, I that's where I got my iam games shirt that I still had I lost mine. I don't know where my iam game shirt is
02:05:17 Uh, you're not games anymore. I'm not games. I'm not games
02:05:25 When you when you make a game do you stop being games? I think we think you become even more games
02:05:33 Uh
02:05:34 Nobody knows
02:05:37 Well, at least you'll be able to get a saberspark 64 t-shirt
02:05:41 To replace it god. I hope so god. Can I just can I just say fucking hate listening to saberspark?
02:05:46 He sounds so annoying. He's so obnoxious
02:05:52 His voice
02:05:57 He doesn't sound like a human being he doesn't inflect like a normal person
02:06:03 I don't have like a youtuber voice but like extreme. Yes. Yes. He has this bizarre like
02:06:09 It's like he's trying to do like a radio announcer
02:06:11 But like he doesn't know how and it just comes off like the most stilted and like artificial thing
02:06:16 Uh, I've met him in person and he sounds normal. It's kind of the same
02:06:22 As with uh with with I love Kim possible a lot. I love Kim possible a lot
02:06:26 Legitimately sounds like she has a speech impediment in her music music in her in her videos
02:06:32 And she talks really fast and she yells a lot and she takes forever to say nothing
02:06:37 And she sounds like she's got a speech impediment in person. She doesn't in person. She sounds like normal
02:06:43 And I don't know why why do they do this?
02:06:46 That I notice the thing about myself when I would record like voiceovers for hypocrite or whatever
02:06:52 Talking off the cuff in a podcast or with a person is very different from reading and speaking
02:06:59 So I would put on a voice unintentionally because I'm trying to like
02:07:04 I don't know. I'm not even really know why I'm changing my voice, but it just happens
02:07:09 And I feel like unless you notice that you just do it forever
02:07:14 Yeah
02:07:15 maybe uh
02:07:18 You know you might yeah, maybe I'm maybe I'm throwing stones
02:07:21 Maybe I'm in the glass house here throwing stones because like maybe if I read more scripted content, I would sound weird as well
02:07:28 I mean
02:07:29 Did you script your Winnie the Pooh videos? No
02:07:34 Okay, so it wouldn't feel different. I hardly script. I hardly ever script anything. I didn't script um
02:07:41 Yeah, with the with the Winnie the Pooh videos and with tbap too
02:07:44 I would just go in with notes and I would just go in with like points to hit that's a convo. So
02:07:50 It's a little different. Yeah
02:07:52 It's sometimes there would be it's impossible to have a full script for a conversation between two people
02:07:57 True, but sometimes there would be there would be bits that we would think of that
02:08:01 We would want to deliver and we would make a note of like, okay at this point, you know
02:08:06 Make make a joke about make this joke, right? But they wouldn't be like written out and scripted
02:08:11 They would be just like a little note that I would take a cue from
02:08:15 Uh, yeah
02:08:17 Uh, that's right
02:08:18 So maybe I'm
02:08:21 Don't have any actual
02:08:23 Bases to criticize. Maybe I would be just as bad. I don't know. Maybe if you did that audiobook
02:08:28 You'd you'd you'd find god fucking oh lillia. I fucking hate him
02:08:33 Just fucking let me let me make you some free money idiot you fucking moron die
02:08:42 Law he stole it from me. I was gonna be the guy, but he just doesn't care
02:08:49 Ah

02:09:49 Well, good news. I do not consider myself sufficiently informed on the matter. So
02:09:56 I'm not
02:09:58 sufficiently informed on the matter, but I have
02:10:01 watched a few videos of by this guy who used to live in china
02:10:04 Okay, and he has opinions about how china loves to
02:10:09 Like emit the air of them being a growing superpower that's going to become the most powerful
02:10:16 Nation in the world. Yes, and in reality
02:10:19 They're they're kind of it's kind of a front. They're not really doing as well as they'd like people to think they're not
02:10:24 They're not as powerful as they
02:10:26 pretend to be
02:10:27 Yeah, because they used to be more
02:10:30 like
02:10:31 lifting everyone up, but now they're more
02:10:34 Or
02:10:35 He had to leave china. He was having a really good life in china. I can't remember the name this youtuber
02:10:40 Um, he was having like a real good life in china working and living and and all that
02:10:45 And he had loads of friends and he spoke chinese fluently and it was like there for years and then slowly
02:10:51 like
02:10:52 something in government changed and
02:10:55 It was just sort of becoming worse and worse for a lot of people
02:10:59 And at the same time they were becoming more
02:11:01 There was more like nationalistic pride
02:11:04 um, and
02:11:05 like
02:11:06 Oh americans are the reason for all your problems. And so it's it's all it's it's muddy and not like
02:11:15 Not what you would expect given
02:11:17 Vague notions of china being like a looming threat that's going to take over the world from american
02:11:23 Or other western media. I saw a tweet this week
02:11:27 Someone was making fun of and then they posted four screenshots of headlines
02:11:33 That all claimed to be claiming that like, oh china is china's momentum is slowing down
02:11:40 You know china is stalling out china is not as powerful
02:11:44 It's not it's not, you know, gonna keep growing and growing forever like they claim
02:11:48 But I guess the idea was that people have been saying that for like a long time
02:11:52 Like people been saying that for years and they keep having to say it. I was like, no, no, no
02:11:56 It's kept growing but like now it's stalling like now it's stalling. Well, yeah
02:12:00 I mean, I don't know whether this one youtuber has all the information. Yeah, I just know that he did live there and he's
02:12:08 For years. I'm like, I guess he has more of an understanding than I do. So yeah, whatever
02:12:13 I just I just don't know
02:12:16 I have no I have no insight into this whatsoever. I believe that I can take over china single-handedly
02:12:24 All I need is a butter knife and
02:12:28 15 minutes, you know
02:12:30 Wait, I gotta check
02:12:33 Gotta check bitcoin
02:12:35 No, you don't this makes me want to check bitcoin
02:12:37 No, you don't no doesn't bitcoin dropped a bit this past week. It may be bound rebounding
02:12:47 But you hopefully Ben are not gonna rebound and buy into it
02:12:50 Listen ice I have said that if I thought bitcoin was going to the moon
02:12:58 I would buy it. Yeah. Yeah
02:13:00 It's only a question of do I think that is going to happen and I genuinely don't know
02:13:05 Uh, it's just
02:13:10 It could it it's it's at a position where I think it could make another big leap
02:13:16 But it could also likely
02:13:18 I think it's more likely that it will continue to grow slowly for a very long time
02:13:23 And crash in the in the future at some point. I think I don't think it's going to like zoom up, but
02:13:30 Why do I think I know anything? Yeah
02:13:33 I mean true
02:13:35 I mean true
02:13:37 Well, okay, never mind never mind about that. Um
02:13:41 Next voicemail is uh may mayday
02:13:44 Dishane desk chain
02:13:47 three two one go
02:13:50 Okay
02:13:51 First time voicemail a long time. Listen. Oh, what up? My name is may mayday. Dishane
02:13:57 Uh fellow trans woman. What's up? Give love you big inspiration. Anyway, um
02:14:04 I'm actually just here to talk shit about Trixie
02:14:06 A trans person that I don't respect
02:14:09 Okay, yeah, that fucking appearance of one of these podcasts is like, oh dear. Oh my as a fellow trans woman who, um
02:14:17 finds it really
02:14:19 Difficult to do a fan voice because I'm afraid of coming across like this is what a man thinks a woman sounds like so I see
02:14:27 um
02:14:29 Yeah, it's a big ouch
02:14:32 Like, okay, fine. Um
02:14:35 Also while I'm at it their scripts have never been good and I don't understand why people are going on about how like
02:14:41 Oh, they're they've really fallen. They've really dipped. They've really dropped their scripts. I mean, who are these podcasts?
02:14:47 Incredibly lazy and rush. Who and who's like they've needed at least two more drops
02:14:53 I
02:14:55 People really underestimate how
02:14:58 Much DeVoo really did to make those videos watchable back in the day. Oh
02:15:06 It's really painful. It's real. I don't know either of you have
02:15:10 bothered watching any of the anime outfit
02:15:13 videos, but not yeah
02:15:16 The scripts need a lot of polishing
02:15:19 Um, I have not watched like an entire video. I've seen little bits and pieces here and there and my my impression is that they
02:15:27 lean pretty heavily on just kind of recapping
02:15:31 the events of the of the
02:15:34 anime
02:15:35 Which is whatever
02:15:37 and uh, yeah, I've heard that uh
02:15:40 DeVoo, well, I've heard a lot of people say that like DeVoo was the reason the videos were good back in the day
02:15:46 Uh, but I don't know. I haven't watched the new one. So I don't really have any
02:15:51 strong opinion on what they're like myself
02:15:54 I don't know gave you anything to add. I've uh, I listened I watched the first
02:16:00 Up to the Digimon one I think
02:16:03 um
02:16:04 and
02:16:06 The first world was bad. It was just a recap of the show the other ones were sort of
02:16:11 Had more to about like the the the external like nature of the show where when it came out and stuff
02:16:18 I feel like
02:16:19 talking about the idea that Trixie's
02:16:22 Scripts for anime videos were always bad
02:16:26 It may be true
02:16:27 In it in the sense that the only reason
02:16:30 I believed a lot of what she said was because I didn't know anything about anime and I just assumed
02:16:36 The things she was
02:16:37 positing or throwing out there were like
02:16:40 informed and smart and whatever
02:16:43 But I don't know whether I can make that judgment exactly because I haven't done
02:16:47 My own anime research and then gone back and listened to those videos to figure out whether or not they were smart or
02:16:53 Like surface level on the I mean on the subject of like anime knowledge
02:16:58 I don't have yeah
02:16:58 I don't have any room to criticize it because like I don't know that much about it
02:17:03 And so I can't say like oh, she did or did not know what she was
02:17:08 talking about
02:17:09 in terms of like
02:17:12 In in terms of like other
02:17:14 Aspects that she might have talked about in her
02:17:18 So much in her anime videos been like her other stuff again her after dark stuff in like her vlog content and stuff
02:17:23 I know
02:17:24 That I definitely feel at this point that like there may have been a time that I might have like
02:17:31 I might have respected her opinion about stuff
02:17:33 But I have come to understand that I just don't think she is smart or knows what she's talking about or or like
02:17:39 Has much of value to say and I don't and it has retroactively made me think that like lots of things that maybe I would have just
02:17:47 Accepted as an opinion before now. I have to shake my head and be like well. That's just fucking dumb
02:17:54 Uh, yeah, so I don't I don't know
02:17:57 Yeah, no, that's not true for everything but for some things. I I feel
02:18:01 uh
02:18:02 my
02:18:04 Because just yeah, and any anything that I didn't know about myself
02:18:08 Anything that I did not have a personal opinion on that she said I might have gen I would have generally just taken her word for it
02:18:14 But now I've it has to I have to question everything
02:18:18 Uh, and you know often the the questioning does not lead me to a positive
02:18:24 Conclusion about the yeah content. I guess I guess the the thing that also
02:18:30 I'm not sure about is the people who do know
02:18:33 About this the the things she talked about. Um, I haven't seen people
02:18:39 Saying in comments
02:18:42 Anywhere that much when it you know when they were happening
02:18:46 The Trixie didn't know what she was talking about
02:18:48 So I feel like she had a basic grasp enough to make a video on these subjects and I was
02:18:53 Like at minimum acceptable
02:18:55 I feel like now that Trixie has gone off the rails
02:18:59 Yeah, uh, it's easy to look back and say well, they were always bad, but I didn't think it at the time
02:19:04 I don't know if that's true
02:19:07 You know, I I I think it's okay. I think it's a combination
02:19:10 I I think it's
02:19:11 There is there are some things that I now would think more negatively of just because I know
02:19:17 More about the person who's having them who's saying them. I think but I think it's also
02:19:23 That like she has just gotten worse
02:19:26 Insert like I don't think she could make
02:19:30 Asterisks war sucks now Asterisks war sucks was an interesting analysis and it
02:19:36 Touched on, you know, it was it was pretty like, you know, honest about like
02:19:42 Feelings and stuff. I don't know. I feel like it was a good little series
02:19:46 And now she's she's a different person now and like now she's on this whole thing about like
02:19:51 I
02:19:52 Don't know she's she's like gone into this like contrarian positivity thing and she's all just like I like things now
02:19:59 Digi bro was bad because because he didn't like things, but that was actually just a character
02:20:04 I was playing that wasn't really me
02:20:06 That was just a character Trixie is good Trixie likes things Trixie is nice Trixie's positive
02:20:13 And I just feel like it doesn't come from an emotionally honest place and I feel like it would not
02:20:17 I don't feel like she could write something that I would be like
02:20:20 Hmm. You make an excellent point. Hmm. That speaks to something that I feel
02:20:25 Yeah, is relatable anymore. I suppose a lot of
02:20:29 The the content of the videos that she made was not merely
02:20:36 This anime is good. Um, it's it's like
02:20:40 Using the anime as a framing device for talking about the internet or her
02:20:46 self yeah, or like
02:20:49 various
02:20:50 Things that people can relate to on an emotional level
02:20:54 And that's that's you know
02:20:57 People like that. That's okay. I feel like if she tried to do the same stuff now
02:21:01 She would not relate to anyone because she is
02:21:05 So
02:21:06 Different she's such a she's such like a closed
02:21:10 You know, you know like she's so cagey. She doesn't she doesn't tell anyone what she's up to
02:21:14 She doesn't like nobody
02:21:16 I know I know where she lives because I'm smart and I figured it out and it wasn't even that hard
02:21:20 But like nobody knows where she lives because she's like a secretive about it
02:21:23 Like she doesn't uh, she's she doesn't want people to know about her anymore
02:21:29 Uh, and it comes through
02:21:31 In her scripts
02:21:33 This that what you just said about like how the videos are really they're not they're sort of about the anime
02:21:38 but they're really about like
02:21:41 They're about the host
02:21:43 Yeah, I've been thinking about that
02:21:46 Tim tim rogers has made me think about that lately like those videos are not like they he does talk about the game
02:21:51 But like the the point of those videos
02:21:54 I really think is just for him to talk about himself, which is like fine. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that
02:22:00 um
02:22:01 But it's true of just I think it's just true
02:22:04 Of youtube I saw a video that was a criticism of
02:22:09 It was a a specific philosophy tube video where like some someone who worked for like a university who was like an actual philosophy
02:22:18 Professor gave like wrote like an essay about like, you know
02:22:22 Learning philosophy from philosophy tube
02:22:25 Is kind of like not a great way to do it
02:22:27 Because those the philosophy tube videos
02:22:30 Are only sort of about philosophy like the the point of those videos is not to is not principally
02:22:38 To exposit ideas
02:22:40 But to profile the host right the point of the videos is to
02:22:45 Feature the personality that makes them and I think that's true of so
02:22:50 That's true. I think that's just true of like everything
02:22:53 I think that's like the point of youtube the point of youtube is to provide a platform for people to
02:22:59 nominally talk about stuff you might be interested in video games you like movies you like whatever but the point
02:23:05 Is for them to sell themselves to you as someone that you like and that you want to give money to
02:23:13 And I don't know
02:23:15 I'm not even talking about tricksy anymore. Although it's true of her as well. It's true of everyone
02:23:19 I don't think uh, yeah, that's probably bad. That's probably a bad thing
02:23:25 I mean, maybe I'm my my brain immediately goes to someone like tom scott who is
02:23:32 Yeah, obviously very well recognized because of his videos being very popular
02:23:36 And he's got his signature look and the way he talks and he's like it's tom scott
02:23:41 I like tom scott. I see tom scott and I click sure. Um, but the content
02:23:48 I don't know whether I could describe it about being about tom scott
02:23:52 Other than the fact that it's things that he thought would be interesting to put into a video
02:23:56 And in that sense, I don't know whether there's anything wrong with that
02:24:00 I don't know. I guess there's there's there's certain aspects of parasocial
02:24:04 Like there's a there's a gradient I guess here's here's where it could be more about the host than it is about the stuff
02:24:10 That is being talked about what what if I phrased it like this. What if I said that the the business model
02:24:16 Regardless of the actual like content of the videos or how educational they are the business model of youtube is not
02:24:23 explaining things
02:24:25 Educating people the business model of youtube is to make people like you invest people in you
02:24:31 Sell them on you as someone they want to give money to
02:24:37 By whatever means yes, I think that's only
02:24:41 Due to the fact that most youtube channels are run by an individual and not a company
02:24:46 Because if it were if it were all companies it would be the same thing
02:24:49 But like to get people invested in the brand or whatever
02:24:52 Well, yeah, yeah, okay. I get okay. Yeah, I guess
02:24:57 I guess in a way that's kind of the point of any brand
02:25:01 And some brands are just a person
02:25:04 So I guess maybe I'm not really describing anything new, huh?
02:25:09 Yeah, in fact, you might be an idiot Ben saying
02:25:13 Perhaps perhaps. Let me just check bitcoin again real quick. No
02:25:18 Oh, it crept up a little bit. Ah, it's creeping back up toward it. It dipped below six hunt 60k
02:25:23 But it's creeping a little bit back up towards it
02:25:27 I hope that it doesn't like
02:25:29 Pass 60k and then shoot up again because it's like oh, oh, we've we've beaten the resistance point. We're past the resistance point
02:25:39 Whatever fuck it
02:25:41 um
02:25:43 Duh, what were we talking about youtube?
02:25:46 Whatever man
02:25:48 Yeah, Trixie sucks. Uh, that's all I have to say
02:25:51 One last thing about that. Okay. Uh, male is uh fem voice is tough
02:25:58 Yeah, and I totally get the
02:26:00 the the the the
02:26:03 the aversion to
02:26:05 I guess I guess flippantly or like without practice put on a voice
02:26:10 That people can hear and make judgments. I'd rather perfect it in secret and then suddenly start using it
02:26:16 I don't know if that's possible. I feel like your voice would gradually change
02:26:20 um
02:26:21 But it's I I don't want to I don't want to without having
02:26:26 under undergone like a rigorous
02:26:29 training
02:26:30 It's just start doing a voice off the top of my head because it's gonna sound
02:26:34 Very bad
02:26:37 Hmm
02:26:38 Just like it would be with any sort of accent thing you're trying
02:26:44 Probably yeah, probably yeah
02:26:47 um
02:26:48 okay
02:26:49 Uh, one more voice mail this one is uh
02:26:53 This isn't like they used another website that's fast upload
02:26:59 Okay, you got it open it's called bends bends crass and cast formerly nates
02:27:07 You got it wait wait, that's the joke
02:27:12 And press it needs needs feed and seed formerly chucks
02:27:19 Well, it doesn't make any sense because
02:27:21 Sneeds feed
02:27:23 wait
02:27:24 Sneeds feed and seed
02:27:28 I'll end with eed
02:27:30 Yeah, so your brain automatically goes chucks
02:27:34 Suck and suck
02:27:35 So if this is okay, so if it's bends crass and cast formerly nates then it would have been nates crete and kate
02:27:43 So that doesn't make any sense. Yeah, this is okay
02:27:47 Are you are you ready?
02:27:49 Yes, okay three two one go
02:27:52 I mean, have you been following the uh the the kyle written house stuff?
02:27:56 The the details are iffy in my I mean in my corner of the internet obviously everyone thinks he's he's guilty
02:28:03 If he gets an acquittal
02:28:06 the messages
02:28:08 White people
02:28:10 Yeah, why bring such a large gun?
02:28:12 Yeah
02:28:14 what
02:28:15 I thought the message is the message is white people
02:28:20 I thought it was going somewhere else
02:28:22 I'm not sure exactly what the message of that was supposed to be
02:28:27 uh
02:28:30 I thought it was going to be I thought I was going to end on like what did I say?
02:28:33 I said like, you know white people go out and kill protesters
02:28:35 I thought it was going to end on a dramatic beat of like me
02:28:38 You know the music stops and I say white people go out and kill protesters
02:28:42 Uh, but it didn't so I guess it subverted my expectations
02:28:47 What a strange voicemail. That was a strange voicemail. Oh, we got another one a new one 17 minutes ago
02:28:54 It's called rod surling the crypto zone. Yes, please
02:29:00 Are you ready? Yes. Okay, three two one go
02:29:11 Imagine if you will the world in which the only rational option would be to invest in bitcoin
02:29:17 Impossible why it is not so in the mind of ben saint internet comic artist and game developer extraordinaire
02:29:25 What if you knew for a fact that your money would double after you invested
02:29:29 Forget that in this scenario the whole point of the speculation market that bitcoin relies on would be deflated
02:29:34 Because it relies on some people losing out for others to make gains
02:29:38 Which is made impossible when the stock rise and fall is made predictable to everyone
02:29:43 Or imagine that bitcoin became the only currency and you would become a literal
02:29:47 Vagrant in a mad max wasteland if you did not invest
02:29:50 These are the scenarios we wrestled with in the crypto zone
02:29:54 Where ben saint goes when he must once again justify why he still feels the subtle temptation to invest in bitcoin
02:30:01 Though at the same time admitting that they are a scam pyramid scheme with necessary victims
02:30:05 Not the least of which is the environment
02:30:08 Gotta get that bag i guess
02:30:11 If i wrote to radcon so that ben saint becomes secure enough in his finances that he no longer feels that
02:30:16 Survivalist instinct that tempts us all to slice the achilles tendon of our federal man to steal his meat
02:30:23 And his crypto wallet his meat
02:30:27 Uh that is a completely that is a very emotionally
02:30:32 Honest that is an that is exactly how it feels. I am living in the crypto zone
02:30:38 All the time
02:30:39 That's very eloquently put as well very eloquently put. I love i'm gonna fucking voice grail that one
02:30:45 Yeah, voice grail rod serling goes right to the voice grail
02:30:49 And and ser it's an honor to have you among our esteemed
02:30:53 Right, you you said you said it you said it better than I ever could have
02:30:57 uh
02:30:58 Yeah, I I do uh
02:31:03 What more is there to say you just hit the nail on the head that that music should play every time you check bitcoin
02:31:11 Yeah, it should it should
02:31:13 Uh can we get elia's r2 start editing in the
02:31:17 The twilight zone music whenever bitcoin comes up
02:31:22 Elia's are uh, I'll get I'll get you I'll get you the music. I will get you
02:31:26 I will get you the music. Uh, we're gonna make it we're gonna make it happen. This is a new bit
02:31:32 Yeah, um
02:31:35 Congrats, okay
02:31:37 Anything else? Are we are we done?
02:31:40 I suppose we are
02:31:42 God
02:31:44 another pcp
02:31:47 Gone behind people have been complaining that they're not four hours long
02:31:51 Yeah, I saw a couple people were like I got so used to four hour long podcast and this one's only two hours and 15 minutes
02:32:00 I don't even know how we were able just the two of us to go on for four hours
02:32:05 These days I don't because nothing nothing happens to me anymore
02:32:08 I just fucking sit in my room and I work on my gain and I lift weights
02:32:13 That's all I do
02:32:15 We just gotta finish these projects. Yeah, and we can talk about them
