00:00:00 The Pro Crastinators Podcast
00:00:30 Hello everyone! Welcome to a PCP episode. That's the Pro Crastinators Podcast for the layman out there.
00:00:38 I am the best guy ever. And uh...
00:00:42 Boom! Gotcha!
00:00:44 Layman? More like layman. Wow.
00:00:47 That's Ben Saint, always before hurtful feelings.
00:00:51 I've just brought a hot take to the table, and it is a sizzlin' on the griddle.
00:00:57 We've got, uh, hopefully to win Hippocrit.
00:01:02 Let me tell you the story of me old bones.
00:01:10 It all started in... I forget. Now you've distracted me. Now I can't remember my story.
00:01:15 Shit. Well, sorry about that.
00:01:17 Little Aurora Mage is here.
00:01:20 Am I a demon, or am I a mediton ex?
00:01:23 Are we human, or are we dancers?
00:01:26 Um, uh, and we've got Munchy.
00:01:29 Layman, more like low main, I say, preparing my dish to serve.
00:01:36 Well, happy Halloween season, everybody!
00:01:41 It's not keto!
00:01:44 I forget who said it, but we have a commenter who said last episode,
00:01:49 can there be a single episode where Ben doesn't mention his diet?
00:01:54 Why would you want that, idiot?
00:01:57 Yeah, Ben's a man of and for, exclusively.
00:02:00 His diet, commenters, fuck, fight me.
00:02:04 That's censoring that you're trying to censor my very being.
00:02:08 That's true. We should talk about our costumes that we're all wearing.
00:02:12 Yes, it's a Halloween close enough episode.
00:02:16 Yeah, we're all wearing them, as you can see, on screen in front of you right now.
00:02:21 Oh my god!
00:02:23 I have a cream sickle colored onesie.
00:02:30 It is a footed pajama onesie.
00:02:32 It is cream sickle covered, it's a very pleasant yellow.
00:02:36 And then I have moose antlers, and I am moose.
00:02:40 He is moose!
00:02:43 Okay, most moose aren't cream sickle colored.
00:02:47 What's going on there?
00:02:49 I think you better stop saying things like that before I encase you in the stone again,
00:02:53 and you won't be able to get out, because it will be so thick,
00:02:56 and you won't have any tools with you.
00:02:58 That's true. I might be able to get out in my dreams,
00:03:01 because I'm Freddy Krueger, guys!
00:03:03 Haha! Look at my fingers!
00:03:05 I'll cut you in the dream world, where you are right now.
00:03:09 Freddy escapes to New York, too, the other day, for the first time,
00:03:17 and he was like, I'm gonna fuck you, and it was exactly like Rick and Morty.
00:03:23 Like me?
00:03:24 I haven't seen a single 80's movie, let alone 80's.
00:03:28 Dude, I've been on a big horror movie bender,
00:03:32 because I just got into, finally, some tiny bit,
00:03:36 I was saying this the other day, of cinemastical shit,
00:03:39 I was watching all this monster movie shit,
00:03:41 and like I watched, just yesterday I watched The Exorcist,
00:03:46 I didn't finish, but I was watching fucking Freddy Krueger, Nightmare on Elm Street,
00:03:51 I was having a great time, I absolutely love it,
00:03:54 and Freddy is Kino, is all I have to say about that.
00:03:58 Ben, what are you wearing today?
00:04:00 Shit, damn, I guess the world's my oyster,
00:04:04 I guess I can just say anything I want,
00:04:06 and just whoever's editing this episode is just gonna have to go with it, aren't they?
00:04:10 Just put you in a cardboard box.
00:04:13 I am...
00:04:17 Oh no, I was about to say that I'm Kirito from Sorted Online,
00:04:22 because that would be really funny, but then I thought about it,
00:04:25 and they realized that people of my age and stature actually go,
00:04:31 actually do things like that, and unironically...
00:04:35 Ben, I met a Kirito cosplayer not too long ago,
00:04:40 just living his life as a Kirito cosplayer.
00:04:43 No, on Halloween, there was a Kirito cosplayer three years ago,
00:04:47 and he was walking around the library, and I walked up to him and said,
00:04:49 hey, is that Sorted Online?
00:04:51 And he said, yeah, and I was like, huh, okay, and then I walked away.
00:04:54 We were like, do you know Ditch Bro? I love him!
00:04:58 I went to a comic expo yesterday, it was called MICE, Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo,
00:05:08 and did not check who was going to be there.
00:05:12 I met Casey Green and Abby Howard, who it was like...
00:05:19 You met Casey Green?
00:05:20 Yeah, Casey Green was there, I shook his hand.
00:05:22 Shit, I forget what he made, I remember the name.
00:05:25 He made the anime club in the gun show.
00:05:27 The anime club!
00:05:28 Oh, dude, that's...
00:05:29 And he makes fucking, what's it called?
00:05:31 He had a portfolio there with originals from Anime Club.
00:05:36 He was selling the original pages of Anime Club.
00:05:39 Did you get any?
00:05:40 You could see the blue pencil sketches and the ink layer over them.
00:05:44 No, I didn't get any.
00:05:46 He makes Fat Boy comic, right?
00:05:48 That's the one he's doing now?
00:05:50 I'm not sure.
00:05:51 I know he did, he's a good boy, and nut, and...
00:06:00 What?
00:06:01 I like it.
00:06:02 I don't know about Fat Boy, I haven't heard of that one.
00:06:04 God damn it, he's the guy who makes the comic about...
00:06:07 Isn't it just about him as a character who's the most reprehensible, fat little...
00:06:11 No, that's Womp.
00:06:13 That's Womp.
00:06:14 I'm sorry, Casey Green.
00:06:16 I'm sorry.
00:06:17 Ronnie Filmyaw from Womp, I think, isn't it?
00:06:20 Ronnie Filmyaw?
00:06:21 Yeah, that's the one.
00:06:22 Well, I love gun show anyway, so no insult intended here.
00:06:26 Yeah.
00:06:27 What was I talking about?
00:06:29 Oh, I think the only reason I was bringing up Mice, which is the acronym, was that I actually
00:06:35 saw a guy in some kind of cosplay.
00:06:39 There was like...
00:06:40 I think as I was walking in, there was a guy and a girl, I think, sitting on a bench.
00:06:48 Human Centipede cosplay?
00:06:49 And like, the girl was kind of cute, but they were both too fucking old for this shit.
00:06:54 And the girl was in Wonder Woman cosplay, and the guy was in...
00:06:59 I couldn't identify what it was, but it looked like some kind of anime shit.
00:07:03 And I was like, shut it as I walked by.
00:07:07 Oh, no.
00:07:08 And I gotta say, the whole experience was not...
00:07:11 I didn't like it.
00:07:12 I did not like going in there as a customer.
00:07:15 It felt bad.
00:07:16 It felt predatory.
00:07:17 It felt like I was a sheep walking into a den of lions.
00:07:21 How so?
00:07:22 How so?
00:07:23 I did not want to buy anything.
00:07:25 And even if I had wanted to buy anything, it wouldn't have been enough.
00:07:28 Because it was like every one that I made eye contact with...
00:07:33 Obviously, some of them were more aggressive than others.
00:07:35 But even the softest among them were still pitching in a sort of attempt to get me to buy something.
00:07:41 Oh, that was like at the county fair.
00:07:44 It was just...
00:07:45 It's like I was just inherently at odds with them, and they were like...
00:07:49 I was immediately like...
00:07:52 Even Casey Green, he didn't put the heat on or anything.
00:07:57 He didn't try and hard sell me his shit.
00:08:00 But even he was clearly wanted me to buy something.
00:08:05 Because that's why they're there.
00:08:07 And I was mad.
00:08:08 Because I had wanted to sign up to be a tableer at this convention.
00:08:11 And I think I could have probably done it if I had applied.
00:08:14 It's just that I didn't move...
00:08:16 I didn't live here in time.
00:08:18 And when I moved back to Massachusetts, it was too late.
00:08:22 The deadline was already over.
00:08:24 And I was there, and I was like...
00:08:25 Man, I would like this so much more being on the opposite side of this.
00:08:28 I would much rather be the lion.
00:08:31 I think I might enjoy that in this scenario.
00:08:34 I do not like being the sheep.
00:08:36 That's cool.
00:08:37 I understand what you mean.
00:08:38 I felt that way a lot about the county fair.
00:08:40 I think I talked about it in the PCB before.
00:08:42 It's just a whole cabal of weird, bizarre conspiracy theory wallets
00:08:48 that prevent radio waves from accessing your credit cards.
00:08:52 And overpriced hot tubs to install on your mansions.
00:08:56 It was just a whole range of shit that people are trying to force on you
00:08:59 over and over and over again.
00:09:01 Really aggressively.
00:09:02 Just constantly.
00:09:03 I felt socially.
00:09:05 I felt like I was just...
00:09:09 The people tabling were in charge.
00:09:11 They had all the social power.
00:09:13 They were the artists, and everyone else was the public.
00:09:17 And I felt inherently denigrated by the scenario.
00:09:22 I was like, I should be...
00:09:23 This is such a humble event that I don't even know why I felt this way.
00:09:27 But I was like, I should be on the other side of the table.
00:09:29 I should be the one with the power.
00:09:31 People should respect me.
00:09:33 I should not respect anyone.
00:09:35 I think most people there kind of wouldn't have that problem
00:09:38 because you actually are a comic person.
00:09:40 So you probably feel like that's just where you belong.
00:09:43 I did.
00:09:44 I felt like nature had twisted around.
00:09:48 Why are you spooked?
00:09:49 I'm spooked by the idea of being on the other side of the table.
00:09:54 Oh, fair enough.
00:09:56 It's spooky.
00:09:57 You have to stand there and smile and get people to buy things.
00:10:01 I do not have the confidence to get people to buy things.
00:10:04 Here's the thing.
00:10:05 I would enjoy it because I would not care if anyone bought anything.
00:10:09 I would not care at all whether someone bought...
00:10:13 I mean, obviously I would like it if they bought my shit.
00:10:15 But I would not be there to be like, ooh, I hope I make some money by selling my wares.
00:10:19 I don't care.
00:10:20 It would be good to just be fun.
00:10:22 I would be there so that people like Abby Howard and Casey Greene would be like,
00:10:26 ah, yes, this is my peer.
00:10:28 That's my only goal.
00:10:30 And you know what?
00:10:31 I'd have accomplished it just by getting there.
00:10:33 I wouldn't care about feeding his family.
00:10:35 He cares about chasing that class.
00:10:37 I would just have a good time and meet people and it would be great.
00:10:40 It's a romantic rung on the indie comic Cursus Honorum to be able to not only publish your stuff in a real store like Ben has done as well,
00:10:52 but also attend some sort of a small time convention.
00:10:55 I feel like that's just a ride of passage and a romantic ideal.
00:10:59 You know what?
00:11:00 I've never tabled a convention.
00:11:02 That's just what people do, but I've never done it.
00:11:05 And it's weird.
00:11:06 I don't think it's weird.
00:11:08 And being on what I consider to be the wrong side of the equation.
00:11:11 And history.
00:11:12 And history.
00:11:13 Made me really want to do it and also made me really want to get back to work and get my shit done so that I could go to events like this and have more stuff to show and be like, yes, this is my stuff, idiot.
00:11:29 Put down the dwarf fortress, Ben, and pick up the pen already.
00:11:32 Get back to it.
00:11:34 Yeah, you know me.
00:11:35 Ever since I've been like a comic guy now.
00:11:38 You know me, Ben, a dwarf.
00:11:40 Yeah.
00:11:41 I've had thoughts of like, oh, wouldn't it be fucking sick if I made a little book of Bel-J for whatever.
00:11:49 And I had little plushes of punk.
00:11:52 And I was standing there like, hey, you want it?
00:11:55 It's yours, my friend.
00:11:57 Like, you know, just like goading people over to it.
00:11:59 Which you'll have to find it first.
00:12:00 Dude, I think clump.
00:12:01 I think clump.
00:12:02 I think clump.
00:12:03 I think punk pushes fucking help.
00:12:06 Pump.
00:12:07 Plushes would sell pretty well.
00:12:09 They'd be cues.
00:12:10 The thing about that is that, I mean, you'd like, they'd have to be all handmade.
00:12:14 Like, like, like getting a, like getting like a fucking setup to like mass produce plushes is like super hard and impossible or make sense.
00:12:24 Speaking of plushes, I have something.
00:12:26 Wait, mate.
00:12:27 It's for the love of God.
00:12:28 I want to hear all about that.
00:12:29 But we have not finished our goddamn Halloween costume introductions.
00:12:32 Can we please just do...
00:12:33 Ben, what the fuck are you wearing right now?
00:12:35 Just tell me.
00:12:36 Just tell me.
00:12:37 Fine.
00:12:38 I'm dressed as a...
00:12:39 Casey Green.
00:12:40 I'm dressed as a...
00:12:41 I'm dressed as a...
00:12:43 Casey Green.
00:12:44 Look at you.
00:12:45 Yeah, I'm Casey Green.
00:12:46 I can see it.
00:12:47 That's right.
00:12:48 It's just Ben with the name tag.
00:12:49 Hey, kids.
00:12:50 This is Casey Green.
00:12:51 I hope you all got your faces ready to sing a little tune here.
00:12:55 Let's go!
00:12:56 Good.
00:12:57 Having a baby and the baby is you.
00:12:59 Okay, anyway.
00:13:00 Gib, what are you wearing?
00:13:01 What's your costume?
00:13:02 Oh, me.
00:13:03 I'm a pirate skeleton.
00:13:05 I was from Pirates of the Caribbean, number movie one, and I was a dead guy.
00:13:11 I still have my little piece of gold.
00:13:14 Good.
00:13:15 Well, that's great.
00:13:17 I'm dead.
00:13:19 Ah, shit.
00:13:21 Who else has left?
00:13:23 Munchy?
00:13:24 No, no, we never did Munchy.
00:13:25 Mage.
00:13:26 Mage, right?
00:13:27 Mage is...
00:13:28 Mage is Mage.
00:13:29 Yeah, Mage is Mage.
00:13:30 I just put on an extra pair of wings, like little bat wings to complete my evil demon
00:13:35 look and also opened my second pair of eyes just for you guys.
00:13:40 We appreciate that.
00:13:42 Well, okay.
00:13:43 Thank God we've got those inter...
00:13:45 Wait a minute.
00:13:46 Oh my God.
00:13:47 She's open, not just...
00:13:48 What's happening?
00:13:49 The earth's rumbling, people.
00:13:50 Do you feel that?
00:13:51 Nothing.
00:13:52 Nothing.
00:13:53 What's happening?
00:13:54 Not another calamity.
00:13:55 There's a zombie.
00:13:56 What the hell is that thing?
00:13:57 Oh, here he is.
00:13:58 What the fuck is that thing right there?
00:14:00 Oh God, help us all.
00:14:01 Could it be?
00:14:02 Could it be?
00:14:03 I don't...
00:14:04 Is it him risen from the grave?
00:14:05 I see an empty Max Revive on the ground.
00:14:07 What's that next to it?
00:14:08 Oh God, he got into it.
00:14:09 He got into the Max Revives.
00:14:11 Oh no.
00:14:12 It's all drains.
00:14:13 It's the PCP guy.
00:14:15 There it...
00:14:16 No, that's not the PCP guy.
00:14:17 That's the legally distinct PCP guy.
00:14:20 Legally distinct PCP guy.
00:14:22 And he's legal.
00:14:24 Oh, he really is after three years.
00:14:26 That's really scary.
00:14:27 Get him off the screen.
00:14:29 All right.
00:14:30 He's back, everybody.
00:14:31 He makes Halloween.
00:14:32 He makes Halloween.
00:14:33 He's so legally...
00:14:34 He's so legally distinct that he's...
00:14:36 Yeah.
00:14:37 He's bulletproof.
00:14:38 We are.
00:14:39 We're all bulletproof now.
00:14:40 It was drawn by Mage because she's like...
00:14:43 She's a necromancer, I guess.
00:14:45 She made him come out of the ground.
00:14:47 I'm a demon.
00:14:49 Demon and necromancer, same thing.
00:14:51 You just have powers.
00:14:52 Whatever.
00:14:53 Get over it.
00:14:54 Yeah, whatever, dude.
00:14:55 Does that make a big deal of it or anything?
00:14:57 Yeah.
00:14:58 Well, you wanted him.
00:14:59 I wanted him.
00:15:00 Yeah.
00:15:01 And he's back now.
00:15:02 He's legally distinct.
00:15:03 You can stop bulletproof.
00:15:04 Oh no, he's scared of us.
00:15:05 He's running and he's hiding in the background there.
00:15:07 Yeah, don't worry, guys.
00:15:08 Okay, he's more scared of us than we are of him.
00:15:12 I mean, we are horrible beasts right now.
00:15:15 If you encounter him in the wild, just spread your coat out.
00:15:18 Try and make yourself look as big as possible.
00:15:21 Do not run.
00:15:24 Do not run.
00:15:27 Face him down.
00:15:28 Just look at his face.
00:15:29 Make loud noises like you're a crazy person.
00:15:32 Yes.
00:15:33 That's how we've kept him in check.
00:15:35 Throw sticks and rocks.
00:15:37 Do not run.
00:15:38 Okay, that's out of the way.
00:15:39 Moving on.
00:15:40 Mage, what the hell are you saying about plushes?
00:15:42 I want to hear it.
00:15:43 Yeah, today was a very exciting day.
00:15:45 It was related to the Pokemon community today,
00:15:47 but I'll skip all the details, I guess.
00:15:49 Oh my god, it's Belldom Day.
00:15:51 Shiny Metagrosses people, they're out there waiting for you.
00:15:54 Dude, where's my phone?
00:15:55 I gotta pull my phone out.
00:15:56 It's a weekly night, so...
00:15:58 I'll be doing it.
00:15:59 I'm going out to get them.
00:16:00 I'm switching to headset.
00:16:02 I'm switching to headset.
00:16:03 I'm going out.
00:16:04 I'll do the rest of the PCP remotely.
00:16:07 Actually, Ben, it doesn't actually start for us.
00:16:09 Wait, no, it does start in 10 minutes.
00:16:11 Five minutes, yeah.
00:16:12 Well, plenty of time.
00:16:13 E.
00:16:14 Well, it was a big journey, a big, big day for me.
00:16:17 I'm not sure how many details I want to go into,
00:16:20 but however, one highlight of this whole thing
00:16:24 was that I discovered a Build-A-Bear thing,
00:16:27 and they had Pokemon in it,
00:16:29 and I had my very first Build-A-Bear,
00:16:31 which is a low on Vulpix, and I love it.
00:16:34 And I named it Tyga, and it's on my desk right now,
00:16:39 and it's life-size.
00:16:40 I love it so much.
00:16:41 Can we get a picture of that?
00:16:42 Hell yeah.
00:16:43 Or show notes.
00:16:44 A low on Vulpix is very hoggable.
00:16:46 That's a good one.
00:16:47 That is true.
00:16:48 Fucking Build-A-Bear is really sick.
00:16:50 I love Build-A-Bear.
00:16:51 I have very, very fond memories of the game.
00:16:53 I prefer a low on Ninetales.
00:16:55 Much more competitively viable.
00:16:57 Look at them there.
00:16:58 Okay, question about this, though.
00:17:00 Isn't kind of the point of Build-A-Bear
00:17:02 that you're supposed to customize it,
00:17:04 but this just looks like a generic low on Vulpix.
00:17:06 I didn't want to dress it up.
00:17:09 Oh, so you had the option to dress it up,
00:17:11 but you chose not to.
00:17:12 Oh, okay.
00:17:13 You could have given it thigh highs.
00:17:15 Oh, God.
00:17:16 Jesus Christ.
00:17:17 And like a choker.
00:17:18 And like a choker, lace collar.
00:17:20 I didn't like any of the clothes options.
00:17:22 You could have given him, you know,
00:17:23 crotchless panties, you know.
00:17:25 Stop.
00:17:26 Stop.
00:17:27 Stop.
00:17:28 Stop.
00:17:29 Stop doing this to my pure baby.
00:17:30 Don't start a bell.
00:17:31 Yeah.
00:17:32 Stop that.
00:17:33 You're all banned.
00:17:34 Yeah, that's true.
00:17:35 You're not allowed to speak to me or my son ever again.
00:17:38 I just have him like, he's got like,
00:17:41 what if you come out and you've built your bear
00:17:43 and you just go, hey, I made this bear
00:17:45 and then one, he's got a big old fat cigar
00:17:48 in the one hand and the other one,
00:17:50 he's got a big old stack of pornography.
00:17:53 Tiny little like knitted pornography,
00:17:56 but you can still read it kind of.
00:17:59 Oh my God.
00:18:00 Oh my God.
00:18:01 There's a, there's a baniere.
00:18:03 Where's that baniere?
00:18:04 I want it.
00:18:05 Do you like baniere a lot?
00:18:07 Yeah.
00:18:08 Oh yeah.
00:18:09 I like low-punny because it's fuckable, you know.
00:18:11 What if you went into a builder bear
00:18:13 and you said, make all the homestuck characters.
00:18:16 Would they do it?
00:18:17 They don't have the template.
00:18:20 You go in, you pick up a head.
00:18:22 They don't have the courage for that.
00:18:24 Useful.
00:18:25 Yeah, like when you go in,
00:18:27 they have already pre-made heads and empty bodies
00:18:30 and they fill up the bodies.
00:18:32 I've got an empty body.
00:18:34 I've got an empty skeleton.
00:18:36 No, no, no.
00:18:37 I was meaning like I have no soul, like I'm depressed
00:18:39 because they couldn't make homestuck figurines.
00:18:42 The interaction with the lady that was like filling it up
00:18:45 was quite awkward.
00:18:47 Really?
00:18:48 How so?
00:18:49 Yeah, she had a Pikachu on her bag,
00:18:51 on her back in a bag.
00:18:53 And so I thought maybe, maybe she likes Pokemon
00:18:55 so it won't be as awkward,
00:18:57 but she kind of seemed like a bit of a,
00:18:59 bit of a normie.
00:19:01 Such a normie.
00:19:02 Yeah, there it is.
00:19:03 Such a normie.
00:19:04 I wish I had that sound bite ready to go.
00:19:06 I do have that.
00:19:07 Gib actually prepared that sound clip though.
00:19:09 So, one day.
00:19:10 Prepare for what?
00:19:11 For what?
00:19:12 For what are you preparing?
00:19:13 I don't know.
00:19:14 Don't worry about it.
00:19:15 Once the bombs drop Mage,
00:19:17 we're not going to be able to hear you say things like that anymore.
00:19:19 So we're just going to play it down.
00:19:20 The only currency that's going to have any value
00:19:22 is going to be, you know, Mage audio clips.
00:19:25 MP35.
00:19:26 It's going to be the new currency.
00:19:28 Listen, listen.
00:19:29 The Petrodollar is cratching our over-extended oil needles
00:19:33 and octopus tentacles
00:19:35 are retracting from the world.
00:19:37 We're not going to be able to sustain our currency anymore.
00:19:39 And what do we turn to?
00:19:41 Some people say crypto.
00:19:42 Some people say nuclear waste.
00:19:44 And I say Mage audio clips.
00:19:46 Yeah, funny audio clips.
00:19:47 I'm literally printing money right now
00:19:49 with every single word I'm speaking.
00:19:53 Oh, yeah.
00:19:54 Belden Community Day.
00:19:56 Halloween episode.
00:19:58 Let's talk about Pokemon Go again.
00:20:00 Fucking, I got so many Belden.
00:20:03 I caught, I looked at the Pokedex.
00:20:06 I caught 150 of those fuckers.
00:20:08 Damn, that's like all the Pokemon there are.
00:20:10 Yes.
00:20:11 I caught 150 and I traded one of them with my brother
00:20:17 right at the end and I evolved it.
00:20:19 And it's like a 98% lucky Metagross
00:20:22 with like almost maxed out CP.
00:20:24 And then I finished him off
00:20:25 and he's like the biggest, strongest lad.
00:20:27 That's crazy.
00:20:28 There he goes.
00:20:29 Right.
00:20:30 Gen 4 came out guys.
00:20:32 I sure did.
00:20:33 My absolute favorite generation.
00:20:35 I caught two Banearies.
00:20:36 I still can't get my Mamas one.
00:20:38 I know, you have to wait for another wave for that.
00:20:40 But yeah, I'm super excited.
00:20:41 Gen 4 has been my favorite gen ever since I was a kid
00:20:44 because it was the first one that I did, obviously.
00:20:46 And I've always had a soft place in my heart
00:20:48 for like Starling and all the stars and stuff like that.
00:20:51 I'm walking my Chimchar right now.
00:20:53 I am really excited because I don't know anything
00:20:58 about the past gen 3.
00:20:59 So like this is all going to be new and fun and cool.
00:21:01 Like when I saw Baneary, I was like,
00:21:03 what the fuck is that?
00:21:04 It's got like weird brains coming out of its head.
00:21:06 But it's just fluff.
00:21:08 It's so cool.
00:21:09 He's like a zombie Pokemon.
00:21:11 Woo, Halloween.
00:21:13 I can't wait for Munchlax to come.
00:21:15 I'm so excited.
00:21:16 He's coming dude.
00:21:17 He's coming.
00:21:18 I don't know if you're going to get him.
00:21:19 I don't know how they're going to replicate.
00:21:20 I just assume eggs maybe.
00:21:22 He's really, really hard to get in the games.
00:21:24 I was watching a video.
00:21:26 Here's how you get Munchlax in the game.
00:21:28 Can I explain?
00:21:30 I'm the Munchlax guy.
00:21:31 Please do.
00:21:32 All right.
00:21:33 When you start a copy,
00:21:35 when you start a new game of Pokemon,
00:21:37 Diamond, Pearl or Platinum,
00:21:39 there is an item called the trainer card
00:21:42 and it lists a number there.
00:21:43 But what isn't listed there
00:21:45 is your secret trainer ID.
00:21:47 And your secret trainer ID
00:21:49 is calculated whenever you press new game
00:21:51 and you start a new character.
00:21:53 And this secret ID calculates
00:21:56 the placement for Pokemon
00:21:58 within the Gen 4 gameplay mechanic
00:22:01 which is slathering honey on trees.
00:22:03 In Gen 4, you can slather honey on the trees.
00:22:05 And if you come back in five hours real world time,
00:22:08 keep in mind you can't manipulate your DS time
00:22:11 like you can for literally every other game.
00:22:13 I don't even know how they fucking calculate it.
00:22:15 But once five hours actually pass in the real world
00:22:18 and you've slathered honey on some bark,
00:22:20 you can come back to that specially marked tree
00:22:22 and pick up the Pokemon.
00:22:23 And these Pokemon are mostly shit.
00:22:25 Like they're almost always terrible.
00:22:26 You've got fucking combi
00:22:28 and it's probably gonna be a male combi
00:22:29 so you can't even get a vetspequin
00:22:30 or you're gonna fucking get a fucking bee doofen.
00:22:32 There's no reason for you to fucking do it.
00:22:34 But based, calculated on your trainer ID,
00:22:37 there are four trees
00:22:39 that could possibly contain a munchlax.
00:22:42 Keep in mind, possibly.
00:22:43 This is not like these are the munchlax trees.
00:22:46 Go here for munchlax.
00:22:47 Munchlax has a 1% chance
00:22:50 to be in a tree calculated by a number
00:22:53 that you can't fucking see.
00:22:55 So you're going to have to go to every tree in Sinnoh.
00:22:59 Do it a hundred times.
00:23:01 Like, and just slather honey on there a hundred times
00:23:05 to make sure that tree doesn't contain a munchlax
00:23:08 and then move on to the next tree.
00:23:09 And there's something like 27 trees or something.
00:23:11 So just randomly, these four trees are calculated
00:23:14 and you have no way of knowing which one is a munchlax or not.
00:23:17 I mean, breed it how?
00:23:18 Like, trade a Snorlax from another game or something?
00:23:20 Yeah, you can, but you would have to have a Snorlax
00:23:23 and you would also have to have a full incense.
00:23:26 Those games don't have a Snorlax?
00:23:28 No.
00:23:29 No, they don't.
00:23:30 You would also have to, if you don't have two Snorlaxes,
00:23:33 you would have to get the National Pokedex in Platinum
00:23:35 because then you can get a ditto in National Park.
00:23:39 In my current Nuzlocke I'm doing right now,
00:23:42 I saw that munchlax is a Pokemon I could possibly get
00:23:45 and I'm like, dude, I'ma get a fucking Snorlax
00:23:47 for my Elite Four team.
00:23:48 By the way, just beat the eighth gym on my Twitch.
00:23:51 Twitch.tv slash definitely best guy ever.
00:23:54 Check it out every Saturday at 7.30 p.m.
00:23:56 Oh boy.
00:23:57 I'm getting ready for the Elite Four right now,
00:23:59 eighth badges, here we go.
00:24:00 Anyway, I wanted to get that fucking munchlax,
00:24:02 but when I see this shit, it is impossible.
00:24:06 There's a zero chance I'm gonna get this fucking munchlax.
00:24:08 You'd just be throwing away your random encounter for the area.
00:24:11 Yep, yep.
00:24:14 Supressing.
00:24:15 Oh god.
00:24:16 Hey, something cool happened in Pokemon Go.
00:24:19 Tell me if anything like this has happened for any of you.
00:24:22 So, there was, so I have my house.
00:24:26 My house does not have any stops in range of it.
00:24:29 There's one kind of down in the corner.
00:24:32 Like it's like around the corner from me,
00:24:35 there's one at a church.
00:24:37 And then a little ways down a side street,
00:24:40 I pass this church like on the way to and from like the convenience store a bunch.
00:24:44 And then a little ways down, like one block down the side street,
00:24:47 there was a stop, a gym actually.
00:24:49 A weirdly located gym in the middle of,
00:24:52 in like this nothing little corner.
00:24:55 I think it's with the new update that they've switched,
00:24:58 and now the gym is the one that I pass on my way to and from the convenience store.
00:25:02 And now that what was for me, the gym is now just a stop,
00:25:05 which is great.
00:25:06 That's very strange.
00:25:07 That is weird, but that's also cool.
00:25:09 It definitely happened.
00:25:11 That place was absolutely a gym.
00:25:13 I have walked there and like stood on their,
00:25:15 Do you have the gym badge still?
00:25:17 In people's corners and like probably wears them out by just walking down the street,
00:25:20 standing on their corner for 10 minutes and looking at my phone and then walking away.
00:25:24 I used to do it all the time.
00:25:26 I do that all the time, dude.
00:25:28 Guys, get a fucking electric skateboard, increase your efficiency.
00:25:31 I'm just telling you, it's such an upgrade for Pokemon Go specifically.
00:25:36 I like the walking.
00:25:38 Hey, it's what fucking...
00:25:40 I don't want anything to add noise to my walk.
00:25:44 I walk through the park and it's really peaceful.
00:25:46 I also don't want to go fast for any reason.
00:25:48 I like that it takes a long time to get from point to point.
00:25:51 But you can be more efficient at getting more Pokestops and stuff.
00:25:54 Because it's more pleasant and I enjoy it more.
00:25:56 I can walk around the park nearby my house.
00:26:00 It takes about an hour to go all the way around it.
00:26:02 We want to shred hardcore on the pavement and make old ladies jump and fucking splash them as you go by.
00:26:07 I'm with you, Nate.
00:26:09 I'm all about that efficiency.
00:26:11 The walk I have is like an aesthetic thing.
00:26:14 You go down the path alongside the river and then you get to one end of the park.
00:26:20 You turn around and you start going up this hill and then right at the top of the hill there's like a gym.
00:26:25 You can just sit on the hill, on the grass and just look out over the whole park.
00:26:30 You sit there, you spin the Pokestop a few times, you beat the gym and you just sit there for a while.
00:26:35 And then you go home when you feel like.
00:26:37 That's what I do.
00:26:38 Having a skateboard would be completely useless for me.
00:26:41 I have a lot of stops in my vicinity so the skateboard really helps me hit them all real fast.
00:26:46 Because otherwise I definitely would not walk.
00:26:48 I don't have a lot of stops where I live so I have to kind of walk.
00:26:53 Yeah, I've noticed your trainer ID says you've walked over 10,000 kilometers.
00:27:00 No, over 1,000 kilometers, not 10,000.
00:27:03 I just want to let you guys know.
00:27:05 The clock just turned over in Pokemon Go.
00:27:07 I have it open and all the Belldoms appeared.
00:27:09 God, fuck this podcast.
00:27:11 I want to be catching Belldoms.
00:27:13 Can we call it here?
00:27:15 No.
00:27:16 Quick other life update.
00:27:17 I just want everyone to know that I've got like, when I record this, I usually sit with like a blanket wrapped around my legs.
00:27:23 And currently my dog has entered that blanket and is sitting on my feet.
00:27:27 And it's the most comfortable and adorable thing in the world.
00:27:30 I'm happy that you have a dog name.
00:27:32 That's such the most positive character development that possibly could have happened to you.
00:27:35 I'm so ambivalent.
00:27:37 I'm going to harvest him for his meat one of these days.
00:27:39 I could not be more ambivalent about your dog.
00:27:42 This is a stepping stone and practicing responsibility to be a fucking dad like how I know you want to be.
00:27:48 I agree.
00:27:49 It's a fun aesthetic thing that is like the platonic ideal is you're a human who eats bread and has a dog.
00:27:55 And it's just great.
00:27:58 How are you so heinous, Munchy?
00:28:02 How are your values so...
00:28:04 I'm the only sentimental person left on this podcast and the only person who cares about the good things in life which are on the way out.
00:28:10 Munchy, we were having a talk before this episode and I want to now grill you.
00:28:14 It's time to get deep into it.
00:28:16 Okay, this isn't...
00:28:17 Okay, we've all talked about how we hate college and we'd only do it if necessary.
00:28:23 You're like currently working on going to college right now.
00:28:26 I feel like it's been a big, weird elephant in the room and I just want to know why.
00:28:31 Like what is your plan to justify the cost of going to college?
00:28:35 Well, my plan to justify the cost is first of all that my mother's been saving up all of her life for me to go to college.
00:28:40 So it won't be...
00:28:41 You could use that money on anything else, but okay, go on.
00:28:43 Okay, well, she doesn't want to and she wants to use it on me.
00:28:46 And the reason I want to go to college is for a lot of reasons.
00:28:49 First of all, obviously, I like art and I want to continue doing art and I want to do art for the rest of my life.
00:28:55 Do that for free or perhaps for profit as you do now.
00:28:58 Can you let me finish any statement whatsoever?
00:29:02 Okay, I want to get better at art and I want to be taught by a trained professional who has been in the art industry for any amount of time and who I trust their opinion on.
00:29:13 I have been trying, or not trying, but I have been learning things online.
00:29:18 I've been self teaching myself my entire life, but I don't feel like that is a sustainable thing to do.
00:29:24 As it is hard to self teach yourself.
00:29:28 It is not easy to find the right tutorials and to try and mix and match all these different YouTube videos and try and create a through line.
00:29:36 And all YouTube videos are just a standardized formula for the masses.
00:29:42 I want to be able to have a teacher that is able to respond to me personally and is able to give me accurate and in-depth information and good education.
00:29:54 In order to further my art career in ways that I can't fully predict.
00:30:00 There are going to be ways that the teacher could teach me things that I wouldn't think to look up, that I wouldn't know that I am missing, that I wouldn't know that I need to know in order to be a good artist.
00:30:13 So I want to do it for purely academic reasons.
00:30:16 I want to do it so that I can be a better artist and I genuinely believe that I think being in a college or any school type scenario, but I am past high school now and my high school didn't have an art program.
00:30:31 But any sort of classical training and sort of classical teacher helping me in any sort of tutors or something like that.
00:30:40 I think that will be extremely beneficial to me as I think I learn better that way and I'm more proactive in learning anyway.
00:30:47 And that's the academic reason.
00:30:49 Social reason.
00:30:51 It's so weird to hear Munchie talk seriously.
00:30:53 What?
00:30:54 It's so weird to hear you talk like seriously just in a calm voice.
00:30:58 It's not bad, it's just weird.
00:31:02 I want to hear the rest.
00:31:05 The second reason is the sort of social reason.
00:31:10 I have been cooped up in my room for a long time.
00:31:13 I have been cooped up in my room doing internet stuff for a long time.
00:31:17 And as such, I have let my life run me by completely and utterly.
00:31:23 My friends who I cherish with all my heart, my offline friends who honestly I like way more than a lot of my offline friends.
00:31:33 I have not seen them in so long because I've been so single-mindedly dedicated to achieving internet e-fame.
00:31:43 What does this have to do with college though?
00:31:45 I don't get the connection there.
00:31:46 I'm getting to that.
00:31:48 Hold on.
00:31:50 They have gone and now they're in college and I can't see them anymore.
00:31:54 All of my social interaction is nil.
00:31:57 And if there's one thing that I think you can't knock college for in any way is that it's a positive social experience right down to the fact that you are living with someone who you don't know.
00:32:14 Aside from all of the classmates you will meet, especially in art college where everyone will be of a similar mind to you.
00:32:22 Everyone will be of a similar predisposition to be an artist, to be creative.
00:32:27 Aside from all of that and how you're going to be able to network with other people, young, up-and-coming artists, artists of my age, people who I relate to more than random people on the internet.
00:32:38 People who I will be able to maybe even collaborate with or resonate with.
00:32:42 Aside from that, the fact that I just simply will be in a room with another person and I will be able to maybe not fully agree with this person and everything.
00:32:51 Maybe I will have differences with this person.
00:32:53 Maybe I'll be able to have arguments and people have-
00:32:55 I mean, you can just get a roommate.
00:32:57 What?
00:32:59 You talking about just a dorm mate?
00:33:01 Yeah.
00:33:02 That's weird.
00:33:03 That's kind of a weird thing to be excited about.
00:33:06 You can just get a roommate.
00:33:07 Living with someone else is not special.
00:33:08 Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
00:33:09 That's what I'm doing is I'm getting a roommate.
00:33:12 I would say that's a terrible reason right there.
00:33:14 Throw that one right out.
00:33:15 I don't want to hear it.
00:33:16 Well, I just said other social reasons as well.
00:33:19 I'm saying that this is an emblematic thing that I will have to interact with more people in my life and that's what I want to do.
00:33:27 The only question behind all of this is, is this worth the debt that will be accrued or the monetary expense?
00:33:34 Because I feel like a lot of this can be done for less money than a college education.
00:33:39 I've already done the entire financial system.
00:33:42 Obviously, I'm not going into this blind.
00:33:45 I have been on the podcast and I've said that I don't think that college is cool.
00:33:50 And I understand the financial risk.
00:33:52 I've calculated it at all.
00:33:54 I know how long it will take to pay it off.
00:33:57 And I know how much money I'll be going in, like you'll be able to pay like down.
00:34:03 I know the risks.
00:34:05 And I think that the positives outweigh the negatives.
00:34:10 And everyone in my family is supportive of me.
00:34:15 My mom is more than happy to help pay because she's wanted me to go to college all of her life.
00:34:22 I think that the financial risks, while they are risks, I think they are worth it in the end.
00:34:29 I want to be able to get an industry job.
00:34:32 I want to be able to be an illustrator out in the industry, creating, I don't know, the future lays in store for me.
00:34:42 But to something to the effect of maybe working at Disney.
00:34:47 Maybe that's a pipe dream, but I would like to be able to do it.
00:34:50 I like Disney.
00:34:51 I think it's a great company.
00:34:53 I would like to be there.
00:34:54 I would like to be able to work on logos freelance.
00:34:57 I would like to be able to do industry stuff like that.
00:34:59 I'm not saying that I would abandon the internet or anything, but I think...
00:35:04 I don't care if you do.
00:35:05 I'm just wondering about that.
00:35:07 I think having this outlet is a good idea economically.
00:35:13 I think it's a good, or having the diploma that is, you know, with our colleges.
00:35:18 There's obviously risks and balance, and you know, it's going to be a large investment upfront.
00:35:23 I think ultimately it will pay off.
00:35:25 And even if it was like, you know, like I can't use the art degree for the things that I wanted to,
00:35:30 and it would have been fine if I didn't have it.
00:35:32 I still think that the positive social experiences...
00:35:35 There's one other thing that I didn't get to mention, by the way.
00:35:38 It's that I will be able to live in Boston far, far sooner than I would be otherwise.
00:35:44 And I love the city of Boston.
00:35:47 It's my favorite city on earth.
00:35:49 I've been traveling a lot recently to really great places.
00:35:53 I've been fortunate enough to travel to very old cities like Rome and see the sights.
00:36:00 But nothing has captured my attention more than Boston.
00:36:04 Boston is everything that I like about cities and everything that I want in cities.
00:36:08 And I want to be able to be there as soon as possible.
00:36:12 Then just move there and pay rent. Just do that.
00:36:14 I have no idea when I would be able to do that.
00:36:16 I have no idea when I would be able to do that in any sort of reasonable timeframe.
00:36:22 Of course, guys, I know that there are other ways to achieve what I want.
00:36:27 But don't you understand that these are all of these things in one package?
00:36:31 These are all of these things in one thing.
00:36:33 All it is, this all strikes me as these are the reasons that the millennial generation went to college
00:36:39 and the vast majority of them regret it immensely.
00:36:43 And so I'm just wondering, what's the difference here?
00:36:46 Alright, I'll jump in here.
00:36:50 By the way, you owe me nothing and don't have to defend anything to me.
00:36:55 I went to uni for similar reasons.
00:36:58 I wanted to know what it was I wanted to do.
00:37:04 And I thought animation might be something that I was interested in.
00:37:07 But I came away with a degree that I think is kind of pointless for me
00:37:13 because nobody is going to care about whether or not I have a degree.
00:37:18 They just want to see my animation and how good it is.
00:37:21 So art degrees, they're just like a formality really.
00:37:26 But the teaching I learned, the things I learned that were important
00:37:29 and very much so, the social aspect, the fact that I was living alone for the first time
00:37:36 made me grow a lot as a person.
00:37:42 In many ways, I would have just stayed like a weird baby if I stayed at home.
00:37:47 Some of my friends, or one of my friends, he commuted every day to uni.
00:37:55 And now he looks like the guy at the end of Aunt Boley.
00:37:59 Yeah, he stayed with his parents and commuted to uni.
00:38:05 And the rest of us in the friend group were living in the town.
00:38:09 And by the end of the three years, it was quite obvious that we had become more mature and he hadn't.
00:38:15 And we just sort of stopped talking to him.
00:38:17 And it was kind of brutal, but it really crystallized for me how important it was that I was doing this.
00:38:24 Even though it's a lot of money and I'll probably never pay it off.
00:38:28 See, that's the important part for me right there, at the end there.
00:38:33 I don't know how it works in Britain, but you can't shake that.
00:38:37 I don't have to start paying it back immediately.
00:38:40 I only start paying it back once I reach a certain income threshold.
00:38:44 So I'm more okay than someone in America.
00:38:48 So I don't know exactly how it works over there.
00:38:51 But from what I understand, as soon as you stop, you have to start paying back interest or something.
00:38:57 I think a lot of the reason why...
00:39:01 I'm going to use Tom as a sort of case example here.
00:39:04 Tom, please listen to this episode and correct me if I'm wrong or anything.
00:39:08 But if you recall, he talked about this on the PCP before, that his father just said,
00:39:11 Don't think about the debt. Don't think about it. Everyone has debt.
00:39:14 There's no reason to do it. Just go to art college because it will be a good opportunity.
00:39:19 And I feel like the distinction here is that I'm not in the dark about any of the faults of college.
00:39:25 And I've accurately prepared for them.
00:39:29 I have all of my finances in order.
00:39:32 I'm not going to be able to pay literally 100% of it off immediately,
00:39:36 like my first time that I get a debt notice.
00:39:40 But I have calculated the amount of time that it will take.
00:39:44 And it's not a big deal. It's like 10 years. It's not a huge deal.
00:39:49 How is that not a big deal?
00:39:52 I'm sorry, but how is that not a big deal?
00:39:54 A lot of the time, it's like 30 years or something.
00:39:57 I understand that 10 years sounds like a long time. It's a decade.
00:40:00 But in the grand scheme of things, if I'm going to be able to get these four years of the experiences,
00:40:08 which I think I'm in tail for, 10 years does not sound like a bad deal.
00:40:15 So you mean 10 years after you're done, right?
00:40:18 Yeah.
00:40:19 So you'll be 32 when that's done?
00:40:21 Yeah.
00:40:22 And then whole time, you'll be paying...
00:40:25 Okay, all right.
00:40:27 Well, I mean, if you think it's worth it...
00:40:30 I'm not your fucking dad. I'm not trying to dissuade you.
00:40:33 I'm simply trying to... We've all recognized it.
00:40:36 We have talked a lot of shit about college here.
00:40:38 And it would be weird to not bring it up when Bunchie is going to college soon.
00:40:42 I don't know.
00:40:43 I mean, you say that that's not a big deal, but suddenly it's like, oh my god.
00:40:47 What exactly are you spending 10 years in debt for to move to Boston and have a roommate?
00:40:55 And to further my career?
00:40:57 You can do that for like $500 a month.
00:40:59 You could split a room with someone in Boston.
00:41:01 To further my career, to have academic credentials, to become more proficient in art,
00:41:09 to do the things that I love in the city that I love,
00:41:13 and be able to meet new people and network and have more opportunities in my life.
00:41:17 That's what I'm paying for people.
00:41:19 See, those reasons make perfect sense. They make perfect sense.
00:41:22 But, you know, people have regretted it.
00:41:24 Well, there is no but.
00:41:25 I'm not trying to tell you not to.
00:41:26 When it comes to art specifically, it is kind of important to have somebody over your shoulder
00:41:34 like if you have a specific question to have somebody who can give you a specific answer.
00:41:40 Because everyone on the internet has a different idea of how you're supposed to get good at some sort of art
00:41:46 and you'll never really understand how to improve fast enough.
00:41:51 There is no answer.
00:41:53 There is no answer.
00:41:54 There is no right way to do it.
00:41:57 I know that, but there are some fundamental things that just increase your ability to do whatever you want more and quicker.
00:42:06 Me, right? I went to college, but my professors did not teach me anything that I could not have read in a book, you know?
00:42:18 Did you go to an art college?
00:42:20 Yeah, I had the books, I had the textbooks, and the professors told me the same stuff.
00:42:27 I thought you got a calculus degree or something. I thought you got like a physics degree.
00:42:32 Yeah, you didn't go to art college. You went to liberal arts.
00:42:36 I have some experience with college as well.
00:42:39 First year college, something, art and design, I think.
00:42:44 And all they taught us was like the color theory and some other basic stuff that I already knew.
00:42:51 So it was a little underwhelming.
00:42:55 I don't feel like I learned anything in that year, but I might have learned something in following the year.
00:43:00 The thing is with, I mean, it's not good that they do this, but they have to do it, because they have a wide amount of skills.
00:43:11 The point of the first year is to get everybody on the same page so that they teach all the basics to people who don't know.
00:43:17 For those who don't know, let's go over this.
00:43:20 So expensive.
00:43:22 I know, but like...
00:43:23 The thing is though, I'm pretty sure I was put in the slightly above average course of art and design, because they were like levels, I think.
00:43:33 So I was put in the advanced ones. You think we know color theory by that point?
00:43:40 Well, okay. I mean, I agree with Mage. Here's where I come from.
00:43:44 I totally accept the value of an art education. Absolutely.
00:43:48 I went to college. It was a STEM, and it worked out well financially. It's not like a passion project or anything, but it worked out well.
00:43:54 So yeah, college totally makes sense.
00:43:57 But I contrast the two realities in my mind.
00:44:00 Okay, there's one reality where one goes to art school, works on it, and then applies for a job later, has to deal with debt for an amount of time.
00:44:07 Okay, fair enough, and they'll have more credentials, maybe they'll have significantly more skills who knows.
00:44:11 There's another path in my mind of where the same person, I don't know, gets like some meaningless job, but they're earning money as opposed to losing money.
00:44:20 So okay, that's cool. What about the art?
00:44:22 Well, what if this person in their off time, which is exactly how my YouTube career has been, has been like offline, they like work on a webcomic for four years.
00:44:32 And in four years, that's a pretty good amount of time to develop something cool, or maybe not even one thing, but like lots of stuff.
00:44:39 Like they invest their creative energies independently, and they work in that way.
00:44:45 So they're not taking on any debt. And in four years, you can probably make some pretty good stuff.
00:44:50 And I totally accept that you won't get the kind of professor one-on-one exchange thing there, but comparing those two futures, I don't know.
00:44:58 I think that's the ideal situation, in the sense that I don't think that that can apply to not just me, but like the general public.
00:45:08 A person who just tries to draw a lot, while obviously practice is the best way to practice, you still are not going to be able to get the same sort of success
00:45:22 or the same sort of understanding that you would have if you teach yourself.
00:45:28 You could teach yourself on the internet, or you could teach yourself with a professor and you pay for it.
00:45:33 I mean, if you've seen like a lot of certain DeviantArt accounts, where they just draw the same thing over and over,
00:45:41 they are drawing a lot of stuff, but they are not getting better at drawing.
00:45:46 They are getting better at drawing the one thing that they think they know how to draw.
00:45:50 It's important to get advice from lots of different people.
00:45:55 And one of the more direct and powerful...
00:46:01 I mean, it depends on the college, obviously.
00:46:03 I had a good college and it had a good track record, and the lecturers and the people there were really cool
00:46:11 and well connected to important people, like the new people from Aardman and stuff.
00:46:17 It depends on the professors, but it is invaluable if you want that.
00:46:26 It's worth the debt.
00:46:30 Will you be saying that in five years, though, when it's still there, looming?
00:46:34 That's the horror show. That's the true Halloween spook.
00:46:37 The horror of debt is what I live and feel.
00:46:40 I'm out of it, man. Thank God.
00:46:44 But only because I was in the STEM field that pays really well.
00:46:47 I want to ask, because I don't really know how the debt works in America.
00:46:52 How did it work for you? What did it do that made your life bad?
00:46:57 Well, it is a financial burden for some out of time.
00:47:01 In America, I believe the way it works when you take a federal student loan is...
00:47:05 If you want to, you can call them up and be like,
00:47:08 hey guys, can't pay, please just delay me paying entirely.
00:47:11 You get three years of that total that you can split up.
00:47:14 If you lose a job, you get another job.
00:47:16 After that point, you do have to pay it, and if you don't, I don't know what happens, but something bad.
00:47:21 But when you are paying, they work with you and they budget, I think, based on your income,
00:47:26 how much you're going to pay.
00:47:28 But you are continually racking up interest, so you might not even touch the premium or the base or whatever.
00:47:34 It's going to take a long time. The less you earn, the less you're paying into it, the longer it's going to stretch out.
00:47:39 Possibly, probably not forever, but I don't know, a really long time.
00:47:44 So there is an expectation that you will start paying after some amount of time.
00:47:49 I don't think it matters if you make literally zero money.
00:47:53 There's a time when the time runs out and you have to start paying in some amount that they decide with you.
00:47:59 I've refinanced a bunch when I still had the debt and I'm no hero.
00:48:03 Why don't I hear anything?
00:48:07 I don't know.
00:48:09 How are you responding if you can't hear this?
00:48:11 Headphones issues? He's probably just talking to himself.
00:48:13 Yeah, it's funny.
00:48:15 Well, whatever. That was the point. You do have to pay eventually, even if you don't earn enough.
00:48:21 I don't know what happens if you just literally can't.
00:48:24 I know that they'll garnish your wages or something, they'll directly just take the money after a while if you get any job.
00:48:32 So that's the basic gist, I think.
00:48:35 I don't know why that is like...
00:48:42 I mean, maybe they can, but they can't just take all of your money so that you just starve to death.
00:48:48 I mean, I don't know.
00:48:50 Presumably, that's the worst case scenario.
00:48:53 If you get some shitty minimum wage job and your degree counts for nothing, as is the case for a lot of people.
00:49:00 Does the money just keep getting drained and then they get beaten by the police and then they die in the streets?
00:49:06 Does that actually happen? Or is that just what they scare you with?
00:49:09 Maybe to some people. Here's the actual thing to be scared of.
00:49:12 This is the actual thing to scare you on this Halloween night, ladies and gentlemen.
00:49:16 It is pretty scary.
00:49:17 It is pretty scary, but more realistic is it's years later, whatever, you've got your debt, you have a job.
00:49:25 The real terror is that you're not able to get the job you want.
00:49:30 And so you're forced to take some other job doing, you know, like so many baristas working at Starbucks, paying off their thing.
00:49:36 Well, will people turn you away if you have debt?
00:49:40 Sorry, what?
00:49:41 No.
00:49:42 Will a job turn you away if you have student loan debt?
00:49:44 No, I mean, they don't care if you have debt or not, they'll employ you.
00:49:47 But like, what's scary is just that your education didn't really give you like a guarantee of a job.
00:49:55 And then you aren't able to get the great job that you want.
00:49:58 Yeah, but this is alright.
00:49:59 And so you have to take a shittier one.
00:50:00 Yeah, but this is different.
00:50:01 That's not the problem with having debt.
00:50:03 The problem with having debt is that your credit will be bad and you won't be able to get a loan.
00:50:06 I'm painting a picture. There's that.
00:50:08 And then on top of that, you aren't able to live a great life because your wages are getting garnished
00:50:14 because you have to pay off a certain amount of your debt so that your total take-home income is like pennies.
00:50:19 And you have to live in a shitty place.
00:50:21 You can't have the kind of life you want.
00:50:23 Your wages are getting garnished.
00:50:25 Your wages are getting garnished, but that's just you paying what you were supposed to be paying in the first place, right?
00:50:31 In this case, yeah, that's what I'm framing it as.
00:50:33 For your debt.
00:50:34 But they will literally garnish your wages after a certain amount of time though and just take it off the top.
00:50:41 The reason I bring up all of this is because I just want the best future for you much because I care about you and I like you.
00:50:47 Thank you. I appreciate it, Nate.
00:50:48 And that's why I bring all this up.
00:50:49 I'm not mad. Obviously, I'm defending myself.
00:50:52 I'm kind of challenging your life decisions, which I understand is a sensitive kind of topic here.
00:50:57 Well, I mean, it's fine. I just haven't heard anything that's made me change my mind, you know?
00:51:03 Do you fear being naive because I fear that all the time about myself?
00:51:06 Sure, sure. I fear that maybe I won't be able to get an industry job.
00:51:14 And I don't think that will be the case, but I'm prepared and sure that will suck.
00:51:20 But I feel like there's a distinction here that, wow, things might not go my way when I'm out of school.
00:51:30 And, you know, sure, I will have debt and that's not good.
00:51:34 And you don't need to have debt. That's not a natural part of life. It's bad.
00:51:38 Yeah, yeah.
00:51:40 And I might not be able to get an industry job.
00:51:43 But the lessons that I will learn in college can't be taken away from me.
00:51:49 I can't ever lose the academic or the skills that I learned there.
00:51:57 I won't be, no one will be able to take away the social interactions that I have.
00:52:02 No one will be able to take away the experiences that I accrue.
00:52:06 And no one will be able to take away the friends that I meet.
00:52:09 That's technically true of anything, though.
00:52:12 Yeah, when you're gathered around the fire in the dumpster with the other homeless people
00:52:17 scraping the last bean out of the can, no one can take that experience away from you guys.
00:52:21 Yeah, that's yours forever.
00:52:23 I mean, yes. That's not an experience I would want.
00:52:26 So these are experiences that I want.
00:52:28 Yeah, it's technically true that I can have fun without college.
00:52:33 Do you see my reasoning?
00:52:35 It's not even about having fun.
00:52:37 It's about any experience you have is something that can never be taken away from you.
00:52:42 Okay, I wasn't speaking literally.
00:52:44 I don't think they can reach to my brain and take my memories.
00:52:48 Okay, well, here's a more relevant example.
00:52:50 What don't you have as college days?
00:52:52 You don't have to just resign like, okay, Munchy, you know, you're making a bad choice, but don't do it.
00:52:57 No, I'm not resigning. I'm just saying, we've been talking about this for like how many, 20 minutes, 25 minutes.
00:53:02 This is an interesting goddamn topic in my humble opinion.
00:53:05 Well, you're not going to change Munchy's mind.
00:53:08 Well, I don't want to phrase it like that.
00:53:10 I mean, I can listen to reason.
00:53:13 Mage, debates, if this even counts as a debate, are an attempt to convince the audience.
00:53:17 No, we just got to let the baby have his bottle, Mage.
00:53:21 It just, okay, last thing I'll say is it just reminds me of, especially that last stuff you were saying,
00:53:27 on Kanye's album, I think it's late registration.
00:53:31 There's a bunch of skits, or it might be college dropout or whatever, where he's just like,
00:53:35 my dad got so many degrees.
00:53:37 Well, me and mom were starving in the street.
00:53:39 My Christ, he had so many fucking degrees, and he kept going back for more degrees,
00:53:43 and he loved those degrees.
00:53:44 And when I have his degrees now, and I'm going to pass those degrees on to my children,
00:53:48 and when they had burned them from worth, we're going to think, wow, our dad was so educated.
00:53:52 It was so great.
00:53:54 All right, that's a joke, but that's a hyperbolic example of the story here.
00:53:59 Am I okay?
00:54:01 America's fucking scary.
00:54:03 I agree.
00:54:04 I don't really know how that relates to me, in a way.
00:54:08 Because you were talking about how the inherent worth of the degree, which I would argue is objectively false.
00:54:12 I think the value comes within the four years that I'm in college.
00:54:17 I think that's where the true worth of it will lie.
00:54:21 I think the only value in a college education is what it gives you afterward.
00:54:26 That is my humble opinion.
00:54:28 Yeah, the skills increased faster than they would have otherwise been increased.
00:54:34 For the cost of a huge amount of debt, or maybe a little if you go to like community college.
00:54:39 I mean, I don't know.
00:54:40 Oh, lay an egg.
00:54:41 That's important, goddamn it.
00:54:43 It's important, Nate.
00:54:44 I don't disagree with you at all.
00:54:45 I don't know if you guys are trading, Nate.
00:54:46 Like, he's just being a big old scrooge over here.
00:54:48 I know.
00:54:49 He's sensible, but it's just like, clearly, Munchie is going to get more out of college than most,
00:54:56 because he very much wants that.
00:54:57 Why do you assume that?
00:54:58 Why do you assume that?
00:54:59 To get a lot out of it.
00:55:00 Yeah, why do you assume that?
00:55:02 Well, compared to people I've seen in college who just go because their parents told them
00:55:08 to, and they don't really know what they're doing, they rack up debt, they go to college,
00:55:13 and they don't really try very hard because they think of it as just school, and then
00:55:18 they leave college with big debt, and they're like, oh no, I don't have any skills because
00:55:22 they didn't try very hard.
00:55:23 Munchie clearly wants to do this.
00:55:25 So, he's going to get a lot of skill, art skills out of this, regardless of whether he gets
00:55:31 like a job in the industry or not.
00:55:33 He can apply that to like anything he wants to do.
00:55:37 I think that that drive that is like, yeah, he will do good in school and get a lot out
00:55:45 of it because of his attitude.
00:55:47 I think that attitude would serve him well in any, like whatever path he chose, right?
00:55:53 I don't understand...
00:55:55 It would serve him...
00:55:56 Sorry, I'm sorry.
00:55:57 I can finish.
00:55:58 I'm sorry.
00:55:59 It would serve him just as well if he decided not to go to college and just work on his own
00:56:04 stuff, like that attitude would still be there, and that's what it's about, right?
00:56:12 It's about your fucking attitude more so than whether you go to college or not.
00:56:16 In my humble opinion...
00:56:17 Sure.
00:56:18 You guys don't have to walk on eggshells as much.
00:56:20 I'm not going to get mad.
00:56:21 I mean, I fully expect in your minds thinking that I'm retarded, like I don't...
00:56:27 Like it's obvious, but...
00:56:30 All I care about is that it's worth the investment.
00:56:32 That's the only thing I care about at the end of the day.
00:56:35 I don't claim to have...
00:56:36 I don't claim to know the right answer for everyone, but I wouldn't do it.

00:58:33 paying the money like I'm just doing the work I was doing it's also worth it to
00:58:37 mention that I have a man on the inside and I'm not oh shit I'm not going into
00:58:42 this line not only have I researched extensively the college I'm planning to
00:58:47 apply for and I vetted it with all my little toes and hands with my
00:58:52 grippy little hands but also uh Kazi goes there now and everything she tells
00:58:58 me is good and it sounds great all the hard homework all of the fucking like
00:59:05 like weird out there stuff that they teach you would normally think to do it
00:59:09 all sounds like you know good stuff like stuff that I want to learn learn
00:59:15 stuff that I want to be able to know that you can't find like a YouTube how-to
00:59:19 to do so what you tell me munchie is you're going there for a girl all right
00:59:23 throw it in the trash wasting time there goes the money everybody I'm Ben wait
00:59:26 before I'm sorry Nate Nate do you think that actually literally no okay
00:59:32 you know what it probably is part of the equation well okay I'll try like this
00:59:37 Kazi being in Boston is one of the reasons I want to be in Boston but not
00:59:41 one of the reasons I want to go to college I'll phrase it like that okay also
00:59:45 by the way one of the reason I want to go to college is so that I can fucking
00:59:48 form PCPHQ more by the way that's one of the reasons I value your financial
00:59:53 future more than the formation of PCPHQ at least where you are concerned yeah so
00:59:59 yeah everything I say stands it would sure be convenient for me to encourage
01:00:03 you and to go into massive debt so that you'd be around to work with me and yet
01:00:07 I don't so I appreciate me I don't have I'm glad that you've been willing to
01:00:13 challenge me in such a way well good I'm the dad just to be hard but fair to
01:00:18 lay the truth's on the line as I see them maybe I'm wrong in fact I appreciate
01:00:23 research and you looked into things and you know what the curriculum is that's
01:00:26 very encourage I mean I'm obviously like not as aware of like the the money
01:00:30 ramifications because for me the debt is not really an issue yet and it won't be
01:00:36 a big issue ever yeah well no no no no I can just say Britain adults pass on to
01:00:43 their children at their debt is it sure nice no I'm kidding I assume low I can
01:00:48 just I could just you know just throw it in the trash you also just like throw
01:01:00 taxes in the trash if I recall correctly there's like ladies debts that you have
01:01:05 to pay and just don't do this you weren't thinking of Jesse with that sounds
01:01:07 like a Jesse thing I'm sure Jesse as well I'm sure Jesse as well when what
01:01:13 there's some sort of payment that we were that you were talking about unlike I
01:01:16 think it was a shekels for heckles that like you just don't pay some money thing
01:01:20 I forget what it is damn sounds like what a great like a ticket what a promised
01:01:25 land like a what a ticket or something Nate you remember right yeah give there
01:01:30 was something you were talking about some fee to be like on some like housing
01:01:35 thing that you had to pay but you hadn't been paying oh well no I didn't had to
01:01:39 pay it was the government that mixed up the forms and they said I had to pay and
01:01:42 I was really mad it was it was it was it was council tax yeah that sounds right
01:01:48 but I didn't have to pay council tax because I was a student living in the
01:01:51 house but the they they mixed they mixed it up like something went wrong and I
01:01:56 thought I wasn't a student and then angry letters and I threw them in the trash
01:02:00 and then they sent me a court summons and I threw that in the trash and they
01:02:04 never did anything and that all worked out because they can't they don't have
01:02:09 the money to look for me right and I'm long gone I'm fucking long I'm out of
01:02:15 there okay what I'm about to say is not to de-legitimize this conversation
01:02:20 because this conversation has been fruitful and productive but I will say
01:02:24 that like I have been in the PCP for a while now I've listened to the school
01:02:31 sucks podcast I really want to emphasize that I'm not going into this blind or
01:02:36 with way crazy expectations of what I will accomplish I'm talking a lot about
01:02:42 experiences and and industry jobs and stuff like that but I realize that the
01:02:46 future is not as smooth as I would like to think about it and I realize that
01:02:52 there will be trials and tribulations both in school and out but I am taking
01:02:57 what I believe to be an educated decision maybe not the best decision but an
01:03:04 educated decision nonetheless and I have weighed the pros and cons more than I
01:03:09 feel my contemporary ill cap not you guys but I mean like you know like
01:03:13 like millennials at large I feel like I have done more research and am more
01:03:18 confident in that this is a sustainable idea more so than might be normal and I
01:03:27 not trying to say that guys like I know what I'm doing don't talk to me that's
01:03:32 not what I mean I just mean to remind everyone that there might it's
01:03:38 specifically in the comments there might be some offshoot that was talked about
01:03:42 in school sucks that we haven't addressed but I know I know feel free to
01:03:48 comment but like I know I know I always said that college is definitely right
01:03:53 for some people and that could certainly be the case here so you know yeah not I
01:03:57 mean I'm definitely not gonna sit here and say don't do it cuz I like I I went
01:04:04 to college and never used my degree and I'm still in debt over it and I don't
01:04:10 even really care that much I don't even necessarily think it was bad because it
01:04:13 was just like some good years of my life and I like the person that I ended up
01:04:17 being so I guess it all worked out I don't know
01:04:22 yeah my gripes was the first year I had in college it was a pretty good year I
01:04:28 met one of my bestest friends ever there and it was it was funny it was a fun
01:04:32 year yeah see this is why I was supportive of what when she came to me
01:04:36 and told me he was doing it and like he seemed very serious about it like
01:04:41 clearly like there is gonna be good that comes of it even if like the debt is
01:04:45 one thing obviously there's gonna be that to deal with but like everyone who has
01:04:51 debt seems to be okay this whole distance break I think it's gonna be a
01:05:00 bad I know I said I won't be that long of time relatively but that doesn't mean
01:05:05 that it won't be that that it is like fine I totally accept that I am more
01:05:10 financially kind of concerned than your average person my age I'm not gonna say
01:05:14 that I'm great it's just I do worry about it a lot and care about it a lot
01:05:17 being having my future secure financially so you know fair enough fair
01:05:21 enough I get it but I'm not when I fucking leave my job and go full-time
01:05:29 YouTube which is all I think about and you know okay okay this is sort of
01:05:32 tangentially related Nate why do you want to become a youtuber like because
01:05:42 it is the most rewarding experience I've ever had that's why it's scary and I
01:05:47 completely agree because when I when I go to work it's fine when I come home and
01:05:52 work on my projects I feel alive and I love it okay I mean I mean I mean I yeah
01:05:58 I mean and this is in no way me saying don't become a youtuber or that's
01:06:03 negative whatsoever feel free to challenge it you know it just sounds like
01:06:09 like YouTube is just constantly getting fucked so I just I really all I want to
01:06:13 know is what's the experience like like how do you feel as someone who has a
01:06:18 sustainable job that wants to enter at not an unsustainable job but a
01:06:22 fluctuating job does that concern you has that entered your thoughts at all
01:06:26 absolutely there's a major difference with me versus other people which is me
01:06:31 I'm coming into this thing like my whole last couple years has been paying off my
01:06:35 debt building up my financial reserves so then I can make an honest to goodness
01:06:40 serious long-term attempt to make it on YouTube and if that fails have a
01:06:46 contingency to go back which is that that is what I've been building towards so
01:06:50 right I don't think the risks are very high for me at all and like YouTube might
01:06:54 it I might not even fail it just will turn out that YouTube is not as look at it
01:06:59 not as fun anymore you know yeah or not as fun in which case I will be you know
01:07:03 prepared I have a degree in a in a in a good field I've had a job I've got a
01:07:08 resume of work that I can fall back on and use and and find another job if
01:07:13 necessary and like my YouTube career has been honestly going fine with it as a
01:07:17 part-time job and I could continue to do that it's just that I know I would be so
01:07:22 much more like productive and you know and successful like even if I don't even
01:07:27 if I fail like to make it big time as a YouTuber like I could do better than I'm
01:07:31 doing right now because all my time is you know taken up by you know normal job
01:07:35 so like do I worry about YouTube in general failing absolutely I do think
01:07:42 that I am more willing to adapt and change like like for example all this
01:07:48 copyright shit's going on right now I'm gonna I will I will adapt to what's
01:07:53 necessary we Agua itself was a big adaptation to try to figure out how to
01:07:58 survive on YouTube doing we Agua consistently was by far the most
01:08:01 lucrative period for my channel so I know what to do and that's what I would do
01:08:05 instantly when I go full-time doing it like maybe YouTube will just find my
01:08:10 content objectionable and fail and you know I'll have to like stop doing it
01:08:15 entirely because everything will close down except for like Jimmy Kimmel and
01:08:18 shit it's possible it's possible and at that point I will I will just always like
01:08:23 if I if I go full-time YouTube I'm just gonna always try to make sure after I've
01:08:28 got this idea of like I'll do it for a year if it's going well I'll keep doing
01:08:31 it after that point I will switch plans to make sure I have enough money that if
01:08:36 things go belly-up I can survive long enough to you know switch out and get
01:08:41 back to a normal job and survive on that and then I'll you know that that's what
01:08:45 I'll do let me ask you this would you consider yourself to be that you want
01:08:50 to be a YouTube creator or like an internet creator would you be fine
01:08:55 moving to different platforms or is this platform specifically something that
01:08:58 you are invested in you want to become a video content creator on YouTube I have
01:09:04 found the most joy specifically making video content and so I would like to
01:09:10 stay in that that medium it's kind of my field of expertise but I feel no
01:09:14 particular allegiance to YouTube itself it's just that YouTube does create a
01:09:18 specific kind of ecosystem that you know like my kind of content does fairly
01:09:23 well on and I hope to you know expand and keep trying it so I wouldn't say I'm
01:09:28 inherently like I like if Vimeo took over I wouldn't really care I just keep
01:09:32 doing what I'm doing and just hope that you know people are still able to find
01:09:36 my shit and I can spread it around so you know hopefully that answers the
01:09:40 question yeah okay and this really is a scary episode I'm thinking of my future
01:09:44 now yeah what a dude what am I doing it's like I got a cool like I got a cool
01:09:50 comic and that'll be that and I like I have patreon people who like that and
01:09:55 that's nice and the progress news podcast yeah hippo beyond that I don't
01:10:01 really have anything hippo I think you have a way brighter future ahead of you
01:10:05 than you may industry kind of connections and career you're working on well
01:10:09 there's that yes I mean I'm pretty good at that so I'm sure that I will continue
01:10:13 to have work in the field of writing hippo whether or not you want to do it I
01:10:18 just want to say how like unbelievably aesthetic and like proud of you and like
01:10:24 just how giddy it makes me you just giving us even cursory information about
01:10:30 the industry job that you're working in I think it's so cool it's such it's so
01:10:36 romantic it's just everything that I would want to be in my life it is

01:14:23 each month so you are you are personally financing a trip to the UK
01:14:29 specifically to see hippo um yes for the most part well specific to see London
01:14:37 and stuff dude hippo I'm gonna drag you to so much gay historical stuff you're
01:14:41 not even gonna you're gonna hate you're gonna know yeah much she's gonna

01:14:54 London yeah this is where James Cromwell pissed his pants I just want to
01:15:00 lick it right up yeah well that's all very good episode no now on to onto the
01:15:11 topic at hand Halloween yeah yeah I have I have some scary joke from last time
01:15:21 where I breathe we briefly had a little spat a little fight about like Jack
01:15:25 O'Lanterns shaved or cut right right I've solidified my my problems with
01:15:32 shaved Jack O'Lanterns good okay they are they are technically impressive but
01:15:36 more often than not they are just a copy of a photograph or a piece of other
01:15:42 yeah draw that's true that's true that's strike one strike two is that they're so
01:15:48 often not Halloween themed like if it was a spooky skull etched into a pumpkin
01:15:54 then it'll be like oh cool you know Halloween themed it's a spooky scary
01:15:57 month you put spooky scary things on pumpkins pumpkins themselves are not
01:16:00 spooky if you draw a tiger on they are festive the pumpkin aspect I suppose the
01:16:08 pumpkin is like a timely of the year but like it's not spooky you got to make it
01:16:12 spooky that's the whole point is like the tree during Christmas but you have
01:16:16 to decorate it's it's it's a bunch of pumpkins on your Christmas tree it's
01:16:20 gonna be like what the fog like like if you like shave like a photograph of a
01:16:27 tiger or like a legend of Zelda image skyward sword or whatever the fucking
01:16:33 breath the wild yeah but like oh I'm a epic gamer you put that dude on a pumpkin
01:16:41 the equivalent is to like decorate your Christmas tree with like legend of Zelda
01:16:45 gamer Mario I hate that though it makes me sad dude that'd be so fucking or even
01:16:56 funnier just to have a tiger themed Christmas just have to brief aside
01:17:04 brief aside when I worked at Astor Camp there was a slightly older guy working
01:17:10 there and that I say slightly older he was like in his 30 he was slightly older
01:17:13 than me okay and he it like had used to be a teacher whatever but he had changed
01:17:17 jobs but that's not the point the point is that like you know we we had like a
01:17:21 pool area there was like a lifeguard zone so you know we there was a locker
01:17:26 room and we were changing in there one time and he can't behind you and start
01:17:30 touching things he shouldn't do that's not right and he was like I learned this
01:17:34 in the public school he had he had two tattoos on his back one of them was on
01:17:44 his shoulder blade and it was a small kind of crude profile drawing of a tiger
01:17:50 and the other was like a bigger sort of maybe like maybe six or eight inches it
01:17:55 was kind of like a big thing of like like it was a like a tiger's face and claw
01:18:00 like tearing a hole you know what I mean yeah I hate those so stupid those
01:18:06 are reprehensible yeah he was it was a tiger to and I was like why do you have
01:18:10 these two tiger tattoos and he was just like I just really like tigers he had
01:18:17 gotten the smaller one when he was like a teenager and then later on he had like
01:18:21 treated himself to like the bigger like superior like really cool one or
01:18:25 whatever treated himself wait what he just treated himself like that's like
01:18:32 his little oh no cake for me tonight I'll just get this big man he was like
01:18:38 when he turned 30 or something or some milestone he was like you know what it's
01:18:40 time for me to get a new tiger tattoo to upgrade can you imagine what you're gonna
01:18:44 get it for what's he gonna get at 40 that's gonna be at 40 he's gonna get a
01:18:50 tuger which is a two-headed tiger oh god that's anyway what I don't even
01:19:01 remember what story did I interrupt with that so wait wait wait wait at three
01:19:05 headed tiger would be a trigger that that that that that that that that that that
01:19:11 that that be a trigon yeah I don't know what we were oh I just like the pumpkins
01:19:16 and stuff yeah you guys like those those pictures of my mom's pumpkins from last
01:19:19 week oh let me let me see let me see I'm talking to the audience because they
01:19:22 saw it but they were cool they were cool um I want I want I want anime themed
01:19:29 pumpkins this year as I always do maybe like a maybe like soul eater that's I
01:19:34 can keep it relevant I can do it it's a good show for Halloween boys um hey um so
01:19:42 I was talking to a Kazi actually about Halloween and she somewhat convinced me
01:19:48 about Halloween and her argument was pretty good she was like she said it's
01:19:53 a hot because you know I've said that I don't care for Halloween very much but
01:19:57 she said like Ben Halloween is a holiday where you don't have to do any like dumb
01:20:02 family shit it's just about like hanging out with your friends and having it's
01:20:07 just about having fun and nothing else and I was like well that's uh huh what as
01:20:12 an adult I suppose that's true and I was like you know that's fair that is good
01:20:16 about it and I do like that but it's not the only holiday like that like I would
01:20:22 say that St. Patrick's Day is pretty much the same like you don't digi likes
01:20:26 New Year's cuz New Year's is kind of like that yeah I don't really I don't
01:20:30 really like any of the specific like details that come with Halloween I don't
01:20:36 like spooky shit I don't like horror movies I don't I don't love these the
01:20:41 Halloween aesthetic it's fine I don't watch the extra I don't hate the
01:20:44 like I don't love it either and watch the exorcist you will you will love it I
01:20:48 think you will love it legitimately it's like not scary and it's all Christ II
01:20:52 and shit wait really your aesthetic yeah huh it's really good I watched it
01:20:57 last night and I love okay all right you would enjoy it very much it's like a
01:21:01 horror movie that there's no jump scares it just is occasionally there's creepy
01:21:05 shit and there is some absolutely disgusting moments but they're good and
01:21:08 I like them and most importantly is that there's a there's a sensation that this
01:21:13 movie is from the 70s and they throw out like fuck and cunt and in tasteful
01:21:20 ways that to us are totally tame but to those people it's like the actual words
01:21:24 of the devil and I love that aesthetic it feels great it's awesome it's the one
01:21:29 with the spinning head girl that's the one yeah it sucks cocks and hell yeah
01:21:34 yeah I should watch The Shining I've never seen The Shining the Shining is my
01:21:37 literal favorite scary movie it is absolutely ball dropping terrifying
01:21:43 wait I'm a zoomer right yeah you are okay as a zoomer as a proud zoomer who is
01:21:49 proud of my heritage I cannot wait for your shitty old people movies to fucking
01:21:55 die and for creepyposses to take over as the rightful Halloween material the
01:22:01 true creepypasta munchie munchie well when he's old crack open like like a
01:22:06 coconut water like zero yeah whatever he'll sip it gingerly at age 35 and
01:22:12 say crack open Jane activity 10 now there was a movie I can't fucking wait for
01:22:21 like and like a real movie of a creepypasta where a guy buys an n64 game
01:22:27 and there's something wrong with it okay because because nostalgia nostalgia
01:22:31 like plundering dictates that somebody will think that's a good idea Nate the
01:22:36 paranormal activity thing like yeah you what are we on what paranormal
01:22:40 activity or maybe or something okay well how likely do you think it is
01:22:43 because people do this for fast and furious and maybe it's true I don't
01:22:47 know because I haven't seen them but what if like five or six fat of paranormal
01:22:51 activities from now zoomers on YouTube are making the case like here's the case
01:22:56 for paranormal activity and how after number 10 they became a like metatextual
01:23:01 commentary on their own John we'll achieve the and achieve the pinnacle of
01:23:05 what hard the horror genre is capable of that will definitely happen I mean
01:23:09 that's not even that unlikely to happen because after a while you're almost more
01:23:13 likely to try something different and like do okay then just do the same thing
01:23:17 over and over by the way there there have been six official ones and there's
01:23:22 one unofficial film called a paranormal activity to Tokyo night one of my
01:23:32 you mean Tokyo night with the K right unfortunately not one of my favorite
01:23:39 experiences of being alive like one of the best times I like like like like
01:23:45 intervals of time that I've ever breathed in my entire life was I went to
01:23:50 see the slender man movie recently in theaters with my friend Kyle my friend
01:23:55 and as all diehard diehard bobble horn its fans it was so good to see slender
01:24:02 man and just know that life will never be the same and that I shouldn't feel
01:24:07 myself really upon leaving the theater it was great and okay okay aside from that
01:24:11 and something the legendary experience of slingy scene slender man completely
01:24:15 messed misrepresented and interpreted and literally they just saw the fucking
01:24:20 character designs like I'm gonna make a movie about this aside from all that
01:24:23 for the next fucking like hour and a half it was just one after another it was
01:24:28 us making a joke that there would be a creepy pasta cinema universe and it was
01:24:33 us coming up with after-credits scenes for different creepy pasta so it's like
01:24:36 the main characters to drive the slender man movie she would walk into a bar all
01:24:38 wistfully and like there would be no music and she would go over a guy with a
01:24:42 hood over his head and she'd be like I hear you're good at killing and then
01:24:48 and then he would turn slightly and he would say well I am Jeff the killer and
01:24:53 then the credits would roll there was a fucking Freddy versus Jason movie so
01:25:03 it's inevitable there's inevitably a fucking slender man versus that black
01:25:07 Pokemon cartridge the girl gets on playing like I'm so glad to be rid of
01:25:14 slender man I'm so ready to have that chapter my life be over oh time to get
01:25:18 on a vacation hmm that that or like kind of have a vacation goes to Orlando
01:25:25 Florida you know I like Disney World but what's this abandoned river country hmm
01:25:32 I sure hope I don't get abandoned by Disney credits roll
01:25:39 I don't know what that one is actually I watched I watched this as Fuki sort of
01:25:46 kind of anime like that's the one did you like recommended to me forever ago
01:25:50 angels of death I think yeah I finally finished watching it and like I kind of
01:25:56 liked it at the beginning I really like it gave me sort of a bit of a dangin
01:25:59 rope I feels but then I hated it by the end it fuck did you your predictions are
01:26:04 all shit guess you guys should watch you guys should watch Ultimate Survivor
01:26:10 Kaiji because it's the scariest of all because what it says about capitalism in
01:26:14 our financial system hey Ben we're watching as cry it for Jimmy Bacchus
01:26:18 soon oh you want to do that on Tuesday uh to hang on wait the bonus PCP is

01:26:44 next Chibi Bacchus it'll come out after much it'd be recorded it might not be
01:26:48 released yet but we'll I don't care I don't think it's like a spoiler I think
01:26:52 we said that on the last episode anyway I think we announce the next I don't think
01:26:55 on earth gives a shit about s cry yeah except me except I said yeah you and me
01:27:01 Nate you and me I remember yeah I already disperposed to hate it because
01:27:04 it's called s cried and there's no way it has the worst name of any really bad
01:27:09 name it doesn't I like I haven't read the mind I and I thought and I thought the
01:27:15 procrastinators was a bad name for a whole new level a major major
01:27:21 mention zombie land saga relevant to to current Halloween anime what do you
01:27:28 think mage I like it I really liked it I mean I never liked idle enemies but I
01:27:34 really love this one looks legitimately good kind of it also has me in it for
01:27:39 those who aren't aware there's a big meme literally means in this anime and I
01:27:47 guess you meant IDOL but I was thinking like idle anime is like an idle game
01:27:50 like one that you just let run in the background yeah yeah you don't even have
01:27:54 to listen to it or watch they're gonna make the cookie clicker anime that's what
01:27:57 I want you or teal listen or teal license cookie clicker right now oh my god
01:28:06 I'm playing cookie clicker right now I forgot there's a legit are you really is
01:28:10 that true yeah I started up today no reason I had cookie clicker open for a
01:28:15 couple of weeks there like maybe as of a month ago I it was just open on my
01:28:19 desktop for weeks and weeks I had a bunch of add-ons that basically played the
01:28:22 game for me right pretty much the only thing I had to do was the gardening
01:28:26 minigame I've never played that I don't know what the fuck that is yeah it's
01:28:30 it's one of the later additions there is you can you you have well you have to
01:28:35 grow sugar lumps and you spend your sugar lumps to upgrade your farms and
01:28:38 once you spend them on your farms you have plots of dirt and you have to you
01:28:42 have to like find seeds and plant seeds and hope they cross pollinate into new
01:28:47 seeds in order to get more seeds in order to get more sugar lumps in order to
01:28:51 grow more cookies you see because it all comes back to the cookie cookie clicker
01:28:55 is a great game and it is it is on a on ironically no lean it is a great game and
01:29:00 the lore is honestly pretty damn good I could honestly see some kind of like
01:29:04 lore product being made based off of cookie clicker it is fucking great on the
01:29:08 on the one hand it's like I get it it's a elder tar the grandma's but on the
01:29:14 other hand it's like fucking sick dude like fucking yes I love it yeah I don't
01:29:21 know perhaps a little thin but whatever I still like it I don't know I do love it
01:29:25 it's it's it's it's it's the effort was just the way that he boldly that he boldly
01:29:33 filled his uh his fucking idle his idle clicker game with this this like huge
01:29:39 he vast array of like dumb cliches this like it has this big fucking weird yeah like story
01:29:46 going on it's sort of in the background uh and it just fucking spirals uh I love love cookie
01:29:53 clicker man guys I love thinking about it I love that it exists I should probably do a youtube
01:29:59 analysis video of it do not steal that from me I that's that's the best idea I've ever had um yeah
01:30:06 we uh uh we we gotta wrap this up guys the pokemon event is only two more hours and I
01:30:12 have to get out there oh my god yeah this is a juicy ass episode that I'm loving but I think we
01:30:18 should just yeah we've been going an hour and a half I just want to say that I had a topic
01:30:23 and it was like I like I went on a trip to Denver recently not like a fun trip to idly but like a
01:30:28 like oh it's like a family like okay I'm sure yeah yeah I have come uh I have a lot to say
01:30:33 about that but I wish I had to do that next time on the pro yeah that's how it goes sometimes I mean
01:30:39 I want to hear about it only an hour well well I guess we have questions we yeah we got quite
01:30:44 that'll take a half an hour probably oh oh have we decided to not do text questions are we doing
01:30:48 text questions or we have weeded out I am adamantly anti text questions that yeah that's
01:30:54 where we're that's where we're at right now yeah I haven't heard a good argument to really bring
01:30:57 him back so uh yep yeah that's okay cool all right well uh let's let's get right the fuck into it
01:31:03 um here we go people uh uh uh uh by the way I want to hear some voicemails about the huge
01:31:08 cataclysm earth shattering event that is the max revival of the pcp guy so uh you know let let us
01:31:14 know oh god he's still there he's oh my god he's still alive pcp guy what do you think about me
01:31:20 going to college I never I can't hear you piece piece wow he just speaks and all pcp guy does is
01:31:31 just speak in swarms of flies he he he he talks like the adults in Charlie Brown yeah yeah he's
01:31:38 procrastinating on forming actual words with his sounds you know whenever he opens his mouth to like
01:31:44 like have air exit his lungs he just has flies and said they just swarm they're like lotus is they
01:31:49 just he's an avatar of procrastination yeah yeah uh all right let's let's get our first one he's a good
01:31:56 boy in a word indeed here's our first one we got 12 I prepared 12 this time a little bit more but
01:32:02 whatever uh first one like final fantasy 12 oh my god my favorite game not a bad here we go AFY
01:32:10 and why pony uh I wish we were only dealing with a ladder is just and why wait I want to
01:32:16 talk about wait before we go on I want to talk remember the remember the me too video yeah of
01:32:21 course by who okay I was talking about the other day wait really don't say it don't say who it is
01:32:26 because last time oh yes yep yep yep okay yeah but okay I went back and listened to it again
01:32:32 because something about it creeped me out right I found I found the video I think I know exactly
01:32:37 and I went back and I yeah yeah okay it is halloween I'm spooked the thing okay so ostensibly the
01:32:45 video is about how what she was quote unquote abused or harassed by this guy she tells the story
01:32:49 and it's not what happened like just that is just not the story that she tells even though she claims
01:32:54 that it is yeah um but there's there's more right because like the setup to the story like what she
01:33:01 says happened is that she got on a call with you know the the the the villain the supposed
01:33:07 villain of the story um and she quote showed off for it right oh no but you go back and you listen
01:33:13 to the context that sets up this and what she says is that she was in a call with with an y pony
01:33:22 right and um it was his birthday it was his birthday yeah it was a birthday call for an y pony
01:33:28 and she says this with like a little giggle she's like tee he you know yeah you know how it is guys
01:33:31 she says we were on a call and me and the girl me and the other girls were giggle showing off yeah
01:33:38 what does that mean okay what kind of a fucking birthday is this so all these bronies get together
01:33:44 and have their girlfriends show their tits to yeah all right they might have done it to to the
01:33:49 birthday they might all just be sluts that's definitely possible I don't think it's okay I think
01:33:54 it's probably likely for bronies just to think that that's okay to do it's is that I mean yeah I
01:34:00 I listened to this I listened to this and it was like I was gobsmacked right like I went on a long
01:34:05 walk and like a sad song played like I looked out a window into the rainy night and I just thought
01:34:09 about my life and I was like it was who's who's crazy someone's crazy here and I and I and I think
01:34:15 maybe it's me maybe maybe I'm some kind of weird puritanical weirdo to like hear this story and
01:34:21 be creeped out by it like maybe I need to check my privilege and fucking realize that I live in 2018
01:34:27 and everybody's trans and poly now and there are no and they're and God is dead and there is no
01:34:32 objective morality and nothing is not true and nothing is good no no no no no I was I was jealous
01:34:37 I wanted to be a and wise birthday on my birthday this is why I hate having left the fandom you
01:34:44 guys I could get all that bronies we gotta go back we have to go back there's so many no they're doing
01:34:48 over there finally a good reason to go back there's so many girlfriends in that community and as you
01:34:52 know dating a bronie like the contract of dating one of these bronies that all on on your on your
01:34:56 boyfriend's friend's birthday you gotta fucking you gotta fucking show up you gotta fucking show
01:35:01 up and show out like the piece of meat that you are that's you will you sign the contract your
01:35:05 communism it's pure everyone gets a piece of everyone yeah you introduce yourself into a big
01:35:11 communal marriage of everyone with everyone and I mean I mean yeah yeah effectively like like
01:35:16 if you're dating if you're dating one bronie you're basically dating all yeah which basically means
01:35:21 that that what what this the me too girl did was fine because that was just part of the contract
01:35:26 makes they're all they're all public use I self-identify as a liberal and I would say that
01:35:31 I'm I'm probably liberal on a lot of social things but what I can't ever get my head around
01:35:39 or like appreciate is polyamory and open relationships like I can't do it it's the
01:35:44 one thing where I just am a fuddy duddy about it you know some people I'm sure it like I don't
01:35:51 want to be overly judgmental like I'm sure yeah okay there's some people who tell themselves that
01:35:56 it works when really they don't they'd rather they don't but I'm sure there's probably another
01:36:00 subset of people that like actually are fine yeah I'm sure that it's real it just feel like with
01:36:06 my own personal baggage it feels strange not in an open relationship obviously but you know
01:36:12 having maybe one it feels like what you described Nate is a real thing that is worth looking into
01:36:19 the idea of being an open relationship when you don't want to be in one I think that's
01:36:23 fucking terrifying whoa whoa whoa whoa when you when you don't want to be in one then that's
01:36:28 that's just cheating I'm not some people will they like rationalize to themselves that like I'm
01:36:33 totally okay with this honey that you go and fuck you know down the road yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:36:39 sure um here okay here's the thing here's the thing and I don't know this might be a hot take
01:36:43 we'll see tell me tell me if this is too hot to handle um I think I think okay I think being I think
01:36:52 being poly or whatever is an umbrella term but within that term there's probably like as many
01:36:58 ways to be poly as there are people that do kind of like kind of like being trans or being like
01:37:03 gender like a gender and like here there's trans people but every individual trans person like
01:37:08 they're not all this they're not all doing it the same way right like they don't all see they don't
01:37:12 all see it the same way or do it the same way and it doesn't mean the same thing to everyone at the
01:37:17 very least there's the trans movement that like believes in like I was born female in a male body
01:37:22 like I'm switching now I'm like I'm just just and then there's people who are more like fluid so
01:37:26 you know sure sure like the point is just that I think there's like probably a rainbow there's
01:37:31 probably a rainbow of different situations and attitudes that would all be that would all fall
01:37:36 broadly under the head of being in a quote poly relationship you know there's probably people
01:37:41 in there there's probably people in there who just are who just are like who don't feel you know
01:37:47 there's probably people in there for whom it is like a passion that they're like I like this is
01:37:51 what I want to do I want to I want to fuck and my partner wants to fuck and we like to fuck but
01:37:55 there's probably other people who are like maybe in an unhappy marriage in there but they can't
01:37:59 but they they don't feel they can leave it for whatever reason and so the compromise they have
01:38:03 reached like well let's just say we're poly now and then it's like whatever um you know I mean I
01:38:07 guess that's fair you know and probably there's many others that I I wouldn't I wouldn't like for
01:38:12 example though I wouldn't describe like let's say you got like uh like uh like in house of cards
01:38:16 you had like power politician couple and like they don't get divorced for one of the reasons is
01:38:22 they actually do love each other but they don't get divorced uh because like it'd be bad politically
01:38:26 so like yeah even if those people like let's say they fuck other people I wouldn't call that really
01:38:30 polyamory though you know I guess kind of literally is because okay if they didn't love each other
01:38:36 anymore just kind of a show right well kind of yeah I don't know I don't know I I haven't seen I
01:38:40 haven't seen how's it something that I don't like to talk about for obvious reasons but but I feel
01:38:44 kind of is an important distinction nay I feel very kinship with you I was also a migtau incel
01:38:52 yet you never want to admit that you feel so yeah yeah yeah that way lies madness
01:38:58 yeah I was also like like oh like I had a lot of a tortured history with with small women this
01:39:05 and stuff like that oh and uh and and this is the one thing from that era that I've never been
01:39:11 into shake is that's really weird and I don't and it makes me feel weird just thinking about what
01:39:18 what's the one probably amory no that's not you're not you're not weird for not being down with
01:39:24 with polyamory that's I think that's the vanilla okay okay I know it's the vanilla position but I
01:39:30 am like a cuck so like it would make sense okay I think polyamory is good but like that's the one
01:39:35 thing you're saying it doesn't match your progressive values what does that mean I mean
01:39:40 I mean that I'm like an sjw libtard and it's weird that I'm not down oh I think what you're I mean
01:39:46 you would never stop anyone else it's not that you're not it's not that you're not down with it
01:39:50 it's that you don't want it for yourself yeah yeah yeah you're right I mean I've never stopped anyone
01:39:55 but it just makes me feel uncomfortable when people talk like if a friend of mine okay this is
01:40:00 probably where we agree if a friend of mine came to me and is like hey man like like that's how I
01:40:04 feel whenever there's a black person okay right there you go it's it's like a friend of your
01:40:09 comes I was like hey dude you know hey do you want to talk listen so my girlfriend's been saying that
01:40:14 like she doesn't want to break up with me but like she's polyamorous and I'm like wondering if
01:40:18 like I should do it like maybe I'm polyamorous too dude like what I would tell them to break up right
01:40:22 then yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah 100% uh yeah to all the to all the p the poly fans sorry I guess
01:40:33 look yeah like it's totally fine if you want to do it I am suspicious that you're fooling yourself
01:40:37 if you come into me yeah tell me that you love it but I think there is probably a lot of that
01:40:42 I'm not I think there's not everyone maybe not everyone but I think that there is a lot of that
01:40:47 is my is my impression people really want to be down you know they want to be down do you think the
01:40:52 majority of polyamorous relationships are of Caucasians poly want a cracker oh my god I hate you so much
01:41:04 he fucking got me that's like the most stretch for a pun ever you're stretching cock Asian to be the
01:41:12 cock of a parrot and poly to be a parrot I got it got it that's the most stretch of all there was layers
01:41:19 you know hey oh I'm a pirate I'm a pirate skeleton I have a parrot here the whole time this is not
01:41:25 even a point this is not even a point this is just a fact or a feeling or something I don't know
01:41:31 just fuck I'm gonna throw it out there and see if anyone cares there's a thing that I have like
01:41:36 read about or seen talked about the idea like like there's like real poly people right okay and that
01:41:43 like lifestyles or whatever and then there's like this other thing this like light version this like
01:41:49 this like dipping your toe into it and like thinking like tee he I'm I'm progressive or I'm different
01:41:55 like I'm I'm poly now sure and it's and like the real poly people hate it and it's the like
01:41:59 the girl right like a couple like a guy and a girl couple like getting a getting the quote
01:42:05 unquote unicorn to be their third or whatever and this is like this is like okay specifically I'm
01:42:11 thinking there's a there's a hello not not not uh what's that fucking comic with the comic uh
01:42:17 ojoy sex toy there's an ojoy there's a guest ojoy sex toy that is about like like here's my experience
01:42:24 with polyamory I fucking was best friends with these two people who dated each other and then I
01:42:30 dated them both two and we had sex with each other and blue sure and it's like and now I'm poly
01:42:35 and everything is great and I love my life and people and the response to this was like you are
01:42:40 just you are just a unicorn this is like this is like some fake trans shit you've been like coerced
01:42:46 into a threesome by like these two people like they've this is like this is bullshit this is
01:42:51 this is the bullshit version of our lifestyle this is like yeah yeah yeah this is this is just
01:42:56 some garbage that's so weird that's like bizarre and I don't understand the distinction I think I
01:43:04 think what it is is that I think in this situation I think this is a pretty common like a relatively
01:43:10 common way to be you know poly or whatever this is a relatively common way to do it but it's like
01:43:15 I think that the power balance is off I think the power balance is that there is two like this person
01:43:20 is writing like now I'm now I'm you know I'm I've found my two soulmates you know I'm in love with
01:43:26 my two best friends haha and and they're in love with each other but like but really there's the
01:43:32 couple and the other one and she's like even if she likes to tell herself other I think I think
01:43:37 that generally the way the way that the reason this is looked at as negative and this is not
01:43:41 seen as great is that the way this usually plays out is that there is the couple and the other and
01:43:46 this person might see herself as a part of this but really she's the other one okay and she's
01:43:50 and she's less that's kind of a compassionate thing like they kind of want this person to not
01:43:55 like trick themselves don't get her heartbroken or whatever like this is this is kind of maybe
01:43:59 subtly manipulative or emotionally abusive and or deceptive or something you know I don't know
01:44:06 people don't like that hard the hardcore lifers they read they read a story like this and they roll
01:44:10 their eyes and they go oh another fucking unicorn who gives a shit that's how I feel about people
01:44:16 who say they're gay wait no uh not me just kidding uh sorry we gotta move on quick

01:45:33 about it yay go ahead makes it we did it we did it we got it uh hey we got the main hot take now I'm
01:45:41 happy okay well good first voicemail is from from from african afy this guy is this guy I know
01:45:48 and he actually had his channel deleted with like 75 000 subs recently for uh well he so he made these
01:45:55 meme videos about um there was an elf there was like an elf character who was named stated to be 14
01:46:02 years old afy what what his name was afy oh yeah afy or afykun it's anime for you I think it's his
01:46:11 channel something like that so he got his channel like instantly removed zero strikes just gone uh
01:46:17 after really releasing this video about an elf character and the point of the video is that the
01:46:22 character is stated to be 14 but then he he humorously looks up how like elf years to human
01:46:28 years and she's actually like 140 or something and then he has a bunch of crabs dance and it's
01:46:33 funny that is the joke also she has huge tits and they're portrayed prominently in the anime so you
01:46:40 know whatever okay um uh uh he eventually got his channel back just congrats afy glad to hear it good
01:46:46 good job good job and uh let's let's hear what he asked for us today he's a great editor by the way
01:46:51 this guy's real good at shit so uh well let's see if he's got a good question for us go

01:47:52 undercover meme mission you'll snitch me to fucking you oh fuck

01:48:21 everypony well i hope that works for you afi uh wish you're best of luck i i i i wonder about
01:48:26 like he was using the the neon genesis a vangillian opening theme yeah like if we get content id for
01:48:32 that we're gonna have to mute him and then and then we get our channel then and it's a virus it's
01:48:37 it's an infection that spreads that is definitely possible you might be muted you might be muted
01:48:41 guy yeah we might have to mute you if that gets fucked up uh we'll see what we can do we'll see
01:48:45 what we can do um all right well good uh we gave him his thing all right next up another regular
01:48:51 one spar let's see what one spar has for us today the boy go he's not wolf hey pcp it's me and
01:48:57 got no gimmick this time just a basic hypothetical question for you which temporary video game do
01:49:02 you think could benefit most from a pcp themed mod pack like uh one good one that i can think of
01:49:08 would be a grand theft auto five story mod where you replace the three main characters with munchie
01:49:13 digi and nate and then you know you can have like some uh some podcast voice clips thrown in their
01:49:18 forum for comedic effect i think that would be great uh we'll be some other good ones uh you guys
01:49:23 do the work for me undertale uh uh uh uh we talked about imagine imagine undertale bonus bosses
01:49:33 like like bonus like like we're like someone makes us okay okay i was thinking about this
01:49:38 extensively earlier i don't know why ben and this is real this is true i was imagining you
01:49:42 was an undertale boss but it wouldn't be like you were drawn it would be like it's an fmv video
01:49:47 of you just like maximum black and photoshop and would just be a voice clip of you like pointing
01:49:52 the camera and saying stop that over and over again when you got hit and for some reason i thought
01:49:56 about this like for like 30 minutes i was just thinking about like yeah like how can i program this
01:50:03 like a little fmv like like um threshold like black and white only yeah and there would be and
01:50:08 since you couldn't get a perfect like wall in the background there would be a little bit of pixels
01:50:12 that wouldn't be able to render right and so it would be like there's like an oar of white around
01:50:16 yeah we should build that in minecraft as well uh minecraft it's not it's not a very new game at
01:50:22 this point but uh what about binding of isaac what if we there was a patch for binding of isaac
01:50:26 we're like with each of us and we can talk about that yeah yeah yeah pcs we gotta get we gotta get
01:50:32 forward and back home i want i want a mod of smash a nate would be cat and falcon i would be getting
01:50:39 a door sure uh then would be like some like like projectile character i don't know who though
01:50:47 greninja i don't know pit i hope so i hope i'd be greninja um i don't know hippo would be like
01:50:55 villager yeah he would be he would be rosalina and the luma would be ah oh that's a good one
01:51:02 that's a good one uh i'll be floating around for some reason we see who else have we got
01:51:07 that i can't think of any other characters yeah that's about i think that's about it for the roster
01:51:13 mutu uh once you would be mutu i'd play mutu i love mutu he would just be blasting psychic
01:51:19 energies i would be constantly transferring myself over nowhere again i could i could be
01:51:24 be annetta am i am i on the right game yeah yeah it's not me annetta's in there now okay she
01:51:30 has glasses i have glasses and that's all right oh yeah is there any other with glasses i don't
01:51:38 think there is i can't think of any uh yeah no i don't know only one representation for glasses
01:51:44 that's very discriminatory how embarrassing there might be more i can't more more i would just
01:51:48 wait wait i would just be pokemon trainer and i would just be oh wait wait do they is that even
01:51:52 a thing anymore uh yes yeah it's it is i would just be pokemon trainer and you could just change
01:51:58 my sprite in the background and everything else would be exactly the same yeah that's
01:52:02 all the pokemon have like lace chokers and like emo goth stuff on yeah i like christ tattoos
01:52:09 i they're all malnourished and they're covered i would fucking love um a tf2 oh my god model of
01:52:18 pcp of us and and then and then a special one of munchie going like um you know christ consciousness
01:52:25 activated like a sx oh my god yes oh my god make me a sacks and hail boss that would be
01:52:31 the best thing to ever happen in the ground you fucking nigga is the thing you say over and over
01:52:35 again yeah sacks and hail sacks and hail is a game mode where it's like one person is super
01:52:39 overpowered and you have to in the entire team has to take them down and really hard because you can
01:52:42 get one shot activated christ people have like made mods for like pinky pie being yeah yeah
01:52:48 running around oh dude people have made so many fucking models for like the pyro to have huge tits
01:52:54 and and and for all the ponies to be different uh classes dude okay okay here's the seals the fate
01:53:00 of this nine classes nine pcp members do the math who's who i think one oh isn't our ninth
01:53:07 wait no that you're right yeah you're right um um question uh i'm sniper how many i'm a sniper
01:53:14 how many dragons are there in skyrim have you seen the randy set or the uh the macho man
01:53:19 mod for the dragons in skyrim no i want to be pyro it just turns all the dragons into macho man
01:53:24 randy savage but like you know i was about to say skyrim dragon yeah yeah just make each of us
01:53:31 give me different dragons the dragons being thomas the tank engine and then they just fly around
01:53:35 but but i don't i don't know if there are i don't know how many dragons are in skyrim i'm assuming
01:53:39 more than nine probably yeah the very first dragon mod of skyrim i saw was a giant fluttershot
01:53:46 huh uh excellent first row yeah all right this question is getting burned into the ground let's
01:53:51 move on uh okay next question this is from enraged but chilling chocolate our old boy chilling
01:53:57 huh hey munchy hey hippo i i really love your content i really love chibi bakas is what i would
01:54:05 be saying if you i don't just commit a grave crime against all of the anime fandom you see
01:54:12 here i'm getting my papers out i i'm here to litigate you when did you brony mlp himself
01:54:18 challenged you to the most important thing anime rap cipher 2018 oh we're supposed to follow up on
01:54:25 that you're supposed to give us a sick raps but you didn't okay he's right and so it's time it's
01:54:32 time for you to face your proper punishment all right so munchy here's what's gonna happen
01:54:38 that's a good idea if you don't if if within a week of this pcp episode coming out he's making it
01:54:45 up there is no rap i will be forced i will absolutely have to make an account called at the
01:54:52 real munchy enlist as a killer and vaguely insult rowdy's hypocrite i can't do anything
01:55:01 unrelated to rfck but when munchies credibility is destroyed like this you're gonna be
01:55:07 missing out on those sweet sweet chibi baka add dollars you know you're right
01:55:12 we'll be down to mere sense do it you have one week hippo give me a beat integrity is everything
01:55:21 oh well right now right now okay i'll lay down a beat okay then you do it no no you're not part
01:55:29 chibi box fucking idiot hippo okay so i don't have to rap cool correct
01:55:36 yo i watch anime sure it may be gay but i'll do it every day hey listen i need my antidepressants
01:55:44 i need my well butrin sure i might be depressed but if you mess with me i'll be shooting and i'll
01:55:50 knock you down call me isik newton because of gravity and the force that i will use to push
01:55:55 you down to the fucking ground and kill you boom boom boom boom boom yeah anime raps yeah there you
01:56:04 go you did it now we can use the n word box it did the trick just just increase the gain massively
01:56:12 and make it really fast okay uh just speed it up chipmunk style there it is
01:56:18 i'll it lasts like three seconds it was long enough all right here we go next one's from help
01:56:26 help we're sending in a message all right where's your brother kelp i have this friend
01:56:32 she's basically the definition of a pcp fan she's bi she watches anime she draws uh and knows about
01:56:42 internet shit but introduce me the only thing that's not right is that she doesn't work in pcp
01:56:52 how do i convince her to watch the pcp this is a good question well okay okay did she not like the
01:56:59 pcp she does not know about it he says that she doesn't watch we also like an i okay and there
01:57:05 there are people who draw in the pcp really relate really yeah yeah this is actually a pretty good
01:57:10 question because there might be people out there who love us and love our stuff and want to introduce
01:57:15 us to other people but don't know how i feel like this might be fairly common i agree like a fairly
01:57:20 common problem uh okay just throwing this out there let me know what you think i mean i think you
01:57:25 should the way to introduce the pcp would probably be through one of the not one of the other things
01:57:31 one of us have done right like show them like i don't know show them like uh fucking you know
01:57:37 best uh best anime ever take a good top of gurnlog and if that's their jam or if that's their jam
01:57:42 or show them you know the ben's ben ben's ain't nuzlocke conquest if that's if that's what they're
01:57:47 into or you know or or punk or something or just or like the ghibli curse that's quite yeah yeah yeah
01:57:52 or the ghibli cast you know or maybe some of the radcon stuff any of the lectures the point of
01:57:57 the entry oh yeah the lecture they need an entry point the p the pcp is not an entry point the pcp
01:58:02 is the end point the pcp is the end of all things once you're you want you you've only you only
01:58:08 arrive here once you've circled the drain and finally been pulled down he's right uh so you
01:58:13 have to start the process you have to get that penny wobbling as it spins on that uh you know
01:58:18 tourist thing where you put a penny in and it goes around the circle many many times you got to get
01:58:21 that penny put in there before it goes down there so find some some video yeah don't think about like
01:58:27 uh i need them listening to the pcp right now you've got to you've got to hook them
01:58:30 so start with a video of any of the pcp related stuff that they'd be into that you think hook them
01:58:35 with something by one of us yeah that is their thing and you think they would like like what
01:58:40 what did you what did you like about from us that got you into maybe show them that i don't know
01:58:44 yeah good idea yeah that's a good question that now that that's actually useful uh yeah good excellent
01:58:51 okay and everyone should do that everyone should be thinking all the time about how to get all
01:58:55 their friends into the pcp and us mostly me uh all right here we go next one this is from
01:59:02 furniture is a scam by tar buck transom is the full name okay go furniture is a scam and i don't
01:59:11 mean that in the ben saint way where your home decor should be chinese takeout cartons you've
01:59:14 scavenged from other people's trash think back to the sturdiest comfiest couch you've ever had
01:59:20 on the inside that was made of the cheapest garbage wood they can find and then badly
01:59:24 stapled together and i mean that is literally as possible that shelving unit against your wall
01:59:28 right now it's made of particle board which if you didn't know is literally just sawdust and glue
01:59:32 i literally have a particle board so here you say well look at the underside it's particle board
01:59:37 with a wood textured sticker on it it's all fake and flimsy and way too expensive a few
01:59:43 episodes back you were talking about wanting to make stuff with your hands well i'm a real crafty
01:59:46 boy and i made two six foot tall bookcases for my games a set of shelves for my consoles and a
01:59:51 little end table and it was all for 15 bucks i'm a rat 35 dollars if you include the cost of the
01:59:55 tools which are reusable and all of it was solid wood and sturdy as fuck and will last for a century
02:00:00 minimum because it's fucking immortal it's probably true if you any of you procrastinators out there
02:00:05 and only the procrastinators fuck the rest of you want to learn to be crafty like me hit me up on
02:00:10 twitter i'm fast talking megastar an indestructible super god tar buck transom spelling is in the
02:00:14 title i like him too i'm i'm really i like this guy yeah wait no was that an ad uh did we
02:00:23 kind of we just use as a vessel for advertising no no no i don't think it was an ad it was that
02:00:28 just just for us he did just simply say he doesn't want to hear from anyone except us
02:00:34 okay acceptable it could be deceptive but yeah i don't know i trust this man with my life i have
02:00:40 i literally have a piece of shit particle board shelf right over here um my shit is on it it is
02:00:47 not it does not have a wood panel sticker on it is painted white interesting thing about it i'm
02:00:52 looking at it and there is appears to be a whiteout or some kind of like like cover up paint
02:00:58 painted over but if i look at it at the right angle in the right light i can kind of see what
02:01:03 this whiteout is covering and it seems to say it says i love came possible a lot blade or blade
02:01:12 or blame i love some i love lake so much with a heart i'm glad that was painted over that's
02:01:20 quite a it was painted over with something but the the the remnants are still there fascinating
02:01:26 it's a metaphor for life uh well that's cool i hope those two have a happy future together
02:01:31 doubt it otherwise it would have been would have been one to wish them a happy wedding
02:01:36 don't do it don't waste your ones people okay guys the first pcp fan to get married is the first
02:01:43 pcp fan to get married get on it do it do it now yeah that's true that's quite a distinction uh uh did
02:01:49 i mention on my live stream i think it was it was it was reverse spectrum i think oh yes dude he uh uh

02:02:25 response let's get to it boom you know what annoys me people who talk about ketosis but they also
02:02:33 don't work out and they don't actually take care of nutrients in the body yeah these these people
02:02:39 are just using the whole ketosis meme as just an excuse for not buying food because they're poor
02:02:46 also this goes out to mr bones i think you got the wrong podcast the best debate in the universe
02:02:51 is to block down i forget what that end part is about the best debate in the universe oh yeah
02:02:57 bone said something to him last time i think i think he's a bitch or something i don't remember
02:03:02 i don't remember mr bones his message i'm sure it was wonderful
02:03:06 the time is spreading amongst the people you know is a fucking hope that ketosis is
02:03:11 a kind of a meme it is kind of a meme yeah yeah okay well great i should i should work i should
02:03:16 work out more but that's a separate issue that's a separate that's a separate
02:03:21 failing of mine i like his idea that people people just say they're in ketosis when really they're
02:03:26 just too lazy to buy food that's their real problem you know food is more expensive because
02:03:31 i'm on keto i spend more on food because i buy like brazil nuts and like meat and poison yourself
02:03:36 i can't just i can't get by on ramen whatever yeah well fair enough all right next one here we go

02:04:54 result on google images when you search for worst guy ever is tom grasping at straws and some kind of
02:04:59 astroturfing campaign to get as much attention as he's human he can without looking like a
02:05:04 fucking idiot what the fuck was that it's like auto tuned roba why did he auto tune this random
02:05:13 to the to the point where we couldn't understand him yeah well he was just saying that like tom's
02:05:17 like he he is like editing google search results so that he is the top result on worst guy ever
02:05:23 as some sort of campaign for attention or something um why would anyone do that uh
02:05:31 he is a bizarre coincidence he must not believe that it's genuine i i guess that's what he's saying
02:05:35 i guess that's what he says he's he's he's this is a conspiracy theory worst guy ever it's the
02:05:41 funny that comes up tom that is bizarre um okay let's let's get to our next one small world small

02:06:49 from tri zeno 10 apparently okay i might have spelled that wrong whatever it's close enough
02:06:56 huge fan and i just wanted to point out that ben saint is the personification of the doomer meme
02:07:02 he is the meme made flesh discuss just i said discussed for a second i've discussed that
02:07:09 ben said just discussed as well um kind of uh what's a doomer what's what is i wasn't on that
02:07:15 episode okay what specifically is a doomer a doomer is uh a type of millennial who is nihilistic
02:07:22 kind of given up on life uh just like smoke cigarettes and doesn't place much value in his
02:07:29 life or plan for his future and is just kind of content to watch the world burn basically and
02:07:34 just hates everything well i mean can you be a happy doomer i'm kind of like that but like i'm
02:07:40 i'm fine with it i'm not i'm not bummed out about any of it that's the thing you don't actually fit
02:07:44 the profile of a doomer in attitude because you don't like beat the world that much all of those
02:07:49 behaviors right i do all of those behaviors right so my attitude is not is not doom it's a yeah a
02:07:56 doomlet bed's kind of a doomlet that's i'm do i'm doomer lights yeah i'm doomer adjacent i mean
02:08:03 yeah you're no one would say that you're a bloomer or anything like me uh uh you know for various
02:08:08 reasons because you're not are you wait what's a bloomer again uh one who wants to secure a future
02:08:12 for the white race oh yeah that yeah i'm not that cool like an like an optimistic uh like
02:08:20 kind of that it's kind of that uh like positive negative uh thing about like nothing means anything
02:08:25 the the bloomers that nothing means anything i can decide my own my own destiny yeah exactly
02:08:31 just somebody i feel like i feel like i embody all the behaviors of a doomer but my attitude is
02:08:37 more like a bloomer yeah i am i'm a more pretty positive person i think and i i share a lot of
02:08:43 the doomer conclusions about i don't i i sure i don't believe in like an objective it's almost as
02:08:48 if labels are stupid yeah it's almost it's almost as if people can't be like broadly slotted into
02:08:55 white categories like haha oh all right well all right all right no sorry there's one more from
02:09:02 the lord of ghosts the lord of ghosts himself has has a message let's let's hear what he's got for us
02:09:07 um sorry i'm behind on the typing there we go go
02:09:16 if a friend with a lord of ghosts has claimed your soul where am i people people is that you
02:09:26 no no no does that is so anyone could anyone understand that in i i i i i i think i did i
02:09:35 understood it hippo the lord of ghosts has claimed your soul and then are you and then he
02:09:40 larped as me saying hippo where are you well okay hang on i think what happened was you were
02:09:45 saying before that you don't have a soul you you jumped the gun then because i think what
02:09:48 just happened is he separated the soul from your body during that call the lord of ghosts
02:09:54 and that was your soul crying out which is now separate from you uh that's my yeah how tedious
