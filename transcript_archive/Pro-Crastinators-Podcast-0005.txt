00:00:00 Hello and welcome to episode 5 of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're back again this week to talk about a new topic.
00:00:07 I'm your host, Guy, the best guy ever, your anime man extraordinaire, talking about all the hypest, kawaii shit that you need to have in your life.
00:00:15 And I'm here with my internet people once again. Let's go down the line. Ben, who are you?
00:00:21 Ben Saint, SaintComics.com. I'm a mangomancer.
00:00:26 Don't forget that Patreon link. That's what the people want to hear about.
00:00:30 No man, I'm playing it close to the chest this week. I'm keeping it cool.
00:00:34 Listen to this guy. Alright, Digi.
00:00:37 I stay hype! I stay hype!
00:00:40 There you go. Jesse Wood.
00:00:42 I'm Endless Jess. I review cartoons every week, but I forgot to this week.
00:00:46 Oh!
00:00:47 Ashy as fuck. Gibb, Hippocrit.
00:00:50 I'm Hippocrit, and I'm taking a shit.
00:00:54 And the Davoo.
00:00:56 I edit Digi Bro videos, or make my own videos. It depends on what gets the most patronage.
00:01:03 There you go. And we're back this week to talk about Hippocrit.
00:01:10 I think this is going to be the best podcast we've ever had, ever recorded ever.
00:01:16 Yes, I think that's crazy.
00:01:19 It might just change the entire podcast landscape, rock the whole industry to its core.
00:01:25 That's right. There's no doubt about it.
00:01:27 Oh, I get it. It's a joke.
00:01:30 That's no joke. You can take that to the bank and make 1.1% interest dividends on that motherfucker.
00:01:38 You thought that was great. Just wait for the next ones.
00:01:41 I don't know how you guys are thinking about doing this, but I think all I've been thinking about in preparation for this was just all the examples of hype
00:01:48 that have ruined my life over the years, with a couple examples of things that have come out relatively okay.
00:01:55 Because in general, and I think we'll probably all agree on this,
00:01:59 hype is the worst thing ever.
00:02:01 It is cancer.
00:02:02 It ruins my life all the time.
00:02:04 I don't like it. I don't like it.
00:02:05 Yeah, it's terrible.
00:02:06 It is.
00:02:07 There are occasional things that we can talk about when things actually live up to the hype,
00:02:12 and when you are hyped for something and it lives up to it, that's great.
00:02:16 But when it actually goes beyond your hype, that's when shit gets absolutely crazy.
00:02:22 And the most recent one that comes to mind for me is Undertale,
00:02:27 because everything I expected with Undertale was achieved at the end of the pacifist run,
00:02:32 and then when you get into the genocide stuff and all the stuff beyond that,
00:02:36 it went shooting way beyond anything I thought it would do.
00:02:39 I have a problem with people who say that Undertale was overhyped,
00:02:45 because it wasn't hyped at all. There was nothing official.
00:02:48 All the hype was word of mouth.
00:02:50 There was the demo, and I was super excited for the demo,
00:02:53 but yeah, everything became word of mouth after the game came out.
00:02:56 I mean, as someone who played the demo and then jumped on the game almost as soon as it came out,
00:03:03 like for me, even I was hyped for it just because I love the demo.
00:03:09 Yeah, me too.
00:03:10 I mean, but now look at the internet.
00:03:13 Now if your friends with anyone on the internet, they've told you you've got to play Undertale,
00:03:18 but don't look up spoilers because it'll blow your mind.
00:03:21 Well, you can say that the fans have overhyped it,
00:03:24 but I mean like when people blame the game for being overhyped,
00:03:27 when there was no marketing behind it whatsoever in the first place.
00:03:30 Right.
00:03:31 It's not like Watch Dogs where the hype was completely generated as a marketing thing beforehand.
00:03:37 There's one very big distinction to make with hype,
00:03:40 and that is a very specific kind of hype, which is pre-release hype,
00:03:44 which is mostly what we're going to talk about that week.
00:03:46 Corporate.
00:03:47 Sure.
00:03:48 Well, we'll talk about both.
00:03:49 Well, I mean, look at something like...
00:03:50 The actual hype that's good is like when you're actually having the thing that hype I love.
00:03:55 I don't know about that all the time because something like...
00:03:57 That kind of hype can be bad too.
00:03:58 Yeah, like a game like Final Fantasy VII or something,
00:04:01 if you want to play that now, there's no way you're going to go into that without bad news.
00:04:06 Everyone's got bad news now.
00:04:07 Let's take a step back.
00:04:08 Let's explain.
00:04:09 I want to explain hype before we get too deep into this.
00:04:12 Okay, good idea.
00:04:13 It's kind of what we do on this podcast.
00:04:14 Where's our Urban Dictionary, Nate?
00:04:16 That was the one that you had one job.
00:04:17 Yeah, I actually did.
00:04:18 I opened it, but the description was lackluster, so I didn't even buy it,
00:04:21 but I'll read it to you right now.
00:04:22 And I'll just do my own...
00:04:23 I'll just define it myself.
00:04:25 So hype basically is when you're getting excited for something.
00:04:29 When something is generating a lot of attention and everyone's looking forward to it,
00:04:34 or in the aftermath of it, people are making it out to be something amazing.
00:04:38 So hype can't...
00:04:41 You can never be hype for something that you've seen.
00:04:44 Hype is something that you either project to other people or receive from other people.
00:04:50 You almost verbatim quoted hype on Urban Dictionary,
00:04:53 which is when someone gets excited about something.
00:04:56 So good job.
00:04:57 But I think hype as an experience, once you've seen something and you think it's great,
00:05:04 you can hype it for other people, but I don't think that counts as you feeling hype.
00:05:10 You're now creating hype.
00:05:11 Hype is what people feel before they see it.
00:05:14 Other people hype something up for you, or you hype something up for other people,
00:05:20 but once you've seen it, you can no longer just be hype for it.
00:05:24 Let me put forward a somewhat counterintuitive notion,
00:05:28 which is that I believe that all hype negatively impacts the experience
00:05:35 and that generally the better you think something's going to be, the worse it actually is,
00:05:41 even if it's good.
00:05:42 There's something to that.
00:05:43 And that if you think something's bad, then it's going to be bad,
00:05:48 then it ends up being better, regardless.
00:05:51 And that hype is kind of like spoilers for overall quality in that if you're told something's good
00:06:00 and that it ends up being good, it's like you've sort of been spoiled on its goodness already
00:06:05 and it feels less significant.
00:06:07 I don't know if I agree with that.
00:06:09 I know what you mean.
00:06:10 I sort of agree there.
00:06:11 I think there's a lot of overlap.
00:06:12 I think that hype serves a purpose in that in order for you to go out of your way to seek out an experience,
00:06:19 you need to have experienced a certain amount of hype for it.
00:06:22 Yeah, that's the thing.
00:06:23 But if you get too much of it, then it's going to, but the hype itself negatively impacts your experience.
00:06:29 I would say that I have had more things ruined for me with hype than by spoilers,
00:06:36 where oftentimes if I hear a spoiler for something I didn't even care about,
00:06:40 it might get me interested because I'm like, whoa, that happens.
00:06:43 That's kind of like, maybe there's a show that I thought looked dumb,
00:06:46 but then I found out that one character dies and I'm like, oh, that's actually kind of cool.
00:06:50 Then I watch it.
00:06:52 But when people hype something for me and they make it out like, oh man, you're going to love this.
00:06:58 My immediate thought going into it is I better love this.
00:07:02 Am I going to love this as much as that guy thinks I'm going to?
00:07:06 Let's find out.
00:07:07 I'm really with Ben on that one.
00:07:09 In my bizarre, puritanical view of spoilers definitely crosses over into hype.
00:07:16 You need that little bit to get you to even play it in the first place,
00:07:19 but I don't even want to know if something is good or bad or when good things happen.
00:07:23 How many times you play in a game next to someone and they're like, dude, next part is the best part.
00:07:29 Get fucking hype for it. You're going to love it. It's the worst. I want to kill that man.
00:07:32 It's usually the fact that those people exist that they think hyping something up is a good idea.
00:07:37 Dude, let me tell you.
00:07:39 The hype itself is just sort of like sometimes it can be good.
00:07:43 It's not that they think it's a good idea.
00:07:45 It's that they want to do that to vicariously experience it through you as they can.
00:07:53 It's for themselves.
00:07:55 Let me tell you this little story about this guy I went to school with named Jarvis.
00:07:59 Jarvis? No, it was Jarvis.
00:08:03 This guy, he was in the anime club with me and he just loved.
00:08:10 Yeah, it was great. He just loved.
00:08:12 We always come up to be like, yo, guy, what are you watching right now?
00:08:17 And I'd be like, I don't know, Tsukuyomi or something.
00:08:22 We watched that one time and he was like, dude, that show is fucking great.
00:08:26 What episode do you want? I'm like, I don't know, episode three.
00:08:29 He was like, dude, episode four where, and he would describe the events that happen in that episode.
00:08:34 He's like, get ready for it, dude, you're going to love it.
00:08:37 So not only did this guy spoil everything that happened in every,
00:08:40 and he would insist on telling me these things every time.
00:08:44 I had to go out of my way to avoid him.
00:08:46 Like, this happened with every game, every show,
00:08:49 because this guy was an ultra-weeb.
00:08:51 He knew it all. He knew every single thing that I'd watched years before I'd seen it.
00:08:55 And just would insist.
00:08:57 It was this bizarre combination of trying to hype me and enjoying watching me be spoiled,
00:09:01 because I told him over and over, I didn't want to fucking know anything.
00:09:04 I think he had a massive impact on my viewing of spoilers and hype in my life in general overall.
00:09:10 That's understandable, man.
00:09:12 I do not relate to anything that's being said here pretty much.
00:09:16 Really? Interesting.
00:09:18 Get the hell out, Davoo. Who invited you anyway?
00:09:21 I think that the more familiar you get with a medium or a craft or a scene,
00:09:26 the more that you can manage your hype emotions.
00:09:30 And with video games at least, I've mastered the arts of no matter what I'm told,
00:09:35 no matter what expectation I have, no matter how I feel going into it,
00:09:38 I'm able to jujitsu everything around to maximize my enjoyment levels every time I play a game.
00:09:44 I don't buy that.
00:09:46 I think, I totally do.
00:09:48 People told me that Undertale was like, this cool game that's coming out and like, I don't care.
00:09:53 People can tell me something is a 12 out of 10 and it doesn't resonate with me at all on its own.
00:09:58 It can depend on who it is that says it.
00:10:00 And with Undertale, people told me you, Davoo, will like it because it's like Mario and Luigi in those kinds of games
00:10:08 and has similar elements.
00:10:09 I'm like, whoa, that got me interested.
00:10:11 When I went into Undertale, I was kind of in a downer mood.
00:10:14 I'm like, I'm going to try to dislike this just to see how much I like it.
00:10:18 Well, that's having an effect on you with that right there.
00:10:21 Within 30 seconds, I was completely into it.
00:10:24 Yeah, but what if you hadn't been though?
00:10:27 What if you had gone in with that same attempt to be like, I'm going to,
00:10:31 because I also played Undertale like, I'm probably not going to like this.
00:10:35 Everyone else is hyping this.
00:10:36 I'm just going to fucking shit on it.
00:10:38 And then I played it and I was like, that's pretty all right.
00:10:42 But like, I think that just speaks to the strength of the game,
00:10:45 whereas if it had been a weaker game and I'd went in with those expectations and I would have come out hating it,
00:10:50 even though like, I think there's plenty of stuff that's not that good that you can go in underhyped
00:10:58 and because it exceeds your expectations, you like it more.
00:11:02 Yeah, that's the great thing about being underhyped.
00:11:04 All that lower expectations, everything above that just makes it better when you finally see it, usually.
00:11:10 Which is a great thing.
00:11:11 Like, for instance, the show that me and D'Vu just watched because he had two for my series,
00:11:16 Raku Dai Kishi No Cavalry or Chivalry of a Filled Knight,
00:11:20 which is like a show that I dropped after the first episode when it was airing
00:11:25 and I thought it was, you know, pretty shitty.
00:11:27 But like, people were telling me, oh, it's better than Asterisk War,
00:11:30 because it's like kind of the same show.
00:11:32 So I was like, well, I'm going to watch it just so I can talk about it in my video
00:11:36 and I had no expectations.
00:11:38 And so when it turned out to actually be kind of okay,
00:11:41 it was so much better than I expected it to be.
00:11:44 Right.
00:11:45 That it was like overall a positive experience.
00:11:47 Whereas I've had times...
00:11:48 That was an anti-hype effect.
00:11:49 Yeah, whereas I've had times with shows like that I would give like a 6 out of 10,
00:11:53 but because like, my overall feelings about Chivalry were positive,
00:11:58 even though I'd give it like a strong 5 to a light 6,
00:12:00 whereas say with the Madoka Magica 3rd movie,
00:12:03 like, you know, I expected it to be something cool
00:12:06 and then I just kind of thought it was a 5 or a 6,
00:12:08 but it was such a let down that it then was...
00:12:11 I'm going to let you finish about Chivalry,
00:12:13 but Bushido is the best code of ethics to live by of them all.
00:12:18 Best of all time.
00:12:19 Yeah, well, let's talk about that only after they make an anime about it.
00:12:24 That's true.
00:12:25 Gabe, you were saying something.
00:12:27 It's hard to put into words what my argument is.
00:12:30 I'm trying to think because, like, things are hyped for me a lot,
00:12:35 but I usually only listen to the people I trust the opinions of,
00:12:39 like when you guys would tell me to say,
00:12:41 this game or this anime is great, you should watch it,
00:12:44 and I go watch it, and I have a good time,
00:12:47 even though like you said, like, you know,
00:12:50 you especially hype things up a lot.
00:12:53 I say everything's the best ever.
00:12:55 You say everything's the best ever,
00:12:56 and you're like, it's the greatest thing I've ever seen,
00:12:58 and I go and see it, and I'm like, yeah, you know,
00:13:01 I don't really feel, I don't ever get, like, disappointed
00:13:04 that something is not the greatest thing I've ever seen.
00:13:07 That's because I have the best taste, but, you know.
00:13:09 Are you saying, like, here's the thing though, Nate.
00:13:12 Like, I naturally don't feel, I don't get disappointed like that,
00:13:18 the other person to me.
00:13:19 I think, Nate, that the problem with hype,
00:13:22 because, yeah, now that Hippo mentions it,
00:13:24 it's super ironic that you are anti-hype,
00:13:26 but you hype people up all the time.
00:13:29 I don't want to be hyped.
00:13:30 I don't care about other people.
00:13:31 They can deal with it.
00:13:32 The problem is that I think everyone has that same mindset though,
00:13:36 that everyone thinks that their taste is great,
00:13:38 and that everyone's going to like the stuff they like,
00:13:40 and I think that's where a lot of hype comes from,
00:13:42 because, like, for me, you know, sort of like DeVoo,
00:13:46 I'm pretty resistant to hype for the most part,
00:13:48 where, like, I only really get hyped for stuff
00:13:50 if, like, people who really know me are hyping me for it, you know?
00:13:54 Because of the fact that I don't think many people like the things I like,
00:13:58 or dislike the things I dislike,
00:14:00 where, you know, like, with the current season shows,
00:14:03 like, erased, where there's all these people hyping fucking erased,
00:14:06 and everyone's shitting on me for not liking it and stuff,
00:14:08 and it's like, yeah, but if you knew my taste,
00:14:10 then this should be obvious.
00:14:12 Like, everyone should know that I'm not going to like this show,
00:14:14 so when people hype it, I wasn't buying into it,
00:14:16 because I'm like, what do you like?
00:14:19 You know, what are the other shows you like?
00:14:21 They obviously are not to my taste.
00:14:23 It's one thing if, like, if someone who likes all the same shows I like,
00:14:28 you know, hypes me for a new show,
00:14:30 and I'd be like, well, you know, I'm generally in my experience,
00:14:34 we've loved all the same things, so now I'm excited, you know?
00:14:37 Well, that's the thing, that's why I so look forward to recommendations from DeVoo,
00:14:41 because DeVoo likes tons of shit that I like,
00:14:43 and too, it's in terms of games.
00:14:45 You guys both seem to like really unique games.
00:14:48 That's true.
00:14:50 Really, like you were saying, there's kind of two different ways of being hyped for something.
00:14:55 There's like personal accounts of people you know telling you how good it is,
00:14:59 and that kind of shit, and I guess the lines are kind of blurred
00:15:01 since we're online figures who get comments from people,
00:15:04 but the other one is the endless cascade of people talking about shit,
00:15:08 like the new Star Wars or whatever.
00:15:10 There's literally no way to not be hyped for it,
00:15:13 because everyone in the fucking world is talking about it.
00:15:16 I think I generally take hype not very seriously at all.
00:15:22 I see that there's hype for Star Wars, for example,
00:15:26 and then I would go to all the reviewer and analysis people that I know
00:15:30 if they're talking about it and what they think,
00:15:33 and then I would form an opinion based on that.
00:15:35 The fact that there's hype on something,
00:15:37 like everybody's raving about this new thing,
00:15:39 I would look into it before feeling excited at all,
00:15:43 even if it was like a sequel to a game that I really liked or something.
00:15:47 Let's talk about Resistance 2 and or knowing how to manage hype
00:15:53 versus just being jaded generally.
00:15:56 Resistance 2 Fall of Man for the PlayStation 3 is the greatest game I've ever made.
00:16:01 Because I would say I'm somewhat resistant to hype,
00:16:05 but I think I would just say that's more that I'm generally jaded,
00:16:08 because when someone tells me something's good, I just don't believe them.
00:16:11 Even if I'm just...
00:16:14 Fall of Man was Resistance 1. I'm just pointing this out.
00:16:18 Glad we established that.
00:16:20 I've never played those games, and I think that I hate them actually.
00:16:24 They're all right.
00:16:26 If I saw all the Undertale hype going on now,
00:16:31 and I hadn't played it yet, I would think,
00:16:33 oh, that game looks stupid.
00:16:35 I'm sure it's not as good as everyone says it is.
00:16:38 I have this friend who recommended me this manga called Helc.
00:16:43 Have you guys seen this manga, Helc?
00:16:45 Anyone know what I'm fucking talking about?
00:16:47 Oh, man.
00:16:48 You told me a little about it yesterday, but no.
00:16:50 Helc. It's great.
00:16:51 But I have one friend who just said,
00:16:55 read this, it's awesome.
00:16:57 And I was like, okay, one person says it's awesome.
00:17:01 That's like...
00:17:02 No matter how highly one person praises something,
00:17:06 that's still just a little tiny blip on the hype radar,
00:17:09 no matter how glowing the review is.
00:17:11 So I don't know.
00:17:12 But I read it, and because I only had that little tiny bit of hype,
00:17:15 I thought it was pretty good, and I was like,
00:17:17 oh, yeah, okay, I actually like it.
00:17:19 Anyway, I guess the point I'm trying to make
00:17:21 is that I just don't believe anything is going to be good,
00:17:24 no matter how many people tell me it is.
00:17:26 That's good.
00:17:27 And in fact, the more people tell me that something's good,
00:17:33 and I don't know for a fact that it is good,
00:17:35 the more I start to be like, no, it isn't.
00:17:37 No, it's not.
00:17:38 No, it's not in my head.
00:17:39 They're clearly lying.
00:17:40 They're clearly just bought into the hype.
00:17:43 I feel very differently that I accept that sometimes
00:17:48 my taste might be very normal.
00:17:51 So if a lot of people like something,
00:17:53 I might like it as well.
00:17:55 I'm not as much of a hipster, I think, is the terror.
00:17:58 That's true.
00:17:59 I don't think you are.
00:18:00 Ironically, despite everything I just said,
00:18:02 and despite how much of a fucking hipster I am,
00:18:05 I still find that when lots of people like something,
00:18:08 I tend to like it too.
00:18:09 Yeah, I think it's pretty good.
00:18:10 And it makes me really mad.
00:18:11 It's pretty gay to...
00:18:13 I hate people who instantly have this knee-jerk reaction
00:18:16 of, if everyone is saying it's great that it must be terrible
00:18:20 because people are all secretly sheep and they're stupid.
00:18:23 Jesse, I feel that way.
00:18:25 Intellectually, I feel that way.
00:18:27 If everyone likes something, I feel like I'm going to hate it,
00:18:30 but in practice, it always ends up being
00:18:32 that if something's wicked popular, I end up liking it too.
00:18:34 Yeah, there's usually...
00:18:35 Like, home-stuck and undertale.
00:18:37 And I'll bet if I saw the new Star Wars, I would think it was fucking great,
00:18:40 even though I want to hate it so much.
00:18:42 There's usually a reason why a billion people like something.
00:18:45 See, that's the thing, though.
00:18:47 There's an interesting correlation here
00:18:49 between marketing and hype.
00:18:52 Because on 4chan, all the time, you'll see false flaggers
00:18:56 who just make threads praising something,
00:18:59 and they do it in a way that's obviously like a shilling sort of way
00:19:03 of praising it in an attempt to draw hatred for that thing.
00:19:07 And then there's...
00:19:08 This has happened many times.
00:19:10 There's been actual shills on 4chan who just come in
00:19:13 and are like, guys, how have you not bought a PS4 yet?
00:19:16 It is by far the best system.
00:19:18 I'm playing it every day with my hot girlfriend.
00:19:20 What are you doing with your life?
00:19:22 I got to...
00:19:23 In response to what Ben said, though,
00:19:25 I think it's sort of a...
00:19:27 I don't know if false positive is the right phrase for this.
00:19:30 Anyway, I think that you're looking at it backwards,
00:19:34 because...
00:19:35 I am?
00:19:36 Yeah, maybe the things you like tend to be popular,
00:19:40 but that doesn't mean that the things that are popular
00:19:42 tend to be things that you like.
00:19:44 For instance, if we measure just sheer popularity,
00:19:48 like Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty
00:19:50 are the most popular games,
00:19:52 and I don't think any of us give a fuck about them.
00:19:54 I have never played any of those.
00:19:56 Maybe I'd love them.
00:19:58 I did a huge research project four years ago,
00:20:02 or maybe even five, on my anime list,
00:20:05 where I was looking into all of my favorite shows
00:20:07 and trying to measure how my tastes stand up to everyone else's,
00:20:11 because I consider my anime list to be a really good gauge
00:20:13 for the common man anime fan.
00:20:16 A lot of the stuff that's the highest rated
00:20:19 or the most popular on the site is stuff I don't care about.
00:20:22 However, all of my favorite shows were well rated on the site
00:20:26 and were pretty popular.
00:20:28 None of them were something that no one had ever heard of.
00:20:31 None of them were below a 7.5 rating.
00:20:34 They're all pretty well liked and pretty popular.
00:20:37 It's not that I like everything that's popular.
00:20:40 It's just that the things I like do align with some other people.
00:20:44 Nothing I like is so out there that no one else knows about it
00:20:48 or no one else cares about it.
00:20:50 I guess I would say I'm in pretty much the same boat there.
00:20:53 I think the big thing that I don't relate to
00:20:56 is this idea that your different perspectives
00:20:58 have to blend together into one overall.
00:21:00 There's something that's talked about
00:21:02 in the beginning of A Book of Lenses by Jesse Schiel
00:21:05 about the art of game design, about how to analyze a game while you play it.
00:21:08 It's called the Holographic Experience,
00:21:11 in which you play the game purely while simultaneously
00:21:15 you're like a ghost looking at yourself
00:21:17 and studying it at the same time.
00:21:20 It sounds very Buddhist.
00:21:22 In becoming an analyst, I'm able to do that.
00:21:29 I'm able to look at all these different perspectives
00:21:32 at the same time.
00:21:34 I'm able to think about its cultural perspective,
00:21:37 my baggage going into it,
00:21:39 because baggage can be interesting.
00:21:41 Baggage can be from Louis Vuitton.
00:21:43 It can be really luxury.
00:21:45 I can enjoy everything simultaneously.
00:21:48 I don't need... I really think that my experience...
00:21:51 These Time Cube references are very distracting.
00:21:54 I can't pay attention to your point when you keep saying simultaneously.
00:21:58 Basically, it's about the Time Cube principle.
00:22:00 I'm looking at four different timelines
00:22:04 of my experience at once.
00:22:07 You can't say the top and bottom are sides,
00:22:09 so obviously they don't count.
00:22:11 They're not part of the queue.
00:22:13 I'm looking at two Radgai Kishinokavari, whatever.
00:22:17 I was like, oh, I guess it's going to be decent.
00:22:19 I really think that my opinion of it
00:22:22 was not overall changed by my expectations.
00:22:25 Episode 11 happened and I'm like, oh, that was terrible.
00:22:27 I don't like this show.
00:22:29 I don't think it's that your opinion is swayed by your expectations.
00:22:32 I don't think that's necessarily what we're arguing.
00:22:34 It's more the overall experience.
00:22:37 Like I said, Cavalry and Madoka Movie 3,
00:22:42 I would give the same score.
00:22:44 It's just a matter of one I went into with no expectations
00:22:47 and because it exceeded them so much,
00:22:49 then it was like, wow, I experienced something that was better
00:22:52 than I expected it to be and that makes me feel good.
00:22:55 Whereas with Madoka, it was like,
00:22:57 I expected to see like a seven out of ten
00:22:59 and I got like a five and so it was a disappointment,
00:23:02 even though I like both shows the same amount.
00:23:05 Do those feelings last at all
00:23:08 or are they just like memories of having feelings?
00:23:10 I think they continue to last
00:23:12 because I still have a sour feeling over the Madoka Movie
00:23:15 just because I felt like it should have been better.
00:23:18 So in that way, it would be like,
00:23:21 the best idea would to be to assume that everything is shit.
00:23:25 Yeah, pretty much.
00:23:27 But I can't do that though.
00:23:29 That's what I'm saying. All hype is bad.
00:23:31 Negative hype makes you experience a work more positively.
00:23:35 I can't do that like legitimately.
00:23:38 I can pretend to say, this is going to be bad.
00:23:41 Well, nobody can force themselves to think that way.
00:23:43 I usually have a very positive outlook,
00:23:46 but I don't have a very high one.
00:23:48 My point came out a whole lot less cogent.
00:23:50 But I never get really blown away either.
00:23:52 My point came out a whole lot less cogent
00:23:54 because I was sitting on it for 20 minutes
00:23:56 and when I sit on something for 20 minutes,
00:23:58 it comes out really uncogent.
00:24:00 That's what your mom said about my dick.
00:24:02 I just get really anxious when I sit on it for too long.
00:24:05 It wasn't cogent.
00:24:07 If I interrupted everyone at the beginning,
00:24:09 it would have come out really eloquent.
00:24:11 Well, here's something I've been sitting on for 20 fucking minutes.
00:24:13 It doesn't affect my enjoyment level.
00:24:15 It can make it better and it never makes it worse.
00:24:18 Here's something I've been sitting on for 20 minutes.
00:24:20 It was at the risk of bringing this up too early
00:24:23 and it would have just ended the whole conversation.
00:24:25 I wanted to detail Yahtzee's feelings on hype
00:24:29 that he shared in a video once.
00:24:31 Are you talking about the Punnett Square?
00:24:33 Yeah, it's the square where he says
00:24:35 if you go into something with high expectations
00:24:38 and it meets those expectations
00:24:40 then it'll be great.
00:24:42 If you go into something with high expectations
00:24:44 and it doesn't meet those expectations
00:24:46 then you'll feel like shit.
00:24:48 If you go into something with low expectations
00:24:50 and it turns out to be shit
00:24:51 then you won't lose anything.
00:24:53 If you go in with low expectations
00:24:55 and it turns out to be amazing
00:24:57 then it will way exceed your expectations
00:24:59 and it will be great.
00:25:01 Expectations nothing can ever hurt you if you go in with high expectations then sometimes you'll get burned
00:25:09 Sometimes you'll get that transcendent experience like I did with undertale where you have hype and then it's better than you thought and like
00:25:16 What do you want to do? Do you want to spend your life avoiding harm?
00:25:19 I just think I think that when you I think you should just manage your hype
00:25:24 Carefully there are there are movies. I've seen where like okay
00:25:27 My brother Victor has a tendency to hype things like when he likes it because yeah, like like like all of us
00:25:33 He's fairly jaded and fairly, you know critical
00:25:37 But he also has pretty different tastes from me and like it's funny because it's weird to him
00:25:42 Like he's so used to us having the same taste that when he likes something that I don't really care about then
00:25:47 It's like he doesn't expect it and it's kind of jarring
00:25:50 So he'll hype me for stuff that he likes and then I'll watch it and I'll be like I
00:25:54 Didn't really like it just seemed okay to me and he'll be like what like I can't I can't grasp that you didn't like this as much
00:26:01 As I did you know so like I have had times where like like we watched this movie
00:26:05 Confessions which is like one of his top three favorite movies and like I watched it and it was just kind of like I
00:26:10 Expected so much more just because he kept talking about how much he loved it and then I was like I don't like I don't get it
00:26:18 You know
00:26:19 So I feel like if I had just seen it with no expectations
00:26:22 It would have probably been better than then with the ones I did have but like I do think that there is some value in like
00:26:30 Managing your hype and like getting if I think if you know you're gonna love something then yeah
00:26:36 Let yourself get hype for it. Like I but can you ever really know that?
00:26:39 I think you can because I think there's times where the hype is like it doesn't matter
00:26:45 It won't change it like for last year the most hype
00:26:48 I got about anything was for the video game dengeki bunko fighting climax
00:26:52 Oh, right out in like September no October and I was hyped for it for like six months because it's a game where you play as
00:27:00 Characters from dengeki bunko light novels and it's a 2d fighting game and like I love 2d fighting games inherently
00:27:06 I'll play any of them, you know, and I love that I got to beat up all these characters that I hate
00:27:12 You were in this game
00:27:13 I get to beat up Kirito and Shana or play Shana and beat up Kirito
00:27:17 I get to play characters. I like characters. I hate and like it didn't even matter to me if the game was going to be like
00:27:24 Legitimately good or not like it was gonna be worth the price of admission just for the experience of a 2d fighter where I can beat up
00:27:31 Kirito, that's true. That's a pretty safe bet
00:27:34 Yeah, no matter what it was gonna be cool
00:27:36 So I got really hype for it and it did end up being as good as I wanted it to be like it was every bit as fun as I
00:27:43 hoped it would be and so like I felt like it was money well-spent
00:27:46 Well, you know, did you an example that involves you actually for me was when I
00:27:51 Tried to watch log horizon because this was after seeing your like 10 out of 10 video and I was like well
00:27:57 I have to check this out. This sounds exactly like what I like
00:27:59 and I think that I would have liked it more if I hadn't had these crazy expectations and
00:28:05 Like I got specifically I was looking forward to like the arguments you made of like the whole food thing
00:28:11 How it like changed the world and everything it does to the story and that stuff was in fact interesting
00:28:16 But I really was just on the lookout for like, okay, this is a 10 out of 10. I need to study it
00:28:21 I need to be looking for why this is the case
00:28:23 Yeah, and as a problem like when I watched along horizon
00:28:27 I had only heard that it was mediocre. No one ever told me it was good
00:28:31 We came in with totally opposite expectations. Yeah. Yeah, I think your relationship with hype
00:28:36 Can needs to be changed and evolved as your relationship with that medium or that genre
00:28:42 Changes, I think that I think hype is very important to get someone into a thing
00:28:49 You keep talking about anime. I didn't have enough people
00:28:52 Hyping me up to anime shows. I I didn't all the people who I talked to even if they were anime fans
00:28:58 They were way too polite. They weren't if they had jumped down my throat. You had the weirdest anime fans around you, man
00:29:05 I've never met an anime fan who was like that. I've only met like a evangelical everyone must watch Naruto
00:29:11 Or else kill themselves
00:29:15 evangelicals and
00:29:19 I and so as a result I didn't get into anime until like I didn't really get into it until like two years ago
00:29:25 I didn't I didn't I wasn't gonna get into my little pony until a friend of mine said you've got to watch this
00:29:30 You gotta watch that and thank God
00:29:33 Yeah, Ben Ben told me to watch Milo, but Jesse would you describe it? Yeah, it was the best thing I ever did for you
00:29:38 What's going on? Are you are you an evangelical Jesse?
00:29:42 Never mind. You're you're not a fast enough move on
00:29:45 I think that hype is really important to get someone into a thing and that as you get more familiar with it
00:29:50 You can learn more about it or is that my knowledge that it exists and that it's generally okay
00:29:56 I do think it's hype
00:29:58 I think that I think I've when when I want people to get into anime
00:30:03 I do involve hype although at the same time when I'm trying to like I
00:30:09 Lately I try my hardest to not hype people when I introduced into something, you know
00:30:13 Like I'll say like when I tried to get you into a shield hero yesterday. I was just like it's a good manga
00:30:18 I think you'll like it. I did that I read the whole thing yesterday. Yeah, I saw you reading it
00:30:24 But like I was just like yeah, it's pretty good. Like it's not amazing, but it's pretty good. You should read it
00:30:29 I think you will like it. I don't think yeah, I think it's a 10 out of 10
00:30:33 But like yeah, you know
00:30:34 I think my expectations were just a tad bit above where they should have been I did read it
00:30:39 I liked the whole thing, but nothing like
00:30:42 Super-duper amazing happened which was what you were saying, but I didn't calibrate my expectations quite properly
00:30:49 All of your like 10 out of 10 recommendations can be a great
00:30:52 Proof that I am good at not being overhyped or underhyped or anything at the time
00:30:58 You gave like an 8 out of 10 to kill la kill and so I watched it
00:31:00 I was like this is a 10 and then you gave like a 10 out of 10 to log horizon and I watched it
00:31:05 I'm like I have some problems. So I give it a 9 you gave a 10 to ghost in a cell standalone complex
00:31:10 And I watched it and I was like I agree
00:31:12 This is a 10 you gave a 9 to serial experiments Lane and I watched it and like I don't get it
00:31:17 So I gave it a 6 and so like I think that there's I think I'm able to
00:31:24 For some reason I am making my points so much worse than I thought I did I think I'm getting overhyped about my own points
00:31:32 I legitimately think that's a thing that you go through a lot
00:31:35 I've watched you overhype yourself for your own points in the past in
00:31:41 Conversations, I've also watched you overhype your own abilities where you're like
00:31:45 I'm gonna have this done by the end of the day and then and the funny thing is
00:31:51 Every time DeVu has ever told me when he's gonna finish a video. I always tack a day on in my mind
00:31:58 He'll always say like I'm gonna have this done by like 10 p.m. And in my head. I'm like tomorrow, you know
00:32:06 He's like, okay
00:32:07 It's gonna be a few more hours cuz my internet died or because this or that went wrong and I always I never let myself
00:32:13 When the video is gonna be I
00:32:16 Lots of people do it lots of people do it, but guy is particularly bad not to overhype myself
00:32:20 But I am the best in the world at missing my own deadlines massive
00:32:24 Yeah, I've got like like there is one medium that is ruined by hype for me and that is analysis videos because
00:32:31 What the fuck those things don't I mean hype they do I hype them
00:32:36 Nobody else in the world
00:32:39 Aside from this group of people
00:32:43 Okay, nobody else goes holy shit guys, there's a new mr. Beaton
00:32:49 I was like guys you have to go fucking. Yeah, and then I ultimately don't care if I agree with anyone's opinions on any game
00:32:56 Any movie any show but if one of us thinks that some analysis is a 10 out of 10
00:33:02 And I don't or I do and that bothers me it bothers me that did you like nerd writer so much and won't
00:33:10 Criticize him as much as I want to and that bothers me
00:33:13 Wait, how much do you think I like nerd writer? I have no idea, but you gave me a top
00:33:19 You praised him pretty glowingly. I mean he is making
00:33:23 unbelievably consistent videos every good. Oh, they're consistent
00:33:28 Oh, I can do their kids. Oh, they're consistent, and they have nice down quality
00:33:33 All right nerd writer has made about a hundred fucking videos last year
00:33:38 Like and all of them have a little bit of intrigue in them
00:33:42 And that's a lot of intrigue when you add it all up if you watch all of this
00:33:46 I'm sure I want to watch all of this even if he only makes one point per video in the end
00:33:51 He's made 52 points Nate put out one video last year. Yeah, and I fucking crushed that
00:33:58 But you didn't put out any other fucking videos
00:34:01 So I think there's a value in something like I am way
00:34:05 I am more likely to stay
00:34:07 Excited for someone's channel if they keep putting out content all the time and I'm like oh man
00:34:12 You're hitting me with every different side nerd writer puts out videos on paintings never seen someone
00:34:17 Obviously on YouTube
00:34:20 I've never seen someone analyze poetry on YouTube before he covers
00:34:25 No one covers comics the way he covers comics. He makes videos but every subject matter in existence
00:34:31 That's what interesting about him
00:34:33 They're all too short and they all feel like they stop short of saying anything really substantial about whatever he's talking
00:34:39 I mean, that's true
00:34:40 But they still make a point in the end like there's still something interesting in there like we made the video about the
00:34:48 He made a video about the the painting that says this is not a pipe and he's like the point of this painting is that it's not a pipe
00:34:56 It's a representation of a pipe and therefore, you know when we look at images
00:34:59 We describe them as that's a like if I showed you a picture of a pipe, you'd say that's a pipe
00:35:04 But it's not a pipe. It's a representation of a pipe and it's a study of language interesting point
00:35:08 I hadn't not that interesting because that but what you just related to me is information that is obvious to any thinking person at a
00:35:15 Glance and I do not need to spend two minutes
00:35:19 Painting I would never have thought about that. Did you that's very obvious. That's literally the entire point of the painting
00:35:24 I've never seen the painting, but okay, here's the thing
00:35:31 Writer makes videos about things. I've never seen before is interesting enough in itself
00:35:37 I've never seen any of the movies. He's talked about except like children of men. I've never seen any of the paintings
00:35:42 He's talked about
00:35:43 Except maybe nightcrawlers, but I didn't know what it meant. I just seen it
00:35:46 I don't give a fuck. I've never thought about a painting before nerd writer has taught me to think about a font about a painting
00:35:54 Don't understand paintings at all. I just look at him. I'm like what the fuck is that? It's colors. I don't care
00:35:59 It doesn't move. It doesn't have dialogue. I don't fucking. I don't want to look at it
00:36:02 You know it really into the fact that he's had would you look at a painting if it had subtitles?
00:36:08 Well, they were Japanese this is not a pipe has subtitles and I still wouldn't have thought about what it meant, you know
00:36:13 I like I just want to go back to
00:36:17 Managing hype because that's the topic. Yes
00:36:23 The way the way that I manage hype
00:36:26 I've realized is that I base it completely on research for example
00:36:30 Dark Souls 3 is coming out soon and I'm extremely hyped for that because I know that the director is the same guy as Dark Souls 1
00:36:39 Miyazaki I forget his first name
00:36:43 Yeah, that's actually wrong. You know what that's that's actually that brings me to a great point though
00:36:48 Here's something we've all been skipping out on and Nate you kind of touched on this with like a risk in feeling
00:36:53 I I do think that there is a value in
00:36:57 Experiencing extreme disappointment. Yeah, I think that there are some things that you should just go all in
00:37:03 Let yourself get hyped for and just be crushed by because it can it can lead to
00:37:08 Years of you cathartically bashing it like Dark Souls 2
00:37:13 Very true
00:37:14 You know like with with Demon Souls because I don't know but I'm sure you guys probably played Dark Souls first
00:37:19 But like my friends were hyped for Demon Souls before that even came out because one of my friends is a huge from software fan
00:37:25 He was into armored core and all that shit and he was really excited for Demon Souls
00:37:28 So that came out and it exceeded everyone's expectations
00:37:31 We were super excited and then they were making Dark Souls and we all got like really hype and it came out and everyone was kind
00:37:36 Of like undecided at first like no one could decide if it was as good as years for people to figure out
00:37:41 Yeah, well cuz it you know at first it it had like a little bit more cheapness to it
00:37:46 And they also ironed a lot of stuff out in patches, you know, that was a problem
00:37:49 Yeah early part, but like, you know, it was kind of tepid but then people were like oh man
00:37:53 Dark Souls is the greatest game ever and then people got really hype and then they're like Dark Souls 2 and we're all like
00:37:58 Oh fuck yeah, and at this time no one knew about the like how important he did Takamiyazaki was or how like you know
00:38:05 Changing directors would change everything or any of that we were just like it's another Dark Souls
00:38:09 You know and then Dark Souls 2 came out and everyone played it and they're like oh, yeah, it's pretty it's pretty good
00:38:13 But it's not as good as Dark Souls one and then over time it just like you know
00:38:17 It just right people think about it a huge issue right and then like when Bloodborne was coming out
00:38:22 Then it was like well should we get hype like I want to get hype
00:38:25 But yeah, that's gonna be like Dark Souls 2, but Miyazaki's directing it again. Maybe it'll be amazing
00:38:29 Maybe I should stake it all on the line, you know
00:38:32 It was great. You're like all right. Well Miyazaki's never disappointed me
00:38:36 So surely Dark Souls 3, surely surely Dark Souls 3, surely
00:38:41 That's where I am right now. Yeah, I'm actually considering buying the collectors edition for that
00:38:46 And like if Dark Souls 3 turns out to be a huge piece of shit
00:38:49 We will talk about it for ever
00:38:51 It will be legendary if we like we will never shut up about it
00:38:56 You know and like I think there's some value in that worth like because when I think about
00:39:00 Hype and the dangers of hype the biggest thing that comes to mind is watchdogs because it was a game that was
00:39:05 Way overhyped for years all the trailers completely were misleading
00:39:09 They all made it look like it was gonna be this really deep like next-gen game
00:39:12 No one had ever seen like this level of like polish in a game before going by the trailers
00:39:18 Which were completely false, you know, and then it came out and it was just kind of a shitty talking about right
00:39:22 It wasn't even interesting. It was mediocre
00:39:24 So then and the thing is that game had sold so many like pre-order bonuses and special editions and everyone who got them got
00:39:31 Burned everyone special edition was like I shouldn't have got the special edition
00:39:35 It wasn't that good of a game games these like a lot of triple a games are more about the trailers than the game right
00:39:40 They're about establishing pre-order while like generating hype for the people who felt all that hype and then were let down
00:39:46 Like I'm sure that they they hate it and they wish they had that money back
00:39:49 And they wish they hadn't played that game
00:39:50 But like as a cultural thing it was kind of awesome to watch because it was like, you know watching this mighty like
00:39:58 Opening of the the fjord of people realizing that oh my god
00:40:02 Hype is bad and I should stop buying these expensive like you know, I my friend
00:40:07 My friend Josh who buys like special editions of everything like he was so burned by watchdogs that it made him rethink his buying habits
00:40:13 You know and like what what was in the special edition of watchdogs. I don't fucking know. It's probably like $95 though
00:40:20 It has Aiden's iconic hat. Oh good
00:40:23 I
00:40:25 Wanted I want to do we stop coming over on the topic on a cat nice while we're on the topic of our personal
00:40:32 Stories and personal and like particular height. Yeah, I wanted everyone to share a horror story
00:40:36 I want to talk about my own personal hype tragedy, please which was spore. I was gonna say I bet it was four
00:40:42 Yeah, yeah fucking spore tell us when the original trailer for spore came out. We'll write
00:40:48 You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know about I was big on this for hype
00:40:53 Lots of people were people all over. Yeah, will write came out and demoed this version of spore
00:40:58 Which was so fun
00:41:00 It looked so fucking robust and it looked like it just it made it look like anything was possible
00:41:05 And it played this this little like dinosaur man
00:41:07 And he just like twisted it around and like gave it three legs and it procedurally generated this perfect-looking walk cycle on three legs
00:41:14 And then he showed off all these other hypothetical monsters and they all had
00:41:18 Like yeah, they all like wobbled around realistically according to their weight and like he
00:41:23 It all just looks so real and visceral and like nothing that had ever existed before and then he zoomed out and you saw the solar system
00:41:30 And he zoomed out and you saw the whole galaxy and it was like oh my god
00:41:32 There's so much possibility and it's all gonna be procedurally generated and there's gonna be so much emergent content
00:41:38 And it's gonna be amazing and for two fucking years people talked about this shit for two fucking years
00:41:44 People said oh, here's what I'm gonna make in spore. Here's what I'm gonna make in spore
00:41:47 It's gonna be the greatest thing ever and then it came out and it looks nothing like the demo
00:41:51 It doesn't work. It doesn't it doesn't even behave similarly
00:41:55 I mean it kind of superficially resembles the demo
00:41:58 But it's not the same game and it doesn't have the same tone or atmosphere or capabilities
00:42:02 Yeah, and the whole thing was clearly just a fucking fabricated farce of a goddamn pre-rendered trailer because there's because there's no dang
00:42:09 Way you could do anything in the trailer that was in the dang final release, you know
00:42:13 And gosh, I'm still so salty about I'm with you
00:42:15 I think that will write in this case had the absolute best of intentions and thought he'd be able to do it
00:42:20 But I think when reality that's that fucking Peter Mullin. He was he was just channeling Peter Mullin
00:42:25 He's he really was that's the thing though
00:42:27 These people have really lofty goals put Peter Mullin you especially and will write in a lot too in this case
00:42:31 They want to do all the stuff and they they plan as if they'll be able to do it and they market it on these
00:42:37 Hypothetical like we'll definitely be able to do this and then like when they don't respect that in principle
00:42:43 I don't respect in principle at all
00:42:44 You cannot tell people that you are going to do X if you don't know for sure you can do it
00:42:49 I mean, I think what they should do though is if I think when this is the problem with the games marketing is that they will never
00:42:56 Admit it when it's not that you know like if like when fucking
00:43:01 When Peter Mullin you hypes up fucking fable 2 or whatever and says all this shit
00:43:05 Then when the game's about to come out and it doesn't have those capabilities. He should come out and say by the way
00:43:11 It's not gonna be like that. It's gonna be like this
00:43:13 We couldn't we didn't have the budget to make it as
00:43:19 Here's what Peter Mullin who does fable 2 comes out and it's a piece of shit, but he doesn't admit it
00:43:24 Until he starts hyping fable 3 right? Oh, yeah, great
00:43:29 You know I know we I had such great hopes for fable 2, but it ended up it was nothing like I wanted to be
00:43:35 It was basically a piece of shit, but I'm gonna accomplish everything I set out to do with it
00:43:38 And more and fable 3 fable 3 will finally be the great game
00:43:42 I've been promised then they come out and the same fucking thing when will they learn
00:43:46 Triple A the video game big budget hype machine is the worst type machine. Yeah, especially
00:43:53 There's a huge issue of like I don't know
00:43:58 Really deception like something like Dark Souls 2 does not look anything like the
00:44:03 Videos that they show it looks like shit compared to the video all they had to do it
00:44:07 They knew it right like I'm sure because the thing is with Dark Souls 2
00:44:11 I'm sure that they did intend that system to be in there because if you look at Bloodborne
00:44:15 It does have like the torches and the lighting right like that was supposed to be in Dark Souls 2
00:44:19 But yeah, they should have just put out a statement. Hey this trailer no longer represents what the game is, you know, right?
00:44:25 It would have been so easy and and you you know, it'll disappoint people
00:44:29 But like at least it'll be honest and they won't fucking hate your guts from that on
00:44:33 Everything you say, you know hide behind shit like oh those trailers like they were just in development
00:44:38 But they never show you what it's actually gonna look like once it comes out
00:44:40 All you've got to base your thoughts on are the demos that they showed where it looks good or whatever
00:44:45 But you know like we're talking about how like companies literally just lie about what things are gonna be in regards to hype
00:44:51 But like that's like the worst case scenario. That's not even what you should normally is normally the issue with hype
00:44:57 There's it's it's it's everything before that about like expectations being set too high and then them not being met or you know
00:45:04 That that whole gamble you're taking me to do that the whole business is lying to you thing is the worst-case scenario really
00:45:10 I'm trying to like think of what my most like
00:45:13 Hyped up for something and then it wasn't yeah, it's a way to I think it's like I think for me
00:45:19 I would I would say that like
00:45:21 Because I'm so slow to actually get around to stuff my hype usually like just diminishes over time where like for instance when I was
00:45:30 Like a teenager
00:45:31 I was really into JRPGs and I just kept buying JRPGs because I was excited for all of them
00:45:36 And I just kept buying them
00:45:37 But I would never beat them or I would never play them very far and then it was just kind of like as I grew up
00:45:42 I sort of realized that those games were probably not gonna be fun
00:45:46 You know like a lot of the ones that I thought that like you know like I bought all the knee-punny
00:45:51 Gucci games at one point like cuz those have diminishing returns hard
00:45:55 Yeah, you go further in the series like cuz you know this guy a one everyone loved it
00:45:59 I had played a bunch of it
00:46:00 I thought it was pretty cool
00:46:01 But then like just because of like the idea of the company that it was like this this small
00:46:06 Publisher of like really interesting tactics games that no one was talking about you know and that were often hard to come by and I bought like you
00:46:14 know
00:46:16 Like lapissel tactics and fucking
00:46:20 Lapissel tactics was such a snorkel. Yeah, I gave up on that within like the first couple of hours
00:46:26 I bought lapissel. I bought fucking phantom brave
00:46:28 I bought Makaya for real and I bought this guy
00:46:32 And like I had all those games for a long time and like I played the first like a couple hours of lapissel as a kid
00:46:37 And like I just didn't understand mechanics
00:46:40 So like this is something I did a lot when I was younger
00:46:42 I would buy games and then play them and not really get them and that'd be like well
00:46:46 I'll probably get around to it in the future and I just hold on to these games forever
00:46:50 And then finally like ten years later
00:46:52 I put in lapissel and tried to play it and I realized it's just boring, you know
00:46:56 So like I feel like my hype back then was like all of these games are gonna be great one day
00:47:02 And then eventually I realized that I was just deluding myself and I don't know where I got this hype from you know
00:47:08 I hate the waiting sitting around waiting checking every preview that comes out waiting for it to come out
00:47:15 I ended that personally in 2008 with brawl because I was waiting for that so intensely and the delays
00:47:22 Killed my soul off in half so much and I played it. I'm like, oh, it's it's just like melee
00:47:28 You you sit down and have a good time for for infinity. It's not something
00:47:32 Yeah, I've never had like like a lot of I've never waited for a thing to come out like I I've I
00:47:38 Want Dark Souls 3 to come out really soon and it is and I'm happy that it's coming out
00:47:42 But I haven't been waiting for it. You know, I haven't been looking trailers
00:47:45 I don't really care to look here's here's what like information for man. That was for me
00:47:49 I just want to buy it when it comes out. Here's what more than years
00:47:52 I spent crawling around on spore forums just like fucking hyping myself up
00:47:56 Oh, no more than I don't get about waste of my god cycle is like most of these games are
00:48:03 Are going to be like a week of your life not anything past that like yeah
00:48:09 All the time you've already put in right people spend like years hyping themselves for a game
00:48:14 And then you beat it in like, you know 20 hours and it's like why did you like was that really worth that level of hype?
00:48:21 Like, you know, and then people get let down and I watched like my brother victor
00:48:25 He always lets himself get into the hype cycle because like he'll you know, he'll he only plays games once usually
00:48:31 Like it's very rare only like the souls games and like, you know a few other like games that he really truly loves
00:48:37 Well, he played more than once most games. He'll just get it and forget it
00:48:40 But he'll let himself
00:48:42 Like, you know constantly watch trailers and watch all the nintendo directs and get like all excited for games
00:48:47 And then like he spent like two and a half years being hyped for zeno blade chronicles x
00:48:51 And it came out and it was complete like, you know, and the thing is he'll you'll trick yourself
00:48:56 Like he spent the first like 35 hours like trying to convince himself that it was great
00:49:00 And then in the end just realized it was a huge disappointment. You know, I just I just remember the best example of all time
00:49:06 Final fantasy 13
00:49:08 Like i'm the biggest final fantasy fan in the entire universe and I too spent
00:49:12 You know 60 hours trying to like that game either writing was on the wall before 13 came out
00:49:17 So I didn't allow myself to get hyped for that one because dude. I loved 11. I loved 12 was a good game
00:49:23 But like
00:49:24 Now 12 was a good game but 11 was like an mmo and then there was advent children
00:49:29 Before that an advent children was like the thing that hurt me more than anything else ever to the point where
00:49:35 For years after advent children came out
00:49:38 I would like lie to myself and I still wouldn't want to admit how much I hated it
00:49:42 But then like every time I saw it subsequently
00:49:44 I I had to admit a little bit that's the thing
00:49:47 I I followed the chronicles of the compilation of final fantasy 7 shit so tightly like every scrap of information
00:49:54 Was like gold to me was like pure orgasm through my whole body
00:49:57 And like only this year have I finally realized I was I was just being fucking duped a whole fucking time
00:50:05 And it was so like and it was so like
00:50:07 Real and like such a juicy betrayal to me because it was because back in those days
00:50:13 Like I put my heart and soul into that series. It was like I was like
00:50:17 Like 14 or 13 when advent children came out or something. Yeah 15 16 hours
00:50:21 Fucking the baby, you know, like it was like before I had access to the internet or anything
00:50:27 So to me final fantasy 7 was just my thing and it was this beautiful thing from my childhood and no one else could ever
00:50:33 You know tarnish it and and oh my god. They're they're making a sequel to my game
00:50:40 And then I and then it's not just a ever made like a
00:50:44 Philosophical thing like on principle. I will heighten myself down
00:50:48 The more you learn about the context of the way things come out the more, you know
00:50:53 Logically it is most likely not going to be like there's nothing that can logically make you guaranteed
00:51:00 That something is going to be great. I don't know if that's true game series any game developer
00:51:05 Any place that a game can come from that will guarantee it being good
00:51:10 Yeah to me and did you I remember you saying that you're like that with anime your last bastion was
00:51:16 Tell you had a one last bastion of like this is definitely going to be good, but it got broken recently. What was it?
00:51:23 No, I don't even like most keo any shows. I don't even like half of their shows
00:51:29 Um, but there was probably something that was oh, yeah shinichiro watanabe because he what do you mean?
00:51:36 Because he made fucking zankyo no terror and it was complete garbage. Oh, that's right. That's right
00:51:40 Like it was he was like the one director who had only done three shows and they were all amazing
00:51:45 And like everything he'd worked on otherwise was like little artsy stuff and like, you know
00:51:49 It was like he could he couldn't possibly do wrong
00:51:52 And then zankyo no terror came out and like the first three episodes or first two episodes are like amazing
00:51:57 And then they're it just spirals down and it's a piece of shit
00:52:00 The only thing that I can rely on to be good is when I know that the people in charge of creating it
00:52:06 Have the same tastes and roughly the same vision as myself
00:52:10 Which is why I do get hyped for some analysis shows because I for one thing
00:52:14 There's almost no waiting it comes out and I get hyped in three seconds to watch it and I know where they're coming
00:52:20 But you know the scary thing is that over a long period of time how the people behind the work change like
00:52:26 Like with with square enix and like how final fantasy has evolved and morph like it's the same series
00:52:31 But it is not what it once was
00:52:33 I think the internet has helped us a lot because now we can look into that shit. That's true. That's very no
00:52:37 I think I think with
00:52:39 I think every year we get closer and closer to people are paying attention to developers like specifically the people
00:52:45 We're like, you know with dark souls again
00:52:47 No one knew who hitataka miyazaki was until dark souls two sucked
00:52:51 No one no one knew who he was when dark souls one was great
00:52:55 People knew who he was when dark souls two sucked and we went for an explanation and the explanation was it wasn't the same director
00:53:01 You know that was when people went oh
00:53:03 Like that matters, you know like hitataka miyazaki's clearly the guy who's important here, you know
00:53:08 And then it became like well bloodborne's got his name on it. So maybe that'll be worth it
00:53:13 Oh dark souls three has his name on it. Maybe that'll be worth it
00:53:16 You know, but like I think every year we get we get more and more in the internet age
00:53:20 Like we're paying attention to that shit where um, you know, uh, I think that's good. It's true
00:53:25 It's it's a it's a hopeful sentiment and I I think yeah, but even then
00:53:29 I would be for the next the next thing that toby fox makes right sure
00:53:33 Absolutely
00:53:34 I think the more people are involved the more you need to look into it because like with
00:53:38 What davoo said about shinichiro watanabe like I just assumed everything he made would be good
00:53:42 But then like, you know
00:53:44 The writing staff and the people behind zankyo no terror were not the same people who wrote his other shows
00:53:50 You know, we're like he used a lot of the same staff on cowboy bebop and on uh and on you know
00:53:55 Samurai shampoo and it's like the writers for this show
00:53:58 Were the problem like the directing was not the problem with zankyo no terror
00:54:01 He did his job
00:54:02 It's just that the show had a terrible script and like on you know, he was a failure for not correctly assigning
00:54:09 I mean you could say so but like I think because it was his concept of a show and I get why he made it and like
00:54:15 What he was going for it's just that the writing did not deliver on the idea
00:54:20 And I think there was probably a point where
00:54:23 They maybe recognized that or maybe they didn't maybe they just thought it was you know
00:54:27 Maybe they thought the message was more important than that
00:54:30 Or they just went ahead with what they had because I don't you love that when people decide that the message of your show
00:54:36 Is more important than the entertainment value. Love that. Well, I I just think that like
00:54:41 I think with that particular show it was partly just they wanted to give him work because like
00:54:46 You know like Masao Mariama had been saying that he'd been trying to get a show with Shinichiro Watanabe for years
00:54:52 But it's just that it's too expensive to work with him because he's he's a really ambitious director
00:54:57 And he's going to make stuff look good. And so like I think you know
00:55:01 Mariama is the one who runs mappa and mappa was a fairly new studio
00:55:04 They hadn't really done a lot of work and they wanted to do something with Shinichiro Watanabe
00:55:08 And I think that was that's a nice goal. I think that was more important to them than making a well written show
00:55:14 I think they just wanted to make a show with Watanabe and that's why they succeeded
00:55:19 The thing with tobi fox because like at first I was like, oh, yeah the next tobi fox game
00:55:22 I'm probably gonna like that right because not only did I love undertale, but I loved
00:55:27 But like the ways in which I really liked it felt like tobi was doing things the way I would do them
00:55:34 Like I've made games
00:55:36 A couple years ago
00:55:37 What you only like things that are the way that you would do them well in the sense that he said trash in the sense that like
00:55:43 It makes me think he comes from a similar place. Obviously. He's better
00:55:47 But he comes from a similar place with similar tastes as me
00:55:50 It's not someone who made something that they like that I think is amazing for different reasons, you know
00:55:56 And well, I think that I think that what's good about undertale
00:55:59 I think or or I think I'm kind of agree with you
00:56:01 But for different reasons like I think that the ways in which undertale is good
00:56:06 Suggest a development philosophy that I can write. Yeah
00:56:09 Yeah, I think that you can tell that the way he went at it was to think of concepts first and then flesh to think of
00:56:15 Original concepts first and then flesh them out to a mechanic explain that something
00:56:18 I would like to see more like using an opposite like if you
00:56:22 Love sonichu
00:56:23 It's not because you think christian has similar intentions to you
00:56:28 Like you love sonichu for reasons that have nothing to do with why why christian like
00:56:33 I love sonichu for the emotional arc
00:56:36 So of the author right that you can glimpse the things you like about sonichu are not what christian intended
00:56:43 You to like about it. Nope. And therefore you could never look forward to his next work in that way
00:56:48 Whereas yeah, what's the shirt on my new level I can look at almost any detail and think
00:56:53 I think toby put that there and did that that way for this that and this reason
00:56:58 Don't know how accurate I am though because toby his his persona is so
00:57:04 Um timid he like acts like oh, I don't I didn't know
00:57:07 I was just trying to make a game with stuff that I like and everyone loves it. That's nice
00:57:12 I think he's probably like yeah, I'm a genius. I know exactly
00:57:15 I don't know what you're getting that. I mean, I'm sure there's some level of of confidence
00:57:19 I'm sure he's like that only because that's what I would be like
00:57:23 I too would project a facade of like not thinking I was the shit
00:57:26 But then secretly think he literally said all these people giving um 10 out of 10s
00:57:31 I got I you know some people give him an eight give undertale an eight like I expected
00:57:35 But then some people give it a 10 and I'm like you like it that much
00:57:39 Wow, we well frankly toby has absolutely no business trying to judge his game
00:57:45 In the in the world of all games out there and trying to decide where it belongs
00:57:49 Absolutely, yeah, I think it's fine. I'm just saying that it makes it a little bit harder like
00:57:55 Is he just accidentally a genius because I don't know what I really need to do
00:57:59 Is play other stuff that he's made play his earthbound mods and really get where he's coming from
00:58:05 On the subject of like there's no guarantee
00:58:08 That that like your hype will be justified like you can never know for sure if like the next output by someone's gonna be good
00:58:13 Um, I'm not gonna like the next toby game if it's like an undertale rehatch
00:58:17 I was gonna say yeah, I don't think it will be because what I think was good about undertale was the ways it experimented
00:58:22 So it's gonna be totally I'm gonna be looking I'm gonna be looking for like the new ideas that toby has right
00:58:28 And those things are gonna be new and therefore they're gonna be a risk
00:58:32 So there's only a chance that it'll be a really great game if he takes risks
00:58:36 But those risks are gonna come with the possibility that maybe they won't work out as well as they did an undertale
00:58:41 So there's there's really no guarantee. That's what hype is all about. I think it's it's more of a guarantee
00:58:47 than like other like just thinking of like it's it's better to think of like, you know, it's not I know but like
00:58:54 It it's better to it's more trying to think of the words
00:58:59 Well, you shouldn't you shouldn't get hype for a company's game. Yes, you get hype for the individuals who are making sure
00:59:05 I want to address like ironically the like the fact that to the fact that I expect toby to take a risk
00:59:10 Right in in being creative in in his next game like like taking that risk is a
00:59:15 Better is closer to guaranteeing that something will be good
00:59:18 Then not taking any risks because that guarantees that it'll be bad to address like devu's point about toby's like attitude
00:59:24 I think, you know
00:59:26 You might think that the things he did were genius
00:59:29 And like you might share the same ethos as him like I'm sure he put all those things in his game on purpose
00:59:35 And that they all serve the purpose he wanted them to but that doesn't necessarily mean that he thinks that that is genius
00:59:41 Like maybe he thinks that all those points he was making are like pretty clever
00:59:47 But like, you know that he doesn't think that it's worth a 10 out of 10
00:59:51 We're like, you know, and it comes down to personal values
00:59:54 Like devu you clearly value the things he did so much that you think it's a 10 out of 10 game
01:00:00 I don't you know, like I appreciate all of it and I think I understand all of it
01:00:05 But my values don't mean oh, that's automatically a 10, you know
01:00:09 And I think his surprise is that so many people value that and I'm surprised too
01:00:14 Like I would never have thought looking at undertale that it would get these
01:00:18 The sheer level of like game of the years that it got, you know, like yeah, like uh, well, you share nobody's because I definitely think
01:00:24 There's plenty of things that aren't great about it in one interview
01:00:29 He said, you know, I came up with the whole mercy system
01:00:31 And you know, it's kind of it's not that great because it's basically just a bunch of trial and error
01:00:36 But I wrote some decent dialogue to make it good and I read that I'm like, yeah
01:00:39 I agree the the mercy system for most regular enemies is not like that in in
01:00:44 In thralling all the time, but it just goes back to I don't think that something needs to be
01:00:49 Objectively perfect to be a 10 out of 10
01:00:51 Yeah, wait
01:00:52 You have to look at the way that he used it because like what my favorite example
01:00:55 I think of that in the whole game is the way that you have to that you mercy
01:00:59 The tsundere plane which involves like you have to come close to it and like brush against it
01:01:05 Which relates to its personality and is like the most genius thing I've ever seen
01:01:08 That's the thing like all of that is genius
01:01:10 But it's not necessarily something that you expect people to value where like sure like in a games market where you know
01:01:17 Because if you look at like
01:01:18 Game spots game of the year list like that's the one where I what I would have expected where they put undertale at like number 16
01:01:25 You know and like number one is the witcher 3 which is this huge
01:01:29 Oh, it's like everything that games journalism seems to value in a game is what the witcher 3 represents
01:01:35 You know what it reminds me of the way that like the oscars judge like best editor
01:01:40 It's not like who made like the highest quality game. It's who made like the most game
01:01:45 Who put it like the most that just tends to be what most people value is people tend to value like
01:01:50 What's the biggest bestest most insane thing that had to happen?
01:01:54 You know like the the one that's the closest to the gold standard and like you would never expect that a fucking
01:02:00 A game that looks like it was on the goddamn
01:02:02 NES would be the you know would be anyone's game of the year pick from like a professional journalist
01:02:08 You know you can imagine I think the point I was trying to make earlier. Yeah, I get
01:02:12 the the point was um
01:02:14 You shouldn't ever think that a person
01:02:18 Being on a team or like a company making a game would guarantee
01:02:22 Even if they have a good track record
01:02:24 You should never think that it guarantees it to be good, but it can it's okay to like
01:02:30 Feel a little better about all this discussion and no one has mentioned metal gear solid 5 which burned all of you
01:02:37 I was trying not to mention it and not to think about it. So thank you so much. I totally forgot about that. Yeah
01:02:45 Oh, Jesus christ. I didn't even remember that. Yeah, it's same director who made all the other games
01:02:51 Now there was a lot of drama around it when it came out which kind of maybe sort of absolves him a little bit
01:02:59 We won't know exactly whether
01:03:00 Kojima himself is responsible until we see his next game and if it's really good then
01:03:05 I am well you actually
01:03:07 You can look closer and you can see patterns here because he didn't write the games himself
01:03:13 Alone until metal gear solid 4
01:03:15 Everything 1 2 and 3 were written by some other guy who's much much better at writing
01:03:19 And that's why like the writing in those games is worlds better. So it does
01:03:23 It was nano machines kind of thing. Yeah, it's clearly a george lucas thing
01:03:27 He he got more control and as a result thing
01:03:29 But like the biggest problems in five the biggest ones are that the game just isn't finished
01:03:34 And I think those come down to konami issues with them not giving him the budget to finish the game
01:03:38 It's deciding. You know what? We've spent enough money put it out the door. It's playable. That's it
01:03:42 We don't we don't completely know and I think it's I think the danger with that game was that there were four
01:03:48 Like I mean there were there were three amazing metal gear solid games and one pretty great one
01:03:52 And then you know, you have no reason to expect it's not going to be great
01:03:56 You have no there's no one that you notice has changed because the only name anyone knows is hideo kojima
01:04:01 He plashes it all over everything. So everyone sees him as the guy the beginning of every mission guys
01:04:07 Guess who made the game
01:04:08 But like is he what a fucking guy was he the only one responsible for all these games being great?
01:04:14 Or is it clear that he was not one of the guys or that there's more going on that we don't know and like yeah
01:04:20 Even with the name recognition like
01:04:22 Again, or whatever you shouldn't get you shouldn't just immediately be like. Oh my god. It's a kojima game
01:04:28 It's gonna be amazing. It's well a lot of people work on those, you know
01:04:32 I think we also have to go ahead whatever
01:04:36 No, no you go. Oh well going back to hype. I think that uh
01:04:40 I think that hype affected how the game was developed and designed
01:04:44 negatively in a way because
01:04:46 It reeks of that
01:04:47 Philosophy of everything needs to be open world and appeal to everyone in the world and right that kind of thing and it's just
01:04:53 That's just the game hype cycle and it's how all games are made now
01:04:56 This is an all new thing to talk about is how hype will affect the development of the thing
01:05:00 Which I think is has way more of a direct effect than how it affects my experience
01:05:06 Okay, yeah, maybe for someone like you who says that it doesn't really affect him
01:05:09 That's totally true because like look at look it's god
01:05:11 It pisses me off so much that like the audience has now become part of the process of making the game
01:05:17 It's like our reaction to these trailers like like street fighter 5 right too much ass on on cammy and uh on mika
01:05:24 We got to get rid of that shit and like the the guys didn't intend that from the start or they would have made it that way
01:05:30 They change things to and it's I don't know if that's you can like that or just like that
01:05:34 That's just the audience it's the audience's response right, but I do think that like hype
01:05:40 Creates the danger of every installment has to be better than the last and it makes people
01:05:45 Like if you make something successful, then you always feel like you have to one up yourself and like
01:05:50 It it kind of disgusts me because everyone
01:05:53 Talks this way and I mean everyone even people who hate hype who say this and that like if you make a new game
01:05:59 And it's not as good as your old game people are going to say so constantly
01:06:04 All anyone's gonna like uh bastion versus transistor right like bastion came out and it was super hyped because like
01:06:12 It was a you know game that nobody expected
01:06:13 But it was really great and it had this great narration and everything and then transistor came out and all anyone talked about
01:06:19 Was how it compares to bastion. Oh, it's right. It's it's kind of the same
01:06:23 But it's not it's not quite as good the narrative isn't quite as interesting
01:06:27 Listen that and it's like dude. It's a different game like forget about fucking bastion talk about fucking transistor
01:06:33 You know like totally different art style different story different characters
01:06:37 It's not a sequel in any way
01:06:39 But like you know, that's what the hype cycle does to people is they always expect the next one to be better
01:06:44 And to be this huge evolution. Yeah
01:06:46 And what if it's just good, you know, like that's like the issue with something good
01:06:50 Yeah, people aren't judging continuing works by if they're good or not because they kind of can't until the game comes out
01:06:56 Uh, they're judging it by how how much it is is what they were hoping for in this series
01:07:01 Well, I mean if you're reviewing a game, right you're reviewing a game
01:07:05 Uh, to hopefully to someone who hasn't played it right the reader is someone who is perspective and like considering playing the game
01:07:12 What is there to talk about like like hopefully I mean there's you got to talk about something
01:07:16 They are familiar with and like relevantly that's going to be previous games by the same
01:07:21 Right, but I think like I mean you got to compare it to something and that's like a pretty good starting point
01:07:26 Saying it's one thing to say. Oh, it's kind of like bastion, but then to be like
01:07:31 Oh, it's you know, it's like bastion, but it's not quite as good and it's like this and that and
01:07:35 I just feel like it's divorcing it from being its own game
01:07:39 And and I'm making it so the developer can never make anything that's not better than bastion, you know
01:07:45 It's the same. It's we have a problem. I like the the w
01:07:49 Go on Gabe go on
01:07:52 This is why I like the the w2 wtf series
01:07:56 By total biscuit because when he talks about a game he does like at first impressions like a 30 minute video of and he just talks about
01:08:04 What what he likes and how he feels that it you know, how good it is and it's just it's it's a nice introduction to
01:08:11 like your own
01:08:14 Research into that game because he talked about transistor and he didn't mention bastion
01:08:18 And he talked about how cool all the things were and I was like, yeah, right, you know
01:08:22 I I I didn't think it was my kind of game, but
01:08:24 That's the sort of review that I prefer and I don't follow people that talk about things like
01:08:30 Like if if somebody's going to compare two games from the same developer
01:08:34 They better be making a video about the developer
01:08:37 In general instead of just reviewing the game that just came out
01:08:40 Well, there's times when it's appropriate and times when it's inappropriate. Yeah, devu was starting to bring up hiruki and maishi
01:08:45 And I'm guessing you were going to talk about kill a kill versus guru in the gond
01:08:49 Uh, yeah, of course
01:08:50 Sure, like, you know guru in the gond came out and everyone thought it was the best anime ever
01:08:53 And then when kill a kill came out all anyone talked about was how it compares to guru in the gond
01:08:58 And you can't bring it for years. You could not bring up kill a kill
01:09:01 Well, I guess it's only been out for it's been like two years two and a half years
01:09:04 But like you could not mention it without someone saying guru in the gond was better
01:09:08 And it's like it's who the fuck cares which it which it is which it is
01:09:12 But I would say it is narrowly better
01:09:14 But like I don't think it I don't think that matters like it doesn't it does not is no relevance to kill a kill
01:09:21 What guru in the gond was other than the fact that it was made by the same people
01:09:24 Do not agree that guru in the gond is necessarily better than kill a kill
01:09:30 I think that you're clearly mistaken, but go ahead and make your case
01:09:34 I think that you're a big giant faggot
01:09:35 Well, what on what basis on what basis okay, I uh guru in the gond is better. I don't know
01:09:40 I just like the uh dark souls tune. That's true
01:09:43 Well, the fact that we're even arguing about this is missing the point the point is that it doesn't matter which one's better because they're completely different shows
01:09:51 But I want to argue but it's kind of interesting but it's kind of interesting to talk about which one's better
01:09:57 But like I think I just think that when that becomes all the conversation is then it's like why can't
01:10:03 Emiishi just make another show and we judge it on its own merits and not worry about whether it is good
01:10:09 I never bring up because it's an interesting question. It's an interesting question
01:10:13 Which of these two big budget releases by the same producers is it is an interesting question?
01:10:17 But it should not do it should not dominate all discussion of kill a kill
01:10:21 Well, here's my only problem with this discussion is that I think it's vastly mistaken to consider either of them big budget
01:10:27 Or from the same producer
01:10:29 Listen, I think I do like the gond ligand kill a kill discussion more if it always involved
01:10:35 Panty and stalking as well because that really completes the picture for me
01:10:39 Right because that because I'm much more interested in Emiishi than the guy who wrote gond ligand kill a kill
01:10:45 I really resonate with his
01:10:47 Animation style. It feels like the thing that I want animation to be
01:10:53 Since I was like born and saw animation
01:10:57 Emiishi does the kind of animation that I want to exist
01:11:01 It's a similar kind of resonance to toby fox where I feel like he comes from a similar place
01:11:06 As me and that's why I mean if he comes out with another show that's going to be animated with him in charge or him directing
01:11:12 I will be hyped for it
01:11:15 Though not necessarily for whatever the narrative is and I'm almost certain I will enjoy it as a visual experience because I feel like I
01:11:23 Understand where he's coming from
01:11:28 Thank you for the creepy dramatic
01:11:30 Downward I don't know why that was just that was a very it was it was your your way of speaking was hypnotic
01:11:36 It was really quite hypnotic
01:11:38 What do you what do you guys think are we are we hitting the limits of what we can say about hype and the hype?
01:11:44 Well, we could talk about you think we could go forever
01:11:46 No, we could talk I mean at this point we are talking about arguing over shows
01:11:50 So, yeah, I don't know whether we have much to say
01:11:53 Well, I think I think it all involves hype because I think that the I think you know again
01:11:57 It's I think the problem with it is that people always want everything to constantly be amazing
01:12:04 Everyone and people expect everything to constantly be amazing
01:12:07 And I think that's the problem we're running into is that people aren't just like letting things cut like I think you should go in
01:12:13 And just like let things come to you and then make a decision, right?
01:12:17 Like sure you can know things about it beforehand and maybe set up like, you know
01:12:21 If Kyoto animations making a show I'm going to expect the characters to look a certain way
01:12:25 I'm going to expect the animation to look a certain way because I know that's what they do
01:12:29 But like that doesn't mean it's going to be good or bad or whatever
01:12:32 Like I'm just going to wait until it's there and then I'll look at it and I'll say
01:12:36 That was good or that was bad. Like I'm not going into Kill La Kill thinking this better be better than girl in the
01:12:41 Gone this better be as good as girl in the gone
01:12:43 Like, you know, then you just set up this weird expectation that has nothing to do with the intentions of the show
01:12:48 That I highly doubt anyone involved in Kill La Kill went into it saying we got a top girl in the gone
01:12:54 Hang on. I don't I don't I don't agree because I think it is fair to say I want this to be better than your past work
01:13:00 It's not saying this should be like your past work in in all these ways only done better
01:13:05 It should just be something that's it's I think it's reasonable
01:13:07 I don't think it's unfair
01:13:09 But I think it I think that it it's not like I think you're going in with your intentionality
01:13:14 Not necessarily matching what the intentions of the series are and that can be fine in the long run
01:13:20 But I feel like you should go in like like because hype is all about the beginning. It's not about what you feel in the long run
01:13:26 It's about what you feel going into it
01:13:28 And I think when you go into a show like Kill La Kill thinking this better be as good as girl in the gone
01:13:32 Or else I'm going to be disappointed then you're setting yourself up for disappointment
01:13:36 Whereas if you watch kill and you just enjoy it and then you go well
01:13:40 I didn't like it as much as girl in the gone
01:13:42 But it was a good time then like you know like that should be something you think about after the fact
01:13:46 That should be like the I agree that it's reductive
01:13:49 I agree that it's reductive and kind of nonsensical to go in with the expectation that something will be better than something because like
01:13:56 How can anything be better? How can anything be definitively better than something like okay?
01:14:00 I mean, this is just my opinion
01:14:01 But something like girl in the gun which was basically perfect at what it did like right any like
01:14:07 If something could be better than it in a certain way like if like something could be better at making you cry
01:14:12 Then girl in the gun because girl in the gun didn't do that. But like you have no soul
01:14:17 But but like um, maybe uh, I don't know
01:14:21 You told me you teared up when comedy didn't show up in the opening of the next episode. You know what you're right
01:14:25 You're right. It actually did make me cry. But other than I mean, it reaches its own top
01:14:30 Right doesn't need to be done better. And you know, yeah, or even just as well
01:14:35 Yeah, when comedy didn't when comedy didn't show up in the opening video. I think that like when he was gone
01:14:40 Like, you know, I'm a big proponent of like I think that all things I think all art can be compared
01:14:46 And I think you can select scores based on like I can look at girl in the gun and I can say that's a 10
01:14:51 And I can look at kill a kill and say that's a 9.75. That's what I would score both of them on my current scale
01:14:57 You know and like I can look at them and I can say that but like that to me should be after the fact
01:15:03 It should not be going in thinking this better be as good as girl in the gun
01:15:08 You know, it should be a consideration you make later like when you're I think I think
01:15:13 You should start judging art after you've seen the art, you know
01:15:16 Not like beforehand with the hype and like oh, this is going to be amazing or this is going to be terrible
01:15:21 This is going to be the best thing ever and then like you watch it and then you you select
01:15:26 It's like you're you're deciding how the game or the the anime or whatever compares to your hype
01:15:32 Instead of just looking at it and then making a decision about it. That's why hype is a destructive force and needs to go
01:15:38 I mean, I think that I mean, I believe in a holistic grading system
01:15:41 Like yeah, I believe that you can more or less assign a score and a value to something
01:15:45 But I don't think there's any good comes out of going in with like a rigid scoring system
01:15:50 Like oh so many points for this category so many points for that
01:15:53 It's all about just like
01:15:54 Once you've watched it and you're done and you're there and the aftermath thinking about it like how did you feel watching it?
01:16:00 What feeling did it leave you with?
01:16:02 Afterwards I and you know but on the one hand
01:16:05 I think that hype does affect that because if you went in with really high expectations and it didn't meet them
01:16:09 Then it could leave you with that sour feeling. Yeah, I score things based on the amount by the level of enjoyment that I have
01:16:16 Anything that I give a 10 is something that like I'm stewing over it
01:16:19 Well after the fact and like this it's just so good like I can yeah, but a lot of people's enjoyment is affected by
01:16:24 Randomly like see a kill lock kill picture and be like oh, yeah, and then all of a sudden I like spend an hour
01:16:29 Check off immediately and and just looking at fan art and just dwelling on checking in it and how good it is
01:16:35 Just constantly checking your and that's the kind of thing I gave a 10
01:16:37 And I recently made a list of all the games I have played that I can remember and I gave them scores if I could
01:16:43 and
01:16:44 You know undertale ended up being the only one at this moment that I gave a 10 to I gave dark souls a 9.9
01:16:51 Uh and but the fact that distinction though, what an asshole
01:16:56 The fact that I gave throw it a fucking bone
01:16:59 The fact that I gave undertale a 10 the fact that it's the highest scored one
01:17:04 Isn't nearly as interesting
01:17:06 As the fact that I gave so many 9s and the fact that there could be so many different games that could be a 9 to me
01:17:13 So many different ways of video game
01:17:15 Yeah, I think there's a 10 is vastly more interesting than what
01:17:21 That I had like is a 10 out of 10 because I hate nuance
01:17:24 Yeah, I feel like I feel like a lot of ten or zero. That's it. I feel like for a lot of viewers of stuff
01:17:29 There's like a like a zero some game. It's like everything's either a fucking 10
01:17:33 A six or four, you know, like those are the only or not even a six. I should say a seven
01:17:39 Everything's a 10 seven or four, right? It's all I've gone on record is saying that's how I view most things
01:17:44 Right, it's like either a 10. It's either the best thing ever or it's mediocre or it's shit
01:17:50 And like and and those are the three scores people would use to denote those because nobody cares about the other part of their
01:17:56 Fucking 10 scale, you know
01:17:57 But like I I I'm with devu that I like the nuance of like, you know
01:18:03 Not everything has to try to be a 10 a nine is also really interesting, you know
01:18:09 Hang on. What what is this? What is this you keep bringing up about how a show shouldn't try to be great?
01:18:14 No, I'm not saying it shouldn't try to be great. I'm saying I think anything above a seven is great
01:18:21 I think if you make a show that's an eight out of ten that gives me tons of stuff
01:18:25 And I think like, you know, if even if kill a kill is like
01:18:29 Even if you thought kill a kill was an eight and you thought guru on the gun was a 10
01:18:33 That's still incredibly impressive that it's an eight because to be an eight
01:18:36 It has to be better than 80 percent of everything else out there, you know
01:18:40 Like it's still something that has so much value
01:18:43 And it's in the parts of it that it has and I think that value is so much more interesting than why it's not a 10
01:18:50 You know, like like the things when you're like when you're like, oh guru on the gun is a 10
01:18:54 Because this is in this and kill a kill is not quite as good and it's like, yeah, that's fine and all but like
01:18:58 Look at all the stuff that is in kill a kill. That's all all great
01:19:01 And I think like it's so reductive to be like well, it's not as good as guru on the gun
01:19:05 So I don't care, you know, like I'm I'm with you on the idea that you should
01:19:09 I'm with you on the idea that you should appreciate what is good in kill a kill and just think about what is there in kill a kill to appreciate
01:19:15 I think that's cool. However, if guru on the gun like fucking
01:19:19 Emotionally like did something crazy to you and left you with an impression that lasted for years and years as it did me
01:19:24 And kill a kill didn't do that as is the case for me. Then I think it's worth asking. Okay. Well, why did that happen for?
01:19:31 Yeah, I mean, of course, that's one question you ask. I think that's worth asking
01:19:34 But I think it's I think that when we talk
01:19:38 The answer may simply be because you're older and you already felt that with guru on the gun a million years ago
01:19:45 There is that there is that I don't know. I don't think it
01:19:49 I don't think kill a kill that would have done quite the same thing
01:19:51 Well, I don't think it has the same intentions in the first place
01:19:54 So I don't think it would have done the same thing for you but like
01:19:57 But you know, I just think but that kind of I think the danger again
01:20:00 I think the danger with that again
01:20:01 I think it's cool to do that after the fact
01:20:04 After watching girl in the gun after watching kill a kill deciding how you feel and then being like
01:20:08 Kind of interesting that I didn't like that one as much as that one
01:20:10 But again, I think the problem because this is about hype was what this podcast is about is going in
01:20:15 thinking
01:20:16 This better be as good as girl in the gun or constantly comparing it or thinking about why it's not as good or why it's better
01:20:21 You know a bad place to be and on that note. I feel like we've
01:20:27 Said our piece. Yeah, let's wrap it up. Sorry. Anybody failing so much. I don't know
01:20:31 I got so busy. Hey, don't worry about it. Davoo. Stop me. Let me just end
01:20:35 Let me just end on the note that I want to say that we've talked a lot about people over hyping things in their mind
01:20:41 I think that my problem is the opposite. I really think that my
01:20:46 Hype problem is that I underhype everything and I'm skeptical of everything and I really believe that everything will suck
01:20:53 Until I see it and improve and otherwise and on the one hand
01:20:57 This does lead to me being more often pleasantly surprised when I do see something and it's not as bad as I think and it's actually pretty good
01:21:03 I'm like, oh, it's pretty good
01:21:04 But it also causes me not to seek out media and I don't watch as many movies or listen to as many music or play as many games
01:21:11 I probably should and probably would enjoy if I know what actually I just remember sometimes hype is good
01:21:15 I just remember another thing about hype that can be good
01:21:18 um
01:21:19 Because best guy ever here
01:21:22 Names his channel best guy ever
01:21:25 And all of his videos best anime ever best game ever
01:21:28 And I think that I think your channel would immediately be the worst channel on youtube
01:21:33 If you ever failed to live up to the hype of your video titles
01:21:36 It's it's hyperbole. Give me a break. Look. Okay. The thing is
01:21:41 Because I hate that I I usually hate that persona. I hate when people like say i'm the best ever
01:21:46 I think it's unless you don't even do that because the second you don't live up to it. It's well
01:21:50 It's in your name. It's inherent you've named yourself best guy ever and the second you don't live up to it
01:21:56 It's gonna look like a farce and you know
01:21:58 I I took that that girl in the gone video the first one part one
01:22:01 Yeah, I posted it up and uh, you know my friend ghost lightning who also like me and him
01:22:06 We used to always talk about how much we hated like that kind of persona and like I post on twitter
01:22:10 Like the best guy ever just made the best video ever, you know, he started watching it
01:22:14 And he was like I thought it was gonna be shit because of the the the title and everything and the way you started
01:22:19 But then of course it's a bait and switch it turns out to be like awesome
01:22:22 You know when you watch it like you deliberately made it start off shitty and then it becomes amazing, you know
01:22:27 Right, which was and if you look in my I don't know that's in the other video too at the end
01:22:32 Like I took I took painstaking ever to take as faggy a picture of myself as was possible
01:22:37 Right to show what an asshole I really am and then I hope people get that
01:22:41 But like what I what I love about it though is that the hype what it's done for you as a creator is you have to
01:22:47 Live up to best guy ever every time you cannot make a video that doesn't live up to your title
01:22:54 I mean you can make some I suppose I'm open to more criticism for that reason. I suppose that's true
01:22:58 I don't know about that. I mean, I think that what saves guys best guy ever persona is that there's a little bit of tongue in cheekness there
01:23:05 It's like kind of a good
01:23:06 It's like kind of a healthy mix of like serious hype like I am the best person
01:23:10 Yeah, but I'm also kind of I think you can figure that out in the videos when he sort of like reveals that he's a nerd
01:23:16 You know, but like and yeah, he doesn't play up the persona nearly as much as a lot of other people would
01:23:21 But I do think that if you name yourself best guy ever and I watch one of your videos
01:23:25 And I'm not interested immediately then it's going to be a bad time
01:23:33 But if some of the comedy of the video comes from him sort of poking fun at himself
01:23:37 And sort of like pulling the rug out from under his own
01:23:41 Okay, if you clicked on his video though
01:23:43 If you clicked on a best guy ever video and you didn't know who he was and you saw the name best guy ever and you clicked on it
01:23:48 And it was not an amazing video
01:23:50 Would you not then be deeply mad that he named himself? I'd probably be a little no
01:23:55 Not not if the comedy of the video came at the expense of the supposed best I guess I can agree
01:24:00 But like I think that
01:24:02 I that would make it not a bad video
01:24:04 Like I think that I think that you're already like if the fact that that's happening already makes it
01:24:10 A good video
01:24:11 I'm saying if the video was not good if it didn't have that and the guy was called best guy ever
01:24:16 Would you not then be that much more mad like if someone made it if someone made a video and they're called best guy ever
01:24:21 And they started out the video like I'm amazing
01:24:24 I'm the coolest and then their analysis was completely like not interesting
01:24:28 Would you not be that much more mad that he called himself that I'm really interested in and I really want to talk about this
01:24:33 It's the how a creator can manage the hype levels of their stuff and that's very interesting to me
01:24:39 I know we were trying to end this podcast
01:24:41 But that is its own interesting topic that I like to do in my own videos when I did my
01:24:45 Willa Cooster tycoon one versus three video was this huge production and I'm like
01:24:49 I don't want people to get hyped up to think I'm always going to be this big
01:24:53 So right afterwards I did a two minute video about trampolines
01:24:57 And later on I was doing this I did this 20 minute critique of big hero six
01:25:02 I did this 35 minute break down
01:25:04 You did these things not because you super
01:25:07 Wanted to talk about these topics immediately
01:25:09 But as a as an effect to bring down the expectations of the audience. Yeah, and I was making I made a well
01:25:15 That's part of it. Like I made a 20 minute video
01:25:17 I made a 35 minute video. So then I made a seven minute video
01:25:21 And so like my idea is to like to kind of dress people down from their high
01:25:27 Like sometimes that's a pretty good idea if I'm really into like really intricate really deep music
01:25:32 And I'm on this big kick. I'll like listen to some really stupid mucor stuff that like lowers my class
01:25:40 Brings me back. I I kind of do this
01:25:43 Mucor is not low class
01:25:44 I I do the same thing as devu where I try to manage expectations a lot and like especially when I first started doing anime videos
01:25:50 Like I tried to get out as many videos as possible so that people would get like
01:25:56 Like I didn't want people to think that I'm only into this type of show or that like if I only talked about sci-fi shows
01:26:01 I didn't want people to think I was a sci-fi channel
01:26:03 I didn't want people to think I was like, you know only gonna make big videos or small videos
01:26:07 So I tried to mix it up and have like every video
01:26:09 I did be something different from the last and make it like, you know
01:26:12 And now I'm at a point where I can do anything
01:26:15 I could just make nothing but big videos
01:26:16 But people would know that I could change it, you know, like people wouldn't expect it to all be that
01:26:22 Whereas I think like I think mr. Plinkett videos for instance because he set the bar
01:26:27 Said they were always going to be big and I think that's why there haven't been anymore because like always
01:26:31 Beg them for Plinkett videos. That's what people really want a couple of smaller ones
01:26:35 But no one like, you know, everyone complained about yeah because they were small
01:26:39 And so like he could never make Plinkett a video series
01:26:41 I could do everything because so many of them were big so early
01:26:45 But even with stuff like Plinkett like managing expectations
01:26:48 Happens in the script where like he'd used that voice
01:26:52 Specifically because it was boring to listen to someone talk about that kind of shit and it's just too nerdy
01:26:57 So he wanted to make it something that you would expect like you go in and you're like
01:27:01 What the hell is this, you know, and then it's like then you pay more attention to the points
01:27:04 Which is why you know like film crit hulk does his all caps thing
01:27:08 Which I don't think is as effective
01:27:09 But like I get that he's doing it so that people think it's stupid and then they read it and they don't think it's pretentious
01:27:14 You know, I don't think it works when I do it. I make a video about undertale
01:27:18 I'm going to tell everyone to rip it off and then everyone took it literally and then mr. Beetsong like
01:27:24 Is the expert of this where he always like he'll he'll he'll like the biggest difference between like the truth is
01:27:29 I'm engaging in calculated sophistry for the sake of
01:27:33 The difference between Beetsong and and errant signal, for instance
01:27:36 Is errant signal will pull out some huge word out of his ass and just run with it
01:27:41 And you're just like what the fuck are you talking about where Beetsong will be like
01:27:44 I'm about to make up a really stupid word and I'm a complete idiot
01:27:48 Here it is. If you're interested then keep watching, you know, like he downplays
01:27:53 What he's doing so that you don't think
01:27:55 While this pretentious fuck like you do when you watch errant signal videos, you know
01:27:59 If I were in toby fox's position because I I wish I have even
01:28:03 Like named him on twitter with the at symbol to like hope he reads this because this is my advice to him
01:28:08 Because he has probably enough money to live for a couple of years without publishing anything for sale
01:28:13 Make a bunch of really short
01:28:16 Little games about random things that are off the top of your head
01:28:20 That way people who are fans of you can think of you not as the undertale god, but as
01:28:27 This guy who comes out with shit
01:28:29 You know, I don't think there's any way of avoiding him being undertale man for the duration
01:28:34 I like that idea to do. I think that's a good advice
01:28:36 It was greatly diminish it would give him this fan base of people who follow his stuff
01:28:41 Not when will be the second coming of toby, right?
01:28:45 Because that way when it's time like say in three years to make his next big game
01:28:50 It'll cost especially if it does take three years because by then people will will have like, you know
01:28:56 Any time I think the I think people build up in their heads when something doesn't come out for a long time
01:29:02 It automatically means that all the time was dedicated to it, you know, like for instance, uh, the band agilosh
01:29:09 Agilosh only puts out an album every four years and like their first four albums were all like incredible
01:29:15 So it always felt like man, they really ruminate on this stuff for four fucking years
01:29:20 And then they put out their fifth album and it was kind of like mediocre
01:29:22 And it was like, you know, the the first impression you get is did they really spend four years on this?
01:29:27 But then you think about it and it's probably more like they were just doing normal shit for three years and then decided
01:29:32 They wanted to do like I don't think that they're professional musicians
01:29:35 Like I don't think they have enough fans that or put out enough content that they get paid just for that
01:29:41 It's probably a side job. They probably have normal fucking jobs, you know
01:29:44 So like yeah
01:29:46 So I can't help but imagine that it's really more like every four years they go
01:29:49 Hey, what if we put out another album? That would be fun, you know, but like to the fans
01:29:53 It's like, oh my god four years of waiting has finally paid off
01:29:57 You know, this this has to live up to those four years of expectations and you know, and then you get middle year solid five and
01:30:04 Yeah, what a what a disaster which was like what like eight years seven years something like
01:30:10 Well, well, wait years hands are on came out in that time too. So that's you know, there was something there
01:30:15 Yeah, red line. Well red line was awesome and red line wasn't even was red was were people super hyped
01:30:21 No, no one knew and no one watched it once it came out. It was totally later on like it was completely
01:30:28 Did not sell no one cared about it and madhouse went bankrupt and
01:30:34 Okay, but but I guess at least it's become kind of a cult hit now, right?
01:30:38 I guess you can call it but I still don't think it's as big as it should be
01:30:41 It's actually it's on youtube now for free. Anyone can watch it. Yeah, like uh fucking. Oh, shit
01:30:48 Maybe I should go buy it on dvd. Yeah, dude the dvds lately. I've been lately
01:30:52 I've been really feeling the urge to buy things that I like I went back and I bought I bought a
01:30:58 Highlyx that claymation game because it was only three dollars and I thought he deserved three dollars
01:31:02 I went and bought lisa for a friend because I really wanted to spend more than the three dollars
01:31:06 I spent have you come into some great wealth that is prompted such uh such kindness
01:31:12 Medline blue rays were seven dollars within like a year
01:31:15 Like they immediately were on sale like one dollar for each year that it was there
01:31:20 You know, let's look talk about talk about not having hype when I saw a red line
01:31:25 I didn't know what the fuck was gonna happen. It was like the best movie I've ever seen. It was so fucking good
01:31:30 I'm so glad that we've all hyped the shit out of red line
01:31:33 Everyone listening should go watch it with totally high expectations
01:31:37 Expect it to be the greatest movie ever
01:31:39 Which incidentally if you go one of those expectations, you will be let down because the plot is not that interesting
01:31:46 It's just a really cool movie
01:31:48 It's it's but that that comes right back to the problem with like managing hype
01:31:52 We're like it's so hard to talk about red line because your instinct to talk about it is
01:31:57 It's so mind-blowing that you're like this is the greatest thing ever
01:32:00 But then you actually watch it without hyping it. I don't think it's anyone's favorite movie
01:32:05 But it's something that I think everyone should see and I think that's a problem
01:32:08 When you say something like everyone should see this movie then they're like, oh, it must be the best ever
01:32:12 And it's like well, it doesn't like the bestness is not what makes it worthwhile
01:32:17 It's the intrigue of seeing that this is real that like this is the thing that happened
01:32:21 You know, it's fascinated on like a cultural level that it exists that was produced
01:32:25 That's too to go to go back to the thing about how I underhyped things in my head
01:32:31 And how
01:32:32 A having hype is bad and it makes me like things less and going back to undertale too
01:32:37 Let me draw all these threads and please wrap it up this time to go. I gotta and tell the story if I played the demo
01:32:43 I loved the demo. I was like, I'm really excited for this game
01:32:46 But due to my proclivities in my head. I'm like, okay, that demo was really good. He probably used all his good ideas for the demo
01:32:53 The rest. Yeah, the rest of the game will probably not be as consistently good
01:32:58 So I actually kind of dehyped myself for the rest of the game didn't expect to like as much
01:33:02 Then went in
01:33:03 Found that the game continued to get better and better and all had all these other great ideas in it
01:33:07 And ended up being like, hmm, you know what? It actually was pretty consistent in quality
01:33:12 It didn't it didn't blow me away. It wasn't better than the demo
01:33:14 But it was all I'd say all of it was consistently as good as the demo
01:33:18 So my expectations and the reality ended up it ended up being like a very
01:33:22 Fortuitous like they came into alignment in a way that it all really fucking worked out just just beachy for me
01:33:28 So that was a very rare case. That's the thing. That's didn't end up
01:33:32 But it was because
01:33:33 But it was because I was managing my expectations in that way because of my skepticism
01:33:38 The hype didn't end up hurting. Well, that's good. Okay
01:33:41 Good anecdotes. Everyone. Good talk. We're done. Oh
01:33:45 I'm glad. Yes. Thanks jester for that contribution. Uh, we're uh, thanks for watching guys
01:33:50 We'll be back next week. Leave your comments in the thing below if you got any more suggestions for topics you want us to cover
