00:00:00 Rise and shine gamers and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:09 I, as you know, am the best morning boy and we've got Ben Saint.
00:00:14 Who?
00:00:15 I, I, I, that's a name I haven't heard in years, Vapes.
00:00:22 We've got Tom Oliver.
00:00:23 I'm the worst morning boy because the mornings are shit.
00:00:28 It's all about hardcore nighttime nocturnal power.
00:00:31 Guys, it's 1pm and it's, it's not the morning and second of all, Tom, you're wrong because
00:00:39 time zones just changed.
00:00:41 That thing happened or and what's what happens when the clock, the clock, yeah, and now it
00:00:47 gets dark at like 4pm.
00:00:49 It's dark for like 18 hours of the day now.
00:00:52 Right.
00:00:53 I'm in my element.
00:00:54 Far longer.
00:00:55 Oh, you know, it's too much.
00:00:57 Let's get back to this.
00:00:58 That's a good topic, but also Mages here.
00:01:00 Hello.
00:01:01 Hello.
00:01:02 Hello.
00:01:03 I hate the cold.
00:01:04 Speaking of time zones.
00:01:05 Yeah.
00:01:06 I hate the cold.
00:01:07 That we all agree on, I hope.
00:01:08 I, I do like coats.
00:01:09 I do like winter coats.
00:01:10 Oh, God.
00:01:11 Ben, your politics are one thing, but liking the cold is, is something I cannot stand
00:01:18 for.
00:01:19 No, no, I don't, I don't, I don't like the cold.
00:01:20 I don't like the cold, but I do like wearing big coats.
00:01:24 Well, surely we could all agree that being inside, while there's perhaps a layer of snow
00:01:28 and it's lightly snowing, but you're warm inside with a blanket and perhaps a cup of
00:01:32 warm beverage can be a very enjoyable experience.
00:01:37 It's the juxtaposition you see, the, the, the contradiction in terms that leads to ultimate
00:01:43 pleasure.
00:01:44 As you cast your gaze outside at the fucking broken homeless freezing and you in your gated
00:01:51 castle.
00:01:52 It just makes me feel great.
00:01:53 Yes.
00:01:54 It just makes her plus capital.
00:01:55 It just makes me feel so warm and happy inside.
00:01:58 Nate, I, I went to the parents place for Thanksgiving and was it nice?
00:02:05 Everyone have a good time?
00:02:06 It was fine.
00:02:07 It was good.
00:02:08 And, and they, mom was like here, you know, he got some stuff and here's, you know, Nate
00:02:15 said he didn't want this and it was, he was like a black.
00:02:19 It wasn't my shoes was it?
00:02:20 She's not giving away more shoes.
00:02:21 No, it was like a black coat with like a furry hood.
00:02:24 Okay.
00:02:25 All right.
00:02:26 Okay.
00:02:27 You know what?
00:02:28 This is a perfect example of what happened with the shoes because when I spoke to mom,
00:02:31 I remember this explicitly.
00:02:33 I said, when I come to visit at Christmas, I will decide whether it fits or not.
00:02:41 If it doesn't fit, mom, I told her this, then we will decide about what to do with it.
00:02:46 She told me it didn't fit.
00:02:47 She was like here.
00:02:48 She is a fucking liar.
00:02:49 She was like Nate said, she said, Nate said this doesn't fit.
00:02:53 It didn't fit him anymore.
00:02:54 Do you want it?
00:02:55 And I was like, I guess.
00:02:56 Yeah.
00:02:57 Okay.
00:02:58 There's, there's some confusion going on in mom's head as usual, I guess, because we
00:03:01 just spoke about this.
00:03:02 I get why it was undermined.
00:03:04 I said, I suspect it doesn't fit, but I will try it on when I'm there in like 25 days,
00:03:10 mom, for Christmas.
00:03:12 Don't give it away until then.
00:03:14 I like that coat.
00:03:15 It may be too small, but I guess I'll find if it fits Ben, it probably fits me.
00:03:20 So there you go, mom.
00:03:22 The fuck.
00:03:23 This is exactly what happened with the shoes.
00:03:25 I have no doubt this confirms it in my mind.
00:03:27 Mom is just looking to fuck me over as many ways as possible.
00:03:31 Yes.
00:03:32 Absolutely.
00:03:33 You see what she's trying to do?
00:03:34 She's trying to force me to take drastic action.
00:03:37 That woman's vindictive.
00:03:38 There's no doubt in my mind.
00:03:40 Well, this Christmas, she's going to get the gift of a lifetime.
00:03:43 This is going to be prisoner Christmas.
00:03:46 Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.
00:03:53 Yeah, that's how I feel right now.
00:03:57 I'm thinking of buying a tree, though.
00:03:59 I think of buying a tree for the apart.
00:04:00 Like a little small, fake tree.
00:04:01 We can be allowed.
00:04:02 I just want to look at it and feel happy, you know, Christmas spirit.
00:04:06 I hate feeling happy.
00:04:08 I see. I see in the in the stores, like these little tiny potted, fake Christmas
00:04:13 trees, I was like, maybe, maybe this year will be the year I'll get a little tiny
00:04:17 tree. Why not?
00:04:18 Just, just, just it makes me happy.
00:04:21 I agree.
00:04:22 That's the whole point.
00:04:23 That's what these things are supposed to do.
00:04:25 And I don't know, out here, being on our own, out here, not live on their
00:04:28 families anymore, there's none of this like group family camaraderie or spirit.
00:04:32 Like when you're, when you're like in school and like everyone around you is
00:04:35 talking about it and like all the teachers and all the events are like, you
00:04:38 know, holiday oriented, it really instills that spirit in you.
00:04:41 But once you're on your own, you kind of got to, you got to force yourself
00:04:44 into that mindset.
00:04:45 And I think that it's, it's well worth the slight amount of effort and money.
00:04:50 It just, it gives you a stat buff of happiness temporarily.
00:04:53 I love Christmas just because like, uh, yeah, winter is so dreary and depressing
00:04:58 and sad and dark and cold.
00:05:00 But then like, well, well, Christmas comes around, uh, or just before like a
00:05:04 month or two before Christmas rolls around, uh, everything, all the stores
00:05:08 and people sometimes like decorate and shiny, sparkly, glittery things.
00:05:12 And it's like, oh, it looks so nice and bright and cheerful and colorful.
00:05:16 And I like it.
00:05:17 It's like after New Year's ends though, everything just goes so dark and it's
00:05:21 sad when like real winter begins.
00:05:24 Like I never feel that cold in December because of these things, I think, but
00:05:28 in January, that's when hell has begun.
00:05:30 I think January and February are technically the cold this month just
00:05:33 because of how we are rotates.
00:05:35 It's because you have something to look forward to.
00:05:37 So you ignore the cold, but as soon as it's all over, you're like, wait a minute,
00:05:40 this fucking sucks.
00:05:43 And I guess, I mean, what's the next like holiday?
00:05:46 Easter?
00:05:46 Valentine's Day, I guess.
00:05:47 I mean, yeah, Easter, I suppose.
00:05:49 Boring love and God.
00:05:51 No, thanks.
00:05:52 I don't believe in either of those, sir.
00:05:55 So speaking of holidays, did you buy anything for the Black Friday sales and stuff?
00:06:01 I totally skipped it.
00:06:02 I don't give a shit.
00:06:03 Oh, you know, tomorrow's Cyber Monday, though.
00:06:05 So I probably will just, you know, do the easy thing and go to Amazon.
00:06:09 I need it.
00:06:09 It's like the online equivalent of Black Friday.
00:06:12 I need a fucking cord for my charger, my mobile charger that I got for Pokemon Go.
00:06:17 I bought a fucking good cord to charge my phone and then it disappeared like a week later.
00:06:24 I was like, I'm going to still like, I finally, I finally committed to accepting
00:06:30 that all my previous chords had been lost and I would never find them again.
00:06:34 I swallowed my pride.
00:06:35 I bought a new one and then it was gone.
00:06:38 I almost bought something for Black Friday, but I was I was
00:06:41 bamboozled.
00:06:42 I wanted I wanted to get a new power supply for my for the streaming computer
00:06:45 because I'm getting a new streaming setup to do more I am game streams.
00:06:48 And I was like, this power supply is shit.
00:06:50 I don't want this computer running 24 seven with like a budget power supply
00:06:54 that came from like some crazy Chinese case I got like 10 years ago.
00:06:57 It'll probably explode.
00:06:58 So I found a sick power supply like on sale.
00:07:00 I was like, oh, dope.
00:07:01 I'm buying this sick.
00:07:03 Good Black Friday went to grab my debit card, came back downstairs, sale over.
00:07:08 I'm like, what the fuck?
00:07:10 It's 1230.
00:07:11 What the fuck?
00:07:12 It's still there.
00:07:13 It's not out of stock.
00:07:14 It's just now three times as expensive for some reason in like the 20 seconds
00:07:19 between I'm going to buy that and man, dude, the worst.
00:07:23 So fuck you, new egg, you piece of shit.
00:07:26 You lost the sale.
00:07:27 Trust muncher.
00:07:28 I bought like two games.
00:07:30 That reminds me it's on Thanksgiving.
00:07:33 We give thanks for things that we appreciate right now.
00:07:35 I thought of something that I'm thankful for and I'm thankful
00:07:39 for the continual movement I'm seeing towards this.
00:07:42 I believe it's called, do we call it the Type C charger?
00:07:45 USB Type C.
00:07:46 Yeah, USB.
00:07:47 Yes.
00:07:47 This, the fact that the whole world, it's the oval.
00:07:52 Yeah.
00:07:52 It's the one that's reversible.
00:07:53 Yeah.
00:07:53 And it works on both sides.
00:07:55 It's reversible.
00:07:56 The fact that we're getting this technology, look, the round ones were shit.
00:07:59 Type C, this is the way to go.
00:08:01 The fact that it's becoming more and more universally adopted
00:08:04 in things brings me such joy.
00:08:06 And once we just all are using one type of board, I don't like it
00:08:09 because my phone doesn't take it.
00:08:11 Well, OK, we'll get a new phone, Ben, 10 years.
00:08:13 And we'll all, well, the sick thing about USB Type C is the dope.
00:08:18 The dopest thing about Type C is it's not even just like phone connectors.
00:08:21 Type C does everything.
00:08:22 It does display how it does USB.
00:08:25 So like, assumedly, like 10 years from now, literally, you'll just go
00:08:30 like on your computer and it'll just be Type C, everything
00:08:32 because every port will do anything you want it to.
00:08:35 Oh, fantastic.
00:08:35 Well, yeah, it's exactly what we should be doing.
00:08:37 We'll all be like birds with just one hole that does everything.
00:08:42 Oh, yeah.
00:08:44 I look forward to our avian future.
00:08:47 But yeah.
00:08:48 Simple, efficient, elegant.
00:08:51 The cloaca.
00:08:52 Speaking of speaking of things that are literally lighter than air, such as birds,
00:08:56 I wanted to give everyone a life update on a little beast named Lord Sashomaru.
00:09:02 And it's that everyone's been mocking Sashomaru, been talking shit
00:09:05 about how fat my dog is.
00:09:07 So you're fine.
00:09:07 You starved him for months and now he's skin and bones.
00:09:10 He's been on a little diet toe and he has in fact lost three pounds.
00:09:15 He went from 28 pounds to 25 pounds.
00:09:18 And that's a hell of a loss.
00:09:20 That's like over 10 percent.
00:09:21 That's pretty good.
00:09:22 I took a sword.
00:09:23 I just cleaved his fucking head off.
00:09:25 Just instantly, three pounds were gone.
00:09:27 Just cut his tail off.
00:09:28 You know, that was like two pounds of extra weight that he didn't need.
00:09:30 Now it's gone.
00:09:32 But even after losing the weight, the thing is he I was I'm vindicated
00:09:36 because he looks exactly the same.
00:09:38 He's just got a weird corgi body and it's not his fault that he's big
00:09:42 boned and wide and a strange creature that no one will ever love.
00:09:45 Oh, you know, that's the same curse I have.
00:09:47 No matter how much weight I lose, I still am somehow still fat.
00:09:51 It just doesn't matter.
00:09:52 It just comes from mystery areas.
00:09:54 I don't I look to say I've lost like 10 pounds.
00:09:56 I look fucking exactly the same.
00:09:57 But, you know, Sessha was at like a doggy daycare thing.
00:10:01 We were just like testing a new one because when we go to Christmas,
00:10:04 he's got to stay at a daycare place and there is a what we call the Beagle Brigade.
00:10:10 There's just a squad of Beagles and Sessha is half Beagle.
00:10:14 So, you know, the Beagle Brigade now that the Beagle Brigade, to be fair,
00:10:17 is somewhat exclusive.
00:10:18 They don't just let any Beagle join their ranks.
00:10:21 You have to be up to a certain snuff.
00:10:22 But when Sessha attempted to ooze his way into their ranks, as he does,
00:10:27 there was an immediate harsh rejection of flagrant racism.
00:10:31 Flagrant, you know, this is like the canine equivalent of like a half elf
00:10:35 just sparred by both by both fucking cultures.
00:10:39 He has nowhere to be. Exactly.
00:10:40 It's it's deeply fucked up and it's it's unacceptable.
00:10:44 It sounds like some shonen protag material.
00:10:46 He can rise above the the spurs of his peers
00:10:49 and unite the races once and for all.
00:10:52 I, you know, I can't get down with this multiracial interbreeding bullshit,
00:10:56 though, because I mean, they told us over and over again
00:10:59 that human Saiyan hybrids were quote unquote better than pure blood
00:11:04 Saiyans in Dragon Ball Z.
00:11:07 Why did Gohan lose every fight he ever fought in, except the one during
00:11:11 the Cell Saga that obviously was cheating?
00:11:13 The only one that the ghost of Goku won.
00:11:15 Yeah, he needed the ghost of a pure Saiyan to help him out.
00:11:18 That's exactly right.
00:11:21 So, you know, you're I don't know,
00:11:23 Future Trunks was a badass like through and through a hundred percent.
00:11:28 You're not wrong.
00:11:29 I mean, I mean, is anyone more badass than Trunks
00:11:32 when he like fucking trains hardcore, goes back to his timeline
00:11:35 and just immediately mercs everybody, even though he knows
00:11:37 that these androids could be like good people deep down.
00:11:40 But no, it's immediately murders regardless.
00:11:43 No consideration about this fucking incredible down.
00:11:48 You touch on the larger question of what is morality?
00:11:50 Sure, sure, sure, sure, you know, different timelines.
00:11:53 But I'm just saying if I was in that if I was in that situation,
00:11:57 I would have a little like maybe like seven seconds of pause.
00:12:00 Our boy Trunks, zero.
00:12:02 No, just immediately murdered, like taking great joy in doing so.
00:12:07 And then tracks down Cell, mocks him and then immediately kills him.
00:12:11 Greatest, greatest character ever.
00:12:13 Just to find goodness as not vulnerable to the tip of my sword.
00:12:18 Indeed, you're done.
00:12:19 Speaking of which, did you guys ever watch like the Future Trunks
00:12:23 there had like his own saga in Dragon Ball Super
00:12:26 that they tell me is like the best one in Dragon Ball Super?
00:12:28 Does anybody go watch that?
00:12:30 I've seen like one episode of Dragon Ball Super.
00:12:33 And I saw one clip from the Super with like with where
00:12:38 Mr. Satan sort of punches Goku, but not really.
00:12:41 And Goku's like, oh, no, I'm falling.
00:12:43 I forgot my tractor.
00:12:44 I got my tractor. Yeah, that was making the rounds on Twitter.
00:12:48 Yep, that's the only thing I saw.
00:12:50 I mean, I just I just referred to the God of Dragon Ball
00:12:53 that I know Jax played on Twitter.
00:12:55 And he's always saying that Super is garbage
00:12:57 except for the slice of life stuff.
00:12:58 So I just take his word for it.
00:13:00 Yeah, you know, just out of curiosity,
00:13:01 is Jax a fan of like Dragon Ball Classic?
00:13:03 Yes, that's the mark of like a true.
00:13:05 He's he's he's on record, I believe, saying that it is better than Z.
00:13:10 It's better than. Oh, my God, that's unusual.
00:13:12 But OK, I mean, I agree.
00:13:14 I think original Dragon Ball is better than Z as well.
00:13:16 So I mean, it's got to be more.
00:13:19 It's just, I mean, have you seen it as a classic, obviously,
00:13:22 but there's tons of bullshit that we've all just kind of accepted and moved past
00:13:24 have you watched Dragon Ball? It's definitely there.
00:13:27 I've you know, I've read the manga up to, like, I don't know.
00:13:31 I remember I think right when like he started to fight that guy,
00:13:34 he throws logs, lousy and like stands on him or whatever,
00:13:37 which is where things get really crunk, as I recall.
00:13:39 I just gave up of speaking of reading manga.
00:13:43 I started reading one piece again.
00:13:45 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm up to
00:13:48 actually, it's been this is like last week I did, but I'm up to chapter eight,
00:13:52 fifty five. What's happening?
00:13:54 Jesus, we are at.
00:13:57 Oh, fuck, they.
00:13:59 Well, it would be kind of spoilery to say, but they are.
00:14:03 I mean, you're in the so you're in Big Mom Ark, I assume.
00:14:05 Yeah, I'm pretty well into Big Mom Ark.
00:14:09 The girl, she's putting putting.
00:14:12 Yeah, we saw putting's thing.
00:14:15 You know, OK, I believe I do know.
00:14:18 The things you were saying, yes, he understood.
00:14:21 OK, that's cool. That's cool.
00:14:22 Well, great. It's really cool.
00:14:24 It's great. It is great.
00:14:26 And perhaps this, the the Whole Cake Island Ark is is is quite
00:14:30 luscious and delicious and excellent overall.
00:14:33 I'm happy to say.
00:14:34 And if you get caught up, hey, maybe this legendary appearance
00:14:37 on the Padi cast could happen.
00:14:39 Yeah, what is what chapter is as one piece at currently?
00:14:42 Like how is it nine hundred something, right?
00:14:44 Oh, you're right around nine hundred sixty five or so.
00:14:47 So he's got a hundred chapters together.
00:14:49 I like I like how you have like barely any you're almost caught up
00:14:54 with a hundred something chapters.
00:14:55 Meanwhile, I'm reading more than most stars,
00:14:57 which is like a hundred and fifty chapters in total.
00:15:00 Yeah, I read like a hundred and I read like a hundred and twenty
00:15:04 chapters the other day. And oh, there you go.
00:15:07 Yeah, it's pretty good.
00:15:09 I wasn't doing anything.
00:15:11 Yeah, that's cool.
00:15:11 Did you read through all of zoe in doing that zoe?
00:15:14 Wait, on the island on the big elephants, man.
00:15:18 Yes. Yes.
00:15:19 He's got to love that arc, man.
00:15:21 Oh, the fucking rhizo arc with the manker.
00:15:23 Oh, my God, it's one of my favorite moments in the whole fucking series.
00:15:28 Oh, wait, they still have carrot.
00:15:29 Carrot is still around from everyone's favorite character.
00:15:33 Fucking carrot. Oh, she's going to join the crew.
00:15:35 I mean, she is pretty cute.
00:15:37 She's not going to.
00:15:38 She doesn't seem only positive quality.
00:15:40 Yeah, yeah. I mean, you're right, of course.
00:15:43 She's literally like the female chopper.
00:15:45 Chopper has done nothing for a thousand chapters like the female chopper.
00:15:48 Even though there is literally a female chopper, there's like a reindeer nurse lady.
00:15:52 Oh, yeah. But that's not the female chopper.
00:15:54 Carrot is a female chopper.
00:15:57 You know, I'll just we'll move on from one piece, guys, I promise.
00:16:00 But I just want to say that on the subject of chopper,
00:16:02 chopper is the one piece member who has been the most forgotten as a real
00:16:06 character by a huge margin.
00:16:09 I mean, guys like Brooke get some stupendous moments
00:16:12 in at various times, Frankie once in a while gets a little cool flight
00:16:15 and dress Rosa, but chopper, nothing, absolutely nothing.
00:16:20 But there there is a great opportunity.
00:16:22 Wano is kind of like the Zoan Ark and chopper is the Zoan guy on the crew
00:16:28 and the fucking monster balls or the rumble balls are like a unique thing
00:16:32 that tie into like Zoan powers.
00:16:34 If Odit doesn't capitalize on that, I will be so deeply disappointed,
00:16:38 but I have almost no faith that anything interesting will be done with
00:16:42 chopper ever again until the end of the series.
00:16:44 There's just too many characters.
00:16:45 I just say I still I still like Jinbei that much.
00:16:50 Oh, brother, you're preaching the choir over here, man.
00:16:52 I'm just not I'm just not that interested in Jinbei.
00:16:54 I'm not that interested.
00:16:55 I'm not I'm not interested in law.
00:16:58 Like it's just all the right things, Ben.
00:17:00 You're doing it well.
00:17:02 It's just that I feel like Oda made a really makes a really big deal out
00:17:05 of like Jinbei coming back and I'm just like, yeah, OK, all right.
00:17:10 You know, it's a funny thing because when you realistically think about it,
00:17:13 Jinbei has done some truly stupendous things to help the straw hats.
00:17:17 Like he's saved Luffy at Marine for it.
00:17:20 He did that. He joined the rebellion like to leave the jail.
00:17:24 Well, so did a bond.
00:17:25 Like a fishman.
00:17:25 So did bond Clay.
00:17:27 Nobody's going wild about bond Clay over here.
00:17:31 Yes, I had to look up here because I wanted to see how cute she is.
00:17:34 And I like this form of her.
00:17:36 It's in the gross discussing.
00:17:37 Oh, it's going to be a spoiler.
00:17:38 Don't show Ben. Don't show Ben.
00:17:40 Oh, OK.
00:17:41 Sorry, I'm not reading it so I'll check it out.
00:17:45 I mean, you know, I don't care.
00:17:46 I'm looking. I'm fucking looking.
00:17:48 Oh, shit.
00:17:50 Wait, is that?
00:17:51 Is that real?
00:17:53 Yeah, I mean, that's it's a thing that happens.
00:17:55 Well, it's a that is a whole thing made for it.
00:17:58 Oh, yeah, you're not.
00:18:00 You're not wrong.
00:18:00 Is that does she either rumble ball and that happens?
00:18:03 No, I mean, it's all the minks have this thing that under a full moon,
00:18:07 they turn to the Zulong, which is actually exactly like Goku from Dragon Ball.
00:18:10 He also becomes the Zulong Monkey Man form.
00:18:13 They just go like super powerful.
00:18:14 I don't feel like I've ruined anything by knowing that.
00:18:17 Yeah, there's it's yeah.
00:18:20 She just gets extra fluffy and I like it.
00:18:22 And she basically goes into mega Ampharos form.
00:18:25 Yes, that. Yes, yes.
00:18:29 Anyway, one piece is wicked cool.
00:18:31 Indeed, indeed.
00:18:32 For all those haters out there, for all the bullies who tell me, like,
00:18:35 no, Nate, you know, law is cool.
00:18:37 Gene Bay is cool.
00:18:38 I just want to point out to the record.
00:18:39 Here's a guy who just got cut up and feels very similar to me.
00:18:42 I'm not a crazy person.
00:18:44 The one thing about my fucking mind here that I like, like, laws fine.
00:18:50 He he's not he has not doing very much these days.
00:18:52 Like, he'll just kind of like, yeah, his over.
00:18:55 Yeah, he'll just kind of be standing behind Luffy and like make a comment here
00:18:58 and there and like, that's cool.
00:19:00 That's fine.
00:19:01 When the fights are like about him, his power is not interesting.
00:19:04 His power is dumb.
00:19:06 I mean, it's it's complicated.
00:19:08 It's kind of cool.
00:19:09 There's kind of like Robin's power.
00:19:10 It's a little too open ended.
00:19:12 I don't think it's fun shown in fights.
00:19:14 Yeah. Yeah.
00:19:15 Yeah, exactly.
00:19:16 Yeah, right.
00:19:18 And, you know, the only thing I'll say is that I definitely agree with you.
00:19:21 And I I really feel the guys like, like, I mean, Ace is dead,
00:19:25 but like to a degree like Ace,
00:19:26 Ace actually has his own bunch of like side novels
00:19:29 that they're writing about Ace specifically in his adventures.
00:19:32 I mean, sounds fine.
00:19:33 But we know how that journey ends.
00:19:35 So how interesting could they really be?
00:19:37 Well, I mean, hey, I know it's about the adventure,
00:19:39 not the destination, blah, blah, blah.
00:19:41 Hey, question.
00:19:42 Do you think do you think that Marco the Phoenix could hurt Ace?
00:19:47 I think yes, because if Magma could hurt Ace's fire because it's hotter.
00:19:53 Marco's Phoenix fire has to be hotter than Ace's regular fire, right?
00:19:58 It is explicitly stated somewhere
00:20:00 that Marco's flames actually do not produce heat.
00:20:03 They're a magical, special kind of fire
00:20:05 that is totally unique and distinct from normal fire.
00:20:08 Never mind.
00:20:09 Never fucking mind.
00:20:11 It's that's that's what it is.
00:20:13 I don't fucking know.
00:20:14 Excellent.
00:20:14 Oh, and I was just going to say that I feel like characters
00:20:16 like like law are literally like only consistently in the narrative still.
00:20:22 Like, we all know that it was part of his plot,
00:20:24 like fight kind of so it makes sense.
00:20:25 He's involved, but he doesn't have to be on screen,
00:20:27 except that he places so unbelievably high in the character poll rankings
00:20:32 that it's almost it'd be like it'd be a bad move to not continually have him there.
00:20:37 And I really feel that drives why he takes up the screen time he does to.
00:20:42 What? I mean, I feel I like what it is.
00:20:45 Oda will basically just have him like sort of looking grumpy
00:20:48 and like saying something kind of like annoyed lately.
00:20:51 And like, I think that's fine and good.
00:20:53 And it is what he should be doing.
00:20:56 Well, you know, to like Kinemon was with the boys for a long time.
00:20:59 And I like never got annoyed by Kinemon.
00:21:01 I just would be like, I mean, what's this guy do?
00:21:03 When's he going to get his thing?
00:21:04 And he finally has in Wano.
00:21:06 So like, that's cool.
00:21:07 But last to say about all these things.
00:21:10 Go listen to the putty cast. Good stuff. Good stuff.
00:21:16 Boy, I have a question.
00:21:20 Sure. Have you guys like seen any discourse about Naruto,
00:21:24 like Sakura versus Hinata and stuff on your Twitter?
00:21:26 Because I've seen loads of it.
00:21:29 Not particularly.
00:21:30 No, I think it comes from one source, particularly.
00:21:32 But like, they're very.
00:21:33 Is this Boruto related or classic Naruto?
00:21:36 And just in general, I think it might span the whole
00:21:40 Naruto verse or whatever.
00:21:42 People still hate Sakura and but they like Hinata apparently
00:21:46 for the same things they hate Sakura for.
00:21:49 Or at least that's the claim people.
00:21:50 They hate Hinata. Who hates Hinata?
00:21:52 No, no, no. She said they like Hinata.
00:21:54 They don't like Sakura.
00:21:55 Yeah. But like, people who like Sakura just as a backlash
00:22:00 start hating on Hinata just because people don't hate Hinata.
00:22:04 And it's just such a weird stupid mess.
00:22:07 Do you have any feelings on either of the characters?
00:22:11 I'm interested to hear.
00:22:13 I mean, no, nothing, nothing much, not really.
00:22:16 I don't know. I mean, I've thought about this plenty
00:22:18 as as as I was a reader of Naruto and whatnot.
00:22:21 It just seems that like, I mean, Hinata is kind of
00:22:25 she was just the what's the word?
00:22:27 She was kind of the grassroots favorite girl
00:22:29 that like obviously not a lot of emphasis was put on her at
00:22:32 front at first, but like her just quiet like liking of Naruto
00:22:35 and appreciation of the character the same way the audience did.
00:22:38 I think just like the lack of being annoying in any way.
00:22:41 It's so it's so easy to like Hinata.
00:22:45 Yeah, it's so easy. I get it.
00:22:47 Yeah, it makes sense to be fair.
00:22:50 I cannot. I used to be my favorite back when I was watching
00:22:52 just because I could sort of relate to her because shy, quiet.
00:22:56 Yeah, it's it's in dear.
00:22:58 It's endearing. Yeah, Sakura.
00:23:01 I would hate I hated her.
00:23:02 I like the woman to know her place.
00:23:04 You know what I'm saying? It really does a lot for me.
00:23:07 I hate it, Sakura, just because like she was very loud, obnoxious, mean
00:23:12 and violent. Yeah, like it's not so we all aspire to be.
00:23:18 I still don't like Sakura to this age,
00:23:20 but just because they're still like lingering feelings from those times
00:23:25 when I actually used to watch Naruto, but I haven't seen her in the new,
00:23:29 you know, like I haven't really watched Shippuden and I haven't really watched
00:23:34 Boruto. Well, I don't know.
00:23:35 I got one good fight in Shippuden as the show goes on.
00:23:38 Yeah, I know she does not.
00:23:40 Sakura sucks. She never does anything cool.
00:23:42 She has she has some cool scenes.
00:23:45 Like when she fights, what's his name? All the puppet guy.
00:23:48 I was going to say, let's not forget that in that fight,
00:23:51 look, I watched that fight again.
00:23:52 It's not even really her doing the fight.
00:23:54 But she's the old lady.
00:23:56 But it's her super strength.
00:23:57 Like she like she legitimately
00:23:59 brings her own super strength to contribute to that battle.
00:24:02 OK, you're not wrong.
00:24:03 And that's not like a nod.
00:24:04 Well, as the fight goes on, though, she has the best thing Sakura ever did.
00:24:07 As the fight goes on, she has to fight by herself as well, too.
00:24:10 If that's OK, if that's the best thing Sakura ever did,
00:24:13 then I guess I'm glad I stopped reading when I did.
00:24:15 I think that was a wise move.
00:24:16 But compared that to at the very end of of Shippuden during the final battle,
00:24:21 they of course give the like when Sasuke final is like, OK,
00:24:24 I'll help you guys fight the final battle.
00:24:25 They do the like Team Seven has reunited Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke.
00:24:29 I actually just happened to see this the other day and like they give
00:24:33 they give Sakura like they just like give her a token punch.
00:24:37 Agreed. And then Naruto looks over and goes like,
00:24:39 oh, wow, Sakura's really come a long way.
00:24:42 Naruto is a billion times stronger than this girl.
00:24:44 Sasuke is 10 billion times stronger than her.
00:24:47 OK, but it's so pandering.
00:24:49 OK, OK, OK, but like no, no, listen, but like Sasuke has like his eyes thing.
00:24:55 And Naruto has like a demon in him.
00:24:57 Sakura is just a normal girl that just became super strong.
00:25:00 I know. Boring.
00:25:03 She also didn't she also become like a doctor?
00:25:05 That's pretty cool.
00:25:05 Well, she got trained by what's her face?
00:25:08 To not. And so she gets like like her.
00:25:11 And you know what?
00:25:12 Tsunade sucks, too.
00:25:13 Tsunade never did anything cool.
00:25:15 She punches hard sometimes and summons a snail.
00:25:18 These are the two things she ever does.
00:25:20 Punching hard is kind of cool. Boring.
00:25:21 If I could punch hard, I'd do it.
00:25:23 Snails are pretty epic.
00:25:25 In a series like Naruto.
00:25:27 Just OK, the problem is in a series like Dragon Ball Z,
00:25:31 punching hard matters is important.
00:25:32 Like technical fighting techniques matter in Naruto.
00:25:35 Like Taijutsu and stuff is like never developed at all.
00:25:39 It's just either you can punch really hard or you can't.
00:25:42 You've got one card to play and like that's she plays that card
00:25:46 and it's boring every single time it's played.
00:25:48 The punching hard card is so one note in Naruto
00:25:51 because the series isn't designed for it.
00:25:53 I somehow have both feelings that that Sakura is cool,
00:25:57 but she also got totally cucked by the show and should have done more.
00:26:01 A bit. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how those are
00:26:04 both in my head at the same time, but they are.
00:26:07 Yeah, I think Sakura does have potential, at least from what I know of her
00:26:11 and all the things is just, yeah, the show doesn't.
00:26:14 It's not about her, the show, sadly, and she doesn't get a lot of screen time.
00:26:17 She gets token screen time.
00:26:19 Yes, she does.
00:26:20 Which is what you said, her fault.
00:26:22 I mean, no, but is it her fault that she has the worst thing?
00:26:26 The worst thing Sakura does is forgive Sasuke.
00:26:29 I'm sorry. That was.
00:26:31 Oh, my God, after all he did to her, it's funny, hilarious.
00:26:33 And Rockley is there the whole time being the coolest guy in the entire show.
00:26:38 Disgusting, disgusting.
00:26:40 That Sakura's why I hate women. Confirmed.
00:26:46 Yeah, yeah, let's all simmer down and just watch a good,
00:26:50 a good old Naruto AMV set to Linkin Park.
00:26:54 Yes, do you see into the.
00:26:57 Got to watch Naruto versus Gaara set to disturb circa 2003.
00:27:01 Yeah, that's my shit.
00:27:03 That's my shit, Tom. Fucking aesthetic.
00:27:06 I had once made like an R2MV set to like
00:27:09 have an essence bring me to life.
00:27:10 Oh, is it so on YouTube?
00:27:12 You were one of the billions, one of the billions to do so.
00:27:16 That was the primary currency of the realm at that time.
00:27:19 Little to do, you know, me and Ben both like got off to the to the AMV
00:27:22 mage made back in the day before we even knew who mage was.
00:27:25 Our paths cross much like Team Seven themselves.
00:27:29 We all we were we had a bond all this way back back in action.
00:27:35 But OK, to be fair to Sakura and, you know,
00:27:38 like Hinata doesn't get much development either.
00:27:40 But I think like people just shit on Sakura a lot more than they do
00:27:43 on Hinata for the same reasons.
00:27:45 And but do you think it's because Hinata has big tits and Sakura doesn't.
00:27:49 Big tits blinds you to all character flaws.
00:27:54 And it's I mean, that's part of it.
00:27:56 I mean, let's not fool ourselves.
00:27:58 That's definitely part of it.
00:27:59 It's anyway, I guess like it's a little and I think it's a little unfair.
00:28:02 I like Hinata just because the way she is.
00:28:05 I don't need her to be strong.
00:28:06 And I don't necessarily, I guess, need Sakura to be strong.
00:28:10 My issue with Sakura is her personality or was used to be her personality.
00:28:14 It probably changed since she was like 12 or something.
00:28:16 I don't even I don't even have like a quote unquote problem with her personality.
00:28:20 I just think it's so justified to just like Hinata more
00:28:24 because she's way more likable, generalist and does more interesting things.
00:28:27 Hinata's got like a cooler power.
00:28:30 She's got that is it Ryuga clan?
00:28:33 Ryuga clan, Ryuga clan like the Biakugan, which is awesome.
00:28:38 And look, it's not anyone's fault that some people have magic powers inborn.
00:28:42 It's Kishimoto's fault for writing the series that way,
00:28:45 that some people are just way cooler than other people.
00:28:47 I kind of the thing that I kind of liked is like they had Rock Lee kind of like
00:28:52 overcoming that with pure effort.
00:28:54 And like they have this kind of setup with Sakura saying
00:28:57 like she wants to catch up to Naruto and Sasuke and like getting her training
00:29:02 kind of like sets that up, but it never really finishes.
00:29:05 Like it doesn't go anywhere.
00:29:06 Like she gets like stronger, but never to like the same degree.
00:29:09 And she never gets any moments like Rock Lee does.
00:29:12 And you're just like, you know what, I just realized.
00:29:14 And so and there's remember that moment where Rock Lee is fighting that bone guy
00:29:17 and like he's going to lose.
00:29:19 He tries the drunken technique.
00:29:20 It doesn't, you know, let him win.
00:29:21 And then Gara shows up and he's the one who defeats that bone guy.
00:29:24 And you know why?
00:29:25 You know what the key advantage Gara had over Rock Lee as we see later?
00:29:29 Rock Lee only had a dad who was like a weird deadbeat, the eternal
00:29:33 Ganyne or whatever.
00:29:35 But but fucking Gara had a loving mother who died loving him.
00:29:39 So it's the it's the advantage of a two parent household.
00:29:42 Gara is like Gara that pushed him over the edge.
00:29:44 Gara is like evil Harry Potter.
00:29:46 He's like evil Harry Potter because his mom died and gave him like magic protection.
00:29:51 That's true. Only it turned him into a fucking demon instead of.
00:29:54 Oh, it all worked out eventually.
00:29:56 And that was great.
00:29:57 OK, you want to know the thing.
00:29:59 OK, this is this is such a perfect example of the thing I hate most about
00:30:03 like writing in general, how like memes of characters can become more
00:30:07 than they were ever supposed to be.
00:30:09 And it's that, OK, we all know Gara.
00:30:11 Gara has like those really deep like black things around his eyes.
00:30:14 And like it's discussed in early Naruto, why that is.
00:30:17 He cannot sleep because he's possessed by a demon.
00:30:20 He like has terrible insomnia.
00:30:21 It gives him these like ridges around his eyes.
00:30:23 OK, Gara, this is the most retarded thing of all time.
00:30:26 It's when way later at the end of Shippuden, Gara's dad, like the third,
00:30:31 what do you call it, the Wind Kage, Kaze Kage gets revived or whatever.
00:30:35 Yeah, for like the final battle.
00:30:37 Like, of course, like we've seen with that guy looks like he looks like Gara,
00:30:40 but without the bags in his eyes, red hair, whatever.
00:30:43 And he fights with gold dust. OK, that's all fine.
00:30:45 But then he's like, oh, shit, I got a power up to fight my tongue, my fucking son.
00:30:50 Here I go, ninja art, like I power.
00:30:53 And he fucking activates like a ninja technique to get the like
00:30:56 black lines around his eyes, as if that's some sort of advantage.
00:31:00 Wait, does this happen? I don't even remember this.
00:31:03 I'm telling you right now.
00:31:04 I was just like six months ago.
00:31:06 Look like my son knows you.
00:31:08 Was this cut from them?
00:31:08 Fucking. No, what?
00:31:10 This can't be right. It's in there.
00:31:11 I'm telling you, at the very least, it's in the anime.
00:31:13 And I mean, I mean, I remember them saying that he has those because he can't sleep.
00:31:19 But like, I thought that later it was just like,
00:31:22 because, like, obviously he loses the demon later, too.
00:31:25 So why does he keep that?
00:31:26 That's my point. That was what I was wondering.
00:31:27 And I thought it was just like Naruto has like the marks on his face
00:31:30 because he has the demon fox.
00:31:34 So I figured I think he had those
00:31:35 when he was born before he had the demon in him, though.
00:31:37 That's that's so it's so fucking strange.
00:31:40 He was like put it in the right when he was born.
00:31:43 Things over his eyes.
00:31:44 And like that's because he's a raccoon, right?
00:31:46 It's the raccoon demon that he had.
00:31:48 So I was like, oh, it's like they have like facial markings to represent
00:31:51 the the the beast that they had.
00:31:53 And maybe that's what Kishimoto was going for with the initial design.
00:31:56 And then tried to justify it later or whatever.
00:31:58 It was dumb. It was stupid.
00:32:00 Yep. Keep your story straight.
00:32:01 Look at this fucking chud.
00:32:04 Look at this fucking look at this fucking Melvin.
00:32:07 Oh, yeah, that's him activating the secret art.
00:32:09 I power Garajutsu.
00:32:11 It's just a fucking consequence of insomnia.
00:32:14 That's not a real power.
00:32:16 See, and maybe insomnia is a power and we're all fools.
00:32:20 I mean, we're all wasting how many hours of our day.
00:32:22 All right, could be, you know, I'm going to stop sleeping and see if I get stronger
00:32:25 or report back next week.
00:32:27 It's just OK.
00:32:28 And for those who aren't obvious, this is an obvious.
00:32:30 It's just that like they just made like a character design trope into like a power
00:32:35 because I don't know.
00:32:38 It looks cool, I guess.
00:32:39 It doesn't even make sense. Epic.
00:32:41 Oh, it's simply because he looks like a boy band.
00:32:44 It's dumb.
00:32:45 But they do this shit all the time.
00:32:47 Mage and honestly, this is the exact same logic as where hockey came from in one
00:32:52 piece, like it is that same thing.
00:32:54 And you can do it better or worse.
00:32:56 Hockey is generally OK.
00:32:57 There's some problems with it, but it's this same thing that's happening here.
00:33:02 I'm trying to read the text in this these like series of screenshots that
00:33:06 Mage posted, but I'm just distracted by the fact that in the two close-ups
00:33:11 of Gara, his facial like proportions completely change.
00:33:14 And there was no reason you just recycle that frame.
00:33:18 It's very bizarre.
00:33:20 It is.
00:33:21 Well, what can you do?
00:33:23 Sometimes things are shit.
00:33:24 And by the way, I googled it.
00:33:25 I'm like pretty sure Naruto had the lines on his face before he had the demon stuck in him.
00:33:30 But I could be wrong.
00:33:32 So I won't I won't die on that.
00:33:34 Didn't they put the thing in in like the moment he was born?
00:33:36 Yeah, I mean, no, very closely.
00:33:38 And there was some amount of time.
00:33:40 Oh, OK, well, it's like a matter of like maybe an hour or two tops
00:33:43 because like he's born in secret because they have to like keep him locked away and shit
00:33:48 because they're and then immediately what's his face attacks them?
00:33:52 I forget everybody's names.
00:33:53 You know, it's all wait a minute.
00:33:54 You know what?
00:33:55 There is one thing that I think is maybe kind of reasonable.
00:33:58 Am I correct in in thinking that his mom was the genturiki of the Fox before him?
00:34:04 And OK, so the fact that the Fox was in up in his mom while he was born,
00:34:09 suddenly it seems a bit more reasonable.
00:34:11 He might have Fox markings on his face.
00:34:13 Because, you know, that's the real father.
00:34:15 The Fox is the father is my point.
00:34:18 So, OK, fair enough, at least half the father.
00:34:22 OK, that one's fine.
00:34:23 But this Garai shit is the most retarded thing I've ever seen in my life.
00:34:27 A blatant retcon or just ignoring your established canon.
00:34:31 It's not even a retcon.
00:34:32 It's simply a misunderstanding of his own series.
00:34:36 Oh, that makes me mad.
00:34:38 I remember fan art of Garai applying mascara like the emo boy that he was.
00:34:45 Yes, good one.
00:34:47 Thanks for the two thousands internet.
00:34:49 You shaped me into who I am today.
00:34:54 So, OK, we we've dismantled Naruto fundamentally at an ideological level.
00:34:58 What else is on the table?
00:35:00 Boys, well, everyone's telling me I got to get off Twitter.
00:35:04 And I should probably get off Twitter.
00:35:06 I mean, yeah, I can I can I recommend after this whole unpleasantness
00:35:12 with me and Digi and Mr.
00:35:14 Medicare, Mr. Medicare got involved.
00:35:17 Yeah, did you see what I tell this?
00:35:19 Should I tell this story a little bit?
00:35:21 It's an interesting story. It's amusing.
00:35:23 It's I feel I feel pretty you have to.
00:35:27 If you don't want to, we know it's fine.
00:35:29 I just I don't like how it went.
00:35:31 I don't like how the tone of it evolved.
00:35:32 But like, OK, all right, I guess I got to talk about.
00:35:35 OK, you guys see that video that Medeker did about how the sausage is made?
00:35:40 It's horrible. I tried to watch it.
00:35:42 I could not sit through.
00:35:43 I mean, you know, it's don't know this video.
00:35:45 I mean, OK, it's it's terrible.
00:35:48 I always say that because surgery looks gross no matter what it is.
00:35:50 So that's not a criticism.
00:35:52 Yeah, I mean, it's an unpleasant video, no matter how you slice it.
00:35:54 But like, yeah, yeah, it's like a pretty long video of like graphics.
00:36:02 Like, like bottom surgery footage,
00:36:04 like people getting their dicks inverted and stuff.
00:36:06 Oh, dear. And so it's that.
00:36:08 I want to watch that.
00:36:09 And and Medeker, he just like he just like snarks over the whole time.
00:36:14 Like, it's not educational.
00:36:15 It's for it's he's there to like make fun of it.
00:36:18 And it's really gross, like on every level.
00:36:22 And he got deep flat and he says drops the fucking N word like a bunch of times.
00:36:25 And it's I don't know why it's not it's not it's not even like a joke.
00:36:29 He just says it.
00:36:31 OK, he's fucking says it for no reason.
00:36:32 I it's yeah, OK, I don't like sure.
00:36:36 But he got deep platformed.
00:36:38 Did you didn't agree with him getting deep platformed, which is one thing.
00:36:42 But then he defended the video and I think the video is indefensible.
00:36:46 So I was like, no.
00:36:48 And then and then some shit happened.
00:36:51 And then also at the same time, coincidentally,
00:36:53 I made some comments on May's sexy Greta Thunberg, which I didn't really care for.
00:37:00 But then other people jumped into that conversation.
00:37:02 And that turned way uglier than I meant to say.
00:37:04 The worst thing about that conversation was some people said,
00:37:07 are you cosplaying sans with her blue hoodie?
00:37:09 Well, I was literally there cosplaying sans.
00:37:12 Yes, I had a black hoodie, but I was still sans.
00:37:15 That's the real crime being committed here.
00:37:16 It's a shame. What a shame.
00:37:17 Why don't you get in there?
00:37:18 Why don't you get in the photo? I should have.
00:37:20 I should have called him out.
00:37:21 OK, but so but so.
00:37:24 So I say like this, you know, this.
00:37:28 Oh, God, how do the kind? It doesn't matter.
00:37:30 I mean, did you just agree?
00:37:31 Did you seem to get pretty annoyed with me over over this stuff?
00:37:36 There were some fairly strong accusations made.
00:37:39 I don't think I made any accusations that strong.
00:37:42 Somebody asked me.
00:37:43 Somebody asked me, is Digi on the alt right pipeline?
00:37:47 And I thought the question was, is he on it?
00:37:49 Like, is he going down it?
00:37:51 And I think that Dick, I think that Dick Masterson is absolutely someone
00:37:55 who's part of the pipeline.
00:37:57 So I said, yes.
00:37:58 But it was interpreted.
00:37:59 I think the guy meant to ask is Digi part of the pipeline.
00:38:02 And I don't know. I don't I don't not sure.
00:38:04 So I. So that was that was dumb.
00:38:08 It wasn't dumb, but it was we were talking about two different things.
00:38:10 So there's certainly some degree of miscommunication
00:38:12 on exactly the nature of.
00:38:14 But did but did you got mad?
00:38:16 Did you got mad at me because he said that I would I would defend
00:38:19 Monkey Jones while I was while I would not do this.
00:38:22 Well, I would like attack like someone like
00:38:25 Medicare. And I was like, yeah, you know, I guess I guess it's it's true.
00:38:29 Monkey has some of the same problems here that I would object to.
00:38:33 Is he kind of the same?
00:38:34 And I said and I said that Dick Masterson,
00:38:37 Medicare and Monkey are all cut from the same cloth.
00:38:39 They're all privileged popcorn, nihilists will hand wave away
00:38:43 problems that don't affect them personally.
00:38:46 And I think that's true.
00:38:48 And Medicare saw that and he
00:38:50 he made it his fucking Twitter bio,
00:38:54 but he didn't understand what I meant.
00:38:56 He didn't know the phrase popcorn nihilist,
00:38:59 as in Charlie Brown is a popcorn nihilist.
00:39:03 And he thought I was calling him privileged popcorn.
00:39:06 Like he thought that was the phrase I was trying to say.
00:39:09 And so he said he was like, I can't wait for the next
00:39:12 popcorn privilege party.
00:39:14 And I'm very upset.
00:39:15 I was misinterpreted, misunderstood.
00:39:17 I don't mind that he was like, make fun of my tweet.
00:39:20 But I'm but I do mind that he got it backwards
00:39:24 and is making fun of a misunderstood version of it.
00:39:27 I don't even understand.
00:39:28 Misunderstanding seems to seems to be the root of all your Twitter problems, Ben.
00:39:33 It's almost like everyone's Twitter problem doesn't allow for
00:39:36 for a great degree of clarity and communication.
00:39:39 I maybe maybe you shouldn't use it like that.
00:39:42 Then I don't know.
00:39:45 Popcorn nihilist, Ben, you just have to do it.
00:39:50 You just have to become a breadtuber.
00:39:52 Like you have like like you're just at that point.
00:39:55 You're just at that point as much as I don't even want to encourage it.
00:39:59 Like it's better to like have a video where you can actually explain your point
00:40:03 as opposed to going on these Twitter escapades that get literally nowhere.
00:40:07 I guess so.
00:40:08 I mean, I mean, comparing the two things.
00:40:12 It's time to graduate from the new adventures of Winnie the Pooh analysis
00:40:15 into something truly evil.
00:40:16 Among the two, that's true.
00:40:18 And I'm sure it happens less.
00:40:19 But people can still pick and choose pieces of statements made and even
00:40:23 not like willfully misinterpret, but like people just inherently read
00:40:28 what they want to into what other people say and don't always, you know,
00:40:32 get down to the exact meaning the other person was saying or take a little clip.
00:40:35 And sure, maybe they legitimately only heard the little clip or something.
00:40:39 But then it sounds worse.
00:40:41 I just it's all bad.
00:40:42 It's all bad.
00:40:43 As a person who has long breaks from Twitter, I would highly recommend
00:40:48 to sometimes just take long breaks from Twitter.
00:40:51 It's not healthy.
00:40:52 Honestly, I feel a lot better from taking breaks like today.
00:40:55 I scroll through Twitter and, you know, I saw a lot of that Sakura Hinata discourse.
00:40:59 Like, who cares?
00:41:00 I wish I wish my time line had that on it.
00:41:03 That's much better than what I usually see when it comes to drama.
00:41:06 I mean, there's a lot of other stuff.
00:41:08 But I just like I just look at it.
00:41:10 I'm like, oh, I don't want this anymore.
00:41:13 So I shut off Twitter and I want to play banished.
00:41:17 Understandable, understandable.
00:41:20 This is part of why I just decided a while ago.
00:41:23 I just I just am not I don't want to do this stuff.
00:41:26 So I pretty much just follow like anime girl accounts on Twitter.
00:41:29 That's pretty much all I follow.
00:41:30 Getting into arguments on Twitter is very pointless.
00:41:34 If you ask, it's very it's very pointless.
00:41:36 Nobody is understanding each other.
00:41:38 We're talking to each other if you want to.
00:41:41 If you're current, if the currency of your realm,
00:41:43 I don't know why I keep using that phrase, but like if the thing that you like
00:41:46 profit off of is like, I mean, if you're like, for example,
00:41:50 like a drama YouTuber or like a even like some kind of like political person
00:41:54 and people like and you have like an ideological bent and people just like
00:41:59 to see fighting going like seemingly, quote unquote, productive fighting
00:42:03 against the other side, not I mean, you know, but everybody does this.
00:42:06 Does engage this to any degree.
00:42:08 Like it's useful and beneficial to have more of that happening.
00:42:11 So you can capitalize on it.
00:42:13 Yeah, but that's not me every time.
00:42:14 Like I lose followers every time I get in an argument on Twitter,
00:42:18 like every single time.
00:42:20 If you really want to like discuss or argue with a person,
00:42:24 just like ask them if you can take it to DMs or add them on on on like
00:42:29 discord or something.
00:42:30 I don't know.
00:42:30 I just don't think Twitter is a good platform for arguing and everyone suffers for it.
00:42:34 You know, you know, a lot of I heard I heard quite a few people
00:42:37 shitting on you, Ben, for these things.
00:42:38 But I must say, I feel sympathetic because the nature of Twitter is so seductive.
00:42:43 Like, you know, I heard some people just being like, you know, why is Ben,
00:42:46 you know, like being a jerk about this thing?
00:42:48 But I just thought, well, I mean, he's just using Twitter as intended.
00:42:51 He's just saying the thing he thinks about the thing that was posted.
00:42:55 Is that not exactly the funny thing is that I don't really think that I said
00:42:59 anything all that inflammatory, except for maybe the pipeline thing,
00:43:03 which was I was I was misunderstood in what I was saying.
00:43:06 Sure, that's exactly true.
00:43:08 Because like, I heard some people mad at like your response to May, for example.
00:43:12 And I just thought I actually looked at your message.
00:43:14 I was like, Ben seems pretty tepid here.
00:43:16 It doesn't seem particularly mean.
00:43:18 So yeah, I was just surprised that people were so.
00:43:21 I people like, why do you have things from the past?
00:43:24 But I just didn't seem that, you know, death.
00:43:27 I don't know.
00:43:27 OK, you can say how you want that that tweet was a month old.
00:43:31 But like, they had just discussed it on a podcast like a couple days before
00:43:36 and had been talking about that podcast recently, so it's not dragging up old shit.
00:43:41 It's not. Yeah, it's not.
00:43:42 It feels like if you're if you're just on Twitter, but if you watch that podcast,
00:43:46 as I did, like, I think the day this happened, I was like, ah,
00:43:50 I see where this discussion came from and it is not.
00:43:53 Yeah, I listen to it.
00:43:54 Shit. Yeah.
00:43:56 And I don't know.
00:43:57 We probably don't quite agree.
00:43:59 More of the story.
00:44:00 Follow everybody on everything.
00:44:01 Watch all the content and you'll always know exactly what's going on,
00:44:05 even if you don't want to.
00:44:07 Yeah, well,
00:44:11 there's just very annoyed, very annoyed about every every aspect of what
00:44:17 it's pretty funny that Twitter bills itself as a communication platform.
00:44:21 And yet it's the worst opposite.
00:44:22 It's like like more like the anti social network.
00:44:25 I'll say, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, dude.
00:44:28 Got him.
00:44:29 Bravo.
00:44:30 Shut it all down.
00:44:31 Destroyed.
00:44:32 Oh, dude, what if what if at the end of the movie, the social network,
00:44:35 they like reveal that word was hidden there?
00:44:37 Like, oh, like under a sign, there's like a piece of cardboard
00:44:39 like falls and does that like swing off of it?
00:44:41 You know, in front of the front of the sign out front of the building or whatever.
00:44:45 OK, got him.
00:44:47 Final note on that.
00:44:48 Fuck, Mr. Medeker, he's a Nazi.
00:44:50 There you go.
00:44:51 A Nazi.
00:44:52 I think he is definitely that word.
00:44:54 Definitely.
00:44:55 He's definitely he's a fascist who hates the Jews.
00:44:59 OK, hang on.
00:45:01 What if you are that but you don't you aren't willing to kill anyone?
00:45:04 Is that still a Nazi?
00:45:06 Yeah, yeah, I would say.
00:45:08 As long as we're clear, I would say pretty much.
00:45:10 I would say pretty much fair enough, fair enough.
00:45:15 All right, good.
00:45:17 Well, that's my story.
00:45:19 I'm sure everyone has their own interpretation of events and whatnot.
00:45:22 Also, this art of Hinata in different art styles is very cute.
00:45:26 I like it, Mage.
00:45:27 I've seen things like that recently.
00:45:29 I like this idea way better.
00:45:31 Yeah, it's good.
00:45:33 Also, look at how can you not like Hinata?
00:45:34 She's just she's just a lovely on the eyes.
00:45:38 She's easy.
00:45:38 She's easy to like.
00:45:39 Yeah, she's designed.
00:45:40 She's unchallenging.
00:45:42 Unvirginally.
00:45:43 She's the beloved Hinata.
00:45:45 She's she's she's unclouded by normal cognition.
00:45:50 You know what I'm talking about?
00:45:51 You know what I'm referencing there?
00:45:52 I don't.
00:45:53 I don't know that one.
00:45:55 Well, it's a spoiler, but in in Midsommar, there's a guy there, like,
00:45:59 profit is like the guy who's like a product of inbreeding.
00:46:02 And he's like all messed up and shit.
00:46:04 And like, they have him like finger paint in a book and then they like
00:46:07 interpret what the finger paintings mean.
00:46:10 And they say that he's unclouded by normal cognition.
00:46:14 So me and Munchy have been saying that all the time.
00:46:17 My reference was I'm feeling so unclouded right now.
00:46:21 What's his face?
00:46:22 The Candyland guy for a Leonardo DiCaprio's character from Jango Unchained
00:46:27 when he describes the old Joe Ben who was unclouded, no, unburdened by genius,
00:46:32 unburdened by genius, shaved his daddy's straight razor for 50 years.
00:46:37 And if it was him there, he would have cut his daddy's throat and it wouldn't
00:46:41 have taken him no 50 years, neither.
00:46:43 Great lines, great delivery, great characters.
00:46:47 Task support of slavery.
00:46:48 Man, we did it.
00:46:50 This Joe Joe version.
00:46:51 I don't like the Joe Joe ones.
00:46:53 People always fuck up Joe Joe artwork.
00:46:55 That's too. That's fucked up.
00:46:56 That looks terrible. Yeah, it's not quite.
00:46:58 It's not quite it, fam.
00:47:00 Heels are just a little bit softer looking than that.
00:47:03 Just a little bit.
00:47:05 Oh, and this is not everybody fucks up Joe Joe art.
00:47:07 And also it's people have a lot of trouble adapting to one piece art, too.
00:47:12 Like this kind of looks like Hinata, but like, I mean, like just for example,
00:47:17 like Nico Robin literally had Hinata's exact haircut.
00:47:22 And yet this looks way worse than like Robin's because they give it
00:47:26 like the rounded thing on the I don't know why they did that.
00:47:28 They just thought that's what one piece characters look like, I guess.
00:47:32 People fuck up one piece art so bad.
00:47:33 It's hard to interpret someone else's art style perfectly.
00:47:36 There are subtle.
00:47:37 That's what we all need.
00:47:38 Generic anime art style is the peak.
00:47:40 We need to all convene the house style.
00:47:42 If you type of drawing, I like the demon slayer one.
00:47:45 I like the hair just like it all swishy.
00:47:47 I like the My Hair Academia one.
00:47:48 Yeah, they're both good.
00:47:49 They're both good.
00:47:50 I like the Dragon Ball Z one because it's purple.
00:47:52 It's like literally just literally.
00:47:55 No, she had purple hair and blue sometimes.
00:47:57 So she changes.
00:47:58 It's true.
00:48:00 OK, what else is going on?
00:48:02 I've got nothing. I'm out.
00:48:04 I bought I bought games on the Black Friday sale.
00:48:07 And one of them is, you know, Cooney, Raffa the White Witch.
00:48:10 And they played. Oh, how is it?
00:48:11 I've heard many things about it.
00:48:13 It's so cute. I love it.
00:48:14 There's so many puns and it's so whimsical.
00:48:16 And I've been bothering Byter about how whimsy it is.
00:48:19 And she's like, oh, so much.
00:48:21 We did that too, right?
00:48:22 But yeah, the first one.
00:48:23 Yeah, yeah.
00:48:24 And I actually bought the sequel on the PC as well because sales.
00:48:28 And I've been wanting both.
00:48:29 I didn't even open Steam on Black Friday.
00:48:31 A small mercy.
00:48:32 I didn't even realize I granted myself.
00:48:34 Oh, yeah, you know, that's smart.
00:48:35 You know, I on Digi's recommendation, it wasn't a recommend,
00:48:39 but like Digi in some podcast or something recently was just talking so
00:48:42 glowingly about, he's like, every RPG sucks in the world lately,
00:48:46 except for cross code.
00:48:49 And I was like, oh, what's Digi likes in RPG that he found was like worth his time.
00:48:52 What is that?
00:48:53 That podcast was the content on Pokémon that you just posted a few days ago.
00:48:58 That's that's correct.
00:48:59 That's that you were on.
00:49:01 I, you know, these things just they roll off my back.
00:49:03 I can't remember anything.
00:49:05 But I played that game.
00:49:06 I've been playing it and probably five, six hours in.
00:49:08 It's great. I fucking love it.
00:49:11 It's fantastic.
00:49:12 I've heard I was I was with Digi when I was playing it and I'm mad
00:49:16 because he was like, all right, I'm going to play cross code.
00:49:18 I'm going to devote like 80 hours to playing this game
00:49:21 so I can be the first one to make a fucking massive video for I am games about it.
00:49:25 I'm like, all right, cool, that's sick.
00:49:27 And then he beat it.
00:49:28 He's like, I don't feel like it.
00:49:29 And I was like, you fucking didn't get 20 hours in and gave up.
00:49:33 He gave up people are now hungry for more content.
00:49:36 Jump. I do it.
00:49:37 I played the cross code demo on like new grounds when it was new.
00:49:42 Yeah, it was you ever play phenotopia?
00:49:45 I don't know. I don't know.
00:49:46 Phenotopia was like a site.
00:49:47 It was sort of cave story-esque, but like not as actiony,
00:49:51 but it was like a side scrolling action RPG.
00:49:54 And it was it was it was like a new grounds release, like five or six,
00:49:58 maybe more years ago.
00:50:00 And just I played that and it was it was really great.
00:50:03 And like the developer has been working on remaking it ever since for the last
00:50:07 like six years. Oh my god. OK.
00:50:10 And yeah, and also making the sequel like at the same time.
00:50:15 And but just at that very moment,
00:50:19 cross code also released its demo and I played it.
00:50:22 And I didn't like it that much.
00:50:24 I didn't care. I didn't see what the all the hype was.
00:50:26 Yeah. Well, maybe it's evolved since then.
00:50:28 OK, it's feel like it must have because like the demo I played was like very bare
00:50:32 bones. Oh, this I mean, I would definitely say this is not bare bones.
00:50:35 This is. Yeah. I mean, I feel like there's a lot going on.
00:50:39 It's like, but I mean, you know, now's a good chance for me to talk about
00:50:41 because I don't I don't maybe I'll make a video on it someday.
00:50:43 But like it's it's got just such satisfying
00:50:47 gameplay of it's it's 16 bit graphics.
00:50:50 You're moving around this world.
00:50:51 You're grinding. It's like every action you do.
00:50:53 It's it's satisfying in the like the the like the egovania style.
00:50:57 Or I don't know. I get like Secret of Mana kind of.
00:51:00 We're running around.
00:51:01 You're doing melee stuff.
00:51:02 But you've also got this very satisfying long range combat that, to be honest,
00:51:05 is a little hard to do with a thumbstick.
00:51:06 It's a little bit imprecise.
00:51:08 I feel like it maybe is better played with a with a mouse.
00:51:10 But nonetheless, it it's really fun and you get party members are grinding.
00:51:15 And there's this story that actually it's it's very much like a dot hack.
00:51:20 That one dot hack show, there's like a million shows.
00:51:22 But the one with that guy who's like in the world
00:51:25 and they forget how Amnesia is like as a part of the narrative.
00:51:29 But it's also very much it's like Greed Island.
00:51:31 It's actually it's exactly like the Hunter Hunter Ark Greed Island
00:51:33 that I just made a wee Agua about because it's about like a
00:51:38 a real world place where people like warp in digital avatars to go explore.
00:51:44 Like kind of in a in a kind of like in Avatar, the movie, how you like
00:51:48 are to your consciousness like in Bade, something else you can possess or whatever.
00:51:52 And you play as like a magical avatar sword art online.
00:51:56 Well, only this is a real space or online's digital.
00:51:58 But but nonetheless, it's super cool.
00:52:00 And like it's got this this is the real hook.
00:52:03 This is the real hook.
00:52:04 It's just that you start the game, you get these mechanics, but there's a big
00:52:08 there's the big hook I have as a player is just that at the very you're told
00:52:12 that you start off with like normal like a normal neutral attacks
00:52:17 that don't have any elemental properties.
00:52:18 But like the main quest is to go and collect like the four elemental things
00:52:23 kind of like Final Fantasy style, but like they actually give 10 like tangible
00:52:27 gameplay bonuses because each new like elemental thing you get
00:52:31 augments, your fighting like permanently, or it's just like a new
00:52:36 it's kind of like a new beam you get in Metroid or whatever.
00:52:38 You can just like activate them and you switch between them.
00:52:40 And just like the aspect of being on a quest where I know I'm going to get
00:52:45 like new ways to play and like new powers I'll be able to use in like creative
00:52:49 ways against enemies with like elemental weaknesses and stuff.
00:52:52 And the game like looks so good and is great.
00:52:54 I don't know.
00:52:55 The dialogue isn't like amazing or anything, but I don't know.
00:52:57 The world's it's good enough.
00:52:58 It's just it's everything about it just feels so appealing on just like on a
00:53:04 gameplay level and the story is also pretty cool too.
00:53:06 So I'm just I'm way into it.
00:53:08 What do you describe me with the, you know, you know, you play you unlock
00:53:12 more powers and stuff like that.
00:53:13 Like that's just like most RPGs aren't aren't isn't it?
00:53:18 It's just like it's different because this is actually, you know what?
00:53:21 You're right.
00:53:22 It's like it's like a fundamental thing, but it's really presented it in a
00:53:25 very appealing way and they feel like really big landmarks and big
00:53:29 achievements and I don't know.
00:53:31 It's hard to describe, but just the way it's presented seems very, it's
00:53:34 very appealing and very satisfying to pursue.
00:53:37 I mean, like in a lot of RPGs, you just sort of unlock it on level up and stuff.
00:53:41 Like, but if it's like, exactly, and I guess it's sort of neat, it's more
00:53:45 satisfying.
00:53:45 It's pretty Zelda like and stuff, but it just I'm watching the trailer and
00:53:49 it looks like there's way more going on here.
00:53:53 Also, there's a, there's a Saitama in it.
00:53:56 I posted a screenshot in the thing in the chat.
00:53:59 Oh, did you?
00:54:00 Uh, let me see.
00:54:01 A gross disgusting audio files.
00:54:04 Oh, yeah.
00:54:04 That's true.
00:54:05 There he is.
00:54:05 It's it's a indie game.
00:54:07 So there's, you know, there's memes.
00:54:09 There's I don't not like the portrait art style.
00:54:14 The art is not amazing.
00:54:15 You're absolutely right.
00:54:16 It is not amazing.
00:54:17 The sprites are nice though.
00:54:18 So I'm just the little sprites are fine.
00:54:21 How can you fuck those up?
00:54:23 I like that.
00:54:23 I sort of like all gets in tight.
00:54:26 Thank you.
00:54:27 I like the, I like the portrait of the girl though.
00:54:31 It's fine enough.
00:54:31 It has extra shading inside.
00:54:34 Look, the story, the characters, the art, it's all bullshit.
00:54:36 Who cares?
00:54:37 The point is, it's a really satisfying game to play.
00:54:41 And I'm having a great time.
00:54:42 That's, that's satisfying games.
00:54:44 Other than, you know, also, I bought Divina your drills and two, which
00:54:48 I've been craving to buy for a while and I did.
00:54:50 I only played a little bit.
00:54:51 I just got off the ship and I barely did anything.
00:54:54 But I stole eight buckets or I rather I took eight buckets.
00:54:57 I put one on my head.
00:54:58 It's a helmet now.
00:55:01 Wait, what is this?
00:55:02 Divina your drills and two.
00:55:05 I, I, I, I, I regret not taking the skill to talk to animals
00:55:10 because I missed out on talking to sheep, to two sheep and one squirrel
00:55:14 riding a skeleton cat.
00:55:15 So sex to be me.
00:55:17 There's definitely a story there for sure.
00:55:19 There's, yes.
00:55:21 Maybe next time.
00:55:22 It's fun.
00:55:23 It's pretty fun.
00:55:23 I hate the fact that the way you control the camera is a little bit clunky
00:55:29 and it takes getting used to because I'm used to like moving the
00:55:32 camera around with my right mouse button, but no, that's not how you do it.
00:55:37 I have to assign a different button.
00:55:39 I mean, like, I think there's a default button.
00:55:41 Yeah, there's a default button, but I signed it to a different button
00:55:43 just because it's more comfortable for me to have it on the mouse.
00:55:46 But it's still, it's still just so, so annoying.
00:55:49 If I forget how to do it, I just mess up the camera work.
00:55:53 But thankfully it's a trend based game.
00:55:55 So if I get into a battle, I don't, I'm not losing out on any time
00:55:59 to readjust my camera and stuff.
00:56:02 And I'm not like the old RPGs of like, like Baldur's Gate and stuff, right?
00:56:09 He thinks I haven't played Baldur's Gate, so I wouldn't know.
00:56:11 But yeah, it's very, it's very RPG, like with with nice enough graphics
00:56:18 and not super quality ones.
00:56:20 But I mean, they're good enough.
00:56:22 They're quite neat.
00:56:23 There's a skeleton dude that I may or may not romance.
00:56:26 Who knows?
00:56:32 I am a tall elf lady.
00:56:34 I'm glad to see the flash to gain the memories of the dead, which is really cool.
00:56:40 I just like that comic Chew.
00:56:43 It's just Chew. No, no, no.
00:56:45 He has no he can he's like a detective who can like eat something.
00:56:50 And if he eats something, he can like it's sort of like Bruce Willis
00:56:55 and unbreakable.
00:56:55 He can just sort of like sense like where a thing was.
00:56:59 And if he has to eat something to get it's like not its memories,
00:57:03 but like its history.
00:57:04 I think I've seen the concept thrown around.
00:57:08 But yeah, like with these elves, the one elf I met on the ship,
00:57:12 she all like she's a lot better at telling like reading memories of people.
00:57:17 So like all she had to do was like my arm and you can let her look
00:57:21 or your arm or not.
00:57:22 And I let her let her look my arm and she could tell memories
00:57:25 from my character's past, apparently.
00:57:28 So that's neat. I like it.
00:57:29 I like that's cool.
00:57:31 Yeah, I accidentally became a slave to a red lizard.
00:57:33 But I hate when that happens.
00:57:36 Yeah, but I met up with him afterwards
00:57:40 and he was like, I never mind being the slave.
00:57:42 You saved me, so you earned your freedom.
00:57:44 So I was like, OK, cool.
00:57:45 You know, I happen to watch that.
00:57:47 What's his fucking like Seth Cezniak or whatever that fucking YouTube guy
00:57:50 with the weird name.
00:57:51 I watched his video on Vampire, the Masquerades.
00:57:54 You guys ever play that game because it looked pretty dope.
00:57:57 I played the online one when I was younger.
00:58:00 I tried playing it, but my computer couldn't run it.
00:58:02 But it was kind of fun, but I didn't understand anything.
00:58:06 I was just too stupid, I guess.
00:58:08 It seems like a fairly large brain game.
00:58:10 It was.
00:58:11 I remember people talking about one of the Vampire Girls looking
00:58:15 sort of like a trashy Harley Quinn version or something.
00:58:18 Yes, that's right. That's right.
00:58:19 There's a new there's a sequel of that game coming out.
00:58:22 It's in there.
00:58:23 They're working on it now.
00:58:24 Yeah, but people are pretty, pretty hyped as I understand it.
00:58:26 Right, right.
00:58:27 It was sort of on sale the game, but wasn't on a big enough sale
00:58:31 for me to justify buying the Masquerade game.
00:58:34 Well, perhaps what I was just curious
00:58:36 if you guys played this.
00:58:37 Seth is a big fan, as it seems.
00:58:39 I liked it.
00:58:40 Yeah, I like I remember.
00:58:41 I remember liking it.
00:58:43 I just don't remember anything other than anything else about it.
00:58:49 Well, that's it.
00:58:49 That's that's my whole thought on that matter.
00:58:53 Philosophy Tube.
00:58:54 Philosophy Tube just did a video.
00:58:56 It's really good.
00:58:57 It's about I guess it's it's about the video game industry,
00:59:01 but it's in particular about like the work of Jim Sterling.
00:59:04 Yeah, I saw that thumbnail and you just dressed up as him.
00:59:07 It's very interesting.
00:59:09 Yeah, it's good.
00:59:10 It's about how like it's about how like the tendency toward monopoly
00:59:15 in in particular in the video game industry can can let like companies
00:59:21 like basically buy their way out of the supposed advantages
00:59:24 offered by the the free market.
00:59:27 Monopolies of which companies?
00:59:28 The developers or the distributors or publishers, right?
00:59:32 Both, I guess.
00:59:34 Wherever the money is.
00:59:36 I know just Jim Sterling usually has issues with publishers
00:59:39 more than anything else.
00:59:40 That's like his go to to make money.
00:59:44 I would think so.
00:59:45 Piss off the publishers, which is usually justified.
00:59:49 Not the developers, in particular, so much.
00:59:52 OK, OK.
00:59:53 You know, stuff like loot boxes and what I say,
00:59:58 though, what ways that like like like moves that the video game
01:00:02 industry makes towards like extracting more value without
01:00:07 providing a better product or like providing a service to more people
01:00:11 or anything like that. Sure.
01:00:12 I think we can all get behind that.
01:00:13 And the rent the rent to your economy where you make money
01:00:16 not by producing anything, but just by owning something,
01:00:20 whether it's like a building that you rent or just like intellectual
01:00:23 property rights that you just have.
01:00:25 I'm sending a certain ideological bent to to some of these points.
01:00:30 No, no kidding.
01:00:35 All right.
01:00:36 Well, I mean, those those are those are good things to talk.
01:00:38 I mean, fucking, I wish that I was just thinking about a game
01:00:42 that Oh, Metal Gear Rising, too.
01:00:44 Metal Gear Revengeance will never get made because Konami has
01:00:48 the fucking lockdown on and I mean, there's nothing to be done.
01:00:51 Sometimes I think about that and I die a little bit more inside every time.
01:00:55 I yeah, yeah, you know, I just saw a guy on 4chan who just had a thread
01:00:58 with a picture of of Jack about to let her rip.
01:01:01 I just beat Revengeance.
01:01:02 Wasn't it sick?
01:01:03 Wasn't it sick?
01:01:04 It it was sick.
01:01:05 It was dope. And you know what? I was I didn't expect to.
01:01:10 But the senator was making.
01:01:12 OK, dude, don't say he was making some strong red pill.
01:01:16 Is it not?
01:01:17 He was making some good points and many terrible ones.
01:01:20 I mean, surely, you know, this is a sure reason.
01:01:23 Yeah, sure. You got a pepper is some true some truth in there.
01:01:26 Of course.
01:01:26 Like his the whole premise of this thing was like, I want America
01:01:30 and Americans to be great again from the war economy and to be free
01:01:35 to fight for things they believe in, not be slaves of this like weird,
01:01:39 fucked up, you know, fucking thing where they're fighting for values.
01:01:43 They don't give a shit about it.
01:01:45 They don't understand what it's basically like a criticism of neoliberalism.
01:01:48 I understand as I understand it.
01:01:50 But like I'm noticing that we saying is we want this for Americans
01:01:55 and we will start wars to get there.
01:01:57 Fuck everybody else.
01:01:58 Well, OK, I mean, I don't know if I'm for starting many, many wars
01:02:01 for the benefit of the Americans that survive at the end of the day.
01:02:05 Is the idea is the idea that just America's got to like fucking
01:02:10 conquer everything so we don't have to fight anymore?
01:02:13 Is that the plan?
01:02:14 I'm not going to lie.
01:02:15 I need to see it again to fully digest his point because I he makes
01:02:19 this rousing speech while he's beating the shit out of you.
01:02:22 So there's a couple of things going on in the scene at once.
01:02:26 I was I get the feeling that he's just like Luffy.
01:02:29 He's just like, you know, the the like the king of the pirates
01:02:32 is the is the one who's the most free.
01:02:34 So America's got to be king of the pirates.
01:02:36 I mean, he comes in and and you know, Ryden's fighting him
01:02:38 and Ryden's like, oh, I know what you're up to, Senator.
01:02:41 Like you're a selfish crook politician, just like everybody else.
01:02:44 You just want to like start war to personally profit off of it.
01:02:47 And then Armstrong comes.
01:02:48 He's like, no, no, no, foolish child.
01:02:50 You don't understand anything like he actually has sincere beliefs.
01:02:53 But his sincere beliefs are like, first of all, you know,
01:02:57 he literally says make America great again.
01:02:58 It's fucking insane.
01:03:00 The best the best moment in that epic in video games.
01:03:04 Oh, my God, Trump ever fucking around.
01:03:05 I mean, I think Reagan had said it.
01:03:07 So like maybe they lifted from Reagan or whatever. It doesn't matter.
01:03:09 No, he never said make America great.
01:03:13 And that's why Trump used make America great again.
01:03:15 It was like a callback.
01:03:16 I'm sure someone in the past used the phrase make America great.
01:03:20 I was just wondering if this was lifting something.
01:03:22 It was Senator Armstrong, the legend.
01:03:25 All right, of course.
01:03:27 So what was the point I was making?
01:03:29 Just so like Ryden assumes he's just an evil corrupt politician.
01:03:32 Like in actuality, it's a bit more complicated.
01:03:35 The senator, he actually wants like America to be free.
01:03:38 He actually does seem to have this like libertarian mindset.
01:03:41 He wants to be king of the pirates.
01:03:44 I assume because free.
01:03:45 Yeah, because he doesn't want to.
01:03:46 He's he's not a fascist.
01:03:48 He's just willing to engage in war to like destroy.
01:03:52 He wants to like break down America.
01:03:54 He I guess you'd call it accelerationism or whatever.
01:03:56 He wants massive wars to like just to literally drain the swamp
01:04:00 and shatter like the current existing status quo
01:04:03 and then impose, as I understand it, like basically a narco capitalism
01:04:08 or something where people are just on their own.
01:04:10 Like the weak will be subjugated by the strong
01:04:13 because that's how it should be, you know, things, things of this nature.
01:04:16 OK, I see. I see. Yeah, that's some some randy and shit.
01:04:21 Yeah, pretty much, pretty much. Yeah.
01:04:23 And you know what? There's a lot of appeal.
01:04:25 There's a lot of appeal.
01:04:26 Epic. Like a banana.
01:04:28 There's a lot of appeal going on here.
01:04:31 See, Ben, it all works out for you
01:04:32 because Ryden like slices his chest open and crushes his still beating heart
01:04:37 as you was like it to be. It was fucking sick.
01:04:38 It was fucking dope.
01:04:39 I have seen I like I don't really
01:04:42 I'm not a metal gear guy.
01:04:43 I've like barely played any metal.
01:04:45 So I haven't played Revengeance,
01:04:46 but I've seen Matthew Matosis's video about Revengeance.
01:04:50 So I know about the battle with Armstrong and it does look sick.
01:04:54 Oh, you know, some people were saying that like Nate,
01:04:57 a lot of people think this is the best final boss of all time.
01:05:00 Like, what do you think?
01:05:01 And I was like, it's definitely up there.
01:05:03 I still, you know, Zemnas and Kmartz, too.
01:05:05 What can I say?
01:05:06 I mean, I mean, Armstrong is cool as hell.
01:05:09 Yeah, no doubt. No fucking doubt.
01:05:11 He is undeniably a bad man.
01:05:13 I mean, after this point, he's just a fucking politician
01:05:15 who then you think is just piloting a metal gear.
01:05:18 But no, he's also a nanomachine powered monster, man.
01:05:21 I was so happy.
01:05:22 I played that game way late, but I didn't spoil myself on anything.
01:05:25 So all of it was just like pure fucking hype.
01:05:28 Holy shit.
01:05:29 The amazing fucking cheesy line when Jack's like, you know, it's like,
01:05:33 you know, I thought my sword was a tool for justice, but I might have been wrong.
01:05:37 Besides, this isn't my sword.
01:05:39 And I was like, oh, that's a great fucking line.
01:05:42 Do this shit.
01:05:43 That's a great fucking line. Oh, my God.
01:05:45 You know, Ben, there's one other point.
01:05:46 Speaking of one piece, as we were saying before, I was curious.
01:05:50 Here, I'm going to post an image that apparently this came afterward,
01:05:54 but I can't help but feel like there are a lot of similarities
01:05:57 between like hockey in general and like the senator.
01:06:02 Now, I don't know which came from which.
01:06:03 Doesn't he turn his arms black with his whole body becomes black at various points.
01:06:07 And my boy Virgo here is just, first of all, problematic black face,
01:06:12 not appreciating that Virgo.
01:06:14 Although I still argue he's black.
01:06:15 I appreciate it.
01:06:18 And I'm just saying, there's a lot of similarities between these two characters.
01:06:23 And I believe one piece did invent hockey first,
01:06:27 like a couple of years before Revengeance came out.
01:06:30 So I'm wondering if perhaps Revengeance decided to crib a little bit from one piece.
01:06:35 I don't know.
01:06:36 I don't know.
01:06:36 These things are fairly similar.
01:06:37 I'll never know.
01:06:38 I mean, I'll never know.
01:06:40 I saw who was it?
01:06:42 There was a, it wasn't Renegade cut.
01:06:44 It was super bunny hop.
01:06:47 Super bunny hop made a video.
01:06:49 I was rewatching some super bunny.
01:06:51 Yeah, I'm sorry.
01:06:52 Just look at this.
01:06:52 You might not like it, but this is what peak male form looks like.
01:06:57 Fuck yeah, Virgo.
01:06:58 Oh my God.
01:07:00 What a legend.
01:07:00 He's beautiful.
01:07:01 He's nice.
01:07:02 He needs to hang out with Tagorell immediately.
01:07:06 They would be bros forever.
01:07:08 Bundle.
01:07:08 He's just a big bundle of ropes.
01:07:11 That's correct.
01:07:11 Also, he got so much bigger.
01:07:13 It's just just for comparison sake.
01:07:14 Look at him in the manga.
01:07:16 Like he's he's still huge, but not on this level in the in the fucking anime.
01:07:21 Well done, boys.
01:07:22 Well done.
01:07:22 I'm glad they dial it up to 11.
01:07:24 That's incredible.
01:07:26 Me too.
01:07:26 But the super bunny hop did a video about
01:07:30 Evangelion and Metal Gear Solid.
01:07:32 Yeah.
01:07:32 And, you know, there's a bunch to say about that.
01:07:35 But like in particular, like, like Evangelion is like culturally ubiquitous over there.
01:07:39 It's like it's like known in the way that like Star Wars is is is like widely known over here,
01:07:45 which is incredible.
01:07:45 I didn't I didn't really know that it was like to that extent.
01:07:48 But I imagine one piece is probably like kind of the same.
01:07:52 Like everybody knows one piece at least to a degree.
01:07:55 They'll know Luffy.
01:07:56 They'll know Chopper probably.
01:07:57 Things like that.
01:07:57 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:07:58 Yeah. So like I'd be I'd be kind of it wouldn't be surprising
01:08:03 if like some concepts from one piece had bled into someone like someone like
01:08:09 Oh, fuck, what's the what's the Metal Gear Solid guy's name?
01:08:12 Raiden Raiden.
01:08:13 No, the guy Kojima Kojima.
01:08:15 Yeah, it wouldn't be surprising if some had bled into it.
01:08:17 Like just from such like a hugely popular, culturally ubiquitous.
01:08:20 Yeah, it's not crazy to think.
01:08:23 And he's the kind of guy like like Metal Gear Solid is a fucking cultural
01:08:26 mishmash that he just made up from shit that he'd seen like like any work of art is.
01:08:31 Did you know that out of every five Japanese citizens,
01:08:34 one of them has a one piece podcast?
01:08:36 You know, it's just, you know, the podcast is just is just wrote daily life over there.
01:08:42 So much. Yeah, there's you'll never run out of content to consume.
01:08:46 Learn Japanese right now.
01:08:48 It's wise, it's wise. Yeah.
01:08:52 What?
01:08:53 Munchie just called me.
01:08:55 Munchie.
01:08:56 Why did he call you?
01:08:57 Munchie, if you have time to call back, you have time to be on the podcast.
01:09:00 Into the show, why don't you?
01:09:01 Yeah, disgusting.
01:09:03 Well, he's typing.
01:09:05 Let's let's let's let's get an explanation for this.
01:09:08 Yeah, OK, well, I mean, I'll be happy.
01:09:10 You don't have to say.
01:09:12 But we don't have to wait for I don't know how long it'll be.
01:09:14 We could go to the fucking.
01:09:16 The whole novel.
01:09:17 Oh, yeah, voicemails.
01:09:19 I mean, I got we've only got a couple here.
01:09:20 But there's I think there's four total today.
01:09:24 So not nothing, nothing too brutal.
01:09:26 Yeah, all right, fuck you guys.
01:09:27 We're good. Go to voicemails.
01:09:28 I'm ready. Good, good.
01:09:30 OK, let me see.
01:09:31 Of course, everybody leave down below in the description.
01:09:34 There's a link to the speak pipe.
01:09:35 Leave us voicemails so we can play them on the show if they are of a quality
01:09:40 persuasion. OK, let's let's go to first one.
01:09:42 First up is let me see.
01:09:45 Oh, yes, here we go.
01:09:45 This is the no nut November comrade as in comrade.
01:09:50 But C U M sends message to enemy Comers.
01:09:54 OK, it's December 1st today.
01:09:56 So the walls are splattered white across the nation, across the world.
01:10:01 So let's let's see what he has to say for himself.
01:10:03 30 of November 2019.
01:10:06 T minus seven hours till the big nut.
01:10:11 In a couple of hours, I will finally complete.
01:10:14 No, not November and show all of you disgusting comers.
01:10:19 That's how superior I am.
01:10:22 It shows my willpower is so fucking strong
01:10:26 that I can resist the urge to nut.
01:10:31 You disgust me, you lowly peasants, who cannot handle your dick.
01:10:37 You cannot handle to not handle your little dicks.
01:10:42 Fuck off, die, Comers.
01:10:44 I can't handle the responsibility.
01:10:45 Damn, got me good.
01:10:47 Oh, thank God.
01:10:48 No, not November's over today.
01:10:50 When we are recording this.
01:10:52 Indeed, indeed.
01:10:53 It feels good.
01:10:53 I am sure this the our mighty comrade here has done just fine
01:10:58 and is currently enjoying the fruits of his life.
01:11:01 Yes, congratulations, sir.
01:11:03 Bless bless.
01:11:04 All right, that's that.
01:11:06 Blessed be.
01:11:07 Let's go to the next one.
01:11:08 What do we got?
01:11:08 This is OK.
01:11:10 I don't know.
01:11:10 I don't actually know what this stands for.
01:11:12 Any idea what it's called?
01:11:13 U G W G E girl.
01:11:17 No united gamers with girlfriends.
01:11:20 I don't know.
01:11:21 Maybe it's a Gwee, a Gwee E girl, a Gwee.
01:11:26 I see, you know, I just don't know.
01:11:27 OK, well, let's come clear.
01:11:29 I don't know.
01:11:30 OK, here we go.
01:11:31 And here they go play.
01:11:33 So I had a girl who was a big tinny got girlfriend.
01:11:39 And she says, I should drink more.
01:11:42 My own do tells me I should say the N word more.
01:11:47 Who trash talks and gets in deep with face clan.
01:11:51 One day, the 360 no scope silent shot her.
01:11:55 She's in MLG.
01:11:57 Quick scoping montage is all over the internet.
01:12:01 I just want to see your game again.
01:12:04 I just want to let her know that I don't care that she got pwned.
01:12:08 So I joined the public lobby and go AFK.
01:12:12 So my Katie ratio drops.
01:12:14 And you know what?
01:12:15 She calls me a noob.
01:12:18 She unfriends me on Xbox Live.
01:12:22 Now I see the full set.
01:12:24 Now I'm always saying the N word, Nick.
01:12:30 He finally sees the sunny side.
01:12:32 I mean, wait, the funny side of life.
01:12:33 Right. Right. Yeah, good.
01:12:35 I've I've learned my new favorite euphemism is the gamer word.
01:12:40 Yes. Yeah, that's good.
01:12:41 I learned that recently.
01:12:43 And sometimes you have a gamer moment
01:12:45 when you say the gamer word happens to the best of us.
01:12:50 What what is OK?
01:12:52 What exactly is an e girl?
01:12:54 Is it just a girl, you know, on the internet?
01:12:57 I would argue it's a more specific thing than that.
01:13:00 Like it's I mean, I thought that it was like a Titty streamer
01:13:03 or like a like a male is a celeb.
01:13:07 Right. I would think it's merely defamatory
01:13:10 to just call any girl online an e girl.
01:13:13 That doesn't seem. I thought it was like there's no distinction.
01:13:15 We had some sort of like presence
01:13:17 or trying to do something on the internet.
01:13:20 Yeah. Right. Yeah.
01:13:22 Like you're not just on the internet.
01:13:24 That's passively.
01:13:25 Nate, Nate, you're trying to have an urban dictionary.
01:13:27 Yes, she's right. Oh, you're right.
01:13:29 She's right. Let's let's go.
01:13:30 Why guess from the beginning?
01:13:32 Well, because I thought it was like a female e celeb.
01:13:35 But then I feel like people toss the word around
01:13:37 in a way that it just means any girl on the internet.
01:13:41 You know, I think it's it's kind of a nebula.
01:13:43 Or it's got fuzzy and I just like everything on social media.
01:13:46 It has multiple definitions, depending on who you are.
01:13:49 OK, well, here's the top one on Urban Dictionary.
01:13:51 E girl. Finally, we've got the authority way.
01:13:53 And OK, here we go.
01:13:54 E girl, an e girl is a species of emo usually found on TikTok.
01:13:59 No, but commonly spends time on Tumblr.
01:14:01 All right. I don't give a shit about the definition.
01:14:04 I don't know what an adult has to say on the matter.
01:14:06 I mean, you commonly found doing the me, me, me, meme dance,
01:14:10 but has probably never seen it before.
01:14:11 OK, some of these things do not have to be emo to be an e girl.
01:14:15 OK, all right. Let's go to definition two here.
01:14:17 This second definition is better, I think.
01:14:19 OK, here we go. So definition one of section two here is OK.
01:14:23 E girls are usually girls who play games online
01:14:26 and can be found on either Twitter or Discord.
01:14:29 They send nudes slash thirst traps or even sell them.
01:14:33 They can also be found on Twitch.
01:14:35 But the difference between a normal girl who plays video games
01:14:37 and an e girl. OK, good.
01:14:38 To make the distinction is that an e girl begs for money
01:14:41 or sells herself for it.
01:14:42 You can theoretically beg for money and not be an e girl.
01:14:45 But if you're like selling sexy picks, that's definitely e girl.
01:14:48 That seems much closer to my general understanding of I've seen.
01:14:52 I've seen Discord servers
01:14:54 like say that like we have e girls in our Discord server as like a selling point.
01:14:59 But it sounds like a derogative.
01:15:02 Yeah, I mean, I thought it was going to be a negative like stay away.
01:15:05 We've got e girls in our ranks.
01:15:06 Don't come in here, boys. Protect.
01:15:07 No, like when I when I went on like various
01:15:10 there are sites that like you can like search and find
01:15:13 Discord servers on and I put endless war on a couple of them.
01:15:17 Like, just to know Ben was googling how to meet.
01:15:21 Someone tell me I saw and I would see the term ego.
01:15:24 So I was like, like join our server.
01:15:25 You know, we're a we're a cute, comfy community community based server.
01:15:29 You know, we got custom roles.
01:15:30 We got e girls. We got e boys.
01:15:32 And I'm like, do we want those things?
01:15:34 Are those good things? I don't.
01:15:35 What? What's what's what happened?
01:15:38 It depends on the perspective.
01:15:40 But I'll be spending my evenings at the opera.
01:15:43 Thank you. Not on your Discord server.
01:15:46 I think when you call a girl and you girl,
01:15:48 usually you could be taking as a bad thing to be called.
01:15:52 But some people just wear it was unless you're pro slut.
01:15:56 Pro slut.
01:15:58 It really depends on the perspective and the person.
01:16:01 We call it we call it sex positive.
01:16:04 These days, you're right.
01:16:06 I prefer my ancient term pro slut.
01:16:09 But yeah, you're right. You're right.
01:16:11 I don't know. It's open to interpretation.
01:16:13 If you like it, great.
01:16:14 Well, as a father or a mother,
01:16:16 would you want your daughter to be an e girl?
01:16:18 Perhaps that's the operative question to ask.
01:16:20 Probably not in the strictest definition of the term.
01:16:22 No, indeed, indeed.
01:16:24 Oh, but, you know, like, you know, I was thinking that, like,
01:16:27 if someone if like a girl is in a,
01:16:29 you know, these, these Discord chat girls will come in there
01:16:33 and they'll they'll start to throw around some oo-woos.
01:16:35 They'll start to throw around some oh woes.
01:16:38 Yeah, you know what they're doing.
01:16:39 They're baiting me. I can't resist an oo-wooh.
01:16:42 Especially capitalized, bolded, italicized.
01:16:45 I'm putty in their hands.
01:16:46 And this is female power and frankly, it's toxic.
01:16:49 It has to be changed.
01:16:50 Mages oolooing right now.
01:16:53 It's not oolooing, it's nyoron.
01:16:55 Okay, that's the I apologize.
01:16:57 That's a whole other level.
01:16:58 Mages advanced here.
01:16:59 I'm not even ready to face that kind of demon.
01:17:02 You know, I just thought I'd play this one briefly
01:17:04 as an example.
01:17:05 This seemed like a good voicemail,
01:17:07 but just listen to how unintelligible this voicemail is
01:17:10 from the ghost of scumbag, Chris.
01:17:12 If you want to go listen to it,
01:17:13 it's on the fucking SoundCloud.
01:17:14 Just give this a listen for one second.
01:17:18 Oh, oh shit, it didn't work.
01:17:20 Wait, hang on.
01:17:21 This is pretty bad.
01:17:21 I got it, I got it.
01:17:22 Okay.
01:17:23 Totally in auto.
01:17:24 Go.
01:17:25 I just wanted to point out
01:17:26 that personally, if you're applying for this November,
01:17:28 it will only become the 20th of November.
01:17:31 See, can you make out any of this?
01:17:33 Hmm.
01:17:34 I see the problem.
01:17:35 Bits and pieces.
01:17:36 Stop, stop, disconnecting.
01:17:37 I heard the word November.
01:17:39 I heard November.
01:17:40 Yeah, no, not November was being discussed.
01:17:42 I just, guys, you should listen back to your own shit
01:17:45 if you listen, because that I just cannot fucking tell.
01:17:48 Okay, no, no, no, no, listening back,
01:17:49 no, no, listening back isn't gonna work
01:17:51 because you know what it's supposed to say,
01:17:53 so you hear it, ask someone else to listen it for you.
01:17:55 You know, that's a better suggestion.
01:17:57 If you're not sure, yeah, get a second opinion.
01:18:00 Because some people I know,
01:18:01 they'll like play something on a speaker
01:18:03 and hold it up to their microphone
01:18:04 and it gets more distorted or things of this nature.
01:18:07 I know there are some ways around it
01:18:09 that some people around here discuss.
01:18:11 So this is just one of these public service announcements.
01:18:13 If it's unintelligible, even if it sounds potentially good,
01:18:16 obviously it's gonna be an issue for playing on the show.
01:18:19 It's actually bad.
01:18:21 It's actually not quality.
01:18:25 Well, I mean, that's it, that's our last voicemail.
01:18:27 Wait, really?
01:18:29 Yeah, I mean, there was just a couple today.
01:18:31 We've only gone, we're only on an hour and 18.
01:18:34 Uh-oh, stall for time, stall for time.
01:18:36 Only an hour.
01:18:37 Oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry, I skipped one.
01:18:38 I did actually skip one, now that I look at it, whoops.
01:18:41 Oh, it better be a good one.
01:18:42 It's gonna be a 40 minute voicemail.
01:18:43 Save us.
01:18:46 Oh, it's 100% not, it's, no, it's not.
01:18:50 This is another kind of, okay,
01:18:52 let me just fucking play it, all right, here you go.
01:18:54 It's voicemail guide redemption, go.
01:18:56 What's up, voicemail guide, try to make it quick.
01:18:59 Okay, look, I don't think it's very fair
01:19:00 that you're giving other people a chance
01:19:02 to start arcs and finish their arcs
01:19:03 when you're not willing to finish mine.
01:19:05 If I just want some redemption,
01:19:06 can you please finish my arc?
01:19:07 Guess who I am, Hippo, Nate, Ben.
01:19:10 Oh my God.
01:19:11 The most you guys could know me.
01:19:13 Your other hint is Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts, okay?
01:19:16 It'll all make sense in due time.
01:19:18 Are you Keyblade Spirit?
01:19:20 I don't fucking know, that could be you.
01:19:22 It definitely could be you, but listen to the entitlement.
01:19:24 Once again, it's not fair you finish other people's arcs.
01:19:27 Okay, you know what?
01:19:28 I'll give you that.
01:19:29 Keyblade Spirit is a good guess,
01:19:32 like I have no other guess beside that,
01:19:35 so I'm just gonna go with it.
01:19:36 Are you Keyblade Spirit?
01:19:38 There you go, but, I mean,
01:19:40 you must certainly understand a fair voicemail guide.
01:19:44 Oh, hey, you know what?
01:19:45 You know what happened?
01:19:45 Yeah.
01:19:46 Something funny happened in, it was during slime fest.
01:19:49 Oh, wait, you know what, I wanna say something.
01:19:52 People don't know.
01:19:54 Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers is on a new channel.
01:19:56 Oh, that's right, that's right.
01:19:57 And the newest episode, like the full, like real episode,
01:20:00 not a Twitch VOD re-uploaded,
01:20:02 but like an actual, like me and Munchy sit down
01:20:04 and make like a three hour long actual RFCK episode
01:20:07 is up and is the most recent video
01:20:10 on the Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers channel.
01:20:12 And it's only got like 400 views,
01:20:13 and I think a lot of people just don't know it's there.
01:20:15 But it is.
01:20:16 Yeah, I think you're right.
01:20:17 We've moved to a new channel,
01:20:18 link in the description for that.
01:20:20 Okay, actually.
01:20:21 Speaking of Munchy, did he ever explain himself to you
01:20:24 why he called you?
01:20:24 Oh, yes, he did.
01:20:25 He said, oops, I didn't mean to call you,
01:20:28 but I did mean to ask if I got clearance
01:20:30 to listen to Storm Before the Storm,
01:20:33 which is a book we were talking about
01:20:35 that I did listen to on Audible,
01:20:37 but I was gonna listen to it again,
01:20:39 but I think he wants to do it.
01:20:40 And yeah, I'm not re-listening to this.
01:20:42 So the answer was yes.
01:20:44 Word.
01:20:45 Yes, been listening to books.
01:20:47 So it was streaming.
01:20:49 We were streaming Slime Fest yesterday.
01:20:51 And at the end, at the very end of it, spoiler alert,
01:20:55 I won the moral victory, as always.
01:20:58 Way to go, which is another way of saying
01:21:00 of losing the actual competition.
01:21:02 That's not true.
01:21:03 That's just not true.
01:21:04 It's all in how you look at it.
01:21:04 Okay, understood.
01:21:05 Victory is a social construct.
01:21:07 And so at the very end,
01:21:09 we were talking about what the next contest would be,
01:21:12 and I said a karaoke contest,
01:21:15 and I was reminded of the karaoke contest
01:21:17 between Christine Weston-Chandler and Solid Chris
01:21:21 and Liquid Chris, when Chris challenged Liquid
01:21:24 to a Singstar karaoke contest
01:21:26 to determine who was the real Chris.
01:21:28 And I said this, and then I went back to record,
01:21:33 what's the word, to make the VOD,
01:21:35 to highlight the VOD, so it'd be saved.
01:21:37 And I see at the very end, after I said that,
01:21:40 Chris appears in chat to say,
01:21:43 like, hmm, a karaoke contest is to say,
01:21:46 who's who, sounds a little too familiar.
01:21:48 Lol.
01:21:49 And I was like, lol, she heard me say the whole thing.
01:21:52 That's hilarious.
01:21:53 I think that was the only comment she made.
01:21:55 She just shows up to my streams now.
01:21:57 It's pretty funny.
01:21:58 I mean, yeah, clearly invested in the narrative
01:22:00 to some degree.
01:22:01 It's pretty funny.
01:22:02 I've been a little slower
01:22:04 on the slime and punishment updates lately,
01:22:05 but I've got a couple in the can ready to go,
01:22:09 maybe later today or tomorrow.
01:22:10 Sick, sick.
01:22:12 I've been checking your feed, looking for him regularly,
01:22:14 so you've got at least one person.
01:22:16 You've got at least one person who gives the fuck.
01:22:19 I'm really looking forward to it.
01:22:21 I mean, I'm not gonna lie,
01:22:21 I'm held in out for that keg standard cameo.
01:22:24 Although I did see him in, what was it,
01:22:27 Phantom Point was like thinking about something,
01:22:28 and then he had a little thought bubble of a...
01:22:30 Yeah, he's talking to Dupati and Tupati,
01:22:35 and he's talking about the importance of,
01:22:37 today I learned about the importance of loving your brother,
01:22:40 even when you don't always get a long line crib
01:22:43 directly from Friendship is Witchcraft.
01:22:47 Oh yeah.
01:22:48 I think, I guess it won't spoil too much.
01:22:51 I think there will probably be a keg cameo in the epilogue.
01:22:57 Sure, seems understandable.
01:22:58 I think that would be an appropriate time for it.
01:23:01 Hey, as long as it's appropriate.
01:23:03 Yeah.
01:23:04 No interference here with the artistic process.
01:23:06 Yeah, and I won't say in what context,
01:23:09 but that's a tentative plan.
01:23:12 So guys, you can all put down your pitchforks,
01:23:14 your favorite character, just give it a little time.
01:23:17 All these bullshit meme side characters,
01:23:19 they'll get out of the way soon.
01:23:20 I'm really looking forward to having it done,
01:23:23 because I feel like when I say, guys, it's done, it's finished.
01:23:25 I feel like that's the point when a lot of people will be like,
01:23:28 oh, okay, if it's actually done,
01:23:30 then maybe I'll go back and read it.
01:23:31 Because that's what I did with Balejap.
01:23:34 Like when Hippo said, like, oh yeah,
01:23:35 I just released the finale, it's over.
01:23:37 I was like, oh shit, I guess I gotta read it now.
01:23:40 And I did.
01:23:41 People love a finished product.
01:23:43 Yeah.
01:23:43 Yeah.
01:23:44 Speaking of finished products,
01:23:46 we should show them the new bonus episode,
01:23:49 because it's good or so.
01:23:51 Oh, you know, I'm so glad you mentioned that.
01:23:53 Yeah, maybe I would remember it at the end.
01:23:55 But yeah, the new bonus episode is,
01:23:57 the day of recording, I'll be releasing it after we're done.
01:24:00 And it's game development,
01:24:01 and there's a whole bunch of links to games we've made,
01:24:04 including the ones we mentioned before.
01:24:06 There's my little demo, I made it with my buddy John.
01:24:09 I've untitled Music Jumper, featuring QT Bass Drop.
01:24:13 There's the, of course, the Izumi game stuff
01:24:14 is linked in there.
01:24:16 Mage has some works,
01:24:17 some artwork from various projects.
01:24:20 Other things too.
01:24:21 The Saint Comics, the champion game,
01:24:23 which has just been up on SaintComics.com the whole time.
01:24:26 But I linked that too, I guess.
01:24:29 Indeed, indeed.
01:24:30 Also a game.
01:24:31 A world game bell I made with my buddy Rich back in the day
01:24:33 in college, that was a good time too.
01:24:35 An endless war.
01:24:39 Slime game.
01:24:40 If you could call it a game.
01:24:41 Slime game, not a lifestyle.
01:24:42 It's more of a lifestyle choice, yeah.
01:24:48 All right, we've delayed long enough.
01:24:50 We can wrap it up here, I think, boys and girls.
01:24:53 That's, we've done our due diligence.
01:24:55 We won't torment you any longer.
01:24:57 So let's see what's going on.
01:24:58 Of course, patreon.com slash the procrastinators
01:25:01 is always going on.
01:25:03 It's the hip-hoppin' in place
01:25:04 for all your social media updates
01:25:06 and currency draining exchanges.
01:25:08 If you're on the Discord server,
01:25:11 you don't even need Twitter anymore.
01:25:12 It's just outdated that.
01:25:13 Yeah, get off Twitter and get in the PCP Discord.
01:25:16 That's it.
01:25:17 Very true.
01:25:18 That's what it's about.
01:25:19 It's better, anyway.
01:25:21 Oh, you know, the other day, someone in your Discord bed,
01:25:24 first of all, they added me.
01:25:26 They added me specifically.
01:25:28 I just said like some, I mean, in my opinion,
01:25:31 it was horrific bullshit, but I mean,
01:25:33 the way that I read it, I won't say their name
01:25:36 because we made peace.
01:25:37 But it sounded like what this person's point was,
01:25:40 like, hey, Nate, just so you know,
01:25:41 like everything you've ever done
01:25:43 is like a pale shadow of Digi and you're pathetic
01:25:46 and I don't respect you.
01:25:47 Oh, wow.
01:25:48 I mean, okay.
01:25:49 I'm exaggerating for comedic effect right now,
01:25:51 but that was kind of the gist of what I read into it.
01:25:54 What actually, as we, so I got very angry,
01:25:58 but as we teased it out, their point seemed more to be,
01:26:01 hey, Nate, I don't actually think content
01:26:03 is the best use of your time
01:26:05 and would prefer you to do like your big videos.
01:26:08 And well, okay, just say that then.
01:26:11 Yeah, that's a very different statement, right?
01:26:14 But if they just said that,
01:26:15 they wouldn't make you mad and get a response out of you.
01:26:18 Oh my God, you've cracked the code.
01:26:20 That's very true.
01:26:21 That's, you know, that's true.
01:26:23 Well, it's all right.
01:26:24 It's all right.
01:26:25 Interpreted better and all is well.
01:26:28 What were we talking about?
01:26:29 Oh yes, of course, money, patreon.com
01:26:31 slash the procrastinators, $5 bonus episodes,
01:26:34 game dev one, actually a good bonus episode, guys.
01:26:36 Actually a good one.
01:26:37 What do you mean?
01:26:38 They're all gems.
01:26:39 I don't know what you're talking about.
01:26:40 They're all gems, but some sparkle more than others.
01:26:42 Well, most of them are gems in the rough,
01:26:44 so just lumps of coal,
01:26:45 but this one is actually a semi-formed one.
01:26:49 This one's particularly good.
01:26:50 So we all have experience projects to share.
01:26:52 Indeed, indeed.
01:26:54 And go listen to that.
01:26:55 End of the 31 other episodes,
01:26:56 32 total of the bonus episodes
01:26:58 for the low, low fee of $5 on the Patreon.
01:27:01 $1, you're in the bonus, not the bonus,
01:27:03 the PCB discord, the patron discord.
01:27:05 Good times, be there, obviously, as you said before.
01:27:08 And more, hey, as much as you want.
01:27:10 You could also go give $5 a month
01:27:11 to the PCP Minecraft server if you want as well.
01:27:14 Play Minecraft with us.
01:27:15 We got a stream coming up.
01:27:17 I think right now we have it scheduled
01:27:18 for Friday, December the 13th.
01:27:21 So keep an eye out for that if you wanna play,
01:27:23 so we will be there around then sometime in December.
01:27:26 And what else is going on?
01:27:28 At TPCrasnators on Twitter,
01:27:30 updates and whatnot, retweets, et cetera, et cetera.
01:27:32 And, of course, Speakpipe, leave more voicemails
01:27:36 so that we can respond to them here on the show.
01:27:38 Thanks, everybody for doing that.
01:27:39 Voicemail God, I forgive you.
01:27:40 All right, we'll see you next week, everybody.
01:27:44 And there it is, character art concluded.
01:27:46 Forgiveness, redemption.
01:27:49 All right, see you next week, everybody.
01:27:51 Bye.
01:27:52 Bye, thank you.
