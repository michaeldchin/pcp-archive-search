00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:05 TPC, PCP, that is what I want for me, and welcome back. I'm the best guy ever, and we're joined by Hippocrit.
00:00:15 Hey, the SleepTight Bandcamp is up, and you can get the Gay for a Day album right now over on sleeptight.bandcamp.com. Link in the description.
00:00:26 I listened to it. It was a heck of a time.
00:00:29 We got Munchy. It sounds better than the live one. True.
00:00:32 You know, guys, I was having like a really good day today. Like, you know, like I woke up in my bed, just to further clarify, my race car bed.
00:00:39 And like, I just looked around my beautiful room full of posters of bitches, all legs spread.
00:00:44 And I came up the starting gate knowing it was going to be another great day being straight.
00:00:48 But what's this I see in my Discord? Oh, it's the PCP? Oh, I'm feeling a little bit gay, guys.
00:00:54 I'm a little bit like, homosexual right now. Oh, God, I think I might be turning gay for a day right now in this Discord call.
00:01:04 Major cringe, my dude. Major cringe. We've got Tom Oliver.
00:01:09 Look, as somebody who's gay every day, I'm offended by the fact that you're taking my identity and leveraging it for fame and musical shenanigans.
00:01:17 Unbelievable fame.
00:01:19 I suspect you're a gay trender, Munchy. A mere gay trender.
00:01:23 I know. It's fashionable to be gay right now, so I'm doing it. I mean, if it were fashionable to wear the color red, you would do so.
00:01:30 I do want to give it a deep look. I'm red for a day.
00:01:32 You're going to be sleeping tight in your grave when I'm through.
00:01:34 Oh, dude, I'm red for a day. I say turn into bin sain, except I never become not bin sain.
00:01:40 There he is, Ben.
00:01:41 Oh, yes. And hey, guess what? If you're listening right now, the next episode of Grimp is out. I'll link that in the description.
00:01:52 Go listen to Grimp, too.
00:01:54 What does Grimp mean? Is there a meaning behind that?
00:01:56 Wouldn't you like to know?
00:01:58 Oh, I dearly would, but I never will.
00:02:01 Yeah, that's right.
00:02:03 If I listen, will I find out?
00:02:05 You'll just have to listen and find out whether you'll find out.
00:02:10 I guess that's true.
00:02:12 Damn, that's double-layer marketing.
00:02:14 I also have a thing to say, so it's not out yet, but okay, here's a larger subject.
00:02:20 So it's just that, no, this is all good, and you'll be probably happy slash excited to hear it.
00:02:26 It's just that I am currently working on a project with one, my work is done.
00:02:31 I have a not nearly as much work as he does.
00:02:33 Best anime ever goes in the shell? Yeah, we know. You've been working on it for like five years.
00:02:36 No, no, no, not that. I'm working on something with one Nexus Mania artist, professional human being.
00:02:45 He makes his living being a human being.
00:02:47 If you haven't read them, they're comics by Nexus Mania and they're fucking good.
00:02:51 Yes, he is very talented. He does animation stuff.
00:02:54 He did a couple of things for, like, he did the Weagua opening animation I used at one point.
00:02:59 I know him for the cork-cursed background.
00:03:03 Very true, very true. He does the art for the podcast most of the time.
00:03:07 Now, I was very explicit. We've been talking about a project of his for a long time,
00:03:13 and I clarified what I'm allowed to say because a lot of it's secret, but I am doing voice acting.
00:03:18 This is an actual voice acting gig. I will be receiving money for this work, which is very exciting.
00:03:24 And my part's all done. There's other bits left to be done. It's a pretty big animation project.
00:03:31 It is an animation that Nexus is doing. I'm extremely excited about it.
00:03:35 I think it's going to be dope as hell. Script is pretty sick, pretty tight, and it's got me as the only people who matter.
00:03:43 Can we have a hint as to what the nature of this animation is?
00:03:48 I don't think I'm supposed to say even any details as to what the story is about or who's involved with it.
00:03:57 Is it like an anime OP? Is it like a music video or is it like a show?
00:04:03 It's like its own little contained story of Nexus's that he wrote and he's been working on.
00:04:11 It's its own thing, but it's very funny, it's very meta, it's very cool,
00:04:15 and I have no doubt that the animation will be stellar when it's complete.
00:04:19 It's pretty short, probably only going to be like, I don't know, less than maybe like five minutes long.
00:04:24 But for an animation, that's pretty sizable.
00:04:27 I know this probably isn't it, but being a huge fan of Bunny Wave, I kind of wish it was the date that's going to happen in the arc of Bunny Wave
00:04:35 and you were voicing Max, the fucking cringelord guy who tries to be really cocky and popular at school,
00:04:41 but he's actually super insecure, which is basically you anyways.
00:04:45 Bunny also kind of shares that, but yeah, true, but I won't even say if it's that or not,
00:04:52 but it's something and it's coming in by the end of August, I think it's the deadline.
00:04:57 By the end of August sometime, that'll be out and I could not be more excited about it.
00:05:01 Love you Nexus, keep up the good work, thanks for the money.
00:05:04 Well, as we all know, anything that's talked about in the PCP by Nate doesn't come out, so...
00:05:08 That's like six weeks away.
00:05:10 I know, I know, he's got a lot of work ahead.
00:05:13 Alright, well Grimp is out now, and guess what?
00:05:16 The topic, yeah, so what's two in the hand, one in the bush, whatever.
00:05:21 And the topic is, should we, aka Grimp, talk about politics?
00:05:27 So there you go.
00:05:29 We can keep it contained, yeah, we can keep it quarantined.
00:05:32 A discussion about if you even should discuss politics.
00:05:35 Yes, the question is should we.
00:05:37 I find that a relevant and interesting discussion.
00:05:40 Actually, that's a discussion I am interested in having in general.
00:05:44 Find out, find out what we conclude right now.
00:05:48 Unlike this fucking animation that will never happen.
00:05:52 Six weeks, the fucking world will have ended by then.
00:05:56 You know Nexus talks sometimes.
00:05:58 Climate change!
00:06:00 Yeah, oh fuck.
00:06:01 When I was talking to Nexus, he was just like, yeah, you know, just doing my work for, he does like...
00:06:05 I think it's called Dragon Ball R&R, which I shamefully have never actually checked out,
00:06:09 but apparently is good.
00:06:11 Nexus works on it, so I assume it is.
00:06:13 But he was just like, yeah, I just didn't sleep last night, just like worked all night.
00:06:17 I was like, oh, is that your life?
00:06:20 Sorry about that.
00:06:22 Maybe change, maybe do something differently.
00:06:25 That's a life of every artist who tries.
00:06:27 If you want to get anywhere in the world, you just have to give up.
00:06:29 You have to give up on having any life at all.
00:06:32 There's nothing in this world I hate more than staying up all night.
00:06:35 I hate it so much.
00:06:36 It's not that bad.
00:06:37 It's honestly not that bad.
00:06:39 No, that's just your youth buff.
00:06:41 I need to wear it out in about five years.
00:06:43 I need to hashtag sleep tight, if you know what I'm saying.
00:06:46 I have no idea what you're saying, in fact.
00:06:48 Listen, I've developed ever since...
00:06:50 I relate to you all the story of this war, ARG, that I worked tirelessly on throughout the nights.
00:06:57 And ever since then, my life...
00:06:59 The only thing that curbed this was Hippo, but before then, I was just staying up for a day,
00:07:04 then going up for another day.
00:07:06 So I would just be awake for 24 hours, if not more.
00:07:09 Sleep for 12 hours, 36 hours, 36 hours, just over and over and over again.
00:07:15 And that just was my life.
00:07:17 And you know what, honestly?
00:07:18 Pretty good. I liked it. It was pretty good.
00:07:20 It had a lot of fun.
00:07:21 I think staying up all night might be human core.
00:07:25 Yeah.
00:07:26 No.
00:07:27 And I think it's something that I'm guilty of.
00:07:29 Is that like post-human core?
00:07:31 Because you're deviating from our natural biological urges?
00:07:33 I think it's something that...
00:07:35 Well, I mean...
00:07:36 There was some discussion on Twitter about what is...
00:07:38 Being human core means you can deviate from what you're literally naturally inclined to do.
00:07:43 I mean, human core pertains to society, pertains to civilization.
00:07:47 Because the whole point of being a human is that you're not following animal instincts.
00:07:50 I would say staying up is human core.
00:07:53 Sleeping normal eight hours is animal core.
00:07:55 Okay, there was a debate between I'll die of I'll die corp and Dax tier on Twitter.
00:08:01 And Dax tier said human core is following your base instincts.
00:08:06 And I'll die said human core is what separates a human from the animal.
00:08:11 So it's the exact opposite of that.
00:08:13 Yeah.
00:08:14 And I'm more inclined to think that it is about base instincts.
00:08:17 But that's not all it is.
00:08:18 Because like tradition, following traditions and like culture,
00:08:23 like traditional culture is human core.
00:08:25 Like going to church is human core.
00:08:27 Is there like a social human core and a biological human core?
00:08:31 And agriculture is human core.
00:08:33 The way I use human core, and I speak as an authority as the most human core person on Earth,
00:08:38 I use human core as a distinctress from the animals.
00:08:42 You should buy my human core shirt available at teespring.com slash human core.
00:08:49 Which is why I say the two things that you have to do to become a human are
00:08:53 is own a dog and eat bed.
00:08:55 And also buy my shirt.
00:08:57 Also buy his shirt.
00:08:58 What if I eat rice instead of bread?
00:09:00 What if I'm an ass bread?
00:09:02 I think that's difficult.
00:09:04 Okay.
00:09:05 That's just another bread.
00:09:06 My onigiri and I'll chow down.
00:09:08 Rice is just lots of little loaves of bread.
00:09:10 Yeah.
00:09:11 Natural bread.
00:09:12 Oh, you know what?
00:09:13 Oh my God.
00:09:14 Okay, actually that launches me directly into the other thing I wanted to talk about today.
00:09:18 And you will love this.
00:09:19 Guys, be ready to salivate.
00:09:20 Be ready to jerk your own dick.
00:09:22 You know what?
00:09:23 Honestly, I don't think I will.
00:09:24 I do that every episode.
00:09:25 It's that.
00:09:26 Okay, so Michelle got like an Amazon prepared meal box dish.
00:09:31 A cured one from the ether.
00:09:33 And I personally 100% cooked that meal from start to finish.
00:09:38 And this was.
00:09:39 This was sale.
00:09:40 Is this just...
00:09:41 Yeah, go on.
00:09:42 Is this just...
00:09:43 So fresh for Amazon.
00:09:44 I was just gonna say, is this just Hello Fresh by another name?
00:09:46 That's exactly what this is.
00:09:47 Okay, then I won't explain my feelings about it because you are...
00:09:52 We know.
00:09:53 We have made them perfectly clear in the past.
00:09:55 All right.
00:09:56 But why is it an Amazon version of why not just go with Hello Fresh?
00:09:59 Well, I mean, because she got this for free.
00:10:02 This was free.
00:10:03 So like she just got it.
00:10:04 Because Amazon, having more money than anyone else, can corner every market and therefore
00:10:09 do everything cheaper than everyone else and therefore kill all competition.
00:10:12 Absolutely true.
00:10:13 That's what we call the free market.
00:10:16 That is one way that it operates, which is suboptimal.
00:10:20 Totally agree.
00:10:21 Totally agree.
00:10:22 But the point being, so it's basically Hello Fresh, just whatever.
00:10:26 Amazon variant.
00:10:27 It was like a sweet and spicy shrimp over, I think it was like...
00:10:34 What was the word?
00:10:37 Marbled couscous.
00:10:39 Something like that.
00:10:40 Marbled couscous.
00:10:41 It wasn't marbled.
00:10:42 It was like...
00:10:43 No, it was called fucking...
00:10:44 Oh, purled.
00:10:45 It was called over like seasoned purled couscous.
00:10:48 That's the word that they used.
00:10:50 What is purled?
00:10:51 It's like more spherical couscous.
00:10:53 I think it's made of rice couscous and it's like round...
00:10:56 No, it's basically just a rice.
00:10:58 Just think of it as rice.
00:10:59 Yeah, it's like the same thing.
00:11:01 Is it literally made from rice?
00:11:02 Is that accurate?
00:11:03 I don't think so.
00:11:04 It's functionally the same as rice.
00:11:06 Was it purled or pearl couscous?
00:11:09 I believe it said purled with a D, purled adjective.
00:11:13 Okay.
00:11:14 And okay, I don't know why, but okay.
00:11:16 This required me, your boy, BGE Nate,
00:11:19 literally the most human corpsman on the planet now.
00:11:22 Now that I've done this.
00:11:23 Okay, yes, sure.
00:11:24 I have...
00:11:25 You prepare two separate things.
00:11:27 On the one, you prepare this delicious multi-stage shrimp ragu
00:11:32 where you, individually, you grill the shrimp.
00:11:35 Nothing like a good ragu.
00:11:37 Oh, yeah, tell me about it.
00:11:38 You prepare the shrimp, you grill it, you move it aside,
00:11:40 then you put in all the vegetables,
00:11:43 you grill your onions, you grill your peppers,
00:11:45 you grill your various other things that were with that.
00:11:48 You pour on your seasonings and shit.
00:11:50 You cook all that, you marble it up real nice.
00:11:52 Then you pour in the tomato paste or whatever it is,
00:11:57 and then you stir all that together.
00:11:59 You make your ragu slop.
00:12:01 Then you re-add the fucking shrimp back into it,
00:12:04 which has already been cooked to perfection
00:12:06 and browned into a golden, crispy dream.
00:12:09 You warm that all up.
00:12:10 You put the shrimp back in, you warm it back up.
00:12:12 That's your ragu.
00:12:13 That's your ragu.
00:12:14 On the other side, you're preparing your couscous,
00:12:16 which is you put in a pot, you don't use water.
00:12:19 You use what was referred to as, I think it was called clam moisture.
00:12:23 No, no, it was like clam water or something like that.
00:12:26 What the fuck?
00:12:27 It was like clam juice or something like that.
00:12:29 It's the equivalent of using like a chicken stock or something.
00:12:31 Yeah, there I am.
00:12:32 Exactly.
00:12:33 There I am.
00:12:34 Fucking some Islander ride, some native Islander.
00:12:37 Yeah.
00:12:38 Plying my national trade, I dive deep into the coastal coral reefs
00:12:42 and I go down and I pick up clams and I bring them to the top
00:12:45 and I crack them open into a bucket
00:12:47 and I find the pearls within and I throw them in the garbage
00:12:49 and I squeeze out that sweet, sweet clam moisture.
00:12:52 That's where the money's at.
00:12:54 That's basically what happened.
00:12:56 So you pour in that stock or whatever,
00:12:59 you pour in the couscous, you just cook that
00:13:01 and that cooks down and absorbs all the water.
00:13:03 You just have this delicious little marbles of couscous.
00:13:06 And then I think what makes it, what did I say?
00:13:09 A pearl.
00:13:10 A pearl.
00:13:11 Is that you just pour in, like you just put butter,
00:13:13 like a little thing of butter that comes in there
00:13:15 and then you sprinkle like it's oregano.
00:13:17 I think it was oregano.
00:13:18 You just stir that and oh my god,
00:13:20 that was the most delicious looking, shiny little marbles of couscous
00:13:24 I've ever seen with the oregano all over it.
00:13:27 And then once those two separate things are cooked,
00:13:29 then you combine them in the bowls that you are serving with.
00:13:32 You put your couscous on the bottom,
00:13:33 10 out of 10 looks incredible,
00:13:35 and then you pour your shrimp ragu.
00:13:37 In the middle of two, it was, it was an absolutely
00:13:40 incredibly delicious meal.
00:13:42 But I would have traded it all away
00:13:45 for another 45 minutes of precious Minecraft playtime.
00:13:49 I could have gotten so many diamonds
00:13:51 instead of preparing this fucking meal.
00:13:53 I regret it so intensely.
00:13:55 I don't give a shit about food.
00:13:57 I want my Minecraft stats back.
00:13:59 I want, I could have been building a tower.
00:14:01 I could have been building sky towers
00:14:03 and connective shit, it's connective tissue
00:14:05 to make my world more optimal to optimize towards Starfleet.
00:14:08 What a fucking waste it was making this fucking meal,
00:14:12 even though it was like the best meal I've had
00:14:14 in the last six months or so.
00:14:15 So that was great.
00:14:16 The best meal you've had in six months.
00:14:18 Well, I went to like the best restaurant sincey,
00:14:20 that was better.
00:14:21 But like the best one I've had like at home,
00:14:23 and it was incredible.
00:14:24 It was delicious.
00:14:25 You've been pulling what you accused Digi of last episode,
00:14:27 which is just saying like the most basic things
00:14:30 of all time and then sounding like you've found out
00:14:32 like the secrets of the universe.
00:14:34 Like an unbrewable revolution about what's happening.
00:14:37 I describe in such glowing terms cooking,
00:14:39 and then I counter that by saying,
00:14:41 I wish I'd played Minecraft.
00:14:42 That's the joke.
00:14:44 And you, sir, are not recognizing the joke.
00:14:47 I understood that you wasted your time
00:14:49 because you don't know how to cook effectively,
00:14:51 because you're following this.
00:14:52 Well, I did cook effectively.
00:14:53 I did exactly what the recipe said.
00:14:55 This is this bullshit Amazon fucking
00:14:57 what are you talking about?
00:14:58 Fisher price, goddamn recipe.
00:15:00 This was the most efficient cooking process of all time.
00:15:04 Munchie, have you come over to my side
00:15:06 on the Hello Fresh issue?
00:15:07 No, well, okay, what I'm trying,
00:15:09 Ben, what I've said a thousand times is that I agree with you.
00:15:14 All I've ever said is that there is a reason
00:15:17 why some people would want to use Hello Fresh.
00:15:19 All I ever said, all you ever said,
00:15:23 don't tell me you don't have like your stock.
00:15:26 You don't have, you're not speculating in stock
00:15:28 in Hello Fresh right this second.
00:15:30 I, listen, I used to be a Hello Fresh person.
00:15:32 Convert all your Bitcoin to Hello Fresh stock.
00:15:34 And then I haven't needed Hello Fresh
00:15:36 in like six months, like Hello Fresh is dead to me.
00:15:39 I have no more use for it.
00:15:41 Okay, all right, good.
00:15:43 Hey guys, ready for this gem?
00:15:45 This was just commented.
00:15:46 Wait, wait, I want to say a little cooking story
00:15:49 because like, I'm not like, I don't do my research.
00:15:53 I don't study recipes.
00:15:55 I know how to cook very basic things.
00:15:56 I don't know things, I don't understand stuff
00:15:59 and I don't comprehend how I like it.
00:16:02 And I've been like, just sort of like,
00:16:05 passively being interested in cooking
00:16:08 because Munchie is also interested in it
00:16:10 and it's sort of like rubbing off of me.
00:16:11 Really?
00:16:12 Ooh, that's really nice to hear.
00:16:14 Yeah, just like through the past few months.
00:16:15 I mean, I know your guys would do it too.
00:16:17 Oh yeah, well the thing is dad cooks so much
00:16:19 that it's never really an issue for me to need to cook.
00:16:23 But I wanted to like learn how to just cook rice well.
00:16:26 And I try to make like,
00:16:30 this brand new invention called rice
00:16:33 with a fried egg on the top of it.
00:16:35 Oh, nice.
00:16:37 And I made a thing of rice and I had the rice
00:16:39 and I fried an egg and I fried it bad
00:16:42 and the yellow, the yolk cracked and then I just put it on top.
00:16:45 I think they call that recipe sunrise
00:16:48 over the sunrise kingdom.
00:16:51 That's like rice to pan, you know?
00:16:51 I'm pretty sure that is actually
00:16:53 like a real Japanese dish, fried egg on top of rice.
00:16:55 I think that's called moon over Miami.
00:16:56 Oh no, I've seen it in anime
00:16:59 and I've also eaten a bowl of rice and stuff
00:17:03 with an egg on top.
00:17:04 You know, when I was in college,
00:17:05 I just cracked a raw egg into a thing of rice.
00:17:07 It was like the most disgusting thing I've ever eaten,
00:17:09 but I've seen it in anime.
00:17:10 Because I saw it in anime and I was like, that makes sense.
00:17:13 If the rice is hot, then the egg will cook.
00:17:16 This did not cook.
00:17:17 Right, well, yeah, there's definitely a technique to it.
00:17:21 Yeah, I mean, if egg fried rice was easy to make,
00:17:25 I would make that. Oh, I love that.
00:17:26 That's good.
00:17:27 That's not even hard, dude.
00:17:28 It's not hard, but it requires like more
00:17:31 than just a frying pan and nothing else.
00:17:35 Well, I mean a bowl, but like, that was my cooking story.
00:17:39 I just made a rice and put egg on it
00:17:41 and I didn't have the runny yolk,
00:17:43 so it was kind of lame and boring and I ate all of it.
00:17:45 But, you know, it didn't take very long
00:17:48 and I got some, you know, some energy from it.
00:17:50 So I don't even think it was that bad.
00:17:52 Dude, think about how many diamonds
00:17:54 you could have gotten instead of doing that.
00:17:56 I want to circle back to Nate here,
00:17:58 because I mean, I believe that everyone
00:18:01 can benefit from cooking in some way.
00:18:03 And then I think that what you're doing
00:18:05 is not the way that cooking can benefit you, Nate,
00:18:08 because it's not about, there's no one way to cook, right?
00:18:12 There's no one benefit you get from it.
00:18:14 And so the idea of being able to, you know,
00:18:17 perfectly make the exact, you know, fancy meal
00:18:20 and take all fucking day to do,
00:18:22 that's not what would appeal to you or benefit you in any way.
00:18:25 Well, you could see that would benefit you,
00:18:27 is there are recipes and there are ways to cook
00:18:30 and just make food that are far faster, far cheaper,
00:18:34 and also able to be far more healthy
00:18:37 than getting alternatives, like ordering in,
00:18:39 or, you know, or getting delivery.
00:18:41 I'll stop you right there, Munch,
00:18:43 because you're absolutely right.
00:18:44 And my boy Scooby, fitness God,
00:18:46 has an extensive series about him
00:18:49 who can barely cook at all,
00:18:50 but he has tons of like fitness-oriented meals
00:18:53 that they take like five minutes to make
00:18:55 and they are delicious
00:18:56 and eating out is a waste of money and mostly money,
00:19:00 and you shouldn't do it pretty much ever.
00:19:02 So I couldn't agree more,
00:19:03 and that's the kind of shit that,
00:19:04 when I was at my physical peak,
00:19:06 I was cooking myself those kind of meals,
00:19:08 like, I mean, every single day,
00:19:10 I made my own food and stuff.
00:19:11 That's a great segue.
00:19:12 I just want to do it too.
00:19:16 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:19:19 Okay, sorry.
00:19:20 Then wait your turn.
00:19:22 I was just going to say like the whole rice thing.
00:19:25 I feel like I'm going on like a very slow,
00:19:27 like inefficiently slow journey of discovery,
00:19:30 because a few weeks ago,
00:19:32 I did a bowl of rice with some baked beans in it,
00:19:35 and the baked bean juice was really nice.
00:19:38 Earlier than that, I did just a bowl of rice,
00:19:40 and I was like, there's not enough flavor.
00:19:41 So I've been adding, you know, one thing at a time,
00:19:44 learning how to do like very basic baby shit,
00:19:47 but each time it's still a whole bowl of rice,
00:19:49 and that's like very filling.
00:19:51 So if you want to like cook without a lot of like prep
00:19:55 or like hassle, you know, you like beans,
00:20:00 just do a beans and rice thing,
00:20:02 and learn how to make it really efficiently,
00:20:04 and then maybe make it in bulk,
00:20:05 and then just reheat it.
00:20:06 Make it in bulk.
00:20:07 Oh, dude, okay, speaking of making it in bulk here,
00:20:10 hippo, I've got your next big target here.
00:20:13 I've got like a bounty for you,
00:20:15 putting down a wanted for risotto.
00:20:17 If you're being like a rice god,
00:20:19 if that's the new way that you're taking your life,
00:20:21 make a risotto because it is delicious,
00:20:24 and it is risotto.
00:20:27 It is an Italian dish that you probably have heard of.
00:20:31 I've heard of it.
00:20:33 And it is delicious.
00:20:34 Dude, risotto, just like in the movies.
00:20:37 Literally.
00:20:38 Me and a guy, me and a guy, I used to know,
00:20:40 we had a little running joke between us,
00:20:43 and the running joke was simply that when we saw Pepsi,
00:20:46 we would say, wow, Pepsi, just like in the movie.
00:20:49 That's a pretty good joke.
00:20:52 Those are rich folks in their Pepsi in the movies.
00:20:56 Dude, yeah.
00:20:57 Okay, speaking of bulk,
00:21:00 and also being at your physical peak,
00:21:02 I'm lifting again for real.
00:21:04 I've heard all about it.
00:21:06 I'm squatting and deadlifting and going nuts,
00:21:08 and I think I've done like three workouts so far,
00:21:13 and that's enough to establish a pattern.
00:21:15 Three is a pattern.
00:21:17 I'm so fucking jealous of you.
00:21:19 I was doing so good with my fucking working out
00:21:22 before my spine broke into pieces.
00:21:24 That's understandable.
00:21:25 I was doing so bad with it.
00:21:28 I feel...
00:21:29 Until Tom's spine broke, and then you got inspired.
00:21:31 You're still my juju, you bastard.
00:21:33 Yeah, yeah.
00:21:34 I was, you know, well, haha.
00:21:39 There could only be one fit person.
00:21:41 I have to break this guy's spine.
00:21:43 What about Nate?
00:21:44 Yes, you had more to gain from killing Nate than killing me.
00:21:47 Nate just like looks at it.
00:21:49 Nate lives further away, therefore.
00:21:50 I'm a cream puff.
00:21:51 I'm all flash, no substance.
00:21:53 Nate's the final boss.
00:21:54 You have to like...
00:21:56 Ben's like Goku.
00:21:57 He wants to fight Frieza at his highest power,
00:21:59 so he has to let Nate stay strong.
00:22:02 Yes.
00:22:03 We're going to get the fat Nate song.
00:22:05 That's what I'm waiting for.
00:22:06 It's never going to happen.
00:22:07 I dream of the day.
00:22:08 I got lads.
00:22:09 I've been tracking my calories like a hawk
00:22:11 the last two weeks.
00:22:12 I'm down roughly four pounds or so,
00:22:15 and it's just smooth sailing down to my...
00:22:17 I will look like a god when I'm at my 170th target.
00:22:19 I'm just the perpetual flab fag at this point.
00:22:21 I just can't fix it.
00:22:23 You will lower your calories, I guess, Starve?
00:22:27 Just, okay.
00:22:28 Let me just clarify.
00:22:30 If you actually have a calorie target people out there
00:22:33 that think it's so hard to not eat right,
00:22:34 let the...
00:22:35 Calories is the big, the cheap way.
00:22:37 Just like eat your calories.
00:22:39 It's all you got to do.
00:22:40 Just track what you eat in one day.
00:22:42 You will instantly in one day be like,
00:22:44 wow, I'm sure fucking up, and then it's so easy.
00:22:47 Once you understand what you're dealing with,
00:22:49 you'll be like, oh, I can easily not eat that.
00:22:51 I'll just eat this instead.
00:22:52 Once you do that, that's why the whatever diet
00:22:55 is so powerful.
00:22:56 It just makes you aware.
00:22:57 Being conscious is the most important thing.
00:22:59 I have a general question about that.
00:23:00 Just don't eat bulk grains.
00:23:02 Even if you're not keto, right?
00:23:04 I mean, I like keto, but even if you don't want to go
00:23:07 full keto, stop eating bulk grains.
00:23:08 Stop eating bread, stop eating rice.
00:23:10 I'm never doing this again,
00:23:12 pretty much for the rest of my life.
00:23:13 I would just be like, hey, I'm hungry.
00:23:15 Oh, a loaf of bread.
00:23:16 I could, one of the things I'll do,
00:23:17 I'll just eat pieces raw.
00:23:19 I'll just do that for a while.
00:23:21 I'll make bread or toast.
00:23:22 That's a great snack, right?
00:23:23 It's so easy to just eat an infinite amount
00:23:26 of cereal or bread or stuff like that.
00:23:30 Carbs are my bane, absolutely.
00:23:31 Bread was the peasant food,
00:23:33 and the bourgeois created it to keep the peasants down,
00:23:35 keep them weak, keep them fat, keep them dying.
00:23:37 Let them eat cake, let them eat bread,
00:23:39 basically the same thing.
00:23:41 Swear to God, it's true.
00:23:43 I've said it before, grains are not the thing
00:23:46 that humans evolve to eat.
00:23:48 Grains are a thing that were invented later
00:23:50 after the onset of large civilizations
00:23:54 because they are not the most nutritious thing,
00:23:58 but they are the most effective way
00:23:59 to feed a large population,
00:24:01 but they're not the healthiest thing
00:24:02 on an individual level.
00:24:04 Seems reasonable.
00:24:05 A question about tracking calories.
00:24:08 Yeah.
00:24:09 Say you eat a sandwich.
00:24:11 Do you have to count how many slices of ham
00:24:14 or gauge how much butter you put on
00:24:17 and then check the packaging
00:24:18 and then divide it by a certain amount?
00:24:20 Because that seems like it's gonna be difficult.
00:24:23 Can you count?
00:24:24 Can you count?
00:24:25 Then it's not that hard.
00:24:27 No, no, no, look, look, look.
00:24:28 We live in a civilized age.
00:24:29 We don't need to fucking do math manually anymore.
00:24:33 If you just get my fitness pounds, an app,
00:24:36 you just type in ham sandwich,
00:24:37 it has a ham sandwich there,
00:24:38 and it gives you the baseline of what it would be,
00:24:41 and you can ballpark it pretty reasonably
00:24:42 just by saying, oh, I have a ham sandwich,
00:24:44 it's just there, you click it,
00:24:45 it tells you what's in it, and you're good.
00:24:47 The thing that always gets me about the idea of that,
00:24:52 because I've never tried,
00:24:53 is just like you eat one sweet thing
00:24:57 out of a packet of sweet things,
00:24:59 and you have to check the packet
00:25:01 and then divide by the number
00:25:02 of the maximum sweet things in there.
00:25:03 Well, what's cool with my fitness pow is that you can,
00:25:08 let's say you get like a thing of Swedish fish
00:25:09 or something, like in this example,
00:25:11 you can use your phone,
00:25:13 scan the barcode of the box of Swedish fish,
00:25:16 and it'll bring up the information,
00:25:17 and then you can pick the serving size.
00:25:19 If you had one fish, one serving, or one container,
00:25:21 and then it'll do the math for you.
00:25:23 I didn't know about that, that's cool.
00:25:24 See, knowing that would make it much easier
00:25:27 for me to start if I were to need to do that.
00:25:30 Yet, my fitness pow, there's a reason
00:25:31 Jack's Blade has been logged in
00:25:32 for like 2,000 days in a row.
00:25:34 Fan?
00:25:35 Oh my God, that's incredible.
00:25:37 I'm in a streak of probably maybe two weeks,
00:25:39 maybe a little bit more right now.
00:25:40 It's about the same.
00:25:42 I'm just saying, I'm doing pretty good.
00:25:44 That's all, Bunchy.
00:25:45 I'm not trying to fight you, but now I am.
00:25:48 Oh man.
00:25:52 Ah, cheese guy, cheese.
00:25:56 Well, you know, things are going well for me.
00:25:59 I'm doing good.
00:26:00 I haven't been working out as much as I need to,
00:26:01 but I'm getting better every day.
00:26:03 I believe in myself.
00:26:04 And I'm gonna do it.
00:26:05 This is nice.
00:26:06 There's a fitness air in the air.
00:26:08 There's a miasma of health.
00:26:10 Just sort of permeating around.
00:26:12 This is a fact.
00:26:13 If you live in a place where people
00:26:15 are health conscious in general,
00:26:17 you just will gravitate towards like the mean
00:26:20 of what that lifestyle is like.
00:26:22 Like if you live in California,
00:26:23 I guarantee you are in 10 times better shape
00:26:26 than if you just live in Ohio.
00:26:27 I mean, like I've said before,
00:26:28 the Ohio staple of diet is chili with cheese equivalent
00:26:32 to the amount of chili underneath it,
00:26:34 at least in terms of volume.
00:26:36 Cheese is fucked up.
00:26:37 Yeah, it is fucked up.
00:26:39 I think I just had a heart attack listening to that sentence.
00:26:40 It's piled with cheese in this fucking city.
00:26:43 It's fucked up.
00:26:44 Dude.
00:26:45 Shouldn't be that way.
00:26:46 It's keto, man.
00:26:47 I, yeah, it's keto.
00:26:49 I bought, yesterday I bought a no joke,
00:26:52 like seven pounds of cheese.
00:26:54 And I ate it all right then.
00:26:57 Well, okay, there you go.
00:26:58 There you go.
00:26:59 Cheese is fired on keto,
00:27:00 but if you're not burning the fat
00:27:02 and just storing it, you're fucked.
00:27:04 But you should be exercising.
00:27:05 I was traveling out of state,
00:27:07 I forget where I was, I think it was in Nevada somewhere.
00:27:09 And I ordered just like a side of broccoli
00:27:12 because I wasn't very hungry.
00:27:13 I didn't want to partake in whatever fried shit was happening.
00:27:15 So I ordered broccoli and it came back
00:27:18 just covered in like cheeses.
00:27:21 Broccoli and cheese, yeah.
00:27:22 But like the reason I eat broccoli
00:27:25 is because it makes my body feel good.
00:27:28 When I eat cheese, it doesn't make me feel,
00:27:30 like what's the point of this then?
00:27:31 There is no problem.
00:27:33 I don't understand, what's wrong with cheese?
00:27:36 There's nothing wrong, I love cheese.
00:27:37 It's just that-
00:27:38 Well, much is probably getting enough calories already.
00:27:40 He's trying to eat a low calorie thing, I assume.
00:27:41 Well, I mean, it's exactly-
00:27:43 Cheese is good on keto, but if you're not on keto
00:27:45 and you're not in ketosis and you're not burning fat,
00:27:47 you're just-
00:27:48 Then you're fucking up.
00:27:49 Then you're making a mistake.
00:27:50 But in this Pacific scenario,
00:27:52 of course the cheese is a bad thing.
00:27:56 I used to be like that.
00:27:58 I used to be in the dark.
00:27:59 Oh, I'm like that again.
00:28:00 And then I used to be in the dark,
00:28:02 watching the shadows, watching shadow puppets on the wall
00:28:05 until someone brought me out into the light
00:28:07 and I saw the sun.
00:28:08 And now I'm coming back into that cave
00:28:10 to drag you all out to show you truth.
00:28:12 People including me have such a thought in their head
00:28:16 when you're not on the wagon,
00:28:18 as to how incredibly hard any of this stuff is,
00:28:21 like losing weight and again,
00:28:22 I might fuck up and I'm tempted constantly by things.
00:28:25 Not every day has been perfect.
00:28:26 I go over my calorie count every once in a while.
00:28:28 But like, if you just put a little bit of effort in it,
00:28:31 this is just tracking your calories.
00:28:34 I understand, a lot of people are so,
00:28:36 as we've learned in this call,
00:28:37 pathetically ignorant about calorie counting
00:28:40 and how to manage-
00:28:41 Wait, who are you talking about?
00:28:42 You, Ben, you.
00:28:43 What?
00:28:44 What do you mean?
00:28:45 I thought I thought you were talking about me.
00:28:46 Not actually you.
00:28:47 You just didn't know something
00:28:47 about my fitness pal that's totally understandable.
00:28:50 But like, people don't know.
00:28:51 That's such a cool feature.
00:28:52 As was evidenced in this call,
00:28:54 that like, if you look at the nutrition facts
00:28:56 on the back of like, for example, a loaf of bread,
00:28:58 people think like, oh, it's so hard to track.
00:29:00 But on that nutrition label, it says,
00:29:03 like what it does is it divvies it up by serving
00:29:06 and it tells you what a serving is,
00:29:07 like one piece of bread.
00:29:09 If you eat a sandwich, that's two pieces of bread.
00:29:11 You just know that's two servings of like 100 calories.
00:29:14 It's so easy to track.
00:29:16 I have developed a sense.
00:29:17 I have developed like a pretty good sense of like,
00:29:20 like I can judge a tablespoon of butter by eye
00:29:24 for example, stuff like that.
00:29:25 I just kind of know.
00:29:26 I just know which things have carbs in them and which don't.
00:29:30 I don't have to look at the label.
00:29:32 The hardest part though, by far, is getting started.
00:29:34 That's where 99% of people have their issues.
00:29:37 It's that 80-20 rule.
00:29:39 You're gonna get, you get the most benefit
00:29:40 out of that first 20%.
00:29:42 You just like a little, even a little effort
00:29:45 in anything, in this, like in anything else,
00:29:48 goes a long way.
00:29:49 And like, I don't know, like the keto work for you,
00:29:52 that's fantastic.
00:29:53 But for me, just counting my calories,
00:29:55 I've lost like four pounds in about two weeks.
00:29:58 And you know, I'm sure it's not perfect.
00:29:59 These things fluctuate, but it really works.
00:30:02 And I'm gonna keep doing it for the next couple of months
00:30:05 until I'm perfect and then I'll focus on like bulking,
00:30:07 to gain more muscle and stuff.
00:30:08 It's honestly really fucking easy.
00:30:11 If you just are, get my fitness pal.
00:30:13 If you care about this, do that.
00:30:15 Try tracking your calories for one day, for one day.
00:30:19 It's not hard.
00:30:20 It has all the tools you need.
00:30:22 And track your progress.
00:30:23 Arm yourself with knowledge, friends.
00:30:25 Indeed, indeed.
00:30:27 Okay, that's it.
00:30:28 While I was in England, I just kind of reflexively
00:30:31 checked the calories of whatever I'm eating,
00:30:33 and just, I don't even, just even fun, honestly,
00:30:35 just to see what's going on.
00:30:37 And the European like dietary thing on the back,
00:30:41 the nutritional facts, are like a maze.
00:30:44 Like I can't ascertain what's happening.
00:30:46 Like in America, it just is like
00:30:48 in giant, bold calories, whatever.
00:30:52 Even on like a zero calorie drink, which I had,
00:30:55 I just couldn't even find where it actually said
00:30:57 zero calories, besides the actual label.
00:31:01 Because we have such an epidemic over here,
00:31:03 of fatties, they gotta make it really clear.
00:31:05 That's true.
00:31:06 As a further selling point for my fitness pal,
00:31:09 I can't speak to losers or the other ones,
00:31:10 but like just so everyone know, it's so easy.
00:31:12 Here's what you do.
00:31:13 You measure, you get a scale.
00:31:14 A scale is important.
00:31:15 You say what you are right now.
00:31:17 Whatever your goal is, gain weight, lose weight, that's fine.
00:31:20 On the thing, you can set your goal.
00:31:21 If your goal is to lose weight,
00:31:23 you put in your target weight,
00:31:25 and then you set how fast you wanna lose it.
00:31:27 It just tells you how many calories
00:31:30 you need to eat per day, and you just have to fit that.
00:31:32 So it's, it gives you all the tools.
00:31:34 And what's sick is if you're under your calorie weight,
00:31:36 or your calorie count, and you end the day like that,
00:31:38 it'll give you a projection.
00:31:40 Like if you eat like this for another six weeks,
00:31:42 you will be at your target weight.
00:31:43 And it's just like, oh.
00:31:44 Exactly.
00:31:45 I can be the person I wanna be in six weeks,
00:31:47 in time for BronyCon.
00:31:49 Oh my God.
00:31:50 Exactly.
00:31:51 I feel like, I don't think it can really
00:31:54 calculate that accurately though.
00:31:56 Nothing, sure.
00:31:57 I kind of feel like if you're using that,
00:32:00 and you're like, oh, I'll weigh this much
00:32:02 at such and such time.
00:32:03 It's just for motivation.
00:32:05 You're setting yourself up for deployment,
00:32:06 because it's not actually gonna match up.
00:32:11 Well, you should never expect an exact result.
00:32:13 But like, if you follow the trend,
00:32:15 and you should track your progress
00:32:17 you should weigh yourself literally every day
00:32:19 at the same time per day,
00:32:20 I do it right when I wake up.
00:32:22 So that, like what matters is not the numbers,
00:32:24 because the numbers can fluctuate,
00:32:25 it's never perfectly accurate.
00:32:26 What matters is the trend line.
00:32:28 If the trend line's going the way you want it to go,
00:32:30 you know you're doing something right.
00:32:32 If it's not, then some good.
00:32:33 Imagine if there was an app to weigh yourself.
00:32:35 If you don't have a scale,
00:32:36 you just stand on your phone and it tells you.
00:32:38 That'd be nice.
00:32:39 Okay, okay.
00:32:39 Buy a scale, invest.
00:32:41 My roommate, my roommate has a,
00:32:43 he got a new scale, like a fancy scale, right?
00:32:46 And I've been weighing myself on it.
00:32:47 I find out after like several weeks
00:32:50 that this scale is connected to an app on his phone.
00:32:53 And every time I weigh myself,
00:32:55 he gets a report about how much I weigh.
00:32:58 Oh!
00:32:59 So he's, so like what time he's like,
00:33:01 hey Ben, I saw you lost a couple more pounds.
00:33:04 Congratulations.
00:33:05 I'm like, what the fuck, what the fuck do you know?
00:33:09 Dude, that's fucked up.
00:33:10 I know.
00:33:11 Just noticing you're a little more cut, Ben.
00:33:13 The guts getting smaller, I'm proud of you.
00:33:16 I didn't realize it was attached to his,
00:33:18 it was fucking connected by wifi or whatever it is.
00:33:20 I would love that function, but that is fucked up.
00:33:23 Now here's the million dollar question.
00:33:25 Did you ask permission to use a scale
00:33:26 or did you just start it?
00:33:27 Yeah, yes.
00:33:28 Hoping.
00:33:29 No, he told, no, he said, no, he said,
00:33:30 like, yeah, I got a new scale and I'm like,
00:33:32 and I'm like, cool, right?
00:33:33 It was, but you know, I can't,
00:33:36 I can't tell it like, hey, scale.
00:33:39 Don't count this one.
00:33:39 It's me, Ben.
00:33:40 Please no bully.
00:33:41 It's me, yeah, it's me, Ben.
00:33:44 It's not that other guy, it's this other guy.
00:33:46 You know that famous clip of the fat lady
00:33:49 hitting the scale?
00:33:50 It's only, it's Ben, he's like,
00:33:52 you will not report me to the authorities.
00:33:54 You will not tattle on me about my progress.
00:33:57 Wait, which clip?
00:33:59 There's a clip of like a fat lady,
00:34:01 not to, I'm not trying to be mean, but she is fat,
00:34:03 where she's like, she's saying like,
00:34:05 this scale has affected the self-esteem of women
00:34:08 like for generations and we're fighting back.
00:34:10 So she takes a hammer and she smashes the scale.
00:34:13 This is for, you know, hurting my feelings and whatnot.
00:34:16 Oh, is that a scale?
00:34:18 Yeah, it's a scale, it's a scale.
00:34:19 I thought she was using like,
00:34:20 I thought she was like smashing an American flag.
00:34:23 Um, I think that's-
00:34:24 They look exactly the same,
00:34:26 because I understand the confusion.
00:34:26 I've only seen that clip with like other things edited
00:34:29 over the thing.
00:34:30 Yeah, it does get me.
00:34:31 I just assumed it was an American,
00:34:33 God, okay, smashing the scale, all right.
00:34:35 Ben would see the American flag one
00:34:37 and use that as the reference point.
00:34:39 I just seemed like it was a political thing,
00:34:41 like the way she's talking.
00:34:43 Only the way it's been edited, not originally.
00:34:46 That would feel be like a very inefficient way
00:34:48 to destroy a flag with a hammer.
00:34:51 True.
00:34:52 You know, well that's true.
00:34:52 You know, someone brought the hammer,
00:34:54 the other one brought the sickle,
00:34:55 it was a, you know, they were trying to send a message.
00:34:58 Yeah, that's true, that's true.
00:35:01 Good times, good times.
00:35:03 Speaking of keeping apps with keeping going for days on end.
00:35:09 Yeah.
00:35:10 I have been continuing my Duolingo journey
00:35:12 into languages.
00:35:14 They added Arabic, didn't they, on Arabic?
00:35:16 They have added Arabic since the last time I mentioned this,
00:35:20 and I have been going,
00:35:21 overall, I've been going for 42 days straight,
00:35:23 so that's pretty cool.
00:35:24 Hell yeah, nice.
00:35:27 Here's a review of Arabic, the language,
00:35:29 and also the lessons on Duolingo.
00:35:33 Arabic, very squiggly, very funny.
00:35:37 Very strange in that like a letter will,
00:35:42 depending on where it is in the word,
00:35:44 will have a completely different shape,
00:35:45 but like parts of the shape will be recognizable.
00:35:49 So like the oo sound looks like a G.
00:35:52 And when you have a consonant followed by an oo sound,
00:35:56 a tiny version of that oo like G
00:35:59 will be like above the consonant.
00:36:01 But if it's at the end, it will just be by itself.
00:36:04 And then a consonants can like change shape,
00:36:06 depending on whether they're at the beginning
00:36:08 or the end of the sentence.
00:36:09 And it's very confusing until you just,
00:36:13 you know, you know what they are.
00:36:15 It's gonna internalize that weird shit.
00:36:17 And there was a moment,
00:36:19 I just remember when I was learning Japanese,
00:36:20 at the first, it looks like all squiggles.
00:36:23 There's just one point where it's like,
00:36:25 oh, I actually understand there's like actual meaning
00:36:27 attached to these squiggles.
00:36:29 And that's a really great moment to get to.
00:36:31 It's really satisfying.
00:36:32 You jump into like a new lesson
00:36:34 and there's a bunch of new squiggles
00:36:35 that they're introducing you to
00:36:36 and you don't know what they mean.
00:36:38 And you get them wrong a few times,
00:36:39 but then you realize like,
00:36:41 oh, one dot above this thing means an S sound,
00:36:44 but three dots above it means a sure sound.
00:36:47 So like you piece together the puzzle
00:36:50 and then when you see three dots,
00:36:51 you immediately know what it is.
00:36:53 And it's like, wow, I'm figuring it out.
00:36:55 I'm learning Arabic.
00:36:57 And I don't know any words
00:37:00 because Duolingo, the app, the Arabic course,
00:37:04 seems to be mostly introducing you
00:37:07 to the way these squiggles sound when you say them
00:37:10 and not into like explaining
00:37:12 what these squiggles can be turned into words.
00:37:14 I was just gonna ask
00:37:16 if you could say something for us in Arabic.
00:37:18 I suppose you gotta start with that though, right?
00:37:21 Yeah, well, the other ones that I've been trying
00:37:23 like Hebrew and Chinese and stuff,
00:37:25 they quite quickly go into things like,
00:37:28 oh, a hospital is these characters
00:37:30 or a doctor or words that you can use in things
00:37:35 like, hello, goodbye, thank you.
00:37:38 Arabic, I've really only learned that America
00:37:41 and English and Scotland,
00:37:47 it's like, they just say the same thing in English,
00:37:51 but it's slightly different
00:37:52 because they didn't invent the words,
00:37:53 so it sounds the same.
00:37:54 And they've been giving me like names like Zaid
00:37:59 and Rosa and Otto,
00:38:01 and I've been figuring out like by looking at the squiggles
00:38:05 what sounds they would make
00:38:07 and figuring out the names.
00:38:09 But I mean, it's satisfying in that,
00:38:12 but I'm really wondering when I'm gonna get to a point
00:38:14 because I've done quite a lot of these lessons.
00:38:16 I haven't really got to a point
00:38:17 when I'm learning words yet,
00:38:19 but if I see an Arabic sign, I would be able to say it,
00:38:21 I just wouldn't know what I was saying.
00:38:24 That's interesting.
00:38:25 You know, I would think like as a professional
00:38:27 Japanese educator,
00:38:28 which I have made one video on on my channel,
00:38:31 you'd think that what you do is you like teach
00:38:33 a couple characters and then you immediately try
00:38:36 to make as many words as possible
00:38:37 with the limited characters you've taught
00:38:39 to help them like latch on to real meanings
00:38:42 for those things.
00:38:43 Like when Japanese, you'll start with the vowels,
00:38:45 and then you like the first ones are ah and e,
00:38:48 a and i in English.
00:38:49 And ie literally is a word that means love in Japanese.
00:38:54 So like boom, your first two letters,
00:38:55 you have a word instantly,
00:38:57 like now meanings are beginning to be associated.
00:38:59 Isn't that cool?
00:39:00 I wonder why the Arabic's different.
00:39:02 Maybe just because it's new.
00:39:03 I think it might be new.
00:39:05 Also, it might be that there's just a lot of squiggles.
00:39:08 By the way, I said the three dots was a sh,
00:39:11 and a single dot was s.
00:39:13 May not actually be true.
00:39:15 I think I may be mixing that up with t and th,
00:39:18 just make it sure if anybody is also learning Arabic
00:39:22 or knows Arabic.
00:39:23 Don't kill me.
00:39:24 Hello.
00:39:26 Hello.
00:39:27 But yeah, I really, there's this really funny one,
00:39:30 which is.
00:39:31 I look forward to the give PCPU lecture on Arabic,
00:39:32 and perhaps Arabic history.
00:39:34 I mean, you know what, I'll do it.
00:39:36 PCP, PCP, PCP lecture on the Israeli,
00:39:39 Palestinian conflict, please.
00:39:41 Oh yeah.
00:39:42 Yeah, I'll learn Hebrew, I'll learn Arabic,
00:39:43 and then I'll fucking understand,
00:39:45 I'll be super enlightened,
00:39:46 and I'll be like, guys, I got it.
00:39:48 Oh my God, you can finally end the conflict.
00:39:50 I'll make a PCP lecture on how to,
00:39:53 by the way, there's this w,
00:39:55 it looks like a three turn sideways.
00:39:58 If you put that w, a tiny little w,
00:40:01 over the top of a consonant,
00:40:02 that just makes the consonant longer.
00:40:04 So say if you have shu as a word,
00:40:07 if you put that there on the s, it'll be shu,
00:40:10 and they distinct, they have like words
00:40:14 that are distinctly different based on how long
00:40:17 certain consonants and vowels are held,
00:40:19 and it's cool.
00:40:20 And also I'm learning the ch sounds,
00:40:22 the ih ch, all those,
00:40:24 there's multiple different types of those.
00:40:26 Oh my God.
00:40:27 So, pretty complex,
00:40:29 I don't know whether I'll ever be proficient in it,
00:40:32 but I'm just gonna keep going,
00:40:33 because it is very fun to figure it out.
00:40:36 It's got the bleeps, the sweeps, and the creeps.
00:40:39 My favorite things.
00:40:41 I've always thought it's very romantic
00:40:44 to learn a new language,
00:40:46 but they're known if there was a language
00:40:47 that would actually like benefit me,
00:40:49 obviously they're Spanish,
00:40:50 and it's universal, if you live in America,
00:40:52 you should also learn Spanish,
00:40:53 because that will just open a lot of opportunities for you.
00:40:56 But like, I don't know, I don't have to speak Spanish.
00:41:00 But also like hashtag build the wall,
00:41:02 if you know what I'm saying.
00:41:03 Yeah, well I think I mentioned this last time,
00:41:07 but like, I don't know how important this app would be
00:41:11 if you need to learn, if you like need to learn a language.
00:41:15 Like for work or something?
00:41:17 Yeah, I mean if you can,
00:41:19 because some of these they work better with learning
00:41:22 how to read and write the things
00:41:24 rather than how to speak it,
00:41:25 because they have voice clips for every thing,
00:41:29 and sometimes it gives you a voice,
00:41:30 and you have to try and put letters
00:41:32 or like, figure it out through that.
00:41:36 But sometimes they don't,
00:41:37 and a lot of the time, at least in Hebrew,
00:41:42 I couldn't really make out what the hell they were saying,
00:41:44 but I could figure out the letters.
00:41:46 So I'd be able to read,
00:41:47 but if I were actually to go to Israel,
00:41:49 or to go to some of these countries for these languages,
00:41:52 I wouldn't really know how to talk to the people,
00:41:54 unless I was in that country,
00:41:56 and I just sort of learned it through osmosis.
00:41:59 Well you know, that's actually pretty cool,
00:42:00 because I know a couple of people,
00:42:02 like for example, Michelle's dad
00:42:04 like had to learn Korean when he was in the military,
00:42:07 and like, so he's actually, he's Japanese,
00:42:09 but he was forced to learn Korean,
00:42:11 he like doesn't speak Japanese very much,
00:42:13 which is pretty funny.
00:42:14 But like, it's just because he had to work
00:42:16 with like Korean people, he just like just on the job,
00:42:19 he was an American, didn't speak the language,
00:42:20 just like had to learn it for his job.
00:42:23 And I've always like,
00:42:24 I mean, I do things related to Japanese,
00:42:26 I hope to kind of through osmosis,
00:42:29 just like pick up more,
00:42:30 but I'm aware I'll have to like force myself,
00:42:31 or spend a lot of time around like,
00:42:33 exclusively speaking Japanese people probably,
00:42:36 to learn any of it.
00:42:38 I want to not have to do any work,
00:42:41 I want the environment around me to just teach me things.
00:42:43 And that's what I want, that would be great,
00:42:45 that would be excellent if that could happen.
00:42:47 But I don't know, I've always thought it was pretty cool
00:42:49 how people will like learn new languages
00:42:51 just for their jobs.
00:42:53 I always thought that was neat.
00:42:54 Like if you're like, hey, oh, Johnson,
00:42:57 we're transferring you to the Mumbai account,
00:43:00 I'm trying to think of some like Indian city.
00:43:02 Go learn, they got like a million languages in India,
00:43:04 but go learn whatever they speak over there.
00:43:07 Hindi, yeah, Hindi, go learn that, Johnson.
00:43:10 Yes, sir, off I go.
00:43:12 And then he does somehow.
00:43:14 I was, by the way, here's my invite link to Duolingo.
00:43:17 If you use this link to get on,
00:43:19 I get a free week of Duolingo Plus,
00:43:24 which has no benefits really at all,
00:43:25 except that it has no ads.
00:43:27 No, that's a plus, that's a plus.
00:43:29 I was, I was thinking about this earlier,
00:43:32 because I was getting pizza with Sixton,
00:43:35 who is over here staying at my house, famous,
00:43:38 Ronnie Cooker's Con Killers.
00:43:40 Oh yeah, famous, right?
00:43:41 For his Con Killers, Pop Idol,
00:43:43 and musician behind the Izumi game.
00:43:45 So, oh yeah, cool, God tier, God tier musician.
00:43:48 Anyway, he's here at my house,
00:43:50 and we were hanging out, we were getting pizza.
00:43:52 And I thought about how, isn't funny,
00:43:55 how you can go to like Italian restaurant or something,
00:43:57 or like an Indian restaurant, or a Mexican restaurant,
00:43:59 and it will be made up of staff who is that ethnicity.
00:44:03 And it makes sense, obviously, you know,
00:44:05 they may know how to make the meals better
00:44:07 than anyone else would.
00:44:08 But imagining from like the initial perspective
00:44:10 of like, imagine if I were to like immigrate to France,
00:44:14 and then I'm like, well, I'm American,
00:44:16 might as well like push this angle a lot,
00:44:18 and then I went to like a McDonald's,
00:44:20 or I went to like a burger place to start like that.
00:44:22 Oh, this is my life now, you know?
00:44:24 I was born American, so this is what I'm gonna do
00:44:26 with my life.
00:44:27 That's not exactly what's going on here though.
00:44:28 I'm just gonna push my angle.
00:44:29 Well, what do you mean?
00:44:31 I mean, they're doing what they know.
00:44:32 They probably like were a cook, I assume, you know,
00:44:35 either with their family,
00:44:36 or if they like came from another country,
00:44:38 that's like, you know, that's their specialty.
00:44:40 So they're offering, that's what they have to offer
00:44:42 in a business sense.
00:44:43 They're like a specialist in this kind of cooking
00:44:45 or something.
00:44:46 Sure, but I'm trying to think about the amount of times
00:44:48 that I see another like, for instance, in Italian.
00:44:52 When do I see an Italian outside an Italian restaurant?
00:44:56 Like, never.
00:44:56 I mean, it's probably family run though, right?
00:44:59 Like a Chinese restaurant, right?
00:45:00 Like what we think of as American Chinese food
00:45:03 is not like, you know, to Chinese food staples,
00:45:08 crab rangoon, not Chinese, invented in California.
00:45:12 I think, oh God, was it, is it,
00:45:14 I think General So's chicken is what you're saying.
00:45:17 These are like, these are staples of Chinese food restaurants
00:45:20 and they're not thing,
00:45:21 I mean, they'd probably have them in China,
00:45:23 but it's not like traditional Chinese food.
00:45:25 But when you go to like your American Chinese one,
00:45:28 when you go to your American Chinese restaurant though,
00:45:31 you see like, it's generally speaking,
00:45:33 Chinese people run in the place.
00:45:35 I know, but I'm saying that like they still have to learn.
00:45:39 You know, it's not like they just like show up in America
00:45:42 and they're like, well, I'm just gonna,
00:45:43 I'm gonna take all the things that mama taught me
00:45:46 how to make and that's gonna be my restaurant.
00:45:49 And then, and then they just,
00:45:52 that's what ends up on the menu.
00:45:54 I think there is gotta be a little bit of like,
00:45:57 I'm Chinese, time to start a Chinese restaurant.
00:46:00 Because if I didn't, the customer would experience,
00:46:03 there would be ludonarrative dissonance
00:46:04 when you eat in my restaurant
00:46:06 and everyone would, and everyone would be freaked out
00:46:08 and be like, this doesn't, ah, this doesn't taste authentic.
00:46:11 Pig slob, bad review on y'all.
00:46:14 What's the pose though?
00:46:15 Exactly that.
00:46:16 Sixth one's relaying me about how his friend,
00:46:18 who was white, wanted to work at like a,
00:46:20 I believe it was a Thai place.
00:46:22 And they're like, if you aren't Thai, you can't work here.
00:46:24 Like they said, don't call back.
00:46:25 You at least gotta look Thai.
00:46:26 Yeah.
00:46:27 You can be, you can be like,
00:46:29 you can be like, you can be some other Asian,
00:46:31 just keep your mouth shut.
00:46:32 Yeah.
00:46:33 I would really like to see a Chinese-run Italian restaurant
00:46:37 because they would make the spaghetti all different.
00:46:39 I mean, you know, walk, spaghetti and walk.
00:46:42 You know, is that, is that, I mean, I personally,
00:46:44 I have no problem with a restaurant doing that
00:46:46 if they want to.
00:46:47 Like they can hire whoever they want.
00:46:48 That's their business.
00:46:49 But like, is that actually like a crime
00:46:51 to like discriminate in that way
00:46:52 based on like the race of the people applying?
00:46:56 Well, out of Sweden, maybe.
00:46:59 Well, I think, I think generally the reasons for hiring,
00:47:04 you can't like, you're not like forced by the government
00:47:08 to hire people just because.
00:47:12 But you are, you are barred by the government
00:47:14 from not hiring people because of some specific criteria.
00:47:18 I would imagine, I don't know.
00:47:19 I would imagine that when you go to like a Chinese restaurant
00:47:22 and everyone there working there is Chinese,
00:47:24 it is like primarily because the place is owned by a family
00:47:28 and like a lot of the people working there
00:47:30 are in the family or friends of the family or whatever.
00:47:34 Probably.
00:47:35 Also like, like Ben in Chinatown,
00:47:37 I was wondering, not very seriously,
00:47:39 like, you know, what if I got a job,
00:47:40 like it's somewhere around here just over the summer,
00:47:42 well, well, I'm going to college.
00:47:44 But like, you know, I couldn't because I don't speak Mandarin
00:47:46 and I'm not Chinese, which Mandarin is more of like
00:47:49 a skill set, which makes sense.
00:47:50 Well, that's the real issue.
00:47:51 If like the whole restaurant is run by people
00:47:53 who like really speak Chinese
00:47:55 and maybe their English isn't necessarily great,
00:47:57 then like they're probably going to want to hire people
00:47:59 who, you know, share that language.
00:48:00 Yeah, that's a legit reason.
00:48:02 Maybe this is a stupid question,
00:48:04 but is racism illegal or is it just like very largely
00:48:08 maligned as a thing to speak?
00:48:10 Racism is basically illegal as far as like,
00:48:11 it feels like it's pretty new.
00:48:13 Well, I mean, you are, you are not allowed to like
00:48:18 bar someone from employee on the basis of race.
00:48:21 Yeah.
00:48:22 So it's like, you know, you're not allowed to do that
00:48:24 specifically and things like that.
00:48:26 Like certain, certain, certain like racist reasons,
00:48:30 things are illegal like that, but like,
00:48:33 you're not like arrested just for being a racist.
00:48:35 It's illegal, but like, or well, yeah.
00:48:37 No, no, no, it's not illegal on paper at all.
00:48:39 You can feel whatever you want, which is what's illegal.
00:48:42 He means hiring, so like, like making a hiring decision.
00:48:44 Yeah, that's what I mean.
00:48:46 That's all right.
00:48:47 I didn't know that.
00:48:47 I just thought of that idea.
00:48:50 There are, there are laws like that in America.
00:48:53 I suspect that with this like,
00:48:54 China, if for whatever reason,
00:48:56 somebody wanted to be like, they're like, I don't know,
00:48:58 wait, and they want to work at a Chinese restaurant.
00:49:00 I suspect if you like, filed a lawsuit and kept going,
00:49:04 you'd probably win.
00:49:06 And then they'd have to give some other reason.
00:49:08 Wait, couldn't they just, I don't know.
00:49:10 Couldn't they just like, lie about it?
00:49:12 Say, are you not the right guy for the job?
00:49:13 Well, I think that's why they would like,
00:49:15 that's why you would sue and do an investigation.
00:49:17 Here's what I think.
00:49:17 I think the reason is probably, it's not like,
00:49:20 I bet that they'd never have any positions open
00:49:24 because if they did, they would immediately just fill them
00:49:27 like, through like, friend of the family,
00:49:30 like, who do I know?
00:49:31 Right?
00:49:32 Probably, probably.
00:49:33 There's been hiring signs in Shintown before.
00:49:36 Yeah.
00:49:36 If they were putting out, if they put out a sign
00:49:38 that says like, hiring and you showed up and you applied
00:49:41 and like, you spoke the language that the boss speaks.
00:49:44 Yeah.
00:49:45 You probably, they probably can sue you.
00:49:46 Because at that point, like, they're out of people.
00:49:49 They're out of like, in-group people that they know.
00:49:51 Like, they're looking for outsiders.
00:49:53 I imagine this is probably, jobs happen.
00:49:54 I'm sure you could get a job like that.
00:49:57 Yeah.
00:49:58 But I just think it generally doesn't come to that
00:50:00 because probably these kinds of establishments
00:50:03 tend to hire in, like, inside the family
00:50:05 or their community.
00:50:05 I don't know, man.
00:50:06 I've seen now hiring signs before in Shintown.
00:50:09 I know I've seen like, for example,
00:50:10 you see a lot of like, you know,
00:50:12 whatever, Latin America or whatever people.
00:50:13 I've seen them working in like,
00:50:14 Chinese food kitchens in the past.
00:50:16 I assume because, you know, it's the kind of work
00:50:18 that maybe people who are fresh to the country
00:50:21 can get relatively easily and learn the,
00:50:24 maybe they're a chef of some kind
00:50:25 and, you know, looking for a job in the meantime.
00:50:27 Eh, I don't know.
00:50:29 I have a feeling, I have a feeling
00:50:31 that probably relatively few people working at restaurants
00:50:34 like that are like, professional chefs from the old country.
00:50:39 Well, yeah.
00:50:39 And it's probably just more like, I showed up here.
00:50:41 Chef was the wrong word, probably.
00:50:42 I don't know anyone.
00:50:44 I've never cooked a day in my life,
00:50:45 but like my uncle's, like my uncle's like wife's son
00:50:51 just opened a fucking restaurant or whatever.
00:50:53 And I guess I got an in there.
00:50:54 So I'll go do that, you know.
00:50:57 When Tony Montana came into America
00:51:00 at the beginning of Scarface,
00:51:01 he was able to get a job at like some shitty restaurant
00:51:04 that's open like 24 hours or whatever, washing dishes
00:51:07 and making like shitty sandwiches
00:51:09 for like dock workers in Miami or whatever.
00:51:11 And I imagine that's relatively the experience.
00:51:14 You get like a low, low level job.
00:51:17 But then you just become, or rather you continue
00:51:20 your active campaign as an assassin from the third world
00:51:23 and you just move up the ranks like hotcakes.
00:51:26 You move to pushing cocaine,
00:51:27 you move to doing bigger and bigger dope deals,
00:51:29 you commit assassinations for your political friends
00:51:33 and bing bong bing, you got yourself a mansion.
00:51:34 I'm just saying, nepotism is a fact of life
00:51:38 and they're definitely, this is definitely
00:51:41 just because they're hiring the people they already know.
00:51:43 They're hiring friends of friends, right?
00:51:45 That's it, solved.
00:51:46 I solved the issue, no more.
00:51:47 It's the end.
00:51:48 The reason why is obvious, but it's interesting
00:51:51 that we just kind of assume that, you know,
00:51:54 if you are from ethnicity,
00:51:55 you may know how to cook the ethnicity as food.
00:51:58 And like- It's more likely, right?
00:51:59 And we are like, you know, like it would be sort of like,
00:52:02 you know, it may not be like bad or weird,
00:52:05 but if you were like at a Chinese restaurant
00:52:07 and some like white dude were to serve you,
00:52:09 you'd be like, oh, huh, interesting.
00:52:11 I'd puke instantly.
00:52:12 I'd fucking shoot out my goo from all orifices.
00:52:16 But it's funny that we say that because yeah, you're right.
00:52:18 I guess it is more likely,
00:52:21 but I think very small of an increase
00:52:23 because I wouldn't assume that anyone just walking
00:52:27 down the street would be able to cook
00:52:29 like at like a traditional American meal.
00:52:32 I wouldn't assume that everyone's a cook
00:52:34 that would know how to do it effectively.
00:52:35 What even is a traditional American meal,
00:52:37 burger and fries?
00:52:39 It's like a pie or something, like an apple pie?
00:52:42 Is that even American?
00:52:43 They say apple pie is American and shit,
00:52:46 but is that even a fact?
00:52:47 You understand what I mean.
00:52:49 I do, I do.
00:52:51 So it's interesting that we're just like, oh yeah.
00:52:54 Listen, you know, Irish, oh, you can make a fucking pastrami.
00:52:58 You can whip me up a Guinness, can't you?
00:53:00 Yeah, yeah, you can whip me up a fucking corned beef.
00:53:03 Just get in there, buddy, just go behind the grill.
00:53:06 I pelt wheat.
00:53:07 Oh, wait, wait, what do they make Guinness out of?
00:53:09 Wheat, I assume, because it's beer, is that?
00:53:10 They make it out of beer.
00:53:12 Oh, pups, pups, pups, Jesus Christ.
00:53:19 Oh, oh, you know what, Munchy,
00:53:21 talk about the time you drank three beers.
00:53:23 Yes, yes, yes, I'm saying the Guinness is a perfect segue
00:53:28 because last we spoke, that was my knockoff record rel
00:53:33 from that one guide code commercial impression.
00:53:36 Last we spoke, I had drank in one apple cider,
00:53:41 and that was like insane, like I couldn't even believe
00:53:44 what had just happened, and I broke all the sacred vows.
00:53:46 Do you mean like, do you mean a hard apple cider,
00:53:48 like in My Little Pony?
00:53:50 Yes, literally exactly.
00:53:51 Applejack came up to me in Victoria Square,
00:53:53 she said, hey, y'all, and I slapped her
00:53:55 and I drank her fucking cider.
00:53:57 And in your traditional British accent,
00:53:59 she said, howdy, y'all.
00:54:00 Yeah, exactly, and that was it.
00:54:03 I had cursed my family and I was dishonored forever,
00:54:07 but it felt pretty good.
00:54:08 And then later, due to yaya yada circumstances,
00:54:13 me, Hepo, his father, and a bunch of his fucking rowdy,
00:54:15 like English coworkers, went out to a pub, a proper pub,
00:54:21 with dim lighting, with brown on the walls,
00:54:25 and a bunch of weird knickknacks everywhere,
00:54:27 an actual literal cartoon I stepped inside of.
00:54:30 Like from the movies?
00:54:31 Yeah, like from the movies, wow.
00:54:33 Literally, I mean, I don't think of it as much
00:54:36 because I've seen these sorts of pubs
00:54:38 semi-regularly all my life,
00:54:40 but I guess it is sort of like the cartoony,
00:54:43 prototypical stereotype of a English pub
00:54:46 with the dark oak seats and the dark and the green
00:54:50 sort of cushions and dim lighting
00:54:53 and the curtains and everything.
00:54:54 I literally long jumped into the TV that day
00:54:57 and I appeared inside a pub.
00:55:00 And I was kind of just ready to get like a water.
00:55:03 Yeah, holy.
00:55:04 Literally, I would,
00:55:04 ha, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu,
00:55:06 wee!
00:55:08 And I was kind of just ready to get like a water,
00:55:11 like I was kind of just prepared
00:55:12 to not really do anything
00:55:14 because that was my last day in England.
00:55:17 And the plan was to drink until the pain's over,
00:55:20 but worse, worse, the pain or the hangover.
00:55:22 Hangover, yeah.
00:55:23 And I was just gonna stay up
00:55:24 and I was gonna sleep on the plane,
00:55:26 which I will get into the aftermath of that later
00:55:28 because that's a whole story into itself,
00:55:29 but I was gonna stay up on it.
00:55:30 So I didn't wanna just, you know, get fucked up and die.
00:55:33 But the sweet old man who ran Hippo's dad's,
00:55:39 like I don't know, the scout thing going on,
00:55:41 whatever, it doesn't matter.
00:55:42 Well, he didn't run.
00:55:43 He hasn't run it for a while,
00:55:44 but he used to be in charge.
00:55:46 Well, the point is that there was a sweet old man there
00:55:48 who offered me a drink and who was I to decline.
00:55:52 And so he got me an actual beer.
00:55:55 So the age of drinking is 18?
00:55:58 Yes, yes, yes, that's why, yeah.
00:56:01 And he got me a lager, a lager, is it called?
00:56:06 Oh, yeah.
00:56:08 Ooh, I've heard of those.
00:56:10 To be honest with you, I hadn't.
00:56:11 So he got me that.
00:56:13 And then halfway through drinking that slowly,
00:56:15 because it tasted just like fermented dirt
00:56:17 is what it tastes like.
00:56:19 I was halfway through and I thought, this sucks.
00:56:21 I'll just go to the end and then I'll stop.
00:56:23 And then Hippo's dad,
00:56:24 the hero slash villain question mark that he is,
00:56:28 just gave me another one,
00:56:30 just placed down in my sights,
00:56:33 in my sniper reticule, a second version of my drink.
00:56:37 So I was like, oh, so what am I gonna say?
00:56:40 Am I gonna splash in his fucking face and say no?
00:56:43 No, I'm just gonna have to deal with this.
00:56:45 This is just my life now.
00:56:46 I'm halfway through drinking that one, two beers,
00:56:48 and then again, another drink up here before me.
00:56:51 Oh my God, he's brits.
00:56:53 And they're just fucking loading it up
00:56:55 to do whatever saw to me
00:56:56 they could possibly want to do to me.
00:56:57 He's fucking limies, yeah.
00:56:59 They're setting you up for a fall, friend.
00:57:00 Yeah, and you know what?
00:57:02 It's weird, because I finally, beer snapped in my mind,
00:57:05 as did many brain cells.
00:57:07 And I finally understood why,
00:57:09 because why people drink beer
00:57:11 is because after the first drink,
00:57:13 beer tastes like nothing because your body is destroyed.
00:57:16 And so it doesn't taste bad anymore after the first drink.
00:57:19 It just tastes like...
00:57:21 All it tastes like is you go to pick up your drink,
00:57:24 then you've put down your drink
00:57:25 because you've over-drinked it,
00:57:26 and then your mind's confused
00:57:27 because you just lagged out for a second.
00:57:29 Yeah, that's right.
00:57:31 And anyway, it was a great time
00:57:33 because of the previously mentioned rowdy coworkers
00:57:36 who were speaking in their foreign tongues,
00:57:39 calling me Donald,
00:57:40 and talking to me about MPs.
00:57:44 No, no, no, that's my father.
00:57:45 I'm Munchie J from...
00:57:46 Yeah, no, no, no, literally.
00:57:47 Okay, one...
00:57:49 Yeah, yeah, the moment with the phone.
00:57:51 Yeah, do you want to say it?
00:57:52 My dad, well, you can tell the story,
00:57:55 but I just want to tell you
00:57:56 that my dad was really impressed by that
00:57:59 and has mentioned the story like three times already.
00:58:02 That American guy, that Munchie guy,
00:58:05 is really great, really witty.
00:58:07 He'll do great things.
00:58:09 It's like, yeah.
00:58:10 What? Oh my God!
00:58:13 Yeah, he really likes you.
00:58:15 Both of my parents really like you.
00:58:16 Andrew, an old man, mentioned you again.
00:58:20 You really hit it off with everyone.
00:58:21 Oh my God!
00:58:22 That's great!
00:58:23 Oh, my heart's a flutter, be still!
00:58:26 I can't believe this.
00:58:27 Oh, I'm doing that thing that girls do
00:58:29 when they put like one leg up behind them
00:58:31 while they're kissing someone.
00:58:32 Obulate, obulate.
00:58:32 Yeah, yeah, obulate.
00:58:34 Yeah, yeah, obulate.
00:58:37 Anyway, one of the coworkers,
00:58:40 like they're fucking like,
00:58:41 it was like a family-run business,
00:58:42 like the Chinese do as a business,
00:58:45 as pulled back the current on
00:58:46 and called it for what it is.
00:58:48 I just said what we were all thinking,
00:58:50 that Ben St. Guy.
00:58:51 He's gonna get like a point.
00:58:52 He's gonna get like a point.
00:58:53 Yeah, yeah.
00:58:54 And one of their brothers called,
00:58:57 and they were like passing around the phone
00:58:58 to everyone to play a prank on him.
00:59:00 When they got to me,
00:59:01 I was already like, I'm a lightweight,
00:59:04 so like the three were, it was able to get to me,
00:59:06 and I was able to do it.
00:59:07 Which is surprising considering your size,
00:59:08 but you're a young undrink or so,
00:59:10 that'll do it, yeah, yeah.
00:59:12 And I remember, I just answered the phone,
00:59:15 it was passed to me, it was some dude,
00:59:17 I'd never met before.
00:59:18 And I said, Nigel, I gotta say,
00:59:20 I love what you've done for the family,
00:59:22 and I can't wait to meet you in person.
00:59:25 I love what you've done.
00:59:26 Oh my God, my chair just broke,
00:59:27 my chair just broke, my chair just broke,
00:59:29 my chair just broke.
00:59:30 It's completely broken.
00:59:32 I wasn't sure if this was part of the story
00:59:34 or something that actually just happened.
00:59:37 Did you hear the snap?
00:59:38 Did you hear the snap?
00:59:39 I did hear the snap.
00:59:40 The fucking Thanos snap of your chair.
00:59:43 Okay, all right, hold on.
00:59:44 I'm just gonna keep speaking
00:59:45 while I take a picture of my now,
00:59:47 completely and utterly broken chair.
00:59:50 Okay, I can't hear you for one second.
00:59:53 There's the photo.
00:59:56 Anyway, the point is, is that he called me Donald.
00:59:58 Show notes, please.
01:00:01 I said that Donald's my father, please call me Baron.
01:00:05 And then we just, we just talked about Boris Johnson,
01:00:08 we talked about who's gonna be the new prime minister.
01:00:11 And it was great, and it was literally an iconic evening
01:00:15 that I will not forget for the rest of my life.
01:00:17 Because it was literally a cartoon, literally a cartoon.
01:00:19 I've never been to England.
01:00:20 I wanna go there and meet Gibbs' wacky family
01:00:22 and his kooky characters.
01:00:24 Oh, they're so wacky.
01:00:25 Like, I just love like, hey, like, hey hippos,
01:00:27 dad, dance for me, you stupid fucking bitch.
01:00:29 And then you can do it over and over and over again.
01:00:31 That's what your people are known for, as I understand it.
01:00:34 All right, you taught them how to long jump back to something.
01:00:37 Yes, yes, yes.
01:00:38 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:00:41 I remember after, after,
01:00:43 okay, look at my fucking chair.
01:00:45 Look at the mangled mess that this is.
01:00:46 Whoa.
01:00:47 Oh no, so the arm just snapped off?
01:00:49 Yeah, the arm snapped, we're just right off.
01:00:53 Dope.
01:00:54 Yeah, this is great.
01:00:55 This is literally fantastic.
01:00:56 Anyway, I remember after, after, like,
01:00:58 I stood up for the first time after drinking the three,
01:01:01 the three loggers. Oh boy, yeah, there you go.
01:01:03 And my brain just was like, oh God, everything's hard now.
01:01:07 And I stumbled to the bathroom.
01:01:09 The bathroom was like a weird like pig trough
01:01:11 where there was no like urinals.
01:01:12 It just was like a wall that you piss on.
01:01:14 And it was terrifying.
01:01:15 I didn't know if I was just...
01:01:16 Yeah, it was a pretty gritty bathroom.
01:01:18 I couldn't tell if I was just like pissing on the wall
01:01:21 or if I wasn't supposed to be doing what I was doing,
01:01:22 but I did anyway because I didn't fear
01:01:24 the ramifications at that point.
01:01:26 Yeah.
01:01:27 I came back and then after we were all said and done
01:01:30 about talking about our glorious God Boris Johnson,
01:01:32 we went back to Hippo's house.
01:01:34 Hippo's dad gave me a shot of whiskey
01:01:36 and I drank it and it like blew my mind off.
01:01:39 It felt like a shotgun blast
01:01:41 at the root of my fucking mouth and it was terrible.
01:01:44 And we just crushed Crash Bandicoot 3.
01:01:46 That's all we fucking did.
01:01:48 We went up to Hippo's room
01:01:49 and I was so excited to play Crash Bandicoot 3.
01:01:52 I got like one level in it, fucking sucked.
01:01:54 I gave it to Hippo and they just watched him
01:01:55 destroy Crash Bandicoot 3.
01:01:57 Like literally the hardest any gamer has ever gameed.
01:02:00 Crash Bandicoot 3 was like vanquished
01:02:02 from the face of the earth.
01:02:03 I'd be surprised if you could literally even locate
01:02:05 a copy of it after what we did last night.
01:02:08 So what are your updated thoughts on alcohol
01:02:11 after this experience?
01:02:12 My updated thoughts on alcohol
01:02:13 are actually somewhat devilish.
01:02:15 They're actually somewhat upsetting.
01:02:18 I know this is like a real heel turn.
01:02:20 I know this is like against everything
01:02:22 that like Munchie stands for as a human being
01:02:25 and that I may be kicked from like several different
01:02:28 friend groups or just like podcasts or anything.
01:02:31 And maybe like option society.
01:02:33 I didn't hate it.
01:02:34 I didn't think it was the worst thing on earth.
01:02:37 Now what about the hangover though?
01:02:39 What about the hangover afterward?
01:02:41 I didn't get a hangover.
01:02:42 You what the fuck?
01:02:43 It must be your size.
01:02:44 That's the only explanation.
01:02:45 You just somehow tanked it in your body.
01:02:47 I can't believe it.
01:02:48 We defeated Britain, broke away from America
01:02:51 all those years ago, but vengeance finally came back
01:02:54 and they took Munchie from us.
01:02:55 Those goddamn British.
01:02:56 Did you by the way, did you drink much water
01:02:59 while you were doing this?
01:02:59 Cause they always say drinking water
01:03:00 is the way to offset a hangover.
01:03:02 You did not.
01:03:02 Okay, you just carry enough ambient water with you.
01:03:06 He had, I mean, I don't know whether he drunk water
01:03:10 when we got home, but he did stay up all night
01:03:12 playing with, playing some.
01:03:14 I've heard that helps.
01:03:15 I've heard that helps too.
01:03:16 After we were gonna play Crash Bandicoot
01:03:18 and a hippo went to bed like a fucking pussy piece of shit.
01:03:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:03:22 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:03:25 What did you stay up to?
01:03:25 True, true, true, true, true, true.
01:03:27 Not even hiding from it.
01:03:28 Me and HDB guy just stayed up all night
01:03:30 talking about like real shit
01:03:32 and like diving into our psyches.
01:03:33 And then watching the English television version
01:03:36 of the Chronicles of Narnia,
01:03:38 which is really like bizarrely whimsical
01:03:40 and also ridiculous.
01:03:41 Like on his old fucking CRT.
01:03:44 Now, yeah, I really wish I'd stayed up
01:03:48 cause that does sound great.
01:03:49 I was just destroyed from various things.
01:03:53 And I woke up the next day with a sickness.
01:03:57 But anyway, that's my final kiss.
01:04:00 That's my parting gift.
01:04:02 I'm still sick from that.
01:04:04 But anyway, Munchy, before you get onto your plane ride
01:04:07 that you want to talk about, rate my family.
01:04:10 What do you think?
01:04:11 What do you think about my family?
01:04:12 What's the tier list?
01:04:14 Yeah, I will go by family member by family member.
01:04:16 What you guys have to understand
01:04:18 is that hippos, brothers, they are like a comedy troupe.
01:04:22 They are like a constructed set of characters.
01:04:25 They're like, if you go on Tumblr and like,
01:04:27 hey guys, this is my OC, Tee-hee-hee.
01:04:29 You will just see a picture of him and his brothers.
01:04:33 Like they are just like a constructed version
01:04:35 of what you think English people are like.
01:04:37 The different character archetypes
01:04:39 that there can be for British humor,
01:04:40 there they are in real life.
01:04:43 Hippos, like the Venn diagram of both of them
01:04:47 and Henry HGB guy is like total unhinged madness.
01:04:52 Like full internet neat dweller,
01:04:54 like madman insane psychopath, literal serial killer.
01:04:58 Most twisted psychopath you will ever meet.
01:05:01 And then Charlie is like this like normie,
01:05:04 like chill, like cool Chad normie,
01:05:07 who like works at construction yard
01:05:08 and just sort of like soft spoken.
01:05:11 He's like, he's the guy who like will kill people,
01:05:15 will get a lot of kills and then say something like,
01:05:17 huh, it was easy.
01:05:18 And then we load his clip.
01:05:22 So they are both Kino and I love them.
01:05:24 They're both literally 10 out of 10
01:05:26 and it was great hanging out with,
01:05:27 it was great hanging with Henry
01:05:29 because he threw up, he threw up on the train
01:05:32 and that was great.
01:05:34 And just hanging out with him was a hoot.
01:05:36 And then Charlie was like a down to earth nice guy
01:05:38 who was fun just walking around coal drop parks.
01:05:42 I believe it was coal drop park.
01:05:44 London is so fucking cool.
01:05:45 London is like better than like any American city
01:05:47 except like not at all,
01:05:48 Boston's way better half fuck you Limies,
01:05:50 but it is cool because it's so walking around pedestrian.
01:05:54 And there's just like the sight lines,
01:05:57 literally Disneyland, but a city
01:05:59 because Walt Disney himself planned out London
01:06:01 so that the sight lines,
01:06:02 we were in some like just nice little hill
01:06:05 and we were able to like watch an outdoor fucking movie
01:06:07 on a big screen on this beautiful river
01:06:10 with like a river boat that was like a turn into a library
01:06:13 and behind us there was like a chic coal plant
01:06:15 turning into like nice boutique restaurant
01:06:18 and shopping center.
01:06:19 And I couldn't even see a side scraper in sight.
01:06:21 And we were like in the heart of London,
01:06:23 literally perfect best city ever made,
01:06:27 but it fucking sucks because I got sick and fuck you.
01:06:30 Your mom's really nice.
01:06:31 You hippo look just like your mom and dad put together.
01:06:35 It's funny how those sort of things work out.
01:06:37 Literally just like copy and pasted.
01:06:40 You have your dad's face and your mom's hair.
01:06:42 Perfect.
01:06:43 Literally perfect.
01:06:46 And your mom's really nice.
01:06:47 She helped me with my coat and with my cold.
01:06:49 She nursed me back to health.
01:06:51 She was like there.
01:06:52 And then your dad got me drunk
01:06:54 and it was cool when we played Crash Bandicoot 3,
01:06:56 the best game ever made.
01:06:58 So your whole family gets a 10 out of 10,
01:07:00 munchie, a seal of approval.
01:07:03 I'm coming back right now.
01:07:04 I'm turning the boat around.
01:07:05 I'm sailing back on the Mayflower.
01:07:07 I'm gonna ram it right into the fucking Big Ben
01:07:09 and he's gonna fall down.
01:07:12 So I gotta twist my ears like in half.
01:07:15 I gotta like pick up my ears
01:07:16 and have to put them back on
01:07:17 like a fucking Mr. Potato Head.
01:07:19 I'm back now.
01:07:20 You know, just quick question slash point.
01:07:23 When I was in Japan,
01:07:24 I turned 21 while I was in Japan
01:07:26 but the drinking age there is 20.
01:07:28 So I too was able to drink just willy nilly
01:07:31 when I first got there.
01:07:33 And similarly, you know, in Britain,
01:07:36 the drinking age is 18, that's cool.
01:07:37 You know, that's the three years difference
01:07:39 versus what is in America.
01:07:40 My question is, so you're not facing any legal repercussions
01:07:44 of having underage drunk in another country.
01:07:47 My question is, why is it such a big deal
01:07:49 when I fly to the Philippines
01:07:51 to fuck the 12 year old lady boys?
01:07:53 Same logic applies, what's the issue?
01:07:55 Literally, what's the problem?
01:07:57 Well, I think the answer is, is there isn't.
01:08:00 I think you've just asked for a rhetorical question
01:08:02 to give people a good point. Okay, great.
01:08:03 Which is the most reasonable point on earth.
01:08:06 Great, great, okay.
01:08:07 Listen, I'm saying that we should legalize grooming children
01:08:10 if the children are also into it.
01:08:11 That's my official statement.
01:08:14 Hard to agree.
01:08:15 Hard to agree.
01:08:16 Hard to agree.
01:08:17 Well, so what else, what else is on people's minds here?
01:08:23 Wait, wait, wait, what's much you're gonna do
01:08:26 is talk about his flight back.
01:08:27 Was there anything to say about that?
01:08:28 Yeah, there's not much of a story.
01:08:31 It just was the worst experience of my life.
01:08:33 Yeah, okay.
01:08:34 Which I'd stayed up the entire night previous,
01:08:36 which was fine and good.
01:08:37 And me and Henry rode to the airport together.
01:08:42 But when we were at the airport,
01:08:44 I checked in and I said my goodbye and I got in,
01:08:47 but I had an aisle seat.
01:08:49 An aisle seat while I was like as sick and like sniveling
01:08:54 and like coughing up a fucking storm,
01:08:55 I had an aisle seat.
01:08:57 And so I squeezed in between these two fucking fat people,
01:09:01 just you know, three pigs in a blanket, you could say.
01:09:05 And I was coughing and I was trying to lean my chair back,
01:09:07 but my chair specifically was broken.
01:09:09 So I couldn't lean my chair back specifically.
01:09:12 Wait, wait, when you said aisle seat,
01:09:13 do you mean you're in the,
01:09:14 are you saying like the aisle or the middle seat?
01:09:15 Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, I'm retarded, yes.
01:09:17 I'm in middle seat.
01:09:18 Okay, that's what I thought.
01:09:19 I'm in middle seat, yeah.
01:09:21 And I couldn't sleep the entire night for 12 hours.
01:09:24 I was just waking up.
01:09:26 I had like a weird like headache,
01:09:28 I think because I sleep deprivation or something.
01:09:32 And I had to keep getting up
01:09:33 because one of the people on the window seat
01:09:34 kept wanting to go to the bathroom.
01:09:35 So I had to keep getting up for them.
01:09:37 Like every 20 fucking minutes, it was a literal nightmare.
01:09:40 I got to Canada and Canada is like a weird,
01:09:43 like I'm almost there, it looks like America,
01:09:46 but it's just wrong enough.
01:09:47 I just want to go home.
01:09:48 Why is everything so hard?
01:09:50 Why do they speak English?
01:09:51 Except they're so different and I hate them all.
01:09:53 And I was cursing the entire continent of Europe
01:09:56 and the entire continent of North America,
01:09:58 Sands America.
01:09:59 And I got through and it was a nightmare
01:10:02 and it was the worst experience in my life.
01:10:03 And I was sick and it sucked.
01:10:04 And that's all I want to say.
01:10:05 Fuck planes, fuck Air Canada.
01:10:08 Oh, oh, I went to the bathroom.
01:10:09 Cause I fucking, cause I was doing a big bathroom
01:10:12 cause I was going to explode and die.
01:10:14 And then someone caught me in line.
01:10:16 There was like a little, there's like a little like,
01:10:17 like bathroom offset that you could do.
01:10:20 And it was like a very like a small,
01:10:21 like not really formed line that was happening.
01:10:24 And I just got like a quick, quick,
01:10:26 tiny wash in my hands and in the bathroom.
01:10:30 And then someone cut cut in front of me
01:10:32 and I had to go back of the line.
01:10:33 I had to go behind like 50 fucking people.
01:10:35 And it was a nightmare and fuck you.
01:10:37 If someone cuts you in line for the next five minutes,
01:10:40 wash and not apply to you and should be able to retaliate
01:10:42 in any way you want.
01:10:43 I agree.
01:10:45 Anyway, that's done.
01:10:46 Munch of podcast over.
01:10:48 I'll take the thousands of dollars
01:10:49 that I receive per, per appearance, 50 K a verse.
01:10:53 I'm going to call it hers.
01:10:57 But Ben was going to say something stupid.
01:10:59 Probably how the fuck you been?
01:11:00 Probably.
01:11:01 Yeah.
01:11:03 Yeah.
01:11:04 I was just mad, just mad.
01:11:05 Looking at Twitter, seeing Trump,
01:11:07 just saw a Trump tweet and it got really upset.
01:11:10 Well, it's almost as uninteresting
01:11:11 as someone's vacation story.
01:11:13 You know, he's just saying that, you know,
01:11:15 Democrat, Congress, women of color
01:11:17 ought to go back to the shit hole countries they come from.
01:11:20 I mean, it's pretty cool.
01:11:21 Harsh but fair.
01:11:22 Harsh but fair.
01:11:23 Tough love is.
01:11:25 How do you, yeah.
01:11:28 Facts and logic.
01:11:30 Don't care about feeling.
01:11:31 That's all I had to say.
01:11:32 Well, I guess I'll just mention that I have become sick
01:11:36 from Munchie being sick at the time he was at my house.
01:11:39 No, no, no, no, no judging because that that just happens.
01:11:44 Well, you'll be happy to know that I got six and six.
01:11:47 So I'm just nice.
01:11:48 Six and then he's going to go home with his family
01:11:51 and his family's going to get sick.
01:11:52 And then the family's going to go home to Sweden.
01:11:54 This cold is literally having like the longest life.
01:11:56 You're a real plague doctor.
01:11:58 And only instead of curing the plague,
01:12:00 you're creating the plague.
01:12:01 You're spreading the play.
01:12:02 It's like it's like it's like a real good combo
01:12:04 in a fighting game.
01:12:05 This this this one virus is going around doing combo moves,
01:12:09 not dying, continuing to spread.
01:12:11 Very cool.
01:12:12 Anyway, the sickness is not the story.
01:12:14 The story I have is just what is it has caused me to think about.
01:12:19 Because, you know, when you're sick, you're sluggish, you're hurdy.
01:12:22 You don't want to do things.
01:12:24 You see how he gets a hurdy.
01:12:26 Yeah, I see how we.
01:12:29 And I have been like not considering working.
01:12:34 And I've been just sitting around watching YouTube videos
01:12:37 and playing games, and I feel like that's fine because I'm sick.
01:12:40 And I've just started playing games that have been in my steam library
01:12:44 for millions of years, hundreds of thousands of years.
01:12:48 I've had these games and I've never even opened them.
01:12:50 And I'm just sort of going through them and like having opinions that the reason
01:12:55 I I never really wanted to do this before, I think was because I wanted to go full
01:13:00 Digi Bro and have a spreadsheet and like, you know, give it a score
01:13:04 so that I could maybe make a video on it later or something.
01:13:09 But because that's sort of like out of my mind
01:13:11 and I'm just sort of brainaddled through sickness, I'm just sort of playing games.
01:13:14 And I'm like, wow, is this what people do with video games as hobby?
01:13:18 What the fuck is pretty fun?
01:13:21 You just got you just open up a little thing and it's just a nice little time
01:13:25 and you just stop when you feel like it.
01:13:27 Dude, I feel the same way, but about like shows like I like this was the thing
01:13:32 that I declared I was going to do has become the media munchie.
01:13:36 I was become the oh, yeah, that's right, actually consume art again.
01:13:39 And I've been doing so.
01:13:40 I've been I've been I've been watching like HBO shows and it's like great.
01:13:45 Like, has anyone ever thought of this before?
01:13:46 Has anyone realized you can like watch art instead of making it?
01:13:49 It's like insane.
01:13:51 It's like actually crazy and I can't believe it.
01:13:53 It's like it's like actually fun.
01:13:54 Like it brings me joy in my in my life.
01:13:57 Yon sounds lame.
01:13:59 It does. It does.
01:14:02 Hey, I can't enjoy things anymore.
01:14:05 I also have been like just getting into dumb reading some comics.
01:14:10 I went on the quick draw discord and I asked for comic recommendations
01:14:15 and I have a big list and one of the big ones was Astro Boy never read that.
01:14:21 But I have, you know, I have some knowledge of it.
01:14:24 I've watched a show of it once when I was young.
01:14:28 Astro Boy is like what I would make.
01:14:31 It feels like Ali youp the comic because of how like it's just
01:14:36 Astro Boy is such a cute character, such a cute design.
01:14:40 And the way Osama Bin Laden draws
01:14:47 like Astro's feet and stuff.
01:14:49 It's just sort of like like gloop feet, like the sort of just
01:14:53 I don't know how to describe it, but it's so free and so like
01:14:57 free of like rigid structure and like body proportions
01:15:01 in like the in the art school sort of like life drawing way.
01:15:05 It all makes sense in its way, but it looks like you could just scribble it
01:15:09 and I guess that's why he's so such a genius
01:15:12 because it looks so palatable and appetizing.
01:15:16 I just want to eat it.
01:15:18 But I don't want to eat it.
01:15:19 I want to eat it with my eyes and I want to read it.
01:15:22 But it's it's clearly like I haven't tried like emulating the style.
01:15:28 But that is that is very good.
01:15:30 I like Astro Boy.
01:15:32 Also, it's strange how I guess just because it's an old thing.
01:15:37 But the story like the very first story in Astro Boy, the first like chapter,
01:15:42 the volume was like surprisingly in depth and dark and like
01:15:47 twisted and like, whoa, dude, that's fucked up.
01:15:50 I couldn't imagine such a cute character going through such weird shit.
01:15:54 It's the same sort of feeling as seeing like those old Betty Boop cartoons
01:15:58 where there's like some really, you know, before cartoons were quote unquote,
01:16:03 four children. Yeah.
01:16:04 There was a lot of adultish themes in Betty Boop cartoons
01:16:07 and a lot of like almost grotesque imagery just thrown in there.
01:16:11 Betty Boop, the original anime character, unironically.
01:16:14 Yeah. And Astro Boy has that same feeling
01:16:16 where there's like political tensions and like themes of, you know,
01:16:21 all sorts of injustice.
01:16:22 There's this dog in this first one who Astro Boy goes to save.
01:16:26 But it turns out the dog has been killed and his brain has been implanted
01:16:31 into a cyborg robot.
01:16:33 And a lot of the the character of this dog
01:16:37 is that he has to try and get over his programming that he is a cyborg
01:16:41 and he has to kill Astro Boy. Oh, my God.
01:16:42 And sort of struggling with this like existential sort of crisis
01:16:47 that he wants to be a dog again, but he can't.
01:16:49 It's not it doesn't like end with him just being a dog.
01:16:51 I think it does.
01:16:53 Yeah, like it's a goof.
01:16:55 It's goofy as fuck because certain things is like all the other
01:16:59 like cyborgs are also have dog brains.
01:17:01 So he has to when he's in like a kerfuffle, but he knows he's a dog.
01:17:06 So he goes, oh, and he gets all the cyborgs on his side.
01:17:11 And like there was a bit where the word sit will force the cyborgs to stop.
01:17:16 And, you know, the evil villains like, well, what is my henchmen doing?
01:17:20 They're sitting when people say sit.
01:17:22 That's not how they're supposed to work is that you use dog brains, you idiot.
01:17:26 Yeah, it's it's it's great.
01:17:29 Go read Astro Boy.
01:17:30 I think there's a there's lots of places you can read it.
01:17:32 You know, did you just made a video?
01:17:34 Oh, yeah, did you just made a video?
01:17:36 I forget what it's his video.
01:17:37 Don't skip the classics.
01:17:39 And I enjoy that video very much.
01:17:41 And it was basically about how there's a new anime out.
01:17:44 I can't remember and it's not in the description.
01:17:45 So I fucking forget what anime it is.
01:17:47 But it's an Osamu Tezuka.
01:17:49 I don't know what the fucking name of the thing is.
01:17:51 So they just made an anime adaptation of it and did you watched it?
01:17:54 And he had like read the original and like you can see in the thumbnail
01:17:58 like the difference between the two.
01:18:00 And he was like, yeah, like the new anime is like, it's fine.
01:18:02 It's OK, but the original has such like an interesting style
01:18:08 that was of its time and is like, you know, it's fucking Betty Boop.
01:18:11 It's Osamu Tezuka, like from his from his heyday.
01:18:13 And the new one is like that only like they shear away all the like
01:18:18 classical trappings like of that era and a lot of that stuff.
01:18:22 And they just they put it in the context of like our current
01:18:26 understanding of like how anime like quote should be made with modern
01:18:30 stands or whatever.
01:18:31 But in that process, so much is lost.
01:18:34 And like if you just look just that thumbnail shows the difference
01:18:37 in style between the two and you can see it is not even close to looking
01:18:41 like what the original looked like.
01:18:43 And he talks about like a bunch of the he just shows like art from the original.
01:18:47 And he's like, wouldn't it be great if like imagine if they made this?
01:18:50 They adapted this anime.
01:18:52 But they are like one of the primary goals was to adapt the style of that time
01:18:56 to like keep it looking like that rather than trying to fit it into our,
01:19:00 you know, current understanding of how things should look.
01:19:02 And even that even that other show that was made that anime
01:19:05 about the the what is it like the sex tuplets or whatever the the boys.
01:19:09 It's like a comedy adapted action that was like adapted for their modern style.
01:19:13 And the art style like kind of resembled the original.
01:19:16 But even that was changed a lot.
01:19:18 But like to really keep to the original art style is is something that I mean,
01:19:22 you'd have to go way out of your way and would be probably very challenging to do,
01:19:25 which is why they don't do that.
01:19:27 It's you know, it's a lot of work and it's like the stylization of like red line.
01:19:30 Now that has to be on that level or anything.
01:19:32 But I mean, yeah, obviously classic stuff.
01:19:35 First of all, not only is it not necessarily bad.
01:19:38 People have been writing stories for thousands of years.
01:19:40 They're pretty good at it.
01:19:41 It's not like we magically got so much better in the last, you know,
01:19:44 fifty hundred years or whatever.
01:19:46 We though our standards are set based on what we've consumed in that time.
01:19:50 But yeah, there's just a lot to be gained from, I don't know,
01:19:55 recognizing the value and the specific qualities of art from its time.
01:19:59 And that's that's pretty neat.
01:20:00 That's that's a lot of why I'm not too into just like, you know,
01:20:04 this kind of remake stuff and they're called classics for a reason.
01:20:07 They've withstood the test of time.
01:20:09 You know, I've read almost no Tezuka,
01:20:12 but I've always wanted to read Phoenix and Astro Boy.
01:20:15 I should get in on that shit.
01:20:16 Oh, I'm a big Blackjack fan,
01:20:18 but I've actually watched the like anime adaptations of more recent years
01:20:21 from like the nineties and shit of Blackjack.
01:20:23 So that shit's good.
01:20:24 Well, I mean, we went to the British Museum and there was exhibit,
01:20:28 a whole exhibit on manga that we saw.
01:20:31 It was really, really great.
01:20:32 It was a really fantastic exhibit.
01:20:35 And in it, we were just there was just a bunch of like there was a section
01:20:39 like the main section was just there's manga for everyone.
01:20:42 And there was just it was just showcasing the best of each genre that there was.
01:20:46 There was like a sports section.
01:20:47 There was like adventure and there's stuff like that.
01:20:49 And one piece was one of them.
01:20:50 And I was just looking at one piece in like just just I was just reading
01:20:54 a little bit of one piece that just had a page.
01:20:57 And it clicked in my mind that I didn't really consider it all
01:20:59 because I don't I didn't really just even really think of one piece.
01:21:02 But like one piece looks like perfect, like it visually looks like everything
01:21:08 that I've always wanted my art to look like.
01:21:10 And it like looks perfect.
01:21:12 Like like like it resonates with me so much.
01:21:17 And I had never even like considered like, oh, maybe I should read one piece.
01:21:21 Yeah, maybe it's easy to get lost and forget about that.
01:21:24 Yeah, it's just like for all this shit we talk about like the podcast,
01:21:28 like the political situation, the specific interaction of the characters and what not.
01:21:32 But like, frankly, that's all good.
01:21:33 And I enjoy it very much.
01:21:34 But like just the classic going to a new world, like seeing just that double
01:21:38 wide double page spread of like this new land and just I mean, Oda loves doing that shit.
01:21:44 I remember the shout of like when they first saw Fishman Island after the time skip.
01:21:48 And that was like it's like this crazy like underwater bubble world where they went through this
01:21:52 like they've been they traveling through this underwater current.
01:21:55 And like it was dark and spooky.
01:21:56 They're all these monsters, but they get to this one place where there's
01:21:58 like a magical light beaming down from above.
01:22:01 And it's just this it's just like, oh, my God, there's so much adventure
01:22:04 that awaits us in this new world.
01:22:06 And people have various thoughts about Fishman Island.
01:22:07 But like that's oh, I love that stuff.
01:22:10 That's that's the best they had like a lot of originals for of
01:22:15 Manga panels and stuff from from Tezuka and Kira Toriyama
01:22:21 and one piece and all that Naruto.
01:22:23 They had a bit of Jojo in there.
01:22:25 I took some pictures.
01:22:26 If you go to my Instagram.
01:22:27 Oh, yeah. A few put a link to that.
01:22:30 The original original pages from like Dragon Ball and stuff.
01:22:36 And you're able to see like the sketch layers on these original pages.
01:22:41 And it was and you were able to see how they colored in the black.
01:22:44 You're able to see the unevenness of some of the like the colored in black
01:22:48 black blotches.
01:22:49 It was incredible.
01:22:51 It was incredible because you always just think, oh, like when you read
01:22:55 a manga, like everything's so even and black and everything.
01:22:58 So it looks like it was it was chiseled by a God.
01:23:01 But but seeing that like, no, a human made this a human made mistakes in some ways.
01:23:05 And there's like a sketch layer underneath.
01:23:07 So it was guiding him.
01:23:08 This is why, dude, this is why I one of the many reasons why I
01:23:12 prefer manga so much to animate, generally speaking.
01:23:15 It yeah, it's it has exactly that human core feel of like a man
01:23:20 slaved over this and worked to convey his emotions through pictures.
01:23:25 And yeah, it like you feel his presence like in every panel of a manga drawn,
01:23:31 whereas like the anime adaptation, it's like, no, no, no, like someone shit this
01:23:35 out because it was like their monthly quota and they like had to get these
01:23:38 frames animated and they don't even look that good because they're in-betweens.
01:23:42 No, not not much love was put into any individual moment of this
01:23:46 outside like the key frames sometimes.
01:23:48 But I feel the love so much more strongly in manga.
01:23:51 That's why it's my I mean, I haven't seen any like
01:23:53 manga pages in real life, like the actual like versions.
01:23:57 But like in college, we went to a comic exhibit and we saw Dave Sim's work on
01:24:03 Cerebus, like the originals, like there's just one awesome cover for the
01:24:07 Cerebus volume.
01:24:09 I think it's three church and state volume one.
01:24:12 And it's just as huge because like in that volume, like Cerebus basically becomes
01:24:16 the pope and it's like a huge breakdown of like religion and stuff.
01:24:19 So there's this big picture of him, like on top of this building preaching
01:24:22 to like hundreds of people in like a crowd.
01:24:25 And that's like the cover of the book.
01:24:26 And I always thought it was super cool.
01:24:27 And they had the original.
01:24:28 You could see like the like like Zipotone stickers like up cut and
01:24:33 applied on this page.
01:24:34 And the page was huge compared to what it is on the book.
01:24:36 You could see all the details and like I came everywhere because it was the
01:24:39 best moment of my life.
01:24:40 You're just a small point on this.
01:24:42 It's just that when I when I prepare the podcast thumbnails, I do a lot of work
01:24:46 like cutting out the white and like pasting the images on there.
01:24:49 So I've I've actually spent a lot of time like actually
01:24:52 there's even actually even in the in the very last podcast thumbnail, there's
01:24:56 if you look on the on the most right side of it, in fact, let me get a link to it.
01:25:00 There's there's the guy's hat of the Kappa Kawamatsu, the Kappa who was revealed in that.
01:25:06 His hat was cut off on the edge.
01:25:09 So what I did was like, oh, that doesn't look good.
01:25:11 I actually I redrew just that does not exist the edge of his hat.
01:25:15 So like so that's just the kind of thing.
01:25:16 And I've done actually done that a lot making these thumbnails over the years
01:25:20 of like redrawing.
01:25:21 So I've actually almost done some like actual redrawing work the way that
01:25:24 like scan laders do when they're turning this into English and whatnot.
01:25:28 So I feel like I pretty intimately am down with with the manga pages.
01:25:32 And when you zoom in real close, when you're like cutting out white or you're
01:25:35 trying to crop out things, you can see like those little splotches,
01:25:38 those like little tiny details that you never see as you're burning through
01:25:42 trying to get like, oh, what devil fruits revealed?
01:25:44 Like what what are the big character interactions?
01:25:46 But when you zoom in, you hone in, that's that's what I really mean.
01:25:49 It's like, oh, that's splotch.
01:25:51 He probably didn't even put that there intentionally.
01:25:53 But this is just like from the pen, from his ink of like drawing
01:25:56 the outline of this character.
01:25:57 There's like a little detail there that I don't know.
01:26:00 It's a little silly, but it's like, I feel like like, oh, this is like me,
01:26:03 like really communicating intimately with the guy who made this.
01:26:07 Like I'm seeing details that most people don't see when they're
01:26:10 just skimming through this and I feel a real close connection.
01:26:14 And I love it sometimes draw things that are missing.
01:26:19 Or like covered by text or speech bubbles in poddika thumbnails.
01:26:22 And it's really cool.
01:26:24 Like, except for armadillos thumbnails.
01:26:26 Yeah, just adding the little adding the little bit in and be like,
01:26:29 you know what, it pretty much looks like it fits.
01:26:32 That's cool.
01:26:33 Maybe I could do a drawing one of these days.
01:26:35 Maybe, maybe.
01:26:38 Also, they had Man Ben playing on a little TV in that exhibition, which is cool.
01:26:43 What? What's that?
01:26:43 What?
01:26:44 Mine then.
01:26:45 In the wild.
01:26:47 And yeah, on the TV in the manga exhibition with subtitles.
01:26:50 And I was like, oh, you could watch a little episode of that.
01:26:53 I wonder if any more episodes have been translated.
01:26:56 Probably not because like one comes out every six months.
01:26:59 What's Mon Ben again?
01:27:00 It's that show where the guy puts the camera in another manga artist's
01:27:05 studio and films him for a week.
01:27:07 And then at the end of the week, they like watch the footage and like talk
01:27:10 about it and discuss shit.
01:27:14 That's related to the craft.
01:27:17 Big quotation marks.
01:27:20 Man, you guys know about Facebook ad auto-generated shirts?
01:27:24 I don't think so.
01:27:25 Yeah, unfortunately, you know, my brother, my brother showed me this.
01:27:30 I don't know whether it's the same thing, but like a shitpost
01:27:32 generated t-shirt design thing where you can actually buy the shitpost
01:27:36 generated shirts.
01:27:37 I just saw, I just saw a retweet of a picture of one in the wild
01:27:41 that says, I'm the lucky one.
01:27:44 This is this is the whole shirt.
01:27:46 I'm the lucky one.
01:27:47 I have a crazy boyfriend who happens to cuss a lot.
01:27:50 He was born in August.
01:27:52 He has tattoos and he has anger issues and serious dislike for stupid people.
01:28:00 You hurt me and they'll never find your body.
01:28:03 Yes, he bought me this shirt.
01:28:05 Oh, OK, that's totally just like I'm the proud son of a mom.
01:28:10 Yes, you bought me this shirt. It's literally my shirt.
01:28:12 I'll post it in the in the channel.
01:28:15 There you go.
01:28:16 There have been a lot of shirts like that where it's it's like a very
01:28:18 hyper specific, like like SoundCloud, like there's there's another one.
01:28:22 I see another one that's about a grand like thinking thinking I'm just a spoiled
01:28:26 child was your first mistake.
01:28:28 I'm a spoiled grandson of a crazy grandma.
01:28:31 She is also a grumpy old woman who has anger issues and a serious dislike
01:28:35 for stupid people.
01:28:36 You hurt me and they'll never find your body.
01:28:38 Yes, she bought me this shirt.
01:28:39 So like there's like there's like chunks of that get like recycled and
01:28:42 yeah, yeah, and matched up.
01:28:45 Fascinating. What is great is Facebook is terrifying over there.
01:28:51 They got the algorithms.
01:28:53 It's a book with every every face in the face.
01:28:56 If you have a face, they know it's like it's like that guy from Avatar,
01:29:00 the Last Ambender, who steals the faces.
01:29:02 Oh, yeah, that's a great way in the in the in the Facebook headquarters.
01:29:06 There is an entire room like floor that is just is a field of wheat.
01:29:12 Yeah. Yeah.
01:29:13 And is this true?
01:29:14 Yeah, no, this is true.
01:29:15 And in the middle, in the middle of the offices,
01:29:18 Mark Zuckerberg has an office in the exact middle of Facebook HQ.
01:29:24 And in his office is a giant glass cube that you can see inside of his
01:29:29 office at all times.
01:29:30 I'm not Google search it right now.
01:29:32 I'm not fucking with you.
01:29:33 Maybe this is a safety mechanism to make sure he never touches his dick
01:29:37 and he can't be caught.
01:29:38 He'll never be tempted because everyone's watching.
01:29:40 This this is the best shirt.
01:29:41 This is this is the best shirt.
01:29:43 That's a best shirt.
01:29:45 I'm not just a father to an amazing daughter.
01:29:48 I'm also a veteran who did four tours in Iraq and I have chronic diarrhea.
01:29:55 I think that's a baby tanks flanking veteran really bring the whole design together.
01:30:01 Yeah, it does look quite small.
01:30:06 Isn't that like a woman's t-shirt?
01:30:08 It looks like a baby.
01:30:10 I don't know about that.
01:30:11 Maybe it's a woman's tea.
01:30:12 Yeah, I'm looking for this glass cube.
01:30:15 I can't I can't see it.
01:30:17 Oh, I should mark Mark Zuckerberg glass office cube.
01:30:21 I'm OK.
01:30:22 I don't know how these are generated.
01:30:24 But I wonder if like it's there, though.
01:30:26 Trust me, do they will it like will Facebook here?
01:30:29 No, we'll Facebook like look at will Facebook like look at your profile,
01:30:33 like take your information and then like generate a shirt to show you specifically
01:30:41 based on like the things you've maybe or post.
01:30:44 That's my guess or whatever.
01:30:46 Like was like was this generated by Facebook for someone who has a dad
01:30:51 who did four tours in Iraq and has like liked posts.
01:30:54 I don't think he's generated by Facebook.
01:30:56 I would assume that this is like an algorithm by some company
01:30:59 or some like, you know, reseller t-shirt company buying Facebook ads.
01:31:04 Because I know like this is like an evolution.
01:31:06 Like the basic Pokemon version of this that I was aware of was you just
01:31:10 you get shirts that have like people's names on them and have like cute little
01:31:15 like dumb, normie core phrases around someone's name.
01:31:18 Like I'm Ben, I'm the coolest.
01:31:20 And then you run a Facebook ad that's like if the person's name is Ben,
01:31:24 run this ad and then the Ben like dumb Ben is like, I'm Ben and then they buy the shirt.
01:31:29 There is a relatively simple explanation.
01:31:31 Finally, a shirt just for me.
01:31:33 I mean, I've seen many shirts like this, frankly, in like the Asian world
01:31:36 where people who just don't speak English that well, they buy shirts in English
01:31:39 because like it's supposed to be kind of cool or whatever.
01:31:42 I've seen many of those.
01:31:45 No, this is not the work of someone who doesn't speak English.
01:31:48 This is this is the work.
01:31:49 Well, OK, well, maybe.
01:31:50 And I'm just one and I'm just wondering what who is running the algorithm
01:31:54 and where is it getting the data and how Facebook ad lecture literally went.
01:32:00 Like, like are these are these generated from an individual's data
01:32:05 and then advertised to them and like like generated
01:32:09 or are they or or well, I mean, that or are they simply like a complete mishmash
01:32:15 of concepts that are just sort of sprayed out onto the Internet
01:32:19 and like advertised at random in the hopes that one will just perfectly
01:32:23 describe somebody who can say, I just don't know.
01:32:25 We got to wait for the Vsauce video to explain it all.
01:32:29 That's very true.
01:32:30 So so it's like this.
01:32:32 Is it time for voicemails?
01:32:33 Is it is a time now?
01:32:34 I feel like it is.
01:32:36 I think it might be. Sure.
01:32:39 Yeah, sure.
01:32:40 Now, OK, before we go to proper voicemails,
01:32:42 there's there's like an update from some individuals.
01:32:45 So let's let's just play this.
01:32:46 This this doesn't count.
01:32:47 This isn't a real voicemail.
01:32:49 But this is from Mark it did.
01:32:51 Mark it did. OK. Commence.
01:32:53 Hello and welcome to market.
01:32:55 How do they market at market doing how the market do fuck?
01:32:57 Sorry, we haven't promoted our dating seminar a while,
01:33:00 but that is going to change right the fuck now.
01:33:02 We promise the thing and we will deliver.
01:33:05 We will birth the Sprovian bottle and biographical bitch, baby,
01:33:08 right onto your lap as you stare and disgust and confusion.
01:33:11 And then, well, we'll see what happens then.
01:33:14 I guess what I'm trying to say is follow at PCP
01:33:17 dating on Twitter to motherfucking stay informed,
01:33:19 stay vigilant, stay updated.
01:33:21 This is a signing out.
01:33:23 OK, there you go. Update.
01:33:24 Follow. What was it happening?
01:33:25 PCP dating, Sam, or is a PCP dating?
01:33:28 Whatever he said, that's the one.
01:33:30 It's at it's at PCP.
01:33:32 Dating is the official one, the full right. OK, OK.
01:33:36 And last last update was some new Tommy.
01:33:40 Indeed. Oh, I saw that on July 12th.
01:33:43 It's pretty, pretty great.
01:33:46 I can't believe this is two days ago from from today's.
01:33:49 Well, I'm glad I'm glad that's I mean, I'm glad they're still going to.
01:33:53 I expect it instantly.
01:33:55 Oh, by the way, so in contrast to that, that was fine.
01:33:58 The dating sim's cool.
01:33:59 I have to give a verbal lambasting to one I'll die of the I'll die
01:34:05 corporation, your voicemail.
01:34:07 OK, look, we've been we've been softballing you for a while.
01:34:10 I'll die because they, you know, they were fine.
01:34:12 The Robo voice thing was cool.
01:34:14 The voicemail was you sent this time.
01:34:16 It was fine. It was fine.
01:34:17 But the problem was it was a fucking like the topic that you said
01:34:21 and you talk about with your Robo for a while was fine.
01:34:24 I know this was sent by an algorithm and you're not to blame,
01:34:27 but it just turns into a fucking ad to like follow you on Twitter at the end.
01:34:32 Like what the fuck was that?
01:34:33 It was like just some please follow me.
01:34:36 Like it was a tease, like the subject for like this project they're working on.
01:34:40 And I just like, oh, my God, there's nothing that makes me want to puke
01:34:43 more than these like just advertising their own project, like in a voicemail.
01:34:49 So I'm tempted to go PCP voice jail for that one.
01:34:53 You you you you've played you've played voicemails that do exactly.
01:34:58 When they're entertaining, that's fine.
01:35:00 As long as it's entertaining, anything is fine.
01:35:03 But this was, I mean, mediocre.
01:35:05 And also like if you'd listen to it, it was just an ad.
01:35:08 It just go go to the speak pipe and listen to it.
01:35:11 Just not great.
01:35:12 Just very reprehensible and rethink your your life.
01:35:16 Please, please, that's it.
01:35:19 Maybe I'm wrong.
01:35:19 You guys can correct me, but I just thought it was simply terrible.
01:35:23 So and follow and follow.
01:35:25 I'll die for that.
01:35:26 I'll die three, one, four on Twitter.
01:35:28 Indeed, I thought it was particularly egregious.
01:35:30 But OK, so that's that.
01:35:32 That's out of the way.
01:35:33 Let's get some quality content.
01:35:35 We've got the that's all that I'll die three, one, four on.
01:35:40 OK, analog signal audio demon is calling in.
01:35:43 So let's see what he has to say and go.
01:35:50 I am the audio demons.
01:35:54 I am a demon that can curse your audio to make it sound like shit.
01:36:01 Oh, no, I don't need it.
01:36:03 I will need you all to state your age.
01:36:08 Twenty nine, twenty nine.
01:36:10 Eighteen, huh?
01:36:11 Which one of you is the eldest?
01:36:15 I think it's Ben.
01:36:16 I think it's Ben.
01:36:17 Yeah, it's me.
01:36:18 It's me for the next 30 seconds.
01:36:21 You will be cursed with flanger starting now.
01:36:29 Oh, no, Ben, you sound so fucked up.
01:36:31 What? Oh, no.
01:36:33 Well, well, well, well, well, well.
01:36:35 Say something Ben, say it would say.
01:36:37 I can't think of anything that I would say.
01:36:40 Say something about communism.
01:36:41 It's too horrendous.
01:36:43 OK, I think the time's over.
01:36:45 There you go. Am I cursed? Am I cursed now?
01:36:47 You fucking wasted that, Ben, man.
01:36:49 I'm angry at you.
01:36:50 You wasted that so fucking hard.
01:36:51 You didn't say literally anything.
01:36:54 What? I'm sorry.
01:36:57 Yeah, you fucking should be.
01:36:59 This guy cursed you under the trouble of cursing you,
01:37:01 trying to locate who the eldest person was.
01:37:03 He came in here with the intent to put a magic spell on you.
01:37:06 And only because we were like, oh, what do I say?
01:37:09 Yeah, pretty, pretty bad.
01:37:10 Literally anything.
01:37:11 Pretty terrible.
01:37:12 But can we put Ben the voice jail?
01:37:14 It's not, it's not.
01:37:14 Michael, this fucking dumb spell didn't work.
01:37:17 Well, maybe maybe with a little editing magic.
01:37:20 Blame the blame the player, not the game or something.
01:37:25 Well, OK, Ben's dead.
01:37:26 Let's move on.
01:37:27 We've got a voicemail.
01:37:28 OK, this is from one doopity schmoople.
01:37:31 You know him, you love him.
01:37:32 My first. Let's see what he has to say.
01:37:33 Let's see what he has to say and go.
01:37:36 Hey, guys, you're here.
01:37:39 Yeah, I'm just calling in to ask for advice,
01:37:42 because apparently that's what the show is for.
01:37:44 They always say that.
01:37:45 Basically, stop saying that.
01:37:47 I'm almost 18, getting ready to move out.
01:37:50 And I don't know what to do.
01:37:55 Not sure if I want to go to college or not.
01:37:57 Not sure if I don't.
01:37:59 If you don't know, don't want to.
01:38:01 I don't even have a job, so I don't know
01:38:03 if I'm going to pay myself.
01:38:06 Don't know if I should stay here for a couple more years or what.
01:38:10 Wait, that's.
01:38:12 I do I want to be in this,
01:38:14 but I haven't really drawn anything.
01:38:16 So do I want to be in this?
01:38:18 OK, I got it. I got it.
01:38:20 Yeah. I don't know.
01:38:22 Just asking.
01:38:23 OK, you've given us zero information.
01:38:26 Yeah, like what do you do?
01:38:29 What does he mean that I'm getting ready to move out?
01:38:31 But I don't know if I'm going to college.
01:38:34 I don't have a job.
01:38:35 I don't know if maybe I should just stay here.
01:38:37 Yeah, don't you have a plan for, I mean, moving out requires finances.
01:38:41 I mean, obviously, don't move out until you know where you're going.
01:38:45 I think that's what he was saying at the end,
01:38:47 like maybe I'll just stay here.
01:38:48 So I assume that's not set in stone yet.
01:38:50 OK, hold on.
01:38:51 I as as Jupiter's father, who he would be moving from in this area.
01:38:57 Right, right.
01:38:57 I had no idea that you were leaving the rough house, but you know, that's fine.
01:39:01 We all got to spread our rings somehow.
01:39:03 Got to spread our O-ring sometime.
01:39:06 First of all, if you want to become an artist, but you haven't drawn before,
01:39:09 put that I'm not going to say on the backburn and since it like,
01:39:12 don't try and do it.
01:39:13 But in the sense that like, don't be like, oh, you know,
01:39:16 like I'll make a living being an artist.
01:39:18 I'll just get around to drawing someday.
01:39:20 Like, no, you have to start drawing today.
01:39:23 Today, I'll make my Patreon and post like something today.
01:39:26 And then tomorrow, it'll be a job.
01:39:29 Yeah, yeah.
01:39:30 OK, so that's a possibility for tomorrow's dupity.
01:39:35 You have to start today, drawing so that you can be ready
01:39:39 to make a living off it in five years.
01:39:42 So yeah, you should have been doing this your entire.
01:39:45 I don't even know, like, surely there's another way that you could be doing this.
01:39:48 I can't believe that you would think that you can just like start doing it
01:39:51 and we'll be fine.
01:39:52 Not everyone's been saying and been saying was doing it.
01:39:55 But like, it's not even true.
01:39:56 It's like a lie. It's not even real.
01:39:58 He had drawn before it.
01:39:59 Fuck you. Yeah. Not a lie.
01:40:01 I mean, I was I mean, I was way older than Duke when I started like drawing much.
01:40:05 Yeah. I mean, I never drawn a day in my life before that.
01:40:09 You put in years of work before we ever started, like, you know, fine.
01:40:13 Yeah. But less. Yeah.
01:40:14 But less work than a normal human.
01:40:16 Less years than a normal human. Sure.
01:40:18 Sure. But he's put in zero years.
01:40:19 Yeah. Yeah.
01:40:22 You can't work with zero.
01:40:23 Also, if you don't want to go to college, literally don't go to college.
01:40:26 If you do not have an express reason to go to college, you shouldn't go to college.
01:40:30 College is good and it is a useful tool.
01:40:32 And if you come up with a reason to go to college and if you come up with a valid
01:40:34 good reason to go, then of course you should go.
01:40:37 But right now you shouldn't go just for fun or that it's like all the thing to do.
01:40:40 Unless you have a reason to go, don't go. That's obvious.
01:40:43 I mean, college is a tool like any other.
01:40:45 Why would you like, hey, hey, guys, should I pick up a jackhammer?
01:40:49 Just like, I don't like it.
01:40:50 My parents just think that I should.
01:40:52 Should I like just like a pick it up and like, you know, use it on the ground?
01:41:01 Is that the sound it makes?
01:41:02 Yeah, I have a suggestion.
01:41:04 Moving out is a good thing for almost anyone because like staying with your
01:41:08 parents will keep you with the mind of a child.
01:41:11 And like, that's fine.
01:41:12 It just it keeps you from developing like life ownership skills,
01:41:16 which I think are very good to have, frankly, relatively as early as possible.
01:41:21 And like, what's the word I'm looking for?
01:41:22 Like commitment and responsibility.
01:41:24 That's the word I'm looking for.
01:41:25 So I would say like stay with your parents until you can get a job and save up
01:41:30 some money and I would recommend moving out.
01:41:33 But I mean, you've got so little details to what you want to do.
01:41:36 So my suggestion is like work on trying to figure out what you want to do.
01:41:41 And in that, like if you want to be an artist, great.
01:41:44 So practice that in your spare time, but get a job and move out so you can
01:41:48 support yourself, doesn't have to be an amazing job and like get an apartment
01:41:51 somewhere to do that.
01:41:53 You don't know what your life passion is.
01:41:55 Your passion is to try as many things as possible until something collects.
01:41:58 I build up some savings.
01:41:59 You need.
01:42:00 I just want to phrase it in the way that like if you don't have any plan
01:42:04 for what you're doing and you have no job, then don't even think about moving
01:42:07 out because you just will fucking immediately die.
01:42:11 If you have literally how is it going to buy the apartment too early?
01:42:14 It's too early to even think about that right now.
01:42:17 You're obviously not in the position to do that.
01:42:19 I mean, you got to you got to start.
01:42:20 This is like a Maslow's hierarchy.
01:42:22 You have to start with the foundation.
01:42:23 OK, like what do I want with my life?
01:42:25 I want to like live on my own, presumably.
01:42:26 OK, what's required for that money?
01:42:28 OK, what do I need for money?
01:42:29 A job. So OK, got to start with the job, then get the money, then get the apartment.
01:42:35 Yeah, things of this nature to try to think approach things that way.
01:42:39 Let us know. Let us know how it goes.
01:42:42 OK, on to the next one.
01:42:43 Call from Italian boy.
01:42:45 Let's see what he has to say.
01:42:46 OK, go. Hello.
01:42:48 It's Italian boy. Nice.
01:42:50 He's listening.
01:42:51 Thank you for giving us your sweet, sweet cash.
01:42:55 And I just wanted to congratulate you guys for reaching 20,000 subscribers.
01:43:00 Hey, but you don't give a fuck.
01:43:04 And it doesn't matter, but I also don't matter.
01:43:06 So yeah. All right.
01:43:09 Thanks, buddy. What a voice.
01:43:11 OK, what a voice mail.
01:43:12 Why did you play that?
01:43:14 Because he congratulated us and said nice things.
01:43:16 Who reached 3,000?
01:43:18 No, we reached 20,000.
01:43:20 The BCP. Wow.
01:43:22 That's some accent you got there.
01:43:25 OK, I'm going to add
01:43:26 a Italian boy to the PCP Munchy Concerts.
01:43:30 So he is the first PCP Munchy Concerts Italian boy.
01:43:34 Look at you. You're such a European.
01:43:37 Yeah, Italian boy is now my right hand man.
01:43:40 He's my first son in this timeline.
01:43:42 Oh, wow. OK.
01:43:43 Congratulations. All right.
01:43:45 Dupe de disown.
01:43:47 Well, no, no, no, it's a different timeline, it's a different time.
01:43:49 They're separate but equal, separate but equal.
01:43:50 That's that's universe one, five, five.
01:43:53 This is the PCP as opposed to the Sliver.
01:43:57 OK, let's let's kick up the quality with another voicemail from one dumb fuck.
01:44:02 Here we go. I didn't realize I called him. Go listen.
01:44:06 I need some advice on how to be not such a like bumbling retard.
01:44:11 Because every time I listen to my voicemails that I record, I have like a million like,
01:44:17 uh, uh, uh, like a million, like every other word is uh, and then the words that aren't
01:44:26 uh, are like, and I don't know.
01:44:30 It just sounds retarded and really bad, and I need help speaking like a person who speaks
01:44:37 English.
01:44:38 This is a terrible question.
01:44:40 Okay.
01:44:41 He just keeps rambling about this.
01:44:43 The obvious answer is to talk more.
01:44:45 I mean, I was definitely like that before.
01:44:47 No.
01:44:48 I'm still kind of like that, uh, but through talking a lot, I've just gotten better at
01:44:53 not doing it.
01:44:54 Just record it again, and this time don't say those things.
01:44:56 I mean, yeah.
01:44:57 You gotta do a few dry runs first.
01:44:59 I could tell he was trying not to say like an um, in that particular recording, so I guess
01:45:05 he did that.
01:45:06 I know, I know.
01:45:07 This is, I thought this was a good question, because this, I thought it's not even just
01:45:09 for him, but for everybody.
01:45:10 No, this question sucks.
01:45:11 The answer is self-evident.
01:45:12 Well, yeah, it is, but like, here, here's some tangible advice for anybody who feels
01:45:15 this way, because I'm, a lot of your voicemails get weeded out, because you sound like shit.
01:45:20 So if you want to just get to the point, uh, here's what you do.
01:45:23 This is super easy.
01:45:24 You have a computer, get audacity, record your voicemail ahead of time, like just say the
01:45:29 words into audacity, and you will hear back how you sound.
01:45:33 And if you got too many likes and ums, you're like, oh, should I gotta work on that?
01:45:36 Do it again, and try to suppress it.
01:45:38 You'll hear if you succeed or fail, and just keep doing that until you sound good.
01:45:43 And then you're improving your, your speaking overall.
01:45:45 And I feel this, because I do this too much myself when I talk, and I, I haven't done
01:45:49 that.
01:45:50 If you, if you don't have a microphone, and you're using like your discord, your phone,
01:45:55 there's recording apps to say this, yeah, just get a free recording app and just do
01:46:00 the same.
01:46:01 Just listen to yourself until you know what is gross, and then you can feel ashamed about
01:46:05 it and change it.
01:46:06 This isn't showcased on the PCP whatsoever, because PCP is possibly the most highest stake
01:46:12 scenario that one person can talk to, and they're like in all of society, like it has
01:46:17 the most like, like negative consequences for speaking and not as fast as humanly possible.
01:46:23 But what I do in normal life is, this is, this is a life hack for you.
01:46:27 When you want to say um or like, just don't say anything.
01:46:30 Just take a small little pause.
01:46:32 No one will really notice.
01:46:33 You sound smart.
01:46:34 You sound smart.
01:46:35 Yeah, and you sound smart.
01:46:36 That's true.
01:46:37 That's like an actual speaking tip.
01:46:38 And it's not a big deal.
01:46:39 You sound considered.
01:46:40 Yeah.
01:46:41 Uh, okay.
01:46:42 On to the next one.
01:46:43 Uh, Munchy, we have a voicemail from one, the only fly away now has called in with a
01:46:48 voicemail.
01:46:49 Yes.
01:46:50 Yes.
01:46:51 The man himself.
01:46:52 Uh, let's, let's hear.
01:46:53 Go, go, go, go.
01:46:54 The name's a fly away now.
01:46:56 The same guy who has internet clout for some reason, because I was hammering into a presumed
01:47:01 mentally ill future United States Marine for a few years until it was a, I can't discover
01:47:08 it to all be a ruse named Park Road, do 91.
01:47:12 I've been listening to the PCP for a good half a year, even though I heard first heard
01:47:19 of Munchy's lecture on Diggle Nation years before that.
01:47:24 I didn't even watch it fully until the last six months because I wasn't big into a podcast
01:47:28 like things until I realized you guys were angry.
01:47:31 Actually quality.
01:47:32 Oh, thank you.
01:47:35 I'm sorry.
01:47:36 I'm not quirky or trying to be a manic pixie.
01:47:38 No.
01:47:39 Half the other underage liberals sending you stuff, but I actually appreciate the podcast
01:47:44 with all my heart after I watched all the lectures and realized, oh, hey, they talk
01:47:50 weekly, they do it consistently and their degeneracy is personable, even to normies
01:47:56 like me.
01:47:57 So you have, which is far more than any of us deserve.
01:48:01 And when Andrew Yang gets elected, I'll give my monthly bag with a PCP Patreon.
01:48:05 Thank you.
01:48:06 I don't know how you handle guests and whatnot.
01:48:09 I wouldn't mind hopping on for a bit to give you some insight on Lollacows from my perspective
01:48:13 or really just anything, just so I can get Ben to shut the fuck up about politics for
01:48:18 one second.
01:48:19 Dude, this guy's Yang, no, this guy's Yang Yang.
01:48:24 Oh yeah.
01:48:25 Big time.
01:48:26 Big time.
01:48:27 Only, only on the condition that we only talk about Andrew Yang.
01:48:30 Only on the condition that we all vote for Andrew Yang.
01:48:32 Yeah, yeah.
01:48:33 Like live stream.
01:48:34 Oh, dude, Ben, you should totally live stream voting, but anyway, that was, that was lovely.
01:48:39 That was a real human being voicemail.
01:48:43 I just forgot.
01:48:44 Remind me.
01:48:45 What was the flyaways now status?
01:48:46 He was involved with Parkour Dude.
01:48:47 What was his?
01:48:48 He, he, he was, he was affiliated with Team Gamer Food and he was one of the many Islamic
01:48:54 trolls.
01:48:55 I believe, I believe he, he was one of the, he was during, he was present during the
01:49:00 trial of Jace and I can't remember if it was Flyaway Now that pressed Jace on being way
01:49:06 too racist even for trolls or for someone else.
01:49:11 But he was definitely present and he, he, he was part of that crowd.
01:49:15 He was part of the opposition to Jace, the conservative party, to Jace liberal party.
01:49:21 Fantastic.
01:49:22 So, so he was one of the people that, that, that ringed the, the juicy, juicy nectar
01:49:26 of Jace's mouth.
01:49:27 Well, an important, an important job.
01:49:30 An important job.
01:49:31 Yeah.
01:49:32 Yeah.
01:49:33 Part of the reason, part of the reason why I made that lecture, because if it wasn't
01:49:35 for people like him, then Jace would have just kind of wallowed in relevancy.
01:49:39 It wasn't for people purposely trying to provoke him to get him to, if it wasn't for people
01:49:44 engaging with the ARG that Yon had made, then I wouldn't have mattered at all.
01:49:50 It's small world.
01:49:51 Such a small fucking world.
01:49:52 I can't believe it.
01:49:53 I know.
01:49:54 I was looking at that video, 120K views for that, for that little story.
01:50:00 I can't believe it.
01:50:01 I really can.
01:50:02 I love the fucking lectures, man.
01:50:03 They love them.
01:50:04 They guzzle them.
01:50:05 Like water.
01:50:06 Like Chikus.
01:50:07 Well, well, I gotta start preparing for Chris Chan, too, electric Google it.
01:50:12 Oh, are you doing that?
01:50:13 Is that the word?
01:50:15 Oh, yeah.
01:50:17 Everyone agrees that I need to make an update version on everything that happened with Chris
01:50:22 afterwards.
01:50:23 Good idea.
01:50:24 I need to brush up on it myself, because there's a lot.
01:50:28 I mean, a lot has happened, and I only know the broadstrips of it.
01:50:31 Are you going to get first-hand account from BronyCon, since Chris will be there?
01:50:36 I forgot.
01:50:37 Chris Chan is at BronyCon.
01:50:38 He's going to BronyCon.
01:50:39 We will be there.
01:50:42 She's going to BronyCon.
01:50:44 Am I allowed to not take her seriously on this, because she's so unserious in all other
01:50:50 ways?
01:50:51 No, you can't.
01:50:52 You look like a big asshole if you do that, so you can make your own decisions.
01:50:56 But why do I take her word for it, because she seems so confused on all other things
01:51:00 in life?
01:51:01 Well, you really don't want to look like a fucking asshole, and that's the reason.
01:51:08 You're not giving me any actual reason.
01:51:09 That's not much of a point.
01:51:10 You're just saying that it's bad to do it.
01:51:12 Why is it bad?
01:51:14 It's a bad take and a bad look.
01:51:16 Should I also take seriously these claims of the dimensional merge that is happening
01:51:20 like any day now that Chris makes over and over again?
01:51:23 The point of it is that she believes that she is, so if she believes that she is a different
01:51:30 gender, then you've got to respect it.
01:51:32 Obviously, he doesn't respect her in any way.
01:51:33 Just the way I need to respect the dimensional merge claim is I don't understand the distinction.
01:51:37 Shut the fuck up.
01:51:38 Let's talk about something else.
01:51:39 All right.
01:51:40 Anyway, I want to go back to Fly Away Now and just say that I would like to know more about
01:51:46 how you circled back.
01:51:48 Did you just have nothing to do and then watch the lecture to completion and then just six
01:51:52 months ago or something and then you got into it?
01:51:54 I'm surprised.
01:51:55 I'm always surprised that there are people who get into the PCP now and just haven't been
01:52:01 following along for literal years and are just like leftovers from when we actually made
01:52:07 good videos.
01:52:08 It is good to see.
01:52:09 I'm always surprised and you know what, top of the morning to you, as Jeff Septekai would
01:52:16 say.
01:52:17 We poo-poo a lot.
01:52:19 I mean, I certainly do.
01:52:20 This notion that people would even get into the show at all, but I guess it's possible.
01:52:24 I guess it can be done through some mechanisms.
01:52:27 It is a little strange due to the fact that the people on the show vary and the quality
01:52:36 of the shows vary a lot in quality and topic.
01:52:41 The idea of people just seeing one and then seeing another one and finding that there
01:52:47 is not really a link between them necessarily and then continuing to watch them is unexpected
01:52:53 at least.
01:52:54 Too true.
01:52:55 Once you get in the third one, then you're along for the ride, I think.
01:52:59 That makes sense.
01:53:00 You're therefore like the personalities rather than what they're saying or how smartly they're
01:53:05 saying it.
01:53:06 Three's a pattern.
01:53:07 Yeah, you're in the pattern at that point.
01:53:09 And according to this guy, though I doubt his claim that he's actually a normie, but
01:53:14 we even have the normie reach according to him.
01:53:16 Would a normie be one of the people provoking Jayce to...
01:53:19 Yeah.
01:53:20 I'm just saying.
01:53:21 That's kind of as hard to believe.
01:53:22 But maybe.
01:53:23 I mean, there are degrees of going there.
01:53:26 I'll take that at face value due to the fact that he just left a voicemail.
01:53:31 It was not like a voice comedy routine.
01:53:35 That's true.
01:53:36 There's degrees of being normie.
01:53:37 It was refreshing to see just like a normal fucking human speak to me.
01:53:42 Imagine.
01:53:43 Imagine.
01:53:44 It wasn't this drawn out like voice recording that was fucked to hell in audacity.
01:53:49 Well, speaking, speaking of...
01:53:51 Oh, yeah.
01:53:52 I was really refreshing.
01:53:53 I mean, you can't wait to see it.
01:53:55 That brief respite is over.
01:53:57 Our next voicemail is went on a date with a milf.
01:54:01 And let's hear how that goes.
01:54:02 Damn.
01:54:04 No.
01:54:05 Guys.
01:54:06 Guys.
01:54:07 That's quality women's, dude.
01:54:08 Hello.
01:54:09 Guys, I just got back from a date with a milf, dude.
01:54:12 Nice.
01:54:13 Oh, my fucking...
01:54:14 I'm in a Cougar Life account because I've always been in older women because they're
01:54:19 much more mature and fucking stable.
01:54:22 Like yourself.
01:54:23 Most women my age.
01:54:24 Most women our age.
01:54:25 Ben St. listen to this shit.
01:54:26 She was amazing.
01:54:27 She was amazing.
01:54:28 She was amazing, dude.
01:54:29 She was 50.
01:54:30 She was 50.
01:54:31 She was a career woman.
01:54:33 She's a lawyer.
01:54:34 She writes grants.
01:54:36 She's amazing.
01:54:37 She's fucking amazing.
01:54:38 She's beautiful.
01:54:39 And I just went on a fucking date with her and I thought Cougar Life was a scam, dude.
01:54:43 Every fucking account was like fake accounts and then all of a sudden she was like two
01:54:46 and a half hours away.
01:54:48 She drove like two hours here because apparently she commutes all the time, dude.
01:54:52 She's fucking amazing.
01:54:53 She's amazing.
01:54:54 And we're going to fucking bang, dude, on the second or third date, I think we're going
01:54:58 to bang.
01:54:59 She was going to get a hotel down here and she was going to stay there because she was
01:55:03 going to go to the beach the next morning.
01:55:05 But oh my God, she's so fucking sexy.
01:55:06 Change your batteries.
01:55:07 Change your smoke detector.
01:55:08 She has a shit ton of money.
01:55:09 She travels everywhere.
01:55:11 She's so mature.
01:55:12 Ben St., man.
01:55:13 I'm telling you, you're a broke ass nigga.
01:55:14 You've got to find yourself a fucking milf, man.
01:55:16 They're amazing.
01:55:17 They're fucking amazing.
01:55:18 They could be your sugar mamas, man.
01:55:21 My God.
01:55:22 She's amazing.
01:55:23 I'm going to keep you guys updated if I bang her.
01:55:25 Thanks.
01:55:26 I'll call back.
01:55:27 Yeah, dude.
01:55:28 I'm drunk out of my fucking mind right now.
01:55:29 Dude, call in while banging.
01:55:30 It was a surreal night.
01:55:31 Yeah, good idea.
01:55:32 I can't believe she was even real.
01:55:33 And we fucking met up.
01:55:34 Holy shit.
01:55:35 Is this real?
01:55:36 What do we think, guys?
01:55:37 Is this real or what?
01:55:38 I think that...
01:55:39 The story doesn't sound too unbelievable.
01:55:40 100% real.
01:55:41 I think he met someone who was 50.
01:55:48 That seems within the realm of possibility.
01:55:51 But like everything...
01:55:52 Well, I mean...
01:55:53 I mean, he was drunk at the time.
01:55:55 Is this a glowing...
01:55:57 Or should we necessarily take all this as like a possible, like we should follow this
01:56:01 life advice?
01:56:02 I mean, probably not.
01:56:04 I'm sure it's...
01:56:05 I've never dated a cougar who was 50 or even close.
01:56:07 And they're on cougarlife.com.
01:56:08 So, I mean, it's one way to go.
01:56:11 Ben, I mean, I know that you're a mill flover and that's your license plate number.
01:56:15 Are you going to follow this?
01:56:16 Yeah.
01:56:17 That's right.
01:56:18 Yeah, you know what?
01:56:21 You're...
01:56:22 Yeah.
01:56:23 This is actually...
01:56:24 You got me.
01:56:25 I'm on cougarlife right now, signing up for an account.
01:56:29 It's the right thing to do.
01:56:31 Me and quality women, we're going to converse.
01:56:34 We're going to...
01:56:35 Well, we'll trade notes.
01:56:36 All right?
01:56:37 DM me.
01:56:38 Sounds good.
01:56:39 Excellent.
01:56:40 Good luck.
01:56:41 Man, guys, quality women has really just grown out of a shell, you know?
01:56:43 He's gone from being stereotypical.
01:56:44 You know what?
01:56:45 He's been stereotypical.
01:56:46 He was so...
01:56:47 He was so conflicted and now he's found peace.
01:56:50 Yeah.
01:56:51 Yeah.
01:56:52 He's been stereotypical like, oh, my girlfriend's so fucking crazy.
01:56:53 What a bitch.
01:56:54 He's just, you know, banging milks a day and day on cougarlife with their hands full.
01:56:59 What a...
01:57:00 What an arc.
01:57:01 What an arc we've been privy to.
01:57:03 Just...
01:57:04 I mean, imagine.
01:57:05 Just imagine you meet someone online and then the entire time you're talking and you're
01:57:08 just thinking, oh, women, we have sex, women, we only have sex.
01:57:11 That's the mark of a real genius.
01:57:13 Isn't that how every online interaction goes?
01:57:15 I thought that was just normal.
01:57:17 Most of them.
01:57:18 Most of them.
01:57:19 Okay, let's move on.
01:57:20 We've got a short...
01:57:21 Great job.
01:57:22 Well, actually...
01:57:23 Before we move on, I just want to say that I was looking at...
01:57:26 I was just checking the comments of the deletion lecture and then I started to absentmindedly
01:57:30 just scrolling through the PCP.
01:57:31 And I just...
01:57:32 Just a small little point here on Chewbacca's Osamonga Dio.
01:57:36 It says that the location where you filmed it in is the Gardens of Vatican City.
01:57:41 You can click here and it will be above the title.
01:57:43 We were recording the Chewbacca's in the Gardens of Vatican City, according to...
01:57:47 That's a lot.
01:57:48 Yeah, yeah.
01:57:49 Very nice.
01:57:50 Cool.
01:57:51 Fantastic.
01:57:52 Okay.
01:57:53 Let's move on.
01:57:54 We've got...
01:57:55 Okay.
01:57:56 Now, this is one of these things I don't normally do, but this is good enough.
01:57:57 It's Anifred's application for the Teen CP.
01:58:01 So I think Anifred is literally 13, right?
01:58:03 So he's just barely...
01:58:04 Yeah, no, he really is, yeah.
01:58:05 Okay.
01:58:06 All right.
01:58:07 Let's set him up.
01:58:08 We have no involvement as the PCP, but Teen CP, listen up.
01:58:10 Let's see if he's got what you need.
01:58:11 Oh, he's an Anifred.
01:58:12 It's about time we've got some English blood on the Teen CP.
01:58:14 Chewboy, Anifred.
01:58:15 Let's go.
01:58:16 It's Chewboy, Anifred.
01:58:17 We've had a gun and I'll shoot you dead in your dungeon with dead mom.
01:58:20 It was red.
01:58:21 If we steal your dad, because I'm a hardcore lad, I'll make you a fucking chad.
01:58:24 Talk about pride.
01:58:25 What are you proud for?
01:58:26 You've got an anime vid in a lanky hall, kick down the door, so I'm calling.
01:58:29 If you're a woman, then don't join.
01:58:31 You can chew on my pork loin.
01:58:32 Now watch for your zoom.
01:58:33 Crack that soul, Anifred.
01:58:34 Boy, I get it all.
01:58:35 I'm ready for a brawl at your Teen CP.
01:58:39 You know what to call.
01:58:40 Don't stall.
01:58:41 Yeah.
01:58:42 Yay.
01:58:43 Anifred, you know.
01:58:44 Another masterpiece.
01:58:45 Anifred keeps knocking out of the part with his regimen.
01:58:49 He just keeps delivering the hits.
01:58:54 Someone put together an album.
01:58:55 Set that to a beat.
01:58:56 Yeah, help that boy out.
01:58:57 Yeah, please.
01:58:58 Do a remix.
01:58:59 Okay, great.
01:59:00 Let's move on.
01:59:01 Who Wants to Be a PCP Millionaire?
01:59:03 Here we go.
01:59:04 Another episode of everyone's favorite show.
01:59:07 Let's see how it goes this week.
01:59:08 Here we go.
01:59:09 Here we go again.
01:59:10 And go.
01:59:11 Welcome back to Who Wants to Be a PCP Millionaire?
01:59:15 Oh, so you're truly my man.
01:59:17 Last week left, Johnny, you pulled the PCP to see what they wanted from the voicemails.
01:59:24 How you got your answer yet?
01:59:25 Oh, yeah.
01:59:26 You bet you did, man.
01:59:27 I want to see the last voicemail.
01:59:28 Just got to give a last voicemail.
01:59:29 And I got to tell you, this answer is all kinds of right, like a fine woman.
01:59:37 Okay, Johnny.
01:59:38 Right.
01:59:39 The question is, what do the PCP want from the voicemails?
01:59:43 Is it, A, violent relationships, B, piano solos, C, interrogation, or D, ramblin'?
01:59:49 I'm going to go C, interrogation, violent answer.
01:59:52 Correct.
01:59:53 Next question.
01:59:54 Yeah, there you go.
01:59:55 What did Munchy request the real-ass Batman sing on the PCP?
01:59:59 Is it, A, the PCP theme song, B, one-two oatmeal, C, you guys suck your cocks, or D, the alphabet
02:00:07 song?
02:00:08 Oh baby.
02:00:09 I'm going to pay more attention than the voicemails.
02:00:12 I'm going to go with one, two, oatmeal, fight B, violent answer.
02:00:20 It's like, well, Johnny, you are...
02:00:25 Correct.
02:00:26 Yeah.
02:00:27 You know, real-ass Batman, I didn't know you could sing.
02:00:32 I can't, but Munchy, Munchy take, requested that I try.
02:00:35 Speaking of which, Nate, you would be so kind, please play the voicemail.
02:00:40 Next one.
02:00:41 Okay, ready, go.
02:00:42 Here we are.
02:00:43 One, two, three, go.
02:00:45 Perfect.
02:00:46 One, two, oatmeal, Kirby is a pink guy.
02:00:52 One, two, oatmeal, because Kirby's very cute.
02:00:57 Is this the real song?
02:00:59 Yep.
02:01:00 One, two, oatmeal, Kirby is a pink guy.
02:01:03 One, two, oatmeal, because Kirby's very cute.
02:01:09 Kirby inhales his enemies and makes it later.
02:01:13 Kirby's so happy there's something he can because he's such a pink guy.
02:01:18 He inhales his enemies and makes it later.
02:01:22 Kirby's so happy there's something he can because he's such a pink guy.
02:01:27 One, two, oatmeal, Kirby is a pink guy.
02:01:32 One, two, oatmeal, because Kirby's very cute.
02:01:38 One, two, oatmeal, Kirby is a pink guy.
02:01:43 One, two, oatmeal, because Kirby's very cute.
02:01:49 Here comes Kirby tonight to make it to protect because he's attacked by King Dedede.
02:01:57 Man, I swings his sword, King Dedede.
02:02:00 Here comes Kirby tonight to protect King Dedede.
02:02:07 Who protect King Dedede?
02:02:10 Man, I swings his sword.
02:02:11 How is this so fucking long?
02:02:13 Oh my God.
02:02:15 Oh my God.
02:02:18 Oh, he hit the time limit.
02:02:20 He hit the time limit.
02:02:21 It ended.
02:02:22 Finally.
02:02:23 What a triumph is now.
02:02:24 Literally what a triumph is that.
02:02:26 Wow.
02:02:27 A great one.
02:02:28 A great one.
02:02:29 I'll tell you that.
02:02:30 Yeah.
02:02:31 What a triumph is that?
02:02:32 A great one.
02:02:33 Thank you.
02:02:34 Everyone look at one, two, oatmeal.
02:02:36 Someone speed up, set that to the song.
02:02:38 I actually don't because you just listened to it just now.
02:02:41 That's all you need to know.
02:02:42 Yeah, that's how it sounds.
02:02:44 Okay, let's move on.
02:02:46 This is our last voicemail.
02:02:48 First, we've got Lost Tape Archive 5A.
02:02:53 Davoo?
02:02:54 Question mark?
02:02:56 Let's hear what we have.
02:02:58 Go.
02:02:59 I've been sitting on the shore for nearly two months.
02:03:03 Searching for answers.
02:03:05 Searching the ooze.
02:03:08 This smooths.
02:03:10 And for what?
02:03:12 I haven't found any tape.
02:03:14 All I got was this circular disc.
02:03:17 A CD, if you will.
02:03:20 What am I supposed to do with this?
02:03:22 I can't play a CD.
02:03:24 I don't have a Walkman.
02:03:26 But that's when it occurred to me.
02:03:28 This isn't just any old goo.
02:03:31 It's the goo.
02:03:34 Davoo.
02:03:35 I choose you.
02:03:42 I am the goo.
02:03:46 I will play this CD for you.
02:03:53 Holy shit, that worked.
02:03:55 Okay, part two. Here we go. Go.
02:04:03 It's Davoo. He's back.
02:04:06 I like to pretend that my girlfriend is a retard.
02:04:09 Because it makes me hang out with her whenever work permits.
02:04:13 I make out with her when she's taking a shit.
02:04:15 Oh no.
02:04:17 But my girlfriend is a child.
02:04:19 Makes my dad go wild.
02:04:21 They would leave you for me if they could.
02:04:23 To take a pic under my hood.
02:04:25 When I save peanut butter sandwich.
02:04:27 Do I put the image on the P?
02:04:29 Or on the E?
02:04:30 I sure hurt nobody notices.
02:04:32 But my insight into editing is beginning to tear baby shit.
02:04:35 I'm not as smart as you think I am.
02:04:37 My dick has two legs.
02:04:38 Two arms to clamp on your clam.
02:04:40 And stab my C-man on your womb.
02:04:42 Bixby, a bixby, a bixby.
02:04:47 Oh god.
02:04:55 Oh my god.
02:04:58 This is horrific.
02:05:05 Ben?
02:05:06 Munchy.
02:05:08 Executive decision?
02:05:10 Yeah.
02:05:11 Ban anyone from entering the Slime Sea with a CD.
02:05:14 Ban them.
02:05:15 Just outright ban them from ever doing it again.
02:05:17 They were a mistake.
02:05:18 We'll kill them on site.
02:05:20 If you're seen on the fair with a CD,
02:05:22 you will have to answer to us.
02:05:24 I've seen a lot of people playing a lot of Smash Bros. brawl
02:05:27 farming CDs in the subspace emissary.
02:05:29 And they're just piling up.
02:05:31 I think that was a war crime.
02:05:34 I've never heard such a savage takedown
02:05:37 of a poor sweet boy.
02:05:39 Poor Davoo.
02:05:41 Well, Davoo, even though he left the chat,
02:05:44 he's still with us in spirit.
02:05:46 God, I hope not.
02:05:48 I don't want him to hear these things.
02:05:51 Yeah, he should rest in peace.
02:05:53 Oh my god.
02:05:55 Well, Lost Tape Archive does his work again.
02:05:58 Thanks for unearthing that, Relic.
02:06:00 Classic.
02:06:01 Who has Lost Tape Archive done yet?
02:06:04 He's done a lot of us.
02:06:06 I think like half or most of us at this point,
02:06:09 not all of us yet,
02:06:11 someone should put that information together.
02:06:13 It should be like a playlist of some kind.
02:06:15 Because these are incredible.
02:06:17 Yeah, the audio editing is off the charts.
02:06:20 That beat was pretty fire.
02:06:22 That was pretty fire, I must say.
02:06:24 If Lost Tape Archive isn't already in the voice grail,
02:06:27 I think he deserves to be there.
02:06:29 Just for the sheer effort he's putting in there.
02:06:31 He deserves to be there for his past crimes.
02:06:34 So this crime, he's putting straight into voice jail.
02:06:37 What do you think?
02:06:38 Can he exist in a superposition of jail and...
02:06:42 Voice Azkaban.
02:06:44 Yeah, I think he exists in both simultaneously.
02:06:47 Torn between two worlds.
02:06:49 Voice Limbo.
02:06:50 Okay, so it shall be.
02:06:52 He exists in both simultaneously,
02:06:54 like Schrodinger's Cat or whatever the deal is.
02:06:57 There you go.
02:06:58 Schrodinger's Cat Clues.
02:06:59 Click on the link in the description to watch Gay for a Day.
02:07:02 On our bandcamp, it's in high quality.
02:07:04 High quality rips way better than the live version.
02:07:06 The highest of quality.
02:07:08 It could not have been more high quality.
02:07:10 Let me just say about Gay for a Day.
02:07:12 By the way, that had seven tracks, right?
02:07:14 I didn't miss it.
02:07:15 Seven tracks, and I believe four bonus tracks
02:07:18 that you get if you download it.
02:07:20 They're not connected to the story.
02:07:22 They are their own standalone songs.
02:07:24 Oh, okay, I didn't listen to those.
02:07:26 By the way, I listened to Gay for a Day,
02:07:28 and I just want to say I loved it.
02:07:30 There were only a couple of times I skipped ahead.
02:07:32 I just, as someone who's on the record,
02:07:34 pushing hard for Gay for a Day to be real,
02:07:36 I'm glad that you finally delivered.
02:07:38 I'm glad that my faith in the project's completion
02:07:40 was not in vain.
02:07:42 Indeed.
02:07:44 Tom was the carrot, and I was the stick
02:07:46 lashing from behind, or the opposite of that.
02:07:48 I don't know, whatever it is.
02:07:50 It exists. Go listen to it.
02:07:52 It is a jolly good time.
02:07:54 I had a great time listening to it.
02:07:56 And now,
02:07:58 if you come in
02:08:00 and give your covers a Gay for a Day song,
02:08:02 we will, of course, play on the voicemails
02:08:04 every single time.
02:08:06 Every single time.
02:08:08 Let's put a quality floor on that real quick
02:08:10 before we...
02:08:12 Munchie and Gibbs said that someone in their band
02:08:14 said that they wanted to do a cover of the album.
02:08:16 God, I hope you stick to it, you coward,
02:08:18 and actually deliver that.
02:08:20 I want to hear it.
02:08:22 Heavy metal covers.
02:08:24 It could use a little bit.
02:08:26 I'll, for keeping the quality of the original,
02:08:28 you know, I hate remakes,
02:08:30 but a reimagining is something else
02:08:32 that I could get behind, you know.
02:08:34 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:08:36 Like on the link in the description
02:08:38 to listen to Grimp, too,
02:08:40 should we discuss politics.
02:08:42 And speaking of not
02:08:44 discussing politics, Nate,
02:08:46 I don't want to talk about this right now,
02:08:48 but I think you should watch...
02:08:50 You ever watch ContraPoints?
02:08:52 I've seen ContraPoints a few times, yeah.
02:08:54 ContraPoints' newest video is called
02:08:56 TransTrenders,
02:08:58 and I would recommend you give it a watch
02:09:00 for some things...
02:09:02 Based on our previous discussion in this very episode.
02:09:04 Yes, for some...
02:09:06 things to mull over and chew on.
02:09:08 Look, my only point will be
02:09:10 that I've got no problem, trans people exist.
02:09:12 They seem perfectly real to me, got no issue.
02:09:14 Shut up, I don't care.
02:09:16 But Chris Chan is a different case.
02:09:18 He's not, but anyway.
02:09:20 She's not, fuck!
02:09:22 No! It's spreading.
02:09:24 Alright, anyway.
02:09:26 Watch TransTrenders, it's good.
02:09:28 I'll consider it.
02:09:30 Hey guys, Nate from The Future here.
02:09:32 Listen, I would never do anything like
02:09:34 misgender someone to their face
02:09:36 when they so clearly want to be addressed
02:09:38 in a certain way. That's not my bag.
02:09:40 And of course, this extends to Chris as well.
02:09:42 But this is a comedy discussion
02:09:44 podcast, and we're just
02:09:46 here to discuss ideas,
02:09:48 and I don't think gender or anything else
02:09:50 is a sacred cow.
02:09:52 I don't think it's crazy to have certain
02:09:54 thoughts that some people may be more
02:09:56 or less sincere. We know that
02:09:58 TransTrenders exist to some degree.
02:10:00 Some degree.
02:10:02 And to maybe think about some people that
02:10:04 perhaps they could be in that category,
02:10:06 I don't think is unreasonable.
02:10:08 And I think most people would agree with that point.
02:10:10 But I'm never going to be rude to someone in real life
02:10:12 when they want to be referred to in a certain way.
02:10:14 So I just wanted to make that perfectly clear.
02:10:16 Okay, I think we're all on the same page.
02:10:18 After finishing this conversation,
02:10:20 I actually did go and watch
02:10:22 part of that ContraPoints video.
02:10:24 Her videos are not my favorite stylistically,
02:10:26 but I do think I got the general
02:10:28 thesis out of it that she was trying to convey,
02:10:30 which seemed to be an argument of,
02:10:32 as opposed to arguing about who's male,
02:10:34 who's female, you know, whatever position on the spectrum, whatever,
02:10:36 instead, why not put empathy
02:10:38 and compassion for how people
02:10:40 may feel or identify over
02:10:42 any kind of logical proof or categorization
02:10:44 as to gender? Because is it even that
02:10:46 important? To which I say
02:10:48 that's not a crazy argument
02:10:50 and I can see where people are coming from
02:10:52 to make those kind of points. So does Chris's
02:10:54 gender really matter? Is it my
02:10:56 business to even judge? No,
02:10:58 not really. My only rebuttal to that would be
02:11:00 that, firstly, I do think that gender
02:11:02 has some real use in the real world,
02:11:04 so I don't think it's useful to just throw it
02:11:06 out as a total concept right now.
02:11:08 But also, there's guys like me
02:11:10 and I think a lot of people in a similar position
02:11:12 who are just very
02:11:14 hearingly minded, I guess I'd say,
02:11:16 where we try to categorize things
02:11:18 and put them into boxes and whatnot, and I would
02:11:20 just ask people to have patience
02:11:22 with those of us who don't necessarily put
02:11:24 empathy as our prime, overarching,
02:11:26 most important ideal,
02:11:28 but naturally do think in this kind of
02:11:30 organizing way. I don't think it's
02:11:32 evil or bad, it's just a different
02:11:34 way of approaching the world. Because I think
02:11:36 we all know it is not my prime
02:11:38 virtue. I'm more of a problem
02:11:40 solver. Anyway, thanks for listening,
02:11:42 and I'll talk to you later.
02:12:12 We can use to determine who is or is not
02:12:14 really trans, who does or does not
02:12:16 meet the criteria to be
02:12:18 referred to as the gender of their choosing.
02:12:20 Gender is not as
02:12:22 simple as a question of XX
02:12:24 versus XY, this kind of scientific
02:12:26 interrogation will not yield
02:12:28 us a robust definition
02:12:30 of what is male and what is female.
02:12:32 Therefore, there is no objective
02:12:34 metric that we can use to determine
02:12:36 who does and does not
02:12:38 get to decide their own gender identity.
02:12:40 We must accept that everybody gets to
02:12:42 do that. It's the only logically
02:12:44 consistent position. And accepting
02:12:46 some people's ability to do that while denying
02:12:48 others or doing it sometimes
02:12:50 only in public and only not
02:12:52 in private or whatever solves no
02:12:54 problems and accomplishes nothing.
02:12:56 So in the case where someone
02:12:58 has made it abundantly clear what
02:13:00 their preferred gender is as
02:13:02 Christine has, I think the only thing
02:13:04 to do is to accept what
02:13:06 they wish to be referred to.
02:13:08 And I'm committed to doing that for Christine
02:13:10 and I'm committed to doing that for
02:13:12 everyone. For a question
02:13:14 that has no rigorous logical answer
02:13:16 I think that empathy is the only
02:13:18 thing that we can fall back on
02:13:20 to answer it. Thank you and
02:13:22 get fucked.
02:13:24 Oh hey by the way, right now
02:13:26 after this episode I'm going to be speaking to music
02:13:28 I'm going to be recording a live concert
02:13:30 in Uzgarans. It will have been a week ago
02:13:32 by the time you hear it. But just go back
02:13:34 and I think there will probably be a stream on RFCK
02:13:36 literally a
02:13:38 real live concert with all the
02:13:40 RFCK musicians playing in a voice call
02:13:42 in RFCK an in-game concert
02:13:44 it will have happened. Good job. Fantastic
02:13:46 how exciting.
02:13:48 Is that right after this? Yes. We're recording
02:13:50 okay I'll hop over. Sick.
02:13:52 Alright I guess we're done then.
02:13:54 patreon.com slash the procrastiners people
02:13:56 one dollar get in the
02:13:58 discord five dollars get the bonus episodes
02:14:00 there's like 27 28
02:14:02 I stole water and it's only
02:14:04 one dollar. Dude are we
02:14:06 going to hear that? Is that like in a month?
02:14:08 Yeah no. Oh my god you're right
02:14:10 I forgot about that.
02:14:12 Oh how exciting we got out we got out
02:14:14 that boy. Can you believe they didn't give us a fucking panel
02:14:16 can you believe that? You know what I very much
02:14:18 can believe that because we are not
02:14:20 brony people at all we have no credentials
02:14:22 been out for years
02:14:24 I very much can believe it.
02:14:26 I can't believe this. I'm just going to flex my privilege
02:14:28 here because I'm friends with Saber Sparky got me on
02:14:30 a panel on a free badge so
02:14:32 Saber Sparky is also not a pony
02:14:34 man nor has he been for years so what's
02:14:36 his credentials? Yeah exactly
02:14:38 Nate do you understand there's given that
02:14:40 to anyone who asks. I mean
02:14:42 everybody in that clique does have a panel
02:14:44 despite not being mostly pony people
02:14:46 at all anymore.
02:14:48 Damn. I mean they were like
02:14:50 much bigger than we were at the time
02:14:52 Saber Spark is big
02:14:54 Saber Spark is the
02:14:56 Saber Spark is the worst
02:14:58 He has 800,000 subs
02:15:00 Saber Spark is the worst lowest common denominator
02:15:02 content most toxic shit
02:15:04 I've ever seen on YouTube. Saber Spark?
02:15:06 Yeah his videos are the worst
02:15:08 I mean I never really watched the live but
02:15:10 I hate them. He just rips on shitty fucking
02:15:12 animated videos
02:15:14 They're very milk toast
02:15:16 like unique nemesaurus
02:15:18 tier. Well I think they're worse
02:15:20 than that. They're normie content
02:15:22 but they're not bad normie content
02:15:24 I think they are bad normie content
02:15:26 The voice over is
02:15:28 hilarious
02:15:30 There you go there's some feedback for you
02:15:32 Don't tell him I said that though
02:15:34 You can tell him yourself when you see him in
02:15:36 BronyCon. It's a secret
02:15:38 I can't wait for the
02:15:40 brony brawl while everybody kills each other
02:15:42 Oh won't that be fun. That's the last day
02:15:44 that's Sunday night. It all ends
02:15:46 Because there's no bronycon anymore
02:15:48 we have to die. What's the point
02:15:50 of even being alive?
02:15:52 You're right. You're right
02:15:54 At TP Crasneers on Twitter
02:15:56 Check it out people
02:15:58 And that's gonna do it. Don't forget to give us your money, Patreon
