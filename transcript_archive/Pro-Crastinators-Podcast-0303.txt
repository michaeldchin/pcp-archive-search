00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:04 Son of a bitch, son of a bitch, son of a bitch, son of a bitch, son of a bitch.
00:00:13 Okay welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast I guess we're going, I guess we're live, I
00:00:19 guess we're not live, this is pre-recorded.
00:00:22 The pre-recorded Colin show, there was a bit, you know, there was a bit on the, you know,
00:00:28 There was a bit on Mr. Show called The Pre-Recorded Colin Show, which was about, it was David
00:00:36 Cross was the host of a show and like, just the whole show was just confusion over like
00:00:42 people calling in and leaving effectively voicemails thinking that the show was live.
00:00:49 And so it's just a big like, people thinking they're talking live but he's responding
00:00:54 to them and it's just a series of responding to voicemails that like have not understood
00:01:00 the nature of the show and that's pretty much our voicemail segment.
00:01:05 So you know, I feel like that was ahead of its time.
00:01:08 That sounds pretty good.
00:01:11 I like Mr. Show.
00:01:13 Well it had its moments.
00:01:15 It's actually kind of, a lot of it sucks in hindsight.
00:01:17 But that's comedy.
00:01:19 That's comedy.
00:01:21 I'm here Ben St. Gibbentake and Cheesy Manfredo is back.
00:01:25 Hey, I'm back.
00:01:27 With a vengeance.
00:01:28 Oh, I'm like, I'm feeling an acute sense of like tiredness that like makes me want to
00:01:35 sneeze.
00:01:36 Like I woke, like I just got out of bed and like I want to be back in bed and that makes
00:01:42 my face feel like pinched up like I'm gonna, like I'm gonna sneeze, like my eyes are stinging.
00:01:48 You just got out of bed?
00:01:50 Yeah.
00:01:51 That's so interesting because I just got out of bed too right now.
00:01:54 Oh my God, we were in bed together.
00:01:56 We were in bed together.
00:01:58 We were homosexual.
00:01:59 Were you here to hear first folks?
00:02:02 We was homosexual.
00:02:04 Okay.
00:02:05 Yeah.
00:02:06 Okay.
00:02:07 So how was it with me?
00:02:14 What the gay sex we do?
00:02:16 Yes.
00:02:17 Yeah.
00:02:18 It was pretty all right.
00:02:20 The problem was that your dick was just too massive for me.
00:02:23 Uh-oh.
00:02:24 It didn't fit in my mouth.
00:02:25 It didn't fit in my mouth.
00:02:26 It was gonna say the same thing about you.
00:02:29 So neither of you could do anything.
00:02:31 We were, yeah, we couldn't.
00:02:33 Yeah, we couldn't.
00:02:34 Our dicks were so big we couldn't have gay sex.
00:02:36 So it's like, damn, I guess we got to go back to fucking women in the bud.
00:02:41 Like God intended.
00:02:43 Isn't there a show, I think Michelle tweeted something.
00:02:48 Were they fucking women in the bud?
00:02:50 No.
00:02:51 Ew.
00:02:52 No.
00:02:53 There's a show that's called My Husband's Too Big or My Husband Won't Fit.
00:02:59 Is that real?
00:03:00 I think, yeah.
00:03:01 Is that TLC?
00:03:02 I think it's Chinese.
00:03:04 There's like a Netflix show that's called My Husband Won't Fit.
00:03:06 Maybe it's Korean.
00:03:07 There's a, like, My Husband Won't Fit.
00:03:10 This sounds right up my alley.
00:03:12 And I haven't watched it, but I highly recommend it to anyone.
00:03:19 Won't, not a waste of your time.
00:03:21 I promise.
00:03:26 Kimiko and Kenichi meeting college, build a happy marriage together, but over time an
00:03:30 unusual problem fended to the server relationship.
00:03:33 Oh, it's a drama.
00:03:35 Give.
00:03:36 Save us.
00:03:37 Yes.
00:03:38 My big announcement that even if you already know that my secret project was revealed to
00:03:44 be Pumpkin Alley, the fucking video game I'm making, wow.
00:03:50 I knew about it.
00:03:51 I knew about it.
00:03:53 I knew about it because I am a patron at patreon.com slash give and take also probably because
00:04:00 we're on the show together, but both, both reasons.
00:04:07 When did you first start talking about the secret project?
00:04:10 Give.
00:04:11 Do you remember?
00:04:12 Because it feels like forever.
00:04:13 It has been a while.
00:04:14 You've been working on it for a year, but I don't remember when you started, like, talking
00:04:17 about it.
00:04:18 I don't remember when I started talking about it.
00:04:22 Maybe it was initially, well, the project started in January 2021, and I was like, it's
00:04:28 time to start, like, making a video game.
00:04:33 And I was like, that's what I'm going to do this year.
00:04:36 And like the initial idea was to make some sort of demo by the end of the year.
00:04:40 Or well, I think that became the goal because I didn't know how long anything would take.
00:04:46 And it seemed like it was possible.
00:04:47 It wasn't quite possible, but then early this year, it was finally ready to be revealed.
00:04:52 So it's been, yeah, literally a year and a month or two since I started working on it.
00:05:01 There was a bunch of months in the middle of last year where I was sick and unable to
00:05:05 work.
00:05:06 We're both game devs now.
00:05:10 That's true.
00:05:11 We're all game dev people.
00:05:14 I guess this isn't Digi's anime podcast anymore.
00:05:17 This is Digi's podcast.
00:05:19 This is now video.
00:05:22 I was trying to call you Gibb and take, but I pronounced it video game.
00:05:28 That's my new name.
00:05:30 I'm changing my name.
00:05:32 To give and take is now a dead name.
00:05:34 I'm called video game now.
00:05:35 That's my new name.
00:05:37 No, it's still spelled Gibb and take, but the G is pronounced as a V and the B is pronounced
00:05:43 as a D and etc.
00:05:44 And the T is pronounced as a G and so on in that order.
00:05:49 We're Gibb and takes video game podcast now.
00:05:52 Yes.
00:05:53 You heard of Neo pronouns.
00:05:56 Here are Neo dead names.
00:05:58 My pronouns are video slash gay.
00:06:01 Yes.
00:06:02 Yes.
00:06:03 So, yeah, if you have not heard and this is your first time, go to link in the description
00:06:09 pumpkinali on itch.io.
00:06:11 Free demo.
00:06:12 Right.
00:06:13 Link in the description.
00:06:14 It's a free demo to play.
00:06:15 I would like everyone to play it in the world.
00:06:17 I don't think I'm going to do that later today.
00:06:21 I have a question at the top of my mind, seeing the trailer for a pumpkin alley.
00:06:28 Do I have to have red bell jade to get this game?
00:06:31 No, this, this is the, the origin story of the friendship between punk and alley.
00:06:38 They are two characters, they meet each other.
00:06:40 That's the story of the game that I have roughly lined out.
00:06:44 Right.
00:06:45 Right.
00:06:46 Right.
00:06:47 So, so it's a, it's a prequel.
00:06:48 Right.
00:06:49 It's a prequel.
00:06:50 I saw you.
00:06:51 I posted a drawing of a Tiki on Twitter.
00:06:56 Is Tiki going to be in the game?
00:06:58 No, probably not.
00:06:59 No, because they need Tiki and bell jade.
00:07:01 So, no, I wouldn't make any sense.
00:07:02 I just felt like drawing her because it's been a while.
00:07:06 Yeah.
00:07:07 Yeah.
00:07:08 The, the, the adventure of punk going out into the world, finding alley-oop and becoming
00:07:15 friends on an adventure.
00:07:16 I have it.
00:07:17 Details to be determined and also I don't want to spoil anything.
00:07:20 Well, okay.
00:07:21 Yeah.
00:07:22 I mean, don't...
00:07:23 About the story at least.
00:07:24 I could talk about some things.
00:07:25 Don't answer if it's spoilers, but what's up with fairy bits?
00:07:29 Why fairy, why are they fairy bits?
00:07:31 Because that's, that's what you collect in the, in the game, by the way.
00:07:34 Yeah, it's kind of gay.
00:07:35 It's kind of...
00:07:36 Yeah.
00:07:37 What?
00:07:38 Why, why gay though?
00:07:39 Well, it's an allegory.
00:07:42 You see, they're gay.
00:07:44 Fascinating.
00:07:45 No, it's initially the, the, when I was writing up like the, the story and the, I was thinking
00:07:51 of the locations, the enemies, what you do physically and then also the story that carries
00:07:56 you through.
00:07:57 Initially, I wasn't sure about what collectibles there would be and we decided fairy bits.
00:08:03 So there is lore, but I'm not sure how it fits into the lore I already had planned for
00:08:10 like the enemies.
00:08:11 Very...
00:08:12 There's lore for that.
00:08:14 Okay.
00:08:15 Now tell me, tell me if I'm completely off base.
00:08:17 I was, I strongly, I got the feeling that pumps, pumps health bar looks like fairy
00:08:23 bits and I, and I was so much that like when I took damage, I thought collecting fairy
00:08:28 bits was going to restore her health.
00:08:30 It didn't.
00:08:31 I don't know.
00:08:32 Are those, are those connected?
00:08:34 Is there a reason?
00:08:35 Is that bad game?
00:08:36 Is that bad game design?
00:08:37 It is, it's definitely bad game design.
00:08:38 Definitely.
00:08:39 Bad games.
00:08:40 Well, the thing with the demo, right?
00:08:41 Yeah.
00:08:42 Everything could change when the final game is released.
00:08:45 Yeah.
00:08:46 So if, like, there was no particular reason they're the same color, it was just sort of
00:08:49 like, that's a cool color.
00:08:50 I'm a lore guy.
00:08:51 Like that for her health.
00:08:52 I'm a lore guy.
00:08:53 I'm always looking for lore connections.
00:08:54 When it comes to like the actual thing, lore connections will be considered with every
00:08:58 design element.
00:08:59 Yeah.
00:09:00 Yeah.
00:09:01 We just sort of like, initially the, we were like, I wasn't sure how fast things could
00:09:06 be done, but my brother, Charlie, he's a programmer.
00:09:09 He went to Game Dev University School.
00:09:13 He went to Gaming High School.
00:09:14 He went to Gaming High School, became a big gamer.
00:09:17 Lucky.
00:09:19 And he's just sort of always interested in programming things, so he's very good at
00:09:23 that.
00:09:24 And so like the first month of working on it, we got quite a lot like of the assets and
00:09:29 stuff working.
00:09:32 Things that took a long time were like the camera and movement and a bit of the animation.
00:09:37 The fairy bits were like one of the first things he made.
00:09:40 Just like, I'll make this little code.
00:09:43 So when you go near them, they jump up and then swoop around to you.
00:09:46 And it's like, it's really nice looking.
00:09:48 Yeah.
00:09:49 So there wasn't much design into like, like from my end, like what they're supposed to
00:09:55 look like yet.
00:09:58 So you know, who knows.
00:10:01 That's pretty epic.
00:10:03 You just made them look.
00:10:06 You did, well, he did some art and you did, but you did like most of the art.
00:10:13 I think the credits list him as doing like textures.
00:10:17 Shelley makes most of the models and things like the trees and like the floor, like cubes
00:10:23 that you can like copy paste and make different shapes with.
00:10:26 Yeah.
00:10:27 He drew the textures for that while he was muddling them because it was easier than me
00:10:31 like getting a UV map sent to me and then painting something on.
00:10:36 Yeah.
00:10:37 So so those and they're pretty good.
00:10:41 And I did like the textures for the bush and the flame particle things and the health bar.
00:10:48 And I mean, you can tell, I think, well, things that I've drawn.
00:10:53 Yeah.
00:10:53 And then I animated punk with my 3D animation knowledge.
00:10:58 So this is a demo, right?
00:11:00 And this is like how long is this demo?
00:11:02 It took me it took me maybe an hour to like it took me less than an hour to like
00:11:09 basically explore the whole thing.
00:11:11 But then it took me like another hour to find all 250 fairy bits.
00:11:17 How long do you imagine the full game to begin?
00:11:21 I'm hoping it'll be like.
00:11:24 Because you can't like aim so high that you need like a 10 years or like to hire a whole studio.
00:11:33 I don't really prepare to do all that stuff.
00:11:35 So it's going to be like a sort of small ish game, maybe five hours.
00:11:41 That's not small for an indie game.
00:11:42 Like for the sort of game you want, that's like pretty good, I think.
00:11:47 OK, when is the animated series going to come out?
00:11:51 That's what I'm wondering where the real money is at.
00:11:54 Moichan dicing.
00:11:56 Well, Chen dies.
00:11:58 Well, I mean, when can I go into a when can I go into a hot topic
00:12:03 and buy my own punk marriage?
00:12:07 That's what I'm wondering.
00:12:08 Well, actually, I was I forgot I had notes.
00:12:10 I had some I had I had a couple of notes to complain for the for the devs.
00:12:16 I said, like, hey, I got so I got a bone to pick with whoever designed this piece of shit.
00:12:20 Oh, yeah, I. All right.
00:12:24 So I gave I was first complaint.
00:12:27 There's no gay sex.
00:12:29 Where is all the gay sex?
00:12:30 Give OK, it's family friendly.
00:12:31 Obviously, I can't do that.
00:12:33 I can't do that. Such a such a product.
00:12:35 OK, well, I guess I won't be playing it.
00:12:38 I guess I won't be playing it then.
00:12:39 I'm not it. You can figure it out.
00:12:42 It's violence. It's violence against me.
00:12:45 All right. Yeah.
00:12:46 I I missed I'm I guess at some point in this,
00:12:52 I will probably have to say like what the places were that I found stuff.
00:12:56 So if you don't want to like if you want to find everything in the game,
00:12:59 I guess don't don't listen to play.
00:13:00 Play the game right now.
00:13:02 It is a unsubscribe from the PCP.
00:13:04 Go play the game.
00:13:05 The game is very easy and fun and good.
00:13:08 And there's a few little glitches.
00:13:09 But yeah, the main glitch that I found was well, actually,
00:13:15 it was it was when I was fucking around.
00:13:17 I spent a lot of time after I got to basically the end.
00:13:22 And OK, OK, here was here was my play experience.
00:13:25 I progressed more or less.
00:13:28 OK, I kind of was just like went past the big area
00:13:32 with the big like hollow tree with the mushroom stairs.
00:13:36 That's sort of like one of the main areas.
00:13:38 But I kind of just like accidentally like missed it and kind of went by it.
00:13:43 And I sort of progressed directly to what I guess would be the last area,
00:13:47 the area with like the angry mushroom that throws mushrooms at you.
00:13:53 And I got there and then I collected all the fairy bits.
00:13:58 And I was like, OK, there's definitely I definitely missed an area.
00:14:02 But while I'm here, I saw up on the cliff, there's a doorway.
00:14:08 You know what I'm talking about?
00:14:09 Like up high, there's like an alley grotto doorway.
00:14:13 Yes, little caves that you can go into.
00:14:16 And I was like, oh, hmm, how do we get up there?
00:14:19 And maybe and maybe this is on me.
00:14:21 But I spent I spent a not inconsiderable amount of time
00:14:26 trying to find ways to jump up the sides of the mountain
00:14:31 to jump around on the up like
00:14:34 mountaintops sort of ringing around the area in order to jump up
00:14:39 and get up to that like high up door zone.
00:14:43 And I did it. I did it.
00:14:46 The main glitch that I found in the game was when I was jumping around
00:14:49 in areas when I wasn't supposed to be, I would slide down
00:14:54 certain parts of the mountain and I would be caught in the geometry.
00:14:58 Yeah, sort of in between two slopes where I would just be falling forever.
00:15:02 And I would have to use the restart command.
00:15:06 Yeah, it's it's funny.
00:15:07 There's lots of people who have jumped around on on like
00:15:12 not technically out of bounds.
00:15:14 Like I've never liked games that have invisible walls.
00:15:18 But because of that, I think because of the lack of invisible walls,
00:15:21 people thought you should go to places that you shouldn't.
00:15:26 And.
00:15:28 When it comes to like the slipping down.
00:15:32 It's it's determined we're going to redo a lot of things like that.
00:15:38 Because like from the ground up, they're just sort of fundamentally
00:15:42 not not good.
00:15:45 But like it you land and then it checks the angle of the polygon
00:15:52 you're standing on.
00:15:53 And if it's certainly if it's a certain height, you know, slip.
00:15:56 But there's like a little grace period where you can sort of jump
00:15:59 because some some other thing was interacting with that.
00:16:02 And we needed it to jump sometimes it's a bit messy.
00:16:05 So, uh, mm-hmm, there's work to do in like understanding level design
00:16:11 to like make it clear to the player where you should be going
00:16:15 and where is no go please.
00:16:19 And also just making it harder to do it.
00:16:22 I yeah, I was able to get up on the side mountains and jump around.
00:16:28 And I actually got up to before I even found
00:16:32 well, it turned out I wasn't really supposed to go up there
00:16:35 because I got up to that higher up doorway
00:16:39 and you can't actually go into it.
00:16:41 And I was like darn.
00:16:43 But then I was like, well, that's kind of on me
00:16:45 because I hadn't collected all the bits yet.
00:16:47 I shouldn't be trying to get up to like secret areas.
00:16:50 So I went back and I collected the other bits
00:16:52 and then I came and I explore the area some more.
00:16:54 And I found down below there's the actual entrance
00:16:57 where you're supposed to go in and then there's bits in there.
00:17:01 And then you go through it and there's the exit
00:17:03 and you come out, you come out that upper door
00:17:07 and then you you drop down and Pump is waiting there for you.
00:17:11 So I was like, OK, got it.
00:17:13 And then, yeah, I went back and I explored and I had
00:17:16 and I had all but 12 fairy bits.
00:17:18 I had 238 fairy bits and I'm like, there's 12 left.
00:17:22 And I went back to all the previous areas
00:17:26 and I and I roamed around and I was like, damn it, I can't find them.
00:17:30 I'm sure there's there's a I was sure
00:17:34 that I was looking for an an alley cave, a grotto, I called them.
00:17:40 So I'm jumping around and I'm looking and I'm looking for caves
00:17:44 and I can't find any.
00:17:45 And the way that I ended up finding it was I was jumping around up.
00:17:50 I was I was again, I was like, I can't find anything here.
00:17:53 Maybe if I get if I get a higher vantage point.
00:17:55 So I was jumping around on mountains
00:17:57 that I definitely wasn't supposed to be on.
00:17:59 And just by happenstance through from above,
00:18:03 near the starting area, I saw a little crack in between like the rocks.
00:18:08 I saw the glimpse after like an hour.
00:18:11 I saw the glimpse of a fairy bit and I jumped down
00:18:14 and I fell down into a little not a not an alley grotto,
00:18:18 but a little side cave.
00:18:20 And I realized there was like in the beginning area, there's a little
00:18:24 sort of like a little crack in the rock that you can go through to a little
00:18:27 a little secret area that has some cool like unique flowers and stuff in them.
00:18:31 And I was like, got it.
00:18:32 So so I had missed that on my first go
00:18:34 and I found it sort of in the wrong way by jumping around,
00:18:38 jumping around on rocks.
00:18:41 But that was fun.
00:18:43 It worked. It worked out what you're saying.
00:18:45 So what you're saying is this game was built wrong.
00:18:47 I would say it's built different.
00:18:49 It's just built different. That's all different.
00:18:53 Not wrong. Not wrong. Just different.
00:18:56 But while I was hunting those last 12 bits, I found
00:18:59 what I call the surprise lizards because I found I found four of them.
00:19:03 And I know there's a fifth one that I didn't find.
00:19:06 Steel Viper on Twitter posted there's a red lizard that I didn't find.
00:19:09 But I found a green one, yellow and blue and purple one.
00:19:13 I found four of five, maybe more of these lizards that when you take their picture,
00:19:18 they make a little they make what sounds to me like the little metal gear
00:19:23 alert sound. Oh, yeah.
00:19:27 That's why that's what it sounded like.
00:19:29 And I was OK. Oh, they're like surprised.
00:19:31 It's like a startle. It's a surprise lizard, a surprised lizard,
00:19:35 surprise lizard, a video, a video game reference in my video game.
00:19:39 No, no way.
00:19:41 It wasn't a reference, I guess it's just a coincidence.
00:19:45 Yeah, as a reference.
00:19:47 I think it's a reference.
00:19:48 I'm going to put that down as an Easter egg.
00:19:50 Yeah. Put that down in the week.
00:19:52 Yeah, the week is going to be like, you know,
00:19:54 these lizards sound is taken from metal gear solid.
00:19:58 The first the first one was, I think,
00:20:00 the the yellow one who's on the back of a rock.
00:20:04 And I was like, oh, that's neat.
00:20:05 Many people found that one.
00:20:06 Yeah, I was like, oh, that's neat.
00:20:07 And I took a picture and it made a little boing sound.
00:20:10 And I was like, oh, oh, oh, now we're cooking.
00:20:13 All right. Yeah.
00:20:15 How many are there? I got it.
00:20:16 I got to know how many there are.
00:20:17 Tell us all the tips and tricks for us.
00:20:20 I actually, I actually forget.
00:20:22 I think there's six.
00:20:24 Shit. Shit.
00:20:27 They're secret lizards.
00:20:29 You should make.
00:20:30 Collect them all.
00:20:31 It's been fun seeing, seeing how, like,
00:20:33 people have varying levels of, like.
00:20:38 Like varying degrees of finding the secrets.
00:20:42 People who find the one lizard, usually the one behind the rock,
00:20:45 they're like, oh, I found the lizard.
00:20:47 Yeah.
00:20:47 And they don't know those other ones.
00:20:50 I think the second one I saw was in the per,
00:20:55 because there's, I think there's three
00:20:56 alley grottos and in the one that's purple, I remembered,
00:21:00 I think I remembered when I found that yellow one,
00:21:04 I remembered that I had, I was looking everywhere
00:21:09 for, I was looking everywhere for the last 12 bits.
00:21:12 And I went back into the alley grotto that's all purple
00:21:15 and I remembered, wait a minute,
00:21:16 I think I remember seeing something on the ceiling here
00:21:20 and I looked up and sure enough was like, yes, I was right.
00:21:23 There is another lizard up on the ceiling.
00:21:26 And I took another picture of it and it made the sound.
00:21:29 I was like, yes.
00:21:30 My exploration has been rewarded.
00:21:34 Intrinsically rewarded.
00:21:37 I mean, it didn't, didn't give me anything, but that's OK.
00:21:39 It was the joy of discovery.
00:21:40 Yes.
00:21:42 Yeah.
00:21:43 I mean, the biggest problem is that no Xbox achievement
00:21:49 was awarded for finding each lizard.
00:21:52 That's my big complaint, too.
00:21:53 The little achievements don't show up.
00:21:56 You haven't even played it.
00:21:57 I'm playing it right now.
00:21:58 What are you talking about?
00:21:59 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:01 I'm playing it right now.
00:22:02 You're not playing it.
00:22:04 Oh, no, I'll play it, I'll play it.
00:22:06 Just like I'll eventually play the booze game
00:22:08 and just like eventually I'll play Ben's game, you know,
00:22:10 it's going to eventually happen.
00:22:12 Well, unlike unlike the booze game and Ben's game,
00:22:15 my game is in three dimensions.
00:22:17 That's a little too much from my eyes.
00:22:20 I can't play anything.
00:22:21 Yeah, I already live in a three dimensional world.
00:22:24 Why don't I look into another three dimensional world?
00:22:26 It's it's too much effort, really, you ask me.
00:22:30 Fortunately, fortunately, Phantom's Revenge.
00:22:33 The Phantom's Revenge is is is better.
00:22:36 It might lack the third dimension, but it's it's not a demo.
00:22:39 It's a finish. It's it's it's it.
00:22:41 There's no no more potential.
00:22:43 There's no more nothing else to summon.
00:22:46 You've you've completely wrung it dry.
00:22:48 I have wrung it dry.
00:22:49 It's actually it's very frustrating.
00:22:51 I'm very frustrating because you beat me as I
00:22:54 as it has been looking increasingly likely that you were going to.
00:22:57 And it makes me really mad because Phantom's Revenge is done.
00:23:00 It has been done for weeks, maybe more than a month now.
00:23:03 And I'm just and I'm just drawing panels.
00:23:06 This week I am drawing just last night I was drawing.
00:23:10 I'm drawing the final scene, not not not the end scene, not the ending,
00:23:14 but the the final scene of Simon punishment that I had envisioned in my head.
00:23:18 I'm drawing that and it feels weird to finally be drawing it after I imagined it for so long.
00:23:25 But I'm drawing that.
00:23:26 And so I'm like, I just
00:23:29 I'm so close to being able to post it, but I can't post it.
00:23:32 I can't post it until it's all done.
00:23:35 How does it feel getting feel like your wife?
00:23:39 All the video game play as gay sex.
00:23:41 I'll tell you that much.
00:23:42 They'll never play another video game.
00:23:45 Elden Rings out.
00:23:47 You beat Elden Ring.
00:23:48 Oh, my God.
00:23:49 And now I'm going to be behind Elden Ring.
00:23:51 And now everybody's talking about Elden Ring.
00:23:53 You'll play you'll play you'll beat Elden Ring in a day.
00:23:57 Didn't it just come out?
00:24:00 No, I made Elden Ring.
00:24:01 Yeah, that's that's an alley was the demo for Elden.
00:24:04 That's a lie, maybe.
00:24:05 That's maybe a lie.
00:24:07 I don't know.
00:24:08 I don't I don't play.
00:24:08 I never Elden Elden Ring.
00:24:11 I haven't even played Demon Souls.
00:24:13 I can't I can't really play that one.
00:24:15 I can't jump right into the franchise.
00:24:18 Elden Ring looks pretty cool, I guess it looks.
00:24:22 I never played I never played Breath of the Wild, but I really do.
00:24:26 I think that the whole open world, the way that Breath of the Wild
00:24:29 does the open world stuff is pretty neat.
00:24:31 And I think it's probably cool because I've heard that the Elden Ring
00:24:35 is like Dark Souls, but in a Breath of the Wild open world.
00:24:37 Which is pretty cool, cool idea there, which is so funny because I thought
00:24:42 Breath of the Wild was like the Dark Soul of Legend of Zelda.
00:24:48 I mean, it kind of is.
00:24:49 It's a little bit of a circle.
00:24:52 Is it?
00:24:53 I swear I heard someone say that.
00:24:54 Yeah, I haven't heard or something like that.
00:24:56 That Breath of the Wild is the Dark Souls of Zelda.
00:24:59 Wait, I didn't Dark Souls.
00:25:01 Wait, I didn't Dark Souls start the whole like, oh, you can just walk up
00:25:04 to the final boss if you want to.
00:25:07 I mean, not exactly.
00:25:10 Not really, no.
00:25:11 I think the connection is that people used to say that Dark Souls
00:25:16 is like Legend of Zelda, but realistic.
00:25:18 Yeah, Dark Souls, like the most direct lineage of Dark Souls combat
00:25:24 is to like Ocarina of Time, like Lock on Z targeting.
00:25:29 Like, Dark Souls is like a direct ancestor of that anyway.
00:25:34 OK, so basically Dark Souls is the Dark Souls of Zelda, I would say
00:25:41 it would be a more accurate comparison.
00:25:43 Is it like a bad game or take to say that, like, this is probably going
00:25:49 to get a lot of people mad with it.
00:25:51 And the people who hate me are going to hate me more after I say this.
00:25:54 But you don't want to offend those people.
00:25:58 I especially don't want to offend those, I don't want to offend the hate
00:26:01 fandom that big Twitter artist has.
00:26:05 But yeah, all these all these like from soft games
00:26:08 look like the same to me.
00:26:11 Is that is that is that bad to say?
00:26:13 They all just look this.
00:26:14 No, I agree.
00:26:16 I the the the yeah.
00:26:19 You're talking like I mean that I could ring.
00:26:22 A round and ring looks like Dark Souls.
00:26:25 Yeah, like exactly the same thing that I haven't played it.
00:26:27 So all these games have this kind of like
00:26:31 gray, kind of like, I want to say edgy filters.
00:26:35 It has like some sort of filter over them.
00:26:37 Like all the games seem to have this filter.
00:26:39 You might even call it a style or something.
00:26:41 It's it's supposed to be like Dour and Depressing.
00:26:44 Yeah, like things are fucked.
00:26:46 Here's a sword.
00:26:47 Like that's the idea of like of all the the Souls series is like things are
00:26:53 fucked. Here's a sword.
00:26:54 Also, you're probably decrepit and is like it's really sad.
00:26:58 You're going to die.
00:26:59 You're going to die one day in that day is today.
00:27:01 Isn't like every so like it makes sense that there'd be a lot of grays.
00:27:07 But I'd like it to be like a pink one.
00:27:08 Yeah, why is there going to be a pink one?
00:27:10 He is like my favorite color.
00:27:11 I keep saying I keep saying they need to make they make armored corps.
00:27:16 They should make a Souls like where you're a mech.
00:27:19 They should make armored bore.
00:27:20 Oh, my God.
00:27:21 They should make one about being mechs.
00:27:23 And instead of like weapons and armor, you're equipping fucking mech mech parts,
00:27:27 treads and rocket launchers.
00:27:30 I don't know.
00:27:31 It could be pretty cool if you ask me.
00:27:33 Instead of sorceries and wood and pyromancy, you got guns.
00:27:38 I don't know.
00:27:38 Why not?
00:27:39 I want like the I want like Dark Soul, which I never played to have
00:27:45 like a Dragon Quest aesthetic, which I never played.
00:27:48 That's that's what I want.
00:27:49 I aesthetically, they do look pretty similar.
00:27:52 And I'm not like I'm not super into like the way they look.
00:27:56 They look fine.
00:27:56 I can tell Dark Souls to a part because Dark Souls to looks worse.
00:28:01 Yeah.
00:28:02 Dark Souls to looks like Goofy air.
00:28:04 That's that's funny.
00:28:07 There's a few nice places in Dark Souls to it's not like overall.
00:28:12 Yeah, overall.
00:28:12 I don't know exactly.
00:28:13 It's just no, it's the models.
00:28:15 Different feelings.
00:28:16 Something about the like the character model
00:28:19 and maybe the enemy models just looks.
00:28:22 So I feel like maybe it looks cartoonier.
00:28:27 And so I don't know.
00:28:28 I don't ever heard that that's before game, but that sounds interesting.
00:28:35 Yeah, I remember thinking when you put when you have like a lightning weapon,
00:28:40 the way that in Dark Souls to like when you apply lightning
00:28:44 or something to your weapon, it just it doesn't just have like a lightning bolt
00:28:47 effect like an electrified effect.
00:28:49 It glows.
00:28:50 It turns like a stupid like bright primary color like, oh, it's yellow now.
00:28:55 It's like, I hate that.
00:28:58 I feel like all of them do that a little bit.
00:29:00 No, Dark Souls one, maybe I mean, I didn't play I haven't played three.
00:29:05 Dark Souls one, it doesn't turn your sword like yellow
00:29:08 when you make it when you use a, you know, gold pine resin on it or whatever.
00:29:12 It gives it like a little thunderbolts coming off.
00:29:15 Yeah, yeah, I haven't noticed that.
00:29:19 Stood out to me, not in a great way.
00:29:22 Anyway, who cares about Elden Ring?
00:29:24 Yeah, if you got any more game development thoughts on that,
00:29:29 I have many things to say because it's been like, I don't know.
00:29:33 Yeah, that I've been like talking about it, but not talking about it.
00:29:37 Yeah, have people found everything in the game that you like have set up
00:29:43 or there's some more secrets that are that lay in the game
00:29:47 that people haven't stumbled into yet.
00:29:49 I haven't seen anybody who's found all the lizards
00:29:53 and aside from that, there is something that nobody has figured out yet.
00:29:59 Really? OK.
00:30:01 There's an aspect of the game that nobody has figured out yet.
00:30:04 Can you and it's a little obscure.
00:30:06 So that's all I'm telling you about that one.
00:30:08 It's going to be funny.
00:30:10 It's going to be cool if anyone finds it.
00:30:12 Can you? OK, I don't.
00:30:14 Can you be any more specific than aspect?
00:30:18 Uh, is it like a I don't know.
00:30:24 Is it like a little scrambler?
00:30:25 Well, is a scrambler going to show up?
00:30:27 It's all right. Here's here's what it's not.
00:30:29 It's not like a physical location in the game that's hard to reach.
00:30:34 It's nothing like that. Is it like, I don't know.
00:30:37 My mind goes to like, is there is the mechanic?
00:30:40 Is there like, is there like a backwards long jump?
00:30:44 No, it's not like a movement thing, either.
00:30:46 That would be funny if we made like movement controls
00:30:49 that didn't like was so hard to figure out that nobody would ever use this.
00:30:54 Oh, I got it. There's a there's a what do you call them?
00:31:00 Coupes, there's QPUs. There's QPUs.
00:31:02 You can you can QPU misalign yourself in parallel world.
00:31:07 That's right.
00:31:08 If you get stuck when you're in the full animation, you stay there.
00:31:11 You go parallel universe.
00:31:14 You build up speed.
00:31:15 You build up speed for 12 hours until you you warp to the next world down below.
00:31:20 People have made that joke.
00:31:21 It does kind of look like you could build up speed.
00:31:24 Yeah, because because because you're continually falling.
00:31:27 You're stuck in the falling animation. I did.
00:31:30 I almost got.
00:31:32 Well, I was jumping around in mountains
00:31:35 and I got pumped stuck in the between two ledges, infinite falling.
00:31:39 And Ali looked normal and I wanted to get Ali
00:31:43 to take a picture of pump in that state.
00:31:46 But I think Ali was also considered to be falling.
00:31:50 So I couldn't get her to go into the the take a picture.
00:31:53 Did she have her arms up?
00:31:55 Was she a falling animation?
00:31:56 She didn't know she looked normal.
00:31:58 She no, I remember thinking she did not look like she was falling,
00:32:01 but she could not take her phone out either.
00:32:04 So it didn't work out.
00:32:07 If you can control Ali, you can walk around.
00:32:09 You should be able to use the phone.
00:32:10 Um, I think I could maneuver her a little bit.
00:32:16 But she was she was also stuck in the left.
00:32:19 Yeah, she didn't.
00:32:21 But I could sort of move her.
00:32:22 She could sort of like, well, that makes sense.
00:32:24 Wiggle her a bit from left to right.
00:32:26 She's got a thing.
00:32:27 She's got a thing where, like, if she's moving too fast or.
00:32:32 Or something, she'll you'll be forced out of the phone mode.
00:32:38 Or I think I haven't tried this.
00:32:41 I think it's you you throw Ali up.
00:32:45 No, no, that wouldn't work.
00:32:47 There's something something to do with, like, no, when you.
00:32:50 Yeah, you can pick up and if you didn't know, if you didn't know,
00:32:53 you can pick up and throw Ali open.
00:32:54 She bounces like a bouncy ball against objects and it's funny.
00:32:59 But, like, if she's using her phone and she gets thrown,
00:33:04 but she wouldn't be.
00:33:04 You wouldn't break her phone and then you can't use that for no more.
00:33:08 She she's forced out of the phone mode for various little reasons
00:33:11 like that, I think.
00:33:12 It's just the main thing I I don't know.
00:33:14 I don't know if this is an intentional bit of like, developer comedy.
00:33:20 Or or just bad conveyance.
00:33:24 But it's probably the second different thing.
00:33:26 I'm talking about the first Ali grotto that I found.
00:33:30 There's a sign right outside of it
00:33:32 that says you can return to pump at any time by pressing.
00:33:36 I think it is shift I didn't try it, but I came back later and when you when Ali goes into the grotto
00:33:43 No, you cannot you can't you can't actually can't do it while you're while she's in the cave
00:33:48 Only when she's out in the overall which makes sense
00:33:50 And I get why you wouldn't want because if you could do that then you would become pump again
00:33:55 And you would be stuck without Ali. She'd be back in the in the cave
00:33:59 Yeah, the the the reason we did that was because when Ali is way away from punk
00:34:04 She'll teleport to her if you're playing as punk. Yeah, and it was like confusing and difficult to like account for
00:34:11 Ali being in the cave and if you accidentally switch back to punk and then suddenly Ali like teleports to you as punk
00:34:18 You'll lose every all progress you had in the cave and we didn't want that so we have like cave zones where
00:34:24 Ali is unable to switch back. Yeah, he has a little moment and then she gets out
00:34:29 we might rework that because
00:34:32 I
00:34:33 Mean funny, I guess that you are immediately told you can switch back. Don't worry about it and you actually I think it's fine
00:34:40 You're in there. It didn't like I mean
00:34:42 if I
00:34:44 It would not it would not have frustrated me. I would have been like. Oh, well, whatever lol now. I get it
00:34:51 It's fine. I'll just go back out this door. Okay
00:34:54 See ya
00:34:55 Yeah, people said Ali. It's a little too slow. I think we're gonna increase her speed
00:35:00 It's not so much of a slot. She's pretty slow. I didn't I didn't find it too frustrating
00:35:06 Yeah, but like
00:35:08 Obviously things like this is
00:35:10 We wanted to have like a slice of like all the different aspects of game development game
00:35:16 Mechanics that you could interact with and Ali going into little caves
00:35:20 Not all of them are planned to be like that size
00:35:23 Some of them might be a bit longer more involved
00:35:26 Or there might be like a puzzle involved where you have to be Ali and punk and switch between them or something
00:35:32 so
00:35:34 the
00:35:36 things about like
00:35:38 Playing as the character need to be fun. We're thinking of giving Ali a little jump as well
00:35:42 Not like a big jump, but just something so the tiny little
00:35:46 Things on the floor don't get an array. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
00:35:51 Yeah, she can't move
00:35:54 Just can't move at all
00:35:55 So, but I mean that's that's that's character design. What is um when is shovel night gonna show up in the game?
00:36:04 This is an indie game after all right, we're gonna
00:36:08 We're gonna have a shovel where and night he comes in he's like hey
00:36:12 Do you want some cheap shit and you buy hey?
00:36:15 Do you want to buy a Chippendales rescue Rangers on the Game Boy Advance like where you want to play shitty games?
00:36:24 I
00:36:27 Says that and then Ali it's like yeah, I got a GBA adapter on my phone
00:36:32 And then you can play Chippendale in in and pumpkin alley. That's a intended feature that is definitely not been just made
00:36:39 Yeah, you the game the game the game comes with an emulator
00:36:43 You can you can play any any like Super Nintendo or NES emulator you can play it in the game
00:36:50 In yeah on on elliops in elliops phone mode like far away from the screen like in vertical
00:36:58 Yeah, like terrible resolution
00:37:01 In in like low low lower colors can converted to like cyan cyan and pink and yellow
00:37:09 Yeah, good pretty epic. See him. See I see him like a bee
00:37:15 That's pretty epic
00:37:17 It was pretty epic any any more gamer questions you got forget those are all those are all my notes
00:37:23 Those are all my complaints
00:37:26 I'm trying to think if there was any
00:37:32 I what did you like about it? What did I like about it?
00:37:35 Um, I liked running around like Spyro the dragon. I like Spyro the dragon. You know what? Yeah, you know
00:37:42 You know what I didn't like actually here's a good one. I think that I think that that what did you like about it?
00:37:46 Nothing. Here's some stuff that sucks. Um, I think the the
00:37:51 The plants burning burning the plants was a little bit. I didn't like realize they were burning until they weren't like later
00:37:59 I feel like the difference could be like more dramatic. I don't know. It took me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I
00:38:06 Had to kind of be like are these what did I do anything by that? Um, yeah
00:38:12 I
00:38:14 Don't know. That's it. My minor minor gripe
00:38:18 Yes, it's it's to do with them. There's like a layer
00:38:23 for the thorns and the grass
00:38:27 Where like I had to make a layer of a gradient and
00:38:32 The color of the gradient determines what order it gets like burned away
00:38:37 in the and sort of like
00:38:40 Like if you burn a thorn bush, it'll like shrink and then there'll be like embery bits
00:38:44 Yeah, and it'll it'll follow that that mat or whatever you call it
00:38:48 Yeah, but for the grass I kind of fucked up the gradient a little bit
00:38:51 And so it sort of doesn't do much at first and then then quite quickly goes to nothing. Yeah, okay
00:38:57 So it looks like nothing's happening, but yeah, we're gonna redo the grass. Yeah
00:39:01 What's a little I mean the grass doesn't even like do anything so like whatever it doesn't even matter if it's there or not
00:39:07 Yeah, people like burning it. Yeah, some people were saying
00:39:11 Why isn't there rupees in this? Why isn't there stuff in this?
00:39:14 and I think we were thinking of doing that, but it was just sort of like
00:39:18 quite late in
00:39:20 Like we wanted to get the demo out
00:39:23 There's lots of little bits that we could have like spent maybe another few days on a few, you know a week or two
00:39:28 to iron it out perfectly, which is why there's so many glitches and stuff, but
00:39:33 That's the the idea is just to make it real get people hype was there and then you know, yeah all that was there
00:39:41 was there something in there that like
00:39:45 You didn't have to add
00:39:47 But you were like I want to add this and like it ended up being like
00:39:52 Oh, but that was like way more trouble than it was worth like I spent like we spent like a month adding this stupid thing and like well
00:39:59 I think I think most things that we ended up spending a lot of time on
00:40:05 Are worth because people like them. Yeah, they're just sort of like
00:40:09 Maybe arguably like time investment to enjoyment gained is like skewed. I think I'm Ali Oop's phone and her camera
00:40:20 Considering maybe not doing that, but it was funny
00:40:23 Just to be able to take a selfie even if the selfie camera is quite like you couldn't really angle it in a way
00:40:29 So you could see things. Yeah, but it was it's funny that you can do it at all. It is funny
00:40:34 It would be I mean, I mean, it's it's just yeah, it's just it's just funny and like
00:40:40 What's flight flavorful? I guess thematic character building that it's in the game. Yeah at all. Yeah
00:40:46 I think I've said this before but this was a lot of a lot of my
00:40:51 experience with the phantom's revenge is
00:40:54 Being like hey, I got a little funny idea for something I can add. Haha wouldn't it? Yeah, whatever
00:41:00 Hey, I'll just do this thing and then it takes me like several weeks and I'm like
00:41:06 Regretting it and I'm like, why did I do this? Like why did I decide why did I decide to add floor reflections?
00:41:11 Why did I decide to add like, you know a dynamic blood splatter on like the walls and stuff?
00:41:18 Yeah
00:41:20 Yeah, there's definitely moments where I'm like, ah, how about this and I say to Charlie
00:41:25 What would it be like a big load of hassle and terrible coding nightmares if we did this tiny little thing?
00:41:32 And he goes, yeah, ah
00:41:34 Yes, it would and I'm like, okay, we don't need to do it and we'll we'll not do it you
00:41:40 You poached you poached Charlie from me give I
00:41:45 Did yeah, you gave you gave me told him you wanted you gave me Charlie and then you took him back for me
00:41:56 How could you Indian give her how could you poach? How could you poach your own brother?
00:42:03 Well, yeah, I'm taking it been taken. Oh my god. It was oh my god
00:42:09 I
00:42:11 Remember I remember that
00:42:14 Charlie cuz he was like, you know, he made a runaway from snakes
00:42:18 Yeah, and he was like working on little projects here and there and I was like, okay Tom
00:42:25 Does game development work?
00:42:26 Maybe you should talk to Tom and like do things and that never really happened because Tom wants to be in control of his thing
00:42:32 And they didn't really talk so it's like yeah, whatever. Yeah, but Ben you were talking about making a game
00:42:36 Hey Charlie go talk to Ben about this thing. Yeah, you know, you know, it's thing
00:42:41 Yeah, and then apparently you didn't get back to him. So it's just like I don't know what to do
00:42:44 Yeah, I was a bit anything else happening. Yeah, I was a bit of a dick
00:42:48 I didn't get back to him for a while because I think I've said this before I
00:42:52 Sort of told him what this is when I had not even really started working on the game
00:42:56 But I was like, I think I think this was this was when I was working on the s revert animation
00:43:02 I was like, but I know I'm gonna make the game and I was talking to
00:43:07 Charlie and I was I told him like what the game was
00:43:10 Kind of gonna be I kind of said like here's my idea for it
00:43:13 It was pretty rough at the time and he he was like hey, I prototyped this thing like what do you think and it was
00:43:21 Not it was not
00:43:23 Exactly what I had envisioned it was something a little different. It wasn't because it wasn't like a straight-up ghosted him after that
00:43:30 I
00:43:31 Did eventually get back to him. It was it was I didn't I didn't know what to say because it was like
00:43:37 This is this is good and all but it's not what I was
00:43:41 picturing and like
00:43:43 What do I do I?
00:43:45 Should I just say like no or should I just be like hey change it or should I and I think I
00:43:52 Just wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I think eventually I decided like I kind of I kind of just want to make it myself
00:43:58 I thought I was fucking do it myself
00:44:00 Then so yeah, I hope yeah, I hope I hope I guess it all worked out
00:44:06 Yeah, yeah, I mean it's really just a thing of
00:44:11 Communication it's harder to communicate through discord messages and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah
00:44:16 It's for me to just go up and talk to him like when we're developing the game
00:44:20 We're in the same room. He's coding things and I'm like either drawing or like fucking around thinking
00:44:25 Yes, and then we like have discussions about how do you think this should work? I'm like, okay, let's think um
00:44:32 conveyance
00:44:33 in an in an alternate in an alternate universe where I had been like I
00:44:39 Had jumped on it and I had been like, okay, Charlie. No, no, you got to rework this here
00:44:43 You got to make you got to make it like this. You got to you got to do like this
00:44:46 You got to add this you got to add that I
00:44:49 Yeah, I imagine the process of like
00:44:52 get him him
00:44:53 Making changes to the prototype sending them back to me me be I'm like, okay change this this this and that and then like
00:45:00 Sending it back waiting for him to do that getting it back. I imagine that would have been
00:45:04 painstaking
00:45:07 So a little bit. Yeah, maybe it's probably fine
00:45:11 I
00:45:14 Must it is must be nice to have a to have a code guy though must be nice to have a brother
00:45:20 Must be yeah
00:45:22 Yeah, must be nice. Oh well
00:45:27 He doesn't know that feeling at all, right Ben
00:45:31 Not it not anymore
00:45:34 Although I mean, I don't regret I don't regret learning I don't regret learning GML I
00:45:40 Feel like I learned I feel like I learned a lot of code
00:45:43 Working on it. Yeah, but I can keep using in the future. I don't need a code guy. I'll never need a code guy again
00:45:50 Coding is easy. Yeah, coding is easy by the way
00:45:53 It's literally it's literally just looking up how to just you literally just Google
00:45:57 How do I do this and there's someone wrote it's like you type this and you go okay?
00:46:01 Yeah, I think I've seen a car kind of you just Google how to fix a car and then they should just tell you right there
00:46:06 I mean unironically unironically
00:46:10 Coding is like fixing a car only
00:46:12 Nothing happens if you fuck it up and you can just keep trying until it works. So yeah, basically the easiest thing
00:46:18 Okay, that's I'll learn to code right now, but for me. Yeah coding. Yeah, coding is like it's interesting
00:46:26 but it's like
00:46:27 The the skill floor like you need to like get a ladder to get to that floor
00:46:33 Before you're like actually able to
00:46:36 creatively solve problems with like idea like knowledge of like, okay, this kind of code would work
00:46:42 If this and that so I'll just make a thing and then I'll experiment like it would take a long time for me to get to the
00:46:49 experimental phase of being a programmer
00:46:51 Which is the fun part and copy pasting stuff only works if someone else has done it
00:46:57 And if you're trying to make something specific, it's sometimes not
00:47:01 Easy to find that you know at least not a good teacher, you know, I'm thinking about it
00:47:07 And I'm realizing that I am a genius because again yet again
00:47:12 I'm coming to I'm how many how many times must I have the same revelation over and over again of what a genius I am
00:47:19 How many different fields? How many different mountains must I conquer before I'm finally finished already?
00:47:27 The the it was just like in in vapors. I had never made a comic and I was like, well, I guess I guess I'll just do it
00:47:34 I guess I'll just start working on it and I'll figure it out as I went along and that was and then I did and
00:47:40 Then same with phantom's revenge coding. I'm just like, well, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna start making it like I don't know
00:47:45 What I'm doing, but I fuck it. I'll just figure it out and I did
00:47:49 And yeah, and and I just just keep chiseled just keep hammering away at it until it's how you want it
00:47:55 And in the process you discover how to do those things and then you're like well
00:48:00 It is definitely possible or it would have been definitely possible for me to make pump canali myself by myself
00:48:07 All right, probably it just would have taken like four years instead of right like nine months, right?
00:48:13 Yeah, four to five to six years. It would take a long time
00:48:16 I guess Charlie has been learning to code for a long time or are you pretty long time?
00:48:20 He went to uni for three years for it and also he's just been like extra curricular like coding all the time
00:48:27 He loves I don't think he loves coding, but he loves making games and being interested in like trying to find out how to do things
00:48:34 Yeah, yeah once a coding university and you went to PCP University and finally a brought both talents together
00:48:42 To fuse and make this ultimate product for the masses
00:48:48 Yes
00:48:51 PCP is is only game. It's only game game people now damn
00:48:57 It's can't watch it no more. I can't relate. Yeah, can't can relate no more
00:49:03 tech bro
00:49:05 Once you become a game developer all of your comics. Yeah, yeah
00:49:10 Yeah, they're swept away in the tide. It's the source for us lost. Where is she she's gone?
00:49:16 Yeah, true. It's it's just like it's just like toy store, you know everyone nobody wants to play with cowboy toys anymore
00:49:24 Everyone want now everyone wants space toys as soon as Sputnik went up, you know everything changed
00:49:28 Is it's kind of like when I switched over from short films to comics my short film side doesn't exist anymore?
00:49:36 They just they just
00:49:38 They just melt it away
00:49:41 Yeah, you like dismantle them and use the skill points to put into new. Oh, I actually
00:49:48 I actually am currently doing that exact same thing you just described right now
00:49:54 They melt it away like something melting away
00:49:57 No, I mean they melt it away like something
00:49:59 I won't specify in the scene that I'm drawing in in slime and punishment right now because it would be a spoiler for the end
00:50:06 For the end my god
00:50:07 Does phantom horn get melted into a skeleton of horn like if you lose the game?
00:50:12 That definitely phantom horn shoot like buckets of cum and it looks like it's like it's like melting in their hand
00:50:19 That happens
00:50:21 I'm not gonna answer any I can't answer that
00:50:25 Cuz it's true. I can't answer that specific question
00:50:28 Yeah, you can't you can't give any direction on that question cuz if you if you had asked anything else
00:50:33 I could tell you no, but unfortunately
00:50:35 I can't answer that specific query either positively or not actually um
00:50:40 It's like the idea that you do the whole phantoms revenge like slime and punishment comic and right at the end
00:50:47 It becomes extremely explicit 18 plus poor and that's how villain versus gonna end and then
00:50:52 And that's the reward for getting to the end
00:50:55 There's instead of like it's like instead of like a confirm
00:50:58 Are you over the age of 18 before you see it instead?
00:51:01 I have you beat a video game cuz I'm like only a heart only a hardcore gamer could see this pornography
00:51:10 That'll show there they're mature, you know ages just a number right ages just a number and you just gotta you gotta prove
00:51:15 It's your epic gaming skill is more important than like what's on your driver's license if you want to read my porn or be my girlfriend
00:51:23 I didn't I shouldn't say that on a podcast. It's really about that'll be quoted
00:51:28 It's really about mental maturity
00:51:29 People think I'm serious, you know in and gaming and gaming skill is
00:51:35 The best indicator science has yet found it's better than IQ
00:51:39 It's you have to be quite mature. I have no video game
00:51:43 Especially one that's like a have to be spin off of a spin off of a based on
00:51:49 Another bullshit that Benzane is doing
00:51:52 That's right. That's right. Um, yes
00:51:55 Wait, that's the big difference in the games is that mine has this market appeal because it's just two characters
00:52:01 Yeah, man, that's the formula, you know, there's um, there's punk and Ali and there's bongo and Luna. That's that's the two
00:52:08 It's always the two
00:52:10 Phantom always to handsome and horn Phantom and Phantom and who?
00:52:14 Phantom and who? There's no one there. Yeah, Phantom's got a sidekick. Phantom's got his little his little pet
00:52:22 He can he's got he's also got platinum
00:52:24 You know his trusty sidekick platinum the sword who he can marry now in the game if you so choose
00:52:32 Can you kiss the sword and cut your lip you can kiss the sword it doesn't cut your lip though because phantom's very he's pretty good
00:52:39 He knows how to handle knows how to think he's an experience. He's an experienced love knows how to use his tongue
00:52:44 Right, you know, so if you know the amateur tongue kisser, of course, you'll cut your your lip
00:52:50 But unlike phantom horn lots of experience
00:52:52 I mean, I mean if you're if you're cutting your lip when you kiss your sword, you know
00:52:56 You're your gaming skill level is not high enough for you to be getting married in my sort of mental disorder
00:53:02 If you cut your lip while kissing a sword really that's my opinion. It's my take of the day
00:53:06 And you it shouldn't be happening if you're a gamer. True. Let's just let's just let's just put it that way
00:53:14 Shit, I feel I was gonna was I gonna mention? Oh, oh, I do have one
00:53:19 Yeah, I had one thing to mention. It's not exactly relevant
00:53:25 Should I should I say it? Well, if it's I'm just gonna know you go first
00:53:31 the the pumpkin early thing
00:53:34 to wrap up
00:53:35 Play that game
00:53:38 In terms of in terms of like what's gonna happen in the future
00:53:43 Yeah, we're gonna be working on it
00:53:45 I think in March and just just working just like doing some things maybe have a little hot fix patch for some of the
00:53:51 The more obvious and easy to fix problems, right?
00:53:55 Not gonna be an overhaul or anything, but we may once my Lord of Ghost Kickstarter is all squared away and done
00:54:03 We may be doing a Kickstarter to raise funds for paying for the making of the whole thing
00:54:08 Yeah, I was wondering about so stay tuned for for potential that I'm not entirely sure how long it's gonna take and stuff
00:54:16 We'll have to like figure out costs and and things
00:54:20 Yeah, but that's the general idea because it seems like that it seems like lots of people want that
00:54:25 It's the sort of normal thing that an indie game studio could do. Yeah, and I think it would work pretty well
00:54:30 Really release a demo and then kickstart development on the full game. Yeah makes it makes sense to me
00:54:39 Do you I?
00:54:42 guess do you
00:54:44 Have anything you are
00:54:47 You're like we're for sure gonna add this that you want to mention
00:54:53 And well for sure
00:54:56 Uh
00:54:57 There's there's dialogue things
00:55:01 That we couldn't get done for the demo
00:55:04 Obviously, there's gonna be NPCs and and things there's lots of different zones wait wait
00:55:11 Yes, I had a complaint there was at least one time when a signs dialogue box would not advance
00:55:19 I like mashed the F key or I like mashed the key for a while before that damn
00:55:24 Dialogue box advance. Yes, the dialogue box event was a little bit weird. Yeah
00:55:31 I just remembered that just nice
00:55:35 Quality of life upgrades not really upgrades, but just sort of like fixes
00:55:40 Like that. We're we're we're tallying them up. We're gonna go through the wall. Okay fix them. Okay
00:55:46 if anybody has like
00:55:48 Thoughts complaints go to the pumpkin alley itch.io community tab and leave like a a post
00:55:57 Detailing everything because when we're going to like check everything
00:56:00 It's the easiest place to go and like double-check what people thought
00:56:05 What the criticisms were?
00:56:07 So we can like look at them all at the in one place. Yeah. Yeah, so
00:56:14 Anyway, you were saying you were saying
00:56:18 You were you were enumerating things you were going to add which I'm curious about. Oh, yeah
00:56:23 So there's there's boss battles. Yeah, and lots of enemies
00:56:27 I kind of what the design philosophy for for combat is that I don't want it to be like God of War
00:56:34 It's not like a combat heavy game. Yeah, and when you do fight an enemy. I want it to be
00:56:39 More of a puzzle than just running at something and setting in the moon fire. Yeah
00:56:45 Maybe there could be some easier enemies like that, but that would feel like padding but maybe
00:56:50 But like generally they'll be like, oh this enemy has some sort of shield that you need to like
00:56:55 Knock off before you can burn them or this enemy. Yeah is made of a material that can't be burned
00:57:00 Unless you change something in the environment that makes them burnable, you know, that's the sort of idea for the buses and
00:57:07 And and enemies. Yeah, so that's gonna be expanded a lot that the mushroom was is pretty good
00:57:13 I think it explains that yeah, the most that is a puzzle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the mushroom is I
00:57:19 He kind of jump-scared me a little bit when he like the idea
00:57:23 Yeah, when he first yeah when he first yells and like the music changes. I was like, oh my god. What the fuck?
00:57:29 Yeah, I didn't because there had not I didn't think there were any enemies in the game. So I was like
00:57:36 Yeah, it gotcha. Yeah, it got me it got me a little bit
00:57:40 Uh, whatever. There's there's there's a dialogue system. There's like
00:57:46 I'm not entirely sure how we're gonna do this. I had this idea
00:57:51 Initially that like you could press a button to like chat with the other character
00:57:55 So like you could just say something and and the dialogue that they have would be like
00:58:01 Contextual contextual to like the the room or like the general zone that you're in
00:58:07 And there would be like pulling from a pool of like possible chat options. Yes
00:58:11 And if there's like a puzzle room you could press the button
00:58:14 And punk would say what do you think and ali would say? I don't fucking know like you just have like a little
00:58:20 Maybe it could be a helpful thing. Wait a second. I don't know how easy that would be to program though for like every room to have a little
00:58:26 little potential dialogue, but that's uh, it's an idea
00:58:29 I mean, that's not
00:58:32 It it could be I mean, I mean
00:58:34 Phantom's revenge has a little uh has a little you know not not to brag or anything
00:58:38 But Phantom's revenge has a little contextual dialogue where in every room you can examine every enemy and you can examine the room
00:58:44 And you can examine everything and depending on where you are you'll get a little different different dialogue boxes
00:58:51 so there it's it's it's like um the the issue is like
00:58:56 One if a dialogue box appears on screen, are you still able to move and will that halt the flow of platforming?
00:59:04 And if it doesn't halt the flow
00:59:06 Will it get in the way of like visually because they don't speak English they go
00:59:12 They're gonna have like a animal crossing or okami or banjo banjo kazooie is the one that jumps to my hand
00:59:20 Um, they're gonna talk like that. So it's gonna have to be in text and
00:59:26 I don't know how that's gonna fit with like
00:59:28 gameplay
00:59:30 unnecessarily
00:59:31 um
00:59:32 But there's definitely gonna be like dialogue scenes where like you there's like a threshold and it's a kind of a cut scene
00:59:38 Where they talk about the story or whatever and they talk to an mpc or something like that
00:59:43 Does ali talk in bell jpe?
00:59:47 Um in bell jpe there there's like a few moments where they speak but like there's no like quotes
00:59:53 Yeah in in the text the text underneath each image is like the narrator saying what's happening
00:59:58 Um, or like if you are a punk you do this and you do that and you say to ali that's fucking sick
01:00:05 um
01:00:06 But like they don't have like speech bubbles and there's no like quotes at the bottom to to to be able to tell
01:00:11 But there is at least one place. I remember where like
01:00:15 um
01:00:16 ali and pump have
01:00:17 Reunited after run away from snakes the game and panel
01:00:23 And they're saying something about stuff and ali has her phone back
01:00:29 Excellent, so they speak do I gotta me spare gotta play run away from snakes before I get into this
01:00:36 Yeah, yeah, you have to play run away from snakes or the game won't make any sense
01:00:39 You got you got to read bell jpe and play the the run away from snakes panel
01:00:43 Which is a video game panel that is a is a panel of the comic and also a video game
01:00:48 It's an endless runner. It's fun. It's hard, but it's it's it's a lord
01:00:54 There was is there still a leaderboard for that?
01:00:57 I think that broke. Um
01:00:59 That part of the thing was so confusing and terrible idea
01:01:05 um
01:01:07 When it broke, we were like, no, we'll leave it. No, you know, it's fine. It's fine. Yeah
01:01:14 I mean, it was fun. It was fun to fuck around with while it was while it was uh happening though
01:01:20 Yeah
01:01:27 Oh, I had um
01:01:29 Yeah, the thing I was gonna say was I had a
01:01:32 I had a
01:01:33 An idea for the the eventual
01:01:36 Book form for slime and punishment, which by the way
01:01:40 I guess I'll be curious to know when you wanted when you're gonna do
01:01:43 Uh, a kickstarter for that because I am I'm gonna kickstart the book
01:01:48 And I don't want to run our kick starters at the same time. So, um, yeah, sure. I mean, um
01:01:54 It will depend
01:01:56 On first I think march is gonna be my love ghosts kickstarter
01:02:01 Backer reward like finally finish all of that stuff send them off
01:02:06 And then it'll be either during march or in april
01:02:11 Figuring out the kickstarter and then maybe launching it sometime in april. I guess
01:02:18 Yeah, but I don't know yet. It'll maybe it'll depend on how long it takes for me to do all the the lord of ghosts stuff
01:02:25 Yeah, well, I mean I want to hmm. I mean, I guess I'd see no reason
01:02:30 I guess I'm gonna try and run the
01:02:33 Slime and punishment kickstarter as soon as I I can
01:02:37 So maybe I mean I might kind of like finish the comic and then basically immediately try to
01:02:43 You know figure out how I'm gonna print it and yeah, and it'll it'll just depend on how long it takes me to settle on like
01:02:49 Okay, this is the final design of the book. These are the printers. I'm going with
01:02:54 Okay
01:02:55 Yeah, so that's that's what uh
01:02:58 That's what that depends on
01:03:00 but anyway
01:03:01 I I had thought right I had envisioned
01:03:05 Slime and punishment as being like
01:03:07 The problem sleuth books. I haven't read the homestuck books
01:03:10 So I don't know if they're the same but the problem sleuth books generally have four panels on a page and then at the bottom
01:03:17 um
01:03:18 Andrew hussey has a running commentary where every page he has little uh
01:03:23 Little notes about the panels and I was gonna do that
01:03:27 but I think
01:03:29 A lot of panels like a lot of pages I could but I don't know if I have something to say on every page
01:03:33 So I think it actually might be better and maybe also funnier
01:03:38 I think the way I might actually end up doing it
01:03:41 Is to have like an index section at the end with footnotes
01:03:46 Like infinite jest, you know infinite jest has like the whole book is full of like little
01:03:51 Asterisks that lead to the back and there's a whole like there's like
01:03:55 Several chapters worth of like
01:03:58 Notes and indexes and like little side stories that relate to uh, whatever
01:04:02 So I think I'm gonna have an index section where I will have little asterisks that will direct you to a part where I
01:04:10 explain like
01:04:11 This is this is why I
01:04:14 This was the context that made me add this to the story or oh, yeah the the the the player
01:04:20 Avatars that are depicted on these pages are are these people
01:04:24 Or does the homesick books do that? I thought they did do that, right?
01:04:28 That they would have the little commentary. I don't know it
01:04:32 They do they do I have some of them word. They have a little they have a little index
01:04:36 They have an index section not an index. No, they have the the comments right on the page, right?
01:04:42 Right on the page at the bottom. Yeah, I just I just explained that my original idea was going to be that
01:04:46 But I think I want to have it in a I want to have
01:04:49 I want to have foot I want to have foot footnotes in their own section like annotated almost, right?
01:04:54 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, because it definitely needs it. It definitely needs that for certain things
01:05:00 that might be a little confusing or
01:05:03 something like
01:05:05 in the
01:05:06 In the index section is probably where I would put
01:05:10 For instance, there are some panels that there are some pages of it that are me
01:05:15 Recreating or like pseudo recreating
01:05:18 Drawings that chris chan did and I would probably like have a little
01:05:23 asterisk that would direct you to a page in the index where I'd be like
01:05:27 Yeah, here are the original images that these
01:05:30 Panels were were based on a referencing or something like that
01:05:34 Because I couldn't I couldn't fit that in a I couldn't fit that in us in a foot. You should um
01:05:38 You should do it that every time you mentioned chris chan
01:05:41 You write another like little mention right next to chris chan's name saying yeah, yeah, I know I know they're in jail
01:05:47 Yeah, I know about the several things he did and
01:05:49 But I've got every time in a book in a book in a book. I leave a little footnote
01:05:54 That's like, yeah, please don't comment telling me uh about the chris chan being in jail. I I know
01:05:59 Please and then at the end of the book. I should put please like comment and subscribe
01:06:04 Uh, ring the bell. Yeah, and then you should um, yeah, you should just yeah
01:06:08 You should drop off the book at a random bookstore and then people be like what the fuck is this what the
01:06:13 What the niche hell shit bullshit internet bullshit is this?
01:06:19 That's the brand I
01:06:21 Yeah, I guess that is the brand. I guess that is the brand. Um, I'm just allergic to mass market appeal
01:06:29 I I I would be
01:06:31 You know what if anybody actually likes if anyone actually liked my game
01:06:36 I would be disappointed in myself. I would hate them. I would if you like my game. Fuck you
01:06:42 You're an idiot. I made that game specifically to attract the kind of people I hate
01:06:47 So if you like it that means I fucking hate you
01:06:50 I made that game specifically to be
01:06:54 I made the game specifically to be fun on its own
01:06:58 In a way that people that had not read the comic could enjoy anyway
01:07:02 But in a way that is also sort of very strongly gesturing towards
01:07:06 Hey, hey, hey, check the comic out. Hey
01:07:10 You should read the comic if you want additional context on like what's going on in this game
01:07:14 You don't have to read the comic, but like you should you should read you should read the comic though
01:07:19 Please, please read the comic
01:07:22 Please please read the comic
01:07:24 And please watch this this this t-bat plays. Let's play. It's very important to understand. No, that's not things
01:07:31 Are gonna make sense even
01:07:33 Even I even I would not
01:07:36 Even I would not expect someone to watch t-bap in order to understand the the context there
01:07:42 All you need to know is that he is a
01:07:44 he is a
01:07:47 All you need to know is that he is a
01:07:49 mlp youtube reviewer
01:07:52 Cartoon
01:07:56 Cartoon avatar in the side of the in the side of the video avatar, that's all you need to know
01:08:01 And you don't you don't actually have to go and like experience it just really it's self-evident everything
01:08:07 I mean
01:08:08 I mean
01:08:10 You can just see it. You can just see it in his face
01:08:13 It's like
01:08:14 He's got that youtuber in the corner of face. He does right? That's me in the corner
01:08:20 That's my mlp sonar ranting about episodes of my little pony. I
01:08:28 I I'm drawing his
01:08:31 Losing my subscribers
01:08:34 I'm drawing his fight basically his final scene
01:08:38 Right now and it's it's making me uncomfortable. It's very uncomfortable to draw, but I have to do it. I think
01:08:45 I don't know. I think I talked about this before. I don't know how people will react. First of all
01:08:50 I don't know if anyone cares. I don't know if anyone reads the comic a few like I know I know that a handful of people do
01:08:56 I don't know if the catch-up
01:08:59 Uh, yeah, I am at least I mean I
01:09:01 So after you drop off after you drop the little animation for what I
01:09:06 I thought at the time was the finale. I was like, oh, well no more
01:09:09 Simon punishment. I guess and I like oh wait still going on, huh?
01:09:14 I called it the finale
01:09:16 Even though I sort of knew at the time that I knew I was going to make the game even then so I don't know why I
01:09:20 Yeah, I and then I thought oh the game must be like the extended and I might be the finale part too, but not really
01:09:28 It's interesting
01:09:29 No, no the game was the game was always going to be the true ending. Um, but uh
01:09:36 I'm drawing
01:09:37 The finale I'm drawing the final scene
01:09:40 And it's very uncomfortable and if anyone cares. I wonder I wonder if they'll
01:09:45 I'm I think on another episode
01:09:47 I said like it might feel very different to a reader than it feels to me a reader might just read something
01:09:55 And just be like oh lol that happened
01:09:58 um, and me I might like feel it differently and I might be like
01:10:03 I don't know. I think it might be different and to me. I'm drawing it and I feel
01:10:08 Discomfort I feel disquieted I feel
01:10:12 I don't I would you I would you being like really
01:10:15 I would even I would even say I would I would even say horrified. I would say I would say silence you feel the platform
01:10:23 You feel like like the libs have come after you they've taken everything away from you
01:10:28 Well, what well what I'm getting at is it's an uncomfortable scene and I wonder if people will dislike it and be like
01:10:36 I don't like the ending because it's uncomfortable
01:10:39 Or I wonder if
01:10:41 Nobody will
01:10:42 Mind I don't know because if someone complained about it
01:10:46 If someone was like wow that ending was was like why did you do why did it end that way?
01:10:51 I would understand why they felt that way and I wouldn't disagree with them
01:10:55 I I would merely tell them
01:10:58 That it's what my heart. I followed my heart. My heart told me to do it
01:11:02 The muse the music it was literally it literally was not my choice
01:11:06 The muses spoke through me and they told me to do that and I and I just had to do it
01:11:10 And it and that's and that's not even an exact. That's not even exaggeration
01:11:15 I'm sort of thinking like is it like a gory like he gets
01:11:19 He's slowly like close up of him falling into a wood chipper and you see in all the glory detail
01:11:25 I'm not going to say what it better not be
01:11:28 No, I can I can neither confirm nor deny that specific
01:11:33 That's specific thing that one there's gonna be some fourth wall
01:11:36 Breaking bullshit where it cuts to Ben St. Drawing the comic and he's like I think I'll just stop or some
01:11:43 deep
01:11:45 That's that would be very uncomfortable. It's a
01:11:50 It's a it's a Stephen King
01:11:53 Dark tower the ending just loops back to the beginning
01:11:58 Infinite I don't want to read this comic again
01:12:02 Yeah, well you have to you just have to keep reading it. You just have to keep reading and reading and replaying and replaying it
01:12:08 That's how bonga luna
01:12:09 That's how bonga luna was supposed to end. It was supposed to just restart back to the beginning loop forever
01:12:15 Is that true? Is it is that no, that's not true. I mean that up. Oh, okay
01:12:20 well
01:12:21 So I guess that's all just to say that I'm curious what people will
01:12:26 Feel about the ending and I guess
01:12:29 For the month I kind of just hope I hope I hope people feel anything at all about it. Even if they're mad
01:12:35 disgusted
01:12:37 Infuriated disappointed
01:12:39 That's all that's all good
01:12:42 That's that's all a net positive if everyone's just like
01:12:46 Oh, whatever. I kind of just didn't even notice. Oh, I didn't even read it
01:12:51 Yeah, that would be that's that's that's the worst-case scenario
01:12:55 Uh me going around being like, hey, hey guys, you read the end of the slime and punishment. What are you? Who?
01:13:00 Slime and what?
01:13:02 Who are you? Why are you talking to me?
01:13:04 This is a this is a school. This is a school zone. You're not allowed within 500 feet. Oh my god. I have this uh
01:13:10 Oh my god. Oh, okay
01:13:13 Is the ending that dark that you're not allowed out of school zone after it's happened?
01:13:17 Yeah, we read the end of slime and punishment and we've decided you're no longer allowed you're no longer allowed within 500 feet of a school
01:13:23 Yeah, and um
01:13:25 Slime and punishment cuts to phantom horn in bed and he's all like and that's my story and it and it's like another pony
01:13:32 It's like one of the one of the toddler ponies is like wow, that's crazy
01:13:36 The end of slime and punishment is a is just phantom horn turning to the camera and and
01:13:42 As speaking as me he delivers a direct apology and a list of people that he that he is that the author has groomed
01:13:52 And he's sorry and he's really sorry though. Give him another chance
01:13:56 Yeah, that's how that's how villain versions two
01:14:00 Oh, we all got to do it. Yeah, we all gotta do it now. You have to do it too. Give that's how punk and aliens
01:14:05 Yeah, yeah, yeah, give you gotta do it. Yeah punk turns to the camera just list off all the people

01:14:21 Um tico all all poodles that live in my neighborhood
01:14:27 So, uh, anyway, uh, that's I guess that's I guess that's all I guess that's all that's that's pretty epic
01:14:35 I think so what I I want to I want to talk to you
01:14:38 Ben and give you could you could participate you could you could be a part in this too
01:14:43 Oh god, I think I mean, I didn't I didn't think I mean I invited you on there. I didn't think we'd have to talk to you

01:16:18 um, but
01:16:19 Yeah, phantom horn. Yeah, exactly
01:16:22 I want the the inferior the inferior brother the dandy de Vito to keg standards. Arnold Schwarzenegger
01:16:27 Where the fuck is keg standard? Where's keg standard? That's what I kept saying every time reading slamming punishment
01:16:33 Like when is keg standard gonna pop in and save the day?
01:16:36 Uh keg standard is in slamming punishment keg standard does in fact make a cameo
01:16:41 I drew that uh, actually, I'll be I'll probably be posting that
01:16:45 in a few days
01:16:47 Yeah
01:16:49 I asked
01:16:50 I asked I thought I thought keg should make a cameo at least once
01:16:55 And so I asked this was this was like this was like a year ago
01:16:58 Which is how fucked up time is
01:17:01 like a year ago
01:17:02 I asked nate
01:17:04 Hey, what would you like?
01:17:05 Do you have any input on like what keg's cameo should be and he did?
01:17:11 and
01:17:12 This is actually pretty funny. He did he was like, hey, what if keg did this and I was like, okay cool
01:17:17 And I didn't I didn't depict it exactly the way he described
01:17:21 but I incorporated the joke that he that he suggested and
01:17:26 I and I posted those pages in my my patron discord channel and
01:17:34 A bunch of people were like
01:17:37 Is this like a like I don't get it like is this a reference to something like what like what it why does he
01:17:43 What is this and I was just like lol nah
01:17:47 Nate just said keg should say that
01:17:50 Because it's funny and everyone was like why is he's saying
01:17:54 It may it was funnier in my opinion. I was like good
01:17:58 uh, there's there's it's
01:18:00 It's good. I think it was I think I think it may at least to me it made it funnier
01:18:04 also keg kegs the kegs the pony
01:18:08 That um that says all the people he groomed right that is that the funny thing Nate wanted you to put
01:18:14 it
01:18:16 I'm not gonna say it's just a little it's just a little weird keg moment
01:18:21 keg moment
01:18:23 Yeah, it's just just it's just a little weird quirky keg moment. That's just a little bit like, huh?
01:18:28 What?
01:18:30 Oh, no, I think I think it was I think it was crack said
01:18:34 Like cracks said someone asked like why is why is keg saying this and I was like, I don't know lol
01:18:40 And Nate Nate said to and and crack was like, oh, I thought you were making fun of him
01:18:46 You're telling me Nate told you to to have this like oh, okay
01:18:52 Uh, I was like, yes base phantom horn beats beats keg to death
01:18:57 And the the whales whales and pain from all the fucking kicks that he's getting
01:19:03 Yeah, he's like, hey, what if keg? Hey, what if can't just beat the shit out of phantom?

01:20:52 So because yeah in previous the last year
01:20:57 I wanted to do it, but like
01:21:00 Uh table space was booked like like immediately
01:21:03 So I missed my opportunity
01:21:05 so I
01:21:06 I wouldn't have even been surprised if I had gone and like it was already too late
01:21:10 Uh, but it's not
01:21:11 um
01:21:13 Okay, anyway, uh
01:21:16 Yeah, so you tabled. What was that? What was the convention?
01:21:18 It was called the rocket con and it was here in san diego and um
01:21:22 It was um it might
01:21:24 This probably this con was not necessarily perfect for comics because
01:21:29 When I first stepped into it and I went into like the bigger halls where they had like the the vendors booths
01:21:34 I realized that wait a second. This is a toy convention
01:21:38 Because it was just nothing but toys
01:21:41 Like toy convention, huh? Like it was all the bigger booths were selling just walls of funko
01:21:47 and everything else was like
01:21:49 Everything else was like the older toys like retro toys or like the the newer stuff that's trying to look like retro toys
01:21:57 Right, which isn't bad. Like no, that's like necessarily bad stuff. But like
01:22:03 Yes, it was mostly for collectors and I should have known that this was going to be the case
01:22:08 Because um this convention was hosted by a local comic book store called
01:22:12 um
01:22:14 TC rockets and actually I don't even know if I want to call them a comic book store because they
01:22:18 They sell comics, but they're in a small like alley section of their of their store
01:22:23 the rest of the store is just nothing but like toys
01:22:26 and a section for uh tabletop games and um
01:22:31 And that was just kind of obvious stepping in because like there was only two people there
01:22:36 selling um independent comics. It was me and uh a guy who was like two booths next to me
01:22:43 Right and it seemed like people were spending people were way more interested in like just getting toys there than um
01:22:49 Getting comics, which makes sense
01:22:52 Right. Yeah, also. Yeah fair enough. Yeah, also
01:22:55 But what was kind of annoying was that the I was in the artist alley with my partner and um
01:23:00 it was
01:23:02 The room for the artist alley was kind of like
01:23:04 It felt almost like conjoined
01:23:07 The the convention didn't really do a good job of like making like
01:23:11 Making the way people walk into the convention seemed natural
01:23:14 because um the entrance of the convention was actually like the exit even though it was like at the front of the of the like
01:23:22 Like um event center and they had to make people like walk around
01:23:27 Right and then our art section of the artist alley was kind of like it was right next to the hall, but you had to like
01:23:34 I don't know like it it doesn't
01:23:36 incentivize you to like walk into the artist alley
01:23:39 You kind of have to go out of your way to get to the artist alley
01:23:42 Right and there was only like a handful. Yeah, there was only a handful of us there
01:23:47 and it was um
01:23:49 I mean, we probably could have sold more if if this convention was more focused on comics
01:23:55 and um, but
01:23:56 I mean that them's them's the beans
01:23:59 But um a couple as they say them's the beans, but um, I I
01:24:05 Fuck I didn't even break even
01:24:07 I sold half of my input. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What do you mean you didn't break even? Okay
01:24:12 So, what was your did it cost money to table? Oh, yeah, I did it cost money. It was like um
01:24:17 Oh, you didn't you didn't you didn't uh, you didn't cover the cost of tabling that sucks. Well
01:24:23 It technically everything I sold was more than like like I did like break even
01:24:29 But then when I started adding the numbers how much money I spent on like merchandise
01:24:34 And um, it it it all kind of just tallyed together and I realized wait, I didn't break even
01:24:40 You know, so it wasn't like it wasn't like I didn't cover table cost
01:24:43 It's just I didn't cover like my merch costs like I didn't sell it
01:24:48 Enough. What do you mean?
01:24:49 What do you mean you didn't okay, but you still got the merch left over. Yeah, I still got merch left over
01:24:55 Okay, so
01:24:57 Yeah, I mean, I guess if the goal if the goal in my head was um, I guess the goal in my head was kind of like to sell everything
01:25:04 Um, I didn't reach get it out there at least that goal. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I sure I printed a bunch of uh
01:25:11 I printed like 60 like villain versus chick tracks
01:25:15 Which cost me like yeah, I have one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna send you more but um, I ran I ran out at the convention
01:25:22 Send me more. Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah. Did you just give those out for free? Yes, and it cost me like
01:25:28 Hmm
01:25:29 It cost me like now that I know the thing about it cost me like 45 bucks to print all those out and it was like 60 of them
01:25:36 Because uh, yeah, yeah, because to print out like 20
01:25:39 Was like 15 bucks
01:25:41 Which doesn't seem too bad, but like when you print out more and more it just it's kind of annoying and originally I
01:25:47 Printed out like half of them through my home printer
01:25:50 but um
01:25:52 But like ink cartridges like cost fucking too much
01:25:54 So I invested in those um, those little like inks ink syringes that you like
01:26:00 Just refill the ink
01:26:02 And it worked. Uh, yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, so those work pretty well
01:26:07 Until like I over like I think I reached the limit of how many times I could inject my like ink into my ink cartridge because it's like
01:26:15 It's like so I've never used those
01:26:17 Yeah, they're they're pretty they're pretty cool. Like, um, they do work
01:26:21 But there's like a limit to how many times you could inject your little cartridge with ink. I heard it's like around like
01:26:27 30 times you could do it
01:26:29 but um
01:26:31 Is that cheaper than buying new cartridges it is cheaper
01:26:34 But like if you don't do it right you could like just fuck up the cartridge and then you have to kind of bite the bullet and buy like
01:26:41 Just just an actual cartridge store. It's so annoying
01:26:45 Um, I wish they brought back those like ink subscriptions that used to have
01:26:49 Well, I think that's and you know what I think there is ink subscriptions, but my printer is like so old they don't do it for
01:26:54 For that like printer anymore
01:26:57 And that's got you. Yep. That's frustrating
01:26:59 But yeah, if you if you tell me the cost of how much it's spent on the merch
01:27:04 Um, the little chick tracks my stickers. I did not
01:27:07 Break even and that was kind of very frustrating
01:27:11 after after the convention because like it felt like
01:27:14 Um, I also did like little like um ink commissions like I would draw like just someone's character in my sketchbook for like
01:27:21 25 bucks and that did pretty well. I got like three of them. There was actually yeah, there was actually this older gentleman who um
01:27:29 Who was going around to every booth that did uh commissions that he would pay for a commission
01:27:35 And um what he specifically wanted he wanted mermaids. He wanted everyone to like draw him a mermaid
01:27:41 Right, but yeah, but the thing is that what he did was that he came up to my booth
01:27:46 And he gave me like a printed picture of a of a like a model in a japanese school
01:27:51 Like a japanese girl school uniform
01:27:54 And she was like tied up like she had um
01:27:57 That those type of like bondage those like rope bondages. You know what i'm talking about
01:28:02 Yeah, you mean like yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, like the the medium
01:28:07 Like the japanese kind of beat us and like rope played thing they do
01:28:12 Um, so we showed you a japanese school girl in rope bondage
01:28:16 It and said draw this as a mermaid. Yes. Yes, exactly
01:28:20 And and it wasn't it wasn't hard because like the way the picture was like her like pose was like, okay
01:28:25 It looks like she's being strung up like on a fish net almost, right?
01:28:29 So all I had to do was just like not draw her legs and just put a mermaid tail under her skirt, right?
01:28:35 And um, yeah
01:28:36 Yeah, and the and the guy like I told him like, okay
01:28:38 I'll have it done in under two hours and he just waited for a while and they told me like, you know what?
01:28:42 I'm gonna be here the next day for the convention. Just give me a then and I'm like, all right
01:28:46 So I finished it. Yeah, he came by the next day
01:28:49 And I showed him the picture like here you go and he's like, okay good
01:28:52 And then he like walked away after he got his picture like he already paid me the day before and everything
01:28:56 And then I see him go to the other booths to get like their commissions
01:29:01 but like
01:29:02 But like I I see that after they he gets his art. He's like still talking to them
01:29:08 Right and I'm like, what is he? What is he telling them?
01:29:12 And then I kind of like eavesdropped a little on like my next door, uh, my neighboring booth
01:29:18 And it sounded like he was giving them like criticism almost
01:29:23 Right. Like like did they not draw the mermaid, right? Did they nice?
01:29:28 Nice alpha alpha move alpha alpha move establish establish expertise
01:29:35 Right because like he just like oh draw this girl as a mermaid. Okay, so I literally just drew the girl as a mermaid
01:29:41 I don't know what these people did
01:29:43 Or or maybe he was really complimented them. Maybe I wasn't hearing correctly. Maybe I did a garbage job
01:29:48 And he didn't want to say anything
01:29:50 You know
01:29:51 Yeah, who knows? Yeah, who knows? Yeah, who knows? I mean I could DM those
01:29:56 neighboring booth people because I do have like their contacts now, but
01:30:00 Yeah, who wants to do all that? Who wants to do all that homework?
01:30:04 You know
01:30:06 Life's too short already right and too difficult and painful life's too short to know if you did a good job
01:30:12 Right, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. It's better. It's better not to know. It's better not to know
01:30:19 He already paid me anyway. I really don't give a fuck
01:30:22 You know how you know how many commissions I have asked that people like
01:30:26 Look at and be like, whoa, this is great. Thanks. And I'm like, oh, you're welcome. You're welcome gamer
01:30:32 some people
01:30:33 some some people are
01:30:36 it's just more
01:30:38 Some people have very specific
01:30:40 Tastes and some people are just happy to see their
01:30:44 To see whatever it is. He yeah, he didn't draw their mermaid tail fishy enough. It's like this looks more like a manateed
01:30:51 Tail
01:30:55 Exactly
01:30:56 Um, another funny thing is that the other
01:31:00 So the other guy who was selling his own independent comic was like to boost down from mine
01:31:05 And I I over here and this guy like during the whole weekend was just like
01:31:09 Um, I I kept rehearing his elevator pitch for his comic
01:31:13 Like over and over again because he was telling everybody and I mean I was doing that too, right with my comic
01:31:18 When like people came by right?
01:31:20 But um, but the first time I hear this guy's like pitch
01:31:24 He was like basically like so in my story all the characters are immortal and then I'm like, oh, that sounds kind of familiar
01:31:31 And then and then he's uh, and then he said like and there's also no heroes in my story and it's and I'm like wait a second
01:31:38 Wait a second
01:31:39 I'm thinking like is he describing villain versus these people. Is this is crook? Uh, you know crook
01:31:47 Crook crook crook crook dimension crook. Uh, yeah the crook cronies the crook company
01:31:54 Is but um
01:31:57 But no, he was just describing his own because then after that he's all like also in this universe. No one like
01:32:02 Uh regenerates back their organs if they're like, um rip the part or something
01:32:07 And it's like, okay
01:32:08 He's describing something completely different because that doesn't happen in my story
01:32:12 And he he had a his comic is called like a mortal era
01:32:17 And it was like about yeah, it was about like some sort of like thing happens where everyone becomes immortal
01:32:23 But it's kind of like the immortality where so it's so it's 17
01:32:27 776
01:32:29 The best comic ever made right but this looks more like
01:32:33 um
01:32:34 It seems like this guy's goal is to kind of like get some sort of netflix deal or something because this feels like something that would
01:32:40 Oh good. Well good luck, buddy
01:32:43 Okay, this seems like something that would eventually become like a netflix deal or something and apparently
01:32:48 One of his first artists he did the issue with because this guy isn't the artist
01:32:51 He's just the writer and he he pays like several people to draw the comic
01:32:55 and they and they have that kind of like, um
01:32:58 I don't want to call it like the the marvel or dc house style, but like it's a very like
01:33:04 Um, they they wanted to look as realistic as paul you ever like seen those comics that like wanted to look really like super realistic and it's um
01:33:12 And it's almost like
01:33:15 These could be like celebrities playing these characters almost, you know
01:33:19 There's a lot of yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine
01:33:22 Yeah, there's like a lot of comics in the wild that are like comics that were like intended to be pitches for shows, you know
01:33:29 And this this kind of yeah, this kind of feels like it
01:33:32 um
01:33:33 Hmm the the guy seemed cool
01:33:35 I was I was talking to him but um his comic wasn't something I was super interested in he didn't sound super interested in villain verse
01:33:40 So I guess the feeling was like mutual so
01:33:45 Yeah, that's fair. I guess
01:33:47 um, hmm
01:33:49 uh
01:33:51 If you hmm
01:33:53 I mean, I you know, I mean, I'm never I was thinking about this
01:33:58 I've I've I've never made anything with an eye to like, oh, maybe someone will adapt it. Oh, maybe someone will pick this up
01:34:04 I've I've never even thought about it in my life
01:34:07 uh
01:34:09 Is that like, I don't know. I mean some some some how I I mean I I managed to
01:34:15 I I guess I would call my comics have been
01:34:19 profitable more or less. I mean I not like your comics are anti-netflix if you will
01:34:24 Oh, I mean, I I had like uh dreams of like, oh if I make if I write down an idea for a video game then
01:34:32 Then nintendo or sony I I could go to them and they would make it because like
01:34:37 You know, I'm yeah, I had I had those ideas
01:34:40 Give them a give them a shot. Yeah
01:34:42 Give them a show just make a video game. It's a pretty good idea actually five-year-old
01:34:47 Oh, me me me a me a monosan. It'll it'll cost us 900 million dollars to develop this game. Oh
01:34:54 You you've forgotten the joy of childhood. Look at this. This child is innocent
01:35:00 from the minds of babes
01:35:03 A bad video game is forever a rushed video game is forever bad make it
01:35:08 Do it it watch us on it's like that bangs gavel
01:35:12 It's like that episode of uh, it's like the episode of the simpsons where like mel Gibson hires homer to write his next film
01:35:19 Is that a real episode? Yeah
01:35:22 I yeah, yeah, it's mel Gibson
01:35:24 I forget why because mel Gibson like is like tired of his successful like movie franchise
01:35:30 And he's all like I can't believe he's like really does everyone like this and then he finds homers
01:35:34 The sole person who doesn't like this franchise and he and he hires homer to like
01:35:39 re kind of like
01:35:41 rewrite the whole
01:35:42 The whole kind of like a movie
01:35:44 It's the one episode that ends with like the dog the dog that's looking like sideways like kind of like dog with a shift
01:35:50 Yeah, that was shift the eyes. Yeah, you remember that wait
01:35:53 That's the episode with the with the shift the eyed dog because that was homer's idea. He said like at the end of the movie
01:35:59 I don't remember that. I remember the dog. I don't remember that episode at all
01:36:04 I don't remember that plot even a little bit because they they go to hollywood. I think yeah takes place
01:36:09 All I guess mel Gibson like hires homer
01:36:11 They go to hollywood and homers don't want to says like and the villain at the end of the movie
01:36:15 The real villain is going to be revealed as this dog who's going to look very shifty looking back and forth
01:36:20 And that's how the audience is going to know they're the bad guy
01:36:23 Uh
01:36:24 And then they shoot it down, but then there's a real then at the end of the episode. Yeah, the real shifty eye dog shows up
01:36:31 Yeah, I only remember that gag
01:36:34 I remember the
01:36:35 Gag that I liked from that. I don't know why I like it so much
01:36:39 It's like mel Gibson comes to the simpsons house
01:36:42 It rings the doorbell. He opens it. He says, hey, you're homer simpson
01:36:45 I need you to come to the thing and homer says. Oh, you had me at hello
01:36:51 And mel gibbons says I didn't say
01:36:54 Yeah, because he didn't yeah, and I just like
01:36:57 I don't know. Oh, yeah. Yeah, why that stuck with me. Hey, uh, that's great. That's great
01:37:02 Oh, so anyway, good. That's a good joke
01:37:05 Always simpsons always gets me a chuckle always gets me a laugh a gaffa out of me
01:37:12 um
01:37:13 I wanted to ask ask you ben um
01:37:16 How do you feel about uh, if
01:37:19 Because um what I'm gonna do in my because I got two more conventions lined up because I like doing
01:37:24 Inventions for the these next conventions. I'm gonna make sure I break even and not like
01:37:28 Spend a crazy amount of money
01:37:31 um, yeah
01:37:32 But how would you love do you want to do like
01:37:35 A trade ben where um
01:37:37 If I send you some copies of villain versus you send me copies of vapor
01:37:40 I will sell them at my booth and I'll give you a percentage
01:37:46 Do you think that's something to be interested in?
01:37:50 No
01:37:55 No, no, no, not really not not really. I'm not gonna sell villain versus
01:38:02 You're not gonna sell you don't think you can sell villain versus. You don't think you'll be like, yeah
01:38:05 There's a bunch of kooky little space aliens
01:38:08 uh
01:38:10 I don't even have a con that I'm like planning on going to anytime soon
01:38:14 Is is cons is conning something that you so you're not super interested in conning and going to no, I am
01:38:21 No, I am it's just uh, there aren't
01:38:24 Like the only one that I'm aware of around here is mice and uh, that one is not scheduled yet
01:38:32 Uh, I don't know. I'm out of I'm out of I'm out of vapor's one. I need to reprint vapor's one
01:38:38 I have no copies of it left or have like two copies of it left
01:38:42 um
01:38:43 and um
01:38:45 Yeah, I don't know. I just I think if I'm tabling
01:38:48 I'm gonna sell my own stuff like I I got I got 30 seconds
01:38:52 I got I got seconds to pitch to someone who's wandering by my table, right and they're like
01:38:58 here
01:38:59 What what do you got and I'm gonna tell them like here's my comic
01:39:03 I don't have time. I don't have time to be like, oh and here's this other comic by some other guy
01:39:08 And let me tell you about that, right?
01:39:10 I mean my thing is that if I have like a variety of comics that kind of incentivizes people to like
01:39:17 Stay a bit longer, right? And also
01:39:20 Like I like the idea that like, oh, there's cop. There's being there's copies of Villainverse being sold in other parts of this country
01:39:27 Right. I do have I have a I have a friend who like lives in
01:39:32 I think um in mass chusas also, um another another person who I talked about this and they said they're down
01:39:39 They're gonna send me a couple copies of their they're just gonna send me like three and I'm gonna sell them three and it's like, okay, like, you know
01:39:46 You don't have to like you don't have to like push this on people but it's like
01:39:50 If people ask about it
01:39:52 You know, you know what, you know what, you know what if uh
01:39:55 Look, it's up to you. It's up. It's up to you. Like you don't gotta say yes
01:39:59 Is there something I wouldn't want to worry about I wouldn't want to worry about like a percentage or anything
01:40:04 If we just do just trade we just trade copies, right?
01:40:08 Uh, you know, I mean
01:40:11 I guess if I was gonna table like I gotta fill table space with something right
01:40:16 Uh, yeah, you know, I mean there's um when it may you know what maybe when I reprint when I reprint vapors one
01:40:23 Yeah, yeah, maybe I could maybe I could just also give you like I don't know like
01:40:28 10 copies of each I guess or something and then 10 might you give me 10 might be too much
01:40:34 You give me like five copies of each
01:40:37 Okay, I mean yeah
01:40:39 What what what I do what what I gonna do is just send out like issues once and then in the back
01:40:45 It just tells you how to get an issue too
01:40:47 because um
01:40:49 That that's kind of something I learned from other people
01:40:52 Like who are kind of smaller is that they don't really like
01:40:55 Do the other issues?
01:40:57 um
01:40:58 Yeah, because then it's kind of harder to sell the other like if you do like a bunch of like if you
01:41:03 If you print out like a bunch of issue too
01:41:06 But like no one really has an idea of like issue one. Yeah, right? So I mean sometimes like like I
01:41:12 I do have a bunch of spare issues to Streets and Fours and I'm thinking like
01:41:16 For the next time I'm gonna find a better way to display all those
01:41:20 So you sell issue one and then in issue issue one, there's like ordering information for the other issues right in the back
01:41:26 Yeah, got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I need to make sense. I yeah, I need to update mine because it says that oh
01:41:32 You get them off gumroad and I'm actually took them off of gumroad recently
01:41:37 Uh, I think well after I after I put uh after I restock
01:41:44 I think I'll put uh vapers one and vapers two just up on my my store page
01:41:49 Like I'll probably maybe I'll sell them for like 20 bucks
01:41:52 Maybe I'll sell them for like 20 bucks on the store page and then like they're 15 if you get them through
01:41:56 A Kickstarter or something
01:41:59 Uh
01:42:02 Or I don't know. I'm not sure
01:42:04 I'm not sure if there would be any
01:42:06 I mean, maybe once in a maybe once in a while. Maybe like once a month. I could see somebody some random person being like, hey
01:42:14 I'll buy one
01:42:16 Okay, I like, you know people buy
01:42:19 the the the the
01:42:20 People buy during a Kickstarter because it's like, oh, this is an event like this is this is a thing
01:42:24 This is this is a one-time thing. It's happening right now. I have to buy this comic right now
01:42:30 Right. I feel like even if I did list them on my store page
01:42:34 I don't think it would vastly increase
01:42:37 Sales or anything, but I probably should do it anyway. Why not?
01:42:40 What's what's the downside? You know, um, if if like sending comics doesn't sound super interesting to you you could like, um
01:42:47 One of my buddies I got a friend of mine. His name is nick
01:42:50 Um, I forget I forget his twitter handle, but I'll look it up right now and tell you guys
01:42:54 But um, he made these little postcards for villain verse and he gives them out at his booth
01:43:00 And it's like like the like check it out looking at them
01:43:04 Little postcards. Yeah, there's little postcards. So it has like the cover
01:43:08 This is a new cover that I read. I drew a new cover for the prologue
01:43:12 And in the back it has the the the chick track comic
01:43:16 So you just give these out to people, you know
01:43:20 Yeah
01:43:21 I don't know. I guess I'm
01:43:24 When you're sitting there when you're sitting there at your little booth or whatever
01:43:29 People at least this was my experience at mice and I feel like it's
01:43:34 What I feel like I've seen it happen at other cons too
01:43:37 Like people are there and they're asking you about your comic, right? Yeah. Yeah
01:43:43 Yeah, they want to know
01:43:45 about that
01:43:47 uh, and like that's
01:43:48 Mainly what I want to be talking about is like I want to tell them what I do and what I'm doing here
01:43:52 Because if they're here to talk to me about my stuff
01:43:55 I'm gonna pitch I'm gonna I'm gonna pitch him on my stuff. No, I got you. You know what I mean? I got you
01:43:59 Yeah, that's my buddy, uh, Nick's art corner. Um, he's the guy who made these postcards. He's pretty cool to check out his comic
01:44:07 as well
01:44:08 But uh, it looks he's art looks pretty good, right?
01:44:11 but um
01:44:12 What I was gonna say is that the strategy that like I I saw was kind of like
01:44:17 I was kind of doing like a car salesman strategy
01:44:21 Almost or like you ever been to like a shopping center and they have those little kiosks boost
01:44:27 Booth where it's like a guy like and he has that like
01:44:30 Product that cleans your shoes and when he sees you looking at his booth
01:44:34 He calls you over to come to him. You don't want to talk about this is a very specific thing
01:44:39 Uh, and then he and then he accidentally like drops a bunch of like
01:44:43 A bunch of like diarrhea on your shoes and he's like, oh, let me get that out for you, sir
01:44:47 I have just the thing basically that's kind of what I was doing because at first um
01:44:52 To kind of attract people to my booth was if anyone walked by I told them like here. Here's the chick track. It's free
01:44:56 Right, and I just give I give everyone a chick track and I ran out of chick tracks like the first day
01:45:01 Which was kind of dumb what I should have done was um
01:45:04 If people ask if I had a business card, I should have just given the chick track
01:45:08 Because that's kind of a little more memorable is to get a little comic than like a business card
01:45:12 um, I was
01:45:14 Because I was at uh, I was at uh
01:45:17 anthra new england last weekend and
01:45:19 Yeah, one thing that I thought of was like I should make business cards or I should make something
01:45:24 Uh like that
01:45:26 um
01:45:28 Yeah, it's it's helpful might not be might not might not be black. I think a black business
01:45:32 Might be black like my soul. You see much much like my soul much much like that in a similar
01:45:38 Yeah, um the second day everyone kept asking me for business cards, but I ran out of like the chick track
01:45:43 so what I did was I just kind of like
01:45:46 I um, I just took like one of my I took my lint my luna sticker inventory
01:45:50 And I just wrote my my handle on the back and I wrote villain verse and I just gave it out to anyone who asked for like a business card
01:45:56 um, yeah
01:45:58 but um
01:45:59 But people um what I noticed what I did was that um
01:46:03 I would kind of just use like uh like free stuff to entice people to come to my booth like my friend nick
01:46:08 Also gave me some postcards for his comic and I would give those out. I'd be like hey man
01:46:12 I'd be anyone's walking by like walking by be like hey, man. Uh here this is free
01:46:17 Right and and I'm like this is my buddy's comic. You should check it out
01:46:19 That's like all I say about the postcard and then after I say that I say like and this is my comic and I pull out the villain verse
01:46:25 That's on display and I tell them to like you know flip you can flip through that if you want to check check it out, right?
01:46:30 Uh, you got it. You got a sucker. You got a sucker punch him right exactly
01:46:33 So I I pulled them in and I just gave them the quick I gave them the quick uh like just elevator pitch of how it goes
01:46:40 Um, I point out things in the comic like in the pro level like yeah
01:46:43 This guy right here this guy's like evilest guy in the universe
01:46:46 He's so evil the devil shows up to fight him in the prologue
01:46:49 And
01:46:50 Yeah, yeah, that's the kind of thing you want you want people to be like it
01:46:54 And that's also kind of like how you can tell if they sound interested in it
01:46:58 Because like if you say like oh, yeah, the devil shows up and they're like what?
01:47:02 What?
01:47:03 No way not not not old bls above right exactly, but if they don't that old scratch himself
01:47:10 If they if they don't say anything during that part you they're not interested
01:47:16 If you yeah, so so so depending on their reaction if they sound interested
01:47:20 I keep going and like and I try to sell it more on the book
01:47:23 But if they sound uninterested I just kind of cut the pitch short and just say like
01:47:28 I I go I go to my other things a lot of people kind of just like supporting local artists, right?
01:47:32 So you got to mention like yeah, yeah, you got to mention like that you make the you made the book all by yourself
01:47:39 And that's your local that's your local artist because people just like
01:47:43 They might not like really dig the story, but they might like the idea of just supporting local artists, right?
01:47:47 and um, I think a bunch of people that bought books for me at mice were just like
01:47:53 They were kind of yeah, they were kind of just there to buy everything they were kind of just there to
01:47:58 Support everybody there just whatever anyone's got like yeah, I'll take one. I'll check it out later. Maybe but like I'm here to
01:48:05 I'm here to spread money around and the
01:48:08 local indie scene
01:48:10 Yeah, that's that's that's epic. That's that's epic of them
01:48:14 Um, I also thought of another strategy that was kind of too late to do because I already had my price on my on my shelf
01:48:20 How much everything cost but um my strategy was to
01:48:25 I said I'm selling the book for 17 bucks, but um
01:48:29 Yeah, I mean it's it's a it's a hefty
01:48:32 It's a hefty ish book, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's like 42 pages
01:48:35 But but what I should have done was sold the book for 20 bucks and as I'm going for the elevator pitch
01:48:42 I tell them like, you know what dude? I'm down to sell this to you for 17 bucks like you don't gotta pay the 20
01:48:48 To make it seem like they're getting a deal right do the do the car the car salesman singing dance, right?
01:48:54 Yeah, I mean, why not? It's a it's a nice little uh, I think probably some people
01:49:01 I think probably some there might be a few people who'd be like, uh, well if it's oh, he's giving me a discount. Ah, well
01:49:08 Right, exactly. Yeah
01:49:10 I guess I guess I can't
01:49:13 I can't not I can't not do I think you know, I think I sold
01:49:17 I think if I remember correctly at mini mice I sold my books for less
01:49:21 I think I was selling them for 10
01:49:24 Each, uh, which is less than than I was selling them for in Kickstarter. Right, uh, which is okay
01:49:30 I mean, they were it's still a profit, but like
01:49:34 Yeah, I sold them for I sold them for cheap. I sold them for cheap there
01:49:37 Uh, just just because I wanted people to buy them just so that I wanted to move
01:49:41 Um product and I get and I guess it worked more or less another thing
01:49:47 that like
01:49:48 Should have been kind of obvious
01:49:51 From the get-go like this is the most obvious thing ever
01:49:55 When it comes to like selling at a convention
01:49:58 Is that people are attracted to the things they already like, you know, so
01:50:03 Um, for example, there was a guy next to us
01:50:07 Who who does this kind of like?
01:50:10 um
01:50:11 He does like
01:50:12 He he draw he recreates like images of characters from like video games or anime
01:50:19 But he uses like an ink brush to to do the art, right?
01:50:23 And it's literally just like it literally just looks like he printed out these images
01:50:30 And he just like just clicked on the ink brush filter on like photoshop or something
01:50:36 But he sells like he sells these like huge like look, I'm gonna I'll show you a picture of this guy
01:50:41 But he was like right next to us and I don't even know if I want to call it like uh
01:50:44 I don't even know if I want to call it like an art style
01:50:47 It's more like an art filter that this guy is doing these like pieces with because look at that
01:50:52 That just looks like the that just looks like the official art, but he just recreated in ink brushes, right?
01:50:59 He doesn't like with physical ink. Well, I think he says he does
01:51:05 I I didn't really talk. I didn't really talk to him because I wasn't like
01:51:08 I was on the other side of the table and I wasn't that close like next to him
01:51:13 But it just looks like it looks like official art, but he just
01:51:17 Ink brushed. Yeah, right
01:51:19 If he's doing it with like it doesn't look very difficult to do something like this
01:51:23 Yeah, I
01:51:26 I guess if he's doing it with like physical ink
01:51:29 On like parchment or something. I guess I can appreciate why someone would buy it because it's like, oh, yeah
01:51:34 It's this image, but it's like in a in a in a new meat. It's been transferred to a new medium. It's a physical piece
01:51:41 Whatever if he's just doing this with like with like photo filters or whatever then like
01:51:46 I guess I could under I guess I could still understand someone buying it
01:51:50 But I I'm pretty sure like this is what I think he does like he I think he probably
01:51:57 I think he on prints out the image and he paints over it because that's what it looks like it just looks like he's like
01:52:04 If he's physically print if he's physically like using actual ink and like actually brushing it on to the canvas then I
01:52:11 I respect the
01:52:13 I respect the yet. He's like crafting something
01:52:17 Right and like and I was thinking like this is like so like this is like so basic, you know
01:52:22 This is like so like normie core, you know, it's like the average
01:52:25 Yeah, the average nerd, right? But then I saw I mean, that's how you sell shit, right? And I'd be in
01:52:30 Yeah, and then I saw him like have a picture of devil man and I was like, oh, it looks pretty badass
01:52:35 And I was like dammit. He got me. He got me
01:52:39 Because like he just froze out this like wide net of like just
01:52:43 Everything that people likes and he probably does gang clusters
01:52:47 His his booth was like super popular. I could see it. I could see it selling. Yeah
01:52:52 It's definitely the sort of thing. This is this is the kind of thing that really bores doing it myself
01:52:57 but like it's
01:52:58 Yeah, uh, specifically what he's doing is just like tracing or like copying
01:53:03 existing art
01:53:04 I would like
01:53:06 I would prefer to draw it myself
01:53:08 If I'm going to draw a bunch of popular characters, but like even that
01:53:12 Is like, uh, but I want to draw my thing though
01:53:15 This is time I could spend doing my thing and then I nobody pays. I mean like I was like, uh, I guess because if I were to like
01:53:21 Buy a piece of art like if someone like um if ben saint drew popular character mario
01:53:27 I want I want that ben saint kind of like flavor because that's why I would come to ben saint to draw like mario
01:53:33 Right, I wouldn't want to just draw like here's the brawl render and I just drew over it
01:53:38 right
01:53:40 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah. I mean I I agree. Well, I agree
01:53:45 but uh, you know
01:53:47 That's not like nothing against this guy like nothing against this guy. He he probably
01:53:52 Potentially, I'm pretty sure makes more money than me doing this
01:53:56 I think I think that that's a different
01:53:59 What you're describing is a different kind of thing. These are not like
01:54:03 This is not a commission. This is a this is a
01:54:07 This is a print, but it's got a sort of a different
01:54:10 I don't know. It's got you got the ink brush filter and people people love that a different medium
01:54:15 It looks edgy. It looks cool. You know, you put that on get it
01:54:18 Yeah, I mean nintendo wouldn't be selling like a mario that looks like that
01:54:23 And if you wanted that on your wall, where else are you gonna? Yeah, I want him to do exactly if he did joker
01:54:29 I'd put that on my wall
01:54:32 You got heat. You got heath ledger's joker. Yeah, I got
01:54:36 I want to get Joaquin Phoenix joker on the wall. Joaquin Phoenix joker
01:54:40 Who would win in a fight Joaquin Phoenix joker or Heath Ledger joker?
01:54:45 Yeah, I know I already I knew the answer as I was asking it, but I had to finish the question
01:54:50 um
01:54:52 What I was gonna see yeah
01:54:54 Yeah, what I was gonna say is that like you need like you unironically need something like this at your booth
01:54:59 You want to draw attention?
01:55:01 Because I saw a bunch of other people doing it too where they have like little prints of like
01:55:05 Just like popular characters that like people like right
01:55:09 And you would sell those right or you were just enticed people with those like yeah, here's my
01:55:14 Here's the stuff based on popular franchise, but here's like my original stuff, you know
01:55:19 I saw a tweet this week
01:55:22 It was a screenshot of a tumblr post. It was two posts by the same guy and and i'm gonna try to remember and paraphrase it
01:55:28 it was like
01:55:30 It was something like
01:55:31 I know this guy who
01:55:34 Always gets girls. He's always getting girls to come to come to his house to come over to his house
01:55:40 by say by saying by saying
01:55:44 Oh, can't oh, I'm so glad I have stew at home like mm. Can't wait to go home and eat some of that stew
01:55:52 and then
01:55:53 And the worst part is
01:55:55 And the yeah, and the worst part is I was um when I'm I'm there at his house and I'm eating stew and I'm like damn
01:56:00 It worked on me too
01:56:03 So this this this these ink prints are this guy's stew, you know, everybody everybody loves stew
01:56:08 Why wouldn't you why wouldn't you want to have some stew? He's the stew maker. He's the stew artist
01:56:13 Exactly, right right instead of calling himself shame
01:56:17 Shane sarr
01:56:20 He should call himself stew art
01:56:22 It's like that's like the name of this guy's like uh stuff
01:56:26 Yeah, yeah, yeah
01:56:28 So I think well, I'm glad glad he's working. Yeah, he's fill it. He's filling it. He's filling the demand
01:56:33 I guess yeah, I think for my next convention. I'm gonna try to like I have this like little sketchbook
01:56:38 And I think I'm just gonna just fill it up with like
01:56:41 drawings of characters popular characters people like
01:56:45 I mean, I like a lot of popular characters. So I that was just throwing a couple of throwing like a lot of people I like
01:56:51 In that I drew Gino once I drew Gino once I should make prints of that one time. I drew Gino does it does it look good
01:56:58 Yeah, it was pretty good. Oh, can I see it? Where is it? Where can I see it?
01:57:03 Oh god, uh, if you let's see, uh, if you search twitter, let me try and find it on twitter
01:57:09 It's all so ugly
01:57:12 Gino

01:57:37 I think yeah, I think this is pretty good
01:57:39 I think the piggies will slop this up if you make pictures of it. They will
01:57:43 They would eat this up. They'll be like Gino
01:57:45 And I want and I want their slop. I want them to slop all over me

01:59:35 Um, yeah
01:59:37 So, um, also at this convention. There was this a rubin s gentleman dressed up like a frappy from my hero academia
01:59:44 You know the the fraud girl
01:59:47 Yeah, yeah, so he was dressed up like like her and this guy like he came by my booth and we talked
01:59:52 And he gave me this sticker that he made
01:59:55 Of this this guy is like the antagonist of his like comic, but he never told me where to find his comic
02:00:01 So if anyone knows like I love this sticker, by the way
02:00:07 This reminds me of I don't know remember one time, um
02:00:12 I think I talked about it on one one episode
02:00:14 So I wouldn't blame me if you didn't know what i'm talking about but crack gave me a like
02:00:19 scrawled
02:00:20 drawing on like a piece of brown paper bag
02:00:24 That he got from like a
02:00:26 Artist's convention for like mentally challenged people or something like outsider artists with like who were like from like an
02:00:34 They're like institutionalized
02:00:36 Oh, some guy drew his like edgy sona his edgy like shadow the hedgehog guy
02:00:42 Complaining about some dude. He knew who who didn't bail him out of jail one time
02:00:47 Yeah, that that's what this this looks like that sounds like art right that that sounds so fucking cool
02:00:52 I should like it was so cool. I should it is I have it here in my
02:00:57 Well, it's not hanging up. I should hang it up. I don't know why I didn't hang it up
02:01:00 It's on my shelf. I should commission like some x con to draw like a cover for villain verse because it'd be kind of cool
02:01:06 Like oh at x con cover
02:01:09 right
02:01:10 Yeah
02:01:12 Yeah, that's an angle. Yeah, that's a gimmick. I need um
02:01:16 But I think I was I need to like make my booth kind of stand out a little bit more
02:01:19 Um, I all the other booths had like this whole giant like there there was a booth next to us
02:01:24 that had this whole like
02:01:26 these these rates had these like
02:01:28 Metal grates around their like booth with all their like images like it was like um display images for all the prints they sell
02:01:36 Right and like that's like easy and identifiable. Like if you see it across the room
02:01:40 You see your favorite anime character, right?
02:01:43 And I and and the thing is like I don't necessarily draw popular stuff
02:01:47 I always want to push my original stuff, right? But yeah, but if you had like
02:01:54 Let's say you're um, let's say the stuff you made had like a popular character on it
02:01:59 And if you could find a way to kind of display it
02:02:01 Out there that could attract like like people, you know
02:02:06 um
02:02:07 You know what you should have you should like 3d print or otherwise try to find a way to like create that
02:02:13 Golden skull medallion necklace thing. Oh, yeah. Oh, actually
02:02:18 At the 99 cent store, um, there was like a plastic like
02:02:24 Skull like chain that was like a skull with the crossbones like that looked very similar to that
02:02:29 And I was like, oh, I should buy this and like use like gold spray paint
02:02:34 To like make it and then like make a bunch of fake jewels and put it on it, you know
02:02:38 Because that'd be pretty fucking good
02:02:40 A guy who was selling video games
02:02:44 At uh, anthra new england from whom I purchased did I meant
02:02:48 Did I say what I bought a copy of well neither of you guys were on last episode?
02:02:52 So you don't know what uh, yeah, I purchased a copy of bart's nightmare for the super nintendo
02:02:58 Uh for 30 dollars, which is a reasonable price
02:03:01 Uh, I
02:03:03 I looked on amazon to make sure that I wasn't being ripped off
02:03:07 Uh, it was not
02:03:10 Bought a copy of bart's nightmare. He had uh, anyway, he had uh, he had 3d printed uh stuff there. He was selling some 3d printed
02:03:18 Pokemon stuff. He had 3d printed cubone skulls. He had 3d printed porygons shiny and non shiny
02:03:25 He had a couple of different things. I forget there were more there wasn't all pokemon
02:03:29 But yeah, he just had a bunch of junk that he 3d printed it. It's like hell
02:03:34 Hell yeah
02:03:36 For the for the porygon it worked perfectly like it looked digital and like
02:03:40 Yeah, looks like a porygon
02:03:43 That's that's pretty bad for the didn't look bad for the cubone skull either. It was it. I was like damn
02:03:49 Look at all this shit
02:03:51 It looks neat looks kind of neat actually
02:03:54 I'm thinking about um getting one of those big like cardboard like you know how people could just print anything on a cardboard stand
02:04:01 Right
02:04:02 Yeah, like we did with uh, gino at uh
02:04:06 At the rad con for rad con four. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I was thinking I was trying to think which number it was
02:04:11 I want to like do this into a 3d stand and put it uh to put it on my boof
02:04:17 But looking at this image right now
02:04:23 Yeah, what will we have on the paper? Oh villain verse
02:04:28 Read read villain verse. No, I cut it out
02:04:30 So I can make it a stand that he's like holding villain verse copies so people can just like grab them and check them out
02:04:35 Right, that would work really well actually. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's that's really funny. That's really funny
02:04:41 Um, I might just I might just recreate it. Maybe make it everybody would be talking
02:04:47 Everybody would be talking about did you see the Kanye boof? Did you see that guy with the Kanye standee?
02:04:52 Yeah, I'm thinking I might get like maybe negative attention if I use just Kanye there
02:05:01 But um, uh, isn't isn't this like a meme? I think it'll
02:05:06 Meme value, right? It's still it's still black. It's still black history month. So you can still use them after that
02:05:11 You're not allowed. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. But um, I'm thinking maybe like, um
02:05:15 Boss of the clown and like it's it is like a little stand where I put my comics
02:05:20 Because um, hopefully by the next convention that I'm doing which is gonna be like in april
02:05:26 um, there is another comic I want to like
02:05:29 Make because I think it might get like
02:05:31 A lot of eyes on me. That's kind of like a meme, you know, like I'm thinking like
02:05:36 um, I need to do my own like
02:05:39 Mr. Boo eyes on me final fantasy 8
02:05:42 If I if I were gonna talk about the Kanye song eyes on me
02:05:45 No, which is final fantasy final fantasy 8. That's yeah
02:05:50 That's the song that plays when they're in space and they have the romantic
02:05:55 See squall they save someone save someone from dying in space
02:05:59 And then they're like, oh now we're in a spaceship. Oh, we were gonna die. We didn't die
02:06:04 And they sing a little song. Okay. Okay, shut up. Okay. There is shut up
02:06:08 Shut up and keep talking. There isn't a Kanye song called all eyes on me. There's a song called all eyes on yay
02:06:15 Which is what he calls himself now, but um, totally. I know I'm trying to make my own mr
02:06:20 My own mr. Boop my own tails gets trolled
02:06:24 Right. Oh god, which is basically. Yeah, basically just like oh get pre-existing characters and they're doing something hilarious guys. Oh
02:06:32 Yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, I guess it's I guess it's a tried and true formula, right
02:06:37 But oh, it's your own scoob and shag my own scoob and shag. Uh, check out. Yeah
02:06:41 Check out my new podcast main character syndrome where we talk about scoob and shag for like
02:06:47 Five minutes, even though that's like the title of the podcast is scoob and shag sucks
02:06:51 Um, is that a real is that a real pod? Yeah. Yeah, I mean character syndrome. Yeah main character syndrome. That's my new my new podcast
02:06:59 Is it on it's on the cheesy manfredo channel
02:07:03 Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So so
02:07:07 Check it out. Um, first episode I got tectonic improv and a king protus
02:07:13 Remember those guys. Yeah. Yeah. This guy's pretty cool. This guy's pretty baller
02:07:17 Those guys are pretty they're pretty quirked up white boys with a little bit of swag both of them. Yeah
02:07:25 But um, what are you saying is yeah, I'm gonna I've told other people about this
02:07:29 But what I want to do is I want to do
02:07:32 a comic book adaptation
02:07:35 Of the opera of paglacci, right?
02:07:39 But I want to replace all the characters with a ronald mcdonald the characters
02:07:45 Because I think I think that would be pretty stubborn
02:07:48 And I don't know the story of paliachi. Oh, well, you know, um, you seen like all the parodies, right?
02:07:53 Where it's like a clown like doing opera, right?
02:07:57 Sure
02:07:59 Yeah, the paglacci story is very simple. It's very short and there's only two acts and it all happens in a span of a day
02:08:05 Um, but basically this this clown this clown
02:08:09 gets cucked
02:08:11 This this actually happens. He gets cucked, of course
02:08:14 And then um, and then the second act becomes like a this meta this meta kind of thing about him getting cucked
02:08:21 And it ends in tragedy. So he gets cucked the whole time
02:08:26 He he finds out he's been getting cucked
02:08:30 Oh
02:08:31 Yeah, he finds out he's been getting cucked and then after he finds out he's been getting cucked
02:08:36 He sings that iconic opera song
02:08:38 That that's all about like the song is basically like, oh, you got it. You got to laugh paglacci
02:08:43 You got to laugh because the show has to go on even though you're sad even though your heart is broken
02:08:46 You got to laugh inside my heart is breaking
02:08:50 My makeup may be flaking, but my smile
02:08:55 Still stays on right on ironically
02:08:57 Of course, unironically. Yes. That is what that song is
02:09:02 and um
02:09:03 And because like the thing is that he's like a he's like a he has a comedy troupe and they go from town to town
02:09:08 And he's considered like the king of the clowns, right?
02:09:11 and um
02:09:12 And he comes into this this town and like everyone's happy and but then he finds out that his like his um,
02:09:17 Bright to be is actually has a secret lover in this town, right?
02:09:21 Right. Yeah, and then he goes to the doctor and he says doctor. I'm depressed and the doctor says
02:09:26 Hey, polyaches in town. Hey, that that scene doesn't I actually don't know where that's from that scene is not famous
02:09:34 Famous scene from the opera like doctor
02:09:37 doctor, I'm depressed, uh
02:09:40 This might cheer you up. There's like webcom. They call the villain verse. Um, it's pretty funny doctor
02:09:45 I am
02:09:47 No, but but but doctor. I fucking hate
02:09:51 The villain verse
02:09:53 Sucks
02:10:01 No, no twist no twist like but doctor that webcomic blows. Oh, sorry. Well, no, no joke doctor
02:10:09 But I rather read slime in punishment. They read villain verse
02:10:12 Oh god, no
02:10:15 But um, yeah, so the second after he finds out he gets cooked and he sings the the iconic song
02:10:21 Um, the second act is like his comedy troupe performing
02:10:25 And it's basically a skit about a guy getting cooked. So that's the meta part
02:10:30 Is that the second half is like a whole skit of like a guy getting cut
02:10:33 But the the guy getting cut cut in the skit is like paglacci playing a person getting cut
02:10:39 And and the the kind of thing that happens is that over the course of the skit
02:10:43 He starts to become serious about it. Like he starts to like really like
02:10:47 Like asking like who who did who did you sleep me slip sleep with who who was what's the name of your lover, right?
02:10:54 and
02:10:55 And at the very end the audience doesn't know if it's serious or not they keep laughing because they think like ha this is funny
02:11:01 Right. They're like ha ha. This is a pretty funny bit. I like how serious they're taking it
02:11:05 It's man. Then he pulls out a gun. What a juxtaposition. This clown is asking these these hard-hitting questions
02:11:11 right exactly and then at the very end like, um
02:11:15 Paglacci is gonna like stab his wife to be
02:11:18 Because she won't tell him the name of her of her lover, right? He's like, oh, you better tell me. I'm gonna like murder you
02:11:25 Right, it's like it's like Othello, but with a clown right exactly
02:11:29 And then like as he's about as he's as he's as he's froze his arm ready to stab her like it's gonna go in
02:11:34 It's gonna plunge. She screams her last words. She screams out the name of her lover as she dies, right?
02:11:40 And and then it's yeah, and then her lover shows up and then Paglacci like stabs him too, right?
02:11:46 And everyone in the eyes are like, oh fuck. This is real and they run out
02:11:49 Right and there's Paglacci like alone in the in the tent and there's I think there's other people there
02:11:55 Like of the comedy trooper just looking at him and then he looked then Paglacci turns to the audience and says
02:12:00 The comedy is over and then the curtains come down and that's the end of the play
02:12:06 Hmm, so imagine that is Ronald McDonald. I think it'd be pretty funny
02:12:11 Yeah, yeah
02:12:14 Would it be I think I feel like you would need to like
02:12:17 Fuss food in eyes the cooking so there's not like a person
02:12:20 It's just so like you stole the the ingredients for my chicken nuggets. He's like my secret crabby patty for
02:12:26 Yeah, maybe instead instead of a play. It's like a commercial like it's in a commercial or something
02:12:32 I might
02:12:34 I might do that the thing is that the reason why I chose the Ronald McDonald cast is because like they each
02:12:39 Each like main core member of the Ronald McDonald can play a role in this
02:12:44 right like um like Ronald is Paglacci and uh
02:12:48 I forget the name of uh of his bride, but it's but she could be like yeah early. Yeah birdie
02:12:55 And and then the guy who the guy who cucks ronald could be the hamburger, right?
02:13:00 Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so and and also grimace grimace could play a role too because there's actually another character who's this kind of like
02:13:09 This kind of like I don't know if I don't want to say he's a hunchback or something
02:13:12 But he has like some sort of deformity that doesn't make him attractive
02:13:16 Right. Yeah, and this guy this guy actually wants to sleep with Paglacci's like wife of Paglacci's wife
02:13:22 Is kind of like ew no gross stay away from me. Everybody wants right everybody wants to sleep with Paglacci's way
02:13:28 And um and basically um this guy is kind of like guy who who wants to sleep with Paglacci's wife
02:13:36 It's kind of like he kind of like tries to push Paglacci to the whole like murder angle
02:13:41 Right because like oh if she won't if she won't have something with me. I will manipulate Paglacci to murder you in a way
02:13:48 Right. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and that guy could be played by grimace
02:13:52 Hmm. Yeah
02:13:54 Uh, I think it's a funny idea
02:13:57 I mean would it be
02:14:00 I mean how much
02:14:01 How how how how many pages do you how many pages? I'm gonna think maybe
02:14:05 32 I'm pretty sure I can tell the story and maybe under
02:14:09 Oh, that's under 35 pages. Yeah. Yeah, because the play isn't long like 10 pages a day
02:14:14 Yeah, the play isn't long because um, and if I mean I'm gonna cut out all the songs
02:14:21 Yeah, right. I'm just gonna just play out the general gist
02:14:25 It's gonna be played pretty straight and you know, it's actually perfect about the Paglacci play is that at the start of the play
02:14:32 Uh, one of the characters goes up on stage and explains to the audience that this isn't real
02:14:36 Like it's they say that it's based on real events, but this play isn't like these are just actors by the way
02:14:41 So if you get too invested just letting you know they're actors
02:14:44 Right, so
02:14:46 Yes, so what I was thinking is I would have grimace appear at the start of the story and say this isn't like real
02:14:50 This is just a parody. These are these are just the the mcdonald mcdonald character. This isn't this is not the real ronald mcdonald
02:14:57 Right, exactly. Yeah
02:14:59 Honestly, I I like this idea. I think it's good. Yeah, I think you I think it's very funny, right?
02:15:04 I could see you so I could see you getting I could see this being a hit
02:15:08 No, I yeah, I agree
02:15:09 I had this like in the back of my mind for a while now because I'm really I really like the idea of going to a con
02:15:14 And I have like a little poster for it of like a sad ronald mcdonald and it just says mcplaglacci on it
02:15:21 And people would be like what the fuck is that?
02:15:24 I like it. I like it a lot. You sold me. Thank you. All right, perfect completely sold completely
02:15:29 Perfect. I'm gonna try to have that done before this next con and then I'll sell it there and make a gang busters
02:15:36 Hopefully what's the next con?
02:15:38 What's um, it's called comic fest in san diego
02:15:40 I'm actually on a wait list because um originally I thought I couldn't get in but then um
02:15:45 One of our boof neighbors told us that um, oh you could you could still apply
02:15:49 And they'll just put you on a wait list because apparently people just drop all the time which makes sense because at this con
02:15:54 Um, there was like there was like two empty booths in our little section because they just didn't show up
02:16:00 So i'm like, okay, so i'm just hoping that
02:16:02 People just start dropping off the closer we get to it and then they they'll pull us in
02:16:07 and um
02:16:08 Yeah, and I think I think i'm gonna like email them again to sell them like
02:16:13 Hey letting you know i'm on the wait list, but i'm i am like a local artist who makes comics and just
02:16:20 just to see if like
02:16:22 That gets their attention more than like look you don't need another person selling like anime prints there
02:16:27 You know you can just have someone locally right like me
02:16:30 You know maybe yeah, maybe yeah could could help. Yeah, that's the goal
02:16:37 and I also
02:16:39 And I also have a secret project much like you guys
02:16:43 Have been talking about
02:16:44 Now now it's cheesy's turn for the secret project and this might be announced sooner than anyone thinks but um
02:16:51 I think I I think I cracked the code for the next hit
02:16:55 um
02:16:56 I'm going back to making slice of life comics. I'm making bongo and luna 2.0
02:17:01 But it's not bongo and luna bongo and tuna. Yeah bongo and tuna
02:17:05 Oh, like was it um, I forget my friends have like a parody name for the fake bongo luna
02:17:10 A bingo or tango. I can't forget camera. Okay, but but basically I'm doing it's not bongo luna 2
02:17:18 But it's it's gonna be kind of like a refined bongo luna. It's also gonna be gayer, right?
02:17:25 Um, and and dare I say dare I say this is gonna this is gonna make a merry weather a run for his money
02:17:31 I'm gonna tell you that right now
02:17:33 This is gonna this I call this one the merry weather killer
02:17:40 It's just the title of the thing. Yeah, which which which merry weather like uh
02:17:47 I mean is it because
02:17:50 I mean there's a cuz there's an internet explorer in it
02:17:53 Yeah, I was gonna say is it because it's like
02:17:56 Can you can you say what about it makes it a merry weather? I'll tell you
02:18:00 Okay, so I'm gonna tell you the only merry weather comic. I think I read all the way through
02:18:06 Was um, he did one called of my sucky best girlfriend, right?
02:18:11 Yeah, and so so my comic is gonna be in that vein of like oh my whatever whatever whatever
02:18:18 Right, gotcha. And I
02:18:21 I'll tell you guys afterward like done recording what it is like really quickly, but I'm just letting you know
02:18:26 It's gonna be it's gonna be slice of life. It's gonna be gayer
02:18:30 Then bongo luna. You thought bongo luna was gay. This is this is beyond gay. I'm in this comic, right?
02:18:36 Fascinating. Yeah, exactly. I'm I'm I'm hooked. I'm hooked beyond gay. It's gay isn't good enough anymore in 2020
02:18:44 We have to be beyond gay for everyone for everyone who thought for everyone who was like why doesn't bongo luna date?
02:18:51 This is gonna be the comic for you. I'm gonna tell you that right now. That's gonna be the
02:18:55 Uh, the homosexual clown comic. I see. Oh, I'm not I won't say no
02:19:00 I won't say anything. I won't say anything, but this is gonna this is gonna hopefully come out
02:19:04 Maybe in April. I'm gonna see if I could go back to making like a weekly comic. I'm pretty sure I can now
02:19:09 I've learned like so much more new things
02:19:12 To just pump out like yeah pump out shit faster. But yeah, this is just gonna be
02:19:17 Yeah
02:19:18 I feel I feel like I was just gonna say I also feel like you know
02:19:21 I've been drawing slime in punishment for feels like ages now
02:19:24 But I do I do feel like now I could do

02:21:48 Finally
02:21:49 um
02:21:51 Okay, uh
02:21:52 Well, I don't want to rush anyone, but I we've been going for two and a half hours and I feel like voicemails are
02:21:58 Coming soon. Yeah, I agree. I'm um, what do you what do you think gib?
02:22:06 Yes
02:22:08 I don't really have too much else to say
02:22:11 Because I have the topic the topic, but I could leave it for next time
02:22:15 No, you could go ahead and say it if you want to say it
02:22:18 This week well, it's just about the I've been playing a video game. I've been playing animal crossing pocket camp, but like
02:22:25 It's not really that interesting wait. Um
02:22:28 I don't know what pocket. It's the it's the mobile the mobile version of animal crossing, which is basically exactly the same
02:22:34 Is it new? It's fun
02:22:36 It's been out for a while. I think you played the old animal crossings, right like before new leaf
02:22:42 Or no before new horizons
02:22:45 I've never played a single animal. Oh, okay. Haha. So so uh pocket pocket dimension. What did you call it?
02:22:53 Animal crossing pocket camp is so pocket camp is identity. You're saying it's very much like
02:22:59 Ah
02:23:00 Well from from from my understanding you gather things you shake trees you fish and you catch bugs
02:23:06 And then you give it to animals and they say wow, thanks
02:23:09 Yeah, and then you become friends with them and then you invite them to your campsite and you can craft furniture that they like and then
02:23:15 They're like you put a microphone down. They sing at it. It's cute. It's been consuming my life
02:23:21 It's this all I have to say about it really
02:23:23 It must be it must have some differences from new horizons, right?
02:23:29 I would yeah, I mean new horizons you have an island and you can like sculpt it. Yeah in in pocket camp you have
02:23:37 like a grid based
02:23:39 campsite and
02:23:41 You can put tents down
02:23:43 Uh two different like amenities and then a bunch of like furniture in this large area
02:23:49 And then you can invite like 10 animals
02:23:52 10 I think animals at a time can just be in there just hanging out and talking
02:23:58 Chatting and like eating the food nice and you get like little quests to get like oh, I need like
02:24:05 A fucking stick insect you got any of those and I do and I give it to them and they say wow
02:24:11 It's great
02:24:13 Whoa, I love it. And there's a little that
02:24:17 There's a little garden to the side where you can like
02:24:20 Make flowers and like cross pollinate them to get special seeds sure
02:24:25 Oh
02:24:27 It's fun
02:24:29 You know what didn't um
02:24:32 Didn't just a couple of like hours ago the new pokemons got announced for the next gen
02:24:37 The next generation of pokemons. Oh, but they just but they just released a new pokeman
02:24:42 They they um, I think well, they said that's that's pokemon legends arcades. So I guess it's like, uh,
02:24:49 This is like the next one. No, this is like the next installment after sort of starting shield
02:24:54 Marin said they just announced pokemon rowdy and pokemon killer. I thought he was lying
02:24:58 Uh, it's kind of that it's scarlet and violet. Yeah, it's a red and purple. I am
02:25:05 Scarlet and violet, huh? Have you seen the news new starters for it? I'm just seeing them right now and uh
02:25:14 Is it is it just me?
02:25:16 But didn't we are like when I first saw those I thought like they were like fan pokemon or something
02:25:21 But then when I find out they're all pokemon look like fan pokemon these days
02:25:25 um
02:25:26 Right, but like to me they they look like pokemons that we that already exist like
02:25:31 Don't we don't these pokemons already exist in the game?
02:25:34 The they okay the the duck looks exactly like ducklet
02:25:37 Right. Yeah, that that one looks like one that already exists for sure. Um, and the cat
02:25:41 I know that ducks sometimes have like the funny afro
02:25:45 And I see it and I like haha that's funny, but like it is just a duck
02:25:49 It's they've done that already
02:25:51 I didn't isn't the cat looks like a lot like the other cat starter. Uh, the one that eventually comes
02:25:58 Yeah, yeah, like it looks it does kind of look like it just looks like green litten and it's like uh
02:26:04 It looks a bit like yeah
02:26:07 And then the uh, the middle guy the fire starter
02:26:10 Um looks like an apple. Yeah, he's like a sliced in half apple. He looks like he looks like the little dinosaurs from bubble bobble
02:26:17 Yeah
02:26:18 Yeah
02:26:20 They just feel like pokemon. We already got
02:26:23 Whatever they do a little bit. I mean, isn't there like literally a pokemon that is just an apple
02:26:28 Oh, there's appleton appleton and uh
02:26:32 Yeah, there were some gen six or seven. There were some gen seven pokemon that are just apple apple dragons
02:26:39 Yeah, yeah
02:26:42 Um, there's yet another apple looking guy. I I
02:26:48 I guess I'm I don't know if I guess I'm curious like why the fire guy is a is a plant
02:26:54 That's that's unusual, but like sure whatever
02:26:58 Um, yeah, I know the new game takes place in some sort of like spanish inspired like country or something
02:27:06 um
02:27:07 So maybe something to do
02:27:09 I'm gonna do it there. I mean, I don't know. I haven't played a pokemon game since
02:27:14 soul silver
02:27:17 I haven't played a pokemon game since sun and moon. I haven't yeah, I haven't played one since
02:27:22 Haven't played one since sun and moon. Haven't played a good one since black two
02:27:27 Uh, or white two
02:27:30 I might I might
02:27:34 I played I played black and and then I and then I played white two
02:27:38 Uh, yeah
02:27:40 I might I might play uh with platinum
02:27:43 I kind of want to play platinum at some point. Uh, I might do that in the future
02:27:49 Uh, so I probably won't play these unless everyone says like holy shit. They revolutionized it
02:27:54 I was I mean people people say that about arceus
02:27:58 Yeah, they they love that game, but like yeah
02:28:01 See seeing people really like our arceus made me a little bit like
02:28:06 Kind of kind of want to try it because like it's it seems like
02:28:10 People liked it a lot and it did look a little bit different and like yeah, that's kind of what I
02:28:15 It's kind of what I was hoping for in a pokemon game. So I don't know
02:28:20 But I don't know to switch. So like whatever
02:28:23 What am I gonna do nothing? It's it's
02:28:26 Like I know pokemon goes like the pokemon game on mobile and I guess they have a few other like mini game games, but like
02:28:33 I feel like it wouldn't be very difficult to make
02:28:36 An a 3ds style pokemon game for mobile
02:28:42 You know like like like x and y sort of level of 3d
02:28:48 I just would not buy a switch because it's a fucking thing I have to get
02:28:52 But the the reason I get animal crossing pocket camp is because I just download it
02:28:56 I was like, I wonder if there's an animal crossing game that I can play on my phone right now and there is and it was great
02:29:02 Everything should be on phones. I am a fucking mobile gamer
02:29:07 You know, I'll I'll say
02:29:09 I'll
02:29:10 These these pokemon these these starters. They don't really look like pokemon
02:29:14 They have the bit of like look like digimon syndrome to me or they look like they look like uh
02:29:21 I mean whatever
02:29:24 That's that's fine. That's not that bad. They look I like them better than
02:29:28 Uh groovy sobble and uh score bunny for sure
02:29:31 I yeah, I remember we had a very similar problem to those designs. Their silhouettes look too familiar
02:29:37 They look yeah, they really all look like they're like the same base creature. That's just like different color
02:29:43 Yeah, yeah, that I I hated that. Yeah here at least it's like
02:29:48 Um, like one's like a four-layed creature one is like two the other one is two
02:29:52 But it has like longer arms
02:29:54 And the head shape is different. Yeah, there's there's more variety in their silhouettes, which I like
02:29:59 But the but the little kind of I don't know they
02:30:03 I don't know like what I think like what's the point if I can play about pokemon. I don't play the games
02:30:08 Yeah, um people already there's already like 10 million fan art for all these characters
02:30:14 I saw I saw way more. I had to scroll past a silhouette fan art before I found the official images
02:30:19 I'm looking I'm looking at this
02:30:22 Okay, here's here's my problem. Um
02:30:25 Um
02:30:27 The the new trainers uh their hat uh way worse than the hat that the sword and shield trainer
02:30:35 Was there look uh, they look too young
02:30:38 The what is the the the the girl is supposed to be 10 I may
02:30:43 The girl in sword and shield was wearing
02:30:45 The girl in sword and shield was wearing that like flat green, uh, scottish hat the like the clod clod hopper or something
02:30:52 It's called you know what I mean that was way cuter. What is this fucking?
02:30:56 Cowboy hat
02:30:59 Too much like uh like school children
02:31:02 Uh, they are dressed. They are dressed like school the school uniform. I'm gonna I'm gonna post I guess in recent years
02:31:08 It's been a bit ambiguous the age like it's always been
02:31:11 Initially it's like oh when you're 10 you go out and you do your pokemon adventure. You just don't know
02:31:15 playing the game
02:31:17 The protagonist is around that age
02:31:19 You just don't understand spanish culture. Everybody dresses like this
02:31:23 I'm gonna adult like this all the time
02:31:26 Get uh get james, whatever he calls him. So now on the podcast give his take about this spanish culture oriented pokemon game
02:31:35 James
02:31:36 I think james used to go by lemon. Yeah used to go by. Yeah, lemon tart. Oh
02:31:40 Or or tarty art. I think they like to be right, right?
02:31:44 Firmly tarty art. Yeah, I remember now
02:31:47 Um, yeah, he'll he'll tell you this is just what he wears every day. So yeah
02:31:52 Um, but was he gonna say yeah, I'm gonna post this picture of the new trainers on twitter and caption it like
02:31:58 Oh, man. I am not looking forward to the porn for these guys
02:32:02 No, yeah, that sounds like a post you would make
02:32:07 Hey, they're a little too young for me. That's what I'm saying the other one
02:32:12 Yeah, the um, I mean they're all they're all kids I guess
02:32:17 claud hopper girl
02:32:19 claud hopper girl was kind of like
02:32:21 She still makes the rounds. I I see you could sort of you could sort of imagine. She was any age really like she's
02:32:27 You know, she's an anime character. She doesn't look
02:32:30 She's not she's not dressed like a little kid like yeah, these kind of are. Yeah, I see I see what you mean
02:32:37 Yeah, yeah, yeah, so um
02:32:39 Yeah, yeah, yeah
02:32:42 I can't wait till they start dropping the gym leaders to see which one is going to be the the porn gym leader
02:32:49 Which one was the porn gym leader in gen seven or gen eight rather?
02:32:53 um, and um,
02:32:55 The last one was
02:32:58 If I haven't seen if I have not seen any fan art at all of any of like the the characters from arceus
02:33:07 Really, no nobody cares about well, I I seen a lot of fan art of like the what is it the rival girl with the red hair
02:33:15 There's a lot of art of her
02:33:17 There's a lot of art of uh, I haven't never seen it
02:33:20 Really, well, I guess I guess I'm not really like
02:33:24 Yeah, I guess you guys aren't on the nsfw side of the car. Yeah
02:33:28 probably not probably
02:33:31 I have seen like a lot a lot of um
02:33:34 Of that I retweeted every time um
02:33:39 Oh, yeah, so uh, I guess another news um go go to my nsfw account, which is a
02:33:47 creamy pasta tc

02:34:25 Exactly. Yeah graveyard smash is is the name of the of the luna porn comic series. I've been doing
02:34:32 Oh, I saw her
02:34:33 Fucking a werewolf. Yeah, she fucks a werewolf in the first one
02:34:38 Sorry spoilers. I saw spoilers. I saw I saw that I saw that I did
02:34:42 Yeah, she fucks a werewolf in and in the second one she fucks a ghost girl with a penis
02:34:50 For all you all you ghost girl penis lovers out there
02:34:54 That's me. Yeah, exactly. And um
02:34:57 Depending how depending if I want more money, I'll make another installment
02:35:02 Um in the future. I'm thinking about depending on if I want more money
02:35:07 Yeah, exactly. Yeah
02:35:09 True. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So just check it out. Um,
02:35:14 Yeah, I I mostly just do porn commissions nowadays
02:35:18 um
02:35:19 You should uh, you should everyone out there should uh follow me on the creamy pasta tca commissioned me
02:35:25 I am currently
02:35:27 About to be laid on my rent and also, um, I mean, I guess I'll make this a quick story before we go into the
02:35:33 Into the questions, but um, yeah, yeah, I so
02:35:37 Guess who owes like a shitload of debt because uh, one of my roommates just disappeared
02:35:43 They just disappeared in November rents. Yes. He bailed on rent, but then we find out that he actually
02:35:49 Since the start of the lease
02:35:51 He has not been paying rent
02:35:54 And uh, you got to take him to court
02:35:57 Yeah, exactly. And that's that costs money, but he avoids us like he actively just doesn't like want to come in contact with us
02:36:04 Yeah, no shit. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, of course. Yeah
02:36:08 So the the game plan right now is that like, I mean the landlord says like, oh, you got to pay all that off
02:36:13 um before the lease is up
02:36:15 and um
02:36:16 And it looks like each each roommate here is going to have to pay over like 900
02:36:21 Um to cover for it, but um, we we got a couple of
02:36:27 You got a you got a you got to hold him responsible for that by any means necessary
02:36:32 No, I I agree. I think um, well, I mean the plan now is to
02:36:37 Cover just cover that the debt we owe and then sue him afterward none
02:36:42 And just just to fucking make sure and then he and then he'll give us the money we spent and plus more hopefully what
02:36:49 Hold on, uh
02:36:51 How how has it?
02:36:53 I mean, you've been living there. How long you've been living there? Um
02:36:57 Since I think the start of I think the end of june, maybe
02:37:03 How how have how has how has the landlord
02:37:07 Not said anything. That's another
02:37:10 That's another fucked up thing. That's the landlord told us like hella late
02:37:14 The landlord told us like six months in basically
02:37:18 That this has been going on and it's very
02:37:20 It's not good. We don't like I don't I didn't feel like
02:37:25 I don't know that yeah, that does seem fucked up like
02:37:28 I feel like she should
02:37:31 Like how how are you supposed to know?
02:37:33 Like yeah, I I have to like double check our like lease and just see like what's
02:37:39 Distipulations for her not telling us cuz I feel like she should not be able to
02:37:45 Just be like hey by the way
02:37:47 Yeah, one of you didn't pay rent for six months and the rest of you got to pay it now
02:37:51 Like I don't think she should be able to do that. That doesn't seem legal
02:37:54 No, no, I mean I I agree. Um, yeah, and uh, we've been talking about that with the other roommates
02:38:00 um
02:38:02 And it's I I don't know I have not taken the time to look at the lease and like
02:38:06 Yeah, I feel like you should be able to like just refuse
02:38:11 To pay for because that you're not responsible for that there's
02:38:15 Well, it's all there's all of our names on the lease like we all signed it together
02:38:19 So that's that's the thing we all owe it
02:38:22 I just don't uh, I'm confused how he was able to just not pay rent for six months
02:38:28 Like how like how does that just happen? I'm fucking surprised. I mean maybe like because it seemed like
02:38:34 I don't know this this landlord like
02:38:37 Is lenient
02:38:39 But like also like this leniency has like
02:38:42 Like she's let like too much terrible shit like slipped by you know negligent is the word. Yeah. Yeah
02:38:48 You're right negligent right because the thing is that we were like
02:38:52 We were like late on rent for a couple of months
02:38:54 And then she and then after like two months she dms. I was like, yo, what's up?
02:38:58 And um
02:38:59 And then we tell her like oh, we'll get you we'll pay it all back by the end of like january and we did
02:39:05 Um, I did start that one and go fund me
02:39:07 To like pay like the my late rent
02:39:09 But then around that time is when she told us that like oh this guy
02:39:13 This guy who the thing is this guy disappeared like at the end of like no like in the middle of november
02:39:17 This guy just disappears. We don't see him
02:39:20 For all of december. We don't know what's going on. Well me and my partner don't know what's going on
02:39:26 um
02:39:27 and then suddenly like um, she tells us this and it's
02:39:31 It's very garbage very garbage that she like waited this long to tell us this is bullshit
02:39:36 and
02:39:38 And apparently this guy just owes a shitload at that at other places too
02:39:42 Because he apparently can't pay his car
02:39:45 It's just so much
02:39:47 Yeah, it's fucking frustrating
02:39:49 Damn what a what is what a scam though like just move into a new place
02:39:54 Don't pay a rent for six months and then when and then just bail as soon as the landlord's like, hey, uh
02:39:59 What about rent for the last six months? Oh, he's gone already. It's just so genius. It's genius
02:40:05 I was was fucking annoying is that I know for a fact other landlords would like if you're like a couple days late
02:40:10 The dm you like yeah, what's up?
02:40:13 my my landlord uh when I was
02:40:16 I was uh a little I was I was like three weeks late on rent
02:40:20 And she and and she called me and was like you're late on rent and I was like lull. Sorry
02:40:26 And uh, yeah, well, uh tough tough titties bitch, and then you leave
02:40:31 Basically, yeah
02:40:33 Yeah, three three weeks free three weeks for rent. I'm out. Bye. Yeah
02:40:37 Uh, oh my god, exactly
02:40:40 Epic. Yeah, I gotta uh, but there's well you're in you're in california, right? So
02:40:46 I don't know. I know the massachusetts is very uh legal legally
02:40:51 Massachusetts gives renters a lot of protections which is pretty based
02:40:56 In massachusetts in massachusetts it is illegal for a landlord to charge
02:41:03 Did I I might have told this already? I won't go into it that long, but
02:41:07 She was she said like hey your rent is rent is late
02:41:12 You got to pay me two hundred and fifty dollars extra because your rent is late
02:41:16 Which is like so that's so that's a totally unreasonable. That's a huge amount of money. That's way more than is is reasonable
02:41:23 um, and it's also
02:41:26 It's just illegal for her to charge me anything late at all
02:41:30 Uh, because in massachusetts, it's specifically not allowed to like find a renter for a late payment
02:41:37 Unless they are more than a month late, and I was not more than a month late. So it was a complete like
02:41:42 Not not only was the number would not hold up in court, but just she's it would it's just can't do that
02:41:47 You just can't do that. Um, and I know that now. Um, so, uh, you know, I don't know
02:41:54 Renting shit renters laws
02:41:56 It's good to know if you're renting. It's good to know and look into and learn all the laws and shit because uh,
02:42:03 There might be some shit in there that your landlord you can you can kill him
02:42:07 You'd be like well, mr. Landlord sir, you violated
02:42:11 You violated code 17 146 and now I am the owner of the elder wand actually
02:42:19 And your spells will not affect me sir
02:42:22 I gotta yeah, this landlord has been kind of doing us some screwy shit
02:42:26 I mean she's led like a lot of shit slide, but then she's also like yeah
02:42:29 Like I remember she my deposit from the previous place
02:42:33 She tried to like give me less and I'm like no no I my deposit was this and I had like
02:42:38 I had like the receipt like on venmo for it and I
02:42:41 Screenshot and I shut it to her and she stopped arguing with me and she just like
02:42:45 Sent me the actual amount
02:42:47 I saw you my my um, I had a
02:42:50 Roommate here for a few months. He moved out and then just actually just by coincidence this last weekend
02:42:57 I ran into him. I ran into him on the the tea
02:43:00 And I'm like, oh, hey, man. What's going on? What's up? And he talked about stuff
02:43:05 We talked about this place and he said
02:43:09 He had told me previously that someone else that lived here told him
02:43:12 Don't even don't even worry about like forget about your your deposit
02:43:16 Like you're never getting it back the landlord won't give it back and this guy
02:43:20 He said well, you know, I moved out
02:43:24 Uh, she said he said the landlord gave him half of his deposit back
02:43:28 Because he agreed to like like give the keys
02:43:31 In a timely fashion
02:43:33 So he should have got the whole thing
02:43:35 But like he because of like some key shit he uh, she he was able to uh
02:43:41 She oh, she gave him half she gave him a half of what he of what he she owed him. So that's great
02:43:47 Is that legal to just give him half of the deposit back yet? Like no, of course not
02:43:51 Of course, I mean she could claim she could claim that there was some reason why she could claim that there was some damage to the room or something
02:43:57 Which like obviously there wasn't
02:44:00 um, so I'm
02:44:02 My goal
02:44:04 My goal is to I'm gonna try and be
02:44:07 As late on my rent as possible
02:44:10 for for the next
02:44:12 I'm gonna try and be as late on my rent as possible for until the end of my lease and then
02:44:18 I'm gonna not pay my last month's rent
02:44:22 This is my plan and then I'm gonna until you know, maybe maybe three months later. I'll pay it
02:44:28 Or maybe three weeks like three weeks later
02:44:31 um, and uh, I just I'll just I'll just like not pay the last one
02:44:36 And then my my and then if she asks me like hey, where's last month's rent?
02:44:40 I'll tell you like well, you have my security deposit, you know taking that
02:44:45 That's pretty good
02:44:47 I think it might work. I think there's a chance it might work
02:44:50 um
02:44:51 So, yeah, that's my that's my plan to try and not let her screw me
02:44:56 On my deposit because I know because I know she wants to I know this lady's fucking evil
02:45:02 Jesus Christ
02:45:03 Yeah, so I gotta I like your situation sounds pretty fucked up though. Yeah, I gotta I gotta look up
02:45:10 I need to look up like what are the
02:45:12 Our landlords really supposed to tell us if someone else is late on the rent
02:45:17 That something is not something is not kosher about that situation right exactly because like if that's the case
02:45:24 Like oh, yeah that landlord has to tell you right away when someone's like late on the rent
02:45:28 Then it's kind of like okay. Well, she hasn't told us in like six months
02:45:31 Right, so yeah, it doesn't it doesn't seem so if we can like if we can like use that against her
02:45:37 Also, this place was like a kind of a shithole before we moved in and luckily one of our roommates
02:45:43 Recorded everything that was like bad like everything that was bad in the place before they all moved in
02:45:48 So we all have that
02:45:50 um
02:45:51 It's just it's just annoying
02:45:54 And I think I've been too much on the sideline in this whole situation
02:45:57 I've mostly been letting my partner and other roommates kind of handle this
02:46:00 And maybe uh, maybe it's time to man up. I mean it's time to grow a pair and take my t-shots
02:46:06 Wow
02:46:08 Cheesy Manfredo, uh
02:46:11 What's the word?
02:46:13 Ark redemption ark redemption ark
02:46:16 Cheesy Manfredo doesn't gotta pay their late roommate ass fees ark
02:46:21 Oh god, uh

02:53:38 Making them answer questions lately
02:53:40 That's so weird. Yeah, I don't know. I suppose I suppose the whole like publicly
02:53:46 viewable
02:53:47 Rating system does encourage people to like performatively make the number go big or small
02:53:53 Depending on like the community
02:53:56 Does youtube rather than their actual
02:53:58 Interests like does youtube want the number to go big? Do they care?

02:55:49 That's kind of wild. I I recognize the screen name
02:55:54 I didn't know they uh, I didn't know they were racist far
02:55:58 Okay, yeah, maybe yeah
02:56:01 Not that jesse ain't here. You can't defend himself when we totally say that video was yellow
02:56:05 You fucking idiot. Check your eyes. I mean we said it then too. We said it was fucking yellow because it was fucking yellow

02:57:03 No, here it is long huang long huang dong
02:57:07 three two one go
02:57:10 Long chun is obviously just a bad riff on samurai sama. Yes, except where samurai sama. It's an actual character
02:57:18 Long chun is just a bad stereotype
02:57:20 Yeah, and being half chinese have bitten me. This partially offends me
02:57:25 Like that's not even a chinese accent. All your chinese half is offended

02:57:37 Yeah, bye
02:57:40 I think there is a voicemail. Well, uh, um
02:57:44 What was wang wang chang? What's his name?
02:57:48 Something he's got a voicemail coming up and last week he said big big things next week
02:57:53 So let's let's see what is let's see what his final his final plea
02:57:58 For his life and his freedom is before we before we put him in the slammer. All right
02:58:03 He's he's on trial this week. Yeah, so he better impress us
02:58:08 Next
02:58:09 Oh, yeah, uh next one is uh a youtube video
02:58:14 Yeah, and it is a link to okay. I watched this
02:58:17 Okay, i'm actually glad this person sent this video in this is a guy
02:58:24 CJ makes videos he made or he is making a uh
02:58:29 Like a retrospective series
02:58:33 About uh the pcp
02:58:36 Ha and this is his
02:58:39 first
02:58:40 Video about it. I think I think has he made any more since then?
02:58:44 No, he made this video three weeks ago
02:58:47 um
02:58:49 Okay, and
02:58:52 It's really funny. This is the story of this is the first bit it talks about like basically the the formation of the horse cast
02:58:59 but
02:59:00 Hilariously and and I appreciate it. It's does not start with digi. It starts with tbap. It's it's like, uh,
02:59:09 This guy basically, uh, he he diagnoses it as like tbap is the like, uh,
02:59:16 The central point around which the horse cast
02:59:19 uh
02:59:20 formed
02:59:22 And uh, I think it's I don't know. I just thought that was interesting
02:59:26 I'm not sure if I wonder what their argument is about that because it well, I
02:59:30 Yeah
02:59:31 It was definitely like it very initially
02:59:34 A jesse digi thing
02:59:36 And then I was in there
02:59:38 I guess maybe maybe if you want to say like, okay, but that wasn't it wasn't really like the pcp until
02:59:45 Kagan phantom. I don't know. Yeah, you two definitely had like a
02:59:50 A good mix with the rest of us to make her like a group dynamic that was fun
02:59:55 Yeah, I remember some of the earlier horse cast was extremely awkward
03:00:00 Where it was just me and the other two
03:00:03 This guy it's funny. This guy doesn't even like mention digi brony
03:00:07 Like he mentions digi brony as sort of a like, oh, yeah, and then one time, uh, tbap mentioned this other guy digi brony
03:00:14 And that kind of started a whole thing
03:00:17 Uh, I feel like if I were, uh, to
03:00:20 He does not mention to me to me the moments that kick started like hey
03:00:25 Maybe we should all be friends and make a podcast was, uh, when he doesn't mention when you made the the weekly roundup videos and you included, uh
03:00:36 You know, you would have include our videos in your in
03:00:40 Right. Yeah. Yeah, whatever
03:00:43 He doesn't mention those
03:00:46 Yeah, anyway, uh, this was a pretty good analysis assemblage. I came up with a yes
03:00:53 analysis assemblage, uh
03:00:55 Anyway, I like this video and I recommend people to watch it and I hope
03:01:01 It's good. And I hope uh, I hope he makes I hope he keeps going with it. Uh, I like it
03:01:07 um
03:01:08 Next voicemail is called. Uh, sorry. Where did or did they put it?
03:01:13 Um
03:01:17 No, I gotta go to
03:01:20 Oh, it's from son of marowak
03:01:23 posting it in the chat right
03:01:25 there
03:01:26 Okay, three two one go
03:01:29 So I've recently been reacquainted with twilight sparkles secret ship Vic folder and I've really been itching to make
03:01:37 Horseshoe crew style cards. I have ideas for goals ship cards and pony cards inspired off of the horseshoe crew
03:01:47 and
03:01:48 probably just general pcp lore talking about the horseshoe crew a lot today
03:01:52 I would make a digi bro card a princess
03:01:56 Unicorn well, it should be digi brony
03:01:58 and
03:02:01 I would have funny effects like
03:02:04 Uh, the meme that tom will never die
03:02:07 He could be a card that you can like take from the discard pile and put back on put back into the game whenever you want
03:02:14 Uh, I would uh, there would be goal cards like
03:02:18 For instance, it could be called rad con
03:02:21 And the goal of that
03:02:25 A card would get all the crew together ship
03:02:27 Uh, at least six like the lens of exodia horseshoe crew keywords so to speak and you get that goal
03:02:35 Uh, if you guys don't know the game like the ins and outs
03:02:39 I think it's a really fun game
03:02:41 If I know you've heard about it because you've talked about it
03:02:44 but
03:02:45 I'm really itching to make a expansion deck and if you guys
03:02:51 Would like to lend me your
03:02:54 Your voice and your opinions. Let me know
03:02:57 Yeah, I uh
03:03:00 I've never played the game. I'm I'm vaguely familiar with it. I'm I've seen it played
03:03:04 I understand sort of how it works. I've never played it. I don't really know
03:03:08 I I always assumed it was like
03:03:11 A pony version of cars against humanity. I'd never really looked into it at all. No, it's it's not like that exactly
03:03:18 I know you have to
03:03:21 You sort of build
03:03:23 Like a sort of like grid
03:03:26 You sort you sort of build like out in like chains
03:03:29 You chain like chain cards together through like shipping them together or something and you you're building towards some sort of like
03:03:36 goal
03:03:37 With it and I don't know that's probably uh wrong
03:03:41 But it's it's something like that
03:03:43 Uh, yeah, I don't really know how it's played. I know chris chan makes uh or was used to make uh, uh
03:03:50 Like she made uh, she made the slime city, uh new new los angeles city uh expansion deck
03:03:57 Which would be a funny thing to play with
03:03:59 um
03:04:02 Yeah, you could i'm sure you could make uh, you could make uh stuff out of lots of pcp memes
03:04:07 Uh, uh, yeah, you could definitely do it. Uh, I don't know if I have any like specific ideas off the top of my head
03:04:15 Uh
03:04:16 milking uh former members
03:04:19 for
03:04:20 For this new this new content. It's just all
03:04:24 uh, uh
03:04:26 If you make it about make it about the horseshoe crew and then we don't have to worry about the fact that nobody in the pcp is still here
03:04:34 Uh
03:04:36 Because the p the horseshoe crew is preserved in amber in the past
03:04:40 Along with everything else
03:04:43 Uh, next voicemail is called mario movie three two one go
03:04:51 I had this dream where I saw the mario movie
03:04:53 And instead it was a loop on the third movie or loop on the gang

03:05:13 Fucked up
03:05:14 So like the the real

03:08:41 We should look at the minecraft server. We should definitely do that. Yeah, we should definitely do that
03:08:47 Definitely do that

03:08:49 So, yeah
03:08:51 I'll join the patreon to uh become a patreon
03:08:54 supporter to join the minecraft server, obviously
03:08:58 Uh, second of all, I did not misrepresent your intentions
03:09:01 Meron Meron Meron sent me a dm about this before and I said, uh
03:09:06 He said he said that I was I was narcing. He was like, hey, I didn't I wasn't narcing and I was like
03:09:11 I didn't think you were narcing. I understand that you just wanted to inform me. That's what I said
03:09:17 I said you want you you messaged me. I don't know. I just I don't think I misrepresented whatever
03:09:23 Let's check out the might we'll be
03:09:25 Check out the minecraft server soon
03:09:27 Uh, okay. Good song though. I can't believe you wrote that whole stupid thing for the stupid
03:09:33 voicemail
03:09:35 Yeah, okay, uh, I'll be right back. Yeah, okay continue with the voice. Okay. Okay. We're we're moving right along here
03:09:42 Uh, the next the next voicemail is a Japanese
03:09:47 It's it's title is in Japanese and google translate tells me that this means defecation
03:09:53 Uh in japanese, so uh, that's pretty cool
03:09:57 Um, anyway, uh three two one go
03:10:02 The pro krastinators podcast why this name who came up with it and what is a krastinator? Come on
03:10:10 That's that's like the top of the iceberg
03:10:13 Come on come on
03:10:16 bro
03:10:17 Come on. All right next uh next who came up with it. Uh, I don't even know I don't remember was it nate
03:10:26 I think mage may have come up with it, but I'm not sure. Yeah
03:10:31 Yeah, somebody said it and everyone was like ha ha that's really funny because we don't work
03:10:38 Sometimes it wasn't it wasn't me for sure
03:10:42 I don't actually don't remember who I think actually it must have been because
03:10:47 It must have been mage must have been who mage
03:10:50 I think so. Why do you say that?
03:10:52 Because it was sort of a disparaging remark and I remember her being involved in the naming of the group somehow
03:10:58 Obviously the podcast is just named after the group and that came first. It's like what should we call ourselves?
03:11:03 We're not the horseshoe crew anymore
03:11:06 Actually it was a disparaging remark, you know
03:11:09 It was like ha ha like we're pro crest and aiding all the time
03:11:14 But I actually can't remember if it was major or not. I know mage had the discord server or something
03:11:21 The the skype group mage started the skype group
03:11:24 She yes, okay. Well, I don't know
03:11:29 And then she and then she also I mean then she also started the discord server when we decided to migrate to discord
03:11:35 um
03:11:36 Yeah, okay, uh, something like that
03:11:39 Um, I don't remember next one is a question. Ben. Have you played delta ruin chapter two yet? Uh, shamefully no
03:11:47 You shamefully I I was gonna I was gonna do it on stream and then I just never did it do it off stream
03:11:53 Yeah
03:11:56 Maybe that's what a gamer would say
03:11:59 I just don't want to do it. I don't want to do anything until slime and punishment is done
03:12:02 I can't justify anything. Well, that's fair. So maybe after that maybe
03:12:07 Uh
03:12:08 Next one is will jeff ever get cancelled for being on this podcast. Uh, I'm gonna say probably not
03:12:14 Who cares? No. Yeah
03:12:17 uh
03:12:18 Next one is uh
03:12:20 Message for crack on the episode 300
03:12:24 opening
03:12:27 Here posting a message for crack on the 300 episode opening three two one go
03:12:33 Hey crack. Um, first I want to say, uh, fuck you and second of all I want to say no
03:12:39 I genuinely want that to be opening for every episode. So, uh, yeah, you're wrong
03:12:43 And uh, fuck you again. Okay. Uh, well, yeah. Oh, I see crack assumed something
03:12:50 He I I did watch the last episode. Yeah, this this guy said make the opening for the 300 the opening for every episode
03:12:57 Crack said I think what this guy actually means is just that he likes
03:13:02 The episode that opening
03:13:04 But not that he would not that it would actually make a good
03:13:07 Opening for every episode, which I also don't think it would make a good opening for every episode
03:13:11 But apparently this guy's serious. Okay, that's fine
03:13:15 You know
03:13:17 That's that's okay
03:13:19 Anyway, next voicemail
03:13:22 Is called
03:13:24 Here it is wang chan is sorry
03:13:27 wang chan is sorry
03:13:29 Uh, here it is. Here's his final statement before we throw him in the slammer
03:13:34 three two one go
03:13:37 Wang chan is running behind kajua
03:13:40 Wang chan very sorry
03:13:42 In the meantime, how are you?
03:13:44 Okay, well next time
03:13:46 So so it's not even your big thing
03:13:48 Uh voice jail
03:13:50 Took too long voice. Yeah. No, I
03:13:54 He's got something. He's cooking up something. It's bad. Yeah, you're you should he's just a
03:14:00 He's got nothing to it. He's gotten I don't I don't believe he's got anything coming
03:14:05 It's probably gonna be bad. Yeah
03:14:08 It's probably gonna it's not gonna be good
03:14:10 It's not gonna be good, but I'm more I guess I'm curious. I don't know like maybe it's something
03:14:15 Well, if it if it appears you can still play it. I guess okay. It's definitely in jail right now
03:14:20 You know what? All right. I'll agree to that. I'll agree to that
03:14:22 We can get him out on uh on um parole for uh for a for a new hearing. Oh, this is this is like a
03:14:31 It's changed up from it's changed everything. He was going he was going somewhere with it the whole time
03:14:36 It was an ironic commentary on um
03:14:41 Anyway, next voicemail
03:14:44 It's uh next voicemail is a youtube link. Uh, let me post it here for you
03:14:50 All right
03:14:53 Yes, it's a link to the new uh the new void gazers podcast
03:14:59 That oh, oh, I I love this thumbnail. What's going on? I love this
03:15:05 This thumbnail is like fucking
03:15:08 The new adventures of batman thumbnail. Yeah
03:15:11 Uh, it's uh, you know, whatever
03:15:15 So I saw
03:15:17 I saw someone asking in a in a comment. No, there's one there's one comment on this video. That's really funny
03:15:23 It's a guy says uh great episode
03:15:27 Too bad no one's gonna see it because of this channel's limited reach
03:15:31 Uh
03:15:32 Boy, this is actually riley. I thought it was like a joke. No like channel
03:15:37 No, this is actually riley. What's happening? I thought riley left. I'm not up to speed with
03:15:44 Oh, okay. No riley, um
03:15:48 I mean who we can only speculate as to why but uh riley quit yig
03:15:55 And he cancelled void gazers
03:15:58 but he
03:16:00 But I guess he I think he just didn't want to edit it anymore
03:16:03 I think it probably was like
03:16:05 It's just not worth it and like I guess I who can blame him
03:16:10 Uh, so they're not doing so he cancelled void gazers, but then they started the new void gazers podcast
03:16:16 Which is like, I don't know, you know
03:16:19 Because they're not going to be traveling anymore, right? They're not going to like be doing road trips and seeing each other because that's expensive
03:16:26 Uh, so instead of doing that riley, trixie, mint and birds. It's just the same people
03:16:32 Yes, it's just the same it's just the same people
03:16:34 But only but it's only instead of seeing each other in person. They're just uh, I don't know
03:16:41 talking about how
03:16:42 much how revolutionary the donda stem player is
03:16:46 uh, yeah
03:16:48 so, uh
03:16:50 What else what else do I have to say about this? Um, did you watch this whole podcast episode?
03:16:55 No, some people in the discord in my discord
03:16:57 We were talking about it and I know riley is like really into the donda stem player for some reason
03:17:05 Uh, uh, he's trying to he's trying to get sucked up. He's sucking up to cotton. Yeah, he's trying to he's trying to get
03:17:12 He's trying to get that in with the a
03:17:14 right
03:17:16 What else what else is there to say about this? Um, I feel like there was maybe
03:17:19 um
03:17:21 I don't know nothing everything everything
03:17:24 Everything everything trixie tried to do with her channel was eventually
03:17:29 Fail a failure and just had to be had to be shunted off to some side channel never to be seen again
03:17:34 Void gaze is just no different. LeMau
03:17:37 Damn
03:17:39 She should go back to her anime podcast. She should go back to her anime podcast. Um
03:17:44 Anime videos are also not doing well. They're barely they're not even the new one got like 3000 views
03:17:50 LeMau
03:17:52 She should copy hazel again
03:17:54 Uh, I think she tried I think the new one is another attempt to be do copy hazel
03:18:00 But it didn't work
03:18:02 Yeah
03:18:04 Oh god, the next one is also called, uh
03:18:07 Void gazers lives on
03:18:09 All right
03:18:10 Three two void gazers three two one go
03:18:14 It's not dead. It's not dead
03:18:16 whoo
03:18:19 Hell void it should be they should have renamed the podcast the void gazers right on
03:18:25 Then it'd be ironic because they don't travel no more. Yeah
03:18:28 Uh, the void gazers, uh live live from detroit
03:18:33 It's
03:18:34 Okay, next force mail is called, uh, vacation time, baby three two one go
03:18:40 Hello comrades
03:18:42 Nikolai would like to apologize for waiting Ukraine
03:18:45 Nikolai would stop Nikolai on vacation right now drinking vodka. Yeah, not I know you I know you would never
03:18:53 I know you would never do such a thing. Nikola. Oh, is it is it is it unfair?
03:18:57 Is it unfair for us to uh, it's for us to, uh, hate Wong Chung, but uh, we're cool with Nikolai's, uh
03:19:05 shitty russian impression. Are we being are we every double standard?
03:19:09 I think it's mostly because russian isn't like a race. It's fine because in my head, um
03:19:15 In my head, I imagine that he's white passing. So it's okay
03:19:18 I think russians are white
03:19:20 They named a whole drink after it. Aren't they asian?
03:19:24 They're the same continent as asia, right
03:19:26 But they're you're right. Because they're such a white asian. What?
03:19:32 um, um
03:19:35 Yeah, we didn't even oh, yeah, we didn't even talk about uh
03:19:38 Uh, Ukraine this week. I don't think we have to I don't yeah, I don't really have any uh,
03:19:44 Trenching insights about it war war is bad
03:19:47 War war never changes
03:19:49 yeah
03:19:51 it's uh
03:19:53 Yeah, I
03:19:55 A lot of better people better equipped to talk about the situation I'm talking about yeah, and a lot of and a lot of
03:20:01 Worse equipped people too
03:20:03 Oh, yeah, especially I guess they see that one guy. Did you see that one guy who was encouraging?
03:20:08 Uh, uh, ukrainian civilians to throw paint balloons at russian tanks
03:20:13 Yeah, that was
03:20:17 No, I didn't see I mean that's it
03:20:19 What would have that done? Well, he was saying that like you can disable their cameras by hitting them with a paint balloon
03:20:26 Oh, see see oh, yeah
03:20:28 So yeah, yeah, so just just just go close to it go close to the invading army with their tanks and their infantry
03:20:35 And uh, real home throw paintball a long time. Shit
03:20:39 Real home. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we must uh, we must adopt the strategies of makaulik hulkin and home alone to repel
03:20:45 Yeah, you get a bunch of fucking grease on the road like oh
03:20:50 It drops where it was a couple of marbles on the ground and put in walks by and trips on them
03:20:55 Like oh, he flings up in the air before he lands on the ground
03:20:59 Uh, if only if only an frank had just hung a paint can from a string on the staircase leading up to the attic
03:21:08 Uh, that would have repelled the the invader
03:21:12 Uh, the nazis coming in right right and and I think ukraine can learn a thing or two as well
03:21:19 um
03:21:20 Yeah, so uh
03:21:22 ukraine
03:21:24 War is bad
03:21:26 Maybe maybe I'll explain it to the to the people in a way. They'll understand you see
03:21:30 Putin is emperor palpatine
03:21:33 And uh, russia is the empire
03:21:35 He he kind of is he kind of is like an insane
03:21:39 He is this crazy old fuck right now to get the fuck out. I mean, I guess he always was
03:21:44 um
03:21:45 You see ukraine are the rebels they're much like harry potter. You see and
03:21:50 Oh god, you uh ukraine is like
03:21:54 Uh, oh wait, you victor crates from in the in the in the uh, try no in the uh in the quidditch
03:22:02 I was gonna say the quidditch the quidditch world cup was the was what I was looking for
03:22:06 Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
03:22:08 Ukraine is a kim kardashian while russia's kanya. Have you seen the
03:22:14 the
03:22:16 Have you seen the the president of ukraine is just hanging out on the streets in Kiev while it's I've seen people
03:22:23 Like he's he's like vlogging from there like yeah, fuck really. I ain't going anywhere. Wow. Yeah
03:22:29 Like a big hard ass. It's just like it's just like out in broad daylight
03:22:32 Then there's like that's awesome to be like expected to happen. He's like we will not stand down to you bullies you motherfuckers
03:22:40 We're cool. That's like coming. You know, that's pretty cool. He's probably he's gonna die if you know, I hadn't seen that
03:22:47 I have seen people uh being pretty uh positive on zolensky. I have seen people talking about how he's a comedian turn president
03:22:56 Oh, yeah, yeah, I've heard that. It's pretty funny. So he's got he's got a he's got a I guess a neck for dramatic
03:23:02 That's very funny. What he's doing is is yeah, wait a second and it's really good for morale apparently because like
03:23:09 A lot of the russians who are being sent in are like teenagers who are forced to go and they were like tricked into
03:23:16 Like going yeah, I've seen
03:23:18 And they didn't even realize they were supposed to be killing people and they surrendered
03:23:21 It doesn't really yeah from what I've been seeing like a lot of russians don't like the war either
03:23:27 It's it's just like a which is good. Um, wait a second is it's it's really just a putin
03:23:33 That's what I'm sick. Yeah, like insanity thing and it's really
03:23:38 That he's has that power still
03:23:40 did wait a second in zolensky the
03:23:43 Wait, the ukrainian president the ukrainian president cranium wasn't he
03:23:48 Wasn't he the president who was who before became president?
03:23:51 He was in a comedic series about a comedian who becomes president and then when the series was over
03:23:56 He actually ran for president and won. Is that true?
03:23:59 I'm trying to look it up. I remember that I heard that like a year back or so. I'm like uh, phil the franco
03:24:05 I mean that would be that would be really funny. Okay. Yeah, so let's keep in 2015
03:24:10 Zolensky played the star of the television series servant of the people where he played the role of president of ukraine
03:24:15 You
03:24:20 The ukrainian president used to be a comedian and he's fucking he's like a mean
03:24:24 He's unironically more of a mean president than donald trump and he's like out there on the streets
03:24:29 Like with the fucking troops and everything. Holy shit
03:24:31 Amazing
03:24:33 He's what a basement. Yeah base. Um, he might he might suck. He might suck in other ways
03:24:39 He might but like I mean if you're getting invaded
03:24:42 Be like being being like showing solidarity with your people as they're being invaded is pretty cool
03:24:49 No, don't get me. Don't get me wrong. I hate your policies. Maybe I hate all hierarchies
03:24:54 You know, like a good little like a good little anarcho boy. I am but um, even even even an archo cheesy could say, uh,
03:25:01 Based I love presidents. I love I love liberal democracy. I love the free market
03:25:08 I love you. I love nato nato. Marry me. Have my babies. Uh, okay
03:25:14 I love nato charlie. I love nato
03:25:18 Uh, he he loved uh, i'm trying to think what's the end of the end of 1984 is like he love he loved nato
03:25:25 Winston Winston loved nato
03:25:27 uh
03:25:29 Okay, next voicemail is uh from overwatch
03:25:33 1984 is a good book. I like it. You know, you know, I think um
03:25:38 Damn, I don't know. I I'm gonna I'm gonna start. I want to start reading books. Uh, I should read books
03:25:44 Uh, I think I might go to the library. Maybe after maybe after phantom's revenge. I might go to the library and just pick up
03:25:51 Some books I never read before and read them
03:25:54 I don't know what to read. Wow. Make sure you take a selfie while you're down. So people
03:25:59 Books are for suckers bad read more comics
03:26:02 Here's the thing
03:26:04 Books books are for suckers, but I feel like I don't know. I think I
03:26:09 I think I want
03:26:10 To maybe start like writing stuff and I think that starting to read stuff might be a good
03:26:17 First step, you know what I mean? Okay, I got you. Yeah, I got you
03:26:22 Okay, but if you read enough comics, eventually you would have read the same amount of a regular book and that way
03:26:28 Uh, comics are for babies comics are for little babies that need pictures. I'm
03:26:34 Want to be in the realms of pure ideas pure thought
03:26:38 Damn Ben read read more dead clouds. That's
03:26:41 That's that will feel that'll stimulate you. I did stimulate your underside your your brain will tickle your brain
03:26:46 I did really like uh, fuck. What was the name of the one you gave me? Uh
03:26:51 It's david boring. Yeah
03:26:54 Yeah, david boring. I did I did like david boring a lot read. Um, you should read a
03:26:59 You should read a defray next because that's kind of like david boring, but there's like a superhero angle to it
03:27:06 I should I should read some more. Yeah, that's that's fair
03:27:10 All right, that'll stimulate your other side right there, buddy. Let's let's do the next one the next one wait
03:27:16 I post I posted the wrong one here. This is
03:27:21 What wait, um
03:27:23 No, no, I didn't the next one is called local print shop quote quandary 3 2 1 go
03:27:30 Hey last episode ben mentioned that his local print shop wouldn't give him the formula to determine prices and he had to
03:27:37 Bespokely ask them for every permutation. He was interested in yeah
03:27:41 And I wanted to mention that this is not just your local print shop. My local print shop is the same way
03:27:47 I expect it's uh every local print shop in america
03:27:50 And I think uh, I it doesn't make any business sense why they would do that. I think it's just not their bread and butter and uh
03:27:58 maybe like when
03:28:00 Companies want something printed. They already know what they have in mind
03:28:06 And maybe they're less price sensitive, but I don't know
03:28:10 If someone works in a print shop, it could be interesting to figure out why I figure they're
03:28:15 They're just not focused on it. They're stuck in the past
03:28:17 Model of uh, you call somebody up and you ask for quotes or something
03:28:22 Anyhow, just wanted to let you know that you weren't alone and it's a problem everywhere and it's aggravating. I mean
03:28:28 Seems like there's a really simple solution
03:28:32 Just tell me the fucking formula you fucking hacks like
03:28:36 Crap, I was giving me the crappy patty formula, please
03:28:40 the
03:28:41 The the mixam
03:28:43 Was the company I used for the lot of ghosts and they have a really good online like quote
03:28:49 You don't have to like give them your specifications. They don't email you later. You just type in the like
03:28:55 Like whether you want it to be hardback or like
03:28:58 Glossy I specifically mentioned how many pages
03:29:00 Uh, what page thickness and then they just give you exactly how much that would come
03:29:06 I specifically mentioned mixam last episode as one that I found while I was looking around for alternatives
03:29:11 Because uh, maybe you probably didn't catch it. Oh, no, you did. You said you did listen
03:29:16 I
03:29:17 Yeah, they were quoting me like they were quoting me like 30 dollars plus on like per copy
03:29:23 At my local print shop and I'm just not that's just not a uh, manageable
03:29:30 Threshold
03:29:31 So that's full color. How many pages is slime and punishment? It would be uh, it
03:29:37 It kind of depends. It would probably be somewhere around like 150 to 180
03:29:43 Ish
03:29:44 Okay, so not insubstantial. Yeah, it's not insubstantial
03:29:49 um
03:29:50 it
03:29:50 just so
03:29:52 Yeah, I print stuff through mixam too and I really fucking they get back to you quick too. Something's like wrong with your like
03:29:58 You know printing
03:29:59 Cheesy did they send you a sample pack because I I tried to get them to send me a sample
03:30:04 Pack of like different papers and they said it's like not available in my country
03:30:08 Which is very disappointing. They didn't send me a sample pack
03:30:12 Okay, who said that mixam
03:30:16 Mix it. Yeah, that uk based. That's why
03:30:19 Shifting is quite easy for me. Yeah, I just want to I just like trust them
03:30:24 There were there were a few there were a couple alternatives that I was looking at too though
03:30:28 So I may go with mixam or I may go with someone else, but uh, yeah
03:30:32 Okay, uh next one is called how do bicycles
03:30:37 Stay up three two one go
03:30:41 Hey crack if c is so good then how come endless war isn't written in c
03:30:47 endless war. Yeah crack endless war is written in python
03:30:51 Uh, and I don't know why I don't know if there's a good reason for that
03:30:56 I just I just started writing it in python. I think you know, I think it might be
03:31:05 Shit is it written in python just
03:31:07 Because I was learning no because I was learning python specifically to make endless war
03:31:14 And someone recommended python to me. I think I'm probably asked crack
03:31:20 And he recommended python as the language to do it in
03:31:24 But I don't remember why so yeah, you would have to ask him why it's and why it's not in c. I don't know
03:31:30 Uh, well crack was earlier in the call before I've been stepped in
03:31:34 He did he was here before we started and he and he spewed a bunch of like racial slurs
03:31:41 Yeah, yeah, I I believe you
03:31:45 Yeah, it's crazy. So I don't know. Do you have crack of
03:31:49 A characteristic behavior for him honestly. Yeah, just DM crack
03:31:54 Yeah, also there was a period where I would follow crack on twitter and he never followed me back. So I unfollowed him
03:32:01 Just want to throw that out there. That's uh, it's valid. That's a character character exposed
03:32:10 Exposed, you know, you know me. I check everyone who follows or unfollows me. That's my that's the strat
03:32:15 Next next voicemail is called a ramble three two one go
03:32:21 Okay, so I'm just calling into vent. I have no idea what's going on in the episode
03:32:24 But for some reason things weren't working well on my speak type on desktop
03:32:27 And it just wasn't picking up my audio even though when I did it on my mobile phone
03:32:30 It picked up things just fine
03:32:31 And I didn't know it was wrong given the fact that I could pick up my microphone fine on discord
03:32:34 But it turns out if I go into my audio settings
03:32:37 I didn't have my microphone set correctly
03:32:39 So make sure that you set your microphone correctly in your audio setting so that make sure that people can hear your voice
03:32:44 You guys understand that also give a good job with the game. I'm glad to see that you were able to make that
03:32:48 And I hope you can make more in the future. Yay. Thank you

03:37:01 Reference because they have an animal facts segment on that show, but I guess not it's just independently
03:37:07 independent
03:37:09 convergent evolution

03:39:03 three two one go
03:39:06 Hello, Ben

03:39:24 Yeah, you too. I didn't hear that. I didn't hear that last part but you too
03:39:28 they
03:39:29 He said he said, uh, we're based here and you're not he said any potential guests are based except for cheesy manfredo
03:39:37 Damn, he said that really quickly. I know it's really messed up
03:39:40 Yeah, I hear that from my mom every single day. She's like, yeah, he's pretty based after when cheesy's on but i'm like, but mom i'm cheesy
03:39:49 Uh, she she said, uh, whatever happened to the pizza party podcast. I never liked him on that either
03:39:54 Yeah
03:39:56 That boy that boy. He's just uh, he's a he's toxic for podcasts. He's
03:40:02 poisoned
03:40:03 He's fucking problematic
03:40:05 problematic
03:40:06 Uh, next next voicemail is called. It's ya boy three two one go
03:40:13 Hey guys, it's your boy here. Just letting you know that yix studio is officially dead boy gazers is no longer on yix studio anymore
03:40:20 Fuck trixie. Fuck you. Fuck everyone on there. Fuck you. We saw we saw that uh,
03:40:26 shunt it off
03:40:27 I I
03:40:29 I don't get why though
03:40:32 What do you mean?
03:40:33 But why is it different if all the same people are doing it?
03:40:37 Well, it's a different. Yeah. Well, it's a different show
03:40:41 Because in the sense that it's uh, it's no longer like video. It's just it's just audio
03:40:47 That's why it's the podcast now
03:40:49 They it's funny they
03:40:51 Riley called void. He he used to consistently call void gazers a podcast even though it's obviously not one
03:40:58 It's obviously like a vlog
03:41:01 Slash like
03:41:02 I guess you maybe could call we could generously call it like a variety show like a variety comedy show the times they would
03:41:09 do like
03:41:10 Live like, you know, it's like question people about stuff on the street or whatever
03:41:16 um
03:41:17 So it was definitely not a podcast, but he always called it one
03:41:20 But now it's the pot. It's the new void gazers podcast, which is an actual podcast, which is just them talking
03:41:28 Uh
03:41:29 So I
03:41:31 So, I mean, yeah
03:41:33 I get I I think I think that's why because there's no more there's no more video component or uh, or riley just doesn't want to edit video anymore
03:41:41 Uh, so now it's
03:41:43 Now it's the podcast now it's on his channel and that's what he wants. He wants that content
03:41:48 Now he's got it
03:41:49 I'm good for him
03:41:51 All right
03:41:53 One more voicemail
03:41:55 One more voicemail
03:41:57 Is uh, Nate is back
03:42:00 three two one go
03:42:02 I'm reaching back today. Thank you boys. That's good
03:42:08 Yeah
03:42:10 Wow, you're excited. Yeah
03:42:13 I love voicemails
03:42:17 Okay, well, that's it we listen to them all
03:42:20 Oh good
03:42:21 Somehow I had big nice. We did it. Yeah. Yeah
03:42:25 And only under four hours. Excellent. Uh, god, are we under four?
03:42:30 We're just yeah, we we we kept it under four
03:42:33 Shit, I had somewhere to I had somewhere to be at four actually. So that's a little fucked up. That's why I had to uh
03:42:39 Oh, well
03:42:40 Oh, well, uh, anyway any final thoughts before we conclude today's episode
03:42:46 Play pumpkin alley
03:42:48 Free demo you don't even have to pay, but it's nice if you do but you don't have to and
03:42:54 Leave feedback and look forward to
03:42:57 Kickstarter and other things in relation to it. So I was
03:43:01 Ish I was kind of curious actually I wanted to ask and I don't know if you'd be comfortable talking about this
03:43:07 But I was wondering if you like made any money in donations
03:43:11 Because I'm all I'm also hoping that people will donate to my to my game when it's out
03:43:16 We got a few donations. Yeah
03:43:18 Yeah, I think I got a big one from crack actually. That was nice
03:43:22 Oh, wow
03:43:24 Uh, can I like how many people donated? Uh, I don't have the
03:43:28 The numbers it's like maybe 10 people
03:43:33 It's something it's not it's not nothing. So it's pretty good
03:43:37 Uh, well, I mean, uh, I don't hopefully more will trickle in
03:43:41 I mean the the the point of the demo is not to make money is just to show people
03:43:45 To have something to show people when we're trying to like actually fund it and make the real thing. Yeah
03:43:51 Yeah, sure. Sure. Um, it's also a good thing. We can like bring to like a games convention and say, hey, we're working on a game
03:43:58 Any journalists want to write an article about it?
03:44:01 Yeah, I uh
03:44:04 You should have pushed the diversity angle. Here's a game made by a trans creator
03:44:10 I guess I guess I could throw that in there if it will work
03:44:13 For a thing or two, but I don't really care. But then for then wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute
03:44:18 Wait a minute a a trans gender game developer. Are you are you are you serious?
03:44:29 Are you
03:44:34 Unfathomable
03:44:36 Yeah, um, I don't know. I said gamer. I know trans people. So I don't think I'm gonna
03:44:41 Partake in this. Well, well, well gamers and game developers are like natural enemies
03:44:46 They're like lions and hyenas. They hate each other and they always will true true
03:44:51 True. It's uh, it's it's a abusive relationship. They share
03:44:55 Quite toxic to one another. Mm-hmm. I want the game to stand on its own. Um
03:45:00 First and foremost, I get you if I need if it could help I'll just say, um, yeah, can I have a table at this con?
03:45:07 Sorry, we're booked. Well, I am trans. Sorry, please. No, sorry
03:45:12 No, no, no, no cis people allowed at this convention. Yeah, no sissies at this convention
03:45:19 I'll I'll weaponize my minority status if I need to
03:45:23 But like I don't I don't care. Put that put that sound bite sound bite
03:45:28 I'll bludgeon people
03:45:31 Yeah, just just as you apply to convention. Just letting you know, I am trans. They're like, um, this is a transformers convention
03:45:39 It's not the same thing. Just letting letting you know. I'm trans. Uh, uh, sorry, uh, don't care that much
03:45:45 And it just smacks your own head with a hammer and I'm disabled now
03:45:49 Plus ratio plus
03:45:52 Yeah, yes, it's it's like the like a version of like, uh, do you know who I am? I'm making youtube videos. Um
03:46:00 Yeah, I have the I have so much social cloud. I could make you take a big L if you don't let me in
03:46:06 I could make or break you. I was on I was on uh, excuse me, uh, I don't know if you know who I am

03:47:06 All right, I just wanted I wanted to ask I wanted to ask about uh, I wanted to ask about money
03:47:11 Because I love money so much. Let me just ching ching
03:47:16 Okay, now it's my turn mom says it's my turn to show
03:47:19 Okay, so I I have
03:47:22 Read everyone read Villainverse everyone
03:47:24 If you have not read Villainverse, please read Villainverse. It's actually good. It's free to read or not
03:47:29 Actually, um, if you and you remember back in that shonen contest where everyone was posting their comic on medibang

03:47:37 You remember that
03:47:38 Oh, you mean um this the show the jump the one that give entered Clarissa in
03:47:43 Yeah, yeah that one right so
03:47:46 Villainverse is on medibang
03:47:49 And I looked at kind of like the ranking for like I guess I guess medibang just shows you kind of like western comics or anything
03:47:55 That's like in english instead of like
03:47:57 The popular stuff in japan, right?
03:48:00 And it got me and I saw like kind of like how popular kind of like western stuff is in medibang
03:48:06 And like it only gets a handful of likes
03:48:09 and and I and I see that um
03:48:13 I see that I tend to have like a bigger following than a lot of these other like western comics guys
03:48:18 So I'm like if anyone out there is a fan of Villainverse and you have a medibang account
03:48:22 Um, go to medibang. I mean just look at Villainverse
03:48:26 Go yeah, look at Villainverse on medibang and just give it a couple likes
03:48:29 And I'm pretty sure I could get pushed to the top of the ranking just with a handful of likes
03:48:34 Yeah
03:48:35 Yeah, dog and I'm yeah, I'm still cheesy manfredo on medibang
03:48:40 Uh, check them out. Check out. Check out cheesy manfredo on medibang. So is that where is that the only place the comic you can you can get
03:48:47 Is on medibang or is there the Villainverse? You you can read it on medibang. You can read it on tumblr
03:48:52 There's actually a discord this villainverse discord where it has a chat that just has the whole comic right there
03:48:58 And people can read it by the box by the books. They're all on itch. Also. I have new books
03:49:05 If anyone remembers luna from bongo luna, I have made two porn comics
03:49:10 And those are on itch. They're called graveyard smash
03:49:13 Yeah, and I yeah, they're pretty good. Um, she bangs a werewolf then she bangs a ghost and
03:49:19 I don't know what she's gonna. I don't know what she's gonna bang the third book
03:49:22 But it's not gonna be a ghost or a werewolf
03:49:27 Yes, yes toby fox crossover
03:49:31 Uh, I was gonna say a revenant, but those are those are just zombies basically those are just zombies. I can talk
03:49:38 So that sucks
03:49:39 She needs to bang someone with a vagina in the third book. We already have like two penises in a row. We need a vagina
03:49:45 I would say succubus then a fuck you. Yes
