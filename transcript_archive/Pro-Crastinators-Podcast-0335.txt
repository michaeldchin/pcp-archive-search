00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:12 The year is 2022. The year of Jorts the Cat's milkshake ducking. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators
00:00:23 Podcast. It's November 6th, and this is America.
00:00:29 Well, I'm not in America.
00:00:34 This, I say gesturing wildly around me, is America. How's it going?
00:00:45 It's going quite well. I'm having a good day.
00:00:54 Well, that's just great.
00:00:56 It is.
00:00:57 I'm really happy for you.
00:00:59 And why Ben Saint, are you unhappy today?
00:01:04 I'm not in a good mood. I'm not in a good mood.
00:01:10 What happened with your lecture?
00:01:13 Oh, yes. What happened with that was the render, it's an eight hour video, the render
00:01:22 was going to take about 100, 120 hours. And basically, I should have done this sooner.
00:01:29 I should have done it right away. I would have caught the problem.
00:01:35 I had uploaded a draft version to YouTube because I went into the description to add,
00:01:41 what do you call them, chapter markings?
00:01:44 Right, yes.
00:01:47 And so I was adding them on the draft version, and I just noticed an editing mistake that
00:01:56 happened a bunch of times, and it was unacceptable. So I was like, well, I fucked up. I have to
00:02:02 restart the render. It was already almost done by that point.
00:02:05 Dang.
00:02:06 That was like five days of rendering, and then it finished. And then I just like, well,
00:02:11 I got to fix the error and just start it again. So it's going again, and it is now at 52%
00:02:19 of the second pass.
00:02:21 Oh my God.
00:02:22 It's quite far.
00:02:24 Yeah, yeah. I think it's been going for about a day and a half? No, closer to like two and
00:02:34 a half, two and a half days.
00:02:39 Well, you know, whatever. Doesn't really matter if it comes out last week or this week. I
00:02:47 said last week, it'll definitely be out unless something fucks up, and it did. So, oh well.
00:02:56 I was a little surprised that you spilled the beans on what it was on Twitter before the
00:03:01 video was like uploaded or rendered, at least.
00:03:06 Were you?
00:03:07 Yeah.
00:03:08 Were you?
00:03:09 I don't know. I just felt like I would have expected it to be like keeping it a secret
00:03:15 until it was ready to be shown.
00:03:20 I thought I thought clueing people in early would build a little bit of anticipation. The
00:03:30 reason why I didn't want to say anything about it earlier was just because like, what
00:03:36 if I lose motivation? What if something goes wrong and I can't do it? I revealed it as
00:03:42 soon as I was like, well, there's no stopping it at this point.
00:03:46 Right.
00:03:47 Okay.
00:03:48 Yeah.
00:03:49 Yeah, like I kind of always meant to tease it. So I guess I'll say it again. It will
00:03:59 definitely be out this week.
00:04:02 Unless a terrible catastrophic thing happens again.
00:04:05 Unless a terrible catastrophic thing happens again, which you probably won't.
00:04:12 Yeah, there was a visual effect that plays every so often, and basically for the first
00:04:21 half of the video, the effect was playing like 10 seconds early, which is like completely
00:04:26 wrong. So it was pretty bad. So I was like, well, I can't leave it like that. If it was
00:04:34 like maybe one time that it happened, I'd have been like, fuck it. But it happened like
00:04:38 10 times.
00:04:41 I'm in a terrible mood.
00:04:47 What's so desperate to feel better that I did body weight exercises this morning. I woke
00:04:55 up and I was like, I have to move. I have to do something. So I did body weight squats
00:05:01 and push-ups. They have not been working out, unfortunately. I think I remember feeling
00:05:08 better when I did workout. So if I start exercising again, maybe it will improve the situation.
00:05:16 It is a pretty guaranteed thing, just blood pumping through your veins and stuff.
00:05:22 That's does do something.
00:05:23 That's what they say. That's what they say. Yeah. I went and hung out with an old college
00:05:32 friend of mine the other day, and that was fine. But I felt like I had very little to
00:05:40 talk about, and that made me sad.
00:05:47 That's it.
00:05:49 Like things currently going on in your life or just like topics you didn't have anything
00:05:55 particularly interesting to say about anything?
00:05:58 Things currently going on in my life. I'm not doing anything. I'm not meeting new people.
00:06:06 I'm not even like reading or watching anything. I don't know. I'm not doing anything.
00:06:16 They are making a video. Got my stupid video. Yeah. Yeah. But it's been like five days since
00:06:27 I was working on that. It's been basically done for almost a week. Now what have I got?
00:06:32 Well, I started editing the Slime and Punishment book again. Man, I started this year. I started
00:06:39 this year being like, I got to finish the Slime and Punishment book. And now it's years coming
00:06:44 to an end and I'm just like, all right, got to finish that Slime and Punishment book.
00:06:48 Everyone says Twitter's going to die. I hope it does. Yeah. I regret every moment I've
00:07:03 ever spent on Twitter. Twitter, like doom and gloom. It seems rational enough. I feel
00:07:14 people are like, I don't know, getting a little too worked up over the idea of Twitter not being
00:07:20 around anymore. There was a time before Twitter and we liked that. That was fine. We're just too
00:07:29 used to it, I guess. I don't really believe that anything is really going to change.
00:07:35 No, I don't know. I think Elon Musk wants to make good on the extreme money he put towards it,
00:07:47 so he's going to try and make it as appeasing to advertisers as possible. So the whole free speech,
00:07:52 all the bad people coming back, I don't think that's going to happen. I think it's just going to be
00:07:56 the same until it just becomes untenable and then Elon might try and sell it.
00:08:04 The things that are the most bad, the worst things that I'm seeing for Twitter's future
00:08:14 prospects are that it'll throttle your metrics. It'll throttle your visibility if you aren't
00:08:22 a $8 checkmark. If you aren't paying for Twitter, if you aren't paying for Twitter Gold,
00:08:28 then your results will be not favored in searches, even if people are following you or something.
00:08:38 I don't like people having checkmarks. I also don't like the idea that anyone can buy a checkmark.
00:08:48 I think they should just get rid of checkmarks if they really wanted to improve the website.
00:08:53 I mean, checkmarks have some utility in the proving that this is the actual person,
00:09:02 because there's something for that if it's like a politician or something.
00:09:09 I guess so. But the fact that you can just buy it removes that utility and adds nothing.
00:09:16 It does make it worthless. Any questionable value it might have had, it makes it worthless.
00:09:22 Yeah. I mean, all you'd really need to do, though, to make it completely useless,
00:09:30 but even more so, is to just download a browser extension to block
00:09:36 checkmarked people from appearing on your timeline. It doesn't matter how high up in
00:09:42 the search results they are, they'll just be destroyed. I mean, if everyone did that.
00:09:48 I'd do that. I'd do that immediately, because all the cool people do not want to pay $8 a month
00:09:53 for Twitter. Yeah, but the average Twitter user is not going to do that.
00:09:58 Well, sure. I can't remember exactly, but the idea that if you're following someone,
00:10:06 even if you're following them and you're not following this other person,
00:10:09 their tweets might appear first, just because they have the money, they have the checkmark.
00:10:16 I'm like, well, that's essentially the same as like a promoted tweet,
00:10:20 which I block anyway. I block as many of those as I can, because I don't want to see
00:10:25 things that I'm not following, because they're ads. And so people paying for Twitter,
00:10:31 they are become the ad, so I get rid of them.
00:10:36 Hmm. I mean, my tweets already don't do well and nobody sees them, so throttle
00:10:43 away, I guess. I won't even notice a difference. Yeah, that's another thing.
00:10:49 I don't think of Twitter as a career prospect for me. It's just sort of like a place
00:10:54 where I post something stupid. And if it's funny and make someone laugh, that's pretty good.
00:11:04 But it's not for like, it's not like a stage where I'm trying to put on a performance,
00:11:11 it's just sort of like a like a waste paper basket where I'm got like a bunch of like shit
00:11:16 I'm thrown at the wall and throw it like just thrown it in there. And then sometimes there's
00:11:22 a banger. And I'm like, hey, yeah. I guess there is like the like posting art is useful,
00:11:34 letting people know about things that are going on with your work. Yeah, because people don't
00:11:40 really subscribe to newsletters and email lists. And it's funny how many artists use Twitter as
00:11:47 their main platform, even though it's like it's really not it's really not designed as like an art
00:11:53 platform. It's just it's just where the people are. So yeah.
00:11:59 She's got a post there. I'm seeing all like that. Where are you going to go? Where are you going to
00:12:03 put your stuff? And I'm like, geez, I don't know. I guess Tumblr because that's the only one I've
00:12:07 had experience with. And I guess I'll just try and I never used Tumblr. I'll put like, well,
00:12:15 no, that's not true. I use it a bit, but I never like was attached to it.
00:12:20 I got kind of attached to it. It just sort of it. I mean, it's kind of the same as Twitter.
00:12:26 You just sort of like you follow people and sometimes you see things that are stupid and
00:12:31 people overreacting about something. And then you post your things and then sometimes you get a lot
00:12:36 of likes. It's the most analogous. Yeah. Yeah. I feel you, dog.
00:12:51 I don't know. I don't want to use Tumblr. I should stop. I should stop using Twitter. It's
00:12:56 a waste of time. I don't even like it. I don't get anything out of it. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of
00:13:03 it. I have discord with people I can talk to, which is a finite resource if there's no new people
00:13:09 entering. But I don't know. When it comes to like talking to people, having like a community,
00:13:16 Twitter is not the place for a community really. No, it's really not. I should have made more
00:13:24 videos. I should have put more videos on my channel instead of making all the like thousands and
00:13:29 thousands of tweets that I've written. Should have applied that time a lot better.
00:13:36 Yeah. Coming up on 10 years I've spent on Twitter.
00:13:40 Wow. Maybe nine. I mean, some of those times I was more on it than others. But yeah,
00:13:45 I just want the 10 years back, please. I think I started a little later. I was on there in like
00:13:53 2015, 2014. I was looking through some of my older tweets just because
00:14:01 and I remember that I would only do puns. I would do puns so often and so many of them
00:14:09 that I'm like, wow, I was funnier. These are like, they're so all over the place and a lot of them
00:14:17 feel like I was funnier. I feel like I used to be funnier. They require a lot of like setup,
00:14:22 but they're like, yeah, I read that and I'm like, that's funny. The things I do now are like,
00:14:29 what if I was cringe, but actually not? What if I was base? I don't know,
00:14:34 like the tweets I'm posting now, they're sometimes funny, but like the style of humor is different.
00:14:42 I'm like, wow. I see. I see. I've just, I don't know, I haven't just haven't really been
00:14:48 making tweets lately. I don't really, I was, I was, man, I was scrolling through.
00:14:55 It was for the Simon punishment book. I'm formatting the notes. I'm at, I had written like
00:15:01 notes in Erata, but I decided that I want to add in some records of like me and Chris's DMs
00:15:07 and like the images that she made for me, like like the cards that she made out of the
00:15:13 out of the comic panels and stuff. I decided to put a section or add that in. So I was going through
00:15:19 my old Twitter, you know, replies and stuff looking for those. And oh my God, I just hate,
00:15:29 I'm so annoying. I'm so fucking annoying on Twitter. I'm so terrible. I hate myself.
00:15:36 You have been very aggressive with the, the, the replies to people being stupid.
00:15:44 I, I don't, that's not, I don't, that's not even what I'm, that's not even, that's the,
00:15:48 if anything, that's the one thing that I like looking at my tweets is times that I mean to people.
00:15:55 Yeah. Sometimes I do, I have enjoyed like going through a thread where you've gotten into a
00:16:02 scuffle with someone, like read up everything that's happened and they're always in the wrong, but yeah.
00:16:09 I'm always in the wrong. No, no. Well, I can't remember. Sometimes, but most of the time you're
00:16:15 not. Maybe sometimes, maybe sometimes. I mean, I feel like usually when I'm mad, I'm mad with
00:16:20 purpose, but that's not even what I'm talking about. I'm just talking about, I don't know. I just,
00:16:25 whenever I, when I have like a genuine opinion to express, I don't know. I always feel, I,
00:16:30 reading my old tweets, I'm always like, I'm so ham-handed. Like I'm so, I'm so like, I'm so like
00:16:38 bluntly expressing just like a completely banal opinion, but I'm saying it in a way that like,
00:16:43 it feels like I'm doing something and like it's so stupid. I should have, like I should have just
00:16:48 not said anything. Was it banal at the time or is it just sort of like, like, I mean in hindsight,
00:16:56 it seems banal. I don't know. My fucking stupid, when I was like really like,
00:17:01 when I was really like election posting around 2019, it's like, shut up.
00:17:09 When I'm really, at times when I made some like really stupid, I don't know, you know,
00:17:15 some garbage that no one cares about, like trans rights or something or like, that Bernie Sanders
00:17:20 is good. You know, it's like, why did I, why did I bother? What was, what was the thing you did
00:17:29 by Bernie where Yang or something? Oh, I don't know. I might have said, yeah, that sounds vaguely
00:17:36 familiar. Like, like, how's, like, what's, what's the joke? What am I, what am I doing?
00:17:44 What's the bit? I think the bit was that you liked Yang for a bit and then you're like, wait a
00:17:48 minute, nah. I know. That's not even, I know. That's not funny. It's not funny. It's just sad.
00:17:58 It's just sad. I don't know. So I felt really just terrible. I felt just really terrible reading
00:18:04 through all my, a record of my thoughts and opinions from the last several years. And it
00:18:14 just made me think like, what am I doing? What's, what's the point of me?
00:18:21 Oh, no. What's the point of Ben saying? It's not good. It's not good, dog. I don't know.
00:18:28 Well, I mean, Twitter's always been, I don't feel too good about it. Twitter's always been like,
00:18:33 the quickest and easiest way to be the worst version of yourself.
00:18:37 It is.
00:18:38 So don't feel like that represents you entirely.
00:18:41 Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. I should live in the real world more. I just, I just don't know how.
00:18:52 I've forgotten how.
00:18:55 I think a lot of people have forgotten how. What do you do? You just, you walk around and you,
00:19:00 you bump into someone and then you say, oh, sorry.
00:19:04 That's what I do. Yeah. What do you do? You walk around, you walk around, you walk around outside.
00:19:09 Do you like, I don't know, I take me and me and my, me and my buddy. We went to a bar,
00:19:17 but like, we just, we just sat there. We just sat there and chatted, same as we would have at the
00:19:22 house. Like they say like, Oh, be social, like go out to a bar. Well, we just sat there and talk
00:19:26 same as we would at the house. We might as well not have left the house. Like, what's the point?
00:19:30 Uh, what is the point?
00:19:32 Nice drinks, a nice atmosphere, maybe. Sure. Sure. I guess. Sure. I guess.
00:19:39 Just saying it wasn't, it wasn't like, I don't know. It wasn't like an opportunity to meet people.
00:19:47 No. It never, it never feels that way.
00:19:49 It, I've never experienced a time like that in a bar.
00:19:54 No. It's, it's sort of a bygone age sort of thing. People already have their friends and
00:19:59 go to the bar with them. Yeah, it seems that way. And they meet them earlier in life at school or
00:20:05 at work. And yeah, that's the only two places that seem like the normal place to meet a person
00:20:11 that's not artificial. Yeah, that's right.
00:20:19 Bleak. Bleak.
00:20:22 There was a little bit like with social media, like Twitter or whatever,
00:20:27 you would find like-minded people, you would retweet this stuff. If it was good,
00:20:32 they might find yours and retweet it. And then you'd have like a Twitter buddy.
00:20:35 And then, yeah, and then, uh, you know, hypothetically, you go to a convention,
00:20:42 they just happen to be there or that, you know, you can do some sort of like,
00:20:48 like breaking ice first contact through social media and then become out in the real world later.
00:20:57 Doesn't happen a lot, but it's like, it's something.
00:21:02 Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I don't really have that. I don't have Twitter buddies.
00:21:08 I have people whose posts I admire, but it's not the same.
00:21:14 Yeah. Think about the way the PCP formed. It was kind of that, but on YouTube specifically,
00:21:21 we made videos on a social media platform and it's like, you're good at those videos.
00:21:27 Let's meet up on the internet and we got a Skype.
00:21:30 Let's do a podcast or whatever. Yeah. Let's record a-
00:21:34 We're content creators.
00:21:36 A conversation between all of us. Yes. We are content creators.
00:21:42 Uh, yeah. That was, uh, that was pretty good. You know, I feel like maybe these
00:21:53 problems, the problems of not living in the real world, not having opportunities to
00:22:00 socialize, I feel like maybe those would solve themselves if I could find somewhere inside of
00:22:08 me some sort of passion for anything. And then I would naturally pursue that. And then,
00:22:15 you know, things, things would happen around that. But alas, there's nothing there. It's just void.
00:22:21 Void void. So, you know, it's a truly, truly is a vicious, a vicious and self-compounding
00:22:29 a cycle that I find a vortex that I find myself in I mean and that's why I did pushups this
00:22:39 morning to cope with that cope pushups are good all pushups are good and yeah they felt all right
00:22:47 I would do them again I obviously can't speak for you but like surely um passion for certain
00:22:58 things exists it's just it's just that like they might not be a creative endeavor they might just
00:23:04 be like a video game or like I don't know some probably that you could get into I guess I like
00:23:15 making gummies yeah I guess I like that uh it's it's it's fine it's fine at all I don't know
00:23:31 finding I don't know when you feel like you have not because I felt like that before as well like
00:23:36 seriously like lacking in in a passion for anything it's like wow why would I do anything
00:23:42 hmm what is and like like nothing is gonna lead to anything and it's gonna and I'm fucked to no
00:23:50 matter what it sucks you know it's like they're all like depression talking points you might just
00:23:57 have a big depression that you need to work through and then you'll you'll remember that
00:24:03 you actually do like things but the you know working through depression by yourself is very
00:24:09 difficult because you're in a you're in a bad headspace of space where like your your conclusions
00:24:18 are faulty and based on uh on like exaggerated negative like outcomes that you're imagining
00:24:28 are definitely gonna happen or have already happened and you know yeah your brain's compromised
00:24:36 I think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well I mean I guess so I guess that makes sense
00:24:49 uh I don't know get you a therapist for real
00:24:56 oh no there's there there there it is you've got a passion for not getting a therapist
00:25:02 see yes yes the one thing that gets me out of bed in the morning is the idea that I can spend the
00:25:09 whole day miserable like hell yeah another day that's gonna suck it's really it's really like
00:25:20 the obvious thing and the fact that you don't want to do it means it's good it's good for you
00:25:25 hmm well I don't want to do a lot of things I don't want to jump off a bridge
00:25:31 yeah but you don't think you don't stand by a bridge and be like ah jumping off the bridge
00:25:37 I know I should jump I know I should but like I just don't want to not yeah no that's not what I
00:25:42 mean it means it's like um uh when you're like scared of an outcome of something that means you
00:25:50 want to do it because you wouldn't care at all if if you if you weren't scared of failure or scared
00:25:56 of of it being fucking worthless perhaps I'm scared of my video failing yeah so that means
00:26:04 you care about the video yeah I really do yeah I actually like um on on the one hand you know I
00:26:13 sort of in the video I explained this and then I restructured my patreon and stuff I explained
00:26:19 that like okay I want to like focus on these more I can make more of these I can make you know I can
00:26:25 do a reward as like a like we can have a vote I'll let people choose a topic for me you know I want
00:26:32 to lean more into this um and that's like so on the one hand I it's kind of scary like okay well
00:26:38 if the video completely flops it's just going to be really embarrassing and I'm going to be like
00:26:42 well I guess my whole plan had no legs and I overreached and committed a strategic error
00:26:49 and now I got egg on my face what a rube on the other hand it's like oh well if it does succeed
00:26:56 of the video does really well a lot of people pledge like yes I want to see more like this
00:27:00 I love long youtube videos I want to vote on a topic for this idiot to explain it's like well
00:27:07 then I got to do stuff and that's scary yeah uh so yeah but I'm but I'm just I'm just um
00:27:22 the way the way things have been going uh cannot continue you know like once the once like other
00:27:29 than the slime and punishment book which I have been encountering hurdle after hurdle for
00:27:34 like what am I really doing like I'm not really working on any any videos or something
00:27:38 not I'm not like actively drawing comics although I do intend to do more of that in the future so
00:27:43 it's like well if I can turn if I can turn my big hit if I can turn my biggest hit the lectures
00:27:49 into like a a sort of semi-regular thing that I do for a semi-stable income it's like that seems
00:27:56 like that seems like a positive direction to be moving in so at some point I just decided I'm
00:28:03 gonna I'm gonna make this that I'm gonna do that and do my give it my best shot and I just
00:28:10 committed to it followed through on that notion even even though I wasn't really feeling it a lot
00:28:17 of the time even though I'm like oh this video is so embarrassing like oh I look really bad like
00:28:23 oh what am I talking about like oh I I'm repeating myself I sound like an idiot uh I just kind of
00:28:30 had to step outside and look at it from like an outsider's perspective and be like you're kind
00:28:34 of you're those things those things don't matter the object objectively the thing to do is just
00:28:41 is just follow through on this thing that you've already like sunk you know so much effort into
00:28:47 you you can't you can't give up yeah and I didn't it's good it's good to keep busy I would say if
00:28:57 you if you're like um you have you're in between projects that's a moment where your motivation
00:29:04 can like plummet because you're not currently working on anything you have to think yeah um
00:29:10 so you should try doing a small thing that can sort of bridge the gap between the megaman lecture
00:29:19 being released and whatever you do next if the lecture is a big hit you can work on start working
00:29:25 on the next one if it's a big flop you might have to do something else maybe go back to one of your
00:29:30 comics yeah but you should have something going on in the background something you can be saying
00:29:36 you're you're working on you could do commissions that's quite an easy little thing oh I hate
00:29:41 commissions I know that sometimes they're they're really rough because it's like but like it's
00:29:47 something I could I could do them like I could I could do them you I don't really like doing them
00:29:54 so I've I've avoided it mostly yeah uh you could do like a really small short project like a short
00:30:01 comic or uh I guess it's nano-rimon national novel writing month you could write something
00:30:11 I do feel I've been saying this for a long time I do feel like I should write more I feel like I
00:30:15 should try to write essays yeah but make sure you're on the one hand right now on the one hand
00:30:25 I feel like maybe I should write I should write essays but but simultaneously I'm like well but
00:30:32 I'm but I'm but I'm leaning into the lecture thing that's that's mostly unscripted so that's
00:30:40 kind of like two two different things why can't you do two different things I I don't know it's
00:30:48 just impossible for reasons I don't understand you could have lectures and essays yeah I could
00:30:56 I mean I guess there's no like there's no like expectation of like a lecture every month or
00:31:02 anything like that yeah I don't know I would like to write essays but again it's like I just don't
00:31:09 care about anything enough to write thoughts about them I don't know I wish I wish I had something I
00:31:17 was like really excited about and I'd be like man I have thoughts about this thing I'd like to get
00:31:22 them down in like written form and then maybe record those that writing in audio and put it on
00:31:28 YouTube or something that would that would be pretty that would be pretty great I was talking I
00:31:35 don't know if I talked about on the PCP I probably did a little while ago I had an idea for a
00:31:40 hypocrite video I spent a little time um thinking about like how I would go about getting the data
00:31:50 necessary to come to the conclusion because it was like a it was a lore-based video it was like
00:31:56 trying to stitch dark cloud and dark cloud two together in a way that they're deliberately
00:32:04 unconnected timelines could connect in a hypothetical sense and it was just sort of like
00:32:12 okay so I'd have to play both of the games and pay close attention to all the dialogue maybe I'd
00:32:16 have to go to the Japanese version you know there's there's lots of things I could do and I was
00:32:21 stunned to write like a plan I never really got into actually thinking I was gonna do it
00:32:31 but that was that was an enjoyable little like a thought experiment like the the concept of that
00:32:39 I don't know why why I thought of it but like it's a game I like and the sequel is like notorious
00:32:45 for being similar in so many ways but completely divorced from the original story from the first
00:32:52 game the sequel so it's like so why why are they why is it why does it look so similar why
00:32:58 does some characters exist but the story is completely different universe so you just had no
00:33:04 intention at any point of actually doing it I I still might do it it's not like I've abandoned
00:33:11 the idea it's just sort of like that's that's the the the nexus of like a cool idea is something
00:33:18 that I'm familiar with from my childhood I mean I mean it sounds in I'd want to see that video
00:33:28 yeah I mean sounds like a good idea to me I think I might do it it just would require a bit of like
00:33:35 planning around playing the game imagine a hypocrite video in 2022 2023 it'd probably be at this point
00:33:43 just because I've got I've got like um focus on on Clarissa first oh yeah how's that going
00:33:51 um this past week since the last pcp I've hadn't really had a lot of time because I
00:33:58 went traveling for a few days on halloween and I came back and I was tired from that and then
00:34:07 I just sort of didn't work for the rest of the week I was so like hey whatever
00:34:12 so I'm gonna work properly we're gonna get back to it properly next week
00:34:15 um it's just like a mini holiday I suppose
00:34:21 but it's it's it's close to the end like it was last week
00:34:26 close to the end of the like sketching out and sketching yeah
00:34:34 sorry I should know this remind me how many pages how many new pages sketched are there
00:34:39 like do you say like 30 or 50 there's like uh I'm trying to remember uh sketching hasn't started
00:34:48 like the the ending is what Clarissa but blocking it's like 100 and something new pages
00:35:00 maybe 130 I'm not sure I'll have to properly count them because I still might add like a few
00:35:05 on close to the final few shots and then I'm gonna have like a an epilogue bit which would be like
00:35:11 five pages maybe um so yeah it's a lot I might stream it I might stream the line art or something
00:35:22 maybe the sketching I don't know sketching is also quite mentally taxing because you're
00:35:29 it's not that you have to figure out where the panel sits in the page layout and what
00:35:34 information is being explained in the panel but you do need to think of how the body looks how the
00:35:39 pose works the what parts of like how best to portray the thing that I've already decided must
00:35:48 be portrayed in this panel that's a lot of thought it goes into that probably gonna have to draw and
00:35:54 redraw things a lot so maybe I shouldn't stream the sketch but the line art would be like
00:35:59 hopefully very nice and chill and like just hang out it could be something
00:36:07 you know I tried uh streaming uh the uh the other day for rfck and it was mostly successful there was
00:36:16 like a moment where the stream died in the middle uh because my internet just like stopped working
00:36:22 for a sec still disappointing I I don't know what that happens
00:36:29 huh do you know what that happens that that seems to have happened just in calls like you can't
00:36:35 access web pages but you're still in the call yeah it oh god I'm damn it I'm connected through my
00:36:42 I just checked and I've forgotten yeah even even right this moment I am connected through my
00:36:48 mobile hotspot which is terrible it's seriously like every day that like some shit happens and
00:36:54 my internet dies and I have to switch to my fucking phone hotspot and even in that fails
00:37:01 sometimes as well it's it's honestly like unacceptably bad and I don't know why like
00:37:06 it's been allowed to be this way but like I don't hear anyone else complain uh and I don't know who
00:37:13 to complain to and I don't know if it would accomplish anything uh because I mean we have
00:37:22 internet service it just sucks yeah I guess if the plan is not good enough you would just need to
00:37:30 try and improve the plan get a different maybe I can just tell that guy like hey I'll just pay
00:37:37 extra for a better plan yeah that's that's a solution honestly do you have like the thing
00:37:44 that goes in the wall that the booster um yes but it didn't uh like the guy the guy told me
00:37:56 that they already have one that's like okay I don't really understand all right I don't know
00:38:01 what he the the extender is supposed to like extend the signal he told me that like they've
00:38:08 already got an extender but it's like in his room like right next to the the the the router
00:38:15 or the modem or whatever you call it and it's like well what's the point of an extent the
00:38:19 point of an extender is that you put it further away to extend the signal yeah so like I think
00:38:26 I'm already picking it up out of an extender uh I don't know uh so you know what as I as I explain
00:38:39 it I'm thinking maybe I should try it regardless of the fact that he told me it was unnecessary
00:38:45 maybe I should try setting it up I tried setting it up before and it didn't work and I don't remember
00:38:49 why it didn't work but maybe it's worth another shot I don't know yeah I don't know I don't
00:38:53 know if it would even help because it's like I'll have a signal it'll tell me that I have a signal
00:38:58 but then like web pages will just stop loading or like discord will just die or the voice call
00:39:04 will die or the stream will die even though it says the signal is strong and and other other
00:39:09 times it says like no signal or like interrupted signal uh internet Wi-Fi is confusing I tried
00:39:18 to figure it out a while ago but I don't think I really gained any knowledge I think the one thing
00:39:25 is that there's two types of things there's a plug in the wall like booster that uses the
00:39:32 electricity the house and there's an extender which is different and it extends the Wi-Fi signal
00:39:41 somehow with a little antenna and the the booster you plug the router
00:39:47 into it and that goes into the wall and then you use the houses like electricity grid and then
00:39:54 out of another socket you can have the Wi-Fi like be transmitted through the you know wherever you
00:40:01 put the the other socket thing and that's what I have in my room and my internet's fine
00:40:08 shit otherwise the Wi-Fi doesn't reach yeah you can plug like a LAN cable into like the thing that
00:40:15 comes out of the wall so I can have wired boosted internet that's not actually connected to the
00:40:22 router but I don't know too much about it I don't know whether that's a specific brand that's able
00:40:29 to do that or I don't know I thought I thought the internet I guess at my last place was bad
00:40:37 this place is like at least as bad so that's disappointing yeah what were we talking about
00:40:46 before we got on that subject streaming Clarissa oh yeah yeah yeah I guess I was just talking about
00:40:55 stuff that I was doing uh that was it I was yeah Clarissa
00:41:04 oh I did those commissions you know I only got three commissions when I when I had that thing
00:41:10 I did them like immediately and I was like okay I'm on top of things and I got no more so if I'm
00:41:16 still they're still open because I have you know the time I can I can you know nestle them away
00:41:23 as long as I don't get like 50 and I don't expect to judging by the response
00:41:29 so like one or two more I can do so go to Twitter if that still exists and see my commission thing
00:41:36 it's still pinned at the top of my page yeah go to youtube.com slash ben saint slash megaman lecture
00:41:51 to and check to see how many views it's got and if I if should I be embarrassed of myself
00:42:00 or not well every journey every youtube video starts with a single view a single view a single view
00:42:08 and that's your own the uploaders when you're checking it I see I think that video is probably
00:42:15 going to accrue views like steadily over like a long period of time it's I don't think it's
00:42:23 going to be like a smash like hit out the gate but I think more people will like discover it
00:42:35 maybe it'll get a boost for the 35th anniversary later this year you know you know
00:42:40 I do know yeah that's my hope it won't solve my problems but even if it does well it won't
00:42:53 fix my life what are you fighting for what am I fighting for how does he how does he say
00:43:02 far he's kind of you know here's a here's a fact I I talk about the what am I fighting for
00:43:15 clip a bit in the lecture well there was a new running shine there was a new running shine video
00:43:20 this week that just had like the most briefest little like cutaway reference to a clip of zero
00:43:27 going no this can't be happening he didn't even he didn't even play the the what am I fighting for
00:43:33 and I realized that I'm that I'm a hack and I'm a loser and I'm not funny because that guy
00:43:39 he's so far beyond my level he doesn't even have to show the thing he's talking about we all know
00:43:44 we all know about what am I fighting for it's passé to even mention it oh you feel like yeah
00:43:50 you're bringing it up would be like um yeah then we know what we're fighting for
00:43:55 yes oh no yes exactly yes exactly it should it should it just it doesn't need to be stated
00:44:02 it it she goes it goes without saying frankly well I mean there's always the person who's never
00:44:07 seen it before god it doesn't hurt to be comprehensive in a big huge hour long hours long video on the
00:44:15 subject yeah I yeah I mean I'm sort of kidding because like I know that like sort of the whole
00:44:23 point of the video is that it's comprehensive but also it just doesn't I just don't feel very cool
00:44:31 oh no but but my mom said if I made an eight hour long mega man lecture I would be cool
00:44:39 the only thing that can make me feel cool is if it gets like a million views
00:44:46 the only the only thing that will be cool is if it does really well and I look really famous and
00:44:51 then everyone will be like well yeah this video is stupid and cringe but like it performed really
00:44:56 well so I guess the guy knows what he's doing I'm serious I'm totally serious everything I make is bad
00:45:04 by default the only the only way that I can prove the only way that I can even suggest otherwise
00:45:10 is like is if it does well in the market and then market logic trumps like you know gut intuition
00:45:17 and like feeling in your heart feeling in your heart the feeling in the heart is that this guy
00:45:26 sucks this guy's not funny uh dude I hate this video but gotta respect the view count
00:45:32 it literally yes literally yes it's my only hope
00:45:38 uh I feel completely differently I think if something's cool
00:45:42 and nobody knows about it I just feel cool that to have known about it it's like hell you know who
00:45:48 I you know who I think might suck um the uh I'm a little I'm not saying this for sure but I'm a
00:45:57 little I'm a little sussed I'm a little sussed by the umami guy the guy who makes that clown cartoon
00:46:04 uh clown I don't know I think he might be a crypto head like Elon musk fan who I don't know who umami
00:46:13 um um here you will recognize the character uh let me just get an image here for you
00:46:27 yes yes posting now oh I think I've seen like the first like video in this series or whatever
00:46:41 with the weirdo I've seen a bunch of them yes I think I think he might be like an NFT Elon guy
00:46:49 well yeah don't we're not gonna ruin my day I'm not I'm not I have to find that a bit disappointing
00:46:58 because this guy this guy makes pretty cool this guy makes pretty cool videos that are awesome
00:47:07 I don't know this is just I just I just see him I just see him liking some things on Twitter
00:47:12 that I'm like why would he like that well think he emoji no exactly um I hope I'm I hope I'm wrong
00:47:24 maybe he'll maybe he follows Elon musk ironically which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do
00:47:30 yeah I guess at this point it is very funny seeing him say anything Elon's being very funny on Twitter
00:47:38 he's he's really going for it he's having a he's having a good one
00:47:47 it's it's almost so absurd that it's not even worth talking about it's like yeah of course
00:47:52 there there he goes again posting a soyjack meme posting a like an obvious cope post yeah
00:47:59 some obvious cope like 2008 like reddit meme tier thing about like the blue haired Twitter
00:48:07 sjw's won't pay $8 cringe you're right I won't what are you gonna do about it you're you're right
00:48:16 actually uh you know I you know I was I thought it was dumb because obviously I'm not paying $8
00:48:28 for Twitter but and and I hate to say this maybe it's actually good because
00:48:39 I won't I won't pay for Twitter but other people might and if other people do and it makes Twitter
00:48:45 work fine then it's like okay other people are shouldering the burden that I don't have to
00:48:52 but no that's not that's not good it's that's not good if it like throttles the views and like
00:48:57 no yeah makes it uneven so never mind it's bad it's it's it's so it's one thing if it was like
00:49:04 there was a tip jar and you could donate to Twitter to keep it afloat like how Wikipedia works
00:49:10 that doesn't compromise the utility of the platform yeah just keeps it online and that's
00:49:16 that's sort of fine it's the it's the it's the way he's trying to entice people to do it by giving
00:49:23 them all of these things that make them like like uh what's the word like more equal than
00:49:31 everyone else yeah it's like yes that's stupid it's like it's like look at all look at all these
00:49:38 perks you get if you guys buy twitter blue you'll have you'll have priority tweets like that's
00:49:44 great right don't you want more perks for your purchase and like no I want there to be fewer
00:49:50 perks I want everyone to have the same amount of perks which is zero like uh I think he was talking
00:49:58 in like a uh uh investors thing about like the idea of like long-form video on twitter if you pay
00:50:07 um genius and like streaming and podcasts but on twitter like people are going to stop using like
00:50:16 these other platforms like youtube twitch and Spotify to put their stuff on twitter
00:50:22 where they have to pay for the privilege to do that where whereas like the other places you
00:50:27 don't really have to do that at all at least with spot I think you have to pay for Spotify
00:50:33 but not on youtube on twitch tremendous tremendous what what a what a concept he's gonna he's gonna
00:50:42 build x the everything app just like just like just like dr. light he's gonna he's gonna spend the
00:50:48 last years of his life you know on his ultimate creation x which will be an app that has free will
00:50:53 and can decide for itself right from wrong uh been waiting to make that joke it's a good one
00:51:05 thanks uh I think it's I think it's got legs um anyway uh yeah he's just like ooh what what
00:51:15 what functions what what new weird stupid things can we make twitter do and it's like twitter already
00:51:19 does what we want it to do which is a little place to post like short snippets and pictures
00:51:27 snippets and pictures and bits I follow a lot of people who do comedy they just make funny tweets
00:51:34 I'm like haha it's just that some of them are a hit and miss the fact that that it's just sort of
00:51:40 like so easy to like just make a bunch of jokes it's like I'm gonna stand up the the the trend of uh
00:51:50 the trend of people uh getting verified and then uh changing their name to elon musk oh yeah
00:51:58 has been very good I've seen so is that active like that the pay for eight bucks is that already
00:52:04 active I saw emails about it I think so I think it might have happened already um I'm not sure though
00:52:14 so you can just buy the thing get the checkmark change your name in profile picture and just
00:52:20 say something like haha pee pee poo poo I I dump in my diaper I meal on musk and then you get
00:52:25 immediately terminated and then you get 10 000 followers of people that think you're the real
00:52:30 elon musk is like elon send me doge please uh did you see it how's going doing I don't know who
00:52:41 cares let's let's I care I want to see it go down it is doing I mean it's just hovering around 20k
00:52:49 as it's been for a while never mind have you seen um the the firings at twitter he sort of oh he
00:52:59 fired them based on the number of words they written and he kept the ones that wrote the most
00:53:05 in the coding that's so smart which which means that the the the the most inefficient coders
00:53:14 the ones who needed to write tons and tons of lines of code to get something to work
00:53:18 are the ones he kept and all the ones who were efficient and were able to do things smaller
00:53:24 were let go the exact opposite of what should have how do you how do you come up with such a
00:53:30 fucking boneheaded scheme I don't know I don't know why he thought I mean I thought he would know
00:53:37 I mean I would say I would yeah it's possible that maybe the least efficient ones would have
00:53:43 written the most I would say at at best there's just like just no correlation yeah yeah like it
00:53:52 depends on what tasks you have to do and like what jobs you're a part of that the amount of
00:54:00 code you write would differ yeah it's just sort of I mean I guess that that's that's really what
00:54:08 happened he just fired like half the staff just based on like how many words or lines of code or
00:54:14 whatever I heard it was lines of code maybe it was more rigorous than that but knowing Elon it
00:54:20 probably wouldn't have been that much more rigorous I half of them are gone half of there's like 7400
00:54:27 people that work there and that half of them have been fired that's very smart uh I have to be honest
00:54:37 I don't really care that much about the individual employees of Twitter my heart does not exactly
00:54:45 bleed for them just because they got fired like boo-hoo whatever everyone gets fired deal with it
00:54:51 yeah that's not but it does but it is dumb it's it's obviously like a dumb way to manage your
00:54:56 business it doesn't make any sense I mean it's it's the way it reads to me is that he's like
00:55:03 he's so fucked and he's like that Twitter loses so much money all the time because of how many
00:55:09 employees we have and how much money is not coming in oh god please pay for Twitter blue
00:55:15 like we gotta get rid of so mostly stuff just get can't pay all these salaries oh my god
00:55:20 I'm $44 billion in the red or whatever what a freaking idiot what a freaking nerd it's so it's
00:55:29 so funny I mean I I guess part of me will feel a little bad if like it does end up just like
00:55:36 making Twitter unusable sure yeah so I hope it doesn't come to that I hope it just doesn't do
00:55:43 anything uh who just gives up but he probably won't yeah I don't know like people have speculated
00:55:51 a lot of different things people are saying that he's going to eventually just sell it at a loss
00:55:57 to someone yeah because he can't like he's but like $44 billion like nobody's gonna pay even
00:56:06 anywhere close to that for Twitter no no I mean it was so it's gonna be a huge loss so like it was
00:56:13 try his best to get like the $8 a month thing going Elon simps will do it maybe normal people will
00:56:21 think fine I guess and then they'll do it as well but in the long term I don't think that's gonna be
00:56:27 that sustainable I just I just don't know uh I mean
00:56:35 I guess I guess we'll see no I mean it the the wasn't like the original amount just like a meme
00:56:44 offer like he just offered like ha ha for $420 or whatever per share per share oh yeah it was
00:56:53 like oh it was like he made he made enough he made you know it was literally like he was like
00:56:58 lol I'll buy Twitter at like $69 per share Lamar or something and they and then he just like
00:57:06 played chicken with that and then he meant it until he eventually was legally obligated to
00:57:12 have meant it the whole time so like yeah it's definitely a huge loss and it was always going to
00:57:18 be like I don't really remember like the announcement at the initially of like haha I'll buy Twitter
00:57:25 um I have so much money like that's vaguely what I remember it but like I read I read some
00:57:31 some some think pieces about it what was his what was his thought process behind even making the joke
00:57:38 it's that he was just complaining about like Twitter's bad there's too many bots
00:57:43 Twitter's not profitable I could run Twitter better than this
00:57:46 but basically just that I wonder if he was like you know he found this really hot person on Twitter
00:57:56 and he was like DMing them but it was a bot it was a sex bot and he was like fuck my wife left me
00:58:02 and I want to have sex this sucks Twitter still has too many bots I keep going up in there and I
00:58:08 find bots fuck it I'll buy the whole thing and then get rid of the bots so I can find hot uh
00:58:15 desperate mills in my area the yeah the uh the the bots thing was like big that was like a big
00:58:23 part of the thing like he claimed that like Twitter was being dishonest about like the
00:58:28 number of bots that like have accounts on there that that was his initial way to try and get out
00:58:35 of it which leads me to believe that he was like already stuck it was part of his original
00:58:40 complaints about Twitter and yeah then also when he was trying to back out he's like no no they lie
00:58:44 they lied about how many bots they have there's there's more bots than I was led to believe
00:58:48 like how did he let it even though like his initial reason for buying the platform
00:58:52 was that what part of it was that like there are too many bots and I want to solve the bot problem
00:58:58 and then they're like well okay now you have to buy it and he's like no no I can't buy it
00:59:03 I didn't know there were all these bots
00:59:07 like how did he how did he let it get to the point where he had to start making excuses in
00:59:11 order to back out and it didn't even work what did he sign what yeah I don't know like yeah why would
00:59:21 you be why would you sign stuff there must yeah there there was like actual documentation there's
00:59:29 like there was at some point illegal obligation and he just went like lol
00:59:37 which is pretty funny I guess
00:59:42 broken man it's really it's just really funny how like Elon simps are like
00:59:48 lol he owned them he really bought it he owns twitter now and it's like yeah
00:59:53 he really bought it for like five times what it's worth because he like way more than five times
00:59:59 yeah because he like couldn't not do it he didn't want to do it but he had to so like he really
01:00:05 truly who owned who here I genuinely don't understand he played himself completely and utterly
01:00:12 yeah the the the the the Elon I don't understand the Elon is playing 5d chess people
01:00:20 truly it kind of not not to not to really compare them because they're not that similar but it sort
01:00:26 of reminds me of the people in Maryweather's comments who were like angry at someone suggesting
01:00:32 a gender swap and then when he did the gender swap they said like he owned them he owned them by
01:00:39 giving them exactly what they asked for like ah he owned the haters what are you talking about
01:00:48 boy oh boy do not make fun of my idol I tie my self-worth to this man
01:00:55 I mean a lot of people it's a lot of it is people that have like financial
01:01:02 stake like they own share in Tesla or they own bitcoin or they own doge and those people I mean
01:01:08 I don't agree with them but I at least understand that like I have a financial stake in this man's
01:01:13 reputation as like a wildcard genius or whatever I at least understand the motivation for those people
01:01:25 oh yeah yeah hi yeah yeah how was your halloween
01:01:34 oh my halloween was pretty all right I just uh I was just hung out with um
01:01:41 munchie kazzie jones and uh I think that was it and uh we watched um we watched a movie called
01:01:51 The Ritual that was not particularly good it was okay that's good that's nice yeah but you know what
01:02:03 it wasn't that it wasn't that spooky it didn't it didn't it didn't spook me too bad the way that
01:02:08 like Midsommar did so it was all right um I made gummy worms I made like halloween gummy worms but
01:02:16 I made like way too many of them you made like piles I mean I left them at their place so they
01:02:25 still have like piles yeah I made like a big bowl of them and like they already had food so like
01:02:34 you know a pretty limited amount got eaten you know oh well I just I discovered something I discovered
01:02:44 hack I was making those halloween gummies and I made a couple different flavors I made black cherry
01:02:50 and I made orange and then I made lime and the lime ones came out much softer and I liked I didn't
01:02:59 like them as much I like the the tougher chewier ones and the difference was and I think this is
01:03:04 what made that they had the exact same ingredients the exact same amounts of everything in them
01:03:09 the difference was that the black cherry and the orange I had microwaved because you have to
01:03:15 combine the ingredients and then you have to microwave them and get them hot to like melt
01:03:18 melt it all together I had microwaved those in a much bigger vessel because you put it in this
01:03:24 vessel and then you put it in the microwave and then boils and the bubbles rise to the top and then
01:03:29 you let it cool off uh the the lime ones I had cooked in a small container because I had only
01:03:36 made half as much so it had only bubbled a little bit the other ones I had made in a big
01:03:40 vessel and it bubbled a lot and I think one just cooked more water off uh and led to them being
01:03:46 denser and chewier so that made me think like damn there's really like to get like a really
01:03:51 consistent result you you literally have to control for like how much how much do you not not just
01:03:58 like what temperature but like how long do you do you heat it to that temperature because like the
01:04:03 amount of boiling makes a noticeable difference I wonder how you could like could you like um
01:04:12 weigh it before and after to get to to know exactly how much water is has been lost you know
01:04:19 you probably could yeah yeah you probably could that's uh that that's that's something that I've
01:04:26 sort of been meaning to do is like I sort of have the recipe memorized in terms of like
01:04:32 tablespoons I would kind of like to convert that at some point to like milligrams so that I can
01:04:39 have like a more precise like yeah it'd be more it's more more precise that way because a tablespoon
01:04:46 is a little bit you know you can buy different measuring tablespoons and like they're not all
01:04:51 exactly the same they're a little bit they're a little bit sloppy a little bit rough
01:04:55 yeah I'm getting hungry have an eating today maybe I'll go make some after this podcast is over
01:05:04 hell yeah the one thing the one thing that I still value in this world the one thing that'll never
01:05:10 let me down this gummies my my gummy worms will never abandon me like unlike everyone else would
01:05:20 you still love me if I turned into a gummy worm would you would you still love I would love you
01:05:24 significantly more if you were a gummy worm actually
01:05:31 I got Heidi Klum's worm costume I did it was pretty neat that was a crazy looks like bacon
01:05:40 looks like it's a little bit strips of bacon over the face just fucking lying on the ground talking
01:05:46 about it hmm you were no no I assume I'm thinking of the same thing you're thinking about like somebody
01:05:56 was interviewing her she was writhing on the floor oh I didn't see that I saw her like walking on
01:06:02 like the red carpet yeah yeah I saw her like dancing behind like a DJ's table this fucking worm
01:06:10 costume pretty great honestly yeah it was really convincing that she like
01:06:16 did the the whole like makeup around her face so that it doesn't like it doesn't feel separate
01:06:23 I'm gonna say that that worm costume was really it was very much like in line with the zeitgeist
01:06:30 it's just like exactly what 2022 needed it was a real a real hit it fit the time so I mean good job
01:06:39 I'm proud of her oh um there was a uh new new got me his last page by the way
01:06:48 oh hell yeah yeah so um yeah news news chapter is done and I think that means that all that's
01:06:58 missing are that one page that I think simsie is not doing anymore so maybe I'll just maybe
01:07:05 maybe I'll just ask kaiju if he wants to because kaiju was asking me for more pages but I gotta
01:07:11 get on kaiju's ass because I haven't heard from him in a while he said he was gonna draw the cover
01:07:15 and like one other page so maybe I'll give him like another one or two on top of that
01:07:23 and then that and then that's like done yep although I see I see just today
01:07:29 munchy message Nate literally half an hour ago I was wondering about this too because Nate had
01:07:35 showed us the timeline for the project had started and I haven't heard anything from him in a month
01:07:41 yes he said he was working on a thing and now he's made a video which has just come out which I
01:07:47 assume is what he was working on um so he means like it was like a stream right did he make like
01:07:55 a real video he put a video on where he's talking with Sekiro footage about one piece
01:08:01 scanlation stuff hmm okay so I assume that's his project maybe it's not but well I hope you said
01:08:08 he would focus on the the OVA I mean he said he yeah I mean he said he was gonna finish what he
01:08:14 was working on a month and a half ago and then focus on the OVA so I don't know I mean I okay well
01:08:24 I guess maybe that was it and he just said that it was done but he he I whatever I hope he fucking
01:08:34 does it yeah we just gotta add like 40 months 50 months frustrating because because because back
01:08:47 when we initially talked about it he said oh maybe I'll have it done in six months and we were all
01:08:51 like it should not take six months but like I think it's like been six months yeah and he still
01:08:57 has doesn't have it done even though we all said that we should act we should accelerate the pace
01:09:02 faster than that maybe it hasn't maybe it hasn't been six months I think it's been no it's only been
01:09:10 like two or two and a half or three maybe three months since he said six months
01:09:19 still it's just still yeah um whatever I hope I hope Nate gets back to uh you know what I'll
01:09:30 I'll post a little message in there I'll agree and then I'll say yeah what's up and that will let
01:09:34 everyone know that I'm on the side of good and not evil hey just see that new uh is it a new
01:09:42 Jenny Nicholson video uh I did not what's it about it is about a weird theme park it is about the
01:09:54 history and the bizarre operations of a theme park called evermore uh it's pretty good I name
01:10:06 dropped Jenny Nicholson in the mega man lecture video and uh I hope nobody uh holds that against
01:10:14 me and makes fun of me for it I hope she sees this bro um I mean she probably won't
01:10:26 it's okay whatever it's not really it's not for her it's for mega it is it's for mega it's for
01:10:35 it's for my boy mega man shout out to mega man shout out to mega man gotta be gotta be one of my
01:10:42 favorite genders shout shout outs to reploids no it's not no it doesn't work no it doesn't work
01:10:50 what's a reploid I forget I think you've told me before what's a reploid um if only there's a
01:10:57 lecture I could find out if only god you you need to fucking be lectured about it for eight hours
01:11:02 if you don't know what a reploid is it's a reploid is um it's x is the first reploid reploids are the
01:11:09 robots from x series the ones with free will uh so do you know the do you know the difference
01:11:18 between mega man and x I do so mega man doesn't have free will no it's just being controlled
01:11:25 by a player character with a control let me tell let me tell you a funny story uh in mega man seven
01:11:33 uh there's a part where at the end you beat wily and wily's like sorry mega man looks like you
01:11:41 beat me and mega man says I'm sick of this I'm killing you I'm killing you right now and wily's
01:11:49 like what you're gonna you're I'm sorry you're gonna do what huh and uh in English in English
01:11:56 well wily says a robot can't kill a human and and mega man says well in in Japanese he doesn't say
01:12:03 anything in English he says and this is a famous line I am more than a robot die wily yes I've seen
01:12:11 that before yes but he doesn't shoot he doesn't shoot and uh I talk about this in the lecture
01:12:18 obviously but in my opinion uh his line implies that he can do it but the fact that he doesn't do
01:12:26 it means that like he's wrong like he thinks he has he thinks he can do it but he can he thinks he
01:12:31 can go against his programming but he can't but yeah yeah uh in Japanese he's just kind of like
01:12:39 dot dot dot which reads to me like you know frustrated acceptance that yeah wily is right I
01:12:46 can't do it no the robots and mega man they like they have they have personalities
01:12:57 and stuff they have like human intelligence but if they're programmed to do something they have to
01:13:03 do it and it might even be that like they have to like obey commands so it might be that like if
01:13:12 wily tells like if wily tells metal man like come here bow to me right now give me tribute metal
01:13:21 man he's like simply must immediately obey because like he can't go against the will of his uh his
01:13:28 creator is it the creator or is it was it just humans uh it might be it's it's sort of the thing
01:13:37 about like that like the the Isaac azimov like rules for robotics or is it different in English
01:13:43 wily seems to specifically be referencing the uh the Isaac azimov rules of robotics in Japanese
01:13:50 he's not he just kind of says that like a robot just can't disobey a human yeah it might it might
01:13:58 be the case that like mega man robots just simply all obey any command that a human gives them
01:14:06 and they can't harm humans they cannot they cannot harm humans except is dr wily allowing them to
01:14:14 do that that's why they're trash in the place uh there's i mean there's no there's no point in
01:14:21 the games where like it's like uh oh wily has made a robot that can hurt humans uh so it seems to me
01:14:30 that it's all of the violence is robot on robot uh yeah so all the humans are just chilling while
01:14:39 like robots are punching each other yeah yeah like they're humans are just like doing living their
01:14:45 lives or whatever and meanwhile over in the old over in the old you know car factory or whatever
01:14:50 the robots are like going going haywire like blasting each other into into molten scrap
01:14:57 and humans just like oof well if i'll just i'll just leave them to it i guess like what
01:15:03 cars are gonna what do i care whether like you know whether wily's like robot uprising like
01:15:09 whether he takes control of the old bean factory or not like who do i care which rich industrialist
01:15:14 ends up owning these uh these mech these mechanized facilities well if the mechanized facilities are
01:15:21 being bombed and shot with like things are going to rip in the wires out then the factory's gonna
01:15:28 be at a commission and i'm not gonna be able to get my latte oh no prices prices are going up
01:15:36 i can't believe these prices and values uh yeah i i think that like i think wily's robots they
01:15:46 they wreak havoc and they do destruction but i'm pretty sure they don't like kill people
01:15:52 even like gremlins in in x uh i mean reploids reploids are basically human they just don't
01:15:59 have like you know blood uh and like reploids die in x but humans never do like they're just
01:16:05 simply like aren't any humans around anywhere in in x except for dr kane he's like literally the only
01:16:12 one and then he stops showing up in x4 i suppose it's a smart too because like it's a it's a cutesy
01:16:23 looking robot series for kids mostly you can't really have humans dying a lot so you just don't
01:16:30 show them yeah i think they they use they use the fact that like this is a story about robots
01:16:41 to be like well we can have that we can have them die and and they can kill each other yeah
01:16:48 like it can be like really dramatic but for babies and and yeah but it's little kids and that makes
01:16:54 them cry we can get it we can get away with more with more uh grim dark violence a little bit
01:17:01 because like technically they're not human they don't have blood or whatever if bambi was a robot
01:17:07 they would actually show the bullet entering it wouldn't just be off screen oh bambi's mom i
01:17:15 should say bambi's mom was a robot but bambi's normal and then in uh and then in zero like they
01:17:21 just give the reploids blood anyway uh you know i didn't even mention damn it i could have mentioned
01:17:29 that as like another thing that like reploids are more are more human like in zero yeah they
01:17:33 literally bleed blood do they have to like add the blood from like a blood bank it might not
01:17:42 literally be blood it's just like when you slice one with your with your z saber a big like geyser
01:17:47 of red fluid like spurts out it's just uh it's like chili oil um um delicious uh yeah zero has the
01:18:01 cool um anytime when you kill like anything with your z saber it like it has like a custom
01:18:06 sprite where like its body is like split in half and like you can sort of see it's like
01:18:10 red robot innards like along the like the split line and it like falls in two pieces it rules uh
01:18:19 uh
01:18:26 that's it that's all i got that's it watch the my fucking video please okay thanks
01:18:38 oh man i i don't know if i'm i hope there's no more errors in it i mean i found those errors
01:18:46 going through it you know adding the uh the timestamps there i mean it's possible that
01:18:52 there are some that i missed but i mean how many times can i how many times can i watch through
01:19:00 the video looking for more and more errors like it there comes a point where i just have to be like
01:19:07 i can't i can't i can double check and triple check and quadruple check but like is a quintuple
01:19:12 check like just too much am i is it just a diminishing returns at that point i think as
01:19:19 long as you can hear your voice yeah um and it you know you didn't like accidentally cut like a
01:19:28 five minute thing completely out and it's just black video of no no audio as long as it's like
01:19:35 functional as a video i don't think you need to worry too much yeah there there i had thought that
01:19:42 i had already watched it through and like noted down every error that i found and went in and
01:19:47 fixed all the errors so like i kind of i like already had double and triple checked it and then
01:19:52 just in doing the uh timestamping i just discovered like oh some new error was introduced at some point
01:20:01 bummer yeah it's it's kind of a difficult thing because like if you've got like
01:20:07 tons of different layers and such a long timeline and you move stuff and you don't move
01:20:14 everything like every time you go in to change something there's a chance that you'll create a
01:20:19 new error that you'll not know about until you're watching it for the next time yeah and like um
01:20:26 i'd really i just tried to be really careful and like make sure that i was like carefully
01:20:30 selecting everything and like nothing was not getting moved and just i tried to move everything
01:20:35 in like as big chunks as possible to avoid like some small part getting getting knocked out of
01:20:42 whack uh i mean i think it i think it was fine it should be all right the the the worst errors
01:20:50 that i found were there were there was one little bit it only lasted like a few seconds
01:20:56 where like it cut to black in between cuts and there were a few times when there like a clip
01:21:03 would be like cut off a little bit early or a clip would fade into the next clip when it was
01:21:10 supposed to be a cut there were a handful of those and those and those are like not even
01:21:15 very concerning like you almost wouldn't even notice those if you weren't paying attention
01:21:20 so if there's a couple more of those like i don't even really care no but there's um
01:21:27 every every time every time that i like pause the video and i have myself play
01:21:34 in an audio clip where i recorded a line like clarifying something i had the flash stopper
01:21:41 sound effect and visual effects start playing over the footage and the problem was that for the
01:21:47 first like three and a half hours the the sound would play at the right time but the visual effect
01:21:54 would start about it would start about 10 seconds early and it would end about 10 seconds early
01:21:59 and it just looked i mean it just looked wrong uh yeah so i guess just like part of that one
01:22:09 layer that that one effect was on just got jostled
01:22:15 and that's how that's that's how that's how it happened probably
01:22:23 damn that's that's the way the cookie rumbles true damn we're only an hour we're only only an
01:22:30 hour and a half in and i feel like i've run out of things to say oh just like just like talking to
01:22:38 just like talking to john just doesn't got nothing to say of my life empty void void void void
01:22:48 void void um there's not even any like juicy tricksy drama to be upset about
01:22:59 damn now what what without that what do i have
01:23:03 yeah you gotta you gotta manufacture some yes yes
01:23:13 what devilish plan is cooking in ben sainte's head
01:23:18 what if i went to her house and lit fire to him
01:23:24 the drama is the ben sainte's in prison
01:23:27 yeah uh
01:23:32 yeah i don't know i uh i guess i don't have too much to talk about
01:23:37 i was just i was just having a week it was very good week i was very happy
01:23:43 feeling very gay right now feeling very like homosexual that's that's that's fun
01:23:48 hmm all right all right i'm feel i'm feeling yeah i'm feeling yeah uh
01:23:57 do you want to go do you want to uh explain more uh i don't know okay i don't know if i want to
01:24:05 explain more about that um i talked about the gig last time didn't i it was the any other thing
01:24:12 that was happening you did talk about the gig i'll i'll just tell you all right
01:24:18 if you'll i i think i know what you're talking about but i won't say it but uh i think you did
01:24:23 talk about it on your on your paid money spenders podcast right yeah right yeah you seemed yeah yeah
01:24:30 i saw you you announced the money spenders podcast and i said i think i know i think i know what's
01:24:35 yep patreon.com slash give and take
01:24:40 yeah uh do not do not watch the mega man lecture listen to gib's money spenders
01:24:47 podcast yeah you can only do one or the other yes one is like 45 minutes right but it's such a
01:24:56 roller coaster i haven't listened to it actually um buh yeah it's it's uh it's um yeah you know it's uh
01:25:11 i don't know i don't know how to approach the subject on the pcp uh i guess i i yeah i get you
01:25:17 yeah it's private it's private and that's why it's on the money spenders podcast go there if you
01:25:22 want to learn about that um not a great pitch because you no idea what it is but that's fine
01:25:30 yeah i mean it seems reasonable to me um well i'm trying to scrape the bottom of the barrel
01:25:38 of any uh thoughts that i had this week or uh new new shit going on and there's just not
01:25:45 anything yeah the biggest thing has been elon and the twitter stuff yeah which i have kind of
01:25:53 i have not been posting much on twitter and i think i should keep it that way
01:26:00 uh i will i will post a um oh um a teaser announcement when the when the lecture is
01:26:06 out i will i will make a little post about that but other than that i don't really want to be
01:26:09 on there much anymore uh inscription soli got me inscription as well who did so uh soli i think
01:26:19 solis oh solaru solaru there's many names they go by right right right um
01:26:27 yeah i played that for a bit i don't think i don't think i have gotten to
01:26:30 like the big twist but i've died twice and i think i get the gist um there's there's like
01:26:40 room to talk about it i would love to hear how far you've gotten and what you think about it
01:26:47 well um i i enjoyed my first run i felt like i was pretty smart um using the using the things
01:26:58 getting the getting the wins dodging the bad things and i died it's like you know you you
01:27:07 you have little animals and they do damage and i have health and you can block enemies
01:27:13 and some of the enemies can fly over you and hit your life points like in yugio
01:27:20 well it's more like magically gathering it's more like everything yeah
01:27:29 and i'm like okay cool you have you have to sacrifice your little little guys to
01:27:36 to get blood that you use to put down a big guy there's a wolf he has two blood
01:27:45 and so uh the the the thing of like drawing from your hands your deck or getting a squirrel
01:27:51 which costs nothing to put down but can be sacrificed to get one blood is sort of like
01:27:58 it's a that's a that's a cool choice that's a cool dynamic because like you're guaranteed
01:28:03 something or if you get a secret mystery prize that you already know what it could be
01:28:09 yeah and you build your deck as you go yeah yeah uh there's items and things and it's like the
01:28:16 squirrel can this this like do you need to pay for something well then you got to get the squirrel
01:28:22 but like what if you the stuff in your hand is too expensive maybe you'd be better off drawing for
01:28:27 like a less expensive creature card like something that costs one yeah or maybe you just need a
01:28:34 chump blocker maybe you just need a squirrel for a chump to block and attack this round or something
01:28:40 and you might as well just use a squirrel for that because you don't want to sacrifice like a real
01:28:43 creature yeah yeah so yeah um it's got a nice level of of uh our consideration thought process
01:28:56 what's the word i'm looking for you have to think a bit and it's not totally down to what card you
01:29:01 draw you before you draw a card you make a choice and i like that yeah um
01:29:08 strategy strategy uh and then i got to the angler i beat the first uh first boss on my first try
01:29:17 and i was like hell yeah prospector mule got him uh i got all the way to the angler and then i didn't
01:29:25 really have any good cards and i died and then okay then the guys he grabbed me and i know that you
01:29:35 could i knew that you could get up off the table and walk around a bit and there's like yeah there's
01:29:40 like puzzle you hadn't really done that i had done that because he asked you to get the candlestick
01:29:46 or something wait wait that was your first run you made it to the angler yeah hmm i enjoyed
01:29:53 further than i made it yeah i felt like i was doing pretty well because after the first boss he
01:29:58 gives you two health i think i'd lost one health um or one life yeah and uh yeah he restores your uh
01:30:07 your candles yeah so that was fun he makes you go and like get the candle off the the the table
01:30:13 right he's like go get yeah go get the candle you can walk around and i saw that there was a
01:30:19 clock you could fiddle with i saw there was a globe that you could spin other little things you
01:30:23 could click on couldn't do much but i'm like okay so there's puzzles here um yes and then i lost at
01:30:30 the angler and he dragged me away and this is the first death so it's like it's not too much of a
01:30:37 spoiler but he takes out a camera he takes your picture or before that he asked you to make a card
01:30:43 your own death card mm-hmm and so based on the cards you've picked up you have to choose like the
01:30:50 cost and the power and lucky for me i managed to get like a zero cost um and like two three
01:30:58 because i had the wolf so zero cost two three um what what was the zero cost uh i think it was
01:31:06 zero cost card the zero cost was i think i can't remember what it was maybe it was the geck
01:31:14 some it was something that's really small that i could use as the cost of the thing
01:31:19 the yeah it might have been the geck the geck is a is a free card yeah so and then it says
01:31:25 write your name it's like okay it's gib and so i became a card he took my picture and i found
01:31:32 my card in the next playthrough and he's he talks to you like you're someone else so i'm like okay i
01:31:38 see how it is uh you play the game and if you lose you become a card and some of the other cards
01:31:44 talk to you so they presumably have lost the game before and they're trapped you mean um is it is it
01:31:50 stote stote and uh the stote so the author and and the stink bug there's the two i found i found
01:31:57 the stink bug you know you know in the safe because i figured out you can look in the book
01:32:02 you see the safe thing it's like oh hell right right yeah so i'm like that's that's basically
01:32:08 where i am i died again okay and i don't remember what else happened you just took my picture again
01:32:16 but then there was a new thing there was totems and there was bones and i'm like okay you're adding
01:32:21 new gameplay mechanics every time i die so i guess i have to die a lot or something oh right
01:32:27 yeah it doesn't you start out not knowing about bones yep so uh yeah i guess i i just sort of
01:32:35 have to play a lot what the what the what totem did you get i got a squirrel and it did you find it
01:32:45 on a on a table or something i don't remember i did the thing where you go to the little
01:32:52 cabinet and you do that puzzle where you have to like make the thing the counter go to five
01:33:00 and then you can open the drawer yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i figured all those out and i was like
01:33:06 i'm smart yeah and i got all the things from the drawer and uh i don't think i
01:33:14 i think after my second death he says now you will create your own totem
01:33:19 choose the face of the totem uh or something and i made a squirrel that turns when the squirrel dies
01:33:27 it turns into a bee and it goes into my hand i was like okay oh the beehive you gave it the
01:33:34 beehive sigil yeah i think i see which was a bad idea because i want to sacrifice squirrels but if
01:33:40 you sacrifice them they don't turn into bees they have to die so that was the stupidest it's yeah
01:33:45 yeah the the bee the bee happens when they get hit yeah not when they die so yeah that's actually a
01:33:50 pretty that's actually pretty bad synergy although it it would be good if it made a bee when they died
01:33:56 yes um yeah so that i think i stopped there because i was like a little tired um i do want to play
01:34:04 more i do want to find out like like more of a story because like inscription it's like he's
01:34:13 inscribing your name onto the cards and it's like i i noticed that you cannot as far as i know
01:34:22 you open up the game there's a guy who says okay let's see what this is all about and it's like
01:34:26 playing on a crt screen some guy's voice so somebody you're playing a game wherein somebody's
01:34:32 playing a game diegetically and you can't click new game you can only click continue game even though
01:34:40 it is the beginning and there is no like that you click that really that really like frustrated me
01:34:46 at the start it's like why is the i should have been more obvious that like okay this is sort of
01:34:52 meant to be this way but yeah i was a little i was a little confused wrong here like i did think
01:34:58 something was wrong i asked uh i asked steve and he said uh no that's normal so i'm okay so i'm like
01:35:07 yeah you can get you can make some busted busted death cards yeah i i think the i don't know yet
01:35:19 because i haven't played through my second life whether or not both of my death cards are like
01:35:26 attainable maybe it's just the most the the most recent one um but like they're all they're all
01:35:32 floating around okay they all stick around okay so that's yeah so like the better cards you get
01:35:38 the more more powerful you can make some of them with the the sacrificing and the and the putting
01:35:46 around the campfire and stuff um like the more powerful cards you might have at the end that
01:35:52 you can attribute to your death card and then that can be as a useful progress for later you
01:35:59 can build up an advantage over time over deaths so i'm like okay that's that's neat i suppose
01:36:07 yeah i managed i think on like one of my first runs i managed to make like like a free basically
01:36:12 like a free grizzly bear or something like a free four six and it's that's just yeah that's just so
01:36:18 busted it's so busted but the annoying thing is that it's also a card game so yeah you might not
01:36:26 pick it up before you die and i'm like well yeah i still i still lost i still lost even though uh
01:36:33 even though i had that card available because like you know it might not be available at the right
01:36:38 time i had i lost a lot on the on the the the the thing after the uh the angler uh me personally
01:36:50 so uh i i just didn't um the the ang the angler is a little the angler is a little tough although
01:37:01 what did you did you lose on the angler i did yeah okay so i there's there's sort of a way to kind
01:37:08 of solve him yeah i mean i i think i figured it out i think the second time i died was again at
01:37:14 the angler and i'm like okay so he's gonna take one card every so often i have to and whenever i
01:37:22 put a card down he changes to that card so as long as i can put down a card that becomes useless on
01:37:27 his side of the board that'll fill up his side of the board with useless cards but then i will need
01:37:33 to fight through them in order to hit them so i probably need a bird and i didn't have a bird at
01:37:39 time and also fliers are helpful against the angler definitely and so i'm like okay my i don't
01:37:47 have a good deck but also i don't have anything to defend myself and i can't really play anything
01:37:52 because i had two like my my hand was full of things that were too expensive so i had to
01:37:57 keep drawing squirrels and i just lost so i might fuck it and my deck is bad and i hate roguelikes
01:38:04 i'm i'm a little disappointed that uh you have not made it further because there are
01:38:12 just quite a few things that i can't mention uh but uh so i'm trying limiting limiting myself
01:38:22 to non non spoiler talk is a bit is a bit tricky uh but i mean you know you want to you've been
01:38:29 playing like the actual like card game card game yeah and like it's good it's a good uh
01:38:36 it's a good game the to the totems can be really uh at some point i got a um
01:38:43 you know like the the three blood drops you ever had the you ever had the goat
01:38:49 i i want i got the goat in my deck and i never he never appeared i never got him i got a um yeah
01:38:56 i got that three blood sigil on my squirrel so all my squirrels sacked for three blood
01:39:01 oh my god that's that was really good the the best one i think is um have you found the cockroach
01:39:10 i think so i didn't i don't think i chose him when i saw him the cockroach is he's all right
01:39:16 his sigil is really good if you can get him on on another creature uh the one that's just like
01:39:22 when it dies it comes back to your hand uh if you could like if you can get that on your squirrels
01:39:27 like you just you just win uh because like it means you can just you can just reuse your squirrels
01:39:34 and oh yeah well then you'd also need to make sure you have like high blood cost powerful beasts
01:39:40 available to you actually put down yeah i mean preferably also um field mice give us i don't know
01:39:48 what the sigil is called but field mice gives a similar sigil that's like when you play it a copy
01:39:53 of it appears in your hand which basically turns all your squirrels into two squirrels uh which is
01:39:58 pretty good um have you uh have you i don't know have you found any any cards with sigils that you
01:40:06 particularly like um i don't know yet it's uh i like the one i guess i like the one where if you
01:40:17 sacrifice the little black cat you get near the beginning oh the cat yeah you sacrifice it he comes
01:40:22 back and so you can put him again the sacrifice uh one is that sigil is really good uh the best
01:40:31 thing is to is to sack the cat to another card to get it on like a better card that actually
01:40:37 does something yeah i think i did that the first time i like or maybe the second time i was like um
01:40:43 um confronted with the uh sacrifice combined cards thing um i'm like wait if i put this thing
01:40:53 on this thing the this thing then then it's just a straight upgrade because the thing i think i put
01:41:00 it on the geek the geek i think oh that's good something that costs zero and then it can come
01:41:07 back actually yeah that's really good because then you don't even have to pay to play it yeah
01:41:10 so i play it and i can kill it i can play it and kill it and play and kill it even just even
01:41:16 just putting it on like the stote or the toad is like um it's still good because like then instead
01:41:22 of like wasting a space of your board to just have like a sacrificeable cat uh you you actually it's
01:41:30 it's on like a it's the same cost because it's one blood and but also it's a creature that is
01:41:34 actually like doing something um yeah i have not i've put cards on the fire near the camp fire
01:41:44 i have not once had my card get eaten but it's always implied that they want to do that and
01:41:51 they almost do it but then i leave can that happen or is that just a they're like a bait and like
01:41:56 like a scary thing i i never had it happen to me like during the main game in like the in like the
01:42:04 post game challenge modes i have had it happen so it can happen i don't i don't exactly know how
01:42:10 likely it is did know there was a post game yeah there's like yeah there's like challenge modes
01:42:19 like you start with a specific deck you gotta win yeah there's different starting decks the rules
01:42:25 work a little bit differently like um you can only you can only use the fire twice you can't
01:42:31 i think you can use it up to like four times uh but i mean it's it's risky every time in the main
01:42:38 game there's like different uh there's different cards available uh some of the numbers are tweaked
01:42:44 it's called it's called kasey's mod is the the challenge modes um have you found uh have you
01:42:52 used like a mantis or a mantis god i i think on my third life this says choose your favorite
01:43:00 uh team and i chose bug and i got a mantis um i like i've seen mantis is used um you text left
01:43:09 to right yeah i didn't really get a chance to play with it though i think that's when i start
01:43:15 all my third life i was like okay well uh this isn't going well immediately because i chose
01:43:23 a bad thing for my squirrel so my totem is kind of useless
01:43:29 i um at some point at some point i realized the game like kind of mentions this too at
01:43:37 at certain points uh sometimes you want less cards some sometimes you want like there's one
01:43:44 that lets you sacrifice a card to like the lord of bones and there's one and the ones that and
01:43:50 the ones that combine two different cards into one sometimes you want to go for those
01:43:55 i mean because the combo can be good but also just because it like means less cards
01:44:00 so yeah less you can like get your weaker cards to just like you know you don't you don't have
01:44:05 them anymore because like you don't want to draw them yeah that is a thing there's only so much
01:44:09 space on the board and one card per turns like sometimes you just get three things that you
01:44:15 can't play like if you're like if you're if you're getting to like the end game and you
01:44:21 still have like an unupgraded like stote and toad like you don't even want to be like wasting
01:44:27 turns like spending a blood to play a freaking one two yeah they're just they're just gonna outpace
01:44:33 you like that a freaking one two give me a break uh well i will be uh i'll ask you more about it
01:44:43 later when you've uh when you've uh made a little more progress and uh maybe i uncovered some stuff
01:44:53 is it gonna be a skeleton so you're gonna be a skeleton at close
01:44:58 i'm not telling i'm not telling if there's a skeleton is the crazy guy who's you're playing
01:45:05 with is is it actually a mirror and you're playing with yourself
01:45:12 imagine imagine not knowing who that guy is imagine i can't it's five nights at freddy's
01:45:20 purple guy it is very it is very five nights at freddy's looking five nights freddy's looking
01:45:27 ass looking ass room i do i do like um the when he talks that low like crackly noise
01:45:39 so that's a good noise sound effect
01:45:43 the third boss has a has a like music that is like ingrained into my mind forever
01:45:52 because i heard it so much because i died so many times
01:45:56 i lost i lost a lot actually i died a lot of times uh
01:46:03 man have you uh you probably have not played any ant cards right i i think i got an ant queen
01:46:12 and an ant oh at some point and i put them down but i don't think i won well i think they didn't
01:46:18 really do anything i i didn't have like because i could tell what you want is to have
01:46:24 many ants uh to bolster all the other ants and the end of the one i think
01:46:32 in in kasey's mod one of the starting decks you unlock is like an ant deck and it's it's but
01:46:38 it's busted it's op it's like way too good i think it i think it starts you with like an ant queen
01:46:44 and an ant queen and a flying ant and like with just those cards like you play you play the ant queen
01:46:51 you get another ant in your hand or like yeah first and then you play the and then you play
01:46:57 the new the worker ants and the flying ant and suddenly you've got you've got three three power
01:47:03 cards on your side and you just win uh it's good i like i like ants
01:47:14 all right sick yep sick sick sick sick sick um we'll have to we'll have to
01:47:21 resume our inscription discussion later uh what do you think about voicemails uh yeah let's let's
01:47:29 voice let's let's voice um it looks like the first one is an it's two imager links or no
01:47:41 it's two of the same imager link for some reason uh it's ben saint bald arc at let'sgo.com breaking
01:47:55 rad wait i saw this somewhere i mean it looks good this is looks very good
01:48:02 cheesy with a cheesy what the fuck are you talking about that's really good uh this is awesome
01:48:10 mess gummy you're in your underwear with the gun the iconic i mean that is
01:48:18 is that's a look that i would have in real life i like it i like this a lot it's very
01:48:26 nice yeah thank you uh next one is called pedantic acronyms bullshit three two one go
01:48:35 so i just realized there's this big double standard on the accepted pronunciations for jiff
01:48:40 and imager like people will say well jib is supposed to be there with a hard g because the g stands
01:48:46 for graphics and not geraptics except that's just not how acronyms work because otherwise scuba
01:48:52 would be pronounced scuba since the u stands for underwater or they'll say well it's because g words
01:48:58 like gift and girl have a hard g never mind that you know giraffe in other words probably exist
01:49:06 and not to mention like what the fuck kind of word would be spelled with a g u but it's pronounced
01:49:11 g like how we do with imager anyway i think i can say that i settled this debate forever
01:49:17 and if you disagree with me then uh suck it losers solved solved uh doesn't doesn't the creator
01:49:26 of the jiff format say jiff i think he does i still say gift because i'm used to it and i don't
01:49:32 care it looks it looks like gift to me so i just i say gift yeah i think there there's an argument
01:49:37 that because it looks so similar to the word gift is just missing a t and giraffe is a little further
01:49:44 away from from what it looks like that saying gift is excusable at the very least it understandable
01:49:54 like assumption to make i mean why why does the guy that made the acronym get to decide how it's
01:50:00 pronounced uh he doesn't what who gave who gave yeah exactly exactly i don't know it just looks
01:50:08 just looks like gift to me and uh to imager is obviously meant to be derivative of the word
01:50:16 image therefore i say imager i don't say imager i did not know scuba was an acronym you didn't
01:50:24 know did did you know laser is an acronym i didn't know that i don't know what it stands for
01:50:32 yes well i remember that the u stands for underwater something underwater being
01:50:42 uh wait no something okay okay uh forget it technically technically the word scuba is not
01:50:51 an acronym but it comes from the acronym for yeah self yeah self-contained underwater breathing
01:50:57 apparatus but you don't write it with like all caps you just write the word scuba yeah
01:51:04 capitalized normally it has become word yeah pretty much pretty much gives weekly reminder
01:51:11 to watch squat cobbler i already forgot what that is isn't it like uh isn't it just like a pie that
01:51:19 you sit on squat cobbler better call soul is that is that a spoiler i haven't seen i've only
01:51:30 watched the first series of better call soul oh right oh i remember it's just yes it's from a scene
01:51:39 in in better call sol i don't know this um i'll get there you know i should i think i've got to
01:51:46 watch the last i still haven't watched like the last two seasons but why what if what if what if i feel
01:51:53 something it'd be embarrassing that would be so embarrassing if i cared um you got caught red-handed
01:52:03 showing feelings next one is called lemau nate got a video out before you ben get right yeah a video
01:52:11 that he fucking spent like six months working on instead of doing the ova i don't care uh next one
01:52:17 is called am late on the episodes three two one go he's the paladin aesthetic moral rowdy or
01:52:30 killer thing paladin
01:52:32 uh obviously it's killer killers are holy warriors for god
01:52:41 but they're evil they're evil holy yeah yeah they're opposite of a paladin a paladin would
01:52:47 have arrived in a new los angeles city and would be disgusted about everything you see is and would
01:52:52 want to to cleanse it just like they're blaggards they're blaggards who think they're paladins
01:52:58 and they're right yeah i guess i guess i guess if if there's like a an aesthetic similarity it would
01:53:05 be more killer than rowdy rowdy would be like the drunken barthog in in a dnd campaign the the the
01:53:11 barred more so than the paladin a barred or a barbarian yeah definitely the pinkie pie of the
01:53:21 group definitely killer definitely killer uh next one is called cave three two one go
01:53:28 have you seen man cave man in cave no usually cave empty
01:53:37 have you seen caven man he's the new boss in mega man mega man 12 caven man he makes the
01:53:44 roof fall on top of here and there's no way to escape no he just he brings the whole house
01:53:51 down on top of both of you uh the next one is uh it's a youtube link but i do say please weigh in
01:54:01 so maybe it's weigh in all right let's let's let's see what it is at least there's a question
01:54:06 which main six is the most thick okay i'm not gonna watch this on the podcast but i'm not
01:54:11 gonna watch a video from quantum hypologists why the most the most thick is um i would say pink
01:54:18 oh my god i'm scrubbing through this number is involved this algebra wait really this data
01:54:26 collection this is funny this is probably funny um i would say it's a toss up between apple jack and
01:54:35 fluttershy i think apple jack just because of her leg when you when you think of thick
01:54:42 usually think thigh bigness and apple jack is usually portrayed as having a huge ass because
01:54:49 of all the bucking she does well i think it's pinky pie because she's black
01:54:58 she's got because she's got because she's got curly hair she's got type type four hair or whatever
01:55:02 also could she eat also yeah i've seen like an i've seen like an index for like
01:55:08 curt like curliness of the hair she's she's she's into she's into the black hair territory i would
01:55:15 say text texturally but more importantly she just eats a lot of cakes at sugar cube corner
01:55:22 she's always yeah but i would always eat in confections i would always say that makes her like
01:55:27 like more fat in the belly than in the thighs necessarily it's both you could argue it's both
01:55:36 i would yeah i would say pinky pie is close i would say apple jack is the thickest
01:55:41 actually no hmm she's she's more lean she would be more lean because she exercises more i i think
01:55:46 she would i think she would be more lean i mean she would be more lean she'd be kind of musculine
01:55:50 but big big and muscular but still lean i guess pinky pie is pretty good of a choice
01:55:55 i could see fluttershy but i think it's i think it's pinky
01:56:03 yeah that's my pick though yeah you know i i'll say pinky pie as well oh my god
01:56:08 sorry this is not relevant to anything but i just see uh two days ago the real gyms uploaded a video
01:56:14 called the simpsons versus death note so that's oh yeah wasn't there like a simpsons episode that
01:56:22 was a death note parody or did i imagine that what there's like a simpsons episode where lisa
01:56:29 gets a fake death note that's that makes something else happen but it's like drawn in an anime style
01:56:35 that looks awful i hate it it looks very strange i don't like it at all
01:56:44 uh i don't like when the simpsons does things that are too wacky i come to the i come to a
01:56:52 franchise show for a familiar experience and by that i mean i don't because i don't watch the
01:56:56 simpsons anymore i don't want to see that it's just hideous hideous yes they they should have
01:57:03 stopped to miss the sparkle absolutely next one is if tom comes back will you redo the intro um
01:57:12 no redo the intro as in like the music yeah i think that's what they mean
01:57:20 just have a little bit of tom speaking over maybe if he made a new intro
01:57:25 be like okay i can accept a change but i'm not gonna go out of my way to like make a whole new
01:57:31 intro just because tom showed up for an episode
01:57:35 that's my answer did you see tom's a furry now did we talk about that already
01:57:44 what do you mean now he's been working on his movie for years he's out he's out of the closet oh my
01:57:49 god i didn't even know he was in well he well he's a he's an owl his son is an owl i didn't see that
01:58:00 which i guess i see it i wasn't i was a bit surprised that it wouldn't be a raccoon but sure
01:58:06 okay owl is fine i guess furry is when you have an oc uh when you have a son i mean furry is when
01:58:13 you have an oc yeah um next one is ben's weekly reminder played yelp delta room chapter two
01:58:22 okay ben's weekly reminder catch up on one piece okay no spoilers favorite character in
01:58:27 description and fave card i mean if it's no spoilers then that's pretty pretty tough
01:58:35 i don't really have a fave yet i i guess i i guess i like the the drawing of that like
01:58:44 pathetic little guy that grows bigger i don't i don't think i've used the drawing of the drawing
01:58:50 of the pathetic little guy that grows bigger it's like uh when you can choose a card from a boss
01:58:56 there's like oh there's geck there's something else and then there's the little guy
01:59:00 that has the uh sigil that makes him grow after one turn oh he looks like he's like in a family
01:59:05 guy death pose and he's like so pathetic looking and i forget what it's called wait are you talking
01:59:10 about like the uh like the useless insect yeah something useless he's called like a useless
01:59:16 little guy or no wait i don't know i can't remember i think i think you're talking about the the
01:59:24 the useless insect or the or the pathetic insect or whatever it's called which i have like never
01:59:29 successful i have like literally never successfully used that card i think maybe one time yeah i just
01:59:35 like the way it looks it's funny but i never chose a good favorite card yeah i think my favorite
01:59:43 card would have to be i do really like the cat i like the sack sigil a lot um i actually really
01:59:55 like i really like the cockroach and field mice because they their sigils i put their sigil on
02:00:01 something else to just get like lots of reuse out of things um what's what's what's one card that
02:00:12 when i find it i'm like fuck yeah game game over i've won i like my own death card because that
02:00:19 was cool oh you know i like corpse maggots the um it's it's probably not as good as like undying
02:00:26 or whatever the cockroach is called but the one that like when a creature dies the card with the
02:00:32 sigil comes into play immediately that one's actually really good you put that on a really
02:00:36 expensive card and you can just get like a real good card on the board for free i like that one a
02:00:43 lot uh yeah that's that's my answer i can't i can't answer a favorite character without spoiling it i'm
02:00:51 sorry um next one is called regi drako is made out of crystallized dragon energy hmm yeah make
02:01:01 sense no it doesn't that's what no that makes perfect sense of course it's crystallized dragon
02:01:07 energy i mean define dragon energy though like what is well you know it's like it's like when a dragon
02:01:16 does something it uses dragon energy to do it like what separates a dragon from a bear or a
02:01:23 lizard or a fucking anything are they are they mythical but they're not like mythical legendaries
02:01:31 they're just a mythical being that they come from space what is so special about fucking dragons
02:01:37 they're just a special kind of guy just like bugs just like bugs are just guys but they're like a
02:01:43 particular special kind of guy with special energy i would love to see a red bug energy
02:01:48 bug a redgy bug that's made of crystallized bug energy honestly yeah why not uh it's like
02:01:55 you know it's just like that episode of the power rangers where they cloned the pink ranger
02:02:02 and zordon had to be like we have to put a stop to this too much pink energy is dangerous
02:02:07 there's going to be a freaking like nuclear meltdown if we don't like pair these these pink
02:02:13 rangers down to one well it's the same with dragon energy like too much dragon energy is dangerous
02:02:17 so you have to crystallize it to stabilize it and that's regi draco of course just you just
02:02:23 plug like a little you get you get like little alligator teeth like wires and you clip them to
02:02:30 a dragon tooth you can power your generator with it mm-hmm mm-hmm that's right dragon energy uh
02:02:38 dragons in series dragons in parallel
02:02:47 what time isn't it it's 12 20 i woke up early time i like woke up before i was i was supposed to
02:02:58 woke up because like an hour before my alarm went off and i couldn't go back to sleep
02:03:02 uh okay um i'm getting i'm getting getting tired is what i'm saying next one is called uh happy
02:03:10 no next one is called my god cheesy is such an idiot leave cheesy alone leave cheesy alone
02:03:16 he's hustling he's hustling and i respect it uh happy birthday ben okay the next one is called
02:03:24 fr 3 2 1 go okay guys and all of this blabbering
02:03:32 either talk about weed or let's move on to the voicemail we are listening to a voicemail
02:03:41 dear you are a voicemail we're in the voicemails because uh you we have a damn mind
02:03:47 out of your damn mind we would never talk about weed we don't do weed i mean except that one time
02:03:55 i don't do weed everybody else does weed and i just i'm just not i'm just not that big a fan
02:04:01 i've just come to i've just come to accept that i'm just not that big a fan and people say no no
02:04:05 you just didn't do it right no no you just didn't you just haven't tried it enough i'm like no i've
02:04:09 tried it enough no i know what it's like no i'm i'm good i i have enjoyed weed but i think it's a
02:04:20 little uh it's a little hit and miss whether it's like the right dosage and it gets me exactly
02:04:29 how i want whereas with alcohol um it's all the right you know that the right dosage is always
02:04:35 more wow it's it's it's that it's that i can have like an entire beer and um that is it's more mass
02:04:47 per like um inebriation so like you don't really have to think too hard about it you can just
02:04:55 drink and like it's it's like judge later it's it's the the stopping at the exact right moment
02:05:02 is a lot easier with alcohol because you feel it quite quickly with weed you take um whatever
02:05:10 however you take the weed and then over a longer period of time then you slowly realize that you
02:05:17 took one too many of the thingies and it's like well now i'm just stuck like this that sucks i
02:05:24 wish i would have known a little earlier how much weed was just right um obviously over time you'd
02:05:31 get a sense of it but like with alcohol you can just stop a beer halfway if you're feeling too much
02:05:38 uh yeah i mean beer you kind of have the same i mean you can you can end up drinking too much
02:05:43 they're not even it they're not equivalent experiences either i'm i'm just saying that i
02:05:48 feel like i'm more in control of having fun with alcohol when you're taken like an edible you pretty
02:05:54 much have to decide completely ahead of time like how much am i gonna take i'm gonna i'm gonna
02:06:00 commit to an amount like right now yeah and i mean you can't you can take more later if you want
02:06:07 uh no i get no i get you i get you make sense um next one is called ben we all knew it was
02:06:14 a mega man lecture lamal three two one go okay there's no audio uh no you didn't i mean maybe you
02:06:22 did i will admit i think people could have guessed because you were talking about doing a big video
02:06:28 yeah and certain things were ruled out and also you were talking about you were you played mega
02:06:33 man on stream a little bit yeah some people did guess it and that's fine but not everyone did and
02:06:42 i saw and i saw other guesses uh that were not right so not everyone not everybody knew not
02:06:50 everyone and even the one and even the ones that did know that guessed it right they still had they
02:06:56 had to doubt they had to doubt themselves and that was the point the point was not that like
02:07:01 no one can know that i'm making a mega man video the point is um but they don't know for sure
02:07:07 they'll never they'll never know for sure until i tell them um next one is called vvv
02:07:16 one one zero five two two hope i didn't miss it at uploading the morning of dot com uh this is
02:07:24 probably some viny stuff the viny stuff most i look forward to viny comics i really like him
02:07:31 yeah yeah i'm holding this sunday morning hope i didn't miss it there you go your covid vaccine
02:07:42 thanks you may have a small sting for the next few days in your arm goodbye sir
02:07:47 he's supposed to syringe up like that yeah uh-huh so sad i thought you're supposed to be like
02:07:57 blushing like oh sexy nurse oh maybe maybe and then uh oh no am i getting my myocarditis
02:08:08 thump thump thump thump thump thump oh no just another day of suffering for an old
02:08:16 then saint and then uh ew gross look at my little butt what do you stink is that the stink lines
02:08:28 it's it's that or it's maybe like a vape vape scene oh yeah or something it's probably both
02:08:34 honestly. This is so unflattering. Yeah, it's true. It's true. You're in your bed
02:08:41 tweeting with your butt out. Gross. Welcome to Ben St's Mega Man comprehensive
02:08:47 lecture. We will be going into why you should care about Mega Man at all. Mega Man was a
02:08:52 video game character. You know, one thing that was missing from my lecture was
02:09:01 drawings on the board and diagrams. And then in Saab, Mega Man 04, I'm sorry. It's
02:09:09 so crippling and depressing. I cry every time I get into this game. The next five
02:09:13 minutes of the video is going to be crying uninterrupted. Hey, the end of
02:09:19 Mega Man 04 is wicked good and wicked cool and it's wicked sad and it rules. Man.
02:09:26 I hope you wore this sort of outfit. I unfortunately did not really have like a
02:09:36 costume or anything. I wish I had. I just wore my freaking plane going by. I just
02:09:43 wore my purple suit with the Lord of Ghost pin. Yes. Yes, and I had my rip in
02:09:51 that ghost. Rip in the ghost and I had my Z Saber. Of course. I had my Z Saber and I
02:09:58 had my little energy tank sippy cup that I was drinking gridlock energy out of. So, you
02:10:07 know, I did a little something, something. The idea of using a Mega Man arm cannon as
02:10:14 a laser pointer. Would have been pretty cool. Would have been rather difficult.
02:10:21 Rather difficult. Did you know that Mega Man's Mega Buster does like suck back into
02:10:29 his arm when he's not using it? And he can in fact turn either of his arms into a
02:10:34 Mega Buster whenever he wants. But he can't fire them both at once because it
02:10:39 would take too much energy from his solar core. On the other hand, Protoman has a
02:10:45 Mega Buster, but he can't transform it back into his arm. He must have to like
02:10:51 unscrew it and put like an arm, a hand like attachment on his arm when he doesn't
02:10:56 want to be shooting stuff with his protobuster. So now you know. I didn't even
02:11:03 mention that in the lecture because it's not because it's not really cannon in
02:11:08 the games. You talk about the similarities to Astro Boy because the idea of the
02:11:12 cannon going back into his arm reminds me that. I do not mention Astro Boy even
02:11:18 once. Dang. That's the only little robot guy I know.
02:11:26 Well, now you'll know some more.
02:11:29 We all do a fucking lecture about Astro Boy. Do it. Do it. Content for the
02:11:35 content mill. My God. Content.
02:11:44 I guess that's it. That's the last voicemail.
02:11:46 Yeah. Well, pleasure doing business with you.
02:11:55 Oh, I see an Imgur link to a Bo Burnham saying something that I agree with.
02:12:01 That's fucked up. Oh, Burnham is often saying that.
02:12:04 Things I don't know. I still have not seen inside.
02:12:08 It's pretty great.
02:12:10 Right. Yeah, I've heard all of his specials are really good.
02:12:13 Yeah. I watched the previous ones.
02:12:18 I haven't seen inside.
02:12:23 That's all I got. That's all I got today.
02:12:26 Audience.
02:12:29 She's got nothing.
02:12:32 What did I manage to only talk for that? Did we even make it to two hours?
02:12:36 Yeah, we did. Pathetic.
02:12:38 Pathetic.
02:12:40 Remember when the PCP used to be like an hour and a half?
02:12:44 I honestly don't.
02:12:46 Because it was like a larger cost and we went for so much less time.
02:12:52 I feel like sometimes I would be on the podcast and have like an interjection.
02:12:59 And that's it. That's the only thing I did in the entire thing and I was over.
02:13:03 Yeah, they were short. The old episodes, they would be like an hour 20 sometimes.
02:13:07 Like it's fucked up.
02:13:10 That's not content. That's that's not even.
02:13:14 That's nothing. That's that's a puff of air.
02:13:21 All I got to say. Yeah, I mean, I feel like we've got nothing to say.
02:13:25 I got nothing to say. All I got to say is watch it worse.
02:13:28 Watch my stupid Mega Man video. Yeah.
02:13:31 And pledge to my Patreon if you want to send me the message that this is what
02:13:37 you need. This is what you need to be doing, Ben.

02:13:45 a form of income as a living, this is a this is the response.
02:13:48 I need to see that I need to see that the I need to see that the support is there.
02:13:54 And if I do and if and if it's and if it does well and it makes a little money,
02:13:58 then I'll be like, OK, well, I'll have to plan the next one.
02:14:01 And if it fails and if nobody pledges, then I will probably just disappear
02:14:05 in a puff of smoke and never be heard from again.
02:14:10 I'm sorry. I'm I'm not trying to hold anything hostage,
02:14:13 but like that's that's the reality of the situation.
02:14:17 If it doesn't work, I'm going to stop doing it. So there you go.
02:14:22 I got some phlegm.
02:14:24 I got some phlegm. Oh, it's the Kovacab.
02:14:27 Coughing up some of that inflamed heart tissue.
02:14:31 Gross, gross, hideous.
02:14:34 All right, I'm going to go make some gummy worms.
02:14:37 Yeah, let's end the podcast.
02:14:39 I'm not going to do that.
02:14:40 I also remember to commission me if you feel like having a drawing.
02:14:44 Oh, yes, that I made.
02:14:45 I'm pretty good at that now.
02:14:48 You've been you've been improving every time I see your drawings.
02:14:52 I think this is this is even better.
02:14:56 The more more detailed, more, more,
02:15:00 I don't know, a
02:15:02 structurally sound.
02:15:04 Yeah, yeah, yeah, stuff like that.
02:15:06 More anatomy, but not like more anatomy.
02:15:10 More body parts, more muscles, defined, excruciating detail.
02:15:16 Yes, excruciating.
02:15:20 All right, that's the end of the podcast.
02:15:22 We'll see you next week.
