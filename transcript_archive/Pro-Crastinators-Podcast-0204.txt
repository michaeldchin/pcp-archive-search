00:00:00 Get out of me swamp. Welcome everybody. Get out of my swamp. It's the PCP. I'm the best
00:00:10 guy ever. We've got Ben Saint in his swamp. I'm here. I'm showering in mud and farting
00:00:17 to kill fish. That's the thing. And Tom Oliver. I'm still sick post-radcon with not coronavirus
00:00:27 and it's pretty annoying. It's pretty fucking annoying. I don't feel like sick. Like I have
00:00:33 a disease but I feel like really tired all the time. Yeah. I'm back to 100% feeling and
00:00:40 my only issue now is I need to start exercising because I know I'll feel better. I will probably
00:00:44 feel better if I started exercising again. I just feel like I wake up early. I've been
00:00:48 waking up early lately and then like three hours later I'm like, man, can I go back to
00:00:55 bed again? And then I just feel like that for the rest of the day. It's based. Exercise
00:01:01 would probably help. Probably. Real recommendation anyway. I called my doctor and they were like,
00:01:05 it sounds like you have a sinus infection. Go get a sinus infection medication. I'm just
00:01:09 like, I don't want to go to a pharmacy. That seems like the worst place to go during a
00:01:13 pandemic where all the sick people go. Just wear a mask. Put your scarf over your face.
00:01:19 No, I'm a scared populist person who watches too many scary things. I mean, I don't want
00:01:25 to go outside either, but like I have to go out for like groceries and stuff. I'm a go
00:01:30 to the grocery store probably. Wait, have you been using Instacart? Yes. How? I've tried
00:01:37 to use Instacart a bunch of times and they're all like, oh yeah, there's no deliverers available
00:01:43 not for like four days. Probably because you're in Boston and I'm in the middle of nowhere.
00:01:48 Wouldn't that, I feel like that would make me more likely to be able to. No, because
00:01:52 there's more demand. There's more supply, but there's way more demand because you're
00:01:57 in a city. I guess that makes sense. They're legitimately not available because they're
00:02:00 busy. I mean, maybe it's just that they're too busy and not that nobody wants to do
00:02:04 it. Right, right. Yeah, it could be. Like when I order Instacart, it's like, hey, your
00:02:09 order will be here by 2pm, like okay, and then like it'll be delayed like four times
00:02:13 and then it'll get there like seven at night. Right, right. You know, I should do that.
00:02:17 I want to, I'm working from home. I'm working on all these Radcon videos and stuff. I should
00:02:20 just fucking Instacart. What do I do? Well, apparently Instacart workers are organizing
00:02:24 a strike soon. So maybe I shouldn't, maybe I shouldn't strike break. My friend works
00:02:30 does Instacart and he showed me like the payouts and they're pathetic and terrible and bad.
00:02:36 And I was like, why are you doing this? Yeah, why would you do it? I'm sure they're bad.
00:02:41 Fringe to the max. I've just been going to, I've just been going to Whole Foods, you know,
00:02:45 looking like a fucking wasteland warrior, wearing my like scarf over my mouth with my
00:02:50 fucking dyed hair and shit and like a, my coat. I'm the only one who does it too. There's
00:02:57 like old people who are wearing medical masks and then everyone else just looks normal and
00:03:02 I'm like, I'm like all mouth covered and stuff, feeling like a freak, but I'm convinced that
00:03:08 I'm right and everyone else is wrong. When I was coming back from Radcon at the airport,
00:03:12 I saw a bunch of people in gloves and a couple of people in masks. That was like pretty much
00:03:15 the highest. Yeah, I wear gloves when I go into Whole Foods. I put gloves on. I don't
00:03:21 touch anything. I would never, ever, I'm never going to touch that keypad. Sure. Wear gloves
00:03:27 the whole time. It's based. Makes sense. Makes sense. Yeah, I'll probably do that if I end
00:03:32 up going up. Hey, speaking of going to stores. Hey, big news guys, I know you've been waiting
00:03:38 to hear this, but it's, I'm sorry to say it's true. GameStop sales have dropped by 26% in
00:03:44 the fourth quarter. Oh, wait, so sorry, everyone. Sorry to let you know. What's dropped in the
00:03:49 fourth quarter? GameStop sales. Are you not aware of the saga of GameStop and what they've
00:03:55 been doing in the wake of this crisis? I mean, I know that they're bad. What have they been
00:03:59 doing, Tom? I don't actually know. Oh, so GameStop in response to like everything closing
00:04:05 down, they tried to make the case that they were an essential service and should stay
00:04:08 open. Oh, yeah. My gamer score, Tom, my gamer score. And then like they didn't provide anything
00:04:16 for their employees and they actually like sent out an internal email to like the managers
00:04:21 and they were like, if the cops come, give them this number to call because you can't
00:04:26 close even if the police come to close you down. Bro, when the bombs drop and it's us
00:04:31 against us, the only currency that's going to matter is gamer score. It's important.
00:04:35 That's an essential function, you know, society. You're right. I guess GameStop Corporation
00:04:40 knew the correct shares thing all the time. Yeah, you know, I just happened to see a thing
00:04:46 before this that said that like, oh, they're closing 300 storefronts this year. Okay, which
00:04:51 obviously isn't bad. But do you know how many GameStop stores there are too many nationwide?
00:04:57 As of googling just now, 5,500 stores. So that represents what like a 5% maybe maybe more
00:05:06 than that 10%. Yeah, a little over 5%. It's like six, six and a half, 7% something like
00:05:11 that. So obviously the trend is down. And I mean, I you know, I have some sympathy for
00:05:18 like or some some attunement to the argument that like, you want to own your physical media
00:05:23 because I fucking hate patches and shit in in a sense that games are being wiped off the
00:05:27 earth because you can't get creators make little George Lucas esque tweaks and the fuck
00:05:34 things around. I just want the classic original. Her name is Eris. You can't tell me her name
00:05:38 is Eris. I will never submit and I will never surrender. But but why the fuck would you go
00:05:45 to GameStop? Would you just download the game? I mean, that's, you know, I don't get it. I
00:05:50 like never buy games in physical media. I mean, I just I just order them from Amazon.
00:05:54 They're usually cheaper or just get them used from eBay. But they have to wait like days,
00:05:59 several days for it. But I don't have to get out of my chair. And that is definitely worth
00:06:05 waiting two days. But I don't have to get out of my chair if I go on the switch store and download
00:06:10 the game directly on there or steal a game from the internet. But then the bad people win because
00:06:15 then you don't own your media anymore. And when your switch console breaks and you can't port
00:06:21 any of your shit over to the new replacement system you buy, because Nintendo is living in
00:06:25 the Stone Age when it comes to internet, you're fucked. Okay, I'm happily in the valley of it
00:06:32 feels like this is the way things are going. I would love to for things to not necessarily go
00:06:37 this way. But I can't do it alone. So I give up. And I'll just do what's convenient. We could have
00:06:42 been brothers in arms, but you've abandoned me. In some ways I am. But the convenience argument
00:06:49 is too strong. It's far too sounds like you're part of the problem, Nate. The most No, I think
00:06:54 I'm part of the solution. Convenience is everything. It's all I want. It's all I have just like a
00:07:00 capitalist bootlicker going for the convenience over fucking anything else. How sad. That's true.
00:07:05 I mean, why would you ever buy a video game? Which of Maslow's hierarchy of needs does it
00:07:15 serve? Why would you even buy video games in the first place? Truly the worst thing to do.
00:07:20 Can you eat a video game? Can it shelter you from the elements? Depends on how many you have, I
00:07:26 guess. You can't build a shelter out of downloads, but if you have enough jewel cases, you can.
00:07:33 So clearly I'm in the right here. Yes, Ben. I want to see you collect that vapor,
00:07:38 you spew from your fiery gullet and try to make a shelter or live off of that. You degenerate.
00:07:47 I believe in the miasma theory of disease. I don't believe in bacteria. So by filling my room
00:07:54 with vapors that smell like cotton candy or blueberry or blueberry cake or mango sorbet,
00:08:00 I believe I will be protected from infection, yes. Okay, well said. Well argued.
00:08:07 It's like, wait, no, it's the opposite of what Digi said with Destiny that even if you make a
00:08:15 bad, if you make a good case for a bad argument, Digi said, no, you lose. No, he said you win,
00:08:21 whatever. Oh god, I can't remember. It was too confusing. I'm sorry to bring it up. What a nightmare.
00:08:25 Well, that's it guys. Game stop. That's all that's on my mind. You guys all, you guys quarantined?
00:08:34 Still quarantined. You know, it's this, you know, the joke, the joke going around on the
00:08:40 internet is everyone's like, haha, I never leave my house anyway. And that's true. I am not, life
00:08:46 is not very much different for me personally under quarantine than it was at any other time.
00:08:54 And yet, and yet, it feels worse. It feels because now you have to, you're not doing it
00:09:00 voluntarily. I don't like that. I don't like that. I guess so. I guess that has to be it.
00:09:06 But here's a silver lining, Ben. Here's a silver lining. It just feels more stressful because
00:09:10 I'm seeing people like talking about it on Twitter and like people on Twitter and stuff are like,
00:09:14 oh boy, I'm cooped up in the house. This is so bad. And I'm like, and it makes me self-conscious,
00:09:18 like, oh no, me too. And now I, but now I feel bad about it. Well, no, here's the thing. The thing
00:09:23 is that like you realize, oh, I should feel bad about it. My entire life for the last like 10
00:09:28 years, I've been living like I was in a pandemic without realizing it. Yeah, kind of. That's pretty
00:09:34 fucked a little bit. Yeah. But but but the silver lining guys, the payout, the payout was approved.
00:09:40 We're getting $1,200. Oh my god. That's true. Yeah. You know, hey, that'll pay rent for one month.
00:09:44 That's not bad. But here's the thing. For us specifically, they're saying unemployment works
00:09:48 for a gig economy and like people working like like independently. So we might actually be
00:09:54 able to get a couple months of unemployment as well. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
00:09:58 Yeah. What? What? Yeah, dude. What? Yeah, I don't, how? How? That doesn't make any sense.
00:10:05 I want to believe it's true. I mean, let me pull up the article again. Someone sent it to me. It was
00:10:09 like, Hey, does this apply to you? For self-employed 1099 creatives who have lost employment due to
00:10:15 COVID-19, everyone is fixated on the one time $1,200 check. But for the first time ever,
00:10:19 freelancers are eligible for unemployment pay plus $600 per week through the end of July.
00:10:26 Per week, baby. Let me, let me for no particular reason point out that those
00:10:32 uninsurance protections were included in the bill specifically because Bernie Sanders pushed for
00:10:38 them to be there. So if we all get $600 a week, we have Bernie to thank for it.
00:10:44 That's all I have to say about that. Based. But I heard that like, we don't get paid out until like,
00:10:51 I heard that those checks won't be going out until like May, which seems like a little.
00:10:54 I don't figure that as well. I mean, I'm not sure if that's true, but that's what I heard.
00:10:57 To cover. To do those.
00:11:00 Okay. So that's not good for people who are literally living, you know, paycheck to paycheck.
00:11:06 But I guess I like to think that most people have enough money to, you know,
00:11:09 dig into their savings until that comes to account. Most people have no savings.
00:11:13 A lot don't. A lot. What is it? What was it?
00:11:16 Yang would always throw out the statistic and so would Bernie that like 40% of Americans
00:11:21 can't afford like a $500 emergency or something like that. Right. Right.
00:11:25 So that's pretty bad. Pretty bad. Rent strike. I mean, that's rough. That's rough.
00:11:30 Rent strike. Damn you Nancy Pelosi holding up the bill. Curse you. Curse you woman.
00:11:35 The, you know, for one day, I heard that I heard that Canada, Canada is getting $2,000 per person
00:11:44 for four months, as opposed to our one time $1,200. Well, pretty cool.
00:11:51 We just, we just used, you know, 75% of that money to bail out everybody but the common
00:11:56 person because that's much more important. That's, oh, that's after. So we gave them 1.5 trillion
00:12:03 out of the $2 trillion and then we also gave them $1.5 trillion a couple like last month
00:12:09 to jumpstart the stock market for 20 minutes before it crashed again.
00:12:14 Yeah. So, you know, you know, about that first bailout, I did learn that it's not,
00:12:19 it's not as simple as we just took $1.5 trillion from the budget and just gave it to companies.
00:12:26 It's more like, it's weirder than that. It's like, they basically just went into the government,
00:12:33 the government computer like fund and just like edited the number to say,
00:12:39 we have $1.5 trillion more than we have. And then gave that as like sort of a short-term loan
00:12:46 to those companies to like liquidate assets. And then they were given back the money,
00:12:53 the quote unquote money, the phantom money, and then it was like deleted again.
00:12:58 So it's not like, it's not as simple as they just gave them $1.5 trillion,
00:13:03 they just invented $1.5 trillion that did not exist out of whole cloth,
00:13:07 pretended to give it to some people to fix the, to try and fix the economy,
00:13:12 and then unpretended it. So I don't know. I don't understand that at all. Money is,
00:13:17 money is literally fake. Money is a spook. It's made up. The government, the government has as
00:13:22 much money as they say they have. You know, it occurs to me that all our current,
00:13:30 I forget the word for it, but this whole system, capitalism, we have an entire country that has
00:13:35 expanded itself to a very wide degree on the back of, I mean, this is just basic economic theory
00:13:41 of capitalism or whatever, on the back of like, there's all this money in play that can be promised
00:13:46 here. It's like your basic loan thing. Your bank has money and it loans it out. That money
00:13:50 doesn't actually exist all the time, but there are expectations of earnings and whatnot,
00:13:54 so that when the machine grinds to a halt, like there is nothing there to support it,
00:13:58 and then it collapse. I mean, this is just your basic fucking bubble theory or whatever.
00:14:02 I don't think I would have done that if it was me in charge. That seems pretty irresponsible,
00:14:07 but maybe it's not. I don't know. I've been against fractional reserve banking ever since
00:14:13 guys two fucking red-pilled me on that shit like 15 years ago.
00:14:19 You lost me there. What are you saying you wouldn't have done?
00:14:22 I don't know. I can't express it any better than I did.
00:14:24 For fractional reserve banking, for every dollar that comes into a bank, a bank is allowed to loan
00:14:29 to $10 out because of the way the system works. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, gotcha.
00:14:35 So when something happens and they call the debt or whatever, the problem we're having is not
00:14:41 specifically a run on the bank, though. No, no, it's a separate issue. I mean,
00:14:46 it just occurs to me that I mean, all this stuff is intertwined in the underpinnings of our broken
00:14:52 fucked up society. So when one thing fails, it all fails. Sure. And now the big thing this week
00:14:59 was like Republicans calling for this cure is worse than the disease. We got to get everyone
00:15:06 back to work because like, sure, people will die, but like, we can't let the we can't let the economy
00:15:11 crash. You're right, because the economy, unlike everything we just explained about why it actually
00:15:16 is important for our overextended world, we can just let that collapse. And it'll be totally fine.
00:15:21 Don't worry about it. No one's going to get hurt as a result of that. I mean, I mean, the economy,
00:15:25 I mean, as as a elaborated upon in the example of the just made up a bunch of imaginary money,
00:15:32 the money in the economy is all fake. It's all it's all a dream, a whisper in the wind.
00:15:40 But but but but further than that, further than that, the problem with that line of thinking,
00:15:45 okay, maybe maybe you do believe that there will be like a like a measurable like cost of like human
00:15:52 life, specifically from a from an economy crash, right? Well, like maybe maybe if you if you believe
00:15:59 that, you could try and weigh it against, okay, what is the what is the cost of allowing COVID-19
00:16:05 to spread versus crashing the economy? And that's a reasonable line of inquiry. But like,
00:16:09 yeah, if you're saying like, oh, we got to get people back to work, we can't we can't let this
00:16:14 virus stall the economy. That's bad. Well, like, okay. But if you people go back to work and they
00:16:21 stop self quarantining, then the infection will continue to spread. And like, that just
00:16:26 unsolves the problem. And we're going to have an economic crash anyway, from like,
00:16:30 millions of people dying. Like, that's like, that's going to be way, like, not only is that I think
00:16:38 a bad way to go about it, it doesn't even like on it doesn't even solve the problem it purports to
00:16:43 solve of preventing the economy from crashing. Well, you're totally right. If that happens,
00:16:47 I mean, yes, it would be it would be not only would it be bad, then it would kind of be have
00:16:52 pointless to have even done anything that made the economy go bad in the first place,
00:16:56 which is obviously foolish that likes the worst of both. It would all it would also undo the
00:17:01 utility of everything that has been done. Yeah. Yeah. So what's the right answer? Oh, God, I'm
00:17:07 too stupid. Professional epidemiologists who seem to agree that mass quarantining for a period
00:17:18 is the right way to go. I believe that works for South Korea.
00:17:23 Is that what they did? They they they did mass testing really quickly isolated everybody who
00:17:29 had the disease quarantine them and now they're kind of doing better. Yeah, I saw that like their
00:17:34 curve was like, flat AF. Yeah. Damn. I mean, you know, yeah, sure, this would spread the disease.
00:17:42 But like, why not have like, the young people are mostly fine. Maybe there could just be like,
00:17:46 the people who are the higher risk are self there's a bunch of young people now.
00:17:51 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, first of all, the proportions of people infected. I mean, you know,
00:17:56 listen, young people can die of it. But sure, furthermore, it's the point of quarantining everyone
00:18:03 is that the infection stops spreading and the virus is killed. Like, yeah, young people mostly
00:18:09 don't die of it, but they can still spread it. Well, sure. Listener, fair listener. None of us
00:18:15 know what we're talking about. I just finished watching this awesome video by cold fusion,
00:18:18 one of my favorite YouTubers about the virus and like the cures that are being worked on right now.
00:18:23 It's fucking great. It's a LinkedIn in the show notes. Watch it, subscribe to cold fusion,
00:18:28 one of the best YouTubers on the platform. Really good shit. I'm looking at, you know,
00:18:34 I'll be honest, the biggest thing about this is it's fucking boring is what it is. It's
00:18:39 fucking boring and I don't care and I'm really bored and I just want to do other shit and I'm
00:18:44 sick of everybody talking about it. Fine, be quarantined. What would you be doing? Yeah,
00:18:49 I'm going to say, are you not in the boat of like, I would just be home anyway? I mean,
00:18:53 I definitely am. But I'm sick of it dominating everyone's thoughts. That's what annoys me.
00:18:59 And look, I get it. It's a big deal, but I could also be bored of that. Here's the thing,
00:19:03 though, the fact that we're all saying like, Oh God, the fact that like everyone's talking
00:19:07 about COVID-19, it's so boring. That just shows that we're too glued to social media. We have all
00:19:13 this free time to just go do actual productive things or just watch anime. Like I started
00:19:19 watching Olive Shirabako. That was much better than just being on Twitter reading about COVID-19.
00:19:24 Go use your time wisely, people. Go do something fucking cool.
00:19:27 I'm no goddamn Twitter animal who's on Twitter all day reading about this stuff. I'm just saying
00:19:33 that in the feeds that I already follow, there has been certainly a shift toward this subject
00:19:39 matter. Just block coronavirus and COVID-19.
00:19:45 You're not going to get any like vital information about the outbreak through Twitter anyways.
00:19:50 I mean, I use Twitter for cute anime girls. That's what I use Twitter for. So that's not the
00:19:54 issue, Twitter. It's mostly like YouTube videos. Thank God, 2D waifus can't get the coronavirus.
00:19:59 They're safe. I'm looking at this flow chart.
00:20:04 Uh, or I'm, man, can I do this? Can I file for unemployment insurance?
00:20:15 I mean, I haven't been fired or anything, but I don't know. What are the conditions?
00:20:21 Is it just if I don't make enough money, then I qualify for unemployment insurance?
00:20:25 If that's the case, then maybe I would just get unemployment insurance.
00:20:28 That would be pretty sick. I don't know.
00:20:30 I want to roll the dice. I want to try. Why not?
00:20:32 Well, nothing wrong with trying if you want to.
00:20:34 I guess I should look into it.
00:20:38 Like I'm so fucking poor that getting even just $600 a month, not even a week, would double my
00:20:45 income. Oh, dude. Oh, dude. Hell yeah. Please God, let this work.
00:20:51 What is this about a SBA paycheck protection loan? It says to apply for. I don't know what that is.
00:20:58 Thank you for this infographic, Tom. I will be looking into it shortly.
00:21:02 If you figure out anything, let me know. I'm going to start looking to it as well,
00:21:05 because I want to get to the bottom of this shit.
00:21:08 Let's do a left turn here. I've got something else to discuss.
00:21:11 And it's that. Okay.
00:21:14 So there are three PCPU lectures coming out, or already out, sorry. There's Ben's,
00:21:20 Tom's, and Gibbs. They have been very well received. And mine, by the time you get this.
00:21:24 Tom's is literally, it's accelerating in views. It is not flattening. It is gaining views at an
00:21:31 increasing rate. Did you guys see what you guys think about your experience of getting them out
00:21:35 so far since we talk about them so much? And I'm really happy with the response. It was funny,
00:21:40 because I was in this morning in the Radcon for Discord, and someone was like, hey, a few days
00:21:46 ago, some guy uploaded an Animorphs video and was like, oh, yeah, it's beginning. Was it just
00:21:52 intolerant or something? Yeah, the video was pretty shit. I didn't like it, and I don't like the guy's
00:21:57 channel. I have seen that guy's channel. It's, by the way, it's James Tullo. James Tullo. I saw
00:22:03 that today, and I posted a comment in the comments saying, because in the video, he says, like, oh,
00:22:09 I could, if you wanted a full explanation on this, on the lore of this series, that would take me
00:22:13 forever. And so I commented like, oh, if anyone wants that explanation, there's a link to exactly
00:22:18 such a video. Got four hours free. It's funny, I almost did that as well. But I ended up forgetting,
00:22:24 because I'm dumb. And I was too busy watching COVID-19 treatment by Cold Fusion.
00:22:30 So I mean, yeah, what do you think? What are the odds? This guy published two days ago.
00:22:34 He says in the video that he had been meaning to put out an Animorphs video for a while.
00:22:39 Okay, I believe it. Yeah, he's a book guy. He just talks about books.
00:22:44 His whole channel is him just talking about like fantasy books, mostly.
00:22:48 I wonder if he feels cucked that you got yours out right before he got his.
00:22:52 I mean, he has 50k subs. So his is already like catching up to my video, despite being
00:22:56 out for like a third of the time. So I'm pretty sure he'll do just fine.
00:23:02 But his video, his video was not good. The production values were basically non-existent.
00:23:08 And he was just like, Animorphs was so weird. Lots of stupid shit happened. Man, the 90s were
00:23:13 dumb. I heard he had a very negative take overall on the series. It was pretty bad.
00:23:17 Fair enough, I guess. He basically just lists off the five weirdest things.
00:23:23 They're not even the weirdest things.
00:23:25 Anything that you didn't touch on in your video.
00:23:28 Yeah, there was some of the filler books that I've left out because I just want to
00:23:32 write a general plot. There's one where Rachel morphs into a starfish, but gets cut in half.
00:23:37 Oh, yeah, that's right. My favorite one is how canonically El Fangor founded Microsoft.
00:23:45 Is that true? Yeah.
00:23:47 Why and how did that happen?
00:23:49 Well, he didn't found Microsoft. What he did is like, well, he was a human nofflet.
00:23:56 He's like, he goes through a general human education, but he's an andalite. So he's super
00:24:00 fucking smart. And like he can easily get his PhD and whatever because it's like baby shit to him.
00:24:07 But there's one offline where he's like, yeah, I helped my friends, Steve and Bill
00:24:12 start their companies and it's Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. And it's just like cheeky.
00:24:17 What the fuck? That's really funny. That's really funny.
00:24:20 Hey, by the way, speaking of Microsoft just reminds me, are you guys aware that not only is
00:24:26 Bill Gates like in a hard quarantine, like in a boat offshore because the world may or may not
00:24:30 be ending, but also like he did a TED talk just like exactly predicting exactly what COVID is
00:24:36 right now. Have you seen that? No.
00:24:39 Yeah, I watched it just the other day. Or most of it anyway. I mean, he's just talking about
00:24:44 exactly what we're going through. And this is like two years ago. It was like two or three years ago.
00:24:48 And are you telling me the Bilderberg group engineered COVID-19 and is this all a big
00:24:53 experiment done by the deep state? Because I believe it. Maybe, maybe. But he's mostly like,
00:24:59 guys, please, let's make sure we're prepared. Please God, there are things we can do. No,
00:25:04 but then we didn't. Oops. Sorry, Bill. I popped into, I popped into a Pantsu party live stream
00:25:11 the other day. Those things are popping off these days. Where I don't, is that sarcastic?
00:25:16 I don't know. No, no. Maybe it's getting some good people on there. Didn't she
00:25:20 get like channel, get like shadow band or something? Yeah, I think it did. Somebody said
00:25:24 that it did. And like her side channel too, I think. They were discussing how COVID-19 is a
00:25:32 Chinese bio weapon designed to thin the population. I mean, some aspects of that,
00:25:38 some aspects could be true because they, it may have come from a lab. And then I mean, you know,
00:25:42 I mean, I went and I googled it and I did not see any credible information. I found a bunch of
00:25:50 articles being like, here's how we know that it did not come from a lab. No, it is not a bio weapon.
00:25:55 I mean, I'm not gonna, I've been in the air a little, I'm not going to claim that like that's
00:25:59 hard evidence of anything, but I haven't seen any evidence that it is a bio weapon. So,
00:26:05 if anyone's got any, I guess I'd be marginally interested in seeing it. Kind of sounds like
00:26:11 some crackpot shit to me. Certainly could be. I mean, this is, I mean, the coronavirus is,
00:26:16 it's just like a new version of like the same thing that caused SARS. This isn't like a new
00:26:20 invention. Yeah, I mean, for me, I'm much more concerned with the cover up China did after
00:26:27 it was already loose and that's not so good. Yeah, sure. That's just China being China. I'd be more
00:26:33 surprised if they didn't cover it up. If it turned out it was a bio weapon, I would be concerned,
00:26:38 but I don't know that, you know, whatever. I don't know. I'll just, I just need to see evidence
00:26:45 of such a thing. Of course, I agree. I agree. I think a lot of people just don't trust the Chinese
00:26:49 government too much. And so maybe they're a little tempted to lean on, they're bad boys,
00:26:55 which they are. They're doing some genocide over there. Let me complain about, let me complain
00:26:58 about something. Everyone, there was a, okay, first people got mad at Trump for calling it
00:27:05 the Chinese virus. And then there was a reaction of people like, why is it racist to call it the
00:27:11 Chinese? It's not racist to call it the Chinese virus. We name things, it's just where it came
00:27:15 from. We name things after where they came from. Ever heard of the Spanish flu? Did you see them
00:27:21 update the Wikipedia article on the Spanish flu to remove that it's called the Spanish flu?
00:27:26 That was pretty funny. I did not. I mean, I mean, I heard some people talking about that. I don't
00:27:30 have the facts, but let me, let me, let me, let me see if that's true. Spanish flu, Wikipedia.
00:27:37 I believe it, it's called something else now, but I think the Spanish flu also known as the 1918
00:27:42 flu pandemic wasn't unusually deadly, blah, blah, blah, blah. Thing about the Spanish flu is it
00:27:47 did not come from Spain. It came from America. All right. Why is it called the Spanish flu?
00:27:54 Maybe just it got there and that's what's best known for being. Honestly, like, okay,
00:28:00 I'm not an expert on this, but I have heard it said that like people called it the Spanish flu,
00:28:05 like specifically to like, oh, okay. I guess it was first reported in Spain,
00:28:13 but it didn't come from, but it didn't come from Spain. All right.
00:28:16 I think it's more just like the zeitgeist of culture, you know, like, like the coronavirus is
00:28:20 obviously associated with China because that's where it fucking got its start and shit.
00:28:27 People are like, oh, it's not, but it's not racist just to call it the Chinese virus.
00:28:31 And like, I agree. It's not in and of itself racist to call it that. But like,
00:28:37 the point is it's weird. It's weird. Don't you think that like it was called the coronavirus?
00:28:43 They've been calling it that for months and then all of a sudden Trump and other people,
00:28:48 they just, they pivot. They start calling it the Chinese virus. Did you see that picture?
00:28:53 There's a picture. You can see Trump's speech and he literally used a sharpie to cross out
00:28:59 coronavirus on and wrote Chinese virus. I saw that. I assumed it was fake. It's not fake.
00:29:05 He really did that. Can I get a source? It just seems, it seems so, like, if anybody would do
00:29:11 something like that, it would be Trump, but it just seems so ridiculous to me that you would,
00:29:15 why would you need to scribble it out? Couldn't you just remember? I mean, maybe I don't know.
00:29:20 I don't know. The thing is, the thing is, the people are mad, people are mad at the,
00:29:25 let me fucking finish, the people are mad at the libs for being like, okay, oh, it's not racist.
00:29:29 It's just calling it what it is. Okay, whatever. The point is not whether that phrase is racist.
00:29:34 The point is that calling it that is, like, clearly a manipulation of the thing. It already
00:29:39 had a name, but they've decided we need to give it a new name to transpose blame for the situation
00:29:44 onto China. That's clearly why they're doing it. And I don't appreciate it.
00:29:48 I agree. I agree. I think, I think in the case of Trump, if he did that, then yeah,
00:29:53 I think someone on Twitter just calling it the Chinese virus.
00:29:56 No, it was, I mean, it became a thing because Trump said it in the speech and then Trump said
00:30:01 in one of his speeches when like some lady asked him, like, if it's racist, he said, like, no,
00:30:05 I mean, clearly one of his motivations here was that he said that the Chinese government
00:30:09 attempted to spin this as actually an American virus that was like leaked by the American
00:30:14 government. And clearly he was very annoyed by that. And he's like, no, no, no, this is
00:30:19 a Chinese virus. Is that true though? I mean, that's what he said. I mean, why would you believe
00:30:25 anything is he says it? I mean, that doesn't prove it's true. But I mean, I've never heard that
00:30:30 fact disputed. I've just heard the fact. I will not believe I will not believe anything just
00:30:35 because Trump says it. It's just that I've heard no pushback on that point. I don't care other
00:30:41 points. I mean, that's not him saying it is not evidence of it being true. I'm not I'm not
00:30:46 asserting that it is definitely true. I'm saying that I'm saying that there's no reason to believe
00:30:50 it even could be true simply because he mentioned it. Also, a lot of people seem hung up on like
00:30:56 this is giving a bad name to the glorious Chinese people. I mean, I can sort of see that. But
00:31:01 isn't really the intent here to smear the government who is responsible for managing the
00:31:07 situation? I mean, I mean, I read it. I don't I don't think the attempt is to deliberately like
00:31:12 demean the ethnically Chinese. It's definitely like a political thing. Right. I mean, I mean,
00:31:19 to be fair, the Chinese are trying to pin this on the US by saying that the coronavirus started
00:31:25 in America and we're saying it was US military. I've never heard that. Is that this is the first
00:31:30 time hearing of that? If it's true, then so be it. A couple weeks ago, that was the Chinese
00:31:35 government's position was trying to shift blame to the US and saying it was like a military operation
00:31:39 that brought it in or something to that effect. So this is the government's doing the governments
00:31:47 pretending to be brainless when they're all working in a big interlocking system where
00:31:51 they're all at fault and they all need to be called. Just to give you a fact here, a data point,
00:31:57 I'm reading an article in The New York Times that says, this is just the title, China spins
00:32:01 tale that the US army started the coronavirus epidemic. So I don't know any more than that.
00:32:06 It's The New York Times seems reasonably credible. Well, then well, then maybe. Okay, whatever. Yeah.
00:32:12 The point is, I'm going to keep calling it the coronavirus because that's I mean, that was its
00:32:17 name. It's perfectly fair to me. Okay, Trump definitely calls it the virus just to annoy China
00:32:24 and I don't feel a particular need to do so. So I don't care. The actually people saying it annoys me
00:32:30 because people say like, oh, we name things after what they're they come from. Well, actually,
00:32:34 the World Health Organization says no, we don't do that anymore. Because sometimes we're bringing
00:32:39 it back, baby. Our official naming convention specifically preclude doing that.
00:32:48 So no, wrong. I'm sorry, we are bringing your fancy laws to the streets where we call in the
00:32:53 virus, you know, what it what it really is. I'm just, you know, I'm just I'm too by the book.
00:33:01 Ben, let's call it what it is. It's the kung flu. It's the kung flu. I know. Look,
00:33:05 in my heart of hearts, I know it's the kung flu.
00:33:09 Hey, hey, okay, but but I was also curious, we talked about the dang lectures. I wanted to
00:33:14 hear what you your debacle about your lecture about my trauma you sucked. Yeah, it was because I
00:33:22 I guess my headphones are bad because we had two. There were two audio tracks. One was from
00:33:29 the two floor mics. And the other was from the the lapel mic. Yeah. And I listened to both of them.
00:33:37 And like quality wise, I didn't hear that much of a difference. But this baffles me.
00:33:43 But for some reason, the that you guys talking was actually quieter relative to me speaking in
00:33:51 the floor mics in the lapel mics, you guys are actually like relatively louder. I don't know
00:33:57 how that could possibly be the case. Yeah. And yet it is. So I was like, well, since I don't hear
00:34:02 much of a quality problem, I'll just go with the floor mics, because like whatever, it doesn't
00:34:06 matter. So I released it. And, you know, in hindsight, actually, the quality of the lapel
00:34:12 mic is actually a little better. It's a little less tinny. But even, but it's not like a deal
00:34:16 breaker. However, I guess for some reason, the two floor mics were like out of sync with each
00:34:23 other. Like, yeah, waveforms were like, yeah, they were just like one frame off or whatever.
00:34:30 And so listen to in stereo, it didn't it sounded okay. But if you listen to it on mono,
00:34:37 the two signals because they were out of sync, they would like negatively cancel or I forget
00:34:43 what the phrase is, you know, the two waves would like cancel each other out. And so people said
00:34:47 it sounded like they were hearing me like as though I was speaking underwater or through a wall or
00:34:51 something. So, you know, most people didn't have it. And a lot of people were like, why are you
00:34:55 reuploading it? It's fine. It's fine. But like some people were like, this sounds like terrible,
00:34:59 like this is like unlistenable. Yeah, I couldn't I couldn't use the the mics for the audience,
00:35:05 because for some reason, as the lecture went on, the those ones desynced from
00:35:13 in my case, the video was very weird. In my case, and this is very frustrating,
00:35:17 in my case, actually, the lapel mic desync, it's not very much. But if you watch at the end of the
00:35:24 Kokoro wish lecture, you can see that like the audio is desync from the video by like,
00:35:29 a quarter of a second, like it's very minor. But if you pay attention, you can kind of see it.
00:35:33 Yeah, I mean, yeah, the whole last third part of my lecture, the audio drops in quality even
00:35:39 further, because I guess the lapel mic for the third recording just didn't work. So it was just
00:35:43 the camera audio. So it's just like, okay, it's just bad. It's not going to be good. It's gonna
00:35:50 we're gonna have to ride on the performance and the information because clearly the production
00:35:53 value is not you got him in for the first two hours. I mean, most people will coast. I ended up
00:35:59 I ended up I contacted our old friend oblivion fall to do I was like, first I wanted him to like,
00:36:07 hey, could you fix this like, this like phase issue that is like causing this cancellation?
00:36:12 And then he kind of did but then he was like, you know, the lapel mic sounds better. And I was
00:36:16 like, well, okay, can you just apply the lapel mic? And he was like, well, I want to do some
00:36:20 cleanup on it. I was like, okay, and then it took a while but then he did it. And then I got it up
00:36:25 and that was how that happened. But very frustrating, because the second release
00:36:31 did not get as many views as the first one. It did not it did not spike. I think it killed
00:36:36 some of its momentum to re upload it. It lost like, you know, like six 6.8 thousand views
00:36:42 that it had on the first one. Kind of a bummer, kind of a bummer. But whatever, what are you
00:36:49 going to do? I think we should do this. Shut the fuck up. I'm fucking talking. Oh my god.
00:36:58 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Holy shit. It's fine. No, I love you. I love you.
00:37:05 On the first release, on the first release, I did I went and I posted it on like every
00:37:10 fucking subreddit that it was even marginally related. I posted it in my discord, I posted
00:37:14 an rfck discord, I posted the link to the first one everywhere. And I don't know if it made that
00:37:20 much of a difference, but it clearly maybe made some because the first one got got a percent
00:37:26 more views by a bit. But I don't know if I have the energy to do that again. I don't know if I feel
00:37:32 I just I feel like embarrassed. I would feel embarrassed to do it a second time. I know what
00:37:36 you mean. I don't know how to pin it on the audience because people were complaining. I went back and
00:37:40 did this. He's fucking entitled viewers. Where where would I plug such a thing? I was thinking
00:37:46 like what what subreddits would I even post this on? The PCP subreddit. Yeah, it was already there.
00:37:54 It's already there. But like I went and the webcomic subreddit, the cringe subreddit. I did that.
00:38:00 I did that too. I posted on like 15. The based subreddit. Yeah. Is there a based subreddit?
00:38:07 There should be. Okay. I don't. Where do you plug a thing like this? I put it on 4chan.
00:38:15 I don't know. I just posted. I've made a thread on 4chan about it.
00:38:18 Go to our college and just be like, here's a university lecture for you guys.
00:38:23 There is. There is actually a subreddit for video lectures. It's not that big.
00:38:29 Wait, regardless, our slash lectures. I don't think about any of this because I'm a fucking
00:38:37 idiot. I mean, to be fair, it didn't make much of a difference for me, but like
00:38:44 this is the kind of thing that I worry about. I like to watch numbers go up. Indeed. Same.
00:38:53 You want to know something disgraceful? Yes. You want to know something disgraceful about
00:38:58 our friend Gibb and take? Oh no. Yeah. Ream him, Ben. Do you know what he's doing right now?
00:39:07 Jerk in his little dick. Worse. He is streaming ratchet and clank.
00:39:13 He's streaming right now. He is streaming right now. He must have forgotten. That piece of shit.
00:39:19 You know what it is? He keeps thinking, okay, yesterday he like pinged everybody two hours
00:39:24 before the meeting and like, hey guys, it's time for the meeting. I think his like clock or alarms
00:39:29 are just wrong. How fucking hard is it to fix that? I don't know. Well, I think he probably just
00:39:36 something got screwed when he like changed time zones when he came here or something. I have no
00:39:41 idea, but the boy needs help. It's gotten to his brain. It just seems like a very solvable problem
00:39:47 to me. We could. We could add him right now, but it's too late. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. It's possible.
00:39:55 I'm not gonna. You know what? You know what he should do? We didn't add everybody. We should.
00:39:59 Oh god. Oh, we didn't add everybody. Whoops. We should get him on the podcast right now, but he
00:40:07 should have us, our audio be audible on his stream. We should have this episode live on Gibbon
00:40:14 Gaming. Um, potentially doable, I suppose. Guys, here, I'll just add everyone. I got,
00:40:21 I got the best fucking comment right now on the Kokoro wish lecture. It is from Mike Smith.
00:40:29 Do you want to know what it said? Yeah, indeed. It said, Christ, you people are ugly.
00:40:34 He's not. Oh Christ. That's death.
00:40:43 My favorite comment on the Animarse lecture so far was just someone like yesterday say,
00:40:48 I know what you're going to say. This is the most unfunny thing I've seen in a long time or
00:40:52 something. Oh, I thought you were going to say the one about the circus, the four skins. Oh,
00:40:56 that one was great too. That was a nightmare fuel. Tell us that one time. Yeah. So somebody
00:41:01 commented yesterday on the Animarse lecture saying like, Oh, so you're saying when, when
00:41:07 everybody morphs back, all of their non-genetic injuries are healed from their base form. So
00:41:12 that means that all the man and male animorphs got their foreskin back, right? And I'm just like,
00:41:19 and all the women got their FGM reverse. I guess so. I guess so. I can't say you're wrong.
00:41:26 Female genital mutilation. Oh, right. My favorite. Yeah. Okay, cool. Cool. My favorite thing to
00:41:34 watch. Let's play is up. I can't cure this damn autism or this damn one-itis, the deadliest
00:41:40 mildest motor man. Shit. If only. Listen to purple glasses over here, making more misogynistic
00:41:49 comments. I'd never say the word because I hate women so much. Well, I mean, true.
00:41:55 Well, hey, so I'm, I don't wonder if you guys have done the same because I've been going through
00:41:59 my big ass long lecture and I have been, I'm going to go through it. I'm like, I'm, I'm getting pretty
00:42:04 close to being done. I should be done editing it two day. So it should be out by the time people
00:42:08 hear this. We know how my predictions go, but feeling pretty confident about this one.
00:42:13 And end of the month, people, end of the month. I've been doing that. Well, that's only two days
00:42:17 from now. End of the month, every month. Well, uh, uh, oh, so I've been going through the entire
00:42:24 thing and putting in images. I've really, this is almost my penance. It's my penance for, I feel
00:42:30 so bad about both the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy lecture, not adding in images, just things
00:42:36 to give context. I've maybe gone a bit overboard. But my, it's, yeah, my policy, I have been doing,
00:42:44 I did the same thing for, um, Kokoro Wish and I'm doing the same thing for, uh, Chris102.
00:42:49 My policy, and I haven't stuck to it a hundred percent, but like, my rule of thumb is I don't
00:42:56 show images of events. I just show images of a character or like a thing. Yeah, when the character.
00:43:02 And I have a general rule that's mostly, it's like the first time a character is mentioned,
00:43:07 I show them and that's generally. If there's something that you would need to end up to
00:43:11 visualize, like to, to understand what I'm talking about, I show that. But generally, I don't show
00:43:17 like, oh, this is, if I say, oh, and then this happened, show the panel where it happened.
00:43:21 No, I, some, sometimes I do. Because you want people to wonder and to use their imagination
00:43:25 a lot of the time. Yes. What things look like. Yeah. I have been, I have been considering,
00:43:30 like, should I do, should I do Chris, should I do Sonichu101 Remastered where I just put images
00:43:37 on screen? I thought of that too. I thought of that too. I don't know. Like, on the one hand,
00:43:44 like, one, would people care? Two, like, would it actually like, help anyone with understanding
00:43:50 what I'm talking about? Would anyone watch it? Would it like, yeah, I don't know. Well, the interesting
00:43:56 thing is that. It's a thing that I would like to exist, but I feel like if I were to release it
00:44:01 and nobody cared, like, it's, I wouldn't, there wouldn't, like, what would be the point?
00:44:05 Sure, sure. One of the things that I didn't expect would be so well received, because I just
00:44:12 blatantly copied it from the RFCK lecture, was having little audio cues when images popped up,
00:44:16 because I didn't even consider that people would just like tab over and do something else.
00:44:20 Oh, they will, no doubt. But of course they would. I consider that as well. There are too many
00:44:24 images, so I'm just bailing on that idea. It is a good one, though. It is a good one. Oh, the,
00:44:28 the dings? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I decided that there were too many images, and I wasn't going to ding
00:44:34 for everyone. The first render I did did not have the dings. Then the RFCK lecture came out
00:44:41 in between, and I already had an error I needed to fix. I was like, well, I might as well put
00:44:45 them in. I don't have any excuse now, so I did. That's smart. That's smart. I've also, as I've been
00:44:51 going through the whole thing, I have like my audio up and like, I have everyone else muted
00:44:56 for optimal audio quality. And then only at times when the audience speaks, I raise the audio of the
00:45:01 ambient noise and then lower it once they're done. I've done that through the entire thing so far,
00:45:06 and it's pretty much the most time-consuming thing of the whole project. But yeah, that's why I do
00:45:10 stick with it. I'm not sure if Oblivion mentioned wanting to do some of that. I don't know if he
00:45:18 ended up doing it. I didn't think that it, I don't think it was that big of a deal. It's going to be
00:45:21 a classic overproduced best guy ever video, no doubt. Yeah. The audio in Sonichu 101 is like
00:45:30 bad, and I get quieter and louder when I face the mic or away from the mic. It's bad, but it's got
00:45:35 a million views. Nobody gives a shit. It's true. It's true. I was looking at the lapel mic audio
00:45:42 for the Sonichu 102, and there's one side is clearly louder. The left channel is louder than
00:45:51 the right channel, and there's probably a really simple way to fix that or compensate for it.
00:45:56 Maybe I'll do it. Is rendering audio through Vegas bad? Does that make it audio bad? Should
00:46:06 I render the video in Vegas and then get the audio from another source and just apply it through
00:46:11 another program? I generally do that stuff in Audacity, but I've never been sure it's actually
00:46:18 necessary. I wouldn't, I mean, I don't think so, but I've always used Audacity like for this
00:46:25 purpose, so I can't tell you exactly. Yeah, but you can't render a video in Audacity. Oh, right.
00:46:30 Do you then put the audio into Vegas and render it in Vegas? I mean, sometimes, but only for
00:46:37 things that I don't really care about the quality of, just because I've been afraid it'll be worse.
00:46:40 So is what you're saying, that you do the audio in Audacity, you render the video in Vegas,
00:46:46 and then you apply the Audacity audio to the video through an external program? Yes, I have
00:46:51 done that many times. What program do you use for that? Well, Audacity. Audacity in Vegas.
00:46:58 No. What I'm saying, do you... Oh, you're asking how do you strip the audio from the video?
00:47:06 Yeah. I can't remember offhand. Well, if you want to get audio from... No,
00:47:14 you just said you do it. What do you do? Well, I mean, it's been a while since I last did it. Maybe
00:47:20 I did render just the MP3 or the like the FLAC file or whatever in Vegas to get the best quality
00:47:27 possible and then edit it in Audacity because I do that fairly frequently. No, stop. That doesn't
00:47:32 make any fucking sense. How would you render a video file in Audacity? No, everything I'm talking
00:47:38 about in Audacity is that I've stripped audio files from other projects in some way, like such as
00:47:44 rendering a FLAC file from Vegas or whatever, then you import into Audacity where I do lots of cleanup
00:47:49 stuff, then I move it back. Move it back? How? To Vegas? Move it back. So you put it in Vegas
00:47:56 and render it in Vegas? I mean, yes. Okay, thank you. Oh boy. All right, cool.
00:48:05 Just for future reference, you can save a step of rendering out a FLAC file. If you install the
00:48:10 FFmpeg extension for Audacity, you can just import video files and it'll just automatically grab
00:48:15 the audio file from whatever video you import and just dump it in there. That's the sort of thing.
00:48:20 Can you then put that audio onto a video file? No, you have to save it as an MP3 or WAV file and
00:48:26 then sync it back up. Oblivion Fallhead, I forgot what he said, the software, Oblivion Fallhead
00:48:31 software that could just take an audio file and just swap it into a video, like just just
00:48:38 something an audio guy would have. Just apply it to a video file without re-rendering,
00:48:43 which is pretty convenient, but I don't think it's free software though.
00:48:47 Anything's free if you know where to look. Maybe. That's true. Maybe.
00:48:53 Well, after this, I've got one more lecture to end. Well, I guess I'll just say, I mean,
00:48:57 I have been charged with the heightened responsibility of getting Brad's esteemed lecture
00:49:02 done, which won't that be a fun thing? He's got lots of useful information,
00:49:07 everybody, so stay tuned. Won't that be fun? Look in your sub-box in the old PCP.
00:49:15 What is the next lecture coming out? Whose lecture's coming out next?
00:49:18 I really think it's going to be mine, because I'm almost done.
00:49:21 Okay, cool. I am really looking forward to the response to Digi's lecture. That's the one that
00:49:30 I'm like. Yeah, that's going to be juicy. That's going to be juicy.
00:49:33 That's definitely true, but I'm the most hyped for Munchies, because Munchies was so much fun to
00:49:37 listen to, and it's fucking great. I mean, true, but also, have we said, should I say what it is?
00:49:45 Yeah, you said it. He's announced it. I wonder if people will not want to hear about real history,
00:49:53 as opposed to like- We need to sell them on it.
00:49:55 You've got to have a really insane title. Like, the French Revolution is the best anime you've
00:50:00 never seen, or some really dumb shit. That's pretty good. Honestly, that's probably the way to go
00:50:05 with the title. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he starts saying, he says, what does he say? He's like,
00:50:09 oh, history's boring. Actually, no, you're an idiot. I'll kill you. He says history is anime.
00:50:15 It's like the tagline, right? Yeah, he says it, yeah. That's why I said that.
00:50:19 Oh, right, right, right. Spoilers, Teehee.
00:50:23 Bring it out, Munchie. He probably pawned it off to a sweatshop laborer, Ethan, again,
00:50:27 and took six months to get the shit out. Maybe. He needs to be disappointed.
00:50:32 Munchie needs to be working on the Vaporette. That's true. We don't need this lecture. We need
00:50:39 the Vaporette. It is- Okay, Nexus is working on his. Jade Moreau told me yesterday that she was
00:50:47 going to work on hers. Don't know what's going on with Munchie and Kazes, but God, I hope soon.
00:50:55 I hope they'll be done soon. Who is done? Are there people who are done?
00:50:59 Cheesy Manfredo and Hippo are done. Good man, good man. Yes, yes.
00:51:04 My money is sitting somewhere. I've got- I want my product. I just want to give,
00:51:11 I just want to give these artists money. I just want to pay them for their work.
00:51:15 I just want to consume the product so I can clap and start waiting for the next product.
00:51:23 Yeah, true. Hey, you know, Ben said before, he wasn't thrilled with how his episode, or
00:51:29 you know, having to repost and whatnot, and that got me thinking. Maybe we should do a thing
00:51:34 where we sell DVDs of the lectures as one big box set after all of ours come out,
00:51:42 and people can fucking buy them and watch them. I think that's unironically a good idea.
00:51:47 One time, boy, that's a weird, weird to imagine, and yet I can't help but think it probably is a
00:51:55 good idea. Yeah, yeah. One time I downloaded some software, some DVD, like design software,
00:52:02 and I tried to, actually I probably made some progress with it. I tried to design a DVD menu,
00:52:10 and like a DVD design for the Nuzlocke genocide. Right, right. And it was really hard,
00:52:17 and really frustrating, and I think I abandoned the project. I don't remember how far into it I got.
00:52:24 I don't know. So, yeah, I mean it's a thing. It's a lost start, the DVD menu. Back in 2007,
00:52:30 I played around with iDVD on my Mac constantly. It was super simple. It worked great. I made
00:52:35 tons of DVDs of like all my pirated. Did you really? What did you put on them? I just put all
00:52:39 my pirated TV shows on DVD, so I could watch them on my TV. Did you make like menus? Yeah,
00:52:47 they had a quick, you just drag and drop some menus, you put some images in, and they just work
00:52:50 like, it was an Apple thing. Back when Apple was actually cool, and it was the easiest thing in the
00:52:54 world. Oh man. I want to make my Naruto DVD playing in the end, with a sick Naruto versus
00:53:00 Sasuke background. You could do that. It was super easy. You're fucking sick. Oh, and to press play,
00:53:04 you have to like press the showering gun on Sasuke's eye to start. Fuck yeah. I use using a
00:53:10 program called DVD Architect. Damn. I didn't enjoy the process very much. The Virgin iDVD versus the
00:53:20 Chad DVD Architect. No, I think it might be the other way around. Basically, it's cringe. Both
00:53:27 cringe. Yeah, yeah. I can't remember where I saw this. I just saw a video the other day. I mean,
00:53:33 I haven't fucked with a DVD in years, so it would never occur to me to create one. You know what
00:53:37 it was? I just watched Cinemassacre, the angry video game nerd, made a video about like, I forget
00:53:43 what else it was, but it was, among other things, like the lost art of the DVD menu, how they used
00:53:48 to be set. It was in the context of some bigger video. That sounds pretty cool. I feel like it's
00:53:53 completely about like a Blu-ray, and then I think it expanded to all his Blu-rays, and how he was
00:53:57 fucking sick of these awful, like basic bitch. Oh, I think I remember this video. I don't remember
00:54:01 what it was talking about. I don't remember which one it was, but I know I remember this point,
00:54:05 because he's saying like, it's just like a static screen. It's really boring and dumb. And they all
00:54:08 use like the same format, and it totally sucks. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to do a scan real quick
00:54:13 in this channel and see if I can find it. All right. What if we had a DVD box set or a Blu-ray
00:54:18 box set of the lectures, and then for like bonus content, we could have like, like the commentary
00:54:25 on the lecture. So like, if you already seen it. Commentary. Yeah, like commentate on the lecture.
00:54:30 Sure. Sure. Although some of those are pretty long. That'd be a long commentary track. Oh,
00:54:34 god. Like we would like record like a new like commentary track to play over it. Yeah.
00:54:41 It'd be a big ask, but it would be pretty cool. I mean, we're in the lecture. We're asking questions.
00:54:47 Yeah. They have actors do commentary on movies. They're in all the time. This is standard DVD
00:54:51 Extras 101. But like, we were doing the commentary in the video. We're there raising our hands and
00:55:00 saying stuff. Ben. Making comments. Ben. It's a joke, Ben. No. It's supposed to be funny.
00:55:08 Yeah. Well. Oh, wait. I got it. I got it. I'm sorry. I found the video. It's the top 10 reasons
00:55:12 Blu-ray sucks by Cinemastaker. That's the one. I will post. I can't wait. Get ready for our Blu-ray
00:55:18 box set, guys. Cinemastaker disapproved. No. We can put some stank on that menu. We can like
00:55:25 Munchy asks a question in the lecture and then in the commentary is like, yeah. So when I raised
00:55:30 my hand, I was really like, I was really concerned about a certain thing. You know, I'd heard, I'd
00:55:34 heard like, maybe we can provide one additional piece of content in such a DVD or Blu-ray box set
00:55:41 or something to like one secret bonus lecture. That would be a good place to float the short
00:55:46 lectures, like the remedial class ideas that we were talking about forever.
00:55:50 True. But like, we don't, we haven't made one yet. No, we're not doing one.
00:55:54 Remind me what the remedial lectures were about. We were just, we were just talking about like
00:55:59 trying to do short, like half an hour, 45 minute lectures that were just like, not a four hour
00:56:05 monster. Next, I want to do one big lecture. I've already got some ideas and I want to do
00:56:10 like one small lecture, like deliberately, intentionally, like 20 to half an hour minutes.
00:56:15 I was thinking, if we were going to do that, I was going to do this in general, but now they
00:56:18 were talking about the box set. Maybe I put on that like a mini lecture on the Animorphs TV show,
00:56:26 because it's so much different and it was so shitty, like a half an hour thing going through
00:56:30 that and being the changes and how like the budget fucked it over and all that crap.
00:56:34 You know what, Tom? I think someone said this, but I did think this was an amazingly good idea.
00:56:40 I don't know the, I'd have to do research. Maybe you're a better student for this, but a lecture on
00:56:45 all of the doom lore, because there is extensive lore of doom and it's fucking crazy.
00:56:52 Eternal, eternal canonized like everything, like all the dooms of one storyline now,
00:56:57 it's pretty ridiculous. Yep. I don't know, even analyzing retcons and stuff. The thing is,
00:57:02 my first doom, I mean, I played doom one back in the day, but like I didn't pay any attention to
00:57:06 the story. My first real doom was like 2016. So I mean, the story in doom one is like,
00:57:12 there's four paragraphs. Yeah, yeah, you're right. You know what's fucked up, man? Your rabbit's
00:57:17 dead and you're really mad about it. We were playing doom the other day or like a while,
00:57:20 a couple months ago. Why is the font so fucking horrible and impenetrable and impossible to read?
00:57:25 Like all the letters, the kerning is awful in the original doom and nobody talks about it,
00:57:30 but that's the real reason why that game is a zero out of 10. I can't read shit. Because a VGA
00:57:34 monitor when it came out was like high tech. I don't give a shit, man. Also, you don't give a
00:57:40 no excuse. Check your 2020 privilege, dude. Maybe I will. The banjo tui, which I played as I was
00:57:46 prepping from like the big banjo smash video or whatever, like the kerning again, of the font
00:57:52 at the beginning of the game, as it does like the text crawl, like telling you the story so far,
00:57:56 it like the letters are literally over each other. It's a nightmare. Why did they do it that way?
00:58:01 It's it was actually hard to read. I couldn't believe like this game is so good. So much love
00:58:07 and craft was put into every aspect of the game. But then these letters are like impossible to
00:58:11 read. It's a fucking nightmare. I want you I just want to show you what I was talking about before.
00:58:15 Look at the this is this is these are the views on the Animorphs lecture. Oh, there they go.
00:58:20 All right. It is accelerating. As I'm taught, it will reach infinity. You could say it's going to
00:58:26 the moon. If current trends hold, we will it will actually circle back around into infinity.
00:58:35 You know, on the lectures in general, in the next month, I've really been trying to
00:58:41 take stock of which one succeed and, you know, beyond others. I really think just the best
00:58:46 formula is like unexpectedly cool or unexpectedly interesting stuff presented with like a certain
00:58:53 reverence, and perhaps, you know, some some jabs of the thing, but with like a sincere love for
00:58:58 the thing. I mean, that's why people didn't know about. I mean, that's why I think that
00:59:01 the Kokoro wish lecture is the best lecture in why I should be doing these Iron Man numbers,
00:59:06 not you. I deserve those views. We got it. Yeah, we got to pump those numbers up. Well, Ben,
00:59:12 according to that one guy on Twitter, the Animorphs lecture was your win just as much as it was mine.
00:59:19 Oh, yeah, somebody said somebody's because I posted that I was like feeling bad on Twitter,
00:59:24 and someone responded like, but hey, you've got the animal, you did the Animorphs lecture,
00:59:28 and someone else was like, actually, Tom did that, and the guy responded like, yeah,
00:59:33 but Ben was like really contributing. I mean, it's not wrong. You could choose to see it like
00:59:43 that. Ben's Animorphs lecture really was success. There's no doubt about it. Ben's debut role as
00:59:49 the TA was really well done. Hashtag Ben's Animorphs lecture. Get a trending. That sounds good.
00:59:58 Everyone in the comments of the Kokoro wish lecture is like, I thought this was going to be
01:00:02 cringe, and you all said the same thing too after that. You were like, I thought this was going to
01:00:05 be cringe, but it was actually based. I can't believe it. It was actually cool. Yeah, I totally
01:00:11 stand by that. Yeah, I completely think that. The second year in a row, you've done that.
01:00:15 Last time with Tales of Gets Troll, we all thought that was going to be done, but it was actually
01:00:18 fucking lit. That's true. Tales of Gets Troll was the same. Although it's time to ask the hard
01:00:22 question. I think that perhaps there's a reason. Okay, Christian is obviously exponentially more
01:00:26 famous, but I think that there's a certain thirst for blood. I think the people, in a
01:00:31 sense, they want to see the person shit-talked. They want to see them reamed a little bit.
01:00:37 I think there's a certain hunger for that. I'm just not that interested in doing that.
01:00:41 Sure, sure. I go on every now and then I'll check the CWC thread on Kiwi Farms. I never went on
01:00:52 Kiwi Farms, but back in college, I would check the Something Awful forums, which was where the
01:00:58 hotbed for Chris discussion back in the day. Kiwi Farms seems basically similar, maybe a bit more
01:01:04 mean-spirited, but it is so boring. It is so lame. Here, let me fucking peep some right now.
01:01:15 Okay, sure. This is the state of default, just negative shit-talking. It's like,
01:01:22 oh, Chris is a lulcow. I'm going to misgender them because they're hypocrite or whatever,
01:01:28 and they're bad. This is moralizing. Okay, god, there was a...
01:01:37 There was a... Oh, god. You're losing me, man. I'm really... I know. Okay, here we go.
01:01:43 Someone says, oh, for sure. No sapient being that's even remotely in their right mind, in any
01:01:49 dimension or reality, would ever enter willingly into a loving relationship with Chris, not even
01:01:54 his hedgehog abominations. He has nothing to offer anyone, so unless they were being blackmailed or
01:02:00 were enslaved or forced into it some other way, every one of them would run far, far away from
01:02:04 Chris. That's arguably Chris' biggest delusion, and they're talking about his marriage to his
01:02:10 tulpas or whatever. Right. And then something about the idea, guys. I agree. That's why I just
01:02:16 can't feel pity for Chris. For the most part, he has only himself to blame for his situation.
01:02:21 It was his shitty life choices, laziness, will for ignorance, stubbornness, and forcing away
01:02:26 anyone who doesn't kiss his ass and humor his delusional crap that brought him to his current
01:02:30 situation. What was the idea, fags, did to Chris shitty and cruel? Yes, but it was Chris who chose
01:02:37 to ignore reality for comforting lies. This is the state of Chris Chan discussion as it is now,
01:02:43 and I want no part of it, because not only is it like gross, imagine 1500 pages of a thread
01:02:50 that are like that, just like pointing out, here's what, just like just stewing and like,
01:02:56 I hate Chris so much, let me just say over and over and over again what I think is wrong with
01:03:00 her. Yeah. Right. It's boring. Not only is it mean spirit, it's boring, and I hate it. It's definitely
01:03:05 boring. I don't want to fucking do it anymore. I don't want to be a part of that. Well, I mean,
01:03:09 I think the good, the great thing about the lectures, and I think the reason why they
01:03:12 resonate so much is that they come from an authentic place for all of us, like we all
01:03:18 choose topics that we're legitimately invested in, and it's not like an ironic, like, haha to he,
01:03:24 which is why a lot of the times, you know, when people make great suggestions for lecture topics,
01:03:29 like, I don't act on them because like, I have no reason, I'm not into it. Like someone's like,
01:03:35 oh man, this is like such a great lecture on anamorphosis, you got to do K Apple Gates
01:03:39 Everworld series next. I'm like, yeah, never read it. Never read it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's
01:03:45 just like, like, like, it has to, it basically has to be something that like we're already interested
01:03:51 in that we've already spent like our life, you know, thinking about and reading about and we,
01:03:57 you know, like, to do a lecture, I mean, I guess you could just like go look up something you've
01:04:02 never heard of, like, like do some research and present a lecture on like you could do that.
01:04:06 Yeah. But like, it wouldn't be different. Yeah, we totally know what makes the lectures
01:04:12 are like good is like the tangible details. And a lot of those, I mean, we were saying that the
01:04:17 other day, it takes a lifetime to prepare for a lecture, and then 30 minutes to like, you know,
01:04:21 arrange the board, or whatever, you know, actually hours, but you know what I'm saying.
01:04:26 And like, it's the tangible details that like, for example, I mean, I'll just say I'm doing one
01:04:31 piece, you'll be out by now, you'll see it. Like if you hadn't read the SPS's, there's so many
01:04:37 amazing details that like as I'm going through an editing right now, yeah, that's like, that's a big
01:04:42 little details that people don't know. Like the fact that Sanji doesn't get burned by his fiery
01:04:48 Diomeli Jambi technique, because canonically, while his leg is hot, his heart burns hotter. So
01:04:54 that doesn't even make sense, but it's the exploration. And it's great. Yeah, that's the
01:04:59 kind of shit in my mind that makes the lectures good. Definitely. Man, great stuff. I want,
01:05:09 I want the Kokoro Wish. I think Kokoro Wish is just as interesting as, say, Tails, I think
01:05:16 Kokoro Wish deserves to do as well as Tails gets trolled. It might not because of like comparable.
01:05:22 It might not because of lower name recognition. Would you say Kokoro Wish doing well is your
01:05:27 Kokoro Wish right now? Yeah, I would say so. Yeah, I would say so. Definitely. I don't know.
01:05:36 Shit, I feel like I had more to say about that, but I've kind of, I've kind of lost the thread.
01:05:40 No matter. No matter. I don't know. We've been talking about that for a while. We can go to the
01:05:45 voicemails if you want. I was gonna say about the mini lectures. I feel like people tell me to do
01:05:49 Oolulilia. I would do, I had kind of thought maybe I could cram in Oolulilia into Radcon 4.
01:05:55 It didn't work out, but I think that that would be a short lecture. I think it might be under an hour
01:06:00 because, I mean, I focus on like the work that they've done. Like, I can talk about Oolulilia
01:06:08 and how he's like a weird guy with OCD and all these like strange personal habits,
01:06:12 but it doesn't really take that long to explain. I would mostly be talking about his books,
01:06:18 and he's written two books, and they're pretty simple, and they wouldn't take like a huge amount
01:06:23 of time to like summarize. You know, they've got their funny moments. They've got their funny,
01:06:28 funny bits in there. Yeah, that's the stuff people want to hear. I think it's worth doing.
01:06:32 Oh yeah, yeah, I would do it, and at Radcon 5 I probably will, but it'll be short. It won't be
01:06:38 like a two hour lecture. I've heard suggestions for like a budget. I mean, I'm interested in what
01:06:43 people are, you know, want to hear and stuff. Like somebody the other day, because I think I was
01:06:46 on stream and I just said, I was talking about how much I love Legend of Dragoon. Someone's like,
01:06:49 do a Legend of Dragoon lecture. I was like, okay, I mean, first of all, Legend of Dragoon does have
01:06:53 some cool lore. We're talking about one game. Yeah. And there is some cool stuff about like,
01:06:59 did you know, I just learned this the other day, that apparently Dart was like the next character
01:07:04 being considered to be included in the PlayStation All-Stars right before the game got like canned
01:07:11 and they stopped making like new characters for it. That would have been wild. That's too bad,
01:07:15 because that was the one character I was really hoping to see is maybe a preference to like a
01:07:21 revival of the series, because I really do love that game and stuff. But I mean, and then there's
01:07:25 other ones like, I mean, Metal Gear, people have suggested, now that would probably be better,
01:07:30 because there's lots of crazy lore in there. And like the real life drama and stuff,
01:07:33 that could be pretty interesting. But I mean, yeah, it depends on how you want to do it. But
01:07:39 I mean, who knows the real lore of like the first two Metal Gear games, something about Gray Fox,
01:07:44 you fight him, Big Boss, Zanzibar, I don't fucking know. Metal Gear is a good, is a pretty good one.
01:07:48 It's a good idea. Yeah, like the thing about the lecture, I think the lectures are, they benefit
01:07:55 if the thing you're talking about is something that you could, that you would benefit from additional
01:08:00 context for other than if you just, like if you just play a Dragoon, you would know everything
01:08:05 there was to know about Dragoon. Like Kokoro Wish and stuff, it's like, well, there's like,
01:08:11 there's context about the author that helps, that is interesting and informs the work.
01:08:18 Michelle just made the best fucking tweet I've ever seen in my life.
01:08:22 Did she? What is it? Did you see, yesterday I posted a tweet that said three stage evolution,
01:08:27 and it was my three faces from the three radcons. Yeah, yeah. And how I've, I look way different
01:08:33 in everyone. She just tweeted three pictures of a spinel. There's like pre, pre, like happy
01:08:42 spinel, like sad spinel from the garden, and then like, like evil spinel. Yeah. That's supposed to
01:08:49 parallel my journey, and I think it is pretty much accurate. That's good. Way to go, Michelle.
01:08:56 Okay, okay. I think I'm done. I think I'm done talking about that.
01:09:01 I'm pretty, I'm pretty tapped in general. We could just move on to voicemails now,
01:09:05 if you want. We got them. That's fine. Yeah. Okay, let's do it. Let me see. Got them pulled
01:09:11 up right here. Okay, everybody, of course, you know, go down and click on the link to the speed.
01:09:17 Wait, I want to very briefly, I do want to expand on something that I mentioned last time.
01:09:21 Last episode, I said some stuff about how I thought makeup was cool. On reflection,
01:09:28 I think what that is, is that I just like the idea of being like an edgy goth teen and wearing
01:09:34 eyeshadow. I think, I think just being goth is what I like about it. Hashtag not gay.
01:09:40 I think they, I think that was the appeal on further reflection. Okay, fair enough. Just for
01:09:46 me to quickly mention something. I just want to be the front man of an emo band. I disavowed
01:09:50 everything I said about Droom Eternal last week. Droom Eternal is great. I love it now.
01:09:53 Oh, yeah. I wanted to mention that because I saw you change your mind about that or say something
01:09:58 online about how much you like DOOM Eternal. What sounds like, I mean, you got to the end. I'm
01:10:02 right before the last area. You had some issues with the last boss and stuff or whatever. I still
01:10:05 think boss fights aren't that great. Sure. Because I have a whole video coming out in like two days.
01:10:11 Do you like waiting for the Marauders eyes to flash before you can shoot the fucking axe, man?
01:10:15 The Marauders didn't kill me once. I don't know what everyone's bitching about. What? Oh my god,
01:10:19 I died so many fucking times to those guys. I'm playing, I'm playing on normal though. I know
01:10:22 everyone is playing on ultra violence. I'm not. I'm playing, I'm playing on not easy,
01:10:26 the one above it that looked hard enough. So that's probably the same as you. Yeah. Yeah.
01:10:30 I've killed, I killed all the Marauders without ever dying to them once and I felt like a god
01:10:35 because of it. Shocking, based. Well, yeah, you're good. You do video games, clearly.
01:10:42 He is video games, you fucking idiot. Courses through my veins. So what changed your opinion?
01:10:47 Game stops in essential service. I remember we talked about how I like to talk to my
01:10:53 Twitter and you didn't like it. What changed? I'm going to change my Twitter handle to Game
01:10:57 Stop is an essential service. Good idea. Great idea. So tell me, Tom, what was your thought
01:11:03 process? Well, you can, I'll have a link to the I Am Games video that goes over everything in the
01:11:11 description when it's up because at this time recording it's not. But it's just like coming
01:11:16 to grips with, OK, the first thing that I realized that I did not know for the first like three or
01:11:22 four levels is that unlike Doom 2016, the chainsaw is constantly recharging. So you almost always
01:11:27 have at least one charge. Oh, I didn't even know that. OK. And that changes the entire dynamic
01:11:31 of the game because in 2016 you hold on to your chainsaw charges unless you really need ammo or
01:11:38 if you want to take down big enemies. But in this game, like because your ammo capacity is so much
01:11:43 lower, you're supposed to be chainsawing constantly. So I noticed that the whole flow of the game
01:11:50 starts to click because you're like, oh, that's why there's ads in every encounter because
01:11:55 they're ammo boxes with legs. I get it now. Yeah, that's true. I noticed in one of the loading
01:11:59 screens, it specifically said there's like a four, it's like a list that's like, OK, like,
01:12:04 well, I forget what it's called. But what's it called? When they glow yellow and you do a kill,
01:12:09 get health. Brutal. Yeah, like it's like a brutal kill for for HP, you know, like flamethrower
01:12:16 for armor, chainsaw for ammo, and then like bloody punch or whatever to build up whatever the I
01:12:21 don't know whatever the fuck it is. Actually, you you do brutal kills to build up your bloody punch.
01:12:25 So like they're they're clearly they're trying to get you into a flow of using these like in
01:12:29 rotation to keep all your stats up and keep your health up. You need to use everything. I really
01:12:33 enjoyed that. And once you do, OK, the best fucking thing, like the game basically becomes
01:12:38 first person Devil May Cry once you have everything unlocked, because like you can like
01:12:42 double jump and then double dash and then meat hook all the way across and like,
01:12:46 then like super shock on someone in the face, turn him into Gibbs, then you land and turn
01:12:49 around and you can blood punch and they turn into Gibbs. It just you can make an encounter just a
01:12:54 nonstop sequence of increasingly cathartic violence. And it's 10 out of 10. It's great.
01:13:02 Except for the parts that are awesome. What's your favorite weapon? Just a curiosity.
01:13:05 Dude, the meat hook and the super shock and so good. Yeah, it's good shit.
01:13:09 Like I I feel I feel a little bad. I feel like I'm missing out not playing Animal Crossing during
01:13:16 the the quarantine. I also want to play it, but I haven't been Doom yet. My my roommate has it and
01:13:22 like I could play it if I wanted to. But like, I don't know, on the one hand, like it's such a
01:13:27 time sink. Yeah, on the other hand, but like everyone on Twitter is doing it. And it's like
01:13:32 it's someone said that like us play like it's the opposite energy from that one summer where
01:13:39 everyone was out playing Pokemon Go. It's very now is everyone is at home playing Animal Crossing.
01:13:45 Hey, I heard though, this may be of interest to you if you're considering playing on on someone
01:13:48 else's switch specifically, because I heard that like there's only one island per switch. So even
01:13:54 if you made an account, you'd have to like share the land with that person. What? That's why I heard
01:14:00 a different account that doesn't that's that was like an annoying thing that like Nintendo,
01:14:05 I don't know. They I don't even know what the point of it is. That would be very weird if true.
01:14:10 I haven't explored it, but that's what I had heard and it made me dubious because me and
01:14:14 Michelle were thinking of getting it and splitting it. I was planning on getting Animal Crossing
01:14:17 now that I'm done with Doom. But then I watched Jim Sterling video on it and he said that there's
01:14:21 item degradation and items break out the time. And that made me not want to play it anymore.
01:14:26 Like what? Like your chairs and your furniture and shit? Just like, I don't know. They're just
01:14:30 like, he's just said like, yeah, there's like your, your like, your tools, your tools all break
01:14:35 and shit. I'm like, I'm not fucking with that shit. Maybe I'll play. That's not, that's not so
01:14:41 bad, though, because those can be replenished. And none of those are, you don't get like legendary,
01:14:45 like golden shovel or something. His like, his, his, his video basically broke it down to saying
01:14:51 that like Animal Crossing has always been like a grindy game, which I'm already not a huge
01:14:56 fan of, but he's like, Nintendo just makes everything more grindy in this one. And I'm just
01:15:01 like, I'm out. The point of Animal Crossing is the grind. Right. Which is why I've never played
01:15:05 an Animal Crossing game and why apparently now I definitely never will. Sure. Sure. What's a shame?
01:15:13 The guys are, what, what if you shipped Isabelle and Doom guy? Cause what if game was in same game?
01:15:18 Oh God. Yes. I'm coming. What if Gabe and Tycho found themselves trapped inside their favorite
01:15:23 video games? I don't even want to think about that. All right. Let's, let's do voicemails. We got
01:15:29 voicemails over here. Yeah. Let's do it. Gamer news covered. All right. As we said, speak pipe,
01:15:34 link in the description, leave us voicemails. If they're good, we'll play them. That's what you
01:15:38 get. Okay. First up, we've got Girona question as a corona question, I assume. Let's hear what he
01:15:47 has to say. Okay. On the count of three, hit play. One, two, three, go. Ayo, shots out to all my
01:15:53 needs out there hooping on this living in pod, eating bud, wave for a minute before this corona
01:15:58 quarantine should happen. My question to the PC people is, what's the most unexpected difference
01:16:05 or like alteration that you've noticed in your life as a result of like this quarantine or like
01:16:11 just Girona panic in general? Make sure y'all stay safe out there and keep sipping on that pure
01:16:17 out piece. Just sit back in a nice bubble bath and a tall flute full of a hand sanitizer.
01:16:27 I think we've, I think we touched on this already. The biggest difference for me is not that I'm
01:16:31 doing anything differently, just that I feel worse about it. Yeah, I pretty much agree.
01:16:36 Cool. I love to feel bad and it's been a great excuse. Oh, well, actually,
01:16:44 my roommates are all home more now. They're all like working from home more or just not able
01:16:50 to work because of it. And the result is that there's more, they're playing board games all the
01:16:55 time. And I've been playing some more of those occasionally, not that often, but once in a
01:17:00 while. So yeah, I guess that is a little different. Playing a game called Gloomhaven.
01:17:07 I've wanted that one. I want to try that. I haven't played it, but I've heard good things.
01:17:11 It is, Gloomhaven is weird. It's like, it's, it's like continuous. Like you buy Gloomhaven and you
01:17:18 don't like play discrete games of it. Like every time you play it, you like change the, like the
01:17:24 game itself, like it comes with this big map. And when you like do missions in the game, you might
01:17:29 unlock like a new area and then you'll take a sticker and like put it on them. Like you'll
01:17:33 uncover a new area and you unlock classes by like fulfilling quests with your current classes.
01:17:41 I, the character, the only character I have played thus far is a, he is a little psychic ratman.
01:17:48 Actually, this is funny. Sounds like you, man. Yeah, he's a little psychic ratman from the sewers.
01:17:53 And he basically, he basically, he kind of like just kind of skulks around and he like tries to,
01:17:59 he like in limited ways, like mind controls enemies, like makes them attack each other or
01:18:03 makes them move or makes them do stuff. I'm pretty bad at it, to be honest. But his,
01:18:10 his, his quests that I drew randomly is to, he wants gold. He just wants to accrue 200 gold.
01:18:17 And that's, once he does that, he'll have unlocked a new class by
01:18:20 finally afford that operation.
01:18:24 And, but so, so in encounters, like everyone else, like everyone else would be like, oh,
01:18:30 okay, I'm going to heal the party. Oh, okay, I'm going to like stun everyone. So they can,
01:18:33 okay, oh, I'm going to like get, hey, guys, move everyone into arrangement. Guys, be sure to like
01:18:38 move, don't go here, don't go here. I'm going to do a big AoE attack. I'm going to like, I'm going to,
01:18:42 you know, like, like do crowd control. And I'm like, I'm just going to let you guys do that.
01:18:46 And I'm going to like hang in the back room and like loot everything. Like fuck, fuck that,
01:18:51 like fuck the enemies. I just want money. I'm just here to get money. I will help you if it's
01:18:55 convenient for me. And you know what, it's fine. It's fine because if I unlock that quest, everyone
01:19:01 benefits, right? Good. Yeah, sure, sure. Makes sense. Yeah, that's my goal. Also, I named, I have a
01:19:07 backstory for my rat. I named him target practice because the idea is that he was like a little,
01:19:15 like freak, like in like a city or something, like in the sewer drains or whatever. And like the
01:19:20 local kids, whenever they'd see him, they would throw shit at him because he's gross. But he didn't
01:19:25 like speak English well. So he would hear them say, they would yell target practice as they threw
01:19:29 things at him. And he thought it was his name. That's charming. Thank you. I like that. It never
01:19:36 comes up in game, but I thought it was cute. In answer to the guy's question, not much is changed.
01:19:42 But soon he'll have 200 gold and he'll be able to buy and sell all those kids on the black market.
01:19:46 That'll be great. We're all looking forward to that. Not much. I've done a little more socializing
01:19:51 in the sense that my sister came to visit and she was here for two days and that was very nice.
01:19:55 Grace is a cool girl. Fun to hang out with. You're a dog. You're a dog and I'm sick of it.
01:19:59 And that was her claim to fame. Other than that, nothing's changed.
01:20:03 Yep. That's it. Based. Tom, any changes for you? Notable. No. Unexpected. Just
01:20:09 doing the same old, same old, but it's more annoying because things I can't, I got to worry
01:20:19 about wiping my ass apparently. I'll tell you, I'm running a little low on toilet paper. I'm
01:20:23 hoping there's going to be some in the store. That's the worst part is now I got to wipe my ass.
01:20:30 Never had to do that before. All of a sudden it became a big deal.
01:20:34 Everyone's shaming me on Twitter for not wiping my ass now that there's a pandemic going on.
01:20:39 Everyone's bitching about toilet paper. I'm just like Amazon.com, get a bidet.
01:20:44 Where in the constitution does it say I have to wipe my ass?
01:20:49 Negative rights or positive rights? Fucking big government.
01:20:53 All right. Let's go on to our next question here. This is from the unironic gang weed guy,
01:20:58 KK Corona with another K. How fun. All right. Let's check it out on the count of three. One,
01:21:05 two, three, go. Hey, PCP. It's everyone's favorite original voicemail character,
01:21:12 the unironic gang weed guy here to talk to you sheep out there. You normies think you have it
01:21:21 so bad because of social distancing. You celebrities having mental breakdowns in your
01:21:28 multi-million dollar mansions while we suffer. Bitch, please. This is what we introverted
01:21:36 enlightened version gang weed gamers deal with every single day, bitch. Gang weeders rise up.
01:21:45 The joke's on you. There you have it. I mean, just hard agree.
01:21:53 That's all there's to say. I saw a comic posted on Twitter by Ethan Cool. You know Ethan Cool?
01:21:59 Don't think so. Ethan with an EA at the beginning for some reason. Don't know.
01:22:04 He's cool. He's an animator. But he posted a comic that's like it's like a little neighborhood
01:22:11 being attacked by face eating reptile mantis people. And the news is like stay indoors,
01:22:17 stay indoors, world in peril. And his mom's got a shotgun and she's like I'm going out for groceries
01:22:23 now and the gamer kid is like stay inside. Don't mind if I do, right? Gamer heads, level up.
01:22:32 Someone's getting devoured out of the window. I laughed. I lulled. Oh, I'm lulling. All right,
01:22:40 let's move on to our next voicemail. Here we go. We've got a three-parter. This is from the Scooby-Doo
01:22:46 Mystery Murder Files presented by Rhythm I Asked Back. I'm a bit of a murder file myself,
01:22:52 if you know what I mean. Indeed, indeed. All right, let's listen to our intro track here
01:22:58 on the count of three. Here we go. One, two, three, go. Hello, it's me, your host. Holy,
01:23:06 not gone, Trump. You may call me the interviewer. You're probably asking yourself right now,
01:23:11 what the fuck have I gotten myself into? Well, let me tell you,
01:23:16 Bucco, you are about to listen to the best voicemail series ever. It's the best because it's hosted
01:23:22 by me. Holy, not Donald Trump. I have the best voicemails. Okay, let me lay it down for you.
01:23:30 Every week, I'll interview one of Scooby-Doo's victims, then Scooby-Doo himself, a fairness
01:23:36 or something. Okay. Also, viewers, aka the PTP, they're free to ask any questions on the
01:23:44 podcast. I'll answer them the following week. Don't come yet, the show is about to start.
01:23:50 Right the fuck now. All right, totally not Donald Trump. What's that? I have one question
01:23:59 right off the bat, which is how do you interview, if this is a murder mystery, how do you interview
01:24:03 Scooby-Doo's victims? Aren't they murdered? Presumably, not every victim is specifically
01:24:09 murder. Unless they're ghosts. Unless they're ghosts because it's Scooby-Doo and they like ghosts.
01:24:13 Well, that's true. That's true. That's gotta be it. There's your answer. All right, well,
01:24:17 let's listen up because we've got the creeper, not the Minecraft one, as they understand it,
01:24:22 but the Scooby-Doo one, who is a distinct guy, although he's also green. All right,
01:24:26 let's hear what he has to say. Here we go. One, two, three, go.
01:24:31 Welcome to the Scooby-Doo Mystery Biles. Our interviewee today is the creeper,
01:24:37 or do you prefer Mr. Creep? Creeper. Creeper, it is then. Now, could you tell us a little bit about
01:24:45 Scooby-Doo? Creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper. I see. You're saying Scooby-Doo
01:24:52 gave you the TSD so badly that that's why you have to talk in this way.
01:24:57 Creeper, creeper, creeper. What exactly did he do to traumatize you so much?
01:25:04 Creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper. He raped you in the butt. He must have been
01:25:09 paid for considering his massive doggy dump. Creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper,
01:25:17 creeper, creeper, creeper, creeper. He used his tail to rape your mouth simultaneously. You say
01:25:31 where it makes sense to die until you're coming and enjoying in the raping. It seems
01:25:36 to make the same circus. Creeper, creeper, creeper. I understand. It's hard. Some things are too
01:25:42 difficult to talk about. Creeper, creeper. Thank you for your time, creeper. Okay, there you go.
01:25:50 Thanks. Well, Trump. Now we know. It's totally not Trump though. It's not Trump. It's definitely
01:25:56 totally not. No, you're right. You're right. All right, let's check in with the rapist. Let's see
01:26:03 what Scooby has to say. All right, here we go. We gotta get both sides. We need to hear both sides
01:26:07 of this story. That's right. This is balanced, fair and balanced news always. Okay, here we go.
01:26:10 One, two, three, go. So, Scooby-Doo, we just got done talking to that creeper. Can you tell me
01:26:19 anything about what you did to that creeper? I raped him in the butt. He was real nice. Yeah?
01:26:26 Why did you rape him in the butt? We weren't just going to rob him, but then we found out he had no
01:26:31 money. Me and Donnie raped him in the butt to punish him. His wrath was real nice and tight.
01:26:38 Must have been a origin. It's hard to listen to. It's the first time you met Donnie,
01:26:42 wretch, but I'm sure it won't be the rest. It might be the times when you pick up on these days,
01:26:48 but he would enjoy your ass, waste or interviewer. I don't think you or Donnie will be getting any of
01:26:55 my booty anytime soon. I see you like to play horrible wretch or don't kid care of you. Enough
01:27:02 of that. Why did you leave the creeper alive? Too little time. Not enough fucking. Be shocked.
01:27:08 The cops showed up. And with that, that was just one of the other poll shows who lost its innocence
01:27:13 to the pause of Scooby-Doo. Next time, we meet another poll show on the Scooby-Doo mystery
01:27:20 modifiers. Same PCP time. Same PCP channel. There you have it. Episode one. Thank you,
01:27:30 interviewer. Good luck not getting raped. What an unfortunate state of affairs.
01:27:35 Yeah. This is not good that this is happening, but it is. Maybe big government can save us from
01:27:44 this as it can with all our problems. I can't think of any other mechanism that stands a
01:27:49 chance, frankly, about dealing with this travesty. More to come next week. Thoughts and prayers
01:27:59 for creeper. Yeah. He didn't ask for this, but we did spook those kids, so maybe he deserves it.
01:28:06 A popular opinion? He deserved it? Funny, funny. You know, we said we had to hear both sides of
01:28:11 the story, but they were pretty much the same. I committed a rape. I was raped. Yeah. I mean,
01:28:18 this is locking key right there. It checks out. Yeah, it does. It's credible. It's credible.
01:28:24 In a word, credible. Yeah. All right. Let's go to our final voicemail of the day, and we really
01:28:32 got to set this one up. All right. This is the one we've been waiting for. This is important.
01:28:36 This is a humble, Ugandan interviewer who has a series of pointed questions for the PCP,
01:28:43 and you guys need to pay attention, listen up, and get serious, because this is important.
01:28:47 Okay. So you're ready? All right. Here we go. Count three. Here we go. You got an interviewer,
01:28:51 take it away. One, two, three, go. Why are you gay? Thanks for this, everybody. That's the end
01:28:57 of the PCP episode for this week. Wait, I have an essay. I have a thesis written on this topic.
01:29:05 That's it. How did you read my Google Docs? I read the script of this episode. They're all
01:29:20 pre-prepared. This is a fake. We're tricking you. This is a friendship simulator in every sense.
01:29:26 It's all been carefully formulated. It's a focus group. Indeed. These are the optimal choices made
01:29:32 on every episode to optimize enjoyment and monetary returns. We're surging. Jesus Christ,
01:29:38 we need to get a sponsor immediately. We're surging. Yeah, yeah. We just had a rapist on our
01:29:45 show. Can't wait. The sponsorships are going to start rolling in. The viewers love it. It's hard
01:29:49 hitting journalism, goddammit. We neither confirm nor deny our support of rape. Please sponsor us.
01:29:56 Ray-Band headphones or whatever. It's Ray-Khan. You got to use the right names. Ray-Band sunglasses.
01:30:02 Also them. That's cool. I'm down for that. Anyway, leave your voicemails, everybody,
01:30:07 on the Speak Pipe link down below. There was a mere pittance this time, and that's perfectly fine.
01:30:12 If you want to leave them, go ahead. We'll check them out. This is decent. Yeah, this is fine.
01:30:16 This is a good number. I got no problem with that. That's it, everybody. That's it for this episode
01:30:21 of the Procrastinators podcast. We'll be back next week with another episode. In the meantime,
01:30:27 support the show and get bonus episodes. Oh, there will be a bonus episode out by the time you hear
01:30:31 this. Most likely. We have not recorded it yet. Whoops. I forgot about those. I forgot about those.
01:30:37 Shit. Patreon.com slash The Procrastinators. I'm sure it'll be great. You can count on that.
01:30:43 There will be like 36 fucking ones by the time you hear this. There's good. There's gold in them
01:30:48 hills. Indeed, indeed. So even if we can't think of anything good to do for this one,
01:30:53 even if we just slap this one together and shit it out, you know, it's fine. There's other gold
01:30:57 in there. No doubt. It'll average out to be good because of all the other good ones. Indeed, indeed.
01:31:03 Maybe we'll play Animal Crossing. Watch, go back. I laugh every time I remember the time when we
01:31:09 played poker and I c***. That bonus episode. Oh, shit. Spoilers. I spoiled it. Oh, you ruined it
01:31:15 for everybody. Bleep that out, Eleazar. Bleep it out. Bleep it out. It was funny. It was funny.
01:31:18 It was funny. That's my favorite. Of course, follow the news, updates, any Twitter posts.
01:31:24 Look, there's lots of rad content still coming out from Radcon 4 on the Twitter. So follow
01:31:28 at TPCrastinators. It all gets retweeted there and more news and updates. I've been seeing on the
01:31:33 Twitter like PCP, like highlight moments. Is that new? Oh, that's right. Of course. I'm so glad
01:31:39 you mentioned that. I forgot. Eleazar, at his suggestion, was like, hey, Nate, we should bring
01:31:43 back the PCB highlights. And I was like, yeah, so we all talked, we agreed. And so Eleazar has
01:31:48 been making little highlight bits on the PCP highlights channel, which there will be a link
01:31:52 to and you should go subscribe to because we're going to now, at least monthly, release more
01:31:57 PCB highlights of some of the best moments of the PCP historically. We've already got Nate's
01:32:03 legendary roller coaster story and his, I don't want to be a cog in the machine. We've got Ben's
01:32:09 Molly doing story. There's a bunch of other ones on there. There's the elephant masturbation
01:32:13 discussion. I'm actually going to give that one a retweet. Please do. That's relevant to my content.
01:32:20 And we're going to try to get more from everybody and have a good spread. Eleazar is the man in
01:32:23 charge. So if you're in the PCP patron discord, there is like a highlights channel in there.
01:32:30 Go post in there moments. You want to see highlighted and Eleazar will be looking there.
01:32:35 That would be great because I don't fucking remember. There's a lot of episodes. This is a show
01:32:40 to you guys, but this is just our life and it all blends together. Yeah, please. If there's like
01:32:46 moments like, oh, that was really funny. That is a thing that sticks out in my memory. Just tell
01:32:50 Eleazar, go in the patron lounge, be like, we need a highlight of this. Eleazar, this is good shit.
01:32:57 I think his name's at Facundo on Twitter, but put your link in the description Eleazar for
01:33:02 Twitter. If you want people, maybe you don't want people to. But for people to give you suggestions
01:33:06 for highlights, he's the man in charge. So that would be a good thing to do. But yeah,
01:33:11 more coming. We just released like four new ones. And yeah, we're going to try to get some.
01:33:15 I don't think he's Facundo. That might take his name on like discord or whatever it is. He's got
01:33:21 a name on discord or on Twitter. I'm sure he'll post it for your viewing pleasure. It'll be in
01:33:26 the show notes, I'm sure. Okay, there you go. So more highlights are coming and we're going to make
01:33:31 more. Give us suggestions. We love them and they're a great idea. And we want to get that
01:33:35 channel to 1000 subs already so we can make money off of them already. Jesus Christ.
01:33:40 BASED. Absolutely, absolutely fucking based. We've got to merchandise, man. With a podcast,
01:33:45 you've got to have highlights. You've got to have, I don't know, fucking merch and stuff. Jesus Christ,
01:33:49 let's make some money here. It's time to go. Let's do this thing. All right, there you go.
01:33:55 So more stuff coming. Add to your crossings on Twitter. Updates and whatnot. My lecture will
01:33:59 be out by the time you hear this. I have no doubt at this point, it's very close to done already.
01:34:04 We'll see if that comes true. And more stuff coming. We've got a lot more. More lectures,
01:34:08 more content, the big stuff working on, a certain diss track. We'll be getting together pretty soon
01:34:13 and you'll see that in your sub box when it stays. So there you go. I'm excited for all of us.
01:34:19 All right, that's it. See you next week, everybody. More PCP.
01:34:21 Eventually. There you go. All right, see you then. Bye.
