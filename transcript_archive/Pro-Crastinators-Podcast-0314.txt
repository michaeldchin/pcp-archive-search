00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 It went from cold enough that I have to put on pants over my shorts to walk around outside
00:00:19 to it's hot and I need to install my air conditioner soon.
00:00:23 And I don't like that.
00:00:24 Yeah, how does that happen?
00:00:26 The planets flying through space and then all of a sudden it's like completely different.
00:00:31 We're really in like one damn.
00:00:34 It's just like just a little bit closer and suddenly it's much hotter.
00:00:38 And now it's gonna be 80 degrees for the next two weeks or whatever.
00:00:43 Something, air currents, equator, sun rays, blah, that's how it works.
00:00:50 Yeah, you see the sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace.
00:00:58 Brilliant, dazzling.
00:01:01 Really fucking fat and should lose some weight.
00:01:05 You ever see, you know, what do they call it when the sun shoots out fucking photons?
00:01:12 Plasma jets and then they get trapped at the north and south pole.
00:01:17 The Aurora Borealis in this part of the country and this time of year.
00:01:22 Yes, at Astro Camp we would show videos about space to children and some of them showed, you know, the sun emitting,
00:01:34 I forget what it's called when the sun gives like a gust of like plasma out into space.
00:01:40 Solar flare?
00:01:41 I don't think it's a-
00:01:42 Coronal mass ejection, CME?
00:01:44 Yeah, I think that's it.
00:01:46 Yeah, not a flare, not a flare.
00:01:48 The mass ejection.
00:01:50 And we would show a video of like a 3D simulation of it like, ooh, the mass ejection is going through space.
00:01:58 Oh, but what's this?
00:02:00 The Earth's magnetic field traps it at the north and south poles.
00:02:05 How majestic.
00:02:06 And sometimes if the counselors are from like a religious school, they would say like,
00:02:12 you see kids, that weird magic thing that just happened, that was probably God.
00:02:16 That was probably God protecting the Earth, the magnetic fields.
00:02:19 Protecting the Earth from the gaze, that's right.
00:02:22 Right, first from the magnetic, first from the coronal mass ejection and then-
00:02:28 Wait, this is great, I'm a genius.
00:02:31 He's protecting Earth from the L, Bs, Ts, Qs and the Cs, M, Es.
00:02:39 All of the letters.
00:02:42 That's great, I'm great.
00:02:45 It's really cool seeing those videos showing like, because I don't think the Earth's been hit directly by a CME since like for about a, maybe not a hundred years or about that much.
00:02:58 I would imagine it's pretty rare.
00:03:00 Yeah, fucked up the Earth's magnetic field enough that like it started a few like fires and like electrical, not even electrical like stuff,
00:03:08 but like if you had like metal, like if you were holding a metal fork, you'd get like a little, little zap from it sort of thing.
00:03:14 Good fuck up computers, pretty bad.
00:03:18 If it happened now, which people think, people are like really worried, it would be like apocalyptic level if that happened,
00:03:24 but like, like, you know, all the electricity grids going out, but honestly, it'd be fine.
00:03:29 Because we have pretty good monitoring on the sun and like, I've looked into it and most places like, yeah, we'd have like a couple days warning.
00:03:36 We could, we'd just have to temporarily shut some, shut some stuff down and we'd be fine sort of deal.
00:03:41 Hmm.
00:03:42 So five whole seconds the internet didn't work the whole way around the world.
00:03:47 And that was it.
00:03:48 And see the YouTube video talking about it already.
00:03:50 All the nukes launch simultaneously.
00:03:52 Yeah, as, as, you know, the classic technology of needing electricity to not shoot the nukes as soon as the electricity fails, off they go.
00:04:02 Cause it's all, it's all linked, it's all hooked up to Facebook now.
00:04:05 You know, it all works on the app.
00:04:06 So it's a, instead of like two keys that like the president and the vice president have to insert in a big like desk and turn in at the same time,
00:04:15 they both just have to open up the app on their, on their, on their dang mobile phones and hit the okay button at the same time.
00:04:23 And it's just screws it all up.
00:04:25 It's a big mistake.
00:04:27 Yeah.
00:04:28 It's both butt dialed at the same time.
00:04:31 Cause they were doing a butt bounce and they had their phones in their pockets as they do.
00:04:37 Like you do.
00:04:38 Yeah.
00:04:39 Yeah.
00:04:40 Yeah.
00:04:41 Classic presidential butt bounce parties.
00:04:43 Those are very normal.
00:04:46 Welcome to the procrastinators podcast.
00:04:49 Welcome to the procrastinators podcast.
00:04:51 We're live and we're alive.
00:04:55 And what a time to be alive.
00:04:58 Ladies and gentlemen.
00:05:01 Hey, did you, did any, either of you watch the Eurovision song contest?
00:05:06 No.
00:05:07 I doubt it, but maybe, maybe it's a big thing elsewhere.
00:05:10 I'm not sure.
00:05:11 Not for me.
00:05:13 It's a, if you don't know, it's a contest that held across Europe where each country in Europe and also Australia for some reason puts forth a song,
00:05:25 dance number, and they compete to see who's the best one.
00:05:30 Nice.
00:05:31 And it's often very political.
00:05:33 And for the last like 10 years, the UK has consistently been in like the last few spots during Brexit or just around that time.
00:05:43 We got zero points, which is like, they have like a two tiered points giving system where every country votes.
00:05:52 They give like the judges from each country.
00:05:55 They have like a delegation and they also have the public vote from that country.
00:05:59 And we got zero in one year.
00:06:02 I think it was last year.
00:06:04 No, nothing.
00:06:05 It was crazy, but completely expected because nobody likes us.
00:06:10 But this year, this year, first of all, Russia was banned because of obvious reasons.
00:06:18 And Ukraine got a big voter turnout.
00:06:24 Everyone was voting for Ukraine.
00:06:26 They had a pretty good song as well.
00:06:28 And that won.
00:06:30 But second place was the UK, which is completely insane.
00:06:34 Oh, you got robbed.
00:06:35 You got robbed by those dang Ukrainians just because they had a war or something.
00:06:40 Well, it's funny.
00:06:41 I think the reason we got second place was because we were like helping.
00:06:46 Really?
00:06:48 I think there's definitely politics involved.
00:06:51 Man, it used to be about the music, man.
00:06:53 No, it never was.
00:06:55 It was never about the music.
00:06:57 Well, maybe it was at some point back in peacetime where people just like ABBA came from Eurovision.
00:07:03 That was like Sweden, I think.
00:07:05 They became big.
00:07:06 And that's like, oh, ABBA, you know them?
00:07:09 They're pretty big.
00:07:11 I can't remember any others that came from Eurovision.
00:07:15 I don't remember it always being political, but it's often got a lot of politics in it.
00:07:22 But the English song, Sam Ryder, I think, he had a good song and he was really fun and energetic
00:07:33 and people seemed to enjoy his presence.
00:07:36 And then also politics.
00:07:38 So it was just sort of like, it worked out.
00:07:40 And now I'm a nationalist now.
00:07:42 I love the UK because we won a competition basically.
00:07:46 We got so many points, the number went up so high.
00:07:49 And now I feel proud to have been born in some arbitrary location.
00:07:53 And it feels great.
00:07:54 Finally, something had to do it.
00:08:00 You know who felt proud to be born in a location?
00:08:03 It's that guy who shot all those people on Saturday.
00:08:06 Yeah.
00:08:07 Did you hear about that?
00:08:09 I heard about it.
00:08:11 I haven't looked into it yet.
00:08:13 It's pretty bad.
00:08:15 It's pretty bad.
00:08:16 It's about as bad as it gets.
00:08:18 Guys literally just like black people's existence in America is an act of violence against the white race
00:08:24 and they must die.
00:08:26 And that's it.
00:08:27 Supposedly.
00:08:29 I mean, I don't have this confirmed, but my friend told me about the shooting yesterday,
00:08:34 less than an hour after.
00:08:36 He livestreamed it on Twitch.
00:08:38 Supposedly this is the guy's Twitter account.
00:08:41 I mean, I don't have a source, but would be crazy if true.
00:08:48 No! No!
00:08:50 It's so true that...
00:08:53 What's that image?
00:08:54 Like the big brony in 2012 or whatever.
00:08:57 And there's like the two parts.
00:08:58 One is the nice castle, one is the evil castle.
00:09:01 On the left, it's like become trans on the right.
00:09:04 It's become white supremacist and there's no in between.
00:09:07 It's literally true.
00:09:09 There's no way.
00:09:10 There's no way.
00:09:11 It can't be true.
00:09:12 Ben, being a fence sitter once again, gotta pick one.
00:09:14 It can't.
00:09:15 Gotta pick Ben.
00:09:16 Possibly.
00:09:17 Never.
00:09:18 You look good with big titties, Ben.
00:09:20 That artist knew.
00:09:21 Damn good stuff.
00:09:22 Yeah.
00:09:23 Yeah, I know.
00:09:24 I know.
00:09:25 I might join in.
00:09:27 I might draw the both of you with big old boobas at some point.
00:09:31 No.
00:09:32 Please.
00:09:33 That would be...
00:09:36 That would be harassment, but maybe I like it.
00:09:41 That's harassment.
00:09:42 I think I'm gonna take it though.
00:09:43 Yeah.
00:09:44 It's not like I can do anything about it.
00:09:46 Ben, there's a subway sandwich confirmed.
00:09:52 Domino's Peach Subway Sandwich.
00:09:57 Fucking brands and sexual things combined.
00:10:01 I'm looking at this guy's Twitter banner.
00:10:08 No.
00:10:09 Oh god.
00:10:10 Nice.
00:10:11 Okay.
00:10:12 I'm over it.
00:10:13 All right.
00:10:14 Damn.
00:10:15 We were talking about space earlier.
00:10:17 I don't know if that's...
00:10:18 That was like before the intro, so I don't know if that's staying in or not, but...
00:10:22 Sure.
00:10:23 One of my topics is space related.
00:10:26 I don't remember if I've discussed this on the show before, maybe I have.
00:10:31 Big, funny fucking telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope is pretty cool.
00:10:38 It's the sequel to the Hubble Space Telescope.
00:10:42 Oh yeah.
00:10:43 Sure.
00:10:44 Crazy, crazy fucking piece of engineering.
00:10:49 I read about it on Wikipedia in like 2015 and even back then.
00:10:53 Wait, wait, wait.
00:10:54 Keep talking, but do a Tom Scott voice.
00:10:57 Tom Scott?
00:10:58 I've...
00:10:59 I've...
00:11:00 I've...
00:11:01 I can't fucking...
00:11:02 No, it's not too bad.
00:11:04 It's pretty close.
00:11:06 I don't know.
00:11:07 It's just this crazy fucking gigantic piece of shit in space that's really cool.
00:11:13 I like it.
00:11:14 Yeah, yeah.
00:11:15 And it started...
00:11:16 I'm in space and this crazy gigantic fucking piece of shit telescope.
00:11:23 It's so cool.
00:11:25 Yeah.
00:11:26 I saw a...
00:11:27 I saw a...
00:11:28 I saw a supercut of like Tom Scott saying like, I'm in blank location.
00:11:34 Yeah.
00:11:35 And it was...
00:11:36 And it was like...
00:11:37 The caption was like, this is like the level progression of a Kirby game.
00:11:42 And it's like, I'm here.
00:11:44 Like, I'm here in the rolling hills of Ireland.
00:11:47 I'm down here in the bowels of the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
00:11:51 I'm about to get shot with a gun.
00:11:53 I'm about to cross a street.
00:11:55 I'm here with John.
00:11:57 Say hi, John.
00:11:59 Yeah, I found it.
00:12:01 Yeah, the Kirby level with John.
00:12:04 Yeah, so we need Tom Scott.
00:12:06 I'm in space.
00:12:07 I'm about to fucking die.
00:12:08 I can't breathe.
00:12:09 But look at this funny fucking camera on this funny telescope.
00:12:13 All right, I'm curious.
00:12:15 This telescope looks like something that I saw...
00:12:18 Was it called again?
00:12:20 The James Webb Space Telescope.
00:12:22 So...
00:12:23 It looks like something I saw being talked about in a Smarter Every Day video.
00:12:29 Yeah.
00:12:30 But it might not be.
00:12:31 It was a...
00:12:32 Look at this honeycomb looking ass.
00:12:36 Destin from Smarter Every Day.
00:12:38 His dad worked on the telescope, which is really, really fucking cool.
00:12:42 Because this telescope's been in development for 20 years,
00:12:46 cost $20 billion or some shit to develop.
00:12:51 When I was reading the Wikipedia page for it in 2015,
00:12:54 when I first learned about it,
00:12:56 I was seeing all this shit about,
00:12:58 have I had to invent entire new camera technology
00:13:01 that was completely different from stuff that we had used before,
00:13:05 and then reinventing it again when they realized they could do it better.
00:13:08 This is the most fucked up looking device I've ever seen.
00:13:11 It has to look that way so that one,
00:13:14 they can fold it up and fit it inside of a rocket
00:13:16 because it's fucking gigantic.
00:13:20 I think the...
00:13:21 Yeah, the thing was like...
00:13:23 The things they need for it to be
00:13:26 is extremely lightweight and portable and compactable.
00:13:32 When you think of science fiction fantasy ships,
00:13:35 they're always a rigid structure.
00:13:39 People in science fiction are like,
00:13:42 well, in the future, you just take off and keep going
00:13:45 and gravity's not even really a big deal.
00:13:47 But in reality, things look so much weirder and more alien.
00:13:52 It's just really expensive to get something out of Earth's gravity well
00:13:57 and into orbit just because it just takes a lot of energy to do that.
00:14:01 Well, this isn't even in orbit.
00:14:03 This is at the Ville Grange point.
00:14:07 I think it's like a million miles away from Earth.
00:14:10 It's orbiting an empty patch of space
00:14:14 where the Earth's gravity and the Sun's gravity cancel out or something.
00:14:23 It's a weird thing,
00:14:25 but that giant metal diamond shape is a sun shield.
00:14:31 I think that's the thing that Destin, from Smarter Every Day,
00:14:35 his dad worked on the sun shield,
00:14:37 which is this huge complicated, unfolding sail that has five layers.
00:14:42 The gaps in between the layers have to be shaped perfectly
00:14:45 so that any radiation that is generated inside
00:14:48 will be directed outwards
00:14:51 so that way the telescope can be cold
00:14:53 because it has to be a couple degrees above absolute zero in order to work.
00:14:59 Because it's an infrared telescope
00:15:01 and if it has any heat, it'll start radiating itself
00:15:05 and it'll create noise.
00:15:07 Makes sense, yeah.
00:15:09 Yeah, so this launched in December.
00:15:11 I was fucking so hyped for it, everything went good,
00:15:14 and they've been setting it up,
00:15:17 unfolding it, unpacking it, aligning the mirrors.
00:15:20 And the first few images have started coming through
00:15:22 and they're fucking so good.
00:15:25 I'm going to post one of them here in a second.
00:15:28 This is actually a comparison
00:15:30 of an older radio telescope compared to this one,
00:15:33 so that's a little comparison video I made this morning.
00:15:39 The resolution on that is...
00:15:41 Dude, that res-
00:15:43 Pretty fucking crazy.
00:15:45 You can put that on the front cover of a video game about space.
00:15:50 Yeah, good.
00:15:53 And the video doesn't even...
00:15:55 When I made that video, I think the video was 1080p,
00:15:58 but I had to zoom the image out to only one third of a size
00:16:01 to even fit on 1080p.
00:16:03 It's very high resolution.
00:16:05 And you can see all these galaxies and stuff.
00:16:07 That's an extreme lens flare.
00:16:09 That's an interesting pattern.
00:16:11 Yeah, it's hexagonal, due to the shape of the mirrors.
00:16:14 That's why there's six.
00:16:16 And then the two smaller spokes are due to the arms holding up the mirror, I think.
00:16:21 Or something like that.
00:16:23 So that was from March.
00:16:25 And then more recently, there was another image I'm posting, a comparison.
00:16:30 It's just crazy how good the fucking camera on this is.
00:16:35 That looks so cool.
00:16:37 We're going to see so much fucking space.
00:16:39 We're going to be able to see galaxies we've never seen before,
00:16:42 because it's infrared.
00:16:44 It can see all the really far away early galaxies that have been redshifted.
00:16:50 It's just going to be really cool.
00:16:52 And I can't wait for them to start doing science with it,
00:16:54 because I'm a big fucking space head and a nerd and a piece of shit.
00:16:58 And I love this stuff.
00:17:00 I guess I didn't really know that about you until fairly recently.
00:17:04 What a nerd.
00:17:06 I'm a big space nerd.
00:17:09 You like large celestial bodies and large women.
00:17:13 Large celestial bodies.
00:17:16 Cool.
00:17:19 Funny voicemails last week.
00:17:25 Oh, with the Celestia, with fucking Ben St.
00:17:29 Yeah, that was great.
00:17:31 Right, yeah.
00:17:33 Perhaps the saga will continue.
00:17:35 Celestia's hot, though.
00:17:37 Phantom horn, I think so.
00:17:40 I agree with Phantom horn.
00:17:43 Phantom horn would be hotter if
00:17:47 he had big fucking tits though, let's be honest.
00:17:49 Sure, I mean, absolutely.
00:17:51 No argument here.
00:17:53 No arguments.
00:17:55 Speaking of large things,
00:17:57 was that image of the black hole that came not so long ago?
00:18:02 Was that from this, or is it from something else?
00:18:05 No, that was from...
00:18:07 I forget what the telescope's called.
00:18:09 The telescope is an amalgamation of the entire Earth being used as a telescope.
00:18:17 So yeah.
00:18:19 That was a picture of the black telescopes.
00:18:23 That was a picture of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, right?
00:18:27 I feel like a couple years ago, I saw a very similar picture.
00:18:31 Yeah, okay, okay.
00:18:33 So there's two black hole images, the one from a couple years ago
00:18:39 and the one from a few days ago.
00:18:42 The first one I posted is from the Milky Way.
00:18:44 That black hole is about a thousand times smaller
00:18:48 than the one from a few years ago, but it's also a thousand times closer.
00:18:51 So they look about the same size.
00:18:53 I see.
00:18:55 But because it's smaller, the stuff orbiting it is moving way faster
00:18:59 relative to what we're looking at, which is why it looks blurrier.
00:19:02 Hmm.
00:19:04 But yeah.
00:19:06 Those three little things are moving around.
00:19:08 Yeah, those blobs.
00:19:10 That's the accretion disk that everyone's always talking about.
00:19:14 Yeah.
00:19:16 Yeah, and due to the gravitational distortion,
00:19:19 it pretty much always looks like a ring no matter what angle you look at it from,
00:19:23 which is wild.
00:19:26 But yeah, so the way that works is they have a bunch of radio telescopes
00:19:30 all over the world at different locations,
00:19:34 and they basically have all the telescopes look at the same patch at the same time.
00:19:38 As the Earth is like rotating over a period of like maybe six hours.
00:19:42 So basically each telescope across the world kind of traces a line through the sky
00:19:47 as the Earth rotates, and they kind of combine all of that information
00:19:51 to create the final image at the end.
00:19:56 So is that because if you look at a black hole, you'll see nothing?
00:20:02 Because it's a black hole?
00:20:05 Well, the reason they do take the image that way
00:20:10 is to get the resolution required, because it's so far away
00:20:14 that you need a telescope the size of the Earth in order to be able to see it.
00:20:19 Could the James Webb one take a picture like this?
00:20:24 The James Webb, I mean, earlier posted an image of the size of the mirror.
00:20:30 The mirror's not big enough to resolve something like that.
00:20:33 Oh, you mean like all of the telescopes on the surface of the Earth
00:20:38 like making up like together they like create a telescope
00:20:45 sort of that is the same like size as the Earth,
00:20:50 and that's like a big circle now using that?
00:20:53 Yeah, basically.
00:20:56 It is a really good Veritasium video recently that explained it.
00:21:01 This is our B-hole?
00:21:03 B-hole, exactly.
00:21:05 Very mature. Let's try to be serious about this, shall we?
00:21:12 Hmm, this is just like Spore.
00:21:16 You're just like Spore.
00:21:18 We have the greatest game ever made.
00:21:21 I can't believe Ben St was a Spore creation that got out of the machine.
00:21:27 It's fucked up that I did that.
00:21:29 It is fucked up.
00:21:31 What the fuck?
00:21:33 At 10 minutes 30 seconds you can see like each telescope for reasons can only really see like a band of lines on its own,
00:21:40 but when you combine the constructive interference of all those things together,
00:21:44 it like creates the image,
00:21:47 and at 1030 there's like a good visualization of that.
00:21:50 Is it just because like it's so faint that like a single telescope can't pick it up,
00:21:56 or is it that it's too small?
00:21:58 It's that it's like the angular size of it on the sky is like really tiny.
00:22:06 Yeah.
00:22:07 In terms of like how many like degrees and arc milliseconds and shit.
00:22:12 Gotcha.
00:22:16 Space.
00:22:18 Guys, the limit and space is the place.
00:22:21 Oh, yeah.
00:22:26 This is not exactly related, but I can pretend it is.
00:22:31 I saw that movie yesterday.
00:22:33 Everything everywhere all at once.
00:22:36 Oh, yeah.
00:22:38 I guess it was pretty good.
00:22:40 I liked it.
00:22:41 What is that?
00:22:42 I think I've heard one other person mention the word and I was like,
00:22:46 Haha, you saw everything?
00:22:48 Like what do you mean?
00:22:53 How to explain it without, it's about like,
00:23:01 it's about a woman who starts basically she gets in contact with like other versions
00:23:09 of like herself and like her husband from like other universes where like different.
00:23:15 Oh, so it's like home stuff where different possibilities happened.
00:23:19 It's like, it's like every, every different like way that her life could have gone.
00:23:24 All started like home stuck.
00:23:26 Yes, it's just like home stuck.
00:23:28 All right, I'll go.
00:23:29 Whoa, a picture of a black hole.
00:23:31 It's like home stuck.
00:23:32 Yeah.
00:23:33 A big mirror in space.
00:23:35 It's just like home stuck.
00:23:37 Yeah.
00:23:38 I remember.
00:23:39 Oh yeah, I remember.
00:23:41 It's pretty good.
00:23:42 Little green man turns into a big green man.
00:23:44 I've now seen like home stuck, but no, it's the Hulk.
00:23:47 I've now seen two movies this year, which is a lot for me.
00:23:51 So that's pretty good.
00:23:53 I'm proud of you, Ben.
00:23:54 Thanks.
00:23:55 I'm getting cultured.
00:23:57 I'm getting in.
00:23:58 No, wait, three because I also watched a fucking watch that one liberal movie.
00:24:08 Don't look up.
00:24:09 I watched.
00:24:10 Don't look up.
00:24:11 Don't look up on things.
00:24:14 That one was all right.
00:24:16 I guess.
00:24:17 Yeah, I see.
00:24:18 It's three movies.
00:24:19 That's crazy.
00:24:20 It never happens.
00:24:22 The last movie I saw was episode five of Better Call Saul season six.
00:24:29 I think you're going to say Star Wars.
00:24:32 No.
00:24:33 It's funny.
00:24:36 Like almost all of my best friends have never seen Star Wars.
00:24:40 Like any of them at all.
00:24:42 Yeah, like just most of the people who become my friends are people who just haven't seen
00:24:46 Star Wars.
00:24:47 And it's just a coincidence, I guess.
00:24:49 When I was a kid, it was pretty ubiquitous.
00:24:52 Like I just saw Star Wars because like someone put it on somewhere.
00:24:57 Oh, yeah.
00:24:58 I basically had no choice.
00:24:59 I couldn't avoid it.
00:25:01 Growing up, everyone had seen Star Wars.
00:25:03 It's just all the friends that I have now haven't.
00:25:05 And I don't know how that happened.
00:25:07 That is odd.
00:25:08 Kai hasn't seen it.
00:25:09 Foras hasn't seen it.
00:25:11 Maid hasn't seen it.
00:25:13 I was never a big, huge fan.
00:25:16 I always thought that was fine.
00:25:17 C.T.O.L. had never seen it.
00:25:19 Wow.
00:25:20 Maybe it's creative people.
00:25:22 Maybe creative people don't see Star Wars.
00:25:26 Maybe there's a connection there.
00:25:28 I was cursed.
00:25:29 I was cursed by having seen Star Wars and I can never make anything good.
00:25:33 That explains it.
00:25:34 Yeah.
00:25:35 Oh.
00:25:37 I only make good things because I work so hard despite having seen Star Wars.
00:25:41 You've got to break through the conditioning.
00:25:43 It would be so much easier if only it had never happened but alas.
00:25:48 Oh, I'm looking at Bitcoin.
00:25:51 Oh, no.
00:25:52 It's fallen.
00:25:53 Well, we know that.
00:25:55 Let it fall forever.
00:25:57 It's doing real bad lately and I think that's pretty funny.
00:26:00 Let all those billions disappear.
00:26:02 Yeah.
00:26:03 Let everyone cry.
00:26:06 It's up.
00:26:07 I mean, it's up a bit from like two days ago but like overall it's way down.
00:26:11 So that's great.
00:26:13 I have like, I think I have like maybe $50 worth of Bitcoin in still in my wallet.
00:26:19 So, oops, whatever.
00:26:22 Whoops.
00:26:23 Yeah.
00:26:24 I guess it'll just stay there and dissolve, boil away like alcohol on a Bunsen burner.
00:26:33 Or alcohol.
00:26:34 And bringing it back in my stomach.
00:26:37 I drank some Everclear the other night and boy, was that a mistake.
00:26:42 What's Everclear?
00:26:44 Everclear is like, it's like pure grain alcohol.
00:26:50 Like nothing to it just entirely like ethanol.
00:26:54 You're just downing.
00:26:55 Yes.
00:26:56 Like 190 proof.
00:26:57 I mixed it really, really thin with seltzer water.
00:27:03 And I just tried sipping it and it's still, I had a terrible hangover the next day.
00:27:07 Why would you do this?
00:27:09 I don't know.
00:27:11 I don't know.
00:27:13 I just had some, I had some for cooking reasons, for candy reasons.
00:27:18 And I was like, what if I drank it?
00:27:20 Well, now I know.
00:27:21 I shouldn't have.
00:27:24 It's less than learned.
00:27:26 Less than learned.
00:27:27 All this talk is making me thirsty.
00:27:29 I'm gonna drink some water.
00:27:31 I'm gonna drink some Everclear.
00:27:33 No, Ben, you instantly forgot your lesson.
00:27:37 So tasty.
00:27:39 Gonna get all drunk like the Simsies friends who called in last episode.
00:27:45 I would hate to make a fool of myself like they did.
00:27:48 Making a voicemail for the progress in his podcast.
00:27:52 I mean, could you imagine?
00:27:54 Dude, terrible.
00:27:55 I would never do that.
00:27:57 All right, so I wrote this down.
00:28:00 Yesterday when I listened to that episode, I wanted to be caught up.
00:28:04 Someone mentioned something about Simsies penis being mentioned on the show or something.
00:28:09 I don't remember exactly what the context was, but I fucking swear.
00:28:14 And I have to confirm with someone else unless I'm hallucinating this memory.
00:28:20 Didn't Simsie post his dick on Twitter at some point?
00:28:24 Huh?
00:28:25 I mean, that's in my recollection.
00:28:27 I fucking swear he did.
00:28:29 I fucking swear I've seen Simsies penis on Twitter.
00:28:33 I have such a clear memory of this.
00:28:35 And if I'm wrong, that's really concerning.
00:28:39 I mean, the only funny one of those happenings I can think of is Mike Mate.
00:28:45 But I don't think it was his penis in the end.
00:28:50 I just remember the penis, the head of the dick was as bald as Simsie's head.
00:28:56 That's what I remember.
00:28:57 Well, maybe it was just Simsie's head.
00:29:00 Maybe you saw Simsie and you thought that that was the penis.
00:29:05 I just saw his dick and I'm like, wow, it looks so much like your face.
00:29:09 I don't know what to say.
00:29:11 It feels like a dream.
00:29:12 It feels like this didn't happen.
00:29:14 But I can't, I remember.
00:29:15 Yeah, I'm fine to think that you hallucinated this.
00:29:19 I swear.
00:29:21 Simsie and Simsie's like, yeah, I posted my dick on Twitter.
00:29:24 I want to see it.
00:29:25 I'm like, sure.
00:29:26 And he sent me a Twitter link.
00:29:27 Yeah.
00:29:28 I mean, maybe hallucinated the whole thing.
00:29:30 I guess everyone attacks Simsie.
00:29:32 I mean, I could message him, but no, I can't do that.
00:29:35 Well, now it's live on the podcast.
00:29:38 Now it's libel.
00:29:40 Now it's libel.
00:29:41 Yeah.
00:29:42 Wait, I have an image of Simsie that looks like a penis.
00:29:49 Why?
00:29:50 Because it looked funny and I saved it.
00:29:53 God, where is it?
00:29:54 Okay.
00:29:55 There it is.
00:29:56 I cut out his head.
00:29:58 But yeah, he posted that somewhere and I thought, ha, ha, you know.
00:30:06 At least I put that in the corner and keep it there the whole episode.
00:30:10 It looks like, oh, it looks like that when you fight that boss in Lisa the Painful, the
00:30:15 one that's just a sticky, but he's like a big like phallic, like a like pole, like sticking
00:30:24 out of the ground.
00:30:25 He's just huge.
00:30:26 I do not remember everything from Lisa, but that does sound legally familiar.
00:30:31 In like a dream sequence, you fight basically sticky, sticky, sticky's head.
00:30:36 Not his, not the dad.
00:30:37 You fight like either that one of the dad's friends, the one that he thinks has like kidnapped
00:30:42 and molested Lisa, or not Lisa, a buddy, yeah, his like huge head and it's a big spherical
00:30:51 cylindrical round on the top thing and that's, that's why that's right.
00:30:59 Amazing.
00:31:00 I'm downloading the voicemails, by the way, just so you know, I'm working on it.
00:31:08 Nice.
00:31:09 I've had some bullshit to deal with regarding getting to America.
00:31:15 Yeah.
00:31:18 Getting to America COVID thing.
00:31:21 Yeah.
00:31:22 You still have to have, like I said last time, I didn't know exactly, but it was indeed that
00:31:27 I have to like take a video call with a professional who watches me or directs me to use a specific
00:31:36 test, which I have to buy myself and have it sent to me, which I've done.
00:31:42 I have it.
00:31:43 I have to take the test no more than one day before the flight.
00:31:47 And so I had to, I had to book a consultation with the thing.
00:31:52 And then I, that they're going to call me on my phone or whatever.
00:31:57 I don't know how this is going to work.
00:32:00 I think they have a link that so I can do on my, on my computer and I think I have my
00:32:05 webcam, so it should all be fine.
00:32:07 But I had to pay money to do this test and have the consultation have them say, yes,
00:32:15 you took the test correctly.
00:32:17 Now please give us the results that you find on the test, give us a screenshot.
00:32:22 We'll verify it by comparing the screenshot evidence with the fact that you were with
00:32:29 the consultation and then we'll send you a thing that says you are guaranteed, have
00:32:36 taken a test.
00:32:37 And then I have to bring that along with a verify app thing, like an app thing.
00:32:47 I have to download, I need to download an app and then register so that that is verified
00:32:52 so I can just go up to them and say, okay, here's my passport, here's my ticket, here's
00:32:57 my verify app and also here's my fucking other thing and there we go.
00:33:04 And then they say, get on the ground and kill me anyway.
00:33:08 Get on the ground, because you're British, like, wait a minute, you're British, die.
00:33:14 You don't need any more of your kind, America.
00:33:19 We don't serve your kind, yeah.
00:33:22 Why do they have a British accent when they're doing that?
00:33:24 He's a trader.
00:33:27 No.
00:33:28 We don't serve my kind.
00:33:30 He puts a gun to his head.
00:33:36 That sounds like it sucks.
00:33:38 It was, honestly, as long as the video call isn't annoying, it'll be smooth enough.
00:33:45 But the websites, like the British Airways and the government website for the US and
00:33:54 the government website for the UK where I'm like, what do I need to do?
00:33:57 I Google it, I look like, please tell me what to do and they just don't really tell me.
00:34:03 So I had to go to a random YouTube video where a guy is just saying like a human person in
00:34:09 a way I can understand.
00:34:10 You need to book a thing with a third party company.
00:34:13 Obviously in a government website, for some reason they just can't say that.
00:34:19 They just say you need to have proof of this type of a test, no more than one day before
00:34:24 the flight.
00:34:25 They don't tell you, they don't give you any indication that there's like companies for
00:34:29 that.
00:34:30 I didn't know how to do it until I found a guy and he just said, use this service.
00:34:35 And I did.
00:34:36 And I assume because of how complicated it is, I assume that when I get to the airport,
00:34:42 there's going to be like the vast majority of people getting ready to fly are going to
00:34:48 be like blindsided by this because it's so obtuse, like they're going to be like, what?
00:34:54 What do I need?
00:34:55 I didn't know I needed that.
00:34:56 And then there's going to be like a very, very expensive in airport version of the thing
00:35:01 I did where they're going to be grumbling and being paying like a load of money for
00:35:06 this thing.
00:35:08 And then they take the test and then it gets verified and they're like, fucking stupid,
00:35:11 bullshit, COVID.
00:35:12 I hate everything.
00:35:13 And then they're going to be grumbling through the flight.
00:35:17 I feel like that's definitely going to happen.
00:35:20 So hopefully this is the least trouble version of the things that could have happened.
00:35:27 Oh, yeah, that's that's COVID.
00:35:31 Hopefully hopefully COVID goes away soon.
00:35:35 I yeah, you know, I'm looking at the numbers and they're going up and I don't like it.
00:35:42 I don't like it at all.
00:35:45 That makes me upset, but I don't know what to do about it.
00:35:50 You got to get the mask gun.
00:35:52 You got to shoot masks onto people's faces when they're not wearing them.
00:35:56 Hold on.
00:35:58 Like a slingshot, like a sling, like you swing it around your head and then you throw it
00:36:03 and it's like the force of its spinning motion and it whaps onto their head and it ties itself
00:36:07 around the back of their head.
00:36:09 And then they're like, oh, I can't breathe and they die.
00:36:13 Other cases in the US are going up, not as dramatic.
00:36:17 They're going up more dramatically in Massachusetts specifically.
00:36:23 I think in New York as well.
00:36:25 That's bad.
00:36:27 Pretty bad.
00:36:28 I mean, is the vaccination rate high?
00:36:31 Yeah.
00:36:32 So it's just just one of those things.
00:36:35 Just one of those things.
00:36:37 Yeah.
00:36:38 The vaccination rate is quite high in Massachusetts.
00:36:43 Well, if the worst-case scenario happens, I mean, the worst-case scenario is I get COVID
00:36:51 before I fly and I can't even see anyone.
00:36:54 But other than that, if I land and then I catch COVID, at least I won't die.
00:37:00 I'm pretty happy to know that I'm just going to have a bit of a sniffle for a while and
00:37:06 that's about it.
00:37:08 Most likely.
00:37:09 I mean, you'll feel bad.
00:37:10 Yeah, it's going to hurt.
00:37:12 It's not unlike a fever, it's not unlike a terrible annoyance, and I'm going to feel
00:37:18 like shit.
00:37:20 But the threat of death being mostly gone, very, very much gone from catching COVID, is
00:37:30 alleviated a lot of fears I would have had.
00:37:32 If I catch it, eh, I'll just try to keep to myself.
00:37:36 And make sure no one else does.
00:37:39 My parents got the second booster.
00:37:41 I want the second booster, but I guess they're not, it's not available to just anyone yet.
00:37:47 So.
00:37:48 Ah.
00:37:49 Oh well.
00:37:50 What can I do?
00:37:51 You just got to boost jump into the hospital and steal it.
00:37:57 Oh.
00:37:58 Okay.
00:37:59 You got to clip through the wall.
00:38:02 I guess I will, then.
00:38:08 Thanks.
00:38:09 No problem.
00:38:10 It's my advice show.
00:38:14 Yeah.
00:38:15 Fucking.
00:38:16 On the topic of that, since I caught it the last time, my voice, I realized yesterday
00:38:22 that my voice is a little bit fucked.
00:38:25 You think?
00:38:26 I can't do high-pitched sounds anymore.
00:38:30 I noticed that when I was sick, I couldn't do the VemSnakes voice while I was on the
00:38:34 PCP for that big reveal episode.
00:38:38 I couldn't do the voice.
00:38:40 And I can do it again, but anything higher than VemSnakes, I can't do anymore.
00:38:44 And it sucks.
00:38:47 I notice sometimes I find myself not able to do a high-pitched noise that I feel like
00:38:53 I used to be able to do.
00:38:54 But I'll try it right now.
00:38:57 I'm doing it.
00:38:58 And now I can do it pretty fine.
00:39:01 That's pretty good.
00:39:02 Oh, that's completely not getting picked up by your mic.
00:39:05 You can't hear.
00:39:06 Oh, I heard the beginning of it.
00:39:10 That's the best I could do.
00:39:11 Oh, that's the best I could do.
00:39:12 And you drowned out.
00:39:13 It must be the noise.
00:39:14 It's probably getting picked up by the microphone.
00:39:16 It's just discord noise filter.
00:39:18 Maybe.
00:39:19 Funny.
00:39:20 This cord is pretty high.
00:39:23 It's discriminatory against people with squeaky voice.
00:39:27 Yes, die.
00:39:30 People discriminatory against TH versus F sounds, apparently, too.
00:39:35 Oh, yeah.
00:39:38 That one was Smailer who called me cute.
00:39:40 How dare they do that?
00:39:42 Did they call you cute at the same time?
00:39:46 This is making fun of your dialect.
00:39:49 My dialect?
00:39:50 I don't know.
00:39:51 It's not because of where I'm from, because people in New Zealand, once or twice, I had
00:39:55 a friend who would make fun of me.
00:39:56 They'd be like, oh, say thick, and I'm like, thick, and I'd say some word of letter F and
00:40:04 I'd say it.
00:40:05 And they'd be like, haha, what the fuck?
00:40:06 You say it wrong.
00:40:07 And I'm like, OK, how do you say it?
00:40:08 And then they make the same sound twice.
00:40:11 And I don't get it.
00:40:13 I know there's a difference between TH and F.
00:40:17 That's like when you sound the same when people try to correct me.
00:40:22 When someone tries to explain how to correctly pronounce Chinese and I literally can't hear
00:40:28 the difference between the two things, because Chinese just has sounds in it that I just
00:40:34 don't recognize as phonemes that a person can make when speaking.
00:40:40 I always felt like the TH is F thing was like a British thing.
00:40:45 If I say 43 instead of 43, I'd say 43.
00:40:52 I guess I do the E thing as well.
00:40:54 I'd leave out the T. 43 quid.
00:40:58 43 quid.
00:41:01 As I understand it, the difference, TH just has slightly more emphasis.
00:41:07 When I pronounce the sound, I kind of push my teeth a little closer together, maybe.
00:41:12 But the end result kind of sounds the same.
00:41:14 I just, TH is more slurred for me, at least.
00:41:17 Thrush.
00:41:18 I feel like it's interchangeable depending on, yeah, I feel like it's interchangeable
00:41:24 depending on how much emphasis I want to use.
00:41:27 If I'm calling someone fat, I'm going to really draw out that F sound and then maybe it sounds
00:41:33 more like a TH, I don't know.
00:41:36 Say thick fighters.
00:41:40 Thick fighters, thick fighters, thick fighters.
00:41:46 I have to deliberately press my teeth together if I'm trying to announce it correctly, but
00:41:50 if I'm just talking normally, I don't give a fuck.
00:41:52 I don't give a fuck.
00:41:54 I don't give a fuck.
00:41:56 I don't give a fuck about fat.
00:42:00 Yeah, now you're using the PH levels are high.
00:42:09 The PH levels are high, that reminds me of gummy worms and about pectin.
00:42:16 And everything I learned about pectin.
00:42:18 Did I talk last week about that?
00:42:20 You talked about gummies, I don't remember exactly.
00:42:21 You talked about gummies last week.
00:42:23 You talked about...
00:42:24 Did I talk about that YouTube channel, The Modernist Pantry?
00:42:27 No, I don't think so.
00:42:30 Well, I found a YouTube channel that is about...
00:42:35 There's a brand of ingredients you can buy on Amazon.
00:42:37 I see them all the time.
00:42:38 They're kind of expensive, but they're also the only people that sell certain things.
00:42:43 They're called The Modernist Pantry, and they have a YouTube channel that I found a video
00:42:48 on there that's like everything to do with gummies, and they talk about gelatin, they
00:42:54 talk about pectin.
00:42:55 They have other videos that are like specifically going into the details of different kinds
00:42:59 of pectin, and why some need sugar and acid, and others need calcium, and stuff like that.
00:43:06 And it's like this is exactly what I wanted to know.
00:43:11 And these videos are like new.
00:43:13 They were made like a couple months ago.
00:43:14 This information didn't exist online like two years ago when I was like first starting
00:43:20 my gummy journey.
00:43:22 Anyway, I have...
00:43:27 I keep...
00:43:28 Man, I tried to duplicate a recipe.
00:43:31 I made a batch a while ago, and I was like, that recipe came out good.
00:43:34 I'm going to make it again.
00:43:36 And I was like, okay, I'm going to do that exact same thing.
00:43:38 And I made that exact same recipe, and it came out different.
00:43:42 With different consistency.
00:43:44 And I'm so confused sometimes.
00:43:47 Sometimes I just don't know what's going on.
00:43:50 There's so many variables.
00:43:52 You've got to perfectly make the exact same things, the exact...
00:44:00 You've got to have like the room temperature the same.
00:44:02 So many variables, including like how long do I cook it for?
00:44:06 How hot do I let it get?
00:44:07 Like how much do I stir it and stuff?
00:44:09 It's like that.
00:44:10 Those are things that affect.
00:44:11 How toxic is your mind in that day?
00:44:14 How many VTubers have you yelled out to expel the toxins?
00:44:18 It was full of toxicity.
00:44:20 It seeped into my into the finished product.
00:44:25 By the way, I thought of a fun tongue twister.
00:44:28 Okay.
00:44:29 Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.
00:44:30 Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.
00:44:32 Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.
00:44:33 Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.
00:44:36 Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.
00:44:37 Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.
00:44:41 I like it. I like it. There's a little new endless war. Yeah. Oops, we made another one.
00:44:58 It's a big boo-boo-boo Maui milkers. It's the branch that is obsessed with like fies
00:45:04 and just for technique. Sex. One is obsessed with fighting with their thighs and the other
00:45:11 one just fucks a lot. Yeah, they're both pure evil. Chaotic evil, sex. In the alignment
00:45:24 chart of like things. Sex is chaotic evil and then education is lawful evil. The opposite
00:45:37 of sex is education. Yeah, okay. What else could go on there? True neutral zoning out
00:45:45 getting high. Why not? I'm never educated. I don't want to be having sex. No. I should
00:46:00 I should I should have stayed in academia. I should have stayed a physics guy. I would
00:46:06 know things now. Now I don't know anything. Now I'm useless. Maybe I could have been on
00:46:15 that space telescope. Maybe I could have been launched into space. Wouldn't that and wouldn't
00:46:20 that be something? I don't know. I don't know. I feel like they say what's the cost-benefit
00:46:26 analysis of throwing Ben St. into space. I could have I could have made that so much
00:46:30 fuel. So much fuel I did. Yeah, I'll waste some fuel. Yeah, I'll waste some fuel for
00:46:38 NASA. What of it? It seems he's in chat right now and blue and four is hounding them. Yeah,
00:46:53 we got we got to know about that. I am on the side of it was a dream. It was a hallucination.
00:46:58 I think it was I think it was wishful thinking. I think it's gaslighting. You're trying to
00:47:06 convince Simzi that he already posted his dick. So he'll say, Oh, well, might as well
00:47:09 post it again. I guess. It's just for temper. It was another one of my friends. I don't
00:47:16 know. Simzi just looks the most like a dick and looks the most like a penis. That's a
00:47:26 compliment. I suppose. Do you think Simzi is a thick fighter or a thorough fucker? Oh,
00:47:38 geez. He's pretty large. So maybe he's a thick fighter. I don't know. And I've never seen him
00:47:45 fuck. So do I know that he'd be thorough? I can only I can only guess.
00:47:51 There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
00:47:55 That's right.
00:47:58 Hmm. Hey, what else do I do this week? Nothing.
00:48:05 You guys seen that creator clash thing? Oh, I only just heard about it.
00:48:12 But I heard about it yesterday and I saw a video of was it the guy from like epic mealtime punching
00:48:19 ego raptor? Yeah, from Game Grumps, as well as a bunch of other YouTubers who are mostly
00:48:28 I don't care about them. But I dobs organized a fighting match because he wanted to fight
00:48:35 rice gum and rice gum chickened out because of course he would. I don't know who rice
00:48:40 gum is. I've rice gum. Thank God, you don't know. He did a content cop on him. I dobs did.
00:48:46 Okay, he's an annoying guy, but sure. He wanted to make it like an actual event with like boxing
00:48:53 coaches and to train for like months. And when rice gum didn't do it, he was like, OK,
00:49:01 well, I'm looking for other YouTube creators, other people. And then he just organized a
00:49:06 big old thing. And before you know it, there's a bunch of YouTubers gonna fight each other
00:49:12 to the death. And it was funny to see killed live on stream. It was funny to see ego raptor
00:49:19 getting punched. But the more I thought about it, the less surprising it was. I was like,
00:49:26 yeah, this is something he'd do. It does make this makes this makes a lot of sense for everyone
00:49:31 involved, actually. YouTubers boxing has become a thing. So I guess this was inevitable. Yeah,
00:49:39 although I dubs. I dubs really tried hard. I he made a video and I watched that I watched him
00:49:46 where he talks about like the pros and cons of like influencer boxing matches. And like how
00:49:52 things like Jake Paul, like he likes the mystery is the thing you said he likes the mystery of if
00:50:00 you go to see a boxing match, you know that the boxer is a boxer and they're gonna go be good
00:50:05 at boxing is just whether they're gonna win or not. Yeah, Jake Paul is an influencer boxer,
00:50:10 but he's done more than one boxing match. So the mystery is gone. You know that he can box
00:50:16 because he's already done it. And it's like less interesting. So the whole thing with this is
00:50:21 like, all of these weirdos, you have no idea if they even know what if they even know what
00:50:26 they're doing. Yeah. Yeah. And I dubs was I watched I dubs this match. And he was actually very
00:50:32 good. He trained very hard. It was impressive. It was a crazy event. I just, what do you know, huh?
00:50:42 My first reaction is to go and roll my eyes. But like, I guess there's no nothing wrong with it.
00:50:49 Like, why not? Why not box each other? It's fine. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:50:59 I didn't watch many of the other matches because I didn't know most of the other people.
00:51:03 I think I recognize Keith Apecari as like dad, who is like a character, you know,
00:51:10 Keith Apecari, the the balding like nerd looking guy. No, he does like, he does like a character
00:51:17 where he's like, oh, I'm a nerd and I will and he does like crazy pretfalls. He was on an angry
00:51:25 video game nerd episode where they were smashing through walls and stuff. And he's done some other
00:51:30 things. He's like a nutcase, I feel like, not like a real nutcase, but he could, he could, I feel like
00:51:39 he's dangerous. He's a dangerous guy. He's dangerous. Oh God. He's got he's got a dangerous,
00:51:44 he's got a dangerous aura to him. I want to watch that fight next. It's all finished though.
00:51:50 Yeah. Well, I probably won't watch any. I think that one clip of ego raptor getting punched
00:52:02 was plenty. Yeah, I doubt it's going to get any better than that. I only saw a clip of
00:52:07 iDubbbz with blood running down his face. iDubbbz took it so seriously. It was cool. It was actually
00:52:14 cool. Yeah, I maybe I'll look into it. I when I I enjoyed iDubbbz for a time back in 2016 2017,
00:52:23 but the more like removed we are from that era of YouTube, the more I don't want to look back on it.
00:52:30 I have I have never watched any iDubbbz. I mean, I know who he is more or less.
00:52:37 It was just a very sour time for YouTube.
00:52:41 If I had to like pick a word. Why? Because it was a lot of like
00:52:45 bickering and infighting and yeah, calling each other. I don't know what they called each other
00:52:51 back then cringe. So we still do that. Yeah.
00:52:58 I don't know. They were the kind of creators who were like prominent back then or just
00:53:03 I don't know just kind of unpleasant was is the general vibe, I feel. I mean, I feel like
00:53:08 most people are still around. I feel like iDubbbz is he's not. He's kind of like a like a, I don't
00:53:16 know, chaotic good. I'd fucking alignment shit. Like he's a good guy. And he has done edgy stuff
00:53:25 before. But like, I like him. I think he does. I mean, this event was like all of the proceeds
00:53:31 went to charity, which is a nice thing. And like everybody involved was like volunteered to be part
00:53:38 of it. And they enjoyed the he got like coaches for everyone. He seemed like a really like a serious
00:53:44 like mature like event thing, rather than just like, dude, let's get so fucking cranked up and punch
00:53:51 each other. And it's like a big YouTuber thing. Like it didn't feel like that. Yeah. I mean,
00:53:57 you kind of have to take it seriously. If you're like, planning it, even if even if the idea is
00:54:03 stupid, it's like, well, yeah, sure. But we got to like, if we actually want to make it happen,
00:54:09 we have to treat the concept with seriousness. So I guess, I guess it just
00:54:16 it makes sense that he was the one to organize it if he was the one taking it the most seriously.
00:54:21 Yeah. Yeah. His opponent was like a is like a doctor who boxes and has boxed for 10 years.
00:54:29 And he's like, like a very, very good boxer. So it was not like, I feel like if the rice
00:54:38 gun thing had happened, he would have killed him. Like rice is nothing. And he's like a real
00:54:46 he's a real Weasley type. And he probably wouldn't put any effort into actually training. So if he
00:54:52 did actually, he would have been like, he just knocked him out instantly. I feel like this was
00:54:57 going he went up against someone who was definitely better than him. And he held his own. It was great.
00:55:03 I wish I wish someone I wish someone would beat the shit out of Mr. Girl. That would be really
00:55:09 funny. But I'm also glad that Mr. Girl is too small time to go to something like this. So actually,
00:55:14 that would be bad if that happens. Who the fuck? Who the hell? You know what? Don't worry about it.
00:55:20 You know what? I'm glad you don't know. I'm glad you don't know.
00:55:25 Some fucking some some some some transphobe psychopath who are the dick show people really
00:55:30 like. Well, anyway, what do you think about the PCP boxing match? You want to fight Ben? You want
00:55:36 to fight when I throw down? Yes. Yes. I'll kill you. We'll do the same thing, but we'll use weapons
00:55:45 like in Dark Souls. It'll be an Elden Ring like in the ring. Cyber Shell tweeted he had a genius
00:55:53 idea. Elden Octagon. A creator clash but with guns. Yes, I saw that. That's why I thought like we get
00:56:00 Cyber Shell there. We got all the PCP guests and we'll kill each other. I think I think I think
00:56:09 Simsie might be the biggest guest we've had. He's very tall. I've heard. I don't know if it's
00:56:15 Cyber Shell tall. I have no idea. Cyber Shell is a sonic character. So quite short, I think.
00:56:22 How tall is Simsie again? Like eight foot, like nine, ten. I think he's he's got to be like six.
00:56:29 I think he's I mean, he's over six feet. I think he's like maybe like six six or something. I don't
00:56:34 know. I just six. I feel like I've heard that he's very tall. I don't actually know how tall.
00:56:38 I mean, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he was like six around six two or six three.
00:56:44 Yeah, maybe. I'm six one and a half ish. I don't consider myself that tall. But when I go out in
00:56:51 public, everyone's shorter than me and it's just weird. Why do I have to be tall? I mean,
00:56:57 I'm taller than all the women. That sucks. Does it get fucked a little bit?
00:57:03 Hmm. Actually, I'm sorry. Actually, there's a voice actress I'm in contact with who might
00:57:11 be voicing my character and some things and she's six four. So that's pretty cool.
00:57:17 I think you mentioned her. You you mentioned some voice actress for Falia at some point.
00:57:26 Maybe it's the same person. Might be. I mean, this is someone I met more recently.
00:57:30 I had. Wait, hang on. Hold that thought. Falia. Phallic.
00:57:38 Yes, that's how I only just got that. That's how I thought of the name. Wow.
00:57:45 Oh, I can eat it. I need a name. What phallic phallia? Oh, that works. It's
00:57:49 perfect. Five seconds. Oh, God. I just sorry. I just looked at
00:58:00 no, I just looked at the Twitter trending tab and I would know what are you seeing, Ben? What are
00:58:06 you? The buffalo shooting, grooming, replacement theory, white supremacy, Ukraine. Okay, Ukraine
00:58:17 drives back Russian forces. I guess that's not so bad. That's not so bad. That one's all right,
00:58:22 I guess. My Twitter feed is Japanese, so I don't have to worry about anything.
00:58:30 I was I never have a Twitter feed. They'll like if you if you want to go and eat the
00:58:34 slop in the trough, then have a feed, but you don't do want that. No, you don't need it.
00:58:40 You don't need that slop, Ben. I was just clicking through. I was just idly clicking
00:58:45 around artists just now, actually, just in case I found anyone who draws how I want.
00:58:52 And all the ones, they're all Japanese. I can't ask them. They don't speak English.
00:58:57 Some of them might, I guess. Did you really ask her? I don't know how to pronounce her
00:59:03 fucking name. Did you really just say I have a business inquiry and leave it at that?
00:59:08 Well, I said I said send me a DM because I couldn't send them one because their DMs were closed and
00:59:14 you should have waived the budget in front of them. So they're like money, maybe.
00:59:19 Really? You think I should? I mean, I guess I could do. I mean, I don't know. Like,
00:59:23 if I got a tweet saying I have a business inquiry, I'm just going to read that and be like,
00:59:27 you would the fuck? Okay. That's vague and ominous.
00:59:33 Didn't mean to be vague and ominous. I don't know. I just didn't think I should give all the details
00:59:38 right out in public. But yeah, I mean, true. If you mentioned like, I have this much money to
00:59:43 throw around, people might be like, um, um, what about me? Hot? Yeah. That all come busting in.
00:59:51 And I mean, would that be such a bad thing? Some of them might be good. It could happen.
00:59:58 Maybe, maybe. Yeah. Sure.
01:00:02 Uh, yeah, I guess it's worth another try because I didn't get, I didn't get an answer.
01:00:08 Um, yeah. And then you'll be known forever as Ben St. V. Annoying Pestering Man.
01:00:17 Yep. Well, I already am. Can't, can't be worse than what I've, I'm already known for on Twitter,
01:00:23 so only you can only, things can only improve. Okay. Okay. Well, I didn't do anything else this week.
01:00:33 I was going to go to Trader Joe's today, but I don't think I'm going. I don't need anything.
01:00:38 I have been animating a fat fucking pussy, um, this week, and I'm doing it right now
01:00:47 as I am in this podcast, moving lines back and forth.
01:00:52 How could you? I studied the blade. I know how to make a pussy look really fat.
01:00:59 I see. I see. Yeah, because the pen is mightier than the sword, so you studied the blade,
01:01:05 and you threw it out, and then I studied the pen. It was better.
01:01:09 Yeah, basically. Um, I guess I have some, some news that's good. Uh, Kai's top surgery is funded.
01:01:19 Based. Oh, good. Thanks to the, I think I mentioned last time I was on that we would be
01:01:24 able to afford it, and yeah, we did. We have a date scheduled for the surgery. Uh, six, nine,
01:01:30 Lamau. Lamau. Pretty good. Hmm. Um, what's the, what's the Japanese way to say congratulations?
01:01:43 Congratulations. Oh, yeah. Yeah, like an Ava. Hmm. That wasn't a dub. That's just how it was.
01:01:52 It's not itadakimasu. It's not gomennasai. It's ohayou gozaimasu. It's uh, sure. Probably.
01:02:01 It's a fukka. It's kawaii. Yes, yes. All these are ringing a lot of bells in my mind. Uh, got it.
01:02:12 Um, yeah, yeah. Well, that's pretty sick. Uh, good, good luck. It's probably gonna,
01:02:19 it's probably gonna hurt. It's probably gonna hurt a lot. That sucks. But uh, it'll be good,
01:02:26 I suppose. Uh, it'll be good. Pretty excited about that. Yeah. I'm excited. You go to the
01:02:32 top surgery and you have samurais there. He does like the iaii. Slice some right off. Hmm. Honestly.
01:02:41 I know, I know a lot of, I have a lot of people who are like donate the boobs to me and I'm like,
01:02:45 yeah, if only it worked that way. If only. Okay, so you're saying is it, it doesn't work that way?
01:02:52 No, it doesn't. Um, not legally. But if you want it to be criminal, have like illegal tits.
01:03:02 I mean, okay, I'm, I'm assume, if you can't do that, then I'm assuming it wouldn't work.
01:03:08 Because otherwise I feel like people genuinely would do that.
01:03:13 I guarantee it's possible to have a hormone that would just make boob go into overdrive.
01:03:22 Because I've seen it happen. Wow. I've seen it happen. There's a. You've seen it? What,
01:03:28 what have you seen happen? There's a woman who I found her through Twitter. Um, she goes by
01:03:36 Vatheverbeck. She has unbelievable gigantic natural boobage. Um, that just came out of nowhere,
01:03:46 like in her firties. Um, after she had. Vatheverbeck. Yeah, Vatheverbeck. She is a very well-chested
01:03:55 woman. Well-chested? Yes. Oh, I might have seen her. I mean, there's a, I mean, I know there's
01:04:04 a condition called Gigantomastia that makes that happen. Like usually, though, like most stories
01:04:12 I hear about with Vatheverbeck, like when it happens in, um, like, you know, I guess something
01:04:18 just went wrong during puberty or whatever, like they just kept growing and kept growing and kept
01:04:22 growing, so to deal. But like, she had like, like medium titties her whole life. And then
01:04:28 after miscarriage, they just went boom, uh, over. After a miscarriage. Yeah. So I guess something
01:04:37 hormonal must have gotten fucked up and triggered it. Um, so I don't know. It's, it's probably
01:04:44 possible to figure out if, if, if, if it weren't for ethics, uh, that could be figured out for
01:04:53 people. But I don't know, unlikely to happen. It's, yeah. I mean, it's, there's not a lot of
01:05:01 science annoyingly. There's not a lot of science on like that specifically. I've, I've seen the papers.
01:05:07 I've seen many papers because, you know, obviously I'm trying to grow my own. And a lot of it just
01:05:16 doesn't seem like there's enough evidence for, to say too much one way or the other.
01:05:24 It's just sort of like, yeah, some people just, it just happens. And then not a lot,
01:05:28 not a lot of people are really understand it. And the impetus, the, the, the, the, the, what would
01:05:34 you call it? The motivation? What do you call it when it's the, there's a thing to do something?
01:05:39 Is impetus the right word? Maybe. The impetus to like research it and figure it out. Isn't there?
01:05:45 Because it is cosmetic. It's not like medicinal. You don't need to have huge tits. Oh, well,
01:05:53 that's what they'd like you to think. I, I just, if it were, if it were possible to do,
01:06:01 to, to donate the breast tissue to someone else, I don't see why people wouldn't do it.
01:06:08 I mean, I know that it wouldn't, I know that just wouldn't fucking work because it would get rejected
01:06:12 and the body would just. I mean, science could improve, but right now it's not a thing, I don't
01:06:18 think. But, but I mean, they do that with other body parts. They just put it in and it doesn't,
01:06:25 you guess, they do. I mean, I mean, it's just like fat mostly, right? I guess so.
01:06:34 It's the memory glands, I think, is the, the strange part. Like, they need to connect to
01:06:39 something. And I don't know if the technology exists because there's no like, like, why would you
01:06:46 put money into like researching that? There's no technology doesn't exist to like connect
01:06:52 the memory glands of a foreign body onto your own such that they'll like, like the body will
01:06:59 accept it. It could be doable. I just, I don't think anyone would, which is annoying.
01:07:06 But you have memory glands already, so you just have like an extra pair of memory glands on top
01:07:14 of the old memory glands and that would just be. Well, that's the thing. Maybe you'd have to like
01:07:19 scoop out the ones that already exist. It's like weird. Put the bigger ones in.
01:07:25 I mean, they figured the shit out for cows to make them mega. Yeah, it's a lot less scary
01:07:32 and more epic to just take a bunch of funny pills and they'll explode
01:07:38 all on their own. Do they, do they, do they transplant utter material onto cows? No, no,
01:07:46 no with cows, it's just hormones. Oh, yeah. They found the mega milk hormones.
01:07:52 Yeah, but the, I mean, that's, I mean, milk, milk production and, and like
01:07:59 utter size or not. It's the same. I don't know.
01:08:03 Seem there some are related. Probably.
01:08:08 Well, I've learned that we don't know anything. We don't know enough.
01:08:13 Really, they're just, we just need to take all the money, all the money and put it into research
01:08:21 so that we can finally figure this out so that future generations can just say
01:08:26 huge tits please and they can have them. We don't have to worry about like it being impossible.
01:08:32 We need that money for, for border security. No, open them borders and give me some big fat
01:08:40 old titties please. It'll never, it might pass in the house, but it'll never pass the
01:08:46 Senate, the resolution. I'm sorry. The dream dies here. I'll run for prime minister and that'll
01:08:53 be my thing. Tits, that's what I'll say. I'll say tits, I'll say breasts. Tits or GTFO is
01:09:00 your fucking running slogan. The big booby mommy milker party. I mean, why not?
01:09:09 These days, they'll let anyone run. Yes, they will. That's what's called living in
01:09:20 some sort of a system. I know, I can hate it. It's nonsense.
01:09:29 Well, I mean, what do you think about voicemails around this time?
01:09:32 Well, are we too early for those? I have another little thing to say. Oh, sure. Yeah.
01:09:41 So I booted up Shia from, this is an MMO from years ago. Really bad. Shia. S-H-I, S-H-A-I-Y-A.
01:09:57 I've never heard of it. You wouldn't know. It's very obscure, but it was the sort of thing I saw
01:10:05 in the sidebar and it's like, MMO, but for free? You don't have to pay for World of Warcraft
01:10:10 subscription. You could just play this one. I'm like, oh my god, for free? I don't have a credit
01:10:15 card yet. So I played it. This looks like one of those things that you'd see with like, it's like,
01:10:21 if you are over 40 and have a computer, you must play this game.
01:10:27 I don't know what that means. That's an ad I see all the time. And there's a picture of a tree.
01:10:33 It's a picture. What are you looking at? I don't know. I've just seen an ad that says that.
01:10:40 Just on sites that have ads. Oh, yeah. It does look like one of those. I saw
01:10:48 a video of someone who played one of those like, you'll come in two seconds like games.
01:10:54 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, the sexy. It turned out it was just like,
01:10:58 it was like a whole just MMO that was just really shitty.
01:11:02 You see the thing? They'd come in two seconds. Yes. I mean, I came, but I didn't come every two
01:11:08 seconds. No, this, I remember that they had the advertising of like, there's the good elf goddess
01:11:16 who's sexy and the evil elf goddess who's also sexy and choose which one you follow.
01:11:22 So difficult. That did entice me when I was 13 or however old I was,
01:11:27 but I actually do remember playing the game a lot and the game was bad and it sucked,
01:11:33 but it was fine and it was good, but it was really bad and worse than World of Warcraft,
01:11:37 but I love it. And so I downloaded it the other day just to, you know,
01:11:42 fill time because I'm a loser. I don't do anything. And I realized that I really miss,
01:11:52 I made a tweet about this, I really miss polygonal, bad graphics with no dynamic lighting and
01:12:00 shadows and like shitty animations and terrible everything, but it's just got the right aesthetic.
01:12:10 I like it. I like being in like completely obviously fake locations that are charmingly
01:12:17 outdated with really blurry bad textures that are like
01:12:24 competent at like presenting a video game experience where you just walk around and you
01:12:30 kill things and you grab loot and yeah, it was good. I love, I love old stuff. I like old good,
01:12:38 new bad and I just really, I really just, I pine for a game that embraces like shit art direction,
01:12:48 well not art direction, but shit art like capabilities, technological capabilities
01:12:55 because it does have art direction. It's actually quite nice, some of the places,
01:13:00 but they just like, you can look into the distance and it's got like fog and you can see
01:13:05 things popping in, but like the hills have like three polygons. It's not smooth at all
01:13:13 and you walk up it like there's no change in your animation, like your feet don't change.
01:13:21 It's very static and there's like shitty particle effects.
01:13:26 No reverse kinematics on the character model's legs?
01:13:29 None, not even one reverse kinematic and it's just like, oh my god, I love that for them.
01:13:38 I see. And I don't know, I was just, I was pining for the fjords, those specific fjords.
01:13:46 I just, I like it and I don't like how every single game ever since like the invention of
01:13:56 fast and easy, no brain cells necessary lighting engine where like shadows and bloom and directional
01:14:08 light and stuff is like commonplace to the point of everything looking exactly the same
01:14:13 and it's soft and it's all the edges are anti-aliased and you can, and it's all like,
01:14:19 like made a play-doh and like it's a Pixar movie, every Pixar movie is exactly the same movie with
01:14:24 exactly the same character designs, exactly the same face and it's all exactly the same.
01:14:30 Where's my edge, where's my alias fucking cube with a shitty texture wrapped around it?
01:14:37 There's, they don't exist anymore. I have to go back. If I want something that looks like shit,
01:14:44 I can't find it anymore. It's not up, it's just unacceptable.
01:14:50 That's my, that's my video game brand.
01:14:52 Their art style for some of their recent movies and people Pixar, Pixar did have like a same
01:15:01 face sort of like approach for a while. Pixar has gotten better about it, but it's just sort of like,
01:15:08 like for a long time the Incredibles was like the only movie where like the humans like
01:15:13 like had like interesting designs and they like only started recently changing that up again.
01:15:18 Um, everyone complained, everyone complained, ew, Cal Arts and that.
01:15:26 Look at this fucking, hang on, sorry.
01:15:28 Oh my god, that boy's so sharp. He looks like he's friends with Genesis Valentine.
01:15:33 Look at this fucking font. The guard isn't even capitalized. It's so good. I love this font.
01:15:39 I mean,
01:15:45 I've had it with these fucking anti-aliasing overlords and their their claw grip on the
01:15:51 video game industry. They've got, they've got away, they've gotten away with too much.
01:15:56 It's, uh, it's very, uh, it's very angular. Important is what it is. It's very crisp.
01:16:02 It's, uh, it's, I mean, it makes me feel, it makes me feel like I'm playing with toys. It's
01:16:13 like it's just a cool epic action figure. Nowadays, I feel like I'm, I don't know, playing with a
01:16:21 shit action figure that's not a toy that's too real. I see, I see like a,
01:16:27 uh, a thing and I don't like it.
01:16:35 Oh, you know what it is? I also see a thing and don't like it.
01:16:38 You know when, like, I maybe don't, but like, there's, uh, I got, sometimes I go on my mobile
01:16:44 phone. I'm like, I want to have a game on here that I want to play. I feel like that's not too
01:16:50 much to ask. So I go on there and I look for something that's like, uh, medieval castle maybe,
01:16:56 some sort of a medieval castle game. I don't know, a tower defense. Maybe it's clash of
01:17:00 clowns even good. I look at it. I look at these sorts of things. They're like, I'll try one.
01:17:07 They're not that good and they're obviously very predatory with their microtransaction stuff,
01:17:12 but aside from all that, the graphics are way too cutesy. They're not edgy. They're not hard.
01:17:18 They don't look like castles. They look like, like duplo for plasticine babies. They're made of,
01:17:25 they're made of breast milk. They're nothing. They're like, if you pick up a little one of
01:17:33 these castles, if they're like a real thing, if they, you 3D print the video game art assets and
01:17:38 you have them, you wouldn't be able to choke on them. They'd be baby safe. They'd be, you wouldn't
01:17:43 be able to cut yourself with them. Where's the toys that if I grab them, it'd hurt and it cut me
01:17:48 and it'll draw blood. That's what I want. I want things that would hurt. I want to feel pain.
01:17:54 I want to feel anything. I don't know how to explain this feeling. I hope somebody in the
01:18:00 audience understands. I know what you mean. I want, I want literal edges on everything that I can slice
01:18:08 myself with. Edgy? Question mark? Edgehog? True. Need more edged weapons. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
01:18:21 It's a strange, it just overwhelmed me as I was playing it. I was like, oh my god,
01:18:27 I love this, but it's objectively unappealing in a lot of ways. Why do I want this? I don't know
01:18:35 why really. My rant is half observed and half off the cuff rambling nonsense, but I just,
01:18:46 yeah, you ever feel that? You ever get a big nostalgia hit and you're like, the good old days,
01:18:51 you just like scream it from the rooftops. You don't even know what you're doing.
01:18:55 You're just like, oh, the good old days. Stamp your fist. Sure. All the time. Ben,
01:19:04 you seem unconvinced. I'm convinced. I feel what you're saying a lot.
01:19:17 For me, okay, so like Age of Empires got this crazy flashy remake. They remade
01:19:24 all the first free games, I think, for Age of Empires.
01:19:28 Like the definitive edition or like a different version? I think it was definitive, wasn't it?
01:19:32 Actually, maybe it's definitive edition. It was like a year or two ago. Oh, 2018. Okay,
01:19:38 I guess more than a couple of years ago. But yeah, like they basically rebuilt the games
01:19:43 from the ground up and they work exactly the same, but the graphics are all shiny and whatever.
01:19:47 And like, I don't mind the graphical changes. I miss like the more pixely graphics of Age of
01:19:53 Empires one. But the thing that upsets me is that they changed for voices. They changed for
01:19:57 voices. They re-recorded them and they sound stupid now. And by stupid, I mean, they don't
01:20:03 sound stupid anymore. In the original Age of Empires one, if you click on a guy and tell
01:20:08 him to walk around, there's this funny fucking voice, but it's like, Rogan, Diploma, Sunks,
01:20:15 Irvine. Yeah, that's exactly it. He says some stupid shit and I love it. But in the new one,
01:20:22 they have like, it sounds like they grab like some guy out of like a magazine for like a hotel
01:20:28 resort. You know, you know, you see like the pictures of the guy like smiling by the pool,
01:20:32 looking at you. And you don't know what ethnicity he is because his skin's like
01:20:38 some weird like middle shade and he's Greek. Is he from Europe? Is he brown? I don't know what's
01:20:44 going on. It just sounds like, like, I don't know. The voices just sound like really friendly. Like,
01:20:51 it's like some infomercial for clean drinking water in Africa. Like, I don't know. It's,
01:20:56 they ruined it. Get these friendly voices away. Bring me back my Rogan. I need that.
01:21:02 Guy. I miss him. You remember the Joe Rogan experience? Rogan? Rogan?
01:21:13 They're asking where the new episode is. I remember chopper. That was my favorite one
01:21:20 from Average Urban Empires 2. When you click on a female villager and you send her to go chop wood,
01:21:26 so she'll say chopper if she's like British. She'll say other things if she's like
01:21:31 Spanish. They think they have like vaguely like true to some of the country's like language,
01:21:40 but not real language. It feels like Simlish almost. But like the Britons, you can always
01:21:46 understand vaguely what they're saying. Oh my god, I found it. Harbour Darkers. I remember
01:21:52 Habitacus. It's my favorite one. You're talking about, you're talking about Age of Empires, right?
01:21:58 You're talking about Age of Empires. I found the Voicelands. I just love this. I just miss this.
01:22:04 It's cool. It's janky. Duprema? Duprema? You're dying. It's just funny gibberish is good. Oh,
01:22:15 another thing that this conversation reminds me of is like sound effects in video games as well.
01:22:20 Like, so we played the Spyro Reignited trilogy a few years ago when it came out. I played through
01:22:26 most of it because I knew the game really well and Kai wasn't familiar with it, so I helped him with a
01:22:32 lot of sections. And like, the Reignited trilogy is really good. It's really solid. I think they
01:22:38 did a great job for the most part. There's a few things that look weird, but for the most part,
01:22:44 everything looks really great. But one of the things I missed that was common in old video games
01:22:48 that they don't do anymore is spamming the same like super like loud sound effect over and over
01:22:53 where it's like the exact same sound effect, like no change in pitch or whatever. Like,
01:22:58 if an enemy is like shooting a laser going, it's like the same like super just in-your-face sound.
01:23:05 But like in the remake, they'll have like six slightly different sound effects that are all
01:23:10 like not quite as loud. And I'm like, no, bring me back the spamming the same like wave font over
01:23:19 and over. I like that. It's like hard to like legitimately advocate for this sort of stuff.
01:23:24 But because it's like, what do you mean you want less quality? That doesn't make any sense. This
01:23:31 is the future. We can have more than one sound effect because we have more space to do it. You
01:23:36 know, technological limitations no longer a limit. And we can do whatever we want. And it's like,
01:23:42 yeah, but I don't like, I liked it when it sucked. Why is it good? It's hard to be that person,
01:23:50 but it's so true so often. I don't like things when they're good.
01:23:56 I mean, I feel when you had just one really like strong sound effect, but you just spam a bunch
01:24:02 of times, it's really impactful and memorable versus oh cool. Now it like it serves a purpose,
01:24:10 but it doesn't stick in my brain. It doesn't make me go, whoa, it doesn't give me chills like it did
01:24:13 when I was a fucking child, I guess. It's hard to know because you're dealing with
01:24:20 very specific types of memories with nostalgia. And it's like how accurately, how objectively can
01:24:27 you really analyze what you're looking at here? So I tend to just throw like the presumption of
01:24:35 knowing what I'm talking about out of the window and just be like, yeah, I agree that it's an
01:24:40 improvement, but I hate it. And you can't argue with that. Why is it? A lot of these things.
01:24:50 Maybe you could make an argument for some things like, well, it was better before and maybe I
01:24:54 would be right, but I don't know. I mean, there are definitely times where like the old thing is
01:25:00 better when it comes to like Apes Odyssey versus New and Tasty. New and Tasty did
01:25:06 genuinely just fuck up a lot of things. Yeah, it often happens. Yeah. It's not always just like
01:25:13 me liking the crappiness of things because it's charming and it's nice and makes me happy sometimes.
01:25:23 It's hard to talk about like that sort of thing where like
01:25:27 without discounting people's genuine experiences with it as their first version of a thing,
01:25:34 like people may have genuine connection to the later versions of a given product
01:25:44 and then not feel as good when they go to the other version. And in that situation,
01:25:50 you could say that the changes do not significantly impact the experience to a point
01:25:57 where it's so much worse one way or the other. It's just actually just a little different and
01:26:03 it's personal preference and there's not actually that much to talk about. But then it could be
01:26:09 like a legitimately big factor in like the enjoyment level. And if I feel like when
01:26:14 that's the case, it's quite obvious because a lot of people find it to be like worse.
01:26:20 I feel like when there's a large amount of people,
01:26:24 it's more likely that it's like, what am I talking about? I don't know what I'm saying.
01:26:29 I'm not a video game analyzer. I've never done this before.
01:26:33 No, never. Virgin Territory for sure.
01:26:37 The Virgin Territory versus the Chad.
01:26:41 Principality.
01:26:42 Prince. Yes. Region.
01:26:46 You know, one remake that was so terrible for one of my favorite games growing up
01:26:53 and it's getting another remake now, which is good, which actually looks a lot better.
01:26:57 But Clanoa, I fucking love Clanoa. It was like.
01:27:02 I'm vaguely familiar with Clanoa.
01:27:05 Clanoa is a really, really good game.
01:27:08 Is that Sonic Zero?
01:27:10 No.
01:27:13 What is that?
01:27:14 I'll get it. Hold on. Let me.
01:27:17 Oh, no. I'm thinking of that flying around thing.
01:27:19 That's Clanoa with tits. I mean, based, but not what I'm looking for.
01:27:23 Like the thing I was thinking of was the thing made by Sega.
01:27:28 There was like a purple magician flying around.
01:27:31 What's that called?
01:27:32 I know. It's this game.
01:27:35 Yeah.
01:27:37 So Clanoa was a game I grew up with.
01:27:39 The original game holds up really well, but simple graphics and everything still look really good.
01:27:43 They're very, very bright and very colorful.
01:27:47 And it got a remake that just the game ended up looking so much worse,
01:27:55 particularly in terms of like the color space.
01:28:01 There's a comparison somewhere.
01:28:04 I'm sure I can pull it up where you'll be able to like see just where is it?
01:28:11 Oh, yeah.
01:28:12 Okay. Okay. I found a comparison.
01:28:14 So like they increased like the polygons and everything,
01:28:18 but the colors are like super like muted and like washed out now.
01:28:22 Oh, wow. That's the downgrade.
01:28:25 Yeah.
01:28:25 That's that's that's art direction.
01:28:28 Oh, no.
01:28:30 Oh, sad.
01:28:34 So that's like one aspect.
01:28:35 But also the characters used to speak in gibberish
01:28:39 and each character sort of had like their own like gibberish language they spoke,
01:28:42 which was really cool.
01:28:43 And then for the remake, they gave English voice acting and they made
01:28:48 Clanoa who had this like cutesy like sort of high-pitched sort of cute voice.
01:28:52 They made them sound like fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.
01:28:55 Far out.
01:28:57 Grabbing crystals.
01:28:58 The villain.
01:29:00 The villain, Gaudius, who is this really tall, spooky looking bird guy in a cloak.
01:29:06 His voice in the original game is like this super like low-pitched distorted like
01:29:11 kind of like thing that's really cool.
01:29:14 And then in the remake, they made him be like, yes, I am British.
01:29:21 Look at that.
01:29:23 Yeah, they gave him the fucking Leviosa voice and they also made him look fucking stupid.
01:29:29 They fucking ruined his face.
01:29:32 Let me see this.
01:29:34 Oh, I'll show you a comparison.
01:29:36 He looks so terrible.
01:29:39 Oh, I don't know.
01:29:41 Oh, I can see that that's like a mental hat now.
01:29:44 They gave him like HD.
01:29:48 Yeah.
01:29:50 The old, they made his eye like completely gone.
01:29:53 What is that?
01:29:54 It looks like a chess piece.
01:29:57 I know.
01:29:58 Like he looks more like a bird like in the original.
01:30:03 Like the front part of his face kind of hooks down like a beak.
01:30:06 And now it's like just a straight shot weird fucking thing.
01:30:13 I don't know.
01:30:13 The Wii remake was bad.
01:30:15 It was awful.
01:30:16 They ruined everything.
01:30:17 But it's getting another remake for the Switch that looks better.
01:30:21 And they're keeping the old voices.
01:30:23 You can still hear like the low fidelity-ness of them.
01:30:29 And it's good.
01:30:30 And I'm glad they're doing that.
01:30:32 And he doesn't look as stupid anymore.
01:30:37 There's something to be said for like, you know, you have a game.
01:30:42 It's on old hardware and the hardware is dying out.
01:30:45 You need to put it on new hardware.
01:30:48 Emulation works most of the time.
01:30:51 Sometimes it's hard.
01:30:52 So like remaking it, future-proofing it for like PC.
01:30:57 It's like, it's a smart thing to do.
01:31:00 It's good for money getting.
01:31:02 But like they always tend to like think, well,
01:31:06 since we're putting it on a thing and we have to remake some of the assets,
01:31:10 why not make them different?
01:31:13 And I feel like when you start doing that, it's very, very dangerous.
01:31:18 You're always, you're likely to ruin things.
01:31:24 I want things to be like preserved in a way that is just the same, usually.
01:31:31 Because like, maybe you could make an improvement here or there.
01:31:35 But like, it's, it's, it worked the first time.
01:31:39 If you make exactly the same, but it just is future-proofed.
01:31:43 That's good.
01:31:44 That can't go wrong.
01:31:46 Who would complain?
01:31:48 Unless you could.
01:31:52 You could.
01:31:54 There's no need for rebirth.
01:31:56 I shall imprison you in darkness and.
01:31:59 And then there's a Switch version, which is like somewhere in between,
01:32:04 but it's better because VI actually looks like it's part of his face again.
01:32:07 He's a very silly looking man.
01:32:11 His voice is fucking cool though.
01:32:13 He speaks distorted, like deep gibberish.
01:32:19 And he says a lot and it's good.
01:32:22 This is pretty good.
01:32:23 It's funny in the first one, their eye looks like it's too far forward.
01:32:27 In a way, like their chin is there and their eye is right above their lip.
01:32:31 Maybe it's, maybe it's just an angle thing, but the last one looks like it makes more sense.
01:32:36 Or at least the camera angle makes it look like it makes more sense.
01:32:40 Yeah, I saw it was like some gripes with it, but they're not as bad as like the middle one.
01:32:45 Oh, fucking, but do you see the problem?
01:32:48 The inherent problem with every three-dimensional thing ever made
01:32:53 post like 1992 or whatever is that there's bloom.
01:32:59 Look at that bloom.
01:32:59 It's bleeding into the, it's bleeding.
01:33:02 I like the flat color of the first one.
01:33:05 That deep black that is like, it's the blackest they could ever possibly be on screen.
01:33:11 No pixels.
01:33:12 The pixels are all gone.
01:33:14 They're turned off and the other one, it's gray because of like light bouncing off it.
01:33:23 I know.
01:33:25 I agree.
01:33:28 It's, it's, it's just, it's nice, you know, I can't complain too much
01:33:34 and it's hard to be like the anti-bloom advocate because like nobody really hates bloom,
01:33:40 except me.
01:33:41 Maybe, maybe, maybe more people hate bloom.
01:33:45 Bloom is fine in moderation, but people just, they just can't fucking help themselves.
01:33:50 It's just that it's-
01:33:51 They have to turn it up to 11 every time.
01:33:53 What annoys me the most is that it's a given.
01:33:56 Like there's no discussion about whether to include bloom for realism purposes
01:34:01 because that's how light works.
01:34:05 You just always have it because it's harder to not have bloom in current game systems.
01:34:12 You can turn it down, you can turn it off, but like I think it's just sort of taken as like
01:34:19 normal that yes, if a game can render anything, it has to have bloom in it and it doesn't.
01:34:28 Yeah, because before you would just have to pick the right color values.
01:34:31 So that they would always look good because the computer is not going to calculate it for you.
01:34:36 You have to like pick, the sky is this shade of blue and it's always going to be this exact
01:34:40 brightness because there's no weird calculations going on.
01:34:43 It just looks at the fucking P and G or whatever and just reads the color value directly from
01:34:49 there and you have to like pick your colors carefully.
01:34:51 Now it's like, oh just get close enough and we have all this lighting and blurring and
01:34:56 shit that's going to change everything and make it too saturated and
01:35:00 bleh. I don't like it.
01:35:06 It's not ideal. I understand that it's like, it's fine.
01:35:11 It works for most things like Mario games. Yeah, yeah, sure. I mean whatever.
01:35:18 I just, I just, I want, I want, I want more people to take an artistic design stance
01:35:24 where they actually make a decision to include it or not,
01:35:30 which is what I'm doing with Pumpkin Alley. There is no bloom in that game, I think.
01:35:35 I will not be, I will design the textures to look a certain way.
01:35:41 They will look that way whether they like it or not.
01:35:45 Like the only time bloom is necessary is for things that are like extremely bright that
01:35:50 would overwhelm the camera sensor. Like if you had like a fucking lighthouse,
01:35:56 you would probably have like a little bit of bloom around like where the light is being
01:36:00 emitted from or if you had like a bright fire, like you'd have some bloom around the fire,
01:36:05 but like pretty subtle and you wouldn't have it like obscuring like half a screen.
01:36:10 In Pumpkin Alley, the fire, I wanted it to, that was one of the first things. I was like,
01:36:14 I don't want it to be like a particle effect. I want it to be like a squishy looking 3D model
01:36:19 of a fire, the warps and wobbles. And then it like, and we made it work. It's like two objects
01:36:27 whippling and wobbling that responds to your movement and then swish left and right. And
01:36:34 it's like, yeah, that's a unique looking fucking thing. Nobody breathes fire like punk.
01:36:39 I still need to find the H Blizzard. Oh my god. You gotta do it. Your gamer crit is on the line.
01:36:47 I still haven't found it. Oh my god. You know, I recently became a gamer and I'm gonna have to
01:36:54 give it all up. I'm gonna have to. Yeah, sorry. You had your chance and you didn't pass. I'm sorry.
01:37:01 Oh no. Yeah, seven out of eight is just not gonna cut it. Our donors, our sponsors won't accept it.
01:37:09 Our sponsors, our donors, who are they? Going back to, you better get back to grinding a smooth
01:37:16 love potions and axes infinity. You get it back on the grind. What is that? You can graduate.
01:37:24 It's like crypto game. It's that crypto game that people from the Philippines were making money at
01:37:29 for a while and then it crashed. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that was on the line go up video. He did
01:37:35 mention it in the line. I've seen it mentioned other places too, but he talked about it. It was
01:37:39 like the most. I can't remember it. That's where I've heard of it. It's little creatures and you
01:37:45 battle them and you make crypto, I don't know. Oh, is it one of those like the player base
01:37:53 can earn money by playing? Yes, it's play to earn, play to earn stuff.
01:37:59 Voluntary indentured servitude. No, it's you make money because you it's like it's raising people
01:38:07 out of poverty. It's like having a job but much worse pay for much longer hours, but it's fun.
01:38:14 So it's fine. It's a video. It's just a video game. They're professional gamers. They go into
01:38:21 the office and they have to just play the video game and they get whipped. They get whipped into
01:38:25 shape with those little things battle. They love it. And then on the taxes, they can write
01:38:30 the occupation gamer like my roommate, Sean. Does your roommate Sean say occupation gamer?
01:38:38 He has like he does like video editing for a let's play channel at EA games. Yeah. And he's
01:38:44 like, I'm a video editor and the tax guy was like, you're a gamer. Just write that down. Really?
01:38:51 That's what I recommend. I always look like a career type as like being in arts and entertainment.
01:38:58 Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Oh, creative freelance work. It's usually
01:39:05 where I go. Creative. I bet you're trying to create new ways to dodge paying your taxes.
01:39:13 Yes, I am crafting the perfect potion to dazzle and confuse the tax man.
01:39:24 They'll come to my door, you know, like they do. They come to the door, say, Texas, please.
01:39:28 And I throw the potion at their feet and the gas goes into their nostrils and they forget all about
01:39:33 it and they leave. And then they I don't have a record of taxes and I still get in trouble.
01:39:41 I have my I have not been I have not been audited yet. Part of a plot of everything
01:39:48 everywhere is that she the ladies getting audited by the tax by the IRS. And it made me very nervous.
01:39:54 It's like, oh man, that doesn't happen to me. I don't have I don't have a good documentation
01:40:00 of anything. I couldn't I couldn't prove like that I bought such and such thing and such and such year.
01:40:09 Jesus. I mean, I don't even like would not like the the purchase history of your Amazon account
01:40:17 or whatever not count. Well, maybe. Yeah, maybe some things I would have an electronic record of.
01:40:24 I definitely don't list enough things. I definitely like undersell myself in terms of like business
01:40:32 expenses. A lot of this stuff is like, I didn't list like specific items, I kind of just like put a
01:40:40 general amount under like things like supplies and like, you know, postage and stuff. And I just
01:40:48 kind of had to like ballpark a number. I didn't really go through and be like, hmm, okay, I bought
01:40:54 this this pack of stamps for sending these letters. And I bought these envelopes. And I bought like
01:41:00 list list items one by one. I do actually do that. I don't write it all down. But I do check
01:41:07 like in a temporary. This is why I'm nervous. This is where I go. This plus this plus this plus
01:41:13 this plus this. And then it's the big money number. I kind of like doing that. I wish I was
01:41:20 chat enough. I wish I was chat enough to like, be like, hey, yeah, so like, all this NSFW art that
01:41:29 I like got off these people's patrons that I pledged to and saved to my reference folder to
01:41:34 reference for my art. That's a business expense, right? I wish I was VAT chat, but I'm not. I'm
01:41:39 a coward. I mean, like, the worry of like, claiming things that are like iffy is that somebody will
01:41:49 come and look at it and be like, um, explain. But like, when will they do that? Why would they do
01:41:57 that? That's like workouts that they had, they would have to spend, they would need a reason to
01:42:02 start doing that.
01:42:06 I just don't take risks. Like the only like things that like I'm certain I can be like
01:42:11 certain about are like, if I'm buying computer parts, because that's literally like, I cannot
01:42:17 do my work without computer parts, that's the only thing I can be like certain of.
01:42:21 Yeah.
01:42:23 Everything else is like, I mean, like it's there's a lot of things that sort of count. And I'm like,
01:42:28 I'm just not kind of, I'll just pay a little more taxes. Fuck it. I don't want to be a sneaky
01:42:35 boy. I think there's a there's a Simpsons episode with taxes where Ned is doing his taxes and he's
01:42:42 like, he has the joke is that he has legitimate excuses for like claiming things on his tax return
01:42:49 or whatever. And he's like, too, like nice. And he's like, Oh, but I can't do that. That would be,
01:42:58 you know, like he's making up reasons why he can't claim anything. And then what Meanwhile,
01:43:04 Homer is like trying to claim that like he has like 17 children and and all these other like
01:43:10 lies. Yeah, if the government asks Bart, you're a veteran, Lisa, you're a you're a nurse,
01:43:19 Maggie, you're a you're a you were wounded in a in a chemical accident. Yeah, stuff like that.
01:43:25 Yeah. It's chemical. So it turned you into a fucking baby on the job on the job worksite
01:43:32 accident. You're on a workman's comp. You returned to a baby by chemicals. Yeah. Sure, whatever.
01:43:39 So watching the Ned Flanders thing, I was like, Okay, I shouldn't be Ned. I certainly
01:43:43 shouldn't be Homer, but at least I know I shouldn't be that frugal, unfrugal. What's the opposite
01:43:48 of I don't know what part it is. A prodig prodigal. Or you're too giveable, you're too generous.
01:43:59 That's in in Dante's Inferno, the two twin the two twin sins in the greed circle of purgatory
01:44:10 are prodigality and parsimony. And parsimony is when you're like miserly, stingy, don't spend
01:44:17 enough money. prodigality is when you are, you know, too free with your money, spend recklessly.
01:44:24 Hence, the Bible story about the prodigal son is the the son that uses his dad's fortune and
01:44:32 goes off and runs off and spends everything and has to come back and be like, I fucked up dad.
01:44:37 I fucked it all. I fucked it all up. I was too poetical. And now I now my soul
01:44:44 burn my soul in hell. My soul will burn on the no, not in hell. No, not in hell. Oh,
01:44:52 prodigality and parsimony are the deadly in heaven. They're not they're not they're not so
01:44:58 bad that you go to hell for them, but they do have to be purged from you on Mount Mount Mount
01:45:05 whatever on your way. Yes, I think that's right. So now you know, now you know some new words.
01:45:16 You're welcome. What what if the Greek gods are like the Boomer gods and the Christian gods are
01:45:21 in there as like we're the new gods now. And the Greek gods are like, yeah, whatever kid.
01:45:27 So they're like, oh, nobody cares about Mount Olympus anymore.
01:45:30 Gods were just the HD remake. I think in I think in in Hades, you have the
01:45:40 there's the the the gun, there's the one gun, the form of the rail gun you have is like Lucifer's
01:45:47 gun. And I think they well, no, they imply that it happened that Lucifer was from the past.
01:45:54 But I mean, I guess that would have been like, pre like Christianity emerging, but like that's
01:46:00 like like the dawn of time or whatever, right? Like the creation of man. So I guess, of course,
01:46:04 that would be in the past. Never mind. That's not a that's not a valid historical record
01:46:09 that I'm citing there. There's no tax return for the beginning of time.
01:46:15 No, I don't think so. You can't audit it.
01:46:21 That's cool. Sure is a cool gun, though. That would be a cool book title. I audited God.
01:46:30 Yeah. And he was sweating. And it's just some sort of a some sort of a tax anime.
01:46:40 Okay, figure it out. That's the premise is the the the prompt for your book.
01:46:50 I'm looking at I'm looking at the Joe Rogan subreddit because I saw boy that this Joe Rogan
01:46:58 subreddit is mad at him because he basically called them all pussies or something for being mad
01:47:04 about Roe v. Wade being overturned. Pretty cool. Classic smooth move. Pretty smooth move, Joe.
01:47:15 They're all going Rogan. Wait, like question mark. How could you
01:47:20 do? Betrayal. Betrayed me.
01:47:29 Habadishery.
01:47:35 Okay. What's going on? What are we talking about?
01:47:40 I think I think that whatever we were saying is over. What do we think about voicemails?
01:47:51 Well, I don't really have a topic. Just a comment. I think I definitely have ADHD and I'm going to
01:47:57 look into going to a doctor and saying, can you just say that I have it? Can you just say it?
01:48:05 And then they'll say it maybe. What makes you think that?
01:48:09 Um, it's just been on my mind. A lot of things line up by watching some videos. I'm like, yep,
01:48:15 yep, yep. That's all true. That's all exactly the case. And it wasn't like YouTubers talking about
01:48:21 it. It was like they're like, um, well, it was a YouTube video, but it was like a psychologist
01:48:29 talking about ADHD and the things, the way you feel and why you end up feeling this way and how
01:48:35 it affects your self-esteem. And, you know, all these things are like, I feel these are normal,
01:48:41 or at least normal to me. And they say they're specifically ADHD related and they talk about
01:48:46 the frontal lobe. And I'm like, that seems sort of credible. I at least want to look into it a
01:48:51 little more because it's been on my mind for a while. I probably just do have it. I don't know
01:48:57 what will change if I know, but at least I won't be lying if I say I do have it.
01:49:02 I've seen ADHD Twitter make long threads about like the memory issues that come with ADHD.
01:49:11 Like in very, very precisely, lining up with issues I have with memory,
01:49:18 where like Kai will come out to the living room, have a whole conversation with me about like
01:49:22 what we're doing for dinner or going to the store or something. And I'll like respond to everything.
01:49:27 And then later, like, I don't remember the conversation and I have no recollection of it.
01:49:32 But like he and my roommates will be able to corroborate that it happened and I just don't
01:49:36 fucking have any memory of it because at the time I was like animating or something and
01:49:42 I guess somehow on autopilot, I managed to do a conversation without
01:49:46 remembering. And this sort of thing happens a lot. It happens way too fucking frequently and
01:49:52 it's scary, but a lot of people on ADHD Twitter were like describing similar experiences they had
01:49:58 and like that that's like part of it. And so I don't know. I mean, I don't have a diagnosis.
01:50:03 Sometimes when I am on a big ADHD moment, I think this people send me pictures of their penis
01:50:10 and they didn't do it. Oh my god. It's all coming together. This was the video. It's like Dr.
01:50:19 Tracy Marks Three Ways ADHD Makes You Think About Yourself. And I was like, oh, very,
01:50:26 very exactly the same as me. Self-esteem. I have good self-esteem though.
01:50:31 Yeah. Yeah. One, you rub it in. Oh, yeah. Rub my penis in. I'll do that too.
01:50:39 That's sexual harassment. That's too far. Jail time. No one, no one. Damn.
01:50:49 Voices. No, no, no, no. You're going to jail. It's a playground voice. I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
01:50:54 I'm a big old cop. I'm a cop. I'm a cop. And you go into jail. It's my favorite.
01:51:00 My favorite donkey. That is my favorite.
01:51:05 voicemail, voicemail. Yeah, voicemail, voicemail, voicemail, voicemail, voicemail,
01:51:12 trans rights, trans rights. What? What about them? Yeah, what about trans wrongs?
01:51:23 Nothing. Two trans wrongs makes a trans right. Oh. So as long as I keep making mistakes.
01:51:31 All right. Trans right angle triangle. Whenever you make a mistake, just do it again. Just do
01:51:37 the second time. Don't learn. Okay, first one is called PCP recommendations. Three, two, one, go.
01:51:47 Hello, Ben and Gibb and whoever else. I am listening to a lot of the PCP. I'm going back.
01:51:56 I'm listening to all sorts of episodes and you know, I'm just kind of picking them at random.
01:52:00 I'm going to go, I'll go and I'll click on them. Be like, oh, that one looks funny. So I'll click
01:52:04 on it and I'll listen to it. Or sometimes I'll look up a host that I like. I'll be like, oh,
01:52:08 what's an episode that monkey was on? What's an episode that Jeff did motherfucking somebody
01:52:14 else was on? I don't fucking know. I don't know why monkeys the only guy I could think of right now.
01:52:19 Anyway, you guys, you, Ben and Gibb and whomever should just help me shout out
01:52:28 episodes that you remember being good. There's too many of the PCP so I can go and listen to them.
01:52:35 The one where that's what you should do. The one help me
01:52:39 episodes. I prefer old stuff just because I like bigger casts. But
01:52:43 if there's anything in the new era that you remember being good and funny,
01:52:46 oh my God, I'm open to it because I'm still listening to current episodes.
01:52:53 Yeah, please. Okay, my recommendation. I don't remember what it's called, but the one with the
01:52:58 them snakes rap. Oh, that episode I can find our number. Jesse edited it. The image was everyone
01:53:08 as angels in the sky or some shit. Yeah, it sounds familiar. Wasn't there a
01:53:17 like a tier list, not a tier list, but like an image, I think tectonic improv did it?
01:53:23 Of like the top PCP episodes. I mean, I don't know if I would have would share his tastes
01:53:32 entirely, but I neither do I. I can't remember the things that happened. I just remember when
01:53:37 people say, Hey, remember when you said life is a cage and death is the key? And it's like,
01:53:41 Yeah, I guess that was a good line. I forget what one that was in though. I can't remember.
01:53:46 I don't. Yeah, I don't remember which episode was which like at all.
01:53:50 No, everyone quotes life is a cage and death is the key because I put that in
01:53:54 the come zone and people like just on rule 34, people will just quote them any image of my
01:54:00 character. I've not seen that before. I've seen it. I see it around. The Vemsnakes wrap episode,
01:54:09 I'm trying to find it the episode where Vemsnakes actually appeared like as a guest at the very end.
01:54:15 I believe that was episode 151. Isn't it the same one that I drew them snakes and put them in
01:54:23 there? That was the one with the wrap, right? Yeah. Yeah, so that was episode 151 of the PCP was
01:54:30 that one. What's it called? The wrap was a few episodes before that. That was episode 148.
01:54:38 Okay. Ben's Kidney Stone. My favorite episodes of the PCP are mostly,
01:54:47 most of them are in like the first hundred or so. I really liked memes that need to die was good.
01:54:55 I really liked the virginity episode. That was a very funny one. I've really listened to it a
01:54:59 bunch. I've shown that to my friends a bunch as well. I mean, everyone knows for yellow episode.
01:55:06 Is the yellow episode just called yellow? Things we can't get into. Things we can't get into.
01:55:12 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And do crazy to think about for years, that was the longest episode.
01:55:18 What's it like three hours? Three hours, 43 minutes. Yeah. Recently, there's been a bunch
01:55:24 that have been longer than that. Yeah. The more the cast contracts, the more the episodes expand.
01:55:32 It's equal and opposite. It seems to mostly happen when there's a guest. Yeah. Like the last four
01:55:40 hour one, nearly five hour one was the last time I was on, then the last four hour one was when Simsie
01:55:45 was on. I guess that's, yeah. I think the, as far as I can remember, the ones where there's loads
01:55:53 of people is the energy level is so high and people like try so hard to get heard over the
01:56:01 cacophony that we all get tired out before we can really go for that long. And that's why they end
01:56:07 so much quicker than just chilling out and relaxed and talking outside the school about
01:56:14 like whatever. It's easier to go on longer when you have space to think and to make pauses in
01:56:22 between your own sentences and breaths. Probably also me only coming on every few weeks recently.
01:56:31 I have more to talk about because I don't come on every week. Yeah. So I tend to drag things out
01:56:36 probably. If I had, if I, if I were not on every week, I would have, you know, I'd have two weeks
01:56:43 worth of nonsense to complain about. There's also no Nate best man whipping everyone to stay on
01:56:52 topic and only talk about one thing so that you exhaust everything you have to say about it and
01:56:57 then the episode's over. Nate's like weird, Nate's weird insistence on like on topic discussion
01:57:05 baffles me to this day. I will never, I've never understood it and I never will.
01:57:12 I can't even remember what it feels like to have Nate on a progress in his podcast.
01:57:22 I've forgotten what our pussy feels like. Next voicemail is called death note fun fact
01:57:29 number one three two one go. Hey everybody, it's me the death note fun fact guy. Here's the death
01:57:37 note fun fact. Did you know that in episode two of death note light is using a PC and L is using
01:57:45 a Mac and that's a fun little Easter egg that shows how opposites they are? No. Yeah, that's the fun
01:57:52 fact. Tune in next week for another death note fun fact. That's a little bit more. That's a little
01:57:57 bit fun. I enjoyed it. I remember death note. Did you watch death note? Death note L using an
01:58:03 Apple and Apple Shinigami's love apples. It's all connected and light and L is eating an orange
01:58:11 in every scene. That's light saying I am eating your computer. Your data is mine. You'll never catch
01:58:17 me. It just means really makes you think and think and think until you can't think no more.
01:58:27 Okay. The next voicemail there's a note that says this dude is just a voicemail character.
01:58:33 Okay. Three, two, one, go. She makes me poop and I make her pee. Why? Because we're flipping
01:58:47 cycles. Finally, a good YouTube video. I'm just smiling because he's having fun. Yeah,
01:59:01 his enthusiasm is infectious. That was a good laugh. Great. Great stuff. Next one is called
01:59:11 Hello. It's short. Three, two, one, go. Do an impression of a former PCP member.
01:59:19 Hey, everybody, it's me, Monkey Jones here. Homie, did you eat all the eat the marshmallows
01:59:30 out of my s'mores, homie? You bitch. What do you think? That was pretty good. Thank you.
01:59:41 That's my Monkey Jones. What do people sound like? My impression of Trixie the Golden Witch is
01:59:48 I like to watch little girls getting fucked. Just say it matter of factly like that with no voice
01:59:54 at all. Just say it over and over again. That was my given impression. Oh, wait, you're still here.
02:00:01 No. Damn it. Wait, what? I can't do an impression of a former PCP member.
02:00:09 We're floundering. Let's go to voicemails. That's Nate. That was, we're floundering.
02:00:14 Hey, Nate. It's Nate. Welcome back. The difference now is that when we flounder,
02:00:19 we just keep floundering. Yeah. The flounder 100% completion rate.
02:00:25 I can do a pretty good mage impression, actually. Yeah. Oh, I get it. You're not talking.
02:00:35 Just, I mean, yeah, you just draw in instead of talking during the podcast. You basically
02:00:39 are the new mage. I kind of am. I'm animating yet somehow make the episodes long. I don't know.
02:00:47 The next one I think is just a text question. It asks, what do you think of the new Mary
02:00:52 Weather logo? And I do not know the Mary Weather logo. I have no opinion about it.
02:01:00 I saw discourse about Mary Weather last night on Twitter randomly and I don't follow Mary
02:01:06 Weather. I think I saw that discourse as well. It was something like they had a comic that was like,
02:01:16 I'm 14 and this is deep, sort of a message to it. It's like, how do you know you exist? Oh my
02:01:24 God, I don't know. And it's an anime girl saying, you know, presenting the idea. Oh, I know the one
02:01:32 you're talking about. It's like, eh, yeah. I mean, sure. In the comic, the guy says, well,
02:01:37 this person's weird, which kind of seems to be the message to me. Look at this weird girl. I don't
02:01:43 know. I don't really get dumb stuff. I don't really get what the point, I don't really get what the
02:01:50 joke is, but like, I don't know. It doesn't seem like there's no way to say that. Wouldn't it be
02:01:57 sexy if a hot anime girl was like having edgy 14 year old brain urizamas? That's probably...
02:02:04 Is that the point? I don't know what the point is. I'm looking at Mary Weather's Twitter. They've
02:02:11 made a follow up to this. They say, clearly I must have made a mistake while writing this because
02:02:15 everyone thinks it's about nihilism. It's just a strange girl talking about consciousness and
02:02:20 the point of view character thinks she's a weirdo. I'm not a nihilist and the girl isn't meant to be
02:02:26 either. All right. Okay. All right. I don't get it though. I think the interpretation I saw is
02:02:38 yeah, sometimes in the subway, you just meet fucking weird people who just talk at you too much
02:02:42 and say weird shit, but what if it was a hot anime woman this time? That seemed to be the
02:02:48 vibe that I... Wouldn't that be crazy? It would. I think it's just the fact that it comes across
02:02:53 totally sincere. I don't even see the punchline if there is one. Yeah. I don't...
02:03:00 If somebody actually thought this, they would draw this comic exactly the same.
02:03:06 Or they would write this comic exactly the same.
02:03:11 I just said there's no real punchline. I don't really know what I'm supposed to take away from it,
02:03:18 so I'm just kind of left shrugging. I don't know. I know. What do I think of the new...
02:03:25 I think you should... Oh, sorry. I was going to say the way you should make it more obvious
02:03:33 is have the guy say, what the fuck? And that'd be the last thing that said,
02:03:37 like, thinking his head. I still wouldn't get it.
02:03:42 Like, there's one little box where he says this girl is weird in his head.
02:03:47 I mean, he says, dot, dot, dot, okay. I mean, that's pretty much like, what the fuck?
02:03:52 But it's not like punchy enough. Gotta have a punch in a punchline.
02:03:58 I don't know if that would fix, would change anything. I don't know. It just has no punchline.
02:04:03 What the comic needs is a punchline, and it doesn't have one.
02:04:07 The punchline is very getting fucked. That's the problem for me.
02:04:13 If she was getting fucked while saying all this stuff, that would be really funny.
02:04:16 Getting groped on the subway by some... What's the word for...
02:04:22 How can you really tell if this person is real roping me? Am I really being groped?
02:04:27 Then it would be like, whole different.
02:04:30 I forget what the Japanese word is for the kind of pervert that gropes women on the subway.
02:04:36 There's a specific word for it. Chikon. Chikon. Yes.
02:04:40 Pikachu.
02:04:42 Is this Chikon really experiencing my supple breasts as he gropes me in the dark subway?
02:04:49 Or is he only a meat puppet?
02:04:52 I feel like that would push it over the edge and to be like, this is absurd.
02:04:55 What the fuck? This girl is crazy. Then it would be a punchline. It would also be
02:05:01 not suitable for work, as they say.
02:05:06 I mean, a lot of Maryweather stuff is a little itchy.
02:05:10 Maybe not on the main account.
02:05:11 I just realized, what we're describing is the character of Uwu Lilia,
02:05:17 C-Toll's, a bimbo character who gains brain cells the more it come she is in contact with.
02:05:25 I see. Gains brain cells? No thanks.
02:05:31 Uwu Lilia.
02:05:32 Yeah, the only way to make her smart is to fill her with coon, Dan Knight.
02:05:38 By the way, about the logo. I mean, I guess the new logo is just a new anime girl,
02:05:43 because I guess he used to use the Internet Explorer girl, but I guess they spun that off
02:05:49 into its own account. Now he made a new girl for Maryweather, and I don't care.
02:05:58 I don't care that that happened.
02:06:00 That's not a logo though. It's just a profile picture of a logo. You can see both of them in
02:06:04 this little video on his Twitter. That's the first one, and then there's a lightning bolt,
02:06:10 and then it turns into this one. There you go.
02:06:16 The logo.
02:06:16 So that's the logo update, those two images.
02:06:19 Oh yeah, that looks like a legit thing.
02:06:24 What does it remind me of? It reminds me of something very specific, and I don't know what it is.
02:06:28 It reminds me of Lion Webtoon. It also has a square speech bubble as its logo.
02:06:36 It's a little like Twitter, I guess. I don't know. I have no opinion about it.
02:06:40 It reminds me of the Sims 4.
02:06:42 Yeah.
02:06:45 Oh, shit.
02:06:47 I fucking, there's a fucking giant gash on the other side of my foot, and I just
02:06:51 foot, and I just scratched it by accident.
02:06:53 Oh no, the demon came out.
02:06:54 I don't know how I got there. I just noticed it was very last night.
02:06:58 That was fucking touch sorts.
02:07:01 Sorry, that happened. Or happy for you.
02:07:05 This sword will fucking slice a baby in half.
02:07:11 Next voicemail is called, what is it? It is called, it's a search.
02:07:19 Here, it's this link.
02:07:21 Yu-Gi-Oh card.
02:07:22 Is it like a Yu-Gi-Oh card database?
02:07:26 Uh-huh. I'm going to search whatever it is.
02:07:29 Is there not a thing to go with it?
02:07:31 No result. No relevant data found. Ben, you're irrelevant.
02:07:35 To Yu-Gi-Oh? True.
02:07:38 The next one is a YouTube link with no elaboration, so I won't acknowledge it.
02:07:46 The next one is called, Bridge Burning Diatribe.
02:07:52 Oh, I can't wait.
02:07:54 It's a minute long. This should be good.
02:07:59 You're just not, you're just not looking hard enough.
02:08:02 Ben-Sane, no.
02:08:05 No.
02:08:07 I will forever douse my bridges in water. You'll never burn them. They'll be soaked.
02:08:14 All right, let's give this a lesson. Three, two, one, go.
02:08:17 During episode 312, in reference to Econ, Ben-Sane said,
02:08:21 I'm not burning this bridge. He's burning the bridge by making me annoyed,
02:08:24 which makes me wonder, how do you treat relationships in general?
02:08:27 Friends should be able to accidentally annoy friends without that turning the relationship
02:08:31 permanently hostile and salt in any attempts to make amends and working towards any middle ground.
02:08:36 For my parasocial relationship of consuming your content, I don't think you
02:08:41 go through most friendships in that way, so I don't know what's different about this case.
02:08:46 Is there some weird behind-the-scenes stuff we're missing?
02:08:49 But if there isn't, it really seems like you're burning a bridge.
02:08:52 You didn't seem open to reconciliation. A colleague just annoyed you and you
02:08:56 responded aggressively and started shit-talking them on the podcast,
02:08:59 after they tried making things up in the end.
02:09:01 You are an idiot.
02:09:02 At least bridge burning stuff does happen like this.
02:09:04 It isn't out of nowhere for no reason deciding to just unperson someone.
02:09:08 It's you to one or both parties being hard-headed and aggressive over some minor issue that crops up.
02:09:13 You are such a cringy lord. You are such a hand-ringing.
02:09:15 That's like sticking to their guns over their association, which ends up ending a friendship.
02:09:19 I feel like I know that you talked about this on the podcast, but this comes across as like,
02:09:26 I want to say this is none of your business, like what?
02:09:29 So scoldy.
02:09:31 So tell me what to do with my- Econ does nothing but annoy me, okay?
02:09:35 It's not that he annoyed me one time. It's that he does nothing but annoy me.
02:09:38 Yeah, I guess that's the simplest it is.
02:09:40 And I don't like it.
02:09:41 Yeah.
02:09:43 It's just the way this guy is approaching this.
02:09:45 Like I'm trying to psychoanalyze you.
02:09:47 Could you please like give me some more information?
02:09:49 Like that's annoying in itself.
02:09:53 Why does it matter to you?
02:09:55 Just seems like Ben is so irrational.
02:09:58 Just seems like Ben just cuts people off for absolutely no reason,
02:10:02 even though he explains that he doesn't do that.
02:10:04 Even though the whole point of what Ben said was that he doesn't do that.
02:10:07 Like I just kind of think that's what he's doing.
02:10:09 What's the deal?
02:10:10 Like a normal thing to do.
02:10:11 It definitely seems that way.
02:10:15 It's just to assume that, yes, there's information that you're missing
02:10:21 and why would you just ask about it?
02:10:25 That's just, I don't know, strange.
02:10:27 The perception is that Ben blows up at people and then when they're like,
02:10:30 wow, Ben, I'm done with your shit.
02:10:32 They're like, ah, see you burned it, even though I attacked you.
02:10:38 That's the perception of how it comes across.
02:10:40 But I don't know enough about the situations,
02:10:43 because I only like half pay attention to this shit when it goes on.
02:10:46 I don't know what shit they say to you.
02:10:48 I can appreciate that it might look like that,
02:10:51 but like the whole point of what I was saying last episode
02:10:54 or whatever episode it was in was that I don't blow up for no reason.
02:10:59 I do it for a reason.
02:11:00 I do it after I have been pushed to the brink.
02:11:04 Yeah.
02:11:05 The one time you definitely burned a bridge was with,
02:11:10 what's it even called, the fucking,
02:11:14 oh god, Team Fortress 2, Brony Analysis Anarchy.
02:11:18 TF2 Analysis Anarchy.
02:11:20 Yeah, yeah.
02:11:22 That's, I mean, that was the one.
02:11:23 It was still really a bridge.
02:11:25 It was just sort of like.
02:11:26 Wait, that was what?
02:11:29 That was so long ago.
02:11:31 I remember there being a section about that,
02:11:34 I think was it in a horseshoe finale or something,
02:11:37 where you told them to get fucked and it was epic.
02:11:40 I don't know if it was in a horseshoe finale.
02:11:43 I don't know.
02:11:44 It was so weird.
02:11:45 I just really didn't like those people.
02:11:47 They just were so, I remember I got pissed at them
02:11:56 and then like Josh Scorcher called me on Skype
02:11:59 and tried to like talk shit out with me.
02:12:01 And he was like so condescending.
02:12:04 And I was like, this guy sucks.
02:12:05 Like why do I even want to work things out?
02:12:08 I don't care that like he's like, I don't know,
02:12:11 relative to me or whatever he was like popular.
02:12:13 He had a bigger following.
02:12:14 Like I just, I don't like him.
02:12:15 I don't like Dr. Wolf.
02:12:16 I don't, I don't like this community.
02:12:18 I don't like their attitude.
02:12:19 I don't care that I got mad and upset them.
02:12:22 Like good.
02:12:24 Was it the Frog Fractions thing?
02:12:28 We did talk about it.
02:12:29 That was like additional.
02:12:30 There was definitely a Jesse video where
02:12:33 Jesse summarized like how he wall broke away from MLP.
02:12:38 And I swear, I swear it was horseshoe.
02:12:41 Was it in one of the footwear reviews
02:12:44 or whatever they were called?
02:12:45 The horseshoe reviews?
02:12:48 I mean, maybe like it.
02:12:52 Was it the time you did the moment with Dr. Horseshoes?
02:12:56 It was after.
02:12:58 Yeah, yeah.
02:12:59 It was around then because that was after
02:13:02 things had broken down between me and those other guys.
02:13:06 And I think it was like a parody we did later.
02:13:09 We got that same guy to animate it.
02:13:10 That was great.
02:13:11 I vaguely recall like, I know the people were in
02:13:16 like the Brony Analysis Skype group because,
02:13:20 you know, that was just the hip hopping place to be
02:13:23 for that sort of stuff.
02:13:24 But everyone left because it was sucked.
02:13:28 And I was in there still.
02:13:29 And I think you were in there for a bit.
02:13:30 And Nate was in there for a bit.
02:13:32 Jesse was in there for a bit.
02:13:35 Rift Cafe.
02:13:35 Yeah, that's what it was.
02:13:37 God, but like, did it happen in there?
02:13:41 Do you remember if you like had a like a,
02:13:43 all right, fuck everyone.
02:13:44 And then you left.
02:13:47 I think I made, you know, I think I made a post
02:13:50 on like a, I think I made like a YouTube comment
02:13:53 on one of the videos in the series,
02:13:56 on one of the TF2 analysis anarchists,
02:13:58 it's basically complaining about how weird it is
02:14:01 that like the plot of the, of the, of the series is
02:14:06 about Josh Scorcher and Ink Rose falling in love
02:14:09 when Josh Scorcher is like 26 and Ink Rose is like 16.
02:14:14 Yeah.
02:14:16 And I think that was what like,
02:14:18 finally it was like the last straw and they were like,
02:14:22 we want to, we don't like you,
02:14:24 but also we want to like talk to you and like,
02:14:26 and we haven't had Josh Scorcher be like,
02:14:28 hey buddy, like what's, what's, what's going,
02:14:31 what's going, what's going on with you, man?
02:14:32 Like, why are you, why are you burning this bridge?
02:14:34 Why are you burning this bridge, man?
02:14:35 Why are you being so, why are you being so irrational, huh?
02:14:38 Why, what are you going to just cut us out of it
02:14:40 as friends because we're just annoyed you just one time?
02:14:42 That's so weird.
02:14:43 Why would you do that?
02:14:44 It doesn't make any sense.
02:14:47 You only really happens.
02:14:48 I mean, those people do mostly suck.
02:14:52 So it's, it's fine.
02:14:53 I think so.
02:14:54 In hindsight, I don't, yeah.
02:14:56 It's, it's being, being away from that is good actually.
02:15:00 Yeah.
02:15:01 In my opinion.
02:15:01 I think that was my sense at the time
02:15:04 and I feel like it is born fruit.
02:15:08 I have been vindicated.
02:15:11 Is this from Horseshoe finale?
02:15:13 Yeah, that is from Horseshoe finale.
02:15:14 Yeah.
02:15:14 That's, that's why I forgot about that.
02:15:16 Yeah.
02:15:16 That's where I heard about it.
02:15:17 I mean, obviously it's very vague, but uh.
02:15:20 I think I, I was already kind of,
02:15:22 I was already kind of on the outs with them because,
02:15:25 and this is funny, I would argue with a guy called Brony Buck
02:15:28 who just was a homophobe.
02:15:30 Oh, fuck that guy.
02:15:31 I know that.
02:15:31 Brony Buck just was like a homophobe
02:15:33 and I would get pissed at him about it
02:15:35 and I would argue and people would get mad at me
02:15:37 for being like mean, for being argumentative.
02:15:40 That's, that's definitely the whole thing in the Rift Cafe
02:15:43 was somebody has a terrible shitty opinion
02:15:46 and somebody gets mad and people get mad.
02:15:50 But getting, but getting mad is the crime.
02:15:51 But getting, getting into an argument is such a heinous crime.
02:15:55 We're Bronies, we have to love and tolerate each other.
02:15:58 We can't tolerate, we can't fight.
02:15:59 Love and tolerate this bigot, please.
02:16:01 It's just like they, they couldn't look beyond the fact
02:16:04 that there was a disagreement happening.
02:16:07 And so they, they just started shaking and shitting
02:16:10 and crying and coming.
02:16:12 That, that was, that was what like led to my relationship
02:16:17 with that group souring.
02:16:18 And then the, the final straw I think was me
02:16:20 leaving that comment about like the age gap
02:16:23 with the Incros and Jeff.
02:16:25 And I was not the first person to point that out.
02:16:27 Other people were talking about it,
02:16:29 but I, I echoed the sentiment in the, in the comments.
02:16:32 Well, we're offended.
02:16:33 We're a sour pus and we don't like sours here.
02:16:37 I was being a big, I was being a big sour pus.
02:16:40 That's not all cops of that much for sure.
02:16:44 Really souring this bridge.
02:16:47 Now it doesn't taste very good.
02:16:50 You know, I mixed some gummies yesterday and I put,
02:16:52 and they came out really sour and I don't know why
02:16:55 because I didn't even add any, any acid.
02:16:57 All the acid that I added to them was from the Shergel.
02:17:00 And yet they came out sour anyway.
02:17:02 And I was like, so confused.
02:17:04 Was it good?
02:17:04 What the fuck was going?
02:17:06 No, it was a little too sour.
02:17:07 It was a little sourer than I wanted.
02:17:09 And I was baffled.
02:17:11 Maybe something went off.
02:17:14 I don't know.
02:17:16 All right.
02:17:17 I knew, I knew, I knew this would go back to gummies.
02:17:19 As soon as I said sour pus, I, I planned for it.
02:17:22 He fell right into my lap.
02:17:24 That was a good, that was a good fun trip down memory lane.
02:17:28 Next one is called, what is a GNU slash Linux?
02:17:34 Right there.
02:17:35 Wait, it's loading.
02:17:36 All right.
02:17:37 Three, two, one, go.
02:17:39 In episode 306, Skip described Linux as a pair down version of Windows,
02:17:43 which is just really wrong.
02:17:45 Linux is its own thing created from scratch.
02:17:47 That's been like a public community project for decades.
02:17:50 Fundamentally, it's a bit more similar to macOS,
02:17:52 but it's different enough to pretty much be considered its own thing.
02:17:57 That's why you need to target it separately for games and shit.
02:18:02 I don't remember saying it was Windows.
02:18:05 I maybe used it as a, like likened it to Windows, but without like,
02:18:10 well, that's the way my brother, because my brother knows how to do Linux stuff.
02:18:15 And he explained it as, imagine if Windows wasn't like,
02:18:19 it didn't take an hour to load everything.
02:18:22 I mean, I mean, it is similar to Windows in that it is an operating system.
02:18:27 Yeah.
02:18:27 I mean, we don't have Mac, so that's how he described it.
02:18:29 It is similar to Windows.
02:18:30 I'm sorry to have made a technical error.
02:18:34 Yeah.
02:18:34 It's similar to Windows in that like, people who,
02:18:38 like the sort of crowd who uses Linux is more similar to like,
02:18:42 the crowds of people who do coding shit on Windows.
02:18:45 Like they're similar, like demographics.
02:18:48 Yeah.
02:18:48 I mean, I don't know the code in the back.
02:18:50 It's just sort of like, Linux is for nerds.
02:18:54 Yeah.
02:18:55 And Windows is for people.
02:18:57 It's for the real tech heads.
02:18:59 And Windows is for nerds in training, and Mac is for different.
02:19:03 It's for normies.
02:19:04 Mac is for normies or like, artists who are like,
02:19:08 not technically minded, I guess.
02:19:10 Yeah.
02:19:12 Macs are good for music.
02:19:13 I think I've learned that at some point.
02:19:15 I have like, I've heard that.
02:19:16 I have never.
02:19:16 I've heard people who've switched to Mac who've said it's good.
02:19:19 And I'm like,
02:19:20 The only Macs I ever used were like the iMacs at my school,
02:19:23 like computer lab in high school.
02:19:26 Windows is starting to get so bad,
02:19:28 but I might have to consider another operating system in a few years.
02:19:31 Because I really don't like the look of Windows 11,
02:19:34 but Windows 10 isn't going to be supported forever.
02:19:37 I mean, I use a, yeah, I use like,
02:19:41 I think I use Windows 10,
02:19:42 but with like a shell that makes it look like Windows 7.
02:19:47 Oh, yeah.
02:19:48 I mean, I like the look of Windows 10.
02:19:50 I'm just worried about the security updates eventually running out,
02:19:54 and then it being a security risk for me to keep using it after a certain point.
02:19:59 Yeah, that's, that's fair.
02:20:01 That's more forward thinking than I am.
02:20:03 Yeah.
02:20:04 My friends who switched to it,
02:20:05 I mean, aside from the tracking shit being even more annoying to disable,
02:20:09 it's also just slow.
02:20:11 It's just slow and buggy and bad is what I hear.
02:20:15 How do you make an,
02:20:17 how do you just make it worse?
02:20:18 I don't understand.
02:20:20 You hire people to do a job,
02:20:21 and then they just have to do something.
02:20:23 So I fuck it up for, for a while.
02:20:25 They just add code that fucks it up.
02:20:28 Good for them.
02:20:29 Glad I'm glad they're working.
02:20:31 Or YouTube's new like video description layout looking fucking terrible.
02:20:35 The views and the date and the first line of the description are all next to each other,
02:20:39 and it just fucks up my brain.
02:20:39 I can't see the date anymore.
02:20:41 Whenever I try to see when a video, a YouTube video was posted,
02:20:44 I find myself like, I can't find it.
02:20:46 The date is there, it's next to the view count,
02:20:47 and the same bold font with not enough,
02:20:50 with no like real differentiator between them.
02:20:53 You can see it on the screen.
02:20:56 Am I seeing an old thing then?
02:20:58 My YouTube has not changed recently.
02:21:00 Yeah, it updates for different people at different times.
02:21:03 It depends on when your cookies decide they want to refresh.
02:21:06 Mine changed like two days ago,
02:21:08 and I'm so fucking mad.
02:21:09 I can't fucking read anything.
02:21:12 And I don't even have dyslexia,
02:21:13 and this is like fucking up my eyeballs,
02:21:15 trying to like find the date, find the view count.
02:21:17 It's so hard now.
02:21:19 It was perfectly fine.
02:21:21 Why did they do this?
02:21:22 Yeah, I'm looking at this Brony screenshot,
02:21:24 and I don't know, mine doesn't look like that.
02:21:27 Yeah, it will soon.
02:21:30 No.
02:21:31 Oh, is that so?
02:21:32 It goes views, date, description, immediately.
02:21:36 No differentiation, no blinds.
02:21:39 It's ugly.
02:21:40 And also the button to click on the channel
02:21:43 is now at the bottom of the description.
02:21:46 So if you open the description,
02:21:47 I'll take a screenshot on this episode of the PCP.
02:21:50 The channel icon's at the bottom by the comments.
02:21:53 It's weird.
02:21:55 And also the font is different.
02:21:57 Like the font for the title of the video
02:21:59 is also different and harder to read.
02:22:02 I don't, I don't get it.
02:22:04 I could imagine it's for mobile stuff,
02:22:07 like you're scrolling down past the description.
02:22:09 I'm not.
02:22:09 By the way, would you like to subscribe?
02:22:12 I'm not on a fucking mobile phone.
02:22:16 Well, get with the program.
02:22:19 There's never ever going to be a desktop anymore.
02:22:21 It's all going to be in the palm of your hand.
02:22:24 Shorts, you can't rewind or like, you know,
02:22:28 find your way, click to a middle of a video.
02:22:30 You can only play.
02:22:31 It is no way to rewind or anything.
02:22:33 It's annoying.
02:22:33 Shorts are kind of unbearable to like use it,
02:22:39 like with the user interface.
02:22:42 I click on one, I'm like, oh, it moves.
02:22:44 It's clicked onto the next one in like the algorithm queue.
02:22:48 So I go back and then just replays the new one
02:22:52 that I was just trying to get away from.
02:22:54 And then I try to go back further than that.
02:22:55 And it's just, I just, I have to turn off the whole thing.
02:23:00 I close the entire tab out of frustration.
02:23:02 I can't believe how annoying YouTube shorts are on desktop.
02:23:07 I don't know why I would watch them on desktop.
02:23:09 I don't think I've ever clicked on a short and I never will.
02:23:12 They just sometimes appear where it's like, here's a video.
02:23:15 Here's a video.
02:23:16 Here's a YouTube short.
02:23:17 Click on this one.
02:23:19 And I sometimes do.
02:23:20 I know.
02:23:21 And then you're locked into like the shorts.
02:23:22 And then like, I try to like scroll.
02:23:24 And then it's like, oh, you're locked vertical.
02:23:26 And there's just a vertical strip of videos with all this empty space.
02:23:29 That part of it, the scrolling is so, because it's like they have the short
02:23:33 playing and then like underneath it is the short that's coming up.
02:23:38 And if you scroll, you skip to the second one.
02:23:42 I usually scroll when I click on a video to see the comments to see the description,
02:23:46 but there is none for YouTube shorts.
02:23:48 And simply by scrolling, the next video starts playing and the audio disappears.
02:23:53 And it's like, fuck off.
02:23:55 You're ruining my day.
02:23:57 It's like, what if we did it bad?
02:23:59 That's YouTube.
02:24:00 That's YouTube in a nutshell.
02:24:02 What if we did it bad?
02:24:04 You know, we had like a good like six years where like,
02:24:08 like the only complaints about YouTube were about like internal stuff.
02:24:11 So like the UI and layout was fine.
02:24:13 Because we remember like background like 2010 to 2014,
02:24:16 YouTube would update their layout every like year or two and everyone would be mad.
02:24:20 Like they kept it pretty good for a while and now they're fucking it again.
02:24:24 Yeah, they got to pay people to do nothing.
02:24:27 Did you see, okay, I'm sorry to change the subject, but I remembered something.
02:24:33 Did you see by any chance the latest stupid Peter Coffin take on Twitter?
02:24:39 Do you know who that is?
02:24:40 I don't follow it.
02:24:40 Peter Coffin walks out of his grave.
02:24:43 Get it back in there.
02:24:45 Peter, all right.
02:24:47 I won't explain who he is, but the point is he made a tweet about like,
02:24:52 he was like annoyed that people were like,
02:24:55 somebody wore a fursuit to like a pro unionized Starbucks thing.
02:25:00 Yes, I saw that.
02:25:00 And he's like, he said it was unserious.
02:25:04 And like, I mean, look, look, look at this.
02:25:07 Look at this guy.
02:25:09 A real, a real serious academic rooted in materialist dialectical theory.
02:25:21 What does he, what does he, what?
02:25:26 That's a, that's a good Papa Smurf beard, actually.
02:25:28 It's a very blue beard.
02:25:30 Sure.
02:25:31 Yeah, it looks all right.
02:25:33 It looks all right if that's what he's going for.
02:25:35 Is he's going for the Papa Smurf American?
02:25:41 Anyway, just, just, just scrolled by that and remembered that it gave me a chuckle.
02:25:48 A chuckle and a heckle.
02:25:51 The next one.
02:25:53 Okay.
02:25:53 Next one.
02:25:54 I posted it up a little while ago.
02:25:56 It's called Michael Jackson trans race.
02:25:59 Three, two, one, go.
02:26:01 In episode 307, you guys were talking about transracialism and ended up saying that like
02:26:06 Michael Jackson is transracial or maybe an example of being transracial,
02:26:10 which as far as I can tell, isn't true.
02:26:13 It seems like he just had a skin condition which turned parts of his skin white,
02:26:17 which was initially covering up with gloves and shit.
02:26:20 But eventually it got so bad that he decided to just bleach his entire body so that it
02:26:24 would all have a uniform color instead of having some blotches everywhere.
02:26:27 So it wasn't really done out of a change in racial identity,
02:26:30 but because of the skin condition.
02:26:32 Well, sounds like you, sounds like you know more about it than I do.
02:26:35 I know all about Ben's skin condition.
02:26:41 What does that mean?
02:26:42 My skin, I'm turning, I'm turning black.
02:26:46 Joe Biden sucked out, he said, you ain't black if you don't vote for me.
02:26:49 And he sucked out all the blackness from people and then he's giving it to me slowly.
02:26:54 Just to you.
02:26:55 We worked, we worked out a deal.
02:26:57 Yeah.
02:26:58 The next one is, okay, the next one is will the Switch 2 come soon and then the Nintendo
02:27:06 and then Switch 2 and then that's what I'm talking about.
02:27:10 I hope it does.
02:27:10 I'm hyped for it.
02:27:13 I don't know.
02:27:15 No, why would they make a Switch 2?
02:27:16 Everybody loves the Switch.
02:27:22 Didn't they already make like a version of the Switch that was like OLED?
02:27:27 Did they make like a light version or something?
02:27:29 Yeah, or like a version that doesn't have the disconnected controllers,
02:27:32 it's like entirely portable.
02:27:35 Yeah, I think that sounds familiar.
02:27:38 They probably did and good for them.
02:27:41 They call it the stationary because you don't change it.
02:27:44 You don't switch it.
02:27:45 I don't see why, I don't see why they would make a Switch replacement
02:27:50 while the Switch is still dominating.
02:27:53 So probably not anytime soon.
02:27:57 What would they even put on the Switch 2?
02:27:59 What would they do with a Switch 2 that they couldn't do with a Switch?
02:28:03 They could put it as a VR headset as well.
02:28:07 Now that, honestly, yeah, why wouldn't Nintendo make a VR console?
02:28:16 It's kind of, the technology has come a long way and it sort of works.
02:28:19 Yeah, it's strange.
02:28:20 Nintendo is, oh no, I think they have done something VR related
02:28:27 with like the cardboard thing.
02:28:29 What was that?
02:28:30 The Nintendo Labo?
02:28:33 I feel like there was like a VR, a cardboard thing that you put on your head
02:28:37 and like some of the games are in that.
02:28:40 Or maybe I'm just misremembering.
02:28:41 That sounds familiar.
02:28:42 I didn't know if it was a Nintendo thing.
02:28:45 No, no, no, you just put your phone,
02:28:47 you just put your phone into the little cardboard thing.
02:28:50 That's that thing.
02:28:51 No, the Nintendo Labo thing, I saw German make it and it's like a gun
02:28:56 or some sort of like shooty thing and it's like a visor.
02:28:59 And you put the Nintendo Switch screen and you put it up to your face
02:29:03 and then it's like you're shooting in VR kind of with the, I don't fucking remember.
02:29:09 Okay, sounds interesting.
02:29:13 It sounds like a Nintendo gimmick.
02:29:16 I feel like they would have, they should have,
02:29:17 not that they should have, but they would have done more with VR.
02:29:21 Seems like they're sort of wheelhouse.
02:29:23 I feel like they could do a VR console.
02:29:26 Yeah, maybe they're gun shy since the virtual boy.
02:29:31 They got to come back, they got to come back with the virtual
02:29:36 man.
02:29:37 The virtual non-binary.
02:29:41 The virtual baby.
02:29:44 Yeah.
02:29:46 Next one is called Notability, the downfall of Wikipedia.
02:29:51 Three, two, one, go.
02:29:53 In episode 312, y'all talked about an article getting removed from Wikipedia
02:29:56 for not being notable as if that meant it got too few page visits or something
02:30:00 and started saying stuff like, oh no, will this article get deleted
02:30:04 if no one looks at it 10 years from now?
02:30:06 But that's just not what notable means.
02:30:08 On Wikipedia, notable just means multiple news organizations,
02:30:11 published articles about this place person or thing.
02:30:15 So no, this isn't some slippery slope that'll destroy Wikipedia.
02:30:18 It's a policy that they've heard consistently for over a decade.
02:30:21 Okay, so maybe I didn't understand what the word
02:30:25 Notability meant in that context.
02:30:26 However, I remember we were talking about David Firth,
02:30:29 and David Firth is most definitely a notable animator
02:30:32 who should be, who should have a Wikipedia article.
02:30:35 So by that, if that's the standard, then it's a bad standard.
02:30:42 Like, yeah, he hasn't been published in a lot of major outlets or anything,
02:30:46 but that's fine.
02:30:48 He shouldn't have to be.
02:30:49 Yeah.
02:30:50 He's notable, dammit.
02:30:53 Like, I don't know.
02:30:54 I don't like the tone of this guy.
02:30:56 He's a little nitpicker.
02:30:58 He's going around trying to pick us with nits.
02:31:01 Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.
02:31:04 Like, isn't it clear from our discussion that it's these small technical foibles
02:31:11 and things are not the meat of the conversation clearly,
02:31:15 that the point is that David Firth, having his Wikipedia removed,
02:31:19 shouldn't have happened, and that's why we're talking about it in that way?
02:31:23 Like, you floated the idea of page visits, and then the conversation stared into you talking
02:31:28 about published media articles and stuff.
02:31:31 You did get to the correct conclusion eventually.
02:31:34 I remember, I listened to it yesterday.
02:31:36 Well, fuck.
02:31:37 So I don't get ways correcting you.
02:31:39 What does this guy want?
02:31:39 When you already said the correct thing afterwards.
02:31:43 I think this guy might have broken rule one and not listened to the whole episode
02:31:46 before he made his voicemails.
02:31:47 Maybe, like, I think it's a shame David Firth's thing got deleted,
02:31:51 because he is a very notable person.
02:31:53 And I'm sure this fucking article is mentioning salad fingers.
02:31:56 I swear, like, whoa, look at this creepy cartoon.
02:32:00 Like, that's probably happened.
02:32:02 Like, everybody knows salad fingers.
02:32:04 Yeah.
02:32:06 Um, it's ridiculous.
02:32:07 Like, the reason to complain is that, like, the definition of notable is flawed,
02:32:13 because there are plenty of things that are important that aren't necessarily mentioned
02:32:16 by mainstream media.
02:32:19 Exactly.
02:32:19 That are significant.
02:32:20 That's kind of the point.
02:32:22 Yeah.
02:32:22 Which, again, was discussed last week, so I don't get this voicemail.
02:32:26 I feel like there's something.
02:32:27 He's nitpicking.
02:32:28 If he's going to pit more nicks.
02:32:32 I'm the nitpick nerd.
02:32:35 You better have a good argument next time.
02:32:37 He's the, he's a new, new, new, new Nate fucker called the Nate Picker.
02:32:42 He's Nate.
02:32:43 He, he, he picks every episode, see if Nate's in it.
02:32:53 Next one is called, um, Tom upload the podcasts to Apple podcasts.
02:32:58 I, right, I have a feeling I know what this one's going to be about, but three, two, one, go.
02:33:02 Hey, Ben, you know, remember, uh, behind the bastards, uh, Robert Evans podcast from like a
02:33:09 year or so ago?
02:33:09 Yeah.
02:33:10 So anyway, I never listened to it.
02:33:11 He didn't, he did an episode or a two part episode on Christine Weston Chandler.
02:33:15 And I thought that you would find it interesting and funny and sad and shit.
02:33:19 Perhaps.
02:33:19 And yeah, now you and all the listeners know about it.
02:33:22 Bye.
02:33:23 Okay.
02:33:24 That's kind of funny.
02:33:26 I thought he did about like historical figures.
02:33:29 It's kind of funny.
02:33:29 He would do a Chris Chan episode.
02:33:31 Hey, who?
02:33:33 The, this, this podcast is about, uh, this behind, behind the bastards.
02:33:37 It's like telling the story of like villains from history.
02:33:40 I think that's what it's all about.
02:33:42 Dictate, like dictators and stuff.
02:33:43 Classic, classic villain of history.
02:33:46 Some idiot that got trolled online.
02:33:51 Dude, she like, I, she like curse you homie hard like so many people.
02:33:56 She did do some serious.
02:33:57 Did Hitler do that?
02:33:58 Don't think so.
02:34:00 Her kid.
02:34:00 Look at him.
02:34:02 Kersi, how me, huh?
02:34:02 Even a single.
02:34:03 If they, they better mention the bicarbonate rain holocaust.
02:34:07 Oh my God.
02:34:08 Honestly, many worlds.
02:34:10 She did carry out a Holocaust that she felt was a legitimate act of, you know,
02:34:15 but by her definition would be a legitimate act of genocide.
02:34:18 She did do that.
02:34:22 She believes she did it.
02:34:25 Yeah.
02:34:25 She believes that these characters are real people
02:34:28 and that she eliminated 70,000 of them with a artificial weather event.
02:34:35 With chemical weapons.
02:34:37 Chemical weapons, yes.
02:34:39 In violation of the Geneva Convention.
02:34:46 To quote, to quote Goose Goose from that, that half life commentary video.
02:34:52 I do not believe that Christian Western Chandler even read the Geneva
02:34:56 conventions much less ratified them.
02:35:00 Or Quickville, I guess I should say.
02:35:01 Ratified them.
02:35:03 Yeah, you have to rat, you have to vote, you have to ratify them.
02:35:06 Turn them into a rat.
02:35:07 In NATO or something like that.
02:35:09 To the king of the rats.
02:35:12 Next one is called, will Ben ever pay his taxes?
02:35:15 Three, two, one, go.
02:35:17 No, absolutely not.
02:35:22 I did pay my tax.
02:35:24 I already paid them.
02:35:25 Yeah, that's a good clip.
02:35:27 That's a good clip to use.
02:35:29 Absolutely not.
02:35:30 Laugh some a night.
02:35:32 I'm going to download that one.
02:35:35 That's pretty good.
02:35:38 All right, next one is a tweet from Drinking Moth.
02:35:41 So reincarnated Samurai Sama wasn't Mages but Maze, huh?
02:35:45 Okay, I'll draw American one too then.
02:35:47 Alexa, play Kill la Kill.
02:35:50 Opening two.
02:35:52 Oh, we've got a whole.
02:35:53 Look out those are the snakes.
02:35:55 In the fire.
02:35:55 Oh, they are Kawasaki clan of greatness.
02:35:58 Once protectors of voice jail were wiped out in one sentence by the traitor Tommy J.
02:36:04 He unleashed them snakes the serpent thousand times or Ruchi's worse.
02:36:08 Oh, it's a it's a poem.
02:36:09 Save the scroll.
02:36:10 Don't be ignorant.
02:36:11 Flew young boy full of remorse.
02:36:13 Even then Ben St.
02:36:14 What villain stole the Kawasaki scroll with no spirit or somebody Samurai Sama.
02:36:20 Samusama died all alone.
02:36:22 But the rage of Kawasaki yet still burns like flame them snakes.
02:36:26 His soul split like teriyaki to a tone for past mistake.
02:36:33 America was always a country of cowards.
02:36:35 Nobody is ready to take up arms and fight against oppression.
02:36:39 Latvia was never anything special in the grand scheme of things.
02:36:42 There's no one daring to make a statement of their existence.
02:36:47 I don't know what's what's that in the guitar like foam?
02:36:52 Yeah, it looks like styrofoam.
02:36:54 I will change it with the power of the Kawasaki scroll.
02:36:57 Do they mean Lithuania?
02:36:59 Because mage is from Lithuania.
02:37:00 I think they I think they mean to say Lithuania.
02:37:03 Oh, no.
02:37:03 Also, why is she missing an arm?
02:37:06 Oh, she's she's getting ready to cosplay.
02:37:10 A zooming.
02:37:11 Yeah, exactly.
02:37:15 One soul, two bodies, two dreams, one target.
02:37:19 Oh my god.
02:37:20 Wow.
02:37:21 Remind me to commission drinking moth for.
02:37:25 Yeah, I need some art when I do the League of Nightfuckers
02:37:29 compilation video.
02:37:33 I had I had had some art in my mind for like a year that I'm too tired to draw.
02:37:38 But drinking moth got the goods.
02:37:41 This is very this is very funny.
02:37:43 This is bowling ball on a club nun chuck.
02:37:49 I guess.
02:37:50 So I guess this is Ethan Ralph's daughter.
02:37:53 So Ethan Ralph's daughter, mage's daughter fighting over the Kawasaki scroll
02:38:02 for their own ends and fighting over it.
02:38:05 It was.
02:38:06 Yeah, I mean.
02:38:07 Why does she have a bowling ball on a chain?
02:38:09 Simple as could be.
02:38:10 I don't.
02:38:11 Oh, because she was born at or she was.
02:38:13 No, her parents were married at a bowling alley.
02:38:16 Oh my god.
02:38:17 Maybe she was also born in one as well.
02:38:19 I don't know.
02:38:20 Yeah.
02:38:23 Wait.
02:38:24 Born in a bowling alley, like in the alley, like with the bowling balls flying past drinking.
02:38:30 Drinking moth gave the the sword is based on the Latvian flag.
02:38:34 It's the wrong country.
02:38:36 No, it's okay.
02:38:37 But it looks so good, though.
02:38:39 Yeah.
02:38:41 It looks really good.
02:38:43 Thank thank you.
02:38:44 Thank you for these very.
02:38:46 I'm very I'm very chuck.
02:38:48 Chuckled.
02:38:49 I'm chuffed.
02:38:50 Chuffed was the word.
02:38:52 Chuffled.
02:38:52 Uh, next, next one is a Vokeru link.
02:38:57 I'll put it right here.
02:38:59 Okay, uh, in three, two, one, go.
02:39:02 Hi, this is drinking moth again.
02:39:04 Him, Twilight, can you switch my voice?
02:39:07 Sure.
02:39:08 I believe this is the button.
02:39:10 One, one, one, two, three.
02:39:12 Hmm, this isn't quite ideal yet.
02:39:15 So, see, you need to press twice and then rotate.
02:39:20 So, as you might have already guessed, I am the creator of Twilight Sparkle Saga.
02:39:25 Sorry for sending some red herring shittier voicemails.
02:39:28 Hey, if you have any questions about the whole thing, feel free to ask.
02:39:33 Now that narrative is over, I will answer them clearly.
02:39:36 Also, as a long time listener, I must say my thanks.
02:39:41 Ben, you were the reason I started making comics.
02:39:44 I just caught you once drawing vapors on stream.
02:39:47 Gib, your baby jail.
02:39:49 Jail babe.
02:39:51 Whatever.
02:39:52 Shown me that you don't need to have super pretty hyper realistic art
02:39:55 to tell an engaging story.
02:39:57 Oblivionfall, thanks for showing me voicemeter.
02:40:01 None of this would have happened if I had to register at every SFX site,
02:40:05 download every YouTube video and pay for every text to speech or deep fake server.
02:40:10 And of course, thanks to every guest and audience of PCP for listening.
02:40:15 Good night, space cowboy.
02:40:18 Aren't you forgetting something?
02:40:20 Ah, right.
02:40:21 I will fuck Nate.
02:40:23 Yes!
02:40:23 I will fuck Nate.
02:40:24 I will fuck Nate.
02:40:26 I will fuck Nate.
02:40:28 I will fuck Nate.
02:40:29 I will fuck Nate.
02:40:30 I'll fuck Nate.
02:40:32 Even I have you fuck Nate.
02:40:34 Oh yeah.
02:40:35 Fakayuri no sento sama and sayonara.
02:40:41 Thank you, drinking mom.
02:40:43 That was great.
02:40:44 Hell yeah.
02:40:45 You know, and right after I already was ready to commission them for some Nate fucker,
02:40:49 they just come out here with this.
02:40:51 Oh, perfect, perfect for the job.
02:40:53 I'll hit you up and maybe like a week or two and I'm ready to edit that.
02:40:58 I'll sketch up an image and if you're open, I'll give you money.
02:41:04 I'm sorry.
02:41:04 I'm sorry I tricked you into drawing comics like a fool.
02:41:08 I'm sorry.
02:41:09 I spread the curse.
02:41:12 The art's generally good.
02:41:13 I love how the snakes look.
02:41:16 The snakes are amazing.
02:41:17 I really love that.
02:41:19 Yeah, it looks really good.
02:41:20 But the pose for the Lithuanian girl, like the way like her like the like the line of action,
02:41:24 how her body is like slanted, leaning back.
02:41:27 Very, very nice pose.
02:41:29 Very nice.
02:41:30 It's very good stuff.
02:41:32 Yeah, yeah.
02:41:34 What can I say?
02:41:36 It's just great.
02:41:37 Shout outs.
02:41:37 Shout outs to Drinking Moth.
02:41:39 Shout out.
02:41:39 Thanks for everything.
02:41:42 Let's.
02:41:43 All right.
02:41:44 Next one is the, it's an image or link.
02:41:47 Let's see what we got.
02:41:51 Oh.
02:41:54 Oh, okay.
02:41:56 Okay, I'm glad you enjoyed the ride.
02:41:58 I see.
02:41:58 Oh, it's, it's, yes, I get it.
02:42:01 I think.
02:42:03 They're all, they're all ready to fuck Nate.
02:42:07 That, that Twilight Sparkle does want to fuck Ben.
02:42:12 It's true.
02:42:13 We're Celestia to save you.
02:42:17 Why is Yahtzee?
02:42:19 I think Yahtzee was, was one of the voices right at the end.
02:42:22 Yeah, one of the Texas.
02:42:22 Oh, I'm not sure who some of these are.
02:42:27 Is that Linkara?
02:42:29 Linkara.
02:42:29 I don't know who that guy is between Yahtzee and Linkara.
02:42:32 That must be the grandpa.
02:42:33 That must be Twilight's grandpa.
02:42:34 Oh, they said to us for questions.
02:42:36 I have one question.
02:42:40 Could you put your voicemails in like a video in like order
02:42:45 so we can experience the whole thing?
02:42:47 Yeah.
02:42:48 In one big like, ah, go.
02:42:50 Oh, that would be nice.
02:42:51 That'd be nice.
02:42:51 Yeah.
02:42:52 So we can go back to it.
02:42:55 Is that, is it them snakes holding that green thing?
02:43:00 It looks too fuzzy to be them snakes.
02:43:02 It's got like hands and like wings.
02:43:05 Some kind of demon, some kind of shadow demon.
02:43:08 There was, there was some kind of like spooky shadowy voice
02:43:10 and one of the voicemails from them, so.
02:43:15 No, Nate.
02:43:17 Is that drinking moth in the middle?
02:43:19 Is that them?
02:43:21 I possibly.
02:43:22 With the sans eye?
02:43:24 I don't know who else it could be.
02:43:26 Yeah, it must, it must be.
02:43:28 I don't know who the woman on the front of the face,
02:43:30 but she sure is far left.
02:43:33 She's cute.
02:43:35 Yeah.
02:43:35 She's a, she's a, I don't know who, I don't know who it is either.
02:43:39 She's one of the good blondes.
02:43:45 Yes.
02:43:46 Next, next one, next voicemail is called.
02:43:51 Wait, I don't think I, yeah, I did.
02:43:54 Okay, here it's called.
02:43:56 Three, two, one, go.
02:44:00 Okay.
02:44:00 Yep, I agree.
02:44:01 Good voicemail.
02:44:03 Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder Play Delta Room Chapter Two.
02:44:09 Okay, next one is called,
02:44:10 If Nobody Threw Any Bricks Through Any Windows, What's The Po?
02:44:14 I don't know.
02:44:16 The next one is called Your Bugs.
02:44:20 Here, there we go.
02:44:23 Three, three, two, one, go.
02:44:26 And in a way, it's kind of a puzzle game, you know?
02:44:29 You're just, you're trying to figure out how to render each bug snack catchable.
02:44:34 And you can use anything at your disposal, you know?
02:44:36 You've got your tools and you can even like shoot different kinds of sauce all around to like,
02:44:42 you know, lead a bug snack one way or the other.
02:44:45 They hate some things.
02:44:46 They love some things.
02:44:47 You can use elements from the environment and you can even use other bug snacks,
02:44:51 you know, make a fight, make a hit each other, set them on fire, all sorts of stuff.
02:44:55 And it is really fun.
02:44:56 I don't understand.
02:44:59 What's the significance of the clip?
02:45:01 I think it's just Arlo saying funny things about bugs.
02:45:04 You're bugging me.
02:45:05 It's a game called Bug Snacks.
02:45:08 He's talking about where, where you like, it's like Pokemon Snap,
02:45:13 but with bug things kind of.
02:45:15 I don't know.
02:45:17 Cool.
02:45:18 Sounds good.
02:45:20 I don't know.
02:45:21 Whatever.
02:45:22 Okay.
02:45:22 Next voicemail is called your best and worst PCP episode ever or best and worst.
02:45:27 It's just a question.
02:45:29 I already said the best one is the them snakes rap.
02:45:34 Worst one is this one that you're listening to right now.
02:45:37 I'd say the worst one is the last one.
02:45:40 Oh, yeah.
02:45:41 Because we're only going up.
02:45:46 I don't have a favorite.
02:45:48 We already got a question about like good voicemail,
02:45:51 voicemail episode recommendations.
02:45:53 The virginity episode is still one of my favorites of all time.
02:45:57 Just because it's so, I've really listened to it so many times.
02:46:01 I do remember we all didn't, we all thought monsters was a terrible
02:46:04 topic and we all agreed that it sucked.
02:46:07 I mean, I listened to it and I thought it was fine.
02:46:10 And then afterwards when everyone hated it, I mean, like, I mean, it wasn't that bad.
02:46:14 It wasn't great, but it was just kind of.
02:46:17 Was I not on that one?
02:46:18 I keep thinking that I wasn't on it.
02:46:20 I'm not sure.
02:46:21 You're on Monsters Free because you shut up with a voice changer and it was funny.
02:46:25 Oh, yeah.
02:46:26 So I skipped the worst episode.
02:46:29 I just remember us all like not having anything to say about monsters.
02:46:34 Yeah, from the grapevine, it seemed like it was a topic episode that literally
02:46:39 nobody had any reason to talk about.
02:46:42 Mm-hmm.
02:46:43 But the the topic must go on, I guess.
02:46:47 Yeah, or something.
02:46:50 Next one is stop with all the YouTube links, please.
02:46:53 Yeah, although there haven't been that many.
02:46:55 There's been one.
02:46:56 I mean, if you explain what the video is, it's more likely to be included, right?
02:47:00 Yeah, if you, yeah.
02:47:03 Next one is a social blade link.
02:47:08 I don't know.
02:47:09 User is not found.
02:47:10 So it didn't work.
02:47:11 Thanks.
02:47:12 Thanks, dude.
02:47:12 Okay.
02:47:13 Next one is speakpipe.com slash pcp voicemail.
02:47:18 And yes, that is where you can submit voicemail links.
02:47:22 Okay, good job.
02:47:24 Uh-huh.
02:47:25 Next one is called, okay, good advice.
02:47:28 No, no, good luck.
02:47:29 Thumbs up, adviceanimalsatreddit.com.
02:47:33 Posting right now.
02:47:35 Right.
02:47:35 All right.
02:47:36 Three, two, one, go.
02:47:38 Probably unsolicited advice, but as a person who had to shave his head at 24 years old,
02:47:44 it sucks.
02:47:46 It's fine when you do it like 30 onwards, but at 24 is the worst.
02:47:51 That being said, if you have hair that isn't like being obstructed, like destroyed by really,
02:48:01 really ugly bald spots, I would say keep your hair style better.
02:48:07 For example, there was like this Brazilian guy that like hosted a DND session at a public event
02:48:15 that I went to.
02:48:16 And he was like kind of an early looking guy.
02:48:20 And only after like two or three or four hours of DNDing, I finally noticed he was coming over
02:48:29 a bald spot.
02:48:30 But overall, he looked great.
02:48:32 So sorry for the long voicemail.
02:48:35 But I would advise this mantra, you can do a lot more with hair than you can do without.
02:48:45 Maybe, but like you did notice the bald spot at the end.
02:48:49 The comb over is such a bad look in my eyes.
02:48:55 Bald is just better.
02:48:57 I wonder if this guy's just down on his own look in that way that one is a harsher judge of
02:49:05 oneself than of others.
02:49:08 I did give myself a haircut and I decided afterwards that I was much happier with how
02:49:15 my hair looks now.
02:49:17 I cut it short in the back and the sides and left it longer on top.
02:49:20 And I think that's how I think that's how it looks best.
02:49:23 So I'm back to being like okay with it.
02:49:28 Yeah, so my crisis has been averted.
02:49:30 I feel like if you have the confidence to pull off an exceptionally not acceptable
02:49:42 weird hairstyle, like a fryer tuck where you're bald all over the top but you've got the end
02:49:49 of a bald cut all the way around, if you could pull that off, you would be so cool if you could
02:49:57 do it.
02:49:57 You'd need a lot of confidence.
02:49:59 You'd need to go around in a brown robe and just be a fryer tuck character.
02:50:05 So you're saying the coolest person you could imagine is just a monk.
02:50:10 Well, what I'm saying is going bald happens to a lot of people and people get it.
02:50:16 Like when I see a bald-ing person, I'm not disgusted.
02:50:20 It's just normal.
02:50:21 It's just like lots of people look like that in various stages.
02:50:26 But I feel like there's space to be having a bald spot or a bald-ing thing
02:50:39 and deliberately crafting it and making it look deliberate
02:50:43 with confidence that it could actually look cooler than if you just shaved it all off.
02:50:48 I don't know.
02:50:49 If you do a weird monk look or samurai shave the top of your head thing,
02:50:54 you just look like you're, it just looks like a joke.
02:50:58 It just looks like you're in a costume.
02:50:59 I guess I think jokes are cool.
02:51:03 I think joke people are like epic.
02:51:06 People should wear real clown makeup as normal clothing.
02:51:11 I would look at that and I would say that this guy is like doing a bit.
02:51:16 I wouldn't be like, damn, he's got the confidence to pull off an unconventional look.
02:51:21 I would think he's filming a YouTube video and I'm supposed to be,
02:51:24 and I'm going to be his next victim.
02:51:26 I guess I keep remembering this one guy I met while I'd meet.
02:51:31 I just saw him on the train once and he had like a bright green, like neon green suit
02:51:37 and like a punk hairstyle and he looked like he was like 75.
02:51:41 I'm like, dang, something about the way he's holding himself is like so cool.
02:51:47 I guess he's like an old school punk.
02:51:50 He was like trying to stay like on the edge.
02:51:53 That's pretty cool.
02:51:55 Yeah, I appreciate the punk look.
02:52:01 It's like a true punk.
02:52:02 It's not an aesthetic in and of itself.
02:52:05 I think lifestyle choice to be strange.
02:52:08 I think long hair is more punk, but I just don't think I look very good with my hair long.
02:52:15 So I don't know.
02:52:21 You know, you can't necessarily just pull off any look you want to just because you believe
02:52:29 in yourself hard enough.
02:52:32 Maybe that's not true.
02:52:33 Maybe that's just my doubt.
02:52:34 Maybe that's just my own self-doubt talking.
02:52:35 Yeah, I don't think I could do it.
02:52:37 I feel like I would crumble under pressure and try to like fall into the background
02:52:42 so that people don't look at me.
02:52:44 But I know it's possible because I've seen people do it and I am impressed.
02:52:49 But maybe I'm only impressed because I have shy tendencies.
02:52:55 Who knows?
02:52:58 I'm not particularly bothered by like looking weird in public.
02:53:07 I don't really get embarrassed about that sort of thing.
02:53:11 So I maybe I could do it.
02:53:18 Next one is called, did I skip one?
02:53:24 Yes, next one is called You Dumb Yank.
02:53:28 And there it is.
02:53:30 Three, two, one, go.
02:53:32 Listen here, Ben Shribatsky.
02:53:34 The reason why Shribatsky is the people united will never be defeated.
02:53:39 It's because it's a translation from a Chilean song called El Pueblo Unido Jamacer A Vencido.
02:53:45 It's a literal translation.
02:53:46 It's not a mistake.
02:53:48 The only reason why it's like that is because English is a garbage language.
02:53:53 Sorry.
02:53:54 And the people united will never be divided makes no fucking sense because as Gip said,
02:54:01 it's already implied that they are fucking united.
02:54:04 It doesn't make fucking sense.
02:54:06 Well, what the fuck?
02:54:10 I'm going to defend my statement.
02:54:12 I think that translation involves localization.
02:54:17 And I think that preserving the rhyme would be important.
02:54:21 And I think that no, it makes sense to say once they're united, they will not be divided
02:54:27 because if the goal is to unite, defeat and division are basically one and the same.
02:54:32 Exactly.
02:54:32 So it does make sense.
02:54:34 I think it, thank you.
02:54:35 It makes perfect sense.
02:54:36 You fucking Chilean bastard.
02:54:39 You South American.
02:54:41 Did you say English?
02:54:43 English.
02:54:44 Damn.
02:54:44 I heard that slip.
02:54:48 The people divided will never be multiplied.
02:54:52 Multiplied.
02:54:54 I still prefer Gibbs interpretation.
02:54:56 The people united will never be divided.
02:55:00 Will never be divided.
02:55:02 People will be so scared that they'll just conventionally to every demand.
02:55:07 Next, there's a follow-up called you dumb Yankee part two.
02:55:12 Three.
02:55:13 Actually, there's a part three as well.
02:55:14 This is part two.
02:55:16 Three, two, one, go.
02:55:19 Okay, Ben Zelensky.
02:55:21 I'm sorry, man.
02:55:21 I was a little bit violent just now because I just got my third booster shot.
02:55:28 And I'm fucking, I am in fucking pain right now.
02:55:31 And it's fucking awful.
02:55:34 But I guess it beats breathing through a tube.
02:55:37 That's it.
02:55:39 Get your booster shot.
02:55:41 I did get my booster shot.
02:55:42 Fuck you, Ben.
02:55:43 Yeah, of course.
02:55:44 Yeah, fuck Ben.
02:55:45 We're really good Ben fuckers.
02:55:47 Yeah, I thought for a second he was being kind and that was too far.
02:55:52 I did get my booster shot.
02:55:52 He had to say fuck Ben at the end to balance it out.
02:55:55 I got it.
02:55:56 When did I get it?
02:55:57 Probably in like late January, I think, or something.
02:56:02 So it's been a while.
02:56:04 I would like another one, please.
02:56:08 I'd like a boob or shot, please.
02:56:09 One in each.
02:56:11 Nice.
02:56:13 Nice.
02:56:14 Very good.
02:56:15 There's one.
02:56:16 Okay, next one is part three.
02:56:18 Three, two, one, go.
02:56:21 Okay, I know this is the third voicemail I sent.
02:56:24 I am sorry.
02:56:24 At least they're short.
02:56:25 I'm not going to send any more.
02:56:28 But before I forget, I want to thank Gib because the package arrived.
02:56:33 And I've been laughing like a dumbass to read my comics.
02:56:37 It's really funny.
02:56:38 I have not yet read The Lord of Ghosts.
02:56:41 I'm going to read it.
02:56:42 I have a lot of things to do first, but I will read it.
02:56:46 So thank you for the doodle.
02:56:48 Thank you for what you sent me and that's it.
02:56:53 That's it.
02:56:53 Have a good day.
02:56:54 Well, thank you.
02:56:55 Thank you for buying it.
02:56:57 That guy went through an arc.
02:56:58 He started off a villain and he became a hero.
02:57:01 Based gigachat move reading the Red Man comic first.
02:57:06 That's true.
02:57:07 I suspect that my package from you did arrive.
02:57:11 Something turned up at my mother-in-law's.
02:57:14 We're heading there today to go.
02:57:16 Oh, good.
02:57:17 Oh, I don't think I'm...
02:57:19 I don't know if I mentioned this on the last episode.
02:57:22 I meant to say it.
02:57:23 Oh, this is actually really important.
02:57:25 I wanted to say that I went to my PO box
02:57:27 and I discovered that my PO box had expired.
02:57:31 And so it's possible that some people
02:57:33 who I might have sent a package to and it did not arrive,
02:57:36 it might have been unable to be returned to me
02:57:39 and it was lost.
02:57:40 So I guess anyone listening,
02:57:44 if you have not gotten a package from me,
02:57:46 you should let me know and I will just send you another one
02:57:50 because that's my fault for letting the PO box expire.
02:57:53 Actually, there were like four...
02:57:54 There were like four packages.
02:57:55 I think there were three pleb in the wee Blu-rays
02:57:57 and there was one copy of Road to Radcon.
02:58:01 And these were like old copies.
02:58:02 I had sent them in February.
02:58:04 So anything after February that got returned is gone, I think.
02:58:08 So that's kind of sad.
02:58:09 Hopefully there's not that many.
02:58:12 But I have like four that I have
02:58:13 that I have to contact those people and send them out.
02:58:16 But there's probably some more that are missing.
02:58:18 And I hate to think that anyone bought something from me
02:58:21 and didn't get it.
02:58:23 So I will like...
02:58:25 Those people whose envelopes I do have,
02:58:27 I will try and reach out to them
02:58:28 if I can figure out who they were.
02:58:31 Yeah, that was a bit of bad news that I found today.
02:58:35 But I guess this does mean
02:58:36 that I can now get a new PO box closer to my house,
02:58:41 which is convenient.
02:58:42 That old one was like the other side of town.
02:58:45 It was very annoying.
02:58:47 Oh, yeah.
02:58:48 I guess I should mention briefly.
02:58:51 If anybody's gotten their Lord of Ghost package
02:58:53 but hasn't let me know,
02:58:56 I can't tell when things have arrived
02:58:58 because I didn't have tracking on a lot of these
02:59:00 for money purposes.
02:59:03 So I haven't received any returns.
02:59:06 So I assume most of them did arrive safely.
02:59:10 But if you have a Twitter account, tweet at me.
02:59:14 It's not just base and cool to see that you're enjoying it.
02:59:19 But it's helpful.
02:59:19 So I can just go on my spreadsheet and say,
02:59:22 that one's arrived.
02:59:23 Don't have to worry about that.
02:59:25 And yeah, some of them might be very stuck
02:59:30 and still in transit.
02:59:32 But I can't know right now.
02:59:35 Some of them end up, especially international packages,
02:59:38 sometimes end up getting stuck in shipping limbo
02:59:40 for a disappointingly long amount of time.
02:59:44 So if it hasn't arrived yet
02:59:46 and I haven't received a return,
02:59:48 it's probably on its way very, very slowly.
02:59:52 So that's that, I guess.
02:59:55 Just sorry.
02:59:58 Yeah, there's nothing you can really do about it.
03:00:02 The next voicemail is just a text question.
03:00:05 It says, is Tom still a member?
03:00:09 Yes, but he said he probably won't be on anytime soon.
03:00:14 He says he's busy with the channel
03:00:19 Nintendo 64, what was it called?
03:00:23 Saber Spark.
03:00:23 Yeah, Saber Spark 65.
03:00:25 Yeah, he's working on it.
03:00:27 100,000 subscribers.
03:00:29 Good for him.
03:00:31 Huh?
03:00:31 100,000 subscribers on that.
03:00:33 Good for him.
03:00:34 Good for him.
03:00:35 Good for him.
03:00:36 Good for them.
03:00:38 Vam.
03:00:38 Right.
03:00:39 Snakes.
03:00:41 No.
03:00:41 Good for them.
03:00:42 Snakes.
03:00:42 They've got us surpassed.
03:00:43 Soon enough they'll surpass Nate, just like I did.
03:00:49 True.
03:00:51 Yeah, good for them.
03:00:52 Tom said he's probably not going to be around anytime soon.
03:00:55 But he's not like officially quit or anything,
03:00:58 so that's what that's about.
03:01:01 Next one is called iPod Shuffle
03:01:04 Better Than Any Modern Day Portable Technology.
03:01:10 Let me post that.
03:01:11 Three, two, one, go.
03:01:12 So I've bought an iPod, it's like the MP3 player,
03:01:18 and I wanted to listen to this podcast.
03:01:23 I went to the link in the description,
03:01:25 and the MP3s were very hard to download in bulk.
03:01:30 I could download them individually,
03:01:32 but they're like a massive folder of thousands of hours of content.
03:01:38 So I know maybe I'll put like a zip to each one of them,
03:01:44 more money of like every single episode so far.
03:01:49 That'll be a touchy-poo life.
03:01:53 Okay, does this guy want to download all the PCP episodes?
03:01:58 At once, yeah.
03:01:59 In a zip.
03:02:01 In a zip file?
03:02:04 Well, I mean, I guess,
03:02:06 they're all hosted on Google Drive, right?
03:02:11 They're all downloadable from the PCP website.
03:02:15 Yeah, but not in bulk.
03:02:17 Not in bulk, you would have to download them one at a time,
03:02:19 which is annoying for sure.
03:02:23 Yeah, I mean, you know, it's a fair request.
03:02:25 It would just take some doing.
03:02:27 I would just have to put that together.
03:02:31 I might.
03:02:32 I mean, it's not a completely stupid idea.
03:02:35 Yeah.
03:02:36 Next one is called Happy Birth.
03:02:38 No, wait, no, sorry.
03:02:39 Sorry, I missed this one.
03:02:40 This one is called B321GO.
03:02:45 What kind of pornography do you like?
03:02:47 Sexy.
03:02:49 Yeah, I like it when it's sexy.
03:02:52 Did they say it was B?
03:02:54 It's just it's just the letter B.
03:02:56 The letter B, okay.
03:02:58 I like B porn.
03:03:01 Yeah.
03:03:01 Do you ever see a B woman and she has a big fucking what's it called?
03:03:07 Stinger.
03:03:08 Not the Stinger.
03:03:08 The thorax or no abdomen.
03:03:10 Yeah, the big or the big fuzz.
03:03:16 Wings and teni, mandibles.
03:03:19 There's an artist.
03:03:20 I've seen BOCs or if I give them like the big B but and I don't know what it is,
03:03:25 but it does something for me and it's good.
03:03:29 It's the B dump.
03:03:32 I found some good images, but they're all two NSFW to post.
03:03:37 Yeah, yeah, the abdomen is the big like the big bulgy part underneath the tiny little waist.
03:03:46 Like those giant ants in Elden Ring that I was saying.
03:03:49 I'm sure I can crop this to where it would be safe enough.
03:03:53 It's just two pixels.
03:03:54 I don't think I don't think it's insectoid.
03:03:57 Women really do it for me.
03:04:00 I just want to fuck everything.
03:04:06 Okay, I see where this is going and I get it.
03:04:10 There's a pretty large boob elsewhere on screen.
03:04:13 Obviously, you can't show that.
03:04:14 Yeah, yeah, I can see that.
03:04:16 I don't know if I like the thorax or if I like the sticking out of her butt there.
03:04:24 Little weird.
03:04:25 You grab it and pull it up like a, like a, like a, well,
03:04:30 psycho potatoes, what would it be like?
03:04:33 Like a giant bag of sand.
03:04:36 Like a thing.
03:04:36 Instead of a stinger, there's just another hole to put your penis in.
03:04:40 Ben is not bug fuck.
03:04:42 This is what we're learning today.
03:04:43 Ben is not bug fuck.
03:04:44 I don't think I am.
03:04:45 Yeah, I don't really think I'm much honest.
03:04:47 I mean, when it comes to-
03:04:48 Work's going to be so disappointed in you.
03:04:51 Yeah, she already is, don't worry.
03:04:53 When it comes to art, like this, this is like only tangentially bug.
03:04:59 Like it's basically just a woman.
03:05:02 I mean, yeah.
03:05:04 Yeah, Ben wouldn't, Ben wouldn't fuck tangentially just a woman.
03:05:08 Terrible.
03:05:11 Come on, she's tangentially a woman.
03:05:13 What's, what's the problem?
03:05:17 Next one is called happy birthday Ben.
03:05:20 Oh my God.
03:05:20 And then the next one is, you're not going to believe the next one is called
03:05:23 you wouldn't fuck a bee?
03:05:30 There's, okay, there's, there's an image and an audio.
03:05:33 So I guess let's listen to the audio first.
03:05:35 Three, two, one, go.
03:05:36 I am not a horse.
03:05:38 I am a bee.
03:05:39 I am a funny fucking bee.
03:05:41 Oh yes, I have a big stinger.
03:05:44 Buzz, buzz, buzz.
03:05:46 Celestia, you're off your meds.
03:05:49 What?
03:05:53 She's really going for it.
03:05:54 Uh, there, there, there she is.
03:05:58 You know what?
03:05:58 You know what?
03:05:59 I like this.
03:06:00 You know what?
03:06:00 This is better.
03:06:01 Okay, okay.
03:06:02 But she's a tangential woman.
03:06:03 She's not a real woman, Ben.
03:06:05 Yeah, she's a horse.
03:06:06 I guess I like mammals.
03:06:07 No, no, no abdomen.
03:06:08 No chitin, please.
03:06:11 Mammal is good.
03:06:13 I'm very vanilla.
03:06:14 I only fuck mammals.
03:06:17 That is, uh.
03:06:18 No amphibians, no frog girls.
03:06:20 It's, it's like he knew.
03:06:21 It's like he knew that I would be upset
03:06:24 by his initial question.
03:06:25 And he anticipated my response.
03:06:28 But how did they know we were going to talk about bees?
03:06:31 I don't know.
03:06:35 Next, next one is another Imgir link.
03:06:38 They primed us by putting the letter B
03:06:40 in the voicemail, remember?
03:06:42 That's just a happy coincidence.
03:06:45 Um, okay.
03:06:47 Okay, so this is give Ben Saint.
03:06:51 Okay, it's this.
03:06:53 Yes, you, wait, is this an album?
03:06:56 Yeah, there's a bunch of, there's a bunch of images.
03:06:57 Oh, let me have a look at these.
03:07:00 Flights from England are now landing in Boston.
03:07:03 This is the truth.
03:07:04 This is, there I go.
03:07:06 There I am.
03:07:08 They gave you such a bubble butt.
03:07:11 Oh yeah, a little bit.
03:07:13 But hey, hey guy, no smoking in the airport.
03:07:17 Who me?
03:07:18 Yes, you with the, oh, it's a little cut off.
03:07:21 Yes, you with the smoke.
03:07:23 It's vaping.
03:07:24 It's vape.
03:07:25 I'm vaping, dude.
03:07:27 A man causing trouble just by standing in place,
03:07:29 not doing anything.
03:07:30 It must be none other than Ben Saint.
03:07:34 That's how I find you.
03:07:35 Just vibing.
03:07:36 I like that you got your guitar.
03:07:38 That's nice.
03:07:39 That's a nice detail.
03:07:41 I probably won't bring my guitar.
03:07:42 You have two guitars.
03:07:44 Do I have two guitars?
03:07:46 Well, there's the one on the, you're holding one,
03:07:48 and then there's another one in the baggage claim.
03:07:52 Oh, yeah, why?
03:07:54 What?
03:07:54 Am I dual wielding?
03:07:58 Maybe one's like a ukulele.
03:08:00 Maybe one, maybe it's the two guitars from the Rayman video,
03:08:04 or the hypocritical reviews, where like,
03:08:07 there was the one who talked,
03:08:09 and then there was the other guitar that the guitar played.
03:08:13 Remember that?
03:08:14 I like.
03:08:15 Yes, I do.
03:08:16 I was thinking about that character recently.
03:08:19 I was thinking, wow, hypocrite was a good channel.
03:08:24 Thanks.
03:08:27 I like how they drew my face here.
03:08:29 I think I look very cool.
03:08:32 It's vape.
03:08:32 I'm vaping, dude.
03:08:35 It's not even coming out of my mouth.
03:08:36 It's just seeping out of my skin.
03:08:38 Out of your pores, just like a mist.
03:08:42 Saturated with it.
03:08:44 It's losing out of my, my cloak.
03:08:46 This guy's so pissed.
03:08:48 Oh, he's a cop.
03:08:51 So, you know, of course he's mad.
03:08:53 He's going to go beat his wife.
03:08:55 Lamau.
03:08:58 Thank you.
03:08:58 I love, I love that.
03:08:59 That's very delightful.
03:09:02 Next one is called,
03:09:04 I, Ethan Ralph, am fixing what you did to him, Ben Saints.
03:09:08 Uh, there it is.
03:09:11 Okay.
03:09:11 Three, two, one, go.
03:09:14 Hi, mate.
03:09:15 Last week, I took the baby to the prayer gateway church camp.
03:09:20 I went to when I was a kid.
03:09:23 You know, I probably never told you, but I like dicks a lot.
03:09:29 But now I'm straight, mate.
03:09:31 And so will our baby be.
03:09:33 That's great.
03:09:33 When he's back, he'll be a completely different person.
03:09:37 Just like me, Ethan Ralph senior.
03:09:41 My son, Ethan Ralph junior will be a completely different person
03:09:45 by the time he comes back.
03:09:47 Who we?
03:09:49 Oh, wow.
03:09:50 Who we?
03:09:50 Who we?
03:09:51 Who we?
03:09:53 Wow, wow.
03:09:54 Wow.
03:09:55 Wow, me too.
03:09:56 That's some shit.
03:09:59 Thank God, Ethan Ralph isn't gay.
03:10:00 I couldn't bear to share a demographic with him.
03:10:03 I know.
03:10:04 I'm glad he sort.
03:10:06 He got that sorted out at a young age before it could cause problems.
03:10:10 Now I can.
03:10:11 I don't have to feel bad about shitting all over him.
03:10:14 Absolutely.
03:10:19 What command is that?
03:10:21 Nothing really, nothing really happened in that voicemail.
03:10:24 What happens?
03:10:26 I, setting up the next scene.
03:10:32 It's a, it's a, it's a slow burn.
03:10:35 Next one.
03:10:37 Wow.
03:10:38 Pardon.
03:10:39 Next one is called Hades.
03:10:42 There it is.
03:10:43 Three, two, one.
03:10:44 There's only two left, by the way.
03:10:45 Three, two, one, go.
03:10:48 I started playing Hades, again, during my COVID adventure, which was hard
03:10:55 because the game makes you push a lot of buttons to do a lot of things.
03:11:00 But you, you, you talk to me into trying the gun.
03:11:06 I like the gun.
03:11:10 I think I'm bad though, but how do you pitch?
03:11:16 The gun, I had my first win with the rail, and I think I have the most wins with the rail.
03:11:21 It's not my favorite.
03:11:22 I think my favorite is actually, I really like the bow.
03:11:26 I really like the shields.
03:11:28 I don't know.
03:11:30 The, you fish by, when you see the little sparkling thing in the water,
03:11:35 you just go over to it and press the action button, and then you just pull out your little rod
03:11:40 and you'll fish.
03:11:42 And then when it flashes and makes a big blue sound, that's when you've got to reel it in.
03:11:47 I've never, I've never been too late on a fishing.
03:11:50 I've only ever failed fishing by like getting psyched out and hitting the, the, like,
03:11:55 reel it in button too early.
03:11:59 Damn.
03:12:00 That's it.
03:12:02 I gotta, I'm like so close to like 100%ing.
03:12:04 Hey, I only have like two achievements left, but they're like really tedious.
03:12:08 And I just, I don't know if I have, I freed, I finished the quest line to set Achilles free
03:12:16 and let him go back to see Patroclus.
03:12:19 But I have not played since then, so I have not visited Patroclus so I can see like,
03:12:24 what are they talking about now?
03:12:28 So that's, that's interesting.
03:12:31 Next one, and this might be the last one, unless someone gave us a last minute voicemail.
03:12:37 This one is called, Ben, I will release my manifesto saint.
03:12:41 Oh boy.
03:12:42 Three, two, one, go.
03:12:44 You've got some explaining to do.
03:12:47 Last week, you said you were going to deliver your manifesto last night or yesterday or
03:12:52 something, I don't know.
03:12:55 A young man in New York shot up a black supermarket and released a 100 page manifesto.
03:13:05 Memes?
03:13:06 Was this you, Ben?
03:13:08 Was he acting under your influence?
03:13:11 Jake, I know you didn't do it, baby.
03:13:13 Right, right, right, snake.
03:13:18 Did I say that?
03:13:19 Did I say I was going to release a manifesto?
03:13:21 I don't remember about.
03:13:23 I also don't remember.
03:13:25 I hope I didn't say that.
03:13:27 That's too bad.
03:13:29 No, I didn't know that guy.
03:13:31 No, he, obviously we, obviously we,
03:13:36 no, I don't even want to joke that like we agree on something that's terrible.
03:13:39 No, I don't know.
03:13:40 Fuck that.
03:13:41 Sad, I'm sad thinking about it.
03:13:46 Oh, the guy was, did I, do you remember me last week saying I was going to release my manifesto?
03:13:52 No, I also don't think this guy's making shit up.
03:13:56 I don't think that happened.
03:13:58 I think this guy might be making some shit up.
03:14:00 He was pulling a leg.
03:14:02 He's pulling my leg and I don't appreciate it.
03:14:04 I'm going to, I'm so annoyed that I'm going to burn my bridge with this guy and just call
03:14:08 him out and just say, what a piece of shit.
03:14:10 I hate him.
03:14:10 Not my friend anymore.
03:14:12 Just because this one time that I got mildly angry.
03:14:16 That's what I do.
03:14:18 Yeah.
03:14:19 Damn.
03:14:19 That's it.
03:14:21 That's the last voicemail.
03:14:22 Well, good timing because I think I have to head to the store pretty soon.
03:14:26 So I guess we can wrap up maybe.
03:14:30 Yeah.
03:14:30 Yeah, let's, let's wrap it up.
03:14:32 What are we at?
03:14:32 Like four hours, three, okay, three, three hours and 15.
03:14:37 Okay.
03:14:38 It's respectable.
03:14:41 Yes.
03:14:42 Anyone who didn't get a thing that they ordered from me, let me know it might have
03:14:47 been lost in my canceled PO box.
03:14:49 Please, please let me give you stuff.
03:14:56 That's it.
03:14:58 I guess next week we'll be, I'll be in America.
03:15:02 So I guess we'll record a live PCP.
03:15:05 I don't know.
03:15:06 I don't know if we're going to like film it with like a camera.
03:15:09 We will be in the same room though.
03:15:11 We'll, we'll, we'll do a PCP in the same room or something.
03:15:15 Do you want to do that?
03:15:16 I kind of thought we just maybe wouldn't do one that week.
03:15:19 I mean, we can if you want.
03:15:20 Um, figure, figure something out.
03:15:23 I mean, would it be that hard to like organize just sitting in a room for a couple hours?
03:15:29 No, probably not.
03:15:34 Sounds, sounds doable.
03:15:36 Yeah.
03:15:37 Uh, okay.
03:15:40 Sure.
03:15:40 Why not?
03:15:41 Okay.
03:15:42 Okay.
03:15:42 Okay.
03:15:43 Um, anything else before we
03:15:45 wrap?
