00:00:00 Hey, what's up listeners? It's Ben Saint in the Boomer Radio Show Podcast Pro Crastinators Podcast Soundboard.
00:00:10 It's Ben Saint in the morning.
00:00:13 Announcement, bonus episode, emergency bonus episode. We recorded an emergency bonus episode this week.
00:00:20 If you're interested, there is for Trixie's funny appearance on who are these podcasts where she attempted to dunk on us.
00:00:33 As of right now, I have not listened to it, but me and Simsie and Gibb, if she ever fucking shows up on time, are about to listen to that, record that, and have a live reaction to that.
00:00:47 That will be the bonus episode. It should be up now, when you're listening to this, patreon.com.
00:00:56 If you want to hear our hot takes, my live take on that, and I will give you a live rating, 1-10, of how much my feelings were hurt, and how much I was coping, and how much I was seething.
00:01:12 I will give 1-10 ratings of those three things, and I will chart them as the segment progresses.
00:01:21 Okay, link in the description, patreon.com.
00:01:24 For Crastinators bonus episode, special. Okay, back to the regular episode. Bye.
00:01:32 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:01:46 I had a nightmare last night that I, well, it wasn't really a nightmare, but it was a dream where I recorded the podcast, but then I didn't save it.
00:01:59 I didn't close it without saving it and lose it, but I hit the save button, but I didn't hit the okay on the where to save it, so it didn't actually save.
00:02:09 So I left the audacity file open on my desktop, and I left, and then I realized, oh my god, I didn't actually save it.
00:02:18 It's just open, it still needs to be saved. If anything happens to my computer, the file will disappear.
00:02:25 Oh god, but I'm not at home right now, because I left, and I was like, I gotta get back there. I gotta save the podcast.
00:02:35 Well, if you have enough nightmares, you can put them in a stable.
00:02:41 Oh my god. Oh my god. Yeah, true, true though.
00:02:47 Gotta use your head.
00:02:49 That was a good, that's a pretty, I was watching some, I've been watching a channel that is specifically about Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow and Aria of Sorrow.
00:03:02 The entire channel is about that.
00:03:05 Wait, what?
00:03:06 You mean the whole channel is dedicated to those two games?
00:03:10 Yes, yes.
00:03:14 Wait, hold on. I want to see, what's the name of the channel? I've been watching it a lot. Yeah, he did a countdown of like, he ranked, he did tier list rankings of all the red souls in Dawn, all the red souls in Aria, all the blue souls in Dawn, all the blue souls in Dawn, all the yellow souls in Dawn, all the yellow souls in Aria.
00:03:29 And the nightmare, there's one, I think it's called Nightmare where you shoot a big horse, and that one's apparently pretty good.
00:03:35 That's a high tier soul from Dawn.
00:03:38 Yeah, I seem to remember.
00:03:40 No, Aria.
00:03:41 I remember the big horsey soul.
00:03:45 Wait, hold on. It is a tier list Aria.
00:03:54 I want to give this guy props.
00:03:56 He's got a tiny channel. Yeah, the channel is Jupiter Climb. He's got 1000 subscribers.
00:04:03 He ranked all the weapons. I just really like, I really like Dawn of Sorrow. I really like Aria of Sorrow. So it's just cool.
00:04:10 I haven't played that shit. It's probably great.
00:04:13 You never played those? It is great.
00:04:15 The only Castlevania.
00:04:17 They're the best of the Metroidvania Castlevanias.
00:04:20 The Castlevania I've played is three because I downloaded it on the Wii, eStorm.
00:04:26 That's, those are, three is like before Symphony of the Night.
00:04:30 Yes, yes.
00:04:32 Oh, it makes me so mad. I feel like it's so obvious that it almost doesn't even bear mentioning.
00:04:39 And yet every time I see Dawn of Sorrow and Aria of Sorrow, I can't help but be so upset at the art style change between the two games.
00:04:48 Do you know what I'm talking about?
00:04:50 I don't. Let me look it up.
00:04:53 The, the art, Aria of Sorrow, I think that, yeah, the first one, it has the beautiful like painted art style of, oh, who's the artist who did like Symphony of the Night, Castlevania?
00:05:06 It's an anime. You mean the front cover? No.
00:05:08 Or the backgrounds?
00:05:10 Co, is it Kojima? Is it Ayami Kojima, the guy who did all that?
00:05:14 No, no. Or maybe his last name is Kojima.
00:05:18 I know who you mean. It's the guy, the Castlevania guy.
00:05:22 The only Kojima I know is Hideo Kojima.
00:05:25 It's definitely not him. Symphony of the Night.
00:05:30 The guy who got the, he made a Kickstarter for a different non-Kojima, I mean Castlevania-esque thing that was pretty good, I think.
00:05:37 Koji something. I think his name is Kojima.
00:05:40 Kojikondo.
00:05:42 Not Kojikondo. Yeah, Igarashi, I think.
00:05:46 Oh, okay, no, but I'm talking about the art specifically, which yeah, is apparently this guy Ayami Kojima.
00:05:52 Oh, yeah. I didn't know that.
00:05:54 Anyway, they didn't, I guess they didn't have him for the sequel, Dawn of Sorrow, and so they just kind of look like fucking anime, and it sucks so bad.
00:06:02 Yeah, Dawn of Sorrow had more of an anime look to it.
00:06:06 It's so bad. It's so like, it's so flat and boring compared to the first one.
00:06:11 The front cover, I'm looking at them.
00:06:15 The front cover and the portraits.
00:06:17 Art of Sorrow looks like a Final Fantasy-esque sort of painterly-esque thing, and then Dawn of Sorrow does look like some anime-type tie-in game.
00:06:26 Dawn of Sorrow looks like fucking, it looks like, I mean, no offense, I guess, but it looks like fucking, what do you call it, like Ace Attorney or something.
00:06:35 No, the front covers for Ace Attorney are the worst part, for sure.
00:06:39 But yes, look, look, compare the two front covers, and that's exactly it.
00:06:42 Like all the in-game character portraits are painted like that, and then in Dawn they look like fucking, they look like fucking 90s anime characters.
00:06:50 It sucks.
00:06:52 I don't know, I didn't mind it too much, but I guess it depends on how much you like that kind of anime art style.
00:06:59 If you're a big fan of anime, maybe you would like it.
00:07:02 It's just so much more generic. It's so much more like you would see this kind of art anywhere.
00:07:07 I am looking at an image, oh god, I went to look at the image, it's asking me to download it, fuck off, no, I will grab a screen grab.
00:07:19 This looks a little bit like Fire Emblem characters portraits, which I don't mind, I actually quite like those.
00:07:28 This isn't annoying me too much.
00:07:30 I only don't like it because I think the first one is so much more unique.
00:07:38 I feel like it's a big downgrade.
00:07:40 Maybe Ben is just racist against anime.
00:07:43 That's true.
00:07:45 Putting these together though, I can see, is that the same guy?
00:07:50 Well, that's him at the end of the game when there's just a certain thing going on with him.
00:07:57 He's beast mode.
00:07:59 It's a spoiler.
00:08:04 Oh my god, Dracula's in Castlevania.
00:08:07 The story of Dawn of Sorrow is awesome because every Castlevania is about you're a vampire hunter hunting down Dracula, and in this one you're just a guy.
00:08:18 First of all, it's in the future for some reason.
00:08:20 It doesn't really even matter that it's in the future, it just is.
00:08:23 You're just some kid who wanders into the castle who gets trapped there.
00:08:29 But it turns out in the end that you were called there because you are Dracula reincarnated.
00:08:36 And then you have to resist your fucking fate to stop yourself from becoming Dracula.
00:08:42 It's awesome.
00:08:44 I think there's a secret ending in one of the games where you do actually become Dracula and you get killed by the other characters.
00:08:52 Before you fight them, it's one of the other...
00:08:57 It's Julius Belmont, I think.
00:09:02 Yes.
00:09:04 If you go down to the secret ending mode, you fight Julius Belmont, and he's a tough boss.
00:09:11 And you don't kill him though, and you tell him, like, I'm gonna go stop myself from becoming Dracula.
00:09:17 If I don't do it, I want you to kill me.
00:09:19 And then if you go and you get the bad ending, it's the scene from the beginning where Dracula is sitting on the throne and he has a miserable pile of secrets and he throws the wine glass.
00:09:30 And then, yeah, you get that scene, but it's you.
00:09:34 You're sitting on the throne and you throw the glass, and Julius shows up and he's like, I'm here to keep that promise I made for you.
00:09:40 Oh yeah, oh yeah, what a video game.
00:09:42 Yeah, that was pretty cool, I remember that.
00:09:45 So good, yeah.
00:09:48 But you know, since we're on the subject of Metroidvania, shouldn't we talk about the new one, Metroid Dread?
00:09:59 I haven't played it.
00:10:02 I don't have a Switch, I haven't played it.
00:10:05 Everyone seems to be really liking it.
00:10:08 Well, it's too bad Tom isn't here because I think he has played it, right?
00:10:13 Yes, I think I just tweeted about it.
00:10:18 Well, I kind of got it a bit later than everyone else because that issues with my order, but I beat it recently.
00:10:26 I beat it once on normal mode, and I got a playtime of like three hours and 50 minutes, which is pretty good.
00:10:35 And then I beat it again on hard mode following one of those sequels.
00:10:39 But you beat the whole game in three hours?
00:10:41 Well, it's not, that's the in-game timer.
00:10:44 It actually took me longer than that, but the game doesn't count on you.
00:10:48 Is it because you died over and over?
00:10:51 Yeah, I died a lot and it doesn't count your death.
00:10:54 Fair enough, I guess.
00:10:56 So it took longer than that, but that's like an accelerated speedrun time.
00:11:02 So when I beat it on hard mode, I was following one of the sequence breaking guides,
00:11:07 and I managed to get the playtime to like two hours and 40 minutes, which is, you know, not bad for a normal non-speedrunner.
00:11:17 That seems so short though. It seems like a really short game.
00:11:21 Well, normally it would take you around like 10 hours probably to beat it.
00:11:26 Yeah, that's what I would expect for a casual play.
00:11:31 But you know, most Metroid games can be beaten in under two hours speedrun time.
00:11:37 Well, yeah, but I mean you, but it was your first play, so it's not like you're using speedrun strats.
00:11:43 Well, I did the second time around when I played on hard mode.
00:11:47 The first time I just went real fast. I got lucky on the first time.
00:11:50 I only just barely made it under four hours, which is what you need to do to unlock, you know, all the artwork and stuff.
00:11:57 But anyways, CC says he wants to talk about Castlevania, should we let him in?
00:12:04 I don't know, that's your call.
00:12:07 I got nothing to say about castles and vanias.
00:12:11 But I don't mind, I guess.
00:12:13 I've gushed enough. I've gushed enough. Nah.
00:12:17 I just figured we should die.
00:12:22 I figured we should talk about Metroid Dread so you can put it in a thumbnail and in the title.
00:12:28 Oh, yeah.
00:12:29 Get all those SEO points.
00:12:31 That's pretty good.
00:12:32 Dude, Metroid Dread, two dimensions.
00:12:34 I played Metroid though. I can talk about Metroid, not Dread.
00:12:38 That's the clickbait.
00:12:40 I can talk about Zero Mission and Fusion. Those are my ones.
00:12:45 Zero Mission is the remake of the original one, right?
00:12:48 Yeah.
00:12:49 The first one I ever played was Fusion on the GBA, and then I played a GBA port of Super at some point.
00:12:59 I think those are the only two I've played, but they're cool.
00:13:02 There is no GBA port of Super. I think you're thinking of Zero Mission.
00:13:07 Maybe I played it on an emulator. No, I've definitely played Super Metroid.
00:13:14 That's the big one.
00:13:16 Everyone says it's the best one or the most iconic, and I still haven't gone around to it.
00:13:22 I like Metroid and Zero Mission and Fusion though a lot, so I probably would like it.
00:13:27 Super Metroid is my favorite, but I think my second favorite probably is Zero Mission.
00:13:35 Zero Mission is, even though it's a remake of the first Metroid, it's a lot like Super Metroid.
00:13:41 It takes a lot of inspiration. A lot of the upgrades and bosses and stuff are taken directly from Super Metroid.
00:13:52 Yeah, it's such a cryptic game for trying to figure out some of these things.
00:14:01 There's that one bug that's blocking your way from one angle, and it's got a really weird creepy music.
00:14:10 You have to go all the way around to the other side of it, and then it's just like the chrysalis is left,
00:14:16 and you walk through it, and then that is turned into a bus.
00:14:19 Yeah, I remember that.
00:14:21 That's something they added in the remake that's not in any other game.
00:14:25 Yeah, it's really hard to...
00:14:30 I was quite young when I played Zero Mission.
00:14:33 It was one of those video games that actually does justice to the wonder and exploration mind of a child sort of thing.
00:14:45 I wonder if you could go there. I wonder if you could do this and that.
00:14:48 I wonder if you bounce on explosions, one of the bomb balls.
00:14:53 Yeah, the bomb jump.
00:14:55 Yeah, the morph jump ball jumping.
00:14:58 What if you could jump all the way on the surface of the planet up to a ledge, and you could?
00:15:03 And I got up there, and I'm like, fuck yeah.
00:15:07 There's so many places where you can do that.
00:15:10 That's basically what Metroid is all about, and Super Metroid kind of does that even better,
00:15:15 because in Zero Mission it tells you where to go, but Super Metroid doesn't tell you where to go at all.
00:15:21 Well, I was so confused playing Zero Mission, I had no idea where I was going at any point.
00:15:26 I was too stupid to understand when there was a cutscene, that there was a way to get there.
00:15:33 It's just sort of like you go to a chozo, you get an upgrade, and then it goes...
00:15:39 and then it shows your map.
00:15:41 It goes...
00:15:45 and then a funny little orange marker on the map.
00:15:49 And they mark on your map.
00:15:51 But I didn't even have the map, so it was just like a dot off in the distance.
00:15:55 I'm like, how do I go that way?
00:15:57 Yeah, Zero Mission, it was a...
00:15:59 I explore the entire world over and over again every time, because I kept not finding the right way to go.
00:16:04 It was great.
00:16:05 Zero Mission, it had a pretty good balance between not giving you too much information about where to go,
00:16:10 but it does give you at least a little nudge with that little icon.
00:16:14 So you still have to figure it out on your own mostly, but you at least have some sense of direction and where to go.
00:16:22 Because in Super Metroid and Metroid 1 and 2, you had no indication whatsoever.
00:16:27 You just had to randomly search the map and figure out where to go.
00:16:32 You just sort of run up against a wall.
00:16:34 You run around until you can't run around anymore, and you're like, how do I do this?
00:16:38 And then you try and figure out how to do that.
00:16:41 Right.
00:16:42 But what I like about Super Metroid is that even though it never tells you where to go with icons and stuff,
00:16:47 the level design kind of has a lot of direction to it.
00:16:51 So as long as you follow the basic philosophy of, if I haven't been somewhere, I should probably go there,
00:16:58 you will almost always find a way forward.
00:17:02 There's a couple of exceptions to that, but that general strategy,
00:17:07 it pretty much always works.
00:17:09 It kind of funnels you into where you need to go just through the natural geometry of the world.
00:17:15 And I think that's pretty cool.
00:17:18 You know how I was playing for a little time?
00:17:24 I said I was going to play a bunch of NES games or franchises from the beginning.
00:17:30 So I beat Mario 1, and I sort of stopped doing it at Mario 2, but I want to do that.
00:17:35 And then Mario 3.
00:17:37 I also want to do that for Zelda and Metroid as well.
00:17:40 I could maybe play Super Metroid on stream at some point,
00:17:44 and then mute the comments because people tell me where to go,
00:17:48 and everyone would be seething and coping about how bad I am.
00:17:52 And that would be fun.
00:17:54 I would definitely watch that stream.
00:17:57 I'm a big fan of watching people play games that I grew up with, but it's their first time.
00:18:05 I think I mentioned that before.
00:18:07 For some reason, I get a lot of satisfaction out of that.
00:18:11 I guess it's just because I've beaten these games so many times that I don't remember what it's like to experience it for the first time.
00:18:21 So whenever I get the opportunity to see somebody else experience it for the first time, I'm always pretty excited about that.
00:18:28 Yeah, it's like vicariously getting something that is impossible to get yourself.
00:18:34 Even if it's been a long time, you'll eventually remember parts of it, and you're like, oh yeah, I get it.
00:18:41 I remember this.
00:18:43 They play a game you've played before, and they walk past something, and then they stop and stare and be like, whoa, what the hell?
00:18:51 They're surprised at something, and you have gotten so used to it that you didn't even register it.
00:18:56 You've forgotten it was there. You've forgotten it was funny or interesting.
00:19:01 Yeah, sometimes I'll be reminded of when I first played a game and the kinds of mistakes I used to make when I see somebody else have trouble with the same areas.
00:19:13 So that's pretty interesting. At least I find it interesting.
00:19:21 What game are we talking about? Which Metroid?
00:19:25 Well, I was going to ask, with regards to Metroid Dread, how does it feel similar or different to Zero Mission?
00:19:34 Because that's the one I know.
00:19:36 Well, it's definitely pretty similar.
00:19:38 It's a lot more similar to Zero Mission in Metroid Fusion than Super Metroid, as far as the controls and the design and stuff.
00:19:48 But it's probably the most similar to Samus Returns on the 3DS, because I think it uses either the same engine or a similar engine to that one.
00:19:58 That one had the free aim mechanic where you hold down one of the shoulder buttons, and you can aim in 360 degrees pretty smoothly.
00:20:09 I think probably one of the big differences between Metroid Zero Mission and Fusion compared to Super Metroid is the bosses.
00:20:19 Because in Fusion and Zero Mission, the bosses are kind of hard. They're pretty dang hard.
00:20:27 In Metroid Dread, the bosses are also pretty difficult.
00:20:34 They're strangely dark souls-esque, not just because they're hard, but because you fight a lot of dudes, night dudes or night guys.
00:20:44 Just big, all-king guys in armor with a spear and stuff.
00:20:50 You fight a lot of that for some reason in Metroid Dread.
00:20:54 If you like that kind of boss fights, you'll probably like this as well.
00:20:59 I really enjoyed boss fights personally in Metroid Dread. It was a lot of fun.
00:21:05 They're very hard. You die a lot, but they have really cool attack patterns to learn.
00:21:12 Every single attack has a tell.
00:21:15 Every time you know the tells, you can predict what attacks they're going to do before they do it.
00:21:21 It's really satisfying to just get a no-damage kill on a boss that killed you 50 times because you completely figured out his attack pattern.
00:21:32 There's also the counters, the melee counter.
00:21:37 Every once in a while, the boss will flash yellow.
00:21:41 If you do a melee counter, that mechanic is from Samus Returns.
00:21:46 If you do a melee counter when he flashes yellow, it triggers a really cinematic animation where you just unload all your missiles into the boss and do massive damage.
00:21:58 That's extremely satisfying to pull off.
00:22:04 True, though. I assume.
00:22:08 As far as exploration is concerned, it's pretty much like any other Metroid from Super Metroid, Zero Mission and Fusion.
00:22:20 It has a pretty massive map and there's a billion upgrades to collect.
00:22:28 You know those Shine Spark puzzles from Metroid Fusion? I think Zero Mission also had them. There's a lot of that here as well.
00:22:40 Did you ever do any of those Shine Spark puzzles?
00:22:44 I got it. I got my baby bells. I'm good now. I got them.
00:22:50 What flavor?
00:22:52 It's regular.
00:22:53 Oh, fucking pathetic.
00:22:55 I know.
00:22:57 A Metroid flavor?
00:23:00 A Metroid flavor. You put it on your head and it sucks your life force out.
00:23:04 There is Metroid flavored cheese just for you.
00:23:09 The plot to Metroid Red, which I'm not going to talk about because it's a spoiler, but it's kind of weird.
00:23:17 It gets kind of shown in towards the end.
00:23:22 I heard it in very minimal storytelling. There's not cutscenes and stuff in it.
00:23:27 For the most part, there's very few cutscenes. The story is kind of done in Fusion where you go to the computer room and you talk to Adam.
00:23:37 Adam the computer and he just tells you what's going on for the most part.
00:23:42 But Adam doesn't talk as much here as he does in Fusion.
00:23:47 For most of the game, there's no real cutscenes. But then, all of a sudden, in the middle of the game, there's a giant 10 minute cutscene that basically explains everything.
00:24:00 The very end just feels really shown in to me because the main villain is all like, oh, I let you live, Samus, because I wanted to see you reach your true potential.
00:24:19 I wanted to see how strong you'd get.
00:24:22 Is it for Chozo Dad?
00:24:25 Yeah, that's basically...
00:24:27 Abusive Chozo Dad. Samus, you're supposed to be a bird, idiot.
00:24:32 Yeah, basically.
00:24:35 Works for me. The Metroid game is about collecting shit and getting super powerful, so it seems automatically appropriate.
00:24:47 In some ways, I kind of like it because I sometimes like the cheesy, shonen tropes, but at the same time, it also feels kind of lame that this is what all Metroid has resulted in.
00:25:03 It just resulted in cheesy, shonen tropes.
00:25:08 They just reinvented anime.
00:25:11 I was kind of expecting something different because the previous Metroids didn't do that for the most part.
00:25:23 To see this is a big, massive revelation at the end, it's kind of weird.
00:25:32 The boss fight, the final boss is really cool, so it kind of works.
00:25:40 It's interesting because I don't think of Metroid.
00:25:45 There's a lot of world building and aliens and things you can study up on, but I think of Metroid Zero Mission and I think, I gotta blast those aliens.
00:25:54 I gotta jump and I gotta morph ball.
00:25:59 It's not a thinking series, not that a heady Metroid thing is bad or whatever, but when I think of the plot of Metroid, it's usually just go to a planet, do your job, and then get out of there before it blows.
00:26:17 It's like an 80s action movie plot of a video game.
00:26:22 That is for the most part accurate.
00:26:26 It was really only Metroid Fusion that started to step up the storytelling a lot, but all the previous ones barely had any cutscenes and Zero Mission since it's a remake of Metroid One.
00:26:37 That's why it has almost no story in it because that's what Metroid One was like.
00:26:43 They're mostly just side-scrolling action exploration games.
00:26:48 The story is pretty secondary to the game.
00:26:52 It's mostly just lore. There's a lot of lore, but there's not a whole lot of plots.
00:26:56 There's a lot of lore, but it's like lore that I don't feel curious to learn about.
00:27:01 I know that there's space pirates with Ridley.
00:27:04 I don't really care what they're being space pirates about or where they're from or what the state of the galaxy is in.
00:27:12 Who does Samus work for? Do they work for anyone?
00:27:15 I don't really feel curious about these things, even though there might be cool tidbits of information.
00:27:20 In Metroid Prime you can scan everything, and I'm like, yeah, but I don't actually care about anything.
00:27:26 I just want to shoot.
00:27:28 But it's weird because in other sci-fi universes I would like to know a lot more.
00:27:34 I don't really care about the scan information in Metroid Prime.
00:27:38 I think most of that is just fluff.
00:27:42 The writers had to earn their paychecks, so they just had to put together as many words as they can and increase those word counts.
00:27:51 But I think the lore of the series is something you would only care about if you played all the games and you're a hardcore fan.
00:28:00 If you're not that big of a fan, it's like Zelda.
00:28:06 The Zelda games don't have big plots either, and you'd only care about the Zelda timeline if you've played all the games and you're a big hardcore Zelda fanatic.
00:28:18 I don't know.
00:28:20 I feel like I do care, or I am interested in the Zelda timeline, probably just because it was an interesting infographic when I first saw it.
00:28:28 I was like, oh, what do you know?
00:28:31 They're linked to the past.
00:28:36 And the future.
00:28:38 Am I right? Hell yeah.
00:28:40 Cool.
00:28:42 If there was a map of all the planets in Zelda, Ella, Ratchet and Clank or something, I was like, oh, look at all those planets.
00:28:50 Well, what about?
00:28:54 Screw Attack.
00:28:56 I think the bottom line of Metroid Red is that if you like Metroid, you're probably going to like Metroid Red.
00:29:04 I probably will.
00:29:06 I'll steal it.
00:29:08 It's more of what you like about Metroid, basically.
00:29:13 Well, that's good.
00:29:15 But I felt like a lot of the bosses took a lot of inspiration from Mega Man, because most of the bosses are like one-on-one fights with a dude, as opposed to a giant monster or alien.
00:29:28 And there were a lot of mechanics added in this game that felt like Mega Man, like there's a slide move, a Mega Man style slide.
00:29:37 And then there's also like, there's something that's kind of like the dash move from Mega Man X and the air dash.
00:29:45 Those mechanics, they really make the bosses way more enjoyable.
00:29:52 Because you can kind of air dash over the bosses to avoid their attacks and stuff.
00:29:59 Wait, it's on the switch. I don't have a switch. I couldn't even play it if I wanted to. Damn.
00:30:04 You could steal it.
00:30:06 There are switch emulators.
00:30:08 Yeah, I heard there's an emulator actually that fully plays Metroid Dread, I think.
00:30:18 Really? Seriously?
00:30:21 Yeah, I read that in an article somewhere.
00:30:24 The switch emulator has been around for a while. My brother was like, oh, like he googled it one time and it just came up and it was easy to use to play switch games.
00:30:35 I think there's two major emulators that run Dread. One partially runs it and the other one runs it all the way. I guess it's fully playable, I think.
00:30:47 But I haven't tried it, so I don't actually know from firsthand experience how well it works.
00:30:54 My hands are clean.
00:30:56 Yeah, my hands are clean because I washed them.
00:31:01 Same.
00:31:03 I should stop. I shouldn't look at Twitter. I shouldn't look at Twitter.
00:31:06 Ben, don't be Twittering right now.
00:31:08 Oh yeah, that reminds me of something else I wanted to bring up.
00:31:14 So Riley challenged you to like a boxing match or something?
00:31:19 Oh god, we're going to talk about that. Yeah, he said he wanted to punch me or something.
00:31:26 It's kind of funny because at one moment it seemed like you two were working together to conspire against the May break-in story.
00:31:36 Yeah, I don't know.
00:31:38 And now you're like at odds with each other again?
00:31:42 No, it was the other way.
00:31:45 What did he say?
00:31:48 I don't know. He posted some shit on a YouTube comment that was like Ben just doesn't like Trixie because he's jealous because he wants her back but we've got her now.
00:32:00 And I'm like, okay, that's wrong. That's a lie. You're lying about me.
00:32:04 And he was upset. He was mad that I said he was lying about me.
00:32:08 And he said I'm going to punch you and he kept posting gifs of people being punched to illustrate what he intended to do to me.
00:32:18 And then the May thing came up and suddenly he's like, he completely switches to and suddenly he's like, oh yeah, you know, Ben, you know, Ben, you know, me and Ben are both just real genuine guys.
00:32:28 You know, we had our differences but you know, it's like, okay.
00:32:32 So you've fallen to a temporary truce?
00:32:36 I didn't. Nobody did. I don't know. That's just what happened. That's just what happened and it's pretty funny.
00:32:48 Yeah, I just rolled with it because I thought it was funny.
00:32:52 That was pretty much the end of the conversation. We exchanged one or two things about how the break-in story sounded kind of fishy.
00:33:02 Yeah, Riley says it's like fake and made up. I don't know if he says it may lie about it.
00:33:10 I don't know if I trust him but I don't really trust her either so I don't know what to think about it.
00:33:16 Oh yeah, that's the thing. He's pretty untrustworthy but...
00:33:20 I would say so, you know.
00:33:22 I think so, yeah.
00:33:24 You can't really take anything he says seriously.
00:33:26 It's not really.
00:33:28 Oh yeah, Trixie wrote that sub-stack article this week where she, in so many words, basically says that it's transphobia that I don't like her anymore and that's it.
00:33:44 So that's funny.
00:33:46 That was only a matter of time.
00:33:48 Yeah, pretty shitty thing to do.
00:33:50 Clearly dishonest. Clearly a misrepresentation of it but it's convenient to believe it so I guess it's sure.
00:33:58 Why not?
00:34:00 Why not?
00:34:02 She gives a list.
00:34:04 She says, I don't experience transphobia in the real world.
00:34:08 I only experience transphobia in very specific circumstances and then she gives a list of circumstances.
00:34:16 And one of the things on the list is like people, someone that used to be close to me, you know, encouraging my patrons to not be patrons anymore.
00:34:26 One of the things on the list is Ben St.
00:34:32 You know, I don't experience transphobia in the real world but I do experience it through Ben St.
00:34:38 Through Ben St. specifically?
00:34:40 Yes, Ben St. of Boston, America. This is his telephone number.
00:34:44 Ben, you're trying to ruin the careers, the livelihoods of a trans creator.
00:34:52 I mean, what the fuck?
00:34:54 That's literally what I'm doing and I don't feel good about it.
00:34:58 It's a good point.
00:35:00 I feel heroic for doing so.
00:35:02 Who made me mad? Who made me mad to see that?
00:35:06 I saw a short clip on, it's part of a longer video, but I saw a short part of it where Trixie, somebody asks Trixie what you would have to do in order for her to forgive you.
00:35:24 Yes, and she said she would only forgive you if you commit harakiri, is that how you say it?
00:35:30 Harakiri, yes.
00:35:32 She said harakiri but the yigs didn't know what that meant so she amended it to seppuku.
00:35:40 And they knew what that meant?
00:35:44 Yeah.
00:35:45 I think that's more of a well-known term.
00:35:47 I think so, I think so.
00:35:49 She wants you to commit sodoku.
00:35:52 That's probably why, it's because of the memeability of seppuku.
00:35:58 Oh, I remember, I learned the word seppuku from that one kid's show.
00:36:07 It's called Mystic Ninja, I think it's called, but it's like the kid's show with the little goofy ninja.
00:36:13 One of the bad guys is a guy named seppuku maru who, his whole thing is just that he commits suicide and he cuts his guts open and kills himself.
00:36:23 That's a weird thing to be in a kid's show.
00:36:25 It is, but it's true.
00:36:27 Wait, let me show you seppuku maru.
00:36:30 Seppuku maru?
00:36:32 No, okay.
00:36:36 If you've never seen this before, I mean it's real.
00:36:41 Wait, I'm in the wrong server.
00:36:43 Make sure your seats are belted.
00:36:46 Yeah, this guy, he's like the evil henchman guy and he's just always like, oh, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna seppuku myself this time.
00:36:54 He's so confident and cocky looking with his knife dangling.
00:36:59 This looks really familiar to me.
00:37:01 He loves disemboweling himself.
00:37:03 It's from Goemon.
00:37:05 He's got a one ton thing around his wrist.
00:37:08 Oh, one ton wrist weight, I didn't even notice that.
00:37:11 Yeah, I think it's called Mystic Ninja in the English dub.
00:37:15 Yeah, Goemon.
00:37:17 He commits seppuku in 10 times Earth gravity.
00:37:21 Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's in one of the games because I played all the Goemon games.
00:37:28 I used to be a big fan of the series.
00:37:31 I didn't know there was an anime.
00:37:33 You said this is from an anime?
00:37:35 Yeah, Goemon, wait, Ganbare Goemon is the show, I think?
00:37:45 Was there a video game about this guy?
00:37:50 If he was a boss, he would win instantly.
00:37:53 I feel like I might have played a Super Nintendo game about the same old Ninja man.
00:37:59 Yeah, he's from one of the Super Nintendo games I think that never came out in the US.
00:38:05 I can't remember which one though.
00:38:07 Hold on, hold on.
00:38:09 NES game, there's a...
00:38:12 This game, this fucking game right here.
00:38:17 I remember renting this game from Blockbuster, Blockbuster Video, and thinking it was cool,
00:38:25 but not really understanding how to play it and progress in it.
00:38:30 Oh, Game Grumps played that, I think.
00:38:33 I think they did, I think they did.
00:38:35 Yeah, I played this briefly, I never beat it, but this is one of the early Goemon games.
00:38:41 Okay, well I don't remember Sepakumaru from this game, but he doesn't even look like the same character, barely.
00:38:51 There were a lot of the Super Nintendo games.
00:38:56 There's like four or five Super Nintendo Goemon games, most of which did not come out here,
00:39:03 but I beat them all in the early 2000s when I first discovered Emulation,
00:39:09 and I'm pretty sure he's in one of the games, I think, because he looks really familiar to me.
00:39:15 Well fuck, okay, I typed in Goemon and Google, and I did see the kid, but I first got Ishiwaka Goemon,
00:39:23 a legendary Japanese outlaw hero who stole gold and other valuables to give to the poor.
00:39:29 He and his son were boiled alive in public after their failed assassination attempt
00:39:33 on the Sengoku period warlord Totoyomi Hideyoshi.
00:39:37 This is a cool guy, he's got a whole Wikipedia.
00:39:40 You mean you don't know about the legend of Goemon?
00:39:43 Yeah, Goemon is based on a real person.
00:39:46 I don't know nothing.
00:39:47 I knew that it was based on a legend or something, I didn't know it was a real person.
00:39:55 That's neat, I guess.
00:39:57 He's like Robin Hood?
00:39:58 I think it's like Japanese Robin Hood.
00:40:00 The whole live thing reminds me of what happened to spoilers in One Piece.
00:40:07 Oh, I don't even know what you're talking about.
00:40:11 I think Goemon is based on a real person, but there's probably a lot of myths and legends surrounding him as well.
00:40:18 Of course, I mean, outlaw heroes are cool, everyone has them.
00:40:24 He's Robin Hood?
00:40:25 Yeah, he said fuck the police.
00:40:28 Goemon says fuck the police.
00:40:31 And he's right to say that.
00:40:32 You do get attacked by cops all the time, you know, from that period, whatever the response.
00:40:42 Yes.
00:40:43 The guards.
00:40:44 Samurai.
00:40:46 No, I don't think so.
00:40:48 No, okay.
00:40:50 Right.
00:40:51 Yeah, I couldn't beat it.
00:40:52 I didn't understand.
00:40:54 I was too stupid.
00:40:55 I didn't know how video games worked.
00:40:58 You should have played Mystical Ninja for the Super Nintendo and also the N64.
00:41:03 Those were pretty good Goemon games.
00:41:06 Well, I'm sorry.
00:41:08 I'm sorry, I didn't.
00:41:10 They didn't call them Goemon.
00:41:12 When they brought them here, they didn't call them Goemon at first.
00:41:15 They just called them Mystical Ninja.
00:41:17 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:41:19 Which that title doesn't mean anything.
00:41:22 No.
00:41:23 Neither does Goemon.
00:41:24 Because he's not even a ninja.
00:41:27 Is he not a ninja?
00:41:29 He's just a guy, I guess.
00:41:32 Yeah, I suppose so.
00:41:33 A guy with a sword.
00:41:35 He sort of has a...
00:41:37 I guess, yeah, he's not really a ninja.
00:41:40 He holds like a pipe.
00:41:41 He has a fucking pipe that he smokes weed out of, and that's his thing.
00:41:46 In the games, he uses a pipe as a weapon.
00:41:49 What's even funnier is that he gets a chain pipe later on that he can use as a hookshot or something.
00:41:56 A what pipe?
00:41:57 A chain pipe.
00:41:58 A chain pipe with a chain.
00:42:00 It becomes like a long-range melee weapon in the N64 game.
00:42:06 Dude, like Castlevania, the whip.
00:42:09 Yeah, exactly, it's like a whip.
00:42:11 Is it King of Fighters?
00:42:13 No, it's Soul Calibur that the IV has the chain sword.
00:42:18 Yeah, there's a chain sword in Dawn of Sorrow, too.
00:42:21 Ah, Bog.
00:42:23 Ah, video game.
00:42:25 Fire Emblem, there's a...
00:42:27 Souls, you get the lightning puppet soul, lightning bolts.
00:42:32 And an axe with a chain on it.
00:42:34 You make the red minotaur, you make the big axe that goes around the whole screen.
00:42:39 A chain sword sounds cool, but I don't know if it would be really practical.
00:42:43 It seems kind of pointless.
00:42:45 I feel like...
00:42:47 Well, they had one in...
00:42:50 What's that video game?
00:42:52 Bloodborne.
00:42:54 So, I guess it would be useful.
00:42:58 You mean the cane sword?
00:43:00 Oh, right, it was a cane sword.
00:43:02 Yeah, it wasn't a sword, it was a cane.
00:43:07 No, it would probably not work in real life, I think, in my opinion.
00:43:13 I feel like the Go Amon series is pretty underrated.
00:43:18 More people should check out those games.
00:43:20 Well, I don't know a damn thing about it, so I guess you're right.
00:43:24 Actually, most of the Super Famicom games have recently been translated,
00:43:28 so if you are into emulation, you can play them now in English.
00:43:32 There's like four of them, I think.
00:43:35 Wow.
00:43:36 So, I would recommend that.
00:43:38 When I beat those games back in the day, there were no translations,
00:43:42 so I had to beat them in Japanese,
00:43:44 and it definitely hindered the experience a bit,
00:43:48 because those games do have some funny dialogue.
00:43:53 Yes, good.
00:43:56 I remember one of the bosses of the Super Nintendo games
00:44:00 is a guy who's obsessed with sports,
00:44:02 and all the enemies are themed after baseball and stuff.
00:44:07 An evil athlete by the name of Seppuku Maru
00:44:10 has been tearing my home apart.
00:44:12 That's where he's from, actually.
00:44:14 That's from Super Go Amon 4, I think,
00:44:17 or, you know, Go Amon 4, whatever it's called.
00:44:21 Sure.
00:44:24 So, that's why I recognize this guy,
00:44:26 because I beat this game that this screenshot is from...
00:44:30 Excellent.
00:44:32 Whoever is editing this should put this in the episode, this image.
00:44:39 Eleazar.
00:44:41 Yes, that is correct.
00:44:42 Get on it. Get on it.
00:44:44 Cool.
00:44:46 Speaking of Japan, period.
00:44:49 Yes!
00:44:51 I've been getting into...
00:44:53 In order to get away from re-watching Red Letter Media
00:44:57 for the 70th time in my off hours,
00:45:01 when I'm just not really... I don't need to do anything.
00:45:04 I've been trying to get some anime into my veins.
00:45:09 Oh, no!
00:45:11 No, but it's good.
00:45:13 I was recommending Legend of the Galactic Heroes
00:45:15 to some people yesterday.
00:45:17 Yeah, I think I tried to watch that.
00:45:19 It was boring, though.
00:45:21 Oh, jeez.
00:45:22 Well, all right.
00:45:23 Maybe it was something else.
00:45:24 But I watched some classic stuff,
00:45:26 because, you know, the past is cool.
00:45:29 All good, you know.
00:45:31 Yeah, a lot of cool stuff happened back then.
00:45:33 Yeah, I can always agree with that.
00:45:35 I saw a fucking Gauche, the cellist, the sealist.
00:45:41 How do you say celloist?
00:45:43 Cellist.
00:45:44 Cellist. Gauche, the cellist.
00:45:46 That was pretty cool.
00:45:48 And then Panda Copanda, which I love.
00:45:52 It's a cute little Totoro-esque Miyazaki film, pre-Ghibli.
00:45:57 Oh, yeah.
00:45:59 I saw your drawing.
00:46:01 Yeah, and I note that, because it was so good.
00:46:05 My art is so incredible and impressive
00:46:09 that people had no idea that I drew it.
00:46:11 They thought it was promotional material,
00:46:13 and I feel pretty cool about that.
00:46:15 Everyone was fooled.
00:46:17 Yeah, I mean, it did.
00:46:19 It looked like you didn't draw it.
00:46:21 It was too on-model.
00:46:23 Yeah, I saw that.
00:46:25 That was pretty nice.
00:46:27 Yeah.
00:46:29 Panda Copanda.
00:46:31 That's a good one.
00:46:33 Hang on, I got a list.
00:46:35 I got a list of stuff.
00:46:37 I watched the Inferno Cop, that was cool.
00:46:43 That was a cool little one.
00:46:45 That sounds cool.
00:46:47 It's a web series where it's barely any animation.
00:46:51 Was it a trigger thing?
00:46:53 I can't remember.
00:46:55 I liked it, though.
00:46:57 Hey, anime.
00:46:59 Japanese colloquialism.
00:47:01 It's true, though.
00:47:03 A couple of years ago,
00:47:05 I watched, for the first time,
00:47:07 I watched Yu Yu Hakushu.
00:47:11 That's so enormous to watch.
00:47:13 I liked Yu Yu Hakushu as a kid.
00:47:15 I never finished it.
00:47:17 I feel like they never aired the end of it
00:47:19 on Cartoon Network or wherever I was watching it.
00:47:21 I never saw the end.
00:47:23 It was good, though.
00:47:25 A good program.
00:47:27 I first found out about it
00:47:29 because I kind of got into a lot of
00:47:31 emulation in the early 2000s.
00:47:33 I randomly downloaded
00:47:35 Yu Yu Hakushu Super Famicom ROM
00:47:37 back in the day.
00:47:39 I quickly found out that the game
00:47:41 was based on
00:47:43 the original game.
00:47:45 It was based on the original game.
00:47:47 I quickly found out that the game
00:47:49 was based on
00:47:51 an anime,
00:47:53 and then I proceeded not to watch the anime
00:47:55 for a decade,
00:47:57 but I kept hearing about it
00:47:59 and I kept wondering about it
00:48:01 and I was really curious.
00:48:03 One day, I just decided
00:48:05 a couple of years back, I decided
00:48:07 I want to watch this thing.
00:48:09 I want to see what it's all about.
00:48:11 When I went into it, I had no idea it was considered good.
00:48:13 At first,
00:48:15 I thought I made a horrible mistake
00:48:17 to commit to watching to
00:48:19 several hundred episodes of
00:48:21 a new show that maybe
00:48:23 sucks.
00:48:25 What was the show?
00:48:27 Yu Yu Hakushu.
00:48:29 I didn't know it was good,
00:48:31 but I remember while I was watching it,
00:48:33 I saw
00:48:35 Trixie
00:48:37 back when she was
00:48:39 Digibro.
00:48:41 I saw her tweet out
00:48:43 a recommendation.
00:48:45 I saw her recommend
00:48:47 Yu Yu Hakushu.
00:48:49 She said it was one of the best
00:48:51 animes or something.
00:48:53 She liked that one.
00:48:55 When I saw that,
00:48:57 I felt kind of vindicated.
00:48:59 When I saw that, I felt kind of vindicated.
00:49:01 I felt like I made a good choice.
00:49:03 If the anime expert
00:49:05 Digibro thinks it's good,
00:49:07 then I must have picked well.
00:49:09 I watched the whole thing
00:49:11 and I really liked it.
00:49:13 Her recommendation
00:49:15 is probably
00:49:17 one of my favorite shounen
00:49:19 so far that I've seen.
00:49:21 Her recommendation is what got me to
00:49:23 watch Ultimate Survivor Kaiji,
00:49:25 which is so good.
00:49:27 When people talk about
00:49:29 Squid Game, I can go,
00:49:31 Kaiji did it first.
00:49:33 Kaiji was better, probably. I haven't actually seen Squid Game.
00:49:35 I haven't seen it either.
00:49:37 When people say it's like Kaiji,
00:49:39 I know what they're talking about.
00:49:41 Because I guess they're both about
00:49:43 people in death games
00:49:45 trying to get out of debt.
00:49:47 The most recent
00:49:49 anime film.
00:49:51 Well, yeah.
00:49:53 They were both about society.
00:49:59 The most recent one I watched
00:50:01 was The Little Prince and the Eight Headed Dragon.
00:50:03 I've never even heard of that.
00:50:05 It's an early Toei,
00:50:07 really early.
00:50:09 I think it said in the
00:50:11 credits that Issao Takahata
00:50:13 was one of the assistant directors.
00:50:15 Who's Takahata?
00:50:17 What did he do?
00:50:19 Takahata and Miyazaki are the two big guys
00:50:21 at Ghibli.
00:50:23 Oh, Takahata is probably
00:50:25 the guy that made this.
00:50:27 He's probably the guy that made this.
00:50:29 What's that stupid one?
00:50:31 Only yesterday?
00:50:33 That one that
00:50:35 kind of sucks.
00:50:37 I don't know actually.
00:50:39 Is the dragon based on
00:50:41 Orochi or whatever it's called?
00:50:43 It is. This Little Prince is
00:50:45 Susano and it's Orochi.
00:50:47 Oh, I played
00:50:49 the dog game.
00:50:51 I played Okami.
00:50:53 I recognized it's like Nagi and
00:50:55 Nami and Susano.
00:50:57 It's like
00:50:59 really, really well animated.
00:51:01 Really quite western.
00:51:03 It's so early on in anime production
00:51:05 that they're like still lip-syncing.
00:51:07 They're lip-syncing to the actual sounds
00:51:09 that the actors are making
00:51:11 rather than just opening the mouth flaps.
00:51:13 This looks really bizarre.
00:51:15 It's really good.
00:51:17 It looks very
00:51:19 modern?
00:51:21 It doesn't look...
00:51:23 Yeah, it looks like
00:51:25 Samurai Jack. I see there's
00:51:27 something. Yeah, Samurai Jack
00:51:29 was inspired heavily.
00:51:31 Samurai Jack was inspired heavily from this.
00:51:33 This is like a 60's
00:51:35 anime movie and it's like
00:51:37 one of the big
00:51:39 early things that is like super influential
00:51:41 and I noticed
00:51:43 that Susano himself
00:51:45 looks so much
00:51:47 like Toon Link that
00:51:49 it can't be a coincidence. This is definitely
00:51:51 like the inspiration for Toon Link
00:51:53 and a lot of other little things.
00:51:55 He really does now that you mentioned it.
00:51:57 Why is he writing
00:51:59 My Little Pony?
00:52:01 That is
00:52:03 a cute little freaking horse.
00:52:05 It's a flying horse, not a Pegasus.
00:52:07 No, he just flies.
00:52:09 He's so cute because instead of
00:52:11 flapping wings, he just
00:52:13 kicks his little legs really, really fast
00:52:15 to move quicker.
00:52:17 I'm trying to find a cool gif.
00:52:19 He flies with the power of friendship.
00:52:21 He flies with the power of
00:52:23 I'm a flying horse.
00:52:25 He flies with honesty, loyalty,
00:52:27 laughter,
00:52:29 friendliness,
00:52:31 kindness,
00:52:33 kindness,
00:52:35 this play, why will it not play?
00:52:37 No, stick to it in this
00:52:39 trustworthy, loyal, helpful,
00:52:41 friendly, courteous, kind of beating, cheerful,
00:52:43 thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent, I believe.
00:52:47 How do I get a, I don't know
00:52:49 how to fucking make a gif be posted
00:52:51 in a fucking chat. I hate this so much.
00:52:53 Right click it,
00:52:55 and save it, and then
00:52:57 click it and drag it.
00:52:59 This sucks. This sucks so much.
00:53:01 Yeah.
00:53:03 Hell yeah, it does.
00:53:05 I want you to see the funny little
00:53:07 leg kicking.
00:53:09 Well, go to the web page.
00:53:11 You'll see them. Oh, fine.
00:53:13 Okay.
00:53:15 Let's see this little,
00:53:17 he's just flapping his little legs.
00:53:19 What?
00:53:21 This does not look like it was from the
00:53:23 60s.
00:53:25 Well yeah, this is before anime has
00:53:27 solidified a look.
00:53:29 It's very much like
00:53:31 copying the western
00:53:33 animation that is around before that.
00:53:35 It feels a bit like
00:53:37 like, um,
00:53:39 oh god, what were they doing
00:53:41 at this time?
00:53:43 In Disney and stuff, I'm not sure.
00:53:45 But it feels familiar with a lot of the
00:53:47 backgrounds and stuff, but different
00:53:49 because it's made in Japan.
00:53:51 It's cool.
00:53:53 It's kind of like how Astro Boy doesn't
00:53:55 look like a lot of modern anime.
00:53:57 What was called Astro Boy?
00:53:59 This looks like
00:54:01 they were,
00:54:03 you know,
00:54:05 Astro Boy and all the,
00:54:07 who's the Astro Boy guy?
00:54:09 The guy who made every fucking thing?
00:54:11 Osamu Tezuka, I think?
00:54:13 Yes, Tezuka.
00:54:15 The Tezuka, what do you call it,
00:54:17 ethos, is like,
00:54:19 cut down
00:54:21 on everything. Minimize everything.
00:54:23 Cut frames,
00:54:25 animate on thirds instead of twos.
00:54:27 This looks like it's the exact opposite.
00:54:29 They were like, no, we're gonna
00:54:31 make this
00:54:33 as hard as possible.
00:54:35 We're gonna fully animate all the mouths.
00:54:37 It's gonna be every frame.
00:54:39 It looks like they were like, nah,
00:54:41 fuck cost saving measures.
00:54:43 We're going all out and we're gonna make
00:54:45 a masterpiece was what they were going for
00:54:47 here.
00:54:49 Doesn't look lazy at all
00:54:51 because, you know,
00:54:53 early anime was made
00:54:55 because
00:54:57 they made it as cheaply as possible.
00:54:59 They pumped it out.
00:55:01 Yeah, this is before all that
00:55:03 bullshit.
00:55:05 This is that real shit.
00:55:07 Is this before Tezuka?
00:55:09 Uh...
00:55:11 No.
00:55:13 Let's see.
00:55:15 Osamu Tezuka.
00:55:17 I don't think so because I think
00:55:19 Atomic, I mean,
00:55:21 Astro Boy was one of the first enemies ever
00:55:23 and I think it originally aired in black and white.
00:55:25 Plus, it's TV.
00:55:27 This is a movie. They used to make movies
00:55:29 before they were doing TV as an anime thing.
00:55:31 Yeah.
00:55:33 Okay, so Astro Boy,
00:55:35 the Astro Boy manga was serialized
00:55:37 from 1952 to
00:55:39 1968.
00:55:41 So it would have been contemporary
00:55:43 with Astro Boy and
00:55:45 Tezuka and stuff.
00:55:47 So I guess it was kind of at the same
00:55:49 time.
00:55:51 Well, since then you had a dragon
00:55:53 d-d-d-d-d, released in 1963.
00:55:55 So maybe it'll be after.
00:55:57 I don't think the Astro Boy
00:55:59 anime would have been around, but
00:56:01 the manga certainly, certainly would have been.
00:56:03 The Astro Boy...
00:56:05 Okay, the Astro Boy...
00:56:07 Yeah, the anime series started
00:56:09 in the same year, 1963.
00:56:11 Wow.
00:56:13 Yeah.
00:56:15 Everybody's like, everybody's like,
00:56:17 let's just be animators now, and they all did.
00:56:19 It premieres...
00:56:21 Why does it say this? Is a Japanese television series
00:56:23 that premiered on Fuji TV on New
00:56:25 Year's Day, 1963.
00:56:27 A Tuesday.
00:56:29 I don't know why it mentions that it's a Tuesday,
00:56:31 okay. It was a Tuesday.
00:56:33 It was a Tuesday in case you were wondering.
00:56:35 Thanks, I was.
00:56:37 Well, at least it wasn't a Monday.
00:56:39 I don't even know...
00:56:41 I hate Monon's days. Anime would never have gotten
00:56:43 off to... would never have gone
00:56:45 the places it went if it started on a Monday.
00:56:47 Could you imagine
00:56:49 a fucking Japanese made
00:56:51 Garfield strip?
00:56:53 It's the same, but Garfield
00:56:55 just likes, I don't know,
00:56:57 sushi instead of lasagna.
00:56:59 I bet...
00:57:01 Yeah, the Japanese
00:57:03 Garfields.
00:57:05 I bet there are, like,
00:57:07 some equivalent.
00:57:09 Like, someone in Japan,
00:57:11 where comics are so popular,
00:57:13 someone in Japan had to be like,
00:57:15 wow, Garfield is the most popular fucking thing
00:57:17 in the universe.
00:57:19 I should just basically make Garfield,
00:57:21 but...
00:57:23 but me, but it's me doing it.
00:57:25 I bet someone did it.
00:57:27 It's hard to find, because if you type in Japanese
00:57:29 Garfields, you'll get memes upon memes.
00:57:31 You'll never find an actual real thing.
00:57:33 I mean, if you're a manga artist
00:57:35 and you're looking at, like, the landscape,
00:57:37 you're, like, and you're looking at, like, hmm,
00:57:39 you know, what is successful in my industry?
00:57:41 You're, like, oh...
00:57:43 Garfields.
00:57:45 That's, like, the Garfields
00:57:47 and peanuts. At some point, you must have
00:57:49 looked at the landscape and been, like, Garfield is dominating.
00:57:51 I have to make my own Garfield.
00:57:53 I have to ride Garfield's coattails.
00:57:55 That's the only way. Somebody must have done it.
00:57:57 Hmm.
00:57:59 Garfield, uh, why did you eat all my sushi?
00:58:01 Terrible.
00:58:03 Just terrible.
00:58:05 Garfield, let me...
00:58:07 You better commit seppuku now.
00:58:09 Garfield does not do that.
00:58:11 You better commit hirakiri. I mean seppuku.
00:58:13 Dude, the cat side of the bag now.
00:58:15 Rip off.
00:58:17 Japanese... I'm gonna look at a Japanese Garfield rip off.
00:58:21 Uh...
00:58:23 It turns out it was...
00:58:25 There was a Japanese Garfield that came out before
00:58:27 that inspired it.
00:58:29 Inspired Garfield.
00:58:31 Oh, Japanese Garfield leak.
00:58:33 Urusei Yatsura?
00:58:35 Oh.
00:58:37 Urusei Yatsura.
00:58:39 I think it's just a joke because she wears the
00:58:41 the orange stripes.
00:58:43 Okay, never mind.
00:58:45 This is a serious deep dive.
00:58:47 I want to find the one Japanese artist
00:58:49 who is like, oh, Garfield, I could do that.
00:58:51 I have a cat. I could do this.
00:58:53 I'm not finding it.
00:58:55 I'm not finding it, so maybe it didn't happen.
00:58:57 No.
00:58:59 They must have had...
00:59:01 I mean, they had, like, newspaper
00:59:03 strips, right,
00:59:05 in...
00:59:07 Not even sure.
00:59:09 Well, they would probably do, like,
00:59:11 4-coma, right?
00:59:13 Like the vertical. I mean, they probably formatted
00:59:15 differently, but, like, people made...
00:59:17 Japanese?
00:59:19 Maybe that kind of, like,
00:59:21 newspaper strip, basically.
00:59:23 Yeah, I guess they would usually do the
00:59:25 4 panels instead of 3.
00:59:27 I don't know.
00:59:29 Yeah.
00:59:31 There must have been some
00:59:33 publication, some magazine or newspaper
00:59:35 that was like, let's run comic strips
00:59:37 like an American style.
00:59:39 Let's just kind of do it like that.
00:59:41 Maybe it'll take off.
00:59:43 Maybe it didn't.
00:59:45 I don't know.
00:59:47 But...
00:59:49 When I Google
00:59:51 Japanese Garfield Rip-Off, for some reason
00:59:53 I get the real Ghostbusters
00:59:55 1993 video game.
00:59:57 That's probably where Garfield
00:59:59 was ripped off.
01:00:01 It was, like, cat in the game.
01:00:03 Okay, the Japanese version is
01:00:05 based...
01:00:07 Based on Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse,
01:00:09 which is part of the Mickey Mouse side
01:00:11 of Chemco's Crazy Castle series,
01:00:13 while the European version is based
01:00:15 on Jim Davis's Garfield comic strips
01:00:17 and the animated series Garfield and Friends,
01:00:19 what are you talking about?
01:00:21 What are you talking about?
01:00:23 I don't know. That sounds pretty crazy.
01:00:25 Depending on which version is played,
01:00:27 the player controls Mickey Mouse,
01:00:29 Peter Venkman, or Garfield.
01:00:31 Okay.
01:00:33 What's this?
01:00:35 They just made
01:00:37 the same game
01:00:39 and just they made 3 different versions
01:00:41 of it and one of them
01:00:43 is Garfield and one of them is
01:00:45 Peter Venkman from Ghostbusters
01:00:47 and one of them is Mickey Mouse.
01:00:49 Is this Peter Venkman
01:00:51 supposed to be, like, the John of this
01:00:53 universe? The real Ghostbusters
01:00:55 known in Europe as Garfield Labyrinth
01:00:57 and in Japan as Mickey Mouse 4
01:00:59 Maho no Labyrinth.
01:01:01 I see, so they just rebranded the same game
01:01:03 multiple times. Why do they do it?
01:01:05 Why not just
01:01:07 release it the same?
01:01:09 It must have just been, they made the game. I gotta play this.
01:01:11 Yeah, we gotta play all three
01:01:13 and compare.
01:01:15 They must have just made the game and they were like,
01:01:17 okay, we've got the Mickey Mouse
01:01:19 license for Japan, but
01:01:21 we don't have it for America, so
01:01:23 we gotta get another license. Okay, we'll
01:01:25 put Ghostbusters in it.
01:01:27 There's no information here. There's no, like,
01:01:29 why did they do this?
01:01:31 Here's what the gameplay is and here's how people
01:01:33 thought about it. This kind of thing has happened
01:01:35 before with some of these old
01:01:37 Japanese games. Sometimes
01:01:39 they would get rebranded with different IP
01:01:41 characters and stuff.
01:01:43 Then actually
01:01:45 it originally happened
01:01:47 with the original
01:01:49 Donkey Kong.
01:01:51 The original Donkey Kong was supposed to be a
01:01:53 Popeye license game, but they couldn't
01:01:55 get the rights, so they
01:01:57 just redid all the characters
01:01:59 and it was the same game, basically.
01:02:01 But then later on, they did
01:02:03 get the rights to Popeye
01:02:05 and they did actually release a Popeye game
01:02:07 that nobody nowadays knows about.
01:02:09 I think they played that
01:02:11 on the Game Grumps, right? They played the
01:02:13 Popeye game on Game Grumps, I'm pretty sure.
01:02:15 I don't know, but I played it on my
01:02:17 channel.
01:02:19 I'm pretty damn sure that, wait,
01:02:21 you played it?
01:02:23 When I was young, we had this
01:02:25 family computer and there was
01:02:27 a Popeye game on it. I don't know
01:02:29 whether it was a rip-off of the Popeye
01:02:31 game or a strangely emulated version
01:02:33 that my parents got given
01:02:35 a bunch of, like, here's some games
01:02:37 for the kids.
01:02:39 There was also a Huckleberry Hound
01:02:41 game
01:02:43 and some other cartoon thing.
01:02:45 Fascinating.
01:02:47 But I feel like I've played the Popeye version
01:02:49 of the thing, because you got bladders and the shit.
01:02:51 Yeah, I played
01:02:53 the, you know, let's
01:02:55 play, let's pun, whatever
01:02:57 you want to call it, of the Popeye game
01:02:59 on my channel.
01:03:01 It's quite a few years ago now.
01:03:03 I'm not sure if I saw that one.
01:03:05 What a game.
01:03:07 What a choice of game.
01:03:09 What a world.
01:03:11 I mostly show
01:03:13 it because it was short.
01:03:15 You know, I know.
01:03:17 It's the one where you gotta like
01:03:19 collect Olive Oil's hearts.
01:03:21 Like her, she's like extruding hearts
01:03:23 and they're floating up and you gotta catch
01:03:25 them.
01:03:27 You know, the plot is that, you know,
01:03:29 Bluto, the antagonist, he wants to
01:03:31 know which is Popeye's girlfriend and
01:03:33 you know, the joke I told in my play
01:03:35 through is, you know, Popeye
01:03:37 likes his girl, Popeye likes
01:03:39 his Olive Oil extra version.
01:03:41 Oh, god.
01:03:43 Yeah, true.
01:03:45 True, yeah.
01:03:47 It's a pretty good line, I think.
01:03:49 I saw, I saw a,
01:03:51 I saw a
01:03:53 a strip.
01:03:55 No, it's Popeye 2. Sorry, I had to interrupt.
01:03:57 But I found Popeye, it's Popeye 2
01:03:59 of the PC.
01:04:01 I played Popeye 2 of the PC when I was young.
01:04:03 This is nostalgia.
01:04:05 I saw a Popeye strip where like an
01:04:07 interviewer is asking Popeye
01:04:09 like his opinions on like
01:04:11 various political issues of the day
01:04:13 and Popeye gives
01:04:15 like his, his,
01:04:17 he's asking him about like, Popeye,
01:04:19 are you a fan of like prohibition
01:04:21 and stuff and
01:04:23 I mean, I'm trying to find it.
01:04:25 And Popeye's response is just,
01:04:27 you know, I just eat spinach, man.
01:04:29 I don't know what to tell you.
01:04:31 No, he says, he says,
01:04:33 he asks, what do you think about
01:04:35 prohibition and he says, I don't like
01:04:37 to think about it or something.
01:04:39 But that sounds like something he'd say.
01:04:41 There was more though.
01:04:43 He asked him like a dozen questions about
01:04:45 like the various social
01:04:47 ills that were plaguing like
01:04:49 prohibition era America.
01:04:53 He mostly, he mostly doesn't have
01:04:55 opinions about them.
01:04:57 Have you seen that Twitter account
01:04:59 that is like official Popeye
01:05:01 but Popeye is like super trans positive?
01:05:03 No.
01:05:05 Wait, it's official. I don't know what it's called.
01:05:07 I think it was official. It's just so like
01:05:09 Popeye, the official Twitter account
01:05:11 and it's just sort of like celebrating
01:05:13 like, you know, LGBT
01:05:15 issues and stuff.
01:05:17 And people like, oh, based Popeye.
01:05:19 No, I like it.
01:05:21 It was cool. It was cute. I feel like
01:05:23 if you asked Popeye about
01:05:25 that sort of thing, you'd be like
01:05:27 hey, Popeye, what do you think about
01:05:29 transgenderism and he'd be like
01:05:31 trans-what-ism?
01:05:33 He'd be
01:05:35 he'd be funnier
01:05:37 about it.
01:05:41 I am what I am.
01:05:45 Damn it. I found this.
01:05:47 They am what they am.
01:05:49 I found this
01:05:51 cropped version which doesn't have
01:05:53 all the questions.
01:05:55 It only has like half of them.
01:05:57 There was more. He asked me about prohibition.
01:05:59 Do you-do you drink?
01:06:01 I refuse this to answer on account of
01:06:03 it might incrinimate me.
01:06:07 What is your religion? Treat everybody right.
01:06:09 And if they steps on your sockum.
01:06:11 Yeah, like based.
01:06:13 Such wisdom. It was like that
01:06:15 attitude but for trans rights, it was great.
01:06:17 Right, right.
01:06:19 Sockum.
01:06:21 Rockum. Sockum.
01:06:23 Robots.
01:06:25 Paised. Okay, cool.
01:06:27 Popeye is a
01:06:29 he always taught the kids to eat spinach
01:06:31 and spinach is pretty good for you.
01:06:35 Yeah.
01:06:37 I-I-I...
01:06:39 Damn it. I just thought it was interesting
01:06:41 to see them being like
01:06:43 hey, Popeye.
01:06:45 It's the past.
01:06:47 We are in the good old days
01:06:49 but our society has problems.
01:06:51 What do you-what do you think about them?
01:06:53 Popeye, what's your opinion
01:06:55 on cancel culture?
01:06:57 What's your take on
01:06:59 what's your take on
01:07:01 the abortion bill that they just passed
01:07:03 in Texas, Popeye? Please, we need
01:07:05 to know.
01:07:07 That would be a great
01:07:09 political comic.
01:07:11 That's what this would have been
01:07:13 if this was made like today.
01:07:15 Instead of asking about prohibition.
01:07:17 Oh, wait.
01:07:19 This is...
01:07:21 You know, I used to strangely be a big fan
01:07:23 of the Popeye black and white cartoons
01:07:25 when I was a kid.
01:07:27 Look at him.
01:07:29 Look at him.
01:07:31 Yeah, I'm disgusted.
01:07:33 Yeah, I'm disgusted. Great.
01:07:35 That's an all-timeer.
01:07:37 That's like constipated
01:07:39 but more disgusting.
01:07:41 Yes.
01:07:43 I'm disgusted and also constipated.
01:07:45 I hope so.
01:07:47 What were we talking about?
01:07:49 Yeah, I was a fan of the old
01:07:51 black and white Popeye cartoons
01:07:53 mostly because I really liked the animation.
01:07:55 Sure.
01:07:57 It was...
01:07:59 I think they made it in like the 1940s
01:08:01 or 1930s or something.
01:08:03 It was a long time ago.
01:08:05 Before television.
01:08:07 And I was just really impressed
01:08:09 with how well animated it was.
01:08:11 I guess they would have shown
01:08:13 in like movie theaters, right?
01:08:15 Yeah, I read they used to show them
01:08:17 in movie theaters before a movie
01:08:19 either before or after a movie.
01:08:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:08:23 The...
01:08:25 Yeah, the television like changed
01:08:27 the format.
01:08:29 Yeah, everything was either like a short,
01:08:31 like an animated short,
01:08:33 or like a feature-length film.
01:08:35 And then...
01:08:37 That's Disney...
01:08:39 Yeah, because like when Disney started,
01:08:41 it was, yeah, it was pre-television,
01:08:43 so they made movies because it's the only thing
01:08:45 you could see animation in.
01:08:47 You'd see a feature length.
01:08:49 Yeah, the very first Disney...
01:08:51 Well, you would go to the theater
01:08:53 and there would be like a little short played
01:08:55 like a live action movie.
01:08:57 You would have the cartoons.
01:08:59 Yeah, I think the very first Disney
01:09:01 animated short was
01:09:03 Steamboat Willie.
01:09:05 And I think it came out in 1928.
01:09:07 Damn, Mickey Mouse is so old,
01:09:09 he'd be dead if he was a real mouse.
01:09:11 Well, I sure wish
01:09:13 he would enter the public domain by now,
01:09:15 you know.
01:09:17 Yeah, everyone's gagging
01:09:19 to draw Mickey Mouse.
01:09:21 I can't do it.
01:09:23 You know, those old Popeye cartoons
01:09:25 were really... they had really impressive
01:09:27 animation, even by today's standards.
01:09:29 Like, I saw somebody
01:09:31 comparing the animation of one
01:09:33 of the Popeye fight scenes
01:09:35 to like a Dragon Ball Z
01:09:37 fight scene.
01:09:39 And the Popeye scene actually looked better
01:09:41 than the average Dragon Ball fight scene.
01:09:43 It's because they had...
01:09:45 Well, they're more animated.
01:09:47 They animated on ones
01:09:49 because the idea
01:09:51 of saving money and time
01:09:53 to make it
01:09:55 so that you could animate on twos
01:09:57 and have less drawings
01:09:59 would make it cheaper.
01:10:01 But animation
01:10:03 it was a high-skill, high-paid
01:10:05 like luxury sort of industry
01:10:07 initially.
01:10:09 You only had so many of them working on it.
01:10:11 And then since it became so popular
01:10:13 it was like, oh, we got to mass-produce this stuff.
01:10:15 We got to make it cheaper.
01:10:17 And thus, Dragon Ball Z
01:10:19 was one to the other.
01:10:21 Yeah, I was in a...
01:10:23 When they syndicated the Popeye cartoon,
01:10:27 they made it a lot more cheaply
01:10:29 and it was a lot, you know, not as well animated.
01:10:31 I think this happened around the 60s and 70s.
01:10:33 And I didn't enjoy those
01:10:35 Popeye cartoons as much because
01:10:37 I just appreciated
01:10:39 the better animation of the shorts
01:10:41 they used to do in the past.
01:10:43 By the way,
01:10:45 this image here
01:10:47 that I posted, I think
01:10:49 this was blowing up on Twitter.
01:10:51 Somebody was saying, oh, based on non-binary Popeye
01:10:53 because he's wearing women's clothes
01:10:55 and he's like...
01:10:57 I promise you, I won't be mad at me
01:10:59 for wearing something.
01:11:01 Of course, I won't be mad at my little wifey.
01:11:03 What is it? I am amphibious.
01:11:05 Amphibious.
01:11:07 I wears both women's and man's clothes.
01:11:09 Arf, arf, I am Popeye.
01:11:11 What the fuck is he talking about?
01:11:13 I don't know, this kind of confuses me.
01:11:15 I am old.
01:11:17 It's just sort of like a funny like,
01:11:19 oh, Popeye wearing both men and women clothes
01:11:21 and then it's like, oh, non-binary icon Popeye.
01:11:23 I think it was like a joke.
01:11:25 But then Popeye, the official account got in on it.
01:11:27 I agree.
01:11:29 And then it started all that stuff.
01:11:31 I don't know if this was meant to be.
01:11:33 Why does he bark?
01:11:35 After coming out is amphibious.
01:11:37 He barks.
01:11:39 Yeah, you would think he would croak.
01:11:41 Yeah, definitely.
01:11:45 Popeye is definitely pretty cool.
01:11:47 He should be in Spanish, actually.
01:11:49 I have no idea.
01:11:51 Why is he married to this
01:11:53 surly strong man?
01:11:57 Probably for some reason.
01:11:59 I'm not familiar with this.
01:12:01 One assumes it is for some reason.
01:12:03 I was going to say something else
01:12:05 but I didn't think of it.
01:12:07 It's not for no reason.
01:12:11 When you're right, you're right.
01:12:15 Okay, okay.
01:12:17 Dude, segue.
01:12:19 Quick, somebody segue.
01:12:21 I have a segue.
01:12:23 It's from Popeye the Sailor, comic strip.
01:12:25 Clarissa Gunn-Spoke, comic strip.
01:12:27 Oh, right.
01:12:29 I finally read it.
01:12:31 What do you think?
01:12:33 Well, I don't think it's
01:12:35 much of a spoiler.
01:12:37 I'm very
01:12:39 interested in
01:12:41 what's going on
01:12:43 with the temple
01:12:45 and that dude's hat.
01:12:47 Something is up
01:12:49 and I want to know what's up
01:12:51 with that.
01:12:53 And that's where
01:12:55 I'm at with Clarissa.
01:12:57 Yeah.
01:12:59 Something's up and I assume
01:13:01 one day I will learn
01:13:03 what's up.
01:13:05 I'll string it along for like 50 years
01:13:07 and then I'll tell you.
01:13:09 It's like, hey, buy my new comic
01:13:11 and then you'll find out next time.
01:13:13 Never happens.
01:13:15 Ooh, that's how they get you.
01:13:17 Do the Dragon Ball Z thing
01:13:19 where Goku trains in the
01:13:21 chamber for like 50 episodes
01:13:23 and every episode is like
01:13:25 next time on Dragon Ball Z
01:13:27 maybe something will actually happen.
01:13:29 This planet will explode
01:13:31 in five minutes.
01:13:33 14 episodes later.
01:13:35 It finally blows up.
01:13:37 Yeah.
01:13:39 Yes, it was cool.
01:13:41 Are you making more?
01:13:43 When do I get to the end?
01:13:45 I will...
01:13:47 So I had written the end.
01:13:49 I want to go over it
01:13:51 and like see if I can
01:13:53 write it better because it's probably...
01:13:55 First draft is always
01:13:57 worse draft.
01:13:59 You can always improve little bits here and there.
01:14:01 So I want to go over it.
01:14:03 I anticipate
01:14:05 that very soon I will be
01:14:07 busy with Lord of Ghost kickstarter stuff
01:14:09 because the plushes have arrived
01:14:11 and they're sitting in a box.
01:14:13 I didn't want to take them out
01:14:15 just yet, just in case
01:14:17 I don't know
01:14:19 they get damaged
01:14:21 from being exposed to the air
01:14:23 or whatever.
01:14:25 Yeah, they crumble to dust.
01:14:27 Yeah, they're very fragile.
01:14:29 So they're just sitting in a box
01:14:31 and I've got the pins
01:14:33 and the rest of the artists
01:14:35 are drawing a lot of ghost stories.
01:14:37 I have drawn eight pages.
01:14:39 I have one page left to go.
01:14:41 One page left and then I can tell everyone else
01:14:43 Ben's Saint was faster than you
01:14:45 and it's truly embarrassing.
01:14:47 I'm never faster than anyone.
01:14:49 There's nothing more shameful
01:14:51 than Ben's Saint being faster than you.
01:14:53 It is, because not only am I slow
01:14:55 but also mine was the longest
01:14:57 by far.
01:14:59 But I did it, so
01:15:01 I haven't finished it yet, but soon.
01:15:03 I hope that shames them
01:15:05 into action.
01:15:07 So all of that is going to be
01:15:09 a lot of work.
01:15:11 But I will be
01:15:13 there at the ending of the Chorissa
01:15:15 and then sketching out a bunch of it.
01:15:17 Probably not
01:15:19 going to show anyone.
01:15:21 I was thinking of streaming it, but I'm not sure.
01:15:23 I feel like
01:15:25 I initially did those streams
01:15:27 last year because like,
01:15:29 oh shit, I'm so bad at working.
01:15:31 I need eyes on me to force
01:15:33 me to work and that was the stream.
01:15:35 But for this
01:15:37 finishing
01:15:39 of the comic and posting it,
01:15:41 I didn't stream it and I managed to work anyway.
01:15:43 So I was like, you know what, I don't
01:15:45 need to do that. It's fun, but
01:15:47 I don't need to. I'll do it if I really
01:15:49 feel like making an event of it.
01:15:51 I've always been kind of conflicted.
01:15:53 I'd like to keep it more like secret.
01:15:55 I've always been conflicted about
01:15:57 the idea of streaming a comic
01:15:59 that you're drawing because
01:16:01 on one hand it seems like
01:16:03 a lot of fun, but on the other hand it kind of spoils
01:16:05 the story and stuff.
01:16:07 So I would
01:16:09 I would
01:16:11 I'll do it in secret
01:16:13 and maybe
01:16:15 I'll stream other things. I'll stream
01:16:17 the beating Mario 2
01:16:19 or something, eventually. I'll get around to it.
01:16:21 I know the game is tough and you have been
01:16:23 anticipating that.
01:16:25 I've been waiting for that
01:16:27 momentous occasion
01:16:29 when you finally beat Mario 2.
01:16:31 I'll be so much of a gamer
01:16:33 to have beaten two Mario games
01:16:35 to have beaten two Mario games.
01:16:37 They'll make you
01:16:39 two points above
01:16:41 then Saint as a gamer.
01:16:43 I had all
01:16:45 the old NES Mario games
01:16:47 as a kid and I never beat
01:16:49 any of them because I was
01:16:51 a child and too stupid
01:16:53 too stupid to beat the game.
01:16:55 That's absolutely
01:16:57 shameful. I know!
01:16:59 You had the real deal
01:17:01 and you didn't even really do it.
01:17:03 No. I couldn't.
01:17:05 I tried.
01:17:07 Game's hard.
01:17:09 I assume I could probably do it
01:17:11 now. Probably I could
01:17:13 beat Mario now
01:17:15 if I wanted to. I just don't want to
01:17:17 is all.
01:17:19 Well now I wish I had
01:17:21 so I wouldn't be made fun of
01:17:23 but it's too late.
01:17:25 It's the only reason you would play a game
01:17:27 so you can make fun of people who didn't play it.
01:17:29 Yes.
01:17:31 I want to be the one making fun
01:17:33 of others. I don't want to be on the receiving end.
01:17:35 I want to be dishing it, not taking it
01:17:37 if you know what I'm saying.
01:17:39 Yeah, just like how
01:17:41 you never beat Final Fantasy
01:17:43 Tactics either.
01:17:45 No, I got stuck in the fucking
01:17:47 Y-Graph Castle or whatever.
01:17:49 Yeah. Stupid. And it's like one of
01:17:51 your favorite games too.
01:17:53 I don't know if I would
01:17:55 say it. I mean I like it a lot.
01:17:57 I don't know if I would say it was one of them.
01:17:59 Yeah. For a time it was.
01:18:01 The
01:18:03 Tactical RPG was my favorite genre
01:18:05 for when I was like
01:18:07 in high school. I love that shit.
01:18:09 I do admit though
01:18:11 that game is pretty complicated for a child
01:18:13 to beat.
01:18:15 Yeah.
01:18:17 I'm not exactly sure how I beat it as a child
01:18:21 but somehow I did.
01:18:23 I watched a speed run
01:18:25 of Vanguard Bandits the other
01:18:27 day.
01:18:29 The speedrunner
01:18:31 sometimes
01:18:33 sometimes the
01:18:35 speedrunner
01:18:37 is annoying.
01:18:39 The speedrunner
01:18:41 was very like reddit
01:18:43 core.
01:18:45 Her jokes were very reddit core and it made me go
01:18:47 ugh god.
01:18:49 Stop.
01:18:51 At least there weren't bad puns
01:18:53 being made constantly.
01:18:55 Ugh.
01:18:57 No.
01:18:59 That would be the absolute worst.
01:19:01 Yeah. I can't imagine watching a
01:19:03 let's play it like that.
01:19:05 Imagine doing a speedrun
01:19:07 making puns like lightning
01:19:09 speed
01:19:11 like perfectly executing everything but still
01:19:13 having time to say the puns.
01:19:15 That'd be impressive.
01:19:17 If you run the game
01:19:19 enough you probably have
01:19:21 you probably have a bunch of like jokes
01:19:23 and gaffes and goose that you've
01:19:25 thought up and probably said on stream
01:19:27 before.
01:19:29 For your big
01:19:31 games done quick
01:19:33 debut
01:19:35 you bust all those out
01:19:37 in a row. One after the other.
01:19:39 You lightning, you machine gun them out
01:19:41 for comedy
01:19:43 because you have your whole repertoire
01:19:45 to work with.
01:19:47 Then you can pull out all those
01:19:49 reddit jokes
01:19:51 to impress everyone.
01:19:53 Yeah.
01:19:55 Some gamers, man.
01:19:57 Some gamers are just
01:19:59 I'm trying to remember what specifically
01:20:01 was so reddit core about that one.
01:20:03 I don't know. They were just
01:20:05 very like
01:20:07 laughing a lot about like
01:20:09 dumb jokes.
01:20:11 References to something.
01:20:13 No. They were like
01:20:15 they thought it was really like
01:20:17 funny that like the game
01:20:19 had like crude humor
01:20:21 and like fart jokes in it
01:20:23 and like she thought she
01:20:25 made a joke about that as though it was
01:20:27 like a very embarrassing
01:20:29 thing and how it was so silly that the game
01:20:31 had politics but also
01:20:33 crude
01:20:35 jokes in it.
01:20:37 I don't know.
01:20:39 Could you believe it?
01:20:41 The goal of this video game.
01:20:43 I didn't know that game had
01:20:45 crude humor in it.
01:20:47 I mean it's got a little bit but
01:20:49 like oh and there's a character
01:20:51 who's like a ninja
01:20:53 she's like a ninja made mech
01:20:55 pilot and the speedrunner was just
01:20:57 like can you believe this character
01:20:59 yes you heard that right. A ninja
01:21:01 made mech
01:21:03 pilot and she's our waifu
01:21:05 now. It's like oh god
01:21:07 please spare me.
01:21:09 Please spare me.
01:21:11 Spare me. No.
01:21:13 So many things combined.
01:21:15 That game sounds pretty cool now.
01:21:17 It is it actually is
01:21:19 a very cool game. I remember
01:21:21 it was one of my it was like my favorite game
01:21:23 in in high school or
01:21:25 something like we're in like eighth grade or whatever
01:21:27 and I
01:21:29 rented it and I really liked it so I went
01:21:31 to go buy it. I went to GameStop and I like
01:21:33 asked the guy at GameStop like hey do you have
01:21:35 Vanguard bands and he's like yeah
01:21:37 I don't really like that game very much but we got
01:21:39 it. I was like okay
01:21:41 cool thanks for making me feel good about my
01:21:43 purchase but it seems kind of
01:21:45 unnecessary. Yeah
01:21:47 why do you gotta judge me for it?
01:21:51 It reminds me of a reflexive
01:21:53 game review. It's a
01:21:55 Final Fantasy Tactics tactical RPG
01:21:57 but you put your guys in
01:21:59 yeah you're in mech sort of like Front
01:22:01 Mission 3
01:22:03 and when you do an attack
01:22:05 you like choose like how you want to respond
01:22:07 to it and then it plays a little like 3D
01:22:09 it has a cool like full 3D
01:22:11 where like the two robot models will like
01:22:13 you know counter attack each other and stuff
01:22:15 it rules it rules.
01:22:17 Yeah I think you mentioned this
01:22:19 on on here before and I was
01:22:21 I probably was there for that because
01:22:23 it's so anime
01:22:25 I do remember this now. So fucking anime
01:22:27 I'll probably check it out eventually
01:22:29 you know I have a kind of a big
01:22:31 backlog of old games
01:22:33 that I play. Sure.
01:22:35 I think it's pretty neat
01:22:37 it's got multiple routes
01:22:39 do you like
01:22:41 depending on like your characters
01:22:43 like relationships with each other
01:22:45 you know you'll end up
01:22:47 supporting like one
01:22:49 like a different regimes
01:22:51 like which country do you want to support in the war
01:22:53 basically?
01:22:55 Which team of people do you ally yourself with?
01:22:57 That was also the case of Front Mission 3
01:22:59 I believe
01:23:01 but Front Mission 3
01:23:03 was kind of based on
01:23:05 real world
01:23:07 it kind of had like a futuristic real world setting
01:23:09 you know we'd use
01:23:11 actual countries and stuff
01:23:13 Vanguard Bandits is as anime
01:23:15 as it gets it's super
01:23:17 fantastical there's like an evil
01:23:19 mech that like runs on the blood of the innocent
01:23:21 that like the bad guy pilots
01:23:23 That kind of sounds
01:23:25 full metal alchemist to me
01:23:27 for some reason.
01:23:29 It's very
01:23:31 I don't even know it's very
01:23:33 it's very 90s fantasy shown in
01:23:35 cool
01:23:37 it's cool I like it
01:23:39 but I remember
01:23:41 I played in Beat Front
01:23:43 Mission 1 a while back
01:23:45 that one never came out
01:23:47 you know out of the US
01:23:49 officially but it has like
01:23:51 a translation patch
01:23:53 although I think it got officially released
01:23:55 on the DS in English
01:23:57 in the US but
01:23:59 I played the Super Nintendo version but
01:24:01 anyways what I liked about that game
01:24:03 that's kind of funny and the story is that
01:24:05 in the beginning you are a soldier and you work
01:24:07 for you know what's
01:24:09 the equivalent of like the United States
01:24:11 government or whatever
01:24:13 but it has a different name in the game
01:24:15 because it takes place in the future
01:24:17 and yeah
01:24:19 so eventually the government
01:24:21 you find out the government's evil and they're doing evil
01:24:23 experiments and
01:24:25 you defect
01:24:27 from the military and you become a fugitive
01:24:29 but then you like
01:24:31 you join
01:24:33 the opposite side
01:24:35 you join the enemy of the government you were working for
01:24:37 and then you fight
01:24:39 the government you were working for
01:24:41 so I guess you know
01:24:43 if you look at it in a real world setting
01:24:45 it's like you work for the US
01:24:47 you find out the US is evil
01:24:49 then you defect and you join I don't know
01:24:51 their enemy Russia
01:24:53 but then the thing is you find out
01:24:55 the KGB
01:24:57 then you find out that this other government
01:24:59 is also evil
01:25:01 oh no who would have thought
01:25:03 so then you just
01:25:05 wind up at the end of the game
01:25:07 a world wide fugitive
01:25:09 all the governments hate you
01:25:11 because all of them are evil
01:25:13 and I don't know
01:25:15 I thought it was kind of funny
01:25:17 um
01:25:19 that's front mission one
01:25:21 I think it's either front mission one
01:25:23 or front mission three I kind of forget
01:25:25 now because they both have really similar plots
01:25:27 uh
01:25:29 uh the um
01:25:31 yeah I played
01:25:33 front mission three for the playstation
01:25:35 and
01:25:37 I think yeah it's a tactical
01:25:39 role playing game grid based
01:25:41 fantasy tactics style thing but like
01:25:43 okay I was hunting
01:25:45 I might have mentioned this before I was hunting for music
01:25:47 to steal
01:25:49 from a video game to put in phantom's revenge
01:25:51 uh
01:25:53 and I settled the music that I ended up picking
01:25:55 that I thought was the most suited for the game
01:25:57 was the music from front mission
01:25:59 gun hazard
01:26:01 which I assumed is like
01:26:03 yeah I assumed it was it would be
01:26:05 like the same tactical RPG but no apparently
01:26:07 all the other front mission games
01:26:09 are tactical RPGs but front mission
01:26:11 gun hazard is like a side scrolling like
01:26:13 action shooter for some reason
01:26:15 I think I told you about uh gun hazard
01:26:17 one of the last times I was on
01:26:19 is that how you found out about it
01:26:21 no I think
01:26:23 I mentioned it last I had been I had been
01:26:25 like searching through
01:26:27 like games with like
01:26:29 people saying like what games had good
01:26:31 music I think I had found it
01:26:33 uh myself
01:26:35 somewhere I had I had been going through
01:26:37 lots of like like uh
01:26:39 youtube videos that have like uh uh you know
01:26:41 video game soundtracks in them
01:26:43 because I published
01:26:45 this actually I published a review
01:26:47 of gun hazard on my website back
01:26:49 in uh I don't remember when
01:26:51 it was like quite a while though
01:26:53 I was yeah I looked at because I was interested
01:26:55 I looked it up gameplay and I was like oh wow
01:26:57 no it's it's just they they made
01:26:59 one game in the series
01:27:01 just a completely different kind of game
01:27:03 for some reason yeah I did mention
01:27:05 it uh one of the times I was on
01:27:07 on here uh it's actually
01:27:09 probably my favorite
01:27:11 uh front mission game
01:27:13 because I'm a big fan of uh
01:27:15 side scrollers
01:27:17 and it has a pretty interesting story
01:27:19 you know also
01:27:21 yeah it looks cool I kind of wanted to
01:27:23 play it
01:27:25 if you can even if you can believe that
01:27:27 uh if
01:27:29 sorry that blows your mind yeah
01:27:31 well I certainly would recommend
01:27:33 it it is uh
01:27:35 you know this is the review that I
01:27:37 published in 2007
01:27:41 oh there it is
01:27:43 which is when I first uh discovered
01:27:45 and played this game
01:27:47 yeah I think it was yeah you are the one
01:27:49 that told me that it was a side scroller
01:27:51 and I was shocked I was like what the why is it
01:27:53 a side scroller
01:27:55 yeah I seem to remember telling you about it
01:27:57 um yeah that's right
01:27:59 I almost I forgot
01:28:01 uh yeah yeah because this is
01:28:03 this is a pretty obscure game that pretty much
01:28:05 nobody knows about
01:28:07 I feel like I'm the only person
01:28:09 that knows about this game and knows that it's
01:28:11 good and I'm the only one that recommends it
01:28:13 to people
01:28:15 that's why I thought it was the perfect game to
01:28:17 steal music from because nobody will have played
01:28:19 it and nobody will be like oh this is that song
01:28:21 from that other game
01:28:23 yeah pretty much
01:28:25 you know when it comes to obscure older
01:28:27 games I'm kind of an expert
01:28:29 on that so
01:28:31 if you ever need advice
01:28:33 on good music to steal from older
01:28:35 games have a
01:28:37 pretty huge list of obscure stuff
01:28:39 I think you you I think
01:28:41 you also recommended Mystic Arc
01:28:43 yeah I did I also
01:28:45 have a review for that
01:28:47 I looked that one up and I
01:28:49 thought the music was cool but it was too like
01:28:51 fantasy I like I like that gun hazard
01:28:53 had like had like a sci-fi
01:28:55 kind of vibe to it
01:28:57 it was more like yeah yeah
01:28:59 well you know gun hazard is
01:29:01 a game about giant mechs so
01:29:03 I know I know
01:29:05 so it's definitely
01:29:07 gonna have more sci-fi
01:29:09 to it I um yeah
01:29:11 yeah
01:29:13 damn imagine reviewing video games
01:29:15 yeah the Mystic Arc review
01:29:17 I published in 2014
01:29:19 hmm
01:29:21 I think I think
01:29:23 2014 was when Mystic Arc was
01:29:25 first unofficially translated
01:29:27 because there is no official translation
01:29:29 for that one
01:29:31 I see
01:29:33 I
01:29:35 okay obviously I can't
01:29:37 read these right now LeMau
01:29:39 um
01:29:41 you know by the way uh did you watch
01:29:43 that video that I sent you
01:29:45 a while back
01:29:47 which one
01:29:49 the Astros Playroom video
01:29:51 review that I did
01:29:53 yes I did I did watch the Astros Playroom
01:29:55 video
01:29:57 oh the little jumpity jump
01:29:59 3D
01:30:01 video was that
01:30:03 what did you think about that video
01:30:05 gave me a little chuckle
01:30:07 gave me a little chuckle
01:30:09 yeah
01:30:11 you should link it you should put link
01:30:13 there
01:30:15 put it in the description
01:30:17 gave me a little chuckle
01:30:19 it was like a
01:30:21 a different
01:30:23 sort of comedy almost
01:30:25 what's the word
01:30:27 non sequitur but not exactly
01:30:29 it's just sort of
01:30:31 yeah a little wacky
01:30:33 a little wacky
01:30:35 there it is
01:30:37 yeah it was a
01:30:39 bit of an experiment on my part
01:30:41 a lot of
01:30:43 it was my first time
01:30:45 trying to edit 4k footage
01:30:47 which was awful
01:30:49 really
01:30:51 my editing software did not like that at all
01:30:53 yeah
01:30:55 it kept crashing
01:30:57 and
01:30:59 you know first time doing a modern game
01:31:01 first time doing your video review
01:31:03 it's kind of weird
01:31:05 because I've been doing traditional text reviews
01:31:07 for like 10
01:31:09 15 years
01:31:11 but this is the first time I ever did a video
01:31:13 review
01:31:15 I mean I feel like
01:31:17 I feel like that's where the eyes are
01:31:19 that's where the eyes they're on youtube
01:31:21 though you're more likely to get
01:31:23 your review seen if it's a video
01:31:25 essay than if it's just a written
01:31:27 written one
01:31:29 how easy do you think it would be
01:31:31 get all of your text reviews
01:31:33 and just say
01:31:35 what the text was
01:31:37 and then have game footage
01:31:39 and then make like a million reviews
01:31:41 like that videos
01:31:43 well honestly
01:31:45 I don't think it would be too hard
01:31:47 I have over 500 of them so I could do that
01:31:49 for quite a while
01:31:51 oh my god that's content
01:31:53 think of the content
01:31:55 think of the amount of watch time
01:31:57 you could accrue if people be like
01:31:59 well I think
01:32:01 they type in obscure game into youtube
01:32:03 you gotta mind your paths for content
01:32:05 you already created
01:32:07 you already done most of the work
01:32:09 yeah that's true the writing
01:32:11 is kind of the hardest part
01:32:13 at this point the only time consuming thing
01:32:15 I think for that would be
01:32:17 to just capture the gameplay footage
01:32:19 you know that could take some time
01:32:21 yeah
01:32:23 depends on the game
01:32:25 could you steal it
01:32:27 you could take a long play footage
01:32:29 I mean I've done that before
01:32:31 it's like you credit the long play
01:32:33 where you get it from
01:32:35 but you have to provide credit for that though right
01:32:37 yeah just say where you got it
01:32:39 yeah
01:32:41 I don't know I have this kind of weird thing
01:32:43 where I hate using other people's work
01:32:45 you know
01:32:47 the way I see it though
01:32:49 is like if it's a long play
01:32:51 it's just footage of a game
01:32:53 it's not like they made the game
01:32:55 they're just recording the game
01:32:57 that they're playing
01:32:59 that's a good point
01:33:01 it's more of a service than anything
01:33:03 it's not really there like intellectual
01:33:05 property if it's just footage of the game
01:33:07 in my opinion
01:33:09 is that cheap
01:33:11 I don't think so
01:33:13 I suppose it's just a weird
01:33:15 mental thing I have where I feel like
01:33:17 I have to do everything by my own hand
01:33:19 including capturing the gameplay footage
01:33:21 you didn't develop the game did you
01:33:23 I mean
01:33:25 but the footage
01:33:27 the footage will be identical
01:33:29 if you capture it yourself
01:33:31 or if you use someone else
01:33:33 capturing the game right
01:33:35 yeah I know it's just a stupid mental thing
01:33:37 I have you know where I feel
01:33:39 I just feel psychologically
01:33:41 I want to be able to take full credit
01:33:43 for everything that's here
01:33:45 without giving anyone else credit
01:33:47 I am stealing music
01:33:49 from front mission gun hazard
01:33:51 and I don't feel bad about it
01:33:53 in the slightest
01:33:55 I'm taking it it's mine now
01:33:57 I feel like
01:33:59 you can extrapolate
01:34:01 that idea into like
01:34:03 well you didn't make the game
01:34:05 you didn't make the music
01:34:07 you're using in the background if you're using music
01:34:09 right
01:34:11 it's like
01:34:13 I don't think capturing
01:34:15 the gameplay is a line
01:34:17 that is
01:34:19 as arbitrary as any other I feel
01:34:21 yeah I know it's a pretty stupid thing
01:34:23 I'm just being dumb about it
01:34:25 you gotta be smart
01:34:27 we're gonna kick your ass
01:34:29 we're gonna kick your ass chrono
01:34:31 this is bullshit
01:34:33 in 2003
01:34:37 in 2003 some guy
01:34:39 made a banner from my website
01:34:41 and I did use it briefly but then eventually
01:34:43 I got rid of it because I just
01:34:45 didn't want to use anything
01:34:47 like anyone else
01:34:49 really?
01:34:51 even though he made it for you
01:34:53 he made it for free
01:34:55 so I was just like
01:34:57 okay that's cool
01:34:59 yeah
01:35:01 it was my hole
01:35:03 it was made for me
01:35:05 I just felt bad
01:35:07 I wanted everything to be made
01:35:09 by myself
01:35:11 I guess you can say it's a sigma male
01:35:13 mentality
01:35:15 definitely I would definitely call
01:35:17 it a sigma male mentality
01:35:19 very sigma trait
01:35:21 I made my own banner
01:35:23 which was way worse than his
01:35:25 and I used that instead
01:35:27 I mean
01:35:29 alright
01:35:31 I still have this banner actually
01:35:33 what if I
01:35:35 I'm gonna make you a banner
01:35:37 just to torture you
01:35:39 you won't be able to use it
01:35:41 yeah I don't know if I'll allow myself
01:35:43 to use it though
01:35:45 yeah
01:35:49 my
01:35:51 my neck is really sore
01:35:53 I'm moving my head around and it sucks
01:35:55 my neck hurts and I think the reason why
01:35:57 is because I was walking yesterday
01:35:59 I walked out I took a shower
01:36:01 and then I walked outside
01:36:03 and I thought I had some water in my ear
01:36:05 I thought I got some water stuck in my ear
01:36:07 so I did the thing where I like
01:36:09 shook my head right you shake your head
01:36:11 like shake the water to come out the ear
01:36:13 like I jumped on one foot and I like
01:36:15 jerked my head like get the water out
01:36:17 I didn't work
01:36:19 I don't think I actually had water in my ear
01:36:21 or if I did it was so little that like
01:36:23 it evaporated and it didn't matter
01:36:25 but yeah jerk in my head like that
01:36:27 fuck my neck up and
01:36:29 it hurts now
01:36:31 and also I'm hungover
01:36:33 when I have water in my ear I always do the thing
01:36:35 where you put you
01:36:37 press your palm up against your ear
01:36:39 and like suction it
01:36:41 I've done that
01:36:43 I've never tried
01:36:45 you know that episode of Seinfeld
01:36:47 where Kramer's got water in his ear
01:36:49 and he like he keeps jerking his head
01:36:51 and he like jumps up and down
01:36:53 Kramer doing that
01:36:55 well that's what I
01:36:57 I've never tried the hand suction thing
01:36:59 does that work?
01:37:01 well it's like a plunger
01:37:03 as long as the seal
01:37:05 the air is airtight
01:37:07 well yeah I mean
01:37:09 no but I do it anyway
01:37:11 it works because I learned it
01:37:13 when I was like in the swimming pool
01:37:15 I got water in my ear and I did that
01:37:17 and it's like and it's out
01:37:19 it's like oh cool
01:37:21 now I do that
01:37:23 for me sometimes it works
01:37:25 but actually I have now a
01:37:27 kind of a thing
01:37:29 a doohickey view
01:37:31 you want to call it
01:37:33 it's kind of like
01:37:35 I don't know what to call it
01:37:37 it's like a weird suction thing
01:37:39 that you can put in your ear to suck out
01:37:41 earwax
01:37:43 it's just a rubber
01:37:45 rubber ball like thing
01:37:47 with a tip at the end
01:37:49 I've seen those
01:37:51 do those work?
01:37:53 they can work if your earwax
01:37:55 is like movable
01:37:57 it would suck some of it out
01:37:59 and I think
01:38:01 maybe that could also work for water
01:38:03 if you have any water in your ears
01:38:05 yeah maybe
01:38:07 I've heard that like
01:38:09 sticking things in your ear
01:38:11 regardless of
01:38:13 like Q-tips and all that
01:38:15 it's a bad thing to do because you'll just push
01:38:17 the wax further in
01:38:19 the thing you gotta do
01:38:21 is you gotta get some
01:38:23 some olive oil
01:38:25 and I don't know
01:38:27 why this works but there's like
01:38:29 medical grade olive oil
01:38:31 ex-super virgin
01:38:33 I don't know what's the difference
01:38:35 but you drop like a few droplets of olive oil
01:38:37 in your ear and you lie down
01:38:39 and you let it go in there
01:38:41 and the olive oil
01:38:43 softens all of the earwax
01:38:45 and then you tip your head and it just all falls out
01:38:47 gross
01:38:49 I know it's gross
01:38:51 I'm gonna puke just thinking about it
01:38:53 but it feels like oh good
01:38:55 it's gone
01:38:57 yeah cause I had a really bad blockage one time
01:38:59 where I couldn't hear like
01:39:01 certain frequencies in my left ear
01:39:03 oh dear god
01:39:05 I couldn't hear like low notes so I was like oh this is fucking with me
01:39:07 cause my other ear could hear low notes
01:39:09 that sounds awful
01:39:11 so I needed to get that sorted out
01:39:13 and it just softens up the wax
01:39:15 so that it falls out
01:39:17 if you try to scrape it out you'll just push it further in
01:39:19 it'll be worse
01:39:21 we're here in the USA
01:39:23 we have special
01:39:25 liquids you can buy at the store
01:39:27 over the counter
01:39:29 pharmacy stuff
01:39:31 instead of olive oil
01:39:33 special American liquids
01:39:35 American like freedom liquid
01:39:37 yeah maybe olive oil works
01:39:39 just as well as that
01:39:41 pharmacy stuff
01:39:43 I'm just imagining the feeling of like tilting your head
01:39:45 and letting it just drip inside your ear
01:39:47 it sounds like a nightmare
01:39:49 it's strangely like good
01:39:51 cause it doesn't go like
01:39:53 I don't know it doesn't penetrate
01:39:55 it's just sort of like
01:39:57 doesn't break the rain barrier
01:39:59 no it's just sort of like
01:40:01 the over the counter stuff I'm talking about
01:40:03 like when there's a bit of water in your ear
01:40:05 when the shower, when there's water covering it
01:40:07 it's like
01:40:09 it makes that sort of feeling
01:40:11 the over counter stuff I'm talking about
01:40:13 is like ear drops that softens
01:40:15 the ear wax so I don't know I guess it's similar to
01:40:17 olive oil
01:40:19 I have heard of
01:40:21 stuff like that and also
01:40:23 ear foam that you put in your ear
01:40:25 that foams up
01:40:27 I don't understand
01:40:29 thinking about putting stuff in my ear
01:40:31 it's giving me the fear
01:40:33 it's giving me the existential room
01:40:35 it's giving me the ear fear
01:40:37 I had a bad blockage in my ear
01:40:39 a few times and I just
01:40:41 I went to the ear doctor
01:40:43 and they did this thing where they stick
01:40:45 like a hose into your ear
01:40:47 and they just shoot water into it
01:40:49 wait really
01:40:51 yeah they shoot
01:40:53 a ton of water directly into your ear drum
01:40:55 and it feels horrible
01:40:57 and
01:40:59 they call it like
01:41:01 irrigation, ear irrigation I think
01:41:03 irrigation
01:41:05 yeah exactly
01:41:07 and then the ear wax just kind of shoots out
01:41:09 and it spills into like a little
01:41:11 it shoots out the other side, goes straight through your brain
01:41:13 it kind of pours
01:41:15 into like a little cup they
01:41:17 hold next to your ear
01:41:19 you know
01:41:21 it doesn't feel good at all
01:41:23 but it did the job
01:41:25 cleared up my ears
01:41:27 that is
01:41:29 so weird, I would never think
01:41:31 to power wash the inside of my ear
01:41:33 that would be so loud
01:41:35 yeah it's loud and doesn't feel good
01:41:37 that's for sure
01:41:39 I don't like it
01:41:41 I don't want to talk about this anymore
01:41:43 but the good thing is
01:41:45 it gives you immediate relief
01:41:47 because the ear wax comes out immediately
01:41:49 you don't have to wait
01:41:51 like a few minutes or anything
01:41:57 Shiba Inu coin is up
01:41:59 it's not Dojo coin
01:42:01 it's a different coin
01:42:03 did you see Bitcoin went up to like
01:42:05 60 something
01:42:07 yes yes I saw
01:42:09 60 billion
01:42:11 I was and I'm still mad
01:42:13 even last week I was mad
01:42:15 about Bitcoin going up
01:42:17 and again
01:42:19 last week I complained about like
01:42:21 I was looking at it when it was around 40
01:42:23 and thinking maybe I should buy the dip
01:42:25 nah and now it's 60
01:42:27 so fuck me I guess
01:42:29 fuck me
01:42:31 what are you gonna do
01:42:33 I didn't buy any for a while
01:42:35 because I kind of
01:42:37 didn't do so hot last time
01:42:39 so I would just like
01:42:41 whatever
01:42:43 and now it's
01:42:45 it went up a lot so
01:42:47 I should have bought some
01:42:49 it is
01:42:51 yeah I mean obviously I wish I had bought it
01:42:53 when it was low and sold it when it was high
01:42:55 but you know
01:42:57 the same old story
01:42:59 the last time it was rallying
01:43:01 the last time it was going really high
01:43:03 I bought some as it was still going up
01:43:05 and yeah it went up some more
01:43:07 and I was like yes but then you know
01:43:09 and then I sold and I ended up
01:43:11 basically coming out
01:43:13 I think I lost like 100 bucks
01:43:15 or something so like
01:43:17 maybe not 100 maybe like 50
01:43:19 so
01:43:21 yeah it's like it's so easy
01:43:23 to look at the line going up and be like
01:43:25 line going up I should buy
01:43:27 line going up
01:43:29 but then you know it always goes down eventually
01:43:31 and then I don't know
01:43:33 the last time I
01:43:35 it's not like I was able to time it
01:43:37 or anything so like what what makes me think
01:43:39 I would do any better this time
01:43:41 yeah it
01:43:43 it went up a lot it went up almost 50%
01:43:45 in like a couple days there
01:43:47 but now you know it peaked and now it's a bit
01:43:49 down it's down like
01:43:51 it's down like 10%
01:43:53 which is a pretty big dip actually
01:43:55 so like if you bought it when it was peaking at
01:43:57 like 7
01:43:59 like you know 66k
01:44:01 and you're like oh shit we're going to the moon
01:44:03 or whatever
01:44:05 you've lost 10% of your investment
01:44:07 so that's not good I mean maybe it'll
01:44:09 maybe it'll bounce and keep going up
01:44:11 who knows well the strategy
01:44:13 pretty steep peak at the moment it's kind
01:44:15 of
01:44:17 the strategy I always use
01:44:19 is you can't lose if you don't
01:44:21 sell so if you buy and it goes down
01:44:23 just keep waiting and
01:44:25 hope to God it goes up again
01:44:27 that's the I mean
01:44:29 you could see it like that you could also
01:44:31 you could also look at it as
01:44:33 the long term value
01:44:35 of any of any investment
01:44:37 is zero like once you've invested
01:44:39 anything the money the consider the money
01:44:41 gone and like anything you
01:44:43 get back from it
01:44:45 is like okay
01:44:47 it's just a bonus
01:44:49 right like if you have a held asset
01:44:51 and it's simply held it's not
01:44:53 it's not worth anything you have to sell it
01:44:55 eventually if you if you're going to get anything
01:44:57 right
01:44:59 I suppose so that's
01:45:01 you know that's not how
01:45:03 that's not how the billionaires calculate
01:45:05 their their self-worth you know
01:45:07 I guess I guess that's
01:45:09 true I don't I don't really understand
01:45:11 the mindset of the people who are like hold
01:45:13 forever like literally hold forever
01:45:15 like
01:45:17 surely you will sell eventually I guess they
01:45:19 I don't think anybody thinks hold forever
01:45:21 but they think it doesn't matter how
01:45:23 bad it's getting if you hold it'll
01:45:25 eventually go higher than it was
01:45:27 I guess they they might never sell out
01:45:29 at a loss I think is what they they're actually saying
01:45:31 well that's what I said
01:45:33 they might be thinking that like
01:45:35 it will you know it will see
01:45:37 such mainstream adoption one day
01:45:39 that eventually Bitcoin will just become
01:45:41 their money right and then they will
01:45:43 spend it you know with
01:45:45 wallet to wallet transfers
01:45:47 instead of spending their
01:45:49 you know I think that's a
01:45:51 overly optimistic
01:45:53 viewpoint
01:45:55 I personally don't believe that would happen
01:45:57 I also
01:45:59 don't really think it's good I mean I don't
01:46:01 think it's going to replace money
01:46:03 I do I mean
01:46:05 it might see some more mainstream
01:46:07 I mean it is becoming a bit more mainstream
01:46:09 now I think that's what
01:46:11 the like the hold forever I think that's
01:46:13 what they're banking on they think that Bitcoin will just
01:46:15 become money one day
01:46:17 yeah yeah well
01:46:19 I don't yeah I guess all I
01:46:21 can say is good luck to them
01:46:23 you know yeah
01:46:25 I'm wondering about like
01:46:27 how
01:46:29 valuable Bitcoin can be
01:46:31 because like say
01:46:33 hypothetically everybody got in early
01:46:35 and they've got like
01:46:37 a bunch of Bitcoin sure and then
01:46:39 it goes to the moon and then you've got
01:46:41 like hundreds upon hundreds
01:46:43 of billionaires spending
01:46:45 money does that how does
01:46:47 does that even make sense
01:46:49 like how how does this
01:46:51 wouldn't wouldn't Bitcoin itself
01:46:53 lose value if everybody has so much of it
01:46:55 no no because
01:46:57 well everybody
01:46:59 okay well what you're describing
01:47:01 if you're thinking of physical things that people buy
01:47:03 like food and whatever
01:47:05 well if everybody had a little bit of Bitcoin
01:47:07 if you had spread out the Bitcoin
01:47:09 before it went to the moon you know it would still
01:47:11 the total amount of Bitcoin
01:47:13 worth would still would still be the same
01:47:15 the market cap or whatever would still be the same it would
01:47:17 just be more distributed among more
01:47:19 people yeah I think Bitcoin
01:47:21 there's a limited number there's a limited amount
01:47:23 of Bitcoin that that can exist
01:47:25 yeah I think there's a hard limit on how much
01:47:27 Bitcoin can exist so
01:47:29 yeah that theoretically
01:47:31 should never become
01:47:33 valueless because of that
01:47:35 you know like the dollar
01:47:37 you know how the dollar is valueless because we just
01:47:39 keep printing more of it
01:47:43 what do you mean it's valueless
01:47:45 well that's the case for like all
01:47:47 fiat currency
01:47:49 the government just determines what the
01:47:51 value is it has no intrinsic
01:47:53 value
01:47:55 sure yeah of course
01:47:57 and when I mean that's
01:47:59 you know whenever a government is in debt
01:48:01 they just print more money usually to
01:48:03 kind of deal with that
01:48:05 in addition to borrowing money and
01:48:07 all the typical things they do
01:48:09 borrowing money
01:48:11 is good actually
01:48:13 national debt is good
01:48:15 actually
01:48:17 well they certainly do a lot of that
01:48:19 so
01:48:21 I guess maybe it's good
01:48:23 it is
01:48:25 it actually is good like it's not
01:48:27 it's not bad that America like
01:48:29 has debt to its citizens
01:48:31 it's actually fine
01:48:33 as long as they don't default
01:48:35 this is business
01:48:37 well didn't they default one time
01:48:39 I remember
01:48:41 like years ago they
01:48:43 they defaulted on a payment and then
01:48:45 they had to raise a debt ceiling or something
01:48:47 I can't remember
01:48:49 are you talking about with the under Obama
01:48:51 this is
01:48:53 this is related to that article I linked
01:48:55 two weeks ago about the minting the coin
01:48:57 the trillion dollar
01:48:59 biden platinum coin
01:49:01 yeah they had
01:49:03 they had to raise the debt ceiling under Obama
01:49:05 and the republicans were like
01:49:07 oh he raised the debt ceiling
01:49:09 that's bad but it's like no
01:49:11 actually raising the debt ceiling is just
01:49:13 what everybody knows you have to do sometimes
01:49:15 but
01:49:17 if you can get someone else to do it
01:49:19 you can point at them and go aha
01:49:21 he raised the debt ceiling
01:49:23 he's a spendocrat
01:49:25 he's a spendocrat Jerry
01:49:27 I think
01:49:29 the only issue is if they like
01:49:31 keep increasing the money supply too quickly
01:49:33 which doesn't really
01:49:35 I don't think is related to the debt
01:49:37 but if they increase the money supply too quickly
01:49:39 then the value of the currency goes down
01:49:41 yeah hyperinflation
01:49:43 it can happen
01:49:45 I don't think we're at risk of it happening right now
01:49:47 I suppose that
01:49:49 was supposed to be the point of bitcoin
01:49:51 to try and prevent that from happening
01:49:53 but I don't know
01:49:55 the point of bitcoin
01:49:57 to replace fiat currency
01:49:59 was supposed to be the point of bitcoin
01:50:03 not memeing the point of bitcoin
01:50:05 is to be able to
01:50:07 have money
01:50:09 and buy things without paying taxes on it
01:50:11 that is the point of bitcoin
01:50:13 is to
01:50:15 be undetectable by the government
01:50:17 that sounds pretty cool to me
01:50:19 taxes
01:50:21 I guess so
01:50:23 I guess I can see the appeal
01:50:25 but I mean it's
01:50:27 it's not gonna
01:50:29 it's just gonna get regulated
01:50:31 it's just gonna get regulated and become
01:50:33 a regular thing
01:50:35 that you gotta pay taxes on
01:50:37 there's two outcomes
01:50:39 either the government just outright bans bitcoin
01:50:41 or they regulate it
01:50:43 like regular
01:50:45 like anything else
01:50:47 well it's hard to ban bitcoin
01:50:49 I don't think they can do that
01:50:51 I don't think they'll be able to
01:50:53 if two people
01:50:55 one guy has a thing and they accept bitcoin
01:50:57 another guy has bitcoin
01:50:59 what can the government do to stop that
01:51:01 transaction taking place
01:51:03 delete the apps
01:51:05 crack down on it
01:51:07 it's a little hard
01:51:09 bust in their door
01:51:11 they can ban that kind of thing
01:51:13 they ban child porn
01:51:15 and that's just
01:51:17 digital files that people trade
01:51:19 tyranny
01:51:21 tyranny
01:51:23 yeah
01:51:25 I mean they could make it illegal
01:51:27 I just don't think it would work
01:51:29 I don't think it would be enforceable
01:51:31 I think it would lessen
01:51:33 the amount of people using it openly
01:51:35 but like at this point
01:51:37 it'll happen no matter what
01:51:39 for a while at least
01:51:41 well I mean the same can be said about
01:51:43 almost any laws
01:51:45 there's always gonna be some people that
01:51:47 commit a crime and get away with it
01:51:49 yeah
01:51:51 I guess so yeah
01:51:53 I think it would
01:51:55 I think trying to ban it would just be
01:51:57 kind of like giving up
01:51:59 it's sort of like
01:52:01 drugs are illegal like marijuana was illegal
01:52:03 for a while
01:52:05 and it was like stupid because like the government
01:52:07 could have
01:52:09 they could have gotten
01:52:11 raised tax revenue
01:52:13 if they just made it legal
01:52:15 and like saleable
01:52:17 and regulated
01:52:19 making it illegal had no upsides
01:52:21 it was bad for
01:52:23 citizens and it was bad for
01:52:25 the government
01:52:27 and I feel like banning bitcoin would be the same
01:52:29 there's really no practical upside
01:52:31 to trying to ban it
01:52:33 yeah I wouldn't want them to ban bitcoin
01:52:35 but
01:52:37 I just feel like they might
01:52:39 if it threatens
01:52:41 them in any way
01:52:43 didn't China make it illegal
01:52:45 or something
01:52:47 China is cracking down on bitcoin
01:52:49 farming
01:52:51 yeah I think they banned bitcoin mining
01:52:53 maybe
01:52:55 because of the environmental impacts
01:52:57 oh no god knows
01:52:59 because they can't control it
01:53:01 they don't like that
01:53:03 you know China doesn't care about the
01:53:05 environment so it has to be
01:53:07 a different reason
01:53:09 sure well
01:53:11 yeah
01:53:13 I guess it's true
01:53:15 okay
01:53:17 that can't regulate it
01:53:19 okay I mean that makes sense
01:53:21 that tracks
01:53:23 damn I was looking at
01:53:25 covid case numbers in China
01:53:27 have you seen this shit
01:53:29 no
01:53:31 no
01:53:33 it's
01:53:35 covid case numbers
01:53:37 come on
01:53:39 come on please load
01:53:41 you fucking
01:53:43 hold on I'm finding the graph
01:53:45 it's
01:53:47 it's unreal
01:53:49 you're putting out graphs for this
01:53:51 it's gonna be pretty serious
01:53:53 it is serious
01:53:55 well it's seriously awesome
01:53:57 it isn't what it is
01:53:59 look at this
01:54:05 new cases 26
01:54:07 look at it
01:54:09 that's not much
01:54:11 what is the time
01:54:13 April
01:54:15 well this is from
01:54:17 is this the whole of covid or is this
01:54:19 this is since early
01:54:21 2020 when it started
01:54:23 so it started out
01:54:25 pretty bad in China
01:54:27 and then they were just like no
01:54:29 there's no covid
01:54:31 yeah but how do you know they aren't
01:54:33 lying and manipulating the data
01:54:35 yeah I guess
01:54:37 that's true
01:54:39 I guess I don't know
01:54:41 because they have
01:54:43 they have an incentive to lie
01:54:45 okay
01:54:47 well question
01:54:49 I guess it comes from official sources
01:54:51 official Chinese sources
01:54:53 there's a potential for them
01:54:55 to like say whatever number they want
01:54:57 do you think
01:54:59 maybe this is naive
01:55:01 do you think though that they could actually do
01:55:03 if they could do that
01:55:05 then why isn't every country doing that
01:55:07 lying about their case numbers
01:55:09 well I do think there's probably a lot of
01:55:11 countries that lie about case numbers
01:55:13 probably not just China
01:55:15 but I think in China
01:55:17 there's scrutiny for them since they
01:55:19 censor a lot of stuff
01:55:21 and you know they have a history of
01:55:23 manipulating data
01:55:25 other countries don't have the same kind of
01:55:27 history or the same kind of reputation
01:55:29 do you think
01:55:31 this graph is
01:55:33 is a
01:55:35 is a big fat lie
01:55:37 maybe it is
01:55:39 I don't know I mean there's no way for me to know
01:55:41 if it's true or not
01:55:43 I can't
01:55:45 to believe that it's been so
01:55:47 perfect but they maybe
01:55:49 have a lot of
01:55:51 mandates and curfews
01:55:53 easily enforceable
01:55:55 yeah
01:55:57 you will not go outside you will be shot
01:55:59 people will obey those sorts of
01:56:01 rules you can't say that in the UK
01:56:03 because people will say you can't shoot us
01:56:05 freedom
01:56:09 we want to just go outside and get COVID
01:56:11 we just want to get it
01:56:13 it certainly seems
01:56:15 plausible that
01:56:17 their kind of government could
01:56:19 you know perhaps achieve this
01:56:21 it's just really their
01:56:23 spotty track record when it comes to
01:56:25 being honest about stuff
01:56:27 that's the kind of
01:56:29 that's the only reason I would doubt
01:56:31 Xi Jinping is
01:56:33 very much like
01:56:35 I need to
01:56:37 look the coolest
01:56:39 I can't be seen to be weak
01:56:41 in any way we are the best
01:56:43 at getting rid of COVID it's plausible
01:56:45 that those lies going on
01:56:47 but I don't know can't tell
01:56:49 well
01:56:51 I just think it's a funny graph look at that shit
01:56:53 look how flat
01:56:55 I mean it'd be nice if it were
01:56:57 real you know I certainly
01:56:59 hope it is
01:57:01 I certainly hope those numbers are real
01:57:03 optimistically
01:57:05 yeah
01:57:07 I'll choose to believe it
01:57:09 oh Bitcoin
01:57:11 Bitcoin's under 60
01:57:13 it's under 60 oh no
01:57:15 it's not going up forever it doesn't
01:57:17 it doesn't only go up
01:57:19 gilf

01:57:57 you know NFT
01:57:59 I was trying to turn it into an NFT
01:58:01 but it doesn't work I know about NFTs
01:58:03 oh yeah I'm getting in
01:58:05 like to fungible token
01:58:07 yeah I'm selling some non fungible tokens

01:58:11 minting some NFTs
01:58:13 you can buy them on my
01:58:15 you can buy them on my website
01:58:17 they're called road to radcon
01:58:19 the book
01:58:21 it's a book
01:58:23 it's non fungible because it's physically
01:58:25 a real thing
01:58:27 atoms and molecules that make it up
01:58:29 in the real world you can't funge it
01:58:31 you can't do it
01:58:33 exactly
01:58:35 buy one and try to funge it
01:58:37 I have like 50 copies
01:58:39 I have about like 50 something
01:58:41 copies that I might never
01:58:43 sell
01:58:45 probably just gonna sit in a box
01:58:47 in my closet for the foreseeable
01:58:49 future
01:58:51 viewers please buy
01:58:53 the book from me
01:58:55 I don't need 50 copies
01:58:57 you need one copy or more
01:58:59 thank you
01:59:01 but the cover art
01:59:03 on that thing is pretty nice
01:59:05 I know it's so good
01:59:07 Michi's so good
01:59:09 shit rules man
01:59:11 yeah
01:59:13 shit rules
01:59:15 that's why it's my twitter icon
01:59:17 I've had it for my twitter avatar for couple months now
01:59:19 I think
01:59:21 no plans to get rid of it
01:59:25 there's the interior illustration
01:59:27 of me
01:59:29 looks even cooler than the one on the cover
01:59:31 I had to put it in there
01:59:33 along with a bunch of her other sketches
01:59:35 she did a bunch of like sketches
01:59:37 of the characters first and then she went back
01:59:39 and she like made the actual
01:59:41 piece arranged them all in you know
01:59:43 we went back and forth
01:59:45 on like what should Brad look like
01:59:47 what kind of expression
01:59:49 should he have
01:59:51 what sort of face is he making
01:59:53 etc
01:59:55 it's a masterpiece
01:59:57 I put it in
01:59:59 I put it in my pinned tweet
02:00:01 is ordering instructions
02:00:03 I've got a few more
02:00:05 people are buying it like one or two
02:00:07 every day or so
02:00:09 so it's not
02:00:11 I'm surprised
02:00:13 way more people want it
02:00:15 I thought maybe like 20 people
02:00:17 would want to buy a copy that didn't already
02:00:19 get one from the radcon rewards
02:00:21 but no it's probably been like 100
02:00:23 no maybe not 100
02:00:25 it's pretty good
02:00:27 well hopefully
02:00:29 you sent May here a copy right
02:00:31 I did
02:00:33 send May here a copy I put it in the mail yesterday
02:00:35 God forbid
02:00:37 you would have forgotten that
02:00:39 she said
02:00:41 send it to my parents and said okay
02:00:43 I guess I will
02:00:45 what else can I do
02:00:47 you're a man of honor
02:00:49 I'm amazed she still wanted it
02:00:51 honestly
02:00:53 you're a man of honor and integrity
02:00:55 so obviously you're gonna
02:00:57 fulfill any obligations you have
02:00:59 even to your mortal enemies
02:01:01 even to my mortal enemies
02:01:03 yes
02:01:05 we're bound by something
02:01:07 stronger than politics
02:01:09 we're bound by money
02:01:11 a monetary transaction took place
02:01:13 and it must be honored
02:01:15 at any cost
02:01:17 unfortunately
02:01:19 your honor is always stripped
02:01:21 away to zero every time you keep
02:01:23 stealing a scroll
02:01:25 you just can't help it
02:01:27 you have all this honor
02:01:29 you could be such an honorable samurai
02:01:31 but you keep stealing scrolls
02:01:33 I know I can't help myself
02:01:35 I'm a fiend
02:01:37 by the way
02:01:39 you guys probably already talked about
02:01:41 the doid gazers album
02:01:43 have you mentioned that here
02:01:45 we mentioned it
02:01:47 I think so
02:01:49 I haven't heard of an album
02:01:51 the doid gazers album
02:01:53 that was released by
02:01:55 doid gazer himself
02:01:57 was it
02:01:59 yeah that was um
02:02:01 that was uh
02:02:03 that was a while ago right
02:02:05 yeah I think that was quite a while ago
02:02:07 I remember
02:02:09 I remember yeah he made a voicemail
02:02:11 he gave us a voicemail about it I think
02:02:13 he has a twitter account
02:02:15 he made a doid gazers twitter account
02:02:17 I think he has the album
02:02:19 hold on
02:02:21 let me see if I can find it
02:02:25 oh no it's doid gazer
02:02:27 I just posted the album
02:02:29 you know I linked the album
02:02:31 oh there
02:02:35 what do you know
02:02:37 it's uh it's pretty funny
02:02:39 I quite liked it it's already at
02:02:41 over a thousand views which is not bad
02:02:43 for some brand new channel
02:02:45 I just started
02:02:47 I don't see the
02:02:49 the link on the
02:02:51 on the twitter account
02:02:53 uh
02:02:55 wait
02:02:57 oh it's on youtube okay
02:02:59 I thought it was a soundcloud album
02:03:01 yes yes this is just
02:03:03 this must be a collection of the
02:03:07 are these the voicemails
02:03:09 are these the voicemail songs or
02:03:11 hmm
02:03:13 I think
02:03:15 I think these are unique
02:03:17 but I'm not completely sure
02:03:19 Riley commented
02:03:21 did he
02:03:23 he says when you put it all this way
02:03:25 you make some good points
02:03:27 that's so funny
02:03:29 that comment doesn't really make a lot of sense
02:03:31 I don't know what he means
02:03:33 okay I guess
02:03:35 yeah
02:03:37 I quite liked it
02:03:39 and for some reason I was mentioned
02:03:41 in some of the lyrics
02:03:43 really
02:03:45 I guess I'm part of the
02:03:47 doid gazer
02:03:49 why is a stereos here
02:03:51 a stereos in the comments
02:03:53 I don't know what
02:03:55 two days ago
02:03:57 two days ago a stereos
02:03:59 commented
02:04:01 a stereos says avoid the doid
02:04:03 he steals pizzas
02:04:05 I didn't see that
02:04:07 doid gazer responds
02:04:09 and the rumor also my fiance
02:04:11 better than your fiance
02:04:17 oh my god
02:04:19 this guy is sick
02:04:21 this guy is twisted
02:04:23 I assumed these were the same songs
02:04:25 from the voicemails
02:04:27 but if they're new ones
02:04:29 then I guess I gotta listen to them again
02:04:31 oops
02:04:33 I think it might be all new material
02:04:35 because
02:04:37 I don't recognize the voicemails
02:04:39 I heard in any of the songs
02:04:41 and
02:04:43 personally I feel like
02:04:45 they should have included some of the voicemails
02:04:47 in this album
02:04:49 because some of the voicemails
02:04:51 were really good
02:04:53 I really like them
02:04:55 he says special thanks to Tom Oliver
02:04:57 I'm not sure why
02:04:59 I'm not sure what Tom did
02:05:01 something
02:05:03 helpful I guess
02:05:05 he made a 3D avatar
02:05:07 for them
02:05:09 probably
02:05:15 hey
02:05:17 we've been going for about two hours now
02:05:19 speaking of voicemails
02:05:21 what do you think about if we start voicemails
02:05:23 do you think it's about that time
02:05:25 pretty good with that
02:05:27 well let's
02:05:29 let's fucking do it then
02:05:31 let me grab the first one here
02:05:33 the first one
02:05:35 let's go through this
02:05:37 three hours of voicemails
02:05:39 there's not
02:05:41 there's less than one page of voicemails this week
02:05:43 so it should be a pretty normal amount
02:05:45 okay
02:05:47 here's the voicemail and also there's a link
02:05:49 okay
02:05:51 whatever
02:05:53 the voicemail is called read die dark
02:05:55 3, 2, 1, go
02:05:59 yo if you guys haven't already
02:06:01 totally check out the manga die dark
02:06:03 by Q Hayashida
02:06:05 she's most known for like Dora Hedoro
02:06:07 which is had an anime adaptation somewhat recently
02:06:09 but this is her new series
02:06:11 it's fucking cool
02:06:13 everyone in it is like a fucking weirdo
02:06:15 irreverent
02:06:17 sociopath or something
02:06:19 but they're all just kind of
02:06:21 going around space
02:06:23 and there's a funny skeleton robot man
02:06:25 so Gib would probably fucking love that shit
02:06:27 and the artwork's great so check that shit out
02:06:29 okay
02:06:31 does the link show the thing?
02:06:33 here's the link
02:06:35 oh
02:06:37 whoa
02:06:39 that looks pretty cool
02:06:41 that's pretty neat
02:06:43 that's a skeleton astronaut
02:06:45 with a pillar of skeletons
02:06:47 I'm sold
02:06:49 this guy looks like he's
02:06:51 boned
02:06:55 true? true?
02:06:57 boned as in like unfortunate
02:06:59 circumstances that led to
02:07:01 bad things to happen to this character
02:07:03 boned?
02:07:05 possibly
02:07:07 the next voicemail
02:07:09 dude we're boned we're gonna die
02:07:11 that's what I think that means
02:07:13 maybe he already did
02:07:15 next voicemail is an image
02:07:17 there it is
02:07:21 so the next voicemail isn't a voicemail
02:07:23 it's a voicemail
02:07:25 okay
02:07:27 it's a visual mail
02:07:29 it's the f
02:07:31 the f show
02:07:33 I think it's a p maybe it's the
02:07:35 procrastinator show okay so I think this is me and you
02:07:37 we're being showered with money
02:07:41 and then okay
02:07:43 I've wasted my life on studying
02:07:45 could have been a youtuber
02:07:47 good work kid
02:07:49 the government will pay you
02:07:51 I'm gonna study some more
02:07:53 forget youtube
02:07:55 I'll be a scientist
02:07:57 true story compliments please
02:07:59 wait
02:08:05 alright so this character
02:08:07 this orange character
02:08:09 is the voicemailer
02:08:11 true story
02:08:13 he's got fly honey
02:08:15 he's got fly honey sciences bitches now
02:08:17 I'm jealous
02:08:19 if he becomes a scientist

02:09:03 teaming with jealousy
02:09:05 about all our success
02:09:07 as everyone does all the time
02:09:09 but then
02:09:11 he copes

02:09:15 the government is paying me

02:16:19 it's alright it is good honestly
02:16:21 I'm getting sick of the uh
02:16:23 the American girl
02:16:25 parody parody
02:16:27 I've had enough of it
02:16:29 um yeah please
02:16:31 what you should do
02:16:33 is you should start every um
02:16:35 you should start every episode with a different pun
02:16:37 you know nobody has ever done that before
02:16:39 too hard
02:16:41 too hard
02:16:43 for me
02:16:45 um
02:16:47 where's my next voicemail
02:16:49 yeah I guess that would require way too much effort
02:16:51 for this uh
02:16:53 too much work
02:16:55 oh wait okay the next one is
02:16:57 get good one piece
02:16:59 and then there's an image link

02:17:07 okay yeah
02:17:09 there's 4,000 episodes
02:17:11 no that's 4,000 for Sesame Street
02:17:13 episodes of Sesame Street
02:17:15 didn't know that
02:17:17 so they had they been continually going
02:17:19 since it started
02:17:21 yeah probably
02:17:23 how many fucking seasons is that
02:17:25 I guess seasons is strange
02:17:27 I don't even know when it started
02:17:29 I guess they've been going longer than the Simpsons
02:17:33 no wait
02:17:35 maybe
02:17:37 51 seasons oh my god
02:17:39 51?
02:17:41 69 started
02:17:43 it definitely started before the Simpsons
02:17:45 the Simpsons started in like
02:17:47 1988 I think
02:17:49 yeah
02:17:51 maybe um yeah
02:17:53 close to the 90s
02:17:55 cool well
02:17:57 good good good job
02:17:59 next one is uh
02:18:01 we should marathon Sesame Street and talk about it
02:18:03 we do a
02:18:05 let's watch Sesame Street
02:18:07 a live reaction to every episode
02:18:09 how many
02:18:11 I want to figure out how many
02:18:13 hours that would be
02:18:15 okay next next one is
02:18:17 uh another fucking
02:18:19 thing
02:18:21 another image
02:18:23 okay third world or brain
02:18:25 surgery agriculture
02:18:27 chemistry romance warfare philosophy
02:18:29 seafaring art
02:18:31 first world or brains Pokemon
02:18:33 weed Chris Chan
02:18:35 I
02:18:37 I don't know if this is accurate
02:18:39 so is that supposed to be
02:18:41 me, Trixie and Ben
02:18:43 I
02:18:45 I think it's mage, you, Trixie, me
02:18:49 I don't think about Pokemon
02:18:51 I don't even like it
02:18:53 they got it wrong
02:18:55 wait uh mage is a third worlder
02:18:57 I mean not
02:18:59 I mean the Lithuania is not
02:19:01 Lithuania is not third world
02:19:03 it's it's it's not
02:19:05 like a powerhouse of
02:19:07 of Europe but it's like
02:19:09 she had she had shitty she had
02:19:11 shitty dubs she had shitty anime
02:19:13 dubs
02:19:15 that definitely sounds like
02:19:17 a third world to me I guess
02:19:19 nightmare that's second world
02:19:21 second life
02:19:23 okay yeah true
02:19:25 I don't know
02:19:27 I don't know if this is like supposed to be a serious
02:19:29 point that I feel like I
02:19:31 don't know if I can even
02:19:33 I want to I feel this makes me mad
02:19:35 this makes me want to argue but I don't
02:19:37 even know where to begin
02:19:39 so I think
02:19:41 it's a mage head
02:19:43 mage is always
02:19:45 always going on about
02:19:47 the nuances of chemistry
02:19:49 things on our streams
02:19:51 on our vtuber streams
02:19:53 we probably executed her and that's why
02:19:55 she's no longer on the show anymore
02:19:57 that was a big mistake
02:19:59 if you don't
02:20:01 know anything about Christian
02:20:03 then you can't be part of the
02:20:05 procrastinator's podcast
02:20:07 mmm that's
02:20:09 that's me I'm just always I'm just always
02:20:11 thinking about thinking about Chris
02:20:13 Christian
02:20:15 is the glue that holds this
02:20:17 whole thing together
02:20:19 my fucking
02:20:21 my weird my weird little hair lick
02:20:23 I don't like it I don't like

02:20:55 they put the mic so hard
02:20:57 I couldn't hear what they were saying

02:21:03 versus squid game
02:21:05 well I haven't seen
02:21:07 no I haven't seen either one
02:21:09 I may I may
02:21:11 watch some squid game at some point
02:21:13 it looks mildly interesting
02:21:15 I might give it a chance
02:21:17 I've heard a lot
02:21:19 about squid game
02:21:21 but haven't watched it either
02:21:23 nah here's what you do
02:21:25 here's fucking sesame street
02:21:27 versus squid game
02:21:29 I think sesame street versus squid
02:21:31 I have been
02:21:33 a lot of people have been telling me
02:21:35 to watch odd taxi and I have dug my heels
02:21:37 in and made it a
02:21:39 point of pride no I will never
02:21:41 I will never watch odd
02:21:43 taxi it's a part
02:21:45 of my identity now
02:21:47 Ben is not much of a movie watcher
02:21:49 he doesn't watch movies ever
02:21:51 not really
02:21:53 not really
02:21:55 okay
02:21:57 next one
02:21:59 although I mean we don't know what our next bonus episode
02:22:01 is going to be so we'll have to
02:22:03 think about it
02:22:05 it should probably be more trick
02:22:07 scene and yug stuff right
02:22:09 oh no
02:22:11 those are always the best ones
02:22:13 there's nothing else to say about that
02:22:15 ooh she said I'm transphobic
02:22:17 she said it's transphobia that I don't like her
02:22:19 it's the only reason she can think of
02:22:21 okay that's it
02:22:23 that's all I have to say that's the bonus episode
02:22:25 that's the goss
02:22:27 we just do that for like two or three hours
02:22:29 just see
02:22:31 just cope and seal about it for three hours
02:22:33 ah yeah
02:22:35 next voicemail
02:22:37 is there it is it is called
02:22:39 uh
02:22:41 it's it's
02:22:43 it's like bleep it's like you know
02:22:45 dollar sign
02:22:47 percentage hashtag
02:22:49 ampersand oid gazers
02:22:51 three two one go
02:22:53 hey it's me
02:22:55 rectoid gazes
02:22:57 I look at the butthole
02:22:59 what
02:23:01 rectoid
02:23:03 rectoid
02:23:05 sure
02:23:07 rectoid
02:23:09 is that a word
02:23:11 is it is it like
02:23:13 metroid
02:23:15 rectoid
02:23:17 I guess he's talking like
02:23:19 he's combined rectum with void gazers
02:23:21 with doid gazers sure
02:23:23 rectoid okay
02:23:25 I get it I guess
02:23:27 uh by the way I just
02:23:29 want to say sesame street episodes
02:23:31 were one hour long
02:23:33 each really from
02:23:35 1969 to 2015
02:23:37 and then they changed to 30 minutes
02:23:39 really wow that's uh
02:23:41 yeah that's pretty long so
02:23:43 so if I get
02:23:45 44,000 hours
02:23:47 of sesame street content
02:23:49 I don't know
02:23:51 how they can do it that sounds
02:23:53 uh
02:23:55 quite frankly it sounds like torture to me
02:24:01 I think if you want to
02:24:03 terrorize if you want to torture a terrorist
02:24:05 to find out the location of their
02:24:07 secret lair just just play
02:24:09 sesame street for 44,000 hours
02:24:11 so it's something we should
02:24:13 be doing more of is torture
02:24:15 yeah we should do that in one ton
02:24:17 500
02:24:19 mm-hmm
02:24:21 it'll take me a second to figure out
02:24:23 how many episodes were
02:24:25 pre um changed to 30 minutes
02:24:27 oh

02:27:25 a financial genius after all
02:27:27 this is so funny
02:27:29 scrolling through the fucking muppet
02:27:31 wickier
02:27:33 lister stress me street episodes
02:27:35 mm-hmm it's just it just keeps
02:27:37 going season one season two
02:27:39 three four five six seven eight nine
02:27:41 what 40
02:27:43 41 season 43
02:27:45 they've got to all be basically the same right
02:27:47 like how many how many
02:27:49 they write so many fucking
02:27:51 I would imagine how many different
02:27:53 they probably even do
02:27:55 yeah yeah
02:27:57 they probably repeated themselves several
02:27:59 thousand times well they
02:28:01 they do they do reuse
02:28:03 like animation animated bits
02:28:05 and skits right like
02:28:07 like an episode of sesame street will have
02:28:09 like recycled content from older episodes
02:28:11 in it I think
02:28:13 so it's I don't think it's all like completely
02:28:15 original content
02:28:17 every episode I don't know I couldn't tell you
02:28:19 I haven't watched it
02:28:21 I've never seen it so I have no idea you never
02:28:23 watched it even as a kid I did watch it
02:28:25 um it
02:28:27 yeah I I've never saw it
02:28:29 I think I must have seen
02:28:31 like a couple episodes when I was
02:28:33 really young because I remember big bird
02:28:35 and grow and Oscar the Grouch
02:28:37 sure but I wasn't like it wasn't like a normal
02:28:39 thing
02:28:41 the normal thing was telly tubbies
02:28:43 and then did they
02:28:45 have a like I was too old
02:28:47 for telly tubbies when it came out so
02:28:49 did they have a weird baby
02:28:51 thing did they have a UK version
02:28:53 of the sesame street over there
02:28:55 no no
02:28:57 they just aired the thing as far as I
02:28:59 understand yeah it's the same show
02:29:01 I'm surprised they didn't just have
02:29:03 the sesame street with like
02:29:05 British accents
02:29:07 no
02:29:09 no that would be
02:29:11 like imagine if they
02:29:13 British Muppets
02:29:15 imagine if they just use the same footage
02:29:17 but they dubbed over it
02:29:19 with British accents
02:29:21 same word the exact same words
02:29:23 is someone with a British accent
02:29:25 same language just
02:29:27 big birds like
02:29:29 grover
02:29:31 me chimney me chimneys on fire
02:29:33 grover
02:29:35 I don't know what a British people say
02:29:37 fish and chips shrimp on the barbie
02:29:39 yeah they like
02:29:41 over like put like acid
02:29:43 wash and air PNG
02:29:45 fucking fish and chips over whatever
02:29:47 they were actually eating in the footage
02:29:49 they just dubbed the names of the food
02:29:51 you know sometimes
02:29:53 with video games
02:29:55 they actually released a different English
02:29:57 version for the UK audience
02:29:59 just to have the different spellings
02:30:01 and stuff they did it with
02:30:03 them with apescape
02:30:05 I know I know they did I know they
02:30:07 did that with apescape they just gave it a different
02:30:09 dub in America and the UK
02:30:11 for some reason yeah did they
02:30:13 I thought I thought the
02:30:15 you know they did the dub of
02:30:17 apescape 2 oh no yeah in apescape 1
02:30:19 I was thinking of apescape 2
02:30:21 because in apescape 2 for some reason
02:30:23 both all of the English
02:30:25 dub is the
02:30:27 the European English British version
02:30:29 I learned I learned that
02:30:31 I learned that fact from you
02:30:33 from your apescape yeah I did I wasn't thinking
02:30:35 of the first game yeah yeah
02:30:37 I remember that video that was a
02:30:39 pretty interesting video

02:31:39 bat when the chips are down and you got to
02:31:41 kill that civilian in GTA 5
02:31:43 Nate is a type of guy to never be
02:31:45 on the procrastinator's podcast
02:31:47 that's that's for sure
02:31:49 true though
02:31:51 true next
02:31:53 voicemail is called cheese
02:31:55 three two one
02:31:57 go
02:31:59 okay Ben
02:32:01 I bought me some cheese
02:32:03 and I bought a block of Swiss cheese
02:32:05 from the store
02:32:07 I just kind of suckled on it
02:32:09 it slowly fell apart in my mouth it was
02:32:11 wonderful
02:32:13 what?
02:32:15 that's not how you're supposed to do it
02:32:17 it's kind of gross
02:32:19 yeah
02:32:21 it's almost as gross as putting olive oil
02:32:23 in your ear and then letting all the goo
02:32:25 liquify out and it's
02:32:27 blew just out of your mouth
02:32:29 it's almost as gross as that
02:32:31 medicine is not always
02:32:33 medicine just sometimes is weird
02:32:35 feels good when it's over
02:32:37 what if you poured
02:32:39 I would never do that recreationally
02:32:41 do it for fun
02:32:43 I would deliberately get some ear wax
02:32:45 so I can drip some olive oil in there
02:32:47 satisfying
02:32:49 what if you poured hot cheese down your ear
02:32:51 that would be a
02:32:53 problem
02:32:55 I feel like it would leave your
02:32:57 doesn't it leave the inside of your ear
02:32:59 feeling oily like does it eventually
02:33:01 go away get absorbed by your skin or whatever
02:33:03 nah it just slips out
02:33:05 I mean your skin is oily
02:33:07 yeah I guess so
02:33:09 gross
02:33:11 wait
02:33:13 wait oh the baby bell

02:33:23 but I've started to kind of hate them
02:33:25 I find them a little bit disgusting now

02:33:29 I'll try to eat one and I'm like

02:33:47 I'm spoiled
02:33:49 on it I guess
02:33:51 I'm gonna have to
02:33:53 I'm gonna have to wait
02:33:55 I'm gonna have to wait a while before I get another one

02:34:53 it is called
02:34:55 where is it here it's called
02:34:57 oh my god please
02:34:59 please it's called
02:35:01 geese are heartless creatures
02:35:03 there it is three two one
02:35:05 go
02:35:07 you ever look at a goose and think
02:35:09 what a vile creature
02:35:11 hmm
02:35:13 you know they're constantly hissing
02:35:15 and honking and those sounds
02:35:17 aren't so pleasant and
02:35:19 you know they got scary teeth
02:35:21 and
02:35:23 evil looking eyes you know
02:35:25 one of them once looked me dead in the
02:35:27 eyes and said
02:35:29 mister you have
02:35:31 you have waving hair
02:35:33 waving goodbye on account
02:35:35 of you going bald
02:35:37 and I felt
02:35:39 that made me very upset
02:35:41 why did it
02:35:43 why did they do this
02:35:45 why did they say that to me I don't
02:35:47 like them they're very rude
02:35:49 why are they so rude
02:35:51 why are geese so rude
02:35:53 I'm sorry that happened
02:35:55 why do we allow
02:35:57 these geese to exist
02:35:59 why don't we just ring them
02:36:01 by the neck and toss them about
02:36:03 you know
02:36:05 rough them up a bit
02:36:07 I don't like geese
02:36:09 what do you think about geese
02:36:11 it sounds like they need to be cancelled
02:36:13 if you ask me
02:36:17 I think
02:36:19 I don't know
02:36:21 I've never had a bad experience
02:36:23 with a goose so
02:36:25 I don't know I'm sorry
02:36:27 I had one long time ago
02:36:29 when I was small enough that they could
02:36:31 be taller than me if they
02:36:33 stretched their neck up
02:36:35 and they charged at me
02:36:37 and I ran
02:36:39 what do you mean they how many
02:36:41 where why
02:36:43 it was a school trip
02:36:45 actually
02:36:47 at some like Roman
02:36:49 thing
02:36:51 there's roman ruins
02:36:53 it's like look at that
02:36:55 you went to Rome
02:36:57 no in England the romes
02:36:59 they came and they conquered
02:37:01 England they put all this roman shit everywhere
02:37:03 so there's like a few roman stuff
02:37:05 like museums and things
02:37:07 sure sure
02:37:09 I remember the trip vividly for some reason
02:37:11 but then at the end
02:37:13 we were getting on the bus to go back
02:37:15 to school and I was just sort of
02:37:17 wandering around
02:37:19 and the geese said how are you gonna be late
02:37:21 you gotta go back to school and they started honking me
02:37:23 and I was like no I don't want to go there
02:37:25 and they nipped
02:37:27 at my heels
02:37:29 fascinating
02:37:31 I've never really had a goose experience
02:37:33 beyond that point
02:37:35 I hear geese can be dangerous at times
02:37:37 sometimes they get violent and they attack you
02:37:39 they sometimes can get aggressive
02:37:41 they can be
02:37:43 I've never heard of anyone being killed by a geese
02:37:45 but it's probably happened
02:37:47 you get your eye bit out if you're an idiot
02:37:49 probably a kid
02:37:51 a kid has been killed by multiple geese
02:37:53 like attacking them at some point
02:37:55 I could totally see that
02:37:57 I remember
02:37:59 there was an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm
02:38:01 where Larry kills a goose
02:38:07 it was like a pet goose
02:38:09 of the guy who owns a lodge
02:38:11 and the goose
02:38:13 just went up to him while he was playing golf
02:38:15 and started attacking him
02:38:17 so
02:38:19 Larry had a golf club
02:38:21 and he just took a swung at the goose
02:38:23 and the goose died
02:38:25 he took a swing
02:38:27 they got long necks
02:38:29 you know what to aim for
02:38:31 you gotta do
02:38:33 then he had to hatch a plan
02:38:35 to find a way to bury
02:38:37 the body of the goose without
02:38:39 the guy finding out
02:38:41 of course
02:38:43 because if the guy finds out
02:38:45 he'll be banned from the lodge
02:38:47 or whatever he was in
02:38:49 yeah sure
02:38:51 you gotta do
02:38:53 you gotta do Robert Pattinson
02:38:55 in the lighthouse
02:38:57 you see that movie
02:38:59 the lighthouse
02:39:01 he grabs
02:39:03 a seagull
02:39:05 by the neck and he starts swinging it
02:39:07 and just like bashes it against
02:39:09 like a well or something
02:39:11 he just smashes the fuck
02:39:13 out of that seagull
02:39:15 I guess geese are kind of big
02:39:17 it might be kind of hard to do it to a goose
02:39:19 but birds are light
02:39:21 they have little brittle hollow bones
02:39:23 so maybe you could
02:39:25 I could probably lift a goose
02:39:27 you can probably kill one pretty easily
02:39:29 with a golf club
02:39:31 sure
02:39:33 how heavy is a goose
02:39:35 how
02:39:37 how heavy is a goose
02:39:43 I finished the
02:39:45 Sesame Street calculations
02:39:47 yes
02:39:49 after this goose thing
02:39:51 geese are apparently
02:39:53 Canadian geese can be up to like 14 pounds
02:39:55 which is
02:39:57 I mean it's not that
02:39:59 that's quite expensive
02:40:01 it seems like most kind of goose
02:40:03 are about
02:40:05 4 to 6 pounds
02:40:07 up to like 7
02:40:09 but I guess maybe Canadian geese are bigger
02:40:11 that's the most
02:40:13 common kind that I usually see
02:40:15 there should be no problem for you
02:40:17 since you can lift like what
02:40:19 150 pounds now
02:40:21 my bench press
02:40:23 my bench press is coming along
02:40:25 my bench press is 150 now
02:40:27 if I can get it over 155
02:40:29 that was my old
02:40:31 not my old record
02:40:33 but before Covid
02:40:35 I was benching like 155
02:40:37 so if I can get over that
02:40:39 yes I'm strong now
02:40:41 so pretty soon you'll be able to take on geese
02:40:43 and also are
02:40:45 you know Riley in a boxing match
02:40:47 finally
02:40:49 yeah
02:40:51 I think feel like me and Riley
02:40:53 would be
02:40:55 I don't know who would win
02:40:57 I feel like we would both do very badly
02:40:59 in a boxing match
02:41:01 I don't know who would be worse
02:41:03 you need to get strong enough to be able
02:41:05 to penetrate the defensive barrier
02:41:07 of his gun
02:41:09 right
02:41:11 the gun fight
02:41:13 okay funny
02:41:15 May messaged me
02:41:17 after you know Riley said the thing about
02:41:19 the break in never happened
02:41:21 I didn't respond because I don't
02:41:23 want to talk to her
02:41:25 but she DM'd me on Twitter being like
02:41:27 Riley is just trying to start another
02:41:29 gun fight it was the only time
02:41:31 that like you know them
02:41:33 the yig crew has been relevant
02:41:35 and I just think it's really funny
02:41:37 that she group first to her husband
02:41:39 as the gun
02:41:41 it's his gun
02:41:43 that's the gun the titular gun
02:41:45 is your husband why are you calling it that
02:41:49 I guess they're not married but you know what I mean
02:41:51 very funny
02:41:53 I don't know
02:41:55 okay so
02:41:57 Sesame Street yes
02:41:59 there are Sesame Street facts
02:42:01 there is a bunch
02:42:03 I calculated
02:42:05 2017 when they
02:42:07 change to 30 minutes
02:42:11 I mean it was
02:42:13 I did all the mathematics
02:42:15 we have 4,917
02:42:17 hours approximately
02:42:19 of Sesame Street
02:42:21 now dividing that by
02:42:23 24
02:42:25 if you were to watch it 24 hours straight
02:42:27 204.8 days
02:42:29 straight of watching Sesame Street
02:42:31 which is unrealistic because you can't
02:42:33 stay awake and watch the entire thing
02:42:35 so
02:42:37 let's say the average time to be
02:42:39 awake is like 14 hours per day
02:42:41 you take that
02:42:43 you watch Sesame Street for those entire 14 hours
02:42:45 and you will be done
02:42:47 watching Sesame Street
02:42:49 after 351.2 days
02:42:51 almost an entire
02:42:53 full year
02:42:55 you could do it as your full time
02:42:57 job for a year
02:42:59 and maybe you'd get done watching Sesame Street
02:43:01 14 hours a day yes
02:43:05 I mean that's more than a full time job
02:43:07 that's
02:43:09 double basically because full time is like 8 hours
02:43:11 a day right
02:43:13 yeah and no weekends
02:43:15 so
02:43:17 slave labor conditions
02:43:19 make like I don't know
02:43:21 Quinton Reviews style
02:43:23 Sesame Street review
02:43:25 like the sort of videos
02:43:27 you see like
02:43:29 Jenny Nicholson I watched all of something
02:43:31 yes yes
02:43:33 if you wanted to do that it would take an entire year
02:43:35 at best
02:43:37 think of the views though
02:43:39 think of the views think of the amount of times
02:43:41 you could say I watched all of Sesame Street
02:43:43 so you don't have to
02:43:45 I'm a nostalgia critic
02:43:47 I was gonna say you'd probably be like the only person
02:43:49 ever but that's probably not true
02:43:51 probably someone somewhere
02:43:53 honest
02:43:55 I don't know I mean it's been on since the 60's
02:43:57 all of the kids
02:43:59 wouldn't have kept watching it
02:44:01 all of the kids are dead now
02:44:03 that used to watch it back then
02:44:05 I'm sure there's one
02:44:07 there's at least one kid who is autistic
02:44:09 enough to watch the entire thing
02:44:11 that's what I was gonna say yeah I could believe
02:44:13 that there was maybe some kid who was like
02:44:15 who was profoundly autistic or something
02:44:17 he liked Sesame Street a lot
02:44:19 and he just never stopped watching it
02:44:21 even now
02:44:23 I could believe
02:44:25 I need psychopedic knowledge
02:44:27 they should make a youtube video about it
02:44:29 he even goes out of his way to watch all the episodes
02:44:31 he missed
02:44:33 finding them wherever he can online
02:44:35 he DVRs them
02:44:37 yeah
02:44:39 next voicemail
02:44:41 we've only got a few more
02:44:43 I think
02:44:45 oh yeah there's only two more
02:44:47 the next one is called
02:44:49 my
02:44:51 computer
02:44:53 why does it do this
02:44:55 it's when I click a file until I click and drag it
02:44:57 sometimes it just stops
02:44:59 understanding what I'm trying to do and then I have to click a different window
02:45:01 I don't know what's going on with my UI
02:45:03 lately
02:45:05 right
02:45:07 it's called my revenge
02:45:09 three two one go
02:45:11 hey man
02:45:13 last week you called me a fucking idiot
02:45:15 because my voicemails are too quiet
02:45:17 well
02:45:19 what I have to say to that
02:45:21 in response is
02:45:23 am I loud enough for you now
02:45:25 is this what you wanted
02:45:27 yeah thank you
02:45:29 yes thank you
02:45:31 that was a good say
02:45:33 towards the end there kind of sounded
02:45:35 like an ego raptor impression
02:45:37 hmm
02:45:39 maybe
02:45:41 maybe a little bit
02:45:43 oh
02:45:45 this is um
02:45:47 this is not really relevant to anything
02:45:49 but I guess it's funny enough that I could mention it
02:45:51 I had to explain
02:45:53 the PCP
02:45:55 to two of my roommates yesterday
02:45:57 they know
02:45:59 they now know that I am a
02:46:01 YouTube podcaster
02:46:03 so that's cringe
02:46:05 that's horrible
02:46:07 I know
02:46:09 I know please give me condolences
02:46:11 I was walking home
02:46:13 from the printer
02:46:15 I had just gone to the printer to get the second batch
02:46:17 of road to rad cons
02:46:19 printed and I had the box
02:46:21 and I was walking and one of the guys
02:46:23 he was sitting outside
02:46:25 like sketching something in a sketchbook
02:46:27 and I asked him hey
02:46:29 what's your sketch and he showed me
02:46:31 and he was like what you got there
02:46:33 and I was like well
02:46:35 I had to explain
02:46:37 what road to radcon is
02:46:39 which entailed
02:46:41 talking about the PCP
02:46:43 and stuff and then I came inside
02:46:45 and another guy was inside and he also was like
02:46:47 hey what you got there and I was like
02:46:49 well gotta tell you about it
02:46:51 he asked me like what's the podcast
02:46:53 you don't have to explain everything
02:46:55 well yeah he asked me about it
02:46:57 he asked me to explain so what am I gonna say
02:46:59 no if you want to know all this
02:47:01 I'll tell you
02:47:03 he's a P on YouTube he saw my little icon
02:47:05 he said congratulations
02:47:07 for me because he saw that I'm almost at
02:47:09 20k subscribers
02:47:11 which is pretty cool I guess
02:47:13 he thought that was neat and I said no
02:47:15 it's embarrassing no it's a stupid no
02:47:17 I hate myself no please kill me
02:47:19 and this charade please
02:47:21 and then he was like
02:47:23 gladly
02:47:25 yeah
02:47:27 and he cut out his glock and he shot
02:47:29 ok alright
02:47:31 so that was
02:47:33 that was funny
02:47:35 alright last
02:47:37 last voicemail
02:47:39 it is called
02:47:41 it is called ideas 5 months
02:47:43 late
02:47:45 3 2 1 go
02:47:47 back in episode 261
02:47:49 Ben said why schedule protests
02:47:51 what do protests do if they don't disrupt anything
02:47:53 and for a bit of a nitpick schedule protests
02:47:55 still close down roads and make people take
02:47:57 alternate ways around town
02:47:59 for some people
02:48:01 you're probably not being put in a protest cage
02:48:03 in the middle of nowhere but the broader idea
02:48:05 I'd like to discuss is how should protests
02:48:07 be tackled in an ideal world
02:48:09 not all protests are for good movements like
02:48:11 civil rights, trans rights, BLM pro-units etc
02:48:13 there's anti-abortion, anti-lockdown
02:48:15 and anti-democratic stuff too
02:48:17 should the rest of society allow these to be
02:48:19 unrestricted disrupting large parts
02:48:21 of society because 1% of the population
02:48:23 thinks vaccines will make them sterile
02:48:25 hmm
02:48:27 well it's simple
02:48:29 the stupid protests
02:48:31 should be destroyed
02:48:33 ban them, ban the ones that are bad
02:48:35 and
02:48:37 fund the ones that are good
02:48:39 cops are good when they're
02:48:41 when they're cracking down on
02:48:43 people that I don't like
02:48:45 um
02:48:47 I think
02:48:49 well I mean uh jeez
02:48:51 I guess people should be
02:48:53 I guess people should be
02:48:55 allowed to protest
02:48:57 even things that are bad
02:48:59 I guess I wouldn't say no they can't do that
02:49:01 uh
02:49:03 yeah you just count a protest
02:49:05 with another
02:49:07 bunch of people
02:49:09 the same argument people use about
02:49:11 freedom of speech and stuff like that
02:49:15 well freedom of speech is good
02:49:17 actually
02:49:19 uh
02:49:21 you know I meant
02:49:23 there's like the mayoral race
02:49:25 going on in Boston right now
02:49:27 and um
02:49:29 one of the contenders
02:49:31 who I think just got endorsed by
02:49:33 the Boston Globe
02:49:35 which I think is kind of a big deal
02:49:37 uh
02:49:39 Michelle Wu is uh
02:49:41 I don't know if she's the frontrunner or what
02:49:43 but I met her
02:49:45 I literally met her outside of the
02:49:47 Boba Tea place
02:49:49 no it was the Waffle Pop
02:49:51 place that I went with
02:49:53 munchie and kazi a couple times
02:49:55 and
02:49:57 she was just standing out there with like a little entourage
02:49:59 handing out cards
02:50:01 and she asked me like hey
02:50:03 what would you like me to do
02:50:05 as mayor and I was like
02:50:07 uh hey remember that
02:50:09 straight pride protest that they approved
02:50:11 uh don't do that anymore
02:50:13 and she was like
02:50:15 yeah okay that was dumb
02:50:17 uh
02:50:19 so if she becomes mayor
02:50:21 and then and banned
02:50:23 straight pride parades it was my fault
02:50:25 I did it
02:50:27 uh
02:50:29 yeah so what was I
02:50:31 what was I even talking about
02:50:33 um
02:50:35 you were just saying before that
02:50:37 you would allow all parades now you're saying
02:50:39 you want certain ones not to be allowed
02:50:41 it's not okay the thing
02:50:43 about the straight pride parade is that it was not
02:50:45 merely allowed that it was like
02:50:47 official like it was like
02:50:49 the cops showed up to like
02:50:51 they cordoned off a parade route for it
02:50:53 and the cops were there
02:50:55 to escort
02:50:57 it and keep
02:50:59 people from
02:51:01 fucking them up
02:51:03 yeah it's
02:51:05 a movement that doesn't
02:51:07 really warrant a parade because
02:51:09 it's only
02:51:11 a backlash against gay pride
02:51:13 like you wouldn't do a parade
02:51:15 unless you were trying to
02:51:17 make a statement
02:51:19 yes true but
02:51:21 I guess a parade is not the same thing as a protest
02:51:23 I would I mean
02:51:25 if like I wouldn't say like they're not
02:51:27 allowed to like drive their float
02:51:29 down the street or whatever like they have the same right
02:51:31 to drive a truck down the road
02:51:33 as anyone else but like it's different when it's like
02:51:35 okay this is an official thing
02:51:37 like the city is like announcing that it's an event
02:51:39 we've given you like an official police
02:51:41 escort like that's not
02:51:43 that's not freedom of speech
02:51:45 that's not freedom of speech
02:51:47 that's like
02:51:49 you know that's
02:51:51 the government endorsing it
02:51:53 basically the local government
02:51:55 is getting involved it's like
02:51:57 state sanctioned stuff
02:51:59 like imagine like an
02:52:01 lgb parade
02:52:03 right without the t
02:52:05 deliberately and that's the
02:52:07 it's like oh it's like this is
02:52:09 the face of the
02:52:11 you know the city or the mayor or whatever
02:52:13 it's like this is what they're allowing
02:52:15 pretty much pretty much
02:52:17 without the t that sounds like
02:52:19 then saint to me
02:52:21 what
02:52:23 you're saying that I'm lesbian gay bisexual
02:52:25 I'm saying you're you're you're saying
02:52:27 you're on t
02:52:29 got it
02:52:31 somebody else
02:52:33 spider if you're
02:52:35 you call spider on twitter called me low t
02:52:37 because
02:52:39 because I told him my lifts
02:52:41 I told him my lift numbers and he wasn't
02:52:43 super he wasn't impressed
02:52:45 okay it's true though
02:52:47 I am it's you're also
02:52:49 you're also anti-t though
02:52:51 you know as far as trans
02:52:53 is concerned because
02:52:55 remember Trixie
02:52:57 what you said yeah
02:52:59 I remember I remember
02:53:01 I remember it like it was only yesterday
02:53:03 when she said I'm a girl now and I said well
02:53:05 I hate you for that reason and that was
02:53:07 that was what happened
02:53:09 that's how I remember it
02:53:11 you're both low t and anti-t
02:53:13 yes true
02:53:15 my two favorite things about me
02:53:17 anyway
02:53:19 protest I mean
02:53:21 fucking
02:53:23 well shit I think
02:53:25 I think people's
02:53:27 to be effective a protest needs to be disruptive
02:53:29 and yeah I think that even that
02:53:31 goes for things I don't like
02:53:33 like if fucking anti-vaxxers want to have a protest
02:53:35 and they want to block roads to make a statement
02:53:37 like
02:53:39 I mean I guess they should have the same
02:53:41 protection the same legal
02:53:43 protection to do that as anyone else
02:53:45 I mean you know
02:53:47 yeah I would
02:53:49 yeah they have the right to do it
02:53:51 because it's like it only
02:53:53 takes a change of government to make it
02:53:55 so that now you can't protest
02:53:57 you know if you couldn't protest one thing
02:53:59 before yeah then it'll be
02:54:01 it'll come back
02:54:03 and then I mean
02:54:05 I mean you might the reverse
02:54:07 you can't protest leftist things that would be bad
02:54:09 so like
02:54:11 just blanket allow
02:54:13 I think so you might get arrested
02:54:15 like sometimes in the
02:54:17 course of protest like if you block traffic on a road
02:54:19 like that's illegal you know you might get arrested
02:54:21 or something if you
02:54:23 you know
02:54:25 and that's okay
02:54:27 it's fine
02:54:29 people know that that's going to happen and they do it
02:54:31 they can cause a scene and they're taking
02:54:33 the being in prison
02:54:35 for a little bit it's part of
02:54:37 the jail if the argument is
02:54:39 should we allow protests then obviously
02:54:41 yeah we should
02:54:43 right
02:54:45 was there anything else to this question I feel like
02:54:47 well he was asking how should they be handled ideally
02:54:49 I don't really know
02:54:51 what else to say about it though
02:54:53 you know I remember years ago I got into
02:54:55 kind of a small argument
02:54:57 on AOL
02:54:59 instant messenger
02:55:01 with someone about protests
02:55:03 this was back in
02:55:05 2003 when Wind Waker
02:55:07 had come out
02:55:09 and I was arguing
02:55:11 with someone from the UK
02:55:13 and
02:55:15 I wasn't really arguing
02:55:17 he got real mad I wasn't
02:55:19 and I think I told him
02:55:21 he wanted to protest the wars
02:55:23 that were going on
02:55:25 so he was attending local protests
02:55:27 and
02:55:29 I said I agree with this position
02:55:31 I was also against these wars
02:55:33 but I kind of told him
02:55:35 I don't think the protest you're going to
02:55:37 is going to do much good because
02:55:39 in general when
02:55:41 governments invade countries they don't
02:55:43 really pay a whole lot of attention to protesting
02:55:45 and he got really
02:55:47 he got really offended by that
02:55:49 and I wasn't trying to
02:55:51 offend him or anything
02:55:53 but he got so offended by that
02:55:55 he basically blocked me for like
02:55:57 10 years after that
02:55:59 oh jeez
02:56:01 I mean
02:56:03 I guess you're right
02:56:05 individual actions are weak
02:56:07 and like a single protest
02:56:09 isn't going to stop the war
02:56:11 I mean
02:56:13 I don't know much about
02:56:15 the actual validity of those things
02:56:17 I know there was a lot of war protests
02:56:19 and
02:56:21 with every war
02:56:23 there's been a bunch of people saying
02:56:25 stop it
02:56:27 a bunch of damn beatnik hippies going
02:56:29 don't stop killing people
02:56:31 how dare they tell the United States
02:56:33 government to stop killing people
02:56:35 don't they know the United States government
02:56:37 is literally neurodivergent and a minor
02:56:39 yeah exactly
02:56:41 I mean it's
02:56:43 it's a new country
02:56:45 but I think there was a lot more
02:56:47 opposition to these wars than
02:56:49 maybe some wars in the past
02:56:51 they were not very popular
02:56:53 they were not very popular wars
02:56:55 that's
02:56:57 I don't okay
02:56:59 they were
02:57:01 they were kind of popular
02:57:03 people were
02:57:05 largely pretty okay
02:57:07 well I mean obviously not everybody
02:57:09 but there was a lot of
02:57:11 people who were like yeah
02:57:13 we're mad about 9-11
02:57:15 we gotta do some war
02:57:17 but there's always
02:57:19 people who are into it and not into it
02:57:21 but I think in general these wars
02:57:23 they kind of got compared to like
02:57:25 Vietnam
02:57:27 Vietnam was not a very popular war
02:57:29 a lot of people hated it
02:57:31 a lot of people were against it
02:57:33 so I kind of think this is
02:57:35 similar situation
02:57:37 but
02:57:39 I just thought that
02:57:41 in general protests don't
02:57:43 have much effect on
02:57:45 stuff like war
02:57:47 they tend to have bigger effects on
02:57:49 other smaller issues
02:57:51 but when it comes to like
02:57:53 big issues like war
02:57:55 they unfortunately don't seem to have
02:57:57 almost any effect
02:57:59 which sucks
02:58:01 I don't know I mean
02:58:03 I think you're kind of correct
02:58:05 but it's just sort of like
02:58:07 it doesn't really matter
02:58:09 that they're not effective
02:58:11 because in aggregate
02:58:13 like many people protesting about the war
02:58:15 will
02:58:17 at the very least
02:58:19 influence the politicians
02:58:21 in a way that they're like
02:58:23 oh if I want to get votes
02:58:25 I can't be pro-war
02:58:27 and then they'll try not to do
02:58:29 war stuff so much
02:58:31 Vietnam was not popular
02:58:33 everybody was like stop
02:58:35 Vietnam
02:58:37 and we eventually just kind of did
02:58:39 we just kind of gave up on Vietnam
02:58:41 because we weren't
02:58:43 and like
02:58:45 so many Americans
02:58:47 it was unpopular and people were
02:58:49 protesting it and everyone
02:58:51 popular opinion was just like this war is bad
02:58:53 and we shouldn't be doing it
02:58:55 and eventually we did stop
02:58:57 right?
02:58:59 the fact that it was publicly unpopular
02:59:01 I think might have been part of
02:59:03 why it stopped
02:59:05 it might have just kept going
02:59:07 that's basically what happened with Afghanistan
02:59:09 I guess
02:59:11 unfortunately with Afghanistan it took like 20 years
02:59:13 it took so fucking long
02:59:15 oh my god
02:59:17 it took so long because they had a lot
02:59:19 of money
02:59:21 from the oil they were getting
02:59:23 at some point
02:59:25 no no the US
02:59:27 and the UK
02:59:29 there was money in it to stay in it
02:59:31 but I think
02:59:33 protesting
02:59:35 and they seem to have convinced
02:59:37 people
02:59:39 in a large enough amount that it's
02:59:41 okay and good
02:59:43 that we're over there still
02:59:45 people grumbled about it but they didn't really change
02:59:47 their vote too much
02:59:49 yep
02:59:51 it was just
02:59:53 it was like
02:59:55 people didn't even really talk about it like it was
02:59:57 a war
02:59:59 it was just kind of like we're there
03:00:01 and that's just how it is
03:00:03 and like it was
03:00:05 it was called the war in Afghanistan
03:00:07 and people
03:00:09 but people didn't really talk about it like it was a war
03:00:11 it's just
03:00:13 kind of like a thing
03:00:15 they did call it the war on terror
03:00:17 for a while I guess
03:00:19 for a while
03:00:21 do you like terror
03:00:23 what are you pro terror
03:00:25 you crazy
03:00:27 that's a halloween
03:00:29 neurodivergent and a minor
03:00:31 protesting is cool
03:00:33 I used to support protesting
03:00:35 it doesn't change anything
03:00:37 but I guess I'm just really cynical
03:00:39 about it sometimes
03:00:41 people do those
03:00:43 petitions on change.org
03:00:45 whatever they collect signatures
03:00:47 and sometimes
03:00:49 it doesn't change anything
03:00:53 yeah I mean
03:00:55 true
03:00:57 I think that even though
03:00:59 it seems
03:01:01 fruitless
03:01:03 a good argument for not doing it
03:01:07 that's true
03:01:09 except for maybe a waste of time
03:01:11 it doesn't make
03:01:13 the war last longer to go protest about it
03:01:19 I don't know
03:01:21 I don't know if you want
03:01:23 I don't fucking know
03:01:25 whatever
03:01:27 good for him for wanting to
03:01:29 make a statement
03:01:31 like I said I supported
03:01:33 his stance on it
03:01:35 cause he was basically trying
03:01:37 to get me to go to
03:01:39 protests and stuff
03:01:41 you should look up local protests in your area
03:01:43 and I was like
03:01:45 I'm not gonna do that
03:01:47 I just said
03:01:49 I'm just gonna play wind waker
03:01:51 it just came out
03:01:53 bro wind waker just came out
03:01:55 I'm a wall
03:01:57 I'm not
03:01:59 emotionally available for that
03:02:01 exactly so
03:02:03 they didn't sit well with him
03:02:05 so he blocked me
03:02:09 he just didn't like wind waker
03:02:11 he was like fuck no
03:02:13 he looks so cartoony
03:02:15 they copied it from the little prince
03:02:17 in the seven headed dragon
03:02:19 the eight headed dragon
03:02:21 he looks like the same guy
03:02:23 but they made him
03:02:25 you can go out there
03:02:27 you can go out there and protest
03:02:29 and I'll provide you moral support
03:02:31 while I play wind waker
03:02:37 I'll send you my thoughts
03:02:39 and prayers
03:02:47 okay that was the last voicemail
03:02:49 I'm reloading to see
03:02:51 what
03:02:53 there's a new
03:02:55 nope we got one
03:02:57 we got a last minute voicemail
03:02:59 why would you reload
03:03:01 I don't know
03:03:03 but I did
03:03:05 it's called
03:03:07 the blue glow skull monkeys
03:03:09 one hour 17 minutes 23 seconds
03:03:11 okay
03:03:13 three two one go
03:03:15 I just realized
03:03:17 that there is a lecture I could give
03:03:19 and I would be able to go into a lot of detail
03:03:21 and present a lot of interesting information
03:03:23 but nobody would want it
03:03:25 at all
03:03:27 it would be the least wanted lecture
03:03:29 of all time
03:03:31 and it would be the brony community
03:03:33 well I'll tell you what
03:03:35 I wouldn't fucking watch that lecture
03:03:37 I know
03:03:39 why did I say that
03:03:41 why did I say I wouldn't watch it
03:03:43 I had to be joking
03:03:45 because I definitely would
03:03:47 I could not
03:03:49 what was I thinking
03:03:51 when the whole brony
03:03:53 lecture thing first happened
03:03:55 and Trixie decided not to release it
03:03:57 at first
03:03:59 on a personal level I didn't care that much
03:04:01 because I was never really into the brony
03:04:03 stuff
03:04:05 but then I saw you
03:04:07 talk to someone on twitter about it
03:04:09 and someone said
03:04:11 why don't you do a lecture on the pcp
03:04:13 history
03:04:15 and then you responded well that's basically what the brony
03:04:17 lecture was
03:04:19 a lot of it was
03:04:21 so when I saw that
03:04:23 then I thought well darn
03:04:25 now I actually want to watch
03:04:27 the brony lecture
03:04:29 it was like
03:04:31 a lecture about the brony culture
03:04:33 from the lens
03:04:35 of the horseshoe crew
03:04:37 and how we all met in all of our history together
03:04:39 a lot of it was focused on
03:04:41 on us
03:04:43 as a part of the
03:04:45 brony
03:04:47 I am actually pretty bummed out
03:04:49 that I can't watch that lecture
03:04:51 I know
03:04:53 man I know
03:04:55 for the record I'll say it again
03:04:57 I don't agree
03:04:59 with the decision not to release it
03:05:01 but that's not like
03:05:03 I think some people
03:05:05 think that's like the one thing
03:05:07 that's the straw that broke the camel's back
03:05:09 that made me like
03:05:11 I hate Trixie now
03:05:13 that was just one
03:05:15 little thing that was like bad
03:05:17 but it wasn't like
03:05:19 it's not the main thing
03:05:21 it's
03:05:23 the attitude
03:05:25 towards the people who
03:05:27 paid for
03:05:29 Radcom and other things
03:05:31 it's literally just because
03:05:33 she's trans
03:05:35 it's literally
03:05:37 the hot clipped
03:05:39 it's the thing
03:05:41 when I think about
03:05:43 what made me
03:05:45 not like Trixie anymore
03:05:47 it's things that she said to me
03:05:49 I can't believe you would treat me this way
03:05:51 I can't believe you would say that to me
03:05:53 and mean it
03:05:55 terrible
03:05:57 I remember those big money connections
03:05:59 the big money connections
03:06:01 and like oh Ben
03:06:03 you don't get to use my big money connections anymore
03:06:05 fuck you
03:06:07 and the time that I got mad at May
03:06:09 for being a Nazi
03:06:11 message me to be like you're just jealous that I get laid
03:06:13 Ben
03:06:15 you're just jealous that I get to have sex with my Nazi year old friend
03:06:17 and you don't
03:06:19 those are the two big ones
03:06:21 very funny
03:06:23 I don't
03:06:25 agree with a lot of
03:06:27 stuff that she's done
03:06:29 but
03:06:31 I kind of feel like a cyber shell
03:06:33 on this kind of thing where I personally
03:06:35 don't like hate her
03:06:37 or dislike her
03:06:39 well you know
03:06:41 my issues with her are completely personal
03:06:43 so it's not like I expect everybody else
03:06:45 yeah I think you're completely justified
03:06:47 in hating her
03:06:49 but
03:06:51 she's never done anything against me
03:06:53 so I don't have
03:06:55 any personal justification
03:06:57 first they came for the Ben Saints
03:06:59 yeah first they came for Ben St
03:07:01 and I said nothing because I was not
03:07:03 Ben St and then I looked
03:07:05 and Ben St was gone
03:07:07 no
03:07:09 I miss him I loved him so much
03:07:11 why didn't I save him
03:07:13 the only slight thing
03:07:15 she kind of did is that
03:07:17 for me anyways
03:07:19 she didn't give me the ransom I paid for
03:07:21 but I don't really care about that
03:07:23 that's pretty irritating
03:07:25 that's pretty annoying
03:07:27 that would be enough for me
03:07:29 I don't think that was like
03:07:31 her intention I don't think she maliciously
03:07:33 did that I think she just forgot
03:07:35 that's
03:07:37 I mean
03:07:39 forgetting is still bad
03:07:41 that's just
03:07:43 people pay you
03:07:45 to do some things
03:07:47 I didn't mean to rip people off
03:07:49 I just didn't mean to take the money and run
03:07:51 I just did it though
03:07:53 I do think it's irresponsible
03:07:55 but I just don't care enough
03:07:57 to make a big deal about it
03:07:59 I understand not caring to follow her up
03:08:01 but it's not okay
03:08:03 that she was irresponsible
03:08:05 yeah I'm not saying it's okay
03:08:07 I'm just saying that I'm not upset about it
03:08:09 even though I could be
03:08:11 maybe I should be but
03:08:13 yeah
03:08:15 that's fine I get it
03:08:17 I mean what is it like 15 bucks or something
03:08:19 it's not much
03:08:21 in question here
03:08:23 so fucking much
03:08:25 I could do anything for $15
03:08:27 I imagine
03:08:29 I mean for the
03:08:31 for the product
03:08:33 of a short little rant about whatever
03:08:35 even if you don't know what it is
03:08:37 yeah this thing
03:08:39 whatever it sucks and it's like 15 bucks
03:08:41 for that
03:08:43 I didn't actually watch it lol
03:08:45 she was making quite a lot of money
03:08:47 from those rants
03:08:49 honestly she shouldn't have stopped doing that
03:08:51 she should have continued
03:08:53 because
03:08:55 it seemed like it was working
03:08:57 it seemed like it was working pretty well
03:08:59 for a while there
03:09:01 I think she stopped because she was getting too many of them
03:09:03 and she couldn't like do all of them
03:09:05 or was taking too much of her
03:09:07 time from other stuff
03:09:09 but I feel like there would have been
03:09:11 a fairly simple way to solve that
03:09:13 problem which is
03:09:15 you just limit the amount of people
03:09:17 who can be at that tier
03:09:19 well you could do that or you could increase the amount
03:09:21 of money that it costs
03:09:23 and that way less people would
03:09:25 buy rants
03:09:27 and that would make more money per rant
03:09:29 yeah
03:09:31 if the demand
03:09:33 is exceeding the supply
03:09:35 you raise the price
03:09:37 and then you're going to lower the demand automatically
03:09:39 you would still make money
03:09:41 but you wouldn't have to do as many rants
03:09:43 so I don't know why she just stopped entirely
03:09:45 that seems like a really stupid business decision
03:09:47 but
03:09:49 yeah
03:09:51 I mean
03:09:53 it only takes a few minutes
03:09:55 and she's making you know
03:09:57 yeah you just got to price it so that like
03:09:59 if the amount you're charging
03:10:01 is like a worthwhile amount
03:10:03 for the time that it takes you to do it
03:10:05 and I don't see why
03:10:07 yeah like then more is just good
03:10:09 like more is just good as long as it's worth
03:10:11 as long as the return on what you're doing
03:10:13 is positive
03:10:15 I mean if I could
03:10:17 make money that way
03:10:19 I would never stop
03:10:21 that's for sure
03:10:23 just so
03:10:25 I guess bizarre to think
03:10:27 the people in large enough quantities
03:10:29 that she couldn't keep up
03:10:31 would be willing to pay
03:10:33 $15
03:10:35 every month
03:10:37 to support her but also for rants
03:10:39 that was so
03:10:41 like the amount of like
03:10:43 goodwill and like
03:10:45 fandom that she had at her disposal
03:10:47 is unfathomable
03:10:49 compared to where we are right now
03:10:51 it's pretty
03:10:53 it's pretty starting
03:10:55 it sucks that she was so like
03:10:57 disrespectful towards her fans
03:10:59 and kind of like
03:11:01 didn't treat them very well because they were
03:11:03 real nice to her and they supported her a lot
03:11:05 you know
03:11:07 much too nice
03:11:09 I don't respect it
03:11:11 I don't respect Trixie fandom
03:11:13 or Digi Bro fandom in 2021
03:11:15 I don't respect it anymore
03:11:17 I don't know if there's much left
03:11:19 of it has vanished
03:11:21 yeah
03:11:23 what are we talking about
03:11:25 why are we talking about this
03:11:27 we've been over this
03:11:29 we've
03:11:31 this is all well trodden
03:11:33 this is what the people want
03:11:35 this is what the people want
03:11:37 you know most people
03:11:39 there were a few people that
03:11:41 pledged for the one month
03:11:43 and then unpledged
03:11:45 from the bonus episodes
03:11:47 pledged stuck around
03:11:49 are still patrons
03:11:51 as of this month
03:11:53 so I mean I'm very happy
03:11:55 about that
03:11:57 mean the pcp patreon
03:11:59 yes that's what I'm talking about
03:12:01 because we got the big bump
03:12:03 when I released those last three episodes
03:12:05 including the cyber shell
03:12:07 goss one
03:12:09 yes thank you
03:12:11 I hope you enjoyed the fun
03:12:13 patrons I hope you
03:12:15 enjoyed the fun fact challenge
03:12:17 post your fun facts down below
03:12:19 if you got them
03:12:21 next time you should do
03:12:23 unfun facts
03:12:25 unfun facts
03:12:27 depressing facts
03:12:29 no I don't know
03:12:31 did you know the ear
03:12:33 you put oil in it
03:12:35 this is what happens with the ear
03:12:37 some day you're going to get
03:12:39 crippling arthritis and all your bones were hurt
03:12:41 yeah
03:12:43 I drink my milk
03:12:45 I'm there man I'm there
03:12:47 I'm in
03:12:49 sign me up
03:12:51 a couple weeks ago I had the episode about
03:12:53 broken back so my back was bothering me
03:12:55 pleased to report that my back is pretty much
03:12:57 fine it doesn't really bother me
03:12:59 anymore hardly at all so I think
03:13:01 I think I just had to
03:13:03 I think I was aggravating it by like
03:13:05 twisting my back I was trying to crack
03:13:07 my back because it gave me like a
03:13:09 temporary feeling of relief
03:13:11 I was like twisting myself so far
03:13:13 that I was like pulling the muscle and like
03:13:15 causing it
03:13:17 injury so we just like stopped doing
03:13:19 that even though I wanted to
03:13:21 and it kind of just
03:13:23 it kind of went away so I think that was
03:13:25 the problem I was
03:13:27 I think if you
03:13:29 you work out and strengthen your muscles
03:13:31 properly you can kind of reduce the likelihood
03:13:33 of back pain and stuff
03:13:35 but if you work out
03:13:37 you can cause back pain so you gotta
03:13:39 be careful
03:13:41 people say oh
03:13:43 deadlifts are dangerous you'll hurt your back
03:13:45 and like well it's possible
03:13:47 but also if you don't
03:13:49 lift and you don't exercise
03:13:51 and you don't keep your back muscles
03:13:53 strong then you
03:13:55 that is
03:13:57 then you are much more likely to have back
03:13:59 problems because you are weak
03:14:01 and your body is
03:14:03 decrepit
03:14:05 so it's really damned if you do damned
03:14:07 if you don't
03:14:13 anything else on the docket
03:14:15 for today before we close
03:14:17 just a reminder

03:14:57 I said I wasn't gonna crack my back anymore
03:14:59 but I just did it
03:15:01 go to gamerstavern.com
03:15:03 if you wanna read a review
03:15:05 on front mission gun hazard
03:15:07 for some reason
03:15:09 yeah I kinda do actually
03:15:11 I might actually read that one
03:15:13 just because I'm
03:15:15 I think it's weird
03:15:17 I think it's really weird that they made that game
03:15:19 go to youtube.com
03:15:21 gamers tavern show to watch
03:15:23 videos with puns in them
03:15:25 all the videos contain puns usually
03:15:27 true
03:15:31 you can follow me on twitter
03:15:33 at gamer tavern
03:15:35 without the s in the middle
03:15:37 mmm
03:15:39 speakpipe.com
03:15:41 if you want to leave
03:15:43 a voicemail
03:15:45 you know who else takes voicemails now
03:15:47 anamorphentime
03:15:49 the anamorphentime podcast
03:15:51 I believe they also have a speakpipe
03:15:53 where you can send them voicemails
03:15:55 speakpipe will like fill up
03:15:57 I told Tyler
03:15:59 he asked me how to set up a speakpipe
03:16:01 or he asked me how we did voicemails
03:16:03 and I told him about speakpipe and I said
03:16:07 it says there's a 100 megabyte limit
03:16:09 but there's not
03:16:11 you can just go over it and
03:16:13 they won't stop you
03:16:15 and he was like cool
03:16:17 how they're gonna stop you
03:16:19 they're gonna send cops to bust down your door
03:16:21 you need to get a warrant first
03:16:23 I think they would
03:16:25 you would
03:16:27 all that happens when you exceed it
03:16:29 is they add a button that says
03:16:31 action required add more storage
03:16:33 and it's like you're gonna need to add more storage
03:16:35 if you're gonna want to keep getting voicemails
03:16:37 do you want to pay us money
03:16:39 to upgrade your account
03:16:41 but if you don't press the button
03:16:43 they don't actually stop you
03:16:45 they don't actually stop you
03:16:47 they're gonna figure that out
03:16:49 you would think they would have figured it out
03:16:51 I think they must know
03:16:53 this is a very obvious loophole
03:16:55 in their system
03:16:57 this can't be an accident
03:16:59 is this like the windrower thing
