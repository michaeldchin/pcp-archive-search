00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:08 the best guy ever and I don't know what channel this video is going up on. We've got Ben
00:00:14 Saint over there. Yeah, we're still in this pickle here and this hacker pickle if you
00:00:21 know what I'm saying. And this ripple pickle. This ripple pickle. Gibbontake, Tom Oliver,
00:00:29 Yeah, I'm here and I'm sad. The usual reasons or anything? I'm sad about the hack. I'm talking
00:00:37 about the hack. I mean, I'm sad about everything. There's a coronavirus in Massachusetts. We're
00:00:41 all going to die, doom and gloom, blah, blah, blah, whatever. It's going to happen eventually.
00:00:46 There's Munchy. I don't know if I have all the paperwork to be on this show. I mean,
00:00:50 I went to the DMV and I got a stamp. I don't know if it's the right stamp. I tried to talk
00:00:53 to the committee, but they wouldn't talk to me this ago. We wouldn't talk to mudbloods
00:00:55 like yourself. And I went down to the other DMV that one that doesn't have a hearsay officer
00:00:59 and they don't have the hearing officer. And I went over there and I said, Hey, can I have
00:01:02 the paperwork to be on the podcast? And they said, you're already recording the podcast
00:01:05 right now. And then they put me in handcuffs. And here I am. What do they have you guys
00:01:09 for? Like, how'd you get in here? Like, what's the problem with you?
00:01:14 They said, you're a part of the PCP die. And there I was. Hey, you're part of that cryptocurrency
00:01:19 like scam, like a live stream, right? Yeah, that's me. We have lost 1000 subscribers
00:01:25 from the PCP channel. Thanks. How many subscribers are you down? I dare. I dare not ask, but
00:01:32 I ask anyway. Great question, Tom. But on the best gaver channel now rebranding permanently
00:01:38 as Brad Garlinghouse, they have hidden the subscriber count. So I have no, I can guarantee
00:01:44 you. Well, I mean, yeah, I haven't actually checked social blade, but I know social blade.
00:01:49 I mean, don't they not have access to like, you know, I don't know who knows. It's a mystery
00:01:54 to us all. Yeah, I don't know. I could check still going on. It's still like currently
00:01:59 happening. Yeah, obviously, he's still streaming every day. Are you not aware of this?
00:02:04 I haven't checked anything. Why don't we just all just spam YouTube like over and over and
00:02:08 over again? That I mean, well, at this point, I think, you know, it's been long enough that
00:02:14 I feel like they're not doing anything. It's been since about the 22nd or the 23rd is when
00:02:20 I noticed it. And I might have contact them as late as like the 24th or 25th overall. But
00:02:24 it's been, you know, about a solid week over a week. I think it's time to enforce mob rule.
00:02:33 We need to just hashtag Twitter, destroy YouTube. You know, I'll tell you, everyone's
00:02:40 everyone says that YouTube only really responds to people like humiliating them on social
00:02:45 media. That's the only way I sexually respond to anyone. Someone humiliates me in public.
00:02:49 Yeah, humiliation. I've been talking to a couple people who have had these issues or
00:02:54 people who follow them. And I have been informed that like just for example, I was telling you
00:02:57 guys before, but I'll tell the audience here that like, for your interest, there was a
00:03:01 guy with like a small following, maybe like a couple thousand or something who took eight
00:03:06 weeks to get restored, clearly because he's just, you know, not high on their priority
00:03:11 list. And then someone like Pogo with like many hundreds of thousands of subs apparently
00:03:16 took like a few days to like a week or something along these lines. And like, I don't even
00:03:20 know if they specifically, there was like a campaign with Pogo, but I think they just
00:03:24 were like, okay, this guy we should do something with because he matters. So like, I go, what
00:03:29 do you do? Music man, it doesn't matter. Are you high? I wish I was. I wish I was real. I
00:03:35 don't believe that. So I at this point, I'm, I don't like to do these things, but I'm left
00:03:39 with no alternative, but to think that like it's just about the pressure that's being
00:03:43 put on these people. And like the tickets exist. Like Google is apparently doing the things
00:03:48 they're passing them on to the internal team, whatever that means, but apparently the internal
00:03:52 team is not like actively fixing the problem yet. They're like in queue probably.
00:03:57 I really feel like it would only be a matter of a few button presses for them.
00:04:01 I feel strongly that that is the case as well. But like, so I have no alternative, but to
00:04:07 think that like, yeah, I mean, what exactly is the harm of getting everybody who listens
00:04:10 to this to spam at team YouTube with full authority, be polite, be respectful, but let
00:04:16 them know what the issue is. Cause this is what they're for, right? What's the harm in
00:04:20 doing so I, you know, go for it. I say, in fact, I call upon you that like at them on
00:04:26 Twitter, team YouTube. Okay. So our current society is, is thus the following. Um, like
00:04:33 basically just like huge like tech bros from San Francisco and like San Jose can basically
00:04:37 just like, you know, completely ruin society with a click of a button with, with half an
00:04:42 a press they're released as a society. They create robots and algorithms to run their sites
00:04:46 for them so they can maximize suffering and minimize the amount of money they have to
00:04:49 pay people to oversee things. And then when it doesn't work, the only way to get it to
00:04:53 like, you know, the site to actually, you know, function in any way is to constantly
00:04:56 bombard them with bad PR. And that's the only way to do it. And they have just created
00:05:01 robots and do nothing for us. That really does seem to relatively accurately reflect
00:05:06 the current situation. I just think it's ridiculous that like YouTube has all these people on
00:05:10 their site, like making a living through their platform, but their pay is so bad that people
00:05:16 have to go to outside sources in order to make any money. And it is that part of the
00:05:20 equation that is actually lucrative for hackers to try and steal your shit, not through YouTube
00:05:23 itself, but through sponsorships, because that's the only way you can make money effectively
00:05:28 on YouTube now because of their draconian policies. It's just like multiple levels of
00:05:32 failure, which I find hilarious.
00:05:34 Bro, bro, why, why, why are you leaving? Do you didn't even smash your Acai bowl? I say
00:05:38 twirling in my mustache with my thick rimmed glasses to my tech, bro. He says, bro, I found
00:05:43 the best way to destroy society, dude. I just found a way to completely obliterate culture
00:05:47 forever. We can make this brand new hashtag, which minimizes the amount of people that
00:05:52 are able to hear about third world issues. And I can also brainwash people and make them
00:05:56 spend all their time addicted to social media. I found this brand new way to hack into a human's
00:06:00 physiology and make them completely addicted to retweeting things. Dude, that's so epic.
00:06:05 Dude, I'm dropping my Acai bowl too. Can we stop and get some more flannel shirts on the
00:06:09 way over there? Hell yeah, dude. Also, I sleep in my car on the Facebook campus. I don't have
00:06:13 a house.
00:06:14 That does sound great. Should we, should we unify this around a hashtag of some kind? What
00:06:19 about hashtag save the PCP? What do you think? Is that, is that good? Is that too dramatic?
00:06:24 How about hashtag do the PCP and then it's drug marketed? How about hashtag do your fucking
00:06:29 job? I'm concerned that they will restore best guy ever and maybe the PCP and like everything
00:06:40 else like Canton and T-Bap and stuff will just get ignored. I mean, certainly a possibility
00:06:45 or at least like take way longer. If they do worse, then why wouldn't they do all of them?
00:06:51 I don't know the answer to that. YouTube is high school. It's just a popularity contest. If
00:06:55 you're not big enough, they don't give a fuck. Yeah, I just feel like they will do one, they
00:06:59 will maybe restore like the biggest channel and then be like, Hey, we did it. And like you
00:07:03 should be great. You should be grateful that we did literally any part of our job. Thanks very
00:07:07 much. The way that I had to submit the tickets, it's like basically it seems by Google account.
00:07:12 So like for example, on the PCP, I think the two channels that disappeared are the PCP and
00:07:16 the podcast, which was on like the PCP Google account as well. So like, I feel like if we get
00:07:22 the PCP back, probably as part of that conversation, we can we can fix the podcast as well. And the
00:07:27 same way, like my beachy channels, like a bunch of them got taken bestie boy and the live streams
00:07:31 one, like I can probably get them all back as a package deal. But T-Bap and content are on their
00:07:36 own. Those are on separate little Google accounts. I mean, maybe the fact that Digi's involved with,
00:07:41 you know, fucking T-Bap can help. Maybe once I actually get contact with like an internal person,
00:07:47 I can kind of be like, Hey, bro, kind of got a larger issue here. I would love to solve all these
00:07:51 at once. Maybe that'll happen. I don't know. I don't know. Literally, it would take someone at
00:07:56 like Google headquarters, like half an hour to just fix everything. I definitely think that's
00:08:02 correct. And that's being generous. Speaking of algorithms, completely. What's what's even the
00:08:08 word? Like putting like a boot on the throat of human endeavor. I was informed by close friend and
00:08:14 confidant and fellow occupier of space in the physical world, Kazi Snepp earlier today, of a
00:08:21 delicious, delicious, I've not like, so this person got a background check for their job. And the
00:08:29 company that he applied to ran a background check on him. They went through his entire Twitter and
00:08:33 made a report of every single tweet that he had liked with the word fucking it.
00:08:38 Liked? Yeah, I saw this. This was on r slash boring dystopia, which is an amazing sub-branded.
00:08:46 Did he get the job or something? I mean, what's the... I highly doubt it.
00:08:49 They counted it up. And the more fucks there were, the more likely he was to be high. Well,
00:08:53 they just, they had like different things like trig, like it was like, it's like, this is bad
00:08:58 because language is bad because alcohol is bad because all those things. This is exactly what
00:09:03 my mom warned me about when I was making Facebook posts like a decade ago about me at a party in
00:09:09 college holding a solo cup and being a silly boy. I'm assuming these are boomers who are
00:09:16 enacting these policies. So it makes me not surprised at all that the things our parents
00:09:20 that are now coming to pass as they are in charge of all the companies now. Okay, but, but I have
00:09:25 to pour cold water on everyone who's getting all hot and bothered about this. Sure. A report was
00:09:30 done on his Twitter, finding all the words with fuck. I need to know before I know how mad to get
00:09:36 exactly how that impacted his chances of getting, or was it simply a report about that? That is
00:09:41 irrelevant. That's fucked up. That has no relevance to the situation whatsoever. Of course it's
00:09:45 irrelevant. It doesn't matter. The fact that they're doing it at all is ridiculous.
00:09:51 To go through Facebook monitoring to make sure they don't say fuck.
00:09:56 This guy applied to a job and the company he was applying to did a background check on him,
00:10:01 went through his entire Twitter account and found all the questionable tweets that just had like
00:10:07 a swear in it or referenced alcohol in any form. That he had just liked. And just made a whole
00:10:11 print out and like said, these are all like flags. All right. Yes, that's very dystopian that they
00:10:16 looked that up. Okay, I totally agree. I totally agree. That's fair. But I'm also curious what the
00:10:21 next step was. Yeah, I am wondering like, did they get this report and look at it and be like,
00:10:25 oh, the computer's done something stupid. Maybe the boomers also said, well, obviously we don't
00:10:29 care about this. Why are you talking about getting a job at Facebook? It's not Facebook.
00:10:36 It's not Facebook. It's just some random company. In a hypothetical situation where there are two
00:10:40 candidates and they have the exact same credentials. It's like, hmm, which one do we pick?
00:10:47 Then tweets that they've liked with the word fucking, it might be the thing that people use
00:10:52 eventually to tip the balance. So I guess delete all your accounts.
00:10:59 Yeah, I mean, if you have two exactly equal applicants and one just says fuck more, you're
00:11:03 going to be like, well, that's not as good for my business as someone not saying fuck potentially.
00:11:08 So I'll just, you know, take the safer option. Who are these fucking alien like bug creatures?
00:11:14 They're like, oh, the people, if they know an employee of mine, you know, some like
00:11:18 janitor in one of my franchisees stores, if they said fuck one time on Twitter, that's going to
00:11:24 really hurt my brand. That's a bad representative of the company, dude. Bad representative of the
00:11:28 company. Get them out of here. The micromanaging is just sad. I can't imagine that this would
00:11:35 be in any way sustainable because of the amount of people that are on social media right now
00:11:40 that will need jobs in the near future. If like 700,000 people can't get a job because
00:11:48 they've said fuck on Twitter before, then what are the offices going to be filled with?
00:11:57 In 15 years or so, the millennials will be in that position, the boomers will be dead,
00:12:03 and this policy will go away because no one from our age demographic is going to think that's in
00:12:08 any way logical. And it'll just now that you can only get a job if you've said fuck on Twitter
00:12:13 before. Yeah, yeah, exactly. If you don't have pronouns in your bio, that's how you that's the
00:12:18 only way you can get a job. You know, perhaps social media is such an omnipresent force in
00:12:23 people's lives. And because you basically need like a Twitter account or at least a flirt with
00:12:26 Twitter for a while to have a a social standing in the current modern world. This means that if
00:12:32 you at all act, I'm going to say genuinely on social media whatsoever, and you anyway have your
00:12:37 real life persona tied to your internet persona, then this means that basically you have to perform
00:12:43 what 100% of the time, you know, existing as a human being online or off, you have to because
00:12:48 they have these such large degrees of like, you know, everything you do on the internet is completely,
00:12:52 you know, archive lockdown forever. You basically have to be performing from the day you fucking
00:12:57 start, you have to be like your parents just sit down with you and say like, Hey, Jimmy, look,
00:13:01 when you post on Twitter, make sure that this will be remembered forever, like every tweet you
00:13:05 ever like can be found and archives and your boss, big daddy, boss, monopoly bags will look that up
00:13:11 and use against you in a job application. So you've been well, hang on, that's the question.
00:13:16 Maybe there's a silver lining, not really silver lining, but maybe okay, because right now hiring
00:13:21 decisions right now still probably come down to a human being at the end of the day. So maybe we
00:13:27 can rely on our boomer heroes to get these reports and be like, Oh, you know, when I was young, I
00:13:33 was posting all my white nationalist propaganda too. So you know what, if the fact that you post a
00:13:37 couple of those, we'll let them off the hook this time. Maybe maybe there's no, again, it's not about
00:13:44 the job process part. It doesn't matter if like getting the job is not the bad thing here. The
00:13:49 fact that they even have access to this, the fact that keep in mind, this person gave them their
00:13:54 Twitter handle, they had to find it out, the company seek out the information, they seek out
00:13:59 this person's online account. The fact that these companies are so willing and able to look up
00:14:06 personal statements from years ago of people just because they want to be a fucking McDonald's cashier.
00:14:13 Ridiculous. I'm curious what this job was, what field it was in, you know, that would be perhaps
00:14:17 relevant, but I guess we don't know, whatever, doesn't matter, doesn't matter. Yeah, it's concerning.
00:14:22 It's not great, but like if you're an employer and you just like there's two buttons in front of
00:14:27 you, one is be willingly ignorant as to the private life of your of your potential employees,
00:14:34 when the other button is note a dystopian too much about them, be a morally upstanding character
00:14:41 in any way. You have a fiduciary responsibility as a business to try to pick the safest choice you
00:14:47 can. So like that is definitely not good for society, but business wise. There was a great
00:14:56 video by Philosophy Tube quite recently about data and data collection and stuff and he basically
00:15:06 argues with himself different characters playing about all of the different aspects of data collection
00:15:11 and how it's ruining society and how... Oh, are you talking about the Philosophy Tube video?
00:15:16 Yeah. Dammit, he just said that, Ben, listen. I'm sorry, this is really boring to me.
00:15:22 Well, it was a good video and you should all watch it if you like that conversation.
00:15:28 It's just called data and it ends with like a... Well, let's talk about it, but if you thought it
00:15:32 was interesting, don't just say go watch someone else's video. What was interesting about it?
00:15:35 Because it's so many fucking... All right, the cool part is... It's a conversation and it basically
00:15:42 shows every way that the conversation could possibly branch as they talk.
00:15:48 I don't care about the video, the way it's formatted. I care about what was said in that.
00:15:51 I mean, he's talking about like fucking problematic things that private corporations can
00:15:57 do with all this data that they're constantly collecting from you. The thing that I really
00:15:59 liked about the video was that from the perspective of the bouncer, he's just trying to do his job
00:16:05 and he constantly goes to that like, sorry, I just have to scan your ID and it boils down to
00:16:13 the ultimate point of, I know that all this data is ruining the world. I know it's destroying society.
00:16:20 I just don't want to think about it. I don't want to think. I just want to do my job and go home.
00:16:26 And that's where the video ends because ultimately that is the problem. People don't want to think
00:16:31 and the computers will do the thinking for them because life sucks and they don't want to have
00:16:35 to deal with all of that shit all the time. All right. I mean, there's only so much you
00:16:39 can put on any individual. Like if you're just in a system that just has these things in place,
00:16:45 like you kind of can't avoid using them. There needs to be, I don't know, some like higher level
00:16:50 thing, like a movement that's like, this is bad. We're going to stop using this through some mechanism.
00:16:54 I don't know. This guy needs a job. His job involves scanning people's IDs.
00:17:00 Yeah. Yeah. How can you blame him? Yeah. He could be, what's the word? He could rise above and be
00:17:06 like, no, I'm going to go and be gay instead for pay. I'll be gay for pay instead. That's the moral
00:17:13 choice. That's how we beat big data. Everybody's gonna go gay for pay. The new sleep type album,
00:17:19 gay for a pay day. But all that's going to change when they release the new gay bots
00:17:28 that will, you know, all gay men will lose their jobs. You're right. They're going to place this
00:17:32 out of the market. Dammit. I've been Boston of the fuck out, guys. I've really been so fucking
00:17:38 Massachusetts pill. It's really retarded. And I know everyone's like, oh my god, wow, the fucking
00:17:44 seven letter word or six letter word or how many letter words it is. Oh my god. He said it again,
00:17:48 wouldn't only shut the fuck up. And listen, I'm sorry, but fuck you. I'll never ship about it
00:17:53 because I've had strange and bizarre experiences and a like exponential Boston intake lately
00:18:01 for you see at my school. I have two courses basically dedicated to Boston in the terms of a
00:18:08 architecture class of the city of Boston, and then a like local activism class for the city of
00:18:14 Boston. I've been reading a Boston history book, which by the way, Ben, I gave you the pass for
00:18:17 the audible. You can log back. I have signed in and I opened that up this morning. I haven't
00:18:23 started listening. Yeah, I haven't started listening. And and I've been I've been just, I mean,
00:18:29 living here, obviously, I'm literally so fucking Massachusetts pill it hurts and I can't go back.
00:18:35 Our culture is not your fucking costume. It literally is. I literally want to paint my face.
00:18:40 I want a white face now.
00:18:42 Munchie is pulling a jauntron right now walking around dressed up like a pilgrim.
00:18:47 I wish I fucking was honestly. Dude, that book is so fucking crazy, Ben. The city
00:18:51 state of Boston. I recommend everyone Google search, Mark Peterson, city state of Boston,
00:18:56 because it has like a like a weird like, okay, so it has the history of New England from the
00:19:05 perspective, not of like Boston, the cradle of liberty, you know, oh, the famous American
00:19:11 Revolutionary site. Oh, you know, remember America? That happens later. This is just the
00:19:15 prelude to America. This is just like the first chapter of American history. It goes about it
00:19:19 from the perspective of the people actually at the time. And, you know, the decision they made
00:19:23 as a almost like a quasi independent colony, and the trials and tribulations, not of people
00:19:31 gunning to create the United States. That was not on anyone's mind. Yeah, no shit. Yeah. It was
00:19:35 for them to, you know, prosper as an independent city state, as the person says. And I love shit
00:19:42 like that. I love the best history is not the sort of, you know, popcorn, extra credits, like,
00:19:47 this happened, then this happened, then this happened, then this happened, then this has
00:19:49 happened. And it's not even the like, oh, you get really into like the heroes and the villains.
00:19:54 No, it's a great narrative story. No, no, no. The best history is the kind of history that makes you
00:19:59 remember, oh, wait, nothing was like planned. Nothing was ever like, oh, I'm like, nothing ever
00:20:06 had to be the way it is. So much of history is just like, coincidentally, oh, you stumble into
00:20:11 something. Oh, just coincidentally, oh, because of these various, you know, very specific, hyper
00:20:15 specific circumstances. Oh, now Boston has just, you know, randomly happenstance happened to appeal
00:20:22 to other like, English colonies at that specific point in world history. And oh, blue America
00:20:28 happened, wasn't even planned, wasn't intentional, wasn't destined or anything. And that stuff is
00:20:34 just like on a moment to moment, human level, it's always something that sticks with me. And
00:20:41 there's like, dude, at any moment, like, like the things that are happening right now, at any moment
00:20:47 could blossom and change into something that I would have never imagined happening before and
00:20:51 could potentially have ramifications for a long time afterward, like think back to my own experiences,
00:20:58 like stuff that like changed my life forever, like let's say going to Bronicon and meeting
00:21:03 Digi Bro. At the time, I just like saw Digi Bro. And like, I talked to him for like five minutes,
00:21:09 but that like changed my, I'm recording this podcast because of that small change.
00:21:13 And it's cool. Hey, speaking of destiny,
00:21:17 this slide aside, I do have an aside here, which I think will entertain the peanut gallery,
00:21:23 which is that my my down so I live in a house in Cincinnati, obviously, and your downstairs
00:21:29 name more like your down soy neighbors fucking accurate. Yeah. So so I had a downstairs neighbor
00:21:35 directly below me. It was a single guy, he moved out recently, I think it was like the army or
00:21:39 something. And like new neighbors moved in. So I have not actually met the man possibly I've seen
00:21:46 a man and a woman moving around inside. So I don't know who lives there. That's the
00:21:49 generosity. I hope you're married. I got I hope so. Jesus, but cohabitation,
00:21:55 big problem in today's society. They're not going to have right now. Watch the YouTube video about
00:22:01 that. Last week, I mentioned a political juice. I watched a six hour video about the importance
00:22:06 of civil society. And he spends a lot of it being like, I don't know about all this premarital
00:22:11 cohabitation. I mean, one could potentially make a case that it might be like better or worse for
00:22:17 society to do. Okay, but either way, either way, my Okay, so so like when it was a single guy
00:22:22 living down there, at least because I knew that guy a little bit, like he had like the back door,
00:22:27 there's like a back door in the house, which I that's how I get in my house. And like his window
00:22:31 did not have a shade over it. So like, and I would see him like playing League of Legends or
00:22:36 something through that window, as I'm like out walking the dog or coming home from something
00:22:40 or whatever. And like he has a he has a there's a porch that goes up on the right, it branches
00:22:43 upstairs to my thing. And on the left, it branches sort of into that door into his apartment or
00:22:48 whatever. And so once in a while, I would just be a little curious, there's no shade, I would just
00:22:54 I take a step up or two right on his step, I would peer in and be like, Oh, he's playing League
00:22:57 of Legends. And then I dip out and then I would go up my stairs, being a little nosy, it's true.
00:23:01 But I just want to know what he's playing. It's these windows wide open. If he doesn't want me
00:23:05 looking in, get a shade. This isn't my problem. This is your problem. I see my neighbors TV
00:23:10 constantly playing Smash. There you go. Exactly the same shit kind of shit. Okay,
00:23:15 but that man has moved out and there are now new people person living there. So the other day,
00:23:22 and I looked at him and I was like, Oh, boy, can't wait to look in the window and see some more
00:23:25 League of Legends and you're looking and oh, my God, they're playing smite. What the fuck?
00:23:30 Well, so the other day, I'm just I'm walking session or something and I like I just I walk
00:23:36 up to him and I happen to notice just kind of through the window that where they used to be
00:23:39 like a desk with the old neighbor. Now there's like a couch and I'm like, Oh, that's that's
00:23:43 an interesting change. But okay, still no shades guys, you're going to make this like your living
00:23:46 room and no shades. Okay, that's fine. And I go upstairs. And then the other day, the other day,
00:23:52 I'm thinking to myself, you know what, I don't know who the neighbors are, I should go introduce
00:23:55 myself sometime. I'll do that one of these days. But I'm coming home from something. I think I
00:24:00 just like dropped off Michelle at work or something. And I'm just walking in and I do my little, Oh,
00:24:03 you know, I'm just going to take a peek, see what's going on in there. And I step up on like
00:24:07 their side of the rail. For a good like three, four seconds, I'm standing there gazing directly
00:24:12 into this window, like getting the scene what's going it's like it's the middle of the night.
00:24:17 I know it's probably like 10pm or something. And I'm just standing there looking in at their
00:24:22 like couch and stuff. And then all of a sudden, like the focus of my eyes changes. And I realize
00:24:27 like one foot to the right of what I'm currently looking at, there is a woman sitting there looking
00:24:32 directly at me into her home. And I don't know if you guys have seen that vine where the girl
00:24:40 gets spooked by the possum, but I go like that. And I kind of dodge back and dodge downward.
00:24:45 And I run upstairs and hide and just hole up there. And now you can never introduce yourself.
00:24:52 I can never introduce myself. I mean, that's that's the full story. But like, I just knew,
00:24:59 man, that was not good. And I need to now, I need to definitely go give them like a pie or a bottle
00:25:05 of wine and be like, Hey, sorry about that. Just want to say hello. So your problem was
00:25:12 you panicked. You could have played it off as like you weren't actually paying attention.
00:25:15 I should have. I really should have. I okay, to be fair, I'm exaggerating a little bit exactly
00:25:20 how dramatic I kind of just step back quickly and then moved upstairs. But you know, it was it was
00:25:25 not ideal and I was even those subtle things. You've got to just like, just it's very, very
00:25:31 important split decisions happen in those situations. You failed the test, Nate.
00:25:35 That's when I learned what kind of a man I am. And it's a foolish, cowardly, panicky kind of man.
00:25:41 But I'll endeavor to rise above it. If only you were wearing your vampire Hunter D hat,
00:25:45 you could have just tipped it downward, blocked your eyes from view. You would have been safe.
00:25:50 What'd you say, Munchie? I think about the hours you could have spent playing League of Legends
00:25:54 with people and how well those hours would have been spent. And you know what, that's like my
00:25:58 old neighbor who lived down there, we would see he had like a little glass kind of porch that stuck
00:26:02 out like kind of in the middle of the driveway in the backyard. It doesn't matter. But like it's
00:26:06 another kind of like, like unshaded glass thing. There's a table there. I would see him with like
00:26:11 a bunch of, I guess his friends or contemporaries or whatever, gather around, I don't know, maybe once
00:26:16 a month or something and like play some tabletop game. And I don't really like tabletop games that
00:26:21 much. But I was like, I should have said hello to this man and like become, like me and Michelle
00:26:27 could have just gone and been paled around and been friends and stuff. But we never did. And then
00:26:31 he moved away. And I blew it. Don't be like me, everybody. Say hello to your neighbors. Buy like
00:26:37 a $1 fucking piece of bread or pie. Say hello. Give them as a warming present. Be friends.
00:26:42 Hello, Mr. Neighbor. Here's some Wonder Bread I purchased for you. Now, Queen Pieces James
00:26:47 are a slice of Wonder Bread. I would love to use you for your tabletop games, please.
00:26:51 I have one pallet of butter that I will also give you that you make smear on the bread.
00:26:57 Yeah. Unironically do that. Just go be friends and be nice and give gifts to people so then
00:27:01 you they'll like you. Yeah, it's better than being literally just like Stardew Valley. You just go
00:27:07 run around town with like a inventory full of eggs. Just give everyone one, just throw eggs
00:27:13 at people. Exactly, Ben. Egg for you. Egg for you. Everyone like egg.
00:27:22 In my experience. Yes, do that. I live in an urban hellscape,
00:27:26 but like the people who live in my house are generally pretty cool, it seems. So like,
00:27:30 get to know your neighbors. I mean, you literally know nothing about them and you've only stared
00:27:33 at them through windows. You remember that I got, you remember the time that I did Molly and then
00:27:39 knocked on my neighbor's door like, why aren't we friends? I mean, see, that's the wrong approach.
00:27:44 What a fucking moron. I also gazing through the window was also the wrong approach,
00:27:48 but there are good approaches to this sort of thing. If I had done what I did on some other day
00:27:53 and brought like a pie, then that would be fine. You'd make a friend for life. Everybody in the
00:27:57 voicemails are trying to ask us for advice on how to interact with like women or people in general.
00:28:02 Remember, this is the caliber of people you're talking to. Learn from our mistakes. This is what
00:28:05 we struggle with. Learn from our mistakes. This is, this is all fine. This is all fine.
00:28:09 What is this interest in brotherly love? I feel like this is like, I don't even, like,
00:28:14 this is so, people are not going to be able to relate to this because I think it's very
00:28:19 strange scenario to have your neighbors be someone you want to interact with in the modern world.
00:28:25 That's because the modern world is full of pussy ass, dumb ass, motherfucking bitches who think that
00:28:29 they can replace every relationship in their real life with like retarded online friendships
00:28:34 like this one I have with you guys. But really, you should actually get to know the people in
00:28:39 your immediate vicinity at least a little bit because it'll make your life, like I was saying,
00:28:43 I live in an urban hellscape and I don't know anyone and they're all scary potential murderers
00:28:47 or rapists on me. I mean, when Bernie Sanders gets elected and they institute the gulags and
00:28:53 come to take our guns away, like these are the people you're going to have to be like forming
00:28:57 a blockade on the street with to fight back against the federal government. Exactly. Exactly.
00:29:02 You better get those alliances sorted out now. It's funny you mentioned Tabletop because I started
00:29:07 playing D&D with one of my friends that I, from high school, he hit me up just like,
00:29:10 hey, I'm starting a D&D group because we've tried playing a couple times and I've really
00:29:14 panned out, but this time we've been going a couple of weeks and that's good. It gets me out of the
00:29:18 house and I'm like meeting people. But the weird thing is that like, he's like, all the people
00:29:22 we're playing with, they all are his work friends. So they're all just like talking about like,
00:29:28 isn't it crappy working for Comcast? And I'm just like, I don't understand any of this. And I feel
00:29:34 very odd. I think that more than anything else is that when, you know, the only people you can
00:29:40 potentially talk to all know each other on some level, such that the conversation is like,
00:29:46 almost 100%. Hey, do you remember that time where we did that thing? Oh yeah, let's talk about that
00:29:51 for 20 minutes. I don't have anything to say about these things. You gotta press through it.
00:29:55 These things can all be overcome with a little bit of grit. Oh, absolutely. I'm not like saying
00:29:59 it's like a total loss or anything. So I'm still going. I'm still having good time. But the problem
00:30:03 is just like, the vibes, you don't know what the vibes are. It's like, can I say retarded?
00:30:09 Because I will the character. That's every fucking day for me, Tom. That's literally every
00:30:12 conversation I have is I have to gauge, can I say retarded? And I wanted to make him like an
00:30:16 autistic retard. But nobody, I don't know the social cues. I don't know. Because my friend
00:30:22 is like a fucking like shit poster kind of guy who just like whatever. But like these people,
00:30:27 it's like, it's like his friend from work and his friend's wife. And I'm just like,
00:30:31 I don't know who any of you are. And I'm very afraid of being. You just, you just gotta swing
00:30:37 up in the door and say the n word. Oh, you're right. You're right. You're right. I gotta lay
00:30:41 down the baseline. It's true. It's true. What was I thinking? For real, like you gotta just like
00:30:46 say the things that you want to say, because all right, here are the two options for you.
00:30:50 Either be a little pussy bitch and don't say the things you want and get nothing out of the
00:30:54 relationship or say what you want and put them potentially hate you. And it doesn't even matter
00:30:59 because the, it's just where you're right back where you started. It doesn't even matter. It's
00:31:02 true. It's true. Losing these people as potential friends would not affect me in any way because
00:31:07 I don't care. It was like, it was like that legendary moment when I referred to PewDiePie
00:31:11 in my group of work friends as my nigga. And then their faces all fell and the total atmosphere
00:31:19 turned to mud right in front of me. And I learned what their boundary was. That's when I learned.
00:31:25 People in real life, they're not even fucking cool. You can't curate them. They're literally
00:31:29 pointless. All this shit about neighbors, all this shit about mean people. It's all stupid.
00:31:32 I mean, I don't need to go into why that I was really using that in a positive way. There was no,
00:31:37 yeah, I mean, you know what sucks like in situations like that though is that one or two
00:31:42 of them may have been okay with it, but they don't want to laugh along with you. Exactly.
00:31:47 Exactly. It's all fake. That is true. Everyone's fake. That's why you got to wait for after,
00:31:53 after that exchange, you know, in the cover of night on my work, you know, chat,
00:31:58 bot or whatever, I just get the word, just like the N word, just N word response from like one
00:32:04 of the co-workers who's trying to operate below enemy lines, behind enemy lines and, you know.
00:32:09 You just got to keep an eye on the one co-worker who just flashes through the okay sign and you
00:32:14 know that he's a fellow white supremacist. We found each other. Yes. Based. Now that's,
00:32:20 that's the good shit right there. Listen, there are so many people around you as a human being
00:32:26 and basically none of them matter to you. That doesn't mean that they're bad people. It doesn't mean
00:32:29 that they are NPCs that you have to mow down and get the extra high score with. It doesn't mean that
00:32:33 you have to sacrifice them for fuel and turn them into charcoal, but it does mean that like on the
00:32:38 internet, you can Google search group for spreading aids, get some bug catchers going on. It's great.
00:32:45 They call it the bug, bug, spreading. Bug chaser, bug chaser or whatever. Bug chasing,
00:32:49 that's the one. And that's great because you can now curate who you want to talk to. And you know,
00:32:53 of course, internet relationship is never going to be as full bodies, as robust as a real life
00:33:00 friendship, but it's better than real life friendships because most of them are born out
00:33:04 of convenience and most of the people you meet in real life suck because they aren't like you.
00:33:08 You want a good balance. You want a good balance of the people who you go with online.
00:33:12 My goal right now is to get more real life interactions. Now that I am able to walk and
00:33:17 move around again, I'm going to go out there and find people.
00:33:19 Tom, just get a fucking job, you idiot. Get a job. No, no, no, come on here.
00:33:25 They're going to look through my Twitter history and I'm never going to get hired anywhere. Are
00:33:29 you kidding me? Once in a while, once in a while, I do wonder if like, what if I just walk down the
00:33:34 street to like Whole Foods and was like, yeah, just let me be a cashier. Bro, they will do it
00:33:39 instantly and you will get $15 an hour. It is a good job. Like more just for something to do.
00:33:45 I'm absolute. I have been looking for jobs unironically, but I just hate the idea. It feels
00:33:49 disgusting. It's not disgusting because then you can actually do what you want and you won't have
00:33:54 to turn your art into a commodity to sell. That's the only thing I was just talking about.
00:33:58 Literally the only reason that I'm even considering it is that I'm so sick of trying and
00:34:03 found to be marketable. I hate it with all my soul. Right now, the grass sure looks greener
00:34:09 on the side of having a job to earn money and then just doing your art separately.
00:34:13 The real question is, the question really boils down to who do I want to be a slave to,
00:34:19 the public or the boss? Because that's really the only options.
00:34:23 I mean, right now, nothing in my life is sacred. When I was, you know, part-time YouTuber,
00:34:29 the YouTubing was mostly sacred except for what I like owed to my patrons. But you can just,
00:34:34 you know, Darth Vader, I have changed the deal. Pray I do not alter it further, you know, whatever
00:34:39 the fuck it is. And with your, you can renegotiate at any time with your patrons and they can just
00:34:44 leave. So, but unless you're depending on that income to survive, which certainly changes your
00:34:50 priorities and whatnot. So I mean, well, one day, these days, I may or may not go back to having
00:34:56 a full-time job, but I heavily encourage anybody who's like having a tough time reaching their
00:35:01 financial goals to have a job and then do their art stuff on the side. I think the biggest problem
00:35:06 with getting a job would be almost all jobs require you working on weekends, which means I lose all
00:35:11 my PCP money, in which case I only probably end up making like an extra $200 or something.
00:35:16 Well, that's not nothing, though. Well, surely there's going to be some job that leaves, you know,
00:35:19 Sundays at this time free. I mean, one could negotiate that, I would think.
00:35:24 I'm going to get a job, a stack and shit. I'm going to get a job going out into the world and
00:35:31 finding a bunch of crap and I'm going to stack it real high, real tall. I'm going to say,
00:35:37 please pay me and then I'm going to stack some more shit and I'm going to get cars and stack those.
00:35:43 They say make the job that you want, right? So just go out there and stack stuff, guys.
00:35:47 I'm going to stack some shit. I'm going to stack some shit and then the mother is like,
00:35:52 why are you stacking my children? You're like, I love to stack, please give me a $50.
00:35:58 I'm acquiring skills, guys. No, you say to them in a completely serious voice, give me 15 quid.
00:36:07 Give me some quid. I still don't understand British currency. It's like pints and quid and
00:36:15 pints, there's quid, there's 5s, 10s, 10s. Bob's.
00:36:21 10 Bob is like a word and you use it to refer to. This is why we fucking threw your tea in the
00:36:29 ocean. Hey, can I have some 25 schmlorp, please? Can you just define for me a quid and a pence?
00:36:34 A quid is a quarter. No, a quid is a fucking pound. A pound is a $50 note.
00:36:43 No, no, no, no, a quid is a fan. A quid is a fan. A pence is a pound.
00:36:49 Shut up, god damn it. You're not helping. All right, here's the easy way.
00:36:54 I'm ready to learn. A pence is a scent. Yes. They sound similar. They're the same thing. 100 of
00:37:01 them makes a pound or a quid. Five quid, five Bob note is usually to refer to the note. I don't
00:37:08 know what Bob comes from. Bob's your uncle, probably. A five quid is a five Bob note.
00:37:13 Five pound note is for us a buck. And hippo, how many aspects of a shield can constitutes a quid?
00:37:24 How many shield parts do you get? Like does it take? Isn't there only one part to a shield?
00:37:30 No, there's very many parts to a shield. You have to assume the shield. It's five of something.
00:37:35 The coins, the British coins have at some point in history, they started doing a thing where
00:37:44 they have some section of a shield. And if you arrange the coins, they make a full shield image.
00:37:51 I don't know how many there are. I think it's just all of the coins have a bit of it.
00:37:56 Huh. That's not how we say it. That's not how we say it.
00:38:07 Munchies English accent, just perfect. Just flawless.
00:38:09 Hey, speaking of cultural sensitivity, we can't keep changing topics. We can't just keep, oh,
00:38:14 I say something. Okay, that's cool. All right, next topic. We can't just like pivot back and
00:38:18 forth. There's no conversation here. Wait, shut the fuck up. No, here, I have to say something.
00:38:22 All right, I'm going to make an argument for interacting with society, not because society
00:38:27 is good, but specifically because society is bad, but you're opposed if you think society is bad
00:38:31 because you haven't engaged with society yet. So, you know, oh, smash cut to me back in 1908.
00:38:36 And I was hanging out, you know, I was playing video games and I thought,
00:38:39 being a normie sure is like bad. I sure was told that by someone at some point in my life.
00:38:45 Hey, can you pass the fucking loop? Can you pass the fucking anal beads? Bro, I need my kick.
00:38:50 And so I've come here. I've ventured out into the land of the real world, many, you know, for a while
00:38:56 now. I'm still doing it. I'm on the golden road. I'm on the golden ratio right now. And now I have
00:39:01 such a clarity of mind. I'm in like a Buddhist, like monk state right now. And I can finally
00:39:06 understand like, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. Normies are bad, but I have actual
00:39:11 reasons to believe it now. Like I have actual like experiences and I can actually, you know,
00:39:16 give arguments and I can actually understand why people say that in the first place.
00:39:19 I'm not building a pond because like, you know, I've only been the internet. I'm like,
00:39:23 the reason I hate normies is because I'm literally too anxious. I'm too anxious to go outside and
00:39:27 fucking talk to them because I'm a baby bitch. And I was told to hate them by people on YouTube
00:39:31 that I follow. And it's just, it just shows like a lack of moral character and lacks,
00:39:34 it shows a lack of convention because you're pairing what other people are saying. And you're
00:39:37 too anxious inside. By the way, if you have anxiety, I fucking hate you by the way. You
00:39:41 literally are like not trying hard enough. And you're only saying that you hate normies out of
00:39:46 fear. But once you actually, you know, interact with society, once you have a job or once you
00:39:50 go to school and once you're interacting with people in real life, then you will have the
00:39:53 legit ass opinion that normies are shit, but comma and space afterward.
00:39:57 That's fair. I mean, you shouldn't judge something to leave experience.
00:40:00 Speaking of real life, cool experiences. The, if you remember, I talked to a while ago about
00:40:06 the, the mission to walk in a straight line across the country of Wales, where that guy
00:40:11 with a GoPro on his head did that. Then he went back to making fucking
00:40:17 GeoGuessor videos, which sucked. And it was like, damn. But recently he has come back with an
00:40:22 incredible new and different adventure. He and his friend decided to try and get all the way
00:40:31 across Europe without using money to pay for transportation. And they would try to use as
00:40:39 many different modes of transportation as possible and talk to people to like, you know,
00:40:44 black their way through things and, and stuff like that. And he's got the whole series and it's
00:40:48 finished. And the doable, it sounds like a very doable thing to me. It's, it's a very doable
00:40:53 thing, but it's really doesn't, doesn't not spending money basically limit you to walking.
00:40:57 No, no, no. You can hitchhike people and like the things include sneaking onto trains and then
00:41:05 avoiding the ticket man hitchhiking. But I did that a bunch of times. They got some subscribers
00:41:12 to get them some kayaks and bikes for various portions of the trip. And a lot of wait, so
00:41:18 they can let other people buy them stuff. Well, I guess not buy them stuff. But like the point is,
00:41:23 I mean, it's worth it because kayaking is fun. Yeah, they went like through like this river
00:41:29 near the Alps and through Italy on these kayaks. And it was so cool. And, you know,
00:41:35 they would, they would slip on the land and eat off the land. And, you know, it was all very,
00:41:41 very interesting. And a lot of the cool interactions they had with random Europeans
00:41:46 was like some of the coolest and heartwarming stuff ever. It's, it, it made me realize that
00:41:53 as long as you are, you know, confident and nice, you can get people to do things for you.
00:42:00 We hear a lot of shit about how fucked up the world is, which is true.
00:42:03 Most people are good people and will just kind of be nice to you if you're nice to them. I
00:42:07 firmly believe this about the world. So I definitely recommend that whole series. It's very,
00:42:12 very good. But Gabe, I was just curious, what's the start and end point? Where did they start and
00:42:16 where did they end? Yeah, they started like Portugal and they go to like Russia, Ukraine or
00:42:24 Europe. It's like from, oh, what country is it? It's, I think, through either France or Italy.
00:42:34 I think it was near the Alps. They started somewhere there. But they got all the way over to
00:42:39 Bretislava in fucking, I can't remember the country's name, but Bretislava is a place.
00:42:47 Lithuanian or sometimes like, somewhere to the fucking east.
00:42:51 So it sounds like they were going south to north.
00:42:53 No, they were going sort of west to east-ish. I can't remember exactly.
00:42:57 Why would you start in Italy then? I don't fucking remember.
00:43:00 Because they're gay. They started in Portugal, those cows.
00:43:02 Yeah, it would be obvious.
00:43:03 Italy goes all the way up to the Alps. Maybe they started in Sicily or one of those,
00:43:09 you know, places down there, Florence or something. It would be very hard to start from Europe,
00:43:15 west to east, and start in Italy.
00:43:17 All right, whatever. I don't remember the actual country, but it doesn't matter.
00:43:21 It's a bad video, Gib. It's actually bad. That's the point.
00:43:24 The things that happen are really cool. And on the note of that, there's this other YouTuber,
00:43:30 I should find the, I can't remember his name at the moment, but he does train hopping videos.
00:43:35 Maybe I talked about this before. But basically, he is like the same sort of thing.
00:43:40 He's got a GoPro, but he's a complete criminal and he's got his face colored.
00:43:44 And basically, he goes on freight trains and hides inside them and knows how to illegally hop
00:43:54 on trains and avoid guards and he films it all. And there's such a freedom sort of
00:44:01 feeling you get from those. Because he has this hammock that he has to sleep in. He just finds,
00:44:08 like he climbs on top of a roof and hopes that nobody comes to see him. Because it's like,
00:44:14 nobody's going to go up there. So he just goes up on a roof and he makes a bed with a sleeping
00:44:19 bag. And then he goes back on the next train. He's trying to figure out which trains are going
00:44:24 what direction. And he's like, hops on the right train, avoids the guards. And then when the train
00:44:29 is in motion, he just climbs up the top because they have the little metal ladders. And he just
00:44:34 sort of surfs the train. He's got a GoPro on a stick and he's just sort of looking at the
00:44:39 beautiful scenery in the sunset. And he's just got the wind in his hair. And it's like the coolest
00:44:42 thing ever. What a life. Being free is really fucking epic, I think. You know what hippo,
00:44:48 that reminds me of a very liberating sort of feeling when you're in the physical world and
00:44:54 you are kinetically moving around the world. It's a very like, it's a revolution inside your
00:45:04 brain when you realize that you can jaywalk. And I don't mean jaywalking literally, although I do
00:45:10 mean jaywalking spiritually. When you realize that the rules and customs that you have been told
00:45:16 to abide by, you can just break them all the time and it doesn't matter. Bro, that's the main thing
00:45:22 that keeps when I was a shy young boy afraid to talk to girls, which it is still terrifying to do
00:45:27 to this day, no doubt about it. Like that right there, that social conditioning that like it's
00:45:32 not okay to just like say hello to someone was so beat into my brain, maybe entirely due to my own
00:45:37 retarded ass thinking and just watching anime all day. But then when I realized like, oh, it's
00:45:41 actually okay to do that and like say hello to people or whatever. Bit of a revolution, a bit
00:45:48 of a mind change. You can basically do like so much more than what people think is possible. Like
00:45:55 they have like very like hard ingrained like paths in front of them that they feel like they have
00:46:01 to abide by. But you can get away with like a bunch of like, I don't know, like illegal, literally
00:46:08 and socially things. Me and Ben held a slime protest. And I know there was a few people
00:46:15 that like not at the con, but I talked about it with some of my friends and they were like,
00:46:19 uh, are you sure? Don't you need like a permit? Oh, god, yeah, absolute the absolute cowardice of
00:46:26 some people that are like, oh, you're gonna get you're gonna get in trouble. You're gonna get in
00:46:30 trouble if you organize more than like 10 people in this like public park and like make some noise
00:46:37 during the day. People, as long as you don't cause problems, like things work out. Even if you do
00:46:41 post problems. I'm always, I'm always saying sorry I didn't realize. You should apply for a permit
00:46:45 before you do, before you publicly assemble anywhere public. What's that old saying they say?
00:46:50 It's always better to apologize than to like. It's ask for forgiveness, not for permission.
00:46:55 That's the one. That's the one. Yep. Better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission. It reminds
00:47:00 me of a time where I accidentally got myself into a situation that was illegal, but I was not in the
00:47:07 right mind frame to like deal with it. I thought I was going to die. I thought the police were going
00:47:11 to kill me. Um, it was just that I got onto a train and I didn't realize that I didn't swipe my,
00:47:17 my, my, uh, my ticket. Yeah. Yeah. Like I didn't, I didn't swipe the, the beep thing. And then I was
00:47:22 like, wait a minute. That's me every day. Wait a minute. When I get to the other end, when I get
00:47:26 to the other end of this train, I'm gonna have to swipe the thing to open the gate and they're
00:47:29 going to know that I didn't get on the train. They're going to fucking tackle me at the other end.
00:47:35 But like, uh, it doesn't matter because. Yeah, they just don't really care.
00:47:39 Like I did the, I pressed the thing and it's like, oh, it doesn't work.
00:47:43 And then this guy just opened it for me. It's like, there you go.
00:47:46 Law. There's an, there's an episode of, um, I think you say at Le Las Gare, the French cartoon
00:47:52 where the guy, a guy just hops the style or the till or whatever at the, at the subway station.
00:47:58 And the fucking like train bouncers like descend on him. And he decides that a way to get away
00:48:03 with it is to pretend that he's an American tourist who only speaks English. He's like, uh,
00:48:08 I saw the officer is first time I do it. And I think he gets his ass kicked. But my experience
00:48:14 is that nobody gives a shit. And even if you just openly run through the thing behind someone else
00:48:20 and don't swipe your card and are clearly just cheating the system, the worst that will happen
00:48:24 is like a guy in a T-jack. It will be like, sir, you get, you swipe your card, please.
00:48:29 Oh yeah, that happened that fucking last time we were in Boston. It might.
00:48:33 Oh yeah. It might genuinely white privilege that I might only get such mild responses
00:48:38 because I'm white and I look like a nerd. Perhaps. We tried to go through the thing like
00:48:42 in the ticket of the train where you do the thing and then a bunch of people run through
00:48:46 while it's open. And then the guy saw it and it's like, uh, could you, could you not do that?
00:48:51 But like nothing happens. Happens, you know? Yeah, no, nothing. Like, like he never drops.
00:48:56 People are scared of getting in trouble way too much. I think it might be brainwashing.
00:49:00 It's by design. It's by design, of course. I'm pretty like 99% sure it's like actual
00:49:04 like dumb brainwashing. Fear is what keeps the majority of society running.
00:49:07 Dude, I am always, I always watch like, you know, crime shows or whatever. And I'm like
00:49:12 amazed every time that I see like people do things like, like commit like armed robbery.
00:49:17 Look, I know these things are exaggerated to some degree and like, like do actual like,
00:49:21 I don't know, be drug traffickers. And then they're like out on bail and just like are allowed to
00:49:26 continue their lives. Look, not for the extreme stuff, I know, but like generally speaking,
00:49:31 you'll like be fine in a while. If you're a first time offender, you'll like be fine. If you do
00:49:36 most things. I mean, it takes money. Yeah, money, which can be a problem for you. But like, yeah,
00:49:40 it doesn't end your life. And that's, we were definitely taught to like what they say that
00:49:45 like the middle of the, like the poor exists to create fear in the middle class to like,
00:49:50 you know, to sustain the upper class, they say or whatever. And then like, it's the same with
00:49:54 like criminals, like the hardcore crime and jails, whatever, like exist to scare people straight.
00:49:59 So that they're like terrified, like a fucking Tom in the boondocks scared of getting annually
00:50:03 raped in jail. I mean, he's the perfect example of like, that's a legit fear. Okay, sure. Sure.
00:50:08 Says Tom, I mean, from the boondocks, what if it's, what if it feels good? What if you like it?
00:50:12 What if you turn gay in his soul? I identified very strongly with that scene. Okay.
00:50:18 That is another Tom. That is, you know, I do too. I do too. But you know, speaking of like,
00:50:22 absolute, like small brained, like peanut, like regressed in the mind, childlike thinking idiots,
00:50:28 my girlfriend, Michelle is absolutely terrified of jaywalking. Because in Hawaii, yeah, because in
00:50:36 Hawaii, jaywalking is like considered, I guess I can't blame her, like an actual serious crime,
00:50:42 sort of like they actually prosecute people who jaywalk. In Boston, you're just expected to.
00:50:47 Yeah, no, that's the thing. I mean, I've been to New York and Boston, Philly and all over the
00:50:51 fucking place. And like, I jaywalk 24 seven, 365 and nobody gives a shit. But I guess in Hawaii,
00:50:58 they're like anti-curtle touchings for some reason, I still don't understand why. You get
00:51:01 arrested in Boston for not jaywalking because you're holding up foot traffic. It's because the
00:51:06 traffic in Hawaii is so bad because island, et cetera, et cetera, that like they really
00:51:10 take traffic violation seriously, I guess. I guess like LA or something. Ridiculous. But I mean,
00:51:14 Jesus Christ, her poor brain has been absolutely destroyed by fear of jaywalking. And she could
00:51:20 definitely get away with it most of the time. And I try, what I'm trying to say is long story
00:51:24 short, all this commit crimes. I'm telling you to commit crimes. I'm at the point where I'm starting,
00:51:28 I'm at the point where I'm starting to wondering, is shoplifting really illegal? Like is it really?
00:51:33 Ben does it every single fucking day. Ben shoplifts every single fucking day.
00:51:39 You can literally. Well, here's the thing. This is what made me start thinking about this. I was
00:51:44 at Best Buy a few days ago and like they had like all the video games, right? And all the games are
00:51:49 like in like these fucking theft proof containers and everything. Then they had the bargain bin,
00:51:54 where it's just like a bunch of games just in plastic wrap. I'm like, are they just telling
00:51:57 me it's okay to take these ones? Do they just want them gone? And I just take a copy of Monster
00:52:02 Hunter World and just bail. Here's your homework for next week. Tom,
00:52:06 I'm literally going to tell you what you have to do. Ask this recording, go to Best Buy,
00:52:10 pick up a video game, walk out of the store. Like just start running, just fucking run out of the
00:52:14 store. They're not allowed to chase you. Wait, hold on. Video games have like the little metal
00:52:19 tag in them that sometimes the sensors detect. Well, that's the whole thing. And the bargain bin
00:52:24 ones, it's just plastic wrap. And that's why I'm just like, are these like the okay to steal ones?
00:52:30 That's how I'm interpreting it right now. You know me boys and girls. I am, in fact,
00:52:35 actually a straight edge. But like jaywalking is actually a victimless crime, 99% of the time.
00:52:44 The thing about shop, well, Nate, so is like not wearing your seat belt, but that's illegal.
00:52:49 Okay, true. True. Are we divided each individually? I don't know. I mean, if the law on the book,
00:52:54 if like draconian enforcement of traffic laws like leads to like significantly reduced like
00:53:01 death tolls or whatever, then like, I'd support it. Here's the thing about shoplifting,
00:53:08 like imagine that you are a minimum wage fucking work or you're any fucking drone working the
00:53:14 floor of a supermarket or something. And you see someone like pocket something and walk out the door
00:53:21 with it. What are you going to do? Are you going to run after that person like sir, sir,
00:53:26 you need to stop sir. And then when they don't fucking tackle them and risk your life and limb
00:53:31 to defend your employer's property. No, of course, no, no, no, no, give a shit. I mean, maybe it
00:53:35 depends. If you're in fucking Texas, maybe they have different state laws, like I don't know. But
00:53:38 I worked in Massachusetts at a Best Buy. I knew the security guys, I will tell you what they do.
00:53:43 First of all, they are not allowed to even attempt to stop you in any way. They maybe would speak
00:53:50 to you or maybe say like, please don't leave. You would have to be like a police officer to have
00:53:55 that like that thing that calling the cops is the most they can do. So if you're just letting
00:54:01 you know, you can definitely be out of there. But here's the thing, if you come back later,
00:54:05 they will like call the cops if you show up again. So you got to live your life on the road.
00:54:09 That's what you got to do if you want to live this way. I got my $20 copy of Monster Hunter
00:54:14 World for free. It was all worth it. Right, right. Today, I went on a school project.
00:54:20 Well, I wanted us out of the house and I was researching architecture.
00:54:23 Don't move on. I just wanted to say a quick jaywalking thing that was funny while it was
00:54:29 relevant that sometimes like when it's quiet, the roads are quiet. I realized that I don't have to
00:54:35 walk on one side of you know, on the pavement and then cross over to the other side if I need to. I
00:54:40 can walk straight down the middle of the road all the way down. And when I do that, I suddenly
00:54:44 like things like buildings, they start feeling like platforms. I start feeling like I can jump
00:54:49 over them and I can climb all over them and I become like, this is just a 3D model. This is
00:54:54 all just fake and I can jump and do all this cool shit. You're literally a god when you do that.
00:54:59 You activated the god mode. When it was snowy, I would walk in the middle of the road because
00:55:02 like tire tracks would have like cleared more of the snow out of the way. So I would like have less
00:55:06 snow to walk through. No, there's like genuinely like a state of mind that you enter. At least
00:55:11 I feel this way. I remember very distinctly when I came into being and I was in school and I was
00:55:16 walking in class and I thought to myself, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. I'm supposed
00:55:20 to go to class right now. That's what my body is like telling me. My mind is telling me I need to do.
00:55:24 But like I could just not. Like I could just like leave. I could just leave the campus right now.
00:55:32 And it was like, people don't think their body is their own. People think the way things are right
00:55:38 now. How about when you get to college, the reality says when you get to college and it's like,
00:55:41 wait, wait, I don't have to ask for permission to go to the bathroom anymore. What? Maybe Munchie,
00:55:47 since you did whatever it was, the weird school for retards and idiots as I understand it.
00:55:52 Dude, wait. Wait, what? I did what now? No, I said Munchie. Didn't I say Munchie? I meant to say
00:55:59 yeah, whatever it was. Nate, this is a quick aside. We're going to get back to the topic,
00:56:02 but I just want to say that you reminded me, as I was saying before, I was reading a history of
00:56:07 Boston, so you say Boston. And in that, there was a great little excerpt. Apparently, one of the
00:56:13 first schools for the disabled in United States of America, its name was the Massachusetts School
00:56:20 for the Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Uds. I mean, in the olden days, that was-
00:56:26 Xavier's rebranding was very interesting. Munchie, I was walking-
00:56:31 I want to be enlisted. Let me in. I was walking back to the food court or whatever,
00:56:35 because I'd left my bag and there's a building that I crossed that's called the Normal School.
00:56:39 Yeah, Boston Normal School, yep. Yeah, so I guess that's the opposite. That's like for the really
00:56:44 big brain kids is the Normal School. Yeah, and then you have the Idiotic and Feeble-Minded
00:56:48 Youth School. Sponsored by the Procrastinator's podcast. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But people
00:56:55 don't think their body and their mind is their own. People think that the way that the society is
00:56:59 right now is the only way that it can be. People have such an unimaginative, smooth brain approach
00:57:05 to critical thinking. But it's by design. I don't blame anyone for that. You've been conditioned
00:57:10 from birth to live in these lanes. Human life is conditioned to settle into a groove of life
00:57:17 that you come across. That just seems to be how the human brain works. And it's less energy to
00:57:22 do your routine as opposed to trying to mix things up. So it's understandable why you
00:57:26 fall into grooves, but you should always remember that you can change things up and do things
00:57:30 differently. I think one of the earliest times I realized crime is okay. This is not to get
00:57:36 political or anything, but this is how I feel every time I see someone saying that free college
00:57:41 and free healthcare is socialism. I understand, I understand. We only think that because we don't
00:57:46 already do them. If we already did those things, like with fire departments or public school,
00:57:52 you wouldn't have a problem with them. You would just think it's normal. It's just an
00:57:56 accident of history and circumstances that people feel like they'd need to rail against that kind
00:58:00 of thing. I want to brush up on that too, just because it's a very easy way to illustrate it.
00:58:05 But this goes to every single fucking aspect of human endeavor, where it's like some people think
00:58:11 that capitalism is one thing. It is one institution that, if implemented, is the same across all
00:58:19 countries. When things like that, capitalism doesn't exist in a concrete way. It represents
00:58:27 itself through policies and theories that are different in every single region and any place
00:58:32 that it is implemented in. People don't realize that things can be slightly different or you can
00:58:38 improve upon things in any way. All of how life is, it was made by other humans and it is all
00:58:47 the result of thousands of years of discussion. Capitalism can be taken away at any time if you
00:58:53 cross us. Literally exactly. Capitalism is not natural in the sense that this is just the way
00:59:01 that human beings have evolved naturally. It is the result of theories, the result of discussion,
00:59:07 it is the result of countless upon countless iterations of designs. People seem to think
00:59:13 that America, the countries that exist now, the systems that exist now, will simply exist in
00:59:19 perpetuity. And there's a natural state about it. Obviously, the United States exists. Obviously,
00:59:24 capitalism exists. Obviously, these are the ways that we do things because this is how they've
00:59:29 been since I was born. But even if you go double your lifetime back, things will start radically
00:59:36 getting different because the world is always changing. This is what I was saying at my first
00:59:41 point in this podcast. I don't know how to say it because I said it in a really obtuse way.
00:59:44 But it's like these sorts of things. Nothing is ever natural. Nothing is ever how it's supposed
00:59:50 to be. It's all just the result of circumstance and upon discussion and theory and evolution.
00:59:57 And this is the sort of thing where it's like people getting their little mind cage, their
01:00:02 neoliberal mind cage to quote Ben's lyric from under the city.
01:00:06 Dab, right. Neath the city is what the song is called, but close enough.
01:00:12 They don't understand that things can be different. And again, this is not just for
01:00:15 politics. This is just for, again, crossing the fucking road in the middle of the street,
01:00:21 in the middle of the road, instead of going to the pre-determined spots where you're supposed
01:00:25 to do it. Oh, I do that because that's what the lies. And there are these signs on the ground
01:00:30 that lead me to do that. That's what I'm told I'm supposed to do.
01:00:33 You're right. You're right. And the point is fuck cops do crime.
01:00:37 Yeah. Dare to dream, ladies and gentlemen, dare to dream of a McNook in every backyard and a slave
01:00:44 child harem to every man, to every property owning in my anarcho capitalist future that we
01:00:51 are heading towards one step at a time. Dare to dream. Dare to dream.
01:00:55 It's going to be great. People need to realize that like,
01:00:58 no, go ahead and hit me. I was going to say the first time I realized that crime was okay
01:01:04 was when I learned of the TV license that you're supposed to pay to make the BBC run.
01:01:13 And everyone I've ever talked to, old and young, has never, ever said they pay it.
01:01:18 Because there's no way to enforce it because the BBC is not the government exactly.
01:01:26 And they don't, they can't have a warrant to go into your house. And even if they know that
01:01:30 you're watching TV, they can't really do anything. There was this video I watched where this guy
01:01:35 explained the ways the BBC has tried to scare people into paying it because they can't actually
01:01:40 do anything to enforce this rule. And they said back in the 50s that they had this van
01:01:46 that would drive around with a television detecting like antenna. And it could tell
01:01:52 when, what channel you're watching and where, in what room. And then they would come to your
01:01:57 front door and say, Hey, you, you're watching TV without a license. And people like believed it
01:02:04 because they didn't realize the technology is impossible and cannot exist, especially in the
01:02:09 fucking 50s. And there has never been, like the BBC has kept up the life forever, even though
01:02:17 it's completely obvious to everyone that they don't have these things. Nobody's ever seen them.
01:02:21 Nobody's ever been convicted using one. It's just like a blatant scare tactic, but they have to,
01:02:26 they have to keep it up because nobody fucking pays the thing. Old, old people do, I think.
01:02:34 They probably do because they don't know any better. But like, have you guys seen
01:02:37 those videos on YouTube? There's a million of them of like, like, Professor confronts
01:02:41 entire classroom, who like one of them like stole the test answers. And like, he's chewing out the
01:02:47 whole room. And he's like, if you don't turn that in, that computer actually had like state
01:02:52 secrets on it, you could be serving 20 to life. If you don't confess to me, like these are real
01:02:57 things that were said. And what I like, this is a popular video. It's like a professor who's like
01:03:02 working with the government or something on some contracts, his laptop was stolen or something.
01:03:06 He had like the test answers, which is probably why they took it. But he's like, it also has,
01:03:09 you know, state secrets. And he's like laying on this case that like, if you don't turn it in,
01:03:14 like first of all, we're changing the test. So those answers you had, they're useless. Second of
01:03:18 all, you know, you'll go to jail if you don't turn in the computer. I'm the only one on the planet
01:03:23 who can help you, blah, blah, blah. I just feel like they're lying. And what I want to see is a
01:03:29 follow up video of how no one came forward and nothing bad happened to anyone. Not that I support
01:03:35 crime. I don't like crime of people stealing stuff. I'm against that. But what I also hate are these
01:03:40 overly self righteous displays about like, Oh, you're all, I'm going to scare the whole class.
01:03:45 You guys are so bad. The American everybody feel bad for like a couple of people doing some fucked
01:03:50 up shit. And I don't know, I like people who are acting tough to get slapped down. It amuses me
01:03:56 greatly. And I would love to see that some follow ups where nothing bad happened to anyone. And it
01:04:01 was totally fine. Last semester, I sometimes crime is good. I had an auditorium class and
01:04:08 apparently there had been issues taking attendance the previous year. And so instead of tapping
01:04:14 your badge on the door, like you were supposed to and the building was designed for people are
01:04:19 just tapping their badge and then like leaving like they weren't going to class. Sure. And so
01:04:24 the teacher lied to us. Yeah, I didn't lie that no one believed and was not effectual at all.
01:04:31 But it was so outrageous that I was funny. So what so he explained to us the first day, like,
01:04:37 you know, that doesn't work. You don't tap your badge. What happens is every single day that you
01:04:41 come in here, there is a photo taken of the class. And we have a team of volunteer students who go
01:04:49 through that photo and count each face individually to make sure that you were here every day.
01:04:54 Did he say where the camera was? No, he didn't. He didn't. He did not. Okay. And he said that in
01:05:01 order to get your face in the system, because I guess it was AI like helped, you had to send
01:05:07 him a photo of your face head on. And no one did that. And it didn't matter. And it just
01:05:13 resulted to like a piece of white paper being passed around every class with your yeah. Yeah.
01:05:21 I mean, when it comes to college, the system that should be done is you don't have to show up to
01:05:26 class. But if you fail the test, you fail the test and fuck you. That's your problem. Yeah,
01:05:29 that's that's the system that should be done. You know, my school specifically is very,
01:05:35 very handholdy. And in fact, you know, just just before you go in further that I think
01:05:40 not only should that be the system, I think attendance should be held against the professor,
01:05:44 because if a bunch of people aren't in your class and they still pass,
01:05:47 you are irrelevant and they're paying you for nothing. I guess that's true.
01:05:52 Okay, I, I almost have like a weird opinion of this where it's like, I think that you basically
01:05:59 should be able to like be free to do like whatever you want. In the sense that it's like, there are
01:06:04 like, you know, if you if you miss these couple classes, you fail the class if you did. Okay,
01:06:08 yeah, okay, it makes sense. I understand why they do it. But on some level, I think like, okay,
01:06:13 the point of college is that it's like a service that you are paying for and you get things out of
01:06:17 it. So like if you just skip class, like why would you penalize that person? Because they're
01:06:21 already being penalized by wasting a lot of money and not getting anything from it. I'll tell you
01:06:25 why the answer to that is because college has been watered down and they now are officially
01:06:29 recognizing it as a kindergarten where they're forcing you to actually give a shit when actually
01:06:33 nobody of those people don't actually give a shit. Yeah, the real university is in the YouTube
01:06:39 tutorials now. It's literally true because that's where all information lies and everything you
01:06:44 need to be successful as a human being pretty much. Yeah, you can't get a teacher on the internet
01:06:50 that can talk to you one on one, but maybe in the future, like you almost have that.
01:06:55 What is your hairstyle? Yeah. I mean, obviously, there's utility to having a class with an actual
01:07:00 professor with actual skills. I got it understood, but you know what I'm saying.
01:07:04 Break the condition you need to do in VR chat. Don't fucking think that anything is right in
01:07:08 VR chat. What if there were VR chats where like people actually, you know, like you're there as
01:07:13 your cat girl, a big, big, titty anime avatar and you're the teacher. You're teaching your students
01:07:19 about, you know, Physics 101 that you're trying on. I mean, that's too low-level. The thing is
01:07:24 really just like the same as a stream. Like the talking and like asking questions and getting
01:07:30 specific answers to those questions is what a physical human teacher is as an informational
01:07:37 dump. They don't have to, like if you're on the internet and you ask a question,
01:07:43 Google is terrible. Google is the worst search engine ever made, all of them are,
01:07:48 because if you have a specific question, it doesn't use AI to really tell you anything.
01:07:57 There are a few websites where you can put a question in and humans can come and
01:08:01 like answer it like in Quora or like other things like that. But like AI does not do good
01:08:08 like with the teaching. So like as long as there's like an actual person on the other end,
01:08:13 it doesn't matter where you are. If it's in real life, it's more real and like that's one thing.
01:08:19 But online, it can also happen. Like I don't know why
01:08:24 like teaching streams don't exist. They don't really, they don't really exist.
01:08:30 There's a couple of them. Maybe they do, but like I haven't seen enough of them to be like
01:08:33 ASMR guy. Organized as like a real thing. There happens to be this one ASMR guy named Chicho,
01:08:39 who I passively follow, not particularly closely or anything. And he does like ASMR math streams.
01:08:44 He like is a teacher and just in his ASMR, he's like, Oh, today we're going to discuss like
01:08:49 quadratic functions that we're going to, you know, break it down. So it's really clear.
01:08:52 You know, I mean, it's kind of cool. I've never really paid that. I've never learned anything
01:08:55 from watching ASMR. I mean ASMR, I think it's like distracting, surely. It's gonna put you to sleep
01:09:01 literally. Yeah. So I mean, there's also sort of like a different like skill set that a teacher has
01:09:11 rather than even sites like that, because learning does not consist of you just continuously asking
01:09:18 questions over and over and over again. That can allow you to create the sort of art that you want,
01:09:25 but it doesn't necessarily allow you to grow. And what I mean by that is that a lot of the time,
01:09:31 teachers can provide things for you that you would not know to seek out or that you would not know
01:09:36 to ask or just information that you didn't know was even relevant. Like there can be sometimes
01:09:40 where you are given not just an assignment, but you are given advice or you were talking to someone
01:09:47 and they inform you of something that you would have not known about otherwise. Like
01:09:51 for instance, a big thing I know in the illustration department here is that you are told that you
01:09:58 should know other illustrators in the field. And that's the sort of thing where it's like,
01:10:03 you probably know a lot of Instagram people, right? You follow a lot of people on social media.
01:10:08 How many actual working illustrators, how many people actually making money doing what you
01:10:15 want to do? How many of those do you know? Most of the time the classes are like a zero.
01:10:19 Like there's no one that I can name at all. And that's not the sort of thing that you would think
01:10:23 yourself well-drying. Like, hmm, I wonder who's an illustrator that I can take inspiration from.
01:10:30 You kind of just like learn things through osmosis. And that's the sort of thing where it's like,
01:10:34 you were given insight into the field, you were given insight into job opportunities,
01:10:39 you were given insight into how to improve your craft in ways that you could not just, you know,
01:10:43 think to or know by Google search and things. You mean like, you mean like a personal connection
01:10:49 no, as in like you've talked to them and know who you are? Well, either or, either or. Because
01:10:55 the way I was thinking about that is like, getting, that like the teacher, like talking to like a
01:11:02 faceless username, asking a question in a live stream or some VR chat thing, some future teacher
01:11:09 thing is like one thing. But like, if the teacher knows who you are and they can see you in real
01:11:14 life, that is something that like they can get a sense of what sort of person you are, what sort of
01:11:20 like issues you may have, depending on the teacher and how much they give a shit, of course. But
01:11:25 like, I've gotten some like real good life advice from art teachers in the past that see that like,
01:11:31 I am not like the most like talkative and like, you know, socially active member of the class,
01:11:39 I don't usually ask the questions when I was in school. So they would like, bring me aside after
01:11:43 a class and like talk about stuff. And those moments would be very valuable for someone like me.
01:11:51 Those kind of unquantifiable things that you don't expect are definitely the main point of
01:11:55 But is that really worth tens of thousands of currency?
01:12:01 Who knows? That's up to the individual to decide. I'd rather just find a teacher and like meet them
01:12:08 outside of teaching, just like be friends with them. We have to go back to the Greek model of one
01:12:16 you know, wise older man personally tutoring one sexy little boy. That's right. This is the purest
01:12:22 form of love. And it's the purest form of education as well. And it's what I ascribe to
01:12:28 instead of instead of paying instead of paying for you know, years of college at hundreds of
01:12:33 thousand dollars in debt, you just pay with your with your with your with your with that sexuality
01:12:37 you weren't using anyway. So you might as well put it to good use. Makes sense to me.
01:12:46 Hey, I've got an update a life update. I hit Twitch partner the other day.
01:12:52 Did you make it? Did it work? Well, I hit all the thresholds that are needed. The application is
01:12:57 currently being processed. I don't know if I'm going, I mean, I assume I will. They're gonna
01:13:01 pull up every time you said the F word on stream. Oh, they're gonna give me my social media score
01:13:08 breakdown. Damn it, China. What have you done? I really close to making I got pretty close to
01:13:13 making partner that one month that I had Chris Chan on my on my Twitch. And I also did the
01:13:19 didgy debate on like the same week or the same month. And like, yeah, I also I was close to
01:13:25 hitting that 75 average viewers, but I think I got to like 71 or something like 60, 60. Thank God,
01:13:31 it's I mean, hopefully it'll be over. And like, I don't think you'll lose partner,
01:13:34 even if your views dip down. Once you make it, I don't actually know what the benefits like,
01:13:40 I'm sure you get more emojis. That's the main one. I know your streams more successful. I don't
01:13:45 think you just get more emotes. Don't you get ad revenue? You get a bigger share of
01:13:51 ad revenue. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's pretty good. Yeah, that's like the big thing. That might be
01:13:57 like a 5% difference. I'll be curious to hear if like it leads to like any substantial like
01:14:02 change in your Twitch revenue. Yeah, I mean, for me, since like I'm kind of like right at the
01:14:07 border, like I could have been affiliate or a partner at roughly the place that I'm at,
01:14:10 I'll be interested to see because I always track my income for these things month to
01:14:14 month. Anyway, like if there's a change, you know, I don't know, we'll fucking see if that
01:14:18 if that amounts to anything, or if I get more viewers, or like maybe now that I'll be partner,
01:14:21 hopefully, like it'll put me out more recommendations and more people see. I don't know. I don't
01:14:26 know. Maybe. Hi guys, I've carved more space for myself underneath of a thumb of San Francisco
01:14:32 Tech Bros. I can't wait to sell my personality more online. That's it's good. I mean, that's the
01:14:41 job, man. That's the job. You just literally you just debunked every YouTuber on the planet and
01:14:47 every online content creator who exists. In fact, every book writer is just literally just selling
01:14:52 their fucking personality and like their hard one knowledge to the fucking ignorant masses,
01:14:57 like literally like a fucking whore, like a fucking whore. It's exactly what every book
01:15:01 writer in history is. Every, you know, the guys who write the Bible, you know what they say,
01:15:06 whores are better than others. Sad but true. You hate to see it.
01:15:09 Sad, but you hate to see it. You hate to see it. I mean, Christ taught us that whores are cool now,
01:15:14 so that's the good news. He did. I remember when he did that.
01:15:20 We should remake the Bible, but Jesus is like a vlogger and he like assembly, like he's like the
01:15:25 PCP. He like assembles a bunch of content creators. We should remake the Bible, but Jesus is a woman
01:15:30 of color. That's he's channel terminated. That was him getting crucified. Yeah, right, right.
01:15:39 That was the big, the big F in chat, as it's known in the book. And then, you know,
01:15:44 three days later, his account gets restored, but he kind of, he uploads some weird vlogs,
01:15:48 like you don't really understand it. The way in Bibles where they have like the extremely
01:15:51 flowery like first letter of the sentence, but just one page is a huge big F. Yeah.
01:15:57 Oh, it's like there's this really like finely detailed H and then TTP slash and then just a
01:16:04 really long link in that one episode of SpongeBob where SpongeBob is writing the essay to pass
01:16:08 voting school or whatever. Didn't he draw like it's him like, yes, yes. And he spends like an
01:16:13 hour and it's just a big W. I learned in voting school is was it a T. It's just just writes the
01:16:20 Oh, it was the. Okay. I was hoping it'd be a W. So that could be used for epic SpongeBob.
01:16:24 W memes like here, bro. You would see it everywhere by now if it was a W.
01:16:28 You're absolutely like every other SpongeBob's still, you know, ever produced. Let me see. Hey,
01:16:35 a totally other subject. I was just going to say I, in my personal life update, I have finished
01:16:41 finally Star Trek, the original series, and I'm on to Voyager now. And I'm so excited this piece
01:16:48 of media from the 1970s. 1960s as it would have it. But I'm sorry. That's actually based,
01:16:55 actually. Maybe it's in the 70s. I don't know. No, Voyager is from like the 90s. Well, the original
01:17:02 series. The original series is from the 60s. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, it was great. Really good.
01:17:08 Very excited to continue consuming media in this way. And yeah, it feels good. We'll give updates.
01:17:15 Yeah. I'll tell you, okay, the one thing, guys, I gotta tell you, a big problematic moment.
01:17:23 I've watched, you know, three full Star Trek series now. It's been all male captains. Well,
01:17:27 I mean, the Cisco Star is a commander, but it becomes a captain in Voyager. Janeway is the
01:17:33 only one I've seen so far who at any moment doubted herself and her leadership capabilities.
01:17:39 Is it a coincidence she's the woman captain? I don't know.
01:17:43 She's a pretty seasoned captain. Why would they choose to write this into her narrative?
01:17:46 Little suss, little suss, sexism in the writer's room? I hope not. Impossible. You
01:17:52 can't be racist and work on television shows. People can't be racist and sexist at the same time.
01:17:58 It doesn't add up. Yeah, that's, anyway, didn't matter. She's a good captain. She's all right.
01:18:04 Media to consume. Please consume the Lord of Ghost comic. Give and take dot sign.
01:18:09 Yeah, please. Lord of Ghost chapter two. It's another fucking masterpiece.
01:18:14 God, I love Lord of Ghost comic. When chapter three, Gib, give me more to consume.
01:18:19 I really like your shit. Thank you. I bring it up mostly to plug, but also because it is
01:18:26 something that I have sort of like slowed down quite a lot on working on. And I don't know whether,
01:18:33 like, it's a good thing that I don't feel bad about it. Like, I don't feel worried that I'm
01:18:37 losing pace. I just sort of stopped for a bit because I felt like it. And I felt okay.
01:18:43 And usually I would expect myself to be like panicking, like, oh, no,
01:18:46 deadlines that I set for myself are not going to be met. Lol, damn, kill myself. But I feel
01:18:53 all right. I feel like this was a break I needed to take. And I'm going to get back to it. But like,
01:19:00 do you ever feel that like you're taking a break and it doesn't feel like a bad thing?
01:19:05 Yes, because I literally never. No, okay, hippo, I'm totally with you. That is the sort of thing
01:19:12 where if you don't have a functioning brain, then you can kind of work yourself. I feel like I've
01:19:18 said this a thousand times before, go to munchuscripts.tumblr.com. If you think that your time
01:19:25 is always work time and it's always potential work time, then all breaks will feel like you are
01:19:30 wasting time that you could be spending. But as long as you are intentional and you like
01:19:34 plan to like, you know what, I'm kind of not feeling it right now, I'm going to take a break
01:19:39 and then you actually take a break and don't just, you know, have the Lord of Ghost, you know,
01:19:43 up in your Photoshop file and then watch YouTube for a little while, then click back to it and
01:19:46 then you draw like a couple more lines and click back to YouTube and you just waste your time that
01:19:50 way. It's great. I played Civ 5 for like six hours, like a couple days ago. I just got home from
01:19:58 school and I thought, you know what, I haven't played video games in a really long time. I'm
01:20:02 going to play a video game, played a video game and it was great. It was great. And I just,
01:20:07 that's the sort of thing where it's like, if I were thinking to myself, okay, all right,
01:20:11 I have stuff I have to do, I have to get it done and I have to do my homework, but I really want to
01:20:16 play Civ 5. I'm going to play a little bit of Civ 5 and then I'll do a little bit of work and then
01:20:21 Munchy, it sounds so good to be mentally healthy. Yeah, I know. I can't even imagine.
01:20:26 Well, it's almost like everyone can be mentally helpful, healthy if they just, you know, try
01:20:31 at all and put any thought into the actions that they're doing and just like reflect upon their
01:20:34 life and you know, just like set out rules for themselves and like have like a moral or like
01:20:38 intellectual standard that they keep themselves to and it's all, and everyone's like about the
01:20:42 same intelligence is about just about, you know, trying really at all. None of us would know anything
01:20:44 about that. That's, you know, it's, it was, it was weird though because it was like the first time
01:20:51 that I've been okay with taking a break. It wasn't even really a plan break. I just was not feeling
01:20:56 it. So I stopped for a bit and I played some video games. I watched YouTube and then I made,
01:21:03 oh no, it wasn't that. I finished the Sangetsuno Lion anime and read the manga, which is really good
01:21:11 and is definitely on par with the show. If you get to the end of the show and you want more,
01:21:17 definitely continue reading. Great manga, great, you know, art and stuff, but it's ongoing. So
01:21:23 it sort of stops and that after that I was like, dude, I don't know what to do, but then I got like
01:21:29 a block of wood and I made a shogi piece. I talked about this a bit. I have a picture now. I've sanded
01:21:34 it down. It looks really nice. I'm thinking of, of like maybe etching into it and then doing a
01:21:41 little image and then like painting it gold or white or something. Make like a pump like face,
01:21:47 like a little pumpkin head. Possible. That'd be cool. Not like the pumpkin outline, but like just
01:21:54 like the face, like a jack-o'-lantern face. I took a break for the purpose of being productive
01:22:01 in that when I hit the point where I was like, okay, finale's coming up for Slime and Punishment,
01:22:06 I was like, I'm not going to do anymore. I'm going to go back. I'm going to finish the vapor
01:22:10 scripts, which I finally did this past week. I got the last one done. All the guest artists
01:22:15 have their scripts now. So my work is done. Amazing. I felt really terrible while I was
01:22:21 taking the break because I felt like it was way too long. Because Writing the Vapors is like an
01:22:28 emotionally horrifying experience for me. As I talk about on the patreon.com slash ben saint,
01:22:35 the new monthly podcast, I went, I like had revelations about the topic of like, why is
01:22:41 Writing Vapors hard? Like while I was recording that. That's great stuff. That's cool. That's cool
01:22:47 to have moments like that. You should link it for us so we can listen to it for free and other
01:22:51 people have to pay for it. I guess I can do that just for you guys. I can do it guilt-free because
01:23:01 fair. I forget where I was going. Wait, can I just like post the, if I post the patreon link here,
01:23:06 you won't be able to see it, right? Even if I want to share with you guys.
01:23:10 Correct. We would need like, like if it's like a YouTube uploader, if it's on patreon we would
01:23:14 have to. I guess maybe I can just upload the raw audio. I mean, you certainly could. You
01:23:20 don't have to, but I mean, I'm curious. I will, I will figure out a way to let you guys hear it.
01:23:25 Okay. And the first one too, I guess. I was going to say on the subject of taking a break, I am going
01:23:32 on vacation tomorrow for like 11 days or whatever, going to Hawaii. And so that is indeed the first
01:23:39 like big, I mean, I spent like literally two days of the parents. So that's a weekend. That is one
01:23:45 weekend that I don't think that really counts as much of a vacation. Wait, our parents? Wait,
01:23:49 where are you going on vacation? Hawaii to see Michelle's folks. Okay. Okay. So that, I mean,
01:23:53 that's, I mean, we're going to be there for like a good solid like nine days of chilling. So that's
01:23:58 going to be an actual vacation that I'm very much looking forward to. What's the vacation?
01:24:02 Fun? I mean, we like had wanted to see my like her parents for a while and like a while back, we
01:24:09 haven't been there for a while to see her folks. And like they just said like, hey, you know,
01:24:13 like we will pay for you guys to come out like to fly out sometimes like let us know when's good.
01:24:18 And we were just like, let's pick a time that like fits into our schedule reasonably well. So
01:24:22 like they they're paying for the flight, which is very generous. And we're just going to go hang out
01:24:25 for several days. And then come back and continue life in beautiful sunny Cincinnati, Ohio. And so
01:24:33 yeah, I mean, there's no real occasion, but it'll actually be like a nice break. And you'll get to
01:24:37 see your folks and all that stuff. But like this happens to coincide obviously with all my channels
01:24:42 being hacked. And one of the worst things about that on the subject of, you know, holding yourself
01:24:48 to a deadline and whatnot is I had previously promised my patrons that I would get a big video
01:24:53 out during the month of January. It is now past the month of January. And I must admit I was had
01:25:00 had my head to the grindstone, working real hard to get it done, like my next big Nate video on
01:25:06 BGE. But when like the 22nd, the 23rd rolled around, and I discovered that my channels were
01:25:11 literally stolen. And I could not post them. I must admit, it just deflated me. And I was like,
01:25:17 well, I guess I'm just gonna not work on this as much because you know, dealing with some
01:25:22 shit right now. So you'd be able to upload to your patrons and you'd be able to upload as soon
01:25:26 as you got back or like whenever this resolved. Well, that's true. Like the video is not done
01:25:32 editing. It's going to be at least several more days of editing because I just was fucked up about
01:25:38 not being able to release it like on time. Like I could have probably finished it if I had had my
01:25:42 head to the fucking grindstone. But like for I had to deal with all these channels, you know,
01:25:47 there's work involved with that and stuff. But like it is, I mean, consider it a failure. I consider
01:25:52 it a failure. But it was due to circumstances that like, I don't know. I feel like that's totally
01:25:56 fair. Like even if you would put your nose to the grindstone, you got the video finished,
01:26:00 you still might have had to wait two weeks at this point to get it up. So like you can take time.
01:26:09 It would have been done, but like I can, I think it's not something to like work yourself up about
01:26:14 like, oh, I failed. Like this was out of your control. I mean, you know, people, my patrons are
01:26:21 the only people to the opinions I really care about on this particular subject because they're
01:26:25 the only ones I owe anything to. Actually it's not out of your control. It's entirely your fault.
01:26:29 Lol, die. I mean, you know, in a way, yes, in a way, you know, in the same way that like if you
01:26:35 get gunned down the street in a bad neighborhood, why are you in that bad neighborhood? I was in
01:26:39 the bad neighborhood of, you know, the internet and of, you know, sponsorship deals that I should
01:26:45 never have gone into. So that's, that's, that's on me. I don't know. I guess I just hope that my
01:26:50 patrons are a little bit understanding and they don't, you know, all of it. I mean, I suspect
01:26:56 they will, but like, I mean, if it was me, I have this thing in my head where it's like, well, I
01:27:00 mean, you didn't do what you said you were going to do. I mean, you know, you could have done it anyway.
01:27:04 So I mean, I can't blame people if they feel that way. I feel like like patrons specifically
01:27:11 would, would understand. Like random viewers, I'm not here to beg or anything promised it to
01:27:17 random viewers. They might like on serve or whatever, but like patrons care more. And so like
01:27:24 something like this happening that probably like really supportive. I mean, I would hope. I hope
01:27:28 so. And I mean, I do have a we Agua that's ready. It's been ready. It's just that my channel got
01:27:33 stolen. So I have one thing to release as soon as it comes. You're back on. This is that last one
01:27:38 that is the final way. Wait, you're not doing any more we Aguas ever? No, well, okay. That's not
01:27:43 what I'm trying. I'm trying like for now. This is the last of I'm calling it season three. Like,
01:27:46 I might pick it up again later, but like for now, the plans just work on the big videos and maybe
01:27:51 a we Agua if I feel like it, that's that's awesome. Yeah, I mean, I hope so. It'll just
01:27:57 hopefully make time for big videos and do stuff like that. But like, I was hoping to start off.
01:28:01 Well, there's been a little bit of a, you know, derailing of the plan. But okay, whatever, enough
01:28:05 about that. I just thought I'd throw that out there because it's like, I'm okay. What I was
01:28:09 going to say, the last thing on that is just like, I'm feeling good that like what I'm going to
01:28:12 Hawaii, I will just be tuned out of all this shit. Although I actually am going to call in for the
01:28:18 PCP episode from Hawaii. I'm going to bring a mic with me to do it. So I don't know, that'll be fun.
01:28:23 Hopefully have things to discuss. But like, I'm going to go as much as saying I'm going to use
01:28:28 my body, I'm going to go learn to surf. I'm going to go do that, which I've been, I mean, look over
01:28:31 at my fucking point break poster, and I'm just filled my eyes fill with tears at the sheer joy
01:28:37 of being a man on the ocean connecting with real life and doing real life things.
01:28:43 Yes. And so I'm just like, and you know, I'm hoping while I'm out, maybe I'll just get that call
01:28:48 from the boys at YouTube and they'll say, Nate, happy vacation, buddy. Here's your channel back.
01:28:54 We took care of it while you were off doing other things. And oh, won't that be nice. And
01:28:58 hopefully all the channels will be restored, but I'm going to be paying attention and all that
01:29:01 stuff. So I've excused myself for this like 10 day block of time to just not worry about all this
01:29:08 stuff. I worry about everything else when I'm back. And if I like, I definitely am afflicted with,
01:29:15 I am unable to stop thinking about all the things I have to do all the time. But when I block out
01:29:21 specifically, like a big chunk of time like this, when I won't be doing anything, I think this will
01:29:26 be a very, very helpful, recuperative block of time. So I don't know. That's it. Sick.
01:29:33 What's next? I got one like, bit of news, but it's not much. I put a new video on the hypocrite
01:29:41 channel. Oh, yeah. It's just a little five minute rant. And I was happy to see that the people
01:29:48 who have subscribed are still there, like very, very happy to see. Everyone was excited to see
01:29:54 that. Yeah. I was just really nice to like, I was expecting people to be like, what the fuck,
01:29:58 lol, die. I'm mad at you for uploading content. It's only a five minute rant and there's no
01:30:03 video editing. What the fuck? I care about standards, says the YouTube commenter. Redman is
01:30:07 looking jacked. Oh yeah, he's so angry about video games. It makes his blood boil. And he goes,
01:30:16 gear a second. You know what you're going to have to do? Yeah, I want you to go check that out.
01:30:23 Because I have like, banished YouTube forever. I've blocked it on my desktop and on my phone
01:30:31 and on my laptop and it's like, gone and I can't access it. The only way I can access it is if I
01:30:36 go to the school library. So whenever you, when any of you upload a video that's good, DM me and
01:30:42 then I'll go to the school library to watch it. Okay, we'll do. I'll keep you posted. I thought
01:30:46 you said like, completely blocking out something. It just doesn't work. Or do you actually feel like
01:30:52 YouTube has no value anymore? And so that's easy to do. I actually feel like it has no value and
01:30:57 it's easy to do. Yeah, I feel like that sometimes as well. Like I still enjoy looking at a couple
01:31:03 things, but it is sort of like the same video I've seen a few weeks ago. Well, I've got to be
01:31:09 fully redpilled on the YouTube. I've taken the full red YouTube pill, which is like 99%, probably
01:31:16 more than that, is just all people restating opinion that's the same as everyone else about
01:31:21 current event. That's like the vast majority of what it is. And in terms of like actually
01:31:26 insightful commentary, it's very rare. And but you know what? I aspire to be one of those people
01:31:33 that people actually be like, Oh, good. Thank God in the sea of garbage, a best guy ever upload,
01:31:38 I can count on this being at least interesting, at least something I haven't consumed a thousand
01:31:42 times before. I mean, if you're not doing that on YouTube, what's even the fucking point? Be your own
01:31:48 boss in a job saying the same thing as everybody else? How is that any better than just being a
01:31:53 corporate cog of some company where you make way more money and have actual job security?
01:31:58 Explain to me why that's a better job. You can't do it. So, you know, fuck it, man,
01:32:03 make good content or don't do it at all, or have it be a hobby. I guess if you want to do that,
01:32:07 that's fine too. Then do whatever the fuck you want. So much of YouTube is just like repeating
01:32:12 things like you're just saying, like not even just like repeating what other YouTubers have said,
01:32:15 but like reading a book and then boiling down that book to its like pure essence,
01:32:20 so you get none of the nuance and you get none of the actual interesting tidbits. So it's just like,
01:32:24 here's, here, I read a book, I'm just going to like repeat what the book said, but like worse
01:32:29 and like way like less insightful, you know, that's just what I'm going to do.
01:32:33 I'll just make, here's a little pitch, here's a little pitch about some, a video that I consider
01:32:37 worthwhile and I think it's why people like it. Like my, my smash videos, I do actual research
01:32:43 when I'm making one of those to find out like every appearance of a character.
01:32:48 Most people will have not know at least some of that. If you watch those, they're short,
01:32:51 they're punchy, they're hopefully funny and like they, I like to think at least they're actually
01:32:57 both interesting and amusing for people because I put a lot of fucking work into getting everything
01:33:03 I can and cramming in like every meme about that character. It's like a, I try to make it a full
01:33:09 like 360, everything you think about this character is all in one place and it's telling the story
01:33:15 of like a progression of something that would exist nowhere else. Like no one else has boiled
01:33:20 down the complete history of Simon Belmont, the character better than my sign of the cross video
01:33:26 about Simon Belmont getting into smash. In my humble opinion, it's, it's, it's making the world
01:33:31 like a better place. There's a thing here that did not exist anywhere else, except for I guess
01:33:36 a fucking like two hour history of Castlevania video, but you know what? I'm delivering it better
01:33:41 and faster and smarter. So fuck you, watch Mojo or whoever. I don't know. To me, that should be like
01:33:48 the bare minimum of what makes like actually worthwhile content. Now I consume lots of trash
01:33:53 content on YouTube too, absolutely true, but there's a distinction to be made and I know what
01:33:58 side of that equation I want to be on long term. Here's the thing about like people using YouTube
01:34:05 as background or is quote unquote, stop doing that. That's fine. It's, it's, it is a stupid idea
01:34:12 because there is music that you could listen to instead music on Spotify or YouTube. If you're on
01:34:20 YouTube, you're likely to get distracted. But if you're on Spotify, it's just music or band camp
01:34:24 or whatever. I made a tweet a while ago saying, give me a band, I will go through their entire
01:34:30 discography and I will do that while I'm drawing and I've gotten through, I mean the band I'm on
01:34:38 at the moment is Uriah Heap and they have like 70 albums, so there's a lot of stuff. But the thing
01:34:43 that's great about music is that it doesn't have to be good music and it doesn't have to be music
01:34:47 you like, it just needs to be background noise, just like a YouTube video. You don't care about
01:34:52 what is happening in the YouTube video, you don't care if it's a good video or a bad video, but
01:34:57 you get so much more out of music than people talking when you're not listening to it that hard.
01:35:03 So it's like, if you have like hundreds, like there's so many replies to that tweet, everybody
01:35:08 wants you to listen to their favorite band and nobody ever listens to bands ever. I never listen
01:35:13 to music when people recommend it to me. But through this tweet and this desire to like replace
01:35:19 background noise from YouTube, I've listened to so much stuff and it's just, it's great. It's
01:35:26 really good. That's good. That's good. I was more productive when I was listening to music than
01:35:33 when I would put on like background noise YouTube videos like speedruns and stuff. Because you're
01:35:38 always going to switch back over to the YouTube video. You're always going to have that over.
01:35:43 ASMR Chads unite literally worthless trash content that's just regurgitated to create
01:35:48 new white noise that it's the most intellectual content for background noise there is.
01:35:54 Trust me, I'm a doctor.
01:35:57 Part of the reason why, again, viewers read Munchie scripts, because I talk about all this
01:36:03 extensively and I'm probably going to post there more than I'm going to be on the podcast.
01:36:09 Like I say that like, you know, you can't block out things completely. But the reasons I gave is
01:36:13 just because like for some things, like, you know, I'm sure a lot of people are like really
01:36:17 addicted to YouTube, like how I was. And a lot of people like don't think as radically as we made
01:36:23 that, you know, it's all shit. It's all bad. Like don't even watch it. I'm sure a lot of people
01:36:27 have like a lot of joy that comes from YouTube. I'm sure a lot of people have like, you know, like,
01:36:31 oh, I really want to tune in to see this or subscribe. So like, like line just like cutting
01:36:35 out something completely is just going to like cause more problems because you're lying to yourself.
01:36:41 If you're as honest with yourself as I have tried to be and I've said to myself and I've
01:36:44 analyzed, hmm, does YouTube give me any joy? No. Okay. All right. Great. Okay. I don't need it
01:36:51 anymore at all then. And so that's fair enough. I think that they're like Marie Kondo speaking
01:36:58 of sparking joy. Yes, it's true. Throw away everything that doesn't give true joy. There are
01:37:03 creators who I would drop everything to go watch. For example, Twin Perfect uploading this gigantic
01:37:08 four and a half hour video on, you know, Twin Peaks season three and the whole thing. I know
01:37:15 that that video which took over a year to make is worth watching. I know it and that's why I'm
01:37:21 setting aside time to watch Twin Peaks so that I can go consume this media. And yes, it's just
01:37:25 going to be a breakdown, but it will also be an exercise in further understanding a media piece
01:37:31 that I would think is worth spending some time to digest anyway. So I would absolutely not agree
01:37:37 that it's all trash, but you do have to sort through the trash to find the good. And I would
01:37:42 totally agree. There's very little actually good. Yeah, like specifically, like, watch the challenge
01:37:48 you want to watch and subscribe from everybody that doesn't bring you joy every single time,
01:37:52 but like specifically for like if you're going to YouTube bar, turn off autoplay. If you're going
01:37:57 to YouTube for background noise, there's better things. There's way better things. And if you're
01:38:02 making a calculation that like by having YouTube, maybe there are once in a blue moon an actually
01:38:07 good video, but you know that you're wasting hours every day. So it's just not worth it. That's fine.
01:38:12 That's a totally fair calculation to make to, you know, turn it off. Yeah, fair enough, fair
01:38:17 enough. Guys, voicemails, voicemails, what do you say? I got shit I wanted to talk about.
01:38:23 Y'all are so fucking boring, though. You just keep going. What are we even talking about? YouTube,
01:38:28 fuck it. Say your stuff then. Amuse me then, Ben. Amuse me. Okay, well, get ready for disappointment.
01:38:35 I'm ready. Okay, scramble for my notes. Tomorrow, Iowa caucuses. Today's the Super Bowl. I don't
01:38:45 give a fuck. Tomorrow, the Iowa caucuses and I'm fucking high. Well, boring, Ben. This sucks so bad.
01:38:50 Why are we going to the topic? It fucking sucks so bad. Wow, it's terrible. Is that relative to when
01:38:55 they hear this or like relative to what's important? No, it is tomorrow for us. It will have already
01:38:58 happened when the episode comes out. Wow, great. This is really great podcast content. I don't know
01:39:03 if you're being sarcastic or not, Munchy. Just explain the joke to me. I think now he is being
01:39:07 sarcastic at this point. Yes. Okay, sick. Whatever. Fuck you. Okay, I'm going to hide from a man,
01:39:16 Bernie. I mean, the difference now is that it's not just idle talk about like political boys
01:39:21 going to be better. Now it's like, okay, it actually matters. The voting starts fucking tomorrow.
01:39:26 Yeah. I'm certainly interested to see where it's going to go. This does in fact impact our lives,
01:39:31 at least a little bit. It does. Bernie's been, Bernie's been surging lately. He's like,
01:39:37 top Biden in a lot of polls. Yeah, I don't know. Pretty good. The real challenge is,
01:39:43 will Ben have the moral fortitude to be gracious and victory? No. I hate my enemies.
01:39:50 Yeah, that's fair. Okay, whatever. That's the thing. I went clubbing on Saturday.
01:39:56 I got thrown out of the club. How'd it go?
01:40:02 I was, I mean, I guess, Kazzy's friend is like a bar promoter, and she was like,
01:40:09 hey, everybody come out to this club with me. And I got the second hand invite and I was like,
01:40:15 okay. Word. I mean, the long story short is we hung out at the bar and then they were like a dance
01:40:20 floor like opened up downstairs and I was down there, you know, drinking white cloth seltzers,
01:40:25 being a cool guy. No doubt. I guess I decided it would be funny or I felt what I felt like doing
01:40:30 was like sitting down on the floor in front of the bar, right? In hindsight, I can understand why
01:40:37 they wouldn't want me doing that. But mercilessly, they descended upon me, like pick me up, like
01:40:45 carried me out of the fucking building and just like sat me down and outside and were like,
01:40:51 you're kicked out. And I'm like, what, can I rectify my behavior? Not one word of warning,
01:40:57 you're not getting back in. So I wait in line again, like I wait, I get back in line to try and
01:41:04 like just wait my way back to the front to like be like, hey, guys, sorry about the whole thing,
01:41:08 promise I won't do that again. But like my shit, so can I just get back in? And I'm waiting in line
01:41:13 in these two like Arab guys, they turn, I start talking to them about Naruto, they both love
01:41:18 Naruto. And I'm just like, yeah, whatever, I guess this will, I'm out here in my t-shirt in like
01:41:23 freezing cold weather. I guess this will pass the time while I wait for the line for to get back
01:41:27 in. But it's no use, they're like, you got kicked out, you were dipped up, no, I heard word, word
01:41:33 from the top down is that this guy is trouble. He's not getting anywhere near our establishment.
01:41:37 So I had to finally beg them like, put my debit card, please just give me my debit card. And they
01:41:41 did. And then we all, we all left, we left and it was, fuck those guys. But like, yeah, they have,
01:41:47 they had like the two guys, one on each side, like grabbing my shoulders, like physically moving,
01:41:52 and I'm just like, okay, I'm, I like went limp. I went like, I'm just, I'll just let destiny
01:41:59 take me wherever, wherever it needs to take me. I'm not going to fight it. So like, I mean, were
01:42:04 you like, you know, drunk or like making a scene? I was kind of drunk. I don't think I was making a
01:42:09 scene. I just, I sat down in front of the bar. And probably that is offensive to them because
01:42:15 they want, I was probably like, someone might have been considering going up to the bar and
01:42:19 getting a drink and be like, there's like a guy sitting in front of it. Like, I do understand
01:42:25 the problem. I do. Seems like a disproportionate reaction. It's, I was a little surprised.
01:42:31 Cassie was a little surprised. She like, she like came out and found me in line and was like,
01:42:35 what the fuck? Why did they kick you out? I'm like, I, I guess I was sitting down and we were just
01:42:39 like, well, fuck it. I guess we're leaving. And that's what happened. Clubbing is well munchy.
01:42:45 No, I did not. No, he got, he couldn't, it was, it's 21, 21 plus. Oh, 21. That's right. I forgot.
01:42:52 Yeah. All the, that's fun. All the, all the other, it was all friends of this, of this
01:42:59 Cassie's roommate person. Yeah. There was only one, there was one that I talked to and seemed
01:43:05 nice, but then she had a boyfriend, which I think should be illegal. But that's, that's
01:43:09 for another, that's for another day. I'm like that. That's fucked up. Yeah. It was pretty fucked up.
01:43:15 I don't, if she, if she has a boyfriend, why was she not wearing the veil?
01:43:19 That's exactly what I'm saying. Why was she not accompanied by at least one adult male
01:43:23 at least. For Pete's sake. For Pete's sake. It's shameful. Don't worry. Brannis gonna get
01:43:28 Sharia Laan soon. I'm looking forward to it. All my favorite things. Okay. I guess I'm done.
01:43:38 Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear it. Thank you very much. Look, I just want to keep everyone
01:43:42 updated on my, on my, my day to day, on my goings on. That's why I'm here. I'm on this podcast
01:43:48 to maintain a presence and like have been like talk about my life with a, with people that want
01:43:53 to hear it. That's what I'm here to maintain my profile. It's working. Yeah. You know what the
01:43:57 best podcast content is? It's not like a, it's not like a conversation between two people,
01:44:02 like, you know, contributing their like personalities to create like a new thing,
01:44:05 a conversation. It's just like rapid fire. Like, hello, it's me. I'm standing up now.
01:44:09 Oh, wow. This ride today. Huh? All right. You sit back down. Sorry. Hey, it's me,
01:44:12 the next guy. I also have like the exact same life. What do, what do personal
01:44:16 anecdotes from podcasters live? What place does such things have on a podcast?
01:44:21 Indeed. Yeah. This is the question. Can't, can't imagine. I like the discussions.
01:44:27 Okay. I think they were interesting. Fuck you. No. Pointless. I'm glad to hear it. I'm, I'm
01:44:33 invested in the Ben Saga of, I don't know, uh, this, this could be a segment. This could be a
01:44:38 segment of the, the, the Ben segment, the bit, like, like, what, like, what stupid, what stupid
01:44:43 thing did Ben do and get in trouble for it? Ben got, Ben got drunk and something happened.
01:44:50 It has been, has been a disproportionate amount of that lately.
01:44:54 Okay. What could it mean? Let's get to our voicemails now. We've got,
01:44:58 we've got them all lined up. They're ready to go. And I think, uh, wait,
01:45:04 here. Yes. Ready. Yeah. Okay. You guys got yours as well.
01:45:09 Yeah. By the way, so, okay. Of course, this is the voicemails speak pipe link down below in
01:45:13 the description. Leave us your voicemails. We will review them and play the good ones on the show.
01:45:17 And was there any disclaimer I was going to make? No, guess not. Okay. All right. Let's go right
01:45:21 into them. Let's start with number 00 Radcon Kickstarter date. Let's already have to say
01:45:27 one, two, three, go. Serious Inquiry lads. The Kickstarter ends on such a whack date.
01:45:39 Like, could you extend it a couple of days? Maybe maybe extend it to like that next Friday
01:45:44 or that next Saturday? I think it'd be. I agree that it ending on a Tuesday is kind of bad planning,
01:45:51 but I don't think there's anything we can do about it now. I, I, you know, in regard,
01:45:55 response to this, I did look into it to see if it could be changed. Anyway,
01:45:58 it cannot be changed based on Kickstarter or anything like that. It's locked in once you decide,
01:46:05 but the good news is just figure it out. Just fucking get together. And that's the good news.
01:46:11 Fortunately, you know, you can just go fuck yourself and deal with it. Yeah. That's, I feel
01:46:18 concerned slash watch and alert sites. It's radiation. Modern insight has an RBL value set by
01:46:26 in ETC.com software, which is the radiation background level. Radcon minus one equals RBL.
01:46:34 Radcon two equals rising. Radcon three equals elevated. Radcon four concern slash watch.
01:46:42 Hmm. Is this, uh, this must be like some spectrum for. When you search Radcon four,
01:46:48 that's what pops up. I want to know more. I want to know more. Um, all right,
01:46:54 next one. Let's just move right along here. We've got a monkey is calling in with another
01:46:59 voicemail. Here we have the same on the count of three combination of me and monkey. That's
01:47:03 right. I'm looking forward to hearing from him again. Uh, okay. Here we go. One, two, three, go.
01:47:09 So I'm really excited about the newest member of the PCP, Brad, um, Brad Garlinghouse.
01:47:16 Honestly, I've been following his content for years and I always thought he'd be a great fit
01:47:21 in the PCP. And I was just wondering how, uh, how this might affect Radcon because, um,
01:47:28 you know, I'd really like to see, even though, even though he's new, you know, maybe you guys
01:47:32 haven't met in person yet, but like, I'd like to see him at Radcon four. I'm wondering if we can get
01:47:36 a stretch call to make this happen. You know, maybe, maybe even, um, maybe make it Bradcon four.
01:47:42 I think, I think that would be a killer. All right. Um, and, uh, do you guys accept donations
01:47:48 and ripple? Cause that's the only currency I have now. Um, thanks. Can't, can't blame you.
01:47:53 It's going to the moon is what I hear. It's exploding. It's exploding in all directions.
01:47:58 Well, tell you what, monkey, uh, surprise announcement guys, we even have, in fact,
01:48:05 got Brad Garlinghouse confirmed to do a lecture at Radcon four in the flesh. He will be there.
01:48:14 Uh, at least, you know, we've been informed it's Brad. Uh, he may be replaced by a stunt double.
01:48:18 Finally. No, don't worry about that. It's going to be Brad. He's going to be there publicly to
01:48:21 an audience about the benefits of ripple. That's what we get. Here it is, boys. New stretch call.
01:48:27 This is real. Look on the website. It's there now for a new stretch call independent of all
01:48:31 the other stuff at $15,000. Brad Garlinghouse will do a paid appearance at Radcon four. He will be
01:48:38 there in the flesh. We guarantee it. You're going to be excited. Check the Kickstarter. We'll have
01:48:43 some more details there, but, uh, we are pushing about 13 K right now. So that's not, that's not
01:48:49 too K away. It's not, not, not too ridiculous. They are not too far by the time they hear this,
01:48:54 it's going to be like, uh, you're going to have like eight days left or eight, wait, nine, 10,
01:48:58 no, eight days, eight days or so. Should be plenty of time. So let's, let's get it, sis.
01:49:03 Let's get Brad at Radcon for, uh, Brad hashtag Brad at Rad.
01:49:09 Oh yeah. That's good. That's good. Uh, all right. That's real. Well, okay. Good news.
01:49:14 I think man is here to call in possibly calling in right now. Let's, let's give him the floor.
01:49:19 Here we go on the count of three. One, two, three, go.
01:49:23 Attention all Nate heads. Best guy ever needs your help to get his channels back and banish
01:49:31 the evil Brad Garling house back to the shadow realms of this, but he needs your credit card.
01:49:38 No, the three digits on the back and the expiration month and year.
01:49:44 Don't forget that you got to hurry. His subscriber count is falling down into the darkness.
01:49:52 Hmm. Hmm. I mean, there you go. Please give me your money. Would really appreciate that.
01:49:58 Brad, Brad G is the financial genius. You just need his, you need their credit card. I mean,
01:50:03 you're kind of, you're not going to spend it or anything. You just like need them.
01:50:06 Like I think that's like a math equation you can do if you like you add all of them and
01:50:09 like divide them by amount of like entries and you can get like a password to access your
01:50:13 category. Right. Right. No doubt. No doubt. All right. Let's go right on to our next one. We've
01:50:18 got Aldorn. Oh, no, sorry. What's a teen CP? What's a teen CP? All right. Let's find out.
01:50:25 The count of three. One, two, three, go. Hey, PCP. Long time listener. First time caller.
01:50:32 I'm black. I'm 15. I live in Massachusetts. I'm an eight head. All this information matters.
01:50:40 Because I lost my virginity and it's crazy because did you set 14 year olds could do it?
01:50:47 So I thought to myself, why can't I? And I did. Thoughts and opinions on the Grammys slash
01:50:54 Oscars and teen preferences. No joke. This is the worst voicemail we've ever gotten. No, no.
01:51:00 Ooh, an eight head, an African American. I mean, it started bad and it just got worse from there.
01:51:06 Yeah, that's too bad. What's your opinion about me losing my virginity?
01:51:11 I think that God doesn't smile upon it and neither do I. Let's move on to our next call.
01:51:16 All right, here we go. Next one. We got Aldorn is next on the count of three. Let's
01:51:20 blue Aldorn. One, two, three, go. Hey guys, I have a huge fucking problem. So huge, in fact,
01:51:27 that it could be considered the biggest problem in the universe. That being how much I love
01:51:33 Munchie and hate discord. I tried endless war. I swear to God, I gave it a fair shot,
01:51:39 but it just sucks shit so bad. With that in mind, I absolutely require more Munchie content.
01:51:46 Those episodes of stealing your dad, for example, would go a long way towards filling
01:51:50 the hole in my heart. But it seems like that's the sort of thing that will eventually happen.
01:51:56 And I just need to be patient for what I'm more concerned about is a little comic by the name of
01:52:01 Investigator. Did this thing ever materialize? I searched for it, but all I could find was a
01:52:06 Steam game by the same name. And that game looks fun, but it also doesn't seem like it was made
01:52:11 by Munchie. So where the fuck is Investigator? Please tell me it wasn't just fucking a thing.
01:52:17 This guy's out of the loop. Yeah, wow. Welcome to like 2017. I sort of resented because like, yeah,
01:52:24 you've said like many times like, yeah, that project is not, I'm not working on it anymore.
01:52:29 So like, where does this guy get off? Another public source announcement. Okay, but on the
01:52:33 positive side, everyone, Munchie, we have previously instigated and continue to encourage
01:52:39 a social media campaign to harass you on all mediums to release stealing your dad and whatever
01:52:45 other shit. Release those emails. Release it. Release the dads. We need them. You know what?
01:52:50 Actually, I've had a change of heart. You know, I'm going to do them right now. Wow,
01:52:55 this has accomplished a whole lot, guys. Well, I thought they were done and you were just waiting
01:52:59 to release them for no reason. Why would you think that? No, no. Ethan, Ethan's editing them for me
01:53:06 like a good boy and he still has it. Is he really being a good boy? I said on like the last BGP that
01:53:11 like Ethan is editing the stealing your dads. I am so clued in to the state of Munchie's content
01:53:18 right now. Okay, I guess I was out of the loop. Didn't you say the first two are edited? It's
01:53:21 the last one that's still waiting? No, he's doing like an intro for them. So I like technically
01:53:27 the videos themselves, I guess, are done, but he's waiting for an intro. And you know,
01:53:31 people may say to themselves, ah, but I don't care about the intro. I just want it to be released.
01:53:36 But I mean, I don't know. Ethan wants there to be an intro. I want there to be an intro.
01:53:40 I think it'd be cool. I owe you nothing. There's no reason for me to release them right now.
01:53:46 There's no reason for me to do that. I have no incentive to do so. Well, the social media campaign.
01:53:51 Hashtag finish the intro. Can we have them finished by Radcon 4 so we can have like
01:53:56 Radcon 4 viewing of Radcon 3 content? Yeah, sure, I guess so. I don't know, maybe.
01:54:02 Hey, somewhat unrelated, what's the status of the RFCK lecture?
01:54:08 Oh, that can literally just be released, can't it? I'm pretty sure. Is it done?
01:54:13 Well, no. Are you kidding me? No, Connor and Ethan like extensively talked about how they
01:54:18 wanted to edit it. They're probably working on it then. Okay. Oh, God, you guys don't know? Oh,
01:54:23 Jesus, I can tell nothing's been done. Well, how would I know? You can just tell.
01:54:26 Probably nothing has been done. I don't know. Who's in charge? What's it matter? It will come out
01:54:29 when it comes out. Oh, God, that's a nightmare of an attitude. Okay, anyway, let's just move on.
01:54:35 You know what? Everyone's just waiting tooth and nail to wait for this lecture to come out.
01:54:41 Everyone's just on the edge of their seats. I'm going to stop giving a shit eventually,
01:54:44 Munchy. That's why you get it done as fast as possible. No, it's fine. Why do you give a
01:54:47 shit right now? It's not out yet. The lecture would be better. The lecture would be better.
01:54:50 That question doesn't deserve a response. The lecture would be better with visual cues
01:54:55 and imagery added to show what we're talking about. It's worth it, obviously. This has to
01:55:02 be a meme. Okay, this guy. Oh, he tried Endless War, but where's the Munchy content? That's what
01:55:09 is the Munchy content. If he actually liked me, then he would be in Endless War.
01:55:13 Kind of. His grouping seems to be with Discord specifically. I don't know what that means.
01:55:17 I mean, if Endless War is not his bag, that's fine. I mean, we're all heartbroken about no
01:55:23 investigator, right? But you got to move on. Everyone's heartbroken that they have heard a
01:55:27 project name before and they knew that a piece of art was going to happen, that something was
01:55:33 going to happen, and then it didn't happen. Oh, I'm going to really mourn that.
01:55:37 It's really strange. Oh my God, Munchy. You didn't hype the project up for little years.
01:55:41 It's not about before the investigator, right? Munchy was just a guy who occasionally drew
01:55:47 some pony art and avatars, and he was funny. Now that Munchy is clearly doing things,
01:55:54 it doesn't matter. It was just exciting that Munchy was doing a project that was going to
01:55:58 be a creative thing. Endless War is way cooler than Investigator could ever be.
01:56:03 Unless you don't like Endless War. I mean, I think that Endless War is cool.
01:56:07 I can understand if comics are more someone's bag than a free MMORPG playable inside of Discord.
01:56:15 Just read the Lord of Ghosts. This is an Endless War comic.
01:56:18 Yeah. Just write Investigator within the confines of the Lord of Ghosts comic.
01:56:22 Dude, just release Investigator as a zine. Oh, there we go. Well, I can just outsource all the
01:56:28 imaging for it. That one person that just approached us at the cafeteria bit, and I can just
01:56:32 like, hey, dude, do you want to write for my zine? You want to draw for my zine, dude?
01:56:35 Oh, yeah, perfect. I remember that. Damn it, I said I got another voicemail here.
01:56:41 All right, next voicemail. This one. Yeah, fine. Okay. Okay, cool. You should be able
01:56:49 to solve this. All right, put on your thinking caps, people, and click on this on three. One,
01:56:53 two, three, go. If a crab and a half weigh a pound and a half, and the half crab weighs half as much
01:57:01 again as the whole crab, what do half of the whole crab and the whole of the half crab weigh?
01:57:07 Oh my god, just cut that out. Just wait, he said one crab, I don't know.
01:57:11 Well, he said that the half crab weighs half and again. So, does that mean that the half of a
01:57:17 crab weighs 1.5 times as much as the whole crab? Right, do I have that right?
01:57:24 I'm not going to lie. I could not follow all those words. I'm just lost. Okay, well,
01:57:29 unless he misspoke there. It equals voicemail. If the half crab weighs half and again as much
01:57:35 as the whole crab, then the half crab weighs 1.5 times. So, wait, so it's a pound and a half divided
01:57:45 by five, and then times two would be the half crab. No, times three would be the half crab.
01:57:51 Ben, tell me how about how you have a degree. Hold on. Hold on, I'm going to do it. I'm going
01:57:55 to do it. I'm almost there. Okay. 1.5 divided by five times three. Wait, what? No, hold on.
01:58:05 1.5 divided by five. Yeah, times, okay. The half, the half crab, wait, the half of the
01:58:13 whole crab weighs 0.9 pounds and the whole of the half crab, no. Wait, wait, what? The whole of the
01:58:22 half crab. I don't even know what that means. Oh, wait, there's like some rhetorical trickery
01:58:27 happening here. It's just the half crab. It's a whole and a half. No, no, okay, but the way he
01:58:31 said it, then like at the end he says the whole of the half crab and the half of the whole crab.
01:58:35 Okay, well, they both weigh 0.9 pounds because both of those phrases refer to the same thing.
01:58:40 Exactly. I.e. the half crab. There you go. That's our answer. Please let us know. Okay.
01:58:47 Clip that whole bit with the half crab. That was a mistake. I fucking did it.
01:58:52 Next voicemail. Okay, get ready for this. Wanna play Minecraft with us.jpeg on the count of three.
01:58:59 One, two, three, go. Hey, PCP heads, do you like Minecraft? Do you hate Minecraft,
01:59:05 but like Pokemon? Do you can be the very best like no one ever was? The PCP Minecraft server
01:59:10 wants you to come and rock our socks. Dig a shitty hole in the ground, level up in the
01:59:15 out and get rich, collect all the TMs, marvel at how Thosetamus doesn't sleep, mispronounce those
01:59:21 Timmy's name, catch an Entei or just fucking lousy with Entei's, come see Victory Road where
01:59:27 Seven Maniacs built their own continent to stage honorable combat. Wanna be the champion? Train
01:59:32 a team and start fighting people. Just say you're the champion and dare anyone to prove you wrong.
01:59:37 That's how Gary did it. You wanna be Gary, right? Hate Pokemon? Play the mods factorial
01:59:43 ripped off instead. Lay conveyors, grind minerals, smelt the whole world and build a monument to
01:59:48 your avarice. Wanna be a shitty wizard? We've got at least two brands of shitty wizardry.
01:59:55 Twist reality to your will. Become God and dare the world to oppose you. All on the PCP Minecraft server.
02:00:13 We're doing what do you call them? You wanna do another one this week or next week?
02:00:20 You guys can, I'm gonna be away. If I got time, yes.
02:00:26 I want in the comments of this video, here's what I want. I want everyone watching this video to fill
02:00:30 out a form. In the comments, okay, to differentiate your comments from the rest of the comments,
02:00:36 I want you to do the following. Do a hashtag, like a PCP head form. I wanna give me your age,
02:00:46 your gender, a short description of your bio, and then I want you to say something funny and I will
02:00:53 give results of this form and the data that I collected next time. Don't forget those three
02:00:56 wacky numbers in the back of mom's credit card. That's an important final addition.
02:01:01 Sounds good. Okay, great. Just the three on the back. If we don't have the ones on the front,
02:01:06 it doesn't even matter. The problem is American Express has four digits on the front of the
02:01:11 credit card. I mean, that's, wow, we gotta think about those guys too. All right, anyway, let's go
02:01:17 on to our next one. This is the number one hooligan, Fred and Shid warning. Okay, let's, I think I
02:01:25 may have misspelled this, but let's see what he has to say for us. All right, one, two, three, go.
02:01:32 This is a warning. Hool 3.0, the new formula. It has more probiotics, so when I consumed it a few
02:01:45 more times after the first, it made me really gassy, made me fart and shit, and it smelled horrible,
02:01:52 like even worse than the first time. Also for the keto boys, he'll black addition, 50% less
02:02:01 carbs for you. And it's also the 3.0. Black addition. Yeah, they have a black addition. Yeah,
02:02:08 that's the new kind. That sounds cool. Let me check that out. It still has, I think, 10 or 11 carbs
02:02:14 per shake. I mean, that's not zero. That's not a nightmare. That's not terrible. Can you maintain
02:02:20 ketosis? I bought some ice cream. I bought some halo top ice cream, which is low. It's low calorie
02:02:25 ice cream. Oh yeah, it's so good. But it also has a pretty low, it's like, it's like 20 grams of
02:02:30 sugar for like the whole pint. So you could eat like a bit in response. Yeah, that's right, that's
02:02:33 right. But I also got this other stuff called rebel, which is like four grams of carbs for a
02:02:38 whole pint. So like nothing. Damn, not bad. It's epic. All right, let's wrap it up here. We got
02:02:46 double Satan here, our final caller, double man. All right, let's get to it. Here we go. Three, two,
02:02:53 one, go. Hello, hello. I, I am, am double, double Satan, Satan. And, and I am, am here, here,
02:03:03 to, to tell, tell you, you, to, to suck, suck my, my double, double dick, dick all the way, way down,
02:03:11 down to, to double, double, hell, hell. Go, go, double, double, fuck, fuck yourself, yourself.
02:03:19 Especially, especially Ben, Ben, Saint, Saint. Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
02:03:28 Yeah, well, I mean, we got what was promised. I don't know why the double voice is so funny to me.
02:03:35 That was great. I loved it. So, so, go back again, double Satan. I feel like we're from
02:03:40 double God. Can double God call it? Is this like the new arch enemy to double Batman? It's gotta be
02:03:46 related to double Batman. The, maybe double Batman died and this is he went to double hell.
02:03:51 Well, when the double Batman died, Satan probably just like sucked him up and ate him like Kirby.
02:03:55 And uh, he got the double. This is his copy ability. I get it. It's like, like, like, like by the law of
02:04:02 conservation of doubleness, we know that there can't be two doubles at once. So, first say double
02:04:09 Satan to exist, double Batman had to end. Initially, I was imagining like it had two heads,
02:04:13 but the idea of him having a speech impediment, just saying it again. That's much more endearing.
02:04:21 All right, fuck it. That's the last voicemail, people. Speak, pipe, link down below. Leave us
02:04:25 more voicemails. They're always fun to listen to and leave. No, it's false. I'll make them good,
02:04:30 or you'll go straight to hell and I'll ignore you. That's it. So, hey, support the show,
02:04:35 patreon.com slash the procrastiners. We're not on our channel right now, but hopefully we will be
02:04:41 soon. That'll be nice. That'll be nice. Bonus episodes are still available. You can get them
02:04:48 from the patreon and they're going to be around and also on the on the discord, which you also get
02:04:52 access to for just $1 and for $5, get the bonus episodes. You know what is there's 34, including
02:04:58 a new one that just came out. There was a little comic talk, which me and Tom bombed into later
02:05:03 on. We talked about all kinds of stuff. It was a good time. It was a good time. So that's it. We'll
02:05:08 see you there. Follow us on Twitter for all updates. We'll let you know there updates of the
02:05:12 channel stats and all that stuff at TPCrastinators on Twitter. I would highly recommend you follow
02:05:17 that for any kind of updates if you want to know what the channel is doing. And that pretty much
02:05:20 sums it up right there. So we will see you soon. I'll be back next week calling in from a distant
02:05:26 location. Other than that, it should be a normal episode and looking forward to it, everybody.
02:05:30 All right. See you then next week. Radcon Force coming up everybody. 15,000 donation
02:05:36 dollar reduced. Let's get Brad Garlinghouse given a lecture. It's going to be incredible.
02:05:41 Check out the Kickstarter for all the details on that. I'm so afraid, but so tantalized of
02:05:45 Brad Garlinghouse. If we can just make all the kind of, if we can invest all our earnings
02:05:50 from the Radcon Kickstarter in Ripple, we'll go to the moon. Imagine it ladies and gentlemen,
02:05:56 all right, see you next week on the moon. See you then. Bye.
