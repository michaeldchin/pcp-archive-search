00:00:00 Hey, it's a new day. It's a brand new dawn. It's a new episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast
00:00:12 here on theprocrastinatorspodcast.com, not on YouTube. Because YouTube just keeps lying.
00:00:20 They just keep lying to us. They hate us. We're being oppressed. We are being cancelled. We've
00:00:27 been cancelled. This is cancel culture. We've been cancelled culture right now by YouTube.
00:00:32 They don't want us on their platform. We've been de-platformed. And for what? For being
00:00:36 based all the time. We are constantly punished on all sides for doing our job too well. We
00:00:43 are called The Pro Crastinators. We are professional Crastinators. And yet, we're constantly getting
00:00:53 shit from our audience for procrastinating. We're constantly getting shit from YouTube
00:00:59 for, I don't know, being on YouTube, which is again, our job. Just trying to do our fucking
00:01:09 job. We're just getting shit on all the time. Everyone says, oh, Ben, where's slime and punishment?
00:01:16 Ben, where's the finale? Where's the new Endless War update? When's the new season starting?
00:01:21 Where's Vapors 2? Where's the- Where's my parts for the rap? Where's the Kuzo Mega
00:01:27 Kickstarter? Where's the Radcon Light Novel? Where's the- Yeah, Radcon Road to Radcon for
00:01:33 part five. Where's the OVA? Where's the dojin? Where's the- Where's the- Where's the- Where'd
00:01:40 my $34,000 go? They cry and weep and gnash their teeth. You know, the problem with the
00:01:47 theory of the $34,000 is that it doesn't feel real yet, because none of us have gotten
00:01:52 any of the money. No. Presumably, Nate is just like holding it in like an offshore Swiss
00:01:58 bank account. It is like earmarked to be spent on stuff, to be spent on like- There were
00:02:06 too many- And none of us are getting any of it until we've done all the- There's too
00:02:09 much post-production cost and some of us haven't even- Some of us are so lazy, we haven't
00:02:15 even submitted our receipts from Radcon yet. Or maybe only one of us is that lazy.
00:02:22 That was the first thing I did. Mine was mostly for food and stuff.
00:02:27 I'm really bad about that kind of shit. I mean, but I'm good at like- The way I've been
00:02:32 filing taxes- I don't remember if I've been reimbursed. I'm not sure if I've been reimbursed
00:02:37 for like food. I hope so. Have you even had to file taxes in the last few years?
00:02:45 Yeah. Yeah, of course, everybody does. No, I've done my taxes every year. And in fact,
00:02:51 I was doing my taxes like two days ago, and I realized that you can just apply for an
00:02:56 extension and get it extended to like October. And I did. And they gave me the extension
00:03:03 in like immediately. And so now I don't have to do them until October. It's pretty sweet.
00:03:09 Do you end up owing the government money? Oh, yes. Yes. Because as a self-employed
00:03:16 person, if you work for an employer, a lot of times they withhold your taxes anyway.
00:03:22 And then sometimes you get a rebate. But for me, nothing gets withheld. So yeah, I always
00:03:28 don't- But do you get anything back from being low income?
00:03:34 There is a- There are certain- Self-employment is rough for taxes. There are- Yeah, there
00:03:44 are like low- There are limits. Like there is a certain allowance of a few thousand dollars.
00:03:51 I think it's up to like maybe like two or three or four thousand dollars where basically
00:03:56 that much of your income is like- I think it's two thousand something is not counted.
00:04:01 So like the first amount, it's like you don't get tax on that. But after that, there is
00:04:04 like a certain amount and I am above that. So I do get taxed normally on everything
00:04:09 beyond that amount. And actually, if we're talking about taxes and I don't mind, I mean,
00:04:16 I don't know what the audience thinks about tax talk. Personally, I don't find it boring.
00:04:20 But I was doing it- I'm always interested because I have tax problems.
00:04:27 Last year, you know, I did the Vapors 2 Kickstarter and I got the money from it. But I didn't-
00:04:33 I didn't have the book ready. Incidentally, I have the book ready now and I'm going to
00:04:38 be getting it printed like this week. Like the time has come. It's a miracle. But so
00:04:44 I didn't- I didn't spend it last year. So theoretically, I would have had to pay taxes
00:04:48 on the entire amount even though, you know, a lot of it has to go towards production.
00:04:53 And I was sweating that. I'm going to get overtaxed on this shit. But it turns out there
00:04:58 is something called the accrual method of accounting, which long story short, is basically
00:05:05 just you checking a box that says, I want to count my later expenses for earlier, please.
00:05:12 And if you just say you're using the accrual method, you are allowed to consider future
00:05:19 expenses incurred by a previous thing, a transaction, as though they occurred at the
00:05:24 moment they were incurred- though they occurred when they were incurred rather than when you
00:05:29 actually paid them. So I can do that. And I- so I'm glad I was able to delay paying
00:05:34 my taxes because now I don't have to do it until October. So by then I will have, you
00:05:40 know, printed the books, gotten all the rewards and stuff paid for the shipping and all, which
00:05:44 is probably going to be another thousand dollars or so. So I'll be able to mark all
00:05:47 that as expenses off of that Kickstarter money.
00:05:50 The money behind all this stuff is the way it moves is so much more complex than people
00:05:57 think about because it's like, you see, like, okay, well, they just got this money and then
00:06:01 they used it for this thing. And it's like, yeah, but you spend it incrementally over
00:06:07 the course of the entire creation of the thing. So it's like, you have this money, yes, but
00:06:13 this money is for this thing. And it continues to be for this thing.
00:06:18 And it's not, it's not your money. I mean, it's not, yeah, this is true for Vapors,
00:06:23 it's true for the PCP, Radcon, it's probably true for everything. It's not your money,
00:06:28 or it shouldn't be your money until you have fully done everything you were going to do
00:06:33 with it. And then you can be like, okay, okay, I can keep whatever's left over.
00:06:36 That's the problem.
00:07:07 You know, fixing your leg, but you also cannot complete the project until the leg is fixed,
00:07:13 that it's like, in that sense, the money, it would be going towards the project if it
00:07:19 was used to fix your leg, you know?
00:07:22 Yeah, sure. Well, that's kind of like, that's sort of like borrowing against yourself. Do
00:07:27 you know what I mean? Sure, you might find yourself in an emergency situation needing
00:07:33 that money for something other than what, you know, a new expense, right? That wasn't
00:07:39 accounted for. And then it's like, well, I need to spend the money on that. I will then
00:07:43 have less money for the things that I expected to pay for. But what else can I do? Sure.
00:07:47 I mean, it kind of, it puts you in a no-win situation where either you can say, okay,
00:07:54 well, this money is exclusively for this project. I will not use any of, I will not
00:07:58 dip into this funding to fix my leg. However, in order, if that is the case, then in order
00:08:04 to fix my leg, I will have to either incur a separate debt or I will have to like, you
00:08:13 know, have somehow work hard enough to have the money to just pay for it, you know, without
00:08:18 having to incur debt. Either way, you're saddling yourself with more work than the thing that
00:08:25 you're supposed to do, which in itself will postpone the thing that you're supposed to do.
00:08:30 So either you're postponing it because you're not using the money to fix yourself or you use
00:08:35 the money to fix yourself, the project, assumably can get, you know, further along. However, it
00:08:41 also now requires more funding as some of the funding was diverted to emergency relief, you
00:08:47 know. When you're like indie crowdfunded, going over budget just means that you're paying for
00:08:56 it. So if something happens and you end up over budget, that's just out of your pocket.
00:09:01 Right. And the onus always falls on you as a business person to have made a good decision
00:09:08 about knowing how much money you needed. And the fact of the matter is that indeed,
00:09:14 people have no fucking concept of how much money will be needed in most situations. Like,
00:09:20 and there's like, you'll go over budget every time. Well, there's an amount. There's an amount
00:09:26 that you know to account for. And then there's things that you just will not know to account for
00:09:32 until the time comes, either in terms of time, invest like for us on like Radcon four, it wasn't
00:09:40 we didn't fuck up on the money end of things. We fucked up on the time end of things, like
00:09:45 just overloading an amount of things that we thought we could do, get done in a shorter
00:09:50 amount of time than we could, you know, a little bit, a little bit. And even so, like, I mean,
00:09:55 some of the things are things that, you know, I don't think anybody expected to be done quickly,
00:09:59 like the OVA, like, obviously, the reason that's in the works is that there's a fucking animation
00:10:04 being made for it. Like, it's not because of us. It's because it's a big project that's in other
00:10:10 people's hands, you know. Well, it's, yeah, on the one hand, it's a big project that's in other
00:10:15 people's hands. On the other hand, we have never done a thing like that before. So we kind of had
00:10:21 to like discuss like, how are we going to go about doing this? And then like try and figure out
00:10:26 what's the best way people know we have not made it hit a patient before, you know, but like,
00:10:31 in terms of other things where it's like, okay, like the diss track, like the exact nature of how
00:10:38 we were going to do it, like, we didn't have a proper microphone set up to get like the song
00:10:45 done right at Radcon. We got a demo version done that we could record the music video against.
00:10:51 But like, there was not enough time to, you know, come back and record a proper studio version on
00:10:57 top of everything else that was going on. And so in the aftermath of that, it's like, okay, well,
00:11:01 now everybody has to go and find time on their own to, you know, record for this thing. And the
00:11:10 work wasn't over at that point. Exactly. The work was not all done within the time that was allotted
00:11:14 for the work to be done. And then like you and Tom also had to do, you know, like shipping and
00:11:20 product fulfillment, right? Making shirts and posters. Well, Tom did. I mean, all I had to do
00:11:25 was mail him the posters, which I did a week ago. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. But yeah,
00:11:32 so I mean, for Tom especially. But I mean, you know, we had a portion of the budget earmark to
00:11:36 like cover the estimate, the estimate, like I got paid for drawing the poster and, you know,
00:11:41 he's getting paid for like the the the chipping and the and the printing the stuff. Yeah. Yes.
00:11:47 It's very involved. And it has been like, like Radcon for the event lasted, you know, was it 10
00:11:53 days? Yeah. But like, in a very real sense, it's still it's still going on, like it's still in
00:12:01 the process of happening and unfolding. Well, that's how it was for all of them. I mean, like
00:12:05 with Radcon 2, it took so long. Yeah, Radcon 3 took a year. All of them. Radcon 3 took a year for
00:12:10 all the content to come out. I was still working on 10 paces and draw a year later. I think
00:12:16 Pleven the Weave took like a whole year for the whole season to come out. What the hell are you
00:12:21 stirring around? I'm glad you asked, did you? Oh, God. This is this is this is coffee. And this
00:12:29 is a half a pint, half a pint of mint chocolate chip keto ice cream mixed into it. Yes. I'm
00:12:35 glad you noticed that I was loudly stirring this cup so that you would ask me what was in it.
00:12:41 No, I'm I'm stirring it because I want to drink its contents because they're delicious. But I'm
00:12:45 very excited by this by this new recipe that I've started describe it. That's it. It's just
00:12:55 it's a it's a mason jar full of coffee that I dumped half a pint of low carb mint chocolate
00:13:00 chip ice cream into and mixed it up and I'm drinking it. Good. Oh, I put some stevia in there
00:13:07 too. I guess I was thinking what's the word there's a word for when you put ice cream in coffee. It
00:13:12 might be macchiato, but I'm not sure. So I think this is a keto, a keto macchiato.
00:13:19 A keto macchiato auto. Yes. Patent pending. How does it feel to me the most like you're like
00:13:32 you're like a budget version of an insufferable hipster.
00:13:36 Thanks, man. It's like I appreciate that. That's like what makes it it's it's like,
00:13:42 like you would just be like a douchebag. But the fact that you're doing it all on your own
00:13:47 gumption, like you made it entirely by yourself is so respectable that it's like, wow, he's really
00:13:52 putting effort into this fucking like. Yeah, I, I mean, sure, like, I started, I started ordering
00:14:02 out food like like two weeks ago, I went on a kick where I would order food all the time. Yeah.
00:14:08 And like, but then I realized like, oh my god, like with delivery fucking food,
00:14:13 like with delivery fees and like you got to tip your fucking delivery guy now, your door dash or
00:14:18 whatever. And it's like, it's like, it's like 25 fucking dollars to get a burger. I actually just
00:14:23 pay for the grub hub plus and door dash premium because of the fact that I have been ordering
00:14:29 so much that it is legitimately benefits me, especially because with grub hub plus,
00:14:34 every time you spend like 100 bucks or so, they give you like a $10 rebate or whatever. So
00:14:40 it's like, it's definitely a system that entraps you. It's like, if you could, if you can afford
00:14:47 to be in the system, then it is more affordable than trying to like just order from it regularly,
00:14:54 you know, but like, yeah, but you'd have to order enough for it to pay off. And then at that point,
00:15:00 you're spending a lot on eating out and you shouldn't be, but that's right. Yeah, that's what I did.
00:15:05 That's what I did with Instacart, which is like the grocery delivery service. They would normally
00:15:10 charge a fee per delivery. But if you do their, their like premium program, you know, deliveries
00:15:14 free for like a one time yearly fee, and I calculated it out. And it was like way cheaper
00:15:20 to just pay the yearly fee or it would have been, except that then I stopped using it because the
00:15:24 pandemic hit. Although I might go back to using it at some point. It's funny that you stopped with
00:15:30 the pandemic hit because I feel like a lot of them started with it. Well, they stopped delivering
00:15:36 for a while. So with, and that was bad, but then they pay for that. They should fucking rebate
00:15:41 you that period of time. Like, it was, it was actually a pretty brief. It was actually a pretty
00:15:48 brief period of time. I'm not that upset about it. But even on top of that, they don't, they don't
00:15:52 take a, they don't take EBT, which seems like a big oversight. Even Amazon, Amazon started taking
00:15:59 EBT recently, which is like a real game changer. So like since, since Instacart stop doesn't take
00:16:07 EBT. And since, you know, I don't want to fucking take public transit to like, Wegmans or something
00:16:14 which is cheaper. I've just been shopping for food at Whole Foods. And like, yes, I know that it is
00:16:20 more expensive to buy food from Whole Foods, but they take, it's close to me. So I don't have to
00:16:24 put myself in contact with people and they take EBT so I can spend my fucking government monopoly
00:16:29 money on it. Suckers. It's great. It's, it's, it is amazing. It's amazing. But ordering out, ordering
00:16:41 out. Groceries, you know, gotta do it. You know, it's a necessary expense. One must, one must.
00:16:47 Ordering out, I, I was like, I have to stop this. I don't care how good boneless,
00:16:52 buffalo wings from wings over are. I cannot, I cannot maintain this lifestyle. It's, it's,
00:16:58 it's especially if I were to like, I could technically afford it. But if I keep doing this,
00:17:03 I'm going to find myself at the end of next year, getting hit with that fucking tax and I'll be like,
00:17:07 oh shit, I forgot. Oh shit, I forgot. I'm a self-employed peon and I owe like fucking half
00:17:12 my fucking money that I made to the government and now I don't have it because I spend it on five
00:17:17 guys. Then how much variety is there in the stuff that you order? Because that's a big part of why
00:17:22 I order so much is that like, I just like to eat tons of different kinds of food. So it's like, you
00:17:28 know, um, in the stuff that I order, uh, well, I don't do it very often. I ordered, I ordered Indian
00:17:36 food. No, no, it was Greek food like a month ago and I didn't like it that much and I didn't think
00:17:42 it was worth the money. So I didn't order for a while and then someone in my house ordered
00:17:47 buffalo wings and I was like, yeah, I'll get in on that. And they were so good that I had like,
00:17:52 had to get some more. So I ordered a bunch more over the next week. So I guess there's not that
00:17:56 much, I guess there's not that much variety. I'll order food if like I get like a particular thing
00:18:02 that I'm like, I want some of this. I must have this.
00:18:05 Hearing you describe the way that you ate Greek food made me realize something because
00:18:11 I think that most, most Americans, they like, they just eat American food
00:18:19 like almost exclusively and then like once a month or so are like, oh, I'll mix it up. I'll like,
00:18:27 have some Mexican or like some Chinese or like some Thai food if I'm fucking really feeling
00:18:33 freaky. And like, this is very strange to me because like, I mean, when I was growing up,
00:18:40 I ate like nothing but TV dinners and bullshit and like, my mom became a vegetarian in like 2001
00:18:46 and her cooking just degraded over time because she doesn't eat what she's cooking. So she doesn't
00:18:52 give a fuck, you know, so like, and nobody else in the house could cook.
00:18:57 Imagine being a vegetarian mom and cooking for your non vegetarian family.
00:19:01 I don't blame her at all because, you know, I mean, it's just a hassle and, you know,
00:19:06 nobody really appreciates it or helps out. I respect it. I respect it that you would be like
00:19:11 principled enough to be like, I want to make the world a better place. I think being a vegetarian
00:19:16 is a good way to do that. But I don't believe in imposing my values on others. So I'm still
00:19:20 going to cook. I'm so I'm still going to cook me that I don't believe in. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You
00:19:26 know, if you're not eating the food, it's really hard to make it good, you know, and like, yeah.
00:19:32 So my mom has become a better chef, apparently now that she and my dad are both vegan, and she
00:19:37 could just make vegan dishes because obviously it's to their palate. I don't like almost any vegan
00:19:44 food. So I have a roommate who is a loose vegetarian. And I don't know. I don't think I don't think
00:19:51 I don't like the things he makes. And I but I don't think it's because it's vegetarian.
00:19:56 I think he just under salts everything. I think that's his problem. Yeah. If he just
00:20:01 fixed that, he'd be fine. I mean, it's always just a matter. I mean, I used to not even eat like
00:20:05 any kind of dish that did not have meat in it. It's like I did not even see the value of a dish
00:20:10 without meat until like May started cooking dishes that are like actually good, you know,
00:20:17 like not to say that she often makes up with no meat in it necessarily or that that's my favorite
00:20:22 shit, but it can be good, obviously. And like, sure, you don't we don't need to eat anywhere
00:20:28 close to as much meat as we do. You know, I think meat is good for you for the human experience,
00:20:34 but you don't have to eat it even every day, you know, no, to get to get the benefits necessary
00:20:40 from it. But like, but nonetheless, I'm a big time meat person. I like to eat a lot of fucking
00:20:46 meat if I can. But like same. And I tend to favor like just getting a sandwich, which is like no
00:20:54 fucking lettuce on it or anything like that. But like, I in terms of flavor palette, I'm interested
00:21:02 in a huge variety of styles of preparing meat, or you know, of putting it with other things. And
00:21:08 like, so much of American food is just meat plus lettuce, tomato, onion. And like, sure, not that
00:21:16 I'm not fine with those things, but I do not find that to be a very interesting flavor combination.
00:21:21 I don't like lettuce very much. I'm not a big fan of tomato. I put, I put love onion curry. I put
00:21:27 curry powder on my colleague on my steamed more sauteed. It's gonna half steamed half sauteed
00:21:32 cauliflower. I put curry powder on it the other day. I sprinkled some mozzarella on top. I don't
00:21:40 use curry powder very often, but this was like, Oh, it's perfect. Oh, it's beautiful. I tend to crave
00:21:45 like, I want to eat fucking onions and mushrooms and fucking peppers. And like, you know,
00:21:52 shit that would be in a curry, or shit that would be in a soup or something like that.
00:21:58 But also stuff that would be on a sandwich sometimes it's just like, I want to mix it up. I
00:22:02 want to be eating different stuff every day so that I know I'm getting like all the different
00:22:07 types of fucking nutrients, all the different types of immunities, you know, I want to be
00:22:12 fucking ready for any situation with through my body's fucking makeup. I want my body to have
00:22:18 evolved to deal with all kinds of different things, you know what I mean? And so, so I try to mix it
00:22:24 up. But like, you know, it's just funny because most of what you actually can get in America is
00:22:32 not like authentic cuisine from places. Like, like if you get Chinese food, almost all of them are
00:22:39 the same unionized Chinese American food, American idea of Chinese food. It's like Tex-Mex. Yeah,
00:22:47 like it's like Chinese. It's like, it's funny because it's funny because it's like Tex-Mex,
00:22:53 except that the Mexican restaurants are also like that in America. We're like, they're also like,
00:22:58 what we think of as like real Mexican food, i.e. not Taco Bell, like Mexican family restaurants are
00:23:04 also like generally the same unionized like template idea, like American idea of the Mexican
00:23:11 place where they're serving quesadillas, which are not even a Mexican invention, you know, like,
00:23:16 yeah. So I definitely add like a, I've definitely been to like one or two like pretty authentic
00:23:22 little like hole in the wall, like like Mexican place, like in California, I went to one or two.
00:23:28 There was a place near our house in Boston that was like, it was like an expensive sort of like
00:23:34 higher end place, but it was like much more like it was clearly Mexican food, like like someone
00:23:41 from Mexico making Mexican food, but like at a higher, you know, kind of class Mexican food.
00:23:46 So not necessarily like street Mexican food, but like it was not the same menu as what would be
00:23:53 at like a standard family restaurant, you know, and like there's a Chinese restaurant in my town
00:23:58 called Jade Villa that I highly recommend anybody who happens to be in Virginia Beach.
00:24:02 It's like right by town center and they actually have two menus. They have one that's like the
00:24:07 standard American Chinese menu and then they have the Chinese menu where it's like frog legs,
00:24:13 jellyfish, fucking, uh, you know, all kinds of crazy shit that is awesome and is stinky tofu.
00:24:20 They do not have stinky tofu, but we did go to that place that had it. Well,
00:24:24 actually they might, maybe I just didn't, I've never looked for it. Were you there, were you there
00:24:29 when econ got the stinky tofu at the place in China town? The story was told to me many times.
00:24:34 It's so bad, so disgusting. I can't believe it. You can't insist it's good though, so whatever.
00:24:43 I'm not like, no guys are free. Well, yeah, I'm at the end. I mean, I'm at the end.
00:24:47 He's a chocolate chips as well, you know, a cup, a cup. Yeah. Well, like literally. Well, did you,
00:24:54 okay, uh, he was on. Oh no, do we want to get into that? I mean, go ahead. I don't care. This is public.
00:24:59 He was on, okay. He came on Glinkstream. Do you know who Glink is?
00:25:04 Ah, fuck that guy. Yeah, I know. Yeah, you don't like that guy? Well, he was.
00:25:09 Not even a little bit. He was doing a live stream and econ went on there. Econ is pals with him.
00:25:17 And he, he was asked by somebody about his love of NTR porn. You know what NTR is, right?
00:25:28 Netsur, Netsurari. Yes. Yeah. Is that's like, that's getting cucked, right? Well, it's,
00:25:35 there's three perspectives on it. And as econ put it, he said that he is 30, he is spends
00:25:41 30% of the time in all three of the perspectives. So he gets off on being any of the three people
00:25:46 in the scenario, which is to say. Oh, sure. Yeah. The cuck, the cuck, the wife or the bull.
00:25:53 All three of them, he's into being all three. So. Oh no. Oh no, I can't, I can't hear anything.
00:25:58 Eleazar, Eleazar, cut this part. Okay. I'm back. You can, you can, you can roll another blunt if you
00:26:07 want. I don't care. Okay. Okay. But I'm back. So, so you mean, right, 30% bull, 30% cuck, 30% wife,
00:26:17 right? That's exactly. Sure. I totally get it. I totally get it. Yeah. So, you know,
00:26:23 as far as I'm concerned, if you're 30% cuck, you're a cuck. 30% cuck. Sure. Yeah, sure. Any
00:26:30 percent cuck is a cuck. It's like, it's like, it's like being white, you know, if any part, if
00:26:37 you're at all not white, if you have even a drop of non white, you're not white anymore, right?
00:26:40 If you have even a drop of cuck, you're no longer a bull. It's funny you say that because I think
00:26:45 that goes both ways with race. I think that if you're mixed at all, you're just mixed and like
00:26:50 nobody will have you, you know? Oh boy. I mean, it's like, there's a sect of people who do not
00:26:56 want to say, there's a sect of people who do not want to say that Obama was the first black
00:27:02 president because he is right because he's half white, half white. So, well, yeah, I mean, that,
00:27:07 I mean, it's a big, big topic. We won't get into all, we can't possibly cover it all. But like,
00:27:13 neither of us is really in a position to have a strong opinion about it. I guess that's what
00:27:16 we're trying to say. I mean, most people say that Obama was a black president, even though he is
00:27:22 demonstrably half white. But yeah, it's kind of a fringe position to say he's not black because
00:27:29 like, he's black because he looks black. And like, at the end of the day, when you get right down to
00:27:35 it, that's what race is. It's like, you can make like, you can claim some kind of genetic lineage
00:27:42 and like, yeah, maybe, but at the end of the day, what you really mean by white is just that you
00:27:46 look white and that's basically it. Then are you familiar with the rapper Logic? No. Okay, Logic
00:27:53 presents one of the most interesting scenarios in my mind because so Logic is is is is half black,
00:28:00 half white, I think. Yeah. And he raps a lot about being but being half and like not really
00:28:08 fitting in with either crowd, right? And there's a lot of people who talk about how they they
00:28:16 they're sick of hearing him talk about or they're sick of him sort of like talking about that
00:28:21 experience because of the fact that he doesn't really look black at all. And so it's like hard
00:28:27 to believe that he would have faced the same prejudice that they do. And when I think about
00:28:32 that, I'm like, well, aren't you exhibiting right now the prejudice that he is speaking about
00:28:38 in the songs by saying so. But at the same time, so before I ever saw what Logic looked like,
00:28:46 he does look, I mean, I can, I can kind of see it, right? Okay, I can kind of see it. He looked
00:28:51 like though, but he looks, he looks, he looks pretty white. Look up what he looks like in
00:28:55 Rick and Morty, though. This is really funny to me because I saw his appearance at Rick and Morty
00:28:59 before I knew what he looked like and assumed that he looked like this. And that made me think
00:29:06 like, oh, yeah, he looks like he's like mixed. He looks like he would be like considered a black guy.
00:29:12 But it's just funny because they present him as looking like especially mixed, but he doesn't.
00:29:16 He kind of looks way whiter than that in real life. They got his chin wrong. It's funny to me,
00:29:22 like the thing that looks the most black about him is like his hair. He's his like kind of like
00:29:27 curly hair. I mean, to me, they gave him like these big lips and like, he just kind of has like,
00:29:33 it kind of has like normal. I mean, I'm being, I'm being Eurocentric when I say normal white guy
00:29:39 lips, you know what I mean? I absolutely believe that like Logic has experienced what he talks about
00:29:45 because like, from my perspective as a white guy, I look at him and I think, well, he doesn't really
00:29:51 look white enough to fit in with white guys. Like I know that, you know, I don't know if black guys
00:29:57 know that, but I know that. But him the way he looks in real life. I think that a lot of black
00:30:02 people think that he wouldn't be singled out because he looks too white because, okay, black
00:30:08 people are very fixated on skin tone. Like in my experience in going to black school,
00:30:15 black kids talk about each other as like, oh, that light skinned guy, that dark skinned guy,
00:30:19 that mid-tone person, you know, they pay a lot of attention because they think that
00:30:25 there's like a sliding scale of privilege based on literally how dark you are. And the funny thing
00:30:31 is that in those communities, that is even more true because of the fact that people
00:30:35 perpetuate the stereotypes. Particularly African kids get bullied a lot in African American
00:30:42 communities. For being the darkest. Right. For being the darkest and for being just culturally
00:30:46 different, you know, because they're from Africa. Like I'm talking about literal like, you know,
00:30:50 kids who are from Africa who come over and trying to adapt. But like, you know, and I saw all of
00:30:57 this as myself an outsider at the school, but, you know, I was literally like a white kid from
00:31:03 the suburbs who just somehow ended up here, you know, so like, I didn't feel like I was,
00:31:08 I didn't feel like I was being singled out so much as just like, what the fuck is this person
00:31:12 doing here? They have nothing to do with the infrastructure of what's going on here, you know.
00:31:17 Infrastructure.
00:31:18 Yeah. But like, I look at logic and I think like, if this kid went to an all black school,
00:31:25 then they're going to treat him like a white kid. And if he went to an all white school,
00:31:30 they're going to treat him like a mixed kid. I know that would be the case because I went to
00:31:34 both and I've known kids who were mixed and I know how they're treated. It's kind of hard to
00:31:39 tell in some of these pictures, he looks completely white. And then in others, it's like, okay, I
00:31:43 can kind of see it. So I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.
00:31:48 It's just the white people. I guess what I think that like, people who have like, I think when
00:31:55 you have a racial, like when you are, when you are a minority race, you feel particularly like
00:32:04 there's nothing I could do about this. And I'm just being shamed for for who I am. But it's like,
00:32:10 when you don't have that, they still find a way, like whatever is, whatever there is about you
00:32:16 that is different or or weird, you will be bullied for, you know, and it's like the severity of the
00:32:22 bullying or like where it happens, where you can get away with what is different depending on who
00:32:27 you are. But that's always the case. It's like, you can always get away with being certain people
00:32:32 in certain places and not in other places. And, you know, maybe being white, there's the
00:32:40 like gives you far more places that you can feel secure. But that is also under the circumstance
00:32:45 that you are white and like normal, you know, you're like, yeah. And you'll definitely be
00:32:52 bullied. You're definitely liable to be bullied for any any difference that you have from what's
00:32:56 perceived as the normal status quo. That's definitely true. I will say that for me, like
00:33:01 I as a, you know, as somebody who as a child, you know, I was a signed male at birth, told people
00:33:11 said I looked like a girl. I didn't like the people said that about me. But I did not attempt to
00:33:16 change myself. I could have though. And in my mind, that was always like a choice I was making.
00:33:21 It's like, I could choose to fit into society. I just would be really depressed and I wouldn't
00:33:25 want to. So if I can get away with living being like, you know, weird looking, then I'll just
00:33:32 I'll just do it. And like, I'll put up with whatever the consequences are, even if that means
00:33:36 getting bullied or looked down on. And like, you know, I understand that that's not viable for
00:33:42 everybody. And I never I never put myself in dangerous situations or had to be put in dangerous
00:33:46 situations because of my parents taking good care of me, both being around, having a house,
00:33:54 I didn't have to leave, you know, not having to involve myself in anything dangerous in order
00:34:00 to survive, which is something that both of my parents had to do. Like, they both had to commit
00:34:05 crimes to survive when they were teenagers, you know, so like, I understand, like, I understand
00:34:13 both why people would do that. And also, like, like, I would never because I've been I've been in
00:34:20 a situation where I didn't have to. And I understand that life is just better when you don't have to
00:34:25 commit crimes, you know, that's true. Definitely. So like, you know, when when the when the only
00:34:33 when you just commit crimes for fun, it's like way better than when you when you got to do it.
00:34:38 Yeah, it's better when it's when it's an unforced error. So yeah, when you can choose the crimes
00:34:43 that you want to commit because you feel secure and committing them were morally righteous and
00:34:47 in doing so, not because like, if I don't commit this crime, I won't be able to eat tonight. And
00:34:52 I'm not sure how many nights I can live if I don't eat, you know, right? Yeah, which is what poor
00:34:58 people experience, especially teenagers, you know, yeah. And like, in in their minds, they will
00:35:05 convince themselves that it's like normal, because it's just like, that's all they know. It's like,
00:35:10 yeah, crimes. Yeah, well, well, that level of life, that level of like, because that's what
00:35:16 society is expecting them to just continue on. Like society's expectation is, okay, well, your
00:35:23 life may be shit. But if you work really hard and get good grades, because you are smart, then
00:35:29 you'll make it through. And it's like, okay, well, like, like, make it through to do what, you know,
00:35:35 like, what am I, what am I aiming for exactly here, you know, and that these people just kind of
00:35:39 fall by the wayside and society doesn't make it through to make it through to, you know,
00:35:44 take out a bunch of loans and go to college and do it again, and then take out a bunch more loans
00:35:49 and go to, you know, grad school and do it again or whatever, and take out a bunch more loans and
00:35:53 like, you know, get a mortgage on a house or whatever. So they're just constantly trying to
00:35:58 meme you. It's the whole, this world is run by ad agents and intelligence agents. And most of them,
00:36:09 most of the ones with the power are just doing it. They're just in it for the boy pussy.
00:36:16 Like, okay, that's not where I was expecting you to go with that. But okay, I've, okay,
00:36:22 through the realization that almost every billionaire has been implicated as a pedophile,
00:36:27 I've come to start to wonder when you say when you say implicated as a pedophile, what do you
00:36:31 mean by that? Like associated with Jeffrey Epstein having gone to his island,
00:36:38 implicated in child sex trafficking, or child pornography having, or just being, you know,
00:36:47 being basically FBI case files or people who are protected by the CIA. I have no doubt that
00:36:53 like lots of them are, you know, billionaire pedophiles. I mean, I don't know, like, like,
00:37:00 having been being associated with Epstein isn't, isn't like a strong enough link for me because
00:37:05 like Epstein was a well connected billionaire himself. He probably knew all kinds of guys.
00:37:10 And part of, part of what him and, and, and just laying Maxwell, we're trying to do is to make
00:37:17 themselves constantly photobombing everybody so that everybody's implicated with them, you know.
00:37:22 And I definitely think there's different levels. That's why, like, and I know this.
00:37:27 Did you see the thing about Gislein's Reddit account? Oh my god, that shit is fucking incredible.
00:37:34 That is the revolution of the century. Karma account on Reddit. And she was like,
00:37:40 The first account to ever reach a million karma. She was like,
00:37:43 she was like a moderator of view of world news, I think, like a big subreddit.
00:37:47 People are speculating that she may have actually owned Reddit for a brief period
00:37:51 that like she had actually bought it and like, and that she's like literally one of the most
00:37:56 influential Reddit users of all time. And I completely believe it. But okay, you have to
00:38:02 think about it this way, because this is, this is all plays into why I was thinking about this,
00:38:06 because like, why would you feel the need to become a billionaire? Like, for me personally,
00:38:16 that's a great question. I love this question. Like, let's see where it leads us.
00:38:21 I mean, Ben, you, you are probably the person I know who is the most satisfied with the lowest
00:38:27 quality of life. And I mean that as a compliment, because I honestly do admire that about you,
00:38:32 because I'm so I, I'm somebody who like, when I picture like, what is the ideal way to live?
00:38:38 I think of like being just like a mountain man in a cabin, like growing my own shit off the land,
00:38:45 letting the insects have my crops and shit, you know, like not using no pesticides, nothing
00:38:50 in natural Henry David Thoreau thing with the rats eating your potato or the moles eating
00:38:55 your potatoes. I don't know that reference, but it's probably the same thing as the Arjuna episode
00:38:59 that I am referencing. So like, you know, who just joined this call? Gibbo just jumped in.
00:39:05 Hey, are you recording? Yes. Okay, we're fucking going to town. So I was just explaining to Ben
00:39:13 that like, what I consider to be the like, that my picture of like an ideal way of life,
00:39:18 like morally is like being, you know, like a mountain morally like, like, like morally and
00:39:24 also like, I think this would be, I think this would be like the most peaceful way to live your
00:39:30 life to like live in tune with nature out in the mountains, like growing enough crops to just take
00:39:36 care of however many people there are around, you know, fostering a healthy relationship with the
00:39:43 planet as you just live your life casually without really concerning yourself too much with like
00:39:50 advancing, you know, things like culturally or whatever. That's really hard though. It is,
00:39:59 it is difficult and you have to basically decide that that's going to be your whole life, you know,
00:40:03 is like, is homesteading. And I think that the purpose of society is that we don't need everybody
00:40:10 to do that. A few people can do it enough to provide for everybody. But I think that we have,
00:40:17 I think that we are, we build our societies too big that like ideally there would be more people
00:40:22 doing the agriculture for the benefit of, you know, making each community like more
00:40:29 agriculturally stable, less reliant on factory farming and all the other bullshit and factory,
00:40:34 everything factory education, more locally sourced. Yeah, like I decentralized, decentralized.
00:40:42 Yes, more decentralized because like when we think about like the ideals of like communism and like
00:40:48 what it should implement in the population is that like more people want to work for the government
00:40:54 because of the fact that there is no higher station really. Like the greatest purpose you can
00:41:00 have is towards the betterment of the community. But like communism only really, in my mind,
00:41:07 like makes sense on a community scale, like within one isolated community that has its own rules.
00:41:13 And like the, I think that there's a good reason to have like, I have a counterpoint to that.
00:41:18 Counterpoint. Part of the reason that and econ will, you know, make fun of me because
00:41:25 I'm so predictable for saying this demonstrably true thing. The part of the reason why communism
00:41:31 has never succeeded, has never really been implemented is because you can't really have it
00:41:36 in on a local level or even on a national level. You can't really have real communism,
00:41:42 a classless moneyless, stateless society in a world where you have to engage in trade
00:41:48 with other nations who do have class and money. So basically, I mean,
00:41:53 communism can only really work in like a completely isolated society or on an entirely
00:41:58 global scale. Okay, so by that definition, is there any meaningful difference between
00:42:02 communism and anarchy? Um, well, because it sounds like you're describing my ideal anarchy
00:42:12 by that. I mean, I guess, I guess the ideal anarchist society is also a classless moneyless,
00:42:18 stateless society. So I guess they are similar. I guess I don't know exactly what the distinction
00:42:24 would be. I mean, I think to me, the main reason that I run away from the idea of communism and
00:42:29 prefer the idea of anarchy is just that like, with communism, it's always going to come down to
00:42:35 someone's making the rules and about like, what is ideal? And like,
00:42:43 I don't know who, I don't know how people would become a part of the decision making process
00:42:49 of what are those ideals without like, democratic process of some kind, you know?
00:42:54 Yeah, well, yes. I mean, part of like, part of the idea, and I don't know exactly,
00:43:00 I'm not sure if this is like a Marx thing, or if this is like a later thing. But like,
00:43:04 part of the idea is that you, you move towards a society in which you abolish, well,
00:43:12 basically, you democratize everything. And the idea is that like, the more you democratize
00:43:17 everything, not just government, but like, you know, the workplace and stuff like that and like
00:43:22 community life. And the more you democratize everything, like the details kind of take
00:43:28 care of themselves. I was reading, I think it was in capital, but I was reading somewhere,
00:43:34 where no, it might have been a video, I don't remember. But the idea is like, if the more
00:43:39 things become democratized, like we don't have to speculate on, well, what does civilization
00:43:44 look like under communism? How do we handle this or that or the other thing? The answer is, we don't
00:43:49 know. We will find out when we get to a point where things are fully democratized and people can
00:43:55 decide things for themselves communally. And then they decide, and it might vary from place to place,
00:43:59 right? Like one community might run things one way and another another way, right? I don't know.
00:44:05 I guess lately I've been on this vein of thinking that like, the point is not, okay,
00:44:09 how do we structure society? How do we just, how exactly do we redistribute everything?
00:44:14 The point is the democratization wherein we just make those decisions as we need to.
00:44:19 Ideally, society should be in a flow state where we can make decisions as quickly as possible.
00:44:26 And like, I think the biggest problem with the government is too much bureaucracy and like,
00:44:33 which is ultimately like the, you know, what makes me fall, I guess, libertarian,
00:44:38 because I want the government to be smaller. But it's not about, it's not even for me about the
00:44:42 power of the government's being smaller. It's about the government's power to be reactive,
00:44:48 to like change its mind, to, you know, like, think about like how hard it is for somebody to be
00:44:55 let out of prison who, who did not commit the crime, where like, we've reassessed the case,
00:45:01 we know that like, there's not proper evidence, but like, it takes 15 years for this person to
00:45:07 get released, you know, that's a product of like, over bloated bureaucracy. And there's,
00:45:13 there's a lot of things that get caught up in that. And it's like, we need both, we, it's like
00:45:19 both going in and out, I guess it's like, the government needs to be able to react quicker,
00:45:24 and then also to take it back quicker, you know, the, the, yeah, the idea of the bureaucracy,
00:45:30 there cuts both ways, because on the one hand, the situation you describe is bad. But on the
00:45:34 other hand, that situation also means that there are all these procedures that we have to go through
00:45:38 before someone gets the death penalty, right? Like that's the reason why giving someone the
00:45:43 death penalty is more expensive than just giving them life in prison. Because there's all this red
00:45:47 tape to go through. And it's because we don't want to do this by accident. We want to have these
00:45:51 procedures to make absolutely sure that we're not just doing this willy-nilly.
00:45:54 I personally think it's weird that we even have the death penalty. Like, I don't, I don't really
00:45:59 get the point of it, you know. Yeah, the, there is a great video, I think it's his newest video
00:46:04 by Sean, where he talks about the death penalty. And yeah, like the point of the death penalty
00:46:10 is basically just to make people, like, feel better? Like, not the victim. It's to make, like,
00:46:17 it's because people in society are mad. Like, the argument is that it's a deterrent. The evidence
00:46:22 isn't really there to suggest that it actually is a deterrent. The purpose is because, like, people
00:46:26 who are mad about crimes want punishment. And that's the point. So, like, yeah, I mean, at some
00:46:33 point I will finish Foucault's crime and punishment and form a full... Foucault. Wait, that's Dostoyevsky.
00:46:41 No, what's the name of the book I'm thinking of then? Not crime and punishment.
00:46:45 It's a similar title, though. The Foucault book. Slime and Punishment. About, about, um,
00:46:52 Uh, that's F-O-U-C-A-U-L-T-Y-O-U-R-F-C-R-F-C-K, uh, Foucault. Foucault.
00:47:03 It's the one about fucking the death penalty and why it's a good, and I haven't read it yet.
00:47:08 It's scary. I don't, I don't know. Well, actually, it's more about why... I haven't read any Foucault.
00:47:13 It's not even, actually, it's not about why the death penalty is good. It's about why public
00:47:16 execution is good and why the death penalty is bad, actually, because it's not as good as public
00:47:23 execution. Because it's not public enough? Discipline and punish, that is the name. It's not televised.
00:47:29 Hmm, I see. World's deadliest executions. Uh, that's a Simpsons, Simpsons reference.
00:47:37 Hey, you know what's real fucked up just thinking about this? Is that everything I own and have ever
00:47:45 owned was made by somebody I will never meet and have never met, like, everything, except for the
00:47:52 like, the small, like, little bits of, you know, things that people physically may and give to me.
00:47:58 Brownish shit that you have. That's a little thing, that's a little thing we like to call
00:48:02 alienation from the means of production, my friends. That's, you better, you're talking
00:48:09 straight marks right now. You're gonna get, you're gonna fucking radical.
00:48:12 No, I feel that too. Like, my ideal, my present ideal is like, I want to have basically just like
00:48:21 a town of people I think are cool, where everybody makes their own shit, and it's just a self-sustaining
00:48:29 economy of people making cool shit and supporting one another on the basis of making cool shit.
00:48:34 I was, I was watching this. I like that idea, but it reminds me of something. Like,
00:48:40 yesterday I found this channel called Tasting History, where a guy cooks recipes from like,
00:48:46 cookbooks from like, Victorian times or like medieval times or even like ancient Greek stuff.
00:48:52 Like, he made this fish sauce called Garum out of like, fermented fish paste. It's like, it's like,
00:48:58 he does like, historically accurate reenactments of food that people in the ancient world used
00:49:02 to eat. It's pretty interesting, but he, he, there's one video, I think he's making some like,
00:49:08 some old bread. I forget what the name of the bread is, but he is talking, he talks about
00:49:14 Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which I read in high school, but I don't remember it all.
00:49:17 And I guess in Chaucer, Chaucer I guess really hates millers. Like, he basically thinks that all
00:49:23 millers are like, greedy businessmen and like thieves and like, rapscallions and rogues and
00:49:29 like, thinks they should be put to death because like, repeat offenders, right? For like, people
00:49:34 that are like, like cutting their, cutting their flour with stuff that's not flour. He's good.
00:49:39 I guess, I guess like, in medieval times, in a time when you would have lived in a little village
00:49:44 where like, one person makes the bread and another person like, you know, forges your plow or whatever,
00:49:50 the millers, there was an idea that these people, you know, owned the means of production in the
00:49:55 sense that like, everyone's got to eat and they're the ones that are feeding everyone,
00:49:59 but they're greedy and like, they'll overcharge you for the bread. Like, they'll fill it full
00:50:04 of air. So you have to pay more. They'll put their thumb on the scale. So like, so they,
00:50:08 you think you're buying more than you really are. A golden thumb. The phrase was, he has a golden
00:50:13 thumb, which both implies wealth, but also it was like, the thumb is, the thumb is heavy. The thumb
00:50:17 is heavy on the scale. So it's, he's charging you for more than you're actually getting. Millers,
00:50:21 dude, fuck millers. I hate them. Maybe this is arrogant. Everything wrong with society.
00:50:26 Maybe this is arrogant of me to think, but I feel like throughout history, like the problem has
00:50:32 always just been that like, people can't really like, communicate well. Like, I think that like,
00:50:38 communication has never been very good. And that like, in the past, I think we really like,
00:50:46 underestimate how fucking confused everybody was about one another's intentions and like,
00:50:51 how difficult it probably was for people who were not, who didn't know each other and like,
00:50:56 literally everything that was going on with one another all the fucking time, because that's
00:50:59 how people like were. It's like, people in your community, you literally know everything about
00:51:03 them. You see them constantly. There is no lapse in your understanding. But like, people were so,
00:51:09 because of that, people are super tribal and like, people from other communities, like, even if it's
00:51:13 just the next neighborhood over, it's just like, I have no idea who this person is. And then like,
00:51:19 this guy's from Shelbyville. I don't trust him. Yeah. I don't know. And I think that's the street
00:51:23 who are they are. Well, that's the thing. I think that the creation of the nuclear family
00:51:28 created it so that every household became its own community, because we started just like,
00:51:34 the idea of the, the, the fifties idea of the family is like, you personally have to write
00:51:40 everything. You don't rely on anybody. You own everything in your house. You have your own copy
00:51:46 of everything that you could possibly need. And therefore, you're self-reliant. But like,
00:51:51 people think that they need to be self-reliant to be successful. And it's like, you don't,
00:51:56 you could literally share these things with other people and live. The nuclear family is like,
00:52:00 a more recent idea. Like, like, obviously, people have like, lived like, just them and their partner
00:52:07 and their kids. Like that obviously always happened. But that wasn't always seen as like, the ideal
00:52:12 or the modern standards. You know, people lived in like, big, like, like extended family dwellings
00:52:18 or whatever. Like that was, that's normal for a lot of human history. I think it's a result of
00:52:22 having a culture of excess and proposing that excess as necessity because of the fact by way
00:52:29 of sociopathy. Because it's like, in America, we're told to fear our neighbor. Do not associate with
00:52:35 other people. Other people are scary. You should stay away from them and have all your own things,
00:52:42 you know? And so you convince yourself that you need to own, like say, a microwave, right? Like,
00:52:48 how often in the day does one person use a microwave? And imagine if there was like, a
00:52:54 microwave somehow in like the middle of the street in your, in like a cul-de-sac, right? And
00:52:58 everybody shared the same microwave. Probably wouldn't really be that much competition over the
00:53:03 microwave. Like, you know, point being, you know, and think about how much money is spent on all
00:53:10 eight people in that cul-de-sac owning their own microwave. It's like, this is what the government
00:53:13 wants to be because that level of consumption causes you to spend all this money that literally,
00:53:20 you could just go to your neighbor, if you knew your neighbor, you could just go to their house
00:53:24 and use their microwave, you know? And this is something that kids understand because kids are
00:53:27 in a position where they, you know, they have no power and so parents will let them sort of,
00:53:33 you know, rely on them a little bit more or adults in general might do that, especially in
00:53:38 suburban places. But like, you know, that doesn't mean that those like that, like nothing changes
00:53:45 about that when they grow up other than that they become more afraid of other people and more, you
00:53:50 know, uh, insistent on self-reliance. I'm just realizing that that was like the cause of so much
00:53:56 social distance, like not to use that term. Like the idea that I could like live in a rented flat
00:54:05 with a bunch of other people and share like a bathroom is like, oh, gross. I don't want to
00:54:10 have to like talk to people. I don't want to say anything to people down the hall. I just
00:54:14 want to have my own house. I want to buy my own house so I don't even have to talk to people.
00:54:18 That's what I'm doing. That's what my big dream is to live alone completely. And it's much more
00:54:23 expensive. I don't know. It's just like, why? Because, uh, what's the, you're not saying this is
00:54:30 a good thing. I'm saying this is like how society is meant to be. You're saying that it's not a
00:54:36 good thing, but then like, okay, so like, so you don't want it, right? Because it sounds like it
00:54:41 sucks. I think it's, I think it's a difference of faith and it's a strange one. It's interesting.
00:54:46 I think that, uh, for me, at least it's like, I have very little faith that I'm going to share a
00:54:54 house with somebody and it won't suck. But there are certain people who like sharing a house with
00:55:01 you was not a problem for me because you are pretty much completely on your own anyways.
00:55:06 Like you don't have a lot of space. Yeah. Uh, and, and you pretty much keep to yourself anyways.
00:55:12 You, you're not very like demanding of attention or anything. You, you, you don't cost much money.
00:55:18 You don't like, you don't use a lot of, you don't use very much electricity. You don't use very
00:55:23 much water. You don't use very much food, you know? Uh, so, and you eat my leftovers. So like,
00:55:29 if anything, you're helpful. Uh, that's like, that's, that's such a win with a real symbiotic
00:55:34 relationship. Everybody fucking gets what they need. Beautiful. You are very, let's me eat their
00:55:39 leftovers now when throws their leftovers away. I hate it. And Tom is very similar to you. You
00:55:43 know, having him as a house guest, never really a problem. The only concern could be like privacy,
00:55:47 just not being able to like walk around my house naked comfortably, you know? Right. Right. Which
00:55:52 never stopped you anyways. Well, but it doesn't to this day. Yeah. But like, I, I, so, you know,
00:56:01 to me, it's like, there's, there are certain people who I'm willing to share a house with.
00:56:05 Uh, I don't imagine there being that many people who I could, but I think it's the fact that I even
00:56:11 have faith that I could have a super comfortable home environment where it's like just me and the
00:56:16 closest people and we could be as open as we want is like a romantic idea to me. And I think that
00:56:22 you, Ben, are just somebody who like on some level just doesn't really believe that that's
00:56:27 necessarily true or even need it. Or maybe you just feel so comfortable that you just don't even
00:56:32 care. And like, sorry, it's easy for you that I don't believe what's true that you could have
00:56:38 a situation where you would be 100% comfortable at all times with another person.
00:56:46 Um, no, no, no, no, like the lack of beer. You're correct. It's kind of like in a strange way.
00:56:58 The, the, the idea that your thought in your head of like, okay, well, I will never have a 100%
00:57:05 uh, like comfort zone. So I might as well just have whatever comfort zone, like I don't,
00:57:13 I'm I'm actually really confused what you're saying. Okay, what the point you're making about me or about society or
00:57:22 What I'm trying to say is that
00:57:25 for me, it's like
00:57:28 If I were to live in a house, let's say like okay, I lived with you in DeVoo, right?
00:57:32 And living with you in DeVoo was fine and and shade and shade shade and amber
00:57:38 Yeah, they were forget they were around because we saw so little they were never there. Yeah
00:57:42 That situation was fine because like you're all people who I am comfortable around
00:57:48 I'm comfortable sharing a house with you, right?
00:57:50 But like obviously I wouldn't do everything that I would do in my own room in the middle of the house, right?
00:57:56 Like how many times yeah, how many times that I come to your room and you're like wait a minute
00:58:01 I'm naked. I have to put on clothes, you know usually right so like there's a certain level of you have a comfort zone of your room
00:58:09 But like you step out of that to go into the house and like for me
00:58:14 It's like I like having a house where the whole house is all my comfort zone and
00:58:20 The only way that can be possible is if the only people sharing the house with me are people
00:58:25 I'm completely comfortable with you know, but if if I didn't feel that there was anybody
00:58:30 I could be completely comfortable with then I would probably just be like, okay
00:58:35 Well, I'm fine with just having people I'm somewhat comfortable with and having my own room as a comfort zone
00:58:39 It's not like a terrible way to live and I think it's how most people live
00:58:42 I don't think there's many people who can find somebody who's like it's just gonna do like literally be down for absolutely every
00:58:50 Tendency they ever I don't you know, like I've had I've had like obnoxious living situations before
00:58:56 Right, I didn't like the people that I lived with and I wanted to avoid them and I felt anxious about seeing them
00:59:01 I don't feel that way here like sometimes there will be times when like I don't really feel like socializing
00:59:06 But like I'll have to go and like to the kitchen to get something and I'll have to walk through the living room
00:59:11 People are in there and oh god. Oh, they're gonna say hi to me and like whatever. That's fine. That's like not a problem
00:59:16 It doesn't it doesn't bug me. So I don't have any problems. That bugs me
00:59:20 That I definitely had that big time in the past. There was like particularly family members. There was a moment
00:59:27 Multiple I never feel like anything is demanded. Let's give it finish first. Okay multiple moments
00:59:32 When I was at uni when I was like in a shared house with six other people in their own rooms and stuff
00:59:40 We're like I needed I was hungry. I was at the computer in my room safe safe
00:59:45 No one can get me in here safe. Oh, no, I can hear people in the kitchen. I am hungry. I need to eat but
00:59:54 You know what? I think I'll just starve
00:59:55 I'd rather just like be hungry wait until they're gone to bed and then I'll eat and I happened a couple times
01:00:00 And I was like I know I mean I know but I did it. I know the feeling. No, I know the feeling
01:00:05 I used to I used to I'm a little less like that now
01:00:08 I did sometimes I still feel like there's people around like I don't just I'll just wait
01:00:13 I mean back. I guess that's true. I'm back in my hikikomori phase in particular. I'm I'm really stealthy
01:00:19 I'm very good at not being detected and like it was especially
01:00:25 Under the like waist-high walls
01:00:27 Yeah, I mean like particularly in in big houses
01:00:31 It's it's fun because there's a lot of different ways around and you could just quietly sneak up on people and like
01:00:37 You know, I'm big on both like surprising people by just like when they turn around. I'm suddenly there and also like
01:00:45 You know, just just but also just concealing my presence when it's like, okay
01:00:49 Like you said if like I want to get something
01:00:52 Downstairs, but like I hear somebody's down there
01:00:54 I will not go down until like I hear the sound has cleared and like, you know
01:00:59 I might still suspect that they might be awake and if they hear me they might say oh
01:01:03 You're still awake and I'll go
01:01:06 Don't think about the fact that I'm awake
01:01:09 run away
01:01:11 So the fucking people around feel very much pressure here with the people I live with now
01:01:17 I don't I'm not worried that they're gonna say anything. I don't I don't care what they think
01:01:21 I'm just like yeah, whatever and if I don't want to hang out. I'll just be like okay. Bye. I
01:01:27 Fucking hate the moments when when somebody is like, oh, you scared me. I didn't hear you
01:01:32 I didn't I didn't sense your presence. It was like I don't make I don't make a lot of noise
01:01:36 I guess I don't breathe heavily or stomp heavily and then they turn around
01:01:40 I'm trying to be stealthy and I feel like
01:01:43 Like a fucking serial killer. It makes me feel everybody says that I'm I'm very stomp
01:01:47 I'm like stomp apparently I'm very heavy footfalls
01:01:50 But like also I'm very easily snuck up on and like sometimes it happens all the time that I'll be cooking many times
01:01:57 Yeah, it's happened with a bunch of people here
01:01:59 Like I'll be cooking or something and I'll just turn around and someone will be in the kitchen
01:02:04 They came in when I went and I'm like, oh god. You are so easily frightened that I
01:02:09 I got to a point where I started expecting it
01:02:13 Like I tried to I would try like my approach you in a way that would like minimize the level of stress that it was going to
01:02:21 Yeah, like like people now like like my friend
01:02:24 Doob will like he'll he'll like kind of like step stomp a little loudly out the kitchen just to make sure he'll like knock on
01:02:30 The wall or something before he rounds the corners, so I'm not like
01:02:34 Yeah, I mean I might call out ahead of time just like hey Ben before I even into the room just so you know
01:02:39 These coming it's just I was just I would I was thinking of stuff like that
01:02:45 Like sometimes I try to make sure that my steps are pronounced, but not to pronounce
01:02:49 I don't want them to think I'm trying to get their attention because then they'll be saying huh, and then I'll be like
01:02:55 Why are you stomping bro? I hate I hate it when people are like why are you still walking?
01:02:59 Why are you doing anything and I and I'm literally just like hey, I'm a I'm walking here and like that's it
01:03:05 That's the answer
01:03:07 Can't fucking don't fucking question people hate hate hate being questioned. I hate when my methods are questioned
01:03:14 That's it. Yeah, well, this is this is this is fucking generalized anxiety disorder the podcast
01:03:23 Yes, wait you guys talk I have to pee I'll be back in two seconds
01:03:27 30 seconds 30 seconds
01:03:30 This is a story about a guy named Al who lives in a sewer with this hamster
01:03:34 Pal and I don't know any of the other words of the song because I never memorized it. It's really hard
01:03:39 Now you should have said long as I rhymed
01:03:41 Yeah, I thought about it, but I was like that doesn't make any sense so that I swerved
01:03:47 Crash maybe maybe maybe making sense was overrated in that context
01:03:51 Maybe rhyming would have been more aesthetically pleasing. You know, I was thinking about anxiety. I feel
01:03:58 like I used to
01:04:00 Like dismiss the idea that I had anxiety even though I was like socially awkward and a bit shy
01:04:05 The idea of like people who had anxiety they always talked about panic attacks and and like serious like
01:04:13 Immobilization things that they just could not do stuff and I was like, well, I guess if I push myself
01:04:18 I can do most things so I don't have that
01:04:20 Then I sort of internalize that as like every time I do feel a bit scared. There's no there's no excuse
01:04:26 I have I don't have anxiety. I have to do it. There's no way you know that I could be like
01:04:32 Some like mental blockage that here. I'm just like stupid or bad or something
01:04:36 I I think this is what we what you what you're describing is what you and I and and I think a lot of our audience
01:04:43 Have in common with with our anxiety is that like
01:04:47 It's it's like well, I'm I am sane and like I am smart enough to keep a handle on this
01:04:53 Like I don't have I don't have panic attacks all the fucking time because I understand that I am like what's wrong with me
01:05:02 so like
01:05:03 You know to some degree. It's like I understand that I'm panicking like I know that's what's happening and like I mean
01:05:09 I have had panic attacks
01:05:12 I am prone to them, but I I don't know they're not too scary for me because it's kind of like I understand
01:05:19 What's going on? I know why I'm panicking, you know
01:05:21 If anything the fact that I'm having a panic attack is kind of a relief and that it's like, okay
01:05:27 I get it. I get I get what's happening. This is just anxiety buildup, you know, and I think that that's I think that's something that a lot of us
01:05:36 Struggle with is literally like being like well, I feel the exact same way as a crazy person
01:05:44 However, I'm not crazy. So what do I do with that? You know like
01:05:48 Like I'm not demonstrably crazy
01:05:51 It's sort of a case of like, you know, the what's what's the phrase that basically mean like, you know
01:05:56 The the bigger wound gets the band-aid like what am I is there a idiom that means that agree the gray the squeaky wheel
01:06:05 Yes, thank you. Holy shit
01:06:09 Create a new idiom to try to remember that
01:06:12 The bigger
01:06:17 Squeaky wheel gets the grease so it's like, you know, yes, the people who are having uncontrollable panic attacks are the ones who are going to
01:06:27 You know, I mean who are gonna feel like they need to seek
01:06:30 help from somebody and
01:06:32 And get that dealt with and then the people of us who are like, okay
01:06:35 Well, I don't quite have uncontrollable panic attacks
01:06:38 But I feel everything just short of that and I still could use help
01:06:42 But I don't like need help so badly that I am a squeaky wheel, you know
01:06:47 So it's like I'm just a fucking half flat like I'm a halfway deflated wheel
01:06:53 I am I have poor traction on the road and I am a hazard, but I am not
01:06:58 Obvious enough for you to fucking get my air pumped up, you know, which is which is what I drive on basically is four of those
01:07:06 I mean a lot of
01:07:08 Like
01:07:09 Therapy or whatever is about or I don't know. I'm a fucking idiot and I don't know I'm talking about sorry if this is stupid
01:07:16 I'll go say it anyway. I think a lot like a lot of therapy and and psycho shit
01:07:21 Is about
01:07:23 Like just it's just about managing symptoms. Yes, like it's just and it like if your symptoms are managed
01:07:29 And if you feel that you are living more or less successfully without like great interruption from your issue
01:07:35 Whether you reckon whether you have issues or not if they're not fucking you up then that's okay
01:07:40 That is something that okay
01:07:41 I think this is a problem in basically advertising for psychology is that like
01:07:46 They they want to give everything a diagnosis so that everything is like clearly like we know what we're working towards
01:07:52 We have names for things and we can help these people out, but like by viewing everything that way
01:08:00 It's like like psychology is almost like an advertisement of like hey is your life really fucked
01:08:05 then you should come seek help here and it's like
01:08:09 Psychology and and therapy shouldn't be just for people whose life is uncontrollably fucked
01:08:15 It should be for anybody who's dissatisfied at all like you can iron out the dissatisfaction
01:08:21 You know like therapy and therapy doesn't have to be literally paying a
01:08:26 Psychologist to do it for you can just be talking to people because that's all it is you talk to a person who has more perspective than you
01:08:32 Do about how the mind works you you have plenty of friends who can probably give you
01:08:37 Something akin to a therapy session, you know if you have friends and if not make friends
01:08:42 It's it's it's good therapy, you know to talk to people who who could understand you but like
01:08:48 That's essentially all therapy is and if you understand
01:08:52 Psychology yourself you don't really need to talk to a therapist. You could just talk to other people who understand psychology
01:08:59 You know I have been
01:09:02 Because yeah, I've been thinking about that like for years like I don't really need to pay for things when I could have like people to talk
01:09:08 to but
01:09:09 It is a bad idea
01:09:11 Generally, I found to go to the public and to say on Twitter or in a YouTube video
01:09:17 Yeah, it's helpful somewhat because it's like a it's a different medium
01:09:20 But like I've got counseling like recently for the first time ever I've paid for a fucking bunch of stuff and
01:09:28 yeah, and I've had a few sessions now and
01:09:31 The the appeal is not that they know more than the people
01:09:37 Who could reply on Twitter or anything? I mean they do know more, but it's not that's not like the thing
01:09:43 I'm paying all this money for it's
01:09:45 the the the knowledge and
01:09:47 The the security that I can say all of this stuff and they are not ever
01:09:55 Going to cause they're not ever gonna cause Twitter drama. They're not ever gonna cancel me with this information
01:10:00 This information stays here
01:10:02 They are not like I am not at risk of making like ruining their day because it's their job to listen to me
01:10:08 I don't have to worry about like
01:10:11 Bringing the moods down or like doing anything to like a friend that would you know like make their day bad or you know
01:10:18 Whatever the the anxiety is like it's all just just speak and it's it's better than speaking to a brick wall or to a microphone
01:10:26 And then deleting the recording because it's a person and they can respond
01:10:29 Yeah, so it's like that is the value. I think the trust element is definitely is definitely when I when I see someone
01:10:37 Go on Twitter with like a problem, right and be like guys
01:10:43 I'm having a problem. This is really bothering me. Let me bear my soul. I'm
01:10:49 My reaction is not good. My reaction is is like, oh
01:10:54 if you're
01:10:55 This is not the place for that you're doing that you're doing it wrong
01:10:59 You're doing it wrong. I get I get why no no I get why they would do it
01:11:03 But I don't think they should and I think they should know better and I'm like
01:11:08 Don't please don't do this. I think it's it's sort of
01:11:12 It's sort of a matter of like these people don't know who
01:11:16 They can talk to and sure I would I would highly I totally sympathize for why I totally sympathize why they're doing
01:11:23 I just don't think it's going to do what they want it to do. I guess I guess I would say because like
01:11:27 those people
01:11:29 I completely agree with you like don't post in that kind of shit like on twitter is usually not
01:11:34 Very helpful, but it can attract people to your dms who might be able to help you
01:11:40 But maybe more effective than that is just going to people's dms like because people come
01:11:44 I opened up my dms after coming out. I have become a literal fucking guidance counselor for the entire
01:11:51 Trans anime community. So like you know, I I talk to people all the time about their issues and stuff
01:11:59 but
01:12:00 like
01:12:01 You know
01:12:02 It's easier if you're like coming to me
01:12:05 like
01:12:06 Hey, do you have a comment on this situation? And it's like, okay, like I know
01:12:13 I I know why you are coming to me
01:12:16 You know and like if I have a response, I'll give it to you if I don't I won't um
01:12:20 That's just it's as simple as that I give responses when I have thoughts
01:12:24 I read when I have time, you know, uh, if I'm interested if I'm bored
01:12:29 So it's not like I respond to absolutely everybody or anything like that. Um, just you know the level of engagement
01:12:34 I feel appropriate, but like, uh, you know, I do think that for a lot of those people
01:12:41 It's like they can't afford therapy
01:12:43 They don't they don't a lot of them just haven't yet accepted that they have a problem or like don't really they
01:12:49 Again, they think oh, I'm not that extreme like oh, I don't have panic attacks or oh
01:12:54 I don't have like extreme body dysmorphia and it's like, okay
01:12:57 Well, do you find that you live most of your life in a in a sort of dissociated haze or you're not really paying attention
01:13:04 Anything going on around you and it's like, oh, yeah, that's how I live every moment of my life
01:13:07 And it's like, okay seek therapy, you know, like that's not it's not supposed to be that way
01:13:11 It's like, yeah, uh, you know, you definitely
01:13:14 But it's all I've ever known
01:13:17 Say I'm so comfortable here
01:13:19 um
01:13:20 It's nice and gray
01:13:23 Imagine imagine living in an associative haze cringe
01:13:31 Associative haze boys
01:13:34 This hashtag
01:13:38 Um, Ben, you you're you're a lincoln park fan. Yeah
01:13:43 Yes
01:13:44 Yes, yes, that's right. So I've been thinking a lot about lincoln park and about chester bennington lately because of him killing himself and
01:13:52 Right, I don't know if you know much about his past
01:13:55 But like no, it's nothing nothing at all. Uh, well, uh, it's horrible. So I'll say it in a funny way, uh, but he uh was
01:14:05 Sexually abused for like, uh years by
01:14:10 By like an older friend and he was afraid to say anything about it
01:14:13 You hate to see it. Yeah, he was afraid to say anything because he thought that they would think he was gay
01:14:18 and uh
01:14:19 Like it's it's it's really interesting because like that would really suck to imagine being gay
01:14:25 She's exactly
01:14:31 Uh, so he uh
01:14:33 he uh
01:14:35 You know, when you when you listen to lincoln park's music knowing this and knowing like
01:14:40 He was also he basically became an alcoholic
01:14:43 Uh
01:14:44 And like in early lincoln park
01:14:46 He was an alcoholic and a lot of the song like crawling is about alcoholism that like he said so as much as like
01:14:52 It's about my an inability to escape my alcoholism
01:14:55 And when you look into the lyrics knowing why he was an alcoholic and he's talking about these wounds that will not heal
01:15:02 Uh and how fear is how I fall. It's like, okay. Well, this is what the song's about, you know, I see it to be fair
01:15:07 You can read almost anything you want into the lyrics of lincoln park song
01:15:12 Uh, but that's that's it's it was fascinating to me to because I've always felt that way
01:15:17 It's like oh anybody can project onto this
01:15:18 But once I actually knew what he is like what it's actually like what he actually went through personally
01:15:25 And I mean particularly with some of the later songs because
01:15:28 He you know, aside from the fact that he went through alcoholism
01:15:32 He later on uh, he because he became a recovered alcoholic
01:15:35 And there's a bunch of songs that are about like alcoholic recovery about
01:15:40 Recovering from your past traumas. They have one song on one of the songs. It's called like victimized. That's just like, you know
01:15:45 You've been victimized or whatever and uh, so like, you know
01:15:50 I think that he was he was dealing with these demons trying to move through them
01:15:55 And like holding himself to a really high standard
01:15:58 And it seems as though basically what happened is that when chris cornell the singer of uh, um
01:16:05 Soundgarden killed himself who was like one of chesters like best friends and personal idols
01:16:09 He like couldn't take it and not too long later
01:16:13 He lapsed
01:16:15 Drank some alcohol couldn't take the idea that he would become an alcoholic again and killed himself. So
01:16:20 Wait, who was it that died that made him relapse the the soundgarden lead singer, you know black hole sun
01:16:27 chris cornell, I don't know is okay
01:16:29 Cool. Um, so he had committed suicide not too long beforehand and then chester seemingly like fell as well
01:16:36 But anyways, it's it's fascinating to me because of the fact that
01:16:41 Um before he was in linkin park. I had not known this. He was a part of a band called gray days
01:16:46 just
01:16:48 Gray and then days da ze
01:16:50 Um, and I they they they like reproduced their first album
01:16:56 Before chester died. So like this was going to come out
01:16:59 Then he killed himself and it now is out like they finally released it the songs have been on the radio
01:17:05 And it was really funny because I saw that the when I first heard the song
01:17:09 I saw it said gray days and I thought oh, there's a band
01:17:13 That's called gray days. That's funny because mine. I've called myself gray
01:17:17 In reference to the fact that I spend my time in a gray days. This is perfect, right?
01:17:22 And I'm listening to it and I'm listening to the music and I'm like this sounds just like linkin park
01:17:26 Which is really funny because I grew up listening to linkin park and thinking, you know
01:17:30 Like connecting to those emotions not even realizing it was chester and his old band until I looked it up
01:17:35 And then I'm like, okay, this all makes sense
01:17:38 Um, but like the songs
01:17:41 The album is like I won't say it's great. You might enjoy it. Um
01:17:46 It's pretty all right like radio rock type music pretty much very like washed out and daisy
01:17:52 But like the lyrics from the perspective of knowing that he killed himself the lyrics are too fucking depressing like
01:18:01 The the second track the second track is like
01:18:04 Maybe maybe things will get better
01:18:07 Maybe things will get brighter
01:18:09 Maybe maybe
01:18:12 And it's like oh no
01:18:16 And they did it they clearly did it. No, I guess I guess not. Well, maybe next time
01:18:23 But it's just funny because like that music
01:18:26 Again, like linkin park like you said the emotions are painted with such a broad brush
01:18:30 They don't seem to be about anything in particular and like listening to gray days, which is
01:18:35 They're even earlier, you know writings in linkin park like this is must be how he felt when he was a teenager
01:18:41 Maybe resurfacing these emotions gray days was from before linkin park. Yeah, that was the band
01:18:45 He was in for like six years before
01:18:47 Linkin park and they were like they broke up because they just like it wasn't going anywhere and then he joined
01:18:53 Linkin park and became huge so like
01:18:55 You know, I think he was basically trying to like readdress
01:18:59 these past emotions
01:19:01 And so he was thinking about them a lot
01:19:03 And then, you know, chris cornell killed himself and he's like well if chris couldn't make it
01:19:07 I can't fucking make it, you know
01:19:09 Because he tweeted something like after chris cornell died like I can't imagine like living in this world without you or something like that
01:19:16 um
01:19:17 Yeah
01:19:19 I mean if you ask me he might have been gay for chris cornell
01:19:23 And that was what was you know, what was no he was gay after all
01:19:28 I mean
01:19:31 That's just my personal theory, but like
01:19:33 uh, okay
01:19:35 You know, but like it's just like man the fucking the lyrics their lyrics that like again
01:19:41 If you heard this on the radio, you would just be like, oh, this is like cheesy fucking radio music
01:19:46 It's just so general it could be anything but it's like this motherfucker actually killed himself
01:19:51 And we know what he went through. We know he was an out of recovered alcoholic
01:19:55 We know he killed himself because he relapsed
01:19:57 We know that he was an alcoholic because he was trying to deal with these childhood demons
01:20:00 And he wouldn't talk about it
01:20:02 Like his wife became like a big advocate all the stuff surrounding him after his death that like all the money
01:20:08 Surrounding him is going towards uh, like basically boosting mental health
01:20:13 Normalization of like talking about it because like obviously he was somebody who the reason that the lyrics of lincoln park are so reserved
01:20:20 Is he didn't want to talk about it?
01:20:22 You know like he didn't want to be specific because it was too fucking hard to deal with so
01:20:26 Uh, you know which ironically makes it connect to the most possible people
01:20:31 But it means that he was the most guarded person
01:20:33 You know like the person least capable of actually confronting the reality of what had happened to him
01:20:40 Uh, so like and you know in his attempt
01:20:45 Ultimately fell. It's just depressing
01:20:48 Sorry to bring down the room
01:20:52 But I thought you'd appreciate that as a lincoln park fame
01:20:54 I do that's neat. No, I didn't know I knew chester killed himself. I didn't know shit about him other than that
01:21:00 Yeah, I hadn't been told recently either, but
01:21:04 Um
01:21:05 Well, hey we're at
01:21:07 We're at an hour and 20 and we've got like a million voicemails to get through but let's like try and rapid fire them
01:21:14 Yeah, but you still are you still here? I'm still here
01:21:17 You we're on we're on speak pipe if you want to oh the first one we're gonna do is
01:21:22 Yes, yes, I know. Yeah, there's like 30 fucking voicemails in here
01:21:26 I'm gonna try and just like we're gonna go fucking bup bup bup bup bup through all this shit because I'm
01:21:33 You know
01:21:34 Nate was like, uh, hey, I'll fucking curate these for a fee
01:21:40 Um, and I'm like no man anarchy
01:21:43 curation it's for the birds
01:21:46 Everybody everybody gets a platform here on the pro krastinators podcast
01:21:52 All right, call it and say some nazi shit. I don't give a fuck
01:21:57 Uh, okay, I'm there
01:21:59 Okay, here we go with ben playing d&d
01:22:02 three two one
01:22:05 go
01:22:10 Yeah, cool. All right. Good. Good stuff. They
01:22:15 True, it's like
01:22:17 You know that meme that's like what's your sign? I'm a leo. Fuck you. I don't believe in that made-up horseshit
01:22:22 And then he's like so true to the periodic table. I was excited by how short that one was but
01:22:28 Unfortunately, it's a rare breed amongst these in that regard
01:22:33 We don't have to listen to all of them if they're boring. Let's see how cognate cognate cognate potus potus potus is
01:22:40 Christ, okay. Here we go. Three two, but no, but I'm saying that's me. That's me going so true looking at this song
01:22:49 Ribbit ribbit ribbit. I'm a goddamn frog. Haven't played d&d in like two weeks now. Kind of kind of disappointed, but okay, whatever
01:22:55 Uh cognate potus three two one go
01:22:59 yo
01:23:01 cognate
01:23:04 I think this is gonna be boring running for president
01:23:08 Everyone is saying that it's like a trick by trump to get people uh to vote cognate. So then that like the everyone that is
01:23:16 All right, let's go to the next one
01:23:18 My my thoughts on this ever everyone says like oh no if people vote cognate
01:23:22 Then it'll split the vote and trump will win like I think a lot of people who would have voted for trump would vote for cognate
01:23:28 I don't see I don't see this as like a thing that's gonna exclusively like cut into the democrats at all
01:23:34 Uh, I I mean, I just straight up wouldn't have voted if not for cognate. I mean, I'm only going to vote if I can vote for cognate
01:23:41 Yeah, oh god, jesus. Oh, whatever fine. Yeah vote cognate. Yeah vote cognate. Fuck it
01:23:48 Fuck it. I'll do it live right you ready for super smash brothers pedo and g-note. I absolutely. I'm ready. Okay three two one go
01:23:57 It seems as if the super smash brothers plays are all pedophiles
01:24:02 They're all groping at children and kissing miners and then the dog is crazy
01:24:07 That's a narrow and zero and the catara are these super smash brothers. I don't know if we need 57 seconds of this
01:24:16 It's it's a terrible
01:24:19 Yeah, that's it. Okay, cool. Yeah for a second
01:24:24 Uh, yeah, it's it's another one. There's another super smash post ultimate pedo ultimate g-note
01:24:30 It's the same. It's almost the same length. Should we just listen to it? Let's do it. I guess so
01:24:35 Three two one go
01:24:38 Well, it's happened all of the fupus smash brothers play as a pedophiles
01:24:43 They have been confirmed as such
01:24:46 Fucking zero
01:24:49 This is a different voice. I guess he thought the first voice is still annoying. I don't I don't know if this is no better
01:24:55 If it's like a redo, I don't know if that's a remake or a sequel
01:24:59 Um
01:25:00 It seemed like he started off saying pretty much the same shit though
01:25:04 Oh, it was almost the second one. It's like well now it's all of them. So the oh the situation has progressed
01:25:09 Maybe not. Um, I was seeing people
01:25:12 I was seeing people on twitter saying like oh no
01:25:16 I saw someone say like god if my family finds out about this shit. It's all over
01:25:21 I won't be able to go to smash tournaments anymore. And at the time I didn't know the context but in hindsight i'm like
01:25:28 kind of hope
01:25:29 They don't have any smash tournaments for a while after this
01:25:32 Kind of hope they don't do it. They probably shouldn't be having smash tournaments in the middle of the uh, you know
01:25:37 COVID and all that yeah
01:25:39 I think it was vosh tweeted something about how like
01:25:42 Sky williams house is like the the epstein island of the smash community. Do you know about this?
01:25:48 Yeah, I I know nothing about any of this. I guess a lot of these smash tournaments were held at the home of this guy named
01:25:54 Sky williams and it's not it doesn't there's no explicit accusations that sky william who I think is a guy
01:26:00 I don't even know that sky is a is a pedophile himself
01:26:03 But like I guess it was like at this house that like a lot of this fucking
01:26:08 I don't know fucking diddling it happened
01:26:10 So it's like I don't know big deal
01:26:13 The dillyard. Yeah, the dillyard's room. Uh, let's let's watch the best reality tv show of all time. Absolutely

01:26:34 No, this is like the kind of reality show that gets canceled after the first season and it gets sued like a shit ton
01:26:41 times afterwards and years to come and then uh, the studio tried to hide its existence
01:26:46 But it still exists. It's on youtube and there's like a bunch of people talking about it
01:26:52 Get to the point. Yeah, what is it?

01:33:45 Hey guys, have you seen this video? I'm linking as the title of this voicemail by a dank wizard
01:33:53 It's fucking funny. We've seen it and it is pretty funny. All right. Good school
01:33:58 So, okay, so that that previous voicemail was somebody making fun of a dank wizard for being a uh
01:34:04 A dank pussy basically about a pussy a pussy wassy
01:34:12 You think that was the real dank wizard
01:34:14 No, I thought they were making fun of a dank wizard. I thought that was no
01:34:19 No, I think that's I think that's what his real voice sounds like
01:34:23 That's just how I think it's a controllable smooching
01:34:27 It feels like what he would be
01:34:30 I don't you know, it's funny. I'm not I'm not mad
01:34:32 I just think it's funny that someone made a video like that
01:34:35 And I have to share it on twitter because I just want to spread the love and good times around
01:34:41 I want everyone to enjoy it as much as I do
01:34:43 Uh, all right next one
01:34:46 Thirteen seconds. Thank you merciful shower speed run chads three two one go
01:34:52 Any fellow shower speed run shads still hanging around? I just got a
01:34:58 149 that's pretty damn fast. I'm not sure I can get it any lower
01:35:04 We'll see though. We we should have leaderboards
01:35:07 149 doesn't seem that fast for a shower. I mean, what are the requirements? Like what all do you have to do?
01:35:13 That yeah, like do I like if you have to use conditioner that it necessarily takes more than two minutes
01:35:19 If it doesn't require a conditioner if it's just shampoo and body soap if you just use like an all-in-one
01:35:24 It would take like what 30 seconds like
01:35:28 I feel like I could do a really bad job washing myself off in like 30 seconds. Yeah
01:35:33 Like just like jump in grab the soap rub it around rinse off jump out. You know like that's all it takes
01:35:39 It's technically a shower
01:35:41 Well, we need categories. We need categories, right? We need speed run categories
01:35:45 It's like, you know the category for like you with conditioner without conditioner shampoo. No shampoo, you know
01:35:52 Yeah, how rich is your lather? All right hippo. What were you trying to say?
01:35:55 I'm sorry. By the way, sorry. I still call you hippo because I realized everybody's calling you gib again
01:36:02 Since you don't really have an active hippocrite channel. I just got so used to saying you hippo
01:36:07 It has a good cadence to it. Uh
01:36:10 I don't mind. I feel like there's still no consensus
01:36:13 My my my preferred my preferred pronoun is gib. Is it okay? I was told that so I was like, okay
01:36:20 But like it it you know, it doesn't matter. It's like it's it's just like I prefer the word give
01:36:25 I've never actually been sure
01:36:29 Well, uh now, you know, I'm just saying
01:36:33 I've been getting into the long play shower game
01:36:36 Where I I I use the shower as my my chance to meditate and I I sit like crouch at the at the bottom of the shower
01:36:44 And I close my eyes and I go into a deep trance and I wake up
01:36:49 Um, and uh, it takes a very long time. So I made a new category long play
01:36:56 Uh, you we need it's it's it's good. Okay. We we can have a leaderboard
01:37:00 But the thing is we're gonna need like it needs to be verified
01:37:03 So you're gonna have to film yourself showering and send it to us
01:37:07 Uh, and we're gonna have to manually review each submission in order to verify that no, uh, you know that there were no cuts in the footage
01:37:14 Yes, and that you were playing all the pictures that you and that you were playing on approved hardware
01:37:20 Approved hardware only in that you must have tits
01:37:25 end of vagina
01:37:27 That's the hardware i'm talking about
01:37:29 Okay, okay
01:37:32 One piece more like one piss
01:37:35 I am ready as a matter of fact
01:37:37 three two one go
01:37:40 PCP more like ppc
01:37:46 In other words, yeah
01:37:52 It's like it's like the regular ocean this guy's like on crystal math

01:38:25 The drug war rages. We got to put him in jail and get his put him in voice. No voice grail
01:38:29 We didn't abolish it the funniest voicemail i've ever heard
01:38:32 Hmm
01:38:34 The line is like the year in ocean the line between greatness and and idiocy is so is so paper thin in a case like this
01:38:44 Genius or insanity. I am ready for an emotional journey because the next two are called margarh and margarh's apology
01:38:52 Margarh has been margarh has been sending voicemails like the last several weeks
01:38:58 So they've clearly got a lot to say so let's well, they're they're saying something and then apologizing. So that's what i'm the most curious about
01:39:06 Let's let's let's jump in there with them three two one go
01:39:12 Hello pcp
01:39:13 Yeah, I do always send the voicemails late on saturdays
01:39:19 And I guess that means that I usually end up being the final voicemail
01:39:23 Uh having been the final voicemail two weeks in a row
01:39:26 I'd like to issue a challenge to the community to uh beat me and be the final voicemail
01:39:32 Um, I haven't even been trying so
01:39:35 He succeeded massively on I mean a lot of people want this challenge because there's like 10 more of these
01:39:42 Things after this you're yeah, he's he's already won because like yeah
01:39:46 He normally sends he was the last one because he would always send it on like the day of or the day before
01:39:51 but this time we got like
01:39:53 We got like 10 voicemails in the last like 12 hour or in the last like 24 hours
01:39:58 So I don't know what's up with that
01:40:01 So next margar's apology. Let's find out what he's so sad about
01:40:05 three two one go
01:40:08 Hey margar here. I'd like to issue a formal apology to mr. Tom oliver
01:40:14 Uh recently one of my voicemails. I asked why there were so few members coming onto the podcast
01:40:21 And tom clarified that it's literally because of the fucking unemployment shit
01:40:26 That uh, it's just better for him to not show up as much. So
01:40:31 Uh pretty cringe, uh bad
01:40:34 Bad take on taxes from the government. Uh
01:40:38 No hate towards tom though. You got to do what you got to do. Uh, so sorry. I complained about that
01:40:45 But the complaint stands for all the others unless you justify it. So fuck you
01:40:50 I don't know what an apology was necessary for
01:40:56 I'm I'm fucking on unemployment too and I all and I just show up anyway. So, uh, you know, whatever
01:41:01 No, no, fuck tom. No fuck tom and fuck you too margar voice jail voice jail. Huh, huh?
01:41:07 I thought we abolished the voice no
01:41:09 We did not the the stream only raised enough to free
01:41:13 I think it was three out of the eight people in voice jail. So we did not fully abolish it
01:41:17 We did defund it though, which is something. Um, but we're still we have voice voice chair
01:41:25 Hmm
01:41:26 Voice chair, you know for the ones we really don't like oh like with a single bare light bulb hanging above them. Yeah
01:41:33 Yeah, see
01:41:36 This'll be easier if they tell us their voicemail secrets
01:41:40 Uh, next one
01:41:42 11 seconds message to ben part two
01:41:46 Mysterious three two one go
01:41:49 What did I tell you ben?
01:41:52 Get off twitter
01:41:54 Bad ben bad ben shoo shoo shoo go to your room. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Fuck
01:42:01 I hate the yes. I know twitter bad twitter bad, but we all do it. We're all guilty. I love trying so
01:42:08 I have no bad relationships with twitter
01:42:11 I you know, I just I was thinking about it
01:42:14 All like all you see all you see are the worst takes on twitter
01:42:18 But I don't know i'm with two minds about this because on the one hand
01:42:20 Yes, what I get on twitter is a concentrated stream of the worst things that happen and the worst things that people think and it makes me upset
01:42:28 So is that reality because on the one hand I genuinely believe that these are real things that people think
01:42:33 On the other hand, they're probably not as common as they seem
01:42:36 When you when you're getting them. Well, it's both that they're not as common and also that these people are not as likely like
01:42:42 Acting on these beliefs like like I think I think most people have like it's easier to talk shit on twitter
01:42:49 Yeah, well not just talk shit
01:42:50 But I think that people live in ways that are contrary to their beliefs without realizing it because it's easy to like
01:42:57 To to intellectually
01:42:59 Internalize a set of beliefs but to actually like perform in a way that would best
01:43:03 Cause like your like to best further your cause
01:43:07 Is really difficult for people on on any side like most of your life is dedicated to just trying to live your life
01:43:13 Not trying to further anything and like in many cases living your life is actively furthering causes that are against you
01:43:20 And you really can't help it. I mean like you've you've said many times
01:43:22 There's no ethical consumption under capitalism, you know like sure
01:43:26 So it's just and I am and I did invent that phrase as well
01:43:30 To make you to make people understand
01:43:32 Yes
01:43:34 Sorry twitter is
01:43:35 Yeah, go ahead
01:43:37 I was just gonna say twitter is like reductionist goggles
01:43:41 Like you put them on and you see the most reduced form of a person due to the character limit
01:43:47 And then through that you form opinions that are not necessarily correct in any way
01:43:52 All in the people that are speaking and then you get a sense that things are terrible
01:43:57 And I don't know whether it's it's actually that as as bad as it is
01:44:00 Uh, I mean there are genuinely there are genuinely terrible people
01:44:05 Let's let's acknowledge twitter amplifies it. Yeah. No, it's true. I mean I definitely I
01:44:11 Ben I think in many ways that you you are right in your approach to twitter because like people take it too seriously
01:44:19 Well, it's not like okay like
01:44:22 The way that you go about it is I was I was I was catching some flags
01:44:26 I was catching some flak the other day about my approach on twitter
01:44:30 Yeah, I would say the way you go about it is alienating and like there are definitely people who it's gonna make mad
01:44:35 But do I think it's necessarily ineffective?
01:44:38 Like I do think that you if you if you really have a problem with the things that people are saying
01:44:43 Aggressively letting them know that will cause them to reflect
01:44:48 They might just double down on hating you, but they will have to think about their beliefs that much is true
01:44:53 And I do like I I do not endorse bullying
01:44:56 But do I think bullying doesn't work or that it can't be a viable tactic? No
01:45:01 And so like ultimately I don't I don't see anything that I do is bullying. I am am I caustic sometimes?
01:45:08 Yes, do I say mean things? Yeah, but like would you say it's but it's bully
01:45:12 It's bullying if there's like an unfair an unfair power dynamic
01:45:15 I mean if I say bullying I feel like it's a cuter way of saying being abusive
01:45:19 Or or abrasive like what do you want me to say?
01:45:22 Those are not the same thing. Those are not those are two different things. They could be close
01:45:27 Am I abrasive? Yes. Am I abusive?
01:45:29 I don't think so unless like insulting someone is automatically abusive. I wouldn't say so
01:45:34 I think you're I don't think that you are uh
01:45:37 I I I wouldn't call you abusive. I do insult people like I definitely do that
01:45:44 Yeah, I saw some of the flak you were getting and some of the the responses would just sort of like
01:45:50 Uh, you're not gonna further any causes by the way you act right and you were getting really mad like do you think it's
01:45:58 Do you think it's like annoying that people expect you to be fighting for a cause with everything you say a little a little
01:46:05 Yeah, a little because I I always feel a little like like
01:46:09 if if I like
01:46:11 There's like a watch on your back like
01:46:14 If you're gonna be progressive you better be progressive in exactly the right way
01:46:18 Otherwise, we're gonna shit on you as well. It was it was I was getting a little annoyed because yeah the feeling I was getting was like
01:46:24 Ben
01:46:25 We we you you know we share these like we share these ideas. We share goals politically culturally whatever
01:46:33 And what I want is to see you pursuing those things optimally and the way you are comporting yourself
01:46:40 Is not optimized and I'm like you might be right. Well, I mean it's kind of also like no I'm not going to like
01:46:47 Who I'm not going to behave off literally who you know that can be optimal
01:46:52 Who can behave optimally all the time is in in any given situation
01:46:56 Would I maybe get better results from being like hey?
01:46:59 I see that you said this weird thing you said something about the jews that I don't agree with and I have some historical like
01:47:05 References that you might want to read that might disprove some of your hypotheses like let me go through them one by one and point
01:47:11 Maybe that would be more effective than saying like like like fuck off
01:47:14 Nazi right maybe that's more effective, but I'm not going to do that
01:47:18 I can't do that
01:47:19 What do I get the most bang for my buck from and you know this is in terms of both
01:47:23 Impact on the water broader world at large and also like how does it affect me?
01:47:27 How taxing and painful is it for me to go through exactly that's that's the part it's like being
01:47:33 Being polite is like it takes effort. It takes like if you are not I think there are people out there who just naturally are
01:47:41 Frankly, I have a low capacity for it. I really do
01:47:44 I mean there are people out there who have who really are good at being polite and understanding and
01:47:50 Like it's just the way they were raised
01:47:52 You know it's just they they came up with that and like for me
01:47:56 It's it's not that I don't want to be polite and understanding. It's just really hard, you know, and it's like
01:48:02 I I think
01:48:04 As long as I mean in my mind
01:48:06 It's like as long as I'm trying my best to not be like
01:48:08 Deliberately an asshole
01:48:10 Then I feel like I like I'm not going to overextend myself
01:48:14 To the to the like furthest extent I can to be the nicest I possibly can especially to people who are being mean to me
01:48:21 It's like if you are being mean to me
01:48:23 I am going to feel you know, like hey, you you really need to know
01:48:29 Like I guess it's it's kind of like if somebody was
01:48:33 Bumping into you constantly and you kept saying stop or like could you move away and they weren't doing anything
01:48:39 At some point you just have to fucking jam your elbow into them and just be like get the fuck away from me
01:48:43 You know, so it's like
01:48:45 If you if you want to live in this world you have to be somebody who can eventually just say like hey
01:48:51 Your existence threatens me and I'm going to do something about it, you know
01:48:55 My yeah my last argument on the way about the way I can port myself on twitter is there are now
01:49:01 I might be I will admit that maybe I am
01:49:04 inclined to
01:49:06 Take this approach maybe slightly more often than it is strictly necessary, right? I'll grant that but there are some
01:49:12 Things there are some ideas. There are some opinions. There are some things that people can say
01:49:17 That I believe are so
01:49:20 Are so despicable and so wrong that to that to try and like
01:49:25 Like
01:49:27 Respond to them thoughtfully and to to try and like answer them and rebut them
01:49:32 Is like doing them too much credit
01:49:34 I mean it's it's sort of like and and and a more way let me fit and a more appropriate response
01:49:38 And in some of those cases, I think a more appropriate response is not to even do so at all
01:49:43 But just to say like I have nothing but contempt for that. I will not answer this
01:49:47 I I will simply express my disgust and that's all that is required at the root because it's like
01:49:52 You could attack what they're saying, but like what they're saying
01:49:56 Like in order to express how wrong it is you would have to peel back so many layers of the wrongness
01:50:02 It's like this is this is not even from a perspective capable of expressing
01:50:07 Something correct because it is so wrong and so like at that level. It's like
01:50:13 My inclination would be more likely to just ignore it like even if I thought even if I did have like a visceral
01:50:19 Reaction of hatred towards something I read my reaction is like I don't want to get involved
01:50:23 I don't want drama. I don't want to I don't want to get to I don't want to get into an argument
01:50:27 But I do understand why like if you have that reaction and you say something like again
01:50:32 Even if in the short term it doesn't seem to have quote-unquote an effect
01:50:36 Like when you let people know that you have a problem with them
01:50:40 Then they are going to have to think about the fact that they're going to think about that fact and granted
01:50:45 I think that when you are super aggressive
01:50:48 It is more likely that the conclusion they'll come to is well. Fuck you even harder than sure like I don't think that
01:50:55 I don't think it's a bad thing to put it in people's head that people have a problem with them
01:51:00 You know like yeah, that's that is step one towards changing your behavior. You know to to us too
01:51:07 I think I think that just like putting up any
01:51:11 Yeah, I feel like the word resistance kind of aggrandizes just being a should be like being shitty being me and insulting someone online
01:51:19 But like putting up any kind of resistance at all to something that you think is bad and needs to change is like well
01:51:25 It's not it's not is it optimal who knows but I do think it's right to do that
01:51:29 And I don't ever feel but I almost never feel bad about it unless I decide like oh
01:51:34 I read this wrong or like I misinterpreted
01:51:36 Well, I mean worst-case scenario you change it back like I think I think one of the biggest problems facing our like generation
01:51:42 And the the one of the things caused by the anxiety we all feel is like we're so afraid of doing it wrong
01:51:49 Of like hurting somebody's feelings and then not knowing how to deal with it afterwards
01:51:53 And it's like the best way to deal with it is like if you were wrong admit it as fast as possible
01:51:58 And make things right, you know, just be like oh, I'm sorry. I was wrong like I've changed my mind
01:52:05 I understand that I that you that you were not saying what I thought you were saying
01:52:09 We're cool now, you know, like
01:52:11 It's just like adaptability is the way to navigate conversation, you know
01:52:17 Yeah
01:52:18 Although I'm usually not that interested in a conversation. I'm usually just interested in expressing an idea or a feeling and then like leaving
01:52:26 I mean, I think that you're I guess what I'm saying is that from the perspective of other people
01:52:31 Analyzing your actions. It's kind of like they look at it as oh, well
01:52:34 I wouldn't do this because I wouldn't want to face the social ramifications of this
01:52:39 um, so
01:52:40 like so ben you need to stop because like
01:52:44 They assume you wouldn't either. Yeah, I don't want to I don't want to face the social ramifications of this
01:52:50 So I should become the social ram right exactly
01:52:53 That is literally exactly a little dude people people fucking like that though and and we do it to ourselves too
01:52:59 We're like I don't want to be too mean to these guys because I know that like in a way
01:53:03 They have their hearts in the right place, but I whatever I do think it was dumb the whole the whole discussion was stupid
01:53:10 It's like I think that uh, that you know, we can get into a
01:53:15 Shit, I forgot what I was going to say. I heard a weird noise and it distracted me. Let's play the next fucking speak pipe

01:53:24 Confederate lost cause movement
01:53:26 Three two one go
01:53:28 Hi pancakes here. Listen, you don't have to play this voicemail. I'm just here to tell you something that you might be interested in
01:53:36 You know with all the tearing down statutes and stuff. I feel like you might
01:53:42 Look at the lost cause of the Confederacy
01:53:46 It's uh, it's holy fuck. This is weird. I don't care. Interesting
01:53:51 and fucking no, it's not it's not interesting like what are some of the long lasting impacts
01:53:56 They're the ones that uh
01:53:58 Just did the issue that
01:54:00 Civil war is not based on slavery but based on states rights
01:54:04 Check it out. Oh, he's
01:54:07 Is that it? Do you ever hear a video game? What the fuck? What the fuck was the point of this like?
01:54:12 Yes, I know
01:54:13 I know that they's
01:54:15 Okay, did you ever heard of reddit.com? Did you I know you were talking over a little bit?
01:54:18 So maybe I missed something, but I don't think I did was the point of this just to say that the south
01:54:23 Claimed that it was about states rights
01:54:25 Yes, I know and yes
01:54:26 I know that the conf that the confederate flag was known for for a while as a symbol of lost causes because that's what it is
01:54:32 And it was you know now it's racist or whatever
01:54:35 Um
01:54:36 Did you know that it's and I also happened to know that what is considered today to be the confederate flag was
01:54:41 Is not the flag of the confederacy. It was a battle flag of a regiment in virginia. I mean it just seemed like he was saying
01:54:46 Just look into this thing. It's interesting
01:54:49 Which is fuck you pancakes. Uh, well, he's got the fuck out of here. It's food for oh god
01:54:56 All right, this better be good if you want to redeem yourself. Okay, three two one go
01:55:01 Hi pancakes here. Listen, you know how most people are vegetarians because of the moral implication of killing a certain being for its flesh
01:55:10 Bombs if we reach into the future
01:55:14 Where we no longer grow animals, but like use their dna to just grow the meat itself without
01:55:21 Ascention being being involved
01:55:24 Then for people like tom or something would you be more inclined to tom's not a vegetarian anymore?
01:55:30 Is he no, he's not but I mean obviously his answer that question would be yes, like
01:55:35 Absolutely, obviously anyone who does it for ethical reasons would be like, oh, there's no ethical problem with this food
01:55:42 I guess I'll eat it unless there and problem wasn't like environmental concerns and then it's like oh
01:55:46 Well, what's the impact of this genetic farmer? Are they creating more fossil fuel? Okay easy easy question easy answer pancakes never fucking dark
01:55:53 in my doorstep again

01:59:14 Have I said that yet this episode?
01:59:16 Because it really bears repeating explicitly it's just now, but I'm glad they just keep
01:59:20 Like nate nate keeps it like for the last like week or two nate keeps emailing them and they keep saying like hi
01:59:27 Hi, nate. This is greg filling in for my colleague, george
01:59:30 Thank you for your patience on this matter due to the situation around surrounding covet 19 our staff is limited
01:59:37 And so our backlog is blah blah blah. We appreciate your patience and we will be letting you know when there are developments on your case
01:59:43 Thank you for reaching out appreciate your patience. Love you. I like how I like how the
01:59:48 Disease that causes everybody to have to be in their houses is somehow causing this internet-based company to do less work
01:59:57 Like what the fuck?
01:59:59 I can't work from there. Literally. I guess there's literally no work involved
02:00:03 One person just needs to fucking hit some buttons. Yeah to say undelete the content
02:00:07 Like just fucking undelete maybe the employees have gone from one to zero and it's all robots now
02:00:16 Like it's really frustrating
02:00:19 I feel I feel like they wouldn't lie like it's not that I think they're honest, but I don't see what they gain
02:00:25 by telling us
02:00:27 Be patient. They're just disorganized as fuck if they're not gonna do it
02:00:31 So I feel like at some level they do intend to do it
02:00:36 But will they ever that's the question is a totally different question three months at least I'm thinking
02:00:44 And then they're gonna bring back like half of the videos and we have to do it again
