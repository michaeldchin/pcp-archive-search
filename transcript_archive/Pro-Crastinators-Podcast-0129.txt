00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best
00:00:10 guy ever. Today we're joined by Goblins 1 through 4 and I'm here to slay them all. Goblin
00:00:19 1, aka Ben Goblin. What do goblins sound like in goblin slayer? I haven't uh, I don't partake
00:00:29 I don't partake of the eastern of the eastern scrolls. Yeah, no one knows. Hippo goblin. Ben,
00:00:39 that SFX that just came out of your mouth is like point for point like exactly the same
00:00:45 as the goblin like noise in the Jimmy Neutron video game that I reviewed. Exactly that.
00:00:54 Little Aurora goblin. I am the purple one. And Tom Gobliver. My parents fucked up my name
00:01:06 really bad. Doesn't work at all. Nate, I'm here, I'm gonna collapse a cave on you all,
00:01:13 you're all dead. I am the goblin slayer, that's what I do. Nate. There it is. Nate. Here we
00:01:19 are. Nate. Yeah. Nate. What? Chicken butt. Do you remember as kids on our dad's computer running
00:01:37 Windows 3.11 for work groups? Do you remember a game called Dark Castle?
00:01:53 Not just from that. It was a black and white game. It was like a side scrolling kind of like
00:01:59 puzzle adventure and it was like you go into a dark castle right and it's like you know screen
00:02:04 after screen of like things to do in this dark castle and you know it was way too hard for a
00:02:09 kid like I could I could not figure it out but you know you you would go into a new room and
00:02:14 sometimes there'd be like bats and you could like you could pick up rocks and you could throw them
00:02:18 the control it was it was like tank controls to the to the nth degree it was like first person
00:02:24 this is no no no no it was like it was like a you were a little man in sort of a side scroll
00:02:29 I don't know kind of every screen had its own perspective but anyway I just bring it up because
00:02:33 I remember there was one screen where there were these little like goblins running around
00:02:37 and they would and you would have to throw rocks at them to knock them out and they would make a
00:02:41 sound like I recognize that sound not because of the Jimmy Neutron thing although it's similar
00:02:49 it's because AVGN reviewed Dark Castle and he and he got it right that's right he did he did
00:02:55 and it was an incredible blast from the past because yeah yeah yeah I mentioned guys I've
00:03:01 actually been getting into AVGN recently but specifically I watched one of his game reviews
00:03:06 but the rest of it was just all his like monster madness movie compilation reviews those have been
00:03:11 great those are pretty good times and whatnot yeah those are so good I should get back to
00:03:17 a fucking like he like knows about movies you guys he like knows about like makes them and
00:03:22 everything it's fucking crazy childhood is thinking AVGN is funny adulthood is realizing
00:03:28 that it's all about Bored James no it's terrible no it's the truth Bored James is very funny
00:03:36 I'm looking at his review of Dark Castle right now and this looks vaguely familiar
00:03:41 that's the best I got it's the best I got it's like he's taking you back to your past
00:03:45 hey speaking of getting taken back to the past it's almost to play to play shitty games that
00:03:49 suck ass yeah yeah yeah yeah uh uh my mom came to visit uh as made famous by the last episode of
00:03:56 Shackles for heckles yeah I hate you how how do you how did that how did that go like okay so so I
00:04:04 could not I could not fucking believe you pulled that shit Ben and team was kind of great Shackles
00:04:09 for heckles so always tune in you never know what's gonna happen it was it was well it was it was
00:04:14 munchy and hippo and I jumped in a little late um for for TF2 yeah and I came in to chastise Ben
00:04:21 for being late releasing the pcp episode and uh and I had his mother our mother on deck to yell at
00:04:29 him for being late that's fucking incredible like it was great I like I couldn't I I did not expect
00:04:36 to actually be her so like I was expecting you to have like Michelle do a voice or something
00:04:41 or something like but no I was like oh my god
00:04:49 hippo hippo when like did you accidentally invite Byte instead of Ben to TF2 that time
00:04:56 oh no I was doing it as a meme for like five minutes oh like we need Byte on the team like
00:05:02 he's in an integral part oh yeah he's he's a machine he's just one of the people who was on
00:05:07 my friends list I was just like you have Byte on your team friends list uh yeah from like
00:05:12 way a long time ago huh hey well so the reason I bring up my mom is because there's a topic uh
00:05:18 that I want to bring up related to that uh if you guys just seize the day on that um uh here it is
00:05:25 it's uh uh it's it's how desperately I want to make my parents proud of me is is the topic
00:05:32 I guess I guess making your parents proud or making proud of your boy I'll make you proud
00:05:37 of your boy that's what I feel like all the time and I know Munchie and I I think talked about this
00:05:42 on an episode previously but just having her around was so nice and so great and I so desperately
00:05:48 want to make my parents proud of me uh this is such a major motivation in my life alien concept
00:05:53 you're talking about to me right now that I can't even relate at all well that's interesting too
00:05:58 all right I have I have thoughts maybe because my parents literally dab on your parents and
00:06:04 no like that probably I just I just I have like I guess I have a similar related motivation I just
00:06:10 want to stick it to my parents okay that's okay I feel like those are two sides of the same coins
00:06:16 it really is it's just like it comes from a position of lover brutal hatred uh which is where
00:06:22 I'm coming from I have a lot of gratitude but again what were you saying well I was saying like
00:06:27 I have like I I know the feeling but I also like I have had the bad experience of that where like
00:06:35 trying to make my parents proud was like like a thing that fucked me up in school because I tried
00:06:40 really hard but I was really depressed and they didn't understand because I never talked about it
00:06:45 and it was and it was because I was trying so hard to make them happy and then they said
00:06:49 but we want you to be happy and I was like oh okay you know like I was I was severely fucked up in
00:06:55 the head and that like has ruined my my whole childhood and like I never really talked about it
00:07:00 like that so like and now having gone through that I I don't necessarily want to make them unhappy
00:07:06 I don't hate you know but like I'm I'm more like for me and then I guess yeah that's very
00:07:13 understandable um I mean that's what parents want right they want their kid to be happy well they
00:07:18 want them to be happy but I mean I talk about this and I think about this a lot it's like like I
00:07:22 want to do the things I want to do in life but I want to like make them feel not worried and
00:07:29 like content I just got I don't know what what changed at some point I just became so focused on
00:07:35 like wanting my parents to be happy with what I'm doing and you know what I say that but then like
00:07:40 I call them fairly rarely they're just like it's like a daemon in my mind you know my my desire
00:07:46 to make my parents proud I mean is that like a societal thing like you said I wouldn't be
00:07:51 fucking sick if I just fit in I you know I was probably one of the guys yeah um I'm pretty I feel
00:07:59 like I don't know it sort of feels like a sycophane task you know you're like like I don't know like
00:08:07 you're never gonna be perfect right I always never maximize this I always felt like I always felt
00:08:12 like attempts to do good attempts to do good and make the parents proud we're not generally met with
00:08:19 like any greater enthusiasm I don't know than than any other time I always felt like well I always felt
00:08:26 like trying hard to do that was sort of pointless well I think the maximum way like based on everything
00:08:31 that mom and dad always said grown up I think the maximum way to make my parents happy and proud
00:08:37 would be to be incredibly successful at something that I love doing yeah and being financially
00:08:43 secure so that they don't have to worry and you know like all the it's never going to be perfect
00:08:47 of course so that's why I think it's a large part of why I'm so economically well I mean you've you
00:08:51 I mean I mean you've you've done all that so so you're fine but I'm not I'm not I don't know
00:08:56 like I think about this a lot too our whole generation has such low standards for quote
00:09:01 unquote making it yeah mine are much higher than I think a lot of other people and so I just think
00:09:09 like like I mean for example like dad's career as a psychologist and stuff is like way beyond
00:09:15 anything like like what youtuber I wonder what tier of youtuber do you have to be at to be like at
00:09:21 the level of like earning as stable and good a living as like a professional psychologist
00:09:27 I would estimate it's massive I would estimate maybe maybe if you're in the 10 tens of millions
00:09:32 yeah exactly yeah exactly um and like as a as a programmer right now I do like so much
00:09:38 better financially doing that than youtube and I know I'm still a small youtuber but
00:09:42 it's like uh I don't know like I really want to do all those things that I love doing but I'm very
00:09:47 concerned about doing it in a sustainable way so that nobody they don't have to worry about me
00:09:53 and I don't know sounds like it's holding you back you material success always just seemed like a
00:09:58 rigged a rigged game to me you know but it's there I mean obviously there's a lower threshold
00:10:03 you have to be no one who wins it no one who wins that game says yeah I made it and now I'm happy
00:10:10 well some people do it's what it's a security blanket sort of thing I think yeah it's like a
00:10:14 safety net more than anything else well I mean obviously having enough that you're not in financial
00:10:19 peril is good but I mean like like having a million in the bank so that you can just go try to be a
00:10:25 huge I mean our dad is not I mean our dad is not rich right like our dad like we're not we're not
00:10:31 rich per se but like I think I think I think I've heard that like something like 50 or $60,000 a year
00:10:39 is like the cutoff point where like happiness does not increase beyond that I believe that was 70,000
00:10:44 and that that is the peak and after that it goes down if you if you go up I'm pretty sure our dad
00:10:48 makes more than that maybe not by that much yeah yeah yeah he makes more than that and like you know
00:10:56 I mean I'm not criticizing the guy for making money but yeah I don't but I think that in in
00:11:02 his case it's he's it holds true that more money does not increase happiness you know okay Ben
00:11:06 you're totally right but all of us here today are significantly below that threshold wait even so
00:11:12 just saying that there's even even not wait no wait not you with your real ass job I am actually
00:11:17 above that threshold at this point yeah obviously obviously uh well I mean it's it's a it's a thing
00:11:25 of like living well within your means like like as long as you're happy with less then you don't
00:11:32 need as much money and I agree that like it seems like people of our generation have lower standards
00:11:38 for what would be considered good enough my standards are too low I'll just I'll just come right
00:11:44 out my standards are too low I'm glad that you admit it yeah but like yeah but like it's it's not just
00:11:50 because like oh our generation is lazy it's also like like things are more expensive and jobs are
00:11:56 harder to find and like that it's not exactly the same criticism isn't about laziness so that the
00:12:02 generation is bad it's that like for whatever reason like their standards were just made to be lower
00:12:08 that like because everyone wants to be like a starving youtube artist or something and obviously
00:12:12 not everybody but like in in my circles like guys like like really Ben is the worst of the worst
00:12:18 absolutely you know you know I'm just I'm just it's a rigged game material success is a rigged
00:12:24 game I'm convinced I don't disagree I mean if you're shooting for like your money and possessions
00:12:29 aren't gonna make you happy when you're about and I and I know and I know that my I know that my
00:12:33 standards are too low and as a result I am I mean you know I'm motivated I don't know I'm not
00:12:38 unmotivated but I am I am I'm I've kind of I've sort of let myself be content with enough to get
00:12:47 buy on but not enough to like be secure exactly Ben's an economical chameleon able to adapt to
00:12:54 whatever situation he siphides himself in pretty much damn um humans can adapt to anything do you
00:13:01 feel this whole thing about want to make your parents proud I mean obviously to some degree
00:13:05 but I'm just curious what you think oh yeah like I've been I used to have like this terrible
00:13:10 terrible issue of um feeling like I've disappointed my parents because I feel like a lot of sort of
00:13:15 you're just a lowly artist after all so that's a that's a blow to the old parent ego I'm sure
00:13:21 kind of like that was a joke and you guys did not rebut it so I'm uh no I mean I mean we're all
00:13:28 creative people yeah you guys all know no this is terrible so we're all like yeah no no no that's
00:13:32 true okay I just feel like my parents invested a lot of hope in me and I kind of disappointed them
00:13:38 at least that's how I felt I don't feel like that anymore but it took me a lot but yeah yeah I mean
00:13:45 it's excuse me I mean every parent has no idea what a child is until it's already grown up and
00:13:51 then well I have a sister especially if you're the older one and I have an older sister yeah maybe
00:13:57 your older sister really fucked up I don't know if this is true or not and they were hoping that you
00:14:00 would be the one to save the day which is what I am for our parents for sure she's doing quite quite
00:14:06 well actually but but she has like I don't want to get into it because it's personal for her so but
00:14:11 like yeah I should have I should have killed you in the cradle when I had the chance to like now
00:14:15 motherfucker oh no all right all right I want to go around the room okay how many of you your parents
00:14:23 were like how many of these child fulfill my fantasies because I failed no well our parents
00:14:30 were definitely not like not like they were very encouraging yeah about what we wanted a lot of
00:14:34 my pressure I feel I was self-inflicted yeah with myself did did you have any of that kid no because
00:14:40 like if I like I used to think like oh shit I got it I got to do all the the stuff I got to be the
00:14:47 perfect boy because I like my parents and I want to make them I don't want to make them unhappy
00:14:52 but like if I thought about like their decision to bring me into the world it wasn't so that I could
00:14:57 become you know the prime minister or whatever it was just so that they could have like a nice family
00:15:02 and then as long as I'm a nice son that's all it really matters yeah I just treat them right and
00:15:07 that's it I what about you Tom yeah my parents like they don't my parents don't really even have
00:15:13 dreams that they even want to pass on to me uh my dad's a writer though that sounds like he writes
00:15:19 the only reason he even started writing is because I told him to so I'm gonna take credit for that
00:15:24 but uh no like my parents they're just like they have a very specific vision of what they want me
00:15:28 to be like they just like please please son get get a real salary job and stop like hobbling around
00:15:36 and and just like being a piece of shit and I'm just like no I like I love being in the gutter
00:15:45 it's so comfortable the slime I just like it gives me solace at night I have another I have one more
00:15:52 thing about why it's a rig game not just material success but pleasing your parents specifically
00:15:58 as a rig game because as the old saying goes parents will never get it right I suppose yeah
00:16:05 I mean how how many parents like really know their kids like you know what I think about Ben
00:16:11 all that all that all that all that parents know like all that most parents like they have some idea
00:16:16 of what their kid does like like our parents don't understand don't really understand what we do
00:16:21 right they and and I think that's probably true for most people like they'll know they'll know
00:16:26 their kids job title they might know what the one or two things that they will have loose associations
00:16:31 that they make oh my son's a lawyer oh my son's a dentist or whatever but they don't know right like
00:16:37 all they want well they wouldn't know like if I was like I'm a programmer they also don't understand
00:16:41 what that consists of yeah well exactly yeah so they can so they can say oh my son's oh my son's
00:16:46 a programmer oh my son's a programmer and that's fine you know that probably is pleading but it's
00:16:50 just aesthetic like like for them on the parent side it's just an aesthetic thing and say oh my
00:16:55 son's a programmer oh my son's an artist yeah it doesn't always the real they don't they don't
00:16:59 experience the reality of it and I feel like it's a fool's game not always though like I have a friend
00:17:05 and her mom is very very involved in her activities and stuff and she always knows what's up so well
00:17:10 that's not that's not me well I think it's not so much like literal like they don't get it it's that
00:17:17 like for them being a parent is an entirely different lifestyle that they've known so
00:17:22 everything they're doing is like they're full of stress they're like oh shit this is my life is
00:17:25 completely different now I've got to try and adapt to it like by the time they're grandparents then
00:17:30 they get you like grandparents and and and grandchildren like well my grandma so can't
00:17:37 wrap her head around the concept of the computer I mean it's it's not it's not like the the the
00:17:41 literal like what the kids are doing but the fact that like what you know how to raise a kid
00:17:47 like like the fact that it's new and it's different and it's challenging and it's all this stuff and
00:17:51 it's like a grandparent would would get it a bit better because they're not they're not in that like
00:17:56 you know they've done it already they can see it happening again they're like ah yeah I got this
00:18:00 I think the difference there is that like a parent a parent has the job of making their
00:18:05 kid as good as they can be a grandparent has almost zero responsibility so they can just
00:18:10 chill and like connect with the kid it's it's why it's why grandparents and uncles and aunts are
00:18:14 like more fun a lot of the time absolutely they don't have to be the disciplinarian or anything
00:18:18 but I was gonna say about uh to to Ben's point I kind of do agree with the whole um parents will
00:18:24 never get it never get a thing to a to a pretty large that's not even just that's not even just
00:18:29 like an edgy teen thing I just think like parent unless you're unless you're one of those kids
00:18:34 who has who's like super close oh best friends with my mom who but I but I make I'm making a
00:18:40 jerking off gesture right now good um yeah I was listening to Joe Rogan's podcast he had Billy
00:18:45 Corrigan on who is the main guy from uh Smashing Pumpkins and like Smashing Pumpkins is like a
00:18:51 huge world-renowned band super famous whatever point is um uh like Billy Corrigan was talking
00:18:57 about how like he had I believe he said it was his grandpa and like in his family they got that he
00:19:02 was like a big deal but his grandpa even when he was like a platinum selling like huge deal
00:19:07 didn't give a shit until like until until like was he on Oprah or something no no no none of that
00:19:14 stuff made any difference to this guy but it was when he found out how much money that his son was
00:19:19 making that's when he was well now I get it now I understand people care about this and that's
00:19:25 why I'm saying Ben the parents won't care they'll never understand exactly what you do as nobody
00:19:29 can really understand what's going on in your job pretty much unless they're in the same exact field
00:19:33 but they'll understand if you have that dollars in the bank my dude that's what they'll understand
00:19:39 the universe that's how my parents work because they wanted to take it from me as soon as they
00:19:43 thought I was making money they immediately started charging me to stay in their house despite despite
00:19:48 my charging you rent what villains am I right I don't mind paying rent now guys now I don't mind
00:19:54 paying rent the thing was that it was as soon as they found out that I had money it's like oh we can't
00:19:59 let you keep this now we will we'll take it more like the fact that you can't pay me no no no no
00:20:04 you gotta you gotta understand the full context the full context was I was working a job yes
00:20:09 then I got uh laid off then I got on patreon and then they were like oh uh now that you're making
00:20:15 money online we need to charge you rent but if you go get a real job again you can stay for free
00:20:21 that is a little bit uh a little bit iffy my dude fuck your dreams go be a slave was was pretty
00:20:26 much the message I got from that point okay guys guys guys so uh um earlier I did sort of protest
00:20:32 against uh Ben's argument but like I do agree with him to to an extent like a big extent the the
00:20:38 one I mentioned was mostly an exception because from my experience is Ben is quite right at least
00:20:44 in my experience like I think the people that are close with their parents are kind of creepy
00:20:48 personally yeah yeah I love our parents my whole family has no idea what I'm doing online sorry I
00:20:56 was just saying that like I love my mom I love having her around but like I love to see her once
00:21:01 it's not even that I don't like to see her it's that we don't have a ton in common actually yeah
00:21:06 so yeah I know we've got like our whole lives I mean so that's fair we can talk about any of
00:21:10 that shit but uh it's like I think all the time about just like working and editing and being online
00:21:15 and doing this stuff and you know my job and stuff and uh I think she wants to hear about that so you
00:21:20 know yeah it's different I think there should always be like a healthy awkwardness when it comes
00:21:25 to parent child yeah because like with your siblings like you are the same like you know
00:21:31 you get it you you know you're basically the same age you you would understand each other a little
00:21:37 um you should always know your siblings better than your parents like if your parent comes in
00:21:41 and watches sees you watching a youtube video that's kind of weird like you should be a little
00:21:46 like ASMR slime uh goop extravaganza you know it should be it should be awkward because if it's
00:21:53 not awkward then either your parent is too as I hastily put my dick away yeah like you are doing
00:21:58 like you were doing like the too much of a normie thing my sister just don't understand me like at
00:22:04 all like the difference between me and my sister is she's significantly older than you right like
00:22:11 six six years I think but she's so she's such a normie like like like a month ago or so that
00:22:18 should be a buzz sound of mage going she's such a normie I want that your sister sounds like exactly
00:22:24 the kind of person who would get hello fresh like that coward monkey white picket fence 2.5 kids
00:22:32 ass motherfucker there was a great voicemail about hello fresh I can't wait to get to she does have a
00:22:36 house and she does have a challenge she's gonna maybe get a second one my sister turned into a
00:22:41 normie and it's been this slow decline that's just depressing me to no end let me let me tell you
00:22:46 let me tell you a quick story about my sister I just kind of made me sad like a month ago or so
00:22:51 she was like hey I was talking to my boss about you and like I have nothing to say about you
00:22:55 because I don't know what you're doing could you like send me some of your drawing so I could show
00:22:59 it to her I was like okay that was weird but you know why why are you talking to your boss with me
00:23:04 about me yeah but yeah I sent a few pictures a few drawings to her and she was like oh all of them
00:23:11 except for this one are ugly
00:23:19 she's been like this for like forever like the last time I showed her a drawing was back in
00:23:24 my pony days and I showed her a drawing of a pony and she was like is is that a flower and I'm like
00:23:29 never showing you anything ever again and then I made the mistake of showing her stuff we need to
00:23:33 get a picture of mage's sister put it on that meme of the guy and just be like have the have your
00:23:38 drawing like is this a flower oh yeah oh yeah yeah that's a we need clearly no observational skills
00:23:45 whatsoever hey I've got I've got uh an extension of this topic slightly which is ties into a couple
00:23:52 things that just happened to me earlier today uh which was so so um another way I want to make
00:23:58 my parents proud and to like be a real man this is definitely more of a socially influenced thing
00:24:02 is I want to be able to like fix things and repair things and you know be a man and that in that
00:24:06 kind of way and I'll uh so so I was using Michelle's uh electric skateboard and stuff
00:24:12 and you're using it a ton and having a great time but a week ago it broke and it wasn't
00:24:17 fucking working and it was expensive so I was I was very upset and I thought that I had broken a
00:24:21 thing through excessive use this is very sad to me but like a man I took it apart I found the
00:24:28 problem it was that one of the rubber bands had worn one of the rubber like treads had worn out
00:24:33 from excessive use excessive hardcore grinding and rail riding uh naturally ordered the part
00:24:39 got here yesterday replaced it myself was out there killing it and having a great time and
00:24:44 being a hero and I love fixing things also side note I fell for the first time off the skateboard
00:24:50 and got a big old fucking raspberry on my fucking arm and I was posted for you now in chat so you
00:24:57 can all enjoy I don't think I want to see my wound I'm not sure they used raspberry I don't think
00:25:01 that is what it's right right raspberries are like raspberry is what will ferrell said in uh
00:25:07 anchorman when uh jack black fell off his motorcycle and had a bunch of scars and you know you blow
00:25:12 raspberry you don't get a raspberry from you mean an indian burn he said raspberry and anchorman
00:25:19 god damn it he's he's he's he's he's not even human well the point is I love fixing things and
00:25:27 repairing things uh and it was great yeah and I'm better than all of you because I did when you feel
00:25:32 good about fixing shit it's like yeah yeah it was broken that's right that's why you wear longer
00:25:38 that protectionate uh well I actually you could have stuffed this as a matter of fact mage I actually
00:25:45 was wearing my hoodie I got this through the sleeve of my hoodie so if I wasn't wearing it
00:25:50 I could only imagine how fucked up either yeah pretty rough I actually I hit a patch of wet grass
00:25:57 on a black top and just went whoa plop sick it was pretty dope I was actually I'm now I've
00:26:04 gotten my first fall and I feel good about it it's out of the way um I'm gonna be shredding your
00:26:09 neighborhood soon listener so keep an eye out for me spot me in your hometown I'm doing a cross
00:26:14 country tour I'm gonna fall on your lawn and sue you uh okay that's all I had to say do you guys
00:26:20 enjoy building things Tom you build computers I think you can relate to this it's fucking it's
00:26:25 it's a good feeling I've been like building more computers than ever because like we're returning
00:26:29 digi house into a cyberpunk 2077 technocratic future state uh dope there are computers everywhere
00:26:37 it's insane ordering parts all the time building things fixing things getting pissed off and things
00:26:42 this is all part of going full games uh a part of it yeah some of it just like I I just had a
00:26:49 bunch of shit lying around and I was like oh yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do this I guess I'm
00:26:53 gonna sell it did you just like no just bring it over here I'm like okay so now there's like a
00:26:56 computer in every room in the house for no reason and uh yeah and and I'm building one for May that
00:27:03 I had just hitting around I'm gonna upgrade that make that cool because like they broke their laptop
00:27:07 like three times in a row and it was funny okay the screen just falls out now and it's it's insane
00:27:12 yeah so I'm just I've just become the IT for I am game that's my job description it's real
00:27:19 oh good and that's what I do and uh yeah fantastic uh I can I can do other pools I can dovetail
00:27:27 into a new topic from here is that okay yeah go for it go in terms of technology and just in general
00:27:32 we have been having so much technical difficulties with trying to get I am games to work because
00:27:38 every time we switch it to a different game we got to change the entire setup get to unplug
00:27:43 everything and plug everything back in and then there's always something that breaks or doesn't
00:27:47 work and even in like my personal work doing like working on the game and and trying to just like
00:27:53 make computer shit work like digis uh motherboard didn't work for some reason so we had to send
00:27:57 that back and then like for some reason like my stream capture software on my big 12 core processor
00:28:03 can't record more than 20 fps unless I disable windows arrow I'm like there's a bunch of bullshit
00:28:08 that just constantly happens and I don't like like someone I ordered a new cpu for maze computer
00:28:14 I have to send that back because even though it's like the right kind it just doesn't fit in the
00:28:18 slot even though there's no reason it shouldn't be so I just want to get like a t-shirt that just says
00:28:23 it should be working but it's not because that's my entire life these are the kind of things that
00:28:29 make me want to kill myself and not put up with life anymore maybe you should maybe the t-shirt
00:28:34 should have a computer with a little speech bubble that says I'm supposed to be working right now
00:28:41 oh my god I am games oh and on the back there's a big I am games x pcp thing or something it's
00:28:47 like crossover damn that's good I could make that immediately we did I did just make a brand
00:28:53 new shirt for iam games yesterday and it was great the pcp will take a cool 98% of the profits from
00:28:59 that well I'm in both ventures so I double dip on the price that's true damn just saw this elbow
00:29:04 it looks it looks painful uh yeah it hurts a lot right now as a matter of fact you can see the skin
00:29:09 just scraped right off like with its ice cream scoop describe it with a tiny ice cream scoop just
00:29:17 I feel your description is worse than the image itself stop that's that's true the image it does
00:29:23 just look like a raspberry yeah yeah it's even got kind of like bumps on it the way I read well
00:29:28 Farrell is such a wordsmith I guess so yeah he's created a new phrase that did not exist before
00:29:34 I'm angry with him because I swear like blowing a raspberry it's like it's like yeah like it does
00:29:39 not leave a mark it's just like yeah mage you're you're absolutely right that this is a new
00:29:43 this is a new neologism playful with language and uh yeah raspberries can be many things sometimes
00:29:49 creativity try it out sometime yeah maybe send that to your sister when she went to ask what you do
00:29:55 stop drawing flowers mage get get more creative speaking of physical maladies
00:30:01 yeah um so I'm dying last week I was talking about how I could feel a cough coming on yeah it did
00:30:09 it did yeah we're all well aware at this point my throat hurt pretty bad for a while but that
00:30:14 went away and I thought I was over it but then I've just been I've just had like a I've had a
00:30:18 what what a what a doctor might describe as a productive cough uh forever since then is this
00:30:23 is a keto induced illness or no no absolutely no this happened this happened after I went to
00:30:31 I am games I'm pretty sure that I am games made me sick uh it had to be okay so it's a video game
00:30:36 we are just in yeah video game made me sick and now I'm like well now I'll like start breathing
00:30:42 and my breath will be all like oh yeah it'll all be all crunchy in my lungs because it's
00:30:47 mega man 11 literally gives you cancer conferred do you guys feel uh when you feel like that
00:30:54 afraid to go to sleep because you're afraid that you'll die in your sleep and your body just won't
00:30:58 be able to breathe yes but I'm all the time well I'm not about this not about a cough but about
00:31:02 things like a fever or something yeah like an asthma okay I've always suspected I have asthma
00:31:07 it's not for me it's not even when I go to sleep it's just all day every day even right now like
00:31:12 what if I just die I'm afraid this the switch is just gonna get flipped uh you know oh yeah I
00:31:18 I used to be really paranoid I think I'm a little less so nowadays but yeah yeah there was a time
00:31:22 when I was like what if I just die what if I just drop dead for no reason what if my heart just stops
00:31:26 you one could fixate their whole life on that but yeah I sort of get what you're saying but
00:31:32 like I don't fear death because like shit found like when you're gonna be dead you're not gonna
00:31:36 care that you're dead yeah I mean yeah when I'm dead I won't care but the me that is alive now
00:31:44 cares that I will be dead then and it's a separate for the living for sure if you're not gonna notice
00:31:50 that you're dead but no but but I notice now right now I'm afraid of it I understand the feeling
00:31:57 of I get what you're saying but I don't agree of feeling because like it isn't a rational thing
00:32:02 my room has as like a lot of dust in it and it has had a lot of dust ever since uh we like
00:32:09 refurbished the room underneath it and like the floor was all torn up and put back down
00:32:14 I need to re-go over it because there's dust there's like bits in the wall they're sort of
00:32:18 cracking and I know that every time I go to bed I think this is there's there's just dust in the
00:32:23 air there's dust all over the place and sometimes when I go to bed I'm like I'm breathing it in
00:32:27 I can feel it going down my throat and I'm like all right I know in the morning I'm gonna be
00:32:32 you know smokers cough like here yeah I'll be fine later but like it's happened too many times
00:32:40 and I haven't done anything about it and it's sort of like I feel like this room that I'm in
00:32:45 has given me like an eternal cold that is not debilitating but like it's just like
00:32:51 I'm sort of stuffed up at all times with like dryness but like it's never really it can't
00:32:59 like I don't remember what it feels like to not be stuffed up and it's the sort of it's the sort
00:33:05 of thing where it happens for so long that I'm not even really sure whether it's happening or not
00:33:10 maybe I'm just like losing my sense of smell normally and this is why we need transhumanism
00:33:15 I'm so I mean that's true we need uh uh okay so first of all somebody please draw a picture of
00:33:21 Gibb uh eyes wide open bloodshot staring up the clouds of dust hanging over him as he tries to
00:33:26 sleep it's not a lot of dust but like over the course of like months and months like I haven't
00:33:31 I haven't even put a put a I don't know a water in here I don't know what you're supposed to do
00:33:37 about dust like a lack of dust you just put dust in there you got a dust yeah I gotta remove the dust
00:33:44 do I mean okay the right thing to do is to like to rip down the walls and then re-plaster them
00:33:49 because the plus I was gonna say if it like if more is coming from the walls uh I don't know
00:33:54 what's to be done about that I gotta move maybe go to different room I guess I mean yeah it's it's
00:34:01 not like every night is terrible but like occasionally it'll be like oh yeah fuck I think it's like
00:34:07 it it it it adds to a cold like it's cold like I might have a cold now but like it's made it so
00:34:14 that the line has the the line has blurred between having a cold and not having a cold
00:34:19 like I sort of like suddenly I'm like I'm sneezing I'm like oh wait am I sneezing or do
00:34:24 I have a cough or no and actually I'm fine like I sometimes I just don't know and I think I'm dead
00:34:30 I think no one should live in that kind of in between world the twilight it's kind of weird
00:34:35 it's kind of weird to be constantly not sure and kind of definitely sure that I am sick I just
00:34:41 remembered something that that kind of relates to this topic of of death and sleep and stuff
00:34:47 so back in my so back in my Lithuanian home and in this room that I usually stay in the layout
00:34:53 has changed over years every now and then and like there used to be like the where the bed is now
00:34:59 it used to be on the opposite side and there's a shelf like where it used to be okay there used
00:35:04 to be a shelf on the side where the bed is right now and the thing is back when the bed was on the
00:35:10 other side one night the shelf just kind of fell and it like it was the big crash in the middle of
00:35:17 the night as well and it it spooked me really really bad and that was back when I was living there
00:35:22 but now whenever I go over during the summer I have to sleep under the same shelf that fell at night
00:35:30 oh no that's a real uh what's that sword the edipus
00:35:33 damocles? sort of damocles? thankfully the shelf has been removed this year so I actually
00:35:40 managed to sleep peacefully oh man that's nice I mean who the fuck would want to sleep under that
00:35:44 I'd be freaking out the whole time oh I thought you said like you you had to as in like I just
00:35:49 want to feel that rush like at any moment all night while I'm sleeping I can't I can't sleep without
00:35:58 that adrenaline I have the same paranoia whenever I have to sleep but whenever I sleep on a bunk
00:36:03 bed I'm always like if I'm on the bottom bunk like the top one's gonna follow me I'm fucking dead
00:36:08 to be to be quite fair like I'm not that scared of dying myself I just feel like it would be an
00:36:14 inconvenience because I want stuff like I want to do some stuff in my life and I haven't done it yet
00:36:19 I was like well I don't want to understand that's where a lot of the fear for me comes from is just
00:36:22 that like I if there's so much not on the table yet there's so much I still have to do I just I
00:36:27 just be annoyed if if there's some sort of afterlife I just be annoyed just like well I wanted to
00:36:32 do this thing and now I can gosh you know it's it's weird before like bucket lists and stuff because
00:36:38 I I never felt like I remember like as a young child like oh shit a bucket list is things you
00:36:43 have to do before you die and like every cartoon has that episode where the character thinks they're
00:36:47 gonna die and they do everything on their bucket list and I'm like I should write my own and then
00:36:52 I it it's just never actually appealed to me to have a list of things I need to do because I don't
00:36:58 I don't know I just don't care I guess there's some things I I guess I take things as they come
00:37:05 that's fair now that I've like been to Hawaii like I feel like that would be something that I would
00:37:10 have put on except I've already done it but like I'm sure like it's made me think about like other
00:37:14 things I'd like to do because travel munchies right guys travel is so great yeah it's so worth
00:37:19 doing to go to amazing places and I hate travel well fair you do it more than most of us I think but
00:37:26 probably more sick I do it pretty well she does it like once like twice a year she goes from one
00:37:30 place to another that's not an obligation though I guess I don't like I don't like traveling from
00:37:37 country to country I guess through the yeah you think you think it's hard going from country to
00:37:41 country over there in Europe it's just it's way easier like getting out of America is so much
00:37:46 harder although once Britain's out of the EU that might be yeah I'm thinking of doing like an EU
00:37:52 like a mega a trip just so I can see all of it before I'm locked out and forever that's a great
00:37:58 idea you really should do that I yeah I like that a lot I don't care how much hard it is I just don't
00:38:05 like the traveling aspect it was like so many people so many stupid inconveniences and waiting
00:38:11 in line waiting in lines with a lot of people I hate it I hate public places I like hang on hang on
00:38:16 I want to answer this question again if you had to go one place in the EU what's your number one
00:38:20 place you want to go I had to go one place um I would like to go Auschwitz please one ticket to
00:38:26 Auschwitz I mean I I'd visit I'd visit yeah but I want to go to Hamburg because I haven't been
00:38:32 I'd go there and press F
00:38:37 I was laughing at the meme would you say I'd go to Hamburg um because I've never really been to
00:38:43 Germany properly like I'd stayed there a little bit um for an animation thing but like um it's a
00:38:48 country that is cool and it's also not incredibly hot so that I won't die maybe it's a true Brit
00:38:56 you should go to I forget the town where the European Union is based in Germany but you should
00:39:00 consider blowing it up like uh you know like who's that who's that guy guy fox guy fuck pull a guy
00:39:06 fox on the EU and be a be a real best guy ever for no best guy forks damn it that's guy best guy
00:39:12 forks ever yeah that's it hey but what you need to do is you just you need to go to all the places
00:39:17 you want to go in the EU we need to make a vlog series about it called eulogy because it's dying
00:39:23 not bad not pretty good
00:39:27 make it happen now I hear that cat me yeah no that's not mine it's my cat my my cats oh my god
00:39:33 Luna get out of here oh no now you're having the same problems I used to I can't if I stand up I have
00:39:39 to take my headphones off and I can't hear anything um hey now you know my pain now you know my pain
00:39:46 I feel like I've talked a lot this episode I don't want to dominate but I do have a very funny
00:39:51 short story that I thought I'd bring up the thing is I don't know if I've told it before
00:39:54 have I told a story about me my dad and a roller coaster game in the past have I told the story
00:39:59 roller coaster not that I remember okay forgive me if I've told it before but I'm gonna tell it again
00:40:05 I was I was thinking about this I was telling this to Michelle and I just realized what a great
00:40:09 story this is um so okay so one day me and my this is the story of one of the worst things I've ever
00:40:15 done in my life uh is is what it is this is I think about this memory haunted by the ghosts of
00:40:22 what I did in this story to my dad and and so this is what it is this is what it is so I was around
00:40:28 I was probably around between 12 and 15 probably something around there and me and my dad it was
00:40:34 just totally normal we were at like some kind of store like a what's called like building 19 or
00:40:39 something or like oh dude I love building 19 yeah I think it was a store like that kind of just
00:40:44 suffer a little save a lot yeah yeah they're cool and um uh like as we're we just went to buy some
00:40:51 stuff my daddy cabling or tubes or something or whatever and uh and we're leaving and as we're
00:40:56 leaving I spy on the side of the of like the aisle there's like a game there and it's a roller coaster
00:41:01 game for the pc and it's not roller coaster tycoon it's something like like roller coaster builder
00:41:06 simulator 2000 or something some like nondescript totally unaffiliate with any big thing roller
00:41:13 coaster building game it's like an engineering sort of thing and I see this game and for some
00:41:19 unexplained reason I'm filled with lust for this game just immoral passionate massive lust to play
00:41:28 this roller coaster game he's a young man he's gotta have it sometimes yeah and so I say dad
00:41:35 you need to buy me this game and he's like he's like well uh oh okay um by the way this game is
00:41:42 like it was like 10 to 15 dollars I'm gonna say 15 or something and I'm like I don't have any money
00:41:47 on me and I'm just like I didn't have much at the time anyway dad buy me this game he's like oh uh and
00:41:53 my dad never buys me stuff um or not it's not that he's mean he's just you know like why would he uh
00:41:58 but but in this one situation I'm like dad buy me this game I need it I need this game that's pretty
00:42:04 frugal yeah yeah yeah and my dad he's just like he's just baffled understandably he's like Nate why
00:42:09 do you want this you really like this is the thing you want so bad and I'm just saying yes
00:42:14 yes I want it so bad uh I'm going to play it forever I say to my dad meanwhile in my mind
00:42:20 I know I don't even want this game that bad I don't even really give a shit why just why this game
00:42:26 I don't know I'm being so too faced in what I'm saying to my dad I'm manipulating him intentionally
00:42:33 pretending I have these strong emotions because I just kind of want to play this game a little bit
00:42:38 who wins in this situation what was that saying our lord and master who wins in this scenario
00:42:45 no one wins because oh I beg and plead convince him to buy this game and he really thinks he's
00:42:51 doing something real nice for me and he's it was it was a touching moment for him for me it was a
00:42:56 purely evil moment and so we get home we install the game on the computer I play it one time for
00:43:02 like an hour and I was super bored and don't give a shit and I never play it again I I just manipulated
00:43:09 my dad into spending $15 he didn't need to spend uh and it was the most evil I've felt about pretty
00:43:16 much anything in my life years later this was like a year ago or something I remember that this
00:43:20 happened and I just I throw myself at my dad's feet he didn't know any of this he just thought he
00:43:25 done something nice for me but I'm just like dad I need to confess something to you I I did a bad
00:43:32 thing and I tell him this whole story and he's just like oh I don't care it's fine yeah yeah nobody
00:43:38 gives it and so just I believe it was just yesterday I tell this whole story to my mom who's visiting
00:43:45 and she just looks at me you know Michelle's there and she just my mom looks at me just like
00:43:49 god you're boring
00:43:59 so my question for the group is do you like rollercoasters
00:44:04 wait what no nothing I do you like
00:44:07 oh yeah yeah so that we get the expert divu on on the show we do yeah yeah it would have been good
00:44:14 to have him here uh yeah I just I just get consumed by these tiny immoral things I've done in the
00:44:20 past this is what I'm talking about this is what I'm talking about you think you think you do a
00:44:25 thing you're you think your parents will feel such in such a way and they just don't like I've
00:44:30 there's been so like so many times like I thought parents would be mad and they didn't give a
00:44:34 shit so many times I thought they'd be pleased and they didn't give a shit in fact almost all
00:44:38 the time they just didn't give a shit I'm seeing up I'm starting to see a pattern here well they
00:44:42 sure they've they've they've given up they've let the the ship sail up to be fair though to be
00:44:46 fair though I didn't really think that my dad would care that much I just thought that this is
00:44:50 just something that really bothers me that I did and so I had to it's a good example of like
00:44:56 doing doing anything for your parents say doing anything to make them proud it's like it's a
00:45:01 fool's game you it's sysaphy and task you will never get that boulder up the hill in fact factoring
00:45:08 no seriously I factoring anyone else's feelings into any of your decisions at any time is a
00:45:14 fool's errand and is a mistake and will result in greater suffering for the world yeah it's going
00:45:19 too far no it's not no it's not you need to it's like you need to just eliminate you have to put
00:45:27 yourself first in any and all things you know it doesn't make any sense it does not make any sense
00:45:32 to do otherwise I think I know why that is for anyone it's it's because they made you and then
00:45:37 they were tasked with like making sure you didn't die for like 10 years oh and and then they had to
00:45:42 like deal with you being a teenager and all right well it's 18 20 whatever yeah once you hit 10
00:45:49 you they give you they give you a pokemon and they shove you out the first door like they do all
00:45:56 that stuff and then by the time you're an adult they're like just I'm done with you yeah they're
00:46:01 you're boring to me it's time to cash the chips in at that point it's time for you to go away and
00:46:06 then uh like put me in a home come back uh uh yeah I mean that's fair enough it's fair enough
00:46:13 you know the bend your point there reminds me uh I didn't really understand uh well what you're
00:46:18 saying reminds me of objectivism as explained by rucka rucka Ali in the podcast I did with him
00:46:23 about objectivism which I'm sure one could learn more about but it was I didn't fully agree with
00:46:28 him on this or that like that I subscribe to this belief but it was that like there's kind of an
00:46:32 inherent almost spiritual value in like pursuing one's own goals as opposed to like worrying about
00:46:39 society so maybe you uh you're a little bit of an objectivist in that in that way I mean I think so
00:46:45 yeah I don't know I sure as soon as everyone else is an object I really feel I really feel like when
00:46:52 you put like you can like you can factor others desires into your decisions as data points
00:46:59 for you to make an informed decision but when you put other people's needs above your own I just
00:47:05 it never a little cook it never works yeah it just doesn't like it just doesn't work I just
00:47:11 find that even if the goal is to like oh well we'll get this person what they want I just don't
00:47:16 ever feel like they actually are happy to receive the thing that you think they want it's like people
00:47:21 don't know what they want well it would be more like I think what you're gonna say is like you would
00:47:28 do things to make people happy so that they would then do things for you it's like or just that it
00:47:32 makes you happy that they're happy like but yeah like it would all come down to like yeah self-serving
00:47:38 things but like yeah if you don't feel like your parents give a shit then that isn't going to make
00:47:42 you happy it's kind of like that expression happy wife happy life which is just like yeah like if
00:47:46 you're married you know make your wife happy it'll make your life easy because you know you want to
00:47:50 just like yeah I reckon the only way I have the only way I interface with the universe at all
00:47:56 is my own level of happiness and I'm just aware that if I make the world around me happy and
00:48:00 better it'll be better for me too so that's yeah yeah yeah obviously I mean that's what I mean
00:48:05 like yeah yeah I think we agree on this pretty much yeah like like take take take take those things
00:48:09 into account but you always gotta put yourself first I totally agree okay all right then then
00:48:16 there's no need to argue any further uh well all right I feel like I got like three topics in this
00:48:22 time so who else who's that something to break I have something to talk about okay uh it's the
00:48:29 fact that I'm dead like hypocrites dead and he's been killed and he's never making a video game
00:48:34 reviews on the ground what uh canonically what's hypocrite doing right now what's the hippo he's mad
00:48:41 that I quit the show and he's writing his own reviews but they will never be published because
00:48:45 I deactivated no I banned him from using the computer yes he has to he has to ask me to use
00:48:53 the computer and I was like no how are you such a monster that you just made yourself the villain
00:48:59 of this tale I'm definitely the Maddox in in the in the breakup of me oh yeah well yeah I mean
00:49:08 let's talk about it so so it specifically what you've decided to do as I understand it um is like
00:49:14 the the game reviews specifically you don't feel are working out the way you wanted them to so you
00:49:18 want to direct your energies elsewhere right it yeah I mean I I framed it like that because it was on
00:49:23 that channel but like what what it really is is like the idea of like making a career on youtube
00:49:31 yeah has always been the thing that is it's you know the most stressful and the most difficult
00:49:37 thing and youtube used to be about just having fun and putting stuff on the internet to make people
00:49:42 laugh once money came into it money sort of you know owns your mind and then everything that isn't
00:49:49 making money is like oh that's a waste of time I didn't make money off of that when before it wouldn't
00:49:54 have mattered so much so like I've what I've done is that it's not just I'm not I'm stopping game
00:50:00 reviews is that I'm stopping youtube being my career as an end goal like if like if I ever make youtube
00:50:07 videos again they would not be for the purposes of building uh you know any sort of youtube presence
00:50:14 up and if it does happen it happens accidentally what about uh you talked about still doing I
00:50:19 think animations would those be posted to youtube in some capacity uh yeah because it's just an easy
00:50:24 way to put things on on the internet like youtube is a very handy platform but like as a career
00:50:29 opportunity like that's gone like I'm never gonna think of it as a career thing ever again
00:50:33 because it's just not worth it even if it gets better it's never gonna be perfect
00:50:37 oh and never gonna be good enough I think you know this is this is very interesting to have somebody
00:50:42 one of us uh adopt this opinion because the thing is I think it's a completely reasonable
00:50:48 and just grounded thing to recognize if you're just not obtaining the success or wealth or whatever
00:50:54 like at a certain point you gotta be like like I mean look at me I've decided I decided a long
00:50:58 time ago that I wasn't doing well enough on youtube to just do it so I like hopefully one day I'll be
00:51:03 able to uh and I'm working towards it but like yeah uh I want the fans of wanting I like I don't
00:51:09 actually want to have youtube as my career but I like uploading stuff on youtube and if it makes me
00:51:15 a little bit of money for like once every five months I don't mind yeah it's fine that's like I
00:51:21 think it's it's really just like I used to enjoy the video game review things because I watched AVGN
00:51:26 and I just wanted to do that and then I learned over time that youtube can be a career and like
00:51:31 jontron was making money and I was hearing about that on game grumps and I was learning about how
00:51:36 let's plays make so much money and then once that's in your brain every time a new fad comes in or
00:51:43 like a new billionaire youtuber or like a vine star like makes so much money you're thinking
00:51:47 oh if only I was doing that which is kind of easy like you know I just I just need to be doing that
00:51:53 and I can get so much money and it sort of muddies your intentions like the only reason I got on the
00:51:58 platform was not to make money it was to make stuff that I liked and the the two of them became
00:52:04 intertwined and like video game reviews became synonymous with money and because they weren't
00:52:08 making money they became depressing I know what you mean that's that is how it works do you know
00:52:13 for sure it's it's a shitty fucking feeling like there's like there's like a an area where like okay
00:52:21 if you're not making enough money to even have it be like anything then you probably like work a job
00:52:26 or like you do whatever else you need to make money and then you do the youtube like as for fun
00:52:30 and that has however successful it is and I feel a lot of people can do really well like in that
00:52:35 space then there there's the tier of like struggling to make it where you like try to make it a thing
00:52:42 that's kind of where I'm at where I'm like trying to get ahead trying to you know push ahead and
00:52:46 make enough money so it can be your thing but there's going to be tension there and temptation
00:52:50 about like selling out to make more money so you're making it and then there's that and then
00:52:54 eventually you can get past that like wave crest or whatever and you're in the land of you just
00:53:00 make enough money up top where you kind of have another freedom that you obtain and you can kind
00:53:05 of do whatever you want but even when you're there you have the constant fear that you'll lose right
00:53:10 there's no security on youtube like it can be gone at any moment like and then the people can turn
00:53:15 on you the algorithm can change you can't build up a safety net on youtube it's like every day
00:53:22 you're one bad word away from being dead I mean it's getting more like that all the time and I
00:53:27 feel like like this three tier it's kind of like a not really a class system because it's not like a
00:53:31 hierarchy it's just like I feel like like somebody who comes to mind is like mr meddaker is a guy who
00:53:37 like has a full-time job is a popular youtuber or you know internet aristocrat as it used to be known
00:53:42 like he isn't that first camp um in that he doesn't depend on it to like make a living and stuff at
00:53:48 least I don't think so he's like uh he's like uh deleted his accounts and like slashed and burned
00:53:53 and like yeah because they get too big before he wants that freedom so like that you can feel
00:53:58 about him however you want but like it's interesting to note how because he's never depended on it
00:54:03 you can you there's a sense of authenticity about his work I mean he just doesn't give a
00:54:08 shit about whatever his whole his whole his whole platform is like to point out how absurd
00:54:14 this entire like thing is yeah but and then like uh I mean that's absolutely true and then you when
00:54:20 you move up then there's other people and like it's sort of like you can feel the authenticity
00:54:25 kind of dissipate as it be like when when money comes into it and like you've know like hey man
00:54:30 I've got like a wife and kids I'm a youtuber I have to feed them I'll do whatever it takes
00:54:35 to get enough money to like feed my family this month or whatever you get guys like
00:54:39 not to shit on the guy or I mean he didn't do very good things but like Monday and Matt for example
00:54:43 is exactly the first person I thought of oh yeah he kind of like he's a full-time youtuber he got
00:54:48 some success he has a wife and a kid and he got into this thing and I mean whatever his whole
00:54:53 thing about claiming people's videos or whatever it doesn't matter the point is he like you could
00:54:56 feel kind of him tailoring himself and designing himself to be able to survive on YouTube and
00:55:02 don't get wrong I'm like this too with like we are going shit so I'm definitely in this camp as well
00:55:06 to a degree um and then like I don't know guys like James Rolf just like they've made and they're
00:55:11 in the clear basically yeah I mean what seems at least the thing is like you have to get to the
00:55:15 point where your brand self-perpetuates it's it's up you're no longer dependent on YouTube's mechanisms
00:55:21 like when you're in that like second rung you have to play the game because you have to build up
00:55:26 momentum you no longer have to I mean if I I'll bring I'll leave an example and I don't mean to
00:55:31 shit on the guy uh but Psy Psy is like that like he succeeded by the YouTube algorithm but it didn't
00:55:37 he he didn't have like a like a dedicated audience that was like I'm sure he'd agree with that
00:55:42 willing to I mean to a certain extent he did but like not to the extent that you would think like
00:55:46 like you know a lot of his videos went really viral and stuff and probably made a decent amount
00:55:50 of ad rev but then like when he tried to transition into other things like it just didn't carry over
00:55:56 for whatever for whatever reason yeah because it was all it was he succeeded on the algorithm
00:56:01 right it was the force the other that's true for him it was like if YouTube if YouTube just
00:56:05 dissipated then then it all it all went up in smoke and it's such like a uh it's like it's such a
00:56:10 double-edged sword succeeding on the algorithm because you don't even really have any control over
00:56:14 it you can't yeah because you because nobody knows what it actually is like we can make assumptions
00:56:18 but like if you get into the algorithm you don't really you can't pinpoint how you got there and
00:56:22 you can't continue that wave it just kind of starts and stops and then you're just like okay
00:56:27 uh shit you just have to trial and error it yeah I mean that's true and I guys like Matt Pat
00:56:33 early pioneers and stuff and I can't remember who made this but like somebody made a video recently
00:56:38 about how like uh yeah like like PewDiePie would never have gotten to the places out if you started
00:56:43 today just like making the content he does yeah right in a wave basically it's really fucking
00:56:48 emplemin I think that's exactly right it was emplemin and by the way not and I think I need to
00:56:52 finish that was that was pretty interesting uh none of this to say that I'm at all happy that
00:56:58 like hypocrite videos have like gone away obviously I think I'm probably one of the biggest fans of
00:57:03 the hypocrite stuff but uh yeah yeah I mean you know like I'm also a big believer in facing reality
00:57:09 and making important decisions that are tough when you feel that way and like I sure hope that
00:57:14 things change and you come back and make more great videos but yeah I mean I I hope I feel like
00:57:20 the the like sincere drive to make a game review again that's funny like like it was it was just
00:57:28 inspired by stuff I was looking at that I you know I admired AVGN it's like it was really funny
00:57:34 game review stuff and so I just wanted to create based on that and yeah like the money forces it
00:57:42 to become like a repetitive cycle it's true and it's true I feel like if I if I have enough time
00:57:49 away I might feel a hankering for like actually doing it again but for the foreseeable future I
00:57:54 probably won't like it's yeah yeah it this reminds me it's just sort of gone this reminds me of
00:57:59 something really interesting I've been watching for the last couple days like I don't know if
00:58:02 anybody here knows Gary Vee Gary Vanderchuck sounds familiar he's like he's like a guy on YouTube he's
00:58:08 like a YouTube personality but he also runs like a 150 million dollar business called Vayner
00:58:13 Media's like a consulting business stuff he's like a business guy he's an entrepreneur and that's
00:58:16 like yeah about entrepreneurship and stuff and like it just like it reminds me that like you
00:58:22 have to love the game to be able to do this because like he just started a new series on his YouTube
00:58:26 channel called Trash Talk and what he does is that he has he's got like millions of followers
00:58:32 stuff he makes a fuck ton of money his company makes 150 million dollars but he loves the game
00:58:37 of just like making money so much that he just goes out to yard sales and flips things on the
00:58:44 weekends and I was documenting it so he's like you can watch his Twitter just like yeah just picks
00:58:48 up a 50 cent sold over 10 bucks fuck yeah and he's like super stoked about it because he's trying
00:58:52 to like teach people how to like make extra money and like you can do it on no budget but like he's
00:58:57 jones to go out and make ten dollars and like he loves business as a thing that much that even
00:59:03 though he has no reason to do this it's just the act of it and I feel like that's a thing with YouTube
00:59:08 is that like you have to love just like the act of being a YouTuber like if you have like if you're
00:59:13 using YouTube as like a means to have different end you're gonna sputter out eventually or it's
00:59:18 going to become mature so yeah like like you can love making YouTube videos but hate being a YouTuber
00:59:24 and hit a wall eventually yeah because so many things just have like a finite shelf life you know
00:59:30 you have an idea you make the idea but then like there's this if you've built up any traction
00:59:35 by getting that idea done there's this unspoken like obligation that it has to perpetuate into
00:59:40 infinity and then that's where the problems start yeah also like the the platform itself shifts as
00:59:49 you grow older like the the thing that you want it to be as as like it's changed and is no longer
00:59:55 what it used to be anymore like literally like I used to be like also like I was inspired by
01:00:00 like the nostalgic critic and that guy with the glasses and all those like funny silly stupid
01:00:06 review shows and I wanted to be on the big collective the the big like every so often
01:00:14 like movies they would make where they flew everyone out to one place and they did stupid
01:00:18 video game movie cliche trash and I just wanted you want to be on channel awesome I wanted yeah I
01:00:25 wanted that um like like a lot of people did I mean I was a little I was a little boy and it was
01:00:29 just like really cool to see a crossover of of things like I didn't really care about all of them
01:00:35 but it was just it was just cool I just I want to be in a community I want to be part of a thing yeah
01:00:40 and so when I was a little kid I really wanted to be a reviewer for Game and Former magazine
01:00:47 I wanted to write I wanted to write for EGM really bad I loved that magazine a lot yeah
01:00:52 and and and it's just like you grow up and you realize that those reviews are generally bad
01:00:57 and it would be really stupid to have gone to that thing like I was too young to go to one of those
01:01:02 yeah um but like if I like if I had the clout now at age 25 would I go like would I be like I
01:01:11 probably wouldn't like even disregarding like scandals and stuff that has happened well I mean
01:01:16 those things kind of seem to me like like rad con but less cool and also more polished I guess
01:01:22 it's just like your your tastes change so like if you desire to be a thing
01:01:27 are based on like a childish impulse and you start that as your youtube channel and you get
01:01:32 into that and then you grow older and you don't want to do it anymore but now that you're you're
01:01:36 stuck in a cycle where people expected of you and it's all I've I've thought once in a while about
01:01:41 like will I still care to review like anime and video games when I'm like 40 I mean I don't know
01:01:48 I have no idea probably but who could say who could say you got to think about what were you
01:01:54 going to go from there folks we have a like the main thing is like like like think of what you're
01:01:59 doing and if the money was gone would you continue it assuming that you could get the money in some
01:02:05 other way right right because like to take money out of the equation would you still be doing this
01:02:11 thing see that's exactly why I think about like uh like your like the animation you did for endless
01:02:16 war for the end of season one uh was just done out of love and was so great and everybody loved
01:02:22 it for that you know little community that is the rowdy fuckers cop killers yeah and uh it was
01:02:27 truly legendary piece and it came out of nowhere and I didn't expect anything like that to happen
01:02:32 and it was like one day you were just like hey so I made this thing and I watched it and it was
01:02:36 like the coolest thing ever it was unironically my favorite piece of media definitely from the last
01:02:42 several years uh yeah and it was absolutely incredible so like I hope to see more stuff like
01:02:47 that from you I mean not it doesn't have to be that maybe something that actually makes any money as
01:02:51 opposed to literally zero oh yeah by the way everyone go to Gibbon Fortress 2 and watch that
01:02:56 a million times yeah please do we got to link that to Gibbon Fortress 2 for sure you can you can also
01:03:00 see it on twitch.tv slash rowdy frickers cop killers I gotta say the way that it that that happened
01:03:06 during a stream in rowdy fuckers like that was the most that was absolutely incredible no nobody
01:03:14 even I barely saw it coming god it was so great guys way to go I think you didn't even tell me
01:03:19 you were making it until like that day yeah I was I was just like oh I had the perfect idea and I
01:03:25 made it as fast as I possibly could yeah it was great the chat went nuts the chat went nuts don't
01:03:34 you love people with big projects like that it's my favorite it's my favorite it's it's pretty cool
01:03:39 but like what I love the most is when I go completely insane fast editing recording like every time I
01:03:46 have like a funny stupid give and take vlog idea that is just one stupid joke and I was like oh I
01:03:51 gotta make this I make it in like 10 minutes yeah yeah yeah the best idea is that you just bang out
01:03:59 they always like those those moments of inspiration like when a dwarf in dwarf fortress gets a oh god
01:04:05 what do they call it a fey mood pickaxe yeah yeah a fey mood or a weird mood or whatever it is like
01:04:11 I'm surprised you knew that mate I actually been watching no no I've been watching a person
01:04:16 played dwarf fortress with my boyfriend it's like fun stories yeah that's dope that's awesome like
01:04:23 that's where my like my my Ridley video and the subsequent okay like the Ridley one I was just
01:04:28 possessed with a ravenous inferno of inspiration to make a celebratory video about uh like the
01:04:36 inclusion of Ridley into smash bros at long last and luckily for me it's also like the most literally
01:04:41 the most popular game series except maybe for pokemon uh so people were interested and I like Ridley
01:04:47 because he's purple how basic of you who could have care so so so gib like what's your new focus
01:04:55 where what are you what are you working on primarily now well I'm I'm working right now I'm finishing
01:05:01 my comic bail jpe yes uh so definitely before the end of the year maybe even at the end of
01:05:08 october I don't know but I'm working hard on that oh shit and then I have like a lot of ideas for like
01:05:15 like I've had this idea generally for like doing music review not music videos um to
01:05:25 license music that will get copyright struck and like like a demonetize like uh in my head I'm
01:05:31 listening to it and it's like this is a perfect song I don't care if I don't get money I'm just
01:05:35 going to call it you know unmonetizable music video that's how I feel about my and then do that do a
01:05:41 bunch of those and just be like I don't know guys dance into it so is there well yeah I mean cool
01:05:48 dude I I want to see him also I also have like plans to make like adventure time but with my
01:05:54 characters instead because I love adventure time just make adventure time but with me and hippo
01:06:01 you fame oh actually I want to ask you about this you famously rewatched all the adventure time
01:06:05 recently famously you're renowned for this don't don't talk about the finale because I'm on season
01:06:09 10 and I'm almost at the finale okay I won't talk about anything specific but I love the whole
01:06:14 show it's perfect you said Gibb that there was one bad episode uh to for to your estimation
01:06:21 and I want to ask I forget what that was and I maybe that I assume that it was correct one
01:06:25 ends it was season four episode three or four the spiders having marital problems that sounds
01:06:33 like a stuck in a web and they don't really do I remember that episode now I actually did see
01:06:37 that one okay but I wanted to bring up the worst episode I saw that made me quit the show was when
01:06:42 they brought back party god who was like in love with an island or something oh that was so weak
01:06:46 did you what did you think of that episode game I was really curious um the episode itself is fine
01:06:51 it's just where the party god is the guy that they use party god it has no relevance to anything
01:06:57 else party god is like hawn's mole man you don't want to know like what's going on with him behind
01:07:03 the scenes not to mention there's there's vast different continuities for the origin of hawn's
01:07:07 mole man that all conflict with each other and that's exactly how I like it thank you very much
01:07:11 I I like I rewatched the simpsons like a year a few years ago like the whole thing well there's
01:07:18 like there's like a thousand seasons well I watched like the first like 12 seasons or something like
01:07:22 it was a big marathon yeah um okay but like I didn't even realize that his his joke is that he dies
01:07:28 every time like he dies over and over more less yeah he's coming back I terrible things happen so
01:07:33 I may have mentioned that I watched this uh the simpsons simpsons tuber on youtube called the
01:07:38 real gyms who does uh he does a bunch of different simpsons related content but in
01:07:43 particular he does simpsons histories where he goes into like the whole timeline of like a character
01:07:49 and simpsons miss you you know them I love them I've seen a few I love the I love the real gyms
01:07:55 he did a simpsons histories about hawn's mole man oh good and uh there's cannot be like 35 or
01:08:00 something right well it depends because yeah the one in that in that like AA meeting he says like
01:08:06 I'm 35 years old uh but then in in a in a later episode he was actually like like 50 years ago
01:08:14 he was mayor of Springfield yeah because like he's in old homes for old folks homes sometimes and
01:08:20 it's it's yeah it conflicts and like I don't know it was interesting because like apparently his
01:08:25 early appearances he's like he's usually driving and he's usually interacting with patty and selma
01:08:30 and these are like the two things that are consistent in his like the first couple seasons
01:08:35 that he starts appearing fascinating fascinating yeah because he can't see he's like he's like yes
01:08:39 the old man because his glasses are so but he was probably introduced as a joke of like he's the old
01:08:43 man driving who like I don't know they'd fuck with or something well also in in an old tracy
01:08:49 omen short there is an old man in a movie theater who is questionably hawn's mole man he sort of
01:08:56 bears a slight resemblance to hawn's mole man okay it's probably based on him I bet there's
01:08:59 literally like a hawn's mole man episode uh because it's gone there is not that's so weird
01:09:05 there is not there is not a hawn's mole man spotlight episode did you say your sister's
01:09:09 husband's name is is hawn's no no I said I said it's so weird that his name is hawn's why why is
01:09:17 that weird I don't know it's just I never realized he had a name and now his name is hawn's isn't that
01:09:21 like some miscellaneous european name it's it's I think it's German oh yeah right hawn's well all
01:09:29 right he's probably actually a nazi I bet there's an episode about that uh because you know Germans
01:09:35 they're all bad um yeah he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't die in us with Abe Simpson he doesn't
01:09:41 die in a star as burns the one with the man getting hit by football that's good he should be the
01:09:46 star he should be celebrating it's gonna he's gonna go hit by football yeah a fate worse than death
01:09:52 uh hey we're winding down what do you say we get to the voicemails let's let's go yeah yeah yeah
01:09:56 let's do it up all right oh wait wait I got one more I got one more thing to talk about I got one more
01:10:00 life update oh whoa hey we were gonna get pumpkins later me and michelle what do you know hello what
01:10:08 happened to your voice I suddenly had a house and money for a second there was crazy how many
01:10:16 you think it's a fool's game Tom it's a fool's game what what's that Ben I said having a house
01:10:22 and money is a fool's game oh yeah uh hey how many pumpkins you think are going to be carved this
01:10:26 halloween to look like pump would you say all of them prop hopefully all of them and you have to buy
01:10:33 a funny jack o lantern face too so yeah you know nobody it's like hiding your power level but with
01:10:40 jack o lantern carving pumpkin so good I did carve a couple years ago I did carve some
01:10:47 problem sleuth pumpkins don't I'll do something I kind of want to carve a pumpkin someday saw my
01:10:53 bucket list uh fuck them oh it was uh I hate that shit it's dumb it's gay I love it it's it's like
01:11:00 it's like um it's like building something but you're destroying something instead when mom was
01:11:05 driving out here you know it's almost halloween and stuff she she stopped at like a halloween
01:11:10 pumpkin display thing and like they had the most she took pictures that she showed me the most
01:11:15 insane pictures of carved pumpkins I'm gonna see if I can get one for her to put on screen here
01:11:19 but it was like there was one for example that was uh it was like a tiger but the thing is they had
01:11:25 like shaved parts oh I hate that so like there were various lane it wasn't just like cutouts it was
01:11:31 yeah fucking you know what I mean like it was glowing at various degrees at various points like
01:11:35 based on how thick or thin the skin was yeah yeah there were other ones I I I hate those so much
01:11:42 why why are they try hard the no well in one way yes they are try hard but like it sort of
01:11:49 goes against the whole idea of it being a fucking carved fruit like like no it doesn't it's fine
01:11:55 I don't know they're still carving the fruit it's it's technically impressive I just don't
01:12:00 like it makes for a good image on your Instagram but doesn't make for a good fucking pumpkin you
01:12:04 want something to scare the kids outside well sure I don't like I don't like halloween but I guess
01:12:08 I guess carving pumpkins is the only is kind of an okay part of it because it's kind of creative
01:12:13 and it's kind of cool and it's not the not the getting sweets part I like that's a good part
01:12:18 that's not keto I never actually that's not keto halloween is not keto that's not keto at all
01:12:24 at all arguably the least keto holiday I get the children chocolate dipped potatoes
01:12:43 I kind of thought halloween had become an international thing during halloween
01:12:47 you know they run movies and there's like oh you know they sell candy and stuff like that but I
01:12:52 don't think anyone actually goes trick-or-treating or whatnot so it's sort of like an acknowledged
01:12:56 holiday but no one really you know does that thing people in the UK do celebrate it yeah but
01:13:03 obviously not as much as America we do I like I never really got into the whole trick-or-treating
01:13:09 that much I did it a couple times with my my brothers and we would just go around the neighborhood
01:13:14 but when I got into a teenager phase like other teenage teenagers and stuff they would go like
01:13:20 you know let's go around and and egg people's houses and do stuff that's on the simpsons and
01:13:24 like yeah that's yeah and then and then they were the young adults and let's like let's go get drunk
01:13:30 and do the same thing we did and I'm like I don't want to dress up anymore it's stupid I think like
01:13:35 I love the halloween version of halloween I went trick-or-treating twice but they weren't
01:13:41 too successful over times like the first time one of my friends was in the UK or in or in Latvia
01:13:48 or Lithuania oh I know I know you're Lithuanian I just fucked up it's okay it's okay in the first
01:13:54 time my friend's bag of candy was stolen by like teenage boys and I ran after them but I couldn't
01:14:01 keep up damn that sucks yeah and the the second time a lot of people just didn't open their doors
01:14:08 because they were rude wait was this in the UK no Lithuania yeah I you gotta go to like a good
01:14:14 neighborhood like there's the neighborhoods where like families live with lots of little kids
01:14:18 generally in America yeah well pretty good you know that was my neighborhood and you know my
01:14:22 neighborhood so yeah bombed out uh I just this whole conversation just tells me thinking about
01:14:28 how great America is for creating halloween and I'm picturing you know that picture of uh okay so
01:14:36 there's a picture of a fat wojak face fat feels guy face wearing an american flag and crying
01:14:42 shirt that says you will always be a mera fat but there's a variant of that that's which is coming
01:14:48 to mind which is it's super buff super swole a smug ass wojak uh wearing american flag boxers I think
01:14:57 and there's a noose around his neck but he's he's breaking the noose and it says you will always be
01:15:02 a mera fat um so it says the same thing but uh he's winning anyway his name is wojak yeah he's
01:15:09 he's made by this polish guy named wojak you're talking about feels guy yeah yeah I I did not
01:15:16 realize wojak is not realize he had a name I feel bad even calling him wojak it like that is
01:15:21 kind of one of his you guys are experiencing what made just I I only know him as feels guy
01:15:26 well okay that's perfectly acceptable but is that why they called bojack crossman bojack well maybe
01:15:31 he has a lot of feels a lot yeah maybe do that I wouldn't be shocked uh but do you have a life
01:15:38 update or should we go to the questions uh my life update is just yeah since I've been sick I may
01:15:42 have mentioned this before but it's getting sick I broke keto so that I could chug cough syrup and
01:15:47 get and get high on that lean um is that break keto cough syrup it's the sugar in it there's sugar
01:15:54 in it I mean I could have I was just like I'm gonna be eating cough drops and drinking cough syrup
01:15:59 so I'm just like can I get the bear cough syrup please yeah so I just uh so I just I haven't been
01:16:05 I was ready to chastise you hardcore but that barely counts in my in my well no no no it's because
01:16:10 like I was drinking the cough syrup but I have also just been eating carbs normally because I was
01:16:14 like I fuck it oh too bad okay guys yeah but I'll get back I'll get back on it I gained I gained a
01:16:22 couple pounds in water weight and I'm very I'm very you know it's very very distressing so you know
01:16:27 distressing um I since we were talking about Halloween I actually looked up of maybe buying
01:16:33 like candy corn online and like the thing is yeah the thing is I love candy corn nobody likes
01:16:39 candy corn I am candy corn is good advocate I hear people like the either love it or hate it
01:16:46 there's no in between I haven't heard a person say I was like oh they're kind of okay you might
01:16:50 like them but I don't or something like that I haven't I like them people that say that they're
01:16:55 people that say that they're bad and compare them to the sweethearts are criminals what is that a
01:17:00 real thing there's like a people are like oh candy corns grows oh it's just some chalky shit like
01:17:05 sweethearts oh my god sweethearts are literally in sweethearts aren't even food yeah they're disgusting
01:17:11 they taste like medicines yeah but yeah but like candy corn looks like soft cough syrup is literally
01:17:17 tastier than it is sweethearts and also it gets you high as well the good news mage is that people
01:17:23 have been harassing us for some people were telling us that we should send you candy corn I was like
01:17:28 she's a big girl she can get her own damn candy corn but at least the bullying will end now if you
01:17:32 seal this deal hopefully I get to decide if I want to because it's expensive and there's a lot and
01:17:38 what if I don't like it I don't want to just throw away like 15 quid worth of candy cord which is like
01:17:42 300 15 quid like it's it's it's costly to get it he it's to get it shipped here at least on amazon
01:17:49 from what I've looked it's 15 quid that's like four thousand dollars
01:17:52 he's just in line with a couple people maybe I'm a couple people I don't have friends Nate
01:17:57 what about a gay boyfriend uh I don't know you got your topa you've got your head mates you know
01:18:03 you've got a whole squad why don't you send your cat out to get some for ya that is important
01:18:08 send your send your cat out to get some have she's got a polar way the only thing my cat brings back
01:18:13 is rats wait what would you say geb I'm looking at amazon.com for candy corn little bag of candy
01:18:20 corn it's like six pounds it's half off that's good that's good oh right now wait put it on your
01:18:26 amazon wishlist all right I want to have like an amazon affiliate link in the description so you
01:18:32 can buy candy corn from the UK there's speaking of candy corn candy corn right now is teaching me
01:18:37 self-control because six quid for 300 grams that is madness it's a bit it's a bit shit but yeah
01:18:44 did you and me put out a whole big thing of candy corn and it's just sitting there and
01:18:49 I don't know if I said it on the pzp but Ben Ben inspired me to go keto so now I've been keto for
01:18:53 a week and I can't have it and it's very difficult but I'm learning to like consciously control
01:18:59 because like when I go out and buy food from like the store I have to like consciously make the
01:19:03 decision but with candy corn I could just grab it without thinking and I haven't fucked up yet
01:19:07 but it's there constantly tempting me I don't understand like a lot of people do this and I
01:19:12 don't get it people that like have like candy bowls out and I don't understand how people don't just
01:19:17 eat at all my work my workplace has a candy bowl with like just tons of fun-sized candies I'm
01:19:23 I'm eating that shit every day yeah it's not like when I'm around it's pointless yeah I don't
01:19:30 have no semblance of portion control like whatever the package is is a portion to me
01:19:35 yeah yeah yeah I know people that leave food I might have I think I got mad about this on the last
01:19:40 one people that leave food unfinished I don't understand people that leave that is more than
01:19:44 don't fit people that like will leave like a quarter of a sandwich unfinished and like put it in the
01:19:48 fridge for later that is a constant thing that happens in this house and I don't get it there's
01:19:52 happy and food everywhere I don't I don't get people that like don't finish their food when
01:19:58 you're full you stop yeah that's so rare no you stuff your face until it's done if you put a
01:20:05 personal pan pizza in front of me I will eat it and be satisfied if you put an extra large pizza
01:20:10 in front of me I will eat it and be sick but also satisfied I'll be full and I was like but I'm not
01:20:15 gonna not finish this pizza right there is there is some there is some hefty psychology um which is
01:20:21 what I'm gonna call it that uh seeing a plate uh like cleaned or food is like yeah incredibly
01:20:28 satisfying to some people and others not but like if you give like children like a big old
01:20:35 bucket of spaghetti they will eat as much as the of that as they possibly can but if you give them
01:20:40 like a small plate they will eat it and they will be just well they'll be happier I think you don't
01:20:45 feel like they got shortchanged right exactly it's all about the packaging like if the if the
01:20:50 large pizza came in two pizza boxes and you ate a whole box you'd probably be all right
01:20:55 yeah maybe I mean I love saving food for later and I yay I get to enjoy the rest of my food later
01:21:00 I'm happy about I mean I have leftovers I love I love having leftovers but I never but I rarely
01:21:06 do because I'm just so compelled there won't be any leftover if you're once you're done with that
01:21:10 yeah yeah I used to when I was a kid psychologically to just torture myself like whenever I didn't
01:21:16 finish my food I think I think about like but there's people out there who are hungry how can I
01:21:22 waste this food and it's like I did this when I was a little kid and I always finished my food
01:21:25 because of it because I felt guilty about wasting food I just get a job starving children this ain't
01:21:31 my problem and then I go about my day throwing my pizza in the trash all nine tenths of it
01:21:38 like I got I got so upset when I went to college and I had a friend like and for the friend like
01:21:43 the mom would pack her a lunch and she would like usually not eat it and just throw it away not even
01:21:47 touching it was like but why just take it home just poor plan just take it home the weird thing that's
01:21:53 me is like like there are like stores that will throw out their extra food at the end of the day
01:21:58 and not yeah it's like they can't resell it and then apparently like you know people like people
01:22:02 who need food will come and like take it and like there are stores now that will like dump bleach on
01:22:06 their leftovers so no one could eat it okay why why there is a reason to do that sort of thing
01:22:12 and it's that okay the market demand that they're satisfying is hunger they want to keep hunger there
01:22:19 so they can sell you food and if they just give away food then there goes their market so that's
01:22:25 some fucked up capitalism doesn't work shit right there kind of yes kind of I uh I um you know one
01:22:32 thing yes I've been off keto so I've finally been able to eat some of those pastries that my
01:22:36 housemate brings home from his uh job at the pastry shop uh not not too great I feel like I'm
01:22:42 gonna talk to you about this last week like that I had like I had a pastry and like they're never
01:22:46 as good yeah they're just not as good decreased or something right or they're just like they're fine
01:22:51 but they're like why was like why was I craving these so bad like they're just whatever they're
01:22:55 just food do you think you're gonna have to like ease your way back in to keto again or do you
01:23:00 think like you're just gonna be able to flip the switch instantly and just get back I think it'll
01:23:03 be a I think it'll be a little bit of a challenge now that I'm out of it to shift gears back in but
01:23:08 you know I did it once I can do it again it's entering so far it's been surprisingly not as
01:23:12 hard as I expected yeah it wasn't as hard as I thought like you can eat you can eat to satisfaction
01:23:18 you can eat like you can eat a whole bunch of shit you can eat like a lot and like be full on
01:23:24 keto and it's fine I want to see uh I want to see a superpowered keto individual fight the vegan
01:23:30 superpowers and uh somebody on twitter the ultimate fight it was a while ago someone tweeted
01:23:36 I'm sorry I can't remember who it was because it was a while ago but someone made tweeted at me with
01:23:41 like a write-up for like a keto superhero it was a guy he would no it was like a guy he was like
01:23:47 he had two forms he had his his he was normal he was a really buff guy but he was just a normal
01:23:53 buff guy with no superpowers his superpowered form was that he would become really fat
01:23:58 but he would be keto but what in his super fat form he was fueled by his fat and therefore had
01:24:03 super keto powers okay it makes sense isn't that like it's an actual character in my hero academia
01:24:08 like he his fat gives him powers I forget his name I think I think you're thinking of choji
01:24:13 from Naruto no there is a guy in my hero academia but yeah there is a superhero and like as he uses
01:24:18 his power he gets skinnier because his fat gives him his powers yeah that happened didn't that happen
01:24:22 to choji didn't choji literally like burn off his fat long yep in his first and only good fight
01:24:27 in the series fucking keto um all right let's go to the voice shall we go to shall we go to
01:24:32 voice yeah let's do it let's do it yep all right here we go um we got we got on deck okay we're
01:24:39 checking in with uh wolf spar wolf spar wolf spar wolf spar what one is this one is this one spar
01:24:47 okay I mean how is a Halloween themed perhaps it's been a transformation let's let's find out uh
01:24:53 what do you got for us buddy all right as of this recording it is october 14th and as you
01:25:00 no doubt remember I said earlier that october 15th is the official end date for the bounty
01:25:05 and I'm pleased to announce that it was a huge failure yeah no time stamps in the document
01:25:12 and uh the chances of the conspiracy ever being proven are between slim and none but hey there's
01:25:17 good news sorry about that you see after last week when I got my legs broken by those guys I got
01:25:22 by wolves but I managed to befriend them and now I live in a wolf den and I have a wolf family I
01:25:27 even got asked a wolf yeah the thing I was wearing this fursuit the whole time and asked for what
01:25:31 will happen to me well I was able to pay off the wolf mafia for protection so I don't think I have
01:25:36 to worry about the starfleet guys anymore so yeah I think I'm just gonna let the bounty die uh to
01:25:41 heck with this to heck with you guys uh I have a better family now uh wolf family I have my very
01:25:47 own tree in the yard I marked it it's mine now no one else can go here so you stay the heck away
01:25:51 from it uh goodbye you know congratulations once you know you know you know you know wolf spar yeah
01:25:57 the newly dubbed wolf spar you can't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you just
01:26:02 might find you get what you need like a wolf family yeah this is guy saying lyrics yeah yeah yeah
01:26:09 I'm a musical I'm a music man an end to this thing I don't even know kind of what the point
01:26:14 of all this was no I don't know where this was going um but I'm glad like a huge ass from the
01:26:20 beginning so this was just him like finding a way to come out as a furry I didn't explain why he had
01:26:28 that fursuit from the beginning I feel like the point of this was that his his bounty idea completely
01:26:33 failed and he needed to narrow but he needed to narratively justify it with the humorous conclusion
01:26:39 so he let us on a wild goose chase culminating in a wolf in a wolf in a wolf happy ending also
01:26:45 he's like we were we all were richer for it I wasn't aware of this link to a document that he like
01:26:50 wanted updated with timestamps anyway so like maybe if he'd given us that information uh we could
01:26:55 have helped him out maybe if only if only we had uh helped him out with that he would be he would still
01:27:00 be among humans true his own kind well he's fucked now but that's just a sale he's a total
01:27:05 romulus remiskay right now that's that's true uh so okay so here's one here's one from food boy
01:27:11 there's another message from him gross what we're past that but let's see what he's got
01:27:17 hey hear that sweet sizzling sound yeah of course you don't because you're weak weak of body from
01:27:24 a shit you're consuming and weak of mind there's not a single one of you managed to present a
01:27:28 non-retarded opinion food so lonely a venerated mealmaker to set the record and all of you faggots
01:27:35 straight the soulless process of assembling a hello fresh kid does not teach you and cannot be
01:27:41 considered cooking yeah understand what you're doing following orders like a fucking Nazi
01:27:50 switching out ingredients and methods of preparation and seeing what works it's a creative process as
01:27:56 opposed to the mindless adherence to dogma this mind washing service demands I agree I agree at least
01:28:03 you're eating real food when you're done good thing no one in the pcp proselytizes for going that
01:28:08 step wait fucking kill me all right um all right disagreed uh on all counts uh no he's on point he's
01:28:20 on point I'm I mean I'm not saying you can't you couldn't learn anything by cooking a hello fresh
01:28:26 meal I'm not saying it has no value the hell is hello fresh is it like hello kitty but different
01:28:32 we talked about last week if the service munchie has they deliver specifically the
01:28:36 ingredients you need to cook like one meal like oh terrible it's you know hello fresh is childish
01:28:43 hello fresh embarrassing is like a tutorial like you go online you're trying to learn like programming
01:28:47 or art or something and you follow the tutorial perfectly it's like oh I made this this little
01:28:51 baby thing but like it's not you would never like make a tutorial and be like oh I did it for real
01:28:56 like no that is like I guess that is like getting getting a lego kit building the lego kit and then
01:29:02 never ever experimenting with that lego yeah yeah a fair enough fair enough you people were
01:29:08 defending fluttershy when she was taking baby steps but it's not okay to get hello fucking fresh
01:29:14 fuck you all it is it is baby steps and uh and and it's it's training wheels and and if you just
01:29:21 really need to cook a nice meal right and you don't know what the fuck you're doing then yeah
01:29:25 you could maybe get some of this right the baby steps is you go to youtube or you go to google
01:29:29 you type in how to to cook x and then you find the ingredients list you go to the supermarket
01:29:35 you find what you can okay you're gonna save so much money in the long run if you just go buy
01:29:40 fucking groceries yeah you'll save money but what if I just want to save time by having them give me
01:29:46 literally everything I need and I can just cook that I think in the long run buying in bulk will
01:29:52 save you both but I don't want to think about it I just want other people to do the thinking for me
01:29:58 it's like not thinking about it it will result in you in the lifelong dependence of you right
01:30:03 subscribe if you don't want to think about it then why you want to learn how to cook like you're
01:30:07 clearly not interested in it okay you know what the longer the longer you the longer you go without
01:30:13 thinking about it the longer you are you're siphoning money off to these fucking millennials running this
01:30:18 bullshit millennial company you're not wrong as much as much as it sucks to burn a meal or to not
01:30:24 know what you're doing that those are like important formative steps to being a chef is to like okay
01:30:30 so if I if I put garlic in with the oil uh too early then it gets black before I put the other
01:30:36 stuff in so I got you know it's just like things you you learn that apply to loads of different
01:30:42 types of cooking and different meals that's true like you need to learn basics through trial and
01:30:47 error or like you know like you can use youtube tutorials and I guess hello fresh is fine once
01:30:52 or twice but you should never have it as like the be all and all I don't I don't think it's I don't
01:30:58 think it's worthless but I don't think it's worth much is I guess that's fair enough I kind of want
01:31:04 to try it though just for a time I don't know maybe I won't end up doing it by the way this talk of
01:31:08 millennial bullshit just reminded me of uh uh yesterday hello fresh is quintessential millennial
01:31:15 bullshit what characterizes to me what characterizes millennial bullshit is a desire to like fake
01:31:24 creativity and individuality and hello fresh embodies this idea that you have a shortcut
01:31:30 that you have this like shortcut that you can pay for to like fake a to like fake a creative skill
01:31:36 I guess that's true I guess that's kind of it's it's it's like buying a ready meal but you know it
01:31:41 it's it's it's the selling beads on Etsy of cooking it's I did speaking of ready meals like like
01:31:49 we had like a person knock on our door which is weird how did he get in because we have like the
01:31:54 um we live in a flat and you know like the it was like not the outside it was the inside door so
01:31:59 that was weird and he was like so he knocked on a door and he was offering like some sort of service
01:32:04 of gusto I think.co.uk and it's it's like you order a meal specifically like a meal on their
01:32:12 site and they make it for you and then they deliver it which is kind of like takeout but you know
01:32:16 their meals are like not like pizzas and burgers they're actually kind of cool yeah I was like oh
01:32:23 that's kind of neat I might I might try that and that sounds like the sort of uh thing they have in
01:32:28 old people's homes that they deliver it does but I like those I like those a lot I yeah I'm not
01:32:34 saying that that is like is a bad thing it's like yeah you know fair enough by the way you you want
01:32:38 to order a roast dinner it's a way it's a way it's a way to try out all these new different recipes
01:32:44 of foods and stuff speaking of this millennial bullshit though that I was mentioning uh when me
01:32:49 and my mom went out to this place Finley Market you know whatever it's a nice place around in
01:32:52 Cincinnati highly recommended uh but like have you guys been aware I don't know how many of you
01:32:57 guys live in cities but like there's been these these things I've seen around of just like people
01:33:03 using these scooters they're just using scooters and then you'll just see them on the side of the
01:33:07 road this is like in the like not the inner city but like in the city there's like urban centers
01:33:13 you'll see like there's just like green scooters three hours ago did I well I figured it out I
01:33:18 figured out what the issue was and I rode them and it was dope it's all right here's what it is
01:33:23 there's these two services called like a bird and lime and what they are are
01:33:29 they just leave scooters around the city and you can use the apps to GPS locate where they are
01:33:35 you go to them you scan them in your phone and then they activate they're all they're all electric
01:33:41 and then you can just scoot around on them like like an electric skateboard only you know a scooter
01:33:45 I've seen I've seen like I've seen like in Boston there's like bike racks with like bikes that I
01:33:51 similar to that yeah there's like and you like you can like rent a bike and like ride it between
01:33:55 like bike locations there's a bike rack like that around UC in Cincinnati as well it's just like
01:34:01 that it's called like blue something I want to the ones in UC are red everything in the city is
01:34:05 red because that's like the color but like the the thing about these is that you literally leave
01:34:09 them on the side of the road you just leave them there and you you say that you're done riding
01:34:14 after like 10 minutes right in the middle of the road well what stops someone from just taking
01:34:18 absolutely nothing except the fact that they're probably GPS tracked or something well I don't
01:34:22 know I'm probably also the the fact that they're electric and they won't like maybe the brakes are
01:34:27 on by default and you you can't like ride it around without yeah being activated but couldn't
01:34:31 you just like pick it up and toss it in your truck or something you you definitely could do that I
01:34:36 don't know exactly what stops them but it's gotta be something they must have a business model here
01:34:40 that if they're GPS track that they are yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe easy easy crime easy crime catch
01:34:46 it's pretty cool though and we rode them and they were fun and I liked it though I missed my skateboard
01:34:51 was it uh expensive uh no it was like it was like I don't know five bucks for me and my mom
01:34:57 both took a ride for like I don't know 20 minutes or something uh that's pretty good you know maybe
01:35:02 it was less I didn't actually check how much it costs now I think about it but it said like a minute
01:35:06 or like a dollar for like an hour or something I don't know I could be wrong but it was it was
01:35:11 cool I liked it I've never I've never seen scooters like that it was but it was I don't think we
01:35:16 have them around this is kind of like app-based activation city living things just such millennial
01:35:22 bullshit and I'll just have none of it thank you very much but that doesn't sound bad though
01:35:25 millennial bullshit is characterized by being bad I don't agree with that uh what's it called
01:35:32 what's called birds one's called mime they're two absolute the exact same thing
01:35:37 they're called scootaloons that's true all right let's move along we've got another
01:35:41 that would be a good epony for this blue bikes the thing is called blue bikes
01:35:46 metroboston's bike share program all right well it's uh it was the thing we've got around here
01:35:50 yeah all right here here's another one this one this one's called the dreamy or the dreamer army
01:35:56 anthem and I believe it's by center point let's it's it's 10 seconds long let's see what this is about
01:36:03 wait how long are you saying 10 seconds yeah
01:36:11 fucking it shit okay that that's all it is I think what this is is I think these are the
01:36:17 people that are very much hashtag let mage dream and this is their anthem I didn't think that's
01:36:22 a classic beat sequence is that the the segment intro I think yeah that's the intro oh guys you
01:36:29 know what this is actually a great idea um it'd been proposed that we should do this at some point
01:36:34 maybe this should be like a separate show or I guess it could be an episode but literally like
01:36:39 the dream cast and the here's what it here's the conceit of the show oh my god you play dream cast games
01:36:45 in uh like let's play format while discussing your dreams that's the that's the format oh wouldn't that
01:36:51 be sick isn't that dope I mean we have a dream yeah yeah I think that's not people suggest that that's
01:36:56 yeah we could do that for for heckles for shekels we should do that cast one of those heckles for
01:37:00 shekels dream cast um it's a good idea it's for for dreams and if you feel if you viewer if you
01:37:06 feel strongly uh that people should be allowed to dream or if you feel the opposite way that
01:37:11 dreams should be banished and abolished and punishable by death uh you got to get in the uh
01:37:17 procrastinators bonus lounge and to argue your point you got to get in there and be a soldier
01:37:22 yeah true for whatever side you uh you want yeah yeah yeah we need to there's the there's a civil
01:37:27 war there's a civil war breaking out the dreamers versus the memers and it's dreamers will dominate
01:37:34 dreams will be crushed uh memers for life your dreams are my memes uh right okay so there you go
01:37:42 you've got an anthem now fantastic congratulations um here's here's one here's a here's a here's a
01:37:47 thank you here's a cute little message from uh Nate Senpai please fuck me um all right okay
01:37:56 let's let's hear it let's hear your pitch this question goes out to Nate I was just wondering
01:38:01 if he could shove his big black juicy uh yeah all right that's not that um what do you think
01:38:11 what do you think Nate what's your uh you know what's your face will take it's quite a pitch
01:38:16 that's quite a pitch um I'm leaning a hard yes I'm gonna get back to you a little bit later on
01:38:21 that you have a special someone already well you know the space I'm a public figure age I have to
01:38:29 be used by my beloved public in all facets in all capacities uh here's another one from our old friend
01:38:36 sheet public use public Nate's public use now that's right I am the town bicycle public don't
01:38:41 what do you got for us buddy hey guys first of all thanks for the advice ban but I decided
01:38:48 I'm not gonna fast anymore this is the faster guy I am on an eight hour fast right now but it's only
01:38:53 because my mom's doing busy fucking her new boyfriend anyway you guys were talking about
01:38:58 your and if you didn't hear it from my accent already I'm from the Netherlands and there's
01:39:03 this something we do here in the Netherlands we speak Dutch so I was wondering how are you
01:39:09 guys with foreign languages do you speak any do you want to learn any is Esperanto cool or is the
01:39:15 meme it's a meme questions sorry about that okay bye yes I do speak a foreign language
01:39:21 Esperanto is a meme but as a memer I'm all about it I'd like Esperanto to replace all the languages
01:39:28 I think why not why not have a language that people already speak be the language that takes
01:39:34 over the world it's an ideal what is what is this what is Esperanto oh uh give Esperanto is a
01:39:40 it's not fictional but like it's a it's a one-man made a team made up a language that was supposed
01:39:45 to be like easy to use easy to learn it's like similar you know how it's around Star Wars there's
01:39:53 like basic where everybody in the fucking universe knows basic so they can communicate with each other
01:39:57 that's what Esperanto is but here in Star Trek Star Wars and Star Trek both have this I believe
01:40:03 yeah I think so and it's called basic in both I call common well I'm everything
01:40:07 that's indeed it's called out wait wait hold on Star Wars and Star Wars both have a common language
01:40:14 called basic I know it's called basic and Star Wars I don't know what's called the Star Trek
01:40:19 it is called galactic basic standard according to the wookiepedia let me see basic
01:40:24 language
01:40:28 it's brought up Klingon top 10 Star Trek languages to answer the question maybe Star Trek doesn't
01:40:34 have basic maybe yeah maybe it's just uh my my favorite foreign language wait it's not favorite
01:40:40 I'm not good at anything I can speak English but only bail federation standard there's a federation
01:40:45 standard language uh so there you go I studied Spanish I studied Spanish in high school and
01:40:53 through a bunch of college so for like six years or something I took Spanish class I was supposed
01:40:58 to be really good at it I did really well in Spanish class when I graduated college never used
01:41:03 it it's completely decayed I don't use it at all it was totally a waste of my time same with me in
01:41:07 German and then when I went to Poland I learned a couple of phrases because I wasn't interested
01:41:13 in learning another language for a country that I was probably never going to go back to right I
01:41:18 I learned a bit of German I know a bit of Russian by like cultural osmosis yeah yeah the
01:41:25 unfortunate thing about languages nowadays is that in order to learn a language you need to
01:41:30 really really really want to like I have like oh yeah wouldn't it be cool to have like no a language
01:41:36 but the only reason the only reason I would need to learn a language or like would would want to
01:41:41 learn a language is to impress other people with how many languages I learned this is and not because
01:41:46 I really want to go places and use it yeah I know because I don't need to everyone speaks English
01:41:51 well I mean I have a strong desire uh uh
01:41:54 my inichi nihongo de hanashitai no no no uh benkyoshitai every day I want to learn Japanese
01:42:01 because there's actually a real tangible benefit uh because not everything gets translated fast
01:42:06 you're a weeb enough for me I'm big enough into the weeb shit that learning Japanese would be
01:42:10 actually useful to me and so why don't you and did you gonna make your Japanese video series I mean
01:42:15 I've still got I'd love to do it now once we move and we're closer we should talk about that more
01:42:19 but like I think I'm learning Japanese I think I'm like I have an app I've been bad the last I
01:42:25 know a couple of weeks I want to be practicing Japanese every day on my little app what's called
01:42:29 it's called uh Memrise Memrise it's pretty good um we're like more like meme rise hey you're not
01:42:35 wrong it's accurate team memer for the win another point for us come on dreamers pick up a pace I
01:42:43 would like I would like to accidentally learn a language like Bart did in that episode of
01:42:49 Simpsons where we learned French just by being in France like that's how the most efficient and
01:42:54 best yeah it just clicked one day it just clicked and suddenly he could speak perfect French I always
01:42:58 do that like if I if I go to like Swahili or something I like I stay around there and I like
01:43:03 suddenly I'm speaking with everyone and I'm like you know I become a pirate 13 Swahili country uh
01:43:09 Swahili language I can't remember I don't think there's a place called the Swahili cut wait maybe
01:43:14 there is you know that episode of Simpsons where Bart learns French I always thought that you know
01:43:20 like he's talking like trying to get that Constable or whatever the the French police to like help him
01:43:23 with his whatever it is and uh like the Constable like gives him a big pink candy I always thought
01:43:30 that candy like somehow let him speak French suddenly like it was like a I really thought that
01:43:36 for a long time because it's like as soon as it gives him this very strange looking candy
01:43:41 he can suddenly speak French and I stand by it actually I still think that's what happened
01:43:46 now I want to go and re-watch that you see I would prefer to learn I prefer to learn a language
01:43:50 like in Dexter's laboratory when he has to study French for a French test and he only
01:43:54 learns omelette du fromage and all the girls are instantly wet for him and yeah yeah that's
01:44:00 that's the way to be yeah that's accurate but like it's it's it is like a better use of your
01:44:05 time to go to a country and just be an idiot for a while um living living among like real people
01:44:12 not in a tourist trap um and then you'll you know you go to the market and you say uh you know you
01:44:17 have the pocketbook of like basic phrases but then you'll learn more as people speak to you yeah
01:44:21 you gotta be like you gotta be like Jeff Ferrell the soccer guy you gotta go to Mexico City you
01:44:26 gotta go to all right Cuba and Canada you gotta go to the city center juggle your soccer ball
01:44:31 get called a gringo get them to take pictures of you uh decide no no teach teach random strangers
01:44:37 English even though they didn't ask you to come home come home and try to and decide that maybe
01:44:43 I'll become a Spanish teacher even though I barely learned any Spanish and my Spanish sucks damn
01:44:48 yeah that's a bold plan that's that's how that's how to live anyone could pull it off it's our boy
01:44:52 Greg um with Jeff Jeff right um yeah whatever it doesn't matter okay let's move on next call from
01:45:02 mr bones rattling them up lads let's see what we got I'd like to express my sincere appreciation
01:45:09 for munchie j trump and the way that he criticizes the other members of the pcp in a kind of playful
01:45:15 ribbing manner you know like the way he takes digs uh the kind of miniature cultur personality
01:45:21 surrounding Nate so I'd like to invite the rest of you to take a moment and give a small piece of
01:45:27 critique about another one of your fellow pcp members uh also mitian is gay fuck you
01:45:35 well fair enough uh I mean I do like that about munchie like when he sees something
01:45:42 that nobody's talking about and he will just say it because it's like it's funny to draw attention
01:45:46 yeah no it's good it's good uh a lot of the times people can be too worried about offending their
01:45:52 friends or something and I want to rock the boat yeah the thing the thing is with munchie that he
01:45:55 has that that that boyish charm that makes it like water for ducks back and we know we don't get angry
01:46:01 at him that's true even though we all agree he he he takes he can take the core gesture of the pcp
01:46:08 there's no he can he can take refuge in audacity you know what I'm saying you know what I mean by
01:46:13 that I know yeah he can compress those waveforms and it sounds fine no that's not because the court
01:46:19 jester uh traditionally could say things to the king that like if like a serious lawyer brought it
01:46:24 up he'd probably get fucking executed but the gesture can be like he's like he's he's like the pcp
01:46:30 the the contingent of like serious lawyers well you know discussion about as as clowns go he's more
01:46:35 like the evil kefka like whispering in our ear with his fork tongue just like telling us sweet
01:46:40 nothing's in like gradually turning us into who is that king in lord of the rings kefka kefka
01:46:45 didn't whisper in anyone's ear except when he was fucking sling their throat here who is who is the
01:46:49 guy in um in yeah worm tongue and lord of the rings yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's
01:46:55 true i'm confusing him with worm tail from her that's a named character i think if we're talking
01:47:00 about gentle ribbing uh i'd like to say munchie sucks and i think we all agree and that's you know
01:47:06 frankly all there is to be more specific you have to be specific otherwise it's just a gentle
01:47:11 let's let's see if we can think of some some some actual minor gentle ribbing criticisms um
01:47:16 i'll i mean i'll i'll come out sure you're pretty like munchie you're not afraid to stir the munchie
01:47:22 has i mean munchie has uh where's fuck where's fucking investigators yeah fair okay okay i know
01:47:30 i mean i will say that i know he has released some pages i don't know how many there's someone
01:47:35 his tumbler but he has not made it public at all and i interpret this gesture to mean that he
01:47:40 is not actually ready to have people see it probably because if he was he would say he would
01:47:44 announce it he's been very secretive about it they're up on his tumbler and i feel like he put
01:47:49 some out just sort of to like be like yeah yeah i put something out like i'm getting something done
01:47:54 but it's not ready and he like it needs to get ready it's still not ready fuck you
01:48:00 uh good i don't know what i should say but you know i'm guilty too i'm guilty of the same thing
01:48:06 with vapers three yeah where the fuck is vapers three it's coming a bunch of stuff but i mean i
01:48:12 mean that's fair you know i've been where i've been working on the max reviving tbap i've got a
01:48:17 while i was working on ten paces and draw for a while you have a whole list you have a whole
01:48:21 list of shit i i bang out a new page of vapers three whatever i get like a free day yeah yeah
01:48:27 i still like seeing vapers the the vapers on on my shelf next to like home stuck and problem
01:48:34 sleuth it's fun man when vapers three is done i'm so i'm so excited for the second kickstart i think
01:48:39 the second kickstarter will do even better than the first one probably because i'm gonna have bundles
01:48:43 i'm gonna offer bundles because i know a lot of people people sometimes ask me like hey where can i
01:48:48 buy the vapers out none of the kick starters over and i tell them hold on i'm not just selling it
01:48:53 like on a one-for-one basis i don't want to just like sell like sell just whenever just whenever
01:48:58 anyone happens to email me no they'll be like available for the second kickstarter and i feel
01:49:02 like there's a lot of people that miss the first kickstarter and will want to get in on the second
01:49:06 one along with all the third people that did get in on the first one that are gonna want to buy
01:49:10 volume two uh i'm really excited and uh i want to finish vapers three before before i run that
01:49:16 campaign though yeah anyway good that's that's uh that's sorry to derail about that yeah whatever
01:49:25 no past all right mr. bones there you go we discussed things nobody else nobody nobody else
01:49:30 you fucking cow i have i have a i have a gentle ribbing of of of nate uh you suck no uh you have
01:49:39 um a tendency yeah i mean i've told you this like in private so it's not even really a big deal but
01:49:44 you have a tendency to bring in like topics that are not real they're just like here's
01:49:49 something that happened today lol and then and you hope that that will like blossom into a big
01:49:54 discussion i mean it didn't happen this time so my because i thought it was really good give me
01:49:58 give me do you have do you have an example um the last time the skateboarding one is what we talked
01:50:05 about nate nate just brought up the fact that he was on a skateboard and he liked it and that was
01:50:10 topic that he brought forward cool that's yeah i mean i use you change it around for this one i will
01:50:16 agree there okay well that's but i have to rip someone i have to rip it somewhere i'm a little
01:50:19 fraught no that's fair that's fair it's true i guess we all gotta we all gotta make sure we
01:50:25 bring something actually good and not just more shit thing more more more ribs um tom someone killed
01:50:32 me someone killed me well hang on okay i got one for tom you can't do it i'm too powerful i don't
01:50:38 understand where your career is going tom and it confuses me and i i feel that what this really
01:50:44 indicates is is a lack of like uh communicating to your audience where you're like like are you
01:50:51 working on getting a game done right now or are you let me let me let me let me simultaneously
01:50:57 bolster that statement as well as pose a follow-up question um so you were talking before about
01:51:04 a game demo i don't know anything about the game you're making yeah i mean wait i i have
01:51:09 a sort of a sense that it is it's a side scrolling action platformer right correct i know that i i
01:51:14 think i know that much about it i've been i've released it of a devlog every day this month
01:51:18 there's 13 of them out yes the fact that we don't know that is a problem was it on maybe is it on
01:51:24 polystation uh it should be they're on youtube and they've been tweeting about them on twitter every
01:51:30 day and oh you know it starts with like they all so okay i guess this is on me then shit i have
01:51:36 seen those pcp uh like um feed for content like did you upload them all at once um first 13 i they
01:51:44 were originally private because i was doing them for patrons but i was like fuck that uh people
01:51:48 should see these okay so that was kind of a cared yeah so but for the last like five days they've
01:51:53 been up to public every day and there's another one coming out today those all appeared at once
01:51:57 and i was like well i don't really want to watch all of them i'd rather just see the finished product
01:52:01 or like see like here's my promo trailer like here's my game okay that's all fair here's here's
01:52:07 a thing give an elevator pitch for this game it's a side scholar in the style of a classic
01:52:13 sega game with more forgiving controls and expanded mechanics make it more appealing to
01:52:18 modern gaming tastes okay i mean maybe this is all way premature like like maybe you're
01:52:24 playing to get it out in like three years or something and i don't know i'd like that's
01:52:28 he said you said you were gonna put a demo out in like the next couple weeks right yeah i'm trying
01:52:32 to get some sort of like demo slash vertical slice in people's hands by november 8th because that's
01:52:37 when i'm gonna be an old man and i want to have something i'm semi-proud okay well i i guess my
01:52:42 question is so is this the main thrust of what you're working on um for right now but like okay the
01:52:49 whole idea is that like i want to have like kind of like the the assuming characters like a multimedia
01:52:54 project there's going to be like animations and motion comics and games and stuff but like the
01:52:58 game is just something like tangible and like meaty okay that i can get done and like have a
01:53:03 forearm 30 so that's what i want to work on right now you know that right there is interesting i feel
01:53:07 like this this concept of a multifaceted multimedia like character it like it confuses me like what
01:53:15 that's going to and i just think that as like a viewer i just like i'm left with nothing i can
01:53:20 grab onto except the game like the game obviously is the thing that you're talking about so maybe
01:53:24 i'm just talking out of my ass here i don't know what platform what platform what platform are you
01:53:29 building the game in uh it's uh construct three it's like a it's like a visual programming
01:53:35 sort of thing right now you'll be able to play it on your pc gaming system band that's yeah it'll it'll
01:53:41 be a very i don't know i knew it was going to be a pc game i mean like what engine like game
01:53:45 game maker yeah it's it's something like game maker essentially is what it is okay my playful rib
01:53:50 is i have no idea what the hell you're ever doing tom and now you're explaining it to me which is good
01:53:55 but now i'm wondering if maybe that's my fault maybe i just haven't been paying attention well
01:53:59 the audience could only blame itself so much for not right i did be in you know i did see uh i did
01:54:04 i did see you were uh the slime i did see you modeling that slime which was very pertinent to
01:54:09 my entry that is like i have a death animation for an hour it blows up into like a pile of slime
01:54:15 and it looks cool cool all right well okay well i will definitely go check this out now that i
01:54:18 understand more uh well this is good feedback i will try and be more blatantly obnoxious about
01:54:24 developments so people can actually see it i think what would be helpful for me like if i like if you
01:54:29 made a video that's like i'm making a game it's whatever azumi fucks everyone that's the name
01:54:35 guys come into your computer right now you like jack and your dick you like furries i'm your man i'm
01:54:41 tom oliver i am a furry uh you know something you want him to make a billy maze commercial
01:54:47 that would work i mean it would it would be pretty fun uh yeah well whatever okay i get the point
01:54:53 we're not we're not trying to fucking break the man's spine here more more more more more
01:54:58 more ribs i have a rib for all of us because i'm trying to think of one thing in particular
01:55:02 okay that that bugs me but we all do this we when it comes to the pcp we all suck at making
01:55:07 decisions we all sit here and discuss it for 10 hours and all the good things that have happened
01:55:11 to pcp lately it's just one of us just doing it and letting it be real like what uh the voicemails
01:55:16 i just did it and that happened and then that just happened like these were things no censor that
01:55:21 censor that that can't be on the episode put a beep over that no one can know no one can know
01:55:27 what is it okay uh it it matters to me it when when will they know uh soon okay i promise i promise
01:55:35 i guess i'd assume this would already been talked about on an episode because again this
01:55:40 just reinforces my point that it takes too long for the shit to happen okay no you tom you're total
01:55:45 i agree with you on a lot of this but the thing is uh like like that thing happened and i'm like
01:55:51 let's run with this and then people are like um actually i don't think that's where i think we
01:55:55 should like gib was doing this i don't actually think this is perfect like we want to change
01:55:59 something and you know what i actually agree on some of those points but that's where we hit
01:56:03 snacks you know with those sorts of uh the pcp is not a perfect production and it needs to just
01:56:08 be flawed and bullshit so it can actually get things done i you know i know it feels like
01:56:13 everything moves at a glacial pace but like i understand why like like when i when we get
01:56:18 into a meeting and we're talking like it's not like it's nonsense like that it makes sense why
01:56:24 there's like disagreements and we can't move forward yeah and those have to be resolved in some way
01:56:28 which they almost always can be if we meet and like people show up to the means which none of you
01:56:33 did except for munchy yesterday so you know well i was like was there a thing was there a thing to
01:56:38 be discussed at yesterday's meeting was there like a specific i mean there was at least one there was
01:56:42 actually this exact topic that we're censoring right now was the one i wanted to discuss with
01:56:46 everybody i am usually not abreast of what is going on that is why i usually just i just i just
01:56:54 just don't worry about meetings when i happen to be when i happen to be at my computer since we
01:56:59 can't actually talk about this since it's centered i'm going to dovetail this off into another targeted
01:57:03 rib digi i know you're not here but you can't fucking complain about things changing in the pcp
01:57:08 and being mad about it when you don't show up if you don't show up that is there yeah you can't
01:57:12 that's not yeah the thing is with digi he thinks the meetings are pointless for some reason uh but
01:57:18 then he doesn't they are the only thing that gets things moving and done basically uh well at least
01:57:24 like the bigger issues not not like like i'm just going to make the voicemails was great uh yeah i i
01:57:30 think well of course he would think that they're pointless because he doesn't come to them and
01:57:34 then there's things just happen without him thinking about him so to him it just seems like
01:57:38 things just happen on their own right but that but he expresses great disdain in these changes
01:57:43 and like says like in this upset that they're happening like well if you want to
01:57:47 make them not happen be there when the changes are happening i mean i just for example digi
01:57:52 i'm not trying to show you too hard but if you ever came in into the pcp discord like added everyone
01:57:57 and said hey guys like what are the relevant topics like i'm there all the time and i'm there to explain
01:58:04 everything that's going on digi you don't even need to do that you can just go up one flight of
01:58:08 stairs and be like hey tom what's going on that's that's true but i mean i don't know like i kind of
01:58:13 i kind of feel for digi only because like like because the pcb is set up to be like that you
01:58:18 don't have to worry about it unless you want to pretty much yeah like you know yeah i mean i'm fine
01:58:23 with him not participating as long as he doesn't then complain and bitch and moan which he has does
01:58:28 sometimes once in a while i don't know yeah i don't blame him that much it's not that big a deal
01:58:34 but i that's fair that's fair criticism of the guy um well the thing okay so gib uh i would have
01:58:42 criticized probably up to this point the fact that like i don't know exactly what your goals are
01:58:48 like i'm not sure you like you seem to have a feat in multiple worlds and you seem indecisive
01:58:52 but then you've just made a huge decisive step which i think is very good for you to do in in some
01:58:57 direction that you're confident so like that criticism is kind of curtailed by you doing yes
01:59:02 and taking those actions so dodged yeah so that's real i mean again i'm not happy at all that like
01:59:08 the hypocrite reviews won't be coming or at least not nearly as regularly if ever uh but like you
01:59:14 know facing reality making big decisions hard choices about how to handle your life mate here's
01:59:20 a fucking rib you're terrible at ribbing you're such a little skating yeah yeah yeah yeah these
01:59:25 are these are pussy that's you're you're right you can feel like you're reading you're reading some
01:59:30 little you're reading some little pussy some little pussy piglet pork ribs you gotta get the big
01:59:35 ass beef ribs you know i'm saying the table and it just there's there's no they are absolutely
01:59:40 both right now so you know well at least he's giving some uh let's give major rib all of us guys
01:59:48 how about a mage i don't understand uh how you make any money if you make any and this worries me
01:59:55 and i'm confused by it that's what i have to say to you friend what's your business model
02:00:01 i i do come i do i do come you know commissions that's what it is i yeah i didn't really post them
02:00:08 but yeah are those things that like can't be posted because they're like you know they're
02:00:13 four people so like they use them for projects and then they're up doing stuff some of them yeah
02:00:18 sometimes i just i'm just lazy mage is a prolific porn artist with commissions she just doesn't
02:00:23 want to ruin her innocent image on the piece she never talks about it her dark her her after dark
02:00:29 pain yeah uh shit what was i gonna say oh it's like um we like with some of the people that i work
02:00:36 with like who've made like music for me or something like i'll want to keep the thing a secret but
02:00:40 then like once the project that it's for comes out then like like then they're like allowed to like
02:00:45 retweet it or like make it public that they like did this work or something so like i don't know maybe
02:00:51 i don't know you know my criticisms i guess aren't even really that relevant you're just
02:00:56 kind of in a totally different world than me that i couldn't really follow even if i wanted to i mean
02:01:01 i could i guess but it would be who you talking to right now talking to mage i'm talking to mage
02:01:05 like the world of commissions is one i don't understand or you know yeah it's it's like uh i
02:01:11 don't i mean when you do a commission mage i'm curious do you post it on your like social media
02:01:16 and stuff do you post it like hey guys look what i did or do you just give it to the buyer and like
02:01:20 don't give it to the buyer and then i'm too lazy to post it most of the time well there you go dog
02:01:25 what's your future business plan how do you grow from here and get more money and you know build
02:01:31 that 401k i like doing commissions and i'm not short of them right now it's like i'm currently
02:01:37 i hate doing commission i like i'm i'm so envious of you for being able to do commissions i could
02:01:43 make so much more money if i just didn't hate doing other people's dirty work ha yeah yeah i used to
02:01:50 not like them back in the pony days because all of all i i had to do is draw ponies can you draw
02:01:55 my lc fucking twilight sparkle i mean like i like drawing ponies but it got really boring because
02:02:02 i had to draw like basically the same things in a way but now i get i'm getting varied requests
02:02:07 and i quite like that perfect perfect scam you just make a show accurate template
02:02:15 and then you just swap out assets on like the whoever's on top you swap out to be their oc and
02:02:21 the one on the bottom you swap out to be the main six of their choice makes sense and then you can
02:02:25 have uh yeah yeah you can have uh yeah yeah infinite infinite commissions available in a moment's
02:02:31 notice your character here whoa uh whoa that's a funny joke that should have been a real character
02:02:38 i get it i get it why is why are we not actually doing this makes so much money who says we're
02:02:44 oh we could we could have made money i don't know if we still we'd probably make something still
02:02:49 i mean furries are still evergreen right furries will never stop be cash cows yeah yeah yeah like
02:02:55 the the pony thing may be on the on the decline but furries are forever i mean the pony fans have
02:02:59 to go somewhere and where else what's more adjacent to pony than furry the only place for them to go
02:03:04 is patreon.com slash tbbvap that's the best bitch about ponies they all get they all get a migrate
02:03:11 from derpy borough to fur affinity probably true um all right that was a good healthy round of ribbing
02:03:18 going around um all right let's let's move on next up uh we got we got i think there's four more of
02:03:24 these um bongo fag let's see whoa play one for me champ i asked you pcp how can i go to a school
02:03:34 literally called friend school and at the same time feel like i have no friends because like i
02:03:41 talked to people at my school and even follow a couple of them on fucking instagram but they all
02:03:48 feel like ghosts they all feel unreal and transparent and i've considered the possibility
02:03:55 that perhaps i'm just too intelligent for all of them i'm just too woke for all the normies yeah
02:04:00 yeah yeah i was like i was saying gay ass podcast every week right this is what did it but i've also
02:04:06 thought that perhaps they're all intelligent too intelligent for me oh no that i'm just no that
02:04:12 can't be it he's breaking the condition please send help uh i i would say that like it sometimes it is
02:04:22 that you are like you know more intelligent in that you have deeper interests in stranger things
02:04:28 and that they can't understand you like stranger things so much more than everybody else it's just
02:04:32 a real yeah no oh yeah i hate that thing lol um um i i mean i don't believe i i know this guy was
02:04:41 memeing to a certain extent but i'm just gonna take his yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna engage with
02:04:45 his question yeah i'm gonna engage with his question on on literal terms um i don't really
02:04:51 believe in intelligence as like a metric like some people are just more or less like it's not that's
02:04:55 simple uh people just have people are on different wavelengths people's people's you know thoughts
02:05:02 occupy different uh different like different vectors right people think along different
02:05:07 vectors and trajectories and sometimes they either they either do or don't match up uh so i don't
02:05:13 really think yeah yeah i don't think that's such a thing as like being too smart or too dumb yeah
02:05:17 for for to engage with someone it's just do your thought patterns like are they are they compatible
02:05:23 with each other i basically agree with that um do they map to one another yeah oh yeah like i
02:05:29 this reminds me of like the comic the xkcd of all the people in the train all having the same
02:05:34 thought of uh all these people are just sheep only i am like the true deep one uh but i know i know
02:05:40 that you're kind of joking they're they're all just unthinking you know like what i would say is
02:05:44 that like they're all just i think most people come across just inherently as more like like if you
02:05:50 don't know someone and then they just say a sentence you could like be like wow this is what this person
02:05:56 thinks and nothing else how embarrassing that's simple meanwhile yeah you know like they probably
02:06:02 have a lot more going on they have they have their own internal life that is not being shown to you
02:06:07 just like you have that's not being shown yeah and also also there's always there's always the
02:06:12 possibility that one of them who is engaging in normie topics or whatever um is doing so because
02:06:18 they have nerdy topics but the normie ones are the only way they can make friends so like yeah if you
02:06:23 just say out loud like i love anime like a couple people like oh the guy loves anime i love anime
02:06:29 would perk up at that or something you know but not that that's necessarily the best way to do it
02:06:33 but the point oh it is the best way to do it because it's very funny walk into walk in a class this is
02:06:38 what these are for walk in a class wearing one of those big t-shirts that have all the um all the
02:06:43 shit what's it called the the like orgasming girl faces on it you know just like all over
02:06:47 hey go from hentai hey go what are those called you know a ha ha hey go a hego faces i've been
02:06:53 saying can you hear me or what sorry maybe it was low jeez i said it like three times i had going
02:06:58 this whole time okay so walk in a walk in a class uh no we'd be wearing a hoodie all right be wearing
02:07:03 a hoodie and then this is like that scene in american history x where the guy walks into the
02:07:08 the courtyard he takes off his shirt and there's a big nazi sign on it you'll be doing similarly
02:07:13 only you take off your hoodie and you've got this shirt covered in a hego faces and everyone will
02:07:17 be like it's it's putting up a flag dude you're making friends instantly by making this alternatively
02:07:22 you could buy a pcp shirt on red bubble and get the same effect this is okay unironically this is
02:07:28 kind of why i wore so many anime shirts uh like my whole life because i'm i'm putting up flags to see
02:07:34 who wants to talk to me about anime guys please someone do it yeah this is like a real psychological
02:07:39 thing like this is what people do they look for like i have like a waking up podcast shirt like
02:07:44 why do i wear that uh one because i like sam harris and i'm happy to like you know supply
02:07:49 with money and shit for his shirt but also because like i would sure like it if other people who like
02:07:54 the same thing i like come up to me and talk to me about it uh you know that's why everybody needs to
02:07:58 go to i am games and i am games t-shirt we have we have multiple designs now if you if you want to
02:08:04 rep your doomer pride get a doomer t-shirt we also have a new shirt based on an old digi video
02:08:10 of a pixelated ken of uh of uh of mountain dew ice also i am a fucking alicorn princess you know
02:08:18 that is we should put that on that on there for posterity's sake you should yeah yeah yeah
02:08:24 no this new shirt's great because it's just a pixelated can of of uh mountain dew ice and
02:08:28 then under just says it's a sprite because you know it's a sprite is like my favorite videos
02:08:33 did you made well we have a shirt for it now and it's a sprite of a can so it's a double meaning
02:08:38 it's i haven't seen it i haven't seen it's a sprite google did you know is that like the pipe
02:08:42 watch that video it's like a minute long it's great i highly recommend it's a good video it's
02:08:46 like 24 seconds i watched it again a few days ago it's i really love that video i got it i gotta
02:08:51 get that boy 24 seconds of ad revenue but just to the guy's point like obviously we're i'm not
02:08:58 saying wear on an anime shirt like so you can talk to other anime fans like solve your problems
02:09:02 but like you you probably got to break through some people's barriers to like actually get to
02:09:07 know who they really are like so i don't know work on just like talking to people and not being
02:09:11 weird and creepy and join join a fucking club or something be a social extracurricular activities
02:09:17 are a good way he's right yes because like when you're in school everyone's like in zombie mode
02:09:21 you gotta like get there yeah you're gonna have you're gonna have you're gonna have superficial
02:09:25 interactions and like following following people on instagram is another superficial
02:09:30 interaction you've got to engage with people on a deeper level and an extracurricular activity
02:09:35 is probably a good way to get something like that good idea it's a damn good idea yeah all right
02:09:40 well there you go uh moving on guys guys what do you do when you leave school there are no extracurricular
02:09:46 activities they're recorded that's what i want to know www.meetup.com there's um i got that app but
02:09:53 none of it's tender tender um i actually i was looking into this when i moved to Cincinnati a
02:09:59 little while ago and like i joined excuse me i still get messages even though i want them to all go
02:10:03 away there's just like it's like meetup.com and then you can just like people have clubs around
02:10:08 they put them up there you just like go and you know there's people doing fun things you can go
02:10:12 hang out with them and i would love to go to a game dip. I uh unironically enjoyed a bunch of like uh
02:10:18 like Ohio free thinkers which is like the atheist group because i really i really like the fucking
02:10:25 uh what is it called uh it's not the wake of the podcast there's there's this podcast out of Austin
02:10:30 with Matt Dillahunty that i can't remember the name of that i've always wanted to be on oh the
02:10:34 atheist experience and i wanted to be in a group like that of just super intellectual gods who know
02:10:40 that god is just a fucking joke but you are you're in the pcp uh what you're right sometimes i need
02:10:48 a bit more sick all right post christianity podcast exactly okay we got we got another one here from
02:10:55 puny philosophy i don't know what that means i think there's that indian for vagina uh whatever
02:11:01 no that's yoni okay i believe hey guys i see you're looking for the multiculturalism well here i am
02:11:07 all the way from india yeah i hope it was all that you hoped for but uh get to my point uh can you
02:11:12 guys please get digi to never talk about nihilism or subjectivity ever again yeah yes it's all an
02:11:18 interesting position every dumb philosophy undergrad has to be weaned off of this everything is subjective
02:11:24 nonsense this is really good also read a fucking book digi
02:11:30 he should probably read a book you know what i mean indian comrades what a great what a great rib
02:11:35 from from uh yeah that was a fully fully bone fully boned rib on that one uh yeah so the thing
02:11:42 about digi's nihilism thing is that he's not incorrect but like you can go a lot further like
02:11:50 like i feel that i have gone a few steps further i recognize that there truly is no subjective
02:11:55 reality but we can if you want we just make some assumptions and i'll listen what sorry what if you
02:12:02 want peak nihilism you go to the amazing atheist youtube channel that's the biggest nihilist of
02:12:08 all times am i am i right is this is this money did digi like go to like one semester of college
02:12:16 take like i think it took like one philosophy class and like dropped out before it was finished i mean
02:12:21 i or something like that i think there was something along those lines i don't know i'm not trying to
02:12:25 rag i mean i actually i remember his mom was doing photography uh i remember his mom was doing
02:12:31 photography yeah he went like with his mom that photography is not philosophy give well they sound
02:12:36 yeah they're so similar are you sure they're not the same uh anyway okay good good good good philosophy
02:12:42 is just photography but for the mind you take pictures of that's my subjective opinion yeah and
02:12:47 you can't disprove it um so you know there there it is okay all right next mail uh here we go this
02:12:54 way we've got uh three more you know if did you know if did you would show up to episodes more often
02:12:57 we wouldn't trash myself from these vicious riddles um we've got one this is from a discount
02:13:04 lacroix shoe is the name of this individual let's yeah oh it's this sound gum shoe oh yeah you're
02:13:10 right here you go right like oh oh you hear that you fucking boomer i do it's sparkling water

02:13:42 fucking sucrose on the synapses what's it feel like boomers
02:13:53 wait it was like he was like the final boss the final boss of the podcast was discount
02:13:58 gum shoe drinking lacroix and challenging us to stop him and we can't we can't do a damn thing
02:14:08 megalovania the background i like that but there was there wasn't enough slurping yeah
02:14:13 it wasn't enough loud gulping and slurping noises we had we hadn't started the battle yet that was
02:14:17 just the uh the pre the pre pre battled calm before the storm yeah i think he's right uh well
02:14:24 that was powerful um moving on uh quick hard uh left turn to starving and tired uh with this next
02:14:32 message do it piano man
02:14:39 okay i just want to say i am very disappointed that the podcast was late this week oh yeah i'm
02:14:45 sitting here on a god damn friday waiting waiting for the good news to come to me and my brothers
02:14:53 you fool but lo and behold it is not here my friends for we have to wait wait until our
02:15:00 seven shitty overlords decide to get off their ass press a fucking button
02:15:07 watch the there was a shekels for heckles going on just you just want just tide yourself over with
02:15:14 the shekels for heckles that was happening as you made this all right but that was some hardcore
02:15:19 ribbing to ben for sure yeah well deserved all right yeah that sigh at the beginning was truly
02:15:26 earth shattering um the weight of his mistake was instantly known to bet he the sin i'm really
02:15:33 feeling the sins crawling on my back right now speaking of which um our last voicemail is from
02:15:39 better ben better ben impossible let's see uh end us on a strong note
02:15:47 bad things are about this is known
02:15:52 fucking okay so my rabbit died and that really sucked it made me really depressed
02:15:58 then the same fucking day i got stood up on a date and then the hypocrite channel the hypocrite
02:16:05 channel is gone yeah that's sad but not that sad because reviews are fucking gay
02:16:11 reviews are so gay and stupid and no one should do that
02:16:14 fucking end uh look yeah they're bad they're so bad and they're so terrible sounds like he's not
02:16:22 that sad about it actually yeah about that i agree i guess he's comforting himself with this thought
02:16:28 bad things happen yeah but some of those bad things weren't that bad and yeah i think it's
02:16:33 i think it's just sour grapes talking i think now now that he can't have it he has to say
02:16:37 ugh reviews are stupid anyway hypocrite was dumb didn't even want it
02:16:47 maybe this guy's just also named ben but he thinks he's better yeah that's my guess that's my guess
02:16:52 well he's wrong he's wrong of course well i need some proof before uh extraordinary claims require
02:16:59 extraordinary evidence as they say that's true that's true yeah exactly yeah well uh i guess that's
