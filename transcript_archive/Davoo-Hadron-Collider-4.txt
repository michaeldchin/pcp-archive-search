00:00:00 One bag of green tea and one bag of perfect peach tea.
00:00:18 I got one on Twitter criticizing my choice of tea brands.
00:00:22 I was using a Bigelow brand of tea and some others, but he said, oh, you should get this
00:00:28 very patrician tea, so I'll have to go and look up what he said again, and buy that brand
00:00:36 even though it's more expensive.
00:00:37 He said, that's better.
00:00:38 I'll try it out, you know.
00:00:40 And tea.
00:00:41 I don't know if my voice sounds different right now, but I'm sick at the moment, but
00:00:46 I want that.
00:00:47 It's that certain phase of sickness where you just feel really relaxed, if you know what
00:00:53 I mean?
00:00:54 Like, it was all tumultuous and tepid, what is it, it just felt like a tsunami inside
00:01:01 of me yesterday, and then I was super relieved once I finally got to my bed and just laid
00:01:06 down.
00:01:07 And this morning, it's like a kind of sickness phase where everything feels like really relaxed
00:01:13 and good in a way, and my voice, which was a sore throat yesterday, so it sucked talking.
00:01:19 Now it's just like reverberation in my voice, like I can really feel and hear like my sound
00:01:27 waves in my own body for some reason, and it's got like this warbliness to it because
00:01:33 of all the mucus and stuff.
00:01:35 So right now it's actually really fun to talk, so I decided to do this, the only downside
00:01:41 of recording something in this current state is that I'm coughing a lot.
00:01:46 But I'll have to see if I can edit all those coughs out, here we go.
00:01:51 Was there a cough, or did I immediately begin the next sentence?
00:01:54 Because if it's the latter, then that means I competently edited this.
00:01:58 But yeah, I gotta keep drinking this tea.
00:02:02 Now, I'm pretty sure that my voice is just gonna sound annoying to people, whereas to
00:02:09 me it sounds fun to talk, but I'm in my own head, literally, so it sounds fun from my
00:02:16 perspective.
00:02:17 It's probably just annoying and nasally.
00:02:19 But you know, hey, at least I'm finally recording another one of these episodes, when I said
00:02:24 I was gonna do them every two weeks, it's probably been like a month and a half now.
00:02:28 Thing is though, I actually had recorded an episode of this well on time, like within
00:02:33 a week after doing the last one, but I didn't want to release it, and over the course of
00:02:37 the next couple of weeks I did like two more.
00:02:40 A lot of it was like me trying to reiterate what I did in the first one, since I didn't
00:02:43 want to release the first one, but I ended up recording like three whole episodes, not
00:02:48 releasing any of them, because I'm kind of like, I'm now at the point of being known
00:02:58 on the internet to the degree to where I have fans now, and viewers now, where anything
00:03:03 I say will become part of this narrative that people are constructing in their heads about
00:03:07 me and the rest of the PCP, because when you're a fan of something, you learn all the
00:03:13 details and like you construct like a wiki in your own head about it, and there is indeed
00:03:17 an actual PCP wiki being made at the moment, and it's like weird because it's not how you
00:03:24 interact with other people, it's like you go on Discord, you talk to like the viewers
00:03:28 of the PCP and they'll talk to you and talk about you in a way that's very different
00:03:33 than how you talk to like a friend.
00:03:37 A friend knows things about you, but then like when they explain you to other people
00:03:43 or like ask you to elaborate on something you said before, they like, how do I say this?
00:03:49 It's like they're always interpreting you, if you know what I mean, like you'll say
00:03:53 something to a friend and they'll get something slightly different out of it than what you
00:03:58 said, like I don't know, the point is when it's like a viewer of yours who just sees
00:04:04 you as like a cool content creator, I feel like they sort of like take what you say
00:04:11 word for word in a way, like when you say something about yourself, they take it like
00:04:16 it's this sort of like fact, like it's this sort of, I don't want to use the word objective,
00:04:21 it's just like, they take what you're saying like it is like this structured thing, like
00:04:27 there's this physical detail that is what it is, and then they just sort of pile that
00:04:34 on to the other facts that they know about you, and when they explain you to someone
00:04:38 else, they'll like explain it sort of like word for word, very similarly to how you explained
00:04:43 it to them or how you explained it in a podcast, they explain you the way they would explain
00:04:49 allure in a video game or something, and you know, that's fine, it's just weird at first
00:04:55 because I'm not used to that, and it means that you know, I need to like change the way
00:04:59 that I explain myself to people, you know, like, I mean, you know, fuck, these people
00:05:05 give me money, and also give me viewership and attention, and it means I can post anything
00:05:10 I want on Twitter, and someone's gonna like like it or respond to it, so it's perfectly
00:05:14 well worth it, I'm not saying it makes me uncomfortable, I'm just saying it would make
00:05:20 me uncomfortable if I shared the wrong information or said it the wrong way, and then people
00:05:25 sort of understood things weirdly, so yeah, I'm definitely not as just like freely open
00:05:32 with shit as like Digi is, you know, where it's like Digi will just like mention his
00:05:36 mom and his dad, you know, maybe even drop their names sometimes, show their pictures
00:05:40 on screen, you know, I don't know, I'm not as open about things as he is, but that's
00:05:47 fine, you know, the point is that's why I was like hesitant to make an episode of this
00:05:52 show for a while because I just didn't think of anything I wanted to talk about that wasn't
00:05:57 just a bunch of like deeply personal shiz, but now I just went on like a one week sort
00:06:03 of vacation, yeah, a vacation, me going to see my new girlfriend thing, I was calling
00:06:11 her my squiggle in the first couple episodes because I didn't want to like, I don't know,
00:06:15 it's again trying to be like secretive with information, but at some point it's like,
00:06:20 no, I don't give a shit, you know, but the point is, I had a lot of like things happen
00:06:26 or things I thought about because I was in a different environment, so I, you know, was
00:06:31 self reflecting in different ways. So on the plane ride back, I wrote like a whole bunch
00:06:35 of notes for things I want to talk about on this show. So here we go. So, you know, the
00:06:41 first day I was there, we like went because like we just had like a little like hotel
00:06:46 room for us since like she doesn't have any space in her house. So, you know, we just
00:06:50 ran out like a hotel and I guess it's more like a motel. The point is, you know, it's
00:06:55 like this little cheap kind of dingy place. And we went to Walmart and we bought like some
00:06:59 food and we bought some like paper plates and like plastic forks. And I believe we cooked.
00:07:06 What was the thing we ate on the first? Oh, yeah, we just ate like a like a frozen dinner,
00:07:11 Alfredo stoffers type of thing. And we shared that. And it was like, as I was doing all this,
00:07:17 I was like, man, this feels really like ghetto, poor white trash. But I'm like really excited
00:07:25 about all of this stuff. And I was telling her, you know, as as we were munching down on the
00:07:30 Alfredo, that all of these cheap, shitty amenities really excite me all the time. Even when I
00:07:39 think about them, but particularly when I have them, like like like on the plane when, you know,
00:07:46 in coach, the flight attendants will come by be like, Hey, do you want to drink? And I'll say,
00:07:49 yeah, I want some spray because my stomach's killing me. I want some Sprite. So she's like,
00:07:53 okay, she pulls out a little tiny miniscule plastic cup and pulls out a can of Sprite and pours it
00:08:00 in there with some ice. And I'm like, I get so excited about how minimalist and cheap it is.
00:08:06 Because it's like not in a saving money sort of way. But in a, it makes me and what I was telling
00:08:11 my girl is that it makes me reflect on it makes me think about how advanced our society is that
00:08:19 that with no money at all with with so little money, you have things that are this good, you know,
00:08:25 used to be if you were like quote unquote minimum wage equivalent in say the 1920s, you'd be like
00:08:32 whatever you'd be eating would have all sorts of terrible germs and probably some bug wings
00:08:36 inside of it, you know, that kind of thing. Like, it makes me so excited that we have all this
00:08:41 technology that can can make something that's so cheap and yet is so competent and functional,
00:08:46 like a Stofer's meal, you know, like we have all these preservatives that make for more efficient
00:08:51 transit. And we have, you know, freezing technology, that's like a recent invention that
00:08:55 allows it to stay fresh longer. And we have microwave technology that she didn't get invented
00:09:00 until the 80s, by the way, I didn't know that. But like, did you was like, Hey, did you know that
00:09:04 you know that like, microwaves didn't exist until the early 80s. And I was like, wait,
00:09:08 what? And he was like, yeah, I asked my parents. And I was like, well, I'll ask my parents. And
00:09:11 they said, yeah, and I was like, wow, the 80s. So me and her wouldn't have been able to have this meal
00:09:17 even 30 years ago, right? And like plastic forks and plastic plates, it's like, they're so cheap
00:09:23 and yet so effective. And when I think about the rest of time, the rest of human civilization
00:09:29 throughout history and most other places in the world, even today, the fact that we have so much
00:09:35 stuff for so little money makes me so hyped about like our economy and our civilization. And I was
00:09:42 just like, it makes me so excited. It just makes me go like, yeah. And she was like, how are you not
00:09:49 an optimist when you think like that? Because like, because she like, she says like, I'm an optimist
00:09:53 and stuff. And you're all like you and your friends, you and your PCP friends are all like
00:09:57 cynics, you're all like cynical and pessimistic. And I'm like, and that was a good question.
00:10:03 Like, I don't identify as an optimist, really. I was thinking about it. And the conclusion that came
00:10:10 to you is that I don't need optimism to be in a good mood. Like the thing is, is that I'm pessimistic
00:10:17 and cynical about like people in general, like, like any person, if I don't know you as a person,
00:10:24 then I'm just going to assume you're like terrible at things and you're going to fail and that you
00:10:28 aren't going to be smart, you know. And you know, I know plenty of people personally who I just don't
00:10:34 like think are like that good at anything. And therefore you're like, yeah, you're kind of
00:10:39 not you're not you're not useful, you know. But then like me myself, I value myself immensely,
00:10:47 like I think of myself as really competent. And I think that I myself can survive and be good.
00:10:53 And then I know all these people around me who I surround myself with,
00:10:57 who I also think are really good. So I think of like really good people as like a minority,
00:11:02 but that I, that I can work with that, like the amount of good people that there are,
00:11:07 I can associate myself with them and then things can be good, you know, I guess, I guess that's what
00:11:13 I think. I don't surround myself with people who I think are shitty, you know, I win when some group
00:11:19 or some entity or some association starts to piss me off. I disassociate myself with it. I don't
00:11:25 want to deal with that. I only surround myself with people that are good. People that aren't annoying.
00:11:30 So many times on the internet, I'll have like, like on Twitter, you know, there'll be people
00:11:34 like Jesse, especially who will complain about what shitty annoying people are saying on Twitter.
00:11:39 And I'm like, I don't follow shitty annoying people on Twitter. I unfollow them if they get
00:11:43 annoying or shitty. But Jesse, like, you know, I guess he's just sort of like a born cleanup crew
00:11:50 for human civilization. He can't help but surround himself with all this filth, this human trash,
00:11:57 and he just has to rage against it constantly. Like he's definitely that kind of person.
00:12:03 I don't want to deal with that. I don't want to try and fix the world, try to fix stupid people.
00:12:07 So I'm just over here only being with good people. Oh man, okay. I'm realizing my head is pretty
00:12:13 stuffy right now. I am like talking very circularly, saying um a lot, repeating my words a lot to try
00:12:22 and finish my sentences. I'm definitely not very coherent, especially after like a week. You know,
00:12:28 my head is just kind of out of it. But you know, oh well, at least it's content. Feeling like doing
00:12:34 some content. Okay, um, oh yeah, you know, like, I guess part of why I'm why I think so positively
00:12:41 about cheap amenities is that like, like when I got interested in economics a couple years ago,
00:12:47 like when I read when I listened to the audiobook of Basic Economics by Thomas Soule,
00:12:51 and I was all like, dude, this book is super cool. And it talks about like, you know, just how
00:12:57 just how fragile and special our current modern economy is, like it really goes against the
00:13:04 tide of what human civilization is by default. And yet at the same time, if you just have the
00:13:10 right kind of society that values, you know, personal freedom and like personal property
00:13:16 and respect towards one another and trust in one another, then wealth sort of just happens,
00:13:22 you know, like if you have a society that's that's safe and trusting and free and individuals can
00:13:30 keep what they have and earn what they and earn what they have, people just sort of become great,
00:13:37 like society can become great if you're if you're a morally good society, whatever morally good
00:13:42 means this week. And yet it's just not normal, like that takes a lot of effort to happen. But
00:13:47 when it happens, it happens really fucking well. And like, I believe Basic Economics goes into like
00:13:53 one little historical thing that happened in the late 80s, I believe, maybe the early 80s. And I've
00:13:59 heard a number of like people talk about it on YouTube and stuff that there were some USSR
00:14:05 officials who took their first visit to America. And the moment that like really like blew them away
00:14:14 was when they went into a grocery store in Texas, you know, they'd seen all the statues and shiz,
00:14:20 they'd seen all like the crazy buildings that we've built when I'm sure they have crazy buildings
00:14:24 too. So they were like, yeah, whatever, you know, but when they saw a grocery store,
00:14:30 just a normal ass grocery store, they were blown away. And like one of them said that like that
00:14:36 was the moment where like my my last vestige of faith in communism went away, or at least our
00:14:43 country specifically, because they were like, dude, like in our country, people they have to
00:14:48 line up for hours just to get some shitty bread, you know, like like the amount of stuff in this
00:14:54 store beats what our highest ranking officials and our highest elites have access to. And it's so
00:15:00 cheap. And it's so neatly arranged. It's so well lit. It's so colorful. There's so much of it.
00:15:06 Every shelf is filled with the stuff. And it's so much variety. And it's so normal. All these people
00:15:13 are just walking in, not feeling special at all. This is this is accessible to normal frigging
00:15:19 people in this country. Anyone can walk in and pretty much anyone could afford a meal from this.
00:15:25 And they could get a meal of pretty much anything they want.
00:15:28 You know, I guess I'm just always thinking about the other dimensions beyond me, you know, I try to
00:15:33 like to think about things from other people's perspectives. So when I see a thing that it
00:15:38 like cost a little bit of money, I think about how much value would be to have to be to someone to
00:15:42 like, who is from Africa and shiz, you know, shiz, I keep saying shiz today. And I also,
00:15:50 whenever I see something with technology, I think I specifically think George Washington being with
00:15:56 me and me showing it off to him being like, dude, George Washington, this whole, this whole like
00:16:00 freedom constitution thing, you helped create, you know, this country of America, United States
00:16:06 of America. We did all this, we made, you know, with the help of some other countries here and
00:16:12 there, we made all this like cool stuff. And we have all this technology and, you know, be like,
00:16:17 I want to know what your reaction would be, you know, like, I'd love to see the, I always think
00:16:20 about the reaction that someone from 100 years ago would think if they saw it. And then 250
00:16:25 years ago, we'd think if they saw it, but most likely George Washington, that's the main one,
00:16:29 who I'd want to show stuff. You know, imagine just like you have George Washington, you know,
00:16:34 it's a comedy family friendly movie where he gets sucked into the future into 2017. And, you know,
00:16:40 you have to like, you got to go to like a coals and be like, have a montage of like getting them
00:16:45 out of all those robes and putting them in like a, you know, like a t-shirt with a jacket. Guy
00:16:49 to like, you know, just take off the dang wig, just going to go bald today, man, you know, go to
00:16:54 the dentist, get some like actual teeth, get some dentures and shiz, you know, and be like,
00:17:00 yeah, now try to talk with like modern dialect and blah, blah, blah, you know.
00:17:07 I feel like there's just, when you're sick, there's like mucus in your brain too. So like,
00:17:12 your like thoughts have to kind of blow in order to open up the passageway to get to the other
00:17:16 parts of your brain that control what you're saying. I don't know if you can tell, but I am a
00:17:23 deliberately slurping more slurperly so that you can like tell that I'm slurping. I know that like
00:17:30 radio people do that with like say like holding a piece of paper, like like Rush Limbaugh does that,
00:17:35 where he's like, okay, so, you know, there's some certain things that were in the news today,
00:17:39 and I printed them out and he'll do this and be like, when he like reads the papers that you know,
00:17:45 he's reading a paper, like if you pick up a piece of paper, it's going to sound like this,
00:17:49 right? But he makes it go like this, right? But then eventually like people were calling in being
00:17:54 like Rush, that's so annoying, why are you doing that? That's so unnecessary. And he's like, well,
00:17:59 fine. So eventually it got to the point where he's like, so there was something in the news today,
00:18:03 I printed it out. It says blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:18:14 Man, I'm so glad my sore throat is gone, like there's no way I can be in a good mood when
00:18:18 my sore throat is over. There's nothing more annoying than a sore throat. Well, okay, headaches
00:18:22 are worse. I, you know, I just, I generally have good health, so I don't have to worry about things
00:18:26 being painful on my body. And so therefore, the things that do occasionally go wrong, like a sore
00:18:32 throat, makes me really sad. It's, I really hate not being able to talk. Yeah, so, you know,
00:18:39 like I'm sure most of you know that like Digi has talked about, like there was this period where
00:18:43 him and his family were poor. I think there was like a couple of periods where that was happening,
00:18:46 I'm not really sure. And like I was always assuming like that they were like, poor, poor, like, you
00:18:52 know, like, like shitty house life, terrible, poor and stuff. And I was like, yeah, you know, I've
00:19:00 never like been poor like that, you know, like I was, I've always been like, yeah, you know,
00:19:05 like our families just always like had our, you know, her finances together for the most part.
00:19:11 Um, but then, like I was in the car with him one point, like, like, like a month or two ago,
00:19:16 and like he was mentioning like, oh yeah, yeah, we were so poor, we were on food stamps for like
00:19:20 four months. And I was like, wait, and I was like, wait a second, like there were times where my
00:19:26 family was on food stamps for like two years. And we're not that, and most of the time before and
00:19:32 after that, we were only slightly better off than we were during that period. And like, even now,
00:19:37 my dad's business is successful and all, but we have to pay so much taxes. And we're like three
00:19:43 years behind on paying taxes, my family is. So it's almost like we don't have all that money for
00:19:47 the most part, you know, like amenities and spending and splurging is still very, very
00:19:52 thinly spread even today. I was like, wait, have I always been poor? I was like, but I guess by
00:20:00 other people's standards, I guess so. And did you was like, yeah, if you're, if you were on food
00:20:05 stamps and you were poor, and I was like, oh, and did you was like, you know, I mean, I guess part of
00:20:09 it is that when we were on food stamps, we were also living with like annoying relatives. And so
00:20:14 that was what made it miserable. And like, it just wasn't a good life situation. And I was like, okay,
00:20:19 that really explains it then, because it's like, no matter what's ever gone on with my family and
00:20:24 our finances, they, my parents have just always acted really calm, like they're always on top of
00:20:28 things. They never freak out. They're never, they're never like getting overwhelmed with stress.
00:20:34 You know, there's only been like a couple of times when my dad got a little bit mad at me
00:20:38 from like stress, he was like, okay, let's go like that kind of that kind of burst out outburst,
00:20:43 like that kind that that's, that's like the most mad by dad gets at things, you know,
00:20:49 my mom only ever gets mad at me when I waste something, like sometimes I'll throw out some
00:20:55 boiling water and she'll be like, why'd you throw out that boiling water? We could have done something
00:20:58 with it. And I'm like, I'm sorry, mom, I changed my mind about what I wanted to eat. And she'll be like,
00:21:04 like my, my parents, they got like married when they were like 33, and they had me their first
00:21:09 child when they were 34. So like, they were completely competent adults before they had
00:21:13 children. So, you know, they'd had marriages before, but they didn't have any kids. So like,
00:21:18 I was their first child. So like, that's the benefit of having kids when you're old is that
00:21:22 you're really mature. So I never felt like we were poor, like we always had our shit together.
00:21:27 That's the thing, you know, I never felt poor. I just felt like I couldn't have nice things,
00:21:33 you know, like, and recently, I've kind of sort of gotten into Stefan Molyneux,
00:21:40 who's like this libertarian YouTube political guy. A lot of his modern videos are him going like,
00:21:49 oh, you know, Trump may be flawed, but the left is saying this about Trump, and it's completely
00:21:54 inaccurate. And you're just also completely daft. I can't believe you'd be like that. And then,
00:21:58 as I continue to reiterate the point over and over again, I start acting really raspy. I start
00:22:03 doing this really raspy voice where I stick my teeth out. I just keep saying the same thing over
00:22:07 and over again. Getting raspy, I'm raspy, I'm getting even raspy. The left is so retarded,
00:22:12 you're all put to altars. And then I get back to the topic and I have this very concerned look
00:22:18 on my face and continue with the subject and I never edit my videos. It's just one long take
00:22:24 of me being in front of my microphone and bobbing back and forth in front of my blue background.
00:22:28 and never editing out anything I ever say, and brilliantly I never say um for the most
00:22:33 part and I never stutter or have long gaps, I just keep talking which is probably exactly
00:22:38 why I reiterate my points over and over again and have to go into that recipe voice in order
00:22:42 to fill in all the space, I don't know why I don't just fucking edit my videos.
00:22:49 But he's been doing them for a fucking long time, I introduced him to Digi saying hey,
00:22:55 this is what I expect your body of work to be like in 10 years from now, because Devon
00:23:00 Molyneux has done these like podcast video things since 2005, like he was on YouTube
00:23:07 at the very beginning of YouTube right, I think he started his podcast before YouTube
00:23:12 was around, he has 3500 podcasts, like he does like multiple every week, and they're
00:23:19 usually like long, they range from 30 minutes to 2 hours every time, unbelievably prolific
00:23:25 guy, um okay, I really wanted to talk about Devon Molyneux because I find him fascinating
00:23:30 and like his early content is not really about current issues or at least not the ones I
00:23:36 listen to, a lot of his stuff is, his early stuff especially is just like theoretical
00:23:41 philosophy about you know like libertarian ideals of like hey what if the state didn't
00:23:46 exist or what if the state was like this instead of this, you know, and it's pretty good stuff,
00:23:52 a lot of it is definitely things I haven't heard before, it's really terrible audio quality
00:23:56 in the beginning, but it's interesting stuff, and there's one video of his, there's one
00:24:02 of his first YouTube videos, probably like his 250th podcast or so, but anyway it's
00:24:06 one of his first videos, and he's just in his car talking about stuff, talking about
00:24:10 like Nazis and like you know, can you, like okay, you can't blame a soldier that was said
00:24:15 shoot them or I'm gonna shoot you, and you can't blame the generals because the general
00:24:18 was told hey tell that guy to shoot him or I'm gonna tell someone to shoot you, and
00:24:22 you can't blame the marshals because the marshal was told to do this and that, now there were
00:24:25 plenty of Nazis who decided to rise up the ranks in Nazism and who like did more than
00:24:34 they had to, so you can blame them, but they didn't necessarily know that their government
00:24:38 was that evil, not at the beginning, you know, and even other people, like how many people
00:24:42 can you really blame, and what Stefan Malinu said was that the only, in my opinion, the
00:24:47 only people who are perfectly guilty are the intellectuals, we're the philosophers, the
00:24:52 people who sat in their colleges and their campuses and in their homes and just wrote
00:24:57 ideas, and their ideas were evil, that kind of thing, and anyway, I swear I'm gonna bring
00:25:03 this back to the whole me being not with money in my family thing, he's like, you know, so
00:25:10 many of these philosophers back in the day who spurred on Nazism were trying to, were
00:25:17 falling into a sin that many philosophers do, a mistake that many philosophers make, is
00:25:23 that they were trying to normalize the way that they were raised into an ideology that
00:25:28 the world could live by, all of these philosophers, many of them were raised by Lutheran families,
00:25:34 Lutheran fathers who had a very strict, harsh, you know, uncunning, unforgiving style of
00:25:41 parenting that was very strict, very harsh, very punishing, and so when they took to their
00:25:47 books and they took to their writing, they tried to like come up with a world philosophy,
00:25:51 a set of rules by which society could operate that reflected the way that they were raised,
00:25:56 they were trying to normalize the way that they were raised, trying to rationalize the
00:26:02 mistakes and crimes and sins of their parents as something that is a moral good or a moral
00:26:07 necessity, things like many philosophers fall into this trap, Ain Rand herself couldn't
00:26:12 avoid falling into this mistake, so I, you know, listened to that and it made me reflect
00:26:17 on myself and like, okay, well, how was my view of the world influenced by the way I
00:26:22 was raised and like, you know, because we'd never had money really, we never had like,
00:26:26 we always had enough money to be just fine and be comfortable, but never enough money
00:26:31 to like buy nice things, and like, I was really brought up in this like mentality that if
00:26:38 you want something nice, you have to work to make it happen, like if you want something
00:26:43 cool, you have to put in extra effort to earn the money to make it, if you want something
00:26:49 to happen, you just gotta make it happen yourself, that no one's gonna come in and just give
00:26:55 it to you, you know, and like, as I've grown up and had different life experiences, I've
00:27:00 been adjacent to like, people who it's like, their parents just give them a friggin' like
00:27:07 beach house or something or a little apartment condo next to a lake with a boat, like here,
00:27:12 you guys can have that, you just got married, have it, and it's like, wow, you know, I don't
00:27:17 have any, we don't have any like rich people in our family, and like, you know, my family
00:27:22 isn't poor enough to get like, that many government amenities, and whenever we do,
00:27:27 my dad's goal is to make enough money to where we don't have to have that, you know, when
00:27:31 we were on food stamps, my dad's one of his biggest priorities was make enough money so
00:27:35 we can buy all our own food, with our own money, I mean, we'll take advantage of handouts
00:27:41 if we're given, if we're given them, right, but you know, the idea is, you know, try to
00:27:46 not be dependent on that, and so I really think that that's kind of like where my mentality
00:27:51 comes from, of like, you shouldn't expect to be given stuff, you know, like, you just
00:27:56 have to make it happen on your own, and like, you know, as an adult, I can reflect on that
00:28:00 like mentality and be like, yeah, but like most people don't think exactly like that,
00:28:05 like a lot of people are like, you know, hey, if you're given something, you'll do something
00:28:08 nice with it, you know, if you're just given something for free, you're not just gonna
00:28:12 be lazy, you're gonna like put effort into like making that gift worth something, and
00:28:16 those people are right, you know, most people, if given a handout, are gonna be responsible
00:28:21 with it, but like my default mentality of things is, you can't expect to be given anything,
00:28:26 like not that it's wrong to be given something, but like, you shouldn't expect it, like, like,
00:28:31 like, as a teenager, learning about how like jobs work, and how like benefits and like
00:28:36 pensions work, I was like, why would you be given money after you stopped working, like,
00:28:41 why would you still be getting paid after you stopped doing the job that you're getting
00:28:45 paid for, you know, like, what's, what's the point of that, like, why, why is that
00:28:49 normal, right? And when I first heard of benefits as a thing, like as a kid, like, oh man,
00:28:55 a great dental plan, a great health plan, you know, they give you a car, I'm just like,
00:28:59 why not just give you more money? Like, why do they have to buy these things for you?
00:29:04 Why don't if they have this extra cash to spend on you, just give you the cash, you
00:29:08 know, just give you the money and let you decide what to do with it. And like, I'm always
00:29:13 thinking, oh man, if you get this, then what's it being taken out of, you know, like, if
00:29:18 you're given a car with your job, that just means you're going to get paid less in your
00:29:22 actual wages, probably equivalent to exactly the price of that car. But like, I talk to
00:29:28 my friends and stuff, not my PCP friends, they're all smart, but like, normie friends,
00:29:31 like, people who I've encountered in my life, and they don't, it doesn't seem like that
00:29:35 crosses their minds, you know, like, or like, oh man, this business doesn't give us a dental
00:29:39 plan, they can't afford it or whatever. And it's like, yeah, and like, if they gave you
00:29:43 a dental plan, they just pay you less money, you know, like, because like, anything they
00:29:46 give you is money, they're not giving you. Why don't they just give you the money and
00:29:50 then you can decide to go to the dentist yourself, right? And I know it's because like, with
00:29:55 insurance specifically, it's like, if more people get insured by the same place all at
00:30:00 once, it's more efficient, you know, obviously, there's lots of detailed economic ramifications
00:30:05 that make way more sense. But just my I'm just talking about my like, you know, worldview,
00:30:10 the way it was said, as a young age was like, you know, if I'm given something by my parents,
00:30:17 it's going to come out of somewhere, I was made very acutely aware of that, you know.
00:30:21 So whenever I think about whenever I like, you know, I mean, stuck in an airport all
00:30:25 night and CNN is in every single room, and they're debating the value and merits of like,
00:30:29 this government program that gives people health care versus this government program
00:30:33 that gives people health care versus this government program, it gives people this
00:30:37 and that, and gives people this and that, I'm immediately thinking, well, at the cost
00:30:41 of what, what are we not getting as a result of paying for that, you're not just getting
00:30:44 the money out of nowhere, is basically just coming out of taxes, right? And yeah, the
00:30:49 people who like, are the richest are the ones who are going to get taxed the most, but that
00:30:53 just means they're going to be spending less money on stuff, and spending money stimulates
00:30:57 the economy, which helps everyone. So it's like, you know, like, I just sort of naturally
00:31:02 assume that things are going to come from somewhere. And that's why when I listened to
00:31:07 Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell, and it said exactly the way that my worldview was, I was
00:31:12 that I got so excited about that. That's why I love that book so much. It just, it just,
00:31:16 it just, it just sort of gives like this structure and like, this like actual factualism to like
00:31:23 the way that I see the world already, you know, and I don't know how flawed that book
00:31:28 is. I don't know how many people have poked holes in its logic, but it seems it just makes
00:31:32 so much sense to me that that's why it's my favorite book. Well, certainly my favorite
00:31:37 nonfiction book. But yeah, again, you know, I try to be like open minded about things.
00:31:42 And I've sort of, you know, like, again, as I said, when you give people stuff, two out
00:31:49 of three times, they're going to do something good with it, you know, like think about the,
00:31:53 the parable from the Bible, right? Where the parable that Jesus tells his followers is
00:31:59 okay, there's this dude who owns like this, like this, this is like a real estate guy
00:32:03 has a big house, has a lot of money, has like some farmland, and he's going to go out on
00:32:07 a trip and he's got three servants and he's like, okay, a servant, I'm going to go out
00:32:11 on this trip, but I want you to do stuff with my money, do stuff with my resources, right?
00:32:15 So one servant, he gives 10 shillings to like, okay, do stuff with these 10 shillings, you
00:32:21 know, benefit my, my estate and you over there, the second guy, I'm giving you five shillings.
00:32:26 Okay, now you over there, the third guy, I'm going to give you one shilling, all three of
00:32:30 y'all do stuff with that money, make it, make it productive, um, do good stuff with it and,
00:32:36 you know, I'll, I'll be back. So when the dude left and came back, he was like, all right,
00:32:40 guys, the three of you, show me what you did. And the first guy's like, dude, I invested
00:32:45 the 10 shillings and now it's 20. The second guy's, dude, I invested the five shillings,
00:32:49 now it's 10. And he's like, you two are awesome, go to heaven, basically is what he says. It's
00:32:54 like, you get to have lots of reward. But then the one shilling guy, he was like, oh, sir,
00:32:59 you know, I know that you're all harsh and shit, and you're all like judgmental and unforgiving.
00:33:03 So I didn't want to risk losing it. So I just buried it, you know, and so here it is, I dug
00:33:09 it out, you know, it's got some dirt on it, but I hope you still like it. And, and, and the dude is
00:33:13 like, you're such a fuck boy. For first of all, don't talk to me like that. Like, what do you
00:33:19 mean I'm judgmental? Oh, shit. I mean, don't complain. Goddamn, Jesus Christ.
00:33:24 But also, you're a big lazy butthole, just sitting on all that money, you should take a risk, you
00:33:29 should try and be responsible with it. Don't lays out, I'm sending you to hell, or what he
00:33:34 says in the metaphor is, you're gonna get punished for that, go into the fucking dungeon or whatever.
00:33:40 So like, you know, it's Jesus telling the world that like, you know, if you're given something,
00:33:45 do something with it, take a chance, you know, any gift you have, be it a talent or money.
00:33:51 But the thing is, and I just realized this five minutes ago, which is why I told this parable
00:33:55 to you guys, is that this kind of shows that, yeah, two out of three people are gonna be good.
00:34:00 Like, overall, that dude's estate profited immensely from that, from those handouts.
00:34:06 Like, even if he'd given all three of them the same amount of shillings, like if you'd given
00:34:10 them 10 to each of them, he would have broke even on those last 10, but he would have made
00:34:16 20 shillings in profit on those first two guys who actually are good.
00:34:20 So, you know, like when you think about that, it have a harder time just thinking of government
00:34:26 handouts as these things that just promote poverty and shit. Really, the reason why government
00:34:30 handouts do that is because they're designed to do that on top of just being handouts. I don't know
00:34:35 if you guys know what like conservatives, but especially libertarians say all the time is that
00:34:39 if you're given stuff, then you're gonna be dependent on being given stuff, and therefore,
00:34:43 it's gonna be harder to make stuff for yourself. And also, those handouts incentivize you to not
00:34:49 do work, so therefore, you're gonna become less productive and you'll be even more dependent on
00:34:53 it. And so, people are like, yeah, we need to stop handouts, but I'm like, why not just do handouts
00:34:58 that don't encourage not working, right? Like, disability benefits. I have an uncle,
00:35:06 uncle bill, because everyone has an uncle bill. My uncle bill, like, my uncle bill was a construction
00:35:11 foreman and stuff or something like that. He's a construction dude, laying down concrete, and he
00:35:16 like destroyed his back doing that. He had to get surgery, and his back is all sensitive and like
00:35:21 easy to make him miserable at all times. So, he got disability for that. And it's like, you know,
00:35:27 like, I guess what I've been told by like other members of my family is that dude, like, he could
00:35:31 just be a foreman. Like, he could just tell people what to do and like not lift a finger. He is so
00:35:36 skilled. He knows his shit so well that he could easily make bank just showing up at a construction
00:35:42 site and pointing at what to do. And he wouldn't have to lift a finger. He could be doing like,
00:35:47 like physically, it wouldn't be that much worse than just sitting in his apartment, which is what
00:35:51 he does, right? Um, it's not like he does nothing. He is like a hobbyist dude. He does do some work
00:35:56 for people. He does like mixing music and painting stuff. But, you know, none of it is like making
00:36:01 him money. Um, he just lives off the disability for like, last, I don't know, 15 years or so.
00:36:08 Um, and he said that like, well, if I was a foreman, people would be screwing things up,
00:36:12 and I wouldn't be able to resist going up and grabbing something myself and then destroying my
00:36:16 back. Whatever. But like the point is, like, he's, I think he's like outright said, you know, if I
00:36:22 was better, if I did work and I wouldn't get the disability, and therefore, you know, my, my
00:36:27 income would be less secure. And it's like this thing, you know, it really encourages you to be
00:36:33 like that. Um, that's, that's how the disability works. It's like, if you're basically government
00:36:37 handouts, at least in America are like, if you're useless, then you get free stuff, you know, so it
00:36:44 incentivizes uselessness. So the thing is, okay, that's a obvious problem with handouts, right?
00:36:50 And like, you know, people talk about how like in the inner cities, in American cities, that's
00:36:55 where like handouts are the most pervasive, and that's where people are the most poor, and then
00:36:59 there's crime and stuff. And so it's like, you know, like, oh man, all these handouts have like
00:37:03 ruined cities and stuff, and it brings down the overall quality of life in America, on average.
00:37:09 And it's like, okay, but like, are those handouts disastrous, just because they're handouts, or
00:37:16 are they disastrous because they're disastrous handouts with bad ideas stacked on top of the
00:37:20 idea of just being free shit, right? So what I'm getting at is that people have been talking about
00:37:26 the idea of universal basic income, which is something I've talked about on my DeVugos
00:37:31 to Saturn channel recently, which is everyone gets a thousand bucks in their bank account
00:37:36 at the end of the month, every month, everyone gets it. Like each social security number gets
00:37:43 a thousand dollars in your bank account every month, no matter who you are or what you do.
00:37:50 Like even if you're a felon, even if you're a billionaire, right, it doesn't just go to poor
00:37:55 people. So if you're poor, you don't have to worry about making money and then losing the thousand
00:38:01 dollars, right, you're going to get it no matter what. So like it's going to be useless to all
00:38:05 those billionaires, right, like it's going to be wasting the money on the billionaires because
00:38:09 they don't need the money, right? But the point is the reason to give it to everyone is so that you
00:38:13 don't have the bureaucratic overhead of making sure you're not too rich, right? And you don't have to
00:38:19 make people afraid to become independent. If you give someone something no matter what,
00:38:23 then they won't be afraid to continue being useless. And of course, when you hear something
00:38:27 like that, you're like, okay, plenty of people will just never work ever. I'm pretty sure Ben has
00:38:34 told me like, yeah, if I was given a thousand dollars every month, I just wouldn't do anything.
00:38:38 And I guess that's fair enough. But I would do stuff with that money. I would still work.
00:38:43 And I know Digi would still work, I think. So that there we go. Once again, two out of three,
00:38:48 right? Now, can the economy survive if two out of three people are productive? I don't know.
00:38:53 But I'm just saying like, I find that to be an idea worth trying out or something. Try it,
00:38:59 you know, like just just do it. Come on, like all we got to do is just upend our entire economy
00:39:04 and legal system for just a couple of years. Just try it out, guys. Geez. God, I'm so annoying in
00:39:11 this one. I'm doing all these stupid voices. I'm the I'm the new Stefan Malinu, man. And people
00:39:17 have talked about how like, let's say you are a loser who like, you know, blows your money on alcohol
00:39:23 or weed every month. And like, you can't get a job because you're completely incompetent.
00:39:28 And in our current society, those people will probably either end up on the streets,
00:39:32 or more likely just end up crashing in their family or friends' couches forever
00:39:36 and ruin everyone's lives. They're their own and the people around them. They'll make everyone
00:39:40 miserable and they'll be shitty people. And what I've heard people say when defending universal
00:39:45 basic income is that it will take away those people's excuses to not do anything. Because like,
00:39:50 here's the thing, you know, in our current reality without universal basic income, if like,
00:39:56 the dude's sister who he's sleeping with is like sleeping, you know, on her couch and stuff,
00:40:01 he's like, I can't do anything. And she's like, dude, just go get a job, like clean up,
00:40:06 go try out for jobs and stuff. And he's like, no, I can't do it. I have no money. I can't do
00:40:11 anything. I can't afford new clothes. I can't afford to like shave every day. I can't afford
00:40:17 to like get a haircut. And you know, I can't afford shampoo. So like, how am I supposed to get a job
00:40:22 anyway? You know, I can't afford a car. I can't afford this. I'm completely out of I'm completely
00:40:27 out of resources, man. I can't do anything, man. You know, that's the that's the kind of excuse
00:40:32 that some people give. But in the reality with universal basic income, she can be all like,
00:40:38 dude, you're going to get $1,000 on the first. All right. So use that money to clean up. Okay.
00:40:44 And if you don't do it, I'm kicking you out. So it sort of like takes. Yeah, sure. $1,000 can
00:40:49 be people's excuse to not work. But it can take away your excuse that you're completely helpless,
00:40:55 right? It takes away your excuse that you have no power, that you have no resources,
00:41:00 that you have no choices. And I'm like, yeah, that makes that makes perfect sense. Again,
00:41:05 so many of government handouts are bad because they like give you something very specific. And
00:41:10 the government themselves decides what to give you and when and how. And then they give you all
00:41:15 these rules that you have to follow in order to do it, you know, they so it's like the government
00:41:19 trying to control you, which is obviously what the government wants to do. The reason why government
00:41:24 handouts are so popular with every government is not because they want to be generous to people.
00:41:30 They do it because it's an amazingly convenient way to control people's lives and the corral people
00:41:35 and the living the lifestyle that the bureaucrats want us to live. The fact that it's so politically
00:41:40 popular is what makes it so pervasive. I mean, obviously, the government would just tell us what
00:41:46 to do, you know, in a completely totalitarian way if they could. But that's politically unpopular,
00:41:51 you want to win elections like that. But handouts with a bunch of rules and the shit is a way to
00:41:56 tell people what to do and tell people how to live. That is politically popular, you know,
00:42:00 every politician can come up and be like, y'all, we're going to give you this free thing. And the
00:42:05 guy who is running against me who doesn't want to give you this free thing, he wants you to die.
00:42:09 So don't vote for me instead. And those people are able to win elections, you know. I mean,
00:42:15 you may think that in America a couple months ago, those people did not win. But even the
00:42:20 Republicans who won this time aren't saying we're not going to give you stuff. They're just saying
00:42:25 we're going to give you something slightly different than what you're getting right now, you know.
00:42:29 So, you know, there you go. It's still basically the same thing. There's no one winning elections,
00:42:33 even in America, who is outright saying we're going to give you less stuff. Even like hardcore
00:42:40 conservative people, like Ted Cruz, I don't think ever says let's give people less stuff.
00:42:44 He's just saying let's clean up the bureaucracy in the stuff giving committee. And obviously,
00:42:50 I'm not saying we should stop giving people stuff at all either because people are dependent on it.
00:42:54 You know, it may be a fucked situation that our government is in, that our society is in,
00:42:59 but you can't just stop doing it because people need it. It's like government bullshit,
00:43:05 societal bullshit is like a game of Jenga where you have all these blocks of bullshit that have
00:43:10 stacked up. But if you can't just dismantle it, you know, haphazardly, if you just take out the
00:43:15 bottom, if you just start taking it apart, it's going to collapse and cause a 9-11 all over everyone's
00:43:20 face. So, you know, if you want to dismantle it, you have to do it slowly and know exactly how to
00:43:25 do it so that not too many people die. I'm calling it, I'm saying die that way because there was
00:43:31 someone on CNN who was like, you know, if we were peeling, replace Obamacare the way that Trump
00:43:36 is saying it, people are going to die. People are going to die, okay? There was some doctors who said
00:43:41 that like if we take away Obamacare, some people are going to die. They're going to die. They're going to die.
00:43:48 I'm going to be so impressed if people can get through this without like their eyes watering
00:44:03 from the annoyance of my voice. You know, when I was in the airport being all sick and stuff
00:44:09 and sneezing sometimes, my sneeze are so loud that there's always like at least someone who will say
00:44:16 bless you. Like it's so loud that like there's always going to be like it's like like it's going
00:44:20 to turn like five people's heads and whoever says bless you first is going to say it and I'm going
00:44:25 to be like thank you because I sneeze so loud whether or not I'm sick. What the hell was I talking
00:44:31 about? Oh yeah, yeah, the money with the you know, there's one last thing I want to say about it. Like
00:44:34 I think one of the moments that really started to shift my perspective about the idea of giving
00:44:39 people free stuff was when I watched Scarface all by myself on VHS in my room because that's
00:44:45 something I do. You know, my whole why don't I like movies series which is on my main channel
00:44:51 is a reflection of something that I used to do a lot which is just look at my
00:44:55 collection of VHS tapes and then sometimes randomly watch one. So that's how I saw Scarface.
00:45:00 And my favorite scene from the movie, my favorite moment, my favorite line is toward the end when
00:45:05 Scarface is in his giant you know gold studded jacuzzi just hanging out being topless being
00:45:10 naked probably underneath the bubbles and like his girlfriend or whoever it's been a while I only
00:45:14 watched it once but like you know the lady person is all like you know trying to like talk to him
00:45:19 or do a thing and Scarface is just Charles Foster canning it up to like no tomorrow he's just being
00:45:25 all like yo man like don't don't give me this shit bitch don't talk to me like that I'm I'm the best
00:45:32 I'm the goddamn go to I'm fucking don't I'm the best fucking fuck you you know he's being a total
00:45:41 asshole to her and she's like why are you being such an asshole he's like look at me see all this
00:45:46 I'm the look at me I'm obviously the best I made all this happen I sold coke and shot dudes in the
00:45:51 balls better than anybody so I earned my place on the throne and she just says I wish you had been
00:45:59 given your money I wish you'd been given your wealth instead of earning it because if you've
00:46:02 been given it you'd feel guilty and you'd feel an obligation to be nice with it you'd feel an
00:46:06 obligation to do good with it and then she like you know stormed off being all mad and stuff or
00:46:12 something like that and he's all just like you know and that's what happened and I was like
00:46:18 and I watched that scene and I was all like man yeah that's actually a good point when like
00:46:25 sure on one hand you can say that if someone earns something they're gonna be more responsible for it
00:46:29 and uh and if someone is given something they're gonna be irresponsible with it but sometimes
00:46:34 it can also work the exact opposite way where if you earn something you feel like oh well since I
00:46:37 earned it and I could do whatever I want in a minute but if you were given it you're like oh
00:46:41 shit I don't really deserve this I need to like do good with it and I'm like yeah that's a good point
00:46:51 okay that's enough of that topic you're listening to free to view radio
00:46:55 and now let's move on to the next subject I wrote on my uh my notes here so um you know my girl's
00:47:01 been like I don't want to call her okay her name is Nikki okay Nikki was telling me you know hey I want
00:47:06 to meet your friends like turn on you know the facebook messenger face cam chat app or turn on
00:47:15 audio call and then shove the phone in front of your friends I want to talk to them I want to
00:47:19 introduce me to them and I'm like no I don't know that'd be weird and she's like why do you
00:47:27 why don't you want to show me off me me me and I'm all like cuz they'd be weirded out by that
00:47:34 and she's like why and I'm like I don't know it's just how guys are geez you know it's like
00:47:39 digi specifically has even mentioned like yeah you know I don't I don't like it when guys show
00:47:44 off their girlfriends to me you know like if you show that to a bunch of dudes they're just gonna
00:47:47 be like oh fuck you all happy in a relationship go die on the washington memorial by landing on it
00:47:54 from an airplane ass first you know that kind of thing and but you know meanwhile if a girl shows
00:48:00 off her boyfriend or her friends it's like they're all like oh hey I'm so happy for you and I'm like
00:48:04 okay I guess that makes sense you know and so that's why I mean like like I only know you know like
00:48:09 specifically because digi specifically says I don't like it when guys show off their girlfriends I
00:48:13 mean like I'm not gonna do it to him I'm only like like look Nikki you'll meet them at some point you
00:48:17 know it'll just happen naturally she's like why doesn't it happen now what happened now I'm like
00:48:22 so meanwhile when I was visiting her for a week just now there was a day where like we went and
00:48:33 met a bunch of her friends and their family and stuff and I thought it was a fun time you know
00:48:39 we didn't talk much but you know they were all hanging out with each other and I was just sort
00:48:43 of there hugging the shit out of her and you know I was like okay cool you know and and we met them
00:48:48 and and and that was that but then the next day it turns out that like most of her friends hated me
00:48:54 like they were like they were mad at her for how I was quote unquote acting terribly or something
00:49:01 like I was specifically like not talking for the most part I was just trying to be quiet you know
00:49:06 so I didn't so that wouldn't be annoying you know like I don't know what these friends of nikkies
00:49:10 are like I don't know like what kind of topics they'd be interested in I'll just like sit here
00:49:14 and wait for them to like bring up a topic and then I'll I'll say things and and you know if they
00:49:19 ask me questions I'll answer and I'll be like okay now I'm asking the question of you in return you
00:49:24 know I didn't want to you know yeah I was just trying to be quiet you know I said things you know
00:49:28 I was like I told jokes here and there but for the most part I was quiet but turns out some of her
00:49:33 friends hated that they were like why wasn't he opening up why was he being so reclusive
00:49:37 but what really um took me aback was that uh like a couple of them were saying that I was like
00:49:43 we're telling her we're complaining to her that I'm like so egotistical and arrogant
00:49:49 and I'm like well that's true but it really took me aback that like it shows so easily
00:49:56 like I can just sit there not say a damn thing yet it still comes through so strongly apparently
00:50:02 like it really it really left a big impression on them in that regard and I thought I was being
00:50:07 really polite and I was being really polite but they were still they they apparently were like
00:50:12 stealing with rage at me about it like okay there was a part in the car where we were in the car
00:50:18 and like one of them not the one who was driving it wasn't her car but she was like in the front
00:50:22 seat in the shotgun and she was like putting on some pandora in the car and it was like a bunch
00:50:29 of like billboard top 40 pop songs for the most part and it was like um a weird rock cover of somebody
00:50:36 I used to know was playing and I was like huh and and I and I looked at niki and I was just like
00:50:42 man you know when the uh when the interesting musicality of this track is taken away I notice
00:50:47 how kind of stupid the lyrics are lol you know I just I just said that offhandedly and then um
00:50:53 like at another point they were playing drive by by train and I was like oh man niki you know I heard
00:50:59 I watched this one youtube review of this song it was like deconstructing how it's like in a way
00:51:04 the worst lyrics possible like like hefty bag to hold my love that's a weird way to express love
00:51:10 and I even mentioned like I'm really enjoying the song though I love the beat of it I'm enjoying it
00:51:15 at least sitting now I'm enjoying all this music you know it's a fun time we're having um I was
00:51:21 even complimenting the scenery of that we were driving through I'm like man all this countryside
00:51:25 and these buildings and how the roads are like brown instead of gray that's so cool because like
00:51:31 they're like it's like brown tarmac which was totally unique um so those music comments were
00:51:37 interpreted by her as quote belittling my music taste unquote and I was like oh shit I guess you're
00:51:46 right I didn't think about that you know I my main friends my primary friends are people who
00:51:52 we we do podcasts where we just shit on each other's opinions constantly and then we have a
00:51:58 little discord chat where we shit on each other's for our opinions constantly I'm so not used to that
00:52:03 you know like for me just like making critical statements of some piece of media that is put
00:52:09 in front of me is totally normal and so natural I don't think about how you know it could affect
00:52:14 people now I mean I do I do think about it I don't try to be an asshole like it's just that it was
00:52:19 the kind of song she was putting on she was putting like pop songs that I've heard already and I never
00:52:24 listen to pop music I'm talking about music that's so popular I've heard it like again somebody I
00:52:29 used to know number one song of 2012 drive by by train one of those songs that was like a big hit
00:52:34 and is still played consistently to this day I feel like everyone is entitled to a positive or
00:52:40 negative opinion of those musics of those songs and is totally of their right mind to express them
00:52:47 openly like if the friend if that girl was even putting on like a full album of something or
00:52:53 was putting on something that was a little bit more obscure was putting on something with a little
00:52:56 bit more like specificity to it wouldn't have said a damn thing because I would have known that it was
00:53:02 like special to her you know like she did put on a bunch of like like mid-2000s like Disney pop
00:53:09 and she said yeah I love 2000s Disney pop like I know she was being ironic with it but like no no
00:53:14 no she wasn't being ironic with it she was being self aware about that fact but she was being sincere
00:53:19 like I love that that era that style you know that I'm so nostalgic for and Nikki even was like
00:53:25 yeah I totally agree you know and all that pre 2010 Disney pop I'm totally down with so just that
00:53:33 level of personal affection I wouldn't have said any critical thoughts I would have only said positive
00:53:39 things right but when you're when it's drive by by train I'm it's completely okay they'll be like
00:53:45 lyrics in this song are stupid because like those those songs belong to everyone you know
00:53:50 so I I don't think I did anything wrong I honestly I stand by anything I said that day but
00:53:59 it is I'm not like I don't like have a grudge or anything I just find it really interesting how I
00:54:03 come off to people you know like it's okay that they get mad at me or whatever like they can have
00:54:08 their opinion of me and it I was I was sort of getting the vibe that they were mad more because
00:54:15 Nikki spent so much time with me on chat and audio call that she doesn't spend as much time with her
00:54:21 friends as she used to and they're like kind of upset about that so the fact that when they finally
00:54:26 met me I wasn't like eminently charming or anything and was in fact really awkward and quiet
00:54:31 probably you know they were probably getting ready to they were probably kind of ready to get mad so
00:54:36 you know that that's perfectly understandable you know again I'm not saying that people shouldn't
00:54:39 be like that because people like that I don't really care about their opinion of me at all
00:54:44 which I guess is kind of a problem I guess that's where the arrogance comes from but still I do think
00:54:49 it's really interesting because it just goes to show what a weird social circle I surround myself in
00:54:56 in the form of the pcp we're like oh yeah it was like a culture shock sort of the sort of thing you
00:55:02 know and by the way Nikki herself is not like that at all she was like yeah they're my friends are
00:55:07 totally overreacting you didn't do anything offensive at all and Nikki will tell me if I do
00:55:12 think that they're awkward or weird like she will be open with me about that uh but she stands by
00:55:17 everything I said so I think I'm fine but yeah it's just normies man people with normal uh music
00:55:25 taste is a thing okay well that's the gradual annoying petering out of that topic as well
00:55:34 let's see what's else on uh what else osos or else is on my notes here
00:55:41 you know I was uh I was kind of upset when when the last day of being over at my girl
00:55:45 met Nikki came I was like oh man now I gotta pack it up gotta go away and she was like really
00:55:51 upset about it she was like no and I was like yeah don't worry we're gonna see each other again
00:55:56 you know um but I was packing and I was like getting really sentimental about the week we'd
00:56:01 spent in this little tiny hotel and like I whenever I'm packing to like leave a place
00:56:08 that I know I'm not gonna come back to again I get really sentimental about it like I'm like
00:56:12 okay this is it this sock here is the last sock that I need to pack and once I'm done with this
00:56:19 I'm done with the sock packing and like oh man this piece of trash right here is the last
00:56:23 piece of trash in the apartment here we go and I like hold it above the trash can and I'm like
00:56:29 and I drop it I need like slow motion falls into the trash can and I'm like that's the end of the
00:56:34 trash you know and like um when I'm going out the door I'm like this is it this is the last I'm
00:56:39 gonna see of this room done done done and like when I um when I was moving when I was moving out of
00:56:44 my parents house to come in you know live in Virginia like um I just had this really like I
00:56:50 packed over the course of like two days and I like did it really methodically and was like yep
00:56:55 that's this is the end I even filmed my room right before I left I was like this is what my room
00:56:59 looks like you know and and when I was stepping out the door on the way to get to the airport I'm
00:57:05 like okay I actually filmed myself walking out the door and like filming the last shot the last
00:57:11 glimpse of my room the way that it looked before my sister moved into it and made a mess out of it
00:57:17 like a mess that's even worse than a mess I had it in which uh you know I've been to my
00:57:21 room again I visited my family for the holidays but you know yeah um which reminds me of like um
00:57:27 another move that happened previously like three years ago um when I when my family moved in 2013
00:57:33 I was all prepared to pack sentimentally but then I got fucking sick and I was sick for like a whole
00:57:38 day and I couldn't get out of bed and then when I was finally better we had like a few hours to pack
00:57:43 and I was like I had to pack all like frantically and I couldn't be dramatic at all I couldn't be
00:57:48 like nostalgic at all and I was so pissed off I'm like I was cheated I was cheated out of my sentimentality
00:57:56 you know I just realized if we develop space travel and people can like move to Mars and stuff
00:58:01 will they be sentimental for the earth like will I be sentimental for the earth like I bet um like
00:58:06 you know the the travel company that will like hey no for 20 000 bucks go to Mars you know and
00:58:11 live there start be on the colony I bet they'll be like hey for an extra 3 000 or it'll probably be
00:58:17 like 100 000 to get to Mars and it's like oh hey for an extra 20 000 trip around the world for like
00:58:22 five months so you can finally see the earth you can finally see all those wonderful locations
00:58:27 that you never got to see on your home planet you know like just give them one final goodbye you
00:58:32 know before before you before you go on the ship to go to Mars and stuff that'll probably happen
00:58:41 so yeah yeah I packed it up and then I uh gone like gone the plane you know what and then I ended
00:58:48 up in the Chicago O'Hare airports which is which was the step the stepping stone to get over to
00:58:53 Virginia so I was like okay so which terminal do we got to go down and I went the wrong direction I
00:58:59 got to the end of like the C terminal I think and I was like okay so here I am actually no it was
00:59:05 like the E terminal or something or the F terminal I think it was E terminal and uh I was like oh wait
00:59:11 I'm at the end of the terminal it's a dead end wait this isn't the right place oh it's in the B
00:59:15 terminal so I began walking and it was a long ass walk you know every airport I've been to I've
00:59:22 always been told this is a small airport and I'm like what are you talking about this place is huge
00:59:27 like oh man the Virginia airport kind of a small airport I'm like what the Virginia airport is like
00:59:32 five times the size of the Kansas City airport that I come from you know um the Chicago airport
00:59:39 was like a Lovecraftian experience of a walk like it was just like giant giant endless
00:59:44 hallways one after the other it was ridiculous and it wasn't great on my ankle either incidentally my
00:59:50 ankle is is definitely still still healing and especially after this whole week where I spent
00:59:55 walking around with my girlfriend constantly now I'm now I'm back to sitting down and not walking so
01:00:01 hopefully it'll be healed up by by summer hopefully geez anyway you know it was a lot of walking
01:00:07 right and it's cool I love walking except for the fact that I have my ankle problem but other than
01:00:11 that walking is cool it was a really cool scenic trip and I was like man this is a cool place and
01:00:16 then my flight got delayed a couple times and then canceled and it's like yeah um you're gonna
01:00:21 have to go your flight is gonna be like 15 hours from now and I was like oh so it's like go to the
01:00:28 customer support place and they're gonna give you some meal vouchers and a hotel voucher and I'm
01:00:33 like okay so I went back to like the sea terminal or something and the line was super long and some
01:00:39 customer support lady was like hey go actually no no it was the B terminal that I was at but then
01:00:43 the customer lady was like hey the um customer support lady was like hey go to the sea terminal
01:00:49 and I was like okay because she said there's another line there that's not as long
01:00:53 I hadn't been to the sea terminal like on my trip from the E terminal to the B terminal
01:00:58 I didn't go to the C terminal so that one was like this huge like there's this underground bridge
01:01:04 you have to get through that's like all colorful and like just just felt like some sort of purgatory
01:01:08 land with those automatic runways walkways and then you get into the C terminal and it's like a
01:01:13 totally different section I didn't even see for lack of a better term and so it's like man this
01:01:18 place is so freaking huge and uh so I got up to the customer support and they were like okay
01:01:23 here's your meal vouchers and uh I actually declined a hotel voucher I was trying to negotiate for
01:01:28 just more meal vouchers but I didn't get the negotiation but I just refused the hotel voucher
01:01:34 and here's why first of all I don't want to have to um deal with like transitioning like
01:01:41 it was a difficult transition mentally to be like okay I'm with I'm at the hotel now I'm in a car
01:01:45 now I'm in you know the airport now I'm going through security now I'm in the airport then I
01:01:50 get on an airplane then I'm on an airport again right so what I wanted to do was then get on an
01:01:55 airplane then go to the Virginia airport then be in Digi's car then go get sushi and then I'm home
01:02:00 right that's the number of transitions if I get if I take the hotel voucher it adds two more steps
01:02:05 the step of get out of the airport get on a bus like a shuttle that they were gonna offer
01:02:10 go into a hotel check into a hotel just to be there for like one night then check out
01:02:15 then go into a bus again get into the airport and then go through security again for a couple of
01:02:21 reasons one I haven't done it enough times to be natural at it like I like the first time I went
01:02:26 through it I was like okay electronics go here but not big electronics but like what but like what's
01:02:30 a big electronic where is the scale there where is the line drawn you know and okay like sometimes
01:02:35 they just look through all my stuff but sometimes they just scan it you know and also uh this time
01:02:40 on the trip back I have a um a vibrator thingamajig that Nikki wanted me to get so I was like I don't
01:02:47 know how many times I want to like take that out and put it in a little plastic tray for everyone
01:02:51 to inspect you know but oh well um but the but the other problem with going through security again
01:02:57 was that over the course of packing leaving the hotel and like going through security the first
01:03:01 time uh my zipper just died like this is like a this is like a 13 year old um suitcase so the
01:03:09 zipper just died from pressure and so then when I was wading around in the Chicago airport the
01:03:15 zipper like just came completely undone I had no way to secure it and so like the the airport
01:03:19 people gave me some like tape okay they gave me tape to just seal it shut with tape so it's like
01:03:25 you know obviously I just have to get more tape but that'd be a pain in the ass I wouldn't want
01:03:28 to inconvenience them like that to rip off the tape and then ask them for more tape because they
01:03:32 might not have it with them uh I wouldn't want to have to buy my own tape I wouldn't have to
01:03:36 blow money on that and so it's like if I go to the if I go to the hotel I'm not gonna be able to
01:03:41 open my suitcase anyway right like I might be able to tap hazardly retie the tape but that would
01:03:47 just be such a pain so it's like I'm not gonna be able to be comfortable anyway because I'm not
01:03:50 gonna be able to open my suitcase not until I get home and now I am home I I still haven't opened
01:03:56 the tape yet but uh yeah I'm recording this before I put my clothes on and stuff but anyway
01:04:01 so there's there was that right all those reasons why I didn't want to go to a hotel but the number
01:04:06 one reason why I didn't want to go to the hotel was because you know I was getting sick I'd gotten
01:04:10 sick on the way packing from the hotel like like when I was leaving Nikki and I was like I was
01:04:14 getting a sore throat I was getting stuffy so at this point I was like thoroughly sick and I was
01:04:18 like okay in combination with my deliriousness from like transitioning from a hotel to an
01:04:25 airport and stuff I'm tired right I'm tired from expending all this energy I'm mentally
01:04:29 like tumultuous I'm like turbulence in my mind and I'm sick and I'm tired probably so what I assumed
01:04:36 would happen is that I'd get to the hotel I'd fall asleep at some point it would probably take me
01:04:41 a few hours to get to sleep and then I'd sleep so hard that my alarm won't wake won't wake me up
01:04:46 and then I'll miss my flight right like knowing me there's a decent chance that that could happen
01:04:53 not like a high chance but like not a chance that I would want to risk right
01:04:57 and uh and so then what I thought was that well obviously what's most likely is that I'd be so
01:05:03 afraid of that happening that I wouldn't be able to sleep at all like I'd never be able to be calm
01:05:08 enough to go to sleep because I'd be so nervous that that would happen so then I wouldn't be able
01:05:11 to sleep anyway so then what would be the point of going to the hotel and dealing with all the
01:05:15 inconveniences of that you know like just just stay in the airport so I refused the hotel voucher
01:05:20 and I thought I'm just gonna stay in the airport I'm gonna do the whole sleep in an airport thing
01:05:23 right because I knew that if I'm sleeping in the airport I'm not going to be able to sleep
01:05:28 comfortably enough I'll still be on edge enough that like I'll wake up easily right and indeed I
01:05:34 was only able to sleep for like 20 minutes here and there and lay down for a couple hours here and
01:05:38 there so you know but yeah uh so and also the other reason was that I thought being in this
01:05:44 in this airport for like 13 hours 15 hours would be pretty cool you know I'd just be wandering
01:05:49 around doing whatever I want have 20 dollars of free food you know so so I did it and um
01:05:56 you know uh I like the movie Terminal starring Tom Hanks where a dude gets stuck in a hood in an
01:06:02 airport for like years like a year and a half I think so or nine months I think yeah so that was
01:06:10 that was a cool movie and I was like I want to do that you know being on an airport for like 15
01:06:14 hours so there's this sort of like romanticization I have of it in my mind of like you know living all
01:06:19 it's like living on your own it's like this weird vagabond in this place
01:06:24 and it really didn't like get me down at all because it's like I'm always just thinking you know
01:06:29 when I get home I'm just gonna like lay down in bed and play earthbound a bunch on my phone using
01:06:34 a moga 2 pro controller where you can play a controller on your phone with an emulator of
01:06:40 super nintendo with earthbound inside of it right so like I'm just gonna do that when I get home
01:06:45 so if I'm stuck in the airport for 15 hours I'll just play earthbound for 15 hours same
01:06:50 difference just with a bunch of noise and fluorescent lighting around me I ended up not
01:06:54 playing that much earthbound though I was mostly just on a call with with nicky because she was
01:06:58 all sad that I was gone and so she just needed to keep talking to me and you know I was getting
01:07:03 pretty lonely so I guess the point is I felt really productive still like the small amount of
01:07:08 earthbound I played I felt really accomplished in and like the other things I was doing I felt
01:07:12 really accomplished in um there's like this uh the sort of narrative that unfolded with a towel
01:07:19 at the airport when I was there at the whole time uh which was the hitchhiker's guide to the
01:07:22 galaxy reference um to explain the joke to people in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy they mentioned
01:07:29 that if you have a towel with you a towel with you while you're hitchhiking you're gonna look
01:07:33 much more competent as an individual you will look like a hoopy fruit and a hoopy fruit means
01:07:38 someone who is really amazingly together someone who's really competent and knows what they're
01:07:42 doing if you have a towel with you so I read hitchhiker's guide on the flight over to see nicky
01:07:48 and I was like huh a towel and they just so happened to buy a towel at walmart when I was
01:07:53 with her because I felt like having an extra towel for the hotel and then when I was packing up I'm
01:07:57 like you know what it's going to be an unnecessary waste of space but I'm going to take the towel
01:08:01 with me uh just for the sake of being hoopy so um yeah and I tweeted about it extensively so I
01:08:08 recommend going to my twitter and scrolling down to like um February the 21st and just reading I
01:08:14 highly recommend reading all of my tweets from that from that uh section from that timeline
01:08:19 uh from the 21st up through march 1st yeah being in an airport uh I felt really
01:08:26 competent I felt really put together you know the only thing that sucked about it was being sick
01:08:31 and not being able to walk too much without my ankle getting sore
01:08:36 and motorcycle came and went anyway um yeah uh I felt really I felt like I was really using my
01:08:42 time really well and it was just that looming overhead knowledge of a schedule of like a time
01:08:48 you have to do something right like you know I've I've I've I've I've flown a bunch of times now
01:08:53 in the last in the last five months you know flying over to Virginia then flying over to my
01:08:58 family and back and then flying over to Nikki and back so it's like I've I've done the airport
01:09:02 experience a bunch of times in a row now like three times in a row now and every time I feel
01:09:07 really like I'm I'm managing my time well because there's again this looming overhead
01:09:12 schedule that you have to conform to but it's a schedule that mostly involves sitting around
01:09:17 right and whenever you see business dudes who obviously fly all the time with their laptops
01:09:22 they seem really wired they seem really plugged in they seem like they really know what they're
01:09:26 doing they seem like every second is being maximized for efficiency and that's what I felt like
01:09:30 um in the Chicago airport that whole time like I felt like I was always doing something
01:09:36 whether playing earthbound or talking to Nikki or tweeting something funny so and I was like I
01:09:42 wonder if that's part of how of where Casey Neistat gets his power because Casey Neistat's a very
01:09:47 prolific person who makes you know who did like a whole vlog series where he made a fully edited
01:09:53 vlog every day for like a year and a half just to do just for the sake of itself um and he still
01:09:58 makes a pretty decent upload of videos and he does all sorts of other business things all the time
01:10:03 I mean and it's because well not because but in addition to that he flies places all the time
01:10:09 like businesses phone him up be like hey fly to this place they give him a first class ticket
01:10:13 and he's just flying all the time all over the place and I'm like uh man I wonder if that's part
01:10:20 of where his productivity comes from that he do you always have these these these upcoming dates
01:10:25 where you have to do something but most of those dates involve sitting around and you can open
01:10:31 your laptop and do something then you know and I and I was like yeah it's it's a very distinct
01:10:37 different feeling from what I do normally and what Digi does normally and what Ben and the other
01:10:42 pcp people mostly do is you're just in your room for weeks on end not even really needing to leave
01:10:49 having to completely motivate yourself to get stuff done and I love doing that I love motivating
01:10:55 myself and and making it all happen and like I feel like I'm pretty good at it and stuff
01:11:00 but I do think it was a very interesting different feeling to have this whole airport thing going on
01:11:05 so maybe if you know maybe if when I'm rich and I can just fly around all for the sake of it or
01:11:12 I don't know like I do all these business things involve flying around a bunch maybe I'll be even
01:11:17 more productive then maybe I'll really dig that lifestyle I don't know but you know I don't probably
01:11:22 not necessary I'm pretty good at this being at home thing probably as a result of being home
01:11:29 schooled you know like my parents policy was basically like hey you can do what you want right
01:11:35 with your life like if you're willing to work and it's something sensible and you're going to be
01:11:38 responsible you can take the life path that you want to take right so like my younger brother he got
01:11:43 into like uh into like hunting and guns and like knives and just being like an outdoorsman kind of
01:11:48 dude so that's kind of the life he leads and also working with my dad and playing video games and
01:11:53 stuff but yeah he's just sort of he's sort of like that uh and you know working out and being slim
01:11:58 he doesn't work out enough to like have like visible muscles but he's got like a nice fit body and
01:12:03 stuff plays sports I think that kind of guy my sister you know she got into dancing and like
01:12:09 performing the performing arts so that's kind of her life and she actually wanted to like go to a
01:12:14 school so eventually she convinced my parents to be like okay you can go to like this sort of
01:12:19 Christian school thing you know um so that's her lifestyle right me I was just like oh I guess I'll
01:12:26 just stay in my house all the time you know I'll just stay inside I go outside a lot but mostly
01:12:31 just my backyard that's kind of what I like I like being outside I like fresh air and sunlight
01:12:37 but I'm okay just being on my own property you know that's what I like about trampolines you
01:12:41 know that's actually should have probably been on the list is uh it's a great way to like just exert
01:12:47 physical energy without leaving the site of your house you know it's a whole lot of activity
01:12:52 without without even going away from your back door and you know pools are the same thing so
01:12:57 that's kind of what I'm into you know I like getting out and going places but I'm perfectly
01:13:01 content to just stay still all the time and when all of your school work is also homework I guess
01:13:08 I just am good at at doing that kind of work where you just have to motivate yourself you're in your
01:13:14 bedroom you could be playing DS right now but you're gonna do the work anyway you know uh so so
01:13:19 there you go that's that was like my lifestyle choice in combination with the lifestyle my parents
01:13:24 sort of gave to me uh you know the downsides are that you know I'm more awkward as a result because
01:13:29 I didn't want to go out and like talk to people all the time so like you know I come off as like
01:13:33 quiet or when I do talk I'm way too loud uh you know that's a downside but the upside is that I
01:13:39 feel like I'm really well specced to be a youtuber like all my stats are really uh leveled up in that
01:13:46 regard uh to be a youtube person who can also work at making programs and stuff yippee whoops
01:14:01 and uh that's it that's the end of this episode of the devu hadron collider episode four even though
01:14:07 to me it feels like episode seven because of all those other ones I recorded that uh I don't know
01:14:12 maybe I'll release them at some point maybe I could um release them as bonus episodes only for uh
01:14:21 hmm maybe for the pcp patreon I could do that yeah maybe I'll do that I don't know
01:14:27 tell me how badly you'd want to listen to them I guess you'd probably want to listen to them just
01:14:31 because you have no idea what they're about but you know most of them are redundant off of each
01:14:36 other because each one was meant to be a replacement of the other one I don't know okay whatever
01:14:42 that's the end um I'm gonna take a sip of this tea even though it's all gone for dramatic effect
01:14:55 sighing for dramatic effect
