00:00:00 I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Hello, um, whatever.
00:00:16 Hello, uh, uh, I'm back.
00:00:20 The PZP is back, um, uh, and better than ever.
00:00:25 I don't know about that one.
00:00:28 I'm sorry, I'm feeling, you know, you ever have one of those days where you're like, uh, don't bother me till I've had my coffee, but then you get your coffee and you still don't want to be bothered?
00:00:41 Yeah, that's, that's cold every day.
00:00:44 That's me. I've been up for exactly half an hour.
00:00:48 And I got, okay, my big, the big news for me is that I got new internet, which means, um, it's time for me to start, to try to start streaming soon.
00:00:59 I'm gonna stream.
00:01:01 Hooray.
00:01:02 Hooray, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to stream, I'm gonna stream, I wanna stream the whole, uh, Battle Network series.
00:01:09 This week, sometime this week, I'll try like a test stream.
00:01:13 And if it works with no problem, then I will announce that the Battle Network extravaganza will begin.
00:01:20 Uh, and then I'll be doing that for God knows how long.
00:01:24 I'll make sure to stream exactly the same time to pilfer viewers.
00:01:28 Yes, we should divide and conquer, they say.
00:01:32 They mean it about yourself.
00:01:36 Um, I'm just looking, oh, and I'm just, and I'm just, and I'm just seething.
00:01:44 I'm just seething because this is my first time trying to discord call with my new internet, and it's working fine.
00:01:50 It's working great, except that the little green ring that says I'm talking doesn't, isn't, isn't working.
00:01:58 And I, I can't stand it.
00:02:02 I mean, I can see it, so I guess your discord's a little cringe at the moment.
00:02:10 Inexplicable, inexplicable.
00:02:13 Yeah, um, well, you know, uh, frickin, uh, the, let me, let me complain about other problems.
00:02:24 Um, the internet seems to be working good except for this, but this seems this is probably not even a real problem.
00:02:33 But there is another real problem, which is I had a, I had a torrents.
00:02:36 My torrents were downloading, and I had one torrent I was downloading, and it has stopped downloading since I switched networks.
00:02:46 And I don't know if it has anything to do with the network itself, or if maybe there's just no seeds seething the torrent anymore.
00:02:53 It would just be a coincidence.
00:02:55 Uh, but I got this big torrent that I was downloading for weeks, and now it's stuck at like 70% done.
00:03:03 And it was only gonna be, it was gonna be maybe another week, and I just want it.
00:03:07 I just want it so bad.
00:03:09 And I, and I don't know what to do.
00:03:12 I'm lost.
00:03:13 What are you torrenting?
00:03:15 What are you stealing?
00:03:18 Well, I'll just say it.
00:03:20 Since I had thought that I might do a history of Digi or the history of the PCP sort of lecture,
00:03:27 I was torrenting the DigiBro archive just to have everything.
00:03:31 Oh my god.
00:03:33 Yeah, I mean, it's a lot.
00:03:35 It's like, it's like, it's like, I think it's almost like a hundred, I think it's like almost a terabyte, all told.
00:03:42 Like the entire archive in all five parts.
00:03:45 Are you gonna watch it?
00:03:47 No, god, no, I just, I'm just putting it in a folder to just have it for reference in case I need stuff.
00:03:56 But yeah, the first parts one, two, three, and five are done.
00:04:00 And part four is all, is 600 gigabytes.
00:04:04 And it is, about 500 of it is done.
00:04:07 And now it's, it's just kind of stuck there.
00:04:10 And it's just, I just, maybe I'll ask Tarbuck, maybe I'll ask Tarbuck if he can seed again or something.
00:04:22 Because I see zero seeds.
00:04:24 So might not have anything to do with my internet actually.
00:04:27 I kind of imagine that many people are seeding that specific thing.
00:04:31 No, but there were, no, but I mean, it did get, it did get this far.
00:04:36 There were people seeding it up to, you know, to get me this 70% done.
00:04:44 So, you know, it's, it's, it should work.
00:04:50 Why would it stop now?
00:04:52 I don't know.
00:04:53 I don't know.
00:04:54 Yeah.
00:04:55 All right.
00:04:56 Well, that's all, that's all.
00:04:58 The last week, sorry for not appearing.
00:05:02 No, no problem.
00:05:04 No problem.
00:05:05 You got it.
00:05:06 You got a, nobody's perfect.
00:05:09 Yeah.
00:05:10 But the last, this whole last week I've been mostly, I have been mostly binging by binging
00:05:18 by a cool soul.
00:05:20 You ever heard of that?
00:05:21 Yeah.
00:05:22 I watched the first, I think like three seasons of it.
00:05:26 I watched it up to when it was current, when I watched it like three or four years ago,
00:05:34 I think.
00:05:35 So, I never finished it.
00:05:37 Have you finished it?
00:05:38 I mean, it's finished and I'm getting, I'm on season, the last season right now, just
00:05:43 beginning.
00:05:44 Okay.
00:05:45 So, we might, we might be pretty, I might have gotten to about the same place you have,
00:05:50 or something like that.
00:05:51 Yeah, it was a good show.
00:05:53 I did like it, but I never, yeah, it wasn't done back when I watched it.
00:05:59 And I've had a meaning to finish it ever since, since I heard it finished and everyone says
00:06:03 Kirk is such a genius.
00:06:05 And La-de-da.
00:06:06 Bob Odenkirk is such an actor.
00:06:08 I mean, I like Bob Odenkirk.
00:06:09 He's great.
00:06:10 He's an actor.
00:06:11 He's a good comedian too.
00:06:12 You ever see Mr. Show?
00:06:13 I didn't see Mr. Show, but I did see him on Tim and Eric's awesome show as like some of
00:06:18 the Cinco product stuff.
00:06:21 I think, I think Bob Odenkirk might have been like one of the guys who sort of like, who
00:06:30 sort of like backed Tim and Eric in their early days.
00:06:32 I think he sort of might have been there like patron.
00:06:35 Maybe.
00:06:36 I don't know.
00:06:37 I've heard that somewhere.
00:06:38 The lineage of these things.
00:06:42 That's just, that's just something I heard.
00:06:44 But anyway, Bob, yeah, I better call Saul.
00:06:48 Do you like it?
00:06:50 I like it.
00:06:52 I think Breaking Bad is a better show.
00:06:55 Wow.
00:06:56 But I think, I, well, this is the thing.
00:06:59 People say-
00:07:00 I've heard people go both ways on that.
00:07:03 I mean, I was sold on Better Call Saul being like way better or not way better, but like,
00:07:07 it's better than Breaking Bad, bro.
00:07:09 Yeah.
00:07:10 Yeah.
00:07:11 I'm like, hmm, well, it's the same show guys, same writers, you know, but probably good.
00:07:18 It is very good.
00:07:19 Gilligan, right?
00:07:20 Vince Gilligan.
00:07:21 Vince Gilligan.
00:07:22 Like showrunner?
00:07:23 Yeah.
00:07:24 I have one major problem with it.
00:07:26 It's not like a deal breaker, but it is undeniable that this is not actually-
00:07:33 a Saul show.
00:07:34 It is two shows.
00:07:35 It is a lawyer show about the rise of Saul Goodman from his lowly status.
00:07:44 There's a little boy behind his nail salon.
00:07:50 Yeah.
00:07:51 And then it's also the story of Mike Ermentraut and his introduction into the criminal underworld.
00:07:58 Mike is the old guy, right?
00:08:00 Yeah.
00:08:02 And I like these shows, but I think they sort of take a little-
00:08:08 Mike should have had his own show?
00:08:10 I think they take a little too much away from each other because they don't really meet up
00:08:16 until like season five.
00:08:17 They sort of like have passing like interactions here and there early on and then, you know,
00:08:24 season three and stuff.
00:08:27 But like mostly it's like Kim Wexler, Jimmy McGill, Chuck and all that lawyer stuff.
00:08:35 And then separately, almost completely separate at points is Mike and Gus and the Salamancos.
00:08:43 And that's- I think it's just made for the show being like very slow paced.
00:08:49 And I was like, when are they gonna do something together?
00:08:52 And it's like right at the end of the show and it's like now it's ramping up.
00:08:55 And I do like all the seasons.
00:08:57 I don't have like problems with the show, but I feel like it was overhyped in that sense.
00:09:04 Because like if you watch Breaking Bad, seeing how Gus built his empire or like-
00:09:10 Yeah.
00:09:11 It's interesting.
00:09:12 It's cool.
00:09:13 And Mike is cool.
00:09:14 And it's like cool.
00:09:17 Yeah.
00:09:18 But it's sort of like fan service in a good way, but like it's still fan service.
00:09:23 It doesn't like propel the story of Jimmy McGill.
00:09:26 It sort of like takes away from- it sort of pauses his story to talk about this thing for a bit.
00:09:32 And then very slowly, both stories-
00:09:36 That's what- that's the pacing.
00:09:37 That's the pacing issue I have.
00:09:39 That's my major issue.
00:09:40 It causes a pacing issue.
00:09:42 Do you think that like the Gus and Mike backstory, do you think it like doesn't really add to the characters
00:09:51 that were already established in Breaking Bad?
00:09:54 I think in Breaking Bad, the characters are very well established.
00:09:58 And this is just sort of like, it's like ancillary material.
00:10:02 You know, if you want to know a little bit extra, it's like behind the scenes, not behind the scenes, but like extra content, DLC bonus episodes.
00:10:10 The Gus DLC, sure, I understand.
00:10:13 Yeah.
00:10:14 Because like everything, obviously Breaking Bad is made to be contained.
00:10:17 So like every character in there is explained just enough so that they are compelling and you care about them and you care about what they're doing.
00:10:26 And all the while, Walter White is a far more insane protagonist that drives the story forward a lot more quickly and everything is connected to him.
00:10:37 And I think Breaking Bad just makes for a better viewing experience overall.
00:10:43 But do like Better Call Saul, don't kill me, don't kill me everyone.
00:10:47 It's very good.
00:10:49 I like all the cinematography, it's perfectly cinematographized, great acting.
00:10:54 I love Kim Wexler, she's the best character ever.
00:10:57 Which one's Kim Wexler?
00:10:59 The Ponytail Lady.
00:11:01 What does she do?
00:11:02 I do remember her, I kind of am.
00:11:05 She's Jimmy's best friend, lawyer lady.
00:11:09 Okay.
00:11:10 What does she do though?
00:11:12 She does lawyering.
00:11:14 Okay, that's good.
00:11:16 And she's a friend and she's a strong character.
00:11:20 She has sometimes not more protagonism power than Jimmy, but like I feel like you could have a show about Kim.
00:11:30 Probably.
00:11:32 She's got enough like gumption for that.
00:11:35 That's cool.
00:11:36 Okay, okay, okay.
00:11:40 Oh, I'm looking at a weird video of a Pokemon.
00:11:45 That is as usual.
00:11:47 And it's fucked up.
00:11:52 Do you want to hear some great news?
00:11:55 Some great news, yes.
00:11:57 Some great, some incredibly, some incredibly, well you know Ben Hughes, right?
00:12:04 On Twitter.
00:12:06 No.
00:12:07 You will.
00:12:08 He's the Team Eor stared at Idiolops, a prehistoric cesiosaur synapses that lived in southwestern
00:12:16 United States early Paramin period.
00:12:19 Team Eor, which is Team Eor and his six girlfriends.
00:12:23 What is it?
00:12:24 Ruth Powers, Laura Powers, Alith and Taylor, Ruth Powers Jr.
00:12:30 Who's the other two girlfriends?
00:12:33 He's got six girlfriends.
00:12:37 I believe it.
00:12:40 I mean, I'm a big Eor fan and I've been a lifelong, lifelong Team Eor.
00:12:45 So, you know, I get it.
00:12:48 I can't remember the names of these two even more obscure characters than Ruth Powers Jr.
00:12:56 if you can believe it.
00:12:57 They are Simpsons females.
00:12:59 They are Simpsons females.
00:13:01 Yeah, Simpsons females stared in awe at the platyhysterics, a prehistoric Temnospondyl
00:13:10 amphibian with sailbag.
00:13:13 Anyway, the great news is, turns out Team Eor got married on New Year's.
00:13:20 They got married on January 1st, 2023 and now the six girlfriends have become six wives.
00:13:30 Hell yeah, Eor.
00:13:35 I guess I'll get it, Eor, because I saw him posting about Eor and his wives, a.k.a. Team Eor.
00:13:46 And I said, I didn't know they were married and he told me, yeah, they got married on New Year's
00:13:50 and I said, congratulations.
00:13:52 I almost said many happy returns because I know that in Winnie the Pooh, at least in the old Winnie the Pooh,
00:13:59 they say many happy returns to Eor.
00:14:03 I think it's to Eor on his birthday, but it turns out many happy returns is specifically a birthday thing.
00:14:09 You don't just say that on like any happy occasion.
00:14:11 You say it on your birthday, so I didn't say that.
00:14:15 Why is that?
00:14:16 What does it mean?
00:14:17 I hope you'll return to the same date next year.
00:14:21 Yes, I think it basically means I hope you'll have many more birthdays that are happening.
00:14:27 Yeah, if you say that during a wedding.
00:14:29 Yeah, it'd be weird.
00:14:31 So I dodged that bullet.
00:14:33 I wouldn't want to embarrass myself in front of the venues, the Simpsons ninjas, no sexy for me and free guy.
00:14:43 I should draw him some ninjas.
00:14:47 Did you draw him some ninjas or did someone else?
00:14:50 Someone else did.
00:14:51 I can't remember if I, no, I don't think so.
00:14:54 A couple people have.
00:14:56 I kind of would like to just for fun, but also I don't want to.
00:15:03 It would be difficult to not draw sexy, no sexy.
00:15:07 I mean, I would not struggle with that part of it.
00:15:12 I'm saying I would.
00:15:14 I would just struggle with just motivating myself to do anything part of it.
00:15:23 Bro.
00:15:26 That's so relate.
00:15:28 That's so relatable.
00:15:29 Artist problems.
00:15:30 Look at the blank page.
00:15:32 Me and where SpongeBob looks at the blank page and it has the big fancy the written on it.
00:15:37 At least he wrote a the.
00:15:39 Yeah.
00:15:40 At least he wrote a big.
00:15:41 Well, what have I ever done?
00:15:45 But yeah, then it's like January, it's cold.
00:15:49 I could have started the new year being like hitting the ground running and being like, okay, it's time to work.
00:15:54 But it's cold and it's, I don't want to.
00:15:57 I'm just, I'm not going to do that.
00:15:59 I'm going to binge medical soil till it's warm.
00:16:02 Yeah.
00:16:03 Then I can come out of my cocoon.
00:16:05 I said that I was going to have that stuff done by the end of the year and it's two weeks into the new year and it's not done.
00:16:16 I, it's, you know, that's have no make no excuses.
00:16:21 But yesterday I did work on it some more and you know, it's it's coming along and it's just really, I think I've complained about this before.
00:16:29 So I won't go into it too long.
00:16:30 But you know, it's I'm just, I'm just literally like taking blocks of text and moving them around just trying to make them fit on as few pages as possible.
00:16:37 And it's just very tedious and it's very dull work and I don't like it.
00:16:42 And I've been procrastinating like the name of the podcast and I've been playing Noida again.
00:16:49 I've fallen back into my old ways of playing Noida, which is a terrible thing.
00:16:53 Noida is a bad game for me.
00:16:55 It's a good game for you, the listener, and you should try it and play it.
00:16:58 But for me, it's bad because I understand it too well and it's just like playing solitaire now.
00:17:04 It's just, it's just like playing anything.
00:17:07 Yeah.
00:17:08 It's just, it's just going through emotions.
00:17:11 I mean, solitaire can be fun, even if you know how to do it.
00:17:14 Well, I don't, well, I don't play it.
00:17:16 I don't actually know how to do it.
00:17:19 But sure, it's fun.
00:17:22 It's fun, I guess, but it's ultimately a waste of time.
00:17:25 It's not that bad.
00:17:26 I mean, most things are, if they're like a video game experience, it's just like whatever.
00:17:31 I mean, I've been doing that.
00:17:32 You're right.
00:17:33 I play like Picross on like a random Picross generator and I've like, I fail over and over again.
00:17:40 I, it's just like, well, I mean, I'm spent, I'm sitting here.
00:17:44 Like, what am I actually doing?
00:17:45 I'm sitting here listening to something and clicking cubes, clicking squares.
00:17:52 Clicking cubes, like an addict.
00:17:55 And I'm like, and I'm like, oh, really, I should be doing some other game, you know, a better game.
00:18:01 But then, like, every game is just clicking squares.
00:18:07 When you get right down to it, when you get right down to it, it's true.
00:18:12 It's true.
00:18:13 It doesn't really matter.
00:18:14 Like if, like, there's this, I don't know, compulsion, this feeling of like worthiness,
00:18:23 like you need your time to be filled with the best shit, like the absolute best stuff ever.
00:18:30 Yeah.
00:18:31 And I have all of these games like, oh, I could, I could play that game again.
00:18:34 I could be experiencing the classics, the canon, the masterpieces.
00:18:37 I know.
00:18:38 I could go to the, oh, criterion collection.
00:18:40 Let's see what they got.
00:18:41 I could be, why did I waste, man, in the time I've spent playing Noida, I could have played The Last of Us,
00:18:46 the only, the only video game to tell a story in ever.
00:18:52 That wasn't, I was an all right video game.
00:18:55 I enjoyed that one.
00:18:57 Yeah.
00:18:58 I could have played it like 200 times.
00:19:02 But then, but then I go back to like, oh, I'm just going to hop on RuneScape and click some, some coal or get some coal for like an hour or three.
00:19:12 And I'm like, wow, I could have done it other games, but I don't know.
00:19:16 Do I need to worry about that?
00:19:18 You could have been mining that coal in real life.
00:19:21 You could have, you could have that much real coal.
00:19:24 Yeah.
00:19:25 We've got an energy crisis right now.
00:19:26 There's the fuel prices through the roof.
00:19:28 I just need to go into like the mines and get some free coal.
00:19:31 What we have give is a crisis of democracy.
00:19:34 Instead of playing video games, you could have gone to Ukraine and defended democracy against the East, against the insidious Orient.
00:19:42 What do you have to say for yourself?
00:19:46 They're transphobic.
00:19:48 They wouldn't give me a gun.
00:19:49 That's true.
00:19:50 That's true.
00:19:51 All right.
00:19:52 You know what?
00:19:53 You got a better excuse than I do.
00:19:55 There's, for me, I have no good reason to not go over there and join the Azov Battalion.
00:20:00 Specifically them.
00:20:03 It's the only one I've heard of.
00:20:05 So yeah, I just signed, I just, I checked the box on that one on my sign up sheet.
00:20:10 I mean, you are a grizzled veteran.
00:20:12 You know, you have all the qualities.
00:20:14 Yeah, I think so.
00:20:16 I mean, I'm Slavic.
00:20:17 I'll fit right in.
00:20:19 I'll just, I'll just change the spelling of my name.
00:20:22 Just change the I to a Y.
00:20:24 The PCP from the fucking trenches.
00:20:27 Radcon 5, live from Keef.
00:20:30 We're being, we're being shelled.
00:20:34 Oh yeah, it's Keef, all right.
00:20:36 Keef's mostly all right.
00:20:38 Oh good.
00:20:39 We should go to the front lines.
00:20:40 We should get the real action shots.
00:20:42 Yeah, we should do it.
00:20:44 We should get shelled.
00:20:45 It'd be like Redcon arena.
00:20:46 We do get shelled.
00:20:47 Redcon's real arena, but in real life with real guns.
00:20:50 Oh God.
00:20:51 Yes.
00:20:52 We get the GoPro's back.
00:20:55 Finally, finally, these GoPro's are paying for themselves.
00:21:00 Did you see, I have two, now I have two things.
00:21:04 Did you see like the Miss Universe pageant?
00:21:07 Did you see the Ukraine Miss Universe?
00:21:09 I don't know.
00:21:10 I've never watched Miss Anything.
00:21:12 Okay.
00:21:13 Well, the Miss Universe pageant, I guess, was this week.
00:21:15 And I saw some clips of some, there was one thing where they all just came out on stage
00:21:20 wearing this huge elaborate like costume that like represented their country
00:21:25 and America's was fucking stupid.
00:21:28 Was it a burger?
00:21:30 No, it was the moon.
00:21:33 Well, because they went to it.
00:21:35 I don't know.
00:21:36 I don't know if it's, is this supposed to be like a dig at Russia?
00:21:39 Like how we beat you to the moon idiots?
00:21:42 Because I don't like, what about America?
00:21:45 Why would they be like, oh yeah, America, hmm, it's 2023.
00:21:48 What has America done?
00:21:49 Well, we went to the moon.
00:21:51 That's pretty good.
00:21:53 It was a while ago, but yeah.
00:21:55 The flag's still there as far as I know.
00:21:57 Probably.
00:21:58 Has another like landing of a human person taken place on the moon since the first one?
00:22:05 Well, a bunch of, I think America has been to the moon a bunch of times.
00:22:09 But like, as like a landing expedition.
00:22:13 Because that's more, that's more confusing than like a satellite or like a little robot collecting samples or whatever.
00:22:21 I, I want to say I think so.
00:22:24 There's been a few.
00:22:27 Hang on.
00:22:29 But anyway, I just bring it up because Miss Ukraine just looked so fucking awesome.
00:22:37 I'm going to try to get pictures.
00:22:42 Yeah.
00:22:43 Here I find a freaking picture of this goddamn bullshit.
00:22:47 Oh, it's contra points.
00:22:49 It kind of does look like contra points.
00:22:51 You know what?
00:22:53 Oh, this is a contra points like, like costume in a video.
00:22:59 Yeah, exactly what she would wear.
00:23:02 The Odessa Journal reported on it.
00:23:06 She got a sword this school.
00:23:08 She's the Archangel Michael or she's dressed like the Archangel Michael.
00:23:12 She looks like some of those like.
00:23:14 I'm sorry.
00:23:15 Powerful Alliance priests in World of Warcraft.
00:23:19 Yeah, it's a bit, it's a bit, it's a bit, it's a bit 40k.
00:23:23 It's a bit Warhammer 40k looking.
00:23:26 She looks, she looks like a sister of battle who would be leading like a space marine battalion or something.
00:23:33 I mean, I'm sorry, but like it's, it rules.
00:23:36 It's awesome.
00:23:38 It's my aesthetic.
00:23:40 I like it.
00:23:41 Yeah.
00:23:42 Now I'm just imagining Miss America, like just wearing like a sphere of the moon with her head popping out the top.
00:23:48 Well, let me try.
00:23:49 Is that what it looked like?
00:23:50 No.
00:23:51 Because that should have been, that should have been it.
00:23:53 She should have rolled on to stage.
00:23:55 No, it looked like a freaking this for some reason is what they decided to go with.
00:24:02 I'm sure that I'm sure.
00:24:03 Oh, freaking Miss El Salvador look was a Bitcoin, which is like even worse.
00:24:08 So like in terms of like cringy costumes.
00:24:12 Oh my God, it's she's mega mind.
00:24:16 Yeah.
00:24:19 Yeah, there's Miss USA.
00:24:21 Here's Miss El Salvador on the left.
00:24:23 I don't know what country that is on the right.
00:24:27 You know, kind of funny.
00:24:29 It's it's it's it's a it's a mega punks giant brain.
00:24:35 You mean the moon?
00:24:36 The moon.
00:24:37 It's just so it's a very funny bulbous thing on the top of the head.
00:24:41 I'm I'm think it's got to be like a weird like fuck Russia thing.
00:24:46 Why?
00:24:47 Who fucking cares about the moon?
00:24:49 Yeah.
00:24:51 The Ukraine one, the lady comes out and the announcers.
00:24:55 Yeah, it's about like, you know, like the Archangel Michael is like aiding them in the in the fight, right?
00:25:01 Like references to their fight their fight their battle.
00:25:04 So it's like Russia.
00:25:08 And I mean, frankly, just made me think that maybe the Russians were right.
00:25:13 Maybe Ukraine's got to go if they're if they're going to if they're going to be a little pussy about it.
00:25:20 I'm sorry.
00:25:22 It's not true.
00:25:23 It's not what I actually thought.
00:25:26 I just like the costume.
00:25:27 All right.
00:25:28 She looks like she looks like the fucking alien from American dead.
00:25:36 Yeah, looks so fucking silly.
00:25:38 It does.
00:25:39 This looks like a giant, especially from from the straight ahead angle.
00:25:43 Yeah.
00:25:44 It looks like she's got a big gray head.
00:25:47 Fucking fucking good.
00:25:49 Good for her.
00:25:51 Who gives the best head?
00:25:53 It's it's her.
00:25:54 The moon.
00:25:55 The moon does.
00:25:58 Well, how did I even get on this subject of this moon lady?
00:26:02 You brought it up.
00:26:03 Oh, we were talking about Redcon 5 and Redcon 5 live live from life from Donbass or whatever.
00:26:10 Yeah.
00:26:11 Yeah.
00:26:16 If we go if we get costumes like this, then it'll be good.
00:26:20 That'll be part of the stretch goal for the Kickstarter.
00:26:23 I get the sword and wings and I fly over and go.
00:26:28 I don't want to go into too much detail, but did you see what did you see what Nate said in the in the PCP all business chat?
00:26:37 Is the the dojin almost finished?
00:26:40 Is that what he said?
00:26:41 Well, the dojin is is almost finished.
00:26:44 And also the OVA is like almost finished.
00:26:47 Oh, yes, the OVA.
00:26:48 That's what I meant.
00:26:49 Yeah.
00:26:50 Yeah.
00:26:51 Yeah.
00:26:52 It's like I'm not going to give like a hard date or anything, but it's like mostly done.
00:26:57 So like we might be releasing that in maybe the next couple weeks.
00:27:01 Perhaps.
00:27:02 Hell yeah.
00:27:03 I'll make you imagine.
00:27:04 Watch it.
00:27:05 Can you?
00:27:06 Can you?
00:27:07 Yeah, I don't I'm a little scared.
00:27:08 I might not be actually able to watch it myself, but oh well.
00:27:13 Cringe.
00:27:14 Cringe.
00:27:15 It'll be cringe.
00:27:16 It'll be cringe.
00:27:17 It'll be cringe.
00:27:18 And you know what?
00:27:19 We deliver eventually.
00:27:20 We deliver eventually.
00:27:22 It's I it's it's and then we get our Radcon money finally.
00:27:29 Yeah.
00:27:30 Yeah.
00:27:31 So that'll be good.
00:27:33 Oh, make sure to buy it like a business expense thing so I can take it off my taxes for this
00:27:39 year.
00:27:40 Like what?
00:27:41 I don't know because if I'm going to get a big lump sum of Radcon money, I need like
00:27:47 something to offset it.
00:27:48 I need to.
00:27:49 You do?
00:27:50 Well, they're going to take me with taxes.
00:27:52 They're going to tax me.
00:27:53 I don't want to be taxed.
00:27:54 Put it.
00:27:55 That's so scary.
00:27:56 My money is going to go away.
00:27:57 I need to buy like a like a cool thing that I'm going to buy a car.
00:28:04 You're absolutely right.
00:28:05 When you get whenever when you get paid, you go like, oh shit, I can't I can't let them
00:28:11 tax me.
00:28:12 I got to spend it.
00:28:13 I got to spend it immediately.
00:28:14 I got to get rid of it.
00:28:15 That's the thing.
00:28:17 When you get paid, you got to make sure you get rid of the money right away, lest you
00:28:22 be taxed on it.
00:28:23 I mean, it's true.
00:28:24 I'm not going to get rid of all of it.
00:28:26 I just want to get under the threshold because then I'll have like things that I, you know,
00:28:31 if I need things, I should buy them.
00:28:33 I mean, yeah, if you need to buy things for no reason.
00:28:36 That's silly.
00:28:37 That's speaking of speaking of buying things for no reason.
00:28:41 I did.
00:28:43 Here, a Botster commission.
00:28:44 Oh, yeah.
00:28:46 It looked really good.
00:28:48 It's the Clarissa Gunsmoke 3D experience.
00:28:50 Let me get it.
00:28:52 Yes.
00:28:53 Yeah.
00:28:54 Let's show that.
00:28:55 I wanted to get one of these, but they always sell out so quick.
00:28:58 Oh, does she have have limited slots?
00:29:01 She has limited slots like every month she takes on like four and I keep I kept missing
00:29:06 it over and over again.
00:29:07 I would DM her.
00:29:08 She said, oh, just too late.
00:29:10 Finally, this time, yeah, I managed to get in.
00:29:13 Actually, she let me in because she was feeling pity on me.
00:29:18 Well, take what you can get.
00:29:20 I guess.
00:29:21 Yeah, but it was it's great.
00:29:23 It does look it does look really good.
00:29:26 Do you I'm kind of curious.
00:29:30 Do you mind talking about like how much it costs?
00:29:34 I mean, her prices are public when she puts the thing.
00:29:39 It's like 500 bucks for this animation.
00:29:44 Yeah.
00:29:45 You can get just the model, which is cheaper, but I wanted the I wanted the
00:29:49 shooty gun. I wanted the cool animation.
00:29:52 OK, I see.
00:29:53 You can pay even more to get like a more elaborate animation.
00:29:56 Yeah, like a simple one.
00:29:58 So this was the simple animation.
00:30:00 OK, yeah, still quite right.
00:30:02 Like really nice.
00:30:03 I mean, yeah, animating.
00:30:05 Yeah.
00:30:07 I see you could like pay extra for like a game ready like source files.
00:30:13 What is that if you if you wanted to get the model with like
00:30:18 everything rigged because to animate it, you've got to rig it anyway.
00:30:22 Yeah. So I mean, I feel like she's got the model rigged, right?
00:30:27 Like she had to have made it to make the animation.
00:30:29 Yeah. Yeah.
00:30:31 So like if I if I wanted to turn it into a game, I would need to.
00:30:35 I didn't pay for that extra bit just because I don't have like plans
00:30:39 or really the know how to make a video game.
00:30:45 All by myself, that model.
00:30:48 I do like the idea, though, it would be cool to have a little
00:30:51 Clarissa like shoot game.
00:30:52 I kind of assumed that like somewhere in your head, you were like
00:30:58 if it may be not necessarily going to be like, OK, this is for a game,
00:31:03 like I'm planning a game, but you must have thought like I could put this in a game.
00:31:07 I did think it for a while.
00:31:09 It's just a little it was like some how much extra was it for the game ready?
00:31:14 It's like it's like two hundred bucks or it's like two hundred ninety.
00:31:17 I think it's two hundred ninety.
00:31:18 And I was just wondering, I don't really know what goes into it,
00:31:22 but it made me wonder, like, is it is it like more work to like
00:31:26 make them quote unquote game ready?
00:31:28 Like this.
00:31:29 Do they does it have to do something to the or is it just like
00:31:32 for three hundred dollars, she'll she'll hand over the file.
00:31:35 She already has law.
00:31:37 I I'm not sure.
00:31:39 Yeah.
00:31:41 I'm hoping that in the future, I can say, hey, can I if I need to,
00:31:45 like I can say, could I pay for the the file if that's OK?
00:31:50 Because if she I assume it is some other work.
00:31:54 I wouldn't be maybe if I like inverse kinematics or like various other things.
00:31:58 I don't even know whether that's necessary,
00:32:00 but like game ready means drag and drop and it's working.
00:32:04 So probably something.
00:32:06 I mean, I don't really know how to use 3D model data.
00:32:09 So I have no I really have no I have no idea what would what goes into like it.
00:32:15 I mean, I assume.
00:32:17 I mean, she has something.
00:32:19 She has some model and some rigging.
00:32:21 She must have it in order to have made this animation.
00:32:24 And maybe it might be like incomplete.
00:32:27 Uh, uh, maybe I don't know.
00:32:31 I don't know what would be different about a quote unquote game ready version.
00:32:38 Yeah, I guess I'll have to ask.
00:32:41 I was I was just curious.
00:32:42 I was just curious about that because I saw that option and I was like, damn,
00:32:45 three hundred three hundred dollars just to like.
00:32:49 I mean, I mean, I guess I don't know.
00:32:51 I thought the analogy I thought of was like,
00:32:54 what if you what if you commissioned like an artist to draw a art for you?
00:32:58 And then I don't know.
00:33:00 They were like, well, for some extra money, I'll give you the like
00:33:05 Photoshop, you know, layer files and stuff.
00:33:10 Like sometimes people do that.
00:33:12 I guess I guess I'm going to do that.
00:33:14 Um, yeah, I don't know.
00:33:17 I think I think a lot of it could be that if you have a game ready version.
00:33:23 Then that's more than just a cool animation and like an image
00:33:28 that has been made for you.
00:33:29 It is work that you can then go on to make money with if you build a game around it.
00:33:34 Yeah. So it's like more industry, like, oh, I've I've been commissioned
00:33:39 to make a product for like an asset for your game,
00:33:43 which is different from making a little video file.
00:33:47 I believe that there is probably more stuff that's involved.
00:33:53 In that, like I say, I don't really know how to do any of this stuff.
00:33:59 But the animation just looks really good.
00:34:02 Yes, exactly.
00:34:04 I wanted the little the little pixelated smoke cloud.
00:34:10 The most with the squares.
00:34:13 Yeah, yeah, I just I just.
00:34:19 Boss boss is pretty good at what she does.
00:34:23 She like she like got the.
00:34:28 Oh, she got like noticed or something.
00:34:29 Is she big because of the the the the the the bloodborne stuff, the PSX bloodborne?
00:34:36 I yes, I think she made PSX bloodborne as a joke.
00:34:41 Well, not as a joke, just as a little fun thing.
00:34:43 And then it turned into a big thing.
00:34:45 Yeah.
00:34:46 And she posted like dev updates on our Twitter.
00:34:49 That grew.
00:34:51 Just because, oh, my God, bloodborne, but like PS1.
00:34:54 That's I mean, it does it does look good.
00:34:56 It does look good.
00:34:58 And then more recently, she's started working on a race here.
00:35:02 Bloodborne cart, which is a little occasionally she'll drop a new like
00:35:08 racer and it'll be like, oh, it's it's the crow ladies.
00:35:11 I lean the crow.
00:35:12 The latest one.
00:35:14 I got Gerriman, you got the the guy with the.
00:35:18 It makes his face.
00:35:20 With the cage on his head, you know, that guy.
00:35:23 I mean, is it like blood wig?
00:35:25 Yeah, Nicolash, the scholar or something like that, the insane boy.
00:35:29 Yes, the guy who runs away.
00:35:32 Yeah.
00:35:33 I I was looking at I was looking at a video of bloodborne cart
00:35:39 and I was watching your little racer like turn right, turn left, whatever.
00:35:43 And I was thinking, you know, it has such it has such crunchy pixel, right?
00:35:50 Like these are these are polygonal models, but they are they are they are
00:35:54 displaying in such crisp pixelated.
00:35:59 You know what I'm talking about?
00:36:03 Well, you mean fidelity is too high for.
00:36:06 No, no, no, this is this.
00:36:09 I mean, well, I just mean, what do I mean?
00:36:15 It's the way you're looking at the carts and they're crunchy and crispy.
00:36:18 They're they're crunchy and crispy.
00:36:21 How do I even explain what what I'm seeing?
00:36:24 It's like, I don't know, man, you can just see the pixels, you can just see the pixels.
00:36:31 Yeah, you can.
00:36:32 That's the idea is I know, I know, I know.
00:36:34 But like, but the the poly the polygonal model is is built on math, right?
00:36:41 So like like the polygon is like theoretically perfect.
00:36:46 Yes, just a it's two points in between them.
00:36:50 What? Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:36:51 So what I'm saying is like to achieve that kind of like pixel display, like that pixel.
00:37:00 Is it like, is that what's called a shader?
00:37:03 Is like, do you apply a shader to a model in order to render it in a way
00:37:08 that is like sort of crunched down into pixels
00:37:12 that match a certain a certain resolution or something like that?
00:37:15 Do you know what I'm talking about?
00:37:16 I mean, I'm not I'm not sure because if you had an example image,
00:37:21 I could tell you exactly what it is.
00:37:23 But I think there are a few shaders going on with the footage.
00:37:27 Sometimes she has like a CRT like filter that makes it look like
00:37:31 it's on a CRT, I think the textures she uses are very low res anyway.
00:37:36 So they just have pixels in them because that's how big they are.
00:37:39 Yeah. And the you know, low polygon count means there'll be hard edges.
00:37:44 And I assume if you're talking about like how the edges look,
00:37:49 they would be aliased instead of anti aliased.
00:37:52 They would be you draw a diagonal line.
00:37:55 And yeah, I guess I guess you would use some shader to like
00:37:58 to have like the resolution, the resolution of the final image be like
00:38:02 two forty by four eighty or whatever, rather than ten eighty P.
00:38:07 I kept, you know, it then blown up when I was.
00:38:13 I guess what I'm saying is when I was making Phantom's Revenge,
00:38:18 now I'm a I'm a hack and I didn't know what I was doing.
00:38:22 And I know there must have been an easier way to do this.
00:38:26 I pretty much just fucked this up completely.
00:38:29 I could have simply I'm sure there would have been a way to just
00:38:34 have the window, have the game window itself
00:38:38 be displaying a pretty like lower resolution image
00:38:44 in what do you call it, a lower resolution image
00:38:49 just at a higher like the
00:38:53 size to just like kind of blow up a low resolution pixel image.
00:38:57 I didn't do that.
00:38:59 I just I pretty much just had everything.
00:39:03 I just multiple everything's pixel count.
00:39:05 I just multiplied by three.
00:39:07 You know what I mean?
00:39:09 So like every every pixel in the game is like is actually three pixels.
00:39:13 Oh, and I like manually like, yes, bigger.
00:39:16 Yes, I just manually drew everything bigger.
00:39:18 I multiplied the size of everything.
00:39:20 And I just tried to make sure that everything's positioning
00:39:24 at all times was a multiple of three so that there wouldn't be any like.
00:39:28 You know, you wouldn't see any single pixels,
00:39:31 like only half overlaid over each other, like like a pixel mismatch.
00:39:36 Yeah, I think there are ways to do that, but I don't know them.
00:39:40 I'm just imagining that it must be a real technical challenge
00:39:42 to accomplish that with polygons.
00:39:46 Potentially, yeah, I think it's.
00:39:49 Relatively simple.
00:39:51 I mean, a lot of they're probably are just methods to do it.
00:39:55 I think in a lot of modern video game development things, tools,
00:40:00 they assume that you want to make Assassin's Creed.
00:40:03 So like every like, there's a lot of things that are just default.
00:40:07 Like, oh, easy drag and drop like lighting.
00:40:11 Oh, it's sunshine and shadows, dynamic shadows.
00:40:13 You want that, right?
00:40:14 Yeah, if you're trying to make a polygonal PS1 style game, you don't want that.
00:40:19 So, yeah, there's there's a lot of.
00:40:23 Not a lot, but like a bit of finicky,
00:40:26 like programming around what the the the tools would
00:40:31 were expecting for Pumpkin Alley, because it's we wanted it to be like
00:40:35 lower fidelity PS2, you know, experience.
00:40:40 And they wanted to have like lens flares and they didn't put that in.
00:40:44 But you know what I mean?
00:40:46 Modern game stuff is just very easy to click.
00:40:49 Yeah, drag and drop, we call it.
00:40:53 Is it is it shaders?
00:40:54 Am I is shaders the word for like modules?
00:40:59 Just yeah, just stuff that you can just like put in the game
00:41:01 and it's already sort of pre made and has a certain behavior to it.
00:41:05 Pre fab or an asset. I don't know. Yeah, pre.
00:41:08 Oh, do you know, do you know, Tio?
00:41:12 Yeah. Did you see Tio's like the gif of his game?
00:41:18 And like the lighting system that he's got for his sort of for his sort of.
00:41:25 What's the word?
00:41:25 It's that like Maple Leaf, Metroidvania, anime girl.
00:41:31 He has he has a game that he's building that kind of looks like Momodora.
00:41:35 And he posts this was maybe two or three weeks ago.
00:41:40 Well, his personal kind of Tio the creator and then his work account is Tio devs here.
00:41:46 Look at this.
00:41:47 Look at this like lighting system that he built.
00:41:51 And it moves around and looks all crazy and shit.
00:41:56 Animated the light emulated day night cycle.
00:41:59 Yeah. So. Yeah, that's definitely would be a shader.
00:42:05 Yeah. How do they?
00:42:09 Yeah, how do they do that?
00:42:11 I guess these 2D things aren't as 2D or maybe it's like a value thing.
00:42:18 Like it checks the value of the pixel and then decides whether there's like a finds the edge.
00:42:26 I don't know. I don't know. That's cool.
00:42:29 It's pretty pretty cool looking, I thought.
00:42:33 Yeah.
00:42:34 Uh, that's a yeah, I don't know.
00:42:39 I don't know what a shader is, LaMau.
00:42:43 But I think I assume they're involved in getting a game to look the way you want it to look.
00:42:48 That's all. Yeah, like like you've got like models and like
00:42:54 stuff, got 3D stuff.
00:42:56 You got 2D plane stuff with images on it.
00:43:00 Shaders are like on top of something.
00:43:03 You can apply it to make it look certain ways.
00:43:07 That's that's my basic understanding of a shader.
00:43:11 Is that you're it's like a thing you add to something.
00:43:15 Yeah, I mean, I know I'm familiar with the concept of like a like
00:43:22 like what would you call it in like Photoshop, like a a correction layer.
00:43:28 I imagine a shader as like a correction layer that you apply over
00:43:32 an asset as it's being drawn on the screen that like adjusts the way that it's drawn.
00:43:38 Yeah, yeah.
00:43:40 But it can interact with game code.
00:43:43 So like when like you can have like a shader react to something based on a player input
00:43:49 or like a game state or whatever, you know, you can like animate a shader.
00:43:55 I think punk's fire breath is like it's a 3D model of a fire that wobbles
00:44:02 and grows and it's like a shader thing.
00:44:05 I didn't really understand it because it's too complex.
00:44:10 Charlie handled that.
00:44:11 Yeah, all according with him.
00:44:14 So I'm stupid, you see.
00:44:17 I looked over his shoulder a lot and I'd be like, hmm, yeah, I think I get it.
00:44:21 And I really don't. But I think I get it now.
00:44:25 It's like it's like, hmm, a Boolean interesting.
00:44:30 A Boo, a Boolean.
00:44:31 Yeah, it's like nodding, nodding along like, yes, I I I understand shaders now.
00:44:39 It's like he's just like tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, and then and then bam,
00:44:42 look, the game works and you go, ah, yes, I see.
00:44:45 Yes, makes I could have I could have done that, I think.
00:44:49 Yes. Yeah.
00:44:51 I got you. I got you.
00:44:54 I don't know.
00:44:56 That's just what I noticed the most looking at a bloodborne cart
00:45:01 is just how crispy the pixels are and like, hmm, how they how they do that.
00:45:06 How do they do that?
00:45:08 They probably have like if you go through their dev threads,
00:45:12 they probably explain like early on how they approach
00:45:16 all those things because that's they they get into like some amount of detail.
00:45:20 Like, oh, this week I worked on this thing, blah, blah, blah, that.
00:45:23 Is it just Botster or is it like a team?
00:45:27 It's just so she she she was in like the the gaming industry
00:45:31 is like working on indie games and stuff, animated for other people.
00:45:35 And then she's like, fuck it.
00:45:37 I hate the industry.
00:45:38 I'm going to do my own thing. Interesting.
00:45:41 I didn't know that.
00:45:42 That's pretty cool. And she made bloodborne PSX.
00:45:46 Did she work on any games I would have heard of?
00:45:49 I don't know, actually.
00:45:52 She made a game that I haven't played yet.
00:45:54 It's it was in one of the bundles like for Palestinian relief or something.
00:46:02 And it's like I should get around to playing that.
00:46:07 She's it's like a first like indie project that was completed.
00:46:12 Arceus Arceus, but not the Pokemon.
00:46:16 I think it's something else.
00:46:17 The game starts with an A. OK.
00:46:20 All right, did I talk about the guy at the party
00:46:25 who told me I should pitch Clarissa Gunsmoke to Adult Swim?
00:46:30 Did I talk about this all the role already on the show?
00:46:32 That does not ring a bell.
00:46:33 So I'm going to say no, I don't think so.
00:46:36 OK, so the Christmas Eve party,
00:46:39 one of my dad's friends.
00:46:40 I mean, I know him, so I guess we're also friends.
00:46:46 He's seen my comic before.
00:46:48 I showed him before and he's like, you should really
00:46:50 like I can get you in contact with like some people.
00:46:53 We can work it out.
00:46:55 And I'm like, I don't I can I assume you know some stuff.
00:46:58 I mean, you definitely know more than me about the industry.
00:47:01 Who is this person?
00:47:03 It's just a guy.
00:47:04 He's in my dad's band.
00:47:07 Played. He was the bassist in the when I did that gig.
00:47:12 Yeah, OK.
00:47:13 So he's like he works in TV.
00:47:17 He does things that I not entirely show what he does.
00:47:21 But like that's cool.
00:47:23 You know, that's something. Sure.
00:47:25 Maybe I can utilize his his connections.
00:47:28 And he was talking about the Rick and Morty people.
00:47:31 It's like you could you could put this to Adult Swim.
00:47:34 Oh, Rick and Morty, there's a show that's doing well
00:47:39 and is not seeing any difficulties at the moment.
00:47:43 Yeah, but you know, whatever.
00:47:45 Sure, sure, sure, whatever.
00:47:47 So it's like it sounds silly.
00:47:50 But maybe maybe I could like make a pitch
00:47:54 for Clarissa Gunsmoke, the animated series.
00:47:57 Did you see I could go to fucking I could fucking fly to LA
00:48:02 and walk around and put it under someone's nose and say, look,
00:48:07 look, animated.
00:48:10 Did you see Cheezy's video about how to pitch your show to Adult Swim?
00:48:15 I did. I forgot what it what it said.
00:48:18 The I don't want to spoil it, but I will.
00:48:24 It's a funny video.
00:48:25 It's about. Well, it's about that they there was this.
00:48:30 There was this live stream that you could basically call into
00:48:35 and you could pitch your show to these two guys.
00:48:39 And I think one show one show eventually did sort of get picked up
00:48:43 and like, I don't know if it was has been produced yet,
00:48:45 but there was one show that seemed like it actually worked out somewhat.
00:48:50 But anyway, the long and short of it is they had this live stream show
00:48:54 where you could pitch your show to them and they would give you feedback on it.
00:48:57 And what's his name?
00:48:58 Rebel Taxi did it like once or twice.
00:49:03 And the Rebel Taxi's show is bad and his work is bad
00:49:08 and his characters and his concepts are bad.
00:49:11 So it didn't work.
00:49:15 Long and short of it is the show doesn't exist anymore.
00:49:17 The show has been canceled and you can no longer do this.
00:49:20 Lamal. Yeah, I mean, I imagine.
00:49:23 Like free and open access to anyone who wants to try
00:49:27 is always going to be a little harder to get like noticed.
00:49:32 Then then like going through like, oh, I know a guy who knows a guy.
00:49:36 Maybe this guy does know a guy. I don't know.
00:49:40 He just put it in my head like you should make Clarissa Gunsmoke animated series.
00:49:44 You know, you're working on this comic.
00:49:45 Looks great, but you should make it like you should put it to Adult Swim.
00:49:48 I'm like, what? Really?
00:49:52 I mean, it would be cool.
00:49:54 Sure, it would be cool.
00:49:55 Look, I don't want to be a hater.
00:49:56 I'm not trying to be a hater, but like, don't you work for that studio
00:50:00 that's like trying to get their animated series produced?
00:50:03 Like, oh, yeah, I'm going to talk to them for hard, right?
00:50:07 It is pretty hard.
00:50:08 Yeah, it's
00:50:13 but like, I don't know, I've got cool characters.
00:50:16 What if what if I was better than everyone?
00:50:18 What if I'm actually the best and I just didn't I just didn't believe in myself until now?
00:50:25 What if Clarissa Gunsmoke is exactly what they want?
00:50:28 Well, she shoots people they day.
00:50:31 You can't put that on like CBBC.
00:50:34 Can't you?
00:50:37 I.
00:50:39 I mean.
00:50:41 I mean, yeah, hey, do it, hey, do it.
00:50:45 Oh, I'm going to I'm going to try and let me know what happens.
00:50:48 I guess I'm going to get a little pitch together.
00:50:50 I'm going to like, OK, figure out how to make it into like a appealing
00:50:55 little story with a synopsis and a characters.
00:51:00 I mean, I'm going to make a little thing and I'm going to I'm going to
00:51:03 go to LA, I guess.
00:51:05 I don't know who are you going to pitch it to?
00:51:08 Well, that's why I want to talk to this this guy again,
00:51:11 because he says we can we can workshop some ideas of how to like get it seen.
00:51:14 I'm like, all right, you know more than me on that.
00:51:17 So I'll meet up with him.
00:51:19 I mean, I wonder.
00:51:21 Yeah, I wonder who this who this guy knows and what.
00:51:27 Because he's done he's done very he talks about doing like all sorts
00:51:32 of little things and it's like it's it seems like really cool.
00:51:40 But I don't know how like connected he is.
00:51:42 But I can't like I can't know until I figure it out, I guess.
00:51:48 He doesn't seem like a liar.
00:51:49 He doesn't seem like a jokester.
00:51:54 I don't know. It's kind of.
00:51:56 But it's sort of like a natural thing to exaggerate.
00:52:00 It's kind of it's kind of a big claim to be like,
00:52:02 I know someone at Adult Swim, I can get you your pitch.
00:52:05 He didn't say that adult swim. OK, he didn't say that. OK.
00:52:08 He says he knows like people who could like help bring it into get seen
00:52:15 seen by somebody who would pick it up.
00:52:16 And he said I'll swim would like it because he likes Rick and Marty, I think.
00:52:22 I mean, who doesn't?
00:52:24 Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess I don't know.
00:52:28 I guess that could mean any number of things.
00:52:30 So I don't know. I'm curious.
00:52:33 It's it's something I'm going to I'm going to see what happens.
00:52:37 Oh, because of the moment, I've been like, oh, I got to draw
00:52:40 should have not been talking to my microphone.
00:52:44 Oh, wow, so loud.
00:52:46 I have not been like really drawing any more Clarissa gun smoke,
00:52:50 even though I said I should. Oh, no, one to two.
00:52:53 And I'm like, oh, come on.
00:52:55 One more panel.
00:52:57 Come on, come on.
00:53:01 I'll do it. I'll do it.
00:53:03 Come on.
00:53:04 I think once the once there's more sunshine,
00:53:07 once I can go outside and feel the sun blast onto my face,
00:53:10 and I'll like get all that photosynthesis.
00:53:14 Yeah, that's what I need.
00:53:16 I need sunshine and rainbows, and then I can feel OK.
00:53:19 And then I can draw.
00:53:21 But in the meantime,
00:53:22 why not follow up this this idea?
00:53:26 What if I what if what if I?
00:53:29 What if Clarissa guns go smoke becomes bigger than Rick and Morty?
00:53:33 Well, then, huh?
00:53:34 Well,
00:53:36 um, then I'll be I'll be fucking I'll be a I'll be eaten crow.
00:53:42 I'll be I'll have my you'll you'll rub it in my face and you'll say,
00:53:47 I told you, Ben, you said I could never do it.
00:53:49 And I said, no, I didn't.
00:53:50 I was careful not to say that.
00:53:52 And you'll say, yes, you did.
00:53:54 And then I'll just crush you.
00:53:55 But it's my boots.
00:53:58 Yeah.
00:54:00 Tired of the train tracks.
00:54:01 Well, somebody had to do it.
00:54:07 Yeah, let me know.
00:54:08 I'm curious to hear how curious to hear what happens with that.
00:54:11 That's interesting.
00:54:14 I'm watching a very interesting.
00:54:15 Look at this.
00:54:17 Look at look at this gift.
00:54:18 Look at this video.
00:54:20 Look at these shaders.
00:54:21 Talk about crunchy pixels.
00:54:23 Oh, I saw this.
00:54:24 Oh, this looks pretty.
00:54:25 I'm I'm transfixed by it.
00:54:27 This is like a first glance.
00:54:30 This is reminded me of like the town with no name, the old DOS game.
00:54:35 I'm not familiar.
00:54:37 It's like a a.
00:54:40 Choose your own adventure kind of where you walk into a Western town
00:54:44 and it's on DOS and it's like made by some guy.
00:54:49 Maybe as a project or just for fun, very odd obscure game.
00:54:54 But you go in there and you have to talk to the people in the right order.
00:54:58 And then there's a shootout and you got to do it real quick.
00:55:01 And it's very it's very easy to die.
00:55:03 That's what I remember from that.
00:55:05 OK, all right.
00:55:07 But it's not like a roam around.
00:55:09 It's like a click and point move from screen to screen to screen.
00:55:14 Yeah, but it looks similar to this this color palette and stuff.
00:55:18 Yeah, I can.
00:55:20 I'm like, this is cool.
00:55:22 I love the West.
00:55:23 I love the Wild West.
00:55:25 Whatever happened, I love the West.
00:55:27 That's why I love Ukraine and I need to defend democracy.
00:55:35 Whatever happened to the Wild West, they paved it over with grass seed.
00:55:39 And now it's all nice and green.
00:55:40 Where's all the desert gone?
00:55:41 Huh?
00:55:43 Filled it with cactuses and stuff.
00:55:46 They filled the desert with disgusting solar panels.
00:55:52 No, I'm farmland.
00:55:53 They killed all the birds with wind turbines and solar panels.
00:55:57 And they got those like gargantuan monolithic, like water sprinkler systems
00:56:03 to like make a huge circle of crops grow in the middle of the desert.
00:56:08 Know those?
00:56:11 No.
00:56:13 You know, from space, you can see like American
00:56:17 crops grown in circular patterns because it's a very efficient way to water.
00:56:22 They have like a huge.
00:56:23 No, I didn't.
00:56:24 There's a huge pipe from the middle and it rotates on.
00:56:28 It's got a wheel on one end and then water sprinkles down in like a,
00:56:32 I don't know how long it is, but it's very long and it goes around in a big circle.
00:56:36 And that's the most efficient way to water.
00:56:39 And so there's, let me just see if I can get.
00:56:43 It's not crop circles, but it is a circle of crops.
00:56:46 Right. I have.
00:56:47 No, I have not seen the thing you're talking about.
00:56:52 That's what the farms look like from the space, from from high up.
00:56:59 Get a closer one.
00:57:00 That's how they do it.
00:57:01 Oh, so is it just like one big central like spigot
00:57:05 that just shoots the water in a big circle?
00:57:08 No, it's like it's like a it's like a tower in the middle.
00:57:12 Yeah. And then there's a pipe that goes all the way along to the edge.
00:57:16 And then there's a small like another pole with a wheel at the bottom and the wheel turns.
00:57:23 And the pipe turns and the road and the water comes out of like holes
00:57:27 along the pipe down. Yes. Yes.
00:57:30 And so it goes around like that.
00:57:31 And it's like, hmm, that's that's that's how they get you.
00:57:36 That's how they get you.
00:57:38 I see. OK.
00:57:39 And what about all the corners?
00:57:41 That's what I want to know. Wasting animals live there.
00:57:45 Yeah, I can see.
00:57:46 I can see they put buildings there.
00:57:47 They could put buildings and like stuff.
00:57:50 These are really wasted space.
00:57:52 They're really big now.
00:57:54 They're very funny.
00:57:56 Interesting.
00:58:01 What was I was I talking about or have even?
00:58:05 How do you even get here?
00:58:07 Talking about the Wild West, you were looking at a gif.
00:58:09 I don't have anything else to say about the Wild West.
00:58:12 Did you get to the part of medical soul where
00:58:15 soul is in the desert and he gets thirsty?
00:58:19 Oh, gosh, I don't think so.
00:58:23 Right. Well, that's a spoiler, but it's not too big of a spoiler
00:58:26 because they are in New Mexico.
00:58:28 I don't think I've seen that part.
00:58:34 But that's in season five.
00:58:36 Yeah, I think I might not have made it that far.
00:58:42 I would recommend watching the rest.
00:58:44 I should watch the rest. It's good.
00:58:45 Breaking Bad was pretty good, even though I didn't really love
00:58:49 I don't like the final season as much as I like the rest of it.
00:58:51 I like the final season on a rewatch.
00:58:54 I think I feel like Breaking Bad.
00:58:57 You get so hyped up with like everything working well.
00:59:00 And Walter is like he's getting more and more money,
00:59:05 more and more power, and he's getting away with more and more.
00:59:08 And it's like he's gone from this little shitty van.
00:59:11 Now he's working for Gus, but he's scared of Gus.
00:59:14 And then he does the whole like, I got to kill Gus because I got to be
00:59:18 the main character of this enterprise.
00:59:20 And he fucks everything up.
00:59:22 And because of his ego fucking everything up,
00:59:24 everything is just fucked up for the entire rest of the show.
00:59:28 And it's sort of like a tragic tale of like everything is depressing
00:59:31 and it only gets worse until everyone's dead.
00:59:35 Well, like, but like thematically, like on a second watch,
00:59:40 I'm like, I can appreciate how that's that's all done.
00:59:45 It's it's good.
00:59:46 It's a tragic tale.
00:59:47 It shouldn't end in a good thing.
00:59:48 He's making math.
00:59:51 Yeah, I mean, you're right.
00:59:54 Math is good.
00:59:57 I don't know.
00:59:59 He made Sonic the Hedgehog math.
01:00:02 Um, it was blue and it looked nice.
01:00:05 So, you know, that's cool.
01:00:09 Yeah, you ever smoke math?
01:00:13 Nope.
01:00:14 You ever eat it, inject it, speedball it?
01:00:19 Uh, sniff it, snort it.
01:00:23 I looked at it. Don't abort it.
01:00:26 I looked at it so hard that it went into my eye.
01:00:29 Yeah. Yeah.
01:00:33 Woo, I love math.
01:00:35 You ever see you ever see a there's like a subreddit for math?
01:00:39 It's like an r slash math.
01:00:42 Do they like it?
01:00:44 Yeah, they're just like, hey, guys, you know, did some math today.
01:00:48 You know, I'm at work, you know, feeling good.
01:00:50 Love math. I love math.
01:00:54 Why don't they get in trouble for such things?
01:00:57 Um, admitting to taking a drug, I guess.
01:01:01 I don't know.
01:01:02 I guess the law is like, you can't be, you can't have it.
01:01:06 You can't sell it.
01:01:08 But if you've already done it, the only thing that's going to stop you
01:01:12 is like, you can't do a sports event.
01:01:15 Is it illegal to be under the influence by itself?
01:01:19 I don't really know.
01:01:21 I don't really know the details of the math laws.
01:01:25 Maybe maybe you could be like, oh, yeah, I did math.
01:01:29 It's like, oh, so you bought math? No, I didn't buy it.
01:01:31 Just found it.
01:01:32 Just found it on the side of the road.
01:01:34 No crime took place.
01:01:35 I just immediately took it so I didn't I didn't have it.
01:01:39 I inherited it.
01:01:43 I inherited this math.
01:01:44 It was passed down to me.
01:01:46 Uh, it's non-taxable.
01:01:49 Also, saw this go fund me.
01:01:52 I saw this like memorial for this family that was murdered by their dad.
01:02:00 Terrific. Yeah, I saw the obituary.
01:02:03 Yeah, I was I saw the obituary for the dad and it was like.
01:02:08 Damn, people were commenting like in memorial of the dad
01:02:13 saying like nice stuff about him, saying like he always spent
01:02:17 he always like made time for his kids made time for his family and stuff.
01:02:21 And it's like, damn, what? What the fuck?
01:02:24 He literally murdered them.
01:02:26 Hmm.
01:02:28 Do they know him? Is that why?
01:02:30 Yeah, I have the go fund me right here.
01:02:34 And it's really it's kind of funny that like in their family memorial picture,
01:02:39 like it was a picture with the dad.
01:02:41 So they edited the dad out and they put Jesus in his place.
01:02:46 They just put Jesus over the dad.
01:02:50 And and then in the statement underneath,
01:02:56 like they have like statements by the family members about like in memorial
01:02:59 of all the not the dad, but of all the other the wife and all the kids
01:03:04 about like memorials of them and stuff.
01:03:08 But then they also make like a pro gun statement, like they're really like,
01:03:14 hey, listen, don't don't use this incident to enact like gun laws.
01:03:18 Like we need to protect guns.
01:03:21 Yeah, so important, so important that we protect guns.
01:03:27 And then the.
01:03:29 There was there was there was a separate page for an obituary for the dad
01:03:33 where I saw people people were apparently posting like about what a what a good
01:03:37 what a good dad he was.
01:03:38 So what happened?
01:03:39 He killed them all and then himself.
01:03:41 Yeah, yes. Yes. Yeah.
01:03:44 And now I can't find about any of this.
01:03:46 I just saw people were people were reposting the link on Twitter.
01:03:49 Hang on.
01:03:50 I'm going to follow my book, my guy, Jack, my guy,
01:03:53 Wack Nicholson on Twitter was was posting about it.
01:03:56 That's a little bit fucked.
01:03:58 That's a little bit fucked.
01:03:59 Oh, no, I've brought the mood down.
01:04:02 I've ruined I've ruined another podcast
01:04:07 with my morose bullshit.
01:04:11 Damn it.
01:04:12 All right, yeah, this this was the original tweet,
01:04:14 like reporting on the fact that, like, the obituary exists and stuff.
01:04:18 And I think some of it might have been deleted.
01:04:20 I think some of the comments might have been removed now,
01:04:22 but, like, I saw people posting.
01:04:24 Yeah, posting comments from friends and family about, like,
01:04:29 what a cool guy.
01:04:36 Twitter is insane.
01:04:39 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go. Here we go.
01:04:44 Posts to screen screenshots of these posts, which I can't find any more.
01:04:51 They OK, they locked the obituary.
01:04:52 Yeah, the obituary has been locked, so, like,
01:04:54 you visitors can no longer view it, but.
01:05:00 We don't know the wise and house, but I do know it's not our right to judge.
01:05:04 And the Lord loves Michael very much.
01:05:07 It's not our right to judge.
01:05:08 It's not our right to judge.
01:05:09 God damn, that's a that's a fucked up thing to say.
01:05:12 Genuinely, a fucked up thing to say.
01:05:15 I mean, maybe had a good reason for killing his whole family.
01:05:18 Maybe, maybe. I don't know.
01:05:19 How do you know unless you've walked a mile in his shoes?
01:05:23 God forbid you haven't had to walk a mile in his shoe.
01:05:33 OK, I did. I saw this yesterday.
01:05:35 You know what? I'll tell you the truth.
01:05:36 I'll tell you the truth. I was a little bit.
01:05:38 I was a little bit high.
01:05:39 I was a little bit high on marijuana.
01:05:42 Oh, my God, when I read this, when I read this, it's so much worse than math.
01:05:48 It was worse than math.
01:05:49 Being being a tiny little bit high on a small amount of weed
01:05:54 and reading this article, it was like, oh, my God, the world is ending.
01:06:03 It felt pretty bad.
01:06:04 Is a really truly a dreadful experience.
01:06:10 And I just wanted to share it with everyone.
01:06:16 Yeah, good job. Share the love.
01:06:22 OK, well, I'm glad.
01:06:26 Oh, the wife had filed for divorce.
01:06:31 The wife couldn't have that.
01:06:33 Yeah, I'm looking at some of the comments.
01:06:37 Here's here's here's a news article.
01:06:38 Is there like about the incident like a like a police report on like what's
01:06:43 been found out about the what's happened?
01:06:46 Well, why do you do it?
01:06:47 I just linked an article that is like,
01:06:51 yeah, father killed his wife, five children and his and his mother-in-law
01:06:55 before turning the gun on himself.
01:06:58 Michael Hade, 42, shot his wife, Tasha, 40 weeks.
01:07:02 After she filed for divorce, her wife of 40 years old,
01:07:06 weeks after she filed for divorce.
01:07:09 He is also thought to have killed their three daughters and two sons,
01:07:12 aged seven, 12, 17, four and seven.
01:07:18 Police have not confirmed that he was motivated by his wife's divorce.
01:07:21 Well, how would how would police confirm that?
01:07:24 Again, what are you going to ask?
01:07:25 Are you going to ask him?
01:07:27 Get a say on this.
01:07:29 Less than one month after remark ten years since the Sandy Hook tragedy,
01:07:32 another mass shooting has claimed the lives of five more children in Enoch City.
01:07:37 Enoch City, the morning with the Enoch City.
01:07:40 You talk to me. I guess it's near Sandy Hook.
01:07:42 Yeah, whatever.
01:07:43 This is your brain on on Mormonism.
01:07:49 Actually, they might not be Mormons.
01:07:52 I mean, they put that Jesus.
01:07:53 No, Mormons like Jesus.
01:07:54 Mormons like Jesus, too, right?
01:07:56 They're like, yeah, I think so.
01:07:58 Aren't they like a sect of Christianity?
01:08:01 Um, oh, wait, no, no, it was it was like one guy who said,
01:08:05 I'm actually the coolest guy and I'll write a book about it.
01:08:08 And everyone's like, cool.
01:08:09 They're like sort of Chris.
01:08:11 They're like a they're like a weird Christian offshoot sect.
01:08:14 Because, yeah, like, I think they do believe that Christ was the the the redeemer and all that stuff.
01:08:21 But then they have this other guy.
01:08:24 What's his name?
01:08:25 Jimmy Joe Bomson, the the Messiah,
01:08:29 too, who supposedly was he was not he was just a prophet.
01:08:33 He was just a prophet.
01:08:34 Yes, said like all this weird shit that they believe like that Jesus lived in America and stuff.
01:08:39 La Mal literally, literally epic.
01:08:45 I remember learning about that in school and being like,
01:08:47 I wonder how I could start a religion if I just write a book, would people believe it?
01:08:52 Because that's what he did.
01:08:53 Yeah, I wonder like what was what was the PR campaign?
01:08:56 He can't he can't have just written a book and like that was it.
01:08:58 There must have been no he was getting it out there.
01:09:02 He knew he knew a guy.
01:09:03 His dad's friend was a basis and he knew a guy.
01:09:09 He put it in front of some people who like to talk to God, you know.
01:09:11 Yeah, I know a guy.
01:09:12 His name is God.
01:09:13 Have you ever met him?
01:09:15 I can introduce you.
01:09:17 I got his number right here.
01:09:19 Have you heard about his redeeming blood?
01:09:23 It's good for you.
01:09:25 It's good shit.
01:09:26 It's good shit, man.
01:09:29 Check it out.
01:09:30 Don't sleep on this.
01:09:34 Cracking my crack in my elbow.
01:09:36 You should put Mormonism on adult swim.
01:09:39 Food for thought.
01:09:39 They should put Ukraine on adult swim.
01:09:43 Why is nobody on the adult swim talking about the war in Ukraine?
01:09:47 I don't know.
01:09:49 Is there like a new Rick and Morty season coming out?
01:09:51 Maybe Rick said something.
01:09:53 We got to defend democracy, Morty.
01:09:56 We got to defend those Ruskies.
01:09:58 We can kill the Ruskies, Morty.
01:10:05 The integrity of NATO is at stake, Morty.
01:10:09 Yeah, that's exactly what he was saying.
01:10:11 International trade.
01:10:14 It's Europe's bread basket, Morty.
01:10:16 It's driving up bread prices.
01:10:18 They produce 10% of the world's wheat supply.
01:10:26 I'm not talking about marijuana.
01:10:27 I'm talking about wheat, Morty.
01:10:29 I'm talking about wheat.
01:10:30 You eat it every day.
01:10:31 Have I talked about how much I love oats?
01:10:33 Have I talked about how delicious oats are
01:10:35 and how there's such a treat?
01:10:37 Get that clip and then make it be phantom horror and saying it.
01:10:45 I have become...
01:10:45 No, I don't think you have.
01:10:48 They're just so delicious.
01:10:49 They're just so delicious.
01:10:51 You talked about your cold brew oats with better stevia.
01:10:58 Here's what you do.
01:10:59 Go to Hanifords.
01:11:00 Sugar-free maple syrup.
01:11:02 You just dump a bunch of that into your oats
01:11:04 and you add almond milk and you add some salt.
01:11:08 And it's like ice cream.
01:11:10 It's like ice cream.
01:11:11 It's so good.
01:11:13 It's decadent.
01:11:14 And it's got macro nutrients.
01:11:17 It's got macro nutrients, Morty.
01:11:20 The macro nutrient profile is insane.
01:11:23 Some basic rolled oats from Quaker.
01:11:27 I recommend better than rolled oats, quick oats.
01:11:32 Quick ones.
01:11:33 Which are just rolled oats, but they roll them even harder.
01:11:36 And I feel like I haven't seen them quick oats.
01:11:39 They're so quick they fly off the shelves.
01:11:42 They're like cryptids.
01:11:44 They're like those insects that move so fast
01:11:46 that the human eye can't see them.
01:11:47 They're like, yeah, ghost insects.
01:11:49 You know the ones.
01:11:51 Ghost insects?
01:11:53 Yeah, you know.
01:11:53 That doesn't sound appetizing at all.
01:11:58 You gotta eat the bugs.
01:11:59 You gotta eat the bugs, Morty.
01:12:00 You gotta get in the pod, Morty.
01:12:02 You gotta eat the bugs, Morty.
01:12:03 Eat this cricket flower.
01:12:04 You put it in your smoothie.
01:12:06 Hey, I've been playing Disco Elysium.
01:12:09 You play that?
01:12:10 Oh, I bought it on sale.
01:12:12 I was gonna play it.
01:12:12 I also bought it on sale.
01:12:13 I've been playing it for a couple of days now.
01:12:18 It's good.
01:12:20 I was watching a friend play it on a little Discord stream,
01:12:23 and I noticed that the main thing was that the guy,
01:12:26 the narrator, has a big, booming voice, very deep.
01:12:31 Is that?
01:12:31 Yeah, I think that guy's in Hades, too.
01:12:33 I've definitely heard that guy voice some other stuff.
01:12:36 He probably does the Arby's commercials.
01:12:38 He's probably like...
01:12:39 Like a delicious food, and then he goes on to make a video game.
01:12:47 Did you play at Hades?
01:12:50 Nope.
01:12:51 Hades nuts?
01:12:52 No.
01:12:54 Okay, I guess the guy's name is Lenval Brown.
01:12:59 I'm like 90% sure that he's in Hades, too.
01:13:02 Or maybe some other game.
01:13:03 Astria ascending, Disco Elysium, and Black is Belza.
01:13:11 What the fuck?
01:13:12 Disco Elysium, narrator, who recorded 350,000 words of dialogue
01:13:18 and has never acted before.
01:13:20 What?
01:13:21 What's going on?
01:13:22 That's just how he speaks.
01:13:24 That's just how he goes.
01:13:26 I'm sure it may be so.
01:13:27 I mean, yeah, his voice is great, but I was like a million percent sure.
01:13:33 But I'd heard it somewhere before.
01:13:35 Maybe it's a voice many people can do.
01:13:38 You just got to have huge lines.
01:13:39 I don't think so.
01:13:40 I don't think...
01:13:42 You got to have like a frog throat to fit that vocal chord in there.
01:13:47 I don't know how that works.
01:13:52 Yeah, okay, well, I guess I'm freaking stupid or something.
01:13:59 But anyway, I was really struggling with the format, the genre of the game.
01:14:11 I found it really annoying at first, because I don't really play games like that.
01:14:19 It was a lot of reading, which is okay, because the writing's pretty good.
01:14:24 I think the writing is good.
01:14:25 But I was kind of annoyed by the fact that you never heard someone say it's like a book
01:14:32 with its pages stuck together.
01:14:35 The game is pretty much just there to make you work in between making you read stuff.
01:14:42 What do you mean, work?
01:14:44 I mean, okay, the game is basically writing.
01:14:50 The majority of what you do in Disco Elysium is read and or listen to text.
01:14:55 And that's fine, but you have to just walk between places and find stuff,
01:15:02 and you have to bring things to certain places in order to get that text.
01:15:10 Why is it not just a book?
01:15:12 Why is it not just a freaking book if you just want me to read?
01:15:15 Why do I have to walk back and forth across town just to read what happened?
01:15:21 Your input has like changes in the story?
01:15:26 Sometimes that's true.
01:15:27 You know, I kind of got over it.
01:15:29 I moved past that it stopped bothering me after a while.
01:15:33 It was kind of just like the first day I was playing it.
01:15:35 I was like, why is it making me work so hard just to let me advance the story, dog?
01:15:44 It was not helped by the fact that I had a couple of deaths early on
01:15:49 that made me like re...
01:15:51 I didn't save for a while, and so I had to like redo a bunch of stuff, and it was really annoying.
01:15:58 I'm not gonna say that was partly my fault for not saving enough, but you know, whatever.
01:16:06 The game does autosave, so I kind of just assumed that the autosave function would
01:16:10 prevent me from having to redo like large sections, but no, it didn't.
01:16:20 Yeah, I feel like I would probably enjoy it.
01:16:24 I don't mind a reading game, but I do, like if there's like mysteries to uncover and like
01:16:32 deducing to do to like figure out what the hell is going on, that's stuff I like.
01:16:38 I'm not saying I minded the reading.
01:16:40 I'm just saying that I felt like if I'm here to read, just let me read, and all the stuff I had
01:16:47 to do in between reading just felt like a lot of busy work.
01:16:54 Are you able to like goof around?
01:16:56 You mean in the game?
01:16:58 Are you able to like bunny hop and throw things?
01:17:00 No.
01:17:02 Then there is no point.
01:17:04 Why would they do that?
01:17:05 There's no...
01:17:06 I mean, if they allowed you to like fuck around in between like story bits, then that's okay.
01:17:12 I like being able to fuck around a bit.
01:17:14 Well, the only like...
01:17:14 I've seen...
01:17:15 I've sensed that it's a very serious game where every action is important.
01:17:19 So I'm like, ah, I gotta have to role play.
01:17:21 I'm gonna have to be like sensible, but I want to throw shit.
01:17:25 I mean, you've seen the game.
01:17:26 You know it's not the kind of game that you can bunny hop and throw shit.
01:17:29 But I want to though.
01:17:31 That's what I like.
01:17:33 No, I mean, there basically is no gameplay other than moving, going to different places and
01:17:41 selecting which thing to interact with, which just triggers text.
01:17:46 Do you think it would be a better game if it was like
01:17:49 points and click, like click your map to go to the new location rather than walking around?
01:17:55 No.
01:17:57 You know, it's not really that...
01:17:59 No, it's not really that big a deal.
01:18:02 It's not actually that hard to like get places.
01:18:04 It's just maybe like a minute or two of walking.
01:18:08 I'm trying to decide if this is an actual problem that I have,
01:18:15 or if I don't actually care that much.
01:18:17 I think you just had to reload and you're still frustrated.
01:18:21 That really did annoy me.
01:18:24 I'll be sure to save.
01:18:26 Definitely save often.
01:18:28 Yeah, that's my takeaway.
01:18:30 Definitely save often.
01:18:31 I get the feeling that you can get a lot of different...
01:18:40 I don't know how many like actual different outcomes there are to things.
01:18:44 I know that you can have...
01:18:45 There's a bunch of sort of different paths in the game that you can sort of choose and
01:18:50 sort of like how in like a Mass Effect, there's like, you know,
01:18:54 you can do the Renegade option or the Paragon option and just go Elysium.
01:18:59 It's like there's more of them, but there's still like clear cut.
01:19:02 Like this is the Communist option.
01:19:04 This is the Fascist option.
01:19:06 This is the Libertarian option, et cetera, et cetera.
01:19:10 This is the like, I don't care about anything and I'm a Nihilist and I hate myself option.
01:19:17 Did you pick that one?
01:19:21 I've kind of been waffling between that one and Communism.
01:19:27 Just like real life.
01:19:28 Just like in real life.
01:19:30 I'll go Full Fascist.
01:19:32 I'll do it.
01:19:33 The Fascist one.
01:19:33 Somebody's got to do it.
01:19:35 You know, I don't want to really comment on it until I've gotten to the end.
01:19:40 At the moment, I'm sort of like...
01:19:44 I'm a little bit unsure.
01:19:47 The game's politics are a little bit...
01:19:52 I'm not really sure.
01:19:53 Like, I don't know.
01:19:54 I'm going to wait till the end.
01:19:55 I feel like I shouldn't comment on like,
01:19:56 what is it saying about any of these things until I've gotten to the end and I've sort of seen
01:20:01 like what it actually says.
01:20:04 Although, I will say that a lot of the responses are very cartoony.
01:20:08 Like, a lot of the...
01:20:15 Sometimes it is a bit...
01:20:17 I think it's trying to be...
01:20:18 It's funny on purpose.
01:20:19 Like it's deliberately silly, but it's very much like when you do the Communist option,
01:20:23 a lot of the choices are just like very bloodthirsty, just about like how many people you want to
01:20:27 send to their deaths in the gulag and stuff.
01:20:30 Which is fine.
01:20:33 But it's not that compelling.
01:20:35 Like, it's just a little ha-ha joke.
01:20:37 Like, Communism, a 14 billion dead of Venezuela.
01:20:43 Vuvuzela.
01:20:44 Yeah.
01:20:45 Yeah, a lot of very cartoony dialogue options.
01:20:48 And the game tells you like, it's okay if you say weird stuff.
01:20:51 There's...
01:20:52 The framing device of the game is that you are a complete...
01:20:57 You've woken up and you've lost all your memories and you have no idea who you are.
01:21:02 So that's the reason why.
01:21:03 You can pretty much just say anything and it's sort of justifiable.
01:21:08 Because like, you are pretty much a blank slate.
01:21:13 Do you have to start...
01:21:16 Do your options lessen the more you learn about yourself?
01:21:22 They have not lessened for me.
01:21:27 I mean, you know, you learn very quickly that you are a cop.
01:21:31 Like, you have a job as a cop.
01:21:33 But you can decide like, well, yeah, my job is as a cop.
01:21:37 But I've decided that I'm still going to be like a communist revolutionary,
01:21:41 even as I do my cop jobs.
01:21:44 Yeah, your memory, I guess your memory doesn't come back.
01:21:47 You just learn new information.
01:21:49 I think...
01:21:50 Old information.
01:21:53 Yes.
01:21:54 You can still act however you want when the guy's of like, I don't remember stuff.
01:22:02 Like, you are an alcoholic.
01:22:05 You are an alcoholic.
01:22:06 You have drug problems and all that stuff.
01:22:11 You can fall back into that if you want or you can try to not do that.
01:22:17 I'm staying clean.
01:22:19 I'm staying clean.
01:22:21 Just like in Lisa.
01:22:23 Hell yeah.
01:22:24 Hell yeah.
01:22:25 Drugs are bad.
01:22:25 Meth is bad.
01:22:27 Don't do weed.
01:22:27 They have blue meth in that game as well.
01:22:31 Oh, the joy.
01:22:32 The joy.
01:22:33 It's blue.
01:22:34 Yeah, it is blue.
01:22:35 Hell yeah.
01:22:36 And they have a bald guy too.
01:22:39 Just like Walter.
01:22:43 And it's in the desert.
01:22:45 Oh my god.
01:22:46 It's just the sequel.
01:22:51 There's a lot of funny racism in Disco Elysium.
01:22:56 And by funny racism, I mean that you meet people who are racist, but they're very silly.
01:23:02 They're like, there's a guy called Measurehead who is like,
01:23:07 he sees himself as the perfect display of his ethnic identity.
01:23:12 And he's got full body tattoos showing how perfect his skull is and stuff.
01:23:18 He's just really into skull measuring and he loves it.
01:23:24 Yeah.
01:23:25 The writing's good.
01:23:27 It is cartoony sometimes.
01:23:28 That's egg behavior.
01:23:29 Huh?
01:23:30 That's egg behavior.
01:23:31 Egg behavior?
01:23:33 Get a tattoo of skull measurements on all of your body.
01:23:38 How is that the term egg?
01:23:39 I'm fucking joking.
01:23:41 I mean that doesn't, I don't get the connection, but sure.
01:23:45 Cause like shapes of skull between men and women differ slightly.
01:23:54 And some trans people get a little obsessed about their skull not being the right shape.
01:24:00 And so they have surgery to change it.
01:24:02 Oh, I see.
01:24:03 I see.
01:24:05 No, this guy's got the perfect skull.
01:24:06 No, he would never change his skull.
01:24:09 He likes it.
01:24:11 And that's it.
01:24:12 That's all I have to say about him.
01:24:15 He's a funny racist and I'm a big fan of him.
01:24:18 You can choose to adopt his philosophies and befriend him in order to get him to do stuff for you.
01:24:26 But I didn't do that because I'm nice.
01:24:28 I'm a nice and I'm a communist and I don't like racism.
01:24:31 I think racism's bad actually in real life.
01:24:37 What do you think?
01:24:38 What do you think about it?
01:24:39 Very interesting.
01:24:39 Sorry, I just happened to be yawning.
01:24:42 Oh, boy.
01:24:47 Good.
01:24:49 I'm sorry.
01:24:49 I'm tired.
01:24:50 No, racism, that sucks.
01:24:52 Do you denounce racism in the middle of the yawn?
01:24:58 Why did you hesitate?
01:24:59 Why did you hesitate?
01:25:01 I was in taking oxygen.
01:25:03 I'm sorry.
01:25:04 We'll see about that.
01:25:06 I don't know.
01:25:07 People tell me to play Disco Elysium for a while and I'm finally playing it.
01:25:10 And I'm bringing up gripes, but I do like it.
01:25:15 At the end of the day, the game is mostly about reading stuff and the writing is pretty good.
01:25:19 So that makes it like pretty good at what it's doing.
01:25:25 I know my character's name now.
01:25:27 You don't know your name when you wake up, but I know it now.
01:25:30 So that's pretty cool.
01:25:32 I know some stuff.
01:25:34 Insane.
01:25:35 Yeah, yeah, that's right.
01:25:38 That's right.
01:25:39 Anyway, that's another.
01:25:42 Yeah, like I said, I haven't been working.
01:25:44 I've only been working a little bit on that thing that I was supposed to do by the end of the year.
01:25:49 Instead of that, I've been playing Noida, which is bad.
01:25:51 But I've also, you know, I said you can play Noida and that's a waste of time,
01:25:55 or you can play the classics.
01:25:56 You can play something that's edifying and good for you.
01:25:59 And I think Disco Elysium is more on that side of things.
01:26:02 So I don't feel that bad about it.
01:26:05 And also it's $9 and it's probably not on sale anymore.
01:26:11 So sorry if you missed it.
01:26:14 Oops.
01:26:14 Oops, but it'll probably go on sale again.
01:26:18 Yeah, yeah.
01:26:21 Ben, I heard that there is a steam version of Dwarf Fortress out.
01:26:29 Yeah.
01:26:30 Like an updated new, it's like with graphics.
01:26:33 Yeah.
01:26:34 It's like the new version of Dwarf Fortress.
01:26:38 Have you played it?
01:26:40 I mean, I have not played the steam version.
01:26:42 I did see people talking about the steam version.
01:26:45 And I guess there was a big,
01:26:48 a lot of people are giving Dwarf Fortress a try for the first time now,
01:26:54 which is pretty cool.
01:26:56 Have you played it before?
01:26:58 No, I hear about your things and I had been meaning to get around to like giving it a go
01:27:04 I mean, it's fun.
01:27:07 And I do recommend giving it a shot to see what it's all about.
01:27:11 I have not played it in a while.
01:27:14 Although I do have some funny stories from old fortresses that me and some friends ran together.
01:27:21 The the yeah, I haven't seen what the text.
01:27:26 There already were like fan made texture packs that you could apply to the game to give it like
01:27:31 sort of graphics.
01:27:33 I'm not sure.
01:27:35 I haven't seen what the new with the steam versions graphics look like.
01:27:38 But I guess people like them because people seem to be responding positively to it.
01:27:43 Do you know that like the guy who made Dwarf Fortress has like cancer and like the reason he
01:27:48 put he did this is like to pay for his cancer treatment.
01:27:52 Oh, yeah, I didn't know that he that's terrible.
01:27:56 It is.
01:27:57 Yeah, he's he's he's had cancer for a few years.
01:27:59 And I think, well, what I mean is he I think the idea I don't think I don't think he would have
01:28:06 cared to put it on steam.
01:28:08 But I think part of the reason why he did is because he needs to make money largely for that.
01:28:15 And so it's kind of good that like it's sold like millions of copies and he's made like millions
01:28:20 of dollars off of the steam version like I'm like good.
01:28:24 Yeah, that's that's great.
01:28:25 I mean, it was it was free the whole time, wasn't it?
01:28:29 Yeah.
01:28:29 And I mean, it's still free the original version, but like the steam version with like the the
01:28:34 pack and all that the graphics is I don't know how much it costs.
01:28:39 But you know, a lot of people bought it.
01:28:45 How much do you check how much it is?
01:28:48 Yeah, I didn't think it was too expensive when I checked.
01:28:51 I forget.
01:28:52 I assume the original version is still free.
01:28:54 It's all it's always been free.
01:28:56 Okay, it's 30 it's $30.
01:28:58 It's $30, which is you know, whatever.
01:29:02 I have a dwarf fortress.
01:29:03 I mean, I would say.
01:29:05 As I've given you $30 worth of entertainment.
01:29:08 It's definitely.
01:29:09 Yeah, of course, definitely.
01:29:11 You don't even need to play.
01:29:12 You don't even need to play the game for to give you.
01:29:14 You should buy the game even if you'll never play it just because it's it's
01:29:18 the stories you'll hear from other people.
01:29:20 Yeah.
01:29:21 Are worth the 30.
01:29:21 Do you know that there's a YouTuber called Krug Smash who makes these really?
01:29:28 Yeah, you've mentioned him before.
01:29:29 Yeah, yeah.
01:29:30 I haven't caught up with his stuff in a while, but he's made some really
01:29:34 some very cool and good like narrative like series about like the stories of his dwarves
01:29:43 and the fortresses they build and tournament arcs and stuff like that.
01:29:47 So cool rules.
01:29:49 And yeah, did I?
01:29:54 Oh, man, I don't want to repeat this.
01:29:57 I feel like I might have.
01:29:58 Did you did you listen to last week's episode?
01:30:01 The one that was the Ben cast?
01:30:03 I think I got halfway through.
01:30:05 I feel like I might have talked about this on that the story of like
01:30:10 or maybe I talked to you about it.
01:30:11 The one about the cats poisoning themselves.
01:30:16 Poisoning themselves.
01:30:17 Gosh, I hope.
01:30:19 Yeah.
01:30:19 Okay, there's this interview with Tarn Adams, the guy that makes Dwarf Fortress,
01:30:25 and they asked him and he's talking about the game and he's talking about like
01:30:29 stuff that happens when he's when he's fixing bugs, right?
01:30:33 And the story is basically that there are taverns that there was like he had just added
01:30:41 taverns to the game and in the taverns, the dwarves would go to the bar and they would drink.
01:30:47 And then if they wanted to stop drinking, they would just throw their mugs on the ground
01:30:52 and the alcohol would just spill on the ground, which is fine.
01:30:56 Like that's okay for Dwarf to do that.
01:30:58 That's normal dwarf behavior.
01:31:00 But the alcohol interacted with like a previously added module that accounted for like the effects
01:31:07 of like poisoning and alcohol is considered a poison that causes, you know, a certain effect.
01:31:15 And so what would happen was cats would walk through, pet cats would walk through the bar
01:31:22 and just the way that like fluids work, cats would walk through these puddles of alcohol
01:31:28 and they would get alcohol on their paws.
01:31:32 And it would consider that like an entire mug of alcohol was like stuck to their paws
01:31:39 when they walked through it.
01:31:40 Okay, flashback.
01:31:42 Flashback to another thing.
01:31:43 Dwarves have to clean themselves.
01:31:45 When dwarves get dirty, like every individual part of their body will get like the substance on them,
01:31:51 right?
01:31:51 And the dwarves have to clean themselves and they have to like take soap and they have to wash
01:31:57 like their hand, they have to wash their arm, they have to wash their upper arm,
01:31:59 they have to wash their face.
01:32:01 And if they would get something in their eye, they would have to take like a bar of soap
01:32:06 and like individually wash their eyeball to clean their eyes out.
01:32:10 And it's like, that's weird.
01:32:11 So they changed it.
01:32:12 They changed the behavior so that the dwarf's eyelids interact with their eyeballs
01:32:17 in such a way that if the eyelid blinks, the dwarf's eyeball is cleaned of any substances
01:32:21 that are afflicting it.
01:32:23 Okay, flashback.
01:32:25 I didn't know individual dwarves had like variables for every single other part of their body.
01:32:31 Well, I've told you that one of my favorite stories of a fortress I had is that is one guy
01:32:37 in a fortress and the fortress was attacked by a wear giraffe.
01:32:41 And a dwarf warrior was defending the fort and he got the wear giraffe like
01:32:47 punched him so hard in the face that he died, right?
01:32:50 And he got buried in the catacombs.
01:32:53 And one of my other dwarves would go to, I kept seeing him going back and forth between the
01:32:59 catacombs and the place where the guy got killed during the battle.
01:33:03 And he kept going back and forth, back and forth.
01:33:05 And when I looked into like who this dwarf was, why is he going back and forth, back and forth?
01:33:09 He was a friend of the guy who was killed and he had buried the guy's body in the catacombs,
01:33:15 but he kept going back to where he died because when the guy got punched,
01:33:19 the punch had shattered his face and sent all of his teeth flying.
01:33:23 And so he kept going back to the battleground and finding more of his teeth and bringing
01:33:28 the teeth to the catacombs and putting them in the coffin.
01:33:30 And then he'd go back and find more of the guy's teeth and bring them back to the catacombs
01:33:34 and put the more teeth in the coffin.
01:33:36 Why would he do this?
01:33:37 Because he wanted to put all the pieces together in the coffin.
01:33:42 He wanted to bury all of his friends' body parts.
01:33:46 How do you even write code that would allow for this situation?
01:33:50 But anyway, the ending of the cat story is that, okay,
01:33:54 so there's this self-cleaning behavior is added to creatures.
01:33:57 Creatures' body parts clean the other.
01:34:01 And so the cats would walk through this alcohol on the floor of the bar and track it on their paws.
01:34:07 And then the cat would do a cleaning behavior on the paw.
01:34:10 They would use their tongue to clean the alcohol off of their paws.
01:34:13 However, because of the way that it was considered to be drinking,
01:34:20 then, this alcohol that was stuck to their paws.
01:34:22 And it was considering that an entire mug's worth of alcohol was stuck to the cat's paw.
01:34:27 And it was drinking it as it cleaned it with its tongue.
01:34:30 And therefore, it was considering that the cat was drinking basically an entire
01:34:33 dwarven mug's worth of alcohol whenever it would clean it off its paws.
01:34:37 And this was like too much alcohol for a cat to drink.
01:34:40 And therefore, it would interact with the poison module.
01:34:42 And the poison module would consider that considering the cat's small body weight,
01:34:46 drinking this much alcohol raises its blood alcohol level
01:34:50 to a point that it enters the lethal area.
01:34:52 And it triggers the lethal effects of alcohol, including respiratory failure.
01:34:57 And so the cats would clean their paws and drink so much alcohol in doing so
01:35:01 that they would respiratory fail and they would die like right on the on the bar floor.
01:35:06 So cats would just get poisoned and die in the middle of the bar
01:35:08 from cleaning the alcohol off their paws.
01:35:11 Lamal. Oh, no.
01:35:15 So. Hey, Dwarfs, just don't throw it on the ground.
01:35:20 No, they come on. They gotta. They gotta, though.
01:35:26 So that's the kind of game Dwarf Fortress is.
01:35:31 Yeah, I feel like like if I play it, like, is it a difficult game?
01:35:39 Well, it's like Tetris, right? You just go until you lose.
01:35:44 OK, it's difficult. I mean, the difficulty of it is pretty much just like knowing
01:35:51 how to do certain things. But like there you pretty much just it's about navigating menus,
01:35:58 like telling your dwarves what to do is just about navigating menus to find like how to tell
01:36:03 them to do X thing. And so it's useful to have like a wiki to tell you like, how do I tell
01:36:10 my dwarves how to do this? How do I tell my dwarves how to do that? Like, what do I need to do?
01:36:15 I mean, the basic what you basically have to do is first you have to you dig out.
01:36:20 You dig out a fortress. Usually you'll you'll dig out like an initial settlement to live in.
01:36:26 And then once everyone's all settled and has like beds to sleep in,
01:36:30 you set up beds and then you'll start digging like a bigger fortress. And then in the you'll
01:36:35 set up workshops where the dwarves will start making stuff. And yeah, making stuff in the
01:36:41 making stuff in the workshops is like a big that's like where you get most of your stuff.
01:36:47 Digging out the fortress and digging out like mine shafts to find materials
01:36:52 to then make stuff in the workshops. And then you make stuff and then you trade anything you
01:36:56 can't make you trade with like merchants that pass by. You know, you engage in trade to get
01:37:02 stuff you need. And then setting up a military setting up a military is pretty complicated.
01:37:10 You don't really I mean you you can get by for a little while without a military but like you
01:37:15 will eventually need one or you'll die pretty quick because like threats will escalating threats will
01:37:24 come to attack your fortress pretty much the bigger and more successful your fortress gets the more
01:37:28 like dangerous and like legendary monsters will start coming to fucking get you. And so you'll
01:37:35 need a stronger like a weird dress. Where yeah, where creatures will just wander by sometimes
01:37:41 just randomly. I mean, there starts to be things like there are things called forgotten beasts
01:37:47 that are like sort of randomly generated like timeless creatures from like before the world
01:37:54 began. And some of them can be really some of them can be like pathetic and not even a threat.
01:37:59 And some other ones can be like really, really dangerous. It sort of just depends on like what
01:38:04 random attributes they're given. And I mean, you might have where where where creatures will
01:38:12 wander by and yet if they if they bite of a dwarf in the course of the fight, they might infect
01:38:19 a dwarf with lycanthropy and then you won't know until the next full moon. And then suddenly one
01:38:26 some of your dwarfs that got bit will go crazy at the full moon and they'll start rampaging
01:38:31 they'll start biting other dwarfs. And then you might have like a lycanthropy infection.
01:38:36 And that's a problem. You can have the same thing with vampirism. Sometimes sometimes a vampire
01:38:41 will join your fortress and you won't know who's a vampire. But your dwarfs will just sometimes
01:38:47 find other dwarfs like drained of all their blood and dead in their beds one morning and they'll
01:38:51 be like, Well, somebody's a vampire. And then you have to quarantine everybody and question them.
01:38:58 You have to. Yeah, there are some tells that you there are some tricks you can know to like sort
01:39:05 of figure out. Oh, it's garlic bread day, everybody ever ever get your garlic bread.
01:39:09 I've heard that one thing that can be a big giveaway for a vampire is like,
01:39:15 like you'll look at a dwarf and he'll look like you can't just see that he's a vampire until
01:39:21 someone accuses him of being a vampire. And like they write like it doesn't share that information
01:39:29 with the player. But a vampire will be really, really old most of the time. And so a vampire will
01:39:33 often have like a huge list of like people that they know. And so if there's if there's like a
01:39:39 dwarf that seems young and yet they know like tons of people, especially like from lots of faraway
01:39:44 places, it might be a tell that like this guy's probably this guy's older than these seams. He's
01:39:48 a vampire. Could just be a very so it could be a socialite. Yeah, you never know. You never really
01:39:55 know. But your dwarves will sometimes have like they might have like family and friends from like
01:40:02 yeah, from like other fortresses or like other countries and stuff. And like they might have
01:40:08 different gods they worship and like different different dwarves worship different gods and
01:40:14 stuff and like different cities might have different gods that they like. It has a whole it has it
01:40:21 simulates a whole like a whole like nation a whole like national history, which is really awesome.
01:40:27 One of my favorite things to do is to have my dwarves mint coins and just see like what images
01:40:31 they they they press into the coins that they mint. And they'll do like symbols of their nation or
01:40:37 like symbols of of their city or like pictures of like the rulers of their of the dwarven empire and
01:40:44 stuff. Yeah. Um, for just so freaking cool. But also it's kind of a hassle. It's kind of it's
01:40:57 kind of a hassle to play. And like, yeah, if you don't know how to play it, you pretty much need to
01:41:02 have a guide to like look up to tell you like how do I what menu do I go into to like build a
01:41:10 like woodworking shop if I want to make like beds? Yeah, I mean, that's how Minecraft was. It
01:41:17 doesn't explain anything. You have to have the wiki open. I mean, at least in Dwarf Fortress,
01:41:23 like the menu is right there. You can just kind of like look around in the menu and see what's there
01:41:28 on your own. Theoretically, yeah, you you can just
01:41:36 it does tell you like everything is right there in the menu, you can just see it and it's like oh,
01:41:41 this is the but like how to like actually do it is a little can be a little bit complex and a guide
01:41:47 can be useful to sort of like talk you through it. Yeah, because there's a lot of options that are
01:41:56 like, I mean, if you really want to when you're making a military, you can like get really down to
01:42:01 the minutiae and tell you like your individual soldiers like what weapons you want them to
01:42:06 wield and like what pieces of armor you want them to wear and stuff. Can you like create a rank and
01:42:12 then assign bits of armor to that rank? Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can make like you can make
01:42:20 different like squads that have like different like uniforms basically. And or you can I think
01:42:26 you can even tell and you can tell an individual like soldier like okay you can like assign them
01:42:31 as like captain or you can say like okay I want this guy to wear that I want this guy to wear that.
01:42:37 You can you to give them like usually it's to give them like
01:42:40 legendary or like artifact equipment that you have that you want them to wield.
01:42:44 You know. You know.
01:42:50 I do like managing a system of individuals. Yeah, I've talked about Kenshi before. Kenshi is like
01:43:00 not similar to Dwarf Force Triss but like you have your squad and they have their own individual
01:43:05 inventory and you can build a town with resources that you can get from buying or like mining them
01:43:12 from the wasteland. And it is it does get a little overwhelming if you get too many people.
01:43:19 But I do like that that management stuff. Kenshi. Kenshi, yeah. It's like you have talked about
01:43:29 it but I have not I have not played in. I would recommend that. That's a that's a real good
01:43:36 post apocalypse management RPG where there's no goals at all. It's just don't die.
01:43:48 Interesting. It's like an army kind of like simulator. It looks sort of like an RTS.
01:43:56 No, it's it's action. It's like it all real time.
01:44:00 Everyone has stats. They do things and they get better at their stats. Different races have
01:44:08 bonuses to different things. Robots are immune to acid rain and stuff like that. You can you can
01:44:17 if you get a leather crafter who can craft good leather stuff, you can get like acid
01:44:23 protection gear and then you can go into like cursed like weird
01:44:31 like it's post apocalypse. It's a very unique post apocalypse. Whereas like yeah,
01:44:36 clearly thousands of years ago, there was like a super advanced robot technology. But then
01:44:42 there's like these completely horribly irradiated ash filled like dead zones with giant beasts.
01:44:48 I love giant beasts. And if you can go in there, you can go collect stuff and get secret knowledge.
01:44:57 And you can bring it back and then you'll be so smart. But that's absolutely the game is like
01:45:05 you're just somebody in the wasteland and to survive, you have to band together with people.
01:45:12 And if you get strong enough, you get large enough bands, you can make your own base.
01:45:16 You can defend it from attacks. Cool. And and and slavers and bandits.
01:45:25 And gorillos, they have gorillos. Gorillos.
01:45:30 They're different from gorillas. Like gorillos pickle.
01:45:34 Yeah. Lol. He'll rip your limb from limb.
01:45:40 Intriguing. What else can I say? I'm trying to think, I feel like I had more to say about
01:45:45 Disco Elysium, but like maybe not because like I'm still like working through it. And like,
01:45:50 I guess it's kind of long. And I sort of only am like partway through it. So I'm still,
01:45:57 I'm still thinking about it. Your partner Kim is such a swell guy. He's just such a
01:46:04 little sweetheart. Love him. That's it.
01:46:13 Racism is bad. That's what I've learned from Disco Elysium.
01:46:18 I'm glad you finally get it. I used to think that maybe it was a little bit
01:46:23 based, but Disco Elysium taught me that it's cringe, actually.
01:46:27 People will cringe at you if you are racist. And you don't want that.
01:46:34 No. I wouldn't say so.
01:46:42 I don't have any notes. I think we said this before we started recording, but there's no,
01:46:47 there's been no new One Piece chapter in two weeks now. It seems like.
01:46:51 No. That's maybe one's going to come out tomorrow.
01:46:54 Maybe. Yeah. I thought I was going to, I didn't look last week because I was like,
01:47:02 no, no, I'll save. I'll save the One Piece discussion for when Gibbs back. But I guess
01:47:06 there was there was none anyway. So Oda's getting lazy. He's getting sloppy in his old age. He's
01:47:13 losing his touch. You know, maybe you should pitch maybe you should pitch Clarissa since they're
01:47:21 like clearly One Piece has fallen off to show and jump. They need a new one. Oh, wait, I guess
01:47:27 you already did that. I already did that. That's the Tezuka challenge. Right.
01:47:33 I got a note from a curatorium. He said this fucking sucks. Get better at drawing. And I was
01:47:37 like, right. But you know, but you know what? But you know what? If there if there wasn't any hope
01:47:42 for you, they wouldn't, he wouldn't have even bothered to tell you that it sucks and you need
01:47:46 to improve. So that's good. It's good, actually. It is good. Well, I'm just saying that One Piece
01:47:51 is falling off because it's gone two weeks without an update. So I think Oda's probably finished.
01:47:56 He's toast.
01:48:02 This 2023. Did we even talk about the new year? This is the first one? No, I've been on for the
01:48:09 new year. Yeah, I guess I guess I guess fuck the new year. It's just another year. But wait,
01:48:15 no, you didn't we record one? No, you were on we recorded one on the second.
01:48:21 Yeah, because there was two weeks ago.
01:48:26 Did I? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you know, yeah. Look at the calendar. Look at the calendar.
01:48:32 I'm looking at it. Yeah. 2023, though. Huh. About that. Yeah, I know. Right. I saw you tweet
01:48:38 that like the January is just like the start or it's just like this practice warm up. It's
01:48:44 a warm up. That's it. Yeah. It doesn't it doesn't feel like like I'm ready to do anything yet.
01:48:50 It's just sort of like, yeah, I mean, yeah, I get it. Yeah, I know, like we did the whole like
01:48:56 2023, but like, come on, it's not actually the new year yet. That's how January always feels.
01:49:02 You get to the end of January like, wow, that was yeah, I know. It was quick.
01:49:06 Halfway through it already. Well, we almost two, two thirds of the way through it by the time
01:49:12 this episode's out. Think about that.
01:49:18 I hate it. I just don't care for it very much. I want to get back on the wagon, the drawing
01:49:25 comics wagon. Oh, yeah. Well, that's what I need to get going. Just just make chapter four. Just
01:49:34 make chapter four and then post it and then people be like Pog because at the moment, I don't know
01:49:38 if anyone's Poggin. I don't know if he's Poggin and it's a big problem. Nobody's Poggin about
01:49:43 Clarissa Gunsmoke. I mean, maybe now that the the 3D thing came out that the commission that did
01:49:49 that did make him Pog a little bit. Yeah, makes me Pog a lot. And like,
01:49:56 like I think partly it's just because it's been so long and also most people haven't even read it
01:50:03 yet because I didn't I didn't push it as hard as Beldrape maybe because maybe it's just because it
01:50:09 wasn't finished. Yeah, I guess it wasn't finished. And that was the thing. Chapter four is the next
01:50:15 chapter. Yeah, it still won't be finished. I'll have to draw even more pages. But I should do that.
01:50:24 I should I should do chapter four by the end of the month. I think I can do that much.
01:50:27 I really should. I'm not going to I'm not going to say I'm not going to complain more
01:50:33 about how I haven't finished the book yet. I really was yesterday. I was having a really good
01:50:39 I made really good progress yesterday. I'm really I think I think I've got everything. I think I've
01:50:45 actually collected everything now that I need to put into the final like index. And I don't think
01:50:53 I need any more. Pretty much the index just needed everything to tell the complete story pretty much
01:50:58 the complete story of Chris Chan's Chris Chan's interaction with Endless War to give the background
01:51:06 for the rain and stuff and like how that happened. I just wanted to put in context for like why that
01:51:13 happened. And I think I've got everything. What I had to do was I had to go through the the discord
01:51:19 logs itself and find like when she joined the server, when she got killed, the various times she
01:51:25 got killed, the things she said in response to being killed, which were very funny. Her like
01:51:29 making up commands like Moxby dash and goddess protection and stuff. I forgot that was her.
01:51:35 That the people made like the people were doing that. Yeah. No, it was funny. That was a funny meme.
01:51:41 It's you're there's some you're in some of like the chat logs because like there was like you
01:51:47 asked her like what her slime Sona would be and she replied with the the the card that was like
01:51:54 her like goddess Sonichu form and it's like I am immune to the slime and I move at bullet speed
01:51:59 so the slime can't catch me. Oh, there's a part there's a part after that where like what is it
01:52:07 hang on it's like she said she said oh god.
01:52:17 Yeah, you say like make a slime Sona and like and and and can he said if you if you die you can
01:52:25 revive in the sewers and Chris is just like I'm just visiting for now but I protect and I protect
01:52:31 myself and I dash as I am needed and you're just like nice and and Smirik says all ever
01:52:39 and all right and everyone's just like okay cool very cool just just the way that she the
01:52:46 literally the way that she's just like um actually uh I'm invincible actually like actually the rules
01:52:53 of the game don't apply to me like actually I just win honestly um this is very it's pretty it's
01:52:58 pretty funny uh and then she gets mad uh when she when she she she revived and then Dupati killed
01:53:06 her immediately and then she and then she she revives again but that this time she revives
01:53:13 and does goddess protection and goddess healing and says uh well I won't read the full text but
01:53:21 she wrote this long thing about like um I'm not actually in the server like I'm not actually dead
01:53:27 you didn't actually kill me uh you can't because I'm invincible uh by moxby dash
01:53:35 you know that stuff and I think the point is I think it's so juvenile but it's it's very funny
01:53:42 so I think I think I've I think I've fully collected all that and I'm like okay I'm done
01:53:47 I'm done I have everything I need uh and now now it's literally just like
01:53:53 fitted into the pages and I'm doing like a color coding thing where like different people's
01:53:57 taxes and different colors to like make it look nice and make it improve readability so I just
01:54:02 gotta do all that formatting and stuff and I won't I shouldn't complain I don't want to complain
01:54:07 about this anymore I talk about this too much I too much I'm too much talking not enough action
01:54:12 you know uh like that Elvis song just just like Elvis did I ever tell you did I mention that guy
01:54:19 who like Elvis Presley yeah the guy the kid who like lived in my old house
01:54:27 for a month or two and he like didn't know who Elvis was I I don't remember like he'd never hurt
01:54:33 there was I think his name was Jerry and he was a Chinese kid like he had grown up like half
01:54:40 he spoke perfectly good English because like he had spent much he had grown up somewhat in America
01:54:46 but also somewhat in China like he'd sort of been back and forth and he we had there was a for
01:54:53 summary our neighbors had an a party for like an older relative of theirs and they had an Elvis
01:54:58 impersonator and we were out in the yard like just you know observing this and Jerry did not know
01:55:05 who Elvis was and I just think that's remarkable
01:55:14 it is kind of like I remember in cartoons and stuff there would be like oh it's the Elvis
01:55:19 parody character Elvis is like a pop culture icon that Elvis Elvis is a people will know what it
01:55:25 means Elvis is a pop culture I don't do that anymore the shows do that does it did adventure time do
01:55:32 that um I can't remember if adventure time did it I mean adventure time is kind of old at this point
01:55:40 like a little bit nowadays nowadays these kids getting like these like teen dramas these cartoons
01:55:48 with okay serious stakes and they don't make Elvis jokes anymore not like the good old days not like
01:55:54 the good old days of adventure time like I mean Elvis was already old by the by the time adventure
01:55:59 time was out uh yeah of course he's he's my feeling my feeling is that Elvis is I mean Elvis was
01:56:07 already old by the time like I was growing up and like I had there were no shortage of Elvis
01:56:15 stuff I don't know I just I feel like he's a ubiquitous cultural icon who well pretty much
01:56:22 never completely go away I mean I know I'm from growing up but like I don't see Elvis
01:56:30 things so like I think it's quite possible you just don't come across it right now
01:56:37 unless you like the music and you continue to listen to the music I I you know honestly I would
01:56:43 have to be I can't really say because I don't like watch shows I don't really watch that much media
01:56:51 anymore so like maybe maybe Elvis references have ceased to be a thing in the time that Jerry was
01:56:58 growing up I feel like maybe maybe not just in shows but like a lot of entertainment is through
01:57:04 YouTube and what YouTuber would drop an Elvis reference I mean perhaps perhaps perhaps maybe
01:57:16 they'd reference memes Elvis doesn't have a meme that's the reason he doesn't have like a
01:57:21 big text low bottom text meme we used we used to call memes jokes back in the day
01:57:33 even Freddie Mercury had a meme yet that like hand like pose it turned into a rage comic thing
01:57:41 hand pose it's like he's got his hand way up and it's like fuck yeah it's like
01:57:48 I did it Freddie Mercury I saw that in rage comics maybe that that's definitely not used so much
01:57:56 anymore might have might have seen that if you if you want to live through post death if you want
01:58:04 to become an icon you've got to become a meme yeah it's like you know unfortunately Elvis died
01:58:12 before rage comics existed so there was never any hope that he would be memorialized unlike
01:58:18 Freddie Mercury who who was just born just in time just in time uh man the the the the feeling
01:58:32 I get I get a feeling uh from Disco Elysium whenever they talk about disco
01:58:38 uh I I feel Elysium no
01:58:47 no uh I just I feel the groove no just whenever the way they talk about disco as like basically
01:58:54 a trend that came and went uh I feel like I guess I've become old enough that like I understand
01:59:01 I understand the feeling of like hey that thing that I used to like that is completely like
01:59:06 everyone's over it and it's not a thing anymore really like I I now feel like I know what it's like
01:59:14 uh and I don't know I can I can relate I can relate that feeling to something like um I don't know
01:59:22 what's another what's another trend that came and went in my lifetime uh I emo scene kids I skateboarding
01:59:30 yeah skateboarding was like the huge skateboard culture in the nineties but now it's like
01:59:36 yeah I don't know sometimes you see somebody skating that's it yeah in real life that's all
01:59:43 I think I think so I was watching I saw a clip of some freaking uh some freaking hippies
01:59:51 some freaking hippies uh back in the day and I saw this clip of it they were being interviewed
01:59:58 and they were asking them like hey what's all this hippie stuff about and there was these three
02:00:03 white people that were they responded they were they were sitting in a big field
02:00:08 you know just hanging out lots of people were there white people and they were just like yeah
02:00:16 I just don't want to be like my parents you know like I just you know uh uh it's not all about
02:00:21 money it's not all about working it's about money it's just about living it's just about being
02:00:24 being in the vibe it's about vibing and like uh I agree I I get it and I agree with that but but
02:00:33 this tweet was presented and the kind was like you know like a lot of these hippies all went
02:00:36 on to become Reaganites right like these hippies that were all like a lot of them the white ones
02:00:43 in particular I mean I guess hippies being they weren't really black hippies no they were no that's
02:00:47 not true but like people like being a hippie pretty much meant nothing like politically like what do
02:00:52 you stand for it pretty much meant nothing it was just a cultural thing it was like a a a
02:00:57 a hedonism thing like someone like the black panthers would have had like a real like political
02:01:04 agenda but like the hippies were just kind of there to do drugs and have sex
02:01:10 and then they went on to vote for Reagan yeah and it and it's truly despicable
02:01:17 hippies these days vote for yang it still sucks I nothing's changed yang spoke the language of
02:01:28 the welfare state like yang made it sound like he wanted a more a a a an even velveteer glove
02:01:38 on the um on the budgetary policy and I like that it but it was all smoke and mirrors he was
02:01:47 just obfuscating his weird stupid tech bro thing I was I was fooled I was fooled but he deliberately
02:01:54 tried to fool me okay fool me once shame on him that's what I'm saying it's not my fault talk
02:02:02 about the the tweet where like yang was like sucking up to elon musk on twitter was that recent
02:02:09 I don't think it was recent but it was something that happened it was like okay yang whatever
02:02:13 um I don't remember that we already knew you were a little little bitch but now this is embarrassing
02:02:20 uh what do you say was it was it like post twitter takeover I think it must have been pre it was
02:02:26 wasn't that recent honestly I've seen like I've seen people like being I mean I've seen people
02:02:33 criticizing elon including people like mark cuban and stuff like even even fellow billionaires are
02:02:39 like um which is funny but I've also seen people being like oh like Stephen king was like way too
02:02:47 nice uh after like that after musk like Stephen Stephen hasn't had a brawl in his life he didn't
02:02:57 have a brawl uh uh no that's what I mean he's like oh yeah just like oh the slightest confrontation
02:03:03 no no no he's a lovely man I'm sure like yeah yeah didn't want to didn't want to start anything
02:03:07 terrible elon was being such a little bitch and and then for Stephen king just be like oh it's fine
02:03:14 oh he's just like no he's acting like a little pussy he's acting like an annoying little little
02:03:18 bitch to you call him a little cunt it's still funny to me that like Stephen king's comment about
02:03:26 it's too expensive and then elon was like what if I change it what if I lower it to eight and then
02:03:31 that's the number yeah because Stephen king turned it into an eight dollar thing that is funny that
02:03:37 it's just because Stephen king said it was too expensive that's pretty good um damn I can't believe
02:03:45 it anytime I see I can't believe the kind of accounts that I see subscribe to fucking twitter
02:03:50 blue I don't I genuinely don't understand I'll see some people with like with like 50 followers
02:03:55 that are subscribed to twitter blue it's like why what are you spending that eight dollars for
02:04:00 they like the check mark I is that literally is that literally it I mean I don't know I think
02:04:08 twitter blue has a bunch of like fluff that it says that you can get if you subscribe so like
02:04:14 stuff that doesn't matter at all yeah on honestly I would kind of understand I don't like it but I
02:04:20 kind of understand if someone is like like a business account like if someone is like livelihood
02:04:25 is like some business that they run and they promote using their twitter account I could
02:04:29 kind of understand that like you know if if twitter blue promises like greater reach or
02:04:34 priority to your tweets or whatever I can understand who'd be like well if I don't get that it'll hurt
02:04:39 my sales or whatever yeah but if you're just some guy with like a hundred followers
02:04:47 why what what would you even get out of it it's either dick sucking or yeah it's like it's like
02:04:56 virtue signal it's like a kind of virtue signaling yeah it's like I'm doing my part to make this website
02:05:02 be the uh the uh starship troopers I'm doing my part um catching yeah
02:05:13 I want to ah no no reason to bring this up I just I had a big nostalgia thing a few days ago
02:05:20 about a bunch of British shows but of course you don't know any of them so is your point
02:05:25 bring it up I probably don't I mean unless you want to just throw some names out and see if
02:05:29 I've heard of any of them uh yeah I mean there's no way they're like well now I'm curious yeah uh
02:05:37 Bernhard's watch no show about a kid who has a watch that stops time and he does things when
02:05:43 the time is stopped and I remember the cinematography being like wow how do they pause it how do they
02:05:49 pause real life it's very compelling uh no they things didn't have gravity when they were paused
02:05:57 it was like 90s or late 80s like visual effects I remember liking that just freeze just freeze frame
02:06:04 just freeze frame and green screen yeah and then you can move around in them uh that was a fun one
02:06:11 there was uh my parents are aliens my parents the aliens come to earth they disguise themselves as
02:06:20 human adults and uh they get some kids from the orphanage and they have a wacky fun time it's a
02:06:26 sitcom interesting and and the parents don't know what human life is and the orphans have to the
02:06:32 the kids have to explain to them and they have to make sure no one finds out that their parents are
02:06:37 I think the joke is that oh your parents are cool or your parents are like a little odd but nobody
02:06:43 ever suspects alien I did read um my my teacher is an alien which was a series of books as a kid
02:06:51 you know those nope you know they're a series of of you know young fairly young children's novels
02:06:59 but you know they're they're like they're like animorphs but like aimed even younger uh and
02:07:06 you know I actually follow the author of those books on on uh on twitter you know I realized
02:07:14 thinking back I feel like I might have said this before but I'll say it again uh I saw that guy on
02:07:19 twitter his name is Bruce Coville and I was like oh he's the guy who wrote those books that I read
02:07:24 as a kid and I remembered I remembered that like uh those books kind of have a pretty like they sort
02:07:33 of have a pretty like big business bad uh uh they have a pretty like leftist uh uh like politics
02:07:42 sort of current under cutting them especially in like the the the last one it sort of gets like
02:07:48 the it talks about like how the aliens like see the earth and like all the all the problems that
02:07:53 are on earth and a lot of it is like yeah resources are being hoarded by like you know individuals
02:07:59 when there's enough to go around but it's not being shared due to like economic reasons
02:08:03 and I was like oh wow wait a minute Bruce Coville is based actually he told me that communism was
02:08:10 good when I was a little child he groomed me and I appreciate it um so yeah oh and now he just
02:08:20 tweets about how like you know republicans are bad I'm like yes thank you Bruce you're right
02:08:26 good good man keep keep doing what you're doing what were you saying uh here's a show that I think
02:08:33 did come to America but it's under a different name or maybe it came from America probably that
02:08:37 way direction uh jungle run put a link uh jungle run is like they're in the jungle and it's a bunch
02:08:45 of kids and they have to do obstacle courses to get the jewels in the crystal caves and the monkeys
02:08:51 are gonna throw bananas at them and they have to like it's really cool is it like um did you ever
02:08:57 see a legend of the hidden temple yeah I think that's the I don't know if they're like directly like
02:09:04 the same show but like ones from the UK and ones from the US like the same production company sold
02:09:11 the rights or whatever yeah it but it's not the same name so maybe not I mean it's a it's a
02:09:16 different uh different set and everything yeah it's all filmed in the UK or or somewhere
02:09:22 and it's like this is from 2002 yeah oh this was I mean I think uh I don't I don't know if
02:09:29 legend of the hidden temple was still running in 2002 yeah maybe is maybe it's a spiritual successor
02:09:37 perhaps but I really love jungle oh that kid fell in the water ha ha ha lol he fell in the brown
02:09:42 water gross you that water I really that they had a thing where at the very end of the thing they had
02:09:51 like a big monkey head and based on your success in the trials proceeding it uh you had a certain
02:09:57 amount of seconds oh my to go in there and do a puzzle and collect uh one of three monkey statues
02:10:05 there's a bronze a silver and a gold one and if you did really well on the puzzle and if you did
02:10:10 if you had a lot of seconds in order to do you know really well you could get the gold one but
02:10:14 then you had to grab it and you have to run out before the monkey mouth closes and when the monkey
02:10:20 mouth closes um the show acts like the children are locked in there forever and they'll die because
02:10:28 they they took too long they got like too greedy they got freaking uh uh Aladdin like giant jaguar head
02:10:36 yeah uh the mouth closed the mouth closed and they're like and the presenter would be like
02:10:42 ah looks like they're not coming back and I when I was a kid I was like no they're dead I was so
02:10:49 scared I didn't want to apply to this show that's awesome I really wanted to do it but like what if
02:10:54 I died that was my thought process I remember that very specifically but like what if I died though
02:10:59 what if I die in the monkey head I don't want to risk that damn I really like this show but like
02:11:04 all those kids freaking die on it all the time like that's a bummer Sid and Elvis the fucking
02:11:10 orangutans those men and like those people in monkey costumes are so awkward looking
02:11:17 yeah they're pretty cheap looking yeah just throwing shit
02:11:26 oh and why are the kids why are the kids and the host all wearing these like weird costumes
02:11:31 with weird rubber masks oh wait they're just British oh dear tragic um
02:11:38 um jungle no I never heard of that I want to play this in real life I want an escape room
02:11:46 that's like a real huge jungle that I can run through I think I think I would I think I would
02:11:54 find that escape rooms annoying if I tried them in real life I don't know I don't think I would
02:11:58 enjoy them I I don't think so either I think there's something about it being just a room
02:12:04 and you're usually with a group of people but when I'm doing like a point and click escape room
02:12:09 like like a game yeah it's like oh it's spooky and I'm not trying to figure out all of the stuff
02:12:17 and I'm pondering to myself and I'm thinking and I'm finding clues but in an escape rooms that I've
02:12:22 seen you got a group of friends and you're like oh what's this what's that and I would feel so annoyed
02:12:27 if I wasn't the guy who found the clue I was just looking in the wrong place I was like okay well I
02:12:32 guess we're moving on I think I would feel the same way the fact that you're doing it with the group
02:12:38 all also the fact even if I was doing it by myself the fact that like I know that I'm being observed
02:12:43 like like the people that like hosts but like the people that make the room would are like watching
02:12:48 you and like they give you sure you're not jacking off and they give you hints if you need it and
02:12:52 stuff and like I think that would just really unsettle me and like really take me out of it
02:12:58 just knowing that and then also yeah but you're doing it with a group is like even more so like
02:13:04 I have to like I can't just like focus on the thing I have to like also be interacting with
02:13:09 this group and I think it would take me out of it and I think I would just be like rolling my eyes
02:13:14 I think I would I think I would find clues or whatever and I would just roll my eyes like oh
02:13:19 okay they're doing a oh it's a murder mystery oh I found this the murder note uh they the the
02:13:27 theme uh corny but then find it really corny I think my my my gamer brain and my socializing
02:13:33 brain are so different like I feel like trying to do one or the other would like ruin something
02:13:41 like if I tried to play the game I would be so anti-social yeah if I tried to be social I wouldn't
02:13:46 be paying attention to what's around me yeah that makes sense I think I I definitely I think I would
02:13:55 feel pretty much the same about that um anyway British people in the comments comment shows
02:14:03 that you remember and also if you remember the ones I said and say oh my god childhood unlocked
02:14:11 click uh well I don't believe it I don't believe any of these are real they're this proof they're
02:14:19 all too real unfortunately uh Bernard's watch give me a fucking oh that's that's like a fake show
02:14:29 that I would make up if I was like writing about all right let me fucking type in Bernard's watch
02:14:34 I see it I see it here um another one art attack and brom art attack art attack is legendary
02:14:44 dick it oh I see dick and dom and de bungalow I type my parents are aliens I type my parents
02:14:50 are aliens and it gave me a bunch of related searches and yeah I see yeah it's the same
02:14:54 it's the same oh brum oh that's like baby childhood the story of Tracy beaker Tracy beaker
02:15:02 that's another big one they roll on like it was like cbbc and c itv but like itv and bbc
02:15:10 children's programming slots how many how many letters how many letters are you lgbtq people
02:15:17 how do you how many letters do you need they're two different networks I see it i tv c itv
02:15:23 is the children's version of itv which is usually channel three and then bbc was channel one and two
02:15:30 mm-hmm and cbbc is a different channel the children's bbc and we switched between them
02:15:36 because they had everything there was no ads well i think on c itv there were ads but
02:15:42 it was just a bunch of cool shows all in a row very rarely was there like an american show
02:15:50 maybe just keep your mind keep your mind pure arthur came in arthur was a big one
02:15:55 um
02:15:57 wasn't arthur like no i was canadian wasn't arthur british like wasn't the
02:16:02 original author actually i don't i don't even know that uh no i'm just probably probably not
02:16:11 arthur developed by kathy wall animated educational television series pbs
02:16:20 i was created no created by american author mark brown nope i'm wrong yeah
02:16:26 there's um rupert bear who looks nothing like him but he has the similar jumper
02:16:35 not familiar not familiar yeah he's got a he's got a jumper on i don't even remember what rupert
02:16:42 bear was like i remember having like a color like a watercolor children's book of him and he was a bear
02:16:49 and boy howdy he wasn't quite winnie the pooh but he was something he sure was
02:17:00 is rupert bear older than winnie the pooh the character is six years older than winnie the pooh
02:17:05 whoa original bear 1928 he's he's the original bear yeah
02:17:13 okay okay now i've seen this guy i've seen this guy somewhere
02:17:21 paddington bear is another one
02:17:26 not someone's hacking up a lung out in my hallway uh is paddington older than winnie the pooh
02:17:32 no paddington's a lot younger okay
02:17:35 yeah 1926 was rupert bear paddington was 1958 he was a 60s bear or almost 60s
02:17:48 when and when was winnie the pooh uh 1932 um no no the the the latin translation is from
02:18:05 the the fifties lull uh okay 1926 yeah the 20s uh so damn he's almost a hundred he's almost
02:18:14 100 years old yes i mean rupert bear is 100 years old he's 103 102 he's just fucking christ
02:18:24 and what has he done with that time wait a minute a winnie the pooh was edward bear in 1924
02:18:32 what hang on this is a this is a we got to go down this bear hole yeah the the first winnie the
02:18:39 pooh story was called when we were very young but the bear in it is called edward even though it's
02:18:46 definitely the same bear fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear created by english author a.a nilne
02:18:53 we got like a monopoly on bears over here we made paddington as well
02:18:58 what bears have you got you got like um we have like uh we have we have teddy we have teddy
02:19:03 roosevelt the the the original teddy bear the theodore that's pretty big one yeah sorry sorry
02:19:11 idiot yeah which president was he or uh that would have to be um who was who was the one who like
02:19:21 didn't talk much uh donald trump never spoke a word that guy
02:19:27 coolage calvin coolage was he or uh who is rabbit which american president is rabbit um
02:19:38 oh man i'm trying i'm trying to think if there if there's a if there's a an american president
02:19:43 no is it andrew jackson he was cantankerous i don't know anything about american presidents
02:19:49 except that lincoln had a beard um the the the story and it's probably apocryphal but the story
02:19:56 about calvin coolage is that like a woman he was he was famously a man of few words and at a party
02:20:04 a woman said to him uh like my friend my friend bet like i bet my friend my friend bet me that i
02:20:11 couldn't get you to say three words to me and he replied you lose uh
02:20:20 that's fun yeah it's a funny a funny anecdote who knows if it's true or not
02:20:26 he could have said fuck off yeah fuck you better
02:20:35 he said die and he pulled out a gun
02:20:42 uh um um who's the tigger uh bill clinton um who's the who's the rue uh taft uh uh
02:20:54 what about the kanga uh hillary clinton oh wait
02:21:02 owl i forgot what the hell is like uh well i was gonna say smart but
02:21:11 actually no he's just pompous he's pompous and he thinks he's smart but he's not
02:21:18 and christopher robin is joe biden autobiography christopher yeah he's christopher robinette biden
02:21:29 this is like this is the new um the new like instead of you never heard people say that like
02:21:33 the winnie the pooh characters are all different like mental disorders uh yeah i think i heard that
02:21:39 yeah like pooh is adhd uh eeyore's depression uh owl is like narcissism or maybe uh
02:21:49 it's not a disorder it is narcissistic personality disorder is uh it's like a b cluster or whatever
02:21:56 you call it might yeah um i don't think of it as a disorder but i guess so it's a it's a personality
02:22:04 disorder like uh like like bpd it's one of those big penis discharge what does that mean
02:22:11 borderline borderline personality disorder not by not bipolar disorder that's not bpd
02:22:20 borderline personality disorder and that they borderline have a personality borderline personality
02:22:28 disorder i don't know it's just one of those it's just a particular kind of shitty personality
02:22:33 that you might have i don't know i'm not exactly sure what what what's the line between like when
02:22:39 are when do you have a personality disorder and when are you just have a shitty personality
02:22:44 and i maybe there is no difference maybe there is no line yeah uh although i know that people
02:22:50 with with like personality disorders like that i guess like they i've heard they's like they have
02:22:56 to manage their symptoms right like people like like apparently like you can have narcissistic
02:23:00 personality disorder but you can have it but you like you just have to like keep in mind that
02:23:05 you have it all the time and like adjust your natural adjust how you behave to like go against
02:23:11 your natural inclinations just based on knowledge of like okay i know that i'm just my disorder
02:23:16 thinking makes me feel like i should do this but i know that that's like a narcissistic thing to do
02:23:21 and so i should do this other thing instead um so i mean i don't know sounds i don't know
02:23:31 so you're you're just remember that you're depressed all the time and just try to be happy
02:23:36 okay and just smile instead smile you're you're pretty when you smile okay i guess uh well he
02:23:44 you know he he comes he goes up to the clouds he goes up to watch the clouds when he's happy
02:23:49 yeah and now he's got six wives and now yes and they've cured his his depression
02:23:57 i wonder um okay at least two at least two of his wives are like mother and daughter
02:24:06 possibly more that's weird right that is weird but is it illegal is it fucked up i don't
02:24:17 i don't know that it's illegal well well i mean hmm is it fucked up i mean they're not they're not
02:24:26 married to each other they're married to you they're they're like well yeah i guess i don't
02:24:31 know the terminology for like polygonal polygonal polygonal um polygamous marriages like what do you
02:24:39 say to to the two wives what are they to do each other i mean sisters but not really in yeah in like
02:24:47 Mormon polygamy i've heard them call each other sister wives and i mean i guess they are like
02:24:54 since they each parallel lives i mean your if your sibling married a woman they would be your
02:25:02 sister-in-law so if your spouse marries a woman well okay if you're that'll be your lover-in-law
02:25:13 are you are you also okay okay i think i think are you your own sibling uh if you are if you are
02:25:23 your own sibling then i think i would say that you are also your spouses that you are also your
02:25:30 spouse's in-law as well as their spouse and therefore your spouse's spouse is another of your
02:25:39 in-law so you are sister-in-laws well i think as well as fellow wives with your spouse's spouse
02:25:47 well i looked up the word sibling sibling is a relative that shares at least one parent with
02:25:52 the subject so it's it's it's your your only a sibling in relation to someone else i mean sure
02:25:59 you can't be your own i feel intuitively i feel like yeah i mean i guess technically you're not
02:26:08 your own in-law and you're not your own sibling but like you have you have you other than the fact
02:26:14 that you are yourself and not another person you meet all the criteria of being a sibling
02:26:20 with your own siblings and all the criteria of being an in-law with your in-laws you know what i'm
02:26:27 saying i guess to me it intuitively makes sense that you would that you are that if you are you
02:26:34 and another woman are both married to the same guy you are sister in-laws even though a tech i guess
02:26:41 an in-law is your sibling's spouse or your spouse's sibling and your spouse is not your sibling your
02:26:50 spouse is not your sibling unless it's not de facto your sibling well okay but if your if
02:26:58 your sibling if your sibling marries someone they become your in your sibling in-law so i feel like
02:27:07 if you marry someone i guess you wouldn't become a sibling in-law because you are not your own sibling
02:27:15 they just become yourself in-law because you are yourself i have no idea what you're getting at
02:27:21 i'm saying it's like you're even i just feel like the relationship of an in-law is satisfied
02:27:32 if you marry i feel like you you you you you are your spouse's in-law and therefore your spouse's
02:27:39 spouse is another of your in-laws and therefore you are in a certain sense a sibling in-law
02:27:49 of your fellow polygamous wives i don't think you ever thought about this hence the term sister
02:27:55 wives i think so so is so is it incest no is it incest if you marry a mother and daughter you are
02:28:05 are you or are you merely rendering them are you rendering them siblings in-law of one another
02:28:11 and is this is this evil or is this good it would be it would be like adjacent to evil but not
02:28:21 literally evil can we arrest your why did he do it he's he's tearing the powers family apart
02:28:29 with his with his with his pure riz he's so irresistible to these powers women that he's his
02:28:36 charisma is destroying their family we've got to do something about it i keep i mean he is like a
02:28:41 little stuffed animal it makes sense that they all want to hug him so cute what i maybe they have
02:28:47 like a maybe they have like a uh uh uh what's the word a platonic marriage maybe they don't
02:28:55 fuck uh yeah maybe hmm has your ever fucked in the show don't i don't think so uh not to my
02:29:03 knowledge not to my knowledge did kangaroo make roux did she be pregnant are you asking if
02:29:11 ira is roux's dad no i'm just saying to these animals is is uh conceit conception possible
02:29:19 i know they're all plush toys and it's all in on christopher robin's head except it's not it's real
02:29:23 it's real it's real um i mean i guess the implication is that rue is she gave birth to him
02:29:30 even though that never actually happened who's the dad that's the that's the new show that's a new
02:29:35 episode here here's here's what i'm confused about okay in the in the eor group one of the
02:29:40 wives is laura powers and one of the wives is ruth powers and that is ruth is laura's mom but
02:29:47 there's also someone called ruth jr ruth powers jr but like who the fuck is that it's probably like a
02:29:55 flashback episode younger version or i mean i can't find any um i can't find any reference to
02:30:04 ruth powers jr granddaughter that's not that's not how that works i don't know who is this person
02:30:13 i don't see in the image died died i gotta find it i got i got to find it again ben hughes
02:30:20 all right here we go here here in this one he mentions ruth powers jr eorn is wait he's only
02:30:27 got four wives ruth powers laura powers ours and taylor and ruth powers jr wait a minute so what happened
02:30:33 to the other two because there were six he had six girlfriends but he only married four of them
02:30:40 what did the other six do wrong where's this on the timeline i was this yesterday yeah this is
02:30:47 he divorced two of them already i don't i think he just didn't marry them but didn't wasn't there a
02:30:52 thing with his six wives like wasn't that i must have misread he no he had six girlfriends but
02:30:58 according to the suite he only has four wives and i just want to know the whole story okay i just
02:31:03 want to i just want to understand laughed at captain caveman's battle cry and the director
02:31:08 said hey that's funny maybe okay maybe he has six wives but only four of them were just included in
02:31:15 this scene yeah maybe he has more wives i think i think he probably married he did marry all six
02:31:21 i mean i i'm gonna i think i should assume that until proven maybe on january first okay i'm gonna
02:31:28 scroll back to january first and see if i can find a reference oh okay eor and his six wives ruth
02:31:36 powers laura powers alison taylor laura powers b what ruth powers junior and alice and sister the
02:31:45 babysitter what the fuck laura powers b and ruth powers junior oh oh oh under the the tweet you
02:31:55 posted somebody said this is epic ben but is it really okay for er to marry a kid ben replies it is okay
02:32:03 oh okay thanks for clearing that up thank you for clearing that up for me i wasn't sure
02:32:16 holy fuck uh this is this this changes everything it's just cutting right through the bullshit it
02:32:23 is okay it's okay if you were wondering oh i found it i found the canon
02:32:30 eor and his six girlfriends got married wait a minute there's another one
02:32:37 there's a whole bunch of stuff on the first eor and his six eor today is eor and six girls's wedding
02:32:45 i can't i can't believe it um oh it's it's it's remarkable he didn't say he didn't say she's not
02:32:54 a kid he said yes it is okay to marry a kid for eor to marry a kid i just i want okay who is ruth
02:33:02 powers junior who is laura powers b that's uh that's the mystery that's the mystery laura powers
02:33:11 b i died no idea maybe i should just ask him yeah it is okay that's that's incredible all right i'm
02:33:21 i'm probably gonna ask him like who who are these two other people are they like alternate
02:33:28 timeline versions maybe it's like maybe it's like ruth as shown in like a flashback episode
02:33:36 i can't get over his his filmmaking style of like playing a clip pausing moving to another
02:33:43 tab where he's prepared the reaction shot in a different video yeah plays that pauses next one
02:33:50 like does he know that he could put these clips into like a free program like vegas and he could
02:33:57 just like he could cut i feel like he would enjoy it i think he would he would enjoy the the product
02:34:03 of that more i i don't know i feel like that's a whole lot of steps it's easier just to set him
02:34:12 all up and then get your phone out record him i guess i mean i think he could do it
02:34:21 well see you know i see no reason he wouldn't be able to do it so well i is it maybe this is just
02:34:30 yeah this method of record different tabs with my phone maybe that's that's good enough that
02:34:37 that gets him where he needs to be he just made a tweet and he says elephant race period yeah it's
02:34:44 a picture of elephant race yeah it's not like it's something he edited it's just a picture
02:34:52 uh well didn't he put like um oh yeah it is just a picture there was one from my show
02:34:58 there was one where he put yeah yeah uh team i like this one a lot team eor at the burrow race
02:35:04 with ruth powers laura powers and arison taylor as racers and eor as the starter
02:35:10 he's at uh he's at uh uh what's that cat's name
02:35:17 uh hang on did you post that or yeah yeah i just posted it oh um oh yeah i know it from
02:35:29 hannah barbarus stuff i don't remember what he's from he like edited a smile onto one of the
02:35:35 is that ruth powers b
02:35:39 is it because she's wearing a different outfit is this like a different time different episode
02:35:47 okay it looks to me i just i just don't know
02:35:52 no one of his girlfriends is just the same as his other girlfriend but wearing a different shirt
02:36:04 he just likes the fit he can't he can't decide he has to have both two people this guy's got a
02:36:11 type this guy's got a type and it's this specific family lineage from the simpsons
02:36:17 it looks like in the burrow race like cut off of the torso cut off at like the crotch area and then
02:36:23 just standing yeah alison is just standing there she's got her full her full feet good for her
02:36:31 i like that they're on a blue background to sort of blend into the sky it's good it's a good effort
02:36:36 it's that's attention to detail that i appreciate that is and you could do vegas stuff well so vegas
02:36:42 isn't free it's not a free program no you have to pirate it uh you've had it for so long you forgot
02:36:49 yeah i did okay i mean fine windows movie maker then if you're just gonna cut clips together
02:36:56 yeah that they're perfectly serviceable yeah i should go to the bathroom i'll be back in a second
02:37:02 all right i guess i'll go as well okay i'm back you there mm yeah um what's up uh
02:37:11 uh you know let's explore that
02:37:16 oh i played um i played the madagascar ps2 video game
02:37:21 yeah what was that like not too long ago it's good it's like a good little platformer is it
02:37:27 like a collectathon yeah you collect some stuff uh you basically you got some levels where you got
02:37:34 to do the events of the movie and you got like uh all the characters from the film and they're
02:37:42 not voice acted by their voice actors but the voice actors do a very good job of impersonating
02:37:47 uh they got they got the old uh dan castellanetta impersonating robin williams uh syndrome
02:37:56 huh well you know in in um you know the genie was robin williams but then in all the non in all
02:38:05 the like sequels and all the adaptations he's voiced by dan castellanetta doing his best robin
02:38:10 williams impersonation yeah well it's not because robin williams is like fuck you pay me maybe it's
02:38:18 not uh it's not really about that he didn't get paid it's that like he had a sort of weird kind
02:38:26 of like uh thing where like he he really i don't know i don't know how if i should really believe
02:38:33 this but what i've heard is that he just really didn't want the movie to be like super like
02:38:40 commercialized and he didn't want to like make the movie about him and he didn't like want it to
02:38:46 have any sequels and so when it had sequels he didn't want to like come back right like i think
02:38:51 i think they did a commodity or whatever i think he liked the movie and he wanted to be part of it
02:38:56 but he didn't want it to um like be he didn't want to like sell the movie like on his as like a robin
02:39:05 williams product or something or he he didn't like i don't know that's what i've heard and that sounds
02:39:10 like it's honestly as i say it i'm like that sounds like some robin williams like apologia
02:39:15 that sounds like some very like oh he's just such a he's just such a visionary he didn't
02:39:19 like the commercialism of it like robin williams is not bill waterson maybe he is i don't know
02:39:27 i heard he was cool but i don't know i i never met him that sounds very flattering it's probably
02:39:34 more like there was beef it's probably there was beef for some reason and the and the the robin
02:39:41 williams side the pro robin williams side of it is he didn't like the way that it was like marketed
02:39:49 and and and he didn't like the idea of there being sequels and stuff so he just didn't come back for
02:39:53 them i think that's fair perhaps but uh the i looked up because i was the you know um chris
02:40:03 rock does the zebra in madagascar martin zebra yeah um the voice actor in the game
02:40:10 was exactly like chris rock i was like did they really get because this game was like
02:40:15 it's sort of it's a ps2 a licensed game and it's pretty small scope like it's got a bunch of levels
02:40:24 and then you play them and then you win and as one does and you know the animation's great and the
02:40:32 graphics are quite good and it's like nice and the voice acting is like how do they really get
02:40:37 the voice actors and i looked it up and it's not chris rock it's actually a guy who does i need to
02:40:44 find him um he did the voice of sam ray jack and like a like a billion other things uh i probably
02:40:55 would have heard his name uh phil lamar hmm okay sounds sort of familiar phil lamar did a trillion
02:41:07 voices in video games and cartoons and it's it was so funny not funny it is cool uh being like wow
02:41:16 he's that and this and this i forget exactly what it was known for pulp fiction was he pulp fiction
02:41:27 oh he's hermes and futurama oh that's like uh was it fry fry being voice was also voiced by
02:41:36 he was voiced by ren stimpy was the name the name's like billy something i don't know voice of fry
02:41:46 billy west yeah billy west was also a ren stimpy oh he was he was the name the voice of kit fisto
02:41:53 and jar jar binks on the lego star wars game oh only in the game not in the movie no the lego
02:42:01 star wars game yeah yeah yeah exactly they didn't have a lego star wars movie holy shit
02:42:07 that would be cool no i mean playing with lego yes i know but i mean that he didn't voice those
02:42:12 characters in the movie they got him for the lego version of the game yeah
02:42:19 it's just so many oh kit fisto is that the the the boundary no he's a tentacle headed
02:42:26 green lightsaber guy jedi oh yeah right okay sure
02:42:35 i don't call him kit fisto because he's into chicks if you know what i mean
02:42:43 i don't that's what this is a plinket said i remember okay yeah in the original samurai jack
02:42:50 he did samurai jack and basically every other character on that show
02:42:54 really did they um i'm not sure if he did aku but like he did did they like bring samurais jack
02:43:02 back for like a final season yeah it's called samurai back really no oh uh yeah i saw someone
02:43:12 talking about the last season of samurai jack and i think i had forgot but like i think i think
02:43:22 like they brought it back like later and they did like a more like adult uh uh like sort of like
02:43:29 final run of episodes kind of like how they brought future on back but i'm not sure i just
02:43:35 saw people talking about it and i was like maybe i didn't catch that part i'm scrolling oh my god i'm
02:43:41 still in 2016 i'm sorry but like look look at this one look at this 18 er in scooby-doo and guess
02:43:49 who it's the who guess who it is did you know um some of these in at least one of these uh
02:43:58 er is no longer friends with like christopher robin and the the hundred acre wood crowd like
02:44:03 he's moved he's moved out of there and he's he's he's cut his ties dang yeah i i guess i don't know
02:44:12 if like maybe he didn't like how like they bullied him or something he didn't like tigger like breaking
02:44:17 his little stupid little shack they didn't like him being having a polygamous relationship with six
02:44:23 women yeah but he converted to Mormonism and they're like dude isn't that like a cult and he's like

02:44:58 they're not always like the main character but sometimes it is and it's like wow
02:45:05 what a guy what it that guy works that's that's a working that's a working man
02:45:14 good for him you know yeah it was marvin and pulp fiction who's marvin

02:51:02 i had a knight wish i had a guy with a shield to block attacks directed against me that's why you
02:51:09 need large stacks of cash so you can buy one exactly a knight in armor bodyguard
02:51:19 cc mentions poo's adventures you remember poo's adventures uh is that different from poo general
02:51:29 poo's adventures of was like a sort of like trend among people that don't know how to make videos
02:51:36 where they would like crudely cut together footage of winnie the pooh with like other cartoons
02:51:43 in order to make like poo's adventures of the little mermaid which is just basically you
02:51:49 like cut reaction shots of winnie the poo into the little mermaid to sort of pretend that like
02:51:54 the cast of winnie the poo is part of the plot of little mermaid for example i've never seen that it
02:52:01 i discovered this rabbit hole a while ago a long time ago years ago actually and
02:52:12 you know i considered trying to make like a video about it or honestly i wonder if there's like a
02:52:17 i wonder if there's a lecture in that you know what i'm gonna make a note i might look into this uh
02:52:23 i'm gonna put it in my little uh uh uh uh word document uh all right next one is um
02:52:37 more image more there's so many images i'm so tired so tired of images the treachery of images
02:52:46 did you know in order to prepare for his role as a deranged killer in the movie joker
02:52:50 actor Joaquin Phoenix joined the pcp minecraft server and you too can become a deranged killer
02:52:56 link down in the description uh to join the pcp minecraft server discord server which will explain
02:53:02 to you how to get it set up and oh yeah since my internet works now uh we should do uh we should
02:53:07 do a stream soon we should we should hop on the pcp minecraft server baby have a little have a
02:53:13 little mine a little craft we should have a little mine yeah we should we should craft a mine or two
02:53:18 i think it could be good um i'll do it did you skip one did i i don't think so uh i think i think
02:53:27 you skipped uh this oh the homogenous this one oh oh homogenous i do get it do you get it
02:53:41 yeah it's geno it's geno but it's not geno from super mario uh legend of the starry boy no no no no
02:53:53 no no not not the same guy not the same guy no relation but i do get it though so the next one
02:54:02 um yeah okay mage's dreams versus ben's i hate cheesies i mean it's just true
02:54:16 yeah is this relating to something you said last episode or is it just no it was a couple
02:54:20 episodes ago i just had i woke up from a random dream in which i just was on twitter uh no not
02:54:27 on twitter on discord just saying how much i hate cheesie manfredo and then i woke up and i
02:54:33 thought why did i dream of that i said that um you looks like such a sack of potatoes yeah
02:54:40 beard beard's coming like a fake purple onesie beard's coming in good though
02:54:44 beard's coming in good this is nice this is a nice drawing it is a nice drawing is that is
02:54:49 that is that who's that goblin watching me i thought it was batman i think it's a goblin
02:54:56 in shadow batman doesn't have pupils when he's wearing his cowl oh yeah not in his animated form
02:55:05 anyway um this is just funny what's with that maze it's like a distant like hedge maze on that hill
02:55:15 yeah i don't know i thought it was just decorate they could be a maze volcano in theory in theory
02:55:22 amage's dream is more interesting it's more fantastical but i would argue that a hearing
02:55:26 the minutiae of it is not great but you know what the different strokes for different folks i guess
02:55:33 and streams are more psychologically damaging yes they're more about the human heart and
02:55:41 conflict with itself which is the only thing worth writing about as they say um okay why don't
02:55:48 we keep posting this one uh fuck in hell all right the next one is otjdern dot jpeg
02:56:00 i mean what am i what am i supposed to say to this uh i mean are you pogging or are you cringing
02:56:10 you look pretty mad they they trapped you looks like i look like i'm cringing but i think i might
02:56:16 just be pogging too hard that like my face doesn't know what to do anymore i look terrible in this
02:56:21 picture i look so bad at redcon too holy shit and i read that's redcon three
02:56:28 yeah you're right well i look bad there too you're wearing the worst there yeah what is this backdrop
02:56:34 just a random it makes me think of breaking bad but it might just be a random desert shot i guess
02:56:41 it's not even the desert because there's trees who won't somebody somebody please
02:56:47 help me remember who these girls are they're from old comic i just i want to know what the
02:56:52 comic is it is it called are they called jenny jenny and benny i might be thinking of i think
02:57:02 they're called jenny does this is such a mystery and somebody knows because they keep
02:57:13 oh i think yeah yeah somebody knows oh god uh okay no i searched
02:57:20 hmm yeah no i searched jenny boob's comic and i got some
02:57:25 interaction results seems to be yeah different this is not what i this is unrelated this is
02:57:33 not what i was looking for okay um you got to keep coming back to the pcp so eventually we'll
02:57:43 find out what this is that's the that's the long-running hook we got right the moment like what the
02:57:48 fuck i just where are these people from i know that it's a thing that people have seen because
02:57:56 i've seen it and there were threads about it it was mentioned in threads on something awful
02:58:02 and i just uh but i uh i can't remember one of these days one of these days um okay anyway
02:58:14 next one is i like apple right three two one go favor fruit favor fruit aesthetically i
02:58:28 like the taste of apple yeah quite a lot um um i think raspberry probably is my favorite because
02:58:36 of the sharpness i mean i like like raspberry like candy i kind of don't really like eating
02:58:42 raspberries on their own because they have they're so mushy they're like a mushy consistency
02:58:47 okay they're good with like an ice cream thing yeah or just cream um i like um passion fruit
02:58:57 but i don't know i've never like eat just eaten one and i kind of think that it's like not great
02:59:03 to just eat but like the flavor of it like put into other things is my favorite um
02:59:09 is rhubarb a fruit definitely not definitely not it's a rhubarb fleshy it's a stem
02:59:17 it's a stem of of what of the rhubarb plant oh it's yeah it's very sweet i like rhubarb crumble so
02:59:27 oh sure that's where my mind went sure but i mean it's it's sweet because they add sugar to it but
02:59:32 like the actual no the i mean i guess you've never just tried raw rhubarb but it's yeah i
02:59:39 guess not but it's literally just the stem of of a plant and it's just like sour oh well i like
02:59:46 the sour part sure it's good i like it too you know when you add something sweet to it it makes a
02:59:52 nice a nice blend of flavor uh kind of like how lemons are really sour but it's really nice if to
02:59:58 make lemonade out of when you add sugar to it um i guess i like sour but it's but it's definitely
03:00:04 not a fruit because a fruit is like it contains the seeds uh and a stem is not stem is not a fruit
03:00:12 i don't think the rhubarb plant doesn't even have fruits or maybe it does maybe it has like
03:00:18 flower little flowers that make little seeds at some point just we don't eat them
03:00:23 i like lemon flavor i'm trying to think of my favorite fruit to just eat is and i honestly
03:00:30 oh grapefruits oh no definitely grapefruits i love grapefruits i should try grapefruit
03:00:36 well you you never tried one no i just never got around to it i was just like my video games
03:00:41 that's gonna be like a long list of fruits i haven't gotten around to yet you know you know that would
03:00:47 that would disturb me greatly except that i have met other people who have just like never had
03:00:51 grapefruit and like i guess it's some people just don't i can't i like them a lot they're my favorite
03:01:02 uh they're juicy uh uh sometimes they're bad okay sometimes they're bad sometimes they can be a
03:01:08 little dry if you get a bad one that's like dry that sucks but if you get a nice juicy one
03:01:13 uh it's perfect oh it's perfect some people put sugar on theirs i don't understand it i don't think
03:01:18 they need additional sugar did i tell you did i mention what happened that guy who has like moved
03:01:25 in to my house uh who cooks in the kitchen and i made fun of them when i called him a famine
03:01:34 i remember you talking about that last week there there was i listened to that part yeah
03:01:38 well there was a funny story uh that guy like i guess he was eating Cheerios and he was trying
03:01:44 to put sugar on his Cheerios deranged thing to do in my opinion but i know that but i know that some
03:01:49 people do it um but apparently he he saw my like gummy ingredients on the on the shelf and he thought
03:01:56 he was putting sugar on his Cheerios but he had actually uh picked up my citric acid and he and
03:02:03 he sprinkled pure citric acid onto his Cheerios and ate them uh and i sour Cheerios yeah i imagine it
03:02:11 was not what he hoped it would be uh that sucks as well because sour milk is spoiled oh that must
03:02:20 have been sour that must have been discussed oh yeah it must have curdled the milk probably
03:02:24 maybe well it would it would make you think it's sour like spoiled yeah because of the sourness
03:02:30 must must have been gross um what was shit what was they even what was they talking about um
03:02:37 sugar oh favorite fruit yeah that's my answer passion fruit or grapefruit grapefruit is
03:02:43 whatever i answered already okay i like uh blueberries as well those i've been putting
03:02:49 blueberries in my um in my my oats my overnight oats uh and they're okay i kind of have the same
03:02:58 problem as raspberries i sort of don't like i wouldn't just like eat them i wouldn't just like eat them
03:03:03 straight yeah yeah um i don't think i eat any fruit straight because i'm gay a great
03:03:16 a grapefruit i'll just eat raw okay people the like normal way to eat a grapefruit is you cut it
03:03:23 in half and then you scoop out the sections with a spoon and that's fine and whatever i just like
03:03:28 tear it open and like pull the sections apart with my hands and just eat them like that like an orange
03:03:36 what's one of the sections yes yes except they have a okay an orange you you sort of the sections
03:03:41 sort of come apart because they have that like membrane in between you know what i mean yeah
03:03:47 and you eat it you eat it with the membrane a grapefruit has like the membrane is like thicker
03:03:53 but also it sort of separates more easily so you actually kind of i like pull open the membrane
03:03:59 and like ins and then i kind of scoop the like the pulp out as like a as like a section i pull your
03:04:05 hand i pull it out of the memory i mean yeah it comes apart if you if you pull it apart um
03:04:11 yeah i pull i pull this i pull the fruit out of the membrane and i eat that and then i just kind of
03:04:17 tear it apart into pieces and it's great and it's delicious uh the next voicemail is called Gibb's name
03:04:28 three two one go hey Gibb uh feel free to refuse an answer of course but what the what's your family
03:04:36 call you what's your at-home name uh they call me my birth name still because i haven't changed it
03:04:44 but i ain't i ain't telling you that i ain't giving that out for free i mean i know what it is
03:04:51 yeah so i mean it's been out there okay um
03:04:57 all right uh that's what that's what i thought um yeah i have been dabbling i have been dabbling
03:05:04 though with like with using Amy as a name hmm i don't know whether i truly want to commit to
03:05:11 using that so i've been using it as like when i play a video game and it says what's your name i put
03:05:16 that in hmm well i mean at the moment that's my video game name okay uh i mean um yeah i mean i
03:05:27 i just call you gibb anyway so like uh yeah on the internet yeah gibb is fine and dandy yeah
03:05:35 all righty uh next one is called moo three two one go do you think it's theoretically possible
03:05:43 for an ai to perfectly imitate a human yeah sure whatever yeah i mean give it enough time i mean
03:05:51 you can have an ai create an image that does look like it was drawn by a human like it like you can
03:05:58 do it it does it can't do it all the time oh they didn't say drawing an image they just said
03:06:04 completely replicate a human like oh just like just the way humans do things it's called there's a
03:06:11 video game you should play it's called mega man x that asks this very same question um
03:06:19 because the artificial intelligence really that's smart i mean theoretically yeah because like
03:06:27 i mean if a human brain exists therefore it would be theoretically possible to construct
03:06:35 one that would do the same thing right yeah the only way you could hypothetically get there is not
03:06:43 by micromanaging everything about the brain but it's creating a machine that can learn which is
03:06:49 what ai generally is and so yeah given enough time yeah i think it might make sentient robot people
03:06:57 it might not be possible to do with like computer hardware as it exists like like it might not be
03:07:05 possible to do with like transistors the way that like a computer is is constructed um like you would
03:07:12 need to like like some sort of nanotechnology needs to be invented yeah you would it might be that like
03:07:18 just the the the technological substrate that a computer is built of just like can't uh like
03:07:25 functionally replicate like what a human brain does at like the microscopic level so yeah that
03:07:31 it might need to be a different method uh or or like silicon based yeah or like quantum computer
03:07:41 run with like a superconducting material or something like that or rubber bands inside
03:07:48 so i would say theoretically yes but that doesn't really mean much in terms of like
03:07:54 will will we do it um next one is called happy new year three two one go hey i'm the man who had
03:08:06 gay sex i told you guys about it and uh i had no gay sex and it only gets better that's crazy
03:08:13 dude i love you guys and i love everyone and i hope you guys have a great 2020 being this
03:08:21 distinct and give it it goes it goes it goes it goes it goes yeah i couldn't make out some of that
03:08:29 no they're having a good time that's good that's nice okay yeah true uh next one is called ben's
03:08:37 periodic reminder to look in the mirror and call himself at a handsome devil calm uh okay uh have
03:08:46 you ever done that nope ah you got to get on that that's part of your list of things yeah all right
03:08:53 i'll put it on my put it on my whiteboard uh next one is an image it's an image it's peter parker
03:09:03 uh people who defend human art with an ai ai art people who enjoy speed runs people who
03:09:12 enjoy tasks for some reason the first two constantly fight each other well well a task
03:09:18 is made by a human i don't i don't really see the connection between these two things the first
03:09:25 two constantly fight yeah they're not really equitable a task is still like an impressive
03:09:30 feat for someone to to derive i mean uh like a strategy for how to do it and then seeing it
03:09:37 play out it's just like pressing play on like a video like it it it's not like um like if you
03:09:44 record your drawing and then you play back the recording that's not ai yeah a speed draw like a
03:09:51 human when you see a program running do you think oh a human didn't make this program like a computer
03:09:58 is running it a human a human didn't write it because a computer is running it like that's
03:10:03 what a task is a human wrote the instructions the computer is just executing them so this is a stupid
03:10:10 stupid example um next one is okay well there's a an image and a minute 30 long voicemail so let's
03:10:20 look at the image first does mid journeys license allow for commercial use of imagery generated by
03:10:27 the platform yes but if you're working for a bigger company than a million dollars in annual
03:10:33 revenue we ask that you buy a corporate license did you see consent from living artists or work
03:10:38 still under copyright no there isn't really a way to get 100 million images and know where
03:10:43 they're coming from it would be cool if images of metadata embedding them a copyright owner
03:10:46 something but that's not a thing there's not a registry there's no way to find a picture on the
03:10:49 internet then automatically trace it to an owner and then have anyway okay so this is just mid-journey
03:10:54 admitting that like no we don't have any method in place to prevent the use of
03:11:02 like someone else's intellectual property in order to generate the images we make cool
03:11:07 at least they're honest about it this this this pretty much renders anything that it makes like
03:11:14 suspect okay okay what's the audio then yeah uh three two one go
03:11:24 hey uh just checking in once more about the like AI art uh debate thing uh just because
03:11:32 ben mentioned something like he um assumed quite reasonably honestly that creators of art making
03:11:42 quote unquote AI would always insist basically that their models were ethically sourced
03:11:50 I did not I did not I did not assume that they would insist on that are like in the in public
03:11:55 domain or like whatever right like that are fair to use even for monetary gain or something
03:12:03 I would insist on that but in fact for commercial purposes and I'll link the tweet but there is an
03:12:09 actual interview with David Holtz the creator of mid-journey or the founder who just says like
03:12:16 well we know we literally don't know like yeah where we're getting our fucking images from he
03:12:23 just says like no there is really not a way to get a hundred million images and know where they're
03:12:28 coming from so like he's he's literally admitting to theft practically speaking like and the funniest
03:12:36 these same model makers too they have a very different approach to like AI for making music
03:12:43 because the laws are more stringent and more like actively pursued so they're afraid of
03:12:49 getting sued for that one but not for art because artists are like weaker yeah yeah
03:12:56 yeah all right what if you put like like you couldn't easily get like stock photos without
03:13:05 paying for a license to remove the thing um and stock photo companies they make a lot of that
03:13:13 and they're very they're sensible about protecting it as much as they can they probably don't put
03:13:19 that in the mid-journey thing they just go for whatever is as easiest to get so just things
03:13:23 are online i mean yeah i have apps i have no idea what like what method mid-journey uses to like
03:13:31 accumulate it's it's a image library it could be as simple as google image search that's that's
03:13:38 like my naive assumption is that like do you just google image search and it puts stuff together uh
03:13:46 maybe i just i just don't know but like yeah i definitely did not assume that AI generators
03:13:57 creators or people that use it would insist on that i that's what i said that would be my criteria
03:14:04 for like is this is this good actually at least like in terms of like commercial use
03:14:10 like with like without that assurance it's it's like it's a it's a hard no and like okay i just
03:14:16 yeah we definitely don't have that assurance maybe i don't know maybe there are other ones that do
03:14:20 a more um a more ethical job of it uh just to be clear though like for non-commercial purposes
03:14:29 i kind of think anything's fair game like fuck it steal other people's art and mash them up
03:14:35 if you're if like as long as you're not like selling it like who cares
03:14:39 yep um okay next one is just one more at gmail.law so a picture of a guy
03:14:49 let's see let's see this guy just looks like a guy
03:14:54 there he is okay i'll play the voicemail three two one go
03:14:58 no also i'm sorry but like i just looked at um the Forbes article that this excerpt comes from
03:15:08 and it has a picture in it of what mr. Holtz looks like and i gotta say i was expecting a
03:15:18 little bit more of a brad garling house looking type but instead first of all he looks like a
03:15:24 fucking hobbit he looks he looks like he's about to go oh oh mr. Frodo
03:15:33 mr. Frodo i have a beautiful new image it looks very creepy
03:15:41 it looks it looks very odd a machine created it oh my god and also am i crazy does this his
03:15:49 fucking face look ai generated it's fucking weird i mean i know we're like Mark Zuckerberg
03:15:55 unreal like artificial human vibes jesus christ i think he looks what a fucking goon i think he
03:16:01 looks pretty normal i think he looks pretty normal i i assumed when you posted the image that this was
03:16:07 like an ai generated face or something and i was looking for things and i think his his right eye or
03:16:14 his left eye that's looking a little sus but then it's a photo of a person so i don't think it
03:16:21 i think people are just asymmetrical sometimes yeah i think it's just a shadow or something
03:16:26 no you know i found that i'm asymmetrical in a way that i wasn't real i didn't realize before
03:16:32 it fucked me up i looked in the mirror i was like wait what's wrong with my face what's wrong
03:16:37 with my eyes i look like this oh my god i'm i'm definitely a little asymmetrical in like a little
03:16:46 bit in like my jaw in my my ear my my like hairline uh it's like a little bit yeah i'm
03:16:54 i'm asymmetrical in a bunch of different my my glasses actually kind of rest like a little
03:16:58 bit crooked because like my ears are a little asymmetrical i'm fucked up i'm fucked up that
03:17:05 also you know what else is fucking me up is uh still discord is not is not showing me like a
03:17:11 properly timed green circle it like still is not capable of of like just displaying when the sound
03:17:19 is being produced like it's it's been it's been like three hours now what the what and i'm and
03:17:25 i'm getting angry about it all over again just don't worry about it right now discord after this
03:17:32 okay next next one is uh okay it's another one wait did i just download that one we just listened
03:17:41 to no but i will okay the next one is unrelated from prince isolation okay three two one go
03:17:49 completely unrelated um i just wanted to clear up one small thing about um tom the tin can man
03:17:57 uh i don't know if i brought it across completely accurately in the voicemail that i was talking
03:18:05 about him but i just want to make clear that i like him in fact i love him and i want him to keep
03:18:13 calling into the pcp just to make sure tom mr tin can man whatever your name is i love you
03:18:21 and genuinely keep calling into the pcp we got great in fact get a tinnier microphone please
03:18:29 get him get a tinnier one the smoke more weed before you call in well please already okay
03:18:37 we already had him ask us so what our favorite fruit is so you know wish granted
03:18:43 uh next one is called by definition three two one go
03:18:47 uh there he is so the man himself older movies classics that i needed to watch and
03:18:58 basically is jesse literally bitter juice no jesse literally bitter juice what are you what
03:19:07 am i supposed to say that the answer is no okay if you say his name jesse jesse jesse
03:19:13 uh something happens something something happens okay next one is from mage of light
03:19:20 regard okay it's in two parts regarding ai art part one okay three two one go
03:19:27 so regarding the ai art thing i think it's i i said this on the bank court
03:19:34 or like a lot of time ago i think it's interesting to like you said to see what what it can do like
03:19:44 the machine learning i think it's the name of it yeah like to put words and see what it speeds out
03:19:52 like how does it think how does it connect concepts or shit like that i think that's
03:20:00 that's funny that's interesting but also like the problem with with it is that i have yet to see
03:20:07 a single ai art app that is not monetizing some way like they always heard like buy premium and
03:20:19 do more things or shit like that and it's like that is the fucking problem if it was just free
03:20:24 for everyone it would be like okay you know what do whatever the fuck you want you can already do it
03:20:29 it would take you a lot of time you know image editing and all that but whatever you know it's
03:20:35 the internet you know that it's like that but the problem is that it is just why why do they have to
03:20:45 charge for it it's the problem that's the that's the main problem to me like that shouldn't be like
03:20:51 yeah like that
03:20:55 i mean it's a guy with headphones who looks like a hobbit who's like oh what if i do this then i
03:21:01 can make money i mean i can i can pay for my my um uh what do i have apartment uh the fact the fact
03:21:16 that um the fact that he the guys made a program and he's charging for use of the program is not
03:21:25 really like the problematic part of it because like that's normal when you i mean i don't like if
03:21:33 it's like subscription based but like that's a separate problem if he had the program and he had
03:21:37 a website and you could go to the website and generate something for free but maybe he gets
03:21:43 paid through traffic like is that better i mean yeah i mean yeah yeah it's better it's better
03:21:56 but i don't i don't begrudge someone for monetizing their work
03:22:03 quote unquote there well well yeah i mean they made the program i know i know but that's the whole
03:22:10 problem is that the the the resource is mining is the problem with the work is that what it produces
03:22:17 is a a theft machine uh he built this machine and that's cool but like what the machine does
03:22:25 it's what the machine does that is like the the the ai problem not that like he's selling the machine
03:22:33 you know yeah i guess i guess if if it was free if it was a free thing that you could
03:22:39 generate an image based off of stolen work you could still then use that image to make your own
03:22:44 money so it would not solve the problem of art being taken without consent yeah it's it's i yeah i
03:22:53 think it you you said it you said it um there was um well okay let's listen to part two because
03:23:00 there's two parts of this one uh three two one go also if you think that you can just input something
03:23:07 into an a art machine and then that is you doing something other than just stealing shit i want
03:23:15 you to know that you are worse than fucking mary weather who actually pays people for the work
03:23:21 or even fucking more logic the wonderbread guy you're worse than them okay okay uh there's um
03:23:29 all right there was a thread going around on twitter the other day of it showed these like
03:23:35 shoes that were uh they were these like baroque sort of like like like oh yeah i saw those they
03:23:43 look so cool they looked really cool i'm trying to find them i can't find the they're in my likes
03:23:51 yeah if you could find those for me i would appreciate it because i'm i'm coming up blank
03:23:57 on a search um and yeah someone pointed out that they were they were ai generated they are they were
03:24:04 nice looking designs there they are there they are nike ex balman rikoko i mean beautiful who's
03:24:10 balmain i have no idea is that the name of the guy who's saying i invented this by typing it into the
03:24:17 ai generator is it like some other thing because i assumed i assumed it was like oh a fancy designer
03:24:24 had a collaboration with nike products to make yeah a series of like extremely expensive
03:24:30 designer shoes that are you know fashionable like that time xbox made a gucci like combo thing
03:24:39 there was like gucci and xbox made a gucci xbox controller or something with a weird like lavish
03:24:47 like controller case it's like that sort of thing these are pretty gorgeous shoes i just um
03:24:58 i think you know i think a human could have come up with this i i guess it's nice that
03:25:04 like the computer did such a good job you know putting the pieces together to design these
03:25:09 shoes like i guess that's something that it did pretty well but i think a human could have come
03:25:15 up with these ideas i guess maybe it's saved on like design work but like i mean the fact that
03:25:22 somebody a human came up with the prompts implies that you could come up with this right right yeah
03:25:30 true and and also just like you know these images are fine but they're just images like if someone
03:25:36 if someone wanted to make these shoes like you would still have to make them uh like i said i
03:25:42 don't i don't have any problem with someone using an ai to mash images together and in the and maybe
03:25:50 if it comes up with something if it puts things together that like looks cool like use that
03:25:56 like it's a it's a cool idea but you would you would then have to actually make these shoes
03:26:02 and like you know because these shoes don't exist and an an AI can't do that and i think that he i
03:26:07 think that a human could have uh could have conceptualized them i guess i guess it would
03:26:14 have been very work intensive to like produce images like this of a theoretical shoe with these
03:26:22 designs yeah i want i wonder how much like work had to go into like refining refining the prompts
03:26:32 and stuff and training the ai in a particular way to get it to produce such uh such high quality
03:26:40 you know renders i want to buy them somebody should somebody should just take the designs
03:26:47 steal them from the ai because you know i don't want to buy them because i know these are going
03:26:51 to cost like nine hundred dollars yeah but then somebody should make them and then i should be
03:26:57 like ah cool i wish i could have that uh i can't i'm glad somebody else will buy those so that i
03:27:03 don't have to yeah the the the creation of such a thing the the world happiness gone up perhaps
03:27:12 what's the bike thing perhaps yeah the shen uh the total happiness in the world increase total
03:27:19 happiness the world increased but like not in a stupid way um i don't know why i brought these
03:27:26 i think just mage of light mentioned like it's interesting to see like what the computer comes
03:27:31 up with and like yeah here's an example yeah i mean i wouldn't say that it's ai generation is
03:27:39 like inherently gross it's just the practice around it yeah yeah the the practice the practice
03:27:44 are okay in in particular what's really irksome is when i see someone saying like i'm an artist
03:27:49 because i put the right prompts in like that that pisses me off no you're not the computer
03:27:55 the computer the program made this image you you merely stumbled upon maybe you had to iterate
03:28:02 but like i don't i don't care like that's not it's not art to like refine a series of image
03:28:08 searches to produce a result that you're happy with like i mean no matter what if you do a prompt in
03:28:16 these things and you get a series of images and you don't like any of them you can use the exact
03:28:22 same prompt and do it again and get different images so it's not like the prompt is exactly
03:28:28 tied to whatever image ends up so it's like you have less creative control than you even you think
03:28:35 you do there's like there's a guy who made like a children's book uh oh the soulless man with no
03:28:43 soul i don't know maybe i think that well maybe i saw there was a guy who's just like ai generated
03:28:51 an entire book and tried to sell it as his own work and he looked like the sort of person who
03:28:55 has never thought anything nice in his whole life i don't know if it's the same guy but there was a
03:29:02 guy who made an ai generated children's book and okay even though i think that was the book was
03:29:08 probably bad i do think that i do think that it is art in the sense that like the the images are
03:29:17 not like he is not an artist he did not produce the images the computer produced the images
03:29:21 but he did select them and curate them and put them together into a book and i do think that is
03:29:28 art i don't think it's necessarily good but i do think curation and like selecting and like
03:29:33 putting things together into a into a coherent work is art of a sort so i do think that like a
03:29:41 book made of images that were ai generated is art just like i think you know harry partridge
03:29:47 said that he used ai to like generate some backgrounds for an animation and like the
03:29:53 animation that he made using those ai generated images is still art the the background itself
03:29:58 is not really because the computer made it well the only difference would be is that he
03:30:03 doesn't ai generate the entirety of the animation just an aspect of it with this children's book
03:30:08 it's an entire like did he animate did he ai generate the story as well i don't disagree with
03:30:14 the curation i don't i don't know i think i yeah no i think ai might have been used in like in
03:30:21 writing i think i think he said that like yeah ai wrote the text as well it's it's kind of like
03:30:29 a collage if you if you take a bunch of artist work and you cut out bits that you like and stick
03:30:34 them together um you've made a collage uh using yeah other people's work yeah so it's creative in
03:30:42 that sense but like yes you didn't really the individual pieces no i i i i i i i i i i i i i
03:30:52 i'll put my foot down a hard line stance is that like if a computer if a computer generates the
03:30:57 image if you you are not the artist you you might do something with it you might curate it you might
03:31:03 arrange it you might edit it into something and then you could maybe say that you have some ownership
03:31:07 over that thing uh yeah um okay next one is a dream i had last night three two one go
03:31:19 hey ben saint and uh i assume there's other people on the podcast this week true i had a dream last
03:31:27 and you were in it so i thought i would tell you so i was in the jungle right because i was on
03:31:33 vacation on this tropical island and i had already gotten a pretty good tan the other day but there
03:31:39 was a monkey in the house but that's not important we were in the jungle and um there was this big
03:31:46 snake and you spotted it slithering in the grass and it had like cat ears like it was like a cat
03:31:52 snake and you were like see the trick to this is and then you like went to try to grab it
03:31:57 and you grabbed it and then it like went around and bit you and um yeah it seems like something
03:32:04 you would do fucking idiot i'm sorry god yeah you see the the trick with these cat snakes is
03:32:13 ah stabbed yeah i can see it
03:32:20 i like the idea of a cat ear snake it's like i can't even even like mistakes that i didn't
03:32:28 even actually make it's like nah ben would do that so let's hold him let's hold him accountable
03:32:35 man there's just no winning yeah the trick to this cat snake i think i would avoid such a creature
03:32:43 it wasn't true but the fact that i thought it could be says a lot about society there's a lot
03:32:48 about society there's a lot about the podcast there's a lot about the state of the podcast
03:32:53 uh next one is an image let's see what do we got it's a cartoon honey could you get the meat out
03:33:01 of the fridge while i'm chopping these potatoes sure thing dear hmm but who is the cuck and who is the
03:33:09 in this scenario yeah yeah it it did seem a little funny i like the idea of a cooking person
03:33:21 that i'm watching two people cooking and i'm thinking like one of these people is getting
03:33:25 played like one of these people one of these people is the winner and one of these people is the loser
03:33:32 the scenario cooking is nice i like the smell maybe feels good sometimes to get some good food made
03:33:41 i'm not i'm not gonna disagree i i think it it's true that it says more about me than it says about
03:33:47 anything else that i saw a couple like cooking and i thought and my assumption is like this guy is
03:33:53 just doing this to impress that girl this guy is just doing this to like yeah as like a a move
03:34:01 okay uh i mean even if that was the the reason like ultimately it's like what's the problem
03:34:10 i i guess i well i'm gonna learn how to cook in order to make myself okay or more attractive
03:34:16 when i would shake my head and i would say no i should be unattractive yeah he yeah he made yeah
03:34:21 he made a delicious meal but like did it did it cost him his soul did it cost him his soul
03:34:27 no no um lamal all right next one i like this i like this one this one's really funny um i should
03:34:41 honestly i should tweet this this is about me i feel like this represents me honestly the next
03:34:48 one is called five skin head three two one go ben you should absolutely give a shit about your
03:34:56 foreskin this thing is super important let me tell you as a kid i was the only peeled person
03:35:03 in my whole family and whenever we would like pee i'd look over what and see that their penises
03:35:10 look different than mine why i feel left out why would you all pee together my mind looks so weird
03:35:14 compared to them you know yeah i mean we feel bad definitely but also that's rough having this
03:35:20 foreskin is just better for sexual acts from like masturbation how would you know to insertion
03:35:26 and everything in between like there's no benefit to circumcision aside from the fact
03:35:34 that it's marginally easier to paint to clean your penis but you know that's such a minor benefit
03:35:42 compared to everything else how do you know and also it is maybe there seems to be possible
03:35:48 to regrow your foreskin oh my god you just have to like train it with tools or whatever what the
03:35:54 fuck pen and tell our bullshit episode about it it's pretty disgusting what and i'm too much of
03:36:01 a pussy to do it no but uh no it's totally possible do your research shut up shut up man
03:36:06 this guy's fucking with me this guy's fucking with me by delivering this completely insane
03:36:12 you can grow it back Ben information you're just gonna dead he sounds he sounds like he
03:36:16 believes it he sounds like he really believes it and it's messing with me okay you just gotta
03:36:22 you gotta get your inner like chameleon your inner lizard to grow that skin back
03:36:29 okay there is there is a pen and teller bullshit episode about circumcision maybe i'll watch it
03:36:37 sometime okay okay um next one is uh image do you think that guy's sincere or is he or is he
03:36:50 joking i mean i don't know maybe he feels very sad about not having a foreskin but he can't
03:36:58 actually think maybe he's hoping that you can regrow your foreskin by training it with tools
03:37:04 right like that's a completely deranged thing to say what kind of tools okay so like a vice
03:37:14 grip like pulling on it like what the hell i i train it with tools get the fuck out of here um

03:40:11 it was balanced and i forgot to flip it back so the progression may seem backwards but whatever
03:40:17 yo gib i annoyed ben in the time i haven't been able to draw so this is more of an apology for
03:40:26 this week why are you saying me yeah what yeah he viny did annoy me because he was like posting
03:40:34 like way too many memes in my in my server oh right he would do this thing where he would just be like
03:40:41 he would find like a completely random image and he would just post it and be like this is just like
03:40:45 when ben does x or this is when ben does y and it would be like just some random shit and i was
03:40:51 viny what are you talking about why do you pose this picture of like a cat and it's like ha ha
03:40:57 this is just like when ben sees a girl and is in and embarrasses himself so yeah okay i think
03:41:03 that's what he's talking about um i really like this meteor yeah i like the teeth they're very like
03:41:11 yeah these are cool i feel like i feel like viny uh this i'm this is the this is like
03:41:23 the best viny art in terms of like art i don't know yeah good good teeth
03:41:29 i see he's using the tablet nice drawing digitally yeah the good good use of color
03:41:34 yeah the the bright teeth on the black meteor that looks awesome genuinely looks really cool
03:41:41 so it's like a cycle natural ben saint to cop killer to murder meteor oh the little arrows natural
03:41:48 ben saint oh i see i see this is your evolution this is your pokemon evolution yeah the apotheosis
03:41:59 of dark ben becomes murder meteor cop killington okay i'm just i'm just looking i'm just i'm just
03:42:08 admiring my teeth that is what my teeth look like i gotta go to the dentist the bright green and
03:42:14 glowing bright green and glowing um one of these days one of these days uh maybe after i finish the
03:42:25 book i gotta finish the book so i can maybe that's why i haven't finished the book because i know that
03:42:30 after i finish the book i gotta go to the dentist you can do with a dentist at any time wrong you
03:42:37 can say to the dentist please make a appointment and they say okay uh you would think so you would
03:42:45 think so but uh it's just not it's just not how it works unfortunately it's more complicated
03:42:51 they want to see the book first you wouldn't understand yeah they said don't they said
03:42:56 ben saint why are you don't even show your face around don't call that book don't call us again
03:43:01 until until the book is out you're not allowed to have teeth
03:43:09 what a thing to say to someone you're not allowed to have teeth you will not we will not serve you
03:43:16 you do not deserve this form of medical care uh oh that's the last voicemail
03:43:23 um we did it yeah yeah
03:43:30 hooray um
03:43:36 well that's the end that is the end um any final do you have any final
03:43:42 shit to say uh well ben's gonna be streaming we're gonna be streaming at some some time this week
03:43:50 i will do well by the time this episode is out i will have already done at least one stream
03:43:54 to i might also yeah i might also do a few streams i've been thinking about it i just
03:44:01 like art stress i don't know about art streams maybe art streams that's the thing i can't decide
03:44:06 whether i want to play video games or draw because like drawing would be would be saving on like a
03:44:15 time i could be doing two things at once but i don't know kind of true kind of true
03:44:22 uh i mean since yeah i'm gonna do gaming because my plan is to play those games on
03:44:28 just kind of the whole point so yeah i don't know i never really i always found drawing on stream
03:44:36 very distracting i always found chat like really distracting from like me trying to actually do
03:44:42 the work you know yeah i guess my streams were quite quiet because i stood them at like weird
03:44:52 hours and for a long time so people would jump in and then leave yeah when i did those well i mean
03:44:58 it's like if the if there's if the chat is not active then it's like why am i even streaming this
03:45:04 but if the chat is active then it's like it's distracting me from drawing i guess i guess that
03:45:10 i i think i think i managed to do more work just because it's easier to work with an audience
03:45:17 it is it kind of like then it is like it like the distractions are outweighed by
03:45:23 the compulsion to not fuck around yeah it's like because people are people are watching you don't
03:45:28 want to like seem like you're just wasting time yeah yeah i i understand that oh you know what i
03:45:37 could do yeah my dark cloud video i could play dark cloud on stream oh i could use that footage
03:45:45 for the video that could be fun oh you mean the one oh i didn't realize you were actually working on
03:45:52 that well the prerequisite is that i need to play the games all the way through and then yeah
03:45:59 tabs on like various things because not everything is in the wiki and so i need to i need to delve
03:46:06 deep and find all the text boxes and stuff and if i have like i play a 100 play through of both of
03:46:12 them then i'll have all the footage i'll see everything i mean i don't know how it'll go
03:46:17 but like yeah when i eventually make the battle network lecture uh i might yeah i could definitely
03:46:25 see myself using some like clips of me streaming it if i have like any like reactions to any like
03:46:32 really bizarre stuff in there like i might use some footage from the streams to like highlight
03:46:38 some shit uh definitely that's the cool you know you gotta do you do you do work you spend your
03:46:46 time doing things that all feed into each other it all it's all part of the it's all part of the
03:46:50 workflow funnel you funnel it all into content you gotta make content yeah yeah oh i love content
03:46:59 i do love content i'm i'm such a little piggy i just want to roll around in my content slop
03:47:08 yeah true it's want to roll and i'm tired of pretending that i care about quality
03:47:14 i'm just want to eat my little content i always want to eat my my content from my content trough
03:47:23 i just want to go up to that trough and just stick my face in there and just slurp up all the
03:47:26 content this just comes down the pipe oh i'm just i'm just a plant in a big crop circle
03:47:35 waiting for the big bar to rotate over me and drip some content on me so i can grow
03:47:43 uh yeah all the plants in the world they see water's content
03:47:46 consume to be yeah to you know if you're a plant imagine you're a plant well to you water would
03:47:56 be like a new red letter media video like you need it to live and if you don't get it you'll
03:48:02 wither and die um oh did you see this did you see uh the news reporting about the new key video
03:48:12 do you know they're they did the one where they finally watch new key yeah i saw a twitter video
03:48:17 of like somebody recording the news where it's like talking about the new key tape
03:48:24 and yeah it's it's got a lot of money oh yeah but okay but what i'm talking about is like there was
03:48:32 at least one news outlet that reported on it and they pretty much like chain they reported it like
03:48:38 like it was a scam like as though red letter media were like scamming people
03:48:43 oh i didn't see that i saw like they said it was going to charity and it was all fine that's an
03:48:47 interesting story moving on the one i saw was like oh youtubers like destroy youtubers destroy
03:48:54 like copies of like a rare vhs tape in order to drive up the price of like their one copy
03:49:01 and it's like god like the video is literally like a parody of that it's literally like a like a
03:49:06 commentary on that like people do that and it's bad and uh yeah fucking but they just reported on
03:49:15 it as though it were being done just like sincerely uh very frustrating i don't feel bad i don't feel
03:49:22 bad for red letter media because like they're fine but it is but it is annoying to see uh the facts
03:49:29 mis misrepresented in such a way you understand it's a soda yeah i mean it's this with regards to
03:49:37 red letter media especially there's no chance of that like false narrative sticking anywhere no
03:49:46 because some some old person who's like i've never heard of this new key before
03:49:52 i thought you were gonna say i've never heard of red letter media before but they probably
03:49:56 knew either yeah yeah yeah yeah um right it's like uh damn uh you know just uh i saw j j was
03:50:08 tweeting about that like this was the way that this particular outlet chose to report on it
03:50:16 it reminded me of reminded me of taylor lorenz reporting on the um the freaking chili neighbor
03:50:22 situation choosing to both sides the chili neighbor thing
03:50:28 oh no yeah yeah no not the chili thing yes the chili thing it will never go away
03:50:37 it will never leave the discourse it'll never leave my personal discourse it dealt me irreparable
03:50:41 psychic damage imagine both sides in somebody giving chili to someone else yeah hmm a person gave
03:50:56 their neighbor chili and some other people got really angry at them about it but like we need
03:51:01 to like like we we gotta like let's hear both sides of the issue let's hear both sides maybe they
03:51:06 got a point maybe they got a point because why else would they be mad there must be there must
03:51:12 be a problem wasn't like there was a kitten punching tweet or whatever but we could but we
03:51:22 could do we could be we could start that discourse oh like punch a kitten yeah and then when the news
03:51:30 reports on it and then when the news reports in it like podcasters punch kitten and tweet about it
03:51:38 and then we retweet the article we roll our eyes when we say uh these guys don't understand we were
03:51:42 doing it as commentary on other people that punch kittens we were doing it ironically to show how
03:51:47 bad it is oh yeah that's why i just don't get it we're being persecuted by the liberal media
03:51:53 mm-hmm
