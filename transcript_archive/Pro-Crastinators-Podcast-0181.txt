00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:10 the best guy ever and today we are joined by the likes of Digibro- oh wait no I'm not
00:00:15 him Bob. I was about to turn the podcast off but now it's okay. We can keep with him. Saved
00:00:21 in the nick of time. We've got Ben Saint, there he is. Yeah, hey what was that really funny
00:00:25 joke I made before the show started and I said hey I'm gonna say that on the show. Don't
00:00:30 tell anyone that I said it before. Anyone remember? No. It was a punchline of a joke
00:00:39 I think so. It was something about on my podcast what are you doing in my podcast. Oh yeah
00:00:44 with the steamed hams. Oh oh oh yes yes okay introduce someone else. Gibbontake is here.
00:00:54 Hello. Gibbontake in this part of this part at this time of day in this part of the country
00:01:01 located entirely within our podcast. You did it. Yes. What's the joke? You know steamed
00:01:11 hams. Steamed hams reference. It's just a reference the lowest form of comedy. No no
00:01:16 it subverts the original. Ben you have to say may I see him. You have to say may I see
00:01:22 him. Oh may I see him. No. Then I disconnect from the call and I leave. Someone else had
00:01:31 to say may I see him. You may have noticed mage is there. Hey I am here I am excited
00:01:37 I want to talk about anime, yes and other things. Oh that's a big oof from the audience.
00:01:44 You can leave, you can all leave. And of course Tom Oliver is here. MLP died yesterday and
00:01:50 I'm not emotionally bothered by it. Was it the finale? It was the finale, it was yesterday.
00:01:56 But it continues in the comics as I understand. The journey never ends. Yeah whatever. Did the
00:02:02 thing I watched be like a leaked finale then? Yeah that was leaked a while ago. I watched
00:02:08 the finale a while ago and I thought it was stupid but whatever. Stupid. You know I don't know
00:02:13 anything about these new characters but I do want to watch the final episode because I have a
00:02:19 feeling I will enjoy it. I'll get some chills. I got a thought on the finale of MLP and it's
00:02:25 I think I may have said this somewhere else but the finale of MLP it sort of goes against the
00:02:34 whole message of the show at the final moment when you think it wouldn't because you know they've
00:02:40 been like redeeming villains and that's been cool. In the last season three of the previously
00:02:45 defeated villains Chrysalis, King Sombra and Cozy Glow from season seven. Who the fuck is Cozy
00:02:51 Glow? She's a little Philly Pegasus. She's a Philly Pegasus pony who tries to take over the
00:03:02 school and thus the world. With her toxic femininity. Wait what? The school? Is this from
00:03:07 Equestria Girls? No they're the school. They make a school of friendship in season seven and she's
00:03:12 the villain of that. Anyway they come back right? Season eight they come back. They're gathered
00:03:18 together and they have to work together. There's a number of episodes where they work together,
00:03:24 learn to you know care about each other a little bit just so that they can get further in their
00:03:29 goal to destroy the main six and kill Twilight. And you think what's happening is that they're
00:03:35 gonna go they become super powerful. The season ender Tupada is like ridiculously over the top
00:03:42 way like super big you know Dragon Ball Z but like even more. Okay. Was it like like the
00:03:50 Tyric fight? Yeah Tyric but like a million times. Too damn. Imagine it's an army of Tyric showdown.
00:03:57 Like if you if you're into that it is very cool but yeah it was alright but like it's it's all
00:04:04 this stuff it's leading up you know these villains are learning the power of friendship to combat
00:04:10 the Princess of Friendship. Yeah it's a real force. You would think that by the end having learned
00:04:15 friendship they'd realize they'd have some sort of redemption moment where it's like oh right
00:04:20 right being a friendship is good and friendships and maybe I could be friends with more than
00:04:25 just the obvious place to go. Yeah instead they just kill them and they turn them into stone.
00:04:29 Princess Twilight and all her friends all of the friends she's made on her part of the season
00:04:36 come together and they do a gigantic beam blast like like exactly how they go to Discord except
00:04:44 Discord participates in this one and they Celestia Luna all the Alicorns all the ponies all the
00:04:51 characters every single person in the world like Lenby our energy this is the Goku moment this is
00:04:55 the you know the spirit bomb she just turns them to stone that's it no redemption kill them is the
00:05:01 end and that's the end of the show. If there's any kind of people that can't be redeemed there's of
00:05:07 course you know literally Hitler, Sombra and those goddamn turfs Chrysalis and Cosy Glow like a child
00:05:16 yeah this is why it's so strange. Straight off murder she's just she'll be back in the future when
00:05:24 they've got a way to fucking you know fix your mind yeah sure it feels like it feels like it's
00:05:30 leaving it open for them to be back but it's just sort of like I mean Sombra comes back at the
00:05:35 beginning but he immediately enough in the two putter in the beginning he decides to not work
00:05:39 with the others he goes out on his own and he gets not like blown apart like last time but like
00:05:44 literally disintegrated you see a skull in the like a few frames whoa wait wait wait you're
00:05:50 saying in the final episode in the in the in the in the opening episode of season 8 Sombra
00:05:55 comes back with all the four villains but he says no I don't care season 9 whatever he comes back
00:06:02 and he's like I don't need friendship to defeat the main six and he goes to do that and that's like
00:06:07 the the villain of of the opening and he gets completely killed disintegrated you see a skull
00:06:15 it's really kind of oh you see a skull jeez it's great as his skin gets ripped up in the blinding
00:06:22 flash of light and it's like wow they did that um so it's like it's it's set the president at the
00:06:27 end of brunswick yeah indeed indeed so like it says the president for the villains not being redeemed
00:06:35 but it seems like chrysalis terek and cozy glow they have like funny moments you see more of their
00:06:40 character they're not totally evil they have a song in this season together that they sing and
00:06:46 there's like why do they get blown to well turn to stone so maybe the real maybe the real world
00:06:54 conquest with the friends we made along the way oh wait no they're all turned to stone
00:07:00 you're saying that it's at the beginning of season nine somber doesn't join them and these
00:07:04 over the course of season nine these terek cozy glow and chrysalis they do their little friendship
00:07:09 thing and at the end of season nine they in fact are turned to stone not redeemed and that's the
00:07:13 last place we leave that's it okay gotcha gotcha that's not the finality of season nine though season
00:07:18 nine is just like this like flash forward right yeah at the end of the episode that well here's one
00:07:24 more episode after the two part which is right twilight's old and she's an alicorn and then we
00:07:29 see the rest of the main six come in who are they're all wrinkly and old and they're visibly
00:07:35 they're not they're not like they're not like granny smith they're not granny smith they're
00:07:38 sort of like they're getting up there though they're like they're like uh they're like milfs
00:07:43 they're like milfs in this stage uh applejack wearing granny smith's like fucking scarf
00:07:49 thingy because granny smith is dead fucking dead shit yeah yeah i caught that so yeah and dragon
00:07:56 spike spike looks like the the buff spike that he imagined himself being way back in a dog and
00:08:02 pony show circle of life so it's like spike's gonna live for a thousand years twilight's gonna
00:08:07 live for thousands of years everyone's gonna fucking and everyone else is gonna die and but
00:08:11 you know that's i i i mean i like i like that they went with that instead of like trying to not do
00:08:16 that because i i like when they do endings like this famously the final episode of star trek the
00:08:23 next generation is a two-parter i forget what it's called till we meet again i can't remember um but
00:08:28 it is it is the same kind of flash forward it's actually like it's like a time travel-esque kind
00:08:32 of episode oh my god it's like the best episode two part it ties into the very first episode it
00:08:37 ties into the whole series and the finale oh my god it's so fucking sick friends or my thing of a
00:08:41 different episode i you know i gotta fucking i gotta get the name right but the point is it's it's
00:08:45 it's a great way to end your series right he's like tabs in front they say that i know i don't
00:08:52 think so i think i'm thinking of a different episode isn't that isn't that a reference to doesn't
00:08:56 spock do you like this don't they do the same thing they do that in in the original and it's a
00:09:01 reference they do they do yeah that's okay that's when that's after spock dies kirk does two absent
00:09:07 friends yes yes that that's what that is this is um by the way the episode's all good things it's
00:09:13 all good things dot dot dot and it's uh it's okay i just want to say yeah for the record all good
00:09:19 things dot dot dot come to those who wait uh something like that but listen to this though
00:09:24 they i just this episode is so brilliant okay for example i'm gonna spoil it a little bit
00:09:29 in the episode and things could change it like with the it's a time travel kind of episode a
00:09:33 little bit they have to mix up some timelines and match them up whatever it doesn't matter
00:09:37 fix the time space continue them it was a big deal um in that episode we see that in the future
00:09:43 like picard's back on his vineyard in france um he if you don't know everybody uh star trek
00:09:48 has picard who is has a british accent but canonically he is from france because canonically
00:09:55 france was conquered by england so despite the fact that he is in fact yeah it was about time i'd say
00:10:02 so he is french but you know british too or whatever okay point is we see the flash forward
00:10:06 spock has left starfleet has become like a professor has like sorry i said spock i meant data data best
00:10:12 character of all time data is the greatest character ever conceived by man uh he got some
00:10:17 emotions he got his chip going he's he's grown in so many different ways he's left starfleet to pursue
00:10:22 his new passions because despite what you may think he wasn't programmed to be a starfleet
00:10:26 officer he's an autonomous free being who chose to join starfleet of his own free will because
00:10:31 that's what he is um and in that we see him like as this he's a professor at oxford i believe
00:10:37 and he's doing great he's older but that gets hard retcon in star trek nemesis where data just
00:10:43 fucking dies in the fucking piece of shit movies and it's just blown to fucking smithereens in the
00:10:48 last didn't you like rant this exact rant like like i know i know that's all i have to say about
00:10:54 it it's just the most retarded i'm just saying like the show is perfect very recently the show
00:11:00 ended perfectly so i don't want to what my point is i don't want these cowardly mlp fucks to go back
00:11:06 and start changing continuity oh like different things happen after the end before the flash forward
00:11:11 i mean they're going to i'm sure it was perfect comics they're already doing it it's gonna well
00:11:15 maybe those are before the end of the last episode i don't know whatever it's okay anyway it's
00:11:20 i like star trek that's what i have to say and i like anime and i want to talk about anime okay
00:11:25 go for anime do you want to talk about a lot a lot of several enemies have you have you have you
00:11:31 been guys like looking at the most recent uh new anime seasons a season i don't know i'm sure i'm the
00:11:37 only one who's even potentially doing that but i actually did look a little bit but not much
00:11:42 okay oh which ones have you seen no like none i think i watched like the new
00:11:49 season of uh of demon slayer is like the only one though i am looking for new ones i'm checking
00:11:54 them out okay it's just because i'm so excited about this like season because we i i don't know why
00:12:00 it just feels like it has better better like a lot better shows than last season did or at least i
00:12:05 the ones that i prefer and uh one one one of them is uh we called
00:12:13 and that's the one that has me in it just to remind you right oh i love that screenshot yeah
00:12:19 yeah i just i love this anime like um the first episode i laughed so hard just i was unable to
00:12:26 like communicate to bite her with words so i just started making noises through laughter
00:12:33 he said like what are you saying and i said i can't i can't even words
00:12:38 because it was so fun and then then second episode i just i just laughed till i cried and i don't
00:12:44 remember the last time an anime made me cry laugh i can just imagine you sitting there just sitting
00:12:50 in your own filth just going literally me literally me pointing at the screen maids no that that
00:12:55 no no that character is just a background character she barely spoke i don't know well
00:13:00 that's good it means you can imagine we can project that it really is i don't know like the
00:13:05 fact that i'm in it isn't consequential it's just like the rest of the anime is really good what
00:13:11 what sort of uh comedy is it is it like your typical anime uh bullshit comedy or is it actually
00:13:17 funny of course it is okay yeah it's a little hard to say um it's it's a little bit like
00:13:25 i can't i can't even say how do you describe anime comedy it defies words that's why they
00:13:31 invented a visual auditory medium to express these feelings with known as anime i mean you
00:13:37 could talk about like a specific joke i don't know because it won't be funny when i say it just
00:13:43 just one you gotta give the people a taste so they'll go watch the show they're like more like this
00:13:47 please no no you can't explain jokes no you can't explain you can analyze and explain jokes
00:13:55 you have to be as serious as possible no the only joke on my mind is like the most recent one and
00:13:59 it's like super funny and i don't want to spoil it because it's hilarious and that's the one that made
00:14:04 me cry it makes you cry okay with laughter i assume with joy okay all right i think it'll make me
00:14:11 cry okay but the premise is the premise is it's a very sad premise and it reminds me of another
00:14:16 anime that i never watched it's like okay so there's this boy and he's such a pushover and his parents
00:14:22 just sort of like use him make him work while they they're absolutely dead beats until they
00:14:27 eventually sell his soul to a demon just for some money okay so the poor poor boy sounds like typical
00:14:34 capitalism at right boys that's what yeah so the poor boy is busy like on a fishing boat in the middle
00:14:39 of like a storm or something like that and he's being like crushed by giant fish because of the
00:14:46 storm and like he suddenly whisked away into the demon world and the demon is like hi your parents
00:14:52 sold your soul to me so be my grandson and he wants to say no for once in his life he wants to say no
00:15:00 but then the demon cries and he begs and is like please i don't i don't have children i always wanted
00:15:05 to have grandchildren please my be my grandson and so he agrees reluctantly and he said oh good
00:15:11 i knew you were a good kid if if if if you had declined i would have had to eat you so yeah so
00:15:17 he's now a yeah now he's now a grand kid of to this demon he has to go to demon school where
00:15:23 everyone chants about how much they like eating humans and suck them dry and and heal them and
00:15:29 stuff and and yeah he's a human and he has to endure he has to be uh he has to go to the school
00:15:35 and be there and pretend he's a demon and the funny thing is it's like he accidentally becomes an
00:15:41 absolute badass that runs the school in a way without meaning to it's just it's just great it's
00:15:48 like it's sort of like absurd comedy in a way but like it makes sense in a way like it escalates into
00:15:54 things but it doesn't it doesn't go past a certain point where it becomes too ridiculous to be
00:16:00 unbelievable for the setting all right is it is it just sort of like uh the demons are uh they they
00:16:08 because they're like a different race the the the logic they have can be anything so it's just whatever
00:16:14 is really funny uh i mean they have their own logic uh that they follow they follow their own uh
00:16:22 the the the universal logic so it's not like low random i don't it's not it's not nature joe i would
00:16:29 say i i'd never like nature joe i know people like nature joe but it's not i'm surprised yeah i'm a
00:16:34 fan i if there's something i could compare it to for some reason like kaguya love is war it comes
00:16:41 to mind if anyone saw yeah okay yeah i i really love the comedy there and just like how it's a
00:16:47 that's kind of serious comedy for the for the baku man readers out there it's just like it's
00:16:52 it's such a simple premise and the comedy is just like how absurdly convoluted things yet
00:16:58 between them even though it's such just a simple matter in a way and it's something i don't know
00:17:04 why but it just like reminiscent to me of that and and i just did you ever did you ever play
00:17:09 diskaya i think it's it's either three or four which is about like a um ma i think it's a diskaya
00:17:16 i that's exactly right i think it's diskaya four where you play is no it's number three
00:17:21 fuck okay where you play as mau who is an honor student at like demon academy uh which means
00:17:26 that he has been truant every single day because in demon world you're a delinquent if you show up
00:17:32 to class so the number one what a twist what a twist so like the uh it's you you're mau you're
00:17:39 like an ace student so you never go to class or do your homework and uh like you're you're like
00:17:44 little friend you're like childhood friend girl is is a delinquent so she goes to school every day
00:17:49 and aces every test and is really committed to the bit and it's it's pathetic it's embarrassing
00:17:54 but you guys ever read helk i don't think so helk is a manga it starts off really strong it's about
00:18:01 like the demon world is holding a tournament to determine who will be the new demon king
00:18:08 and the demons hate humans but this dark horse candidate appears in the demon tournament competing
00:18:15 to be king and he is a human but all the demons love him and it's like what what's the deal and
00:18:21 like between rounds like and this human just like crushes all these demons at like every contest like
00:18:26 he's like damn he's really showing out he's really impressed and like between rounds like this
00:18:31 the demon reporter goes up he's like uh mr helk was it uh why are you why are you here in the demon
00:18:38 world competing like what's what's your story and he's just like looks at the crowd he's like
00:18:42 humans suck and everyone in the crowd's like yeah we love helk why does he hate humans uh he's got a
00:18:51 whole fucking backstory he's from like a kingdom that turned evil basically and he's like okay he's
00:18:55 like an exile for it it kind of gets worse as it goes on because he and like he and like the demon
00:19:03 like uh this like demon um accountant who works for the kingdom get like they get like teleported
00:19:09 somewhere and they have to like make their way back to the demon world to is this the guy turns
00:19:13 into like an episodic little like buddy comedy like uh you know travel uh fantasy kind of i don't
00:19:20 so it is this him is this human man the guy uh sorry let me let me look at what you're
00:19:25 with what you're doing yeah it's in the discord looks like an abby both gross discussing in the
00:19:29 normal pcp one yeah that looks like an absolute unit okay yeah that's helk that's helk uh it's pretty
00:19:35 it's pretty funny although i i quit reading it after a while because i was like yeah i think i
00:19:40 i get it you get the chan test what's another anime okay that you're loving oris key uh it has a
00:19:48 big all ass name uh but it translates to are you the one who loves me and initially initially it is
00:19:53 not gonna lie it had me in the first half i thought it was gonna be like a harem or love triangle or
00:19:58 something uh you know just your basic bitch anime uh but uh but oh it's so good it has it's it's
00:20:08 quite interesting i i also don't want to spoil the premise but like okay so it starts like this this
00:20:13 guy right he uh he's just a normal everyday school school guy he has a best friend named son
00:20:20 kunwal that's his nickname anywho so he has a childhood best friend and she's really cute and
00:20:25 happy and ganky and and there's even a panty shot it's just got annoyed by and then like this is
00:20:30 school school school school president that's also really pretty and and and she's cute and stuff and
00:20:37 he's like he he and it it and it looks like it looks like both of the girls have a crush on him
00:20:46 and um the he sort of sets up a date with each of them one day with one the other day with the other
00:20:53 and but it turns out that both of them have a crush on his best friend and they want his help with it
00:21:00 and it's and it's just like and there's a girl that likes him but he hates her
00:21:07 and it's just and it gets complicated sounds like a wacky situation but like the comedy there
00:21:13 comedy there is insane because like initially i i i didn't know what i was expecting but god
00:21:19 i was so surprised it was just he gets traumatized by a bench and out of context that sounds really
00:21:25 silly but it makes sense but even with with context it's also really silly and it's hilarious
00:21:30 it's even more hilarious with context because you know why that bench traumatizes him and i
00:21:35 wonder if they're gonna keep the bench coming back every episode will the bench be a recurring
00:21:40 character yeah exactly it's in the opening it's in the opening the bench is in the open yeah i
00:21:46 like that all right it's great i love it it's it's it's definitely a comedy i would recommend
00:21:52 because not only is it like top-notch comedy it's also like it has like it ends in such a
00:21:57 suspenseful cliffhanger on the first episode and and then like the second episode also ends in a
00:22:02 cliffhanger and just like oh shit what's gonna happen next and it's just like i'm so intrigued
00:22:07 because there's like one of the characters is weaving a web of lies and deceit and it's just it's
00:22:13 i want to see how it plays out because everyone is playing into it like puppets on strings and it's
00:22:18 just oh boy it's so good i didn't expect it to be so good also the art is really nice as well
00:22:24 the way they draw the lips for the girls is is quite interesting it's a bit different it's a bit
00:22:29 more detailed what's it called uh oresuki it is in short but also i can't spell this
00:22:34 fuck bullshit okay are you the one who loves me that that one i want to see these so-called lips
00:22:43 as do i you really should have procured an image for us mage it was very unfortunate i'll google it
00:22:49 and find you well mage hey here go ahead and do that or or a suki or a suki
00:22:59 any fucking day now oh i see i see what you mean oh they got little they got little baby lips
00:23:05 for the love of god link it ben plush plush little okay well this is not a high particularly
00:23:12 high res it's fine
00:23:17 i love talking about visuals on an audio podcast
00:23:24 we can just describe we can just just like describe the pixel by pixel by pixel like
00:23:29 say that it's just like out loud oh that's good that's good there's enough there's a bonus episode
00:23:34 idea just we just talk about images the whole time and we don't link any of the images at the end
00:23:40 oh that's a good idea no it's a good idea here's a better bonus episode idea um we show images on
00:23:45 an audio show but we don't say anything oh good call good call it's even less work i mean more
00:23:51 avant-garde oh hey why don't we why don't we put in like two thousands like music just to go
00:23:58 like uh like a link in park am v this like with like the transition of like the spinning images to
00:24:04 transition between the still and we just get like like for whatever topic we talk about we just have
00:24:09 an image on screen but like no audio and then it changes to a different image and people have to
00:24:13 guess what we were talking about this episode of the procrastiners podcast is brought to you by
00:24:18 windows xp movie maker the premiere movie editing application for all your youtube needs okay all
00:24:26 right guys i have a life update uh speaking of misha uh mage here was mentioning spinning a
00:24:30 web of lies this was not an intentional lie i'm i'm so glad that munchie isn't here munchie would uh
00:24:38 would destroy me he's around he could have been i don't know maybe he's probably got a lecture or
00:24:43 something it's probably gonna learning to do god it's sunday it's the lord's day not in my america
00:24:49 well so so here's the here's the cinch everybody so we had to take sesho to get his uh it was like
00:24:55 time to renew his heart worm medicine or whatever it is so we have to renew his heart gotta get a new
00:25:00 yes now when we got sesho sesho is a corgi and beagle mix he's a mutt freak and so he's hard
00:25:08 to know what he's supposed to be like oh i saw a dog whoa no way um the other the other the other
00:25:16 day there was a hole into your conversation that's no go on go on there was a dog here uh uh some
00:25:21 some people were over one of them brought one of not their dog but like a friend of a friend's dog
00:25:26 and this dog oh what's his name
00:25:30 his name was buttons and he was a pug doxon do i say doxon right or is it dash dash
00:25:41 it's like german pronunciation so we're never gonna get okay well i say doxon i don't know if
00:25:45 it's correct someone correct me in the comments okay well it was a a pug doxon mix named buttons
00:25:52 and he i don't not look much of an animal lover but boy this was a cute dog this was a well-behaved
00:25:57 dog he's quiet he just like flopped over on his belly whenever you went and go pet him
00:26:01 he couldn't go he could only go upstairs but not down them uh it was pretty cool pretty cool
00:26:07 dog sorry just over the course of his life he just keeps getting higher and higher
00:26:14 that's really an aspirational way of living i only go up i never yeah i respect that he's
00:26:20 literally incapable okay oh it's like that time in one piece where uh zoro was fighting me hawk
00:26:26 and me hawk was like why do you not step back zoro and zoro said i feel like if i step backward
00:26:31 i'll lose everything so me hawk he didn't step back yeah that's that's that's buttons that's one
00:26:36 piece um that's my that's my uh catchphrase okay so here's the deal i took my dog to the vet sesho
00:26:44 lord sechomaru please address him by his full name and they said so he got his shots he was fine
00:26:49 he was a good brave little soldier but then at the end they were like okay so when you first
00:26:54 got sesho all right he weighed about 17 pounds he may have been a little bit underweight he may
00:27:00 have been a little bit underweight at that time well they they looked into it and they were like
00:27:05 um sesho's probably a little bit heavier than uh he should be and i've been we've been lowering his
00:27:13 who could have seen this coming it this is no one could have possibly not no it's not true
00:27:19 and damn that's one rubenesque dog in short in short sesho went from 17 pounds to 27 pounds
00:27:27 i was gonna i was gonna say do we want to guess do we want to like okay well i guess i was gonna
00:27:32 guess like 30 but no okay he was he's 20 in this very picture here snoozing his life away
00:27:39 it's in the gross links chat or whatever he's 27 pounds apparently that fat second shit you
00:27:46 gotta hit the gym sesho you gotta hit that's a potato and uh in short he needs to lose probably
00:27:52 about like five pounds i mean imagine you weigh let's say like 180 pounds that's you know approximately
00:27:58 average for a male and then you go to 280 pounds like that's approximately the the the change of
00:28:05 look what you've done yeah so i sesho i apologize uh i didn't realize if only someone someone
00:28:12 close to you could have given you warnings weeks or months ago i just didn't trust you guys i just
00:28:18 don't trust your judgment on any of this i have a dog and he's extremely healthy if only if only
00:28:24 someone could have told him so on his special day you might say with the greatest gift of
00:28:32 honesty yeah there you go there you go it's like that calvin and hobbes strip where he's just
00:28:39 sitting at the booth and he's selling for five cents and it's like a lemonade stand but instead of
00:28:44 that it's a frank appraisal of your looks ooh that's a good one oh what a fucking best
00:28:51 mediocre at best that's uh that's a what do you do when you take him for walks do you like throw a
00:28:56 ball does he run around no we pretty well the the longest walks we do we just take like a longer
00:29:03 walk that's maybe like a 15 to 20 minute just you know walk we just walk no really he's got he's
00:29:08 got to get sprinting he's got to get chasing something he does race around inside some but
00:29:13 i mean obviously that's going to be a limited he'll he'll just he'll do the neumes where he just
00:29:17 runs up and down the hallway for no reason uh don't know why he's doing it but getting one of those
00:29:22 exercise machines like where were you we can get like a uh get like a tennis ball that squeaks or
00:29:28 something that he'll like yeah we got we got things of this nature all right well we well
00:29:32 we're gonna work on me and him we're gonna we're gonna punch the heavy bag oh that poor chunk
00:29:38 it's all right sessho look at you sort it out um so there's there's the sessho up got i really i
00:29:44 really i really want to meet that dog i want to meet that boy i i miss like why what what does
00:29:50 munchie have to do with this munchie has been fat shaming my dog since day one frankly it's
00:29:55 fucked up and i don't respect his opinion uh on that or anything else so you know i just i'm glad
00:30:01 he's not here to gloat and to pretend he knew things he could have known for real revel in that
00:30:07 poor dog suffering exactly exactly he's i can i'll do that for him i can do that for the both of us
00:30:14 i just want him to be healthy so we're gonna we're gonna fix it we're gonna sort this shit out
00:30:18 so there you go there's there's sessho update uh oh actually sorry one other thing about sessho
00:30:24 was just um we went to a pumpkin patch yesterday and we were walking around saw those images oh
00:30:30 this is a good michelle's post and some of those this is a good segue for my next topic okay well
00:30:34 good this will be brief uh you know uh here there are michelle posted some on her twitter uh let me
00:30:40 let me see if i can get them while i'm saying this it was just the funny thing about it was
00:30:44 me and michelle uh we took sessho to walk around we we thought it was the same one we'd been to
00:30:49 four turns out it was different didn't really matter it was a good time and um uh dogs actually
00:30:55 were not allowed in but like no one said anything so we just got in anyway so i mean that was convenient
00:30:59 and good uh so we were in we were walking around doing stuff and um we noticed that like okay so
00:31:05 i'm it's it's it's one of these things where i'm noticing that i'm at the point in life where people
00:31:10 approximately my age maybe a little bit older are there like with their children
00:31:15 and it's me and michelle there with our dog and like this you say that like it's you say that
00:31:20 like it's weird that's not weird it's not super weird but like i am noticing this difference uh
00:31:27 you know between me and these other people no i feel you i have a cat i have a senior
00:31:31 old cat he's my baby who needs well maybe it's time to go full hashtag breeder mage no i think
00:31:36 it's time to make the transition i'm only gonna have more cats well that's that's just fine that's
00:31:42 just fine um oh here you go here's hello plumpkin oh that's adorable he's loving the pumpkins that's
00:31:49 pretty cute um and oh yo there's more well we'll get more easier one worship my dog feed sesho on
00:31:55 like on uncertain times during the day or do you just feed sesho in the morning in the evening
00:32:00 and we were just giving him a little bit too much food you're reducing his rations we are
00:32:04 that's correct that's correct and look at that that last pic he's just all head
00:32:09 yeah he's all smiles oh look at him oh he's he's very him michelle will freak out when she hears
00:32:16 this section so let's talk about pumpkins yeah go for it go for it oh who's that other dog oh
00:32:21 fuck sesho who's this other dog that's a that's a plastic dog that is a fake dog oh look at how
00:32:26 oh you're right it's a beagle we think it's sesho's father encased in carbonite do you
00:32:31 say sesho's part beagle yeah he's like half god look at that more unrealistic expectations for dog
00:32:36 beauty disgusting i know this is like in this in this image i can really see how much of a chunk
00:32:43 sesho is but he says that's fucked up of you to say i mean it in an endearing way i mean like he
00:32:49 did does need to lose weight but like oh he's so cute oh Jesus the fact let me find a picture of my
00:32:55 dog okay oh we can talk about how much fitter your dog is in fact i got a video i got a video of
00:33:02 him running at max speed oh max speed what's your what's your dog's name hippo sonny sonny sonny
00:33:08 oh sesho why can't you be more like sonny i hear i hear sonny's sonny's gonna be a doster sonny's
00:33:13 got a job at the bank sonny's doing just great in life all right i'm supposed to go my sense of
00:33:19 throwing the ball thing and off he goes i'm watching it i'm here in this room
00:33:24 that's a speedy boy all right do you have like a do you have like a like ball throwing lever
00:33:30 device yeah for like maximum distance for greater ball leverage he's very fast so you need that to
00:33:36 throw it far enough he's so cute look at me so happy ego oh what's the proximity of this dog park or
00:33:43 just normal park to your house i'm just curious it's like a i don't know like five sort of minute
00:33:53 walk from my house not that far that's like five five to ten don't duck yourself yeah he went into
00:33:58 the river because he likes to like like cool off every so often just toss that ball into the river
00:34:03 and get him get him going downstream he used to he used to like not bring the ball back but it was
00:34:08 like it's funny because like you know we had him since he was a tiny puppy and we've been training
00:34:12 him to like like obey orders bring the ball back or we won't be able to throw it for you you idiot
00:34:17 and he eventually learned how he learns to bring it back he's um oh he's a little bit more than one
00:34:24 year old oh okay so he's a new dog how nice yeah he's even younger than sesha right yeah yeah yeah
00:34:31 sesha's like two and already and already ahead in life no no no sesha's bulking for his for his
00:34:38 summer cuts in the uh in the gains department so yeah don't you worry about that it's like that uh
00:34:45 you ever see that post on um i don't know like a bodybuilding forum or something where someone's

00:35:02 oh that's good shit
00:35:09 um never you just skip that part no no no that's secondary um it's all about diet um
00:35:17 the so it's being a pump let's talk about how much i hate halloween okay let's talk about
00:35:22 how halloween is the worst holiday what no there's plenty worse but i was loving the vibe i mean
00:35:29 the vibe yesterday at the pumpkin patch was great we had we had hot a apple cider
00:35:33 when we walked around in the cool air it felt great so you're gonna be i'm a hard sell on
00:35:37 this i don't mind the fall aesthetic i like think i like cider the colors are fine uh you know i
00:35:44 don't mind that it's getting cold um i don't still nice i don't um i was gonna say something oh like
00:35:50 i'm not a snob about like pumpkin spice lattes or whatever like that's fine pumpkin spice tastes
00:35:55 good um i just don't like halloween i don't i don't like it there are there are less consequential
00:36:01 holidays like there's um i don't know uh uh uh veterans day i don't celebrate veterans day like
00:36:08 who cares like whatever okay um hates the troops understood i just i just i just i don't want to
00:36:14 do any of the things that are associated with halloween you don't have to i don't you gotta you
00:36:19 have to fuck sluts on halloween it's the thing it's the american tradition and you're not going to
00:36:24 do it i don't you'll just go unfucked ban and is that pumpkin spice is good i'm i'll i'll i'll
00:36:31 i'll stand up i'll put my neck out for pumpkin spice but um i don't want to put on a costume i
00:36:35 don't want to see other people in their costumes i don't want to trick or treat or to receive trick
00:36:41 or treaters i don't want i don't like uh uh uh plastic skeletons the home invasion aspect of
00:36:48 halloween has always been a bit like move out of usa all your problems will be solved uh i mean
00:36:54 i don't like carving jack-o-lanterns uh i don't like i love carving jack-o-lanterns that's the
00:36:59 best bit i want to carve one one it's it's because it's like it's like a sculpture thing but like
00:37:04 it's not weird to do it like like you can't cut i mean i you can technically like buy like a pineapple
00:37:11 or like a watermelon and carve it at any time um but you never think unless it's halloween
00:37:18 yeah like i didn't think it was out and like lighting it like making like a reference to
00:37:23 like homestuck or bail jpeg or whatever uh really fun one year i did one year i did carve a uh
00:37:29 candy corn vampire uh problem sleuth jack-o-lantern which was good it was good um the i did like in
00:37:36 in um what's in gravity and gravity falls they do summer wean and they just do it with with uh
00:37:42 yeah uh uh watermelons maybe yeah that's pretty cute um no i'm the i am the grinch of halloween
00:37:51 and i know that the grinch had a halloween movie but that doesn't count what yeah yeah yeah there's
00:37:57 this i i don't know the night before the grinch i didn't know grinch is in a halloween movie where
00:38:03 he i don't know tries to hashtag cancel halloween or whatever didn't you learn a lesson the first
00:38:09 time i don't know if dr seuss was involved with that one at all or if the studio is just like
00:38:13 we gotta make a sequel guys so wait a minute what what like does he like forcibly make people not
00:38:19 scared as that like he calms everyone down that's what he does i haven't seen it so i couldn't tell
00:38:25 you what the plot is but i have some guesses from the love from the love that he learned from
00:38:31 christmas he decides to spread it to halloween and ruins the spirit of the whole thing by making
00:38:36 people feel okay apparently it's called halloween is grinch that's what i just said and it's written
00:38:43 by dr seuss it was written by dr seuss how bizarre and about that and the grinch has like
00:38:49 orange eyes he's got scary orange eyes in this one maybe the grinch's grievance is that like this
00:38:55 is like his people's holiday and this is cultural appropriation as a ghoul or goblin himself uh
00:39:00 which i presume that he is he's an abominable gremlin is he just like a fucked up whoville
00:39:07 citizen who you know moved away and i think you know i think that the the implication is that he's
00:39:13 like he doesn't shave and he's green because he's ugly and stinky i agree i agree i think he's one
00:39:21 of the whoville people just fucked up or something isn't that what happened in the jim carrey movie he
00:39:26 was like adopted or something he was like one of them but uh well jim carried the actor uh yeah when
00:39:31 he played the grinch you know what i'm saying i'm reading the plots in opposite it was just overgrown
00:39:38 with hair good it's just like no okay so the grinch does not steal halloween and in fact
00:39:46 in spite of the name of the movie there is no halloween in this world there is only
00:39:51 grinch night which just is their version of okay and it's basically just grinch fucking abducts a
00:39:58 child and puts him in his drug wagon and gets the kid high and the kid just has a bad trip
00:40:07 but he doesn't like he i guess he he doesn't like actually die of terror and so the grinch has failed
00:40:14 in his quest and is defeated and that's it so all the spook of halloween is condensed into one
00:40:21 small child and the idea is just to spook this one guy as hard as possible to whatever effect his
00:40:27 desire dude that's like that time in one piece when luffy got pulled put all the shadows in him to
00:40:32 like as much halloween as possible to defeat like that to defeat us that place was definitely
00:40:38 halloween coded so there's no doubt about that um thriller bark that is of course so i guess i'm
00:40:45 not the grinch halloween because it seems like the grinch is actually like the grinch is out and
00:40:49 about like yeah grinch night is his night you're you're that child on on grinch night yeah i'm
00:40:55 that child who refuses to get spooked who doesn't whose toes don't come off because i guess that
00:41:01 that's the challenge is like i'm gonna scare your toes off but his toes don't come off so he's like
00:41:05 darn time let me get my axe i'll get you i have been making a slight effort to uh uh do spooky
00:41:13 things i've watched several horror movies including uh the exorcist three after red letter media did
00:41:19 their review and it was revealed to me it's not a completely terrible movie saw that review good
00:41:23 review good movie liked it um and i watched last night i watched mid samar i was finally able to
00:41:29 acquire mid samar and uh that that did indeed spook me to my core mostly because like because
00:41:35 like the bad guys just won and that made me sad and like feel bad about humanity and i lost faith
00:41:41 for a while but then i got it back uh so that was all right speaking of spooky i finished watching
00:41:48 like season nine of of the walking way i was gonna talk about oh you're still talking about i was
00:41:53 i was going to talk about what i think about halloween but if walking dead is okay we'll get
00:41:57 there yeah yeah so i and it just it it wrecked me i knew i knew it was coming i knew like why
00:42:05 does nine seasons of that so far nine seasons that just terrified me i'm so still going yeah it's
00:42:12 still going there's wait i said the wire right talking about the wire zombie scare me the walking
00:42:17 dead okay yeah i've been saying that has to end for as long as it's been going on as far as i
00:42:22 funny thing is okay they just started season 10 there's a spin-off called if you're the walking
00:42:27 dead it's on season five and i think there's gonna be another spin-off uh starting at some point
00:42:35 and that's not counting all the little smaller spin-offs that's already been i remember watching
00:42:39 season one and thinking like hey this is a pretty cool show it's it's gotten it's gotten really good
00:42:45 like at first it was okay then it got really bad and then it started getting better now it's quite
00:42:50 good again is it good again i'm i'll believe you i'm i'm willing to believe that but i think my
00:42:58 window of care has definitely passed i mean it's fine yeah it's fine i don't expect anyone else to
00:43:04 care but it's just like with season nine it's just like the way the end it is just i hate how they
00:43:09 i hate how they make me care about characters and then you just kill them off like that like the way
00:43:14 they did i just spend nine seasons since you get the pattern by now i think they call that the cock
00:43:20 carousel huh what nothing is uh is fan favorite norman readus still a character is alive
00:43:30 do you mean like he regrams or what no i don't know what his character's name is
00:43:36 from um he's the guy with the crossbow yeah yeah deal yeah yeah he's still alive he's one of my
00:43:42 favorite characters and there's no norman readus from um that that kojima um yeah he's the main
00:43:47 character and death stranding who's the other no no i wasn't norman rockwell who's the other
00:43:53 guy who worked on death stranding i mean of many people guillermo del toro guillermo yeah guillermo
00:43:59 del toro aka norman rockwell why the fuck did i almost say norman rockwell okay whatever moving on
00:44:04 okay but what do you think of halloween i just want to quickly say it's like the daryl uh and and carol
00:44:09 are my two favorite characters and they're all in carol yeah uh they are they're also best friends
00:44:14 and then i think carol's still alive yeah she's such a good character though i love her she and and
00:44:19 and the character and i'm so mad huh wasn't she like dying or something did she have like some
00:44:24 sort of like sickness and now she's not dying anymore no no i don't remember about any sort of
00:44:29 sickness no maybe i'm making this up maybe you're misremembering the character it's been a while
00:44:36 sounds like it uh i mean she died she dies in the comics but uh maybe i'm gonna do that i did
00:44:42 read those for a little bit yeah but she she's such a good character he's one of my favorites and
00:44:47 they hurt her and i'm mad like i the character the character they oft didn't care too much about him
00:44:52 i mean it's sad but like but they hurt her and that's what makes me angry because like she's finally
00:44:58 she was finally happy she was finally happy and they hurt her so i'm mad how can you be happy
00:45:04 again the world of zombies it's impossible she she managed to find happiness she was so
00:45:10 wrecked she went through so much the things were so bad for her and she was finally i mean that's
00:45:15 the that's the thing as soon as the characters arc is complete and they achieve happiness they can
00:45:20 either kill them off or fuck with it because they just or ignore them i know there's the three options
00:45:25 it was just i i know i that's why i knew it was coming but i'm still mad i'm mad it's it's the
00:45:34 it's one of those things like whoever finishes the arc at the same time the show ends is the only
00:45:39 person who gets to live in something like this like if they finish their arc earlier they're
00:45:44 dead wait so they either have to die or they have to leave the show in some other way indeed it's the
00:45:50 only way to stay alive like uh rick protecting his son or did he die i don't you know i don't know
00:45:56 okay okay rick is assumed to be dead but there's gonna be a movie with him so yeah well yeah there
00:46:03 you go but like he's been missing like canonically from the story for like several years now
00:46:09 oh i like how movie is still a term we use like it's such an old fashioned old-timey
00:46:16 sort of it is how it's not i try i try to say i at various points i've tried to switch to saying
00:46:21 film but it's never stuck i mean film i think i used to say film yeah but film makes more sense
00:46:28 film is like a more what's the difference honestly tell me explain the differences i mean they mean
00:46:32 the same thing they mean the same thing but like movie is derivative of of like talky
00:46:39 because like a movie is like it it's moving pictures wow and a talky is like oh they added
00:46:46 sound now you can hear it that's that they called them talkies for a while but that was stupid so
00:46:50 they changed back to movies and film is like the the thing they used to film it on that's what it's
00:46:56 called um so like both are like i guess movie is more descriptive of what you're what it is
00:47:03 because it's not shot on film anymore unless it unless it's quentin taratino
00:47:08 but yeah i don't know i think about that a lot of how the words are weird like computer it's just
00:47:12 like it's computing it's a computer it's doing quite a bit of computing still it's just like it's
00:47:17 such a simple term you know it's just like we didn't like we didn't really come up with a word for it
00:47:21 we just kind of like described what it did and said it's and then like other other languages and
00:47:27 like other languages like okay correct me if i'm wrong but i think in japanese the word is just
00:47:31 like komputa or something that's correct that's and like it's like they could have they could have
00:47:35 just uh used like you know made up their own word that also describes its function like nah
00:47:40 this word standardized we'll just take this one is there is there like a japanese word for cake
00:47:44 because all i've ever heard is this cakey yeah cakey i mean there are there are many japanese
00:47:50 desserts but they use the word cake all the time i mean i mean i mean cake cake cake as we normally
00:47:55 think of it as like a western dish so yeah that's makes sense it's the same way that a cookie no
00:48:02 actually that's not the same or whatever uh but like words right where was i going with this what
00:48:09 was the thing well like how about like a waffle like a waffle is a very specific dish and you know
00:48:15 you can't call that anything but what would be awful because a cultural shit we could make up a
00:48:19 new word for it the dutch word i think right yeah oh yeah computer like i think did computing exist
00:48:26 before computer did they have to come up with a term for what this is yeah yeah i mean i mean you
00:48:31 can do i mean it's math called computation in your head or on paper i mean that's what they
00:48:37 they designed a computer initially to take the heavy lifting out of doing traditional mathematical
00:48:42 computation hence the name computer i would assume okay i i always assumed it was like named after the
00:48:48 device and like maybe the first ones were called like uh electric uh abacuses or whatever yeah that
00:48:54 would be a calculator doing calculations right uh i guess i guess calculation was already a word
00:49:01 yeah calculation yeah and computation as well see i can't i can't divorce computation from the
00:49:07 computer as a word uh fucking fucking zoomer back in my day we back in my day we used uh we just
00:49:14 counted on our hands and back in our day and then they invented the abacus and everyone got lazy
00:49:20 and it all went did you have everyone lost their minds then did you have the weird you go to math
00:49:25 class and they'd hand out the uh the blue calculators with like the white buttons and you'd have to do
00:49:30 calculations on there but then they take them away for the tests the scientific calculators like the
00:49:34 yeah the sign like the ti 83 uh that too but that's not what i was talking about like elton
00:49:39 they gave out like they'd give pass around the class these dinky little like
00:49:43 bright blue calculators with white buttons and they'd be like now do your times tables
00:49:48 bitch but you can't use it on the tests so we're teaching you how to do something that we're not
00:49:53 going to let you do when it counts mickey mouse teach you math yeah yeah that's how everybody
00:49:58 talked back then i know it's been said before but remember in school when they would say you can't
00:50:03 use a calculator on the test you think you're gonna have you think you're gonna have a computer in
00:50:07 your pocket to do all your calculations for you in the real world oh it's night it's 1992 and the
00:50:14 future is bleak children we're at the end of history die that's what we should have said
00:50:27 probably we knew before i talked about the walking dead you wanted to talk about halloween
00:50:33 oh yeah yeah it's not here but hippo is halloween hot take it's not really a hot take it's just
00:50:40 i appreciate like the aesthetic of all of the halloween e things like pumpkins ghost skeletons
00:50:48 the the quote-unquote spooky stuff that um but like i hate scary things anything that's actually
00:50:55 scary i'm like yeah i'll pass i won't thanks i'd never look at scary movies i only i only
00:51:03 like same like funny things that have scary things in them like nightmare before christmas is
00:51:07 obviously like a fun movie that has scary things in it um and uh that's why i like pumpkins and
00:51:15 vampires and ghouls doing things that are goofy rather than scary things i am so torn because i
00:51:22 like scary things but also i hate scary things so i just i can't i cannot exist i don't i don't
00:51:28 like scary things i'm over i'm over spooky things even things that aren't scary but are
00:51:33 just quote-unquote spooky no i'm over it it's done when i played silent hill 2 it opened my eyes and
00:51:39 i began to appreciate scary things and now i watch them they do disturb me deeply mid-summer
00:51:45 kind of fucked me up yesterday i was very spooked and scared but more than not like that there was
00:51:50 like no jump scares in the movie there's a couple but mostly it was just like in the x you know
00:51:56 actually was funny i mentioned the exorcist before i was watching i mean this was in uh like red
00:52:01 litter media's review but they talked about how the writer of the books was working with the director
00:52:06 the director just wanted to make a cool movie and like didn't give a fuck about like the message
00:52:10 behind it or anything uh or you know something along those lines and but the author was very
00:52:14 concerned about the message and they were doing an interview and the guy like the the director was
00:52:19 like i wanted to have like a big finish wanted to like blah blah do this because spoilers at the
00:52:23 end of the exorcist they the guy performs the exorcism the devil comes out of the little girl
00:52:28 possesses him and in that moment he hurls himself out the window and like kills himself
00:52:33 thus killing the demon which is currently in him um and like the the the the writer the author the
00:52:39 screen guy was very concerned that people would perceive this as like the devil successfully
00:52:45 killing someone as opposed to the priest doing a heroic sacrifice to like delete the devil from
00:52:51 this girl's brain or whatever and he's just like in the interview he's just like man i just don't
00:52:55 want the people to think that the devil won and you could see how deeply this was important to him
00:53:00 that people get the message of like hope and and goodness and inspiration as opposed to bad things
00:53:06 win but in fucking Midsommar there's just a bunch of human sacrifices and frankly it all goes like
00:53:13 clockwork and it's great and everyone yay we did it uh we killed the guys and good for us
00:53:19 they were kind of jerks and that's it we win happy endings aren't that scary they can be terrifying
00:53:26 i mean it depends it depends uh you know what i mean can a happy ending be scary okay i watch
00:53:31 the bad guys happy it depends on what you mean by happy ending like if if you it does depend it
00:53:37 like like in a in a horror movie a happy ending usually means uh surviving getting out safely
00:53:43 right yes but even then they'll give you a jump scare at the end i mean a great example of like
00:53:48 things with happy endings that can still be terrifying is like anything like cosmic horror
00:53:52 right because you've you've been revealed that there's so much more going on than humans even
00:53:57 have context or the capacity to understand and so it just recontextualizes all of like life
00:54:03 and even if you get away from it it's like well what i thought was meaningful now is meaningless
00:54:08 in the face of this greater truth i'm like that can be a happy ending but it's because like the
00:54:13 character survived they got away they didn't die but like the world's fucking totally different
00:54:18 now dude i'm not even sure i call that a happy ending necessarily but yeah what if like i mean
00:54:22 i guess it's down to the guy there's there's the guy in the monster and he guys like oh
00:54:27 shit there's the monster he's fucking killing my friends but then he kills the monster but
00:54:34 he he he was sleeping he didn't actually kill the monster he was just being eaten alive while
00:54:40 asleep oh no darn i hate when that happens cut to black or like at the end uh what was it
00:54:48 fucking baguille or whatever just shows up for one frame right before we cut to black with a big
00:54:53 right right the lazy you know showing off one frame it's like a youtube thing i like
00:54:58 spooky things but i hate things that make me feel sad and and like i have a very weird
00:55:05 capacity for what things make me sad like i cannot take it when like old people are being abused
00:55:10 or die or or just something like that something something about that it just makes me die boomers
00:55:17 die super upset it's just like i watched i was watching duro and i liked duro but there was one
00:55:22 one part one one part about like this guy he kind of banded his old mom uh and and like uh she she
00:55:29 clung to him but he thought it was like the monster so he swiped with his sword backwards and
00:55:34 cut off her hand and and he didn't even realize up until he came back uh to his village and that he
00:55:40 realized oh shit you know his mom clung to him for help and he was so scared that he loved her behind
00:55:45 not only did he leave her behind but he cut off his hand her hand when she tried to cling to him
00:55:50 and it's it's still hurting me it's still hurting me on the inside there's a there's a movie there's
00:55:57 a movie called um uh drag me to hell which is uh i watched it years ago and uh i mean it's it's
00:56:05 like over the top in a way that is like comical a lot of the time but it's still like you guys seen
00:56:09 it you guys seen drag me to hell i'm aware of it i have seen it that's it it is um it's kind of kooky
00:56:16 but it's also like genuinely scary in a lot of places and it has like a big fucking like you
00:56:22 think there's gonna be a happy ending but then it's like no everything's the worst like right at
00:56:27 the end and it's like it's so miserable it left me like it let me like emotionally bereft i was like
00:56:34 i can't i can't i can't live in a world they should have done they should have done a social media
00:56:40 campaign share your stories it wasn't fair no it wasn't fair what happened to her she didn't deserve it
00:56:46 yeah don't you i i hate that i hate that that's not cool yeah i mean i'm typically not a huge
00:56:51 fan of horror movies because they tend to go for like like low hanging fruit scares it's yeah i mean
00:56:58 they're a great one there are exceptions of course yeah but like there are some there on the one hand
00:57:04 there's like the low hanging fruit stuff like the stuff that like rate pg-13 and full of jump scares
00:57:09 just to like get money from children around halloween you know and then they also and like
00:57:14 good horror movies a lot of the times they rely on like the visual aspect like really like intense
00:57:18 gore and stuff and i'm not usually hugely into that either there's a movie called uh creep and it
00:57:24 is a horror movie it's not supernatural at all the premise is basically just i won't go too much
00:57:30 into the specifics but it's basically just our protagonist is just like hired to do a job by this
00:57:36 guy and he goes to meet this guy and he's for a while he's trapped he's kind of is isolated with
00:57:42 the guy and it's just about like this guy seems kind of off like oh he's he's really off like
00:57:49 why is he acting this way like what like and like it it uh it's just it's just the horror of like
00:57:57 i've i've met this person who is so off-putting and i am genuinely scared of like what they're
00:58:03 going to do but i don't know because i'm definitely more of a fan of like the esoteric or like
00:58:08 psychological horror of where it's just like instead of like presenting like a very tangible
00:58:13 physical thing it kind of lets your mind fill in the blanks with its own worst-case scenario
00:58:18 because you never know because like this guy is like he's like a liar but like you kind of have
00:58:23 to like like sometimes it seems like you know like in the same way that he's like he's like
00:58:27 tricking and manipulating this character into like thinking like no no no that was just a joke
00:58:31 that was just a joke it's like you the audience are like like how much like like what is the real
00:58:37 what's this guy actually like like is like how much is this uh like he's be he's gas lighting
00:58:41 you he gas lights you the audience and it's like really yuck movies are scary understood but it's
00:58:49 all pussy shit it's all pussy shit compared to legitimately scary video games like silent
00:58:57 hill too that game was so fucking hard to get through it was brutal to try like just watching
00:59:05 a movie it's gonna keep playing just close your eyes you'll be fine but with a game you have to
00:59:10 do it right you have to go into the room you have to oh my god you have to like reach in with your
00:59:15 character into the fucking hole grab the key and you can feel the fucking vibration is something's
00:59:19 touching you it's you playing the fucking game it's a new level if you want two spooks man go play
00:59:25 silent hill two and three it's a shame that they'll never be another good silent hill game well yeah
00:59:30 did you hear about the new silent hill game that just came out like a few days ago oh what is it
00:59:35 i don't care about that shit that's is it a phone game no it's not bad it's a little sucks we all
00:59:40 we all know that konami sucks well i i want to talk about video games as like okay the the more
00:59:45 scary medium because i lied before i do like scary things um specifically in a video game
00:59:52 but not just because you are like your actions and inaction like are constantly causing all like
01:00:00 you know you're constantly uh responsible for whether or not you're being killed right now
01:00:07 in certain video games but it's also the fact that if you if you're in certain video games if
01:00:12 there's like not really a character you can skip all of the boring parts of the movie where
01:00:17 they have to set up characters that you have to care about so that when they die it's scary
01:00:22 like i don't when it's you who is the character you know who you are you don't want to die
01:00:29 so you can skip all that and you can just get straight to the scary parts which is why
01:00:33 i love five nights at freddy's let's plays by markiplier because i can i don't have to play
01:00:39 the game but i can sit there with him and and look around the screen like is there a bear kona
01:00:45 is there a bear coming for you are you gonna be able to survive the night oh my god
01:00:51 wait is this a hard game just about being stalked by a bear
01:00:54 oh you don't know what five nights at freddy's is oh five sorry i checked out okay okay like
01:01:01 you're a hunter just in the woods and the monster the idea you just pitch sounds immensely interesting
01:01:06 though and i kind of wanted to exist now yeah like it's just as scary as anything else you could
01:01:11 think of it might be stalking you you'll be just you'll be just as dead whether the thing that gets
01:01:17 you is a bear or the babadook or whatever or freddy fazbear of fry i don't i don't like playing
01:01:24 hard games but uh no go ahead people the the the purest distillation of like fear in a video game
01:01:30 is just like a game where it's dark and you have to press a button to move forward and at any moment
01:01:37 something could happen and even if you don't do anything something could happen and that's it
01:01:42 it's just a game you press forward or you don't press forward and you're like oh god click
01:01:47 click like i would i would play that game i would shit myself and i would have a great time
01:01:52 and there wouldn't even need to be anything there i i would need to believe those the last
01:01:58 actual horror game that i played was fatal frame two and i loved it i to this day i still like
01:02:04 remember things about it that i absolutely adored um like in somewhere near the beginning of the game
01:02:11 you explore the house and you find like diary pages of like a woman searching for her husband
01:02:16 or something like that and she's lost in the village and stuff and and the very final final
01:02:21 piece you find it's it's like several pages like the first page is like i don't know i can't go on
01:02:26 it's like i i hope i i hope i i'll find you or something like that and it's like it's a blank
01:02:31 page and then you turn the page blank page you turn the page blank page for a few pages last page
01:02:36 so it's like found you or something like that and you put it down and suddenly you get attacked
01:02:40 like by the but the ghost of the woman that was like here and it's just like oh it was so spooky
01:02:46 to experience it but like it shivers down my spine like and it was such a fun experience and then like
01:02:52 later this house um was where there were like two twin girls and and at the one of the girls had to
01:02:58 be sacrificed and uh the girl was so sad about losing her sister that the dad made a doll that
01:03:05 looked just like her and the doll a doll became possessed over time or something like that and
01:03:10 and it's just like i love i love reading the stories of how the people happen like how the
01:03:15 shit creepy stuff it's just i'm sorry i'm just like i'm getting overwhelmed with my
01:03:21 nerves about the game there's one great moment so many good things such a good game there's one
01:03:26 moment i always remember well the first time you see pyramid head in sound hill two is terrifying
01:03:30 he can't even get you but you see him through a grade but in sound hill three there's a moment
01:03:34 that's probably the scariest thing i've ever experienced in a game which is just you walk into
01:03:39 this room and there's a big mirror and you walk in and nothing happens and you walk you like try to
01:03:45 interact like you know you're trying to look for ammo or enemies there's nothing it's totally quiet
01:03:49 and then you go to leave and you click the door and it says the door is locked and it's the only
01:03:54 way out and then suddenly these like worm noises start to fall creep into your ear and you go back
01:03:59 to the mirror and you can see that like your whole body is being covered in like these fucking
01:04:04 disgusting ass like bloody tendrils or something and the whole mirror is getting fucked up and the
01:04:09 whole room is getting fucked up and of course you try the door again but it's still locked and you
01:04:13 can't get out and you try it again you still can't get out and then you have to try it like a bunch
01:04:17 of times and you can't escape but the whole time you're taking damage so you're freaking the
01:04:21 fuck out you don't know what to do oh my god it was very very spooky is the point okay this
01:04:27 reminds me i heard about this a while ago but and i kind of meant to ask you about it um do you
01:04:33 did you hear that like um uh you know you're a twin perfect you know twin perry you show you
01:04:38 show me of course uh do you know that like um there was kind of like a backlash against them at
01:04:43 some point because like was it not todd howard you know in their in their silent hill videos they
01:04:48 they harp a lot on this one guy and like he got a tom tom tom hulet yes tom hulet yes and they
01:04:55 harp a lot on this one guy's involvement and i think at some point people like he got a lot of
01:04:59 hate for it and it seems like maybe he wasn't as responsible as like yeah i saw that video you're
01:05:06 talking about yeah like like yeah there's a video where they yeah they they criticize uh twin perfect
01:05:10 a lot for how how hard they go on tom hulet and and maybe they were i mean they didn't like directly
01:05:16 incite anyone to harass the guy but like i don't like i think it's there was people definitely
01:05:21 harassed him and were like fuck you tom hulet after they put a lot of the blame on this
01:05:26 i don't know i don't know fungo apologized fungo apologized for but the other guy the whatever
01:05:31 his name is didn't rosseter i don't know i was yeah rosseter i was just interested because like
01:05:36 you showed me twin perfect and i love that uh silent hill series and then like i was kind of
01:05:43 but i didn't hear like anyone talking about it in like the broader discourse or whatever and then
01:05:48 to suddenly see it come up as the center of i don't know i mean controversy would probably be
01:05:53 overstating a bit but like people you know just yeah it pops up on social media like people are like
01:05:58 uh you know this this wasn't cool this was this was dumb and then i don't know i was interested
01:06:03 to see a particular into the public consciousness i didn't expect that yeah i remember that that
01:06:09 was interesting uh and those were the guys who got me into silent hill of course it was yeah you
01:06:14 you know they worked with fungo at first um they they haven't been terribly active recently
01:06:18 fungos but uh yeah indeed fungos streamer twin perfect themselves don't really upload much
01:06:23 fungo did a lot of blood borne content but i think stopped after a while i don't know
01:06:29 yeah he made a ton of very popular like blood borne lore videos explain okay which i thought
01:06:33 were very good they they were i watched a lot of those i know he vaped so that's pretty cool
01:06:38 i like i clicked his channel like one time just to see like what it was about and i watched a
01:06:42 little bit of video and he like he vaped on i was like yeah brother in arms i actually i did do a
01:06:49 little research just out of curiosity i there was i don't even remember what the video was but i
01:06:54 remember someone made like a video about this drama such as it is and i went and i looked i actually
01:07:00 joined the twin perfect discord which i think i'm still in just to because i was curious what the
01:07:05 people on their side of the table were saying i mean it should be noted twin perfect absolutely
01:07:10 went hard against tom hewlett yeah and ascribed much like uh a lot of i wouldn't say malice but a
01:07:17 lot of mistakes they put at his feet yeah they according to them he was like very uh he was
01:07:23 like very well they describe him as kind of having a fairly high like executive like like
01:07:29 directorial role in it and being the decision maker behind a lot of the things that they didn't
01:07:35 like about the direction the series took indeed that they say that like you know he doesn't understand
01:07:40 the lore he doesn't understand the appeal of the series he fundamentally misunderstands the the stuff
01:07:45 and so on this particular drama was interesting because there there is there was a very explicit
01:07:51 point if you watch the whole series which i have many times they there is an episode where they say
01:07:56 like who is to blame who is to blame and they quite this is years before the drama came out
01:08:02 and they're like if you watch this is like part 15 or something but you know such as it is
01:08:06 and they were like who's to blame tom hewlett bears responsibility but the main man who is
01:08:11 responsible for the downfall of silent hill is akiri yamaoka akiri yamaoka is the guy who's
01:08:17 done the music i believe for all the silent hill games and he at some point was put in charge of
01:08:21 the series and he he like they say this is the man who really did it to silent hill we love what he
01:08:27 did in the past because these guys these guys the hard like one two three four are great beyond that
01:08:32 shit you know they get them i mean they get criticism for going too hard on tom hewlett like
01:08:36 even as the series was coming out because there is like at the beginning of one video they they
01:08:40 respond to a question it's like it's not all tom's hewlett's fault and they say like we didn't say it
01:08:44 was all tom's hewlett's fault and then they give a bunch of like it's like you know a lot of this
01:08:49 they talk about other people's involvement and decision they do talk a lot about tom hewlett
01:08:53 though the abs okay but which i'm not saying they shouldn't do necessarily uh yeah i mean i i a
01:08:59 little bit feel like people are being a little bit i don't know like should they i agree they
01:09:06 probably exaggerated some things but like clearly these are like passionate nerdy fans or like obsessed
01:09:11 with the shit and you know they're looking to place blame on someone tom hewlett's obviously at
01:09:15 least partially responsible was it totally fair to put it on him probably not i i don't know it's
01:09:21 like fans get a little bit carried away sometimes with their excessive if they were to do it again
01:09:26 they'd probably be a little bit less it's all on this guy but there is some responsibility yeah i
01:09:31 don't know i don't necessarily it's like what's the i don't think twin perfect like did anything
01:09:35 wrong exactly i mean they might have been i mean they may have been somewhat mistaken in like
01:09:42 i mean like they might have thought that he did more than he did like they could be factually
01:09:47 you know i don't feel like they were in the wrong to criticize a guy for the things he did
01:09:55 in a video game it you know it did always strike me that even as i watched that series i thought to
01:10:01 myself like you know kodami is a very big presumably complex company yeah a lot of these guys say
01:10:07 that it's hard to maneuver in a big company they have to get approval from executives and like
01:10:12 how much can one man be responsible they say that in the at some they talk about how like you know
01:10:18 this is a like this is a corporate machine that is that is like you know that has set this up
01:10:25 you know so i mean i would just agree i would agree to his employers i think tom i think perfect
01:10:31 did in fact put yeah i i agree i think twin perfect did put too much responsibility on tom i agree
01:10:37 with that but i don't think they like we're deliberately trying to get the guy harassed
01:10:42 or nor do i like if we if we held like i don't think they expected the series to be that popular
01:10:47 it's like at what point you know it's it kind of come to that thing that that topic i talked about
01:10:52 months ago which was like what is it the journalistic concept of like not doing harm or whatever it is
01:10:58 like there is accountability for anyone who makes a youtube video to like be accurate and precise
01:11:03 that you're not like doing any negativity and i have no doubt tom got a good amount of yeah i mean
01:11:09 there's definitely a probably a large contingent of the silent hill fan base that now associates
01:11:14 tom hewlett as the guy who ruined silent hill sure the question to the interesting question
01:11:19 is a legitimate one is to ask like how much blame let's say tom at an absolutely terrible time as
01:11:23 a result of this these were a bunch of dudes making videos about silent hill how much responsibility
01:11:30 do they bear for simply yeah going perhaps a bit too hard on a man they feel is responsible for
01:11:36 a downturn of a video games i don't feel like more than zero less than i don't feel like you
01:11:41 can point to any like particular thing they said and say like this is unacceptable for you just for
01:11:48 you to say this no sir have you no sense of decency sir and you know i'll just say i always
01:11:56 found this a little bit funny they they did a thing i was always a little bit suspicious of this
01:12:01 where they say like here okay god it was after i think this criticisms like this began to come out
01:12:06 and they were having their fights with the sound hill wiki they're like okay guys new gimmick for
01:12:10 this episode we want you to smash the dislike button because um uh because we want to show them
01:12:17 that we hate it was like the remakes and i mean i agree there's tons of problems with the remakes
01:12:22 total very shitty product they go into incredible detail into all the problems and i salute them
01:12:26 for it but like the way they're saying like smash the dislike button it's like oh now like no one
01:12:33 can hold you accountable if there's any negativity to this video because if it's all positive you
01:12:38 can say wow even though we said it smashed the dislike button everybody loves us and if it's
01:12:43 tons of dislikes well you're just making that a positive now which i thought was a little bit
01:12:49 silly but i mean i get the point it's just uh an intro i was wondered if there's a little bit of
01:12:54 of gamesmanship going on there you know trying to cover themselves a little bit how you play the
01:13:01 game i suppose i suppose what yeah i mean you know they're they're these guys were going on a big
01:13:07 culture war of like we want to defend classic silent hill and that that raises innumerable
01:13:14 issues about you know it's it's the cult it's all about the cult it's not a it's oh yeah i don't
01:13:21 think we'll remember that it's a silent according to the lore of silent hill one this is all caused
01:13:25 by the cult and alessa was a sacrifice alessa was not a deliberate sacrifice the fire was started
01:13:30 accidentally i mean these i mean you know me i made my fucking like tifa video about retardedly
01:13:37 overly analyzing details that's all they do this is all they do it's a good series these are the
01:13:42 it's a really good it is a good series the twin perfect silent hills is really fucking oh the real
01:13:46 world dark world and foggy town they all the production values on these songs they roll out
01:13:52 like incredible the only one with another worldly name i think about that song all the time hard to
01:13:58 believe it's a great song it's a great song about such minute plot details one yeah just like who
01:14:05 would do such a thing it's great it's great yeah and i mean just if you watch the series like the
01:14:10 amount of editing and the hard work that is just so apparent in every part of the video i always
01:14:15 thought their delivery is pretty bad they really come off like they're stiff and like the way they
01:14:20 read their lines it's like it really feels like they're reading cue cards you really feel that
01:14:25 they're reading cue cards and like their jet they gesticulate a little too much i don't know uh we've
01:14:32 had this disagreement before i've always liked rosseter he's like he moves his head and shoulders
01:14:36 in a very like explaining way and like a by the way twin perfect not uploaded a video
01:14:44 since may 4th 2018 so it's been all like over a year and a half now and i miss you guys rosseter
01:14:50 please come back oh my god in my head i was thinking of dude perfect you dude perfect oh my god the
01:15:00 trick shot people uh yeah they do trick shots never they like they do trick shots wait what where
01:15:05 you throw you know like you throw a ball into onto the wall and it lands in a cup and then
01:15:10 they go like oh my god my guess i don't know this my guess is that they're the most profitable
01:15:15 youtube channel in the world that is my guess dude perfect because dude perfect yes i mean they get
01:15:21 insane numbers and what they do is not i mean i respect the work they put in they make props and
01:15:27 they do crazy tricks but we all know they just practice the trip over and over until it works
01:15:31 you like um like the jackie chan thing you seen that uh you seen that yes yeah that every frame
01:15:37 every frame painting with jackie chan now he would just do like hundreds of takes until he got the
01:15:41 shot or the hit or the perfect or broke his leg and i respect it oh yeah or or dies in trying
01:15:49 um well okay that's enough about dude perfect uh that's enough about twin perfect all right here
01:15:55 i got i got something to say about uh a content creator um you know andrew hussey that guy who
01:16:02 made homestuck and so mother things i've heard of him i've heard the name but i've never met the man
01:16:07 but beyond that uh he has opened an instagram account semi recently um and he is a hashtag
01:16:17 eboy now um for his for his 40th birthday i think it was he started being an eboy
01:16:23 tell me more he started to being he started being an eboy on instagram and i followed him
01:16:28 and the the the the posts initially were just like him wearing like extremely young people
01:16:35 hip trendy clothing okay um with sunglasses doing silly poses in front of horses in you know in a
01:16:42 place yeah uh then it was like a bunch of images from him like in a different swag outfit fresh as
01:16:48 fuck you know all that sort of you know and he's just sort of hashtag eboy hashtag hussey like like
01:16:54 is like in places being fresh and it's it's funny it's just it's unironically the best thing he's
01:17:01 made since uh like i don't know cascade yeah so um but then uh like more recently than he started
01:17:12 making these these posts he's been like doing Toblerone hot drops uh they're not hot drops but
01:17:18 like Toblerone secret location find the Toblerone quests he would he would take picture of Toblerone
01:17:26 he would sign them and he would hide them in a place he would take a few pictures of himself
01:17:31 and then like a zoom in on a google map and people would go out and find the Toblerone
01:17:37 and uh this most recent one he was in taiwan i think according to comments so he's in taiwan
01:17:46 put in Toblerone and it was just so funny he he took a picture of the Toblerone
01:17:52 and then he took a picture of a shop and then he took a picture of the bathroom stall of the shop
01:17:57 and then of a painting on the wall so presumably he just shoved a bunch of Toblerone with his name
01:18:02 on it in this in in this bathroom stall uh painting for people to go and find and um the
01:18:11 the last time the first time somebody found the Toblerone the Toblerone uh you know secret quest
01:18:19 thing uh they he said he'll make something canon they want to be canon oh and they said june egg
01:18:26 Bert just generally i guess in homestuck was yeah and and then they said uh make june egg
01:18:32 Bert canon and he said yeah sure june egg Bert is like uh john eggbert but trans cool so like
01:18:41 that's all right so so people went nuts like oh my god june is john just trans now is that what
01:18:47 happened or no i mean it's just it's just a bit of fun like it's not like he hasn't written anything
01:18:52 it's just sort of like yeah sure that's canon and everyone's like yeah and i i just really like this
01:19:00 like so much of like what has followed from homestuck at the decline of homestuck in x6 and
01:19:07 then everything that's followed has been like kind of depressing but i like the fact that
01:19:11 hussey himself is still funny that is cool that is that he's that he's doing this e-boy stuff i'm
01:19:17 gonna i'm gonna link his instagram i just want to see what kind of fresh outfits he's wearing
01:19:22 yeah me too i want to be like i want to be like that i want to be a fresh e-boy
01:19:28 this is disgusting by the way and i don't approve of this this is an old man he used to get into
01:19:33 his coffin and stay there no his name is e-boy hussey instagram.com
01:19:41 e-boy hussey uh fashion girl he looks pretty good for his body he's got the sports yeah he looks
01:19:47 pretty good for his body yeah i i think it was 40 i i mean i heard that's a word i don't actually
01:19:52 know that sounds about right because he's like yeah he's elderly he's about that he's he's uh he's
01:19:59 basically late 30s oh him his his fucking emo striped uh some of these are almost unironically
01:20:06 good or like you would see yeah like people people were like laughing at first but then a few people
01:20:10 like damn oh no my my erotic senses all the one with like with the wings behind yeah exactly that's
01:20:18 the one i was thinking of in in boston there is a an alley near harvard's you're in harvard square
01:20:24 and in this alley on the wall are these pair of like big white wings and uh everybody every
01:20:29 fucking thought or whatever every every femoids gotta have their uh you know their picture of them
01:20:35 in front of those wings and these wings okay not only is that like a really uninspired uh picture
01:20:42 to take like every obviously everybody does that like there but they also suck for like one they're
01:20:49 at the wrong height like they look like they're coming out of your like hips so they're okay they're
01:20:54 too low they're not positioned correctly more importantly they're just bad like they're just
01:20:58 badly painted like the wings are not the same size like one is just longer than the other and
01:21:04 like they're completely lopsided it's like bad execution of a bad idea and uh i hate everything
01:21:11 perspective they look good no no no they're just no no okay no they're they're just they're just
01:21:16 like a fucking hack put them there and nobody had any better ideas so they've just been there
01:21:21 presumably since the dawn of time ain't that just the way it goes but it's a it's an institution
01:21:27 now on boston area social media you gotta see those fucking wings everywhere it's like
01:21:34 the london bridge exactly just gotta blow it up you take a you go to france you take a picture
01:21:38 in front of the eiffel tower you go to boston you get your stupid fucking alley wall wings
01:21:45 how embarrassing for us as a species yeah but of course i see hussy here in front of his cool
01:21:51 like big like tropical parrot wings and he's he's making it work he's dressed for the occasion yeah
01:21:57 i love the little chain he has on he should have a turtleneck really but uh i appreciate the

01:29:00 shit oh i see so you gotta you gotta do something about it i just i can i can barely hear you i don't
01:29:07 know but that goes for everybody i'm interested oh okay there was another note so some of these
01:29:12 were too long so this is my little summary section okay never paint heard last episode where i was like
01:29:18 inktober sounds like the never paint lifestyle and go never paint and so never paint left a voicemail
01:29:24 it was fairly long of just being like oh no i actually haven't been doing inktober and i feel
01:29:30 guilty now that's okay fucking tober i went and i checked i believe never paint has in the
01:29:35 style so the voicemail was like i won't sleep i will finish inktober now because i've been told to
01:29:40 you don't need to do that i absolve you of any need to do this because they were very clear she or he
01:29:45 was like i am busy with other things that's why i'm not doing inktober you don't need to do inktober
01:29:50 i don't want to put any pressure on you dog you're working hard already it's clear i'm not so but
01:29:55 but alas alas they had already caught up and clearly had been burning the midnight oil to do this so
01:30:02 i just want to absolve you with whatever little authority i have here since i was the one who
01:30:07 said go go inktober never paint man so okay there you go month tober i'm i'm like two days behind
01:30:14 but i'm gonna do two little drawings today also did by the way check out red noir i just posted a
01:30:19 new page oh yeah that's good stuff i love red noir dude i love red noir it's really great was that
01:30:26 was that smear glass chapter no it's um what's the name of the shraft shraft that's the one that's the
01:30:30 one shraft and gurren by uh yeah yeah please please continue red noir uh give i i forget what's the
01:30:39 name of your of your slime lady who can't speak correctly uh katie katie yes i like katie want
01:30:46 more more draw pornography everyone please you've been destroyed uh okay last last thing i want to
01:30:54 say of these voicemails that were too long or boring to play which is so a mysterious man who
01:30:59 actually we have a voicemail of his but i like i don't know his name i don't know what he really is
01:31:04 there's a guy who's been leaving many voicemails and they're not bad and apparently so on my stream
01:31:10 yesterday he just said like he was like hey nate if someone gets five voicemails on a piece of
01:31:15 episode do they become god and i'm like impossible but if they did yes and apparently this guy has
01:31:21 in fact done that as of last episode so go listen to the last episode apparently five of those were
01:31:27 from one dude i'm a little incredulous though if that's actually true and this person provided no
01:31:33 proof so i'm just saying call it with a better voicemail and prove it does he assume that it was
01:31:39 like of all time like over time no i mean they said like last bcp episode that we played apparently
01:31:45 five of their voicemails was the was the claim here so i mean i find that's it's hard to believe
01:31:51 so okay there's just an opposite prove it is my point i don't believe you um okay with that
01:31:57 enough of the announcements let's get on to the actual voicemails here we go so first one is from
01:32:02 our old friend scumbag chris uh let's see what they have to say for themselves go it's been four
01:32:08 weeks since i left home to become part of a group of you social insects unfortunately the kamikaze
01:32:13 ants wouldn't let me join them since i was too much of a weeb even for them so i've had to scrap
01:32:17 my plan to suicide bomb the pcphq fortunately my many years spent studying the blade made me an
01:32:23 excellent candidate for the leaf cutters and i really did want to see what all the hype for ant
01:32:27 fungus mutualism was about at first they were hesitant to accept a guy who's 185 centimeters
01:32:32 tall and a bipedal mammal but i think they're starting to warm up to me all it really took
01:32:37 was for me to make my intentions clear that i was mainly just there for that sick ass ant pussy
01:32:42 and i landed a job as an apprentice drone so being a leaf cutter ants pretty neat all day it's just
01:32:47 walk to the forest cut some plants bring the pieces back to the nest and feed them to the fungus
01:32:52 i'm surprised by how much the repetitive menial physical labor distracts me from the systemic
01:32:56 inequality of this militant classist regime but more than that it's the fact that i get to smash
01:33:01 that sick ass ant queen pussy for real the queen cast exists to take cock especially in a colony
01:33:07 with no gamer gates and she doesn't even give a shit how laughably minuscule my micro penis is
01:33:11 compared to the other drones ants don't give a fuck okay there you go i good story they sure get
01:33:19 a sure as a i feel i can't wait to see here where this goes i get it too yeah scum bag chris
01:33:25 hey hey tell us more hey mage i see a i see a little i saw something pop up on my little
01:33:31 vapor suit kickstarter backer report there yeah i saw you it can't be true it could yeah some somebody
01:33:38 is somebody somebody pledged to my kickstarter mage who could that be thank you thank you she's
01:33:46 just trying to help an honest sly moid get an education i wanted to pledge earlier but i was
01:33:51 saying well for that switch so i wasn't sure if i had some to spare but i did the money's not for
01:33:56 you ben it's for the sly moid it is i've told uh christine that all proceeds are going to uh the
01:34:02 new lost angel city aka new milwaukee emergency rain relief fund so uh that 300 dollars education that
01:34:09 300 dollars is just off the table you know they needed they needed more than me you know that that
01:34:14 that favorable exchange rate we got to make it work while we still can slime will become the next
01:34:19 president yeah mage have you ever played a game called forager by any chance oh hold on i'm gonna
01:34:24 go but it sounds familiar it's it's it's one of these monotonous grindy games where you start off
01:34:29 with like no tools on an island no i haven't i looked at looked into it and like it seems like
01:34:35 something i would like but at the same time there's things i would not like about it so no i didn't
01:34:40 try it the so i first read about this game from um uh what's his name what's discount
01:34:45 matthew matthew matthew matthew's his name oh andrew dobbson joseph anderson joseph anderson
01:34:49 Yeah, I still never watched Noah, but yeah, Joseph Anderson, he made his travel logs.
01:34:56 I have I never watched him one day. I should check him out. But Joseph Anderson made a video
01:35:01 about forager. I found it interesting. So I went and I got it. And it that game is like
01:35:06 it's probably the most addictive game I've ever played. It's similar to cookie clicker,
01:35:09 but as a better gameplay loop such that like, there's a point where you hit like the curve
01:35:14 where you it takes a while to like increase and expand and do other stuff after you've
01:35:17 like bought all the land. And I've hit that. And then I just wiped my game and replayed
01:35:23 it up to that point, like three times, because it's just addictive. And oh, my, my famous
01:35:28 me a math of a two video, I have no time and I must game is about the addiction to this
01:35:34 to this very game. But okay, nonetheless, so it's fun, but it's a total waste of time.
01:35:40 It's just a satisfying gameplay loop is the only is the only good thing about it. It
01:35:46 is satisfying. Okay, next voicemail. I'm scared actually to play. I mean, it's not worth
01:35:50 your money. I don't play it. It's literally when I when I make fun of people who play
01:35:55 games and games as a complete time sink, this is the epitome of the time sink with like
01:36:00 in the same way as cookie clicker or monster clicker, any of those derivative games. Okay,
01:36:05 whatever. Anyway, next voicemail, this is from it was an inside job. Okay, go. Hi PCP.
01:36:13 I've got a question. As a content creator, what do you think is the right strategy to
01:36:19 incorporate? Patreon, should you have it from the beginning and as your audience grows,
01:36:25 you grow to, or should you wait till your audience grows and then introduce it once
01:36:30 you've kind of developed a following? Thanks. I think what do you think that the best way
01:36:36 to do it wait until and this is cynical and I didn't do this, but I wish I had I wish
01:36:43 I had had wait, you know, grow an audience. First, don't have it from the beginning.
01:36:50 Wait until something bad happens to you and then announce that you started a Patreon because
01:36:55 something bad happened to you. But Ben, what if nothing bad happens then you're fucked.
01:37:03 Pray for tragedy and strike. You can have it and if you just don't talk about it that much and
01:37:09 then bring it up when a bad thing happens to you, then that could also work. Yeah, that's true.
01:37:14 I think in terms of like, like actual strategy, if you're going into like making a career in the
01:37:21 internet stuff, probably on YouTube, I'm assuming, then you want to like gain a following first and
01:37:30 then announce it when it's you're pretty big. You want to be like at the peak when it's like
01:37:34 you're you've made your best video yet and loads of people love you and then say, hey guys,
01:37:39 if you want to support me because like if you leave the ability for people to support you off
01:37:45 the table, they the yearning grows strong and people who would support you are more likely to
01:37:52 support more. It seems to be from what I've seen from from the the small amount of cases where
01:37:59 this has happened, where a channel has gotten incredibly like good vibes from the from, you
01:38:06 know, their fan base, they got loads of subscribers, they got, you know, pretty solid niche. And then
01:38:11 they announced their Patreon as just sort of like a thing. They don't even need to do much
01:38:15 marketing about it. They just need to mention it. And then those people will jump on it.
01:38:19 It seems seems to work in that in that order. It's kind of a complicated question. I think it
01:38:25 I think there is another thing. If somebody if somebody is very small, they don't have a lot
01:38:31 of subscribers and have a lot of stuff, and they have a Patreon link and they say at the end of
01:38:35 every video, I habitually will go and click on that link to see how pathetic they are. And if
01:38:42 they're extremely pathetic, I'm going to be like, right. And I don't really need to do that. It's
01:38:49 not like I was planning to pledge to them if they had a lot of money already. It's just sort of a
01:38:54 thing I do. And it's a it's another way people can speak. It's all about marketing. It's all
01:38:57 optics, right? Like that's the entire game. And if you you don't, you if you're small, you don't
01:39:04 want to advertise that you're small. And the worst thing you can do is just be starting out and
01:39:07 having a Patreon with zero dollars, because it just reinforces the fact that you don't have any
01:39:12 cloud. And that's a bad look. So you just don't want you don't because also, if you have like
01:39:19 that one person who's interested, and they click on your Patreon, and there's nothing,
01:39:24 that's the absence of social proof and will disincentivize them from wanting to actually
01:39:28 support you. So sad, but true. What you want to do is you want to wait until you have people
01:39:33 starving to actually support you anyway. Like you should wait till at least you have 1000
01:39:38 followers subscribers, like a big enough volume that like when you say I have
01:39:42 a Patreon, you'll get like five to 10 people do it immediately. And then the barrier is broken
01:39:47 and it's all up from there. I don't disagree with that. I just like
01:39:52 if we're talking about like small ish amounts of money, I mean by that, by that I just mean
01:39:56 like anything like under, I don't know, like 500 bucks or like under like 1000 dollars. Like I
01:40:01 guess I'm just wondering like who, what's the intention of this? Because like if your intention
01:40:06 is to like make this a job, I would say that like it doesn't matter, because no matter when you make
01:40:12 it, you're not going to make enough to live on until you're like significantly popular.
01:40:17 Like more popular than like me at this very time. You need to be like a big boy marketing. Like if
01:40:22 you're if you're trying to do it as a job and you're not making any money, like you're probably
01:40:27 working a day job anyway. You don't you don't have to make enough to be like a middle class
01:40:33 income for Patreon to be worth having. No, but I mean that's why that's why like the question
01:40:41 it kind of depends, because if you're if you're trying to like live off of it exclusively,
01:40:45 then I would say the answer is it doesn't really matter, because you have to get
01:40:49 we're talking about ways to maximize how much money you'll get.
01:40:53 It's the idea is the idea is that when you're growing during that period, if you have a Patreon
01:41:02 at maximum, you'll have like a few patrons. And later you will have more patrons because
01:41:08 your audience will be bigger. But right, it's sort of like an explosion that happens. If you
01:41:14 start if you open the Patreon, it's like when you're big, you get more than if you had been
01:41:20 gradually accumulating them because of the marketing thing. Yeah, I mean, I suppose.
01:41:24 But then I firmly believe that's true. It's not always like a terrible thing. Like the the
01:41:31 podcast, we're not huge. Right. And we have our Patreon. I mean, people do know us from other
01:41:37 things that definitely plays a part. But we can get like a couple thousand to like 10,000 views
01:41:44 on a video. Yeah, pretty, you know, in that range, it falls to you know, depending on how
01:41:49 hype the chapter is, it goes up and down. Indeed, indeed. But like, that's a significant audience
01:41:54 that is consistent. You know, it's not like we're getting like 10 to 100 views per video.
01:41:59 We're actually we have like a fan base in that way. So like having the Patreon at that point is
01:42:06 you don't need to be having hundreds of thousands before you start. You just need to have
01:42:10 some sort of audience that is, you know, not like incidental. I think it's not a number.
01:42:16 I honestly do. Yeah. I mean, because like the problem is like it's all this is all about
01:42:19 social proof. And it's all about like, before you can have it be like, this is worth paying for,
01:42:26 you have to approve it's worth watching. You know, that's the first goal. So like getting a
01:42:30 consistent view count and getting getting people to come back. That's the step one. Then you can
01:42:35 focus on monetizing it. Because you already have people you've already you've proven that it works,
01:42:40 right? Because like monetizing something that isn't proven in this kind of like method where
01:42:48 you're writing on cloud and you're writing on basically like forming a cult, that's what Patreon
01:42:53 is, you make a cult essentially, like there has to be like actual interest there. So if you well,
01:42:59 what if you're making content that's really good? I know some people like this, you're making great
01:43:03 content that you believe in, you just feel undiscovered, but like you're getting very low
01:43:08 views like sub like 50 views, right? You know, that's, we're not talking about quality, we're
01:43:13 talking about social proof. There's, but it's all it all matters. But there are tons of great people
01:43:18 out there who make incredibly good content that nobody cares about. This is about being cared
01:43:22 about. This is not about making something good. They're two separate things. I mean, but we're
01:43:25 just, we're talking about like maximizing and I agree, it could match, but like, we're at such
01:43:31 low percentage at like the very start of the career that I really wonder how like, is that $5
01:43:37 that you might win or lose at the very beginning of your career really makes such a big difference
01:43:41 when we all know what actually makes a difference at the end? Why are you, why are you arguing our
01:43:46 point as though you're disagreeing? Because I think I do? I don't know. The point is to wait
01:43:53 until you get at least a thousand subscribers or something to that effect before you open a Patreon.
01:43:59 Don't start it from the beginning. Well, wait until you have an audience,
01:44:02 wait until the moment when you can ride a wave of goodwill, whether you release like a really big
01:44:07 project that gets a really good reception that you think will, or like I said, if like, oh, YouTube,
01:44:13 I got YouTube struck, I got demonetized, my videos get demonetized, my last video got taken down
01:44:17 because trolls, trolls reported and it got demonetized or something. I've been victimized,
01:44:22 now's the time, whatever, we don't know. I know that's cynical, but I've seen it work.
01:44:28 You know, something that will give you a wave of like community goodwill
01:44:32 that you can coincide with and I've released a Patreon and that's how you do it. That's how you
01:44:38 maximize your return. I just don't see that much difference between saying I just created my Patreon
01:44:43 in this moment and here is my existing Patreon. Well, no, that's true. I guess. But I guess it's
01:44:51 okay, you can make it whenever you want. Don't push it until you have an audience.
01:44:57 I suppose. If you're putting your Patreon in front of people's eyes and you have like
01:45:03 one patron and it's your mom, then it's like, yeah. It's the same thing like when you go to Amazon
01:45:10 and you see a product that has like no reviews, like you're just put off by even like purchasing
01:45:17 it because like there's no social proof. The social proof there matters because there's a
01:45:20 quantifiable metric that you expect in that format. So if you go to Patreon and you see zero
01:45:24 patrons and this is a small creator, you're just, there's no social proof. So your monkey brain
01:45:30 naturally assumes that this is bad or not worth my money. And even if you were going in there with
01:45:34 the intention of giving a dollar, seeing the zero, seeing nothing makes you feel less inclined to do
01:45:41 so because we're herd creatures and the fact that no one else has done it makes you feel less
01:45:45 likely to do it. It's all about marketing and branding and optics. Do not start until you have
01:45:50 an audience. Period. Yeah. You know, I agree. I realize the only way that I feel differently is
01:45:56 because because we're talking about such beginning of career situations here, I feel like I just
01:46:01 wouldn't want to encourage people to put off a job to later that they could do today. I have seen
01:46:06 people like too hesitant to start. Like Nightmare Masterclass didn't start a Patreon for a long
01:46:13 time, even though he had like, you know, like his Petscop investigation series was getting a lot of,
01:46:19 but it wasn't until like that, it wasn't until that series, like even though it was popular and
01:46:24 getting viewed and people loved it, he didn't start a Patreon until like well after it was over.
01:46:29 And I think he was just like, oh, I'm not big enough yet. I'm not big enough yet. It's like,
01:46:32 no, he was definitely big enough at that point. He could have been doing it. My fucking boy,
01:46:37 limit breakers, like my current like favorite YouTuber, just like these crazy insane Dark Souls
01:46:41 edits and they're like the best videos on the platform. He like just made a Patreon at like,
01:46:47 he had like 274,000 subscribers. That's way too late. Don't wait that long. I guess he just decided
01:46:52 now is the time to get money, I guess. This will be good to have. Yeah, and it's kind of a shame
01:46:58 because it's like Dark Souls 3. I mean, I don't know whether he does Sakura videos. He's done
01:47:02 some here and there. Like all of the videos that he's like, the game's really old now. Yeah. Yeah.
01:47:09 I mean, hopefully Elden Ring. I mean, this guy, he's insane. He will succeed at whatever he tries to
01:47:14 do. He's just that good. I love him so much, but it's Elden Ring, right? Yeah. That's right. That's
01:47:19 right. Did you hear that George RR Martin is writing for it? Yeah. He's doing all the work.
01:47:24 Okay. I don't know if I got, okay, whatever. My friend told me that and it blew my fucking mind.
01:47:29 It is interesting. It's gonna be pretty legit, hopefully. Yeah, that's really cool. We'll have
01:47:33 to see. We'll have to see. Okay. I hope there's dialogue that I like. There's always been dialogue
01:47:38 I like. Okay. Next voicemail. Get ready for this because this is the Tom Oliver secret agenda.
01:47:45 Looking forward to hearing that. All right. Here we go. Man, I kind of just wanted to
01:47:48 fuck Western society and the ass bitch. That's it. That's it. Wait, and the what bitch? I think he said
01:47:56 I wanted to fuck Western society in the ass bitch. I believe was the full phrase there. Tom, what do
01:48:04 you have to say? Okay. Sounds like something I can kill a first Friday night doing. Let's make it
01:48:11 happen. Western society, call in with your response, please. Yeah, let us know. Oh, speaking of
01:48:20 responses. Okay, good news, guys. As we requested, as a response to the grammar, was it the grammar
01:48:26 Nazi, the grammar fascist, grammar Antifa is calling in with response. So let's see what grammar
01:48:33 Antifa has to say in rebuttal. Okay, go. Hello, it's me, grammar Antifa. I buy books about slaves so
01:48:38 I can burn them and set history free. I'm calling in to address the political enemy, the grammar
01:48:43 fascist, who appeared in last week's episode. What grammar fascism fails to understand about
01:48:47 communication is that it is a dance. An improvisational duet, the code's meaning through
01:48:51 language. Unlike real dance, however, if there is not an understanding, both parties are at fault.
01:48:56 You take an idea, you encode that idea, the second party receives the coded language and then
01:48:59 decrypts it back into an idea. If the second party's idea is too different from the intent,
01:49:04 both the encryptor and the decryptor failed in communication. The encryptor did not make their
01:49:08 message simple and clear enough and the decryptor failed to extrapolate true meaning due to
01:49:12 ignorance. Those who are good at communication are good at both standardized rule sets need not
01:49:16 apply. Fact of the matter is that if true meaning is found to communication was a success. The sheer
01:49:20 fact they were able to tell they had fucked up means that there was no miscommunication about
01:49:24 what they were saying. English is controlled by the people and how they use it naturally evolves
01:49:27 over time. Rule set doesn't fucking matter. Address miscommunications directly. Instead of
01:49:32 being caught up in pedantic semantics, I imagine plague you on a daily basis. I can only assume
01:49:36 you're getting pissy with your far more chad-minded friends talking casually in a discord or some
01:49:41 shit. They're writing messages exclusively for the friend group and no one on the outside.
01:49:45 Shut the fuck up, piss boy. The dictionary is a guideline. Your high school English teacher
01:49:49 is a hack and the soy-guzzling skinhead language prescriptivist just got yeeted on by the
01:49:53 Zoomer cacophony that is language descriptivism. Vote single person pronoun they as word of the
01:49:58 year, hashtag dabble my haters, and dating white is not all right. Grammar Antifa signing out.
01:50:05 Thank you, Grammar Antifa. Well, I love this person, and I would say that they're completely
01:50:12 right. You mispronounced cacophony, so every point you made is in there. I'm sorry. I can't
01:50:21 understand what you mean because you mispronounced cacophony. You failed to your half of the dance,
01:50:26 Grammar Antifa. How did they pronounce cacophony? They said cacophony. They said caca- fucking
01:50:31 digi-style cacophony. Was that supposed to be a digi-reference, or was that legit fuck up? No,
01:50:35 no, no. That's a super bunny hop reference. Oh, yeah, that's right. Actually, do you think that was
01:50:40 actually a reference, like, deliberate? No, no. I kind of think so, but I don't know. I mean,
01:50:46 like, super bunny hop may said cacophony in one of his videos, like, straight face, he didn't
01:50:53 realize, and then he got so much shit for it that every time there's a word that he could
01:50:57 potentially mispronounce, he does, he has a robot say it, and that's like a running thing in his
01:51:02 videos now. That's a good bit though. I like, I like, no, this, do you guys agree with this? I
01:51:08 agree with this. It is a failure of communication. I mean, I think I would say that the burden is
01:51:14 probably more on the person speaking to make their message understood. I don't know if I'd say the
01:51:18 blame is 50-50. I think that like, the message here is correct, but I think all the rules and
01:51:25 structures are serving to make the speaker and the recipient's job easier by having a standardized
01:51:32 set of rules that you stick to, so you don't have to spend as much time encrypting or decrypting
01:51:37 the message. That's the whole point of grammar rules in the first place. You're right. I think it's
01:51:41 an interesting point that the fact that you can comment on the, on the quote-unquote mistake
01:51:49 means that there was no failure, that you do know what they meant. I think that's an interesting
01:51:54 idea to point out. It's probably true to some extent. Like the fact that you can be like,
01:52:01 you know, obviously you meant T-H-E-Y, apostrophe-R-E means you do know what they meant.
01:52:09 So fuck, yeah, that's a good point. But here's the bad news though. In anticipation of Antifa
01:52:16 calling in, we have another voicemail from this person is known as grammar, a white
01:52:23 identitarian with nationalist traits. Let's, let's see what this individual has to say.
01:52:29 All right, go. All right, Nate said someone should send in a bash the grammar bash. However,
01:52:36 I am here in having anticipated that to respond to the bash the grammar bash with my rehash the
01:52:44 grammar bash. Listen, it's just really annoying when people put like use the wrong form of your
01:52:51 or there. It's just annoying. We don't need to justify it. It just puts like two seconds in
01:52:58 effort and just rub your fucking brains together and figure it out. Just, just don't be a fucking
01:53:05 war on phones. As always, a stellar point from the far right. That's pretty convincing. Yeah.
01:53:16 He used, he used simple vernacular and I understood his message. So, you know, he's got a point.
01:53:22 I think he succeeded at communicating better than grammar and use too many big words.
01:53:28 It scares me and intimidates me. I like that. I do like big words. I feel smart when I understand
01:53:33 them like cacophony. The debate rages on. I may I'm a grammar centrist. Damn, that's a big brain
01:53:43 position. I'm a grandma. All right, next one. We've got another update from a not even cluster
01:53:50 punk can save me now. Let's let's check in with him. Go. Shit. Shit. I've been on the run for the
01:53:56 last seven days straight. There's not much time. I didn't have time to leave you guys a warning
01:54:00 last week. The PC police were hacking me when I leaked your search histories. So now they have
01:54:04 all your locations. There's no time before they make a move. They're going to be. Wait, no. No, no,
01:54:10 no, I'm not going back. You'll never take me alive. No, no, no.
01:54:17 Is this thing on? Well, it is. Welcome, PCP members. This is the PC police.
01:54:26 I am one of the four elite generals in charge of taking down your operation.
01:54:31 Our first target will be the man we've deduced to most likely be the leader best guy ever.
01:54:38 No, it's digi. It's digi.
01:54:44 This is Dachshund.
01:55:01 Early intervention can make a lifetime of difference. Learn the signs at autismspeaks.org.
01:55:09 Next time, we'll be talking about Ghost in the Shell standalone complex, the best anime ever.
01:55:22 How embarrassing. How did we get here? What a journey.
01:55:29 It just kept going. Maybe that was the true attack by the PC police.
01:55:33 Yeah, me too. I think that was the true attack by the PC police to shame me for my
01:55:38 continued delays on certain projects. That was their assault. I don't want them after me. I'm
01:55:44 glad they think you're the leader. That had about as much effect as a Kersjehame Ha on my
01:55:50 soul over here. I'll try to recover. There's only one Polish guy. Once they got you either done,
01:55:58 they don't need to go after anyone else. Any other guys? Don't worry about it. Yes.
01:56:04 Although Poland and Lithuania. It's all his fault.
01:56:10 All right. Next one, we've got PC Pi is calling in.
01:56:18 What does PCP stand for? Well, I'll tell you. It stands for professional
01:56:26 subit peruiners because you ruined my fucking bit. All right, let's try this again.
01:56:32 Everybody come to a consensus and pick a whole number between one and 244. Thanks.
01:56:45 Is there any way we can fuck him over again? Like a whole number?
01:56:48 Is a fraction a whole number? Is a fraction a whole number?
01:56:54 How about 144? Is he still like 144? Sure. Yeah, that was the runner up last time.
01:57:02 That was the runner up. Mage said 66, but that's two Star Wars referencing for me.
01:57:10 Okay. Gib, Tom, what do you like? 144. I'm trying to think of
01:57:15 relevant numbers that are cool in between 0 and 244. I don't think there is one. I think all
01:57:22 the numbers between 0 and 244 are lame. In between 244. What about 151 in homage for the original?
01:57:34 Wait, wait, wait. 119, 119. 119. That's fine. That's 9-11 in UK dates.
01:57:42 Are we in agreement? 119, 119. Good. Sure. That's fine. All right, done. There it is.
01:57:49 There's your answer. 119, PC Pie, or whatever you were called last time. There's your answer.
01:57:54 Okay, good. Moving on, we got... We don't know. I don't know. He's going to add 10 to it,
01:58:01 and then he's going to divide it by three, and then he's going to say fuck you.
01:58:05 Is this your number? And we'll say how do you get... Wow, you got the same number back after
01:58:10 an operation designed to do that. Fascinating. Well, tell us, I can't wait to be dazzled.
01:58:17 But in the meantime, calling in is The Spirit of Halloween, which is perfect timing,
01:58:21 because we could use some of that. All right, let's hear you have to say. Go.
01:58:24 Go back to Grinch Night.
01:58:26 October's the season where all breathings emerge just to bring joy and horror to people's hearts.
01:58:32 I'm the spirit of Halloween. I encourage you to go out and complete this Halloween bucket list.
01:58:38 Kara Pumpkin, Data Witch, Give Pumpkin Spice Latte, Performance Seance,
01:58:44 Watch Soulweeder, Do Graffiti, Read Edgar Allan Poe, Kill a Man, Attend Costume Party,
01:58:50 Wear a Blackface, Go Trick or Treating, and Eat Lots of Candy. I've been the spirit of Halloween.
01:58:56 There you go, everybody. Really? Really, that made the cut?
01:58:58 It's your full bucket list. It wasn't great, but it was seasonal.
01:59:02 I told you to be picky this week.
01:59:04 It was seasonal. I loved the season. It was August in Halloween.
01:59:09 The only season here is the spice latte.
01:59:11 We do not endorse any of the views of the spirit of Halloween.
01:59:16 No, definitely not.
01:59:17 So just clarifying. Just clarifying that.
01:59:19 Quite the opposite.
01:59:19 This shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that Halloween season.
01:59:22 Yeah, thanks for proving my point, Mr. Spirit, sir.
01:59:26 This one, okay, this one's short. I can't remember what this is. It's a PC promise.
01:59:30 Oh, wait, I think I remember. Okay, it's a PC promise play.
01:59:33 Listen here, you fox. Vote Andrew Yang.
01:59:38 I will pledge 100 a month to your fucking Patreon.
01:59:43 Thank you.
01:59:43 Wait.
01:59:44 Well, okay, so right there. Ben, you are already possibly going to vote for Yang.
01:59:48 No.
01:59:48 If you just do that, I think he'll just give us $100 on the Patreon.
01:59:54 I'll vote for Andrew Yang.
01:59:56 You can give $100 to my Patreon, because I'll actually do it.
02:00:02 Here's all vote for Yang.
02:00:04 Is this illegal, by the way? Is it illegal to sell your vote?
02:00:06 I'm pretty sure it's illegal to sell your vote, but I'll do it.
02:00:09 But let's do it anyway.
02:00:11 I would do it if I thought I would actually get $100 or even my proportional fraction of $100.
02:00:17 This is just a coincidental exclusive exchange.
02:00:22 It has nothing to do with paying for the vote.
02:00:25 Right, totally unrelated.
02:00:26 Here's the thing. Here's the thing about buying votes.
02:00:30 When you're in the booth, nobody can know what you're doing.
02:00:34 So you could take the money and just not vote the way they want you to.
02:00:37 Yeah.
02:00:37 I guess they'll break your legs if they lose or something.
02:00:40 Maybe.
02:00:40 If they lose.
02:00:40 Yeah, well, this guy listens to the PCP.
02:00:43 I don't think there's going to be a problem.
02:00:45 Damn.
02:00:46 He sounds like he's 90 pounds soaking wet, if you know what I'm saying.
02:00:49 If I thought that I stood to gain, I don't know,
02:00:52 whatever fraction of that $100 would end up going to be.
02:00:54 10 bucks, maybe.
02:00:54 I don't know.
02:00:55 Yeah, 10 or 20 or whatever.
02:00:57 If I thought I would do it, I would sell my vote.
02:01:00 Right, because my vote is individually weak.
02:01:02 It's not yet.
02:01:04 But I don't think I'll get it.
02:01:07 I'm calling this bluff.
02:01:09 No.
02:01:09 You won't do it.
02:01:10 Don't say that.
02:01:10 It's a scam.
02:01:11 It's a sham.
02:01:12 And I'm a Bernie guy.
02:01:15 It's a scam.
02:01:16 It's a sham.
02:01:16 Vote Bernie.
02:01:17 Vote Bernie, where yang?
02:01:19 That's my slogan.
02:01:20 Are you at all...
02:01:21 Bernie just had like a heart attack or something.
02:01:23 Is he doing okay?
02:01:24 He had an operation.
02:01:25 He had a heart operation.
02:01:28 He's doing okay.
02:01:29 His poll number is not so much.
02:01:32 Well, I guess I'm not surprised.
02:01:33 Warren's the leader.
02:01:35 She's the front runner.
02:01:37 I hear us with one.
02:01:38 Shut up, Mage.
02:01:39 Shut the fuck up.
02:01:40 No, you should have.
02:01:41 I mean, Mage has nothing,
02:01:43 has no horse in this race, literally.
02:01:45 She's not even American.
02:01:46 So, you know, what can you say?
02:01:48 Well, neither am I.
02:01:49 I don't know.
02:01:50 I mean, I heard...
02:01:50 It's not that I'm just falling asleep.
02:01:53 Not because of you guys.
02:01:54 I told, like, at the beginning,
02:01:55 I'm just, like, extremely tired right now.
02:01:57 That is a personal problem, Mage.
02:01:59 We feel the same time every week,
02:02:00 so we bear no responsibility.
02:02:02 I know.
02:02:03 Okay, we'll go.
02:02:03 I set my sleep schedule just for you guys.
02:02:07 I appreciate that.
02:02:09 I heard that Bernie's heart trouble
02:02:11 was not, like, an immediate life-threatening thing
02:02:14 or anything.
02:02:15 It's not like his heart's gonna stop anytime sooner.
02:02:18 I mean, he is old.
02:02:19 Well, in the great scheme of things.
02:02:20 I'm sure I know he could die.
02:02:21 Like, this is...
02:02:22 Obviously, this is always a possibility.
02:02:24 Anyone can die.
02:02:25 Yeah.
02:02:26 But...
02:02:26 Yeah, Ben.
02:02:27 Makes me mad.
02:02:27 Why is he, like, I have fucking bad experience on that.
02:02:29 He's still on the campaign trail.
02:02:31 Pretty sure he's still doing all this shit,
02:02:33 so that's great.
02:02:34 Okay, great.
02:02:35 Great.
02:02:35 Thanks for ruining our country, uh, everyone.
02:02:39 All right.
02:02:39 Blame Bernie for not having...
02:02:41 Oh, remember the senator from Metal Gear Rising?
02:02:43 How he had that fucking Super Armistall...
02:02:44 Yeah, the original...
02:02:45 The original Magamon.
02:02:46 ...Nanomachines?
02:02:47 Now, that's what Bernie should do.
02:02:48 He should just pull a senator Armstrong,
02:02:51 and start the war economy up,
02:02:52 because God knows we could use it.
02:02:54 All right, let's move on.
02:02:55 He doesn't even like that guy.
02:02:57 Oh, that's why he's going to lose,
02:02:59 because he's not even utilizing the war economy
02:03:01 to its full extent.
02:03:03 Put some brains in vets.
02:03:03 I always felt a senator Armstrong was like Milhouse.
02:03:08 You know, Milhouse...
02:03:09 In that one episode where they go to the future,
02:03:11 Milhouse was canonically jacked as shit,
02:03:14 and was super ripped, and...
02:03:16 Except his damn ankles,
02:03:17 because that's the hardest place to add mass, damn it.
02:03:19 And how dare you judge him for it?
02:03:21 That happened in that episode.
02:03:23 All right, next, next voicemail.
02:03:24 Is that the one where Lisa becomes president?
02:03:27 No, I don't think so.
02:03:29 She's going to get married in this one,
02:03:30 and then did it at the end?
02:03:32 Is that the one with Hugh?
02:03:32 Like a monkey's paw.
02:03:34 Yeah, like her British fiancé or something from school.
02:03:38 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:03:38 Do you know that according to Christine Weston Chandler,
02:03:41 Lisa Simpson will be president in 2020?
02:03:43 I heard about that.
02:03:44 I do.
02:03:44 And so maybe Bernie is going to die,
02:03:46 but Lisa's going to show up with an equally progressive agenda.
02:03:50 Okay, just point of order, though.
02:03:52 Lisa is eight years old canonically,
02:03:54 which is under the age of, you know...
02:03:56 Not in...
02:03:57 Look, ask Chris.
02:03:59 Like, I don't think so.
02:04:00 All right, all right.
02:04:01 Fair enough.
02:04:01 Okay.
02:04:02 We got another one.
02:04:03 Okay, a little baby one from Timmy Sorris.
02:04:06 Let's see what this is about.
02:04:07 She's been there for like 20 years now.
02:04:09 Well, yeah.
02:04:09 Maybe he's incorporating the like.
02:04:10 Yeah, but in, you know, 1998...
02:04:14 97 or whatever it is.
02:04:15 When the episode aired,
02:04:16 she would have been, you know, 30, whatever, in 2020.
02:04:21 Now that...
02:04:21 But now that it is 2020,
02:04:24 she's still eight, but...
02:04:26 Perhaps, perhaps like...
02:04:27 But not in that one episode.
02:04:29 Maybe when the dimensional merge happens,
02:04:32 all timelines will like merge into a single streamline,
02:04:35 like single time progression.
02:04:36 So like, Lisa will age up to a proper age in our dimension.
02:04:40 Do you know, do you remember like how...
02:04:44 I think there was a YouTuber who did a Simpsons lore thing.
02:04:47 Was it the real Jim?
02:04:48 He like...
02:04:49 I can't remember.
02:04:50 I love the real Jim.
02:04:51 There was a video.
02:04:53 There's a video where he explains like,
02:04:56 or he shows that like a Homer and Marge's relationship,
02:05:00 you know, back when they were kids.
02:05:03 It used to be in the 80s or the 70s.
02:05:05 Then it was the 80s.
02:05:06 It was the 90s.
02:05:07 Yeah.
02:05:08 Soon they'll be having like a millennial childhood upbringing.
02:05:11 Oh, right.
02:05:12 He had...
02:05:13 It's true.
02:05:13 Yeah, that's the real Jim's.
02:05:15 He did...
02:05:15 He does Simpsons histories where he talks,
02:05:17 looks at like the timelines, past, present, and future.
02:05:19 He just released...
02:05:20 Well, a couple weeks ago, he released...
02:05:22 He had a series of like,
02:05:23 who really shot Mr. Burns?
02:05:24 And he just released like the final piece of it.
02:05:27 And he lays out five different theories for like,
02:05:30 like the canonical explanation is that Maggie shot Mr. Burns?
02:05:33 Right.
02:05:33 But he makes...
02:05:34 He actually makes like four different compelling...
02:05:37 No, five different compelling cases for why actually that's a fake out.
02:05:41 No, actually Bart shot Mr. Burns.
02:05:43 No, actually Lisa shot Mr. Burns.
02:05:45 No, actually Homer shot Mr. Burns.
02:05:46 What's this guy's name again, Ben?
02:05:47 The real Jim's.
02:05:49 The real...
02:05:49 I'm watching that shit because I fucking love that episode.
02:05:52 The only good Simpsons YouTuber.
02:05:55 Period.
02:05:57 They all...
02:05:58 He's the only one.
02:05:59 He's the only one.
02:06:00 That's great.
02:06:01 I just noticed that it says it's Simpsons mysteries,
02:06:03 who really shot Mr. Burns finale.
02:06:06 Was this like a series of videos?
02:06:07 Well, yeah, he did five episodes,
02:06:08 like one episode is Bart, one episode is Grandpa,
02:06:11 and so on and so forth.
02:06:12 It's...
02:06:13 Each one is a different theory.
02:06:15 Well, I gotta fucking check this shit out.
02:06:17 Those are really good.
02:06:18 Post a link of that.
02:06:20 Here, I've got the video.
02:06:21 This is the finale.
02:06:22 So don't watch this one first, I guess.
02:06:23 Maybe I'll find the updated one.
02:06:25 Okay, boom.
02:06:26 In the audio links, there you go.
02:06:28 And I'm gonna go watch more.
02:06:29 I'm gonna watch these after we run here.
02:06:30 Do you like the Simpsons?
02:06:30 And I love the Simpsons.
02:06:33 I would encourage anyone to check out the real...
02:06:35 I think he's got like 40k followers,
02:06:37 or like 30k subscribers.
02:06:40 He's got 50k, it looks like.
02:06:41 Oh, okay, he's growing, that's good.
02:06:43 There you go.
02:06:43 I mean, it's such a niche market,
02:06:45 I can't see him getting that much bigger than that,
02:06:47 unfortunately.
02:06:48 People love their big video,
02:06:50 analyzing one possibly beloved piece of media
02:06:54 in thorough detail,
02:06:55 and possibly teaching us about life
02:06:58 and lessons beyond the mere panels of the artistry.
02:07:02 I don't know, whatever.
02:07:03 Okay, anyway, voicemail, Timisaurus, go right now.
02:07:07 Son of George Soros?
02:07:08 I feel like I'm the only fucking one
02:07:11 who fucked PCP through the YouTube search bar
02:07:15 by typing in meme podcast.
02:07:20 That's it.
02:07:21 That's the whole message.
02:07:22 We were talking about how people found us last time.
02:07:26 Is, man, could that be true?
02:07:28 Is that possible?
02:07:29 Let me try it right now, meme.
02:07:31 Oh, that's a great idea.
02:07:32 My podcast.
02:07:35 I want to try it too.
02:07:36 Let me see how far down I have to scroll to find...
02:07:40 I mean, I see...
02:07:41 Oh, wait, I'm logged in as the PCP.
02:07:43 It's lots of...
02:07:44 It's lots of H3H3.
02:07:51 What, who are you logging in?
02:07:52 Okay, to be fair...
02:07:53 I logged in as myself.
02:07:54 To be fair, it might not have been directly
02:07:56 from the search result.
02:07:57 You could have clicked on something
02:07:58 and, like, in the related, eventually,
02:08:00 it found the PCP, but it started...
02:08:02 Yeah, I didn't know if I exactly had one.
02:08:03 We must have an episode that has meme in the title,
02:08:06 so I'm assuming that you found...
02:08:06 Memes that need to die.
02:08:08 It's right here.
02:08:08 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:08:08 The Professor's Podcast, episode 16.
02:08:11 Wait, you got it on a search?
02:08:13 Yeah, it's way down, but there it is.
02:08:15 Memes that need to die.
02:08:17 That could be it.
02:08:18 That could be the avenue right there.
02:08:19 Oh, fuck, what's the thumbnail on that again?
02:08:21 It's a bunch of our icons and the old logo,
02:08:25 and it just says in green text,
02:08:27 PCP, episode 16, Memes that need to die.
02:08:30 Oh, yeah, it just says, like, the green text thing.
02:08:32 I can't find it, but I'm sure you're not lying.
02:08:36 Check the playlist.
02:08:36 It's episode 16.
02:08:38 No, no, no, I mean on the search.
02:08:39 Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
02:08:41 Well, there you go.
02:08:41 There's one avenue.
02:08:42 Okay, we got two more voicemails.
02:08:45 Let's burn through them.
02:08:46 Okay, here we go.
02:08:47 This is Poo's Adventures in Communist Hell, episode one.
02:08:52 Episode one.
02:08:53 Let's see what Poo has in store for us.
02:08:55 Take it away.
02:08:56 Hello, it's now time for another one
02:08:59 of Poo's Adventures in Communist Hell.
02:09:02 Please enjoy.
02:09:03 Yay.
02:09:05 I am so excited.
02:09:09 There it is.
02:09:13 Feels good.
02:09:14 My dad's home.
02:09:15 Yeah.
02:09:16 Peglet, I've got a rumble in my tumble.
02:09:21 Do you want to join me for a sport of honey?
02:09:27 Dear Poo, we don't have any honey.
02:09:32 You ate it all.
02:09:34 Hi, Peglet, I knew.
02:09:38 But what if we went looking for some honey?
02:09:43 Poo, I'm a little tender as a bitch.
02:09:47 I'm too scared to go on a adventure
02:09:49 to find some honey.
02:09:52 Peglet, I'm going to find some honey.
02:09:56 And I bet to see you right behind me.
02:09:59 What else?
02:10:04 Dear, dear, I just hope we don't run into that
02:10:08 Christopher Robin boy again.
02:10:13 Thank you.
02:10:14 And please look forward to the next episode.
02:10:17 Goodbye.
02:10:20 Yeah.
02:10:21 I loved it.
02:10:22 Guys, I cracked the code.
02:10:24 Memes podcast.
02:10:25 Memes plural.
02:10:26 Third one down is our podcast.
02:10:29 Oh, OK.
02:10:29 OK.
02:10:30 When you do memes podcast.
02:10:32 E.
02:10:33 I did.
02:10:34 I did a venture.
02:10:35 Yeah, OK.
02:10:36 It's for me, it's like the eighth one down or ninth.
02:10:38 But yeah, I did find it on the unjust meme.
02:10:40 It was down.
02:10:41 I had scrolled past it.
02:10:42 It's down maybe like 20 or so.
02:10:45 I did a good job.
02:10:46 Good work team.
02:10:47 More importantly, Poo, tell me more.
02:10:50 That wasn't communist enough.
02:10:53 I think he's warming up to it.
02:10:54 Now, is it communist because of the honey shortage?
02:10:57 Perhaps that's where the honey shortage is exactly.
02:10:59 They have to go foraging because the supply lines have failed.
02:11:02 I don't know.
02:11:03 The honey lines have dried up.
02:11:05 There's no more.
02:11:05 I don't know.
02:11:07 I remind me.
02:11:09 I saw Christopher Robin.
02:11:11 Just reminds me of my own depiction.
02:11:12 And the boy, the human.
02:11:14 My own depiction of something that you might call communist hell
02:11:17 in the pages of my nightstar, phantom horn,
02:11:20 strawberry milk, New Los Angeles City, and less war comic.
02:11:23 Indeed, indeed.
02:11:24 And their musical number.
02:11:27 Neath the city.
02:11:28 Oh, yeah.
02:11:29 Neath the city.
02:11:30 Neath the city.
02:11:35 Slime left us wanting.
02:11:36 So now we're haunting the bourgeoisie.
02:11:39 I was delighted to see that wisely strawberry milk and phantom horn
02:11:47 knew better than to accept the temptress that is the human nature
02:11:50 defying evil system that is communism.
02:11:53 No, no, they are firmly entrenched in neoliberalist capitalism.
02:12:00 They are in that mind cage for life.
02:12:05 Well, there's always hope for tomorrow.
02:12:06 So things you learn in a question.
02:12:09 Well, OK.
02:12:10 Pooh, keep us updated.
02:12:11 Looking forward to episode two, Piglet Godspeed.
02:12:14 OK.
02:12:14 We've got one last one.
02:12:16 This is brief.
02:12:17 This is from a little guy named One Second Voicemail.
02:12:22 Let's see.
02:12:23 You were yesterday.
02:12:23 Merciful.
02:12:24 All right.
02:12:25 See you in the next one, PCP.
02:12:26 Yeah.
02:12:27 And with that, that's it.
02:12:28 Thank you, everyone.
02:12:28 That's been another episode of The Proof.
02:12:31 Crastinators podcast.
02:12:33 In my head, I was imagining like the firstest dab caught on film.
02:12:38 Yes.
02:12:41 All right.
02:12:41 You're done.
02:12:42 Patreon.com.
02:12:43 You think that was in response to what we were talking about
02:12:45 before about the One Second YouTube video?
02:12:49 I think it was.
02:12:50 I think it was inspired by that.
02:12:51 That's my guess.
02:12:52 That's my guess.
02:12:53 And it should be done.
02:12:54 Someone should still get out there and do it.
02:12:55 Maybe next time he'll give us another One Second Voicemail
02:12:58 episode two.
02:12:59 All right.
02:12:59 Thanks, guys.
02:13:00 See you next time.
02:13:01 We can only hope.
02:13:03 All right.

02:13:13 It'll be up by the time this goes up, right?
02:13:18 Well, the last one's already up.
02:13:19 The next one, no.
02:13:20 It's only the 13th.
02:13:21 We don't put it out till the first.
02:13:22 So we might film it before then.
02:13:24 But no, we're not even...
02:13:26 We're actually filming it after this episode goes up.
02:13:28 So no, we'll keep them waiting.
02:13:30 We'll keep them waiting.
02:13:32 We have something more in the oven right now, cooking.
02:13:35 And it'll be a good time.
02:13:36 It will be a good time.
02:13:37 It will be a good time.
02:13:39 Something to look forward to, actually.
02:13:40 I think people will be excited about it.
