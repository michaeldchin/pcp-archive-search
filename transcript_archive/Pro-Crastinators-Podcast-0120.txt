00:00:00 Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:15 Oh, it's a pleasure to have you.
00:00:17 This is 120, isn't it?
00:00:18 This is episode 120, that's correct.
00:00:20 Episode...
00:00:21 We got all the power stars, everyone.
00:00:23 Is that...
00:00:24 Oh, right.
00:00:25 Yoshi is confirmed for Smash.
00:00:27 Oh, can we get Yoshi on the podcast?
00:00:29 Yoshi!
00:00:30 There he is.
00:00:31 I checked his Twitter the other day, and he said some real racist shit.
00:00:35 I don't know if we want to get into that.
00:00:36 That's true.
00:00:37 We got to keep his race realism to a minimum on this podcast.
00:00:40 I'm the best guy ever, and we're joined today by Yoshi.
00:00:44 Wahoo!
00:00:45 Wahoo!
00:00:46 It's me, Yoshi.
00:00:47 All right.
00:00:48 Also Munchy's here.
00:00:49 You know it.
00:00:50 There's Yoshi's digits.
00:00:51 There he is.
00:00:52 Ben St.
00:00:53 You know, I remember, like a couple days ago, I thought of something really funny that I
00:00:57 would say for my intro on the next PCP.
00:01:00 It's totally gone.
00:01:02 No one will ever hear it.
00:01:03 I'll never remember what it is.
00:01:04 So I'm just going to disappoint everyone.
00:01:05 That's what you wrote it down.
00:01:06 Yeah.
00:01:07 Ben, it would have been so easy for you to just say that and not have actually come up with
00:01:11 any thought.
00:01:12 Then just think to yourself, I'm going to just say that I have thought of something.
00:01:16 I'm going to say that I've thought of something on the podcast.
00:01:21 This whole thing can be a little just as bad.
00:01:24 I don't believe you.
00:01:25 Curious.
00:01:26 No one will ever know.
00:01:27 And also, it's also Mage.
00:01:28 I am forever suffering.
00:01:29 Hello.
00:01:30 Hello.
00:01:31 Greetings, individuals.
00:01:32 It's another one of these that you've signed up for, signed away your soul in time for another
00:01:43 episode.
00:01:44 Here we go again, everybody.
00:01:45 There it is.
00:01:46 Shout out.
00:01:47 Hey.
00:01:48 I checked my podcast listing app, which I use to listen to other podcasts, Cast Box
00:01:51 on Android.
00:01:52 Shout out and free advertising.
00:01:53 Shout out if you're listening to this on Cast Box right now.
00:02:05 We have two comments, one of which I don't even think is pertaining to the podcast.
00:02:11 I have no idea what it is.
00:02:13 Here, I'll get it up right now.
00:02:16 The procrastinators.
00:02:17 We have something like 400 watches or something.
00:02:21 It's absolutely better.
00:02:22 Just like us.
00:02:23 No, no, no.
00:02:24 We only have 100.
00:02:25 Wait, where is this?
00:02:26 The two comments on...
00:02:28 It's on a podcast listening app, like one of the most popular podcast apps on Android.
00:02:32 Basically, I have no Android listeners is what this means.
00:02:35 By Austin Baker, you guys want to wrap these up?
00:02:43 Oh my God, what are the implications that the episodes need to be shorter or that this
00:02:49 whole thing we're doing just needs to stop now?
00:02:52 That's a wrap, though.
00:02:53 That's a wrap.
00:02:54 Oh my God.
00:02:55 I love you, Austin.
00:02:56 All right.
00:02:57 Then by Xavier Jackson, I don't know what the fuck this means.
00:03:02 The vague helicopter parent slash millennial pussy slash let kids fight and get bullied
00:03:09 narrative was lame, especially in the light of the common counter example she presented.
00:03:14 What the fuck is this guy on about?
00:03:18 Maybe he commented on the wrong podcast.
00:03:21 Lately, I get all these comments from people where they take whatever I've said and then
00:03:27 assume that because it sounds kind of like something some philosopher said, that I am
00:03:32 basing it off of that or whatever other thing they've heard of.
00:03:36 For instance, in my video about Isiah from Doodadada that I posted the other day, I got
00:03:41 two different comments being like, oh, your Hobbesian social ideas are incorrect.
00:03:47 I was like, I don't even know who Hobbes is.
00:03:49 Maybe they're not saying you read Hobbes.
00:03:51 Maybe they're just comparing your ideas to those of Hobbes.
00:03:53 One of the guys literally described me as trying to out Hobbes Hobbes.
00:03:58 I was like, well, I haven't read.
00:04:00 I was like, what exactly is the problem in this video?
00:04:03 He's like, well, it's clear that you just got all your ideas from Hobbes.
00:04:06 I'm like, I don't know who Hobbes is.
00:04:09 I don't know how that's possible.
00:04:11 I only know Calvin.
00:04:13 I haven't gotten to Hobbes yet.
00:04:14 I'm very confused right now.
00:04:16 The weird thing about it is that a lot of the times, the things I'm saying might be
00:04:21 Calvin and Hobbes.
00:04:22 They might be close to them.
00:04:23 God damn it.
00:04:24 Yes, they are.
00:04:25 Sorry.
00:04:26 They're named after Calvin and Hobbes.
00:04:28 A lot of the times, the things I'm saying, they might sound tangentially similar to
00:04:33 what these guys are saying, but the part that I didn't say that they would have is the
00:04:38 most important part.
00:04:40 People take the fact that you said something kind of similar, and then they just extrapolate
00:04:44 that you also mean the rest.
00:04:46 It's like, no, I don't mean the rest.
00:04:47 I mean the part that he said that was correct, and not the part he said that was incorrect.
00:04:52 So when this guy says like, helicopter parents, I don't think any of us would encourage helicopter
00:04:59 parenting.
00:05:00 I think that we might have said something that was kind of helicopter parents.
00:05:04 Did anyone use that phrase?
00:05:05 I don't know.
00:05:06 I think I've talked about stuff about that.
00:05:08 It's the one where you're kids and over.
00:05:10 No, it's when you turn into a helicopter.
00:05:13 Right.
00:05:14 It's when people...
00:05:15 Oh, it's when Yoshi gets the helicopter power up.
00:05:18 It's when people are trying to disparage trans people, and they say, I identify as an attack
00:05:24 helicopter.
00:05:25 That's helicopter parenting.
00:05:27 Right, right, right.
00:05:28 But yeah, I'm sure that we probably said something that indicated we were okay with
00:05:33 something that could be construed as helicopter parenting.
00:05:37 As though thinking one thing that's fairly overreaching is okay, and then just extrapolating
00:05:43 oh, we all just think helicopter parenting is okay.
00:05:45 And it's like, no, we didn't go that far.
00:05:48 We went a little far.
00:05:49 I mean, it's ridiculous to just extrapolate because one's philosophy has some connection
00:05:55 with a philosopher that you reach the exact same conclusions.
00:05:59 I mean, it's the Hitler family.
00:06:01 It's so easy.
00:06:02 It's so easy to just hear things that people are...
00:06:06 Oh, that's true.
00:06:07 Right, so easy to just hear one sentence that could have started.
00:06:11 It's like some alt-right video, and just assume what someone is saying.
00:06:14 It just is some dog.
00:06:16 I want to say, I want to say...
00:06:19 I have a relevant experience.
00:06:21 I have a perception of forever color.
00:06:23 I have a relevant experience, recent kind of.
00:06:26 Some people might have seen it on Twitter that I posted.
00:06:30 A while ago, there was this video on YouTube, and they were doing an animation meme.
00:06:35 They were playing my animation meme in the corner, I'm guessing for reference or for
00:06:39 audio or whatever, and I left a comment.
00:06:43 Are they doing the same meme?
00:06:44 Aren't they animating the same meme or something?
00:06:46 Yeah, they're animating something themselves.
00:06:48 Like, incompletely or something, Ryan?
00:06:50 What?
00:06:51 Never mind.
00:06:52 Okay, just go on.
00:06:53 Go on.
00:06:54 What they were doing is fine.
00:06:57 They were taking my idea for the animation meme and doing their own with the characters
00:07:02 they were presenting, and that's fine.
00:07:04 That's what animation memes do.
00:07:06 The issue I had, the small issue I had, was that they were playing my video at the top,
00:07:11 and it's not breaking into laws or rules or whatever, but they didn't credit me or anything,
00:07:16 and I would have preferred if they had.
00:07:18 It's just common courtesy.
00:07:20 It is common courtesy.
00:07:22 Yeah, and I left a comment saying, in polite terms, I said,
00:07:27 hey, maybe you should maybe not use other people's videos in the corners,
00:07:32 or if you're gonna do that, at least credit them.
00:07:36 And then, like, I also edited the comment later on,
00:07:40 because I saw a lot of people saying, oh, you copied, oh, you traced,
00:07:43 and I was like, no, that person did not trace,
00:07:46 and an animation meme is basically taking the same idea
00:07:50 and just doing it with your own characters, kind of.
00:07:53 Did this person acquiesce?
00:07:54 Did they put you in the description or anything?
00:07:56 No.
00:07:57 Well, really?
00:07:58 Yeah, it's eight months later, at least, still haven't credit me.
00:08:00 Eight months later, wow.
00:08:02 They're probably not going to do it.
00:08:04 That's just bad.
00:08:05 They probably don't give a shit.
00:08:06 Yeah, the issue is not there.
00:08:07 Like, okay, whatever, things like that happen.
00:08:11 But I politely, even in my comments, I said,
00:08:14 this person is not tracing me.
00:08:17 They are not copying me.
00:08:18 Please, to all the people that are saying that they are, they're not.
00:08:24 This animation meme is fine.
00:08:26 The only issue I have is that, you know,
00:08:28 they could have at least credited me.
00:08:30 That's all.
00:08:31 That's the small issue I had with the video.
00:08:33 Did they play other videos or just yours?
00:08:38 No, it was just that animation meme,
00:08:41 and they used the audio from the video they were playing of my video.
00:08:44 So it was just, in that instance, it was just my video,
00:08:47 but I have seen on their channel, they did it at least once
00:08:50 with some other video, I think.
00:08:52 I haven't really researched them.
00:08:54 I mean, I guess this person just doesn't really care about the good crediting.
00:08:59 The thing is, though, I got a lot of replies to that comment,
00:09:03 just like, how dare you bully this person
00:09:05 and think that they're stealing you.
00:09:08 Why do you think, you know, they're not stealing from you,
00:09:11 you're just bullying them, you're harassing them.
00:09:14 It's just like...
00:09:15 Well, is it because you're big?
00:09:16 They're the one who took your video.
00:09:18 Is it because you have more subs, so it's like punching down?
00:09:22 Yeah.
00:09:23 Probably.
00:09:24 Probably, but the thing is, like, they didn't even read what I said.
00:09:26 I specifically said to the people that were harassing the person
00:09:30 is like, this person is not stealing from me.
00:09:33 I just wanted them to credit my video since they used it in their video.
00:09:37 And the people go on and think that I was...
00:09:41 There was...
00:09:42 I mean, I'm totally with you, Mage.
00:09:44 There was an incident, I mean, a while back,
00:09:46 that everybody probably remembers.
00:09:47 There was just an...
00:09:48 I made my video about communist glasses not being orange, whatever.
00:09:52 And, like, I used a picture of a cosplay girl who...
00:09:55 Yeah.
00:09:56 She, like, had very orange glasses for her coming to cosplay.
00:09:59 And I used the picture and said, like,
00:10:01 ah, this is bad, like, ah, you know, you suck.
00:10:04 Like, something along those lines.
00:10:06 And she commented saying, like, hey, you have stolen my work
00:10:10 and put it, and have used it.
00:10:12 And, I mean, she was just very upset.
00:10:14 I don't think she asked me to, like, take it down, but she was mad.
00:10:17 I'm really glad you brought this up because that attitude pisses me off so much
00:10:21 when people say things like that about their fucking fan work.
00:10:25 Okay.
00:10:26 Because I want to say to that woman, did you ask anyone
00:10:29 on the Girl in the Gone production team
00:10:31 if you could use their character and intellectual property
00:10:34 because they can sue you for that?
00:10:36 I think that if this picture was, like,
00:10:39 if this picture was, like, paywalled or something,
00:10:41 then I think she's got a point.
00:10:42 But if this was something that she, like, made and tweeted
00:10:45 and, like, posted publicly, I don't think...
00:10:46 If it was paywalled, then it's super illegal
00:10:48 and she shouldn't be able to paywall her, like...
00:10:51 But people do that.
00:10:52 People, like, cosplay.
00:10:53 Well, yeah, it's like a Patreon cosplay or something, you know?
00:10:56 I think that's all...
00:10:57 I think I love that that economy exists,
00:10:59 and I would defend the idea that it should be possible
00:11:02 and companies should embrace it because it promotes their characters.
00:11:05 Like, that's why they're not going around shutting all this stuff down,
00:11:08 but, like, all of it is technically, you know, they can.
00:11:12 Like, it used to happen at a lot of anime conventions.
00:11:14 Like, they could probably issue some kind of cease and desist
00:11:17 if they were so inclined.
00:11:18 Like, in the artist alley, there used to be lots of stories
00:11:21 of, like, anime company representatives
00:11:23 just going around and being like,
00:11:24 hey, you're not allowed to sell art of our character
00:11:26 and just shutting down stalls.
00:11:27 Like, Disney famously does that.
00:11:29 Yeah, I was thinking.
00:11:30 I was thinking.
00:11:31 I was in Anime Expo recently.
00:11:32 I was just in the artist alley, and it hit me.
00:11:35 This is totally fucking illegal.
00:11:37 Like, you can't just sell pictures of Pokémon.
00:11:39 Right.
00:11:40 Well, okay.
00:11:41 When you say it's illegal, what it is is it would be a...
00:11:44 I think it's a civil issue where they may be doing something
00:11:48 that a company would have a claim to object to,
00:11:51 but until they object, it is not, like, really an issue,
00:11:55 or it's not quote-unquote illegal.
00:11:57 I think it is definitely...
00:12:00 Yeah, I guess it's theft of intellectual property, right?
00:12:04 I mean, I just don't think that's a great...
00:12:07 I don't know.
00:12:08 I sympathize with the companies that want to protect their brand image,
00:12:10 but, I mean, I think we're all better, obviously.
00:12:12 It has someone who makes derivative quote-unquote artwork on the Internet,
00:12:16 but she sympathizes with desire.
00:12:18 Yeah, when I was researching copyright for a few reasons,
00:12:22 I did come across, like, it's not good.
00:12:27 It's not legal if you're sort of like,
00:12:30 let's say the company is making fleshy toys,
00:12:32 and you start making fleshy toys of the same characters,
00:12:35 and, you know, that's obviously very wrong.
00:12:37 So, like, if you create competition with their intellectual property,
00:12:43 or whatever, something like that, so...
00:12:45 The idea behind fair use is that it's only fair use
00:12:49 if it doesn't compete with the original product
00:12:52 or could not stand as a replacement of it.
00:12:54 That's always the defense I use with my videos,
00:12:57 because, like, I obviously use tons of footage from anime,
00:12:59 but it's like, this in no way is representative of the product,
00:13:02 because I've cut it into a bunch of random 10-second clips
00:13:05 that I'm talking over it, and it's like,
00:13:07 you're not getting the experience of watching the show.
00:13:10 So, like, if it was something that directly competed,
00:13:14 and even then, I'm going to defend my stuff,
00:13:16 because I don't care if it actually is legal to do what I do.
00:13:20 I'm just going to appeal to the logic of these companies,
00:13:23 and, like, for instance, Sentai Filmworks got in contact with me.
00:13:27 You guys can see that in this picture.
00:13:29 I've posted it in the chat that has my DMs in it.
00:13:32 But Sentai Filmworks took down my
00:13:37 Astroscore Sucks Part 12A and 12B video,
00:13:40 which is where I was, like, defending Shivery of a Failed Night,
00:13:42 which is their show.
00:13:44 That's the one that they own.
00:13:45 It's the one that I was, like, you know, saying is better.
00:13:48 And so I just basically went on Twitter and was like,
00:13:50 hey, everybody, this company took down my video.
00:13:53 Why don't you tell them how that makes you feel?
00:13:55 And there was, like, dozens of people saying,
00:13:57 like, I only watched this show because of that video,
00:13:59 or, like, I bought this show from you because of this video.
00:14:02 You need to bring it back.
00:14:03 Right.
00:14:04 And when enough of that happened, Sentai contacted me,
00:14:05 and their response was to the effect of, like,
00:14:07 hey, we really appreciate that you promote our videos,
00:14:10 our content.
00:14:11 We hope you keep doing it.
00:14:12 Like, we'll get in contact with our Flagger team.
00:14:14 Now, granted, they haven't actually gotten my videos back yet,
00:14:17 so this is not me praising Sentai Filmworks for doing the right thing.
00:14:21 Hopefully it's just bureaucracy that's loaded up at this point.
00:14:24 Yeah, I hope so.
00:14:25 But in any case, like, you know, it's not that I actually care
00:14:29 whether my video is fair use or not.
00:14:31 I kind of approached it like, hey, guys, if you take down my video,
00:14:34 you're going to piss off your own fans.
00:14:37 You're going to piss off the people who want to support you.
00:14:39 So, like, you know, this is not in your best interest as a business
00:14:42 to take this action, even if it was legally correct.
00:14:45 Here's a question.
00:14:46 Here's a question.
00:14:47 Well, we're talking about, talking about artist alley artists drawn like...
00:14:49 Wait a minute, before we finish that,
00:14:51 I just want to put a cap on what I was saying about that girl,
00:14:53 which was simply that.
00:14:54 When she requested, I mean, she was mad that I used her video,
00:14:57 or that she used her picture, and just expressed disinterest.
00:15:01 What I did was I credited her in the comments,
00:15:04 which I think was in the description,
00:15:06 which I think was a completely reasonable request,
00:15:08 and I would do so of anyone.
00:15:09 If you look at my videos these days,
00:15:11 you will see me crediting as much fan artist physically possible
00:15:14 and asking anyone who wants credit to let me know,
00:15:16 and I will add you, because I think that is the right thing to do.
00:15:19 But I would never, ever take it down at someone's request.
00:15:23 Oh, God, no.
00:15:24 We're using this.
00:15:25 I've had my fair share of people coming to me with the same request
00:15:29 of like, hey, can you put a credit for me in the description and stuff,
00:15:32 and it's amazing how snooty them and their fans will get.
00:15:37 One time I used...
00:15:38 I mean, they feel taken advantage of, so I sympathize.
00:15:41 But one time I used this dude's...
00:15:44 This dude did a heavy metal cover of a Kill Law Kill song,
00:15:47 and I just showed a short clip of that video of him playing the song in my video,
00:15:53 and he's like, hey, man, kind of a dick move to not give me credit or whatever,
00:15:58 and then I added the credit to the description,
00:16:01 but in response to him or on his channel and stuff,
00:16:04 there was just tons of his fans being like,
00:16:06 oh, it's wrong to steal people's content,
00:16:08 and I'm like, again, you did not ask the permission to make a Kill Law Kill theme cover.
00:16:14 This is a cover of a corporation's intellectual property, yeah.
00:16:18 And no one ever complains that I've got all this footage from the anime in there,
00:16:23 which is equally like, you know, I'm not crediting Trigger.
00:16:28 It's punching down.
00:16:32 I don't really believe in the whole punching down paradigm, though.
00:16:35 I get it. I think it makes sense. I just think you should keep some perspective.
00:16:39 I think you should punch anyone who's wrong.
00:16:41 That's my stance on punching.
00:16:43 I don't like punching. It's a complicated thing, I guess.
00:16:46 What were you saying? You were going on about some bullshit, as I recall.
00:16:50 That's right. I'm queuing up after Ben.
00:16:52 Sure.
00:16:53 So you got some fan artists, the artist Allie, selling like a really nice painting of a really nice painting.
00:17:01 Samus.
00:17:02 No, of a hit Montab.
00:17:04 You got this absolutely scrumptious hit Montab, you know, just rendered in glorious-
00:17:10 That's even more sexual.
00:17:12 The realistic light on this hit Montab is just unreal.
00:17:16 It's like you really had hit Montab too much.
00:17:18 You can feel the hip hop beat emanating from the canvas.
00:17:21 He just leaps off the page with his enthusiasm for battle and dancing.
00:17:26 But anyway, here's my question.
00:17:28 Is that taking away from...
00:17:31 Do you think that a person who is buying that work of art,
00:17:34 would they have otherwise purchased a work from Nintendo,
00:17:39 a piece like a hit Montab poster officially sold by Nintendo or something?
00:17:44 They're going to think that this is a really weird monster that they're not going to even know what it is that they don't know what it is.
00:17:49 No, no, no. That's not what I'm asking.
00:17:51 I'm asking you, without the artist, without the fan artist, would they...
00:17:55 Look at it.
00:17:56 Did this artist take the sale away from Nintendo?
00:17:58 Would that customer have gone to Nintendo to purchase an official hit Montab merchandise?
00:18:04 You're right, Ben. The answer is no.
00:18:06 The answer to that is no, but you can think about it from another perspective as well,
00:18:09 which I'm sure is how the company thinks of it.
00:18:12 It's that this product would not exist, if not for Nintendo and the Pokémon company, whatever,
00:18:18 creating this intellectual property that you are now capitalizing on to make a sale.
00:18:25 I could certainly see why they deserve perhaps at least a share of what's going on there.
00:18:30 It's not a matter of necessarily whether it competes with something they already have.
00:18:35 It's whether it could potentially compete with something they intend to create,
00:18:39 and like the fucking Samus remake, remember?
00:18:42 Or even more importantly, to all of us, and the Fighting is Magic video game, where...
00:18:50 Of course, of course.
00:18:51 All of these...
00:18:52 There's a great video about this by that dude...
00:18:56 What's the name of the black guy from Two Best Friends Play?
00:18:59 Oh, Wully.
00:19:00 Yeah, Wully. He had made his own channel and his first video was about addressing this idea
00:19:06 that the reason these games all get shut down is that these companies...
00:19:10 If they don't shut down your game, it makes a precedent that they don't do that,
00:19:15 and that they allow this, and it makes it legally harder for them to defend themselves later
00:19:21 if they did want to make a competing product with you,
00:19:24 that they can't just shut down your game after having allowed it to exist, basically.
00:19:29 I think also the reason why they shut down Pixelmon after years of not doing anything...
00:19:36 People speculate it, I'm not sure, but I think it's because they release later on Pokemon Quest,
00:19:40 which is like, you know, QB Pokemon sort of creatures,
00:19:44 and aesthetically, it's similar-ish.
00:19:48 I mean, I don't really see it, but people have been speculating that's why they shut it down,
00:19:53 and I'm a little scared if that's the reason.
00:19:56 Yeah, like from a business perspective, it's a business, and actually it's a fiduciary responsibility.
00:20:01 Fiduciary, yo!
00:20:04 Fiduciary, that's right, that's right.
00:20:06 It is their fiduciary responsibility, like if they have a publicly traded company,
00:20:10 to protect the earnings of their shareholders to do whatever it takes
00:20:15 to preserve profits now and any potential profits in the future.
00:20:19 So it's... I mean, yeah.
00:20:21 I don't speak too angry with them.
00:20:23 I know the whole, down with the corporations, down with the big man, yada yada.
00:20:27 But I can't be angry if they're just doing stuff to protect their intellectual property,
00:20:33 so if they have to do it...
00:20:35 I think we all kind of just wish it didn't have to be that way, but, you know...
00:20:39 But yeah, I wanted to say just a little bit, as a content creator,
00:20:44 as, you know, I used to do Fannert and stuff like that, as one of those people
00:20:48 whose art gets used on the internet.
00:20:52 I would just like to say, like, the things like reposting my art, I don't approve of it.
00:20:57 Like, if you let's say... I really hate Pinterest because of it.
00:21:01 I despise Pinterest.
00:21:03 It's just, I hate when my art gets taken to a different site and then posted without my permission.
00:21:09 With Pinterest, I think most of it is credited.
00:21:12 Some of them are credited wrong, and there's nothing I can do about it.
00:21:15 But, um...
00:21:17 Yeah, I hate my art being taken to a different site and then, like, just losing track of it, so to speak.
00:21:24 My fucking Galco video has been reposted to Tumblr many times and accrued millions of views,
00:21:29 and that's a real shame for me, you know, financially and whatnot.
00:21:33 Would have been nice if everyone just came to YouTube to watch it, and I earned the pittance of ad revenue that it gets.
00:21:38 Could have just embedded on Tumblr, too.
00:21:40 Yeah.
00:21:41 Hey, Ben, going back to your...
00:21:43 Hang on, Major's still finishing a point.
00:21:45 Yeah, it's just like, but with, let's say, fan art for things...
00:21:51 Hold on, now a last one point.
00:21:53 My art, yeah, okay.
00:21:55 When I do fan art for a character, like, for instance, Mothit, my very first Undertale fan art,
00:22:00 it's quite popular, and it was, I think, used in design, but the proceeds from that design were for charity or whatever.
00:22:06 Yes, Z.
00:22:07 It's pronounced Z.
00:22:08 In my head, I called it Zine, and it's a habit.
00:22:12 I wouldn't mind so much, but you're not the only one.
00:22:15 Shut the fuck up, it's not Zine.
00:22:17 No, it's Zine.
00:22:18 It doesn't make any sense.
00:22:19 Wait, Zine, did you make the Zine?
00:22:21 Major, what's the, I don't know, what's this about a Zine?
00:22:24 Yeah, it got featured in the Zine, I think, but I didn't get any money from it because it was for charity.
00:22:32 That's just to sort of emphasize how popular it got.
00:22:35 Like, they contacted me and they asked if they could use it because I didn't go to them, they came to me.
00:22:41 That's kind of flattering.
00:22:42 Anywho, but like, yeah, it's quite popular, and several people have asked, go on and actually messaged me and asked me,
00:22:50 like, hey, could I use this as a picture for my musical cover on YouTube and stuff like that.
00:22:56 And I'm like, fine, I'm more than happy to let people do that with fan art of characters if, you know, they ask.
00:23:02 And they, like, it's not a repost, but they do their own thing with my art.
00:23:08 So it's kind of like, what's the word, transformative in a way?
00:23:12 Yeah, sure, somewhat.
00:23:14 You know, they're not just...
00:23:15 It's using it for our purpose, it's not just taking the artist's position.
00:23:18 Well, what if my purpose is just to make money by reselling Major's art, like, on a poster?
00:23:22 Like, that's my purpose.
00:23:23 Well, then no.
00:23:24 Oh, then no.
00:23:25 Yeah.
00:23:26 No, no.
00:23:27 I'm here, I'm here to commodify Mage and the...
00:23:31 As he does with all women.
00:23:34 No, that's right.
00:23:35 There's a difference.
00:23:36 Don't objectify, commodify.
00:23:39 Yeah, it's a way of saying that.
00:23:42 But yeah, like, so I'm pretty...
00:23:44 What a progressive that bit.
00:23:47 Guys.
00:23:49 But yeah, like, I'm perfectly fine with people, like, asking for...
00:23:53 You know, if they ask for permission and they credit me and they use it in that sort of thing, that's fine.
00:23:58 I've seen several people re-uploading the video, like, the sort of animatic thing of the dubbed, like, Papyrus, Sans, and Metaton, like, they go on a date or whatever.
00:24:11 That video, it got, like, it was my most popular one for a while.
00:24:15 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:16 And people have re-uploaded it.
00:24:17 However, they did credit it in me and they dubbed over with their own voice.
00:24:22 So, I don't...
00:24:23 Okay, there's something there.
00:24:24 There's something okay there, kind of.
00:24:26 Yeah, so, like, I don't mind it too much.
00:24:28 I'm not too happy about it.
00:24:30 I would have preferred if they had asked, I guess.
00:24:32 I would have probably said, yeah, sure, okay.
00:24:34 I think one of them did, and I did give them a get-go.
00:24:38 So, yeah, those sort of things, fine.
00:24:40 When it's fanart as well, like, I can understand why you want to use it in that way, so long as you give credit to me and, you know, doing something trans-morbid, not just re-posting it.
00:24:50 I'm usually fine with it.
00:24:51 Fine with it.
00:24:52 You know what?
00:24:53 This makes me rethink a little bit my statement before about how, like, the whole punching up, punching down thing is irrelevant.
00:24:59 Because, like, if you, for example, just took, like, any anime and did a fan-dub over it, like, I wouldn't blink twice.
00:25:06 I'd be like, this is fine.
00:25:07 But if it was, like, one person's animation, like, on their YouTube, I'd be like...
00:25:11 Yeah, the funny thing is there's definitely a difference in kind.
00:25:15 There's obviously a difference in the way that we perceive those things because of how we perceive those companies and people, but I think that's wrong of us to do.
00:25:24 You might be right.
00:25:25 What I hate about the whole idea of punching up, punching down is that it stratifies, like, you're putting worth on people on the basis of their social clout, which is totally unfair.
00:25:36 Because it's not as though someone having more attention means that they have more rights or a better life, you know?
00:25:43 To suggest that because someone's famous, they are now just open to criticism.
00:25:48 It's like, why would that person, how is them getting famous forfeiting their right to be treated the exact same way that you would be treated?
00:25:57 Especially when fame is not a linear, like, thing that makes you just happier or, like, better.
00:26:04 And I don't understand what the metric is that we are now allowed to make this person sign all the shit on, you know?
00:26:12 I think I know why people feel that way.
00:26:14 And it's because of the perceived power that, like, famous people have, specifically, where, like, they have a...
00:26:20 And this is a real thing of influence, of being able to shape the world to a degree.
00:26:25 So you want to help me wrap up your point?
00:26:27 I want to quickly wrap up my point.
00:26:30 Kujoto, Arbok, Hitmontop, Pitmonly.
00:26:33 Yeah, Ketchum.
00:26:35 No, no, no, I'll be quick.
00:26:37 Hitmontop's Gen 2, you stupid motherfucker.
00:26:39 He's not in the poker world.
00:26:41 Hitmontop, please continue.
00:26:43 I'll be quicker.
00:26:45 What I was talking about was mostly about, like, fan art and fan work and stuff like that.
00:26:49 When it comes to my OC as personal art, I am a lot more strict about people doing that.
00:26:56 And I would probably not allow it, even with credits, because those are my creations.
00:27:01 And I'm like, I'm a nobody on the internet.
00:27:03 If someone took it, if someone takes my fan art of a character and they'll go like,
00:27:07 oh, yeah, that's a character from that game.
00:27:09 And, you know, they get pretty...
00:27:11 Major, quick question.
00:27:13 That makes sense to me, but here's my question.
00:27:15 Why doesn't that same level of, like, protectiveness extend to something like a Sans or Papyrus
00:27:21 or just, like, any famous online character?
00:27:24 Like, why doesn't it go to those guys?
00:27:26 I suppose because, like, I don't own the characters, so I can't...
00:27:31 So you just leave it up to whoever actually, like, owns them to worry about that stuff?
00:27:36 No, it's not like that. It's just like...
00:27:38 I would understand that.
00:27:40 It's like...
00:27:42 I'm more protective of my characters because my characters are mine and I love them and I would hate...
00:27:47 It would devastate me, people taking them for their own.
00:27:51 And, like, you can't...
00:27:53 Like, when my art is used with my permission, it's usually, like, for a cover song,
00:27:58 for a cover for a song.
00:28:00 It's like a thumbnail for a video, something like that.
00:28:03 If they're, you know, they're talking about the topic and they're just using my image
00:28:07 to illustrate what they're talking about or what they're doing.
00:28:10 It's not taking those...
00:28:13 They're not taking my characters and claiming it as their own with my OCs.
00:28:18 No one knows what those OCs are, who those OCs are.
00:28:21 Like, I think the only sort of exception is for when people would review specifically my OCs and my art,
00:28:29 stuff like that.
00:28:30 That's the only exception because that video is, you know, about me and my art rather than, like...
00:28:34 But if someone takes my OCs and use them, like, I don't know, as a talk sprite,
00:28:39 or as a background image while they're talking about something irrelevant,
00:28:43 people start associating my art, my character.
00:28:47 I would say that goes beyond, like, fan art at that point, where that's...
00:28:50 Yeah, that is someone, like, that's using it in a way that competes with your content.
00:28:56 Like, you're basically...
00:28:57 Yeah.
00:28:58 That person is now altering the narrative of your character in a way.
00:29:03 Like, I understand what you're concerned about is, like, this person is going to make your character
00:29:07 associated with something that has nothing to do with you,
00:29:10 and now you've lost control of the narrative surrounding your character.
00:29:13 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:29:14 Yeah, and I think that even famous characters, like, I would say probably...
00:29:19 Even Sans has been almost completely co-opted by the much more popular variant of Venom Sans.
00:29:25 I was going to say that, like, that's definitely something that's happened with, like,
00:29:29 the Undertale characters where there was, for a while, like, everyone ascribing,
00:29:33 like, specific, like, you know, gender denominations and stuff to them that become...
00:29:38 Yeah, Crying Sans is a perfect example.
00:29:40 Like, yeah, people have created this alternate version that has nothing to do with what Toby Fox presented,
00:29:46 and, like, whether or not he's okay with that, like, he could have made a public statement or whatever,
00:29:51 but, like, the fact is that this character has gotten away from him culturally,
00:29:55 and I don't even know if I think that's unfair.
00:29:59 I appreciate why for someone like Mage, who, again, sees herself as an Internet nobody,
00:30:04 it's like, if you haven't even had the chance to tell the story you wanted to tell with these characters
00:30:09 and other people are already telling an alternative story, then it's like, your story just never got told.
00:30:14 And I do think that that sucks, and, like, I would argue that it's something that I wouldn't want people to do,
00:30:22 but I also don't know if I think that it's wrong, per se. You know what I mean?
00:30:27 Like, if we're going to extend that to people who are Internet nobodies,
00:30:32 I feel like that same respect should be paid to someone like Toby Fox, you know?
00:30:37 Feelings-wise. In terms of my emotional reaction, there's definitely a spectrum there.
00:30:42 We're drawing a picture of Sans in a cool different outfit or something.
00:30:48 That's one end of the spectrum, and then on the other end is taking Mage's character
00:30:54 and using it as a talk spread for a completely other personality and some other work and not crediting them.
00:31:01 There's a continuum between there, and definitely at some point it starts to feel wrong,
00:31:06 but I don't know exactly at what point does it go from a fan work to a transgression.
00:31:12 If Undertale had just sold Shiddly and nobody liked it, I feel like all our feelings would change on this matter.
00:31:19 It also depends on how the person themselves feels, though, because for me, I might create a character
00:31:26 that I don't have any intentions with, and then if someone wants to use my character as a talk sprite,
00:31:31 I'd be like, hey, sounds like a way to market my character and potentially draw attention,
00:31:37 but I might contact this person and ask how I could work with them.
00:31:41 Again, there's a million possibilities with all of it, and it really just comes down to just respecting people's emotions or not.
00:31:50 If Mage comes out and says, hey, don't use my characters, it's not that I think that there needs to be a legal precedent
00:31:58 or anything that she can defend them, it's just like if you respect Mage as a person,
00:32:03 don't do the things she doesn't want you to do, and if you don't care, then just expect her to hate you.
00:32:10 If you do that kind of thing without credit, then you're stealing, and that's definitely wrong.
00:32:15 If you do credit them, but you do something that the author does not want you to do,
00:32:20 even if you credit them, it's maybe not wrong in the way that stealing is wrong,
00:32:25 but it's like, I'm doing this without the permission of the author, the original creator does not want this.
00:32:30 I guess in the perfect world, that would be a stain on your work that should make people not appreciate it and not like it,
00:32:39 but I'm sure that not every case does that happen.
00:32:42 It's not like a legal wrong, it's just a social wrong.
00:32:44 It's highly disrespectful that I think about it.
00:32:47 You're taking this person's work, their hard work, their creation, and they're not speaking about me specifically,
00:32:53 now I'm thinking about something else, but you're taking their work, and you're using it, you like it enough,
00:32:59 you're using it for your own gain, but you don't respect the creator of the work you're using enough to go along with their wishes.
00:33:09 I think a lot of it is really just laziness.
00:33:11 It would be so easy.
00:33:13 We can't take someone to court for this, but we can job lynch mob them and slander their name on social media.
00:33:19 Let me play the other side of the field for a second here, though, and try to explain why I think most of this happens,
00:33:24 because in cases like Crying Sands, the kind of people...
00:33:29 Who is Crying Sands, though?
00:33:31 I know there's so many Undertale versions, but I've never heard about Crying Sands.
00:33:38 Crying Sands is just the general trend.
00:33:42 Immediately after Undertale got big, people would tend to draw scenes of Sands getting really emotional and crying.
00:33:49 Because the idea is essentially that because Sands has been through the most out of everybody,
00:33:55 that people depict him crying because it's reasonable to expect him to be a sad boy,
00:34:01 there's just nothing in the game that actually presents that angle.
00:34:04 We don't see him crying.
00:34:06 The temptation there is because he's such a together guy, and he's the most powerful and the most knowledgeable,
00:34:12 to depict him breaking down is like, this is the ultimate, this is the ultimate emotional whatever.
00:34:17 To talk about why I think people would draw that, it's because people are pathetic.
00:34:23 When you think about why would somebody...
00:34:27 Especially artists, let me tell you.
00:34:29 Why would somebody need Undertale in their lives?
00:34:32 You need it because it gives you something.
00:34:36 As a human being, it enriches you in some way.
00:34:39 And for some people who don't have the huge cavalcade of media,
00:34:44 all of us, we have a shitload of stuff that we like.
00:34:46 None of us is just into one thing.
00:34:48 Even if we all did absolutely love Undertale, it's none of our only thing.
00:34:54 And I can imagine somebody who gets into this game.
00:34:57 I'm only into one thing, Digi.
00:34:59 Keto, continue.
00:35:01 Of course.
00:35:02 I imagine that if somebody got into Undertale, and that was their whole world,
00:35:05 and it was the only way they really understood how to express their innermost thoughts and feelings,
00:35:12 Oh, shoot, I did draw crime scenes.
00:35:15 That's exactly what kids are like.
00:35:17 Kids use cartoons and shit.
00:35:19 These kids are playing Undertale, and they're going like,
00:35:22 How do I represent what this made me feel when I don't have my own characters?
00:35:27 I don't have my own ideas.
00:35:29 And it's free social cloud online because you're drawing this character that people already care about.
00:35:36 People care about your art automatically, whereas you could not build that by yourself.
00:35:41 That is laziness, but I understand why if you're a kid and you don't understand
00:35:46 that the people who made this stuff had to work so hard to create these things
00:35:51 to learn how to create good characters.
00:35:54 Toby Fox obviously is not a newcomer.
00:35:57 Even if it's his first game that made him popular,
00:36:00 this dude's been creating stories and music and art for a very long time.
00:36:05 Yeah, he had to mention he's been on the inside of the Homestuck,
00:36:09 so he's obviously been around down the street.
00:36:11 Exactly.
00:36:15 What's that made?
00:36:16 I did draw sans crying, I linked it.
00:36:18 That's hilarious.
00:36:20 I need that to enrich me as a person.
00:36:23 There's another reason why I just figured out why people want to repost this and share it.
00:36:28 The first sentence is please do not repost slash use without permission.
00:36:31 Well, let me tell you what my first thought is when I see that sentence.
00:36:34 It's what I'm thinking about doing right now.
00:36:37 There's always a question that comes up every once in a while,
00:36:40 you know, what Pokemon is the PCP?
00:36:42 What would the PCBs for Sona be?
00:36:45 What sans would be?
00:36:46 What emotion sans is the PCP?
00:36:49 You can call that one right now.
00:36:51 Hitmontop is a pretty similar color scheme.
00:36:53 I'm prepared to just say hitmontop is sans.
00:36:56 Wait.
00:36:57 That was not the question.
00:36:59 It wasn't though.
00:37:00 No, but valid answers.
00:37:03 I'll take one again.
00:37:05 That's kind of relevant to what I was saying.
00:37:07 For a lot of kids who only have so many media points of reference,
00:37:11 they tend to constantly do that kind of comparison.
00:37:14 Everyone in my group of friends corresponds to an undertale character.
00:37:18 It's like everyone in your group of friends
00:37:20 corresponds to a member of a group of friends
00:37:22 in literally any game or piece of media you could play.
00:37:26 Which sex in the city girl are you?
00:37:28 Exactly.
00:37:29 Which golden girl are you?
00:37:31 That's all they've seen.
00:37:32 I'm Rose.
00:37:33 I'm the mom.
00:37:34 I'm the mom.
00:37:35 You are the mom.
00:37:36 I used to do that with my friends when I was eight
00:37:38 and we saw Rose on YouTube.
00:37:40 We all did it.
00:37:41 In the PCP, we used to do it all the time.
00:37:43 Talk about which my little pony guys were we.
00:37:45 But then we would just extrapolate that into every other show.
00:37:49 I've made any show I watch.
00:37:52 I could take the characters and say,
00:37:53 oh, that one's Nate.
00:37:54 That one's Kion we did it with.
00:37:57 Oh, your Ritsu, your Rainbow Dash.
00:37:59 No shit.
00:38:00 Any sporty character is going to be Nate, you know.
00:38:04 Yeah.
00:38:05 Yeah.
00:38:06 You said social cloud a minute ago.
00:38:08 Sorry to take this, we can go back to what we were talking about before,
00:38:11 but I want to mention that I was thinking about this the other day.
00:38:14 It makes me very upset.
00:38:16 It makes me despair to think about why people like things.
00:38:20 Because sometimes it feels to me in life that people,
00:38:23 especially on the internet and just like in public,
00:38:26 people like things as a public performative display of allegiance.
00:38:33 People like things and are vocal about liking things
00:38:36 in a way to ally themselves with this thing.
00:38:42 With certain YouTubers, right?
00:38:44 Maybe someone wants to be like,
00:38:47 maybe people want to be like armored skeptic or what's that other guy?
00:38:54 Sargon of a cottage or what's that, you know, these douchebags.
00:38:57 And so, you know, they're going to make videos that are like them.
00:39:00 They're going to like them on Twitter.
00:39:02 They're going to retweet their shit and be a big fan of them
00:39:05 and shout them out if they make their own videos.
00:39:07 And that's true of like everything.
00:39:09 I feel like people like Undertale or people, I don't know.
00:39:12 Ben, this is also true of you.
00:39:15 It is true of me.
00:39:16 And the point is that there's no escaping this.
00:39:18 There's no escaping this.
00:39:19 I would say this is the purpose of art.
00:39:21 Like, I think that what it mostly is there to do is to...
00:39:24 It feels impure.
00:39:25 It feels like all love.
00:39:27 All love is impure love.
00:39:29 Accurate.
00:39:30 I think it's all of this art and all of the way we respond to it is
00:39:34 it's us reaching into ourselves and trying to figure out who we are.
00:39:38 And then we see something that makes us say,
00:39:41 oh, that's what I am.
00:39:42 Now I get it.
00:39:43 Now I understand why I think this way.
00:39:45 You know what this is?
00:39:46 And then you just keep collecting those, you know?
00:39:48 That is the micro opposite side of the coin against like widespread politics.
00:39:55 Because politics is like the exact same thing only on the macro level.
00:39:59 We're like politicians.
00:40:00 So like, I feel like when people are telling like, oh, politicians are evil.
00:40:04 Like us doing this thing is like aligning ourselves with groups that don't like perfectly represent us.
00:40:08 Like yes, the scale is different, but it is the same sort of problem.
00:40:12 Right.
00:40:13 Only like an individual level as opposed to politicians trying to align us in groups.
00:40:17 I feel like maybe my example was weird there.
00:40:19 Like, I don't know.
00:40:21 Do you think that people like publicly perform their love of something like Undertale or Homestuck or whatever?
00:40:28 Because like, I think there's like some, like you could do that because something speaks to you
00:40:34 and because you feel passionate about it and it means a lot to you.
00:40:37 You could also maybe do it because it's cool and because you think it makes you look cool to like this thing.
00:40:43 That's definitely a part of it.
00:40:45 Personally, as a person who has created fan art for things, I usually do it because I really like the characters.
00:40:54 I usually draw characters.
00:40:55 I like the characters and I just sort of like want to...
00:40:58 What do you mean by like though?
00:41:00 Define like.
00:41:01 Incidentally, I think we can all refer to ourselves as people who have made fan art of things.
00:41:06 It's kind of like all of our...
00:41:08 I mean like drawn fan art, I guess.
00:41:10 When I made that image, I drew it.
00:41:11 I think we also have drawn fan art of things.
00:41:14 When I finished Lisa for the first time, I spent a couple days.
00:41:20 I worked on this piece of Lisa fan art that was really, I'm pretty proud of it.
00:41:24 Oh, that Lisa.
00:41:25 Yeah, yeah.
00:41:26 And on the one hand, like I did it because like I love the game and I love the story and I love the character
00:41:32 and I love the ending and I just wanted to depict the ending in like a cool way.
00:41:37 I think I've said this before, but like when I do fan art of something, it's like I love this thing so much.
00:41:42 I want to like participate in its glory a little bit, you know?
00:41:46 Yeah, yeah.
00:41:47 I want to be a little part of this thing that I think is great.
00:41:51 But also...
00:41:52 I want to like...
00:41:53 I'm sorry.
00:41:54 For me personally because...
00:41:55 Wait, let me finish this point.
00:41:56 What do you mean by that?
00:41:57 God damn it.
00:41:58 But in addition to that, I also was very gratified to see that like that image is relatively high
00:42:03 if like you search Lisa images, like it turns up fairly easily in a Google search
00:42:07 and it did really well on Twitter and I think the creator retweeted it and stuff.
00:42:11 And like so I was like...
00:42:12 That's because you did such a good job of understanding it.
00:42:16 Like me and Lisa, there's like a Lisa link.
00:42:19 Hang on, wait.
00:42:20 There's like a Lisa link.
00:42:21 God damn it.
00:42:22 Everyone live the fuck up.
00:42:23 There's like a thing between me and Lisa.
00:42:24 Like I'm...
00:42:25 And I was gratified.
00:42:27 I was like, I think it's cool that I am associated...
00:42:29 I want to be associated with this thing because this is the thing that I think is good.
00:42:32 You know what I don't like about that?
00:42:33 All this stuff.
00:42:34 I feel like...
00:42:35 Doesn't it feel a little impure?
00:42:36 Yes.
00:42:37 Like, ah, look at this cool thing someone else made.
00:42:39 Let me just hitch my wagon to this and ride it for a while.
00:42:42 Here's why.
00:42:43 No, yeah.
00:42:44 That's my problem.
00:42:45 I really want to blow this all wide open here because first of all, let me ask you, what
00:42:47 is the purpose of language, of communication?
00:42:52 It is to bridge the gap in discrepancies between the information we have, right?
00:42:58 Like I know a thing, I want you to know the same thing so I say it to you.
00:43:02 And we have the English language, we have all these different spoken languages that
00:43:07 are good for that.
00:43:08 But sometimes the idea is so complex that even if you understand it, you have no idea
00:43:14 how to communicate it except in reference to someone else who has already communicated
00:43:18 it.
00:43:19 So, like, Ben resonates with Lisa super strongly because it says something that he agrees
00:43:24 with very strongly.
00:43:26 And maybe there's not a way for him to easily or concisely explain that in words, but Ben
00:43:31 is capable of drawing pictures that perfectly capture what he likes about Lisa.
00:43:36 Like what about this game says the same thing that he's thinking?
00:43:38 If nothing else, it probably highlights the moment that Ben most strongly resonated with,
00:43:44 which in itself is like a distinct form of like a pinpointing.
00:43:47 It's focusing in on this one thing.
00:43:49 So when Ben posts that and when there's two layers to it, like he just said, there's
00:43:53 the layer of like, I wanted to show my appreciation for this thing that communicates something
00:43:57 that I agree with and want to also say, like, and I'm saying it in my own way with a little
00:44:03 twist.
00:44:04 I'm making my version of the statement, but it's close enough to the original and it's
00:44:09 so it has so much of the same appeal as the original that the people who like it inevitably
00:44:13 will also like Ben's art.
00:44:15 And that's why it is so popular and that's why he also in turn feels good about feeling
00:44:19 like he best captured what was good about this game, you know, better than other artists
00:44:24 were capable of.
00:44:25 Would you agree with that, Ben, as my analysis of your fan art?
00:44:28 Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.
00:44:30 I get little tingle.
00:44:32 When I think about that picture, it makes me think about the ending of Lisa and I just
00:44:36 get, I get, I get a weird like tingly, I get a weird like breathless sensation just because
00:44:40 I love it so much.
00:44:42 I wanted to say something before Lisa, like with me with me personally, it's like a part
00:44:49 of me is like, okay, so I really like this thing, right?
00:44:52 And I want to sort of participate in the thing that I like.
00:44:55 So I sort of like create the art for it, just like to express myself, express my like love
00:45:02 for it and sort of practice.
00:45:03 Major, I'm sorry.
00:45:04 Can I interrupt real quick?
00:45:05 Because the PCP just got a one-darl patron from Past Analysis, baby.
00:45:09 Hey!
00:45:10 Welcome, buddy.
00:45:11 Hey, Past Analysis.
00:45:12 What's up?
00:45:13 Hey, see you at BronyCon, dude.
00:45:15 Yeah, BronyCon.
00:45:16 BronyCon 2019.
00:45:17 Oh, oh, oh, can we please, can we please grandfather in Past Analysis be a CMC member of the PCP?
00:45:25 Can we, can we?
00:45:26 Can we upgrade?
00:45:27 Can we upgrade?
00:45:28 Okay, I wasn't here last week.
00:45:29 What about that we are going to BronyCon 2019?
00:45:32 Briefly, I think.
00:45:33 Supposedly some of you are.
00:45:34 Yeah, and we are.
00:45:35 We see a Briterite that's not a joke, that is not a joke, everyone.
00:45:37 We're not like doing that, you know, to make you laugh, Brony.
00:45:40 No.
00:45:41 No.
00:45:42 We are actually going to BronyCon.
00:45:43 Well, it is, it is pretty, it is really fucking funny.
00:45:44 But we are.
00:45:45 Okay, okay, sure.
00:45:46 But I'm doing it for real.
00:45:47 But I'm doing it for real.
00:45:48 That's a sigh.
00:45:49 All right, that sounds good.
00:45:50 But I totally interrupted Mage.
00:45:51 I'm sorry.
00:45:52 I'm going to mourn.
00:45:53 Please continue.
00:45:54 And now I forget.
00:45:55 Oh, I'm so sorry.
00:45:56 It was just really fucking funny.
00:45:57 No, it's okay.
00:45:58 It's okay.
00:45:59 But yeah, if Pest is reading it, hi Pest, I haven't heard your name in years, probably
00:46:03 literally years.
00:46:04 I heard that name in years.
00:46:06 Exactly.
00:46:07 Why can't we get patron from Dr. Wolf?
00:46:12 Soon.
00:46:13 Why, why, why are we so below Dr. Wolf?
00:46:15 Oh, no.
00:46:16 Oh, no.
00:46:17 Pest analysis is actually cool and I want a patron from him.
00:46:20 If Dr. Wolf patroned us, I'd be like, what's happening?
00:46:22 Is this subterfuge?
00:46:23 Like, I've been talking shit about this guy for years.
00:46:26 He hasn't even done anything new to me.
00:46:28 I mean, he probably doesn't even know.
00:46:30 I mean, you know, I don't know.
00:46:32 Different world.
00:46:33 I don't think it's possible to talk shit about somebody online and then not get sent
00:46:37 it.
00:46:38 Yeah, maybe.
00:46:39 Like, I guess every time someone even so much as mentions me on the internet, someone
00:46:43 sends it to me and I don't know why because I don't necessarily want all of it.
00:46:47 I do and it's people who are like other YouTubers and who I don't expect, like who I don't see
00:46:54 it coming from.
00:46:55 Like sometimes it'll be people who I've been like, for a recent example, there's a YouTuber
00:47:00 called Ocelot, O-S-C-I-L-L-O-T who like I collaborated with back in 2015 and like I thought his videos
00:47:07 were super cool.
00:47:08 It was one of the few like anime analysis channels I was kind of excited about.
00:47:11 But he kind of disappeared to go become an editor for another guy who I don't care about.
00:47:15 And like recently, like, he was just talking shit about me like really aggressively on
00:47:21 Twitter and like not tagging me or anything.
00:47:25 Was that person MatPat and did he commit suicide?
00:47:27 Oh, jeez.
00:47:28 Well, first of all, MatPat didn't commit suicide.
00:47:30 First of all, it's not even the same, it's not the same guy.
00:47:33 Well, I'm just, because you said this guy became an editor, so I thought, oh, he's probably
00:47:38 the editor that got himself from, you know.
00:47:42 You just had to think about it.
00:47:45 No, where it was confusing is you said was this guy MatPat and I thought you were talking
00:47:51 about the person I was describing.
00:47:52 No, I meant the guy that he went to go edit for.
00:47:53 Yeah, I feel you.
00:47:55 I get it now.
00:47:56 And it is funny in retrospect.
00:47:58 By the way, I am mildly curious who he's working for.
00:48:00 It was Mr. AJ Cosplay, now known as the Cartoon Psych.
00:48:04 The guy who edits for.
00:48:05 No idea who that is.
00:48:06 He's a guy who does like a lot of videos about dub acting and shit.
00:48:10 I don't care about it.
00:48:11 But so this us like I was like talking shit about me and Zen Huxdable like just quote
00:48:17 tweeted him was like, yeah, you should probably tag at DigiBraw if you're going to talk shit
00:48:20 about him.
00:48:21 Sure.
00:48:22 Thank you, Zen, for telling me that like this guy who I've been telling people is like one
00:48:26 of the cool anime analysis channels for years is now just shitting on me for no apparent
00:48:31 reason all over Twitter.
00:48:33 So I do like when people send me stuff like that because I want to know like, you know,
00:48:38 before I go talking people up who are apparently hate me for no reason.
00:48:41 I understand.
00:48:42 What was he saying?
00:48:43 He was talking about some weird dream he had where he had to have like an analysis debate
00:48:47 with me.
00:48:48 The way he was describing it was like, yeah, I had to listen to his insufferable fucking
00:48:52 prick voice, arguably, or whatever, just like, I was like, what did I do to this guy?
00:48:58 I fucking paid him for a collab one time.
00:49:00 I paid him money last time we interacted.
00:49:03 What?
00:49:04 I love I love people that give me money like Cy, who paid me to design a t-shirt.
00:49:11 So I promoted his Kickstarter because I want to encourage people giving me money.
00:49:15 And I, for what it's worth, the last time I talked shit about Cy all the time and he
00:49:20 talked shit about me and we both give each other money in support.
00:49:23 So there you go.
00:49:24 Oh, God.
00:49:25 What a great relationship.
00:49:28 Can we please, can we please just back, can we please back up a moment and discuss what's
00:49:34 really important?
00:49:35 Because Ben, about your, about your example in the R.S.T.A.L.Y. about a hip-mon-top painting.
00:49:39 Yeah.
00:49:40 I fucking pray I want there to be a beautiful hip-mon-top painting because look at this
00:49:44 change you want to see in the world.
00:49:45 This hip-mon-top, hip-mon-top is one of the Pokemon that is banished from ever having
00:49:51 any merchandise whatsoever.
00:49:53 This is the official Pokemon store.
00:49:56 And hip-mon-top, zero matches.
00:49:58 They're not a single piece of plush figures and pen, training cards, clothing, home
00:50:02 offices, video games, or all other categories.
00:50:04 No beauty, no beautifully rendered oil paintings of hip-mon-top art galleries.
00:50:09 I literally own a hip-mon-top plush.
00:50:11 Like I can't see it from here because it's blocked.
00:50:14 Why are they selling it then?
00:50:16 Why are they afraid to bring it back out?
00:50:18 They must have made it.
00:50:19 Why are they silent hip-mon-top?
00:50:20 Like sold at some underground office.
00:50:21 What are they hiding?
00:50:22 Yeah, why are you silent hip-mon-top?
00:50:23 First of all, it's Jones and now hip-mon-top.
00:50:25 When does it end?
00:50:26 All you guys are telling me right now is that I could sell this hip-mon-top on eBay for
00:50:29 a lot of money.
00:50:30 That's what I'm getting at.
00:50:31 Yeah.
00:50:32 The market is surging with demand for hip-mon-top right now.
00:50:34 I need that hip-mon-top.
00:50:35 Bad!
00:50:36 Bad!
00:50:37 Did you get it?
00:50:38 Bad!
00:50:39 Like everybody, everybody.
00:50:40 I need it!
00:50:41 If you're listening, invest in hip-mon-top now.
00:50:43 The price of the sky rise.
00:50:44 That's true.
00:50:45 On the hip-mon-top plushie, does he have a tail?
00:50:48 I don't have it on me, but I mean, it's an official plushie.
00:50:51 I got it in like back when Gen 2 came out.
00:50:54 But that's the question because like you see Munchie has been spamming us with hip-mon-top
00:50:57 images.
00:50:58 And like at the very first one, it looks like he has like either a third foot or a tail,
00:51:02 but then the following ones.
00:51:03 That's his penis mage.
00:51:04 That is his penis.
00:51:05 No, he's got a little.
00:51:06 This bulbous.
00:51:07 Yeah, he's got a little.
00:51:08 Yeah, he's got two of them.
00:51:10 You know what I'm saying?
00:51:11 The one that I just got from the show, you can see his tail if you look very carefully
00:51:15 at his.
00:51:16 Oh, yeah.
00:51:17 Yeah, okay.
00:51:18 He's definitely supposed to have a tail, although it seems like it varies in length.
00:51:22 Like sometimes it's just a tiny little nub and sometimes it's long.
00:51:25 Maybe that's a gender difference.
00:51:26 I'm curious.
00:51:27 Maybe it extends.
00:51:28 Because like, yeah, like look at the very first image.
00:51:31 He has very long legs, but then the following images is very stumpy.
00:51:35 It attracts it to help with his spinning.
00:51:38 Yeah, like, like, yeah, like, yeah, that makes sense.
00:51:41 Okay.
00:51:42 Wait, wait, wait.
00:51:43 This is so, yeah, in like the 3D, the 3D models, his tail is like incredibly short, but then
00:51:48 in like the old sprites, it's relatively long.
00:51:51 Like you can see like a connecting like, like strand or whatever.
00:51:55 That's so weird.
00:51:56 And I hate it.
00:51:57 Do you guys remember the 3D?
00:51:58 I hate the move to 3D.
00:51:59 Do you guys remember the Hitmontop game in Pokemon Stadium 2, where you spin around
00:52:07 as Hitmontops and they're like, Beyblade each other out of the arena?
00:52:11 Beyblade?
00:52:12 Dude, that's what it says.
00:52:13 That sounds sick.
00:52:14 Have you guys not played Pokemon Stadium?
00:52:15 Listen, everything you guys say in Hitmontop is going in one ear and out the other, because
00:52:20 all I know is that I need that.
00:52:21 I need it bad, did you?
00:52:23 I need that Hitmontop bad.
00:52:25 Okay, so like one episode before the last one, I mentioned about a topic I wanted to
00:52:31 talk about, and we were going to talk about that topic today, but like we started talking
00:52:35 about other things and we're already an hour in, so I really want to talk about the topic
00:52:39 right now.
00:52:40 We're only 50 minutes in.
00:52:41 I'm down.
00:52:42 I'm down.
00:52:43 I get it.
00:52:44 There is no topic, first of all.
00:52:45 Second of all, I want to talk about a very disappointing interaction that I had on Twitter,
00:52:50 because I saw...
00:52:51 Were you asking why for Hitmontop?
00:52:53 Were you just connected to what we were just discussing, or are you just like listening
00:52:57 to the fact that Mage wants to do a topic, and then being like, no, I want to do the
00:53:01 topic?
00:53:02 No, it's not connected to Hitmontop.
00:53:03 It's connected to what we were talking about before Hitmontop.
00:53:05 Okay, all right.
00:53:06 Let's wrap it up.
00:53:07 All right.
00:53:08 What do you got?
00:53:09 All right, so I saw...
00:53:10 None other than Christine Weston Chandler was tweeting about how much she loved...
00:53:14 God, what the fuck is her name?
00:53:17 No, I love Kim Possible a lot.
00:53:19 Oh, okay.
00:53:20 And I saw an opportunity, right?
00:53:22 Of course.
00:53:23 Sure.
00:53:24 And I was like, wow, this lady, she's into my shit.
00:53:28 So I tweeted at her, and I was like, do you like any other pony analysis channels?
00:53:34 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:53:35 I saw this tweet.
00:53:36 I'm a big fan of T-Bat, personally.
00:53:38 And she responded.
00:53:39 She said she did not say anything about T-Bat, but she responded that she liked Kim Possible
00:53:43 a lot and Dr. Wolfe.
00:53:45 And I want to say that...
00:53:49 I think that it is very telling...
00:53:51 I think it is very telling that Chris Chan does not appreciate T-Bat and loves Dr. Wolfe.
00:53:59 So listen, she has allied herself with Dr. Wolfe by publicly professing her liking for
00:54:04 it, but not with T-Bat.
00:54:05 So T-Bat is pure.
00:54:06 T-Bat is pure and good.
00:54:08 Dr. Wolfe?
00:54:09 Yeah, that's true.
00:54:10 Or T-Bat just is just not the standards that Chris Chan demands, and you're saying that
00:54:14 if you want to be...
00:54:15 So it kind of sounds...
00:54:16 If you like...
00:54:17 If you appreciate what Dr. Wolfe does, you have...
00:54:18 If you appreciate what Dr. Wolfe does, you have tastes comparable to Chris Chan.
00:54:21 I just want to put that out there.
00:54:22 I think it kind of seems like Chris Chan is just into people who are currently doing
00:54:27 My Little Pony reviews.
00:54:28 Like, surely if T-Bat came back...
00:54:30 Oh my god, we've got to bring it back.
00:54:31 ...surely if you maxed her vibe with T-Bat, Chris Chan would have the opportunity.
00:54:35 Oh, man.
00:54:36 We've got to let Chris Chan know that the future's looking bright.
00:54:40 Um, boy.
00:54:42 All right, Mage, what did you want to talk about?
00:54:45 It's not a super interesting topic or anything, but I really wanted to talk about it because
00:54:50 it's one of my favorite topics.
00:54:51 For like...
00:54:52 Yes.
00:54:53 It's one of my favorite topics.
00:54:54 And I want to talk about dreams.
00:54:55 Not like your goals or whatever, but like, you know, when you sleep and you have dreams
00:54:59 and you're like listening...
00:55:00 I'm not familiar with the concept.
00:55:02 Please, yeah.
00:55:03 When you close your eyes and you fall asleep and then you see images that are not real.
00:55:08 Okay, images.
00:55:10 What concept?
00:55:12 I mean, those are what dreams are, yeah.
00:55:14 I didn't launch into it, but I did have an amazing dream last night, but we can talk
00:55:17 about that later.
00:55:18 I had a dream that I was eating a hamburger and I realized it had a bun on it and it was
00:55:23 made of bread and it had carbs in it.
00:55:25 Oh, no.
00:55:26 Let me tell you.
00:55:27 No, let me tell you.
00:55:28 I'm ashamed.
00:55:29 Is this just what this is going to be?
00:55:30 Is just dreams are cool?
00:55:31 Well, let's find out if it's cool or not.
00:55:33 I'm ashamed to admit that in the dream, I said, well, I already ate half of it.
00:55:39 I might as well...
00:55:40 No!
00:55:41 That's the kind of man I am.
00:55:43 I'm weak.
00:55:44 I know the feeling very much.
00:55:47 Oh, didn't we already do a PCP on dreams before?
00:55:51 Yeah, that's the thing.
00:55:52 I wasn't sure if we did.
00:55:53 I asked Nate and he said no.
00:55:55 Oh, if only there was a way to check me.
00:55:57 If only there was an incredibly simple way.
00:55:59 Look at the topics that we've covered up to this point.
00:56:01 Yeah, I see.
00:56:02 But what are we...
00:56:03 That requires...
00:56:04 That requires sleep and dreams.
00:56:05 Well, I'm not sure if I was on that one.
00:56:07 I probably was, but regardless, the thing is...
00:56:09 Talk about it again.
00:56:10 Yeah, the beauty about dreams is that you get them almost every night.
00:56:14 And for me specifically, I get several nights.
00:56:17 So, you know, it's a topic that will never die until I do.
00:56:21 Will you want to share one with us?
00:56:23 Yes.
00:56:24 I actually, funny enough, because it got pushed back the topic,
00:56:28 I managed to get this really cool dream a few days ago
00:56:33 that I wouldn't have been able to share it like last episode.
00:56:36 So lucky me.
00:56:37 So it was like...
00:56:38 Why?
00:56:39 These things don't make sense.
00:56:40 Don't nitpick it, because, I mean, it's a dream.
00:56:42 Sure.
00:56:43 But it was really cool, and I really hope I do a justice.
00:56:46 Okay, so a little bit of memory did fade from me,
00:56:49 so I don't remember where it starts.
00:56:51 My dreams to have a tendency to shift from one dream to another.
00:56:55 That's what dreams tend to be like.
00:56:56 Yeah.
00:56:57 Yeah, so this specific scenario starts with me being a military soldier,
00:57:02 and I wasn't mage.
00:57:04 I was this soldier guy.
00:57:06 And we were in this building.
00:57:10 It was kind of like a warehouse, but it was huge.
00:57:14 Imagine the biggest hospital you've ever seen,
00:57:17 and just that hospital being hollow in a warehouse.
00:57:21 That's how big and wide.
00:57:22 It's huge.
00:57:24 There's no floors between the things.
00:57:27 It's just very high, hollow.
00:57:30 And within that warehouse,
00:57:32 there was like a sort of like almost like a maze-like building,
00:57:37 and we were taking cover in it.
00:57:39 This is, by the way, in post-apocalyptic sort of scenario.
00:57:42 I'm just imagining the Angels of Death anime.
00:57:46 I have not seen it.
00:57:48 You would absolutely...
00:57:50 Well, first of all, have you played the game Angels of Death?
00:57:52 Because it seems like you're like...
00:57:54 It's like the most mage aesthetic thing I could possibly imagine.
00:57:58 The anime especially looks like your artwork, practically.
00:58:03 It's one of those indie horror games that RPG Maker horror games,
00:58:08 but it's got an anime adaptation now.
00:58:10 You should check it out.
00:58:12 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:58:13 Was it actually like an indie RPG Maker game that got an anime?
00:58:16 Yeah.
00:58:17 Holy shit.
00:58:18 It's like dope.
00:58:19 That's how that works in Japan, isn't it?
00:58:21 I mean, that's not...
00:58:23 I mean, RPG Maker specific is...
00:58:25 I mean, I'd imagine that's pretty rare.
00:58:27 I made an RPG Maker VX.
00:58:29 It is very popular, and that hasn't gotten an anime from what I've heard.
00:58:33 I mean, like, Angels of Death is very Ibsque.
00:58:36 I mean, it's possible that the creator of Ibsque didn't allow an anime to be made.
00:58:39 Shout out to Master of the Wind, the actual best RPG Maker RPG ever made.
00:58:44 I never played Master of the Wind.
00:58:47 You used to talk about Master of the Wind all the time.
00:58:49 And I had to make fan art that one time.
00:58:51 I drew that fire guy, whose name I forget.
00:58:55 Sometimes I think about...
00:58:56 I did a couple Master of the Wind pieces because you liked it so much,
00:58:59 and some of them were really bad, and I'm embarrassed about them.
00:59:02 Well, there you go.
00:59:03 But some of them were okay.
00:59:04 All right, mate.
00:59:05 Sorry.
00:59:06 Yeah, but back to the gym.
00:59:07 So I posted back to the faculty, it was exciting.
00:59:10 And so it was me, another soldier, and three old people bunkering down in the maze.
00:59:15 We were getting ready for a war, because we were going to get attacked by opposing forces of other humans.
00:59:20 And the thing is, we were not going to win this.
00:59:24 We knew that we were outmatched despite our mazes, despite our coverings,
00:59:28 despite everything, all the firepower we had.
00:59:31 We were not going to win this.
00:59:32 We were going to die.
00:59:33 All these people that were trying to save, all these people are hiding and covering or whatever.
00:59:37 There's only a few soldiers and a lot of civilians,
00:59:40 and we were not going to make it if this attack goes down.
00:59:43 So somehow I managed to sell my soul in exchange of winning this war, or rather this battle.
00:59:53 However, it had to be conditional.
00:59:55 I couldn't just snap my fingers and win.
00:59:57 I had to win it with the way this force tells me to win.
01:00:02 And if I don't do it, I lose my soul and I lose the war.
01:00:06 I lose out.
01:00:07 However, I took the risk regardless.
01:00:09 And what I had to do, I had to sort of like quote unquote back step one on my own
01:00:14 and kill them in front of this specific guy from the opposing forces.
01:00:18 And if that person dies, then the war is over, basically,
01:00:22 and the truce is had, peace is had.
01:00:25 So I did what I had to do.
01:00:27 I killed the guy.
01:00:28 No, no, wait, hold on.
01:00:30 So the forces come in and they start shooting at us,
01:00:33 and they even went on top of the, what do you call it, the scaffolding, I think, that's the thing.
01:00:42 On top of the building, they uncovered the building.
01:00:45 They were shooting us from top down.
01:00:48 And I wasn't getting hit, but I killed several of them.
01:00:51 I got a few headshots.
01:00:52 That was cool.
01:00:54 Wow, you're so good at this mate.
01:00:56 It's incredible.
01:00:57 Wow, I know, right?
01:00:59 So the forces went in, and the reason I couldn't just immediately do it,
01:01:06 is because I had to have a specific guy come in and walk into a certain position.
01:01:11 So we had to take some damage.
01:01:12 But once the guy was in,
01:01:14 so I killed one of our own.
01:01:16 And once the guy was dead,
01:01:19 the big boss guy called off the forces and was like,
01:01:22 okay, you know, whatever the truce.
01:01:25 During the battle, though, one of the old guys
01:01:29 that we were protecting,
01:01:31 his heart stopped, I think,
01:01:34 and they were trying to resuscitate.
01:01:36 What's the word, resuscitate?
01:01:38 Resuscitate, yeah.
01:01:39 Yeah, they were trying to resuscitate.
01:01:40 And I was like, okay, let me do it.
01:01:42 But I'm going to try, because I have plot armor,
01:01:45 and I'm the protagonist.
01:01:46 I should be able to do this, right?
01:01:48 So I went in there and I tried my best.
01:01:51 All I could manage was give that guy one last breath to open his eyes,
01:01:54 and that came out creepier.
01:01:56 I was like, I can save the guy.
01:01:58 And I was really sad.
01:02:00 I was heart torn.
01:02:01 Old people dying is the saddest thing to me.
01:02:04 And so it was very...
01:02:06 Even for a lot of sadness, I'm afraid.
01:02:08 It was heartbreaking.
01:02:11 But we had no time to mourn,
01:02:13 because of the whole the ruckus.
01:02:15 Ah, yes, the ruckus.
01:02:17 Yeah, all the ruckus.
01:02:19 The telltale ruckus.
01:02:21 Because of all the noise we created through the wars.
01:02:24 Like, the zombies were moving it,
01:02:26 because, like I said, it's not class apocalyptic unless they're zombies.
01:02:29 So the zombies were moving it,
01:02:31 and we had to evacuate.
01:02:33 But thankfully, zombies are slow,
01:02:35 so we could evacuate in an orderly fashion.
01:02:37 And we would...
01:02:40 It was very easy to do.
01:02:42 They were not a threat.
01:02:44 Zombies are never a threat in my dreams,
01:02:46 even though in all my apocalyptic dreams...
01:02:48 How often are zombies in your dreams?
01:02:50 Very often, actually.
01:02:52 See, I finished watching The Walking Dead a while ago.
01:02:57 So like ever since,
01:02:59 and even a bit before that,
01:03:01 like ever since and a bit before that,
01:03:03 I get these apocalyptic dreams.
01:03:05 They are varied in setting.
01:03:07 Not all of them have zombies.
01:03:09 Some of them do.
01:03:11 Zombies are rarely a threat.
01:03:13 They're just sort of in the background.
01:03:15 So like, yeah, we were moving out,
01:03:17 and then me, this other soldier guy,
01:03:19 and this doctor lady,
01:03:21 we had to sort of like separate from the group,
01:03:23 because, you know, I kind of killed one of my own.
01:03:25 And even though I did it to win the war,
01:03:27 people wouldn't necessarily know that,
01:03:29 so I kind of, you know, had to high tail it out of there.
01:03:32 So we started to move,
01:03:34 and this other lady that's starting following us,
01:03:36 and she was from the opposing forces,
01:03:38 and I know that she was able to manipulate water,
01:03:41 like some sort of waterbender or whatever.
01:03:43 And she was very dangerous,
01:03:45 and the fact that she was tailing us,
01:03:47 even though she was trying to play it cool,
01:03:49 like she wasn't tailing us,
01:03:51 oh, she's just traveling in the same direction,
01:03:53 was kind of like sketchy.
01:03:55 And then like,
01:03:57 so we ducked into this like shady hotel sort of thing,
01:03:59 where we met with another soldier
01:04:01 that wasn't there.
01:04:03 And he was on our side,
01:04:05 but he wasn't there for the battle.
01:04:07 And apparently,
01:04:09 the person I killed,
01:04:11 it was his best friend,
01:04:13 and when he learned
01:04:15 the best friend had died.
01:04:17 Oh, talk about awkward.
01:04:19 He didn't necessarily know that I killed him,
01:04:21 but he learned that he had to die,
01:04:23 like, and he decided,
01:04:25 and because of a traitor,
01:04:27 he decided to go find the traitor,
01:04:29 and like, he also had some sort of powers as well,
01:04:31 but if he had to,
01:04:33 but if he didn't do it,
01:04:35 it would undo my wish,
01:04:37 and my soul would just go to waste,
01:04:39 you know, because the world will start all over again,
01:04:41 and I wouldn't be able to,
01:04:43 you know, do it again,
01:04:45 so I had to go after the guy
01:04:47 to stop him
01:04:49 from doing whatever he was going to do,
01:04:51 and I remember like the last part of my dream was like,
01:04:53 he was in this pod,
01:04:55 and he was about to activate the pod
01:04:57 to do something, like teleport or whatever,
01:04:59 and like, I slammed open the door,
01:05:01 I reached into the pod,
01:05:03 I was like,
01:05:05 the handout is like, you know,
01:05:07 come with me, I'll show you the truth
01:05:09 or something like that,
01:05:11 and then the dream ended.
01:05:13 Alright.
01:05:15 I checked, we have not done a PCP on Dream,
01:05:17 but we have done a PCP on Sleep,
01:05:19 in which we explicitly say
01:05:21 how much we did.
01:05:23 I also did that same research.
01:05:25 Well,
01:05:27 I always like talking about dreams,
01:05:29 and I'm, you find what's interesting.
01:05:31 Have you heard this phrase,
01:05:33 have you heard the expression
01:05:35 that dreams are incredibly interesting
01:05:37 only to the person telling the story
01:05:39 of their dream?
01:05:41 No, because I want to hear about other people's dreams,
01:05:43 and I always find it fascinating.
01:05:45 Well, sure, sure.
01:05:47 Well, one time,
01:05:49 I think I've probably told the story
01:05:51 on the Sleep episode,
01:05:53 but I haven't.
01:05:55 If I could get,
01:05:57 the story doesn't mean anything to me,
01:05:59 but like, if it possibly,
01:06:01 like, all my dreams have
01:06:03 very clear meanings,
01:06:05 like, they're all shit, they're all nightmares,
01:06:07 they all suck, and I hate them,
01:06:09 but like, it's pretty easy
01:06:11 for me to extrapolate what they're about,
01:06:13 because almost all of them are-
01:06:15 Oh wait, sorry, that was just real life,
01:06:17 my mistake, I confused the two sometimes.
01:06:19 All of my dreams are just about me
01:06:21 being lost in a big place,
01:06:23 with people and or trying to protect
01:06:25 someone, so like,
01:06:27 they're all like direct responses
01:06:29 to things that are going on in my life
01:06:31 or my general mind state,
01:06:33 it's usually obvious,
01:06:35 and they're all basically the same,
01:06:37 they follow the same few templates,
01:06:39 so like, it sounds like you have a lot of dreams
01:06:41 where there's zombies and shit,
01:06:43 but they're not a threat,
01:06:45 so like, I don't know,
01:06:47 do you think that this has anything to say
01:06:49 about you personally?
01:06:51 Not really, okay, I have two types of dreams,
01:06:53 at least I categorize into two types of dreams,
01:06:55 one dreams where I am mage,
01:06:57 like, in real life self,
01:06:59 and one where I'm not mage,
01:07:01 which is basically what this dream was
01:07:03 and a lot of my coolest, my awesomeest,
01:07:05 my most badass dreams are when
01:07:07 I'm not my real self,
01:07:09 like, I could be like, quote unquote,
01:07:11 the mage. Okay, see that sounds like
01:07:13 it says something about you that maybe you
01:07:15 think that the only way you could be awesome
01:07:17 is by escaping
01:07:19 and not thinking of yourself
01:07:21 as yourself.
01:07:23 But isn't the only way
01:07:25 to detain if something's cool or not
01:07:27 is if you haven't done it already,
01:07:29 like, if you're just going to be yourself
01:07:31 in any dream, do anything that you've normally done
01:07:33 that's never going to be cool.
01:07:35 Well, it depends on if you think yourself is cool.
01:07:37 No, I love myself, that's no secret.
01:07:39 Yeah, woo!
01:07:41 So like, if you don't like yourself,
01:07:43 then any time you would see yourself
01:07:45 doing something awesome in a dream,
01:07:47 like being you.
01:07:49 It's like an experience of like
01:07:51 playing a game or role-playing something
01:07:53 like that, like experiencing an experience,
01:07:55 you know, in a safe environment.
01:07:57 And I like that.
01:07:59 I like those dreams, they're very fun.
01:08:01 When I have dreams about me being me,
01:08:03 it's usually like callbacks to the past
01:08:05 and the people that I don't want to remember
01:08:07 and it's like, it's nagging me
01:08:09 about things that I don't want
01:08:11 to think about or talk about
01:08:13 or want to move past, like a lot of my dreams
01:08:15 are like me, always have me
01:08:17 being back at school
01:08:19 during those years that I dreaded the most
01:08:21 and I hate that.
01:08:23 It's a callback, I guess it was
01:08:25 traumatic to me or something.
01:08:27 Yeah, it's unresolved trauma.
01:08:29 I think dreams for the most part
01:08:31 are just like things,
01:08:33 they're attempting, it's your brain
01:08:35 attempting to understand the things
01:08:37 that it doesn't understand,
01:08:39 but like it doesn't,
01:08:41 it's showing you these images
01:08:43 of you at all, it's like it's trying to help itself.
01:08:45 It's trying to like put things in their place
01:08:47 and like in my dreams I always see,
01:08:49 I always see random
01:08:51 faces and locations
01:08:53 that I have been to or like people I have known,
01:08:55 but they're not accurate.
01:08:57 Like the relationships
01:08:59 and the scenarios are not accurate
01:09:01 to what those people really were, but it's like
01:09:03 there's a reason that these people
01:09:05 are here and that this scenario is here.
01:09:07 It's just that that reason is jumbled.
01:09:09 It doesn't have a clear, coherent meaning,
01:09:11 but like through looking at the broad scope
01:09:13 of all the dreams put together,
01:09:15 I can figure out broadly what they're about.
01:09:17 You know, like the fact that
01:09:19 most of my dreams end with me
01:09:21 literally being on the run
01:09:23 from like a massive group of people
01:09:25 is like obviously I am afraid
01:09:27 of society coming after me.
01:09:29 Like that is something I've always been dealing with.
01:09:31 Are you a lucid dreamer, Digid?
01:09:33 No.
01:09:35 If I figure out that it's a dream,
01:09:37 most of my dreams end with me dying.
01:09:39 Like most of them end when
01:09:41 or are about to die or like surrounded
01:09:43 or trapped. Like my dreams usually
01:09:45 end when it reaches the point where
01:09:47 I am fully
01:09:49 Yeah, exactly. It's when I
01:09:51 reach the point of having the least control
01:09:53 and like I usually am straight up
01:09:55 immobilized or like about to die
01:09:57 and that's when I wake up.
01:09:59 I...
01:10:01 All my dreams are nightmares about either
01:10:03 I can't find...
01:10:05 It's all about I can't accomplish something.
01:10:07 I am lost and I can't find my way.
01:10:09 Or other people do not
01:10:11 want to assist me in doing something.
01:10:13 Mine are often about being lost but specifically
01:10:15 being left behind.
01:10:17 It's that I'm trying to catch up to the other
01:10:19 people who I was with before.
01:10:21 Yeah, I have a lot of those
01:10:23 dreams as well.
01:10:25 That's sad.
01:10:27 I don't think I dream that much.
01:10:29 I don't have that many
01:10:31 or I don't remember most of mine.
01:10:33 Like I remember that hamburger
01:10:35 dream.
01:10:37 I hadn't had one in a while.
01:10:39 It's a very exciting dream though.
01:10:41 It's a very straight forward dream too.
01:10:43 I think I feel like what I know
01:10:45 what that one's about. I was just dreaming about
01:10:47 eating and then I noticed that I was eating bread
01:10:49 and I was like, ah shit, oh well.
01:10:51 And that's the story.
01:10:53 I had another one like not that long ago
01:10:55 and I...
01:10:57 Your dreams are all just keto nightmares.
01:10:59 That's all you're having is keto nightmares.
01:11:01 It's been one thing now.
01:11:03 Yeah, that's it.
01:11:05 That's the only one I can remember
01:11:07 in recent memories.
01:11:09 Wasn't the other one also about eating a burger
01:11:11 or something?
01:11:13 That's the same one that I was just talking about.
01:11:15 I have a question about your dreams.
01:11:17 We've all expressed our displeasure
01:11:19 with this dream about dreams.
01:11:21 I love this.
01:11:23 You guys can leave.
01:11:25 I want to talk about dreams.
01:11:27 I have a question.
01:11:29 Have you attempted or
01:11:31 has there ever been a scenario
01:11:33 whenever you were chased?
01:11:35 Have you ever turned around
01:11:37 and asked them why they're chasing you?
01:11:39 Uh, no.
01:11:41 Because I know why they're chasing you.
01:11:43 There's a movie.
01:11:45 He knows what he did.
01:11:47 Exactly what I did.
01:11:49 What's the movie?
01:11:51 Why MS review a movie where that happens?
01:11:53 Where like the kid...
01:11:55 Wait, no. That's what happens in Stranger Things.
01:11:57 Stranger Things Season 2.
01:11:59 Bob tells the kid
01:12:01 next time you have a dream about the thing
01:12:03 turn around and tell it you're not afraid of it
01:12:05 and then he does that and it fucking murders him
01:12:07 and he gets fucked up and everything's ruined.
01:12:09 The reason I asked is because
01:12:11 I had a similar dream.
01:12:13 Spoilers, bitches!
01:12:15 I had a similar dream when I was younger
01:12:17 and some scary force
01:12:19 was chasing me
01:12:21 and I had no idea why.
01:12:23 I think it was like a witch but not like a humanoid
01:12:25 witch. It was terrifying.
01:12:27 It had me cornered
01:12:29 and I had no clue
01:12:31 why it was chasing me so I turned around
01:12:33 and it was like, why the fuck are you chasing me?
01:12:35 And it just got stumped.
01:12:37 And I woke up.
01:12:39 You stumped it?
01:12:41 Yeah, I stumped it.
01:12:43 It didn't attack me.
01:12:45 I was like, what the fuck are you chasing me?
01:12:47 What's your problem?
01:12:49 I woke up.
01:12:51 That's how you deal with a bully mage for sure.
01:12:53 I don't have necessarily nightmares.
01:12:55 Whenever scary things happen
01:12:57 I usually interpret it as
01:12:59 like, holy cow,
01:13:01 that's some cool shit happening.
01:13:03 Or like, I lose a dream
01:13:05 and then I just sort of like
01:13:07 bonk it on the head and it goes away.
01:13:09 My nightmares are usually
01:13:11 when I'm completely alone
01:13:13 in a completely empty town
01:13:15 and no one's there
01:13:17 and I just wander alone
01:13:19 and something's there.
01:13:21 I never see it. It's some sort of unknown force.
01:13:23 And it's
01:13:25 the patriarch
01:13:27 lurking behind every shadow.
01:13:29 It scares the living crap out of me
01:13:31 in those dreams.
01:13:33 Yeah, sounds scary.
01:13:35 It's always there.
01:13:37 Being alone is one of the scariest things
01:13:39 for me for sure.
01:13:41 The worst times is
01:13:43 if it's evening
01:13:45 and the lamps are on
01:13:47 the street lamps are on
01:13:49 and it's evening
01:13:51 and the lamps are a source of light
01:13:53 but everything else is getting darker
01:13:55 and growing darker and it's like
01:13:57 that sort of emptiness.
01:13:59 That's the only thing that sort of scares me
01:14:01 in my dreams nowadays.
01:14:03 Everything else is just like, oh, well, that was cool.
01:14:05 So...
01:14:07 That's cool.
01:14:09 Like I said before, I don't dream often
01:14:11 but I had a particularly vibrant dream
01:14:13 last night that stuck with me.
01:14:15 Good timing.
01:14:17 Yeah, it was good timing.
01:14:19 Yeah, quickly.
01:14:21 So, I don't know how I got here.
01:14:23 No, don't.
01:14:25 Well, I don't know what the situation was
01:14:27 but something was going on
01:14:29 with Michelle
01:14:31 where she was doing a fashion show
01:14:33 or something
01:14:35 and she had weird dreads
01:14:37 like Kerrigan from Starcraft 1
01:14:39 and
01:14:41 she was wearing this purple dress
01:14:43 and I was in the crowd watching this on stage
01:14:45 and she was going out with a bunch of other people
01:14:47 doing stuff
01:14:49 and I don't know, it was like
01:14:51 some celebration of her
01:14:53 and she had done something like
01:14:55 maybe it was her quinceanera
01:14:57 I don't know.
01:14:59 Yeah, that's the one.
01:15:01 I don't know what it was
01:15:03 but it was something going on celebrating her
01:15:05 and I was watching from the crowd
01:15:07 and feeling slightly uncomfortable
01:15:09 about the whole affair.
01:15:11 The only reason it sounds like that
01:15:13 if you're someone who doesn't generally have dreams
01:15:15 is it's all about Michelle.
01:15:17 It's obviously because you now have a new element
01:15:19 in your life that you have to
01:15:21 now reconcile in your brain.
01:15:23 Well, newer.
01:15:25 Well, I don't want to get personal
01:15:27 but we've been talking about
01:15:29 just some real shit recently
01:15:31 so my thoughts are that it's probably relevant to that.
01:15:33 I had a long period
01:15:35 of not really having any dreams
01:15:37 when me and May first started dating
01:15:39 it kind of had quelled
01:15:41 my nightmares for a while
01:15:43 and after things that happened last month
01:15:45 I have non-stop had nightmares
01:15:47 about people trying to take her away
01:15:49 from me and me having to save her
01:15:51 all the time.
01:15:53 People just kidnapping her in a literal
01:15:55 burlap sack and me having to
01:15:57 beat the shit out of them.
01:15:59 Did you pull off the mask of the kidnappers
01:16:01 next time and see that it is in fact May
01:16:03 under that. She is the kidnapper of herself.
01:16:05 Whoa.
01:16:07 And think about what that means.
01:16:09 Deep.
01:16:11 I have a silly dream.
01:16:13 In my dream
01:16:15 Digi was doing something
01:16:17 outrageously
01:16:19 silly and
01:16:21 he just one stop.
01:16:23 Nate was doing his padded
01:16:25 Registeel impersonation.
01:16:27 Not normal Registeel, but the Registeel that was removed.
01:16:29 It looked too much like a Nazi salute.
01:16:31 I want to see that.
01:16:33 Over and over and over again.
01:16:35 Yeah, Google search Registeel.
01:16:37 I named my Registeel that I caught
01:16:39 in a Pokemon Go Auschwitz.
01:16:41 I used to have dreams about
01:16:43 being out of my relationship
01:16:45 and that was great and then when I was out of it
01:16:47 I had nightmares that I was
01:16:49 not out of it and that leaving it
01:16:51 was in fact a dream
01:16:53 and that was terrifying and I would wake up
01:16:55 to great relief.
01:16:57 That's my dream story.
01:16:59 I just want to point out that the
01:17:01 thing that makes Registeel seem
01:17:03 so horrible is just that he is
01:17:05 holding up his left hand
01:17:07 kind of forward.
01:17:09 Sort of like a salute.
01:17:11 It does look like a Nazi salute.
01:17:13 It wasn't intentional.
01:17:15 I'm pretty sure.
01:17:17 No, I'm sure it wasn't.
01:17:19 I'm sure it was just the only dynamic pose
01:17:21 they could come up with
01:17:23 with such a fucking
01:17:25 horrible close design.
01:17:27 Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.
01:17:29 Hey Digi, last episode
01:17:31 I was talking about my trip to Italy
01:17:33 and I had a conversation
01:17:35 and I posted in the real friend initiative chat
01:17:37 which is in the PCP discord
01:17:39 about
01:17:41 city planning.
01:17:43 What you like to talk about city planning is I alluded to this last episode as well
01:17:45 because I have some big
01:17:47 ideas and big thoughts
01:17:49 and I have a PowerPoint presentation for you
01:17:51 about something in Italy.
01:17:53 Go ahead dude, I'm curious.
01:17:55 I love city planning.
01:17:57 I don't know if we can talk about this on PCP at all
01:17:59 but you and me
01:18:01 Didn't we have a whole city planning
01:18:03 discussion on one of these episodes?
01:18:05 Wasn't that like the first formless cast?
01:18:07 You might have, but I might have been gone.
01:18:09 I'm pretty sure on the first formless cast
01:18:11 it was like a massive city planning discussion.
01:18:13 Sure, okay.
01:18:15 And I thought you were a part of it.
01:18:17 If that is the case, then that is the case.
01:18:19 I was not.
01:18:21 I don't remember.
01:18:23 Well, whatever. In any case,
01:18:25 me and you have been thinking about sea planning a lot.
01:18:27 And going to Boston
01:18:29 was the first time that I ever thought about this
01:18:31 in Boston so much and it's just a well-designed city
01:18:33 that I started to come up with ideas.
01:18:35 I started to come up with, I started to concoct
01:18:37 buzzwords in my head.
01:18:39 What makes a good city?
01:18:41 And so I came up with some several buzzwords here.
01:18:43 Dense, easily navigatable
01:18:45 and then another one that I forgot.
01:18:47 You can cut out a syllable.
01:18:49 That's even one word. That's true.
01:18:51 Ooh, very nice.
01:18:53 Those are some buzzwords.
01:18:55 I know what makes a good city now.
01:18:57 I know.
01:18:59 It's navigatable.
01:19:01 And so you go to Italy and Rome.
01:19:03 Rome specifically.
01:19:05 And you think, okay, on paper,
01:19:07 it's very, very dense
01:19:09 and you can navigate it.
01:19:11 But here's the thing.
01:19:13 Rome is Rome
01:19:15 and it's been rebuilt on top of itself
01:19:17 a thousand times over a thousand years.
01:19:19 They did it once a year.
01:19:21 You get some crazy shit.
01:19:23 Yeah, once a year.
01:19:25 It's all demolished.
01:19:27 The exact same city but slightly different.
01:19:29 Well, yeah.
01:19:31 It's something like 2000 or something.
01:19:33 I don't know.
01:19:35 The Roman Empire was well-established
01:19:37 2000 years ago when Jesus was around.
01:19:39 But whatever.
01:19:41 Anyway, so here's the thing about Rome.
01:19:43 It's super dense.
01:19:45 You can walk down a Roman road
01:19:47 and walk down a block
01:19:49 or so. They don't really have blocks.
01:19:51 They don't have arcans.
01:19:53 A street.
01:19:55 Hundreds upon hundreds of stores.
01:19:57 It's just so packed.
01:19:59 But the thing about Rome is
01:20:01 is that the streets.
01:20:03 The streets in particular.
01:20:05 Imagine a back alleyway in America.
01:20:07 Imagine, you know, you see a space
01:20:09 in between two stores
01:20:11 where they keep like a dumpster or something.
01:20:13 The size of that back alleyway
01:20:15 are the size of the main streets
01:20:17 in Rome.
01:20:19 So there are no big open streets
01:20:21 the way we as Americans would think of them.
01:20:23 There are only
01:20:25 exclusively
01:20:27 back alleyways that go
01:20:29 in between buildings.
01:20:31 Very narrow, narrow streets
01:20:33 where you literally have to like dodge
01:20:35 people or if you're a person
01:20:37 dodge multiple cars.
01:20:39 When they built these alleys
01:20:41 they would not have been cars.
01:20:43 Well, sure.
01:20:45 That's the case
01:20:47 for Boston as well.
01:20:49 They've adjusted
01:20:51 and they've planned for wagons and stuff.
01:20:53 But the streets are so fucking dense in Rome
01:20:55 that you can barely
01:20:57 it's feel like you're driving.
01:20:59 It's like you're claustrophobic because you're just surrounded by
01:21:01 on either side of you
01:21:03 towering buildings. Like no matter how
01:21:05 many stores are actually in each building
01:21:07 it's always three stories.
01:21:09 It's really bizarre, I've noticed this.
01:21:11 They're all three stories. So you're gonna have a shop
01:21:13 on the first level and then just literally
01:21:15 nothing on the top like, you know, two
01:21:17 and three levels. And they're just there
01:21:19 because I don't know, they used to be residential
01:21:21 back in the medieval times.
01:21:23 So you have these towering buildings on either side of you
01:21:25 for just miles. And there's no
01:21:27 like, especially in Rome
01:21:29 where there's so much history and architecture
01:21:31 and you know, oh, you can just walk and see the Charlie Fountain.
01:21:33 The Charlie Fountain is this view
01:21:35 like, you know, huge majestic fountain
01:21:37 that's like a staple of Italy culture
01:21:39 you know, it's on your postcards.
01:21:41 It just is in some
01:21:43 bum-fuck alley. You could just walk
01:21:45 accidentally, like stumble upon this
01:21:47 huge tourist destination
01:21:49 without even trying to. There's no
01:21:51 like, space for it. It just is
01:21:53 in the, like, a one by one
01:21:55 block where a normal
01:21:57 building would be. It's like, oh, it's just this
01:21:59 giant, beautiful fountain.
01:22:01 It's so dense and it's
01:22:03 over-expense. Like, it's so hard to get around it.
01:22:05 Let me pause at something. I think that the problem
01:22:07 with cities like Rome is that
01:22:09 you build the perfect city
01:22:11 and it's beautiful and everyone loves it
01:22:13 so everyone moves there
01:22:15 and then immediately it is no longer
01:22:17 the perfect city because
01:22:19 I agree, Digi, build the wall. Keep them out.
01:22:21 That's what we gotta do. You just need to build
01:22:23 more cities. We just need
01:22:25 there to be, like, every time we hit
01:22:27 the cap where, like, the city doesn't make
01:22:29 sense anymore, do another one. And I understand
01:22:31 why that wouldn't have been possible
01:22:33 at a time where you had to build your city
01:22:35 somewhere that made, like, strategic sense
01:22:37 for, like, combat as well as
01:22:39 for, like, you know, having enough water
01:22:41 and resources and everything. But, like, we've
01:22:43 spent the last 200 years making
01:22:45 that not an issue anymore. We
01:22:47 nobody lives next to a farm
01:22:49 now. Like, we don't have
01:22:51 to worry about the food being
01:22:53 nearby anymore. It comes by car. We
01:22:55 have aqueducts for the water. Even
01:22:57 the Romans invented that. You know, like,
01:22:59 there's ways and because
01:23:01 we don't have to worry about land fighting
01:23:03 anymore, like, there's not a thing.
01:23:05 So, like, whether or not it's a tactical
01:23:07 advantage to build your city here
01:23:09 totally irrelevant now. So, like,
01:23:11 there's probably shitloads of places
01:23:13 that just hadn't been considered places
01:23:15 where cities could be built before.
01:23:17 But, like, because
01:23:19 the big cities are self-perpetuating
01:23:21 hype machines, like, New York
01:23:23 City is constantly
01:23:25 hyping itself as
01:23:27 the place to go. And so, people are
01:23:29 going to go there, even though
01:23:31 it's a city that is
01:23:33 under constant construction
01:23:35 because there's so many people
01:23:37 that the needs of the city are constantly changing
01:23:39 and they're never met.
01:23:41 They're never realized, you know?
01:23:43 Did you know they recently, like,
01:23:45 like, stop granting
01:23:47 new Uber license? And they're going to, like,
01:23:49 have new laws limiting Uber
01:23:51 consumption because they are
01:23:53 running, like, taxis and they're
01:23:55 stuffing up the streets. That's, uh, that's
01:23:57 makes sense. I mean, like,
01:23:59 it's kind of like the, um,
01:24:01 the girl in the gun, like, person
01:24:03 limit thing, right? Where
01:24:05 he's like, there has to only be so many people
01:24:07 on earth or else it
01:24:09 becomes a problem. And the
01:24:11 argument from the
01:24:13 opposition is not so much, hey,
01:24:15 like, it's like, well
01:24:17 can we just find a way to make it
01:24:19 so we can keep expanding the population
01:24:21 and keep it under control and have it make
01:24:23 sense? And it's like, I feel like we haven't
01:24:25 we haven't found that answer
01:24:27 just yet. But, like, that's what we need
01:24:29 to be looking for. And until you have that, you ain't got nothing. Right.
01:24:31 You gotta find that first if you want to build more people
01:24:33 or whatever. Exactly. And, like, we need to
01:24:35 find the paradigm that makes sense. And I
01:24:37 think the problem is that no, not enough
01:24:39 people understand why
01:24:41 they want to go to the big city.
01:24:43 Like, yeah.
01:24:45 Oh, this goes back exactly
01:24:47 to, like, St. Helene
01:24:49 because you're supposed to go to St. Helene,
01:24:51 why do you want to go to New York?
01:24:53 It's New York. And you also
01:24:55 if you're from a small town,
01:24:57 like, uh, for instance
01:24:59 Virginia Beach is not necessarily a small city,
01:25:01 but it has no culture. It has no
01:25:03 nowhere to go if you're an artist. There's not, like,
01:25:05 like Victor, who's been, my brother Victor,
01:25:07 former guest in the PCP,
01:25:09 we all know who Victor is. We all know who Victor is.
01:25:11 He's been on the PCP. So Victor,
01:25:13 you know, he works in
01:25:15 film in Virginia Beach, which is a very small
01:25:17 industry. There's no, like, expansion
01:25:19 there. And so when he looks at the rest
01:25:21 of the world, it's like, where can I go
01:25:23 that I can make money doing film?
01:25:25 He thinks, like, okay, we got
01:25:27 Georgia because Atlanta
01:25:29 is a big film town. You got LA
01:25:31 and you got New York. And it's kind of like
01:25:33 from the perspective of someone living in Virginia Beach,
01:25:35 that's all there is.
01:25:37 Because that's all you hear about. But, like,
01:25:39 there are other places
01:25:41 and if not, you could even
01:25:43 build a place. Like,
01:25:45 my mentality was always like, hey,
01:25:47 let's just move all the people who we want
01:25:49 to work with here, and then we
01:25:51 have a place. Like, that's, you know,
01:25:53 the theory behind PCPHQ
01:25:55 and based on
01:25:57 the Red Letter Media guys who literally did that.
01:25:59 They've been fucking Milwaukee. Like, it's not a film city,
01:26:01 but they have a film career
01:26:03 there, you know. Granted,
01:26:05 they're not working in, you know, in the
01:26:07 big leagues, but, like,
01:26:09 they are able to produce full-blown indie
01:26:11 films on the basis of
01:26:13 their, like, 10 or 12-man
01:26:15 crew and whoever they can hire on board,
01:26:17 you know, to work with them in Milwaukee.
01:26:19 Yeah. Quick aside, quick
01:26:21 aside, but before we move on, I can see
01:26:23 the comments now. I just want to make
01:26:25 sure everyone on the same page is me.
01:26:27 I'm not saying that New York City is
01:26:29 Lean Tower of Pisa Tier, a.k.a. absolute shit.
01:26:31 Lean, uh, uh, New York City
01:26:33 is cool. It just is the same
01:26:35 sort of general idea where it's, like, people
01:26:37 would have the, they don't have a reason to go to New York City.
01:26:39 New York City, there are reasons to go there.
01:26:41 I would like to live in New York City.
01:26:43 I mean, I like Boston. I would like, I think I'd like
01:26:45 New York a lot as well. Yeah, and this, this whole
01:26:47 theory that I'm positing is why I ended
01:26:49 up in Boston, because when I was
01:26:51 in Virginia Beach, I was looking at all these cities that,
01:26:53 like, people recommended. I'm like, well, I don't know
01:26:55 what is supposed to be good
01:26:57 about these cities until I go there.
01:26:59 Like, I know Atlanta is supposed to have, like, a big
01:27:01 film scene, and it is, and a big rap scene,
01:27:03 and it's a big city, but then you go
01:27:05 there, and you realize that Atlanta is super
01:27:07 spread out, and it's really difficult to
01:27:09 get around, and it's, it's
01:27:11 dirty, and yeah, it's just like,
01:27:13 it's not a place that I looked
01:27:15 at, and went like, wow, this seems
01:27:17 like the dream, you know?
01:27:19 It was more like, and so,
01:27:21 and I went to Atlanta. Where was that? Atlanta.
01:27:23 Atlanta. Atlanta. Atlanta. Atlanta.
01:27:25 Uh, I like Atlanta, right?
01:27:27 It's, I mean, it's fine, but it's not
01:27:29 nearly like, when I came to,
01:27:31 like, when I came to Boston, this was a city
01:27:33 I had no concept of, like, I did not
01:27:35 know anything about Boston
01:27:37 at all until I came here,
01:27:39 but then when I looked at it, I was just like, oh,
01:27:41 this is exactly
01:27:43 what I was looking for,
01:27:45 because even though Boston's not known
01:27:47 for, like, a film scene, or this or
01:27:49 that, or like, for YouTubers being here, like,
01:27:51 I looked at it, and I went, well, this would
01:27:53 be a great place to do this job.
01:27:55 It's just a matter of
01:27:57 setting up perception. Yeah, setting up
01:27:59 something here, and like, there are already
01:28:01 other YouTubers who live here, you know,
01:28:03 right at the gate got to hang out with
01:28:05 Zenn Huckstable, who's super cool, and I'd love to work with
01:28:07 them, you know, and like, Tom and Ben were already
01:28:09 here, and it's just like,
01:28:11 this can make sense.
01:28:13 It's just a matter of actually
01:28:15 going to the city, looking at the resources
01:28:17 that are available here, and saying, what can we
01:28:19 build here, as opposed to like, what is there
01:28:21 already infrastructure for, because if
01:28:23 you go to L.A. or New York, where
01:28:25 everyone else is going to have a film career,
01:28:27 guess what is going to be the most competitive
01:28:29 market there, is
01:28:31 going to be the film career, which is why, you know,
01:28:33 everyone goes to L.A. and fucking works in cafes
01:28:35 for 15 years while they try to play the screenplay.
01:28:37 We can be big fish in the small pond. Right, exactly.
01:28:39 But the thing
01:28:41 is, there should not be, like, regardless
01:28:43 of, regardless
01:28:45 of like, the big fish small pond dichotomy kind
01:28:47 of thing, it's more like, what everyone should do is
01:28:49 think about
01:28:51 what kind of fish you want to be, and what kind
01:28:53 of pond you want to live in,
01:28:55 you know, like, it's not just about being
01:28:57 a big fish in a small pond, it's like, this
01:28:59 is a pond that suits my
01:29:01 needs, and so regardless of how big I am
01:29:03 as a fish, like, I would like to
01:29:05 live in this pond, and like, let's
01:29:07 find an ecosystem where it makes sense
01:29:09 for you to live in, you know.
01:29:11 There's no reason to stick with this metaphor.
01:29:13 I can make it work.
01:29:15 It's fine.
01:29:17 There's no, it does not impact.
01:29:19 It's not the same. Anyway, yeah, I just think
01:29:21 I think we need
01:29:23 I think the only answer to, like, fixing cities
01:29:25 is to build new cities, like
01:29:27 it's not to try to keep building over
01:29:29 the ones we already have, it's like
01:29:31 we need to just go out and find a place
01:29:33 where we can build, like, an ideal city
01:29:35 for a certain type of person
01:29:37 and then get that type of person
01:29:39 to come there, and then, like,
01:29:41 just, you know, be like, hey, here, here's
01:29:43 a spot for you if you think like me,
01:29:45 you know, and for those
01:29:47 of us
01:29:49 on the autistic spectrum, we need
01:29:51 to build an autism city.
01:29:53 It's basically what I'm saying, and that's my
01:29:55 dream right now, is to build
01:29:57 the autism city.
01:29:59 Beautiful, beautiful.
01:30:01 You should definitely learn,
01:30:03 we talked about this a little bit in chat, did you, but you should definitely
01:30:05 look into the actual specifics of
01:30:07 the plan for Epcot, because it is
01:30:09 the most autistic thing I've ever
01:30:11 heard, like, everything is, like, perfect circles
01:30:13 and, like, it's shaped to be, like,
01:30:15 it looks like a cell. It's very
01:30:17 interesting. Have you guys
01:30:19 ever played table?
01:30:21 I'm planning, me and Tom,
01:30:23 let me just, let me just launch
01:30:25 this right now, me and Tom got a new channel
01:30:27 called I Am Games,
01:30:29 which we also have a t-shirt, we've already sold
01:30:31 five t-shirts on the basis of one
01:30:33 tweet, so this is
01:30:35 already happening, and our
01:30:37 first videos and our first live streams
01:30:39 are going to be about fable, so
01:30:41 there you go, what a coincidence.
01:30:43 Yeah, that's a good one, okay, like, the reason.
01:30:45 I've never played a fable game.
01:30:47 Well, you're going to learn all about them
01:30:49 on I Am Games!
01:30:51 Go to
01:30:53 imgames.fun right now,
01:30:55 and it links to our YouTube channel.
01:30:57 Are you kidding me? No, I own
01:30:59 imgames.fun, links to the
01:31:01 YouTube channel I Am Games.
01:31:03 Wait, why did you
01:31:05 get a custom URL?
01:31:07 I am very serious about this t-shirts
01:31:09 thing.
01:31:11 I'm very fucking serious, I was just
01:31:13 looking up trademarks for a second ago,
01:31:15 and I found out that as long as you just put
01:31:17 a TM next to your shit, you basically
01:31:19 have a common law trademark, and if you can
01:31:21 prove that, like, you were the first one to do
01:31:23 that, then you can
01:31:25 back yourself up in a court of law, so
01:31:27 I'm officially announcing
01:31:29 that I own the trademark to the phrase
01:31:31 I Am Games, so there you go.
01:31:33 This is the statement.
01:31:35 What is the relevance of I Am Games?
01:31:37 You own the trademark,
01:31:39 you own the copyright, right?
01:31:41 No, I just, because I just said that, I now
01:31:43 have the common law trademark by saying that
01:31:45 just now on this podcast.
01:31:47 That's why I said it like that.
01:31:49 I just looked up the
01:31:51 laws just now while we were doing the show.
01:31:53 Like, I thought that, like, you have to apply for a
01:31:55 trademark. If you apply for it, if you
01:31:57 apply for the trademark, then
01:31:59 it is, like, in the system, and people can
01:32:01 look it up, but again,
01:32:03 the law of trademarking is just if you
01:32:05 say you own it enough times, then
01:32:07 like, you do.
01:32:09 Okay, okay, the reason I brought
01:32:11 up Fable, though,
01:32:13 is because, like, when I was
01:32:15 younger, I really wanted to build
01:32:17 like, a little town, like, I was like
01:32:19 when I grew up, I want to build a town, and
01:32:21 like, and the reason I brought up Fable is
01:32:23 because I was really, I really, really
01:32:25 loved Fable. At that time, it was
01:32:27 like, the first game I played on the
01:32:29 original Xbox, on my very first
01:32:31 console that I officially owned,
01:32:33 and I really liked
01:32:35 Bowerstone, and I was like, when I
01:32:37 grew up, I want to have a town just
01:32:39 like Bowerstone, and just, like,
01:32:41 a little bit cleaner, and
01:32:43 that was, that was my dream town
01:32:45 slash city sort of thing. I'm good
01:32:47 to be looking, when I play this game, I'm
01:32:49 going to be studying the city now that you've said that.
01:32:51 It's not good, it was
01:32:53 like, a nine-year-old
01:32:55 mage. I don't know, because Peter
01:32:57 Malinu is the kind of guy who probably would
01:32:59 like, involve pretty high-level city
01:33:01 planning into his games.
01:33:03 It's a very tiny town. Those were
01:33:05 Peter Malinu games, I forgot.
01:33:07 And there's this book
01:33:09 that I want to read called The Timeless Art
01:33:11 of Building, which is a, it's
01:33:13 fascinatingly structured, because it's like a full-size
01:33:15 book, but it's written in such a way that
01:33:17 if you were to just read all the
01:33:19 headlines, then you will get, like,
01:33:21 he wrote it so like, every paragraph has
01:33:23 a headline, and he's like, if you only have
01:33:25 an hour, just read all the headlines.
01:33:27 And all the other stuff is just, like, fill in
01:33:29 information. Basically, like, my compress, decompress
01:33:31 video is kind of structured the same way
01:33:33 as this book, which I didn't even fucking
01:33:35 realize until just now, but that's hilarious.
01:33:37 Yeah, but
01:33:39 he talks a lot about, like, the ways that
01:33:41 cities should be planned, such as, like,
01:33:43 taking a area, and instead
01:33:45 of building roads first,
01:33:47 just observing how
01:33:49 people traverse the area naturally,
01:33:51 and then building the roads in those
01:33:53 paths, and things like that.
01:33:55 Makes sense. Yeah. And just, you know,
01:33:57 there's lots of stuff about just the structure of stuff,
01:33:59 and then they built a campus
01:34:01 on the basis of his book, like,
01:34:03 his ideas to, like, test it out.
01:34:05 But the person who I look up to the most
01:34:07 for their stance on city planning is
01:34:09 Hayao Miyazaki, who
01:34:11 built the Ghibli Museum out of,
01:34:13 like,
01:34:15 his ideas about, like, what a perfect
01:34:17 environment should be, that, like,
01:34:19 for instance,
01:34:21 he has a whole poem he wrote about,
01:34:23 like, the principles that the museum was built
01:34:25 on, and, like, if you read this poem, it's just
01:34:27 like, oh, this is just how the whole world
01:34:29 should be structured. I mean, okay, that's cool
01:34:31 and all, but rather than look up to, like, an actual
01:34:33 city planner, you're looking up to a guy who built one
01:34:35 building. Well, it's because
01:34:37 think about how
01:34:39 a building is a microcosm.
01:34:41 You can look at his building as a
01:34:43 scale model of a city. It's
01:34:45 basically the way I'm looking at it. Okay.
01:34:47 No one has been able
01:34:49 to build the ultimate city, because
01:34:51 no one guy who imagines it is
01:34:53 going to then be able to go and fucking
01:34:55 build it, except for Disney's attempt
01:34:57 with the Epcot Center. But, like,
01:34:59 um, and Disney was
01:35:01 unfeasibly rich, you know, and, like,
01:35:03 had this kind of power, and had already
01:35:05 built Disney World, you know? If there's one
01:35:07 guy that could do it, it was going to be Walt Disney.
01:35:09 Right, exactly. And, like, I think the problem
01:35:11 is that these guys
01:35:13 don't do enough to inspire
01:35:15 other people to work with them.
01:35:17 Like, guys like Hayao Miyazaki,
01:35:19 who, I think that
01:35:21 a big part of what he has realized
01:35:23 in his old age, if you watch, like,
01:35:25 The Wind Rises, I think a lot of that movie
01:35:27 is about his guilt
01:35:29 over the fact that he tried to do everything
01:35:31 himself, that, like, he was so draconian
01:35:33 and so, like, oh, everything has
01:35:35 to be according to the letter of, like, my vision.
01:35:37 And, like, I think
01:35:39 that you're never going to get
01:35:41 enough people to build a city that way.
01:35:43 Like, you need to have people on board
01:35:45 with you, but also to, like, embrace
01:35:47 their ideas and to, like, evolve
01:35:49 the thing, you know? Like, so
01:35:51 I don't want to build a city based on, like, my
01:35:53 plan for a city. I want
01:35:55 to, like, communicate with
01:35:57 people and all of us come to an understanding
01:35:59 of what environment we want
01:36:01 and then set about figuring out how to build that
01:36:03 together, you know? So it's not so much that, like,
01:36:05 you know. Digi, let's just start
01:36:07 like a creative Minecraft. We should definitely
01:36:09 I mean, I think that's
01:36:11 basically what that exists for.
01:36:13 Like, I think a lot of these
01:36:15 a lot of
01:36:17 modern art is trying
01:36:19 to help people
01:36:21 to develop the mindsets that the people
01:36:23 who create the art have.
01:36:25 Like, I think that when Notch made a game
01:36:27 like Minecraft, there was
01:36:29 when he put in those tools, like, for instance
01:36:31 the red, um, the red, uh,
01:36:33 what's it fucking called? The redstone, whatever?
01:36:35 Yeah, the redstone. Like, it's just
01:36:37 teaching kids how to program.
01:36:39 Like, that's what it's there for, is to teach
01:36:41 you how to code, essentially, because it
01:36:43 is just, it's just literally built in
01:36:45 circuit boards. So, like, the reason
01:36:47 he puts this in the game is he's like, hey,
01:36:49 let's see what you can create if I gave you
01:36:51 a three-dimensional coding environment,
01:36:53 you know? Like, which is
01:36:55 even more, like, you can create things that you couldn't
01:36:57 just easily code in real life,
01:36:59 um, because
01:37:01 I mean, you could code it into a computer and then it could
01:37:03 be simulated there, but like, he gives you the means
01:37:05 to, like, literally just
01:37:07 lay down some redstone bricks and a thing
01:37:09 like, physically happens
01:37:11 in the reality of this game. And, like, you can
01:37:13 instantly see what would be the
01:37:15 results of if you duplicated this
01:37:17 in reality, but you would need all those materials.
01:37:19 Yeah, coding it in a computer would be too artificial.
01:37:21 But in Minecraft, you can do it, you can do it
01:37:23 for real. Again, it's... It really happens.
01:37:25 Yeah, pretty much. I mean, like...
01:37:27 No, I know it's... Because you'd have to build
01:37:29 the code of Minecraft first to even
01:37:31 have the visuals to simulate
01:37:33 the thing you're coding. Like, and for
01:37:35 kids, I think the abstraction
01:37:37 of just looking at a bunch of numbers is
01:37:39 why coding is hard. Like, you look
01:37:41 at a code and you're like, what the fuck does that
01:37:43 say? But, like, when you just lay down
01:37:45 redstone bricks and shit, and you look at
01:37:47 it, then it makes perfect sense, you know? Especially
01:37:49 when you can see what it activates.
01:37:51 So, I do think it's all just teaching...
01:37:53 I agree. My nephew has
01:37:55 like, a similar, like, sort of play kid
01:37:57 specifically for young children. And it has
01:37:59 like, stuff like, um,
01:38:01 with little electronics and stuff. So he can
01:38:03 build, like, a thing that he can sort of
01:38:05 make fly, or have, like, a little
01:38:07 light bulb light up. And it's, like, a very
01:38:09 sort of safe kid-friendly environment. And
01:38:11 like, he was like, fine when he
01:38:13 managed to build those things. He was very interested
01:38:15 and that's really neat.
01:38:17 Maybe like that Nintendo Labo is the same
01:38:19 sort of thing. I was about to talk about that.
01:38:21 Like, and a lot of the stuff... Like,
01:38:23 there's a reason Minecraft is so big in schools
01:38:25 that, like, it was adapted as, like,
01:38:27 this major teaching tool. Because, like,
01:38:29 I think that right now
01:38:31 most of, like, the
01:38:33 thought leaders in society are of the
01:38:35 mindset that, like, what we need the most is,
01:38:37 like, more engineers and more coders
01:38:39 and more people who can, like,
01:38:41 bring visions to life.
01:38:43 Because, like, right now we don't need
01:38:45 soldiers. We don't need, like,
01:38:47 we don't need people working factories, because
01:38:49 we can replace them with robots eventually.
01:38:51 Like, we actually kind of need soldiers, because
01:38:53 they're all, all people are too fat and we're
01:38:55 running low. That's true fact. That's true
01:38:57 fact. Well, we need to also make people
01:38:59 less fucking fat. That's part of the mission here.
01:39:01 But...
01:39:03 Like, Otaku Gonzo Journalism
01:39:05 Bro Thought Leader
01:39:07 In my book, I call myself
01:39:09 a prospective millennial
01:39:11 thought leader, I think. And D-List
01:39:13 D-List?
01:39:15 No, I think it was D-List Millennial
01:39:17 Thought Leader. Something like that. In any
01:39:19 case, like,
01:39:21 I do think that,
01:39:23 like, for instance, when
01:39:25 people talk about, like, the problem of robots
01:39:27 taking our jobs, right?
01:39:29 Like, robots taking people's jobs is only
01:39:31 a problem, because people don't know how to do
01:39:33 other jobs. Like, if
01:39:35 everyone knew... Imagine if we lived
01:39:37 in a world where everyone knew how to code.
01:39:39 Well, we have infinite coding jobs.
01:39:41 Like, if you just keep coming up with
01:39:43 new shit to code, that's fine.
01:39:45 Like, so if everyone who we had working
01:39:47 the factories was replaced with robots, and
01:39:49 then all those people just learned to code,
01:39:51 they would all have jobs. Like, we don't need
01:39:53 these factory jobs to exist, you know?
01:39:55 The thing about the robot jobs,
01:39:57 right? Like,
01:39:59 it makes me so mad. In a perfect world,
01:40:01 we would replace, like,
01:40:03 replacing jobs with robots should not
01:40:05 be a bad thing. No, never.
01:40:07 That should be what we want, but it's not
01:40:09 because people want their jobs, because people
01:40:11 want to work to make money.
01:40:13 But it's totally, but it's totally ridiculous,
01:40:15 because, like, that's not producing
01:40:17 any... Wanting to live.
01:40:19 The problem is that people aren't thinking... That's not producing any additional
01:40:21 value, it's just, like,
01:40:23 it's just the systems we have in place
01:40:25 demand labor, even though that labor
01:40:27 is not necessary. And it's a problem of people not
01:40:29 thinking generationally. Like, there's lots of jobs that just don't need to be done.
01:40:31 Like, these people are worried about the job,
01:40:33 like, I understand if you were,
01:40:35 like, a, you know, a 40-year-old
01:40:37 man, and you're getting your job taken away by a robot,
01:40:39 I understand why that would bother you, but it's, like,
01:40:41 the reason this job has to be taken by a robot
01:40:43 is so your kid doesn't have to
01:40:45 do this job when you're dead.
01:40:47 You know, like, your kid... Nobody ever
01:40:49 has to do it again. Right.
01:40:51 That's just a hefty toll to pay, which I...
01:40:53 I mean, that's the real problem. Like, we...
01:40:55 We're asking people to basically be sacrificed
01:40:57 on the altar of progress in, uh, in a fact.
01:40:59 Which we should be asking...
01:41:01 Because we don't have a system to support that, you know.
01:41:03 I would ask of those people who are, like,
01:41:05 working the factory job, like, why do you value
01:41:07 your life so much? You're just a fucking factory worker.
01:41:09 Like, get over yourself.
01:41:11 Just die and let the next generation
01:41:13 take over. You're...
01:41:15 No, you don't have to die.
01:41:17 The problem is they'll say the same for all of us in time.
01:41:19 No, and I agree. I think that my...
01:41:21 Like, my purpose is here to just
01:41:23 inspire the next generation, and then
01:41:25 when my ideas are so outdated
01:41:27 that I can't help anymore, just let me die.
01:41:29 Like... I think there's some wisdom to that.
01:41:31 I honestly do. You know, and that's why
01:41:33 I think... I think that's why there's so many
01:41:35 old people who just, like, fuck off to Florida.
01:41:37 Like, Florida is where you go
01:41:39 when you realize that you can't really
01:41:41 add anything to society anymore.
01:41:43 Like, just go to Florida and go, like,
01:41:45 just sit by the beach and look at the water
01:41:47 until you're out, you know?
01:41:49 I think that's... I think that's... I think I'm
01:41:51 glad I respect the old people
01:41:53 who have the dignity to just get out
01:41:55 of the way and fuck off to some
01:41:57 ass-backwards place like Florida
01:41:59 where it's, like, beautiful, but also
01:42:01 everyone's insane.
01:42:03 You know? God, I'm so
01:42:05 fucking immature. There are still...
01:42:07 I read them out most of the time,
01:42:09 but there are still times where I fear death.
01:42:11 I need... I need to...
01:42:13 I think it's... I think it's
01:42:15 fair to fear death, but it's just, like,
01:42:17 it's going to
01:42:19 come unless we can... unless
01:42:21 we have techno-singularity within
01:42:23 our lifetime, which I used to... that was the
01:42:25 only thing that kept me away from fearing death
01:42:27 before, was, like, oh, man,
01:42:29 I don't have to be afraid because
01:42:31 maybe, like, according to certain
01:42:33 projections, I might upload my consciousness
01:42:35 to a computer, but then, like, all the stuff
01:42:37 about that also informs you, like, hey, just so you
01:42:39 know, if you upload your consciousness collectively,
01:42:41 like, you cease to exist.
01:42:43 You just become... Right, you know,
01:42:45 you're just gonna melt into
01:42:47 the sea of information, and you, as a personal identity,
01:42:49 is no longer real, so it's...
01:42:51 I've pretty much given up hope.
01:42:53 Like, if I happen, my consciousness gets saved
01:42:55 in my lifetime, that's great, but I'm not gonna
01:42:57 back yet. I'm expecting to die.
01:42:59 I mean, how would you bank on that?
01:43:01 I'm not. I'm not.
01:43:05 Well, that's a good idea.
01:43:07 Well, like, what would you do differently?
01:43:09 What would you do differently at all
01:43:11 if you thought that one day your consciousness
01:43:13 was going to get in trouble?
01:43:15 If one could live one's life differently,
01:43:17 if you were banking on the expectation that you
01:43:19 would live forever, as opposed to expecting
01:43:21 to die and have to pass on, like,
01:43:23 your information memetic legacy,
01:43:25 as opposed to your physical presence
01:43:27 in the world, you know? You know what's made me comfortable
01:43:29 with death is that, like, I used to always say,
01:43:31 like, I want to upload my consciousness to a computer
01:43:33 and live forever, and people always ask, like, well,
01:43:35 what would you do if you live forever? Wouldn't you get bored?
01:43:37 And I'd be like, no, there's endless new information,
01:43:39 there's endless new art, but now that I've
01:43:41 recognized that basically all art is exactly
01:43:43 the same, and that it's, like, all basically sending
01:43:45 the same message, it's like, oh, well, I don't care
01:43:47 about consuming all of it anymore, like, you know?
01:43:49 Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of overlap for sure.
01:43:51 Yeah, so, not to mention the fact that...
01:43:53 You start to see the patterns. I imagine
01:43:55 as you get older and you see more and more art,
01:43:57 you start to see the patterns, it starts to look like,
01:43:59 it starts to be, like, cipher, looking at the code
01:44:01 of the matrix, you know? You see
01:44:03 the code behind it, and it just gets less
01:44:05 and less engaging, and then
01:44:07 you die. So, it's all good.
01:44:09 I think a lot of what keeps us going is
01:44:11 the wonderment of discovery of the world.
01:44:13 Like, I'm currently going through
01:44:15 the phase in my life right now, where I am
01:44:17 in wonderment at discovering the pleasures of
01:44:19 adulthood, which are the pleasures of childhood
01:44:21 are, like, a freedom
01:44:23 to do whatever you want with little to no
01:44:25 consequences, and have other people worry about
01:44:27 the details. The pleasures of adulthood are
01:44:29 taking ownership of your life and
01:44:31 taking control of your own destiny, and, like,
01:44:33 steering your ship where it wants to go.
01:44:35 But, like, once you've done that, there's
01:44:37 really, like, you, that's pretty much everything
01:44:39 there is. Like, you could become, like, an
01:44:41 adventurer or whatever. You could travel
01:44:43 to far distant places. But it takes constant effort to make it
01:44:45 happen, and that's the excitement of it. Is that, like...
01:44:47 I mean, yeah, that's right.
01:44:49 It is the journey. It is about the journey.
01:44:51 Our brains, you know, stop
01:44:53 growing pretty much by word 25
01:44:55 or 27 or whatever. Like, I really
01:44:57 think that our ideas really are going
01:44:59 to calcify in our brains.
01:45:01 And, like, things like, like,
01:45:03 all the crazy stuff going on with, like, gender
01:45:05 these days, and pushing, like, norms
01:45:07 from, from olden times and all that stuff.
01:45:09 Like, that all could be 100%
01:45:11 exactly, like, in 100 years, we'll
01:45:13 look back and be, like, this is exactly
01:45:15 what we needed. It was 100% moral. But, like,
01:45:17 everyone alive today, you know, most people,
01:45:19 the youngest generation is coming up,
01:45:21 they're just, like, those people are, like, yeah,
01:45:23 this is what we need to do. We're going to push towards this.
01:45:25 And the older people, through no fault of their own,
01:45:27 are just scared and confused.
01:45:29 And, like, really, I don't think
01:45:31 those people, many of them, will actually
01:45:33 change. So, if everyone became immortal,
01:45:35 these ideas just might calcify
01:45:37 and we'd stop here. I think that's why
01:45:39 death and the next generation is a
01:45:41 valuable cycle to keep, to keep happening.
01:45:43 I write about this towards the start
01:45:45 of my book that I was saying how, like,
01:45:47 I don't like it, but I agree.
01:45:49 I was saying, like, I know there's lots of people
01:45:51 who want to live alone and who might be pursuing
01:45:53 immortality so that they themselves
01:45:55 can have more impact. And I'm, like, you know,
01:45:57 I think that's fine if you really are
01:45:59 a brilliant mind, maybe we could use you
01:46:01 around for a little longer. But, like, as soon
01:46:03 as your ideas become dogmatized,
01:46:05 they need to go. Because, ultimately...
01:46:07 In 200 years. Like, ultimately,
01:46:09 until the moment that we can say
01:46:11 we escaped entropy,
01:46:13 there is no reason to stop
01:46:15 evolving. Like, there's no reason to ever
01:46:17 say we have all the answers, we know
01:46:19 what's going on, we know what to do.
01:46:21 Like, if we're still in the
01:46:23 universe, if we're still here not
01:46:25 escaping the inevitable heat
01:46:27 death of it, then, like, we will
01:46:29 die out unless we have found that way.
01:46:31 There's a final boss to be defeated, for sure, still.
01:46:33 And even if it might not even be the
01:46:35 final boss, like, it's the last one we know
01:46:37 about, you know, maybe when we get out.
01:46:39 Right. We don't know how it
01:46:41 could be turtles all the way down, but, like,
01:46:43 until we have escaped entropy,
01:46:45 we have no reason to stop
01:46:47 because otherwise, like, we will die.
01:46:49 Like, eventually.
01:46:51 Agreed. I love that expression
01:46:53 trilogy all the way down. It's like, I don't
01:46:55 remember who told me, like,
01:46:57 recently, I've been recently hearing that
01:46:59 there was a story written by
01:47:01 Terry Pratchett.
01:47:03 Yeah.
01:47:05 Terry Pratchett was who I was written by.
01:47:07 Gib says to Terry Pratchett
01:47:09 Discworld.
01:47:11 But the story was specifically that
01:47:13 he was doing a talk explaining the origin
01:47:15 of the world and how it functioned
01:47:17 stuff, and then afterward, a woman comes
01:47:19 up to him, at least, this is the story
01:47:21 of the story.
01:47:23 I don't remember if it was with you guys
01:47:25 or with Biter.
01:47:27 Or afterward, a woman comes up to him.
01:47:29 At least, this is the story that I've heard.
01:47:31 And says, like, excuse me, I appreciate the talk,
01:47:33 but I want to let you know you've been wrong
01:47:35 about everything. The entire world is, in fact,
01:47:37 on the back of a turtle.
01:47:39 No, no, but that doesn't make any sense.
01:47:41 Why would he be giving a talk about...
01:47:43 I'm reading it. I don't know.
01:47:45 No, I'm reading it right now on Wikipedia.
01:47:47 Turtles all the way down is an expression
01:47:49 of the problem of infinite regress.
01:47:51 The saying eludes the mythological idea of a world turtle
01:47:53 that supports the earth on its back.
01:47:55 It's an even larger turtle, which itself
01:47:57 is part of a column of increasingly large
01:47:59 turtles that continues indefinitely.
01:48:01 It's literally what I'm talking about.
01:48:03 It says the origin of the phrases on
01:48:05 Sir. The world turtle also referred to
01:48:07 as the cosmic turtle. The word bearing turtle
01:48:09 is a mythime, myth theme,
01:48:11 that seems to be the word myth and meme
01:48:13 combined, similar
01:48:15 to that of the world elephants,
01:48:17 encouraged in Hindu mythology,
01:48:19 Chinese mythology, and mythologies of indigenous
01:48:21 people of the Americas.
01:48:23 So I guess it's just come up
01:48:25 in a lot of different cultures.
01:48:27 Many 20th century
01:48:29 attribution claim William James is the source
01:48:31 of the phrase. James referred to the fable
01:48:33 of the elephant and tortoise several times,
01:48:35 but told the infinite regress story with rocks
01:48:37 all the way down in his 1882
01:48:39 essay, Rationality, Activity, and Faith.
01:48:41 I didn't even realize that this phrase
01:48:43 actually was about the thing I was
01:48:45 actually talking about.
01:48:47 I had no idea it was so specifically about it.
01:48:49 What did you think it meant?
01:48:51 I just thought... It sounds pretty abstract.
01:48:53 Yeah, I didn't realize
01:48:55 it was literally about the idea
01:48:57 that the world is resting on top
01:48:59 of a bigger world and all that.
01:49:01 Yes? Stephen Hawking
01:49:03 Stephen Hawking wrote
01:49:05 the story about the old woman
01:49:07 in his 1988 book, A Brief History of Time,
01:49:09 so that might
01:49:11 have popularized. That's probably the story I was trying to...
01:49:13 Okay, and this is weird.
01:49:15 In his telling of
01:49:17 the parable of the old woman
01:49:19 saying turtles all the way down,
01:49:21 he says that some say
01:49:23 that it was Bertrand Russell who the old
01:49:25 woman said it to, but that's
01:49:27 very wishy-washy.
01:49:29 Why would he say that?
01:49:31 Maybe he thought this was a real story,
01:49:33 and maybe it is a real story?
01:49:35 Okay, wait, we're splitting hairs.
01:49:37 It's all bullshit.
01:49:39 It's turtles all the way down, dude.
01:49:41 I really love that expression, though.
01:49:43 The mental image I get
01:49:45 is adorable, honestly.
01:49:47 It's a lot of turtles.
01:49:49 I've always just pictured the Ninja Turtles
01:49:51 on each other's backs.
01:49:53 What is scary
01:49:55 phrase all the way down?
01:49:57 But to where?
01:49:59 I just mentioned that.
01:50:01 I'll stack up like these adventure
01:50:03 time-esque-style turtles
01:50:05 with these really simple faces.
01:50:07 It's just adorable little turtles.
01:50:09 I've heard the phrase, I think
01:50:11 in philosophy class, there was the phrase
01:50:13 bugs all the way down, which is not
01:50:15 really about the
01:50:17 what the Earth is resting on.
01:50:19 It's about matter.
01:50:21 It's the idea that matter is infinitely
01:50:23 reducible, that you've got cells,
01:50:25 and then cells are made of molecules, and atoms.
01:50:27 And then it's like, oh, Adam's quarks,
01:50:29 quarks, gluons, and then
01:50:31 smaller and smaller things they're
01:50:33 divisible into.
01:50:35 Is it fair to think of the Procrastinators
01:50:37 as a science fiction podcast?
01:50:39 Sometimes, sure.
01:50:41 We get into futurism talk every episode,
01:50:43 like, that's science facts.
01:50:45 That's true.
01:50:47 Hey, Ben, I'm re-watching No Game, No Life,
01:50:49 and it's awesome.
01:50:51 Yeah, explain to me.
01:50:53 The part about the sun.
01:50:55 Yeah, tell me.
01:50:57 Or the part about the strong.
01:50:59 No, the electromagnetic force, the strong force.
01:51:01 Okay, so I've got the columns force
01:51:03 is what we're talking about.
01:51:05 In No Game, the color force.
01:51:07 Columns force, columns force.
01:51:09 Oh, Coulombs, the Coulombs force.
01:51:11 Yeah, Coulombs law, yeah.
01:51:13 Okay, what is this? Please explain.
01:51:15 So, okay, in No Game, No Life,
01:51:17 episode 6.
01:51:19 There's this part, or maybe 5.
01:51:21 No, it's episode 6. There's a part with the main character
01:51:23 and this...
01:51:25 I guess I'll describe her as like an angel.
01:51:27 She's like an all-over.
01:51:29 A very powerful being.
01:51:31 She creates this simulated world
01:51:33 where they're playing a game of sherry-tory
01:51:35 where every time
01:51:37 one person says a word,
01:51:39 that thing will come into existence
01:51:41 and then the next person says a word
01:51:43 and whatever they say disappears from existence.
01:51:45 And so they go back and forth
01:51:47 creating and destroying
01:51:49 either physical objects or concepts.
01:51:51 And the idea is that
01:51:53 the main character,
01:51:55 because he knows words from...
01:51:57 because it's an Isekai show and he knows
01:51:59 words from our world that the person
01:52:01 he's talking to doesn't know what they mean
01:52:03 and she just kind of ignores the words
01:52:05 that she doesn't know what they mean.
01:52:07 Like he summons an atom bomb.
01:52:09 The first thing he does is summon an atomic bomb
01:52:11 and that's what causes her to
01:52:13 put them inside of a force field kind of situation
01:52:15 where basically anything can happen.
01:52:17 They can die in this game
01:52:19 but it'll all be fine.
01:52:21 So what he does is
01:52:23 he removes the crust of the earth
01:52:25 and the mantle
01:52:27 and everything but the core
01:52:29 before eventually removing the lithosphere
01:52:31 and when he does that they start free-falling
01:52:33 towards the center of the earth.
01:52:35 But as they're falling it's like
01:52:37 who will fall faster
01:52:39 and die first and they keep removing concepts
01:52:41 and eventually he removes
01:52:43 Coulomb's force from the universe.
01:52:45 Coulomb's force.
01:52:47 It's the electromagnetic force.
01:52:49 And I guess essentially
01:52:51 what Coulomb's force is is that
01:52:53 well I mean if you look it up on Wikipedia
01:52:55 it's called Coulomb's force.
01:52:57 Or Coulomb's law.
01:52:59 Guys what the hell is this?
01:53:01 Explain it.
01:53:03 It's a force that is holding things
01:53:05 in place I guess
01:53:07 like without it
01:53:09 everything just collapses in on itself
01:53:11 and becomes a supernova I guess.
01:53:13 Yeah it's electromagnetic.
01:53:15 So does he immediately die when he does this?
01:53:17 That's what holds atoms together.
01:53:19 What happens is he does that and then everything
01:53:21 starts getting like more rapidly sucked
01:53:23 into the sun and because
01:53:25 the person he's fighting is falling
01:53:27 is closer to it than he is
01:53:29 she dies first.
01:53:31 What exactly happens when he removes Coulomb's law?
01:53:33 I forget.
01:53:35 It just all super collapses.
01:53:37 The whole universe folds in on itself basically.
01:53:39 Does the sun collapse into a black hole or something?
01:53:41 Yeah well okay and that's true
01:53:43 that's cool and that would happen.
01:53:45 The thing that bothers me though is that their bodies
01:53:47 would have just ceased to exist.
01:53:49 I thought when I was watching the scene
01:53:51 as soon as the Earth's lithosphere
01:53:53 disappeared I thought well
01:53:55 wouldn't they just die right here
01:53:57 instantly?
01:53:59 Yeah they'd be in the vacuum of space.
01:54:01 The way the scene progresses is awesome
01:54:03 but you have to make certain exceptions.
01:54:05 It is awesome but there's no
01:54:07 getting around the fact that if the
01:54:09 electromagnetic force were just gone
01:54:11 then all the atoms in your body would just fly
01:54:13 apart. Maybe they're protected because
01:54:15 they're in this force field? Maybe it didn't affect them?
01:54:17 I don't know.
01:54:19 I don't know.
01:54:21 That's the reason I brought it up because
01:54:23 I had heard Ben talk about how
01:54:25 simultaneously this scene is why
01:54:27 he loved the show but also that
01:54:29 he had a bunch of problems with it.
01:54:31 That's why I wanted to run it by him again.
01:54:33 I really like the show but I also hate the show.
01:54:35 What do you hate about it?
01:54:37 I love everything about the show.
01:54:39 I really like the idea behind the
01:54:41 concepts and the whole game shtick
01:54:43 but the thing is with the games
01:54:45 they sort of like
01:54:47 in a way I do like that they make up the rules
01:54:49 as they go but at the same time there's no
01:54:51 bases.
01:54:53 They just pull stuff out of their ass
01:54:55 that was the best game.
01:54:57 That was my favorite.
01:54:59 The thing about the games in the show
01:55:01 is that
01:55:03 all of them have
01:55:05 rules that can just be exploited
01:55:07 in ways that
01:55:09 make them more complicated than
01:55:11 a simple game would be.
01:55:13 For instance in the first arc they're playing a game of chess
01:55:15 but the idea is that
01:55:17 the pieces have a will of their own
01:55:19 so as long as you communicate with the pieces
01:55:21 and you can inspire them
01:55:23 they basically just do anything.
01:55:25 They don't have to move on the board
01:55:27 the way that you instruct them to.
01:55:29 I like the whole idea and the concepts
01:55:31 and stuff like that. It's been a while since I watched it
01:55:33 so this is just an impression that's lasting
01:55:35 so I could be wrong.
01:55:37 I like that.
01:55:39 I like those sort of things
01:55:41 but
01:55:43 it's kind of like
01:55:45 the you you heart of the card sort of
01:55:47 bullshit sometimes.
01:55:49 With the heart of the cards
01:55:51 it's like
01:55:53 he literally just gets the luck of the draw
01:55:55 he just believes in himself a lot
01:55:57 and gets the right card.
01:55:59 It's a little hard to put it into words
01:56:01 because I like the sort of
01:56:03 randomness at the same time
01:56:05 it could be
01:56:07 a bit smarter
01:56:09 and work within the rules it established.
01:56:11 I don't think it ever breaks its own rules.
01:56:13 I don't agree.
01:56:15 I don't think there is any
01:56:17 that the chess solution breaks any of the rules.
01:56:19 I'm not talking about the chess
01:56:21 specifically. It started well
01:56:23 and I think it just sort of
01:56:25 I don't remember. I think it escalated a bit.
01:56:27 I don't know.
01:56:29 Please make it your anime suck.
01:56:31 No game. I need to re-watch it.
01:56:33 It was a long time ago.
01:56:35 I'm in the process of watching it
01:56:37 so I know exactly
01:56:39 what happens and how I can defend it all
01:56:41 because a major
01:56:43 a big part of the theme of the show
01:56:45 how they win all their games
01:56:47 is just by understanding that
01:56:49 in a deterministic universe
01:56:51 everything has a logic behind it.
01:56:53 You can always analyze
01:56:55 there is no such thing as luck.
01:56:57 There's no such thing as pure chance
01:56:59 because there's always reasons
01:57:01 that things would happen the way they do.
01:57:03 Just like how you can count cards
01:57:05 to cheat the odds in Blackjack.
01:57:07 Used as an example
01:57:09 of a basic way that
01:57:11 as long as you can predict probabilities
01:57:13 the idea of
01:57:15 the metaphor of the
01:57:17 No Game No Life universe is that
01:57:19 it's just the exact same as real life
01:57:21 except that people are beholden to
01:57:23 these certain rules
01:57:25 that basically
01:57:27 the rules that already
01:57:29 apply in the real world
01:57:31 except that people have to follow them
01:57:33 there's just certain things
01:57:35 you cannot kill people in this world
01:57:37 because God himself has written a rule
01:57:39 that you can't kill people
01:57:41 forced to not do the thing
01:57:43 Right. So like whereas in the real world
01:57:45 people can act against their
01:57:47 best interest and even if
01:57:49 everyone plays the game correctly
01:57:51 someone can just kill you
01:57:53 in this world you can't
01:57:55 so like if you can play
01:57:57 the game the best you will win
01:57:59 like is the way the world works
01:58:01 and so that's why the main characters
01:58:03 are taken there because they are the best at games
01:58:05 and whereas in the real world
01:58:07 that does not help them because they are
01:58:09 just two relatively powerless
01:58:11 average Japanese teens
01:58:13 by going to a world where being the best
01:58:15 at games means you are God
01:58:17 they can be God
01:58:19 is essentially what the show is about
01:58:21 One more thing I have an issue with it
01:58:23 and this one I know
01:58:25 you won't be able to change my mind no matter what
01:58:27 but this is a matter
01:58:29 of taste so I'm
01:58:31 willing to accept it but I really dislike how
01:58:33 I don't mind
01:58:35 fan service a lot of the time
01:58:37 but in this show
01:58:39 I hate how they sort of
01:58:41 stop the flow
01:58:43 of the story just to have the scenes
01:58:45 with those fan services and it's very
01:58:47 very obnoxious
01:58:49 the fan services
01:58:51 is part of the message to me
01:58:53 I think it's a big... I'm writing a video
01:58:55 I'm writing a huge video about No Game No Life
01:58:57 so I'll talk about all of this
01:58:59 but I think
01:59:01 the fan service is important to
01:59:03 what the message of the show is
01:59:05 I won't get into it
01:59:07 I'll save it for my video
01:59:09 let's save all of this for another time when I'm not here
01:59:11 let's do all of that
01:59:13 that sounds great
01:59:15 let's go to questions for Christ's sake please
01:59:17 no
01:59:19 I want to talk about that I got really drunk last night
01:59:21 in my discord
01:59:23 in Ben St's Hellfire hand
01:59:25 I had a fucking bone to dig deep in
01:59:27 and we got really drunk
01:59:29 and I vommed
01:59:31 and I puked for the first time and forever
01:59:33 I don't remember going to bed
01:59:35 but I just remember being over my toilet
01:59:37 forcing myself to puke
01:59:39 which is something that I never ever do
01:59:41 and it was great
01:59:43 and I feel wonderful this morning
01:59:45 well that's good
01:59:47 and you know what the best part is
01:59:49 a little bird told me
01:59:51 wait no it's not
01:59:53 it is there's no carbs in it
01:59:55 that's horseshit there's like
01:59:57 because alcohol itself
01:59:59 the chemical alcohol
02:00:01 it has calories
02:00:03 but it doesn't have it's not carbs
02:00:05 oh really?
02:00:07 Ben
02:00:09 I understand that you have a
02:00:11 homestuck book club going on
02:00:13 in your server would you like to explain
02:00:15 to the class
02:00:17 oh yeah
02:00:19 I do not have a homestuck book club
02:00:21 but there is a homestuck book club
02:00:23 I'm just endorsing it
02:00:25 monetarily and spiritually
02:00:27 you'll be hearing from our lawyer Ben
02:00:29 you'll be hearing quite
02:00:31 an earful
02:00:33 look
02:00:35 I just think anything
02:00:37 my ownership of
02:00:39 reading homestuck will not be
02:00:41 besmirched
02:00:43 that ever was written or ever will be written
02:00:45 and that is homestuck and I think that that can only be
02:00:47 a good thing and I support it wholeheartedly
02:00:49 whenever you go to homestuck.com
02:00:51 there's a prompt to PayPal me
02:00:53 for the pleasure of reading homestuck
02:00:55 and you will
02:00:57 kowtow to my demands
02:00:59 immediately
02:01:01 yeah
02:01:03 what's much for you
02:01:05 yeah shout out to
02:01:07 shout out to the homestuck book club
02:01:09 shout out to my lawyer
02:01:11 god Mclaugh
02:01:13 hellfire boys
02:01:15 let's go to the questions
02:01:17 yeah I can't wait
02:01:19 before the questions
02:01:21 about the contest thing maybe mentioned to people
02:01:23 oh right thanks for reminding me
02:01:25 alright guys so you know
02:01:27 you'll be hearing this a week since the last episode
02:01:29 which was the final deadline closing
02:01:31 for the PCP theme contest
02:01:33 so just to review
02:01:35 it's closed, it's done, you're finished everyone
02:01:37 it's over for you
02:01:39 we are planning to have
02:01:41 the announcement as to the winner next episode
02:01:43 so one week from today
02:01:45 you should be hearing who the new
02:01:47 PCP theme will be
02:01:49 and it'll be glorious, it'll be grand
02:01:51 and we'll probably announce
02:01:53 I think we do like a top 3 announcement
02:01:55 and then we'll just be like
02:01:57 one is but a bang
02:01:59 and that'll be that, yeah it'll be fine
02:02:01 we'll make it fine, we'll make it real fine
02:02:03 don't worry guys it won't suck like everything else
02:02:05 right off the top I got a question I can just answer
02:02:07 real quick because this person
02:02:09 Vale asked with the formless format
02:02:11 seemingly being here to stay is there a PCP topic
02:02:13 that you would have wanted to do a PCP-centric episode on
02:02:15 guys the topics are not
02:02:17 gone
02:02:19 the goal conceit here is that
02:02:21 we were making up topics
02:02:23 just for the sake of having a topic
02:02:25 because we almost never have
02:02:27 a natural topic for the show
02:02:29 so if we ever had a topic
02:02:31 we had an idea for we would just do that
02:02:33 topic immediately
02:02:35 that's gonna be it
02:02:37 so no need to fear whenever there's something real important
02:02:39 we wanna talk about we will
02:02:41 I have a pity question here
02:02:43 it's from Alex Siebel
02:02:45 on Twitter who was one of the contest
02:02:47 one of the submitted us
02:02:49 one of our two songs I think for the contest
02:02:51 he asks
02:02:53 how was pokemon go community day for y'all
02:02:55 I personally was sad about playing alone
02:02:57 but got 15 shinies so that's cool
02:02:59 also to randoms going through the hashtag
02:03:01 for some reason my trainer code is
02:03:03 652622648067
02:03:09 I know you won't read it on the show
02:03:11 fuck you Alex
02:03:13 there you go
02:03:15 anyway I wanted to read it
02:03:17 and it was lame it was suck
02:03:19 it was suck
02:03:21 you got like 15 eebies didn't you
02:03:23 and then I just saw Eevee over and over again
02:03:25 there's no special move
02:03:27 for the eeveelutions
02:03:29 yeah there was
02:03:31 yeah there is last resort
02:03:33 well ok but Gib is reporting that he met real
02:03:35 locals families
02:03:37 it was sick he got a register
02:03:39 I got a register as well
02:03:41 just the word community
02:03:43 I don't have one
02:03:45 he would endorse that Nazi
02:03:47 I don't care about any of the shinies
02:03:49 I don't care about Eevee
02:03:51 I don't care about the shinies either
02:03:53 I still need an umbrella and an espion
02:03:55 I was glad to do it because when they release
02:03:57 gen 4 there's going to be two new eeveelutions
02:03:59 and it's going to be hard to get them
02:04:01 so now I've got enough candies that I can get that leafeon
02:04:03 and glaceon
02:04:05 I missed it because I don't understand how event days work
02:04:07 and how they're
02:04:09 I missed it because I understand everything
02:04:11 I didn't know it was like a 3 hour window
02:04:13 bullshit
02:04:15 it's going on right now
02:04:17 is it too late? can I go?
02:04:19 no it's going on to 5pm today
02:04:21 I'm probably going to do it right after
02:04:23 I must away
02:04:25 actually I had
02:04:27 so I was walking around
02:04:29 and it was like 5 minutes before the end
02:04:31 and I was catching
02:04:33 there was a cluster of eevees
02:04:35 oh I got a magmar and a ray
02:04:37 I got my first magmar
02:04:39 that's cool
02:04:41 I'm standing on the corner
02:04:43 I'm on the campus of Tufts University
02:04:45 and this guy
02:04:47 he sees me playing
02:04:49 and he's a very
02:04:51 autistic looking gentleman
02:04:53 and he sees me
02:04:55 and we just kind of nodded each other
02:04:57 and it's raining and he kind of comes over
02:04:59 and he's like can I borrow your umbrella
02:05:01 and so I was like yeah sure
02:05:03 so it was like alright here you go
02:05:05 so we stayed dry for a minute caught the last eevees
02:05:07 and we were just shooting the shit for a second
02:05:09 and he was like oh there's a machamp
02:05:11 there's a machamp raid over there
02:05:13 but it's only 4 minutes left
02:05:15 and I was like oh shit we can make it
02:05:17 so we ran over to this machamp
02:05:19 we fought this machamp raid, got him a champ
02:05:21 it had a terrible moveset, whatever
02:05:23 and then we just bummed around
02:05:25 and tried trading
02:05:27 we traded eridactyls with each other
02:05:29 we got lucky eridactyls
02:05:31 oh is that a thing?
02:05:33 yeah yeah
02:05:35 it's cheaper to boost
02:05:37 it's not a thing necessarily of higher eevees
02:05:39 because we did a bunch of couple
02:05:41 well maybe it does I don't know
02:05:43 okay fine
02:05:45 shut up
02:05:47 and then we
02:05:49 yep so I got a lucky eridactyl
02:05:51 and that was my community day
02:05:53 one fun thing that actually didn't happen
02:05:55 is I was walking down
02:05:57 down bubble
02:06:01 and then
02:06:03 being the cleanly man that I do
02:06:05 the saint of
02:06:07 prestige
02:06:09 there was a homeless woman
02:06:11 there was a frankly disgusting
02:06:13 dirty pig pin
02:06:15 garbage pail kid of a woman
02:06:19 with her husband
02:06:21 her groveling husband
02:06:23 and her pukestane children
02:06:25 and she came up to me
02:06:27 and she held on tightly to my shirt
02:06:29 and she begged me she got on all fours
02:06:31 she got on all eights
02:06:33 fine little legs
02:06:35 she's a succubus she's a spider
02:06:37 and she asked me she begged me
02:06:39 please please can we please trade
02:06:41 rare pokemon
02:06:43 she begged me for rare pokemon
02:06:45 and I had to capitulate
02:06:47 and so I gave this family
02:06:49 this wife I gave this wife
02:06:51 a Mr. Mime
02:06:53 named Mr. Meme
02:06:55 she gave me an unknown
02:06:57 and after that she was satiated
02:06:59 and she went off to pawn off
02:07:01 to steal another person's rare pokemon
02:07:05 I think you got the short end
02:07:07 of the stick in that trade
02:07:09 but I mean
02:07:11 also by the way in case you couldn't tell
02:07:13 a woman asking if she wanted to trade
02:07:15 the other day and that's what happened
02:07:19 so here's a light hearted
02:07:21 question that everyone is sure to have
02:07:23 straightforward opinion on
02:07:25 Pato today asked what do you think of abortion
02:07:27 good
02:07:29 oh it's great
02:07:31 pretty all four
02:07:33 in any context
02:07:35 it's acceptable
02:07:37 cool
02:07:39 prove to me that that baby's life matters
02:07:41 because I don't think it does
02:07:43 that's where I objectively truly stick
02:07:45 I mean I don't think that it's sentient
02:07:47 and is worthy of moral consideration
02:07:49 and so I'm fine with it being destroyed
02:07:51 that's how I feel
02:07:53 next question
02:07:55 if you died and had a charity foundation
02:07:57 created in your name
02:07:59 wait what did mage say? I'm curious about her opinion
02:08:01 I said I didn't even get the answer
02:08:03 but my opinion is
02:08:05 I guess yeah
02:08:07 with uncertain circumstances
02:08:09 that's fine
02:08:11 all circumstances
02:08:13 a certain point it becomes
02:08:15 more of a sentient being
02:08:17 and that's no
02:08:19 I've heard stories
02:08:21 horror stories of women getting pregnant
02:08:23 just so they can do abortions
02:08:25 what?
02:08:27 I think
02:08:29 there were like
02:08:31 some like
02:08:33 nutcase ratfemme sort of people
02:08:35 yeah
02:08:37 that's fucking
02:08:39 I'm surprised I had never conceived of that
02:08:41 but I'm not I guess I shouldn't be
02:08:43 surprised anyway
02:08:45 if you died and had a charity foundation
02:08:47 created in your name what would you have them do
02:08:49 terrorism
02:08:51 oh
02:08:53 plain and simple terrorism
02:08:55 a charity foundation
02:08:57 I would create
02:08:59 they would be a nonprofit
02:09:01 museum and they would only
02:09:03 show art made on the internet
02:09:05 from people ages like
02:09:07 8 to 17
02:09:11 okay listen that's fine
02:09:13 that's good but mine is the most important one
02:09:15 and it will save society
02:09:17 my charity foundation would be
02:09:19 help nerds get laid
02:09:21 and what it would be
02:09:23 and it would do everything in its power
02:09:25 to see that young men were quick
02:09:27 to seduce sexy young women
02:09:29 women are fine they don't have to worry about it
02:09:31 it's fine they can fuck anyone
02:09:33 don't worry about it
02:09:35 so they would be dating education
02:09:37 that's exactly what it would be
02:09:39 that's exactly what it would be
02:09:41 my charity would probably be for like
02:09:43 animal shelters
02:09:45 that's a good one
02:09:47 yeah because
02:09:49 I don't like that
02:09:51 all I gotta say about animals is
02:09:53 when we leave the universe
02:09:55 when we escape entropy
02:09:57 why are we not taking animals
02:09:59 they didn't earn it
02:10:01 because there aren't
02:10:03 they aren't a sin to you
02:10:05 do you think they would take us
02:10:07 I don't care about what they
02:10:09 would take us
02:10:11 I want to see elephants
02:10:13 I'm gonna take the elephants
02:10:15 we can fit them in
02:10:17 we can create new elements
02:10:19 we can just invent better
02:10:21 elephants later
02:10:23 we can just test to create
02:10:25 cooler elephants
02:10:27 I don't want to go there
02:10:29 let's move on
02:10:31 you're typing a lot of things
02:10:33 if you want to join in just start recording
02:10:35 that's fine dude you ain't getting paid
02:10:37 but you can contribute
02:10:39 alright
02:10:41 I had a question I liked this one a lot
02:10:43 it was just at Gergerad
02:10:45 what was your first experience
02:10:47 with being a depraved individual
02:10:49 um
02:10:51 I love that I like that one a lot
02:10:53 define depraved individual
02:10:55 I think it's kind of a personal question
02:10:57 yeah when I turned on that fabled game
02:10:59 Undertale I knew
02:11:01 does he mean like when did you realize
02:11:03 you were a depraved person
02:11:05 I mean he said what was your experience
02:11:07 with being a depraved
02:11:09 the first like the start
02:11:11 of your slide into depravity
02:11:13 was the first time I ever fucked an inanimate object
02:11:15 I knew
02:11:17 I mean honestly that's also my example
02:11:19 that's also my example
02:11:21 it's that weird time that I weirdly figured out
02:11:23 how to masturbate in the back of
02:11:25 the minivan
02:11:27 at the end of a soccer game
02:11:29 it was extremely freakish
02:11:31 it was just when I learned what masturbating was
02:11:33 that's what it was
02:11:35 yeah it was really gross
02:11:37 what's weird about that
02:11:39 I don't fuck my club
02:11:41 I mean like we're
02:11:43 I was in public technically
02:11:45 if that is not depraved
02:11:47 like do any of us actually do anything
02:11:49 that is depraved
02:11:51 like obviously none of us are depraved by our own standards
02:11:53 like if we're all like
02:11:55 comfortable with ourselves and what we do
02:11:57 like I stole like a candy bar
02:11:59 probably at one point in my life from somewhere
02:12:01 like I probably did that I stole a donut from
02:12:03 stop and shop once years ago
02:12:05 I guess that's depraved
02:12:07 I got pregnant just to have an abortion
02:12:09 okay that's depraved
02:12:11 that's what I would think of as depraved
02:12:13 and I haven't done anything like that
02:12:15 so yeah I don't think I have either
02:12:17 sorry sorry
02:12:19 oh you know what no
02:12:21 I have a much better example
02:12:23 it's the time that I made Victor put his face in the toilet
02:12:25 oh no
02:12:27 what the fuck
02:12:29 that is depraved
02:12:31 because growing up I just tortured Victor
02:12:33 by making him do things
02:12:35 because he's very easy to emotionally
02:12:37 and so like
02:12:39 I probably just like
02:12:41 I probably told him something
02:12:43 we used to fight all the time about who would do the dishes
02:12:45 because like my dad would always get mad
02:12:47 that the dishes weren't done when he got home
02:12:49 and but neither of us ever wanted to do it
02:12:51 and we would try to like cycle between us
02:12:53 and like have a chore chart and everything
02:12:55 but neither of us would do it so we would just fight
02:12:57 for like an entire hour and not end up doing it
02:12:59 before he got home usually what would happen
02:13:01 is he would get home and one of us would feel guilty
02:13:03 and start doing it right then
02:13:05 and usually it was him because he was more guilty than me
02:13:07 so what I would do is I would just manipulate him
02:13:09 by constantly being like oh you're gonna let dad down
02:13:11 like oh dad's gonna be so upset
02:13:13 he'd be like well why don't you care
02:13:15 I'm like I don't care you care
02:13:17 so you do it
02:13:19 and then I think at one time we struck some kind of deal
02:13:21 where I was just like yeah I'll do the dishes
02:13:23 if you fucking put your face in the toilet
02:13:25 and like you know gotta do that
02:13:27 yeah probably not
02:13:29 oh
02:13:31 we had these fights like every night for years
02:13:33 like over who would do
02:13:35 like ex chore
02:13:37 because we were just both
02:13:39 so lazy and like
02:13:41 we would get into physical altercations
02:13:43 over it you know
02:13:45 yeah this is not a hard thing but I understand the sentiment well
02:13:47 I felt it as well
02:13:49 the very very
02:13:51 sorry go ahead
02:13:53 the most depraved thing that I can think of
02:13:55 is a spotty memory I have
02:13:57 when I was like 12 I think
02:13:59 where I
02:14:01 was in my airplane I was flying towards the
02:14:03 world trade centers to blow them up
02:14:05 are you in an airplane right now
02:14:07 someone made you talk
02:14:09 so my auto can be deleted
02:14:11 and then I'll go after you
02:14:13 you sound like an airplane
02:14:15 okay okay yeah okay so like
02:14:17 I think the question was like what's the first
02:14:19 or something like that depravity
02:14:21 first experience with being a depraved
02:14:23 the first thing I remember
02:14:25 that I would like
02:14:27 considered being wrong but I just didn't give a damn
02:14:29 was like I was like 7
02:14:31 or maybe 6 or something
02:14:33 like that in that ballpark so like
02:14:35 me and this girl
02:14:37 we were like playing
02:14:39 and she had like a lot of cool toys and one
02:14:41 of the cool toys was like a miniature little
02:14:43 zebra toy and it was like
02:14:45 sort of accurate realistic it wasn't like you know
02:14:47 cutesy stylish or whatever it was
02:14:49 realistic and I was all about I'm still
02:14:51 all about those miniature little animal
02:14:53 toys that are look realistic
02:14:55 it's just I was my thing
02:14:57 and I loved it so much and
02:14:59 okay and
02:15:01 then like few days later
02:15:03 I was walking back
02:15:05 home and I saw on the ground
02:15:07 that little zebra toy
02:15:09 and it was just laying on the ground I picked it up
02:15:11 I was like oh it belongs to her I should return
02:15:13 it and then I sort of like
02:15:15 paused and I thought
02:15:17 you know if she didn't care enough to take care
02:15:19 of you she doesn't deserve you
02:15:21 so I kept it
02:15:23 good logic I would have done the same thing
02:15:25 I might actually
02:15:27 still have it though probably not
02:15:29 actually you know what
02:15:31 I would have done the same thing for the same reason
02:15:33 there was that time that I
02:15:35 kicked Ben in the stomach for literally no reason
02:15:37 because I wanted to see him suffer that's what I wanted
02:15:39 you like drop kicked me
02:15:41 we were lying weirdly I know I've told this before
02:15:43 we're like we're just lying like
02:15:45 heads on opposite sides of the couch
02:15:47 and I just lifted my foot and just dropped it
02:15:49 directly into Ben's stomach for no
02:15:51 reason because I felt
02:15:53 like watching a man ride in agony
02:15:55 that's what I felt like doing in that moment
02:15:57 I felt the moment
02:15:59 I regret it intensely
02:16:01 the time I felt the most depraved
02:16:03 is Ben you witnessed this
02:16:05 I was thinking of this on the show before
02:16:07 when I abstained
02:16:09 from drinking soda for like several months
02:16:11 and then when I was in Georgia
02:16:13 at a wing stop
02:16:15 this was like the most
02:16:17 impulse thing I didn't have no control
02:16:19 over my body in this scenario
02:16:21 I was just putting like I was putting my cup
02:16:23 in the trash and like within
02:16:25 the span of like two seconds I had
02:16:27 like jerked my hand from
02:16:29 the trash can I had stuffed my
02:16:31 because the trash can was right next to like the soft
02:16:33 you know soft drink like pour your thing
02:16:35 I had stuffed it in like a Fanta
02:16:37 orange soda I had
02:16:39 poured one sip I had swigged that one sip
02:16:41 and then I had slammed the cup into the trash
02:16:43 as hard as I possibly could
02:16:45 and then I walked out thinking like what did I just do
02:16:47 was that a dream and like am I awake right now
02:16:49 like was I in control like did I actually just do that
02:16:51 it was like
02:16:53 it was like my burger dream
02:16:55 and I walked out
02:16:57 and you were like hey what were you doing
02:16:59 I was just like I've done something terrible
02:17:03 I've sinned
02:17:05 I remember you broke your ass
02:17:07 I'm back on that by the way right now
02:17:09 I've been going for like a month
02:17:11 you threw it all away
02:17:13 Kaze told us that you guys were trying to like
02:17:15 be health boys
02:17:17 that's a way to do it man
02:17:19 no I'll never do that
02:17:21 hey by the way post foods going strong
02:17:23 it's going well
02:17:25 I'm drinking it right now
02:17:27 what is post food again
02:17:29 well I'm drinking this this lovely concoction
02:17:31 called huel
02:17:33 it's like uh it's like uh soylent
02:17:35 the show is turning into a fucking huel ad
02:17:37 week by week I just love huel
02:17:39 what does it taste like
02:17:41 tell me because it mostly just tastes like oats
02:17:43 it tastes like like an oats puree
02:17:45 it's not it's not bad
02:17:47 strawberry oats
02:17:49 paradox crocs asks
02:17:51 what is the thing that's changed about you most
02:17:53 in the last two or three years
02:17:55 post food baby
02:17:57 I'm on that huel train everyday
02:17:59 I would say
02:18:01 my answer is uh
02:18:03 caring less and less about myself
02:18:05 and more about other people
02:18:07 like just just gradually losing
02:18:09 interest in myself and in like
02:18:11 and like
02:18:13 I feel like I spent I had so much focus
02:18:15 on the idea that like no one had understood
02:18:17 the true me and like
02:18:19 now not only do I feel like
02:18:21 people are close enough that I don't that it's
02:18:23 fine but also just that like the true
02:18:25 me is not that interesting and that
02:18:27 like you know it's like
02:18:29 it's like it only needed to be like it needed to be
02:18:31 glimpsed as long as
02:18:33 somebody saw it and understood it that was all that
02:18:35 mattered it wasn't like I had to perform it all the
02:18:37 time it's not like the things I was doing
02:18:39 were so genius that like I had to
02:18:41 like my unique art had
02:18:43 to be out there in the world it's just like as long as
02:18:45 someone got it that it was all
02:18:47 down that Asian obliteration
02:18:49 the self for like the past year
02:18:51 I know it's been
02:18:53 great it's kind of my whole identity
02:18:55 now it's the east
02:18:57 I mean I've been I've
02:18:59 considered myself like a Taoist ever since
02:19:01 I was like 14 so like
02:19:03 I've been on this path
02:19:05 you know I've been on the Alan Watts
02:19:07 mind train for like
02:19:09 the last decade but
02:19:11 basically I am
02:19:13 lo-fi hip-hop is what I'm trying to say
02:19:15 I'd say for me
02:19:17 the biggest change
02:19:19 started with my resolution
02:19:21 to like do me a math of a stuff
02:19:23 it's a redoubling of
02:19:25 my efforts to actually succeed
02:19:27 in a business and like
02:19:29 economic and like actual life sustaining way
02:19:31 at like
02:19:33 YouTube stuff that's been that was a pretty
02:19:35 big change like decided to me a math
02:19:37 which was inspired by a lot of people
02:19:39 but yeah I mean like that and the whole
02:19:41 we Agua stuff and the way I'm
02:19:43 constantly I'm really focusing on trying
02:19:45 to recajigger my life so I can actually
02:19:47 make it
02:19:49 I don't know if you can accurately
02:19:51 tell what has changed about
02:19:53 you or maybe I'm just not self aware
02:19:55 to do so but
02:19:57 yeah it's hard
02:19:59 to say what what what have I
02:20:01 much I'll tell you what I think has changed
02:20:03 about you because like I mean
02:20:05 when when I at
02:20:07 the second or third brony con we were at
02:20:09 like you were so out
02:20:11 of control that I
02:20:13 felt the need to keep more distance
02:20:15 from you because of the
02:20:17 fact that I thought like if I have him around
02:20:19 all the time it will be very exhausting
02:20:21 and about a year later you had changed
02:20:23 enough and like matured enough
02:20:25 that I no longer felt that way and that's why
02:20:27 I wanted you in the PCP
02:20:29 so I would say that you've just become somebody
02:20:31 who's figured out that
02:20:33 if you scare people away
02:20:35 then they will
02:20:37 you know like if you try to just be
02:20:39 constantly freak flag flying
02:20:41 like oppressing people with your presence
02:20:43 then they will not want you around
02:20:45 and you have decided to care about that
02:20:47 the way I would feel like this is
02:20:49 you can scare someone in an instant
02:20:51 you can scare someone in about
02:20:53 like 0.8 seconds
02:20:55 it takes no effort at all to scare people
02:20:57 but to terrify someone you have to sink
02:20:59 your claws then that's the long
02:21:01 game if I want to terrify you guys
02:21:03 it's going to be a two or three years
02:21:05 at least
02:21:07 I was glad
02:21:09 I'm glad that's the
02:21:11 and I'm Keto now
02:21:13 that's all that's changed
02:21:15 for me it's like
02:21:17 if I want to shine in a positive light
02:21:19 I guess I could say like
02:21:21 I'm more about defining
02:21:23 the boundaries between me and people
02:21:25 but if I wanted to be either honest
02:21:27 or in a more negative light I think I've become
02:21:29 paranoid not too much
02:21:31 but like a few years ago
02:21:33 back in the pony days I would be like
02:21:35 oh everyone's my friend hello everyone
02:21:37 I shall call you friend but then
02:21:39 I realized the sort of
02:21:41 like the amount of
02:21:43 sort of pressure and weight the word
02:21:45 friend really has
02:21:47 and I sort of stopped
02:21:49 calling every single person I've talked
02:21:51 to once or twice a friend
02:21:53 because like
02:21:55 when you call someone a friend so
02:21:57 easily
02:21:59 I still have a bad habit of sort of like
02:22:01 people like really clicked
02:22:03 and I talk to them like once or twice
02:22:05 but we really click I sort of end up calling
02:22:07 them a friend that's
02:22:09 you gotta get into the word buddy
02:22:11 I do a lot of like
02:22:13 if you listen to my videos you hear a lot of me like dodging
02:22:15 like I'll say things like friend of the show
02:22:17 or my buddy or our pal
02:22:19 or things like that like I really want
02:22:21 to be protective of like the word friend
02:22:23 because people do put a lot of power on it
02:22:25 and when you start calling someone your friend publicly
02:22:27 then they are going to like latch on to that
02:22:29 and be like oh I am this person's friend
02:22:31 and like I suppose
02:22:33 pragmatically other people may then
02:22:35 hitch your wagon to theirs if let's say
02:22:37 this person does some things that you don't
02:22:39 approve of I mean yeah I usually
02:22:41 call people acquaintances or
02:22:43 friendos like friendos is
02:22:45 my catch all for like everyone
02:22:47 sort of like interact with
02:22:49 friendlet they're all friendlets to me
02:22:51 you're all
02:22:53 you're all mere friendlets before me
02:22:55 I don't know if this is the biggest change in my life
02:22:57 per se but this is definitely a change that I've noticed
02:22:59 where I've shifted away
02:23:01 I don't know if like I don't think these are like
02:23:03 mutually exclusive but I've definitely
02:23:05 moved away from
02:23:07 wanting to be friends with funny people
02:23:09 to be friends with smart people
02:23:11 I definitely value being
02:23:13 you know smart more than I value being funny
02:23:15 at this point I think
02:23:19 it reminds me of that highly intellectual
02:23:21 comedy thing that Bobby
02:23:23 Hill was learning in that one episode
02:23:25 of King of the Hill
02:23:29 Tartuffe
02:23:31 the spry wonder dog
02:23:35 I think I want to be friends
02:23:37 with funny people and smart people
02:23:39 but I would be friends with someone who was smart
02:23:41 but not funny but if someone was
02:23:43 funny but fucking stupid
02:23:45 I don't think I'd want to be their friend
02:23:47 I think wit takes a certain kind of
02:23:49 funny if they like to like
02:23:51 give people wedgies for example
02:23:53 and laugh at that
02:23:55 if they open fire
02:23:57 in public places
02:23:59 then I think that would be pretty funny
02:24:01 it would take a certain amount of emotional intelligence
02:24:03 I think that humor is
02:24:05 subjective and I think like
02:24:07 I value
02:24:09 a sense of humor
02:24:11 what's the word
02:24:15 a sense of humor that we share
02:24:17 I don't remember the proper word for it
02:24:19 but like if we can share a similar
02:24:21 something like that
02:24:25 if we share the sense of humor
02:24:27 I really value that because if you can have
02:24:29 a good time and a good laugh with a person
02:24:31 it's a lot easier to get along with them
02:24:33 and understand them and that's very
02:24:35 important in any sort of relationship
02:24:37 to be able to share the sense of humor
02:24:39 because when you talk to someone
02:24:41 someone cracks a joke and you don't understand it
02:24:43 it's very easy to take offense
02:24:45 and start seeing the person in a very
02:24:47 different sort of negative light
02:24:49 you might find them obnoxious, annoying
02:24:51 and that can build up to negative emotions
02:24:53 that's fair
02:24:55 this reminds me of a classic line
02:24:57 from one Sam Hyde
02:24:59 it's from some very popular
02:25:01 YouTube video called like
02:25:03 Sam Hyde gives great life advice
02:25:05 and Sam Hyde says
02:25:07 I'm friends with stupid people
02:25:09 with smart people, with assholes
02:25:11 with really nice people
02:25:13 because you can be friends with all of them
02:25:15 in different ways but it's when those people
02:25:17 become vacuums in your life
02:25:19 in whatever way
02:25:21 when they start to like drain life from you
02:25:23 in whatever way they happen to do so
02:25:25 that's when you know it's like
02:25:27 this person is not going to work out long
02:25:29 and you don't make a big stink about it
02:25:31 you don't write them a big letter
02:25:33 like dude, I think we're really fucked up
02:25:35 what you did, I'm not going to hang out with you anymore
02:25:37 you simply slowly let these relationships
02:25:39 fade in time
02:25:41 especially younger people think of a friend
02:25:43 as like someone who you want to spend all of your time with
02:25:45 and like for me
02:25:47 I think that you can have categories of friends
02:25:49 who are like this is my friend
02:25:51 for when I'm doing this
02:25:53 that's what, when you look at like
02:25:55 for instance, you might have
02:25:57 someone like a hiking buddy
02:25:59 this is a guy who I don't really have anything in common with
02:26:01 other than we both like hiking
02:26:03 but when I want to go hiking
02:26:05 with someone, this is my guy
02:26:07 because like the two of us
02:26:09 it's not simply a matter of you both like it
02:26:11 but that you engage with it the same way
02:26:13 like maybe you have other friends
02:26:15 who would love to go hiking with you
02:26:17 but they're not going to take it seriously
02:26:19 or they're not going to have the
02:26:21 they're not going to try to reach the top
02:26:23 or they're not going to be as efficient
02:26:25 and so you want to go hiking with this guy who hikes
02:26:27 like you hike
02:26:29 and so even if you have nothing else in common
02:26:31 it's like you can still think of him as
02:26:33 your hiking buddy
02:26:35 it's funny, I'm watching May play Persona 3
02:26:37 is about
02:26:39 the different categories of relationships
02:26:41 that you have and how they, you know
02:26:43 because you have different personas
02:26:45 no person is just one identity
02:26:47 you have different things you care about
02:26:49 that you can have people
02:26:51 different folks for different strokes
02:26:53 exactly, that's a perfect phrase
02:26:55 there you go
02:26:57 well, it's a little reversed but fair enough
02:26:59 what she said made sense
02:27:01 in this context
02:27:03 different, yeah
02:27:05 whatever, it doesn't matter
02:27:07 are we done? I think we're done guys
02:27:09 May, did you want to comment?
02:27:11 no, no, no, this is fine
02:27:13 I'm good, I'm fucking great
02:27:15 I got nothing else to say to any of you freaks
02:27:17 yeah, that's right, I gotta go hang out with my
02:27:19 good friends
02:27:21 the procrastinators
02:27:23 that's us people, five dollars bonus episodes
