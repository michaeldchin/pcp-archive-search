00:00:00 I'm not generally satisfied by the pace at which the world dispenses engagement, so on a conceptual level, I've always been obsessed with theme parks.
00:00:08 The idea is to create a controlled environment, allowing you to wander through and effortlessly create an experience of streamlined, instant gratification fun.
00:00:21 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, a podcast on the internet what a novelty.
00:00:29 I am the best guy ever and we're joined today by Munchy Where's Tiny Hats?
00:00:33 It's me, Legoland. Here I am before you today, the most decadent king of all. I'm here to spread my wealth and tell you about the most wondrous plans.
00:00:44 Famous Sonic YouTuber Hippocrit?
00:00:47 I was gonna say Legoland, you bitch.
00:00:49 What?
00:00:50 I love Legoland.
00:00:52 Oh, not as much as me.
00:00:54 We've also got The Davoo.
00:00:56 Hip bone, skelly, crits, wild ride was a really good value.
00:01:01 And Monkey Jones.
00:01:03 We're not even a minute in and I already have to pee.
00:01:06 Oh no.
00:01:07 Let's do what I do, dude.
00:01:09 Just do what I do and just go on air.
00:01:11 Just pee into your own mouth.
00:01:12 That's true.
00:01:13 I'm gonna pee into the bottle that I'm drinking out of and then just keep drinking out of it.
00:01:16 Yeah.
00:01:17 Hey, that's called second harvest. That's a water, a barter, barter, second harvest.
00:01:22 Wow, that's good.
00:01:24 Is that to Paul Newman's iced tea brand second harvest?
00:01:28 You know, I'm drinking Rolling Rocks, so it probably wouldn't change the taste at all.
00:01:32 Yeah, for Rolling Cock.
00:01:34 Nate, what is the PCP?
00:01:36 The PCP is the most knuckle-
00:01:40 Advanced.
00:01:41 Whitening, earth-shattering,
00:01:43 Red Pill exploding Red Pill podcast in the world about a bunch of internet creators
00:01:49 who all came together because they had the perfect opinion when combined.
00:01:53 Perfect.
00:01:54 Wait, do we introduce the show every episode now?
00:01:56 Yeah.
00:01:57 We're working on it.
00:01:58 We're working on it.
00:01:59 Okay, that's nice.
00:02:00 That's cool.
00:02:01 Keep forgetting what the show is and we have to remind them.
00:02:04 It's true.
00:02:05 It's true.
00:02:06 So hopefully they'll bake it into their brains this time.
00:02:08 Yeah.
00:02:09 So today, everybody, we're talking about amusement parks.
00:02:13 amusement parks, water parks, bumper cars, roller coasters.
00:02:17 Yeah.
00:02:18 Oh, the teacups.
00:02:19 The teacups.
00:02:20 Getting belated by Armenian men who run the rides.
00:02:24 Yeah.
00:02:25 Now we're talking.
00:02:27 Circus tent.
00:02:28 Dude, lots grinding into your fucking feet until they bleed.
00:02:32 That's true.
00:02:33 Exactly.
00:02:34 That's my favorite part.
00:02:36 Okay, the great thing about amusement parks, I just want to say off the bat, is that you
00:02:39 forget how painful just existing as a three-dimensional being is until the end of the day after you
00:02:44 just, you know, like you walk around, you experience life, and then at the end of the day you walk
00:02:48 home and you're dead.
00:02:49 It's great.
00:02:50 We should mention that we decided to do this after me becoming infatuated with a certain
00:02:55 water park vlogger by the name of Cy.
00:02:59 What is this?
00:03:00 I am not privy to this meme.
00:03:02 Dude.
00:03:03 There's no meme here.
00:03:04 Cy raised a water park vlog, and I was so enthralled by it, and specifically its thumbnail, and
00:03:10 how literally ingenious it is, and how much I legitimately enjoyed it.
00:03:13 I just want to see water park vlogs constantly.
00:03:17 We know Cy has a kind of a weird predicament where his like subscribers don't all watch
00:03:21 his videos.
00:03:22 Let me tell you, Cy, if you want 100% retention, the world needs water park vlogs.
00:03:26 Water park vlogs.
00:03:27 Guys, let me make a deal with you.
00:03:28 That's the best water park in the world!
00:03:30 And seriously, Cy, that was great.
00:03:32 Guys, I guarantee you I can get Cy to give me that thumbnail without text on it if we
00:03:36 want to use that as a thumbnail for this episode.
00:03:38 We should!
00:03:39 Okay, yeah, you're already going to see the thumbnail, because if it's going to be the
00:03:43 thumbnail you just click on.
00:03:45 Okay, fantastic.
00:03:46 Cy is in the thumbnail.
00:03:47 This episode is getting probably, what, 1500 views max?
00:03:50 I think that's how it works.
00:03:52 Yeah, probably.
00:03:53 Hey, before we get too deep into the thing, let me read, okay, so there's no amusement
00:03:57 park entry, an urban dictionary, but what I did find was a disease called amusement park
00:04:04 hangover.
00:04:05 All right, so let me just read this to you.
00:04:07 That feeling, and this is just like I was talking about before, the feeling you get the day
00:04:10 after going to an amusement park, particularly when you spend all day on intense rides,
00:04:15 symptoms include horse voice, headache, fatigue, and general pains, and then the description
00:04:20 is not funny, so I'm not going to read it.
00:04:22 So there you go.
00:04:23 There you go.
00:04:24 Okay, so that's where we're coming from.
00:04:25 What is our favorite amusement park?
00:04:27 I got to say Disney World in fucking Orlando, California.
00:04:31 Disney World, no question.
00:04:33 Nate, do you remember, do you remember this one time on Twitter where, I forget the exact
00:04:38 context of it.
00:04:39 Disney World, Disneyland, we were arguing whether Disneyland or Disney World was the
00:04:43 amusement park that one of our fans was attending, and I defeated you in hand-to-hand combat.
00:04:47 You did.
00:04:48 And I humiliated you, and you officially on that day handed me, quote, all of your
00:04:52 internets with a Z.
00:04:54 So I am not, in PCP Canada, in PCP lore, I'm objectively more powerful than Nate because
00:05:00 I have all of his internets.
00:05:02 So what that manifests is if you look at my download speeds, they're struggling to crank
00:05:07 out 0.01 kilobytes per second, whereas Munchy is just living in the lap of luxury, downloading
00:05:12 all the terror flops you could possibly want in his fucking life.
00:05:16 One day I'll get him back.
00:05:17 Whenever I click on a download link, I just hear a punch sound effect because it's
00:05:21 downloading so fast.
00:05:24 Download 55 new mouse clickers?
00:05:27 That instant.
00:05:28 Alright, Nate, why is Disney World the best theme park other than all the propaganda?
00:05:32 Yeah, that sounds like a shitty answer everybody knows there.
00:05:34 Let me see, I think I've been to, I don't know, maybe like six or so amusement parks
00:05:40 probably in my whole life, but Disney World was definitely the most fun.
00:05:43 Okay, but I'm sure a lot of it has to do, as I'm sure many of our stories will involve
00:05:47 the specific things that happened there and the situation that brought you there and the
00:05:51 people that were there, et cetera, et cetera.
00:05:53 So when I was in high school, me and my older brother Ben, who you might know, we both were
00:05:59 in marching band, and our marching band was pretty darn good.
00:06:03 And yeah, I know it's taken a weird start, but we were in marching band, I played the
00:06:08 clarinet, Ben played the saxophone, and we were well loved amongst our people in Massachusetts
00:06:15 where the school was.
00:06:18 Well basically, our marching band was good enough where we were invited to Disney World
00:06:23 to participate in March down the main avenue, and we all just, this would happen every single
00:06:29 year, we would all get together, we'd pack up our shit, and we'd all go down to Disney
00:06:33 World, and we'd just have a great time.
00:06:35 So go there to March during one of Disney World's gay days, did you and Ben have an
00:06:39 experience every year?
00:06:41 Do they allow gay people in Disney World?
00:06:43 No.
00:06:44 That place is really gone to shit.
00:06:46 This isn't a meme.
00:06:47 They specifically have gay days.
00:06:50 Does that mean no straight people are allowed?
00:06:52 I mean, I'm sure you can go if you're straight, as long as you, you know, hike your pants up.
00:06:56 You just have to suck a dick on your way.
00:06:58 Yeah, but specifically so that same-sex couples can come over and hang out and make out without
00:07:04 all the Christian kitties getting corrupted.
00:07:06 Okay, you know, I think that's a real fucking thing.
00:07:08 It's an exclusion by exclusion.
00:07:10 It's very popular.
00:07:11 Yeah, separate but equal.
00:07:13 That's kind of cool, you know, it should decide.
00:07:16 But my favorite thing about that is how Mad Walt Disney would have been if he knew this
00:07:19 video.
00:07:20 He'd be mistaking all these orgies and be like, God damn it, why didn't he freeze my head
00:07:24 like they said?
00:07:25 I want in.
00:07:26 I didn't give the Nazis enough money.
00:07:28 So we'll see, that's the great thing.
00:07:30 That's what I was going to say.
00:07:31 The best thing about Disney World is that canonically is the place where the frozen
00:07:35 Messiah Walt Disney's corpse lives right now.
00:07:38 And one day he will rise from the dead to save us all from the cuckoldry of modern life.
00:07:42 So that's, you know, that's why I go down there once a year to pray to him.
00:07:46 That's my Mecca.
00:07:47 And it's got the rock and roll roller coaster with Aerosmith, baby.
00:07:51 So that's where I do most of my work on that roller coaster.
00:07:55 Like, cool it would be if Walt Disney actually did get cured of death and he just came back.
00:08:02 Like and that actually paid off.
00:08:03 And then he had like the, the, all of his, what do you call them?
00:08:08 When you, yeah, copyrights.
00:08:09 All of his copyrights would be extended for another billion years because now he's alive.
00:08:13 Oh yeah.
00:08:14 The law will be fucked.
00:08:16 That's what's going to happen.
00:08:18 Disney is just going to like, the company's just going to hire someone to act like Walt
00:08:21 Disney.
00:08:22 Now copyright, this is copyright now because since we, since we asked them to extend it
00:08:26 too many times, we're just going to like reset the entire counter again.
00:08:29 That's going to be the new strat.
00:08:31 Silly old religious people who believe in souls and whatnot.
00:08:34 Not even, you know, you don't have to be religious, but whatever.
00:08:36 People who believe in souls think that like death is magical.
00:08:38 But death really is like an engineering problem that we could one day solve.
00:08:42 If Walt Disney came back from the dead, I think Disney would have a, the company would have
00:08:45 a really hard time readjusting to being like artistically motivated in like a personal way.
00:08:50 Maybe like, that's what it feels like to like have an idea.
00:08:55 I just, just the other day I was watching some documentary about a guy who like, used to
00:08:59 work at Walt Disney.
00:09:00 He called Walt Disney.
00:09:02 I fucked up.
00:09:03 I fucked up bad.
00:09:04 But he, like he said this quote that is totally famous, but I just forgot and he reminded me.
00:09:09 It's that Walt Disney is the guy who said that like, we don't make art to make money.
00:09:13 We make money to make art.
00:09:15 So for him, it was all about just, you know, like having the resources available to continue
00:09:19 to make his craft.
00:09:20 And you know, who knows?
00:09:21 Yeah.
00:09:22 You know, Jew hating aside, you know, you got to respect that.
00:09:24 You got to respect that.
00:09:25 Well, I respect you.
00:09:26 That's my personal goal.
00:09:27 That's my personal goal.
00:09:28 I don't know why I have to excuse that.
00:09:29 Of course.
00:09:30 Walt Disney famous for his Viagra with series.
00:09:32 Yeah.
00:09:33 Yeah.
00:09:34 Much beloved.
00:09:35 Much beloved.
00:09:36 Big Princess Tutu fan.
00:09:37 Now I, I too love all things Disney.
00:09:42 I'm a big Disney movie kind of guy and I love Disney theme parks.
00:09:45 However, I do not live on the disgusting, uh, rancid, fucking like, like yellow colored
00:09:51 dick that is the East Coast of the United States.
00:09:54 I live on the West Coast.
00:09:55 We're old money.
00:09:56 We're old money.
00:09:57 Yeah.
00:09:58 You're new money.
00:09:59 You'll never be one of us.
00:10:00 You'll never be one of us.
00:10:01 Disney specifically made the other parks because this is what I saw from their, from their
00:10:05 Disney world propaganda movies on the travel channel.
00:10:07 It was like, you know, back in the 60s, the ride over to get to Disneyland was filled with
00:10:12 all these cheap, cheesy hotels and diners and dives and shitty places and cheap smoke
00:10:17 shops.
00:10:18 And Disney was like, well, that's just a shitty way to get to my park.
00:10:20 So he built other ones.
00:10:21 Oh, by the way, guys, the ride into Disneyland is no longer like that.
00:10:25 Law.
00:10:26 Is that, okay.
00:10:27 Oh, right.
00:10:28 Okay.
00:10:29 I'm following it.
00:10:30 Law.
00:10:31 Anyway, Disneyland is from what I hear just like shittier Disney world, but fuck you.
00:10:35 You even have the magic castle, you cuck.
00:10:38 What are you doing?
00:10:39 We have the magic castle.
00:10:41 You got a cheap imitation.
00:10:42 It doesn't have Walt Disney's body frozen inside.
00:10:44 Okay.
00:10:45 It's not the real magic castle.
00:10:46 True, true.
00:10:47 Okay.
00:10:48 The best part about Disneyland is how they literally like emotionally manipulate you
00:10:53 on every conceivable level, physical and emotional.
00:10:57 They like, they like have like, like different smells that they emanate from their fucking
00:11:01 carnices.
00:11:02 Yeah.
00:11:03 Like, like, like every single restaurant has at least one dead body inside emanating
00:11:07 delicious smells for you to.
00:11:09 Delicious pheromones.
00:11:10 Yeah.
00:11:11 Dude, look.
00:11:12 I've read this in a book in the game, game design book of lenses book by Jesse Shield,
00:11:16 a guy who worked at Disney.
00:11:17 He was saying that when they were making Disneyland, Walt Disney was like looking around like,
00:11:21 you know, like pointing at people like, okay, go there.
00:11:23 Okay.
00:11:24 That right.
00:11:25 Put that one there.
00:11:26 You know, that kind of shit.
00:11:27 Then sometimes he would bend down on his knees and then kind of like hobble around a little
00:11:30 bit.
00:11:31 People were like, why you hobble on your knees?
00:11:32 And he's like, I got to know what this park looks like from the perspective of a kid.
00:11:37 And it's like, oh shit.
00:11:38 That's so cool.
00:11:39 Genius.
00:11:40 In the fucking dirt.
00:11:41 He's just going to like a wheelchair or something, dude.
00:11:43 Are you going to like hop on a lady's back so you can see what it's like from a baby?
00:11:47 Like, what the fuck?
00:11:48 Yeah.
00:11:49 Why not just take two barrels of a shotgun and blow off your fucking calves and then
00:11:52 you're, you know, a couple feet shorter.
00:11:53 I know you really should do that.
00:11:54 He just, he just doesn't understand the hardships to come.
00:11:57 He needs to get serious.
00:11:58 He needs to get serious about that shit.
00:11:59 Get your fucking head in the game Walt Disney.
00:12:02 Jesus Christ.
00:12:03 What I was going to ask is, I mean, so the Undertaler, right?
00:12:07 He's a staple of the Disneyland experience as I understand it.
00:12:13 Every time I go there and I want, you know, you know, I think I'm going to go, okay, I'm
00:12:16 going to go, I'm going to go to Adventureland.
00:12:17 I'm going to get on Splash Mound and then I think, oh wait.
00:12:20 And then I like walk near and he's like, oh my Jesus.
00:12:23 I'm so good to see you.
00:12:25 Is he like a mascot?
00:12:27 The Undertaler is like, he's the Casey Neistat of Disneyland.
00:12:31 Yeah.
00:12:32 He defines the culture of that area.
00:12:36 I believe like the Undertaler is like a mascot at Disneyland.
00:12:39 I remember seeing in the news one time that like one, like Mickey Mouse mascot at like
00:12:43 Disney World like touched a 13 year old girl's like chest right before a photo shoot.
00:12:48 And so he got arrested.
00:12:49 I think the Undertaler gets arrested if he doesn't molest the kid he's taking a picture
00:12:53 with.
00:12:54 Guys, just keep your ear to the ground for when Disney buys the Undertale copyright
00:12:59 rights.
00:13:00 Keep your ear that there are, that there are fucking developments being made at Disneyland
00:13:05 for a Undertale ride one day.
00:13:08 When the PCP gets like 15 billion subscribers and then we get bought out by Disney, then
00:13:14 they're going to have full rights to the Undertaler character and they're going to be able to,
00:13:17 you know, use him in whatever disgusting wicked ways they see fit by making him a cleaner,
00:13:22 more socially adjusted person.
00:13:24 It's going to be a complete perversion of the original vision of the character.
00:13:29 By the way, next time I go to Disneyland, I'm going to piss my pants so I can really get
00:13:33 into the shoes of the Undertaler.
00:13:34 I can really see what it's all about.
00:13:35 It's like performance art.
00:13:36 It's like performance art.
00:13:37 That's real Gonzo journalism.
00:13:38 Yeah.
00:13:39 The Undertaler is definitely the pissed Gonzo journalist.
00:13:47 He really just has to live it and, you know, write about it as he sees fit.
00:13:53 Okay.
00:13:54 All right.
00:13:55 But no more fucking around.
00:13:56 Undertaler, get out of my way.
00:13:58 Oh, I'm in the acid now.
00:14:00 There's new acid rides at Disneyland.
00:14:02 In case you didn't know.
00:14:05 The fucking best part about Disneyland, I don't know if this is even in world, is the giant
00:14:09 turkey legs.
00:14:10 The turkey legs are fucking huge and like the size of my head and every time I go there,
00:14:16 I eat like two and I literally barf every single time and it's what I want.
00:14:21 I legitimately throw up at Disneyland every single time I go.
00:14:25 Every single time.
00:14:27 I don't know how meme-y you're being, but that seems to be the perfect technique.
00:14:30 No.
00:14:31 I'm not any.
00:14:32 I do it all the time.
00:14:35 Every single time because I just want to eat all the turkey legs because they're so big.
00:14:40 They're so big.
00:14:41 One of the theme parks I always go to, it has like these really awesome giant turkey legs
00:14:45 and I remember like a picture of me as a kid with my brother with those giant disproportionately
00:14:50 huge turkey legs.
00:14:51 Where the fuck do they genetically engineer these Titan turkeys?
00:14:54 That's what I was going to ask because I never got a turkey leg in an amusement park, but
00:14:58 I feel like there's just amusement park staple food which includes those giant turkey legs
00:15:03 because whenever King Richard's Faire is a big Massachusetts, or is it in Connecticut?
00:15:08 Yeah, it's in Massachusetts like a big medieval festival that happens every year or whatever
00:15:13 and Renaissance Faire, that's where I'm looking for.
00:15:15 Yeah, and it's like they sell the giant turkey legs and they also sell them in Disneyland.
00:15:20 Is there like some menu that like all amusement parks order from?
00:15:24 I mean personally, my favorite was always the clam chowder bread bowls.
00:15:28 Those are my personal favorite of all time.
00:15:30 Clam chowder bread bowl is an amusement park food?
00:15:32 Yeah, I've never, that's fucking crazy.
00:15:34 Well that's what I was going to say because I know I get them at King Richard's Faire
00:15:37 when I go, but I've never gotten them in an amusement park.
00:15:39 Yeah, I don't see anybody at Disneyland or the bowl of soup.
00:15:42 Fucking knight and kings and fucking bars did not have a clam chowder, you goddamn fucking bitch.
00:15:49 My question is, what's everybody's thoughts on funnel cake?
00:15:52 Because I personally fucking hate it.
00:15:54 I love funnel cake with strawberries and whipped cream on it.
00:15:57 Oh, it's my favorite.
00:15:59 Is that the cake that you put in a funnel in those deviant art comics?
00:16:06 Is that what they do?
00:16:08 Oh shit.
00:16:09 It's like a weird grid of batter that they deep fry.
00:16:13 It really is a grid.
00:16:14 It's like if you have stringy diarrhea and you deep fry it and then cover it in powdered sugar.
00:16:19 That's what a funnel cake is.
00:16:20 I've never seen this before in my fucking life.
00:16:22 This is the worst thing I've ever been subjected to.
00:16:25 It's pretty good.
00:16:26 It's like, let me think, how to describe it?
00:16:28 Yeah, just imagine cake, but imagine it fried instead of whatever.
00:16:32 It's just a very light, fluffy fry.
00:16:34 Imagine if French fries were sweet instead of salty and never stopped.
00:16:39 It was just a giant spaghetti.
00:16:42 It's called sweet potato fries and those are good.
00:16:44 What does funnel cake have to do with amusement parks?
00:16:47 Because they're amusement parks, according to me and Nate.
00:16:49 And you guys are all wrong, I guess.
00:16:50 It's one of the staple foods, yeah.
00:16:52 Well, actually, they sell those and then they sell...
00:16:54 Shit, what are they called?
00:16:55 These are actually, you see them a lot at baseball games as well or like football games.
00:16:59 Oh, they're called hot dogs.
00:17:00 They're just like...
00:17:01 Not a fucking hot dog.
00:17:02 Well, that too, but like...
00:17:03 Heroes.
00:17:04 It's like a funnel cake.
00:17:05 You may have heard them, they're called hamburgers.
00:17:07 God damn it.
00:17:08 What the fuck is this thing?
00:17:09 It's just like a funnel cake.
00:17:10 No, god damn it.
00:17:12 It's called cup of water.
00:17:13 It's like a funnel cake, but it's like one piece.
00:17:16 Barefoot.
00:17:17 It's just a thing.
00:17:18 Fuck it.
00:17:19 Fuck it.
00:17:20 Okay, alright.
00:17:21 Alright, that's enough talking for you one day.
00:17:23 You just go ahead and get back in the cage real quick here on the big boys' talk.
00:17:28 The actual best food ever made outside of any, you know, like not just relegated to amusement parks,
00:17:35 but they're generally inside of it.
00:17:36 Before like, when extinct were Dippin' Dots.
00:17:39 Dippin' Dots were the only fucking food I loved in my entire life.
00:17:42 Yeah, those were at their parks too.
00:17:44 Why do you see they're extinct?
00:17:45 Like, I still have them at Walmart down here.
00:17:47 What?
00:17:48 Yeah, monkey me too.
00:17:49 We have them at Walmart, yeah.
00:17:51 Okay, okay.
00:17:52 Well, over here, they used to be like at McDonald's.
00:17:55 They used to be like at every single fucking store.
00:17:57 They used to be everywhere.
00:17:58 They're like popular mainstreamies.
00:17:59 I used to always get them.
00:18:00 Let me tell you.
00:18:01 But now, I don't see them anywhere.
00:18:02 Okay, I was down at my favorite amusement park the other day, the Creationist Museum.
00:18:07 Not a joke.
00:18:08 Is that the Ken Ham one?
00:18:11 What's his name?
00:18:12 Ken Ham or Ken Bone?
00:18:13 I always mix them up.
00:18:14 Maybe Ken Ham.
00:18:15 It's the one in Kentucky that's like nearby.
00:18:17 So it's whatever that one is.
00:18:18 The guy who debated Bill Nye way back in the days before Bill Nye was a cook.
00:18:21 Ken Bone is the really cool, funny XD presidential election.
00:18:26 But the point is, it's clearly superior to Disneyland because they did have Dippin' Dots.
00:18:31 They had old Dippin' Dots booths.
00:18:33 What the?
00:18:34 You can start around me.
00:18:35 No, here's the thing with Dippin' Dots, though, is that they have to be like in a super, super
00:18:39 cold freezer.
00:18:40 They have to build special freezers just to keep them from melting.
00:18:43 So it's like too much of a liability to have them because they keep fucking melting.
00:18:46 The theme park guy.
00:18:47 Because they got too many kids wandering in there and freezing to death.
00:18:49 It's just a big, you know.
00:18:51 And then they try to burn down the restaurant.
00:18:53 It's like a whole boot.
00:18:54 It's crazy.
00:18:55 Yeah, like the Dippin' Dots at the theme park I went to, they were like everywhere.
00:19:00 Every couple of street paths, you run into one.
00:19:03 And like, my family has always been very conservative with money when we go to one.
00:19:07 So it's just a constant tease.
00:19:09 And so I never actually had them.
00:19:10 But they looked cool.
00:19:11 Ice cream of the future.
00:19:12 Goddamn it, I've seen them here for like seven years.
00:19:14 How long can the future go?
00:19:16 Yeah.
00:19:17 Hey, remember Dibs that were like a bucket full of like these little individual ice cream
00:19:21 things?
00:19:22 Oh yeah.
00:19:23 Dibs?
00:19:24 Yeah, they're like covered in chocolate that you guys are talking about.
00:19:26 Dibs are everywhere for me.
00:19:28 Sorry dude, this is Food of the Future.
00:19:30 All we're going to be eating here in 20-30.
00:19:33 Yeah.
00:19:34 You better get woke.
00:19:35 Basically nothing in this podcast so far has like run true.
00:19:38 Like, oh yeah, I know that.
00:19:39 Like nothing.
00:19:40 Well, what do they have in their lives over there?
00:19:42 I haven't ever walked before and seen a funny fucking clown juggle out of them.
00:19:46 Do they have like a fucking crime rib and steak over at your music park?
00:19:50 Oh yes, it's me.
00:19:52 The average English nine-year-old child.
00:19:55 Oh, I shall have my pride.
00:19:57 I shall have my starline with my sword with my elbow.
00:20:02 We have fuck off.
00:20:03 Candy floss.
00:20:04 Candy to me.
00:20:05 Get out of here.
00:20:06 That sounds like the least healthy thing for your teeth of all time.
00:20:09 Oh wait.
00:20:10 No, you call it...
00:20:11 That explains a few things.
00:20:13 You call it cotton candy.
00:20:15 That's right.
00:20:16 We call it candy floss.
00:20:17 I guess because it gets stuck in your teeth.
00:20:19 That's the joke.
00:20:20 Oh shit.
00:20:21 It just melts on your tongue, you sick fuck.
00:20:23 Guys, who else has this crazy moment of finding out all at once
00:20:26 that cotton candy is called something different in other places
00:20:29 and in other places it's called it so pervasively
00:20:32 that a local had to spend five seconds remembering the word for cotton candy.
00:20:35 I had no idea it wasn't called that everywhere.
00:20:37 That's fucking crazy.
00:20:38 Yeah, that's fucking crazy.
00:20:39 That's like the biggest, most crazy one I've experienced in like many years.
00:20:42 I thought I knew all the ones.
00:20:44 I guess if you say we have cotton candy too, dunk ass, and then do that emoji.
00:20:50 Okay, Kim, tell us more.
00:20:52 What's England like with this shit?
00:20:54 Well, I'm very easily amused, so...
00:20:58 Everywhere's an amusing park if I try hard, no.
00:21:01 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:21:02 Like a regular park will do me just fine.
00:21:05 But I haven't been to many and usually when I have
00:21:10 it's like been part of a school thing or like a family thing.
00:21:13 But like, hey kids, since you've been good
00:21:16 we're going on a school trip to Thorpe Park
00:21:19 or Chessington World of Adventures.
00:21:21 I'm like, clean.
00:21:22 These parks sound like work.
00:21:24 Why do they sound like homework textbooks?
00:21:26 I know, I feel like America's a lot more densely packed with amusement parks
00:21:32 because they're just not more everywhere.
00:21:34 I only know those two.
00:21:36 I only know those two and then Legoland.
00:21:39 And then there's a bunch of zoos.
00:21:41 Six Flags Adventures.
00:21:42 No Six Flags, no Disneyland.
00:21:45 You don't know about Six Flags, no?
00:21:46 I know about it.
00:21:47 It's got that, the both of them.
00:22:03 I actually have a picture of 12 year old me posing with the dancing old man
00:22:06 because I went for Six Flags when he was there.
00:22:08 Oh my god!
00:22:10 You have to put that.
00:22:12 I don't remember, but I'll try to find it.
00:22:14 It might be on my old, old Facebook account
00:22:16 that I'll have to reactivate and dig through,
00:22:18 but I'll fucking do it.
00:22:19 Why did they let a monkey into a theme park?
00:22:22 He was working there.
00:22:24 We all know that monkeys work in an amusement park.
00:22:27 Please, please put that on screen right now.
00:22:30 Be insane.
00:22:31 If I find it.
00:22:33 By the way, cool thing about Chessington World of Adventures
00:22:36 is that the land has a literal castle on it
00:22:41 because the people own the estate.
00:22:43 I knew it, I knew it.
00:22:45 You are castles.
00:22:47 We have more castles than amusement parks.
00:22:49 I'm pretty sure.
00:22:50 So turning actual history into a,
00:22:53 this whole fucking castle has no history.
00:22:55 It's not part of the park.
00:22:57 Yeah, fuck the Native Americans, know what I'm saying?
00:22:59 It's just sort of on the hill
00:23:01 and it's the people who own the land own the castle
00:23:04 and you can sort of go up to it,
00:23:06 but I don't think you can go in.
00:23:08 I haven't tried, but yeah.
00:23:10 One of the two theme parks, they're always near me,
00:23:12 is sort of based on a history thing,
00:23:14 but I'll get into that later, tease for the future.
00:23:16 You knock on the castle door.
00:23:18 Where's my starline?
00:23:20 Starline, I ordered it in the area 35 minutes ago
00:23:23 and I'm starting to get queasy.
00:23:25 All right folks, we've talked about the food.
00:23:29 But I've got some insight for you
00:23:31 because I famously worked for a summer at an amusement park.
00:23:34 So let's talk a little bit about the rides.
00:23:36 Yes, finally the main event.
00:23:39 Let me ask you, how much training do you think
00:23:42 each 16-year-old worker gets
00:23:44 before operating this giant piece of machinery
00:23:47 that they're responsible for the lives of all the people on them?
00:23:50 Yeah, how much training do you think I got
00:23:52 for every ride?
00:23:54 There's a reason the most popular undergraduate degree
00:23:57 in the world is amusement park ride operation.
00:23:59 So, you know, good four years.
00:24:02 Moku, are you a carny specifically?
00:24:04 I want to believe that you were a carny clown.
00:24:06 I want to believe you were a fortune teller.
00:24:09 Maybe. I mean, I just operated the rides
00:24:12 but I did predict some future events.
00:24:15 Okay.
00:24:17 So, how'd it go down Moku?
00:24:19 So, the way my amusement park worked,
00:24:21 which I worked at Adventureland,
00:24:23 which is in some city in Iowa, I forget the city,
00:24:26 somewhere around Des Moines,
00:24:28 they didn't want you to get bored at any one ride.
00:24:31 So every single week you would get trained for a different ride
00:24:34 and then do that ride for the whole week
00:24:36 and then move on to the next one.
00:24:38 So by the end of the summer, I had pretty much operated
00:24:40 every ride in the park, which is kind of cool
00:24:42 because then I knew how they all worked.
00:24:44 That sounds like a good idea, yeah.
00:24:46 But, like, you know, you work Monday through Sunday
00:24:48 or whatever the fuck, and the Monday morning,
00:24:50 they give you about five to ten minutes
00:24:52 like telling you how to do the ride,
00:24:54 and then that's it.
00:24:56 And then you just like on your own for the whole week
00:24:58 and you're like a fucking 16 or 17 year old kid.
00:25:00 Awesome.
00:25:02 Did anything go wrong?
00:25:04 Not for me.
00:25:06 Well, that's the thing.
00:25:08 It's always fun because, like,
00:25:10 you're 16 and there's no responsibility.
00:25:12 So you can just, like, tell kids in line
00:25:14 who are waiting like, you know how many kids died
00:25:16 in this ride yesterday, man?
00:25:18 I just got done cleaning the blood off the seats, dude.
00:25:20 Yeah, it's pretty...
00:25:22 Did you actually redo that?
00:25:24 Of course I did. Of course I did.
00:25:26 You're not a carny unless you tell the kids that
00:25:28 another kid died on the ride.
00:25:30 I agree.
00:25:32 Number one dream in life was to become a carny.
00:25:34 That's what he trained day and night for.
00:25:36 But something strange about it
00:25:38 is that I guess amusement parks have
00:25:40 like a weird thing with the child labor laws
00:25:42 because, like, even if you're under 16,
00:25:44 like, 14 year olds were allowed to work
00:25:46 like the restaurants and shit.
00:25:48 Oh, what the fuck?
00:25:50 Yeah, but the thing is, like,
00:25:52 there was no restriction on how many hours.
00:25:54 Like, I was a wee lad
00:25:56 and I was working like 55 hours a week.
00:25:58 Maybe it's because it's like a seasonal job
00:26:00 and, like, there's like a special thing with it.
00:26:02 But, like, I was there
00:26:04 because the morning shift was 5 hours
00:26:06 and the night shift was 7.
00:26:08 And I would just work both because why the fuck not?
00:26:10 I drove all the way there.
00:26:12 So I'd be working, like, you know, 12 hour days,
00:26:14 6 days a week.
00:26:16 And I don't know why they're allowed to do that
00:26:18 for people who are not adults.
00:26:20 It's weird.
00:26:22 That's a very good question.
00:26:24 Y'all need to unionize.
00:26:26 They need a leader.
00:26:28 They need a union-leadered monkey.
00:26:30 You're the man for the job.
00:26:32 Oh, yeah.
00:26:34 Well, I think Unes, I think Monkey Jones.
00:26:36 Instantly.
00:26:38 Elliot Roger did nothing wrong.
00:26:40 That's the platform.
00:26:42 That's what he sounds like, dude.
00:26:44 Sweet Monkey Jones.
00:26:46 See, I'm going to make a new Elliot Roger video.
00:26:48 The cowards will eat it up.
00:26:50 Monkey, did you ever get mumbly?
00:26:52 Mumbly all the time?
00:26:54 Because that's the number one thing.
00:26:56 I'm thinking, how many times do they think
00:26:58 when they start a new day or a new week
00:27:00 thinking, you know what,
00:27:02 I'm going to clearly enunciate
00:27:04 the instructions for this ride
00:27:06 and how many times, how many loops
00:27:08 can they go on before they give up
00:27:10 and just be like, put your hands in the blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:27:12 Oh, I see what you're saying.
00:27:14 Now, I mean, it's like the same
00:27:16 sends over and over again.
00:27:18 It's not too hard.
00:27:20 There was one ride at a theme park
00:27:22 and a fucking pre-recorded thing
00:27:24 by a professional.
00:27:26 It was like, keep your hands in the sea
00:27:28 at all times.
00:27:30 I was like, holy shit, this is great.
00:27:32 You can hear it perfectly.
00:27:34 It's way more pleasant to listen to
00:27:36 because it's with an actual microphone
00:27:38 and they got rid of it at some point
00:27:40 and went back to the mumbly teenager
00:27:42 and I'm like, I don't blame them.
00:27:44 This is a broken system.
00:27:46 Why not use pre-recordings?
00:27:48 Dude, that was the best.
00:27:50 Disneyland is broken up in two parks.
00:27:52 One is actually Disneyland and then there's a sister park.
00:27:54 It's like across the fucking...
00:27:56 You just walk two seconds and then you get into another one.
00:27:58 It's called California Adventure.
00:28:00 There's a ride that's called a Soren over California.
00:28:02 Something in that effect.
00:28:04 In fact, David Putty from Seinfeld
00:28:06 walks out and he's in this fucking snazzy
00:28:08 pouts outfit and he's like, it's me, David Putty.
00:28:10 Fucking keep your fucking
00:28:12 slut hands to yourself, bitch.
00:28:14 And then he slams the door on your face
00:28:16 and then you get this cool
00:28:18 like AMV of real life
00:28:20 while you jam the fuck out
00:28:22 and like fly.
00:28:24 AMV of real life.
00:28:26 There was one ride called, I don't know,
00:28:28 some generic crazy scientist name.
00:28:30 It's one of those indoor rides
00:28:32 that has all these crazy lighting effects
00:28:34 and it spins you around a bunch.
00:28:36 But the line to the ride is also indoors
00:28:38 and it's got this TV
00:28:40 that played this intro sequence
00:28:42 and it's got several minutes
00:28:44 of intro of world building
00:28:46 and it's very built the invention
00:28:48 and like what he did and how he did it
00:28:50 and what it's all about and what the ride is
00:28:52 and like, but you can't hear any of it
00:28:54 because it's too crowded and loud
00:28:56 but I was like, why'd they fill all this shit?
00:28:58 I know what you're saying, but I think
00:29:00 I know what they're aspiring to when they do that
00:29:02 because like the best atmosphere
00:29:04 of any ride I've ever been on
00:29:06 was the Tower of Terror in Disney World.
00:29:08 Yeah.
00:29:10 Which has this grand buildup, you're in this hotel
00:29:12 and they're like, oh, these are the guests
00:29:14 and like the line is so fucking long
00:29:16 like you get plenty of time to watch
00:29:18 the whole story as it unfolds on the TVs around you
00:29:20 and the whole place is like decked out
00:29:22 there's bell hops fucking each other
00:29:24 in the corners and shit.
00:29:26 The atmosphere is perfect
00:29:28 and then it builds up and like the same voice
00:29:30 that we use for the narrator is like
00:29:32 as you're finally on the ride and it lifts you up
00:29:34 and you're looking out at the park through the cracks
00:29:36 and like the broken down walls of the hotel
00:29:38 it's like goodbye and then
00:29:40 you go falling as the fucking ride kicks off
00:29:42 and it's such a great atmospheric adventure
00:29:44 that was so fucking great.
00:29:46 Two points on that.
00:29:48 First of all, the Tower of Terror is literally the best ride up
00:29:50 they fucking removed it
00:29:52 they removed it from Disneyland
00:29:54 they got rid of it.
00:29:56 What about Disney World?
00:29:58 Well, I don't know about Disney World
00:30:00 but I don't care about that because it's probably gay.
00:30:02 Anyway, and fucking Disneyland, the Tower of Terror
00:30:04 was like the coolest fucking thing ever
00:30:06 and it was like it was in California Adventure
00:30:08 because it was like oh fuck it, there's a California hotel
00:30:10 who would think they could make a Twilight Zone ride
00:30:12 and make it actually like cool
00:30:14 but you know what, they fucking removed it
00:30:16 and it was like iconic, it was iconic
00:30:18 everyone loved the Tower of Terror, it was fucking incredible.
00:30:20 I forgot that, that makes it even better
00:30:22 but I will say
00:30:24 hold on, they removed it
00:30:26 and they placed it with a fucking
00:30:28 Guardians of the Galaxy
00:30:32 It's Nate, you haven't seen
00:30:34 either movie so you don't get it grown
00:30:36 first of all.
00:30:38 It's one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces
00:30:40 of the small screen of all time, I know that much.
00:30:42 Isn't it the movie where Max Landis' dad killed
00:30:44 two people in Cold Blood?
00:30:46 I'm not talking about the Rod Sterling show
00:30:48 that's what I'm talking about.
00:30:50 I know about no movie.
00:30:52 I've got a Rod Sterling for you, Wing.
00:30:54 Well okay, so as much as I love that
00:30:56 that's not my favorite ride of all time
00:30:58 okay, my favorite ride of all time
00:31:00 is in a little place you might have heard of
00:31:02 called Tokyo Nippon, alright
00:31:04 and I rode this every single day
00:31:06 called the subway system
00:31:08 of Tokyo, Japan
00:31:10 so you get on this thing
00:31:12 and they really create atmosphere
00:31:14 there's all these slant-eyed actors looking at you
00:31:16 there's obviously something
00:31:18 there's all these yellows
00:31:20 I appreciate the commitment of the character
00:31:22 of these fucked up individuals
00:31:24 and the little announcer is like
00:31:26 ah, Denwa, doors are now closing
00:31:28 you fat American fuck
00:31:30 and I'm like yeah, thanks dude, I get it
00:31:32 and then I ride, I ride, I ride
00:31:34 I've experienced it my whole life, I did it every day
00:31:36 several times a day, it was cheap as fuck
00:31:38 I wish I lived somewhere where there was a subway
00:31:40 so I could do it again, I love subways
00:31:42 Subways are my favorite amusement park ride
00:31:44 I like thrilling rides, Nate, but I like scarier rides
00:31:46 I'm trying to buy all those ghouls
00:31:48 and freaks, I might make my heart pound
00:31:50 a little bit too fast there
00:31:52 I think you might be going a little bit to
00:31:54 an over the line there
00:31:56 that's understandable
00:31:58 escalator land
00:32:00 when do we get to the ride
00:32:02 is the ride
00:32:04 yippee
00:32:06 what a classic
00:32:08 incredible, thank you
00:32:10 did anybody else think that show was called fairy god
00:32:12 parents and not fairly odd parents
00:32:14 that's fucking bullshit
00:32:16 I was playing a Nickelodeon trivia game
00:32:18 and the question was like what's the show
00:32:20 with Timmy and I was like oh that's fucking
00:32:22 fairy god parents dude and I got it wrong
00:32:24 cause it was fairly odd parents
00:32:26 fucking bullshit name
00:32:28 Timmy was an average kid
00:32:30 that oh I don't understand
00:32:32 mom and dad and vicki
00:32:34 only give me names
00:32:36 and then he went to fucking go
00:32:38 and get his garden
00:32:40 and then we practiced
00:32:42 and then he was shot
00:32:44 and then we went to school
00:32:46 there was no parents
00:32:48 there was no parents
00:32:50 did you guys see that they changed the theme song
00:32:52 cause they have a new female character
00:32:54 who is sharing the fairy god parents
00:32:56 with Timmy and it's fucking terrible
00:32:58 I haven't seen it but I heard about it
00:33:00 okay, alright, Gib was saying something
00:33:02 what would you say Gib
00:33:04 I was gonna start talking about my favorite ride
00:33:06 which
00:33:08 they're probably like all the rides I've ever been on
00:33:10 are probably worse than all American ones
00:33:12 just because
00:33:14 you know, I don't know
00:33:16 it's probably smaller I assume
00:33:18 I assume everything in America is like 10 feet
00:33:20 taller than everything in England
00:33:22 yeah, that's right
00:33:24 like people included
00:33:26 as I've encountered
00:33:28 alright, guys
00:33:30 we're gonna get back to the whole thing of discussing
00:33:32 everybody's favorite deep berks
00:33:34 hey, hip-hop is talking
00:33:36 sorry, I had to go do a thing
00:33:38 for a minute and had to come back
00:33:40 and re-announce myself
00:33:42 why would you
00:33:44 what did you think we were doing
00:33:46 what did you think we were doing
00:33:48 theme songs
00:33:50 you shouldn't open with
00:33:52 fair enough
00:33:54 anyway, um, yeah
00:33:56 I love Davoo
00:33:58 I've never been into roller coasters
00:34:00 they scare me, especially
00:34:02 even the one at Legoland, like there's a one at Legoland
00:34:04 where it's a green
00:34:06 green
00:34:08 yeah dude
00:34:10 it was the first one I ever made myself go on
00:34:12 and I tensed up
00:34:14 my whole body so that I basically
00:34:16 blacked out and I couldn't see and I died
00:34:18 but it was really cool
00:34:20 but later in my life
00:34:22 when I had glasses
00:34:24 and I was at this theme
00:34:26 I was at Thorpe Park for like
00:34:28 the end of school year
00:34:30 hey kids, we're taking you to
00:34:32 we're taking you to a thing
00:34:34 and everyone's like, yeah
00:34:36 it's cool, we're all friends
00:34:38 and I'm like, oh no, I don't have those
00:34:40 but this will be the moment
00:34:42 this will be the time in my life
00:34:44 when I can have the cool day out
00:34:46 with everyone and become cool
00:34:48 and it was alright
00:34:50 but I was too scared to go on the rides
00:34:52 because I'd never really tried them
00:34:54 and I hate it
00:34:56 so there was this one roller coaster
00:34:58 where I was like, I gotta do it with somebody
00:35:00 I gotta do it at some point, I just gotta do it
00:35:02 so I got onto this thing
00:35:04 and it's one of those rides where you like
00:35:06 your legs are dangling down below
00:35:08 and I got in
00:35:10 I was like fucking scared out of my mind
00:35:12 and we were going
00:35:14 and then one of the guys on my left
00:35:16 said, hey
00:35:18 you didn't put your glasses away
00:35:20 you got your glasses on
00:35:22 they're gonna fall off and I'm like
00:35:24 what? I didn't know that was gonna happen
00:35:26 so frantically
00:35:28 I was just trying to
00:35:30 you have the thing around your shoulders
00:35:32 my arms couldn't
00:35:34 really quite reach around
00:35:36 but I could just about get my pinky finger
00:35:38 wrapped around the rim of my glasses
00:35:40 and I was just holding on, I could feel it slipping off my face
00:35:42 and I was concentrating on that the whole time
00:35:44 and I was just scrunched up and like
00:35:46 weird and when we got through the end
00:35:48 I was just
00:35:50 so relieved that I managed to keep my glasses on
00:35:52 but then they had the picture come out
00:35:54 with like, here's you guys
00:35:56 and all these cool guys
00:35:58 they're like screaming with a big mouth
00:36:00 exactly how you're supposed to look
00:36:02 and there's me scrunched up, eyes closed
00:36:04 like a weird twisted
00:36:06 dead bug holding on to my little glasses
00:36:08 a freak, a monster
00:36:10 I looked disgusting and nobody said anything
00:36:12 but I knew, I was like
00:36:14 I've been there dude
00:36:16 I've been on those rides trying to hold on
00:36:18 my various eye-wares that I wear
00:36:20 all the time, yeah
00:36:22 that would be hard, you have to just duct tape them to your head
00:36:24 yeah, but that was cool
00:36:26 that got me okayed
00:36:28 with roller coasters but I think the
00:36:30 most fun I had was
00:36:32 recently this summer, I went
00:36:34 to one because
00:36:36 you may know, I do like
00:36:38 a yearly week
00:36:40 with helping disabled kids
00:36:42 there's like a week camp
00:36:44 and I do that stuff
00:36:46 it's about time Ben got that help that he needed
00:36:48 it's pretty rude that you call that a week camp
00:36:50 for these week people
00:36:52 it's a week long camp
00:36:54 and one of the days we go out
00:36:56 to a amusement park and
00:36:58 the last time I went, I think it was
00:37:00 Chessington World of Adventures
00:37:02 there's two in the whole of the UK
00:37:04 and we went to the second one
00:37:06 and there was like a virtual reality
00:37:08 3D headset ride
00:37:10 that was super fast and it was like planets exploding
00:37:12 with a
00:37:14 Cortana lady saying
00:37:16 you're going through, we're going to warp speed
00:37:18 now and I'm like, oh my goodness
00:37:20 whoa, it was great
00:37:22 because I didn't have to
00:37:24 look at the ground, I could just feel
00:37:26 like I was going through space
00:37:28 so that was good, I like that
00:37:30 it's interesting to see how VR
00:37:32 gets worked more into riots as we
00:37:34 move into our future because the whole point
00:37:36 of an amusement ride to begin with is to
00:37:38 simulate the feeling of death
00:37:40 that's what they're really for, to make you terrified
00:37:42 your core and think, I'm about to die
00:37:44 and you get that dopamine rush to your brain
00:37:46 which we enjoy, so if we could just do that
00:37:48 sitting on our asses through VR
00:37:50 then it'd be a lot cheaper
00:37:52 the moment that we get that, the whole issue
00:37:54 with theme parks is that people are slowly
00:37:56 realizing that there's just not much fun
00:37:58 to be had that you can't just have in your bedroom
00:38:00 on the internet
00:38:02 I would say
00:38:04 that ride is the perfect
00:38:06 and only good usage of a VR headset
00:38:08 I've ever seen
00:38:10 you were flying through the air
00:38:12 you could feel the wind
00:38:14 buffeting your whole body
00:38:16 there's no wind in space
00:38:18 so how could that be true
00:38:20 we were all thinking that
00:38:22 I think that it'll always be
00:38:24 as long as human beings have physical bodies
00:38:26 and are basically the same creature that we are now
00:38:28 which might not always be the case
00:38:30 but while we are something like an amusement park
00:38:32 we'll always have a utility
00:38:34 just for the sake of changing your surroundings
00:38:36 sometimes I mean I spend all fucking
00:38:38 day looking at my computer and working and shit
00:38:40 in the exact same like 3 foot
00:38:42 location at all times
00:38:44 either at home or at work
00:38:46 and to just divert
00:38:48 from that for a time and go somewhere else
00:38:50 and do something that's just out of the norm
00:38:52 God it feels good
00:38:54 God I love it
00:38:56 I sort of joked earlier about like a normal park
00:38:58 being just enough for me
00:39:00 I'm easily amused but it's kind of true
00:39:02 just a change of environment
00:39:04 is really nice
00:39:06 and the thing with actual parks
00:39:08 is that there's not that many people in them
00:39:10 amusement parks
00:39:12 scare me with the
00:39:14 huge crowds
00:39:16 I'm not good with the huge crowds
00:39:18 I have many memories
00:39:20 I have a lot of memories of getting
00:39:22 separated from brothers or family members
00:39:24 or friends and stuff
00:39:26 and not being the one
00:39:28 with the map and being like
00:39:30 I mean I'm just gonna die
00:39:32 I'm just gonna walk
00:39:34 to dino land and jump
00:39:36 into a mouth
00:39:38 Speaking of crowds
00:39:40 there was one crowd related story
00:39:42 it's actually the opposite of what you're saying
00:39:44 but there was one time when my family
00:39:46 we all went to Six Flags, New England
00:39:48 in Springfield, Massachusetts
00:39:50 and so it was like
00:39:52 the end of the day I don't remember what day it was
00:39:54 but for whatever reason it wasn't a very full day
00:39:56 but at the very end of the
00:39:58 day as the place was closing down
00:40:00 it was like 6pm or something I think
00:40:02 I think it closes kind of early whatever day that was
00:40:04 so we happened to be there and like nobody was there
00:40:06 and me and my dad were just like
00:40:08 you know what we went on the Superman roller coaster
00:40:10 instantly one of the greatest roller coasters in the world
00:40:12 everyone should ride it
00:40:14 it's super fun that big
00:40:16 dive at the very beginning
00:40:18 but the point is
00:40:20 me and my dad went on it
00:40:22 and we realized after we got out
00:40:24 then we came back we were like let's do it again before we leave
00:40:26 at the end of the day so we went at it again
00:40:28 and we realized there's literally no line
00:40:30 let's just do it again
00:40:32 and so we did it again three full
00:40:34 times over and over again on this roller coaster
00:40:36 well I'm sure the people running it
00:40:38 rolled their eyes they're like oh look at these
00:40:40 look at these cool customers riding the same ride
00:40:42 a million times but fuck them
00:40:44 me and my dad had so much fun on that ride
00:40:46 it was fucking fantastic I love
00:40:48 Superman and that roller coaster
00:40:50 it was great so crowds can get fucked
00:40:52 I hope everyone dies
00:40:54 Isis I've got a couple targets
00:40:56 for you mapped out on my map here
00:40:58 some places where a lot of people gather
00:41:00 you can just clear them out for me
00:41:02 it'd be very convenient for me
00:41:04 let's make that happen
00:41:06 ride a roller coaster three times is a pretty good exchange
00:41:08 for not having locks on your doors
00:41:10 fair bargain
00:41:12 what are you getting at
00:41:14 I'm not getting at anything
00:41:16 oh
00:41:18 we're gonna say our favorite
00:41:20 T-Tarks
00:41:22 let's do that
00:41:24 I forgot to mention the reason I brought up
00:41:26 the like thing with the
00:41:28 VR thing
00:41:30 the reason I brought up the disabled kids thing
00:41:32 was because I had to go
00:41:34 on the ride with them otherwise
00:41:36 I'm a helper I can't
00:41:38 they were fine the person I was with
00:41:40 they were having a blast
00:41:42 could you imagine being so retarded you can't sit down
00:41:44 and get buckled in
00:41:46 I can't imagine
00:41:48 those kids didn't
00:41:50 it's hard to deal with kids
00:41:52 people who are retarded literally mean slow
00:41:54 so they're like deal with kids
00:41:56 you go fast because they're on the ride
00:42:00 yes
00:42:02 that's true
00:42:04 we're bringing them up to speed baby
00:42:06 oh yes
00:42:08 I don't have a favorite theme park
00:42:10 by the way because I'm gay
00:42:12 no wait Legoland
00:42:14 that's the one
00:42:16 you do Legoland
00:42:18 I also
00:42:20 it's a toss up between Legoland and Disneyland for me
00:42:22 I also love Universal Studios
00:42:24 my least favorite is by far SeaWorld
00:42:26 super fucking boring
00:42:28 and they don't let you get to see them
00:42:30 torture the animals they do it behind the scenes
00:42:32 they don't like you to see it
00:42:34 ever since they stopped murdering Shamu for our enjoyment
00:42:36 that place has really gone down
00:42:38 I want to see blood in the fucking water
00:42:40 she deserves it
00:42:42 but what always upset me is I would always think
00:42:44 like SeaWorld
00:42:46 water park vlogs
00:42:48 I want to go there
00:42:50 we haven't even got to water parks
00:42:52 that's going to be the whole park tour of this podcast
00:42:54 I would always want to go there
00:42:56 I would always want to go there
00:42:58 to get wet but then I would like
00:43:00 there's like no wet
00:43:02 you need kind of wet like Shamu can like splash you
00:43:04 but like I don't know
00:43:06 I want to get dripping I want to get sloppy
00:43:08 I want to get mushy
00:43:10 that's what I want but I couldn't do it
00:43:12 I wouldn't think of SeaWorld as a water park
00:43:14 I think of it as like a fucking aquarium
00:43:16 yeah it's pretty much an aquarium
00:43:18 it's just supposed to but I don't know
00:43:20 I want to see the fucking
00:43:22 guys just okay everybody
00:43:24 alright take a journey with me everybody
00:43:26 just close your eyes
00:43:28 and think back to when you were like
00:43:30 14 years old
00:43:32 it's the summer time the sun's beaten down
00:43:34 that was like 10 days ago from Munch
00:43:36 I know
00:43:38 you're on a class trip everybody
00:43:40 you're wearing your swim trunks you got your t-shirt on
00:43:42 you're going on rides
00:43:44 you're checking out your 14 year old classmates
00:43:46 with their burgeoning titties
00:43:48 you're looking at what they got
00:43:50 you're hanging out with all your friends
00:43:52 it's nice and warm
00:43:54 you're getting the fucking ice cream from the vendors
00:43:56 you're going on rides and shit
00:43:58 you're spilling them everywhere but it doesn't matter
00:44:00 because you just go in the lazy river
00:44:02 and you chill with your buddies
00:44:04 and you're hanging out there for an hour
00:44:06 as you just lazily drift
00:44:08 it's the most fun you've ever had in your fucking life
00:44:10 this is what I'm getting at
00:44:12 water parks are the greatest thing in the world
00:44:14 I love water parks intensely
00:44:16 I love the lazy river
00:44:18 I was born in a lazy river and one day I will die there
00:44:20 that's my destiny
00:44:22 I do like those but I never like water parks
00:44:24 purely because
00:44:26 I got to wear a swimsuit
00:44:28 and I can't wear a shirt and it's like
00:44:30 I'm embarrassed about my gross body
00:44:32 it's not cool enough
00:44:34 it's not cool enough to be seen
00:44:36 wear a surfershirt
00:44:38 what the fuck is that
00:44:40 we're an under armor compression shirt
00:44:42 to shape your muscles
00:44:44 people are going to know
00:44:46 he's trying to hide something
00:44:48 okay your problem is you give a shit
00:44:50 fuck him dude
00:44:52 you're there to check out 14 year old tits
00:44:54 you're not there to impress anybody
00:44:56 I'll go there today
00:44:58 I think if Ben Saint has the courage
00:45:00 to go outside we should all have the courage
00:45:02 to be naked in public
00:45:04 I agree
00:45:06 water parks are great
00:45:08 there's a water park that's near my house
00:45:10 that's local and there's this giant ride
00:45:12 I think it's called
00:45:14 literally the toilet
00:45:16 and what you do is you just walk up to
00:45:18 the top of this very huge
00:45:20 it's like a funnel
00:45:22 that is the rise
00:45:24 it's slanted
00:45:26 so what you do is you just get up to the top of this thing
00:45:28 and you get in this little
00:45:30 it's kind of like the lazy river
00:45:32 you sit your ass in
00:45:34 and then what happens is
00:45:36 I don't know if I can draw this diagram
00:45:38 but just imagine you get pushed
00:45:40 you get fucking shoved
00:45:42 you ride the
00:45:44 the water wave spiral
00:45:46 you do a spiral in the funnel
00:45:48 and it's straight down
00:45:50 it's sideways so you're going up
00:45:52 and you're defying gravity
00:45:54 going upside down on this fucking funnel
00:45:56 until you finally get spit out
00:45:58 and you get destroyed
00:46:00 just think about the bizarre engineering work
00:46:02 to make these like strange death machines
00:46:04 just to make ourselves
00:46:06 have fun for a little while
00:46:08 it's so cool, I love the idea of making
00:46:10 amusement park rides
00:46:12 it's so like retarded
00:46:14 but it's the coolest thing ever
00:46:16 I actually do have a favorite amusement park ride
00:46:18 which is
00:46:20 I don't remember what it's called
00:46:22 the tin turning wheel thing
00:46:24 it's one of those ones where you're in a giant coffee cup
00:46:26 and it spins and it sucks you into the wall
00:46:28 tea cups, tea cups, tea cups or whatever
00:46:30 it's like the silly silo
00:46:32 where it spins in a circle and you stick to the wall
00:46:34 and the floor drops
00:46:36 one of the theme parks I live near
00:46:38 they have one that's the one that goes
00:46:40 way up and it goes sideways and stuff
00:46:42 but that one's fine
00:46:44 but they have this other really old one
00:46:46 I wouldn't be surprised if it was gone
00:46:48 if I went there again
00:46:50 it feels very 70s, it's got like carpet and stuff
00:46:52 even though it's outside
00:46:54 and it's just so tucked
00:46:56 out of the way where people don't notice it
00:46:58 so it's very
00:47:00 unpopular which means there's almost
00:47:02 never a line I always get to go right in there
00:47:04 so because of that
00:47:06 experience and the aesthetic of it
00:47:08 that makes it my favorite ride because it
00:47:10 consistently doesn't have a line to wait through
00:47:12 yeah
00:47:14 yeah that's great
00:47:16 accessibility and like
00:47:18 isn't that a great experience to like find this great ride
00:47:20 that other people just don't know about
00:47:22 and you've got there's just there's something about this
00:47:24 that is so linked with like my
00:47:26 happiest childhood memories
00:47:28 everything having to do with amusement parks
00:47:30 it just makes me happy to think about
00:47:32 it's just such a joy
00:47:34 I love these, this is like the one thing
00:47:36 that I like about children
00:47:38 or that like things are made for children
00:47:40 other than their bodies
00:47:42 other than their sexy ass blooming bodies
00:47:44 fortunately they won't give me a call
00:47:46 every single one
00:47:48 all right, I'll send you a snap right after this podcast
00:47:50 Nate
00:47:52 sounds good
00:47:54 yeah fuck Disney World
00:47:56 I know what the best amusement park is
00:47:58 motherfucking thrillville baby
00:48:02 look at thrillville go
00:48:04 here comes ps2 zero
00:48:06 you can go
00:48:08 you can go flirt with a fucking 12 year old kid
00:48:10 it's fun, you don't get arrested for it
00:48:12 I do in real life all the time dude
00:48:14 well that's legal for you
00:48:16 some of us get arrested for that
00:48:18 thrillville you think a ride's dumb
00:48:20 you fucking get rid of that shit and build a new one
00:48:22 it's easy, it's fucking easy
00:48:24 you don't even want to finish the roller coaster
00:48:26 you just want to say let it crash
00:48:28 you can do that, it's easy, it's fun
00:48:30 does that hurt your morale for the workers
00:48:32 well it probably helps the work of morale
00:48:34 but it depresses total earnings
00:48:36 the janitors don't like it because they have a lot of blood and guts to clean up
00:48:38 but everybody else enjoys it
00:48:40 because the kids are dead
00:48:42 we should have a ride on thrillville
00:48:44 Billy Johnson
00:48:46 he's a 12 year old boy, I ride him a lot
00:48:48 Ayo
00:48:50 look at pedophiles go
00:48:52 here they come, jails hero
00:48:54 does anybody have similar stories to this
00:48:56 so I've had a couple of incidents that happened like this
00:48:58 but basically what I'm talking about is like
00:49:00 so there's this batman ride or it was like a night wing ride
00:49:02 it probably has changed since I was last there
00:49:04 at six flags so it's this thing where you
00:49:06 it's like a spinny circle that just
00:49:08 lifts in the air and then you kind of like fly
00:49:10 you lie down like on your stomach you get kind of
00:49:12 squished into this thing and you hold on to the bars
00:49:14 then it just like spins you like towards your face
00:49:16 like you're flying like Superman
00:49:18 so actually it should have been called the Superman ride
00:49:20 I don't know why it's called the batman ride but anyway
00:49:22 so like we get in there and like the ride
00:49:24 starts and we all like get into position
00:49:26 and then the ride like shuts down
00:49:28 like it gets stuck like that
00:49:30 so I was there
00:49:32 for probably like 45 minutes until like
00:49:34 they pride me out of there
00:49:36 and I have situations where I'm like at the top of a roller coaster
00:49:38 like about to go down
00:49:40 and then the ride like gets stuck
00:49:42 and then you're stuck there
00:49:44 it's broken though
00:49:46 that's never happened
00:49:48 I've been on ones that get stuck and then like
00:49:50 someone climbs up and fixes a thing but only for a few minutes
00:49:52 see it's at those kinds of moments
00:49:54 that you realize how stupid it is
00:49:56 to even be doing this in the first place
00:49:58 and how like an amusement park ride
00:50:00 is not what man was meant to do
00:50:02 with the physical form
00:50:04 I know one roller coaster that has like these
00:50:06 like stairs at like the top of the
00:50:08 initial peak the initial peak
00:50:10 that gets you going up there's these little like you know
00:50:12 steel steps but like you have to go up
00:50:14 you have to like like I actually saw it once
00:50:16 a maintenance worker has to get on the ride
00:50:18 then stop the roller coaster
00:50:20 before it goes down the peak and he steps off
00:50:22 and then he goes on those little steppy things
00:50:24 and I'm like whoa that's a cool
00:50:26 as perilous place to work to like do your job
00:50:28 I do have a similar
00:50:30 I do have a somewhat I have a very just just a frustrating
00:50:32 shitty gay experience which was
00:50:34 this one log flume that has like
00:50:36 the longest line in the fucking
00:50:38 world and it's a 45 second
00:50:40 ride like one second
00:50:42 of ride is one minute of line
00:50:44 and it closed
00:50:46 when we were like three people away from
00:50:48 getting on oh god damn it
00:50:50 I've had that happen to me too it's the worst
00:50:52 I was like why the fuck
00:50:54 don't they put a giant
00:50:56 stop sign on the
00:50:58 beginning of the line 45
00:51:00 minutes before closing
00:51:02 that is such logic
00:51:04 easy problem to solve you just stop people from getting
00:51:06 in line as opposed to stopping them when it's
00:51:08 time to shut it down it's so easy to do
00:51:10 but they just don't give a fuck
00:51:12 they don't give a fuck they're going to ruin
00:51:14 children's lives
00:51:16 my favorite ride
00:51:18 is probably
00:51:20 the simpsons ride for the incredible
00:51:22 atmospheric vibe that I get just
00:51:24 being in line
00:51:26 just like the aesthetics
00:51:28 match the gameplay wholeheartedly
00:51:30 just when you hear that
00:51:32 you'd hear that voice coming over the PA
00:51:34 Homer what are those monsters
00:51:36 doing over there I don't understand
00:51:38 no those are those are saying
00:51:40 fire is skeleton
00:51:42 that is not a good mo impression at all
00:51:44 it's not mo
00:51:46 so uh yeah
00:51:48 actually like the second part of the ride where it gets to like
00:51:50 so let's say some gangsta steps to
00:51:52 your fly girl you just did it
00:51:54 a Q
00:51:56 shotgun blast yeah okay there you go
00:51:58 the simpsons ride is legitimately fucking sick
00:52:00 it's sick as fuck it's fucking
00:52:02 lol it makes me laugh
00:52:04 so fucking hard
00:52:06 and uh
00:52:08 like I don't even like the ride
00:52:10 it's like the line of the ride
00:52:12 because we are in line to get to the ride
00:52:14 you have to wait like 45 minutes and then
00:52:16 you just like blast simpsons ebony
00:52:18 into your redna and then it's like
00:52:20 behind the scenes like lore
00:52:22 about how like that one fucking funny yellow guy
00:52:24 who wants to get
00:52:26 the simpsons
00:52:28 and then you can just see him do the funny fucking
00:52:30 scheme on the tv
00:52:32 that's actually great when they put effort into
00:52:34 like the setup leading to the ride itself
00:52:36 that's good like the uh
00:52:38 like the fucking uh
00:52:40 charlotte's own ride
00:52:42 lego land
00:52:44 foam bionicle sword
00:52:46 uh
00:52:48 i love that
00:52:50 i have that exact one
00:52:52 i love the bionicle fucking shit
00:52:54 it's the coolest
00:52:56 lego land is like the only place that
00:52:58 deserves to have a gift shop
00:53:00 hippo i'm assuming you
00:53:02 you didn't go to the one in california right
00:53:04 no no i feel like they're the same
00:53:06 everywhere i went to lego land
00:53:08 oh okay okay um they're probably the same
00:53:10 anywhere uh yeah um um oh my
00:53:12 did you get your driver's license at lego land
00:53:14 did you get your fucking cool ass little car
00:53:16 yeah dude what the fuck is that
00:53:18 it's stupid
00:53:20 dude they tell you don't bump people
00:53:22 but you totally do it
00:53:24 i actually
00:53:26 i actually remember a time when there was an old lady
00:53:28 just in there like what the fuck are you
00:53:30 doing i guess she's like looking over after a kid
00:53:32 who's also in there so i attacked her
00:53:34 i just rammed her
00:53:36 you see weak blood and you go for it
00:53:38 oh that's good
00:53:40 time is over grandma this is the
00:53:42 youth's ride now
00:53:44 i i yeah so that that was sick
00:53:46 um you went full uh clockwork
00:53:48 orange at that moment you just went full
00:53:50 monster mode yeah okay yeah uh
00:53:52 lego land is is is cool
00:53:54 because you know the rides are alright
00:53:56 but the the main thing is that every
00:53:58 everything is made of lego
00:54:00 yes the stalls
00:54:02 the signs the
00:54:04 no no like really like i don't believe you
00:54:06 they're made of lego's
00:54:08 because they're alright
00:54:10 there's like huge lego statues
00:54:12 that are made by having like
00:54:14 like a metal frame
00:54:16 i've seen it not being done at the
00:54:18 place but i know how they do it they get
00:54:20 lego and they super glue it together so
00:54:22 it's just perfectly forever going to be
00:54:24 it's like literally a statue and they do it
00:54:26 for fucking everything
00:54:28 in the place like even the plants
00:54:30 some of the plants are made of lego it's like
00:54:32 yeah i i i feel
00:54:34 i feel like playing minecraft right now i love
00:54:36 it you're telling me on lego land
00:54:38 did you have did you have like the dinosaur
00:54:40 fossil ride
00:54:42 oh i i mean
00:54:44 i the the version of lego land
00:54:46 i went to maybe different from yours because
00:54:48 of our age difference
00:54:50 i don't know i haven't been in a long time
00:54:52 but oh well yeah yeah
00:54:54 like there's one uh for me
00:54:56 where it's like uh like like like while you were
00:54:58 online you could like you could like there's like a
00:55:00 sand pit and you could like get like a cool
00:55:02 thing like a pickaxe you could like get like
00:55:04 fossil like lego fossils in the sand
00:55:06 while you fucking while you were
00:55:08 in line holy shit
00:55:10 yes level that sounds great
00:55:12 and and and then when you get up you gotta
00:55:14 climb some like stairs and then like the guy
00:55:16 working it for me was always like it's fucking
00:55:18 me it's a fucking lego land
00:55:20 pays me $100 on the coolest
00:55:22 big dick motherfucker you'll ever see
00:55:24 i was like can can you
00:55:26 say the funny stuff was mine
00:55:28 he's like here's the funny stuff
00:55:30 was like oh my god
00:55:32 thank you and then they
00:55:34 pushed me and he fucking got me on that shit
00:55:36 and i ran and i saw a dinosaur
00:55:38 they were made out of lego
00:55:40 they're all made out of lego
00:55:42 i think there was a dinosaur land
00:55:44 area it's it's just it's
00:55:46 it was just marvelous to just think like
00:55:48 i have lego's at home i can make
00:55:50 a thing about as big as a football if i
00:55:52 really tried but these
00:55:54 these guys have so much lego
00:55:56 bricks that i'm very jealous of the amount
00:55:58 that they can use to build a literal
00:56:00 side life size dinosaur to block
00:56:02 my path and kill me in my sleep
00:56:04 i love it dude that one green dragon ride
00:56:06 you were talking about it was my favorite fucking thing
00:56:08 that was the first time i ever did an accidental

00:56:38 what i always liked like as i got older
00:56:40 like we i went a couple times
00:56:42 like a number of times and as i got older
00:56:44 i see i appreciated more and more
00:56:46 the miniature village
00:56:48 made out of lego which is like
00:56:50 the huge like big like a
00:56:52 million things like tiny little little lego
00:56:54 people and lego cars some of which
00:56:56 i'm gonna come
00:56:58 and and and i think
00:57:00 i remember in windsor they did have
00:57:02 like a lego big ben you know like like
00:57:04 landmarks like like really
00:57:06 impressive huge things i'm like

00:57:14 it's the coolest fucking shit i've ever seen
00:57:16 dude the the land of fucking
00:57:18 like like mini land was so fucking cool first
00:57:20 okay okay but also okay you know okay i don't
00:57:22 think you're gonna have this because it's like it i remember this being like a new
00:57:24 thing that like while i was going to lego and this was like a new
00:57:26 thing that like they just came out with
00:57:28 there like the ceo's like like like john lego
00:57:30 was in his fucking ceo born
00:57:32 and it was like you know what would make
00:57:34 lego land even better if it was
00:57:36 a water park too
00:57:38 and so
00:57:40 the water is made of lego
00:57:44 so my god they opened up like a new
00:57:46 area it was like pirate themed it could
00:57:48 go in and there was there was a there was like a lazy
00:57:50 lazy river and like and like the fucking like
00:57:52 things like you eat like okay the like
00:57:54 the tube you get in there was like it was like
00:57:56 just normal rubber but then there was like parts
00:57:58 of the thing that you could stick your own lego's
00:58:00 onto and just like build while you're inside
00:58:02 of the lazy river
00:58:04 and then and then there was this ride where you
00:58:06 could like get on a fucking cool ass fucking slide and there's one where you
00:58:08 can like ride a pirate ship and shoot fucking water
00:58:10 people okay oh I have that
00:58:12 I remember that bit so it's like this okay
00:58:14 okay there's there's like a little like pool
00:58:16 area where people just are like on you know
00:58:18 pirate ships and they can just you know shoot other people
00:58:20 but then also but also it's like right now there's
00:58:22 like a sidewalk there's like a there's
00:58:24 like a pathway that's like right up next to the pool
00:58:26 and there's like guns on the sidewalk so if you're
00:58:28 just like a walking by you're not even on the ride
00:58:30 you can shoot the people on the ride just like a
00:58:32 second or two and just fucking ruin them you can
00:58:34 just rape them you can just fucking kill them
00:58:36 and it's fucking sick and I love the

00:58:48 I fucking got you I memed you all
00:58:50 so hard okay all right go ahead
00:58:52 I have I have one more thing to say and
00:58:54 then I'm done saying things
00:58:56 I remembered during the course of this that there
00:58:58 was a very more more of a quaint
00:59:00 theme park on the isle
00:59:02 of white which is like an island
00:59:04 just to the south of here just just for
00:59:06 no black people right I understand okay yeah
00:59:08 well white with a whatever
00:59:10 bitch
00:59:12 it's a tiny little island and it has
00:59:14 this tiny theme park which is based
00:59:16 on what the isle of white
00:59:18 is known for is like known for smuggling
00:59:20 because it's like a good place for pirates to smuggle
00:59:22 shit and it's called black gang shine
00:59:24 if anybody in the audience has been to
00:59:26 black gang shine
00:59:28 it's
00:59:30 so fucking cool it's
00:59:32 it's a place my dad used to go
00:59:34 for every holiday he and
00:59:36 his family would go to black gang shine and he brought
00:59:38 me and my brothers to there
00:59:40 and now there's like a like a it's like a
00:59:42 our family heirloom is that theme park is great
00:59:44 and
00:59:46 if I get an image
00:59:48 there's a giant shine you said
00:59:50 yeah shine like
00:59:52 c-h-i-n-e

01:00:00 it's a giant pirate
01:00:02 smuggler a statue at the entrance
01:00:04 and it's not like the biggest
01:00:06 that's awesome
01:00:08 I just have a lot of fun memories
01:00:10 of it there's like this western
01:00:12 town area
01:00:14 and a dinosaur place
01:00:16 it's not like the greatest place ever
01:00:18 the smugglers are well known for smuggling
01:00:20 dinosaurs in and out of this island
01:00:22 oh and there was this one thing
01:00:24 oh it's so scary
01:00:26 it was like a trick mirror thing
01:00:28 it's a little castle area
01:00:30 and you go in there and there's this
01:00:32 this beautiful lady behind the glass
01:00:34 and she's like you listen to the audio playing
01:00:36 it's like I'm a lady I'm normal
01:00:38 I'm not evil and then
01:00:40 after like five minutes of speaking
01:00:42 there's suddenly a scary music plays
01:00:44 boom and then there's like
01:00:46 a mirror trickery thing where
01:00:48 she physically looks like
01:00:50 she turns into a monster
01:00:52 but it's like because she's reflected from a mirror
01:00:54 and you can't see the mirror as you're looking through the window
01:00:56 so I thought like she's literally
01:00:58 like an actual demon suddenly
01:01:00 and I jumped and I pissed my pants and I ran away
01:01:02 but I love that so much
01:01:04 I hope it's still there I want to go back there
01:01:06 when I have kids and show them
01:01:08 and force them to piss their pants and die
01:01:10 yeah I love
01:01:12 that place so much if anybody knows that place
01:01:14 that's great that's the coolest
01:01:16 fuck yeah I have a few more
01:01:18 points here as well I mean I could go out about theme parks all day
01:01:20 I have tons of memories from them
01:01:22 because you know the most important thing I just want to comment on
01:01:24 like the restaurants in theme parks are like
01:01:26 usually shit but like
01:01:28 one of the best restaurants I've ever been to
01:01:30 and people will test this because it's super fucking expensive
01:01:32 is the blue bayou at Disneyland
01:01:34 do they have the equivalent of
01:01:36 the blue bayou at Disney World
01:01:38 do you know what that is
01:01:40 it doesn't ring a bell I'm not sure
01:01:42 you all know the price of the Caribbean ride right
01:01:44 of course of course
01:01:46 you are on a boat
01:01:48 and there's like a slow river
01:01:50 there's a little bit of dips and ups
01:01:52 kind of like an atmospheric
01:01:54 New Orleans sort of like a swamp setting
01:01:56 but inside of this
01:01:58 imagine the ride as a
01:02:00 circle that's like pretty big
01:02:02 in the middle
01:02:04 behind the trees of the ride behind like the props
01:02:06 of the ride there is a fucking
01:02:08 super ass
01:02:10 smug ass like anime expert
01:02:12 rooftop soiree
01:02:14 fucking like fancy
01:02:16 Louisiana fancy restaurant
01:02:18 inside of the ride
01:02:20 and you can see all the cool fucking like
01:02:22 pirates and all like the cool like like
01:02:24 ride people taking the ride while you're eating these
01:02:26 fucking like million dollar steaks
01:02:28 and like all like Obama
01:02:30 was there I think it's fucking crazy
01:02:32 it's so fucking cool
01:02:34 it's in the middle of a ride what
01:02:36 what other place what other place what other
01:02:38 restaurant is good and inside
01:02:40 of a ride perfect
01:02:42 props for that that's pretty amazing
01:02:44 it's fucking sick I love it
01:02:46 world building
01:02:48 exactly I should mention that I'm going to Disneyland
01:02:50 on the 23rd
01:02:52 oh my god
01:02:54 for my birthday
01:02:56 party
01:02:58 if you want to meet up with munchie too bad
01:03:00 because this came out the day after
01:03:02 get a look at
01:03:04 donky go
01:03:10 you said it might do
01:03:12 one last thing
01:03:14 while it's not
01:03:16 exactly an amusement park I went to the
01:03:18 Nickelodeon hotel in Florida
01:03:20 when I was a wee baby
01:03:22 hey I did that too
01:03:24 that's where we stayed during our thing
01:03:26 I think
01:03:28 it might be confusing things up whatever
01:03:30 let's make the pcp hq
01:03:32 at the Nickelodeon hotel please
01:03:34 that's a good idea
01:03:36 assigned sealed and the check is in the mail
01:03:38 from Obama to us
01:03:40 for endorsement hotel change
01:03:42 so yeah so I went there
01:03:44 his full name is
01:03:46 Obama Hussein slime
01:03:48 Obama
01:03:50 Nickelodeon slime guy
01:03:52 excellent
01:03:54 the reason he's so into slime is because black people are so intrusive
01:03:56 in slimy
01:03:58 he just takes some slime off from their body
01:04:00 just carves them off and puts on
01:04:02 his meals
01:04:04 anyway so while I was at the Nickelodeon hotel
01:04:06 there was this big sort of
01:04:08 mini water park
01:04:10 slide apparatus where you could get
01:04:12 water
01:04:14 the important thing is it was Miami
01:04:16 or around there at least
01:04:18 there was about to be a thunder storm
01:04:20 and also probably hurricane
01:04:22 that was like about to destroy
01:04:24 you should go inside
01:04:26 probably and not be where the lightning is
01:04:28 that was the first time I ever played Battlefront 2
01:04:30 that was also the first trip where I
01:04:32 like while in Florida it's slightly off topic
01:04:34 but I saw an alligator for the first time
01:04:36 I was like this is my favorite thing ever
01:04:38 I also got really sick because I touched one
01:04:40 what if an alligator was also
01:04:42 investigating something
01:04:44 hello look at don't go
01:04:46 here he comes but never have a
01:04:48 kind of on this hero
01:04:50 hey don't go
01:04:52 let's go let's go
01:04:54 do we have a
01:04:56 which prostitute would you rather
01:04:58 fuck at the Nickelodeon hotel
01:05:00 as told by ginger
01:05:02 or Jenny the robot
01:05:04 from my life as a teen robot
01:05:06 Jenny the robot obviously
01:05:08 her it amuses me
01:05:10 how much her popularity has exploded
01:05:12 via porn after the show ended
01:05:14 dill pickles yeah
01:05:16 I would fuck the main stormtrooper
01:05:18 I don't think dill pickles is a fucking prostitute
01:05:20 neither is Jenny
01:05:22 she's a classy young lady goddammit
01:05:24 he's a one year old baby
01:05:26 not an all grown up
01:05:28 he's available
01:05:30 in all grown up he's an obnoxious 10 year old piece of shit
01:05:32 oh dude
01:05:34 he's not one he's just 10
01:05:36 he's just 5
01:05:38 I mean that's better right
01:05:40 I would rather fuck a 10 year old
01:05:42 than a one year old baby
01:05:44 serious question would it be better to fuck
01:05:46 a one year old or a 10 year old for their sake
01:05:48 cause if they're one they might not remember getting fucked
01:05:50 but if they're 10 you could fuck them up a lot
01:05:52 you can't fit your dick in a baby
01:05:54 I can find a way
01:05:56 I mean not me ask her a friend here
01:05:58 oh no
01:06:00 no no
01:06:02 there goes her amortization
01:06:04 there goes my hero
01:06:10 there goes my hero
01:06:12 look at donkey go
01:06:16 that's the rule of threes baby
01:06:18 there it is
01:06:20 wait wait let me test it
01:06:22 let's see if it's 20 the fourth time
01:06:24 look at donkey go
01:06:26 no nobody left
01:06:28 oh shit boy
01:06:30 before the recording started you were talking about
01:06:32 the idea of having a sound board for the PCP
01:06:34 that you're in control of
01:06:36 I would absolutely love a there goes our
01:06:38 amortization sound
01:06:40 that is a great idea
01:06:42 oh that's unfortunate
01:06:44 do you have anything to say about fair
01:06:46 since they're kind of related
01:06:48 no I want to go to quest
01:06:50 I talked about that renaissance fair for a bit
01:06:52 we could stretch that out to a whole other PCP
01:06:54 yeah
01:06:56 press one if you want to hear an old PCP about fairs
01:06:58 first carnivals and festivals
01:07:00 all the places were clowns
01:07:02 and they're a congregate
01:07:04 I just need episode of only me
01:07:08 I'll invite my special guest the japanese juggalope
01:07:10 he's the underteller who was on this one
01:07:12 that's an excellent idea
01:07:14 here we go to questions everybody
01:07:16 here's one from twitter
01:07:18 you guys literally just didn't even get to me
01:07:20 I had a lot to say
01:07:22 fuck me I guess
01:07:24 why don't you interrupt sooner or something
01:07:26 I guess
01:07:28 I mean
01:07:30 really it's more like
01:07:32 I thought that this podcast was going to go in a totally different direction
01:07:34 I thought we were going to be talking more about
01:07:36 the need more analysis
01:07:38 since it ended up just being a bunch of memories
01:07:40 so I guess
01:07:42 yeah I have a lot to say about
01:07:44 it's not a fucking anime for children you can't analyze
01:07:46 it
01:07:48 is a
01:07:50 designer of roller coasters
01:07:52 you know exactly
01:07:54 I'm coming on forever
01:07:56 roller coasters forever
01:07:58 I can go as long as we want
01:08:00 so fucking
01:08:02 if I was at a theme park
01:08:04 the board meeting
01:08:06 when they talk about how they're going to invent theme parks
01:08:08 it's the origin of theme parks
01:08:10 board meeting sounds like a cool fun meeting
01:08:12 if you ask me
01:08:14 I would have put down my papers
01:08:16 don't go
01:08:18 I'm sorry
01:08:20 I would have put down my papers and adjusted my bifocals
01:08:22 and looked at the guy
01:08:24 in the middle of the pitch for theme parks
01:08:26 well if people are going to be standing around
01:08:28 for like three hours a day
01:08:30 in lines and this idea is not going to work
01:08:32 come up with something else you know
01:08:34 because that's what I always feel like when I'm in a line
01:08:36 at the theme park where I'm like this whole idea
01:08:38 like as much fun as I've had at theme parks
01:08:40 I feel like my experience with them has been
01:08:42 weirdly mixed and that like
01:08:44 I just feel like the whole idea
01:08:46 like just doesn't really work yet
01:08:48 we really need to live in like a post-singularity
01:08:50 post-scarcity society
01:08:52 before theme parks can really work
01:08:54 what are you talking about
01:08:56 they're economically viable right now right
01:08:58 I assume they would be
01:09:00 go on to questions this is a different topic
01:09:02 no no no
01:09:04 you can't get away that easy
01:09:06 like lines are long
01:09:08 but what are you
01:09:10 what are you going to do about it huh
01:09:12 what is your actual like
01:09:14 you buy a fast pass for 100 bucks
01:09:16 just go in the exit and get right in the right
01:09:18 or if you're with a disabled person
01:09:20 you can go right to the front
01:09:22 dude I abused so many
01:09:24 disabilities while I was at Disneyland
01:09:26 I abused so many
01:09:28 my fucking my crack smoking
01:09:30 uncle is like dude
01:09:32 like one time I was shot in the arm and I don't have an arm anymore
01:09:34 so like give me some tickets bro
01:09:36 and they're like okay and then I fucking
01:09:38 I stole them from him
01:09:40 and I did all the rides very fast
01:09:42 oh there you go
01:09:44 I'm like paying it forward
01:09:46 cause I've only been to like two theme parks really
01:09:48 really two that are near me
01:09:50 and my parents are like why go to other ones
01:09:52 so I've been to those two so many times
01:09:54 that I feel like I've sort of like
01:09:56 I'm sort of like the illusion sort of breaks
01:09:58 right so I get more of a cynical view
01:10:00 I really want to go to other theme parks once in a while
01:10:02 and like do that
01:10:04 yeah yeah but like there's this one called worlds of fun
01:10:06 which is like
01:10:08 themed after the world
01:10:10 so it's like different areas of different countries
01:10:12 more like board meeting
01:10:14 is it like Epoch kind of
01:10:16 it's like it was a China area
01:10:18 a fucking America area
01:10:20 and it's the most boring bog standard theming ever
01:10:22 and you don't even notice it cause it's not even thick enough
01:10:24 it's like it's such a subtle theme
01:10:26 you don't notice it and it's boring and stupid
01:10:28 and like and like my
01:10:30 my parents which is mostly
01:10:32 most of the time I've gone to theme parks with my parents
01:10:34 they're just really bad at having fun
01:10:36 they like they don't understand how to have fun
01:10:38 like they don't like to um
01:10:40 they don't like to fork over the excess of money for food
01:10:42 so they always like pack lunches and like
01:10:44 so not fun god damn it
01:10:46 I came here to waste money god damn
01:10:48 yeah exactly
01:10:50 they always like walk back to the car
01:10:52 cause they don't want to take it to the park
01:10:54 yeah and I'm like why
01:10:56 this is so fucking stupid
01:10:58 I don't want to waste money
01:11:00 I would rather have like a yummy turkey sandwich that my mom made
01:11:02 than an 8 dollars and 50 cents fucking hot dog
01:11:04 well it depends
01:11:06 I think with that it's like uh
01:11:08 sandwiches and stuff it's always like
01:11:10 kinda gooey and gross cause it's been in a hot car
01:11:12 it's not the same
01:11:14 my dad always put a cooler and I got cool packs in it
01:11:16 and shit you know so
01:11:18 my parents did that too
01:11:20 it's like all the inconvenience of camping
01:11:22 being like crowbarred into
01:11:24 an already expensive experience
01:11:26 of going to a theme park
01:11:28 but yeah that's really the big issue for me
01:11:30 I never want to feel like I have enough money to spend
01:11:32 and it always feels like
01:11:34 it's just constantly fighting me to spend more money
01:11:36 so that in combination with lines
01:11:38 in combination with going to the same two theme parks forever
01:11:40 like the other theme park we have
01:11:42 which is like 4 hours away
01:11:44 is called Silver Dollar City
01:11:46 which actually has
01:11:48 a theme right it has like an aesthetic
01:11:50 which is like
01:11:52 old timey america right so like 1800s
01:11:54 because
01:11:56 it was all based around a cave
01:11:58 cause Missouri has a lot of caves apparently
01:12:00 so these people
01:12:02 like owned the cave back in the 50s
01:12:04 and they started showing the cave off
01:12:06 and selling tickets to it
01:12:08 so eventually they started like having
01:12:10 attractions on the line
01:12:12 leading up to the cave
01:12:14 and people ended up just watching the attractions
01:12:16 so then they started building restaurants
01:12:18 and then they started building rides
01:12:20 and so eventually it became a theme park
01:12:22 all around a cave right
01:12:24 but it all was extrapolated
01:12:26 off of the aesthetic of
01:12:28 you know the
01:12:30 the homesteading americans
01:12:32 who found the cave right
01:12:34 and also the indians who also found the cave
01:12:36 according to the guy guiding us through the cave
01:12:38 like how the who the fuck
01:12:40 reported on that story I don't know
01:12:42 also when we descend into the cave
01:12:44 on their man-made staircase they play the theme
01:12:46 of the empire from Star Wars
01:12:48 the dum-bum-ba-dum-bum-ba-dum-bum-ba-dum
01:12:50 I'm like whoa
01:12:52 but yeah it's a really cool theme park
01:12:54 why that specifically
01:12:56 I know right well it's cool cause you're going into
01:12:58 this big cave you know
01:13:00 but like it's a cool theme park
01:13:02 because it has all one
01:13:04 tone one setting
01:13:06 and it's very consistent
01:13:08 you know everything feels like old timey america
01:13:10 the rides are like
01:13:12 the fire in the hole
01:13:14 which is like an indoor roller coaster
01:13:16 all about fighting fires before we had hoses and shit
01:13:18 so it's really terrifying you know
01:13:20 and like they've got like
01:13:22 what's it like
01:13:24 like a TNT themed roller coaster
01:13:26 and so much shit like that
01:13:28 and you know it's also christian too
01:13:30 I think like christians own it
01:13:32 so sometimes there can be like
01:13:34 there can be like some christian
01:13:36 like there can be like some country singers
01:13:38 at one of the little theater places
01:13:40 the most country thing possible
01:13:42 yeah yeah and like they can like incorporate god stuff
01:13:44 and it doesn't break immersion
01:13:46 because it's old timey america right
01:13:48 so it like works right
01:13:50 I don't know where I was going with this
01:13:52 but like oh yeah they even have a
01:13:54 they have like a haunted house but it's themed after
01:13:56 you know like an old timey mansion
01:13:58 and it's really cool with like a
01:14:00 five degrees tilted and it's the coolest
01:14:02 possible experience of life
01:14:04 is it built on an ancient
01:14:06 in a native american burial ground
01:14:08 oh it should be man they should like expand
01:14:10 like find an age of american burial ground
01:14:12 go there and build it
01:14:14 and let all the engine spirits out
01:14:16 okay you're right sorry I like theme parks
01:14:18 I just I just it's just like
01:14:20 the last couple times we went to one
01:14:22 it was just we weren't in the mood to do a vacation
01:14:24 you know like it's just it's hard to get me in the mood
01:14:26 to vacation you know it's just like
01:14:28 theme parks are hard
01:14:30 with like a family of
01:14:32 various different ages particularly when
01:14:34 my sister was very small because it's like
01:14:36 she couldn't go on any rides and my parents
01:14:38 were too old to care to go on rides
01:14:40 and it was like this sucks right I need to go
01:14:42 with just my friends and my girlfriend which I could
01:14:44 probably afford to do now
01:14:46 I've never been to a theme park by myself
01:14:48 but I feel like I would enjoy it
01:14:50 a lot because of the
01:14:52 because of the freedom to just
01:14:54 not do anything if I don't feel like it
01:14:56 every time you're with a person you're like
01:14:58 are you having fun do you want to do this
01:15:00 I guess we'll do this what about you
01:15:02 huh
01:15:04 who's hungry let's go get food oh I don't
01:15:06 I'm not hungry well I mean
01:15:08 you're a kid so you got to come
01:15:10 with us well you know
01:15:12 I do like going if you can go with like someone that you
01:15:14 you know just like a good friend who
01:15:16 vibes with you well one person or two people
01:15:18 like if I were with any of you guys I'm sure we would
01:15:20 have a good time because we don't give a fuck about what the other
01:15:22 person thinks you can just tell me if you're having a
01:15:24 problem or something and then you know we'll
01:15:26 immediately fix it as opposed to like a friend
01:15:28 you don't know as well who just acts cagey and won't
01:15:30 be upfront about what they want to do or whatever
01:15:32 you know that's bullshit I treat amusement parks a lot
01:15:34 like conventions as I described
01:15:36 in the convention pockets where it's just
01:15:38 very this is they're much better than convention in
01:15:40 the way it's just a cool way to hang out with your
01:15:42 friends and if you invite your buddy it's a cool
01:15:44 time and just to do things
01:15:46 that you might die on and it makes you feel
01:15:48 like more like brothers
01:15:50 also DeVoo once
01:15:52 the PCPHQ happens I will take you
01:15:54 specifically to an amusement park and we will go
01:15:56 together yeah I realize
01:15:58 like yeah going with the PCP would be great because
01:16:00 you guys because even my offline
01:16:02 friends who I've had throughout my life and gone to theme parks
01:16:04 with aren't good at having fun either
01:16:06 and my favorite thing about
01:16:08 being in the PCP is you like
01:16:10 there's enough people who are good at having fun I could
01:16:12 just coast on it and have a great
01:16:14 time so we yeah I'd love to
01:16:16 do
01:16:18 Red Con 3 should just be at a theme park
01:16:20 hey
01:16:22 by the way I just want to say you mentioned
01:16:24 Christian themes and I just wanted to mention
01:16:26 one of the most one of the most thrilling
01:16:28 experiences I had at one
01:16:30 of these
01:16:32 amusement type place was at the
01:16:34 creationist museum where
01:16:36 they there's a so there's like
01:16:38 an Ark ride where you can just go walk on a life
01:16:40 size recreation of Noah's Ark
01:16:42 that's what he actually wrote on I
01:16:44 didn't do that but they did give
01:16:46 us the real scoop there was a whole you know
01:16:48 walk-through place where they did educate us on what
01:16:50 really went down so just so everybody knows
01:16:52 dinosaurs were on the Ark
01:16:54 they were there they just died off
01:16:56 unrelatedly afterward that's just
01:16:58 this is so you know that's how it went down
01:17:00 I didn't worry about that because I want to know if the Legoland
01:17:02 ride looked at any part about Jesus
01:17:04 or Noah's Ark
01:17:06 Oh Nate, at Creation Museum
01:17:08 did they have like a live reenactment
01:17:10 of a monkey not turning into a human
01:17:14 Racism
01:17:16 How dare you
01:17:18 By the way, it's just
01:17:20 that you cite a museum as a theme park because I would also do
01:17:22 that for there there's a there's
01:17:24 like a like there is an actual
01:17:26 real there's an actual real like
01:17:28 United States Navy like
01:17:30 battleship turn museum because it's so fucking
01:17:32 old called United States midway
01:17:34 and it's
01:17:36 docked here permanently in San Diego it's like a museum now
01:17:38 and you walk and you can walk out through all the
01:17:40 corridors of the ship and
01:17:42 there's like there is this one
01:17:44 you can get like snacks and stuff too and there's just one like
01:17:46 ride I would call it where it's like
01:17:48 you get in this sort of like
01:17:50 fucking cannon
01:17:52 they like
01:17:54 stuff you into like this like little like almost
01:17:56 like bus sized like virtual
01:17:58 reality like shuttle and it's just
01:18:00 like let's pretend
01:18:02 what would happen if you guys were on World War
01:18:04 2 what would happen then let's make
01:18:06 like this movie about like like
01:18:08 it's like a virtual reality ride where
01:18:10 the bus like turns and like
01:18:12 twist
01:18:14 like like for the twist and turns you make
01:18:16 within like the video if you get what I'm saying
01:18:18 like it doesn't actually go anywhere it just like
01:18:20 assimilates what it would be like if you were
01:18:22 making those turns and that was fucking cool
01:18:24 I got to see a lot of people die
01:18:26 I got to see a lot of Japanese people
01:18:28 get kicked the fucking bucket and it was great
01:18:30 hell yeah when I when I was a wee lad
01:18:32 in the Boy Scouts me and my mom
01:18:34 we spent
01:18:36 a weekend on the like on a
01:18:38 battleship just like staying there for like a weekend
01:18:40 of fun and adventure and stuff
01:18:42 and it was like one of the most fun weekends of my entire life
01:18:44 but so that aside
01:18:46 I did want to say another thing that
01:18:48 D'Vu mentioned to me was he mentioned
01:18:50 a specific line and it was
01:18:52 attractions while you're in line and that just got
01:18:54 me thinking about wouldn't it be great
01:18:56 if if prostitution
01:18:58 was legal and they just had actual whores
01:19:00 okay just just follow me here for a second
01:19:02 okay like imagine you're in the world right
01:19:04 you're at Disney World and you're in line
01:19:06 prostitute and they got they got Disney
01:19:08 princesses just just they're whores
01:19:10 and they will fuck you and like you can fuck
01:19:12 Rapunzel who I want to remind everyone is
01:19:14 canonically 18 so even though she looks like
01:19:16 she's 14 she is in fact 18 so
01:19:18 I would just just wouldn't that be a great
01:19:20 attraction huh when you're in line would that be great
01:19:22 everybody right
01:19:24 my final feeling on theme parks right
01:19:26 I mean by the way yes
01:19:28 I hope you're bouncing off my idea
01:19:30 but go on
01:19:32 well I mean it's part of it which is that I want
01:19:34 theme parks to just be several orders
01:19:36 of magnitude like more
01:19:38 extravagant than they are again post
01:19:40 yes exactly post scarcity
01:19:42 economy is like because I
01:19:44 because I know like Walt Disney had way more
01:19:46 fucking like ambitions to food is
01:19:48 weird utilitarianism here we go
01:19:50 this isn't
01:19:52 about getting there it's about how cool
01:19:54 it would be when we are there and it's
01:19:56 about cool shit not like resources
01:19:58 not like fucking mining oil
01:20:00 from Titan it's about having theme parks
01:20:02 right uh-huh
01:20:04 cool tycoons
01:20:06 yeah but like yeah you know
01:20:08 like Disney himself had
01:20:10 so many more ambitions as to what he
01:20:12 wanted like Disney world and apcot
01:20:14 to be he wanted them to be like actual
01:20:16 shit because people keep conceptualizing
01:20:18 like like like cities
01:20:20 that are just like these little tiny areas
01:20:22 where you walk around and you could just do
01:20:24 everything that humans want to do and it's really
01:20:26 tight concise video gamey way
01:20:28 that's what theme parks are ultimately trying to do is make
01:20:30 video games IRL that's right you know that's right
01:20:32 and we just they just need to you know what I really want
01:20:34 I want a theme park that is like
01:20:36 a giant
01:20:38 thrift store slash antique shop
01:20:40 right because my favorite thing about those
01:20:42 like tap those little stores
01:20:44 is that they are often built out of like buildings
01:20:46 that are not meant to be stores and they have all these
01:20:48 weird rooms that like no one
01:20:50 is in and I love that
01:20:52 and I just want to have like a giant mansion
01:20:54 that has rides in it
01:20:56 like that one weird mansion that's like in California
01:20:58 or whatever built by a crazy woman
01:21:00 or whatever over the course of 30 years and you could
01:21:02 explore this mansion and go around in all these weird
01:21:04 rooms because we're talking about
01:21:06 yeah if I'm ever in California for long enough in the
01:21:08 right part of California because I know it's like the size
01:21:10 of a fucking European nation
01:21:12 California I would love to visit that place
01:21:14 because like the thing about the
01:21:16 dude hit me up and we'll go dude yeah
01:21:18 because like
01:21:20 theme parks are cool because you conceptualize
01:21:22 yourself going on this adventure
01:21:24 but when you go there it's like everyone's there it's like
01:21:26 being in a fucking auditorium
01:21:28 and I love I'd love to have
01:21:30 an incredibly huge mansion
01:21:32 with so many rooms that some of which
01:21:34 some people don't even know about and you just
01:21:36 walk around I would absolutely
01:21:38 I would pay $500 a year
01:21:40 for a season pass to a mansion
01:21:42 it's so huge that you could find your own hallways
01:21:44 and like no one will ever be there and you could
01:21:46 like jack off
01:21:48 did I mention that I worked at
01:21:50 in Newport Rhode Island doing like
01:21:52 tours of like the great
01:21:54 Newport mansions that are like gigantic
01:21:56 yeah they're like they're like actual palaces just
01:21:58 based on capitalism not aristocracy
01:22:00 it's pretty great pretty much
01:22:02 pretty much incredible incredible
01:22:04 so by the way they were
01:22:06 simply divine and shout out by the way
01:22:08 to the great American mall in
01:22:10 Minneapolis Minnesota that I visited
01:22:12 some time earlier was that this year
01:22:14 I can't remember but
01:22:16 that was just a big old it's a big old amusement
01:22:18 park inside a mall in like the center
01:22:20 of the mall yeah what did I say
01:22:22 great American mall whatever it's one of those
01:22:24 things I thought it was that
01:22:26 by the way I should have mentioned this earlier
01:22:28 by the way Nate you said you played the clarinet
01:22:30 and you got to go to Disneyland for like being
01:22:32 in a big world oh my god it was the
01:22:34 bopper bowl episode of fucking Spongebob
01:22:36 oh my god
01:22:38 anyway the reason I say
01:22:40 that Nate is because I also
01:22:42 played the clarinet in band and I got to
01:22:44 go to Disneyland for being in band
01:22:46 so I live the exact
01:22:48 same life that you did
01:22:50 which is weird the munchie is a Spongebob
01:22:52 is a Squidward so you wouldn't think they would
01:22:54 play clarinet
01:22:56 I like to be thinking of myself as a Mr. Krabs
01:22:58 racist and capitalist trippin
01:23:00 just looking to
01:23:02 how's Mr. Krabs a racist
01:23:04 when he has a mixed race daughter
01:23:06 uh
01:23:08 well he's not racist against that race
01:23:10 just a very particular one
01:23:12 he fucked the whale as a meme
01:23:14 it was a meme so
01:23:16 I think he all fucked the whale in college
01:23:18 he's ironically raising
01:23:20 his daughter yeah listen I'm not here
01:23:22 I'm not here to profile someone but can't you just
01:23:24 imagine Mr. Krabs in a
01:23:26 MAGA hat can't you just imagine him
01:23:28 can't you just see him
01:23:30 it would be a part of the show
01:23:32 that's true we got a question on twitter
01:23:34 from
01:23:36 that's your cue Nate
01:23:38 oh that's a cue I thought you were actually reading it
01:23:40 okay alright here we go everybody
01:23:42 question what's the one I was going to read before
01:23:44 where did that go oh here we go
01:23:46 okay this is from at lord light skin
01:23:48 lord light skin everybody
01:23:50 that's a good kind of skin to have
01:23:52 that's what they say
01:23:54 so tbcrasnators how would
01:23:56 you want the world to end
01:23:58 how would you want the world to end
01:24:00 there's a lot of possibilities that are
01:24:02 quite alluring I'd like
01:24:04 I'd like water to come up
01:24:06 and then everyone to be in boats and then everyone to
01:24:08 become pirates hell yeah
01:24:10 so that's kind of
01:24:12 like a positive like the world just changes
01:24:14 kind of world ending because I was thinking like the world
01:24:16 literally explodes yeah yeah
01:24:18 meteor but I like yours better I like that
01:24:20 well yeah
01:24:22 people still live whatever it is I want
01:24:24 it to be trumps fault because that'd be like the funniest
01:24:26 scenario possible dude that would be so funny
01:24:28 would the liberals be
01:24:30 super smug about that though and they'd be
01:24:32 yeah no they'd be funny
01:24:34 but they'd be smug and I hate smug liberals
01:24:36 they like the most annoying people in the world well yeah
01:24:38 but I have a funny hat so I win
01:24:40 fuck yeah dude
01:24:42 I think I gotta go with meteor to the planet
01:24:44 maybe I'm just thinking too much of Final Fantasy 7
01:24:46 but like I've always I've just got such a
01:24:48 it would look so cool if I could see it
01:24:50 if I could see that happening oh that's just for that
01:24:52 reason alone you know just the whole
01:24:54 maybe I'm thinking too much of Final Fantasy 7
01:24:56 is the quote of your life
01:24:58 is it not
01:25:00 you're right dude you are damn right
01:25:02 I would like to think it too much of Homestuck
01:25:04 when you said that yep oh jeez
01:25:06 that there wasn't even a dramatic
01:25:08 planet explosion in fucking Homestuck
01:25:10 we're like yeah but a big rocks are falling
01:25:12 yeah I remember
01:25:14 meteors falling but the planet never blew up
01:25:16 it was never like that
01:25:18 it was on a thread of being blown up for a while
01:25:20 that's true I think I think it did canonically
01:25:22 like get blown up we just didn't see it
01:25:24 oh wait I thought I realized the way
01:25:26 I want the world to end is for a
01:25:28 hiveswap to come out and be good
01:25:30 because it'll never happen and it's shit
01:25:32 it's bad I actually
01:25:34 no idea I just like
01:25:36 I mean really the best way for the world to end like technically would be
01:25:38 we're already a galactic civilization
01:25:40 a lot of utilitarianism whatever
01:25:42 and we're just sort of having a kumbaya over it
01:25:44 as it descends into the sun in its final days
01:25:46 like yep it was fun but it's
01:25:48 dead now if we don't learn anything
01:25:50 new about like physics or any of that
01:25:52 shit which we probably will learn at least some things
01:25:54 but if we don't like yeah like there's no
01:25:56 way of avoiding like the heat death of the universe
01:25:58 so we're all gonna
01:26:00 it's gonna happen one day you know if we don't if we don't get our
01:26:02 shit together and I don't travel
01:26:04 you can fuck a lot of bitches in there
01:26:06 the amount of time it will take for the heat
01:26:08 death of the universe
01:26:14 the patron lounge
01:26:16 patreon.com
01:26:18 something what is it
01:26:20 the procrastinators everybody
01:26:22 if you want to spend a buck to get into this smug little
01:26:24 shitty chat room and talk to all these fucking
01:26:26 bitches come on in you can ask us
01:26:28 a question
01:26:30 mccoolman wants to know if you had
01:26:32 to body swap with any PCP member
01:26:34 for the rest of your life
01:26:36 who would it be
01:26:38 and I should mention before
01:26:40 anyone says anything
01:26:42 there's a user called kalope
01:26:44 or whatever and he says I would swap with munchy
01:26:46 because he seems at least depressed
01:26:48 well let me tell you
01:26:50 it's all an illusion
01:26:52 I think the only answer for me would be mage
01:26:54 just because it's like the mystery answer
01:26:56 because I don't know what she looks like
01:26:58 so I'm just gonna like cross my fingers and roll the die
01:27:00 that's the mystery box yeah that's a fair bet
01:27:02 that's not a bad choice
01:27:04 Tom I guess
01:27:06 I mean I don't like yourself
01:27:08 just because he's like the tallest
01:27:10 and I could fill out my frame and become
01:27:12 a non
01:27:14 a Lanclet God that's what I would do
01:27:16 a Lanclet God
01:27:18 yeah that's my answer
01:27:20 I'd go with myself and
01:27:22 that's it
01:27:24 boo
01:27:26 I'd go with his self as well
01:27:28 excellent
01:27:30 munchy alright
01:27:32 nobody wants to be Ben
01:27:34 you know what
01:27:36 my second answer was gonna be Ben
01:27:38 because Ben is genetically quite close to me
01:27:40 so that's not so bad
01:27:42 why even change then
01:27:44 but you have to
01:27:46 that's the question
01:27:48 if I had to
01:27:50 I would probably be digi
01:27:52 if I had to
01:27:54 I'd probably go into the body
01:27:56 of hippo
01:27:58 he is a powerful beast
01:28:00 if we're opening up to stuff like that
01:28:02 then I want to go into the body of the undertailer
01:28:04 the most powerful man
01:28:06 I thought you were already one of the undertailers
01:28:08 none of you want to be inside me
01:28:10 I definitely would pick hippo
01:28:12 because I kind of dig the idea
01:28:14 of being like small and skinny
01:28:16 like hippo doesn't like it so
01:28:18 if he switches with me I don't think he would mind
01:28:20 my body as much as his own for some reason
01:28:22 you seem to not like his body
01:28:24 so there you go
01:28:26 if I could choose myself I probably would
01:28:28 I can't choose yourself
01:28:30 yeah that's the whole thing
01:28:32 the whole body swap question
01:28:34 I don't believe that a consciousness exists
01:28:36 outside of mind
01:28:38 so if you transfer your quote-unquote consciousness
01:28:40 into someone else's body
01:28:42 then frankly you're just them now
01:28:44 it's literally a brain transplant
01:28:46 that works
01:28:48 I think I'd go with Ben
01:28:50 I think I'd go with Ben
01:28:52 disgusting
01:28:54 he's already me
01:28:56 I can know what it's like to rub my clit
01:28:58 boys
01:29:00 yeah that's fair
01:29:02 that's not a bad choice
01:29:04 I want that mage
01:29:06 clit baby
01:29:08 I'm sorry mage
01:29:10 please don't listen to this episode
01:29:12 okay
01:29:14 what do we got here
01:29:16 at Alan Oni
01:29:18 says a thing
01:29:20 imagine that for whatever reason
01:29:22 you have to go and pick up a girl
01:29:24 language isn't an issue
01:29:26 and anyone can be your wingman
01:29:28 imagine yourself boys
01:29:30 where you have to talk to a girl
01:29:32 what do you do
01:29:34 I would blow my fucking brains out
01:29:36 that's the answer
01:29:38 anyone differ from that
01:29:40 would we all commit suicide
01:29:42 I would say
01:29:44 hey baby what's shaking
01:29:46 is it my penis
01:29:48 yes it is
01:29:50 you have to pick up a girl
01:29:52 is it a date
01:29:54 is he picking her up from the airport
01:29:56 he's just lifting her up off the ground
01:29:58 let's assume he means a seduce
01:30:00 romantically express her interest
01:30:02 also my wingman
01:30:04 will be like a bird
01:30:06 and that will be the pun
01:30:08 and she'll be like oh what a funny pun
01:30:10 and that'll clinch it
01:30:12 it'll be a combination of the funny pun
01:30:14 and you asking her to
01:30:16 see your shaking penis
01:30:18 that will lose you
01:30:20 you hit it with a one two punch
01:30:22 first you hit it with a shaking dick
01:30:24 then you hit it with a bird pun
01:30:26 that's just the way you do it
01:30:28 user the jam from the patreon lounge
01:30:30 do you piss like an animal
01:30:32 by unbuttoning your pants and pulling your penis over your waistband
01:30:34 or do you use the zipper
01:30:36 and flap in the underwear like god tinge you to pee
01:30:38 I am unbuttoning your pants
01:30:40 and pulling your penis over the waistband 100%
01:30:42 I never use the fucking flap
01:30:44 in the other way it's fucking disgusting
01:30:46 and legitimately there's no reason to do it
01:30:48 it takes too long and it's too much of a fucking hassle
01:30:50 and it's just way easier to just whip it out
01:30:52 and fucking spray
01:30:54 I agree with that
01:30:56 the pressure from my waistband
01:30:58 and my pants pushing up
01:31:00 stops like the flow of pee
01:31:02 so I have to do it the other way
01:31:04 well I lifted up over the waistband
01:31:06 the waistband is just like on
01:31:08 my balls
01:31:10 I know what you're talking about but there's always a little bit
01:31:12 I actually mix it up
01:31:14 I basically undo my pants
01:31:16 but then I use the flap in the underwear
01:31:18 because that's the easiest way to do it
01:31:20 I'm in the middle
01:31:22 but you have to unbutton it
01:31:24 you have to reach in and find out where it is
01:31:26 there's no button in my underwear
01:31:28 there is a button on some of mine
01:31:30 actually the ones I'm wearing right now
01:31:32 underwear has a button on it
01:31:34 it does
01:31:36 I don't do it
01:31:38 I didn't even get into it until like two years ago
01:31:40 because I'd always seen it
01:31:42 going through the underwear
01:31:44 because I always knew that's what it was for
01:31:46 but I never thought to try it until like a while ago
01:31:48 and I was like okay
01:31:50 but the thing is
01:31:52 the last couple of drips of pee would go backwards
01:31:54 I don't know how common that is
01:31:56 that kind of gets on the pants if you're wearing the pants
01:31:58 so I'm just like eh
01:32:00 but I still do it if I
01:32:02 am listening to something in my ear buds on my phone
01:32:04 and I don't want to stop while I pee
01:32:06 and if it's in my pocket
01:32:08 it's going to have to go all the way
01:32:10 I don't want to mess with it
01:32:12 I don't want to stop
01:32:14 I just stick it out
01:32:16 if I'm listening to something on my phone
01:32:18 okay actually you guys
01:32:20 this was a test and you all failed
01:32:22 because what you all described was that
01:32:24 you are all doing the virgin pee
01:32:26 that's what you're doing
01:32:28 whereas I walk into the bathroom
01:32:30 I take my pants and underwear completely off
01:32:32 I stand at the urinal
01:32:34 I make eye contact with both people
01:32:36 surrounding me at the same time
01:32:38 and I piss a fucking ocean into the urinal
01:32:40 guys that's a lesson fun
01:32:42 but here I'm about to introduce you to the green piled
01:32:44 pee
01:32:46 this is for green pills only when you've aligned all your chopper
01:32:48 the Jill sign pee
01:32:50 this is the second dip
01:32:52 double dipping or whatever it was called
01:32:54 here's what you do
01:32:56 you walk into the bathroom and you go inside of the stall
01:32:58 and then you sit down to pee
01:33:00 that's the secret jujitsu that fucking
01:33:02 Donald Trump doesn't want you to see
01:33:04 he doesn't want you to know
01:33:06 that you're able to do that
01:33:08 if you go in the stall at least stand
01:33:10 and piss into the toilet
01:33:12 why do you have to sit on it
01:33:14 those are both embarrassing
01:33:16 the ability to pee standing up
01:33:18 you can pee standing up in a stall
01:33:20 but you just look like a bitch
01:33:22 why are you taking up a whole stall
01:33:24 if you don't have to know
01:33:26 your urinals are full of shit
01:33:28 if the urinals are full
01:33:30 it's fine that's no problem at all
01:33:32 but if you choose to pee into a toilet
01:33:34 first of all you're wasting more water
01:33:36 that's not grim tell
01:33:38 I will look down upon you as a man
01:33:40 you are not a man
01:33:42 what if you're a shy peer
01:33:44 and you just can't go in a urinal
01:33:46 well that's the thing this is a manliness test
01:33:48 I want to watch you pee
01:33:50 I want to see you pee and study you as a man
01:33:52 and know if you're worthy of my respect
01:33:54 but if you go into a stall you're a coward
01:33:56 and I don't respect you
01:33:58 in recent years I haven't gone on the urinal
01:34:00 but I still perceive myself as a person
01:34:02 who goes into the stall
01:34:04 most of the time
01:34:06 I don't usually pee alone
01:34:08 I usually pee with poop as well
01:34:10 understandable
01:34:12 understandable
01:34:14 what if it's like just a trough
01:34:16 and you don't want to pee in a trough like a pig
01:34:18 those aren't real
01:34:20 they are real
01:34:22 I was watching the screen junkies
01:34:24 and they went to the Emmys the other day
01:34:26 like the pre-Emmys not like the big important one
01:34:28 and the fucking bathroom at the Emmys after party
01:34:30 is a trough
01:34:32 you know you would expect something more extravagant
01:34:34 for this crazy big party
01:34:36 I go in the stall
01:34:38 but it's not because I don't want people to
01:34:40 see my pee-iness
01:34:42 it's just because
01:34:44 I mean it's more privacy
01:34:46 I don't know
01:34:48 I have too many
01:34:50 piss triplets afterwards
01:34:52 and there's no toilet paper at the urinal
01:34:54 that's really my reason
01:34:56 that's really my reason
01:34:58 the toilet paper isn't a thing
01:35:00 can't fault you for that
01:35:02 okay
01:35:04 what's the next question here
01:35:06 whenever I'm at a urinal
01:35:08 and I have to shake my dick to get all the driplets out
01:35:10 I'm just afraid it won't seem like I'm jerking off
01:35:12 into a urinal
01:35:14 I want them to think I'm jacking off into the urinal
01:35:16 you ever hear the phrase
01:35:18 that when a man walks into a room he takes his whole life
01:35:20 with him
01:35:22 that's what I think about every time I walk into the bathroom
01:35:24 everyone witness my science
01:35:26 witness my performance at the urinal
01:35:28 I'm a fucking man
01:35:30 I have trained myself
01:35:32 I've studied actual literature
01:35:34 about how to pee properly at a urinal
01:35:36 I know the score
01:35:38 and everyone who is not up to my level
01:35:40 I consider beneath me and a worthless human
01:35:42 see that makes you seem more self-conscious than the people
01:35:44 who just go in the store
01:35:46 cause you actually researched it to make sure you're doing it right
01:35:48 I don't give a shit
01:35:50 I just do whatever I want
01:35:52 yeah do whatever you want
01:35:54 hi you coward
01:35:56 charlotarianism
01:35:58 look donky go
01:36:00 okay here we go next question everybody
01:36:02 at hazelcracket on twitter asks
01:36:04 what would you consider a good gift
01:36:06 what are your parameters for a good gift
01:36:08 is that bullshit about
01:36:10 wanting someone to like the heartfelt
01:36:12 or like oh you made me a picture that all you could have made
01:36:14 or blah blah blah
01:36:16 if you're gonna give not money then I want to be like
01:36:18 I want to be like something that you like made
01:36:20 that's what I want
01:36:22 don't buy me like a thing
01:36:24 or give me a thing that you made
01:36:26 or give me money
01:36:28 or give me something that you could buy
01:36:30 but it's like a specific thing that you could buy
01:36:32 the question is what would you consider a good gift
01:36:34 but feel free to talk about bad gifts either
01:36:36 I mean for me it would be
01:36:38 me and sheep over are watching through
01:36:40 oh go ahead
01:36:42 something that would be very very useful
01:36:44 for a very long time
01:36:46 but would never be able to like get around
01:36:48 to buying like justifying the expense of
01:36:50 like my parents for Christmas
01:36:52 several Christmases ago got me like
01:36:54 a waterproof bluetooth speaker
01:36:56 so that you can like listen to like music
01:36:58 or podcast while taking a shower
01:37:00 and it is fucking awesome
01:37:02 and even if it ever breaks down I'll buy a new one
01:37:04 in a heartbeat but when I had the idea that
01:37:06 I have one I was like I don't know if I'm gonna use
01:37:08 that enough I just don't know
01:37:10 I don't want to drop the money so someone
01:37:12 breaking that damn like
01:37:14 violating that inertia for me was like great
01:37:18 the great thing about the gift thing
01:37:20 is that it's a certain amount of money
01:37:22 that like will be spent and you just get
01:37:24 to decide on what you have to spend it on
01:37:26 so it really gives you license to like
01:37:28 I mean if you can get like I do this with my parents all the time
01:37:30 like they ask what I want like for my birthday
01:37:32 whatever and then they'll buy like I mean a couple years ago
01:37:34 for Christmas they got me like the camera that I use
01:37:36 for like every video now and like
01:37:38 that was like I paid for like half of it but like
01:37:40 we worked out a deal just because like they want to get me something
01:37:42 I actually care about and like
01:37:44 so like that really emboldens you or kind of
01:37:46 forces you to purchase things that you are maybe on the fence about
01:37:48 that's honestly how I think about you know what
01:37:50 and also I never give gifts to anyone I don't have to
01:37:52 I have a real answer
01:37:54 the best gifts are gifts that are
01:37:56 not given on birthdays or holidays
01:37:58 because I realize I always get excited
01:38:00 surprise gifts I always get excited
01:38:02 not even like a surprise just something
01:38:04 like you know we're at a store like
01:38:06 oh that thing looks cool I'll buy it for you
01:38:08 really oh my gosh acquaintance of mine
01:38:10 or person who I know and love
01:38:12 it's like I don't know they didn't always feels
01:38:14 correct that how that's how giving
01:38:16 feels like it should feel to me
01:38:18 whereas the obligatory holidays
01:38:20 they never feel right to me
01:38:22 yeah I was going to say
01:38:24 something along those lines where
01:38:26 like a birthday or something
01:38:28 it feels like I'd be expected but when you get
01:38:30 something randomly from somebody it means
01:38:32 a lot more to me and I was saying
01:38:34 that me and sheep over started watching season one
01:38:36 of true detective because she hadn't seen it
01:38:38 and I pointed out
01:38:40 I pointed out that
01:38:42 the big hug mug that
01:38:44 Matthew McConaughey is using as an ashtray
01:38:46 was like a meme on 4chan
01:38:48 for a while and then like
01:38:50 three days later one shows up in the mail
01:38:52 and she's like oh yeah I bought one for you and I was like
01:38:54 oh well fucking shit and now I'm drinking out
01:38:56 of a big hug mug right now
01:38:58 I'd rather get it randomly than on my birthday
01:39:00 because then it's like well I guess you had to get me something
01:39:02 that's true I just never
01:39:04 expect kindness from anyone so
01:39:06 you know the way I
01:39:08 feel about stuff like that is that I would like
01:39:10 to be a person who gets gifts
01:39:12 randomly for people and
01:39:14 and doesn't have to do birthdays but that's not
01:39:16 how it works because they always expect it
01:39:18 so I feel like
01:39:20 to be a person who's that generous
01:39:22 you just need to give gifts
01:39:24 way more and I'm not like that
01:39:26 I'm not evil I don't
01:39:28 I never buy gifts for anyone that I can avoid doing it for
01:39:30 you know why would I I don't get it
01:39:32 it's not my thing it's still not about that life
01:39:34 and so I can't expect it to be done to me
01:39:36 oh yeah I never want gifts no one ever
01:39:38 get me a gift it's not it's not good but see
01:39:40 like the people who do like the with the
01:39:42 P.O. Box I'm doing like they're getting something in response
01:39:44 they're getting like my the their
01:39:46 presence in the video so like that's an equivalent
01:39:48 exchange going on I think so
01:39:50 yeah there you go
01:39:52 alright any more questions
01:39:54 from there or shall we take another one from here
01:39:56 no there's no more no okay
01:39:58 there's none on Twitter or on
01:40:00 Patreon we're all done
01:40:02 I'll at least suck
01:40:04 okay here we go here's one last question
01:40:06 J.H. The Hurricane
01:40:08 asks aliens
01:40:10 find us and lay siege to our planet
01:40:12 they'll destroy us unless we bring them
01:40:14 the best YouTube video
01:40:16 ever what's that video
01:40:18 the Japanese Juggalo Episode 1
01:40:24 the aliens will be like sitting like like
01:40:26 contouring super hard and they'll be like show me
01:40:28 your greatest piece of work
01:40:30 and then I'll like scurry off and I'll come back
01:40:32 and then they'll be like like put on their headphones
01:40:34 and they'll be anticipating there's complete silence
01:40:36 and then and then quaking
01:40:38 from inside of their fucking headphones
01:40:40 I'm all fed
01:40:42 it is me
01:40:44 D and their ears
01:40:46 fucking burst and their minds
01:40:48 blows and then they're all dead
01:40:50 instantaneously
01:40:52 you know what I do in this situation I would just lean over
01:40:54 I'd cock my eyebrow knowingly and just say
01:40:56 have you ever heard of a little guy called
01:40:58 leafy that's where I would go
01:41:00 yeah that's this one
01:41:02 he is here
01:41:04 I would say
01:41:06 digi brony off to dark
01:41:08 there it is
01:41:10 there it is
01:41:12 I tweeted that the other day
01:41:14 it was like a scary ghost
01:41:16 that wasn't a boo it was just a ghost sound
01:41:18 it's the ghost of digi
01:41:20 in the past when he actually made
01:41:22 brony content and it was good
01:41:24 unlike his new bullshit
01:41:28 garb I don't know what he's done to the editing
01:41:30 but like all the anime videos
01:41:32 editing that shit it's awful
01:41:34 I don't know what he's done to the videos
01:41:36 like now instead of like having
01:41:38 point characters on screen it's all just like humans
01:41:40 now and they're all like
01:41:42 they don't look too short
01:41:46 they didn't even leave because I said that joke did he
01:41:48 I have no idea who knows
01:41:50 man we'll fight out one day
01:41:52 I think there's no way
01:41:54 I mean it's way funnier if it was
01:41:56 just coincidentally he
01:41:58 dropped out
01:42:00 just so you know I've never actually
01:42:02 watched the digi videos so
01:42:04 my criticism doesn't stand because I don't know
01:42:06 if the editing is shit
01:42:08 no no no don't backpedal we know
