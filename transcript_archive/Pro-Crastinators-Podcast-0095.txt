00:00:22 It is the Gurren Lagann to the elections Kill La Kill.
00:00:25 All of these fucking psychopathic, Ben-Saintian, blue-pilled motherfuckers.
00:00:30 A depression quest. The greatest indie game in ever made.
00:00:34 Jeb was a fantastic character. I want his narrative to keep going.
00:00:37 God-tier Dorito, Dustin, Crustin, red-pilled motherfuckers who said,
00:00:41 No, not our video games.
00:00:43 You don't give a fuck about Gamergate, but Donald Trump, he's my dad.
00:00:47 You don't know shit until you hear about my boy, Ted Cruz.
00:00:51 That's patreon.com slash The Pro Crastinators, making bonus episodes great again, every single time.
00:01:22 Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators podcast.
00:01:31 It's me, your host, and your boy, Ben-Saint here.
00:01:34 And I'm here with Munchywares Tiny Hats.
00:01:38 Hey everyone, welcome to my Photoshop tutorial.
00:01:40 I'm going to be teaching you how to make a gradient transparent.
00:01:42 Let's start with the break-up of the Ottoman Empire.
00:01:44 It's going to be a really easy Photoshop tutorial.
00:01:46 I have to explain the entire history of the Middle East first, though.
00:01:48 What the fuck, and we're here with Tom Oliver.
00:01:52 I'm here talking about the topic.
00:01:55 I also, I had Zabram earlier, so I'm going to be silly today.
00:01:58 Let's do it.
00:01:59 Whoa, and there's also the best guy ever.
00:02:03 I did the mash.
00:02:05 I did the race war mash.
00:02:08 What? What is going on?
00:02:10 What were you doing earlier, and why didn't you invite me?
00:02:14 And in a rare twist of fate, we've got Lethal Aurora Mage.
00:02:19 Can this mean that I'm not on the podcast die already?
00:02:23 You have to fix it. You're the master of your own main destiny.
00:02:26 I was on the podcast like a month ago for the whole month.
00:02:30 Mage, you're the only female member of the PCP,
00:02:32 which means you have to be here five times as often to count for anything.
00:02:36 I haven't seen you been Lethal once.
00:02:39 You're a representative for your entire gender.
00:02:42 It's all writing on you.
00:02:44 My gender is purple. Excuse you.
00:02:46 You're the only purple gender on the podcast.
00:02:49 The PCP is the most gender-realist podcast on the net,
00:02:53 and we need the other side to be there as a strawman
00:02:56 that we can defeat week after week after week.
00:02:59 I personally find this very vivid aquamarine.
00:03:01 That's true. That's true.
00:03:03 Ben, why don't you tell us what the fuck we're doing, you baby boy?
00:03:09 We're talking about monsters,
00:03:12 which we thoroughly, thoroughly covered,
00:03:15 and pretty much said all there is to say about on the drawcast,
00:03:18 the ultimate PCP content.
00:03:21 They say a picture's worth a thousand words,
00:03:27 but if all those words are fucking bullshit,
00:03:29 you've got to come in with some real words that are targeted.
00:03:31 All we have to do is increase the number of word count in this episode
00:03:36 by number of pictures produced in that podcast,
00:03:38 multiplied by a thousand.
00:03:40 We just have to talk more than that,
00:03:42 which I think is an easily attainable goal.
00:03:44 One of these Superfans, Denix Jack,
00:03:46 count the number of words that are in this podcast
00:03:48 and tell us if we meet it.
00:03:50 What happened was me, Ben, and Major were all squibbling
00:03:54 in our scribed in, in the inner walls of Jericho,
00:03:58 and the villain thief, Nate, was peering over the palace walls,
00:04:02 trying to learn our trade secrets,
00:04:04 and so he banished forever from the garden of even
00:04:07 that is the PCP drawcast.
00:04:09 Like Adam before, cast Wrout into your drawcast.
00:04:12 He has to reverse this podcast, this drawcast topic,
00:04:15 so he can get his grubby fucking hands on it.
00:04:17 That's what's happened here today.
00:04:19 There was just too much, too much delicious, rich content
00:04:22 within the subject of monsters to just be left there
00:04:25 in the festering dirty floor of the drawcast.
00:04:30 There's never enough monsters if you ask me, so I'm here.
00:04:33 I don't know, I don't even think monsters are real guys.
00:04:36 Ben, I don't know what a monster is.
00:04:38 I've never had that explained to me before.
00:04:41 Can I, can I cut in here for a moment?
00:04:43 I would like to describe to everyone what exactly
00:04:45 a monster is that we're talking about.
00:04:47 Okay, so here we go.
00:04:48 Urban Dictionary, our old buddy, tells us
00:04:50 that a monster is nuclear horse piss
00:04:53 sold as a disgusting energy drink.
00:04:56 Oh shit!
00:04:57 What a monster is, yep.
00:04:59 Let's see what else we got here.
00:05:01 Describing anything that is large,
00:05:03 these are all part of one definition apparently.
00:05:06 The creature that lives in your closet and under your bed,
00:05:09 okay, and then one last one,
00:05:11 a sadistic pedophile who molests and rapes children he abducts.
00:05:15 Whoa, I didn't know Nick was a monster.
00:05:17 None of these descriptions describe monsters
00:05:21 that we're talking about.
00:05:22 Monsters are scary, mostly fuzzy things that go brar
00:05:26 and I go, ah!
00:05:28 I know about monsters.
00:05:30 I imagine monsters are like creatures that don't exist.
00:05:32 Monsters are like big men with rubber on their face.
00:05:35 All I know about monsters is that they're incorporated
00:05:38 and they're great people.
00:05:40 Monsters are usually fuzzy fucking government fat cats
00:05:45 who just want to subjugate the weak.
00:05:47 Alright, listen to this one more definition of monster.
00:05:49 This one is like the third most popular.
00:05:51 It's what you become when you break up with a girl.
00:05:54 What the hell is this?
00:05:57 Man, listen to this quote.
00:05:59 Man, we need to talk.
00:06:00 Woman, you're a monster.
00:06:02 Dude, that's some real shit, man.
00:06:07 That's fantastic.
00:06:08 Monsters are fake things that scare me.
00:06:10 I know.
00:06:11 Much like all fake things.
00:06:13 As I exist only and completely within the realm of reality.
00:06:17 Whenever I'm confronted with things that are not in fact real,
00:06:20 I can't contain my emotions
00:06:22 and all my anger and sadness flows out of my body
00:06:26 when I'm confronted with a fictional being.
00:06:29 Alright, let's go around real quick
00:06:31 and everybody talk about either your favorite
00:06:33 or a favorite monster of yours.
00:06:35 The Slender Man is a monster who has tentacles
00:06:38 and he's really tall and he is a black suit.
00:06:40 Dude.
00:06:41 And all the fucking other ones,
00:06:42 okay, Marble Hornets is the best fucking creepy ARG on the planet.
00:06:47 And all the bullshit, like Tribe 12 and fucking Everyman Hybrid,
00:06:50 all that shit is horrible.
00:06:51 I tried watching Everyman Hybrid and it fucking sucked shit.
00:06:54 It made no sense.
00:06:55 It was purposely just trying to be like a weird meta.
00:06:57 It was fucking like the reluctant YouTuber,
00:06:59 but if it was a Slender Man ARG,
00:07:01 that's what Everyman Hybrid is.
00:07:03 Marble Hornets was OG shit.
00:07:05 Marble Hornets is fucking,
00:07:07 what does Alicorn Twilight Princess Sparkle mean to you?
00:07:11 That's what fucking Marble Hornets is.
00:07:12 That's the real shit.
00:07:14 I love Marble Hornets.
00:07:15 Slender Man, he's not even called Slender Man that way.
00:07:17 He's called the operator.
00:07:18 You can operate your sickness if you look at him.
00:07:20 The screen shakes.
00:07:21 I have operate your sickness whenever I get on the PCP
00:07:23 because the PCP is just too powerful
00:07:25 and it reminds me too much of Slender Man.
00:07:27 Slender Man used to be my waifu before it was cool.
00:07:31 Really? Is that true?
00:07:32 Has anyone else seen Everyman Hybrid and Marble Hornets?
00:07:36 Because I actually have.
00:07:37 I have seen Marble Hornets.
00:07:39 No, I've never seen them been.
00:07:41 Well, I mean, besides you.
00:07:43 See, I saw them thinking that probably nobody else
00:07:46 on this podcast would have ever seen them.
00:07:48 I saw Marble Hornets.
00:07:49 Guys, guys, guys.
00:07:50 I knew about Slender Man before it became popular.
00:07:53 It was just around the time, just before it became mainstream.
00:07:57 I was fucking post about it on Reddit.
00:08:01 So I can upvote you then, god damn it.
00:08:03 I was fucking Marble Hornets before it was even done.
00:08:05 I was Marble Hornets before they even found out
00:08:08 that Tim was the mascot.
00:08:10 I'm fucking day one.
00:08:11 I'm fucking day fucking one.
00:08:13 Pulls off mask.
00:08:15 My face is revealed to be a hornet made of marble.
00:08:18 That's me.
00:08:19 I did it.
00:08:20 Am I the joke, guys?
00:08:22 That's good, right?
00:08:23 You would like Marble Hornets.
00:08:24 You would like it.
00:08:25 Because there's a bunch of fucking...
00:08:26 I'm googling it right now.
00:08:27 I'm looking at the weird spooky shit here.
00:08:29 There's a bunch of shit.
00:08:30 Oh, I think someone beats a woman in it one time.
00:08:32 Oh, hell yeah.
00:08:33 Me?
00:08:34 I watched the video.
00:08:35 It's me.
00:08:36 Yes.
00:08:37 How many episodes are there out there right now?
00:08:39 Marble Hornets just recording me.
00:08:40 It's like 107 or something, I think.
00:08:41 Oh, okay.
00:08:42 It's me in my daily life.
00:08:44 It's just what it is.
00:08:46 I caught up with Marble Hornets in one night.
00:08:49 Like procrastinating, going to sleep for like my first day of sixth grade.
00:08:52 Oh, this is a show.
00:08:53 Is this like a TV show?
00:08:54 No, it's a YouTube show.
00:08:55 It's like a webtoon.
00:08:56 Oh, okay.
00:08:57 It's like a YouTube series kind of semi-found footage photo documentary.
00:09:02 Exactly.
00:09:03 Trying to document this weird thing that happens.
00:09:05 It's an energy.
00:09:06 It's recorded in a way that looks realistic, but it's totally bullshit.
00:09:10 Okay.
00:09:11 How old is this thing?
00:09:12 It's very old.
00:09:13 It's a fictional story.
00:09:14 It's not like it's trying to trick you.
00:09:16 It's like it's a Blair Witch project.
00:09:18 Well, yeah.
00:09:19 It's a YouTube video series.
00:09:20 You know, that's the weird thing.
00:09:21 I feel like a lot of people, okay.
00:09:23 I mean, first of all, you've got like those girls who like literally tried to sacrifice
00:09:26 their friend in the woods to Slenderman, who is a literal made-up fake internet.
00:09:29 Who is me?
00:09:30 Who is me?
00:09:31 Which was Munchy.
00:09:32 Munchy was the girl being sacrificed and the people doing the sacrifice.
00:09:34 And Slenderman.
00:09:35 You know, it was a big thing.
00:09:36 And Slenderman.
00:09:37 He's basically the Trinity.
00:09:40 He's the father, son, and the Holy Ghost.
00:09:42 Sacrificing himself to himself to appease his own wrath upon the people he created.
00:09:46 That's who Munchy is.
00:09:47 Okay.
00:09:48 This is cool.
00:09:49 Well, what I was going to say is like, people really seem to like get whipped up into a storm
00:09:53 and like take this shit seriously.
00:09:55 And it's weird to me.
00:09:56 It's weird to me that people are so...
00:09:59 I mean, it's the...
00:10:00 What's the opposite of skeptical?
00:10:01 You know, like believers or something or have so much credulous.
00:10:05 I guess that...
00:10:06 Yeah, I think that's right.
00:10:07 People like look for things to believe in like this.
00:10:09 And I've never understood that.
00:10:11 I guess because it's fun.
00:10:12 I guess because it's just fun.
00:10:13 Eggs.
00:10:14 You know?
00:10:15 What other reason do you need?
00:10:16 Yeah.
00:10:17 I don't know.
00:10:18 Like, is it fun to sacrifice your friend in the woods to Slenderman?
00:10:20 Yeah, because Slenderman like you then.
00:10:22 I know.
00:10:23 People like spooky stories.
00:10:25 Dude.
00:10:26 Oh.
00:10:27 Isn't that a fascinating thing though?
00:10:28 Why do people like being scared?
00:10:29 You know, I also don't quite get it.
00:10:31 I'm not as into it as I feel like a lot of people are.
00:10:34 As I said in the Ghost episode, ghosts aren't real, but they should be.
00:10:38 Right.
00:10:39 And I love ghosts.
00:10:40 And if I pray every night at some day they'll magically become real and I'll be able to
00:10:45 see a ghost with my own eyes.
00:10:47 Just like in season three of Korra where all the airbenders just literally became real
00:10:51 again.
00:10:52 It was awesome.
00:10:53 So good.
00:10:54 What a great development.
00:10:55 I love Korra.
00:10:56 Me too, dude.
00:10:57 That's some fucking...
00:10:58 Korra!
00:10:59 I just want to put it out there.
00:11:00 Korra is my favorite monster.
00:11:01 She is the most evil being who ever existed.
00:11:04 She makes the world a worse place with her mere presence.
00:11:06 The monsters don't always have to be evil to go.
00:11:09 Yes.
00:11:10 But Korra is.
00:11:11 Korra is undeniably evil.
00:11:12 Yeah.
00:11:13 I'm just making a statement.
00:11:14 Yeah.
00:11:15 That's true.
00:11:16 And you were saying this on the draw cast too.
00:11:17 You're a staunch defender of monster rights.
00:11:19 Yes.
00:11:20 Yeah.
00:11:21 Okay.
00:11:22 Okay.
00:11:23 We must defend a monster free speech.
00:11:24 It's important.
00:11:25 People like monsters because they put you closer to death and what do we all want but
00:11:29 death?
00:11:30 We all seek oblivion.
00:11:31 Blindly.
00:11:32 Now I'm speaking my language.
00:11:33 And I quickly just mentioned a dream I had before this podcast.
00:11:36 It has a monster in it.
00:11:37 And I just wanted to...
00:11:38 Sure.
00:11:39 Okay.
00:11:40 So quickly I'll try.
00:11:41 Okay.
00:11:42 So the dream.
00:11:43 Man-made island and on the island is just nothing but this big building and I live there
00:11:47 and there's a mansion and other people and slowly one by one people are getting murdered
00:11:52 in very horrible ways.
00:11:53 You just see the bodies laying on the floor and just blood everywhere and they kept getting
00:11:58 dragged away and like me and the manager trying to figure out what's happening.
00:12:02 And then like I finally found out that like there's this monster here like and it's trying
00:12:06 to kill us.
00:12:07 And I was one of the few people left alive and the only reason I was left alive because
00:12:12 I kind of like casually flirted with the monster.
00:12:15 The monster just noked away.
00:12:18 I guess he didn't like me.
00:12:22 I'm sad.
00:12:23 But I like the monster a lot.
00:12:26 He was really cool.
00:12:27 He had like this skull face thing but not like a human skull.
00:12:31 It was like a like a deer skull or something.
00:12:34 And like these huge claws that he would rip people up and stuff and he was just he looked
00:12:40 really cool.
00:12:41 Your description sounds like that anime.
00:12:43 You know that one it's like it's called like a necromancer bought me or something.
00:12:46 It's like about a literal slave was bought by like this necromancer with a big skull.
00:12:50 I forget.
00:12:51 I have not seen that anime.
00:12:52 You know what I'm talking about.
00:12:53 Okay.
00:12:54 Well whatever.
00:12:55 I think I've heard of something like I heard yeah Twitter talking about something Stockholm
00:12:59 syndrome yada yada but no I haven't seen that anime I should look into that.
00:13:05 Maybe it's a sign.
00:13:07 I did a nightmare as well last night where I was on my computer and some invisible force
00:13:12 some some invisible insidious force moved my hand for me and made me type into my my
00:13:18 Google search bar laying with a bunch of pop up ads and you know I try to download various
00:13:24 like 40 cute clickers click down this ad and now my my my search bar is just filled the
00:13:29 brim with malware and very sorts of spyware I my my hand was trembling moving towards
00:13:34 that I typed in atop the fourth wall and I watched the newest link our video his videos
00:13:40 for Shaz seeking into my fucking soul like like like you like Photoshop color burn his
00:13:46 face color burning my layer completely obliterate all all sense of like pores on my body and
00:13:52 seeking into my into my fucking vessel like that's what link are you know with with a new
00:13:56 age with a new media platform we get a whole new wave of monsters out with the old universal
00:14:02 monsters now we get like the link cars as our poster style yes he has a magic gun where
00:14:09 did he purchase that that is what's the deep lore there we have a real life fucking don't
00:14:16 know but I want to donate to our PayPal to get us to remake all the universal monster
00:14:20 movies but with various that guy with the glasses crew members oh plugging real quick
00:14:24 Kickstarter still happening everybody please give to the fucking Radcon three Kickstarter
00:14:28 we need that money so I forget we can dress up as monsters in real life I if we're close
00:14:35 enough to woods I'll pretend to be the Jersey Devil on film that's a promise that's gonna
00:14:42 be a yeah go ahead back to slender man Ben what what did you think of every man hybrid
00:14:47 compared to marble hornets I didn't watch that much every man hybrid because it wasn't
00:14:52 that good yeah it's so it was it was fucking it was horrible like like a meta bullshit it
00:14:57 was it was fucking like dude home suck is so meta I love accents that's that's that's
00:15:02 a horrible horn that that's what I mean marble I mean marble hornets had some intrigue like
00:15:08 the barn and stuff yeah is Kino I barely remember anything from from every man hybrid at first
00:15:16 I thought that it was like at first I thought that it was kind of funny that it was framed
00:15:22 as they were making a YouTube show yeah some other kind that became a slender man thing
00:15:28 because slender man was there but yeah that didn't carry it for very here here here let
00:15:33 me explain everything hybrid to you so the gimmick of the channel is that it's these
00:15:37 like like three like bros make you like a fitness channel and then like like episode two slender
00:15:42 man is is like just awkwardly put into like the background of videos and then they're like
00:15:48 we were making a slender man ARG but now slender man is real and he's really trying to kill
00:15:54 us yeah oh I forgot about that yeah not not great fucking a fucking pitiful display every
00:16:02 man hybrid fucking you know they probably got like a cp they probably got like yeah they
00:16:06 should they probably got like exposed or something like in some way they like couldn't deny that
00:16:10 they were like doing things related to slender man in some way so they had to like rationalize
00:16:14 it somehow like I would it just seems like such a dumb idea to like admit that you like
00:16:18 we're from the start doing a thing with a slender man yeah like it just seems counter
00:16:22 to your narrative like acknowledges the fakeness of the whole thing oh yeah so like there's
00:16:27 no way I'm gonna take it seriously now in any way and then the fucking rake comes in
00:16:31 because just like that shows like another like creepypasta TM character that we can just
00:16:35 like like steal from another story just put in our fucking thing because we're hacks
00:16:39 speaking of YouTube stuff have you guys heard or seen poppy poppy yes yes poppy is a good
00:16:49 monster on YouTube yes interesting I don't know what her endgame is I guess release albums
00:16:55 and just be a weird oh on the internet um yeah she's cool she's got some poppy I don't think
00:17:01 she's active anymore is poppy like a monster no I mean poppy is a weird creepy semi-robotic
00:17:10 possibly internet creature maybe I don't like I've seen some of her videos and I don't know
00:17:19 what she is but I kind of like the associations will illuminati the devil and the possibility
00:17:24 that she's actually like a clone of herself well well they are been on explainer they're
00:17:29 both the same to me poppy is this fake pop star on YouTube who makes music videos like
00:17:37 you know top 40 like Katy Perry shit but she has sinister undertones in between music videos
00:17:43 which have you know they're just like fucking what I get fucked in my ass you know stuff
00:17:48 like that like put your hooves up I don't know about well okay between those she has I guess
00:17:55 I would call them like vlogs they're not like like hey YouTube they're like her staring
00:18:01 at the camera and kind of yeah there's like a childishly mumbling about things about how
00:18:08 she like she like loves her like Lord and she makes like five or six minutes of her just
00:18:13 saying that she's poppy and like ASMR and stuff yeah yes that's right that's right she's
00:18:18 like weird creepo ASMR in a way but mostly she's just obviously a bizarre freak and in the
00:18:24 best way I like her a lot I I really wonder what the endgame is here I think about that
00:18:31 all the time like what is the point of all these I guess the medium is the message I
00:18:35 suppose just doing these weird videos are just fun for these people I assume I don't know
00:18:40 it's something about fucking Illuminati and fucking you know like celebrities and shit
00:18:44 but fucking I don't know if there's like a message per se I think it's just like art
00:18:48 just like displaying this idea of like you know celebrities being like aliens and shit
00:18:54 like yes it's definitely that yeah it's definitely an artistic piece the character of poppy which
00:18:59 I is really cool I'm watching one called Dracula glam right now it's sick as shit she's just
00:19:05 like gnashing her teeth with these fucking vampire fangs and for no reason well this
00:19:11 spooky ambient music plays and then she's opening a box called nightmares at the end
00:19:16 of the video and she's bashing with a fucking bat incredible incredible I saw that's that's
00:19:22 yeah the stakes are really getting raised on the poppy show um yeah she's a fantastic
00:19:28 monster of the internet I love her let's talk about the greatest villain and monster of
00:19:33 all time binge Dr. Wolf Dr. Wolf works too I feel like they're intertwined binge run

00:20:41 me you know I played Pokemon go before it was cool meaning as soon as it came out and
00:20:46 everyone immediately started playing but the real question is do you continue to play it

00:21:20 was a crow what even is that no you know what is this a bird get out of here there are only
00:21:26 realistic monsters in Pokemon dragons raw raw turtles black people you know the classics
00:21:37 exactly drawing inspiration from the real world Digimon are also cool monsters I love Digimon
00:21:45 fucking suck did you know shit I'm gonna punch you I'm fucking skull graymon I've got like
00:21:56 a thousand skulls attached to my fucking face with a fucking gigantic cannon and I'm like we are
00:22:01 like dragon dinosaur what is that it's the most complicated design I've ever seen in my fucking
00:22:06 there was there was machined Ramon and yeah metal and mecha height mecha dragonmon and puppet
00:22:13 mon and Piedmon and Piedmon was a clown you can't argue with that what the fuck are you
00:22:19 strongest strongest enemy in season one he didn't fuck around what are we discussing are these
00:22:26 politics yes the politics of the digital world love one is best Digimon do we do we impeach
00:22:35 love but he's keeping shit let me make sure I want to Google this what is it apmon it's
00:22:42 it's like a brown bunny with the horn super cute I got it oh he's pretty cute yeah and he
00:22:58 and he has like a dual evolution like he can he like an evil side in the light side and well it's
00:23:03 just it's that it's just like me guys look at this guy though hey incredible do you oh my god
00:23:13 do you guys you guys know how how digimon was founded do you do you know the origin story
00:23:17 you need to you need to you need to look up lady devimon then you'll be converted to we all know
00:23:22 how to start you know the the creative poke bunch sirgi Miyamoto what was touching some bugs but
00:23:29 do you know how digimon was made digimon was was you know you know during the japanese air raids
00:23:34 you know you know you know well will be bombed to shit the creator of digimon uh james digimon
00:23:40 was was was fucking sliding out of his war torn country he was his home roof collapsed upon him
00:23:48 and he was crawling out like inch by inch and he stumbled and staggered a chest ripped completely
00:23:55 open out of his japanese city and wandered into the nearby mounds and inside inside a pit a thousand
00:24:01 trucks long he descended and saw not one but two computers and thought i can make a i can make a game
00:24:08 out of this or or whatever digimon is i don't know that's the origin story it was and then he
00:24:17 heard those hear that ancient american war song hey we're champions and he was like wait
00:24:26 i'm james digimon i can work with this i can make something happen here and the rest was history
00:24:34 um incredible i'm glad we solved this crisis when louis and clark were doing the expedition
00:24:39 of the pacific coast they came across a wandering tribe unlike any any engines they had seen before
00:24:47 they were all playing their tamagotchi tm around their circles screaming various back in those days
00:24:53 you'd have to get a literal chicken to lay an egg that you would carve into a digivice so that's
00:24:57 how you would connect with your fucking digimon uh things have evolved since then obviously but
00:25:06 yeah exactly well that's digimon for you we've solved it uh uh yeah digimon uh superior pokemon
00:25:15 this is the superior franchise well here's proof that's not true because look at the screenshot
00:25:21 nate just put in that's proof the digimon is shit how dare you get a fuck he's wearing a little
00:25:29 he's wearing a little color i'm gonna have to prove all of you wrong but that color is decidedly
00:25:34 unpopped you but it's probable you know he's about to pop it okay he's about to pop it or
00:25:40 i'm not gonna stop his head with one finger no no look he's fucking gray and brown i don't
00:25:45 believe ever he's boring uh but no as bad look look you can think whatever you want about lot
00:25:50 mod but let me let me ask you this like how can you disagree with that that's fucking retarded
00:25:56 that's the that's the worst thing i've ever seen in my life that is the antithesis of quality
00:26:02 lady devimon the best her upper arm reaches her hips yeah exactly well you know that's just how
00:26:10 they roll the digital world they were able to digitally enhance and enhance and enhance the
00:26:15 length of that arm just looks like oh wait a minute wait a minute ben that's actually like
00:26:19 correct look at this other perspective of this fucking character her arm is decidedly weirdly
00:26:24 huge she goes to her fucking ankles um all right well she's christ enough in enough digimon
00:26:33 no no no this character looks like i'm just getting started this character looks like a like a
00:26:38 discorded grim dark sabre spark that's what that like human looks like a human that's clearly the
00:26:45 best thing in the world so you're just you're just proving my point right now well listen guys okay
00:26:51 the digimon are really cool and all but but and and yes digimon were the original monsters but
00:26:55 frankly i'm a little more interested in talking about like the people who are inspired by characters
00:27:00 like lady devimon as the as the monsters of the modern age a lot uh adolf hitler for example i
00:27:05 thought you were going to say women which i was going to say was definitely the worst monsters
00:27:09 should have gone with women i would like to nominate a group of monsters like like like i would
00:27:14 like to nominate a monster as the like number one monster in all categories all fear in fields
00:27:21 here it goes here's my nomination every creature in the ocean every single one of them are fucking
00:27:28 monsters the deeper you go the work the more monstery they are every single creature in the
00:27:34 ocean is despicable nihilistic uh they're pragmatic they're capitalist they're fucking they're all of
00:27:41 the things that you don't want a thing to be and they're all of them and yet still even more they
00:27:47 they're their scale of monster to priest is full monster full monster they're so creepy look look
00:27:55 just google like ocean and you'll see shit you don't want to see there are murkabahs are 100
00:28:00 inverted it's a nightmare down there i don't believe i don't believe in anything below sea level
00:28:07 yeah i don't either they're i've never look at this this is one this is one of the well-known
00:28:12 ones this is one of the ones like people like tankling oh yeah i know what that is look at this
00:28:17 i linked lotus oh look at that oh what the fuck is this okay it's a demon sharks are good boys
00:28:22 shut up that's a demon he looks like a he looks like a medium boy at best to me he's a good boy
00:28:29 oh he will murder you though no he has the chance no but what if he did
00:28:38 sharks can we afford to take that chance not not only are there hideous monsters such as octopi
00:28:44 and starfish in the ocean there's also the lowest rung on the pcp iceberg
00:28:51 oh that pcp fan iceberg yes is that a dolphin or a beluga whale it's the lowest rung mate that's
00:28:57 a beluga but yeah right i was gonna say beluga oh oh i love lilymon i love lilymon too lilymon was
00:29:04 great um i also really like garudamon garudamon was my favorite ultimate and lilymon but that was
00:29:10 not like he's like a native american bird looking dude right yeah uh yeah kind of he actually looks
00:29:15 exactly like blaziken in every way only better god uh yeah he's sick also he's got he's been
00:29:21 designing so much more busy he's literally got like a fucking bandana and like all these weird
00:29:26 mart including some fucking kanji and a weird helmet with like lines on it what the fuck is
00:29:30 god that's too much it's too much i'm being scared by ocean things i'm on google image i'm
00:29:34 being scared by ocean guys no no no wait hold on hold on hold on guys the ocean itself best girl
00:29:41 though who's the quiaman hold on sequoia man dude the ocean itself not even the ocean you you
00:29:49 fucking go to the seafloor and you're crushed by pressures grave the geothermal chemistry of life
00:29:55 human to calm down and look at the kriamon is i'm with bunchy though boiling me it's boiling
00:30:01 the ocean itself is the worst monster of all i was just gonna say just like how uh the skin is
00:30:06 the largest organ on the human body even though that's a lie and i don't believe it for one second
00:30:10 similar the ocean is the largest monster in the world i am the ocean do you know what comes from
00:30:14 the ocean though the king of the monsters himself god zilla the greatest true of all time uh destroys
00:30:20 your cities fucks your bitches and doesn't give a shit the greatest monster okay here's a real
00:30:26 question the ocean or am i wrong he does he lives in like an alternate dimension but comes from the
00:30:32 ocean in the the short story the call of kathulu where they're running away from the island and
00:30:37 kathulu himself rises from the ocean and is undecried but strikes fear into the hearts of all
00:30:43 who witnessed it i have heard of being described as a a like a water elemental guy like a water
00:30:51 kind of i mean it's all made up bullshits with a fanfic monster so he brought us tentacle porn
00:30:55 so therefore not a monster but a god for all of us to worship it's true uh lovecraft and some good
00:31:02 stuff i really love kathulu's appearance in the my love pony fanfiction my love pony the nae of kathulu
00:31:07 i really like that one i don't even know if you're bullshitting because that sounds a hundred
00:31:13 you can read that if the full length of that on uh on on fanfiction on fanfiction.net you can read
00:31:19 that all there yeah i was gonna say that um listen guys this is all good and all but here's a serious
00:31:25 question i want to add this is a serious question can a human be a monster yes in whatever way you
00:31:32 divide it yeah okay are we all just gonna say yes because like what does a monster actually mean
00:31:36 all all it takes is you just gotta put you just gotta put chopsticks in your mouth and stick the
00:31:41 the top of your nostrils yeah if you're a monster there you go you've left your humanity behind
00:31:47 and okay well you've become something greater here's why i'm curious are you trying to get some
00:31:52 intellectual discourse out of this shit show of a podcast right now maybe i would never attempt that
00:31:57 we'll see what happens uh okay so like no person ever thinks that they're a villain right so like in
00:32:02 their own mind they think they're doing like what's best i mean some people are psychopaths so like
00:32:06 they're the exception but like a guy like hitler for example thought he was doing what's best for
00:32:11 like germany probably as is the pcp as is that we'll do whatever it takes he'll do whatever it takes
00:32:17 so like he probably would not call himself even evil you know let alone a monster and of course
00:32:23 most of the world would disagree obviously uh but like i don't know does that does that count this
00:32:28 comes down to your to whether you think there's a subjective or objective view of reality if you
00:32:34 say there's an objective morality and objective standards and of course hitler's a monster and he
00:32:39 was just uh completely off his rocker but if you're a post-modernist kind of guy who's like
00:32:45 everything's subjective like no from hitler's perspective he wasn't so he wasn't and there's
00:32:48 no way of judging it's there's no way of saying what a monster is or isn't because there's no
00:32:52 objective standards anyways well there's no objective standards there are consent there's
00:32:57 consistent standards there's there's consistent whatever that word is however you say that one
00:33:03 i mean there's a lot a lot of people think he's a monster so for all intents and purposes he's
00:33:08 basically objectively a monster yeah i mean i hear what you're saying that's a fair point well
00:33:12 that just means that ever that just means that individual people think that he is i think a lot
00:33:18 of them do though a lot of them most of them in fact well i mean it's all it's all the individual's
00:33:24 opinion right if there are multiple individuals there is no actual like thing that is the
00:33:31 collective will it's not actually a real thing it is just a force kind of in society and you know
00:33:37 that's playing guilty gear where there's the universal will which i'll talk about in my lecture
00:33:41 at rack on three excellent fun the kickstarter fun the kickstarter click the description what do you
00:33:47 mean there's no force like like there's no like like the i mean okay well it's not think something
00:33:53 because it's not like a real thing but a lot of if a lot of people individually think something
00:33:59 and those the people in society then it's not okay here's here's an easy way to think about
00:34:04 things some way here's an easy way to to kind of like refute that it's just like okay so let's
00:34:09 say like literally everyone on earth believes things are a certain way then let's just say that
00:34:13 that whole population of humans just gets like dropped rick and morty style into a like galactic
00:34:17 population and now there's like trillions and trillions of other people who just totally
00:34:21 believe that morality works a different way so now what was the majority opinion is no longer the
00:34:26 majority opinion within like the actual population of like sentient beings it's like in an instant you
00:34:32 can like change how morality works like on a on the you know on the large scale so like it doesn't
00:34:37 actually it doesn't like scale that kind of approach like static it evolves with the society
00:34:46 so i don't know how are you trying to prove that like well i'm trying to prove that there is no
00:34:51 actual thing that is like a collective will it's it's that that is just the sum of the individual
00:34:56 people's will and like those are the things that one should try to change and that's what actually
00:35:00 matters like it's like if one yeah an example like that back in very old medieval days or whatever
00:35:06 uh people from europe when they were fighting people from where do elephants come from africa
00:35:10 or whatever like and they were like oh shit monsters but then you know they gain knowledge
00:35:19 about the topic and it turns out elephants are good boys not monsters that's true the the whole
00:35:24 whether or not to monster thing applies to animals just as well as it does to human beings
00:35:28 hashtag elephants are not monsters everybody stop the stigma and this hate
00:35:32 hashtag giraffes are monsters though have you ever seen a giraffe fight something it's fucking brutal
00:35:37 it does not i've seen every day of my fucking life because i get savaged by action giraffe
00:35:44 despite his emaciated body he still retains 90 percent of his full fighting powers you can't you
00:35:50 can't get rid of that fighting instinct that's right that that's his body material but his spirit
00:35:59 indeed indeed that's why he continues to place well in the pcp royal rumble that's true god i can't
00:36:05 wait for another fucking rumble so we can have action giraffe be back in the ring i can't fucking
00:36:10 wait and watch all my fucking characters get destroyed instantly again as they always do why
00:36:15 what did i fucking do okay well we'll see fucking donate donate to the kickstarter everybody
00:36:22 uh god what else is the rake i felt like the rake what is this rake you mentioned that before
00:36:28 but you didn't describe it dropping i'm so glad you weren't hosting this one because you don't
00:36:32 know fucking anything apparently i don't i don't i'm not i'm actually i'm gonna save my rake discourse
00:36:38 for the creepypasta episode because because evidently that's all i that's all the things i have to
00:36:42 say about monsters is from creepypasta okay okay fair enough oh by the way quick point as to why
00:36:49 objective reality is true uh it is objective uh what was the word morality is true uh to what
00:36:57 someone was saying before it's because there are baseline fundamentals that we can understand
00:37:01 consciousness is real as far as we can tell consciousness is at least real for you and there
00:37:06 are things that are and i know this is gonna sound like some fuzzy language but we can generally
00:37:11 all agree on things that are largely true even if there are some exceptions fuzzy like
00:37:15 things like fuzzy life is generally preferable to death too fuzzy pleasure is generally preferable
00:37:22 to pain generally but we know these things are like that is that is all just a matter of opinion
00:37:29 no one comes down to the individual to decide what is preferable okay but but if things apply to
00:37:34 like 99.9 percent of the population is it really correct then it applies that's what i was just
00:37:39 saying throw it out the window that's what i was just saying there's nothing outside of the person's
00:37:44 preferences that is made real by those preferences okay but it's okay well for example newtonian
00:37:49 physics is not 100 percent it does not fully map out reality but we still use it practically
00:37:55 to determine all kinds of stuff about the real world so it's super useful so in the same way
00:38:00 more our moral systems are maps to optimize the way we want society well newtonian physics isn't
00:38:06 real i well yeah i mean that that is true it is it is just a way of understanding shit no
00:38:12 that is not completely accurate guys that's that's not fucking even real because physics is mapping
00:38:18 out a thing that exists in the world and like morality is mapping out what people think about
00:38:23 consciousness then it's all preference it's it's opinion all the way down question like
00:38:29 would you prefer to get punched in the face or get it or get a free milkshake um milkshake but
00:38:36 that's just that's all the boys i might if i was if i was feeling really bad about myself i might
00:38:41 want to get punched in the face okay what if a bunch of bullies were coming to beat you up good
00:38:46 what if a bunch of bullies were coming to literally beat you up real real bad and your friend said like
00:38:51 oh here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna punch you in the face so that you look like you've already
00:38:55 been beat up and they won't beat you up even worse and in that case getting punched in the face might
00:39:00 be a better idea than getting a milk you're changing the you're changing the situation yeah well what
00:39:06 is the situation we didn't get punched in the face so you get an offer get punched in the face or get
00:39:12 a free milkshake okay but the whole this doesn't actually prove anything this is just showing what
00:39:17 we personally want the real monsters are people who wax philosophically for no reason on podcast
00:39:23 you're all about i hate you you're fucking general preference implies some kind of greater truth
00:39:29 stupid uh there there is too large your truth you guys you just we just it was gonna be a podcast
00:39:35 where we have fun talking about monsters and now you're just i'm having a great time
00:39:39 here's the real monster the philosophical insights of who's a monster and who's not but that's
00:39:45 essential uh you can't describe something unless you know what it is you know what you know what
00:39:49 What's a monster?
00:39:50 Monsters are like porn, you know what you see them, god damn it!

00:40:48 through the camera but like the camera extends it so it's like this long like
00:40:52 tube thing. I think they're actually called rods. I think they're like called
00:40:57 rods. Yeah. They were in a JoJo chapter. I think rods might be my favorite. Crypto
00:41:01 cryptocurrency. Well I know that rods trade exclusively in Bitcoin.
00:41:09 Yes. Which is why I'm trying to collect them so that I can enter their economy.
00:41:13 Bitcoin taking a beating right now under under 8,000.
00:41:15 Munch, can you like post a rod? I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
00:41:19 Just read JoJo part six. There's a part where I don't actually know.
00:41:24 I'll post a picture of rods. In case any of you needed convincing, this is proof
00:41:29 that the Mothman is in fact real and he's not like a fantasy thing. He's real.
00:41:32 Here's proof. Okay. There he is. I'm convinced. The Mothman is real everybody.
00:41:39 Oh no. I see no reason to doubt this whatsoever. This is less floofy. This
00:41:43 doesn't look like a Moth. This looks like a bat.
00:41:46 The bat man is real. I'd like to nominate this as the best monster of all time.
00:41:53 This looks like the one. You got this shit. Oh no. You found that right now because you
00:42:01 were searching for rod monster didn't you? That's exactly because I found the
00:42:04 same one. Oh hell yeah. Okay. I really touched about enemy earlier and I just
00:42:09 wanted to say there's had a lot of like like monster grills and I want more
00:42:13 monster boys please. That would be nice. Yeah okay. Okay. I just wanted to make
00:42:18 that statement also. You will never know the pleasure that I feel whenever I go
00:42:24 to Egypt and I plunder tombs sanctioned off by the government for being too
00:42:29 culturally significant. I plunder them anyway outside the the prying eyes of
00:42:34 the government. I plunder those tombs. I raid those caverns and I party down
00:42:40 with the mummies the various mummies that line the underground layers of
00:42:44 Egypt. I do that every single day and that's why mummies are the number one
00:42:48 monster because they are party animals. They want to get down just like I
00:42:52 want to do. They want to get down. They want to put their hooves up and they
00:42:55 love they love drinking booze and love fucking sluts just like I do. That's
00:42:59 that's nice but fuck the mummies. The coolest monsters were these. The only one
00:43:03 ever to play with these back in the day. That was the coolest shit of all time.
00:43:08 They were like they were like monster trucks that turned into actual monsters.
00:43:12 It was the coolest shit ever. Okay that is awesome but something looks vaguely
00:43:16 familiar. I think I might have seen commercials for them. Dude they were so
00:43:19 vaguely terrifying. They were like cars that like transformed into like monsters.
00:43:25 They have like giant mouths and they eat eight shit. It was it was fucking. Does it
00:43:28 like exude slime or something? Because I'm seeing some slime. Some of them some of
00:43:31 them do. That one did I believe. Oh my god this is up my alley. This is up my alley.
00:43:36 Into the fucking podcast because this is going to be a nightmare because no one
00:43:40 can see what the fuck we're talking about. We're giving this one a give. He's gonna
00:43:43 end all of these for being late. I'll put all these in the show notes. Click on the
00:43:48 link in the description you can see all of these. Okay fantastic. Okay here's a
00:43:53 thing we're doing this real quick. We're gonna go through all the universal
00:43:55 monsters and give them a score out of ten. All right here we go. Starting number
00:43:59 one Frankenstein zero. What Frankenstein's monster four. Frankenstein's monster yes.
00:44:05 Oh we're talking about the monster than a ten out of ten. The monster's a good
00:44:10 boy. I like him. He's a flesh golem. He's sick. I don't know. He's fine. He's a
00:44:17 little bland. I never read the book. I only played the video game. The most
00:44:23 interesting thing about Frankenstein's monster is Frankenstein himself who would
00:44:26 just bring a guy alive for some reason. But okay. Actually Frankenstein was the
00:44:30 real monster. If I remember the lore correctly he was. No no it was the mob
00:44:35 that was the real monster. No Frankenstein was a dick. No our real monsters was the
00:44:42 real monster. Okay good. He's zero out of ten. Count Dracula. Count Dracula. Seven.
00:44:48 He's got a funny accent. I like the fact he's a foreigner so I can make fun of him
00:44:52 without any moral justification. Dracula is honestly more boring than Frankenstein.
00:44:59 No Dracula's great. He has fucking teeth that he makes you go bye bye with. Dracula has to
00:45:05 be the best monster because he's a real person. He's not some fucking joke. He's real.
00:45:11 Nosferatu's are sick. I would give a Nosferatu like an eight out of the gate but this is
00:45:15 Count fucking Dracula. He's a bitch. Whatever. He's gay. The Wolfman. Oh that one is like
00:45:21 the worst one of all. He's fucking zero. Zero. He's a furry. He's a furry. I give him
00:45:28 one point out of ten for being ten percent real. That sounds good. He's a little bit
00:45:34 real but not enough to make the cut. I have never liked the Wolfman. I'm giving him like
00:45:40 a two. What is cool about him? He is a wolf. He's a fur sona. He is a wolf. Okay but you
00:45:46 know that guy is like in there was that one kid who's like in every way other than physical.
00:45:51 I am a wolf. Barks. This guy is actually a little bit along that. He is slightly physically
00:45:56 a wolf as well. So in that way I give him bonus points. And he goes aloo. He does. I like
00:46:02 him. Okay. What else? For some reason also in this line is Van Helsing is here for some
00:46:07 reason. Oh I love the anime. That was a sick anime. I'm going to give him like a I don't
00:46:16 know he's pretty cool. I get to five just for because Helsing the anime exists because
00:46:21 of that. Yeah. Yeah. Wait what is the real Van Helsing? Is he a real person? He's just
00:46:27 a dude who went around killing monsters. That's what he did. So he's a monster hunter not
00:46:32 a monster. He's like blood born but less cool. But he kills the beasts. He's seven. He's
00:46:41 at least a seven. I like him. I'll give him some points because all the universal monsters
00:46:46 suck so he's getting rid of them. So. Okay. Listen to this. For some reason the next one
00:46:51 on this list is Henry Frankenstein. Oh that must be the guy. That's the guy who made Frankenstein.
00:46:56 Yeah I told you he's a monster. He's terrible. But what the fuck. I click on the link and
00:46:59 now it's Victor Frankenstein. That's the whole point of the book is that he's the real monster
00:47:03 and the monster is more human. But why does he say Henry here and Victor on the other
00:47:07 page. I don't understand. Okay this must be out of date. Okay Victor Frankenstein. Fuck
00:47:12 it. The guy who made it. Now that guy's cool. He gets an eight. Is he such a bad guy. He
00:47:16 just wanted to do science. No no he's terrible. He just wanted to be God. How bad can he be.
00:47:22 He didn't do nothing. I will not approve the slanderization of Victor Frankenstein. He's
00:47:29 a wonderful camera operator. He went to college for the shit. He knows what he's fucking doing.
00:47:34 He can make better quality videos than we ever fucking could. He's gonna have his slanderization
00:47:38 Victor Frankenstein. I hate it. That's a very rude thing and I hope Mage when he is our
00:47:43 cameraman at RideCon3 you'll be a little nicer about what he's doing for us. Not that Victor.
00:47:49 It's too late. We understand what you meant. Next vote up. The invisible man. The invisible
00:47:54 man. I like that one. I'm gonna give him an eight. I really like him. I like the fact
00:47:57 that he's like kind of a mummy but like he's also invisible. There's like two things there.
00:48:02 I saw the movie. I'm gonna give him like four. He fucking sucks dick. Oh but really you suck dick.
00:48:10 Have you ever thought that what you say about people actually reflects upon you as a person?
00:48:14 He's only gay so he can sneak into men's locker rooms and literally suck dick. That's his whole end
00:48:19 game and so I give him like an eight out of ten. He does deserve points for that. Exactly. I respect
00:48:26 his gumption. I was gonna argue with you Nick but I googled the invisible man and I can't deny
00:48:32 what he's wearing and his bi-language indicates that he is in fact the most homosexual person
00:48:36 I've ever seen in my life. There's nothing to argue against. He just clearly is the gayest fucking guy
00:48:42 ever. That's correct. That's correct. Hold on. Look at this fucking photo of the
00:48:51 the original faggot. Oh man. He's looking fab. He's looking fab. Oh that's spectacular. I kind of
00:48:58 like it actually. He looks cool. He looks fucking dope. I was that cool. He's fucking dope as hell.
00:49:05 He sucks so much dick I can't help but respect him. Same. Same. Okay next on the list for some
00:49:12 reason is Elizabeth which is Victor Frankenstein's fiance. Does anyone know anything about this
00:49:17 character? Ten because it's a woman. The scariest monster. Yeah. Tips. Oh there you go. She's a name.
00:49:24 There you go. She has a name. You know what skip. I don't give a shit about her. Okay last on the
00:49:29 list of actual people is Igor. Igor the freakish. Igor's good. Hunchbacked. Ten out of ten. He was
00:49:36 just a real boy trying to make a living. That's right. You see the thing that's great about Igor
00:49:40 is that he looks like a monster on the outside because he's so weird and goofy and silly and
00:49:44 hilarious but on the inside he's just the greatest person, nicest boy who ever lived. Fucking
00:49:49 thumbs up if you've seen the greatest movie of all time Igor 2008. If not but it looks fucking
00:49:56 incredible. It's fucking dope. Igor 2008 is my fucking jam. Igor is played by John Kuzak.
00:50:04 It's the universal constant. It's fun and clever. Exactly. Wow. Wow. I'm just not pronounced Igor
00:50:12 and was sponsored by Apple to promote their new line of iPods that were coming out at the time.
00:50:17 The new deep web service Igor. Yes. Oh no. This may fucking 30 million point seven dollars at the
00:50:27 box office. He's powers before Igor. What the fuck. Powers before him. Cryptocurrency tanked when
00:50:36 this movie came out because real monster currency soared after Igor dropped and everyone. Igor
00:50:42 feel this right now. We want you on the podcast of all time killed cryptocurrency the US dollar
00:50:48 the scariest monster to ever live. That's true. That's true. Look how fucking look how fucking
00:50:53 co co co kawaii Igor is in this fucking movie. Hold on. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Those kawaii fucking
00:51:01 adorable. I love it. He's like an aunt. He looks like something from a bug's life. I feel
00:51:06 probably dream works animate or something fucking Igor. If you listen to the podcast we want you
00:51:09 on dude. We want you on this shit. We need we need you. We need you're wrong. We got one last
00:51:15 prowess. We got one last person here and it is mummy the mummy. What do we think of the
00:51:20 10 out of 10. He's my favorite 10 but I honestly I think that the invisible man wears the bandage
00:51:25 is better and like so mummies mummies don't have organs and somehow still are able to function
00:51:32 which means yeah what the fuck. It doesn't look real. I was that was a fucking slut.
00:51:42 Also I was going to say the fucking mummy the movie with Brendan Frazier was fucking sick because
00:51:47 that guy like fuck bitches and he like summoned like if we if we just guys if we have money on
00:51:53 this list why don't we have zombies on this list because well it's not a universal monster.
00:51:57 Yeah that's true. There are new things but zombies are fair. Zombies are fucking cool.
00:52:02 Before I'll just be that guy. I don't get I don't get the appeal of the mummy. I feel like the
00:52:07 appeal of the mummy is just the appeal of like ancient Egyptian stuff but like when I think of
00:52:13 a mummy there's nothing particularly Egyptian about it except it's just a zombie. It's just a
00:52:18 fucking did it. Yeah it's it's aesthetic which is not which is not true in reality but but in
00:52:24 but in movie land is the only place that actually matters and then listen listen the real okay there
00:52:29 is a there is a secret monster that came out in in the wake of the mummy and it is the realest
00:52:33 most terrifying monster that's ever existed so everyone's familiar with the saga of Brendan Frazier
00:52:38 I'm sure who has fallen from grace in the most tragic way possible and at the height of his
00:52:43 popularity he got a divorce and now he has to pay these like $500,000 alimony payments to his wife
00:52:50 and he is not getting into rules because no one wants to hire him because he got too tight cast
00:52:54 and exploded he burned out too too hotly and too quickly at the height of his career and he's
00:53:00 starting to get a little bit of shit now but like he's totally fucking dead and the real monster
00:53:04 here is alimony. Yeah alimony is the ultimate monster it ruins great men who could have otherwise
00:53:09 made something of themselves it is a beast like Brendan Frazier everyone's favorite alimony is just a
00:53:13 weapon the ultimate monster women yeah you know you're not wrong you're not wrong kill them all
00:53:18 that's that's my stance remember kids if you're gonna get married get a pc prenup get a pc

00:55:47 billion eyes on them that's like yeah and they're all like flaming and shit you know i was i was
00:55:53 skeptical but but i googled original angels and you know what you're right these are the scariest
00:55:57 things i've ever seen in my life i'm trembling like right now listen listen guys disgusting the popular
00:56:05 versions of of angels that people are familiar today that are just like pretty people with wings
00:56:09 that were like made famous during like you know the the i don't even know like greek in times here
00:56:13 when people are making you know whatever the fucking popes were painting them and shit the
00:56:16 fucking vistas sistine chapel and all that that's not the real shit in the bible we were talking
00:56:20 about angels from evan galleon because we're that fucking weebs oh those are pretty sick too i like
00:56:25 those i like the design my favorite is the uh what it's an octahedron the octahedron i forget
00:56:30 which name it's ramblethal or something whatever one it is that's the best character from guilty
00:56:34 gear also i think that might be the same name i gotta google that uh but yeah she's a sick monster
00:56:39 too she's got she's got that brown skin like a monster and just she's she's a perfect tan goddess
00:56:44 with white hair with big old shark teeth that will literally bite your dick off it's awesome i can't
00:56:49 find any images of of original angels i don't know what we're looking at oh oh um here i'll show you
00:56:55 i'll show you wait what what i i tried i tried searching for ophanim and it automatically
00:57:05 completed to ophanim on the digimon form digimon better than pokemon oh by the way the octahedron
00:57:13 in evan galleon is called rambiel rambiel i was mistaken uh there's just too many there's just too
00:57:20 many fucking good ones just google it people just google it it's incredible i tried it wouldn't

00:57:45 these these things are in addition to being awesome they are like the wheels of god's chariot
00:57:51 like is this like straight up biblical yeah please describe this for our list call please
00:57:55 describe it i think um but the okay the thing about it the thing about it like the reason why
00:58:02 angels are always depicted as like people with wings is because like in the bible angels appear
00:58:06 in the form of people right right isn't jacob that like wrestles an angel or something i don't know
00:58:13 someone wrestles an angel and and that angel is a guy but like that's not what he really looks like
00:58:18 he's appearing as a human but like in in the bible they appear they generally appear as humans but
00:58:23 that's not what they really look like uh this is what they really look like and they're fucking here
00:58:28 i'll find another one i'll find a seraphim and just describe this like at least cherub's cherub's
00:58:33 i think used to have like you know how cherub's are depicted as like little babies or not but
00:58:39 that that's not how they used to be i think they had three heads one human one lion one
00:58:44 bull or something yeah yeah they were like um they were like why do we make the bible so uncool
00:58:48 manticore i don't know man they were like it's because they baby did up i don't know this fucking
00:58:53 been advertising christianity in the bible has really made me thirsty to hunker down with the
00:58:58 with the good book one of these days he's thinking it sounds so so fucking you know advertise it's
00:59:03 if you know the boring parts it is yeah i've been wanting to take that the quest i've really owed
00:59:08 it to myself to actually read the thing oh is this like the thousand wings or whatever that's the
00:59:12 seraphim i love seraphim oh my god wait let me find the metatron my favorite guys guys you gotta
00:59:17 describe these because the people listening did not know what the fuck you're they're in the show

00:59:25 look it's a bunch of wings arranged around a central eye like that's all you have to say
00:59:31 they don't know what we're talking about they can't match images to what we're fucking speaking of
00:59:35 god well you just described it now google seraphim and find an image that matches your description
00:59:41 that is the worst idea i've ever heard in my life this is like furry porn i know

01:01:19 the hot take from the audience comes in so you can play both sides to your right you know he's
01:01:24 right about that uh but on fathers they are the most powerful creatures in our lives for sure
01:01:30 and they have the most ability to destroy us at their work they represent our most primal fears

01:02:35 the more of a request it is define meme define meme is it just meme is a joke that isn't funny
01:02:44 right that's your definition it's a viral joke that isn't funny i i i've led i've led this crusade
01:02:52 on arm retrieval the the the bible the bible retold for the for the modern era where we need to
01:02:57 make a distinction when we think things are funny refer to them as jokes and we think things
01:03:01 aren't funny refer to them as memes that that that's my that's my official doctrine and i
01:03:06 train from that whenever i can if there's one thing to discuss to me about the word meme it's
01:03:11 when it's used to mean like a still image of some quote unquote funny thing happening with text on
01:03:18 the top and bottom yeah that is a meme now that i hate that but like that's kind of what it
01:03:25 me people mean when they say it now like i don't i don't think i don't i think that i think we've
01:03:29 lost that battle yeah you're right yeah it's a shame i do it's not we've lost that that's what a
01:03:37 question from the discord chat western dragons versus who's it from ends western dragons
01:03:45 versus eastern dragons which are better i say western dragons eastern dragons western dragons
01:03:50 are fucking awful and i hate them so so so much they're cool lizards with with giant wings and the
01:03:56 brief fire and eastern dragons are just long noodles if i see western dragons for the win
01:04:02 if i see a single other castle night brown earth or dragon i will fucking buy off the handle
01:04:13 western fantasy it are the dregs of all fictional settings western fantasy is the opposite of
01:04:20 creativity and the graveyard for all potentially good ideas listen i when i was young i definitely
01:04:25 felt burned i read a lot of fantasy novels as a kid i definitely got burned out on like western
01:04:29 fantasy it's specifically like western dragons but then i got more into d&d which now i don't
01:04:35 really like so much but the point is i read the monsters manual and i read like all the books
01:04:40 and the like i would say that on average eastern dragons are just like they're cooler by default
01:04:46 but when you've got a really like majestic and like dignified looking like sick ass ancient
01:04:52 worm elder like gold or red or white dragon or something and they're just like so fucking wise
01:04:58 and so woke to the world they are so aesthetic and sick and i love them i think that they're awesome

01:13:12 answer probably uh happy d from the patreon lounge thoughts on monster any or energy drinks um oh
01:13:20 disgusting excellent monster like diesel i used to be a huge fan believe it or not back in the
01:13:27 college days but i graduated to red bull and rock star and haven't looked back the no sugar kind of
01:13:34 the monster ultra series is my favorite of all hey in case you guys haven't seen ben here is
01:13:40 quite the connoisseur of monster energy drinks having just made an art piece using the cans right
01:13:46 that was monster right um the big old yeah i made volpix for jackie out of like 50 fucking monster
01:13:52 cans meticulously cut monster cans into one yeah it is into one inch pieces of metal and then like
01:13:58 linked together with a hole punch and tiny metal key rings how did you keep that a secret
01:14:04 how did you keep that a secret that's what i'm wondering well see because like i started working
01:14:09 on it a long time ago like i started working on it like almost a year ago okay but it kind of like
01:14:14 it kind of like lost momentum but then our anniversary came up and i was like this i think
01:14:18 this is the time to finish it yeah okay so i did i pushed through because like i already i mean i'd
01:14:23 already put i'd already put all that work in like i had to do it was like now's the time if i'm ever
01:14:28 gonna baggy and like pop artness at the same time i love it i love it made of fucking monster
01:14:33 cans it's oh that's great it's it's it's really it's something that uh i don't know i mean i'd
01:14:40 i'd want it in my house you probably have to like map out like pixel by pixel like i absolutely did
01:14:45 i have like i have like files um yeah i had to like i had to like divide the original sprite
01:14:51 into its pixels find out how many of each color i needed how and then like estimate how many cans
01:14:57 that was going to be uh separate them all and then like i took the thing and i split it into
01:15:02 its vertical sections and then i would link together one vertical section at a time um and
01:15:07 then i would connect them by the top and then i i yeah um it was it was labor and and energy
01:15:13 intensive it sure looks like it well okay you know there's one last question we have to answer
