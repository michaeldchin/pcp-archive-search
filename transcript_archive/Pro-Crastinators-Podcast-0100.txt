00:00:45 Okay, alright, I'm the best guy ever. Today we have with us Hippocrite. Hello!
00:00:53 Why don't you wear his tiny hat?
00:00:54 It's me! You better fucking believe this is the most exciting podcast you've ever seen in your fucking life!
00:01:00 Have your ass glow to that fucking scene!
00:01:03 I blew out my voice with this shit and you're gonna fill the full brute force of my fucking spiritual cock up your ass pretty soon, bitch!
00:01:15 We've got Digi, bro!
00:01:17 Hey, it's me! It's the one! You know the one! He's the Bippity Boppity with the Flippity Flappity!
00:01:24 And, uh, Tom's next to me.
00:01:26 Tom Oliver, everybody!
00:01:28 I don't even know what to say in response to that. What's a Flippity Flappity?
00:01:31 I'm getting bad images from that, too.
00:01:33 You know what's a Flippity Flappity?
00:01:34 Yeah, we've got some ideas. Mr. Ben Saint!
00:01:37 Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
00:01:42 Woohoo!
00:01:44 Woo! What a rush!
00:01:45 And let's have a shout out to our cameraman, Victoire, behind the cameraman. Yeah!
00:01:50 There he is!
00:01:51 Yeah!
00:01:53 Woo!
00:01:55 The layers! The layers!
00:01:57 The layers.
00:01:59 Alright, today's episode, everybody, is a very special episode.
00:02:03 Ben is not in shot.
00:02:05 Hey, help! Help!
00:02:07 Today's episode of the Progressives Podcast.
00:02:09 Friendship!
00:02:11 Friendship!
00:02:12 Okay, Urban Dictionary.
00:02:14 No!
00:02:15 Who's got a working phone, because my phone is not working.
00:02:17 We're going to urbandictionary.com.
00:02:20 Give me everyone one of your phones.
00:02:22 We wrecked the internet before.
00:02:24 We have had, I apologize to everyone who's been waiting.
00:02:26 We've had some technical difficulties.
00:02:28 Oh, and by the way, that's a good chance to say,
00:02:30 if you're thinking of super chatting, feel free to do so,
00:02:33 and we encourage you to wait until the end,
00:02:35 because we're not reading, we're not distracting ourselves,
00:02:37 any of that pedantic fan bullshit.
00:02:39 I got it first.
00:02:41 Until the end of the episode,
00:02:43 when we get to the questions section,
00:02:45 we will be looking at all the super chats we've gotten,
00:02:47 and feel free to send them then,
00:02:49 and we will look at them, and we will evaluate them as we do normally,
00:02:51 because as we all know, your questions are usually trash,
00:02:53 and we don't want to waste everyone's time interrupting the podcast every second.
00:02:57 Don't expect us to reach out at all during this.
00:02:59 Yeah, we're not reading chat at all.
00:03:01 Enjoy that. We'll get back to you at the question time.
00:03:04 What do we got for friendship?
00:03:06 True friendship is not when you go to school,
00:03:08 and hang around with someone,
00:03:10 just because you have no one else to chill with.
00:03:12 It's not calling someone up when you're bored,
00:03:14 because they are fun to talk to.
00:03:16 It's not when you can't think of a birthday gift,
00:03:18 and end up buying your friend a Walmart gift card.
00:03:20 It's not when you have to talk to someone about something.
00:03:22 Oh my, this actually goes on for paragraphs.
00:03:24 True friendship is a group piss.
00:03:27 Yes, absolutely.
00:03:30 Group piss!
00:03:33 We just pulled out our cocks just a few moments ago,
00:03:36 and the yellow snow was as fucking vast as space itself.
00:03:40 And not one of us looked.
00:03:42 And I believe that,
00:03:44 because I wasn't looking or anything to see.
00:03:47 Trust me.
00:03:49 Give me the zoom, dawg.
00:03:51 They can just see the group piss right here.
00:03:53 Oh yeah, there it is.
00:03:55 Group piss!
00:03:57 Look how iconic.
00:03:59 Look how iconic that is.
00:04:01 That's like a fucking Adderwood cover right there.
00:04:03 No, is that not the new banner for the PCP?
00:04:05 Oh yeah!
00:04:07 We just go shot a boomage in there.
00:04:09 That's a good idea.
00:04:11 That actually would be an amazing banner for the PCP.
00:04:15 It would be.
00:04:17 Nate, what are we talking about?
00:04:19 We're just going to talk about friendship.
00:04:21 Have you ever even had a friend?
00:04:23 What are your experiences?
00:04:25 What friendship is.
00:04:27 And first of all, how it's not real.
00:04:29 It doesn't exist.
00:04:31 As most people use it.
00:04:33 Okay, all right. Here's the real thing.
00:04:35 Let's get started.
00:04:37 It's already something.
00:04:39 Please edit in the entirety of the weird
00:04:41 utilitarian podcast right now.
00:04:43 Cut the episode.
00:04:45 Good night, everybody.
00:04:47 We got ahead of five minutes. It's gone.
00:04:49 Okay, here's the thing.
00:04:51 Here's where I want to start with a concept of friendship.
00:04:53 I care about you all and I enjoy working with you.
00:04:55 But here's the thing. If you fucking betray me,
00:04:57 I will drop you with the drop of a hat.
00:04:59 At any moment, you could do it.
00:05:01 And I will drop you without a moment's
00:05:03 hesitation.
00:05:05 So the point I'm getting at here is how
00:05:07 this is kind of ties in with love.
00:05:09 Because love and friendship are pretty related.
00:05:11 Unconditional love, unconditional friendship
00:05:13 is highly immoral.
00:05:15 And I don't think anyone should ever do it.
00:05:17 And that's my foundational principle
00:05:19 when I'm approaching this.
00:05:21 I don't understand why it's immoral.
00:05:23 I understand why maybe it doesn't make
00:05:25 sense.
00:05:27 No, it is immoral because it encourages bad behavior.
00:05:29 And if you have the wisdom to recognize
00:05:31 that you can avoid doing that,
00:05:33 then you should do it. If you're just ignorant
00:05:35 and you don't realize you're doing something wrong,
00:05:37 then that's not immoral.
00:05:39 True Friends is putting up with this.
00:05:41 No.
00:05:43 Alright.
00:05:45 We'll get into all this.
00:05:47 If you keep applying friendship,
00:05:49 there's no connection.
00:05:51 But friendship isn't about that.
00:05:53 Friendship is that spicy look you get in your eyes
00:05:55 whenever you look at the male form
00:05:57 and you just know it's not getting sweaty
00:05:59 and starting to heat up.
00:06:01 And you know, whenever I look at your
00:06:03 eyes, hold on.
00:06:05 Whenever I look at guys,
00:06:07 shift away, I'm thinking about something else.
00:06:09 Yeah.
00:06:11 Nate, friendship is real.
00:06:13 You started off saying it wasn't real.
00:06:15 That was his real.
00:06:17 That was his look.
00:06:19 It's not real like tables and chairs are real,
00:06:21 but it's real like, I don't know,
00:06:23 the law is real.
00:06:25 That's true.
00:06:27 Sort of.
00:06:29 It's real in the way that like,
00:06:31 math is real.
00:06:33 We all pretend that we have our own benefit.
00:06:35 Yeah, friendship is real like math is real.
00:06:37 Because we all agree on it.
00:06:39 Friendship is real like magic is real.
00:06:41 I mean, all fucking know magic is real.
00:06:43 No one's debating that.
00:06:45 We were talking about this before.
00:06:47 I want to share everyone.
00:06:49 I decided
00:06:51 relevant to this story.
00:06:53 I think it's a story that you all will enjoy immensely.
00:06:55 I was telling everyone in the car.
00:06:57 It's kind of personal.
00:06:59 But I've chosen to share
00:07:01 because I think it's mostly making fun of me.
00:07:03 So hopefully you'll all appreciate it.
00:07:05 Shrap fucking in for this.
00:07:07 This is unreal.
00:07:09 This is no peak weird utilitarianism.
00:07:11 I apologize to everyone already.
00:07:13 Everyone involved.
00:07:15 So,
00:07:17 I have a girlfriend now.
00:07:19 And that's pretty cool.
00:07:21 Nate's always bringing up his girlfriend in the fucking car.
00:07:23 Sorry.
00:07:25 Here's the thing though.
00:07:27 So the issue of
00:07:29 love
00:07:31 eventually came up.
00:07:33 As it tends to do.
00:07:35 Love came up.
00:07:37 And what happened was
00:07:39 when the first thing I
00:07:41 looked at the table,
00:07:43 there was questions of like,
00:07:45 how come you haven't said I love you
00:07:47 and stuff.
00:07:49 I had to be honest and be truthful
00:07:51 and say, listen, here's the thing.
00:07:53 I don't believe love exists.
00:07:55 That's where I'm coming at.
00:07:57 This is so uncomfortable.
00:07:59 I know.
00:08:01 I apologize.
00:08:03 Chemicals in your brain.
00:08:05 Here's the thing.
00:08:07 We had to define the term love
00:08:09 before I was comfortable saying that I love you.
00:08:11 We had to define the word.
00:08:13 We had to define our terms.
00:08:15 Which I think is how you should have
00:08:17 conducted every relationship with everyone.
00:08:19 And your definition is what everyone would consider love to be.
00:08:21 I know.
00:08:23 But it was really important to me that we established that word.
00:08:25 Clearly had to happen as Nate had to sit down
00:08:27 with his girlfriend and be like, okay,
00:08:29 we need to establish her so let's go to
00:08:31 urbandictionary.com.
00:08:35 Look, look.
00:08:37 This is just the thing.
00:08:39 I had to establish what love was
00:08:41 and what I was willing to say because
00:08:43 like I said before,
00:08:45 I don't want people to think when I say that I love them
00:08:47 that I love them unconditionally.
00:08:49 That's really important because even if my fucking son one day
00:08:51 is gay,
00:08:53 he'll be out of it.
00:08:55 Music is a lot like love.
00:08:57 It's all a feeling.
00:08:59 And it fills the room from the floor of the ceiling.
00:09:01 That's what I think about.
00:09:03 We all understand this.
00:09:05 I took some magic clowns to tell us.
00:09:07 Friendship is real a lot like how magics are
00:09:09 a lot like how magnets are real
00:09:11 and mostly aren't.
00:09:13 Scientists tell us they are.
00:09:15 I haven't had a serious girlfriend in quite a while
00:09:17 and I wanted to be quite clear
00:09:19 because I believe it is the most
00:09:21 moral way to live.
00:09:23 You know that picture somebody tweeted of like
00:09:25 the robot body with the human head that said like
00:09:27 this is peak the utilitarian body.
00:09:29 Sorry ladies, this is what peak ethics looks like.
00:09:31 That's kind of how I feel about like my moral system.
00:09:33 I wanted to be clear
00:09:35 that when I say
00:09:37 what I mean is
00:09:39 what I mean is that
00:09:41 I enjoy your company immensely.
00:09:43 I want to share my life with you.
00:09:45 I want to live together.
00:09:47 That's just what it is.
00:09:49 No, but I wanted to be clear
00:09:51 that what I'm not saying is if you betray me
00:09:53 that I will stay by you.
00:09:55 If you betray me.
00:09:57 You're nate.
00:09:59 I say the word
00:10:01 I want to make sure that it's clear
00:10:03 that I'm talking about a bumblebee that is
00:10:05 yellow and black.
00:10:07 I think one of the major problems
00:10:09 of this day and age is that people
00:10:11 are using the same words but talking about
00:10:13 different things.
00:10:15 I agree with that.
00:10:17 That's a different subject, but I agree.
00:10:19 I honestly think it's, I believe
00:10:21 that what you did there was a good idea
00:10:23 and I think I would have done the same
00:10:25 if I had doubts about the like
00:10:27 you know if I had thought there was a possibility
00:10:29 nate confirmed to doubting that this is a very
00:10:31 stupid girlfriend.
00:10:33 If I wasn't sure that we thought
00:10:35 that it meant the same thing, you know
00:10:37 I didn't like
00:10:39 ask but I had the sense
00:10:41 before I was willing to
00:10:43 I had a sense that it was
00:10:45 the same understanding before I was
00:10:47 like you know, Michelle would just walk home
00:10:49 and she was like, yeah, yeah, I love
00:10:51 getting unnecessary work and getting
00:10:53 shit on by my boss and I love knocking the promotion
00:10:55 that I was promised. I sure love that
00:10:57 and you're like, oh, maybe she thinks love is something else.
00:10:59 Maybe she doesn't know that love is a good
00:11:01 feeling. Well, like
00:11:03 some of us have
00:11:05 really hardcore autism and we
00:11:07 need these things.
00:11:09 Some of us?
00:11:11 It's a hundredth episode.
00:11:13 It doesn't do to be talking with
00:11:15 words that like people disagree
00:11:17 on the definitions. So I'm giving you
00:11:19 shit.
00:11:21 In principle, I'm okay with like, okay, well
00:11:23 let's settle what we're talking about.
00:11:25 Love is honestly my least favorite word
00:11:27 in the world because love is the most
00:11:29 loaded word.
00:11:31 Aside from God, love
00:11:33 can mean literally anything.
00:11:35 And friendship
00:11:37 is similar. Friendship is similar. When some people
00:11:39 say they're friends, they mean one thing.
00:11:41 When other people say they're friends, it's totally different.
00:11:43 What are you saying, Gib? Nothing. Nothing about
00:11:45 what? About what? I just said
00:11:47 my little pony friendship is similar.
00:11:49 I didn't
00:11:51 absorb the lessons from my little pony friendship
00:11:53 was magic well enough. So I need to go to
00:11:55 UrbanDictionary.com
00:11:57 We've already extrapolated friendship
00:11:59 to love and gone to the
00:12:01 origin point of is love
00:12:03 real or not.
00:12:05 We've already been
00:12:07 an awkward fly on the wall.
00:12:09 But here's the thing though.
00:12:11 As
00:12:13 is defined by
00:12:15 our
00:12:17 explanation of the definition of the word
00:12:19 love, I love all of you guys.
00:12:21 But that's the thing.
00:12:23 There you go.
00:12:25 That's how it is. Love only means what it means
00:12:27 in my head that I have not explained to you.
00:12:29 Don't you fucking get it, Nate? That's the problem
00:12:31 with words inherently. Everyone has their own
00:12:33 definition of words that exist just in your head
00:12:35 and hopefully it's the same as everybody else's
00:12:37 but we can't guarantee that. She's on his fucking
00:12:39 phone. Just fucking read the chat
00:12:41 and Michelle is in there losing her shit.
00:12:43 Oh no!
00:12:45 Is she mad? Is she mad at me?
00:12:47 No, she's just incredulous and screaming
00:12:49 for the help.
00:12:51 Michelle, I'm sorry.
00:12:53 We're not reading chat.
00:12:55 I just wanted to make sure we're not fucking anything up.
00:12:57 I was actually going to ask you to check.
00:12:59 If things start dying, I want to know.
00:13:01 I also wanted to encourage people to like the camera setup
00:13:03 I'm sure they're loving it.
00:13:05 Let's pull this back. No one wants to hear about
00:13:07 your fucking gay awful bullshit anymore.
00:13:09 We've already done an entire episode on it.
00:13:11 We can tuck your ideas
00:13:13 into the shallow grave they deserve.
00:13:15 We can tuck our ideas into the
00:13:17 between our asshole and pussy.
00:13:19 And to our both asshole and pussy.
00:13:21 Yeah, that's right.
00:13:23 Alright, friends.
00:13:25 How would you say
00:13:27 friends?
00:13:29 Friendship is what we mean
00:13:31 when we say what anime
00:13:33 is about.
00:13:35 Let me just fucking give us an actual conversation time.
00:13:37 Please God. Everybody,
00:13:39 how important would you say that
00:13:41 friends are to your life?
00:13:43 Like, how much of your time
00:13:45 goes to friends? How much of your thoughts go to friends?
00:13:47 Well, how important
00:13:49 this is a distinction.
00:13:51 How important or how much do they take up?
00:13:53 Both of those facts.
00:13:55 The important level is like
00:13:57 8, but usage is like
00:13:59 6.
00:14:01 So friends don't take up as much
00:14:03 of your time as how much you've been thinking about them?
00:14:05 Well, no, that's not what I mean.
00:14:07 Thinking about them
00:14:09 I put that into the 6th category.
00:14:11 How important are they
00:14:13 because how much I like friends
00:14:15 and how much I like the concept of friends
00:14:17 and how much I want to be near friends
00:14:19 but I don't really think about
00:14:21 what's been doing.
00:14:23 I really feel like
00:14:25 human existence
00:14:27 is like you do things to survive
00:14:29 and then when you're surviving
00:14:31 there's not so much
00:14:33 we're social animals
00:14:35 so social
00:14:37 relationships with people
00:14:39 either a significant other
00:14:41 or people who you just want to spend
00:14:43 a time with, which could also be
00:14:45 a significant other, but sometimes it isn't.
00:14:47 Are you making a distinction there between the two?
00:14:49 Well, one of them you fuck and the others are just friends.
00:14:51 Yeah, yeah.
00:14:53 But you can be friends with a significant other as well.
00:14:55 And let's do this back.
00:14:57 We are social animals.
00:14:59 None of us are like Nate, we all feel love
00:15:01 and friendship.
00:15:03 You guys are just too cowardly
00:15:05 to understand that none of that shit's right.
00:15:07 Yeah, that's right.
00:15:09 That's what I'm saying.
00:15:11 Listen, I've watched
00:15:13 a lot of Rick and Morty.
00:15:15 I'm fully blacked out.
00:15:17 On the words though.
00:15:19 We agree with you, it's just we don't care
00:15:21 talking about it into such detail.
00:15:23 But detail is important.
00:15:25 I think what Hippo is sort of touching on
00:15:27 is that there are a lot of people who
00:15:29 like... Give me a frame!
00:15:31 Help!
00:15:33 There he is.
00:15:35 When you made a distinction between
00:15:37 a significant other.
00:15:39 Some people
00:15:41 feel...
00:15:43 A lot of people just want to fuck
00:15:45 and so they find a significant other
00:15:47 less based on whether they are good friends
00:15:49 and more based on whether they are good fuck.
00:15:51 You gotta put up with them
00:15:53 so you can get that.
00:15:55 And other people have people they like to fuck
00:15:57 who are also their friends.
00:15:59 I understand the distinction between
00:16:01 someone who you're not having sex with
00:16:03 that means it's much harder to put up with them.
00:16:05 I feel pretty passionately about the connection
00:16:07 you have.
00:16:09 This is where it comes
00:16:11 from the whole thing of
00:16:13 bros before a hose for example
00:16:15 is a pretty...
00:16:17 And bros is gender neutral
00:16:19 and bros is gender neutral.
00:16:21 That is true. I generally feel that
00:16:23 just out in the world
00:16:25 there's a feeling that love between
00:16:27 guys is sort of a... it's purer
00:16:29 than the love between a man and a woman.
00:16:31 Because men are more complete.
00:16:33 No, that's not what I'm saying.
00:16:35 When a man is interested in a woman
00:16:37 99.9
00:16:39 basically 100% of the time
00:16:41 he wants to fuck her.
00:16:43 I've told her all this in detail.
00:16:45 Imagine all the lectures I do on this
00:16:47 I give to her nightly as she tries to sleep
00:16:49 so she can.
00:16:51 She said in the chat that the conversation Nate was describing
00:16:53 was four hours long.
00:16:55 Oh my god.
00:16:57 That's right.
00:16:59 It was just a big circle.
00:17:01 It was a big circle.
00:17:03 Wait, if it was four hours long
00:17:05 your Kingdom Hearts discussion was five hours long.
00:17:07 Yeah.
00:17:09 No, it's true.
00:17:11 You're not wrong.
00:17:13 I was the only person who answered.
00:17:15 How much has been thinking about friends
00:17:17 and how much you give your life to friends?
00:17:19 How much do you have a bad romance?
00:17:21 Ooh.
00:17:23 Wait, you went woo
00:17:25 and I forgot the question.
00:17:27 Do you like your friends?
00:17:29 Yes.
00:17:31 When I was young, a teenager
00:17:33 I was like very socially awkward
00:17:35 and friendship was like scary.
00:17:37 And friendship was witchcraft.
00:17:39 Meeting new people and going from
00:17:41 primary school to secondary school
00:17:43 nobody came with me so I was like
00:17:45 a bunch of new people
00:17:47 and I'm a stupid idiot
00:17:49 so I didn't bother to try and make friendships
00:17:51 but later
00:17:53 it just
00:17:55 you come to a point where you realize
00:17:57 that you're much more important than
00:17:59 you would have otherwise thought
00:18:01 because you think in your head
00:18:03 oh, it's just
00:18:05 stupid high school politics
00:18:07 it's like
00:18:09 you have to be cool and you have to be this and that
00:18:11 and it's not about being popular
00:18:13 it's just about
00:18:15 having meaningful relationships
00:18:17 that fulfill you
00:18:19 and the reason I realized this
00:18:21 the moment this crystallized in my head
00:18:23 is when I was playing The Sims
00:18:25 I was dedicated to getting that guy
00:18:27 all the skills so that he could get the big jobs
00:18:29 and the career ups
00:18:31 but I couldn't be bothered to call people
00:18:33 on the phone and have parties and stuff
00:18:35 and he got so depressed he couldn't do anything
00:18:37 I was like oh god, oh it's too real
00:18:39 that's exactly the real life
00:18:41 So did you set it out in your life to make new friends
00:18:43 or something like that? I set it out in my life to be better than The Sims
00:18:45 Okay, excellent
00:18:47 By the way I just want to zoom out Victor
00:18:49 I just want to let everyone in the audience know
00:18:51 that all the people on this couch are doing episodes of the PCP
00:18:53 and everyone on that couch is looking at their phones
00:18:55 zoning out and also zoning out
00:18:57 even harder and doing nothing
00:18:59 You aren't supposed to be reading the chat!
00:19:01 If I don't read the chat
00:19:03 how will I know if the fucking stream is going okay?
00:19:05 Re-checking constantly
00:19:07 Re-checking is the reasonable thing to do
00:19:09 I resent the fact that you think I'm zoning out
00:19:11 I'm listening attentively
00:19:13 I heard that Lady Gaga reference
00:19:15 Get fucked
00:19:17 This is the age team
00:19:19 This is the age team
00:19:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah
00:19:23 You asked him a question
00:19:25 and we were giving him time
00:19:27 and also I set up this in a way that it would go around
00:19:29 all six of us one by one
00:19:31 to discuss these two
00:19:33 I'm not listening to any of this and you shouldn't either
00:19:35 Once again, Munchy James Johnson
00:19:37 is fake news
00:19:39 Okay, well, so Gib,
00:19:41 again, I guess what Munchy is asking
00:19:43 is how much do you depend on
00:19:45 and feel the need to work with your friends?
00:19:47 More than I used to
00:19:49 I feel like friendships are important
00:19:51 to continue to work on
00:19:53 as a thing you have to try and do
00:19:55 and hopefully they try and do it as well
00:19:57 and if they don't then it becomes
00:19:59 get better friends, I guess
00:20:01 Oh, go on
00:20:03 No, no, I was done
00:20:05 Relationships and of course friendship
00:20:07 because friendship and relationships are always work
00:20:09 and work is not a bad thing
00:20:11 that should be treated with any sort of
00:20:13 I have to check into my nine to five
00:20:15 work is just something that you put in time to
00:20:17 work in the sense like art work
00:20:19 more so than work work
00:20:21 I think it was in general
00:20:23 Productive work
00:20:25 I think there needs to be
00:20:27 invented another word
00:20:29 that means that, what you're saying
00:20:31 because work
00:20:33 is like production
00:20:35 there are people who will use it
00:20:37 to mean like my favorite thing to do
00:20:39 and people who use it to mean my least favorite
00:20:41 thing to do and those need to be two different words
00:20:43 because like creating art when I say
00:20:45 like oh I love working
00:20:47 I mean like I love working
00:20:49 on my art
00:20:51 but when I say fuck I hate working
00:20:53 I hate going to a job
00:20:55 You go the stuff you don't like work
00:20:57 and the stuff you do like funk
00:21:01 That's good
00:21:03 So anyway, friendship is
00:21:05 things that you need to work on continuously
00:21:07 to reap the rewards from them
00:21:09 if you leave them there then you will not reap rewards
00:21:11 and work can just be talking to them
00:21:13 or it can just be, this does not have to be
00:21:15 a daily thing but you have to put in work
00:21:17 to get benefit from any sort of relationship
00:21:19 whatsoever
00:21:20 That's generally true
00:21:21 and I guess to get to my answer to this question
00:21:23 Friendships
00:21:25 are important to me obviously
00:21:27 since I'm involved with the PCP so much
00:21:29 and stuff
00:21:31 You have to push your complex feelings and nebulous feelings
00:21:33 into a specific number from one to ten
00:21:35 Okay, I'll try to do that but I was just going to say that
00:21:37 on the other hand
00:21:39 I have noticed in myself
00:21:41 that every friend who is no longer useful to me
00:21:43 I have abandoned
00:21:45 That means you're not gaining reward back from your work
00:21:47 That's true
00:21:49 If I called up a friend from my hometown
00:21:51 they'd be willing to talk to me
00:21:53 and just chat them up
00:21:55 I don't talk to my old friends
00:21:57 from
00:21:59 previous places I've lived that much
00:22:01 and it's not because I don't like them
00:22:03 it's just because
00:22:05 we can talk once in a while and catch up
00:22:07 but we can't
00:22:09 we can't hang out anymore
00:22:11 That's true
00:22:13 The way I see it
00:22:15 Friends for the most part
00:22:17 are people who you want to do things with
00:22:19 and you can zoom in on me
00:22:21 I'm going to talk for a little bit
00:22:23 Oh, which is
00:22:25 like changing the universe over there
00:22:27 Try to increase the audio
00:22:29 I feel like
00:22:31 friends are people who you want to do stuff with
00:22:33 and who you would rather do things
00:22:35 with them than do it alone
00:22:37 I hate going
00:22:39 I hate like
00:22:41 Yeah, why not
00:22:43 It moves
00:22:45 Don't put that fucking cup there
00:22:47 It's gonna spill
00:22:49 You might fucking special stimulate tea
00:22:51 Yeah, don't shout out
00:22:55 That was so distracting
00:22:57 I forgot what I was like
00:22:59 Friends are people
00:23:01 I don't want to do this shit by myself
00:23:03 I'd rather do it with somebody
00:23:05 So let me call up my pals
00:23:07 and have them come over and shit
00:23:09 But then it has to be people who you want
00:23:11 to do the same things as them
00:23:13 and I think that inevitably if that falls apart
00:23:15 the friendship falls apart too
00:23:17 It's just like
00:23:19 I love all my friends from back home
00:23:21 They're all great people
00:23:23 They're all people who I respected
00:23:25 who I wanted to do things with
00:23:27 but eventually they all got into street fighter
00:23:29 and cars
00:23:31 The Disney property
00:23:33 Hell yeah, they were really into cars
00:23:35 Fucking Lightning McQueen beds
00:23:37 in every household
00:23:39 I had to hear so many fucking
00:23:41 truck impressors
00:23:43 What the hell is that guy's name? The Larry the Cable Guy truck?
00:23:45 The Major
00:23:47 Did they actually get into
00:23:49 Pixar's car?
00:23:51 Yeah, they fucking did
00:23:55 You should have seen it when Cars 3 came out dude
00:23:57 They were going fucking ballistic
00:23:59 You should have seen the line outside
00:24:01 Fucking planes promo night dude
00:24:03 Fucking boss in the first night
00:24:05 planes release bro
00:24:07 Anyway
00:24:09 So yeah because those guys
00:24:11 do those things
00:24:13 they would come over to my house every weekend
00:24:15 because everybody hung out in Victor's room for like
00:24:17 years and my friends would
00:24:19 all come over and they just sit there
00:24:21 and play street fighter all night and I would come down
00:24:23 and I'd be like hey what's up guys and I'm just like
00:24:25 oh yeah I don't like street fighter
00:24:27 and that much so I just go back
00:24:29 to my room and gradually that led to like
00:24:31 well once Victor moved away
00:24:33 like that wasn't the hangout spot
00:24:35 anymore and I literally have not seen most
00:24:37 of my friends since then except for
00:24:39 at a New Year's party
00:24:41 but like yeah it's like
00:24:43 it doesn't really matter that I like those people
00:24:45 if we're not going to do anything together
00:24:47 then there's just nothing
00:24:49 there's no like
00:24:51 I can still call them my friends
00:24:53 but I feel like friends has more of an active
00:24:55 role to me
00:24:57 Victor get over here with that fucking thing
00:24:59 this group itself
00:25:01 to me
00:25:03 what are you fucking doing
00:25:05 what's happening
00:25:07 you are the cameraman
00:25:13 zoom the fucking camera on me
00:25:15 alright tell you Victor
00:25:17 I appreciate your reference
00:25:23 love does not exist
00:25:25 love does not this group itself
00:25:27 would at least to some degree
00:25:29 definitely have drifted apart
00:25:31 if it were not for me saying guys
00:25:33 we need a podcast to hold us together
00:25:35 therefore the potty the purpose
00:25:37 of the procrastiners podcast
00:25:39 really unironically was to keep
00:25:41 this group together that is what it was
00:25:43 made for that was my original intention
00:25:45 because everyone's getting away from pony
00:25:47 no one was going to be doing the same thing
00:25:49 people were splitting up
00:25:51 people used to love MLP to keep us together
00:25:53 unironically
00:25:55 for sure
00:25:57 Ben stop joking around
00:25:59 I can't stop goofing
00:26:03 I can't stop screaming
00:26:05 but it's true I mean look at you right now
00:26:07 it's a stimulant T
00:26:09 stimulant T
00:26:11 stimulant T
00:26:13 stimulant T
00:26:15 stimulant T
00:26:17 look right now
00:26:19 this group itself is pretty
00:26:21 varied and red pilled of course
00:26:23 Ben is just a comic guy for the most part
00:26:25 he makes videos sometimes
00:26:27 but he's kind of doing something
00:26:29 he's a pokey tube
00:26:31 he's a pokey tube
00:26:33 it was a big mistake to choose pokey tube
00:26:35 for MLP
00:26:37 you know I don't know whatever
00:26:39 like Digi's hardcore anime stuff
00:26:41 I dabble in that and other stuff
00:26:43 Tom does his specific type of videos with the 3D stuff
00:26:45 and the tech reviews he was doing
00:26:47 much is like a draw guy who didn't really have a defined role
00:26:49 recently
00:26:51 the point is we all do different stuff
00:26:53 and the PCP was a uniting thing
00:26:55 that kept us friends
00:26:57 and of course we're in the same group chat
00:26:59 but we've already seen some of this
00:27:01 when people have more shit going on in their life
00:27:03 they'll show up in the chat less
00:27:05 it's perfectly natural
00:27:07 so to have something
00:27:09 if there's someone
00:27:11 PSA to everybody out there
00:27:13 if you want to stay friends with someone
00:27:15 and you're afraid of drifting apart
00:27:17 evil way
00:27:19 you need to fucking put in work
00:27:21 evil can work
00:27:23 evil is pretty good
00:27:25 but if you're trying to get married
00:27:27 because you're afraid of someone leaving you
00:27:29 and for only that reason
00:27:31 for example I would consider that an immoral thing to do
00:27:33 if you're trying to keep someone with you
00:27:35 and they're like hey man you're not treating me good enough
00:27:37 you're like oh how about we just get married
00:27:39 a guy who does that to a woman
00:27:41 because he's afraid of her abandoning him
00:27:43 I think it's being kind of immoral
00:27:45 I gotta give credit
00:27:47 both to Nate and Munchy
00:27:49 for the fact that you guys are
00:27:51 I can tell
00:27:53 because I've kind of disappeared
00:27:55 I don't mind melded with someone
00:27:57 he's been mining at night a lot
00:27:59 I'm always mining at night
00:28:01 you need to stop
00:28:03 PSA do not mine at night
00:28:05 do not
00:28:07 mine at night
00:28:09 I'm fucking telling you
00:28:11 you have to stop that shit for your own fucking good
00:28:13 like all your fucking bones
00:28:15 we're currently working on legislation
00:28:17 to allow us to come to your house
00:28:19 to inspect your graphics card
00:28:21 if you're mining cryptocurrency at night
00:28:23 or anything else in Minecraft I don't care
00:28:25 it's gotta be stopped
00:28:27 I'm gonna have to get creeper
00:28:29 on your fucking $5,000 graphics card
00:28:31 and blow that shit to smithereens
00:28:33 back to digit
00:28:35 don't mine at night
00:28:37 because of the fact that I'm kind of
00:28:39 just like mind melded
00:28:41 some kind of
00:28:43 what's it called in Rick and Morty
00:28:45 the fucking bird person
00:28:47 he's like an intense spirit bond
00:28:49 or something like that
00:28:51 I'm in one of those things
00:28:53 I don't really show up in the chat that much
00:28:55 because of the fact that most of the stuff
00:28:57 I used to talk to you guys about
00:28:59 I just talk to the person I have in person
00:29:01 which I prefer
00:29:03 in person interaction is always better
00:29:05 and if I can meet you guys in person
00:29:07 that's the way I'd prefer to just
00:29:09 you don't need to know what's up with me on a day to day basis
00:29:11 we'll meet every three months
00:29:13 and just talk about all of it
00:29:15 and do a bunch of fun shit
00:29:17 you've not really done that though
00:29:19 we have
00:29:21 I've met you
00:29:23 literally the two of you every couple of months
00:29:25 for like the last year
00:29:27 we have not talked about
00:29:29 what you've been doing
00:29:31 like only recently have I ever even heard
00:29:33 of some of the ideas you've done
00:29:35 oh you mean like creatively
00:29:37 all new
00:29:39 all the shit I've told you here is like brand new
00:29:41 I guess Munchy's making a point that he feels
00:29:43 it's a little bit less
00:29:45 he feels that there's a lot here
00:29:47 what I'm trying to say is that you guys
00:29:49 have been the ones trying to make sure
00:29:51 that I don't fall completely away
00:29:53 because I routinely get messages from Nate and Munchy
00:29:55 like just making sure I know
00:29:57 what the fuck is going on
00:29:59 because I wasn't a part of any of the planning
00:30:01 for Radcon 3
00:30:03 so I barely knew what was happening
00:30:05 kickstart jail everyone
00:30:07 when we were going to go to Boston
00:30:09 when we visited back in
00:30:11 the double date times 2 plus 1
00:30:13 yeah the double date times 2 plus 1
00:30:15 when that was going on
00:30:17 like that morning
00:30:19 it was Christmas morning when I was supposed to drive out
00:30:21 and it was like a huge snow storm
00:30:23 and I wasn't sure if I was like comfortable
00:30:25 driving six hours in it
00:30:27 and I was like I was not sure how much fun
00:30:29 we were actually going to have because I don't really know what we're doing
00:30:31 those guys might just want to be with their families
00:30:33 they might not really want to hang out more than a couple hours
00:30:35 and we're going to have to be there a whole weekend
00:30:37 so like but then I thought
00:30:39 well maybe Munchy will hang out with me the whole time
00:30:41 I'm sure that'll that had happened
00:30:43 and I don't know but I didn't know anything about Boston
00:30:45 never been there never seen it
00:30:47 I thought it was like I didn't know it was like a huge
00:30:49 fucking metropolis
00:30:51 everyone I tell Boston
00:30:53 to thinks it's like some like weird bum
00:30:55 fuck nowhere place
00:30:57 where it's literally like an insanely important
00:30:59 part of like human history
00:31:01 in my mind Boston
00:31:03 is like I expect it to be like
00:31:05 a cobblestone like London looking
00:31:07 kind of town
00:31:09 we got haven yeah
00:31:11 because it was because Boston got ancient
00:31:13 it's old as fuck so I just assumed
00:31:15 that it's not like we stopped
00:31:17 building it
00:31:19 you have to understand where I am from
00:31:21 we've been making stuff
00:31:23 you've got to understand that where I'm from in Virginia
00:31:25 we literally have like preserved
00:31:27 the old colonies that were
00:31:29 built when we first came
00:31:31 and they're still like that
00:31:33 so I go places like that
00:31:35 like the place I went to college
00:31:37 is like a town that was like 200 years old
00:31:39 and like it just looks
00:31:41 old and cobblestone even though like
00:31:43 obviously people still live there
00:31:45 it's still like a functioning city
00:31:47 so I just kind of imagined Boston that way
00:31:49 but then I got a text
00:31:51 I guess he's the hardest selling title
00:31:53 like that morning before leaving
00:31:55 I got a text from Nate that was just like
00:31:57 Nate did you really looking forward to seeing you
00:31:59 in Boston and I was like well we got to go now
00:32:01 listen to this
00:32:03 listen to this baby boy
00:32:05 he wants to see me
00:32:07 yeah
00:32:09 I wanted to touch that face there you go
00:32:11 oh god
00:32:13 you have no idea where that tongue has been
00:32:15 oh god
00:32:17 I have no idea where that hand has been
00:32:19 he's tasting his own tongue
00:32:21 okay but anyway
00:32:23 the point of this is you have to
00:32:25 be able to talk to your friends
00:32:27 and just that smallest amount of encouragement
00:32:29 wasn't enough to fucking get him
00:32:31 up to Boston
00:32:33 and that's completely changed all of our fucking lives
00:32:35 you know right and the snow just happened
00:32:37 to stop right at that moment
00:32:39 so it was like oh the snow stopped
00:32:41 and Nate wants me to go
00:32:43 and it's only 12 so we still have time
00:32:45 or whatever we can make it
00:32:47 and then we did it
00:32:49 and it was great and now we all want to live there
00:32:51 you know a lot of this to me seems to come back
00:32:53 to a fundamental principle about how I live my life
00:32:55 that I talk about a lot
00:32:57 my content shit and it's that I take
00:32:59 complete responsibility for everything
00:33:01 that I have in my life and the things that I want
00:33:03 in my life so I don't
00:33:05 expect any of my friends
00:33:07 to remain my friends
00:33:09 I have no expectation they're gonna do that
00:33:11 unless I make myself
00:33:13 valuable to them and like helpful
00:33:15 and positive in some way
00:33:17 no matter how long you've been friends with someone
00:33:19 they don't owe you
00:33:21 nobody owes anyone anything
00:33:23 if you expect
00:33:25 people to want to be your friend
00:33:27 you need like not like
00:33:29 you need to give them shit but like
00:33:31 it needs to be worth their life
00:33:33 it needs to be worth their life
00:33:35 they need to get something out of it
00:33:37 not material stuff but like you know
00:33:39 like conversation someone to talk to
00:33:41 someone to feel like they understand what you're talking about
00:33:43 someone who's been with you for a long time
00:33:45 just comfort
00:33:47 like maybe it sounds kind of cynical
00:33:49 you know relationships are built on
00:33:51 like mutual
00:33:53 mutual benefit that people
00:33:55 are to each other that's exactly right
00:33:57 that's just what a relationship is
00:33:59 that cynical
00:34:01 you could read it like
00:34:03 I'm only gonna be your friend if I'm getting something out of it
00:34:05 here's what's important about that though
00:34:07 if you are willing to accept friends into your life
00:34:09 who you don't have expectations for
00:34:11 you don't say like listen
00:34:13 if you are being a real piece of shit
00:34:15 this is not continuing
00:34:17 if you are generous enough with yourself
00:34:19 you are actually doing a disservice to those people
00:34:21 because you're not
00:34:23 you're not giving them barriers to rise to
00:34:25 so they can improve themselves
00:34:27 so that for like I'm a big guy who thinks that
00:34:29 self-improven is the root of all happiness
00:34:31 I'm a big guy
00:34:33 like if we just allow people
00:34:35 like for example that's why I don't like
00:34:37 I don't like enabling people
00:34:39 to just I don't like the idea of like
00:34:41 giving a person a fish instead of teaching them to fish
00:34:43 like obviously I think
00:34:45 moral issue
00:34:47 like if you give them the fish
00:34:49 you are
00:34:51 you're choosing
00:34:53 not to give them the way that's better for them
00:34:55 long term you know you understand what I'm saying here
00:34:57 I'm talking about like
00:34:59 I'm getting really distracted about what's going on behind me here
00:35:01 but something about
00:35:03 something about fucking
00:35:05 I'm losing my goddamn training thought here
00:35:07 what's going on
00:35:09 nobody owes you shit
00:35:11 it is best for you
00:35:13 yourself so that you have more to offer the world
00:35:15 because then you are just you literally
00:35:17 have more value as a person
00:35:19 so if your friends are just pieces of shit
00:35:21 who just placate you and just over and over again
00:35:23 say like everything you do is fine all your fuck ups are fine
00:35:25 like don't worry about it will still be your friends no matter what
00:35:27 they are doing you a disservice
00:35:29 by not holding to a higher standard
00:35:31 which will force you to grow and improve as a person
00:35:33 and if they really care about you
00:35:35 if they're really your friends that's what they'll do
00:35:37 and that's how I approach life there you go
00:35:39 that's how I treat my subs that's how I treat everybody
00:35:41 that's my concept
00:35:43 that's a good twitter video yeah you're right
00:35:45 you know what you're right I should do that
00:35:47 did you touch on something that I want to talk about
00:35:49 because this ties into the age difference
00:35:51 grow lol concept
00:35:53 show the concept we've got going on
00:35:55 right in the background
00:35:57 where you talk about how you prefer
00:35:59 in person meetings
00:36:01 and obviously I agree this is quite nice
00:36:03 well
00:36:05 I feel like
00:36:07 no but
00:36:09 hey that I put the impression
00:36:11 how is that going to read
00:36:13 in the video form
00:36:15 you can't see my
00:36:17 it's also in my knee
00:36:19 that's what we'll tell you
00:36:21 yeah that's what I'm saying
00:36:23 but I get the impression that everyone is very
00:36:25 I mean
00:36:27 chatting online and going into internet calls
00:36:29 is not at all something that anyone
00:36:31 would desire to do
00:36:33 well it's not the ideal
00:36:35 it's not the ideal
00:36:37 but I've lived my entire life having mostly internet friends
00:36:39 because I was an introverted kid
00:36:41 when I was a little babby
00:36:43 just like you are right now
00:36:45 well it's like
00:36:47 here's the thing
00:36:49 with give for example this is really relevant
00:36:51 if we didn't have internet communication
00:36:53 we wouldn't have any communication
00:36:55 it wasn't fucking England so it's all we got
00:36:57 so I don't think it's either
00:36:59 we should always meet in person
00:37:01 or not at all
00:37:03 you take the best you can get
00:37:05 I'm just saying an interesting point
00:37:07 that I've had most internet friends
00:37:09 have any of you had
00:37:11 serious online friends
00:37:13 oh yeah I mean
00:37:15 up until I started having a relationship
00:37:17 that period
00:37:19 of me sort of burning off
00:37:21 my friends from back home
00:37:23 just because again
00:37:25 while I liked them all fine
00:37:27 we weren't doing any of the same shit
00:37:29 so for a while I was just talking to the PCP
00:37:31 pretty much
00:37:33 all the time and then
00:37:35 that was most of my
00:37:37 social interaction
00:37:39 and funnily enough being in the PCP chat
00:37:41 made me stop talking to everyone else on the internet
00:37:43 because I used to have other internet friends
00:37:45 outside the PCP
00:37:47 but it was just that it was so much easier
00:37:49 because there's a bunch of us
00:37:51 and if I told you guys about something
00:37:53 going on we could have a whole
00:37:55 conversation about it and then if I try to tell somebody else
00:37:57 it's like well now I gotta have a whole fucking
00:37:59 second conversation about it
00:38:01 so like to me it was just
00:38:03 kind of like the most convenient social interaction
00:38:05 is to just post in this chat
00:38:07 where all of the people most relevant to me
00:38:09 will see it and if you're not in that group
00:38:11 it's just like too much of a pain
00:38:13 in the ass for me to contact you
00:38:15 to tell you what's going on with me
00:38:17 you know
00:38:19 you can tell me what's going on with you maybe I'll be interested
00:38:21 probably not
00:38:23 but you know
00:38:25 it's a roll of the dice
00:38:27 but you've had mostly
00:38:29 in real life friends right
00:38:31 I mean for me growing up
00:38:33 I usually had one friend
00:38:35 any place I lived that was relatively
00:38:37 close and I did cherish
00:38:39 those friendships but I would move
00:38:41 all the time and lose those friends so like
00:38:43 I'm used to sort of transient
00:38:45 friendships and that's why
00:38:47 a lot of my online friendships
00:38:49 they were just as valid as my offline ones
00:38:51 but they were also just as likely to
00:38:53 just end out of nowhere
00:38:55 yeah
00:38:57 I stopped talking like if I don't
00:38:59 maintain contact with somebody
00:39:01 eventually after a couple of
00:39:03 like you know let's say
00:39:05 six months of not talking to somebody
00:39:07 it feels like do I even still know them
00:39:09 you know and then sometimes
00:39:11 people will come back and they'll try to establish
00:39:13 like Tom there was a while where we just totally
00:39:15 fucking didn't even hear from you
00:39:17 like after the
00:39:19 PCP got formed and I started talking to them
00:39:21 you sort of were hanging out
00:39:23 with like a different click
00:39:25 and really talk to each other until
00:39:27 BronyCon when you met
00:39:29 the rest of the PCP guys and were like oh these guys seem cool
00:39:31 I won't pay them on whatever this is
00:39:33 I don't matter it's fine
00:39:35 this is a conversation
00:39:37 so I'm out of the shot
00:39:39 well now they're together
00:39:41 once you were in there
00:39:43 Victor got the both of them
00:39:45 did you hear this lives
00:39:47 there you go
00:39:49 kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss
00:39:51 kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss
00:39:53 kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss
00:40:23 kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss haircut
00:40:40 Well, okay, there's two different things I'm talking about here
00:40:42 One is like actual social media falling like you make content whatever people are gravitate to you
00:40:46 I mean like I met my girlfriend through my videos ultimately, you know
00:40:49 She we connected through what I put like my snapchat info out and we eventually connected
00:40:53 I don't like you and may met the same way. Yeah, you know
00:40:56 It's just it sure is a pretty cool thing that we got all the social media going on. You know I'm saying
00:41:01 Are you going into like
00:41:04 Fans who become friends a little bit a little bit
00:41:06 Yeah, I think there's like a word that we might need for like people who are fans
00:41:20 Well, he said friends fans that you like but aren't technically friends. Yeah, I guess
00:41:24 Like if they rise to just be friends then then you're
00:41:33 This is great come back to this and just I'm saying but did you as an instrument
00:41:36 They say that you feel like after six months. You don't really feel like you know the person anymore
00:41:40 Yeah, you've been much better recently, but I felt that way about you recently
00:41:44 Well, the funny thing is just dropped off the map
00:41:47 The funny thing is about me that I will open my mouth every time something has changed
00:41:52 But nothing has changed like I moved into yeah, okay
00:41:55 I moved into a house
00:41:56 That is in the middle of like nowhere and it basically it's just like well
00:42:00 I'm here for the next year
00:42:01 So I'm just gonna make videos and smoke pot until this year is over
00:42:04 So like there's just nothing new to tell people about it's like I am in the same sort of I'm the same sort of person
00:42:11 I was however my mind state has shifted and that's harder to describe in my mind she's shifting right now
00:42:21 Your gender for you by the way it came up with your gender
00:42:29 Well, you're wondering when you're sober and you're wondering when you're hot
00:42:42 Okay, so would you say that like like now like are you coming out of of the the dark ages would you say
00:42:50 It's really changed I mean he's you know
00:42:52 It's just a it's like I'm here cuz rad cons happening
00:42:56 Yeah, and when rad cons over I'll go back home and I'll put my nose in my work
00:43:00 And that's where I'll be until I move
00:43:02 And then I'll put my nose in my moving and I won't be able to talk to anybody
00:43:06 So I'll be too busy moving and then I won't be able to talk to anybody because I'll be too busy setting setting
00:43:10 You know what my new place then I won't be able to talk to anybody
00:43:13 So I'll be too busy trying to get back to work because I missed all that work from when I was moving
00:43:17 And then I won't be able to talk to anybody for the next year because I'll still be catching up on work for the rest of that
00:43:22 Year, that's what happened the last year. That's why I lost contact
00:43:27 Well, here's a fact. Okay. Here's a here's a utilitarianism type fact
00:43:33 It's just that the financial structure of the PCP was facilitated to encourage friendship
00:43:40 Because it was financially structured by me as a genius to to incentivize people coming back regularly to participate
00:43:48 That was the main goal of it. It's all like percentage based
00:43:52 It's based on people who like come and do the most they are the ones who will acquire the most money, you know
00:43:56 All that it's however much you put in it's how much you get out. That's right. That's that's right
00:44:00 And so, you know basically like guys who show up a lot get you know a good chunk of guys who don't get less
00:44:06 But there's always an incentive to contribute more and because it's all percentage the better the PCP does the better everyone
00:44:12 Does and so basically what I'm getting to is I want to just take a moment to say everyone you're welcome for this friendship
00:44:18 You are welcome. Yeah, I accept your attitude
00:44:27 That's all I've got to say
00:44:30 It's my point
00:44:33 Talk to your friends when you get the chance not you just anyone
00:44:37 I'm so bad at maintaining friendships. I know we're talking about this extensively and talking to my friends
00:44:54 Frame
00:44:59 And look the camera just loves them
00:45:16 Just drink it in
00:45:21 Like it doesn't matter how lonely I am sitting there being the loneliest boy of all and I'll just be thinking and I'll be like
00:45:29 Oh, man, if only maybe I wish I talked to my friends more
00:45:32 But then I'll like think about all the friends that I have and be like no, I bet they don't want to talk to me
00:45:40 I don't really have anything to say to them, so I just won't even bother
00:45:43 Here's the problem then the problem is you are not being smart enough with your brain and here's
00:46:00 You're not being smart enough with your brain in the sense that okay, like
00:46:05 When I think I recognize I recognize that I'm a weak human flawed machine
00:46:11 And I know that this weak human shell
00:46:13 Sometimes will feel loneliness and I need to
00:46:16 Calculate in my plan for how I continue to operate this vessel that I need to account for friendship issues because I will get lonely
00:46:22 So with that which before you get lonely because if you feel lonely you might feel like guilty about reaching out to friends
00:46:28 Like oh, I'm just reaching out to him because he's my friend
00:46:29 But you can trick yourself into thinking that you're actually a good friend by just
00:46:34 Constantly doing little updates with your friends like I don't know checking in with them frequently that way you never
00:46:39 It's like if you eat a lot throughout the day if you want to stay fit
00:46:43 You should eat a lot of vegetables throughout the day
00:46:45 So you don't let yourself get hungry and then you binge and you fuck it up
00:46:47 But just like that you should you should manage you should schedule your friendship a little bit throughout the day
00:46:52 So that you don't let your loneliness build up and then you just feel like a piece of shit
00:46:58 Like the Sims yeah, just talk to your friends when you want to but yeah, but no one wants to do that. Nobody wants to do that
00:47:06 I can't small talk to save my life
00:47:09 Like here at radcon like we're just like constantly just like doing random shit. Yeah, that's how you know dance-off toilet seats comes around
00:47:16 That's right, but like in terms of like online like I can't just be like hey Nate. What's up?
00:47:21 I mean, I never do that. Hey, what's up? I'll never in my life
00:47:24 Okay, I'll post memes all the time all the time sure in the chat when like when there's when there's no like
00:47:33 Purpose that we're like that there's like when there's no like purpose that we're deliberately trying to do
00:47:37 I find it so hard to like maintain a conversation if they're if like it's not going leading towards something
00:47:44 Yeah, go into some end goal. I'm like, I'll just be like what's this? Oh, it's that okay done
00:47:50 Yeah, I agree that it feels like that and I agree that that that is not even a bad thing to feel because did you when me
00:47:57 Knew for started talking. I realized I was not going to get into the pants of this famous person just by asking
00:48:02 Hey, did you have how's it going? Yeah, right?
00:48:04 I scheduled my conversation with you specifically could emotionally manipulate you to being my friend, right?
00:48:09 That's the right way to do it. Yeah, that's how I got into the group. Yeah first place
00:48:14 Yeah, I think like I only talked to digi and Jesse at the time because when I had something to talk about
00:48:20 We all loved just the stuff, but I think I'll share a kind of like weird autism where we want our social
00:48:27 Interactions to all be like plotted and like a game and like everything is like like there's like a stat management
00:48:33 Or like we're trying to envision at least like Vincent in the vapors like everyone stats as we analyze them
00:48:38 Yeah, sort what combination of words will I say to make them like have this impression?
00:48:44 And I completely agree that that is definitely what we all do
00:48:47 But let me just pause it that maybe it shouldn't be that way
00:48:51 Maybe we should try and change it. I the point where we are just normal people. I don't think I don't actually think that way
00:48:58 But here's the thing in my life. I think that's how a lot of our friendships
00:49:02 It's just that in my life overall
00:49:04 I have certain goals
00:49:06 I wish to reach and all I care about is reaching those goals and friendship is a great thing
00:49:11 And that's one of my goals to have good friendships and have good friends
00:49:14 So but my goal is to not put more effort into things that I have to
00:49:21 There's no one has an obligation to talk to anyone
00:49:24 No, there's an obligation to have any friends whatsoever
00:49:26 I just think that it's a nice thing to have and it will help you emotionally physically spiritually and sexually to have friends
00:49:34 Absolutely, I want to know something that is I think a sort of pratfall of it. Why Nate? Why Nate?
00:49:39 I know what they want to say
00:49:41 Oh
00:49:48 What are the pratfalls of
00:49:50 Communicating through a chat room Chris pratfall. What does pratfall mean?
00:49:54 Pratfalls is like a stage fall. Oh, it is. I think so. Yeah, like a pitfall. Do you mean a pitfall?
00:49:58 Like what's the like what Stephen Colbert did?
00:50:01 He's right. A pretfall is a stage fall. That's right. I mean, if I could meet a hero John Oliver once again. Okay, one of the pitfalls
00:50:07 Yes, there you go. Did I get on camera when I was sharing that bit of that tidbit of wisdom?
00:50:10 No, you did not.
00:50:12 Wasted!
00:50:13 Do you know how hard it is to switch between six people?
00:50:16 He's right. Do you know how hard it is to keep my gun in my home studio?
00:50:24 There you go. We got it.
00:50:28 That's a mean. That's a mean.
00:50:30 That's a good one. That's a mean.
00:50:32 Oh no.
00:50:34 I just put it down.
00:50:38 Anyway, what are the pitfalls of communicating through a chat room?
00:50:42 Sometimes you have, you think that you're in there all the time and no one else does.
00:50:48 Because I read every message that gets posted in the PCP chat.
00:50:52 How?
00:50:53 I just always do. I just read the whole thing every time I enter it.
00:50:57 Sometimes there's just a ton.
00:50:59 I mean, if there's like 5,000 messages, I will just skim it and see if it's something I care about.
00:51:05 I'm not going to read all of it no matter what.
00:51:08 But generally, the way I use the internet is just constantly clicking between the same five or six websites over and over again.
00:51:16 That's how everybody uses the internet now.
00:51:18 Unfortunately, but Discord is one of those.
00:51:21 Although I actually had to remove it from my taskbar so I would check it less.
00:51:25 Because I would get so obsessed.
00:51:27 I would just get locked into it for a whole day and I'd be like, this is so bad for productivity.
00:51:32 That's an insanely interesting thing about how you will be able to receive messages
00:51:37 and visually know and understand the conversation that is currently happening or that it has happened.
00:51:43 But no one will know that because you have not typed something into the chat.
00:51:46 It's not like where I can just talk to you and you have to say yes, Munchy.
00:51:50 I know that you're seeing.
00:51:52 I've got a sort of sense of who...
00:51:54 I know Ben doesn't read all the chat because Ben will come in and ask a question about something that was discussed literally a minute ago.
00:52:00 I'm really bad at not reading the chat.
00:52:02 But generally...
00:52:04 Even when we at Ben extensively, he will not look at his messages and his ads or what not.
00:52:10 But generally because the PCP is the only...
00:52:13 There's only a couple Discord groups I'm even in.
00:52:15 It's like the PCP, my Patreon Discord, the PCP Patreon Discord, and a couple that I have muted.
00:52:22 So if I'm opening it, that's the only reason.
00:52:26 I check it so often that most of the time there is nothing new there.
00:52:31 But I do read it probably more than anybody.
00:52:35 But I just don't respond.
00:52:37 So it looks like I'm not there.
00:52:39 Tom, what is the importance of friendship?
00:52:44 How much time does it take up in your life?
00:52:48 How much mental energy?
00:52:50 How much do you care about your friends?
00:52:51 I mean, I care about my friends a lot.
00:52:54 There was a period for a while, like last year, or maybe 2016, where I felt like I fell off the bandwagon with everybody in the PCP.
00:53:02 Just because 2016 was a pretty shitty year for me.
00:53:05 And I remember going into Radcon too.
00:53:08 I was like, I want to actively try and participate more and get back into it and be...
00:53:12 Because it was bumming me out that I wasn't...
00:53:15 And you've taken a way more active role since then, in general.
00:53:18 Yeah, because I just, I don't know, I'm interested in it.
00:53:22 I like being a part of the group, I like helping out, I like doing things.
00:53:26 That's why I was like, I'll go do all the podcast part, because I know how to do it, and somebody has to get it done.
00:53:32 So, no, even my offline friends...
00:53:35 It's weird, because I have a couple offline friends that I've had forever.
00:53:38 And they're like two very different kinds of people, I guess, from our relationships with them.
00:53:44 Because we're saying how friends have to be like...
00:53:47 You have to get something out of it.
00:53:50 One of the friends I have, I kind of don't...
00:53:53 Do you even like hanging out with them or anything?
00:53:56 That depends on the day.
00:54:00 But I've known this guy forever.
00:54:03 Maybe you get a sense of comfort, a sense of regularity.
00:54:06 Something like that, a sense of stability in your life.
00:54:09 It's interesting though, because I have another friend that I've known for probably close to 15 years now.
00:54:13 And we don't have anything really in common anymore.
00:54:16 We're both kind of like nerds and play video games.
00:54:19 That's like a very service level thing, and he lives like four towns over.
00:54:22 But every time we hang out, it clicks.
00:54:25 And we just throw out and just talk shit, whatever, and it's like fucking great.
00:54:29 So, even though we don't have any really common interests anymore,
00:54:33 we still get along really well.
00:54:35 But in terms of friendships and relationships, my favorite is when they're into the same sort of shit I am.
00:54:40 Because I feel like that's so important to me.
00:54:43 This is something that I don't think people who don't create things really get.
00:54:46 That sometimes the friendship is the end goal.
00:54:49 Like, oh, we're just going to go out to the club and do whatever.
00:54:52 And that's the thing. And I'm just like, no.
00:54:55 Well, I mean, that can be fun and all.
00:54:57 Well, it can be. But for me, I don't know.
00:55:00 Because making art and doing things is so central to who I am.
00:55:04 If you can't, at the very least, comprehend that.
00:55:07 It's almost like a deal breaker.
00:55:09 And if you're into that in the trenches with me, it makes it so much more valuable.
00:55:13 Because the biggest part of who I am, you understand.
00:55:16 And we can discuss that on a deeper level.
00:55:19 Friendships are cool and all.
00:55:21 But having friends is not the end goal.
00:55:25 I have end goals of my own that I want to improve.
00:55:28 And you're blocking your own face.
00:55:30 Oh, I didn't even know. Oh, wow, is the camera on?
00:55:33 Yeah, but friendship for the sake of friendship.
00:55:38 That's fine. I'm not saying that's bad.
00:55:40 But a great friendship, I feel like, is something that helps you in your life
00:55:44 as you're pursuing the things that you want to pursue.
00:55:47 And hopefully you're doing the same for your friend.
00:55:50 I would describe my relationship balancing work, artwork, and friendship.
00:55:56 Due to the fact that I feel like you need to live your life in order to create good art.
00:56:02 You need to have moments that are not art.
00:56:04 So I would describe it as almost...
00:56:06 This is going to get really autistic.
00:56:08 And I shouldn't be thinking about like this.
00:56:10 I shouldn't be able to visualize it like this.
00:56:12 And it should just be a normal human thing.
00:56:14 But I'm autistic and it works like this.
00:56:16 I view not working as creating coal ore in Minecraft.
00:56:22 I know exactly what I'm talking about.
00:56:24 You're banking experience.
00:56:26 And then when I go to work, I'm mining that.
00:56:29 You're not mining that.
00:56:31 You're not!
00:56:33 No!
00:56:35 Go on the side!
00:56:39 Thank you!
00:56:43 Yeah, so I get my pickaxe and I mine that shit.
00:56:46 But eventually my reservoirs will deplete.
00:56:48 So I need to go out and live my life.
00:56:50 So I can have stuff to use my art.
00:56:52 And obviously, I just enjoy planting those coal blocks, those diamonds.
00:56:55 I just like it.
00:56:57 I've got the more extreme version of that.
00:56:59 Where I can have a difficulty justifying doing anything
00:57:02 unless I know I can make it into art.
00:57:04 Unless I know...
00:57:06 I'm only mining for diamond.
00:57:08 I'm not going for anything less.
00:57:10 I'm constantly...
00:57:12 The shows I watch are dependent on
00:57:14 do I think I'll be able to make an analysis video.
00:57:16 The people I...
00:57:18 I hang out with you guys because I know
00:57:20 we're going to make videos together.
00:57:22 And it's not going to be...
00:57:24 I usually go for iron and up.
00:57:26 Because it's not really like you can know
00:57:28 that like this specific...
00:57:30 I don't really think of it like, okay, we're going to a movie.
00:57:32 What can I do with this movie?
00:57:34 Because just hang out with your friends.
00:57:36 You might have a conversation and you might see something in your life.
00:57:38 I'm trying to be more like that.
00:57:40 I think it was a big problem in my life that I got that way.
00:57:42 And I do think...
00:57:44 I mean, a big part of what makes a Radcon fun,
00:57:46 like especially this house,
00:57:48 this house has so much random shit
00:57:50 that we've been able to take advantage of
00:57:52 to make art out of.
00:57:54 We know that it's going to be like that.
00:57:56 Shout out to Dan.
00:57:58 Shout out to our boy Dan.
00:58:00 We're coming for your ass.
00:58:02 We're shutting you down.
00:58:04 And the audience won't really know this
00:58:06 because they haven't seen that much of the content we've made.
00:58:08 We've filmed like countless fucking
00:58:10 weird random vlogs
00:58:12 based on the random shit in this house
00:58:14 and what it's inspired us to do.
00:58:16 Can I just remind everyone
00:58:18 what a great fucking idea was
00:58:20 to get the arena?
00:58:22 So, shout out to my boy Gib.
00:58:24 Rest in peace.
00:58:26 Just real quick,
00:58:28 for everyone in the audience,
00:58:30 Radcon 3 is not all live stream let's plays
00:58:32 and vlogs. It's not all that.
00:58:34 There's other stuff. We promise it will be here soon.
00:58:36 It's not all that.
00:58:38 I would hope that people fucking understand
00:58:40 that you have to edit the videos
00:58:42 before they can come out.
00:58:44 But on every fucking live stream,
00:58:46 they're like, wow, another live stream.
00:58:48 We paid $9,000 for this.
00:58:50 And even when the live streams are happening,
00:58:52 there's always like another thing happening.
00:58:54 The whole point of Radcon
00:58:56 is that two things are always happening at the same time
00:58:58 unless we're all in the same video.
00:59:00 Pretty much.
00:59:02 Well, if something happens to you right now,
00:59:04 there's Victor's mining on my fucking CPU
00:59:06 for that cycles.
00:59:08 He's buying PCPine right fucking now, dude.
00:59:10 That's right.
00:59:12 Who's talking?
00:59:14 Ben.
00:59:16 How important,
00:59:18 how much time does friendship take up in your life
00:59:20 and how important is it to you
00:59:22 and how much do you think about it in shit?
00:59:24 Uh.
00:59:26 It's like a dog.
00:59:28 What is wrong with Ben?
00:59:30 He's having a panic attack.
00:59:32 I get panic when I see myself on the screen
00:59:34 because I don't like what I see.
00:59:36 Then why do you ask for the camera to be on your office?
00:59:38 I don't know.
00:59:40 It's a real hedgehog's dilemma
00:59:42 of the camera.
00:59:44 Well, I mean, how much do I think
00:59:46 of friendship? Probably
00:59:48 Seven.
00:59:50 Like a bunch.
00:59:52 I think about my friends
00:59:54 and the people
00:59:56 that I care about
00:59:58 and that inspire me
01:00:00 and I aspire to be like
01:00:02 and everything.
01:00:04 I think about that a lot.
01:00:06 Seven or eight.
01:00:08 How much do I actually interact?
01:00:10 Two.
01:00:12 That's pretty low.
01:00:14 Ben has always been
01:00:16 Ben has always been
01:00:18 as long as I've known
01:00:20 as long as Ben's been an independent person
01:00:22 it's been incredibly hard to get a hold of Ben.
01:00:24 Just across the board.
01:00:26 It's always tough.
01:00:28 It's true if you like call Ben with your phone
01:00:30 maybe 50% of the time he'll answer.
01:00:32 Less.
01:00:34 But everything below that
01:00:36 like trying to message him on Discord
01:00:38 and maybe it's just that Ben's lifestyle
01:00:40 has him less tuned into what's going on
01:00:42 than the other types of communication apps.
01:00:44 Well, but
01:00:46 I don't know, tweets, messages
01:00:48 like text messages you won't respond to
01:00:50 is this all part of the same thing?
01:00:52 Tweets, I will
01:00:54 it's like
01:00:56 I'll see them
01:00:58 most of the time I'll see them
01:01:00 and I'll think
01:01:02 okay and then I'll like
01:01:04 think about it for a while
01:01:06 and if I'm still thinking about it
01:01:08 like days later
01:01:10 what I want to say maybe then
01:01:12 if I'm still thinking about it
01:01:14 I'll be like I'll respond to that
01:01:16 and then I'll do it
01:01:18 You know, you were just telling us a story
01:01:20 about how our mother
01:01:22 our dear sweet departed mother
01:01:24 was trying to reach you like yesterday
01:01:26 rest in peace, the funeral was a great time
01:01:28 It was actually here, we had a funeral pyro
01:01:30 and everything
01:01:32 That's what the group piss was on
01:01:34 We had to put out the funeral pyro
01:01:36 somehow
01:01:38 Look forward to that in the behind the scenes
01:01:40 ACP vlog
01:01:42 Very Nate's
01:01:44 And I'm not joking
01:01:46 it will be in there
01:01:48 Anyway
01:01:50 our mother, our dear sweet mother
01:01:52 was trying to reach Ben and called him for days
01:01:54 and eventually
01:01:56 she stopped calling him eventually
01:01:58 Ben called her back days later
01:02:00 and said hey mom can I help you with that
01:02:02 and she says oh no I stopped
01:02:04 I just called Nate and they took care of it
01:02:06 Ben claimed that her little words were
01:02:08 oh I gave up
01:02:10 Yeah
01:02:12 They gave up
01:02:14 Mom's the same way, mom never answers a phone
01:02:16 Only I'm a thousand times worse
01:02:18 No, you just don't know the stats
01:02:20 Mom won't answer her cell phone at home
01:02:22 you have to call the home phone so she picks up at home
01:02:24 and when she's out she's hard to reach
01:02:26 You got to know the tips and tricks
01:02:28 Ben, multiple times
01:02:30 I have woken up
01:02:32 and there will be the little discord red notification
01:02:34 from Benz and I'll click on it
01:02:36 One
01:02:38 and there will be nothing there
01:02:40 so this has happened multiple times
01:02:42 where you've tried to get out of your shell
01:02:44 and talk to me
01:02:46 but then you're like no I can't say hi
01:02:48 I have to delete this
01:02:50 Really? Yeah
01:02:52 Yeah, sometimes
01:02:54 It's way too scary
01:02:56 We're literally every single time
01:02:58 you've been like Ben
01:03:00 you have my full attention for like three hours
01:03:02 How embarrassing
01:03:04 It's fully confirmed
01:03:06 Sometimes I'll spend a lot of time
01:03:08 thinking about a note that I want to send to somebody
01:03:10 or spending a lot of time debating
01:03:12 Do I actually want to commit to talking to this person
01:03:14 like this is going to open up a whole conversation
01:03:16 but once I've sent a message
01:03:18 you know sometimes I will delete it
01:03:20 Sometimes I will delete it
01:03:22 I've deleted these messages a few times
01:03:24 but not very often
01:03:26 I've done it once or twice in my entire life
01:03:28 Yeah, I've only if it's something
01:03:30 I'm fucking literally fucked up something
01:03:32 Yeah
01:03:34 I have this thing where
01:03:36 I won't respond unless
01:03:38 I think of something to respond with immediately
01:03:40 and otherwise I will never respond
01:03:42 I'm a little bit the same way
01:03:44 where I'll occasionally get messages
01:03:46 from certain problematic people
01:03:48 and I'll be like
01:03:50 I feel like to think about what I'm going to say to this person
01:03:52 I don't want to talk to this person for that long
01:03:54 I'll think about this for a while
01:03:56 I'll come back to it
01:03:59 I think there's one to it now
01:04:01 Sometimes it'll be something
01:04:03 that like it doesn't really
01:04:05 need a response
01:04:07 and other times it'll be something that merits a response
01:04:09 but I don't know what response to give
01:04:11 or that I want to give
01:04:13 and then I'll just be like
01:04:15 We're so fucked
01:04:17 My problem
01:04:19 The thing is for me is that I'm constantly inundated
01:04:21 with people trying to get my attention
01:04:23 and like it's on every different social media
01:04:25 it's in my emails
01:04:27 I can't tell the difference
01:04:29 I can't take a response immediately
01:04:31 You gotta put in the big toe
01:04:33 not clickbait
01:04:35 I'm going to
01:04:37 I'm going to a convention
01:04:39 next month
01:04:41 and they keep emailing me
01:04:43 about we need you to tell us
01:04:45 what are your panels going to be
01:04:47 and because I couldn't immediately
01:04:49 give them an answer
01:04:51 they had to send me 20 emails
01:04:53 before I finally got back to them
01:04:55 and this is how tons of people who
01:04:57 maybe set up a collab
01:04:59 with me or something
01:05:01 If you're someone who's tried to reach me
01:05:03 and I've never responded, I'm sorry
01:05:05 but there's a thousand of you
01:05:07 Here's back scenes footage
01:05:09 Did you approach me to try and give me to design
01:05:11 t-shirts for him?
01:05:13 I gave him designs like maybe
01:05:15 like three days afterward
01:05:17 have not heard back from him for like four months
01:05:19 into this day
01:05:21 There's a couple different
01:05:23 I was just going to say that
01:05:25 I feel like I'm having trouble
01:05:27 coming up with stuff to say
01:05:29 because I don't really have a grasp
01:05:31 on how good I am as a friend
01:05:33 like in terms of like
01:05:35 responding on things
01:05:37 You're good
01:05:39 You're one of the high tier respondents
01:05:41 I would say that you are probably
01:05:43 the
01:05:45 I think we're the best
01:05:47 Me, Munchy, Tom and Gib
01:05:49 are the ones you can rely on
01:05:51 like fast in the PCP
01:05:53 Everyone else will wait in eternity
01:05:55 I'm in the chat all the time
01:05:57 I like reading it and responding to things
01:05:59 I know the feeling of
01:06:01 I need acknowledgement
01:06:03 from this person whether or not they've seen it
01:06:05 so I will try to
01:06:07 at least type the letter K
01:06:09 K
01:06:11 And then I add KK after
01:06:13 I would consider you one of my most important friends
01:06:15 because of the fact that you are
01:06:17 one of the only people
01:06:19 who not only do I
01:06:21 love and respect your content
01:06:23 but you actually watch mine
01:06:25 because you're the only PCP member
01:06:27 who watches like
01:06:29 actually both of you
01:06:31 Well, I kind of stopped recently
01:06:33 I do watch your main channel
01:06:35 Yeah, but those two
01:06:37 will watch like my obscure podcast
01:06:39 Yeah, I will do that
01:06:41 and it's nice
01:06:43 that like
01:06:45 someone at least
01:06:47 who's friends with me
01:06:49 actually thinks my stuff is all worth
01:06:51 their time
01:06:53 It's not because
01:06:55 I don't think it's all not worth watching
01:06:57 The reason I don't keep up with all your shit is too full
01:06:59 Number one, you are way too
01:07:01 way more into anime than me
01:07:03 so lots of you talk about it
01:07:05 I don't even...
01:07:07 I'm sure if I clicked and watched it I'd be like
01:07:09 Oh, I can understand this
01:07:11 but like the title and thumbnail I'm just like
01:07:13 I don't fucking know what that is
01:07:15 It's just that because
01:07:17 I have my own stuff to do
01:07:19 like working on my own
01:07:21 Stopping and being like
01:07:23 I'm gonna marathon like 75 hours
01:07:25 I can't really...
01:07:27 I never demand anybody to watch my shit
01:07:29 unless I think it's like
01:07:31 specifically this video is the one that hey
01:07:33 you guys will actually
01:07:35 you guys are gonna care about this one so make sure you watch it
01:07:37 but like otherwise
01:07:39 I just kind of count on the people
01:07:41 who I know are gonna check it out
01:07:43 I know I put out way too much shit
01:07:45 to like ask people to watch all my stuff
01:07:47 but like I'll watch everything everybody else does
01:07:49 in the PCP, you know
01:07:51 I am always like completely on top of the content
01:07:53 I mean I watch...
01:07:55 I don't know, I basically watch everything
01:07:57 The comics I'm sometimes behind on
01:07:59 I'm usually pretty good about instant update
01:08:01 I'm usually pretty good about...
01:08:03 I'm subscribed to all of you and generally watch everything
01:08:05 I didn't think you watched subscriptions
01:08:07 I got into them in the last couple years
01:08:09 I mean I finally have
01:08:11 incorporated them into my lifestyle at long last
01:08:13 Alright, well update to the Nate lore
01:08:15 There you go, there you go
01:08:17 Hippo, back at Recon 2
01:08:19 we didn't really know each other but we kind of liked each other
01:08:21 but what brought me and Hippo to be
01:08:23 big bros that I can consider to be a bro now
01:08:25 Yeah
01:08:27 Nice to meet you
01:08:29 Nice to meet you
01:08:31 It's fucking arm retrieval
01:08:33 because arm retrieval, the arm retrieval cast
01:08:35 has literally fucking like
01:08:37 tripled friendship
01:08:39 points ever since that fucking podcast
01:08:41 that like started
01:08:43 because here's what would happen, we would record a podcast
01:08:45 and then just because we were so pumped up
01:08:47 from talking about home sex so much
01:08:49 that we would just stand the call for like
01:08:51 fucking hours
01:08:53 It's unfortunate because some of the funniest stuff
01:08:55 was post arm retrieval recordings
01:08:57 When we did like the...
01:08:59 well it doesn't matter to talk about it
01:09:01 I was in some of the arm retrievals as well
01:09:03 not all of them, but yeah I experienced some of that
01:09:05 except for the ones that went super duper long
01:09:07 You see it with the PCP as well
01:09:09 like it's kind of like
01:09:11 so you know the podcast
01:09:13 is a reason for us to stay together
01:09:15 at this point it's a monetary reason
01:09:17 at first there wasn't any money in it but at this point now there is
01:09:19 so now there's like a hard reason for all of us to
01:09:21 contribute and do it but like
01:09:23 the real shit is kind of after the podcast
01:09:25 ends and we just hang out in the call
01:09:27 or beforehand
01:09:29 That doesn't happen
01:09:31 I hang out there for a while most of the time
01:09:33 Well okay, there will be
01:09:35 like maybe 20 minutes
01:09:37 of like okay I'm giving my audio to you
01:09:39 That's the real shit
01:09:41 That's not the real shit
01:09:43 That's not as real as like
01:09:45 post arm retrieval recordings
01:09:47 We did
01:09:49 an entire like we found a site
01:09:51 where you can create like
01:09:53 generate a suburbs thing
01:09:55 We just laughed about it
01:09:57 for fucking two hours
01:09:59 That's great but I'm thinking of the whole existence of the PCP
01:10:01 early on in the days we used to do that more
01:10:03 We're doing it less now
01:10:05 but there's still some
01:10:07 records saying that we kind of prefer text chat to voice chat
01:10:09 like we never go to happen to a call
01:10:11 for anything other than
01:10:13 I much prefer voice chat and I want to do it more
01:10:15 but no one else
01:10:17 What do you mean by prefer
01:10:19 being a voice chat is more of a commitment
01:10:21 which I'm less willing to do
01:10:23 because it means I have to focus
01:10:25 If I had to voice chat
01:10:27 I can't jack off at the same time
01:10:29 without it being obvious
01:10:31 It's a great way to communicate obviously
01:10:33 via voice chat of course
01:10:35 I like to be doing stuff
01:10:37 Maybe cool PCP
01:10:39 let's plays of TF2
01:10:41 You know what it probably isn't
01:10:43 it's probably that I draw more than I like video edit
01:10:45 so I don't even listen to anything to draw
01:10:47 so it's extremely easy for me to
01:10:49 be at a call and draw at the same time
01:10:51 and here, munchy fact
01:10:53 some of the most potent and extreme
01:10:55 and vivid emotional
01:10:57 bonds I've ever had with my friends
01:10:59 by this day were forged over
01:11:01 video games
01:11:03 Video games are the perfect excuse
01:11:05 especially online
01:11:07 I'm thinking about TF2 specifically right now
01:11:09 where I met one of my friends
01:11:11 to this very day who I love dearly, Paul
01:11:13 I met him just over
01:11:15 fucking voice chat because he was like
01:11:17 ranting about some weird republican shit
01:11:19 at like 3 in the morning on an Australian
01:11:21 furry only servant
01:11:23 he's not a furry and neither was I
01:11:25 I didn't know he was a furry
01:11:27 the only two non furries
01:11:29 in the room
01:11:31 and so
01:11:33 it was great because video games
01:11:35 are the perfect like you're talking one of them
01:11:37 you have to communicate and there is an objective
01:11:39 goal to do
01:11:41 but it's not like you got to
01:11:43 we're not fucking Comcasters right now
01:11:45 we don't have to fucking continually
01:11:47 Comcasters?
01:11:49 Comcasts, Gestapo
01:11:51 Stomps doing shit on your internet
01:11:53 we need them to get here to fix our
01:11:55 yeah
01:11:57 you have that baseline objective
01:11:59 you need to work with each other to do
01:12:01 but on top of that it's all just sweet
01:12:03 fucking game to know you
01:12:05 fucking like lore, fucking world building
01:12:07 fucking character building shit and that's what's good
01:12:09 video games fucking expedite fringes a lot
01:12:11 because it is good and I like it
01:12:13 and there's a goal and fucking thank you for Victor
01:12:15 well guys
01:12:17 we've gone through a lot on friendship
01:12:19 no we're not done
01:12:21 it's time we have to stop being friends
01:12:23 we have to stop being friends
01:12:25 I mean we probably going
01:12:27 like an hour and a half, two hours I think
01:12:29 are we really
01:12:31 I haven't even started reading like this
01:12:33 this is episode 100
01:12:35 we're going all night
01:12:37 not really
01:12:39 we could start taking questions if we wanted to
01:12:41 no
01:12:43 what do you have to say
01:12:45 Ben has notes he asked
01:12:47 I'm embarrassed
01:12:49 I'll die
01:12:51 what kind of people do you look for
01:12:53 what kind of friends do you work for
01:12:55 I want to be friends with people
01:12:57 I admire
01:12:59 and people that I think are cool
01:13:01 what if you become friends with the people you admire
01:13:03 and you learn their faults
01:13:05 and then you can no longer admire them in the same way you used to
01:13:07 it's a learning experience
01:13:09 if they turn out to really suck
01:13:11 then see you later
01:13:13 sorry for the shame
01:13:15 I guess
01:13:17 I kind of like having idols that I'll never meet
01:13:19 personally
01:13:21 who just are gods in my mind
01:13:23 I have those
01:13:25 that's how I feel about parkourdude91
01:13:27 because parkourdude91
01:13:29 commented on my lecture
01:13:31 and it was great and he
01:13:33 tweeted me and it was fantastic and I love him
01:13:35 and then many months later when I sent him
01:13:37 just like a tweet
01:13:39 congratulating that he was back on youtube
01:13:41 he was like yeah I hope you're still rocking that pizza onesie
01:13:43 like he remembers who I was
01:13:45 and I get the impression that he's
01:13:47 doesn't have really a lot of his play right now
01:13:49 and I could message him if I want
01:13:51 but like first of all I don't want to disrupt him
01:13:53 because he's literal a fucking genius
01:13:55 and he needs to be like a given space
01:13:57 and not fucked with
01:13:59 and also I almost feel like I'm not worthy
01:14:01 to talk to him
01:14:03 he's just so above me in every way that I cannot
01:14:05 I don't want to soil his fucking reputation
01:14:07 by ever having sent a message to me
01:14:09 fascinating
01:14:11 here's one thing that I want in friends
01:14:13 and that I need in friends
01:14:15 I think you'll agree with me Ben
01:14:17 you can't be too nice
01:14:19 now there's a culture that
01:14:21 especially in here where we are fucking rude
01:14:23 and rowdy and we'll just say whatever the fuck
01:14:25 and start drama with anyone
01:14:27 I'm not really about that
01:14:29 I want friends to be genuinely nice
01:14:31 but you can't be just nice
01:14:33 there are a lot of people in my life who I've met
01:14:35 who are just a nice guy
01:14:37 we can be rude to each other because we know
01:14:39 that we like each other
01:14:41 but there'll be like milk toast
01:14:43 like yeah I'll hold the door open for you
01:14:45 you know like I got your back you know
01:14:47 whatever and like that's nice and I appreciate it
01:14:49 and I like those people
01:14:51 but you have to have some sort of interesting
01:14:53 quirk about you that makes me gravitate
01:14:55 towards you you have to have a personality
01:14:57 that I genuinely care about
01:14:59 you can't just be nice
01:15:01 you need to have some meat on your bones
01:15:03 there should be a base layer of like
01:15:05 you're a nice person you're not a murderer
01:15:07 I almost feel like
01:15:09 I have this feeling that I don't know
01:15:11 if anyone else feels this way
01:15:13 but I almost feel
01:15:15 niceness is like being hot
01:15:17 and when you're going to sleep
01:15:19 and you have your blanket on that's really hot
01:15:21 but sometimes you can get like too hot
01:15:23 you can get too comfortable
01:15:25 it'll be really cold outside and you'll walk into your bedroom
01:15:27 like oh I can't wait to cozy up
01:15:29 but like you'll get too hot
01:15:31 so yeah I gotta take these covers off
01:15:33 I'm too hot right now this is too nice
01:15:35 I'm too comfortable I need to get more
01:15:37 what I hate is friends who just are like
01:15:39 yes men like if there's shit
01:15:41 that you need to be called on and they don't do it
01:15:43 a lot of that I think is cause
01:15:45 you want your friends to be honest
01:15:47 I don't want to be surrounded by a bunch of yes men
01:15:49 who just suck my fucking dick all day
01:15:51 I want people to give me real feedback
01:15:53 don't get me wrong I want my dick sucked all day
01:15:55 I want other people to do that
01:15:57 I have some people I know
01:15:59 or used to know who just like
01:16:01 I would talk to them and I would be having a discussion
01:16:03 like I have this problem I'm going to go to my friend
01:16:05 and I try and like see if they can help me with this
01:16:07 but I don't have the answer myself
01:16:09 I need to bounce ideas off someone
01:16:11 and the discussion would always go
01:16:13 I would present a situation
01:16:15 I would state my case and they would just kind of agree
01:16:17 with whatever I would present
01:16:19 there was nothing I could say that they'd like
01:16:21 no I disagree or no try this instead
01:16:23 they're just like you're doing everything right
01:16:25 like good good yes good yes I agree
01:16:27 I hate that
01:16:29 it's just kind of useless
01:16:31 yeah because like I feel like either A
01:16:33 you're not actually paying attention
01:16:35 I don't know which one's worse
01:16:37 so it's just like oh god I can't stand that
01:16:39 so like one of the things I really like
01:16:41 was when Hippo called me on my shit because I asked him
01:16:43 I was like am I fucking gay
01:16:45 he's like yeah you're gay fix it
01:16:47 that's not exactly what was said
01:16:49 but that was how I interpreted it
01:16:51 and it was good
01:16:53 he's bi-sexual
01:16:55 I'm like almost not gay
01:16:57 do you want to comment on that kid
01:16:59 I can't exactly remember what
01:17:01 the conversation was about
01:17:03 like why
01:17:05 your place in the procrastinate
01:17:07 is why something
01:17:09 and I was just like am I just
01:17:11 not a part of this anymore
01:17:13 you're just like well you just haven't done anything interesting
01:17:15 I was like oh I gotta do some interesting shit
01:17:17 you weren't making videos
01:17:19 you weren't making anything
01:17:21 and yeah
01:17:23 it really I think I guess
01:17:25 where this group is concerned it's an active thing
01:17:27 so like yes
01:17:29 if you're in the PCP you're like a member of the PCP
01:17:31 but if you like just decided like
01:17:33 look I'm going away for like six months to do stuff
01:17:35 that's fine but your absence will be felt
01:17:37 it's not really
01:17:39 but you kind of become like less of a member
01:17:41 just in the sense of you're not in the consciousness
01:17:43 of people who think about the show and stuff
01:17:45 I gotta talk about the kind of people who I look to
01:17:47 for friendship
01:17:49 is people who are working on something
01:17:51 because I want to work on it with them
01:17:53 like I generally
01:17:55 cause they end up bringing value
01:17:57 when I have friends
01:17:59 who I'm not really sure
01:18:01 what they're trying to do right now
01:18:03 it's harder for me to work with them
01:18:05 like if my friends are telling me
01:18:07 that like they're just like
01:18:09 not really sure like what
01:18:11 like oh I don't really know what kind of videos
01:18:13 I'm trying to pursue or I don't know if I want to do
01:18:15 YouTube or I don't know if I want to do this or that
01:18:17 or whatever they're doing
01:18:19 yeah well not like that
01:18:21 but I'm just like you know
01:18:23 if I can't follow the narrative
01:18:25 then it's like it's hard for me to help them
01:18:27 to work towards anything
01:18:29 cause I'm like well what are we building here
01:18:31 like to me when I'm hanging out with people
01:18:33 it's like we're trying to
01:18:35 you know like when we went to Boston
01:18:37 part of it was like let's scope this is a place to move
01:18:39 we're doing rad con 3 and part of it's like
01:18:41 this is a test to see what it'll be like
01:18:43 to have a you know
01:18:45 I gave you the hardest sell I've ever sold
01:18:47 fucking anyone in my entire life but like
01:18:49 like in an hour and a half I just straight just talk
01:18:51 and most of it wasn't even necessary cause you had me
01:18:53 so irrelevant
01:18:55 yeah
01:18:57 but like
01:18:59 yeah so
01:19:01 so it's easier like for instance
01:19:03 like Tom you and I
01:19:05 you had also messaged me I think at the same time
01:19:07 that you messaged him
01:19:09 I told you something similar
01:19:11 like that I
01:19:13 I like your stuff but that I was
01:19:15 I just like had no clear idea of
01:19:17 what you were trying to do at the time
01:19:19 and it's like I don't know how to promote
01:19:21 your work if I don't know
01:19:23 if I don't get what the goal is cause like
01:19:25 right now I'm really big into the idea of
01:19:27 trying to like promote everybody I really want
01:19:29 to get into marketing figuring out how to
01:19:31 like
01:19:33 but like in order for me to do that
01:19:35 I need to know what are you trying to sell yourself
01:19:37 as like who are you trying to
01:19:39 be what is the thing I should be pushing
01:19:41 like do I mention
01:19:43 uh
01:19:45 for a long time you you had noticed
01:19:47 that your rebel pixels link was still
01:19:49 in the channel descriptions of the PCP
01:19:51 and that was cause just at the time
01:19:53 that we you know made the podcast
01:19:55 that was what I had seen as your
01:19:57 current flagship you know so that's
01:19:59 why I linked it but like I only linked
01:20:01 whatever I considered everyone's main thing
01:20:03 you know and then like
01:20:05 obviously if that shifts but
01:20:07 like at times when it's not clear
01:20:09 what your main thing is and once you had rebel pixels
01:20:11 it was a lot easier cause I started
01:20:13 like posting those videos on Twitter all the time
01:20:15 and stuff and being like hey
01:20:17 this one was interesting and
01:20:19 I can help him grow this channel but
01:20:21 like you know it didn't we didn't make it
01:20:23 that far we got 10k's
01:20:25 well you know it's a complicated thing
01:20:27 you know it's kind of weird we
01:20:29 are kind of merchants
01:20:31 of social influence is sort of what
01:20:33 we have and that kind of can be
01:20:35 passed on from one person to another
01:20:37 like if you just bring a person on a live stream
01:20:39 and you've got like 10,000 subscribers
01:20:41 or whatever and you bring someone on they can end up
01:20:43 you know 50 subscribers after that
01:20:45 and look at our special guest PewDiePie
01:20:47 come on in
01:20:49 it's just
01:20:51 what I'm saying is that like there's kind of a weird
01:20:53 gamification of friendship
01:20:55 that's happened or like a monetization
01:20:57 of friendship that is real I mean
01:20:59 this podcast is sort of like that
01:21:01 but really it's more of like I don't know
01:21:03 do you ever feel the pressure of like people wanting
01:21:05 to get close to you just because they know that
01:21:07 that's like a currency that you can offer them
01:21:09 yes a lot
01:21:11 yeah I'm sure you do more than any of us
01:21:13 yeah definitely I feel
01:21:15 I ever really get the like the idea that
01:21:17 they are trying to be my friends specifically because I'm famous
01:21:19 because I'm not really famous but I definitely do
01:21:21 ever every so often have the pressure of
01:21:23 like someone really likes me and they
01:21:25 want to be my friend but I don't like
01:21:27 well there's that a lot
01:21:29 yeah I get just when people friend me
01:21:31 on discord as happened during this
01:21:33 live stream buddy I'm not gonna friend you
01:21:35 why would I friend you who the fuck are you
01:21:37 I will not accept friends from anybody I don't
01:21:39 know the worst oh my god the worst is
01:21:41 when you get people to say hey can I be your friend
01:21:43 or yeah I'm like that's
01:21:45 I don't think that has ever been
01:21:47 listen guys stop being
01:21:49 arrogant just think for
01:21:51 one second with your pea brain have you
01:21:53 done anything that would make me want
01:21:55 to be your friend take responsibility
01:21:57 think to yourself do I offer anything right
01:21:59 now or even if you're the best person in the world
01:22:01 have I demonstrated that I have value
01:22:03 or that I bring anything to the table
01:22:05 if so then I might want to be your friend
01:22:07 that's like the Gary V method where you talk about
01:22:09 like Gary V he's like a social influencer guy
01:22:11 like you got to work for free like if you want to
01:22:13 like be noticed by somebody like just be like
01:22:15 what can I do for you I mean in a sense that's true
01:22:17 yeah in a sense did you
01:22:19 this is how I knew I was fucking in
01:22:21 way back in like out in like
01:22:23 2013 you had
01:22:25 a ton of Skype friends you're like alright I need to purge
01:22:27 all these people because of fucking Maslow's
01:22:29 or some fucking bullshit
01:22:31 oh because of Dunbar's number yeah yeah
01:22:33 that's hilarious yeah yeah
01:22:35 I definitely exceeded it by like three times
01:22:37 yeah so you're like alright I need to scrape all these people
01:22:39 off and so you did that and I was clenching
01:22:41 my my asshole was tucked
01:22:43 and my balls were fluffed
01:22:45 and I was waiting
01:22:47 and I was waiting and then like like it turned
01:22:49 past midnight I knew that I was fucking in
01:22:51 and I was singing something like weird fucked up
01:22:53 video like haha nice one munchie
01:22:55 I was like yeah I'm his friend
01:22:57 I'm his fucking friend
01:22:59 I'm his fucking friend
01:23:01 got him
01:23:03 manipulated
01:23:05 emotionally fucking manipulated
01:23:07 got him
01:23:09 that's hell yeah
01:23:11 that's the way to do it
01:23:13 the only difference
01:23:15 between those munchies stand right there
01:23:17 and what most people do is that most people just don't think
01:23:19 about it enough to realize they're emotionally manipulating
01:23:21 people yeah because everybody does that
01:23:23 shit whether you think about it or not it's just
01:23:25 you know how you choose to phrase it
01:23:27 I mean that's what communication is
01:23:29 like you always choose to
01:23:31 represent your best self to people you know
01:23:33 which is the same shit it's the same shit so
01:23:35 you know
01:23:37 what about those lists though you had a list or something
01:23:39 what's going on with that
01:23:41 it's been stupid
01:23:43 family or friends where do you value more
01:23:45 yeah yeah I was going to say
01:23:47 in high school I remember I was
01:23:49 okay because I really hated my parents
01:23:51 my damn parents in high school
01:23:53 was making me do it oh my
01:23:55 what
01:23:57 what
01:23:59 what
01:24:01 what
01:24:03 what
01:24:05 what
01:24:07 shut up
01:24:09 I was really angsty as a teen
01:24:11 you still are
01:24:13 I'm getting to that
01:24:15 and I was really angsty as a teen and I was like
01:24:17 man I hate my family I didn't choose
01:24:19 these people I chose my friends
01:24:21 friends
01:24:23 I don't care about my friends I like my friends better
01:24:25 than my family because I chose my friends but you know
01:24:27 I sure I was an angsty teen but I mean that's
01:24:29 true you know like the people
01:24:31 you're friends with are the people that you choose
01:24:33 to be friends with and I think that's
01:24:35 cool I think that makes
01:24:37 really important because you're like you know
01:24:39 you're kind of defining yourself by who you choose
01:24:41 to be friends with absolutely and that's important to people
01:24:43 especially for kids I think one of the
01:24:45 best things you can learn
01:24:47 to grow as a person is to know
01:24:49 that the best way to become friends
01:24:51 with somebody is to be better
01:24:53 at what they do than they are
01:24:55 so that they're impressed by you that's true that was your
01:24:57 philosophy when you met us basically back in the day
01:24:59 some degree
01:25:01 I totally agree with that philosophy
01:25:03 and that's a lot of the people
01:25:05 who I seek out online to this day
01:25:07 are generally people who do
01:25:09 usually
01:25:11 similar content to me but that I think
01:25:13 are really good at it either as
01:25:15 good or better than me and that like
01:25:17 as time goes on and I'm less
01:25:19 and less impressed with people who are doing like
01:25:21 not impressive work
01:25:23 like at this point I want you to act
01:25:25 like you have to be at least
01:25:27 even better than I am for me to even
01:25:29 like turn my head because
01:25:31 like you know I want to see stuff
01:25:33 that like I want to surround myself with
01:25:35 people who are going to push me to be even better
01:25:37 it's just the thing that
01:25:39 I hate the most in life is entitlement
01:25:41 and especially
01:25:43 I mean where it's relevant to this is friendship entitlement
01:25:45 and it's like people who message
01:25:47 you and like expect
01:25:49 you to message back okay I know I've said this before
01:25:51 in a way but it's like I literally
01:25:53 consider it a form of violence
01:25:55 that you're perpetuating on me
01:25:57 if you message me
01:25:59 if you message me and then get mad
01:26:01 if you just say hey
01:26:03 if you just give me the hey and then you're like
01:26:05 well what the fuck why didn't you message me back
01:26:07 motherfucker I've been waiting two weeks
01:26:09 I said hey
01:26:11 let me tell a story real quick
01:26:13 it's just I want to
01:26:15 shit talk this person in my life from years ago
01:26:17 make sure you mention Star Trek because I have to piss
01:26:19 and it's around 55 minute mark
01:26:21 you're right it's time to get to Star Trek
01:26:23 in high school back when I still used Facebook
01:26:25 after I left high school and I was in college
01:26:27 there was a girl who had
01:26:29 like a crush on me in high school who
01:26:31 she messaged me like once
01:26:33 I mean I never checked my Facebook even back then when I had
01:26:35 was she into the vampire hunter D aesthetic
01:26:37 yeah she was into like the long hair
01:26:39 like sexy choir boy thing that I was doing
01:26:41 was it that girl who would draw like comics
01:26:43 and put you on? no no that was that was Jillian
01:26:45 that's a different person it was not Jillian
01:26:47 Jillian was alright we were kind of friends
01:26:49 this is another girl
01:26:51 she was Carrie her name was Carrie
01:26:53 and just like I Carrie
01:26:55 my team in League of Legends
01:26:57 and listen
01:26:59 so she did this thing where she messaged me on
01:27:01 Facebook just sent me a private message
01:27:03 just being like hey how you been that was like a year
01:27:05 after I left and was in college I just ignored it
01:27:07 but oh I forgot
01:27:09 she could see that I had read the message
01:27:11 on Facebook they can do that
01:27:13 so that means you never read your message
01:27:15 but this is my first experience with that
01:27:17 and basically the point is just that
01:27:19 several months after
01:27:21 that initial message where I saw it
01:27:23 and I just didn't respond I get a huge
01:27:25 wall of text saying how mad
01:27:27 this person isn't me for
01:27:29 not responding to that and like I think
01:27:31 why you think you're so much better than me
01:27:33 you think you're like you're above talking
01:27:35 to these people they're you know talking to me and like the old
01:27:37 people who you grew up with like what the fuck
01:27:39 is that about dude um
01:27:41 and of course I just didn't respond
01:27:43 I mean she saw that I read it again
01:27:45 but I didn't respond and then I think another
01:27:47 six months later so I get another message
01:27:49 that's just like hey I want to let you know
01:27:51 I'm really sorry about that last message like you know
01:27:53 I'm just having you know I just didn't really want to
01:27:55 I really want to touch base like I wanted to connect
01:27:57 but like listen you're asking
01:27:59 for something from me I don't know
01:28:01 you shit I don't know anybody
01:28:03 shit I don't know anybody communication
01:28:05 other than like I don't know
01:28:07 like my parents or my friends were like waiting
01:28:09 for something like right now that I promised I would
01:28:11 give them like a message back or whatever
01:28:13 and if you expect that
01:28:15 there was a problem with
01:28:17 you and I think a lot of people have that kind of
01:28:19 entitlement um and it disgusts
01:28:21 me deeply that's how I feel let me let me
01:28:23 tell you creepypasta right now yeah
01:28:25 get on me you get
01:28:27 a message there's the creepypasta
01:28:29 no
01:28:31 no
01:28:33 no get away all right get back
01:28:35 up you're fucking up the camera
01:28:37 oh god
01:28:39 okay Jesus fucking
01:28:41 he's committed
01:28:43 it's not real
01:28:45 someone messages you
01:28:47 on discord
01:28:49 they're like hey how you doing
01:28:51 you don't want to respond
01:28:53 then then then you like leave it
01:28:55 and then three minutes later you get the message
01:28:57 hmm are you there
01:28:59 are you there
01:29:01 are you there
01:29:03 hey are you there

01:29:15 that yes I have
01:29:17 got it and fuck you
01:29:19 and die
01:29:21 I don't want to talk to you is the reason I haven't
01:29:23 responded to you uh yeah that's right people need
01:29:25 to recognize that sometimes people don't want to
01:29:27 fucking talk to you uh and you know most
01:29:29 people do but it's just it's just these edge
01:29:31 cases you know these edging cases that I deal
01:29:33 with a lot in my day to day life and it's just
01:29:35 these joking cases
01:29:37 um yeah I don't know
01:29:39 we got uh are we
01:29:41 done more lists should we should we do
01:29:43 uh oh yeah
01:29:45 read the last one
01:29:47 I just want to add to the things that I
01:29:49 look for in people yeah all of my
01:29:51 best friends throughout my entire
01:29:53 life have been short
01:29:55 white people with brownish hair who get
01:29:57 really mad when they suck shit at video
01:29:59 games which they suck shit at everybody
01:30:03 I don't get that mad when I suck shit at video games
01:30:05 you're not my best friend
01:30:07 but I do suck shit at all
01:30:09 so do you mean just Ethan or something
01:30:11 so did you mean just you're like number one
01:30:13 yeah number one
01:30:15 what's the trend here
01:30:17 like three I think
01:30:19 that's good enough
01:30:21 uh friends
01:30:23 I want my friends
01:30:25 to believe in me
01:30:27 that's important but friend doesn't believe in me
01:30:29 well we're all out that's it for us
01:30:31 goodbye everyone
01:30:33 but I don't want them to believe in me too much
01:30:35 you know well like to the point where
01:30:37 they're too nice okay and they don't fucking
01:30:39 call me when I do something hard
01:30:41 do you mean specifically believe in you
01:30:43 or believe you no I mean like believe
01:30:45 in me and like have faith in my abilities
01:30:47 and like you know like okay I want
01:30:49 them to think that I can accomplish my
01:30:51 goals but not so much that they think
01:30:53 that I'm infallible but but of course I'm sure you
01:30:55 recognize that it is basically it's due
01:30:57 they will determine
01:30:59 you know at runtime in real life
01:31:01 whether or not you are likely to determine
01:31:03 your goals based on your performance
01:31:05 I guess so it's really you I guess maybe it's more
01:31:07 on me but I don't know I don't think I'd want to be
01:31:09 friends with someone who was like this guy's
01:31:11 I think what you're saying I mean
01:31:13 why would this person choose to be friends with me
01:31:15 if he thinks I'm a fuck up and he thinks I suck
01:31:17 well the thing is I think it's more than like
01:31:19 um people I want I want people
01:31:21 to be supportive of my goals
01:31:23 because like if I'm like constantly
01:31:25 proving like I can't do them that's fine but like if I
01:31:27 say like oh so what do you want to do I'm like
01:31:29 oh I want to make comics like that's gay
01:31:31 like I don't I don't want that kind of person around me
01:31:33 I mean if you're like I want to make comics
01:31:35 you haven't done that you need to do better
01:31:37 you need to actually that's fine yeah that's good
01:31:39 that's that's called being real I mean
01:31:41 because it's about being a good friend
01:31:43 I think and I think a good friend would do would
01:31:45 hopefully do something like say
01:31:47 listen if your friend says like dude I've decided
01:31:49 I'm going to be
01:31:51 I'm going to be a fucking pottery
01:31:53 pottery maker
01:31:55 I'm gonna I'm gonna make a million dollars making the best
01:31:57 pottery in the world and then you could sit there
01:31:59 and be like well hey man that's great I encourage you
01:32:01 to be like I support you I'm your friend I support you
01:32:03 or you could be what I would consider
01:32:05 a superior friend and say I'm a fucking fag
01:32:07 I'm a fucking fag no you say uh okay
01:32:09 um so what's what's the economic
01:32:11 realities of being a famous pottery man
01:32:13 like how are you gonna pay off the loans you're gonna
01:32:15 have to take to go to school yeah what is your plan
01:32:17 walk me through this that's exactly
01:32:19 what everyone should do you shouldn't say listen
01:32:21 my end goal is to be a pottery maker
01:32:23 therefore I will
01:32:25 just aim for that and figure it out
01:32:27 as I go because that's a recipe for disaster folks
01:32:29 that's how we got the kind of
01:32:31 student debt that America is in right now
01:32:33 what you got to do is have the full plan
01:32:35 for and if you fuck up along the way
01:32:37 here's the thing if you don't want to be a dick
01:32:39 in the process of doing that just just do like
01:32:41 our boy Aristotle did and just ask questions
01:32:43 and let them dig their own grave or blow your mind
01:32:45 with this crazy plan it's like oh
01:32:47 you convinced me that's right that's right so
01:32:49 yeah
01:32:51 uh was that your last note there Ben
01:32:53 I think I have one more okay okay
01:32:55 um
01:32:57 um
01:32:59 Ben eats during the podcast
01:33:01 saying there it is everybody
01:33:03 would you have your vape can you vape into the mic
01:33:05 can you vape in the house you can't smoke in the house
01:33:07 oh I'll get it in a second
01:33:09 I'll get it in a second um
01:33:11 it's just vapors not smoke if you're friends
01:33:13 so
01:33:15 I think it's really important that friends should be able to tell
01:33:17 each other
01:33:19 no
01:33:23 stream you can't see it but Victor's expression
01:33:25 right now is
01:33:27 maniacal
01:33:29 all of the Collins
01:33:31 when they get that specific mood and look
01:33:33 like literal goblins
01:33:37 they look like literal
01:33:41 zoom in on this
01:33:43 zoom in on it why don't you just look at it
01:33:45 oh yeah there he is
01:33:47 the camera
01:33:49 yeah
01:33:51 thank you
01:33:53 okay back to the
01:33:55 action all right back to the food
01:33:57 I really think it's important that friends should be able
01:33:59 to criticize each other Ben stop eating
01:34:01 on the fucking dream
01:34:03 yeah
01:34:05 um and tell each other when they think you're
01:34:07 fucked up yeah okay right agreed
01:34:09 agreed and it shouldn't be a friendship ender
01:34:11 and if it is in your friendship
01:34:13 probably success
01:34:15 yeah though I mean oh to be fair it's not like
01:34:17 if friends just come at you
01:34:19 with constant negativity about your life
01:34:21 that's I mean if they don't have like
01:34:23 if they're if someone's like there's two ways to do it like dude
01:34:25 your shit sucks you're gay I fucking hate you get
01:34:27 die as opposed to like listen
01:34:29 dude
01:34:31 I mean that's a good friend right there but another approach you can take is
01:34:33 you know of course like hey listen dude
01:34:35 I respect your goals but listen
01:34:37 I'm seriously concerned about you because
01:34:39 I'm not sure the economic realities this thing work out
01:34:41 you know just as what I think about
01:34:43 so I mean
01:34:45 have you thought about this you know to probe in this shit
01:34:47 yeah there he is there's my boy

01:37:31 I don't know my life but I'm willing to try
01:37:33 oh I don't know
01:37:35 this is not a good idea
01:37:37 you'll destroy the space
01:37:39 I could do a somersault
01:37:41 or a car
01:37:43 a single jump
01:37:45 focus on my feet
01:37:47 woo
01:37:49 pcp 100
01:37:51 I know I can't do a backflip
01:37:53 alright there he goes
01:37:55 this is the best we got
01:37:57 alright
01:37:59 I'm gonna hurt myself
01:38:01 you're good
01:38:03 careful you're good
01:38:05 yeah
01:38:07 alright well done
01:38:09 fuck yeah
01:38:11 okay well we got everybody
01:38:13 I hope that was worth 20 dicks
01:38:15 I hope that was worth 50 dutch
01:38:17 dutch kronen
01:38:19 we got champagne
01:38:21 our good graph
01:38:23 killing good games
01:38:25 our good graphics killing good games
01:38:27 I spelt so wrong
01:38:29 yeah cause budgets
01:38:31 spiraling budgets
01:38:33 okay but here's a question though
01:38:35 is there any way to avoid it
01:38:37 stop giving a shit about graphics
01:38:39 stop being a coward
01:38:41 stop being a coward and embrace
01:38:43 stylistic restrictions
01:38:45 the indie market has proved that there are buyers for those games
01:38:47 that's true
01:38:49 triple A is just in its own world though
01:38:51 well that's why triple A is gay
01:38:53 if people stopped
01:38:55 getting a constant stream
01:38:57 of photorealistic games
01:38:59 then people would stop
01:39:01 this is why I have no pity
01:39:03 for these companies
01:39:05 oh god games are so expensive now guys
01:39:07 you are the ones who developed the
01:39:09 let's make everything photorealistic
01:39:11 mentality that wasn't on the people
01:39:13 that was you saying we're just gonna keep releasing new hardware
01:39:15 every couple years we keep milking you mother fuckers
01:39:17 I mean it's a complex thing like you're saying
01:39:19 cause it's a reciprocal cyclical
01:39:21 cyclical process of people
01:39:23 you could kind of blame for a lot of it
01:39:25 it was the shift of emphasis
01:39:27 towards spectacle
01:39:29 well that was just like the console
01:39:31 I mean everyone was doing that the Sega Saturn
01:39:33 the Playstation 1
01:39:35 it's a lot of other super changes
01:39:37 it's been 100 episodes
01:39:39 how much more must we endure
01:39:41 you can stop watching it
01:39:43 as long as you have things to say
01:39:45 the PCB shall endure
01:39:47 King Cobra asks Munchie are you gonna do more vids
01:39:49 like the Jace one
01:39:51 do they mean
01:39:53 more lectures
01:39:55 you'll definitely be doing another lecture
01:39:57 more lectures in the future
01:39:59 if he means more lectures then yes
01:40:01 we'll be doing one this time
01:40:03 and if you mean more Jace videos
01:40:05 as in like performing a character
01:40:07 then that's all my content so yes
01:40:09 Tyler the Fancy says
01:40:11 you'll be releasing the D&D session
01:40:13 recorded at this year's Radcon soon
01:40:15 I brought that up just a minute ago
01:40:17 and no one could have possibly heard it
01:40:19 so this must
01:40:21 wait what sorry what was it
01:40:23 Ben was talking about potentially doing a Dungeons & Dragons
01:40:25 I thought you hate Dungeons & Dragons
01:40:27 I do but I do it anyway
01:40:29 we can do a D&D redemption stream
01:40:31 or something
01:40:33 I wouldn't do D&D but I might find like a rules light
01:40:35 like a game system
01:40:37 the whole stuff thing we did was way more fun
01:40:39 well it doesn't have to be that
01:40:41 we can look into it
01:40:43 I actually have looked into it before
01:40:45 but then I dropped it but now that we're here
01:40:47 Ben I've always wanted
01:40:49 to fucking have a homestuck D&D
01:40:51 I've always wanted to do that
01:40:53 I'm gonna do that now but I've always wanted to have that happen
01:40:55 listen to this comment MattLand
01:40:57 super chat thanks buddy
01:40:59 how did Ben get so thick if he is so poor
01:41:01 keep it real my dudes
01:41:03 don't let Tom forget my shirt
01:41:05 what do you think Ben? I eat all carbs
01:41:07 that's the trick everybody
01:41:09 I'm healthy I'm eating all carb diet
01:41:11 Saad Hassan wants you to pull off a sick
01:41:13 celebratory cloud of vape
01:41:15 here we go
01:41:17 here we go
01:41:19 J-HeartBs asks opinions on fans
01:41:21 i.e. me
01:41:23 obviously we need
01:41:25 yeah there she goes
01:41:31 it's like the Ben move today
01:41:33 it's pretty good
01:41:35 he screams to cover
01:41:37 his discomfort of being on camera
01:41:39 yeah and it's not really covering anything
01:41:41 because she's playing his day
01:41:43 Giffy from the patreon lounge
01:41:45 asks where's the best meme created
01:41:47 well so far we're not even like
01:41:49 it's too soon to say
01:41:51 yeah it's too soon to say
01:41:53 but so far it has to go to my vain
01:41:55 man Dan
01:41:57 Dan soft toilet seats
01:41:59 oh by the way I've been liking this
01:42:01 don't mind at night a lot though
01:42:03 is that a new thing
01:42:05 when did that happen
01:42:07 first time I heard it was in the car
01:42:09 as most memes start
01:42:11 for some reason just said don't mind
01:42:13 at night and then it just you know
01:42:15 might just be bringing out the horse
01:42:17 songs all the way
01:42:19 I'm sorry my voice
01:42:21 this guy's man is pure discord
01:42:23 howling at it
01:42:25 viewers I put my body
01:42:27 through such physical stress
01:42:29 and mental harm directly for you
01:42:31 you hear this you hear that
01:42:33 that's my voice going fucking up
01:42:35 except for screaming every single
01:42:37 fucking video non stop
01:42:39 this godforsaken hellhole
01:42:41 I do it for you
01:42:43 I do it for you viewers I'm full in
01:42:45 fuck yeah Rad God 3
01:42:47 I'll blow out my fucking purse
01:42:49 I'll blow out my hearse
01:42:51 I'll blow out my fucking grave for you
01:42:53 ever since we all hashtag entered the arena
01:42:55 we've all been spiraling downward and by the way
01:42:57 the final player has logged in
01:42:59 has a bit like you know
01:43:01 when you're on an MMO and you're waiting for my people to load in
01:43:03 to join your server
01:43:05 all the players have now assembled in our server
01:43:07 for Rad Country IRL
01:43:09 so the game will begin soon
01:43:11 all we need to do is press fucking F4
01:43:13 to ready up and we will be fucking in that way
01:43:15 my boy we will be in that way
01:43:17 also we should like hard sell Dan toilets
01:43:19 really quick by the way because as we
01:43:21 as we've stated before this is
01:43:23 literally like the perfect incarnation of
01:43:25 why we need PCPHQ
01:43:27 because that video could not
01:43:29 exist in any form
01:43:31 if it weren't for being here
01:43:33 go watch DanSop
01:43:35 open letter to DanSop toilet seat on this channel
01:43:37 if you haven't seen it
01:43:39 that was all improbable
01:43:41 why are you encroaching over giving so hard core
01:43:43 DanSop toilets
01:43:45 it could not happen
01:43:47 because we can't do that over voice
01:43:49 this was a pure in person thing
01:43:51 and this kind of stuff would happen all the time
01:43:53 would be even better if we were in PCPHQ
01:43:55 so please you'll get content like
01:43:57 DanSop toilets
01:43:59 but even better probably even written
01:44:01 meaning that you're doing skits now
01:44:03 I wanted to mention that like
01:44:05 doing this has made me very comfortable
01:44:07 with the
01:44:09 we're in the middle of that
01:44:11 damn pocket
01:44:13 he's having trouble logging into account so he can't do it
01:44:15 well anyway
01:44:17 I think that this has proved the
01:44:19 functionality of the idea of
01:44:21 like a
01:44:23 PCPHQ because for me the experience
01:44:25 has been what it would be because I've been
01:44:27 leaving every night and coming every day
01:44:29 you know like from a hotel
01:44:31 and yeah the idea of just being
01:44:33 able to like drive 10 minutes
01:44:35 up the road and like create
01:44:37 shit and then just go home is really
01:44:39 nice that is the dream ultimately
01:44:41 and uh yeah
01:44:43 you know I mean I just want I
01:44:45 look forward I really look forward to having the
01:44:47 content all out and having
01:44:49 the audience cast judgment on whether
01:44:51 or not we have fulfilled our job
01:44:53 and I think we absolutely will but I
01:44:55 want the people to confirm that they are
01:44:57 happy with what we have delivered
01:44:59 I have to read these chats before they disappear
01:45:01 if the PCP was a band
01:45:03 what instrument would each member play
01:45:05 trumpet I already have a trumpet I plan to learn
01:45:07 how to play the trumpet because I really like the trumpet that I plan to do that
01:45:09 soon it kind of fucking broke but
01:45:11 I'll fix it
01:45:13 I play guitar
01:45:15 I sing and I play the clarinet
01:45:17 I pick that back up
01:45:19 I play jazz clarinet that's right
01:45:21 oh
01:45:23 I'd be the guy just managing
01:45:25 the sound boards and like causing feedback
01:45:27 you'd be the DJ like an incubus
01:45:29 you know the designated DJ
01:45:31 I'm thinking a little bit more like
01:45:33 Brian Eno or something but
01:45:35 sure I can be the incubus fucking
01:45:37 they've got a designated DJ
01:45:39 in their band I mean Lincoln Park has one too
01:45:41 they were probably inspired by them
01:45:43 I do actually play the saxophone
01:45:45 but I think that playing the saxophone
01:45:47 is a good encapsulation of who I
01:45:49 am you are a good singer
01:45:51 because I would be there I'm there
01:45:53 I don't really need to be there
01:45:55 but it's quirky
01:45:57 and everyone likes it when you are
01:45:59 what about Tom you play anything
01:46:01 cowbell
01:46:03 and here's something I don't understand
01:46:05 but maybe you do William Baker for $5
01:46:07 that's what is the sexiest fundamental force
01:46:11 what's that new one
01:46:13 oh it's gotta be the color force
01:46:15 the color force?
01:46:17 is that like the speed force?
01:46:19 no that's the strong
01:46:21 the one between the one between
01:46:23 shout out your favorite content creator who isn't in the PCP
01:46:25 does that have to be from
01:46:27 Dr. Wolf
01:46:29 he didn't even say it had to be
01:46:31 YouTuber it's just content creator
01:46:33 Dr. Wolf
01:46:35 of all creators of all time
01:46:37 all of my favorite content creators
01:46:39 not in the PCP are either
01:46:41 inactive or
01:46:43 like most of my favorites
01:46:45 like Andrew Hussey and Yannar and Kallinsky
01:46:47 I would call them my favorites but
01:46:49 it's not like they update them
01:46:51 yeah so let's go through my
01:46:53 descriptions and see
01:46:55 what about you give
01:46:57 he's a good boy
01:46:59 I have a deep place in my heart
01:47:01 for Twin Perfect
01:47:03 I also love Demolition D
01:47:05 that's enough for now
01:47:07 Scooby 1961
01:47:09 Fitness Guy on YouTube is a hero
01:47:11 Gabe and Tycho from Penny Arcade
01:47:13 not cause I love the comic
01:47:15 but I love
01:47:17 their empire
01:47:19 I love the indie stuff
01:47:21 is it just the empire itself
01:47:23 I love their podcast and I love the empire
01:47:25 and I love their whole attitude
01:47:27 and what they do and I wish I was them
01:47:29 I love the freakish trollish bodies
01:47:31 yeah I love how
01:47:33 Tycho looks like a boiled egg
01:47:35 yeah he sure does
01:47:37 we're still going here
01:47:39 my answer would probably be Dick Masterson
01:47:41 just you know I'm
01:47:43 fucking obsessed with this show and I've learned
01:47:45 I feel like I've learned a lot about how
01:47:47 to think of
01:47:49 how to just think about the world from him
01:47:51 in terms of protecting yourself
01:47:53 and just not being fucked with
01:47:55 and having a very aggressive attitude
01:47:57 towards your surroundings
01:47:59 you know
01:48:01 I've looked through my descriptions
01:48:03 I don't like any of them as much as Andrew has
01:48:05 I was going to say M.D.E
01:48:07 but from my perspective
01:48:09 I found out of M.D.D.
01:48:11 through Yandering Katsuki
01:48:13 which just kind of feels like a subset of
01:48:15 it's a million dollar extreme
01:48:17 yeah a million dollar extreme
01:48:19 Charles Carroll and Nick Roachford
01:48:21 I mean I like them
01:48:23 I think they're good
01:48:25 but they're not Parkour Druid 91
01:48:27 they don't fucking sing Weed Eater
01:48:29 they don't sing Weed Eater
01:48:31 that's what I care about
01:48:33 Tom how about you
01:48:35 I'm gonna have to go with M.D.E.P.
01:48:37 by the way can I give one shout out to
01:48:39 Jan Productions
01:48:41 who made that public PSA do not mind at night
01:48:43 so many
01:48:45 asks do you have any Boston specific
01:48:47 plans aside from content
01:48:49 killing Gibbon take
01:48:51 going to a specific restaurant a museum
01:48:53 finding a burial spot
01:48:55 on home soil for Ben
01:48:57 well
01:48:59 I'm gonna go
01:49:01 house hunting and I think I'm gonna take
01:49:03 Munchy and Gaze
01:49:05 with me
01:49:07 okay cool
01:49:09 hang out in Boston
01:49:11 plans that will be fulfilled here at Radcom
01:49:13 because I want to stay here at Radcom for all of my
01:49:15 you know most of my stuff
01:49:17 but there are points that I want to take these guys
01:49:19 eventually I have a lot of ideas
01:49:21 I want to take them to fucking Newbury Street
01:49:23 I want to take them to fucking everywhere
01:49:25 on fucking Boston just the entire fucking road
01:49:27 the common obviously Faniel Hall
01:49:29 I want to do the walk that I did
01:49:31 just the other day walking Faniel Hall to the ICA
01:49:33 fucking ICA will blow
01:49:35 you two right there you two fucking schmucks
01:49:37 would love the
01:49:39 jipper air you would blow your fucking load
01:49:41 I've never been
01:49:43 Russell has emerged back
01:49:45 from the black
01:49:47 he's asking has my
01:49:49 royal rumble form been achieved yet
01:49:51 yes yes I have
01:49:53 I saw it with my own eyes
01:49:55 he has been materialized from the dark evil
01:49:57 Pokemon hell
01:49:59 you are really gonna fucking like it
01:50:01 I think
01:50:03 we did good
01:50:05 I was like yeah
01:50:07 why do you guys call things gay all the time
01:50:09 why?
01:50:11 we're gay
01:50:13 it's because we're all gay
01:50:15 we understand the nuance
01:50:17 because I can think of no greater insult than
01:50:19 saying you're just like me
01:50:21 you ever had one that you're like
01:50:23 afraid to read because you're gonna have

01:51:16 Look into the fate system of role-playing it's more role-playing less rule-focused and character creation is pretty
01:51:24 I think it's not related. I don't think it's related to fate stay night. I don't think it is
01:51:33 Anyone of you have had any of you had a paranormal experience. Yes
01:51:37 On the ghost episode where where I was a little baby when I was a little feeling the sun was going down
01:51:42 I was just I was just like walking on my soul. So we're mining at night
01:51:49 And there was I just saw something like weird shadowy fucking like like shadow man figure and I ran downstairs crying
01:51:55 It was super scary, but it was cool. So was I on the ghost cast
01:51:58 I think I was and I might have told this story, so I'll tell it very quickly
01:52:02 But my college was like had a reputation freeing haunted as many do and we went on like early when I first enrolled
01:52:09 we went on like a ghost tour and
01:52:11 They they took us around to some haunted spots and we went up to some room and there was supposedly a ghost there and
01:52:17 There was like a flash. No someone flashed a camera and I saw in the camera flash in the window
01:52:22 I saw what looked like people I saw a
01:52:24 An old man in a poncho and a little boy and I was like, oh cool ghost
01:52:29 I was like, hey, I just saw a ghost in the window
01:52:31 It was an old man on a poncho little boy and the guy was like, no no no the ghost here is a woman
01:52:40 And then some goth girl was like, oh I felt something because I have spiritual powers and I was like
01:52:47 Yeah
01:52:49 She got touched on the butt by a ghost because she was sitting on a haunted radiator
01:52:52 And that was my paranormal experience Paris Pickle followed up on the kiss. Thanks for the kiss hippo. I am actually a woman crying
01:53:11 Hey, here's a thing Mars Lou Mars Louise Evans says name your favorite hentai Joe Jin Chi
01:53:19 I'm gonna go with shout-out to acid head just all their work with one piece of Naruto
01:53:24 They got big tits. They got big sluts. They got everything you could want everybody
01:53:29 They put they's the same one every single time. So if you don't like it, then you're not
01:53:35 Yeah, it's a dojin
01:53:36 My circle wait, no, no, they said just what's it? What's what's a dojin?
01:53:42 She and what's not a fan work if it's been released if it's not like published by a major publisher
01:53:48 I don't know. I don't know. It doesn't have to be hentai. Well, they asked for a hentai one. Okay. Well, my favorite is probably
01:53:54 Chinpoko sama, which is about this
01:53:58 Unfathomably hot girl who gets who summons a gigantic penis monster in the night to fuck her and eat her and it's cool
01:54:06 I went and read that one. Yeah, you talked about it. It works really fucking beautiful creep me out because she like dies in the end
01:54:13 Yeah
01:54:17 Doesn't make it
01:54:22 Metamorphosis
01:54:27 For metamorphosis, yeah, I would I would like a copy of metamorphosis. It's just it's a cultural touchstone
01:54:33 Well, what is it? Oh, it's a it's a dojin about like an okay
01:54:36 It's a portrait of the stupidest girl who ever lived basically. She's a she's a kind of nerdy girl
01:54:42 She gets a makeover and then all of a sudden everyone's super attracted to her and she ends up just like
01:54:47 Because she can't handle like the attention
01:54:49 She starts just like fucking everyone and then nobody wants to like hang out with her
01:54:52 She becomes like a bicycle everybody hates her and then her life just spiral like everybody hates her now because she's a slut
01:54:57 She like meets a guy who likes her. He like drugs her and fucks her and just gets wrapped up in this whole thing
01:55:02 Her father rapes her. It's this whole big
01:55:05 She got her mom is mad at her for the dad raping her and thinks she's a slut
01:55:08 She kicks her out of the house and she's she goes to that boyfriend who I'd like fucked her obviously doesn't care about her
01:55:13 That guy starts using her for like prostitution
01:55:16 He just keeps giving her drugs so she doesn't care and she just spirals down from there
01:55:20 She becomes homeless sure it's fucking a lot of homeless people
01:55:23 Just to like survive and eventually she gets she's pregnant
01:55:26 She has an abortion that happens again
01:55:28 and then she gets kicked to death by a bunch of urban youth in Tokyo and then she dies and the final thing we see is
01:55:35 Like a little flash to like what her life is like her with her daughter like 20 years later
01:55:39 But actually that's a dream and she died drugged and like fucking pregnant being stomped death by teenagers on a public bathroom floor
01:55:52 It is actually terrible and like
01:55:56 It's a good story for what it is
01:55:59 Oh my god
01:56:00 On the opposite of the spectrum
01:56:02 The hentai that made me that gave me the biggest laugh like which I think is worth a lot of points
01:56:09 Say say so say so to eat on shot. Hmm is really funny
01:56:15 It's not even like it's not even like my thing at all like it's like it's like femdom bullying stuff
01:56:22 It's like that's not really
01:56:25 But it's got this the premises that the kids dick
01:56:28 Magically can detach and then it can magically like reattach to other things including like girls can like put it on themselves
01:56:34 And so these like bully girls like pass this dick around and it's it's just really funny and it's the arts really good
01:56:41 Ending is hilarious
01:56:47 For me to record a Vic vlog so I did Victor if you would like to
01:56:52 They asked for shirtless Victor
01:57:07 Why Victor is shirtless you want to comment on that at all Victor
01:57:16 Digi bros fan black one blade asks how is Vic and hope doing?
01:57:22 Oh

01:57:40 We're pretty much out of super chance, do we just want to like end? Oh, well, let me get a Twitter
01:57:45 Let me get the Twitter
01:57:49 Let's put in the hashtag
01:57:52 The patreon lounge read some patreon lounge ones. They're all
01:57:56 Come on. Let's read a horrible one. Let's read a horrible
01:58:04 Exactly who would be dead now this was the Stone Age with cavemen
01:58:08 That's the worst question ever
01:58:11 I mean, we'd all be dead
01:58:18 With caveman embarrassing
01:58:22 Was that let's let's rag on them crafty crafty stop
01:58:27 I thought had to be intentionally bad. There's no way. Oh, no, these questions are good though
01:58:33 If the Hunger Games style competition starting the PCB house right now
01:58:38 Which PCP member would come out on top shout out to my boy a faku no Alvarez. Yeah, when we do the the arena
01:58:45 That's true. He's right about that. It's basically exactly the entire purpose
01:58:50 Okay, okay
01:58:53 I've got a good I got one. That's a missed super chat that was then sent by my fan into my discord
01:58:59 Okay, what do you guys if you end up checking discord this week, please ask them my question
01:59:03 Which was how much does Ben spend on vape stuff per month?
01:59:07 I had a bunch of mods that these are really cheap mods and I had like two of them that broke in rapid succession
01:59:13 So it was kind of an unusual time
01:59:15 But in general, I would probably say I might spend like that's not the same pipe that you had at my house
01:59:21 Is it it's a new version of it's a new model?
01:59:24 Yeah version 2.0
01:59:26 It's the same make. I probably buy like a bottle of juice probably like 30 much better than your previous
01:59:33 For maybe like $30 and that usually they'll probably
01:59:37 a month or
01:59:40 $30 none of this
01:59:44 We have a question. Yes from lethal rora mage
01:59:49 Where is mage? Well, I'll tell I'll tell you boys. She is right here. Oh fuck
01:59:58 Mage
02:00:09 Yeah
02:00:19 It's so great to see you I'm so 100 how fucking hype are you I
02:00:30 Without you fucking what do you have to say?
02:00:40 You guys you are getting rad content not even at the fucking house rad con is the fucking crucible of Christ
02:00:48 Can we get can we get mage for Radcon 4 can we
02:00:52 Had plans to get mage in for Radcon 3 that unfortunately didn't work out
02:00:55 But we will put our best effort in to make sure that mage can be around for the next one
02:00:59 So, yeah, I really want to I hope so
02:01:03 Yeah
02:01:06 Yeah, she'll just wear like a purple
02:01:15 Let's let's ask a question to mage. Yeah, here we go. You're from the Twitter our pity question
02:01:26 Maze why would I question so bad? Here's a question. That's relevant for you. No, I'm sorry. This is too embarrassing to read
02:01:32 I can't do it
02:01:33 This one
02:01:36 It's loading
02:01:38 Is because it doesn't know the whole thing is jealousy slash envy for a friend a good thing as in a
02:01:44 Motivator to become better or more successful or doesn't rather make you unmotivated instead. What's your take mage?
02:01:52 You mean in general or personally for me, I guess for you I guess for you
02:01:58 I
02:01:59 Don't get jealous necessarily have friends, but I guess it technically motivates me
02:02:05 I usually take whenever I if I ever get like jealous or any yes
02:02:09 I just motivate myself to get better so I wouldn't have to feel that way. Okay. I'm jealous of your ability to not be jealous
02:02:16 All right. Got one more question for you. Listen to this mage. Is there any exotic dish?
02:02:21 I know you're a food connoisseur that you've wanted to eat. Oh, this is from at XG upload by the way
02:02:26 Is there any exotic dish you want to eat but you're too much of a pussy to eat it
02:02:40 You know
02:02:44 That's more of wanting to be a lie
02:02:50 I would eat that shit
02:02:53 Yeah
02:03:03 I mean it's Twitter, so they're all bad
02:03:08 Here's what we can all win on this at monkey away as this is a very complicated questions thoughts on the wild success of the PCP itself
02:03:23 Yeah, it's um, I mean I never expected it to get as big as it did but it has not felt it hasn't been like an explosive growth
02:03:29 It's been no it's been like it's felt really gradual
02:03:32 But like stepping back and looking at it. I'm like wow really got a lot bigger than I ever expected
02:03:37 Oh, it was it was very strange because the period where like we
02:03:44 Like I was editing it in the early days and then I sort of for a while
02:03:49 There was like a long period where I was editing and then like when I stopped was when I
02:03:54 got really busy with my own shit and
02:03:57 Like it was interesting because in order to you know for the episodes to get edited
02:04:01 We had to come up with like a system and everything to figure out ways to do it
02:04:04 And then it kind of became a well-oiled machine and then like I came, you know like
02:04:10 Like I've been kind of not on every episode for a little while came back and was like, huh
02:04:15 I can't help but notice that we've like like this is this is not the same as it was six months ago when I was editing it
02:04:22 like everyone's taking it way more seriously and like in the time that it that like
02:04:28 Like everything else is the PCP what you put in what you get out like be the reason that the PCB has been way more successful
02:04:34 Is that we've all been working way harder on it. That's true. And especially now after the episode that shall not be named
02:04:42 monsters
02:04:44 Monsters to is coming by the way
02:04:47 Transition into a real fan
02:04:49 We've all made it concerted up. We've taken feedback and we've been listening to people's concerns and we've really been trying to make it better
02:04:55 I think we've done a lot
02:04:57 Made a Magna Carta of the reasons why the PCB is shit, which we are not gonna read
02:05:02 But we know the criticisms and we're actually trying to make them better and and we really care about this project
02:05:08 This is not just a fucking nothing show that we do for no reason at all
02:05:11 We genuinely care for the show. We want to make it better. It's like it's like the content that we can do together
02:05:16 But we've got lots of ideas for other stuff if things get to a place above it
02:05:20 I mean, yeah, we are we are you know, we're taking we're taking things into consideration and trying to evolve the PCP show itself
02:05:27 But also like PCP as a channel. I really
02:05:31 Appreciate and and I'm excited that like, you know, like like non-main stuff
02:05:36 I mean, this is a while ago, but when me and you did the D&D things. Yeah, that was fun
02:05:40 Yeah, like things like that
02:05:41 I think we should do more like side like collaborative like non-main PCP stuff. Like yeah, that kind of really nice cop killers, huh?
02:05:50 Yeah, yeah, we're out of focus. We might like get the fuck hype for that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we've got some in the chamber
02:05:55 We got some a lot. We've got some in the chamber. That's the bullets in the chamber
02:06:02 Yeah, yeah, you might say
02:06:05 All right, well, I mean that's it for the Twitter. Thanks Twitter, everybody
02:06:08 Let me just see if there's anything
02:06:10 Let's see if there's this is your absolute fucking last
02:06:14 Let's see if we can get a dope-ass question like
02:06:19 Okay, this is not the last one Dane Dane says do you think there's anyone to get to do on a call this is not
02:06:25 We asked
02:06:30 And then the final question from Robert Floyd in the patron lounge are friends real
02:06:46 All right, maybe just an AI in this phone for example also you are all AI's in your flesh phone bodies
02:06:52 That's it. My body's finally achieved. Have we have we finished? Are we done? I think we've said all there is
