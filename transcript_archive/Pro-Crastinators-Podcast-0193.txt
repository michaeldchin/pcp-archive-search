00:00:00 Welcome, welcome, welcome, one and all to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever.
00:00:11 Dun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun-nun. We've got Tom Oliver.
00:00:15 Hello.
00:00:16 Gibbontake.
00:00:20 Radcon 4.
00:00:23 Oh no, he didn't. His best say's he spilled the beans.
00:00:26 What do you mean Radcon 4?
00:00:28 Well, what what we're it all started back in the summer of 86 talking about we're doing we're making it happen
00:00:36 We're making right for it's gonna be a real
00:00:39 We're gonna do it Radcon for real in March, right? Yeah, right come on you. Yeah. Yes
00:00:46 Yeah, I mean fuck it present time of recording a lot of the in like this very
00:00:52 Specifics are not ironed out, but we are planning to do it in March
00:00:57 hopefully in Virginia and
00:01:00 It's gonna be based around the idea of like spring break
00:01:06 Students still where where the PCP University students and we're on spring bake a break in like a beach
00:01:14 Spring bake may know what I'm saying, bro. We have the we have the house picked out or we have a house tentatively picked out
00:01:21 Yeah, and let's let's sell it. It's a it's like a beach
00:01:25 Yes, on the beautiful god. What if we don't I mean, I hope we get it. So yeah, we picked out. Yeah, it's great
00:01:32 It's on the fucking beach. It's a beautiful. I found it. I am responsible. I saw the listing and was like hey nice value
00:01:40 It's actually cheaper than the last place. Yeah, and on the fucking beach, which makes me go. Yeah
00:01:46 I'm surprised because more of us live in Boston
00:01:50 So I thought that we should do it here because we would save on travel costs, which is true
00:01:57 but yeah, yeah, but
00:01:59 Rental costs are lower in Virginia. So I kind of think it doesn't make much difference and it probably evens out and
00:02:08 Honestly, I want to go on a trip. I want to go on vacation. Yeah
00:02:12 Yeah, I'm gonna get on the plane and make us my summer getaway to sunny Virginia Beach
00:02:17 Tropical paradise
00:02:22 But yeah, but anyway, yeah, let's talk about talk about like little hints little hint
00:02:27 Oh, let's can we say the name the name we have in general? We have well
00:02:31 We're not 100% settled on it. Are we it's definitely rad corn for something rad corn for paradise or red corn for paradise
00:02:40 We were looking at the beach house and we thought that like a tropical getaway paradise
00:02:45 The theme would be pretty funny in it's a tropical paradise getaway
00:02:49 But also we have to be in school because we're bad children who didn't
00:02:53 Delinquents and we have to listen to a bunch of really great lectures
00:02:57 But also it's Virginia in March and the beach will be miserable and the water will be ice cold and we will probably suffer a lot
00:03:06 Here's the funniest part is that we're thinking of maybe doing a sexy swimsuit calendar
00:03:13 Like on the beach of all of us. Yep. These were these were all ideas
00:03:18 These are all ideas. We were tossing around that there might be a stretch goal for the Kickstarter
00:03:23 The calendar is a great idea
00:03:25 for only for only the highest and most dedicated donors
00:03:31 Because I don't want anyone to fucking see that shit
00:03:35 It's gonna be good. I'm gonna buy a wig. I'm gonna buy a wig and I'm just gonna be an anime girl. Oh
00:03:40 That's a good idea. I don't want to oversell it
00:03:42 But just picture all of us and your favorite anime swimsuit
00:03:46 I already have the fucking Ryuko Matoi like thing that I wore on that one time
00:03:51 True, but that's not a swimsuit. That's it. Well, you know, it's it's a school suit. It's it's it's it's got a skirt, you know
00:04:01 It sounds good as opposed to the Radcon 3 arena
00:04:04 We're all like our weaponry with our guns instead sexy pin-up girls. I guess I guess I better
00:04:12 I guess I better do stick to keto real hard so I can have my beach body ready. Oh, yeah, you better fuck
00:04:18 Yeah, you better you want to have like a like a
00:04:23 Comeback from fat Ben the last time
00:04:26 Yeah, I mean
00:04:29 Unironically for ever since Radcon 2 or 3 I have been thinking God, I can't look like that
00:04:35 For I can't do it
00:04:38 It's unacceptable on that. Yeah, true. There's been a transformation. I can I can I can always succeed more
00:04:45 True you can always be thin. I was yes. Look, you can always be better. Mmm. So until you're in the Skeleton War
00:04:53 You can always be
00:04:56 So
00:04:57 The lectures, right? Yeah, the lectures are to my thinking the thing that people I mean, they're the things that I mean for me
00:05:05 They're my most popular content. I think same. I think that's true across. Okay. I didn't know if it was true across the board
00:05:10 But yeah, I'm not surprised people love the lectures. So me personally. I'm double. I'm gonna do at least to I'll do at least
00:05:17 I'll do more if I can stomach it and if anyone anyone will stand for me to do so
00:05:23 I'll do them all
00:05:26 And I thought that like I thought it would be funny. I thought it would be funny if we
00:05:32 Actually had I've said this to you guys but for the audience
00:05:34 I thought it'd be funny if we actually had like a class itinerary
00:05:37 That we like like we get there and we've got it all figured out like oh on Monday
00:05:42 Professor fucking best man is doing a lecture on
00:05:46 Dogs in the media and and and at 6 p.m. Hippo's mates are running the
00:05:53 Students are doing the lectures hippos doing one on birds under the sea and I
00:06:00 Mean, I think we can hint or like just like show what the lectures are gonna be about right? Yeah, I mean, I don't mind
00:06:08 I'm sure everyone knows I've been saying it forever. I'm gonna do the Chris follow Chris Chan follow-up
00:06:14 I also want to do one on Jennifer Diane writes
00:06:18 And her comics because I think those are neat and I've just got I discovered sort of an arc
00:06:24 I discovered sort of like a weird like sort of a weird like history arc that ties in with the thing that she's best known for
00:06:32 Which is the coca-ro-wish comic
00:06:34 Right and how that it's all part of a broader story that I think is kind of neat
00:06:39 So yeah, those two and maybe others. I don't know. I know I talked in the past about maybe doing a
00:06:47 Df and Strix but like yeah, and I think that would be funny
00:06:51 But what sucks about that is that I would have to watch like fucking thousands of hours of like
00:06:58 D&D podcasts, and I just don't know if it's worth it
00:07:02 Yeah, that's a big oof. Yeah, it's not a good look in 2019
00:07:06 Wait fuck it's 2020
00:07:10 Even worse
00:07:14 This look is getting more and more yikes by the second
00:07:20 I'm doing it. I'll probably do exactly one lecture
00:07:23 And I'll just say it's relevant to the setting
00:07:27 I guess we'll say where we're at and I'm thinking of things as I can do
00:07:30 Ah, sand. You're gonna talk about how it's Russian course
00:07:32 Do we know what it is? Have you told us?
00:07:35 I'm sure I have. I'm sure and I think I might even said it publicly, but
00:07:40 Because I forget. You know with the ocean in the background with the sandy shore on this
00:07:44 Well, you know it might be relevant. We'll see. Kingdom Hearts
00:07:47 Yeah, that is Kingdom Hearts relevant. The first level of Kingdom Hearts
00:07:51 I guess I could always I was thinking of doing like a Kingdom Hearts like two
00:07:55 I guess I could do that, but there's not that there's only one game effectively worth of story
00:08:02 And like I don't know it could do like a mini lecture that's like 30 minutes long
00:08:06 It makes that I think it makes worth it. I think it's where I think it makes sense
00:08:10 I mean like you did this big you did this big Kingdom Hearts lecture. It got really popular
00:08:15 And now there's a new game. It's like the final game in the series is wrap wraps it up. There's new context
00:08:20 Why not do I mean you've already done follow-up videos to the lecture. Yeah, maybe it's true
00:08:24 Maybe it should just be a follow-up rather than lecture number two like it's like it's like a
00:08:31 Like a supplementary class. Yeah extra credit extra credit. Yeah, not extra credits like the actual my favorite YouTube channel
00:08:39 No, yeah, no, not them they made video that was cringe and I saw people say that it was cringe
00:08:46 It's it's true live it down. It's it's not it's not wrong. Well, I'll I'll keep you nice post
00:08:52 Well, we'll see but I mean the Kickstarter from the time of when this comes out
00:08:56 We're hoping the Kickstarter is like up and running like within a week of when you hear this. So
00:09:01 Maybe keep your fucking wallets open boys. That's
00:09:09 Times of the essence considering the time is kind of of the essence because we want to do it over over spring break
00:09:16 Which is I'll just give you the dates. I believe it's March 6 to 13th is
00:09:20 Munchy spring break. So it's framed around that with like the weekends or whatever. Oh shit
00:09:25 I just realized on February like the the PCP dating sim will be out. Oh Valentine's Day. That's true
00:09:34 We created PCP dating sim scenes in real life guys. We could all like I'm sure there'll be like a live stream
00:09:42 Set that we could we could just play the game. We could play that. Oh my god
00:09:46 As the PCP. Oh my god, that's a great idea. That's that's a real good
00:09:50 It's gonna be there's gonna be another role rumble if we can get that working again. Hopefully we can we it's a it's a necessity
00:09:56 It's a tradition. Yeah, so we he's gonna be video games and anime, you know your things you're like
00:10:02 Fuck yeah, fuck wait. What's it gonna say? Oh? Oh?
00:10:08 Let's discuss the fact that everything costs way more than we thought last time and we lost
00:10:14 Even though we hit all our stretch goals. We ended up losing money
00:10:18 that we did
00:10:20 That okay, primarily it was because of the because all of you motherfuckers live
00:10:25 Internationally and destroyed us with a thousand dollars in shipping costs that we did not see they're even worse than immigrants
00:10:32 They're just plain foreigners. They couldn't and that's just one of these goddamn foreigners just gonna emigrate to my goddamn country
00:10:40 It's already so easy how much easier can we make it for you to hop the border? Jesus Christ
00:10:45 We're giving you free shit and everything. Just come over here. Take my fucking job. Just save me the goddamn postage
00:10:54 Okay, so let us so so last time we asked for five thousand eight hundred dollars for rad con three
00:11:00 Oh sweet as we broke it down understood it this time, okay, because because some unnamed unmentionable
00:11:07 bureaucratic fools were in charge of rad con twos
00:11:12 Finances and whatnot not a godlike mathematical machine such as yours truly who documented every expense and whatnot
00:11:18 We have the facts and the she showed me the spreadsheet. It's a nightmare. I can't understand it
00:11:24 Yeah, it was developed that that spreadsheet was developed for the very specific purpose of just identifying who was owed what money
00:11:30 So it's not optimized for just I didn't like fucking counting up all the expenses
00:11:36 I should say not sir
00:11:39 Okay, okay, but that being said
00:11:42 Now that we actually know what like ten days in a place having rad con
00:11:47 We know what it costs and shall I base how shall I just say the number shall I just say what we're looking for
00:11:52 Fucking go for it. Yeah, all right with all the expenses
00:11:55 We all lost money with when accounting for flight food for all this stuff
00:12:00 So we have we've pretty much reverse engineered
00:12:02 How much we need to just break even to get like six or seven of us based on like how much things cost last time
00:12:09 That's right, including like food if we just want to not lose any money
00:12:13 Yeah, we would ask for
00:12:15 Considering like the 10% fee that Kickstarter asked for we're gonna ask for right about ten thousand dollars
00:12:21 That's how much it costs, you know to make the whole thing happen. You know, maybe we don't
00:12:25 Maybe we shouldn't include food costs. Maybe maybe that's not necessary
00:12:29 Like we have to eat
00:12:34 I think it was like a couple hundred for the whole we're talking about a couple hundred for the whole 10
00:12:37 It's like ten days of just get a giant bag of rice for like ten dollars. That's all we'll eat
00:12:43 That's not keto. No, it's not well. Well, listen, this is how I'm thinking about it
00:12:48 Oh, I'm thinking about it overall the way that we did it last time
00:12:51 We yeah, we just way undervalued everything and of course that this number is including like making stretch goals
00:12:57 Shipping them out, which is like a thousand dollars just by itself to do that shit
00:13:01 And you know, we've got to incorporate all those into it
00:13:03 Like we can do things like not worry about like the food costs and whatnot
00:13:08 But all that means is that we're just putting the cost of this time on like us as individuals and look that's fine
00:13:14 Well, if you want to like pay for things out of our own pocket, that's okay
00:13:18 I'm just saying I'm just saying that we would be buying food whether we were at Radcon or not
00:13:23 I mean, that is true that that is true
00:13:26 You're not wrong about that and so I mean maybe what I would have that's like a that's like a quibble
00:13:31 That's like a pretty I mean like even if we took food out we'd be charging like
00:13:35 9,500
00:13:37 It's not it's not like a deal breaker break huge difference and I mean when we analyze it
00:13:43 I mean a lot of us spent tons of time after Radcon 3 working on extensive
00:13:48 Complicated editing projects and the man hours involved in those alone. Oh, okay, let me let me let me talk
00:13:54 Let me talk about that so um
00:13:56 Yeah, ten ten paces and draw right was a massively complicated video to edit
00:14:02 I mean by my state it was it was by far the most complicated video. I've ever edited it took me like
00:14:07 Several months working on it on and off. It was a nightmare
00:14:10 And I didn't make any money off of it
00:14:14 Like like that was that was just like that was like probably like
00:14:19 60 or 70 hours of like totally unpaid labor and I will not do it again
00:14:25 Yes, and the same with t-bat resurrection was great. I'm glad it exists, but that arc is closed
00:14:31 I'm not doing that again at least not for free if someone paid me. That's a different story
00:14:35 You know I would really like there to be like a ten paces and draw a stretch goal so that I would yeah
00:14:42 Yeah, that's what like I would I'm not saying I would never edit it again, but I will not do it for free
00:14:47 I'm sorry. I don't I don't think that much work for for free is like reasonable
00:14:52 So I don't feel like I don't feel like it's unreasonable for me to say I would need a budget
00:14:57 Allotment to put that amount of work in
00:15:00 Yeah, I mean I would like to do something with ten paces to draw because now that like
00:15:04 We could probably plan it out better and like we could do it better
00:15:07 And and like you actually screen record so like we could have footage of the drawings coming together and stuff like that
00:15:13 Because like munch is gonna have an iPad. I have an iPad. I have another tablet computer
00:15:16 So like we'd have we'd have abilities to do things and we could I really like ten paces and draw
00:15:22 I feel like the audience response was
00:15:26 I don't know did people like positive but not explosive hot like they like some people liked it and some people didn't give a shit
00:15:33 So like, you know, it had its it had its fans
00:15:36 I mean lectures are the meat and potatoes of Radco, you know, if you're gonna probably be doing a lot of that's
00:15:43 That's where my focus is that but I mean, I still want to be I do want to be uploading like, you know, just stupid
00:15:50 Vlogs and just like of course bullshit. Yeah, I mean, I I think we've discovered the perfect formula
00:15:56 In terms of being in a place the perfect formula is
00:16:00 Getting a place just like Rad country a big beautiful house that we can do stuff
00:16:04 And there's plenty of rooms to create things and goof around and whatever do whatever the fuck we want as late as we want and
00:16:10 We're all there to work for like a dedicated period of time
00:16:14 there is as few distractions as possible and
00:16:17 And we just put ourselves in just a creative mode and we get to see our friends for you know, a good 10 days
00:16:22 It's really it's the best environment to do it how valuable having the house the arena
00:16:27 For last for icon. It was so good. It allowed so many things happen simultaneously
00:16:33 Yeah, yeah, we were talking about like we were talking about saving money by doing it at Digi's place
00:16:38 But like it's yeah, it's wouldn't be that it's not it's theoretically possible
00:16:43 But it would be I say terrible we would be crammed in there
00:16:47 There would be no free space like the thing about the house that we rented was like they had the like at night
00:16:52 Like the basement was empty you could go
00:16:53 Yeah, like like at any given time you could go and like anyone could go somewhere and do something themselves and not bother another person
00:17:00 I mean that was never happened to paint the picture because like you Nate you and
00:17:05 Give we're downstairs recording pottycast and then we were upstairs running streams pretty much constantly
00:17:11 And then while the stream was going on I think at some point we were recording something in the kitchen as well
00:17:16 So there was just there were like three things going on at once just because of that space was there
00:17:20 It was just and then like like ben was saying the basement being available like the whole mining at night thing happened with those two or three videos
00:17:27 Right, right would not have happened without it
00:17:30 So it was just it was just so much stuff that happened at radcon 3 just because the space allowed them to all
00:17:36 Gile at the same time god
00:17:38 Yes, I guess we should mention who is
00:17:41 Definitely coming to this if yes sure sure so it's all four of us
00:17:46 And digi and munchie
00:17:48 Anyone else and victor as camera and victor of course victor will be there
00:17:52 Uh getting the the perfect shots the succulent visuals victor victor and his camera are such assets to uh to radcon
00:18:00 I mean if not for the lectures as well as other stuff
00:18:04 If anything, I wish we had another camera man, but hey, what can you do one's uh one's pretty uh two camera man
00:18:09 Would make such a difference for like, um
00:18:12 For something like 10 paces 10 paces. Yeah. Yeah
00:18:16 You you were always uh, uh, what's the word uh being saying how unfortunate was you didn't have more b rolled
00:18:21 No, uh, honestly like yeah without b roll it almost
00:18:26 It really handicapped it
00:18:28 Yeah, yeah, um, you can't do those like those uh what do they call it the fucking like those uh fear factors
00:18:33 Shots of like where someone's lecturing like I hit a really tough time
00:18:36 And they do that like the close soon with a dun dun unlike a totally neutral face right a participant
00:18:41 You know create the narrative. Yeah, that's the good shit. I mean, I wonder if we could get
00:18:46 Someone to I mean does victor only have one camera?
00:18:49 Would he only be and could we get someone to like do b roll for just like one day?
00:18:53 Maybe let's just say we're doing 10 bases and draw just an example
00:18:56 Maybe one of I mean, I probably wouldn't be in it. I mean, I maybe could be a judging. I don't fucking know
00:19:01 But like I could I'm not I'm no cameraman
00:19:04 But maybe one of us like could do that role of trying to get b roll footage while it's going on
00:19:10 I don't know if he has a second camera, but if he did something to think about I suppose
00:19:14 Yeah, and because victor doesn't live far away. We've got access to his uh, oh, yeah
00:19:18 He must he must have more like like at his since his house will be there
00:19:23 Maybe I don't even trust any of us with the camera though. I mean those are expensive pieces of equipment
00:19:28 I mean since we'll be maybe
00:19:30 Like maybe like maybe like hope maybe hope could do it
00:19:33 Maybe hope could carry a second camera or may or someone. I don't know just get someone just for just for that one
00:19:38 Just for that one event
00:19:40 Yeah, victor's sick like billion-dollar camera and then all the b roll is just shot on an iphone handycam or webcam
00:19:47 On my iphone
00:19:49 Unregistered hypercam to converted compressed
00:19:52 We could like sell a tape like in the wrong aspect ratio. It's like vertical
00:19:57 Yeah, we could sell a tape like a gopro to the ceiling and it can act like security cam footage
00:20:02 Oh, that's true. Honestly. Honestly. Yes. I want that
00:20:07 Hey, do you guys all still have your go pros? I do. No wait, that's unironically a great idea
00:20:12 Okay, yes, please and I'll put and I'll make it like black and green and make it look like night camera footage, right?
00:20:20 And I'll make it look like
00:20:22 The
00:20:25 It'll be like
00:20:29 Yeah, just all over the house. They're just live streaming constantly
00:20:33 I definitely want to film like a lot of stupid vlogs
00:20:37 Wandering around on the beach, perhaps drunk, perhaps high and attacking the ocean
00:20:42 Oh, I want to spend time with I love the beach so much. I was saying it's gonna be cold. It's gonna be
00:20:47 I'm prepared. I'm prepared
00:20:50 Uh, I I was saying that I'm sure that at least one night of rad con. I will get
00:20:56 plastered
00:20:57 Uh, and you mind you must promise to turn the cameras off
00:21:02 We all film it, but wait, there's no promises. There's no promises that it will or will not go online
00:21:08 If it gets funny enough if it gets too embarrassing, you're I'll I will swear a blood oath against you
00:21:17 Uh, it'll be worth it. Okay, understandable. All right. Hey speaking of endorsements. This is unrelated, but I just got a message from
00:21:23 Uh, the devu who said very quality shovel night video and he said quote just doing based chad king things is his favorite line
00:21:32 Thanks devu
00:21:34 Appreciate that. All right unrelated
00:21:36 I call that an endorsement of rad con for if ever there was one. Oh, yeah, dude. Oh, yeah
00:21:41 There's gonna be probably content recorded there. Oh, yeah, probably all our fucking weirdo goofy retarded shows will be featured
00:21:50 They could be if I can chibi barkers. There's definitely gonna be you know, guys
00:21:54 I'm just putting it out there. I'm just telling you right now
00:21:57 $15,000 stretch goal. We get jeff through in the building guys
00:22:01 10 late out 10 late is in the building people. Please. It's happening. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Please. Can we
00:22:10 Where does he live?
00:22:12 Uh, Canada like Vancouver
00:22:15 Fuck yeah, all candidacies in the same city. Okay. Well, I'll get him a horse. I don't know
00:22:21 Also, I lied, but maybe we could ask him anyway. That'd be funny. That would be epic. Uh, how sick would that be?
00:22:28 I'll ask him. Pretty great
00:22:30 Dude, what if jeff through comes down to do a lecture like if he has an interesting topic that might actually be cool
00:22:36 If he wants to I'd say he's welcome. I mean, yeah
00:22:41 Absolutely, I suspect there may be some personnel differences between some of the members of the show
00:22:50 No, that'd be so great. We we bring in we bring in jeff through as the exchange student who comes in mid-arp to shake everything up
00:22:58 Damn
00:23:00 That's some good stuff. That's some good stuff. See it's like he it's season two and he's he's the poochie
00:23:05 He's the poochie character they introduce and then and then near the end we get monkey in to shoot the school
00:23:11 Yes
00:23:13 Yeah
00:23:15 That's uh, that's the meme. Oh, oh, this could be this is how jeff gets killed off in the arc. He takes the bullet for digi
00:23:22 They have a beautiful healing moment. And then uh, god, then he's written out of the story. This is the best fanfic ever
00:23:28 Damn, that's good stuff. That's good stuff. The pathos
00:23:33 Yeah, these are all great ideas guys. You're definitely gonna see all this. Yeah, this is all
00:23:38 Absolutely confirmed true no lies at all
00:23:42 That should be the tagline. No, we're definitely actually doing this
00:23:47 Hashtag no lies
00:23:49 project
00:23:52 Fucking a
00:23:54 Well, I'm so I'm super fucking excited though. I cannot wait and I it's it's a fucking travesty and and frankly
00:24:00 It's unbelievable to me that it's been two years
00:24:03 It doesn't it doesn't feel like it in a way
00:24:05 It doesn't feel like it at all and also it's like objectively just a huge mistake
00:24:10 It should not have it should not have been two years since the last just for the record folks
00:24:14 If everything goes ahead as planned, it would have been literally exactly two years
00:24:18 It will be on like march like 14th or whatever was when radcon three happened
00:24:23 It will be on march 14th. We'll be like one of the last days or whatever of this radcon for two years later
00:24:30 Yeah, that was that was a big oof. That was a big mistake. Uh, but uh, hopefully my god
00:24:35 It's pretty I was I was still in my 20s. I was still in my 20s when we had radcon three
00:24:40 Holy shit ending my 20s
00:24:43 With radcon three. I you know, I think a large part of it. I'll say this to defend us slightly was
00:24:50 I mean
00:24:50 t-bat resurrection took a full year to be finished because we had so many other things competing for time and stuff
00:24:58 And if I made my number, right, could I got it done first? I guess but I had fucking shit to do so, you know
00:25:04 Yeah, something like that again, like you can't do that unless it's so it's so much work
00:25:10 Well, let's make another stretch go ben $99,000. We make t-bat resurrection too. No, it's back, baby
00:25:17 t-bat t-bat resurrection
00:25:20 90 that's right. We're going all the way up. You got
00:25:24 Like fucking studio first first. There was t-bap resurrection now. There's t-bap
00:25:29 Ascension where you send back into pony heaven
00:25:32 That does sound good for season five, baby for for gen five. I mean phantom horn phantom horn has to conclude his arc in
00:25:39 New los angeles city
00:25:43 We'll have to see how that plays out
00:25:45 Surely t-bap saga including t-bap resurrection all took place before the the slime city saga
00:25:51 Uh, I suppose it must have. Yeah, the continuity is questionable
00:25:57 I mean, when was phantom sealed in stone with keg? Uh, presumably
00:26:03 Yeah, I guess I guess that all I guess that all must have happened. You know ben
00:26:07 Yeah, I guess I guess I guess slime and punishment must take place post resurrection
00:26:11 You could theoretically end it with I mean keg and phantom sealed in the garden for misdeeds
00:26:15 I mean keg was like, I didn't do anything but whoops. There he goes steel. I don't know
00:26:20 Maybe wouldn't that be amazing. It's it's it's conceivable. I don't know. I don't know. I'll have to think about it. I didn't even
00:26:28 Who knows like like the spider's web that I've woven of like the timelines of keg and phantom
00:26:33 It's all it's all a rich tapestry. Uh, that deserves a lecture as well
00:26:37 Honestly, maybe it fucking does
00:26:40 Well, we've said like the horseshoe saga in general like all of our boys together and like the mlp fandom really well
00:26:48 It's own lecture. I think I think it would be funny to do a horseshoe crew lecture
00:26:52 But like an in a canon one like what canonically did like the events of course of a cutie mark kerfuffle
00:26:59 Yeah, yeah, like what canonically did the lives of phantom horn keg standard tall tales give and take digi bro starboard bow starboard bow
00:27:07 Yeah, lethal a roar
00:27:10 This has to be jeff's lecture. We can't talk about
00:27:13 the biggest fan
00:27:16 That'll be his uh, his um, you know, he'll get given that as like a project and he'll be like, ah, damn it
00:27:23 I don't want to do this and then his seo manager will say jeff jeff baby. Sweetheart
00:27:28 We got the numbers in the kids are all talking about this horseshoe crew. You've got to make your next video about this horseshoe
00:27:34 You gotta add tags. You gotta add hashtag horseshoe crew to all your videos. You gotta tag it. You gotta optimize your seo, sweetheart
00:27:42 I have I have nothing but respect who is saying 10 late, uh
00:27:46 He's seo manager guy the one who tells him what to make videos on who apparently is a real person from what I understand
00:27:51 I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I remember
00:27:54 That's what it sounds like. I remember him. Yeah, baby. Baby. Sweetheart. You gotta make uh, sort out our line
00:28:00 You gotta jojo's bizarre
00:28:02 You heard about this enemy naruto. They got a video game now
00:28:07 It's everyone's favorite character with the seo c
00:28:10 Oh, that's yeah, that's good. Yes. Yeah, that's pretty good
00:28:15 Um
00:28:16 Man, fuck. I don't know. I'm really fucking hype for red count four. It's pretty cool because like literally 48 hours ago
00:28:22 We had no plans other than like
00:28:24 Very comfortable 48 hours ago. I was I was fucking I was uh, it's a wonderful life in it
00:28:29 I was on that bridge ready to end it all ready to have nothing to look forward to and now I'm I'm full of hope
00:28:34 I'm rejuvenated
00:28:36 It was funny. We were having a conversation and we were just like guys everything sucks. What's what do we do?
00:28:40 And they're like, what about
00:28:42 Things could not suck or remember radcons and we're like, oh, yeah
00:28:46 Um, why don't we do that? Why don't we just do that? Why don't why are we yeah?
00:28:51 Yeah, you know, it's it's funny for the record like that
00:28:55 We've been initiating that conversation for a while and the stopping point we kept hitting like recently
00:29:00 Munchie had said like hey, I'm free during spring break like we could theoretically do it then
00:29:04 And we had gotten to the point where he just hit the wall of like, okay, but where should we do it?
00:29:07 Do we need an air maybe could we do it in digi's house? But then we were just like fuck it
00:29:12 Uh, no, it's too small. We answered those questions and that's all it took and once that's done
00:29:17 uh, stone's rolling downhill and uh, that's uh, yeah, the rest is the rest is the easy part
00:29:22 So keep an eye out for that fucking Kickstarter. I guess come in come in within a week of when you see this very likely
00:29:28 Wow, maybe a little bit longer, but that's very soon. Yeah, soon, but soon though. There will shortly be a video announcement
00:29:37 No doubt about it. No doubt about it. Oh my god. Oh my god
00:29:41 So click that bell if you haven't already to get that sweet notification as soon as it tries
00:29:46 hell, yeah
00:29:48 Uh, it's great. Very very happy. You know, everyone's all the comments complain the show stagnant the show sucks
00:29:54 Guess what the show always sucked. It's not about the show. It's about rad con and we're back, baby
00:30:00 Yeah, the rad con is definitely like the the resurgence button like
00:30:06 Yeah, we would you know meeting up and doing all that cool shit
00:30:10 We'll definitely make us more hype about each other and the podcast
00:30:14 That's definitely true
00:30:15 And the fact that we have gone two years is the it's probably the reason the show suffered bad such a disaster
00:30:22 Two years without the orgy that keeps them rejuvenated. I guess we did have that meetup last year
00:30:28 Yeah, it was it was brief though. Yeah
00:30:31 It was rad con 3.3 things that I mean to plan to like can that was such a fucking dumb
00:30:37 That was such a dumb ass meeting
00:30:40 Was totally pointless. I mean it was kind of unnecessary, but I mean I didn't object to coming out to visit the peeps anyway
00:30:47 So it was fun. I was happy to do it. Uh
00:30:49 I mean, you know, I'm out in Cincinnati. I'm not near anybody. I know except really michelle. So, you know, sure
00:30:54 I was happy. I mean that part of it is fine. Yeah, but like the business meeting aspect of it
00:30:59 I think I remember
00:31:01 You guys were talking about that and I was like
00:31:04 This is dumb. This has nothing to do with me and it's probably all bullshit anyway
00:31:08 So I'm just gonna go get drunk in the basement and then I did that did that didn't happen. I didn't happen
00:31:13 I mean at that point that that was kind of when we were answering some of the questions about what this these plans
00:31:19 For the future looked like and I don't know. We have some ideas now, but we're still working it out. I don't know
00:31:25 We'll see anyway rad con
00:31:27 Coming soon
00:31:29 Keep talking and I was gonna say speaking of on this subject. Oh, hey a comment
00:31:34 I mean, is it uh, I guess comment if you want to let us know what kind of things you'd want to see or like what kind of stuff would
00:31:43 Entice you to donate. I guess what would what would be a good what would be a stretch
00:31:47 What would be a stretch goal that you'd be hyped to like push for I don't know
00:31:50 Yeah, if you have any ideas, but we are thinking of doing
00:31:54 We have we have we have a couple ideas of our own
00:31:57 Let's be crystal clear though on the calendar and that we you I want I want to do the calendar
00:32:03 The calendar is a great idea. You audience you don't know what you want and you don't know what it's worth to you
00:32:08 That's our job to figure out
00:32:10 To strategize the ways to get you to donate your money because I mean, here's one of the things
00:32:14 But also charge too little for each of our goals last time
00:32:19 And we will not be so like it's going to be similar to last time
00:32:22 But like a bunch of things relatively are going to be more expensive
00:32:26 Because we we charge too little for them last time
00:32:29 It's like equivalent goals are probably going to be more expensive because we fucked up last time and all lost money
00:32:35 And I'd like to at least break even at least
00:32:38 It's sad. It's sad. That was a painful phone call for like two hours who went line by line through everything. It was like, oh, no
00:32:45 Oh, no, remember that. Oh, no, I remember because I expected that like there was going to be some leftover money
00:32:52 And we would all get maybe like negative money and we would all maybe just get the extra like hundred bucks or whatever
00:32:57 And then it was like no, it's actually just coming out of like when jessy
00:33:01 Like oh, yeah, jessy, we'll cover your flight. It'll be fine. And then like, you know slam
00:33:06 Big miss big three months later. Oh, we we got nothing. But we still promise the man
00:33:11 include or will probably include like a plan of like exactly pretty much like because it's going to be very similar to
00:33:17 The last ride con breakdown like you can compare it'll be probably maybe you'll find it interesting to compare because I certainly do
00:33:23 Like what we expected the expenses to be last time we made that like chart of the expenses versus now
00:33:29 We actually know exactly how much those were and we're going to use that as our template for what we expect to pay for everything
00:33:35 This time and it's a lot more than we thought last time. So uh red con three was so much fun
00:33:41 It sure was buddy. It was the best thing I did that entire year easily
00:33:46 Uh wait, yep. What did what did I do in 20? Oh, oh
00:33:51 Yeah, that was the best thing
00:33:53 I
00:33:55 Mean it was the only thing I did so I mean it just wins by the fault doesn't mean anything. I hate all of you guys
00:34:00 But still
00:34:01 Understandable. Yep. Yeah
00:34:03 2018 was a bit of a low key year for me while I was working on we ag was and uh
00:34:07 Like looking to quit my job relatively soon. So what better way to start a new decade than with another rad con
00:34:14 You're welcome. You're welcome. All indeed. I'm gonna make your so big spenders. Russell. I'm talking to you
00:34:21 Open up that wallet buddy. Break it wide open. Russell get ready. Toya get drunk when the Kickstarter goes live
00:34:28 Oh, it was like the ultimate handboy warrior was the like. Yes
00:34:32 Hashtag like wrestle wrestle
00:34:34 Let Russell wrestle guys. We had we had one we had one
00:34:38 handboy warrior
00:34:39 I kind of think we were we were shocked someone was willing to do that and we had a we had a
00:34:43 What do we have like 15 or 16 like the dad dads?
00:34:47 Yeah, I'm thinking, you know, based on that based on those numbers. I'm thinking maybe
00:34:51 We have a couple we can have some one or two tears in between those
00:34:56 Maybe there might be someone who doesn't want to go the full thousand, you know, that that was a joke
00:35:01 I mean, we did not expect anybody. Yeah. Well, now we know now. We know that some idiots
00:35:07 Out their fat whales just weighing us spew their blubber into our waiting mouths. Oh, yeah, so succulent
00:35:13 Uh, yeah, yeah
00:35:15 So what we should do is I think as I'm coming up with a handboy warrior tier for rad gun for $10,000
00:35:22 I I think I don't know. Maybe we keep it something similar
00:35:25 But we actually open that up. So there's a couple more entries in there or something because like a thousand is plenty
00:35:29 Yeah, I mean, yeah, maybe people will be interested in that
00:35:33 But like things for like the the dad
00:35:35 Well, like all of our tiers of like getting physical rewards all of those I think are going to be more expensive
00:35:40 And then the dad one should bump up the theme of um the thing about um
00:35:45 We're just trying to not lose money guys. That's all it is. We just want to not
00:35:49 The handboy warrior tier is exciting because it like put you you you are
00:35:53 Involved in the yeah, that's real value. That's really like we sure surely we can find other things that we could like
00:36:00 Do
00:36:01 I don't know
00:36:02 I'll bet we could think of some shit that like if you donate this tier
00:36:05 We will include you in something else. I don't know. We'll we'll put you in the calendar
00:36:10 I don't know. I mean the dad thing I guess was the one because we like talked about them in like the in the fucking
00:36:16 Whatever that was the arena. I I feel like we could have done more with that. I feel like if we do it again
00:36:20 We should definitely have more dad involvement somehow whatever that we'll come up with some better plans
00:36:26 Yeah, but but yeah, you're you're right. You're right
00:36:28 It'd be like members of the school board or whatever this time
00:36:31 Oh, they could be our dads. Oh, you know doing our coming for parent teacher night. You know, here's my dad
00:36:37 Figerson and what yeah, what if they are like, yeah, what if the donors they're they're the parent. They're the pta
00:36:44 What if they can like what if we give them like
00:36:46 I don't know. Maybe they can like make
00:36:48 Rules for us or something or maybe they can like give us commands
00:36:52 I don't know
00:36:54 Step dad. I have to do anything you say. I don't know. I'm in trouble now
00:36:59 I'm stuck in the washing machine bent over in this precarious position again. I hope you don't do anything weird step dad
00:37:05 Turns on the wash
00:37:15 That's not the scenario I'm just trying to
00:37:20 Well, I'm sufficiently less interested. You've you've been a you've been a real dirty girl. He says turning on the wash
00:37:25 Oh
00:37:33 Damn that extra spin turns it up to like heavily spoiled and just like
00:37:38 Yeah
00:37:41 Extra hot water. Yeah, just uh, you know, uh, you know how it is. You know how it is. That's the real shit
00:37:47 Okay, but no, okay. I think more like audience involvement is always a good idea
00:37:53 Mm-hmm. You know how in like the hunger games like donors can like pay to like give them shit or like
00:37:59 Yes, set up. Maybe set off bombs or something. You know, they could they interact with
00:38:02 We should set off some seaford down in the house that we don't put some mines in the beach, you know
00:38:07 Maybe like an epic prank. Maybe maybe the pta can be like maybe we'll I don't know
00:38:13 Maybe we could have like certain things we want to do but we could have like polls
00:38:17 But like only the pta members get to like vote to say like what we do
00:38:22 That can be done something this is a very this is a very half-formed idea, but I hope you get the kind of thing
00:38:27 I'm gesturing it. Yeah. I mean by the time this episode comes out a lot of these things may have been ironed out and
00:38:34 Understood as to what we're gonna do. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the the big things that are guaranteed are lectures and streams and
00:38:43 High school theming indeed indeed also the beach
00:38:48 Also, the beach will be there and the tropical house. We're gonna do like a slow-mo slow-mo fucking
00:38:54 uh
00:38:55 Splashing in the water going. He he
00:38:58 That sort of thing. We will drink everything out of coconuts
00:39:03 Every single time, you know just for for the record uh of interest
00:39:07 Maybe we'll get the mind racing or tingling or whatnot the the shovel knight Kickstarter, which I was looking into the other day
00:39:14 It had a thing where like if you pledge a certain excuse me
00:39:16 You pledge a certain tier you get to vote on which of the eight like mega man boss knights effectively
00:39:22 Like we'll get a playable mode of their own or whatever and like the three that one were voted on like by those people
00:39:28 So maybe like influence in some style or some decision of something
00:39:32 Oh, wait, here's just an idea. Maybe there's like there's we there's some idea for a video
00:39:36 And like the star of the video will be voted upon by the serene
00:39:41 It'll be one of us will be like the subject of whatever this thing is and is decided by the viewers
00:39:47 And uh, I don't know. Maybe something like that could be um, the um penny the penny arcade
00:39:53 Like d&d twitch the the the c team
00:39:57 Uh, in particular has the thing where um the the twitch subscriber base the subscribers
00:40:03 They're called the shadow council and they get to like vote on stuff and like uh
00:40:07 The dm will like he'll ask like, you know, what what is the dark secret behind like rosy beastingers?
00:40:13 Like long lost uncle or whatever and it's like, oh, he's he's secretly gay or oh, he's secretly straight
00:40:20 And it's like I like this idea of
00:40:23 We we we modified like the dad tier into this pta one and now they get to like be they get to they get to exert
00:40:29 They get to exert a certain amount of uh, of uh, uh, authorial control
00:40:34 Interesting idea. It's an interesting idea. Yeah
00:40:37 Thank you. You're welcome
00:40:39 You're welcome future pta members
00:40:43 Uh, all right. Well, I guess that's pretty much it for all our rad con thoughts thus far
00:40:48 We're currently busily racing to get all the assets prepared so it can be out as soon as possible
00:40:53 Later today, I'll be working more on these on these details of tiers and stuff
00:40:56 So, uh, I have to uh, I have to do the the write-up still
00:41:00 Indeed indeed much. He's working on a logo and other things that you'll see soon. How exciting
00:41:06 I am
00:41:07 I don't know man. It's a real fucking hype. It's real fucking hype for it. My dude
00:41:15 I am as well, but I guess we must move on. Um
00:41:20 New matthew mitosis video out today or two days ago before before we start talking about stuff
00:41:26 I have an an announcement
00:41:28 um
00:41:30 Hopefully either today or the weekend coming
00:41:35 The first chapter of my new comic will be out. No
00:41:39 Shit, I haven't exactly decided on the title, but it's the lord of ghosts comic
00:41:46 Hey
00:41:48 Fucking way, dude
00:41:50 Yeah, okay
00:41:50 Is this post his his involvement in uh becoming the the entity or whatever it was and then getting spat out of
00:41:57 Well, this is this is the story of of uh, the lord of ghosts and what he what happened to him after he was
00:42:05 Uh, uh, he was defeated and the mega slime was destroyed
00:42:09 Right. Um way back and this is his exploits
00:42:13 Uh leaving and outside of the city and the stuff that happens and it's
00:42:18 It's it's cool and I'm I'm proud of what I've written and drawn so far
00:42:22 I think like 14 out of the first 20 pages the the chapter is going to be in like
00:42:28 Each chapter is going to be like 20 pages long. There's going to be like four or five chapters
00:42:32 And uh, I hope fantastic. I hope for it to be basically done
00:42:37 By the middle of february
00:42:39 Oh, shit. So
00:42:41 Is it going to be on um
00:42:43 Aps adventures, it's going to be on a ps adventures. I might change that website's name to give and take dot com or something
00:42:50 Yeah, just for better branding
00:42:53 um
00:42:54 Uh, it'll be up on my webcomic website. It'll I'll probably make like an account on all of the
00:42:59 Webcomic places and put them there as well for no reason just just in case just in case somebody discovers me through that
00:43:07 And uh, that's um, uh, that's my big announcement
00:43:12 Say hopefully there will be a link in the description. It's fucking sick dude. That's fucking sick
00:43:16 Uh, are you gonna go back to uh red noir after this? Yes after that it's red noir until that's finished and then
00:43:23 Oh, yeah, the thing I was thinking because this first comic is like entirely digital
00:43:29 I I sketched it digitally and I'm gonna ink it and shade it digitally
00:43:33 And that's all cool. Uh red noir
00:43:36 I'm thinking of like drawing on my iPad to see how much easier or better that is or maybe not as good
00:43:43 You know just to see the the advantages that brings to that comic and then after that I'm gonna try and do a traditionally drawn
00:43:50 Um, perhaps digitally inked but definitely traditionally drawn comic for the third one
00:43:56 It's gonna be for the rest of the year. Maybe I don't know it's gonna be a long one
00:44:00 But that is my there's my comic thing
00:44:04 2020 was gonna be my my make three comics year
00:44:08 Um, I wasn't on the last episode so I didn't get to say like my goals
00:44:12 But I think I said it somewhere else
00:44:14 And that is that is what I'm gonna do
00:44:16 And it's a good goal. It's a good goal for anyone
00:44:19 Yeah, three comics three finished comics with stuff and it's
00:44:24 Fuck yeah, dude
00:44:26 That's good. That's getting me hype. You're getting me hype now
00:44:29 Dude, yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty stoked. I'm stoked more work for me. That's always a good a good thing
00:44:35 Mm-hmm
00:44:36 This is making me a little self-conscious that I haven't been working on slime and punishment. Oh god. Good. It's not only me
00:44:41 I was trying to like yeah
00:44:43 Watch that fear
00:44:45 I had a real big like
00:44:47 Idea of like January. All right. How many days are in January? Okay. How many pages could I potentially do?
00:44:54 Out of the pages I ever have sketched like finish them
00:44:57 Uh
00:44:58 Per day if it's like if I can keep on a pace of at least three per day
00:45:03 Um, I can finish the entire thing in January
00:45:06 Unlikely to happen because of you know, all sorts of things
00:45:10 motivation things getting in the in the way like
00:45:14 Other things taking up my time. So it's most likely going to be the middle of February
00:45:18 Um, but I'm I've been keeping good pace so far on the first day of January
00:45:23 I did like eight pages, but they were like easier to draw than the others
00:45:28 and um
00:45:29 I'm I'm feeling pretty good. I'm feeling pretty hype feeling pretty artistic
00:45:34 And I can't wait once we've finished this pcp to get back to it
00:45:39 Fuck
00:45:41 Yes, okay. Okay. Yeah, I
00:45:45 You know what? I was gonna say some shit about me
00:45:49 But it doesn't matter and I don't want to talk about it
00:45:52 Okay
00:45:53 Also, I I did your vaporette. Um, I would and I'm I'm really looking forward to all the vaporites being done
00:45:59 And having that fucking book on my shelf. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was I was gonna say
00:46:04 I should it's make it. I was gonna say it's making me want to work on that and get that done
00:46:08 I've been the last like yesterday night. I was like
00:46:12 I was like I was right. I was like, oh, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna I'm gonna finish it
00:46:17 Ah, but it's really late and I'm tired. I should do it. I would just sit there
00:46:20 We're just sitting there jacking my little dick. I'm just jacking my little dick here
00:46:24 And I was not gonna have time in the morning. I'll have time in the morning
00:46:27 I'll have time in the morning to do it. You know, I'll be I'll be more refreshed in the morning
00:46:32 You gotta like, um, I gotta leave space for jacking my little dick here tonight. That's what I got to be spending my time on
00:46:37 A little dick. He's a big wank
00:46:40 Nate, do you have any ground to stand on giving people shit for putting work off, Mr. Ghosting Show?
00:46:45 For having a little dick?
00:46:46 Yeah, I'm afraid not, damn you motherfucker
00:46:50 God damn you you fucking red bastard
00:46:56 You little red
00:47:02 But Ben, the way to think about it, um, to make it easier to understand the passage of time
00:47:10 Because it's easy to just think, oh, I'll do it tomorrow, but then tomorrow turns into three days
00:47:16 Um, you've just got to think of the calendar think of the date and like say I'm gonna do it on this date
00:47:22 Rather than this day of the week because there's there's gonna be another one of those days the next week
00:47:28 So if you say I want to do like a sentence of this thing or whatever on the 13th
00:47:35 Then if you don't have any plans on the 13th, then you remember it's the 13th
00:47:39 You'll be like, well, like best, you know, this is the day I set out to do this one thing
00:47:43 I may as well try and then you'll be more likely to do it
00:47:47 Yeah, I um, I
00:47:50 That's that makes sense. I talked about this. I talked about my uh, my the whole
00:47:55 Thing with me and the and the vaporettes in my oh, yeah, I did want to mention this in the show. I talked about it in my
00:48:02 Uh, patreon's only patreon podcasting that I stole from hippo, which I'm doing now. I'm doing a monthly thing
00:48:10 Um, you know, I was really relieved. I put that out and I thought well, this is fine
00:48:14 I hope people like that because you know, I don't
00:48:18 I just like everything I make I just put out for free
00:48:20 So there's not a lot of like shit that only my patrons get
00:48:23 So I was like, this is nice. This will be nice for them
00:48:26 But I was afraid because I said like I want to do like a Q&A
00:48:29 It would be cool if I had like sort of a back and forth with patrons where it's like they're asking me stuff
00:48:33 And I'm answering them because it's stuff they want to know
00:48:36 But I was a little afraid
00:48:38 Because like people don't use patreon like a social media site
00:48:41 So like posts don't get a lot of like likes or anything posts don't get a lot of engagement generally and like that's fine
00:48:48 But I was a little afraid that like I'll say hey, I want to make this like a Q&A
00:48:52 And it would just be radio silence and I'd get no questions
00:48:55 And then the next month I'd be like, okay. Well, I guess
00:48:58 Scrap that idea. I'll just pretend I never said it. I'll just ramble for 45 minutes. But no
00:49:04 I actually got like
00:49:05 Five or six like really good thoughtful questions from patrons
00:49:10 It was very nice and I was very happy and it's gonna be
00:49:13 And it's gonna it's gonna be it's gonna be a whole fucking
00:49:16 It'll probably be like an hour long
00:49:17 It'll probably take me like at least an hour to answer all that shit to go into all the depth and nuance
00:49:22 Um, I just ask the questions from patrons. That went over pretty well my discord, which works pretty well
00:49:27 I use yeah for the podcast that I do. Oh like when you get home from the gym and it's time for a little Q&A
00:49:32 Yeah, yeah, so, you know, you just go you go into discord and you just no like seriously though
00:49:36 Like and I just have in my discord server
00:49:38 I'll just ask because I do weekly podcasts and I'll just like you have questions
00:49:42 Drop in the suggestions channel. I'm the patron discord and because people are always there
00:49:47 Yeah
00:49:49 um
00:49:50 My it's a weird thing because like my money spenders podcast some people just don't listen to it
00:49:56 Even though they're patrons and you know, they want to be up to date
00:49:59 But it's like, ah shit. I haven't got around to that and I've realized some people just don't get around to it
00:50:04 I wonder whether that's because
00:50:07 It's like not as interesting
00:50:10 as
00:50:11 Maybe used to be or something. I just I I just forget like I did listen to your last one where you talked about like the rfck
00:50:18 And and stuff, but only because you reminded me because you like you said you mentioned it more
00:50:24 But yeah, I only listened to it because you reminded me because you said something about it in the in this
00:50:29 Discord server that we're in right now
00:50:32 I mean
00:50:33 What I've been doing is because because I have the the patron discord. I just do everything through there
00:50:37 I just I just use patreon to post them
00:50:39 because like
00:50:40 I was posting them on youtube, but it was easy to get around it and like keep like
00:50:44 Listening to new episodes without paying some people were doing that which is funny, but uh, I'll just go. I'll just whenever I
00:50:51 Add something on patreon. I'll just go onto the discord server and add everybody like there's a new thing
00:50:55 So like everybody knows that it's up as opposed to hoping they go on the patreon, which nobody does because why would you?
00:51:01 and uh, hope they notice it
00:51:05 Yeah, I can't put that in enough quotation marks. I mean I always get reminded by those things
00:51:11 Um by email, so I assume other people do maybe people just don't check email as much as I do
00:51:16 Possibly that's probably true. I
00:51:19 Don't check my email very much
00:51:21 um
00:51:23 Uh, my okay, so my like patreon is integrated with my discord right because like my pay my my discord is public
00:51:30 But there are patrons only rooms in it
00:51:33 Um, and I'm pretty sure like when you when you become a patron and you integrate your discord
00:51:39 It just gives you like the bot the patreon bot in my discord gives you the role that lets you into the patrons only rooms
00:51:46 But I'm pretty sure that if you unpatron
00:51:49 It doesn't take the role away. It does. So I'm pretty sure there are like people in there who became a patron
00:51:55 I'm pretty sure there's people in there who are not active patrons, but who the bot just failed to
00:52:00 What happens is what you do to like remove the role?
00:52:02 So what I'm saying is become a patron now because you can get so much value
00:52:06 You only have to pay them for one month to get permanent access to all my secret subscribers only discord channels
00:52:11 Well from what I understand it doesn't remove you from the server. It just removes your role as a patron
00:52:18 Yeah, yeah, but what I'm saying is that I still see people in that in that channel
00:52:22 Which means they must have that role who I do not think are active patrons. You would think so you would think so
00:52:27 So I don't know but I feel like if it's like a server that is entirely patron only
00:52:33 People can you know, they they're usually left in
00:52:37 Yeah, you have to manually get rid of people because the the pcp patron discord has
00:52:42 Occasionally people who have unpledged that the name changes color, but they're still in there
00:52:47 Yep, mm-hmm
00:52:48 But for hybrid discords which have like patron and non-patron
00:52:53 Uh rooms, I think it it generally seems to be
00:52:58 They only get access to the ones they should right because like you you lose the role
00:53:03 You can't get into those channels. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's fine. Maybe I'm just stupid. Maybe I'm just stupid
00:53:08 I've never had that problem, but you should you should look into it
00:53:11 Give it a test one of those people who you're suspicious of and see if it's kicking you out everyone
00:53:15 Yeah, it's suspicious of all of them paranoia setting in as as you should be
00:53:21 I don't I don't like them. I don't I don't I don't trust them
00:53:25 We were talking before about being excited to to make things and whatnot
00:53:29 And I know I said this on the on the private or the bonus episode recently about our plans for the future and whatnot
00:53:35 But I I've had a bunch of conversations recently
00:53:38 Including our one about radcon 4 that have really jazzed me up, uh for this uh this year coming
00:53:44 You know my my time on youtube here has been a little bit less successful and I was hoping uh, you know overall
00:53:49 That's why you know, uh
00:53:51 We aguas or I don't know maybe feeling a little stale and whatnot
00:53:54 So I mean I said in the bonus episode, but I'll just say it again here
00:53:56 Because I'm going to say it in my next we agua as well that I'm retiring the we agua format
00:54:00 There's also a long post about this on my patreon, which you can go look at for free
00:54:05 It's just you know, it's just my long explanation for why I'm doing it
00:54:08 Um, so I'm just going to be at the very at the at the at least for now temporarily suspending we aguas in
00:54:14 in you know
00:54:15 Indefinitely until such time as I decided to change it
00:54:18 Just to make time for the bigger projects people have been waiting for and and all that stuff
00:54:23 I think 2020 the year of ghosts is the right thing to do maybe
00:54:27 I well at the very least it we agua format has not been giving me the
00:54:32 I'm not I mean, I'm not saying that there's no room for like the we agua style content, but
00:54:38 Yeah, it shouldn't be at the expense of your bigger pieces people can read my post
00:54:42 They are expensive because I haven't talked about this much on their request, but uh, we we we've had another conversation and they don't mind anymore
00:54:49 I guess I whatever I've had an editor working with me on we aguas for a long time
00:54:53 Who just requested to not be known or whatever, but that does change now. It doesn't matter anymore
00:54:58 So like yeah, I've been working with an editor to give me more time
00:55:00 But even with that the amount of time that I've had to spend is just eaten into stuff
00:55:04 So I'm just like I've been talking with this editor and we're gonna we're gonna be switching it up
00:55:08 And we're gonna try to like
00:55:10 I'm gonna be working on big projects as like my main focus and like when there's small videos
00:55:14 Smaller ones kind of like my recent like konosuba or even the sunflower one
00:55:18 Maybe gonna try giving them those kind of smaller projects
00:55:21 Just uh, it's I'm trying to enter the era of quality of exciting bge videos again
00:55:26 You know, uh where people are give a shit and are interested to watch
00:55:30 So uh moving towards that. I'm pretty excited about it. I want to start making like youtube
00:55:37 Content. I want to start I want to start doing like video essays
00:55:41 Like like nothing fancy
00:55:43 I just want I just want to like
00:55:45 I don't know
00:55:46 I feel like maybe like rather than just getting mad on twitter
00:55:49 I feel like maybe a more constructive use of my energy
00:55:53 And like and when it comes to like the stuff I think about would just be to like write out an essay
00:55:58 Record myself reading it
00:56:00 Add some video clips of stuff or whatever just make drone images of you with your arms crossed talking
00:56:07 Yeah
00:56:09 Or whatever, I don't know
00:56:11 It would definitely be a better use of your time than twitter. Yeah, I agree though
00:56:16 I think you'll just get your information across in a much more
00:56:19 Constructive way
00:56:20 Prott, yeah, I might people might people I might make people like me instead of make people hate me instead of well
00:56:25 Let's not get too carried away here without expectations. I lost like 50
00:56:30 I lost like 50 twitter followers in like one day the other day, which I know that's not like a huge amount
00:56:36 But like that's more than I've ever lost in a day before and the weird part is
00:56:40 I I didn't even make any like particularly inflammatory tweets. That was just the day that like I tweeted my um
00:56:46 I tweeted my my discord link
00:56:49 And then I made a sort of tweet about like the left right spectrum
00:56:52 But I wasn't like it wasn't even like mean shit or any I don't know
00:56:55 I don't know what happened on that day
00:56:57 It was just like I guess people were sick of me or maybe twitter did a purge or something
00:57:01 Hey, yeah, that's always possible. I suppose. Yeah
00:57:04 Uh, yeah, well, I mean hell
00:57:06 I mean I agree just like when the ship doesn't seem to be going in the direction you want
00:57:09 Something should change probably gotta gotta change your tack to some degree. So, uh, yeah, give it a shot
00:57:15 I say I'll be interested to see what you make. I want I want to I want to do that
00:57:18 It's like, you know, I did like the ramble videos before and people generally like those
00:57:22 I feel and that's fine
00:57:24 I you know, I used to I used to be you know back in school and whatever
00:57:28 I was pretty good at writing essays, but I haven't done it in like forever
00:57:31 Yeah, I mean it's a skill. It's a muscle to flex and train and stuff like anything else
00:57:35 So I feel like it's something that I'm capable of doing a good a good job at and yeah
00:57:40 It's more constructive than just fucking airing my hot takes on twitter. You know, it's funny
00:57:45 I should say that I mean like effectively we Aga was have all been like unscripted videos
00:57:50 And making like both my sunflower and the and the kona suba videos
00:57:53 Those were intentionally scripted and designed to like be funny and entertaining and to convey the information
00:57:59 as efficiently as possible so as to not waste the viewer's time and
00:58:04 I both feel way better about those once they're done
00:58:08 And feel that people are not just like exhausted
00:58:11 Like long ass videos scripted ones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so like and and like I just feel good flexing that muscle again
00:58:18 So that's that's kind of one of those were like my testing grounds
00:58:21 But I really do
00:58:22 Like that feel and want to lean more into that. Um, I think I might
00:58:26 I think maybe when I'm done with like some of the stuff I got on my play right now
00:58:29 I might just I might just take some time and just like write a bunch of essays and like make them into videos and just like
00:58:35 See how they do
00:58:37 Doesn't seems like good idea. That's that sounds kind of exciting for me to be honest. I'm youtube is my platform
00:58:44 shareable clickable
00:58:45 Is it set or etc? I mean I've got you know, I've got like I'm not a big channel, but I've got like 14 000 subscribers
00:58:52 Which is like a it's a it's a respectable amount
00:58:55 I would get like a you know, I would get a couple thousand. You are well known for that christian lecture people know you for that
00:59:01 Sure. I sure am. Um, you know, I would get some amount of views on anything I did
00:59:06 I don't know. Yeah, it'd be cool
00:59:09 It'd be nice. It'd be nice if like any of them if I fucking had a video like
00:59:14 Do do well and like get seen
00:59:17 Whatever it is a nice feeling, you know, I don't feel I've had that in a while myself
00:59:21 I don't get that on twitter because like I've man. I'm get so jealous whenever I see someone with like a viral tweet
00:59:27 I've never had a tweet go viral. I've had some tweets get like maybe like 200 likes or something
00:59:32 Which is like a lot, but it's not viral. I'm just like, you know, I can't I just say something that's so fucking funny or goofy
00:59:38 Or incisive that just everybody wants to just jump on a why am I not a fucking
00:59:41 I've had a couple viral tweets, but they're never of things that I actually care about or like things that I
00:59:46 Like would want to go viral. I think my most popular tweet
00:59:50 Was there's two that were really popular
00:59:52 There was one when the first sonic trailer came out and I took a picture of the honeycomb mascot and just put it in photoshop
01:00:00 Made it blue. Yeah, that got like a couple thousand retweets and shit
01:00:04 And then another one was the uh, the aw shit here we go again
01:00:08 Meme that was going around twitter
01:00:09 I made one of those for the pirate bay when like disney plus was announced and like when all your favorite companies have a streaming service
01:00:15 And it was just him walking towards the pirate bay and that got like a billion fucking retweets. I'm like, these are both shit
01:00:21 I hate it. I hate all the people just like these simple memes, you know
01:00:25 It's like working on this fucking video game making all this 3d animation. Nobody cares drawing the meme. It's all you need
01:00:31 Draw draw a simple like visual
01:00:34 Comparison between things that are on people's mind and the in the current zeitgeist and like bam viral tweet
01:00:41 My viral tweet. I can't remember how much you got but it probably wasn't thousands and thousands
01:00:46 But the the serial experiments lane
01:00:49 Oh, right
01:00:51 That one was great. It was a an experiment using cheerios
01:00:55 Oh, yeah
01:00:56 Yeah, I remember that I think for me. I think this is my it wasn't we did not get like thousands of retweets
01:01:02 I think got like a couple thousand likes and I don't know maybe like a couple hundred retweets or whatever
01:01:06 But it was never cracked like like 200 likes is like the most I've ever got pathetic. Absolutely pitiful
01:01:12 This one was uh, it was when pokemon, uh
01:01:16 Let's go evie and pikachu was announced and they announced the quote friendly rival of like of the game
01:01:22 I made a post like posted him and I made this like long screeching rant in one tweet that was like like
01:01:28 What happened to rivals like I want the rival to break my fucking spine and step on my neck and rip my fucking heart out
01:01:34 And feed it to me. That's the pokemon rival supposed to be and then the last line was also he looks gay
01:01:40 That was like that was like the full tweet. Uh, so I guess people resonated with that to some degree god
01:01:46 I hate how difficult it is to find specific tweets on twitter. Yeah, it is challenging
01:01:51 I go to the like do I do I just have to scroll for like 20 minutes? Yes. I don't want to do that
01:01:57 Yeah, it sucks. It's a nightmare
01:02:00 Hey, well, hey on this subject
01:02:02 I started this this particular tangent by being like, uh, yeah
01:02:05 We aguas are going to be retired for some time and I'm trying other stuff
01:02:08 And I'm really I am excited about that because I'm hoping to like use my my editor bro to like
01:02:14 Help get more quality stuff out that people like and are excited about and I can get
01:02:18 I don't know like little thoughts out quickly while I work on the big stuff in like a format
01:02:22 That's just a little more just has a little more life to it than we agua
01:02:26 Which I think I did a pretty interesting analysis on my patreon, which is free
01:02:29 So if you want to hear my full thoughts, you should check that out just out of interest
01:02:33 But um, but also like this talk about like radcon 4 and like as soon as we had a plan
01:02:39 As soon as we like all the obstacles were gone like boom. We're making it happen right now. That's really exciting
01:02:44 Uh, fucking me and digi working on cantons. I'll just tell I mean we are currently working on what's effectively the spiritual successor to the weebcast
01:02:53 And then I was just like hey did you what if we like got some guests and did you like
01:02:56 Let's fucking reach out to some people
01:02:58 And so we don't know if anyone's going to happen with that
01:03:00 But people loved the weebcast and we're hoping to like keep that going to some degree now that like cantons like the perfect channel for that
01:03:07 And uh, I don't know we're talking about maybe getting like an editor
01:03:10 Working on that to help us out or something
01:03:12 And this is just many things seem very positive right now and I'm very much looking forward to this upcoming year
01:03:18 So uh, and it's not that I'm just dreaming of it. We're actually doing all of these things currently
01:03:23 So I'm very excited about it. Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm feeling very positive. What can I say? What can I say?
01:03:29 Hopefully things work out for the best
01:03:32 Uh
01:03:33 Fuck yeah, I mean I'm
01:03:35 I think I feel I'm feeling pretty optimistic. I'm feeling like
01:03:39 I'm feeling like I've got room to grow. I'm feeling like I've gotten new venues to branch out into that's exciting
01:03:47 Yeah, you know speaking about like youtube
01:03:51 just
01:03:52 doing videos I was
01:03:54 I was considering
01:03:56 because like um
01:03:58 For for no particular reason
01:03:59 I was on rusty cages channel because I'd never really looked into that guy and it turns out he makes
01:04:05 Like he's quite popular. I didn't actually realize that I thought mplemon was the big the big boy in that that whole like um
01:04:12 Friend of youtube
01:04:14 Yeah, but like rusty cages like he's got actually really great music and I like that
01:04:19 Um, but he's like he's he's quite a creative guy and he's got a webcomic or not a webcomic an actual
01:04:25 um
01:04:25 Requiem of the crazies requiem of the crazies and it's like a big like serious project that he's been working on for years
01:04:32 Rusty rusty seems really cool. Did you yeah, he like apparently he like um
01:04:38 Apparently he made a lot of money like winning like knife game contests or like
01:04:44 Like like or maybe not night. No, it was some contest that involved knives
01:04:48 Okay, but he like he just like won a whole bunch of money like doing that
01:04:52 And like I think that was before he was a youtuber even i'm not sure
01:04:56 Are we talking like millions here? Are we talking like more? You know, I don't know
01:05:00 Okay, like I'm just stuff maybe tens of thousands or you know enough enough to live on for a while
01:05:06 Or I'm not I actually have no idea. I just heard the second hand. So I don't know the details
01:05:10 Yeah, but anyway, he he made that one video explaining that he was going to try and focus on this comic
01:05:17 And you know make a whole chapter and you know stuff like that and I watched this video and he talks to
01:05:22 um
01:05:24 The the guy who made earthworm jim who has like his own youtube show. I saw that I saw that yeah
01:05:29 And he was giving advice and it was like I was listening because it was like obviously
01:05:33 Useful advice for me as well because I'm thinking of doing or I am doing comics now
01:05:38 And he was saying that you know, there's no reason to get like published by a publisher when you have this internet
01:05:47 Presence it, you know
01:05:48 Rusty is obviously very um, he's got like a few hundred thousands of subscribers
01:05:53 He can get this comic out to a lot of people. He's a million. He's a million subscriber boys, isn't he? I think so
01:05:59 Oh, is he?
01:06:01 I was it was a the knife the knife game song went like
01:06:04 Really popular like back in the day. Is that views or is that subscribers? You got 1.38 million. There you go
01:06:10 That's that yeah, holy shit. All right. I misread that as well. But yeah
01:06:15 He's got a big platform and for that reason his
01:06:20 it's quite easy for him
01:06:22 comparatively to
01:06:23 Launch a comic off the back of because of the amount of eyeballs he can get to his thing and it's like true
01:06:30 Maybe maybe it's not such a bad idea to do youtube for just that purpose if that would help
01:06:37 Yeah, because it's not like rusty has made comic videos the entire time. He just makes things
01:06:42 He makes videos about all sorts of things like any any platform that you establish a presence on you can use it to
01:06:50 like siphon
01:06:52 Views from it to anywhere else you want to them to go. Yeah true true
01:06:57 I was just thinking about that. I don't know whether I would go like
01:07:00 Come back full on like hypocrite in the same because it's that sort of stuff is
01:07:06 Very time consuming. I would probably be yeah, I probably but basically I'd be a come a big old sell out
01:07:12 And I try to get as much subscribers as possible completely cynically
01:07:16 But I don't know whether that's also either that is the is the best way to go about it. I might have to like
01:07:22 Figure out some sort of hybrid that is satisfying enough for the old fans and then can get lots of new fans
01:07:29 And then build that up just in the background somehow. I don't know these things can be challenging
01:07:34 I mean, I think we've been trying
01:07:36 But I mean one of the things I'm doing with reagua is like I think people are just I certainly feel exhausted with like
01:07:42 An attempt to play the algorithm and when I look at everybody else, I mean just do what the fuck you want
01:07:47 I saved up money so I could do what I want. So fuck it. I'm just gonna make the projects
01:07:52 That I feel like making and if I die, well, fuck it. I'll look. I've got a good degree
01:07:57 I've worked in a job if I lose all my money. I'll just fuck off get a job
01:08:01 Do youtube temporarily for a while and then try this thing again in a couple years once I've saved up money
01:08:06 Uh, you know, I'll be fine. So I'm not worried about me with the thing with like playing the algorithm
01:08:12 Is that none of us were
01:08:14 willing to go
01:08:15 Full shill we can't go Jeff. I can't do it. I just can't do it
01:08:19 It makes me want to die like if we can't if we can't do that then we don't
01:08:23 You can't expect to to game the algorithm because I was saying the other day using creative
01:08:28 Creativity points you're gonna run out of those
01:08:30 I was saying that I think reagua was the worst possible combination of too much production value meaning it takes up too much time
01:08:38 and
01:08:39 And also not enough to be justified in people waiting for it or whatever the worst possible middle ground is how I think it
01:08:46 Ended up. Um, whereas opposed to like some people spam every day a bunch of videos. That's fine
01:08:50 Or you make one a month and that's, you know, really nice or whatever
01:08:53 There's a bunch of youtubers that I watch like they do
01:08:56 Take sponsorships and they do ads
01:08:59 But they do them in a way that is just like openly
01:09:02 Disdainful of the thing and like I would somehow they somehow they keep getting like the the offers
01:09:09 And like they just keep doing it and like I guess it's just fine
01:09:14 I mean, what's the what's the purpose of advertising to increase brand awareness primarily just so that when that person
01:09:20 Thinks of oh, I need to buy this product
01:09:23 What comes to their mind is the thing that that youtuber was shitting on just because it's the first thing they think of
01:09:29 And so in that way, maybe it's fulfilling. It's it's need probably if they're saying a boost in sales
01:09:34 I guess like like we all need to get into that rage shadow legends of money
01:09:37 Like like like big joe will just end a video with like by the way guys
01:09:42 This video is sponsored by squarespace. You know, I always wanted to make
01:09:47 A website about like how much I love mayonnaise
01:09:51 So I I made a website and I put a picture of mayonnaise on it. Whoo squarespace and like that's the ad
01:09:57 Yeah
01:09:58 You know, that that's a minimal level of selling out
01:10:02 Very minimal very minimal. I don't know. I don't know. How does he how does he get away with it?
01:10:06 This mad is amazing
01:10:09 I like jesse's um
01:10:11 Squarespace fake ad where it's like a space where you put squares
01:10:17 You got squares. Here's a space for them. Somehow. I never figured that out as a pun
01:10:22 Of possibility. It's just so obvious. I still don't get it, but I'm laughing
01:10:28 It's if you got squares, this is the place. What? This is the space to put your
01:10:32 Squarespace
01:10:36 Expecting a lot from this over here, you know, just some high tier word play
01:10:43 Some high t word play for us low t
01:10:50 I mean my onions
01:10:52 I'm gonna make some curry later and put some onions in there. Oh, it's I was thinking of getting into curry
01:10:57 You've planted the seed get into it, bro. Join me on the curry train
01:11:00 Yes, your your sodium will go up, but it's worth it. Pay that piper pay that piper
01:11:06 It's the best food I've ever eaten in my life and I made it
01:11:08 I bought a big bag of fucking sweet potatoes fucking yams
01:11:12 I cannot wait to put that in my new fucking curry and enjoy that. It's the best part of the curry
01:11:17 Fuck the meat. It's all about the sweet potatoes. That's the best part. No, let's fuck this fucked up, man
01:11:23 I know it sounds insane, but it's true
01:11:25 It's true. I mean, I do love when you're low t you get into sweet potatoes, I guess
01:11:30 Yeah, yeah, so they're full of phytoestrogens, bro
01:11:33 Oh, shit, bro. I can feel my gains draining from my body
01:11:37 That's like you hear about the uh, the miracle burger is uh full of estrogen or whatever is like a fake
01:11:45 The sex change those damn globalists will stop at nothing to drain america sounds like a conspiracy to normalize trans people
01:11:53 We can't have that to normalize trans facts, but we won't allow it and I think
01:11:58 Probably it's against my judaeo christian values somehow. I don't know the chapter and verse, but I'm sure it's in there somewhere
01:12:05 I've no doubt. I've no doubt. Don't eat my discomfort. It's definitely a moral obligation, right? It's not just that. I'm not used to it
01:12:11 It's that I it's morally wrong
01:12:14 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think so and
01:12:18 gross
01:12:19 God created the biggest sin of all and yucky
01:12:24 Ew gross nasty
01:12:26 Uh, well, I want we could move to the fuck are we all are we all fucked out?
01:12:30 Are we all have we fucked one another enough for our time being are we all satisfied? I'm satisfied with the sex we've had today
01:12:37 Oh, yeah
01:12:38 Okay, I think we've had some positive exchanges here. So
01:12:43 We're all positive fluid exchanges. You know what I'm saying
01:12:48 If you catch my innuendo, I caught more than you in the window you bastard
01:12:53 Uh, well, all right speak pipe link boys and girls down below in the description
01:12:58 Uh, you can call it you can click on it. You can leave us voicemails if they're good
01:13:01 We will respond it on the show like you're about to see here before you on this very day
01:13:06 So first up to the gate to the slaughter is pancakes with craters
01:13:11 Why is our first voicemail? Let's hear why indeed go
01:13:17 Okay, pcp. We know how the views of game review channels usually work
01:13:22 They got they get about one two million views tops depending on the channel
01:13:28 There's a channel used to be called classic game room now going by the name 80s comics that has a video
01:13:34 Called classic game room hd
01:13:38 Ben 10 alien force for the we
01:13:41 review
01:13:42 And it has over
01:13:43 55 million views
01:13:48 Now this video is not special. It is no different than any of the other videos he does
01:13:53 I'm just wondering how such an oddity
01:13:56 Can occur
01:13:57 on youtube kids
01:13:59 It's the bats phenomenon. Yeah, I was thinking of the bat. I thought of bats as well. Yeah
01:14:04 Jesse's video bats that just has five million views for like no good reason. It doesn't make any sense
01:14:08 It is great video, but you know still the algorithm
01:14:12 Sometimes it just grabs one and it just shares it to everybody and this one does sound like the algorithm just grabs shit
01:14:18 Like I remember uh a few months ago everyone was weirded out because like it just put uh mkbhd's first video
01:14:25 He ever did and the algorithm was showing up and everyone's recommended
01:14:28 And it's like from when he was like 15 reviewing an old hp computer that nobody cared about and the quality was shit
01:14:35 Everyone's like, why is this like popular right now? Like what made this relevant?
01:14:39 Who's very strange man? Speaking of the algorithm, uh
01:14:42 chris chan and also speaking of rad con and lectures chris chan lecture is like
01:14:47 It's gonna hit a million views in like it might have hit a million views by the time that this uh episode goes
01:14:52 Oh, holy shit. It's gonna. It's like four. It's like four. It's like four thousand away. God damn
01:14:58 but then and and also it's seeing a spike in views but simultaneously the uh the like
01:15:04 Ad revenue like cost per mil is like just like plummeted
01:15:08 So it's like getting like more views than usual, but it's making less money than usual and it's pissing me off
01:15:14 And I don't like probably because it's not advertiser friendly
01:15:17 It nothing changed. It's the same video youtube's policy change. It's the new year
01:15:23 YouTube's no policies continue. I mean it could be something as simple as
01:15:27 Because like it you get paid based on what ads are actually served
01:15:30 So maybe it's happened to have like a batch of ads that don't pay as much
01:15:34 That is theoretically possible. Well, they nothing is lost. Stop it. Yeah, you should give me the good ads, please
01:15:41 Oh, just just for posterity sake. I found the tweet twitter has like apparently a search feature, but it's terrible
01:15:48 Uh, I found the sonic the hedgehog tweet. It has 15 000 likes and 3 000 retweets
01:15:55 Goodness gracious. Yeah, it was it was you posting it
01:15:58 Uh, I can I can yeah, why not? Let's let the people I've seen it before but posted anyway. All right. I'll I'll link it
01:16:05 Or I'll try it. I'm just clicking on on jesse's bat's review. Uh, a manchild, ink formally
01:16:12 Shit, what was it formally horseshoe reviews and I remember drying horseshoes. Yeah, horseshoes. Yeah, and it's
01:16:18 5.3 million views. That's fucking insane. I would be
01:16:22 It would be pretty cool
01:16:23 Sonic the hedgehog 20. That's it's good. It's great. All you need. Yeah, everybody loves this
01:16:28 It would be pretty cool if uh, my lecture saw big spike in views when I hit a million
01:16:34 Maybe it will be nice. It'll probably just keep on chugging
01:16:38 I mean a million views on a lecture is fucking amazing. So I can't hear anyone. Hang on
01:16:43 So what you get that that low low quality kami microphone?
01:16:47 Ben when are you gonna get a fucking real?
01:16:50 Microphone get an 80 2020 and a scarlet solo like indeed probably all in all with the mic arm probably like a
01:16:56 Six seven hundred dollar investment all told if you're gonna start doing wait six seven hundred dollars
01:17:02 I mean, there's the microphone. That's like four hundred dollars. The mic arm is a hundred dollars. Wait, what?
01:17:08 An 80 2020 do I have a 20 20 or 40 40?
01:17:12 I have a 80 2020. So I have a 40 40 like the upgrade. Okay. That's why that's that's the difference
01:17:18 You spend four hundred dollars on a microphone. I think so pretty sure
01:17:21 Why youtube compresses audio, there's no reason to spend more than a hundred dollars
01:17:25 From econ for ten dollars. Nice. It's got that snow. Got that snowball ice, baby
01:17:33 I am very satisfied with the performance of this microphone as my one mic for everything for the last like
01:17:38 It's just so overkill. That's so overkill
01:17:42 I mean, it's like big dick energy for sure, but like jesus
01:17:47 I mean, you're not wrong. You're not wrong. But hey, let's not let's consider the fact at the time
01:17:51 I was a employed programmer with a stable job and had income at the time
01:17:58 You could have bought an 80 2020 and a ps4 pro. What were you thinking? That's not very gamer of you fair enough
01:18:04 All right. Well, whatever. Whatever we're talking about. Let's just go to the next fucking voicemail. Uh, les are okay. We're back, buddy
01:18:09 We're back. All right. Wait, where are we off? Are we off?
01:18:13 Uh, we're talking about what was the voicemail? I don't remember. Uh
01:18:18 Pancakes with craters. What about eliezer? Did he send a voicemail in? Oh, well, no, I just said like he would cut this section
01:18:23 When you died, we said to cut that part out. It's fine. I mean, I came back almost in like two minutes. You did well
01:18:28 Shit, well, we're still addressing it. Do you want to keep eliezer? If this part's interesting, keep it
01:18:32 Ah, shit. All right. We'll no matter. All right. You can be the judge. I guess. Let's go to our next voicemail
01:18:36 Anyway, which is from the puppet master. Uh, let's hear what he has to say
01:18:41 Go. Oh, hello. This is comrade now from the pc fc pc rsh
01:18:46 I have another comrade. Yes, welcome to speak to you. We are covering over the transfragistrnia transmitter
01:18:52 Okay, I'm going to print him in there. Okay. Goodbye
01:18:57 Bye
01:19:00 Hello
01:19:02 um
01:19:03 So this is not another episode in the communist hell saga
01:19:07 But it is somewhat related and I'd like to speak to
01:19:11 digi in particular
01:19:12 If he's on this episode, but I guess all of you
01:19:15 lol
01:19:17 Okay, a big problem that I think a lot of people have is starting a project
01:19:22 And just, you know losing interest in it and not finishing it and I guess digi is
01:19:28 You know, he's the one who's kind of known for that, but um, I'm just curious, uh
01:19:33 How do you guys deal with that partially, uh, you know, how do you yeah?
01:19:37 Stop yourself. How do you keep your in keep yourself interested in whatever project you're working on?
01:19:44 and uh
01:19:46 I don't know
01:19:47 For the more autistic pc p members. Uh, does being autistic
01:19:53 Help you in any way to stay interested and to be really obsessed with your projects such that you can finish them
01:20:00 Did you poison your mind bro?
01:20:03 I can't
01:20:04 Anyway, thanks guys
01:20:07 Talk to you later. Does being autistic like help you focus on your project, dude? Is that like helpful for you?
01:20:12 Shut up. Oh, that's oh is that what yeah, that's fucking stupid god. I mean, that's really dumb
01:20:17 So no ignoring that have I gone on record enough times to saying how much I hate the fucking digi autism meme
01:20:23 It's fine as a joke that one could use in a funny goofy way
01:20:26 But this guy's taking it too seriously. I can already tell uh chill bro chill
01:20:30 All right beyond that
01:20:33 The way to finish project, uh, you utilize you got to utilize your mind's weaknesses against itself
01:20:39 You got to weaponize your own cognitive biases
01:20:43 For example the sunk cost effect, right? Oh, yeah, that's a good one
01:20:47 I've put so much effort into slime and punishment that I can't possibly live with myself if I don't finish it
01:20:52 I know I I must do it
01:20:55 Um, even even if I even if I like even if I lost all enthusiasm for it
01:21:01 Like I would still have to do it or I would just um
01:21:04 Or I like like the pain I would experience from not finishing it is worse than than the suffering
01:21:09 I would have to go through to slog through to the end
01:21:12 um
01:21:13 So
01:21:15 Person finally stop
01:21:18 Like they they they've been on hiatus for a million years and then they finally said actually i'm just gonna not do it
01:21:23 Maybe release the rest of the the story is text. I think davoo told me about that
01:21:28 I didn't know but that's interesting. She's been doing enough like a million fucking years. Yeah
01:21:34 Uh, I mean, okay. This is a complicated question the real answer. I would say it's it's a multi-faceted one
01:21:40 Okay, like one here's how you retain enthusiasm. There's a bunch of ways one finish the project fast
01:21:48 Don't like if you just get it out fast. Oh, you don't have time to regret it
01:21:52 Like that's important like work like finish it like like go at it with furious energy
01:21:56 Yeah, uh terrified because if you like like like the sort of dam
01:22:01 Whenever you're working on something on a long-term project or even a short-term project
01:22:05 The sort of damocles is always over your head and that sort of damocles is boredom at some point
01:22:10 You don't know when it will drop and you will start to hate the thing you're working on
01:22:14 So it's always a race against time weaponize that initial burst of energy as much as you can
01:22:20 The way to think about it really is
01:22:22 is that um
01:22:24 Every project is really hard to get off the ground and you need a lot of motivation and an you know excitement to get you like
01:22:33 Accelerate it like you start at zero speed and you're trying to build up speed
01:22:37 Uh, and once you're going it's easier to keep going
01:22:40 Um, a lot of the time if you take a break you slow down and if you take a break for too long
01:22:45 You slow down to zero and then yeah without that initial without the initial spark
01:22:51 You have to somehow get back to the speed you were before and it's very demoralizing
01:22:55 Trying to do that and failing over and over again to get back to the right speed and then you know
01:23:01 Every failure becomes more of a failure more of a reason that you fail the next time
01:23:06 Let's consider this in context though because the guy who's calling in is of course
01:23:10 I mean the puppet master
01:23:12 I I don't know if you said that before but this is the guy who was doing like the communist hell
01:23:16 Uh, like chairman Mao and I don't know who else so he's so like he's tired of that
01:23:20 I guess it sounds to me if I I mean he didn't say this but inferring as I am with my big brain
01:23:25 I would guess that he's referring probably to this narrative and
01:23:28 Like I was just saying like being if you got it done fast and conclude it. That's fine. Here's another important one
01:23:34 I suspect you didn't have like a vision in your mind for how to end this thing and that's fine
01:23:39 I would say that like having that is important because one of the important things to do is not let the scope
01:23:45 Drift out of your control so that one you don't even know what to do with it and two
01:23:49 Even if you knew it would take so much energy to actually finish it that that in of itself is intimidating and
01:23:56 demoralizing so like if you if you have the desire first of all
01:24:00 I release you from any obligation to end the communist hell saga. We all enjoyed it. It was lots of fun
01:24:06 You do not have to conclude it in any big epic way or anything like that
01:24:10 But if you wanted to it sounds like you probably don't have a plan right now
01:24:13 I would just say if why not do just like one final thing
01:24:16 Take like the 10 minutes write down just a couple of lines. You think it'd be a funny way to like maybe hell explodes
01:24:22 I don't know. Everyone goes to heaven. Uh epic goof. I don't know whatever whatever the fuck you want to do
01:24:27 But you gotta don't do that. That sucks. Sure. That sucks
01:24:30 But there's something that doesn't suck but like make it well make just narrow down your work by giving you something not
01:24:35 Have a goal. Use those smart goals
01:24:38 Here's my like big brain idea for for how this works. Yeah the
01:24:43 A lot of the advice is plan better and make sure that you don't slow down
01:24:50 But if you're already in that funk
01:24:52 Um, I think the best thing to do if you really just
01:24:56 You don't like you don't have a clear goal for where you're going and you feel bad that you're not doing anything
01:25:01 But you also don't want to do it. Just cancel it
01:25:04 There's no there's no like
01:25:06 Yeah, um, there's no shame in cancelling a project so that you can work on something that will actually get done
01:25:12 If you're just if you just don't want to do it, right?
01:25:15 Then just like if you're at the point where you're like, I don't want to be satisfied with communist hell
01:25:19 If that's what you're talking about. I feel no need. I don't I'm not even I'm not talking about communist
01:25:24 I'm just talking janitor. I don't know. Is this about communist?
01:25:28 I'm inferring it. I don't know for sure
01:25:30 It's not clear anything if you just if you don't want to do it anymore, and they just don't do it
01:25:33 Uh, and like, yeah, well the the reason I feel like
01:25:37 Confident and happy about this lord of ghost comic is because I planned it all out before I started like quote unquote started
01:25:44 um before I announced it and
01:25:46 The whole thing is planned out from beginning to end and I like, you know
01:25:49 I I wrote the entire thing and then did like a screenplay with dialogue before I started drawing
01:25:55 You know the pre-production is integral to making sure the the process of making it goes very smoothly
01:26:01 And so because I did a lot of pre-production
01:26:03 I'm confident it can work if I just went into it and
01:26:07 You know had the same lofty ideals of how big it would be and how long it would go
01:26:12 But had no real plan to fall back on it would be much easier for me to take a break
01:26:17 And then lose momentum and then want to quit because I didn't know what I was doing
01:26:21 and so the pre-production
01:26:23 is
01:26:24 It allows me to maintain my
01:26:28 My speed so that I can get to the end of the project as fast as possible and and not slow down at any point
01:26:35 um
01:26:36 And that's why I know that's that's gonna work
01:26:39 So it's it's it's it's really just a matter of planning out these projects beforehand
01:26:43 That's the main thing similarly if you're going into a project with no plan
01:26:47 It's okay for like it to just be shit like the um
01:26:53 Yeah, the the canon story comic I I made I made um
01:26:58 Just because why not I was bored or something
01:27:01 I I forget the reason but I thought wouldn't it be cool to do that during a stream and I did a stream
01:27:06 Where I drew a comic panel and then saw what happens next and then it was finished in the stream
01:27:13 And it was incredibly low quality
01:27:16 But the fact that it was a project that was started and finished really quickly
01:27:20 It didn't matter the the motivation like the the happiness that came from a completed project no matter how shit it was
01:27:27 Was like powerful enough to spark the next one which was bell shape
01:27:31 And that one did have a lot of hurdles because I did slow down at points
01:27:36 Um, I just really really wanted it to be finished
01:27:39 But yeah, yeah, it's it. There's no problem with like
01:27:43 quitting if you have no idea of what to do next or
01:27:48 desire to continue
01:27:51 I think he's gotten plenty of advice on this friend especially especially if like
01:27:56 To continue something you would have to like not do another thing that maybe yeah, you would be more interested in
01:28:03 Yeah
01:28:04 Yeah, we've he's heard enough. Yeah enough for you
01:28:08 Or spend too much time with his asshole. It's mostly just me boasting
01:28:12 That's all right. We've got a message here
01:28:15 Titled pokemon sword and shield. Let's quickly shift into the pokemon podcast people in the comments people in the comments
01:28:23 Said that tom the guy who wrote the christmas carol about me. Yeah, he should be him. He should be in voice grail
01:28:28 I don't know. I don't want to go very true back and nominate him for voice. Absolutely true. All right, tom
01:28:34 Tom's going in voice grail. No other tom. Yeah, not this guy's not good enough. You haven't pulled your way. All right, tom
01:28:41 No, no, no. I'll get there someday. Tom more like tomb
01:28:46 To me for christmas. Please kill Ben saying I hate him. Yeah, it's all good stuff. All right
01:28:51 Next voicemail right pokemon sword and shield. Let's hear what he has to say. Take it away
01:28:55 Hey, mr. Best guy ever in your content video
01:28:59 You talked about the trs and pokemon sword and shield and how you didn't know what it was
01:29:04 If you go to one of the guys in the town there, he's all like bro. It's so vintage. It's vinyl. They're vinyls
01:29:10 They're records. It's technical records. They they look like records and they break and they suck because they're records
01:29:17 And it's vintage and then the tms
01:29:19 Are technical like machines or some shit and they're like cds
01:29:23 That's all I have to say. It's do what you will with that information. Okay
01:29:27 Thank you for the okay in in pokemon sword and shield
01:29:31 There are tms. You know tms now are multi use you can use them in infinite number of times
01:29:36 But they also introduced this thing called tr as you get in the max raid battles that are
01:29:40 They're they're they're the old like one time use version of tms
01:29:43 So you might get a tr of earthquake you can use it one time and then oh items destroyed
01:29:48 So now i'm getting it. It's like wait. Okay, it's like old tms. I don't do they look like do they look like records?
01:29:55 They look they're
01:29:57 Black as opposed to the other cds of tms that are like whitish. So there is a difference there. Yeah, I guess that makes sense
01:30:04 That seems
01:30:06 It seems obvious. I well, I don't know. I just see a tr and it's a different color
01:30:12 I'm still confused as to what a tm is exactly. Oh wait
01:30:16 Like how does a cd teach a pokemon a move? It looks like a disc based based on how it looks when you apply them in the gba games
01:30:22 You basically glue it to their head and then it absorbs into their body and now they know something
01:30:27 I know I've said this in the past, but in the pokemon adventures comic
01:30:31 I believe by the way, I finally found the serial experiments lane tweet. It's not actually that much. Oh good
01:30:36 It just is a lot for me. Okay. We'll say 500 retweets and about a thousand likes. I mean that's that's good
01:30:41 That's good. And yeah, this is great. Um, but uh, that is so much better than my tweet
01:30:45 I hate on this subject of technical
01:30:48 Machines whatever in the pokemon adventures manga read
01:30:52 At one point when he's battling someone he he has an evie and he uses a tm on evie
01:30:57 And I remember vividly because I was so freaked out by this
01:31:00 He what he does is he has like two pieces of a machine. It apparently is a tm
01:31:05 It's it's like a box. It's like a box
01:31:07 He pulls it apart holds the pieces on either side of an evie's head and we can see like a data stream
01:31:13 Like pass in between or something and it's like sticking it was teaching it mimic or whatever
01:31:19 He's teaching his evie a move via this like weird data stream or something
01:31:23 But it's the it's a disc now. You can't do that with a disc. I don't understand
01:31:28 I mean the manga the mangas aren't the mangas aren't canon. So what are you gonna do?
01:31:33 I think I've been confused for a long time on this whole just throw it like a shuriken and they catch it
01:31:38 Yeah
01:31:39 That'll do the job. Okay. Anyway, it's a rocket. I'm trying to I'm trying to find a picture of the sprite
01:31:44 Because I want to see what they actually look like so I can make fun of you for not getting it
01:31:48 It's just I don't know 25. They don't even show it in game. It's just like in the inventory
01:31:54 It's they don't have a sprite like items, right? They do Ben just google tm 25 in the menu or whatever. It doesn't matter and go to bulbapedia
01:32:00 tm 25 that that's thunder and just click on it and it'll show you there's like this yellow disc and that's what
01:32:05 Yeah, but that's a tm. I what does a tr look like? Oh, oh shit. It's that but black. He has like a black
01:32:12 Fuck. Okay. I can't remember. Do the trs have names. Are they numbered?
01:32:17 Yeah, they're the same the numbers are the same. They're just you know
01:32:21 I'm searching tr 25 bulbapedia
01:32:24 Got it. Okay. This is apparently scy shock here here. I'm putting the show notes. Enjoy everyone this link to tr 25 scy shock
01:32:32 There you go. Click on it. You'll see it just as black okay black edges
01:32:35 Oh, that's a record dude. I didn't okay now. I know that's a record. That's what a record looks like
01:32:42 Unable to bun guy everybody
01:32:46 That's a that's a great day of cosplay
01:32:49 Yeah, I don't oh wait. It's not cut. It's like this is like proto-dave at the beginning of the series. Yeah
01:32:54 Well, I'm wait fighting. Well, what's what's what color is red? I guess fire
01:32:59 This one's pink. So it's a scy shock. So it's a psychic move. I guess so we need we need a fire type tr
01:33:04 Oh, yeah, that'd be perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Anyway, uh, let's move on to our next voicemail
01:33:10 let me see this one is uh
01:33:13 Oh, she she pollution she pollution who I believe is called in before but uh, let's see what they got for us. Go
01:33:18 Hey guys, happy new year. Hello. So every new year. I thought it would be fun for you guys to do some predictions about
01:33:26 2030 like for example
01:33:29 Does the piece piece still exist?
01:33:32 or
01:33:32 Um, YouTube is no longer the place for most people watch your videos, you know, maybe a new platform has been created
01:33:39 So, yeah, I thought it would be fun for you guys to do these predictions so that in 10 years
01:33:42 We can listen back to this podcast and see if you guys were correct
01:33:47 I hope you have fun. Okay. Well, see you in 10 years. Bye. See you then buddy
01:33:52 If if the another prediction if a prediction of like youtube won't be around is correct
01:33:57 We won't be able to come back and check that we were correct. Well, this does exist on other formats. It's on
01:34:02 Yeah, yeah, you know other podcast format itunes and a couple other places
01:34:07 Um, you'll have you'll have to pledge to our patreon
01:34:10 Secret bonus the old bonus content now lost to time everywhere else. Damn true. Um
01:34:17 I think I think I think I mean
01:34:21 For myself like my plan in life is like maybe even if um, like
01:34:28 I have to get like a real job again. I'm still gonna do like all my internet stuff
01:34:32 I just won't be as you know, I don't have as much time. So I'm gonna keep doing it pretty much no matter what
01:34:37 I'll be cringe posting till the day I die
01:34:40 I saw ben. I loved your tweet the other day that here it is my final cringe post of the decade
01:34:47 I thought of that the day before and I was like, but I can't post it today
01:34:50 You gotta wait because then I I can't post until the end of the year
01:34:52 So I had to wait until the day the last day cringe posting later that day
01:34:56 It's like I gotta make my final cringe
01:34:59 You technically posted it within January 1st in my time. Your time zone is not real
01:35:06 So if you ever tried the cringe post in the uk, oh, oh, yeah, I'll bring it up. You're not allowed. You're not allowed
01:35:11 Hey, you said you said it was your last one. You said
01:35:16 Um, okay. Well, you took exist. What do you think? I'm sorry to break it to you, but I'm sure I have many more cringe posts in me
01:35:21 Over the coming decade
01:35:23 All right, so short version I I plan on working with you guys in some version for for a long time
01:35:29 So I think the pcp in some form
01:35:31 I plan on throwing all of you under the bus. Yeah, that'll be good to gain clout for myself. Oh, yeah
01:35:37 Well, I yeah, that's been obvious for a while. Yeah, that's as soon as possible
01:35:41 I plan on teleporting behind you so that the bus kills both of us
01:35:45 great
01:35:48 Biting my time for the perfect opportunity to jump ship as this whole thing crashes and burns
01:35:53 So I can escape scoffing want the pcp to exist. I mean 10 years is a long time. We'll be like 40 basically at that time
01:36:00 Um, I will be 40. I'll be I'll be technically just under 40, but I hope I hope the pcp
01:36:07 Doesn't exist not because like I I hope we all
01:36:11 Like fall out. Yeah, I definitely hope we're all still friends, but I hope that we're all like
01:36:17 More professionals you hope that we found something better to do
01:36:21 Yeah, like like I would still love to talk with you. I'm not holding my breath
01:36:24 I was still loved like I would love for like tom to be a game developer
01:36:28 Uh, I would love I mean, you know, if that's what you you're going for
01:36:32 Yeah, like for all of our projects
01:36:34 We're working on now to be like more upgraded versions by that right right did she will probably have a kid and that would be funny
01:36:41 You know you guys yeah the biggest downgrade of all by that time frame. I plan on having a kid or two. Yeah, so you know
01:36:48 They can oh my god, they can start the new pcp
01:36:52 Oh, that's their destiny. They can start content is just a fucking
01:36:58 Trojan horse to like to have the dads hang out. Oh, that sounds fine. Maybe we could have them on
01:37:03 No, we should we should re-brand us like the dad the old dad
01:37:07 Oh, they could make a our children could make the pre teen cp. You know, it'll be
01:37:12 Hey, anyone who donates $10,000 to the Kickstarter gets to name digi's kid
01:37:18 We're not going to tell him that
01:37:21 We're gonna sneak in and and and and write on the birth certificate before he can
01:37:28 Yes, this is all great. This is all gold. That's so seriously if you're a dad, you're kicked from the pcp
01:37:33 I don't make the rules. I just thank you. Thank you. I mean, okay
01:37:38 I think I
01:37:40 Personally like my goals are I would love if my channel could get big and I make a million billion dollars. Yay, wouldn't that be nice?
01:37:47 I'm gonna I still want like my goal in life is to make good youtube videos that people find entertaining and hopefully interesting
01:37:55 Uh, and I'm gonna try to make them better and better as I go
01:37:58 So, I mean, I I want to do that. That's the thing I want to do. Maybe I'll like work with more editors
01:38:03 Maybe I'll try to make them fancy or whatever. I don't know, but that's what I want to be doing
01:38:07 Yeah, what I want to be doing is making comics and yeah, like writing for movies and and doing all that cool
01:38:14 Shit by that point definitely something that I've been working on will be out from my writing work
01:38:19 Sure, sure, and then I'll be like, uh getting money from it or something
01:38:23 I have some desire to crack into voice acting to some degree, but that's kind of on the back burner
01:38:27 So I'm not I have some desire to voice crack
01:38:32 Oh
01:38:34 Happens when you least expect it, you know, I'd like to I'd like to sound a bit of this voice crack storyboard for cartoons
01:38:39 I think I could do that really good. I could do that real good
01:38:43 I know the guy who uh used to make that webcomic three-word phrase got a job storyboarding for regular show man
01:38:50 I'm sure it's like hard, but like it looks so fucking easy. Sure. Sure. It looks so easy
01:38:57 Yeah, uh, I want to do storyboards for family guy personally. Uh, I want to
01:39:03 Be like uh lois
01:39:06 Forget about it
01:39:10 His classic line forget about it lois. Um, that's what I'm looking forward to that's gonna be my career
01:39:16 Uh, other than that, I'd like to live in a nicer place. I want to leave the ghetto
01:39:20 Um, you know, I guess this isn't really in keeping with the spray. He has four predictions
01:39:25 Yeah, I was gonna say so like will youtube still exist. What do you think about youtube?
01:39:29 I think youtube will still exist. I mean facebook. I think youtube will
01:39:32 Uh, uh, what's the word?
01:39:35 My space still exists. Uh, so it's just I don't think youtube will be nearly as relevant
01:39:40 I think micro content is gonna start taking over. I think i don't think so. I don't think so reduce people's standards
01:39:46 I don't think I would like that but I don't think the idea of like youtube as a platform will probably exist
01:39:52 It may not be on youtube, but like so many people are so used to this sort of media
01:39:57 I think it'll be hard to just suddenly disappear for sure youtube will exist
01:40:01 I think that more
01:40:03 I don't like I don't think like a direct youtube competitor will like overtake it
01:40:07 But I think that like alternative platforms that like maybe cover some of the youtube niche will become more viable
01:40:14 Yeah, I think so they're starting. Yeah
01:40:17 Um, there will there will be not there will be not direct competitors
01:40:20 But there will be viable like pseudo competitors and probably like them the the the platforms will diversify
01:40:27 I think youtube will continue to become more commercial and so that'll force underground creators to go somewhere else. Yeah
01:40:33 I possibly in in 30 years
01:40:37 Uh, I'm not 30 years. I mean the next decade
01:40:40 2030 I hope by that point we will have
01:40:44 VR
01:40:45 Games that are actually good games because you admit they're not good right now
01:40:49 I fucking proved it everybody. He admits it that I'm right about vr games. There's a couple good video games
01:40:56 There's a couple good video games, but like I've never felt the urge to go and play a video game in vr
01:41:01 Maybe the half-life one like I've tried it out and it's been it's been it's been like quite nice
01:41:06 But did I bring my did I bring my um oculus to rad con three? No, but you should bring it to rad con four
01:41:14 Yeah, I'll bring it to rag them for we can all play fucking. Yes. I want to play super hot so bad in vr
01:41:19 That's the one game. I actually want to play sounds fucking sick. Okay. Fuck. Yeah. Nice
01:41:24 I didn't actually mean vr. I was going to say something else. Oh, well, still it's a good idea
01:41:27 Like just just general technology improvements, but like I was trying to think of some
01:41:32 Interesting thing, but of course I've got a bold prediction. I don't make technology
01:41:35 I don't know how but of course you couldn't think of anything interesting you idiot. No
01:41:41 I'm just a creative I suspect
01:41:44 That here's a here's a bold prediction during the next 10 years
01:41:49 effectively
01:41:52 It might exist in some form, but it would be as a shadow of itself
01:41:55 I think that the main line of the final fantasy series will die
01:41:59 It will straight up die
01:42:01 And sure the mmo might exist not it already died. I mean that's that's the thing final fantasy 15 came out
01:42:08 I guess there's no plans right now for final fantasy 16, but like people have hope foolishly. I I don't know people
01:42:16 I'll extend that to to square enix in general as a development. Things will wax and wane in video game franchises
01:42:23 People rely way too much on franchises now and continue to rely on franchises in the future
01:42:28 I think if something dies people will eventually be like, let's bring something back that died earlier
01:42:34 Let's bring back final fantasy. It's been like six years
01:42:37 I mean they're trying like oh my god. It's been such a what like gamers are just gonna keep getting older and they're never going to die
01:42:43 Look at mega men look mega men 10 and they're still gonna want to play final fantasy 7 again and feel like a 12 year old
01:42:49 But it's not gonna work. It's not gonna happen. What I'm saying is I don't like the big like I think that final fantasy 7 remake
01:42:55 People are very excited about it right now. I do not think it's going to be it's gonna be kind of like
01:43:00 um
01:43:01 Like the force awakens in that people are really excited for it
01:43:05 They see a lot of good things, but like I mean I'm not I'm not even like judging the people or anything
01:43:11 But I'm just saying like I think that they don't
01:43:14 Know what they're in for because it's just a remake of a story. Everyone already knows
01:43:20 Like I sure Sephiroth's an hd now. Is that really like this is my prediction now. So I can be wrong
01:43:27 Literally people will love it as long as it's not a complete
01:43:30 Adventuring trash fire of a video game people will love it because
01:43:34 Because people still love the star wars movies that have come out for nostalgic reasons. Okay, but that's why I say the that's why I
01:43:41 I pitted as um the force awakens because the force awakens did well
01:43:44 But what it did was it it showed what it or like now we know with the benefit of hindsight
01:43:49 We know that they did not have a plan and that like the next one like wasn't embarrassing
01:43:55 I mean in the in the internet reviewer
01:43:58 Like bubble that everybody on the internet see on youtube seems to think is the only reaction to the the star wars movies
01:44:06 It seems like the force awakens was the star wars is the last terrible
01:44:10 And will never work um like there are fans of the rise of skywalker
01:44:14 But the rise of skywalker was the worst performing one yet and that's what i'm trying to speak to this trend this downward trend
01:44:20 It's a downward trend. I think I think in 10 years it will still be limping along it will be around fair enough
01:44:26 Nearly be as hype as it used to be but it people the the the the big guys at the top
01:44:32 they they will continue to scramble for any scrap of of
01:44:37 You know, I think the remaking ability they can get I hear you and I see that but I think the remake
01:44:41 It will be more of a catastrophe than anybody expects
01:44:44 specifically because they do not have a plan beyond the first game and they they might they might succeed
01:44:50 Extremely well with this first game just like the force awakens, but I really think with well if it keeps going
01:44:56 They just have to remake the rest of the story and they will fail and they will fail in doing so in spectacular fashion because they only
01:45:02 Think about midgar. It's the only thing on their mind. They have no plan for the rest of the game
01:45:08 And it's going to people are going to not give a shit
01:45:09 I don't think I don't think that parallel
01:45:12 Is quite the same because the last jedi and rise of skywalker where they're not based on the original star wars
01:45:18 They're not remaking them. They're making a new story and the fact that the story
01:45:23 wasn't very good
01:45:24 Is separate from it being
01:45:27 You know the same property. I mean these are there are different challenges
01:45:31 But I'm just saying that there are challenges one of them being
01:45:34 There was no plan
01:45:36 I mean sure the story of final fantasy 7 exists, but like the game game development is very different from movie development
01:45:43 I guess I just don't really see why the
01:45:47 They're not having a quote-unquote plan. I don't know where you're getting the information from
01:45:50 I mean that has been explicitly stated by the developers that they have not planned what the next games are going to
01:45:56 Be about I think that really just means it's going to be a few years between
01:46:01 the parts
01:46:02 Which is I mean I would assume they're going to have to like change things up anyways because they'll be switching platforms after this one
01:46:08 Like that's true. That's true. Look you can disagree all that. That's fine. I just think it's going to fail
01:46:14 I just think your your reasoning is I don't agree with your reasoning
01:46:18 Okay, fair enough plan is is the reason like it the parallel to star wars is not quite the same
01:46:24 I think it will
01:46:25 I'm not saying it's exactly the same situation. I'm saying there's some similarities
01:46:30 I think the reason it would become less
01:46:34 Successful financially is just because
01:46:37 People will realize that a remake of final fantasy 7 is not actually that interesting and they were mostly hyped when the trailer came out
01:46:44 And that's it and that's how it's always going to be
01:46:47 The trailer is the moment where the money should be spent and I think even yeah, they might even like
01:46:54 Well, they kind of already do that don't they they do pre-orders like extremely early. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah years ahead
01:46:58 That's why they go ahead. So they take the money as fast as possible. But I mean, hey, it's coming out in a couple months
01:47:04 I think in march is when the remake episode one is coming out
01:47:07 Um, so I mean people
01:47:09 March is gonna be a packed month. I think I will be very curious to see
01:47:14 Regarding that game
01:47:15 What like everyone's really excited everyone's just like the remake the remake
01:47:19 But what they don't talk about as much is that hard cutoff. This is not a complete game
01:47:25 It is a piece of a game and how many years are you gonna have to wait for the next one? God knows
01:47:29 God only knows
01:47:30 So I kind of hope this doesn't do well just because I don't want that because like as soon as this model is proven
01:47:37 You like EA and Activision are going to immediately be like we can sell
01:47:41 A game in three parts
01:47:44 Okay, and then go back through their back catalog and they'll just all the classics
01:47:48 So like we're going to make a trilogy out of all of our classic games and it's going to be bullshit
01:47:52 Is there a game series that's done a trilogy story correctly?
01:47:55 Maybe like god of war did pretty good for its first three games
01:48:00 Max pain. I don't know. I never played it. Yeah crash bandicoot
01:48:04 Um, well, I mean how many of these like were it like mass effect was designed as like a continuing story over three games
01:48:10 God of war wasn't even designed that way. I don't think spiral was I don't think crash was they just as a story
01:48:16 I have no David jaffy created god of war was only involved. I believe right
01:48:20 And I mean a fucking mass effect was a huge catastrophe in the finale as everyone knows
01:48:25 I honestly feel like any game series that starts off thinking they're going to be a trilogy is doomed to be just subpar
01:48:33 I couldn't agree more. That's what that's what happened with fucking ratchet and clank on the ps3
01:48:38 Really?
01:48:38 They had the trilogy on ps2 and then they were like, how cool
01:48:42 Uh, ratchet and clank is a huge
01:48:44 Thing people will love the next
01:48:46 Trilogy ratchet was not intended the first game was a standalone. It wasn't intended to be a yeah
01:48:50 So that was that that was just like a natural trilogy. It was a very well-selling game
01:48:54 Three of them then ps3 comes around they make the first game
01:48:58 It has a cliffhanger ending a terrible story and I really hated it. I was completely
01:49:02 Disillusioned with ratchet and clank and I did not ever buy a single other game in the franchise after that
01:49:07 I stopped there too. I stopped there too. The second one was ironically a lot better, but uh, maybe I played that
01:49:12 I don't know. Yeah. Well, they fucked up. Yeah, let's do that. We lost a customer
01:49:16 I mean, I bought them both for five dollars in the bargain bin as I do with all the ps3 games
01:49:21 I mean, I put it on release. I'm just curious stupid
01:49:24 The the only game that ever lived up to its hype that I can remember
01:49:28 Is I mean, it wasn't a sequel, but it was like the the demo of Undertale
01:49:32 And then the actual game shocked me by actually being beyond my expectations. You know what you know what?
01:49:38 No, no
01:49:40 Did Undertale demo?
01:49:42 Let me down because the because the demo is the best part of the game in hindsight in hindsight
01:49:46 The moment with toriel is the best part of the whole game. I talked about this in great detail
01:49:50 And I agree that is the best usage of the time reversal thing
01:49:54 But like all the stuff about the multiple pathways and like being able to do a genocide and how those time
01:50:00 Rewinds they do impact things if you like do a genocide
01:50:04 Then revert it and then do a pacifist and then you get that extra little thing
01:50:08 Where it like confirms you're like still have the soul of a demon or whatever
01:50:12 Once I understood like every detail. I was like as a package
01:50:16 I'm I think that this is it has
01:50:19 greater highs or whatever
01:50:20 But like you you get your best bang for a buck if you just play the demo to its full extent. It's it's true, but um
01:50:27 I don't know whatever. Anyway, love Undertale great game. Etc. Etc. Uh
01:50:30 Fuck me can't wait the delta room to come out so that there'll be more porn of susie draw. That'll be great
01:50:36 Very exciting. That's the only reason is it coming out soon. No. No, I don't know
01:50:41 There's no there's no news at all, but like it's it's likely that he's working on it right now
01:50:46 Probably I wonder if you ever put together that team that he was talking about of uh of capable individuals
01:50:50 He's got all that sweet smash money now. So yeah, yeah, he probably had to fucking pay to get sands in there
01:50:56 Please put my skeleton son in the game. I'll do anything sakurai proceeds to filet furiously. All right. Anyway
01:51:04 skeleton son
01:51:07 All right, uh, let's go to another voicemail. We got two more. We got uh, like a little troglodyte tip diddling
01:51:14 bitch
01:51:15 Okay, damn. I love I love this guy. This sounds great. My favorite guy
01:51:20 Go last episode in response to my cry for help
01:51:23 Nate bestman asked me if I had asked anyone specifically a girl out before and the answer is fucking yeah
01:51:30 but
01:51:32 In a pretty pussy show way, you see there were two kind the first one was a couple years back a year or two
01:51:38 I think and
01:51:40 I I really I really fucking went went went zero zero powers zero masculinity in this one
01:51:46 Through a string of fucking, you know doing like this and holy gets homework
01:51:50 I managed to get her fucking medical files and found out that she liked me and I did not I would not until then
01:51:57 Ask her out, but I did
01:52:00 And the pussy is the way
01:52:02 So I fucking instagram dm to like a little little little little bit of fucking tip diddling
01:52:09 creepy bessen bitch
01:52:13 And instagram, huh?
01:52:14 Luckily enough she responded with a yes. I had a date in time as a movie. She hated the movie
01:52:20 She like fucking watched anime and like fucking listened to kpop and shit. So dodged that bullet, but you know
01:52:27 Slut I did something
01:52:29 Second time asked him about kind of
01:52:31 They were like really into furbies and like poor and shit. So that that wasn't gonna happen
01:52:36 But then they asked me to concentrate after I asked them
01:52:39 So the answer is yes kind of in a pussy way, but basically my fear is now that in this game or age
01:52:46 It'll be circulated if I do
01:52:48 So
01:52:50 Okay, uh, okay. I got it. I got it. He's got the typical fear. Yeah, so this is teen cp
01:52:56 All right, teen cp translate from zoomer for me. All right, no problem
01:52:59 He just uh, we last time he was asking about like advice or something
01:53:04 Talk girls, blah, blah, whatever and uh, I was like, have you ever talked to a girl?
01:53:08 Have you ever asked one out? It sounds like no because you don't sound very confident, etc
01:53:13 Okay, so apparently he has on a couple of occasions. Great literally twice. Good job. Uh, all right
01:53:19 So your fear about asking girls out and word getting around
01:53:23 G you just got to not worry about that because it doesn't matter. Oh my god. He asked a girl out. How embarrassed
01:53:30 I remember feeling that exact same fear. What if no, no, no, I get it, you know
01:53:35 But when I say it out loud, it sounds pretty fucking stupid, right? It does it does
01:53:40 And and when you're in that situation, do you hear that guy? He he he asked a girl out. He's like interested in romance
01:53:46 Dude, what a fucking loser dude like that guy wants to get his fucking dick wet dude. That's fucking shitty, bro
01:53:52 Cancel him. Yeah, he needs to be cancelled. Kill him Matt. Kill him now. That's a rapist in the making right there. He has a desire
01:53:59 That's disgusting
01:54:01 Um, he has that man is driven. Yeah, that's that's no good. That's no good
01:54:06 He's just a me too moment in the waiting and uh, that's no good
01:54:10 How you should drive him over? You just gotta
01:54:14 Okay, I like I don't know. I remember in my youth
01:54:16 Grappling with this very same issue and what it really came down to was just my deep insecurities
01:54:22 about like
01:54:24 Like putting any risk out there or having like anything negative happen to me
01:54:29 But these things are so
01:54:32 Inconsequential
01:54:33 Like you're a guy who's done two approaches basically and has been terrified
01:54:38 Those times and I get it. It's terrifying every time you do it. You need to up that number to like a hundred
01:54:43 Then you will stop caring and then you'll be like, yeah, it's fine. It doesn't matter. Uh, I don't know you just gotta
01:54:50 You just gotta lose your fear if you're feeling if you're feeling nervous and you need a confidence boost
01:54:55 Consider bringing a gun to school. Yeah, yeah, that'll do it
01:54:59 You've got nothing to fear then
01:55:01 Yeah, make sense to me. All right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said it. I should have said it on the show
01:55:06 real answer here is
01:55:09 There is very there basically I share this fear, but there are almost no negative consequences as a result
01:55:16 I understand biologically there's the instinct in us that like, oh no
01:55:20 We've been ejected by the females in our little 30 man tribe word will get around and I will not be able to carry on my genetic legacy
01:55:26 And my bloodline is doomed
01:55:28 But luckily, not only is it not the case that that's true
01:55:33 If if you are perceived to be more of an outgoing person who maybe even asks girls out somewhat that probably
01:55:40 Will improve your reputation as opposed to make it worse because then you're like an actual human being
01:55:45 Who it's the sort of thing
01:55:47 It's the sort of thing where like the the the other guys would say we'll try to put you down
01:55:52 Like, oh my god, this guy asked a girl out. Haha. Let's pull any guy
01:55:56 And and like all all of the boys are like, hey, yeah, fuck you loser
01:56:00 You yeah, how many girls have they asked out that day? You know, what are they doing?
01:56:03 Yeah, but like it's not that it's like the the girls in the class are like listening to this and they're like, huh
01:56:08 You know that they might be bitchy, of course
01:56:12 But there's there's some like, you know, the way boys bully is very different
01:56:16 In their in their in their hearts, these guys are thinking like wait, should I be doing that? Yes, that's true
01:56:22 Should I be doing that too? Wait, what does he know? What does he know?
01:56:26 We have to we have to question as fast as possible
01:56:28 We have to get the secrets that he got on the pcp and the procrastiners plaque
01:56:31 Is I have to give five dollars a month for those precious bonus episodes for all that secret information
01:56:36 Uh, I I would boil this down to they wish they were on they were on the voicemail
01:56:41 I'll boil this down to them. They do. I'm sure
01:56:43 Uh, uh, obviously I want to be respectful and not a creep and be reasonable and ben's point about like inviting people to do specific things
01:56:50 Is is a winning proposition. That's that's like a good a good way to do it
01:56:54 But I will say this in summary
01:56:56 People in general women men everyone everyone loves a man of action
01:57:00 So like there's nothing wrong with taking a shot
01:57:02 Just roll in the dice because you are first of all you're conditioning yourself to be more willing to do cool things
01:57:08 And also people will just respect you for doing anything
01:57:12 There you go
01:57:16 So, uh,
01:57:17 Fucking go for it, dude. Just just talk to people
01:57:20 Meet people who you think would be fun to hang out with invite them to do something casually and then do it and that's it
01:57:24 And just be a cool guy. There you go. There's your life advice

01:58:55 Really hits on a on a real point
01:58:57 That I hate like sometimes I'm I'm writing on my phone because I have an idea
01:59:01 And then I'm like deleting it because it's I'm tired and I'm like, oh
01:59:08 And then I throw my phone out the window and die
01:59:12 Well, uh, I'm happy to be uh part of the canvas upon which center can can can spew his art
01:59:18 What a wonderful what a wonderful experience. This has been uh, all right
01:59:23 That's it everybody send more poetry at the speak pipe link down below
01:59:27 Send us your epic slam poetry. Put some uh sick bongo drums in the background or something

01:59:44 All right, that's it more voicemails. You heard it send it to speak pipe
01:59:47 But more importantly you gotta head on over to patreon.com slash the procrastinators
01:59:52 Give five lowly dollars for all 33. I believe bonus episodes now
01:59:58 We just did our year in review looking forward to the future more of those kinds of thoughts on there
02:00:03 And a million other episodes of varying quality levels
02:00:07 At tpcrastinators on twitter follow us for updates and whatnot
02:00:10 And uh, if you want to play minecraft with us pcp minecraft patreon patreon.com slash psb minecraft

02:00:23 Yeah, and that's it and that's it more voicemails, etc. Etc. All right. We'll be back. Hey
02:00:28 Radcon for everybody plans are in the works
02:00:32 Keep your eyes peeled by the time the next episode comes out
02:00:35 We'll either have it out or be very close to having the Kickstarter ready. I would think and uh, we beseech you
02:00:41 We're trying just to set
02:00:42 Financial goals at reasonable levels so that we are we're not like losing money for every pledge
02:00:47 Which I think we definitely did on some of those old pledges
02:00:50 Um, and so we can just make the make the thing feasible
02:00:53 And we don't just lose money and lose time whenever doing it
02:00:56 I personally love if we could actually just get hype for lectures get high for rad content
02:01:02 If we broke even as a result of that that's fine
02:01:05 But I am in fact losing time I could spend working on my own content
02:01:09 So I would love to make a little bit of money from radcon if possible
02:01:13 Just to cover that week of expenses on my fucking rent and shit
02:01:18 Radcon case and exposure
02:01:20 Don't be a little bit. It's all it does
02:01:23 It actually does
02:01:24 You know, it's fair to say that the content that we're then able to post like the lectures does generate revenue for some time afterward
02:01:31 So that that is a that is a net positive. They're not immediate
02:01:34 I mean most importantly it justifies the existence of this podcast. You are so right. You are so right
02:01:41 So let's let's keep that going for
02:01:44 Another thousand year rike everybody. Let's hear it. Keep it going here on the episode
02:01:48 procrastiners podcast
02:01:54 All right, we'll see you next time everybody uh da da ass volt. See you then bye
