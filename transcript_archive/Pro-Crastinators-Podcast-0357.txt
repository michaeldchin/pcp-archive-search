00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Damn, we should have talked about all that incredibly interesting stuff we just talked about. We should have talked about it on the episode.
00:00:17 No, we should not have.
00:00:19 Aw, yeah, you're right. Now it gets to go on a bonus episode where people can pay money. Money!
00:00:28 Don't talk to me about money.
00:00:31 We're running out of money, Gibb.
00:00:34 It's over.
00:00:36 Yeah, it's over. Time to call it quits.
00:00:38 Time to call it quits. We are floundering. What do you have to say about that?
00:00:46 I say, fuck the police. I'll flounder, even though I'm not allowed to.
00:00:53 Yeah.
00:00:55 All right. Okay, good.
00:00:59 Welcome to the perk-er.
00:01:03 We've got to go all in on the perfect comic party. It's the only way.
00:01:10 The people don't want podcasts anymore.
00:01:13 They've grown beyond podcasts. I don't care about all that podcast stuff.
00:01:19 I'm sad this month.
00:01:22 Go on.
00:01:23 I'm sad and depressed, Sven.
00:01:25 Go on.
00:01:26 I've been feeling real bad.
00:01:29 Yeah, cool.
00:01:31 Oh, it's so cool. You want to hear about it? You want me to talk about it at length?
00:01:35 That's going to be great content.
00:01:37 No.
00:01:40 I mean, I would love to hear about it if you'd like to discuss.
00:01:46 Well, all right. The annoying part is that it's a feeling that's hard to explain.
00:01:56 How long have you been feeling this way, Gim?
00:01:59 Just this week?
00:02:01 Last few weeks. I don't really know.
00:02:05 Okay.
00:02:07 First off, some basic notes. Lack of confidence that anything will work out with anything that I'm doing.
00:02:18 Increasing pressure to get some shit together so that the bad things will not happen even though I know they will.
00:02:27 Yeah.
00:02:29 And a horrific feeling of nobody understanding me and never being able to express how I feel ever.
00:02:41 That's how I've been going.
00:02:44 You know, well, no, you know, I don't want to make it about me.
00:02:49 But okay, I mean, I understand all those.
00:02:54 Those all make sense.
00:02:57 I put something somewhere.
00:03:00 I put a little, yeah, I wrote it down.
00:03:03 Yeah, I was feeling sad about transience.
00:03:07 Transience?
00:03:09 Transience, the things being brief or fleeting.
00:03:15 I'm sorry. You were feeling sad about the concept of transience in general?
00:03:21 Well, yeah, I mean, everything's got to stop at some point.
00:03:28 Yeah. You know, I mean, I agree with you and I do get sad about it sometimes.
00:03:32 It's just funny to hear you express it so casually.
00:03:36 Oh, yeah, I'm just sad about transience.
00:03:38 Just sad about transience.
00:03:39 Well, that's the word.
00:03:41 But I agree though, but sure, it is sad, yes.
00:03:44 Yeah, I mean, it's most of my frustration is that I don't know how to explain how I feel.
00:03:55 And every time I try to come up with a series of words or like a thing to say,
00:04:00 oh, so what's wrong?
00:04:01 Oh, well.
00:04:03 And then it's like white noise.
00:04:04 Like how do I express white noise in my head?
00:04:07 Like words and language just don't cut it.
00:04:12 You have to feel it.
00:04:13 But it's also really stupid and pointless to talk like that in front of people with language
00:04:19 who can only understand words.
00:04:23 So I'm just sort of like, oh, it's just like that book.
00:04:29 I have no 1984 and I must 1985 or whatever.
00:04:37 Yes, it's not like that book at all.
00:04:39 That's why he wrote that book.
00:04:41 I don't feel like I'm cursed by a robot or whatever.
00:04:47 I'm cursed by the algorithm.
00:04:51 So I mean, okay, what's got you feeling this way?
00:05:02 I think it's just I don't feel like I'm capable of making it in a basic sense.
00:05:12 Like I can draw a little comic and it just takes a really long time.
00:05:18 And you're always going to compare yourself to other people and you should try not to.
00:05:23 It's like just don't worry about it.
00:05:25 Don't worry about not being able to make a living.
00:05:27 Just try your best and keep going.
00:05:30 The best work comes when you're not stressing out.
00:05:33 I'm like, okay, so don't worry about anything.
00:05:37 How do you do that?
00:05:39 I mean, it's impossible.
00:05:46 It's just there's no escape and I don't think I'm cut out for life.
00:05:54 I don't know what I'm doing here.
00:06:00 It's pretty heavy.
00:06:02 I understand.
00:06:03 Yeah, it is all encompassing.
00:06:04 I mean, I get you.
00:06:06 What are you going to do about it?
00:06:08 Well, it's two things.
00:06:09 I want to kill myself too.
00:06:11 Don't do that and persist.
00:06:14 I like persisting.
00:06:15 I'm pretty good at that.
00:06:16 I've been practicing my whole life.
00:06:18 Yeah.
00:06:21 I mean, it's not like on the table or anything,
00:06:28 but it is one of those like...
00:06:30 We're killing yourself?
00:06:31 Yeah.
00:06:32 Okay, good.
00:06:33 It's good.
00:06:34 No, it's not on the table.
00:06:35 I don't want to worry anyone, but it's just,
00:06:41 I don't feel like I can make it.
00:06:43 I don't feel like I can do it.
00:06:45 No matter what it is.
00:06:47 It's just sort of like, yeah.
00:06:53 Are you talking about career-wise, comics-wise?
00:06:59 Comics-wise, career-wise.
00:07:05 I don't know, just life stuff.
00:07:07 Like transitioning.
00:07:12 I don't know.
00:07:15 I'm getting choked up.
00:07:17 Getting all choked up about it.
00:07:19 Oh dear.
00:07:20 I shouldn't have brought it up, but...
00:07:21 Well, that's not good content.
00:07:23 No.
00:07:24 We're hemorrhaging viewers right now.
00:07:25 Crying live?
00:07:26 No.
00:07:27 They'll think I'm going for the pity vote.
00:07:28 They'll think I'm crying for views.
00:07:30 Got to keep those tears locked away.
00:07:33 Ben's secretly...
00:07:35 Wait, no.
00:07:36 Actually, I know tears are good for views.
00:07:38 I got to make him cry more, but how?
00:07:43 I'm going to steal Christmas.
00:07:44 I'm going to steal Christmas gift.
00:07:46 I'm going to come down from Mount Crumpet
00:07:48 and steal all your buzz-wonglers.
00:07:51 Christmas.
00:07:53 Bah-hum-bog.
00:07:57 You know what?
00:07:59 I've watched today.
00:08:02 My brother was here.
00:08:03 This is why the PCP is late here,
00:08:05 because my brother was visiting,
00:08:07 and I just want to hang out with him.
00:08:10 And we watched a movie
00:08:15 called The Christmas Game.
00:08:18 The Christmas Game?
00:08:20 It was like a two-hour-long movie,
00:08:22 and we realized that halfway through,
00:08:24 it was a two-hour-long epic fantasy folklore tale
00:08:30 of one of the Knights of the Round Table
00:08:33 and King Arthur,
00:08:35 and it's some sort of adaptation of a historical novel
00:08:39 by an anonymous writer.
00:08:41 Why would you watch The Christmas Game
00:08:43 when it's April?
00:08:45 I don't know.
00:08:46 Henry put it on.
00:08:47 That's so funny.
00:08:48 When I googled The Christmas Game,
00:08:49 the first thing I find is a board game.
00:08:51 Wait, it wasn't called The Christmas Game.
00:08:53 It was called The Green Night, I think.
00:08:56 Wait, how did you call it?
00:08:58 Wait, wait.
00:09:00 Yeah, I've heard of The Green Night.
00:09:02 Why'd you call it The Christmas Game?
00:09:04 Because in The Green Night,
00:09:05 there is a game called The Christmas Game.
00:09:08 It's Christmas Day during the beginning,
00:09:11 and this Green Night, this big,
00:09:13 made-of-wood sort of guy,
00:09:15 marches in to the throne room of King Arthur's court,
00:09:19 and he says,
00:09:21 fight me, buddy.
00:09:23 This is a Christmas game.
00:09:24 Choose one of your knights,
00:09:26 and there's this clothes,
00:09:29 not Santa clothes,
00:09:31 in this little contract of this game.
00:09:33 We're like, fight me,
00:09:36 whatever damage you do to me.
00:09:38 The person, they have to try and nick me.
00:09:40 They have to try and cut me and hurt me.
00:09:42 And whatever damage you do,
00:09:44 six months from now,
00:09:46 or no, a year from now,
00:09:48 six nights to the north,
00:09:50 I will be waiting in a chapel,
00:09:52 and you must come to receive the same mark again.
00:09:58 And so this kid, like a...
00:10:01 So why would you want to hurt him
00:10:03 if he says you'll be hurt as well?
00:10:05 I know. It was so stupid,
00:10:07 because he's like this young boy,
00:10:09 he's always fucking,
00:10:11 but he doesn't have any cool epic tales.
00:10:13 He's in the brothel,
00:10:15 and he doesn't have any stories to tell the court,
00:10:17 or King Arthur or King Arthur's like,
00:10:19 come on, boy, got any cool stories?
00:10:21 And he's like, uh, no.
00:10:23 All I do is fuck.
00:10:25 And it's so like,
00:10:27 I want to go on an epic quest, I guess.
00:10:29 I guess that'll be good to do that.
00:10:31 Um...
00:10:33 And then...
00:10:35 And, uh...
00:10:37 Yeah, so he has an opportunity
00:10:39 to go on an epic quest,
00:10:41 or to do something cool.
00:10:43 He says, I'll fight the Green Knight.
00:10:45 But he, like, idiot, like real stupid,
00:10:47 he chops the Knight's head off,
00:10:49 he beheads him, because the Green Knight
00:10:51 just kneels back down and says,
00:10:53 hey, why don't you chop off my head?
00:10:55 He presents his neck.
00:10:57 That's a great idea.
00:10:59 Didn't you listen to the thing you'll have to get
00:11:01 your head chopped off? Just nick his arm.
00:11:03 Just give him a little cut on the knee.
00:11:05 Like, what are you doing? And he killed him.
00:11:07 But he took his head up, and he's like,
00:11:09 haha, I'm the headless horseman now.
00:11:11 And he laughed, and he ran away.
00:11:13 And so, like, a year later,
00:11:15 that he just...
00:11:17 He just like, oh,
00:11:19 I guess I gotta go.
00:11:21 Oh, I guess I gotta go, and then he goes.
00:11:23 And he just has, like, little escapades,
00:11:25 little moments
00:11:27 in between, like, on his adventure.
00:11:29 Yeah.
00:11:31 Thinking that, you know, he'll have courage
00:11:33 by the end, or he'll be a Knight
00:11:35 worthy of King Arthur.
00:11:37 And he just sort of... Because I chopped
00:11:39 the head off a guy who let me do it?
00:11:41 Yeah, and, well, no,
00:11:43 now he has to go and get his head chopped off,
00:11:45 and he knows that. And I'm like,
00:11:47 why did you chop his head off then?
00:11:49 That's the part I don't get. Why would you do this?
00:11:51 The clause didn't say kill me.
00:11:53 It says, like, nick me.
00:11:55 Literally, that's what he says.
00:11:57 Yeah.
00:11:59 Anyway, he goes there.
00:12:01 And the film, it looks beautiful.
00:12:03 Acting is all right.
00:12:05 But it's, like,
00:12:07 so overly slow.
00:12:09 It does not need to be
00:12:11 two hours long, and we're getting bored.
00:12:13 Mm-hmm.
00:12:15 It's obviously very thematically rich,
00:12:17 and all the characters and the things are, like,
00:12:19 there's lots to delve into,
00:12:21 but we were just not going to be bothered with that shit.
00:12:23 We skipped ahead.
00:12:25 I remember that movie came out,
00:12:27 and for some reason, I thought it was, like, an MCU.
00:12:29 I thought the Green Knight was, like,
00:12:31 a, you know...
00:12:33 The Green Lantern?
00:12:35 Some little-known Marvel hero.
00:12:37 They're like, oh, they're making another...
00:12:39 They've delved into the depths of...
00:12:41 Oh, they got Moon Knight, and who the fuck is that?
00:12:43 Oh, they got the Green Knight.
00:12:45 Okay, sure. That's what I thought.
00:12:47 But no, I guess it was, like, a real movie.
00:12:49 Yeah, it's a real movie.
00:12:51 Critics love it, apparently, but...
00:12:53 Mm-hmm.
00:12:55 I didn't have the patience.
00:12:57 It was just, like, every scene,
00:12:59 there would be scenes of him walking,
00:13:01 and those scenes of walking would just go on
00:13:03 for, like, 20 seconds longer than they really needed to,
00:13:05 and he goes on a lot of walking scenes,
00:13:07 in between scenes where he's looking,
00:13:09 and then sometimes he's looking,
00:13:11 and then he's scared,
00:13:13 and it's like, shut up!
00:13:15 Shut up!
00:13:17 Just get to the part where you go to the Green Knight
00:13:19 and get your head chopped off.
00:13:21 Oh, he gets his axe.
00:13:23 Oh, he gets his Green Axe
00:13:25 for landing the blow.
00:13:27 I'll give you... Yeah, you land the blow,
00:13:29 I'll give you the Green Axe, and it's a cool-looking axe.
00:13:31 Like, it makes moss and grass
00:13:33 appear around it just very slowly.
00:13:35 Okay.
00:13:37 Like, he puts the axe away in a treasure chest
00:13:39 for later, because he doesn't want to use it.
00:13:41 He doesn't care about it.
00:13:43 And then when he goes to get his head chopped off,
00:13:45 the axe has grown, like,
00:13:47 moss inside the wooden crate.
00:13:49 It's just...
00:13:51 There's moss everywhere.
00:13:53 But I don't think he even uses the fucking axe.
00:13:55 It's just sort of...
00:13:57 He has it.
00:13:59 We did skip around, so maybe we did use it.
00:14:01 I mean, it's pretty cool to have.
00:14:03 Cool to have, even if you don't use it.
00:14:05 I got a magic axe.
00:14:07 Yeah.
00:14:09 All right.
00:14:11 He meets a fox, and the fox is like,
00:14:13 ah, hi, hi, my little fox.
00:14:15 I'll teach you something about yourself.
00:14:17 And he's like, fuck off.
00:14:19 Yeah.
00:14:21 That's what I would probably say.
00:14:25 I'll teach you something about yourself.
00:14:27 Ooh.
00:14:29 You want to learn about friendship?
00:14:31 Fuck off.
00:14:33 Dog.
00:14:35 Yeah.
00:14:37 So, this is not a review, because we did skip,
00:14:39 like, basically from the midway point
00:14:41 to the end.
00:14:43 And then we saw the moment
00:14:45 where he puts the thing and he's like,
00:14:47 all right,
00:14:49 you can cut my head off now.
00:14:51 Wait, I'm not ready.
00:14:53 When will you be ready?
00:14:55 Give me a moment.
00:14:57 Are you ready? Yeah.
00:14:59 Why did he go?
00:15:01 I don't know.
00:15:03 Some sort of parable, probably.
00:15:05 Some sort of story.
00:15:07 To be a great man
00:15:09 is
00:15:11 to get your head chopped off
00:15:13 to get your head chopped off in this epic way.
00:15:15 I mean,
00:15:17 yeah.
00:15:19 It's kind of ambiguous at the very end
00:15:21 whether or not it happens, because like,
00:15:23 he runs away, right?
00:15:25 He runs away and he comes back home
00:15:27 and it's supposedly like a happy moment.
00:15:29 But then
00:15:31 things happen.
00:15:33 A king author dies, he becomes the king,
00:15:35 because he's related by like
00:15:37 sister or something.
00:15:39 I don't know.
00:15:41 Some sort of reason.
00:15:43 And he becomes the king
00:15:45 and then his kingdom crumbles
00:15:47 because of war and he's just kind of a shit king
00:15:49 and he has a
00:15:51 bastard boy son
00:15:53 and the son dies in war
00:15:55 and it's like, oh, all this shit,
00:15:57 this bad stuff happens.
00:15:59 You should have got your head chopped off,
00:16:01 then all that bad stuff wouldn't have happened.
00:16:03 And that was a flash forward.
00:16:05 Premonition did.
00:16:07 And he was back there
00:16:09 and he was like, oh, wait.
00:16:11 I am ready.
00:16:13 I won't run away
00:16:15 like a coward and live.
00:16:17 I will instead die
00:16:19 from a green guy
00:16:21 and the green guy says, well done son.
00:16:23 Well done.
00:16:25 Now off with your head
00:16:27 and then credits.
00:16:29 I see.
00:16:31 And I'm like, I think it's supposed to be
00:16:33 ambiguous. He could say off with your head
00:16:35 as an off with you.
00:16:37 Head of state.
00:16:39 Maybe.
00:16:41 But they don't
00:16:43 show any death after that.
00:16:45 So I guess the idea is
00:16:47 the moral of the story is
00:16:49 do things you
00:16:51 promise you're going to do, like
00:16:53 get your head chopped off.
00:16:55 Even though it's scary.
00:16:57 Your land will be cursed.
00:16:59 Otherwise you'll be a shit king
00:17:01 and nobody wants that.
00:17:03 You'll have like a green aura around your kingdom.
00:17:05 The lighting will be kind of green, meaning bad.
00:17:07 Ooh, green is bad.
00:17:09 Yeah, green is bad.
00:17:11 I learned that from The Matrix.
00:17:13 I learned that from Slytherin.
00:17:15 Oh yeah.
00:17:17 Funny how green is bad, even though green is
00:17:19 gross and cows eat that
00:17:21 and cows are nice.
00:17:23 I made a tweet like that a long time ago.
00:17:25 We should have known Rowling was bad
00:17:27 because she made the bad guys
00:17:29 green and the good guys red.
00:17:31 And that's wrong.
00:17:33 She's twisted.
00:17:35 She's twisted in the mind.
00:17:37 She shoots the...
00:17:39 They shoot the...
00:17:41 I got it messed up. People criticized me in the replies
00:17:43 and I had to figure it out.
00:17:45 I thought that it was...
00:17:47 Expelliarmus was red
00:17:49 and the killing curse, Avada Kedavra,
00:17:51 was green. I was kind of wrong.
00:17:53 I was half wrong.
00:17:55 Okay.
00:17:57 Yes.
00:17:59 It is red though.
00:18:01 Okay.
00:18:03 I think it depends on what you're looking at.
00:18:05 In the movie, maybe,
00:18:07 but in the book,
00:18:09 I think it's usually not described
00:18:11 with any particular visual flair.
00:18:13 There's like one part where
00:18:15 it says there's a red flash
00:18:17 that Expelliarmus could...
00:18:19 One part or no, a scarlet flash.
00:18:21 But what I was thinking of
00:18:23 was the stunning curse.
00:18:25 Oh, it's the other one.
00:18:27 Stupendo?
00:18:29 Stupify.
00:18:31 Stupify shoots the red beam.
00:18:33 Stupify versus...
00:18:35 I think they remember that.
00:18:37 The Ministry of Magic guys do that all the time
00:18:39 after a certain point.
00:18:41 They just jump in and that's their taser.
00:18:43 Yeah, that's their laser
00:18:45 that stops you but doesn't kill you.
00:18:47 The bad guys use the laser that kills you
00:18:49 and it's green.
00:18:51 In the games, Expelliarmus
00:18:53 has no
00:18:55 defined
00:18:57 visual
00:18:59 flair look.
00:19:01 Sometimes it's like a parry button.
00:19:03 Expelliarmus is like in the third game.
00:19:05 It's like a parry that you have to time.
00:19:09 Snape uses it one time
00:19:11 in the book when it's described
00:19:13 as causing a scarlet flash.
00:19:15 There is...
00:19:17 Oh god, no, what was I going to say?
00:19:19 Oh no, it's over.
00:19:21 Harry Potter.
00:19:23 Harry Potter.
00:19:25 What a film.
00:19:27 What a book.
00:19:29 What a game.
00:19:31 What a tale, yeah.
00:19:33 So basically the Green Knight
00:19:35 is a long, long film that's okay.
00:19:37 RRR is very long.
00:19:39 RRR is three hours
00:19:41 but it's awesome.
00:19:43 We also social in the sheep.
00:19:45 A couple of people
00:19:47 watched RRR after the last episode
00:19:49 and from what I said, they saw it was good
00:19:51 so I thought I was pretty happy about that.
00:19:53 We also saw
00:19:55 Sean The Sheep, the movie.
00:19:57 That's an Aardman, right?
00:19:59 Yeah.
00:20:01 Yeah, I've not seen that one.
00:20:03 It's a very funny,
00:20:05 family-friendly...
00:20:07 I mean, they're all family-friendly
00:20:09 but Sean The Sheep, the TV show, is like
00:20:11 for kids.
00:20:13 It's a little simple
00:20:15 but it's nice, it's fun.
00:20:17 So I was surprised.
00:20:19 My mom did not like
00:20:21 freaking, was it called
00:20:23 flushed away?
00:20:25 She thought it was a rat one?
00:20:27 Yeah, she thought it was like too gross.
00:20:29 There is poop.
00:20:31 There's not even poop.
00:20:33 There's toilets and there's slime,
00:20:35 like snails and stuff in the sewers.
00:20:37 That's probably as gross
00:20:39 as it gets, I think.
00:20:41 I know and I just don't think it's that...
00:20:43 It's that gross.
00:20:45 It's actually as gross as the opening of Shrek.
00:20:47 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:20:49 Yeah.
00:20:51 I don't know.
00:20:53 I just didn't get that.
00:20:55 But I thought flushed away
00:20:57 was really good.
00:20:59 Yeah, flushed away, I remember enjoying that.
00:21:01 I haven't watched that in a long time.
00:21:03 I think I watched it like two or three years ago.
00:21:07 What was I going to say?
00:21:09 You know Sean The Titular Sheep?
00:21:11 Yeah, I mean
00:21:13 not really, but
00:21:15 I guess
00:21:17 I can assume some things about him.
00:21:19 Well, what can you assume?
00:21:21 I don't know that he's a sheep.
00:21:23 Oh, okay.
00:21:25 Well, have you seen the other Willis and Gromit movies?
00:21:27 Yeah, well, several of them.
00:21:29 Have you seen A Close Shave?
00:21:33 That's the one with the dog that's a robot
00:21:35 and all the sheep and including Sean.
00:21:39 The dog?
00:21:41 Wait, I'm thinking of
00:21:43 the dog that's a robot.
00:21:45 I'm thinking of the wrong trousers.
00:21:47 The wrong trousers is the one where the trousers
00:21:49 are incorrect and there's a penguin
00:21:51 and there's a penguin in a diamond
00:21:53 house and
00:21:55 that's the penguin one.
00:21:57 The Close Shave is the one where
00:21:59 Willis falls in love with
00:22:01 a lady at the wool, the knitting store.
00:22:03 She's got all this wool
00:22:05 and
00:22:07 there's this dog
00:22:09 that
00:22:11 provides her with the wool but it's kind of
00:22:13 a really weird bully dog,
00:22:15 nasty dog, Gromit hates him
00:22:17 and Gromit realizes that the dog's
00:22:19 evil but nobody believes him
00:22:21 because the lady believes
00:22:23 the dog and Willis believes the lady
00:22:25 and so Gromit
00:22:27 is
00:22:29 something happens
00:22:31 but there's sheep, right?
00:22:33 And it's actually the dog
00:22:35 is evil.
00:22:37 Evil dog. He's a robot
00:22:39 scary dog, scary robot
00:22:41 dog made of robots.
00:22:43 Yes.
00:22:45 It's made of robots?
00:22:47 I think the thing was
00:22:49 her dad was
00:22:51 an inventor and he
00:22:53 invented the dog to look after her
00:22:55 but it sort of goes too far
00:22:57 I think.
00:22:59 I thought I'd seen all the
00:23:01 Wallace and Gromits but maybe I didn't see that one
00:23:03 because that doesn't sound familiar at all.
00:23:05 That is probably
00:23:07 that is one of my favorites
00:23:09 I would say
00:23:11 I've seen the wrong trousers
00:23:13 and I've seen the first one where they go to the moon.
00:23:15 The grand day out.
00:23:17 I thought I'd seen the third one too but
00:23:19 what you're describing
00:23:21 I have no recollection of a
00:23:23 of a dog made of robots.
00:23:25 I mean it's a reveal at the end
00:23:27 but like
00:23:29 I guess this is what he looks like.
00:23:31 Let me
00:23:33 This is where his skin has been torn off in the contraption
00:23:35 and you can see his robotness
00:23:37 I put a gif
00:23:39 Wait a minute
00:23:41 Yes
00:23:43 Yes I have seen
00:23:45 this creature
00:23:47 It's nightmare fuel
00:23:49 I was so small when I saw this one
00:23:51 It's the scariest movie I've ever seen
00:23:55 I agree
00:23:57 And Gromit there's
00:23:59 an amazing like night chase
00:24:01 on the motorway where
00:24:03 Gromit tries to save the sheep
00:24:05 on a motorbike
00:24:07 and Gromit tries to save all the sheep
00:24:09 and then there's another thing where like
00:24:11 Gromit gets a little
00:24:13 Oh it's so fucking cool
00:24:15 He gets a little aeroplane
00:24:17 with a porridge gun on the front
00:24:19 Oh the porridge gun
00:24:21 Yeah
00:24:23 I do definitely remember that
00:24:25 Well it's so Gromit
00:24:27 it's so fucking good
00:24:29 in any other franchise
00:24:31 It's better than the Avengers
00:24:33 Oh yeah
00:24:35 Iron Man couldn't do fucking shit about it
00:24:37 against Wallace
00:24:39 My dad
00:24:41 really liked
00:24:43 My dad really liked Wallace and Gromit
00:24:45 and I
00:24:47 as a kid I accidentally recorded
00:24:49 Pokemon over our copy
00:24:51 of the wrong trousers
00:24:53 My dad was really pissed at me
00:24:55 Why do I have that same memory?
00:24:57 Why do I have that exact memory
00:24:59 of the wrong trousers being taped over
00:25:01 and so we couldn't watch the beginning of it
00:25:05 I guess it's just one of those things
00:25:07 Just one of those things
00:25:09 Everyone has to deal with it
00:25:11 Every father has to deal with their child
00:25:13 taping over their copy
00:25:15 of the wrong trousers
00:25:23 Well that's it for this week
00:25:25 See you later
00:25:27 What do I got in my notes
00:25:29 What do I got in my notes for the week
00:25:31 Oh me and
00:25:33 I bought some more government bonds
00:25:35 I
00:25:37 I indulged in fiscal responsibility
00:25:39 and I purchased more eye bonds
00:25:41 and me and
00:25:43 Asterios
00:25:45 was like super stoked
00:25:47 to see me talking about eye bonds
00:25:49 on the Twitter timeline
00:25:51 He was like aww eye bonds
00:25:53 so much I called my mom about them
00:25:55 It's like cool man
00:26:01 Gotta have a hobby huh
00:26:03 Fiscal responsibility
00:26:05 I prefer video games
00:26:07 You know it's actually a pretty good hobby
00:26:09 You know it's actually a pretty good hobby
00:26:11 because then you have money afterwards
00:26:13 after you get all done with it
00:26:17 I know you said don't talk to me about money
00:26:19 but guess what idiot I'm gonna
00:26:21 Did I think I've probably explained what eye bonds do before
00:26:23 but maybe
00:26:25 They you
00:26:27 you connect
00:26:29 a robot that deals
00:26:31 in currency to your eye
00:26:33 and then you can see the money
00:26:35 You can see the money
00:26:37 I could see this computer
00:26:39 I could sell that for $50
00:26:41 This bottle of water I could sell that for $0.50
00:26:43 I could take it all
00:26:45 I could zap it with my old VR gun
00:26:47 turn it into currency
00:26:49 An eye bond is a government bond
00:26:51 whose inflation
00:26:53 not inflation rate
00:26:55 What's the thing for when you put
00:26:57 your money in something
00:26:59 Interest rate is fixed to inflation
00:27:01 So last year
00:27:03 You know thanks to
00:27:05 Biden, thanks to Brandon
00:27:07 You know inflation was really high
00:27:09 So the eye bond return rate
00:27:11 was an unbelievable 9%
00:27:13 So
00:27:15 A 9% return on an investment
00:27:17 is like
00:27:19 You never get that, that doesn't even happen
00:27:21 But this was on a government bond
00:27:23 which is like one of the safest
00:27:25 and most stable
00:27:27 investments that a person can make
00:27:29 So it was like a no brainer
00:27:31 So I dumped as much money as I could
00:27:33 into eye bonds
00:27:35 And for six months I was getting that sweet sweet
00:27:37 9% return
00:27:39 It's you know and then
00:27:41 just the other day
00:27:43 at the end of April it was going to be
00:27:45 like a new period or whatever
00:27:47 So at this point
00:27:49 the interest rate is not 9% anymore
00:27:51 Now it's like almost 7%
00:27:53 Which is still pretty good
00:27:55 That's still pretty good
00:27:57 So I dumped some more money in there
00:27:59 to get that 7%
00:28:01 And then if it keeps going down
00:28:03 I probably won't continue to do eye bonds
00:28:05 But like for the time being
00:28:07 I'm putting as much money into eye bonds as I can
00:28:09 And just letting it
00:28:11 get as much interest as I can get out of it
00:28:13 Cause it's just you know
00:28:15 9% Gib
00:28:17 9%
00:28:19 It's very good
00:28:21 Considered from another perspective
00:28:23 It's not so much good
00:28:25 It's not so much like oh hell yeah
00:28:27 I'm gaining 9%
00:28:29 It's like if I don't put money in there
00:28:31 I'm losing 9%
00:28:33 Because inflation is devastating 9%
00:28:35 of the money that I do have
00:28:37 So you know
00:28:39 Either way you gotta do it
00:28:41 Conceived of the one way
00:28:43 It's like I got something
00:28:45 Conceived of another way
00:28:47 It's like I protected
00:28:49 a portion of my assets
00:28:51 from an inevitable devastation
00:28:53 So you know
00:28:55 Tomato, tomato
00:28:59 It's not that I feel bad about you doing it
00:29:01 It's a feel I feel bad about me
00:29:03 not being good enough
00:29:05 to do
00:29:07 organizing
00:29:09 Fiscal responsibility
00:29:11 It's never a bad time for fiscal responsibility Gib
00:29:13 It's never a bad time
00:29:15 Never a bad time
00:29:17 Just feel so pathetic
00:29:25 Here's the thing
00:29:27 Maybe I'm just a wacky weirdo
00:29:29 or something
00:29:31 I have gotten to the point
00:29:33 where I find discovering
00:29:35 money loopholes like fun
00:29:37 I like
00:29:39 I don't know I find it like a gratifying thing
00:29:41 to like
00:29:43 look into and learn about
00:29:45 Like I watch
00:29:47 I watch the YouTuber called Patrick Boyle
00:29:49 who is like an accountant or something
00:29:51 I watch Patrick Boyle
00:29:53 and learn about like the latest crypto
00:29:55 scams or whatever
00:29:57 and um
00:29:59 You know I was watching one of his videos
00:30:01 recently
00:30:03 and uh
00:30:05 it did occur to me
00:30:07 It did occur to me
00:30:09 that like really from any
00:30:11 from any rational
00:30:13 um
00:30:15 person's point of view any rational like
00:30:17 financial investor
00:30:19 like all this stuff that I do oh and putting my money
00:30:21 in I-bonds uh churning my credit cards
00:30:23 uh you know
00:30:25 using cash back programs and stuff
00:30:27 all of that is like
00:30:29 at the end of the day it's very marginal
00:30:31 that's me like doing scraping
00:30:33 whatever strategies I can together
00:30:35 to mitigate the effects
00:30:37 of you know like the true
00:30:39 the true horror
00:30:41 the true devastation that I face
00:30:43 which is that I just don't have just like
00:30:45 a real job
00:30:47 like a regular
00:30:49 person just has a regular job and a salary
00:30:51 and like
00:30:53 it's that's just like a million times more reasonable
00:30:55 than everything everything else
00:30:57 that I'm doing so everything else that I do
00:30:59 is just to try and mitigate the effects
00:31:01 of me not doing that
00:31:03 uh and I can pat myself
00:31:05 on the back for getting two percent cash back
00:31:07 or whatever all I want but um
00:31:09 you know
00:31:11 uh
00:31:13 yeah I mean
00:31:15 but like
00:31:17 it's it's good to do if you're in a
00:31:19 situation it is it's good it would be
00:31:21 it would be good to do it would be good to do no matter
00:31:23 what I mean if I if I was making
00:31:25 real money then
00:31:27 getting two percent cash back on all my spending
00:31:29 would be even better it would be an even
00:31:31 better thing to do
00:31:33 um so it's good
00:31:35 but yeah I was I was
00:31:37 listening to him it was listening to Patrick Boyle
00:31:39 and he did a one about he was talking
00:31:41 about the video was about
00:31:43 investment strategies
00:31:45 like
00:31:47 academic people
00:31:49 that recommend versus what like popular
00:31:51 like authors and like
00:31:53 influencers recommend
00:31:55 and how they don't always recommend the same things
00:31:57 and just yeah the emphasis
00:31:59 on the emphasis on like
00:32:01 planning for retirement and on like trying
00:32:03 to like hit a certain like savings
00:32:05 goal by a certain point in retirement
00:32:07 it's like wow
00:32:09 I haven't planned for that at all
00:32:11 I'm literally just
00:32:13 happy to I'm I'm I'm just
00:32:15 happy to have paid my
00:32:17 rent and not have less money
00:32:19 at the end of the year than I did
00:32:21 the year before that's success
00:32:23 to me and that's and
00:32:25 that's bad
00:32:27 that's not good
00:32:29 but
00:32:31 anything else just seems
00:32:33 so hard
00:32:35 like I would have to completely
00:32:37 upend my life
00:32:39 to do anything else
00:32:41 yeah
00:32:43 when I get old I'm just gonna hurl myself
00:32:45 off a cliff
00:32:47 I'm gonna make sure I'm live streaming it
00:32:51 that's my life insurance you've never seen
00:32:53 content like this before
00:32:55 just want to bounce sound
00:32:57 oh no
00:32:59 you know what Gib
00:33:01 I'll tell you this if it makes you feel any
00:33:03 better I wouldn't watch it
00:33:05 I wouldn't watch it I turn my eyes away
00:33:07 and say no I can't look
00:33:09 okay
00:33:13 yeah I don't know like things like
00:33:15 owning property
00:33:17 having a pension in any
00:33:19 fashion oh god a pension
00:33:21 doing like
00:33:23 well being
00:33:25 any amount of success
00:33:27 having
00:33:29 money at all
00:33:31 just doesn't make any sense
00:33:33 doesn't even register as a thing
00:33:35 until I'm reminded about
00:33:37 how I'm not doing it I'm like oh yeah
00:33:39 I understand
00:33:43 I don't know I guess it has become
00:33:45 sort of a hobby for me
00:33:47 looking into how to
00:33:49 how to how to
00:33:51 what's the word
00:33:53 how to squeeze as much
00:33:55 value as I possibly can
00:33:57 out of what money I do have
00:33:59 um
00:34:01 actually a stereos
00:34:03 okay a long time ago
00:34:05 we had um
00:34:11 cheesy just made a funny comic
00:34:13 I'm going to like it
00:34:15 I'm gonna hit like on that tweet
00:34:17 um a stereos
00:34:19 recommended to me
00:34:21 he recommended to me a couple of like bank
00:34:23 things he recommended me a couple of counts
00:34:25 that I could keep my money in
00:34:27 and that would earn like 4%
00:34:29 or like 4.25%
00:34:31 and I was like blown away by that
00:34:33 I was like how can it be
00:34:35 how can that be that high
00:34:37 because when we had um Minerva
00:34:39 Minerva double cast remember
00:34:41 is that her name is that her real name
00:34:43 or does she have a different name now
00:34:45 I remember double cast
00:34:47 we had double cast on because she I guess
00:34:49 is like a CPA or something and she was recommending
00:34:51 I think I asked her
00:34:53 about like what I should invest in and she recommended
00:34:55 like a market linked
00:34:57 fuck
00:34:59 was it like a market linked mutual fund
00:35:01 or something like that
00:35:03 and um I never really looked into that
00:35:05 because I'm stupid
00:35:07 a stereos said he had a couple of like
00:35:09 banks that offer like
00:35:11 4% and like that's crazy
00:35:13 because my bank
00:35:15 of America savings account which I've kept
00:35:17 my money in for my entire life
00:35:19 offers like 0.01%
00:35:21 interest
00:35:23 so nothing
00:35:25 um if I'd been man if I'd been
00:35:27 earning 4% I would have
00:35:31 that would that would be significant
00:35:33 that's a considerable
00:35:35 amount of money that I have basically
00:35:37 thrown down the drain
00:35:39 by using
00:35:41 a bank of America savings account like a fucking moron
00:35:43 so
00:35:45 you know the way I see it
00:35:47 the way I see it right
00:35:49 it's like
00:35:51 you
00:35:53 I can bemoan
00:35:55 that like oh I should have done that and then
00:35:57 I would have more money now like yeah true
00:35:59 yeah true but it's more
00:36:01 productive and a little bit more
00:36:03 what's the word
00:36:05 encouraging to look at it like
00:36:07 you're in a boat
00:36:09 and you're and the money
00:36:11 that you have
00:36:13 is the wait you're you're either
00:36:15 sinking or you're floating
00:36:17 and so if you manage to like if you manage to patch
00:36:19 a hole you know if you're
00:36:21 sinking now that's bad but if you patch
00:36:23 a hole you shouldn't you shouldn't bemoan the water
00:36:25 that's that's come in already
00:36:27 you patch a hole and you stop the leak
00:36:29 or whatever it's like no no no don't
00:36:31 don't get upset about the water that leaked in already
00:36:33 just feel good that you patch the hole you're doing better
00:36:35 now you're on it you're on it you've improved
00:36:37 your trajectory
00:36:39 um that's what I like to do I feel
00:36:41 like oh I can get I can get two percent
00:36:43 cash back instead of one point five bam
00:36:45 I've improved my trajectory because what that
00:36:47 means now is that I'll get
00:36:49 like that's like uh that's like an extra
00:36:51 hundred dollars that's like an extra hundred dollars
00:36:53 I'll get every year for the rest of my life
00:36:55 for doing nothing and then every time I find
00:36:57 a hack like that I feel like
00:36:59 that's an extra hundred dollars I'll get a year
00:37:01 every for the rest of my life well
00:37:03 that's a hundred dollars worth of work
00:37:05 that I don't have to worry about doing
00:37:07 ever again
00:37:09 uh that's why it's so gratifying
00:37:11 when I find a trick or a
00:37:13 cheat or something
00:37:15 uh yeah this is how
00:37:17 this is how it's
00:37:19 I make it fun for me
00:37:21 cheating the system
00:37:23 imagine if I get a job
00:37:25 imagine if I get a job and then I'm gonna get a salary
00:37:27 and I'm like oh to me they'll pay me like
00:37:29 twice a month I'm cheating this system so bad
00:37:31 I hacked it guys wait until
00:37:33 the people online hear about this
00:37:35 this this this incredible
00:37:37 life hack that I found you mean that capital
00:37:39 owners will just will just pay
00:37:41 you they'll just compensate you for labor
00:37:43 holy shit
00:37:45 uh
00:37:47 yeah
00:37:51 yeah
00:37:53 um I think I've said this
00:37:55 before I think I should I think I should
00:37:57 probably
00:37:59 I think I should probably look into
00:38:01 some form of real job
00:38:03 it may be maybe later this year
00:38:05 after after I do the
00:38:07 after after I do the the
00:38:09 the slime and punishment kickstarter and maybe
00:38:11 pump out one more lecture at that point I think
00:38:13 I might be like alright
00:38:15 time to start throwing my resume around
00:38:17 and see if I can't find a
00:38:19 a real job with benefits
00:38:21 and you know I can still do lectures
00:38:23 in my spare time I can still do the
00:38:25 I can still do the perfect comic
00:38:27 party in my spare time
00:38:29 uh but yeah
00:38:33 look like look like dental
00:38:35 look like dental insurance for instance
00:38:37 I thought you were gonna go yeah I'll
00:38:39 get a job being a dentist let's do that
00:38:41 no
00:38:43 no you know I could make a pretty good
00:38:45 dentist I've
00:38:47 put stuff on my teeth before I got a
00:38:49 pretty good bedside manner
00:38:51 I got a good old set of chompers
00:38:53 here I got a pretty decent
00:38:55 set of chompers I could do I have a couple
00:38:57 I mean I have a couple cavities that need
00:38:59 that need some work
00:39:01 what if that was how you get a dentist job
00:39:03 you come in you show them how cool your teeth are
00:39:05 how well you've brushed them
00:39:07 you come in and you're like here's my resume
00:39:09 yeah I graduated from dental school
00:39:11 uh I've been
00:39:13 you know interning at dental college
00:39:15 for years
00:39:17 give me a job and they're like hmm
00:39:19 but I see from your record that you haven't
00:39:21 you haven't lived the life you haven't had
00:39:23 enough cavities filled yet we're gonna have to drill
00:39:25 it you have to be on the other side
00:39:27 of the drill before we'll let you
00:39:29 we'll let you be on our side
00:39:31 so you know
00:39:33 open wide bitch
00:39:35 fucker
00:39:37 we're gonna root canalia
00:39:39 how can you how can you how can you trust you
00:39:41 to deliver a root canal
00:39:43 if you can't if you
00:39:45 can't take a root canal
00:39:47 I've just thought about what
00:39:49 dentist school would be like there's probably like skulls
00:39:51 all over the place and it's like alright
00:39:53 now fuck with this skull
00:39:55 alright now measure now measure the
00:39:57 the relative the width versus the height
00:39:59 you know determine determine its ethnicity
00:40:01 determine
00:40:03 determine this skull's ethnicity and it's
00:40:05 likely IQ
00:40:07 uh go do I need to know that
00:40:09 yeah uh for this school
00:40:11 you do here at
00:40:13 here at Hogwarts Dentistry
00:40:15 Hogwarts Dentistry
00:40:17 they just go wibbly wibbly splat
00:40:19 you've got no problems
00:40:21 yes and then it's done
00:40:23 and then so in their spare time
00:40:25 they just do phrenology they just
00:40:27 they just compare
00:40:29 various skulls
00:40:31 stupid most of them probably were
00:40:33 no the Hogwarts school would have a really bad
00:40:35 dental wizard
00:40:37 thing because it's British oh because it's British oh yeah
00:40:39 they would have a better
00:40:41 is there an American wizarding
00:40:43 school yeah there is
00:40:45 there is and it's like it's like
00:40:47 Native American themed I think
00:40:49 it's it's it's uh it's how
00:40:51 it's houses are based on like the
00:40:53 Thunderbird and like Quetzalcoatl and stuff
00:40:55 it's very it's very
00:40:57 strange I like
00:40:59 the Thunderbird just like Zaptos
00:41:01 my favorite Pokemon oh
00:41:03 American
00:41:05 wait let me look up American
00:41:07 psycho
00:41:09 no close
00:41:11 Ilvermorny
00:41:13 yes it is called oh god
00:41:15 it's called Ilvermorny and
00:41:17 it's houses are Thunderbird
00:41:19 Horned Serpent
00:41:21 Puckwudgy and Wampus
00:41:23 what
00:41:25 oh
00:41:27 JK you
00:41:29 JK
00:41:31 were you were you
00:41:33 were you high on Benzos
00:41:35 were you take were you were you
00:41:37 dropping Benzos when you came up with this
00:41:39 were you on Quailoos
00:41:41 were you were you taken
00:41:43 were you taken that that that Ivermectin
00:41:45 were you taken Ivermectin when you
00:41:47 heard it when you thought of Ilvermorny
00:41:49 I think we've I think we've cracked
00:41:51 the case here oh it's in Massachusetts
00:41:53 it's in Mount Greylock
00:41:55 in Massachusetts is that a real mountain
00:41:57 wait mount
00:42:01 grey
00:42:03 oh it is
00:42:05 wait how far how far is it from where I live
00:42:07 you're you're a confirmed muggle
00:42:09 you can't see it you can't see the castle
00:42:11 no that's not
00:42:13 that's not true I just didn't get my I
00:42:15 didn't get my letter by Thunderbird
00:42:17 what's
00:42:19 okay Mount
00:42:21 why is it on Mount Greylock
00:42:23 why that mountain
00:42:25 sounds cool does sound cool
00:42:27 Mount Greylock
00:42:29 Castle Grayskull
00:42:31 yes
00:42:33 from from my house
00:42:35 oh wow
00:42:37 okay it's on like the far west
00:42:39 edge of Massachusetts
00:42:41 so it's a it's a it's about
00:42:43 as far from me as anything in Massachusetts
00:42:45 can be but it's only a 40
00:42:47 oh no it's a 46 hour
00:42:49 walk yeah Lamal
00:42:51 it's a two it's a two-and-a-half hour drive
00:42:53 it's not even bad
00:42:55 it's not even bad
00:42:57 America is so fucking big
00:42:59 well now well now I know
00:43:01 it's so crazy that
00:43:03 you you have such a huge country
00:43:05 and so much of your
00:43:07 infrastructure is road based when
00:43:09 that's so inefficient for such
00:43:11 large distances
00:43:13 I saw some
00:43:15 gas this is because you just have
00:43:17 so much gas but like Lamal
00:43:19 this was this was a while ago I saw
00:43:21 someone tweet about like
00:43:23 it was like stop
00:43:25 stop stop stop
00:43:27 comparing the US is like rail
00:43:29 infrastructure to like Europe's
00:43:31 and it was like
00:43:33 placed
00:43:35 and it like placed the like the US
00:43:37 against Europe and it basically the
00:43:39 point of it was it visually suggested
00:43:41 that like the US has more open
00:43:43 space and therefore rail
00:43:45 is more inefficient
00:43:47 and it's like literally the opposite
00:43:49 is true literally the more open
00:43:51 space there is the more necessary
00:43:53 the more if the more energy
00:43:55 like high-speed rail saves
00:43:57 like that's the reason you build it is
00:43:59 you traverse empty space efficiently
00:44:01 you build you're what you're
00:44:03 doing with a rail is you're building
00:44:05 like the most frictionless possible
00:44:07 road
00:44:09 ever have and you don't even need to
00:44:11 like worry about
00:44:13 swerving into a tree
00:44:15 yeah
00:44:17 no guys obviously better
00:44:19 no guys no guys it's it's much
00:44:21 more efficient to have every
00:44:23 in every individual like person or
00:44:25 pair of two people or three people
00:44:27 every every group of like one
00:44:29 person or more has to have
00:44:31 their own little vehicle that's powered
00:44:33 itself and spend its own gas to
00:44:35 individually traverse like 14 states
00:44:37 yeah
00:44:39 it just makes it just makes sense
00:44:41 it's just more
00:44:43 sensible
00:44:45 road trips on in principle
00:44:47 seem like a cool idea and they're
00:44:49 often romanticized
00:44:51 hmm
00:44:53 and I get it like if you just want to
00:44:55 drive to a specific location or just
00:44:57 like a camp
00:44:59 on the side of the road that is
00:45:01 you can't do with a train
00:45:03 but like yeah I don't know
00:45:05 maybe it should be just for road trips
00:45:07 if you I mean if you want to like
00:45:09 stop
00:45:11 like oh I need to get somewhere I have
00:45:13 to bring the car
00:45:15 it's like oh it's a fucking million
00:45:17 year drive
00:45:19 if you want to like stop all over the
00:45:21 place and see all kinds of things then
00:45:23 yeah a train
00:45:25 will not let you do that
00:45:27 or not not as easily
00:45:29 so yeah it's not it's not like I think
00:45:31 it's not like I think cars are just bad
00:45:33 but like yeah as
00:45:35 like as an argument
00:45:37 against trains like hey guys
00:45:39 but there's so much more space is like the worst
00:45:41 argument I've ever heard
00:45:43 um it's literally the opposite
00:45:45 of what you're of what you're trying
00:45:47 to say
00:45:49 um
00:45:51 they build trains all over China
00:45:53 and instead
00:45:55 they were gonna you know they were gonna they were gonna build trains
00:45:57 across California but then Elon Musk said
00:45:59 no no I'll build the hyperloop no no I'll build the hyperloop
00:46:01 I said okay
00:46:03 yeah it's funny when I learned that
00:46:05 is that the reason that hasn't
00:46:07 been plans put in place
00:46:09 is because Elon convinced the governmental
00:46:11 body or something
00:46:13 yeah like convinced enough people
00:46:15 to not invest in the rail network
00:46:17 because of what he was gonna do
00:46:19 and then he didn't do anything he just sort of
00:46:21 quietly abandoned the hyperloop
00:46:23 he's not doing anything anymore
00:46:25 I mean it is he's not talking about it
00:46:27 I mean it exists but it's
00:46:29 like stupid oh yeah
00:46:31 the final well
00:46:33 it was never said that that was the
00:46:35 final project but that is
00:46:37 the car tunnel that
00:46:39 one car tunnel wasn't that supposed
00:46:41 to be some different project
00:46:43 like I'm gonna put a tunnel under the
00:46:45 ground
00:46:47 and that was separate from
00:46:49 the hyperloop which was going to be
00:46:51 a specific motor transport
00:46:53 that may or may not have been under the ground
00:46:57 I don't know
00:46:59 and he had so many terrible ideas
00:47:01 he said 10
00:47:03 11 years ago he said in 10 years he'd put a man
00:47:05 on Mars
00:47:09 and now he's
00:47:11 explode in rockets
00:47:13 now he's exploding rockets and he's charging
00:47:15 $8 for
00:47:17 he's pretending that celebrities paid $8
00:47:19 for Twitter
00:47:21 that is odd
00:47:23 I assume you've seen the drill stuff
00:47:25 some of it yeah
00:47:27 some of it yeah
00:47:29 I didn't realize I had been unfollowed
00:47:31 from him somehow I guess
00:47:33 something happened and I didn't notice
00:47:35 because I was following him and I wasn't
00:47:37 he specifically soft blocked
00:47:39 you he didn't like you
00:47:41 but I got back
00:47:43 I'm back and back
00:47:45 better than ever yes good
00:47:47 but yeah for a little while
00:47:49 there
00:47:51 he had a
00:47:53 blue check mark applied to his account
00:47:55 despite not paying for it
00:47:57 by Twitter
00:47:59 or maybe even by Elon specifically
00:48:01 also Stephen King
00:48:03 and LeBron James
00:48:05 and apparently there's a bunch of people with
00:48:07 like more than a million Twitter followers
00:48:09 people that had specifically said
00:48:11 no I won't pay for the blue check mark
00:48:13 Jason Alexander
00:48:15 uh yeah
00:48:17 I think Jacksepticeye
00:48:19 in a weird
00:48:21 stupid attempt I think
00:48:23 to make it look like
00:48:25 it's cool to have the check mark
00:48:27 yes
00:48:29 uh Lamana
00:48:31 see guys it's not
00:48:33 it's not just
00:48:35 weird crypto perverts
00:48:37 and Elon simps
00:48:39 and like mentally ill maga people
00:48:41 it's not just them it's also
00:48:43 people you like like LeBron James
00:48:45 and Stephen King it's cool
00:48:47 I promise
00:48:49 such a like a
00:48:51 if that wasn't Elon I'm pretty sure I would have been
00:48:53 an Elon idea like oh we've got to think of something
00:48:55 to do how about this
00:48:57 and then all the people that he didn't fire
00:48:59 because there's you know
00:49:01 they suck up to him I guess
00:49:03 would be like oh yeah sure
00:49:05 and it's like so short-sighted
00:49:07 he's no
00:49:09 like for such a future minded
00:49:11 you know like
00:49:13 really in the future like tech bro
00:49:15 wizard
00:49:17 he doesn't think very far ahead at
00:49:19 all for anything like he doesn't think
00:49:21 that oh as soon as these people realize
00:49:23 that they're subscribed to twitter blue
00:49:25 with the check mark even though they didn't want that
00:49:27 they're going to say something about it
00:49:29 and then it's going to be revealed
00:49:31 very very obviously
00:49:33 that this is
00:49:35 pathetic on twitter's part
00:49:37 I I mean
00:49:39 I read a think piece the other
00:49:41 day
00:49:43 actually it was like a long twitter thread
00:49:45 but it was essentially a think piece
00:49:47 and it was about
00:49:49 and it was about how elons
00:49:51 kind of like with the trains
00:49:53 in California
00:49:55 how like what the like
00:49:57 the thesis of this piece
00:49:59 what the pieces
00:50:01 if you will was that like
00:50:03 Elon makes money
00:50:05 by sabotaging
00:50:07 public works
00:50:09 and then like positioning himself
00:50:11 to profit off of their destruction
00:50:13 and like that's
00:50:15 what he did with you know
00:50:17 by just by destroying
00:50:19 plans for like high speed rail in California
00:50:21 you know he increased
00:50:23 you know the market value of like
00:50:25 things like electric car stuff
00:50:27 and Tesla and all that
00:50:29 and I don't know I think
00:50:31 this guy was kind of suggesting that maybe he's doing the same thing
00:50:33 with twitter like
00:50:35 by basically by destroying what was
00:50:37 basically
00:50:39 by deliberately destroying what was basically
00:50:41 the public square
00:50:43 of the internet he positions himself
00:50:45 to potentially to potentially profit
00:50:47 off it but I don't know about that because he literally
00:50:49 owns it he literally owns it himself
00:50:51 and has personal stake in it so I don't know
00:50:53 if you can really argue that he's going to profit off
00:50:55 of buying it
00:50:57 and then destroying it and then
00:50:59 somehow I know I think he actually
00:51:01 is just just fucking out I mean
00:51:03 I'm sure that was like
00:51:05 part of the reason he made the joke in the first place
00:51:07 is that
00:51:09 that's how he operates he just thinks
00:51:11 oh you know this car company
00:51:13 this Tesla car company
00:51:15 you know they're making electric cars
00:51:17 what if I was the guy
00:51:19 who was getting you know
00:51:21 I can have a piece of that
00:51:23 and PayPal
00:51:25 or whatever like he's always been
00:51:27 the guy involved
00:51:29 but not really
00:51:31 important to a lot of these
00:51:33 things that he's like
00:51:35 rolled up in but Twitter was a little different
00:51:37 because he got like
00:51:39 he didn't want to buy it
00:51:41 he got legally obligated to buy it
00:51:43 for extremely large sum
00:51:45 and you try as much as he could
00:51:47 you couldn't get out of it
00:51:49 and that is the funniest
00:51:51 I have seen reports
00:51:53 that there is um
00:51:55 I don't know I've seen
00:51:57 I keep hearing about all these like lawsuits
00:51:59 that are potentially being incurred
00:52:01 that Elon's Twitter is potentially incurring
00:52:03 and I just hope
00:52:05 every time I see one I'm like I hope this is real
00:52:07 hope this is really happening
00:52:11 I heard that like you know a bunch of like hate
00:52:13 speech laws in Germany
00:52:15 because you know Germany really doesn't like Nazi stuff
00:52:17 so like the fact that
00:52:19 Elon's Twitter is like so permissive of Nazi stuff
00:52:21 it's like pretty
00:52:23 has incurred a bunch of like lawsuits from like the German
00:52:25 government apparently
00:52:27 um what was another one
00:52:29 I'm sure there's more than that
00:52:31 I don't remember
00:52:33 um oh the
00:52:35 thing with pretending celebrities
00:52:37 bought the check mark is a thing called like false
00:52:39 false endorsement
00:52:41 or something like that
00:52:43 so like that's potentially illegal
00:52:47 which I hope he goes to jail
00:52:49 I don't know
00:52:51 he won't go to jail
00:52:53 I mean as long as the threats there and there's like a credible
00:52:55 like
00:52:57 potential
00:52:59 that somebody could actually file
00:53:01 for something because if there's a bunch of celebrities
00:53:03 they probably have lawyers
00:53:05 some of them will probably want to follow that up
00:53:07 and there's a lot of
00:53:09 like
00:53:11 deceased celebrities who still have
00:53:13 Twitter accounts that have been given the check mark
00:53:15 oh that's so cool
00:53:17 like Chadwick Boseman
00:53:19 Norm MacDonald I saw a tweet
00:53:21 posting them I'm like oh yeah
00:53:23 yeah there are states
00:53:25 so I'm not gonna be happy about that
00:53:27 oh that's awesome
00:53:29 that rules
00:53:33 I say estates but you know
00:53:35 whoever is involved family
00:53:37 anyone
00:53:39 hang on I need fans at least
00:53:41 I need a sparkling water
00:53:43 I'd never needed a sparkling water more than I need one right
00:53:49 okay I'm back
00:53:51 so
00:53:53 what else
00:53:55 what else to have on my list
00:53:57 oh yeah speaking of
00:53:59 being deceased
00:54:01 I got
00:54:03 really sick yesterday
00:54:05 like all of a sudden
00:54:07 I was
00:54:09 also I hope was there anymore
00:54:11 not to change the subject if you wanted to say
00:54:13 anymore about Elon
00:54:15 nah I don't like him that's it I don't want to talk about that boy
00:54:17 that little rascal
00:54:19 that little baby that little diaper man
00:54:23 yeah so I got super sick
00:54:25 like Friday night
00:54:27 and then I woke up in like the wee hours
00:54:29 of Saturday
00:54:31 like
00:54:35 how detailed should I be
00:54:37 well I don't know
00:54:39 I was I had a
00:54:41 I had vomiting and diarrhea
00:54:43 and I was shivering
00:54:45 and I was feverish
00:54:47 and I was alternatingly hot and cold
00:54:49 and I it was like really hot in my room
00:54:51 I turned my heater up really hot because I was shivering
00:54:53 but then I would get in my bed
00:54:55 and I would cover myself in blankets then I was like
00:54:57 like pouring sweat
00:54:59 that sounds like food poisoning
00:55:01 and or flu
00:55:03 you think it might have been food poisoning
00:55:05 I think that can happen with food poisoning
00:55:07 diarrhea involved
00:55:09 I thought it might have been that I ate something
00:55:11 bad but like I didn't
00:55:13 I didn't
00:55:15 well there was that one time
00:55:17 I was diet dumpster diving
00:55:19 for scraps
00:55:21 I didn't eat anything that weird
00:55:23 except I mean I was
00:55:25 I was making
00:55:27 I was doing licorice stuff
00:55:29 I was trying to create licorice
00:55:31 but there's nothing that weird in that
00:55:33 you made some fucked up licorice
00:55:35 I don't think I did there's nothing that weird in it
00:55:37 it's just and I had done it before
00:55:39 with all the same ingredients
00:55:41 and I had been fine
00:55:43 so I don't know why I would get
00:55:45 food poisoning this time
00:55:47 I mean it's just it's corn syrup
00:55:49 molasses
00:55:51 starch
00:55:53 flour
00:55:55 there was a lot you know food coloring
00:55:57 I mean it could just be flu
00:55:59 might have just been the flu
00:56:01 it was um
00:56:03 I'm pretty much fine now
00:56:05 I'm like I'm still kind of like
00:56:07 feeling like weirdly sweaty
00:56:09 about it but other than that
00:56:11 I don't feel that feverish anymore
00:56:13 it was just
00:56:15 all Saturday all Saturday
00:56:17 I was just in bed
00:56:19 I just could not get up
00:56:21 just don't get up
00:56:23 just try to sleep
00:56:25 it was exactly like when I had COVID
00:56:27 only COVID lasted like three or four days
00:56:29 and this was just like one day
00:56:35 yeah so
00:56:37 I had wanted
00:56:39 to get more Biscopades done
00:56:41 I thought I was going to do it on Saturday
00:56:43 Saturday was like okay I'm behind
00:56:45 I'm going to do it
00:56:47 and then I got sick and I wasted my whole day
00:56:49 and I couldn't do a damn thing
00:56:51 I did get some more done
00:56:53 I got a couple more pages done
00:56:55 I'm on page 13 now
00:56:57 I wouldn't count being sick as wasted day
00:56:59 you had to recover somehow
00:57:01 well it's wasted in that I didn't
00:57:03 get to use it for what I wanted to
00:57:05 sure
00:57:07 but I did get some pages done
00:57:09 I was going into Saturday
00:57:11 Friday night I was like
00:57:13 tomorrow
00:57:15 I'm going to spend the whole day
00:57:17 I'm going to get at least three more done
00:57:23 but I did
00:57:25 do more this week
00:57:27 so I don't feel too bad
00:57:33 I'm nearing
00:57:35 a point of being
00:57:37 like okay that's the chapter
00:57:39 done I don't know exactly when I'm going to
00:57:41 I don't know exactly what
00:57:43 I don't know exactly what moment
00:57:45 I'm going to end the chapter
00:57:47 on some like minor
00:57:49 cliffhanger probably
00:57:53 but anyway being sick was
00:57:55 bad felt very bad
00:57:57 didn't like it
00:58:01 I'm trying to think
00:58:03 if there's anything
00:58:05 there's nothing that weird
00:58:07 in the licorice
00:58:09 I mean probably wouldn't
00:58:11 be a licorice if it's like
00:58:13 if you have all the ingredients and none of them
00:58:15 will rancid or anything
00:58:17 it's just fine
00:58:19 it's all the same stuff
00:58:21 it's all the same stuff that I do
00:58:23 that I make candy out of
00:58:25 any other time
00:58:27 you probably just got like a COVID mini
00:58:33 maybe I mean I
00:58:37 I ate a very over right
00:58:39 banana
00:58:41 but it wasn't like rotten or moldy
00:58:43 it was just like brown and mushy
00:58:45 I put it in a pudding
00:58:47 I doubt a banana would have that
00:58:53 food poisoning is like raw meat
00:58:55 usually isn't it
00:58:57 meat that's not cooked well enough
00:58:59 chicken often
00:59:03 I come sort of
00:59:05 I cook all my meat
00:59:07 I swear I cook all my meat
00:59:11 I do I mean I eat
00:59:13 I mean I put bacon in my lentils
00:59:15 but I cook it in the rice cooker
00:59:17 and I think that's fine
00:59:21 I don't see as long as it looks cooked afterwards
00:59:23 I don't see why that would be weird
00:59:27 googling cooking bacon in rice cooker
00:59:29 I mean it's kind of boiling
00:59:31 bacon isn't it rather than
00:59:33 basically basically yeah
00:59:35 so like boiled ham like you can do that
00:59:37 okay odd but like
00:59:39 no no no I'm seeing recipes
00:59:41 I'm seeing recipes
00:59:43 on google that are like
00:59:45 yeah make stuff with bacon
00:59:47 in rice cooker
00:59:49 so
00:59:51 I should try that honestly I haven't tried that yet
00:59:53 it's it's
00:59:55 we got a little rice cooker
00:59:57 do you use it
00:59:59 for rice yeah
01:00:01 you know I haven't actually used mine for rice
01:00:05 so just lentils and
01:00:07 okay yeah pretty much all I use it for
01:00:09 is lentils
01:00:11 because like a protein
01:00:13 I mean what I like to do is
01:00:15 I'm sure it would
01:00:17 you know what's really good
01:00:19 rice
01:00:21 spam and sesame oil
01:00:23 that's a that's and salt
01:00:25 that's a winning combination
01:00:29 half spam
01:00:31 do you have sesame oil
01:00:37 love sesame oil
01:00:39 I had a friend
01:00:41 in California
01:00:43 I had a friend in California who had a
01:00:45 girlfriend
01:00:47 a Korean girlfriend who would make
01:00:49 she would make basically like sashimi
01:00:51 but it would be like rice
01:00:53 and instead of like fish or whatever
01:00:55 it would be a rice ball
01:00:57 on top of a slice of spam
01:00:59 cooked in sesame oil
01:01:01 and they were so good
01:01:05 yeah
01:01:07 that makes me want to make that
01:01:09 I don't even have rice
01:01:11 but I could get some
01:01:13 yeah I just
01:01:15 try to keep my protein up
01:01:17 so I try to
01:01:19 other than my candy stuff
01:01:21 now I try not to eat anything
01:01:23 that doesn't have protein in it
01:01:29 now I'm nervous
01:01:31 now I'm nervous that something I ate
01:01:33 made me sick and it's going to make me sick again
01:01:35 I mean other than like the ingredients
01:01:37 being
01:01:39 contaminated is the kitchen clean
01:01:41 yeah
01:01:43 the kitchen is cleanish
01:01:45 and I mean I haven't
01:01:47 maybe a rat pooped in it
01:01:49 my mom told me that when she was young
01:01:51 she got food poisoning
01:01:53 from like rat poop or something
01:01:55 cause like there were rats living in her kitchen as well
01:01:57 and she got food poisoning due to them
01:01:59 maybe I got rat poop
01:02:01 but I haven't seen a rat
01:02:03 have not seen a rat in several weeks
01:02:05 there's a cat living here in the house now
01:02:07 and I think it's scared the rats away
01:02:09 and somebody found like a rat nest
01:02:11 somewhere and got rid of it
01:02:13 so like the rat problem
01:02:15 while it would be overly optimistic to say that it's over
01:02:17 it's decreased
01:02:19 so you know I'd be
01:02:21 surprised
01:02:23 I'd be surprised if it were rat related
01:02:25 but I guess
01:02:27 you can't you can't
01:02:29 you can never be sure
01:02:35 what a life
01:02:37 what a life
01:02:39 hey you know what I did
01:02:43 I did the anime
01:02:45 do you want to see
01:02:47 do you want to see
01:02:49 I realized that I forgot a few
01:02:51 they're like
01:02:53 OVA's there was one about like a cellist
01:02:55 in the woods
01:02:57 and he has like a hallucination
01:02:59 slash little stories
01:03:01 with animals
01:03:03 and he's like the most best cellist
01:03:05 ever
01:03:07 and I liked that but I forgot to put it on the list
01:03:09 and I don't really think of it as like a show
01:03:11 cause it was like
01:03:13 no it was a film
01:03:15 I wouldn't have put it on the list
01:03:17 I wouldn't have put it on the list anyway
01:03:19 but then there was like
01:03:21 Treasure Island
01:03:23 an adaptation of Treasure Island
01:03:25 the Russian one
01:03:27 no it was the Japanese
01:03:29 sorry to interrupt but have you seen
01:03:31 Takashima
01:03:33 have you seen the Russian Treasure Island
01:03:35 I have not
01:03:39 Takashima's Treasure Island
01:03:41 yeah in 1978
01:03:45 it's got
01:03:47 I remember really liking it
01:03:49 I mean it's Treasure Island so I know the story
01:03:51 but like
01:03:53 really cool animation
01:03:55 what's the Russian one
01:03:57 wait no it's not Russian
01:04:01 ah fuck
01:04:03 maybe if I just look for weird treasure island
01:04:07 fucked up Treasure Island
01:04:09 yeah there's one
01:04:11 where the animation is just
01:04:13 so bizarre
01:04:15 oh no
01:04:19 oh it's called Treasure Planet
01:04:21 from 1982
01:04:25 obviously different from the Disney one I guess
01:04:27 yes
01:04:29 but it's funny that
01:04:31 there was another adaptation of Treasure Island
01:04:33 called Treasure Planet
01:04:35 much earlier
01:04:38 I'll just show you some screenshots
01:04:40 Treasure Planet
01:04:42 1982
01:04:44 there's like a
01:04:46 Sakuga in this show the Treasure Island
01:04:48 in 1978
01:04:52 I just want to find a good gift
01:04:54 it's got the little leopard
01:04:56 leopard cub
01:04:58 here we go
01:05:00 here we go
01:05:02 anyway that would be high up on the list

01:05:22 yeah I thought it was a wheelchair
01:05:27 yeah this is a real movie I've watched this movie
01:05:32 if you remember
01:05:35 what was that fucking show
01:05:37 that I did
01:05:39 if you remember
01:05:41 The Fleet Pit
01:05:42 if you remember Live at the Fleet Pit
01:05:44 I reviewed this movie on that
01:05:46 and it's kind of
01:05:48 you know it all
01:05:50 it all looks like this
01:05:52 yeah is the jerky
01:05:54 motion of the arms
01:05:56 but like the face
01:05:58 is like a single image that they're obviously
01:06:00 just shifting around
01:06:02 there's
01:06:04 moving around
01:06:06 making me feel like South Park almost
01:06:10 there's lots of gifts
01:06:12 and I don't know
01:06:14 I could post more
01:06:16 but you get the idea
01:06:18 but anyway
01:06:20 do you want to look at my list here
01:06:22 yes
01:06:24 my challenge list
01:06:28 I actually have
01:06:30 watched a lot of anime
01:06:32 I kind of forgot
01:06:34 I've seen more than
01:06:36 60 of them
01:06:38 I was on my
01:06:40 stream
01:06:42 and I had to ask stream people
01:06:44 to remind me about
01:06:46 anime that aired around
01:06:48 a certain time
01:06:50 of my life
01:06:52 and people just threw out lots of suggestions
01:06:54 and most of them I was like no never heard of it
01:06:56 no never heard of it
01:06:58 and they'd be like oh yeah that one
01:07:00 like oh yeah Cromartie High
01:07:02 oh yeah Big O
01:07:04 oh yeah Steel Angel Karumi
01:07:06 Paranoia Agents
01:07:10 Lupin
01:07:12 yeah oh my god
01:07:14 wow there's so many
01:07:16 yeah
01:07:20 kind of too many
01:07:22 to like go over
01:07:24 I felt bad for
01:07:26 everything that had to go up
01:07:28 against Fuli Kuli like early on
01:07:30 like Barakaman
01:07:32 and Garzi's Wing
01:07:34 and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji
01:07:36 all get knocked out really early
01:07:38 even though those are all really good
01:07:40 just because it's Fuli Kuli
01:07:42 Fuli Kuli did end up winning
01:07:44 unsurprisingly
01:07:46 but in the second to last round
01:07:48 I did have Fuli Kuli vs Gurren Lagann
01:07:50 oh my god Madoka Magica
01:07:52 I did watch that
01:07:54 I forgot that one
01:07:58 Golden Boy vs Madoka Magica
01:08:00 was really hard too
01:08:02 I kind of hated
01:08:04 knocking Golden Boy off
01:08:10 I think I tried to watch the first episode
01:08:12 was that the space one
01:08:14 it's the space one that's like 500 episodes long
01:08:18 I've watched half of it
01:08:20 a lot of the one
01:08:22 that was on this list I've only seen a little bit of
01:08:26 most of them I've seen at least
01:08:28 most of them I've watched all of
01:08:30 a lot of them I've just watched
01:08:32 like a decent amount of
01:08:34 like Jojo Part 3
01:08:36 I've seen most of it I haven't seen all of it
01:08:38 but I counted it
01:08:40 a couple of them
01:08:42 I'd only seen a little bit of
01:08:44 like Steel Angel Karumi
01:08:46 I think I watched like 2 episodes
01:08:48 I don't remember what it's about at all
01:08:50 I've watched this list really fast
01:08:52 did I put Death Note on mine?
01:08:54 I think I did
01:08:56 I don't remember
01:08:58 there were
01:09:00 what the hell is those who hunt elves?
01:09:02 those who hunt elves
01:09:04 I don't know it's like some stupid
01:09:06 like fantasy
01:09:08 show about a group
01:09:10 it's like a weird etchy
01:09:12 like fantasy
01:09:14 comedy about some
01:09:16 you know
01:09:18 it's like a fantasy world where
01:09:20 they
01:09:22 they have to
01:09:24 they don't hunt the elves
01:09:26 I think what they do
01:09:28 is they have to find out who is an elf
01:09:30 and who is not an elf
01:09:32 and it's straight up just like
01:09:34 to see if you're an elf they have to like look at their tits
01:09:36 or something
01:09:38 it's about like stripping people
01:09:40 and like looking at them naked to see if they're elves
01:09:42 because elves have like a magic tattoo
01:09:44 or some shit like that
01:09:46 intriguing
01:09:48 yeah
01:09:50 yeah that one didn't
01:09:52 I don't think that one made it very far
01:09:54 no it was immediately
01:09:56 defeated by kill a kill
01:09:58 oh another one sided
01:10:00 match up there
01:10:02 um
01:10:04 let's see let me look for some other
01:10:06 Azumanga Dio
01:10:08 no I don't think I've seen enough of that to count it
01:10:10 I like Azumanga Dio
01:10:12 I haven't really seen Nietzsche Joe
01:10:14 or that's like that in Azumanga Dio
01:10:16 are like kind of similar
01:10:18 people tell me Nietzsche Joe you should watch
01:10:20 and I'm like I've seen
01:10:22 when it was coming out
01:10:24 or around like earlier
01:10:26 I'm like oh I've seen gifts of that
01:10:28 I've seen when she suplexes a goat
01:10:30 or something
01:10:32 I've seen like funny like
01:10:34 oh it's like a little cute girl
01:10:36 but she is like animated
01:10:38 and over the top fashion
01:10:40 to deliver some sort of
01:10:42 punch
01:10:44 or something and I'm like yeah I get it
01:10:46 I don't need to watch that I get it
01:10:48 that's the joke
01:10:50 it sure is
01:10:52 people always say oh it's so fucking wacky
01:10:54 and I'm like well is it fun
01:10:56 is it nice is it cute is it wholesome
01:10:58 is it anything other than wacky
01:11:00 and they never say anything
01:11:02 because I don't remember just to tell them
01:11:04 oh dear
01:11:06 that's not good
01:11:08 I'm sure it's fine
01:11:12 probably might be a pretty hot take
01:11:14 here but I had
01:11:16 I have
01:11:18 Excel Saga Beats Lucky Star
01:11:20 in my first
01:11:22 in my first
01:11:24 I liked Lucky Star but
01:11:26 I don't know what Excel Saga will say
01:11:28 I liked Lucky Star fine
01:11:30 Excel Saga is like a
01:11:32 it's like a parody anime
01:11:34 about like
01:11:36 I don't know
01:11:38 it's
01:11:40 God how do I even
01:11:42 it's a comedy about
01:11:44 these girls
01:11:46 who join an evil organization
01:11:48 bent on world domination
01:11:50 and basically every episode is like
01:11:52 their stupid boss
01:11:54 sends them on some mission to like
01:11:56 here's how we're gonna
01:11:58 it's like pinky in the brain like how are we gonna take over the world
01:12:00 this time pinky
01:12:02 and every episode is like they try to take over
01:12:04 the world in a way that
01:12:06 parodies like some very specific like anime genre
01:12:08 like they try to take over the world
01:12:10 by going to the beach
01:12:12 and being the hottest girls on the beach
01:12:14 or they try to take over the world by
01:12:16 having a
01:12:18 there's a post apocalypse desert
01:12:20 where you have to ride motorcycles around
01:12:22 and do a fist of the north star
01:12:24 type stuff etc etc
01:12:26 and it's just
01:12:28 fucking funny and wacky and you know what
01:12:30 it left a bigger impression on me than
01:12:32 lucky started so it
01:12:34 wins
01:12:40 chris chan famously was a big
01:12:42 excel saga fan
01:12:46 which gave a lot of points obviously
01:12:48 i notice you have
01:12:50 jojo part three but no other parts
01:12:52 i have only i have not seen any other parts
01:12:56 is jojo jojo seems to be one of those
01:12:58 anime where like different seasons of
01:13:00 the show are considered different things
01:13:02 yeah
01:13:04 so like you can say oh i love jojo
01:13:06 part two but if you just
01:13:08 say i love jojo's bizarre adventure
01:13:10 people will always ask
01:13:12 a follow up questions like well which part
01:13:14 yeah i mean
01:13:16 as opposed to like any other show where it's like
01:13:18 a long running show that has
01:13:20 like arcs wait actually
01:13:22 now i might be confused
01:13:24 i might not even be talking about three
01:13:26 i'm talking about the one that has
01:13:28 um josuke and
01:13:30 shining diamonds that might
01:13:32 be four actually i might be i might be on
01:13:34 on weed
01:13:36 but yeah
01:13:38 i know i've heard of like what happens
01:13:40 in the early jojo parts and it doesn't even
01:13:42 sound like remotely similar
01:13:44 to what happens in the later ones
01:13:48 so you know
01:13:50 whatever
01:13:52 yeah what's golden boy
01:13:54 golden boy is

01:18:58 anime moments
01:19:00 um
01:19:02 what
01:19:04 have you seen have you seen a chromarty high
01:19:06 is that the one with
01:19:08 the
01:19:10 the walking down the hallway
01:19:12 okay okay okay
01:19:14 yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:19:16 yeah we re we replicated
01:19:18 that at radcon one or two
01:19:20 oh yeah but have you seen it though
01:19:22 no that's good
01:19:24 it's very funny
01:19:26 um
01:19:28 yeah there's lots of things i've heard about
01:19:30 watched a couple episodes of on chibi backers
01:19:32 maybe um
01:19:34 oh wait i didn't include s cry
01:19:36 ed no
01:19:38 show that i always say is kind of good
01:19:40 yeah
01:19:42 damn it
01:19:44 ah
01:19:46 fuck no
01:19:48 instead of steel angel karumi
01:19:50 um
01:19:52 the only one that i realize i didn't
01:19:54 put on the list here was medica magica
01:19:56 and i don't have a lot of like
01:19:58 i don't have a lot of like oh
01:20:00 what you thought this was better than
01:20:02 that moment like i don't have that
01:20:04 yeah i guess if you don't know most of these
01:20:06 um i was bummed that
01:20:08 that tatami galaxy got knocked out
01:20:10 like immediately
01:20:12 and i felt a little weird
01:20:14 like having soul eater beat it
01:20:16 you ever seen soul eater
01:20:18 i watched
01:20:20 no no we for chibi backers we watched three episodes
01:20:22 i like so i think
01:20:24 i like soul eater a lot
01:20:26 uh i thought it was really good
01:20:28 i thought the ending
01:20:30 was really the ending is really shit
01:20:32 it has a really shitty ending
01:20:34 it they kind of do the thing how in like
01:20:36 in the original full metal alchemist anime
01:20:38 they just completely change the
01:20:40 ending to something else because like the
01:20:42 manga was still going they do that with soul eater
01:20:44 but instead of being cool like in out
01:20:46 full metal alchemist it's it sucks
01:20:48 um yeah i've heard
01:20:50 lots of things about soul eater's
01:20:52 endings yeah it's just dumb
01:20:54 um but it's a good show
01:20:56 but i like tatami galaxy a lot too
01:20:58 and i would usually give the edge to a
01:21:00 show that's shorter like tatami galaxy is
01:21:02 like a short ova which basically
01:21:04 makes it automatically better in most cases
01:21:06 but i don't know um
01:21:08 what i remember most about tatami galaxy
01:21:10 is just like its art style
01:21:12 and like the the plot
01:21:14 itself i like remember
01:21:16 it but i don't remember it that
01:21:18 well i just i have a lot more
01:21:20 like oh yeah remember
01:21:22 what when that happened oh yeah remember
01:21:24 that character from soul eater
01:21:26 so i had to give it to soul eater
01:21:28 which is very strange
01:21:30 yeah oh yes this one
01:21:32 i've seen clips of this one a lot
01:21:34 tatami galaxy oh yeah
01:21:36 yeah very it's a cool cool
01:21:38 looking show cool looking show
01:21:40 by the way i don't know if i mentioned
01:21:42 uh the last time i had
01:21:44 with with the um the list
01:21:46 i hadn't finished utana
01:21:48 now i have oh
01:21:50 how was that revolutionary
01:21:52 revolutionary girl utana is
01:21:54 um
01:21:56 something that immediately needs
01:21:58 a big long analysis video
01:22:00 afterwards because i don't get it
01:22:02 you don't you're not you're so
01:22:04 fucking thick with
01:22:06 uh insinuation themes
01:22:08 but like insinuation
01:22:10 and metaphor rather than
01:22:12 over like direct dialogue
01:22:14 um so
01:22:16 insinuation of
01:22:18 sex
01:22:20 uh yes i mean there's literal sex
01:22:22 that are there's lots of
01:22:24 it's it's not um
01:22:28 yeah i can't really speak
01:22:30 on the themes even though
01:22:32 i watched some good videos
01:22:34 even trixie's old video was good
01:22:36 on utana
01:22:38 on utana there was a comment
01:22:40 under it it was like oh i always thought it was
01:22:42 like a woman's perspective of utana
01:22:44 and haha turns out i was right lol
01:22:46 pretty funny pretty
01:22:48 drool yeah um but then
01:22:50 there was another one another two or three
01:22:52 that i watched i was like okay
01:22:54 i think i get it but i couldn't
01:22:56 recount it i couldn't like tell you
01:22:58 what utana is about all i know is
01:23:00 uh i loved it
01:23:02 it was great it's very tragic
01:23:04 and very soulful
01:23:06 and um
01:23:08 but like uplifting near the end like
01:23:10 it's sort of like a it's a cliff
01:23:12 hanger like not a cliffhanger but sort of
01:23:14 like a you don't really see
01:23:16 what happens at the very end but like
01:23:18 if you follow the themes and what
01:23:20 you know the show is
01:23:22 telling you oh like how
01:23:24 like how in the green night you don't actually see
01:23:26 him cut his head off
01:23:28 yes
01:23:30 like if you if you take what
01:23:32 the show is telling you
01:23:34 non-directly you can figure out
01:23:36 basically what is what's happened and you're
01:23:38 like okay the movie
01:23:40 um
01:23:42 is apparently like a clusterfuck
01:23:44 of weird shit
01:23:46 takes place in a parallel version
01:23:48 of the the show rather than
01:23:50 simple
01:23:52 like movie that is a retelling of the
01:23:54 show with a bit more animation
01:23:56 uh so i i haven't watched
01:23:58 that yet but i want to
01:24:00 um and yeah i like utanela
01:24:02 it's
01:24:04 very fucking sick
01:24:06 i'm
01:24:08 i'm eating i'm trying a new
01:24:10 recipe instead of
01:24:12 a gummy i'm trying to make like a chew
01:24:14 like a starburst sort of chew
01:24:16 and i'm trying to make
01:24:18 a version of it that does not like
01:24:20 melt you know it doesn't like
01:24:22 deform just from holding it
01:24:24 and
01:24:26 um
01:24:28 i think it needs it needs something
01:24:30 it's it's kind of like
01:24:32 it's kind of like a tootsie roll
01:24:34 but you can't just like pack tootsie rolls into
01:24:36 into a bag they're all like melt together
01:24:38 they'll stick together they might need to
01:24:40 be like coated in something
01:24:42 mirror oil talcum powder
01:24:44 talcum powder
01:24:46 maybe just like a corn starch
01:24:48 maybe just a simple a simple corn
01:24:50 starch powder
01:24:52 yeah powdery something or other
01:24:54 might do it
01:24:56 maybe maybe just like
01:24:58 a little bit of gelatin just a small
01:25:00 amount of gelatin just to kind of make
01:25:02 it hold its shape
01:25:04 that might be that might be like a
01:25:06 gelatin shellac
01:25:08 well i told you
01:25:10 that um shellac is the
01:25:12 thing that they put in starburst right
01:25:14 and oh no you didn't
01:25:16 yeah um i found this
01:25:18 out i was looking at starburst ingredients
01:25:20 and one of the ingredients is
01:25:22 well it's called quote unquote
01:25:24 confectioners glaze
01:25:26 and what confectioners glaze is
01:25:28 is shellac it's
01:25:30 the stuff that they that they that you coat
01:25:32 wood with which if you didn't know
01:25:34 is an excretion of a certain
01:25:36 insect the lack bug
01:25:38 excretes this goo that you
01:25:40 coat wood with and
01:25:42 that they that they put in starburst
01:25:44 but they don't call it that
01:25:46 because it sounds gross in food
01:25:48 in food they call it confectioners
01:25:50 glaze but it's the same bug
01:25:52 goo
01:25:54 well we've been eating bugs this whole time
01:25:56 yeah
01:25:58 and you know what
01:26:00 i'll do it again
01:26:02 i'm okay with it
01:26:04 i like starburst are we thinking of the same
01:26:06 thing starburst
01:26:08 the red and orange and pink and yellow
01:26:10 ones
01:26:12 starburst the tiny little
01:26:14 cuboids with
01:26:16 wrapping paper around each one
01:26:18 cuboids
01:26:20 yeah
01:26:22 and they come in they come in lemon and
01:26:24 strawberry and cherry and orange
01:26:26 uh yeah
01:26:28 i mean in the uk there's different flavors
01:26:30 there are apple ones
01:26:32 what strawberry black
01:26:34 berry orange
01:26:36 no if it's not
01:26:38 yeah
01:26:40 i can show a picture of such a thing
01:26:42 what the fuck
01:26:44 wait a minute
01:26:46 are you sure these are starbursts and not now and later
01:26:50 uh i don't know
01:26:52 i mean i know that strawberries are like the most
01:26:54 the default
01:26:56 starburst
01:26:58 are you sure the okay okay
01:27:00 are you sure these aren't like some like
01:27:02 other flavor
01:27:04 you can get like skittles but you can also get like
01:27:06 tropical skittles or berry
01:27:08 skittles
01:27:10 um i suppose so
01:27:12 i mean i i don't know
01:27:14 hang on
01:27:16 i'm just i'm just i mean i'm in shock and awe
01:27:18 here because i mean
01:27:20 i remember having pear flavored starburst
01:27:22 pear i mean that sounds
01:27:24 i wouldn't i wouldn't really think about being like
01:27:26 i mean yeah that sounds great just
01:27:28 to me to me like
01:27:30 this this this flavor
01:27:32 i mean i would say that's like
01:27:34 yellow pink orange red
01:27:36 is like
01:27:38 this is this is this is starburst and everything
01:27:40 else is a
01:27:42 i mean i would say that's
01:27:44 like yeah more common
01:27:46 i guess
01:27:48 i would always leave the lemon ones i think
01:27:50 i didn't like lemon the lemon it was the orange
01:27:52 i didn't like
01:27:54 strawberry is my favorite
01:27:56 i like the ice yeah but then i also really
01:27:58 like the apple ones i think lemon is the least
01:28:00 good but they're all good i don't like
01:28:02 leave any of them hang on
01:28:04 um
01:28:06 um
01:28:08 oh my god
01:28:10 uk u k starburst
01:28:12 a comparison
01:28:14 i'm just yeah i think i think
01:28:16 the main ones were like strawberry and blackberry
01:28:18 were the like the two flavors
01:28:20 and then orange
01:28:22 and lemon
01:28:24 so i guess it was just cherry that was the
01:28:26 strawberry and blackberry
01:28:28 so i guess it was just cherry that was different
01:28:30 instead of cherry i had
01:28:32 wait a minute
01:28:34 so british they okay they have an orange
01:28:36 a cherry lemon lime
01:28:38 combo and what's the what's the purple
01:28:40 and grape
01:28:42 blackberry or grape some i think
01:28:44 is blackberry
01:28:46 blackcurrant yeah
01:28:48 blackcurrant okay i'm glad it's not
01:28:50 grape because grape sucks grape is like the
01:28:52 worst flavor of anything
01:28:54 yeah um i love blackcurrant
01:28:56 blackcurrant is my like
01:28:58 i always think of blackcurrant is like the staple
01:29:00 the staple like
01:29:02 confectionary flavor is blackcurrant
01:29:04 wait wait wait okay so your red
01:29:06 is your red is cherry
01:29:08 no no your red is strawberry
01:29:10 our red is cherry and our pink is
01:29:12 strawberry so that's so that's wacky

01:29:18 blackcurrant starbursts
01:29:20 sounds oh yeah sounds pretty good

01:29:26 chew-its chew-its
01:29:28 yeah chew-its you know
01:29:30 chew-its no
01:29:32 is it like chicklets they're
01:29:34 they're very similar they're like cuboids
01:29:36 with individual wrapping just a different
01:29:38 brand and
01:29:40 they had a sour
01:29:42 what what's wrong with cuboids they're not
01:29:44 cubes i mean they're not rectangles i guess
01:29:46 they're tech i guess you're technically right they
01:29:48 are cuboids
01:29:50 they are i would call them squares
01:29:52 i'm just gonna say i would call them squares
01:29:54 nah all right cuboids
01:29:56 is funny all right um
01:29:58 chew-its had like
01:30:00 a dinosaur mascot

01:30:04 a dinosaur and i love chew-its
01:30:06 so much oh wow he really would eat them
01:30:10 there's another there's another thing
01:30:12 called now and later's
01:30:14 which are very similar to a starburst but
01:30:16 they're really hard
01:30:18 they're really hard and you pretty much have to
01:30:20 suck on them for a while until they become soft
01:30:22 enough that you can chew on them
01:30:24 where is the
01:30:26 the dinosaur
01:30:28 where's the dinosaur

01:31:34 uh this is the advert alright
01:31:36 i'm gonna post that
01:31:38 advert hopefully you can see it
01:31:40 you know what
01:31:42 yeah
01:31:44 this is
01:31:46 chew it i like to
01:31:48 i like to chew it chew it
01:31:50 okay let's give it a watch
01:31:52 i like the ChewIt
01:31:56 oh, it is
01:31:58 its the song we were thinking of
01:32:02 in the episode
01:32:03 he likes to share it
01:32:06 and
01:32:06 I
01:32:11 Thought that song was about Chewitt's and then I heard it in the Madagascar movie and I was like what why they put the Chewitt's
01:32:17 Why they put the Chewitt's song in Madagascar?
01:32:20 That's that's advertising this this Chewy this Chewy substance that I've made I
01:32:26 Think it's pretty good. I think it's maybe a little too much cornstarch
01:32:30 The
01:32:32 Consist the chewiness the consistency is about right but it's a little bit like it's firm
01:32:36 But like it like if you hold it it's sort of like deforms and starts to kind of like droop and I would rather
01:32:42 I'm thinking maybe yeah, maybe just a tiny bit of gelatin
01:32:46 Or sh or maybe maybe you can buy shellac in flakes. You have to buy it in flakes. Maybe wax. Maybe carnauba wax
01:32:56 Flavors good though
01:33:00 The first one I made had too much acid. It was too sour
01:33:04 Too sour and not sweet enough too starchy
01:33:08 So in this time I replaced half the starch that I added I press half of it with with a confectioner sugar
01:33:15 Which um I had forgotten about confectioner sugar. It turns out
01:33:20 It turns out that yeah when you just add sugar to a solution sometimes it becomes gritty and crystalline
01:33:27 Great way to not have that happen. It's just use confectioner sugar because it's finely ground and it's and it's powdery
01:33:33 They've solved this problem for me and I had forgotten
01:33:38 I'm a genius
01:33:41 Okay
01:33:43 Candy, what was the other one fruit teller?
01:33:46 Fruit teller was like fruit the non super sweet, but still quite tasty fruit flavored
01:33:53 cuboid snack
01:33:55 Hugh Brits and your in your cuboid snacks
01:33:58 We love cuboids over here. I have never seen a fruitella
01:34:05 We have fruitopia
01:34:08 We got fruitella. We got nutella. Now these ones. What else have we got? Now these ones have you a green apple
01:34:14 raspberry
01:34:15 lemon and
01:34:17 Black blackberry
01:34:20 Looks pretty good
01:34:22 Yeah, oh and then the the box has it has fruit, but the fruits are all square or cube
01:34:30 Yeah, like the products just the product so the product no
01:34:35 No, they only becomes a cube if you combine two of them together and squish them you take them out of packaging
01:34:41 You push them together. They molecularly bond to become one cube of the product. Oh, these are these are gelatin free
01:34:48 Wait, these are gelatin free wait, so what's in them?
01:34:54 Fruit no
01:34:57 No, they're veggie. They're vegetarian, which means they don't contain gelatin wait, okay. I have to know
01:35:04 fruitella fruit fruitella recipe ingredients
01:35:08 it
01:35:10 Glucose syrup sugar fully high okay fully hydrogenated coconut oil
01:35:15 Fruit juices from concentrate wait beef gelatin
01:35:22 Oh
01:35:23 Traitor
01:35:24 Well that other one said it was gelatin free. I mean maybe there's different
01:35:29 Yeah, you'd have to come and buy one find out
01:35:32 Look at the packaging numbers gum Arabic
01:35:36 Gum Arabic
01:35:39 Glisser all
01:35:42 Okay, all right, how to make fruitella at home Wow, I I think I have mentioned this
01:35:48 I have looked up um how to I have looked up recipes for licorice at to make it yourself and all the recipes that I find
01:35:55 involve like milk and eggs and
01:35:59 it's like so
01:36:01 Fucking stupid like that's obviously not what you're buying. Yeah, they all involve like like like condensed milk and
01:36:08 fucking eggs and shit
01:36:10 Like fresh eggs
01:36:12 It's like give me a break
01:36:14 Is that for like the bonding agent or something? Yeah, it's just stick it together
01:36:20 Yeah, probably it's probably like I mean, I'm sure it tastes fine
01:36:27 But it's not that's a cake. They're making there's them. That's a that's a dang cake
01:36:33 I mean the end result looks pretty good
01:36:36 You know you try you it gets this this paste this sticky like paste and you cut it into you know
01:36:42 Cuboids or whatever and I'm sure it's fine
01:36:46 But it's not you know, I want something that keeps on the shelf for ever and that you know make it with eggs
01:36:54 It's not gonna do that
01:36:57 Now hang on
01:37:00 Fuck
01:37:02 Shit, I was gonna look I was gonna look something else up, but I forgot
01:37:08 Oh well, oh
01:37:10 well
01:37:11 Yeah eggs eggs, I guess are just like
01:37:15 something that
01:37:17 Eggs, I guess are like there's something they're a good
01:37:19 They're a bonding agent that anyone would have in their kitchen
01:37:21 Like if you're just for a home cook or just a hobbyist or just someone who's like bored and wants to do make something in their kitchen
01:37:27 Like yeah, a recipe that involves eggs is like yeah, sure just go go nuts use eggs
01:37:33 Just like just like financial
01:37:35 Advice it's exactly like financial advice
01:37:38 Because you know I was watching that video by Patrick Boyle and he said
01:37:42 that like a lot of the like popular financial advice that like authors recommend is
01:37:49 stuff that
01:37:51 is kind of just wrong
01:37:53 But a lot of it is wrong in a way that is designed to like
01:37:59 Sort of account for the fact that like humans are stupid and
01:38:04 Don't behave correctly and what I mean by that is like example a lot of popular
01:38:11 Financial advice tells you to pay down your smallest debts first
01:38:16 Like if you have debts
01:38:18 Find the one that you have that's the smallest and pay that one down first
01:38:23 Whereas like
01:38:24 The right thing to do
01:38:26 By any metric is to pay down the one that has the highest interest rate
01:38:30 But I guess a lot of authors will tell you pay down the smallest one first because it's like
01:38:36 Psychologically if you successfully knock one off the list it like feels better
01:38:41 Right and so it's like
01:38:45 Kind of not
01:38:47 Right, but maybe it might get people to behave in a way that gives
01:38:52 It might you know might get them to stick with it better
01:38:55 Uh or something
01:38:57 even though it's not
01:38:59 Mathematically optimal
01:39:01 Um
01:39:05 Good thing I always do the mathematically optimal thing
01:39:09 I don't have to worry. I don't have to worry about that. Yeah, so true. It is so true. It is so true though
01:39:16 um
01:39:17 Let me look at my let me look at my notes. Let me look at my stupid notes
01:39:21 I played a video game
01:39:23 This week
01:39:25 Oh, yeah, yeah
01:39:26 Did I mention that I found?
01:39:28 phantom's revenge on some other website?
01:39:32 You did. Yeah
01:39:35 I mean, let me let me let me see if I could find it
01:39:38 Wait, no, I don't know if you did
01:39:40 You probably
01:39:42 I vaguely remember this but I think it might oh I might be confusing it for something else
01:39:46 But I don't know what else so maybe I did hear it. Wait a minute
01:39:51 Okay, no, no, I was I was thinking of I was thinking of the pump run away from snakes was found on other websites because it didn't have
01:39:59 It didn't have a link. It didn't have a
01:40:01 My name or charlie's name in the game itself
01:40:05 So there's no way to get like recognition for that. Oh really? Damn. Yeah, let's see. So for for for
01:40:13 uh, the the
01:40:15 Pumpkin alley it starts with our names
01:40:18 And there's names like in the credits
01:40:21 So even if it ends up on other sites and I think it has the little demo we made fridge
01:40:26 Uh, we've still got credit. There's links within the game itself two things that we've done
01:40:32 Yeah, phantom's revenge is like that. It says it's by ben saint and like there's links to like read the comic and stuff in it
01:40:38 So I'm not I'm not worried about
01:40:40 Yeah, it getting stolen or misattributed or whatever. Yeah, it's here on on soft tonic
01:40:46 On soft tonic.com. There is a web page
01:40:51 And yeah, they have their own write-up
01:40:54 Of the game. It's not they didn't just copy paste my write-up. They wrote
01:40:58 They wrote their own. She's kind of
01:41:01 Interesting here. I guess I'll just post the link. Why not?
01:41:04 um
01:41:05 Apparently 68 people have downloaded it from this website, which is interesting
01:41:11 Uh free download. I mean, it's free anyway. So yeah, yeah, it's free
01:41:16 On itch as well
01:41:18 uh
01:41:19 Okay
01:41:20 They are from indie for game developer ben saint. So they do credit you. Yeah. Yeah, they say developer ben saint over on the right side
01:41:28 You know, I mean whatever like I'm not not upset about it
01:41:32 With its content and the variety of activities for you to do phantom's revenge is a
01:41:37 Thoroughly enjoyable experience true for indie gaming fans. So true
01:41:43 Ooh, it is somewhat comparable to mother of many or limbo
01:41:47 Yeah, oh the colorful or more graphic aesthetic to it. I okay. I read this write-up and I went first of all limbo sucks
01:41:54 second of all, uh, I was curious about mother of many
01:41:58 So I went and I go and I and I downloaded mother of many and I played it
01:42:03 and
01:42:04 it was
01:42:06 interesting
01:42:07 But it was not what I wanted it to be. I was kind of disappointed in it
01:42:13 Yeah, I played mother of many and from the screenshot that they showed on this website
01:42:18 Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here. Here is here was the screenshot
01:42:23 And I thought from this that you would be playing as like that it would be like a side scrolling
01:42:30 Action adventure or beat them up where maybe you would like control like a squad of mice
01:42:36 And you're like their mother or something and you're like commanding them to like fight for you
01:42:41 Uh, that's this was wrong. This was not the kind of game. It was at all. It was actually a 3d
01:42:48 um, I don't even know like a horde
01:42:52 Based like first person
01:42:55 shooter
01:42:57 Basically you play mother of many
01:42:59 And you start the game and when you get to the actual game part of it
01:43:02 you're in an arena and zombies just zombie mice just start like
01:43:07 encroaching into the arena from the sides and you have your little scythe that shoots beams
01:43:14 and you have to
01:43:15 You know, you just have to fight back the hordes
01:43:18 And you know, they come like faster and faster and more and more and bigger and stronger of them
01:43:23 And you know, you get experience points from the ones you kill and as you get as you level up
01:43:28 you get to choose this sort of like a roguelike element to it where like
01:43:32 You know, you're choosing which upgrades to get and that that changes your play style a little bit
01:43:37 And basically the the goal is just like, you know survive 15 minutes of
01:43:43 fighting this horde off and it's fine
01:43:46 The gameplay is a little shallow
01:43:48 Uh
01:43:49 Aesthetically, I guess it looked pretty good
01:43:51 It has like an it's you know, the like eastern european
01:43:55 depression simulator
01:43:57 They look cool in this screenshot. There's only there's only one actual mouse
01:44:01 There's only one actual mouse in the game and it's uh, this one
01:44:06 Yeah, it's frankly. There's not enough mice
01:44:09 But she's the mother of many, right? No
01:44:12 She is not the mother of many. She is your sister
01:44:17 And sister of one
01:44:20 I'm not I'm not clear on if the mother of many is like your mom
01:44:26 Or like the goddess of the woods
01:44:29 I think it's both
01:44:31 Anyway, the point is you're bringing your sister out to this like
01:44:35 secret place in the woods to
01:44:37 To kill her and sacrifice her so that her blood will nourish the land and like your crops will grow
01:44:43 And uh, and when you try and cut and cut her, uh, she gets possessed by the mother of many and like summons all these demons
01:44:50 You got to fight the demons
01:44:53 And it's good
01:44:56 Yeah, I'm I'm I'm just noticing on your thing. There's like
01:45:01 Translated versions at the bottom
01:45:04 What?
01:45:05 Like
01:45:05 Yeah, it says program available in other language. I think they just translate the page
01:45:10 Not the game itself
01:45:12 I'm curious if you can tell like if it's been downloaded from another country. Wait a minute
01:45:19 Like on your soft tonic page like at the bottom it's like oh phantom's revenge Korean Italian
01:45:25 It's it says in in the details list that it's like oh, yeah on the Spanish page. It says that the game is in English
01:45:33 So I'm it would be so fucked up if like they had actually like gone into the code and translated the
01:45:38 The game into no no, I wouldn't expect that would be amazing sort of like I'm I'm interested because it doesn't say
01:45:45 On those different pages the number of downloads
01:45:49 But does that mean that if somebody from from korea did download it it would say one
01:45:55 I
01:45:57 think it's probably
01:45:59 quite likely
01:46:01 that
01:46:01 Nobody has downloaded this game from the
01:46:05 Italian
01:46:07 A web web version of the web page
01:46:10 I would be funny though. It'd be so funny
01:46:14 Yeah, because because this
01:46:16 hypothetically is like
01:46:18 Exposing you to so many different markets. Yes that you would never have I'm I'm I'm truly am mr. Worldwide
01:46:25 Hey
01:46:27 Oh, there's a polish page
01:46:29 Ah, no downloads
01:46:33 Oh, Netherlands
01:46:36 Ah, no downloads
01:46:41 It's just so funny seeing like
01:46:43 In in the midst of uh different language texts the things that are state english are like my little pony tonic the headshot
01:46:50 Strong youtuber
01:46:53 Yeah, what is this? This is great. It's the japanese page
01:47:00 Uh
01:47:02 Katana's wayende pony
01:47:05 What and it's never
01:47:09 Oh in in mezlim door drink there in katana's wayende pony meet an attitude
01:47:16 Ha ha ha
01:47:19 Pony with an attitude a katana wielding pony with an attitude. I'm pretty sure is this exactly what the english version says
01:47:26 Oh, yeah
01:47:29 Like what is the a vietnamese?
01:47:32 Sure. Why not a pony a pony slasher with a story
01:47:37 Well, I didn't know vietnamese
01:47:39 looked like that
01:47:41 It's like mostly arabic characters not arabic. Um, I'm thinking of arabic numbers. Um
01:47:48 Like what are these characters called? They're not the they're not like diacritics
01:47:53 You're talking about the ones with the weird like symbols above the letters
01:47:58 No, is there a way to to like
01:48:01 Categorize like types of
01:48:04 text
01:48:05 What like in in asian languages they have like symbols like this but a lot of
01:48:11 European languages share letters like abc
01:48:15 Uh
01:48:16 Vietnamese apparently has like stuff that looks more western
01:48:21 Uh
01:48:26 I mean i'm looking at what I think is the vietnamese page and it looks like all the letters are yeah
01:48:32 Basically, you know arabic not arabic. Um, yeah, yeah, I thought that's what i'm thinking. What's the word for that describing that?
01:48:42 Did they did did vietnam just like not have their own like written
01:48:47 language until they
01:48:49 Or maybe they didn't have like an alphabetical language. Maybe they only had like a pictographic language
01:48:54 I don't know. I don't know
01:48:57 Yeah, weird weird that they have
01:49:00 This this is their written
01:49:05 System what's up with that
01:49:08 What's up with that
01:49:10 What's up with that? I mean, I don't know that it's vietnamese. It just has the thing vi
01:49:16 Next to it. I mean, it says what else could that be? It's yeah
01:49:20 What else what else could could it possibly be? I can't think of anything
01:49:25 Okay, french colonial rule of vietnam led to the official adoption of the vietnamese alphabet
01:49:30 Which is based on latin latin script. That's what i was thinking of there we go
01:49:35 Interesting so french are the reason for that
01:49:41 Now we know they strike again
01:49:46 Um, I have let me see have I gotten through my entire list yet?
01:49:56 Mmm illness mother of many anime bracket bonds
01:50:01 Website down the last thing I want to say this week is that my my website is down
01:50:06 Did you hear about this by any chance?
01:50:08 Uh, yeah, yeah, uh jesse dmca
01:50:14 dmca reported uh saint comics dot com for hosting the plebe and the weave
01:50:20 Uh, uh blu-ray vials
01:50:24 Lemau
01:50:26 Yeah, yeah, I just I just I just have to say I just have to say how funny I think it is
01:50:33 that rather than
01:50:35 rather than
01:50:37 make the blu-rays
01:50:39 or
01:50:40 Let me give him money to let me sell them. He has elected instead to pay a lawyer to uh
01:50:49 He's paid paid money to bury them pay money to to prevent them from seeing the light of day
01:50:54 Uh
01:50:56 I know I did you are you aware that I offered him a cut that I said just let me let me give you a cut of sales
01:51:02 And and let me keep selling and he said no
01:51:04 Uh
01:51:06 I wasn't aware of that exchange. I guess it was in dm. So it was it was in dms
01:51:11 It was in dms that would have been like a maybe a month ago or maybe two something like that
01:51:17 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean well, uh, so
01:51:24 Yeah, he hired a guy
01:51:27 He hired a guy who does dmca takedowns for 50 bucks a pop
01:51:31 I I looked into the uh, I got I got a letter and I looked into who sent it and it was this this one guy
01:51:37 And I looked at his website and I was like, hmm interesting
01:51:40 uh, so
01:51:42 the website my website's down
01:51:45 I just need a new host which is
01:51:48 Actually the way the way it worked out
01:51:50 is is like
01:51:52 It's kind of good that something happened to make me switch hosts because my old hosting was on like
01:51:58 I had I had picked a really bad plan
01:52:01 The plan I had picked was like month to month and I was paying like $14 a month to host my site
01:52:07 Uh, you know, I switched hosts. That's that is quite a lot. It was quite a lot. It was I
01:52:13 It was not a good I I screwed I screwed up
01:52:17 So I have picked the new plan that I've got I've locked in a rate. It's gonna be like
01:52:23 It's gonna be like $3.99 a month for a while and then it'll go up to like $8.99
01:52:31 In like a year or two
01:52:33 so
01:52:34 That's fine. The website's down for the moment. It'll be back up in I don't know a week or two
01:52:40 Probably not even that long
01:52:42 so whatever
01:52:43 No, no biggie. No problem. And you know, I gotta say
01:52:49 I did
01:52:51 I never really intended to leave the plebeian the weeb stuff up on my store page forever
01:52:56 You know, it's not like
01:52:58 You know, it's not really germane to the content of my personal website
01:53:03 Yeah
01:53:04 So so what I mean, you did also say that nobody was buying it anymore
01:53:09 Oh, yeah, I mean
01:53:11 A couple people bought them like the last minute when I said I was almost out
01:53:16 Uh, so my my you know, I had I had a couple copies left. I said guys I'm almost out
01:53:20 You know a handful more people bought them and now I'm out and so it's all good
01:53:25 the
01:53:26 the
01:53:28 you know
01:53:29 but you know
01:53:32 I just
01:53:33 After after that
01:53:35 When I said, okay, they're free now
01:53:37 If they're free to download now, it's it's so it was no longer about the money. It was no longer about selling them or making money
01:53:44 Uh, uh, and it's I don't know. Don't you think it's weird?
01:53:47 Don't you think it's weird and wacky that like the dmca takedown didn't come until like
01:53:54 After I'd already said I'm not selling them anymore. They're free now
01:53:59 Don't you think that's weird and wild and wacky and wonderful? I don't know. I mean
01:54:07 Is it is it not
01:54:09 could you
01:54:10 I'm trying to think if there's like a reason a dmca has to be against something digital
01:54:15 Because you're hosting a digital file as opposed to
01:54:18 Having a store where you can buy something and maybe that's different
01:54:23 uh
01:54:24 What do you mean?
01:54:26 Uh, well, I don't know like like a dmca against your site
01:54:31 Would not prevent you from having physical stock that you could mail to people who dm you on anywhere
01:54:37 No, but a file hosting
01:54:39 You can you can you can block that from existing
01:54:44 Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I mean maybe there's a difference in in something like that. I mean
01:54:49 You know, I don't know all I'm saying is um
01:54:55 I guess I I just I just really feel
01:54:59 That jesse's whole attitude about this thing
01:55:02 is completely irrational and and very stupid and and wrong-headed and like
01:55:08 He seems to have felt from the very beginning
01:55:11 that I am
01:55:12 stealing from him
01:55:14 and and uh
01:55:16 victimizing him
01:55:18 and
01:55:19 I don't know. I just I just think that if you take a step back and look at it
01:55:23 Like the the fact that this is happening now after this stuff was already free
01:55:28 I'm just I'm not even selling them anymore. I'm just offering it for free
01:55:32 I literally just did I did his job for him and I made the blu rays and I
01:55:36 Completed that work for him and I said anyone can have them and it's free now. Don't worry about it
01:55:40 And then he gets lawyers involved and then he sends his dmc a takedown takes my website down
01:55:45 it just I don't know it just really kind of uh
01:55:48 just really kind of uh
01:55:50 Highlights that like
01:55:51 There really was no need for any of this
01:55:54 You really could have just been normal about it and not been a little a little little baby bitch about it
01:56:00 and just and just not uh fucking
01:56:02 Just don't be such a spaz. I don't know. He's been a real spaz about it the whole time. That's that's my opinion
01:56:09 um
01:56:10 and uh, you know
01:56:12 Sorry
01:56:14 Uh
01:56:15 Just there's no point. There's no there's no actual harm being done and I don't really think there ever has been
01:56:21 Uh, and that's my line and uh, we'll never uh, I will never recant it
01:56:26 That's what I have felt all along and I continue to feel that way
01:56:30 Uh, but oh well, you know, I guess none of that matters in the face of 50 dollars
01:56:37 Given to a guy to send a letter to uh to a web host
01:56:45 I don't know what else to say about it
01:56:48 I don't like it
01:56:50 um
01:56:52 Anyway, that's anyway, that's why my website's down
01:56:55 I I know I know, you know, I know my site is like a huge a hugely popular
01:57:00 buzzing hive of activity
01:57:02 I know it's a thousand people a day are like are checking it to read
01:57:07 Beescapades to get caught up on Beescapades so that when the next chapter drops and the perfect comic party
01:57:12 They'll be caught up. I don't know what's going on and a thousand people a day are like, where's where's the website?
01:57:18 I can't read Beescapades. I can't read. I can't
01:57:21 Read slime and punishment to understand the context behind phantom's revenge
01:57:26 And I just want you to know that I'm I'm with you and I'm working on it
01:57:31 And um, the problems will all be solved soon. We will put all this silliness behind us
01:57:41 Okay, that's all I have to say okay, okay
01:57:46 Sorry, I was just looking at my currently operational website and I was just
01:57:51 No, don't look at that
01:57:53 I was looking at my links that I have to from my Clarissa to buy the Clarissa book
01:57:57 I'm like, I can't wait can't wait to add a new link
01:58:01 Well, I guess it'll be the same link, but I guess it'll send the link to like the the page of Clarissa volumes rather than the single one
01:58:11 I think um, I think it'll be like, ah, what if you want to buy one of one of the series?
01:58:17 I think give and take dot site
01:58:20 represents a um
01:58:23 I think I think it's uh
01:58:25 I think it's violating my copyright
01:58:28 I think I think it represents a uh, a uh
01:58:32 You know a a functional market replacement for st comics.com. I think it's uh,
01:58:38 Yeah, pretty much. It's not it's not transformative enough
01:58:42 So I'm what do you mean? I'm gonna have where it's been saying I'm gonna have point point to Ben saying I'm gonna have to take it down
01:58:47 I'm sorry. It's over
01:58:49 Well, it's it's well, they're both because because you know when people see
01:58:54 St comics is down they say well now
01:58:57 What now I gotta go I guess I have to I guess I have to go read
01:59:01 Yeah, I guess I have to go read closer gun smoke instead and then their lust is is slaked and then they
01:59:06 They'll never read
01:59:08 Vapors chapter three. I'm gonna I'm gonna release a new comic called the voopers
01:59:13 No, you wouldn't dare
01:59:15 It's about two teenagers
01:59:18 Um, mints and vagda. Oh, I can't do that. I can't do that one. Yeah, you can. Yeah, go. No, no, no
01:59:24 Don't be a coward go for it. Vagda. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
01:59:28 Vagda is the boy. Okay. They're both trans. Okay
01:59:31 fine
01:59:33 Fine if you must
01:59:35 Oh, so papers is well now. Okay losers. They're so
01:59:38 Confident and they don't have any social problems at all. That's
01:59:42 That's awesome. That's that sounds so cool
01:59:48 The voopers I'm gonna ah and then they say I'm gonna go boop. You want to go boop? Yeah
01:59:55 They're best friends. Well
01:59:58 Now they're better friends
02:00:01 Well, shit
02:00:02 Yeah, you can do that if you want
02:00:04 Unless I beat you to it
02:00:07 And then my second comic will be called the loser and they never win a fight
02:00:13 Hey, so in the green night
02:00:16 Is um, is this is this the game?
02:00:19 Uh, yeah, basically. No, no the christmas game is about getting you
02:00:25 getting
02:00:26 I you punch me. I punch you
02:00:29 It's a weird game. I don't why I don't know why it's called the christmas game
02:00:33 So the so the christmas game
02:00:35 The green night says chop my body
02:00:37 And then a year from now next night and he says you have to try and nick me
02:00:41 Is it like is it like sounds like he's gonna be dodging around is it like saint nick?
02:00:47 Like saint nick nick me. Hmm. And then next is it is the idea that then next christmas. I'll come and nick you
02:00:55 Is it like trick or treat like yeah, you you you trick me by slicing my wood off
02:01:01 And then tomorrow. I mean next year. I'll come and treat you to a gouging wound in your body
02:01:07 Uh, yeah, something like that interesting
02:01:12 fascinating
02:01:14 Concerning looking into it. It's a I think it's the they just call it the christmas game probably just because the original story has it during christ's mass
02:01:23 Uh, and it's not to do with like tradition like not traditional but like um more modern
02:01:29 Understandings of holiday season stuff. It could just be like a pagan thing
02:01:34 Well, no, it wouldn't be a pagan thing because it's christmas. They call it the christmas game
02:01:39 Maybe it was a pagan thing. They changed it in the film to be the christmas game because people know what that is
02:01:49 Who cares?
02:01:51 No, it would have been
02:01:53 Because isn't gaue and like one of the knights of the round
02:01:57 So they so they would have been christian
02:02:00 Right, okay. Yeah, I don't know the history. It probably it probably has some pagan origin though
02:02:08 No, I mean
02:02:10 I mean a lot of christian stuff does
02:02:13 It does I don't know when christmas got taken over or the pagan holiday
02:02:18 Of like the wincest sources got taken over by christians
02:02:23 um
02:02:24 Because when christians came and wokeified it
02:02:27 They they they they christified it
02:02:31 um, they christified
02:02:33 um
02:02:36 like
02:02:37 Because jesus wasn't born on december
02:02:42 But like when was that like changed? Um
02:02:47 Oh gee, I just don't know my history golly golly g
02:02:50 Oh
02:02:52 Gee whiz, I guess we'll just never know. I guess only the lord may know such secrets
02:03:00 Gee whiz we jizz
02:03:04 That's true. That's what they said. That's really true
02:03:09 Lamal, um
02:03:12 Oh god, I didn't read the new one piece yet
02:03:16 Oh, is there
02:03:19 It is to 1081 is the new one this week. I think I think I did read that. I forgot to mention it to you. Shit
02:03:27 Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
02:03:31 I heard it's good
02:03:35 Did we talk about garp in the last one when he does the big punch on the galaxy first? Yeah. Yeah
02:03:42 Yeah, I think we did talk about that. All right
02:03:45 Well, I guess we're doing one piece now. I guess we're doing one piece now
02:03:50 Should I just read it real quick?
02:03:52 Yeah, read it real quick. Um, but I want to immediately draw your attention
02:03:57 to
02:03:58 the
02:04:00 Image at the front of the chapter where sanji is reading a book about caulking. Oh, yeah
02:04:05 Ah, he just didn't uh, I just didn't complete the uh, I just didn't complete the uh the oh
02:04:11 No
02:04:12 But then it would be cooking without the sea
02:04:15 What?
02:04:17 Oh, wait, no cooking doesn't have a sea
02:04:21 I thought he missed out an oh whoops
02:04:24 It is cocking. It is looks like i'm the one who doesn't know english
02:04:29 All right, all right, i'm reading i'm reading
02:04:35 Man
02:04:37 I like scuffed piece
02:04:40 I was i'm going back uh doing I think I I don't I don't remember if I mentioned the one piece book club reading volumes
02:04:49 from
02:04:50 previous
02:04:51 Reading all the volumes from the beginning with a new group people. Yes, I heard about that
02:04:57 and um
02:04:59 scuffed piece kind of was all always there
02:05:02 It's just that there's
02:05:04 Because like I look at the drawings and I'm like, oh, you know what?
02:05:08 You can really tell that this was hand drawn with a like it wasn't I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but like that's just manga
02:05:15 Most manga is pretty scuffed if you stop and you like look at every individual panel
02:05:21 Uh, yes
02:05:23 except for like except for like death note
02:05:27 Or or like berserk, right?
02:05:30 Like some of them aren't but
02:05:32 Most manga
02:05:34 you
02:05:36 It's drawn with the idea that you look at any given panel for like a quarter of a second
02:05:41 It literally like doesn't need to look good
02:05:46 And yet it's so good and yet it's so good and yet it's so good
02:05:51 Okay, i'm reading a few moments later. All right. I'm done
02:05:57 so
02:05:59 All right, looks like blackbeard did not get the ope ope fruit
02:06:04 But just like I thought yeah, he he wants he wants its power for eternal life
02:06:10 Uh, but he would not he would not be able to do that if he stole the power for himself
02:06:16 I guess he would he would have to give it to one of his subordinates
02:06:20 Which I think he could do
02:06:23 I think what he could do is like have like
02:06:27 Like a slave do it like you capture someone forces them to have the fruit and then tells them to use it on him like that
02:06:34 Yeah, yeah
02:06:37 Uh, so if he could capture law he might be able to I don't think he'd be able to do that because law would die
02:06:42 But what does he mean about he says the hundred hearts of people that law stole
02:06:49 Yeah, I I think this has been explained like mentioned a long time ago law
02:06:56 Does that thing where he uses his power to take someone's heart away? He had Caesar's heart for a long time
02:07:02 That was a bargaining chip. Mm-hmm
02:07:04 um
02:07:05 and I think he did that to
02:07:08 Like yeah, a hundred people a rocky part, but I forget where rocky part is or when that happened. Yeah, I don't uh
02:07:16 I don't even remember that at all
02:07:19 Maybe it's maybe it's a new thing. Maybe it's not an old thing that's being referenced, but I think it is an old thing
02:07:25 uh, I mean, but the point is uh
02:07:30 All those people are pirate island, which is blackbeard's island
02:07:34 So I guess law made a lot of enemies and blackbeard made friends with those enemies
02:07:39 If I bring your something
02:07:41 We're all living in fear on pirate. Yeah, I guess so
02:07:46 uh
02:07:48 this
02:07:50 This chapter makes blackbeard seem kind of cool
02:07:53 Oh, yeah, it's it's the funny thing with blackbeard. He's not like a dumb
02:07:58 I'm evil and I want to destroy sort of villain. He's
02:08:03 been
02:08:04 sort of set up as like
02:08:07 A an inversion not an inversion of luffy, but like a different interpretation of the freedom of piracy. Yeah, he's all about freedom
02:08:16 and
02:08:17 but he's
02:08:18 you know
02:08:19 Freedom freedom freedom for himself freedom at the cost of others
02:08:24 At the cost of others luffy's is all about freedom
02:08:27 Uh for himself. Yeah
02:08:30 But also for everyone
02:08:33 For everyone. Yeah
02:08:35 Like he likes sharing freedoms. Yeah blackbeard is like cynical. He doesn't believe luffy sees someone being oppressed
02:08:41 He'll he'll do something to stop it, but blackbeard will be like how can I turn this to my advantage?
02:08:48 Yes, yeah
02:08:50 Uh, so in a way he's a good he's a good um
02:08:55 Smart and thematically
02:08:58 Uh relevant antagonist. Yeah, it's the main villain kind of kind of the main villain
02:09:03 I mean, yeah, see see in them all just like hang out in the bar with kuzan
02:09:07 They're all just like, uh, you know, they're all just vibing. They're all just uh, just bantering
02:09:12 Yeah, they're like, oh, you hate the marines too at that ike acai, you know that piece of shit
02:09:16 Yeah, it's like maybe if if you weren't enemies with these guys, they might be kind of cool to just hang out with
02:09:22 I don't know
02:09:23 I mean when blackbeard when they when you meet blackbeard at
02:09:27 Chaya, he's just sitting there cherry pie
02:09:31 Yeah, yeah
02:09:33 And I I always liked
02:09:36 That luffy hates cherry pie
02:09:38 And blackbeard loves it and that's what they fight over rather than anything else. Yeah
02:09:43 They're like
02:09:44 Yeah, they're they're they're kind of similar
02:09:48 Uh, but
02:09:50 they just
02:09:51 Fundamental disagreement fundamental disagreement on the method. Yeah
02:09:56 Why would luffy hate cherry pie?
02:09:59 Yeah, I know it's such an odd little thing. I also don't he loves I also don't really care for cherry pie
02:10:05 low tier pie
02:10:08 Uh
02:10:09 Yeah, he just he rather yeah, this is
02:10:12 Oh, so okay, so kuzan's missing a leg now from the battle with uh
02:10:17 Okay, you know this is interesting doesn't doesn't affect him at all
02:10:21 Doesn't even bother him, but uh, he just makes a I mean
02:10:25 Prospero also had that like he lost an arm
02:10:29 From pedro and then he turned his arm into a candy arm. Who's who still has an arm. Who's prospero?
02:10:36 the big uh, the number one
02:10:40 Son the first son of big mom the big tongue guy
02:10:44 Oh
02:10:47 Oh the candy man. He literally makes candy
02:10:50 Yeah, this is devil fruit. Um, I'm having trouble picturing him. Let me just google him real fast
02:10:57 Oh pero sparrow pero sparrow. Oh, yeah
02:11:02 Yeah, this wow this guy left like no impression on me whatsoever
02:11:06 Okay, he yeah big tongue sure
02:11:11 Sure, whatever
02:11:14 Yeah, but that's not even his real tongue. That's probably a candy tongue
02:11:17 No, of course, this is real time. He's been he loves licking
02:11:22 Candy well
02:11:25 pooms among us
02:11:27 um
02:11:28 All right, so yeah, there's a few things starting off. Yes
02:11:32 um garb lands with the ship
02:11:35 And he's like, uh, fuck. I'm old and you know, wow
02:11:40 He's so strong
02:11:42 He's so strong and yet he's not as strong as he was. I like that trope. I enjoy that one
02:11:49 Um, and then the the cute girl with the gun gets turned to ice
02:11:55 by by alki g
02:11:58 Yes, unfortunate. This is very unfortunate
02:12:02 And alki g is one of the black bed pirates who is here rather than at uh, we presume egghead
02:12:09 on the ship
02:12:12 Uh, yeah, he says teaches away
02:12:15 So so maybe teach it so maybe so maybe that means teaches at egghead
02:12:19 Yeah, so yeah, that's what I'm thinking. So the teach blackbeard and some other people who haven't we haven't seen
02:12:27 are
02:12:28 on the ship and alki g is not
02:12:30 he's here
02:12:32 and
02:12:34 The whole thing with him joining the blackbeard parts. We were wondering about this
02:12:37 I've been wondering about this for a long time like why would you do that?
02:12:42 Obviously the fight with the the alki g and leaving the marines
02:12:48 Seemed they say it's like over the fleet admiral position
02:12:51 I guess that's been said before
02:12:54 But I feel like it was probably more than just that like I want the promotion
02:12:58 No, I want it and then they fight like that that seems a bit insane. I it seemed like
02:13:04 Uh, I mean it seems like just the the the hierarchy was just kind of in chaos at the time and so
02:13:13 like one of them will probably get it
02:13:17 And
02:13:18 I'm sure it wasn't like an official like whoever wins the fight gets it. It's more just like
02:13:23 All right, we but we don't like each other
02:13:25 We don't want the other guy to become the new fleet admiral
02:13:29 There's nothing to do but just fight about it and like fuck the guy who loses
02:13:34 Uh, uh, yeah, I don't I don't know what to think of alki g because like
02:13:39 Like I said last time
02:13:42 I don't think he's dumb. He doesn't seem like a
02:13:46 Like a hard on his sleeve kind of person. No
02:13:49 That thinks uh after he does stuff
02:13:53 No, but the way he's characterized here is that
02:13:56 You know, he got into a a fight with the other admiral over
02:14:02 Like a position in the military
02:14:04 and then he joins blackbeard's crew
02:14:07 on the
02:14:09 you know
02:14:10 for for like
02:14:11 presumably the protection and the freedom that piracy
02:14:15 allows
02:14:17 Yeah, I don't and I'm like that that that makes sense enough, but then
02:14:21 Well, I guess it just I guess it just does make sense. It just sort of is sad to see him
02:14:26 Do things well that it seems to make to make him look like a villain like turning somebody to ice instantly
02:14:33 Okay, I know he's trying to protect. I mean turn it's turning people to ice like he can turn him back. It's fine
02:14:38 I know for reasons I
02:14:40 Blackbeard says like, uh, you know, we all we all we all profit because uh
02:14:47 Yeah, we all okay the the the
02:14:49 The the you know pirates all wrong. We ain't just a merry band of chums bumming around
02:14:54 We all profit from having our own agendas. That's what makes us pirates
02:14:57 Yes, and the the the vis translation that I just read is different
02:15:01 It says have you got the wrong idea about pirates? Nobody said we're all best friends here
02:15:06 The only thing pirates need is an alignment of interests
02:15:10 Which is you know, it's similar
02:15:12 So, you know, I love this face by the way. There's something so satisfying about this face
02:15:17 Oh, yeah, I posted teach teach his good face good. He's he's a he's a great design. I love his nose and his
02:15:25 face so like he's so his giant face is like so threatening
02:15:30 He's right up in there
02:15:33 So
02:15:34 I mean you're a free man do what you want. So I mean Cousin is
02:15:39 I guess he must see aligning himself with these guys
02:15:43 as useful
02:15:45 to some
02:15:46 end
02:15:48 Yeah, I don't I don't exactly know what his end his goal is right now
02:15:53 But I think well, I'm pretty sure that whatever his goal was
02:15:58 um
02:15:59 Or continues to be is very much involved with the reason that he got into such a catastrophic fight with alkiji
02:16:06 back. I knew I mean
02:16:09 over
02:16:10 Fleet admiral position because like he doesn't seem like he would give a shit about something about being fleet admiral
02:16:16 Yeah, I think either because he believes that um akainu would be a terrible problem
02:16:22 Or I think he that's probably yeah, I think he probably yeah, if my read on him is correct. I think he just wouldn't want
02:16:30 Akainu
02:16:31 To do it. He just wouldn't want him in charge. I don't think I don't think Cousin is the kind of guy who's like
02:16:37 I've got to be freaking king or whatever
02:16:40 Yeah
02:16:42 So I so I think it's like biting his time. I could see how joining the blackbeard pirates might help him in the goal of
02:16:48 Yeah, eventually taking down akainu. That makes sense
02:16:53 Yes, but and then there's the bit where garp he's fighting with garp
02:16:58 And he says your number one protege versus your new favorite. So new favorite meaning kobi
02:17:05 and uh
02:17:06 That implies that uh cousin was the old favorite of garp
02:17:12 Meaning that garp probably also saw goodness in kuzan. Yeah
02:17:19 And I wonder if kuzan is throwing this fight deliberately
02:17:25 Because obviously he has to look like he's defending stuff
02:17:29 Yes, I see because he
02:17:32 garp says he's hesitating or wavering
02:17:35 And yeah
02:17:38 Yeah, and he's sort of letting himself lose to garp and it's not it's not a bad story like garp is such a legend
02:17:44 Yeah, it would happen. Yeah
02:17:47 That's that's true, but I wonder if I wonder if kuzan could have beaten him or at least really tried harder than this
02:17:55 I
02:17:58 Well, he he freezes uh, he freezes him right he freezes garp, but it just like doesn't work
02:18:04 Did I yeah, he just he just breaks out of it or something. Yeah, super hacky super malio
02:18:14 Wavering is a sign of weakness wait
02:18:18 Yeah, okay, I says don't be would you kill your senior apprentice's favorite protege?
02:18:23 Don't be tight and then garp says don't be tied down by this nonsense. I taught you to live in the moment
02:18:28 It's not working on him. Listen up kuzan wavering is a sign
02:18:32 All right, he breaks out of the ice then he
02:18:34 Kicks his kicks his little ass
02:18:36 Throws him into the blue throws him into the blue hole
02:18:40 It's like a black hole, but it's blue because he's a
02:18:43 cop
02:18:44 Yeah, this is a thin the thin blue hole
02:18:51 Um
02:18:52 I think yeah, I think you might be right that he might have uh, he might just kind of be putting on appearances for this fight
02:18:59 It's so funny how black beard
02:19:03 You know, I've been playing uh
02:19:05 Battle network mega man
02:19:07 And it's funny every now and then
02:19:09 Your rival shows up
02:19:12 And your your rival chowd has proto man is his navi
02:19:16 And he's all and occasionally he'll say something like this. He'll be like
02:19:20 Proto man will be like
02:19:21 Me and chowd aren't friends like we're just we're we're just i'm just his now
02:19:25 I dutifully serve him as his program
02:19:28 Uh, and mega man will be like but me and lan we're best friends and and brothers and and our d we share our dna
02:19:35 And we love each other in a platonic way
02:19:39 And proto man will be like, hmm, that's gay bro and chowd will be like, yeah, it's totally gay
02:19:44 I don't think proto man's hot at all and proto be like, yeah, I don't think chowd's hot either
02:19:48 Also, he's like 11 years old. So it's weird to even talk like that. Okay. Bye
02:19:53 Um
02:19:57 Insisting like yeah, we're
02:19:59 Yeah
02:20:00 Me and my co-workers. Yeah, we're not friends. We're just here to get our shit done and make a ton of money
02:20:07 It's like I get it. I get it
02:20:10 I get it
02:20:12 Is a little sad
02:20:14 Is a little sad to be like, yeah, I pretty much hang out with these guys 24 7
02:20:19 We hang out on a on a on a on a ship together
02:20:22 Maybe that's true. Maybe that's not true. Maybe maybe they're not always on a ship together
02:20:25 I guess they have a whole island now. They probably don't even have to hang out together unless they really want to
02:20:31 Well, I I mean the blackbird pirates seem like chummy. I don't think they seem like cold
02:20:37 They can have a beer and they can have a laugh. Yeah, and they can enjoy a victory together, but like ultimately
02:20:45 They're in it. Yeah, not for friendship. They're in it for power. Yeah
02:20:50 Yeah, but they can get power by being together. So it's just it's a kind of
02:20:56 You know, it's not unemotional. Oh, that's what the pcp was supposed to be
02:21:02 Yeah, we were we were supposed to kill the government and and uh
02:21:08 And yet it's still there the government and he's not moved hasn't moved an inch
02:21:13 And now they've elected the real life version of acai new joe biden and there's nothing we can do about it
02:21:19 We were supposed we were supposed to stop this
02:21:23 He's got his magma powers
02:21:25 Yeah
02:21:27 Uh joe
02:21:28 Ah joe
02:21:30 It's joe over. It is joe over
02:21:32 Uh, um
02:21:35 Let's see. Okay. What else to
02:21:38 Well, the next thing in the chapter is that we see that I predicted and it's pretty obvious, but I predicted law
02:21:45 Oh, yeah defeated. Yes defeated. Just like kid. Yeah, just like kid
02:21:51 Damn black beard is defeated law
02:21:56 On winner island, I don't know if that was the name of the island they were at before
02:21:59 I guess it must have been because if it was the it was if it was like
02:22:04 the one depicted before
02:22:06 Where like law was
02:22:08 Briefly turned into a woman for that one panel
02:22:12 Good times. Do you remember that? I vaguely remember that. Yeah
02:22:15 Yeah, it's a little little like haha. We're fighting and this is the result. Was he turned into a woman by
02:22:22 Docky cue with his oh trans disease
02:22:27 I was thinking it was who's the is it Ivanovic is the one that can turn you into a woman
02:22:33 Ivankov Ivankov Ivankov, right
02:22:36 Yeah, Ivankov. Yeah
02:22:39 Fucking doc cue doc cue has freaky hormone fruit. Is that really what it is?
02:22:45 Yeah, the hormone hilarious doc doc cue has like
02:22:49 weaponized like estrogen bullets
02:22:52 Amazing. Yeah, and they say oh, it's only temporary. It's just a freak. I'm out a little just to make a little
02:22:59 Just to make of all weird and shit
02:23:02 So that we can gain me up a hand it was like
02:23:04 It worked shut up. You just wanted to draw a law as a girl. Wait. Yeah, wait a minute. Wait a minute
02:23:10 well
02:23:12 Would that have happened like a long time ago?
02:23:16 Because I mean doc wait
02:23:19 If doc cue shot law
02:23:22 Then I mean was was is that the same encounter that led to his
02:23:27 submarine being destroyed
02:23:29 I mean, I'm assuming that I can't remember. I don't think there's enough landmarks in these panels to determine
02:23:36 Whether it's the same island
02:23:38 Um, all I know is they were fighting. We didn't see the resolution of that fight
02:23:42 And here is a resolution of a fight between black bear and law. I think it makes sense that it's the same thing
02:23:47 Yeah, yeah, meaning this would have happened a little while ago, but not that long ago. I mean if if he was already
02:23:54 getting shot by doc cue I have to imagine that that
02:23:59 was
02:24:00 I don't remember if it was a bullet. It may have been like a gas or something
02:24:03 Okay, but they were because he was fighting a bunch of the crew was like but doc doc cue was there and they were having a battle
02:24:08 So, I mean, yeah, yeah
02:24:11 Blackbeard must have showed up later
02:24:14 No, blackbeard was there during oh, okay, so
02:24:17 So this is so this is they were they were in the throes of a of a fight. It was just we didn't see what happened
02:24:22 Okay, so this is what happened
02:24:24 Okay, so the law got beat
02:24:27 And uh, we we saw earlier that blackbeard knows of the road poneglas
02:24:33 And big mom kaito have won each law has those ones
02:24:39 so now blackbeard and shanks both have
02:24:42 kaitos and big moms a road poneglas
02:24:46 um, but then
02:24:48 There's two more they don't know about one of them. We do know about it's the one inside zoe the giant
02:24:54 Yes, uh, the giant
02:24:57 What is it? It's a it's a elephant tree in the shape of a whale
02:25:01 What on top of it? Yeah, that's the location. There's like the the mink tribe settlement. There's a big tree that looks like a whale
02:25:09 Uh, did I hallucinate that?
02:25:13 Are you know what a tree?
02:25:15 Okay, a tree that looks like a whale. I can't zow is not the elephant
02:25:19 The elephant is could is kashina kashina is the elephant and it has a tree in the shape of a whale on it
02:25:25 And that's zow and that's where the the poneglyph is no zoe
02:25:29 Zoe is wait zoe is the the island on the top of the elephant called kashina. Okay
02:25:35 And then on in so on zoe there is a tree shape like a whale
02:25:44 And in that tree there is a poneglyph
02:25:46 Is it kashina? I'm typing kashina and it's sanguina and I'm like no
02:25:51 There's a glyph in the tree and a tree in the shape of a whale and a whale on the zoe and zoe on an elephant
02:25:58 It's it's zunesh. Okay. Not kushina. Okay. Sure. Whatever
02:26:02 Zunesh, uh, da da da da
02:26:04 One da da da zoe on its back zoe is the island
02:26:07 and
02:26:09 Uh, da da da da da
02:26:11 Where is the thing?
02:26:13 Layout and locations whale forest. That's what it was called
02:26:18 Um
02:26:20 No images
02:26:21 You're fucking me. You're killing me over here. I just want to show ben the whale. Please
02:26:27 I want to see the whale tree
02:26:31 Whale tree
02:26:33 Okay, here is an image of I think I guess it's not a tree. No, it is a tree
02:26:39 It's got it's got leaves coming out of it. Huh
02:26:42 Well
02:26:44 Okay, so that's inside that is a secret compartment where rhizo was hiding
02:26:49 And where the road ponyglyph is
02:26:52 Okay, and so and we don't know where the fourth one is right?
02:26:57 No, the fourth one is hypothesized by the blackbird pirates
02:27:00 It heard rumors that the man marked by flames has it
02:27:05 Who is a mystery man? I can't think of who it could be
02:27:09 Man marked by flames means burnt. I guess I mean
02:27:13 Man marked by flames
02:27:17 It's I mean the only one I can think of
02:27:19 Is luffy because he's got the scar from his on his chest from the from the magma punch
02:27:27 Uh
02:27:30 I guess you could you could say that but I mean he doesn't yeah, yeah
02:27:35 Obviously not who they're talking about they're talking about a mystery man that travels in a black ship
02:27:39 Yeah, um that creates whirlpools around it
02:27:42 Um the man marked by this is the first time we're hearing about that, right?
02:27:47 I think so. Okay. Um
02:27:49 The man might play flames
02:27:50 I had at first thought was like fisher tiger because marked by flames as in like branded with a branding iron
02:27:57 Like the slaves will do so it could be a fish man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
02:28:03 But I think all the permanent fishermen have been like
02:28:06 Introduced and are either fisher tiger or someone else and I don't think it's any of the other people
02:28:13 Um other than that it could be someone wounded by someone who had a flaming devil fruit
02:28:18 Yeah, I can't think of anyone that would be
02:28:22 But I have heard just by people leave in comments that what if the whirlpool?
02:28:29 um
02:28:31 You do you remember the very beginning of one piece? No
02:28:33 Oh
02:28:35 Uh, well, yeah, no, I remember the yeah, what would you say in?
02:28:39 Luffy leaves on his journey after waiting 10 years after shanks left
02:28:44 He punches that fish that but shanks arm. You know the classic. Oh the um, I'm the the the the sea king
02:28:53 Sea king. Yeah, the the local village sea king tiny little guy
02:28:56 Bit shanks arm off. Luffy punches it and then immediately he's uh in a whirlpool and he'll die
02:29:03 right
02:29:04 He'll in a bit. He's in a big whirlpool and he's like, oh, I'm gonna drown
02:29:07 I guess I hide in this barrel and then that barrel gets found
02:29:13 By alvita's pirates and he meets kobe and all that stuff happens. Um, but the whirlpool
02:29:19 What if the whirlpool was because of the whirlpool guy was there?
02:29:23 What if the whirlpool was because the guy who makes whirlpools behind him with a potential devil fruit the guy man marked by flames
02:29:30 What if that guy was there? I can't think of any other reason why there would have been a whirlpool
02:29:36 It couldn't have been like a sea thing. It couldn't have just been a sea anomaly when you say that
02:29:41 Yeah, I mean, what yeah, what are the uh, oh, so you're saying that like the whirlpool they just happen like the sea just does things
02:29:49 Okay, uh, when you say that it makes me think of dragon
02:29:53 And the the lightning that struck at
02:29:56 rogueport
02:29:58 Remember he kind of like controlled the weather and like uh, yeah lightning struck what when elufi was going to get executed or something
02:30:07 Yeah, I don't know if it's clear what dragon's
02:30:11 Fruit has dragon seems to have some kind of weather control powers and he's got that scar on his face
02:30:16 I don't know. Maybe it's dragon. Maybe dragon is the man marked by flames
02:30:21 Monkey
02:30:23 A D dragon
02:30:28 He does have a big fucking scar although it looks more like a tattoo than a flame
02:30:32 Did I did I show did I show you that image of um, how it kind of looks like
02:30:37 The bottom of the of a shoe
02:30:39 As though garp had just like stomped stomped on his face with like a rubber sneakers
02:30:46 Okay
02:30:48 Abilities and powers
02:30:51 He's the supreme commander of the revolutionary army
02:30:54 um
02:30:59 I love one piece
02:31:01 I do I love scuffed piece. Uh, I love uh, the the retcons
02:31:07 I love when the rubber fruit becomes a magic cloud man fruit. Duh
02:31:12 I eat my slop. I do I unironically do
02:31:17 Okay, it remains unconfirmed if dragon was directly responsible for the wind blast or if he has a power enabling to create them
02:31:25 So we don't actually know if he has a fruit. We don't know anything about his powers
02:31:29 Uh, yeah, if he does have a weather control power
02:31:33 Then his ability to make weather things happen such as a lot of wind lightning potentially whirlpools
02:31:40 uh
02:31:42 I the reason I don't think is dragon is just because
02:31:45 The rumor of the guy traveling around in a black ship. They would just like the black pearl
02:31:51 From the fucking pirate to the cow. Do you think that it's just like a totally new guy?
02:31:57 That we haven't seen before I think
02:32:00 I think it's it's gotten a real
02:32:04 reason to be a guy we know. Yeah
02:32:07 um
02:32:09 It probably has
02:32:12 Like it could be like an old ally of like a famous pirate or a friend of someone who we do know already
02:32:19 Like oh, maybe Ray Lee knows them or I don't know
02:32:23 um, I think the the the
02:32:26 Clue would be the fact that at the bottom of the ocean near fishman island where it used to be
02:32:33 this
02:32:34 red poneglyph used to be there
02:32:37 um
02:32:38 And there's in its place a poneglyph that is an apology letter saying sorry. I had to move this
02:32:46 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Say that again
02:32:49 There's an apology poneglyph
02:32:51 It's just written as like sorry. I just I gotta take I think that's what it was. Wait, wait
02:32:56 Where huh? I'm sorry at the bottom at fishman island. There's an apology. They go from from who?
02:33:04 Oh, we don't know
02:33:05 Do we know what it's I'm sorry. Can you explain this to me like I am stupid? Yeah, I don't understand. I don't remember what you're talking about
02:33:12 I I looked at it a few weeks ago and I need to relook at it just to remember
02:33:18 um
02:33:19 So the poneglyphs we know about
02:33:21 Sea forest yugu kingdom fishman island
02:33:24 All right, nicka robin initially believed this poneglyph held vital information to understanding the void sentry
02:33:29 However, upon finding it she noted that it was different from the other poneglyphs
02:33:32 She had found reading more like an apology letter than a historical text the message was written by a man from the surface known as joyboy
02:33:38 Okay, so joyboy wrote this poneglyph
02:33:41 In the message, he apologized to the people of fishman island for breaking part of his promise
02:33:45 Which involves returning to fishman island to carry out noah's purpose. Okay, so that's not what I was returning to fishman island
02:33:51 To carry out noah's purpose. So he apologized for not doing that or he said he would do that
02:33:57 uh
02:33:58 Yeah, something about noah
02:34:00 Uh, the gigantic no is yeah, I was gonna say okay. No is the giant ship, right?
02:34:05 Okay. No. Yes. Here here it is
02:34:07 At least 25 years ago
02:34:09 This is the fourth
02:34:11 red
02:34:12 Road poneglyph
02:34:13 At least 25 years ago. This poneglyph was located at the sea forest next to joyboy's apology message
02:34:19 At a certain point later that the road poneglyph wereabouts became unknown and it is currently considered lust
02:34:26 And then there's a speculation however, it's speculated to be in the position of
02:34:31 Hino
02:34:32 Kizu who's the head Hino Hino Kizu is the
02:34:36 Oh, Hino Kizu is the name given to a mysterious man possessing a burn sky
02:34:39 It's just the the man the man marked by flames
02:34:42 Hino Iso
02:34:45 Hino Hino Kizu
02:34:49 So yeah, it used to be right next to joyboy's apology message next to fishman island at some point
02:34:55 25 years ago
02:34:57 Yeah, I mean someone like fisher tiger kind of makes sense
02:35:02 I don't know if fisher tiger is even alive, but um
02:35:06 Yeah, it's a mysterious man
02:35:09 And that's all we know
02:35:11 But we know it used to be under fishman island
02:35:14 So if there's any clues it would be some relation to fishman island man marked by flames
02:35:20 I immediately think of the sun pirates, you know the burns the the branding iron turned into a pirate emblem. Yeah
02:35:28 But I I don't know. I don't know how you could make that work
02:35:32 with fisher tiger
02:35:34 Or it could be just some other pirate crew member from that crew, but like
02:35:39 I don't know. Why would he do that? I guess a fishman might have the ability to do fishman karate and make whirlpools
02:35:46 Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, probably the blackbeard pirates were like
02:35:49 Hypothesizing that it was a devil fruit power and it might not be it might be a fishman karate technique
02:35:55 Something that jim pay could learn
02:35:57 Oh, fine. Oh our helmsman. We can level up our helmsman
02:36:02 You can get a power. Yes, okay
02:36:05 all right, so
02:36:08 Probably probably not gonna probably not gonna crack this mystery
02:36:12 No, yeah
02:36:13 Um, oh man, I'm gonna say it's a fishman. That's my vague guess
02:36:18 That it's at least a fishman
02:36:20 Because how could he put a fucking move it from under the ocean?
02:36:25 How they gonna move it?
02:36:27 Well, okay, we don't I mean we don't know that the guy who's got it now is the same guy who took it
02:36:34 In the first place so like a fish even if a fishman took it
02:36:37 He might have given it to some other guy this guy marked by flames or maybe that guy stole it from the other guy
02:36:43 Yeah, it could be a fishman. I don't know seems like it really could be anything
02:36:49 I mean a fish a tiger fish a tiger died from blood loss after being ambushed and shot by a squad of marines. Oh, no, he died. Oh
02:36:56 Yeah fringe
02:36:58 Cringe
02:37:01 Uh, why what a cool white all the good ones die
02:37:06 What a cool guy, you know, he was like, yeah, I'm racist, but
02:37:11 I get that I shouldn't be so I'm not gonna let it
02:37:15 Not was he racist? I thought he was definitely hated humans
02:37:18 He was he there's definitely a part where he's like, I hate humans
02:37:21 I'll never be able to stop hating humans because of what they did to me
02:37:24 But I understand that like a future where humans and fishman can like cooperate
02:37:30 Is like preferable
02:37:32 So I'm I'm not gonna like outlaw them or anything. He there was something like that
02:37:36 But yeah, he himself was like, yes, I cannot get over my hatred of humans
02:37:41 He's I'm reading and it says even though he hated humans according to Hancock
02:37:45 He did not discriminate against them when it came to slavery and liberated every one of them during his raid of marishwa
02:37:51 That's pretty cool. He hates hates humans, but he hates the institution of slavery even more. It was pretty reasonable
02:37:57 Yes, he did not believe in revenge on humans for the discrimination. He just don't like him. Just just is racist against sure
02:38:07 And I mean who's among us
02:38:09 His compassion to humans was further demonstrated when he vowed to take a child who was a former slave back to her hometown
02:38:16 Going as far as to mark her with his own jolly roger to lift the burden of slavery off her back
02:38:22 Yes, I remember that koala was the name of the girl, right
02:38:25 Right
02:38:27 And koala is in the revolutionary army, right? She's like, um, was friends with sabo
02:38:33 Yeah, that's the girl
02:38:36 I remember now sounds right. Yeah
02:38:40 Hey, yeah
02:38:42 Hey, yeah koala
02:38:44 One piece. Let me let me
02:38:49 Oh steam punk. Yeah, that was the girl that fisher tiger
02:38:53 Did something with
02:38:56 He brought her back to her hometown
02:38:59 Despite being a lowly little human the pee human give her watch
02:39:03 Give her watch the english dub
02:39:06 Like the four kids dub
02:39:07 You know that in the four I know in the four kids in the four kids dub arlong calls humans pee humans
02:39:15 Because they stink get it
02:39:18 Uh, he would do that. He would and he did
02:39:21 Oh, you can play as koala in one piece super grand battle x
02:39:27 I gotta buy holy shit
02:39:30 Bro
02:39:32 Check this out. You're not gonna believe this
02:39:39 Si
02:39:42 Oh, she's got chopper aside. Her head is way too big. What's simsie saying?
02:39:50 I
02:39:56 Don't don't understand
02:39:59 What is this
02:40:04 I don't know
02:40:09 Oh, that crawfish is gonna be delicious though
02:40:12 Why did he jump in there?
02:40:13 He didn't know what he didn't know what else to do. Oh poor little that uh, that's actually really upsetting
02:40:19 Just seeing him like I'm just gonna go over
02:40:24 Instant death
02:40:26 Probably not that instant not instant enough
02:40:29 Not instant enough
02:40:31 Unclear if uh mollusks feel pain
02:40:34 Or no, I guess they're not mollusks because they're crustaceans
02:40:37 I think I think crustaceans might not feel pain, you know, it makes me feel pain. That's bad enough
02:40:43 I I see what you I see what you mean
02:40:47 Um
02:40:49 Uh, okay. I mean pretty good one piece this week. Yes. I I guess it was pretty good
02:40:57 Yeah, it was shut up
02:40:59 I guess it was with your your you gotta have blind loyalty. Okay. We have blind loyalty on this show pretty pretty decent
02:41:06 Um, you know, sure it was sure it was scuffed and owed as a hack, but I mean, you know what I I've just I've just grown
02:41:13 Uh, I've just grown weary enough that I'll just accept whatever slop I'm giving. Oh, uh, uh, Cousin join the blackbeard pirate
02:41:22 Okay
02:41:24 Sure thing oda
02:41:26 Whatever you say, you know, he just you know, he just thinks I'm uh, he thinks I'm an idiot
02:41:30 He's gonna disrespect me like this, but you know what? I like it now
02:41:34 Um, oh one more thing one more. Yeah, I don't either one more thing. Um
02:41:40 Um
02:41:41 Briefly to mention is Beppo Beppo saved law. Thanks to chopper chopper giving him
02:41:47 Oh
02:41:51 That uh, okay, okay, okay before un
02:41:55 Uh documented creation of a Soulong ball or maybe it's just a rumble ball
02:42:00 Um that allows Beppo to go Soulong without the moon
02:42:05 Okay, Soulong is when a um, oh fuck. What are those people called?
02:42:09 Is when a mink when it's the full moon and the mink goes like hyper mode, right?
02:42:14 Okay, so
02:42:16 Did did chopper make a Soulong ball for?
02:42:18 Like carrot or someone did he make one of these before? No, no
02:42:22 This is the first time we have seen the idea of chopper using technology to do to put Soulong
02:42:28 I guess this was developed after wano
02:42:31 Before the three crews
02:42:34 Set their you know sites for different islands and left chopper was like
02:42:38 I wonder if Soulong could be like used more than just the full moon. I guess and then he made that little thing
02:42:44 Wow, there's a little panel where Beppo is eating something and he's remembering chopper
02:42:49 Oh, he's he's eating. Okay. I saw the little uh, oh, yeah, he chomps it. He chomps it. Yeah
02:42:55 Cute little chomp. Oh, he's so cute. He is
02:42:59 Beppo
02:43:01 And they turned into this giant
02:43:03 Flaming
02:43:04 Bear beast. Yeah, it's really cool. Actually. Yeah. Okay. I wasn't sure what was going on with the little chopper bubble
02:43:10 I see. Yes. He made a he made a Soulong ball, of course
02:43:15 Makes sense
02:43:16 So Beppo saves the captain
02:43:19 Yeah, uh, finally Beppo has done something
02:43:23 Every instance we've seen Beppo. He's been like he's just standing there
02:43:27 He's just been a cute funny bear who's always scared and and law
02:43:31 Presumably likes him because he's cute
02:43:33 Yeah, understandable
02:43:35 I just remembered because he mentions like the freezing ports of the north blue because he's from north blue
02:43:41 Uh, it's probably just because
02:43:43 Law was in the cold area and he met a bear
02:43:47 And a bear who was like, oh, I'm oh, I'm a little bear and law was like, ah, join my crew
02:43:56 And so they've been buddies forever
02:43:59 So this is this heartwarming
02:44:02 But uh, also the his entire crew is destroyed and his ship is destroyed and law is fucked
02:44:07 But he's not dead. He's not he's not fucked. He's got Beppo. He's got as long as he's got as long as he's got Beppo
02:44:13 there's hope
02:44:16 Yeah, so the new heart pirates are gonna be Beppo and law
02:44:20 um
02:44:21 There is that one guy
02:44:23 You can see it when the submarine is being destroyed the one guy on the left with the with the with the hair with the hair
02:44:29 he's the fishman from
02:44:32 a shabaldi
02:44:34 I remember him joining the the the the the heart pirates crew
02:44:40 After being saved by law during all that hubbub
02:44:43 Man
02:44:44 A submarine is awesome
02:44:46 It is it's awesome to have a submarine as your pirate ship
02:44:50 It's so cool pretty cowardly though. You can't show off your your big flag if you're underwater
02:44:56 Um, fuck off. Uh, he's got it painted on his side. It's fine. It's cool. You know what? He's
02:45:02 He's not he's not bound by tradition. He's think he's thinking outside the box and I appreciate it. Uh,
02:45:08 Yeah, damn now it's wrecked
02:45:11 It is pretty I guess that like there's not more submarine type things. I wonder who built that
02:45:17 Yeah
02:45:18 It does it makes you wonder why
02:45:20 Why does he have a submarine? Why is he the only one with a submarine?
02:45:25 What's going on?
02:45:26 He doesn't need to like coat his ship with like bubble goo to go to fishman island. He could just drive the ship there
02:45:34 It's see it seems like uh the ship can surface like it's upside down in this panel, but it seems like
02:45:42 There's like decks that you could stand on
02:45:44 Yeah, stuff like if it were if it were on so like yeah, it can come up and hang out on the surface if it wants to
02:45:50 I don't remember seeing it before. I'm sure we've seen it before. I just
02:45:53 Oh, no, we've seen it loads of times. Yeah
02:45:56 Yeah, I just I mean that was the ship that was the ship that saved luffy during the war at marenford
02:46:02 Right
02:46:05 You know I just
02:46:07 So hard to keep
02:46:09 Everything sorted in my mind
02:46:12 Uh, I just I see this and I'm like, yeah, okay
02:46:15 I I don't remember, but I'm sure that that's what it looked like. Uh, it's it's cool
02:46:21 I mean, I don't think we've seen it in a while. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just I'm you know
02:46:25 I look at this and it's it's as though it were new to me and I nod and I go, huh cool ship
02:46:30 Yeah, cool ship too bad. It's dead too bad. Oh, well
02:46:34 Um, so yeah, that was a good chapter
02:46:36 I await more
02:46:39 What's what's uh
02:46:41 What's what's gonna happen? I mean, well, okay, we've seen laws fate
02:46:46 Law is yeah blackbird has
02:46:49 two
02:46:51 Do you think we still don't know if law like luffy shared the one from inside the uh
02:46:58 The thing I guess I guess to keep the stakes high. Maybe it was all three
02:47:02 And so they shared all three so now shanks blackbeard and luffy have three of the four
02:47:08 And they're all looking for the mysterious man
02:47:11 Yeah, and whoever finds him first that would make sense would be able to get it I guess
02:47:17 That would that would make sense
02:47:20 um
02:47:21 Do you think
02:47:22 I mean kuzan is seems to have been beaten or is
02:47:27 I think the fight fight might go on but I don't think kuzan
02:47:33 That there's there's two ways it could go one is kuzan could
02:47:37 Ultimately decimate everyone and then kill kobe and that's bad because kobe needs to escape
02:47:44 I think garp might sacrifice himself to save kobe
02:47:47 But I also don't know if kuzan would want to go far enough
02:47:51 To actually kill garp. I don't think so. I really don't think so
02:47:55 Uh, but I think maybe to keep up appearances. He would do it
02:48:00 If it if his if his goal matters that much that he needs to stay
02:48:04 Like undercover that hard, but like I don't know. Well, maybe that would be a real that'd be a real heel turn
02:48:11 Moment for him. That would be really crossing a line. Yeah
02:48:16 Uh, I think I think it seems like he's done and it seems like his powers don't work on garp and like
02:48:23 He hesitated and it doesn't seem like he's he's fighting at full strength. I think
02:48:29 I don't know. Do you think garp is is garp just gonna run wild and just like beat beat the freaking uh
02:48:36 crew
02:48:37 I don't think he he can't beat the entirety of the blackbeard crew other than like
02:48:42 He can't beat like four blackbeard guys. No, I don't think so
02:48:46 Yeah, especially since one of them is the island they're standing on
02:48:50 They're I think they're probably gonna be I think probably because kuzan
02:48:54 Is sort of throwing
02:48:56 I think he's probably just they're gonna get away with kobe
02:49:00 Yeah, I think kobe's gonna survive
02:49:02 I don't know if garp is but I think kobe is gonna survive
02:49:06 Yeah, I could I could see garp dying but not from kuzan
02:49:10 One of the other one of the other guys might
02:49:13 Might get him. Yeah, and kuzan wouldn't be able to help garp without ruining everything for himself
02:49:18 Possibly
02:49:21 Well, cuz um cuz cuz garp couldn't save
02:49:26 Uh ace
02:49:29 Because he had to stand by be like, uh, I couldn't uh couldn't do anything. They were executing ace. I just couldn't do anything
02:49:35 I'm a marine. That's my job. I just had to just had to stand there and watch and kuzan would be like, uh, well
02:49:40 I'm a blackbeard. You know, I just just had to stand there and watch while they killed my old uh
02:49:45 My old master. Well, that was the brakes, I guess
02:49:49 Would kind would kind of be uh
02:49:52 Sort of fitting and for garp in a way, I guess
02:49:57 I mean garp's old
02:49:58 You know what he deserves to die
02:50:01 For being for being old
02:50:04 Um
02:50:06 Hmm
02:50:08 Yeah, so
02:50:09 There's gonna be obviously egghead is probably what's happening. We're gonna focus on again after this
02:50:18 Cuz blackbeard is um his way on his ship
02:50:23 With probably every blackbeard pirate that is not featured in this little garp mission
02:50:33 And they're going to a
02:50:35 They're going they probably have putting in the brig
02:50:39 And they haven't seen egghead in a while. It's been like three weeks. Oh, yeah
02:50:45 Le Mans
02:50:48 Ah, there's so much and then there's the big buster call. There's the
02:50:53 Antony Garcia. What is the fuck?
02:50:56 uh
02:50:58 J garcia sadden j garcia sadden. Are they are they buster calling egghead? Is that what they're doing?
02:51:04 There's something calling. I don't think it's literally a buster call
02:51:06 But it's just like a fuck ton of battleships are coming
02:51:09 Yeah, uh to destroy this island because of information
02:51:14 given to them by

02:52:40 Png release format
02:52:43 I give you wrong ban you right? You should just focus on one type of release. Thanks. Don't divide your small audience even further
02:52:54 Um
02:52:55 Don't rely on multiple people
02:52:58 You're like, oh, I want to I want to be I want to see that again
02:53:02 and just put a lot of effort into something that's
02:53:05 Gonna satisfy two people
02:53:09 Uh, sorry if this is too authoritative
02:53:15 That's fine. You can do that. I don't remember what was the other point. Uh, goodbye. Yeah, um
02:53:22 Um
02:53:24 I was um, I think probably making it as gifts is just like
02:53:30 It's probably better just to not do it because it's like it's like a lot more work
02:53:36 and like
02:53:37 Does it does it increase?
02:53:39 enjoyment
02:53:40 For the reader like a ton
02:53:42 maybe sometimes
02:53:43 But like I can just make the panels look good
02:53:46 In a static format too. Yeah, and that's fine
02:53:49 My my my thing is still like
02:53:53 You may be making two people
02:53:55 More happy, but if one of those people is me the author then I would do it because fuck it
02:54:02 Yeah, I mean, yeah
02:54:06 I'm I'm not I'm not smart
02:54:09 I understand that in in in like a in like a efficiency way, but that's why I draw
02:54:15 I
02:54:16 me
02:54:18 As the author
02:54:19 Yeah, I guess like having it be exactly the way I wanted it to be would make me
02:54:25 Would make me happy, but on the one hand
02:54:29 There's always going to be compromise in anything you do. Nothing will ever be perfect
02:54:34 and
02:54:35 Yeah, having making it one way
02:54:39 If I if I make it one way in static images and then I go back and I make it again in gift form
02:54:45 That
02:54:46 Even though I might like the result that process is going to make me miserable
02:54:49 Sure, because I'm just be like I've already done it. So I think my my happiness would be decreased
02:54:56 So, yeah, I think uh
02:54:59 Perfect comic party static images is what I'm going to do for the time being
02:55:03 Um next one is called slime and punishment book three two one go
02:55:08 Ah, yes, Ben, please
02:55:11 please
02:55:13 release
02:55:14 Slime and punishment as a god damn
02:55:18 A comic already
02:55:20 I've been waiting for a year. I've been sorry
02:55:24 Some people to read it as I borrowed it to them
02:55:28 For a year and they are still waiting
02:55:32 Besides that
02:55:33 I really would like them to experience the game because I love the game
02:55:38 It's the main thing that makes me want to buy this expensive. That's the thing
02:55:43 It's gonna be that expensive
02:55:45 Unless you're foreign
02:55:47 I want to know is the comic doesn't comic make it obvious when
02:55:54 You could just play the game instead of reading the comic version
02:55:59 Uh, please and thank you. I mean
02:56:03 I mean, there's a section of the comic where the panels are
02:56:09 Like game in-game shots. So like yeah, it's really it's really clear what part is the game and what part is not
02:56:17 Uh, it's like I think it's like 30 pages or something. It's like 35 pages
02:56:21 Uh, you know, I just got I just this week. It was late
02:56:26 I ordered from etsy a piece of fluorescent pink fabric to be my green my black light green screen
02:56:32 for that shot I wanted to do for the um

02:57:59 You know life is a chance
02:58:03 Specifically this guy gets me
02:58:07 Who is this guy this guy's a this guy's a genius
02:58:13 I don't know. I don't know
02:58:16 All right. Hmm. Okay. Next one is called chris lan from prince isolation three two one go
02:58:23 All right, mr. Match. I guess I can do you this one favor. All right. Let me go up to my bathroom and
02:58:34 Son of you jack into my toaster
02:58:37 All right. I'm on the net
02:58:40 What's that mr. Match
02:58:42 One more program to upload to my toaster
02:58:46 Well, I suppose I could I suppose I can do that
02:58:50 I could suppose I can upload one more little little little thing or whatnot in my toaster
02:58:56 Okay, here goes or whatnot
02:59:03 What mr. Match my house is on fire
02:59:09 I think it was a coffee maker. I think it was a coffee maker that
02:59:14 Lipped her house on fire
02:59:17 That's um mr
02:59:20 Mr. Match is a guy from
02:59:22 Uh mega man battle network. He tells you that he's good. He's a bad guy, but then he tells you he's good now
02:59:29 Hey, I'm good now. Hey now that I'm good. Would you go around and
02:59:32 Put all these programs into all these important machines
02:59:35 And then you do it and then there's like, ah, it was bad. Ah, the place is on fire. Ah, everything's on fire
02:59:40 Ah, your dad's in the hospital the mal
02:59:43 Gotcha
02:59:44 Gotcha
02:59:46 All right, next one is called sick new t-shirts 3 2 1 go
02:59:50 Um, you should make a t-shirt with the new pcp like icon like the skull icon
02:59:56 On it because that's true that is hell and uh, it it belongs on a shirt. I think it would work really well
03:00:02 Um, I've noticed that the old tpc logo
03:00:05 Shirt has it as like just a really big image on the shirt, which I think maybe would work better for the skull
03:00:11 I don't think it worked well for that one. I think it would have been better as like a breast
03:00:14 Like the small image on the breast area, you know what I'm talking about
03:00:19 I know exactly what you're talking about, but for the skull, maybe that one would work with both of those formats
03:00:23 I don't know. I don't know. I'm just I'm just telling you what I want to see
03:00:26 I'm just telling you what I want to see so I can give you money
03:00:29 You know what? I think he's right. No reason not to make a shirt with the new branding. Yeah
03:00:35 Okay, can I get a bigger cut because I made the logo
03:00:39 Oh
03:01:01 Next one is called
03:01:03 WTF 321 go
03:01:05 What the fuck been saint?
03:01:07 How the hell did you look at $2,000 for americans and think that's way too much
03:01:15 And chopped it up the stock market some bullshit deficits
03:01:18 He really said fuck your rent and the fact that you're essential in some ways you're worse than
03:01:24 Reagan and Thatcher
03:01:26 Was it we still are two are already dead
03:01:30 2023 only just started and you're already making it worse
03:01:50 I don't know what I did. I don't know
03:01:53 You're seeing a song and I could not for the life of me figure out what song
03:01:57 Was he talking about the covid relief $2,000 for americans when when I say that wasn't that was too much
03:02:06 That's silly. That's silly
03:02:09 Um, thanks for the voice
03:02:14 I don't even know why why would you say these things? Um, okay, uh, next one is called. Oh, it's an image. Okay. Let's take a look
03:02:24 It's an image
03:02:27 Okay
03:02:31 It's jesse serving me a dmca. I'm sure to win because my flange is superior
03:02:40 Well, I mean
03:02:42 It's just true. It's just true
03:02:45 It's exactly how it it it would go and how it did go
03:02:50 Thank you
03:02:51 voice mailman
03:02:53 Uh, let's uh, let's look at the next one
03:02:58 Oh, it's a
03:02:59 anime girl
03:03:01 Of some kind
03:03:03 It sure is sure is it sure is
03:03:08 I don't uh, I don't get it
03:03:10 Next one is called my darkest fantasy
03:03:13 fugitive ben saint 3 2 1 go
03:03:19 So, um, if you killed someone and
03:03:22 There was a dead body sitting in the middle of your room right now
03:03:28 Uh, what would you do with the body and then after that will be your next move?
03:03:33 And everyone knows everyone knows that that person was at your house
03:03:41 Hmm. Oh, did you kill them? That's the important part
03:03:46 If he doesn't say you killed them, so I'm thinking no you didn't
03:03:49 Well, if I didn't then I would call the police and say there's a corpse in my house and I don't know what happened
03:03:56 Because then I'm like, oh, I reported the body. I didn't do it because I didn't yeah
03:04:03 Yeah, if you just if I try to hide it then you could get caught and then
03:04:08 You're obviously implicated as the culprit
03:04:12 Let me let me listen again
03:04:15 No, no, he does it if you killed someone. Okay, so if I killed him
03:04:21 Um or her don't exclude
03:04:24 um
03:04:27 I mean, I guess I would
03:04:30 I think
03:04:31 ooh
03:04:33 Okay
03:04:36 I think
03:04:39 That I'm not smart enough to like get away with it
03:04:43 So so I think the move is
03:04:48 Okay, the move is probably
03:04:53 Hide the body as quickly as I can maybe you know, maybe bury it maybe maybe
03:04:59 Bury it like that night like dig a hole and bury it in the backyard. No, maybe that's even like two
03:05:06 That's a lot of work moving enough dirt to put a human being underground. I genuinely think
03:05:13 Actually that I might just put the body in my closet or something
03:05:18 Like put the like because like people might see me digging people might see me digging
03:05:23 Whereas like if it's just in my room like nobody's gonna come into my room until like a police investigation starts
03:05:29 so I think I might just hide the body in my closet
03:05:33 and then
03:05:34 just like
03:05:36 Get all my money
03:05:37 Get all the money that I have like like withdraw it from all my accounts that I have access to and just like
03:05:44 I put it to bitcoin
03:05:45 I put it to bitcoin. No and just and just flee somewhere and just like flee to I don't know canada or something
03:05:51 You get caught in canada
03:05:54 You got to go like to a small island in the pacific
03:05:59 Yeah, maybe maybe the philippines or something
03:06:03 They they don't have america laws
03:06:07 I don't know how laws work. I don't I wonder if my oh, I might need to renew my passport. I'm not sure if my passport's still valid
03:06:15 Yeah, I think
03:06:17 The the move is hide quick quickly hide the body
03:06:21 Get as get as much of my money as I can
03:06:24 and just
03:06:25 Try and escape
03:06:27 to somewhere and and go off the grid
03:06:32 Because uh, I don't think there's any I don't think there's any like getting away with it
03:06:38 So you're you're resigning yourself to the fact that people will eventually find it and know that you were a murderer
03:06:44 So you can never come back
03:06:47 Yeah, probably yeah
03:06:50 I mean, um
03:06:53 Maybe I could um, I mean, maybe I could try to make it look like an accident it would depend how I killed them
03:07:00 Yeah, I don't know I don't think about this
03:07:03 So I don't know what I would do
03:07:05 If I killed someone I probably I think I think I think about it all the time
03:07:09 I'm always thinking about this
03:07:12 Uh, like if it was premeditated
03:07:15 Yeah, I probably would have already had a plan but I just like yeah, he didn't say he didn't say it was premeditated
03:07:20 He he might have just done it in the heat of the moment
03:07:24 And if that's the case
03:07:27 Like depending on if I already
03:07:31 I don't know
03:07:32 Like right now answering this question. I don't know if there's like
03:07:36 some
03:07:37 lesser sentence I could get for like oh, it was
03:07:41 Just because I was really mad because they beat me in fortnight or whatever or whatever it was
03:07:46 I think they said I was ugly and I killed them
03:07:50 I think you would be I would still get murder charge. It wouldn't be a different type of thing
03:07:56 Unless I plead insanity, but then I'd have to prove that and I can't do that. It's hard
03:08:03 Depending on how you did it. You might be able to get the charges reduced to like manslaughter. Maybe
03:08:09 Like maybe
03:08:10 Yeah, you didn't intend to kill them. I don't think I would be emotionally or
03:08:17 Yeah, I wouldn't be emotionally prepared to think about running away forever
03:08:23 I would yeah, I would probably end up serving some jail time
03:08:27 Hopefully not the maximum amount
03:08:30 You would probably go to jail for years
03:08:34 Hey, at least I don't go to play rent
03:08:38 Yeah
03:08:39 Yeah
03:08:40 Hell yeah, I mean true. I mean true. They don't have estrogen in jail though. That's the part
03:08:48 That's probably true
03:08:50 Oh
03:08:52 Prisons are woke now
03:08:56 Yeah, I think my move is I think my move is probably flee
03:09:00 Honestly, it's a better move than I'm just trying to think how I would react
03:09:04 I feel like I wouldn't be able to handle it. I would have a fucking breakdown
03:09:08 I I get it. I get it. I understand the fleeing hiding them and then fleeing is like
03:09:16 Well
03:09:17 That I mean that probably makes it that makes my eventual sentence worse if I ever get caught which I probably will
03:09:24 Let's be real. I'm gonna get caught. They're gonna come for me
03:09:28 May as well
03:09:31 Have some maybe the move is maybe the move is just just give up turn myself in immediately
03:09:38 I don't know. I don't know. Is that the move?
03:09:41 Does that reduce the eventual consequences
03:09:43 What if the person what if the person you killed was like everyone hated them and you get a real real small sentence
03:09:51 If honestly if I think if I think if everyone hated them
03:09:55 Like nobody like this person at all. Yeah, I think I mean, I would probably still get
03:10:00 sentenced to something
03:10:02 but
03:10:03 sentenced to
03:10:04 A party
03:10:06 If but if no if nobody is like if nobody is like pursuing this case like know what there's no one who's like
03:10:13 Really dedicated to making this conviction happen. I feel like yeah, it's probably I'm probably gonna get a pretty light sentence
03:10:20 If I have a zealous advocate
03:10:23 Yeah
03:10:25 So that would change things a little bit
03:10:28 I'd be like, yeah, I killed this guy
03:10:30 Yeah, but you know, I said the moral victory though because he was a jerk and nobody liked him
03:10:34 Yeah, he was illegal
03:10:35 But you know, everyone kind of wanted to do it and everyone would be like, yeah, I thought about it all the time
03:10:40 Ben was the only one brave enough
03:10:42 to actually do it
03:10:44 Yeah
03:10:45 All right. All right
03:10:47 Next one is
03:10:49 Okay, well the next one is a
03:10:51 Link and I gather it seems like it's a link to
03:10:58 Okay, it's the Mon Ben guys channel
03:11:02 But what do I care about this guy's youtube channel
03:11:07 This orisawa
03:11:09 Yeah, I don't care I don't care this guy's got a youtube channel
03:11:15 I've never read any of this guy's stuff
03:11:18 Have you?
03:11:19 Uh, no, in fact, I haven't even really watched Mon Ben yet. I keep thinking I should I will I will but I don't
03:11:27 This is the guy he did a 20th century boys and monster
03:11:32 Oh, I fucking have read 20th century boys and I've watched some of monster
03:11:37 I like his stuff
03:11:40 20th century boys is really good. You did did you not know that that's the guy that hosts Mon Ben?
03:11:45 No, I think I I think you must have you've explained it before and I guess I forgot
03:11:51 No
03:11:53 Well, I'm not I'm not super familiar with his work outside of that
03:11:57 Oh, and then this is someone on my stream was telling me to watch
03:12:00 I guess the new oris or a orisawa is the thing called Pluto
03:12:05 And someone was telling me I should watch Pluto
03:12:08 so I don't know
03:12:10 Maybe I will oh, it's on netflix. Oh, I can't watch it then
03:12:14 I don't have netflix. I don't have anything. I'm off the grid
03:12:17 I'm off the grid in case I ever kill someone and they need to escape really fast
03:12:21 So it won't be that much of a culture shock
03:12:23 If you kill someone and you have a netflix account, it's all over. Yeah, that's how they'll get you
03:12:28 Like oh, but I really want to watch but I really want to watch Pluto though. I'll see where I
03:12:33 He's signing in from canada. Go go go get him
03:12:36 Uh, all right. Next one is called is this the end three two one go
03:12:43 I
03:12:45 Did present time ha ha ha ha
03:12:50 Then Saint is planning on abandoning communism and doing profit from other's comics
03:12:56 GINE take his planning on helping them come on to the closet and become a woman
03:13:01 Ben was always destined to be
03:13:04 Red condo. Gin finally came out killing most of the pcp watcher base
03:13:09 Half of them died from heart failure, and another have died from nosebleed.
03:13:14 And this just finally got paid.
03:13:17 Good for him.
03:13:18 False.
03:13:19 Cheesy despite the edgy tweets.
03:13:22 Has grown soft and vulnerable.
03:13:24 The oblivion fall was sucked into the giant mommy milkers.
03:13:29 And the good voicemails were no more.
03:13:33 And Cybershell, the last YouTuber, was nowhere to be found.
03:13:39 This is it.
03:13:40 This is the end.
03:13:42 The Batman is dead.
03:13:44 The podcast is dead.
03:13:46 And I am the last one standing here laughing like a lunatic.
03:13:54 Give me a headache.
03:13:56 Is that the Joker, baby?
03:13:59 I don't know.
03:14:01 I think it's the Joker from something.
03:14:04 I think he meant Jesse got paid from the Radcon funds, which is technically true.
03:14:08 Yes, technically true.
03:14:09 Yes, we all got paid.
03:14:10 Even the people I don't like got paid from the Radcon funds.
03:14:13 I couldn't do anything about it.
03:14:21 It's the end of an arc.
03:14:23 The end of an era.
03:14:24 Perfect comic party is the new arc.
03:14:27 It's getting an ultra slow start.
03:14:29 Sorry, I didn't get it done this week.
03:14:31 That's okay.
03:14:32 I'm also being very sluggish with everything.
03:14:35 But I'm late now because the Clarissa that was supposed to be in the first one
03:14:42 is the one that you've already finished, right?
03:14:44 Like you're already done with the chapter.
03:14:46 So I'm late.
03:14:47 I've been late for...
03:14:48 Hey, how long ago did we come up with the idea for the perfect comic party?
03:14:53 I want to make myself feel bad for a minute.
03:14:56 Well, I didn't really start hankering down.
03:15:02 On the Clarissa until March?
03:15:06 Oh, really?
03:15:07 I think February...
03:15:09 No, it was February.
03:15:11 I was drawing Clarissa and doing Febubri during February.
03:15:19 Oh.
03:15:20 And I sort of stopped Febubri and I was continuing to draw Clarissa.
03:15:23 So it must have been February or January, the end of January where we had the idea.
03:15:28 I had the idea, I don't know.
03:15:30 I think I mentioned it.
03:15:32 That's not as bad as I thought.
03:15:34 No, it was not last year.
03:15:36 This is like a new year and oh, everything sucks.
03:15:40 What are we going to do?
03:15:42 What are we going to do?
03:15:43 And it was just like born from that.
03:15:45 Right, right.
03:15:47 Yeah, I was...
03:15:51 Okay, well, you know, the goal of the perfect comic party is to be monthly.
03:15:58 This month, you know, now it's been like almost three months since we started to have the idea.
03:16:08 I'm going to be done soon.
03:16:10 Once the content for the first one is done, we'll get everything sorted out.
03:16:15 We'll sort out the format, we'll figure out.
03:16:18 And then the next one will just be content.
03:16:22 Maybe the second one won't come out in one month, but it'll be like...
03:16:27 Well, we'll shoot for a month.
03:16:29 We'll shoot for a month and we'll end among the stars.
03:16:32 That's right, that's right.
03:16:36 A couple more Biscuits pages to go and then I'll be done with this chapter.
03:16:43 Next one.
03:16:45 Oh, a hopeful.
03:16:47 Next one is called This is Not the End.
03:16:49 We have hope yet.
03:16:51 Three, two, one, go.
03:16:57 Metta-Man, wake up.
03:16:59 We are in big trouble.
03:17:01 Dr. Wahwee has spread robo-
03:17:04 Wahwee.
03:17:06 It has a ready-to-form, the famous Megumin YouTuber.
03:17:12 Into a zoombie with purple skin and green teeth.
03:17:17 What the actual fuck?
03:17:19 Get away from me, you crazy bum.
03:17:22 You smell of beer and pee.
03:17:24 Gross.
03:17:25 Go.
03:17:26 Get a shower.
03:17:27 Or something.
03:17:28 Also acid green tea, thorough hip, new thing.
03:17:31 And I tweet light-farkle.
03:17:33 A legally distinct individual from recently deceased twilight sparkle.
03:17:39 And always on top of hip new things.
03:17:42 Oh no, so you are already in pain.
03:17:45 In all, in fear, infected.
03:17:48 Yes, I am indeed already a rowdy cock cucker.
03:17:52 And I do not help with PCP obsession with comics.
03:17:56 In fact, I will do the exact opposite.
03:18:00 I will send my own comic to PC.
03:18:04 In the very next voicemail.
03:18:12 Oh no, God.
03:18:14 No, this is so tragic and terrible.
03:18:17 I think the next voicemail is an image from Drinking Moth.
03:18:24 So I think this might be...
03:18:26 These might all be from Drinking Moth.
03:18:28 Wow.
03:18:29 There's a five seconds of this audio.
03:18:33 Five seconds?
03:18:35 You say?
03:18:36 Oh, right.
03:18:37 Is it really?
03:18:38 Three, two, one, go.
03:18:43 Okay.
03:18:44 Oh, it's a whole comic.
03:18:46 This is a real comic.
03:18:51 Oh, okay.
03:18:53 Static dome, prophet spires in the city heart.
03:18:59 Should we read this right now?
03:19:01 I don't know if it's...
03:19:03 It's kind of long.
03:19:05 Yeah, this is very substantial.
03:19:07 I want to read it later, I guess.
03:19:10 Because we'd just be silent for a while.
03:19:14 Although...
03:19:15 That's how we do the one piece.
03:19:19 So I'm not...
03:19:20 How far down does it go?
03:19:22 I think...
03:19:23 Load 10 more images.
03:19:25 I think that maybe...
03:19:26 Okay.
03:19:27 Holy shit.
03:19:28 Yeah, it's quite long.
03:19:30 Okay, we can't read it right now.
03:19:32 Wait, how many pages does it have a page count?
03:19:34 Oh, it just keeps going.
03:19:35 Oh, God, there's 10 more...
03:19:37 What is this, like 30 pages?
03:19:39 It's a whole comic.
03:19:41 Hang on.
03:19:42 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
03:19:52 Am I crazy or are these pages really long?
03:19:55 Eight, nine, ten...
03:19:57 They are a little taller than A4.
03:20:00 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24...
03:20:15 Okay, I think it's 24 pages.
03:20:18 Here's what I think.
03:20:19 Here's what I think.
03:20:22 I do want to read this.
03:20:24 I think we should invite Drinking Moth to submit this
03:20:29 to submission for the perfect comic party.
03:20:32 And maybe we can put it...
03:20:34 Wait, is that punk?
03:20:35 No.
03:20:36 No, it's not punk.
03:20:37 There's punk?
03:20:38 No, she's just orange.
03:20:39 No, she's just orange.
03:20:41 Oh.
03:20:42 I think we should invite Drinking Moth to submit this to the perfect comic party.
03:20:48 And then when we do...
03:20:50 We can do an episode...
03:20:51 This was my plan before.
03:20:52 We could do an episode where we discuss the content of the perfect comic party.
03:20:56 And then we can go over this and other...
03:21:00 Whatever else is in there.
03:21:02 What do you think about that?
03:21:04 I think that is pretty good.
03:21:06 Okay.
03:21:07 And I agree.
03:21:08 Drinking Moth on the show would be nice.
03:21:11 Yeah.
03:21:12 I think I've said it before, but I was very impressed with Drinking Moth.
03:21:17 Drinking Moth ended up...
03:21:18 I think she ended up doing the most pages of the eventual Rad Condition.
03:21:23 And she did them really fast.
03:21:26 Like remarkably fast.
03:21:27 She would have like the page done like the next day.
03:21:30 It was crazy.
03:21:31 So I really appreciated that and I thought her work was really good.
03:21:36 And a reminder, read the dojo and it's on the PCP website and the stuff you can download
03:21:42 it and read it for free to see more of her work and others as well.
03:21:46 Okay.
03:21:47 Is the PCP website up?
03:21:49 Yeah.
03:21:50 Yeah.
03:21:51 Okay.
03:21:52 It is up.
03:21:54 It is currently...
03:21:55 What's the deal?
03:21:58 The...
03:21:59 Yeah.
03:22:00 Okay.
03:22:01 The DMCA thing.
03:22:04 My domains, St. Comics are on my host and those have been hit with the DMCA.
03:22:09 The PCP domain is not on that host.
03:22:13 It's a different host.
03:22:14 The files are hosted with that host, but the domain is with a different company and it
03:22:21 just points to those files.
03:22:23 So I just need to...
03:22:25 The DMCA will...
03:22:27 I just need to put the files on the new host.
03:22:30 So I don't need to transfer domains for the PCP website.
03:22:35 So the reason why the St. Comics is down is because the domain needs to transfer.
03:22:39 PCP doesn't need to do that.
03:22:41 I just need to click around a little bit and just tell it, yeah, point to a different file
03:22:47 location.
03:22:50 So the PCP website is up for the moment.
03:22:52 It will be down...
03:22:53 It might be down for a day or two soon.
03:22:56 Oh, okay.
03:22:58 Scream.
03:22:59 Okay.
03:23:00 Anyway, do not read Drinking Moth's comic.
03:23:13 Do not read it until it is in the perfect comic party.
03:23:16 Do not do it.
03:23:20 Here we go.
03:23:21 Next one is called B&G Appreciation Hour from Prince Isolation.
03:23:26 Oh, there is a voicemail attached.
03:23:28 So let's listen to that 3, 2, 1, go.
03:23:30 Hi, we're back with the Ben and Gibb Appreciation Hour.
03:23:34 Today, I want to show appreciation for the beautiful artistic dynamic between the characters
03:23:40 of Ben St. and Gibb and Tay.
03:23:42 Wrong.
03:23:44 One facet of their fascinating friendship and character relationship.
03:23:50 So enjoy this little fan art piece I've made of a very important, classic type of interaction
03:23:59 between the two, you know?
03:24:02 Are you seeing this?
03:24:04 Yeah, I'm looking at it.
03:24:06 People I hate, ironic bigotry, semi-ironic nihilism, something absolutely insane.
03:24:11 Okay.
03:24:13 Okay.
03:24:18 Perfect dynamic.
03:24:20 The perfect dynamic party.
03:24:25 The branding is just so strong.
03:24:27 You can't help but say something like that with that acronym.
03:24:32 There's an alternate version.
03:24:36 I like the alternate version.
03:24:37 Oh, with boobs.
03:24:38 I see, I see.
03:24:39 Boobs added.
03:24:42 Next one is Cheesy Audio Appreciation Hour.
03:24:47 Okay, from Prince Isolation, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:24:51 Yeah, so I think that maybe I had it right with the way I've published things all along, really.
03:24:57 Maybe I should just keep publishing digitally and doing pre-order things.
03:25:04 Maybe that just works way better.
03:25:08 And I think that maybe I had it right all along.
03:25:12 I should just continue to do it the way I'm doing it.
03:25:15 I mean, I'm seeing that people that are not like me or that are doing it more like old-style,
03:25:21 they're just like kind of making less money and they're just like, you know, they really...
03:25:28 I'm just wondering, hold on, hold on.
03:25:31 Yeah, and I think that maybe I should just...
03:25:46 Does Cheesy make loud noises that much?
03:25:48 I don't know.
03:25:52 I do think Cheesy's mic quality is not great.
03:25:55 He needs a better mic.
03:25:57 But in terms of like moving around and banging stuff, I don't know if he does it that much.
03:26:03 But yeah, I don't know.
03:26:06 But it's okay, because it said no hate, just love.
03:26:09 So it's fine.
03:26:10 Yeah.
03:26:11 So it's fine.
03:26:12 It's good.
03:26:13 It's fine.
03:26:14 It's good.
03:26:15 Next one is...
03:26:17 Oh, I didn't download that one.
03:26:19 Next one is Ben Appreciation Minute, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:26:23 So in preparation for the eventual coming out of the perfect comic party,
03:26:27 I finally decided to cave and sub to the prestigious Procrastinators podcast, patreon.patreon.com.
03:26:35 Finally!
03:26:36 Procrastinators, by the way.
03:26:38 And in the meanwhile, I've had the chance to listen to some of the bonus content featured there.
03:26:42 And specifically, I was listening to the commentary track for the Radcon 2 documentary.
03:26:48 And I just really quickly wanted to highlight a funny little thing that Ben did that's very indicative of his online persona,
03:26:54 his character, as you might say.
03:26:57 So Gibbon is saying about DeVoo.
03:27:00 She's saying like, you know, DeVoo, DeVoo, she's a little awkward and stuff.
03:27:05 But you know, she's interesting.
03:27:06 I like her.
03:27:07 She's interesting.
03:27:08 And then there's a silence.
03:27:11 And then Ben just says, well...
03:27:14 And I appreciated that.
03:27:16 Very tough to your hater behavior on your report, Ben.
03:27:20 Okay.
03:27:21 Bye-bye.
03:27:22 Thanks.
03:27:23 Yeah, I'm a hater.
03:27:25 Yeah, whatever.
03:27:27 Okay, next one is an image.
03:27:32 Want to draw today?
03:27:34 Not really.
03:27:35 Implacent Western artist.
03:27:37 Third worlders.
03:27:38 Ears are in $5 per hour.
03:27:44 It's so true.
03:27:46 It is so true.
03:27:47 I feel so sea.
03:27:49 Want to draw today?
03:27:50 Not really.
03:27:51 When would I ever want to draw?
03:27:54 I started drawing earlier and I couldn't do it because I was sick.
03:28:01 I woke up thinking that I was over my illness and I sat down at my computer and I was like
03:28:09 sitting there just like freezing and sweating and like aching.
03:28:14 And I'm just like...
03:28:17 I must have sat there for a couple of hours until I just gave up and went back to sleep.
03:28:23 And you know what?
03:28:24 Strikingly not that different from a usual day.
03:28:28 A non-sick day in my life.
03:28:32 The results were largely the same.
03:28:39 To be a third worlder eager to earn $5 per hour.
03:28:44 Yeah, we should go live in a third world.
03:28:47 That's the play.
03:28:49 Ask not for lighter burdens but broader shoulders.
03:28:53 The third worlder eager to earn $5 per hour has the broader shoulders of all.
03:28:57 It's the dream.
03:28:59 Okay, next one is a VVV comic from Vinny.
03:29:05 Got to organize time better to get these out sooner at LoveU.com.
03:29:10 Well, let's take a look.
03:29:13 So long.
03:29:14 Been safe.
03:29:15 Your treachery shall be avenged here by my Kawasaki blade.
03:29:18 I remember that.
03:29:19 Shwing.
03:29:21 Previously on Vinny's Comic, you've made a grave mistake to choose this fight.
03:29:25 I will not die here.
03:29:27 Ooh.
03:29:28 The sword like trails the scene.
03:29:33 Haha.
03:29:34 Nice slash, but that was made.
03:29:37 Wait, but that won't make the cut.
03:29:39 Haha.
03:29:40 Yes.
03:29:41 True.
03:29:42 Huh?
03:29:43 What is this?
03:29:45 Gurgle, gurgle.
03:29:47 This is eating through the floor.
03:29:49 Whoa.
03:29:50 Whoa.
03:29:52 Creek schlump.
03:29:54 Fuck you, Ben Sainto.
03:29:58 Ben, is he?
03:29:59 Brace yourselves.
03:30:01 Oh, my God.
03:30:02 I'm bracing.
03:30:03 Is that tiny?
03:30:04 Ben did something to the air.
03:30:05 I can't breathe.
03:30:06 I have to make this last move quick.
03:30:08 Shadow art.
03:30:09 Da kusuro.
03:30:13 Wait, what?
03:30:14 Oh.
03:30:15 I was in the kitchen.
03:30:16 I'm eating my ramen still.
03:30:17 Slurp.
03:30:18 Oh, the knives are coming out.
03:30:21 Oh.
03:30:22 Oh.
03:30:23 Haha.
03:30:24 Simsie grabs them.
03:30:28 He's so strong.
03:30:30 He's so strong and powerful.
03:30:33 Poof, poof, poof.
03:30:36 Slurp.
03:30:37 Wait, is this one flying towards me?
03:30:40 Munch, munch.
03:30:42 What's happening?
03:30:43 This is real good.
03:30:44 I wasn't paying attention.
03:30:45 What happened to the knife?
03:30:46 It looks like a pink hand.
03:30:48 Oh.
03:30:49 Yeah, something caught it.
03:30:53 Did you conjure an ethereal pink ghost hand?
03:30:56 Oh, it's the Rayman.
03:31:00 My stand is Rayman because it's a platformer.
03:31:03 I forgot the name.
03:31:05 He jumped over the counter and what then?
03:31:07 I melted the floor and he fell.
03:31:09 I used my stand to remove the oxygen molecules from the air.
03:31:12 I made sure he'd end up unconscious one way or another.
03:31:16 Oh, wait, that's your line.
03:31:18 Okay.
03:31:19 Okay.
03:31:20 Okay.
03:31:21 Okay.
03:31:22 I have my little green goo friend here.
03:31:28 He's looking.
03:31:29 Look, he's looking.
03:31:31 We're getting freaking burgers.
03:31:33 I can't trust Japanese food places.
03:31:35 Yeah, that's probably a safe bet.
03:31:37 Bloody hell, Ben.
03:31:39 Oh, good grief.
03:31:41 Fuck you, Ben.
03:31:43 That's insane.
03:31:45 I messed with the layers at the top and had to redo a lot,
03:31:48 but I got it out on time for the next ever hope.
03:31:50 Ben isn't too sick to read his lines.
03:31:53 Not anymore.
03:31:54 I'm mostly fine.
03:31:56 Hey, that was cool.
03:31:58 Yeah.
03:31:59 I like when I have powers.
03:32:03 Some of my little green.
03:32:06 I just like the little squat and you're just explaining.
03:32:09 I melted the floor and you fell.
03:32:11 I used my stand to remove the oxygen molecules from the air down there.
03:32:15 What is my little green guy?
03:32:17 Why does he have like four horns?
03:32:20 I don't know.
03:32:21 When was he first depicted?
03:32:23 I don't remember him looking.
03:32:26 I don't remember one that looked quite like this.
03:32:29 Just melts through the floor.
03:32:31 There's no oxygen.
03:32:34 It looks like it looks like he's in this one.
03:32:37 When I said brace yourselves, it looks like he is like extracting air
03:32:46 from through the floor like he's or something.
03:32:51 And that's what he's doing.
03:32:54 Oh, yeah.
03:32:55 I guess that the vapors is getting the vapors out of the underneath.
03:33:01 He's getting vaporized.
03:33:08 I'm just looking over again.
03:33:11 La Mal.
03:33:14 That was a quick read because there wasn't much dialogue.
03:33:19 But you know, action packed.
03:33:24 What was the Rayman thing?
03:33:26 Is it just hands?
03:33:30 My stand is a Rayman, but it's a Raywoman.
03:33:35 I vaguely remember.
03:33:37 Thanks, Vinny.
03:33:39 I love you.
03:33:41 OK.
03:33:42 Good.
03:33:43 Next one is a quick question from Prince Isolation 321 Go.
03:33:50 Hi.
03:33:51 So I was listening to the solo Ben cast commentary track, by the way,
03:33:55 please make another one.
03:33:56 There's a squeak wall right there whenever you get around to it.
03:34:01 I was listening to the commentary on the solo Ben cast and Ben said
03:34:05 there that y'all were thinking about maybe at some point doing a behind
03:34:10 the scenes on the OVA filming and or Radcon 4 and maybe subsequently
03:34:17 a commentary track on that.
03:34:19 And you know, I am just at this point a total slut for PCP content to listen
03:34:24 to at any point during work or whatever.
03:34:26 So, you know, is that still happening?
03:34:29 Should I look forward to that?
03:34:31 Is that shelved?
03:34:32 I asked Nate about it and apparently there really isn't much like behind
03:34:37 the scenes footage.
03:34:41 Right?
03:34:43 Well, I guess not.
03:34:46 We didn't film us coming up with anything.
03:34:48 It's just sort of like outtakes and seconds before we said action.
03:34:54 That's all that would be filmed during that time.
03:34:57 Yeah.
03:34:58 The OVA, I mean, I guess I could go through all of the footage and see,
03:35:04 but pretty much all the footage from the OVA is like, yeah,
03:35:08 it's just the shots that we used in that Nate used in the final thing.
03:35:14 I think the in terms of commentary, we already did a commentary on the OVA,
03:35:19 which includes as much behind the scenes stuff as we remember.
03:35:23 I think.
03:35:24 Yeah.
03:35:25 That's why I'm thinking behind the scenes would just be extra footage.
03:35:28 I just don't know if there really is any.
03:35:30 I mean, I have all the footage.
03:35:31 I saved it on a second hard drive.
03:35:34 I could go through it, but it's funny.
03:35:37 It's all in like one minute long cuts.
03:35:40 There's not like none of it is like long.
03:35:45 Honestly, maybe we should have just filmed it all in one long thing and then chopped it up.
03:35:48 Maybe it would have been nice to get a bunch of like behind the scenes footage of us just fucking around.
03:35:53 Yeah, I think we were just very, we were very like hectic on that day.
03:35:58 Like we got a, we got a, you know, next scene, next scene.
03:36:02 I think when some people were filming, the rest of us were just lounging around for like,
03:36:08 we weren't in the shot, but we weren't filming that, I guess,
03:36:12 because we didn't have our cameras with us because it gets sandy if we had to put them down.
03:36:18 And we weren't wearing clothings.
03:36:19 We couldn't put them in in like pockets.
03:36:22 We were wearing bikinis.
03:36:24 Right.
03:36:26 We, I suppose I could take all that footage and put all the original footage in a timeline and see like how long is it.
03:36:35 And maybe there is extra stuff in there.
03:36:37 I would, I would have to, I would have to go through it and see.
03:36:43 Maybe, I don't know.
03:36:46 If I, if I found any interesting bits of like, oh, this is, this is us just like fooling around that wasn't in the OVA.
03:36:54 I mean, yeah, if there was a significant amount of that, yeah, I would be fine with publishing it,
03:37:00 maybe as a bonus content of some kind.
03:37:03 I just, I just have to see.
03:37:05 That's all.
03:37:06 Okay.
03:37:07 Next one.
03:37:08 I think, you know, I might, I might take a look at some point.
03:37:11 Good, good question.
03:37:12 Next one is called Ben Speaks.
03:37:14 Oh, and it is just a image.
03:37:17 It's an image of chat GBT.
03:37:19 Uh-oh.
03:37:21 Not another one.
03:37:24 Not again.
03:37:26 I am Ben Saint.
03:37:28 I'm visible on your timeline, but if I can help it, I am invisible to you until it's too late.
03:37:33 I know where you live.
03:37:34 And guess what?
03:37:35 I live there too.
03:37:36 I hover around all of you.
03:37:37 I know no color barrier, no religion, no morality, no currency.
03:37:41 I speak your language fluently.
03:37:43 And with every voice I take away, I acquire yet another language.
03:37:46 I work very quickly.
03:37:48 I work faster than pediatric aids, cancer and diabetes combined.
03:37:53 If you have any patrons, I make sure that your Patreon fails.
03:37:56 Your money will fall into my hands and I will bankrupt you for my own self-gain.
03:38:00 I don't sleep, so I make sure you don't either.
03:38:03 I will make it virtually impossible for your followers to engage, to converse or support you without a struggle, without embarrassment, without pain.
03:38:09 You have no care for me.
03:38:10 Your scientists don't have the resources and I relish their desperation.
03:38:13 Your oomphies are happy to pretend that I don't exist, of course, until it's their turn.
03:38:18 I am Ben Saint.
03:38:19 I have no interest in right or wrong.
03:38:21 I derive great pleasure out of your loneliness.
03:38:24 I will fight to take away your hope.
03:38:26 I will plot to rob you of your clout and your dreams.
03:38:29 I will make sure that every day you wake until you cry, wondering who will take care of my content after I die.
03:38:35 The truth is, I am still winning and you are scared and you should be.
03:38:39 I am Ben Saint.
03:38:40 You ignored me.
03:38:41 That was a mistake.
03:38:43 True.
03:38:45 I like that you ignored me at the end like somebody who's just successfully getting you and this is your response.
03:38:52 This is my unhinged like Twitter reply that's already, I've already been blocked.
03:39:04 I wonder, I wonder how they got it to.
03:39:07 I wonder if they told ChatGPT, hey ChatGPT, imagine a character.
03:39:11 His name is Ben Saint.
03:39:13 He is a content creator.
03:39:16 He is an unknown content creator who is spiteful and who wants to destroy other people's success online.
03:39:24 Write me a poem in, write me a non rhyming poem.
03:39:28 Write me a manifesto in the character of Ben Saint explaining what he will do to you.
03:39:34 Yeah.
03:39:35 I can imagine a lot of this is very specific and you're not that prominent of a person that ChatGPT would just know these things.
03:39:43 No, they would have to.
03:39:44 I mean, ChatGPT thinks that I'm the creator of the Munchie Minute.
03:39:54 Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading that.
03:39:58 Let's see if we got any last minute voicemails.
03:40:00 Oh my God.
03:40:01 Yeah, there's three more in the last five minutes.
03:40:07 How to pronounce Ben Saint.
03:40:09 Okay, it's a Vokeroo link.
03:40:13 You ready?
03:40:17 How to pronounce Ben Saint.
03:40:18 That's another one.

03:41:10 You are bent now.
03:41:12 Bint, bent, bent, bent, bent.
03:41:14 It can't say Bint that many times.
03:41:17 He can't, he can't get away with it.
03:41:20 Bint is like a slang for like prostitute.
03:41:23 Is it?
03:41:24 Yeah.
03:41:25 Oh my god.
03:41:26 How could he say that?

03:41:50 And one last one.

03:41:55 Okay, three, two, one, go.
03:41:57 Well, hello, guys.
03:41:58 Welcome back to my journey through the PCP Patreon backlog.
03:42:03 I'm just here to say, coming right at you from the voicemail roundup episode.
03:42:09 Fuck, why were all these things cut?
03:42:13 You know, why were all these little gems, these little diamonds in the rough,
03:42:17 cut from the fucking beautiful podium that they rightfully deserve?
03:42:22 You know, for all of his centrism, for all of his enlightened fence writing,
03:42:27 Nate sure was a fucking fascist.
03:42:32 Okay.
03:42:35 Is that all right?
03:42:36 Is he cut himself off?
03:42:38 I, I guess.
03:42:42 Well, I don't know what he's, I don't know exactly what he's referring to.
03:42:46 Uh, to the voicemail episode, the bonus one, where we went through as many bo-
03:42:52 Oh, oh, oh, oh, why he didn't hear it when he cut all the voicemails.
03:42:56 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:42:57 He didn't play them on the show.
03:42:59 I see, I see.
03:43:00 Yeah, yeah, he hates the freedom, he hates freedom of speech.
03:43:03 He hates freedom of speech.
03:43:04 Yeah, that's true.
03:43:05 That's true.
03:43:06 That's why he didn't play them.
03:43:11 We've cut them for you, dear viewer, to pay money to have us listen to them
03:43:17 for your entertainment.
03:43:22 Right?
03:43:27 Uh, incorrect.
03:43:29 Okay.
03:43:30 Uh, I actually have, uh, I think I actually have like two bonus episodes
03:43:35 that Ellie is our edited and gave me and that I just haven't uploaded yet.
03:43:39 Uh, so I should do that.
03:43:40 Yeah.
03:43:41 Oops.
03:43:41 Uh, I think I have, I think there's two.
03:43:44 There was like one from last month and he just gave me one like this past week.
03:43:48 Uh, I'll get those up soon.
03:43:50 Patreon.com, slash the procrastinators for that.
03:43:54 And, uh, the commentary, the, the, the, the rad con OVA commentary is pretty good.
03:44:01 I think people will like that.
03:44:03 Um, okay.
03:44:05 Well, that's about it.
03:44:06 Let's cut it.
03:44:07 I'm going to go, I'm going to try and use the rest of my day to, uh, get that
03:44:11 Biscopades done and, uh, you know, move on, take steps towards actually getting
03:44:17 that, that, that perfect comic party out here.
03:44:19 It's coming soon.
03:44:20 It's going to be, it's going to be ready before we even know it.
03:44:23 Yeah.
03:44:24 I'm going to go to bed.
03:44:26 I guess it's late for you.
03:44:28 It's 12 58.
03:44:30 That's okay.
03:44:31 Not so bad.
03:44:33 All right.
03:44:33 Well, um, um, the, the, bye.
03:44:38 Bye.
03:44:39 End of the episode.
03:44:40 See you next week.
