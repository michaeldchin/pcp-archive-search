00:00:00 Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint, introing for the first time and I got it's such a rush. It's such an adrenaline rush. I can't believe it. I've made it. I made it dad. I'm here and I'm queer and get used to it. And I'm here with Digibro is also here.
00:00:27 Oh man, I just like moved my beer and it made my mic fall over and I didn't realize it was resting on my beer.
00:00:33 Oh yeah, and I'm here with Nate Best Guy Ever Bestman.
00:00:37 Oh man, I just moved my tea and it slightly jostled my microphone arm. What a conundrum this is.
00:00:44 Whoa boy, and there's also The Davoo here. The Davoo from Saturn goes to Saturn.
00:00:51 And whoa, we got fucking Hippocrit here. He's a fucking Hippo boy. He's on the show.
00:00:58 It's an honor to finally be on the show.
00:01:02 Yeah, all right. We're here and we're talking about, hey, let's talk about how we all just went to the fucking movies together.
00:01:11 Like a bunch of cool, oh wait, nobody else is here. Nobody else is here.
00:01:15 Did you go with you? I'm here. I was there.
00:01:17 Yeah, it's only Digi.
00:01:19 I can speak for Tom because I know the entire experience he had as I drove him as he now lives with me.
00:01:26 Let me quickly look up the Urban Dictionary definition of going to the movies.
00:01:30 Yeah, sure. Urban Dictionary of going, Urban Dictionary of two, and Urban Dictionary of the.
00:01:37 Just add a plus between those and you got it.
00:01:39 And I've just returned back from the harrowing adventure of riding the fucking bus. What a shit show.
00:01:48 Tell us about your bus woes.
00:01:50 Ben, I didn't even think you lived that far out of like the center of Boston that it would take like an hour and a half, almost two hours.
00:01:57 And I should have probably just gone with my normal route, but I decided to look up the fastest route on my phone,
00:02:03 which had me jump three different buses, which would have gotten me home fast because I wouldn't have had to like wait hardly at all.
00:02:09 Only one of those buses ran late and missed its connection, so I ended up having to wait around.
00:02:15 So yeah, normally to get into the city, I just have to take the red line and then a quick bus ride to Harvard or Davis Square,
00:02:24 which is pretty, it's pretty convenient, but I didn't do that.
00:02:28 How long would that normally take though?
00:02:30 If I, if I time it so I leave like it exactly when I need to be like, like, like so that I'm not waiting for the bus,
00:02:38 like half an hour, 35, 40 minutes tops.
00:02:42 Public transportation, ladies and gentlemen.
00:02:44 What the hell are you going to do?
00:02:46 I love public transportation. I am so, I am so overjoyed every day of my life.
00:02:50 Every day of my life, I look up at the stars and I say, thank you, God, that you didn't curse me,
00:02:55 that you didn't curse me with the modern leprosy that is automobile ownership.
00:03:01 Ben, do you remember, do you remember when we were young and we missed the bus?
00:03:07 There's no public transportation. What we would have to do to get to school, we would have to call a taxi service to dispatch a taxi to us.
00:03:16 I mean, our dad did it so that we'd like learn a lesson.
00:03:18 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:19 We could have driven us, but like he wanted us to learn.
00:03:21 Our parents made us do it mostly out of spite.
00:03:23 Well, it was not spite, it was just so we'd learn, dammit, and I learned, dammit.
00:03:28 Tomato tomato.
00:03:29 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:30 I remember one time, one time I missed the bus.
00:03:33 Expensive too.
00:03:34 Yeah, and this was the worst, but also it was a little heartwarming at the end.
00:03:39 Oh, shit, spoilers.
00:03:40 Okay.
00:03:41 So yeah, I missed the bus and I think dad was like, I think I had missed the bus like not long before and dad was pissed that I had missed it like twice in a row.
00:03:50 So he was like, you know, get a fucking taxi.
00:03:52 I was like, okay.
00:03:53 So I call the taxi service and I get in and the thing is I, at this point in my life, I was not driving.
00:03:58 So I did not really know the way to the school like by car.
00:04:03 So I get in the taxi and the guy starts driving me and he asks me where the school is and I tell him I'm not sure,
00:04:09 but I try to give him directions as best I can and I fail and we take multiple wrong turns and we end up driving for like an hour.
00:04:17 School is like, what, 20 minutes away?
00:04:19 Yeah, something like that.
00:04:20 Yeah, so we drive for like an hour and the bill is like $40 at the end.
00:04:23 It's like way more than it should have been.
00:04:25 He could have just looked it up.
00:04:26 He could have just looked it up and I don't even have $40 on me.
00:04:29 So we get to the school and he's, he even got mad at me one point.
00:04:32 He's like, where's this fucking school, dude?
00:04:34 Cause like, I don't know why he was mad though because his plan was then to charge me for the whole ride, which he did.
00:04:39 We get to the school and he's like, okay, that'll be like 40 bucks.
00:04:42 And I'm like, well, shit, I don't have 40 bucks on me.
00:04:45 It wasn't supposed to be that much.
00:04:47 And he's like, all right, listen, I'll take what you got on you right now and then I'll come to your house when you're out of school.
00:04:53 I'll come to your house after school and collect the rest.
00:04:56 And I'm like, uh, okay.
00:04:59 Little baby Ben's first experience with debt.
00:05:01 Yeah, we'll come in and break your legs.
00:05:04 Probably like 16, 17, I'm going to say 17.
00:05:09 So, but anyway, long story short, I get home and it turns out that he did come to our house, but he met our parents and apparently our parents told him to fuck off because, uh,
00:05:20 Excellent.
00:05:21 Yeah, so I did not.
00:05:22 Yeah, yeah.
00:05:23 So I was, so in the end, I got that's the heartwarming.
00:05:25 Yeah.
00:05:26 He deserves to get told to get some money.
00:05:34 This was before Uber, by the way, for anyone that doesn't know what a taxi is.
00:05:39 I was recently in other countries known as Europe and I was, I usually loved public transportation because it's like, you know,
00:05:52 That from my house, I can walk to the train station.
00:05:54 I can go anywhere in London.
00:05:56 I want at all through the trains.
00:05:58 And that's, that's cool.
00:06:00 Um, but I was in like Switzerland, I think, and I had to like, I was going to this film festival on short notice.
00:06:08 It was, it was a secret, secret project.
00:06:10 Don't, don't worry about it.
00:06:11 Um, so I was going to your folks.
00:06:13 Damn.
00:06:14 Um, I talk about it on my Patreon podcast.
00:06:16 Okay, subscribe.
00:06:18 Yeah, I'm behind.
00:06:19 I'm behind on the, on the pay, on the pay podcast for the Hippocrates.
00:06:23 Me too.
00:06:24 Yeah.
00:06:25 So we all Hippo patrons?
00:06:26 Not me.
00:06:27 Never.
00:06:28 Bitch.
00:06:29 Anyway, um, I mean, I'm in Switzerland and I'm freaking out because I'm scared of different people to me.
00:06:35 And so, and I don't know the language and they don't care about me and it's really late.
00:06:40 And so I'm like, okay, I need to get from Switzerland to France.
00:06:46 Um, because the only airport that's close by is in Switzerland.
00:06:49 There's like, you've got to go over the border, uh, through a coach.
00:06:53 And I'm like, how do I, how do I do this?
00:06:57 I didn't have enough time to like research it beforehand.
00:07:00 So I was fumbling around in Switzerland looking at like the train like things and there was no people around.
00:07:05 I had to like smash on, on, on the like little ticket, uh, you know, dispensers.
00:07:11 Oh.
00:07:12 And it wouldn't go to the place I wanted to go.
00:07:14 So I couldn't get the train.
00:07:16 Was it in English?
00:07:17 Was it in English?
00:07:18 There was an English option, but it just wouldn't go to the place I wanted to go to.
00:07:22 Dude, this is literally like watching someone go through Valley of the Drinks with two flasks.
00:07:27 Like, oh my God.
00:07:28 Yeah, it was like the most unprepared I'd ever been.
00:07:31 And at this, in this moment, I was like, public transport is the worst thing of all time.
00:07:36 It doesn't, it doesn't cater to me.
00:07:38 A weirdo foreigner who had not looked up where to go and how to get there beforehand.
00:07:44 Anyway, I, I ended up having to get a taxi, which was like a 45 minute taxi.
00:07:49 To France from Switzerland?
00:07:51 Yeah, just, just across the border.
00:07:53 It's like near the Alps, like little, little border thing there.
00:07:56 And I get the, I think...
00:07:58 Countries are really small over there.
00:08:00 Yeah.
00:08:01 Those are pretty decent size.
00:08:02 I get the, I get the taxi and he's like, yeah, yeah, just, just get in there.
00:08:06 It was really funny having him like fail at trying to like use his like Google voice recognition to input the town that I wanted.
00:08:17 It's just funny to see that French people, Swiss people, they have, they have funny problems just like us, just like real people.
00:08:26 Hard to believe.
00:08:28 It's like being British and then describing going to Europe.
00:08:33 But I guess ever since Brexit, we can, and Yuri Hirasawa's opinion, I guess that basically passes now.
00:08:39 Well, it's like, it's like being Chinese, it's like being Japanese and going to the mainland.
00:08:43 Yeah, I guess that's true. I guess that's true.
00:08:45 Yeah.
00:08:46 I can only relate to things through Japanese.
00:08:49 The scary ending of public transport and the fact that I had to get a taxi is that it was like 200 euros.
00:08:55 And the guy turned around to me when he got there.
00:08:58 That's like $10,000.
00:09:00 Yeah. And he, and he's like, you know, 200 or something.
00:09:05 And I was like, okay, here's my car.
00:09:07 And he said, oh, we don't, don't take car.
00:09:10 I'm a taxi.
00:09:11 And I didn't have Europe money.
00:09:14 I didn't expect to be using Europe money.
00:09:16 I was expecting to be using a train.
00:09:18 I was expecting to be using my funny car to, to, to beep on like, like public transport.
00:09:22 You, you beep your card. It works everywhere.
00:09:25 It was very stressful.
00:09:27 So how'd you get out of that predicament?
00:09:29 I ran. No, I, he took my card and he did some weird thing.
00:09:33 And then I got an email saying money has been taken.
00:09:36 And I was like, oh, okay.
00:09:37 Oh, all right.
00:09:38 So you still had to pay 200?
00:09:39 I think it was like, he doesn't like, this is a thing in Europe that I've noticed a lot of times when I didn't have cash.
00:09:46 They really don't like, like using cards because they can't, you know, if it's cash, then, you know, you can't, the government doesn't know that you have the money.
00:09:57 Oh, sneaky, sneaky is not on record.
00:10:00 So they can do something with it.
00:10:02 They can be sneaky taxes.
00:10:04 Because when you, when you run a credit card, there is a charge.
00:10:07 That's why like most small businesses will have like a three or $5 minimum and all that.
00:10:12 But like specifically in Europe, people are very, very cash only please all the time.
00:10:18 To fill your hands with coins during the smallest of exchanges.
00:10:22 Like that, like, like in, like in David Lynch cooking quinoa.
00:10:26 Yeah, David Lynch cooking quinoa.
00:10:28 It's not uncommon for that to happen in America, but only if it's like places run by foreigners.
00:10:34 That's true.
00:10:35 There's a burger place, it's run by fucking Americans, but it's small and it's frustrating.
00:10:40 It's fucking small business quirks are kind of infuriating.
00:10:45 Wait, wait, you're talking about Burger King small business quirks?
00:10:48 No, I said Burger King.
00:10:49 Yeah.
00:10:50 Hippo's memes became reality.
00:10:52 But Yovoo, I don't even work at Burger King.
00:10:57 There it is, there it is.
00:10:59 Yeah, memes, meme count one.
00:11:01 Can we get an air horn?
00:11:02 Can we get a fucking soundboard?
00:11:04 It's all fucking quaint and quirky that they have like fucking like dish towels hung up on the side.
00:11:11 That they have like these weird names like the farm hand, which is a hamburger with ranch on it.
00:11:16 It's all nice and quirky.
00:11:18 And that you're in a building that's from the 50s until like you're sitting down waiting for your order
00:11:24 and then the lady goes, oh yeah, by the way, cash only.
00:11:28 And it's like, goodbye.
00:11:30 I don't understand how they don't just put that on the fucking door of the place.
00:11:35 I believe they like...
00:11:36 I mean, I know they post it somewhere, but never prominently enough.
00:11:40 There should be a picture of like an old family from the 1800s saying this must be you.
00:11:45 And so, and like, you know, the fucking, you know, Cole brought me over there because she was so excited about it.
00:11:50 And she didn't even remember that part, packed.
00:11:52 Well, that's confirmation bias because you're only remembering the times that you failed to notice it.
00:11:57 So those times they failed to post it prominently.
00:12:01 We show up like a month later, this time with Cash Ready, and you know, we got the food just barely in time.
00:12:06 We got there just before closing at 5.30.
00:12:10 It's a fucking restaurant that closes at 6.
00:12:15 On which day of the week was this?
00:12:17 I think it was just a weekday.
00:12:18 I mean, if it's a lunch place, that's probably reasonable.
00:12:20 Maybe on a Sunday where things like close early.
00:12:23 I don't know.
00:12:24 Fucking Kevin's Doghouse.
00:12:26 As much as I love Kevin's Doghouse, and I promoted it so much online,
00:12:30 that place had the shittest hours in the universe because they were like closed on two days of the week, I think,
00:12:37 and they opened at like 11 a.m. and closed at 3 p.m.
00:12:41 But then if they didn't have enough customers, they would just close like an entire hour early just because they're like,
00:12:46 ah, well, nobody's showing up.
00:12:48 And then me and Victor would get there at like 2.30 and be like, mother fucker!
00:12:52 It's like a 15 minute drive, so it would be frustrating.
00:12:57 One of the least appealing...
00:12:59 Oh, sorry, you can go.
00:13:00 This was really funny.
00:13:01 It was really cathartic.
00:13:02 No, not cathartic.
00:13:03 It was hilarious.
00:13:04 I don't know what the fuck it was.
00:13:05 To be sitting there, we sat outside the store because they closed,
00:13:08 so it's like, okay, shit, we gotta stand outside at the benches that are outside.
00:13:12 Eating our hamburgers, 6 o'clock happens, the store closes,
00:13:15 and we watch like half a dozen vehicles pull into the drive-thru,
00:13:20 and the lady who's like cleaning up like gives them the no signal,
00:13:24 and they have to like drive away and being like, yeah,
00:13:26 maybe don't fucking open a restaurant and close at 6 on a weekday, you morons.
00:13:32 Like what?
00:13:33 One of the least appealing cities I've ever been to was Richmond, Virginia.
00:13:38 And I would only be there for a little bit, like I would stop there between buses and trains and shit,
00:13:44 and sometimes I would walk around.
00:13:46 Incidentally, the worst place I've ever lived, Richmond, Virginia.
00:13:49 Yeah, cool.
00:13:50 Home of the Confederacy, right?
00:13:52 Right?
00:13:53 One of several, probably.
00:13:55 It's around there.
00:13:56 That's one point in its favor.
00:13:58 So, I mean, first of all, the whole thing is a rusted, concrete nightmare,
00:14:03 like the downtown area.
00:14:06 It's hideous.
00:14:07 And second of all, I walked around for like an hour on a Saturday,
00:14:10 and I went into like, you know, stores that normally sold food,
00:14:14 and like all the restaurants were closed on Saturday,
00:14:17 like in the middle of the day on Saturday.
00:14:19 There's a lot of Jews around there.
00:14:21 I doubt it.
00:14:23 Frankly, I doubt it.
00:14:24 Okay.
00:14:25 But yeah, everything was closed in the middle of the day on Saturday,
00:14:28 like convenience stores, like they were that normally would cook food,
00:14:32 their grills were off, they were no longer, they were not cooking,
00:14:35 because like there's just nobody around, nobody, no business on Saturdays.
00:14:39 No business on Saturdays.
00:14:40 Which is the opposite of what you would think.
00:14:42 Yeah, like if you think one day they were going to operate, it would be then.
00:14:45 Is there some sort of siesta going on, like across town?
00:14:48 No, I asked the guy, because I was like, hey, are you cooking food?
00:14:52 And they're like, no, the grill's off.
00:14:53 And I was like, why is everything closed?
00:14:55 And he's like, there's just no business on Saturdays.
00:14:57 So I was like, well, this city must be in a bad way.
00:15:00 Must be in a bad way.
00:15:01 Must be the internet.
00:15:02 Everyone's ordering their burgers online now.
00:15:04 I guess so.
00:15:05 Ben, I'm gonna ask, what was the total cost of your travel
00:15:08 to and from the theater today?
00:15:15 It would have been less if I had taken the normal route.
00:15:19 It was maybe like $7 or $8?
00:15:24 Okay, so next time, I think as of you saying that just now,
00:15:29 I am never driving into Boston again.
00:15:32 Did you have to pay to park?
00:15:34 I always have to pay to park.
00:15:36 Yeah, that's where the, yeah, no.
00:15:38 And I never think about it.
00:15:39 Don't do it.
00:15:40 Because what happens is I look up the amount of time it will take,
00:15:45 and I think, oh, well, I have a car, so I can just drive in.
00:15:49 It'll only be half an hour, as opposed to 45 minutes to an hour.
00:15:53 And then I never, until I get there, do I remember, oh yeah,
00:15:56 I'm gonna have to pay for parking if this is anywhere exciting.
00:15:59 And the way they structure the hours everywhere in Boston is fucked,
00:16:05 because it's basically like zero, it'll be like 15 minutes is the lowest amount,
00:16:13 and that'll be like $10, and then it'll be like 15 to 30 minutes,
00:16:17 30 to an hour, an hour to an hour and a half,
00:16:20 an hour and a half to two, two to two and a half,
00:16:23 and then if it's after two and a half, it's just like some astronomical amount.
00:16:26 Who's gonna park for 15 minutes?
00:16:28 I know, I know.
00:16:29 Who's got the kind of business to be done?
00:16:32 And a parking lot that's built into a movie theater.
00:16:37 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:16:39 So we had all said that we were gonna show up at the theater,
00:16:44 the movie was at $12.55, so we were like, let's all show up at $12.30.
00:16:48 I get there at $12.34, and it's like, if you're under two hours,
00:16:54 the maximum that they charge you is $14,
00:16:57 but as soon as you're over two and a half hours,
00:17:00 it's just a flat $28 for the rest of the day, or $24 or something like that.
00:17:05 So of course, I'm like, well, we've showed up 30 minutes early,
00:17:09 and it's a two hour, like, you know, two hour, 10 minute movie,
00:17:12 so yeah, I had to pay.
00:17:14 That's why the PCP is recording quite late today,
00:17:18 because once I had cleared that two and a half hours,
00:17:22 I was like, well, we're in town, I'm not gonna fucking leave
00:17:25 and spend $28 without getting some food with my friends here,
00:17:29 so yeah, that was the logic.
00:17:31 I guess this is like, it's a fucking,
00:17:33 I've never done a lot of city living myself,
00:17:36 but you're really just paying for the convenience of having a car
00:17:39 and being able to drive it around the city,
00:17:41 they're trying to discourage that, it almost seems like.
00:17:43 It's not even, yeah, and it's not worth it,
00:17:45 because part of why we got our house where we did
00:17:49 is that it is within reach of public transit.
00:17:52 We deliberately didn't refuse to get a place
00:17:55 that was too far away to make it into the city.
00:17:58 It's just that I've never used public transit in my life,
00:18:01 because this is the first time I've lived anywhere that has
00:18:03 even remotely reasonable public transit,
00:18:06 so I'm not used to it.
00:18:08 There's nothing better than living on the red line.
00:18:10 You live on the red line, you're all set.
00:18:12 Yeah, we live on the red line.
00:18:13 While we're on this public transportation,
00:18:15 the only experiences I'd ever had with public transportation,
00:18:17 because Ben and I grew up in a rural area
00:18:19 where there was nothing there,
00:18:21 and then when I moved, when I went to college in New Jersey,
00:18:24 there were trains and buses,
00:18:26 but I would only use them when absolutely necessary,
00:18:30 and it seemed extremely poorly optimized,
00:18:32 and there weren't the kind of apps that there are today
00:18:34 that let you track buses, locations, and times and stuff,
00:18:37 which are a godsend for this kind of stuff,
00:18:39 because there have been so many times,
00:18:41 I've been just fucked by buses, just not showing up
00:18:43 when I was in college.
00:18:45 But when I was in Tokyo, it was just the end of my college days.
00:18:50 It was just a hard left turn
00:18:52 to just the greatest train system in the world,
00:18:54 and it was unbelievably great,
00:18:56 and Boston is also not too shabby at all.
00:18:59 Boston's amazing because it stops everywhere.
00:19:03 Every fucking 10 feet, there's another T stop,
00:19:06 and the thing is that in order to get to the T from my place,
00:19:11 I would have to drive two minutes to the place,
00:19:15 and so to me, it's like,
00:19:16 well, if I'm going to be using my car anyways,
00:19:18 why don't I just drive into the city?
00:19:20 And then, of course, I always forget how expensive parking is
00:19:24 until I get there.
00:19:25 And now, today, I am cutting that off.
00:19:28 I'm excising this cancer from my life.
00:19:30 All right.
00:19:31 Yes, yes.
00:19:32 I'm definitely addicted to the autonomy that my car gives me,
00:19:36 but I've also just got no other option.
00:19:38 I am too, but I use the car constantly in town,
00:19:42 and that's fine.
00:19:43 Like, where I live, which nobody please say,
00:19:46 but where I live is very dense and interconnected,
00:19:51 and using the car is like using the T in Boston.
00:19:55 It's so easy to get around with a car here that it's like,
00:19:58 it's fucking mega convenient.
00:20:00 But yeah, if you're going into Boston,
00:20:02 the thing is, even if you take public transit,
00:20:05 yeah, that takes longer,
00:20:06 but the traffic is always so fucked that even if you drive,
00:20:09 it's going to take just as long anyways,
00:20:11 because it's definitely going to take longer than it says it is.
00:20:14 One downside is that Boston closes kind of early,
00:20:17 and I think on most days, the T stops running around like one.
00:20:20 Like, I think of the last trains are like one, one, eight.
00:20:23 Oh, well, I'm not going to probably do much
00:20:25 that would keep me in Boston.
00:20:26 I wish they went later, but you know what, it's all right.
00:20:30 I mean, that just means like everything just closes at one,
00:20:32 because that's when the trains stop running.
00:20:35 As amazing as public transit is in Japan,
00:20:38 I think at like midnight, they fucking stop.
00:20:40 Yeah, they shut down at midnight and restarted 5 a.m.,
00:20:43 which is okay.
00:20:44 But you know what, speaking of public transit,
00:20:46 I just wanted to say my last thought on this
00:20:48 is that there's been some interesting developments
00:20:52 in Slime City.
00:20:53 Looks like some kind of transit system.
00:20:55 Yeah, New Los Angeles City, aka Neo Milwaukee.
00:20:57 Yeah, some kind of transit system.
00:20:59 Some kind of transit system has become back online,
00:21:01 and I'm really all interested.
00:21:03 Serving all your public transportation needs,
00:21:05 now you can go from West Glockesbury to Assault Beach,
00:21:09 or Assault Flats Beach Resort,
00:21:11 Lickety Split.
00:21:13 This has been a message from the
00:21:15 New Los Angeles City Board of Tourism.
00:21:17 Join my fucking Discord, assholes.
00:21:21 I can't wrap my little head around it.
00:21:24 It's too much.
00:21:26 There's too many chats,
00:21:28 and I don't know what to do.
00:21:30 Well, for you there are,
00:21:32 because if you're a mod,
00:21:34 if you have mod, then you see like all like 30 different,
00:21:37 all like 35 different zones.
00:21:39 But otherwise, you just see the one you're in,
00:21:42 and it's a little more manageable.
00:21:44 Sorry about that.
00:21:45 Whoever's editing this, could you edit out
00:21:47 that I said I'm the mayor?
00:21:49 I'm hypocrite.
00:21:50 I'm not the mayor of that place.
00:21:52 That's just a hearsay.
00:21:54 It's just a little dream of mine, actually.
00:21:56 There you go.
00:21:57 Is the mayor the same thing as the Lord of Ghosts?
00:21:59 Well, the Lord of Ghosts was elected mayor.
00:22:03 In a Democratic election that overturned the status quo,
00:22:07 and threw New Los Angeles City into a dark age
00:22:10 the likes of which have never been seen before.
00:22:12 That's true.
00:22:13 He got upgraded to the Lord Mayor of Ghosts.
00:22:16 Yes, yes.
00:22:17 Oh, that was cooler than being a Lord Mayor.
00:22:20 Much to all of our detriment.
00:22:22 Except for being a fewer president king.
00:22:24 A fewer president king, yeah.
00:22:26 Which is...
00:22:27 Ben, have you seen Full Metal Alchemist?
00:22:29 Yeah, yeah.
00:22:30 Do you remember that the guy...
00:22:31 The fewer king Bradley.
00:22:32 Yeah, but no, fewer president king Bradley,
00:22:36 except that King is just his first name.
00:22:38 Which is very confusing.
00:22:39 Wait, wait, wait.
00:22:40 I thought his title was Fear of King the whole time.
00:22:42 Okay, I knew his name was King.
00:22:44 I didn't know that he was...
00:22:45 How can you be a fewer and a president?
00:22:47 Those things are not the same.
00:22:48 His name is Fear of President King Bradley.
00:22:50 I don't remember him being president.
00:22:51 His name is King Bradley.
00:22:52 I remember him being Fear.
00:22:53 I remember him calling him Fear of King Bradley.
00:22:55 Well, this is in the Japanese version of Brotherhood, at least.
00:22:58 Okay, well, I watched the English dub of Not Brotherhood
00:23:01 of the original animated series.
00:23:03 And in that one, they just say Fear of King Bradley.
00:23:05 And I just thought his title was Fear of King,
00:23:07 which made perfect sense.
00:23:08 Frankly, I think you're fully shit, Digi.
00:23:10 I think that he's just Fear of King Bradley.
00:23:12 Well, I fucking remember the subtitles
00:23:15 and I was laughing every single time
00:23:17 I saw Fear of President King Bradley.
00:23:19 Ben, remember that boot?
00:23:20 Okay, way back in the day, Ben and I acquired
00:23:23 an illicit copy, an illicit copy
00:23:26 before all of FMA had come out in America.
00:23:28 I bought a DVD of...
00:23:30 It was like translated to Chinese
00:23:33 and then translated from Chinese to English
00:23:35 by a non-native English speaker.
00:23:37 It was incredible.
00:23:38 It was incredible.
00:23:39 No, you know what it is.
00:23:40 Those were always Babelfish.
00:23:42 Yeah, sure, sure.
00:23:44 Winry.
00:23:45 Somehow, the way that they transliterated Winry's name
00:23:48 had a fucking X in it.
00:23:50 Okay, that's true, but that wasn't even just it.
00:23:52 In every single episode,
00:23:54 Gluttony was Blatney.
00:23:56 That's how they translated that.
00:23:58 And Winry's name was different every episode.
00:24:00 It was a different name.
00:24:02 There's some mix of stuff going on here.
00:24:05 Okay, did it have the phrase Ohio State
00:24:08 in there randomly a whole bunch?
00:24:10 I don't remember.
00:24:12 When you translate the English word O, like OH,
00:24:16 through Babelfish back and forth,
00:24:18 it becomes Ohio State.
00:24:20 And one time I watched an illicit copy
00:24:23 of the Death Note Live Action movie,
00:24:25 and that kept popping up,
00:24:26 and that's how I knew it was Babelfish
00:24:28 that they used to translate it.
00:24:29 This was before I knew anything about computers and shit,
00:24:31 but I'm sure that it was what we're talking about.
00:24:33 There were online translations were done or something,
00:24:36 because there was all kinds of characters
00:24:38 stuck in there in weird places and stuff.
00:24:40 Did you buy this DVDs from one of these
00:24:43 random Chinatown stores?
00:24:46 This one was actually straight up from eBay.
00:24:48 This was from eBay, I remember buying it.
00:24:50 Did I guys ever tell you guys about
00:24:53 illegal and really weirdly fucked up DVDs
00:24:56 me and my family bought and watched
00:24:58 when we were in Africa?
00:25:00 Ooh, that sounds interesting,
00:25:02 but no, I don't think so.
00:25:04 Well, we drove into the city one time,
00:25:08 the city of Kampala in Uganda,
00:25:11 and fuck, the idea of really slow traffic,
00:25:14 really gassy air, went to a grocery store,
00:25:17 and when we get back to our car,
00:25:19 we're sort of like behind the store,
00:25:21 and there's a guy on a motorcycle
00:25:24 with a big like duffel bag type of thing
00:25:27 filled with those little paper sleeve DVDs.
00:25:32 Filled with them.
00:25:34 As far as I can tell, this is like 80%
00:25:36 of what the third world is.
00:25:38 It's just guys selling bootleg DVDs
00:25:40 behind stores.
00:25:42 Go on, go on.
00:25:44 The collection was comparable
00:25:47 to those Walmart $5 DVD bins,
00:25:49 where it's like, wow, it's a giant bin,
00:25:51 but the giantness of the bin is just to obfuscate
00:25:53 the fact that it's the same movies over and over again,
00:25:55 but there's more variety.
00:25:57 But what we started noticing, and again,
00:25:59 they were all in those like paper sleeves,
00:26:01 is that some of them had errors on the printing.
00:26:05 It's not like they were hand drawn.
00:26:07 They were actually like professionally printed.
00:26:09 They were just, okay, so, okay,
00:26:11 it had the mid-90s live action version
00:26:15 of Disney's 101 malations.
00:26:19 And it was the right font, malations.
00:26:24 Everything was correct.
00:26:26 The font was exactly as the actual poster is,
00:26:28 but it was just 101 malations.
00:26:31 Something hit on wrong.
00:26:33 We just assumed, okay, so every time there's a printing error,
00:26:36 they ship it to the third world, makes sense, right?
00:26:38 Yeah, okay.
00:26:40 How do you get that printing error?
00:26:42 How do you get an error where it's just the wrong letter?
00:26:44 I mean, one way is that you just have like foreigners,
00:26:48 people who don't speak English,
00:26:50 like hastily typing out these things
00:26:52 and just resell them quickly
00:26:54 on the black market in one day.
00:26:56 I imagine that these printings happen in like factories, right?
00:27:00 Don't they just mass produce the DVDs?
00:27:03 Like how the fuck are you...
00:27:05 That's a hell of a typo to me.
00:27:07 It's a shame that I didn't...
00:27:09 It's a hell of a thing not to spell check.
00:27:10 I never got on a podcast sooner
00:27:12 because I did, I know I've forgotten
00:27:14 about plenty of the typos that I saw,
00:27:16 but there's a lot of various things
00:27:19 about these disks that I remember.
00:27:21 So like we went home and started watching them
00:27:24 and I don't remember what movie it was
00:27:26 where we first saw this, but halfway through the movie,
00:27:30 like we just started seeing like black orbs
00:27:33 appear at the bottom of the screen,
00:27:35 like the movie was being eaten away.
00:27:37 Is this a creepypasta?
00:27:39 No, no, it's just it's people's heads in the theater.
00:27:41 Yeah, does Ben drown in this story?
00:27:43 There was live filmings of...
00:27:45 Yeah.
00:27:47 Were the black orbs hyper realistic?
00:27:49 It was just the shape of people's heads
00:27:51 because it was people's heads.
00:27:52 So that's the issue right there.
00:27:54 What had been done is these people had filmed theaters
00:27:56 with people, you know, these were secondhand filmings
00:27:59 and then they printed these sleeves
00:28:01 and put them on DVDs and sold them on mass.
00:28:03 Not all of them were like that.
00:28:05 Some of them were, some of them weren't.
00:28:07 It was really weird how that works.
00:28:09 I'm quite familiar with these because of the fact that
00:28:11 my dad, for whatever reason,
00:28:13 in spite of the fact that my dad was very
00:28:15 against us torrenting movies
00:28:17 because of it being illegal,
00:28:19 he nonetheless would buy
00:28:21 the vast majority of his movies from
00:28:23 a guy who would sell bootleg
00:28:25 movies out of the back of his car
00:28:27 and also bootleg suits.
00:28:29 This dude would just come to the dealership
00:28:31 my dad works at and just sell suits
00:28:33 and DVDs and just random stolen
00:28:35 and or bootleg shit.
00:28:37 And he would sell these for $3 a pop
00:28:39 and I'm like, Dad,
00:28:41 if you want to buy an illegal movie,
00:28:43 you can get it for free through torrenting
00:28:45 as opposed to paying $3 for it.
00:28:47 Is your dad just like, feels better
00:28:49 spending some amount of money as opposed to nothing?
00:28:51 Well, I just don't see it as untraceable.
00:28:53 Well, I just don't see it as untraceable.
00:28:55 So, it's interesting that
00:28:57 because like,
00:28:59 I mean, Dad's buying
00:29:01 illegal stuff but like
00:29:03 not having a problem with it because my dad
00:29:05 occasionally he would come
00:29:07 with like a hard drive
00:29:09 and he says he knows a guy
00:29:11 who I also know who he is.
00:29:13 He's not like a secret guy.
00:29:15 He's not even like a criminal.
00:29:17 He's just like a normal person and he's like
00:29:19 he'll just like have a
00:29:21 huge amount of like
00:29:23 newly released films
00:29:25 on a hard drive
00:29:27 or like a big lot of music.
00:29:29 You know, just give it to my dad
00:29:31 and you know, dad would be like, yeah,
00:29:33 got all these movies now.
00:29:35 He had a Plex account that he just has
00:29:37 like he had his own server and he would upload
00:29:39 like insane amounts of movies
00:29:41 and shows and shit to his
00:29:43 Plex server and then just give the
00:29:45 information to all of his friends
00:29:47 so we could all just access the server and watch
00:29:49 whatever. That's fascinating. It's pretty cool.
00:29:51 When I went to college, they had
00:29:53 like the thing in place where like we're on campus.
00:29:55 They shut it down so you can't torrent.
00:29:57 They like close that down. But what we did
00:29:59 have, I forget the name of it, there was
00:30:01 an in-house torrent or operation
00:30:03 running where on the local network
00:30:05 of the school, the College of New Jersey
00:30:07 FYI, it's been shut down
00:30:09 tragically now, but there was something
00:30:11 and I knew the people who were running it.
00:30:13 Wait, the college has or the network has?
00:30:15 Select students at the school
00:30:17 ran a network
00:30:19 on the school network.
00:30:21 There was a border set up so that you couldn't
00:30:23 torrent outside of
00:30:25 within the school, but what you could do
00:30:27 is someone could set up a server within that network
00:30:29 on the campus and then
00:30:31 people, if they had access to that thing
00:30:33 you could download from those people
00:30:35 and it always struck me similar to
00:30:37 the scan-lating crowd, it's like
00:30:39 who are these heroes
00:30:41 who just make it their hobby or their job
00:30:43 to make these things
00:30:45 accessible to the rest of us.
00:30:47 I was in a scan-lating group for a while.
00:30:51 Scan-lating is one thing.
00:30:53 People can't read that, you got to translate it.
00:30:55 But even beyond that, just these people
00:30:57 who want to just get movies
00:30:59 and just hold them on a hard drive
00:31:01 what's in it for them?
00:31:03 Being able to talk for my friend
00:31:05 Donsan being able to talk about the stuff.
00:31:07 Could I literally get pussy
00:31:09 by doing this? Is that what I want?
00:31:11 I think I could.
00:31:13 You easily could if that's what you're going for.
00:31:15 My friend Donsan was really into pussy.
00:31:17 He just wanted to talk about these movies
00:31:19 with his friends.
00:31:21 If you're in a community of
00:31:23 piraters or scan-laters or what have you
00:31:25 it's a thing.
00:31:27 It's the same reason people do the coordinate harassment online.
00:31:29 You accrue social capital
00:31:31 in whatever context
00:31:33 you're working in.
00:31:35 It gives you a fucking vain and cheap sense of purpose.
00:31:37 It's the same reason that people send death threats.
00:31:39 It's pretty comparable I'd say.
00:31:41 What?
00:31:43 I'm saying it's a pastime
00:31:45 like any other.
00:31:47 You spend your time in it with people
00:31:49 and you form bonds of camaraderie
00:31:51 and you build social capital and everyone
00:31:53 it's great.
00:31:55 It's just a way to
00:31:57 not just that but also for me
00:31:59 when I got into scan-lation
00:32:01 and I was just doing proof reading so like
00:32:03 basically
00:32:05 I don't know what that was about.
00:32:07 What he's trying to say is that
00:32:09 that same kind of social capital
00:32:11 is why people form hate groups online.
00:32:13 People on the internet
00:32:15 are bored and have no sense of purpose.
00:32:17 They'll do fucking anything that gives them affirmation.
00:32:19 You won't get any pussy at all
00:32:21 from just telling someone to kill themselves online.
00:32:23 Unless you've got a girl
00:32:25 sitting right next to you
00:32:27 and it's like a rape group
00:32:29 well
00:32:31 you know?
00:32:33 Do you mean a rape list
00:32:35 like on Dick's website?
00:32:37 Yeah.
00:32:39 Just maintain a rape list.
00:32:41 Yeah. That's true.
00:32:43 Turn my rape list guys. Here's the link.
00:32:45 By the way I did have more things to say about
00:32:47 Ugandan bootleg DVDs
00:32:49 but I don't know if it's that funny
00:32:51 but I don't know.
00:32:53 Go for it dude.
00:32:55 Just go for it.
00:32:57 What does that mean?
00:32:59 Well I guess
00:33:01 if you have a word document that at the top says
00:33:03 women to rape
00:33:05 is it too rape?
00:33:07 Is it have been raped?
00:33:09 What metrics
00:33:11 are we tracking?
00:33:13 I believe that the
00:33:15 8chan threading question literally just said
00:33:17 rape list and then just was pictures of women.
00:33:19 Well there you go.
00:33:21 There you go.
00:33:23 I don't know what a rape list exactly is
00:33:25 but we're going to find out
00:33:27 in this episode of the Procrastin's podcast.
00:33:29 Oh boy.
00:33:31 We're tackling the hard questions.
00:33:33 This one video game you
00:33:35 should not 100%
00:33:37 Incidentally
00:33:39 that guy who made the rape list eventually found
00:33:41 out about what it had caused and apologized to Dick.
00:33:43 Yeah I heard about that.
00:33:45 I heard about that.
00:33:47 Davoo tell us more about Ugandan Knuckles please.
00:33:49 Yeah.
00:33:51 Well
00:33:53 okay there is
00:33:55 for whatever reason
00:33:57 even though I've never actually seen all of
00:33:59 the Lion King from start to finish
00:34:01 I just never got the ground to it
00:34:03 more of I've seen the Lion King 2
00:34:05 for some reason we just decided to buy from this little
00:34:07 double bag the Lion King 3.
00:34:09 Oh okay.
00:34:11 Speaking of the Lion King
00:34:13 Speaking of the Lion King
00:34:15 today we were watching Princess Mononoke
00:34:17 and Kaze leans over to me and she's like
00:34:19 this song is exactly like that song from
00:34:21 the Lion King and I'm like
00:34:23 which song from the Lion King
00:34:25 and she's like
00:34:27 you know the Lion King
00:34:29 song and I'm like
00:34:31 so I don't know what she's talking about
00:34:33 so I say
00:34:35 I'm not that familiar with Lion King
00:34:37 it was my least favorite Disney movie as a kid
00:34:39 because I don't like animals
00:34:41 and she just stares at me and goes
00:34:43 fuck you
00:34:45 Wait what song was she talking about?
00:34:47 I don't know
00:34:49 I was thinking about
00:34:51 I was thinking about all the songs and Princess Mononoke
00:34:53 it was some background music
00:34:55 it was some background music
00:34:57 there might have been some background noise
00:34:59 I'm not sure
00:35:01 remember when Mufasa's ghost
00:35:03 comes and gives Simba guidance and shit
00:35:05 and there's all that mysterious
00:35:07 ambiance music and he's like I am your father
00:35:09 yeah there might be something there
00:35:11 same voice actor actually
00:35:13 Jamesville Jones that's right
00:35:15 I didn't even intend that
00:35:17 I was just saying that
00:35:19 so if you ever want to know
00:35:21 how the third movie after Princess Mononoke
00:35:23 Lion King 3 Return of Simba
00:35:25 we're in Africa
00:35:27 we're super bored we'll never find a way
00:35:29 we'll just watch some DVDs
00:35:31 this movie takes place in Africa
00:35:33 so it was probably pretty appropriate
00:35:35 you'll never find a Dway
00:35:37 here's what happened
00:35:39 we put in the movie
00:35:41 Memes Counter 2 Airhorn
00:35:43 we did it first
00:35:45 the Lion King 3 Return of Simba
00:35:47 uh oh
00:35:49 it's The Flower of Oz
00:35:51 which is a 2D animated movie
00:35:53 about the lion
00:35:55 the cowardly lion and his
00:35:57 side story before he found the yellow brick road
00:35:59 funnily enough I had actually seen that
00:36:01 movie before but it was well I guess I'm watching it again
00:36:03 so after I watched it
00:36:05 I can confirm that the Lion King 3 is not
00:36:07 a movie that exists
00:36:09 whoa that's fascinating
00:36:11 they had one and a half
00:36:13 there's Lion King 2 Simba's Pride
00:36:15 and then there's Lion King 1 and a half
00:36:17 I was going to say where did Simba go
00:36:19 that he needed to come back
00:36:21 apparently outside of North America
00:36:23 it is known as the Lion King 3 Hakuna Matata
00:36:25 oh okay
00:36:27 this was not called Hakuna Matata
00:36:29 it was advertised with like
00:36:31 you know um I think it was actually just
00:36:33 the uh the stuff that was
00:36:35 the Lion King 2 where it's like scars like
00:36:37 sun or whatever the fuck like that
00:36:39 so it's just the Lion King 2 that's what it was advertising
00:36:41 by the way just FYI that is
00:36:43 canonically not Scar's son
00:36:45 you know the guy who looks exactly like Scar
00:36:47 in every way and clearly should just be his son
00:36:49 canonically he is just another lion
00:36:51 no relation
00:36:53 don't worry it'll be tough when I tell you what happened
00:36:55 when we looked at the you know at the sleeve
00:36:57 so we're like okay so
00:36:59 the logo clearly says the Lion King 3
00:37:01 but then I look at it for like
00:37:03 more than a second and I realize
00:37:05 I mean I would have noticed this as an adult
00:37:07 probably but as a kid I didn't notice it
00:37:09 the actual cover art
00:37:11 is the Lion of Oz
00:37:13 it has the Cowardly Lion in 2D animation
00:37:15 and like the girl that he meets
00:37:17 and I'm like oh so it's
00:37:19 the Lion of Oz cover art but with the Lion King 3
00:37:21 logo
00:37:23 and then I flip it back right I look at the back
00:37:25 of the sleeve and it's got
00:37:27 um it's got like the new
00:37:29 Lion King 2 characters with that
00:37:31 okay I typed Lion of Oz
00:37:33 into Google and I completely
00:37:35 appreciate why this would be
00:37:37 mistaken for the Lion King
00:37:39 it looks like Simba he looks like Simba I can see him here
00:37:41 I mean he looks like Simba but also
00:37:43 kind of looks like the art style for that one
00:37:45 fucking animation that inspired the E meme
00:37:47 yeah I mean
00:37:49 the white lion or whatever his name is
00:37:51 I mean this is like
00:37:53 I mean yeah the fonts and the character design
00:37:55 this is like the equivalent of like
00:37:57 you know what's that company
00:37:59 that does all the like
00:38:01 the rib off what it is
00:38:03 rat a toying in little panda fighter
00:38:05 what do you mean like
00:38:07 I can't remember the name of that company
00:38:09 they did snakes on a train
00:38:11 oh god
00:38:13 and they also made Sharknado but like it's not
00:38:15 the asylum
00:38:17 that's a great people
00:38:19 but dude on the back of the sleeve
00:38:21 it shows like the new
00:38:23 the new young hipster
00:38:25 snake on a train
00:38:27 and the other
00:38:29 the other Lion King characters right
00:38:31 the back of the sleeve shows Lion King art
00:38:33 and it has a back of the blurb
00:38:35 right has like a blurb on the back
00:38:37 for the Lion King 3 right blurb says
00:38:39 what
00:38:41 happened to the cowardly lion
00:38:43 before he found the yellow brick road
00:38:45 and I was like oh
00:38:47 they just somehow
00:38:49 like
00:38:51 mashed up two different movies like completely
00:38:53 in every possible way
00:38:55 we also had this
00:38:57 we also had like a DVD this was like a DVD
00:38:59 in a plastic case for Cheaper by the Dozen
00:39:01 if you know that movie
00:39:03 is that the one with Steve Martin
00:39:05 yeah it was funny though
00:39:07 is that you know how like the back of DVDs
00:39:09 will have lots of symbols like the rating symbol
00:39:11 or like the MPAA symbol
00:39:13 this DVD just had like all the symbols on it
00:39:15 which row after row
00:39:17 after row after row of like every possible
00:39:19 symbol and it even had multiple
00:39:21 ratings it had an R rating
00:39:23 a PG rating and a G rating
00:39:25 and it was really weird
00:39:27 it depends on which subtitle track you chose
00:39:29 man there was lots of weird things
00:39:31 I probably could have like just made a whole podcast
00:39:33 just recounting these memories but
00:39:35 we also thought like these
00:39:37 hang on, hang on
00:39:39 did you just post an image and I have a problem
00:39:41 with it
00:39:43 we're not an image podcast you guys
00:39:45 Kermit is a frog
00:39:47 and then Fuzzy Bear is a bear
00:39:49 none of the three in the middle at the bottom there
00:39:51 they're not mouses
00:39:53 show notes link I guess
00:39:55 please
00:39:57 this reminds me of
00:39:59 a phenomenon that I don't know
00:40:01 if any of you will be familiar with
00:40:03 but are any of you familiar with a
00:40:05 genre I guess called
00:40:07 Pooh's Adventures of
00:40:09 what?
00:40:11 a genre of Pooh's Adventures
00:40:13 it is called Pooh's Adventures of
00:40:15 or Pooh's Adventures of X
00:40:17 and it is a
00:40:19 okay I think it was popular maybe
00:40:21 a decade ago or a little less
00:40:23 like it enjoyed a brief surge
00:40:25 like a weird surge in popularity of lots
00:40:27 of people doing it and like a little community
00:40:29 kind of like the fucking
00:40:31 pony analysis community it was like
00:40:33 this little niche community of people all doing
00:40:35 the same thing and what they were doing
00:40:37 was taking footage
00:40:39 from Winnie the Pooh
00:40:41 movies and splicing
00:40:43 them into other Disney movies
00:40:45 or games or like
00:40:47 footage from Disney World Rides or just anything
00:40:49 or
00:40:51 they didn't have to just be Pooh but mostly it was Pooh
00:40:53 whatever they would take these other characters
00:40:55 or Pooh characters and splice them into
00:40:57 other movies and make it a movie
00:40:59 about Pooh experiencing
00:41:01 the story of the Lion King
00:41:03 or Snow White
00:41:05 or like some fucking
00:41:07 point and click Disney CD-ROM adventure
00:41:09 or something
00:41:11 I want to see one of these
00:41:13 I will
00:41:15 how long would one of these be
00:41:17 like how long would this be
00:41:19 like the length of the full movie
00:41:21 but longer because there's Winnie the Pooh footage
00:41:23 who is in there
00:41:25 it's like a
00:41:27 Pooh character reacting to
00:41:29 anything
00:41:31 that happens
00:41:33 yeah
00:41:35 and it's like the idea is just
00:41:37 making it
00:41:39 yeah
00:41:41 this
00:41:43 no look this is a really deep
00:41:45 rabbit hole actually
00:41:47 and like it bears more
00:41:49 explaining
00:41:51 I can't do it justice on a podcast
00:41:53 there's a
00:41:55 there's more to it
00:41:57 there's more to it
00:41:59 there's wikis or there were wikis
00:42:01 where people where there would be
00:42:03 there were character lists
00:42:05 and people would have to basically
00:42:07 people would jockey for the
00:42:09 rights to use certain sets of
00:42:11 character and like two groups were not
00:42:13 allowed to use the same character like one
00:42:15 character would be claimed by one group
00:42:17 who is enforcing
00:42:19 the claims here
00:42:21 it's just a zeitgeist I guess
00:42:23 I googled Pooh's Adventures of
00:42:25 what I'm finding is like all these movie
00:42:27 covers and then like it's like a
00:42:29 Toy Story 3 cover and then just like
00:42:31 it is filled with like characters
00:42:33 from like other cartoon properties
00:42:35 like Pooh and I don't know
00:42:37 the fucking Looney Tunes and
00:42:39 Gronk you know
00:42:41 I don't
00:42:43 I'm pulling up the Pooh's Adventures wiki
00:42:45 oh my god there's like a hundred of them
00:42:47 oh no there's more
00:42:49 there's more like
00:42:51 I love me some way of the Pooh
00:42:53 how convincingly made are they
00:42:55 they're not like okay
00:42:57 like the Pooh
00:42:59 segments will just have no sound and just
00:43:01 have like some
00:43:03 badly fonted some badly
00:43:05 typeset text over it
00:43:07 are there any good ones
00:43:09 no it's sincere like
00:43:11 they'll take the silent Pooh footage
00:43:13 and put it in and put
00:43:15 some text at the bottom
00:43:17 giving them a new line as though
00:43:19 Pooh is saying like wow
00:43:21 Maleficent sure is a scary witch or something
00:43:23 you cannot be understated
00:43:25 when Nate said that it's like
00:43:27 movie posters with a shitload of characters
00:43:29 it's like a hundred characters every poster
00:43:31 I'm seeing Pooh's Adventures of Freddy
00:43:33 got fingered with like some
00:43:35 like Dr. Phil, Barney, Panty and Stockings
00:43:37 some of them are probably tongue and cheek
00:43:39 some of them are probably tongue and cheek
00:43:41 like especially the later ones
00:43:43 but many of them are sincere
00:43:45 this is fascinating
00:43:47 my question is Ben
00:43:49 are there any good ones
00:43:51 was anything good ever made
00:43:53 I will
00:43:55 there is this little cabal
00:43:57 or there was this little
00:43:59 cabal of four dudes
00:44:01 they were headed by this guy
00:44:03 called Benny the Beast
00:44:05 and there were a couple other ones
00:44:07 whose names escaped me
00:44:09 it doesn't matter
00:44:11 but they were called Lion King Heart Fantasy Films
00:44:13 and they evolved the format
00:44:15 much like
00:44:17 much like all of us evolved and grew
00:44:19 outside of the bounds of Pony Analysis
00:44:21 they too
00:44:23 these
00:44:25 sort of
00:44:27 these guys
00:44:29 they were doing Pooh's Adventures
00:44:31 and they would do other adventures
00:44:33 they did like a snow whatever
00:44:35 eventually they started inserting their OCs
00:44:37 into it as well
00:44:39 and then eventually
00:44:41 they started making movies that were just
00:44:43 about their OCs in other movies
00:44:45 are those good
00:44:47 no but they are more
00:44:49 interesting because these are like
00:44:51 these are like specific people
00:44:53 and I mean
00:44:55 okay I dug into this a while
00:44:57 back
00:44:59 and I had
00:45:01 okay
00:45:03 the saga of Lion King Heart
00:45:05 Fantasy Films is kind of
00:45:07 okay
00:45:09 I want to talk more
00:45:11 I want to talk more about it in the future
00:45:13 I feel like I'm not prepared to
00:45:15 a lot of info about it
00:45:17 Ben stop doing comics
00:45:19 stop doing physics
00:45:21 stop doing anything just become a full time
00:45:23 internet level six bottom of the iceberg
00:45:25 researcher and make of
00:45:27 lectures please
00:45:29 I would be happy with that
00:45:31 there are plenty of people who do that already
00:45:33 this is gonna
00:45:35 this will have to be in the show notes
00:45:37 this image I just shared because
00:45:39 I can't stop staring at it
00:45:41 it's blowing my fucking mind
00:45:43 so this is
00:45:45 Mintchi33's
00:45:47 Anti-Poo's Adventures
00:45:49 team
00:45:51 and it's just an image of
00:45:53 like 12 characters this person likes
00:45:55 but what's really fascinating about it
00:45:57 is that it's the most girl internet
00:45:59 thing I've ever seen
00:46:01 it's like all either
00:46:03 really obscure old western cartoons
00:46:05 or
00:46:07 some of it's like Winx Club and shit
00:46:09 and then there's like a bunch of pre-care characters
00:46:11 and a common writer character mixed in
00:46:13 and like
00:46:15 I just
00:46:17 I'm trying to picture
00:46:19 someone who even knows
00:46:21 this is exactly like that scene
00:46:23 in Tales gets trolled where they do the group pose
00:46:25 and they all get like the
00:46:27 the title like you shadow the awesome
00:46:29 the emo the annoying etc etc
00:46:31 that's what this is
00:46:33 I'm just really
00:46:35 I read that as the brain
00:46:37 that some one person has this set
00:46:39 of characters they like because it's so
00:46:41 weird and diverse
00:46:43 I mean this is just everything
00:46:45 from everything they've seen
00:46:47 this is a kid and this is all of their shows
00:46:49 I haven't even seen some of this stuff like what the hell is the damn
00:46:51 elephant thing from
00:46:53 Mumfy
00:46:55 I'm not familiar with Mumfy
00:46:57 Im not familiar with Pam
00:47:07 so in the middle
00:47:09 of the video
00:47:11 is this
00:47:13 one like
00:47:15 Akari Sakura
00:47:17 is apparently from JullBett
00:47:19 he's a long running
00:47:21 running little girls show that not a whole lot of people
00:47:23 know
00:47:25 Doesn't look like it's along the lines of like pre-cure and shit like it airs in that kind of time slot
00:47:30 So you oh wait no, I'm looking at common. You really should look
00:47:34 Right or I'm really curious
00:47:39 The common writer would probably be like she has a brother and she's seen common writer
00:47:46 I mean common writer wizard is yes, it's it's an entire series
00:47:50 He is the main character of common writer wizard, which was the the 2012 common writer show Wow
00:47:57 I wonder if this person
00:48:00 Like actually lives in ship because like common writer airs again in the same block as pre-cure
00:48:05 And I think Jullepet might be there too
00:48:07 So it's possible that she just like watches this whole block every morning. Also. Do you like that?
00:48:12 Do you like the fucking Cinderella is the stealth expert?
00:48:21 Appropriate at all
00:48:24 That like transformation is that the logic? I don't understand
00:48:28 Well, she has tiny feet. Oh for sneak in right?
00:48:31 No, she has tiny feet dude
00:48:33 That's why she wears tiny slippers that don't fit any of the other maidens and the king make sense make sense
00:48:39 Still and she's got her fairy godmother that can like turn vegetables into things for her. Yeah, that's good
00:48:45 Um, I don't have enough information about Vivian to figure out where she's from
00:48:50 I don't
00:48:54 Guys we're going down a rabbit hole here
00:48:56 I mean this talking about I mean I could we could probably go on a talk
00:49:00 We could probably go on to discuss poofs adventures of indefinitely. There's there's no shortage. That's true
00:49:07 There's just they're just they just never end
00:49:09 They just get better and better. Well speaking of crazy funny things that are very makes me laugh a lot
00:49:15 I have a topic to bring forth
00:49:18 I have just very recently
00:49:20 I would have said like within ten minutes of record the starting to record this episode
00:49:25 We had to wait a while as there's more like 40 minutes
00:49:28 But I just finished watching the very last episode of Tim and Eric's awesome show. Oh hell. Yes hell
00:49:33 Yes, even I haven't watched every episode. That's awesome. I
00:49:37 Enjoy Tim and Eric. It's good. They make me laugh. Have you seen the billion dollar movie? Oh
00:49:43 I haven't yet. Oh, that's the billion dollar movie. They're like to
00:49:48 Horses
00:49:51 Running in the way
00:49:54 Always thought about keg and phantom when I heard two horses. There's still time. There's still time horses
00:50:01 The thing I haven't actually got yeah, we got to work that in soon soon work that into the max revive agreed
00:50:06 But like I was I was watching it and it's like some parts aren't that funny some parts don't really land
00:50:12 That's like all of it really gives me a lot of funny ideas
00:50:16 Like I I really want to crank it like put a staple my green screen to the wall and just do silly faces
00:50:23 I just I just really want to do that and I have the ability. Yeah, this is sort of like inspiration
00:50:30 comedy like because I've always loved like
00:50:35 You know the goofy the goofy stuff. I sometimes get bogged down when writing scripts
00:50:41 That I have to like make the jokes be smart or have something to do with something and I
00:50:47 I'm watching Tim and Eric. I realize I don't have to I can go back to my roots
00:50:51 I can go back to my YouTube poop days and see and see all of this this
00:50:56 It's it, you know, it's it's based on some sort of observation
00:51:00 So it sort of makes sense, but it is like
00:51:03 It's just really creative and I love it
00:51:05 But I feel I feel so like into making film
00:51:10 Right now. Yeah having having finished, you know, what I what I love about Tim and Eric is that even though I?
00:51:16 Didn't really watch it at all growing up because it was like too much for me
00:51:21 Every show they did
00:51:23 The stuff in it is just so fucking out there that something will just like get into your subconscious at some point like I can remember
00:51:31 Like I only ever saw a few episodes of Tom goes to the mayor and a few episodes of Tim and Eric
00:51:36 But from each of them I have like it like vivid memories of like one line
00:51:41 Like in the first episode of Tom goes to the mayor
00:51:43 I just remember good Tom Brady got his kiosk
00:51:48 Things were finally looking up for him and that's it
00:51:53 I never I never really liked Tom goes to the mayor and so I didn't check it. I didn't really get into
00:52:00 A awesome show when it aired but then at some point someone showed me billion dollar movie
00:52:06 And I really liked it and I was like, hmm. Maybe I maybe I wrote Tim and Tim and Eric style off too soon
00:52:11 I wonder it. Sorry. It's just it's okay. Whoever just linked to this
00:52:17 Davoo linked part of this comment doesn't need to be in the show nose
00:52:20 This is like a like we I think we've talked about this before
00:52:23 But it reminded me of the new storyteller and I'm wondering what a lecture could be done on the new storyteller
00:52:28 If there is enough that would be
00:52:31 The great that would be like the biggest fucking research dump ever though. So, okay, what I linked though
00:52:38 You'd have to watch a lot. Yeah, so
00:52:40 Do we have to talk about more images? I mean, that's just not the whole time you guys were talked about all this giant
00:52:47 Collision I was not do don't look at me scrolling through my deep my Twitter to find this this old gem
00:52:53 I found I'll just read you one pass. Okay. I'm gonna read one of the panels
00:52:58 Here is the panel. I'm gonna read it in the way. It's lined up
00:53:01 Sunset shimmer says any ideas Brock. Why don't we could split up and look for the green genie that way
00:53:09 Thomas as in the tank engine point taking Brock
00:53:13 Sunset shimmer do Susie and autumn ride with swindle Ellie you Amanda Mindy and Sally search the parks
00:53:19 We'll meet back at Pioneer Square Square Ellie says, okay
00:53:23 So it's a bunch of Thomas the tank engine characters some magical girl characters
00:53:28 I don't recognize MS paint modified some transformers Brock from Pokemon Sunset shimmer and the fucking
00:53:35 The fucking parrot from a lab. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The magical girls are all from ojimaja Dora me
00:53:41 Okay, heavily modified their mermaids right now. Oh, there's also Jackie from fucking cyber chase in there
00:53:48 Yeah, I wish I was like I allowed myself to
00:53:52 Express myself this freely, you know, this this thing. I know what you mean. This is this is Chris Chan
00:53:59 I look at this and I think this looks like solitude to me. It's with the same
00:54:02 I feel that same that same like
00:54:04 yearning for like just doing something on this level without worrying about myself image, but I
00:54:12 Yeah, the thing is I think that if any of us tried this, it would actually be amazing. Yeah
00:54:17 I
00:54:19 This is competence. I mean like we all thought that when the only rise tails gets trolled
00:54:24 It sounded like the greatest story ever told. Yeah
00:54:28 the
00:54:30 Yeah, no like hippo if you just fucking took all these fucking magical girls and transformers and Thomas the tank engines
00:54:37 Combine them into a into a gripping narrative. I mean hell
00:54:40 Well, remember that comic that fucking Gibb did with like twilight and you know remember that thing
00:54:46 Oh
00:54:48 Yeah, that was like one of the first deviant art things in my in my my little pony drawing of ponies career
00:54:56 Which lasted like a year or something a really funny interesting fascinating and also ultimately tragic
00:55:02 Case of one of these kinds of creators who's actually good at their medium is elvin earthworm with his creation of Super Mario Bros
00:55:10 It was a Z. Oh, he was back. Is he how are things going? Oh, no, this is the problem. So yeah, wow
00:55:17 Dude who didn't he yeah, yeah, dude who yeah made one of the it was in the height of the sprite animation on Newgrounds phase
00:55:24 And he was the best one
00:55:25 He just took Mario and Luigi super star saga sprites sonic advanced sprites and DBC sound effects and a million people were doing that
00:55:33 But what was unique about elvin earthworm is that he's actually like he got really good at animation
00:55:39 Yep, it had a really it has a great cinematic a style a lot of punch and it's just just as a quick aside
00:55:45 Just a quick aside. I have a rant about like
00:55:48 This and also various other things like Minecraft animations that I've seen in a similar in a similar way
00:55:54 It's my problem with the the thing the reason I never liked it was because it's sprites
00:56:00 But it's animated in flash and the sprites don't
00:56:04 conform to a grid they they move
00:56:08 Diagonally and it looks terrible and I hate it. Oh, yeah, it's cute. It's quaint. I
00:56:14 Agree, I agree. I mean that does bother me, but like
00:56:18 Considering the kind of like this is this is like Newgrounds like early naughty. I mean, yeah
00:56:23 So it's just like as a kid. I see stuff like that and I it was just you know it
00:56:30 Well with Minecraft animations, there's a similar thing where instead of like animating pixel
00:56:37 Movements they have like a jut like a mouth jutting out like in the in the Minecraft model
00:56:43 Like it's supposed to be his fate his head is supposed to be a square, but of course
00:56:47 They don't do that
00:56:48 They they made models so that they could have movable lips and teeth and stuff and it juts out in a way that would not work
00:56:54 I mean, you know does not conform to the size of the pixels in the game
00:56:58 And it just sort of annoys me because it's like you're breaking the rules
00:57:01 It's not mine when I'm watching Minecraft porn
00:57:03 It really pulls me out of the experience when she's got like clearly defined triangle exists and shit like that's really that's not
00:57:11 Come on that doesn't exist that's not a real thing. No, well, they have they have cuboid somebody
00:57:22 Has to be cubes I agree
00:57:25 Hey, Tim and I continue unless DeVue is gonna finish this. Oh, yeah
00:57:30 The tragedy of Alvin earthworm is that because he takes his shit seriously, right?
00:57:36 Which is great because it gives it gives super marabrosi and in sincerity you couldn't you couldn't imitate the problem
00:57:42 Is that he's worried about it's like quality consistent consistency?
00:57:46 So he finally came back after like a three-year hiatus his plan was to remake the show rather than just continue it
00:57:52 And his plan was also to have like a total of 45 episodes each out of 15 like 350
00:58:00 episodes yeah
00:58:01 Considering it was taking him a year to make each one
00:58:03 It's like you're not gonna finish it obviously and like even 10 years ago
00:58:06 I even PMed him saying like I think that's too many episodes
00:58:09 You should stop at 15 because 15 was gonna be end of this one arc and like sure the point is that every episode is more
00:58:14 Bombastic and fast in at 15 that'll be the perfect level
00:58:18 He really should have come back and made episode 9 and just made five more episodes after that that would have been done
00:58:24 He would have been finished, but he wanted to go back and remake episode one
00:58:29 That's a mistake. Yeah
00:58:31 Stuff makes me really sad like he really they have such such like talent, but they overdo it instead of instead of well
00:58:39 It's not even like that
00:58:40 You know the man spend their time making something that isn't like their own original IP
00:58:46 Yeah, like to to not have like I don't know. Yeah, just the fucking
00:58:52 Trapped in f**king giga-paws
00:58:59 Look dude, this is not your magnum opus. Yeah, it's not yeah
00:59:04 Yeah, and then like he did the remake of episode one
00:59:07 I believe three years ago, and he hasn't continued it since so I mean
00:59:10 Yeah, I just think a good really like never you don't redo stuff like don't redo anything
00:59:16 Why would you ever waste your time finish it and then do it better next time?
00:59:22 This is my whole remake things
00:59:23 Why would you ever waste your fucking time remaking something that already exists when you just make something new and the reason is so that you can
00:59:30 Sell things with like that same name, but Alvin ain't making no fucking money on this shit
00:59:34 So just finish your goddamn series and move on
00:59:36 So like you can just make the same like you can just make a different version of the same thing like
00:59:43 some people I
00:59:45 read this review of
00:59:47 Princess Mononoke that was in like an old magazine where this guy was accusing it of just like being the same thing as
00:59:55 Naska but like but with less heart or something
00:59:59 To me that's just like that be a meme of like heart and no heart anyone know this okay nevermind sorry
01:00:05 To me it was like well the thing about Naska is that it is not a functional film
01:00:11 Like the original manga is is amazing and I mean the movies still holds up and is really entertaining
01:00:16 But like as telling the story that the that the manga was trying to tell it falls entirely
01:00:22 Flat of doing that whereas Princess Mononoke was just like let's take all those themes and all the stuff that I care about
01:00:28 Me being Hayao Miyazaki and be like let's make a movie out of that
01:00:34 You know so like something that functions completely and coherently as a film
01:00:38 And then he hasn't had to tackle those themes again because he he did it you know he just
01:00:43 Made it something that made more sense in film form
01:00:46 Yeah, and it's as a film it is way better than the Naska movie
01:00:51 You know and I granted I would you know the Naska manga is also great
01:00:54 I would even say Mononoke just by being tight and
01:00:58 Perfectly crafted is in many ways better than the Naska manga even if it's not as broad sure but like
01:01:04 It's just like yeah
01:01:05 You could just take these concepts and do something better considered instead of literally
01:01:10 Recreating the same thing with better graphics because that doesn't add anything to the meaning
01:01:15 Graphics if you're fucking modern alphadream
01:01:19 It would that yeah, that's true
01:01:22 Significantly worse graphics
01:01:24 You know like the the conundrum of the author or of the of the creator of any medium
01:01:29 Who's just like you know you're making your thing you look back like you're an Andrew Hussie or whoever and you're like man
01:01:35 My early stuff man like I'm writing that I'm doing the same series for so long
01:01:39 Oh, I don't really like that beginning. I gotta fix that. I gotta fix that
01:01:44 What what a terrible ends like we just have to fight against that it's it's a and I know what that feels like too
01:01:49 I know what that feels like to I've always hated that which is why like I have made a point aside from like one or two
01:01:56 Yeah, but very clearly. Yeah, I should get rid of I always try to keep every video. I have live
01:02:04 So the people can see like where I came from and I trust that they have
01:02:09 You know the mental capacity to understand that it's an old video and if they do get upset then I don't have to worry about it
01:02:15 Because there's hopefully with regard. I mean about for me
01:02:17 I feel like maybe I don't get that as much like with my comics
01:02:21 I'm thinking of because like when I finish a comic I feel I look at it and I think oh my god
01:02:28 What a disaster it sucks sure. I hate it
01:02:32 I want to be done with it and never think about it again. So I actually feel very I don't I don't feel the urge to read
01:02:38 I think that it sucks, but I don't feel the urge to redo it. I feel the urge to to throw it away and
01:02:44 Never come and then get it as far away from me as possible
01:02:47 I feel the same way you know
01:02:49 It's like when you take a shit and it's like wow that smells really bad. I want to like be far away from it
01:02:54 Like that's me with art. Yeah
01:02:56 Like any time an artist like looks at their own work at things like wow my technical abilities are so much greater
01:03:03 I could recreate this with better technical ability. It's like dude. How much of what you like
01:03:08 Do you like for its technical?
01:03:10 Like you know quality like yeah much of what all of us like stuff that is like for me
01:03:16 The answer together in an hour almost yeah, just I think most people are probably I think most people are probably the same
01:03:22 Even if they don't know did somebody say John Tron I
01:03:28 I think I think
01:03:30 Probably more I think a lot of people probably
01:03:33 Think that like technical ability matters
01:03:37 More than it actually does them. I think they probably are affected less affected by technical ability of a work
01:03:43 Then they maybe think I don't know if you work if your work is not successful
01:03:48 It's for one of two reasons either at its core
01:03:51 It is not good or you didn't market it enough like I think that if something is good and it fails
01:03:59 It's not because the work wasn't wasn't of a high enough like technical quality
01:04:05 It's because just the right people didn't find out about it and you just got
01:04:13 That's kind of part of what I talked about in this how they market it series
01:04:16 It's something I've fucked up on throughout my whole career is that like I've made stuff
01:04:21 That I just thought like oh nobody's gonna watch it because the lighting is not good
01:04:25 And it's like meanwhile like paranormal activity is like one of the most successful movies of all time the production
01:04:31 It was made on like $2,000 and it looks like shit and most of it is still images of something in the dark
01:04:37 But like it was successful because they put like a well an investor who you know
01:04:42 So like it was it was made on the shoestring budget and sold to an investor who decided to put it in
01:04:48 Test theaters continually of increasing size and when it got good responses from those test theaters
01:04:54 He released it wide and eventually made a thousand sequels because like if you can find something profitable that takes no money to make
01:05:01 You were talking about looking at your old stuff and like being afraid of it trying to destroy it
01:05:05 What one thing I had to go and looked us up to confirm it still true one thing I respect
01:05:11 deeply is that the game theorist's channel still has fully listed and available at the bottom the like
01:05:19 Three or so dozen like clips of young matpat in like high school plays that were
01:05:26 That were uploaded on the channel before game theory started those are still listed
01:05:31 I don't have the courage to have my videos from 2008 listed the digi brony videos are unlisted
01:05:39 70% of everything Jesse's ever created has been deleted, but in matpat
01:05:44 He the king is the spirit of you
01:05:50 Interrupt his searching at all like
01:05:52 The reason I hid all my pony stuff was that like it was like I had like 10 anime videos
01:05:58 And then an endless sea of pony videos and I was like this is not gonna help me market myself as an anime channel
01:06:03 You know
01:06:04 Like yeah, and and also YouTube is really weird about like when you
01:06:09 Relist I don't think this happens necessarily with unlisted videos
01:06:13 But sometimes I've had videos that I originally had unlisted and then I published them and it made them publish as new videos
01:06:19 Oh, I'm afraid of that happening
01:06:21 And that's why you say those were you say those were originally have they been unlisted the whole time and then you made them public
01:06:28 The the the ones I've seen that happen with yes because I actually take the risk to the public service
01:06:34 For everybody April Fool's a public service for everybody
01:06:36 I do you guys watch the creators studio channel on YouTube?
01:06:41 Because it is the thing that we've always wanted of where YouTube directly tells us what they're doing
01:06:46 And I feel like they're oddly unknown among lots of YouTube people, but anyway, they actually just
01:06:52 Yeah, by MKBHD sometimes will mention they just talked about this very issue where yes
01:06:58 If you've had a video unlisted for a long time if you are making it public for the first time
01:07:02 It will treat it as a new video and then it'll you know do all the things yeah
01:07:05 I mean my pony videos were originally listed so assumably. Yeah, those that have that problem. Yeah. Yeah, but
01:07:12 Yeah, yeah, I would kind of want to feud with those guys TBH
01:07:15 I want to feud with them with creative studio
01:07:21 Beef now if you're a PCP fan go leave shitty comments
01:07:25 No, no, no, I don't encourage that at all. No, no, no one's gonna do that. I hope not
01:07:32 I want to start
01:07:33 Yeah, yeah, they're all they're all to do it. Here's my here's my
01:07:37 We tried to start beef with the pizza party podcast like six months ago
01:07:40 I didn't even we didn't we did not try nearly hard
01:07:43 Look, this is a real complaint with the with the with this with this channel the creator studio
01:07:47 I haven't mentioned this up to this point, but here's here's what it is
01:07:50 My complaint is this these people on the channel act as if they have earned the like something like
01:07:57 70,000 subscribers they currently have through like some sort of like skill or like resilience or or where with all of their
01:08:05 Own when these people are the first party
01:08:08 Publishers of YouTube news
01:08:10 They are the sole source of what the hell YouTube is doing it like I am contractually
01:08:16 Obligated as a youtuber to be subscribed to you
01:08:19 So the fact that these people take joy from like yeah, we're doing so well as a channel. No, fuck you. You didn't earn shit
01:08:24 You are you by the way these gems of information by fucking
01:08:29 It is they think if they think like they've accomplished exact somebody should be legally download them and then reupload them
01:08:36 And then that should get a
01:08:40 Call to harass their comment sections and like it's farce on this
01:08:44 I think you at some point are going to experience this paradigm shift when you hit a certain level of popularity
01:08:50 And a certain level of fan base because as it is your fan base is pretty well curated of only people who kind of get it
01:08:56 But if you intend to get like one
01:09:00 Like degree more popular where like what would you call an order of magnitude more successful?
01:09:05 You're gonna have several ghettos full of morons who support you and now you know how I can avoid that
01:09:12 What I have a I have a lot more patience for interacting with people now because
01:09:20 It used to be that all of it frustrated me
01:09:24 But now I realized that like
01:09:27 Almost everyone who like comes at anybody online. There's only two reasons. They would do it either. They're ignorant
01:09:33 They either they either don't actually know what you're doing or they are just like dumb and like they think what you're doing is bad
01:09:40 But if you explained it to them, they'll realize well, hang on Digi
01:09:43 That's assuming that you could never do anything wrong on your own
01:09:46 You didn't point out that you might legitimately be doing something wrong that is
01:09:50 Something wrong. That's fine. You can attack me for it. I would deserve that
01:09:54 But like what I'm saying is that like I used to just see people who were
01:10:01 Misunderstanding me or something or or talking shit and my thing was to just complain about it, but not respond
01:10:08 And now my policy is if someone like shits on me on Twitter
01:10:14 always respond because
01:10:16 Nine times out of ten they just misunderstood something
01:10:19 That's also kind of why Digi bro versus everybody exists because like right right most of the arguments are like someone comes on and like tries to argue
01:10:27 With me and I'm like, oh, well, that's not actually my stance. This is my stance and they go
01:10:30 Oh, well, then we agree and I go. Yeah, you would have known that if you knew my stance
01:10:36 But because you had assumed something else
01:10:38 You didn't know that
01:10:40 So like and they always end amicably like I haven't had a single argument on there that like ended in a shit fit, you know
01:10:47 So I just think it's a better way to resolve things
01:10:50 So when people have their fan base that gets out of control, it's because they don't respond to it
01:10:56 They don't interact with it. Yeah, like, you know, I mean, I just generally agree with that
01:11:02 And that's why I think that the format on your Digi bro versus everybody is is like a smart way because when you get someone in the call
01:11:08 To actually make their arguments about whatever it is
01:11:11 They really have to like present something of substance or else they look like right
01:11:15 But the problem is that happen like people come in and I say like what's your argument?
01:11:20 They're like this and then I'm like, well, why do you think that and then they're like, oh shit
01:11:25 I didn't realize that I don't even know like the last episode. I did someone was like talking about
01:11:31 Oh, your content has changed blah blah blah and I was like, what about my content has changed and the dude had like no real answer
01:11:38 And I was like, well, I mean if anything's changed
01:11:41 I mean, I've changed as a person so it might be that he was like, oh, I didn't think about it that way
01:11:46 I mean, the only thing about this I think is that this can't possibly like compensate for like all viewers
01:11:52 Like I'm not sure how much it could sway like public opinion
01:11:55 Did you like I was saying like like yeah, you're saying oh, I'll have to interact with the community when it's like it's big enough
01:12:00 That's basically what I'm saying the paradigm shift is going to be there's gonna be a moment where there's like more things
01:12:06 You have to watch yourself before you say I remember the last time this happened was when it was your most boring taste in anime
01:12:14 Vlog which wouldn't have been a problem to anyone at all
01:12:18 except for the fact that you name dropped a fucking anime every day and
01:12:23 There was this sudden reaction see what I what I should have done is after he made his video
01:12:28 I should have like
01:12:30 Called him up. I was deeply frustrated
01:12:33 You didn't just like address it directly and you just let the narrative sort of die there
01:12:38 That's the thing like I I used to get so frustrated that people were not understanding my point
01:12:44 And I'd be like that's their fault and now I'm just a lot more patient to just like not stop the argument until they get it
01:12:51 And I think it's just I'm a big believer. I'm a big believer in the idea that like
01:12:56 The I'm a bit I guess I'm a big death of the author guy
01:12:59 And I think that whatever whatever a viewer takes away from a work of art is is the meaning to them and like can the conveyance of meaning is
01:13:07 The author's responsibility and if something other than what was intended is is conveyed to the reader
01:13:13 Yeah, it's not the reader's fault. I don't think it's ever the reader's fault for misunderstanding
01:13:17 I kind of under I kind of agree, but I also feel like
01:13:21 I feel as though it's easy enough for you to just follow up
01:13:26 Like if the reader doesn't get it then just tell them what you meant and a lot of the times they'll go
01:13:32 Oh now I get it. Yeah, I see it happens to me every day
01:13:36 No, I'm arguing with what I've been doing lately is just like dropping these super spicy hot takes on Twitter
01:13:42 And then getting like shitloads of responses and then I just argue with all of them until they
01:13:49 Acquiesce basically like or get it. I I have been away from Twitter not because of that
01:13:54 But every time I come to you know, see what's going on see my notifications
01:13:58 See if anybody said anything and I see you with like a huge big thing and I'm like
01:14:12 Well, yeah, but like I just it just reminds me of things that have happened in in you know
01:14:17 Like the the sort of people that I have had arguments with and then I looked at my last notifications
01:14:22 I I redesigned survivor the Pokemon right thought he looked bad and like every reply was like fuck you
01:14:33 Yeah, and I was
01:14:35 Why would I stay here if if everyone's annoying I've been off Twitter for a couple weeks now
01:14:40 I just fucking I didn't know I I didn't know how terminal that cancer was until I got rid of it
01:14:45 Holy shit every day. I don't log into Twitter. It's like a victory
01:14:50 It's it's it's it's sort of
01:14:53 Dazzling when you when like I've awakened from a from a you know an eternal nightmare
01:14:58 And I just look back at like the the the fire that is like
01:15:04 Wow, I was in that I was there all the time guys about a magical phrase
01:15:08 I've found to so so part of the problem with arguing on Twitter is that like
01:15:13 Some the way I've always handled it is like the people who have a kind of reasonable or like they have an argument
01:15:20 I'll argue with them and those are the people that are easiest because you could eventually reach a point
01:15:25 But then there's the people who just say you're a fucking moron and like I never knew how to deal with those people
01:15:30 But now I figured it out. I just respond explain yourself and like it works because they they either have to now
01:15:38 Explain themselves or not and like so now they have to formulate an argument the only people it doesn't work on to the ones who say
01:15:45 You explain your point first, and I'm like I already did that was the original tweet was an explanation about what are you fucking talking about?
01:15:51 You know like and
01:15:53 Even the people who are really obstinate
01:15:55 They're often obstinate because they're in the heat of the moment
01:15:58 But those people will sometimes come back the next day and be like, yeah, I thought about it and like realize that was stupid
01:16:03 You know my tactic used to be for like for like
01:16:08 You know no argument insults
01:16:10 Tweets or like comments would just be to reply with no
01:16:15 And if they reply it again, I would just reply no
01:16:20 Fingers around my dick when the guy says no
01:16:22 You know, maybe I'm cynical, but I consider responding to most of these things a huge waste of time
01:16:30 No, it's really not because I convert people every day like every time I do this every time I hot take on Twitter
01:16:37 I change a bunch of people's fucking minds about shit, and that's what I want like that's my
01:16:44 Full argument it's that would the time spent okay?
01:16:47 I'm just talking about for my personal life with the time spent doing this
01:16:51 Possibly be better used on just making and I know I can't get like a full video out in the time spent
01:16:55 We'll make working on something that would just like
01:16:58 Isn't it you can reach you can reach 50,000 people kind of sure, but you can reach one person all the way
01:17:06 Yeah, did you explain? I mean, that's good. That's what like community outreach. Did you this is working for you?
01:17:12 There's definitely a place for engaging in like a one-on-one doing doing all this
01:17:17 Did you has worked for you because it's after
01:17:20 Three years of you letting stupid misunderstandings and bad communication fester. Why are you telling did why are you telling digi?
01:17:28 His situation that I've been there for a lot of it. I've been following it very closely for years
01:17:34 It's like I always knew why people were misunderstanding his shit or like not getting his content and
01:17:42 Oh, you always knew to do you had the answers all along is that is that it's not complicated did you's explaining it now?
01:17:49 It's not that hard. It's easy to get people to get it and
01:17:54 It's just a matter of you have to be willing to not give up on a person until they get it because if you
01:18:00 But what the reason that I've taken this stance is that what I realized is these people never go away
01:18:07 Yeah, they never disappear like but the
01:18:11 I mean you'll never convert them all you'll know
01:18:14 But if you can convert enough people that the people who who disagree are in the minority those people will eventually
01:18:21 Look like chumps and they will okay
01:18:24 Other than they won't want to be that way. Yeah, you know
01:18:27 I hear what you're saying, but like on my part of me is just thinking that like I think the best way to handle like
01:18:33 There's no way I can convert the numbers of people. I mean, I don't really have a lot of haters
01:18:38 But you know, that's exactly why it isn't really as relevant to you Nate
01:18:41 You just like make good videos you haven't like gotten that these made opinion shit fit things that it's not universal
01:18:47 I remember I remember in the t-bap days
01:18:49 Yeah, had kind of we had kind of a policy of like don't respond to comments basically. Yeah, that's right
01:18:55 And you know, I think I don't think that was wrong or the wrong way to do it or a bad idea
01:19:01 Like I think the idea was that like responding to comments like kind of puts you down in the muck like with the commoners
01:19:08 So this is a disagree between you and I I very much was of the opinion that like I don't want to engage with the people who are criticizing
01:19:13 The comments because that nothing good will come of it. Yeah was my thinking. I think I
01:19:20 don't know I
01:19:22 I
01:19:23 You know, I don't know. It's calm. I mean, I think okay here. Let me give the most milk toast boring answer
01:19:29 I think I see the validity of both sides of the argument. Okay
01:19:34 We're all winners here. I feel like I'm coming across like a big anti respond to people think it's like if people want to do that
01:19:40 That's fine. I like my my thought is like I could take the time to respond to everybody
01:19:45 But I think that I'm better use of my time is to like work and like lots of people will email me or send me a message
01:19:51 With like I don't know I get a lot of sincere comments on things or like personal messages that people don't want other people to say
01:19:57 I respond like people on my on my on my patron on my discord, you know in Twitter
01:20:02 Like I respond to everything that is clearly sincere that I've ever gotten and if those numbers inflate it
01:20:07 I might not be able to so you know, I miss you in the future take it easy
01:20:11 That's how I want to respond to comments. You have to decide first
01:20:14 We have to decide what is the goal and did you describe his goal pretty clearly? Yeah, basically shift
01:20:20 Where the consensus is to be in my favor, right?
01:20:25 That's been the goal of my all my content basically is like right convince people that
01:20:31 The whatever the consensus idea is if it does not jive with what I think then let me move people over to my side
01:20:39 It's not taking every hill. It's about winning the war net balance, but yeah, but that's that's how I think to and this is my approach
01:20:46 I'm trying to crowdsource the conversion. I'm not trying to do it all myself
01:20:50 I'm trying to get that ourselves here
01:20:52 That's I'm kind of
01:20:53 Kind of that's part of my goal, too
01:20:55 It's just that like and I think with your content you have such a very clear stance that it's easier
01:21:02 To have people who totally get you on your side like I think so for you you you have like
01:21:08 several key points that I think are broadly understood by your whole audience and I have a few of those like
01:21:15 Objectivity doesn't exist like that's something that I don't have to make that argument because literally if someone
01:21:22 Attacks me by saying like your reviews aren't very objective a swarm of my guys will just like jump on that dude
01:21:27 Right, and that's the kind of thing that would probably happen with you if someone was attacking like the core principles of what you do
01:21:33 But yours are just so well-defined and mine are so chaotic
01:21:38 And then also it's very contextual talking about okay does responding to comments put you down in the muck in the
01:21:44 Mire because like there's a pretty clear I think this is I just think it's inefficient. That's all I think there's a pretty
01:21:50 Yeah, unwritten unspoken set of rules and paradigms as to like what is proper conduct, right?
01:21:55 We always have this there's a pretty well your unchallenged consensus that's implicit in a lot of people's ideologies about
01:22:03 Punching up versus punching down
01:22:06 Hence why people suddenly found it controversial that did you would call out other content creators only once his sub count rose
01:22:14 Significantly before that he could call out anyone and no one gave a shit
01:22:18 But once did you was perceived as popular suddenly?
01:22:21 Oh, yeah wrong before that sure not fucking all and and also so it depends on how you respond to individual comments
01:22:29 And what kind of comments you respond to oh so for okay? Okay? No
01:22:33 Sorry, I'm sorry. No, no continue. I have a thing. I really want to say good
01:22:37 But this is my thing. I'm gonna say and then yes
01:22:40 So I had been witnessing a certain a certain like cultural mindset around to me that I wasn't into
01:22:47 This whole idea and I believe it was yeah
01:22:50 I I saw it starting a couple of years ago or a year ago or so this idea that oh
01:22:55 Davoo, you know, he doesn't make his own videos. He edits someone else's videos and this is a problem
01:23:02 He could get held back. He's not doing he's not like trudging out analysis videos like everyone else
01:23:09 He's not writing. This is a problem. He could end up cold and alone any day now
01:23:16 And so step one is to not just dismiss the argument dismiss the idea as just stupid
01:23:22 it comes from a place of logic and I get it and
01:23:25 I saw there was a person who confronted me on it like on a comment section and
01:23:31 Being a huge
01:23:33 Huge condescending prick about it saying shit like oh, this is going to stunt your growth. It's like okay, dude
01:23:40 Fuck off. I get that the internet has made people like he's making a lot of assumptions about your goals in life
01:23:47 Yes, I think people have gotten really used to things the internet the idea of people who make
01:23:52 Things all by themselves, but sure even on the internet. It's actually not that common for things that are actually really popular
01:23:59 Yeah, so but I knew that there's not that many people who are saying this yet, right?
01:24:05 It's not like I'm being inundated with it
01:24:07 And so I can't just make I can't just mount a giant like rebuttal to this
01:24:11 I have to wait for the right time
01:24:12 I mean all that really matters here is like like if he's saying this like all this is an entire argument hinges on
01:24:17 What are your goals if your goals are to become an independent video game analysis channel?
01:24:22 You are fucking up massively, but that's not I mean, I don't think that's a plan
01:24:27 So so on this
01:24:30 This is basically this was basically my tactical decisions. I made right?
01:24:34 Yeah, I was sensing hey some people are murmuring about this
01:24:38 And so I bet there's a lot of people who aren't saying it but they're on the fence about it, right?
01:24:42 People who would love to hear what I have to say my response to it, right?
01:24:46 And so I just have to be tactical there if I immediately jump out like being really defensive about it or really being
01:24:53 Argumentative about it. It'd make people think oh why you've been so defensive about it
01:24:56 There's only like a couple of people who've said this so far
01:24:59 So I just laid and wait and I remember specifically thinking if anyone else comments this to me
01:25:05 I'll I'll fucking I'll do that shit like that's when I'll like that's when I'll strike
01:25:10 So what happened was this one super ultra turbo shit posty troll guy who like is the worst troll of all?
01:25:18 Like commented the perfect model of this ideology, right?
01:25:23 He posted a comment on me, and he was a huge dick about it, and I'm like perfect
01:25:28 I will read this comment in a vlog and then very very
01:25:34 cordially and politely respond to it and
01:25:37 Like provide my case right and I'll look amazing and this whole ideology will look fucking
01:25:45 Retarded because this guy was being hugely like dickish about it, right?
01:25:48 And now I have the video the video is called
01:25:51 Response to everyone who thinks that working with another youtuber is bad something like that and now I just have that vlog in which
01:25:59 I perfectly make my case and I can just link that forever, and that's how I've pitch-shifted the fucking narrative
01:26:08 The subject of like responding personally to things okay, so so
01:26:14 There's this idea, and I think it's pretty obviously true that like you know
01:26:18 You if you've got a fan base if you're if you're popular on the internet or in anything
01:26:23 You know you've got your your body of fans
01:26:26 You know you have people that know you and follow you and maybe like what you're doing
01:26:30 But then there's the subgroup that is like your real fan like the people that will like the people that will actually
01:26:36 Support you in what you do like the people that that care enough to like you know, you know buy your book or or
01:26:42 You know yeah, patreon you or whatever it is
01:26:46 The people that would probably support you no matter what you were doing like that's like a small that's like the bottom
01:26:52 That's like the top ten percent of the top one percent of like the people and like a lot of those
01:26:57 Like those people a lot of them like sometimes you just reach someone on a real deep level with your stuff
01:27:02 But other times that kind of thing comes from like you know you had like you connected with someone on a personal level and you like
01:27:09 You know have like a real human connection due to whether it's just a fucking reply to a Twitter a tweet or I don't know
01:27:17 Maybe the conversation and on discord or anything that could happen. Yeah, and like so
01:27:24 That's
01:27:25 You know like you might grow you might grow your audience you might grow your audience numbers by like putting out like broad
01:27:32 Stuff and like big projects that get seen by a lot of eyes
01:27:35 But like getting that like you know getting like real support
01:27:40 I think to a certain extent it requires or or it's aided and abetted and bolstered by like making a personal connection and doing what I
01:27:47 Guess you might cut through as community outreach or you know just engaging with your fans
01:27:52 You feel that way and I also feel that for everyone. It's a matter of different strata of what you need because I
01:28:00 Ultimately like all of us has a world view and we're hoping to get as many people as much on our side as possible
01:28:08 And so like if you're but there's three different concerns really
01:28:12 There's like how many people can I reach how deeply can I reach those people and also?
01:28:18 Can I live my life while doing this?
01:28:21 You know not just monetarily, but like do the things I want to do in a case like Nate's I think it's healthy for Nate to not be
01:28:29 Like you know answering comments all the time and shit because Nate's got a regular-ass fucking job
01:28:34 He has to do on top of making videos and I think that freed up of that extra seven hours every day
01:28:40 Maybe you would have more time to talk to individuals and stuff because probably I
01:28:45 Don't know. I think you would probably get bored if all you were doing all day was nothing but working on videos
01:28:52 So but like in your situation
01:28:54 It's like there are other things and for me for a long time. It was a combination of I
01:29:00 first of all
01:29:02 If you're not feeling as though your basic need of like being
01:29:07 Understood by people and like fitting into society and like having a concrete purpose is met
01:29:12 It's a lot harder to then go and like
01:29:17 Communicate with others and and for me
01:29:18 I always felt like the outsider even when I was getting big because of the fact that like the anime YouTube
01:29:24 community never really accepted me and the fact that like
01:29:28 You know, even though I had all these subs
01:29:30 I was always like a weird odd man out like I was always the the last guy
01:29:34 Invited or informed kind of thing but like in the time once I you know got a relationship
01:29:40 And I feel like may
01:29:42 Understands me completely. There's nothing. There's no disconnect. You know, even with like some of my closest fans
01:29:48 There's always a disconnect because they know me as the guy who I am portraying myself as on the internet
01:29:54 And even with you guys, there's some level of like macho posturing that has to go on with a bunch of dudes in a group
01:30:00 You know, you know, but like if I have somebody
01:30:06 By having somebody who gets me all the way it's like that need for acceptance
01:30:10 I've I've got that and I don't need to fight for that now
01:30:14 So it's not it's not about like oh, I have to make ever make sure everybody understand on the internet gets me and accepts me
01:30:21 Now it's more like all right. Well, that's fine. I've been accepted now. I'm worried about it for their sake
01:30:27 It's no longer about like I want everyone to understand me because that will make me feel good
01:30:32 Now it's like I want everybody to understand me so that they get my message clearly and because my message is ultimately trying to help people to
01:30:41 You know to do the things that that have worked for me, you know, like it's it's I guess it's just less ego driven
01:30:48 It's less of like I've been right all along and you all should listen to me now
01:30:52 It's more of like hey guys if you listen to me, this would actually help you with your life and you'd be less depressed
01:30:57 Yeah, you know, so like let me help you with that
01:31:00 That's how I feel to about my content but on the subject of people understanding you I take it a couple steps further
01:31:06 Then then what you're saying because I believe that literally no one will ever fully understand me
01:31:12 Who is outside me and also I myself will never fully understand me either
01:31:17 And I can't predict what my response is going to be and so I've just accepted the the darkness of my existence
01:31:23 And I've made some degree of peace with it and it feels pretty okay as long as you're at peace with it
01:31:28 That's all that really matters. I agree. It reminds me of my brother Victor when
01:31:33 You know, he had long-standing depression and thoughts of suicide
01:31:36 But he he tried therapy he tried medication and none of it worked
01:31:39 And he just kind of came to terms with the idea that he just was depressed and that's who he is and once he accepted
01:31:47 It was no longer scary, I guess and I mean eventually he got into a loving relationship and now he's like happy
01:31:54 He's no longer like considering suicide, but like it was just like once he was
01:32:00 What if that crumbles for whatever reason, you know, you need a foundation. Yeah, well, I mean he found the foundation
01:32:07 Yeah, so far as realizing that like
01:32:10 This was just not something to be like the only thing that makes it scary
01:32:16 You know sure I think that I think the takeaway here is that he made he made peace with it like before he finding this
01:32:22 Yeah, yeah, okay. That's less. Yeah, like it was that he decided that he needed the relationship to save him from the depression
01:32:31 Yeah, it's that he realized that like this is not something curable
01:32:35 So if I'm gonna have to live with it anyways, then let's not get hung up on it
01:32:39 Like let's not spend all our time wallowing in the fact that I'm depressed and suicidal
01:32:43 Like I have to just live my life and just like let that be a part of my life
01:32:48 Yeah, I was able over the course of like five seven years just turn all of my mental disorders into my job
01:32:55 Very conveniently how that worked out. I don't I mean I've never been diagnosed with with clinical depression or anything
01:33:02 but I mean I thought
01:33:04 Yeah
01:33:05 I've had the same like you know leave the world really sucks and and even even if you're healthy and even if you don't have
01:33:13 Mental illnesses per se like you know the world's a dark place and things are gonna suck some time and you just you know
01:33:19 You got it. You gotta no matter who you are. You got to make peace with that and once you do it's not as bad
01:33:24 That's the one way to make it better is you got you got to make peace with that it sucks
01:33:30 That's something I kind of I touched on this a little bit in my land of the luster's video that like I think
01:33:36 One of the biggest problems with with people is that we all try to run away from trauma or like view it as something to be
01:33:43 Healed and it's like trauma is going to happen to you because like if you love anyone
01:33:49 You're gonna watch someone you love die. That's gonna happen to you and like so you unless you're lucky enough to die soon
01:33:55 That's yeah, I almost said that in the video, but I cut that line out cuz I thought I would scare too many people
01:34:02 But like yeah if if you if you know if you live you will experience trauma and like there is nothing that makes
01:34:11 The past not happen. There's nothing or even if something happens now
01:34:16 You have some yes
01:34:18 But the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it. Hey cause a I like Lion King
01:34:25 I like Lion King. It's fine. Don't don't hate me
01:34:29 Yeah, that's Rafiki ah good old nigga Rafiki
01:34:32 Damn it. That was my best Rafiki impression
01:34:36 Is that the first nigga word that has been said
01:34:41 No, since we since we we implemented the nigga jar
01:34:49 That's two from hippo
01:34:54 If I referenced the job, but then you could get away with like hey just look at that nigga jar over there
01:35:00 He's gonna steal my wallet. I better walk on the other side of the street. You know, that's that's no good
01:35:03 That's no good. I can read between
01:35:08 Yeah, exactly none of you are pure I had I had a thing as to say about the comments
01:35:15 Comments that make me confront harsh truths about myself and make me sad and it sucks such as
01:35:25 That wasn't very funny. That's the comment that really gets me
01:35:29 When I know something wasn't good and I put it up anyway, and I was like no
01:35:34 They found out. They know they see it. It's when you kind of believe it
01:35:39 Yeah, it's when someone points out something that you believe to one degree or another
01:35:45 Believe it and like my reaction is always to try to explain it away
01:35:48 And at that point it becomes kind of a battle of wills of like that's true
01:35:52 Because a lot of the times I'll like someone will criticize me for something and then I'll like
01:35:57 Justify it and they'll go. Oh, well, I guess it's fine
01:36:00 But then like because I am smart enough to then run the rest of the scenario of like how the argument would have gone if they had
01:36:06 Been strong enough to fight me then I'll then get depressed
01:36:09 Realizing that they were right. They were just
01:36:14 What I have like
01:36:16 You know gone beyond that whole like
01:36:20 Reactionary like well, no, no, it's not it's not true
01:36:24 Like when I see a comment that is like tells me the truth and I'm like, yeah, man
01:36:29 I want to like I don't want to respond because I just don't care to involve myself with
01:36:35 Things like that but the way they phrase them like it's just a normal thing like these comments
01:36:42 Whether then like putting me down easy or not
01:36:45 There's this sense of like
01:36:47 They expect me to if I read it to respond in a defensive manner and to have an argument against them
01:36:54 And they're sort of preparing for that in the original sort of statement
01:36:58 And if I don't respond it like in reality, I'm humble and I'm like, yeah
01:37:04 I agree, but I don't care to say that but I feel like I have to say that
01:37:07 So that I can appear humble because that's the truth and they they they they like if it's just left
01:37:14 Responded to that makes me look publicly like I
01:37:19 disagree
01:37:22 Let me give an example
01:37:23 Let me give you I just had a great example of this the other day confirms everything you're saying and it was um
01:37:27 This is on the on the pod D cast there was a commenter who just respond like I there's been a little controversy lately about a little bit
01:37:33 Of convenience happening in one piece. We won't get into it, but someone just said simply something along the lines of
01:37:39 Nate like you're fucking wrong. You noodled armed fat faggot and I thought
01:37:47 You know, I just thought to myself, yeah, I guess I could hit the gym a little more
01:38:00 Better if I just admit to it and cop to it like if it's something I agree with and I
01:38:05 Because for me it it helps to put like it's like if I don't respond
01:38:10 It's because I'm afraid of having to change to confront it
01:38:15 But that's absolutely what it is. You know what? I want them to be respond though
01:38:19 Sometimes if I like actually say like you're right, I will then go change it because like
01:38:26 100% 100% of the internet is people being afraid to say man that makes me sad. You're right
01:38:33 Yeah, that's true. That's true. What happened. Okay, so recently I ended up
01:38:37 We're turning the comments on my roller coaster Tekken one versus three video back on again thinking, you know a year after that
01:38:45 Stupid undertale video I made happened
01:38:48 I like close the comments on that and then un reopen the comments a year later and fucking no one commented
01:38:54 So clearly that's a safe bet reopens comments and RCT video the comments just continue as they always had
01:39:02 Today what I fucking cursed myself with the algorithmic eternity
01:39:07 I don't are they as shit as ever are they yeah, they're they're just as bad as ever
01:39:12 They're it's literally like 2015 and we'll never stop fucking happening. I god damn
01:39:19 Interesting I still get I mean this makes sense because it's not out
01:39:22 But my I'm happy to say that my final five seven. Why does it why does it bother you so much that you keep getting comments?
01:39:28 Maybe they're just never stop
01:39:33 Why does it bother you that they don't so much that's bothering so much that it baffles me that they're still
01:39:39 Consistently coming out at the same speed. It's really funny to me
01:39:42 But here's what I've done decided to do differently with my approach because I mm-hmm like like looking at the video now
01:39:49 With a lot more experience. I mean, I haven't even rewatched it. I'm just like remembering it now with better critical thought
01:39:56 It's pretty obvious why people walk away with that video with the exact misunderstandings that they do
01:40:03 So I took one comment that says by mr. Star it's a comment that says
01:40:07 I have never seen a video more deserving of dislikes than this one
01:40:12 I took that comment pinned to that comment and then replied to it with about three or four paragraphs of me
01:40:19 criticizing the video on
01:40:21 My terms and that is how I think I'm fine
01:40:26 I just I just feel like you've already lost by taking the effort to do that like this is already a lost battle
01:40:32 I mean, it's
01:40:35 Because you're fighting the tide you are fighting the tide my friend and there's no
01:40:40 Winning when you're fighting
01:40:41 It's it's not necessarily like a waste of time if you're not changing someone's mind because you might be changing
01:40:47 His mind somebody's gonna be right behind him by being okay
01:40:57 Billion you can't change billion. I mean, I obviously
01:41:00 There's only 300 million in America. Okay. All right. I can work through 300 million. I
01:41:07 Well, I mean frankly, I don't want to so I guess that's where I'm approaching
01:41:10 Hey, I think I want to I have done a thing. We hang on. Well. What was gives it?
01:41:14 I am I have done a thing where I have gone through like all of my hypocrite videos because uh, you know, I have like troubles
01:41:23 knowing where to take
01:41:24 New videos and I just like I just have troubles. I just have troubles. I well, I you know, then don't we all
01:41:33 But uh, I've I went through them and I made a little
01:41:36 Spreadsheet and I put the name of the episode or the video and I did a little like
01:41:42 Review of it. Like what I thought when I was rewatching it
01:41:46 What problems I found and what things I actually really liked and then I gave it a little like
01:41:51 like
01:41:52 Word school like good bad great a little iffy like stuff like that and
01:41:58 Then I put that on my on my discord for people to look at and I feel like that's basically the same as like criticizing
01:42:05 Like what DeVoo did with criticizing. It's not about like changing other people's minds. It's just like a helpful introspective
01:42:11 Way to like think about what you have done and how you can grow from it here using that using people's like
01:42:19 This taste as like a catalyst. There's a difference between what I think you think I want
01:42:25 Emotionally psychologically and what I actually do want which is okay not an admittance of wrongs from anyone
01:42:32 I mean that'd be nice
01:42:33 Sometimes when someone gets real heated and like keeps responding like five times over the course of two days
01:42:38 I'm thinking it's time for you fucking admittance
01:42:41 But even then if two days go by they don't say anything
01:42:44 That's what I want the feeling that I made a good case that satisfies me
01:42:49 Automatically regardless of how they actually respond, right? Okay, so like around like when the video was new my my approach was just
01:42:57 Asked them to elaborate like what the fuck do you mean by bias? What do you mean by nitpicking?
01:43:01 You know, which was satisfying enough, but now I just say I have a copy pasted
01:43:05 Please go look at the verse
01:43:07 I have a pinned comment a reply to a pinned comment where I analyze what I think is wrong with this video
01:43:12 Go check that out if you're curious what was wrong with this video
01:43:15 Uh, I even got one person explicitly saying no, uh, it wasn't because of the writing structure
01:43:20 It was because you're biased
01:43:22 It's because you're biased and so then I just went back to the old technique explain what bias is hasn't responded and
01:43:28 That to me is satisfying because I that's the thing about what people don't get about angry mobs on the internet
01:43:35 They're often right, but in the wrong way
01:43:38 Yeah, they're or they're wrong for the right reasons. They don't know
01:43:42 Econ is always saying yeah when I talked to him about this stuff is that like
01:43:47 That you know, even the dumbest shittiest commenter like they have a point. They're just bad
01:43:53 They're just like they don't understand language well enough to explain it
01:43:57 So if you are good at language, then you can kind of work on sussing out what they actually think, right?
01:44:04 But unfortunately with people like that at the same time
01:44:07 They're too easily swayed like if they're bad at language and you're charismatic and good at language
01:44:13 It's easy enough for you to kind of trick them into not
01:44:17 Unders like you know into like just agreeing with you without actually addressing
01:44:22 What was their original point?
01:44:24 Not that that's necessarily bad because it just means that now they have moved past this whatever they were ignorant about it
01:44:30 Just doesn't like you didn't have to like
01:44:33 Let me respond to that too because here's my here's my hardcore anime analysis response to that
01:44:38 The reason why I think my approach is better is because what I'm doing is I am showing and not telling the audience that I am correct by
01:44:46 Not responding directly with the long word exercise
01:44:49 But just by living a great life and achieving things and working hard
01:44:53 I'm showing them that I'm right in just in a general sense of in life as opposed to in the whatever particular argument
01:45:00 Is that going on? I think that like mounting a a strategic rebuttal to anything is only something you should do like
01:45:06 Empirically, it's not something that everyone should do clearly your whole like your whole brand works on it like works itself
01:45:13 It doesn't need to be self-justified. It like it just works, right?
01:45:16 Meanwhile, there's definitely a too much. There's definitely you can definitely
01:45:21 Respond to absolutely
01:45:23 I would say someone who really should have done something to respond was the irate gamer who
01:45:29 In 2012 made this like whole like big
01:45:33 Confessional vlog about how like oh the AVG was actually ripping him off not vice versa or something
01:45:38 And I remember reading like blog posts like like rebutting irate gamer saying that like no he's still wrong
01:45:44 I read gamers like full of shit. I don't know if irate gamer was full of shit
01:45:48 But it was basically him talking about his perspective of this huge fucking YouTube career
01:45:54 He had of being this in like infamous pariah
01:45:57 That like people didn't under like like like that that was just en masse
01:46:01 Disregarded and shamed for being a blatant APG and ripoff with lots of those okay, whatever never mind go on
01:46:06 There were there were a lot of people trying to be AVG in from the beginning
01:46:09 It's just that irate gamer was a really shitty one
01:46:11 sure he would like steal individual jokes and what really incited the the criticism was that this was back when YouTube had to
01:46:19 specifically authorially ordain
01:46:22 Monetization upon people and would also personally get involved in who gets promoted
01:46:26 AVG in was totally snubbed despite being one of the top 20 channels and irate gamer was like black like
01:46:32 Air blasted up his ass for no particular reason why no one knows your situation
01:46:38 All right good the algorithms or at least you know or at least chaotic evil rather than
01:46:44 Orderly evil so
01:46:48 The problem with irate gamer trying to tell his story is that he told it in 2012 when his YouTube career began in
01:46:55 2006 your six fucking years too late if there's a real problem out there
01:47:02 There's a real misunderstanding and their misunderstanding has some intellectual merit
01:47:06 Even if it's being made by morons and troll faggots. Mm-hmm. Do we need a faggots jar?
01:47:11 You you are not above that stupidity
01:47:14 I think there is an extent to which people are overly egotistical to think that they are so above it all that a valid
01:47:22 Or at least seemingly valid criticism is beneath them
01:47:27 I'm on the record is very much pro comments, and I retain that now
01:47:31 I'm all for reading comments in a way that just doesn't waste your time
01:47:34 That's what you need to remember is also there is you might think oh
01:47:37 Like you're never gonna change the opinions of the of the angry mob battering down your doors not by responding to individual comments
01:47:43 Yes, that's my position even if that's the case what we don't ever give credit to is the 90% population
01:47:49 They actually legitimately silent majority don't write comments who don't need to be responding to and read the comments well
01:47:55 But they yeah, yeah, yeah, they they want to they want to support you they want to be on I mean we're right
01:48:01 You're not just respond. I mean if it's in a public place like Twitter
01:48:04 You're not just responding to this one person when these okay to to a sentiment that is shared by a silent group
01:48:10 And this one person is just
01:48:19 This idea
01:48:25 People who are most inclined to share their opinion are outliers the people who are most inclined to speak out are people
01:48:32 Who think that their stance is not normal or that it's not held by the majority
01:48:37 But but how often are they gonna be the only one not only will they be the only one but to look at those people as
01:48:44 Like a huge group. It's like more likely. They are the smallest group, and that's why they feel so in-sense to say
01:48:54 That you will sway the majority by responding, but you will doubt you're definitely influencing more than just
01:49:02 I'm talking about the majority that does like you
01:49:04 I'm talking about the people who are like are your subscribers
01:49:06 But not the people whose names you know right and these are people who want to be on your side who by default are on your side
01:49:13 but
01:49:14 They might be concerned by the criticisms and they might want you to respond for their sake
01:49:22 You know what you know, that's true. I mean I want to hear you out
01:49:25 They do want to agree with you, but they can't agree with you if you do not make a case for them to agree
01:49:32 I'm all for I am all for addressing concerns of
01:49:36 Like any serious issues that are brought up if it's like you got a fact wrong is like sorry, whatever
01:49:41 I mean, you know that there's a like if someone's like your content's going to shit
01:49:44 These are my arguments why and also I hate you then like there is things of value in there to be to be addressed in some way
01:49:51 Now is the right way to directly respond with comment? I could see that is the right way to I don't know write a blog post
01:49:56 maybe or
01:49:58 Possibly is the right way to just take that advisement on board and try to adjust your content to address that
01:50:04 I don't know that I know you were just like like grab bagging for like an extreme example
01:50:09 Yeah, I would say that's an example that is so extreme that it doesn't really need to be said because it's just like if someone thinks this content is all shit
01:50:15 Oh, well
01:50:16 It can be far more specific. It can be a way better example
01:50:19 Yeah, I think you need to have like stratification of your level of responses where like right again because of the fact that we're
01:50:26 measuring these these different factors like
01:50:29 Like your your own time, you know like if if you that's a big one for me if I read a comment that is in any way
01:50:38 Reasonable then I'm fairly confident I can reach this person without too much effort if I read a comment
01:50:45 That's totally unreasonable. I might it depends on how dumb the person
01:50:50 Seems because if they seem really dumb but like in a kind of innocent way
01:50:55 Then I'll be like I bet I can convert this person because they're just dumb and they'll just listen to me because I sound smart if it's somebody who's like
01:51:03 Malicious and like act like the only people who I block on Twitter are the ones who just come at me like fuck you
01:51:10 You're a pedophile and I'm like I I could argue with these people about like Lolly or whatever
01:51:17 But like they're they obviously don't care they obviously do not care about arguing
01:51:23 They are just determined towards hatred and like those are the only people where I look at them
01:51:28 And I'm like this will not like there's no way I'm gonna be able to do this via social media
01:51:33 Maybe if I met this person face-to-face and talk to them. There's a chance
01:51:38 but like
01:51:39 Like if this person is just someone who views the internet as a place to spew bile at people with no consequence
01:51:47 Then it's better to just excise them because eventually
01:51:52 Everyone will excise them like people who are like that people who are just like who are just toxic like
01:51:58 The thing is everyone's on the commute on the internet for a sense of community people come to the internet because they feel that they are
01:52:04 They don't fit in enough with the people around them immediately in their personal life
01:52:09 So they need to find a group they need to find a tribe and they come on the internet to do that
01:52:13 But the thing is most people your tribe is either
01:52:19 It probably has to directly interact with other tribes on the internet and that's where all this conflict comes from
01:52:24 But I'm glad for that. I'm glad that all these people are being challenged and constantly being asked to to reassess their opinions
01:52:30 But if you approach it like sociopathically if you're somebody who comes in and you are not interested in conversation
01:52:38 You're not interested in like, you know
01:52:41 In in forming an argument if you're just trying to spew bile eventually you will piss off
01:52:48 Everyone like one by one people who are on your side will eventually be like fuck man
01:52:53 Like you really like you're really gonna go that you really gonna go there
01:52:58 You know and eventually you'll get you'll slowly be cut from everybody. I agree
01:53:02 And so yeah, so I think it I think there is a power in just like blocking people and just being like fucks you
01:53:08 Go go in the corner and think about what you've done and eventually at like when enough people block that person
01:53:14 They have to finally at some point ask. Hey, am I a piece of shit?
01:53:17 I'm a piece of shit, you know, you know, you don't there's no responsibility
01:53:22 There's no responsibility to engage with everyone and some people are definitely not worth engaging with you
01:53:28 There's no shame in deciding this person's not worth my time. There's nothing. I don't think there's anything like
01:53:34 Yeah, I don't think you should feel bad about blocking it
01:53:37 It's interesting like if if you don't want to engage with someone you don't have the kind of thing you're talking about
01:53:42 It was slightly different what I was gonna say, which is like just non malicious people
01:53:47 But just people whose opinion of you is that your shit, right?
01:53:50 And no matter what like lead in or rationales I have for why your shit whoever you are
01:53:56 The thing is if they just think outright your videos are bad and you think your videos aren't bad
01:54:03 Then it may not necessarily be worth talking to them or trying to change their mind because like there's a clearly
01:54:09 Fundamental difference in opinion here, right?
01:54:12 So I mean it kind of depends on if there's somebody who wants to like your stuff or not because like yeah
01:54:20 Suggests that like like most people who just don't like something aren't gonna go out of their way to say so
01:54:25 So like if they're going out of their way to make their stance apparent either they're a huge douchebag or
01:54:32 There's more to it than that like that dude mr.
01:54:35 Cynical who came on did you brothers is everybody and like both times his argument was basically like you're not doing the type of content
01:54:43 I want you to do right dude's been watching me for like five fucking years. So that's clearly not entirely true
01:54:49 It's just that like is that are you I mean couldn't he have just liked your early stuff and just obviously he's still
01:54:55 No, he like he comments on like every video I make
01:54:59 Possible that he there is a sense of dissatisfaction despite still being heavily there's definitely a sense of dissatisfaction
01:55:05 it's just that like
01:55:07 the to to boil it down to like we just are looking for something different out of videos like I
01:55:13 Don't know if it's that simple so much as it's that we are both
01:55:18 Understanding what the videos are or like what the goal of them is differently and that could potentially be reconciled like yeah
01:55:25 I haven't I have not given up on this guy changing his stance or me changing my stance and like for what it's worth like
01:55:33 his
01:55:34 His idea that like my videos were too personal like my response was like well in my opinion all
01:55:41 Criticism is inherently extremely personal like because you can't you're not writing it from someone else's perspective
01:55:47 You're writing it from your perspective, and that's always going to be affecting it
01:55:51 So like whatever is unique about you is the thing that you should fixate on but at the same time I
01:55:57 Have found ways that I can write about shows that are extremely personal, but aren't like flag-waving about it
01:56:05 Yeah, you know and like I think that's really what he means is like not so much that he wants me to divorce myself from
01:56:13 the analysis but that like
01:56:16 To remove the ego from the analysis
01:56:20 You know something like like my gurren login review is just like like that is a late in
01:56:25 100% like with my personality the why like I've interpreted things this way
01:56:29 But then like I get away with that and nobody accuses me of ego because I just slip in the like me relevant thing at the very end
01:56:35 Like that's just one little it's just a little and yeah
01:56:38 I mean and that you know I can get away with that but like on the subject of of like how we
01:56:44 Like personal like what I wanted to say about that was I think we have a fun a slightly different just world view as to like how to
01:56:51 Change people or if people can change I think I do think that I will be less successful
01:56:57 I have a little bit less faith in the earnestness of commenters and like their willingness to change and also
01:57:02 I think it is harder for people to change with with some of this stuff, but like I just view it that I
01:57:07 I'm not necessarily concerned with their willingness to change. I will force them to change
01:57:10 Okay, okay, but I think that is a world around people they have to change to fit into that world
01:57:16 That's true, but like I mean and I so we're kind of on the same pager
01:57:19 But like I see it that just like I will just I will just front load myself with like the kind of like
01:57:25 Positive vibe that I want them to have with me initially and maybe that makes me more like milk toast or less provocative or whatever
01:57:31 but like
01:57:33 You know that like like Ben was saying before like I don't want people to walk away from my content
01:57:37 And I don't really think about this a lot
01:57:39 It kind of just just happens
01:57:40 But I don't want them to walk away with even really much of a chance of like a bad impression
01:57:45 That I then have to correct later. So like, you know to at least some degree
01:57:49 I think about like how what I say will be interpreted and so like like I think like my first impression is the is the best chance
01:57:56 To like hit these people and make them, you know, not think that I'm totally retarded. So, you know, I guess that's just where my
01:58:03 Though that's why I say before I do think that your content is just a lot clearer than mine about like what your intentions are
01:58:10 Who you are what you want the audience to take away like that's all very
01:58:15 Evident and with me there's always been an unsureness even within myself about what my content is why it exists or what I want
01:58:22 People to take away from it. So like that's why I haven't been able to like communicate as clearly as you have
01:58:29 But I hope to fix that. You know, sure. I mean, I'm not trying to suck my own dick or anything
01:58:33 I'm just you know, just just pointing out. I think that the the difference of worldview that I think you agree with
01:58:38 At least to a degree
01:58:40 Well, we're two hours into this should we get into I think it's time. I think it's time to switch gears a little bit
01:58:45 Yeah, I'm ready. Let's uh, okay guys. We got a couple more PCP themes on deck for our listening pleasure
01:58:54 Next week will be the last time we actually let me bring stuff
01:58:58 So so I'm looking at the dates. We said that the 31st is like the last day that people can submit
01:59:03 We've got today's recording the 29th recording and then there's two days
01:59:06 I think technically speaking what we should do is say that the fifth is the last day
01:59:10 We listen to anything but it's only going to be submissions that were in on the 31st or earlier sound good sound fair reasonable
01:59:17 Yeah, okay, so there'll be two more segments after this one though. They'll probably be shorter and shorter, okay?
01:59:22 So here we go first one. So if you're listening to this, this is probably your last chance
01:59:26 Yeah, yeah, you've got like two days if you're listening to this to get it in or something
01:59:32 Let me double. Yeah. No, you got one two three
01:59:34 You've got four days you got four days to get it in if you're listening to this
01:59:41 Buddy, I'm sorry. So anyway, yeah, here's our first PCP theme of the day
01:59:47 This is from oblivion fall who comments. Uh, this is the first out of two PCB themes
01:59:52 I'm submitting to the procrastinators his second more serious entry, which is going to be called PCP dream theme
01:59:59 It's currently in production and will feature real musicians ETA one week
02:00:04 He's I have I have real musicians unlike all these fucking acts that have been submitting
02:00:10 Means live musicians probably in fall makes me think of what your name is trying to be you should just take it all the way and just call it
02:00:18 More oblivious fall room
02:00:20 Probably he has a dragon after also is at his at Oblivion. I mean he probably only likes those two games that he's referenced
02:00:28 Like two and four that's like the most weirdly specific elder scrolls opinion I've ever heard. All right, but let's get to it. This song is
02:00:37 It is called this is the PCP meme theme is the meme theme meme theme
02:00:43 Call aka horse tranquilizer
02:00:46 Here we go one two three
02:00:50 Bam
02:00:57 Oh god, that is sharp
02:01:04 Yes, I think this is
02:01:20 Make Starfleet
02:01:37 I think of my first time
02:01:50 Oh
02:02:13 I thought that was actually fucking awesome. There's more. There's more. Oh
02:02:20 I think I was just you crying at the end Ben weird that creep me out a little bit aside
02:02:24 Oh, I felt like if you took out the quotes and the random sharp spikes of it was a meme theme
02:02:31 It was a meme theme by the way. Yeah, but it was like it was
02:02:35 Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's awesome. It was like a it was like a
02:02:39 Demon version of like dragon
02:02:43 So that should be no, yeah, I think that just needs to be a video
02:02:48 Someone just needs to make a video
02:02:51 Video is this video right now. I guess we animated somebody animate the whole thing
02:02:58 I'm a little disappointed with my quotes
02:03:00 I guess I gotta work on I like I don't remember the the line where you said I'm pretty sure I didn't come my first time with that
02:03:11 Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it's from the virginity because that's a strange line to pick
02:03:15 Funny I appreciate the going back through the episodes. Yeah, he clearly worked hard on this one
02:03:20 That's to be saluted for sure
02:03:22 Now remember this guys. This is one of two and this was his meme of version
02:03:27 What is his real submission going to be like dude?
02:03:32 Maybe maybe if there's any topping this I don't know if there's any topping I mean
02:03:36 I really like I don't even like hate that as like a real pick possibly that was really good
02:03:43 Really want the first like 10 seconds. Yeah, for sure
02:03:46 But like imagine if someone animated like a procrastiners opening like with this
02:03:51 I think it's a little too intense. Oh sure. It's the opening because like if someone clicks on this podcast
02:03:56 Who's never heard of it. It's just gonna open with
02:03:59 Yeah, blast beats, you know, that's fair. That's fair. I mean man. That was a great fucking we should use that for something
02:04:05 We should we got to use all these for something we should literally put together an album at the end of like we should creme
02:04:10 Yeah, oh dude, we should put together an album and then we can get the guy who did the gorillas animation
02:04:18 We will sell the album and reap all the profits and pay nothing to the well
02:04:23 They did
02:04:25 Pay them an exposure. Yeah, that's what we do. That's what we do you Vee explain
02:04:29 Well, that was fucking great our oblivion fall. You're killing it, dude. I'm super excited to see the next one get that in
02:04:36 Just to be clear. I love that. That was also. I'm eating beef
02:04:39 I'm eating slow slim chips. Well, there you are ladies and gentlemen. Next up is oh, what's what's his Twitter thing?
02:04:45 This is from
02:04:47 How damn it Ken at fit what the fuck at Ken Crayley Ken Crayley this is Crayley. This dude's an actual musician
02:04:55 Oh shit really. I'm like all these other have been submitting
02:04:59 Sent me an album. He made one. So wait a minute. Okay. All right. Let me read this thing here
02:05:03 He says here's a short rock instrumental called explosion
02:05:07 5,000 that my band Casino's made a while back that we never end up expanding into a full song
02:05:12 I thought it might be theme worthy
02:05:14 Maybe you'll dig it. Well, I mean, let's just let's find out. This is a
02:05:19 Explosion 5,000 by the casinos here we go
02:05:22 Oh
02:05:32 It sounds like an 80s anime theme. Yeah
02:05:43 I'm just waiting to hear a Japanese man singing about Gundams pretty much
02:05:48 Oh
02:05:49 That was really good sounding. I mean I like I like that. It's you know, it's short and punch. Yeah, it's very triumphant
02:05:56 I feel like it's uh, it's it's almost too hopeful for this this
02:06:01 Yeah, I'm with I suppose that I am approaching the the theme concept from the same way
02:06:07 I did with the me and math of the theme which is use a short segment for like opening of the things
02:06:12 But I do want there to be like a big epic version that can be played during our anime final battle
02:06:17 You know, that's that's how I'm thinking about
02:06:22 More to that song that maybe he just said no
02:06:25 He said that this is just like they made just this little instrumental that they never expanded into a full song
02:06:30 So I guess that's this is what there is. I mean anyway, it was well was really good. Yeah, I mean
02:06:36 It's not as it I mean, I can't
02:06:40 Actually made for the show
02:06:42 It doesn't feel like it was written for the PCP because it was which is indeed indeed
02:06:47 All right next one. It's a good it like if I ever made a show that I felt I needed an intro with that tone for it
02:06:54 It would be fine for that. Yeah, like if I was doing like a Conan barbarian review show like I'd use something like that
02:07:01 All right, send that to Razor fist let that be his new oh, yeah, he'd be down for that
02:07:05 That's kind of like it. All right. Here's at zero alias 394 submits
02:07:12 It's called love stuff and each other PCP theme attempt number one. Okay. Here we go
02:07:20 Go
02:07:31 Shit
02:07:35 Yeah, all right
02:07:42 I like this it's got a it's got a yeah, it does really like melody
02:07:51 Oh
02:07:53 Oh
02:07:58 You know what would make this great, but also just an oniguchi song what if they did the oniguchi like Blast beat drums in there
02:08:07 I I love I really like that one. Yeah
02:08:10 Yeah, I really like the beginning when it just sounded like a fucking acid trip. That was I it was yeah
02:08:16 I like the beginning. It was interesting, but then when the the actual like tune came in. Yeah, it was great
02:08:22 I was way into that melody. Yeah, and I think it's not a bad fit tonally that that would be like
02:08:28 I'm imagining like quotes being laid over the top of that or like somebody speaking over the top of that
02:08:33 That would be like a good. I don't like the idea of using quotes from the show so much
02:08:37 But like well someone speaking over it to like explain the basic, you know
02:08:43 I want someone I want to not one of us person being like I don't know in the midst of time
02:08:49 There was a podcast where a bunch of gay homo boys got together
02:08:55 Sleepy cast and so I I would like to point out that there is I have seen some sentiment
02:09:01 I have seen some sentiment floating around that my musical intro to Steven Steven universe episode 2 was the best
02:09:09 PCP intro
02:09:10 And I agree it was yeah, that was that was very good. This is like an original. I haven't seen this. Yeah
02:09:18 Well, I sang over I sang over a piece from the ruby the ruby writer song, but I changed the lyrics
02:09:24 Yeah, I just made like two lines
02:09:26 It's like I mean it had a lot of charm and I really liked it
02:09:29 It was really good
02:09:29 I just was humming that song in my head and I thought about the PCP and then much like Christian
02:09:36 Weston Chandler thinking about Sonic and
02:09:39 Pokemon and wanting to make an album cover with
02:09:43 Combine the two together
02:09:45 Perfect melody to represent the PCP. What's that? All right, it's gonna go like
02:10:04 Yeah, we've got one more over here from actually two more all right, this one's from a Sasuke zero pro
02:10:10 And it's called a PCP theme boy. Wait hang on the fucking go over here and
02:10:18 Go
02:10:28 I'm listening to the PCP
02:10:41 I don't even care if we keep the guitar part. Yeah, ten out of ten. Oh my god
02:10:48 Guys click on the Robo Nazi techno state chat and look at the album art cover for this
02:10:53 Um, I mean obviously they just did a little thing here
02:10:56 But I I love the aesthetic of like husband comes home
02:11:00 But oh actually wait no the wife is apparently the breadwinner here and this is say at home dad
02:11:06 And she came home
02:11:08 The British she did not pick up the groceries because she was distracted listening to the PCP
02:11:13 Oh, man, this one is by far my favorite. I want it on record. This is the best one. I said so
02:11:18 Well, you got the just vote. I don't know if I get a vote, but this one is my favorite
02:11:24 This one is I think for once. Oh my god
02:11:28 Oh great way has been lifted and suddenly for the first time for the first time in my young life
02:11:33 I feel like I finally could actually see this at the beginning of a fucking PCP episode
02:11:39 The first one and I mean it uses the existence
02:11:43 To sound like an intro. Yeah, this is the first one that I unambiguously feel like
02:11:48 This would just and who else would bring it to us, but Sasuke Uchiha himself
02:11:56 The competition is over. Okay. Goodbye
02:11:59 Later, dude. Well, I mean that was fucking awesome, but we got to give I guess we'll give the next guy his affair shake
02:12:09 This is
02:12:11 Eric C base at Eric C base with a crazy X. This is apparently his third submission. Oh, I recognize this guy
02:12:18 Okay. Yeah, let's let's play this and there it goes
02:12:22 I
02:12:26 Like this hard-thriving beat. It's good
02:12:31 Bass
02:12:32 Good walking down the street with the pace a pay at my back back back back back
02:12:39 Yeah, I mean and then we were like fade out now I
02:12:45 Want to hear like a new wave
02:12:52 This is third version of this
02:12:59 I still like yeah, he got the
02:13:03 Yeah, that's pretty good. That was the best version of that for sure. We had we had yeah
02:13:08 Yeah, this is I'm sorry that this is we had a version to this one. Well, yes, we did like two versions
02:13:13 Yeah, I I mean I don't remember them well enough to be able to say which version I like the best
02:13:19 But you know, I still like yeah, I like that song with some like like
02:13:25 Interpol style vocals, you know like some I went to the store and I was procrastinating like that kind of
02:13:34 I mean that'd be cool. I
02:13:37 Mean I liked it. I did I mean we're starting to get a bunch of like good things in here
02:13:42 That's a good. That's a good. That's a good tune and it would and it's a good and we got oh
02:13:46 I just remembered digi you said you were gonna enter. Yeah, I sure did say that
02:13:54 Well, you got to 31st buddy
02:13:57 All right. Well, that that's all the
02:14:00 Because I actually am satisfied enough with an entry at this point
02:14:04 Yeah, there you go even even a couple of options, but I mean, you know just think about that aesthetic
02:14:09 You got us the stay-at-home dad is just he's like oh when's honey get so sad and lonely
02:14:14 She came home like shit faced out of her mind did not get the groceries did not pick up the kids from from daycare
02:14:21 Because she was listening to the goddamn PCP. It blasts her mind. It blitzed her chakras
02:14:26 She didn't have time to think about other shit. I I love this aesthetic. I'm way into it. I'm way into that
02:14:34 Hell yeah
02:14:35 There's there's no argument Lord of this one Lord of this one. Yeah. Oh, it's that's good shit. It's strong
02:14:42 You know, it's it is really strong contender oblivion buddy
02:14:45 You got your real submission you got you got a serious contender here to fight with but I'm sure we're forgetting like currently some like the old
02:14:52 You know dope ones that we said we're like this is the best one. I got to go through all of them and yeah
02:14:57 Yeah, all those suck now
02:15:00 I'm gonna I'm gonna put together like a playlist like the best ones and listen to for a while to figure out
02:15:04 Which is actually the best
02:15:05 Yeah, I mean, I definitely want to read you haven't done. Yeah, good. Good. I definitely want to re-listen before I cast
02:15:12 So, I mean, okay, so we're done with that shit. All we got left is our is our little question thing
02:15:16 We've got to throw a bone to the old page
02:15:18 I got one right now. All right
02:15:20 Cicero asks and I'd be shocked if we've never answered this before but I don't remember if we did
02:15:24 How do you all deal with writer's block or other blocks when trying to be creative for me?
02:15:30 Switch mediums like I I've you know, it's which genders. That's what I do
02:15:36 Like if I can't think of any YouTube videos
02:15:39 I will then go and work on like a song or write something or just do something else creative because like, you know
02:15:47 There's no sense beating your head against the wall
02:15:50 Like if you don't have an idea you don't have an idea
02:15:54 So like it's time to do something else and I granted you could just as easily go, you know do something in your
02:16:00 Like something that's just totally unrelated to creativity, but for me. It's just like, you know, I'm I'm
02:16:05 Proficient in multiple fields. So I just go and do a different thing my answer is that there is no simple answer
02:16:11 And I think it's something I've said on this on this podcast before, you know
02:16:15 There's lots of competent artists out there
02:16:17 And then there's lots of competent artists out there whose job it is to do that art
02:16:21 And I think that my stance is that the real dividing line between a professional artist and just someone who does art
02:16:29 Sometimes because it's fun the amateur is
02:16:33 Their ability to stay motivated and inspired because like you can be like a pro artist in any medium and be really successful
02:16:40 But a lot of people in the peanut gallery could think a lot of people could do that a lot of people with the same level of skill
02:16:47 Basically what I'm saying is that anyone with a with a minor amount of skill can make something really great
02:16:52 sometimes when the inspiration happens to strike and
02:16:56 I think that is what artists who get paid really get paid for is to learn it's like 50% of the job is learning how to
02:17:02 Control your own inspiration, right?
02:17:04 So I don't think there's anything simple that will work in all purposes
02:17:07 And I think that as the years go on I get more and more attuned to how to
02:17:12 Modulate inspiration like oh and you just reminded me what what the most common advice that writers give is read
02:17:19 like yeah, I mean for me if I go if I consume almost anything and I'm thinking about
02:17:26 It at all. I'm probably gonna get some kind of idea, you know, especially if it's something good
02:17:30 And I mean for an adult just mean that in terms of like oh if I watch enough anime
02:17:34 I'll find something to analyze like if I watch enough anime
02:17:37 I might see an idea that sparks something within me
02:17:41 You know or if I if I go read a book that is from a favorite author and I try to like imitate a technique of theirs
02:17:48 You know like yeah
02:17:50 There's just just constantly have your eyes open
02:17:52 I would say if you go out of your way to hone the skill of inspiration and motivation
02:17:58 Modulation it can get pretty easy to control basically before this podcast started
02:18:02 I was looking at my empty Photoshop document thinking okay. I need to draw a level right now
02:18:08 Not feeling it and I knew I knew that if I go wash dishes
02:18:13 While specifically listening to mr. B tongues video about the great infinity engine do over
02:18:18 I know for a fact that I will walk back to this screen
02:18:23 Totally motivated to do it and I was right
02:18:28 I would say that um a lot of the time I
02:18:33 The way I get through
02:18:36 You know a problem like the reason I don't work is because I'm not sure what to do next
02:18:41 It's not usually because I have no ideas. It's like I have my idea of I'm like how do I do that?
02:18:46 Usually with drawing or with like a video edit like how do I convey that how do I write this next part of the script and
02:18:54 The best way to get through that is to ask like the very basic of questions get to the very base root of
02:19:01 What you're trying to do and the reasons why it's not working, but it's hard to do that normally
02:19:06 So I like to take a long shower and just like okay. What am I trying to do right now?
02:19:10 Why am I not doing it? Is it because I just want to watch more Tim and Eric probably
02:19:15 Okay, stop doing that. We didn't talk about Tim and Eric. God damn it. All right next time
02:19:19 We didn't next we talked about Tim and Eric every day
02:19:23 Like yeah long showers and like just asking yourself asking yourself simple like questions
02:19:29 Methodically going through until you're like, okay
02:19:32 I think I know the solution to my problem and it's to go
02:19:36 You know either research something or look into something or just you you get inspiration
02:19:42 Maybe because you weren't your mind was muddled with other things and if you if you ask the questions
02:19:48 You'll you'll get to something you'll you'll have a direction
02:19:52 Logically your way through it like oh what texture do I put on these walls?
02:19:56 Well, hold on. What was the last wall?
02:19:58 Well, the last wall was polka dots and the wall before that was stripes
02:20:01 So I guess zig-zag
02:20:03 I think it's just a lack of a loss of focus and when you really focus back
02:20:07 I'm glad sometimes it takes like you can go to like the very
02:20:11 Like like logic your way into like a really very specific very core thing like why do I want a texture on the wall?
02:20:19 You know like what is the purpose? What is the purpose of drawing it like this?
02:20:23 What's the purpose of this paragraph? Do I even need it?
02:20:26 And if I do need it then I have a better understanding of what I'm doing. Yeah, I'm glad we're talking about writer's block because I'm currently
02:20:33 I know that in one sense it's not real kind of but at the same time
02:20:37 It's very real in another sense and in that fake sense. I am dealing with it right now with regards to into a very specific thing
02:20:44 I got asked to write
02:20:47 This is kind of interesting. So I'll say I got asked to write um a comic for the official zone tan like
02:20:56 comedy
02:20:57 comedy strip thing and
02:21:00 It's hard. Do they like give you specific parameters or like what Mary Mary?
02:21:06 This is this was Mary weather who invited me to do this and he showed me some of the he showed me like the first strip and
02:21:12 Which is not which has a totally different format than the one I was asked to write
02:21:16 So it's not much help and then he showed me the script for the second strip, which also has a totally different format
02:21:22 Like it's supposed to be a comedy, but it's supposed to be a comedy, but I don't know I I don't
02:21:29 I don't I don't get it. I feel like maybe needed more and kind of hash it out the project
02:21:36 Maybe I do sounds like yeah, I'm I'm it's okay to ask questions if if if the if the only like
02:21:42 Way to understand it is to ask them what the deal is then I would say it would be
02:21:47 Unreasonable of them to ask you to do something and then
02:21:50 For you like and then not allow you to ask for further clarification
02:21:55 I don't think there's any more information to be gained like I don't think there's more that they could show me
02:22:01 If if the first two are so fundamentally different does it not stand a reason you could just do what you want?
02:22:09 But what do I want what do I want to zone tan getting
02:22:13 Or something all got him joke and then write a comic about that joke
02:22:18 Oh, I never thought about
02:22:22 That's something I've been like
02:22:23 Developing around okay in the last several months. Well ever since reading Homestuck, okay
02:22:28 People have this idea this this writing principle called the rule of cool
02:22:33 Which is in a lot of dumb action movies
02:22:35 Is it like does it always work logically? No, but if it's cool, then yes
02:22:40 It does work logically because the rules of this universe is what is cool and from reading Homestuck
02:22:46 I learned the rule of fool, which is that if you can make a joke out of it. It works
02:22:52 Any problem you have if you can that's just the rule of funny. Yeah, there's already a word
02:22:57 Is that well, I hear by recall it the rule as a former as a former hardcore troper as a former hardcore troper
02:23:04 I'll tell you that yes
02:23:06 This troper would like to add that there are actually many variations of the term the rule of funny
02:23:11 There's there's no way I just remembered another way I deal with writer's block
02:23:15 This one doesn't make as much sense to most people but it somehow always works for me
02:23:20 Which is I'll go on twitter and just ask something like what should I make a video about?
02:23:26 And then I'll get like a hundred responses. None of them will be good at all
02:23:31 But like the frustration I feel towards that fact will inspire me to come up with something
02:23:36 It reminds me why you're the one with the youtube job
02:23:39 Yeah, it's I do it probably like once every month or two and it always works
02:23:45 Hey, here's a here's a quick tip just on the on the thing
02:23:47 What would gib said about breaking down the the problem?
02:23:50 We've got writer's block and busting through it by breaking down the components and figure out exactly what you're trying to do
02:23:55 That helps for me. I get stuck more at the like I know what I got to do
02:23:59 I just like oh god, I have to do it now
02:24:02 And the way I fix that is I I I do what gib said break it down to the smallest bits
02:24:06 I do step one whatever it is. I'm just like I'll just do step one once. I'm doing step one way easier to like
02:24:14 Only guess that is by far the most important step. I was yep. Yep. I will say definitely
02:24:20 Opening the program is never step one. Do not trick yourself into thinking that is step one because you will just have the program open all day
02:24:28 And then you will not do it. I don't think the program tends to work for me
02:24:31 Although I tend to just not close my programs
02:24:33 I mean sometimes it works, but like I I have fallen into the trap of thinking that opening the program is enough
02:24:39 How many times how many times you guys open the program? You've got it open and you're looking at you haven't touched it
02:24:44 And you're like, well, I've been doing this for hours and nothing's changed. What the hell
02:24:49 I
02:24:50 Once I put pin to paper that is step one and then I'm good
02:24:54 for me when I when I like uh
02:24:56 When I lay in the first clip usually I'm shocked by
02:25:00 How much like it take like how much I've already done
02:25:04 Yeah, let's say you have a five minute video and
02:25:07 Like you lay in the first clip and it's 10 seconds and you're like, oh
02:25:12 That's already like that's like 10 of the video or whatever it is. You know, yeah, exactly
02:25:16 And you see it in one sixth of one fifth. So that's one thirtieth of the video
02:25:21 Which is not so bad because that means like if it only took me like five seconds to lay this clip in
02:25:25 That just means, you know, what's 30 times five? No one knows we speculate to this day
02:25:40 I also edit like preposterously fast. So for me, it's like as soon as I have
02:25:45 Done like sometimes I'll say something like okay
02:25:48 I just need to do like the first two minutes within this hour and then I'll do those first two minutes in like 20 minutes
02:25:54 That's the way to do it. Well now I can edit the rest of this
02:25:57 I totally edit by percentages like my encouragement level my heart meter is definitely
02:26:03 Keeps up with like I go by like I do the zoom out and I say, okay
02:26:07 I've edited this much of the total audio that's laid out. That's 20% done. I got 5% done just now
02:26:12 I'm on track. There's another 10%
02:26:14 That's uh, it really helps me like see that I'm making progress as I'm doing right now
02:26:19 Doing youtube and you know while also balancing another job at the same time
02:26:24 I pushed my bed my bed, which doesn't have a frame. So it stands up about two feet
02:26:30 into my desk
02:26:32 fell asleep
02:26:33 And now the technique is that beginning to work on the next video is literally the first thing I do when I wake up
02:26:40 That's what wait. Wait. Did you interesting that that that works so well for me?
02:26:44 That that is so great and such a great feeling when you do it when you follow through with it
02:26:48 But I know I don't have it. That's healthy. You should only do that when you're like, no, no, no
02:26:52 And it doesn't matter
02:26:55 And I got to talk about it because uh while maize mom was staying at our house for a while
02:27:00 Which she was uh like to help her like acclimate back to being human
02:27:04 Uh and being in society, right? Uh she kept talking about this speech
02:27:09 To make your bed speech. Have you guys heard of this? I know. Oh, is that a jordan peterson thing? No, that that's no
02:27:15 It's it's it's all that's clean the room. Sorry. My mistake
02:27:18 It's a super super famous speech that was given at a college by I think like a military guy or something
02:27:23 But yeah, the the premise of it is that if you make your bed first thing in the morning
02:27:28 Then you will already have this sense of having done something. Yes. Yes. Yes
02:27:33 And not only that but like if you were to go out and have like a bad day
02:27:38 You'll come home and you'll see your made bed and be like, yeah, I did that and like it's you know
02:27:43 So I think that as someone who who doesn't give a fuck about making your bed
02:27:48 Probably at the very least you're you're doing the same principle
02:27:51 You're getting the ball rolling so early that like throughout the entire day. You'll always know I already did something
02:27:57 That's exactly why I need to get myself into a place of life
02:28:00 Yeah, I always make a point to do something satisfying as soon as possible. I was just saying specifically rolling
02:28:05 The monitor is like an unhealthy practice because it's literally
02:28:09 Your screen I'm sure this applies to everyone but artists specifically always say like, you know, you got to do like a war
02:28:14 You had to do warm-up sketches
02:28:15 You spend like a couple minutes you do warm-up sketches and then and then you start drawing the real shit
02:28:20 What that's how you do it you do a warm-up sketches and then like I've done something today and I'm ready to go
02:28:25 That's fine and all but what may and I have to do is in like we've been waking up and just
02:28:30 Immediately going to the gym like that's exactly what I was gonna say. That's do not collect
02:28:35 Straight to the gym and the reason is like not only do you have that sense of accomplishment?
02:28:40 But like when you hit the gym so early that you forget about it like your whole day is a blessed day
02:28:47 It is a blessed day when you've done it crazy. You've already got your blood moving. You're already like circulated
02:28:52 It's easier to eat healthy
02:28:53 You know because you get home and you want to just smack down some protein
02:28:57 It's like you like if you go to the gym
02:29:00 I've discovered this the hard way if you go to the gym first thing in the morning
02:29:03 And then the first thing you consume is mountain dew. It will feel like poison
02:29:08 Like it hurts to have consumed because your body is so desperate for nutrients after that workout that it's like
02:29:14 You have to put something good in there or else it's gonna hurt. So like it's trained me to
02:29:20 Be in a mindset of just like living healthier and doing more every day. I've been seriously considering
02:29:27 I've always loved um like doing an early morning walk
02:29:32 Even before pokemon go if you can believe that
02:29:34 People walk before pokemon go
02:29:37 Yeah, but like uh, I would get up and I would go and I would go
02:29:41 With the purpose of like seeing the sun in a way in like
02:29:45 Custing shadows in a way that I don't usually see it's like that's that's cool
02:29:49 And then I come home and I'm like hungry the whole time
02:29:51 I'm like I'm really hungry and then that motivates me to cook my own breakfast because no one else is up
02:29:56 And I I need a big something or other. So like it's it's two things
02:30:00 It's like I get some exercise in and I also make my own breakfast and it feels great
02:30:06 Yeah, uh, do we do we want to do uh, how how much longer do we want to go?
02:30:10 My eyes are starting to really hurt fair enough
02:30:12 I've got I've got one question the pity question over on the on the twitter here that won't take long
02:30:17 Um, this is from uh lex paradox
02:30:19 I just gotta say it's such a shame because we actually have like a decent handful of good questions this time
02:30:24 But it's like the show that ran so long
02:30:26 That's true. I don't even want to bother with them, but maybe we'll get to some of these next week or something
02:30:30 I mean that they're all still there if you had a good question restate it next time. Yeah, that's a good idea
02:30:34 um, uh, uh, so at lex paradox asks um
02:30:38 Um, was there a defining moment nat when you turned into the chat you are today and for the rest
02:30:44 Would you say when would you say you turn into the beta virgins you are now?
02:30:48 Wow
02:30:50 I'm sensing a fight. I'll tell you this there was no moment. I was born this way perfect walking
02:30:56 I fucked the bitch on my way out the vagina and i'm fucking one going back
02:31:01 Aka the vagina of the earth, which is my grave. Uh, that's
02:31:04 Yes, that's what I fucking I got lost. Yeah, all right. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Um
02:31:12 How am I supposed to answer this question? I any answer you give is a question
02:31:17 Uh, uh, uh, when did you become the beta virgin you are now?
02:31:22 Please comment. Oh, I was it was 40 years ago today. I remember it like I signed that illicit contract with the devil
02:31:28 Damn it. I got this lustrous mane of hair, but dammit a perma virgin for life
02:31:33 I I I signed I signed the the the the beta thing and then and then vhs one in the end
02:31:43 Oh, yeah, same tbh
02:31:47 I mean I've got I didn't even look at any other questions. So should we just wrap it up here?
02:31:51 Hey, I I see a question blue blue nimbus asks can we get another speedrun race and the answer is
02:31:58 Yeah, we we have had one that we were gonna do for a while, but we all fell off the wagon and
02:32:03 Uh, I'm still interested in doing which one so I'm uh, I'm not gonna say it, but we'll talk about
02:32:12 It is I mean, I think it's in I just put in the main chat. I just oh you mean we're gonna play
02:32:19 Hey
02:32:24 Actually that would make sense
02:32:26 Undertale would make sense. Yeah, I mean it's not that long to be real. It would be well
02:32:32 There are things in that game that it would make sense to try to race to do first
02:32:37 Snail race. I mean, yeah, you're right. You're right
02:32:40 Um, who can seduce story?
02:32:43 Or or is it? Well, yeah, the point is we do want to do more. Uh, I yeah, yeah
02:32:47 This was like a couple months ago. It got brought up the next one got brought up and we all agreed that year ago
02:32:52 I feel yeah, I suggested no suggested this game
02:32:56 I mean, when was the curvy race? Yeah, when you first suggested it
02:32:59 But like it was yeah shortly after a little after the curvy race maybe a month after the curvy race
02:33:03 We were like guys what race we're gonna do and then this one came up and we all agreed on it
02:33:07 And then nobody we'd not I distinctly said I was too busy. So I was just put myself out of the curvy race
02:33:12 Was literally a year ago. There you go. There you go
02:33:17 I mean, I'm counting there. They are difficult to organize because
02:33:23 Rules and such it takes work. Yeah, Nate and it's like do you
02:33:28 Run the game a million times and then submit your best time or do we do it the first time?
02:33:34 That's not even a question
02:33:36 I know but like how long should there be like and how it's it's not as simple because people have different approaches
02:33:43 I mean, I would prefer it to be everyone on the level playing field i.e.
02:33:48 Just do it like a like snap your fingers and there you go
02:33:51 Someone should just say and I'll I'll say right now. Here's what it should be this game
02:33:56 Someone should design some
02:33:58 Reasonable point that is like the the the end goal like what you have to do and just say what you want the rules to be
02:34:05 and like like, you know
02:34:07 You want it to be such that
02:34:09 You are allowed to do it like five times only and you can like get better and then that's it
02:34:15 Who can beat the dancer first? Oh, man, that'd be
02:34:18 That wouldn't take that long. I don't want to get dark souls three. I'm done. I'm done with souls
02:34:24 embarrassing
02:34:24 All right, whatever the point is that we want to do more we'll talk about I just wanted to
02:34:28 Ask that question to reignite to reignite that extinguished spark of speedrun races because I really like them
02:34:34 And I want us to do that one. Yeah, the only reason I like haven't been gung-ho is because of
02:34:39 The autistic amount of time. I mean I've worked really hard on the dark souls and I just know that I suck at this particular game
02:34:46 That it will be hard as shit. I suck at this game too. This is not my kind of game
02:34:50 But I think it'd be fun though, right? I can probably I think I think it would be fun and I think with
02:34:55 Effort like think about it this way whatever game it is. I've been thinking about it this way
02:34:58 like my computer now can handle it's like that's a plus and like uh, uh
02:35:04 To to do a speedrun of any game and to like figure out like what the things you need to do
02:35:08 Like you will when you play a game for the first time you like everything you're doing is blind
02:35:13 And you have no fucking idea what you're doing to play a speedrun is you like you learn the mechanics inside and out
02:35:18 You have to know. Yeah, you know everything. You know everything. Yeah, so, uh, I mean, I mean
02:35:23 Yeah, the the the reason I don't like necessarily to do that's not bad
02:35:28 I would just see to do a race when I don't know the game and I have to play it over and over and learn everything
02:35:36 It's like
02:35:37 I I'm not as invested and therefore I am at a disadvantage against you and then so I don't even want to try
02:35:43 Or I mean this this game has a certain member who is a particularly bit of an expert on the subject
02:35:48 So, uh, I gotta say that does have a somewhat diminishing spark in me for like well
02:35:53 I mean I couldn't try really hard. Yeah, but that person will also put less effort into practice
02:35:57 No, no, no, no possibly true. I
02:35:59 It's not like it doesn't matter if you're good at this game because the speedrunning is like a totally different. I guess you're right
02:36:04 I don't I don't I don't see that as being like an issue. Well, whatever. Let's talk more about it
02:36:09 I want to kind of get into specifics just for fun, but uh, you know, whatever. Yeah, all right. I think all right
02:36:13 I think that's that. Yeah. All right, everybody. Thanks for listening to this
02:36:19 Hang on we gotta do patreon.com
02:36:22 Slash the procrastinators one dollar you're in the chat five dollars bonus episodes. Uh, that's what's up and you are fucked

02:37:02 Myself. I'm sucking
02:37:05 I am an asshole. I am a stupid

02:37:21 What the hell
