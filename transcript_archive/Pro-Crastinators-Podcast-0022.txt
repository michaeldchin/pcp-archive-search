00:00:00 Man, fuck school. Fuck school. I don't even know what these guys fucking said about fucking
00:00:15 school, but... Man, my fucking experience with school sucked ass. School's the reason
00:00:22 I wasn't able to be on this fucking podcast. That's why I'm doing this stupid, faggy record
00:00:27 by myself down in the fucking basement like a piece of shit thing. So this isn't even
00:00:33 gonna fucking... I'm not even able to know what the fuck anyone was saying. I'm recording
00:00:37 this fucking like a week after everybody else fucking did it. And it's all school's
00:00:42 fault. All right, so fucking... I mean, I'm not even like too pissed off about it anymore.
00:00:49 If this was like three or four years ago, I'd still be salty as fuck, but now I'm just
00:00:52 kind of like fucking disappointed. School just seems like such a waste of time, a waste
00:00:58 of effort, and most importantly, a waste of fucking money. And there was so little preparation,
00:01:03 so little understanding of what college in particular... I'm assuming we're talking about
00:01:09 school, we're talking about college, we're talking about high school as well. I think
00:01:11 high school's a necessary evil, but it's desperately in need of some sort of reform. Remember to
00:01:16 be a little bit more effective. I think education as a whole, like, even needs to decide we're
00:01:21 gonna go for like the fucking like, you know, classic Greek Academy style of school where
00:01:26 you're actually trying to elevate people to be the most intelligent they can be, or we're
00:01:28 going to say, fuck it, school isn't for intel intelligence, it's for preparing people for
00:01:32 the workforce, in which case we need to understand that school needs to be more specialized because
00:01:37 people's careers are specialized and we're wasting so much time doing all this fucking
00:01:41 bullshit, like, 80% of it we're never gonna use in our vocations. So we need to decide
00:01:45 just in general what we need to do with school, but that's neither here nor there. I'm gonna
00:01:49 rant about how much I fucking hate school. I don't know, I just, I guess maybe that does
00:01:55 kind of lead into my experience with school is that so much of my time spent in college
00:01:58 was doing classes that I had no interest in, and have zero application in my life today.
00:02:03 And the same thing can be said with high school. I think, you know, elementary school, middle
00:02:07 school, and even to an extent high school, a lot of the subjects that you do in school
00:02:12 are very much necessary, you know, to create just sort of the basic core education of a
00:02:18 human being. But I think a lot of the stuff, I should probably turn the second sound off.
00:02:23 Wow, my phone and my fucking, all of you shut up, all of you fucking shut up. I'm trying
00:02:28 to be intelligent and you're ruining it. God, turn off none. No, no, don't bother me.
00:02:35 What was I even saying? There's so much of school that is done almost like for the sake
00:02:40 of dick wagging than like actual application, you know, like I, I went to school for graphic
00:02:46 design. I guess I'm an artist by trade quote unquote, in terms of what my education should
00:02:50 be and we can get into that later. But I had to take like all this math shit that I'm never
00:02:56 used, you know, even like high school math, like nobody ever fucking uses it. It's really
00:03:00 interesting because I took you take all these math classes. And then I have the interesting
00:03:06 perspective of like reflecting on that. Because I have a younger sister who's you know, I'm
00:03:11 27. She is 14 right now. So there's 10 years sort of difference. You know, I can kind of
00:03:20 see her going through all this shit in high school that I did. And then my dad and like
00:03:26 me having to help her with math homework and all this shit, and just like asking about
00:03:30 all this math things that none of us use, nobody uses any of this shit. And that kind
00:03:36 of goes back to where I'm saying about specialization, like if you're going to go into math, like
00:03:41 if you want to be a mathematician, and like who really fucking knows what they want to
00:03:44 do in high school, right? But but let's say, let's say for shit and giggles, you did, you
00:03:49 know, that would be important. But there's there's practical math that were never taught
00:03:55 in school. And this is why I think like the whole kind of like romantic, you know, Greek
00:04:00 Aristotelian Academy kind of school is just not even true anymore. Because if you wanted
00:04:05 to really empower people, if school was really a way to educate you, and make you a well
00:04:10 rounded person, why don't we have more practical skills? Like why don't we learn how to balance
00:04:16 a checkbook? Why don't we learn about, you know, taxation and tax laws and how we can
00:04:21 you want to take math, like let's let's learn how to balance your budget. Like that's
00:04:24 something that everybody in the fucking world needs to do is like, understand, let's have
00:04:27 classes on how debt works, how fucking, you know, applications of interest work, how bank
00:04:33 works, how you taking a loan and things like that, like practical math, if I need to sit
00:04:37 there and learn math, I want to learn math that I'm going to use in my life. And school
00:04:43 doesn't do that. You know, we have like this we've romanticized the STEM fields, but at
00:04:48 the same time, such a small percentage of the world actually uses STEM field knowledge
00:04:55 long term, but we hammer away that and make it so much more important, you know, and at
00:05:00 the same time, we kind of poo poo on the arts and stuff. And like that's always the first
00:05:03 thing to get budget cuts. But I think a lot more people, you know, or maybe not a lot
00:05:09 more, but just as many people would go into the arts, they wouldn't do STEM fields, but
00:05:12 the STEM field is so much more fucking grandiose, and it's sort of like position. But from a
00:05:18 culture perspective, we don't really we ignore STEM fields, and we, you know, fucking rock
00:05:24 stars and movie stars and shit. So the arts is respected culturally, but not intellectually.
00:05:28 And that's kind of weird. I would say it's definitely harder to be a scientist or a
00:05:33 mathematician or a physicist than it is to fucking play music or anything. But there
00:05:36 are two different kind of applications, and they take two different kind of mindsets.
00:05:39 I'm fucking going all over the place. But school fucked me over. Because I think there's
00:05:46 a lot of pressure, at least there wasn't my house to go to school, to continue my education,
00:05:52 even when I wasn't sure if I even wanted to do that. I knew when I was a little kid that
00:05:55 I wanted to do storytelling in some fashion. And I always fancied myself an artist, even
00:06:01 though I wasn't really good. And that's kind of the weird thing is that nobody in my house
00:06:05 would just even to this day, no one has the fucking balls to say, Look, Tom, you're not
00:06:08 that fucking good. And so I know I'm not that good. But no one else will allow me to function
00:06:16 under that kind of mentality of that I'm not good. So I was forced in my house to pursue
00:06:25 art as a career, because that was something I'm interested in, even though I wasn't sure
00:06:30 at the time, it was something I wanted to do. I knew I liked it. I knew I enjoyed drawing.
00:06:36 But I knew I wasn't good at it. But I wasn't good at anything else either. Like I was good
00:06:41 at playing Devil May Cry and drawing shitty comics. And that was it. So I really don't
00:06:45 have anything in terms of like applicable life skills. So I guess to some terrified
00:06:51 parents looking at their 18 year old son, who did nothing but play PlayStation and draw
00:06:56 terribly like the no eSports weren't a thing. So they couldn't funnel me into that nowhere
00:07:00 they probably want to. So I was the only thing they had to do. So I started applying to a
00:07:08 bunch of colleges for art and they all rejected me because I wasn't fucking good. And I knew
00:07:11 I wasn't fucking good. And so what I wanted to do is I wanted to take a year off of school
00:07:17 and just like work on my portfolio. Like if this is what I'm going to do, you know, I
00:07:21 guess I should work on my portfolio and maybe like figure out if this is even what I want
00:07:25 to do with my life because I don't fucking know like I'm a retarded kid. I all I did
00:07:29 to play PlayStation for like seven years straight. Like I don't fucking know what I want to do
00:07:33 with my future. But you know, the parents wouldn't let me do that. You know, they threatened
00:07:39 to like, you know, kick me out if I didn't go to school because they knew they're like
00:07:42 we're all fucking study show that if you don't go to school right at high school, you never
00:07:46 go. It's like, Well, maybe because those people realize it's not for them. But I never got
00:07:49 the chance to do that. So I ended up going to a really shitty school just because I kept
00:07:53 getting rejected from all these schools I was actually interested in. But the one school
00:07:57 I was really wanted to go to was the Center for Cartoon Studies in Vermont, which is a
00:08:03 two year program for learning how to do comics, which is like the thing I was really interested
00:08:08 in. And it was right in Vermont, there's only like a couple of states over. So it wouldn't
00:08:10 be that far away from here. And like, I was like really gung ho about that. That was like
00:08:16 the one time during my senior year of high school that I was really interested in like
00:08:20 college was like, I will continue my education. This sounds cool. Like this sounds like
00:08:24 something I would be interested in. But the one time I showed interest, the parents had no
00:08:29 interest because they were just like, this is comics, you're never going to get a job with
00:08:31 this is stupid, we're not going to cosine loans on this. So don't bother applying. And I guess
00:08:37 loans lead you to the fucking money aspect of it. I'm $40,000 in debt. I got a terrible
00:08:41 education because I went to a shitty school that I didn't want to go to. And I went to
00:08:46 school for graphic design in 2007, which was probably the worst year to go into that fucking
00:08:50 field because in 2007, the iPhone launched and the iPhone changed the entire design landscape
00:08:59 because it went from shifted from print and web being two separate things to like everything
00:09:05 being web based everything being app based and because everything became app based and
00:09:08 the web exploded in terms of complexity, designers also have to be programmers now. If you want
00:09:14 to get a design job, you have to do all of the graphic stuff, all the layout stuff, but you
00:09:18 also have to be able to code websites and code and WordPress. And you had to do both
00:09:24 disciplines, but I was running on 2007 level education and curriculum. So by the time I
00:09:30 graduated, I could do print stuff, no problem. But like 2011, the iPhone four s was coming
00:09:36 out. The smartphone craze was in full swing and the industry was completely different. I was
00:09:40 completely unprepared for it. And to top that off, I was supposed to I did some internships
00:09:46 at my dad's place, he worked at Hanscom Air Force Base, and I was supposed to start doing
00:09:49 design work there. But two weeks before I graduated, they cut the program. And so I had no
00:09:56 job. So I wasn't looking for a job. So school just kind of fucked me over. So now I'm 40k
00:10:01 in debt. And all I can do is make YouTube videos that I don't even like doing, because
00:10:06 that's all I can do to make money. And I didn't get a good education because I couldn't get
00:10:11 into a good school because I wasn't good at the thing I was actually passionate about. I was
00:10:15 not allowed the time to get good at it, to get into a good school. And I probably wouldn't
00:10:21 even have gone to school anyways, because I've always wanted to be kind of an internet
00:10:25 entrepreneur, because that's the thing I kind of grew up doing was watching YouTube playing
00:10:28 video games, and drawing shitty little comics. So I just got kind of forced on the stupid
00:10:34 fucking path that I didn't want to do. And I've just kind of come to resent school as
00:10:39 a result. It just it fucking sucks. It sucked for me, you know, I just feel like I think
00:10:45 too many people go to school because you're supposed to, when so many people probably
00:10:50 don't. And I think even now with the fucking economy, the way it is, doesn't even matter
00:10:56 anymore. Does it's like school worth it? I think if you're going into a STEM field, school
00:11:01 is definitely worth it because the returns there are still big. You know, especially
00:11:04 if you're a woman trying to get into a STEM field, you got a fucking golden ticket right
00:11:08 there, you know, that feed that field starving for women, you're going to get into school,
00:11:13 no problem, you get, you know, bonuses and like fucking scholarships and whatever to
00:11:17 get into school. And like, it's going to more than pay off because those fields are hugely
00:11:22 fucking, you know, the salaries for those are massive. But like, if you're an artist,
00:11:28 if you're a creative, like, do you really need to go to school now? I think even now,
00:11:33 like you look on shit like LinkedIn and you look at like artist profiles, like people
00:11:37 judge you by your portfolio more than anything else. If you can fucking sit, stay, stay at
00:11:42 home or stay, you know, just go live on your own, work a shitty job and just grind out
00:11:48 a fucking beast portfolio, you can probably land a job somewhere at a smaller design firm
00:11:53 or a smaller company doing graphics work, or doing websites or whatever. And your experience
00:12:00 will build your portfolio and your resume at that point, and you never need to fucking
00:12:03 go into debt in the first place. This industry is evolving at such a fast pace, especially
00:12:09 now that it just seems ridiculous to go into that much debt for a field that like is mostly
00:12:15 freelance now, so you're never really going to get benefits. And even if you do that,
00:12:19 it doesn't pay that much shit doesn't really pay that high. So I don't know, man, like
00:12:26 I just feel like everything I did in relation to school is a mistake from just like not
00:12:30 paying attention in high school and not learning that shit to going into fucking college, even
00:12:35 though I knew I really didn't want to and I wasn't ready going into a field that I knew
00:12:39 I wasn't good enough for but everyone else wouldn't let me believe that for the sake
00:12:42 of my views, even though I was the only one being realistic. So and then I just feel like
00:12:48 school in general is caught in this weird middle ground of like wanting to be kind of
00:12:53 this Aristotelian greatness sort of thing, but also understanding that it's really just
00:13:00 designed to fucking have people like make good grades, fucking good do good on SAT scores,
00:13:06 so schools can get fucking more funding, and just prepare them for a fucking menial job
00:13:11 that 90% of their graduates are going to eventually fall into just because that's the way the
00:13:15 world works. So I don't know if this fucking fits with the podcast at all. Maybe it was
00:13:21 kind of depressing, but that's my thoughts on school. Nate, have fun figuring out where
00:13:28 this is supposed to fucking go. Hello and welcome to this week's episode of the pro
00:13:32 crest and natives podcast here. Once again is me and all my buddies. I'm the best guy
00:13:38 ever bestie boy.
00:13:39 We got the 21st century digital boy Digi bro over here. We got patron. Oh, he's still
00:13:49 going. Patreon.com slash Ben St. Patreon.com slash Ben St. That's that that meme ain't
00:13:58 going anywhere. And we have the Davoo collective. What's up, buddy? Every nuclear bomb has a
00:14:04 silver lining depending on the inflation rates. Yeah, Hiroshima has some really great
00:14:09 earthworms now. All right, so thanks for joining us again. Once again, folks, and we're here
00:14:15 to talk about a topic that, oh man, the passions are running so high in here. Some of us have
00:14:22 a healthy relationship with this. Most of us do not. I know, and it is. No, go on, go
00:14:27 on. Okay, I'm just going to say it is, in fact, a schooling with a particular emphasis,
00:14:33 I think on higher education, but we'll touch on the whole system. Let me let me just let
00:14:37 me just say, sure. We know a lot of our viewers are younger. We have some we have, you know,
00:14:43 some high school age viewers, I think, and to all those ones who might be wondering about
00:14:47 their future and wondering what direction in life they should take. Let me just say,
00:14:52 don't listen to your parents. Don't listen to your guidance, counselors and religious
00:14:56 authorities. Listen to this now. Yeah, this is the real deal. We've had real life experience.
00:15:02 All those religious authorities in your life, they all come from a previous generation before
00:15:08 this system got to be unbelieved. That is very true. We are all from your guys' generation.
00:15:12 We know what's up. I mean, I'm not me personally, but these guys do. I was being partially satirical.
00:15:17 Well, you can take it at your own risk. We are not professionals. You follow our advice
00:15:24 at your own risk, but here's my general advice, guys. I do not think that it is super beneficial
00:15:31 to go for a general education sort of thing. I would highly recommend you have a specific
00:15:37 plan in place with, like, action points there so you can guide yourself to what you're going
00:15:42 to do and go to, like, a community college. And hopefully by the time, you know, you guys
00:15:46 are rolling into a school, maybe a fucking... I don't recommend any of that. I don't recommend
00:15:51 any of that. I don't recommend you don't fucking go to school. Don't do it.
00:15:56 That's the best plan. That's the best plan. There is no chaos. Just don't go to fucking
00:16:01 school. All right. Well, it depends what you want to do. If you want to be a fucking, you
00:16:04 know, nurse or whatever, you got to go to school, but whatever. Like, okay, let's get
00:16:09 into our anecdotal stories here. Who wants to go first? Ben, let's hear about your relationship
00:16:14 with schooling. Well, fuck, it's complicated. I'll try to condense it as much as I can.
00:16:20 So I'm, I did the pretty normal thing, you know, graduated high school, immediately went
00:16:26 to college, was, you know, for four years, got my degree in four years, graduated, went
00:16:33 on to, you know, quote unquote, join the workforce, sort of, not really. And, and, uh, all right.
00:16:44 So like what I do now is obviously not the, like I majored in physics and philosophy and
00:16:50 what I do now is obviously not the that, you know, do art and whatever. So basically it
00:17:00 had, it had no benefit whatsoever. Well, I mean, I did, I did, I did work in physics
00:17:07 jobs, like jobs that I needed a degree for a while, like for several years after school.
00:17:11 So it's not like I got nothing out of it. And I mean, more, more, more of the, here's
00:17:16 the thing, I can't, I can't extract who I am and what I do right now from my own personal
00:17:24 history, which includes having gone to college. So to me, like that decision was like an essential
00:17:32 part in becoming who I am. So I can't say no, it didn't work out. It kind of did because
00:17:37 I'm pretty happy with where I'm at right now. Yeah, but that you could say that for every
00:17:41 bad thing that happens to you. Yeah, I mean, that's true. How much do you have a lot of
00:17:46 debt or a medium amount of debt? Yeah, I do. I have like a like 10,000 or $20,000. See
00:17:52 that immediately. That's easy. That's, that's poultry. No, fuck that. Having any debt is
00:17:57 fucking disgusting. Having any debt is imperatively speaking here. Having any debt is disgusting.
00:18:02 I have like, I make so little money that I managed to get some of it. My payments like
00:18:09 deferred. So I lately, I haven't had to like pay that much back. I mean, I'm going to eventually
00:18:16 like, I mean, it's still accruing a little bit of interest. Like a couple, it accrued
00:18:19 like, yeah. So, so like it's still a problem, but it's not, I mean, I can safely ignore it
00:18:26 for right now. I don't know. I'm going to start paying it back as soon as I have a little
00:18:30 bit of extra money. Let's just, okay, yeah, that's cool. But let's hear DeVu's side of
00:18:36 it. His education experience, because this is a totally different story. Yeah. So my
00:18:40 dad was a dude who got several degrees and then realized he thought that school was giant
00:18:45 and giant gay. What kind of degree? Just had a curiosity. Like, okay. So like when he was
00:18:52 like 20 or so, he became a Christian and got into like Bible studies stuff, which were
00:18:57 like church leadership stuff that like, you know, is not necessarily as advanced as physics,
00:19:02 but stuff that does require legitimate education. Like he knows the Bible extremely well. He's
00:19:06 a big Bible otaku and he knows how to like do church leadership and stuff, even though
00:19:11 he's a Bible analyst on YouTube. Yeah, he actually wants to be. Dude, have me on his
00:19:17 co-host. I want to be in that. Well, yeah. Well, what he told me is that, hey, DeVu,
00:19:21 if you make videos, if you edit my Bible analysis videos, you won't have to pay rent
00:19:26 or pay less rent. Oh my God. That's the arrangement. Thankfully though, he hasn't, he hasn't actually
00:19:31 put me up to that yet. He's still working on it, you know. Interesting. Because he's
00:19:34 got a job, right? Can't get any internet work done when you have a job. Oh, let me tell
00:19:38 you what, that's like people. Okay, but go on. Yeah, we'll make that a whole separate
00:19:41 podcast. Yeah, having a job, the biggest problem in the universe for sure. Yeah, pretty much.
00:19:46 All right, go on, dude. How about you schoolin' now? So after all those degrees, I guess
00:19:50 he just, I don't know, I think my dad is just opposed to human institutions in general.
00:19:54 He started his own business. He just doesn't, so he did, he homeschooled all of his children,
00:19:58 including me, since I'm one of his children. Does that mean that your mom taught you and
00:20:01 stuff? Yeah, kinda. It's really weird like that, you know, because obviously part of
00:20:04 it was like religious motivation too. Yeah, yeah. That was a bit of it. But there's plenty
00:20:08 of Christian schools, like my own sister. Me and Ben went to church when we were younger,
00:20:12 with some homeschooled folks, and I never quite understood what was going on with that. Yeah,
00:20:16 hey, I didn't have a choice. I had to fucking go where my parents would literally murder
00:20:19 me, so, you know. Yeah, they would've fucking, they would've fucking Abraham and Isaac'd
00:20:23 their ass. They would've sent us to the hell that we so longed for by choosing not to go
00:20:27 to church, but, alright, go on, dude. Yeah, so, like, it was just, in general, my dad
00:20:33 just doesn't like the idea of school as an institution. He thinks it's kind of a waste,
00:20:36 right? Okay, hey, I wonder where you get that idea. My younger sister, who's 12 right now,
00:20:40 is so much like, she needs a social environment in order to learn. She just needs a school
00:20:45 system in order to even, like, be productive. So after like a year of, like, my dad just
00:20:50 trying to keep her out of this one Christian school, she's just like, she wasn't getting
00:20:54 anything done. She could not focus, so he finally brought her back. And my sister hates
00:20:59 all of her classmates. Whenever I talk to her, she goes on and on about how everyone at
00:21:02 her school is idiots, but she needs that environment in order to function. Interesting, okay. So
00:21:06 those are the kind of people for whom school is required, and I guess those are the kind
00:21:10 of people who invented school as a thing, right? Yeah, you know, there's different strokes
00:21:14 for different folks. It's the Aristotle model, you know. You all get together and you fuck
00:21:17 each other and you occasionally learn something cool. Right. That's what school is like. That's
00:21:22 what college is like. That's it. So I think that the two different like versions of homeschooling
00:21:29 that people are able to visualize is either no one ever gets anything done because it's
00:21:33 impossible to motivate yourself at home. Yeah. Or everything is extremely strict. I don't
00:21:38 know anyone who is like either of those extremes, because I know a bunch of homeschooled kids
00:21:42 because that's the environment my family brought me up around. You've got a little brother
00:21:46 though too, right? Yeah, my brother was also homeschooled as well. Yeah, okay. I think
00:21:50 we definitely leaned more on the never getting anything done side because me and my brother
00:21:54 are both, I mean, my brother particularly, I think actually has dyslexia. He can't read
00:21:59 super fast, even though he's very smart. And even though obviously I'm a genius of all
00:22:03 times, I can't, I can't focus. I can't learn anything in like a coherent way. And it's
00:22:10 written in a Thomas Sowell audiobook. Yeah, right. You know, stuff like I just, you know,
00:22:16 even that if you wanted to like do a test on me to like remember specific names, there's
00:22:21 no reliability with my ability to remember specific names is not intelligence. It's
00:22:26 dumb bullshit. They make you do it. Right. But now here's what I want to get into, right?
00:22:30 Because like, because as I've been getting into YouTube and really, really admiring the
00:22:34 like vast knowledge of people like James Rolfe or even movie Bob, but like particularly
00:22:40 Jesse and Digi over here, Jesse who has an unbelievably broad knowledge of things and
00:22:45 Digi who has a unbelievably deep knowledge of things. And I, you know, I came to realize
00:22:50 that neither of them learned those things in any sort of way that they'd be able to
00:22:53 take a test on. Like imagine if they wanted to do an anime like school, it'd be like,
00:22:58 all right guys, today we're going to study Nietzsche Joe. You need to all memorize the
00:23:02 names of the staff members who worked on Nietzsche Joe and remember the air dates, the
00:23:09 air dates of each episode. And so you'd spend all week just learning a couple of random
00:23:14 facts about this one show. And you know, and like, whereas like all these anime analysis
00:23:20 people on YouTube who have all this knowledge, they just got it from like going on Mal or
00:23:24 anime news network and this just looking at random shit for like an hour every night.
00:23:28 It's amazing what the human mind can do when it has passion for its subject.
00:23:33 I look back on like how I like history. I think history is fascinating. I just hate
00:23:38 learning history the way school wants me to do it. Right. So like, because like the way
00:23:41 the idea is the right way to learn history.
00:23:43 Yeah. Um, like, okay, because like, so my mom basically just gave me pre-packaged curriculum.
00:23:49 Like she didn't do a whole, like, you know, she was fairly hands on, but it wasn't like
00:23:52 she was composing curriculum herself. So she just like gave like here, here's a CD that
00:23:56 teaches the sixth grade, put it in.
00:23:57 I'd like a hands on education from your mom.
00:24:04 So I basically, I basically got a standard curriculum in a way, right? So I know exactly
00:24:09 how all that goes and I know how tedious it is because it's like, I'll, I'll get a history
00:24:12 textbook and I just have to remember all these arbitrary names of things. And it's like,
00:24:16 you know, in the same amount of, think, think about this, think about it this way in the
00:24:19 same amount of time it would take to have a teacher explain to you what you're going
00:24:23 to learn and then go home and then read the chapter over and over again to make sure you
00:24:26 remember it and then do the homework and then like go do the tests and then like pace around
00:24:31 hoping you got the test right and then looking at the test in that all that time, you could
00:24:35 just read half the entire textbook.
00:24:38 You know, you can just get so much more done. Like if you are the kind of person who just
00:24:42 can just read stuff and like remember like 30% of it, that's a totally valuable piece
00:24:47 of knowledge. And like if I were to go back to myself as a kid, myself as a kid who always
00:24:51 wanted to be able to read, I mean, I'm a good reader. I always liked reading. I just always
00:24:55 was bored by all the books I had at my disposal. I just didn't find any books I liked. And
00:24:59 I was always like upset about it. If I could have talked to myself, I would have told myself,
00:25:03 just read the first chapter of every book in the universe, just read the first chapter
00:25:07 and stop as soon as you get bored because you could be like the knowledge guy and get
00:25:11 other people to read the books for you. Yeah, I mean, I like reading. I just think that
00:25:15 books are boring. And by the way, I attribute that to God. God denied me good books because
00:25:19 all good books have like spells or magic or violence in them. I wasn't allowed to read
00:25:24 Harry Potter.
00:25:25 Oh, yeah, that's true.
00:25:28 Well, yeah, but it's just one book. You get tired of it eventually. I told my parents
00:25:32 that last week. No, I'm not doing another Bible study. I've studied the Bible enough.
00:25:35 I'm done with it. Oh,
00:25:36 dude, nice.
00:25:37 I mean, yeah, it's true. Like it's just like how the heck are they still not bored of that
00:25:40 one book? But like Harry Potter, right? There were stories in the news about kids being able
00:25:45 to finally get into reading because of that book. And I heard those stories on the news.
00:25:49 My parents were there. They knew that me and my younger brother were both not really able
00:25:53 to get into books, but that 0.0000003 percent chance that reading them would get us into
00:25:59 witchcraft was just not worth taking the risk. Let us be stupid instead.
00:26:03 Listen, listen, dear viewers, messed up, but hey, that is just that is just the first
00:26:07 example of how school is fucked up our lives irrevocably or irrevocably. And there's
00:26:14 that. I figured it out.
00:26:19 My biggest concern with this podcast is that we are going to make ourselves look like fucking
00:26:24 idiots somehow and convince everyone to go to school.
00:26:29 Like if anyone is like actually smart, someone who could actually like take tests well and
00:26:34 then is able to like really get a hold of their life and get a good paying job and just
00:26:38 like work at it like crazy until they pay off all their debt, you know, clearly the higher
00:26:42 education system will probably work out all right.
00:26:45 The higher education system does work out well for some people. There's no my good buddy,
00:26:49 Michelle. My good buddy, Michelle is now she's like 25 like me. She's married. She has been
00:26:56 a nurse like since she was 21 or whatever like after she graduated and she's just been
00:27:01 on the ground. Her student loans paid. She now owns a house with her husband. She's married.
00:27:07 She's I'm sure she's working on having kids like she's got herself a good situation going.
00:27:11 It's like the thing you gotta learn is that you gotta learn hard. You gotta know when
00:27:14 to give up. Like that's another thing I would have told myself as a teenager is hey, by the
00:27:19 time I was like by the time I was in eighth grade, math was just beyond me. I could not
00:27:24 follow it anymore. I would stare at a problem for an hour and a half and not be able to
00:27:30 do any of it. I would just not be able to figure out at all. It was, I just couldn't do it and
00:27:34 you know, I have, I programmed, I made an RPG like all by myself. It's buggy, but it works
00:27:40 most of the time. I made an RPG because I can do some basic
00:27:43 allergy when I what multimedia fusion, a program where you do need to do the programming
00:27:49 yourself. So, but like, yeah, like I can do math. It's just that the way that math is
00:27:55 taught is terrible. And Maddox was talking about this. And I think in one of the, one
00:27:58 of his bonus episodes of his podcast with Dick rest in peace, biggest problem about
00:28:03 how that math is taught terribly because all they do is teach the formulas. It's like if
00:28:07 you taught history by just telling you like the formulas of how history.
00:28:14 Look, I got better stuff to say. Let's, let's take a little break from Davoo.
00:28:18 I'm going to segue this back into other stuff about homeschooling, right? Cause like Maddox
00:28:22 would also talk about how like he, he brought in homeschooling as a problem one time.
00:28:26 They made a bunch of really good points, like how the parents will now monopolize the way
00:28:30 that that kid is raised. You don't get to have a diversified portfolio of authority
00:28:36 figures as you think that is indeed true. And he talked about how, cause like I think
00:28:39 people are concerned about the homeschooling thing cause a lot of it is for religious reasons
00:28:43 and a lot of times I was like, Oh, well, are they going to like deny evolution and stuff?
00:28:46 Like, are you not going to learn about that? Well, in the case of, um, cause I think this
00:28:50 is worth talking about on this podcast, right? In the case of my family, what they did was
00:28:54 they had this DVD that explains why evolution is not real, right?
00:28:58 But like, right, right? It was like this, this movie is like this documentary cause it talks
00:29:02 about the flagella motor, which was this, this one device in a cell that's like, when
00:29:08 you look at it, it's like so fucking complicated. There's no way it could just be put together
00:29:14 randomly. And then of course later on, I look on a YouTube video of some lecture of this
00:29:17 guy being like, Hey, you know that flagella motor that people make a big deal about? Here's
00:29:21 this other motor that's exactly the same minus two parts.
00:29:24 Yeah. So it evolved into it.
00:29:26 But the thing is, the thing is though, through that documentary, I learned everything about
00:29:29 what evolution was. And then it was just later I had to learn the reputation to it. And then
00:29:34 I was completely on page with everyone else.
00:29:36 So then it's like, there's a thing called critical thinking that can help.
00:29:40 Right. Critical thinking. The biggest solution in the universe, no joke. So in general, my
00:29:44 stance on school is that it should just be whatever the heck you want it to be. And that,
00:29:48 you know, like homeschooling might be the best way. But like, you can, you can get plenty
00:29:52 of social interaction with homeschooling because like you have all this time on your hands.
00:29:55 If other kids are not always in school, there's plenty of kids to hang out with. It's not
00:29:59 really. So are you in favor of homeschooling?
00:30:01 I got 100% of my social interaction from school. I honestly can't imagine like a life without
00:30:07 having gone to school. It just seems totally alien to me.
00:30:10 Right. Well, here's what that's like. It's sort of like couples who get married early
00:30:14 into their adulthood. And then some of their friends don't get married. And they're like,
00:30:18 how could you not be married? Because my whole life is based around my family now. It's like
00:30:22 with school. It's like, because you have to spend all your time there, of course, most
00:30:26 of your life happens there when you don't have to be there.
00:30:28 There are young ladies at that school I went to, numbs and dog, numbs and dog.
00:30:33 Yes, you have made yourself perfectly clear, best guy ever.
00:30:36 Yeah. I had plenty of social interaction. I just, I'm just awkward because of awkward.
00:30:40 You know what they say about high school girls? I keep getting older and they stay the same.
00:30:44 Let me break into this topic and say that on the, like education in general, right? I
00:30:49 think, I mean, yes, some people can succeed. And like you said before, some people need
00:30:56 that like social school environment to learn. I know that in discussion of like, like a
00:31:02 lot of people ask me if I went to art school. The answer is no, by the way. And on the subject
00:31:07 of art school, he went to fart school. This comes up a lot. People want to know, like,
00:31:13 is art school worth it? And the answer is like, you don't need to go to art school to
00:31:18 learn art. You can learn art on your own, but you have to be self motivated to do it.
00:31:23 You have to. And like the other benefits of art school that you can't get on your own
00:31:28 are like social networking and like meeting people and other artists in the field and
00:31:32 also that like structured environment that will like, here's where I'm going to break
00:31:36 it. That's a good point. Give me the in here. Okay, but I have to continue that point in
00:31:41 a minute, but go ahead. Well, okay, you just continue yours because I'm going to fucking
00:31:45 tell you. Well, that bit about being self motivated is really important. I mean, I think it applies
00:31:51 to all schools, right? And like all education. Yeah, we can get self motivation working.
00:31:55 The rest of this will work. Like, okay, in our society, a degree is important, but a
00:31:59 degree is kind of arbitrary. And without the degree, all a college is is just like, they
00:32:05 give you books and they bring you into a group setting and someone talks to you and tells
00:32:09 you stuff, right? And like anything you can learn in the classroom, you can learn on the
00:32:13 internet or by yourself or somehow you just have to be self motivated, right? You can
00:32:17 Google it. Like, if you like, if you really want something like Digi, you've talked about
00:32:22 this with like making videos, right? Like, no, you didn't go to school to learn how to
00:32:26 make a video. You just looked at other videos, figured it out. And because you wanted it,
00:32:30 you made it happen. You like, by whatever means necessary. And like with learning, it's
00:32:35 the same if you want to learn something, you're going to make it happen. You got to be, you
00:32:39 got to be passionate. Like, that's the thing, Ben, I think that the problem here is that
00:32:45 the same self motivation that would drive you to learn this shit on your own is the exact
00:32:52 same one you need to even be successful at school. So in the end, if you're so self motivated
00:32:59 that you could actually do well in college, you can just teach yourself shit. Like, okay,
00:33:04 my good friend, my good friend, Don, son, who I bring up all the time in some of my podcasts,
00:33:10 because he's a super fucking intelligent guy. This is a dude who had to he actually had
00:33:15 to drop out of high school because the fact that he had cluster headaches, which is a condition
00:33:20 where every morning he's so dumb, he dropped out of high school law every morning, he would
00:33:25 wake up and have like a size migraine that made it so he just couldn't do anything for
00:33:30 like hours on end, right? Yeah, yeah, made him a Hickey Comery. He stayed in his room
00:33:35 throughout the last two years of high school. I met him just because he happened to come
00:33:39 to school like two times. And one of those times he had a lucky star book. And I started
00:33:43 talking to him. Okay, so he's the guy. Now I'm connecting the name with the story. Okay.
00:33:49 So Don son, when I met him, he was in my Japanese class. He already knew how to read and speak
00:33:56 Japanese because he looked it up online. And he taught partly is because he'd seen every
00:34:02 anime ever. So he had some good roots in there. But like immersion learning or whatever. Yeah.
00:34:08 He learned, you know, just by just by looking at shit, he would read Japanese, like he learned
00:34:14 the basic symbols, then would read manga to pick up on some of the kanji. Like, you know,
00:34:18 a lot of manga has furry Ghana, where it tells you what each kanji means above the kanji,
00:34:23 if it's like a shonen manga and stuff. So he learned through that. The dude knows how
00:34:27 to do anything involving like building computers. He's like a super he knows a lot of computer
00:34:35 hardware stuff. And he knows everything about like networking, like he specializes in networking,
00:34:40 like computer networking is in connecting to the internet and shit like that. Right, right. And
00:34:45 he's super passionate about that stuff. And so ever since I've known him, he's been my tech guy. I
00:34:51 refer to him as my tech guy, because I don't know any of that shit. And I'm not at all motivated
00:34:56 to learn it. So anytime I have a technology problem, I come to him, you know, he's helped me
00:35:00 build computers. He's helped me figure out all kinds of new layouts for, you know, making our
00:35:06 house capable of having internet because it's too fucking big. This dude knew everything, right.
00:35:11 Then he got his cluster headaches got cured not too long after he was like 18 or 19 through magic
00:35:19 mushrooms, incidentally. Really awesome. It was an experimental medication. Did you know that if
00:35:23 you lock arms around a retarded girl and scream nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare,
00:35:28 it'll it'll cure her retardation. Yeah, that's on that's on record. Oh my God.
00:35:36 That's like why the only one laughing at that. I don't I don't know what what.
00:35:44 All right. Anyways, never mind. This dude, he got his cluster headaches cured. So he went to
00:35:50 college to community college, right? Because right, right. He he actually like, because he got his
00:35:55 GED, right after dropping out of a high school, he had never like he didn't study any of this shit.
00:36:01 He just like walked out, took the tests and got like perfect scores on all of them because he
00:36:05 knows everything. He's just a fucking genius, right? So he perfect scores all his GEDs. He goes
00:36:11 to college. He takes two years in like, you know, networking and computer fucking learning shit.
00:36:18 He gets his associates. He already knew all the stuff like he literally went to school as a
00:36:23 formality because he needed the degree in order to be hired. But he already knew all the things
00:36:28 he was learning. He already he got like a million qualifications, like took all these, you know,
00:36:34 tests for qualifications and stuff. He just knew all this stuff. And yet he still can't get a job
00:36:40 because nowhere in the field of fucking computer technology will they hire you unless you have
00:36:47 five years of experience. How do you get those five years of experience? Nobody fucking knows.
00:36:53 You could do an unpaid internship. Oh, great. For five years. Unpaid internships are such a
00:37:01 crime. They are the biggest meme that needs to die. They're destroying America as far as I'm
00:37:06 concerned. But you know, I got a buddy get away with that. I've got a friend, Rich, who went to
00:37:11 school out west in Seattle at like a heart. This place called DigiPen, which is like a hardcore
00:37:16 gaming school that like if you work there, you will get a job at Nintendo or like or one of these
00:37:21 gaming schools or gaming companies or whatever. And it's just he went to school with this guy,
00:37:25 Quest. That's his actual name, just pretty dope. And I know, right. And like Quest went there with
00:37:32 him. Quest was an awesome programmer went there for two years. It's a four year degree just dropped
00:37:38 out immediately got hired and has been doing that ever since he's been living the good life.
00:37:42 It's his last name, apostrophe revenge, probably probably.
00:37:47 So my what I was getting to there is if you're the kind of person if you already have like if
00:37:53 you're if you're graduating high school with a 3.5 grade point average or higher or even a 3.0 or
00:37:59 higher, like you have the mindset that you could succeed in college. But if you applied that
00:38:05 mindset to something you want to learn, then you will probably learn that thing. I think the
00:38:11 people who need to go to college, there's two types. One is if you have if you're trying to get
00:38:17 into a field where you can't do it by yourself, like my brother Victor, he's trying to become a
00:38:22 filmmaker. And I mean, it's possible to learn how to make films on your own. And there are some
00:38:27 directors who have done it. But like just even being able to handle the kind of equipment you
00:38:32 need to make real movies, which all of the equipment is at minimum $40,000 a piece. Yeah,
00:38:38 collected all on your own unless you're fucking rich. So in order to even have exposure to the
00:38:44 tools, and because you need a crew to be able to make a film, it's almost impossible to learn
00:38:49 that specific skill set without going to college, which is why for someone like Victor, it's good.
00:38:55 And then I think the other people who need to go to college are the ones who all they have is
00:39:00 study skills. Like if you graduate high school, and your skills are that you know how to study,
00:39:06 then you can go to college. And it won't matter what curriculum you take, because you'll probably
00:39:11 succeed at it. And I think that most people who become doctors and stuff, those are the kind of
00:39:15 people they are. They're people. Yeah, you know, my dad and my mom both didn't know what they wanted
00:39:20 to do specifically when they went into school and figured it out. And I've had great careers. I
00:39:24 mean, I had no idea what I wanted to do when I went into into college. Like I got there. And at
00:39:31 some point, I kind of decided that physics and philosophy were the mostly physics. Basically,
00:39:36 I just I chose that while I was there. And then I just kind of went with it for the foreseeable
00:39:42 future. And I mean, a lot of people, I mean, did you say that like, if you didn't go if you're
00:39:47 good enough for college, you could apply that knowledge to something you want to do. But what
00:39:51 if you don't know what you want to do? Or you want people who don't know what they want to do,
00:39:57 and or people who aren't that self motivated, you know, it's like, okay, people say, well, at
00:40:01 very least, school is a great way to get you to be motivated, right? Well, getting a job, even a
00:40:07 dumb job would probably do that just as well. If not better, I don't think it's good to be, I don't
00:40:12 think it's a good thing. And then guess what, here's the job. Oh, I fail. I don't care. You know,
00:40:17 right, because there's a thing though, right, a job, let's say, let's just say all things are
00:40:20 equal, that it gives you the same amount of inspiration or the same amount of like, allowing
00:40:25 you to eat up time while you decide what to do with your life. You'll walk away from a job with
00:40:29 positive money instead of negative money. That's the most important thing. That's like such a huge
00:40:35 difference. If college were free, I would say, yeah, if you graduate high school and don't know
00:40:43 what to do, and aren't that self motivated, go to college, but like Bernie 2016. Yeah, like it cost
00:40:50 so much money. So like, I don't, I mean, I feel like my college take my takeaways from college
00:40:56 were overall pretty positive. And yet, can I really justify all that in light of the like $20,000
00:41:03 I have yet to pay back? That's the question. I don't know. I really don't know. Because like my dad,
00:41:08 like right when he started a business, like 10 years ago, he started making me come to work
00:41:12 every once in a while, like once a month or so, like, Hey, David, or Davoo, which everyone I don't
00:41:17 know if I'm going to be like Maddox, where all my family members call me by my username.
00:41:20 Did they do that to his family members call Maddox now?
00:41:23 Well, like when he talks about his family members, they call him in his imaginary imagination. But
00:41:29 anyway, he started the window cleaning business. So I started like learning how to clean windows
00:41:33 by the time I was 13. And I was able to do it pretty well by the time I was 15. And then when I was
00:41:38 like 17 and a half, he made me start doing it full time. And it took me like, you know, three and a
00:41:42 half years or four years to finally make enough money on YouTube to break out of that. But the
00:41:46 point is, like if for whatever reason, like the internet just died, like like the internet just
00:41:51 all fried, there was no way to make any money off of it anymore. I would be able to like even
00:41:55 to and then let's say my dad's business just went under because no one wants to work for it, even
00:41:59 though he does a great job. I would be able to get a job doing like any sort of blue collar
00:42:04 thing, or that involves like getting on ladders or cleaning windows or like doing gardening. I
00:42:08 would know how to do that. Even though I would hate my life and want to die every second of my
00:42:13 life, I would be able to do it and like do it in a way that would like be friendly and like I'm
00:42:18 able to work really well when I'm at work because I have that experience. And meanwhile, like even
00:42:22 though I hate cleaning windows so much, and it's the most unsatisfying thing in the universe, it
00:42:26 is 1000 times more unsatisfying than 1000 times more less unsatisfying than figuring out when two
00:42:34 trains that don't exist will cross one another with cargo at 3pm.
00:42:38 I think the biggest problem here, I think the reason that college is so over glamorized in our
00:42:44 society is that everyone thinks that you need college to get a good job, to get a high paying
00:42:51 job. That's the meme. The imagination of it is that you get this high paying job. But the fact
00:42:56 is that blue collar jobs don't pay badly necessarily and there's a lot of jobs you can get with no
00:43:04 college education that you can make a lot of money doing and also an electrician or a plumber
00:43:09 people. Yeah, you'll be great. You'll be in great shape. Yeah, and it's also fun and cool to do
00:43:15 those jobs. You're building fucking houses. You have a life skill that will always be useful for
00:43:19 the rest of fucking time. But like, you know, like, I think, okay, here's here's my perspective on
00:43:27 all this because I want to I've been like a dragon in the waiting for like this whole time. Like
00:43:32 the same way I just want to just bite the head off of this whole entire school meme. There's a
00:43:39 meme that needs to die. Yeah. Like, in my experience, all of my friends went to college and
00:43:45 none of them have done shit with it. All of them are working normal ass jobs. I have a couple of
00:43:51 friends who just graduated who have like ideas of what they want to do with their degree. But like
00:43:57 overall, Victor is the closest anyone is to doing anything with it. He graduated and he's doing
00:44:03 film work, but he can can barely get paid. He can barely find work can barely get paid doing that
00:44:10 work. The only way he will have like an easier end would be if he went all the way out to LA
00:44:15 where everyone's trying to be a filmmaker. So good luck, you know, fucking tiny fish in an
00:44:22 enormous pond. But it's like impossible for any of these people to get work. And yet, my dad, who
00:44:30 he went to, he dropped out of high school. The second he turned 18, he got his GED, and he joined
00:44:37 them the Navy. He was in the Navy for six years. He got I think like two years of college
00:44:43 education in the Navy. I don't know what he studied like he didn't I don't think he majored
00:44:47 anything. I don't even know if he graduated or got marine biology, but he was in the Navy for all
00:44:55 this time. And then, you know, him and my mom were just working kind of like odd like my mom and dad
00:45:00 have always just been managers at like wherever they work, because they're both extremely hard
00:45:04 working and goal oriented people who love to be on top. Like my mom loves to be in control. Your
00:45:10 mom loves to be on top. Too easy. Too easy. She, you know, they both were always managers in like
00:45:20 in managerial positions. And then my dad started working for a car dealership, which anyone can
00:45:26 do. Like as long as you have the personality for it, it's really just a matter of being able to sell
00:45:31 shit to people. He became a car salesman, which is an impressive skill, by the way. It's a good
00:45:36 thing to have. Right. And he he had no idea how to do that. Like my dad, this is how, because most of
00:45:43 the salespeople are like very money motivated, like go getter type people who are very like sly and
00:45:50 shyster type people who built America. So they're exactly like me is what you're saying. Only better
00:45:56 in every way, Ben. Right. Only they can actually do their job. My dad's a super honest guy. He's like
00:46:01 the opposite problem right there. But here's the way that that one of his friends who he met in the
00:46:06 car business, who both of them went on to become general managers, he's he described my dad's
00:46:10 technique as talking at people until they're so confused that they just buy the damn car. Oh, yeah.
00:46:16 He's like me where he'll just keep rambling on and on about it. And then eventually, oh my god,
00:46:21 you're talking about fine. K on his deep Jesus. Imagine as a salesman, Jesus Christ, I would do
00:46:27 anything to shut you the fuck up. I was almost gonna. I almost took that job. My dad almost got
00:46:32 me a job as a salesman. But imagine you looking like you do now. Yeah, no way. But yeah, like he
00:46:40 he's just a guy who just like wanted to work very badly, applied himself to this job with all he
00:46:47 had. He was employee of the month every fucking month forever, and then rose up the ranks and
00:46:51 became a general manager. And he makes a stupid amount of money. He makes way more money than
00:46:55 anybody else I know, or have ever known or likely will ever know unless I start rich people, you
00:47:02 know, like,
00:47:04 well, we we can't all be managers, though. Right. But the thing is, I'm saying that like, it's
00:47:09 possible to to never go to college. And yet, I mean, he, yeah, it's possible. But is it the likely
00:47:17 outcome for most people? Well, you know, what also isn't the likely outcome for most people doing
00:47:22 anything with your college education, right? Now, here's no one does anything with it. There's
00:47:27 like a lucky few who accomplish anything. That's a bit of an exaggeration. That's not an
00:47:32 exaggeration. Almost everyone drops out. You don't go into a field directly related to your major. I
00:47:40 mean, I think most people who get degrees still end up in, you know, maybe not necessarily better,
00:47:47 but in some thing that needed a degree to get into. Well, then it's kind of worse. Let me cut in
00:47:53 for a second. I mean, the what I do for like my tutoring job, I needed a degree to do it, technically
00:48:00 right. All the jobs I had before were things that I only got because I had a degree, like having
00:48:04 a degree. I mean, it's I don't disagree with any of the stuff you're saying to disparage it. But it's
00:48:09 true that having not having a degree disqualifies you from a lot of potential things. But also
00:48:15 disqualifies you is just not having knowledge. Like it like with the electrician job, like you
00:48:20 would be amazed how much that doesn't matter if you have the degree. My current job is a perfect
00:48:25 example of that. I just when it comes to getting jobs, it's all about credentials and knowledge is
00:48:31 not a credential. You know how to program. Do you even know what is a program? I do know what is a
00:48:37 program. But the idea was that you come on. That's the amazing thing that I learned, like with some
00:48:42 of these jobs, once you join like a like a real job in a company that like will give you benefits,
00:48:47 all that stuff, they will train you to do the job. So what's even the fucking point of the
00:48:52 education? Well, here's the thing. There's a big there's a big fallacy about in our society that we
00:48:58 had about college degrees that formed over the course of 120 years, right? Now, this is a bit,
00:49:03 this is going to be pretty conjecture, but I'm pretty sure of it. Anyone feel free to correct
00:49:06 me. But okay, back in the day, the 1800s and the early 1900s, having a degree meant that you were
00:49:13 either really privileged or a genius and or an incredibly hard worker, right? And then you were
00:49:19 an exceptional individual, right? Yeah, this is what we now this led to what we call the fallacy
00:49:23 of composition, which is what's true of one person is true of the whole. For example, if you
00:49:28 were in a stadium and you stand up, you can see better. But if everyone stands up, none of nobody
00:49:32 can see better. If everyone runs out of a burning building, they all get stuck. But if one person
00:49:36 runs out, they'll do great. So back in the day, a few people got college degrees. It meant they were
00:49:40 better than everyone else. So you were more hireable. But when everyone has a college degree, it no
00:49:45 longer means you're exceptional. It means you're hopefully competent. So now all it's done is it's
00:49:50 created this artificial need to have a degree just to prove that you're even like capable of doing
00:49:55 anything. So now it's like we've basically we've duped our society has duped ourselves into you
00:50:02 have dozens of thousands of dollars in debt to be proven as competence. And that's a pretty messed
00:50:09 up. Alright, alright, alright, let me tell you my story now. Alright, my story is the most. It's the
00:50:15 worst thing about my life, my relationship with my with my higher education. So I to went to high
00:50:21 school, same school as Ben was two years younger than him. And then I went to college with the dream
00:50:28 of becoming a doctor. So I went to school in New Jersey, with a aiming for a biology degree or
00:50:35 something, then to go to medical school later. So two years into that, I decided I don't want to do
00:50:41 that anymore. I want to be a computer science major, which was fine. Now, the biggest problem
00:50:47 along this whole thing was that I met with my advisor, like every year to make sure I was taking
00:50:54 the right classes. Nobody along that way ever informed me that no matter what I did, I would not
00:51:00 be taking enough classes to graduate on time. So when I hit that four year mark, you know, I was
00:51:05 aware I'd have to do more. But I didn't think it would be much. I thought it'd be like a year. And
00:51:09 now I'm sitting here. Well, okay, I'm doing okay now. But basically, after after everybody, all my
00:51:14 buddies graduated, I then spent I went back to Massachusetts, spent, what is it now, three years,
00:51:21 spent three years taking like a course or two a semester, working at these shitty jobs, paying
00:51:28 student loans at this point, I've got I've got like $20,000 of debt or something, haven't made a
00:51:32 fucking debt in the thing, been taking these disgusting, horrific jobs. The only thing that made
00:51:39 my life bearable was when I discovered YouTube and started doing tbap and stuff. Those were the
00:51:44 only things in life that gave me joy. My I lived with my parents, I got zero to almost no
00:51:51 puss during that time. After college, my my my hunger had awoken. It was a nightmare. And
00:51:58 have just been treading water ever since until miraculously, and this is what really
00:52:02 infuriates me. The only way I got out of this was just that my dad has had a has a good family
00:52:07 friend who just who just basically made a decree, give this kid a job at your company in Ohio. So
00:52:13 here I am, here I am with the job because it was handed to me. It's not like I earned the privilege
00:52:18 alert privilege alert. I was but that's the thing. I obviously I was I was super privileged,
00:52:24 but that should not be how it is. No one should this whole I mean, that's how it is with me too. I
00:52:29 have super privilege alert like I could just I could just move away for like five years and come
00:52:34 back and immediately start I know I don't want an unfair advantage. I don't want that for anyone. I
00:52:39 got like, like, it is kind of fucked up that like after going through all of that and that's the
00:52:45 thing. That's the thing. You get a degree that supposedly gets you a job. You just like, you
00:52:51 know, because we have this family friend. Yeah, just get you just get one. Like, and I'm just
00:52:57 juxtaposing my life. Yeah. And I'm juxtaposing my life for those three years with no more credentials
00:53:04 than I have now. Just suddenly someone just like gave me an opportunity. And now I'm doing just
00:53:08 fine. Now my life is like pretty decent, I guess. But like, there's no difference between those two
00:53:14 states of being other than someone decided to hand me shit. Like, do you understand how
00:53:18 frustrating that is? It's a nightmare. And my fuck like I've had all these problems. I've had all
00:53:24 these fucking problems like getting credits to count with like the school. And like I took a
00:53:28 class. It wasn't actually approved. That's thousands of dollars down the drain. Every time that
00:53:33 happens. I hate school so much no one should ever go if you're going to go people for the love of
00:53:39 God. Have a plan. Don't go because you think you want to figure out who you are. You're going to
00:53:44 waste tens of thousands of dollars. Just go get a job and figure out who you are. Figure out that
00:53:48 you want to do YouTube. Figure out that uploading videos makes you happier than anything else you've
00:53:51 done. Find a group of people who respect you and that you love and who are your best friends.
00:53:55 Don't go to school. Don't do it to yourself. So hang yourself for the rest of your life.
00:54:01 Ben, I believe you asked me earlier, like, are you in favor of homeschooling? I'm just in favor
00:54:05 of total, like, libertarian school choice. Just like, like the parents have to evaluate the kid
00:54:12 and decide what they think would be best. Like, okay, here's a world that I want, right? Well,
00:54:16 maybe doing math and they're not doing good at it. And then they try again, and they still suck at
00:54:21 it. And they try again, they still suck at it. Get out of math and take the kid exactly. Exactly.
00:54:27 They go, All right. Hey, guess what? You get to give up now. I would love nothing better than to
00:54:31 give up because like the thing is my parents ultimately weren't that good at homeschooling
00:54:34 because they didn't know how to do it. They were both raised. Yeah, they were newcomers too. They
00:54:37 didn't know how to do it, right? You know, especially back in the 90s, it was, I think, you
00:54:41 know, so it was a more new thing than it is now, obviously. How I want to do with with my kids at
00:54:46 least, at least at the beginning, when they're like little, is just sit them down and talk with
00:54:51 them for hours. Because I remember sometimes like talking with my dad about like, history stuff,
00:54:55 and then we like go on Wikipedia and we, I don't know, Wikipedia at the time, but we'd go on the
00:54:59 internet, look something up. That would be a perfectly fine way to like, teach your kids stuff.
00:55:04 It's just like, hang out with them for hours a day or, you know, however much time you have, and
00:55:09 just talk to them and read books and Wikipedia articles. Well, obviously, the thing about that is
00:55:12 the reason most people, the biggest reason we have public schools is because most people can't
00:55:18 raise their own kids. Yeah, yeah. Well, we got, we're trying to compartmentalize the time that
00:55:24 parents, you know, so they can grind out the corporate machine and, you know, make America
00:55:28 more money and stuff. Right. Which is the biggest fallacy in it.
00:55:30 Cat begged to get into my room. I got up. I took my headphones off, let her in, and she
00:55:35 immediately wants to go back out. You know, I like to think you're referring to like a woman
00:55:41 from the 1950s. Yo, this cat wanted into my room and now she won't even put out. What's up with
00:55:45 this garbage? Man, I'm still just sitting here just quivering with sorrow and anger from your
00:55:50 story, Nate. I'm glad. Good. Yeah. It's terrifying. Good. Don't do it, people. Learn from my
00:55:54 mistakes. Let's look at it this way. It's like you decide to drop out of math. Just drop out of
00:55:59 all the degrees. Let's say like, well, I like, well, hold on. Like I like history or I like
00:56:05 science. You can do a little bit of that stuff. But you know what I really want to do as a seven
00:56:09 year old? A song and dance man? I really love the piano. I want to play piano. All right. You can
00:56:13 just drop. I mean, not me. I'm just saying like some other kid. This is like a figure of
00:56:16 speech. I don't play the, I don't do music. This is just an anecdote, a false anecdote that
00:56:21 doesn't exist. Okay. It could be, right? This kid wants to play piano. It's like, okay, well,
00:56:25 let's say if you drop out of school entirely and don't do any work other than like a little bit
00:56:29 that you want, you could do five hours of piano a day. And that's six days a week. And
00:56:35 actually it would be seven if we killed God and you could go do it on Sunday. But let's just
00:56:40 say that we don't kill God. Yeah. Let's say there's a couple of weeks you'll take off. So
00:56:45 that's 50 weeks a year. And then what if that was the plan of a JRPG, a bunch of Japanese
00:56:52 friends get together and use the power of friendship to kill God so that they can work on
00:56:55 Sunday.
00:57:02 And then they celebrate by going to Chick-fil-A on Sunday. Yeah. By the time that kid is 17
00:57:08 around the same age, he'd be graduating high school. He'd have 15,000 hours of playing
00:57:15 piano. That's genius.
00:57:19 Ben, before you say that, just let me say that that is what my life is currently. I have to go to
00:57:24 work. Well, I see you and Digi every day working on making better and better videos and doing so
00:57:30 well. Not only am I not like working at the same rate, like not only am I not currently as
00:57:35 successful as you, you guys are like accelerating faster than me while I have to go grind away my
00:57:39 life at this job that I hate because I can't leave because I can't make enough money. We'll make
00:57:44 this a separate podcast. I'm so envious of you. We will do a podcast about this whole topic.
00:57:49 Nate, how... It's a trap. You see, my job is a trap. It was all a nightmare. I'm living in a nightmare.
00:57:54 If you subtract your debt from all the money you have, what are you left with?
00:57:59 Well, that's kind of a personal question, dude.
00:58:01 Well, I... No, I don't mind. I might, like with all the money, which includes stuff I have to spend
00:58:09 to live, like maybe it would have equaled out by now.
00:58:12 No, I mean, I mean, like right now currently... Oh, right.
00:58:16 I mean, I'm doing all right. I'm doing okay.
00:58:18 Does you having debt mean that you ultimately have negative money? Do you have an amount of debt that would
00:58:22 equal negative money? Yes, yes, I do. That is correct.
00:58:25 And Ben, I assume the same is true for you. It is true for me.
00:58:28 I have $9,000 sitting in my bank and no debt and perfect credit.
00:58:34 I'm coming for you, Digi.
00:58:36 Yeah, one of these days. All right, Ben, you were saying something.
00:58:38 Oh, fuck. Shit. What was I talking about when I was going to break in there?
00:58:43 I don't know, but I could... You better hurry, because I'm going to go on my ranch.
00:58:45 Well, move on, because I forget what I was going to say.
00:58:47 All right, all right. Forgive me.
00:58:50 Yeah, man, I'm like... I think we need to restructure all this shit. I think that...
00:58:55 I agree, man.
00:58:56 Because here's the thing. I think that for the vast majority of people, what school is, is daycare, right?
00:59:04 Yeah, yes, totally.
00:59:05 And your parents don't have the skill set to raise you or, I mean, to teach you things.
00:59:10 They're fucking parents. They probably didn't even finish school themselves, right?
00:59:14 I mean, like, what are you learning in, like, elementary school?
00:59:18 Like, when you're there and you're all sitting at desks and there's 30 of you and the teacher is talking to you for...
00:59:23 Like, do you really think you're there, like, learning every day?
00:59:27 Well, you know, guys, the one upside of this whole thing is that with, you know, automation, AI stuff and all, like, individual computing,
00:59:34 school is probably going to have a revolution in the next few years that makes it way more...
00:59:38 Whoa, that's a whole other mess. I'm going to get into later.
00:59:41 We should bring that back.
00:59:42 Let me tell you my story before everybody interrupts this with the fucking AI stuff.
00:59:46 What were you saying? What did I say?
00:59:47 I said that's way optimistic to think that there's actually going to be that...
00:59:50 There should be that revolution, but I really doubt it.
00:59:53 So anyway, school is daycare, right?
00:59:56 And you send your kids off there, they learn...
01:00:00 It's a way for them to not be around your house in danger all day and also they happen to probably be learning something
01:00:09 and maybe making friends and learning how to socialize.
01:00:12 Pretty good system, right?
01:00:14 Here's the thing.
01:00:15 At some point, you...
01:00:18 Like, when you're growing up, especially when you...
01:00:21 Pretty much when you reach puberty, when you're getting into high school.
01:00:23 Like, personally, I think that the existence of elementary and middle school is pretty justified.
01:00:30 Yeah, I agree.
01:00:31 Kids need to learn some basic shit.
01:00:34 Kids are worthless trash and they need to be held in line.
01:00:36 I do think that we're probably...
01:00:38 We could better optimize what we're teaching kids.
01:00:40 I honestly think...
01:00:41 I don't get why...
01:00:42 Like, okay, in fucking high school is the first time you can even have any classes that are just life skill classes
01:00:50 and they're always electives.
01:00:52 Like, home ec.
01:00:53 Like, why is home ec not like a mandatory middle school class?
01:00:57 They never learned anything useful in home ec.
01:00:59 Yeah, but that might just be because...
01:01:01 I just meant that...
01:01:02 Okay, I wasn't actually talking about...
01:01:04 I didn't mean literal home ec.
01:01:06 I just meant, like, that's the kind of subject.
01:01:08 Learn to cook is a good skill, though.
01:01:10 Everyone's gotta eat skill.
01:01:11 I think everyone needs to learn how to cook.
01:01:13 Everyone needs to learn how to fucking build shit and build a car.
01:01:18 We brought this up in me and Ben's podcast that I was saying that we could just make a whole class
01:01:23 around learning how to fix machines.
01:01:27 Learn computers, make a class about building computers in middle school.
01:01:31 Mandatory.
01:01:32 Everyone needs to know this now.
01:01:33 And most important of all, most important of all, there's sex education.
01:01:36 Why isn't there dating education class?
01:01:38 Why isn't there dating education?
01:01:39 I mean, once you go on three dates, you have sex, but how do you get those first three dates?
01:01:45 You gotta find out.
01:01:46 We need to teach a school.
01:01:47 How do you ask a girl out?
01:01:49 They were up to me.
01:01:51 This is a Chris Chanism, by the way.
01:01:53 I would say that the elementary school, we teach them all the basic shit they need to know.
01:01:59 Middle school, we continue to teach basic shit, and then we throw in a heaping helping of life skills,
01:02:06 which I mean, there's some in there.
01:02:07 That's when you start getting sex education and stuff like that.
01:02:09 But it needs to be a lot more.
01:02:11 We just stop beating around the bush with the sex shit and just teach kids straight up what the fuck it is.
01:02:16 I've got friends who get taught what's up, and they're much more well-adjusted.
01:02:20 We need sex in the culture and whatever.
01:02:22 Kids, we're going to stop beating around the bush.
01:02:24 We're going to beat directly on the bus.
01:02:26 Oh, god damn!
01:02:29 And we need some education on how to get a job and maintain the job and how to just be a working person.
01:02:38 I don't think you can teach that.
01:02:40 That might be true.
01:02:41 That might be true.
01:02:42 That's a complicated and diverse skill set.
01:02:45 One of my offline friends was really screwed over for a year because of that lack of being taught how to get a job.
01:02:51 When you're a kid, you see people working behind the counter at McDonald's, right?
01:02:55 And you know you aren't supposed to walk behind that counter, right?
01:02:58 That's not where you belong.
01:02:59 Some kids have a hard time even ordering at McDonald's because it feels like some social thing they're not supposed to do yet until they're older, right?
01:03:06 It's this boundary that you're not allowed to cross.
01:03:09 When you're a kid, you think of anyone who has any sort of job as someone who probably has some sort of amazing skill.
01:03:13 How do they know what all the burgers cost?
01:03:15 Oh my gosh, right?
01:03:16 Yeah.
01:03:17 So you have that mentality.
01:03:18 And when you're like 20 and your parents are telling you you have to get a job, which was the case for one of my friends,
01:03:23 I feel like a part of her problem was just general anxiety.
01:03:26 But I think a lot of it was how do you go up and say you have a job?
01:03:31 How does this work?
01:03:32 How?
01:03:33 Wow!
01:03:34 Okay.
01:03:35 I kind of know what you're talking about.
01:03:38 Here's the thing.
01:03:39 And we kind of did a little bit of this in elementary school,
01:03:42 but it would be even better if we just had a school trip where we all went to McDonald's or to a bunch of restaurants,
01:03:50 and we all just sat in the kitchen for a while and just watched what people do.
01:03:54 Oh, I see.
01:03:55 Just learn the basic shit of what's going on.
01:03:58 If you were coming here, this could be you one day, kids.
01:04:00 It would be the worst day ever for everyone who works at the McDonald's,
01:04:04 but it would help sprout better careers in the future.
01:04:07 In the Boy Scouts, we did that at a Dunkin' Donuts.
01:04:10 Oh, that's cool.
01:04:11 Good idea.
01:04:12 And I also was in the Boy Scouts.
01:04:13 Oh, yeah, I was a Boy Scout by the way.
01:04:15 Eagle Scout over here, Eagle Scout.
01:04:17 That's me.
01:04:18 Yeah, I never made it to Eagle Scout.
01:04:20 By the way, this is a big millennial thing.
01:04:22 I'm an Eagle Scout because my dad basically forced me to do it,
01:04:25 so I take almost no credit for it.
01:04:28 Anyways, I think we need success skills, general life skills.
01:04:33 And computer programming.
01:04:35 I can't even fucking fathom that at no point in all of schooling,
01:04:40 at any point, I went to fucking 12 years of regular school,
01:04:46 two years of college, and at no point did someone teach me
01:04:50 what taxes are and how to do them.
01:04:52 Oh, my God.
01:04:53 How the fuck is that?
01:04:55 How the fuck?
01:04:57 The education system is a little bit too wedded
01:05:00 to the Aristotelian model of learning general knowledge.
01:05:05 People, we need to know how to do our taxes.
01:05:07 How the fuck?
01:05:08 Every single person in America has to do it.
01:05:10 It's a government mandated thing, like you can go to jail
01:05:12 for not doing it.
01:05:13 Not really, most people who are employees, the taxes get done for them.
01:05:15 That is not true.
01:05:16 I'm an employee at a company and you've got to file your fucking taxes every time.
01:05:18 Okay, maybe that's not the case anymore,
01:05:20 but I know it's the case for a lot of people.
01:05:21 No, everyone has to file taxes.
01:05:23 Everyone has to follow.
01:05:25 Literally everyone.
01:05:26 Yeah.
01:05:27 Okay, well I don't know what the heck I've heard then.
01:05:29 I know I've always had to file them.
01:05:31 The thing is to do, everyone has to file them.
01:05:33 It's if you have a normal job,
01:05:35 which I realize you've never had like a really normal job.
01:05:38 If you have a normal job, then your company takes out a certain amount of your paycheck every time.
01:05:45 And they give it to the government.
01:05:47 And then at the end of the year, you file a tax form that tells you how much they took out,
01:05:53 and then they give most of it back.
01:05:55 However, if you're a fucking freelancer like me,
01:05:59 you have to figure out, all on your own,
01:06:02 the fact that you have to pay like a third of what you made last year to the government,
01:06:08 because no one took it out for you.
01:06:10 So you have to figure out how to give them the money.
01:06:13 And they don't tell you.
01:06:14 I mean, they invariate terms.
01:06:16 Nobody tells you.
01:06:17 Yeah, no one's like, hey buddy, just so you know,
01:06:20 tax season coming up, here's what you have to do.
01:06:23 Dude, I'm just...
01:06:24 No, they don't tell you.
01:06:25 I just knew because I knew what taxes were through television.
01:06:28 I guess it's the thing your parents tell you.
01:06:30 I mean, that's how I learned because my parents taught me shit.
01:06:32 My parents are like...
01:06:34 Your parents aren't like sole proprietors of their own business.
01:06:38 They work at places, so it's a different system.
01:06:40 And they also...
01:06:41 My parents are like...
01:06:42 They have a difficulty...
01:06:44 They've always had this.
01:06:45 A difficulty of realizing what stuff they know that is not obvious.
01:06:49 You know what I mean?
01:06:50 Sure, okay.
01:06:52 They, for whatever reason, assume that me, Victor, and Shade
01:06:55 would learn certain things that we don't know anything about.
01:06:59 You know, I kind of feel that as I'm getting older
01:07:01 and people are more retarded, as I see younger people,
01:07:04 it's hard to know.
01:07:06 It's really...
01:07:07 I have some sympathy for that
01:07:08 because I don't know that these fucking kids don't know what like,
01:07:10 I don't know, a VHS tape is.
01:07:12 Right.
01:07:13 Some shit like that.
01:07:14 You know, whatever.
01:07:15 Yeah, it's like you take certain things for granted
01:07:17 because you know how to do them
01:07:18 because you've been doing them forever.
01:07:20 But like, I have no idea how my parents learned how to do taxes
01:07:23 but it wasn't until like, I had to pay taxes
01:07:26 and I came to my parents like,
01:07:28 what the fuck do I do?
01:07:29 There's some things that were like expected to absorb
01:07:32 through like the osmosis of life.
01:07:34 I mean, I always assumed that the fact that I didn't absorb those things
01:07:38 like how to do taxes, like how to hold it regularly,
01:07:41 I always just assumed that I was just a little autistic
01:07:44 and that I was just this wrong.
01:07:45 No, no one learns this stuff.
01:07:46 No one teaches you it.
01:07:47 I mean, control the spectrum.
01:07:48 I just figured I was a little more on the spectrum
01:07:50 and everyone else figured it out.
01:07:51 I know exactly what you mean, Ben.
01:07:53 And I think everyone assumes that they are the idiot.
01:07:57 Like, I must be the idiot.
01:08:00 I kind of remember the figures around my dick quote.
01:08:03 Well, I must be the idiot here
01:08:05 because I had it in my head
01:08:07 that the tunnel between demon world and human world
01:08:09 had been sealed.
01:08:11 No.
01:08:12 I think everyone just assumes that there's certain shit
01:08:21 because I've had that experience plenty of times
01:08:23 where I'll have a friend who I might say something like,
01:08:26 oh, this is how much is minimum wage or something
01:08:31 because I have no idea.
01:08:32 Or I'll ask somebody like, hey, what's a huge question I had all my life
01:08:37 and I only learned it in the last couple of years
01:08:39 is what is a normal amount of money to make?
01:08:42 I have no idea.
01:08:44 Well, there's no real answer to that question.
01:08:46 When you fill out those surveys,
01:08:48 because I used to buy a lot of DVDs
01:08:52 and they would come with these little surveys
01:08:54 that you're supposed to mail in.
01:08:56 And I never would mail them.
01:08:57 I would just fill them out because I'm a fucking weirdo.
01:08:59 So I filled out all these surveys
01:09:02 and they would always have a question that's like,
01:09:04 what is your house's annual income?
01:09:06 And I had no idea
01:09:08 because I don't know what my fucking parents make.
01:09:11 I don't even know that shit.
01:09:12 Yeah, and so I would just stare at it
01:09:14 and I'd be like, well, what's normal?
01:09:16 Because it has this enormous gradient
01:09:18 from like $12,000 at the bottom to $250,000 at the top.
01:09:23 And I had no concept of how much money is $12,000
01:09:27 versus how much money is $250,000.
01:09:29 Oh, well, you're a kid, sure.
01:09:30 I really didn't grasp it until I had money.
01:09:34 And it was really the moment when I started,
01:09:37 like once I got up to like minimum wage,
01:09:40 like through Target and then through YouTube,
01:09:42 like then I would look at,
01:09:44 like I found out how much my dad makes
01:09:46 and like did the comparison that it was like 30 times
01:09:50 what I was making and I was like, oh,
01:09:52 so he does make a lot of money.
01:09:55 Oh, so this is like, this is what entry level is.
01:09:58 This is what most people are making, like this amount,
01:10:00 this is minimum wage, this is the common amount.
01:10:03 Like, oh my God, now I understand what money is,
01:10:06 you know, but it took so long and like so many years
01:10:10 of not getting it and like my entire appreciation
01:10:12 of what my parents were doing all this time
01:10:16 would have been totally different.
01:10:18 If I had any understanding of money,
01:10:20 it would have totally changed my perspective on things.
01:10:22 I guess I thought that those things
01:10:25 and understanding all that normal stuff
01:10:27 just comes as a part of like following the,
01:10:30 like the quote unquote natural, quote unquote normal,
01:10:34 like life progression as I saw it.
01:10:36 I thought that if I just like followed the standard model,
01:10:40 you know, high school, four years of college,
01:10:42 you know, get a job or go into graduate school
01:10:44 because I intended to go to graduate school
01:10:46 and get my PhD when I was in college.
01:10:48 That's what I wanted to do.
01:10:50 But yeah, no, they don't really tell you that stuff.
01:10:53 Let me tell you a little bit about my like,
01:10:56 my emotional relationship with education.
01:10:59 Like when I started college
01:11:01 and through most of my college life,
01:11:03 I honestly saw the institution of education and learning
01:11:07 with an almost like religious reverence.
01:11:09 Interesting.
01:11:10 I thought that it was like,
01:11:12 that like a college was a place where people go to learn
01:11:14 and learning was like sacred.
01:11:16 Like I was into it.
01:11:18 I was like, this is a beautiful magical thing.
01:11:21 And then like I graduated college
01:11:23 and I got a job, you know,
01:11:25 my first real job was working as a teacher at Astro Camp
01:11:29 and it was like just a bunch of fucking kids
01:11:32 walking around asking me dumb questions
01:11:34 and I had a little lesson thing I had to go through
01:11:36 and like, oh, here I'll show you this dumb demonstration
01:11:39 where I fill up a balloon with hydrogen
01:11:41 and blow it up in a big old fireball.
01:11:43 Here we go.
01:11:44 Yeah, whatever, it was bullshit.
01:11:46 And then I went and I fucking,
01:11:49 now I'm a physics tutor and I went
01:11:51 and I was taught in Poland for a while,
01:11:53 taught college level physics classes
01:11:55 and it was like the same thing.
01:11:57 It was the same as teaching kids this dumb crap.
01:11:59 I was just some idiot up at the board.
01:12:01 I had a lesson, I would go through it.
01:12:03 Like kids would sometimes pause the lesson
01:12:05 and ask me a question and I'd be,
01:12:07 you know, sometimes I could answer the question
01:12:09 but I like, I can't stop the lesson
01:12:11 just because one kid doesn't understand.
01:12:13 So I could just, I could try to explain a little bit,
01:12:15 but mostly I just like what you said before,
01:12:17 did you like just talking at someone
01:12:19 until they're so confused that they buy the car anyway?
01:12:21 I would just have to kind of think of some like
01:12:23 quick way to respond to the question
01:12:25 that was truthful and honest,
01:12:27 but like just get them to like think that they understood
01:12:30 in the hopes that I could then continue the lesson
01:12:32 and they would hopefully go and look at it
01:12:34 on their notes later.
01:12:36 Education just is way too generalized.
01:12:38 The thing is, I honestly felt like,
01:12:40 I felt weirdly embarrassed
01:12:42 about teaching this class because I knew,
01:12:44 like this was all stuff I learned in college
01:12:46 and it was in the textbook.
01:12:48 I was always thinking to myself,
01:12:50 why are these kids even showing up to my classes
01:12:52 and being taught in a classroom setting by me?
01:12:54 Why don't they just go home and read the textbook?
01:12:56 It's all in the textbook.
01:12:58 I do not have any special knowledge
01:13:00 that I'm sharing with them.
01:13:02 I don't even know why I'm here
01:13:04 and yet I was just expected to.
01:13:06 You say all the right things, Ben.
01:13:08 So now I've been totally,
01:13:10 I've been very much disillusioned with the idea
01:13:12 of that like college,
01:13:14 like classroom setting learning,
01:13:16 like now I kind of don't even understand it anymore
01:13:18 after having done it.
01:13:20 After having been on the other side of the equation.
01:13:22 That part where you said
01:13:24 like you can't pause the whole lesson
01:13:26 and understand like that brings us to the whole subject
01:13:28 of tests and stuff like, okay,
01:13:30 let's just deconstruct the whole education system.
01:13:32 Let's say it doesn't exist. Let's say it's 2,000 years ago
01:13:34 we need to invent school and like,
01:13:36 let's just imagine we're in the board of directors
01:13:38 where they invent school and they're like,
01:13:40 but wait a second, what if kids are just sitting
01:13:42 in the class and never paying attention?
01:13:44 How can we determine that they're paying attention?
01:13:46 Well, we'll have these pieces of paper
01:13:48 where they have to write out their correct answers
01:13:50 and then however many they get right becomes a percentage
01:13:52 and then we evaluate them based on the percentage
01:13:54 like, okay, that's obviously how that got invented.
01:13:56 But think about just how inefficient that is
01:13:58 because all you have to,
01:14:00 all you can worry about at school
01:14:02 is how can I
01:14:04 know just the right amount
01:14:06 of information in just the right ways
01:14:08 to get that percentage.
01:14:10 And that's like the number one thing everyone is worried about
01:14:12 at all times and it's the most inefficient way
01:14:14 to learn things and let me just say this,
01:14:16 this is for me the number one thing to say.
01:14:18 If the internet existed
01:14:20 on the day they came together
01:14:22 to invent school,
01:14:24 they wouldn't have invented school.
01:14:26 If the internet existed, there would have been no point.
01:14:28 School was invented back when most people
01:14:30 couldn't even write books.
01:14:32 It's an antiquated system.
01:14:34 Back when these books were almost impossible to come by.
01:14:36 You don't need it now.
01:14:38 It's based on a totally antiquated mindset
01:14:40 from a time before, yeah, you're right.
01:14:42 Oh, this gets to the number one.
01:14:44 Okay, this is the other thing I've got to talk about.
01:14:46 Nolan Bushnell, creator of Atari, father of video games.
01:14:48 In an interview one time
01:14:50 he was talking about his history with Atari
01:14:52 and the things that he accomplished
01:14:54 and the things he was disappointed about.
01:14:56 And he said the number one thing
01:14:58 that he was disappointed about
01:15:00 that didn't come together the way that he wanted to.
01:15:02 This is a guy who failed a lot.
01:15:04 This is a guy who fell from glory in the 80s.
01:15:06 But the number one thing that didn't go the way
01:15:08 he wanted to was educational games.
01:15:10 There's educational games,
01:15:12 but they're all boring, most of them,
01:15:14 except Oregon Trail and a couple other classics.
01:15:16 Using gaming
01:15:18 and computer programs as a form of education
01:15:20 never took off in the way that he wanted to.
01:15:22 Obviously, you know, video games
01:15:24 took off like wildfire.
01:15:26 Well, I don't know about that. I played Oregon Trail.
01:15:28 I think educational games are as good
01:15:30 as they need to be.
01:15:32 Well, the fact that they didn't just overwhelm
01:15:34 the way that we do education is a pretty big failure.
01:15:36 I think he was probably hoping the world would be transformed
01:15:38 into smart people or something by video games.
01:15:40 Here's the thing. I'm about to get very libertarian here.
01:15:42 He said that the reason why it wasn't allowed
01:15:44 to happen was because
01:15:46 of teachers' unions who don't want to be replaced
01:15:48 by computers.
01:15:50 And the way in teaching is so...
01:15:52 Oh, fuck.
01:15:54 That is making me write the fuck off.
01:15:56 Did I mention that B having been
01:15:58 a teacher gave me a lot less respect
01:16:00 for teachers?
01:16:02 I know it's an unpopular opinion.
01:16:04 You're supposed to pedestalize teachers and say that,
01:16:06 oh, they have the most important job.
01:16:08 I mean, there are some good teachers
01:16:10 who are really passionate and go above and beyond,
01:16:12 but I think in general I do not consider
01:16:14 teaching to be a noble profession
01:16:16 in and of itself.
01:16:18 So here's the thing. Education is such an institutionalized
01:16:20 thing, at least in America.
01:16:22 It's one of those...
01:16:24 I think now that all the other unions are going
01:16:26 by the wayside, the teachers' union is one of the strongest.
01:16:28 You can't get anything done.
01:16:30 They're so set in their ways
01:16:32 and so many of them are so old with these
01:16:34 30-year pensions.
01:16:36 Innovation is ridiculously hard.
01:16:38 And Nolan Bushnell was saying
01:16:40 first-hand that...
01:16:42 Dude, we're going to get an iPad in every class.
01:16:44 Every desk.
01:16:46 It's happening, but the fact that we didn't get an iPad
01:16:48 in every class, like one month after
01:16:50 the iPad came out, means that
01:16:52 there's this one very
01:16:54 creepy libertarian podcast called
01:16:56 Freakonomics that I listened to a couple episodes of
01:16:58 and they made a great point, which was
01:17:00 if you were to travel from the year 1890 to today,
01:17:02 almost everything would be different.
01:17:04 Everything works differently, but
01:17:06 except schools. They still basically look
01:17:08 the same way they did 130 years ago.
01:17:10 Hey, you know they got the same fucking buildings
01:17:12 a lot of the time.
01:17:14 A lot of them were the same people still teaching.
01:17:16 Yeah.
01:17:18 Dude, I got a...
01:17:20 Here's an anecdote. From the 70s, they built schools
01:17:22 without windows, because apparently that would allow you
01:17:24 to focus better. But then I guess a couple of
01:17:26 children just got a little bit crazy
01:17:28 from that and they stopped that whole trend.
01:17:30 Someone in Japan built a window
01:17:32 on the side of a classroom and some anime character
01:17:34 sat next to it and everything
01:17:36 was different from then on.
01:17:38 That's right. Alright. Well, I want to get into
01:17:40 since Ben went into his
01:17:42 emotional relationship with schooling, I have to
01:17:44 do mine too. Because I want to paint
01:17:46 this picture of why I feel so
01:17:48 negatively about the school system.
01:17:50 Because I think
01:17:52 I have uniquely been
01:17:54 failed and am surrounded by people
01:17:56 who have been failed by
01:17:58 school.
01:18:00 Oh man, yeah.
01:18:02 Starting with myself. See,
01:18:04 my mom raised me to
01:18:06 be extremely
01:18:08 grade oriented.
01:18:10 She was very
01:18:12 disappointed if I made a C
01:18:14 and she would reward me highly if I made
01:18:16 A's and B's.
01:18:18 I had this mindset of anything below a C
01:18:20 is a titanic failure.
01:18:22 We kind of did too.
01:18:24 When I was in 8th grade, I think
01:18:26 I got my first D
01:18:28 or F on one report card.
01:18:30 Didn't even fail the class, but I
01:18:32 carried it like a
01:18:34 fucking noose around my neck that I had
01:18:36 gotten at that grade.
01:18:38 The same thing happened to me in 5th grade.
01:18:40 I got like a 50 on a test for some
01:18:42 reason and I was distraught. I banged
01:18:44 my head on the blackboard in class
01:18:46 and like just, yeah.
01:18:48 I was fucked up.
01:18:50 I had this experience where when I was in elementary
01:18:52 school, for the first few years
01:18:54 everyone, like my mom
01:18:56 and my dad and my teachers were all convinced I
01:18:58 was a genius.
01:19:00 If only they could have known
01:19:02 how wrong they were.
01:19:04 I would do really well in every subject.
01:19:06 I was really great at schooling.
01:19:08 In the 2nd grade, they put me in
01:19:10 a gifted program they had at the school
01:19:12 where it's just like they did a little
01:19:14 extra mile stuff.
01:19:16 Then they had a whole gifted school
01:19:18 like the advanced learning school and they
01:19:20 were like, alright, when I went into 3rd grade
01:19:22 they put me there.
01:19:24 What very quickly became apparent
01:19:26 was I was not good enough for the school
01:19:28 because the school is for people who are
01:19:30 I think honestly I could
01:19:32 partially maybe blame my mom
01:19:34 for just not understanding the way
01:19:36 that studying works because she would
01:19:38 just tell me to sit at the table and not
01:19:40 stop working until I was
01:19:42 done and I would never do it.
01:19:44 I would just sit there and stare at my work
01:19:46 and like not, you know.
01:19:48 Same. I was a big procrastinator.
01:19:50 Even back then I was a procrastinator.
01:19:52 Me too. I was all about putting off my work.
01:19:54 I never wanted to get my homework done.
01:19:56 I would just wait and wait and say fuck.
01:19:58 I was in 3rd and 4th grade at this gifted
01:20:00 school. I was not doing as well
01:20:02 and particularly in 4th grade and my teacher
01:20:04 was a huge bitch, right?
01:20:06 Here's the thing. I ended up
01:20:08 halfway through 4th grade I dropped back
01:20:10 down to regular school and at this point
01:20:12 I had been
01:20:14 bullied a lot as well
01:20:16 at both that school and when I went back
01:20:18 to the normal one. They'd push you down
01:20:20 and say, enemies of Japanese colloquialism.
01:20:22 No.
01:20:24 They'd take my glasses
01:20:26 for, you know, just fuck with me
01:20:28 and just call me a girl because I look like a girl.
01:20:30 But they, you know,
01:20:32 I dropped out of that
01:20:34 advanced school and apparently
01:20:36 I found out later that that teacher
01:20:38 something like
01:20:40 6 kids dropped from her
01:20:42 class and they fired her.
01:20:44 Because they realized that she was so
01:20:46 because she was fucking terrible. All she would do
01:20:48 like if someone, I remember
01:20:50 several times because there was a kid who dropped
01:20:52 out of the class before me because
01:20:54 every time he didn't do it, like he would come in
01:20:56 with no homework or something, the teacher would
01:20:58 like berate him for 10 minutes
01:21:00 and he'd be like crying and shit.
01:21:02 That's a good use of class time.
01:21:04 Yeah, just like berating this kid and she would give us
01:21:06 these like assignments that were like
01:21:08 these insane logic puzzles
01:21:10 that involved researching shit on the internet
01:21:12 that we hadn't even learned how to do
01:21:14 that, you know, and like.
01:21:16 Dude, quick insertion story
01:21:18 like so she eventually got fired.
01:21:20 That is so wonderful to hear because
01:21:22 my mom tells me these horror stories
01:21:24 about this woman she works with who's like a teacher
01:21:26 she's like my mom's the head of the class
01:21:28 this is like a second level lady but
01:21:30 this woman is a horrible teacher
01:21:32 and no one wants to work with her
01:21:34 but instead of fucking firing her
01:21:36 they just transfer her from classroom
01:21:38 to classroom because no one wants to deal with her
01:21:40 oh is that how we want to handle things
01:21:42 we've got people that are so bad we just keep moving
01:21:44 them around instead of just getting rid of them
01:21:46 I don't understand how people can be bad at their
01:21:48 jobs and not be fired
01:21:50 it's like a thing that happens
01:21:52 it's a union thing or something I guess
01:21:54 I don't know
01:21:56 well one of it is you don't know
01:21:58 well hold on I have some experience with
01:22:00 hiring people because I see my dad doing it
01:22:02 a lot of it is you don't know if you're going to
01:22:04 be able to replace them with someone who isn't worse
01:22:06 that's I think the number one reason why bad people don't use their jobs
01:22:08 this woman it would be better to have no one
01:22:10 than to have this particular person
01:22:12 well I don't know like you have to fill the
01:22:14 you have to get the kids sitting down for
01:22:16 a correct amount of time
01:22:18 further distribute like the time of each
01:22:20 individual teacher if one person goes
01:22:22 they'll find some anyway go on
01:22:24 so anyways to continue my story
01:22:26 after that experience I kind of became
01:22:28 disillusioned with the idea that I was
01:22:30 good at school
01:22:32 I come up with this idea that I was this genius
01:22:34 and then I had to drop out of the
01:22:36 fancy school
01:22:38 and I just wasn't I never did as
01:22:40 well as I did when I was a little kid
01:22:42 man that didn't happen to me until college but I wish
01:22:44 it happened a lot sooner
01:22:46 well and my parents I just felt like I was a genius
01:22:48 and then I spent like the rest of
01:22:50 like regular schooling not believing that
01:22:52 and I had to get on to YouTube to
01:22:54 reaffirm my assumptions about myself
01:22:56 I kind of had a similar thing like I
01:22:58 you know was in gifted classes and stuff
01:23:00 and like I really I really saw myself as a smart
01:23:02 kid and it was a strong
01:23:04 part of my self image that I was an intelligent
01:23:06 person and along with and that gave me
01:23:08 this this like this like religious
01:23:10 all over learning and institutionalized learning
01:23:12 and that self image of being a smart
01:23:14 person I think was a huge factor
01:23:16 in me being motivated enough to
01:23:18 do my classwork and like actually yeah
01:23:20 that's where we're getting those two things fed
01:23:22 into each other because we got to get to this
01:23:24 because this is how it all goes down this is where
01:23:26 the big event happens right so like I
01:23:28 sort of disillusioned with the idea that
01:23:30 I'm super smart but I always wanted to
01:23:32 recapture it you know so like
01:23:34 in ninth and tenth grade I didn't
01:23:36 do all that well I was kind of going
01:23:38 downhill a little bit but I was going into
01:23:40 eleventh grade and I was like you know what
01:23:42 I'm gonna pick up like I'm you know college
01:23:44 is gonna come pretty soon and
01:23:46 at this point I've been like horribly depressed
01:23:48 like because my whole teen years were
01:23:50 spent like depressed as shit and so I was
01:23:52 just like really desperate for a way to like pick
01:23:54 myself up and get get into
01:23:56 the action right so yeah good
01:23:58 so I was like I wanted
01:24:00 to there's my school
01:24:02 had this program where
01:24:04 basically the community colleges near
01:24:06 here called TCC they have a certain
01:24:08 building called the ATC building
01:24:10 where they teach like
01:24:12 college courses to high school kids
01:24:14 essentially so right you know if you're
01:24:16 one of those smarter fast-track kids and
01:24:18 you want to learn like special skills
01:24:20 usually involving computers and like
01:24:22 you know any kind of computer
01:24:24 related shit they would bust all
01:24:26 these kids out to this other school
01:24:28 across town and
01:24:30 then bust them back at the end of the day
01:24:32 they would go there like every other day
01:24:34 so I wanted to do ATC
01:24:36 so I could learn like some
01:24:38 I think it was just programming or something
01:24:40 like wanted to be a video game guy or something
01:24:42 like that I just wanted to learn some computer skills
01:24:44 yeah so I signed up for
01:24:46 ATC and then I also signed up for
01:24:48 an advanced English class because
01:24:50 I was particularly good at writing
01:24:52 I always have been so I
01:24:54 wanted to you know take an advanced
01:24:56 course in it so
01:24:58 I settled like that's the those are
01:25:00 what that's the thing I applied for
01:25:02 like I set everything in motion here's the
01:25:04 thing no one
01:25:06 at any point contacted me
01:25:08 to tell me that
01:25:10 I couldn't do this
01:25:12 schedule because
01:25:14 the amount of classes
01:25:16 basically there was like a contradiction in the classes
01:25:18 I was taking where I had
01:25:20 like I would have had an overlap or something
01:25:22 like I had too many like I had
01:25:24 one class and
01:25:26 to take
01:25:28 the ATC thing
01:25:30 and so I approached
01:25:32 like I know here's what it was
01:25:34 it was that when I had first signed up
01:25:36 for all those classes my I told this to
01:25:38 my guidance counselor before
01:25:40 like the 10th grade
01:25:42 had ended and she had said well
01:25:44 if you take this course load then you'll have to take
01:25:46 algebra 2 over the summer
01:25:48 as a summer school class
01:25:50 and I said okay that sounds great right
01:25:52 uh-huh
01:25:54 summer rolls by
01:25:56 you know and she meant like the next summer
01:25:58 I would take it as a class I go to school on the
01:26:00 first day and no one's contacted me
01:26:02 at all about how to go to ATC
01:26:04 I don't know what bus I'm taking
01:26:06 I don't know where it is
01:26:08 because I didn't know much about it I'd never done it before
01:26:10 so no one's told me like how to get there
01:26:12 so I go to the guidance
01:26:14 office because I'm just like fucking lost and confused
01:26:16 and I go to her and I'm like so
01:26:18 am I doing this ATC thing like am I
01:26:20 going there and she was like well
01:26:22 you can't do
01:26:24 all these classes because they
01:26:26 there's like a whole and I said well I thought
01:26:28 you said I could do algebra 2 over the summer and she was like
01:26:30 uhhhh
01:26:32 no that kind of thing
01:26:34 so basically on the first
01:26:36 day of school she asks me
01:26:38 like you know on the spot
01:26:40 like you have to either
01:26:42 drop out of ATC or drop out of
01:26:44 advanced English and I was just like
01:26:46 well I guess I'm not doing ATC
01:26:48 so I didn't do it so
01:26:50 that was just stricken from my thing right
01:26:52 so at this point like I'm majorly
01:26:54 deflated because I have this
01:26:56 go get her attitude towards 11th grade
01:26:58 and already half of what I wanted
01:27:00 to do was gone
01:27:02 so I start taking the advanced English class
01:27:04 and at this point I get extremely depressed
01:27:06 and I hated this class my teacher
01:27:08 was like really trying to push
01:27:10 this like feminist agenda and stuff
01:27:12 and was super into like
01:27:14 she was like one of those super
01:27:16 um like reading
01:27:18 all this meaning into the text
01:27:20 but then you had to like
01:27:22 like she would teach you that like oh
01:27:24 you can learn you had to read the same meaning
01:27:26 exactly like that is by far
01:27:28 the most pissed off I've ever
01:27:30 been at any curriculum I've ever taken
01:27:32 like what is this character feeling
01:27:34 as she gets out of the car and sneezes on the inside
01:27:36 of her breast pocket depression
01:27:38 disdain disorder
01:27:40 distrust I uh
01:27:42 why do I know what you're gonna interpret it as
01:27:44 who want this
01:27:46 why is that a thing in school
01:27:48 that makes no sense
01:27:50 why is that a thing you can get graded on
01:27:52 that's a good question
01:27:54 you just wanted to scream
01:27:56 I think so too
01:27:58 I couldn't believe the world
01:28:00 when I heard that
01:28:02 like why can we ever
01:28:04 critique Soviet Russia
01:28:06 or the Nazis or the ancient
01:28:08 Incans or anyone else
01:28:10 with their terrible practices
01:28:12 and their terrible ideologies
01:28:14 when our society
01:28:16 can't look down on them when we have
01:28:18 stuff like that that you're supposed to go over
01:28:20 but at least we didn't burn all the Jews
01:28:22 you know we've got that going on
01:28:24 to finish this story
01:28:26 but the Nazis had a very
01:28:28 relativistic view of how the Jews
01:28:30 were feeling
01:28:32 someone came to my house and said
01:28:34 go to his gas
01:28:36 you either have to go to this gas chamber
01:28:38 or
01:28:40 answer all these bull crap questions
01:28:42 about this book
01:28:44 it would be a hard decision
01:28:46 so anyways
01:28:48 I had this advanced English class
01:28:50 I hated it it was way too much work
01:28:52 like ten times more than all the other
01:28:54 classes combined basically
01:28:56 just shit tons of work
01:28:58 and the teacher was a bitch
01:29:00 and I hated her and so
01:29:02 she would assign us like these
01:29:04 writing assignments based on whatever books we were reading
01:29:06 and we were like chomping through books in this class
01:29:08 like every other class would get assigned
01:29:10 like one book a year this was like
01:29:12 reading all the time writing all these essays
01:29:14 like all this really deep
01:29:16 high-minded stuff and this is the kind of shit
01:29:18 there was a lot of kids in this class because we only had
01:29:20 like one advanced placement English class
01:29:22 but like most of them weren't going to make it
01:29:24 it was like you had to be like a straight
01:29:26 A student to be a part of the advanced placement classes
01:29:28 at this school
01:29:30 so
01:29:32 at this point I've become extremely depressed
01:29:34 I don't care about anything
01:29:36 I'm bombing this class pretty hard
01:29:38 and I start writing the most like
01:29:40 fucked up essays possible
01:29:42 right so at one point the teacher
01:29:44 asks us to like
01:29:46 take five quotes and like
01:29:48 write an analysis of them
01:29:50 so I choose
01:29:52 and I don't know
01:29:54 oh it's much better than that
01:29:56 one of my five
01:29:58 was the speech that Martin Luther King
01:30:00 gives in the boondocks
01:30:02 where he gives the whole
01:30:04 all I see is fucking niggas
01:30:06 would you ignorant niggas
01:30:08 please shut the hell up
01:30:10 shut the hell up
01:30:12 I wrote out the whole speech
01:30:14 in my essay with all the niggas
01:30:16 intact
01:30:18 I hope you just said
01:30:20 an asterisk
01:30:22 every single one
01:30:24 the whole essay is just asterisk
01:30:26 it wasn't very long
01:30:28 we only had to write one page of analysis of each quote
01:30:30 but I did that quote
01:30:32 which the teacher
01:30:34 not only gave me
01:30:36 a shit grade for that
01:30:38 but also wrote into the notes like
01:30:40 Martin Luther King never said this
01:30:42 which is you bitch
01:30:44 because I said in the essay
01:30:46 that it was a quote from a show
01:30:48 so she didn't even read
01:30:50 your fucking essay
01:30:52 the epitome of fucking commenting
01:30:54 before reading the entire video
01:30:56 she was the first
01:30:58 she was the first shitty commenter
01:31:00 you ever had
01:31:02 imagine in the board of directors
01:31:04 when they're inventing education and someone says
01:31:06 you have to have a test with grades
01:31:08 someone would have been like wait hold on
01:31:10 all the essays that they have to write
01:31:12 that's subjective how can you grade that
01:31:14 just get out
01:31:16 we just gotta get this system over with
01:31:18 we gotta get back to not dying
01:31:20 I had it in my head because like one of the books we read
01:31:22 early into this class
01:31:24 had the word cunt
01:31:26 and the word fuck in it
01:31:28 so I kinda got it in my head like okay
01:31:30 we're reading stuff with swears in it
01:31:32 I can write those into my essays
01:31:34 it's advanced
01:31:36 we're all mature adults here
01:31:38 I wrote some swearing
01:31:40 I got into a lot of trouble
01:31:42 the word niggas
01:31:44 is like water and the school system
01:31:46 is like the wicked witch of the west
01:31:48 when you put one on the other
01:31:50 the whole thing just collapses
01:31:52 here's how I almost got expelled from school
01:31:54 so I wrote an essay
01:31:56 oh by the way your story is very American
01:31:58 history X
01:32:00 so this essay
01:32:02 that I wrote was
01:32:04 our teacher assigned us that we had to take
01:32:06 one
01:32:08 author
01:32:10 who we had read in class
01:32:12 and apply their style to a story
01:32:14 about a time when we had failed
01:32:16 and so I chose George Orwell
01:32:18 and to apply it
01:32:20 to me failing
01:32:22 to do my English homework
01:32:24 and I wrote this five page essay
01:32:26 that was like this
01:32:28 unbelievably depressing manifesto
01:32:30 about how much I
01:32:32 hated doing schoolwork
01:32:34 it's like bouncing between
01:32:36 it was
01:32:38 I assume it was pretty good
01:32:40 at this point I had gotten a handle
01:32:42 on writing in this Gonzo style
01:32:44 that I kind of do now
01:32:46 so it read kind of like an S4 Diary video
01:32:48 but it was bouncing between dialogue
01:32:50 between me and Donsan
01:32:52 and storytelling or narrating
01:32:54 and so there's one part where I'm talking about
01:32:56 how I'm
01:32:58 holding a gun to my head
01:33:00 and convincing myself not to pull the trigger
01:33:02 to the deck down
01:33:04 there's one part where I'm in the text
01:33:06 because I was texting Donsan in part of the story
01:33:08 and he says something like don't flip out
01:33:10 and stab your teacher or something like that
01:33:12 oh boy here we go
01:33:14 just like how when you did those update videos
01:33:16 with you with a gun they took that seriously
01:33:18 and thought you were trying to kill yourself
01:33:20 so your teachers really were shooting commentary
01:33:22 is that the one where you shoot yourself in the head like eight times
01:33:24 and it doesn't do anything
01:33:26 that's the sort of online announcement
01:33:28 so I wrote this essay
01:33:30 I turned it in and like
01:33:32 like she was like always
01:33:34 grading this stuff like a month after we turned it in
01:33:36 like she was it was like a really long cycle
01:33:38 so it was a long time before I heard back about this
01:33:40 but I happened to be like
01:33:42 out of the house
01:33:44 and I come walking home and my parents are like
01:33:46 furious and terrified and like yelling at me
01:33:48 like what the fuck did you do what did you write
01:33:50 and I'm like confused as fuck because it's been a while
01:33:52 since I wrote this thing so I'd forgotten about it
01:33:54 and what the funny thing is
01:33:56 like the motivation for writing it was
01:33:58 I wanted to get out of this English class
01:34:00 like it was a cry for help
01:34:02 it was a cry for please get me out of here
01:34:04 so I get into all this trouble
01:34:06 and my dad's particularly freaking out
01:34:08 because this is like maybe
01:34:10 two months after the Virginia Tech Massacre
01:34:12 so like
01:34:14 the idea that they called my parents
01:34:16 and are like your son wrote this essay
01:34:18 where he mentioned stabbing teachers and shooting people
01:34:20 and they're like that's how it was
01:34:22 put to my parents
01:34:24 because what had happened was
01:34:26 this essay and she got scared
01:34:28 and she came to my guidance counselor
01:34:30 who as we've already established is an
01:34:32 idiot and a bitch
01:34:34 and she read the essay and she interpreted it
01:34:36 way more dramatically
01:34:38 and she thought it was like this
01:34:40 you know this terrifying
01:34:42 manifesto kind of thing
01:34:44 so she's the one who called my parents and was like
01:34:46 your son's writing about shooting teachers and stuff
01:34:48 so I have to go in
01:34:50 the next day to a meeting
01:34:52 where it's like my assistant
01:34:54 was like a disciple for my grade
01:34:56 and the school psychologist did not know
01:34:58 that was a thing
01:35:00 but apparently there's a school psychologist
01:35:02 who they bring in for moments like this
01:35:04 and we sit in a meeting with them and my parents
01:35:06 luckily they were both
01:35:08 way more they were both cool
01:35:10 they were understanding
01:35:12 the psychologist liked the essay
01:35:14 he was like you know I think
01:35:16 he read it and he said I think you're gonna be a great writer someday
01:35:18 so they
01:35:20 they liked it and they were like alright
01:35:22 take the rest of the day off and come in tomorrow
01:35:24 and we'll discuss this right
01:35:26 so the next day at the very end of the day
01:35:28 like the bells ringing for everyone
01:35:30 to go home and they like take me into this
01:35:32 side meeting room that I didn't even know about
01:35:34 and there's like all these teachers
01:35:36 in there like the English teacher
01:35:38 the assistant principal, the school psychologist
01:35:40 and then like a bunch of people I don't even know
01:35:42 are all like having a round table with me right
01:35:44 and
01:35:46 I didn't quite like understand what was
01:35:48 happening at the time because I was a really shy
01:35:50 offspoken kid and I didn't handle
01:35:52 quick decision making well at all
01:35:54 right? If you do, if you do at that age
01:35:56 we're all on the spectrum
01:35:58 what I eventually figured out was they were
01:36:00 basically trying to get me
01:36:02 to say I don't want to take this class anymore
01:36:04 because
01:36:06 why did they just fucking say that?
01:36:08 they were saying like hey
01:36:10 are you sure you want to take this class
01:36:12 are you sure you don't want to stop because it seems like
01:36:14 from this essay you don't want to take this class
01:36:16 and I kind of got the sense that maybe the teacher
01:36:18 is just afraid to have me in that class anymore
01:36:20 yeah that's totally possible
01:36:22 so moral of the story
01:36:24 is eventually they talked me into dropping the class
01:36:26 she's a feminist and she fears the
01:36:28 of the manpower and dude it was so epic
01:36:30 when this happened because I come walking out of this
01:36:32 boardroom and like they had told my
01:36:34 bus to just like wait for me
01:36:36 so like I come out like
01:36:38 all the other buses have left and I come
01:36:40 walking out of the building and my bus is waiting
01:36:42 there like by itself with all the kids on it
01:36:44 and I just get out and I'm like
01:36:46 I got everything I wanted
01:36:48 like I became convinced I was God
01:36:50 after this because
01:36:52 I had finished to miss a day of
01:36:54 school and stay home
01:36:56 I got out of the English class I didn't want to be a part of
01:36:58 no repercussions, no punishments
01:37:00 we're looking at a
01:37:02 light yagami level intellect over here
01:37:04 it's fucking amazing what this guy can do
01:37:06 like you can find on my anime
01:37:08 blog where I wrote like a post that's like
01:37:10 to the effect of I'm a fucking God
01:37:12 I can't believe how great I am
01:37:14 God of the new world did you bro
01:37:16 um so I
01:37:18 it's a death note reference people
01:37:20 I got a shitty essay story
01:37:22 it's gonna be quicker than yours
01:37:24 I'll just wrap up my disillusion
01:37:26 because like after that
01:37:28 I ended up in a normal English class
01:37:30 which I literally passed while sleeping
01:37:32 through every class like it was on the level
01:37:34 of idiocy that I could do
01:37:36 I could not fail it like I couldn't
01:37:38 possibly fail the class
01:37:40 but from that point forward
01:37:42 like this is what school is
01:37:44 to me it's guidance counselors failing
01:37:46 you and getting getting your fucking
01:37:48 shit messed up it's teachers
01:37:50 who are fucking don't understand
01:37:52 you and don't have like I mean how could she possibly
01:37:54 have just like figured out
01:37:56 my problems when she had like four there were
01:37:58 literally 40 kids in this class like per class
01:38:00 and she was you know grading essays
01:38:02 a month after they were written how the
01:38:04 fuck is she supposed to deal with my hang ups
01:38:06 you know like she can
01:38:08 which is why they had to have school psychologists
01:38:10 do it so like in my
01:38:12 like I just became so
01:38:14 like in the mindset of like wow
01:38:16 school means nothing and like the 12th
01:38:18 grade at my school they were so
01:38:20 desperate to graduate kids that
01:38:22 12th grade was just a skate
01:38:24 like they would get like none of the classes would give
01:38:26 homework everyone was trying to like
01:38:28 baby the students
01:38:30 that's pretty common my English teacher
01:38:32 like he was supposed to assign
01:38:34 like 1984 as the
01:38:36 reading for that thing and he literally
01:38:38 didn't give us a book because he was like you guys aren't
01:38:40 going to read it and I don't want to fail all of you
01:38:42 so he didn't give us the book
01:38:44 so it was just such a walk in the park and I've
01:38:46 had like you know just to summarize
01:38:48 really quick like one of my friends Mike
01:38:50 he this dude
01:38:52 couldn't this dude had like
01:38:54 29 credits
01:38:56 but there was one class that he hadn't
01:38:58 passed and he was like
01:39:00 18 and you know full
01:39:02 fully graduated
01:39:04 except that he couldn't take this one class
01:39:06 and they wouldn't let him take it because he couldn't
01:39:08 take one class like they
01:39:10 you can't just come back to school and take one
01:39:12 class in high school why the fuck
01:39:14 not I don't know but he had already
01:39:16 done all the other classes
01:39:18 he had 29 credits the maximum you need
01:39:20 to graduate is 24
01:39:22 he had 29 and he couldn't graduate
01:39:24 they wouldn't let him go take the other class
01:39:26 I'm so far over
01:39:28 my graduation requirements for school in terms
01:39:30 of numbers it's just the fucking specific
01:39:32 piece of shit
01:39:34 in my senior year
01:39:36 of high school in English class
01:39:38 by the way English was my best subject in high
01:39:40 school definitely
01:39:42 so and I was in
01:39:44 like advanced English
01:39:46 and we had like a big
01:39:48 literary essay for the last
01:39:50 semester of fucking 12th grade or whatever
01:39:52 and or 11th it doesn't matter
01:39:54 and we had to
01:39:56 like we knew about it the entire semester it counted
01:39:58 for like a third of our grade it was big
01:40:00 and
01:40:02 you know it was very strict about like
01:40:04 notation like you have to
01:40:06 you have to make a bibliography
01:40:08 and notate it in the APA format
01:40:10 I remember doing that yep
01:40:12 you have to be very strict about that
01:40:14 anyway the day finally
01:40:16 comes when it's due I've been writing it for like weeks
01:40:18 and I've got
01:40:20 and I bring it to class and I realize
01:40:22 like I look at my bibliography and I see
01:40:24 you're supposed to have the
01:40:26 titles underlined and the other things
01:40:28 in quotations whatever anyway one of my things is not
01:40:30 underlined properly it's
01:40:32 underlined I tried
01:40:34 I drew in an underline but it looked bad because
01:40:36 I drew it on the pen and I was like shit
01:40:38 this doesn't look quite right
01:40:40 so I went to my friend
01:40:42 who was in who had like a computer lab
01:40:44 class and I was like hey
01:40:46 would you mind doing me a favor
01:40:48 could you just like reprint
01:40:50 this one little page
01:40:52 with the underline
01:40:54 in place yeah like print this
01:40:56 with an underline just so it's it's right
01:40:58 when you're in the fucking computer lab and she was like
01:41:00 share Ben I'll do this
01:41:02 for you so later
01:41:04 so later that day she hands me the
01:41:06 retight version it's in a totally different font
01:41:08 this time oh god
01:41:10 whatever at least at least it's complete
01:41:12 I hand it in I get
01:41:14 the essay back like a week later with a big
01:41:16 fucking zero on it
01:41:18 because I had because
01:41:20 because it was because she had forgotten
01:41:22 one of my sources
01:41:24 and because it was missing a source
01:41:26 they gave me a zero for plagiarism
01:41:28 of course
01:41:30 oh my god
01:41:32 I lost like an entire letter and my
01:41:34 parents were furious they went to school
01:41:36 and were like this is totally unfair
01:41:38 this is a stupid that you would give a
01:41:40 zero for this like typo
01:41:42 is basically what it is but they were so
01:41:44 fucking set on like they had
01:41:46 like oh no we laid out the rules really
01:41:48 clearly like we're really set on sticking
01:41:50 to these fucking guidelines we've laid out
01:41:52 so yeah I got a big zero
01:41:54 like the biggest essay of the entire
01:41:56 schooling
01:41:58 every time I hear something like that I just want to
01:42:00 go burn down a school
01:42:02 yeah absolutely
01:42:04 here's a different kind of story on that
01:42:06 by the way I've only got 14 minutes left
01:42:08 of disk space let's wrap this shit up
01:42:10 listen to this I don't know why
01:42:12 because I'm an idiot
01:42:14 but listen to this
01:42:16 my buddy John in college
01:42:18 was taking astronomy
01:42:20 yes astronomy
01:42:22 one of the assignments they had to do
01:42:24 he just did not give a fuck
01:42:26 he had calculated that like it's such an easy class
01:42:28 that like he had already gotten an A
01:42:30 no matter what he did at this point
01:42:32 the worst he could get was a B
01:42:34 no matter if he got a zero for everything else
01:42:36 so what he did for the final assignment
01:42:38 was just like this big like summary of like
01:42:40 it was kind of like just your thoughts and opinions
01:42:42 on like what astronomy
01:42:44 is about like what it's meant to you and stuff
01:42:46 so what he did instead of actually writing
01:42:48 this essay properly
01:42:50 he wrote it a stream of consciousness
01:42:52 like about his current feelings
01:42:54 about astronomy
01:42:56 while just like thinking about the night sky
01:42:58 and so it's just this whole big thing
01:43:00 is that what it was supposed to be about
01:43:02 no well I mean not really
01:43:04 it was supposed to have like sources
01:43:06 and like we learned this this and this and like
01:43:08 but he just interpreted it
01:43:10 something like your what you've learned
01:43:12 in the class but it's supposed to be like a fairly big
01:43:14 like five page paper about you know
01:43:16 substantive stuff
01:43:18 but he just talked about like Mars
01:43:20 Mars is red red makes me feel
01:43:22 angry I look up at the sky and I see Mars
01:43:24 I get I get so angry
01:43:26 but then I look at Venus and I see Venus
01:43:28 and I'm filled with hope and I'm filled with lust
01:43:30 for a woman's body you know like
01:43:32 this is what he wrote in the paper and like
01:43:34 so he gets it back like a month later
01:43:36 after he turns it in it just says
01:43:38 on the paper F
01:43:40 terrible and that's it
01:43:42 and that's it
01:43:44 that's kind of when to go John
01:43:46 all of my essays in high school were always
01:43:48 like stream of conscious meditatives
01:43:50 like they all were terrible
01:43:52 just the one word
01:43:54 and did he just did he just shrug and go like
01:43:56 yeah yes so
01:43:58 yeah that's exactly how he implied it
01:44:00 to me
01:44:02 another thing that happened like when I was
01:44:04 in 12th grade we had
01:44:06 like a government class I think it was
01:44:08 and like
01:44:10 these
01:44:12 we had this new teacher who like
01:44:14 she had just come from like another school and she
01:44:16 transferred in and like
01:44:18 half the time in class
01:44:20 she would just like not be able to
01:44:22 explain the subject matter to the students
01:44:24 in a way that they could understand
01:44:26 because she was like super by the book
01:44:28 but she always seemed like really nervous and stuff
01:44:30 like and so I would often
01:44:32 like there was one time she was trying to explain
01:44:34 affirmative action and
01:44:36 oh boy oh boy here comes the white
01:44:38 trying to do this like yeah she
01:44:40 wouldn't like use like
01:44:42 words white or black and stuff
01:44:44 really trying to like tiptoe
01:44:46 around the issue
01:44:48 she was white I assume she was
01:44:50 was white okay about half the class
01:44:52 was black so yeah
01:44:54 like I could tell
01:44:56 everyone in the class seemed interested
01:44:58 and like they wanted to understand
01:45:00 but she just could not explain it because she
01:45:02 was walking so hard on eggshells
01:45:04 and finally I did this
01:45:06 like a lot of times during this class
01:45:08 I would just say yo niggas let me tell you
01:45:10 I literally said to the teacher
01:45:12 can I explain this
01:45:14 and she was like did you stood up with his arms
01:45:16 crossed with his backwards hat and his big
01:45:18 and his big and his big flavorflave
01:45:20 chain and said yo let me break it down
01:45:22 for you I would say can I explain this
01:45:24 and she'd say yes and I was just like
01:45:26 if you have
01:45:28 10 white guys and 5 black guys
01:45:30 in the community that's how many you have to hire
01:45:32 you're like it's that simple
01:45:34 you know and everyone got it
01:45:36 you know and but it's just
01:45:38 that like she was so by the
01:45:40 book about everything and it's funny too because
01:45:42 I didn't do well in this class because I would goof
01:45:44 off the whole time like me and that kid
01:45:46 Mike I mentioned sat next to each other
01:45:48 and we were just fucking talk and pass
01:45:50 notes and be assholes and so like
01:45:52 even though I knew the subject
01:45:54 well enough that I was
01:45:56 teaching parts of the class better
01:45:58 than the teacher could I nonetheless
01:46:00 because she was very
01:46:02 strictly by the book and I was completely
01:46:04 not following the book
01:46:06 didn't do well in this class but I just
01:46:08 to me all of this just says like all I see
01:46:10 is a joke when I look at the school system
01:46:12 all I see is all these cracks
01:46:14 like people fall through the cracks and there's cracks
01:46:16 everywhere it's all cracks
01:46:18 it's just a joke
01:46:20 you say it's a joke I say it's a big
01:46:22 old fucking circus that's how I feel about it
01:46:24 like when I'm
01:46:26 tutoring someone I'm just like
01:46:28 this is a joke like you don't need me
01:46:30 you don't need me to tell you this stuff
01:46:32 you could look it up on your own but you just don't
01:46:34 for some thank you because I'm being paid for
01:46:36 this I appreciate it but why
01:46:38 why are you going on and on and on and on
01:46:40 about all these problems what are some solutions
01:46:42 everyone here's my
01:46:44 here's my solution
01:46:46 we will start
01:46:48 the TPC institution it'll be the easiest
01:46:50 school ever right you go
01:46:52 you go to your decent human behavior
01:46:54 class and it's just Jesse being
01:46:56 don't stop being a fucking faggot
01:46:58 you go to your economics class
01:47:00 you go to your economics class and it's just
01:47:02 all standing there in a circle going get money
01:47:04 get money
01:47:06 get money get money
01:47:08 and you're in a school in like 45 minutes
01:47:10 and you've learned everything you need to know
01:47:12 that's the best fucking thing I've ever heard to do
01:47:14 other than that my solution would be
01:47:16 I think
01:47:18 I think we take elementary
01:47:20 and middle school maybe add one more year
01:47:22 under middle school and
01:47:24 turn it into teaching
01:47:26 way more life skills way less bullshit
01:47:28 I can't tell you how many times
01:47:30 I relearned US history throughout school
01:47:32 I don't care none of it mattered
01:47:34 like I learned the same
01:47:36 10 names about American history
01:47:38 in every single year of education
01:47:40 cut that shit out learn it once
01:47:42 and then it's over because if I ever need the knowledge
01:47:44 I'll look it up on the fucking computer
01:47:46 so cut out
01:47:48 majority of history can be cut out
01:47:50 and you don't even learn the good stuff for example
01:47:52 there was a civil war general named Hooker
01:47:54 where that name came from because he had all these women in his tent
01:47:56 never learned that in school
01:47:58 so yeah cut out most of the history shit
01:48:00 if you have a kid
01:48:02 who's not doing good
01:48:04 at math and you really try
01:48:06 but it seems like he's not making it
01:48:08 put him in something else
01:48:10 take him out and by the way also in the civil war
01:48:12 general Burnside had the largest
01:48:14 sideburns of all time and that's where the term sideburns come from
01:48:16 so you see the civil war has a huge
01:48:18 wealth of knowledge
01:48:20 with all of the money
01:48:22 that we've saved by cutting
01:48:24 three entire years off of the education system
01:48:26 and
01:48:28 and just burning down lots of schools
01:48:30 because
01:48:32 like
01:48:34 now that we've saved all this money
01:48:36 let's put it into
01:48:38 making way more trade
01:48:40 schools and way more schools where
01:48:42 after the
01:48:44 ninth grade, ninth grade is the last grade we have
01:48:46 in my new school system
01:48:48 you have nine grades, they're way more specialized
01:48:50 we put in
01:48:52 there's lots of different types of courses
01:48:54 it seems like he doesn't know anything about math
01:48:56 put him in an arts course
01:48:58 if he doesn't know anything about arts
01:49:00 put him in a math course, find somewhere
01:49:02 have different course loads for different people
01:49:04 way more so than we currently have
01:49:06 get rid of the fucking common core
01:49:08 nobody needs history this fucking badly
01:49:10 put him in something else
01:49:12 cut a bunch of bullshit out, restructure it
01:49:14 then after ninth grade
01:49:16 have three years of trade school
01:49:18 they can pick whichever one they want to go to
01:49:20 because even if they don't get a job in that field
01:49:22 it doesn't matter because just like college
01:49:24 you'll pick up a bunch of life skills
01:49:26 if you learn how to
01:49:28 become, let's say
01:49:30 a computer programmer those skills
01:49:32 will help you forever in
01:49:34 everything and my advice
01:49:36 to our audience
01:49:38 don't go to college, go on google
01:49:40 type in the phrase what is code
01:49:42 and read the bloomberg article
01:49:44 that's 34,000 words long
01:49:46 it teaches you everything in a very
01:49:48 pleasant format that's easy
01:49:50 to understand and learn
01:49:52 what code is and then learn how to code
01:49:54 and code everything forever because
01:49:56 you are an inexhaustible resource
01:49:58 that everyone needs in the world
01:50:00 and there you have it
01:50:02 those are our solutions
01:50:04 that's uh, you know
01:50:06 just go do it folks and hey if you want to tell stories about
01:50:08 your nightmare college shit just leave in the comments
