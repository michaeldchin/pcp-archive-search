00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber where I train
00:00:09 my ability to complain. I'm Tom Oliver and today I'm going to be drinking Fireball Cinnamon
00:00:16 Whiskey. That is today's wine. It was provided for me by the best guy ever two years ago when
00:00:24 he came to my house. It's been sitting here ever since and I figured fuck it. I'm down
00:00:29 here. It's right there. Might as well fucking put an end to this Fireball Whiskey. As usual
00:00:35 if you'd like to donate to the Wine Fund to provide wine for the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber
00:00:40 you can do so in the link in the description to my paypal. If you donate of course I will
00:00:44 mention your name in the beginning of the show and we'll give a link to your social
00:00:49 media in the description of the podcast. So today we're going to be talking about being
00:00:56 untalented and how much it fucking blows. So my channel RebelPixels is kind of all about
00:01:04 that idea of being untalented and trying to scavenge some small amount of success with
00:01:14 your lack of ability nonwithstanding. God I'm afraid it has some of those whiskeys who
00:01:19 are sitting here forever but we're just going to fucking go for it my friends. I feel like
00:01:23 I'm going to need some for this. Yep. Yeah so being untalented is something I'm familiar
00:01:34 with. It fucking is not. Okay let me back up for a little bit and let's start with why
00:01:40 I'm talking about this to begin with. For the last hour or so I've been sitting here
00:01:46 working on an illustration for a review of the new tablet that I got in from XPpen. I
00:01:54 know thrilling stuff for anybody who's a PCP regular fucking tablet reviews but I'm doing
00:01:59 a drawing just kind of to record some footage of how the thing works so I usually have to
00:02:03 sit down and do an illustration even though I don't really do illustration much anymore.
00:02:08 Looks on me I suppose for starting a channel about drawing and then immediately getting
00:02:11 out of drawing. So I'm sitting here doing an illustration and I did a sketch on paper.
00:02:16 I always start my illustrations on paper even though I have all these fucking digital shit.
00:02:19 It looked pretty good. I mean it wasn't like amazing nothing I've ever drawn has been amazing
00:02:23 but in terms of like my scale it looked pretty good. So I brought it in to Manga Studio and
00:02:30 started inking it and now it looks like fucking garbage. And I don't know why. It's a kind
00:02:37 of a meme among artists and people who create that sometimes you draw a sketch it looks
00:02:41 pretty dope and then you try and ink it and it completely falls apart. And it's the worst
00:02:45 because you never really quite know why it's happening and usually the only solution is
00:02:49 to scrap your inks and start all over again. But that just kind of like started the whole
00:02:53 kind of snowball effect of like oh these inks looks like shit oh it's because you're a shitty
00:02:57 artist though it's because you have no talent and blah blah blah. It's tough being in the
00:03:03 PCP and drawing and not being good because you know we got Ben we got Mage we're both
00:03:09 really good. I'm not so good and that kind of fucking sucks because it feels like constantly
00:03:17 you got to like prove you have a purpose for being there. And I don't know I definitely
00:03:25 feel like I'm still struggling to find my niche which is weird because all throughout
00:03:31 high school and college and shit I always figured like oh drawing is absolutely what
00:03:34 I wanted to do. I always thought it was kind of laughable that people didn't know what
00:03:39 they wanted to do with their lives or didn't kind of have their thing figured out because
00:03:42 I figured my thing out so early in life like art duh clearly. But that was before the fucking
00:03:48 internet and then you get the internet and you're like holy shit I'm so fucking bad at
00:03:54 this thing that I thought it was actually kind of good at because like this might not
00:03:59 make any sense for you young people who grew up with the internet but back in the day you
00:04:04 only had your immediate surroundings to compare yourself to in terms of ability relative to
00:04:12 your age and your time spent on your craft and in my tiny little pre-internet bubble
00:04:18 I was doing okay. It was pretty you know locally and live in a small town there's like five
00:04:23 other people who draw so the fact they could even draw at all seemed fucking amazing when
00:04:28 considered in a vacuum the personal little vacuum. I said vacuum a lot in the last episode
00:04:33 too what the fuck. Small aside I have this weird tendency with my vocabulary to get stuck
00:04:43 on certain words for a while days weeks months. Vacuum seems to be one of the ones I'm using
00:04:51 right now. Sucks. Whatever. In this tiny little bubble of where I live I seemed like I knew
00:05:01 what I was doing comparatively but then you get high speed internet connection you go on
00:05:05 DVNR and you realize you're fucking garbage and despite the effort I've put in I've been
00:05:13 drawing now for oh my god. I started getting serious in eighth grade eighth ninth grade
00:05:19 something like that freshman year of high school so that would be 12 years of work and
00:05:26 you would never know it by what I create. To put that into perspective Ben has been drawing
00:05:31 for I think three or four years. I mean I don't really even see anything more than that
00:05:37 it's self-explanatory. So I've constantly had I've kind of just had to like realize
00:05:43 you know from I want to say like the middle of high school to today that I don't have
00:05:50 any talent. Looking back at what I've done and where I've been and how far I've come
00:05:56 it's it's it's kind of amazing that I can even do what I do now. All things considered
00:06:02 considering how fucking terrible I was and I like I have a little sister who's 15 right
00:06:08 now and she can draw better than I can today at 15. So it's just like a joke and then my
00:06:19 other sister who's younger than me but older than that sister was consistently better than
00:06:22 me at drawing growing up. So I've never known what it's like to actually have an ability
00:06:27 that actually I seemed like I was proficient at was obviously in the PCP I'd have no no
00:06:31 drawing skill compared to Ben and Mage. I don't have analysis or video making skill compared
00:06:38 to Momkey or Nate or Digi or your analysis skill compared to Digi or personality charisma
00:06:45 compared to Jesse and Momkey. So it's like it's like what do I do. What do I bring to
00:06:52 the table. I was kind of going to say this topic for another time but I guess I guess
00:06:56 we're going straight into it. I feel like in order to be part of something you need to
00:07:03 justify your being there. I don't know what I provide to this group and that really bothers
00:07:10 me because I have this desire and I think we all do. I think we all have the desire and
00:07:14 the want to feel useful to feel like we're providing something. That's a big reason of
00:07:21 why I create things in the first place is because I feel like the ability to create and make
00:07:25 things whether it be you know something as frivolous as art or something as utilitarian
00:07:30 is like you know construction or architecture or things like that. The ability to create
00:07:36 things is what separates us from from other animals. Right. Like we have this ability
00:07:40 to like be cognizant and like create tools and express higher thoughts and creativity
00:07:49 and stuff like that. So I feel like human beings we almost have like an obligation to
00:07:53 use that. That's like that's that's to be human is to express ourselves in some way
00:07:59 to to take advantage of our higher cognitive abilities and whatever direction we find most
00:08:04 resonant with our personalities I suppose. All of that's that's just mandatory and I
00:08:10 really not to get fucking divisive again but I really hate when people have abilities and
00:08:18 squander them or when they don't ever try and kind of explore some sort of higher higher
00:08:26 even the right word but like embrace their humanity you know like do something like so
00:08:31 many people are just passive consumers and it's it's so easy to fall into because our
00:08:36 society is designed to enable passive consumption because that's kind of what keeps the cogs
00:08:41 of everything going is you know we live in this weird kind of structure where if people
00:08:48 stopped buying things for a day the entire fucking system would just fall apart. You
00:08:54 know it's it's necessitating constant consumption which is a whole other you know fucking can
00:09:00 of worms we could open up in terms of like problems but human beings are are capable
00:09:07 of more than consumption you know because what what is it that animals do animals consume
00:09:13 that's it you know they go around they look for food and they fuck and they try not to
00:09:17 die and that's all an animal does they're they're they're they're they're blatant rampant consumers
00:09:23 and nature kind of has a way of providing checks and balances to make sure nothing kind
00:09:26 of gets out of whack and that's that's what life really is like we want to get down to
00:09:32 the nitty-gritty of like like the the state of nature is like consuming and doing your
00:09:37 best not to be consumed so when human beings are given more cognitive tools to do more
00:09:46 than merely consume but then we've created a culture that kind of incentivizes being
00:09:52 animals it's kind of sad and I'm going way off on a tangent but I think we all have a
00:09:59 responsibility to be more than animals to take the the gifts we've been given as human
00:10:05 beings and apply them as effectively as we can in a way that's most complimentary to
00:10:13 our skill sets I am trying to do that to the best of my ability and ever since finding
00:10:21 the internet and realizing that I'm not good at drawing like I thought I was as a kid and
00:10:26 realizing that there are so many people better and that for the amount of time I've put in
00:10:31 over a decade of work and not getting anywhere near as far as I should I've still improved
00:10:35 leaps and bounds but like when you start from such a huge deficit that's not saying a lot
00:10:40 I'm trying to find something else and I've been working on that you know like videos
00:10:44 were the first thing like okay I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna try making videos cuz people
00:10:49 seem to like these even though I've never had any interest in it and that was a huge
00:10:52 flop more whiskey oh fuck a little bit just got into the cut on my lip out okay whatever
00:11:00 um videos didn't really work out for me not my thing and didn't work out long term then I did
00:11:08 writing and I'm still kind of in the midst of writing writing seems a bit better but the
00:11:12 problem is like with writing twofold problem number one with writing is that not a lot of
00:11:20 people care and I am so bad at real life I can't hold down a job I can't work a real job I can
00:11:30 barely get hired for a real job it's a miracle that I got the fucking security guard job that I
00:11:36 got and it's cuz I had connections I would never would have been able to land it on my own I need
00:11:41 to be an internet man because I have no other really possible career path at this point it's
00:11:48 this or like die in the streets and that's it so I gotta make that work and writing is very
00:11:56 difficult to do that I've done so much research on like how people make money being authors other
00:12:02 than just like you know becoming published and get super fucking successful and famous and shit
00:12:06 like that and like so it seems to be like you need to create like classes on how to write and how
00:12:12 to like get an email list and how to promote your stuff and like I could do that I have the
00:12:17 technical ability to do that I just don't I don't have enough experience so in order to like get
00:12:23 to the point where I can make money writing is actually not making money writing it's making
00:12:28 money teaching other people who want to write how to write effectively and I can't really teach
00:12:32 that if I haven't done it myself yet so it's just like oh that's that's it's like years of
00:12:36 grind before I can really get to that point so writing just seems like a fiscal dead end despite
00:12:41 having some passion for it but then the other problem with writing is that now we have fucking
00:12:45 monkey coming in who's way better at writing and has a book deal and is getting all that shit done
00:12:51 and then I guess Jesse's writing and Jesse's a fucking genius so he's great at writing so just
00:12:56 like alright this is just drawing all over again once I'm exposed to other you know writers it's
00:13:01 like oh well I don't really have the chops there that I thought I did either so that's that's a
00:13:06 fucking fail and I'm gonna stop you right there viewer who's thinking Tom you're a fucking idiot
00:13:12 you shouldn't be comparing yourself to other people because I hear that line all the time and
00:13:16 it fucking pisses me off and I'll tell you why the pisses me off because you have to okay in the
00:13:22 magical fairyland of dreams and like magic where where nothing fucking matters of course you don't
00:13:29 compare yourself to other people you just sit down and you do your thing and everything's great
00:13:33 you have a good time but unfortunately we live on planet earth where everything's fucking terrible
00:13:38 and on planet fucking miserable shit whole rock land okay you have to compare yourself to other
00:13:44 people because life is a competition you exist to crush other people under your heel and be better
00:13:52 than them everything that you gain in life is at the expense of somebody else every product you
00:13:58 ever bought everything you've ever consumed everything you've ever you know watched or read or
00:14:03 done was at the expense of someone else's time money and effort so you have to compete life is
00:14:11 competition and the only way you can kind of like gauge where you're at with certain things is to look
00:14:16 out into the world and understand where you fall in the hierarchy I can sit here and draw by myself
00:14:23 and ignore everybody else like I'm just gonna draw for me but I'm never gonna get anywhere
00:14:26 because if I don't know where I fall and where I need to improve and where I need to get better
00:14:30 or just like be like hey Tom guess what you don't you're not cut out for this shit you know
00:14:35 you're never you're never gonna know you're never gonna be able to be successful because you
00:14:39 have to be cognizant of your comparative value in whatever you're doing like I could sit here
00:14:48 in my room I just like I'm gonna do fucking physics I want to do physics but I don't know
00:14:54 shit about physics so if I just sat here it's like yeah I'm just gonna do my thing I'd never get
00:14:58 anywhere with it like you have to look out into the world and understand where you fall in the
00:15:02 pecking order to understand okay am I any good at this where do I need to improve what am I doing
00:15:08 wrong and is this even viable because it's not just about being happy it's about being happy
00:15:14 while having enough money so they don't fucking die when you're born into this world your life is
00:15:18 a burden okay that's what oh god I'm gonna get political that's what capitalism is about and I'm
00:15:23 not I don't hate capitalism but I definitely think that it kind of sucks that everybody
00:15:30 who's ever been born and ever will be born until we fucking become starfleet uh is
00:15:37 instantly at risk of death of of of just self-inflicted death and that you in order to subsist
00:15:43 you have to constantly be producing something of value in a vacuum did it again that's kind of a
00:15:49 good idea like motivating people to constantly be uh doing something valuable but the problem is what
00:15:55 you think is valuable isn't necessarily valuable I think working on source was lost and writing
00:16:03 is valuable I find it valuable nobody else finds it valuable I only find it valuable so the things
00:16:11 I have to do things that have objective value that have social value that have social
00:16:15 practical purposes and that means walking around an abandoned building for 40 hours a week I have
00:16:21 no interest in doing that has no value to me in terms of like interest but the value it provides
00:16:26 me is currency and the it helps whoever owns the fucking building that's the social value
00:16:34 it's fucking dumb so you need to compare yourself with your skills and your talents and
00:16:40 your interests in order to understand will this provide value because drawing people want drawings
00:16:46 people want art there are people out there who patron artists so drawing as a medium has value
00:16:52 has potential value but if you're so far down the rungs of the the hierarchy and there are so many
00:16:59 people above you you inevitably there's a fall off the lower you go down the rungs the less your
00:17:06 talent becomes valuable because there are people who can do it better and if you have the choice
00:17:11 between a and b and a is better than b you're gonna go with a because a is superior so the
00:17:19 worst you are the less value you have in the world so I'm at the point where it's just like okay my
00:17:25 drawing is is borderline valueless because it's just so much worse than the people around me
00:17:32 compared to the time I've put into it and and I'm hitting this kind of glass ceiling in terms
00:17:37 of just like the amount of time it would take to become valuable in this skill is so gargantuan
00:17:42 and so massive and such like a steep ascent to get to that it almost becomes a worthless endeavor
00:17:49 because by the time it becomes valuable I'm like five years dead in the streets because I haven't
00:17:54 done anything else it's bullshit and it sucks so I can't draw my videos aren't as good as anybody
00:18:04 else's in the pcp I don't really have any charisma or charismatic personality that can carry anything
00:18:12 I do you know right now I'm getting slowly buzzed off of my not wine and I'm sure I sound like a
00:18:18 raving lunatic so what do I have to offer right if everything is about value and you come here
00:18:26 to listen to podcasts and be entertained by the people in this group because they're providing
00:18:31 some entertainment value to you if I'm not providing anything in that sphere why am I here
00:18:39 you know I want to earn my seat at the table but I feel like I'm ill-equipped in terms of skill set
00:18:44 to provide anything that isn't overlapping and underdeveloped compared to other people I don't
00:18:50 draw better than Ben I don't write better than monkey I don't make better videos than digi and
00:18:55 I don't have a better personality than Jesse I'm a knockoff shittier version of everybody else
00:19:03 so what's the fucking point like what do I provide here other than complaining anybody can
00:19:09 complain this isn't a skill this is just an outlet for frustration you know my channel rebel pixels
00:19:17 people like it because they're like you're such a failure I resonate with your failure and that's
00:19:23 why I'm attracted to some of your videos because I can understand and sympathize with your feelings
00:19:29 of inadequacy if my most valuable thing is providing comfort for other failures why the
00:19:35 fuck would I even bother like that's that's so fucking demoralizing it's like yeah you draw
00:19:40 yeah you write yeah you do this but the fact that you fail the way I do is what really attracts me
00:19:45 to you misery loves company so I'm gonna hang out with you like like that's grounds for fucking
00:19:50 blowing my brains out right there like fuck that like oh god so shitty I fucking hate it oh so what
00:19:58 what do I do what do I do I don't know what I do what was this podcast even about it's about
00:20:03 not having talent so I guess I guess we're still semi-on topic I don't have an ego I don't have
00:20:09 confidence I would like to I think it's valuable I don't know how to do it but I do have ego at
00:20:17 the same time it's weird I don't really know how to describe it maybe maybe you guys are familiar
00:20:23 with this in that like you have an ego but it's repressed like you can't express it because it
00:20:30 makes you angry or something I don't really know because like if I just sit down and ask myself like
00:20:38 do I want to be better than all these people in the pcp of course I do I think that's not rude to
00:20:43 say like why would I not want to be more successful than people around me again if everything's a
00:20:49 comparison and everything's a competition then in order to thrive you have to win I want to win
00:20:55 clearly because I don't want to be fucking dead I mean that pendulum swing in the other way with
00:21:00 every day but we're still we're still on live live land right now so if I'm going to be alive I want
00:21:07 to win and I want to be the best guy clearly I think everybody wants to be the best guy if they're
00:21:13 being honest with themselves like who doesn't want to be the best guy right I'm gonna be the best you
00:21:17 can be well if the best you can be fucking blows what if it's like like like the lowest tier that's
00:21:23 the best you can be nobody wants to be the best they can be if it's fucking shitty still everybody
00:21:27 wants to be the best guy so I want to be the best guy I want to be the best writer I want to be the
00:21:34 best artist I want to be the best video maker I want to be the best of everything but I can't be
00:21:38 the best of everything I can barely be competent at anything I don't know what I bring to the table
00:21:46 that isn't done better by somebody else so sometimes I just ask myself why I'm even here
00:21:52 like why bother like should I just leave should I just let let these guys do their thing and and
00:21:58 not fucking weigh them down with like this excess baggage of like yeah we got Ben he's a good
00:22:04 artist we got made she's a good artist we got monkey he's he's got a book deal going and and
00:22:09 we got like all these guys doing great videos with like really charismatic personalities
00:22:13 and sweet editing and really analytical points and then Tom well we've known him for a while he just
00:22:18 he kind of does this thing if I had met these guys now and not back during the horse days
00:22:25 none of them would give a fuck about me and I'm so fucking aware of this and it's not spoken but
00:22:32 I'm saying it now it's so fucking obvious that the only reason I'm still here is because of the
00:22:39 history we have nothing I'm doing in the moment has any value or any interest to anybody else on
00:22:47 this fucking channel oh you review graphics tablets who fucking cares I barely fucking care
00:22:54 it was an accident that it even happened what else you do oh you talk about how depressed you are
00:22:59 and how creativity is hard no fucking shit we all know that we're all doing it none of them would pay
00:23:06 rebel pixels any mind they barely do now which I don't blame them because it did fuck who cares
00:23:14 I barely care and I make the damn things none of it matters it's unimportant and it's unimpressive
00:23:23 I have no reason to be in this group and I'm desperate to to earn my seat again
00:23:29 back in the day when we first met and we were all doing gay horse faggot shit
00:23:35 I earned my seat I was the second biggest guy after digi
00:23:40 and I built that from nothing granted it was off the back of a fandom which kind of invalidates
00:23:46 all of the accomplishments but it was mine and I did it and I felt like I had earned my seat there
00:23:53 at the table of the horseshoe crew I belonged I I was there for a reason you know I was doing
00:24:01 something now I don't I don't do anything of value I don't do anything worth doing and everything
00:24:09 that I can do is done better by somebody else we're friends we're all friends but we definitely
00:24:17 are very aware of our creativity and and the things that we make and we prescribe a lot of value
00:24:24 to ourselves and everybody else based on what they make and I know my social currency and my
00:24:31 social credit in this group is is dwindling rapidly nobody wants to say it but I can see the
00:24:38 writing on the wall I'm not providing anything I just want to be good at something I don't know
00:24:46 if that's like it must be nice maybe I'm just too fucking depressed and full of self-hatred to
00:24:55 recognize my own skills but again skills in isolation don't mean anything it has to be
00:25:02 you have to look out into the world and compare favorably and even if I could come to terms with
00:25:08 the fact that oh I do good things in isolation it doesn't matter because in the real world compared
00:25:16 to other people none of it's any good so I either need to get really fucking good at something
00:25:24 or do something new that nobody else in the group does and say that's my thing
00:25:30 he's the guy who does that and that's why he's here
00:25:33 because right now I don't do shit and it's just only a matter of time before I just
00:25:45 get kicked out because he's not doing anything I think I already would have been kicked out
00:25:51 if I didn't have history with these guys I don't I don't do anything hi I'm I'm done
00:26:02 there's been hyperbolic wine chamber lots of whining today let me know if you want me to get
00:26:09 a specific one donate in the link and I'll get it next time
