00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:30 not joking. I looked over the comments and the consensus cash money. Don't worry, I will
00:00:43 use my god powers responsibly. You wouldn't have them if you were going to use them responsibly.
00:00:51 If I don't, the police are standing by. Anyway, Ben Saint, welcome.
00:01:04 Little Ben, John Saint. There is Lil John Buuh, my favorite guy.
00:01:17 I don't want to be on the podcast this week. It's because I stayed up all night last night.
00:01:23 Typical Ben.
00:01:24 Crossing animals.
00:01:25 Oh yes, let's get right into it. Yes, tell us about it, Ben. Tell us about it.
00:01:31 Well, I'll tell you this.
00:01:32 I've had development.
00:01:33 I'll tell you the struggle. I'll tell you the struggle. First, I had to catch the new
00:01:38 sea fish. I had two nights ago.
00:01:41 I caught a new butterfly today. It was based. It was green.
00:01:45 I loved it.
00:01:46 Did you have your bird wing?
00:01:48 You know what? I'll pull it up right now.
00:01:51 I'll tell you in just a second.
00:01:52 Well, a couple nights ago, I had Ethan and Kazi over my island because it was raining.
00:01:59 We all kind of visited each other's islands, but it was raining. There was a thunderstorm
00:02:03 and they both were like, while I'm here, I'm going to catch a sealocanth. We all fished
00:02:09 and everyone caught a sealocanth. Even I caught a sealocanth. I didn't even want one.
00:02:13 Oh, wait, wait, wait.
00:02:14 I forgot.
00:02:16 I forgot that the reason we were doing it was because Kazi had like a meteor shower and
00:02:21 so we're all there.
00:02:22 Bro, I've been nuts with the meteor showers. I found like a hundred meteors in the sky
00:02:26 the first time, literally. Over a hundred.
00:02:28 I think I didn't know what to look for, but now that I know what the sound is to listen
00:02:32 for, I feel like maybe they've been happening more often than I thought.
00:02:36 Yeah, I think so.
00:02:38 But I got it today. I just happened to log in and Isabelle's like, by the way, tonight
00:02:43 there's going to be a meteor shower, so watch the fuck out, which I assume means there's
00:02:47 going to be like a lots, which is pretty neat.
00:02:50 Guess so.
00:02:51 But anyway, so the other night they were doing that. We made wishes, caught sealocanth. Everyone
00:02:56 had a sealocanth. It was great, but I didn't want a sealocanth. I wanted the barrel eye,
00:03:02 which is another weird rare fish, and I hunted for it and I managed to find, you know, the
00:03:09 barrel eye was my white whale, you might say, and I got two of them legendary. But last
00:03:15 night I was like, well, there's a couple more fish I haven't got. I need the mahi mahi,
00:03:19 and I need the giant terravale, terravel, whatever.
00:03:27 Don't know it.
00:03:28 And so I fucking took me to like five in the morning. I don't know why. It was so hard to
00:03:35 get these two stupid fish. I don't even like them that much. I mean, they're fine, whatever.
00:03:38 But I did. I did it. And then I was like, I was up, and I was like, well, I can't go
00:03:43 to sleep now. And you know, I've been meaning to terraform my island and turn my little corner
00:03:49 of Yakitori Island into a steam and steel steampunk nightmare, a mountain fortress.
00:03:57 So I just started doing that. I just started building up giant walls, like three level
00:04:03 high walls around my little peninsula. And you know, things will have to move to accommodate
00:04:12 it. But it's just sort of the initial, just sort of the initial planning stages of my
00:04:17 industrial hellscape. You know, things will, but you know, it takes a long. It's so fucking
00:04:24 hard to get like a clean edge.
00:04:27 I know, it's a true nightmare.
00:04:29 To even get like the edge that you want on like your river or your cliff is hard enough.
00:04:34 But to like get the river edge and the cliff edge, like to match each other on like, and
00:04:41 then to smooth out the cliff on both sides, including one adjacent to a river, like is
00:04:47 so it's so it's awful. It's just terrible.
00:04:50 Took it.
00:04:51 Did not have a plan for that one.
00:04:52 So, you know, that took me another like five hours. And it's not, and it's all not even,
00:04:58 and it's only even in the planning stages. It's still very much a work in progress, but
00:05:02 well, if it was easy, if it was easy, then everyone would lose interest with this shit
00:05:06 game instantly.
00:05:07 It's so poorly optimized.
00:05:09 That's true.
00:05:10 But of course, feature not a buff.
00:05:12 Punked.
00:05:13 But no one will ever lose interest in Animal Crossing, New Horizons, certainly not now
00:05:18 that I just like nobody ever stopped playing the previous seven million games in the Animal
00:05:23 Crossing series.
00:05:25 Correct.
00:05:26 Correct.
00:05:27 Well, they live on, well, they live on as confusing counter data that you might find
00:05:33 while browsing a wiki.
00:05:35 That's true.
00:05:36 That's true.
00:05:37 They live on, they live on as misinformation telling you about when Nook's cranny opens
00:05:41 in the morning or whatever.
00:05:44 Truly their legacy is eternal.
00:05:46 Yes.
00:05:47 Thank you. Thank you, Tetus. Appreciate the contribution. It was a peacock butterfly,
00:05:52 which apparently has been available for quite a while, but I only caught it this morning.
00:05:56 Well, you know what?
00:05:57 Looking in my museum, my butterfly exhibit is looking tight as hell.
00:06:00 Well, you know why?
00:06:01 It's going to be voluminous.
00:06:02 I have a guess why you might have just caught the peacock butterfly.
00:06:05 Yeah.
00:06:06 It only appears when you have black flowers, which I do here and there.
00:06:11 Oh, fascinating.
00:06:12 So if you maybe just newly acquired those, you might now start seeing those we didn't
00:06:15 before.
00:06:16 I mean, we probably started doing our flower breeding maybe like a week or two ago.
00:06:20 Wait, wait, wait.
00:06:21 It's not just black.
00:06:22 It's like black or blue or purple, I think, so.
00:06:24 Okay.
00:06:25 Yeah.
00:06:27 The point is you need some crossbreeds to get a bunch of different bug types, but in
00:06:31 particular, the peacocks are good.
00:06:34 They're one of the more valuable ones, and they're not even, and then once you have the
00:06:38 flowers you need, they're pretty common, too.
00:06:40 So they're big moneymakers.
00:06:41 So Ben, did you...
00:06:42 An animal crossing sucks.
00:06:44 No.
00:06:45 Nintendo Switch sucks.
00:06:46 No.
00:06:47 Nintendo sucks.
00:06:48 I haven't made a good scene.
00:06:49 Hey, you idiot, complaining just because we're talking about a video game you're not
00:06:55 interested in.
00:06:56 Why don't you get with it, Scrub?
00:06:58 I say, sewing, moments before I will be suffering through another hour's long monologue about
00:07:03 Final Fantasy VII and thereby reaping.
00:07:07 Indeed.
00:07:08 Yeah.
00:07:09 Truly, that is a bra moment to which I say...
00:07:13 Bozinga.
00:07:14 Thank you.
00:07:15 Thank you, Ben.
00:07:16 What were you asking?
00:07:17 Did you rise with the morning sun as I did, Ben, of course, and I believe I saw that
00:07:21 you did.
00:07:22 Invest all your bells and turnips this bright and shiny capitalist morning.
00:07:25 I'm close.
00:07:26 I know I did.
00:07:27 I invested a fuck ton of bells.
00:07:29 I put 700K down for those turnips this morning.
00:07:35 All my savings, basically.
00:07:36 That's all your savings?
00:07:37 Chewah.
00:07:38 Yep, pretty much.
00:07:39 Okay.
00:07:40 We're gonna have to collaborate to make sure we don't lose our investments.
00:07:42 Yes, of course.
00:07:44 Of course.
00:07:45 I had about three and a half million in the bank, which I technically owe most of it to
00:07:51 Tom Nook, but I don't gain anything by paying it back, so I'm just putting that off until
00:07:56 it's not a...
00:07:57 So you've achieved your final expansion or whatever?
00:07:59 Yeah.
00:08:00 Yeah, I've got the final expansion, but I haven't paid it off, but you don't get very
00:08:03 much for paying it off, so whatever.
00:08:05 I had to just wait till Bernie gets elected and he'll just absolve you of that.
00:08:10 No problem.
00:08:11 Tom Nook will be dragged into Central Park in shot.
00:08:16 He...
00:08:17 Wait, wait, wait.
00:08:19 Oh.
00:08:20 What was it?
00:08:21 You're dead.
00:08:22 You're 3 million in the bank.
00:08:23 Oh, yeah.
00:08:24 I was gonna just invest all of it.
00:08:25 I was gonna invest all of it in turnips, but it actually got...
00:08:29 I had to buy so many turnips that I realized that that would have been eight or 10 full
00:08:37 inventory loads, like you had to fill my entire inventory with turnips and go back and forth
00:08:42 to an island, because we're gonna collaborate, you know, we've all got an old Discord server
00:08:47 where you compare turnip prices.
00:08:48 Yes, we do.
00:08:49 The turnip?
00:08:50 And I realized, like, I'm gonna have to go back, I'm gonna make like 10 trips, I don't
00:08:54 want them, that's tedious, so it actually, it was out of sheer, like, this is boring
00:08:58 and it's tedious, I don't wanna buy any more turnips that I stopped.
00:09:01 Truly, you have hit the skill ceiling of Animal Crossing when you start to feel that way.
00:09:05 Skill ceiling is how many turnips can I fit in my inventory?
00:09:09 And deal with the horrible mon...
00:09:12 Not to mention, you can't even store them, you have to place them in the island and then
00:09:15 you have to walk around and pick them up.
00:09:17 Just save you...
00:09:18 I'm not willing to place them on the island because I share my island and people and I
00:09:22 won't look...
00:09:23 Right, right.
00:09:24 No, I had to fill my house with them.
00:09:25 I had to take up most of the furniture, which, to be fair, most of my rooms are pretty sparsely
00:09:29 furnished anyway, so it wasn't that big of a problem.
00:09:31 I picked up all my furniture.
00:09:32 Now my attic, my basement, and two of my side rooms are all entirely filled, like, wall-to-wall
00:09:41 with turnips, and there's a few more in my back room as well.
00:09:45 And that is 2 million bells worth of turnips.
00:09:48 That is 4,000 turnips, I think is the number, or no, 40,000, no, 20,000, it's 20,000 turnips.
00:09:58 Now Ben, you and I are in this together, both heavily investing, so we turn up trackers.
00:10:04 Our stonks must reign supreme, so we will all collab in our server, in our secret investor
00:10:10 club where we will obtain glory.
00:10:12 And you know, I think it was Steve was red-pilling me.
00:10:15 We're all going to be billionaires.
00:10:17 Indeed, indeed.
00:10:18 Steve was red-pilling me, I believe, or maybe it was Ethan, I forget.
00:10:21 On the whole, there are online communities where people coordinate on stuff.
00:10:25 That's gay.
00:10:26 I don't want to do that.
00:10:27 It's too much work and too uncool, not interested.
00:10:31 If we have even like two or three people, our odds of turning the profit are, like, enormous.
00:10:37 Yeah, no doubt.
00:10:38 It's like incredibly unlikely.
00:10:39 Cassey hooked me up.
00:10:41 Cassey had the big spike, 315 bells per turnip.
00:10:46 Ooh, the profits were out of this world, paid off my house experience immediately.
00:10:50 Seika messaged me this week to say that her price has spiked to, like, 400, but I didn't
00:10:55 have any bells.
00:10:56 I didn't have any bells at the time.
00:10:58 I did get a spike that big once in the past, but I didn't have as many bells to invest
00:11:03 at the time.
00:11:04 I think I only had, like, 200k invested or something.
00:11:07 It was a huge win-fall at the time, but it's nothing compared to what I expect this week.
00:11:11 It was bringing me back to watching the stock market in Endless War, all those years ago,
00:11:16 the glory days, and sparring in the dojo, investing your slime and slime coin, watching
00:11:21 that market rise.
00:11:23 And one final question, Oben.
00:11:25 Is there actually, lol, he's dead, guys, epic.
00:11:30 Is there much to be gained with the amount of bells that one had, like, the millions
00:11:34 and millions?
00:11:35 What do you actually do with those?
00:11:36 That's been my only question.
00:11:38 I mean, mainly, you would just buy, I mean, there are some furniture items that are, like,
00:11:45 obscenely expensive, like, in the hundreds of thousands of bells.
00:11:49 So, I mean, if I wanted, if I wanted, like, you know, like, 20 grandfather clocks or something,
00:11:58 then I might actually need, like, millions of bells to do that.
00:12:01 Okay, okay, fair enough.
00:12:03 Yeah.
00:12:04 So it's not, it's not like, it's, I mean, if you hit, like, 10 million bells, then you're
00:12:09 probably at the point where, like, there's not much that I can't do anymore.
00:12:13 Right, right.
00:12:14 But I'm not quite there.
00:12:15 I was even thinking of, like, maybe, like, actually, this is one thing.
00:12:19 Where everyone harassed Steve online, because Steve has more privilege than anyone else in
00:12:24 the world playing Animal Crossing, because Kazian for me, he has the recipe for Sakura
00:12:29 lanterns.
00:12:30 He's the only man I know.
00:12:32 And these are the most beautiful, like, pink, glowing, made with the Sakura petals from
00:12:37 Spring Lanterns.
00:12:38 And now I understand the cruel, cruel mistress that is the, what is it, the making shit system
00:12:45 in this game, the DIY recipe system.
00:12:48 And I want those Sakura lanterns, and even having infinite money, like, I don't even
00:12:53 know if anyone would want all that money.
00:12:56 You have to have something to trade them, I guess.
00:12:58 I just barely missed my chance to learn from one of Ethan's villagers a recipe for a golden
00:13:04 candelabra, which I'm a little disappointed by, but, you know, I came home and my best
00:13:12 friend, Carlos, who I now have a poster hanging of in my main foyer, because he's my bro, he's
00:13:19 the coolest guy.
00:13:20 I assume he has a poster of you, too, I would hope.
00:13:24 I should...
00:13:25 Oh, oh no.
00:13:27 Maybe you can give him one?
00:13:28 What does this mean?
00:13:29 I mean, yeah, obviously he does.
00:13:32 Yeah, of course.
00:13:33 Okay, good.
00:13:34 Well, I mean, but he wears the jacket that I gave him, like, half the time.
00:13:38 That goes a long way.
00:13:39 And, you know, he looks really great.
00:13:41 Like, his girth is, like, stuffed into it in a very flattering way.
00:13:46 Fantastic.
00:13:48 But he gave me a recipe for, like, an iron, like, doorcrest, which is like a shield.
00:13:55 It's like black iron with, like, a shield with lions, and it looks so fucking sick.
00:13:59 It's way better than any golden candelabra.
00:14:02 Sick.
00:14:03 So, yeah, I only got...
00:14:06 The only, like, Sakura recipe I got was, like, the Sakura Pondstone, which is, like, dumb.
00:14:12 It sucks.
00:14:13 I think I have one of those.
00:14:14 It's okay.
00:14:15 Yeah, I didn't...
00:14:16 I didn't...
00:14:17 You know, I caught Sakura pedals.
00:14:19 Like, I didn't, like, I was no slouch about catching them.
00:14:23 I don't know why I didn't get more recipes, because, like, there were some that looked
00:14:27 really nice, like the Sakura lanterns and the Sakura bag was pretty good.
00:14:31 But, like, I don't know, I guess I missed my chance until next March or whatever.
00:14:37 Until the cruel question looms its head, now that I'm bored, is it finally time to start
00:14:41 time traveling?
00:14:42 Oh, that's what I'm thinking.
00:14:43 Right now, I'm able to hold off the demons.
00:14:44 My switch owner said his condition for us playing on his island was, you can do whatever
00:14:52 you want, but no time traveling.
00:14:55 But perhaps a Judas, a Brutus, backstabbing.
00:14:58 It's for fake gamers, he said.
00:15:00 And we signed the pact in blood that we wouldn't be fake gamers.
00:15:04 Well, understandable, understandable.
00:15:08 The quest continues onward for Animal Crossing Dominance and Supremacy.
00:15:12 We should've played the jingle.
00:15:13 Okay, whatever.
00:15:14 Bum, bub, bub, Ben St. Animal Crossing Hour.
00:15:18 Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.
00:15:19 And I have a lot of, and I have a lot of black roses and a lot of purple ones too.
00:15:24 And I gave Kazi some black and pink ones, because she wanted them, and it was cool.
00:15:28 And that's the story.
00:15:31 Ah, fascinating as always.
00:15:34 Eleazar, put in timestamp this moment in the description.
00:15:38 Podcast starts here.
00:15:40 No.
00:15:41 Lord of Ghost, Lord of Ghost chapter seven is out.
00:15:45 Act two is finished.
00:15:46 Oh, I read it and I loved it.
00:15:48 I have not read Act seven yet.
00:15:51 Acts, you mean chapter seven, but yes.
00:15:53 Okay, yes, sure.
00:15:54 It's, it's, it's, it's really cool.
00:15:56 Don't say Act seven.
00:15:57 I have bad connotations with Act seven.
00:16:01 Wait, Act seven is actually okay.
00:16:02 That's the one page flash, right?
00:16:03 Act six is the bad one.
00:16:05 Uh, yes.
00:16:07 Okay, all right.
00:16:07 No mind.
00:16:08 Would be fine if Act six didn't exist.
00:16:11 Right, right.
00:16:12 You are right.
00:16:13 It's always been my opinion.
00:16:14 Okay.
00:16:15 Read Lord of Ghosts, everybody.
00:16:16 It is great and I did love it.
00:16:18 And the events that transpire, I will not spoil, but who, baby, it's great.
00:16:24 I really like it.
00:16:25 Yeah, it's, it's, it was a start of the little like, I wonder if I could make it
00:16:30 like a real comic sort of thing.
00:16:32 And it's, it's pretty, it's pretty close to something that's like, yeah, you
00:16:36 know, like actually good people saying, oh my God, I didn't realize you had any
00:16:40 talents at all.
00:16:41 Lol.
00:16:41 Lol, haha, dude, I say that all the time.
00:16:44 Um, I'm tempted to, I'm tempted to ignore you guys for a while and go read it
00:16:50 right now on, on the podcast, haha, but not tell you that I'm doing that or
00:16:55 anything.
00:16:56 Well, that would be so crazy if you did that, but it's not that long.
00:16:59 So it wouldn't be that big of a deal.
00:17:02 Yeah.
00:17:02 Well, I will, I will say that for now, for the next three or so months, it's
00:17:09 going on hiatus for a very specific, important reason that I am going to apply
00:17:15 for the Tezuka Award contest thing, manga contest show in Japan.
00:17:23 I will submit a manga and I have to make that in three months, which is why I
00:17:29 can't really work on Lord of Ghosts because the maximum page, I'm already
00:17:34 way over that with Lord of Ghosts.
00:17:35 It's like almost a hundred pages now.
00:17:38 I see, I see.
00:17:39 How, so to tell me about the specifics, I'm very curious about this and how, how
00:17:43 you plan to go about it, just technically speaking.
00:17:45 Right.
00:17:46 So the Tezuka thing, it's the 100th anniversary of the thing.
00:17:52 If you, it's the thing, it's, and they're opening it up to Spanish speaking, English
00:17:57 speaking, I think Chinese and Korean speaking countries for the first time.
00:18:02 So it's always been a Japanese manga contest.
00:18:05 Aitra Oda submitted famously.
00:18:08 And you got second place, second place, baby.
00:18:11 Yeah, I have no, I have no like delusions of grandeur that I'm ever going to get
00:18:16 anywhere close because it's like, there's so many people who could enter and
00:18:20 there's so much talent out there.
00:18:22 But I think it would not be, it would be pretty cringe if I didn't try just
00:18:28 because of that.
00:18:29 So I'm going to, I'm going to take an idea.
00:18:33 I've come up with a little, little plot and I'm going to make a 30 page manga.
00:18:40 It has to read right to left, but they will translate it for you before it
00:18:45 gets sent to the Japanese where they will judge it.
00:18:48 I don't expect, I, the way I'm expecting it to happen, there's no like
00:18:52 information, but like the judges include Akira Toriyama and Aitra Oda and some
00:18:57 other people that I can't remember the names of.
00:19:00 So like if it gets to them and my comic appears in front of them, that would be
00:19:03 incredible, but I feel like there's, there's only five of them.
00:19:07 Let me just get the link to the thing.
00:19:09 Sure, sure.
00:19:10 I assume they probably won't like read every single one.
00:19:13 There's probably got to be some filter before it gets to those guys.
00:19:16 There's got to be a filter.
00:19:17 So here it is.
00:19:19 So the people is Aitra Oda, Kazue Kato, Kohei Hirokoishi.
00:19:28 I can't see his names, but they're notable people, obviously.
00:19:32 Yeah, yeah.
00:19:33 Looks like the creators of Bokunohiro, Slam Dunk.
00:19:37 I don't know.
00:19:38 Is that fucking sorted on?
00:19:40 I don't know what that is.
00:19:40 One piece, Dragon Ball and Blue Exorcist, Kazue Kato.
00:19:44 Oh my God.
00:19:47 I'm sorry.
00:19:47 I've just arrived at a twist in a certain webcomic that I am not currently
00:19:55 reading while you discuss something that I haven't been paying attention to.
00:19:59 Does it have anything to do with a problematic creature?
00:20:05 Yes.
00:20:07 OK, all right, all right.
00:20:08 Probably.
00:20:09 You could probably say that about a lot of things, though.
00:20:12 Well, I think there'd be a more obvious yes.
00:20:14 If it's OK, maybe I'm wrong.
00:20:15 OK, anyway, I think.
00:20:17 Oh, no, I see what she's mean.
00:20:19 I see what she's mean.
00:20:20 OK, no, that wasn't even the one I was talking about.
00:20:24 Oh, fuck.
00:20:25 All right, Jesus, fucking Christ.
00:20:27 Oh my God, I just want to say, since you're OK, I won't I won't spoil it.
00:20:29 But like the way that you do the very end of that chapter, you build it up
00:20:33 and you just you just give that little joke at the end.
00:20:36 Perfect.
00:20:37 Mwah, the best.
00:20:38 You don't end on a big, gay, total thing.
00:20:41 It's the I love it.
00:20:42 I just love the way that was done.
00:20:44 That's why you're going to win the Tezuka Award.
00:20:46 I believe in you.
00:20:47 The whole thing is a big, gay, total thing.
00:20:52 Yeah, you're right.
00:20:53 You're right.
00:20:56 Well, yeah, they got the.
00:20:59 Japanese people, I hope that it would get to them,
00:21:02 but I'm pretty sure there's going to be like thousands of other people
00:21:06 vetting, like choosing the wheat from the chaff.
00:21:10 Got to be, got to be.
00:21:12 Hopefully, these guys will probably see the finalists get me far.
00:21:16 I don't I don't I don't want to try and be like, oh, I have to be Japanese
00:21:19 and exactly like everyone else if I want to win.
00:21:21 Right, you just got to be cool.
00:21:22 Yeah, that's what that's what I'm sure that's true.
00:21:27 Thinking back to his style and how he's always been like very different.
00:21:30 You know, it's it's funny.
00:21:31 There's definitely like a generic anime look like the A1 pictures look
00:21:35 that we're all familiar with.
00:21:35 And of these, like the blue exorcist one is I think that's Kazue Kato or whatever.
00:21:41 I think that's who that is.
00:21:42 Like that one is a little bit close to it.
00:21:44 I mean, Slam Dunk a little bit, but Slam Dunk's always had like very kind of
00:21:47 realistic and I don't know, cool masculine art and maybe Deku a little bit.
00:21:51 But even like, like all the others have very distinct styles.
00:21:54 And like, sure, Dragon Ball has gone on to like influence a ton,
00:21:57 but it has a very different style for a lot of these birds studio.
00:22:02 Bird Studio, I mean, I was I looked at the picture of Goku expecting to see
00:22:06 Toriyama. If you scroll down a little bit,
00:22:08 you'll see a picture of the six judges and their names are Kira Toriyama.
00:22:12 Oh, cool, cool.
00:22:13 It's got to be like, but I'm saying, I don't see a Kira Toriyama.
00:22:17 It says, I scroll down and his name is there.
00:22:20 Oh, in comments from the judges or something.
00:22:22 Yeah. Oh, in the article, I see. Yeah. Yeah.
00:22:26 Oh, yeah. Well, in any case, yes, as long as it's good,
00:22:29 I mean, I can't speak to the rest of these guys necessarily,
00:22:32 but I am sure that Oda is at least open minded to appreciate all different
00:22:36 types of styles and they probably all are.
00:22:38 These guys are comic artists, right? They know what's up.
00:22:41 They've been around the block a few times.
00:22:43 So very, very exciting.
00:22:45 Yeah. So I just want to read Slam Dunk.
00:22:47 Slam Dunk looks so cool.
00:22:48 I love the art from Slam Dunk.
00:22:50 But yeah, I'm going to be doing that for the next three months.
00:22:54 I it's going to probably be very like a lot of ghosts is built off
00:23:01 of ratty fuckers cop killers.
00:23:03 You know, it has that law already going into it.
00:23:07 This is going to be a completely unique story that has to be built
00:23:11 from the ground up with characters and stuff.
00:23:13 So I'm hoping I can do that.
00:23:16 You've done it before with a canon story once or twice.
00:23:21 Yeah, you know, I look at it.
00:23:23 I could just submit that really.
00:23:24 Just submit that I'm really excited to see what you produce.
00:23:28 Do you know the like the hard deadline for like when you need to have it done
00:23:31 to turn in or whatever first of September?
00:23:34 OK, OK, shit, dog.
00:23:37 That's really exciting and I can't wait to see what you produce.
00:23:40 I mean, I'm tempted to say, maybe I should join.
00:23:43 I should submit something too.
00:23:46 But like do it. I don't know.
00:23:51 I mean, maybe if I think of something that I want to do with that, I would.
00:23:55 But if I don't, then I won't.
00:23:57 And then that's what I have to say about that.
00:24:00 Fair enough. Fair enough.
00:24:01 So, so, Ben, you've you've read the chapter now.
00:24:04 What do you think of the Lord of Ghost chapter seven?
00:24:08 What do I think of the Lord of Ghost chapter seven?
00:24:10 I think that it's the final nail in the coffin.
00:24:18 I think that it's like a personal attack or something.
00:24:22 Christ, I hate it.
00:24:23 I hate that fucking much.
00:24:26 I will end you.
00:24:29 I think I don't know.
00:24:31 I think it's based, but not very breadpilled.
00:24:34 And that's what I have to say about that.
00:24:38 There's two criteria you've got to meet.
00:24:39 And if you meet one and not the other, dead, dead.
00:24:43 Wait, I'm just clicking through the end of the end part now.
00:24:48 Lo Dan.
00:24:49 He read it fast.
00:24:50 He's just looking at the pretty pictures.
00:24:51 He doesn't know the lore.
00:24:52 He doesn't know the the pathos, the ups and downs, this fucking guy.
00:24:58 I chose the name.
00:24:59 Oh, yeah, let's just wait for Ben to finish rereading the chapter.
00:25:02 That sounds like they're discussing the name.
00:25:05 And I've got to see, OK, what else do they say about the name?
00:25:07 After I got to that part, I kind of skipped ahead.
00:25:11 OK, OK, what's the short way to say the name of the the town?
00:25:17 New, New, Biggin by the sea, aka Neo York, right?
00:25:20 Yeah, I mean, I can't think how to.
00:25:24 New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New.
00:25:30 By the sea, aka Neo York, it'll be butsakini.
00:25:38 Butsakini.
00:25:40 It's like Osaka, but different, but London, butsakini will sick.
00:25:46 There it is.
00:25:47 We'll put that in the show notes so everybody could see that.
00:25:51 Well, this is fucking based.
00:25:53 It continues.
00:25:54 It continues to be my favorite content on the Internet.
00:25:57 Hell, yeah, I can't think of anything better right now.
00:26:02 Oh, perhaps with one small check, though, it is a different sort of thing.
00:26:06 And it is. All right.
00:26:07 We guys, we got to address the big thing, the big elf in the room that we've been
00:26:12 beating our ourselves around.
00:26:15 Of course, the big beating our me too, got to stop, got to stop ignoring it.
00:26:20 We have to talk about the new Plinkett video that came out about Star Trek Picard and how it was based.
00:26:28 All right, here's my hot take.
00:26:30 I felt like this was a kind of a bad Plinkett review in so far as it doesn't contain
00:26:38 all the necessary context in order for you to really understand what's happening.
00:26:42 And I didn't really feel like I understood what the reason for it existing is, because it feels like
00:26:49 it's just sort of saying a little bit extra on top of those reviews that they did of the show.
00:26:55 I understood the context, but it's because I've been watching the reviews.
00:26:58 So I basically had all this information already.
00:27:01 Yeah, I watched the reviews as well, but like I won't go back to watch this Plinkett review
00:27:07 because I need to watch the reviews as well in order to really get it.
00:27:11 Like it doesn't stand as well on its own.
00:27:14 That's that's my point, you know, I mean, I've been following this with great interest.
00:27:20 And I've rewatched those the reviews on Plinkett like many times, because I mean, I am a huge
00:27:25 I got into Star Trek due to Red Letter Media's Plinkett reviews of the like the old movies,
00:27:31 like the next generation movies and stuff.
00:27:33 And I love those.
00:27:34 And they're basically a very similar style of content to what this is.
00:27:39 So like to me, it was kind of like a return to the classic old Plinkett from way back.
00:27:45 And, you know, maybe it's true that they like those ones do a better job of explaining the context.
00:27:50 But those weren't built on the back of like existing reviews that had already been done.
00:27:55 So perhaps it's slightly different context or whatever.
00:27:58 I also just happenstance.
00:28:01 Like I've been rewatching, re listening to all of the Plinkett reviews.
00:28:06 Star Wars Awakens, the original Phantom Menace and all that.
00:28:11 And I've noticed that there are a few that I like to rewatch.
00:28:14 And there are a few that I just they don't stand up like the Titanic one.
00:28:20 You know, it's OK, Indiana Jones.
00:28:23 That's all right.
00:28:24 The Ghostbusters one is really good.
00:28:26 That one feels like a full like it feels like it's not just here's some bad
00:28:32 media and here's me talking about why it sucks.
00:28:34 It's like a bigger thing than that, because there's a lot of stuff
00:28:40 around the Ghostbusters movie to talk about, right, right.
00:28:44 And, you know, the original the original Plinkett reviews were about
00:28:48 the prequel trilogy of Star Wars and how people don't realize that it sucks so much.
00:28:54 And he's trying to explain to everyone that George Lucas is a hack fraud.
00:28:58 And he's right.
00:28:59 There's much more to those.
00:29:00 Yeah, like it's not just bad movies.
00:29:02 It's like George Lucas was never that good, actually.
00:29:06 Empire was the one he had the least to do with creatively and all that sort of stuff.
00:29:10 Star Wars Awakens review is about the fact that Disney is a terrible company
00:29:14 and is going to ruin our lives forever, not just the Force Awakens review.
00:29:19 So like things like Baby's Day Out, the Titanic.
00:29:23 Don't hold up this Picard one.
00:29:25 I feel falls into that.
00:29:27 I'm probably not going to rewatch it that much.
00:29:30 So it's still fine, but like some of the jokes also were a bit.
00:29:34 I don't know, forced.
00:29:36 He made a poop joke once.
00:29:38 Oh, but that's classic.
00:29:40 It's classic.
00:29:40 But I feel like there wasn't enough of it to be.
00:29:46 If you know what I mean, like you just threw it in there because
00:29:48 Oh, Plinkett's supposed to say, oh, shit, joke.
00:29:50 Let's put this one.
00:29:51 Definitely, I mean, it definitely was a little more bare bones in like the
00:29:55 I would say like the Plinkett lore and the comedy.
00:29:57 It was more of a straightforward discussion of the series.
00:30:01 And then there was like some funny bits like the what was that intergalactic treaty
00:30:06 intergalactic and it's really funny.
00:30:07 I'm watching Star Trek Voyager right now.
00:30:09 It is a huge.
00:30:11 OK, I don't know the full Star Trek lore post Voyager,
00:30:15 but like this this show takes place probably a few decades after Voyager ends or whatever.
00:30:21 And but the idea of a transgalactic treaty, as mentioned in that, I mean,
00:30:26 since I'm currently experiencing Voyager for the first time, the entire conceit
00:30:29 of Voyager is that they are so far away and the galaxies divided into quadrants
00:30:35 in Star Trek for I don't know how that works, but that's how it is.
00:30:37 And they're in the Delta Quadrant and they're trying to get back to the Alpha
00:30:40 Quadrant, where like all of Star Trek took place.
00:30:43 And they are 70,000 light years away.
00:30:46 And there are various types of they call it trans warp, like like faster
00:30:50 than the hard limits beyond the faster and the speed of light that warp travel
00:30:54 gives them that would make journeys like that potentially possible.
00:30:58 But like the idea of a transgalactic treaty that there can be no like
00:31:03 synthetic life is it's just one of those things that any Star Trek person would
00:31:08 immediately be like, you're telling me that the like the Romulans and the
00:31:11 Klingons and the human, the entire Federation and the fucking Vorta and the
00:31:16 fucking Founders in the fucking Delta, that's the Gamma Quadrant of the fucking
00:31:21 Dominion, they all agreed to not make sense.
00:31:25 Very silly, very silly idea.
00:31:26 It's it's it's a it's a game of thrones.
00:31:29 It takes two minutes to sail all the way to the fucking.
00:31:33 Yes, it's very much like that.
00:31:35 Like they don't understand the scale.
00:31:36 I mean, I'm not a Star Trek person, so I don't know any of that.
00:31:39 And I don't feel like Plinkett made it like abundantly clear how ridiculous that was.
00:31:45 I don't blame you or anybody else who feels that this video was a little bit
00:31:50 like lacking in the punch or more of the Plinkett stuff they would love.
00:31:54 But for me, it's because these guys become a deep or Star Trek guy.
00:31:58 Sure, sure, that's fine.
00:31:59 But it's just that I brought the context with me because I know all these
00:32:03 characters and I've explored it over the last like the last like five years have
00:32:07 been me getting ready for this video.
00:32:10 So like I have been fully prepared watching like all these shows during that time.
00:32:15 And it was just in time to consume this.
00:32:17 So I recognize I'm in a slightly different position from from people who who have not.
00:32:21 But for me, it was a big coom after after a long time.
00:32:25 But, you know, there's another personal element that I appreciated.
00:32:28 It was that this video was made in a very fast period of time.
00:32:33 It is like a real Plinkett video.
00:32:34 You know, maybe it's not one of the best like wouldn't be rated by critics
00:32:38 throughout history is like the best.
00:32:39 OK, understandable.
00:32:41 But they made a real Plinkett video after finishing Picard
00:32:44 like a month or two ago and they got it together.
00:32:47 I thought it was pretty great in a lot of ways, really impressed.
00:32:50 And I just find that inspiring as a guy who struggles to get content out.
00:32:54 It made me feel like, you know what, Nate, maybe you don't really need to like overthink.
00:32:58 And of course, the video instantly gets a million views.
00:33:01 And it's it is like the best.
00:33:03 Even if you love the reviews of Picard, which I do, I absolutely love them.
00:33:06 And I've watched them many times.
00:33:08 This video is the best condensation of the arguments, basically.
00:33:13 And, you know, it's got extra style and pizzazz.
00:33:15 And I love the little gimmicks that they put in there.
00:33:17 I take a lot of inspiration from that personally.
00:33:19 So I will continue to suck Red Letter Media's Dick.
00:33:22 This hit really well for me personally.
00:33:23 But I get if you were to rank in some cosmic order, what are the best Plinkett reviews?
00:33:29 This probably would not be the top based on like everybody's experience of it.
00:33:33 But for me, it just hit the right spot.
00:33:35 And I really got a lot of good feels out of it.
00:33:40 You know, no.
00:33:41 Delicious Keto ice cream.
00:33:44 Can't get enough of that wonderful stuff, baby.
00:33:48 But wondering, Nate, about like your
00:33:52 your workflow, like, how's how's how's that working out for you?
00:33:56 How are you dealing with making stuff at the moment?
00:33:59 Well, I mean, since deciding to shift the way that I'm releasing content,
00:34:05 I have I know I've talked about it here and there, but just in summary,
00:34:07 I've I basically fully committed to a process
00:34:11 where both I have multiple videos in the works.
00:34:15 I have like two at least two scripts basically being worked on at any one time
00:34:19 with my editor, no need for like just doing the edits on
00:34:23 like the visual edits after I've done like the the writing and the mixing and all that stuff.
00:34:28 I sent off to him.
00:34:28 He's working on that while I'm working on a separate one.
00:34:31 And that's like a separate script that's been
00:34:34 whatever, prepared like I'm editing that with all my little autistic touches and whatnot.
00:34:39 And basically, I think that right now I'm setting myself up for
00:34:44 a much improved rate of output with higher quality videos.
00:34:48 And I am pretty close to having stuff ready to release with this like updated workflow.
00:34:52 So basically, I know it doesn't look like it right now.
00:34:54 There's been no results of this change yet.
00:34:56 I'm very keenly aware of that.
00:34:58 But I think that in the next like two to three months,
00:35:01 people will see a change in the output specifically with the way I'm doing things.
00:35:05 And I think a lot of people are going to be like, oh, shit,
00:35:07 this is like this is like classic Nate stuff and we're getting it like faster than ever.
00:35:11 We no longer need to wait like six months between videos.
00:35:14 Now I'm getting one like every month or whatever, or maybe even sooner.
00:35:18 So, you know, again, like I don't want to do that thing where I'm just talking up about,
00:35:22 oh, it's going to be so great soon, guys, just wait and see.
00:35:26 It's but I do have a lot of confidence that with the changes I've made
00:35:30 and having having another edit I'm working with.
00:35:32 And if I could get like even another editor
00:35:34 who I would also happily pay and work with and stuff,
00:35:36 then I would probably have three projects be working on at once.
00:35:39 And ultimately, I would love to get to that position as well.
00:35:42 Just have more people to work with.
00:35:44 But but for now, I'm pretty damn confident that
00:35:48 at least my patrons will be will be happy boys pretty soon with my output.
00:35:52 And really, the patrons are all that matter.
00:35:55 Yeah, there you go. That's that's my thoughts on that.
00:35:58 OK, you know, speaking of content,
00:36:01 you know, man, OK, so this is weird.
00:36:04 I was going to bring this up, but now I have a final twist to put on it.
00:36:08 I was I tweeted angrily the other day
00:36:12 about how no new episodes of Mon Ben have gotten translated recently.
00:36:18 Orisao and now Kinoman Ben, which I've talked about before.
00:36:21 I probably do I need to explain what that is again?
00:36:24 Just would you quickly?
00:36:25 Briefly, this guy, Orisao Nauke, is a mangaka
00:36:29 who has done a bunch of pretty famous manga.
00:36:32 He did 20th Century Boys and yeah, there's a couple.
00:36:36 He did Pluto that they talked about in the show,
00:36:39 but I don't think that one was is like as well known.
00:36:42 Yeah, it's it's not.
00:36:43 There's a there's a couple others.
00:36:45 I mean, he's done a lot for getting them.
00:36:46 But you know, Pluto, I read that one.
00:36:48 It's pretty good. Which one? Huh. It's about it's called Pluto.
00:36:51 It's about robots. I like that one. OK.
00:36:53 20th Century is my favorite by him.
00:36:55 And it's like there's like four seasons of the show.
00:36:58 And in every episode, he places cameras in the like work
00:37:04 station or the workplace of other mangaka films them for a week.
00:37:10 And then most of the show is like there's a there's like a narrator
00:37:15 who sort of narrates like what you're seeing, like they'll talk about
00:37:18 like the kind of pen they're using or like what goes on, what's going on.
00:37:21 They'll sort of get this narrator will like give context to the footage
00:37:27 and also give like commentary on the conversation that they have.
00:37:31 And they basically Urasawa Naoki and whichever one he's got this week,
00:37:36 they'll like sit down and sort of like have a conversation where they watch
00:37:39 the footage and like sort of talk about like, oh, you do this.
00:37:42 Oh, you do that. Like, oh, I noticed this about like, oh, that's like,
00:37:45 well, don't don't you think don't you think artists are kind of like this?
00:37:48 Like, yeah, yeah, the thing about art is that it's all about fetishism.
00:37:52 Every time I draw the male clavicle, you know, like that's the secret fetishism
00:37:56 coming out. Yes, art truly is the most the most honorable of professions.
00:38:02 Indeed.
00:38:06 Anyway, there's like there's like 16 episodes, right?
00:38:10 It's four seasons and each season is like four episodes.
00:38:13 And I think there's a pilot.
00:38:14 So there's 17 episodes.
00:38:16 But we were missing one, two, three, four, five.
00:38:20 There's like six, six episodes that I never found.
00:38:24 And they're they're not in order.
00:38:26 It's not like the last six.
00:38:27 It's like one from season two, two from season three, three from season four.
00:38:32 I can't find them anywhere.
00:38:34 There is this one guy who's uploaded the ones that exist on this daily motion
00:38:39 channel called Habanero S. And that's where I found all of them.
00:38:42 And actually, since making that tweet, I found one more.
00:38:46 I think it is season two, episode four.
00:38:49 It's one that I had not seen before.
00:38:50 So I did find a new one, but it was uploaded on another daily
00:38:54 motion channel that is named Naoki Urasawa.
00:38:58 So it might even be the guy himself uploaded this one as like a sample or something.
00:39:03 OK, so I found that other one, right?
00:39:05 But there's still five episodes that I've never seen, don't seem to exist
00:39:08 anywhere on the Internet.
00:39:09 And I'm like, God, somebody fucking dropped the ball or or there was or
00:39:14 maybe there was a copyright issue or something.
00:39:16 And but just now, as I was thinking about this, I see this tweet from
00:39:22 Echophoria, who replies to the tweet saying, I know, right?
00:39:26 The last I heard the guy doing the translator was undergoing chemo.
00:39:30 I'm afraid to say it, but he might have died.
00:39:32 Jesus Christ.
00:39:33 So that's wild.
00:39:35 I wonder I don't know how that's that's such a specific fact to know.
00:39:41 I wonder how they know that.
00:39:43 But or where they heard that from.
00:39:45 Yeah, I don't know.
00:39:46 I don't know. Maybe it's not true.
00:39:48 But in terms of how it affects me personally, it sort of doesn't matter
00:39:51 if it's true or not.
00:39:53 It seems at this point that unless somebody else steps up and does something,
00:39:58 I might never get to watch the rest of Mon Ben.
00:40:02 They have some time in time.
00:40:03 Someone someone will take.
00:40:05 I hope so.
00:40:06 Hopefully I fucking hope so.
00:40:08 They have, man, they probably they probably already translated the one
00:40:13 with the most famous people like they did.
00:40:15 Um, yeah, they did the Junji, the Junji Ito one got translated like last year.
00:40:20 And there's another one with, um, fuck, I've always forget his name,
00:40:24 but the guy who did Poon Poon.
00:40:26 Yeah, yeah, I forget his name, too.
00:40:28 They did one with the guy who did Poon Poon, Inio?
00:40:30 Inio? God, I don't know.
00:40:32 I don't remember at all.
00:40:34 And and the guy who did, I think they did one with the guy
00:40:38 who did I am a hero, the zombie one.
00:40:41 Yeah, yeah.
00:40:41 OK, I know that one.
00:40:42 And there's a couple others that I had never heard of anywhere else before,
00:40:45 but maybe they're more popular in Japan.
00:40:48 It's such a good show.
00:40:50 It's so interesting.
00:40:51 My favorite one is the guy who draws like another one I'd never heard of,
00:40:55 but he does like very like he's like totally into like just action shown and stuff.
00:41:00 Like that's all he does.
00:41:01 And he's like an older guy, but his work, like.
00:41:05 There is like this this woman,
00:41:08 the one like the first episode that's other than the pilot is about this woman.
00:41:11 And she is like incredibly prolific.
00:41:13 She pumps out like a new like 30 page chapter like every week.
00:41:17 Sometimes she does it on like multiple stories, running concurrently.
00:41:20 And she's got like a huge team.
00:41:22 She's got like eight assistants.
00:41:23 They all work in this little office and they're all like
00:41:25 they're all like running around with like folders and like like like pens and pencils
00:41:30 and like just doing little like jobs and stuff.
00:41:32 And it's kind of it's it's it's pretty assembly line.
00:41:35 And that but that's cool.
00:41:37 But then there's this other guy, this the shonen guy, his workspace.
00:41:42 He just it's just him and three assistants just sitting at a table
00:41:46 and they play like heavy metal music all the whole time.
00:41:50 And like the rule is like no silence.
00:41:52 Like we've got it like we're like the atmosphere has got to be like upbeat.
00:41:55 We got to be like cracking jokes the whole time.
00:41:57 Just like having a good fucking time while we do this.
00:42:01 And they're just like passing pages around.
00:42:03 And like that's he's my he's my favorite.
00:42:05 He's my favorite dude.
00:42:07 That's cool.
00:42:08 What a great fucking program.
00:42:10 And what a shame if I don't get to see the other five episodes.
00:42:15 That is a fascinating idea.
00:42:17 Yeah, I should watch the show.
00:42:18 I'm just remembering that when Munchie came to London as depicted
00:42:24 in Lord of Ghost Comic, but also in real life.
00:42:26 Spoilers, dude. Spoilers, spoilers.
00:42:29 Spoilers, dude.
00:42:30 When when Munchie came to London, we went to I think it was the British Museum.
00:42:37 Something there was a a manga exhibit
00:42:41 and you go in and there's a bunch of like original pages.
00:42:46 Like we we saw the the page in one piece
00:42:50 where Luffy remembers that he has friends after the the Marion Ford War and all that.
00:42:55 Ah, yes, like that actual page.
00:42:57 I could see how he shaded in the the hair.
00:42:59 I was like, whoa, it's right.
00:43:00 It's just right there. Hell yeah.
00:43:02 Um, lots of cool stuff.
00:43:04 And then also on a TV was Man Ben and it was subtitled.
00:43:09 And I'm like, wait, is there an official subtitled version of this?
00:43:14 It was just on a it was just on a loop on it on a on a on a on a TV
00:43:19 and a little thing next to it saying Man Ben is a show where it goes around to
00:43:23 manga authors. I was like, oh, I know that from Ben St.
00:43:26 Huh. That's you know, I also got the impression that there was an official
00:43:33 subbed version because I saw like the one on the channel called Urasaki
00:43:38 Naoki. I might have say the name wrong.
00:43:42 Naoki, that's right.
00:43:43 Yeah, Naoki, the one on his channel, it's subbed in the exact same way as the
00:43:50 I want to know where this Echoforia person gets their information
00:43:54 because my, yeah, my impression that these were official subs
00:43:58 that had just not been released due to some kind of copyright issue
00:44:01 because there is a website, Naoki.
00:44:07 There, there is a Naoki Urasawa dot com, which you would think is his official
00:44:12 site, but it's not. It says, I'm not Naoki Urasawa.
00:44:16 I'm just a supporter of his work.
00:44:18 On this site, you'll find English subtitled versions of Urasawa, Naoki,
00:44:21 Noman, Ben, the interview series created by himself, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:44:26 I didn't actually read this, but I should probably.
00:44:30 OK, OK, so he and he has a bunch of episodes posted, but then he updates
00:44:36 on January of last year.
00:44:38 He says NHK flagged his videos for copyright and his YouTube account
00:44:41 got taken down, which I did see and then, but like the videos are still
00:44:48 listed on the web.
00:44:51 There are some of the videos are still listed, but they don't seem to be listed
00:44:54 on YouTube. And when you click them, they don't see not available.
00:44:56 They say publishing in progress, which I've never seen before.
00:45:02 That is strange.
00:45:03 And other ones of them say video on available as though it's a YouTube thing.
00:45:08 That publishing a process might be that thing where with YouTube, if you set it
00:45:12 to automatically be public, but like it goes through a process of first
00:45:16 it uploads and then it processes.
00:45:18 So maybe the video is technically available publicly, but it maybe it's
00:45:21 stuck in that limbo due to copyright.
00:45:23 You'd think it would just finish processing and then say blocked on
00:45:26 copyright grounds or whatever.
00:45:27 I mean, the fact that I have never seen this message on any YouTube video
00:45:31 makes me think that it's not that.
00:45:33 Yeah, you might be right.
00:45:35 But I don't know what it is.
00:45:37 Anyway, anyway, the point is that my impression was that these were
00:45:40 officially subtitled episodes that were just being distributed, you know,
00:45:44 underground and that had been like claimed by the copyright holder.
00:45:48 You should ask that.
00:45:49 But maybe if I went information, but maybe if I went and I watched the end of
00:45:53 like, if I actually looked at the subtitles, you know how the subbers will
00:45:56 like include their like subber credits?
00:45:58 Yeah, yeah, right.
00:45:59 I could probably find out if I just watched and paid attention.
00:46:02 That's a good idea.
00:46:03 That's a good idea.
00:46:03 Yeah.
00:46:05 And then maybe I could go look them up and find their blog where they say,
00:46:07 hey, guys, I'm undergoing chemo and I might die.
00:46:09 And then the blog goes silent.
00:46:11 I go, oh, that would be.
00:46:15 Interesting information.
00:46:17 Yeah, that'd be.
00:46:19 Yeah, totally.
00:46:22 Oh, no, please.
00:46:27 All right, well, that's that's all well and good.
00:46:29 Let's see what happened with that.
00:46:30 But seriously, we're glad to that guy.
00:46:32 Maybe there's he could probably just hook you up.
00:46:34 Is is my maybe if he has information,
00:46:36 unless he's just talking Abel Salute out of his ass, doesn't know where he's
00:46:40 getting all I was just asking, like, where did you get this information?
00:46:48 Gonna need a link, bro.
00:46:49 Gonna need a source fam.
00:46:52 Yeah, yeah, yeah, fuck you.
00:46:54 Yeah, fuck you.
00:46:54 Indeed.
00:46:56 Oof, hmm.
00:46:58 Well, should we talk about Digi?
00:47:01 That's, you know, that's the thing.
00:47:03 I mean, I was asking about she's a woman now.
00:47:05 Well, there's not much to say.
00:47:06 There's definitely not that much to say.
00:47:08 You would think there'd be more to say.
00:47:09 But I mean, yeah, I can acknowledge it.
00:47:14 I mean, OK, I guess I will say that.
00:47:15 I thought it was a joke.
00:47:17 Digi also seems that she phrases a joke.
00:47:21 No doubt at first.
00:47:22 She needed to clarify that no, actually, I know it sounded like a joke
00:47:25 when I said it the first time, but no, this is serious.
00:47:29 And I asked her in the discord, I said, hey, is this real?
00:47:32 Or is this like a ruse?
00:47:34 And she said, no, this is real.
00:47:36 And I said, all right, well, I will match your level of dedicate.
00:47:42 I will take it as seriously as you do.
00:47:45 So if you're serious about it, then OK, fair enough.
00:47:48 And that seems to be the case.
00:47:51 And she thought I was saying like she said like, oh, you know,
00:47:56 I will say funny, funny, funny.
00:47:59 This is before that she made the posts about it,
00:48:07 being a girl or whatever.
00:48:09 I had post, wait, no, I can't say it.
00:48:12 It's a spoiler.
00:48:13 Spoiler, OK.
00:48:15 You know what I'm talking about.
00:48:16 Oh, I do know what you're talking about.
00:48:18 Yeah, is that a spoiler?
00:48:21 I'm going to say yes.
00:48:22 I'm going to say yes.
00:48:23 We've got to keep that in mind.
00:48:24 No particular reason.
00:48:26 I posted a female character in the discord
00:48:32 that was based on myself for some reason.
00:48:36 Shut up.
00:48:37 And I was like.
00:48:39 Oh, you cut all that.
00:48:40 Cut all this.
00:48:40 Don't cut all that.
00:48:41 Don't cut all that.
00:48:42 It needs content.
00:48:42 It's fine.
00:48:43 It's fine.
00:48:43 Look, don't worry about it.
00:48:44 And a 10 of viewers will be rewarded with nuggets of information
00:48:49 that they can piece together bits of the puzzle.
00:48:53 And I posted that.
00:48:55 And Digi was like, is this your trans sona?
00:48:57 And I was like, lol, no.
00:49:01 I mean, I thought it was a joke.
00:49:03 But no.
00:49:05 And then later, she said, oh, OK, no.
00:49:07 I actually thought this was a legit trans sona.
00:49:09 I didn't realize what it was actually for.
00:49:11 And I was like, lol, what a silly mistake to make.
00:49:15 And then when I said, OK, I will match your level of dedication
00:49:21 to this.
00:49:22 And Digi said, oh, you mean you're
00:49:25 going to be dedicated to being feminine?
00:49:27 And I was like, no, no.
00:49:29 I mean, to you being feminine.
00:49:30 It's spreading like a virus, boys and girls.
00:49:32 What they tell you is all true.
00:49:34 Digi just now, Digi has the trans agenda.
00:49:37 And she wants to spread it.
00:49:39 And she wants to spread it and propagate it.
00:49:40 She wants to sink her claws into me and turn her,
00:49:43 turn me into a genus.
00:49:43 All I see.
00:49:45 As well.
00:49:45 I turn my gaze out.
00:49:46 All I see is eggs.
00:49:48 For the fate of the white race, we must resist.
00:49:51 All I see is heroic trans individuals and eggs.
00:49:54 And except, of course, in over 30-year-old women.
00:49:57 Now they have no eggs at all, of course.
00:49:59 Yes.
00:50:00 It's just science, guys.
00:50:01 But yeah.
00:50:02 Delicious, delicious eggs.
00:50:06 So that's my story.
00:50:09 That's my struggle with Digi coming out as trans.
00:50:12 This is how this has affected me.
00:50:15 And I will persevere.
00:50:17 And if you want to support me in my endeavors,
00:50:21 in spite of all the hardship I face,
00:50:23 patreon.com.com.
00:50:23 Slash, Ben Sains, to help me get through this trying time.
00:50:32 Thanks very much.
00:50:34 It's kind of funny.
00:50:36 There isn't really much to say about it.
00:50:38 It's just sort of like, oh, cool.
00:50:40 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:50:41 But there were a lot of people.
00:50:42 I was curious why so many people said, oh,
00:50:47 I've seen this coming for a million years.
00:50:49 This is bound to happen eventually.
00:50:51 Lol, I saw it coming.
00:50:53 And I'm like, I didn't.
00:50:54 Do I not know Digi well enough?
00:50:56 Am I stupid?
00:50:57 Did I not pick up on all these things that they say?
00:51:00 Don't you remember all the times
00:51:01 that Digi talked about wanting to be a little girl?
00:51:04 I just thought that was an anime thing.
00:51:06 I just thought that was a hymn thing.
00:51:07 I mean, it could be.
00:51:09 It could be.
00:51:10 But I heard people say Digi is an egg.
00:51:13 And I thought, I guess I could see it.
00:51:16 And now it was true.
00:51:17 And I'm like, yeah, not a huge shock, I guess.
00:51:22 Yeah, I'm not too shocked.
00:51:24 It's just like I'm a little confused
00:51:26 as why I couldn't see the signs or what.
00:51:30 I don't know.
00:51:31 I mean, visibly outwardly, Digi's always
00:51:34 presented pretty male.
00:51:36 Or that seems to have been due to sheer laziness, which
00:51:40 hey, we all do, right?
00:51:42 The biology there is male.
00:51:43 Got a beard and whatnot.
00:51:43 What can you do?
00:51:44 So I mean, who can say what's going on in a person's head?
00:51:47 So I don't know.
00:51:48 Yeah, not that surprising.
00:51:51 I mean, she said, you say, a person says,
00:51:56 I want to be a girl a whole bunch of times.
00:51:58 Like what?
00:52:00 Like, you know.
00:52:00 Yeah, but who doesn't?
00:52:01 I mean, Digi personally has been like
00:52:03 confused specifically.
00:52:05 I mean, you know.
00:52:07 What man has not wondered what it would be
00:52:09 like to be the other sex for just at least a day?
00:52:12 I guess.
00:52:14 Indeed, indeed.
00:52:15 Nate, I missed what you said.
00:52:18 I don't know.
00:52:19 Nothing important.
00:52:20 I mean, Digi has constantly expressed confusion.
00:52:21 So I mean, I don't think it's crazy to be like,
00:52:23 okay, who knows exactly how this will pan out?
00:52:26 Again, it seems like a pretty reasonable way to turn out,
00:52:28 but yeah, that's it.
00:52:31 Anyway, anyway, all this is to say
00:52:34 that she's kicked off the podcast.
00:52:36 Yeah, she's.
00:52:37 That's correct.
00:52:38 Okay, now.
00:52:38 And we kind of buy that.
00:52:40 Looking forward to the makeup tutorials and the,
00:52:44 you know, the, what is it?
00:52:45 Well, where do girls shop?
00:52:48 Girl, clothing, hall,
00:52:50 girl, store.
00:52:51 Women be shopping.
00:52:53 They be shopping, man.
00:52:54 And it's disgusting.
00:52:56 Yeah.
00:52:57 Prepare to receive the white hot lens of my misogyny.
00:53:01 And it's going to come in hot and hard.
00:53:04 So be prepared.
00:53:06 Okay.
00:53:07 But like women, am I right?
00:53:11 What's going to be really embarrassing is that,
00:53:13 you know, when we have Raek on five
00:53:15 and we do our customary like gay orgy,
00:53:17 it's not going to be gay anymore.
00:53:18 There's going to be a woman there.
00:53:19 Oh, gross.
00:53:20 Well, now it's not funny.
00:53:22 No, canceled.
00:53:24 Well, hey, Digi did say that Fuda was the preferred
00:53:28 identity of choice.
00:53:29 So Fuda is somewhere on the gay spectrum, right?
00:53:32 Um.
00:53:36 I'm going to go with a yeah.
00:53:38 Oh, wait.
00:53:39 I mean, I don't know.
00:53:41 Hotly debated, I guess.
00:53:42 It is debated.
00:53:43 It is debated.
00:53:44 One day the scholars will inform us,
00:53:46 but we'll just have to wonder until then.
00:53:48 Well, I mean, there you go.
00:53:49 You jackals.
00:53:50 There's your hot takes on the trans question.
00:53:54 Asked and answered.
00:53:57 We saw it.
00:53:57 How much you say?
00:53:58 We sorted it.
00:54:00 Yep.
00:54:01 Settled the issue.
00:54:04 I mean, hey, that's all I got.
00:54:05 I got voice mails.
00:54:06 Surely something else.
00:54:08 Surely something else must have happened
00:54:09 in my life this week.
00:54:12 Oh, wait.
00:54:13 You're saying something?
00:54:13 It's quarantine.
00:54:14 I was just going to say that I've been rereading Berserk.
00:54:20 Yeah, from the start.
00:54:21 Yeah.
00:54:22 Well, I rewatched the anime,
00:54:25 or rather I watched the anime all the way through
00:54:27 for the first time.
00:54:28 I was like, oh my God, I love this.
00:54:30 It's probably one of my top 10 anime favorites.
00:54:33 It is really good.
00:54:34 It is just exactly what I like in a show.
00:54:37 It's slow and it's epic and it's quiet.
00:54:41 Have you watched the famous bloopers
00:54:47 that are attached to the Berserk anime
00:54:49 and the English dub?
00:54:50 They are the stuff of legend.
00:54:52 Like I have not heard that.
00:54:54 I will acquire for you the link.
00:54:57 The Berserk anime is famous for its blooper reel
00:55:01 or whatever that are wrong takes done to it
00:55:04 and you should definitely check it out.
00:55:06 Berserk anime bloopers.
00:55:09 Cool.
00:55:10 It's like 10 minutes long.
00:55:12 Or no, it's like 40 minutes long.
00:55:13 Jesus Christ.
00:55:14 Okay, here we go.
00:55:16 But yeah, I watched the anime and I was like,
00:55:20 okay, let's read the manga from this point.
00:55:24 Because I've read all the manga all the way anyway.
00:55:26 So I'm rereading it and I'm like, dang,
00:55:28 this is just like, this is so good.
00:55:32 This is how many pen lines is that?
00:55:34 That's like one million little pen lines on that drawing.
00:55:37 How does he do that?
00:55:38 How does his hand not fall off?
00:55:41 I'm just being enamored.
00:55:43 I think it's that one image
00:55:48 in the latest Lord of Ghost chapter
00:55:50 with this lot of shading, a lot of cross-hatching.
00:55:53 That was because I was looking at the part in Berserk
00:55:56 where it's in the holy place with the tower.
00:56:05 With the priest and the, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:56:07 Yeah, and it was, it's like night is falling
00:56:10 and all of the big scary gloop monsters
00:56:12 are sucking up everyone and climbing the tower
00:56:14 and forming a giant hand.
00:56:16 It's just like that.
00:56:17 It's like so fucking visceral,
00:56:20 so fucking well-drawn, every fucking frame, a painting.
00:56:25 I love Berserk.
00:56:27 It's so much of an inspiration to me.
00:56:29 I think about it constantly now.
00:56:32 I'm just, I just, if there could be anything
00:56:35 I could do in my life, it would be to draw Berserk.
00:56:39 That's plus one to the list of the things I just want to do.
00:56:42 I want to draw one piece, draw Berserk and draw Homestuck.
00:56:45 Any thoughts?
00:56:47 Oh yeah, go on Ben, go on.
00:56:48 Well, I was going to say,
00:56:50 I also revisited a classic work of massive cultural import
00:56:57 and breathtaking, stunning quality and craftsmanship.
00:57:02 I'm talking, of course, about the entire angry video game,
00:57:05 nerd, videography, I like played the entire fucking series.
00:57:14 I just put on the playlist and let it go
00:57:16 for like a whole week.
00:57:17 Did you listen to the series videos like hours long?
00:57:24 Yeah, yeah, the ones that are the entire series
00:57:26 put together in one video, right?
00:57:27 Yeah, those are great.
00:57:29 Yep, I just, that's what I've been sort of like having on
00:57:33 for like the past, however many days or whatever.
00:57:36 It's so easy to just do all of them when you start,
00:57:38 but like watching many of them.
00:57:40 Like, it is, it's like, they just kind of,
00:57:45 it doesn't really feel like one ends
00:57:46 and a new one begins a lot of the time.
00:57:50 Really?
00:57:51 Sometimes it does, other times it doesn't.
00:57:53 Yeah, a lot of the endings are like really abrupt
00:57:56 and don't really like, I think a lot of the time
00:58:00 he just ends an episode with like taking a dump on the game
00:58:03 and then the next episode just ends with him
00:58:05 like talking about, so this game is a piece of shit
00:58:09 and it feels, and it makes me feel like a piece of donkey
00:58:13 doodoo hurled out of a grizzly bear's vagina.
00:58:17 And what were they thinking?
00:58:22 What were they thinking?
00:58:24 That's a good one.
00:58:25 I don't know, but you should have that as one of your sounds.
00:58:29 I'm adding it to my note,
00:58:31 the what were they thinking anime video?
00:58:32 What were they thinking?
00:58:34 I've been saying that.
00:58:35 The anime video game nerd, that's gonna be me, yes.
00:58:39 The anime video game nerd, that's pretty good.
00:58:41 That's right, Konnichiwa, fucku-faisu, fucku this game.
00:58:46 Sakuwe fucku of Shinobi Dick.
00:58:49 If he's the anime video game nerd,
00:58:52 he's not gonna be angry, he's gonna be anime.
00:58:55 Yeah, he's just a video game nerd who has-
00:58:58 He's just a nerd who is an anime anime.
00:59:00 If only I had this much sound, but I'd play it.
00:59:02 Well, okay, this one works.
00:59:04 When he's angry instead of screaming
00:59:05 or when he's playing a video game, instead he goes,
00:59:08 Yeah, you give us one of those, you know?
00:59:11 Yeah.
00:59:12 We'd also do that, doke doke, yo!
00:59:15 You know that one.
00:59:15 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:59:17 The one that- That's a classic.
00:59:18 The one that you hear at the beginning
00:59:20 of the pastel defender heliotrope game.
00:59:25 And you hear at the beginning of Jiraiyo's theme
00:59:28 and the Naruto artist theme.
00:59:30 I don't care about that.
00:59:31 Watch my fucking J.D. Jennifer Dayan Wright's lecture
00:59:35 and at the beginning, there's the game interlude
00:59:37 where you see the video game that has a yo-hoo, whatever.
00:59:43 Yo-hoo!
00:59:44 It's a kabuki thing.
00:59:46 Little kabuki theater fucking sound effects
00:59:50 and she mixed with like pinball video game noises.
00:59:53 Legendary, aesthetic experience.
00:59:58 Bass.
00:59:59 I should add that.
01:00:00 It's so fucking good.
01:00:00 You should add that, that's a good one.
01:00:03 You should add the entirety of Berserk to your soundboard.
01:00:06 That's a good idea.
01:00:07 Auto play.
01:00:09 I have, I did remember one more thing that happened to me.
01:00:14 More thing that happened to me this week.
01:00:15 I ordered more, remember how I was making gummy worms?
01:00:18 Of course, of course.
01:00:19 But then I ran out of that syrup
01:00:21 and the distributatively weren't selling it anymore
01:00:25 for mysterious reasons.
01:00:26 Right, right.
01:00:27 Well, I have good and bad news.
01:00:29 I ordered the powdered form of it, not the syrup form.
01:00:33 That's the good news, I got the stuff again.
01:00:36 The kind of bad news is I was like,
01:00:38 what is the relation of this syrup to the powder?
01:00:41 Is the syrup just the powder dissolved in water?
01:00:43 I don't know.
01:00:44 So I tried just mixing it in water and it kind of worked?
01:00:49 Like it did mix and it did give the gummies like more of that.
01:00:54 I think maybe I put too much in because like,
01:00:58 I don't know, there might be a balance to be struck here
01:01:00 because I tried using this stuff.
01:01:02 It did give them more of a gummi-ish texture.
01:01:04 It gave them too much of a gummi-ish texture.
01:01:06 They were like very sticky
01:01:08 and they didn't hold together very well.
01:01:10 And also, but also it didn't mix perfectly.
01:01:13 And there were sort of like kind of like the bottoms of them
01:01:16 were kind of a little bit hard and chewy.
01:01:18 And sometimes there were even like kind of lumps in them
01:01:21 that you couldn't even really chew at all.
01:01:22 And it was a little unpleasant.
01:01:24 So there's work to do.
01:01:25 There's work to do on getting it right with this powdered form.
01:01:29 But we'll get there.
01:01:32 We'll get there boys.
01:01:33 And one day maybe we'll return to the Promised Land.
01:01:36 That sweet, sweet tapioca-soluble fiber syrup
01:01:40 once it returns to the internet wave stores.
01:01:45 And that will be-
01:01:46 I'm looking forward to it.
01:01:47 I'm looking forward to it.
01:01:49 Was that it?
01:01:51 There we go.
01:01:57 Classic.
01:01:59 Base.
01:02:00 I love Japan period.
01:02:03 Well hey, I guess for voicemails
01:02:08 because I've said all I have to say.
01:02:10 I'm ready.
01:02:11 I'm ready to go.
01:02:12 All right let's do it.
01:02:13 Let me see here.
01:02:15 Where did I put them?
01:02:17 Oh the chocobay.
01:02:18 Oh that's not a voicemail.
01:02:20 that's the Joker baby easy to confuse let me say okay here we go here we go
01:02:26 my favorite part of the Joker movie is when Joaquin Phoenix turns to look
01:02:30 directly into the camera and says now I have become the Joker hmm now we did it
01:02:40 Batman now we finally became this face now this face is the mask the makeup is
01:02:45 my true self I don't I actually haven't seen it he might very well say that I
01:02:57 haven't seen it I meant to see it but I never got around to it I don't watch
01:03:07 any movie base animal I'm a Philistine what are you I have a movie I think I'm I
01:03:13 think it's like a depression thing where I like don't appreciate art anymore of
01:03:17 any kind the thought of it sickens me except the Lord of Ghosts the only thing
01:03:25 that doesn't make me feel that way speaking of saturation due to an
01:03:30 overabundance of media if that's not what I was not what I was talking about
01:03:34 alright but depression at least partially induced by hating the universe in
01:03:39 the world and being sad its existence that yeah her to me but before we
01:03:43 discuss that listen to this voicemail called where I put it this is a reverse
01:03:48 nostalgia okay take it away go I had a really strange experience recently so I
01:03:54 like had not played Animal Crossing at all prior to New Horizons coming out and
01:04:00 like I'd played Smash Bros you know and there's like Animal Crossing characters
01:04:05 and stages and music and stuff in there and all of it was just kind of like okay
01:04:09 yeah whatever that's neat to me you like you know it was it was just like okay
01:04:14 it's a game I don't really play but I mean it doesn't it doesn't it's like
01:04:18 whatever but now after having played Animal Crossing New Horizons I get like
01:04:24 almost all of the references and stuff and it like feels so invigorating like
01:04:29 playing Smash Bros again just like to know all the Animal Crossing shit and
01:04:35 like I know that I want to do that for more games now like I haven't played
01:04:39 every single game on the Smash Bros roster but that this experience has made
01:04:44 me want to play more of them just to like get that feeling because like I
01:04:48 would like get all of the like I don't know Mega Man stuff or whatever like
01:04:52 Mario you know yeah because I had played those games and it's like oh yeah
01:04:56 that's like the level from the whatever the character but like there's some that
01:05:01 I just don't even fucking know man like it's crazy I don't even know how to
01:05:05 describe this feeling it's like reverse nostalgia there it is title drop what
01:05:11 it's cool is that I saw it and I clapped that's what you're feeling I know
01:05:18 exactly how it feels I feel the same I played Earthbound long after Smash and
01:05:22 then I was like oh shit I want to go check that out I don't know if I feel the
01:05:26 same way because like a lot of the time like like in um fuck the city the
01:05:33 earthbound city that's it's it's Eagleton right or Eagletown I think it's
01:05:37 on that no no on it Eagland is the name of the country on it is the town you
01:05:42 know you see on it in Smash Bros and it's like all 3d and there's all this
01:05:47 stuff happening you play earthbound and on it is like it's just like some it's
01:05:52 just like some pixelated houses it's like it's like it's not much more than
01:05:55 like a Pokemon town oh yeah yeah but it's fun to when I things are interpreted
01:06:01 I guess but I feel like I would feel the same way about like a Mega Man level or
01:06:05 something or whatever I think what a lot of my experience with this kind of thing
01:06:11 is a lot of the times I'll see something reference as like an important
01:06:14 video game history thing yeah or whatever and then it in the unlikely
01:06:20 chance that I do go back and you know play the thing watch the thing whatever
01:06:26 and get that context a lot of the time my thought is like oh like that's all
01:06:33 it was back then like because it was because a lot of the time if it's
01:06:36 something that's like became famous it at the time was just like a pretty humble
01:06:40 thing that maybe didn't even call much attention to itself you know what I mean
01:06:45 yeah that's true like the town of on it was not like this landmark thing it
01:06:50 wasn't like the game wasn't about it it wasn't fleshed out that much but I guess
01:06:54 just because it was the thing in the game that was such a hit it you know got
01:06:58 recognition and became sort of sort of famous in its own right and then
01:07:02 especially so when they put it in a smith because I needed a setting from the
01:07:06 game what's the setting for Earthbound first one to come to mind on it I guess
01:07:10 okay we'll go with that all right now it's a famous video game location as long
01:07:14 as people don't have some like weird expectation I guess they should like you
01:07:18 should know like okay this game was made like 19 what like 89 I don't know like
01:07:22 like super NES way back in the day you should just keep that in mind you're
01:07:27 like okay like it's not gonna be it's not gonna like blow my mind but then there's
01:07:30 a lot I mean there's a reason people love that game I played it like way later in
01:07:33 life and I absolutely loved it even as like a kid either as like playing game
01:07:38 well earthbound is we're not talking about that's just an example the only
01:07:42 thing I know about earthbound is that it gets really really fucked up and that
01:07:48 there isn't a really fucked up earthbound stage like why is that is it
01:07:52 doesn't it get into like psychic horror almost well there is the the big city
01:07:56 from mother three in in brawl that was put in there and that has like the
01:08:00 chimera which is a big fucking monster I mean they could have done nightside but
01:08:04 like nightside is like a weird version of like what is it forson that city or
01:08:08 whatever I can't remember exactly we're like four cent garbage the one the one
01:08:12 where like yes is no and no is yes yeah yeah that would have been I mean they
01:08:17 only have so many stages and it just reverses all your controls or whatever
01:08:22 yeah fuck you player you just have to you have to ask the smash staz to why
01:08:26 they thought some made for better stages than others but but this question was
01:08:30 not about earthbound I was just using this no no right right we just fine I
01:08:34 mean I totally know what this guy I mean when to city I was coming out the city of
01:08:38 Final Fantasy in like 2008 that along with my longtime fandom of Final Fantasy
01:08:43 I was like okay fuck this I need to now go play like all the final fantasies that
01:08:46 I've missed and then I went back and I think I played like three and I think I
01:08:50 played four and like the I don't know if the sequel to four was out then I'd
01:08:53 already played like five and six I think I think I played like I tried to beat a
01:08:57 but didn't finish here something I don't I played like a bunch because I wanted
01:09:01 like oh yeah like I don't know who the fuck onion knight is I want to know what
01:09:04 onion nights about so I'm gonna go play Final Fantasy 3 turns out like there is
01:09:08 nothing to onion night that's just the default class and it is good and cool
01:09:12 but I mean a better thing is that like in the original dissidia and they fucking
01:09:15 changes for the sequel which is stupid the Bartz's ultimate attack like cloud
01:09:20 has omni slash okay big iconic of course that's ultimate attack Bartz's is
01:09:25 rapid-fire dual-wheeled spellblade which is just a really efficient and strong
01:09:32 combination of powers from Final Fantasy 5 it's like literally called that
01:09:37 which is just like a meta thing that like the community was aware of and it
01:09:41 became like his quote-unquote ultimate attack which is pretty pretty based
01:09:45 pretty cool so I don't know it like and it's fun to just go back and like learn
01:09:49 how such things came to be such that whatever that that's not like really a
01:09:55 cultural touchstone this particular combination of attacks but I mean in the
01:09:59 community it is I don't know whatever I certainly get where this guy's coming
01:10:03 from oh there was another thing I want to say about this guy so that voice is
01:10:07 probably familiar to you ladies and gentlemen because this guy leaves a lot
01:10:11 of voicemails I don't know if he has like a handle or a name I just want to
01:10:14 say for the record this man this this creature left like 16 voicemails this
01:10:21 week and I got to 16 and I'm letting you know I tweeted about this before I just
01:10:28 stopped listening after like I would listen to like 10 seconds oh it's this
01:10:33 guy again don't leave you there's stop don't do that I don't have time to listen
01:10:39 to 16 voicemails from the same person cut it down cut it down is that the same guy
01:10:46 that just did this one yeah that guy I mean this question was fine it was the
01:10:50 first one I heard but then he just went on to do more and more and more and like
01:10:54 some were fine but I just got absolutely bored I was like I'm no I'm not
01:10:58 gonna like they were not like amazing ones each one they were just like hey

01:14:10 what's the big hey did I talk about the history of cheese making memes I don't
01:14:17 think so all right let me just let me just break in here to tell you about the
01:14:20 funniest thing that happened to me this week sure and sad to say it was just a
01:14:26 meme that I found on the internet okay I was kind of drunk but I saw this meme I
01:14:31 saw a tweet that said all I can do now is make history of cheese making memes and
01:14:37 there were a couple of memes but let's tell you the best one it was you know
01:14:42 the one of the anime guy who's gesturing at a butterfly and he says is this
01:14:45 something right of course well this one was the guy was a human being in
01:14:53 Mesopotamia circa 5,000 to 7,000 BC he's gesturing at the butterfly the butterfly
01:14:59 is a goat's bladder can a sheep's bladder containing rennet an enzyme that
01:15:04 promotes curdling is this a good place to store milk
01:15:13 that's it's well I was like that's good out of breath
01:15:23 there were a couple other I guess I guess I guess that no no no no you see
01:15:29 there was another meme attached you see he would think no the answer was no but
01:15:32 then there was other me with it's sort of like the Drake reaction but it's like a
01:15:36 girl and the first she's going like but the second she's going hmm and the first
01:15:41 is like opening up my sheep's bladder to find that the milk I stored in it has
01:15:45 curdled and then the second one is realizing I've just invented cheese
01:15:52 the thing about being the thing about being a human in Mesopotamia circa 5,000
01:15:59 to 7,000 BC is that you would never ever go anywhere without your trusty
01:16:04 sheep's bladder you're always looking for places to store all this milk like what's
01:16:13 the point of doing like it's like no no no the first guy who put who put milk in
01:16:17 there in their rennet rich sheeps bladder it was like the guy who first put
01:16:21 peanut butter on chocolate
01:16:29 my question is how do you get the cheese out do you have to squeeze is it still
01:16:32 liquidy I guess it is yeah yeah okay okay fair enough I was wondering if you
01:16:39 have to lose a perfectly good bladder for such things there was a third meme I
01:16:42 don't know it was also about rennet what I don't give a fuck you get the point
01:16:46 more rennet try to link those if you can find a band for adoring you know I'm
01:16:50 sure it won't be hard for me to find okay okay all right let's move on to our
01:16:55 next voicemail yes of course Caligula is calling in he apparently has something
01:17:00 to say take it away see dog hey guys last episode y'all talked about melee and
01:17:05 there's a lot of misinformation I'm a melee player I'm super in on the scene I
01:17:10 want to give some things oh cool one melee is not like super big we get really
01:17:15 good viewer numbers but we're not a very large community we don't have the
01:17:18 biggest numbers especially evo ultimate pulls like double almost triple the
01:17:22 amount of entrance we do but the real reason melee was kicked last year is
01:17:27 because with ultimate coming out you know 2019 didn't want to have two smash
01:17:32 games for like the fifth year in a row they only have nine spots for so many
01:17:36 fighting games and they're really important they're already doing it and
01:17:38 melee does use CRTs which are harder to get especially now in 2020
01:17:43 archaic tech so mr. wizard the evo owner kicked us and most people think it is
01:17:51 not just because of those reasons but also he doesn't really like melee he's
01:17:55 insulted the game a lot we only got enough like a donation drive in 2013 and
01:18:00 we just were big enough he had to keep us around on pressure but yeah it really
01:18:04 wasn't any reasons a Nintendo or anything like that it was really just no
01:18:09 two smash games CRTs are kind of annoying and mr. wizard really does not
01:18:14 like melee okay that was just an ad no it wasn't an ad that was just a response
01:18:23 to our discussion about melee it was just giving us an inside scoop it was an
01:18:27 um actually but that's fine you know I guess it kind of was an um actually I
01:18:32 guess that's fair to be honest I was gonna make a comment sorry voice voice
01:18:40 jail it bored me voice oh no come on okay damn it you got one voice bail per
01:18:50 episode if you're on the episode all right okay well let's see if this one
01:18:54 rises to your lofty standards this is let me see Shawn recommends the PAP oh
01:19:01 yeah okay okay let's let's give Shawn here a opportunity are you tired of the
01:19:07 same old PCP you know it like derivative content do you absolutely like to dab
01:19:14 on the Jews do you want to hear what Australia is let off my brow do you want
01:19:21 to hear what a real Ben St. fan has to say do you want to hear a really good
01:19:27 shaggy impression well if you answered yes to any one of those might I recommend
01:19:33 the procrastinators anonymous podcast which I the voicemail God will be on
01:19:40 the next episode wow I'm tuning in by the way this one I have a feeling like the
01:19:47 teen see you know oh that sting oh what who was leading the teen CP I think was
01:19:54 just called teens with a teen CP yeah his teen CP is just shrinking right
01:19:59 becoming more teensy by the second he's become fully RFCK pill he doesn't care
01:20:04 about the PCP anymore yeah face dab well fair enough well there you go there
01:20:11 you go though the floor is yours procrastinators anonymous podcast I've
01:20:16 listened to episodes I thought they were pretty interesting I just I mean mostly
01:20:19 I know that their icon on Twitter is a very unflattering photo edit of me oh
01:20:26 that's right it is very I really cringe every time I look at it but I mean that's
01:20:32 some that's a me problem other people might feel differently mm-hmm there's at
01:20:37 least one you got you got Simon on there he's the hardcore Ben had so he's there
01:20:41 going to bat I didn't know I know I like listening to it because sometimes they
01:20:47 talk about me and that's all I care about is me I guess I guess I sure hope
01:20:51 they are the primary audience I guess I should probably give it a listen I mean
01:20:55 I am I guess they're mascot so I yeah um you could descend from the clouds do
01:21:02 dude to visit them dune Coon is on it right I believe doing Coon is the is the
01:21:06 general organizer if I if I understand correctly he's the one who I most well
01:21:10 dude you're doing a great job on the procrastinators anonymous man all right
01:21:15 well they gotta consider this a consider this a very tepid very tepid
01:21:20 lukewarm non-committal endorsement of that certainly not the best not validating
01:21:28 the best time some might say okay now look look I'm not gonna lie to you the
01:21:35 next one's a bad voicemail but but oh my you should listen to it make
01:21:40 you should hate thinks it's bad I just in had a visceral enjoyment experience
01:21:45 listening to this voice I wonder if this is gonna be one of those cases where I'm
01:21:50 like that wasn't bad that was awesome in its own special well I don't I don't
01:21:54 think so but maybe it's from Ukrainian mythbusters like 20 seconds long so

01:22:03 one CP child pornography no thank you I mean to shoot on there being a fat
01:22:11 stack of playboy magazine so together by semen I believe can stop a bullet in
01:22:18 this episode of Ukrainian mythbusters you putting the burst on me
01:22:27 you see what I mean I can't I can't say it's good there was there was something
01:22:33 compelling there yeah it's like to there's a certain undeniable emotional
01:22:41 core behind this terribleness of it putting the boost in your myth or I
01:22:47 think I think that's what he said about I don't know he's mentioned something
01:22:51 about like enough semen stickin together playboys with semen yeah I mean you
01:22:56 intriguing just like the little pause and then please call back like voice

01:24:25 time people see in this no they're not okay it's just that yesterday I got
01:24:29 absolutely blitzed out of my mind laughing at a meme that we were we're
01:24:34 talking about in the bonus episode that we recorded like earlier this month and
01:24:37 it was hilarious as hell I can't tell you what it is okay I'm trying to think
01:24:47 like a cryptic one okay it involves the musical stylings of a oh boy a a regarding
01:24:58 a so a cerulean attack individual what as sung by a aspiring dentist musician
01:25:16 enthusiastic about dental hygiene okay all right that's the best way beyond my
01:25:21 ability to decipher listen the new bonus episode I will have to go to patreon.com
01:25:28 slash TP crassinators the procrastinators and pay fine and if I pay poultry meager
01:25:37 pittance of five dollars to get a cavalcade hours no doubt hours and days
01:25:42 of delicious exclusive content including so like so that I can experience
01:25:47 reverse nostalgia and come back and watch this episode with new context that

01:25:56 new world for you and me now that is based all right next one we've got
01:26:05 ah speaking of voice jail okay straight out of voice jail we've got a message
01:26:10 delivered to us on the outside smuggled out no doubt illicitly from a I'll die
01:26:14 of embarrassment all right I'll die take it away no oh sorry didn't see you there
01:26:26 oh I'm just busy self-flagellating for my horrific offenses you know that's good
01:26:34 last night I said that in my she directed die buster when it was actually
01:26:38 I can't I can't bear you that's the sound of just a moment you're right you're
01:26:48 right I deserve to be here until I can prove that this is not characteristic
01:26:54 please I must suffer for this until you've realized you know until you no
01:27:06 longer identify as someone who mistakes the director of FLCL then then we can
01:27:11 have a conversation this could be the start of a redemption arc perhaps I like
01:27:15 to think so I like to think see his fellow inmates first step I but he I'll die
01:27:21 is sending a good example for his fellow inmates by going above and beyond
01:27:25 what our normal jailers do of torturing and beating them daily by doing it to
01:27:29 himself in his own time and I just want him to know that that is appreciated and
01:27:33 we respect the effort if I think we should send him to voice jail so that he
01:27:37 could be a good example to all the other inmates he's already there he's already
01:27:41 there that's the thing oh he's uh oh okay well good see my instincts were right

01:31:24 tournament we recorded there was a lot of on the PCP was a lot of bullshit at the
01:31:27 beginning because we didn't know what we were doing after an hour and a half it
01:31:31 nobody knew what we were doing and it took a long time for us to actually get
01:31:34 started but once it actually started it was pretty smooth it was relatively
01:31:38 smooth sailing and a fit MC joined us he was hanging out in PCP MC serve baby
01:31:43 it was a good time also which was pretty based yep yep yep well there you go
01:31:48 I had to leave early to go oh yeah that's right and to the what's it called I

01:31:57 I'm sure they have names and that was fun well that's good watch that if you
01:32:02 want to see me talk about that thing that I've made on Twitter Lord you mean
01:32:07 Lord oh your chart right your chart about productivity I could have talked
01:32:10 about it here but I forgot that's fine I thought it was funny I haven't oh just
01:32:15 one of those funny little things you do look at it I guess well link it in the
01:32:23 show notes no doubt and have a gander ladies and gentlemen all right well
01:32:28 yeah that's enough go go play Minecraft with us we'll be we'll be doing more
01:32:31 events we'll be streaming more so you know come fucking play the game with us
01:32:34 and hang out probably do at least one a month and we're always building new
01:32:38 stuff with our admin so that's good time let me see what's going on we've got
01:32:42 follow us on Twitter at tbcrasnators updates and what not radcon stuff chugs
01:32:47 along we're working on a bunch of behind-the-scenes stuff but progress is
01:32:50 being made currently up Ben is holding a production of a certain element that he
01:32:54 needs to get moving on I know it is what it is my fault I have no excuse
01:32:59 anymore yeah correct correct we everyone else has done their duty even when I got
01:33:04 me but I got wow yeah I got the first I got the first pin from the from the
01:33:12 routing no oh my god I want to see it though please link it I I don't think I
01:33:18 tweeted it maybe I should tweet it I saw it somewhere I put yeah why not I'm
01:33:23 excited I will I will I posted it in rfck in the rfck okay the pilot pins
01:33:28 discord I did add everyone I but yeah I got I got the one sample pin and I
01:33:32 compared it to like the poob up in and stuff in size and it looks great is that
01:33:36 from the the Chinese company or the original it's from one Chinese company
01:33:41 I ordered another sample from another company that I was gonna compare the two
01:33:45 I don't know where that one is and they haven't been very communicative and this
01:33:48 one looks about as good as I could hope for us so I might just end up going with
01:33:52 this one just on like a customer service basis but I'm in the pilot pins chat
01:33:57 right now the last message was yesterday is it was a couple days ago
01:34:03 oh okay oh I see it I see it oh looks good pretty good very good looks pretty
01:34:09 yeah it looks great rowdy fucker looking looking sick and solid and I'm sorry
01:34:12 did you say that was the Chinese or was it the other the other company this was
01:34:15 that this is a Chinese company this is a Chinese company I'll just I'll fucking
01:34:19 say I'll fucking it's time to oh shenzhen long you crafts hmm hmm how much
01:34:27 cheaper are they than the original thing they are good quality some amount
01:34:38 I don't remember exactly they're they're considerably cheaper but also shipping
01:34:44 costs a lot more it's the reason why it's not like a as big of a savings as I
01:34:49 was hoping for is because shipping is fucking murder but it's still probably
01:34:54 saving maybe like at least like 50 bucks a pin no yeah we're saving probably
01:35:05 saving like at least several hundred dollars by using these these Chinese
01:35:08 dudes indeed indeed because they have they have more like they're more granular
01:35:13 they give you more options like the the UK based company that I had been using to
01:35:17 make pins it's like they don't they they they will charge they will charge you
01:35:22 like they they wrap the the production fee for the mold into it they don't
01:35:26 charge you separately for the mold they just charge you a base price that
01:35:30 includes the mold and a certain number of pins so you can't like fine tune it
01:35:34 like that they don't charge per color they just have like you can get up to
01:35:38 this many colors yeah presumably they just charge the max as assume that you
01:35:42 will do the maximum stuff like that but yeah this this one looks like pretty
01:35:50 much identical in quality so you know thumbs up success oh you know what I'm
01:35:55 just reminded all of a sudden that I want to extend the olive branch to one
01:35:58 sigh a.k.a. the cyborg because I saw somewhere I think of the car S. Y. Y.
01:36:04 Yeah S. Y. Y. Okay yes not Gungham style not not Gundam style not that sigh not
01:36:11 any other sigh okay because sigh felt I think at least somewhat wronged by my
01:36:16 interpretation of what I self-described as an overly long and dull voicemail
01:36:20 about how the voicemail sucked and and we dabbed on them for a little bit based
01:36:26 on that I just I'm sorry if I misrepresented yeah that's why that's
01:36:29 all I just follow the crowd I think it wasn't the most uncharacteristic but
01:36:34 sigh I want you nobody no bad blood on this I'm sorry if I misrepresented your
01:36:38 point but you have my love and respect that that's it that's it anyway let me
01:36:45 see what the patreon as we said speak pipe leave more voicemails but I
01:36:48 certainly don't need like a dozen from a single person let's be reasonable here
01:36:52 people let's uh let's not burry Nate under a flood just just you know write
01:36:56 down your ideas and just at the end like the day or two before be like okay I'll
01:37:00 be like these three these three are the best ones he probably wasn't gonna play
01:37:03 these ones anyway and to save me the time or I will just skip them cuz as
01:37:09 somebody sitting in 16 I'm just guessing they're not all absolute gems all
01:37:15 right there you go and nobody wants to hear the same voice ten times on an
01:37:18 episode anyway even if they were theoretically all good okay space that
01:37:21 shit out okay I think I think they get the idea okay all right a patron bonus
01:37:26 episodes play Minecraft with us speak pipe TP Crass news Twitter boom there
01:37:31 you go more rad content one of these days we're working on it there it is
01:37:34 thanks for listening everybody we'll see you next week another PCP time another
