00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Today there's
00:00:09 Gibb.
00:00:10 Hi. Hey guys. Read my comic at Gibbontake.site. It's good.
00:00:17 And there's Tom.
00:00:18 Hey guys. Read my comic at Gibbontake.site.
00:00:23 And there's Jess.
00:00:24 Hey.
00:00:25 It's me.
00:00:26 Hey guys. Read my comic at Gibbontake.site.
00:00:30 And there's me. Read my comic at Gibbontake.site. The rarely seen, extremely tired, bestie boy
00:00:40 did not sleep last night because I was under the spell of a temptress demon named Factorio.
00:00:49 And when I closed my eyes and opened them again, 12 hours had passed and I'd watched, like,
00:00:57 of half a season of Star Trek Voyager, which is not as bad as everybody says, and it's
00:01:06 no, it's not. It's pretty good.
00:01:08 And Voyager.
00:01:09 Star Trek Voyager, Ben. We're already recording, so I hope you're recording too.
00:01:15 You may have been. You will not be penalized, but you will be chastised verbally by me.
00:01:20 Fuck you.
00:01:21 That's a price he's willing to pay.
00:01:23 Anyway, Factorio, you build your little factory and you're doing just fine.
00:01:28 Oh, then you run out of coal.
00:01:29 Oh god, you run out of coal.
00:01:30 You gotta get more coal.
00:01:31 Your factory loses power.
00:01:32 What are you gonna do?
00:01:33 Oh, you gotta expand your walls.
00:01:34 You gotta build more concrete walls everywhere.
00:01:36 Oh god, did you know that in Factorio, when you develop more technology and you increase
00:01:42 the level of pollution?
00:01:43 Yes, the level of pollution is tracked in Factorio.
00:01:46 The monsters in the surrounding area of your base evolve and get stronger.
00:01:51 What?
00:01:52 The more fucking shit you do.
00:01:53 So that means more raids.
00:01:54 More raids on your base.
00:01:56 This sounds like a made-up game.
00:01:57 It's a nightmare.
00:01:58 I don't believe that this is surreal.
00:01:59 What the fuck?
00:02:00 What is Factorio?
00:02:01 And then you get your fucking, oh my god, then you get your laser grid running, but then
00:02:07 you realize by making your whole fucking laser grid defense system to attach to your electrical
00:02:14 system, if one goes down, they all go down and you're fucked and then you've got no defenses
00:02:20 whatsoever, so you can't leave.
00:02:22 You can't stop playing Factorio.
00:02:25 It isn't often.
00:02:26 You can't.
00:02:27 You guys, I waste my whole night.
00:02:28 Can't you save and quit?
00:02:29 It's literally, it's literally, rape is what happened to me.
00:02:33 It forces you to play the game because if you don't, you lose the game.
00:02:38 It's Sisyphus.
00:02:39 It's the Sisyphus ball and it's fucked up and it's cruel, but it is very fun and I
00:02:45 do like making purple potions to evolve my tech trees and stuff, so it's also kind of
00:02:49 cool.
00:02:50 Anyway, I'm tired.
00:02:51 Star Trek Voyager is better than people say it is.
00:02:54 Good topic.
00:02:55 Nate, you know who's cool?
00:02:58 Tuvok.
00:03:00 Dude, bro, Tuvok, episode's about Tuvok just being sad that he's away from his five children
00:03:05 and a hot Vulcan wife.
00:03:07 That always hits me right in the right spot.
00:03:09 God, I wish I had a hot Vulcan wife.
00:03:11 Oh no, and here comes another episode about how Nelix was traumatized by his home planet
00:03:16 being destroyed and his whole family dying.
00:03:19 Wham, my whole family died.
00:03:21 Give me a fucking break.
00:03:23 I don't know if you've seen it before, but there is an episode later in the series where
00:03:27 Nelix and Tuvok go into the transporter together.
00:03:32 That episode was not okay.
00:03:34 That was not an acceptable episode.
00:03:37 They morph into a single entity called Tuvix and he's like, he's all the logic and reason
00:03:45 of Tuvok, but with all of the retardation and autism and charm and the resourcefulness
00:03:53 and embarrassment and humiliating stupidity of Nelix combined into one great but horrible
00:04:01 person.
00:04:02 And then at the end of the episode, they have to essentially decide whether to euthanize
00:04:05 him by separating him back into his old selves.
00:04:08 And he's all sad about it, like, no, I'm a new entity, please don't kill me.
00:04:12 And they're like, no, we don't like you.
00:04:14 We want Tuvok back.
00:04:16 I really cannot impress upon people, and I think we talked about this in the PCP because
00:04:19 I just saw that episode.
00:04:20 I could not believe the way that they framed that in the episode as it straight up is like
00:04:26 Tuvix is like, he's working on the bridge or whatever they're like a Tuvix.
00:04:29 We order you to submit yourself for destruction.
00:04:32 He's like, no, I don't care if it's cowardly.
00:04:34 I get to decide if I live or die.
00:04:36 And every member of the crew, like one by one, as if it was a fucking, I don't know, like
00:04:42 walking down the aisle or something, they all turn their back on him as Janeway orders
00:04:47 him to death as he fights for survival.
00:04:50 And just, it was the most fucked up thing I've ever seen a Starfleet captain do, I think,
00:04:56 just order one person to die for the greater good.
00:04:59 What the fuck?
00:05:00 You can't do that Star Trek.
00:05:02 You can't do that.
00:05:03 They just fucking did.
00:05:05 A captain is not supposed to order people to their death against their will when they don't
00:05:08 want to die.
00:05:09 There would be times when my boy Chakote, yo, tum, tum, Chakote, me speak Indian tribe words
00:05:15 based, thoroughly based, when truly the strangest alien of all, the Native American.
00:05:22 When a captain does shit that puts the crew in danger and they're acting irrationally
00:05:29 or unfairly, there are many people on the ship who have the authority to remove the
00:05:34 captain from command, namely the first officer being the main one, but also the medical officer
00:05:39 and shit.
00:05:40 If he had, like, ordered, if Jan would order, like, the whole crew to, like, you know, commit
00:05:44 suicide or something, they'd be like, okay, well, that's not okay, but what if she had
00:05:47 just ordered, she ordered one man to commit suicide because she wanted the other two guys
00:05:53 back, personally.
00:05:54 That was a personal thing for her.
00:05:56 That's, like, there was no, you can't even argue that, like, oh, they're stranded in the
00:06:01 Delta Quadrant.
00:06:02 She needs a Tuvok back.
00:06:04 She had all the strengths of Tuvok.
00:06:06 That was arguable that Tuvoks was better than both of them individually and had, like,
00:06:10 both their strengths combined.
00:06:12 So, this was not, like, it's coldly, there was no emergency.
00:06:16 See, I thought they would frame the episode as there would be an emergency.
00:06:19 They, in this particular situation, they had to force them to defuse.
00:06:23 I guess that would make more sense.
00:06:24 That's what they usually do stuff like that.
00:06:25 Yeah, that's what they usually do stuff like that to get by it.
00:06:27 What if the fused person has a very short lifespan, but they just want to live it out?
00:06:32 I think Janeway's philosophy on this decision might have been that they need Tuvok and Nelix
00:06:39 to be separated in case the opportunity arises to also sacrifice Nelix.
00:06:49 You know what?
00:06:50 It all makes sense now.
00:06:51 You know, everybody b******s about Nelix.
00:06:53 I haven't even found him particularly annoying.
00:06:56 There's, like, one good Nelix episode where, like, somebody dies
00:07:01 and he, like, loses his faith in his stupid cat religion.
00:07:05 Oh, yeah, in the Great Forest or whatever.
00:07:07 Yeah.
00:07:08 He personally dies, experiences no afterlife and completely loses his faith.
00:07:12 Yeah, that episode was like a-
00:07:13 That was a tear-jerker.
00:07:15 That was a good episode because he-
00:07:16 Hey, wait a minute.
00:07:18 Nelix, Nelix.
00:07:22 Nelix.
00:07:24 Nelix, Brony Documentary.
00:07:26 Remember that?
00:07:28 Sounds about right.
00:07:29 Damn, I haven't heard that name in a while.
00:07:31 Jesse, did you beat the remake yet?
00:07:33 I did.
00:07:34 I did.
00:07:35 You did.
00:07:36 It is completed.
00:07:37 I'm halfway through and I've decided to stop playing it because I don't like it.
00:07:42 I don't think it's your kind of game, Tom.
00:07:44 Just, even though a lot of people like it, it just doesn't strike me as a Tom kind of game.
00:07:49 So boring.
00:07:56 Really?
00:07:57 The side quests are just the worst, the absolute worst.
00:08:01 Absolutely.
00:08:02 We are.
00:08:03 What do you mean?
00:08:04 Forgot to see it.
00:08:05 Ben, I said before, we're all recording this.
00:08:07 Forgot to see it.
00:08:09 Well, that's why I said, Ben, we're recording this.
00:08:11 I hope you are too because we started ahead of time.
00:08:14 You know, that's why that was clarified.
00:08:16 Well, I'm recording now.
00:08:18 Okay.
00:08:19 You started early.
00:08:20 You're not supposed to start before 3.10, but that's fine.
00:08:24 There's no rule that we have to start at 3.10.
00:08:27 I didn't know anyone else was showing up.
00:08:30 We said, okay, if someone shows up, we won't pedal.
00:08:32 There are more guidelines than actual rules.
00:08:35 Sorry.
00:08:36 Well, in any case.
00:08:37 For the six previous minutes that I was in Audible.
00:08:40 Okay.
00:08:41 Indeed.
00:08:43 Right.
00:08:44 Tom.
00:08:45 Final Fantasy game.
00:08:47 The side quests are just so modern game design and I don't like them.
00:08:54 That's definitely true.
00:08:55 But Tom, I was wondering about this.
00:08:56 Why not just not do them?
00:08:57 Why not just skip all the side quests?
00:08:59 Are they skippable?
00:09:00 Some of them aren't.
00:09:01 Some of them are not.
00:09:02 There are some places where you have to do at least one, I think.
00:09:05 I'm in the wall market right now and Arith just got in her dress and it's just like,
00:09:10 you know, hang out around the town with Johnny Cloud while I just doll Arith up.
00:09:15 I'm like, oh, this sucks.
00:09:16 I hate this.
00:09:17 I think you have to do like one and then you can go back and trigger it or something to
00:09:21 progress, I believe.
00:09:22 It's pretty gay and I don't like it.
00:09:25 Do the squats.
00:09:26 Do the squats, bro.
00:09:27 I did the squats.
00:09:28 That was the first thing I did.
00:09:29 I destroyed it and I thought it was going to be way harder, but it was literally just
00:09:33 hitting a button in order.
00:09:36 Okay.
00:09:37 Yep.
00:09:38 Yep.
00:09:39 I'm sick.
00:09:40 It was fine.
00:09:41 So the game is kind of set up in a way where you kind of feel like you can't not do the
00:09:47 side quests because it puts you in these chapters that are basically just side quest chapters
00:09:52 and it tells you don't go to the thing until you do all the stuff.
00:09:55 So it like guilt trips you every time you try and like do something and then it like
00:10:00 punks you because you'll do all the side quests and then you'll go to the next part
00:10:04 of the mission.
00:10:06 Are you sure you want to go inside already, Cloud?
00:10:08 I'm like, what do you mean?
00:10:09 I did everything.
00:10:10 It's all checked off.
00:10:11 You know, I wish they would change the dialogue.
00:10:13 So it's like, okay, wow, you've had a full day, Cloud, time for a good night's rest after
00:10:18 all that activity.
00:10:19 Yeah.
00:10:20 That would go a long way for me.
00:10:22 And the way that it's set up like that kind of makes it so that there's no real secrets
00:10:27 in the game because everything that is extra is right there.
00:10:31 It's a side mission that is given to you and you just know about it immediately.
00:10:35 You know, I think like the only actual like secret boss is the Bahamut thing, but that's
00:10:39 not even secret.
00:10:40 You just know exactly what to do with the whole game.
00:10:42 Just do all the guys.
00:10:43 You know, that's a spoil.
00:10:44 I do think there is one other thing beyond that that I've heard.
00:10:46 I haven't done it myself, but I'm looking into it.
00:10:48 I think there's one other boss.
00:10:51 Speaking of things that are in the game, it looks like I won that bet from last week.
00:10:56 What was the bet?
00:10:57 About whether you could have a date with Aretha Tifa or Barrett.
00:11:03 It looks like yes, you can.
00:11:05 That's not really a date.
00:11:07 Part two is now.
00:11:08 Well, I mean, there's like one scene Slimes send me a link that said Final Fantasy 7 remake
00:11:19 date mechanics and romance scenes and it says date event happens in chapter 14 at the beginning
00:11:24 of chapter 14.
00:11:25 A dating event will occur where Cloud visits Aretha's garden at night.
00:11:28 Yeah, there's one scene where the part where you're staying at Aretha's house, Aretha's
00:11:33 house.
00:11:34 I'm not saying Aretha.
00:11:35 You can't make me.
00:11:36 No one can do it.
00:11:39 We are staying at our house.
00:11:40 There's a scene where like inside your Barrett or Tifa, Aretha's in the garden and you talk
00:11:45 to them for like two minutes.
00:11:46 That's right, that's right.
00:11:47 It's not really a date though.
00:11:48 It's more like what are you doing out here in the garden?
00:11:50 Okay, tell you what's bad.
00:11:51 I will go back.
00:11:52 If it can be Tifa, Aretha's or Barrett, I'm pretty sure that's what I, that's it.
00:12:00 Well, okay, I mean, I'll have to go listen to the exact wording of the agreement.
00:12:06 If it's fair, if that's an accurate representation, we were talking about the gold saucer, but
00:12:11 if this covers that, I'll pay five bucks if I was just wrong about that.
00:12:15 It was ten.
00:12:16 You know, that's...
00:12:17 I mean, the term was that there would be a date.
00:12:19 There would be a date scene between...
00:12:23 But this isn't even a date.
00:12:24 It's one conversation.
00:12:25 But it's the same thing.
00:12:26 If there's a thing where you can get either Tifa or Aretha or Barrett with Cloud, that's
00:12:31 the new version of the same thing.
00:12:34 I mean, I thought we were specifically talking about the gold saucer.
00:12:37 Well, viewers, I don't know.
00:12:39 Go back and listen to the audio and draw your own conclusions.
00:12:42 I mean, I don't think...
00:12:43 Who won the bet?
00:12:44 I don't think in the written up bet that there was like it has to be the gold saucer
00:12:48 one, but that's what we...
00:12:50 We talked about it.
00:12:51 We nailed down our terms.
00:12:52 Exactly what we were discussing about it.
00:12:53 No, who gives a hoot?
00:12:54 I want my ten dollars.
00:12:55 Let's look into it.
00:12:56 You know what's really fucking goofy about Final Fantasy 7 Remake that I write in the
00:13:01 beginning when you're going on like the bombing mission, like the second bomb mission, Reactor
00:13:05 Five or whatever, and you're having all those scenes in the subway car, and I don't know.
00:13:13 Maybe it's just me nitpicking, and this isn't really a problem, but I just found it hilarious
00:13:17 that it's like all these normal-looking people in business suits going to work, and then
00:13:21 Barrett just walks in with a fucking gatling gun on his arm and sword has this giant, and
00:13:25 cloud has this giant fucking sword, and nobody cares, and it's just like, oh man, these terrorist
00:13:30 guys are pretty scary.
00:13:31 I would hate to run into them.
00:13:32 Hi, Mr. Gatling Gunman.
00:13:35 Good to see you going to work today, and it's just like, how am I supposed to take this
00:13:39 seriously?
00:13:40 You know, to be fair, it was always like that, but I would argue this is one of those things
00:13:45 that just gets weirder, the more realistic.
00:13:47 If this was a PS1 blocky man game, it would just be fine, but because this is so realistic,
00:13:54 I'm just like, these people would notice that there's a man running around with a machine
00:13:57 gun strapped to his arm.
00:13:58 I've always thought it was very strange that nobody comments ever about Barrett having
00:14:03 a big old gun on his arm.
00:14:04 But he has this photorealistic argument with the Shinra employee, and why would you call
00:14:10 out the man with the machine gun arm in a tiny and closed space?
00:14:14 Are you kidding me?
00:14:16 I also like that the Shinra employee looks at the man with the machine gun for an arm
00:14:24 who is very clearly obviously a terrorist, and says, I bet you support the terrorists.
00:14:33 As Barrett comes in to defend the terrorists in the conversation.
00:14:38 With a bunch of guys behind him who also have guns and swords.
00:14:41 And then it's like later, after you blow up everything and the big fucking robot guy
00:14:47 and you get back from your actor five, and the guy's like, I've broadcasted you terrorists
00:14:52 all over the fucking world.
00:14:54 Everybody knows who you are.
00:14:55 You just get off the train and walk around as cloud and nobody cares.
00:14:59 I'm just like, everyone was just paying attention to this epic fight, and they know who the
00:15:04 terrorists are.
00:15:05 They expose Avalanche, but then nobody cares.
00:15:07 They were on the TV.
00:15:09 Like what the fuck?
00:15:10 Why is this happening?
00:15:12 These people should realize that the man with the giant sword on his back, the only blonde
00:15:16 person in the entire world apparently, is now among you ridiculous.
00:15:21 I also like how it shattered.
00:15:24 It was really great.
00:15:26 It was a great logical change how the plate falling on sector seven did not matter at
00:15:32 all and absolutely nobody was hurt even slightly.
00:15:36 Everyone was fine.
00:15:37 Every single person made it out.
00:15:39 Were there people on the top of the plate who lived there, the above grounders who maybe
00:15:44 fell onto them and all the bourgeois died?
00:15:48 That's a good question that would have also been a good question in the original game
00:15:53 and is something that we could have seen expanded upon here and you know, I always wondered
00:15:59 because they said so many times, we're going to expand Midgar, we're going to add things
00:16:05 that maybe should have been there the first time.
00:16:08 Like hunting rats.
00:16:10 Like rescuing a little girl's cats.
00:16:12 Are you fucking kidding me?
00:16:15 One has to think, okay, gee, what are the ways in which you could expand a game that
00:16:20 takes place in a massive eight sector city of which we only previously saw sectors five,
00:16:26 six and seven?
00:16:28 I don't know.
00:16:29 Maybe show me the other sectors of the city.
00:16:34 Maybe let me explore.
00:16:36 Let's just stretch out the areas you've already seen to ridiculous proportions and destroy
00:16:42 the game's pacing completely and make every scene take 50 hours longer.
00:16:46 That makes a lot more sense.
00:16:47 I've been trying to absorb a lot of the people's reception and I think a lot of people just
00:16:51 love that like, I mean, I don't know man, I'm trying to give people the benefit of that
00:16:56 out here, but a lot of people seem to be like totally fine with just getting like, you know,
00:17:01 the same scenes, but now there's like more dialogue and like more expression and like,
00:17:06 oh, you know, Aris looks prettier now in while she's saying, you know, similar things to
00:17:11 before and then the time Janie show up and carry you out of the room.
00:17:15 The more I think about it, just like the more it totally blows my mind and baffles me that
00:17:22 they made the entire game Midgar and did not let me explore all of Midgar.
00:17:29 That was the last 20 years for, if not for that, we get the one extra area, the above
00:17:36 ground place of where Jesse's parents live.
00:17:39 That's one, I believe that is the one and only actual new area that we explore to any
00:17:44 degree and you know, hey, what is right, I forget, what is the difference between the
00:17:50 sectors that we explore in the original Final Fantasy seven is that like a five is where
00:17:56 Wal-Mart it is, five is Aris, and seven is Tifa's bar.
00:18:03 I just wonder like what the other sectors would be like if you did go to them.
00:18:06 Yeah, I've wondered that my whole life, would it just be the same sort of stuff or yeah.
00:18:11 What you guys don't realize is that Final Fantasy seven remake part two is going to be all the
00:18:15 rest of Midgar and just going to be more fetched by, and we never go back until way later.
00:18:20 Not now.
00:18:21 Now it's going to be totally different.
00:18:23 It's going to be Midgar too.
00:18:26 Yeah, you know, I will happily plant my flag though that like, I understand Jesse, I felt
00:18:32 very similar for a long time, however, I long since have thought that like, even if we did
00:18:37 explore that, that Square Enix would not fill those areas with anything good or satisfying.
00:18:43 So that, I mean, that's been my issue, so I just had no hope.
00:18:46 Another thing about this game that is incredibly silly is that it's trying to like set up these
00:18:50 tense moments, but then it seems to want to add gameplay that undermines those moments.
00:18:56 And I find it very funny.
00:18:58 Like the, you know, like you, you rescue Eris, I'm going to keep saying Eris because I'm
00:19:06 playing this game, but forgive me for my sins.
00:19:09 But and you fight the like the Turk guy and like the first, the guy is like, you have
00:19:13 to learn how to use the counter and stuff to beat him.
00:19:15 Yes.
00:19:16 And all the fucking crazy ghost men are in the house and you're trying to escape like
00:19:19 they're chasing you.
00:19:21 And it gets to a point where like you have to knock down a chandelier or something to
00:19:26 like distract them and like get Eris out of there.
00:19:29 And it's like supposed to be this tense scene of like making this one like distracting move
00:19:33 so you can both get out of there and they start shooting at you as you're supposed to get
00:19:37 away.
00:19:38 But instead of just making it a cut scene, you have to like slowly grapple on the ceiling
00:19:42 and you're just getting shot with bullets and they're doing like two points of damage.
00:19:45 I'm like, so this just I could just sit here for like 40 minutes and take like a tenth
00:19:50 of my actual HP and damage and they just won't move from this one spot tension deflated.
00:19:57 And it's just like, why, why do it like that?
00:20:00 Just have it be a cut scene.
00:20:02 There's so many things like that.
00:20:04 Like at a certain point, you get like melee weapons for Barrett and one of them is just
00:20:10 like a big stupid steel ball.
00:20:12 Yeah, I know.
00:20:13 But like in the cut scenes, you still have Barrett like threatening people with a gun.
00:20:18 Like I'm going to shoot you with this big stupid steel ball that does nothing.
00:20:23 Oh, I like this big like scissor hand one.
00:20:26 He would point.
00:20:27 Oh, he's going to cut you.
00:20:28 Barrett's going to.
00:20:29 Yeah.
00:20:30 I've also always thought it was, I mean, I appreciate that Barrett has some like melee weapons
00:20:33 because it's always been weird that like the biggest hulkenist roided out his boy is
00:20:37 like gunman.
00:20:38 They're terrible to use.
00:20:39 They're so slow.
00:20:40 Yeah.
00:20:41 And like the fun of Barrett is shooting.
00:20:44 Yeah, but yeah.
00:20:46 And in the in the original game, you didn't have that problem because it was all just
00:20:49 to turn base the same battle system for everyone.
00:20:51 So the melee attacks were just as quick and snappy as the gun attacks.
00:20:56 Were you were you disappointed spoilers?
00:20:59 I guess for Tom and other people, not really spoiler that that red 13 was not playable.
00:21:04 I mean, I kind of thought that was reasonable considering a little time.
00:21:07 He would have been playable for like five minutes.
00:21:09 So what would the yeah, who gives a crap?
00:21:13 But Jesse, tell me the ghost, the time, the final battle, you got to tell me what you think
00:21:18 I've been dying to hear your perspective.
00:21:21 I will say this.
00:21:22 I am not disappointed, obviously, because Square Enix did exactly what Square Enix does
00:21:29 and exactly what I knew Square Enix would do.
00:21:32 You wouldn't be disappointed if a crocodile bit you because that's its nature.
00:21:39 I'm not, I'm not sad.
00:21:40 I'm not angry at Square Enix.
00:21:42 You know who I'm angry at, Nate?
00:21:44 I'm angry at all the people who are only just now crying foul, who are acting surprised
00:21:51 by this.
00:21:52 Who didn't see this coming?
00:21:53 If you didn't see this coming five years ago, then it's exactly what you deserve.
00:21:58 I'll admit, I did not expect them to go this far.
00:22:01 I didn't think they would do this.
00:22:02 I don't know what this ending is.
00:22:04 I've heard a lot of people complain about it, but there was one person on my Twitter
00:22:07 feed who just like, man, I just finished Final Fantasy 7.
00:22:10 Love the ending.
00:22:11 Amazing twist.
00:22:12 Can't wait to see what they do in part two.
00:22:15 Did this person play the original?
00:22:17 Yeah.
00:22:18 Okay.
00:22:19 Well, you know, there's a school of thought that I find reprehensible that any change
00:22:25 is good because it's new.
00:22:27 I played the original, you know, cool game, liked it, but now it's time for new things.
00:22:32 I like things that are different, not the same.
00:22:34 The same is bad and boring.
00:22:35 That's why I bought a game called Final Fantasy 7.
00:22:39 And that really, it opens up a can of worms on like, what was the expectation?
00:22:44 I feel like a lot of people are, you know, I'm so exhausted.
00:22:49 I've been thinking about this so much and like I, last night I was playing factorial
00:22:54 all night.
00:22:55 I maybe want to kill myself.
00:22:56 And then I wake up and I go and I watch like one guy's video.
00:23:00 This was the most sober take I've heard from somebody on YouTube.
00:23:02 Maybe I'll, maybe we'll get his name.
00:23:04 And the whole video, he was like, okay, I was, I did not want this remake.
00:23:10 I was scared of it and I knew it would not be good.
00:23:13 I was by the sky name.
00:23:14 Never knows best.
00:23:16 Never knows best.
00:23:17 Yes.
00:23:18 That's the one.
00:23:19 And he gets to whatever he's talking about.
00:23:20 And he's like, oh, but actually the game won me over because it was like good at points.
00:23:24 And I was like, okay, like sure, the gameplay is kind of fun sometimes.
00:23:27 I agree.
00:23:28 I agree.
00:23:29 But I'm like, okay, but how about he's saving his big point for the end.
00:23:30 And he does get to the end of his point where he's like, okay, yes.
00:23:34 Like the ending is like a nightmare.
00:23:36 The fact that they're like setting us free from destiny.
00:23:39 Like every logical aspect of my body tells me based on knowing these developers and what
00:23:44 screenings does.
00:23:45 Sure.
00:23:46 They're giving themselves free reign to write new stuff.
00:23:48 These people are not good at making stories.
00:23:50 We've seen for decades.
00:23:52 They don't know what they're doing this team.
00:23:54 So to be excited for a new story is nonsensical.
00:23:58 And yet, and yet I'm kind of excited for new stuff guys.
00:24:01 I can't wait to see what happens.
00:24:03 Why would you end on that point?
00:24:05 Why?
00:24:06 My final point was it will be bad, but there's no getting off this train we're on, which
00:24:14 is a cheeky little bit of reference.
00:24:16 I hate that point so much.
00:24:17 It personally offends me.
00:24:18 Like that's a defense of these choices.
00:24:21 Fun fact about that video.
00:24:23 That guy never knows best commented over the last week on my old Final Fantasy 7, you cannot
00:24:30 remake it will be fucking bad video.
00:24:34 And his comment is comment was damn it.
00:24:37 I wanted to use some variant of Final Fantasy 7.
00:24:40 You cannot remake in a video title, but then thought I'd better check to make sure no one
00:24:44 has done so already.
00:24:45 And here I am.
00:24:46 And five fucking years ago to truly ahead of its time really great video.
00:24:49 I loved it to not attend and watch it twice.
00:24:51 So that that review, which I think is still the best review so far that I've seen of the
00:24:57 game from anyone.
00:24:58 It was originally going to be called you cannot remake but he checked out and saw that I already
00:25:03 did that five years ago, which everyone should have checked and seen that I already did that.
00:25:07 You know, I'm seeing yeah, it's making the rounds and I'm even seeing people like attributing
00:25:11 it to people like, oh, how clever for of Pat from two best friends played who have said
00:25:16 that thing.
00:25:17 Yeah, I kind of said it five years ago.
00:25:20 I kind of predicted all of this and you didn't listen.
00:25:22 I warned you all and you didn't listen.
00:25:25 And now now that I'm right, as usual, every time that I'm vindicated and proven right,
00:25:29 nobody cares.
00:25:30 Nobody's going to acknowledge it.
00:25:32 That's all I want.
00:25:33 Just to make knowledge from the world that I told you so just once I've been getting
00:25:36 a couple of comments on my on my video.
00:25:39 Some saying, wow, bro, you were sure we're right.
00:25:41 And others saying this is embarrassing, you know, bet you regret this one now.
00:25:47 And you know, truly it is the duality of man.
00:25:49 I now that I've seen all this, I can't deny that I like had lots of fun playing through
00:25:55 I like, I'm more of a grindy kind of guy in this game was grindy as hell for the side
00:26:00 missions.
00:26:01 And I enjoyed zoning out and watching Star Trek Voyager while engaging in the gameplay
00:26:06 loop, which is pretty fun.
00:26:08 So I like all that stuff.
00:26:09 But but then the whole question rains is like, this could have been Final Fantasy 16 this
00:26:13 battle system with like new stories.
00:26:15 But the fact that it's a remake, the only thing that's relevant to that is like the
00:26:20 story.
00:26:21 That's like the most important thing.
00:26:22 And in my humble opinion, I think some mistakes were made.
00:26:25 So did you find this game to be, I don't know, do you, do you like it?
00:26:30 Is it good?
00:26:31 Are you a fan?
00:26:32 I'm just totally split lots that are good.
00:26:41 I mean, it has like moments of fun, I guess, in terms of the combat, even though I think
00:26:46 the game probably should have just been a standard turn based.
00:26:50 I mean, like by the time the game came out, I had been dreading it for so many years that
00:26:56 like I just didn't care anymore.
00:26:57 So it couldn't have possibly disappointed me or let me down because I was I was just
00:27:02 at a point where it's like, you know what, I don't fucking care.
00:27:04 I'm just going to take the fucking ride.
00:27:07 Fuck it.
00:27:08 And so I did and like again, none of the bad stuff surprised me in any way because it's
00:27:14 exactly what I expected.
00:27:16 So I wasn't like taking a backer like, oh, I can't believe they did this.
00:27:20 I'm like, of course they did that.
00:27:22 That's exactly what they would do.
00:27:23 Yeah.
00:27:24 So I was just kind of like being used by the whole thing.
00:27:26 And I mean, the game was fun.
00:27:28 So I guess everybody was right, but I was the most right.
00:27:34 It's I mean, I generally don't like the mindset.
00:27:38 Of like, you know, I'll accept this, I'll purchase this video game based on the fact
00:27:45 that they they wanted to make money again.
00:27:48 So they just gave it the name of a popular game and then everybody bought it because
00:27:51 it had the name.
00:27:53 And it's, you know, it's okay and it's not great and the original is better in a lot
00:27:57 of ways and blah, blah, but you know, overall, I endorse that this this business practice
00:28:03 and I will do it again the next time they come back with some thing that I recognize
00:28:07 I will buy it and say that it's okay.
00:28:10 And I'll just keep doing that over and over again forever.
00:28:12 That's what we're doing.
00:28:13 That's what we're encouraging.
00:28:14 You know, to me, the most the most offensive part of the whole remake, more offensive than
00:28:19 the Time Jannies or the fucking Kingdom Hearts fighting the big black guy for the beginning
00:28:24 of Kingdom Hearts at the end of the game, not not a black guy like Barrett.
00:28:28 I mean, a big black, you know, like a massive goo.
00:28:31 What's that thing called?
00:28:32 Yeah.
00:28:33 What's the fuck?
00:28:34 Yeah.
00:28:35 You know what I'm everyone knows.
00:28:36 I'm fucking talking.
00:28:37 Literally just that guy is the final boss of the game.
00:28:41 More offensive than that.
00:28:42 More offensive than like the Sephiroth and his stupid wing and a little sword fight with
00:28:45 him at the end, which completely takes away any mystique or power or, you know, threat
00:28:50 of him.
00:28:51 Some people are like, oh, I can't wait for them to read Victor.
00:28:53 They cannot do the rest of the game the way it originally was.
00:28:56 You already kicked his ass.
00:28:57 Now that this has happened.
00:28:58 Claude kicks his ass like in the first part of the game now.
00:29:01 Yeah.
00:29:02 Dude, what about the fucking Advent Children cutscene where he's flying around and cutting
00:29:05 fucking buildings in half?
00:29:07 I'm so confused.
00:29:08 Oh, yeah.
00:29:09 I love how like Nomura only has one ending of a game that he can think of.
00:29:16 It's Kingdom Hearts 2 flying through the buildings.
00:29:19 Yeah.
00:29:20 Whether it's a movie or a game, that's all he knows how to write.
00:29:22 It's just, oh, what do I do at the end here?
00:29:24 Oh, they fly through a void and cut buildings in half.
00:29:27 That'll be cool.
00:29:28 Do you put much stock into this thing that like, oh, it's okay that that happened, Jesse,
00:29:32 because it was in like an alternate dimension world where like, you know, it wasn't, it
00:29:37 was like an alternate dimension world, you know, they weren't in like literal Midgar.
00:29:41 They were in like fake wreckage world.
00:29:43 So it's like, okay, that Claude, and like it makes sense that Claude could like fly
00:29:47 and get what you're saying.
00:29:49 I fucking, who gives a fuck?
00:29:51 I just don't want to have this conversation is the main thing.
00:29:54 I don't want to have to think about these things.
00:29:55 I fucking like did a backflip off of a motorcycle onto another motorcycle in definitely real
00:30:00 Midgar.
00:30:01 I don't know if that really flies.
00:30:03 You know, it's like, there are parts in the story where it tries to do the advent children
00:30:07 flipping off motorcycle stuff, but there are also a lot of parts where it tries to be
00:30:11 more grounded and have like realistic physics.
00:30:14 And it's just totally clashes with itself because it can't decide whether it's an anime
00:30:18 or like a realistic, you know, cyberpunk dystopia.
00:30:22 It's part in the original, I mean, in the good one when Claude was in a coma and ate
00:30:28 shit and died and fell in a wheelchair into the fucking live stream.
00:30:32 That was now that was advent children shit.
00:30:35 I want to see.
00:30:36 I want to see him tumble, crippled down a fucking hill and his fucking wheelchair get
00:30:41 pushed by Tifa because she's been caring for him for too long.
00:30:43 She's sick of his shit because it's part eight of the fucking remake.
00:30:46 And it's the whole game where you just play taking care of clouds, retarded brain simulator.
00:30:52 And you know, at the bad end is where, oh, fuck, I'm sick of this guy.
00:30:55 He didn't even like me.
00:30:57 He chose areas over.
00:30:58 He did the era state instead of me.
00:30:59 So she fucking, you know, euthanized them and it's supposed to play.
00:31:02 Yeah.
00:31:03 Hilarious.
00:31:04 That's.
00:31:05 Oh, right.
00:31:06 My point.
00:31:07 More offensive than all that.
00:31:08 Even more offensive than Zach, you know, that whole shit, the cra...
00:31:12 More offense, the most offense, the one part of the game that actually made me yell at
00:31:16 my TV screen.
00:31:17 Oh, fuck you was Rufus Shinra's pants.
00:31:24 The pants, the design.
00:31:26 The whole damn guy.
00:31:28 As soon as I saw those pants, I thought, there's the Nomura I know.
00:31:34 That's my boy.
00:31:36 You know, but he designed Shinra the first time.
00:31:39 Yeah.
00:31:40 They're, what happened?
00:31:41 Well, I can tell you exactly what happened is he was new to the company and he had no
00:31:47 real authority and someone told him probably Sakaguchi or like the people responsible for
00:31:53 designing Midgar in the look of the game.
00:31:55 They probably said to him, this is the look of the game.
00:31:58 We are going for a Western steampunk, you know, cyberpunk, technological, modern aesthetic.
00:32:05 People have to be dressed like they would fit in the modern age.
00:32:08 The bad guys are not wearing like cleric robes or wizard robes or no one's wearing night
00:32:14 armor.
00:32:15 We're wearing like suits, like people wear in real life, draw the characters like that.
00:32:19 And the characters to just look like regular people for the most part in regular clothes
00:32:23 because that's the aesthetic of the game.
00:32:25 And because he was a lowly grunt at the time, he said, yes, boss, this is what I will do.
00:32:31 I will please my bosses and he designed them that way.
00:32:34 But deep down inside, he had a burning rage going, oh God, if only I could make them anime,
00:32:40 I just want to make them more anime.
00:32:43 And so now 20 years later, he has taken the reins of the company in this slow, insidious
00:32:49 hostile takeover, also that he could get to this moment and finally rectify that one mistake
00:32:54 and finally he can turn these characters into anime and have weird cut up pants that look
00:33:00 like they went through a paper shredder.
00:33:02 And so that's what he did now.
00:33:04 He's finally fixed his greatest regret in life.
00:33:06 He's made characters look significantly stupider.
00:33:10 Reno, his whole thing is that he's, you know, he's kind of lazy and slovenly.
00:33:15 So his suit is, you know, like it's open.
00:33:19 He doesn't wear like a tie.
00:33:20 He doesn't have his coat buttoned up.
00:33:22 That tells you all you need to know about the character.
00:33:24 Right there.
00:33:25 It's perfectly fine.
00:33:26 All the other Turks are buttoned up and they look spiffy and snazzy.
00:33:29 Don't you love how we've improved the pacing of the game by having Cloud immediately kick
00:33:33 Reno's ass in their first meeting, deflating all tension or narrative weight of Turks?
00:33:37 But it's not enough for him to just have his jacket open and not have a tie on.
00:33:43 He has to have like a weird anime sash around it.
00:33:47 Did you notice the weird sash?
00:33:49 No, I did not notice that.
00:33:50 I did not.
00:33:51 I'll take your word for it though.
00:33:52 Like his jacket is not an actual, it doesn't have buttons.
00:33:55 It's not just unbuttoned.
00:33:56 It has no buttons.
00:33:57 It just has a weird sash.
00:34:02 It's a small thing to complain about, I know, but really the pants is what just was like
00:34:05 a step.
00:34:06 That was crossing the line for me.
00:34:07 That was the point where I finally went, you son of a bitch, those pants are the worst
00:34:12 thing I have ever seen in my life.
00:34:14 How am I supposed to make this guy seriously as a threat when he looks like that?
00:34:19 God, I mean, Rude looks great.
00:34:21 Rude just looks like he always looked, aka good and cool.
00:34:23 He looks like a teenager at prom in 2007.
00:34:27 Yes, Reno does.
00:34:29 Rude is based in Red Pilled and Love.
00:34:32 Not Rude.
00:34:33 Yeah.
00:34:34 Rude looks good.
00:34:35 Love is black tie.
00:34:36 Black on black, baby.
00:34:37 What was I going to say?
00:34:39 The argument around Rufus's design in the remake, I think it really, it's such a great
00:34:45 microcosm of everyone's thought process because obviously this is detail that doesn't matter
00:34:49 that much, but it informs the character it's interesting, right?
00:34:53 It's like you say, oh, God, they changed his design.
00:34:56 What's that about?
00:34:57 Then the response is going to be like, oh, he looks fine.
00:35:01 What's the problem?
00:35:02 Okay, well, I'm actually looking at it and I just don't like it.
00:35:04 It doesn't really fit with the character, blah, blah, blah.
00:35:06 Then the response becomes, well, Nomura did it.
00:35:08 He's the one who designed it originally, so what are you complaining about?
00:35:11 It's the same people doing it.
00:35:13 Okay, well, you know, times have changed.
00:35:15 Nomura designed it when he had bosses and people smarter than him telling him what
00:35:19 to do, but now that he doesn't have people higher up telling him what to do, he can do
00:35:23 whatever stupid shit he's always wanted to do, and so now the characters look stupid.
00:35:28 It doesn't even make sense from a character standpoint.
00:35:30 Rufus is like this silver spoon.
00:35:31 He's the heir to the company.
00:35:32 He's dressed to impress at all times.
00:35:34 He would just be wearing a regular suit, wouldn't he?
00:35:37 That makes sense.
00:35:38 It's not a phase, dad.
00:35:39 It's not a regular suit that's white and cool looking.
00:35:41 No, he has to have silly, goofy, paper shredder anime pants.
00:35:45 Rufus Shinra has become Ben St. going to Hot Topic, buying those big ass pants with
00:35:50 straps and shit, going, it's not a phase, mom, goth is a lifestyle, and I will choose
00:35:55 to live by it.
00:35:56 This will be my governing policy when I take over Shinra.
00:35:59 I do think I would have really liked this look when I was a teenager.
00:36:03 That's true.
00:36:04 You would have appreciated it.
00:36:05 It looks big.
00:36:07 It looks big, bulky, and a skirt.
00:36:10 Does it look like a flowing coat?
00:36:12 To be fair, I want to point out that the original Rufus did not simply have pants.
00:36:18 He did have sort of like a long coat thing going on.
00:36:21 Okay, that's true.
00:36:22 It didn't look like this, but I mean, polygons would not have allowed it.
00:36:28 Indeed.
00:36:29 I mean, it wasn't this.
00:36:31 It wasn't like this.
00:36:33 This fuck.
00:36:34 This is some fucking Hot Topic bullshit.
00:36:36 Yes.
00:36:37 Yes.
00:36:38 I mean, his design was a bit silly before, but we've just really taken it to 11 now,
00:36:43 and I mean, it just kind of looked like he was wearing a trench coat, which, yeah, yeah,
00:36:48 which was cool.
00:36:49 Well, it's like, he's got like a suit jacket over a trench coat, which is a little weird.
00:36:53 It is weird.
00:36:54 I fully acknowledge his design was kind of strange previously.
00:36:58 I just think it's clearly way more so and more Hot Topic-y now than it was before.
00:37:04 The case.
00:37:05 Indeed.
00:37:06 Well, there you go.
00:37:07 I mean, of course, and eventually, I don't know, the whole thing just comes back to like,
00:37:12 yeah, I mean, you know, you remake something and like you can't encapsulate like every
00:37:18 little detail of a thing in a, you can't just upscale everything and give them all the same
00:37:23 spells and stuff and expect it to be like the same experience.
00:37:27 You know what?
00:37:28 In that guy, Never Knows Best video, he made a chart that was very educational where he
00:37:32 pointed out that like product is made and then like divergent path, person interprets
00:37:37 product and then there's another divergent path, other person interprets product.
00:37:41 But then that other guy who interpreted it, in this case, the creators or whatever, then
00:37:45 they make a remake and then it is consumed by the viewer and the dichotomy between like
00:37:50 the different interpretations of the thing.
00:37:52 Like I just don't care.
00:37:53 I just don't care what any individual developer thought about Final Fantasy VII when it was
00:37:57 being developed.
00:37:58 It can be interesting to know, but I don't care.
00:38:00 What I care about is the product that actually came out.
00:38:02 That's the only thing that matters and it was good.
00:38:05 And this is the reason for all the issues that I'm seeing before me right now.
00:38:10 Well, actually, that's not even true.
00:38:11 When you just change the whole story and add literal fate deviation mechanics to a plot.
00:38:18 Okay.
00:38:20 The way that it was handled with the time janitors and stuff and like Sephiroth like
00:38:28 vaguely being aware of Destiny and Eris vaguely being aware, but they don't really say whether
00:38:33 or not they are or not.
00:38:34 They don't really explain it.
00:38:35 Fuck you, Eris.
00:38:36 Spit it out.
00:38:37 You fucking bitch.
00:38:38 Just say that you know who.
00:38:39 It's like that.
00:38:40 It was handled very clunkily and very terribly and badly because Nomura wrote it.
00:38:44 So of course it was.
00:38:45 Because they want to leave everything wide open because they don't know what they're
00:38:47 doing.
00:38:48 Right.
00:38:49 The concept of it itself, I don't really give a shit about either way because of course
00:38:53 it was going to be a new canon.
00:38:54 Why would you even expect anything else?
00:38:57 I mean the fact that a remake exists in the first place is itself an indication of new
00:39:03 canon because it's going to be different.
00:39:05 It was always going to be different to some degree and the fact that it's different to
00:39:09 a large degree doesn't change anything.
00:39:13 People are saying, it's kind of getting on my nerves how many people are going, oh they
00:39:18 falsely advertised it as a remake.
00:39:21 They lied to us.
00:39:22 No, they didn't.
00:39:25 You know, you're not going to find anyone more defensive of the original Final Fantasy
00:39:30 7 than me but this argument that they somehow falsely advertised or lied to people doesn't
00:39:34 hold water for me.
00:39:35 It just sounds like stupid.
00:39:38 I believe that a little bit.
00:39:40 I'm not one of these people who would sue them.
00:39:42 I just feel cheated by playing the product.
00:39:46 In order to believe that it was going to be an exact representation of the original,
00:39:51 you would have had to not pay attention to Square Enix for the last 20 years.
00:39:56 I don't think that, I think you're trying to give them a pass on this issue that just
00:40:02 because they've made bad stories, a remake, people have been bringing up the example and
00:40:09 it was a bunch of people like never knows best, whatever, people will be like I love
00:40:12 getting my expectations subverted.
00:40:15 Remember Metal Gear Solid 2 guys?
00:40:17 That was so genius.
00:40:18 This game, it could have been good, it was just done bad.
00:40:21 A sequel is not the same as a remake.
00:40:24 There are things you can do in a sequel that is a totally different situation from calling
00:40:29 something a remake.
00:40:30 When they remade Final Fantasy 4 in the 3D models for the DS, that was a remake.
00:40:37 Why didn't they change the story?
00:40:39 Why didn't they do that?
00:40:40 Because it's Final Fantasy 4 a remake.
00:40:43 Why did they change it this time?
00:40:45 I don't know because they don't want to gamble on making Final Fantasy 16 so they put all
00:40:49 their hopes on a remake and they cram all their terrible ideas into this because it's
00:40:53 what they got.
00:40:54 It's because they know it'll sell.
00:40:56 This is the rationale going on in my mind and I find it deceptive and duplicitous.
00:41:01 I do not think they deserve a pass in the same way that you can give.
00:41:05 I'm not giving them a pass, I'm just saying.
00:41:09 All this anger and betrayal that people are dealing with now, I have been dealing with
00:41:15 and coming to terms with since it was announced.
00:41:20 Since Advent Children came out in 2005, that's when I noticed that this train was going off
00:41:25 the fucking rails.
00:41:26 So I've just long since come to terms with this.
00:41:29 I can't muster the kind of gamer rage that so many are having over this because it's
00:41:34 like yeah, what did you expect?
00:41:37 I have been uniquely surprised by the particular way that this has happened.
00:41:42 I did not expect it so perhaps, I don't know, that's why I feel strongly.
00:41:48 There was a good point that never knows best brought up in his video that I agree with,
00:41:52 I think, maybe, and would like to expand on just to see if I agree with it coming out
00:41:58 of my own face.
00:42:01 So this idea of we're going to remake a little bit of the game first and then use that as
00:42:08 a springboard to maybe surprise people and tell a new story, okay, I can, you know what?
00:42:15 I can deal, I can vibe with it, that's fine.
00:42:18 Do your silly little fan fiction, do whatever crazy stupid bullshit you want, so go ahead
00:42:23 and surprise me in the next game, that's fine.
00:42:25 However, what makes more sense to make this deviation when they leave Midgar or to make
00:42:33 this deviation, oh, I don't know, at the part of the game where the disc changed, where
00:42:40 Aris dies, the most important scene in the game, wouldn't that make more sense to be
00:42:46 the point where the story of this first one ends and then you put a little stinger in
00:42:50 there that says, hey, maybe we can deviate a little bit, wouldn't that be better in every
00:42:56 way?
00:42:57 Well, that just gets back into the issue that is so easy for us to ignore now that this
00:43:01 is a tenth of a fucking game, that this is, you know, like, it's so easy to forget that
00:43:06 with everything going on.
00:43:08 And like, in some way, I guess the way they're doing it, like, okay, they've kind of given
00:43:11 themselves leverage because they are going to be doing just something different now.
00:43:14 But I mean, I just don't trust them, I don't trust the artistic integrity of these people
00:43:19 to like, they sat down like five years ago and said, here's what we're doing, guys, we're
00:43:23 making the first one at the end, we're including a scene where we say Destiny's Change and
00:43:28 this is our plan, we know what we're doing, they don't know what they're doing, there
00:43:32 is no plan, they just know that now they've given themselves the ability to do anything,
00:43:36 so they did not sit down, I guarantee you, and plan anything beyond like, guys, what
00:43:41 if we subverted expectations, what if we did that?
00:43:45 This is their guiding star, and they think it makes a good game, and they're wrong,
00:43:51 because there's a lot, there's like meaning, but I guess nothing means anything, right?
00:43:54 Like every story, it doesn't matter how good or what the point of a story is, it just matters
00:43:58 if it subverts expectations, that's all that matters, right?
00:44:02 I wonder if they're going to somehow, like, make Sephiroth like, turn good and be like,
00:44:10 we have to stop Genova, guys, she was the bad, Genova was bad, I'm on the team now,
00:44:15 and Sephiroth just joins the party, I'm just, I'm just spittballing ways that it could be
00:44:19 silly and stupid at this point, because I'm just entertained by it.
00:44:21 I think you're going to save Eris and kill Tifa, I think this motherfucker is going to
00:44:24 do the stupidest possible thing, I mean, hey, it's a new world, maybe, we can do whatever
00:44:29 we want, so let's save Eris and kill Tifa, that is the most obvious thing you could
00:44:33 possibly do, and I would put money, it's going to happen, I would bet, I'll bet anybody
00:44:38 ten dollars right now, Eris lives, Tifa dies, I will bet that happens, who wants to take
00:44:43 me up for ten dollars?
00:44:45 It's certainly possible, anything's possible.
00:44:51 Anything's possible.
00:44:52 I don't know, I don't know whether you can kill a woman these days, I don't know if
00:44:59 that's possible.
00:45:00 Yeah, I mean, Jesse, you've seen the end now, nobody died, as you said, forget that, every
00:45:06 Avalanche member, oh, sorry, we don't know, the millions of Avalanche members that are
00:45:10 out there, but the ones we're doing now, they're all alive.
00:45:14 Just this once, Rose, everyone lives, everybody, they're all fine.
00:45:19 I don't know, I said this somewhere before, but in Gernlagen, the show, there's an episode
00:45:25 where all the supporting cast from earlier in the show dies, and a lot of people felt
00:45:30 that it was abrupt and kind of cheap and kind of sucked, but they all died.
00:45:35 When they made a movie, it was basically a remake of that scene, like the second part
00:45:39 of the series, they just changed that scene, such that all those characters just live now,
00:45:45 they just changed it, and what did it do?
00:45:49 It just made people happy, who didn't want to see them die, and it undid a little bit
00:45:54 of the tragedy that moment, but whatever, they piled it on a ketan.
00:45:57 I think that is like the worst, most hacky decision ever made in the history of things
00:46:02 I like, and I mean, it's just exactly the same thing here.
00:46:06 You just don't get to do that.
00:46:08 It makes you sad when a character dies, but that's the point, you're supposed to feel
00:46:15 sad so that you can feel happy when the victory is achieved.
00:46:17 I'm hearing people make this argument.
00:46:19 I mean, yes, literally stories are, you don't need to defend these fictional people that
00:46:24 only exist in fucking bits and bytes, they literally feel no pain, they exist to serve
00:46:30 a story, but I've been hearing people make the argument that like, okay, okay, in the
00:46:35 original, the point of that story, like sure, Sakaguchi had a theme, it was life, right?
00:46:40 The theme of the game was life.
00:46:41 So it's about like, you know, the fragility of life, and you know, like the difference
00:46:46 that human beings can make with their life, and after death, whoa bro, maybe that can
00:46:50 do some shit too, hence the whole heiress dying thing, it was kind of important.
00:46:55 But everyone's like, oh no, no, no, now, see, it's a new thing, it's a remake, right?
00:47:00 It's a totally different story.
00:47:01 The new story is about changing fate.
00:47:05 Okay, well, for a moment I could put on my philosopher's hat, fate literally doesn't
00:47:10 exist in the real life.
00:47:11 So what am I supposed to learn?
00:47:13 What exactly is the point of this story?
00:47:17 There is none.
00:47:18 I mean, point of the story aside, as long as they are actually changing the theme.
00:47:23 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, because one theme is good, one theme is bad, changing fate,
00:47:29 he didn't fall in SE 13, it meant nothing, nothing happened.
00:47:32 The thing that's different though is that in the Gurren Lagann thing, the story is exactly
00:47:37 the same, they just saved people to make people happy.
00:47:40 Correct.
00:47:41 Even though like it diminishes some aspect of the tragedy, which is a good thing for
00:47:45 a story to have.
00:47:46 So that was annoying, but far less important than changing something like FF7's deaths,
00:47:50 which are integral to the point of the story.
00:47:52 Yeah, but that's my point, is that if they are actually changing the theme and the story,
00:47:57 then the deaths are not as important as before.
00:48:00 In theory, I see your point.
00:48:01 It's just that when you change it to a theme that I would argue is inherently vacuous and
00:48:06 has no narrative weight to it, or meaning, like this idea of changing fate means nothing.
00:48:13 It means nothing.
00:48:14 I don't know.
00:48:15 And the fact that the original game is cast as the bad ending, you see that fucking Red
00:48:21 13 clip?
00:48:22 Yeah.
00:48:23 What the fuck is that about?
00:48:24 I was gonna say that.
00:48:26 You know, I saw an interview with someone who was working on the remake, and he's like,
00:48:31 well, the original game ended with everyone in the whole world dying and there's no people
00:48:36 left.
00:48:37 That fucking kinkase that retarded dumbass motherfucker.
00:48:41 First of all, it was meant to be ambiguous, and second of all, it wasn't even that ambiguous
00:48:44 because you heard like the children laughing at the end or whatever.
00:48:48 So like it does imply that just Midgar has been abandoned and people are still living.
00:48:53 You know who I know?
00:48:54 I just would 100% know that nobody, the world was not wiped out.
00:48:58 It's because if humanity was wiped out by Holy, what the fuck did it matter that Eris
00:49:04 died and any of that should happen?
00:49:07 Why didn't just we let Sephiroth win if the livestream was just going to save everyone
00:49:11 anyway and humanity made no difference anyway?
00:49:14 They're like, of course everyone survived.
00:49:17 It would be literal bad ending of no narrative weight if everyone died.
00:49:21 Of course humanity wasn't wiped out by Holy.
00:49:24 That would be the most nihilistic interpretation possible about how life has no meaning.
00:49:29 And I refuse to believe that was the point of the story.
00:49:32 Just the attitude.
00:49:33 I mean like even them changing stuff and like having a new canon and kind of like a rebuild
00:49:40 sort of story from here on out, fine, whatever, you do you man, even that is fine.
00:49:46 But just the arrogant attitude, the audacity of saying, like basically directly saying
00:49:52 the old ending was bad, the old story was bad, the new one will be good.
00:49:58 Oh my god, I'm hearing people now saying, oh my god this made me want to fucking explode.
00:50:04 I heard people say the old end, straight up they said like fans are saying the old ending
00:50:08 let's be real guys, the old ending was pretty bad, it wasn't that good, we got to change
00:50:13 it up.
00:50:14 I didn't understand what happened, therefore it's bad.
00:50:18 How can you even try to- Literally, I'm hearing this.
00:50:21 How can you even try to bullshit people and say that the original ending was like objectively
00:50:26 the whole world, everyone died.
00:50:28 Did you forget your own fucking sequel where everyone was perfectly fine two years later?
00:50:35 I try to ignore the continuity of that but you know what another point I was thinking
00:50:39 about, you know how in the, it's said in Advent Children that like geostigma, like even putting
00:50:46 aside the fact that Advent Children in order to exist means that humans continue to live.
00:50:51 Okay, but what about geostigma, ooh the planet was mad at everybody, right?
00:50:54 That's why the planet infected everybody with geostigma, literally wrong.
00:50:58 It was literally just Genova cells polluting the life stream and at the end Eris and the
00:51:03 life stream come back to cure everyone because they're good and they're not bad and humanity
00:51:09 isn't evil and toxic.
00:51:11 The point of Final Fantasy 7 is not that humanity needs to die, that's like the attitude Barrett
00:51:16 had at the beginning that he grows out of over the course of the game.
00:51:23 Terrorism is not good, don't kill people for the greater good.
00:51:26 And it's also worth noting that a big part of that development for both Barrett and Tifa
00:51:32 is that Avalanche in its first incarnation in Midgar was a complete failure and got all
00:51:39 of Sector 7 killed.
00:51:40 That's kind of important, but now everyone in Sector 7 lives.
00:51:46 Who's gonna argue to me, Maximilian fucking dude, all you fucking people who think this
00:51:50 thing is like good writing, it's so obvious that it's just, they just want happy endings.
00:51:57 How can you not see that, have you not been paying attention to the stories these people
00:52:02 write?
00:52:03 There is no 10,000 degree chess going on here, how can you not see that?
00:52:08 Maybe it's because you are invited to every Square Enix developer meetup and they tell
00:52:12 you like wow, your fucking videos influence me so much, they motivate me to keep making
00:52:17 the game.
00:52:18 Maybe that's corrupted your view of the game a little bit, I don't know.
00:52:22 And it already had a happy ending without being schmaltzier stupid about it.
00:52:27 When they say that the ending was bad, it's not that the ending was like sad, it's just
00:52:34 that it wasn't overly schmaltzier, the ending was tasteful of Final Fantasy 7.
00:52:39 It was just like, you know, cloud like sort of like overcame his anxieties and overcame
00:52:44 his trauma and he beat Sephiroth in a battle of wills.
00:52:47 They saved the planet, Eris's little holy spell got to do its thing, the planet did
00:52:52 its thing and they go oh, will it kill us too?
00:52:56 Are we just as bad?
00:52:57 Who knows?
00:52:58 But then everyone, and you know, it's just, it's tasteful is my point.
00:53:02 It just goes to show you cannot trust people to formulate a fucking coherent thought based
00:53:08 on the narratives of a fucking story or they'll just fuck it up.
00:53:14 They'll just not understand what has been, what was the point of Final Fantasy 7, do
00:53:19 all this stuff so that everyone dies at the end?
00:53:23 Do you think that was the point of the story, boys and girls?
00:53:26 I'm telling you the answer's no.
00:53:28 The answer is no to that question.
00:53:30 I mean, yeah, didn't Sakaguchi say a long time ago that he made the game, the whole
00:53:36 concept of the story was his way of like dealing with grief because like his mother had died
00:53:40 or something and like, and like moving on, like the story is about moving on and like
00:53:46 it's about life, it's not about death and nihilism and the whole world.
00:53:50 You want to talk about moving on?
00:53:51 How about we bring back everybody that died?
00:53:54 How's that for moving on?
00:53:55 That's not what I like.
00:53:56 Man, that's not what I was going to do.
00:53:58 You did it.
00:53:59 Oh, I hate Zak.
00:54:03 He sucks.
00:54:04 Zak?
00:54:05 I want him to die.
00:54:06 Is the most...
00:54:07 I mean, I want him to die again.
00:54:08 Why is everyone into Zak?
00:54:09 I don't understand.
00:54:10 I'm sorry I'm yelling so much, everyone.
00:54:12 I just got a lot.
00:54:13 I mean, like, I know that he died to begin with, but I mean, I want the concept of Zak
00:54:17 to die and go away.
00:54:20 People just get attached to characters because why?
00:54:24 Because they're nice.
00:54:25 Why?
00:54:26 Because they were eight years old when Crisis Core came out.
00:54:29 And so to them, that's the end all be all of the series and that's good.
00:54:34 They think...
00:54:35 Can you believe that?
00:54:36 People tell me.
00:54:37 Crisis Core is good.
00:54:39 People tell me that like, you know, oh, you know, you like the original, oh, spin-offs
00:54:42 don't matter, man.
00:54:43 Like, what does spin-offs matter?
00:54:45 Like, why are you mad?
00:54:46 It's just a spin-off.
00:54:47 It's not like it's fucking with the original game, bro.
00:54:49 It's not like, look where we're at now.
00:54:53 Look who we have to deal with.
00:54:55 Because this virus has been allowed to spread.
00:54:59 This is Genova polluting the life stream of the public consciousness of this fucking
00:55:03 game and everyone's thinking wrong things because they weren't in the original because
00:55:08 Sakaguchi has left the fucking building.
00:55:11 I'm not even trying to say Sakaguchi was like an angel and everything good left with him.
00:55:15 It's just that the atmosphere that created the original is gone and we've got something
00:55:20 else.
00:55:21 And I don't like it.
00:55:22 It's a totally different company at this point internally.
00:55:26 Fuck, what was I just going to say?
00:55:28 Something about Zack's sucking.
00:55:29 Oh, yeah.
00:55:30 There was one part, Hojo, at one part of the game, he said the letter G. He said G and
00:55:42 I had an ulcer.
00:55:43 I coughed up blood.
00:55:44 He specifically said, oh, oh, these soldiers, they're G types, not S types.
00:55:50 Oh, yeah.
00:55:51 Oh, yeah.
00:55:52 And I went, there was blood all over my, gacked his back, baby.
00:55:57 Oh, I gacked.
00:55:58 All right.
00:55:59 I fucking, did you, did you enjoy the scene?
00:56:03 Why, what the fuck is the, why would Hojo just say when he meets cloud, oh, I know you,
00:56:09 you literally weren't a soldier.
00:56:10 Oh, yeah.
00:56:11 And then the time Janney's carry him away after he says it.
00:56:15 Why not before?
00:56:16 It makes, if you're trying to preserve the timeline, makes no sense because like the,
00:56:21 the idea is that they come and they, they, they prevent people from changing Destiny's
00:56:29 course.
00:56:30 They, anytime that a character deviates from what already happened, it does something different.
00:56:34 The time janitors show up and stop it.
00:56:37 Okay.
00:56:38 How are they deviating in the first place then?
00:56:41 I've been wondering that.
00:56:42 Like the, the answer has to be either Sephiroth is doing something with time shenanigans.
00:56:48 That would, okay.
00:56:49 Okay.
00:56:50 Why did Hojo do something different?
00:56:52 Why did cloud try to kill Reno this time?
00:56:55 I have been lacking my fucking brain.
00:56:57 Look, we, people, people are going to ask for 10,000 IQ plays.
00:57:02 The answer is these people are terrible writers and they don't know what they're doing.
00:57:06 That's the answer to the question.
00:57:08 You can spend all day searching the stars for the fucking, what does it mean, bro?
00:57:13 What are the implications of this?
00:57:15 None of it's there.
00:57:16 There is no substance beneath any of this.
00:57:18 The answer is they don't know what they're doing and they're fucking everything up.
00:57:22 I love how they're supposed to like preserve the timeline as it was.
00:57:28 As if it's not going to significantly alter the timeline to have everyone in sector seven
00:57:33 see a giant swirling tornado of cloaked grim reapers around the bar.
00:57:37 Like that's not going to alter anyone's lives that they saw that shit.
00:57:42 Okay.
00:57:43 Like they, Barrett gets stabbed by Sephiroth, right?
00:57:46 And the time Jenny somehow brings him back or what?
00:57:51 Yeah.
00:57:52 You know, I almost thought for the briefest of moments, oh my God, they're doing something
00:57:58 different and interesting and unique.
00:58:00 And I can't believe this happening.
00:58:01 I'm actually surprised they're killing Barrett in the first game.
00:58:04 Oh my God.
00:58:05 I can't believe.
00:58:06 Oh, no, no, they're not.
00:58:07 And I don't want to hear you fucking people being all like, did you guys know that they
00:58:09 were originally going to kill Barrett and like the whole crew?
00:58:12 Yes.
00:58:13 I've read the interviews.
00:58:14 I know that they were planning to kill the entire rest of the cast, except Cloud and
00:58:17 then Nomura talked them out of it.
00:58:19 Do not quote the ancient knowledge to me.
00:58:21 I was there when it was written.
00:58:23 Yeah, indeed.
00:58:24 Indeed.
00:58:25 It's just the time Jannies, man.
00:58:28 They save Barrett, but isn't it kind of important to preserve the timeline that Cloud not know
00:58:34 that he's a soldier or that he was in fact not ever a soldier, but he just hears that
00:58:40 from Hojo.
00:58:41 Shouldn't like an appropriate correlate wouldn't be like, okay, Barrett dies and then the time
00:58:46 Jannies restore him.
00:58:47 Wouldn't an appropriate correlate be like Cloud hears he was never a soldier from Hojo,
00:58:51 which he does.
00:58:52 And then the time Jannies like go into his head and like remove that vital piece of lore.
00:58:57 Instead, Hojo just tells him and he goes, oh crap, oh, well, I'll just pretend I didn't
00:59:01 hear that.
00:59:02 It's treated like he doesn't even consider it or think about it, even though that's the
00:59:08 biggest reveal in the entire game at the, during the fucking Cloud's interest.
00:59:15 You know what?
00:59:16 I just, I don't understand why people think this is so good, I am so confused.
00:59:20 This entire third act of the game, I mean, you know, the one good thing about it could
00:59:28 have been that people who didn't get a chance to play it the first time could experience
00:59:32 the story.
00:59:33 If you didn't play Final Fantasy 7, you would have no fucking idea what is going on.
00:59:38 Sephiroth is not explained, Cloud's backstory is not explained, and the calm flashback is
00:59:43 the next thing that happens narratively, so they could have like somehow done it there
00:59:48 and put Sephiroth after that or something.
00:59:50 Yeah, you know, I almost, like I was thinking, the whole game I was thinking, oh, I bet I
00:59:54 know what they're going to do.
00:59:55 They're telling everyone it's just Midgar, but they're going to go a little bit farther
00:59:58 and go to calm so that we can do the flashback and that's where it'll end.
01:00:01 That would make sense.
01:00:02 But like I thought for sure, surely that is the thing that makes sense narratively for
01:00:07 the structure of this game, but no, they didn't even think of that.
01:00:10 In my video years ago, I asked, I think the important question, who is this for?
01:00:16 And I think I have the answer and I think it's basically that like Square Enix, they
01:00:20 think everyone in the world has played Final Fantasy 7 and not only that, but has memorized
01:00:27 every story beat.
01:00:28 So they feel they can't do it again.
01:00:31 They feel that like, they feel like watching the comparison of like Jaws or whatever.
01:00:35 Oh, watching Jaws again, it's not like the pacing and all the subtle hints of the shark's
01:00:41 body and whatever.
01:00:42 That doesn't matter.
01:00:43 The fact that you know there's a shark and you know every story beat means no one would
01:00:46 enjoy watching that again.
01:00:47 So you can't remake it or whatever the fuck.
01:00:49 They...
01:00:50 Who do you think Sephiroth is if you're a new player?
01:00:54 Like I can't wrap my head around like how baffled you must be.
01:00:59 He's a guy.
01:01:00 That's all I think.
01:01:01 He's a guy.
01:01:02 Sephiroth is just this guy, you know?
01:01:04 He's just a guy and he's pretty, pretty badass I guess, but maybe he's gay?
01:01:11 I don't know.
01:01:12 He just seems gay.
01:01:13 He's definitely pretty gay.
01:01:15 I don't know when that happened, when that change occurred, but at some point he did
01:01:18 definitely catch the gay.
01:01:20 Sephiroth is just like sitting in the back of that truck in the column flashback with
01:01:25 Cloud just like doing squats and Cloud's like, oh, I can't wait to try my new materia.
01:01:29 And Sephiroth just says, doesn't I shall give you despair.
01:01:32 He just says, what a green rookie, look at this rookie over here.
01:01:36 He's just like a dude, man.
01:01:37 He's just like a soldier who fought in wars, which by the way is still going on.
01:01:42 Wutai is not a tourist town as famously sung by Jesse in the Shinobi rap.
01:01:48 It's in fact, you know, a powerhouse.
01:01:50 Oh god, why are they changing things like this?
01:01:53 Sick, sick, deep cut.
01:01:54 That matters for Yuffie's backstory.
01:01:56 Yeah, exactly.
01:01:58 They should have just used my Shinobi rap as the template for this story because I told
01:02:04 them what to do and how to do it.
01:02:07 You know, I was very scared when they did the angel of the slum side missions.
01:02:11 I was sure that it was going to be Yuffie and I was like, oh no, what are you doing?
01:02:16 Thankfully it wasn't.
01:02:17 That was the one thing where they showed restraint.
01:02:20 They have that one girl who is like literally Yuffie basically, but she is, I looked it
01:02:25 up.
01:02:26 Not read the spin-off novel, whatever the fuck it is.
01:02:30 She's from a novel, boys.
01:02:33 So remember that guy working for Don Corneo, Leslie, he's also from the novel.
01:02:40 You know, he was like the one new character that I didn't hate completely.
01:02:43 I didn't hate him at first, but then the side mission just kind of dragged with him and
01:02:47 I was like, I get it, obviously this happened to you.
01:02:50 So obviously terrible anime writing.
01:02:52 But then he got to the part where he like stupidly monologued instead of shooting Corneo
01:02:57 and totally got fucked like an idiot.
01:03:01 I did like seeing Corneo cuck that guy and I was like, oh, Corneo actually did something
01:03:05 cool.
01:03:06 Yeah, good work.
01:03:07 I like that.
01:03:08 This is how he became a mob boss in the first place or whatever.
01:03:11 Yeah, so yeah, if you're a new player and you beat the game and you see this guy with
01:03:19 black hair and he's like walking past Eris and is doing all this like melodramatic sad
01:03:25 shit with this guy that you've never seen before.
01:03:28 You have no context for who this is whatsoever.
01:03:31 Like what are you thinking?
01:03:32 Like they think everyone knows who all these characters, they put themselves like, man,
01:03:39 you want to talk about like, you know, you know, if you're, Tom, you can relate to this.
01:03:42 In the past, when I've been making like games and I personally have designed games as a developer,
01:03:48 you spend like tens, hundreds of fucking hours, thousands of hours like working on like level
01:03:53 design and things.
01:03:54 There are puzzles, for example, that you implement into a game that you can solve because first
01:04:00 of all, you know things about how the game is designed and even more than that, you have
01:04:04 developed skills far beyond what like an average player might have.
01:04:08 It's like Square Enix is approaching this game design thinking like, like from within
01:04:12 that box, like, oh, everyone knows every aspect of this game and like every beat of the story.
01:04:19 Even though you think how many people love replaying Final Fantasy 7 once in a while
01:04:24 to just be like, oh my God, I forgot how good the atmosphere was here.
01:04:27 I forgot how good the like, you know, Reno's appearance was here and like the Midgar's
01:04:32 Alarm scene and the fucking, I don't know, meaning sang in the Mithril Caves and everything
01:04:36 about Rocket Town, you forget these little details, but they just assume you have everything
01:04:40 in your fucking brain and there's no point in being coy about any detail, even when it
01:04:46 was like the point of the narrative, the way you like subtly present Sephiroth throughout
01:04:51 the game, because spoilers, it's not even Sephiroth until the end of the fucking game
01:04:55 in Northern Crater.
01:04:58 Why did they make the motorcycle chase not fun this time?
01:05:03 I don't know, why did they make it bad?
01:05:08 I'm not going to lie, like I always love the original, you know, it was kind of hard.
01:05:11 I mean, I like the original, I just had a fun arcadey simplicity to it and now there's
01:05:16 a boss battle involved where you got to hit the guy's tires.
01:05:19 I did not like that boss battle.
01:05:21 That was one of the like, the two times I died in the game against that boss the first
01:05:24 time.
01:05:25 Yeah, I guess we'll give everyone else in the show a chance to talk now.
01:05:29 I guess we've...
01:05:30 Sorry guys.
01:05:32 One more thing.
01:05:33 It's cool that we just did Final Fantasy VII podcast remake.
01:05:37 We've remade the podcast about Final Fantasy VII.
01:05:39 Yeah, well, I had to redeem myself for erroneously calling it phenomenal the last time I was
01:05:45 on, because I was only five hours into the game then, and like immediately after that
01:05:49 point it fucking spiraled down into oblivion, into the exact same hell I knew it would,
01:05:55 but I was briefly lulled into complacency when I saw the graphics, I guess, and I was
01:06:00 like, ooh, this is nice though, I kind of like it, oh what a fool I was to have been positive
01:06:05 even slightly.
01:06:06 When I listen...
01:06:07 No, I don't care.
01:06:08 You know, the Genova fight, which by the way wasn't the original or whatever, who fucking
01:06:11 cares, there's a new Genova fight in Shinra HQ, we are also transformed into like a dream
01:06:15 dimension, okay, whatever, that's fine.
01:06:17 I mean, the Genova theme that plays there and like the phase that goes through and that
01:06:21 whole boss fight was kind of like my favorite part of the whole game, like you're playing
01:06:25 a video game, it's not like a cutscene, of course.
01:06:28 They do cuck you by doing the phase transitions where you lose your stagger bar and you have
01:06:32 to restart, so that's always fucking...
01:06:34 Oh yeah, the whole entire combat system is bad and sucks, let's talk about that now
01:06:38 for the next fucking hour.
01:06:40 It's the worst.
01:06:42 Once I got into the rhythm, I enjoy it, I do like it.
01:06:46 I kind of the same way I enjoy Final Fantasy XIII, it's very similar to Final Fantasy XIII.
01:06:49 It works really well when you're just fighting regular enemies, but like every boss battle
01:06:54 has some weird gimmick or some other stupid thing you've got to keep track of and also
01:06:58 the bosses are too large so the camera doesn't know what to do and the AI for your companions
01:07:04 is like the worst I've ever seen in a video game, I can't believe that this is in Final
01:07:08 Fantasy VII.
01:07:09 I mean, I guess that's kind of the idea to micromanage your party, but like, it's annoying
01:07:14 and dumb.
01:07:15 It's uncomfortable mixing though.
01:07:16 And Final Fantasy XII, which came out like 15 years ago, had the gambit system and it
01:07:21 worked beautifully, you could make sure that you knew exactly what your AI companions were
01:07:25 doing at all times.
01:07:26 Why didn't Square make that system?
01:07:29 Why didn't they just bring it over here?
01:07:31 The first thing I did once I figured out how the controls work, I know you have command
01:07:35 shortcuts, you can hold like, it's like Kingdom Art style, you can map moves.
01:07:38 The shortcuts are helpful.
01:07:39 The first thing I did once I figured that out was like, oh, I hate going into the menu,
01:07:43 thank God they put a system where I have to spend as little time in the menu as possible
01:07:46 because it's a really uncomfortable mix of having to stop things every two seconds to
01:07:51 choose the command or whatever.
01:07:52 I didn't mind the menus too much because I liked being able to just pause and pick targets,
01:07:59 especially when you're fighting multiple guys to make sure your hit goes to exactly who
01:08:03 you want it to go to.
01:08:05 So that was okay because it was kind of like the power wheel in Mass Effect or something.
01:08:10 You slow things down, you can tactically choose targets and stuff.
01:08:13 It was kind of similar to that.
01:08:15 I just don't understand why they even bothered with any of the real-time elements at all
01:08:19 because it was so not substantial in any way, shape, or form, you know?
01:08:25 We talked about the dodge.
01:08:27 The dodge is a true nightmare.
01:08:28 It's so bad.
01:08:29 I did a vlog on this game and I don't even know if I'm going to release it because I
01:08:33 just shit on the game and I just don't want to pile on with everybody else.
01:08:39 But it's like, the combat lacks the kind of like frenetic, reflexive nature or something
01:08:45 like Devil May Cry, but it also-
01:08:46 By the way, Tom, if you need permission, I give you my seal of approval.
01:08:50 I'm sure you do.
01:08:52 There is too much positivity about this game going on.
01:08:55 They need sober cold water.
01:08:56 Okay, I'm sorry.
01:08:57 But it lacks that kind of reflexive nature of something like a DMC, like a traditional
01:09:02 action game, but it also lacks the intentional tactility of something like a Souls game.
01:09:09 It's just like-
01:09:10 Nice term, bro.
01:09:13 It's just a turn-based RPG with tacked on movement because they were just like, people
01:09:19 these days are not going to be able to watch a bar fill up, so we got to make them actively
01:09:23 fill the bar.
01:09:24 And that's all it is.
01:09:25 It's so slow.
01:09:26 The ATB is so slow and the enemies have way too much hit points.
01:09:29 And the fucking, God, the barrier is broken in this.
01:09:36 It's totally so obnoxious and annoying because barrier like halves your physical attacks
01:09:41 and that's fine.
01:09:42 And in the old system, that was fine.
01:09:44 It wasn't too annoying, you know?
01:09:46 But in this one, anytime like an enemy is blocking or has a barrier, you have that feeling
01:09:51 of like your sword clunking off of them and like stopping you dead in your tracks.
01:09:55 It's so irritating.
01:09:56 That's the word.
01:09:57 Infuriating.
01:09:58 Did you guys-
01:09:59 Against the house.
01:10:00 Against the fucking house.
01:10:01 That happened constantly.
01:10:02 Yeah.
01:10:03 That was horrible.
01:10:04 You just, I don't, I didn't die against the house actually like was able to beat it,
01:10:08 but it was just like annoying and slow.
01:10:10 And it's just like, if it was just doing half damage and I was still attacking, like that
01:10:14 would be one thing, but it just completely ruins the flow that they're trying to build.
01:10:18 Another thing that's really annoying-
01:10:19 Can't build ATB either.
01:10:20 With the boss fights, like some of them have like certain like attackable weak points,
01:10:25 like the mechs and stuff, you can like blow off their arms and shit like that.
01:10:28 But like, it doesn't work because the attacks are so clunky, you'll try and hit an arm,
01:10:33 but you'll just end up hitting the body.
01:10:35 Like even in the first boss battle, where you have to attack the shield generator, like
01:10:39 half the time you're not even hitting it because like it's such a tiny target buried in the
01:10:44 back of the boss and you'll just end up hitting the body.
01:10:47 And because you have no control over the camera with the way it's set up too, it makes it
01:10:50 really hard to get in the right position.
01:10:51 The worst thing is that there are no iframes for anything, how many times have you like
01:10:59 lost your limit break because you get hit by something from off screen while you're
01:11:04 charging up your limit break?
01:11:05 How do you fuck that up?
01:11:07 That's 101!
01:11:08 How do you charge up my iframes?
01:11:09 What is the point of a Dark Souls dodge roll without the Dark Souls invincibility frames,
01:11:13 which is the whole point of the dodge roll in the first place.
01:11:15 It doesn't fucking function as a dodge roll.
01:11:17 It's just for basic repositioning for charge ups on boss attacks.
01:11:21 And it's just, it doesn't, it's so fucking shit.
01:11:24 Just because like the actual like sensation when you connect with something, when like
01:11:30 you do a braver and it connects, it feels fucking awesome.
01:11:33 When you do the triangle shot with Barrett and that final charge hit, it feels amazing.
01:11:38 Just make it be turn based so I can have this catharsis hits that works every time.
01:11:42 It takes so long to build up the ATP gauge and then you go to do something and it gets
01:11:46 interrupted and you go right back to square one and you have to do it all over again.
01:11:51 You know what is my, I think I'm probably the most positive of any of us about the
01:11:56 battle system because I do like it in many ways, but I obviously have many grievances.
01:12:00 And my number one, the most annoying thing is that when battle ends, your limit gauge
01:12:05 gets reset.
01:12:07 I must have played through the majority of the game using my limit break like three times
01:12:12 and only with cloud because you just don't get a fucking chance to build it up in a fucking
01:12:18 battle before.
01:12:19 Oh god.
01:12:20 I'm sorry.
01:12:21 The more I just can't stop talking about all the bad things, why, why, why, okay.
01:12:30 Why does the right stick control the camera and the lock on?
01:12:33 Yeah, it's unfortunate.
01:12:36 Locking on does not feel like it even works half the time and then you're constantly switching
01:12:41 when you don't mean to because you're trying to get the camera back where it goes.
01:12:46 There's issues.
01:12:49 There's issues.
01:12:50 Fuck it.
01:12:51 You know what the thing is, this idea that like an action combat system is like inherently
01:12:59 better and more tactile or whatever than the old turn based system, like the old turn
01:13:05 based system in Final Fantasy 7 felt snappier and more responsive and quicker than this
01:13:12 limp-wristed like half and half abomination that is like sitting in the middle between
01:13:17 turn based and real time, you know what I'm saying here?
01:13:20 Yeah, I was flipping shit on Twitter when I first started playing the same because I
01:13:24 just thought the combat was so bad and everyone was like, oh no, it's fucking good.
01:13:28 I just knew it's different.
01:13:29 They're going to try and experiment with shit.
01:13:31 I'm just like, but look, you put a dodge in the game, but everybody in the beginning
01:13:38 of the game has guns and they follow you when you dodge roll.
01:13:43 So there is no way to dodge the bullets that everyone is shooting at you in the beginning
01:13:47 of the game.
01:13:48 So the dodge is fucking useless.
01:13:51 How about instead of a useless dodge that doesn't work, how about instead of that you
01:13:55 have a fucking jump button so it's not infuriatingly annoying to fight any flying enemy in the game.
01:14:01 That's not good.
01:14:02 Flying enemies.
01:14:03 It's so bad.
01:14:04 Give me death.
01:14:05 Yeah, you have to switch the barret for that.
01:14:07 You just, there's no.
01:14:08 Yeah, you have to.
01:14:09 You have to.
01:14:10 When it comes to the, when it comes to the dodge, by the way, look, I could accept no
01:14:14 iframes, but what you just need to do is not give me a full like two second cooldown and
01:14:19 give me a bit more fucking distance on the dodge because they're so short and so much
01:14:24 cooler when you dodge.
01:14:25 The dodge is useless in the first boss fight when it does that charge up like electricity
01:14:29 AOE thing and you're like, oh, I got a dodge out of here.
01:14:31 You can't dodge far enough to avoid it so you get hit every fucking time.
01:14:36 It's just so badly designed and I don't like it and it's dumb and gay and shit and fuck.
01:14:42 You know, I've had a lot of fun with like side missions doing battles, but like the side
01:14:48 mission battles are okay because it works when you fight like mobs and ads and like regular
01:14:53 just enemies because you can like the damage output on your normal attacks is basically
01:14:59 nothing compared to, you know, the ATB attacks and yeah, but, but that small amount of damage
01:15:05 is enough to cut through like normal guys running around like on side quests and stuff.
01:15:08 You can play it essentially like an action game and when you're fighting melee guys
01:15:12 physically getting out of the way with the dodge role allows you to dodge attacks.
01:15:17 But anytime there's projectiles involved, you can't dodge them.
01:15:21 They're taking hits, especially with bosses firing like multiple missiles at the same time.
01:15:25 Our arena just turns into a death trap.
01:15:27 I guess.
01:15:28 Yeah.
01:15:29 I think all you do is block.
01:15:30 I don't know.
01:15:31 But the regular attacks once you're fighting bosses or like even like more of the stronger
01:15:37 enemies are essentially useless because like they have like 20 or 30,000 HP and it's like,
01:15:42 oh, I'm hitting them for 15.
01:15:44 Awesome.
01:15:45 Like it's just to fill the ATV gauge and it's just dumb and it's wasting my time.
01:15:49 It's about the stag bar.
01:15:50 Just be turn-based.
01:15:51 Just be turn-based.
01:15:52 It'll be...
01:15:53 I don't know.
01:15:56 You know, that whole boss fight with the house, I know that everyone thinks it's so cool that
01:16:01 the house is back and everyone is praising that fight.
01:16:05 You know, I hate to give Super Eye Patch Wolf credit because I am deeply jealous of his
01:16:09 meteoric success, but he brought up a great point in his Final Fantasy 7 video a couple
01:16:15 months ago where he sort of went into the house and how it's kind of a really cool design
01:16:23 that in the slums where everyone is like poverty-ridden and has no homes, that like a monster would
01:16:29 evolve to look like a house, to lure homeless people in, like that's the idea of the house.
01:16:34 And like that is clearly the idea that they were going for.
01:16:37 It is a monster that camouflages itself as a house to eat homeless people.
01:16:42 That is...
01:16:43 It goes with the themes of the game.
01:16:44 The themes of the game are like poverty and class and all that.
01:16:48 It's not that anymore.
01:16:49 It's just a robot monster that Corneo keeps in his stadium for some reason.
01:16:54 That's dumb.
01:16:55 That's not good anymore.
01:16:56 Also...
01:16:57 Okay, that's the interesting you bring that up because as someone who didn't play the
01:17:00 original, I'm like, why would you make a robot house?
01:17:03 It made no fucking sense to me.
01:17:05 They put it in that part for fanservice without thinking of why he was in the original game
01:17:09 and where he belonged in the game in the first place.
01:17:13 How about that part where you're for fucking Hojo just stops the entire game and makes
01:17:18 you switch parties like 50 times for like 4 hours, flipping switches, having to switch
01:17:23 the materia back and forth every single time you switch?
01:17:26 Oh yeah.
01:17:27 As soon as I realized that I was like, I need 4 of every materia immediately so I never
01:17:32 need to switch with anyone.
01:17:34 Yeah.
01:17:35 Yeah.
01:17:36 That's life.
01:17:37 That's life.
01:17:38 But man, it's really fucking cool when you use it.
01:17:44 And you hit three guys.
01:17:46 Oh man, it feels so fucking good.
01:17:47 Triple slash is so cool.
01:17:49 Triple slash is so fun.
01:17:50 I love it.
01:17:51 Yeah, that's the best part of the game.
01:17:52 It's triple slash.
01:17:53 It's the part I like about it.
01:17:55 Every time I use triple slash, I'm like, maybe I'll play it a little bit more.
01:17:58 Yeah.
01:17:59 Triple slash is pretty good.
01:18:01 I like Counter Strike.
01:18:02 Oh my god.
01:18:03 All of Tifa's moves are so cool.
01:18:05 It's so fun to play as Tifa.
01:18:06 You know what they didn't mention?
01:18:07 And I found out on the forums, or on a forum looking it up, you know how you switch to
01:18:12 Punisher mode with cloud and you hold down block and you'll counter?
01:18:16 Did you know?
01:18:17 Yeah.
01:18:18 Wait, is that true?
01:18:19 I didn't know that.
01:18:20 It automatically counters by holding down, you hold down guard.
01:18:21 He'll automatically do a counter.
01:18:23 What?
01:18:24 But someone said in the forums, and I mentioned it on Twitter and nobody knew.
01:18:27 If you tap triangle right when an attack hits you, you counter even in operator mode.
01:18:32 What?
01:18:33 I heard somebody say that.
01:18:34 I saw some, like, let's play or doing that.
01:18:37 This is not explained anywhere.
01:18:39 Yeah.
01:18:40 And I'm like, oh, there's a little bit of depth here.
01:18:43 There's a little bit of depth now.
01:18:45 If you time your things right, you can just counter everything with cloud and that's fucking
01:18:49 cool.
01:18:50 Well, you're not going to counter all those fucking rockets that the fucking house launches
01:18:56 at you or anything.
01:18:57 Fuck that.
01:18:58 Yeah.
01:18:59 I don't know.
01:19:00 I don't know.
01:19:01 I don't know.
01:19:02 I don't know.
01:19:03 All right, I have one more thing to say and then I'll be done.
01:19:04 Okay.
01:19:05 Okay.
01:19:07 So you know that Sephiroth theme that goes like, those chosen by the planet, I believe?
01:19:17 Yes.
01:19:18 Yes.
01:19:19 So right at the end of the game where you're in that little threshold and Sephiroth says,
01:19:23 hey, cloud, if you go through here, it's the end of the game and we'll have a final
01:19:25 boss fight.
01:19:26 Yeah.
01:19:27 So go to the vending machine and shop first, buddy.
01:19:30 I'm Sephiroth and I'm evil.
01:19:32 Go shop at the vending machine, buddy.
01:19:34 This is a video game and none of it matters.
01:19:36 Yeah.
01:19:37 That part where you're waiting at the threshold and it's playing that music.
01:19:41 You know, I didn't want to go into it right away.
01:19:43 I was kind of hungry.
01:19:44 I was kind of peckish.
01:19:45 I went out into the kitchen and there was some leftover asparagus from Dindin.
01:19:51 And so I just started eating asparagus and I just started shoveling this asparagus in
01:19:56 my face and just going mad with power, just ripping into this asparagus.
01:20:02 And in the background, the song was playing and I'm eating this asparagus like a dinosaur.
01:20:09 And then I just start going and I think you'd appreciate this, Nate.
01:20:12 I just started going, eat your greens.
01:20:15 Eat your greens.
01:20:17 All right.
01:20:19 I'm done.
01:20:21 I'm finished.
01:20:23 Yeah.
01:20:24 All right.
01:20:25 That's all.
01:20:26 That's all.
01:20:27 That's all.
01:20:28 That's all.
01:20:29 That's all.
01:20:30 That's all.
01:20:31 I'm finished.
01:20:32 I'm done.
01:20:33 You're done.
01:20:34 I don't want to go to him at all.
01:20:35 Wait.
01:20:36 What?
01:20:37 No.
01:20:38 They can't just be the Final Fantasy fan cafe.
01:20:39 Why not?
01:20:40 It could.
01:20:41 I mean, what else?
01:20:42 Does anything else interesting happened?
01:20:44 No.
01:20:45 Oh, I hate Factorio.
01:20:46 It's too mean to me.
01:20:47 Factorio is not even a real game.
01:20:48 I don't even believe it.
01:20:50 What happens to him?
01:20:51 Yeah, that in the world, Kim Jong-un is probably dead at LeMell.
01:20:54 That school...
01:20:55 Oh, yeah.
01:20:56 And we could all worship his yes, queen and sister.
01:20:58 Yeah.
01:20:59 We can finally start simping for North Korea.
01:21:00 Ooh, yeah, at last.
01:21:02 Pretty sick.
01:21:03 Yeah, pretty good.
01:21:04 Yeah, you're right.
01:21:05 There's nothing.
01:21:06 This is going to Christmas.
01:21:09 All right, fuck it.
01:21:10 I got them right here, boys.
01:21:12 We've only got three.
01:21:13 We have a lowly three.
01:21:14 Wait, we're really doing it?
01:21:16 That's really it?
01:21:17 I'm fine with this though.
01:21:18 I got no objections.
01:21:19 I thought for sure.
01:21:20 Well, Ben, clean, baby.
01:21:21 Do you have nothing to say?
01:21:22 What the fuck do I have to say?
01:21:23 No, I don't have anything to say.
01:21:25 I just, I hate my life, and I hate quarantine, and I'm really depressed, and everything sucks.
01:21:29 I agree with all that, yeah.
01:21:30 And here I am, and I'm on the show.
01:21:32 Why not play a beautiful new remake of your favorite game, Ben?
01:21:35 And I come on the show, and then I hear all about this Final Fantasy VII remake bullshit,
01:21:39 and you think that's doing anything for me?
01:21:41 No, dude.
01:21:42 But no.
01:21:43 I'm sorry, bro.
01:21:44 I don't want to spread misery.
01:21:46 I do not want to do that.
01:21:47 Well, how's your animal crossing?
01:21:49 Fine.
01:21:50 I got more roses.
01:21:51 Yeah.
01:21:52 Hey, play the fucking jingle, I guess.
01:21:54 Show my rose garden.
01:21:55 I got like 25.
01:21:56 I don't think we got a jingle yet.
01:21:57 Pretty cool.
01:21:58 Did anyone make a jingle?
01:21:59 Were there no voicemails that were someone submitting a fucking rose jingle?
01:22:03 Ugh.
01:22:04 I don't think so, guys.
01:22:06 Okay, but we need to come up with topics that make Ben feel less sad.
01:22:10 We got a brainstorm.
01:22:11 We got to cheer up Ben.
01:22:12 Wow.
01:22:13 Yeah, it's got to, you got to, you got to eat or me.
01:22:16 It's like that episode, yeah.
01:22:17 Yeah, you are going to stick it too.
01:22:19 You got to stuff honey in my mouth, and tie balloons to all my limbs, and I don't know.
01:22:25 Well, so they do fucking like, shoot him.
01:22:28 I don't remember.
01:22:29 Shoot him with a gun.
01:22:30 Put him down.
01:22:31 Yeah.
01:22:32 He can't be sad if he's dead.
01:22:35 Ugh, it's true.
01:22:36 Oh, we're all going to die, guys.
01:22:38 We're all going to die.
01:22:39 It won't even be long.
01:22:40 Yeah, but Final Fantasy 7 teaches us that we can have meaning in the real world even
01:22:44 afterwards.
01:22:45 No, once we're gone, that's it.
01:22:46 You don't remember anything that happened and none of it matters.
01:22:49 But the remake teaches us you won't actually die.
01:22:52 Yeah.
01:22:53 Yeah.
01:22:54 No, it's not real.
01:22:55 You definitely really just die, and then there's nothing.
01:22:57 Cool.
01:22:58 Well, then what was the point of the remake?
01:23:00 What's the remake trying to tell you?
01:23:01 Well, I guess what's the point of life at all?
01:23:03 Maybe nihilism is correct, so maybe the remake is correct.
01:23:06 Oh, no.
01:23:07 It's way more accurate.
01:23:08 Yeah, you know what?
01:23:09 I guess I stand the remake now, because that's what it's like.
01:23:12 It's way more relevant to my real life experience.
01:23:15 Nothing means anything.
01:23:17 Consume, consume, consume.
01:23:19 Don't ask questions, just consume.
01:23:21 You know, at least it's on.
01:23:23 At least it's on.
01:23:24 At least it's on.
01:23:25 No, it's not on.
01:23:26 It's to call itself a remake, and it tells me shit on me.
01:23:29 They're remaking the plot note as well.
01:23:31 That's all.
01:23:33 Do you guys put any credence in?
01:23:35 Okay, let's say.
01:23:36 Okay, no more.
01:23:37 Oh, God, I brought it back.
01:23:38 Oh, fuck.
01:23:39 All right, damn it.
01:23:40 I just think this is an epic meme.
01:23:43 No, it's not epic.
01:23:44 It's not epic.
01:23:45 It's not a meme.
01:23:46 It's not funny.
01:23:47 You need to die.
01:23:48 You need to die, mate.
01:23:49 I'm Japanese.
01:23:50 I'm Japanese.
01:23:51 I can use English words, and they mean whatever I want them to me, because I'm not English.
01:23:56 Is this a legitimate legal defense with this pass and a court of law?
01:24:00 Yes.
01:24:01 Oh, it was actually Final Fantasy VII, Lee Make, not Remake.
01:24:05 No, it was actually Final Fantasy V, Remake.
01:24:09 Like those were not neuromanumeral.
01:24:11 It's Lee Make, not only because they can't pronounce R's, but because they give him some
01:24:16 Lee Way in the remake.
01:24:18 It's Final Fantasy VII, Remake.
01:24:23 It sure is.
01:24:24 It is to me.
01:24:25 It is to me.
01:24:26 That's the title of this episode.
01:24:28 Speaking of...
01:24:29 Yeah, that makes sense.
01:24:31 Hey, look at this.
01:24:32 I commissioned Kazi to draw my slime girl from Radiforce's Cop Killers.
01:24:37 That's pretty cool.
01:24:38 Not bad.
01:24:39 Not bad.
01:24:40 I like it.
01:24:41 I'll just be distracted by it.
01:24:42 I posted it in the chat.
01:24:43 Oh, fuck, what's her name?
01:24:44 I should remember.
01:24:45 It's Katie.
01:24:46 Katie, right.
01:24:47 Yeah, just some normal name for a slime girl.
01:24:51 I wanted that to be the thing, is that she's a freak.
01:24:54 Pretty aesthetic.
01:24:55 But she's a person.
01:24:56 You know, actually, Jesse, how do you feel about this?
01:24:58 I learned a tragic...
01:24:59 No, you're not talking about Final Fantasy VII.
01:25:01 No, you know what?
01:25:02 I'm trying to distract you.
01:25:03 Just go ahead, honestly.
01:25:04 There's no better week for me to have you guys just go.
01:25:08 I don't want to...
01:25:09 You don't want to hear from me.
01:25:10 Sure.
01:25:11 Better this way.
01:25:12 Agreed.
01:25:13 It's just that I was playing the original Final Fantasy VII a little bit, and I realized,
01:25:17 I was like, oh, look, they've got mouths.
01:25:19 This must be because of, you know, like, more polys, more fucking pixels on the screen.
01:25:25 Everything else is, like, sharp and nice, because I'm playing on, like, the PC rear-release.
01:25:28 Which, and by the way, I patched in the correct OG music.
01:25:31 It has terrible music.
01:25:32 You have to fix it, but I did that.
01:25:34 But now they've got...
01:25:35 I was like, wait, what?
01:25:36 They've got mouths?
01:25:37 Wait, was those not in the original?
01:25:38 And I looked it up, and they...
01:25:40 You talk about a hack remake in the true original.
01:25:43 The models did not have mouths.
01:25:45 In the horrible PC re-releases, they have mouths on the models.
01:25:50 And talk about disrespecting...
01:25:52 Well, I think we've been shitting on the wrong remake this whole time.
01:25:56 Yeah, that's right.
01:25:58 That's my point.
01:25:59 The mouths.
01:26:00 Just a note to Eleazar.
01:26:02 You guys may not have heard, but I was doodling on my guitar in the background.
01:26:06 Oh, I heard.
01:26:07 It was great.
01:26:08 I would like Eleazar, could you please max gain reverb so nobody can hear anything?
01:26:13 I wasn't even playing well, so it would be bad if people heard what I was doing.
01:26:17 But please do that anyway.
01:26:20 Side note, this is not about the game specifically.
01:26:23 Jess, do you know this guy, 4-8 Productions, who makes all these crazy...
01:26:27 He makes like the in-depth character material.
01:26:30 I think so, yeah.
01:26:32 Yeah, it's just that that guy...
01:26:34 Oh God, wait, I had a point.
01:26:36 But I completely forgot what my point was.
01:26:38 He's cool.
01:26:39 Yeah, he's not a bad boy.
01:26:41 I mean, that guy's a deep level boy.
01:26:43 He just released a mod that he and his community or whatever made for the original Final Fantasy VII that I maybe will play.
01:26:52 It seemed pretty cool.
01:26:53 Anyway, I totally forget the point of bringing that guy up, but anyway, shout out to that guy.
01:26:57 He's cool and I like what he does.
01:26:59 And if you like the remake, I will come to your house.
01:27:01 And it just won't be a pretty say, it's all there is to it.
01:27:05 Alright, I have one thing to talk about.
01:27:08 It might not last for too long, but that's whatever.
01:27:11 Neither do I, while having sex.
01:27:14 Oh yeah.
01:27:16 There's a guy I follow.
01:27:19 He makes a marble machine.
01:27:22 He's called Martin.
01:27:24 It's called the Marble Machine X and I was watching his latest video.
01:27:27 Is that the musical instrument?
01:27:30 He's got an extremely popular video of him playing the Marble Machine X, Marble Machine song with like a prototype.
01:27:40 And he's been spending the last three years or so building the next one, which is like more like stronger and powerful and can do more things.
01:27:50 It's very, very good YouTube series.
01:27:52 Probably my favorite thing on the site.
01:27:55 But the point is he has a latest video.
01:28:00 He talks about this idea of dopamine detoxing as a way to focus, which I have put into practice the last few days.
01:28:09 It's been very helpful for people like me who are dumb and stupid and do not work when I need and want to.
01:28:18 Tell me more.
01:28:19 The basic premise is that notifications like little plus ones, little comments, little anything is a rush.
01:28:29 It's very addictive as it's social media is designed to be that way.
01:28:36 And all sorts of things in life are addictive by nature.
01:28:39 You want to do them so that they can sell them to you again.
01:28:43 And that's, you know, it's bad for you generally to get so used to having a high level of dopamine in your system.
01:28:50 The idea he had was in order to focus, he needed to detox this dopamine out of his system so that he wouldn't go back.
01:28:59 So he would be more able to resist the urge and the temptation to like put on a podcast while he's working and distract himself and be slower while he's doing things.
01:29:09 Because some people, they put on podcasts.
01:29:12 I mean, I know I used to do this before I switched to music, but music is still kind of a bad thing where you can't do anything unless you have somebody's voice in the room being on a podcast saying things that you can't work.
01:29:25 It's impossible.
01:29:27 And it's not generally a good place to be in because you're going to run out of podcasts.
01:29:33 There's so many of them and not all of them are going to be the best thing.
01:29:37 But it's also just sort of a hassle that you could live without.
01:29:41 And I've been trying to work completely in silence with no YouTube, no Discord, no nothing.
01:29:49 Because I've done sort of half measures before.
01:29:51 I've like got rid of YouTube and Twitter and stuff and it sort of helps.
01:29:58 But I still feel this urge to be distracted by things.
01:30:02 And so I think the the idea is like on a long term plan basis is to at least while I'm trying to get this fucking Lord of Ghost comic finished is to
01:30:13 deprive myself of stuff for a long period as possible so that I can be used to being bored in a sense to you being used and able to live comfortably without needing to be looking at a media.
01:30:28 And it was pretty effective the last few days before the weekend started where I got like three whole pages done per day as opposed to the zero I have done in the last and since Radcon four ended I've done zero.
01:30:43 So in the last two days I've done three per day and that's pretty fucking good.
01:30:48 That's yeah, that's good.
01:30:50 Minimize distraction always seems like the right way to go.
01:30:53 And yeah, yeah, sounds like you're getting results.
01:30:57 Have you disabled notifications on your phone yet?
01:31:00 I did that like last year and it's very effective.
01:31:03 The only notifications I have active on my phone are text messages and phone calls, aka things I would actually care about.
01:31:11 I mean, I turned off notifications as soon as I installed any apps because I didn't like the beep happening and then be looking and it'd be like the sort of thing I would see on desktop and just do a click.
01:31:24 But with a phone you have to pick it up off the whatever surface is on and then sometimes you have to, you know, press the pin just to see that.
01:31:31 Oh, nothing is happening at all and I didn't need to pick up my phone.
01:31:35 So I've already had that completely turned off but I have now on my phone.
01:31:39 I talked about it before this app called app block, which I can set to limit my ability to use any like apps I desire for a certain amount of maximum time per day.
01:31:52 So I have a thing called, I don't know what it's called, it's just like a group.
01:31:57 It's got all of the possible things including like browsers so that I can't look things up and it just disables them after one and a half hours of use per day.
01:32:08 So I got one and a half hours and it's usually when I'm waking up and I just need something in my front of my face to like a shine a light at me so I can see it like.
01:32:17 But after that it's gone and I can't use my phone basically.
01:32:21 It's a very expensive paperweight.
01:32:24 I would do that except I have to be ready for when Gamergate 2 starts and I'm called to drop the bombs so I really can't detach from my social media presence.
01:32:33 It's not so much detaching from social media.
01:32:35 I definitely still post on Twitter and stuff.
01:32:38 You've seen those.
01:32:39 I definitely am going to be involved in Gamergate 2 guys.
01:32:41 Don't worry about that.
01:32:42 I'll make the time.
01:32:43 I've got a pager for that.
01:32:47 Okay.
01:32:48 That's right.
01:32:49 An exclusive dedicated device for Gamergate 2's beginning.
01:32:52 Yeah.
01:32:53 I just press the button to respond and it makes terrible things happen.
01:32:59 It's like it's like in the end of like Avengers where where the fucking Captain Marvel beeper goes off.
01:33:03 That's going to be.
01:33:04 Oh yeah.
01:33:05 The beeper only has one button and what that button does is send sexual harassment to girl gamers.
01:33:10 That's what it does.
01:33:11 It's the sole purpose of the device.
01:33:13 It's great.
01:33:16 It's just send harassing tweets to Zoe.
01:33:19 What is it?
01:33:20 What is it?
01:33:21 Go home gamer girl.
01:33:22 It just posts that clip from that episode.
01:33:26 Epic.
01:33:27 The point though is that you can you can maintain a social media presence while blocking everything.
01:33:33 It's just you need to have you need to have like the dedicated time to do it and then you know get away as soon as possible.
01:33:42 Discipline man.
01:33:43 Smart.
01:33:44 So many likes and retweets.
01:33:45 Reminds me of those.
01:33:46 Those are those are my big money maker even though I get no money from them.
01:33:52 People like those four commas.
01:33:54 That's that's what everybody's about.
01:33:55 They like those four panel easily shareable comments.
01:33:57 I like them.
01:33:58 I always like them when I see them.
01:33:59 Yeah.
01:34:00 They're a treat.
01:34:02 You should pay wall.
01:34:06 Huh?
01:34:07 You cut out.
01:34:08 I throw up that pay wall.
01:34:09 The big red pay wall.
01:34:10 Oh I've already got a pay.
01:34:11 I got that pay wall for that fucking punk only fans which more people have joined since I posted the last one.
01:34:17 It's really funny.
01:34:18 That's excellent.
01:34:19 You have a bunch of people in my discord saying Izumi needs an only fans.
01:34:22 Oh lord.
01:34:23 You started something.
01:34:24 Our daughters are going to be whores of engine.
01:34:26 Is there like actually content on it?
01:34:28 There are two images that basically two sides of a ducky macro that I drew for fun.
01:34:33 Okay.
01:34:34 How can I engage with every person individually online and decide which specific content I want to pay wall from this specific person?
01:34:40 That's what I want.
01:34:41 I want pure adaptability.
01:34:43 I want to know when I've met a real cash cow and exactly how he'll be willing to give me if I can just squeeze it out of him.
01:34:50 But make sure that other people who I know I can't get any money from, I know that they can have everything for free because it's all good in the hood.
01:34:57 That would be the ideal consumer setup for me.
01:35:01 Alas, I lack the will or the power or the cowardice.
01:35:06 Anyway, onlyfans.com slash punk911, that's the URL.
01:35:11 Excellent, excellent.
01:35:13 Incredible.
01:35:14 Punk911 through 910 would take it, I assume.
01:35:19 Is it 911 or 9-11?
01:35:22 911.
01:35:23 911.
01:35:24 Just making sure.
01:35:25 Because punk911 is a whole other thing.
01:35:30 Don't even worry about it.
01:35:32 Don't give that person their money.
01:35:35 I want to make my only fan that's punk711.
01:35:39 It's just punk hanging out of 7-11.
01:35:42 Just getting a drink.
01:35:44 Getting a burger.
01:35:45 What would she drink?
01:35:47 Probably not liquid because I would put her out.
01:35:49 Put her out and she'd die instantly.
01:35:51 Oil, yeah.
01:35:52 Oil.
01:35:53 Petrol, fucking explosive liquid.
01:35:56 Nitroglycer.
01:35:57 Nitroglycer.
01:35:58 Picks up a bottle of fucking olive oil.
01:36:00 That's an energy drink.
01:36:02 Yes, excellent.
01:36:05 Well, voicemails?
01:36:07 I got them.
01:36:08 I got the voicemails.
01:36:09 We could do them.
01:36:10 We could do them.
01:36:11 We could do them.
01:36:12 We could not.
01:36:13 All right, I got them.
01:36:14 I got it right here.
01:36:15 Endless War, pin kick starter, still going.
01:36:17 Link in the description.
01:36:18 Still going?
01:36:19 Are we cool?
01:36:20 Are we more?
01:36:21 It will be going.
01:36:22 It will be going until not the Friday you're listening to this, but the Friday after that
01:36:29 and it will end at like, I think like 8 p.m. that Friday and we'll stream like end of
01:36:36 the campaign on Rowdy Fricker's Cop Killers.
01:36:39 Those end of campaign streams seem to be where it's at.
01:36:42 I mean, it works pretty well for the frickin' the other Radcon.
01:36:46 It sure did.
01:36:47 It sure did.
01:36:48 I'm gonna just do it again.
01:36:50 Are there new pins to tantalize me bad?
01:36:52 Do we have more pins?
01:36:54 Yeah, I think since the last time you may have checked, yes.
01:36:58 There's a bunch.
01:36:59 I mean, there's a bunch that have been like funded but have not been chosen yet, so there's
01:37:04 like more coming.
01:37:05 The Coatron is there.
01:37:07 Yeah, Cop Killers, Rowdy Frickers, Smyrg's Negus Slime Ghost, The Challenge Coin, Slime
01:37:12 Corp.
01:37:13 Another one by Smyrgan Labunguspe.
01:37:16 I don't know how to say that.
01:37:18 Oh, God.
01:37:19 Is that one of the girl on the treadmill?
01:37:21 Is that a reference to that thing?
01:37:23 You guys know what I'm talking about.
01:37:25 That laser set where the little girl gets all lasered and it's very graphic.
01:37:31 Is that what that is?
01:37:32 I don't know what the fun girl is talking about.
01:37:34 That's Goo Girls Limited in the style of the Portal 2 thing.
01:37:38 Portal 2?
01:37:39 Remember that?
01:37:40 No, great.
01:37:41 The little paper cut out people.
01:37:43 Is that like a remake of Portal 1 or something?
01:37:46 Yeah, that's right.
01:37:47 God, I hope so.
01:37:48 They have those little animations on the wall with the paper cut out people at a 45 degree
01:37:53 angle, like an isometric view.
01:37:54 Okay.
01:37:55 I don't know.
01:37:56 The point is it's the Goo Girls Limited logo.
01:37:59 Yeah.
01:38:00 I see Pizza Chan.
01:38:01 Pizza Chan is cemented here.
01:38:02 Pizza Chan.
01:38:03 Excellent.
01:38:04 The Podron.
01:38:05 An iron-on New Los Angeles City flag patch that one might wear on their arm, for instance.
01:38:10 Indeed.
01:38:11 Good shit.
01:38:12 I'm going to iron it onto my forehead.
01:38:13 There's a lot of really good shit here.
01:38:15 I'm going to have huge bags of all this hanging out.
01:38:18 There's going to be overflow.
01:38:20 I'm going to have hundreds of like, no matter what I do.
01:38:23 We're going to have hundreds and hundreds of like, undelivered-
01:38:25 When the kids come around for Halloween next year, you'll fill their bowls with-
01:38:28 Stick your hand in this bag and they'll stick it in and they'll get stabbed by the pins.
01:38:33 As they deserve.
01:38:35 Sounds about.
01:38:36 Okay, we can make this work.
01:38:37 But yes, so that's what's up.
01:38:39 A lot of fucking cool shit up for grabs right now.
01:38:41 Link in the description.
01:38:43 Had to mention it.
01:38:44 Can't let a week go by.
01:38:46 Go pledge for pins, everybody, if you want them.
01:38:48 And I certainly do.
01:38:49 You know, I forgot to pledge, but I should do it today because I know I want them and
01:38:52 I got to do that.
01:38:53 I mean, as more become available, I'm hoping that people will just up their pledges.
01:38:57 They're like, oh, I want that one too.
01:38:59 I want that one too.
01:39:00 And I mean, they get cheaper as you get more.
01:39:02 At like 50, they're just like five bucks a piece, which is like-
01:39:04 Oh, and you know what?
01:39:05 Now, actually, I'm glad you mentioned this.
01:39:06 Now is an excellent time to mention also that so on the Radcon 4 kickstart, you may have heard of.
01:39:12 Now, by the time you're hearing this, it'll be Friday the 1st.
01:39:15 So technically a day passed, the guarantee.
01:39:18 But I think we might have a little wiggle room potentially.
01:39:22 If anybody out there backed the Radcon 4 kickstarter and got physical rewards and has not yet submitted their fucking shit to the kickstarter,
01:39:32 do it now and you might get in under the wire.
01:39:35 We'll see.
01:39:36 If not, you might be fucked, but do your best.
01:39:39 Do your best.
01:39:40 I think most people are in.
01:39:41 I think there might be a couple of straggles as well.
01:39:43 So you will literally not get the stuff you earned if you just don't respond to that.
01:39:47 Yeah, we have to know where to send it.
01:39:49 Or else we just can't do it.
01:39:51 We won't even make it, because we're only going to make as many as we know where to send.
01:39:54 Right, because we're going to have to place an order soon.
01:39:56 That's right.
01:39:57 Who knows how long it's going to fucking take to get here.
01:40:00 So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
01:40:01 The virus.
01:40:02 Your fate is in your hands.
01:40:03 Act quickly and decisively.
01:40:05 All right.
01:40:06 With that being said, I'm glad somebody mentioned that.
01:40:09 I was reminded of that.
01:40:10 I wanted to say that.
01:40:11 All right.
01:40:12 Well, anyway, let's do voicemails.
01:40:13 We got voicemails here.
01:40:14 There's only three.
01:40:15 A mere pittance.
01:40:16 Wow.
01:40:17 But they are selectively chosen.
01:40:19 Lot of shit this week, boys.
01:40:21 Lot of shit to wade through.
01:40:23 But I have chosen the ones that made me feel anything at all.
01:40:27 Very good.
01:40:28 So here they are.
01:40:29 That's good.
01:40:30 I like that.
01:40:31 Indeed.
01:40:32 And that still may not be a high bar, but it's something as opposed to nothing.
01:40:36 And of course, the link to leave them is the speak pipe link down in the description.
01:40:40 Click that and go ahead and leave some message.
01:40:43 All right.
01:40:44 Make it good, though.
01:40:45 Don't fuck around.
01:40:46 All right.
01:40:47 Here's the first one.
01:40:48 This is from Joe Pesci.
01:40:51 Joe Pesci has left us a voicemail.
01:40:52 Let's hear it.
01:40:53 Take it away, Joe.
01:40:54 Hey, bro.
01:40:55 Great.
01:40:56 This is Joe Pesci.
01:40:57 Hey, listen.
01:40:58 My question is, why don't, why come the bread galling out like Serena?
01:41:04 I fucking, that's my question.
01:41:06 If you don't have an attitude, I'll come down and I'll fucking bust your balls.
01:41:10 I have a good night.
01:41:12 Thanks, Joe.
01:41:14 Well, straight to the point.
01:41:16 Straight to the point, Joe.
01:41:18 Well, short answer.
01:41:20 We are in the works with a lot of political negotiation going on.
01:41:24 A lot of red tape we got to cut through.
01:41:27 I can guarantee you, though, it is coming.
01:41:29 It is coming.
01:41:30 It's in the works.
01:41:31 Won't be too long.
01:41:32 But I think before that, you'll probably hear a certain song about Brad.
01:41:35 So it won't come before the song.
01:41:37 So we'll see when that happens.
01:41:39 All right.
01:41:40 That's it, Joe.
01:41:41 Thank you for your no more contribution.
01:41:42 No more emails from that.
01:41:43 No more emails from that guy.
01:41:45 Okay.
01:41:46 Agreed.
01:41:47 Agreed.
01:41:48 He scares me.
01:41:49 I fear he's going to bust her balls.
01:41:52 All right.
01:41:53 Next up, we've got, oh, this is a simply titled Digi Bro interview.
01:41:59 Let's hear how it goes.
01:42:03 So Digi Bro, thank you so much for coming to this interview.
01:42:06 I'd like to ask a few questions about what's your inspiration?
01:42:09 You know, what gives you the drive to live?
01:42:11 If I want to live, I have to go find things to kill.
01:42:15 I have time to think about that now because I'm killing so much more efficiently.
01:42:19 I see.
01:42:20 I see.
01:42:21 So now that you have time to think about these things, is there a sort of revelation
01:42:25 that you've had with your identity?
01:42:26 I mean, like, what type of person would you call yourself?
01:42:29 I'm a caveman.
01:42:30 I have to hunt to eat.
01:42:33 Interesting.
01:42:34 Interesting.
01:42:35 So would you say there was a point in time where you first had this revelation?
01:42:39 Like describe the moment that you realized this.
01:42:42 What was going on then?
01:42:44 So I grab a rock.
01:42:45 I beat this board of death.
01:42:46 I'm like sick.
01:42:47 Ah, yes.
01:42:48 Now that's what I'm sure we can all relate to.
01:42:50 But I'm really wondering your anime YouTube channel was going pretty well.
01:42:54 This seems like a big shift in priorities.
01:42:57 Can you detail some of the thought process that has gone into that change?
01:43:01 Okay.
01:43:02 This worked out so well.
01:43:03 What other fucking rocks?
01:43:05 What other kind of fucking sticks have I thought of?
01:43:07 So let's fucking go kill some boars.
01:43:10 It's better than ever.
01:43:11 Well, you heard it here, folks.
01:43:13 That's all the time I'll have.
01:43:15 Thank you so much for stopping by, did you, bro?
01:43:17 It was a pleasure speaking with you.
01:43:19 That's literally what I hear from both sides.
01:43:23 Fine.
01:43:24 Next.
01:43:25 All right.
01:43:27 That was less funny listening back to it than I remember it being.
01:43:31 All right.
01:43:32 Well, thank you for your contribution.
01:43:33 Excellent interview.
01:43:34 I could hear the editing clips, so I know you put effort into that.
01:43:37 Well done.
01:43:38 All right.
01:43:39 Next one is our final voicemails from Ajax.
01:43:42 Ajax, go.
01:43:44 Oh, yeah.
01:43:45 It's about to get real, because it's me, your worst enemy, formerly known as H4Hotboy,
01:43:50 but is now Ajax the Invincible Overlord, the Chad with the most bad, the Deer with the
01:43:54 most milk cure, and after our battle with Terminal 7 clown aides, I've transformed,
01:43:58 changed form into my prime dad, Formation Alpha, and ever regularly begun wearing a belt
01:44:03 to everyday events.
01:44:04 But I'm not here just to be a survivor or a father figure that you've always wanted.
01:44:08 I'm here to declare that I'm the most linear and lexical of anyone in the PCP.
01:44:12 Now, that you impressionist lateral fucks don't know the first thing about a woman and
01:44:15 certainly don't deserve the affection of your crush or your anime waifu.
01:44:19 So that's why I'm not here just to red pill you, because we're beyond that.
01:44:23 I'm here to gold pill you, so you'll be as based in that because of me, because when
01:44:26 I was a grown ass man in the 6th grade, I read a graphic novel called Panhemonium, and
01:44:30 my head was spinning with all the messages of responsibility and loving your fellow
01:44:34 man, that I forgot everything but the main characters, cute, goth twink ass, and the
01:44:38 wacky line on the last page, brush your hair, comb your shirt and iron your teeth, wrang
01:44:42 through my head, and after a vision quest where I was sitting on a sinking ship, I had
01:44:46 to find it again, and only by googling demon twink graphic novel, young adult did I find
01:44:50 it after 45 minutes with the safe search turned on.
01:44:53 It can be done, you can live the dream and be nearly as cool as me, you just have to believe.
01:44:58 And for you, Nate, my worst enemy of all, watch out at the gym where I'll be going
01:45:03 monkey mode so hard your girl will file a divorce to marry someone who's cooler than you,
01:45:08 but not as cool as me, because marriage is wack, but not as wack as premarital sex.
01:45:15 Great, is that it?
01:45:16 Thank you, that's it, that's it.
01:45:18 No more voicemails ever.
01:45:20 Thank you, Ajax, for your contribution to this show.
01:45:25 We'll never forget you.
01:45:27 Alright, that's it, leave your stellar voicemails in this vein exactly at the speak pipe link
01:45:34 down below.
01:45:35 I'm sorry, I don't put you in just to roast you, it just sounded funnier when I was listening
01:45:39 to it before.
01:45:40 And your sleep deprived super before Final Fantasy 7.
01:45:43 I was incredibly sleep deprived before this episode, as I explained at the beginning, but
01:45:48 when you get angry and yell about stuff, it does wonders for the energy levels.
01:45:52 I will go crash after this.
01:45:54 Okay, but anyway, anyway, right, speak pipe, more voicemails, thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
01:45:58 we will continue to weed the weed from the chaff as we've done so diligently here today.
01:46:02 Hey, go to patreon.com slash theprocrastinators and give us money, because it's the end of
01:46:07 the show.
01:46:08 And that was a voicemail, and you can give us money to get bonus episodes, which when
01:46:12 you hear this, there will be a new episode.
01:46:15 Not today, but tomorrow, I think, is when we'll be releasing the next bonus episode.
01:46:20 That's 37 of them for $5.
01:46:23 Incredible, incredible.
01:46:25 It is.
01:46:26 Truly.
01:46:27 It is not, it's not.
01:46:28 The value never stops from getting more.
01:46:30 The value only goes up.
01:46:31 It's true.
01:46:32 And what else we got?
01:46:34 At TP Crastinators on Twitter, four more updates.
01:46:36 We got more rad con stuff, we're working on a bunch of stuff, we'll get it to you in
01:46:40 time.
01:46:41 There's not a lot of things, some big stuff that's going to take a while, so we'll keep
01:46:45 you posted on how that goes.
01:46:46 But yeah, make sure if you're a backer, you go to the fucking Kickstarter and you fucking
01:46:51 respond to the backer survey so we know where to send your shit and he tells what size shirt
01:46:54 you are or whatever, all that good stuff.
01:46:57 Beyond that, there's nothing.
01:46:59 That's the end of the episode.
01:47:00 We've done everything.
01:47:01 Nice.
01:47:02 Go to these guys' links, comics and kickstarters and all kinds of good stuff, YouTube's, there's
01:47:07 links in the description.
01:47:08 Go check them out.
01:47:09 And maybe check out, this episode was sponsored by the Final Nights at 7 Remake.
01:47:12 I've been paid to shill for it.
01:47:15 This is all a sigh up where I make you so mad at me being mad that you buy the game to
01:47:20 prove me wrong.
01:47:22 And I'm glad to be doing my duty.
01:47:24 Buy it from the Amazon affiliate link in the description below.
01:47:27 Indeed.
01:47:28 Indeed.
01:47:29 Should they buy it?
01:47:30 Do you want people to buy it?
01:47:31 No, right?
01:47:32 We're firmly anti.
01:47:33 Are we all firmly?
01:47:34 Well.
01:47:35 Last time there was a lot of precarication and uncertainty.
01:47:37 It's too late to be anti, it's happening, so I don't give a fuck.
01:47:43 I would not, I mean, I don't want to encourage this kind of thing, so no, I don't want people
01:47:48 to buy it.
01:47:49 But I mean, the game already is like the best selling game on PS4 basically, because they
01:47:54 wanted a remake of a game everybody already loved and nobody signed up for this shit
01:47:59 and they can pretend that they like it now.
01:48:01 No, no, no, no, no, I'm going to cut you off here, you're going to just repeat yourself
01:48:04 30 more times.
01:48:06 Okay, I will just say, not everybody's pretending, some people legitimately like it, just disagree.
01:48:10 Okay, there you go, there you go, there you go, there you go, there you go, there you
01:48:13 go, there you go.
01:48:14 And end of episode, we'll see you next week, everybody, more on that bonus side, so don't
01:48:19 forget to tune in to that.
01:48:21 Alright, goodbye.
01:48:22 I'm going to go watch the Star Citizen.
01:48:24 Good fucking bye.
01:48:25 Bye.
01:48:26 Goodbye.
01:48:27 Bye.
01:48:28 Bye.
