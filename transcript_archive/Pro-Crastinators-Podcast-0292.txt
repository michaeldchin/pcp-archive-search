00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Alright, what would be a funny way to start an episode?
00:00:16 I can't keep falling back on the classic, hello, I'm The Pro Crastinators,
00:00:20 but there's gotta be something better to do.
00:00:23 It can't just go back to the Doug Walker well all the time.
00:00:27 That's always my first impulse.
00:00:30 Right.
00:00:32 But that's all I can think of.
00:00:34 I stumbled on the Crow Masticators again. Remember them?
00:00:38 No.
00:00:40 Are they still posting?
00:00:43 I don't think so, but all the videos were years old and I was like, damn,
00:00:48 I better remember these guys.
00:00:51 I remember.
00:00:53 I had forgotten.
00:00:56 Semi-recently, I feel like we discussed them again.
00:00:59 They brought them up and were like, oh yeah, remember those?
00:01:02 Remember those guys? It might have been in my discord.
00:01:04 No, I think it was a spiral made like, he was going through all the old episodes
00:01:10 keeping the N-word tally, and he kept notes, and he showed some notes,
00:01:14 and they included like, remember the Crow Masticators?
00:01:17 I was like, oh yeah, the Crow Masticators.
00:01:21 Our rivals, I guess.
00:01:25 What a journey it's been.
00:01:32 It's me, Ben Saint, Gibbon Takes Here, and our guests this week are
00:01:37 Oblivion Fall again.
00:01:39 You.
00:01:41 And Kaijukun, we're also returning.
00:01:44 Right, you were on one another time.
00:01:46 Yes, Kaijukun, art guy.
00:01:50 What's up?
00:01:56 Well, yesterday, we got the tree, got a good old Christmas tree,
00:02:02 and today, I've been decorating all day.
00:02:05 So I've been up and down, step ladders, putting lights on bushes and trees and things outside,
00:02:14 and running around, and people have been swearing because of untangling things,
00:02:20 and you know, it's the worst time of year, but it looks really pretty afterwards,
00:02:25 so I'm pooped right now.
00:02:27 I'm pooped, but it's looking good, I guess.
00:02:31 I helped my dad decorate the tree at Thanksgiving.
00:02:35 He had already done the outside lights.
00:02:37 Yeah, the Thanksgiving tree?
00:02:39 Well, no, but you put it up, it was up early.
00:02:43 You put it up early, and then we decorated it.
00:02:47 It was great.
00:02:48 I loved it.
00:02:50 Okay, right.
00:02:52 Kaijukun and Oblivion Fall, you guys are not from America, so you don't celebrate Christmas,
00:02:57 so sorry to exclude you.
00:02:59 Oh, yeah.
00:03:01 I've never heard of Christmas, ever.
00:03:03 What's that?
00:03:05 Never done one of those.
00:03:07 No, I don't know.
00:03:09 I'm sorry.
00:03:11 That was a joke.
00:03:13 You guys do like Kwanzaa or something.
00:03:15 No, it's bullshit.
00:03:17 We have Christmas in New Zealand, but our Christmas is better because it's hot,
00:03:19 and it's summer.
00:03:21 Oh, yeah.
00:03:23 How bizarre.
00:03:25 Santa is like, he's got a ski...
00:03:27 No, not skis.
00:03:29 What was it called?
00:03:31 Surfing.
00:03:33 He's a surfer, he's an idiot.
00:03:35 He's getting sunburned.
00:03:37 I feel like the whole point, I mean obviously Christmas comes from like,
00:03:41 Norse traditions and stuff of like,
00:03:44 winter feast because it's cold, everybody warm up and try to make yourselves happy
00:03:49 because it sucks outside, but doing that in the summer,
00:03:53 I'd just be like, I'm trying to relax on the beach, I don't want to put up decorations,
00:03:57 I don't want to do all that.
00:03:59 It's summertime, it's the whole time.
00:04:01 Literally, it's defeating the point.
00:04:03 Really, it's like what's even the point of Christmas.
00:04:05 We still have like the fucking Christmas socking,
00:04:07 which is like a big fluffy sock that's meant to keep you warm, I guess,
00:04:11 but it's already hot.
00:04:13 You should do like a Christmas crocs or a Christmas flipper.
00:04:16 Christmas snorkel.
00:04:18 Yeah, that would make no sense.
00:04:20 A Christmas sandal.
00:04:22 A Christmas croc.
00:04:26 Yes.
00:04:27 Totally.
00:04:29 I guess I have to buy some gifts or something.
00:04:33 I fucking hate this shit.
00:04:35 I hate gifts so much.
00:04:37 I hate giving them and honestly, I hate getting them too.
00:04:39 What a disaster.
00:04:41 My family is doing a secret Santa this year,
00:04:44 and that's like the only thing we're doing because a lot of us are poor right now.
00:04:48 Yeah.
00:04:52 I'm supposed to buy a gift for someone,
00:04:55 and it's supposed to be like around a hundred New Zealand dollars,
00:04:59 but the two things that they asked for is something that's free
00:05:03 and something that's free hundred dollars,
00:05:05 and I can't get eye for a pose because the free one,
00:05:09 they could just grab, I don't think they realize it's for free,
00:05:12 so I have to find something else for them.
00:05:14 So get it for free.
00:05:15 I've been putting it off.
00:05:16 So do that one.
00:05:18 What's even the question here?
00:05:20 But if you have money left over, you're supposed to get something else from the list,
00:05:25 it's like, I don't fucking know what to do.
00:05:28 It's also shit you can buy on Steam,
00:05:30 so there's no rush, I can just buy it on the day
00:05:32 or find something else for them, but it's dumb.
00:05:36 Wait until it goes off sale so you can spend money on it.
00:05:40 Oh yeah, good idea.
00:05:42 I have already done my gifts for a family.
00:05:45 They're simple things.
00:05:47 Previous years, I know I've talked about this on the PCP,
00:05:50 but previous years I've said,
00:05:52 ah, you know what, I'm just going to ask people exactly what they want,
00:05:56 and then I'm going to buy that, so there's no chance that they'd be disappointed.
00:06:00 But I found that there's less interest when they open the package,
00:06:03 and that's kind of lame.
00:06:05 They're just like, oh yeah, you got me a thing.
00:06:06 It is lame.
00:06:07 I said, so now I'm not doing that.
00:06:10 I am buying things based on what I think they will like,
00:06:13 and I don't know who of them will be listening to this,
00:06:16 so I can't say, but they're pretty good.
00:06:19 They're like a beyond like a cheap piece of shit,
00:06:25 but not so expensive that it's embarrassing or like too much.
00:06:30 It's just sort of a mid thing.
00:06:32 That's good.
00:06:33 It's good.
00:06:34 It's efficient.
00:06:35 It's economical.
00:06:37 Wow.
00:06:38 That's right.
00:06:39 That's correct.
00:06:40 What I like to do, I actually like given presents,
00:06:45 and I usually look for any excuse to make presents,
00:06:50 but the fun thing about it is that I like to do my own packages,
00:06:55 so I just pick some random paper stuff or something,
00:06:58 and it just draw.
00:07:00 It do random drawings according to giving clues of what the present is,
00:07:07 and people would like that.
00:07:09 That's awfully thought.
00:07:11 Yeah, I mean, that's pretty thoughtful.
00:07:13 That's pretty nice.
00:07:15 That's more effort than I'm willing to put into it.
00:07:19 This is fun.
00:07:20 This is fun.
00:07:21 But I guess that says more about me when it does about you,
00:07:24 so that's okay.
00:07:28 Pretty good.
00:07:29 I guess I'd like to receive a Kaiju gift.
00:07:32 I guess.
00:07:34 You would like to.
00:07:36 Oh, really?
00:07:37 Drawings are fun.
00:07:39 I hadn't thought, because family, they don't like internet things necessarily,
00:07:47 but for internet friends, drawing characters and stuff for them,
00:07:51 that's good.
00:07:52 I could try that.
00:07:53 I could do a bit of that.
00:07:55 Yeah, it was a shitty doodle.
00:07:58 A few days ago, one of my friends,
00:08:01 well, it was the birthday of one of my friends,
00:08:05 and I gave him the volumes 99 and 100 of one piece,
00:08:11 because he likes one piece,
00:08:13 and I drew the entire straw hat crew on the paper,
00:08:17 and it was really cool.
00:08:21 Ladi, that's very nice.
00:08:23 Very impressive.
00:08:25 It's really fun.
00:08:27 I hate drawing, so I don't know what you mean.
00:08:32 I didn't take the picture.
00:08:35 Damn.
00:08:36 What a chore.
00:08:37 What a chore.
00:08:38 Oh, yeah, I took it.
00:08:39 No, it's not fungible.
00:08:41 It's forever a real thing.
00:08:43 No, no, I took a picture.
00:08:45 Hold on.
00:08:46 No, you fucked it.
00:08:47 Now it can be right-click saved.
00:08:49 Now it can be right-click saved.
00:08:51 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:08:52 It's off the blockchain.
00:08:54 Before, it existed only in the realm of ideas on the blockchain.
00:08:59 Well, now it's real.
00:09:04 I don't know how to share pictures.
00:09:06 Hold on.
00:09:09 What is this?
00:09:10 Well, you figure that out.
00:09:12 I finished all my commissions.
00:09:15 Finally, I haven't had my commission list clear
00:09:18 in like probably about five years.
00:09:21 Oh, the vectors?
00:09:24 Yeah, but my little pony things,
00:09:26 where I do hundreds of images of people's characters each.
00:09:30 I was working on one during the last episode.
00:09:32 I finished it.
00:09:33 And then I started on that punk Tommy Oliver design,
00:09:36 which I also finish for next day.
00:09:38 I think in total, I did one commission a day
00:09:42 for the first eight days of December,
00:09:44 since I lost a conservation gig.
00:09:46 And that was like 1,500 drawings total.
00:09:50 But yeah, there's an image of like all the different characters
00:09:53 I've done currently.
00:09:56 I know a bunch of these people.
00:09:58 I didn't see the full list before.
00:09:59 I know Sweetie Bloom.
00:10:03 Is that Eliora?
00:10:04 No, I don't think that is Eliora.
00:10:07 Who else do I know on this list?
00:10:09 There's probably more.
00:10:14 No, never mind.
00:10:15 That's not for a question.
00:10:16 It's on there.
00:10:17 Sifisto commission, at some point.
00:10:21 Good.
00:10:23 Not good.
00:10:24 I'm glad.
00:10:25 Oh, Golden Fox.
00:10:28 I see Golden Fox.
00:10:29 I know who that is.
00:10:30 I know who that is.
00:10:32 Oh, is he the one with the sunglasses there?
00:10:34 Yeah, I see it.
00:10:35 Yeah.
00:10:36 Well, what a trip down memory lane.
00:10:40 Base, congratulations on getting all that done.
00:10:44 That's impressive work.
00:10:48 This is an impressive Uber, I'm looking at.
00:10:50 A nice body of work you've built up here.
00:10:52 A good resume.
00:10:55 Yeah.
00:10:57 I feel intimidated.
00:10:58 I don't want to share my drawing anymore.
00:11:02 You're joking.
00:11:03 It's never going to be as cool as many, many ponies.
00:11:05 Yeah.
00:11:06 It's never going to be as cool as a thousand ponies.
00:11:09 It's so intimidating.
00:11:12 Oh, geez.
00:11:16 Yeah, that one's good.
00:11:18 That's a winner.
00:11:19 I'll give you that one.
00:11:20 That's a winner right there.
00:11:21 There you go.
00:11:23 Oh, perfect.
00:11:25 What's her name?
00:11:28 Cosmic Flair.
00:11:30 Cosmic Flair.
00:11:32 Yeah, this one.
00:11:33 Cosmic Flairs.
00:11:34 The hair was annoying.
00:11:36 So I started working on it in the first half of a year
00:11:40 and then just put it off for six months, finishing the hair.
00:11:44 Wow.
00:11:45 Even though most designs I can do in a single day.
00:11:48 Well, yeah, speaking of getting shown up by many ponies,
00:11:52 work, art, like doing stuff, been very hardworking on the secret project.
00:12:01 And it's stressing me out a little because I really want that done.
00:12:06 And I've got a lot of ghost stories that have all been handed in.
00:12:11 And now I have to make the PDF.
00:12:14 But at the moment, it's really stupid and I feel stupid
00:12:20 because basically all I need to do is like,
00:12:23 intro page, like here are the guest artist credits
00:12:27 and here are all the Kickstarter backers.
00:12:30 And thank you for reading or whatever.
00:12:32 Make the PDF.
00:12:34 I just can't choose the right font.
00:12:36 I can't put the layout and copy paste all of the names.
00:12:41 And it's just like, oh, I don't want to do that.
00:12:44 I don't want to be doing any of this.
00:12:47 I'm the bottleneck now.
00:12:48 It's my fault that it's not being made.
00:12:51 It feels bad.
00:12:52 Yeah.
00:12:53 Yeah, that does feel bad.
00:12:55 I know what you mean, though.
00:12:57 Making decisions is hard.
00:12:59 Yeah.
00:13:01 I got to a point.
00:13:03 I feel bad.
00:13:04 I'm in a bad mood because the last two days,
00:13:08 consecutively, I have been working all day, every day,
00:13:13 on my not secret project.
00:13:16 And I am at a part where I needed to write some dialogue.
00:13:20 I needed to stop coding and stop drawing and write some dialogue.
00:13:23 And it was so hard.
00:13:25 And twice now, I've written it and then I've been like, cool.
00:13:29 And then I've kept working for the rest of the day.
00:13:31 And then at the end of the day, I'm like, you know what?
00:13:33 It's bad, actually.
00:13:34 I need to rewrite it tomorrow.
00:13:36 And I just feel like I'm not making any progress.
00:13:40 It feels like I'm spinning my wheels and I'm upset about it.
00:13:44 What is it with text?
00:13:46 I'm going to take it out on all of you.
00:13:49 I don't know.
00:13:50 It's just too long.
00:13:52 I wrote and wrote and wrote.
00:13:54 And then at the end, I'm like, wow, this is like so many lines.
00:13:57 It shouldn't be this many lines.
00:13:59 It just goes on and on and on.
00:14:01 I have to whittle this down somehow.
00:14:06 But I don't know how.
00:14:08 So I don't know.
00:14:10 As soon as we're done recording, that's what I'll be doing today.
00:14:13 And I told myself I wanted to get the beta version done by exactly one week from today
00:14:22 when we're recording by next Sunday.
00:14:24 Will I do it?
00:14:25 I don't know.
00:14:26 If I don't, it's not a huge deal.
00:14:27 I just, for my own, because that's exactly one year since when I started,
00:14:31 I was like, it would be nice if I could have it done by then.
00:14:33 So I'm trying really hard.
00:14:35 I don't know if it'll happen.
00:14:37 Yeah.
00:14:39 It's many little deadlines that are mostly self-made.
00:14:46 But I would like to spend the Kickstarter money doing the printing
00:14:51 and as much as I can in shipping stuff.
00:14:54 Before the end of the year.
00:14:55 Before the end of the year, before I have to do my taxes
00:14:59 so I can write all of that expenses off.
00:15:02 Yeah.
00:15:03 Because that's going to be done for January.
00:15:05 And it's like, ah, geez.
00:15:06 Every day that I try to open the document, I'm like looking at it.
00:15:10 I see all the Kickstarter back as names.
00:15:12 I'm like, how should I arrange this?
00:15:14 Oh, fuck it.
00:15:15 And then I leave.
00:15:17 That's been like three days in a row.
00:15:20 And I come back to it and I'm like, ah, but oh shit.
00:15:23 Oh, we got to go get a Christmas tree.
00:15:26 You know, I'll help with that.
00:15:28 Oh, we got to put up lights.
00:15:30 Yeah, anything to prevent me from doing this thing.
00:15:35 Yeah.
00:15:36 I feel that way with writing dialogue a lot.
00:15:39 But I can't do it anymore because I have only a week
00:15:43 and it's not enough time.
00:15:45 And now I'm like, I just have to make myself do it.
00:15:47 But then I do it and it's bad.
00:15:49 And I'm like, well, okay, I got to redo it now.
00:15:52 So, you know, it's terrible.
00:15:54 I don't know.
00:15:56 Somebody, I don't know.
00:15:59 My life sucks.
00:16:00 Everything's a disaster.
00:16:02 What more can I say?
00:16:04 I got really mad.
00:16:05 I've been getting really mad at everyone.
00:16:08 And I've been mean on Twitter, even meaner than usual.
00:16:11 I got my account pseudo locked yesterday.
00:16:17 By pseudo locked, I mean that like everything's normal.
00:16:22 It's just people that don't follow me can't see my tweets for 12 hours.
00:16:27 And I think like four hours is left at this point.
00:16:30 So like two non-followers, I look like a locked account or whatever.
00:16:34 And this is a punishment.
00:16:36 And it was, I just told someone to fuck off.
00:16:39 I just told someone to fuck off.
00:16:40 And I guess I had told one too many people to fuck off that day.
00:16:44 And they were like, die.
00:16:46 And they pseudo locked my account.
00:16:48 I told someone to fuck off because they said it was an L.
00:16:52 That I told, what's the guy's name?
00:16:54 Was it not Matt?
00:16:56 The guy who, someone was calling for a boycott of Toei.
00:17:01 A like semi-big YouTuber.
00:17:03 And then like later that same day, he was like,
00:17:05 guys, I can't emotionally deal with this anymore.
00:17:08 I'm revoking my call for a boycott of Toei.
00:17:13 And like that's fucking weak shit.
00:17:15 Hey, that's exactly what I was going to talk about
00:17:18 because I'm the editor of that channel.
00:17:20 Really?
00:17:21 Yeah.
00:17:22 Yes.
00:17:23 Really?
00:17:24 Okay.
00:17:25 Well, let me just, I just, I heard that he called for a boycott
00:17:26 and then he like got upset or something and was like,
00:17:29 never mind, no boycott.
00:17:31 And I just think that's the,
00:17:32 and I just think that's the weakest shit in the world.
00:17:34 So I called him weak and then somebody responded to me to tell me
00:17:39 that was an L for not having enough empathy.
00:17:41 And I told that guy to fuck off.
00:17:43 And it got my account semi-locked for 12 hours.
00:17:46 And I was right.
00:17:47 He didn't ask for a boycott actually.
00:17:49 That was like the community, I guess.
00:17:52 Uh-huh.
00:17:54 So that's what he said.
00:17:56 He said, he said like I'm,
00:17:58 let me find the tweet so I know exactly what I'm talking about.
00:18:01 No, I remember,
00:18:02 I watched one of his, one of the earlier videos,
00:18:05 one of the two videos he made and he's like,
00:18:08 if this isn't rectified,
00:18:10 I will not be, uh, watching your new films or something.
00:18:15 Yeah.
00:18:16 Is that not technically a boycott?
00:18:17 Uh, he said that he didn't want to,
00:18:20 he didn't want to encourage toy animation anymore.
00:18:23 Uh, but people took like that as some kind of movement
00:18:29 and they created a hashtag or something.
00:18:32 And because of that,
00:18:34 uh, a lot of anxiety fell upon us.
00:18:39 Uh, so in the end what happened is that,
00:18:43 because we're, first of all,
00:18:46 uh, we're not used to that.
00:18:48 Uh, second of all,
00:18:51 um, we both have anxiety.
00:18:54 So,
00:18:56 I don't, I don't, I don't get it.
00:18:58 I know, it's really ex, I,
00:19:01 I wasn't expecting you guys talking about it,
00:19:05 uh, uh, before me.
00:19:07 So, um, I'm a bit unprepared right now.
00:19:12 Okay, sorry about that.
00:19:14 But yeah, um,
00:19:15 I just don't get it.
00:19:17 Well, I guess,
00:19:19 Not everyone wants to be the villain then.
00:19:21 Sometimes people don't.
00:19:23 How is it, how is it a villain?
00:19:24 How is it a villain?
00:19:25 I don't know anything.
00:19:26 First of all, I don't even know what Toei did,
00:19:28 but if they did something bad,
00:19:29 if they did something bad that you don't support.
00:19:32 They deleted 150 of his videos in like the span of an hour.
00:19:37 Yeah.
00:19:38 And, um,
00:19:39 Right.
00:19:40 And like the,
00:19:41 Okay.
00:19:42 The, the accumulated current,
00:19:44 you know, the revenue of those videos,
00:19:46 getting views over time is like how he pays.
00:19:49 Basically.
00:19:50 His editors.
00:19:51 Yeah, basically what,
00:19:52 what they did is just, um,
00:19:54 absolute abuse of the copyright system.
00:19:57 Like, um,
00:19:58 Okay.
00:19:59 How this works is like, um,
00:20:01 the company should watch the video.
00:20:03 Check, uh,
00:20:04 check with YouTube if it's actually a violation of the,
00:20:08 how is this, uh,
00:20:10 thing called the, um,
00:20:12 Oh, I forgot.
00:20:13 Content ID.
00:20:14 Yes.
00:20:15 Um,
00:20:16 and if,
00:20:17 if like,
00:20:18 if the channel is actually doing something wrong,
00:20:21 they're in the right to, you know,
00:20:23 block the video,
00:20:24 but they didn't do that.
00:20:26 They just, uh,
00:20:27 picked a number of videos that had Dragonball in the title,
00:20:31 and they just blocked them all.
00:20:33 Just instantly in like an hour.
00:20:36 And with that,
00:20:38 they destroy the entire revenue of the channel.
00:20:42 Yes.
00:20:43 And,
00:20:44 and because, uh,
00:20:45 we're all crew has to dispute all of them.
00:20:48 Yeah.
00:20:49 And,
00:20:50 but he can't do more than like two at once or something,
00:20:53 something about like,
00:20:54 if he does too many at once,
00:20:57 his channel might get destroyed or terminated.
00:20:59 Yep.
00:21:00 If they come back and say,
00:21:01 actually no,
00:21:02 which they always do.
00:21:03 Because it's like,
00:21:04 because it's like, if you look,
00:21:07 because if you dispute,
00:21:08 and then let you dispute is not accepted,
00:21:10 it's like a strike or something.
00:21:12 Yeah.
00:21:13 Yeah.
00:21:14 Yeah.
00:21:15 So he can't do that for 150 videos.
00:21:18 Like saying,
00:21:19 this is fucked up.
00:21:20 Toei, please.
00:21:22 He made a big video pleading with Toei in Japanese.
00:21:28 He hired somebody to speak in Japanese to them
00:21:31 so that they could understand why this was bad,
00:21:34 why this is bad for him,
00:21:35 and being able to pay,
00:21:37 you know,
00:21:38 all that stuff.
00:21:39 And then,
00:21:40 I guess anxiety got to him.
00:21:44 He made a third video.
00:21:45 I don't remember exactly what was said,
00:21:49 but it was sort of like,
00:21:50 it wasn't backtracking, I guess,
00:21:52 but he was like,
00:21:53 not really able to deal with the hubbub that was caused.
00:21:58 Yeah.
00:21:59 What does that mean?
00:22:00 Well, the thing is,
00:22:01 we didn't expect this thing to blow up.
00:22:04 First of all,
00:22:05 like even PewDiePie made a video about it.
00:22:11 Like we wasn't expecting that.
00:22:15 Okay.
00:22:16 You gotta understand from a point of view of a person
00:22:20 that is not really used to deal with internet shed.
00:22:24 Like,
00:22:25 he's also a really nice guy.
00:22:27 He's not prepared for the internet at all.
00:22:29 So,
00:22:30 he just,
00:22:31 What are you talking about?
00:22:32 He's a YouTuber with 680k subscribers.
00:22:35 Exactly.
00:22:36 That's exactly the one thing that is,
00:22:40 people is getting wrong.
00:22:41 Like,
00:22:42 because someone has like a huge following,
00:22:46 they immediately think,
00:22:48 like this guy is a,
00:22:50 I don't know,
00:22:51 is a massive YouTuber,
00:22:52 because I don't know,
00:22:53 he's some kind of an enterprise on its own.
00:22:57 He's used to the internet shed and stuff,
00:23:00 but he's not.
00:23:01 We do videos,
00:23:02 videos get views and immediately,
00:23:05 suddenly out of nowhere,
00:23:06 100k subs just coming to the channel.
00:23:11 But because we had,
00:23:13 like we have a huge channel,
00:23:15 doesn't mean like we're prepared to deal with the pressure of that.
00:23:20 You know?
00:23:21 Sure, sure.
00:23:22 I'm like him and the anxiety stuff,
00:23:26 not being able to deal with it.
00:23:27 I don't think it's too much of like a problem in and of itself.
00:23:31 I don't expect that.
00:23:33 I just feel like,
00:23:37 it's like maybe a mistake to shy away from a community that's trying to support.
00:23:43 Like, I feel like a boycott of Toei is based personally.
00:23:46 I think that's cool,
00:23:48 because they're fucking,
00:23:50 they're fucking with this channel.
00:23:52 They're abusing content ID.
00:23:54 YouTube needs to,
00:23:56 you know, everyone knows YouTube sucks with the content ID robots and stuff.
00:24:00 I feel like it's beneficial for YouTubers and,
00:24:06 and you know, audience members and just people for this to be like,
00:24:13 I don't know, taken as far as it can go,
00:24:17 like make enough of a stink that actually something does change.
00:24:20 Yeah.
00:24:21 But the thing is, like from my perspective,
00:24:23 like the day this happened,
00:24:25 I got so anxious that I had a panic attack.
00:24:29 Really bad.
00:24:31 I had to go to the hospital and stuff because the whole,
00:24:34 like this whole thought of maybe the channels is going to stop existing.
00:24:39 Like maybe they're going to strike it.
00:24:41 Maybe I'm going to lose my job.
00:24:43 It just, it just got me.
00:24:45 It just got me and it was really hard these days to stay positive.
00:24:49 It was really, really hard.
00:24:50 You have no fucking idea how hard was to like wake up every day and remember like,
00:24:57 yeah, right.
00:24:58 This happened.
00:24:59 Fuck.
00:25:00 How do I deal with this?
00:25:02 How do we deal with this?
00:25:04 So as for me personally speaking,
00:25:08 like if I was Mark,
00:25:10 I probably going to do the same thing.
00:25:11 Like I couldn't, I couldn't understand the pressure.
00:25:14 Okay.
00:25:15 To be honest.
00:25:16 Well, I, but the pressure to do what?
00:25:21 Like what, like what does, what does be it?
00:25:24 Okay.
00:25:25 What, what exactly does making a video where you throw up your hands and you go,
00:25:28 never mind.
00:25:29 Like what, what does that do?
00:25:31 What does that change about the situation?
00:25:33 How does that relieve any of the pressure?
00:25:36 Being like that feeling that you're suddenly in the center of the world and everybody is watching you.
00:25:43 And you're getting notifications all day, every day about it.
00:25:47 And you have like a,
00:25:49 It doesn't, it doesn't fix that.
00:25:51 It doesn't fix that problem.
00:25:53 What problem, Ben?
00:25:55 That, that problem, I, the one you were just describing,
00:25:58 think about being, getting too many notifications and it, it's upsetting.
00:26:02 Like it doesn't, it doesn't fix that.
00:26:04 It's not like it's upsetting, Ben.
00:26:07 I mean, I don't know how, I don't know how I even explain it to you.
00:26:13 Like if you don't understand how, how is to deal with this sort of this,
00:26:18 this level of anxiety, right?
00:26:20 This level of depression.
00:26:21 If you don't know how to, how it is to deal with that every day,
00:26:25 with all this pressure of the entire world just surrounding you out of nowhere.
00:26:29 Like it is really hard.
00:26:31 I'm just saying, I don't, I don't, I don't see how making a video where you're like,
00:26:37 where you just say, oops, never mind.
00:26:40 Like I don't see why that relieves any of that pressure or solves the problem.
00:26:44 It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't make the, it doesn't make the, the strikes go away.
00:26:50 It doesn't like take attention off of you, really.
00:26:53 Exactly.
00:26:54 It doesn't.
00:26:57 So the move is just to move on.
00:26:59 Cause how can you fight a multi-billionaire company that can strike and delete your channel anytime?
00:27:08 I mean, how?
00:27:10 Yeah, it's, it seems, it's, it's hard to do that.
00:27:16 When we, we got a like a few videos blocked in the past and they,
00:27:22 it took around a whole year to get them back in the channel.
00:27:27 Imagine like how much will it take to fight for 150 videos.
00:27:34 We did the math and it would take around 37 years.
00:27:39 And honestly, with this fucked up system, when YouTube doesn't want to help also,
00:27:46 just reminder that they don't want to help.
00:27:50 They do not want to help.
00:27:52 So we kind of have to fight for our own, for our own.
00:27:58 And you can't just go to trial with toe animation.
00:28:01 I mean, it's fucking toe animation.
00:28:04 Well, all right.
00:28:05 I have, I have a thing to say about that then.
00:28:09 I think like boycotts are legal.
00:28:12 Like, are to a able to shut you down because you're saying boycott or are implied to say boycott?
00:28:20 Cause like, like, I'm, like, I'm honestly confused.
00:28:23 Like, what is the problem because like, is it, is it that you said boycott until he was mad and going to threaten legal action?
00:28:29 Or is it just, or is the decision like, okay, well, I'm simply just not going to challenge it.
00:28:35 And I'm just going to let the videos that are down stay down.
00:28:39 Yeah.
00:28:42 All right.
00:28:43 Cause why would he, we don't want that.
00:28:46 We don't want to fight for 37 years.
00:28:49 I mean, I don't know.
00:28:50 It's not, it's not, it's not my business.
00:28:52 I don't know.
00:28:53 I mean, it's not my business, whether he decides to challenge the strikes or not, or the takedowns.
00:28:58 It's not mine either.
00:28:59 I mean, I just, I'm just the editor of the channel.
00:29:02 If he wants to, if he wants to prioritize his mental health, I think that's not, that's not wrong.
00:29:10 And I think a lot of people understand.
00:29:12 I don't care about it.
00:29:13 I don't care about the mental health, like whatever.
00:29:16 It's, it's either way, it's his decision.
00:29:19 Whatever.
00:29:20 It's beside the point.
00:29:22 Like, I'm not saying, I'm not saying he, nobody is saying like, oh no, he has to fight the strikes.
00:29:27 He has to put his channel in jeopardy.
00:29:29 Like, I don't care about that.
00:29:31 I don't know.
00:29:33 I get, it's, it's, it's, I don't even know what I'm arguing anymore.
00:29:39 I don't even know, I don't even know what we're talking about.
00:29:42 I think the mark probably needs like a spokesperson or a manager to deal.
00:29:49 Like if, if he's getting anxiety from this, I don't know how you get a manager or anything.
00:29:55 But like, I'm imagining the sort of person who like, you got your artist, your, whatever,
00:30:00 a musician and he's like, oh shit, I'm stressed and you got your big manager with big fists
00:30:05 and he points his hand, his big meaty hand at like, people who are fucking with him.
00:30:10 And he says, fuck you, treat him right.
00:30:12 You need people like that.
00:30:14 You know, you need a guy like that on your team.
00:30:16 You need a manager to like punch and take all the brunt of stuff.
00:30:20 It's actually something we did at DA games.
00:30:25 Like Will used to be in charge of everything, but he has a lot of like anxiety issues.
00:30:31 And there'd be a lot of points where he would like, if he was having like a really like, like bad time,
00:30:37 he would like be like, oh, no, maybe I should delete the channel.
00:30:41 Maybe I should do this or that.
00:30:42 And he would make all the social media go black and do that thing.
00:30:45 And we're just like, God, no, don't do that, please.
00:30:49 What was the guy in Bakuman?
00:30:51 Like the manga about manga.
00:30:54 And there was that guy who was like, ah, shit, I don't want to do anything.
00:30:58 And he had that manager.
00:30:59 It's like, just do it, idiot.
00:31:00 And he's like, oh my God.
00:31:02 You mean the guy with the suspenders?
00:31:04 Yeah, he was really good.
00:31:06 The guy who drew Otters 11.
00:31:10 Otters 11, yeah.
00:31:12 Well, that was his editor.
00:31:14 Editor's art.
00:31:15 It's funny to say that.
00:31:17 He was my favorite.
00:31:18 Can I forget his name?
00:31:20 Yeah.
00:31:21 It's funny to say like, because the manager who got at DA games also is seen wearing suspenders.
00:31:27 No, no, no, no, nothing.
00:31:30 The manager, he, the artist guy wore suspenders.
00:31:32 He was the businessman who like retired to draw manga and he had the long hair
00:31:36 and he wore suspenders most of the time.
00:31:38 Wearing suspenders is pretty sus.
00:31:42 Oh my God.
00:31:45 In any case, we had one of our other friends who was on the team
00:31:49 who was very like mentally stable and based, I guess, just like take over the social media
00:31:56 and take over like organizing everyone and telling like all the artists,
00:31:59 okay, you're going to work on this, you're going to work on that,
00:32:01 keeping deadlines, that sort of thing.
00:32:03 And taking that pressure off of Will who's like the face of the channel
00:32:06 so that he can have a better time and it's been good.
00:32:10 So it can be a good idea to do that.
00:32:12 Yeah.
00:32:13 No, I know what you mean that like this is everything is so new.
00:32:20 Like we actually weren't prepared at all for this kind of situation
00:32:24 because we never expected that one day we're just going to wake up
00:32:28 and see that 150 videos were just going to be deleted
00:32:32 and then making a video about it like an updating the situation
00:32:37 will like trigger this reaction in YouTube in general.
00:32:44 Like we weren't expecting that we weren't prepared for that.
00:32:47 We weren't mentally prepared for that.
00:32:50 I think this experience is a learning experience to be honest.
00:32:55 Like if ever happens again in the future, we also need to,
00:33:01 I mean, I don't know what we're going to do.
00:33:03 We're probably going to change the entire format of the channel.
00:33:06 Probably we're going to move on to something different.
00:33:09 But yeah.
00:33:14 Okay.
00:33:15 I lost track of what I was saying.
00:33:19 In my opinion, in my opinion, okay.
00:33:23 Anxiety or no.
00:33:25 I think objectively speaking, if a company does something bad to you
00:33:31 and then you make an announcement and you're like, hey,
00:33:34 company did something bad and then it makes a big,
00:33:39 there's a big reaction, there's a big community like outcry about it.
00:33:43 Like setting aside how you feel about that
00:33:46 or if it makes you anxious or whatever.
00:33:49 I think that's just good.
00:33:51 That's just like a good thing that you want to happen
00:33:54 and that is good for you.
00:33:56 Like the initial thing, yeah, it's bad that the videos are taken down
00:33:58 and maybe it's, maybe, you know, maybe, yeah,
00:34:01 the consequences of fighting it might be bad and not worth it
00:34:06 and risky and you don't want to do it
00:34:08 because it's like a bad decision for the survival of the channel.
00:34:11 That all makes sense and is good.
00:34:14 But I think when the community is mad about what company did to you,
00:34:19 it's smarter to lean into it.
00:34:22 I think Gibb, you were saying something kind of similar before.
00:34:27 It just doesn't make sense to me at all.
00:34:30 Not like the technical aspect of it,
00:34:34 just like the way that it is being talked about doesn't add up.
00:34:43 Yeah, I think that point of view is right.
00:34:50 But personally, if it was me, I just wouldn't be capable to keep going.
00:34:56 So I guess it depends of your mental strength
00:35:01 or your personal situation.
00:35:03 I know Mark has some personal issues too, so I don't know.
00:35:09 Well, the thing is, to close this topic, I guess,
00:35:14 I don't know if you could keep talking about it,
00:35:16 but when I talked to you the other day to talk about the situation,
00:35:22 I was hoping to get into the podcast and talk about,
00:35:28 hey, we should keep pressing Toei and stuff.
00:35:33 I wasn't expecting that.
00:35:35 Mark was going to feel so...
00:35:38 I didn't know he was feeling so bad.
00:35:41 When I talked with him the other day, I was like,
00:35:45 shit, he's feeling really bad.
00:35:48 I guess I understand.
00:35:50 I honestly wanted to keep going.
00:35:54 I wanted to keep going.
00:35:55 I was amazed at the...
00:35:59 When you say keep going, you mean pressing Toei.
00:36:03 You mean pressing Toei publicly,
00:36:07 or you mean YouTube behind the scenes, like challenge.
00:36:11 Publicly, yeah.
00:36:12 I mean, I even was doing my own silent protest.
00:36:15 I do a lot of fun art of Toei shows.
00:36:19 I said on Twitter, you know what?
00:36:21 I'm just going to stop doing this until this situation is fixed or whatever.
00:36:25 But Mark is my boss, yeah, but he's also my friend,
00:36:31 so I need to sympathize with him.
00:36:35 I understand.
00:36:36 I understand because I will do the same thing.
00:36:40 I wouldn't be capable of keep going with all this.
00:36:43 I'm not... I don't think anyone should...
00:36:46 It was the first time it came out of nowhere.
00:36:51 Out of nowhere.
00:36:52 In one hour, our entire lives changed.
00:36:56 Yeah.
00:36:57 It is understandable, but at the same time,
00:37:01 it is an experience to learn from
00:37:05 and to get better at managing this kind of situation
00:37:09 if it ever happens in the future.
00:37:12 What have we learned?
00:37:15 I guess to manage the kind of situation better, I suppose.
00:37:22 I would not hire a thug, get a mercenary with like brass knuckles
00:37:28 and like a sloped forehead
00:37:30 and tell him that he has to punch people on the internet,
00:37:34 and he'll do it.
00:37:36 Yeah.
00:37:38 But we'll see.
00:37:40 I mean, for now, he's having a rest.
00:37:44 We're going to talk about it later.
00:37:46 Here's what I think probably...
00:37:49 Here's what's...
00:37:51 You know, this is...
00:37:53 I think at some point probably...
00:37:56 All right, I'm just going to say it.
00:37:58 I think he's probably going to come to his senses
00:38:00 and be like, no, wait, we actually should...
00:38:03 We actually should keep talking about this,
00:38:05 and then it'll just be back,
00:38:07 because I think that's the thing that makes more sense.
00:38:10 To be honest, I think the best way to move on,
00:38:15 it's still animation.
00:38:17 It's like you're fighting it,
00:38:19 the ant versus the elephant.
00:38:22 I mean...
00:38:23 Situation.
00:38:25 Well, I guess, but like...
00:38:28 Is the fear that they're going to strike even more of your videos?
00:38:33 The fear is that they strike the channel.
00:38:37 Well, yeah.
00:38:39 That's the thing, the YouTube system is so weird
00:38:43 that they give all this power to these big corporations
00:38:46 that they can do anything they want with your channel.
00:38:49 And you, as a creator, can do absolutely anything.
00:38:53 YouTube won't help.
00:38:55 There are no legal help or anything
00:38:59 that can do anything for you.
00:39:01 It's stupid.
00:39:03 The only...
00:39:05 There's a proper solution,
00:39:07 which is getting a YouTube manager
00:39:10 that can give you the ability to
00:39:13 block the videos of the channel on Japan.
00:39:17 But getting one of those managers
00:39:19 is like you have to have inner friends
00:39:22 in the inner circle of YouTube
00:39:24 to actually get a manager.
00:39:25 It's really stupidly hard to get one.
00:39:29 So...
00:39:31 I mean, okay.
00:39:33 A channel as big as Marx, though,
00:39:35 I feel like it would be easier than most
00:39:39 to get some YouTube attention.
00:39:42 I feel like it's...
00:39:44 I mean, the procrastinator's tiny channel in comparison.
00:39:49 We yelled about stuff that happened to us
00:39:52 when our channel got deleted once.
00:39:55 I think it was just once.
00:39:57 We yelled about it on Twitter and we did get response.
00:40:00 For months and months we did, yeah.
00:40:02 It took a while, but I feel like it's possible
00:40:06 to get the Toei thing.
00:40:08 Because I feel like Toei is a giant company.
00:40:11 They're so giant, they probably didn't even notice
00:40:14 anything was happening.
00:40:16 Just do a YouTube sweep.
00:40:19 We need to do that.
00:40:21 And then a guy pressed one button
00:40:23 and he just scanned YouTube for things.
00:40:25 This channel has a lot of Dragon Ball in the title.
00:40:27 I do that.
00:40:29 And it was just a robot doing it.
00:40:31 I feel like if YouTube reinstated a bunch of them,
00:40:35 if you could get in contact with YouTube somehow,
00:40:37 cause enough of a stink on Twitter,
00:40:39 other social medias,
00:40:41 and then get YouTube to be like,
00:40:43 okay, I guess we should look into this
00:40:45 because the community is outraged.
00:40:47 They usually respond if the outrage is large enough.
00:40:50 And then they may be able to put
00:40:54 most of the majority of the videos back,
00:40:56 or all of them.
00:40:58 And then Toei will probably just not even notice.
00:41:01 I feel like they're not really that involved.
00:41:05 I don't foresee them coming down with a real lawyer
00:41:09 and being like, all right, time to kill you
00:41:11 with an assassin.
00:41:13 That's the weird thing,
00:41:15 because I think Toei has been targeting the channel
00:41:19 for quite some time.
00:41:22 They blocked some videos.
00:41:24 We got them back after almost a year,
00:41:26 and then they blocked them again.
00:41:29 So they slowly and progressively
00:41:35 started to block first two videos,
00:41:38 then five videos, then 10 videos,
00:41:40 and out of nowhere 150,
00:41:42 but they've been like targeting the channel
00:41:46 for quite some time.
00:41:47 I guess the channel is on the radar,
00:41:50 I don't know.
00:41:52 But Toei's animation as a corporation
00:41:56 is really fucked up how it works,
00:41:58 because it's like,
00:42:02 animation and production is really cool and great
00:42:05 and all that.
00:42:07 But in terms of corporate,
00:42:09 it kind of sucks because they still live
00:42:11 in the 20th century.
00:42:14 I think it's managed mostly by lizards,
00:42:20 like just old guys that just won't like you.
00:42:24 They will block videos with people that,
00:42:29 I don't know, you know those videos
00:42:31 of one guy talking to the camera
00:42:33 and suddenly, I don't know,
00:42:35 they have a poster of Dragon Ball in the back.
00:42:39 They will block videos like that.
00:42:42 They will block videos like one guy saying one piece once
00:42:46 in the entire thing.
00:42:48 They will do that.
00:42:49 And they do that.
00:42:51 We got several comments of people,
00:42:54 of other smaller content creators,
00:42:57 they have this problem,
00:42:59 they have this problem where they do fun arts
00:43:02 and some guy draws Goku or Luffy or something,
00:43:06 and they get the video blocked
00:43:08 and then they get it back
00:43:09 and they're blocking again and again
00:43:11 and they keep blocking it.
00:43:13 So, I don't know, they're weird.
00:43:15 Such a weird company.
00:43:17 Yep.
00:43:19 This is like Disney.
00:43:21 It's a lot, yeah, Disney and Nintendo
00:43:24 and a lot of companies do that.
00:43:27 They just claim stuff
00:43:30 and there's no real consequences for them
00:43:33 if they are overly aggressive in the videos
00:43:36 that they claim, infringe their copyright or whatever.
00:43:40 This is a problem you hear.
00:43:42 Big enabler of those big companies
00:43:47 because they don't want to get sued
00:43:50 so they'd rather just fuck the user base.
00:43:53 Yeah.
00:43:54 Shift the blame.
00:43:56 One sec, I need seltzer water.
00:43:59 Okay.
00:44:01 KGB.
00:44:03 Boy.
00:44:04 So, yeah.
00:44:06 Anime.
00:44:09 What is it?
00:44:11 Black cherry.
00:44:13 Delicious.
00:44:15 Okay, so what's up?
00:44:17 What did I miss?
00:44:19 Nothing, I just said anime.
00:44:22 What is it?
00:44:24 It's...
00:44:25 And manga.
00:44:27 You probably want a boy
00:44:31 working with anime on YouTube.
00:44:34 It is a Japanese colloquialism, after all.
00:44:37 Impossible, impossible.
00:44:39 It's true, but true.
00:44:42 I wish that YouTube would just stop being a little bitch
00:44:48 and I also think we should do a abolished copyright.
00:44:52 That's over and above the YouTube situation.
00:44:55 But it's true.
00:44:57 They should improve the system.
00:44:59 The PewDiePie...
00:45:01 Yeah, that's a good start.
00:45:03 The PewDiePie made about the whole Mark situation.
00:45:06 He also tells like...
00:45:08 He can't use his own music in his own videos
00:45:11 because YouTube claims he is music.
00:45:14 Like what?
00:45:16 Who is music?
00:45:18 PewDiePie.
00:45:20 PewDiePie.
00:45:22 PewDiePie makes music like an artist
00:45:26 makes an album and he can't use that music
00:45:29 or what sort of music exists.
00:45:31 Hold on, that makes no sense because...
00:45:33 Exactly.
00:45:35 I know a bit about how that system works
00:45:37 and they're supposed to like let you
00:45:39 whitelist certain channels yourself.
00:45:41 Like you're supposed to have control of that
00:45:43 because GA Games does a lot of music
00:45:45 and they've whitelisted certain channels
00:45:47 to use their content.
00:45:48 They've whitelisted my channel,
00:45:49 they've whitelisted a few of the other team members
00:45:52 and those videos don't get claimed by the bot
00:45:55 or at least we're not supposed to.
00:45:57 So why can't...
00:45:59 Why does a PewDiePie have access to that?
00:46:01 PewDiePie says something about like another company
00:46:03 claiming his music.
00:46:05 Oh well that happens all the time.
00:46:07 A company is just falsely claiming ownership.
00:46:10 There's no filter for that.
00:46:12 Like I did some streams of Hollow Knight
00:46:14 and the Team Cherry is explicitly said on their website
00:46:18 Hollow Knight, you can use the footage,
00:46:20 you can use the music, you can just use everything.
00:46:22 We love them.
00:46:24 And then third-party companies will just
00:46:27 say they own the soundtrack to Hollow Knight
00:46:31 because they distributed it in like Taiwan or something.
00:46:35 So they claim it and I can't do anything about that.
00:46:39 I can fight it and eventually they'll say
00:46:41 they'll do nothing about it but it's like...
00:46:44 It's stupid.
00:46:46 You'll know that but what can be done?
00:46:49 These companies never respond.
00:46:51 They never respond.
00:46:55 I probably don't even hire a single person
00:46:58 to do any of that.
00:47:00 I mean...
00:47:02 Remember...
00:47:04 Sorry, sorry.
00:47:06 I interrupted.
00:47:08 No that's okay, I burped and I forgot what I was going to say.
00:47:11 Okay.
00:47:13 Remember when Mumki got his channel deleted
00:47:17 and immediately he was like more popular
00:47:21 than he'd ever been before and like Keemstar
00:47:23 was making videos about him and stuff?
00:47:26 Yes.
00:47:28 In my experience it's just good
00:47:31 when bad things happen to your YouTube channel
00:47:34 and then people talk about it.
00:47:36 Not necessarily in Mumki's case.
00:47:39 He's never regained all those subscribers.
00:47:42 Okay, well in Mumki's case...
00:47:44 He's still less than half the amount he had years later.
00:47:47 Well yes, his subscriber count.
00:47:50 Yeah, but I mean that was...
00:47:52 He could have played his cards differently.
00:47:54 True, I mean he did kind of fuck up everything else.
00:47:58 The channel could have grown more
00:48:00 if he hadn't fucked up everything else, you're right.
00:48:02 Yeah, yeah.
00:48:04 I don't know.
00:48:06 When PewDiePie is making a video about
00:48:09 your situation about how a company fucked you over
00:48:13 that's what you want.
00:48:15 That's like the dream.
00:48:18 That's the dream of the YouTuber
00:48:21 as far as I'm concerned.
00:48:24 I can assume that the drawcast got some kind of boost
00:48:27 after we got deleted and came back.
00:48:30 What's that?
00:48:32 I can assume that the drawcast got some kind of boost
00:48:34 after YouTube deleted us and then we came back.
00:48:37 Maybe, probably.
00:48:39 I was assuming a little bit.
00:48:42 I mean it's really just the case of people
00:48:45 who otherwise would not say the name of a channel
00:48:48 are all saying the name of a channel at once
00:48:51 and so a lot of people who have never heard of it
00:48:53 are hearing about it.
00:48:55 Because I knew of Totally Not Mark through Kaiju
00:48:59 but I didn't really watch their videos
00:49:01 and I forgot, I didn't realize it was the same guy
00:49:05 when this stuff all started happening.
00:49:09 I was like, wait a minute, that profile picture he has
00:49:12 looks familiar.
00:49:14 I figured it out.
00:49:16 It's Zorro.
00:49:18 No.
00:49:20 I didn't think it is.
00:49:22 It was a contest
00:49:27 of making a fan art of Mark in the One Piece style.
00:49:31 Yeah, he looks mostly like Luffy
00:49:34 but a little different.
00:49:36 No, he looks like Zorro.
00:49:38 It's like a Luffy Zorro.
00:49:40 He's just Zorro but he's sticking his tongue out.
00:49:43 The artist that drew that is like,
00:49:46 he draws really accurate One Piece art.
00:49:49 It's really good.
00:49:51 I forgot the name sadly.
00:49:53 Oh yeah, it's Zorro.
00:49:57 Lots of people have now learned about
00:50:01 Totally Not Mark
00:50:03 and so that's why it would grow
00:50:05 if it had been deleted and come back
00:50:10 there would be more people, new people.
00:50:15 And that's why it's a good thing to happen
00:50:18 but it's not like a preferable thing.
00:50:20 I think you can grow perfectly fine without it happening.
00:50:23 Yeah, that's the thing.
00:50:25 It's like a little boost.
00:50:26 It's like a Mario Kart boost on the track
00:50:28 if you're in 12th place and you go,
00:50:30 maybe you'll get a little further.
00:50:33 It depends on the person really.
00:50:36 Personally, I wouldn't like to grow up as an artist
00:50:42 because of some tragedy, honestly.
00:50:46 Well, whatever.
00:50:48 We're not all you, Ben.
00:50:55 We are different.
00:50:58 You are dumb if you think this is a me thing.
00:51:01 I'm just saying, look, when you're a YouTuber,
00:51:04 you live and die on the numbers
00:51:06 and things like this make a number go up
00:51:09 and that's really the long and short of it.
00:51:11 Yeah, but again, it depends on the person, honestly.
00:51:15 I mean, it would be bad if your 600k YouTube channel
00:51:20 were erased and you had to start a new one.
00:51:23 That would probably be pretty bad
00:51:25 and maybe would probably...
00:51:27 It depends, but it would probably offset
00:51:31 any signal boost that you get from something like this.
00:51:35 Perhaps, possibly, probably, most likely, maybe.
00:51:41 There was a YouTuber who didn't have his house burned down,
00:51:47 but it did, and he was one of the big fires
00:51:50 in California or something,
00:51:52 and he was a science, something I can't remember his name.
00:51:57 But he lived in a van for a while,
00:52:00 and he kept making videos,
00:52:02 and people, the support definitely helped
00:52:06 regrow what was destroyed.
00:52:10 So, tragedy is big money,
00:52:14 and you should try to burn your house down.
00:52:17 You should seek to create...
00:52:19 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:52:21 You should live as dangerously as you can
00:52:24 and hope that something bad happens to you.
00:52:30 I'm glad we all learned a valuable lesson today.
00:52:33 You got to show your Patreon.
00:52:35 The trick is when this happens, you got to show your Patreon.
00:52:37 Oh, wait, it happened to Teleprte, too, didn't it?
00:52:39 Because his channel was growing pretty fast
00:52:41 at the beginning of the year,
00:52:43 and then YouTube deleted him over some bullshit.
00:52:46 They said his videos were too sexual,
00:52:49 but the videos they flagged had nothing in them,
00:52:52 and when people kicked up a statement,
00:52:55 when he came back...
00:52:57 His whole channel got deleted for a couple of days.
00:53:00 I remember that, yeah, I remember that.
00:53:02 And then when he came back, his growth was quadruple
00:53:06 what it was before.
00:53:08 Did he have to start a new one, or did he get the old one?
00:53:10 No, no, no, he got his old channel back,
00:53:12 but he had slowly climbed up to around 1 or 200k or something.
00:53:16 But when it came back, he shot up triple that in no time at all.
00:53:21 Yeah.
00:53:22 So, yeah, that also happened.
00:53:24 I forgot about that.
00:53:28 I remember that happening.
00:53:30 On the topic of finances of content creators and things,
00:53:34 I've had something interesting happen in the last day.
00:53:38 Since the last...
00:53:40 Yeah.
00:53:42 My Patreon, patreon.com slash oblivionfall,
00:53:46 was fluctuating around 250 and 253 dollars
00:53:50 back and forth for two weeks.
00:53:52 It couldn't decide what it would settle on.
00:53:54 And then yesterday, it just jumped up by over 30 dollars
00:54:00 out of nowhere, and I have no idea why,
00:54:03 and I'm almost catching up to patreon.com slash bansane.
00:54:08 I'm only a couple of dollars behind you.
00:54:10 This is a tragedy.
00:54:11 I'm going to have to give you money if I surpass you.
00:54:13 This is bullshit.
00:54:15 That is a big problem.
00:54:17 That would just be terrible if you had to do that,
00:54:20 according to the contract that everyone with the Patreon...
00:54:23 According to the blood pact, yeah.
00:54:25 Oof.
00:54:26 Yeah, this, yeah, yeah.
00:54:28 What a terrible thing to happen.
00:54:31 Maybe when Phantom's Revenge comes out,
00:54:34 people like that, and I'll get a boost or not.
00:54:38 Good, good, good.
00:54:39 Who knows?
00:54:41 I pray.
00:54:42 Did you put anything out that did that to you, or what?
00:54:46 I put something out on the last day of last month,
00:54:49 and I haven't put anything out since.
00:54:51 I've been silent, so...
00:54:54 No boost in viewership on my videos.
00:54:56 I checked my analytics after it happened,
00:54:58 and they're the same as normal, so I have no idea.
00:55:02 Oh, wow, yeah, you're almost...
00:55:04 Yeah, you're only a few dollars behind me now.
00:55:07 Oh, God.
00:55:08 No!
00:55:09 Stop!
00:55:11 No, stop having money.
00:55:13 Only I can do that.
00:55:14 Stop having money.
00:55:15 Quit it.
00:55:16 Stop.
00:55:17 Makes me mad.
00:55:18 I don't want to give Ben Saint my money, jeez.
00:55:19 I definitely don't want you to do that
00:55:21 at patreon.com slash ben saint.
00:55:24 From patreon.com slash oblivionfall.
00:55:27 Yes.
00:55:28 patreon.com slash give and take.
00:55:31 That wasn't funny.
00:55:33 That was terrible.
00:55:34 I was waiting for Kaiju.
00:55:37 Yeah.
00:55:39 So, yeah, oblivion, you...
00:55:42 Last week, you had a bunch of shit.
00:55:45 You were describing...
00:55:47 You said there was a developing situation,
00:55:49 and then immediately after the episode,
00:55:51 you said, like, guess what?
00:55:53 The shit is even worse than you could possibly imagine now.
00:55:58 Oh, God.
00:55:59 Yes.
00:56:00 Do you want to, like...
00:56:01 There after the episode, so please explain everything.
00:56:03 Yeah, I'll recap.
00:56:05 So, my month, starting December 1st, was crazy.
00:56:08 The first day, my job at Pennsylvania
00:56:11 that I've had for three years, just poof, gone in an instant.
00:56:15 Yes.
00:56:16 And, oh, that was spooky.
00:56:19 And then the second day, the Twitter drama
00:56:22 and regarding the plagiarism of my friend's character,
00:56:25 I also talked about that.
00:56:27 Yes.
00:56:28 And then the third day was the thing
00:56:31 that I was considering talking about.
00:56:33 I've changed my mind because I think it's a bit too much
00:56:36 of a personal situation, and since then, I've learned more.
00:56:38 There's more grays going on.
00:56:40 No.
00:56:41 But that involves some stuff.
00:56:44 It involves some very fucked-up individuals, in my opinion.
00:56:48 But I probably shouldn't rag on them publicly.
00:56:51 Maybe it's not the best move.
00:56:53 Bonus episode material.
00:56:55 No, the fourth day, there was just family drama
00:56:59 that from, like, six years ago that got resolved.
00:57:02 That was a thing.
00:57:03 The fifth day, December 5th, this is the new big thing.
00:57:08 So, every single day, it was some new bullshit.
00:57:11 And, yeah, so, on the 5th or 6th, maybe.
00:57:15 I found out through my sister, who works for my mom,
00:57:21 who, you know, is a lawyer in New Zealand,
00:57:25 that a whole bunch of churches, a whole big fuck-ton of them,
00:57:30 including all the big mega-churches, including individuals
00:57:35 such as Peter Mortlock and Brian Tamaki,
00:57:38 who are these crazy nutjobs.
00:57:42 God, I could, I guess, briefly sum up what those people are like.
00:57:47 Peter Mortlock is one of those people who thinks that
00:57:50 COVID restrictions are just like what they did to the Jews
00:57:54 in Nazi Germany.
00:57:55 It's identical.
00:57:56 He's one of those people.
00:57:57 Right, right.
00:57:58 And he's like a mega-church pastor or something?
00:58:01 Yeah, he is.
00:58:02 My sister used to rent from his son.
00:58:05 They're one of those prosperity gospel types,
00:58:08 which is like, oh, you know,
00:58:10 I'm so rich because God gives me money, sort of people.
00:58:14 Yes.
00:58:15 You just have to have faith and you'll be rich like me.
00:58:17 It's like the, yes, it's like the evangelical Christian equivalent
00:58:21 of the secret, where like...
00:58:23 Yeah, it's so fucking hateful.
00:58:25 ...only instead of fate and the universe, it's God.
00:58:28 And it's like God rewards goodness with wealth.
00:58:32 So that means that if you're rich,
00:58:34 that means it's because you're a good person and God wanted you to be.
00:58:38 And if you're poor, it just means you just have to be a better
00:58:40 and more godly person.
00:58:41 Maybe then God will give you money.
00:58:44 Like that's literally it.
00:58:46 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:58:47 You're so right.
00:58:48 You're so right.
00:58:49 I am so right.
00:58:50 I always am.
00:58:51 I always am.
00:58:52 Yeah, so...
00:58:53 My sister used to rent from his son and apparently like 70% of a year
00:58:57 they were out on luxury vacations around the world.
00:59:00 They had their like $80,000 car parked outside her tiny little shed
00:59:05 she lived in that they were charging like $450 a week
00:59:08 for her to live there when she was a single mother.
00:59:11 You know, that real Christian charity.
00:59:15 It was fucking...
00:59:16 Sure.
00:59:17 It was a shitty house.
00:59:18 We can't live on Christian charity.
00:59:20 It doesn't pay the bills.
00:59:23 So that's like Peter Mortlock.
00:59:25 Brian Tamaki is like...
00:59:27 He's the leader of Destiny Church and he's like...
00:59:30 He's almost like a cult leader.
00:59:31 Oh my God, he has a church now?
00:59:33 Well, he's had a church.
00:59:34 It's called Destiny Church.
00:59:35 He runs it on Twitch.
00:59:36 It's what church he leads.
00:59:37 He's like this nut job.
00:59:40 He put out a bunch of DVDs about how gay people are Satan at one point.
00:59:45 DVDs?
00:59:46 DVDs.
00:59:47 Nowadays he's going on about all these conspiracy theories about the COVID.
00:59:53 It's not real.
00:59:54 It's made up by the aliens or some shit.
00:59:57 I don't know.
00:59:58 He's a crazy man.
01:00:00 So those are some of the colorful characters who are involved in this lawsuit against the
01:00:05 New Zealand government because how dare of a government say that, oh, you know, if you're
01:00:13 going to be standing in front of a congregation, you should be vaccinated or maybe not stand
01:00:18 in front of them.
01:00:19 And that's the only rule.
01:00:20 And that's a rule they have for all jobs.
01:00:22 It's not a rule they made especially for the church.
01:00:24 It's a rule they have everywhere.
01:00:28 I don't know why they can't just sit in another room with a webcam projecting their face on
01:00:33 a big screen with a speaker.
01:00:35 That would solve the problem.
01:00:37 I don't know why they can't do that.
01:00:39 They just kick him feet around.
01:00:41 What cams are Satan?
01:00:43 Yeah.
01:00:44 The justification is one separation of church and state and two.
01:00:49 Jesus said, Jesus said we have a right to congregate however we want.
01:00:54 We have a God given right to spread disease.
01:00:57 This is apartheid.
01:00:58 I've seen some of the legal documents.
01:00:59 It's stupid.
01:01:02 If Jesus were alive today, he would go around.
01:01:08 He wouldn't be laying his hands on people and curing their coronavirus.
01:01:12 He would be laying his hands on them and pulling their mask off and being like, fuck the state.
01:01:18 Breathe free, my child.
01:01:21 It's dumb.
01:01:26 The reason the most fucked up thing is one of the lawyers representing them is my mom
01:01:32 and I can't condone this.
01:01:35 I do not agree with her.
01:01:37 A lawyer representing whose mom?
01:01:40 My mother is representing these churches legally.
01:01:44 My mother is helping them through the government and I think this is fucked up and my mom should stop.
01:01:51 Also, this isn't public knowledge.
01:01:54 I'm not leaking documents.
01:01:58 For all I know, I could be telling fanciful lies.
01:02:00 Did she take the case?
01:02:02 Did she take the case?
01:02:03 Yes, I'm going to do this.
01:02:05 My mother believes in it.
01:02:07 That sucks.
01:02:09 No, bummer, dude.
01:02:13 It's just...
01:02:16 It's frustrating.
01:02:18 At Thanksgiving, this is not as bad, but at Thanksgiving, I tried to explain...
01:02:24 Did I say this before?
01:02:25 I tried to explain to my mom why I think that means testing is bad
01:02:31 and why I think it's good that the COVID relief checks,
01:02:39 why I think it's good that everybody got them
01:02:41 and how I think that universal programs are better
01:02:46 and means testing creates weird incentive structures, et cetera, et cetera.
01:02:52 And it just didn't get through to her at all.
01:02:55 She just was like,
01:02:57 Okay, but I just think that if you have more money, you shouldn't get the checks.
01:03:03 And I'm like, okay.
01:03:05 Thanks for listening.
01:03:07 Cool.
01:03:10 So it's okay.
01:03:11 My mom sucks, dude.
01:03:13 Don't worry about it.
01:03:15 Well, it's a shame because my mom used to be, in my opinion, pretty cool.
01:03:21 When I was growing up, my parents...
01:03:24 I still consider myself a Christian, I guess,
01:03:26 but my parents were much more intellectual than your typical Christian parents.
01:03:32 They were like, yeah, Harry Potter's fine.
01:03:34 Yeah, just hang out at the university.
01:03:37 They were very much more on looking at...
01:03:42 How do I explain this in brief terms?
01:03:45 Just taking an academic approach to the Bible and all that shit
01:03:53 and looking at the historical context of certain things
01:03:56 and looking at the original Hebrew meanings of words
01:03:59 and how modern-day Christianity has twisted things in stupid ways
01:04:03 and how hell doesn't actually exist.
01:04:07 Heaven's not even a thing
01:04:09 and all these misconceptions that everyone has
01:04:12 and trying to get to the roots of it,
01:04:14 which I think is way more interesting than modern Christianity,
01:04:18 especially modern American Christianity,
01:04:20 which is fucking dog shit.
01:04:24 And I don't know.
01:04:27 I feel like my mom's been talking to some weird people for the last few years
01:04:30 and she's slipping and it's not good.
01:04:37 I understand.
01:04:43 It's too bad though.
01:04:45 So that's an ongoing situation.
01:04:51 Yeah, it'll probably be public in like...
01:04:53 It's an ongoing legal battle
01:04:56 that I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.
01:05:00 I have leaked government secrets on the PCP.
01:05:03 Yes.
01:05:05 Epic.
01:05:07 Come and get us, government.
01:05:09 I had thought you were going to talk more about the black cat OC person.
01:05:15 I thought that's what it was about.
01:05:17 No, it was a different drama every day for a while.
01:05:21 Not much else has happened with that.
01:05:24 My friends just gone off Twitter because they can't handle it.
01:05:28 They're just stressed out and the other artist,
01:05:30 I haven't heard anything in a while.
01:05:32 It's just kind of gone quiet.
01:05:34 Who's gone off Twitter?
01:05:36 My friend who created the character has gone off Twitter.
01:05:40 What was her name?
01:05:42 Her name is Twi-Pi, Miss Twi-Pi Twins.
01:05:45 I can link her Twitter page for the viewers.
01:05:51 Yeah, shit's...
01:05:55 When you're not getting anything out of the internet,
01:05:58 just log off.
01:06:00 Just close the screen.
01:06:03 How can you get bullied on the internet when you can just close your eyes
01:06:07 and not look at the screen?
01:06:09 Yeah.
01:06:11 Simple.
01:06:13 Exactly.
01:06:15 That's what I was trying to say earlier.
01:06:18 But what happened with this person?
01:06:24 It was explained on a previous episode, but basically...
01:06:27 I haven't listened to that one yet.
01:06:29 Yes, damn.
01:06:31 It was last week.
01:06:33 No, two weeks ago.
01:06:35 Miss Twi-Pi made a character and there was this other person,
01:06:38 another artist who was larger than she was,
01:06:41 had a larger following, loved her OC,
01:06:44 drew it as fan art.
01:06:47 And then slowly or suddenly, I can't remember,
01:06:50 decided that they're going to make their own OC,
01:06:53 which looks exactly the same,
01:06:55 and then just call it their own character
01:06:58 Twi-Pi's character is gay, I think.
01:07:01 And then this new guy...
01:07:03 No, they made her straight.
01:07:05 They made her straight.
01:07:07 My version is identical to yours, but they're straight.
01:07:10 Yeah, and they've been a real bitch about it.
01:07:13 And like a real asshole.
01:07:16 Oh, my God.
01:07:18 Funny shit.
01:07:20 They spent like a year, like the better part of a year
01:07:22 trying to resolve it in private.
01:07:24 And the bigger artist was like,
01:07:26 oh, yeah, you know, I'll tweak the design.
01:07:28 I'll do a thing to show like the differences.
01:07:30 I'll do this and that.
01:07:32 And then he just wouldn't get back to her
01:07:34 and was mucking around and eventually just stopped
01:07:36 responding to her messages.
01:07:38 And then when we went public about it,
01:07:40 he was trying to like cover it up
01:07:42 and hide people's comments.
01:07:44 And then my friend filed a DMCA
01:07:46 and then he played the victim
01:07:48 and called my friend dumb.
01:07:50 Oh, my God.
01:07:52 And it was all very stupid.
01:07:54 Flashbacks. Yeah.
01:07:56 I've been through that.
01:07:58 In the end, it just gave up.
01:08:00 Like a...
01:08:02 Pretty much where we're at.
01:08:04 It seems like he's not remorseful at all
01:08:06 and doesn't plan on changing his way.
01:08:08 No, they will never do.
01:08:10 A few years ago, I also made a character.
01:08:14 It was just a character for illustrations,
01:08:16 not even for comics or anything.
01:08:18 A few years ago, I also just, you know,
01:08:20 my friend had a character and I thought,
01:08:22 great, and I owned them.
01:08:24 So I made a character that was the same
01:08:26 and that bitch never let me
01:08:28 hear the end of it.
01:08:30 Sorry.
01:08:32 I wasn't even Twitter, but it happened
01:08:34 over Instagram.
01:08:36 And yeah, same situation.
01:08:38 Like a huge artist
01:08:40 asked me
01:08:42 if he could draw a fan art.
01:08:44 I said yes.
01:08:46 And then he
01:08:48 stole the character, basically. That's the end.
01:08:50 I wanted to fight, but
01:08:52 same thing.
01:08:54 Same thing way too animation.
01:08:56 I just decided to just
01:08:58 fuck off. Whatever.
01:09:00 See, you and Twilight have a fatal
01:09:02 error. You made a fatal error.
01:09:04 And that is that you are good
01:09:06 at drawing nice character designs.
01:09:08 What you should do instead
01:09:10 is what I do.
01:09:12 Really stupid shitty cartoons
01:09:14 that nobody wants to copy.
01:09:16 And then you can
01:09:18 make so much merch
01:09:20 and nobody will even steal it because
01:09:22 it's like, oh, I don't care. That doesn't look good.
01:09:24 It's perfect.
01:09:26 Well, that's how
01:09:28 the NFTs
01:09:30 protect themselves from getting right-click
01:09:32 just because they look like shit and nobody wants them.
01:09:38 Did you see fucking
01:09:40 John Lennon's son
01:09:42 was like chilling some fucking
01:09:44 some skull NFTs?
01:09:46 Oh, was that actually him? Fuck.
01:09:48 Yeah, it was John Lennon and Yoko Ono's fucking son.
01:09:50 Sean Lennon
01:09:52 or something. Shilling the skulls.
01:09:54 Jeez.
01:09:56 What a fucking bitch.
01:09:58 Yeah, it was something like
01:10:00 all those monkeys or whatever
01:10:02 and lines, they look ugly, but
01:10:04 these skulls are really gonna blow your mind.
01:10:06 Why my skulls?
01:10:08 They look okay, but
01:10:10 only slightly
01:10:12 less embarrassing.
01:10:14 But they're still NFTs with a supremely
01:10:16 embarrassing by virtue of that.
01:10:18 To their credit, they did look better than
01:10:20 the board apes.
01:10:22 I'll give credit where it's due, I guess.
01:10:28 If you want to be Papyrus or Shadman
01:10:30 or something, you can buy
01:10:32 an avatar,
01:10:34 a skull avatar on the blockchain.
01:10:36 But fucking Julian Lennon wouldn't have done that.
01:10:40 Who's that?
01:10:42 The first kid.
01:10:44 Or wait.
01:10:46 Sean was with Yoko and Julian was with
01:10:48 the other
01:10:50 one.
01:10:52 They don't know much about the Beatles.
01:10:54 I know they made music at some point.
01:10:56 Child.
01:10:58 Yeah, I think so.
01:11:00 I think that's true.
01:11:02 So this is
01:11:04 internet nowadays, huh?
01:11:08 Yeah, I did see that
01:11:10 and I was like, oh god, this is weird.
01:11:12 Because it's like,
01:11:14 you always think, oh, what would it be
01:11:16 if people from the history had Twitter
01:11:18 accounts? How annoying or
01:11:20 how would I find out how terrible they are?
01:11:24 And I don't know much about Sean Lennon.
01:11:26 How could we cancel them?
01:11:28 But it's like
01:11:30 an avenue to see
01:11:32 the worst possible take a person can make
01:11:34 public, viewable.
01:11:36 And it's there.
01:11:38 It's Lennon doing it.
01:11:40 Oh god, which was the
01:11:42 which is the Monty Python guy
01:11:44 who? Eric Keitel
01:11:46 who you know is many.
01:11:48 John Cleese.
01:11:50 Yeah, John Cleese.
01:11:52 Did you see John Cleese's like woke
01:11:54 joke tweets?
01:11:56 Yeah, those didn't make sense.
01:11:58 It was like so embarrassing.
01:12:00 I'm curious.
01:12:02 He made a tweet that was like,
01:12:04 I mean, it was supposed to be ironic, but
01:12:06 a woke joke.
01:12:08 And the joke is like
01:12:10 two, three guys walk into
01:12:12 a bar.
01:12:14 One of them says like, I decry racism
01:12:16 in all its forms and the other two
01:12:18 agree.
01:12:20 And it's supposed to be like, haha, it's not funny
01:12:22 because all they said was
01:12:24 I don't like racism.
01:12:26 And it's like, yeah,
01:12:28 it's not a funny joke, John.
01:12:30 It's also like not
01:12:32 observational. Do people do that?
01:12:34 I really don't know where he gets that from.
01:12:36 Like the idea that
01:12:38 people who are
01:12:40 woke or whatever
01:12:42 tell jokes that don't have
01:12:44 punchlines or something.
01:12:46 I don't want to read too much into it, but
01:12:48 the corollary
01:12:50 to a joke like that is that is like
01:12:52 the obverse of it is, ah, yes, a joke
01:12:54 that isn't
01:12:56 a joke that is
01:12:58 self-consciously anti-racist
01:13:00 is not funny because without
01:13:02 racism, how could we have humor?
01:13:04 We've got a little bit.
01:13:06 That's totally not what he means by that
01:13:08 because that would be insane.
01:13:10 I don't think so. It's just a dumb,
01:13:12 it's just dumb. It's annoying.
01:13:14 And you know, he's old.
01:13:16 He made old movies that are really funny.
01:13:18 He basically is
01:13:20 a guy from history
01:13:22 in who's tweeting.
01:13:24 And it sucks.
01:13:26 Yeah.
01:13:28 But it's
01:13:30 a bummer.
01:13:32 Yeah, I don't know.
01:13:34 No thanks to that.
01:13:36 Sort of tangentially
01:13:38 related.
01:13:40 I guess it's like
01:13:42 stupid to have thought of the BBC
01:13:44 as like a good organization when I was younger.
01:13:46 But that was the impression I got was
01:13:48 like they know what they're
01:13:50 they're not like those
01:13:52 American Fox News people
01:13:54 that the Simpsons make fun of.
01:13:56 This is better than that.
01:13:58 Not racist. Of course it is.
01:14:00 But
01:14:02 recently
01:14:04 you may have heard of
01:14:06 the transphobic article
01:14:10 I think it went, we are being pressured
01:14:12 into sex by some trans women
01:14:14 and it's about
01:14:16 a few
01:14:18 bloggers
01:14:20 saying that
01:14:22 trans women,
01:14:24 I'm a lesbian and trans women
01:14:26 are forcing themselves on me
01:14:28 and it's not right.
01:14:30 And that's the entire article. There's no
01:14:32 trans person representation in the article.
01:14:34 I have been following
01:14:36 Sean's videos about it.
01:14:38 Sean has made a video outraged about it
01:14:40 as an encouraged people.
01:14:42 Two videos.
01:14:44 And I have gone along with those videos.
01:14:46 I've left my own complaints
01:14:48 to the BBC. The first one
01:14:50 he covered in his second video
01:14:52 which is copy pasted to a lot of
01:14:54 people. A lot of what was
01:14:56 in the thing he said was
01:14:58 given to me
01:15:00 which didn't address anything I said.
01:15:02 So I sent a second complaint
01:15:04 and I did get a response.
01:15:06 I will read a bit of it now. Hang on.
01:15:08 Just need to grab it.
01:15:10 But it was similar. I love the BBC.
01:15:12 I want to hear
01:15:14 from them.
01:15:16 I want to know what they think.
01:15:18 Thank you for getting in touch again about our article.
01:15:20 We're being pressured into sex by some trans women.
01:15:22 What a silly title.
01:15:28 There was a part in it where it was
01:15:30 clear. What I said to them
01:15:32 in my second complaint was
01:15:34 you are
01:15:36 just being transphobic.
01:15:38 And the response
01:15:40 they're giving me
01:15:42 is
01:15:44 in so many words.
01:15:46 There's too many words.
01:15:48 I'll summarize.
01:15:50 They basically say that
01:15:52 yes,
01:15:54 we understand that this is not representative
01:15:56 of the entire argument.
01:15:58 But,
01:16:00 we have done other articles
01:16:02 and this is part of a series of articles
01:16:04 like
01:16:06 discussing
01:16:08 like transgender
01:16:10 culture and stuff
01:16:12 and things that people have.
01:16:14 So really
01:16:16 we understand that
01:16:18 this article is mostly
01:16:20 like conjecture and has no
01:16:22 studies. But we made sure to mention
01:16:24 that the studies are not accurate and we
01:16:26 said a sentence that is basically
01:16:28 there's not much data to go on.
01:16:30 But the entire rest of the article
01:16:32 and the title imply
01:16:34 that there is something to go on.
01:16:36 And it's blatantly obvious
01:16:38 that this particular
01:16:40 article
01:16:42 is like
01:16:44 we've decided
01:16:46 they don't seem to understand
01:16:48 or they're trying to
01:16:50 not mention the obvious fact
01:16:52 that to make an article on a
01:16:54 topic that has no studies
01:16:56 to back it up, that has no
01:16:58 significant data
01:17:00 to make a claim
01:17:02 the decision to publish
01:17:04 that in the state
01:17:06 is like
01:17:08 clearly the intent is for people
01:17:10 it's not neutral
01:17:12 it's not neutral to publish
01:17:14 some one person said
01:17:16 that Jews are
01:17:18 terrible
01:17:20 that happens.
01:17:22 A literal fact, a person says
01:17:24 Jews are terrible. So we've decided
01:17:26 and no Jews
01:17:28 that we asked for comment
01:17:30 just decided to say anything about it.
01:17:32 So we're just gonna publish it.
01:17:34 It's technically journalism
01:17:36 to find a thing that somebody has
01:17:38 said and say this person has said it
01:17:40 there's no evidence that Jews are bad
01:17:42 people but this guy said it and we're gonna
01:17:44 put that as the title of this article
01:17:46 and we're going to assume no responsibility
01:17:48 for anything that happens
01:17:50 and it's so clear
01:17:52 that somebody in the BBC in charge
01:17:54 of this article is very steadfastly
01:17:56 transphobic and I've called
01:17:58 them out in my complaint that
01:18:00 by allowing this to stay up
01:18:02 you are just
01:18:04 infecting the rest of the BBC
01:18:06 with a transphobic
01:18:08 layer.
01:18:10 If you allow transphobia
01:18:12 to be
01:18:14 defended and published
01:18:16 then there's no part of the
01:18:18 BBC that isn't fucked.
01:18:20 So fuck the entire BBC
01:18:22 you piece of shit. I didn't say it
01:18:24 like that. I said it as
01:18:26 Britishly as I could to make them upset.
01:18:28 I said it very
01:18:30 politely and directly and
01:18:32 currently.
01:18:34 Did you say your wonkers?
01:18:36 No, Britishly
01:18:38 complaining is like
01:18:40 kind of a meme
01:18:42 because whenever a British
01:18:44 I don't know if this is the same anywhere else
01:18:46 maybe it is. But we get all haughty
01:18:48 and like upper class
01:18:50 writing. We try and use the big vocabulary
01:18:52 and we're very direct
01:18:54 we're very
01:18:56 like pointed
01:18:58 and angry but not
01:19:00 where we're swearing. We be very
01:19:02 very clear
01:19:04 and polite and they can't do anything about
01:19:06 that.
01:19:08 So I made it so that
01:19:10 they have to respond and
01:19:12 I expect nothing to happen. I expect this
01:19:14 to be like a confirmation for me at least
01:19:16 that the BBC just has
01:19:18 a transphobe in a position of power
01:19:20 that wants this to be the message
01:19:22 they're sending.
01:19:24 An illusion
01:19:26 of neutrality but mostly
01:19:28 just people, they understand
01:19:30 that people read headlines and just assume
01:19:32 they don't go into the article and find
01:19:34 the sentence that says, this article is bullshit
01:19:36 by the way. We've said that and that means
01:19:38 that it's okay to publish.
01:19:40 Nobody reads that bit.
01:19:42 Right.
01:19:44 So, yeah.
01:19:46 Fuck them.
01:19:48 BBC can eat a dick.
01:19:50 I would say the BBC is really
01:19:52 shit in the bed.
01:19:54 They're really shit in the bed on this one.
01:19:56 It's bad.
01:20:00 I did not write a letter
01:20:02 but
01:20:04 I guess I could have even though I'm not British.
01:20:06 Oh yeah, here's the sentence
01:20:08 they said, we used the word
01:20:10 some in the article
01:20:12 since that clearly does not mean most
01:20:14 nor all.
01:20:16 Others quoted in the article said, there is currently
01:20:18 little data and we don't have figures.
01:20:20 So,
01:20:22 they assume that will be enough for me to be like,
01:20:24 oh okay, you said it.
01:20:26 You did say that.
01:20:28 See how that reads to most people
01:20:30 who are dumb is,
01:20:32 oh, we don't have data so there must be even more
01:20:34 trans people doing this.
01:20:36 I can't wait for even more evidence
01:20:38 to come out about it.
01:20:40 It's incalculably high are the statistics.
01:20:42 You can't even express
01:20:44 the ratio.
01:20:46 Yeah.
01:20:48 Yeah.
01:20:50 Hmm.
01:20:52 Boo.
01:20:54 When you call them out they're like, oh well,
01:20:56 actually there's not a lot of evidence so can you really say
01:20:58 I'm wrong? It's like...
01:21:00 That's...
01:21:02 That's...
01:21:04 Someone...
01:21:06 Someone...
01:21:08 Sometimes I see a thing on Twitter
01:21:10 where someone will
01:21:12 say something about
01:21:14 like, I don't know,
01:21:16 history or foreign policy
01:21:18 or politics or something
01:21:20 and it'll be like
01:21:22 I don't know.
01:21:24 Okay, like the mainstream media, right?
01:21:26 Like,
01:21:28 fucking Rachel Maddow will say
01:21:30 you know,
01:21:32 COVID has killed, you know,
01:21:34 800,000 people
01:21:36 or whatever in America.
01:21:38 And then some idiot on Twitter
01:21:40 with an American flag
01:21:42 in their bio
01:21:44 will be like...
01:21:46 The mainstream media lies.
01:21:48 Like, the mainstream media lies
01:21:50 and therefore,
01:21:52 so I don't believe, I think the number's lower.
01:21:54 And it's like,
01:21:56 alright,
01:21:58 maybe the mainstream media does lie,
01:22:00 but like,
01:22:02 you're still basing your claim
01:22:04 off of what they're saying.
01:22:06 Like, if your reaction to their
01:22:08 like, oh no, this many people died
01:22:10 or it's not even about that,
01:22:12 just anything. Anything that the mainstream media says
01:22:14 and then you're like, oh,
01:22:16 the mainstream media said it
01:22:18 so I believe the opposite.
01:22:20 It's like, okay, well,
01:22:22 I don't know, isn't it just as bad?
01:22:24 Isn't it just as nonsensical?
01:22:26 If there's someone that you think you can't
01:22:28 trust for you to be like, okay,
01:22:30 whatever you say,
01:22:32 I'm just gonna believe the opposite.
01:22:34 Like, it's just as irrational to be like,
01:22:36 whatever you say must be false.
01:22:38 I must believe the opposite of whatever it is.
01:22:40 Right? Because...
01:22:42 I don't know.
01:22:44 It's an attitude that I see a lot.
01:22:46 People just assume
01:22:48 the opposite position because they don't like
01:22:50 what someone is saying, but really
01:22:52 if you don't trust someone's word
01:22:54 you should just take nothing from it.
01:22:56 You should just be like, well,
01:22:58 we can't make any statements
01:23:00 about this fact,
01:23:02 this subject, because
01:23:04 the person speaking on it has no credibility.
01:23:06 So there's just nothing to be gained
01:23:08 from this
01:23:10 thing that's being said.
01:23:12 I think it's probably some kind of a fallacy
01:23:14 but I don't know what fallacy it is
01:23:16 but it annoys me.
01:23:18 Yes.
01:23:20 I don't know. It reminded me
01:23:22 of that, I guess.
01:23:24 There's also the words
01:23:26 used to describe a thing
01:23:28 can very greatly influence the people's reaction.
01:23:30 If you say
01:23:32 a certain number of deaths
01:23:36 or killings
01:23:38 or murders,
01:23:40 if you use language
01:23:42 to lessen the blow
01:23:44 but still tell the truth
01:23:46 tell the truth enough
01:23:48 so that you're not actually lying
01:23:50 but make it seem like...
01:23:52 Like a police-involved shooting.
01:23:54 Yeah, something like that.
01:23:56 It's like
01:23:58 yucky.
01:24:00 Gross.
01:24:02 I'm looking at the thing again.
01:24:04 There's like a few bits.
01:24:06 We believe that seeking the view
01:24:08 of the LGBT alliance was a legitimate
01:24:10 line of inquiry.
01:24:12 Ah, yes.
01:24:14 The wording.
01:24:16 In assessing
01:24:18 if the article breached our standards
01:24:20 of harm, honour, harm, or and offence
01:24:22 we believe the use of language was proportionate.
01:24:24 Fair warning was given
01:24:26 to a strong language contained in the article.
01:24:28 Yeah, sure.
01:24:30 Just say transphobic stuff
01:24:32 and say... You were just triggered.
01:24:34 You were just triggered, snowflake.
01:24:36 What do you want a participation trophy?
01:24:38 You fucking millennial.
01:24:40 Ah!
01:24:42 That's it.
01:24:44 They're acting like you're offended
01:24:46 because they said a rude word or something.
01:24:48 Yeah, the first
01:24:50 response I got was like
01:24:52 didn't address
01:24:54 the offence stuff, like the transphobia
01:24:56 or the implications of
01:24:58 doing this without asking a trans person
01:25:00 on their position.
01:25:02 They're treating it like
01:25:04 very clearly like
01:25:06 there's only two sides to this.
01:25:08 Whether you tolerate trans people
01:25:10 and we're here to get a wide range
01:25:12 between those two points.
01:25:14 Nothing else on the other side.
01:25:16 Right, we're here to ask for compromise
01:25:18 between these two ideological
01:25:20 extremist positions
01:25:22 of tolerance
01:25:24 or not.
01:25:26 Whether you merely think trans people are
01:25:28 they don't deserve to die
01:25:30 or whether you do.
01:25:32 Nothing beyond that.
01:25:34 We're gonna thread the needle and find the nuance
01:25:36 in this situation.
01:25:38 That's so fucked.
01:25:40 They say
01:25:42 if I'm not dissatisfied
01:25:44 and I'm not, I have to go through a different thing
01:25:46 within 20 working days
01:25:48 so I have to do more
01:25:50 complaining and I will.
01:25:52 I will complain
01:25:54 until I'm blue, pink
01:25:56 and white in the face.
01:25:58 Oh, I see what you're saying.
01:26:00 That's good. That's funny.
01:26:02 Oh, yeah, I see it.
01:26:04 I'm laughing.
01:26:06 Sorry.
01:26:08 Well, does anyone have
01:26:10 any topics to raise
01:26:12 at this point
01:26:14 or should we go
01:26:16 on to voicemails?
01:26:18 I mean, we've been going for an hour and a half, I think.
01:26:20 I don't think I have much else.
01:26:24 Let me think.
01:26:26 I didn't have that much of my list this week.
01:26:28 I didn't have that much of my resources with my brain
01:26:30 because I feel like stuff happened
01:26:32 but maybe it was just Christmas
01:26:34 stress and I already talked about that.
01:26:36 All I did this week
01:26:38 was
01:26:40 Phantom's Revenge
01:26:42 and it just makes me upset
01:26:44 so I don't want to talk about it.
01:26:46 Revenge doesn't pay
01:26:48 then.
01:26:50 No, it won't.
01:26:52 Well, all it is.
01:26:54 The next episode we record
01:26:56 will be Christmas Eve
01:26:58 it'll come out.
01:27:00 Oh, really?
01:27:02 This one we're recording now
01:27:04 will come out on the 17th and then the next one
01:27:06 24th.
01:27:08 We recorded our Christmas special
01:27:10 for the drawcast
01:27:12 and since we release on Saturday
01:27:14 it'll come out on Christmas
01:27:16 so that's funny.
01:27:18 What a good day.
01:27:20 Well, that'll be a treat
01:27:22 in your stocking
01:27:24 and your little YouTube subscriber
01:27:26 subcount, subfeed stocking
01:27:28 a little gift
01:27:30 for you.
01:27:32 I am...
01:27:34 I want to get
01:27:36 so many things done
01:27:38 in the next week
01:27:40 so that I can relax,
01:27:42 enjoy Christmas week
01:27:44 from the 20th to the 23rd
01:27:46 and then to the end of the year maybe
01:27:48 just sort of winding down
01:27:50 because I feel like by being stressed
01:27:52 and having all this stuff to do
01:27:54 it would suck so much
01:27:56 if it turned January 1st
01:27:58 I need to
01:28:00 get some of this out of here
01:28:02 open a valve.
01:28:04 I feel the same.
01:28:06 I really want to
01:28:08 at least to have the beta done
01:28:10 if not by the 19th
01:28:12 which is what I really want
01:28:14 then at least by Christmas
01:28:16 or at least by New Year
01:28:18 I really want it to be over
01:28:20 or not over but I really want
01:28:22 to feel like
01:28:24 I completed something.
01:28:26 I feel like I'm able to
01:28:28 relax and then
01:28:30 I want to get back into doing some video game streams
01:28:32 because those are fun.
01:28:34 I like doing that at the end of the
01:28:36 New Year's Eve
01:28:38 streaming and then that part
01:28:40 in the stream where oh shit
01:28:42 fireworks, New Year's, happy new year
01:28:44 and then we go outside and we look at the fireworks
01:28:46 and we come back in and we continue playing.
01:28:48 I've done that for the last few years
01:28:50 I really enjoy that even if
01:28:52 I don't know if anyone watches
01:28:54 it's not New Year's for Americans yet
01:28:56 when I'm doing that
01:28:58 but it's fun.
01:29:00 I want to have that experience again
01:29:02 I want to have just chilling out
01:29:04 playing video games
01:29:06 I remember
01:29:08 video games.
01:29:10 I want to play Phantom's Revenge on Christmas
01:29:12 I want to play Phantom's Revenge live on stream
01:29:14 That's what Crack said
01:29:16 he wants Phantom's Revenge
01:29:18 in his stocking and I'm like
01:29:20 I hope I can get it
01:29:22 I hope I can deliver that
01:29:24 that would be so good.
01:29:26 You don't want to let Crack down
01:29:28 he's going to cry.
01:29:30 Absolutely.
01:29:32 Also
01:29:34 I have another
01:29:36 thing that I want to announce
01:29:38 on New Year's
01:29:40 my other secret project I feel like
01:29:42 I'm going to be able to announce that on New Year's
01:29:44 and
01:29:46 I would like to
01:29:48 announce that the Phantom's Revenge beta is done
01:29:50 and then have like a little time
01:29:52 in between that
01:29:54 to push that a little bit
01:29:56 talk about it
01:29:58 and then New Year's be like
01:30:00 oh yeah and
01:30:02 the secret project is also available

01:30:24 I'm trying so hard
01:30:26 two days ago
01:30:28 I worked all day
01:30:30 and I was on an incredible roll
01:30:32 I got on a huge roll
01:30:34 of working on the game and adding stuff
01:30:36 and like yes yes yes
01:30:38 progress progress and then yesterday
01:30:40 I wake up and I'm like
01:30:42 upset
01:30:44 and I'm like on edge
01:30:46 I couldn't get on the same roll again
01:30:48 the whole day I felt like I was just
01:30:50 banging my head against it and I was like no

01:32:54 and also
01:32:56 link in description
01:33:00 something I forgot to say
01:33:02 anything I said in this podcast
01:33:04 it's just my own personal opinion
01:33:06 my own personal take
01:33:08 listener please
01:33:10 I'm not speaking
01:33:12 anything Kaiju said
01:33:14 anything Kaiju said
01:33:16 you should assume
01:33:18 the exact opposite is true
01:33:20 you should assume the exact opposite is true
01:33:22 everything I've said is the opinion of god
01:33:24 that should be taken
01:33:26 utmost seriousness
01:33:28 you don't want to
01:33:30 disappoint god do you
01:33:32 well
01:33:34 um you know
01:33:36 wait something did happen I got
01:33:38 I think this week I got my first ever covid test
01:33:40 I had never been covid tested before
01:33:42 is the worst
01:33:44 yeah it was pretty bad
01:33:46 it was pretty uncomfortable
01:33:48 it was
01:33:50 it was not quite as bad as I thought it
01:33:52 was gonna be but it was pretty bad
01:33:54 okay what
01:33:56 is it like different from the little kits you get
01:33:58 I don't know I've never done the kit
01:34:00 oh okay
01:34:02 I've done that a couple times where you get
01:34:04 like a swab you stick it up your nose
01:34:06 and it goes really far and then you put that
01:34:08 in a little tube
01:34:10 yeah
01:34:12 is that what it's called
01:34:14 I had never gotten one before
01:34:16 with like a little fluff on the end
01:34:18 and it goes further than you could ever
01:34:20 pick your nose with a finger and it's like
01:34:22 oh my god I'm gonna hit my brain
01:34:24 no
01:34:26 it's very weird
01:34:28 it was pretty far in there
01:34:30 it didn't feel as far as
01:34:32 like the diagram made it seem like it
01:34:34 was so I was a little relieved
01:34:36 honestly I thought it might have been even
01:34:38 worse
01:34:40 but
01:34:42 yeah I went to
01:34:44 the Boston Medical
01:34:46 Center
01:34:48 did I talk about this last
01:34:50 week? I don't think so
01:34:52 okay I don't think so either
01:34:54 I think this was this week I went to Boston Medical Center
01:34:56 and I had to
01:34:58 wait in line and they told me like
01:35:00 no you got to come back
01:35:02 in like several hours you got to leave
01:35:04 and come back because we got to go to lunch
01:35:06 and like we're full up
01:35:08 it took me like half the day
01:35:10 to wait in line
01:35:12 to get COVID tested
01:35:14 because I had like my tonsils were hurting
01:35:16 and I didn't even think I had COVID I thought
01:35:18 I had strep throat
01:35:20 but when I went for a strep test
01:35:22 they made me get a COVID test too
01:35:24 and
01:35:26 I got the results of the COVID test
01:35:28 like a day later and they said no
01:35:30 COVID negative and I'm like okay cool
01:35:32 and then I got the results of the strep test
01:35:34 and they were like
01:35:36 the results were confusing
01:35:38 because it said like
01:35:40 we did detect
01:35:42 a small amount
01:35:44 of some strep bacteria
01:35:46 but the strep back
01:35:48 I looked it up and the strep bacteria is like
01:35:50 I guess the bacteria exists
01:35:52 in your mouth
01:35:54 anyway
01:35:56 so like I don't know if it
01:35:58 I genuinely don't know if the result
01:36:00 meant yes you do have
01:36:02 strep like an infection or like no you're normal
01:36:06 and I don't know what to do about it either way
01:36:08 Did they not say it was like
01:36:10 a larger than normal amount of strep bacteria?
01:36:12 It said
01:36:14 like streptococcus g-strain
01:36:16 parentheses few
01:36:18 like it had few of them
01:36:20 so I
01:36:22 guess that means I had strep throat but like
01:36:24 I feel better
01:36:26 my throat is still a little bit sore
01:36:28 but it feels mostly better
01:36:30 I've had like a little bit of a stuffy nose
01:36:32 which I don't know if strep throat is even supposed to do that
01:36:36 I don't know if maybe I caught something else
01:36:38 like a flute like a cold or something
01:36:40 or if strep just does that
01:36:42 or if maybe it's nothing
01:36:44 and I'm stupid I don't know
01:36:46 so I don't even know
01:36:48 what the point of any of that was
01:36:50 it was just a waste of time
01:36:52 and put me behind
01:36:54 on my game just like everything else
01:36:56 in life
01:36:58 that exists to do
01:37:00 what a
01:37:02 what a disaster
01:37:04 what a nightmare
01:37:06 I hate everything
01:37:08 that is not phantom's revenge
01:37:10 but I also hate phantom's revenge
01:37:12 you're so full of hate
01:37:14 I am so full of hate
01:37:16 that's why I got twitter suspended
01:37:18 you gotta remember love Ben
01:37:20 I gotta remember love
01:37:22 do you want to talk about that video
01:37:24 and how stupid it is
01:37:26 and how like annoying
01:37:28 I don't really have anything to say
01:37:30 it's just like whatever
01:37:32 all I know is what I read in your chat
01:37:34 and I haven't watched it
01:37:36 I just
01:37:38 I did listen to the video
01:37:40 my take away from it was like
01:37:42 oh my god this is like such
01:37:44 navel gazing like
01:37:46 I literally can't talk about anything but themself
01:37:48 this person is having like
01:37:50 mind blowing revelations
01:37:52 at the age of like 30
01:37:54 that like a child should understand
01:37:56 and then I look down in the comments
01:37:58 and there's like a few hundred comments that are like
01:38:00 they're all like oh my god
01:38:02 such character development
01:38:04 this is such a mature take
01:38:06 like you've grown so much like I'm so impressed
01:38:08 by like the maturity on display here
01:38:10 that's like the fact that
01:38:12 you changed your opinion in some
01:38:14 insignificant way about shit that doesn't matter
01:38:16 and doesn't even mean anything at the end of the day
01:38:18 like oh this video has me in tears
01:38:20 and it just reinforced what I already know
01:38:22 just reinforced what I already know
01:38:24 which is that like
01:38:26 Yig heads are the stupidest people
01:38:28 in the entire world
01:38:30 there's the stupidest
01:38:32 the most easily manipulated
01:38:34 most easily impressed
01:38:36 morons that exist and if you think
01:38:38 that if you like
01:38:40 if you watch it there is something wrong with you
01:38:42 in the head and I think
01:38:44 you are just like an imbecile
01:38:46 and you should seek help
01:38:48 oh it's a new fucking trick
01:38:50 tricksy video
01:38:52 it was
01:38:54 it was just sort of like
01:38:56 a bunch of
01:38:58 semi-connected
01:39:00 thoughts about something or other
01:39:02 it was hard to follow and I feel like the conclusions
01:39:04 were so
01:39:06 like normal
01:39:08 like basic that I didn't really know
01:39:10 when she was making them
01:39:12 yeah
01:39:14 yeah I genuinely couldn't tell you
01:39:16 like what like the point
01:39:18 is supposed to be
01:39:20 but boy those commenters were really
01:39:22 impressed with it
01:39:24 they really got a lot out of it
01:39:26 all of a sudden
01:39:28 I think I also
01:39:30 had enough with tricksy
01:39:32 but long before
01:39:34 she wasn't that infamous
01:39:36 podcast
01:39:38 the thing is
01:39:40 there were some guys
01:39:42 there were some guys
01:39:44 I forgot the name of the podcast
01:39:46 where she went like
01:39:48 full traitor
01:39:50 who are these podcasts
01:39:52 before that
01:39:54 I was done with her way before that
01:39:56 a couple of days before that
01:39:58 it was this thing
01:40:00 that there are some guys
01:40:02 on YouTube that are
01:40:04 creating this
01:40:06 archive
01:40:08 and they put that video
01:40:10 where Digibro
01:40:12 talked about me
01:40:14 but with my old
01:40:16 username that I want comment here
01:40:18 because I don't want to
01:40:20 and it was a rant about
01:40:22 me and it was pretty cool at the time
01:40:24 yes
01:40:26 it was
01:40:28 someone requested it
01:40:30 at the time it was very helpful but not the point
01:40:32 the point is that I changed my
01:40:34 name for several reasons
01:40:36 and one of those reasons
01:40:38 is because I've been harassed
01:40:40 on the internet
01:40:42 and it's not cool
01:40:44 so some people found
01:40:46 that video
01:40:48 the video that this archive re-uploaded
01:40:50 and they
01:40:52 for instance they found me
01:40:54 again and they started harassing me again
01:40:56 so I
01:40:58 tried for several weeks to
01:41:00 get in touch with these people
01:41:02 I got in touch with
01:41:04 other
01:41:06 Digibro archives that I didn't know
01:41:08 they even exist
01:41:10 and nobody knows
01:41:12 who owns that channel
01:41:14 so my only hope and chance was
01:41:16 to actually talk to Trixie
01:41:18 and ask her like
01:41:20 do you know these people
01:41:22 can you do something about it
01:41:24 please help me because this is
01:41:26 harassment and I want
01:41:28 to avoid I just want this video to be
01:41:30 unlisted that's all I want
01:41:32 I put a comment
01:41:34 also in the video and stuff
01:41:36 and ask Trixie for help and of course
01:41:38 she never replied so I was like
01:41:40 you know what, fuck off
01:41:42 Trixie is too good
01:41:44 Trixie is too good to answer messages
01:41:46 fuck off I was like
01:41:48 done with her
01:41:50 isn't it Tarbuk
01:41:52 isn't it Tarbuk transom that runs that channel
01:41:54 I don't know
01:41:56 there's multiple archives
01:41:58 I talked with some
01:42:00 some people
01:42:02 some other Digibro archives
01:42:04 the owners of the archives
01:42:06 and nobody seems to know that specific channel
01:42:08 who runs it
01:42:10 so I just gave up and the video is still there
01:42:12 but
01:42:14 yep
01:42:16 it sucks
01:42:18 well
01:42:20 I don't know
01:42:22 maybe it's not Tarbuk
01:42:24 I don't know
01:42:26 he was the guy who was in charge
01:42:28 he was sort of the head guy in terms of
01:42:30 collecting all the old videos
01:42:32 I don't know if he actually runs the channel though
01:42:36 what's the name of the guy
01:42:38 well
01:42:40 Tarbuk transom
01:42:42 I
01:42:44 he's in my server
01:42:46 I mean
01:42:48 he runs the
01:42:50 Digi Archive Discord
01:42:52 I talked with him
01:42:54 Tarbuk trans
01:42:56 I talked with him
01:42:58 long ago
01:43:00 he doesn't have any idea who runs that channel
01:43:02 which sucks
01:43:04 I see
01:43:06 but yeah
01:43:08 I don't know then
01:43:10 I don't know
01:43:12 just the
01:43:14 disconnect from reality
01:43:16 of like
01:43:18 people
01:43:20 who would watch that new video
01:43:22 and be like wow
01:43:24 this is so
01:43:26 important
01:43:28 I've learned something from this
01:43:30 as like Trixie
01:43:32 says like I realized recently
01:43:34 that like
01:43:36 people make easy content on youtube
01:43:38 people make low effort content on youtube
01:43:40 not because they want to make art that's bad
01:43:42 but just because
01:43:44 it's easier and it makes them more money
01:43:46 it's like wow
01:43:48 really you figured that out did you
01:43:50 that's great
01:43:52 I'm proud of you
01:43:54 it's almost so like
01:43:56 how could you not know that already
01:43:58 that I thought that was building to a different point
01:44:00 but it wasn't
01:44:02 but she does know she said it before
01:44:04 she said all that shit before
01:44:06 no Digi bro said it before
01:44:08 but Digi bro was just a character
01:44:10 she was playing
01:44:12 that was just a character you idiot
01:44:14 you fell for it
01:44:16 how could you think
01:44:18 you were a real person
01:44:20 I couldn't possibly
01:44:22 think that
01:44:24 how dare you accuse me of that
01:44:26 I would never
01:44:28 when I said that before
01:44:30 you were supposed to assume
01:44:32 that I meant the opposite
01:44:34 actually
01:44:36 okay
01:44:38 okay that's enough
01:44:40 enough
01:44:42 anything else before we go to voicemails

01:46:40 okay
01:46:42 um well we talked about that
01:46:44 a moment ago
01:46:46 post-yig
01:46:48 dog shit
01:46:50 the work of like a delusional narcissist
01:46:52 pre-yig
01:46:54 I would say it's similar like everything that has happened
01:46:56 since has made me reconsider
01:46:58 all the past videos and I now realize
01:47:00 like wait actually it's kind of always
01:47:02 been the case that Trixie like
01:47:04 doesn't understand what she's talking about
01:47:06 half the time
01:47:08 isn't like able to say anything
01:47:10 that isn't like directly about herself
01:47:12 just
01:47:14 is kind of stupid
01:47:16 and kind of always was actually
01:47:18 my favorite
01:47:20 Digi Bro content was
01:47:22 Digi Bros. the Let's Play
01:47:24 series with Victor
01:47:26 unironically
01:47:28 my favorite I had gone back and listened
01:47:30 to that a few times
01:47:32 I'm glad that child's still up
01:47:34 because Victor owns it now
01:47:36 I genuinely think that the real
01:47:38 talent like Trixie
01:47:40 thinks her talents are such
01:47:42 and such but her actual talent
01:47:44 was always only ever
01:47:46 to like make
01:47:48 to make like losers and like weirdos
01:47:50 like think that she is like
01:47:52 them
01:47:54 that's what did it for her
01:47:56 more than like
01:47:58 her ability to like
01:48:00 make compelling points or like
01:48:02 articulate something
01:48:04 something
01:48:06 impactful or whatever
01:48:08 it's like the
01:48:10 I don't know
01:48:12 just terrible
01:48:14 there's like nuggets of good video
01:48:16 scattered around but I couldn't remember
01:48:18 yeah sure
01:48:20 which ones? I remember the good ones
01:48:22 do you remember Love?
01:48:24 do you remember Love? oh no I don't remember that
01:48:26 you forgot Love?
01:48:28 what is it?
01:48:30 where's Urban Dictionary?
01:48:32 I don't know
01:48:34 we don't have Nate to help us
01:48:36 you don't have Nate to look it up
01:48:38 on Urban Dictionary
01:48:40 Nate's always a hero with the link
01:48:42 remember Nate?
01:48:44 I don't
01:48:46 we have forgotten Nate
01:48:48 we have forgotten
01:48:50 we have forgotten Nate
01:48:52 the next
01:48:54 question is another text question
01:48:56 it's not the audio
01:48:58 the PCP Corner Guy
01:49:00 we rebranded
01:49:02 the PCP died and we rebranded it
01:49:04 and now we do Tombstones
01:49:06 and that's what happened to the PCP Corner Guy
01:49:08 I guess he's probably also dead
01:49:10 he's also probably buried somewhere
01:49:12 he died again
01:49:14 I guess he died
01:49:16 I guess he's dead
01:49:18 that's the canon answer
01:49:20 okay next one and this is the audio
01:49:22 one is called Do It
01:49:24 so let's give this a listen
01:49:26 go
01:49:28 I was thinking the exact same thing this week
01:49:30 I was looking at the logo it's like why don't we just change it to be PCP
01:49:32 it's stupid
01:49:34 nobody calls it TPC
01:49:36 that's true
01:49:38 it's hard
01:49:40 it's hard
01:49:42 it would take me like an hour
01:49:44 it would take me like an hour to change the logo
01:49:46 no you're wrong
01:49:48 you're an idiot
01:49:50 because I would have to find the font
01:49:52 and I don't know what font it is
01:49:54 I would have to recreate it by hand
01:49:56 which would be annoying
01:49:58 just copy the P
01:50:00 just copy the P
01:50:02 do different font, different CD
01:50:04 I guess I could kind of just copy the P
01:50:06 and that would take most of the work out of it
01:50:08 yeah I guess I could just do that
01:50:10 no but like because
01:50:12 there's no high res
01:50:14 okay I would have to find the high res version
01:50:16 of it I think there is one in the
01:50:18 Google Drive
01:50:20 the high res version has like the
01:50:22 just cut off
01:50:24 it's always been an annoyance
01:50:26 you just give me $15 to vector it
01:50:28 and then you'll have infinite resolution
01:50:30 no
01:50:32 they'll never get my $15
01:50:36 you're gonna give me $15 when you make more
01:50:38 than me on Patreon
01:50:40 oh shit
01:50:42 that'll be $15 over 15 months Ben
01:50:46 okay well I'll take what I can get
01:50:48 I guess
01:50:50 okay next voicemail is called
01:50:56 it's called why do boomers
01:50:58 and there it is
01:51:00 okay why do boomers
01:51:02 3, 2, 1, go
01:51:04 why are boomers
01:51:06 so obsessed with gas prices to determine
01:51:08 whether or not a politician is good
01:51:10 because boomers love cars
01:51:12 and
01:51:14 they're self centered
01:51:16 I understood
01:51:18 boomers are the real
01:51:20 it's just a very obvious
01:51:22 I listened to gas and I was really confused
01:51:26 what
01:51:28 do you not call it gas
01:51:30 it was cars or gas
01:51:34 there's petrol and gasoline
01:51:36 which I think are exactly the same thing
01:51:38 oh yeah yeah nice
01:51:40 gas
01:51:42 my parents were always like
01:51:44 gas prices are just a very obvious
01:51:46 it actually fluctuates
01:51:48 and you can see it very clearly
01:51:50 every day when you drive
01:51:52 so it's just really in your face
01:51:54 oh gas prices are up
01:51:56 I notice that all the time
01:51:58 so I guess politics are bad now
01:52:00 because the gas is more expensive
01:52:02 it's just a very obvious
01:52:04 it's just a very obvious thing
01:52:06 it's a very obvious indicator of something
01:52:08 god damn gas prices are so high
01:52:10 we need to go bomb some more middle eastern countries
01:52:12 to get that cheap gas
01:52:14 I guess so
01:52:16 although
01:52:18 although we don't actually
01:52:20 import that much gas
01:52:22 we get it from oil rigs
01:52:24 or whatever
01:52:26 well maybe the UK is different
01:52:28 but in America we mostly
01:52:30 create our
01:52:32 oil domestically
01:52:34 the thing about gas
01:52:36 from Saudi Arabia and the Middle East
01:52:38 is mostly about maintaining
01:52:40 control in the region
01:52:42 controlling the supply to our enemies
01:52:44 like Russia and stuff
01:52:46 it's not about acquiring the oil
01:52:48 for ourselves so much
01:52:50 if you control the
01:52:52 oil's patreon page
01:52:54 then you get to
01:52:56 cut a bit off the top
01:52:58 every time there's a transaction
01:53:00 if you make more oil
01:53:02 than your enemy
01:53:04 then you have to give them oil
01:53:06 on patreon
01:53:08 imagine if Russia had a patreon page
01:53:10 I'll donate one drop
01:53:12 I'll pledge one drop of oil per month
01:53:14 imagine that
01:53:16 countries having patreons and then if you pledge
01:53:18 a certain amount you get citizenship
01:53:22 if you pledge a certain amount
01:53:24 you'll be Putin's best friend
01:53:26 I get called to give you a zoom call
01:53:30 every few months I get a call from
01:53:32 some fucking police fundraiser
01:53:34 or another
01:53:36 yesterday I got a call from something called
01:53:38 the Trollmans fund
01:53:40 which I'm sure is a police thing
01:53:42 and I always hang up on them
01:53:46 I think it might be the same guy
01:53:48 under a bunch of different aliases
01:53:50 maybe they just all sound the same
01:53:54 next the voicemail
01:53:56 is called
01:53:58 sorry for sending two voicemails
01:54:00 in a row

01:54:30 that much in like

01:55:12 so
01:55:14 I don't agree
01:55:16 when I say so
01:55:18 and maybe some things are
01:55:20 that simple
01:55:22 yeah get organized
01:55:24 clean your room it's good for you
01:55:26 I guess

01:55:32 my room is like too big
01:55:34 my room is like a little bit too big
01:55:36 and I don't have like enough furniture
01:55:38 to fill it with
01:55:40 so one corner of my room is just a pile
01:55:42 of boxes just because something's got to take
01:55:44 up that space
01:55:46 I don't know fuck it
01:55:48 next voicemail is called

01:56:20 no no no okay okay
01:56:22 seething okay
01:56:24 coping and seething and molding
01:56:26 are not the same thing as hating
01:56:28 being a hater
01:56:30 is being like a naysayer
01:56:32 like a party
01:56:34 like being like oh

01:56:38 that thing sucks
01:56:40 that thing's stupid

01:57:04 and I proudly hate on those things
01:57:06 um and that's my
01:57:08 official I think it is

01:57:54 this is stealing
01:57:56 there are two clips this is clip one
01:57:58 three two one
01:58:00 go
01:58:02 and you know ben ben is my
01:58:04 literal biological brother we grew up together
01:58:06 we got a lot of memories together and
01:58:08 I mean hey what can I say I love my brother
01:58:10 I love my brother
01:58:12 I love him he's a good guy
01:58:14 uh I got his back
01:58:16 and uh he's clearly got my back
01:58:18 sometimes
01:58:20 uh
01:58:22 that's sweet that's sweet
01:58:24 I'm glad he thinks so
01:58:26 because I think that's generally true
01:58:28 I won't you know
01:58:30 I won't I won't uh
01:58:32 you know
01:58:34 you know did you see the thing the thing in the news about like
01:58:36 Chris Cuomo
01:58:38 getting uh
01:58:40 fired from NBC or whatever
01:58:42 you know what I'm talking about nope
01:58:44 okay
01:58:46 well oh sum up
01:58:48 the governor shit I think
01:58:50 I think he was the governor of New York
01:58:52 or he might have been the mayor of New York City
01:58:54 I always confuse those two
01:58:56 but one of those two was this guy Andrew Cuomo
01:58:58 and he was
01:59:00 really popular for a minute there during
01:59:02 covid the libs were
01:59:04 really loving Andrew Cuomo
01:59:06 but then like he did a bunch of
01:59:08 shit he like lied about a bunch of figures he like
01:59:10 got a lot of people killed
01:59:12 due to like fucking around behind
01:59:14 the scenes with with like the data
01:59:16 and stuff he acted on bad data
01:59:18 he he obscured figures to
01:59:20 make himself look better make the state
01:59:22 look better a lot of people
01:59:24 died uh but that
01:59:26 was fine nobody cared about that but then
01:59:28 there was like a sexual harassment scandal
01:59:30 because he like made he like
01:59:32 made women feel uncomfortable and like
01:59:34 was behaving inappropriately
01:59:36 and that was a big
01:59:38 thing that caused a big scandal and I think
01:59:40 got him like impeached or something
01:59:42 and his brother Chris Cuomo
01:59:44 is like
01:59:46 one of the head like anchors
01:59:48 for a major news network I think it's NBC
01:59:50 I forget
01:59:52 but apparently Chris Cuomo
01:59:54 was basically
01:59:56 like
01:59:58 giving Andrew like privileged information
02:00:00 he was he was basically colluding
02:00:02 with Andrew to like
02:00:04 help him get off these charges of like
02:00:06 sexual harassment which is obviously
02:00:08 inappropriate behavior
02:00:10 for you know a national
02:00:12 news anchor and the governor
02:00:14 of like a state or mayor
02:00:16 of a major city or whatever
02:00:18 so in this
02:00:20 shit came out and they they they fired
02:00:22 Chris Cuomo over it
02:00:24 and a bunch of other
02:00:26 journals were like if my brother
02:00:28 did something illegal
02:00:30 you know I'd have his back right
02:00:32 like I'd have my brother's back
02:00:34 no matter what and it's like you know that's
02:00:36 that's nepotism that's collusion that's
02:00:38 illegal you're literally just admitting to being
02:00:40 corrupt is what you're saying there
02:00:42 so
02:00:44 so I wouldn't have Nate's I wouldn't have
02:00:46 Nate's back if he did anything like Andrew
02:00:48 Cuomo I wouldn't
02:00:50 I wouldn't say it's not
02:00:52 it's not an unconditional back having right
02:00:54 there are things you could do that I
02:00:56 would be like I can't have your back about this
02:00:58 definitely but in general it's true I
02:01:00 yeah but in general it's true
02:01:02 I do have Nate's back and I'm glad
02:01:04 that he knows that
02:01:06 that reminds me of my brother
02:01:08 who
02:01:10 I mentioned this a few years ago also was
02:01:12 involved in a sexual harassment
02:01:14 not sexual harassment he was being sued by Sony
02:01:16 because
02:01:18 I guess I could tell this quickly this is a
02:01:20 fucking crazy thing that happened a few years ago
02:01:22 my younger
02:01:24 brother wanted access to
02:01:26 the PlayStation 4
02:01:28 like development kit or something
02:01:30 it's like some proprietary
02:01:32 software but you have to
02:01:34 that game companies can license to make
02:01:36 PlayStation 4 games or maybe it was PSP or something
02:01:38 but
02:01:40 he was just a guy he didn't have access to
02:01:42 it and he wanted it so he
02:01:44 and my little brother is
02:01:46 autistic and he's like not very good at
02:01:48 like
02:01:50 communicating I guess
02:01:52 but somehow he managed to create
02:01:54 a fake how old is he
02:01:56 he was like 16 17 or something
02:01:58 he managed
02:02:00 to create a fake identity
02:02:02 and a fake company and get it officially
02:02:04 registered with the New Zealand government
02:02:06 and a fake location
02:02:08 like if you look
02:02:10 it up if you look up the coordinates
02:02:12 on the map it's just an empty field where he
02:02:14 claimed his his game companies office
02:02:16 was he got the company officially registered
02:02:18 so that he could like
02:02:20 you know go to go to Sony
02:02:22 and ask for the PlayStation 4 like
02:02:24 dev kit
02:02:26 and they gave it to him
02:02:28 and then he just leaked it
02:02:30 and
02:02:32 they caught him immediately
02:02:34 that sounds like something you could sue over
02:02:36 it's very dangerous for him
02:02:38 they caught him immediately because
02:02:40 when they give the kit to someone they like
02:02:42 they embed your information in there so that they can
02:02:44 track it and they caught him
02:02:46 immediately because he was too young
02:02:48 they tried to sue my whole family and I'm like
02:02:50 oh my god
02:02:52 I don't have your back but also my family
02:02:54 can't afford to deal with this so
02:02:56 I hope
02:02:58 I can't defend him
02:03:00 but
02:03:02 I'm glad it ended up getting resolved
02:03:04 without
02:03:06 a whole bunch of money being lost
02:03:08 for my family
02:03:10 so I mean wait
02:03:12 did that
02:03:14 resolve itself? it did get resolved
02:03:16 again my mom's a lawyer
02:03:18 which helps so
02:03:20 she was able to be like look
02:03:22 he's a minor like they were trying to argue
02:03:24 that like he's narrowed
02:03:26 literally narrowed a virgin and a minor
02:03:28 he's a neurodivergent minor who
02:03:30 they were trying to argue well
02:03:32 it's clearly negligence the parents
02:03:34 you should have known this was going on
02:03:36 for me knowing what my brother's like
02:03:38 he's like a little
02:03:40 little goblin troll in his room
02:03:42 he doesn't like communicate much
02:03:44 it's very hard to know what he's getting up to
02:03:46 of course and if you try to
02:03:48 peak your nose on his business
02:03:50 he gets very agitated
02:03:52 and lashes out so it's
02:03:54 not smart to like do that
02:03:56 you have to give him space
02:03:58 so they were able to get it settled
02:04:00 on those grounds but sony really wanted to
02:04:02 sue my family over that
02:04:04 jesus that's kind of scary
02:04:06 wait one sec I need another
02:04:08 I need another sparkling water
02:04:10 I've got the small bottles they don't last
02:04:12 they don't last long enough
02:04:14 oh jesus oh god it's gone
02:04:16 everywhere
02:04:20 I'm gonna pee
02:04:22 okay
02:04:24 okay I'm back just kidding
02:04:26 didn't go everywhere
02:04:28 ah fuck although it might
02:04:30 it fell out of the
02:04:32 I just remembered another thing
02:04:34 it fell out of the fridge so it might go ever when I open it
02:04:36 let's
02:04:38 no no it's fine okay few
02:04:40 anyway what did you remember
02:04:42 what's up I just remembered
02:04:44 the other time
02:04:46 my mom sued the New Zealand government
02:04:48 and won
02:04:50 I'm just remembering all these things
02:04:54 well what
02:04:56 well in 2008
02:04:58 my mom was
02:05:00 the PA
02:05:02 for sanitarium the New Zealand branch
02:05:04 of sanitarium which is like a big health food company
02:05:08 anyone living in Australia or New Zealand will be
02:05:10 familiar with them they make up and go
02:05:12 that's like a very unappetizing name
02:05:14 for a food company
02:05:16 well the word sanitarium is
02:05:18 unappetizing to me because
02:05:20 that's all I knew them for
02:05:22 I didn't know what that word had another meaning
02:05:24 well in any case my mom was in a car accident
02:05:26 she was just parked
02:05:28 and another car slammed into her
02:05:30 and like it fucked up her neck really badly
02:05:32 and she lost her job
02:05:34 and so she had to go on like a you know
02:05:36 I thought you were gonna say she lost her jaw
02:05:38 like she was like
02:05:40 like Roger Ebert like no jaw
02:05:42 okay
02:05:44 no she got a slip of disc in her neck
02:05:46 she had to go on like a disability
02:05:48 that's awful
02:05:50 she had to go on a disability for people
02:05:52 who've been in accidents
02:05:54 and it never like properly healed
02:05:56 she was just an awful pain
02:05:58 for like 5, 6, 7 years
02:06:00 like the pain still hasn't gone away
02:06:02 since 2008 it's never completely gone
02:06:04 and for the first like 3 years
02:06:06 she was like
02:06:08 on so many like pain killers
02:06:10 that like you're not supposed to take them
02:06:12 for like long periods of time
02:06:14 to like be taken at that dosage
02:06:16 for a lot so
02:06:18 like the pain killers were building up in the system
02:06:20 and like fucking up things even more
02:06:22 she had a surgery that didn't work out
02:06:24 and like 3 years into this
02:06:26 she has an appointment with her
02:06:28 I think it's called ACC
02:06:30 is like the government
02:06:32 organization that handles like this benefit
02:06:34 she had an appointment
02:06:36 you know one of her regularly scheduled appointments
02:06:38 with the doctor to see how she was doing
02:06:40 and they just
02:06:42 were like oh hey this appointment
02:06:44 we're going to see a different doctor
02:06:46 not your usual one
02:06:48 we're sending you our special doctor
02:06:50 and it has to be on this date and if you don't show up on this date
02:06:52 at this time you're losing your benefit
02:06:54 and they'd never been that stringent before
02:06:56 it was like whoa what the fuck
02:06:58 so she goes into this new
02:07:00 office with a new guy
02:07:02 the second she walks in the guy's like
02:07:04 oh hey we're here to talk about your degenerative condition
02:07:06 which is translation for
02:07:08 what?
02:07:10 I mean that's not the car accident
02:07:12 you're just old
02:07:14 my mom was like early 30's
02:07:16 at this point
02:07:18 and so
02:07:20 they tried to like his point
02:07:22 without even looking at the scans
02:07:24 he didn't look at anything
02:07:26 he was just like a government appointed doctor
02:07:28 who just said oh yeah you're getting old
02:07:30 and the car accident had nothing to do with it
02:07:32 and I haven't looked at your records
02:07:34 I'm just saying this you're off the benefit
02:07:36 basically just lying
02:07:38 like this is his job
02:07:40 is to just like come up with bullshit reasons
02:07:42 to kick people off the benefit
02:07:44 and he's done this to a whole bunch of people
02:07:46 who've like sued him in the past
02:07:48 and it is bullshit
02:07:50 and my mom
02:07:52 sounds like a racket
02:07:54 so my mom sued him and the government over it
02:07:56 and eventually won
02:07:58 but because all of the
02:08:00 it took years for the lawsuit to like
02:08:02 actually go through by the time it actually
02:08:04 like succeeded
02:08:06 so she gave her like all three years
02:08:08 worth of overdue payments at once
02:08:10 and for that year
02:08:12 it pushed her over a certain income bracket
02:08:14 and like most of it got taxed away anyway
02:08:16 so
02:08:18 fucking hell
02:08:20 no come on
02:08:22 but like progressive income brackets though
02:08:24 like can't
02:08:26 I feel like in a situation like this
02:08:28 when it's money of a government owes you
02:08:30 like maybe that should like be exempt
02:08:32 shouldn't be taxable
02:08:34 for like someone who has a disability
02:08:36 I
02:08:38 I was on
02:08:40 I was on pandemic unemployment
02:08:42 benefits
02:08:44 for last year and some of this year
02:08:46 and I was a bit dismayed
02:08:48 and confused to learn that like
02:08:50 yeah that's taxable like you have to pay taxes
02:08:52 on that for some reason
02:08:54 like okay
02:08:56 well
02:08:58 why don't you just give me less then
02:09:00 if you're just gonna tax me for it but okay whatever
02:09:02 guys whatever you want to do
02:09:04 yeah
02:09:06 oh well yeah I see
02:09:08 well
02:09:10 slipped slip disc in the neck sounds pretty fucking bad
02:09:12 yeah I live in fear of a slip
02:09:14 disc anywhere I mean
02:09:16 and the neck sounds like basically the worst place
02:09:18 you can get it
02:09:20 I would imagine that probably the lower
02:09:22 on the spine it is the less
02:09:24 bad it is
02:09:26 I had a slipped disc in my playstation
02:09:28 it was awful
02:09:30 yeah
02:09:32 you gotta grip it
02:09:34 you gotta put the pad on
02:09:36 or something
02:09:38 you gotta clean that disc
02:09:40 okay so the next voicemail
02:09:42 is BGE Monthly Cast Clip 2
02:09:44 and how much do you want to bet that
02:09:46 this one just like is the exact opposite
02:09:48 it's like
02:09:50 after the last one it's like but
02:09:52 he sucks and I hate Ben
02:09:54 actually how much do you want to bet
02:09:56 that it's like cancelling out the first one
02:09:58 I don't know
02:10:00 alright well let's see
02:10:02 oh maybe
02:10:04 I just feel like
02:10:06 the fact that this voicemailer left
02:10:08 two voicemails
02:10:10 makes me think that probably one is
02:10:12 like a direct response to the other
02:10:14 but I don't know we'll see
02:10:16 3
02:10:18 there it is
02:10:20 3, 2, 1, go
02:10:22 I'm a dictator
02:10:24 I literally do things for the greater good
02:10:26 I kill a couple people
02:10:28 who would have undermined my regime
02:10:30 for the greater good and everyone's ultimately happy
02:10:32 but also I raped a bitch
02:10:34 I felt like raping this girl this one time
02:10:36 is that fine
02:10:38 is that fine
02:10:40 I'm sorry what did I say
02:10:42 I said I couldn't defend you if you pulled some Cuomo shit
02:10:44 frankly
02:10:46 this is beyond Cuomo level
02:10:48 I'm sorry Nate
02:10:50 you're on your own
02:10:52 I can't have your back
02:10:54 the voicemailer knew what our conversation would be
02:10:56 they predicted everything
02:11:00 damn I can't believe Nate really
02:11:02 I can't believe he really is
02:11:04 doing all that stuff
02:11:06 I can't believe that
02:11:08 Nate said that
02:11:10 and since Nate isn't part of the mainstream
02:11:12 media I have to take everything he says
02:11:14 exactly at face value
02:11:18 tragic Terran family's
02:11:20 apart
02:11:22 okay
02:11:24 next
02:11:26 okay there was a comment
02:11:28 and I left a mean response to this comment
02:11:30 I was very mean to this guy
02:11:32 but I feel like it was warranted
02:11:34 there was a comment that was like
02:11:36 on the last episode they said
02:11:38 you guys have to stop with the unironic Nate hate
02:11:40 pretending like he's a literal monster
02:11:42 yeah I saw that as well
02:11:44 I don't even remember what
02:11:46 I don't remember what we said
02:11:48 I don't remember what we said that was that bad
02:11:50 I think maybe we
02:11:52 made fun of him for
02:11:54 not making enough videos or something
02:11:56 or something about being
02:11:58 like disappointed about the
02:12:00 podcast ending
02:12:02 I don't know
02:12:04 I felt like he was taking whatever it was was too serious
02:12:06 it's not that serious
02:12:08 anyway
02:12:10 next voicemail
02:12:12 next voicemail is
02:12:16 it's called once again on my pokemon
02:12:18 pokemon bullshit
02:12:20 3, 2, 1, go
02:12:22 hey y'all

02:12:26 I'm making a pokemon rom hack
02:12:28 and I'd love to include you guys
02:12:30 in the background
02:12:32 or whatever
02:12:34 so could you just tell me some of the like
02:12:36 pokemon that must be on your team

02:12:58 hatterine
02:13:00 she has big boobs
02:13:02 it's canon
02:13:04 oh hatterine is good
02:13:06 I have two like
02:13:08 pseudo canon teams
02:13:10 I have my team in the minecraft server
02:13:12 which is
02:13:14 swine, vulcarona
02:13:16 crowbat
02:13:18 I'm forgetting
02:13:20 yes yes
02:13:22 and he's poisoned
02:13:24 just like
02:13:26 the vaccines
02:13:30 he's 5G
02:13:32 he's 5G
02:13:36 oh fuck what else
02:13:38 I'm drawing a blank
02:13:40 I'm so stupid
02:13:42 whatever go watch the streams
02:13:44 okay and then there's my cop killer
02:13:46 my cop killer team
02:13:48 which is what I used in the rfck battle against
02:13:50 the rowdy fucker
02:13:52 and also what is in my NPC
02:13:54 cop killer version which is also in the server
02:13:56 that one had another team
02:13:58 and that one
02:14:00 I think crowbat was on there was definitely a corvanite
02:14:02 I really like corvanite
02:14:04 a bulk up corvanite is one of my favorite
02:14:06 mons
02:14:08 so that one's pretty good
02:14:10 mammoth swine, corvanite
02:14:12 I don't know
02:14:14 just do whatever you think is good
02:14:20 pokemon that I would have
02:14:22 are like
02:14:24 usually cute
02:14:26 and or edgy
02:14:28 I don't have any specifics
02:14:30 except maybe duskull
02:14:32 I love duskull
02:14:34 which is the cute
02:14:36 spooky one
02:14:38 and I like water pokemon
02:14:40 and
02:14:44 sometimes a big pokemon
02:14:46 I don't know there's lots of pokemon that are good
02:14:48 I could think of many like teams
02:14:54 I mostly like edgy pokemon
02:14:56 but I really really like
02:14:58 ulteria and mega ulteria
02:15:00 that's like one of my favorites
02:15:02 it's not edgy
02:15:04 it's just epic
02:15:06 it's like
02:15:08 epic wistful
02:15:10 different type
02:15:12 epic wistful
02:15:14 I remember using a combo
02:15:16 that I don't remember now
02:15:18 but it was between ombreon
02:15:20 and gardavor
02:15:22 it was mega gardavor probably
02:15:24 gardavor, gardavor
02:15:26 but I really like
02:15:28 I really like ombreon
02:15:30 and shackle, shackle is awesome
02:15:32 there should be a goregeist
02:15:34 as well because that's punk
02:15:36 that's a pumpkin
02:15:38 yeah, true
02:15:42 you can't have a shackle
02:15:44 and an ombreon on the same team
02:15:46 you don't need tools
02:15:48 I just like shackle
02:15:50 shackle in general
02:15:52 it's my favorite
02:15:56 there's plenty of pokemon
02:15:58 that I really like but you can't use
02:16:00 there's a poke
02:16:02 shackle is like he's kind of good
02:16:04 but he's kind of mostly bad
02:16:06 but it's really funny to actually win
02:16:08 a battle with shackle
02:16:10 yeah
02:16:12 oh wait, wait, wait
02:16:14 I've got like three, no four
02:16:16 so duskull, sharpido
02:16:18 goregeist and spheal
02:16:20 those are four
02:16:22 I'm not sure about the other two
02:16:24 so cool
02:16:26 yeah, he's edgy
02:16:28 but he's also kind of a ball
02:16:30 I like spherical pokemon
02:16:36 he is so short
02:16:38 sharpido is such a little stump
02:16:40 there is a pokemon that is a punk
02:16:44 that's goregeist
02:16:46 except her like pumpkin
02:16:48 is her thick belly
02:16:50 pumpkaboo and goregeist
02:16:52 that's the line
02:16:54 that's the unevolved form of goregeist
02:16:56 oh
02:16:58 yeah
02:17:00 I see it
02:17:02 I have not played the gen that goregeist is from
02:17:04 I've just seen her and I'm like oh yeah
02:17:06 is he from gen
02:17:08 five
02:17:10 six
02:17:12 I think it might be gen six
02:17:14 I also used a lot of mimikyu
02:17:16 back then
02:17:18 mimikyu is really cool
02:17:20 mimikyu is good
02:17:22 oh shit, wait, there's another one
02:17:24 what's the sun and moon pokemon
02:17:26 lilligant
02:17:28 lilligant
02:17:30 has the big
02:17:32 wait, no, lilligant is older than that
02:17:34 oh, okay, well whatever
02:17:36 no, no, no, I'm thinking of bolossum
02:17:38 it's not bolossum
02:17:40 lilligant has the big poofy legs
02:17:42 which I really like
02:17:46 was lilligant new in sun and moon?
02:17:48 that's where I first saw her
02:17:50 I played gen three and then skipped straight to sun and moon
02:17:52 I don't know anything in between
02:17:54 how's that plan
02:17:56 pokemon
02:17:58 with huge legs
02:18:00 yeah, with a dress
02:18:02 no, I think you're thinking of
02:18:04 sarena
02:18:06 sarena is like the purple one
02:18:08 that looks like a
02:18:10 you know what
02:18:12 I have a from
02:18:14 gen four on awards
02:18:16 I have this problem that I
02:18:18 begin watching the anime
02:18:20 Japanese
02:18:22 so I have this mix of
02:18:24 American names and Japanese
02:18:26 names of pokemon
02:18:28 it's really, really confusing
02:18:30 starting from gen four
02:18:32 it's like Jesus Christ
02:18:34 I usually name like
02:18:36 I'm not familiar with the Japanese name sadly
02:18:38 it's really confusing, I hate it
02:18:40 I'm trying to think what
02:18:42 mangosteen
02:18:44 the fruit that sarena
02:18:46 line is based on is a mangosteen
02:18:48 I just thought of
02:18:50 like a variant of muck
02:18:52 that was like made of magma
02:18:54 but that doesn't exist
02:18:56 it's actually a dark cloud enemy
02:18:58 oh, I remember that
02:19:02 it was on a draw cast
02:19:04 where we did pokemon
02:19:06 combos
02:19:08 no, pokemon of different typing
02:19:10 this is supposed to be lilligant but fighting type
02:19:12 no, it's specifically
02:19:14 fighting ground
02:19:16 every second she is fighting the ground
02:19:18 it's awesome
02:19:20 it's unsettling
02:19:22 I can't believe I'm looking at it
02:19:24 again
02:19:28 wow, well thank you for
02:19:30 sharing that
02:19:32 it's incredible
02:19:34 the next
02:19:36 the next voicemail
02:19:38 is called

02:20:04 that I put in the title
02:20:06 this is a game called Undertale 2
02:20:08 and it looks like it's just going to be
02:20:10 a little meme, like a dumb little meme game
02:20:12 but if you try it out
02:20:14 you'll honestly be shocked by how good it is
02:20:16 I was
02:20:18 if you like stuff like Undertale
02:20:20 obviously, The Simpsons
02:20:22 Toho, Tails gets trolled
02:20:24 weird RPG maker games
02:20:26 like Hilux and Space Funeral
02:20:28 and fishing minigames
02:20:30 you'll love this game
02:20:32 I could go on and on
02:20:34 about what I like about it but
02:20:36 just give that page a look, see if you like it
02:20:38 try it out, you won't be disappointed
02:20:40 from
02:20:42 I was already going to recommend this
02:20:44 but it became even more relevant
02:20:46 when you talked about
02:20:48 your concerns for the copyrighted material
02:20:50 in your own game
02:20:52 this game has way more copyright infringement
02:20:54 than you could ever hope to achieve
02:20:56 so I don't think you need to worry about that
02:20:58 yeah but it's on itch though
02:21:00 this guy makes other games, they're all on itch
02:21:02 it's not a problem
02:21:04 so yeah, people at home
02:21:06 Google Undertale 2, Revenge of the Robots
02:21:08 it's the first link
02:21:10 you gotta try it
02:21:12 this does look awesome
02:21:14 not to mention the artwork is
02:21:16 extremely epic with a hint of gay
02:21:18 I love it
02:21:20 this does look awesome
02:21:22 this does look awesome
02:21:24 yeah
02:21:26 this is on itch
02:21:28 where I was not worried about
02:21:30 copyright stuff being a problem
02:21:32 on itch, I was worried about it being a problem
02:21:34 on Steam, which it probably
02:21:36 still would be
02:21:38 but
02:21:40 yeah
02:21:42 I will probably
02:21:44 play this, this looks
02:21:46 really good actually
02:21:50 you guys see him this shit
02:21:52 I'm looking at it
02:21:54 you guys see him this shit
02:21:56 I went to the page and the animations
02:21:58 maybe we should checkles for hackles
02:22:00 maybe we could do that
02:22:02 maybe we could checkles for hackles
02:22:04 Kazy's been telling me
02:22:06 to play Undertale 2
02:22:08 the other one
02:22:10 Delta Rune 2
02:22:12 for a chapter 2
02:22:14 and I keep saying yeah I'll do it
02:22:16 maybe I want to do this instead
02:22:22 yeah say it's Delta Rune 2
02:22:24 and just put this up
02:22:26 Delta Rune 2
02:22:28 is old news
02:22:30 Undertale 2 is the new
02:22:32 Delta Rune is the new hotness
02:22:36 whatever
02:22:38 okay next
02:22:40 voicemail
02:22:42 is
02:22:44 shit
02:22:46 here this is the link and it is called
02:22:50 it's called Penny Packer
02:22:52 3 2 1
02:22:54 go
02:22:56 hey I sent a voicemail
02:22:58 last time and I misgendered Hippo
02:23:00 since I haven't listened to the podcast
02:23:02 in years I forgot about his metamorphosis
02:23:04 you did it again
02:23:06 you fucking bitch
02:23:08 I also maintained that Ben is pretty gay
02:23:10 but you know at least
02:23:12 he's not as cringe as Nate is these days
02:23:14 who desperately tries to sound smart
02:23:16 but he just comes off as a doofus instead
02:23:18 but you know
02:23:20 at least Hippo deserves to be called a she
02:23:22 she's trying at least
02:23:24 okay if we're talking about whatever
02:23:26 a bitch did you fell into
02:23:28 or whatever gay shit he calls himself these days
02:23:30 bro no fuck off
02:23:32 I know it's just crazy
02:23:34 and I don't want to respect his pronoun
02:23:36 since he's just addicted to Adderall at least dick
02:23:38 no fuck you
02:23:40 his gang is pretty cringe as well
02:23:42 yeah that's about it
02:23:44 the gang is cringe but this voicemail is very cringe
02:23:46 alright I don't remember
02:23:48 when they misgendered me in another voicemail
02:23:50 but fuck you
02:23:52 that's not how
02:23:54 that's not how trans works
02:23:56 you don't get to decide
02:23:58 when and if
02:24:00 you want to respect a person's identity
02:24:02 I think
02:24:04 that trans people
02:24:06 are valid but I don't think
02:24:08 chris chan counts because
02:24:10 chris doesn't
02:24:12 wear makeup
02:24:14 and also did a crime
02:24:16 and that means that
02:24:18 they're a boy now
02:24:20 oh
02:24:22 shut the fuck up
02:24:24 that was irritating
02:24:26 such a terrible voicemail
02:24:28 I would think you would know better
02:24:30 I would think you would know better
02:24:32 I've said
02:24:34 I've explained why this is wrong
02:24:36 I would
02:24:38 oh no just the ones I like
02:24:40 just the ones that I like
02:24:42 just the ones that I like count
02:24:44 if I don't like you it doesn't count
02:24:46 you're one of the good ones
02:24:48 I'd rather you just not be bigoted
02:24:50 actually it'll be better
02:24:52 guys from the voicemails you have the option
02:24:54 to shut up
02:24:56 don't say anything but you
02:24:58 fucking morons
02:25:00 what the hell was that
02:25:02 what the hell was that
02:25:04 I'm going to kiss my trans husband
02:25:06 on the cheek just to spite you
02:25:08 also the go fund me is still going on
02:25:10 I'm gonna link that
02:25:12 the annoying thing is that I feel like
02:25:14 they think of themselves as
02:25:16 like trans accepting
02:25:18 but clearly they don't
02:25:20 they're not really
02:25:22 thinking about it correctly
02:25:24 that is the annoying part
02:25:26 it's the
02:25:28 the idea that
02:25:30 respecting a trans person
02:25:32 means just coddling them
02:25:34 or like giving them
02:25:36 if they're trying hard
02:25:38 then you throw them a bone
02:25:40 and you gender them correctly
02:25:42 but other than that
02:25:44 they don't really like
02:25:46 like it's
02:25:48 it speaks to like
02:25:50 a general
02:25:52 like not
02:25:54 what's the way to phrase it
02:25:56 not agreeing with the terms
02:25:58 but just doing it because it's a nice thing
02:26:00 to do not because it's like correct
02:26:04 the implicit assumption
02:26:06 the implicit assumption there is that
02:26:08 the implicit assumption there
02:26:10 is that you
02:26:12 the other person
02:26:14 you get to choose
02:26:16 you get to pick it for another person
02:26:18 and oh if you
02:26:20 and if someone like
02:26:22 if they please you
02:26:24 if you decide okay this person is cool
02:26:26 I'll do them the favor
02:26:28 I'll do them the favor
02:26:30 I'll respect their pronouns
02:26:32 because I like them
02:26:34 but if I don't like them for whatever reason
02:26:36 obviously then I'm not gonna do it
02:26:38 they don't deserve it
02:26:40 they don't deserve to get that from me
02:26:42 because I
02:26:44 am the chooser
02:26:46 I get to decide if they deserve it or not
02:26:48 and I'm gonna choose not to give it to them
02:26:50 because they haven't earned it
02:26:52 you gotta work for it, you gotta earn it
02:26:54 it's terrible, it's awful
02:26:56 it makes me really mad
02:26:58 fuck you
02:27:00 fuck you penny packer
02:27:02 get fucked
02:27:04 next voicemail
02:27:06 is called
02:27:08 my accidental meeting with ben saint
02:27:10 at mice
02:27:12 uh

02:28:52 uh the
02:28:54 no, you should know from last
02:28:56 episode that I converted all my bitcoin
02:28:58 to ethereum so that I can pay the gas prices
02:29:00 to get my usdt and usdc out
02:29:02 duh
02:29:04 but what about your usdc
02:29:06 no, you don't gotta check
02:29:08 wait, I gotta check gas prices

02:29:16 wait, okay, ethereum average gas price

02:29:20 oh, we're down, we're down to only 78
02:29:22 hey, that's the lowest it's been
02:29:24 since october
02:29:26 that usdt is
02:29:28 ah, it's gonna be so good
02:29:30 wait, okay, we gotta check the price of bitcoin
02:29:32 no
02:29:34 we gotta check the price of bitcoin
02:29:36 nah, shut up, nah, we do
02:29:38 the people expected
02:29:40 they come to us for financial advice
02:29:42 no, well, they shouldn't
02:29:46 I encourage that behavior
02:29:48 bitcoin is, oh, no, it went up
02:29:50 no, it went up a bit, it's over 50
02:29:52 oh, no, it's over 50
02:29:56 bros, what do we do?
02:29:58 it's over 50
02:30:00 what are you gonna do, cry about it?
02:30:02 lie down and run
02:30:04 I'm gonna livestream tears
02:30:06 I'm gonna get a bucket
02:30:08 and they're gonna have the camera webcam on the bucket
02:30:10 and see how many tears fall
02:30:14 a lot
02:30:16 well, bummer
02:30:18 I was hoping it wouldn't go back up over 50
02:30:20 but it did
02:30:22 oh well
02:30:24 next voicemail
02:30:26 is called
02:30:28 wisdom potato
02:30:30 sorry, I'm finding it here
02:30:32 there and everywhere
02:30:34 okay, wisdom
02:30:36 wisdom potato
02:30:38 3, 2, 1, go
02:30:40 I hate the procrastinator's podcast
02:30:42 I fucking hate it
02:30:44 I can't get through a single point without
02:30:46 literally every single host
02:30:48 constantly, like vultures
02:30:50 try and jump on me
02:30:52 and cannibalize my point
02:30:54 to the point where it's unrecognizable
02:30:56 Gladys, I didn't know
02:30:58 you were on the procrastinator's podcast
02:31:00 I'm very sorry for trampling
02:31:02 all over your potato point
02:31:04 um
02:31:08 whatever
02:31:10 next one is called
02:31:12 join the F-A-G
02:31:14 parentheses
02:31:16 stomp out the red pill
02:31:18 what is this?
02:31:20 okay, okay
02:31:22 let's go
02:31:24 3, 2, 1, go
02:31:26 hey PCP, thank you so much
02:31:28 for all of these episodes, tons of
02:31:30 entertainment, keep them coming
02:31:32 um, you know, you've already given so much
02:31:34 but I'm just asking one more thing
02:31:36 um, you know, I understand
02:31:38 that this is a, you know, it went from the
02:31:40 most red pill podcast on the planet
02:31:42 to now probably the most blue pill podcast
02:31:44 on the planet, and I need your help
02:31:46 if you couldn't tell by my voice
02:31:48 I am a high schooler
02:31:50 probably one of the last high school HPCP
02:31:52 fans left, but that's neither here nor there
02:31:54 what happened is
02:31:56 the turning point USA
02:31:58 alt-right group
02:32:00 they're definitely redpilled as fuck
02:32:02 and they're putting up posters
02:32:04 all over my school because they started
02:32:06 their own fucking club
02:32:08 and it is angering
02:32:10 so what I've been doing is I've been working on
02:32:12 my own grassroots opposition
02:32:14 um, to them
02:32:16 and what I request from you guys
02:32:18 is um, we have an Instagram account
02:32:20 it's at fagpenrid
02:32:22 F-A-G-E-N-N-R-I-D-G-E
02:32:24 it's the fellowship of atheist gamers
02:32:26 and we're trying to
02:32:28 at least overtake them
02:32:30 and followers, we're at like
02:32:32 20 I think right now and they have
02:32:34 like 124 so it's not going to be
02:32:36 hard, but I think once we get
02:32:38 to that level I'm going to be able to
02:32:40 you know, I'm going to have a lot more firepower
02:32:42 you know, um, right, like I have
02:32:44 there's already a lot of infographics up there
02:32:46 they're just kind of parodies of the posters that they already have
02:32:48 hanging up, um, you know, I don't want to
02:32:50 toot my own horn, but I think they're pretty good
02:32:52 anyways, um, thanks for
02:32:54 your time
02:32:56 um, okay, funny cause
02:32:58 a bit of an edgy name, but
02:33:00 it's not so bad I guess
02:33:02 a bit of an edgy name
02:33:04 fuck turning point, they're cringe
02:33:06 I mean, yeah, fuck turning point
02:33:08 I think Munchie told me that like
02:33:10 at his school they're also like
02:33:12 turning point just kind of like shows up
02:33:14 oh no, and just kind of
02:33:16 they don't really like advertise it
02:33:18 they sort of like
02:33:20 will show up under like the guise of something else
02:33:22 but then like when you go and like talk to them
02:33:24 they'll be like, hey have you heard about turning point USA
02:33:26 uh, have you heard about
02:33:28 that the Democrats
02:33:30 you know, I'm looking at this
02:33:32 Instagram, I don't know if
02:33:34 the
02:33:36 the F slur angle
02:33:38 is going to be that useful
02:33:40 I feel like
02:33:42 like progressive types would be
02:33:44 pushed away, they're not going to be pulled
02:33:46 to turning point like
02:33:48 who are you, who are you
02:33:50 trying to get a reach with this
02:33:52 as a
02:33:54 as a dunk
02:33:56 like as a dunk against
02:33:58 turning point
02:34:00 because you know, it's F-A-G-G-O-T
02:34:02 a fellow Atheist
02:34:04 gamer's grassroots opposition to
02:34:06 turning point, I guess it's kind of funny
02:34:08 I do think it's a bit
02:34:10 is it a play on turning point, does turning point
02:34:12 have a similar acronym
02:34:16 uh, no
02:34:18 you should have taken
02:34:20 parody
02:34:22 it's not like a parody of turning point
02:34:24 it's funny, but like it's kind of like pointless
02:34:26 in why it's like that
02:34:28 pointless even
02:34:30 hmm
02:34:32 turning point less
02:34:34 okay, who was President Ronald Reagan
02:34:36 President Ronald
02:34:38 Ronald Redpilled Reagan was the 40th president
02:34:40 of the United States of America
02:34:42 uh, and the 16th
02:34:44 overall
02:34:46 Republican president, his most important act for the country
02:34:48 was his president for his work as an actor
02:34:50 bedtime for Bonzo is, without a doubt
02:34:52 the best and arguably most genre-defining
02:34:54 monkey movie of the 20th century
02:34:56 with a 5.4 out of 10 on IMDB
02:34:58 it takes the peak of presidential cinema
02:35:00 but enough about monkeys, let's talk about
02:35:02 those monkeys
02:35:04 from those African countries
02:35:06 damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes
02:35:08 yep, he said that
02:35:10 should have known better to trust Richard Nixon
02:35:12 in a private conversation, amazing right
02:35:14 who would have thought that an 80s era conservative
02:35:16 was racist
02:35:18 I thought I would talk about Reagan
02:35:20 well I guess
02:35:22 he's saying that Nixon like
02:35:24 leaked the con-
02:35:26 maybe Nixon wrote it down
02:35:28 and like that's how they know
02:35:30 Nixon had their seats for that beef
02:35:32 I think so, yeah
02:35:34 that sounds right
02:35:36 what I know turning point for
02:35:38 is the
02:35:40 fucking women's conference they did
02:35:42 which I saw a live stream
02:35:44 when Vosh like reviewed it
02:35:46 and these people
02:35:48 are actually insane
02:35:50 for the first like hour
02:35:52 actually no, if it was an hour or not
02:35:54 you mean turning point?
02:35:56 yeah, returning point women's conference
02:35:58 for the first hour I have this conservative woman up on stage
02:36:00 who's like, oh my god, cute servitives
02:36:02 you're so cool, we're gonna go out there
02:36:04 we're gonna be girl bosses
02:36:06 we're gonna get jobs and be business women
02:36:08 and it's gonna be so cool
02:36:10 and then Charlie Kirk goes on stage
02:36:12 looks at all the women and says
02:36:14 yeah, if you pursue a career
02:36:16 you're not gonna be happy
02:36:18 you need to stay in the home and not have a job
02:36:20 you're worthless and you will never be a man
02:36:22 and you can never be on the same foot as a man
02:36:24 and you suck and then all the women
02:36:26 cream their pants
02:36:28 it was funny
02:36:30 that's what they wanted, the first one is there to set them up
02:36:32 to set the pins up so Charlie could
02:36:34 just bowl them over and knock them all down
02:36:36 be like, yes
02:36:38 it was a
02:36:40 a false flag
02:36:42 it was a
02:36:44 a red herring
02:36:46 I think I support F.A.G
02:36:48 they're definitely
02:36:50 they're definitely better than the alternative
02:36:52 I like what they're doing
02:36:54 I support it, I support the name
02:36:56 I'm in a gay relationship, I can say it
02:36:58 it's a great idea
02:37:00 I think I would encourage people to
02:37:02 I think it would be pretty funny
02:37:04 if the fellowship of atheists gamers
02:37:06 were to defeat turning point
02:37:08 USA
02:37:10 at Penridge High School
02:37:12 I think I would call that a W
02:37:14 oh, okay
02:37:16 they say the F.A.G
02:37:18 is
02:37:20 a parody of
02:37:22 Penridge
02:37:24 turning point USA and F.C.A
02:37:26 which is the fellowship of Christian athletes
02:37:28 so I guess that's what
02:37:30 they're going to do
02:37:32 wait
02:37:34 I think I'm on board
02:37:36 yeah, if I used Instagram
02:37:38 I would give a follow
02:37:40 if only, if only I could use Instagram
02:37:42 I do
02:37:44 actually, I do have an old
02:37:46 Instagram that I have not logged into in years
02:37:48 so I don't know, maybe later
02:37:50 I'll try and hop on and see if I still remember
02:37:52 my password
02:37:54 Instagram
02:37:56 at F.A.G Penridge
02:37:58 with two ends
02:38:00 give them a like
02:38:02 give them a boost
02:38:04 I support it
02:38:06 next voicemail
02:38:08 is called
02:38:10 x8
02:38:12 here we go
02:38:14 x8
02:38:16 in three, two, one
02:38:18 go
02:38:20 he is
02:38:22 coming
02:38:26 Santa Claus
02:38:28 Santa Claus
02:38:30 to town
02:38:32 is x
02:38:34 is x8 like
02:38:36 an edgier version of
02:38:38 Nate
02:38:40 is it like the nobody
02:38:42 is it like Nate's nobody
02:38:44 oh shit, it is
02:38:46 it's gotta be
02:38:48 maybe
02:38:50 I can't think of what else to think
02:38:52 like they all have an X in their name
02:38:54 like Luxus and Zaynart
02:38:56 so Zate is the name
02:38:58 yeah
02:39:00 maybe
02:39:02 what would Nate's
02:39:04 nobody, would it be like
02:39:06 Texan
02:39:08 Exant
02:39:10 I think Exant is pretty good
02:39:12 Texan
02:39:14 yeah
02:39:16 Texan
02:39:18 Tenza
02:39:20 Zenat, I don't know, I'm just typing random shit
02:39:22 Zenat
02:39:24 is probably closest to what it could be
02:39:26 I don't know the name of the convention
02:39:28 I don't like that one
02:39:30 because it has the nat
02:39:32 it's not different enough
02:39:34 you're right
02:39:36 you're so right
02:39:38 one of those other ones I said was probably pretty good
02:39:40 I'm so right
02:39:42 next voicemail
02:39:44 is called
02:39:46 let me find it
02:39:48 a message about one piece being political
02:39:50 oh no
02:39:52 oh yeah
02:39:54 here we go
02:39:56 3, 2, 1
02:39:58 this is from Berserk Chip
02:40:00 3, 2, 1, go
02:40:02 so I'm out of the loop
02:40:04 I'm behind a couple episodes
02:40:06 it's been busy
02:40:08 so I don't know what the deal is with calling one piece political
02:40:10 I don't know if we're trolling conservatives or something
02:40:12 but
02:40:14 you said at one point
02:40:16 the show is clearly political
02:40:18 because the world government
02:40:20 are the bad guys
02:40:22 Ben
02:40:24 it's a show about pirates
02:40:26 of course
02:40:28 law enforcement and government bodies
02:40:30 are gonna pose an antagonistic force
02:40:32 when it's a show about pirates
02:40:34 it's like saying the show Dexter is anti-cop
02:40:36 because the cops get in his way sometimes
02:40:38 when he's trying to serial kill people
02:40:40 I'm cringing
02:40:42 now I'm not saying one piece isn't political
02:40:44 but like if you're gonna say that
02:40:46 if that's the meme
02:40:48 you gotta have a better argument
02:40:50 like
02:40:52 one piece is political because
02:40:54 Luffy only ever cares about himself
02:40:56 and his tightly knit family
02:40:58 and that's like a staunchly conservative mindset
02:41:00 if you're gonna say it's political
02:41:02 I would go with something closer to that
02:41:04 anyway
02:41:06 I love you and I was
02:41:08 dumb
02:41:10 this is really dumb
02:41:12 you're right
02:41:14 that obviously
02:41:16 it's a story about outlaws
02:41:18 the government is the antagonists
02:41:20 to our protagonist
02:41:22 yes obviously that's true
02:41:24 but like
02:41:26 think about how the world government is
02:41:28 portrayed
02:41:30 do you think
02:41:32 do they seem good
02:41:34 are they portrayed as though they're doing
02:41:36 what's right and they just happen to be
02:41:38 at odds with the protagonist
02:41:40 no
02:41:42 they're evil and it's because they have all this
02:41:44 systemic power that they abuse
02:41:46 it's so obvious
02:41:48 it's so obviously about
02:41:50 the government is bad, the police are bad
02:41:52 here are the ways that they're bad
02:41:54 and that's reflected in
02:41:56 one piece, it's obviously true
02:41:58 give me a fucking break
02:42:00 the thing with like
02:42:02 cops and robbers
02:42:04 the show chooses to show the robbers
02:42:06 the pirates in a good light
02:42:08 and to show them the protagonist
02:42:10 the main character
02:42:12 good-hearted monkey Luffy
02:42:14 as like a pirate
02:42:16 clearly implying
02:42:18 then a political message
02:42:20 that not all people determine
02:42:22 like Daned as criminals
02:42:24 are bad and the world government
02:42:26 is the one who decides who is a criminal who isn't
02:42:28 all Luffy wants to do is explore the ocean
02:42:30 he's not like actually a bad person
02:42:32 it's not like
02:42:34 you make a show
02:42:36 and it's about this
02:42:38 raper and he loves raping
02:42:40 you wouldn't show him as like the protagonist
02:42:42 as a good character
02:42:44 and then the police are
02:42:46 like
02:42:48 choosing who
02:42:50 is the good guy
02:42:52 is itself like a political statement
02:42:54 are you saying that rape man
02:42:56 my favorite anime is political?
02:43:00 it's very reductive
02:43:02 it's very reductive to be like
02:43:04 the show's about a pirate
02:43:06 so of course the bad
02:43:08 the police are the good guys
02:43:10 or are they
02:43:12 like there's no
02:43:14 nuance in that read
02:43:16 it doesn't take into account
02:43:18 what a pirate is
02:43:20 a lot of people don't know what it means
02:43:22 for something to be political
02:43:24 I think a lot of right-wingers
02:43:26 or otherwise
02:43:28 centrists would assume
02:43:30 that thing being called
02:43:32 political means
02:43:34 it's like
02:43:36 a character similar to how
02:43:38 drug PSAs happened in cartoons
02:43:40 in the 80s where the main character
02:43:42 of a popular TV show would
02:43:44 turn to the camera and say
02:43:46 hey kids, stay in school, don't do drugs
02:43:48 political messaging from your government
02:43:50 the America
02:43:52 that's not what being political means
02:43:54 being political is just having
02:43:56 an opinion on the way anything works
02:43:58 to be honest
02:44:00 I'll be honest
02:44:02 you could definitely take
02:44:04 a right-wing or libertarian message
02:44:06 away from one piece if you wanted
02:44:08 there's a really easy argument there
02:44:10 to be like
02:44:12 the government is incompetent
02:44:14 we need to reduce the size of government
02:44:16 everybody
02:44:18 we need to form tightly knit
02:44:20 clans and look out for our own
02:44:22 and that's what Luffy does
02:44:24 with the straw hats
02:44:26 he gets a clan together
02:44:28 and they look out for their own
02:44:30 and they live in this world
02:44:32 of the strongest
02:44:34 whatever
02:44:36 they live in a meritocracy
02:44:38 they have to prove themselves
02:44:40 in the marketplace of ideas
02:44:42 that is the grand line
02:44:44 and the competition for who will find
02:44:46 Raftel or whatever
02:44:48 you could totally make that argument
02:44:50 example of
02:44:52 an anime that has
02:44:54 an outlaw as the
02:44:56 protagonist and law enforcement
02:44:58 as the antagonist
02:45:00 that I would say probably is apolitical
02:45:02 and that one
02:45:04 the main character is a thief
02:45:06 and his opponent is
02:45:08 Inspector Zenigata
02:45:10 but like
02:45:12 neither one of them is portrayed as particularly
02:45:14 good and Lupin
02:45:16 he's pretty amoral but he's just doing
02:45:18 what he wants but he's likable
02:45:20 whereas Zenigata
02:45:22 is not really representative of
02:45:24 law enforcement as a whole
02:45:26 he's just one bumbling idiot
02:45:28 who is kind of acting on his own
02:45:30 right?
02:45:32 that doesn't really say anything about
02:45:34 the role of the police
02:45:36 or the government in society
02:45:38 one piece definitely does
02:45:40 way more than the other
02:45:42 I mean the Tenryubito
02:45:44 literally living at the top of the world
02:45:46 breathing different air
02:45:48 the Tenryubito and the Goro say
02:45:50 and they're completely protected
02:45:52 from all of the bad things they do
02:45:54 by the world government who they basically own
02:45:56 it's so clear that there's
02:45:58 there's
02:46:00 class inequality in one piece
02:46:02 in the world of one piece there's inequality
02:46:04 there are bad people
02:46:06 and good people
02:46:08 it's super obvious that systemic inequality
02:46:10 is such a huge fucking
02:46:12 theme in one piece I don't understand
02:46:14 how you can fancy
02:46:16 the whole fishman arc
02:46:18 the whole fucking fishman arc is about it
02:46:20 everyone can see that and they'll be like
02:46:22 that's a thing in one piece
02:46:24 some people don't understand
02:46:26 that's political for some reason
02:46:28 I don't know what they're imagining
02:46:30 exactly political meaning
02:46:32 maybe they're just getting caught up
02:46:34 in like twitter argument things
02:46:36 they assume
02:46:38 I don't know
02:46:40 political means when a character says
02:46:42 trans rights out loud or
02:46:44 something super explicit
02:46:46 that guy
02:46:48 who started that argument on twitter
02:46:50 I think his name was like
02:46:52 black D gamer
02:46:54 what was his name
02:46:56 his take was like
02:46:58 he would say stuff like yeah
02:47:00 like there is racism
02:47:02 yeah there is racism against
02:47:04 fishman in one piece
02:47:06 but like it's not about that
02:47:08 and it doesn't like say anything about it
02:47:10 it's just background
02:47:12 it's just background texture
02:47:14 for the story to happen
02:47:16 against
02:47:18 it doesn't say anything
02:47:20 it doesn't even say that it's bad
02:47:22 none of the characters react in any way
02:47:24 to the fact that slavery is there
02:47:26 they don't even get sad
02:47:28 they're all just like well I guess
02:47:30 we'll just have a fight with someone
02:47:32 not about that
02:47:34 but just in front of it
02:47:36 adjacent to it
02:47:38 I don't know
02:47:40 I don't
02:47:42 have any political interpretation of one piece
02:47:44 but there's also nowadays
02:47:46 this conflict
02:47:48 between the young pirates
02:47:50 these old fashion pirates
02:47:52 which is basically
02:47:54 a reality of
02:47:56 Japanese politics nowadays
02:47:58 like it's time to
02:48:00 the young ones
02:48:02 to step up and the lizards
02:48:04 to just go sleep
02:48:06 because Japan is still
02:48:08 ruled by a lot of old
02:48:10 fashion rules and politics
02:48:12 that they don't work
02:48:14 they don't work
02:48:16 Shin Godzilla
02:48:18 that movie
02:48:20 it's all about that
02:48:22 this is the only message of that movie
02:48:24 so you could also
02:48:26 it's about big lizard go boom
02:48:28 if you look at
02:48:30 the arc of
02:48:32 Wano itself
02:48:34 Wano being the Japan allegory
02:48:36 because it's the Japanese island in the world of one piece
02:48:38 there's so many parallels
02:48:40 to historical events
02:48:42 relating to Japan being closed off
02:48:44 from the rest of the world
02:48:46 which is why
02:48:48 they were
02:48:50 held back technologically
02:48:52 they don't have guns in Wano
02:48:54 they don't have like
02:48:56 dendin mushes and stuff
02:48:58 and the world government
02:49:00 sort of an allegory for America and western civilization
02:49:02 is like trying to get in
02:49:04 they're trying to open the country
02:49:06 there's like so many like
02:49:08 things in one piece
02:49:10 that seem just like
02:49:12 cool plot points in world building
02:49:14 I don't expect people to
02:49:16 understand the political
02:49:18 messaging of
02:49:20 it's clearly all there
02:49:22 to say with confidence
02:49:24 that there's nothing political about anything in one piece
02:49:26 is so weird
02:49:28 the people that I was arguing with
02:49:30 who get mad if you suggest that there's any
02:49:32 meaning to it at all
02:49:34 are like
02:49:36 they think that when you say
02:49:38 there's a political message
02:49:40 or there's a political meaning to it
02:49:42 you're saying that like
02:49:44 you're saying that
02:49:46 that's all it is
02:49:48 and there and like
02:49:50 in their mind that makes it like
02:49:52 that's like to call it
02:49:54 like not a real story
02:49:56 or something you're devaluing it
02:49:58 by saying that
02:50:00 when literally all I think
02:50:02 is just that like
02:50:04 the things that happened in the story
02:50:06 and the choices that Oda made in how he constructed it
02:50:08 say something
02:50:10 and illustrate
02:50:12 some ideas
02:50:14 that's literally it
02:50:16 but I don't know some people
02:50:18 are upset
02:50:20 I mean I know that like
02:50:22 there's like
02:50:24 there are
02:50:26 YouTubers who will talk and complain
02:50:28 about like woke things
02:50:30 in other cartoons
02:50:32 or media where it's like
02:50:34 they're pushing the transgender that oh
02:50:36 there's a gay wedding in Steven Universe
02:50:38 is like some aspect of like
02:50:40 it's political
02:50:42 quote unquote is to be
02:50:44 doing something
02:50:46 that's like
02:50:48 when there's a gay wedding that's political
02:50:50 but when like you know
02:50:52 a class of people that exist at the top
02:50:54 of society you know oppress
02:50:56 everyone underneath them
02:50:58 in order to you know maintain
02:51:00 the social hierarchy that's not political
02:51:02 that's just like that's just texture
02:51:04 I think like
02:51:06 I don't know exactly what these people believe
02:51:08 but I get a sense
02:51:10 there's at least some
02:51:12 people who see videos like that
02:51:14 think of the word political
02:51:16 meaning progressive
02:51:18 and then when they say one piece is political
02:51:20 they think well I don't believe
02:51:22 in this
02:51:24 this woke agenda so it's not political
02:51:26 actually and they just shut down
02:51:28 things are only political if they're being
02:51:30 done for the culture war
02:51:32 when Rebecca Sugar had a gay wedding
02:51:34 in her show she didn't do it because
02:51:36 she like liked the idea
02:51:38 or because she just wanted it to happen
02:51:40 or one of those characters to be together
02:51:42 she did it to put a middle finger
02:51:44 to the conservatives to be like
02:51:46 haha I'm brainwashing your kids that's why she did it
02:51:48 that's how they see things
02:51:50 I mean true and good for them
02:51:52 good for Rebecca
02:51:58 oh god
02:52:00 I guess a right
02:52:02 wing person would probably look at
02:52:04 the Tenryubito
02:52:06 and I don't know I'm just guessing here but my
02:52:08 assumption is they would assume that what
02:52:10 the Tenryubito
02:52:12 the real world analog of the Tenryubito
02:52:14 would be like the billionaire
02:52:16 pedophile elites
02:52:18 that are like
02:52:20 which is like
02:52:22 I guess you could maybe
02:52:24 make that parallel but like it doesn't make as much
02:52:26 sense because the Tenryubito
02:52:28 is a
02:52:30 common thing it's not like
02:52:32 it's not like a
02:52:34 you know buy your way in
02:52:36 you know
02:52:38 so it doesn't make as much sense to me but I guess
02:52:40 maybe you could
02:52:42 try and claim something like that
02:52:44 everybody loves one piece because the idea
02:52:46 of being the little man
02:52:48 I would respect that more than just be like
02:52:50 no it doesn't mean anything
02:52:52 no no it's an adventure story it's for kids it doesn't mean anything
02:52:54 there's no ideas
02:52:56 there are no ideas in this story
02:52:58 you just think about like
02:53:00 when Luffy punches a guy who told
02:53:02 it like haha I treat my
02:53:04 subordinates bad and I'm an asshole
02:53:06 and then Luffy punches him it's like yeah I
02:53:08 feel so good that that guy got beat
02:53:10 I love Luffy because
02:53:12 he cares about his Nakama and it's like
02:53:14 so there's no meaning to any of that
02:53:16 you know you think there's nothing there
02:53:18 of course there's something there everybody knows
02:53:20 there's something there that's why one piece is so
02:53:22 popular everybody loves
02:53:24 being you know rooting for the guy
02:53:26 oppressed by
02:53:28 you know ah my boss
02:53:30 the fucking government ah big thing
02:53:32 that is like hard to
02:53:34 comprehend that is controlling my life
02:53:36 I want freedom I want
02:53:38 me to be the one who punches people
02:53:40 everyone loves that everyone knows what
02:53:42 that feels like and that's why one piece is so
02:53:44 successful and it's just
02:53:46 it's just sad
02:53:48 to see that like I feel it makes me really mad
02:53:50 makes me really upset
02:53:52 people who get upset and argue about this stuff
02:53:54 really a lot of common ground there anyway
02:53:56 they're just not thinking about it right
02:53:58 and it's it's
02:54:00 upsetting a little bit
02:54:02 for sure for sure
02:54:04 um alright so that okay
02:54:06 then there's another one it's called an addendum
02:54:08 to the message about one piece
02:54:10 the beat I know
02:54:12 I know I know
02:54:14 sorry
02:54:16 but it's shorter it's shorter
02:54:18 there you go
02:54:20 okay three two
02:54:22 one let's jam
02:54:24 um okay so I
02:54:26 wrote the script for that voicemail
02:54:28 that I just sent about the one piece thing
02:54:30 and then I sent it
02:54:32 and then like five minutes later I was like
02:54:34 oh shit that kind of makes me sound like a conservative
02:54:36 so just to work clear I'm not a conservative
02:54:38 I don't like conservatives
02:54:40 they're mean to me in the YouTube comment section
02:54:42 I don't like them I just couldn't think of a liberal
02:54:44 way to say that one piece is
02:54:46 political if
02:54:48 I'll keep thinking about it
02:54:50 maybe I'll find it for you
02:54:52 then I promise I'll try
02:54:54 you mean isn't you mean isn't political
02:54:56 right
02:54:58 this guy they were saying
02:55:00 can't even keep his story straight
02:55:02 I don't even
02:55:04 what's even the point
02:55:06 I whatever
02:55:08 noted you are whatever
02:55:10 chip you're fucking
02:55:12 dead I see
02:55:14 if I see you out on the grand line
02:55:16 I'm fucking I'm fucking pillaging you
02:55:18 I'm reading you
02:55:20 something like Luffy just
02:55:22 cares about himself or his crew
02:55:24 that's it
02:55:26 have you ever read
02:55:28 one piece have you actually read
02:55:30 one piece have you read
02:55:32 alabasta or skypea
02:55:34 Luffy feels very strongly
02:55:36 for helping
02:55:38 people who are nice
02:55:40 and who he thinks
02:55:42 deserve to be helped
02:55:44 yeah
02:55:46 I think so
02:55:48 it's very simple
02:55:50 he acts selfishly
02:55:52 he acts selfish sometimes
02:55:54 well he acts selfish but it's like
02:55:56 for things that are not really that important
02:55:58 when somebody is getting hurt
02:56:00 like he doesn't just sit back and let it happen
02:56:02 he doesn't like that
02:56:04 he's the first one to act
02:56:08 okay so next voicemail

03:02:32 stealing something
03:02:34 exactly
03:02:36 these liberals are going crazy
03:02:38 that fucking guy
03:02:40 this was maybe a couple weeks ago on twitter but there was shoplifting discourse
03:02:42 and someone was like
03:02:44 shoplifting is
03:02:46 he called it looting
03:02:48 but what he was actually talking about was shoplifting
03:02:50 but he implied that
03:02:52 people shoplifting
03:02:54 from stores
03:02:56 carries the risk of they coming with guns
03:02:58 and they're gonna hold you up at gunpoint
03:03:00 hold up the cashiers
03:03:02 and hold up the store employees
03:03:04 and it's like
03:03:06 no
03:03:08 that's armed robbery
03:03:10 that's a different crime
03:03:12 than the one you're describing an epidemic of
03:03:14 you fuck
03:03:16 but some people are just like
03:03:18 all crime is the same
03:03:20 any form of theft carries
03:03:22 with it the threat that the thief will
03:03:24 put the object
03:03:26 in a big bag with a money sign on it
03:03:28 and then pull out guns and knives and swords
03:03:30 and threaten you with them
03:03:32 this is just what criminals do
03:03:34 it's all
03:03:36 more ass in my mind
03:03:38 I can't distinguish between anything
03:03:42 that's what happened
