00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:26 First one back from Radcon, boys!
00:00:33 I am the best guy ever, and we're joined by Mr. Munchy.
00:00:50 Give me the chocolate.
00:00:53 Ben Saint is here.
00:00:55 Yes, Nate. Mr. Munchy is Munchy's father's name.
00:00:59 No, he has an unrelated name. Munchy is, you know, and Hippocrit is here as well.
00:01:08 I'm a nice guy to everyone, but myself.
00:01:12 And a special guest, Mr. Double Munchy, Munchy's father.
00:01:18 Hello everyone, it's me, Mr. Munchy. This is Double Munchy.
00:01:22 Munchy, I supplied the chocolate. That's why my son is so fast, because I have the bat chocolate right before me.
00:01:29 I am into forest feeding. That's my soul cake. No penetration, no any sex-only chocolate.
00:01:38 Well, there he is. Thanks for joining us, Double Munchy.
00:01:41 Let's give him a big round of applause.
00:01:43 Thanks for being here. Thanks for stopping by.
00:01:45 Alright, enough retardation. What's the topic here? Define it. What's going on? Tell us.
00:01:50 Alright, here you go, everybody. The topic today is why being nice sucks.
00:01:55 Why being nice is reprehensible behavior that you should not partake in.
00:02:00 But, Nate, what is the word nice mean? Like, does it mean something with army vets? Is it some sort of pension plan?
00:02:08 Is there something to do with these?
00:02:10 Let me tell you that that's right. That's a very nice thing.
00:02:15 Here we go. Nice. Adjective. Nice. An adjective used to describe someone with exceptional skill in a certain area.
00:02:24 The term is never used pejoratively or sarcastically.
00:02:29 And here's the example. My man is real nice on the microphone.
00:02:34 Stop. Stop. That is the worst possible joke.
00:02:39 Here's another one. Nice. This one has a bunch of definitions.
00:02:44 You're going to like this.
00:02:46 I doubt it very much.
00:02:48 I don't know where this, like, talented thing is coming from. I mean, I guess it's sort of...
00:02:52 Number one, talented.
00:02:54 Number two, an interjection similar to saying word when you are in agreement with what someone just said or you approve of what they said.
00:03:01 Wait.
00:03:03 Number three, high on marijuana.
00:03:07 These are the worst fucking jokes.
00:03:11 There's another one that says nice, something you say to the guy you don't want to fuck.
00:03:15 Like, hey, you're a real nice guy, dot, dot, dot, but pregnant pause in my non-pregnant vulva.
00:03:24 Mmm.
00:03:26 Well, this is a literal catastrophe.
00:03:31 This is terrible. There are literally no good definitions of the word nice.
00:03:37 I don't think any of these captured.
00:03:39 Here's my definition of the word nice.
00:03:41 Nice is nice, but it's not great. That's what I think.
00:03:46 You know what? Actually, there is one more. That is pretty accurate.
00:03:49 Here's like a longer definition. This one's like kind of okay.
00:03:53 Used by men to describe all women in an off-handed way when expressing their real opinions will cause them great troubles.
00:04:01 For example, they could be under threat of being slapped or dumped by their girlfriends or getting punched and kicked into a pile by their buddies.
00:04:10 Oh my God, this is terrible. These are all bad.
00:04:12 Punched or kicked into a pile by their buddies.
00:04:14 By their buddy? Like, what?
00:04:16 Hey man, what?
00:04:18 You don't fucking talk that way about a lady.
00:04:20 Roundhouse kick into the pile like the rest of the misogynist.
00:04:23 I've got a bag full of misogynists that I'm gonna stuff you into.
00:04:26 If one of my friends ever comes up to me and starts telling me that I'm not treating my GF enough like a queen, we're gonna have some problems.
00:04:35 He's gonna knock you into a pile.
00:04:40 Okay guys, we have to do it. We have to deviate from our God canon here.
00:04:45 I come up with our own definition.
00:04:47 We cannot do it.
00:04:48 We must. Like, below this is number six.
00:04:51 The plan is all we have.
00:04:53 Number one, skillful.
00:04:55 Number two, high.
00:04:57 Why is high? Why?
00:04:59 Why was high on there a few times?
00:05:01 Why is like weed related to the word nice in any way?
00:05:05 What?
00:05:06 I think we're behind the times guys.
00:05:08 I think we're obsolete.
00:05:10 Number seven, nice. Aesthetically pleasing.
00:05:13 That's like kind of...
00:05:15 That's sort of specific.
00:05:17 Nice is a very vague term.
00:05:19 According to Google search.
00:05:21 Nice is an adjective mean pleasant, agreeable, satisfactory.
00:05:25 Well, there you go.
00:05:27 Maybe we should use Google instead of...
00:05:30 Maybe we should Bing it guys.
00:05:32 Maybe we should Bing it.
00:05:34 We really should be Bing it.
00:05:36 That's the solution here.
00:05:38 What a fucking clusterfuck.
00:05:40 Defining nice has been the greatest clusterfuck in all PCB history.
00:05:43 You know what I'll bet?
00:05:45 I'll bet there's some like...
00:05:47 Child's play. Baby shit.
00:05:49 Trying to find out what the word nice means impossible.
00:05:52 Hey, what's that website that has like...
00:05:55 It's always like how to blank,
00:05:57 and then there'll be a bunch of steps with like really ugly drawings.
00:06:00 Rimezone.org?
00:06:02 No, no, no.
00:06:04 Yeah, yeah.
00:06:06 Let's go on wiki how and look up how to be nice.
00:06:09 Yeah, okay.
00:06:11 Let's see what we got.
00:06:13 I hate this.
00:06:15 This is not nice right now.
00:06:17 I'm gonna give an abbreviator.
00:06:19 Number one, smile.
00:06:21 Number two, acknowledge other people.
00:06:23 Number three, be a good listener.
00:06:25 Number four, be courteous, polite, and helpful.
00:06:28 You're welcome. Thank you.
00:06:30 Let me just amend that to include trustworthy, loyal,
00:06:32 helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,
00:06:34 obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.
00:06:36 To my scouts.
00:06:38 Number five, practice empathy.
00:06:40 Ooh, I don't know about that one.
00:06:42 I'm gonna have to crush that one.
00:06:44 Look at this picture of Nate,
00:06:46 best guy ever being empathetic.
00:06:48 I'm fucking blind.
00:06:50 I am blind in this situation.
00:06:52 He had to...
00:06:54 He's losing his sight.
00:06:56 He had to develop a new sense.
00:06:58 A new sense to help him navigate the world.
00:07:00 And that sense was empathetic.
00:07:02 What you're actually describing here is Mr. Clean
00:07:04 being nice to me post blindness
00:07:06 because it's the other guy asking for help
00:07:08 or asking if this blind man needs help.
00:07:10 You're not only blind, you're actually like hobbling.
00:07:12 That's not a walking stick.
00:07:14 That is a crutch you're holding.
00:07:16 My legs have been destroyed.
00:07:18 This evolves into monsters 2.0.
00:07:20 We could be not spending all our time on WikiHow.
00:07:22 We spent eight minutes trying to find out
00:07:24 what the word fucking nice means.
00:07:26 We have to get back on track here.
00:07:28 Pleasant.
00:07:30 Pleasant is really what it means.
00:07:32 Allow me to have the floor.
00:07:34 Allow me to have the micro pass.
00:07:36 Wait, wait, wait. First, I just want to say
00:07:38 that I don't think anything in the world bothers me
00:07:40 as much as the drawings on WikiHow.
00:07:42 They're very...
00:07:44 It's worse than that.
00:07:46 The kind of feeling I get
00:07:48 looking at WikiHow.
00:07:50 It's kind of like how when you see furry art
00:07:52 that's really furry and it's like,
00:07:54 it's got that furry feeling about it.
00:07:56 WikiHow is the same.
00:07:58 The dial of Mario's turned to maximum for way past
00:08:00 the legal amount.
00:08:02 The drawings on WikiHow is kind of similar
00:08:04 to my problems with being nice in general.
00:08:06 It's kind of just like basic.
00:08:08 It's kind of boring.
00:08:10 It's kind of uninteresting and surface level.
00:08:12 That leads into my...
00:08:14 I want to have the first word here.
00:08:16 This topic is
00:08:18 vile and embarrassing.
00:08:20 This topic literally
00:08:22 makes me feel like
00:08:24 sad that I live in a world
00:08:26 and I live in a group
00:08:28 where this topic can be seen as
00:08:30 okay to be. I can't believe it's real.
00:08:32 I cannot believe
00:08:34 that we are such a fucking
00:08:36 pretentious, sanctimonious, conceded
00:08:38 group that the topic
00:08:40 why being nice sucks
00:08:42 is treated with any sort of respect
00:08:44 whatsoever. It's embarrassing
00:08:46 and frankly, I think this is the worst topic.
00:08:48 Not like a mom...
00:08:50 Did you not suggest this topic?
00:08:52 This is the worst topic because it just shows
00:08:54 a look into our souls
00:08:56 and how dirty and broken we are.
00:08:58 In times, don't treat the PCP like their idols.
00:09:00 We are broken individuals
00:09:02 but that cannot be resonated
00:09:04 any higher than it is
00:09:06 right now with the topic
00:09:08 why being nice sucks. This proves
00:09:10 that none of us have love or
00:09:12 deserve love and we should be shot
00:09:14 immediately if you see us in the streets.
00:09:16 Any of us.
00:09:18 Was this not your suggestion?
00:09:20 Yeah.
00:09:22 Oh my god.
00:09:24 It was
00:09:26 but only because I hated it so much
00:09:28 that it was on the docket.
00:09:30 Fair enough. Listen
00:09:32 the reason why it is
00:09:34 perfectly reasonable to bring up this
00:09:36 topic is because just like Ben
00:09:38 everyone out there isn't using their brain
00:09:40 properly when they think about the world.
00:09:42 Tell me more.
00:09:44 Being nice is the most
00:09:46 shameful
00:09:48 course of action
00:09:50 that one can take in their life.
00:09:52 Listen, listen.
00:09:54 This is going to come down to the
00:09:56 topic of like nice guys for me.
00:09:58 That's what it boils down to.
00:10:00 Nice girls and anybody. Nice guys
00:10:02 finish last.
00:10:04 It is the most quoted
00:10:06 phrase in human history for a reason
00:10:08 and it's because it's so true.
00:10:10 Everyone understands this on an
00:10:12 instinctual biological level.
00:10:14 Being nice is a mistake
00:10:16 across the board.
00:10:18 Never apologize for who you are.
00:10:20 I have to take my wheelchair.
00:10:22 Never apologize for what you need.
00:10:24 I feel like I'm on
00:10:26 both sides of this because like
00:10:28 I understand that
00:10:30 yeah nice guys finish last
00:10:32 for a reason it's true but
00:10:34 I like being nice.
00:10:36 I like being wholesome and good
00:10:38 and doing good things for people.
00:10:40 Well, no.
00:10:42 The thing is
00:10:44 there's no pressure here.
00:10:46 This can be overdone and I think
00:10:48 that's what nice guys finish last
00:10:50 means because if a nice guy has nothing
00:10:52 but being nice they will not
00:10:54 get very far. They have to be cool as well.
00:10:56 Hold on. I'm sure this
00:10:58 realistically doesn't need to be said because
00:11:00 we can all imagine what Nate's position is.
00:11:02 We already know it in our mind but
00:11:04 obviously you're going to come down hard
00:11:06 on being nice because that's just the kind of guy you are.
00:11:08 So please explain your relationship
00:11:10 with being nice and having warmth
00:11:12 and loving. Let me blackpill everybody
00:11:14 as I do all the time on being nice.
00:11:16 Listen, being nice is a fucking
00:11:18 scheme to make you subservient
00:11:20 to the rest of the world. It is a literal
00:11:22 trick. Don't do it.
00:11:24 Don't fucking do it. Okay, here's the real deal.
00:11:26 Let's say you're a guy and you're
00:11:28 just like a 16-year-old guy
00:11:30 and you want a girlfriend. How do you
00:11:32 get the girlfriend? Yeah,
00:11:34 it makes out for life my brothers but
00:11:36 putting that aside, let's say this is your goal.
00:11:38 You don't get there by
00:11:40 just going around and being pleasant.
00:11:42 You get it by just doing the things
00:11:44 that you want to do in life and then people
00:11:46 gravitate to your animal
00:11:48 like sexuality and bags.
00:11:50 It's already like, the argument
00:11:52 here is not that niceness
00:11:54 is bad. It's just that it is not
00:11:56 a substitute for a real personality.
00:11:58 It is not a personality type in
00:12:00 itself. That's the thing though. It's just a set of
00:12:02 like, you know,
00:12:04 give people the benefit of the doubt.
00:12:06 Don't die on
00:12:08 every single hill of every argument
00:12:10 you have. It's just
00:12:12 like a code of
00:12:14 don't be a dick and it's not a personality
00:12:16 that you can astrive yourself
00:12:18 and if you try to, you will finish last
00:12:20 because that's not real.
00:12:22 I have a personal
00:12:24 history. I definitely have personal issues
00:12:26 when it comes to niceness because my
00:12:28 childhood, I
00:12:30 did the whole being a nice guy thing
00:12:32 and it did not work out and I deeply
00:12:34 resent the people who kind of
00:12:36 implied that that was the right way to go.
00:12:38 If I instead
00:12:40 be a nice boy, you'll get what you want.
00:12:42 Not true.
00:12:44 The idea that
00:12:46 the word nice has been boiled down to
00:12:48 just specifically being a nice guy
00:12:50 is very narrow
00:12:52 but that's fine.
00:12:54 In relation to nice guys
00:12:56 I completely agree that
00:12:58 you shouldn't just be like a nice guy
00:13:00 because that
00:13:02 just makes you a weirdo asshole
00:13:04 but I really don't
00:13:06 like why is being nice
00:13:08 bad exactly?
00:13:10 Why don't you want to be nice and just
00:13:12 live your life as a nice person
00:13:14 and be a good nice person?
00:13:16 On a conceptual level
00:13:18 there is nothing wrong with being nice.
00:13:20 If you've got two guys
00:13:22 let's say you've got like
00:13:24 when I think of nice guys, I think of this
00:13:26 I heard a long time ago
00:13:28 and it was like if you've got
00:13:30 a girl who's attracted to two guys
00:13:32 and one is like a normal guy
00:13:34 first of all let me say slut
00:13:36 but continue.
00:13:38 Exactly.
00:13:40 Who is a woman going to be attracted to?
00:13:42 A really attractive guy
00:13:44 who is also nice
00:13:46 but this guy is like
00:13:48 rich, he's really fun to be around
00:13:50 he's exciting but then he's also really nice
00:13:52 and he treats her well
00:13:54 obviously that's literally the dream guy
00:13:56 but as opposed to
00:13:58 some average looking guy
00:14:00 but he's not quote unquote a nice guy
00:14:02 he's a little more rebellious.
00:14:04 The girl is going to be interested
00:14:06 in the guy who's got everything going on
00:14:08 and is also nice
00:14:10 because niceness in itself is not actually
00:14:12 a bad thing but
00:14:14 what it comes down to for me
00:14:16 and I know this is a personal thing
00:14:18 it's that when you're nice as your identity
00:14:20 I know that's what you were talking about before
00:14:22 and I think we're all in agreement on this
00:14:24 but it's when you use niceness as your
00:14:26 attractive trait and it's like I'm nice
00:14:28 therefore I deserve good things to happen
00:14:30 and as I was told to believe
00:14:32 earlier in my life
00:14:34 so I have big negative implications with it
00:14:36 I feel like there's layers
00:14:38 of being nice
00:14:40 where it's like nice as like a vague
00:14:42 like you know say please and thank you
00:14:44 but then there's like niceness in terms of
00:14:46 like you are
00:14:48 unconfrontational
00:14:50 you don't take a stance on any issue
00:14:52 all I'm saying is
00:14:54 if you don't hit
00:14:56 if you don't hit your significant other
00:14:58 she'll never know how good it is
00:15:00 when you're not hitting her
00:15:02 that's what I'm saying
00:15:04 this is retardation
00:15:06 all these blanket statements
00:15:08 about like what will
00:15:10 a girl like just a girl
00:15:12 that you've whipped up in your mind
00:15:14 what will she pick
00:15:16 guys don't need to be nice to each other
00:15:18 niceness is useless between men
00:15:20 it doesn't matter
00:15:22 you know exactly what it means
00:15:24 it means that we care about what each other can offer
00:15:26 on like a
00:15:28 yeah that's you Nate
00:15:30 I want to be nice to people
00:15:32 it's just a basic human instinct
00:15:34 to be nice to the people that you care about
00:15:36 this is where it comes down to
00:15:38 you being Nate
00:15:40 this is a Nate being Nate thing
00:15:42 if you're talking about like
00:15:44 Nate we were being nice to each other in the chat yesterday
00:15:46 and it was nice
00:15:48 did you notice Ben
00:15:50 you may not have noticed
00:15:52 I did not comment
00:15:54 yesterday we were all
00:15:56 I was saying like guys
00:15:58 okay I won't talk about what it was
00:16:00 but I specifically did not comment
00:16:02 in a positive way
00:16:04 and I almost commented like yeah I'm not gonna be a pussy
00:16:06 and like join this conversation
00:16:08 you were in there being
00:16:10 all sad about some shit
00:16:12 and then the rest of us were like
00:16:14 yeah we are also kinda sad about the shit
00:16:16 and the rest of us were like oh no it's fine
00:16:18 we're all gonna be fine
00:16:20 thank god that Nate
00:16:22 I'm not stooped to the level of being like
00:16:24 yeah you guys are okay too
00:16:26 yeah I maintained my frame
00:16:28 and that's why I smash the puss
00:16:30 on the daily
00:16:32 the problem here is just
00:16:34 it's a different point of perspective
00:16:36 it's a different world view
00:16:38 you see like us
00:16:40 well I'll speak for myself
00:16:42 I value
00:16:44 being nice I value human connection
00:16:46 I value
00:16:48 living my life to its fullest
00:16:50 I value
00:16:52 classical ideals
00:16:54 and I like when the world
00:16:56 is happy I like
00:16:58 when I am happy I like
00:17:00 good things and that's why I like being nice
00:17:02 because it is an unequivocal
00:17:04 good thing in almost
00:17:06 every context whatsoever
00:17:08 we can get to unconditional love I agree
00:17:10 that's not a Morley's town thing to do
00:17:12 but that's a 0.1%
00:17:14 there's not a whole lot
00:17:16 of real unconditional love
00:17:18 and most of it is just
00:17:20 people being nice to one of the people having
00:17:22 good emotional
00:17:24 connections with one another
00:17:26 and there's literally no reason to say that it's bad
00:17:28 there's literally no reason other
00:17:30 than to just sound sanctimonious
00:17:32 and be pretentious and put on air
00:17:34 and make yourself sound like you're
00:17:36 on your moille hygrim there's no reason
00:17:38 well that's what you're saying coming from your perspective
00:17:40 but that's not a full picture
00:17:42 like some people are emotionally manipulated by other people
00:17:44 and it is their nicest that allows them
00:17:46 to bend over to like
00:17:48 do what they're told and it's not always a good thing
00:17:50 you gotta watch out for that
00:17:52 the majority of people are just nice to one another
00:17:54 and they're not being manipulated or tricked
00:17:56 to do their unbelievable
00:17:58 stupidity of how the door
00:18:00 opened for such strangers
00:18:02 almost everyone is being manipulated
00:18:04 by someone in their life
00:18:06 in a deep way
00:18:08 that's what I would argue
00:18:10 you know someone? I didn't hear the first part of that
00:18:12 well I'm just yeah I think most
00:18:14 people are like everyone who's dating someone
00:18:16 is to some degree being manipulated by
00:18:18 that person it's just how it works
00:18:20 it doesn't mean it's negative or even a bad thing
00:18:22 but they are using
00:18:24 their emotions and the expectation
00:18:26 that the other person should be nice to them
00:18:28 these are like control mechanisms
00:18:30 we use over each other via society
00:18:32 and niceness is us
00:18:36 I'm not even saying it's insidious
00:18:38 I'm just saying that's just how people work
00:18:40 we're already seeing that this is sort of like
00:18:42 Nate wants to talk about Starfleet
00:18:44 we've got to stop this
00:18:46 we've got to crush it right now
00:18:48 I would like to talk about how empathy is good
00:18:50 and there's not enough of it
00:18:52 we've already done empathy
00:18:54 I totally agree that it's good though
00:18:56 what was our conclusion?
00:18:58 did we like empathy? did we not like it?
00:19:00 I'm still on the fence personally
00:19:02 let me just say that I actually think empathy is great
00:19:04 but I think that's totally different from niceness
00:19:06 I think they are too distinct
00:19:08 I think niceness is vague enough that it includes lots of things
00:19:10 and you are like
00:19:12 focusing on the sexual
00:19:14 the sexual courting aspect
00:19:16 of a nice guy
00:19:18 that is all you're thinking about
00:19:20 what can I say my dude
00:19:22 I always got pussy on the mind
00:19:24 yeah
00:19:26 we're sending you to jail now
00:19:30 the very first PC prisoner
00:19:32 right now
00:19:36 yes lock me up
00:19:38 it's gonna be dangerous for these ladies on the street
00:19:40 I am
00:19:42 the PC ratess
00:19:44 I think we can do an entire episode
00:19:46 on relationships but just related to
00:19:48 being nice real quick here
00:19:50 I am of the opinion that
00:19:52 you can just be a normal person
00:19:54 and like Nate said I completely agree
00:19:56 just live your life and eventually
00:19:58 people will come to you
00:20:00 that have similar interests
00:20:02 and are of similar mindsets
00:20:04 that just makes sense
00:20:06 this has nothing to do with that
00:20:08 well obviously
00:20:10 if you are a nice person
00:20:12 you will attract other nice people
00:20:14 or people are trying to manipulate you
00:20:16 I'm just saying
00:20:18 this whole courting
00:20:20 via measuring
00:20:22 does girls
00:20:24 do all girls want this nice person
00:20:26 or do all girls want someone
00:20:28 who is vaguely edgier
00:20:30 do all girls want someone who is rich and powerful
00:20:32 I just think it's unhelpful
00:20:34 it's better
00:20:36 I think if someone says that
00:20:38 they don't want that they're lying
00:20:40 you can probably draw some like
00:20:42 broad generalities
00:20:44 in what like certain demographics
00:20:46 want
00:20:48 I agree
00:20:50 I don't think it's very helpful
00:20:52 especially people who are listening to this podcast
00:20:54 who are like abnormal
00:20:56 no no no the people who listen to this podcast
00:20:58 are like teenage boys
00:21:00 and they need to hear this shit
00:21:02 we have adults
00:21:04 there are adults in the audience
00:21:06 I pray
00:21:08 I know they're there
00:21:10 I don't think that they should be listening to us
00:21:12 I don't think we're good influences
00:21:14 I disagree completely
00:21:16 I'm the best influence
00:21:18 I basically
00:21:20 when I come out here
00:21:22 I'm speaking to like young Nate
00:21:24 I'm trying to fix the mistakes
00:21:26 that young Nate made in anybody who's listening
00:21:28 and I want them to be aware of the lessons I've learned
00:21:30 well Nate if you didn't make those mistakes
00:21:32 you wouldn't have become Nate
00:21:34 but that's
00:21:36 not necessarily a good thing
00:21:38 like if I could be the same
00:21:40 did we agree on that
00:21:42 I mean I'm a deeply broken individual
00:21:44 and I'm totally aware of that
00:21:46 and if I could make someone have the same
00:21:48 guerrilla mindset that I have now
00:21:50 hang on hang on if you're a totally broken individual
00:21:52 how do we know what you're saying is a good advice
00:21:54 because it is intellectually
00:21:56 and logically sound
00:21:58 that's why
00:22:00 I don't know
00:22:02 this is a paradox
00:22:04 no it is not a paradox
00:22:06 just literally take my arguments and analyze them for flaws
00:22:08 if you don't find any then they're fine
00:22:10 if there are flaws then they are not fine
00:22:12 please do this to all my arguments all the time
00:22:14 and I will do it to everyone else's
00:22:16 I think most of the time
00:22:18 when you present an argument before the court here
00:22:20 most of the time
00:22:22 it's not exactly that there is
00:22:24 like a plot hole
00:22:26 it's just that
00:22:28 the point of view you're coming from
00:22:30 and your conclusions
00:22:32 most of the time I don't think
00:22:34 are anything that should be allowed
00:22:36 in society
00:22:38 well fuck you
00:22:40 it's your base assumptions
00:22:42 I think
00:22:44 that are a sticking point sometimes
00:22:46 not the actual logical argument
00:22:48 itself
00:22:50 the main difference that we're coming at here is
00:22:52 when I think about being nice
00:22:54 we focus in on like the relationship
00:22:56 aspects of niceness
00:22:58 whereas you guys are looking at it from a slightly broader context
00:23:00 we are looking at it from the cowards perspective
00:23:02 that's right
00:23:04 the blue-pilled cuck perspective
00:23:06 that's right
00:23:08 I think if we were being nice right now
00:23:10 we would be agreeing with you and be saying
00:23:12 exactly
00:23:14 I don't want you to be nice
00:23:16 maybe
00:23:18 obviously niceness
00:23:20 niceness 24-7 is not good
00:23:22 but any emotion
00:23:24 or any state of mind 100% 24-7
00:23:26 is not a good idea
00:23:28 over intelligence and anything is not a good idea
00:23:30 but for the basic
00:23:32 majority of all human interaction
00:23:34 niceness is the way to go
00:23:36 the one distinction I would make
00:23:38 there is that I would put niceness
00:23:40 below like being true to yourself
00:23:42 always
00:23:44 it's like always a lower priority
00:23:46 but I would give
00:23:48 what a grill name
00:23:50 it's examples of
00:23:52 when you can be nice and what you would do
00:23:54 and why
00:23:56 you're walking through a door
00:23:58 the person behind you
00:24:00 you know there's someone behind you
00:24:02 are you going to hold the door open
00:24:04 or are you going to hope that they push
00:24:06 forward and do it themselves
00:24:08 I'll tell you what I do
00:24:10 I analyze how far behind me the person is
00:24:12 and determine if it is worth my time
00:24:14 to hold the door open for them
00:24:16 but I'll tell you this
00:24:18 so you're being emotionally manipulated
00:24:20 to an insane stream of people behind you
00:24:22 to waste your time
00:24:24 I am emotionally manipulating them
00:24:26 by giving them a positive
00:24:28 conditioning view of me
00:24:30 by doing something nice for them
00:24:32 knowing that it could pay off in the future
00:24:34 I'm making an investment here
00:24:36 that's what I'm doing
00:24:38 I don't disagree that being nice to people
00:24:40 that you want them to like you
00:24:42 is like a thing that people do
00:24:44 the only thing is that I'm more blackpilled
00:24:46 that's why we do the things we do
00:24:48 I know that we're all just manipulating each other all the time
00:24:50 but you just call it being nice
00:24:52 I would say it's emotional manipulation
00:24:54 that's the only difference here
00:24:56 I don't disagree
00:24:58 I don't think about it as manipulation
00:25:00 in like a day to day
00:25:02 maybe I'll do a good thing
00:25:04 I'll do a nice thing to this person
00:25:06 maybe it'll be good for them
00:25:08 maybe it'll make somebody laugh today
00:25:10 maybe I'll increase
00:25:12 the happiness of the world
00:25:14 by like a certain amount
00:25:16 if we take the sort of vague
00:25:18 definition of manipulation
00:25:20 to just be like manipulation
00:25:22 the sense that you change things
00:25:24 to make certain outcomes appear
00:25:26 then literally every single action
00:25:28 that any human takes is manipulation
00:25:30 but I think there is an obvious social
00:25:32 what's the word
00:25:34 definition of the word manipulation
00:25:36 to be something
00:25:38 where you are intentionally tricking someone
00:25:40 to do something
00:25:42 that's kind of how I think about it
00:25:44 as I go about my life
00:25:46 so you think even in the situations
00:25:48 where you could just say
00:25:50 manipulation in the sense that
00:25:52 I'm changing words
00:25:54 I'm changing
00:25:56 ideas in my mind
00:25:58 to be words that people will like
00:26:00 a form of tricking and not just manipulation
00:26:02 since I'm changing
00:26:04 in a way, yes
00:26:06 the fact that you, Munchie, don't go out
00:26:08 and act as crazy as you do
00:26:10 when you're out in public
00:26:12 I would argue is like the same thing
00:26:14 as me like choosing to hold up
00:26:16 in doors for people who are nearby
00:26:18 because like you don't want the societal ramifications
00:26:20 the thing about it
00:26:22 all is that words are
00:26:24 terrible, I want to do a whole podcast
00:26:26 about language because
00:26:28 fuck language it sucks, it doesn't work
00:26:30 nobody uses it right
00:26:32 but like the fact that Nate is taking the word manipulation
00:26:34 and is applying it to all these
00:26:36 things and saying yes this is manipulation
00:26:38 when in my mind and the minds of most people
00:26:40 manipulation is a
00:26:42 by definition a negative
00:26:44 thing that you do not want to be doing
00:26:46 if you say I manipulate people
00:26:48 that gives like this connotation
00:26:50 of like oh here's a bad person
00:26:52 he thinks he's literally evil
00:26:54 and he likes it
00:26:56 that's the feeling the word manipulation gets
00:26:58 even if it technically doesn't mean that
00:27:00 it's just
00:27:02 language sucks and this is why
00:27:04 I like to be edgy, okay but listen
00:27:06 I have prepared a statement
00:27:08 of exactly how I am in real life
00:27:10 alright here's my statement
00:27:12 I'm on the PCP
00:27:14 my name is Nate Bestman
00:27:16 I'm 27 years old
00:27:18 I believe in taking care of myself
00:27:20 eat a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine
00:27:22 in the morning
00:27:24 I record the procrastinator's podcast
00:27:26 and if I have time
00:27:28 I record a bonus episode
00:27:30 I can do almost two now
00:27:32 after I finish recording the
00:27:34 podcast
00:27:36 blah blah blah blah I do all the stuff
00:27:38 I go to my workout I do a 3x3 blah blah blah
00:27:40 who cares okay here's the end
00:27:42 there is an idea of a best guy ever
00:27:44 some kind of abstraction
00:27:46 but there is no real Nate
00:27:48 only an entity something illusory
00:27:50 and though I can hide my cold gaze
00:27:52 and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours
00:27:54 and maybe you can even sense
00:27:56 our lifestyles are probably comparable
00:27:58 I simply am not
00:28:00 there
00:28:02 I fucking love that movie
00:28:04 I watched it again like two days ago
00:28:06 American Psycho is the greatest movie
00:28:08 I literally idolized Patrick Babin
00:28:10 he is my hero in every aspect
00:28:12 I don't know
00:28:14 I don't agree because I feel manipulated by you right now
00:28:16 well that is an emotional response
00:28:18 and I would urge you to crush those feelings
00:28:20 I feel really manipulated
00:28:22 by your speech there to laugh
00:28:24 you literally are
00:28:26 you literally have been manipulated
00:28:28 that's right that's exactly right
00:28:30 I'm being manipulated by everyone around me
00:28:32 that's how it is
00:28:34 look I'm sorry that
00:28:36 I phrase things differently than most people
00:28:38 but that is how it is
00:28:40 that is how it is in real life
00:28:42 okay okay
00:28:44 I can understand using the word manipulation
00:28:46 I can get behind just like you know
00:28:48 it being a word meaning change
00:28:50 but how is it deceit
00:28:52 how are you deceiving me
00:28:54 well I guess the only way
00:28:56 to argue that is deceit is to not do it
00:28:58 because like it was just
00:29:00 something that you wanted to do
00:29:02 but to do it specifically to achieve an intended outcome
00:29:04 I guess is the difference there
00:29:06 let me look up what the word deceit means
00:29:08 but even that's like not bad
00:29:10 there must be some lying here
00:29:12 I don't even think there's a distinction because like
00:29:14 why is it morally better to do stuff just because you want to
00:29:16 as opposed to achieve a certain outcome
00:29:18 there is no moral distinction there in my mind
00:29:20 I don't think so either
00:29:22 that's not what I'm saying
00:29:24 okay deceit
00:29:26 it's actually a practice of deceiving some
00:29:28 okay this uses the word deceiving hold on
00:29:30 well that's a fucked up definition
00:29:32 fucking
00:29:34 I continue talking while I find this
00:29:36 well you know what I honestly don't care about any of this
00:29:38 I wanted to get my American psycho joke in and I did it
00:29:40 so we can
00:29:42 I'm just saying that
00:29:44 doing things because you want to
00:29:46 in like and
00:29:48 doing something that you want to
00:29:50 that is not against laws
00:29:52 or against social convention
00:29:54 no reason to frame it as a trick
00:29:56 or like you are doing
00:29:58 something wrong
00:30:00 like like like deceiving people
00:30:02 okay yeah the implication
00:30:04 is that it's like
00:30:06 it's like abnormal and like not human
00:30:08 it's the thing humans would not do otherwise
00:30:10 I have a
00:30:12 I have a thought about this what if
00:30:14 you know
00:30:16 that like I don't know tell let's say telling
00:30:18 jokes like let's say you know
00:30:20 that like going out in public and telling jokes
00:30:22 gets a good reaction and people like it
00:30:24 you are not naturally
00:30:26 inclined to tell jokes
00:30:28 but you learn that like oh people
00:30:30 really like it when I tell jokes so I'm going to go out
00:30:32 to a party I'm going to tell jokes be the life of the party
00:30:34 everyone really likes it
00:30:36 is that is that deceitful
00:30:38 for you to go out and do that
00:30:40 because you know that it's
00:30:42 what people want even if it's not like what you were
00:30:44 quote unquote naturally inclined to do
00:30:46 an excellent question Ben
00:30:48 and it reminds me of the exact
00:30:50 same thing can be applied to like
00:30:52 I mean when people hear about like for example
00:30:54 pickup artists for just people
00:30:56 who go out and really try
00:30:58 to like meet women and like entertain them
00:31:00 and completely consensually like
00:31:02 get them to sleep with them by being fun
00:31:04 and entertaining yeah people have a reaction
00:31:06 to that like something bad is happening
00:31:08 there yeah but literally
00:31:10 what is the issue and it's exactly what you just said
00:31:12 like the whole that making people laugh to make people like
00:31:14 you it is the exact same thing
00:31:16 and I would argue that there is no
00:31:18 like I don't know why anyone would even say
00:31:20 that there's a problem with such a thing
00:31:22 I would argue that those people are better
00:31:24 than the people who are naturally inclined
00:31:26 I think it would be a little fucked up
00:31:28 I don't know
00:31:30 I mean this person who's
00:31:32 going out and telling jokes
00:31:34 I mean are they tricking you
00:31:36 like is by acting a certain way
00:31:38 that they have like made themselves act
00:31:40 because they know people like it is that a trick
00:31:42 because it's not like because they didn't use
00:31:44 to do that or because they didn't
00:31:46 because they're only doing it to get
00:31:48 a specific outcome
00:31:50 what is not a trick
00:31:52 is there anything in the world that is not a trick
00:31:54 the reason we got
00:31:56 onto this like line of thinking is that we were
00:31:58 trying to determine if being nice
00:32:00 is a bad thing or not and if
00:32:02 this all if all of this stuff that we're doing
00:32:04 is like manipulating and deceiving
00:32:06 but it's also totally normal and everyone
00:32:08 does it is not bad
00:32:10 what are we talking about
00:32:12 we're just kind of
00:32:14 why is nice is bad
00:32:16 nice is bad because it's what cucks do
00:32:18 that's why that's why just don't get cuck
00:32:20 look at this guy saying the cuck
00:32:22 well don't people
00:32:24 don't people like nice people
00:32:26 they like to use them
00:32:28 this is off topic
00:32:30 this is off topic but going slightly back to
00:32:32 pick up artists I completely agree with you Nate
00:32:34 like the way you've described pick up artists
00:32:36 it is indeed like who could fault that
00:32:38 just people being nice
00:32:40 and consensually having sex with women
00:32:42 or you know men whatever
00:32:44 like there's any such thing
00:32:46 I feel like
00:32:48 what's the
00:32:50 I feel like pick up artists go
00:32:52 have the same problem that I guess
00:32:54 this is kind of not related
00:32:56 but like feminists have where it's like
00:32:58 sure like the core ideal of like
00:33:00 I want women to be equal
00:33:02 sure who can agree with that but in
00:33:04 practice who can agree with that not
00:33:06 fuck yeah
00:33:08 that's true don't take that out
00:33:10 amplify that
00:33:12 do
00:33:14 but it's just like sure
00:33:16 these ideals if you want to define those groups of that
00:33:18 like who like that's just a good
00:33:20 thing people want that
00:33:22 but in practice a lot of people
00:33:24 that's not all people think about
00:33:26 when they hear the term pick up artists or
00:33:28 feminists they think of all of the pick up
00:33:30 artists or feminists that they've seen who are not nice
00:33:32 people even pick up artists
00:33:34 that I rather like like there's this one guy
00:33:36 who calls himself Tyler Durden
00:33:38 or Tyler RSD after the guy from
00:33:40 fucking Fight Club like even
00:33:42 he well you know what honestly
00:33:44 it might not have actually been him so take his name out of it maybe
00:33:46 he's in a relay but I have heard some pick up guys
00:33:48 who like promote the stuff or like teach
00:33:50 it say like that it's okay to like
00:33:52 lie about like who you are
00:33:54 and like I get the argument there because
00:33:56 like you're just like ooh it's all fun like crazy
00:33:58 night out and you're just giving like a fun experience
00:34:00 to people but that's always kind of rub me
00:34:02 the wrong way and I don't like
00:34:04 that stuff so again all that
00:34:06 stuff like you're absolutely right labels
00:34:08 are bad fuck the labels I'm just
00:34:10 I'm using it a shorthand which is unfortunate
00:34:12 because it will give these kind of you know connotations
00:34:14 I was having our say about this the other day
00:34:16 we're like like I
00:34:18 again it's all about labels and
00:34:20 when you say like you know
00:34:22 you just want to go out and have sex which is fine
00:34:24 not a bad thing that's fine
00:34:26 but there is obviously a pick up artist culture
00:34:28 and I don't I don't know that
00:34:30 culture like backhand I don't
00:34:32 really know what's going on I've seen
00:34:34 movies or pick up artists or like bad people and I know
00:34:36 Nate who you know who's a bad person
00:34:38 it was a nice person no it's a nice person
00:34:40 so yeah you know I don't
00:34:42 really know what the fuck's going on I'm just saying that like I don't
00:34:44 think it's unreasonable that people have a semi
00:34:46 bad interpretation of pick up artists
00:34:48 people can have based on the fact of
00:34:50 what I know about the culture which is limited
00:34:52 I mean I mean there's there's good ones
00:34:54 and bad ones and you know
00:34:56 your your opinion of the whole thing is
00:34:58 going to be like which you've had experience
00:35:00 with I don't even consider
00:35:02 myself really relate to the community I just
00:35:04 I was there and learn
00:35:06 some stuff and then you know like
00:35:08 moved on with my life because I hate labels
00:35:10 anyway um but anyway
00:35:12 let's get the fuck out of here let's
00:35:14 let's get back to why
00:35:16 why nice is tell me
00:35:18 why niceness is good what's there to like
00:35:20 there's nothing people like it like if
00:35:22 okay here's an argument if people
00:35:24 think that you are nice
00:35:26 then they will like you more and
00:35:28 and they will probably seek
00:35:30 out your company more yes
00:35:32 and that's pretty great
00:35:34 universal some people like think I
00:35:36 he's just nice I want to fucking
00:35:38 freak
00:35:40 freak some people
00:35:42 like the streets
00:35:44 that's kind of me that's kind of me
00:35:46 yeah yeah I feel that
00:35:48 but like like it can be kind of boring
00:35:50 but it is just nice if you know
00:35:52 if you know that someone is
00:35:54 is cool but like in person
00:35:56 say there's like an internet person
00:35:58 and they're like wacky and edgy and cool
00:36:00 and stuff well here's one but in
00:36:02 person they're like it then
00:36:04 nice to hang out with and they're not like abrasive
00:36:06 and shouting at you all the time
00:36:08 I mean I'm not I'm not really trying to show this
00:36:10 the obvious is more complicated this but like Joseph
00:36:12 Anderson making all his like millions of long
00:36:14 ass videos about video games
00:36:16 like they're all like just very similar like synopsis
00:36:18 and they go over shit and if he likes
00:36:20 or doesn't like it or whatever but then you got
00:36:22 Matthew Matosis who they you know they say that
00:36:24 like Joseph Anderson is like Matthew Matosis
00:36:26 2.0 but then he's like bargain
00:36:28 Matthew Matosis well that's what I'm saying
00:36:30 because he comes up with the Sonic Dreams
00:36:32 collection video that's like what the fuck
00:36:34 is this Jesus Christ yeah and like that's
00:36:36 like the coolest video ever that's got so
00:36:38 much more personality and it's like you know
00:36:40 who this guy is because he's playing this
00:36:42 kind of game I think about
00:36:44 I think about Joseph Anderson Matthew Matosis
00:36:46 all the time and how and how obsessed
00:36:48 and how obsessed maybe
00:36:50 yeah it's weird it's weird how much I think
00:36:52 about it like how I'll take
00:36:54 a Joseph Anderson video and I'll be like
00:36:56 okay well this kid this is slaked my lust
00:36:58 for the time being but but like
00:37:00 it doesn't it doesn't give me that deep
00:37:02 soul satisfaction that Matthew
00:37:04 Matosis stuff
00:37:06 you need your fix you just need your fix
00:37:08 really long video game analysis
00:37:10 they are good
00:37:12 where does where does Noah
00:37:14 Caldwell lie on this?
00:37:16 Noah Caldwell is like
00:37:18 God it's like
00:37:20 where was the angry Leo Game Nerd
00:37:22 Noah Caldwell he's like
00:37:24 is he worse?
00:37:26 it's like if you want a version of Matthew Matosis
00:37:28 or Joseph Anderson who doesn't
00:37:30 make any sense
00:37:32 okay
00:37:34 Noah will just he'll just go off about like
00:37:36 I don't know I actually listen to like his travel blogs
00:37:38 the other day I listened for like four hours
00:37:40 just him talking about like driving up the west coast
00:37:42 I was like uh yeah
00:37:44 is Noah Caldwell Gervais a nice guy?
00:37:46 is he a nice person? Absolutely
00:37:48 I mean I can tell he looks
00:37:50 he looks like he's uh on the
00:37:52 soylent diet
00:37:54 I got no hatred for the guy
00:37:56 he seems fine he's a big boy
00:37:58 he's a large man he could crush me
00:38:00 I'm thinking of like in terms of at a party
00:38:02 if someone you know you're just talking to people
00:38:04 and somebody is just sort of like
00:38:06 they're kind of boring but they're
00:38:08 polite I think when you think
00:38:10 of like the person who was not abrasive
00:38:12 but was also boring you think of them as
00:38:14 the nice person and you forget about them
00:38:16 but if somebody is like
00:38:18 they're really interesting and they're also polite
00:38:20 you think oh that guy's a great guy
00:38:22 it's just a different word people use
00:38:24 they say great instead of nice even though
00:38:26 the level of politeness the level of like
00:38:28 um what do you call it
00:38:30 manners or something like
00:38:32 there's the same amount of stuff it's really just
00:38:34 uh like
00:38:36 added on to what sort of person they are
00:38:38 and how cool they are if they're you know
00:38:40 a polite person who is cool
00:38:42 they're great and if they're a polite person
00:38:44 who is not cool they're nice
00:38:46 I have an anecdote that I would like to say
00:38:48 from my real life
00:38:50 where okay okay as I'm sure
00:38:52 even the audience knows I hang around
00:38:54 mostly freaks and geeks and assholes
00:38:56 I'm in the PCP
00:38:58 I hang around mostly
00:39:00 who are her sardonic or sarcastic
00:39:02 and who are you know vaguely edgy
00:39:04 and it's great that's the kind of
00:39:06 people who I want to be around I like
00:39:08 uh biting comedy
00:39:10 I like biting people I like
00:39:12 to consume flash
00:39:14 yeah exactly
00:39:16 yeah right
00:39:18 feed me chocolate yummy
00:39:22 um but there's this one person
00:39:24 who I know in real life who is the exact opposite
00:39:26 of this he's just a nice
00:39:28 wholesome kid
00:39:30 and I don't think
00:39:32 he's my best friend I don't think
00:39:34 like like we like
00:39:36 we uh we're just we're just sort of
00:39:38 uh good friends
00:39:40 and I'll go to him sometimes and
00:39:42 he'll be talking about how he likes like you know
00:39:44 the newest Marvel movie and you know
00:39:46 all that kind of shit
00:39:48 I'll be non-long like yeah sure
00:39:50 it's just a lot of saccharine stuff
00:39:52 but it's nice he is a nice person
00:39:54 and I need that refreshness in my life
00:39:56 so I can better you know
00:39:58 accustom with the word better appreciate
00:40:00 uh the biting uh
00:40:02 sarcasm and irony and
00:40:04 uh insincerity of uh
00:40:06 my time here on the internet
00:40:08 so it's nice to have people in your life
00:40:10 just genuine people you can just
00:40:12 rely on to uh you know
00:40:14 bring some life back in your life
00:40:16 are you talking about your Mewtwo?
00:40:18 yes I'm talking about my Mewtwo
00:40:20 thank you Hippo
00:40:22 my Mewtwo
00:40:24 from Pokemon Go, thank you
00:40:26 I would like
00:40:28 like I know that
00:40:30 we in the PCP are like
00:40:32 edgy and stuff but I feel like
00:40:34 we are nice in the in the sense that we know
00:40:36 each other well enough that we will not
00:40:38 cross lines we will be like
00:40:40 sarcastic but all of us can take that level
00:40:42 of sarcasm and we all know how much
00:40:44 you know everyone can take sure
00:40:46 so like we know each other we will be like
00:40:48 uh you know joking
00:40:50 around like insulting each other
00:40:52 and it's not like fake completely
00:40:54 but it's like at a level that you know
00:40:56 all of us can can understand
00:40:58 that it's not really like a
00:41:00 like a like a spiteful sort of like
00:41:02 actual attack and
00:41:04 and that's what I still feel
00:41:06 of that as being nice
00:41:08 because it's like it's just being friendly
00:41:10 and chummy and it's like technically
00:41:12 you put that the same words
00:41:14 in a different in a different
00:41:16 context it would be like horrible but like
00:41:18 because we're okay with it it's
00:41:20 nice and it's normal we talked about this a little bit
00:41:22 in the friendship episode the the the one we did
00:41:24 at Radcon and like
00:41:26 I think this comes up sometimes
00:41:28 and I again I do think we have a slightly
00:41:30 different perspective on it even
00:41:32 within our group whereas like I don't
00:41:34 really see I think
00:41:36 there's two things going on when you're like in a friendship
00:41:38 you want to be generally pleasant because like
00:41:40 you don't want to be you know overly
00:41:42 rough on like your friends and like make them
00:41:44 make like like their experience of hanging out with you
00:41:46 like just generally negative obviously
00:41:48 you don't want to do that but like at the same time
00:41:50 you don't want to like like
00:41:52 I feel like the people in your life
00:41:54 who can really like challenge you
00:41:56 that you will actually like listen to
00:41:58 and like respect their opinions of for
00:42:00 me it's mostly my friends
00:42:02 like I expect my friends to be the ones
00:42:04 to like because like the person you're dating
00:42:06 like again not to be rude or
00:42:08 anything it's just like when you're dating someone
00:42:10 they've got an incentive to like not piss you off
00:42:12 and like make sure everything's going smooth
00:42:14 and I don't really trust their opinion on
00:42:16 anything
00:42:18 I don't know if they're inherent qualities
00:42:20 and you seem to be like they are
00:42:22 they are just part of the relationship
00:42:24 I think they will
00:42:26 exist inherently to various degrees
00:42:28 I do think they are basically inherent
00:42:30 maybe some people can squash them and make them really really tiny
00:42:32 but there's always going to be
00:42:34 an incentive to just like be nice
00:42:36 to for example the person you're dating
00:42:38 but that's in any relationship right
00:42:40 yeah it's with friendships as well
00:42:42 like we have incentive to not like ruin
00:42:44 our friendships because
00:42:46 then we wouldn't have any friends
00:42:48 you're not wrong God knows I don't tell all the criticisms
00:42:50 to you guys that I could
00:42:52 like if we were like
00:42:54 super critical at each other all the time
00:42:56 we would all be econ and it would be
00:42:58 even more
00:43:00 I guess I would just argue that with friends
00:43:02 I feel I find it's like a little easier
00:43:04 to be more like roughly honest
00:43:06 with like with them as opposed to like
00:43:08 the person you're dating
00:43:10 I don't think that's necessarily a reflection of all relationships
00:43:12 well obviously it's not going to be
00:43:14 literally all I'm talking about a general trend here
00:43:16 but okay whatever doesn't matter
00:43:18 for me personally
00:43:20 I just want to say I don't know econ
00:43:22 I just hear things I don't hate him
00:43:24 shout out to econ
00:43:26 I still haven't gone on my hot sauce
00:43:28 which is fine
00:43:30 who? okay moving on
00:43:32 literally who
00:43:36 I don't know I pretty much said
00:43:38 all I wanted to say on this particular subject I think
00:43:40 I think people get where I'm coming from
00:43:42 like I come at this whole thing from the idea of like
00:43:44 I see like being nice
00:43:46 as like
00:43:48 a boring trait
00:43:50 that is like some it's
00:43:52 being nice is nice once you're already
00:43:54 like in a relationship and like you already
00:43:56 know people but like niceness
00:43:58 doesn't like grab attention it doesn't make you
00:44:00 stand out it doesn't really help
00:44:02 you achieve major steps
00:44:04 forward in your life but I don't think it's
00:44:06 sustaining but I don't think it hurts anything
00:44:10 it's not a large positive factor
00:44:12 but it is indeed a positive factor
00:44:14 you enjoy
00:44:16 well not you
00:44:18 you but like you know the general populist
00:44:20 would probably enjoy someone who is nice
00:44:22 to someone who is not nice
00:44:24 in most cases
00:44:26 the real thing is like getting a balance between
00:44:28 being nice and being real
00:44:30 if somebody is nice all the time
00:44:32 to the point where you can't tell when they're
00:44:34 actually being sincere about their niceness
00:44:36 well isn't that interesting
00:44:38 you can be critical and still be nice
00:44:40 and you are not nice
00:44:42 well it's true but like say somebody is like
00:44:44 saying oh my videos suck
00:44:46 and then somebody goes up to them saying
00:44:48 no they're not but in reality they actually
00:44:50 it's the interesting thing you're setting a dichotomy between
00:44:52 like honesty and niceness
00:44:54 which is kind of I mean I guess there's just
00:44:56 like raw realness
00:44:58 like here's my one like
00:45:00 black pill thing that I had
00:45:02 in my brain
00:45:04 is that um
00:45:06 I almost forgot it
00:45:08 oh I did forget it
00:45:10 dark dark souls
00:45:12 you went hollow
00:45:14 is this podcast the dark souls of the bcp
00:45:16 it is
00:45:18 it really is
00:45:20 I'll think of it
00:45:22 to record and I'm sure to listen to
00:45:24 yeah really
00:45:26 oh yeah yeah I got it
00:45:28 being nice sometimes is just
00:45:30 cowardly because
00:45:32 you want
00:45:34 if somebody is upset
00:45:36 or like they are like
00:45:38 potentially going to be upset if you get too real
00:45:40 with them and you are not nice to them
00:45:42 either by
00:45:44 not saying anything or being nice
00:45:46 to sort of like placate them
00:45:48 is cowardly because all you're doing
00:45:50 is preventing yourself
00:45:52 from being upset that they are upset
00:45:54 that's right totally true
00:45:56 I'm not proposing
00:45:58 that you have to be nice 100%
00:46:00 of the time I never have
00:46:02 and I even
00:46:04 there are a lot of cases where being nice is a completely terrible idea
00:46:06 again to like placate your friends
00:46:08 make them just feel that they are secure
00:46:10 and bad things you know
00:46:12 like if their videos suck you should probably tell them
00:46:14 but there are different ways
00:46:16 to go about that and I feel like this word nice just comes through
00:46:18 you can say hey your
00:46:20 views suck now lol
00:46:22 wins rayman 2
00:46:24 as I've heard
00:46:26 every day
00:46:28 your friend
00:46:30 disgasher but great to deal with that dude
00:46:32 you know munchie
00:46:34 or you just be like hey I noticed your videos are like this lately
00:46:36 can we please get some more
00:46:38 magenta filters
00:46:40 I think that really helped
00:46:42 you know what I'm happy to concede munchie
00:46:44 that I come into this thing
00:46:46 extremely biased just
00:46:48 against the word nice
00:46:50 it's like it's my daemon
00:46:52 it is my daemon that I grew up with
00:46:54 and now I just despise it across the board
00:46:56 but really the right way
00:46:58 my daemon
00:47:00 this is the same old english
00:47:02 like amber spyglass
00:47:04 yeah that's right
00:47:06 my british daemon daemon
00:47:08 that's what it is
00:47:10 no daemons are weird
00:47:12 only the
00:47:14 suck
00:47:16 your bus
00:47:18 I just want to talk about my favorite works
00:47:20 of young adult fiction guys
00:47:22 Percy Jackson
00:47:24 ok shut up
00:47:26 what I was going to say was
00:47:28 I am definitely wrong in that I am
00:47:30 way too black and white
00:47:32 take that clip right there
00:47:34 delete that from the podcast
00:47:36 I'm definitely way too
00:47:38 personally biased and the correct way to go
00:47:40 is exactly what you guys have been saying
00:47:42 with like your more nuanced interpretation
00:47:44 and like subjective and like
00:47:46 case by case basis usage of being nice
00:47:48 because it obviously makes sense a lot of the time
00:47:50 and I just kind of hate it
00:47:52 just in a biased emotional way
00:47:54 which is wrong
00:47:56 I'm definitely ready to give you some leeway here
00:47:58 because it was really eye opening
00:48:00 when we were talking about how like
00:48:02 with the french episode like about love
00:48:04 where definitions for
00:48:06 words have to be very exact
00:48:08 for you
00:48:10 which I don't think is really wrong
00:48:12 and a lot of words are really vague
00:48:14 and that is a problem
00:48:16 but I think that like you can usually
00:48:18 ascertain the general definition
00:48:20 of most things
00:48:22 I can't wait to do the language episode
00:48:24 because I utterly despise
00:48:26 that fuzziness that exists inherently
00:48:28 in the usage of these words
00:48:30 I hate it so much
00:48:32 I think it is probably the biggest problem
00:48:34 that we are of the modern age
00:48:36 but we'll talk about that later on
00:48:38 I would like to do the episode
00:48:40 that sounds nice
00:48:42 nice is nice
00:48:44 debunked, niceness debunked
00:48:46 God, removed from real life

00:50:08 who know shit about percy jackson
00:50:10 excellent okay done
00:50:12 moving on everybody it's time to go
00:50:14 to those beloved questions
00:50:16 that we all love so much
00:50:18 hey everybody
00:50:20 patreon.com slash the procrastinators
00:50:22 give us your money
00:50:24 get into the patron lounge
00:50:26 from twitter so we can get that out of the way
00:50:28 we can wipe that shit off our shoe
00:50:30 we can move on to the galaxy
00:50:32 that is the questions bar
00:50:34 here's a pretty good
00:50:36 I don't know if I've ever read this one before
00:50:38 there's a bunch of questions about radcon
00:50:40 things like will you do radcon again
00:50:42 radcon 4
00:50:44 radcon 2 electric boogaloo the fourth one
00:50:46 these cowards
00:50:48 how dare they appreciate radcon
00:50:50 who do they think they are
00:50:52 they're trying to trick us into thinking
00:50:54 that they like radcon
00:50:56 what the fuck
00:50:58 yeah how dare they
00:51:00 impede
00:51:02 impose their emotional
00:51:04 likes and dislikes
00:51:06 and let us know how they feel about the content
00:51:08 that we have generated for them
00:51:10 so as to guide our production
00:51:12 of future content that is
00:51:14 evil and that is core
00:51:16 I wonder why people think
00:51:18 this was the last one
00:51:20 did anyone I didn't see that
00:51:22 will there be another one
00:51:24 why is that even a question
00:51:26 maybe just because it took so long
00:51:28 for this one to happen
00:51:30 we did spend
00:51:32 man it was like a whole year
00:51:34 because radcon 1 happened and 3 or 4 months later
00:51:36 radcon 2 happens
00:51:38 it's weird to think about that now
00:51:40 it is weird
00:51:42 it's really just because we wanted to do it immediately
00:51:44 and we started it
00:51:46 the first one did not have a kickstarter
00:51:48 the second one did
00:51:50 put 2 kickstarters really close to each other
00:51:52 it's because did you and Jesse just were doing
00:51:54 their kickstarter and then that just got turned into
00:51:56 radcon 2 so it was like a big
00:51:58 we didn't plan that one it just kind of happened
00:52:00 on its face
00:52:02 but we are definitely going to work to make these happen
00:52:04 certainly more often than they have
00:52:06 I think the ideal
00:52:08 audience don't take this as fact
00:52:10 just the ideal thing that I think we all
00:52:12 would like to go for is like every 6 months or so
00:52:14 though that's probably unrealistic
00:52:16 I think that's a good middle ground
00:52:20 I'd sure like that if we could do that
00:52:22 and hey maybe if radcon hq happens
00:52:24 I mean pcphq happens
00:52:26 that certainly changed things
00:52:28 who knows how often we'd do it
00:52:30 I like it to be a special thing
00:52:32 it's radcon every day bro
00:52:34 yeah
00:52:36 hey but there's one other question
00:52:38 I wanted to read on here
00:52:40 this will be the actual real question
00:52:42 from the peeps on the twitter
00:52:44 at cultoftheyellow1 asks
00:52:46 Nate if you had a behelit
00:52:48 would you use that shit to sacrifice the other
00:52:50 pcp members to transcend your humanity
00:52:52 of course you would
00:52:54 here's the real answer it would be
00:52:56 morally bankrupt of me not to do it
00:52:58 I have to do it
00:53:00 because your lives are objectively less valuable
00:53:02 than the good I do
00:53:04 I don't blame you I would do the exact same thing
00:53:06 in a heartbeat
00:53:08 well thank you man
00:53:10 the one problem
00:53:12 it's a thing from berserk
00:53:14 basically a guy uses it
00:53:16 destroys his friends
00:53:18 and gains ultimate power
00:53:20 but see that's the problem right there
00:53:22 the behelit chooses the things that you care about most
00:53:24 in life and therefore the pcp is going to be
00:53:26 fine you guys won't be hurt at all
00:53:28 dab dab dab
00:53:30 fucking destroy
00:53:32 that's good for me
00:53:34 are you saying that the behelit just wouldn't
00:53:36 oh wait you don't even like it
00:53:38 that's what I'm saying
00:53:40 but Nate this means that the behelit
00:53:42 will stop
00:53:44 starfleet from ever happening
00:53:46 nooo
00:53:48 I don't know how
00:53:50 I think the behelit would like make starfleet
00:53:52 happen but kill like the problem is though
00:53:54 I'm so blackpilled I don't care about nothing man
00:53:56 I don't care about nothing who can even take
00:53:58 only a true cynic can wield the behelit
00:54:00 it would just take your sunglasses
00:54:02 nooo
00:54:04 you could never wear sunglasses you'd live forever
00:54:06 but you could never wear sunglasses again
00:54:08 that would be devastating and action giraffe would die
00:54:10 no fuck
00:54:12 the camino would be erased from existence
00:54:14 if I had
00:54:16 the ballet t.a
00:54:18 I would wish for all the chocolate
00:54:20 in the world
00:54:22 I'm so hungry
00:54:24 feed me yummy snacks
00:54:26 um excellent
00:54:28 I like this new character munchy
00:54:30 I'm so hungry
00:54:32 I only need the yummiest
00:54:34 of foods
00:54:36 good well let's go to the fucking patrons
00:54:38 now let's go to the real shit now
00:54:40 oh that out of the way
00:54:42 okay what do we got
00:54:44 read me feed me chocolate
00:54:46 questions from the patron lounge
00:54:48 from the patron lounge
00:54:50 Cicero do you guys think
00:54:52 competition like like cap like
00:54:54 proper noun competition is a good
00:54:56 or bad thing
00:54:58 lay does it help you improve faster
00:55:00 is it handling your improvement and creativity
00:55:02 competition is always good
00:55:04 competition is great
00:55:06 read bakuman
00:55:08 well yeah it's not always good
00:55:10 it's like very good
00:55:12 in the worst case scenario
00:55:14 competition that is like too steep
00:55:16 can make you discouraged because you're like well I'm never
00:55:18 gonna be as good as these guys
00:55:20 yeah uneven competition
00:55:22 is usually bad but like
00:55:24 if you're in an even playing field
00:55:26 well okay it depends on what he means
00:55:28 like does it mean like literal like trophies
00:55:30 like this is a professional sports competition
00:55:32 or does he just mean like
00:55:34 rivalrys between friends to see who can
00:55:36 I mean it sounds like in the case of us
00:55:38 he means like just for example like the
00:55:40 quote-unquote rival between
00:55:42 competition because like
00:55:44 like capitalism depends on you know
00:55:46 you know what kind of competition would really
00:55:48 improve my life as if patreon had some
00:55:50 fucking competition damn right what same with
00:55:52 YouTube same with okay I was just thinking about
00:55:54 this like Michelle has YouTube
00:55:56 read and like how
00:55:58 many millions of times is everyone said like
00:56:00 God I wish I could like close my phone
00:56:02 and still have YouTube play so I could like
00:56:04 save the battery life and stuff like that
00:56:06 function already exists and it's only
00:56:08 for YouTube red people
00:56:10 so like you so you have to pay money
00:56:12 for it but so like the reason competition
00:56:14 is good like we need a YouTube competitor so that
00:56:16 there's another app that does the exact same thing as
00:56:18 YouTube so that like they that other
00:56:20 company can give away that service for free
00:56:22 so that YouTube is pressured to make it
00:56:24 available to everyone that is how we get better
00:56:26 stuff through competition forcing
00:56:28 like the market to evolve and like
00:56:30 you know all these things get cheaper and more accessible
00:56:32 and they have to innovate and stuff
00:56:34 already yeah YouTube
00:56:36 I mean definitely that would help
00:56:38 YouTube get better quicker
00:56:40 I'm sure that they really
00:56:42 want to try and find ways to make
00:56:44 this everything they do
00:56:46 much cheaper to
00:56:48 to do because I have how expensive it is
00:56:50 to host video so like
00:56:52 I don't think I'm gonna stop until they're actually
00:56:54 making like big money and then they can just
00:56:56 rest on their laurels I mean
00:56:58 but if they had competition I mean
00:57:00 it would be good definitely
00:57:02 the specific kind of like feature stuff
00:57:04 like everyone wants this YouTube red feature
00:57:06 and I really think the reason why it's
00:57:08 not available to the public that it's like gated
00:57:10 behind stuff is because no one is
00:57:12 offering that service at like a lower
00:57:14 price or or even for free
00:57:16 and like the reason that like smart
00:57:18 phones are like now accessible is because
00:57:20 like everybody started making smart phones and it
00:57:22 has driven the price down so now it's like affordable
00:57:24 for the average person and stuff
00:57:26 otherwise you'd have like one if only one
00:57:28 company like owned like smart phone
00:57:30 technology like they could just
00:57:32 you know price that should up crazy high
00:57:34 however they wanted to and everyone would want it
00:57:36 but it's cuz you know we've got the competition
00:57:38 to one like fucking iPhones and the androids
00:57:40 and stuff you already kind of got that with
00:57:42 iPhones like well yeah
00:57:44 just live one like
00:57:46 if they're an iPhone they will never even
00:57:48 think about getting an Android
00:57:50 true true they will pay
00:57:52 all the money because like
00:57:54 yeah I mean it is a slightly different service
00:57:56 like iPhones just like work automatically
00:57:58 and they don't take the kind of like they kind of lock
00:58:00 shit down so you can't fuck it up which decreases
00:58:02 freedom for people who like want to mess with their
00:58:04 phones and stuff but I mean whatever you
00:58:06 get the idea but for competition like among
00:58:08 us as like creators I think it's generally
00:58:10 good cuz I mean all the time I'm always
00:58:12 thinking of like I kind of in my mind always
00:58:14 have like a milestone I'm trying to reach
00:58:16 and some of it is like people who had like
00:58:18 it should be nice to like pass that guy
00:58:20 hey I'm not just gonna say
00:58:22 I think I have just passed or I'm about
00:58:24 to pass a Digi brony after dark
00:58:26 that's like a milestone in my mind
00:58:28 you know you know so shout out to my boy
00:58:31 Digi
00:58:32 how many subscribers does Jeb Bush have?
00:58:36 cuz that's my goal is to always be under Jeb Bush
00:58:38 how many how many electoral
00:58:40 college votes are there that many
00:58:42 he got them all baby he got them all
00:58:46 my milestone right now is to get more than
00:58:48 10,000 views on a video that I post
00:58:50 you've done that though
00:58:52 I haven't thought about
00:58:54 I haven't thought about my YouTube in a
00:58:56 while but I am like creeping up to
00:58:58 10k I could probably hit 10k
00:59:00 without that much trouble if I like put my
00:59:02 mind to it
00:59:04 dude any with your fucking lecture coming
00:59:06 I think your fucking lecture coming
00:59:08 I think that's uh
00:59:10 oh you know what the lecture is gonna
00:59:12 yeah the lecture is gonna blow that shit out of the water
00:59:14 now Ben will be above me
00:59:16 but I have a couple of video things that I
00:59:18 have kind of been meaning to do at some point
00:59:20 and like I could
00:59:22 I could just do those
00:59:24 maybe after the lecture comes out and I could start getting
00:59:26 more hits I'll like put out
00:59:28 some more of that
00:59:30 yeah I bet I'll hit 10k when the lecture
00:59:32 comes out hell yeah
00:59:34 what are you at right now?
00:59:36 8 something? yeah okay
00:59:38 it's not unreasonable at all
00:59:40 it gets anywhere close to the views the other one got
00:59:42 uh no
00:59:44 am I subscribed to munchie?
00:59:46 I think I'm subscribed to in fact I know I am
00:59:48 subscribed to all y'all
00:59:50 I have 2k please
00:59:52 unsubscribe so I can go back to having no
00:59:54 k
00:59:56 alright another question
00:59:58 there are a lot of good questions in the questions
01:00:00 bar oh like this one uh chirpsky
01:00:02 is moving castle favorite anime
01:00:04 favorite anime oh my god
01:00:06 chirpsky no
01:00:08 stop it's got a bunch
01:00:10 of reaction emojis with just the word shit
01:00:12 reaction to that oh there you go
01:00:14 you see the people know the people know
01:00:16 but most of them I do not
01:00:18 have a good answer for
01:00:20 mozoelofinnikid
01:00:22 what is something you could never forgive someone for
01:00:24 making
01:00:26 asking that question in the patron lounge
01:00:28 that's a good question
01:00:30 no this is a good question a previous one
01:00:32 um
01:00:34 asking favorite anime
01:00:36 there's obvious things like killing my family
01:00:38 like yeah but I'm trying to
01:00:40 think of like the least that I would
01:00:42 I could forgive that
01:00:44 it was just bad
01:00:46 I could never forgive someone
01:00:48 for something like
01:00:50 something like um
01:00:52 probably like
01:00:54 telling people what I've done
01:00:56 like like
01:00:58 ruining my reputation or something
01:01:00 yeah yeah yeah
01:01:02 or showing someone my youtube channel
01:01:04 at all
01:01:06 that's pretty high
01:01:08 that's pretty high uh just like
01:01:10 me
01:01:12 I
01:01:14 that's a doing weed I could never forgive you
01:01:16 for doing weed anyone
01:01:18 I'm not too far off from that pal
01:01:20 I'm not too far off from that
01:01:22 in real life
01:01:24 I believe you man if you do weed
01:01:26 my perception of you will always be
01:01:28 colored that is not a joke
01:01:30 colored green and we know
01:01:32 much too fond of the colors so
01:01:34 you know um
01:01:36 I'm trying to think I mean you know like
01:01:38 I'd be very deeply upset
01:01:40 possibly forever if someone like
01:01:42 like fucked with
01:01:44 my relationship in some way you know
01:01:46 like fucked my girl like that would
01:01:48 definitely upset me in a massive way
01:01:50 um you know that'd be
01:01:52 bad that'd be real bad and that's where
01:01:54 my mind goes first because I'm a deeply insecure man
01:01:56 about my my my sex life
01:01:58 and that's why I'm obsessed with it and have
01:02:00 deep rooted fears related to it all the time
01:02:02 uh so yeah you know
01:02:04 things relate to that yeah
01:02:06 I mean I feel like
01:02:08 that would be I feel like it would be
01:02:10 something like that it's just I haven't had
01:02:12 like one of those things
01:02:14 happened to me yet like I've
01:02:16 gotten mad at people and I've been like oh
01:02:18 you know what I'll never forgive you but then
01:02:20 I'm like it doesn't actually matter that much
01:02:22 yeah that's really I think that's really what it is though
01:02:24 like if I was dating someone and they really
01:02:26 like cheated on me and like a deeply humiliating
01:02:28 and fucked up way that would
01:02:30 definitely be one of the worst things I think
01:02:32 outside of like fucking like mutilating
01:02:34 me locking me in a sex dungeon and like
01:02:36 torturing me for the rest of my life like that'd be pretty bad
01:02:38 well are you saying you don't want to be in a sex dungeon
01:02:40 well let's say a non-sex dungeon
01:02:42 I'm allowed to know sex
01:02:44 now that's a nightmare
01:02:46 it's like like
01:02:48 prepare to be locked in a dungeon for the rest of your life
01:02:50 and tortured a sex dungeon
01:02:52 no no
01:02:54 yeah great
01:02:56 I feel like in a perfect world
01:02:58 in a perfect world
01:03:00 I would be able to forgive
01:03:02 really anything
01:03:04 I wouldn't like to forgive you
01:03:06 because a lot of the time
01:03:08 when you have like rage in you about a person
01:03:10 all it does is like make your own life
01:03:12 kind of annoying
01:03:14 whenever you think about that person you go
01:03:16 you twitch and you like
01:03:18 and you squeeze your hand like Arthur
01:03:20 I would rather
01:03:22 just be able to just think about it
01:03:24 fuck
01:03:26 yeah I'm with you Gib
01:03:28 I have a Buddhist saying about that
01:03:30 it's like
01:03:32 you're a foreign language class bin
01:03:34 it's like
01:03:36 no anger like holding on to anger
01:03:38 and like hoping for revenge
01:03:40 is like holding on to a hot coal
01:03:42 hoping that you will throw it at your enemy
01:03:44 you know
01:03:46 yeah that is good
01:03:48 but it hurts you in the meantime
01:03:50 I've got another excellent quote
01:03:52 fear leads to anger
01:03:54 anger leads to hate
01:03:56 hate leads to suffering
01:03:58 get out of here Yoda from the prequels
01:04:00 um
01:04:02 I don't like the prequels
01:04:04 they'll never forgive them
01:04:06 well said
01:04:08 here's something
01:04:10 if you watch Star Wars
01:04:12 do not try to be my friend
01:04:14 it will only lead to you
01:04:16 being six feet under the fucking ground
01:04:18 I feel the same way
01:04:20 Star Wars is not something
01:04:22 that I want to invite into my life
01:04:24 yeah agreed
01:04:26 agreed
01:04:28 here's the question I want to read
01:04:30 I've been wanting to comment on this
01:04:32 in some public way for a while now
01:04:34 Jalen Harris asks
01:04:36 who started the sunglasses meme
01:04:38 Nate or Digi
01:04:40 I'd be happy to hear your guys' opinions on this
01:04:42 but we all know the little man named keg standard
01:04:44 started a particular sunglasses meme
01:04:46 long before any of this shit began
01:04:48 and since the start
01:04:50 since the start of best guy ever
01:04:52 sunglasses have been a defining characteristic
01:04:54 of the channel
01:04:56 and I think that was before Digi ever started doing sunglasses things
01:04:58 I wish Digi was here to comment
01:05:00 I'd like to hear his opinion
01:05:02 did you request that keg have the shutter shades
01:05:04 or did I give him them
01:05:06 I don't remember
01:05:08 I think that might have been my
01:05:10 I think I might have gone and been like hey what if he had some shutter shades
01:05:12 I'm happy to give you credit
01:05:14 for coming up with some shutter shades
01:05:16 and
01:05:18 things were never the same
01:05:20 I really think that I came up with those
01:05:22 I really think that I suggested those
01:05:24 I was really into Kanye at the time
01:05:26 and I specifically said like Kanye shades
01:05:28 I'm not sure
01:05:30 I could believe that maybe you suggested it
01:05:32 but in either case
01:05:34 especially in their modern
01:05:36 incarnation of the PCP
01:05:38 even if that's true though
01:05:40 how far back does the Digi sunglasses meme go
01:05:42 because best guy ever
01:05:44 is immediately defined
01:05:46 by the sunglasses of the guy
01:05:48 that was right out of the gate
01:05:50 and I would say that was significantly before Digi started his sunglasses thing
01:05:52 I give myself full credit
01:05:54 when did Digi start the sunglasses
01:05:56 I don't even know
01:05:58 you know what
01:06:00 maybe Jesse
01:06:02 because he wore sunglasses in Tony videos
01:06:04 that's not a fine characteristic of Jesse
01:06:06 okay
01:06:08 you know what I hate
01:06:10 you know what I hate the fact that so many of you guys
01:06:12 wear sunglasses is that
01:06:14 it means that I can never wear them
01:06:16 because then I would be like oh you too
01:06:18 you as well
01:06:20 just a bunch of sunglasses dudes
01:06:22 okay but I will say that currently
01:06:24 I am the most consistent sunglasses guy
01:06:26 it's like my thing
01:06:28 it's like my thing now
01:06:30 Digi's thing too he's always turned off the sunglasses
01:06:32 Digi fucking stole it from me
01:06:34 a race trader
01:06:36 I'm inclined to
01:06:38 don't you fucking say it
01:06:40 I think you did say it
01:06:42 I think you did do it first
01:06:44 damn right
01:06:46 yeah fuck it die
01:06:48 there you go
01:06:50 and it's over
01:06:52 okay next question what do we got
01:06:54 O2Miraseu
01:06:56 what is the biggest missed opportunity at Radcon
01:06:58 not recording the fucking
01:07:00 clusterpunk fashion runway
01:07:02 I spent 140 dollars
01:07:04 on that shit
01:07:06 you were talking about it before
01:07:08 and the whole time and it just didn't happen
01:07:10 is it a missed
01:07:12 opportunity or is it like a fucked
01:07:14 opportunity because we
01:07:16 what do you mean
01:07:18 we just had too much stuff booked
01:07:20 we would have done it if we had the time
01:07:22 it's not like we forgot about it
01:07:24 real talk if we had schedule
01:07:26 we got a ton done we deserve like no criticism
01:07:28 for the amount of stuff that was produced at Radcon
01:07:30 but if we had worked better
01:07:32 we could have produced more stuff
01:07:34 it was on the fucking schedule
01:07:36 it was on the schedule
01:07:38 we didn't fucking stick to the schedule for shit
01:07:40 we tried
01:07:42 I made it in the hopes we'd stick to it but we did not
01:07:44 and you know like
01:07:46 I mean I was there to make sure I got my shit done
01:07:48 and I did you know it was
01:07:50 same I got the stuff that I needed
01:07:52 to get done the clusterpunk fashion runway
01:07:54 was supposed to be like a PCP thing but I
01:07:56 it would have been cool
01:07:58 you know what
01:08:00 put a fucking feather in that one
01:08:02 and save it because we could do it again
01:08:04 someday and you know what tbh
01:08:06 like because digi didn't know about it
01:08:08 like digi would have been the only person that could
01:08:10 have rivaled me I mean that is true
01:08:12 so like
01:08:14 it was sort of a fledgling idea that needed
01:08:16 a little bit more expanding and like
01:08:18 being like we're doing it now everyone signed up
01:08:20 I gotta get svelte
01:08:22 I gotta get svelte for next Radcon
01:08:24 so I can not look like a fucking fat piece of shit
01:08:26 on the clusterpunk fashion run
01:08:28 oh Jackie just got me okay Nate
01:08:30 you know about um you know my pink chucks
01:08:32 that are like
01:08:34 fucking faded shit and falling apart
01:08:36 he got me some new ones they are there neon
01:08:38 they are vibrant day glow pink chucks
01:08:40 and they are they are coming
01:08:42 on the on the fashion runway
01:08:44 I want this I want everyone
01:08:46 to like for radcon for everyone to bring
01:08:48 their fucking a game and bring the most
01:08:50 we'll see if you see I don't even know
01:08:52 I had to prepare anything I guess I just didn't consider
01:08:54 myself part of it
01:08:56 you don't have to be yeah I know I know
01:08:58 the only problem with me is that
01:09:00 suitcase space
01:09:02 like I just managed
01:09:04 to get everything that I brought to radcon
01:09:06 well you could bring a second suitcase
01:09:08 and check it we could budget for it
01:09:10 like full of stuff one outfit
01:09:12 it's I don't know
01:09:14 well would one outfit really take up that much space
01:09:16 in your suitcase I mean I don't know
01:09:18 I feel like these are solvable issues but
01:09:20 we can worry about that later
01:09:22 I have one
01:09:24 this was one for their history books
01:09:26 I am sad the one the only thing
01:09:28 I am personally really sad didn't
01:09:30 get made at radcon was I really wanted to do
01:09:32 otaku workouts with digi
01:09:34 I really wanted to do another workout video
01:09:36 which we did not I didn't know that was on the
01:09:38 docket like did you came up to me as like
01:09:40 Nate I wanted to blah blah blah all this stuff that I don't care
01:09:42 about but then he was like but otaku workouts
01:09:44 I'm like yeah that sounds fun
01:09:46 but we just did that time
01:09:48 okay not a missed opportunity
01:09:50 per se but kind of
01:09:52 is that I do regret not
01:09:54 being on art apologies
01:09:56 which I am greatly looking
01:09:58 forward to listening to
01:10:00 I wanted to be on that well after I saw
01:10:02 like the behind the scenes footage
01:10:04 of digi and also
01:10:06 like that behind the scenes
01:10:08 like clip of him like filming you
01:10:10 and Tom
01:10:12 like drawing your respective comics
01:10:14 just silently was really cool
01:10:16 oh by the way I should have been there
01:10:18 here's a little message to all the backers we have already
01:10:20 amassed a ton
01:10:22 a huge amount of backer content
01:10:24 it's unreal it's fucking unbelievable
01:10:26 we're talking like 20
01:10:28 videos already exist and one of them
01:10:30 was like 45 minutes
01:10:32 gib and digi killed it with the amount of
01:10:34 shit they made and there's more
01:10:36 I won't go into it
01:10:38 but we're not going to release it until more content
01:10:40 is out because it's got spoilers
01:10:42 I swear to god like 75%
01:10:44 of the entire time at
01:10:46 radcon like not having sleeping
01:10:48 was recorded like there was a camera on
01:10:50 somewhere in the house thanks to gib
01:10:52 thanks to gib and digi for like fucking filming
01:10:54 a bunch of shit there are two
01:10:56 other ones one of me and digi
01:10:58 were writing a skit for project
01:11:00 awesomeness that was great
01:11:02 and we just didn't have time to
01:11:04 record it properly and
01:11:06 and also this is not
01:11:08 really a missed opportunity because it didn't
01:11:10 fact happen but I'm kind of anxious
01:11:12 of the result been
01:11:14 the referee's cop killers me maker
01:11:16 was great but the actual like we sports
01:11:18 resort was really bad
01:11:20 yeah um
01:11:22 uh oh
01:11:24 it's okay
01:11:26 overall I liked it like I'm not
01:11:28 well the game was bad but I don't think
01:11:30 the the recording was bad
01:11:32 I think the record
01:11:34 I have an idea of how I want to fix it which will
01:11:36 really fit in with referee's cop killers but I'll
01:11:38 let you after the show so you don't
01:11:40 okay okay word fucked up
01:11:42 oh should we should we make it like a statement
01:11:44 on whether the stuff will be available
01:11:46 to people at some
01:11:48 point oh yeah we don't
01:11:50 have a plan for it but we plan on making it available
01:11:52 some way to people afterward so we will
01:11:54 get back to you if you didn't back radcon
01:11:56 do not panic even though you should feel ashamed of yourself
01:11:58 yeah but they're
01:12:00 probably will be a way to get it so don't
01:12:02 forget it'll be jacked the fuck
01:12:04 up though it'll be twisted you will
01:12:06 you will regret your decisions
01:12:08 sphincter directly
01:12:10 indeed indeed uh
01:12:12 says what future technology you must excited for
01:12:14 auto automatic cars
01:12:16 bro self drive cars auto
01:12:18 self erotic asphyxiation
01:12:20 looking forward to that in a big way
01:12:22 um self
01:12:24 self
01:12:26 fucking sex dolls
01:12:28 so basically
01:12:30 what is wrong with all of you
01:12:32 with all the fucking freaks
01:12:34 right now
01:12:36 you know having a sex doll is great but it's such a
01:12:38 time commitment but now you have a doll that will
01:12:40 fuck itself so you don't have to
01:12:44 I want aeroplanes
01:12:46 to become like incredibly
01:12:48 fuel efficient so that they're super cheap
01:12:50 and I can fly all over the world
01:12:52 yeah
01:12:54 that's fairly likely to happen
01:12:56 that's my new answer
01:12:58 okay
01:13:00 I didn't really care about living abroad at all
01:13:02 until like I just thought about it for a second
01:13:04 about how being in the EU
01:13:06 I could just like live in
01:13:08 like London or something like maybe not anymore
01:13:10 but I could like live in
01:13:12 like Paris or something
01:13:14 and I could just like walk
01:13:16 well not walk but I could just like go to Germany
01:13:18 or I could just like go to Spain
01:13:20 and then it's not gonna be very nice
01:13:22 I would like to do that
01:13:24 maybe not a radcon but just specifically
01:13:26 a Gibbon Munchie Hangout
01:13:28 I want to go to Europe someday
01:13:30 that will happen I guarantee it
01:13:32 we could pokemon go all over the world
01:13:34 hey man radcon 4 London
01:13:36 I'm just saying it would be pretty good
01:13:38 yes it would be pretty good and also very expensive
01:13:40 radcon 5 Japan
01:13:42 and radcon 5 Japan I love this idea
01:13:44 of doing the next one in London and the fifth one
01:13:46 in Japan in Tokyo
01:13:48 radcon Japan is the worst fucking idea I've ever
01:13:50 no you don't know that
01:13:52 you don't know shit how fucking sick would it be
01:13:54 I don't think radcon Japan would work
01:13:56 as a radcon I think it would work as a
01:13:58 let's all go to Japan and be anime
01:14:00 it would be so hard
01:14:02 don't speak Japanese
01:14:04 I have lived in Japan for months
01:14:06 and it is a place that is designed
01:14:08 that you don't need to know Japanese to survive
01:14:10 I have been there I know the place
01:14:12 most big cities you can ask for help
01:14:14 and people will speak
01:14:16 the reason it's kind of a weird idea
01:14:18 is because radcon is about
01:14:20 making content together
01:14:22 rather than hanging out in a city
01:14:24 well not every radcon has to be exactly the same
01:14:26 as long as we pitch it with the honest
01:14:28 this is what it's going to be
01:14:30 we would probably call London and Japan
01:14:32 different things than radcon then
01:14:34 no because radcon implies
01:14:36 like we're getting together to make a bunch of content
01:14:38 and you'll see it soon
01:14:40 but something like that would be
01:14:42 we go to an expensive city and live in a hotel
01:14:44 and then we have like a fun time
01:14:46 and we could
01:14:48 literally just get an Airbnb
01:14:50 who cares it's fine
01:14:52 why can't it be both
01:14:54 well the reason it can't be both
01:14:56 is really just
01:14:58 there's no point going to such a place
01:15:00 if we're going to stay in one place and record
01:15:02 and not actually go out
01:15:04 literally go out and do stuff for a day or two
01:15:06 out of like the 10 days or whatever
01:15:08 how expensive is it to live like
01:15:10 just in Japan
01:15:12 and it is fair
01:15:14 do they have airbnbs in Japan
01:15:16 I don't know but we could look into it
01:15:18 alright there's no need to like fucking break
01:15:20 the fucking thing down I'm just saying it be cool
01:15:22 radcon 5 right now
01:15:24 agree it would be cool
01:15:26 do you agree alright
01:15:28 thank you
01:15:30 catch a farfetched
01:15:32 there you go
01:15:34 radcon 5 the quest for farfetched
01:15:36 that's what it is
01:15:38 that's the one
01:15:40 we don't have to get them
01:15:42 we have to transfer them
01:15:44 radcon exclusively
01:15:46 for pokemon go
01:15:48 exclusively no other content available
01:15:50 oh my god
01:15:52 two more questions
01:15:54 chip in the francs
01:15:56 similar question
01:15:58 what's a mundane everyday miracle
01:16:00 that you noticed and recognized
01:16:02 this is a really interesting one
01:16:04 yeah magnets
01:16:06 an everyday miracle
01:16:08 I mean just being alive
01:16:10 period
01:16:12 okay
01:16:14 what do you say is a miracle
01:16:16 is that just like for us to interpret in any way we want
01:16:18 I think so yeah
01:16:20 I get hung up on the word miracle
01:16:22 only because if people say that life is a miracle
01:16:24 we can exactly trace back why life exists
01:16:26 so what do we mean
01:16:28 think about like Dr. Manhattan
01:16:30 talking about how like
01:16:32 a spectacularly unlikely event
01:16:34 is a miracle
01:16:36 by that definition being alive
01:16:38 is definitely one
01:16:40 I mean to me when I think
01:16:42 miracle I think like
01:16:44 not necessarily something that doesn't happen
01:16:46 but something that I don't see a lot
01:16:48 and it's just like really like oh yeah
01:16:50 okay and for me
01:16:52 that would be like a sunrise
01:16:54 it's like Jesus walked
01:16:56 on water but in Kirby I can just run
01:16:58 across water so like there's an everyday miracle
01:17:00 like I was just playing Kirby so
01:17:02 there it is
01:17:04 it's just an everyday miracle
01:17:06 I think he's using the definition of miracle
01:17:08 which is not really a miracle
01:17:10 like the ICP version of miracle
01:17:12 something that you really like
01:17:14 when it happens
01:17:16 there's like oh thank god
01:17:18 the electricity works
01:17:20 what a fucking miracle
01:17:22 I think video games are an amazing
01:17:24 everyday miracle that I absolutely love
01:17:26 and I'm so thankful and the internet I guess
01:17:28 but I'm gonna go with video games
01:17:30 that's perfect because that's like
01:17:32 god we evolved in the way
01:17:34 that allows us humans to create
01:17:36 video games like what a miracle
01:17:38 I was gonna say
01:17:40 when somebody that I know
01:17:42 never followed me before
01:17:44 just leaves a nice comment and says I'm subscribing
01:17:46 that's a nice thing
01:17:48 that doesn't happen very often but when it does
01:17:50 it's like yeah I can do it
01:17:52 because of this
01:17:54 do you have an everyday miracle?
01:17:56 um
01:18:00 when someone goes to patreon.com
01:18:02 slash fantasy
01:18:04 I already said being alive
01:18:06 yeah
01:18:08 being dead
01:18:10 the two sides of the same coin
01:18:12 um
01:18:14 the oculus rift
01:18:16 the oculus rift
01:18:18 the ability of the fact that I can enter cyberspace
01:18:20 at um at any time
01:18:22 yeah that's good
01:18:24 the fact that you were able to
01:18:26 successful kickstarter
01:18:28 that's an opportunity
01:18:30 the fact that the pcp exists
01:18:32 and is real and I'm a part of it
01:18:34 aww
01:18:36 and then it makes things possible
01:18:38 the fact that I could do this kickstarter
01:18:40 which by the way the vapers books just
01:18:42 arrived this morning
01:18:44 ohhh yeah
01:18:46 that's exciting
01:18:48 and the oculus rift is the stretch goal
01:18:50 and then I actually hit the stretch goal
01:18:52 and then the radcon can happen
01:18:54 and you know we get to do all this cool stuff
01:18:56 the fact that we got the t-bap stretch goal
01:18:58 in fucking radcon 3
01:19:00 is an everyday miracle
01:19:02 not even everyday
01:19:04 that's like a
01:19:06 shock
01:19:08 that was a perfect segue into my segue
01:19:10 you want to know what my everyday miracle is?
01:19:12 segues
01:19:14 here's a new question for you
01:19:16 do you guys have a childhood dream that you've successfully fulfilled
01:19:18 being in the pcp
01:19:20 well being in the horseshoe crew
01:19:22 really but
01:19:24 well that's great
01:19:26 you're still in your childhood
01:19:28 so you're fulfilling that dream right now
01:19:30 exactly
01:19:32 excuse me yummies I'm such a little baby boy
01:19:34 don't you want me to be big
01:19:36 and strong
01:19:38 I need my yummy chocolate
01:19:40 I don't want you getting any bigger or stronger
01:19:42 yeah that would be a danger to us all
01:19:44 I guess if I get any bigger
01:19:46 or any stronger
01:19:48 it would be a serious threat to not
01:19:50 it would be like
01:19:52 in the animatrix when that guy
01:19:54 literally became more physically strong
01:19:56 and fast at running
01:19:58 that was able to be handled by the matrix
01:20:00 and he shattered out of it
01:20:02 what the fuck
01:20:04 sounds like my life
01:20:06 that's literally it
01:20:08 with your resting heartbeat clipping the microphone of real life
01:20:10 every moment
01:20:12 pretty good
01:20:14 this was fine
01:20:16 oh by the way I just want to say
01:20:18 another missed opportunity at radcon 3
01:20:20 doing the oculus rift
01:20:22 yeah I brought it
01:20:24 and I brought my graphics card
01:20:26 and it didn't seem like
01:20:28 it didn't seem like it was going to work
01:20:30 we burned it out lighting at night too much
01:20:32 Tom said that it might have worked on his laptop
01:20:34 but we kind of ran out of time
01:20:36 and didn't get to like give it a shot
01:20:38 so that was a shame
01:20:40 oh well next time
01:20:42 actually in everyday miracles my computer didn't
01:20:44 break it radcon
01:20:46 it was really fucking
01:20:48 I mean well I'm jealous because my computer
01:20:50 did break it radcon
01:20:52 and now my laptop keyboard doesn't work
01:20:54 so it's all
