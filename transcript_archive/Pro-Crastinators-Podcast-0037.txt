00:00:00 A boy was wandering far from home with his loyal growlith, Growly.
00:00:06 They were both freezing and they hadn't eaten in days.
00:00:13 Growly, I'm not going to make it.
00:00:16 Leave me alone and save yourself.
00:00:19 Oh.
00:00:27 The angels have come for me.
00:00:30 Farewell, I leave this cruel world for a better place.
00:00:34 Remember me, Grow...
00:00:37 Ugh.
00:00:38 Growl...
00:00:41 Growl...
00:00:43 Growl...
00:00:45 Growl...
00:00:46 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:51 Yay!
00:00:52 Yeah, we're back.
00:00:53 We're back.
00:00:55 Even better than it was the last time, baby.
00:00:57 Mm-mm-mm.
00:00:58 I'm good and we're back.
00:01:00 And it is me, the best guy ever, joined by a whole cast of deplorables.
00:01:05 First up, we got...
00:01:06 A whole nation of them.
00:01:07 A whole nation of...
00:01:08 A whole nation of basket.
00:01:10 A basket, that's right.
00:01:12 That's the one.
00:01:13 So hey, there's Digibro over there.
00:01:15 Hey, what's up buddy?
00:01:16 Over there is Ben Saint.
00:01:18 Yeah, that's me. That's me.
00:01:20 We got Lethal Aurora Mage.
00:01:22 I'm back.
00:01:23 With a much improved mic to my delight.
00:01:26 Oh, that's right.
00:01:27 That's right.
00:01:28 Here's Hippocrite.
00:01:29 Gotta catch a mole.
00:01:33 Yeah.
00:01:34 And, uh...
00:01:35 Throw me off there.
00:01:36 And, uh, uh, Monkey Jones.
00:01:37 Well, if it isn't that motherfucker Ben Saint.
00:01:41 You son of a bitch.
00:01:43 Now, but before things get too crazy here.
00:01:46 My mortal enemy.
00:01:47 Fucking hate this bastard.
00:01:48 Now, hang on guys.
00:01:49 We have to establish this.
00:01:51 This is an official...
00:01:52 I'm sputtering with rage.
00:01:53 Sputtering, I tell you.
00:01:54 This is an official government sanctioned safe space.
00:01:57 This is a safe space between the nations of Ben Saint and Monkey Jones.
00:02:03 Have you provided Legos and Play-Doh for constructive, non-critical play?
00:02:08 I need a coloring book, dude.
00:02:09 That's right.
00:02:10 There are looping videos of cute puppies and cats.
00:02:13 So don't fret.
00:02:14 I'm allergic to cats.
00:02:15 You're free to excuse yourself.
00:02:16 Monkey hates dogs.
00:02:18 This is triggering.
00:02:19 You're triggering.
00:02:20 Whee!
00:02:22 I hate being relaxed.
00:02:23 I hate not being triggered.
00:02:25 It triggers me.
00:02:25 Oh, no.
00:02:26 What do we do?
00:02:27 All right.
00:02:28 Well, okay.
00:02:29 Now that's out of the way.
00:02:30 So, so this is, uh, uh, quite a fortuitous time to be alive.
00:02:34 Cause as you know, folks, uh, if you're not already following the glorious battle
00:02:38 between Ben Saint and Monkey Jones.
00:02:40 Actually, we haven't seen your battle yet, have we?
00:02:42 It hasn't gotten to that point yet.
00:02:43 It has not aired yet.
00:02:44 It'll be out on December 1st, I think.
00:02:46 Yeah, it's really December 1st.
00:02:48 Okay, so that's it.
00:02:49 It's coming.
00:02:50 Um, yes.
00:02:51 Well, that'll, that'll be hype as fuck anyway.
00:02:54 So we're here to celebrate not only their great battle, uh, but, but the,
00:02:58 the field upon which that battle is taking place, the release of Pokemon Sun and Moon.
00:03:03 The new, new, that's the, that's the hot topic.
00:03:06 Yeah.
00:03:07 I mean, it's hot for me.
00:03:08 It's hot.
00:03:09 But it's called for monkey because he's using these moon instead of sun.
00:03:13 Yeah.
00:03:13 Yes.
00:03:14 Yes.
00:03:15 So let's, uh, we're going to talk about, about Sun and Moon and our thoughts on it
00:03:18 and stuff, um, and also Pokemon in general.
00:03:21 And then I think we'll probably spend more time on that because a lot of the things
00:03:24 that I personally have to say about Sun and Moon are specifically in the context
00:03:28 of the whole series and how kind of just ways that they could be improved
00:03:32 or my personal vision for what it could be.
00:03:34 And I'll be interested to hear what you guys all have to say.
00:03:36 So who's got a hot opinion about Sun and Moon?
00:03:40 I got a hot opinion.
00:03:41 I got a hot opinion.
00:03:42 I got to say that I've thought a lot about it and I see the pros.
00:03:48 I see the good points of Pokemon Ride.
00:03:50 I really do.
00:03:51 There's some things about it that I like, but overall I hate it.
00:03:55 About Pokemon?
00:03:56 Pokemon Ride.
00:03:57 Oh, Ride.
00:03:58 Like, like I get the advantage.
00:04:00 Oh, come on, you fucking baby.
00:04:02 No, you're the baby.
00:04:04 You're not even a human.
00:04:05 Get out of here.
00:04:06 It's OK.
00:04:07 It is kind of cool, but all right.
00:04:09 Just OK.
00:04:12 Everyone's like, oh, now now there's no more HMS.
00:04:15 Thank God.
00:04:16 Now we can just ride them.
00:04:17 I mean, I've complained about HMS before and I didn't like them.
00:04:21 But but the chains that they have made, they didn't fix them in the way I wanted
00:04:25 them to, I wanted them to fix them in a way that made Pokemon feel more like real
00:04:29 things that like I have.
00:04:32 Wanted it to be like your Pokemon can just surf if they're a water Pokemon.
00:04:36 You don't have to.
00:04:37 Right.
00:04:38 They made it even less like that.
00:04:40 Now no Pokemon can surf.
00:04:41 No Pokemon that you catch.
00:04:43 Can you ride on now?
00:04:44 Only this one lapras.
00:04:46 Yeah, but can you imagine that actually going to the process of having every
00:04:51 water Pokemon have its own sprite?
00:04:52 How are you going to ride on your tent to cruel?
00:04:54 What's that going to look like?
00:04:56 I don't.
00:04:56 It doesn't matter.
00:04:58 Yeah, it would be easy.
00:05:00 Here's where you're fucked up, Ben.
00:05:02 Go ahead, Hippo.
00:05:03 Well, I can imagine it being easy if they just if they just swap out a model of
00:05:07 like the idle animation for like for swimming.
00:05:10 I mean, you know what that look like?
00:05:11 You know what that look like?
00:05:12 You know when I was just using my two cannon who's using his his Z attack of
00:05:17 which is another topic that we can talk about.
00:05:19 But like when he does his Z attack, it's it's sort of a generic
00:05:23 like he's just doing an idle animation.
00:05:25 He's put through this big.
00:05:26 He's put through this big sort of attack thing.
00:05:28 But the thing is he flies up and he dives down to do this attack.
00:05:31 He is a perfectly stationary bird with his wings folded at his sides.
00:05:36 While he is doing this attack, it looks ridiculous.
00:05:38 It looks.
00:05:39 It doesn't have you seen that one of way Lord doing the like the spin attack?
00:05:44 No, I think did you didn't you retweet it?
00:05:47 Is it the steel one or something?
00:05:49 I have no idea.
00:05:49 There's I don't know.
00:05:52 Yeah, because it was some weird music.
00:05:54 The point is this way.
00:05:56 He just does this incredible like fucking disco spin.
00:05:59 It's like it's a whale.
00:06:01 Well, that sounds awesome.
00:06:03 OK, but my point is just that I think that practically if they did some sort of
00:06:08 generic like use a ride animation thing, it would it would be similarly.
00:06:12 Well, for water, I think it could work.
00:06:15 I don't think it could work for ground type because they wouldn't be moving.
00:06:19 Yeah. And here's where Ben fucked up.
00:06:21 I think the reason why he doesn't like this is because you picked the male
00:06:25 character, the female character when you ride a Pokemon.
00:06:29 She like puts on different outfits.
00:06:30 And when you're surfing in particular, you get to see her mid rift.
00:06:33 It's really fucking cute.
00:06:34 I mean, I mean, I do think that the Taurus riding uniform is pretty dumb looking.
00:06:39 I don't like it.
00:06:40 But they're all you surf as a girl, dude.
00:06:43 All right.
00:06:44 You haven't even gotten to you haven't even gotten to when you get Machamp
00:06:47 and you get to be you get to be cradled.
00:06:50 Oh, my God, I was going to say Machamp.
00:06:52 It's like the creative.
00:06:54 It literally princess carries you.
00:06:56 Someone should go to jail for including that.
00:07:01 I was going to that part.
00:07:03 Yeah, what the fuck did he?
00:07:06 Well, I think differently from you.
00:07:10 I don't think of the ride Pokemon as a replacement for HM.
00:07:13 But that's what they are.
00:07:14 That's what they are.
00:07:15 They are, but rather than that,
00:07:18 what's cool about them is that they're a replacement for like the fucking bicycle.
00:07:22 You know, like you can play in Pokemon for all this time and you've been riding
00:07:26 a bike as opposed to a Pokemon like it just like I see the Taurus as hey,
00:07:31 instead of a bike for getting around quickly, now you get to ride a Taurus and
00:07:35 like charge through shit and is way cooler, you know, ride on a Taurus.
00:07:39 But I just don't see why it had to be only a Taurus.
00:07:46 I don't understand why because they would have had to build models for every
00:07:49 thing.
00:07:51 There is there is a third option.
00:07:53 It's not the models, it's the animations.
00:07:54 There is a third option here.
00:07:56 They could do some sort of like for all this time.
00:07:59 You're the one crying.
00:08:00 The Pokemon company can't afford to fucking do it.
00:08:04 You know, I don't know.
00:08:05 They make this game so cheaply and they cut so many fucking corners.
00:08:10 Like, I mean, with this game and this is maybe Nate will comment on this as well.
00:08:14 This vision for what the Pokemon games should be.
00:08:17 And I sort of addressed this in my own video that like I think the funniest
00:08:21 thing about Pokemon is that even though there's like this,
00:08:23 there's very complex systems in place, like I think probably most of the time
00:08:27 they spend making the game goes into just balancing it.
00:08:30 But like if you look at any other RPG, there's so much more complex with what
00:08:35 like NPCs are doing, dude, you know, where you've got games like fucking
00:08:39 Xenoblade where like every NPC has an entire life and like they're only around
00:08:43 at certain times a day.
00:08:44 You know, the number one representation of that,
00:08:47 the number one thing that tells me that is just the facial animation of your
00:08:52 character, which is to say there is none.
00:08:54 There is exactly one expression and it never, ever changes.
00:08:57 It honestly is the worst thing about the entire game.
00:08:59 It pissed me off so many times.
00:09:01 Stop smiling. Stop fucking smiling.
00:09:03 Actually, I kind of disagree because of the fact that I was my character was
00:09:08 wearing sunglasses and I really liked the idea that my character was just so
00:09:12 disaffected that nothing mattered.
00:09:14 I got the impression that my character was like, I'm so powerful and like none
00:09:19 of this matters to me.
00:09:20 Like when they attack me, I'm just going to beat them.
00:09:22 I'll give you that.
00:09:24 Getting those sunglasses was a massive upgrade to my enjoyment of this game
00:09:27 because those vacant, soulless eyes staring at me every fucking second of every cutscene,
00:09:32 no matter what was happening, not a fan.
00:09:35 I just enjoy it.
00:09:36 I hear people praising the ride system and like, yeah, I do think it is.
00:09:42 I think that what it lets you do is cool.
00:09:44 But the fact that it has moved away from like a relationship you form with your
00:09:49 Pokemon, it's it's the opposite of what I wanted.
00:09:52 And overall, I really hate it.
00:09:54 And I really think that people are being or just fucking letting Nintendo off the hook
00:09:57 for this one. I think they have the fucking resources.
00:10:00 They could animate.
00:10:02 They could animate every, they could animate all 700 Pokemon in a riding
00:10:06 animation if they wanted to.
00:10:07 They could do it.
00:10:08 Why don't they do it?
00:10:10 But everyone is just like, everyone's happy with this.
00:10:13 I don't disagree, Ben.
00:10:14 We should not be happy with it.
00:10:15 This is not good enough.
00:10:17 When it comes to Pokemon, like if I got everything I wanted out of it,
00:10:20 it would be a totally different game.
00:10:22 It would like every, I mean, every generation, like when Pokemon X and Y came out,
00:10:28 it had tons of problems with the fact that like it was 3D graphics.
00:10:31 The level design didn't make sense with the 3D graphics.
00:10:34 There was chugging and slow down.
00:10:36 It was not optimized well for the console.
00:10:38 This game was not optimized.
00:10:39 It's a nightmare.
00:10:40 It is like every valley just doubles battles.
00:10:43 It's a shiny new 3DS XL just very recently.
00:10:47 And it lacks for me on double battles.
00:10:48 That's weird.
00:10:49 There you go.
00:10:50 Yeah, yeah, it's even on the new one.
00:10:53 So double battles are still laggy.
00:10:54 In X and Y, it was even worse, though.
00:10:56 Even normal battles could lag if you had too many big Pokemon.
00:10:59 I'm not quite done with the ride thing.
00:11:00 I'm not quite done ranting about ride.
00:11:02 I just have one ride cake, which is simply that I have one more point to make.
00:11:07 In X and Y, they upgraded to 3D and it was like there was a whole ton of problems.
00:11:11 And the way that people talked about it, anytime you brought up the 3D,
00:11:14 like how these, you know, there's all these graphical failings,
00:11:17 people would always say, well, it's the first Pokemon game in 3D.
00:11:21 So there's bound to be some stumbling blocks.
00:11:23 But it's not the first 3D game ever.
00:11:26 1995, it's not.
00:11:29 Yeah, it's not like they had to invent 3D and like, you know,
00:11:32 they should have just held off if they didn't understand the principles of how
00:11:36 the graphics work, then they should have held off until they did before they released the game.
00:11:41 And I do think like Sun and Moon shows a lot of lessons learned from X and Y
00:11:45 about how to 3D, but then like, still, it feels like Pokemon makes progress
00:11:50 so incredibly slowly and the fans are just kind of used to it because I mean,
00:11:54 people have complained about HMS for fucking 20 years now and it just now finally got changed.
00:11:59 So not enough.
00:12:00 I'm honestly surprised that they changed it because I felt like no one was really
00:12:05 mad about it the way I was mad about it.
00:12:08 I've heard people complain about it all the time.
00:12:10 Were you?
00:12:10 Yeah.
00:12:11 Well, I'm not the vocal about my anger, I guess.
00:12:15 OK, OK.
00:12:17 The thing about Riot, here is a compromise that I would be willing to live with.
00:12:20 And everyone's going to hate this, but this is a compromise that I would accept.
00:12:24 If it were exactly the way it is now in Sun and Moon only,
00:12:28 you had to catch a Taurus and have it in your party to do the thing.
00:12:32 If you had to catch a Sharpedo, if you if you just if it's like
00:12:35 hey, you can't you can't ride around with our Taurus, here's how this compromise
00:12:39 will work for me, because I think the problem with that is that I would hate
00:12:43 it would only be the one, but but even if it were only the one, I would still
00:12:47 think it would that is that it would force you to have it in your team.
00:12:50 And that's why I know it would be obnoxious.
00:12:52 I know it would be obnoxious in the pain and then I'm going to give you a solution to that.
00:12:56 I want that.
00:12:57 I'm going to give you a solution to it, though.
00:12:59 I don't maybe I don't want solutions.
00:13:01 Maybe I just want to think about what if it's actually what if you can catch
00:13:06 a Taurus, hold on, I want to do my solution.
00:13:08 What if you can catch a Taurus and assign it as the ride Pokemon and then you
00:13:12 don't have to have it in your party, you just use it for rides.
00:13:15 Yes, OK. Yeah.
00:13:16 Yeah. As long as it's the one you caught.
00:13:19 Yeah. Ben, we do Nuzlocke.
00:13:21 So you if you didn't have a water Pokemon, you could literally just not be able
00:13:25 to progress in the game at some point.
00:13:27 Yeah. Yeah. So why would you like that?
00:13:29 That's fucking stupid.
00:13:30 What is that already? You just have to make sure you just have to make sure you
00:13:33 catch a water Pokemon.
00:13:35 It is already true.
00:13:37 I mean, I've always thought that probably provides you an area where to catch
00:13:40 the Pokemon you need anyway. So.
00:13:41 Well, yeah, but with Nuzlocke, nothing is nothing's guaranteed.
00:13:44 But like that, you just have to be careful and just make sure I'm going to need
00:13:49 a water Pokemon.
00:13:50 This is kind of a tangential point.
00:13:52 But I always thought it'd be reasonable in something like a Nuzlocke to to catch
00:13:55 a Pokemon specifically just to advance beyond a certain point.
00:13:59 And then you don't let it go or whatever.
00:14:00 Why would that be cheating? Why is that if the game is like if.
00:14:05 I don't know if the game have to have a water Pokemon to let you progress,
00:14:09 then maybe, I don't know.
00:14:10 I mean, I think that if you if you're all your surfers die,
00:14:13 then I think it's fun to be like, well, I can't win now because I let all my
00:14:17 surfers die. I think that's cool.
00:14:19 But by the way, let me just say about the ride thing.
00:14:22 I basically agree with you guys, which almost happened to me in white, too.
00:14:26 But anyway, yeah, I did.
00:14:28 I have one left.
00:14:29 I definitely am leaning on your side here, Ben.
00:14:32 I think I consider it a massive loss to lose the kind of personal connection
00:14:38 you have by using a Pokemon that you personally have captured and trained in
00:14:41 whatever degree that you have.
00:14:43 I consider a huge loss to not have that kind of connection with the thing.
00:14:46 Instead of some sort of like corporatized, like mass bred Pokemon like who gives a shit?
00:14:51 I feel I just I like that they're trying a new thing.
00:14:55 But I feel like it went in the exact opposite way that I wanted it to.
00:15:00 I wanted I want the games to demand
00:15:03 that like I I harness the power of my Pokemon.
00:15:07 Yeah, and that's the and that's not at all what's going on here.
00:15:10 Even though I think it's cool, it's cool to ride around on the Lappers.
00:15:13 It's cool to ride around a Sharpedo and and be and be cradled in the strong
00:15:18 manly bosom of a champ.
00:15:19 Yeah, there's a Sharpedo later, but my favorite guy.
00:15:23 It's radical. It's riding the Sharpedo was fucking dope.
00:15:26 It's my favorite thing.
00:15:27 Can we move on from ride Pokemon?
00:15:29 I want to say one more thing.
00:15:30 OK, I from for my part, I'm satisfied.
00:15:34 OK, I generally agree with you about the whole thing.
00:15:36 And I would and I think it would be cool if you could, you know, catch your own
00:15:40 rideable Pokemon and stuff, but this ride function, as it is now,
00:15:44 it kind of endeared me to a few Pokemon I didn't particularly like or didn't
00:15:47 usually use on my team, like Stealthon.
00:15:50 I don't particularly like Stealthon, but then I got one and I started riding it
00:15:54 and it's just kind of so cute when it sniffs the ground and I was so happy
00:15:57 when it finds the item. It's I kind of like it now.
00:16:01 Yeah, I can see that.
00:16:03 I consider that a small game, though.
00:16:05 And I think I don't think there's any negatives to the ride system.
00:16:08 And I think you're all fucking insane.
00:16:10 Stop talking about it, because it's been 15 fucking minutes to talk about the ride system.
00:16:15 If there were maybe if there were maybe a dozen different Pokemon.
00:16:18 This is what my fear was about this podcast.
00:16:21 Yeah, let's do a Pokemon podcast with six people.
00:16:24 That was like any one tiny thing you could say about Pokemon, we could do a whole
00:16:28 podcast. Yeah, they could like they could animate a dozen different Pokemon.
00:16:32 All right, Ben. All right, we get it.
00:16:34 I want to say I want to say that the Pokemon rights is not about writing,
00:16:38 but it is about animation.
00:16:40 I got a grubbin and I evolved him into a fucking battery bus little guy.
00:16:44 He's a cuboid. I love him.
00:16:45 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but he for some reason, he can learn.
00:16:50 He can learn acrobatics, which is a flying move.
00:16:52 Yeah. And I and I kept that with him.
00:16:54 So now he is is basically a little bus
00:16:57 that flies through the air and beats the shit out of him.
00:17:00 That is awesome.
00:17:02 Oh, speaking of animations, did you know that some Pokemon can high five you?
00:17:07 Huh? What? How?
00:17:08 Yeah, like friendship all the way up or just no one.
00:17:12 No, no, no, all you have to do is like
00:17:14 was I think starters have this except for Rala because he doesn't really he can't
00:17:18 really high five you. But basically, like if you hold your
00:17:22 mouse, I said, I'm sure mouse and whatever cursor, yeah, near them,
00:17:27 they kind of start pawing at it.
00:17:29 And you hold them close enough near them, not on them.
00:17:34 And they start pawing at it.
00:17:36 Only some Pokemon can do that.
00:17:37 And if you're close enough, they kind of high five you because they can reach
00:17:42 your cursor, you're talking about when you're doing like the combing thing.
00:17:46 No, yeah, yeah, yeah, in general.
00:17:49 Yeah, yeah, in the Pokemon refresh thing.
00:17:52 Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
00:17:53 That's pretty neat.
00:17:54 Oh, and like let's talk about I give give tip
00:17:57 me out to a bunch of the little touches, like if you spin your character a bunch,
00:18:00 they just do a twirl.
00:18:02 Yeah, let's talk about the main improvement that Sun and Moon offers,
00:18:05 which is the twirl. The twirl is I love the twirl.
00:18:09 Honestly, my opinion of this game was as if you were following my Twitter was
00:18:13 extremely low going in and then it got steadily better because the game,
00:18:17 like it front loads all the bad bullshit and then it gets much better because it
00:18:21 just lets you play.
00:18:22 I think I caught my first Pokemon, like half an hour in.
00:18:26 It was two hours.
00:18:27 It was at least another half an hour before I caught another one.
00:18:30 The opening. I don't know why people think it's too long.
00:18:33 It's really fucking long.
00:18:34 It's really bad.
00:18:36 Well, you know why? OK, you know why.
00:18:38 There's a very simple reason for why it was so long.
00:18:41 It's because the every cutscene and there are a billion of them in the beginning.
00:18:45 I haven't even deployed content that it's and by that,
00:18:48 I mean that like the lead in to like the thing, like they have to fade in and like
00:18:52 set the scene and then like all the transitions.
00:18:54 But there's so much about that because it makes me care about the world and
00:18:58 characters. I don't even I don't even think it was bad.
00:19:01 They were about an actual RPG almost.
00:19:04 But the first island took me eight fucking hours.
00:19:07 Yeah, that means you play slow.
00:19:09 If it's the full island.
00:19:10 Well, yeah, I'm just saying that it takes it takes you.
00:19:15 All right. I mean, OK, so not everybody has to agree.
00:19:18 But I think that this game continued a trend.
00:19:20 I don't like of taking things like loading up too much bullshit.
00:19:24 You have to sort through until you can actually just play the game.
00:19:27 And this was the worst defender of the actually just to jump back to what
00:19:30 monkey said. I mean, you said the first island took you eight hours.
00:19:34 But that's a fourth of the game.
00:19:36 That's not a four.
00:19:37 The first island does not have the same.
00:19:39 The first island is only one of the seven challenges.
00:19:41 It's seven. Yeah.
00:19:43 But well, yeah.
00:19:44 But the other challenges don't have three hours of cutscenes before them.
00:19:48 So like you've played like you've played a fourth of the runtime of the game
00:19:54 at this point, like if you're off the first island, you know, it's the game.
00:19:58 40 hours, you know, it was bullshit that you guys, I think, liked, you know,
00:20:02 that ceremony, that piece of shit, retarded ceremony where your Pokemon that you
00:20:06 chose chooses you back.
00:20:07 Oh, yeah, I really feel, I really feel special being chosen by this Pokemon
00:20:11 that has no option by this cutscene.
00:20:14 Feels right. Yeah, I've been chosen by this cutscene.
00:20:16 Yeah, I was a little dumb.
00:20:17 OK, I like the game.
00:20:19 I'm babing you guys, you guys.
00:20:22 It's a fucking Pokemon game.
00:20:24 I don't know if you've noticed the plots of these games and really are going to
00:20:28 help us at some point.
00:20:29 My argument is that it was cute and I like I like the little clown boy.
00:20:35 And he's my favorite guy and I love him in my arms.
00:20:38 I don't mind cute.
00:20:39 I love the Pokemon refresh mechanic.
00:20:42 I love petting my Pokemon.
00:20:43 And in fact, honestly, I think my favorite thing about this game,
00:20:46 a new change is the the way that after a battle, you can treat your Pokemon status
00:20:51 ailments and Pokemon refresh.
00:20:52 I love that so much.
00:20:54 It makes so much sense to me.
00:20:55 And you can bond with them and pet them and stuff.
00:20:57 That's great.
00:20:58 And I can rub my Machoke's dick and he's like, yes, yes, this is what I saw that.
00:21:02 Yeah, it's the greatest.
00:21:03 It's the greatest.
00:21:04 That is a great mechanic that makes all the sense in the world.
00:21:07 And it should have been there all along.
00:21:09 If it was the Machoke dick rubbing, you mean?
00:21:11 Yes, curing status ailments is great.
00:21:14 I think Nate that Pokemon has always been incredibly patronizing.
00:21:18 That's every all this is like 80 percent of all dialogue in every Pokemon game.
00:21:23 Wow, you and your Pokemon get along so well.
00:21:26 You're such a good trainer.
00:21:27 You treat Pokemon better than everyone else.
00:21:30 But here's the difference. Everyone loves you.
00:21:31 You're great. You're amazing.
00:21:32 All right, no trainers ever been so connected to their Pokemon.
00:21:36 You've defeated me, the ultimate trainer, Lance, the dragon master,
00:21:40 that's fucking shatter of universes.
00:21:42 It must be because you and your Pokemon are just have such a strong bond.
00:21:46 That's so much about the six guys you kept in a box for half the game.
00:21:50 That's perfectly reasonable that you beat Lance because you trained with your Pokemon.
00:21:54 OK, look, the difference is that this game and this was this was the worst.
00:21:58 This was the worst it's ever been by far.
00:22:00 And this is the biggest problem with the game.
00:22:02 This continues the trend of babying you so fucking hard.
00:22:06 And that is the biggest difficulty with the game, Nate.
00:22:09 Yes, that's that's correct.
00:22:11 It is a tone problem.
00:22:12 It is a massive tone problem.
00:22:14 You're a tone problem.
00:22:15 I'll tell you what I'll tell you if you let me fuck Pokemon is a baby game.
00:22:19 It is a baby game.
00:22:20 OK, you guys are bringing up all these things about how
00:22:22 Pokemon's a baby game and how we shouldn't have standards of quality.
00:22:25 And we're very bad because always just Pokemon.
00:22:28 But no, I refused to to lower my standards
00:22:31 because other games didn't fuck up in the way that this game did.
00:22:35 You're such an idiot, Nate.
00:22:36 It didn't fuck up anything.
00:22:38 You're just being when it added one extra second of cutscene.
00:22:41 No, I'm not talking about that.
00:22:43 You're not letting me get to my point.
00:22:44 Well, Nate, I know what you're saying, but you're implying that this is
00:22:48 inherently a bad thing that like no one wants a game like this.
00:22:53 When the reality is that for a lot of people, this is fine.
00:22:56 And you chose to play a Pokemon.
00:22:57 Dude, all right.
00:22:58 Tell me, tell me, tell me that you enjoyed how just eating your fucking
00:23:06 dick after you beat him every time.
00:23:08 Like how rewarding was it for you to defeat how?
00:23:10 And he's like, well, that was a great fucking battle.
00:23:13 I sure love getting my shit kicked in.
00:23:15 Let's do it again.
00:23:15 That wasn't the point that I'm making.
00:23:17 Everyone hates how everyone doesn't like how.
00:23:20 Why do we have to have a city rival?
00:23:22 Major, I'm glad somebody like that.
00:23:24 You have like five rivals and half of them hate and all of them are terrible.
00:23:28 All of them are bad.
00:23:29 None of them are good.
00:23:30 You don't like the blonde kid?
00:23:31 That guy was awesome.
00:23:32 He's all edgy and shit.
00:23:33 Yeah, I did like him.
00:23:35 I didn't he legitimately hates you.
00:23:37 He's like, especially hates how he hates how so much that I was like high
00:23:41 fiving him when you know, it was good.
00:23:43 You know, it was good about that character.
00:23:45 He had an actual motivation.
00:23:47 He was protecting this this null Pokemon.
00:23:49 It was this whole big fucking thing that was cool.
00:23:51 That made him an interesting.
00:23:53 How it doesn't have a motivation when he wants to become the he wants to surpass
00:23:56 his father and become a kahuna because he sees his self as an inferiority complex
00:24:01 because his father's been a great trainer his whole life.
00:24:03 He did nothing to make me care.
00:24:05 I knew all those facts, though.
00:24:07 You don't have to care about if he has some motivations.
00:24:11 Look, it's not about his action.
00:24:13 Your motivation at all.
00:24:14 So fucking vague is pissing me right the fuck off.
00:24:18 All right, I think I don't even know what I mean.
00:24:21 I don't think you even know what you mean.
00:24:23 Let hippo talk.
00:24:24 All right.
00:24:25 What? Oh, well,
00:24:26 I was going to say,
00:24:28 I think Nate is like it's just just a simple point that is sort of blending into
00:24:34 other points that he doesn't like how he doesn't like how how how's is is so happy.
00:24:39 He prefers Gary, who's like, eh, fuck you for beating me.
00:24:43 Or like the redhead from Crystal.
00:24:44 Like an actual rival.
00:24:45 And when you fight Gary,
00:24:47 one game doesn't really have a rival as far as I know.
00:24:49 When you defeat blue, blue is fucking pissed and it makes you feel good that you
00:24:54 overcame someone who wanted to win.
00:24:57 I actually gave a shit.
00:24:58 But literally every other rival in this game is like that.
00:25:01 And how what are these other rivals?
00:25:03 There's there's him and there's the blonde kid.
00:25:05 There's the blonde kid.
00:25:06 There's the girl who's part of Team Skull.
00:25:08 They both hate you.
00:25:09 She's not a fucking rival.
00:25:10 She's an enemy executive.
00:25:12 Nate, Hugh, what?
00:25:13 Hugh in black and white, too.
00:25:15 Every single time you beat him,
00:25:17 he tells you you're a cool guy and congratulates you on being so strong.
00:25:20 Same thing in black and white one.
00:25:21 Your rivals are just these like real nice,
00:25:24 chummy guys who just tell you right.
00:25:25 And I don't like to fight in all the newer games than your rivals are your
00:25:30 friends and like the yeah, it's always been bad journey.
00:25:32 It's been bad the whole time ever since Diamond and Pearl.
00:25:35 It's been a mistake.
00:25:36 They need to fix that.
00:25:37 I don't I don't like.
00:25:38 OK, think about just what does it imply?
00:25:41 They've got that.
00:25:41 They've got that in these other characters that are dicks to you.
00:25:44 And they've got this other guy.
00:25:45 Who's nice to you?
00:25:46 Just think about having both.
00:25:48 Think of think about this for one second.
00:25:50 What do we make of the fact?
00:25:51 What do we make of the fact that our rival now used to choose the Pokemon
00:25:55 that was strong against us now picks the Pokemon that we are super strong
00:25:59 and we can wipe the floor with all that is done.
00:26:01 What are we to make of the night?
00:26:02 I don't know. It's made me feel like I'm now Gary Oak.
00:26:06 That's a good boy.
00:26:08 Yeah, yeah, we're the villains.
00:26:09 And I'm the cool one and I'm getting all the girls even though I am a girl.
00:26:13 You know, hypocrite, you just changed my mind on this.
00:26:15 Now that I'm the villain, I think I love this a lot more.
00:26:18 You guys are being mean to me.
00:26:20 Like again, you have other rivals who hate you and do have Pokemon you're weak to
00:26:25 and how later does get an EV Lucian that is whatever your your starter is weak to?
00:26:30 So he doesn't get on page.
00:26:32 And what are you talking about? No, he doesn't.
00:26:34 Yeah, he does.
00:26:35 When you fight him, when you get into the Third Island,
00:26:37 when he like just fucking springs a battle on you right off the boat,
00:26:40 then he picks whatever EV Lucian your guys weak to.
00:26:43 So I had, you know, my grass starter.
00:26:45 He had a Flareon and his fucking Raichu and his in his pop or yeah,
00:26:51 probably a third ever and all of them were super fucking strong.
00:26:54 And it was like out of nowhere.
00:26:55 He was suddenly a hard battle and he fucking wiped me.
00:26:58 Oh, there's a real point.
00:27:00 There's a point I want to make.
00:27:02 Everyone shut up.
00:27:03 Yeah, Mage, what do you want to find about the rivals and that?
00:27:06 Yeah, well, not an hour, but yeah, about the rivals saying like in the past games,
00:27:10 maybe I didn't pay attention much or whatever, but like all the nice guys,
00:27:13 they didn't really have much to their character and they were just nice to be
00:27:17 nice with how, though, I haven't really gone farm the game, but already can pick up
00:27:20 that, you know, he has a bit more to him rather just being nice.
00:27:24 You've been tricked.
00:27:25 It's a fake.
00:27:26 After the first battle of the blonde edgelord,
00:27:31 he kind of says like, oh, he's strong, but I can tell that, you know,
00:27:36 he's not trying or whatever.
00:27:37 So he kind of gives the vibe that how's just kind of putting up putting up a
00:27:41 happy face or whatever.
00:27:42 Yeah, yeah.
00:27:42 Yeah, he has a bit of dialogue up to that way, where you can like you can put
00:27:46 how down or something and then how scowls at you.
00:27:49 I kind of like that.
00:27:50 Well, he, he like how constantly never stop smiling for me once the entire game.
00:27:54 He never stopped.
00:27:55 I told him attention and he's always like he's always trying to get you to react
00:27:59 to his jokes and stuff and he gets real pouty when you won't react to his jokes.
00:28:03 And like it's kind of implied that he has some fragility to his ego.
00:28:06 And then later in the game, like some stuff happens and he feels all bad that
00:28:10 he was like not strong enough.
00:28:12 And he's like, man, maybe I've been fucking goofing around too much.
00:28:15 And I'm not like taking things seriously enough.
00:28:17 He really is the catch him to to to my to my gary oak.
00:28:21 OK, all right, guys, you know what?
00:28:23 That's that's fine.
00:28:24 And I don't actually I don't hate the character of how my problem is simply
00:28:29 thus, I don't care for the increasingly infantile tone of the game is you leave
00:28:34 how alone, you big bully, I am living alone.
00:28:37 I just don't feel enough.
00:28:40 Oh, I don't know.
00:28:40 Like like the game is really trying to challenge me with anything.
00:28:43 Even when I was a little kid, I thought Pokemon was like condescending to me.
00:28:47 Like I always thought it was a baby game.
00:28:50 Like in terms of the way it talks to you, you know, like it constantly reassures
00:28:54 you and like tells you everything to do.
00:28:56 You've got I mean, from the second game, you have your fucking mom calling you
00:29:00 everywhere you go, making sure you've got enough money and just giving you money.
00:29:04 You know, like well, that happens in Earthbound as well.
00:29:07 And, you know, that's not.
00:29:09 That is a real game.
00:29:11 Earthbound is a baby game, kind of like the tone of Pokemon has changed
00:29:15 in any particular way.
00:29:17 It has or out of your fucking mind.
00:29:19 You guys are out of your fucking mind.
00:29:20 If you don't think that has definitely changed.
00:29:22 But I think that it's just that they have more features.
00:29:26 They've added more features.
00:29:28 They I think they've just made the Pokemon games more what they were always meant
00:29:31 to be in that they're a friendly, fun time that you have a nice leisurely
00:29:38 stroll through tells you you're doing by the way, this is like the hardest
00:29:41 Pokemon game ever.
00:29:43 So absolutely not.
00:29:44 It was a complete joke.
00:29:45 I never died once, not once.
00:29:47 I had 10 full party wives and I ended almost every major battle with all my
00:29:51 Pokemon dead, but one way I just I never overleveled.
00:29:55 I was always the same levels as what I fought and we're fucked.
00:29:57 I do.
00:29:58 I didn't overlevel.
00:29:59 I just might be a little game.
00:30:00 And yet I walked through every time.
00:30:02 I never did you only have like one team, the whole game or something like me.
00:30:06 Me and Mumpi are listening to this.
00:30:08 Like, well, why would I switch?
00:30:09 Everyone shut the fuck up.
00:30:10 Me and Mumpi's lives are hanging in the balance as we listen to this.
00:30:13 We're sweating bullets hearing all of it.
00:30:15 Yeah.
00:30:16 Well, I've got plenty of plenty of hints on how to deal with it.
00:30:20 We've got donators.
00:30:21 We have to please.
00:30:23 But we haven't even really touched about the the spiderweb of what I would
00:30:27 call casualization of this game.
00:30:29 How about the railroading, which I know has always been a thing,
00:30:32 but really was worse than ever.
00:30:34 You mean the railroading?
00:30:35 Every fucking Pokemon game is completely linear.
00:30:39 Every single one.
00:30:40 I'm aware of that.
00:30:41 But I think that not only do that, it wastes your time with cut scenes now.
00:30:46 Actually, I disagree with you.
00:30:49 Because when you put this up with who, with whom age, who do you disagree with?
00:30:52 Nate. OK.
00:30:54 Yeah, OK, so every game has been on a railroad.
00:30:56 But for the first time, I feel like, you know, this game,
00:31:00 this Pokemon game is kind of like an actual sort of close to an actual RPG in a way.
00:31:04 Well, yeah, you don't really have choices and it's a railroad,
00:31:07 but it's telling a story and I feel a bit more invested in it than with other games.
00:31:12 I mean, I hear I hear a lot of praise for the story in this game.
00:31:15 So good. The story is not actually good.
00:31:18 Like, yeah, you're completely reasonable for what it is.
00:31:21 Complaining about the amount of cut scenes.
00:31:23 And yeah, I feel like there are more, but a lot of people seem to think
00:31:26 that they're good cut scenes in the story.
00:31:27 Those people are wrong.
00:31:28 And they've been.
00:31:29 They've been. Skull.
00:31:31 What? By their own brain.
00:31:33 They think they're enjoying it.
00:31:35 By far the best team that's ever been in one of these games.
00:31:38 Yes, teams are miles greater than any of the previous teams.
00:31:42 That's not true. You're not thinking clearly.
00:31:44 I really want to get to know Team Rocket.
00:31:46 Team Rocket did nothing. Team Rocket is bull.
00:31:48 Team Rocket is the coolest.
00:31:49 Every Team Rocket guy.
00:31:50 Oh, I sure like hurting Pokemon.
00:31:53 I'm they were just they were just.
00:31:55 You know, when you say it like that, Digi, they actually do sound pretty cool.
00:31:59 Well, all right, I don't I like Team Skull, too.
00:32:02 I think Team Skull is great.
00:32:03 And by the way, punk girl, when she's not wearing her Team Skull outfit,
00:32:06 is probably the hottest Pokemon girl there's ever been.
00:32:09 So I'm big into Team Skull.
00:32:10 They're perfectly great.
00:32:11 Team Skull has so much pathos behind them.
00:32:14 And when you fucking I'm not going to I don't want to spoil it.
00:32:17 This really isn't, by the way, this is not a counter to my point.
00:32:19 This is just something else entirely.
00:32:21 Team Skull is fine.
00:32:22 I have no gripes with them there.
00:32:23 That doesn't have anything to do with the casualization.
00:32:25 Cut scenes.
00:32:26 Like, yeah, but that just is such a.
00:32:28 I mean, I cannot think of a single time in a Pokemon game
00:32:31 until this one where I ever gave a single fuck about anything.
00:32:35 I never cared about any of the characters.
00:32:37 Well, that's your problem.
00:32:38 I thought they all retarded, you know, like when I was growing up,
00:32:41 I was just like fucking mash a through Lance talking about whatever bullshit
00:32:45 he wants you to do at the stupid power plant.
00:32:47 I don't care.
00:32:48 But in this game, I was like, oh, my God, this character, Lily,
00:32:52 she has a fucking arc.
00:32:53 She develops, she changes, and I could see the hints
00:32:57 from the very beginning of how she was going to change.
00:32:59 And I was like, huh, this is an interesting little character.
00:33:01 And then there's like this huge moment of growth.
00:33:04 And I'm like, whoa, this is literally the plot of Killluck.
00:33:06 You don't fucking think Silver develops over the course of Pokemon Gold and Silver.
00:33:10 You're out of your fucking mind.
00:33:11 You don't remember the very end.
00:33:13 At the very end, he's like, wow, you beat me so many fucking times
00:33:18 that maybe I'm doing something wrong and Lily changes exactly once
00:33:21 at like three quarters through the game.
00:33:23 No, no, she changes gradually when she realizes
00:33:26 a whole bunch of different things at the beginning.
00:33:27 She's like, I never had to.
00:33:29 She's like telling you, oh, I've never dressed myself before.
00:33:32 You know, my mom's always picked up my clothes for me.
00:33:34 And then every time you go to like a clothes shop, she's like, you know,
00:33:37 maybe I'm going to try on something different.
00:33:39 Maybe I'll try something new.
00:33:40 And then at one point we buy her an outfit that's already established.
00:33:43 That doesn't happen over the course of the game.
00:33:45 That's just from the start.
00:33:46 No, she likes shopping, but she's never bought her own clothes before.
00:33:49 With the first time she buys something, she's like, oh, I bought this outfit
00:33:52 even though I'm sure I don't have the courage to wear it.
00:33:55 Yeah. And she won't put it on until after like a big character moment.
00:33:59 And then she gets it. And then we're done.
00:34:00 And then she's the same character the rest of the game.
00:34:01 All of my only point, she's fine.
00:34:03 I like it. She's not bad.
00:34:05 You guys are just making it out like this is so much better than the other games.
00:34:09 And that's I don't even have an opinion because I haven't played that far.
00:34:13 Nate, I hate I hate listening to you about this.
00:34:16 You're dumb. You're dumb.
00:34:17 You're about to fucking cut scenes.
00:34:19 You've been you've been through a million cut scenes.
00:34:21 And I think the solution that will make everybody happy
00:34:24 is just make the cut scenes fucking skippable.
00:34:27 So if we're retired like this stupid shit, you can watch it.
00:34:32 And if you just want to kill some Pokemon like me and Ben,
00:34:34 you can just go fucking kill Pokemon.
00:34:36 Yes, I mean, this is not being able to skip cut scenes
00:34:40 is one of the biggest problems I hate.
00:34:42 I hate this is a huge problem with every Nintendo game.
00:34:44 Lack of options.
00:34:45 They for some reason, they just can't get it through there.
00:34:48 Like even if it was just busy, honestly, I wouldn't accept your opinion yourself.
00:34:54 Yeah, I know. Well, OK, well, I would even accept that it was just on the second round.
00:34:59 Like, even if it was just the second time to the game,
00:35:01 if you could skip the cut scenes, like, I mean, I hate that you can't skip them ever.
00:35:05 But like, at least make it so when I go through again,
00:35:08 because the thought of trying to play this game again
00:35:09 and watch 30 minutes of cut scenes at the start and end of the game
00:35:12 is just like, I don't want to do that again.
00:35:14 The other games don't have that.
00:35:16 The other games don't have all that shit.
00:35:17 That's because I have no ties or anything.
00:35:19 But there is there is no way to you.
00:35:22 Oh, God, there's no there's no new game.
00:35:24 Plus and may I remind you all that at the beginning of gold and silver,
00:35:27 you have to walk all the way to the next town to pick up an egg
00:35:32 and then walk all the way back to the previous town
00:35:35 before you can get your running shoes
00:35:37 and before you can really catch any Pokemon.
00:35:39 Yeah, but you still get to play how it takes like 20 fucking minutes.
00:35:43 There's no cut scenes in that whole.
00:35:44 There's well, there's a couple like talk.
00:35:46 Yeah, but it's the worst thing ever.
00:35:48 It's the by far that was made.
00:35:50 That's worse than half an hour of waiting for the game to start.
00:35:52 No, dude, there were so many times as I went back to gold and silver
00:35:56 and I literally just like played through that little segment
00:35:59 and then just gave I was like, I don't you just said that you don't want to play
00:36:01 this one again. So at the worst, it's the same level of bad
00:36:04 from that one game in the game. Yeah, I'm not talking about the same level.
00:36:08 All right. Well, what about I just want to say, OK,
00:36:10 though, Nate, you said we're making out this game is like so much better
00:36:14 than all the other ones. I was actually arguing.
00:36:17 I was actually arguing that all the things you're complaining about
00:36:19 were in the previous games, so it's not like things got worse.
00:36:23 OK, they're just one example of something that is unquestionably better.
00:36:27 I think that stuff is just more of it. Yeah.
00:36:30 But OK, just just this one thing that I think is
00:36:33 and this is when I was going to say like my ideal Pokemon game.
00:36:35 This is what I'm talking about in Pokemon Red and Blue,
00:36:38 everything to do with the story of Mewtwo, which is which is the story of that game.
00:36:43 There's there's, you know, Team Rocket is doing their shit
00:36:45 and and Mewtwo was made and caused problems on Cinnabar Island.
00:36:50 That's pretty much it.
00:36:51 And is all that in the actual narrative of red and blue?
00:36:54 Well, that's the great thing about it.
00:36:56 That's the great thing about you find out that information by going into the
00:36:59 like that the smash up laboratory on Cinnabar Island.
00:37:02 Yeah. And you read the logs and you learn by playing the game voluntarily.
00:37:06 You're not forced into a cut scene where you find out what Mewtwo's
00:37:10 backstory is all the back story elements you can learn that way in X and Y.
00:37:14 You never have nobody tells you about Type Null,
00:37:16 but you can read up all these data files about great if only every part of the story
00:37:21 was like that. It'd be a thousand times.
00:37:22 But there's nothing wrong with a cut scene.
00:37:25 But there's something wrong with a bunch of cut scenes to take a half a run time.
00:37:29 Does every fucking part of every game have to be delivered environmentally?
00:37:33 Does every game have to be some dark souls?
00:37:35 The end thing where you told me you think there's too many cut scenes.
00:37:38 I'm giving you a solution.
00:37:40 I don't even think there's too many cut scenes.
00:37:42 I think no, I think it's pretty long.
00:37:44 I didn't dislike it.
00:37:47 Yeah, I mean, I like the cut scene.
00:37:49 I think I think they're too long, but I had no problem with them.
00:37:51 And like the way the way I played it, like, I mean,
00:37:54 I sat down with the game and played for six straight hours.
00:37:58 And those first 30 minutes very quickly no longer were a factor
00:38:02 because I just, you know, I just kept playing.
00:38:04 And I just thought I was I was glad to be invested in the in the world
00:38:09 and characters because if I'm going to play a game with a lot of story,
00:38:12 I'd like to care about the things that are going on, you know, as I played the game.
00:38:17 It absolutely got much, much better as I played more.
00:38:20 And what I didn't think was a very good start became less and less important.
00:38:23 But that does not. I'm really just I'm emphasizing things
00:38:26 that bothered me a lot at the start that don't really.
00:38:29 I don't think they matter that much over the course of the game.
00:38:32 Like you get less scenes as the game goes on.
00:38:34 I'm just being strongly emphasizing what those points are.
00:38:37 OK, Nate hates cutscenes.
00:38:39 That's it. That's all that's all there is to it.
00:38:41 And that was only part of the game.
00:38:44 Well, whatever. All right, let's move on to something else.
00:38:46 I just think it's really funny to hear this argument
00:38:48 from a fucking Kingdom Hearts fan where you get to start off the first game
00:38:50 spinning you can skip those cutscenes.
00:38:52 You can skip those fucking cutscenes.
00:38:54 Yeah, but you can't skip that stupid race.
00:38:56 Also, they're great.
00:38:57 Hey, guys, do you know what's the story that is delivered through cutscenes?
00:39:02 Like the the NPCs you fight,
00:39:04 sometimes they throw out pokemons in different types of pokeballs.
00:39:07 It's a neat little. Oh, yeah.
00:39:09 Yeah, I haven't heard that before.
00:39:11 Oh, that's been other versions.
00:39:12 The Kahuna's Crabrawler, I think, was in an old.
00:39:15 Or I think all the Kahuna's Pokemon were in.
00:39:17 But it just rounded NPCs like some guy used, I think, a premier ball.
00:39:21 I don't remember for the collector guys.
00:39:24 The collector guys use premiere balls for their body.
00:39:26 I have said before, I love I love getting all my Pokemon
00:39:30 in different colored balls and just they all have like a look at my one guy.
00:39:33 My starter here is in his little red ball.
00:39:35 Oh, this one, I found this diglet in a cave.
00:39:37 He's in a little black, green, deep ball or whatever.
00:39:40 Oh, and this fish is in a dive ball.
00:39:42 It's great. Yeah, your your Pokemon should all be in blue balls, Ben.
00:39:45 That's for sure.
00:39:46 Hey.
00:39:49 Got him.
00:39:50 Yeah, I really, yeah, I really like surfing.
00:39:52 Really like all those water Pokemon.
00:39:54 Can we talk about the elimination of gyms?
00:39:57 Yes, we can really in elimination.
00:40:00 It was just. Oh, no. Oh, no, it absolutely was.
00:40:02 This was a big deal.
00:40:04 Well, I don't know.
00:40:05 It's exactly the same.
00:40:06 Oh, how far are you in the game?
00:40:07 I mean, how many trials have you done?
00:40:09 I've done two and I'm back to the third one.
00:40:12 I mean, I know they're very different.
00:40:14 I'm pretty much completely spoiled on where it goes with it.
00:40:17 I don't think Mumki is.
00:40:18 I am not. Yeah.
00:40:20 So, I mean, I'm not.
00:40:22 It seems to be the instead of trainers in the places,
00:40:25 you just fired a bunch of the Pokemon of the type that the crystal is.
00:40:30 The just like it would be in a gym
00:40:32 and then you fight the big main one and then you beat him
00:40:35 and then you get the same.
00:40:36 The the Cajunas are basically gym leader battles.
00:40:40 The the trial leaders, I guess, are the trial captains are to kind of,
00:40:45 I guess, I know it didn't it didn't feel like it with them as much.
00:40:49 Yeah, well, you don't really like like, I mean, the trials of them,
00:40:53 the new versions of gyms, but the actual gym leaders are more like the Cajunas.
00:40:57 It's such they basically made two different strands of
00:41:00 I've always thought the Cajunas would like the elite four
00:41:04 and there's one elite four on each island.
00:41:06 Well, yeah, but I mean, the elite four ordinarily would not be fought on each island.
00:41:10 It seems like you fight the trial captain, then do the trial,
00:41:16 then trial captain and then sometimes you don't find a lot of trial captains.
00:41:20 Yeah, I didn't I didn't fight the water one.
00:41:22 Fight Elima. That's like the only one.
00:41:24 Well, you fight a couple of them.
00:41:25 I think I don't know.
00:41:27 The point is, I think Elima is the only one they train the totem Pokemon
00:41:31 and they that's their place that to show how good they are at making the Pokemon really fast.
00:41:35 And the totem fights are cool because they're like you have to fight.
00:41:38 You usually have to fight two Pokemon at once and it makes it a much more strategic.
00:41:41 Oh, God, the two at one.
00:41:42 We have to talk about that.
00:41:43 You always have to fight two at once.
00:41:45 But yeah, it makes it man.
00:41:47 The most hilarious fight I ever had is against the electric one.
00:41:51 And like, yeah, I had like only one Pokemon that had enough resistance
00:41:56 to deal with it, which is my sandy gas and like he couldn't do it.
00:41:59 Like it was like he couldn't damage it because it was a flying electric
00:42:03 and it couldn't damage me very much because it was you know, I was a ground type.
00:42:06 So like all I had was to trap it in a fucking sand tomb
00:42:11 and like just wait, wait out turn after turn until it fucking died.
00:42:15 And it took forever, but it was so funny because he couldn't hurt me.
00:42:19 And it was just like this battle of attrition where he just kept increasing
00:42:22 his speed or whatever it was totally pointless.
00:42:25 Well, you know, I love I liked one aspect of those of the trials.
00:42:30 And that was the totem fights were cool.
00:42:33 There's the buffed up Pokemon that's stronger than normal.
00:42:35 And he summons guys to fight him.
00:42:36 That felt like kind of like a proper boss fight.
00:42:38 I didn't enjoy that aspect, but there was a huge problem.
00:42:41 I do like I do.
00:42:43 I do like the idea that a Pokemon can be a boss battle.
00:42:47 Yeah, I don't know if I'm that impressed really with the totem Pokemon.
00:42:51 I don't I don't think they're that interesting, honestly.
00:42:55 I mean, the most interesting thing about them is that they summon,
00:42:58 which is not even a thing that's unique to them.
00:42:59 Well, see, see, and that's that's the thing.
00:43:01 OK, so when I when I did the first trial
00:43:03 and there was a summoning thing for the totem in that, you know,
00:43:06 in that area in the trial area, I was like, oh, that's cool.
00:43:08 This is a challenging place.
00:43:09 So I like the concept, but I think they could do it better.
00:43:12 The problem for me is that that happens outside of trial areas
00:43:16 and was probably the most frustrating thing just about doing normal battles.
00:43:20 When I'm trying to not even when I'm just trying to catch something.
00:43:23 Yeah, I'm trying to catch something to keep so many guys
00:43:25 and you can't throw a Pokeball.
00:43:26 It's a nightmare. It's a nightmare.
00:43:28 It is a kind of a nightmare.
00:43:29 I haven't had a really terrible experience with it, except for one time
00:43:33 where none of my Pokemon were particularly effective against this rock guy.
00:43:38 Yeah, well, I think they were.
00:43:39 But I was just fighting it with one Pokemon.
00:43:42 I was just trying to get it low enough so I could catch it.
00:43:45 And then you summon another one.
00:43:47 And the worst thing about it is that they can summon ones
00:43:50 as soon as you kill the second.
00:43:52 Yeah, they don't even have to like use a turn or anything.
00:43:54 I mean, I think it's a cool like idea to have that happen,
00:43:58 but it just happens way too often.
00:43:59 It's like every wild Pokemon battle.
00:44:01 If you get them to low health because you're trying to catch them,
00:44:03 they're going to summon something.
00:44:04 I was keeping track.
00:44:05 Turn into this fucking I had a record of five times.
00:44:09 I had a Pokemon at one HP.
00:44:10 I was used false white.
00:44:11 It was like stunned five turns in a fucking row.
00:44:14 I want to kill the enemy.
00:44:15 It's summoned another one.
00:44:17 Five turns that that's the thing about it is that it's also meant
00:44:21 to be a method for catching better Pokemon because the more they summon,
00:44:24 the higher the IVs will be of those Pokemon.
00:44:27 And we can get like if you want to have a really solid team,
00:44:30 you just keep sidechaining those things until you finally get like
00:44:34 and they'll also summon like their own evolved form sometimes or like Pokemon.
00:44:38 There's a lot of Pokemon that can only be caught that way.
00:44:41 Well, all right, that's cool.
00:44:42 But it's an issue of balancing.
00:44:44 And I don't think the balance is correct for that.
00:44:46 No, there's too much of it.
00:44:47 But like wouldn't it be great if that only happened in like trial areas
00:44:51 or just some designated place?
00:44:53 Yeah, that would be cool if it only happened for cool Pokemon.
00:44:57 All right.
00:44:58 I think, you know, I actually think it's kind of cool
00:45:01 that you can catch Pokemon with their hidden abilities that way.
00:45:04 But I don't like that some Pokemon can only be encountered at all that way.
00:45:08 I think that means that a lot of people, myself included,
00:45:11 would go through the game just without seeing a lot of Pokemon.
00:45:15 Like I think that is a huge issue.
00:45:17 I think Toxopex can only be encountered
00:45:20 if you have like all these long ass chain battles
00:45:23 where they summon a series of Pokemon.
00:45:25 And like I think there's a high probability
00:45:27 that that just might never happen and I might never see a Toxopex.
00:45:31 I'd beat the game if that were a Sabeline.
00:45:34 Hippini.
00:45:35 Yeah, Hippini.
00:45:36 On the first island, you can only get it by when it calls
00:45:41 like when baby Pokemon call for help like Bonsley or Pichu.
00:45:45 Yeah, or AigliBuff.
00:45:47 I mean, I guess it was the case before that you could go through an area
00:45:51 and never encounter certain Pokemon.
00:45:53 I mean, I don't know.
00:45:54 It's just a little extreme.
00:45:55 I think there's too many of them.
00:45:57 Something is hiding something esoteric, like a hidden ability.
00:46:00 I like that.
00:46:01 I think hiding the Pokemon period is too much.
00:46:04 I mean, it's always been one of the cool things about trying to catch
00:46:08 all the Pokemon in a game is that they usually have whatever new mechanic.
00:46:12 There's some Pokemon that you can only catch through that mechanic.
00:46:14 But this is like way extreme.
00:46:16 Like there's a lot of Pokemon you can only catch that way.
00:46:18 There should not have been.
00:46:19 I think it's yeah, they overdid it.
00:46:21 It's funny to me.
00:46:22 I actually I kind of disagree with you guys.
00:46:24 I'm actually inclined to be more charitable about this
00:46:26 because I'm a man who loves the grind as as you all know.
00:46:29 And I don't really mind like if you go through the through the game
00:46:33 just playing normally, which I just finished this morning.
00:46:35 And I never find Pokemon.
00:46:37 That's fine because I'll really enjoy if I'm inclined to go back
00:46:40 and try to fill my Pokedex, taking the pains to go and find them out
00:46:44 through whatever method it makes me.
00:46:47 It makes me appreciate it more when I have to work hard to get a Pokemon.
00:46:50 You know, I mean, that's yeah.
00:46:52 That's the part I do like is that like sometimes you're trying to catch a
00:46:55 Pokemon and it becomes like, all right, now I really got to like,
00:46:58 you know, put a lot more effort into strategizing how I'm going to do this.
00:47:01 But it's just too fucking much.
00:47:03 There's 300 Pokemon in this game.
00:47:05 You know, I don't want to do this in every fucking battle.
00:47:07 So just recently, I was I was having a bit of an issue with the fee bass
00:47:11 in that one, the only one place that it can spawn in that in the water trial area.
00:47:18 And you get the fishing rod and it seems like the first time you see it,
00:47:23 it's like a high probability.
00:47:24 But if you miss your chance like I did, it drops drastically.
00:47:28 And then I was just sitting there for two hours fishing
00:47:30 because I hated the idea that I let it get away.
00:47:33 I didn't realize how rare it was.
00:47:34 But don't you feel great when you finally catch it?
00:47:37 I don't know, because well, there's a thing with that,
00:47:39 because when I get fucked by a random number generator enough,
00:47:43 yeah, finally winning after, you know, finally getting the thing.
00:47:47 There's a threshold beyond which I don't feel as good.
00:47:50 I just feel Pokemon I sigh.
00:47:53 And I'm like, finally.
00:47:54 And I was like, when you fought, Pokemon on every level
00:47:58 is just all about that RNG.
00:47:59 Yeah. And I don't love RNG.
00:48:01 Like like something like in King of Hearts,
00:48:03 I haven't been getting better at the fights lately.
00:48:05 I lately I have been playing lots and lots of Pokemon showdown.
00:48:09 And you just you just have to learn to love the RNG.
00:48:13 It's the only you have to you have to accept and embrace the RNG.
00:48:17 That's like a Dark Souls meme.
00:48:20 Hey, guys, something random.
00:48:21 Did you all get your event much like Stingy?
00:48:24 Yes, Rolex has been a staple of my team.
00:48:26 I did. I did not get it because it seemed cheap.
00:48:29 I thought I thought I'm never going to use it.
00:48:31 It's perfect to I caught one.
00:48:33 Metronome is lots of fun.
00:48:36 It's just it's hilarious.
00:48:37 No, it's cheap.
00:48:39 Guys, his attack would definitely be cheating for Ben's Nuzlocke.
00:48:43 He can't over as you pancake is the coolest attack in all.
00:48:46 Oh, hey, you know what?
00:48:47 Let's talk about that real quick.
00:48:48 Z moves. I think I think I just completely love them.
00:48:51 And they're they're basically final smashes for Pokemon.
00:48:54 And I just don't like that they have long cut scenes.
00:48:57 That's the only thing I don't know.
00:48:58 You can only use them so much.
00:48:59 I do love you don't love final smashes.
00:49:01 Yeah, you know, okay.
00:49:03 Yeah, I think I think they're balanced enough
00:49:07 using one per battle, you know, seems reasonable.
00:49:09 I don't think you could use them all the time.
00:49:11 Then you would feel like you need to use them all the time.
00:49:14 And then you'd be terrible that they were really long.
00:49:16 But if you're like, you know, you're fighting a Cajun and you're like,
00:49:19 all right, they got half the health.
00:49:21 I can't do it.
00:49:22 Well, explosion.
00:49:23 Z moves are Z moves are good.
00:49:26 Like they're always good to use.
00:49:28 So like strategically, you probably should use them every single battle you're in,
00:49:32 which is well, I'm not going to spoil.
00:49:36 You can usually kill them in one hit if you're good.
00:49:39 Mom, can you say I'm not going to spoil anything?
00:49:41 But the battle between me and Ben, the Z moves are some of the
00:49:44 I mean, it's the best fucking parts of the video.
00:49:46 The Z moves did the Z moves did become.
00:49:49 Yeah, I think they're a lot of fun.
00:49:51 That's cool. That's what's cool about like.
00:49:52 Yeah, acts like in the city in that case, in that case,
00:49:57 the the cutscene definitely added something.
00:50:00 Yeah, that was fun.
00:50:03 It makes it more anime.
00:50:05 Yeah, it's like it's like me and Ben were actually fighting in an anime.
00:50:08 It was awesome. Yeah.
00:50:09 Yeah, we like we called out our attacks and then we charged them up and released them.
00:50:14 Did you do the pose as well?
00:50:15 Yeah, you better have done that dance.
00:50:17 Oh, in real life, we do in real life.
00:50:19 Yeah, yeah, yeah, we had face cam on and everything.
00:50:22 Wait, OK, Generation 8, Generation 8,
00:50:26 keep the Z moves, but have a motion controller built into the DS.
00:50:29 You have to actually perform the dance.
00:50:32 If you do it wrong, then the attack doesn't work.
00:50:34 I would be so down.
00:50:35 You know what? Quick, quick, caviar.
00:50:36 One of my biggest problems with this game was that there's a couple times
00:50:39 you get a a Z stone or a Z crystal or whatever,
00:50:43 and then you can just use it without learning the dance.
00:50:45 How the fuck did I learn that dance game?
00:50:46 How the fuck did I do it?
00:50:48 I don't know. That's so shit.
00:50:50 That actually really pisses me off.
00:50:52 Like, they make a big deal about, oh, you have to do the dance to do the thing.
00:50:56 And then sometimes they just ignore that rule.
00:50:59 That sucks.
00:51:00 I would say as often they ignore the rule because there's 20 fucking crystals
00:51:06 and there's only like eight people who teach you dances.
00:51:08 Did you? The first thing I did when I got to end game was go down.
00:51:12 Make up your own dance.
00:51:13 There you go.
00:51:14 Maybe I don't even think the dance is about here.
00:51:17 If you can make up your own dance, then why does why does Ilma have to teach you the dance?
00:51:21 Tradition.
00:51:22 Wait, if there's 18 crystals, surely some of them are the same type,
00:51:26 like same move type, like water.
00:51:29 No, there's actually way more than.
00:51:30 There's 18 types, but then there's like unique.
00:51:33 There's there's Pokemon specific crystals, too.
00:51:36 Oh, fuck.
00:51:37 Forgot about that.
00:51:38 I'll say this much.
00:51:39 I kind of like the Zmos.
00:51:41 Actually, I like them a lot more than I do mega evolution.
00:51:44 Yeah, dog. Yeah.
00:51:46 No, I like I like mega mega evolution.
00:51:48 Yeah, but make a little you grow up and accept it.
00:51:51 Make up a whole thing.
00:51:52 What do you mean they take up a whole thing?
00:51:54 They do they take up a whole move slot?
00:51:57 What? No, no, they take up a turn.
00:51:59 No. OK, forget it.
00:52:01 Then I've never really used them.
00:52:02 I just heard about a man.
00:52:04 Let me tell you, maybe evolution.
00:52:05 Mega evolutions do not take up a turn, you dingus.
00:52:07 They don't. Oh, OK.
00:52:08 Well, I still like it.
00:52:09 But I got through this whole game like Z moves a lot.
00:52:12 And let me tell you, I'm in the end game now.
00:52:13 Well, I went to do a thing in a certain place.
00:52:15 And what do I find?
00:52:16 But the guy's like, hey, congratulations on becoming champion.
00:52:19 How would you like to learn about megas?
00:52:21 And I was like, no, please, we were so close.
00:52:26 Megas are cool.
00:52:27 No, I'm that's it.
00:52:28 I'm a mega I'm a mega fag.
00:52:29 I'm totally on board with megas.
00:52:31 Then you are a mega fag.
00:52:33 I am a mega evolution.
00:52:37 I mean, I know I literally just said that about myself.
00:52:41 Um, I I played the whole game and I never used a single Z move.
00:52:45 What? Oh, yeah, I died all the time.
00:52:51 I can't wipe in this game.
00:52:53 I wonder why the idea of having to like give things to my Pokemon
00:52:58 never been a fan.
00:52:59 Say you don't even give them items.
00:53:01 You've got to micromanage at least a little bit.
00:53:03 Jen, too.
00:53:04 Managing, too.
00:53:06 I hate because I constantly switch Pokemon in and out of my party.
00:53:10 So I've always felt like I have to, like, remove all the items from each guy
00:53:13 and then put them on the next guy in Spanish by the part of the game
00:53:19 where you're on the second island and you've just got to the Royal Rumble.
00:53:22 How many times have you completely wiped?
00:53:23 I'm just curious.
00:53:24 He said ten minutes.
00:53:25 Rumble.
00:53:26 Yeah, I don't know if at all.
00:53:29 Maybe once.
00:53:30 Digi, I got a question for you.
00:53:32 Me and Ben are having a little debate about this.
00:53:34 Do you think when you get thrown into that first Royal Rumble,
00:53:38 if your Pokemon dies in a Nuzlocke, is that is it dead
00:53:41 or does the Royal Rumble not count because it's fucking horses?
00:53:43 I would say it doesn't count because it's so fucking weird.
00:53:46 Yeah, I'd say it doesn't count either.
00:53:48 Ben's trying to kill my Pokemon.
00:53:49 Do you remember the four-way battles?
00:53:52 If the story puts you in a battle, I think it's part of you.
00:53:57 But it's not a real battle because it's three on one pretty much.
00:54:00 And it's the only Pokemon in your party.
00:54:02 So when it dies, it counts as a full party wipe and that's game over.
00:54:06 But someone...
00:54:09 The biggest problem with it is they don't even warn you it's going to happen
00:54:11 and it automatically selects your first Pokemon.
00:54:14 There's all kinds of things that happen without warning.
00:54:16 Yeah, but you don't have your whole team.
00:54:18 It just picks the first guy you've got and then just throws you in.
00:54:22 And it's like you just...
00:54:23 It counts as a full party wipe and that's game over.
00:54:25 I don't know, it sounds like it should maybe
00:54:27 kill the death of that Pokemon but not necessarily.
00:54:30 I mean, I just played...
00:54:32 It does look like community Nuzlocke.
00:54:34 Rumble and it was full.
00:54:36 We are the Nuzlocke community.
00:54:37 It wasn't really three on one.
00:54:40 Like, most of them didn't attack me at all.
00:54:42 They guys, they fucked each other up.
00:54:44 I almost wanted it, but then the thing is that there's one guy
00:54:48 who was constantly using Reflect and he was the only one who was weak type-wise
00:54:52 to my guy.
00:54:53 So I just kept attacking him, but it wasn't working, you know,
00:54:56 and he kept reflecting.
00:54:58 And then eventually I was the first to die in the end.
00:55:02 Like, eventually they all killed me and I was like,
00:55:05 there was no way I could have known this was coming and had the right...
00:55:08 Like, there's no way to know what Pokemon they're gonna have
00:55:11 or what would be the best, you know, front-runner for your party.
00:55:14 So, yeah, it was just kind of...
00:55:16 So I think Ben, for the sake of our Nuzlocke,
00:55:20 I think we should have a vote.
00:55:21 We have six Pokemon experts.
00:55:23 We've all played the game out, but we put it to a vote.
00:55:25 And then the other side, my Pokemon is dead.
00:55:27 But I'm just saying, I'm just saying,
00:55:29 if the vote comes out that it doesn't count,
00:55:32 I'm still gonna do it.
00:55:33 And if I manage to win, I'm gonna pretend that it's legit
00:55:37 and I'm gonna pretend that I'm superior for that reason.
00:55:41 You're probably gonna be superior regardless.
00:55:42 In a Nuzlocke, I don't think it counts as a full party wipe if you die,
00:55:47 but that Pokemon should die.
00:55:48 I kind of agree with that.
00:55:49 God damn it.
00:55:51 Fuck you all.
00:55:52 Let's vote on it.
00:55:53 Let's vote on it right now.
00:55:53 I think it should count for that, yeah.
00:55:55 So, okay, all in favor of it counting for a full game over wipe,
00:55:59 if you lose, say aye.
00:56:02 No votes, okay.
00:56:03 All who think that it should count as the death of that Pokemon,
00:56:06 but not necessarily a full game over, say aye.
00:56:09 Aye.
00:56:10 That's what, four?
00:56:11 And okay, and everyone who thinks it shouldn't count whatsoever, say aye.
00:56:14 Fuck you.
00:56:16 Well, the majority says that Pokemon must die.
00:56:19 Ugh.
00:56:20 I should probably have voted the other way,
00:56:24 because I don't know what you were thinking.
00:56:27 It's fun.
00:56:28 It's fun to die.
00:56:29 It is fun to die.
00:56:30 That's what makes the, that's what makes the game fun.
00:56:31 It's almost like it's fun when a Pokemon game challenges you
00:56:34 and gives you shit and you don't do everything perfectly,
00:56:36 instead of sucking your dick the whole time.
00:56:37 Wow, what a concept.
00:56:38 What is that?
00:56:39 Throwing my level 15 Pokemon that I'm training
00:56:42 into a fucking four way.
00:56:43 That's so fun and challenging, Nate.
00:56:45 Well, you could try not to throw it into a four way.
00:56:47 I didn't know they were gonna throw me
00:56:49 into a fucking battle, hippo.
00:56:50 It's completely out of nowhere.
00:56:52 Wait, is it already happening for you?
00:56:54 Yeah, it fucking happens.
00:56:56 I changed my vote.
00:56:57 You're too late, bitch.
00:56:59 Three to three.
00:57:00 It's time.
00:57:01 What the hell?
00:57:02 And Dizzy counts us too,
00:57:03 because he has more subs than us.
00:57:04 That's bullshit.
00:57:06 Fucking cowards.
00:57:08 You are cowards.
00:57:09 Well, I do make your own decisions.
00:57:11 You guys, since it's a tie,
00:57:12 you two will have to decide amongst yourselves.
00:57:14 You're the ones doing it.
00:57:15 But we both just agreed.
00:57:16 So, hey, what do you know?
00:57:17 Okay, well, there you go.
00:57:18 All right, get out of jail free.
00:57:20 Yeah.
00:57:21 Congratulations, everyone.
00:57:23 Ben's gonna fully make up his mind once he plays it
00:57:26 and whether or not he's gonna play it.
00:57:26 Yeah, that's right.
00:57:28 No, yeah, I have to, let's confer on this after.
00:57:30 Once he sees how bullshit it is,
00:57:32 I think he's gonna agree with me.
00:57:34 Let's wait for me to win,
00:57:36 and then so I can say it definitely should count as a death.
00:57:39 Yeah, that sounds good.
00:57:40 Maybe if your Pokemon died, Momki,
00:57:41 you should just constantly let it have paralysis.
00:57:44 So it's like it's a cripple now.
00:57:46 That's still alive.
00:57:47 Hey, let's talk about something else now.
00:57:50 And I think this was an X and Y.
00:57:52 I can't fucking remember, but I know it was in this game
00:57:54 and it was pretty cool.
00:57:55 Let's talk about dressing up your Pokemon, man.
00:57:58 Maybe all pretty, looking fly is fun.
00:58:01 I loved it.
00:58:01 I loved it.
00:58:02 I mean, I haven't seen that much of it,
00:58:04 but what I've seen, I like,
00:58:05 I want there to be lots more options.
00:58:08 Me too, I'm not dressing up your character, right?
00:58:10 The way you raised that was odd.
00:58:13 You're talking about the Pokemon or the character?
00:58:15 The character.
00:58:16 Oh, that's good.
00:58:17 Well, yeah, I'm on a quest
00:58:20 to find a really nice big summer hat
00:58:22 to go with a white dress.
00:58:23 That's weird.
00:58:25 There's only one big summer hat in the game
00:58:28 and it is $145,000.
00:58:31 I'm getting it.
00:58:31 See, I could buy it now.
00:58:35 That's the one thing I hadn't bought yet that I wanted,
00:58:37 but you can only get it in that mall in the first island.
00:58:40 So you're already past it.
00:58:42 There's nothing more fun than giving yourself a quest
00:58:44 and then going on it and completing it.
00:58:45 Well, the items changed day to day in the shop.
00:58:49 And I'm asking, do they?
00:58:51 Do they do what?
00:58:53 I didn't see the big summer hat when I was first there,
00:58:55 so I guess it gets a lot.
00:58:56 No, there's no changes.
00:58:58 The one in the mall is the super fancy store
00:59:01 where everything's crazy expensive
00:59:03 because there's two stores in the first town.
00:59:04 There's the one that's like the basic bitch store
00:59:07 and then there's the crazy high quality store.
00:59:09 Where the hell is the crazy store?
00:59:11 Are you talking about at the mall?
00:59:12 It's in the mall.
00:59:13 You have to go on the mall.
00:59:14 No, I'm talking about Sun.
00:59:17 There's a mall that me and Ben both completely missed
00:59:19 our first time through the first town.
00:59:21 I'm guessing I missed it as well.
00:59:22 And then we went back and it's, yeah,
00:59:24 it's like a huge, they've got, yeah, it's a big ass mall
00:59:29 and they've got like a clothes store
00:59:31 and then a couple of other little shops.
00:59:32 And then there's like an event area
00:59:34 where like depending on time of day and what day it is,
00:59:37 there's different events going on there.
00:59:39 There's a guy who makes you literally pick up
00:59:40 a bunch of shit and feed it to a grimer.
00:59:43 It's hilarious.
00:59:44 You literally pick up shit.
00:59:45 It's Pokemon shit is everywhere.
00:59:47 And you have to feed it to a grimer.
00:59:49 It's the best.
00:59:51 Shall we?
00:59:52 I like the Alolan grimer
00:59:54 because he's like he ate a cheeseburger
00:59:56 and he's got cheese around his lips.
00:59:57 Maybe that's why, maybe that's why Alolan grimer is-
01:00:00 Actually I like Alolan muck.
01:00:02 That's why who I like.
01:00:03 Maybe that's why Alolan grimer and muck are all gross looking
01:00:06 because they eat poop unlike regular grimmers.
01:00:08 Well, yeah, that's, it's established in this game.
01:00:11 Well, grimmers in the previous generations ate like sludge
01:00:16 and like industrial waste.
01:00:17 And now they just eat human trash
01:00:19 because there's not enough waste.
01:00:21 There's not enough industrialization in Alola
01:00:23 for them to eat.
01:00:24 I feel that's why he has the yellow
01:00:26 because I just assumed it was cheese from a cheeseburger.
01:00:30 Yeah, they also eat poop.
01:00:31 That's pretty fucking disgusting.
01:00:33 But doesn't muck have like diamonds in its mouth?
01:00:37 Maybe.
01:00:38 He's got like, he's got like these like
01:00:39 crystalline looking stones for teeth or something.
01:00:42 Could be glass shards or something.
01:00:44 Yeah, it could be glass.
01:00:45 You never know, you never know.
01:00:47 But anyway, let's talk about forms and how cool they are.
01:00:50 Grimer, when you rub them, your hands goes all sticky
01:00:53 and it's like, it's real funny.
01:00:55 I've got to try it.
01:00:56 I've got to try it.
01:00:57 Who would ever pet that disgusting sack of garbage?
01:01:00 I'd never touch it.
01:01:01 He's gross, but I love the fact that they added that.
01:01:03 I've got to take my, I've got to take my little comb
01:01:05 and just gently, just gently clean off
01:01:07 my little pile of, of my little pile of garbage.
01:01:11 My little piece of living feces.
01:01:12 So let me, yeah, let me just ask guys,
01:01:14 does anyone have a problem at all with the Pokemon forms?
01:01:17 Cause I think I pretty much just love them across the board.
01:01:19 What do you mean forms?
01:01:20 I mean, Alolan form versus Kanto and you know, the other.
01:01:22 Some of them suck.
01:01:24 Well, they can like, okay, Persian is a nightmare.
01:01:27 Persian is a nightmare.
01:01:28 There's no doubt about it.
01:01:29 I don't really like Alolan Dugtrio,
01:01:32 even though I think he's funny.
01:01:34 Yeah, I don't get the, I don't get it.
01:01:37 As stupid as Persian looks,
01:01:38 I think it's a thousand times better
01:01:40 than the original Persian.
01:01:41 What?
01:01:42 I mean, Cat's Persian was boring and stupid
01:01:46 and I never cared about it.
01:01:47 This is not an upgrade.
01:01:48 This is a downgrade.
01:01:49 This is hilarious.
01:01:50 This is a great downgrade.
01:01:51 Do you not think that it looks like a one piece character?
01:01:54 I think it looks like a one piece character.
01:01:56 Okay, but that's not always good.
01:01:58 Oh guys, we lost Mage.
01:01:59 Where'd Mage go?
01:02:00 She was triggered by my hatred of Persian.
01:02:02 I'm sorry, Mage.
01:02:04 Forgive me.
01:02:05 Oh yeah.
01:02:06 I think the original Persian looks like a normal cat.
01:02:09 Kept her recording.
01:02:10 I hope she, yeah.
01:02:12 She's a big girl.
01:02:12 She can take care of herself.
01:02:14 Well, anyway.
01:02:15 We'll see how that plays out.
01:02:17 Yeah, I think forms are cool.
01:02:18 And I mean, I've recently found,
01:02:21 I guess I won't say it because I want to spoil you guys.
01:02:22 Oh, I like fat face, Rattacate.
01:02:25 Oh, I love fat Rattacate.
01:02:27 No, I don't.
01:02:28 Cool.
01:02:28 Well, you know, I kind of like Alolan Rattacate.
01:02:30 I do not like Alolan Rattata.
01:02:32 He is stupid enough.
01:02:33 Rattata is always in every universe,
01:02:35 every timeline.
01:02:36 Rattata is a piece of shit.
01:02:37 No, well, I mean, I don't mind the,
01:02:40 they just gave him a mustache.
01:02:42 It's so stupid.
01:02:43 Like there's no substantive change.
01:02:46 My biggest problem with the Alolan forms
01:02:50 is that there's not nearly enough of them
01:02:52 and there are still old fucking Pokemon,
01:02:55 like Caterpie in this game.
01:02:57 Yeah, there's no business being there.
01:02:58 Yeah, there needed to be way more.
01:03:00 It should have been,
01:03:01 it should have been every old Pokemon is different here.
01:03:03 I mean, do you guys feel,
01:03:05 it's going to be from Gen one.
01:03:06 It should have been different.
01:03:07 Cause like it kind of implies the game.
01:03:09 Hi, sorry, internet.
01:03:10 Just did your, did your, did your recording survive?
01:03:13 Yeah, my recording was just the internet.
01:03:16 Yeah, it's kind of implied throughout the game
01:03:18 that Alola is like closer to Kanto
01:03:21 and that there's like a lot of immigration
01:03:22 between the two and Kanto is like kind of important.
01:03:25 So I feel like it made sense
01:03:27 whether there'd be lots of Kanto Pokemon,
01:03:28 but they should all have different forms.
01:03:30 I should not in any Pokemon game ever
01:03:33 have to catch into the fucking Caterpie
01:03:35 and then, and have a butterfree.
01:03:36 That's not even any different.
01:03:37 Like, I mean, even in X and Y,
01:03:39 they made their own bug Pokemon
01:03:40 and it evolved into a butterfly
01:03:42 that had four different forms.
01:03:44 It was like different depending on where you were.
01:03:46 That's cool.
01:03:47 Why was that not the case here with butterfree?
01:03:49 Well, I mean, I, I feel you on that.
01:03:51 That, that's a, that's a fair point,
01:03:52 but let me ask you guys something else.
01:03:54 Do you feel it all?
01:03:55 I feel a bit of this.
01:03:56 Like these are kind of a cop out
01:03:58 to avoid having to put in the work to make new Pokemon.
01:04:01 This is sort of a, the easy way.
01:04:03 I think they are kind of an effort saving measure,
01:04:06 but they're one that I'm okay with.
01:04:08 Yeah.
01:04:09 I don't, I don't like it.
01:04:10 I mean, I'm sorry for them.
01:04:11 I wouldn't say Alola forms are bit just like
01:04:13 Digglet is basically just the same with hair.
01:04:16 Yeah.
01:04:17 Digglet is lazy as fuck.
01:04:18 Digglet's obviously meant to be a joke.
01:04:20 He doesn't even have a metal nose.
01:04:21 Even when you get,
01:04:22 when you get into battles with him,
01:04:24 have you noticed that when you fight
01:04:26 Doug Trio sometimes, then it like,
01:04:28 it has like this dramatic camera shot on it.
01:04:31 Like, like all these like action lines show up
01:04:32 and it's like, would you like fight one?
01:04:35 And well, I mean, I do see that when you're in battle,
01:04:38 like the camera does pan around and do shots like that.
01:04:40 No, no, no.
01:04:41 I mean, when you first get into the battle
01:04:43 and like it reveals Doug Trio,
01:04:44 then like sometimes it did like a weird dramatic,
01:04:48 like look at this fucking thing.
01:04:50 Like.
01:04:51 I don't know, man.
01:04:52 Are you sure that it's just a normal battle?
01:04:54 Well, whatever.
01:04:55 I'm not sure that's unique.
01:04:56 What do you guys think of the Alolan form?
01:04:58 Maybe that could be like a,
01:04:59 maybe that's like an evolved form special look at this.
01:05:02 I have no idea.
01:05:03 Monkey, what were you saying?
01:05:04 Yeah, but what do you guys think of the Alolan form
01:05:06 of Ben Saint where like they have a new militarized skin
01:05:09 and he thinks he's like a general and stuff?
01:05:10 Not a fan.
01:05:11 I think it's pretty fucking stupid.
01:05:13 I've really not.
01:05:14 It's a form change before I was a petty terrorist
01:05:17 and now I'm a petty dictator.
01:05:20 Yeah, like Fidel Castro.
01:05:23 That's like a tight change.
01:05:24 The pettiness is a constant.
01:05:27 Oh, rest in peace, Fidel Castro, my comrade.
01:05:29 Did he die?
01:05:30 He died fucking today.
01:05:32 Whoa, why are we doing a PCP about that?
01:05:36 Holy shit.
01:05:37 Wow, I had no fucking idea.
01:05:39 What happens when you guys sleep until 3 p.m.?
01:05:41 Yeah, I didn't know that Fidel Castro was alive
01:05:44 until today when I found out he was no longer alive.
01:05:47 I didn't know who Fidel Castro was.
01:05:49 He let Raul run things for a while, but he was still alive.
01:05:52 But he's like 90 years old.
01:05:54 Yeah, he's an old ass bitch.
01:05:55 Well, rest in peace, my friend.
01:05:57 My comrade.
01:05:58 You'll be partying with Che soon up there.
01:06:00 My friends, here.
01:06:02 My friend, who up there?
01:06:04 Che, come on.
01:06:05 Okay, okay, I won't spoil anything,
01:06:07 but what I've heard mostly from you, Digi,
01:06:11 about like, how do I say it?
01:06:17 The sort of Alolan analogy,
01:06:19 like the Alolan version of the Pokemon League is awesome.
01:06:24 Oh yeah, it's the coolest thing ever.
01:06:26 Everything I have heard about that is great.
01:06:29 The Pokemon League is a thousand times better
01:06:31 than ever before.
01:06:32 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
01:06:33 Okay, I really, maybe this isn't the right place
01:06:36 to talk about it, but I really want to hear these reasons,
01:06:38 because I don't know why you think that.
01:06:42 First of all, there's the context of like, why it exists.
01:06:45 Right, I got you on that.
01:06:47 I got you on that.
01:06:47 And then there's just how it plays out.
01:06:50 You know about what you get to do
01:06:52 after you beat the Pokemon League, if you fight it again?
01:06:53 Yes, it's amazing.
01:06:55 No, okay, I only beat it once, so I'll go do that.
01:06:57 I don't know if this is considered a spoiler, so.
01:06:59 Yeah, it would be a total spoiler.
01:07:01 Do you think so?
01:07:02 I'm gonna go do it immediately.
01:07:03 Yes, I do.
01:07:04 Don't tell me.
01:07:05 You say it's cool, I'll go do it.
01:07:06 Guys, Nuzlocke's end after you beat the Pokemon League,
01:07:08 in my mind, so you can spoil what happens post-game.
01:07:10 I don't give a fuck.
01:07:11 I don't really think of it as a spoiler.
01:07:13 It's just, I'm telling you, I don't want to know.
01:07:15 You say it's cool, but guys, I won't go do it.
01:07:18 Maybe it won't be as cool as you think it will
01:07:20 until I fuck, like.
01:07:21 No, no.
01:07:21 You're gonna go through all the trouble
01:07:23 of being in the Pokemon League,
01:07:23 and be like, that's all it was?
01:07:25 Fuck you, Digi.
01:07:26 No, I already know, and I know that if you tell me.
01:07:28 You get to date me, too, okay?
01:07:30 You're like, yeah, I wish I did, you know that.
01:07:32 You're gonna date me, too?
01:07:33 Spoiling.
01:07:35 Do I spy Dan Green?
01:07:37 Do I spy?
01:07:38 Oh my God, he loves this one.
01:07:41 Well, fuck.
01:07:42 Whatever, it's cool.
01:07:44 That's exciting, and I'll go do that,
01:07:46 and I'm looking forward to whatever it is
01:07:47 without my expectations to I.
01:07:49 So, cool.
01:07:50 Awesome, I'll do that.
01:07:52 I guess we need to talk about Ultra Beasts.
01:07:55 You know, we don't have to talk about anything,
01:07:58 because it's supposed to be a general Pokemon podcast,
01:08:00 and not a sudden note.
01:08:02 I don't actually have anything to say
01:08:04 about Ultra Beasts, because I haven't encountered any.
01:08:06 What's Ultra Beasts?
01:08:08 I mean, it's weird.
01:08:09 I have been in the game now,
01:08:11 and Ultra Beasts were only relevant at one time,
01:08:14 and I'm doing a thing now that has something
01:08:16 to do with them.
01:08:17 I don't know what's going on.
01:08:19 I don't know where the mission is catching Ultra Beasts.
01:08:23 Are they mostly a post-game thing?
01:08:25 Yeah, they're mostly post-game.
01:08:26 Like, I mean, they're relevant.
01:08:27 I'm glad.
01:08:28 The story is kind of based around them,
01:08:31 but you only really interact with them post-game.
01:08:33 I mean, that's weird.
01:08:34 Okay, because I don't really want
01:08:35 to interact with them very much.
01:08:37 Okay, yeah, let's just talk about them design-wise.
01:08:40 I mean, it's kind of important.
01:08:41 If they are going to be captured like regular Pokemon,
01:08:44 and we just have them in balls,
01:08:46 that seems very strange to me,
01:08:48 because they are not like normal Pokemon,
01:08:50 but if we just like maybe.
01:08:51 You mean Legendaries?
01:08:52 Yeah.
01:08:53 They don't look like, like, look at that muscle dude.
01:08:54 You know, he does not look like a normal Pokemon.
01:08:57 Ultra Beasts are pretty fucking different,
01:08:59 but they're also like from another dimension, so.
01:09:01 Right, it makes sense.
01:09:02 I don't know what this is.
01:09:04 Well, you'll find out when you get later into the game,
01:09:07 and we're going to stop talking.
01:09:08 I can't wait.
01:09:09 Yeah, okay, okay.
01:09:12 I guess I feel okay about them.
01:09:14 I don't know whatever.
01:09:15 You know who I like?
01:09:17 I wish I could say more,
01:09:19 but I guess I shouldn't for Star Wise,
01:09:20 but Kukui is cool.
01:09:22 I like the professor.
01:09:23 Yes.
01:09:24 I like him a lot.
01:09:24 He is the coolest professor.
01:09:25 He is probably the coolest professor.
01:09:26 He's the sexiest professor.
01:09:29 And I really like, I don't know if you guys have gotten this,
01:09:31 but it's implied later that he trains his body really hard
01:09:35 because he's a move guy.
01:09:36 He's into moves.
01:09:37 That's his thing as a professor.
01:09:38 We also know everything about moves.
01:09:39 So he has trained himself
01:09:40 so that he can endure being hit by moves
01:09:42 so he can learn about them.
01:09:44 How badass is that?
01:09:45 That's fucking legit.
01:09:46 I caught my fucking Dragonite,
01:09:51 and I told him to outrage on me,
01:09:53 and he wouldn't stop.
01:09:54 He spent three entire turns just tearing me to fucking shred.
01:09:58 Luckily, I had my Alomomola nearby
01:10:02 to cast Wish on me to repair my shattered body.
01:10:05 Yes, Wish that you wouldn't be crushed.
01:10:08 Wish that I wasn't dead, and it worked.
01:10:11 So here I am.
01:10:12 When you said your Dragonite was using outrage on you,
01:10:14 I thought you were gonna say it started a Tumblr account.
01:10:17 Oh, good.
01:10:18 Is that like a fat dragon joke?
01:10:20 Sure.
01:10:21 No, it's because he was outraged by Trump being elected.
01:10:25 Sure.
01:10:27 Make my joke funnier for me.
01:10:29 I'm envisioning that, you know,
01:10:30 that butter dragon thing that was in Undertale?
01:10:33 Oh, God.
01:10:34 Yeah.
01:10:35 Yeah.
01:10:37 So everybody.
01:10:38 He's got some outrage.
01:10:39 I know half of you haven't gotten very far in this game,
01:10:42 but what would you say is your favorite new Pokemon?
01:10:45 I've seen all the Pokemon.
01:10:47 Definitely Grubbin.
01:10:48 Grubbin is really good.
01:10:50 Grubbin is really good.
01:10:51 Grubbin so much.
01:10:52 He's fucking adorable.
01:10:54 Yeah, he's kind of cute,
01:10:55 but Raul is way cuter.
01:10:56 His evolved form is really cool.
01:10:59 Little bird.
01:11:00 Owl bird started.
01:11:00 I like male Primarina.
01:11:03 I bet you do.
01:11:04 Primarina is cool.
01:11:05 Primarina is the coolest design of the three.
01:11:08 I don't know what that is.
01:11:09 No, no, no.
01:11:10 The grass final is by far the coolest.
01:11:12 Have you guys tried Petty?
01:11:13 If you actually play with the grass final,
01:11:15 like he is, like his moves and everything,
01:11:17 he looks, first of all, he looks cooler from behind.
01:11:19 So like when you've got him on your team,
01:11:21 you're like, yeah, yeah.
01:11:22 And then you fucking use the arrow move
01:11:24 and you're like, yeah.
01:11:25 Yeah, that's the best.
01:11:26 He swings anointing, though.
01:11:27 Guys, when he pulls the two little dangly leaves
01:11:30 on the dangle down from his neck,
01:11:32 his mask thing closes because it's a fucking hoodie.
01:11:36 He's wearing a grass hoodie.
01:11:38 How sick is that?
01:11:40 It's pretty sick.
01:11:41 It's the best.
01:11:42 It's pretty sick.
01:11:43 It's the best.
01:11:44 I'll give you that much.
01:11:45 All right.
01:11:46 I also like Mimikyu,
01:11:47 but I don't think everyone likes Mimikyu.
01:11:49 Yeah, Mimikyu's great.
01:11:51 I mean, Mimikyu's the best way
01:11:53 to do another fucking Pikachu for sure.
01:11:56 But he didn't already.
01:11:57 Another Pikachu was.
01:11:58 Yeah, there's another new one this game, too.
01:12:00 Wait, like aside from Mimikyu?
01:12:03 Yeah, there's like this little fat mouse thing.
01:12:05 It's like a Hedgehog.
01:12:06 It was a Pikachu original.
01:12:08 A Hedgehog.
01:12:10 I don't know.
01:12:10 He has a long mask thing.
01:12:12 Super Sonic.
01:12:13 And it's like a steel electric type.
01:12:16 Wait, Tota Gamaru?
01:12:18 Yeah.
01:12:19 Wait, is he new this game?
01:12:20 Yeah.
01:12:21 Oh, he's...
01:12:23 I mean, I don't understand the point
01:12:25 because we already had a steel electric,
01:12:27 but I guess he's a fast steel electric.
01:12:29 The point is they need a new Pikachu
01:12:31 because it's a new Pokemon game.
01:12:32 God, why do they do that?
01:12:34 It's so stupid.
01:12:35 I don't know.
01:12:36 They always got a bird and they've always got a grub.
01:12:38 One thing they're not always annoyed about
01:12:40 is like the insistence that Pikachu is the best one
01:12:43 and he's got better voice acting in this game.
01:12:45 And it's always about Pikachu and I don't care.
01:12:49 Pikachu's voice acting in this game is a trainer, too.
01:12:52 I actually...
01:12:52 Oh, really?
01:12:53 Wait, is it a trainer?
01:12:54 There's a trainer you can fight in the graveyard
01:12:56 named Ikue and she only has a Pikachu.
01:13:01 And when you beat her, she's like,
01:13:02 Pika, pika!
01:13:04 I remember that.
01:13:05 Oh, well, she is the voice actress of Pikachu.
01:13:08 That's a cute reference, way to go.
01:13:09 And she's standing over a grave of a Pikachu also,
01:13:12 which I, oh my God, what does this mean?
01:13:14 The symbolism was haunting me.
01:13:16 Dude, what if she had just been fired from the role,
01:13:18 standing over the grave of Pikachu?
01:13:19 That would have been a half of the play.
01:13:21 She says like, I'm speaking in the language
01:13:23 of this dead Pikachu that I'm here to visit or something.
01:13:27 Yeah, she's channeling it.
01:13:29 She's definitely the most recognized voice actress
01:13:32 in the world, because it's the same voice
01:13:34 for Pikachu in every country.
01:13:35 They never change it, you know?
01:13:37 So we all know Ikue Atani as a voice Pikachu.
01:13:42 I heard a story from a friend of mine
01:13:45 who knew someone who met her.
01:13:48 This was in like 2001
01:13:50 and apparently she like has a tick
01:13:52 of just like inserting pikas into her speech.
01:13:55 Oh my God.
01:13:56 She's broken.
01:13:56 She's been fully broken.
01:13:58 That was only four, that was only like four or five years
01:14:01 into Pokemon being out.
01:14:02 Imagine it must be like now.
01:14:04 Her mind would be absolutely shattered.
01:14:06 She's yellow.
01:14:07 She's even yellower than she was before.
01:14:09 Sorry.
01:14:12 I want her to get surgical alterations,
01:14:14 become that which you love.
01:14:17 Guys, I didn't say what new Pokemon I like.
01:14:19 Oh, please, monkey, please.
01:14:21 The one that gave me the best reaction was Crab Roller.
01:14:26 Yeah, I love that guy.
01:14:27 Hey, what do you mean, buddy?
01:14:28 You're fucking great.
01:14:30 Can we also say what our least favorite new Pokemon is too?
01:14:34 Yeah, yeah.
01:14:36 I haven't said my favorite yet,
01:14:37 but I don't really know.
01:14:40 I'm trying to decide if I should base this on design
01:14:43 or on like usage.
01:14:45 You can specify, you know.
01:14:47 I mean, there's a lot of good designs,
01:14:50 like Ribbon Bee is fucking adorable.
01:14:53 Ribbon Bee has been a staple of my team
01:14:55 and I love him so much.
01:14:56 I really like, God, what's he called?
01:15:02 Meteor.
01:15:03 Oh, the Meteor guy.
01:15:04 Yeah, he's awesome.
01:15:05 Meteor is really cool.
01:15:06 That asshole never saw one in the whole game.
01:15:09 I was trying to catch that guy.
01:15:10 He kept self-destructing.
01:15:11 It was a big problem, so I gave up.
01:15:13 Never saw him.
01:15:13 No trainers had him.
01:15:16 Turton Nader's pretty all right.
01:15:18 Oh, I hate that guy.
01:15:19 I like Trampa's dumbass face.
01:15:22 Oh, I really like Trampa.
01:15:24 The one that I expected to totally hate
01:15:29 and then absolutely loved.
01:15:30 And I think the second form has the terrible design,
01:15:33 but fucking Mudbray and Mudsdale are just so good
01:15:37 as like teammates.
01:15:38 Like, he was the only one who's like an absolute mainstay.
01:15:42 I mean, like the donkey?
01:15:43 Yeah, the donkey's adorable.
01:15:46 And then it evolves into this hideous fucking horse.
01:15:49 Very underwhelmed, very underwhelmed by their designs.
01:15:53 Yeah.
01:15:54 Not excited about them.
01:15:55 I'm okay with the first form,
01:15:56 but the second form is just hideous,
01:15:57 but like, he's so fucking good.
01:16:00 I really came to like him
01:16:01 because just because we met like a trainer,
01:16:04 you know, that girl, whatever her name was,
01:16:06 who would know her or something.
01:16:08 I was like, that guy was like her, her rock, you know?
01:16:11 He was cool.
01:16:12 And you get to like those guys.
01:16:14 I like, I respect for that Pokemon.
01:16:16 He's a hardworking dude.
01:16:17 I also, have any of you seen Pu-Ku-Mu?
01:16:20 Pu-Ku-Mu?
01:16:21 Which one's that?
01:16:22 I have.
01:16:23 I don't know the name.
01:16:25 Pu-Ku-Mu-Ku.
01:16:26 Oh my God, that thing is disgusting and I love it.
01:16:30 It's this little black ball with like red spikes on it
01:16:32 that's got like an anus for a face,
01:16:34 but like, it's basically like,
01:16:37 I think it's meant to be kind of the Wabafet of this game
01:16:41 where it does like weird fucked up things
01:16:43 and has weird attacks and like it's...
01:16:45 It gets cursed.
01:16:46 Dude, it literally spews out its organs to attack every turn.
01:16:50 It's revolting.
01:16:51 Oh, there's an actual animal like that in real life.
01:16:54 Yeah.
01:16:54 There's a little mini game you can play
01:16:57 when you get to this resort hotel where you can like,
01:16:59 you have to, they basically pay you
01:17:01 to chuck Pu-Ku-Mu's back into the sea.
01:17:04 Yeah.
01:17:05 You just walk around the beach picking up Pu-Ku-Mu's
01:17:07 and throwing them back into the ocean.
01:17:08 Sadly, there's no animation for it.
01:17:10 Excuse me, trainer.
01:17:11 There are Pu-Ku-Mu's horrifying our beach goers.
01:17:14 We would appreciate it if you could get them
01:17:15 the fuck out of here.
01:17:16 It said that people trip over them, so.
01:17:19 Oh, God.
01:17:20 Just imagine like tripping and like falling
01:17:21 on a sack of organs and it bursting in your face.
01:17:24 Oh, God!
01:17:25 Ah!
01:17:26 Hey, was it Barakamon that has the episode at the beach
01:17:30 where they like grab sea cucumbers
01:17:33 and they like squirt their gross white in it all over?
01:17:36 Yeah.
01:17:37 I believe that's the one.
01:17:38 What kind of a defense mechanism is that?
01:17:39 Who does that?
01:17:42 Oh, whatever.
01:17:43 Oh, yeah, it was Barakamon.
01:17:44 I mean, don't ask me.
01:17:45 Barakamon?
01:17:46 Yeah.
01:17:47 Yeah.
01:17:48 One of the only animes I've ever seen.
01:17:51 I don't think I have any particularly Pokemon I disliked.
01:17:56 I will say that I did like that Meteor Pokemon a lot.
01:17:59 I wish that had a chance to use them in my team,
01:18:01 but I just got so frustrated by his self-destruction.
01:18:04 But I like that guy a lot.
01:18:05 His design is cool.
01:18:06 He's a Meteor boy.
01:18:07 Awesome.
01:18:09 I was like Bruxish.
01:18:11 Wait, which one's Bruxish?
01:18:13 Bruxish is the idiot's fucking fish.
01:18:15 That ugly ass fucking di-dive monstrosity.
01:18:19 It's uglier than wishy-washy?
01:18:21 It is uglier than wishy-washy, by the way.
01:18:24 Hey, you know what?
01:18:25 I'm trying.
01:18:25 Did you see it's like...
01:18:26 I have absolutely no idea what any of you
01:18:28 have been saying about these Pokemon.
01:18:30 Because most of them are like,
01:18:32 most of them you won't even fucking see.
01:18:34 Like so many of the new Pokemon never even show up.
01:18:36 Guys, look at the shiny of Bruxish.
01:18:39 Hey, he looks cool.
01:18:41 No, he's fucking ugly.
01:18:42 Another pick for my favorite is a cutie fly in Rybon.
01:18:46 Those guys are really great.
01:18:47 Yeah, cutie fly is great.
01:18:48 You know what this Bruxish reminds me of the game
01:18:51 Amazing Island, where you make your own monsters
01:18:54 to do mini games with?
01:18:56 It looks like something a child would make.
01:18:58 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
01:18:59 It looks like something that my fucking brother,
01:19:02 when he was eight, would have made an Amazing Island.
01:19:05 By the way, guys, here's a substantive point
01:19:08 about something that I love about this game.
01:19:10 And it is by making the transition of Pokemon to 3D
01:19:13 and adding something like the Pokemon interaction thing,
01:19:17 refresh or whatever, and the petting stuff,
01:19:19 what that's done is it's forced Game Freak
01:19:22 to add more personality to their Pokemon
01:19:24 than would have been visible before.
01:19:26 Like what I said before about how the Drake,
01:19:30 Drake, the Grass Starter Final Evolution,
01:19:33 how it pulls its little things.
01:19:35 City-wise.
01:19:36 Yeah, yeah, just city-wise, that's right.
01:19:38 How it pulls the leaves to shrink its hoodie self.
01:19:41 Like having something like the Pokemon refresh thing
01:19:45 that lets you interact with them personally
01:19:47 and having a 3D model that can do these extra animations
01:19:49 way easier than a sprite would be animated to do,
01:19:52 it lets you learn things about the Pokemon
01:19:55 and the way they act and more details about them.
01:19:58 And I think that is great.
01:19:59 I do like that.
01:19:59 In White 2, I was really,
01:20:02 I really liked when I encountered a Jolteon
01:20:05 and it's animation, it has like a really fast animation.
01:20:08 Like it's just sitting there,
01:20:09 but it's like jittering back and forth really fast.
01:20:12 Yeah, it's personality.
01:20:13 In the old games that they never could have done that,
01:20:15 but the fact that like it had better graphics
01:20:18 and this one, it gives it this weird movement
01:20:20 that like really gives it more.
01:20:22 Yeah, I do really like that stuff.
01:20:24 One thing I've noticed about the models in particular,
01:20:29 the first gen one is that they're exactly the same
01:20:33 as the ones you can see in Pokemon Go,
01:20:35 which is pretty cool.
01:20:37 Are they the exact same models?
01:20:39 Yeah, I've checked a lot of them, they're all the same.
01:20:41 Oh, that's, I have no problem with that.
01:20:42 They definitely have a standard 3D model
01:20:45 that they're using henceforth.
01:20:46 Cool.
01:20:47 Cool.
01:20:48 Part of the reason I really like Pokemon Go
01:20:50 is just being able to look at a Pokemon in 3D
01:20:52 and tap them and make them do a funny thing.
01:20:54 And it's like you can do that in this game
01:20:56 and it's just good.
01:20:58 I like that.
01:20:59 I'm good.
01:21:01 Oh.
01:21:06 So anyone have any other topics regarding the sun and moon?
01:21:10 They want to talk.
01:21:11 I have one.
01:21:12 I have some way of do ranting I could do.
01:21:13 Monkey, you go ahead.
01:21:14 Okay, okay, listen boys.
01:21:17 I don't want to stay on this too long.
01:21:19 It boys ain't girl.
01:21:20 But here's the thing.
01:21:22 Mage, I just met you, nothing against you.
01:21:24 But otherwise, the only person here who I like is Hippocrite.
01:21:27 I don't give the fuck about the rest of it.
01:21:29 Right, sure.
01:21:30 So Hippocrite, I need to know.
01:21:32 This is your Spider-Man in the Civil War moment.
01:21:34 Are you team Ben Saint or team Monkey?
01:21:37 I need a definitive answer.
01:21:39 Right fucking now.
01:21:40 Yeah, me too.
01:21:41 You know what?
01:21:42 Uh-oh.
01:21:44 I don't know.
01:21:45 I'm rooting for both of you
01:21:47 because I haven't seen your first battle.
01:21:48 I don't know.
01:21:50 I don't know.
01:21:51 The world hasn't seen it.
01:21:52 Hippo, Hippo, by trying to please both of us,
01:21:56 you've pleased neither of us.
01:21:57 That's true.
01:21:58 You're now under your worst.
01:22:00 Hippo, you're shunned from being untimely.
01:22:03 I'm throwing you under the bus.
01:22:04 Let me make an educated decision.
01:22:06 No, no, I won't allow that.
01:22:09 Let's see who wins the first battle so we can play it.
01:22:11 Oh, okay, this is the stronger party.
01:22:12 You've got to go with the stronger side.
01:22:14 You've got to choose now for your decision to mean everything.
01:22:16 Based on your videos,
01:22:19 I think
01:22:23 it's going to be Momke.
01:22:23 Yeah!
01:22:24 Oh, no!
01:22:25 Fuck you, Ben.
01:22:26 Oh, my God.
01:22:27 I just enjoy the chipper attitude.
01:22:32 Yeah.
01:22:33 Oh, wow, Ben.
01:22:33 I can be chipper.
01:22:34 Wait.
01:22:35 I feel the opposite.
01:22:37 I felt like Ben was way more chipper,
01:22:40 whereas Momke, at least in the first three,
01:22:44 was like, oh, this game is not friendly to Nuzlocs.
01:22:47 I can't get enough Pokemon.
01:22:49 Yeah, you know what?
01:22:50 I don't know.
01:22:50 I actually can't remember anything
01:22:52 that I've seen in my review videos.
01:22:54 I guess you have to have a chipper off
01:22:57 so that the most chipper will gain my affection.
01:23:00 We'll put you both into a wood chipper
01:23:02 and whoever crawls out is the winner.
01:23:03 Yeah, let's go fargo up in here.
01:23:07 No, I'm on Team Momke.
01:23:13 Well, Ben, we know that your goal is to enslave,
01:23:16 you know, dominate all the Pokemon.
01:23:17 Momke, do you have any goal of this nature?
01:23:19 Are you just trying to be the best boy you can be?
01:23:21 Yeah, my goal was to dominate all the Pokemon, too.
01:23:24 OK, so it's a real clash of the superpowers here.
01:23:27 But Momke's doing it sexually.
01:23:29 Yeah, baby.
01:23:34 I'm tempted to.
01:23:36 I had like a little weeaboo revelation
01:23:39 in the course of this conversation,
01:23:40 but I don't think anybody will know.
01:23:42 Nobody will know what I'm talking about.
01:23:44 So I will only do it if you guys give a proof.
01:23:45 Throw it out there. I want to hear it.
01:23:47 I just want. OK, I go for it.
01:23:50 All right, well, there's this.
01:23:51 Actually, Ben, you'll know what I'm talking about
01:23:53 because you've seen this show.
01:23:55 The anime series Katana Gattari.
01:23:58 Katana Gattari is a show about like there's 12 different
01:24:01 like guys who all are like they have a special sword
01:24:04 and they're all like crazy weird designs.
01:24:06 And each one is like you there's like some kind of weird way
01:24:09 that the main character has to fight them in order to,
01:24:12 you know, to get their sword.
01:24:13 And they're all these like really different,
01:24:15 interesting types of fights.
01:24:17 And the guy who did the character designs
01:24:20 for Katana Gattari like I think did like the designs
01:24:24 for this game because I was saying, man,
01:24:26 the characters in this really look like Katana Gattari.
01:24:27 They're all like weird hairstyles
01:24:29 and really out there stuff.
01:24:30 And then someone told me, yeah, that the character designer,
01:24:32 his name shows up twice in the credits.
01:24:34 And I was like, oh, shit, he actually worked on it.
01:24:36 Then I thought about it.
01:24:38 And the way that the trials are in this game
01:24:39 where each one is like a really unique,
01:24:41 different kind of way to get your stone
01:24:43 is kind of like Katana Gattari.
01:24:45 And then the entire Aether Foundation plot
01:24:48 is just literally the story of Kill, Lock, Kill,
01:24:51 like exactly the same story.
01:24:53 So this game is basically Katana Gattari
01:24:55 and Kill, Lock, Kill combined.
01:24:58 You know, okay.
01:24:59 Sure, that's reasonable.
01:25:02 But you know what?
01:25:03 Katana Gattari was very disappointing.
01:25:05 It was.
01:25:06 I disagree.
01:25:08 Though it was like more talky than I would have liked to be.
01:25:11 Well, of course it's talky.
01:25:13 Dude, the ending was the fucking best thing that ever happened.
01:25:15 The last episode was pure orgasm.
01:25:17 That last episode made me want to kill myself.
01:25:19 I hated it more than anything in the world.
01:25:21 Just tell me why.
01:25:22 Real quick, why?
01:25:23 Dude, I have a 4,000 word post on my blog about that,
01:25:27 if you want to read.
01:25:28 Sum it up in five words, did you?
01:25:29 Just tell me why.
01:25:31 Gay, gay, gay, nigger dick.
01:25:33 The final fight up the tower was fine.
01:25:37 It was the girls.
01:25:39 That was terrible too.
01:25:40 I don't know, whatever.
01:25:41 It was the girls.
01:25:42 Guys, guys, guys, let's keep on topic.
01:25:44 No, I don't want to say that it was the girls.
01:25:47 Get away from the anime.
01:25:49 Shut up.
01:25:50 It was the girl being like, yes, I was only,
01:25:53 I only, I tricked myself into loving you
01:25:57 as a part of my scheme to use you.
01:26:00 I didn't care about that at all.
01:26:01 I didn't care about that.
01:26:02 But okay, I did have something Pokemon related about that.
01:26:06 Wait, I just want to make a note
01:26:08 that the Ben St. Army and the Ben St. Fascist regime
01:26:11 coming to a store near you takes a hard line stance
01:26:15 against human Pokemon sexual relations.
01:26:20 I take the exact opposite stance.
01:26:22 I knew, I thought so.
01:26:24 You know, Ben, I was about to say that I am
01:26:28 I'm very against that and I won't allow it.
01:26:30 I'm going to have my own, I need a Magi-Chan to monitor
01:26:34 How do you all feel about the whole of being
01:26:36 a Pokedex occurring?
01:26:38 How do you feel about there now being
01:26:39 a dominatrix Pokemon?
01:26:41 Is there?
01:26:42 Who's that?
01:26:43 There's a Pokemon called Serena.
01:26:45 It's the final.
01:26:45 Oh yeah.
01:26:47 Of whatever.
01:26:48 It literally is just like a dominatrix.
01:26:50 I was hoping you were going to say it was
01:26:52 the Alolan form of Mr. Mime.
01:26:58 Ben, I was going to say, Ben,
01:27:00 that I'm going to put my flag down
01:27:02 and say that I am firmly on Team Ben St.
01:27:04 But this sexual relations clause has blown out.
01:27:07 Oh no, I'm driving away my core constituency.
01:27:11 The fact that no one still exists, Ben,
01:27:13 means that I can never adopt this philosophy.
01:27:15 So you're done.
01:27:16 You're done for all time.
01:27:17 Are you on Team Humpty then, Nate?
01:27:18 I have no choice.
01:27:19 It's the only option.
01:27:20 I'm firmly on Team Humpty.
01:27:21 You're all sinners.
01:27:22 I got you're own fucking brother, dude.
01:27:24 Sinners!
01:27:26 You did this to yourself, Ben.
01:27:27 You made your bed.
01:27:28 Okay, by the way, substantive point,
01:27:30 by the way, I was going to say,
01:27:31 I hated every single trial.
01:27:34 I think gyms being sacrificed for trials
01:27:37 was a huge mistake.
01:27:38 Why did you hate the trials?
01:27:39 The trials?
01:27:40 See, well, okay, let me respond to that.
01:27:43 Okay, the trials already,
01:27:45 or the gyms before, they were the battles,
01:27:48 but they also had like a puzzle,
01:27:50 some of which were really dumb.
01:27:51 So it seems like the trials are kind of just like the puzzle
01:27:54 that used to just be incorporated into the gym.
01:27:57 Yeah, only with random battles, so.
01:27:59 The trials I've seen so far.
01:28:01 I did the thing where you have to find the Zangus,
01:28:04 or not the Zangus, the young Goose.
01:28:06 It was pretty minimal.
01:28:08 It didn't bother me that much.
01:28:09 It was kind of dumb, but whatever.
01:28:10 I know that there's one, or the one in the demo,
01:28:13 and I feel like there's probably one coming up
01:28:14 that involves the Pokefinder,
01:28:16 and I hate the Pokefinder.
01:28:17 Nope, never have to use it.
01:28:19 Oh, thank God.
01:28:20 The young Goose one is like the most.
01:28:21 In the demo you had to use.
01:28:23 I think the young Goose one took the longest
01:28:24 out of like any of the trials.
01:28:26 Well, that are like the grass one.
01:28:28 They're all like the grass one.
01:28:29 You can think that the trials,
01:28:31 you just have to chase it down the normal ones.
01:28:33 You have to go to the holes and find them in their holes,
01:28:35 and then you gotta get those.
01:28:36 For me, that's a Redditor one.
01:28:38 Oh, really?
01:28:39 Yeah, yeah, it's different between Sun and Moon.
01:28:41 Ah, interesting.
01:28:42 Well, okay, you can find them inoffensive.
01:28:45 I didn't really hate them.
01:28:46 Yeah, I agree with Ben.
01:28:47 They kind of felt like the puzzles from gyms
01:28:49 that I also didn't give a shit about,
01:28:50 and could do without, frankly.
01:28:51 But that still leaves you with what I consider a big loss,
01:28:55 and that is,
01:28:56 the lead up of fighting all the elementally,
01:28:59 or the type-themed trainers in one condensed space,
01:29:03 and then lead up to a big gym fight,
01:29:05 because one of the most valuable things about that,
01:29:07 in my opinion, is that it does what Digi said,
01:29:10 or what Digi was talking about before,
01:29:11 and it encourages you to switch up
01:29:14 the Pokemon they're using,
01:29:15 because you know that you'll want a certain Pokemon
01:29:18 with a certain type to be used for that gym currently,
01:29:21 with the way you work with trials.
01:29:22 I don't think that, I don't think that's the case.
01:29:25 I don't think that, I didn't feel that pressure at all.
01:29:28 The different trials have different types of Pokemon anyway,
01:29:31 so you change the moves anyway.
01:29:32 Dude, just tell me,
01:29:33 did you really feel a sense of satisfaction
01:29:35 clearing a trial versus beating a gym?
01:29:37 Because I felt it was way less.
01:29:38 Yeah, I felt it was exactly the same.
01:29:40 I don't care about gyms.
01:29:41 I had more fun, honestly.
01:29:42 This isn't about fun, Mage.
01:29:44 It's about extracting as much percentage of gratification
01:29:46 as you can.
01:29:47 I mean, it's satisfying to beat a book.
01:29:48 It's fun.
01:29:50 Yeah, I thought the trials were,
01:29:52 I thought all of them were cool.
01:29:53 I like how they were so unique from one another.
01:29:56 And the trial Pokemon are harder than gym leaders,
01:29:58 because with gym leaders,
01:30:00 you only have to fight one Pokemon at a time,
01:30:02 and in this, you have to fight two.
01:30:04 Well, like I said, I don't dislike the totem battles.
01:30:06 I think the totem battles are fine,
01:30:07 but you have to admit, there is something lost here.
01:30:10 Like, the way that gyms work is the only thing
01:30:13 I thought was, sorry, Hippo.
01:30:16 Well, for me, the thing that is lost is the trainers,
01:30:19 but I don't care really about the trainers.
01:30:22 I guess I missed that a little bit, but it's not.
01:30:26 I think there was a simultaneous gain and loss
01:30:29 in the trial areas versus the gyms,
01:30:31 because on the one hand, I thought the gyms,
01:30:34 there's a lot more memorable ones.
01:30:36 In X and Y, there's one where you fucking swing
01:30:39 across these vines and you're climbing this tower
01:30:41 to go fight a grass guy.
01:30:43 There's one where you're navigating a spider's web
01:30:46 to go fight the bug guy.
01:30:47 There's nothing in this game that's like that.
01:30:49 There's something that's so different and out there
01:30:51 that it really sticks out.
01:30:52 But on the other hand,
01:30:55 going to fight the first kahuna is just like,
01:30:57 I just went into his hut and fought him.
01:31:00 But on the other hand, with the trial areas,
01:31:04 they are places you can go back to
01:31:06 and they're actually integrated into the world
01:31:08 and they feel more like a part of the world
01:31:11 whereas the gyms are just these totally isolated things
01:31:14 that have nothing to do with the rest of the game.
01:31:16 Well, yeah, but they're sitting that way.
01:31:17 It's not like that's out of place, they're done.
01:31:19 But both the gyms and the elite four
01:31:22 are kind of like that in the other games
01:31:23 where it's just like you just kind of show up at a place
01:31:26 where it's like, okay, now it's time
01:31:28 to just have this radically different experience.
01:31:30 Whereas in this game, all of the captains
01:31:32 are like introduced way beforehand.
01:31:34 You already know who they are.
01:31:35 Well, I'll just say that experience was, in my opinion,
01:31:38 the best part of Pokemon games.
01:31:40 So obviously for me, I'm not going to like that.
01:31:42 In Gen five, at least,
01:31:45 like I know in white two, like the champion
01:31:48 and like previous champions and the elite four
01:31:50 and the gym leaders, they will,
01:31:52 I think it's mostly in the post-game,
01:31:54 but like they show up and like you encounter them,
01:31:57 like if you go to fight in the Pokemon World Tournament,
01:31:59 the gym leaders and the elite four
01:32:01 will be your opponent sometime.
01:32:03 And there's like a place, I think they like,
01:32:06 I think some of them like rents-
01:32:07 I think that's why I did that with the battle shateau.
01:32:08 Like they rent summer homes in Undellatown, I think,
01:32:12 or at least one of them like has a summer home
01:32:13 in Undellatown and like they kind of do things
01:32:16 around the world.
01:32:18 This isn't the first game to have the gym leaders
01:32:21 sort of be more integrated into like the workings
01:32:23 of the world, but it is definitely feels,
01:32:26 I feel like they pushed it a lot more,
01:32:27 kind of like I feel the way that they pushed like Pokemon
01:32:30 as a part of daily life.
01:32:32 Yeah, sure.
01:32:33 Ride Pokemon.
01:32:34 Let me just tell you, like, I mean,
01:32:35 when you first meet Elima,
01:32:36 I wouldn't have even known he was a gym leader.
01:32:39 It was just like a guy you kind of knew.
01:32:40 I wouldn't have even known it was a he.
01:32:42 Yeah.
01:32:43 Yeah.
01:32:44 I could tell it still, yeah.
01:32:45 I could, yeah, same.
01:32:47 I was lying.
01:32:50 Well, I mean, I was just gonna say,
01:32:51 my favorite part of any Pokemon game ever
01:32:55 is in Heart, Gold, and Soul, Silver
01:32:57 at the end of the game in the post game
01:32:59 where you can track down each gym leader
01:33:03 that you fought, of which there are 16.
01:33:04 You can break into the house and kill them.
01:33:06 That's right.
01:33:07 You can follow, it's incredibly complex to get them all,
01:33:10 but there is one house where you can gather
01:33:12 every single Pokemon trainer, every single gym leader,
01:33:15 and then you can fight them, not as they were before,
01:33:17 because if the first gym leader you fight
01:33:19 is the flying guy who has two pieces of shit flying types,
01:33:22 they do nothing, they're level five or whatever,
01:33:24 but here, he's got a team of six guys,
01:33:26 they're all maxed out.
01:33:28 The best team you could possibly have
01:33:30 for a flying type gym leader,
01:33:32 fighting each of those guys and beating them
01:33:34 is the best experience of any Pokemon ever
01:33:37 because it's fun.
01:33:38 Nothing is cooler than theming a Pokemon team
01:33:40 around one elements and then strategizing how to fight it
01:33:43 and like, oh, what am I gonna do?
01:33:44 He's gonna counter me with this.
01:33:45 It's the best, it's the best.
01:33:46 And I definitely feel like with the de-emphasis of gyms
01:33:50 in general and the fact you don't even fight
01:33:51 some gym leaders, that's de-emphasized.
01:33:54 So my only point is that, yeah, this thing,
01:33:56 I really like it and it wasn't as big a part of this game.
01:33:59 So, all right, we can move on from that anyway.
01:34:02 Hey guys, I think I have a question
01:34:05 we should have probably asked at the very beginning.
01:34:07 Which version of the game you have
01:34:09 and which starter did you start with?
01:34:10 Just curious.
01:34:11 Oh, well, I, Ben Sainz, got sun
01:34:14 and I got a Goose the Rowlet.
01:34:17 So, real quick, before we move on from that topic though,
01:34:21 I'm looking into it and you can indeed fight
01:34:24 most of the trial captains again.
01:34:27 Like, if you go back to where they were,
01:34:30 you can fight them for real.
01:34:33 Well, that's great.
01:34:34 That's exactly what I was hoping would happen.
01:34:36 So that's good on it, good on the sun and moon.
01:34:38 Though I would really wonder why it isn't all.
01:34:40 I know in white too, you could,
01:34:42 there was like secondary fights for all the gym leaders
01:34:45 and stuff after you became champion.
01:34:50 Fantastic, couldn't be happier.
01:34:51 That's exactly the sort of thing I want Pokemon to do
01:34:53 every single time, never deviate from that.
01:34:56 Because the thing, Pokemon rewards you,
01:34:59 the thing that feels the best about playing Pokemon,
01:35:01 at least to me, is big climactic battles
01:35:05 where you're pushed to stress and strategize
01:35:08 and it's even more fun when they're themed
01:35:10 around a certain type and then winning.
01:35:12 You feel great, you get like a badge
01:35:14 that's designated for that thing.
01:35:16 It's the best.
01:35:16 It's the best thing Pokemon has to offer.
01:35:18 Let's go back to the mage question.
01:35:20 Yeah, please.
01:35:22 Well, I got Pokemon moon and I got the Snoopy Clown boy.
01:35:27 Snoopy Clown.
01:35:28 Are you talking about?
01:35:30 Ah, Paulio.
01:35:31 Oh, right.
01:35:32 He's not.
01:35:32 He's not Clio.
01:35:33 He's not Clio.
01:35:34 Hey, he's not Clio.
01:35:37 I'm same as Gibbon.
01:35:39 I also got moon and I got Poplio.
01:35:41 I'm exactly the same as you guys.
01:35:43 Oh, that's crazy.
01:35:44 I got sun and I picked Rowlet
01:35:46 because he's objectively the best.
01:35:48 Yeah, we're sun, Rowlet boys.
01:35:50 Yeah, we are, all right.
01:35:52 And we're moon.
01:35:53 All three of us.
01:35:54 Nobody likes cats.
01:35:55 No one picked Litten, yeah.
01:35:56 Yeah.
01:35:57 You know, Litten's first form is indeed dope.
01:35:59 I like Litten.
01:36:00 I was on team Litten until I saw his third evolution
01:36:04 and then I just abandoned him immediately.
01:36:07 Some people like it.
01:36:09 I like it because he's a wrestler,
01:36:10 but he doesn't, it's stupid.
01:36:12 He's still ugly.
01:36:13 Tony the Tiger sort of bullshit.
01:36:15 Yeah, like I've said this so many times
01:36:18 to so many people, I like the theme.
01:36:19 I think it's cool that he's a wrestler,
01:36:21 but I just hate that how he looks.
01:36:27 I gotta say, I kind of regretted getting sun.
01:36:29 Not that, I mean, I would have got it anyways
01:36:31 because I always picked like the red one.
01:36:33 It's like a nostalgia thing.
01:36:35 But I found out only after having played
01:36:38 through the whole game that they're on different clocks
01:36:41 that in moon, it's like everything's time
01:36:43 of adjusted 12 hours from where you currently are.
01:36:46 So like it's always night at day and day at night.
01:36:49 And I was like, this would have been a huge help for me
01:36:51 because I only played in the fucking, you know,
01:36:53 in the AMs, like just staying up all night.
01:36:57 And so I actually had to change my in-game clock in sun
01:37:01 so that I could catch daytime Pokemon.
01:37:03 Well, wouldn't you have had to do it
01:37:04 the opposite way to catch nighttime Pokemon?
01:37:06 I don't know that there are a lot of nighttime Pokemon,
01:37:08 maybe.
01:37:09 Yeah, wherever.
01:37:11 Radita, it's very important.
01:37:12 There would have been more nighttime Pokemon in Pokemon.
01:37:16 The most important Pokemon.
01:37:18 Alola Ratata.
01:37:20 Alola Ratata.
01:37:22 What a wonderful mon.
01:37:25 Alola Ratata.
01:37:29 Someone fill in for me.
01:37:30 Eight, no.
01:37:31 My Android dog.
01:37:34 Queens, no worries for the rest of your days.
01:37:39 Kahoola Matata.
01:37:41 All right, Kahoola Matata.
01:37:44 So are we going to go ahead and say
01:37:46 that this is just a Pokemon Sun and Moon podcast?
01:37:48 Yeah, I think we've abandoned.
01:37:50 Well, I mean, if we do a general Pokemon podcast,
01:37:54 it would be also hours long.
01:37:55 That would take 50 hours.
01:37:56 So we can do that either as a separate thing.
01:37:59 It was funny because I didn't think,
01:38:00 I thought we wouldn't end up talking about Sun and Moon
01:38:03 that much because almost no one's played much.
01:38:06 I mean, we beat it, but.
01:38:09 I mean, all right, what is there to talk about?
01:38:11 Sun and Moon has rendered all the other Pokemon games obsolete.
01:38:14 They don't matter anymore.
01:38:15 No, no.
01:38:16 It's as though they never were.
01:38:17 We have to go back.
01:38:19 We have to remember.
01:38:22 We've got to make Pokemon great again.
01:38:24 Yeah, we just have to keep the good, improve the bad.
01:38:29 Who said that Kukui was the sexiest professor?
01:38:32 The sexiest professor is Professor Willow from Pokemon Go.
01:38:36 Hey, Pokemon Go, that doesn't fucking count.
01:38:39 No, I'm just kidding.
01:38:40 Can you talk about how much I hate Pokemon Go
01:38:42 before we end this thing?
01:38:43 Yeah, please, yeah, tell me about how much you hate Pokemon Go.
01:38:45 Pokemon Go is the greatest.
01:38:46 Pokemon Go fucking sucks because I live in Iowa.
01:38:49 Oh, yeah.
01:38:51 It's fucking, the farmhouse doesn't count as a stop.
01:38:55 I have tried so hard to enjoy Pokemon Go
01:38:58 and at many times I have succeeded,
01:39:00 but they just keep making it worse with every update.
01:39:04 They keep making their own game worse on purpose
01:39:07 over and over again.
01:39:08 Ben was having such a great time.
01:39:10 He was telling us all these stories
01:39:11 and it's only, it's only good.
01:39:12 For the first week, for the first,
01:39:15 well, I mean, when I play it,
01:39:17 now how I play it is when I go somewhere,
01:39:20 I get in the car, I boot it up,
01:39:21 and then when I get out of the car,
01:39:22 I look around and see if there's anything to catch.
01:39:24 If there is, I catch it,
01:39:25 and that's how I play Pokemon Go.
01:39:27 In the first week that it was out,
01:39:31 there was the beautiful thing,
01:39:32 there was a tracking system
01:39:33 that would let you actually track down a Pokemon.
01:39:36 Like you could see where it was
01:39:38 and it would give you a good idea
01:39:39 of like where to go to find it.
01:39:41 And I was like walking around neighborhoods.
01:39:43 I was walking into like parking lots and stuff.
01:39:46 I was going like-
01:39:46 Children's playgrounds.
01:39:48 Yeah, I was going like-
01:39:50 Hearing in their windows at night.
01:39:51 I was sneaking onto private property
01:39:55 and trying to fucking find these Pokemon.
01:39:57 It was the most fun I ever had.
01:39:58 It was fucking amazing.
01:39:59 Me and my friends went to Tufts University
01:40:01 and we ran, we would spread out.
01:40:04 We'd be like, oh shit, a hitmoanly.
01:40:06 And we would spread out and when someone saw the radar
01:40:09 like go down from three steps to two,
01:40:11 they'd be like, it's this way.
01:40:12 And we'd all run that direction.
01:40:14 Like we would all go converge on them.
01:40:17 It was like the greatest thing.
01:40:18 And then a week after it came out,
01:40:20 they took that feature out and they never put it back
01:40:23 because they just don't want it.
01:40:27 Because they're like, oh no,
01:40:28 that's not how you're supposed to play our game.
01:40:30 You're not supposed to be able to find the Pokemon.
01:40:33 You're only supposed to catch the ones
01:40:35 that you randomly happened to stumble across.
01:40:37 Wasn't the excuse that it was too much
01:40:38 of like a maintenance server issue thing?
01:40:41 They never said that.
01:40:42 That is what fucking assholes on the Reddit said.
01:40:46 They were trying to think of excuses for the company.
01:40:49 No, there's no way-
01:40:50 I think maybe it's because they didn't want people
01:40:51 sneaking onto private property all the time.
01:40:53 Yeah, well, fuck them.
01:40:54 Or flooding those heads.
01:40:56 That's not the game I want.
01:40:57 The game I want is not one that discourages me
01:41:00 from doing such things.
01:41:02 It was the most important one ever.
01:41:03 The only good thing to come from Pokemon Go
01:41:05 was the great Hippocrite video you can find in the description.
01:41:08 Go click on the link right now.
01:41:09 Give it a big ol' like, subscribe.
01:41:10 And playing the season.
01:41:12 I'm going to remember to put that in the description.
01:41:15 Maybe someone will say in the comments.
01:41:17 I'll put it in the comments.
01:41:18 Hippo, that was a really good video.
01:41:19 And I didn't even know the reference and I still liked it.
01:41:23 I'm curious, Gib.
01:41:25 How have you managed to enjoy Pokemon Go
01:41:27 despite all these deficits?
01:41:30 Well, the first thing was I wasn't around
01:41:33 at the very beginning when everyone was-
01:41:35 When it was good.
01:41:35 So you don't know what you've lost, yeah.
01:41:38 Well, I mean, there was the tracker,
01:41:39 but I didn't have a group of friends to play with.
01:41:42 And I never felt like going to track Pokemon.
01:41:46 I was just so like, well, there's a Pidgey.
01:41:48 I haven't got a Pidgey yet.
01:41:49 I'll go get that.
01:41:50 Tracking things, I didn't really,
01:41:52 I mean, I live in a suburban area and there's not a,
01:41:55 there weren't a lot of spawns around.
01:41:57 Recently, they've upped spawns in general
01:41:59 in lower spawn areas.
01:42:01 So it's more tolerable now,
01:42:03 but I didn't use the track to its fullest extent.
01:42:06 So I don't know, I don't really know what I've lost.
01:42:09 We had a good time playing Pokemon Go all day.
01:42:13 Oh yeah, we went to London.
01:42:14 We got a bunch of Gengar, it was great.
01:42:16 Where was mine?
01:42:17 We also got the Charmander nest, remember?
01:42:19 Oh yeah.
01:42:20 Yeah, I went there with my brother.
01:42:22 Right next to Buckingham Palace is a fucking Charmander.
01:42:24 It's probably changed now,
01:42:25 but there's fucking Charmander everywhere.
01:42:27 But the reason that I am still having fun with it
01:42:29 is because I don't have that too many things to catch,
01:42:34 but I do have a lot of walking to do.
01:42:35 I have a lot of eggs to hatch
01:42:36 and I have a lot of candy to get.
01:42:39 Hippo, part of your involvement with that game,
01:42:41 wasn't it because you don't generally like the Pokemon games?
01:42:44 And this was like one that's not a Pokemon game?
01:42:48 I liked it because I generally,
01:42:50 I mean, I'd been playing the Nuzlocke
01:42:53 because Ben played the Nuzlocke
01:42:55 because Monkey played the Nuzlocke.
01:42:56 I wanted to give it a go.
01:42:58 And I decided, I realized I don't actually like
01:43:01 the battling in Pokemon.
01:43:02 Oh yeah, I forgot your deep hatred
01:43:04 of all the Pokemon.
01:43:05 Why haven't we touched on that?
01:43:06 Let's get that debate going.
01:43:09 The battling in this Pokemon moon's been great, so.
01:43:12 Talk about a hypocrite.
01:43:14 Wait, were you just complaining about moon
01:43:17 and how it was the worst game ever, like an hour ago?
01:43:20 No, that was because I was trying to catch a Phoebus,
01:43:22 but I caught it.
01:43:24 Oh, hey, I just remembered about how in battles,
01:43:27 they show you what your moves are gonna do
01:43:29 and that's bullshit.
01:43:30 That's casualization.
01:43:31 No, it's awesome.
01:43:32 No, it's the best thing that's ever happened.
01:43:34 It's great.
01:43:36 The fact that you like it is what makes it casualization.
01:43:38 Yeah, that's right.
01:43:39 I don't know how to put them straight.
01:43:41 It doesn't feel like attaching items to his Pokemon.
01:43:44 It's definitely casualization,
01:43:45 but I don't think that's a bad thing.
01:43:47 Okay, but think about it.
01:43:48 I don't like it, but I can live with it.
01:43:51 Dude, just think about it.
01:43:52 So many times this has happened to me.
01:43:54 I've been playing through this game and like,
01:43:55 okay, all these Pokemon, yeah,
01:43:57 like I don't even think about what they are.
01:43:59 Just look at my moves.
01:43:59 It's gonna be strong.
01:44:00 I use this one.
01:44:01 What that's done is that when I then find a Pokemon
01:44:03 that I haven't seen before,
01:44:05 even if I know what type it is in my head,
01:44:07 I have not trained myself to remember
01:44:10 what is good against it
01:44:10 and then I just suffer because I, you know,
01:44:13 I'm not ready to prepare for the demo.
01:44:15 It's not, well, yeah, but it's the game
01:44:17 not leading me to learn.
01:44:18 I can't remember that perfectly fine.
01:44:20 You can't remember shit.
01:44:21 What's strong against dark?
01:44:23 Tell us what's good against dark.
01:44:25 It was a bug.
01:44:26 Fighting.
01:44:27 Because it was like that classic Game Grumps movement.
01:44:31 The goth kids don't like having bugs on them.
01:44:34 That's why.
01:44:35 That's one, but there's not something else
01:44:37 that's good against them.
01:44:37 I learned typing finally because of this mechanic,
01:44:40 but there were so many fights I got into
01:44:42 where like an enemy would show up and I'd be like,
01:44:44 what the fuck is that?
01:44:45 Because if you fight it for the first time,
01:44:47 it doesn't give you the information.
01:44:48 And usually that was the cause
01:44:50 of why I would have a team fight.
01:44:52 Wait, when you fight them the first time,
01:44:54 it doesn't tell you what's super effective.
01:44:56 No, it only tells you that if Pokemon
01:44:57 that are already in your Pokemon decks.
01:44:59 Well, I like that.
01:45:00 Then you have C.
01:45:01 You don't have to catch.
01:45:01 And if you're in a Nuzlocke,
01:45:03 then that means you can get totally fucked.
01:45:05 If there's some Pokemon you don't know what it is.
01:45:06 It's called just knowing what they are, dude.
01:45:08 You just got to know these things.
01:45:10 Some Pokemon designs just don't make sense.
01:45:13 Like, look at Crab Brawler, the Crab Brawler.
01:45:17 Yeah, I just, I mean, I would expect it to be
01:45:20 at least a little bit of water,
01:45:21 but no, it's just pure fighting.
01:45:23 Yeah, it's just totally fucked me up.
01:45:25 That's totally thought it would be water.
01:45:27 Totally meant to mess with you.
01:45:28 And it knows water attacks too.
01:45:30 So it totally fucked me.
01:45:31 Oh, like Laurentus, it's pink.
01:45:34 And it's like, it's based on a bug
01:45:36 that pretends to be a flower,
01:45:39 but it's pure grass type.
01:45:40 It's not even bug grass.
01:45:41 It's not bug fairy.
01:45:42 It's just pure grass.
01:45:44 It makes no sense.
01:45:45 These are problems to me.
01:45:46 There's lots of Pokemon that are weird like that.
01:45:49 Yeah.
01:45:50 When we talking about Pokemon Go,
01:45:52 I was trying to say something about,
01:45:55 all right, I don't like battling.
01:45:56 Pokemon Go was fun because I could just catch the Pokemon
01:45:59 and not have to battle.
01:46:00 That was that point.
01:46:01 Let me try and defend.
01:46:02 The main point I was getting to the whole time ago
01:46:06 was I like Pokemon Go because it gets me out of the house
01:46:10 and I like walking around the park every day.
01:46:12 That's it.
01:46:13 I think that's the main draw of Pokemon Go.
01:46:15 See the irony of how Ben plays Pokemon Go
01:46:18 is that Ben never leaves the house.
01:46:20 He only opens up Pokemon Go when we're already going somewhere
01:46:25 and then becomes entirely consumed by Pokemon Go.
01:46:29 As though it was a game that he's been playing obsessively
01:46:31 for the whole time,
01:46:34 but then actually he doesn't even think about it
01:46:36 until you leave the house
01:46:37 and then suddenly it's like the only thing
01:46:39 that matters in the world.
01:46:40 It's not with Game Freak every single day.
01:46:42 Ben got out of it.
01:46:43 We were stopped at a stoplight
01:46:45 and the light had just turned green
01:46:46 and Ben was like, wait, I see a Gengar.
01:46:48 He got out of the car.
01:46:50 Dude, that's a Gengar.
01:46:51 You got to get out of the car.
01:46:52 Yeah, man.
01:46:52 You fucking jump out into traffic for a Gengar.
01:46:56 That's why he's a Gengar.
01:46:57 He lures people to their death.
01:46:58 That's canon.
01:46:59 Yeah, yeah, speaking of Gengar,
01:47:00 I was reading the Sun and Moon Pokedex descriptions of him
01:47:04 and they're fucking horrible.
01:47:07 The Sun Pokedex says if you feel a sudden chill,
01:47:11 it means a Gengar is coming for you.
01:47:14 Don't give up.
01:47:16 You can't run.
01:47:18 You know what?
01:47:19 You don't have a sudden chill.
01:47:20 What if it's just a light breeze?
01:47:21 No, it's just like if you feel a sudden chill,
01:47:23 it means a Gengar is coming for you.
01:47:25 You can't escape.
01:47:26 There's no such thing as a light breeze.
01:47:28 Is this true, guys,
01:47:30 that what the Pokedex entries are
01:47:32 are kind of just the opinions of Rotom?
01:47:35 He's just like telling you what he thinks
01:47:36 is going on about these Pokemon.
01:47:37 He's like making shit up.
01:47:39 The Pokedex has always been ridiculous.
01:47:41 Yeah, this game's gone, like, I mean,
01:47:43 they've always had lots of dark, weird shit,
01:47:45 but this game's like kind of ramped it up even more.
01:47:47 When it's in canon described to you
01:47:50 at the Aether Foundation,
01:47:52 that there are these Pokemon that just destroy Corsulas
01:47:56 and therefore the sea is lined with bits of Corsula.
01:47:59 They tell you that.
01:48:01 And if you get into,
01:48:02 I found out that if you have that Pokemon,
01:48:05 I don't remember which one it is.
01:48:06 I think it's that new poison thing, but I'm not sure.
01:48:08 But apparently if you get into a doubles battle,
01:48:12 where like, you know, where Corsula is at low health
01:48:15 and then it calls for help,
01:48:17 that Pokemon will come down and it will kill Corsula.
01:48:20 What? Oh my God!
01:48:22 I read something similar, like with Carbink and Sableye,
01:48:25 because now Sableye apparently preys on Carbink,
01:48:28 so yeah, Carbink.
01:48:30 That's why he killed him.
01:48:32 That's why I couldn't catch that fucking asshole.
01:48:34 Wait, wait.
01:48:35 I mean, I read that Carbink will summon Sableye.
01:48:39 Wait, Sableye kills Carbink?
01:48:41 Apparently.
01:48:42 Yeah, holy shit.
01:48:44 They show up because it's low on health
01:48:46 and then just eat him.
01:48:47 Oh my fucking God.
01:48:50 That's insane. That's the coolest thing.
01:48:52 I thought it was just like a weird recoil thing.
01:48:54 I didn't pay attention to it, but now that I know,
01:48:56 Sableye ate him and then I caused a lot of pain.
01:48:58 It's completely redeemed.
01:48:59 It's completely redeemed, the summoning health pun.
01:49:02 It's still annoying.
01:49:03 I like it so cool.
01:49:06 I already liked the fact that sometimes they call for help
01:49:08 and nothing comes.
01:49:09 It's sort of like, oh God, they're crying like,
01:49:11 please don't kill me.
01:49:13 And it's like no help came.
01:49:14 All right, that's cool.
01:49:15 But like, I beat this whole fucking game
01:49:17 and nothing like this happened.
01:49:18 I didn't, they only summoned more of exactly
01:49:20 what was already there and they never fucking killed each other.
01:49:23 So fucking game.
01:49:24 You have to, like, other stuff only starts showing up
01:49:27 usually if you fought multiple.
01:49:29 The more you kill, the more the weird shit will come up.
01:49:33 It just sounds like you kind of need to be delivered.
01:49:35 You kind of need to seek the stuff out.
01:49:37 The first time carving called for help,
01:49:39 Sableye showed up, but I managed to catch the Sableye.
01:49:42 Maze, didn't you say that a Gyarados showed up
01:49:45 when you were fighting a Magikarp?
01:49:46 Yeah, my first Magikarp.
01:49:48 It's called for help.
01:49:50 Yeah, the very first time I cast the whole...
01:49:55 The old rod.
01:49:56 The rod or whatever.
01:49:57 Yeah, the rod.
01:49:58 Whatever.
01:49:59 So, and I caught a Magikarp.
01:50:01 I was like, oh, hey, a Magikarp.
01:50:02 I'm gonna catch it, but then it called for help
01:50:04 and then the Gyarados came to help it.
01:50:06 That's badass.
01:50:07 Let me try and defend the fact that it shows you
01:50:14 the moveset.
01:50:15 Because like, if it didn't show you the moveset,
01:50:17 I mean, you would just look it up, right?
01:50:20 So isn't it just like...
01:50:21 Well, you should know.
01:50:22 You should learn.
01:50:23 You should cut it out of her life.
01:50:25 Because it's already in your Pokedex.
01:50:27 Like your character has that information, right?
01:50:30 Your character has registered this Pokemon
01:50:32 in their Pokedex and knows what type it is.
01:50:35 So logically, you should be able to just pop open
01:50:37 your Pokedex and like quickly reference like,
01:50:39 oh, this will be super effective against it.
01:50:41 Well, okay, you know what sense in character.
01:50:43 It's just cutting out the incredible middleman
01:50:46 of having to fucking constantly look up
01:50:48 every single thing if you're not...
01:50:50 Okay, well, here's the thing though.
01:50:52 That's a pretty reasonable point and makes sense to me,
01:50:55 but like the fact remains,
01:50:57 it is definitely, you know,
01:50:58 simplifying the game for you and that that's okay.
01:51:00 I guess that's not a big problem.
01:51:02 It does make logical sense.
01:51:03 But then there's lots of other things like that too.
01:51:05 Like, and this has been in, I think,
01:51:06 the last game or two, like X and Y before that, I think,
01:51:10 where like now when you catch a Pokemon,
01:51:12 your Pokemon still gain it.
01:51:14 They gain experience from that battle.
01:51:15 And that also makes sense, but the trend here overall
01:51:20 does feel like they're just trying to make it as easy
01:51:22 as possible.
01:51:23 Shut up.
01:51:24 I worry about that.
01:51:25 That's stupid.
01:51:26 Well, it's already a problem.
01:51:27 Wait, wait, wait, what you just said was, yeah,
01:51:30 I was like, here's the thing, here's why it's not bad.
01:51:33 And you were like, hmm, I agree.
01:51:34 That's not that bad.
01:51:36 But let me demonstrate how the overall trend is bad
01:51:39 by giving you another example of something that isn't bad.
01:51:42 But that's true.
01:51:42 Okay, guys, guys.
01:51:43 Let Mage go, let Mage go.
01:51:45 Listen, like there's over 700 Pokemon
01:51:48 and you're probably gonna wanna switch out
01:51:50 between them every now and then.
01:51:52 So alternate ways of getting more experience
01:51:54 or knowing which type,
01:51:56 like because there's so many crazy type things as well,
01:51:58 the game kinda helping you
01:52:00 because there's so many Pokemon
01:52:01 and just so many weird ones.
01:52:03 There's no daycare,
01:52:03 so you can't leave Pokemon in this.
01:52:05 Yeah.
01:52:06 Actually, actually, there is a sort of daycare
01:52:09 and that's actually, I almost forgot about this.
01:52:11 This is a great picture.
01:52:12 I don't get an experience from it though.
01:52:13 Well, that's right.
01:52:14 There is one and you get it way later.
01:52:15 It's called the Poke Island or the Poke, whatever.
01:52:19 It's the-
01:52:20 Poke Pelago.
01:52:21 It's the coolest fucking thing in this whole game.
01:52:24 But when do you get it?
01:52:25 When do you get it?
01:52:26 Once you get the fly thing,
01:52:27 I think on the second island sometime.
01:52:29 Oh, okay.
01:52:30 I need to tell you guys what this is
01:52:31 because it's just the best thing ever
01:52:33 and Digi was absolutely right.
01:52:35 I wasn't sold on it before,
01:52:36 but now I am convinced
01:52:37 that it's one of the greatest things
01:52:38 that's been introduced in the game.
01:52:40 So what it is,
01:52:41 it's just an archipelago out at sea
01:52:42 where there are these islands that you kind of construct
01:52:44 and what happens is all the Pokemon
01:52:46 that you have in your box,
01:52:48 they just, they go and they populate those islands
01:52:51 and they do things there.
01:52:53 So like for example,
01:52:54 they help you,
01:52:55 they kind of just hang out on this one island
01:52:56 and then it just attracts new Pokemon.
01:52:58 That just instantly like join your party.
01:53:00 If they, you know, it doesn't happen too often,
01:53:02 but they'll just be attracted,
01:53:04 they'll do it and they'll come get them.
01:53:06 That kind of reminds me of the Digimon games a little bit.
01:53:10 Yeah, it's very similar to that.
01:53:11 And it's just-
01:53:12 I'm not sure how to handle that for Nuzlocke rules.
01:53:17 Yeah, I'd probably, yeah, I have no idea to do it.
01:53:20 You'll have to think about it.
01:53:22 You could just throw them away,
01:53:23 ignore them or something.
01:53:25 Actually, you know what?
01:53:25 You only get them to join your team
01:53:27 if you like tap on them twice, I think.
01:53:30 So if you just ignore them,
01:53:31 then they'll never join your team.
01:53:33 So that's, you know, that's something.
01:53:35 But there's a bunch of islands
01:53:37 that each do different things.
01:53:38 And the fact that your Pokemon in your box
01:53:42 are actually given like a life.
01:53:44 Like they don't just sit motionless in stasis
01:53:47 in a Pokeball somewhere.
01:53:48 They're just out, living life on these archipelagos.
01:53:51 I have not actually experienced it,
01:53:53 but yeah, it sounds amazing and wonderful.
01:53:58 It is wonderful.
01:53:59 I don't know what you guys all talked about.
01:54:00 I was just telling them how great the Poke-Pelago was.
01:54:03 Going on, yeah, it's really awesome.
01:54:06 I wanted to say about the gaining experience
01:54:08 from catching Pokemon thing that like,
01:54:12 I mean, if you're playing this game in such a way
01:54:14 that you're mainly keeping a main team
01:54:16 and like you're not catching a whole lot of Pokemon,
01:54:19 then that will not help you at all.
01:54:21 I mean, you're not catching enough Pokemon
01:54:23 for it to be a big deal.
01:54:24 Well, I catch all the Pokemon I find all the time.
01:54:27 Well, if you're playing such a style
01:54:29 that you're trying to catch all the Pokemon,
01:54:31 then more often than not,
01:54:32 you're catching them not fleeing from them,
01:54:35 which is a much harder thing to do
01:54:37 than actually killing Pokemon
01:54:39 because you have to strategically not kill them.
01:54:42 And so I think gaining experience from that
01:54:45 is like just, it feels way better.
01:54:48 Like I'd rather, it feels like I put more effort
01:54:51 into doing that than I did into just winning a battle.
01:54:53 And I'm glad I gained experience.
01:54:55 Could you imagine how annoying it would be
01:54:57 if you had to kill like 17 Pokemon in a row
01:55:00 that a Pokemon had called for help
01:55:02 and then not getting experience for that after you catch it?
01:55:04 Well, I mean, if a Pokemon faints,
01:55:06 obviously you should get experience.
01:55:07 Actually, yeah, you gain the experience immediately
01:55:09 after killing the fainted ones.
01:55:11 So it's not like you have to wait
01:55:14 for the end of the battle to gain more experience.
01:55:15 Oh wait, so you can level up during one of those things?
01:55:18 Yeah, yeah, it's just like any other battle.
01:55:20 You gain experience every time you knock something out.
01:55:25 Yeah, I mean, I was actually arguing with my friend, John,
01:55:28 that that was actually a good thing to have in the game.
01:55:31 So I'm kind of playing devil's advocate here
01:55:33 because I do like the inclusion
01:55:34 of getting experience when you level up.
01:55:36 It's just in the context of me worrying
01:55:38 about the games being too easy.
01:55:39 Like they didn't have to do it.
01:55:41 And so, you know, I'm kind of defending a point
01:55:44 I don't totally agree with here
01:55:45 just because of the larger context of, you know,
01:55:47 that's why we need to make what's your Tizm.
01:55:50 Even if that's true.
01:55:52 Yeah, Pokemon don't level up as quick as a bullet from a gun.
01:55:59 Man, that experience made leveling too easy.
01:56:01 Did they put in a learning curve in this game, right?
01:56:03 Am I the only one who thinks this
01:56:04 that there was like a learning curve
01:56:05 that you can't over level?
01:56:06 Because I found that trying to grind so I could beat Ben,
01:56:09 it took way longer than in other games.
01:56:13 I didn't grind, so I'm not sure.
01:56:14 Well, it took plenty longer.
01:56:17 The higher level you are compared to the Pokemon,
01:56:19 you're fighting the lower amount of experience you get,
01:56:22 which I think was the same.
01:56:24 There is EXP scaling and that was,
01:56:26 I don't think that was always the case.
01:56:28 Well, maybe not always.
01:56:29 Yeah, that's gotta be a new thing
01:56:29 because I've never seen that before.
01:56:31 It was definitely like that in Gen Five.
01:56:34 I do remember that vaguely, I think, as well.
01:56:36 Really?
01:56:37 Yeah, I was sort of like a little upset,
01:56:39 I think, when I found out about it,
01:56:41 that was years ago, though.
01:56:42 So, yeah, I think it was since Gen Five, at least.
01:56:45 Well, I have never once leveled up a Pokemon to level 100,
01:56:48 and I always wondered where people get
01:56:50 the fucking endurance to do it.
01:56:52 I've done two, but they were in Gen Five.
01:56:53 It's not hard, actually.
01:56:54 In original blue, I did.
01:56:56 How the fuck do you do it?
01:56:57 You just fucking blasted the elite four.
01:56:59 You have to do it so many times, though.
01:57:01 I've beat the elite four over 150 times on Gen Three.
01:57:06 Hell yeah.
01:57:07 To get to level.
01:57:08 That's too many.
01:57:09 That's too many times.
01:57:10 I know it is too many.
01:57:10 Once you get your Pokemon like 10 or so levels
01:57:13 above the elite four, then, I mean,
01:57:16 you can sweep it with one Pokemon.
01:57:18 So it's just gaining all the experience.
01:57:19 I did it in X and Y with Garchomp
01:57:22 just because I was just EXP sharing
01:57:24 for everything else in my party
01:57:26 because I was trying to catch every Pokemon.
01:57:27 So I just go in there with five low-level guys,
01:57:29 sweep the entire thing with Garchomp.
01:57:32 He gains a little bit more than everybody else,
01:57:34 and they all level up fucking all the way
01:57:36 into the stratosphere.
01:57:37 And I just, in just the course of trying
01:57:40 to get all the Pokemon evolved,
01:57:42 I ended up with the level 100 Garchomp.
01:57:45 And Nate, if you're concerned about the time,
01:57:46 you can just play it on an emulator
01:57:48 and fucking throttle through that shit in three hours.
01:57:51 Yeah.
01:57:52 Monkey.
01:57:53 I played White Two on an emulator,
01:57:56 which had a speed-up function,
01:57:57 but I didn't realize it until I was seven gyms in.
01:58:00 Oh my God.
01:58:01 So I played it normally up until the eighth gym,
01:58:04 and then I finally realized I could hold out.
01:58:08 I just did the normal way.
01:58:09 Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
01:58:11 Like a fucking sucker.
01:58:12 Was this in White Two?
01:58:13 Every recording for one of an episode of Ben's Nuzlocke
01:58:16 is like, you know, like six to 12 hours long.
01:58:20 It's no wonder why his series went on for half a year.
01:58:24 It was like three.
01:58:24 That's just because Ben's release schedule.
01:58:27 One of my favorite things to do is to get like a level,
01:58:30 like if there's an old Pokemon in an earlier area
01:58:33 that I hadn't caught yet, and I need to evolve it,
01:58:36 and it's like level two,
01:58:37 I bring it to the Elite Four and I give it the XP share,
01:58:39 and I can see it level up like 50 in a row.
01:58:43 Yeah, that's great to see.
01:58:44 How about the XP share?
01:58:45 The XP share made it so that
01:58:47 I didn't even think about playing this game.
01:58:49 I just used whatever Pokemon I always used
01:58:52 and just fucking didn't worry about switching.
01:58:54 Just killed everything in one hit,
01:58:56 leveled up.
01:58:57 I do like the XP share that keeps your party
01:59:00 the same sort of level because, I mean,
01:59:04 it's like you have your Pokemon that have the good moves
01:59:08 for fighting specific other types,
01:59:11 but sometimes you're in a place where, you know,
01:59:13 your flying Pokemon is useless against everything there,
01:59:15 but you need it for the next area,
01:59:17 and you don't want to have to grind just with the flying
01:59:19 Pokemon in another area because it's useless here.
01:59:22 You can use your useful Pokemon in the right place,
01:59:25 and then switch out when you need a different type,
01:59:28 and they're all generally the same level
01:59:29 if you use the XP share, and I like that.
01:59:31 It's good.
01:59:32 My team is all the same cool level guy.
01:59:36 I guess.
01:59:37 I don't really like the idea of my Pokemon being strong
01:59:39 despite never actually seeing a real battle.
01:59:41 Something about that rubs me the wrong way.
01:59:43 Well, Ben, I've got a question for you, Ben.
01:59:45 You do love the grind, though,
01:59:46 and I don't like it quite as much.
01:59:48 Yeah, Ben, have you been getting a shit ton of comments
01:59:51 on the Nuzlocke of people calling you a pussy
01:59:53 for using the XP share?
01:59:54 Because I certainly have, these fucking babies.
01:59:57 I got one guy, he was like, customarily,
02:00:01 it's customary to not use a key share or a me.
02:00:06 I think he was referring to Pokemon Refresh.
02:00:08 I was like, first of all, customary according to who?
02:00:10 Second of all, shut up.
02:00:14 These fucking entitled babies in the comments
02:00:16 think they can run my game.
02:00:17 The idea that there are Pokemon customs.
02:00:20 Monkey, you said it in your fucking video.
02:00:22 That doesn't make the game more challenging,
02:00:24 it just makes it grindier.
02:00:25 It makes it tedious, that's not fun to watch.
02:00:29 It's just more shit on the cutting room floor for me.
02:00:31 And speaking of having authority over your channels,
02:00:36 Ben, you released your Nuzlocke far too irregularly.
02:00:39 Once a week is not good enough, but they're fucking hour long.
02:00:42 Didn't make them half an hour long.
02:00:44 You need to release twice a week at least.
02:00:46 Why?
02:00:47 Because I said so, because I do edit.
02:00:49 Ben, here's why.
02:00:50 Because you and me are trying to upload our battles
02:00:52 on the same day, and it makes it very weird to schedule
02:00:56 when you only do it once a fucking week.
02:00:58 Yes, there you go.
02:00:59 No, but it's fine.
02:01:03 It worked out this first time,
02:01:04 but we got like 18 more of these battles to go.
02:01:08 I mean, you could easily break those episodes in half.
02:01:11 They are longest shit.
02:01:12 How would that make it any better?
02:01:14 Because I don't want to watch a movie
02:01:15 every time you have a new episode.
02:01:17 I want to watch it day by day.
02:01:19 Why?
02:01:22 I'm looking for more content per week.
02:01:24 There's pros and cons to the different lengths.
02:01:26 I get more views, which is more money.
02:01:29 When it comes to having to...
02:01:30 I don't monetize any of my videos.
02:01:31 Oh, when it comes to why?
02:01:33 Because I would get like a dollar for each one.
02:01:36 It's a fucking dollar.
02:01:37 I don't want a dollar.
02:01:39 Talking about fucking money, it's when you've got two people
02:01:42 doing like a Nuzlocke side by side,
02:01:44 it's kind of weird to have like Ben's come out a week
02:01:47 and then for Monkey to have a regular interval.
02:01:50 So you're more Monkey's playthrough is more in your mind.
02:01:54 And then suddenly there's another Ben one.
02:01:56 Yeah.
02:01:57 And you sort of forget what happened in the Ben one
02:01:58 while you're watching the Monkey ones.
02:01:59 Yeah, Monkey's in their mind.
02:02:01 It's gonna be weird.
02:02:02 That's all I'm...
02:02:03 Well, you got to win the battle of hearts and minds here, Ben.
02:02:05 I don't think...
02:02:06 No, guys, guys, I like events video length
02:02:10 because personally, like when I watch videos,
02:02:12 I usually do other stuff like let's say draws.
02:02:14 So I like lengthy videos
02:02:16 because that means more time for me to draw
02:02:18 rather than click on the next video.
02:02:20 That's really been annoying.
02:02:22 I agree with you, Mage.
02:02:23 To long and short videos.
02:02:25 I'm just saying with the two different players,
02:02:27 they should be the same length.
02:02:28 Hey, it's not about the size of the video,
02:02:30 it's how you use it.
02:02:31 Well, to say that, I think what Mage is saying
02:02:35 is how I feel as well,
02:02:36 but I also think that that's kind of a bad thing for Ben
02:02:39 because you're saying that you like his videos being longer
02:02:42 because it means you don't have to watch the video.
02:02:45 No, I'm watching it.
02:02:46 It's on the side and my drawing is on the other side,
02:02:50 so I'm watching it while drawing.
02:02:52 I've mentioned this to Ben before that with Mumkis,
02:02:56 I actually just watch each episode
02:02:59 and it's because typically what I do is I'll come home
02:03:03 with a sandwich and then I will sit and eat the sandwich
02:03:07 and watch Mumkis' video.
02:03:08 It's just the right length for me to finish my sandwich
02:03:11 before the video's over.
02:03:12 Whereas with Ben's videos,
02:03:14 I almost always just listen to them and I'll glance up,
02:03:18 like with the latest one,
02:03:19 it was helpful because I was actually playing Pokemon,
02:03:22 so it was a good way to have an hour and a half long thing
02:03:25 to have in the background while I was playing,
02:03:27 but I probably would never just sit and watch
02:03:31 an hour and a half long Let's Play video
02:03:33 the way I would with Mumkis' 20 minute ones
02:03:37 and I'm just like, yeah, all right,
02:03:39 it's exactly long enough to finish a sandwich.
02:03:41 Did you, it's funny that you say that, did you?
02:03:43 Because every time you upload a new decompression chamber,
02:03:46 I always jerk off to it.
02:03:50 Yeah, that's a fucking long goddamn jack-off.
02:03:53 The long, slow pumps, dude, that's the way to do it.
02:03:55 Yeah, that's cool that we do our everyday tasks
02:03:59 while watching each other's shitty videos.
02:04:01 I'll be honest, I don't...
02:04:03 Mumkis sitting there, to take so long,
02:04:06 I feel like you're here so fast, I can jack my whole...
02:04:12 Do you want to say something?
02:04:15 Something about lengths of videos.
02:04:18 I actually didn't mean to bring up any of that.
02:04:22 I just need to get more content out.
02:04:24 I like long videos, which is why I made mine the way they are,
02:04:29 because that's the kind of video that I prefer.
02:04:31 This is what I was going to say.
02:04:32 I'll be honest, I don't watch either of them.
02:04:35 I listen to both of them, regardless of the length.
02:04:38 I glance at them every so often.
02:04:40 Yeah, I mostly just keep mumkis tabbed
02:04:44 unless I hear something of particular interest happening,
02:04:46 and then I tab over.
02:04:47 If you don't see every single growl at the scene,
02:04:49 you're missing something.
02:04:51 I mean, I always tab over, I always flip over for them.
02:04:53 Yeah, you have to watch the growl at the scene
02:04:55 every time to get the full mumky experience.
02:04:57 By the way...
02:04:58 That will absolutely have been the intro for this video, by the way.
02:05:02 Yeah!
02:05:03 But finally, one something.
02:05:05 The thing is, I mean, I like my upload schedule.
02:05:08 It's easier for me, because...
02:05:10 You only have to edit once a week, yeah, that makes sense.
02:05:13 Yeah, all you gotta do is edit once a week
02:05:16 and then split it into two files.
02:05:17 But then you have to process it and upload it,
02:05:19 and didgy's internet fucking sucks, it's a hassle.
02:05:22 Well, first of all, my internet's great,
02:05:24 and second of all, I render all this fucking video, so...
02:05:28 My concern, by the way,
02:05:29 was only about you two getting it out at the same time.
02:05:32 But it sounds like you've already got that figured out,
02:05:34 so never mind what I was saying.
02:05:35 Dude, I don't think that's a problem
02:05:37 with getting it out at the same time,
02:05:38 because we are like...
02:05:39 The plan was that three of his episodes would be one of mine.
02:05:44 That's true.
02:05:45 We planned it out ahead of time.
02:05:46 I was like...
02:05:48 Yeah, we decided that it would be two episodes for me
02:05:52 and six for him.
02:05:54 So...
02:05:54 I like that Ben's are long, though,
02:05:56 because I don't have to make a decision
02:05:57 about which one I'm gonna eat my sandwich through.
02:06:00 Like, Ben's can come out once a week,
02:06:03 and I can just focus on that,
02:06:05 whereas on the day-to-day grind of me eating sandwiches,
02:06:08 which is pretty common, you know?
02:06:10 Like, as I wouldn't be able to eat the sandwich
02:06:12 through both of your episodes, you know?
02:06:14 The reason I would like your videos to be the same length
02:06:17 is so that I can watch both of them exactly at the same time.
02:06:20 Yeah.
02:06:21 Unlike me.
02:06:21 I'm like, double screen.
02:06:23 Yeah, double screen,
02:06:24 and not know what I'm looking at.
02:06:28 Have one person's audio come through one headphone
02:06:31 and the other guy through the other?
02:06:32 Yeah.
02:06:33 And then eat two sandwiches.
02:06:35 Yes.
02:06:36 Yes, yes, double fisting.
02:06:37 One meatball and one turkey,
02:06:40 the double meat on a nine-grain wheat,
02:06:45 double meat, turkey, lettuce, tomato.
02:06:49 What was the rest of it, monkey?
02:06:50 I don't remember.
02:06:51 It was never revealed,
02:06:52 and then Manim will quit the channel,
02:06:54 but I think, I mean, if you guys want me to spoil
02:06:56 what was on his Subway sandwich, I'll do it here live.
02:06:59 Oh, I'll do it, too.
02:06:59 By all means.
02:07:00 Oh, my God.
02:07:01 A PCP exclusive.
02:07:03 If you want all your viewers to watch this episode,
02:07:05 if you're like trying to convince them,
02:07:07 just tell them you finally revealed it.
02:07:09 No, we've got to pay all this one.
02:07:14 Pay all this one section.
02:07:16 All right, dude.
02:07:16 Slap that on the tape.
02:07:17 If you want to hear the next crucial minute of this PCP.
02:07:21 You have to go to patreon.com slash mumkey.
02:07:23 Donate $20 per month, and you'll get this.
02:07:25 No, no, no, it's the other one.
02:07:27 No Ben St. Patreon, so I'm not completely sure,
02:07:32 but as far as I know, the other two ingredients
02:07:34 are onions and banana peppers.
02:07:38 Oh, my God.
02:07:39 Oh, my God.
02:07:40 Holy shit.
02:07:41 So wait, Skain, you go through all of it?
02:07:44 Yeah.
02:07:45 Pay me a picture.
02:07:45 So you get the nine-grain wheat.
02:07:47 Right, yes.
02:07:48 Not toasted, because then the bread gets all crumbly
02:07:50 and shit.
02:07:51 Right.
02:07:52 I don't even remember what fucking cheese.
02:07:53 What was it?
02:07:55 That's cruel.
02:07:56 Oh, I don't remember.
02:07:57 American, it's American cheese.
02:07:58 No, it wasn't American, no.
02:07:59 Not American?
02:08:00 Provolone?
02:08:02 Pepperjack, I don't know.
02:08:03 It wasn't pepperjack.
02:08:04 I think it might have been provolone cheese,
02:08:05 which this is why I was confused why I didn't toast it,
02:08:08 because if you don't toast the cheese,
02:08:09 it's just a fucking, it's a cold piece of cheese, disgusting.
02:08:12 He gets double turkey, double turkey.
02:08:15 He gets lettuce, and now we all know he gets onions
02:08:19 and banana peppers.
02:08:20 That's how you eat Subway sandwich,
02:08:22 and specifically, no tomato.
02:08:23 No tomato.
02:08:24 We both hate tomato very much.
02:08:26 Was there any sauce on it?
02:08:28 Yeah, he said Subway vinaigrette, I think.
02:08:31 That's crucial.
02:08:32 Okay, yeah, all right, so that's it.
02:08:34 Now I can finally go order it,
02:08:36 like ever since he first brought it up,
02:08:38 I was like, as soon as they finished describing the Sub,
02:08:41 I'm gonna go buy one and watch the show,
02:08:43 and it's been fucking three months.
02:08:47 Digi, I want one too, I'm coming with you,
02:08:49 I'm gonna get one too.
02:08:50 We should do that right after the show.
02:08:51 I haven't watched episode four.
02:08:52 No, let's do it after we lift,
02:08:55 because I'm still full.
02:08:56 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:08:57 Yeah, I've gotta warn you, if you eat the animal way,
02:08:59 you're gonna get big and bloated like him.
02:09:01 Well, you know, Ben, we should buy them,
02:09:04 and we should buy them before we lift,
02:09:06 put them in the fridge,
02:09:07 and then run the constant risk of monkey
02:09:09 eating the other half of our Sub.
02:09:11 That's the full experience.
02:09:18 Yeah.
02:09:19 If you walk in and DeVoo has just devoured it all,
02:09:20 at my street, the curse.
02:09:23 That's why it's called DeVoo, he devours it.
02:09:25 He devours it, yeah.
02:09:27 Hey, that's pretty good.
02:09:29 Does anybody have any more comments about this game?
02:09:30 This is two hours.
02:09:31 I think we've hit rock bottom.
02:09:34 What's that supposed to mean?
02:09:37 I like Pokemon, they're cute.
02:09:39 Usually.
02:09:40 Why am I white and my mom is brown?
02:09:42 That's a good question.
02:09:43 Your dad must be super white.
02:09:45 My game didn't have that problem.
02:09:47 Oh, I thought you were talking about yourself, Ben.
02:09:49 I was like, what the fuck?
02:09:52 It has been a struggle of identity our entire lives.
02:09:55 Did you make your girl brown?
02:09:57 Yeah.
02:09:58 I've seen my video, haven't you?
02:09:59 Where I showed off my fucking girl and how cool she is.
02:10:01 I guess.
02:10:02 I had no brightness reference.
02:10:04 It's the best fucking video I've ever made.
02:10:07 What channel is that uploaded on?
02:10:08 I didn't see that.
02:10:09 Did you, bro, after dark?
02:10:10 It's called Pokemon Trainer Sheik.
02:10:13 The Winter Look.
02:10:15 Yeah, the Winter Look, Winter 2016 Look.
02:10:17 Is there any way of me analyzing
02:10:19 how fucking cute my outfit is?
02:10:21 Is there any way for me to get a winter knit cap
02:10:25 and those sunglasses?
02:10:27 Possibly.
02:10:29 I mean, you start with a winter knit cap.
02:10:31 No, you don't.
02:10:32 You start with a fucking baseball.
02:10:33 Well, Ben's a girl.
02:10:35 As a girl, you start with a cap.
02:10:37 Ben, I don't know.
02:10:38 I've only seen baseball hats, though.
02:10:40 But I'm going to look into this.
02:10:41 I mean, there is no winter clothes.
02:10:43 It's the whole game is all fucking island clothes.
02:10:45 Even though you go to a fucking place,
02:10:46 you mount it a couple times.
02:10:47 Yeah.
02:10:48 But what the fuck?
02:10:50 But yeah, I made that and also an hour and a half
02:10:52 long analysis of Pokemon Sun.
02:10:54 So if anyone listening to this wants to hear a more
02:10:56 structured analysis of the game, I can't believe I had to talk
02:11:00 for another two hours.
02:11:01 Much more structured.
02:11:03 It was, I mean, it was like bullet pointed.
02:11:05 I had fucking full notes for it.
02:11:07 Did you?
02:11:08 Yeah.
02:11:09 The whole thing is like point by point.
02:11:11 Highly doubtful.
02:11:14 I was doing it in the GRPJ style.
02:11:17 I was like trying to.
02:11:18 Oh, that's right.
02:11:19 Yeah, go to go to Hippocrite.com.
02:11:22 I, you know, I deliver a point in watching that.
02:11:25 I avoid watching that because I hadn't beaten the game.
02:11:28 But now that I have, I'll probably go check it out.
02:11:30 Did you do the green screen?
02:11:31 Tell me you did the green screen.
02:11:32 No, I was too lazy for that.
02:11:34 I, I use green sunglasses.
02:11:37 I use the fact that I didn't screen as a way to advertise Hippo more
02:11:42 by assuring the audience that if they watched him,
02:11:44 they'd get this, but better, like with, you know,
02:11:46 like more effort put in.
02:11:48 So have you guys seen that Hippocrite video where he's like
02:11:51 no, I didn't watch the review and he had like this guy who's playing
02:11:55 a guard and he has a big cane and he's taken the key off of him.
02:11:59 And it's really funny.
02:12:00 And I laughed at it.
02:12:01 Yeah, I've seen that video.
02:12:03 And you guys see the Hippocrite video when his guitar comes
02:12:06 in character and it starts crying and it was really funny.
02:12:09 Yeah, we get that picture.
02:12:11 He gives videos are great.
02:12:12 So we've seen that mage video.
02:12:14 All right.
02:12:15 Mage wants us to wrap this up.
02:12:16 Let's finish this off.
02:12:20 OK, well, that that's pretty much it.
02:12:22 We've run the full gamut.
02:12:23 Everything there is to say about this shit.
02:12:25 We talked about it.
02:12:27 Yeah, I think we can say a solid zero out of ten on Pokemon.
02:12:31 So I think we can all agree that this can, should, must
02:12:37 and will be the last Pokemon game.
02:12:39 No, yeah.
02:12:40 No, every three years, I want a new generation.
02:12:44 Everybody say goodbye.
02:12:46 Bye.
02:12:47 Hashtag Team Monkey, baby.
02:12:50 Yeah.
02:12:52 I'm supposed to be working right now.
02:12:57 I'm supposed to be working right now.
02:13:03 But I'm not working.
02:13:06 I'm doing nothing.
02:13:08 My dick, I'm jerking.
02:13:11 Myself, I'm sucking.
02:13:14 I am an asshole.
02:13:16 I am a stupid.
02:13:19 I've got a deadline.
02:13:22 Don't want to do it.
02:13:32 What the hell is wrong with me?
02:13:35 I'm supposed to be making money.
02:13:40 I'm supposed to be creating funny things that the people
02:13:48 gladly will pay for.
02:13:51 Artist and genius, that's what they came for.
02:13:56 Instead, I'm tweeting.
02:13:59 Hashtag repeating.
02:14:01 That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling.
02:14:08 Yeah, it's quite the burden.
02:14:12 It's a hard knock life.
02:14:15 Being a genius.
