00:00:00 Uh, do you think you would ever consider coming back to Game Grumps in the future?
00:00:03 Unfortunately, I don't think...
00:00:06 No, I won't be returning to the Game Grumps.
00:00:08 Sorry.
00:00:10 That's a fine word.
00:00:18 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast,
00:00:23 a podcast about a bunch of people on the internet who do shit there talking about garbage.
00:00:29 I'm the best guy ever and today we're joined by Tom Oliver.
00:01:00 You'll all pay for this!
00:01:01 I've got 4,700 followers on Twitter and each and every one of them has a sniper rifle
00:01:08 trained on your location.
00:01:10 This isn't about ethics and podcast journalism, this is about harassment of me.
00:01:16 I've got some drama for you, a drama's into your fucking house and breaks all your legs,
00:01:21 every single one of them.
00:01:23 These are all death threats.
00:01:25 I'm sending this all to the cyber police.
00:01:27 The next draw cast is going to be more like a PCP drama cast.
00:01:35 Leave Brittany alone.
00:01:37 Hello, thank you everyone for joining us on this very special episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast,
00:01:42 all about drama.
00:01:43 All about drama.
00:01:44 It's many forms.
00:01:45 The thing we like the most in the entire world, as is evident.
00:01:48 That's correct.
00:01:50 That's correct.
00:01:50 And before we get into it, let's read that old Urban Dictionary definition here.
00:01:55 Drama, definition number two, making a big deal out of something unnecessarily.
00:02:01 That bitch, I'm going to kick her ass.
00:02:03 Dag, Jenny, all she did was look at you.
00:02:06 Why you got to be so drama?
00:02:08 Wow.
00:02:09 There you go.
00:02:09 Thanks Urban Dictionary.
00:02:11 You're beautiful.
00:02:12 You're fantastic.
00:02:12 You said it all.
00:02:15 It's even more and more evident that the Urban Dictionary is actually just the ebonics
00:02:18 dictionary for when you want to go into the...
00:02:21 That is what it means by...
00:02:22 Learn about the Urban Demographic and you're going to go in, quote, the hood.
00:02:26 We're going to start some drama already right off the bat because we only introduced me
00:02:30 and Nate and no one else got introduced.
00:02:32 We just went right into the fucking podcast.
00:02:35 You're trying to throw me under the bus, Nate.
00:02:36 You're trying to throw your own brother under the bus.
00:02:38 I get it.
00:02:39 It's a pup to play.
00:02:41 It's the upper class and the lower class divided by being introduced and that.
00:02:45 I finally joined the bourgeois where I belong.
00:02:47 God, it feels great.
00:02:48 I'm from fucking proletariat revolt, in my opinion.
00:02:51 Just shit talking podcast hosts for half an hour.
00:02:54 Oh, God, what have I done?
00:02:57 It's time to seize the means of production.
00:03:00 We're locking you all out of the Patreon.
00:03:01 We're taking...
00:03:02 Come on, no!
00:03:03 Here's a cheapo triple introduction.
00:03:06 We've got Digi Bro, Munchy Warsh Tiny Hats, and Ben St. Say Words.
00:03:09 It's me, Munchy Warsh Tiny Hats.
00:03:11 I've never been in drama before.
00:03:15 I've never been in pajamas before.
00:03:16 It's me, Digi Bro.
00:03:18 I've been in all the drama before.
00:03:22 He's very popular.
00:03:23 He's very well versed.
00:03:24 I'm Ben St. and everyone likes me.
00:03:30 All right, team.
00:03:30 So drama, it's not even real.
00:03:34 It's not even something that happens in the real world.
00:03:36 It's some fantasy that happens online that isn't true and is fake.
00:03:41 So what do you have to say to that shit right there?
00:03:44 Internet drama sucks, but real life drama is great because...
00:03:49 Yeah, like the fucking Civil War?
00:03:50 Yeah, exactly.
00:03:52 That's exactly what I unironically mean.
00:03:55 Whenever there's internet drama, it's like,
00:03:57 Oh, PewDiePie said nigger, like,
00:03:58 Oh God, fucking cry me a river.
00:04:00 But whatever, one of my friends does something.
00:04:03 Munchy says that to me every second of what you did.
00:04:05 Get over it at this point.
00:04:07 And I beg for more.
00:04:08 When I sleep, I'm like...
00:04:14 But whenever there's something that happens in real life,
00:04:16 I'm like, yes, I can finally talk shit about this person.
00:04:18 No one will get mad at me when I do.
00:04:20 I feel like that's a big excuse.
00:04:23 That is such a great point, Munchy.
00:04:25 That is what...
00:04:27 In some ways, I love drama for exactly that reason, which is that
00:04:32 there are some people that basically...
00:04:34 I hate that they're in my life,
00:04:36 but there's no excuse to get rid of them yet.
00:04:39 You're constantly harboring this like,
00:04:41 Oh, fucking that guy.
00:04:42 Like, you always come kind of like...
00:04:44 You always pull your friends aside.
00:04:45 Like, have you noticed that that dude's fucking like a piece of shit?
00:04:48 And they're like, I don't know what kind of notice.
00:04:51 And you're like, I feel like I've really...
00:04:53 Like, didn't you notice he did that?
00:04:54 And they're like, well, I guess.
00:04:56 And you're like, fuck, man.
00:04:57 And you're just waiting for the day that they fucking step over the line.
00:05:03 And then it's just like, all right, I knew it.
00:05:05 You know, it's like, I knew it.
00:05:07 I knew this was a problem.
00:05:09 Now let's get it all out.
00:05:10 Let's get it all out there.
00:05:11 This is hyper-realistic.
00:05:13 This is too realistic.
00:05:15 This has too many graphics.
00:05:17 I love Monkey Jones.
00:05:19 I love Monkey Jones.
00:05:20 God damn it!
00:05:22 I'm just popping that bubble right now.
00:05:24 There it is, there it is.
00:05:25 That's not even close to what I was thinking.
00:05:27 That's not who I was thinking about at all.
00:05:32 You guys don't even know how much fucking drama I have.
00:05:36 I got drama with everybody.
00:05:38 Offline, online, I always got drama.
00:05:40 We get drag into your drama all the goddamn time.
00:05:44 Yes.
00:05:45 Sometimes, sometimes.
00:05:46 Well, more lately than in The Bed is True.
00:05:50 Shitstormed by association.
00:05:52 It's fantastic.
00:05:53 But okay, we can talk about some of these stuff,
00:05:55 but really we're here to talk about the meta-concept of drama.
00:05:58 And it's the place in the world.
00:05:58 That's the important part.
00:06:00 Yeah, indeed.
00:06:01 Indeed.
00:06:01 And yeah, it's like, drama, when it doesn't affect me
00:06:08 or the people I know specifically, I don't really
00:06:12 concern myself with.
00:06:13 And whenever I see really epic and funny tweets
00:06:17 with Hollywood actors saying cool things in TV shows
00:06:21 with impact text over them, reacting to some pedophile
00:06:24 coming out as a pedophile, pretty good, doesn't really
00:06:28 matter to me.
00:06:29 I don't really care about that.
00:06:30 But when it's the real people in your real life,
00:06:33 and you get to finally just air out all of your greed,
00:06:36 you get to have the air of grievances,
00:06:38 then I truly enjoy it greatly.
00:06:40 Oh, boy.
00:06:41 Let me tell you a story.
00:06:42 I'm with you.
00:06:42 Let me tell you about the story about a guy.
00:06:44 I've codenamed him D on the internet, usually,
00:06:47 when I bring him up.
00:06:48 But I also say his real name Derek all the time,
00:06:50 so I don't know why I bought it.
00:06:51 All right, this dude was a member of my group of friends
00:06:55 for a very long time, like six years.
00:06:57 And he was a guy who he knew from Japanese class,
00:07:00 and he was just kind of all the intellectuals gathered.
00:07:03 Yeah, exactly.
00:07:05 Most of my friends, I met the Japanese class.
00:07:06 But he would come over to my house,
00:07:08 and he was always kind of a shitty house guest.
00:07:10 He complained about my music.
00:07:12 He'd be very demanding.
00:07:13 He would want you to almost acquiesce
00:07:16 to what he wanted while he was in my house.
00:07:19 But he also regarded my house as a paradise on earth,
00:07:21 because he hated being at home,
00:07:23 and we were so loose in free form that he loved hanging it out.
00:07:27 But he wasn't the best guy to have around, you know?
00:07:30 So he super wants to be everybody's friend,
00:07:32 but everyone's kind of tepid about having him around.
00:07:36 But he's into some good stuff.
00:07:39 He likes some good animes, some good music here and there.
00:07:43 He likes drinking.
00:07:44 So I hung out with him, you know, a pretty decent amount.
00:07:46 But as time went on, he would just do so much annoying shit.
00:07:50 And gradually, it got to a point
00:07:52 where everyone else in my group of friends
00:07:54 would just hang out and shit talk Derek.
00:07:56 Like, that was our main pastime.
00:07:58 Because it had gotten so bad,
00:08:00 but he'd never done any one thing that was like,
00:08:03 let's never talk to him again.
00:08:05 Like, it's hard to cut somebody out of your life entirely, you know?
00:08:08 It's hard to just be like, you know,
00:08:11 you don't have enough redeeming quality.
00:08:12 And like, especially when they want to be your friend,
00:08:15 when like they want to be, like he totally wanted to be around.
00:08:18 And, but like people would constantly have fucking,
00:08:21 even my parents would shit talk him.
00:08:24 Because he pissed them off so many times.
00:08:26 He would say like weird shit on Facebook, piss off my mom.
00:08:30 And we got to a point where my mom was like,
00:08:31 if he does one more thing, I'm kicking him out, right?
00:08:35 And we were all like waiting.
00:08:37 Like everyone's like, oh man, I hope he fucks up one more time.
00:08:41 So my mom could kick him out.
00:08:42 But he wasn't doing anything.
00:08:44 And then finally, on Christmas day.
00:08:46 Oh my god, yeah.
00:08:47 He says something off color.
00:08:50 He fucking had the audacity to be Jewish on Christmas.
00:08:53 That was the last fucking straw.
00:08:55 He, my brother Victor had been talking
00:08:58 to a younger cousin of ours for a while.
00:09:00 He was kind of like mentoring her.
00:09:02 And Derek says, Derek says to Victor
00:09:06 that Victor's other good friend had said something
00:09:11 about Victor like wanting to fuck this cousin, essentially.
00:09:14 How old was this cousin?
00:09:15 How old was this girl?
00:09:16 Young.
00:09:17 She was like 14.
00:09:17 Okay, okay.
00:09:18 So Victor was like probably 18 or 19 at the time.
00:09:21 Sounds ripe.
00:09:22 Sounds nice and ripe.
00:09:22 Okay, go on.
00:09:24 Don't, don't.
00:09:27 So Derek says that another friend has said this about Victor.
00:09:33 Victor, whether Victor doesn't care whether that's true or not,
00:09:36 the fact that Derek has brought that up at all,
00:09:38 like called that into question at all,
00:09:40 has infuriated him massively.
00:09:41 So he goes, tears into him.
00:09:43 He's like, fuck you.
00:09:44 I don't want to see you again for like,
00:09:46 he was like, I don't want to see your face
00:09:48 for the next six months.
00:09:49 You know, and like basically kicked him out.
00:09:51 And everybody was just like, ah,
00:09:52 and it literally ended drama in my circle of friends.
00:09:57 Like it was all gone.
00:09:58 Like all of the drama, everything anybody was complaining about,
00:10:01 all of it was sourced by this one dude.
00:10:04 And as soon as he was gone, it was like,
00:10:05 oh, like we can live again.
00:10:08 And this is why drama can be beautiful,
00:10:10 because it can have results.
00:10:11 You don't want to be the person that the drama centers around.
00:10:16 You know, like, that's not a good look.
00:10:18 Like some, some people, some people seem to like,
00:10:21 kind of like drama and get off on it
00:10:23 and find like pleasure in starting shit.
00:10:25 But like to me, that's like-
00:10:26 Didn't we all just admit to that tacitly?
00:10:28 Well, sure.
00:10:29 And more or less.
00:10:30 It's not that I enjoy starting shit.
00:10:32 It's that I enjoy ending shit.
00:10:34 I'm talking about, I'm talking about Derek.
00:10:36 Well, actually, no, I'm not even talking about anyone.
00:10:37 I'm just talking about, you know,
00:10:38 there are some people who stir up drama
00:10:40 because it's, it scratches some itch that they need.
00:10:43 It like gives meaning to their life in some way.
00:10:45 It gives them, it gives them something to do when they're bored.
00:10:47 I'm a big one.
00:10:48 Oh, go ahead.
00:10:49 But, but, but, you know, it's, it's draining.
00:10:52 It's draining on the people around you.
00:10:53 And if you are a person like that,
00:10:55 like other people are gonna, if they know what's good for them,
00:10:58 they're gonna, they're gonna cut you out
00:10:59 because you're a source of problems.
00:11:00 And like to me, I think that even if
00:11:03 even if shit's going on, it's better.
00:11:05 If you can help it, don't fucking turn it into drama
00:11:08 and make it everyone else's problem.
00:11:10 That is a bad look.
00:11:11 And I do not appreciate it.
00:11:13 Yeah.
00:11:13 The thing that interests me about drama
00:11:15 is drama is like a tool that like, I don't know,
00:11:19 like like the worthless people of society can, excuse me,
00:11:23 fuck, can wield against like people who actually matter.
00:11:27 So like the way that people can like start gossip about like,
00:11:30 like, like, it's kind of like Jesse's situation recently,
00:11:33 you know, like people just talking shit about Jesse forever.
00:11:35 And it just, it's just an example of this idea
00:11:38 about how people can, can talk about stuff like that
00:11:42 and, and just make it into a big deal
00:11:44 whether or not it was in the first place.
00:11:46 And I, it's, it's this kind of lever of power
00:11:48 that people have.
00:11:48 Better example, the PewDiePie Nazi thing,
00:11:52 where it was just, it's just a bunch of old media fuckboys
00:11:56 trying to fuck over the famous guy.
00:11:58 Exactly.
00:11:59 They're like, oh, that guy's got 14 billion subs.
00:12:02 Let's take him fucking down a peg.
00:12:04 More than the population of the earth.
00:12:06 Yeah.
00:12:07 It's interesting you bring that up.
00:12:08 There's like this really interesting video series
00:12:10 that this guy did about that whole controversy
00:12:13 and saying how like all, like the two,
00:12:16 I think it was like NBC and the Wall Street Journal
00:12:18 or something were the two things that initially reported on this.
00:12:21 And they're both owned by Rupert Murdoch.
00:12:24 So they were, he was saying like, doing this deep dive,
00:12:26 like actually had nothing to do with PewDiePie.
00:12:28 It was all an elaborate plan by old media
00:12:31 to make YouTube look like shit.
00:12:33 So all the advertisers would pull out
00:12:34 to make them relevant again.
00:12:35 Hey.
00:12:36 It was like, it was like an hour long expose.
00:12:38 It was super fucking interesting.
00:12:41 And it worked.
00:12:41 Yeah, it worked fantastically.
00:12:43 So like, oh, Ben, I have a question for you.
00:12:45 And this isn't an accusation.
00:12:47 It's just that with something legitimately,
00:12:48 I'm legitimately interested in what you just said.
00:12:51 How, how do you, and I'm not like,
00:12:54 how would you explain away the fact
00:12:56 that you take that stance on drama
00:12:58 and then the whole Rowdy fuckers cop killers?
00:13:01 Like, okay, we need to bring in fans
00:13:03 aboard to consult on this issue.
00:13:05 Yeah, yeah, let me, let me just go summon him.
00:13:07 I'm just going to summon him.
00:13:08 Strawberry!
00:13:09 I'm sweeping.
00:13:10 Oh, I'm, oh, I'm, but I'm here now.
00:13:12 Let me, let me, let me just pick up,
00:13:13 let me just pick up my like my magic,
00:13:15 my magic fairy wand and do a little like,
00:13:17 like magical girl transformation into fans porn.
00:13:20 Like I always do.
00:13:20 It's the little toilet paper roll.
00:13:22 After you've taken a shit,
00:13:23 your toilet paper roll like Dover is the magic.
00:13:24 It's like a scepter.
00:13:25 It's like a scepter with like a glowing like jewel on the,
00:13:28 anyway.
00:13:29 Yeah.
00:13:29 Okay.
00:13:29 I'm fine.
00:13:31 There's like a box next to my desk.
00:13:32 They just have to like,
00:13:33 like poke the inside pink lizard with a cane
00:13:35 and like fucking like,
00:13:36 drum his head and like beat the shit out of them
00:13:38 to wake him up.
00:13:39 It's like, it's like those old,
00:13:40 it's like those old Power Rangers transform.
00:13:42 Like in the first season of Transformers,
00:13:44 when they like wake up the dinosaurs
00:13:45 and they lumber out of their ancient slumber.
00:13:47 I'd assume, I'd assume the transformation
00:13:48 for bed would work.
00:13:49 He'd run into a public restroom,
00:13:51 go into a stall,
00:13:53 get a roll of toilet paper,
00:13:55 stick it on his head,
00:13:56 and that would start the transformation.
00:13:58 Hold on.
00:13:58 Yeah.
00:13:58 And then it just,
00:14:00 what?
00:14:00 For canonical clarity's sake,
00:14:01 are you implying that Phantom Horn only exists
00:14:05 when you are performing Phantom Horn,
00:14:08 like when you have become him?
00:14:10 Canonically, no,
00:14:11 canonically he lives in Ponyville.
00:14:13 Okay.
00:14:13 This, this, this, this, this flight of fancy is merely that.
00:14:17 All my other flights of fancy are canon.
00:14:19 See, your pony's thought a retarded
00:14:20 metapony thing like mine was.
00:14:22 It's a solid stuff.
00:14:24 That is what makes Peg and Fett
00:14:26 to the greatest OCS of all time.
00:14:27 Are only meta in that they canonically
00:14:29 live in Ponyville,
00:14:30 but also post to YouTube.
00:14:32 And review my little pony's reviews.
00:14:34 Yeah, yeah, they watch the show in world.
00:14:35 And like, yeah.
00:14:36 Strawberry milk lives in my house
00:14:38 and he doesn't pay rent,
00:14:39 even though he's Dragon Royalty
00:14:40 and he's just crashed out of my house
00:14:42 and they can rap day in, day out.
00:14:44 He won't fucking pay rent,
00:14:45 no matter how much they want to.
00:14:47 Yeah, sorry.
00:14:48 This is a terrible fucking off time.
00:14:50 Okay, well, all right,
00:14:52 the thing about that,
00:14:54 the thing about the Rowdy,
00:14:54 Munchy, I don't know if you agree with this,
00:14:56 but I'm just gonna speak for myself for a minute.
00:14:57 Of course.
00:14:58 I don't feel like the Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers
00:15:00 was stirring up real drama.
00:15:02 I don't.
00:15:02 Because let's just be fucking frank.
00:15:04 Nobody really gives a shit what FNGR
00:15:07 or Miss Anthropony or anyone else on that thing.
00:15:09 Yeah, give us a primer.
00:15:10 Give us a primer.
00:15:11 I don't think everybody who listens to this
00:15:13 is gonna know what the fuck
00:15:14 the Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers is.
00:15:15 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, god.
00:15:17 Okay, yeah, yeah.
00:15:18 What?
00:15:18 Like, basically,
00:15:20 Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers is like a,
00:15:21 I guess, a let's play show
00:15:22 that me and Ben have,
00:15:22 but it's so much more than that
00:15:24 in every single possible way.
00:15:26 It's evolved.
00:15:27 And when we start playing Frog Fractions,
00:15:31 the infamous Homestuck spinoff game,
00:15:35 we eventually just get so bored
00:15:37 and we are using like a screen sharing software.
00:15:40 So I just start tabbing over outside of the Flash game
00:15:42 and just start googling old pony reviewers
00:15:45 and we kind of spiral into just shit talking
00:15:47 everyone we know from that community
00:15:49 for like three hours.
00:15:51 I just started shit talking everyone
00:15:52 that I remembered from the old days
00:15:54 and like looking at OCs
00:15:55 and being like, oh, god, I hate this
00:15:57 and like talking about what was wrong
00:15:58 with the whole thing.
00:15:59 And it incurred,
00:16:00 it incurred some backlash from a couple of dudes.
00:16:02 I believe, I believe,
00:16:04 did you refer to as the most like,
00:16:06 something along the lines of like,
00:16:06 the most like haphazardly,
00:16:08 feminist thing he's ever seen?
00:16:11 I have a lot of venom.
00:16:12 I have a lot of venom on the subject.
00:16:13 It was a lot of piss and vinegar.
00:16:15 It was the most,
00:16:16 I don't remember the word I used,
00:16:17 but it's, it's a word that means
00:16:19 like you just didn't think about it.
00:16:21 Like that this was going to come out
00:16:22 and be public
00:16:23 and people were going to watch it.
00:16:25 Like.
00:16:25 No, but I know, I know, I know, I liked it.
00:16:27 We knew.
00:16:28 And that's, that's incredible to me.
00:16:30 The way I felt,
00:16:31 it was like, I'd been,
00:16:31 I'd been sitting on these feelings for so like,
00:16:33 I didn't want to come out with this
00:16:34 when like leaving the pony thing was fresh.
00:16:36 I didn't want to be the kind of guy
00:16:37 who like came out and shit on all like the people
00:16:39 I'd previously been associating with.
00:16:41 But now that this is like years in the past,
00:16:43 who gives a shit?
00:16:44 And I'm like, let me just talk.
00:16:45 I'd like to, I'd like to point out
00:16:47 that I am literally wearing my brony shirt
00:16:49 right now.
00:16:51 Very fucking moment.
00:16:52 All right.
00:16:53 But anyway, after that initial shit talking,
00:16:56 which we basically went on like the wiki
00:16:59 for all these people
00:17:00 and just went on each of their pages
00:17:01 and shit talk them for maybe like 30 minutes each
00:17:04 or you know, less beyond how relevant they are.
00:17:06 And we kind of dug into a couple of people
00:17:08 for like hours.
00:17:09 Dr. Will.
00:17:10 Which was great.
00:17:11 Yeah.
00:17:11 Which was very fun.
00:17:12 It was all, it was all good and fun.
00:17:14 And like, you know, it was pretty great.
00:17:17 Anyway, we get attacked by fucking, you know, assassins,
00:17:21 a top grade brony assassins named Miss Anthropony
00:17:25 for no good reason.
00:17:26 Coming at us with fucking, you know,
00:17:28 venom and fucking poison,
00:17:30 trying to, you know, ruin our day
00:17:31 and ran on our parade.
00:17:33 Before you go further,
00:17:33 we should probably point out
00:17:34 that for no good reason is a name,
00:17:36 even though Miss Anthropony basically did just
00:17:38 try and come at you for no good reason.
00:17:40 Yeah.
00:17:41 Right.
00:17:42 For no good reason is a person, sort of.
00:17:44 Yeah.
00:17:45 Nominally.
00:17:46 Strangely.
00:17:47 He's a changed,
00:17:48 maybe he was a human creature.
00:17:50 And then after that, we recorded,
00:17:53 we basically, what we did is,
00:17:55 we made a response video
00:17:56 to Miss Anthropony and FNGR's video.
00:17:59 And after that, which was also like five hours long,
00:18:02 then we made like a seven hour long video
00:18:04 where we invite FNGR on to watch,
00:18:07 for us to watch our response to his video,
00:18:11 of his video responding to us.
00:18:14 So basically it's a clusterfuck
00:18:16 and all you need to know is that
00:18:17 Bronies hate us now,
00:18:19 even though we're the saviors they deserve
00:18:20 and we're telling them everything we need to.
00:18:22 So, well the reason why I can feel this way
00:18:26 about drama and not see any conflict
00:18:29 with what we did on Rowdyfuckers' cop killers
00:18:33 is that this is not a real fight, you know?
00:18:36 Like this is not, like nobody,
00:18:38 at least nobody who's relevant to us
00:18:40 is, like nobody who's on board with the PCP
00:18:43 in any way is going to side with them.
00:18:45 Like this is, this is, this is mean,
00:18:48 like their opinions do not mean anything.
00:18:50 And it's just funny.
00:18:50 Miss Anthropony, in the comments of this video,
00:18:53 I think would argue otherwise.
00:18:54 Well, they know he will do.
00:18:56 I don't even have any particular ill will
00:18:58 towards Miss Anthropony,
00:18:59 even though I think that his arguments were pretty dumb.
00:19:02 But like, it's not a real fight,
00:19:05 like it's just funny and it's just like
00:19:07 a chance to like have like a good time
00:19:09 just shitting on some people, you know,
00:19:11 that I feel like deserve.
00:19:13 Even if Miss Anthropony, whatever,
00:19:14 like that seems to resolve.
00:19:15 And FNGR certainly seemed to have an attitude
00:19:17 of not sincere like investment in this like fight.
00:19:21 He seemed to, you know, so I don't know.
00:19:22 Well, I don't know what's that scoundrel.
00:19:25 I knew I was making people mad,
00:19:27 but I didn't, I feel, I felt like we were pretty safe
00:19:30 that this was not going to result
00:19:32 in any like meaningful schism
00:19:34 among like the people that are important to us.
00:19:36 I, and that's, that brings me to one of the things,
00:19:39 the things about drama.
00:19:41 Every time I get into drama, people are like,
00:19:44 why would you do that
00:19:46 when you're going to make some people so mad?
00:19:48 And it's because there's always going to be
00:19:50 just as many people who are like really glad somebody said it.
00:19:54 You know, like, if there's a problem,
00:19:57 then probably a lot of people have that problem, you know.
00:20:00 And when I call like,
00:20:01 when I did the shit talking anime YouTubers video,
00:20:03 which is like a very infamous drama sparking video I made,
00:20:07 30 minutes of me shit talking a bunch of anime YouTubers,
00:20:10 like it got, first of all,
00:20:12 it brought up conversation with all those guys.
00:20:14 I ended up talking to all those YouTubers, you know,
00:20:17 like coming to greater understandings.
00:20:19 Lots of people were like, yeah, I echo these sentiments
00:20:22 and you know, every, literally everyone I mentioned in the video
00:20:26 gained shitloads of subscribers and patrons.
00:20:29 Like it was because it just drew attention to people
00:20:32 and drew attention to things, you know, like anybody I praised,
00:20:35 people were like, oh, I got to see why he praised that guy.
00:20:37 Anybody insulted, they're like,
00:20:39 let me see if I agree with these insults, you know.
00:20:41 So like in the end,
00:20:42 and this is why drama is such a hot commodity on YouTube now,
00:20:46 which I, to clarify,
00:20:48 none of my drama videos have been for popularity's sake.
00:20:52 If I wanted that, I would go way harder on it.
00:20:54 But like, there's a good reason it works for that.
00:20:58 And it's because people want to be,
00:21:00 it's, it warps you into the conversation.
00:21:02 Like more and more people keep involving themselves in the drama
00:21:05 to bring attention to themselves.
00:21:07 And in ergo, the drama grows and becomes a bigger and bigger deal.
00:21:11 And therefore, more and more people want to pile on it.
00:21:13 And so it's just, it's just really beneficial for everybody involved.
00:21:17 But you know, it's, it's vapid content.
00:21:21 Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.
00:21:23 The thing here with Rafferty's Cop Killers
00:21:27 is that first of all, the original video is not a directed attack
00:21:32 at any one person,
00:21:33 but is instead us degrading a certain mindset and community as a whole.
00:21:39 Of course, we pick out certain people,
00:21:41 but those are only symptoms of the larger problem
00:21:43 that we have both faced individually within our lives.
00:21:46 So it's not directed, and it's not exactly the most, you know,
00:21:50 you know, like trained, you know,
00:21:52 calculated video as he stayed many times.
00:21:54 It's just, you know, us riffing.
00:21:56 And I think that kind of plays into the atmosphere.
00:21:58 Well, you know, you gotta play these things case by case.
00:22:01 It's not like, you know, not everything can be judged by the exact same merits.
00:22:04 And I think Rafferty's Cop Killers can easily,
00:22:06 well, you know, it could obviously be taken as wrong as it was by the people who we shit on.
00:22:11 A lot of people I don't think would even consider it a drama video per se.
00:22:14 It is just us talking as we always do.
00:22:16 I mean, you know, PZP shits on a lot of people all the time, 100% in fact.
00:22:22 So I don't think it's that far out, you know, out of left.
00:22:25 I just, like, the thing is, like, anyone who's on the side of the Brown Alice's community,
00:22:29 I think they're dumb.
00:22:30 And I don't want, I don't care if they're mad at me.
00:22:33 There shouldn't even, there shouldn't need to be a divide.
00:22:35 Like, Brody Analysis Community versus, like, Ben and Munchy.
00:22:39 Because, like, you specifically attack individuals,
00:22:42 which is, like, kind of the whole point of it.
00:22:44 Like, the individual people are shit.
00:22:46 To have that kind of group mentality, like, oh, we need to, like, look out for our own?
00:22:50 Yeah.
00:22:51 No, you don't.
00:22:51 No, you don't.
00:22:52 Lightning Bliss is an idiot.
00:22:54 And she makes terrible shit.
00:22:56 The weird group mentality is what we, like, is what, like,
00:22:58 I go, like, almost, or one of the hardest things that I hit on.
00:23:01 Yeah, yeah.
00:23:02 That's not, as being not a fan of.
00:23:04 And, yeah, the final, but the final chapter closed, we laid all our enemies to waste
00:23:10 in the final episode of the Frog Fraction Saga.
00:23:13 Rowdy fuckers, cop killers, nine, Frog Fractions, episode two,
00:23:16 Frog Fractions two, part three, Frog Finale.
00:23:18 RFCK9FFE2FF2P3FF.
00:23:21 Wait, is that out?
00:23:22 Is that the latest one?
00:23:22 That's the latest one.
00:23:24 I just wanted to make the title as long and as obnoxious an abbreviation.
00:23:29 We completely melted and dissolved their avatars.
00:23:31 And now we have, we have fucking add them to our stew,
00:23:34 and we have consumed their entire being.
00:23:36 We have consumed our entire consciousness.
00:23:38 And now we have gained complete and total control over both their Kundalini
00:23:43 and their Merkaba.
00:23:44 And now we can drive them as we see fit.
00:23:46 We took, we took their polygons and added them to our character models.
00:23:50 And now we're like, now we're HD.
00:23:52 Well, okay.
00:23:53 I want to talk about, like, why I think we can get away with,
00:23:56 with some of this stuff that we do, because like,
00:23:59 I think the PCP being such a strong foundation for all of us,
00:24:04 kind of allows us to like burn other bridges.
00:24:07 Like, there's a lot of people, I know content creators who will never say a mean thing
00:24:11 about another content creator, because they're just terrified of burning any bridge.
00:24:15 They're like, I want to be able to work with all these guys in the future.
00:24:18 And, and like, you know, I'll, there'll be people who I know everyone has a problem with
00:24:23 and I bring them up around people and they go, oh, yeah, you know,
00:24:25 he's a little, uh, you know, he's, he's him.
00:24:28 And I'm like, yeah, like, yeah, you're not going to say anything about it.
00:24:32 You know, like, no, I want to be able to work with them in the future.
00:24:35 I think with us, like, we, we know we've got these guys out though.
00:24:40 It's not a cop out.
00:24:41 It totally is to say that you want to work.
00:24:43 If you don't like them, of course, you don't want to work them.
00:24:45 You don't want to start any shit.
00:24:46 You don't want to be the guy that has the first stone.
00:24:48 Yeah.
00:24:48 And for me, it's like, I already know I've got the PCP, you know,
00:24:53 at the very least, I've got this group of friends
00:24:55 and, and business associates that I don't have any problems with
00:24:59 who I can work with, you know.
00:25:01 And, and so everybody else is like, uh, like, look,
00:25:05 I don't need to have a thousand friends.
00:25:07 I don't need to have a thousand connections.
00:25:09 You know, I'm really, if insulting this guy means like
00:25:12 his entire fan base hates me from now on, cool.
00:25:16 I'll be over here with this other fan base who also hates that guy.
00:25:20 You know, I think, I think an important distinction here to be made
00:25:24 is that like in the, like in the, uh, you know, fucking definition,
00:25:28 drama is about like nothing.
00:25:30 Like, like the kind of drama that everyone, you know, hates
00:25:32 and, you know, dislikes makes fun of,
00:25:34 is kind of drama that is about nothing.
00:25:37 When you have like legitimate problems with people,
00:25:40 obviously it can still be considered drama,
00:25:41 but it's more pointed and, you know, constructive and important
00:25:45 and actually, you know, worth having around as a species,
00:25:48 as opposed to just someone disliking someone for,
00:25:51 you know, miscellaneous reasons
00:25:53 and just bringing up like, like just kind of waiting for them to do,
00:25:56 you know, like the PewDiePie thing.
00:25:57 He didn't do anything wrong.
00:25:59 You people just wanted to, you know, take him down a peg
00:26:01 or I guess in the conspiracy theory just destroy what you do.
00:26:04 You could argue that what PewDiePie said is not cool for whatever reason,
00:26:08 but like, I know that's not why they went so hard about it.
00:26:10 Exactly, exactly.
00:26:11 So I'm trying to say.
00:26:12 What about, what about, would you call,
00:26:13 would you call what like the things happening right now
00:26:15 with guys like like Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey that's like,
00:26:18 you know, like molestation allegations and whatnot, sexual harassment.
00:26:22 Is that drama or is that like something else?
00:26:24 That's like a legal issue.
00:26:25 You know, I think it's, it's like a lawsuit, which is not.
00:26:28 Yeah, but I think it's both because I think that what those guys have done,
00:26:33 yeah, that's obviously a legal issue and like it deserves to be brought,
00:26:36 like brought to light probably, but the motivations for bringing it to light
00:26:40 are by the way, by the way.
00:26:42 Here's the problem with that whole thing.
00:26:44 There's, there's two sides to it.
00:26:45 There's the legal issues, which is like, hey, you diddle the dude,
00:26:49 that's bad, probably shouldn't do that.
00:26:51 That's, that's not good.
00:26:52 We can all agree on that.
00:26:53 There's, there's also the people like who hop on the bandwagon like,
00:26:57 yeah, it happened to me too, by somebody, somewhere, sometime,
00:27:02 please pay attention to me.
00:27:03 I want to keep this fire burning.
00:27:05 And it's like, you're not sure if you cared about the actual legal issues,
00:27:08 you would, you would actually constructively solve the problem,
00:27:11 but you don't, you just want to keep the fire burning.
00:27:14 Cause again, like they're very, they started as an observer.
00:27:17 They feel empathetic towards the cause, but they don't,
00:27:20 again, they don't want to cast that stone.
00:27:22 So they're going to, they're going to take that half step of like,
00:27:25 I'm going to make this a bigger problem,
00:27:26 but I'm not going to actually incriminate myself in any way
00:27:29 or actively get involved.
00:27:30 That's like, that's like people, people taking like,
00:27:32 like monkey talked about, like taking the Elliot Rogers thing
00:27:36 and like, like taking, taking something else that happened
00:27:38 and using it as like a platform for their, for their agenda.
00:27:42 Right. Yeah. Good point.
00:27:43 That's what a lot of people are doing with this whole sexual
00:27:46 drama thing right now.
00:27:47 And that's when you, when you do that.
00:27:49 Yeah. When you do it that way, that's drama.
00:27:50 By the way, I'd like to come out real quick
00:27:52 and castigate the guy who came forward with the allegations
00:27:56 against Kevin Spacey.
00:27:57 Why the fuck didn't you wait till season six
00:27:59 of house of cards was done?
00:28:00 You piece of shit.
00:28:00 You're literally fucking me right now.
00:28:02 You're fucking me right now.
00:28:04 This is rape.
00:28:04 This is fucking rape. Congratulations.
00:28:06 You are the monster that you claim to fight against.
00:28:10 When I heard those, the allegations I heard
00:28:12 were that he like flirted with him.
00:28:15 Like, did he even actually do anything to him?
00:28:18 I have no idea.
00:28:20 I have no idea what the situation is.
00:28:22 If you can even look at somebody the wrong way,
00:28:24 it's rape now.
00:28:25 Okay. Okay.
00:28:26 Let me spell it out.
00:28:27 There's, let's keep this light, guys.
00:28:30 The first allegation against Kevin Spacey was just that
00:28:32 like he basically tried to have sex with a 14-year-old,
00:28:35 not like super aggressively, but somewhat,
00:28:37 which is like fucked up and you know, pretty weird.
00:28:39 Sure.
00:28:39 But Kevin was such a fucking beta.
00:28:41 He couldn't even get with a 14-year-old.
00:28:43 He easily overpowered, but he fucking said it.
00:28:45 And this was over 30 years ago.
00:28:48 So like that one's a little bit shaky.
00:28:49 Who knows?
00:28:49 Okay, but like the new ones are like people working on the set with him
00:28:52 on House of Cards, like since the beginning of the show,
00:28:54 are saying like, oh, he's like groped guys
00:28:56 and made inappropriate comments,
00:28:57 which all sound very nebulous.
00:28:59 And I don't like, what's your actual core testimony for this?
00:29:01 I mean, as Stereo's Kokano said,
00:29:02 that he's been hearing rumors about this for like 15 years or something.
00:29:06 So I'm willing to believe.
00:29:07 Okay.
00:29:08 As someone tweeted,
00:29:10 someone tweeted that like family guy made a joke
00:29:12 about Kevin Spacey having like sex slaves in his basement,
00:29:15 which like I feel like maybe might have like colored the waters for something.
00:29:19 Like maybe some people heard that and internalized it.
00:29:21 Or maybe that was based on true.
00:29:24 Yeah, I don't know.
00:29:25 I don't know.
00:29:26 Okay.
00:29:26 On one of the episodes that we had Stereo's on,
00:29:30 on the insufferable social media argument,
00:29:31 he was talking about,
00:29:33 or maybe this was on the dick show.
00:29:34 I don't remember.
00:29:34 All my fucking Asterios is bleeding into each other.
00:29:36 But he was talking about how in the industry.
00:29:38 The Asterios diaspora.
00:29:40 When something like this happens, there's,
00:29:42 no, it was on the dick show.
00:29:43 He was talking about the heart, the Weinstein thing,
00:29:46 and how like everyone had known this.
00:29:49 Like this was just something that everybody knew in Hollywood.
00:29:52 And he was like, every time one of these things comes out,
00:29:55 that is always the case.
00:29:56 Like everybody knows there just nobody's going to say anything
00:29:59 until that person's like number is up.
00:30:02 You know, it's just waiting for the pin to drop.
00:30:05 When someone decides that you're next,
00:30:08 that's when they come for you.
00:30:09 You know, and there's no real,
00:30:12 I mean, to me, it's like, it's never surprising
00:30:16 because it's like you've got to be,
00:30:17 you kind of have to be mentally damaged
00:30:19 in some way to work in entertainment.
00:30:21 You know, like why the fuck else would you be here?
00:30:24 None of us is sane, I don't think.
00:30:27 Probably any of us qualifies as sane.
00:30:30 Yeah, I know what you mean.
00:30:31 I do my best.
00:30:32 I'm cultured.
00:30:33 I'm a philosopher.
00:30:35 Well, okay, let me.
00:30:36 So, okay, this is all interesting stuff,
00:30:38 but let me just, so all of you guys,
00:30:39 to some degree or another,
00:30:41 have involved yourself with some drama-ish situation.
00:30:44 Including Tom.
00:30:45 Hashtag leaving the fandom.
00:30:47 Hashtag burning breakfast, you know.
00:30:49 See, it's interesting to say that
00:30:51 because I was going to bring up-
00:30:52 This is a really pony-charged episode today,
00:30:54 I didn't expect that.
00:30:55 We all had a lot of pony trauma.
00:30:57 Well, it's true, it's true.
00:30:58 It's because that was my one exception,
00:31:01 but for the most part, I think I probably,
00:31:04 in general, I'm the least drama person here,
00:31:06 question mark, maybe.
00:31:08 I have something to say relevant to that.
00:31:11 Oh, well, I didn't mean to interrupt,
00:31:12 but if I have the floor, I just want to say that-
00:31:14 Well, it's too late now, isn't it, Ben?
00:31:17 The reason why I felt comfortable making that
00:31:20 Dungeons & Dragons Attack video, responding to it,
00:31:23 and the reason why I jumped on that so quickly,
00:31:25 is because I knew that I could make a counter-argument
00:31:31 to yours, and make it into a thing,
00:31:33 and joke that, like, ah, fuck Tom,
00:31:34 and I knew that it wouldn't escalate into a real-
00:31:36 Yeah, that was hilarious, I loved that.
00:31:38 I figured that you would appreciate it,
00:31:40 and I thought it was fun, and I was, you know,
00:31:43 glad I saw an opportunity to be like,
00:31:45 yeah, let's make a little thing out of this.
00:31:47 Everybody got the joke.
00:31:48 That's like anti-drama, almost.
00:31:50 I mean, it's faux drama, I guess,
00:31:52 and yeah, I think everybody appreciated it,
00:31:54 but the reason-
00:31:55 I, yeah.
00:31:55 Sorry, yeah, finish your point if you're-
00:31:56 I was just gonna say it was great,
00:31:58 and we should, I hope more of that.
00:32:01 We should do more of that here on the PCP.
00:32:04 I already do more of that.
00:32:05 Well, that's something I was gonna bring up, is that-
00:32:06 But only when there's an issue that I actually-
00:32:08 Oh, wait, we should make a Patreon goal
00:32:10 for the procrastinators.
00:32:11 We will start PCP inter-PCP drama with each other.
00:32:14 We will create an issue for you to love
00:32:16 and latch onto a side, what were you saying, Tom?
00:32:18 We'll just manufacture it.
00:32:19 Well, I was gonna say, I was saying,
00:32:22 I tend to try and avoid drama for the most part,
00:32:26 and when people latch onto stuff,
00:32:28 I tend to not jump into it,
00:32:30 because even now, I still, I don't know,
00:32:33 I just kind of, even if there's something I want to say,
00:32:36 I don't, and I think that's a problem.
00:32:37 I think that makes my internet personality too boring.
00:32:40 I think I need to start shitting on people.
00:32:42 I think that would do good things for my career.
00:32:44 I feel like-
00:32:45 I have the same fear that I'm not contentious enough.
00:32:48 I just feel like I'm not that interesting.
00:32:50 I feel like because I don't jump into conflicts head-on,
00:32:53 that it's actually actively damaging my prospects going forward.
00:32:56 Better, better to, what's the saying?
00:32:57 Better to be hated than not to be discussed at all,
00:33:00 or something like that, you know?
00:33:01 All right, it feels relevant online.
00:33:03 I used to say and think a lot,
00:33:05 that like what I would really enjoy
00:33:08 is if the PCP did get into some drama,
00:33:10 not like inter-PCP drama,
00:33:12 but like if maybe some other podcast,
00:33:14 or other show, or other group of creators.
00:33:16 We need to pick a fight with somebody.
00:33:18 Yeah, with maybe like a similar clout to our own,
00:33:20 like if maybe there's like some genuine,
00:33:22 and some genuine-
00:33:25 Wait, what did you say?
00:33:27 Art retrieval.
00:33:28 Yeah, I'll pop up the entire thing
00:33:31 so they have no real threat against us,
00:33:34 but we can still attack them mercilessly.
00:33:36 I don't know.
00:33:37 It's controlled drama.
00:33:38 I wouldn't mind if we had like some genuine,
00:33:41 non-manufactured beef with some other group of people
00:33:44 that maybe have like similar,
00:33:45 or like slightly greater clout to us.
00:33:47 The pony book cast.
00:33:48 And it would be like a fair fight,
00:33:50 and like we would trade blows,
00:33:51 and people would take sides,
00:33:52 and like people like that kind of thing,
00:33:54 and it could be fun.
00:33:55 Like that's the kind of thing,
00:33:56 like remember back in the pony days,
00:33:57 sorry to bring it back to pony,
00:33:58 but remember back in the pony days
00:34:00 when we all saw it as like we're all in Bakuman,
00:34:02 and we're all the fucking,
00:34:03 we're all like competing with each other, right?
00:34:05 It's like a hot-blooded rivalry.
00:34:06 I don't know, I missed that a little bit.
00:34:09 That sense of needing to best of it.
00:34:11 It drives creation and enthusiasm.
00:34:16 That's true, but the smart business decision for us to be
00:34:18 would be to manufacture drama with a much larger podcast,
00:34:22 like the fucking sleepy cast.
00:34:23 That's true.
00:34:24 We could somehow make drama happen with them,
00:34:25 like that would be the best way
00:34:27 to like suddenly boost our relevancy
00:34:28 if we could do that or something.
00:34:30 Dick Vaster said that he used to constantly like shit-talk
00:34:33 Mark Maron on Biggest Problem and the Dick Show,
00:34:36 like trying to make that happen.
00:34:38 For no reason, just bringing up Mark Maron and being like,
00:34:41 yeah fuck that guy, like just hoping that it wouldn't...
00:34:44 Who is that guy again?
00:34:45 Mark Maron's like the biggest podcaster in the world.
00:34:49 He's the one who interviewed Obama that time.
00:34:51 Well then why haven't I heard of him?
00:34:52 If he's so great.
00:34:53 He had a fucking show on Netflix, Maron.
00:34:56 I never heard of Netflix.
00:34:58 When is the PCP Netflix show going to come out?
00:35:00 Thanks for spoiling Biggest Problem.
00:35:02 And when is there going to be male on male rope
00:35:04 on that one, huh, Kevin?
00:35:06 It's not much of a spoiler,
00:35:07 because they never managed to get Mark Maron to fight.
00:35:10 God damn it.
00:35:11 You spoiled that part for me too.
00:35:13 Here guys, okay.
00:35:14 The reason I brought up this drama, Tom's drama,
00:35:18 I'm just interested to hear everyone's individual story,
00:35:20 but the reason I bring it up is because
00:35:21 I want to point out how I am literally perfect.
00:35:24 I am an evolved being.
00:35:25 I am superior to all of you,
00:35:27 because I have never, ever been involved in drama.
00:35:29 You're starting some drama right now.
00:35:32 Well Nate, I think the thing about with you not having drama,
00:35:36 you very much have tried to be like a,
00:35:39 in spite of the fact that you're in the PCP,
00:35:41 your YouTube presence has always been very independent.
00:35:43 And like you do not associate as part of a community.
00:35:46 You do not really like,
00:35:48 when other people ask you about YouTubers,
00:35:50 it's always either like I watch them or I don't.
00:35:53 It's never like here's what I think they do
00:35:56 to my content or like what they do to the atmosphere of YouTube.
00:35:59 Like you don't really care about that kind of shit.
00:36:00 You're just like, I'm over here in my own world doing my videos,
00:36:04 you know, which is a healthy way to even how
00:36:06 most YouTubers probably are.
00:36:08 Nate, Nate can get away with that
00:36:09 because he has such a natural charisma by default,
00:36:13 where I don't.
00:36:14 So I need something to make me interesting
00:36:15 because right now I'm just a boring piece of shit.
00:36:17 I need to start shit with somebody.
00:36:19 I also think, Nate, that you would have more drama
00:36:22 if it weren't for the fact that you tend to play things off
00:36:24 in a very playful, like you shit talk people,
00:36:27 it just never starts anything.
00:36:29 Like you will blatantly like just shit on somebody,
00:36:32 but because you do it with such a like,
00:36:34 like a smiley, laughy gravitas to it,
00:36:37 like nobody really cares.
00:36:39 Like nobody takes it personally.
00:36:40 They're just like, oh yeah, well whatever.
00:36:42 You know, like when I do it, it's like,
00:36:44 I get drunk and like tear someone's whole life apart.
00:36:46 And like, yeah, yeah.
00:36:48 It's a different atmosphere behind those sorts of things, you know.
00:36:51 You can tell there's anger when I start drama.
00:36:55 Yeah, yeah, it's true.
00:36:56 I have, I don't, I try not to shit talk people.
00:37:00 And I think it's because that if I did,
00:37:02 it would come off as very like serious and grave.
00:37:05 And like, I don't know.
00:37:06 I can't, I can't.
00:37:07 I don't shit talk anyone, says Ben St.
00:37:09 with 15 hours of rowdy fuckers cop killers.
00:37:11 Well, they don't care.
00:37:12 Well, they don't care.
00:37:13 Well, Tom, Tom, what the fuck is with you
00:37:16 and all the boring thing?
00:37:17 I'm like, oh, Ben is so mean.
00:37:19 Ben, Ben did all of this.
00:37:21 No, I was there too.
00:37:23 I'm a mean, I'm a bully too.
00:37:25 Hashtag, what about Munchy?
00:37:28 Hashtag, what about Munchy?
00:37:29 I'm only responding because Ben was talking.
00:37:31 Munchy, you are just as much of a dick.
00:37:33 Thank you, Munchy.
00:37:35 Finally.
00:37:36 Munchy in many ways has the same thing as Nate,
00:37:38 where Munchy's a big memer.
00:37:40 So like, people aren't,
00:37:41 like both of you guys are constantly spouting memes.
00:37:43 So like, when you guys shit on somebody,
00:37:46 it's like seen as more of a meme, you know.
00:37:50 If Ben, who's, Ben is more of like a,
00:37:53 I don't know, Ben is a very like funny, lighthearted guy,
00:37:56 but he's got a little bit more of like a heady persona,
00:37:59 where like, if he insults somebody, it's like,
00:38:01 well fuck, if Ben thinks it, it must be serious, you know.
00:38:05 Oh, I think Ben just has like that,
00:38:07 he kind of comes off as a judgmental person
00:38:10 in general sometimes.
00:38:11 Oh, Ben is a very judgmental person.
00:38:13 Jesus.
00:38:14 So when he does it, you know, it's like,
00:38:17 I know who this Ben St. character is.
00:38:19 This isn't for chuckles, this is for real.
00:38:23 You know what it is, I can be really judgmental sometimes,
00:38:26 and I don't really like that about myself.
00:38:28 So I think that I like avoid, not with the pony stuff,
00:38:30 but with most things, I try to avoid,
00:38:33 I try to avoid coming out and like making statements
00:38:36 like against people because I know that like,
00:38:39 I don't want to let that out into the public sphere
00:38:42 because I don't like it, you know.
00:38:43 I also like to,
00:38:44 I know that no one's going to appreciate it.
00:38:46 Wait, hold on, Ben, correct me if I'm wrong here,
00:38:48 but I feel like you and I and Nate are different in this way.
00:38:52 I think Nate, when he doesn't like somebody,
00:38:55 doesn't think about him.
00:38:56 Like, when somebody brings up a name that like,
00:39:00 Nate's like, oh, that guy sucks, you know,
00:39:02 like it's because Nate like watched one of his videos,
00:39:03 thought he sucked in that moment and then forgot,
00:39:05 and then he hasn't stewed on it.
00:39:07 With you and me, Ben, we stew on the people we don't like.
00:39:09 Yeah, I definitely do that to an extremely large extent.
00:39:13 We sit around, I know we have sat around and like,
00:39:17 like we all sit around and just shit on people all day.
00:39:20 Like if there's someone we're both stewing on,
00:39:22 you know, it becomes a little bit of a circus.
00:39:25 You know, I try, I try to like keep that down
00:39:29 and not stew, but like when it comes up,
00:39:32 I can't help myself.
00:39:33 Sam, you know, I'm naturally inclined to stew
00:39:37 and to be like, yeah, fucking,
00:39:40 here's what I think about this shit and it makes me mad.
00:39:43 This does kind of, I mean, it sort of is explained by
00:39:47 our sort of different approaches to life, I guess,
00:39:49 because I really am, and here comes your dose
00:39:51 of hashtag weird utilitarianism.
00:39:53 All right, well, I expected that to be your whole place
00:39:56 in this one.
00:39:57 That's where I've been trying to steer
00:39:59 this lumbering massive ship this whole time,
00:40:01 and we're moving in that direction now.
00:40:02 It's like, I'm always, like,
00:40:04 I'm totally pragmatic about this.
00:40:06 Like what good is done by me dwelling on people I don't care?
00:40:08 Like just yesterday, I was telling you guys
00:40:10 about a YouTuber, I have decided now
00:40:13 I do not care about anymore,
00:40:14 and I'm not going to think about them anymore,
00:40:16 and it's been great, and I have not.
00:40:17 They broke the bridge and I'm done with them.
00:40:19 Yeah, like I'm not gonna say, I don't hate the person at all,
00:40:23 but I appreciate that.
00:40:25 I appreciate that.
00:40:26 A while, I don't know.
00:40:26 And like, I've tried to do that.
00:40:27 Here, I'll type it.
00:40:28 I'll type it.
00:40:29 I've tried to do that with like, I don't know,
00:40:30 with like, I don't know, people with political opinions
00:40:34 or social opinions, like the whole Sargon
00:40:37 and everyone like him that makes me so fucking mad
00:40:40 to think about, like I just decided,
00:40:42 like okay, all I want to do is destroy these people
00:40:45 and make them not exist, but I can't.
00:40:47 So the best thing to do, all I can do,
00:40:50 all I can do is not watch their content
00:40:51 and not think about them.
00:40:52 That's the only thing at my disposal.
00:40:55 So yes, when possible, that is my weapon of choice.
00:40:59 I wish I had the mindset that you have, Nate,
00:41:01 because for me, people can become like a meme in my mind.
00:41:07 Oh, I'm fully on your side.
00:41:09 Munchy me and you, I know you're like this,
00:41:12 because we need to do this thing where the more we bitch
00:41:15 about somebody or the more we think about them,
00:41:17 the funnier it gets.
00:41:18 Oh my god, exactly, exactly.
00:41:21 It's kind of like with Sword Art Online,
00:41:22 how like that show, just watching it's a bad show,
00:41:25 but the more me and Victor made fun of it
00:41:27 and talked about it, the funnier it got to me.
00:41:29 And so like, it got to a point where now I've got like,
00:41:32 fucking posters and toys of Sword Art Online
00:41:34 because I just want to make fun of it.
00:41:35 And like, it brings me joy to see it.
00:41:38 And like, I get that way.
00:41:40 And I don't want to start any drama by saying this,
00:41:44 but it's exactly what Mother's Basement is for me in my life.
00:41:49 It's someone who I've made fun of and talked shit about so much
00:41:54 and it keeps getting funnier.
00:41:55 And especially because like, people, for some reason,
00:41:58 this is not provocated by me, I don't know how this happened,
00:42:02 other than that, we're sort of around the same sub count,
00:42:05 the same like kind of around popularity as YouTubers.
00:42:09 But when people decide they don't like him, they tell me.
00:42:14 Like people, I like very frequently get messages
00:42:18 about people being like, oh, I'm real sick of Mother's Basement.
00:42:21 I'm glad you're still doing this kind of videos you're doing.
00:42:24 Like, it happens all the time.
00:42:26 Do you want to accept this like frightening?
00:42:27 And I want to be like, like, you know,
00:42:29 I got to talk to these people and be like, yeah, I see that.
00:42:31 Like, I see why, you know?
00:42:32 And so like, somehow when I created my discord,
00:42:36 like the first thing that happened was like,
00:42:38 it became a huge meme to shit on Jeff.
00:42:40 And I was like, wait, hold on.
00:42:42 This is starting to get out of hand.
00:42:44 Like, let's snip this.
00:42:46 And then Troll started coming in who like recognized this
00:42:49 and tried to start a war between our discords,
00:42:51 which thankfully didn't work because they were fucking retarded.
00:42:54 But like, you know, and I still,
00:42:56 I'll still work with Jeff on some things.
00:42:59 You know, I don't hate the guy,
00:43:00 but like it became so funny to make fun of him
00:43:04 that now he has a big meme.
00:43:06 When you start drama with someone and like,
00:43:08 and you focus on them so much, like, like,
00:43:10 initially there's no, there's no like funny parts there,
00:43:13 at least most of the time.
00:43:14 It's just like, man, I fucking hate this guy.
00:43:15 But the more you dwell on him and like,
00:43:16 talk to other people with it, especially,
00:43:18 you sort of get this like,
00:43:18 character in your brain of like,
00:43:21 like you pick out all the words parts of it
00:43:22 and then you just create this horrible monstrosity
00:43:25 of all the worst possible aspects of that person.
00:43:27 And just watch them dance around in your brain.
00:43:30 I won't say who, I won't say who in this call,
00:43:34 I did that with, with Jeff,
00:43:35 that turned him into a meme in my mind.
00:43:37 But what if he was partially responsible for that?
00:43:41 That, that, that isn't,
00:43:42 Jeff is an example of where I have taken
00:43:44 the opposite of approach,
00:43:45 because thinking about Jeff feels,
00:43:47 feels bad to me.
00:43:48 Thinking about, thinking about someone like Jeff,
00:43:51 thinking about someone like Jeff,
00:43:52 turning out, turning out content
00:43:53 that is like designed for SEO optimization and stuff,
00:43:57 like turning it out mechanically and like,
00:43:59 get like, wheeling and dealing and like,
00:44:01 getting industry connections due to this fucking,
00:44:04 this whatever it is and people,
00:44:06 but more so than that,
00:44:07 more so than him doing it,
00:44:07 the thought of people buying into it,
00:44:09 this goes the same for like someone like Dr. Wolfe
00:44:12 on like a larger scale,
00:44:12 the idea of someone doing that and people buying into it
00:44:15 upsets me and makes me mad.
00:44:16 And so like, while it is kind of funny sometimes,
00:44:19 ultimately the laughter dies and I just sit there stupid.
00:44:23 In my impotent, impotent rage and the best thing to do
00:44:28 is just stop thinking about it.
00:44:29 As funny as the meme, as funny as it is
00:44:32 to make fun of Jeff,
00:44:33 I do eventually enter that state where I'm like,
00:44:35 well, I can, I can laugh at this all I want,
00:44:38 but that motherfucker's laugh into the bank.
00:44:40 You know, that guy's making way more money
00:44:44 than me at the end of the day.
00:44:46 And no matter how many of his fans leave him
00:44:49 to come bitch to me about him,
00:44:51 he'll always have more fans coming in.
00:44:53 It's just about what kind of,
00:44:54 what do you want your life to be like?
00:44:56 You know, whatever.
00:44:57 Jeff can do whatever he wants.
00:44:58 I guess I should focus more on the drama itself.
00:45:00 Yeah, I don't know.
00:45:02 Tom, you were saying something.
00:45:03 I just take everything to like the worst degree possible
00:45:06 with this because I have the same issue where I don't,
00:45:09 the only people that bother me are people
00:45:11 who are shittier than me and make more money
00:45:13 or have more respect because fuck that.
00:45:15 Or people that are a different race.
00:45:17 That's how I feel.
00:45:18 That's a big issue for me too.
00:45:18 That's how I feel about every single one of you.
00:45:22 There's like the Nate method where there's like one stage
00:45:26 or just like fuck it.
00:45:27 I don't care anymore.
00:45:28 And by the way, I want to point out that that stage,
00:45:30 this is not like a lighthearted thing.
00:45:32 This is a cold calculated.
00:45:33 This is the optimal way to destroy these people.
00:45:36 I would expect nothing less than you, Nate.
00:45:37 Of course it was.
00:45:38 Yes, good.
00:45:39 I come off lighthearted, but I want to destroy people.
00:45:41 I have that seething desire.
00:45:43 Okay, go on.
00:45:44 Then there's the Ben.
00:45:46 Just kidding, I'm fun.
00:45:48 Hey guys, send me messages.
00:45:53 There's the Ben and Digi approach
00:45:55 where you try not to care, but you can't.
00:45:58 And then it gets funny and then it becomes bad.
00:46:00 For me, it's like I try not to care.
00:46:02 Then I get mad.
00:46:03 And then I'm just like, well, the problem is me.
00:46:05 I should be doing better.
00:46:07 And then I just get mad at myself.
00:46:08 And that's what I do.
00:46:09 Oh, right, all right.
00:46:10 That's tough.
00:46:10 That's tough.
00:46:11 I have the skills.
00:46:12 There's no reason why this shouldn't be working.
00:46:14 And then I just hate myself.
00:46:16 And that's the worst.
00:46:17 I have an element to that with the Jeff thing,
00:46:19 where sometimes I'm like,
00:46:21 but why am I not doing what he's doing?
00:46:23 Like, that man is going to surpass me.
00:46:28 And for most people, they won't be able to tell the difference.
00:46:31 Like, I can sit here and say like, oh, I make real content.
00:46:35 He doesn't, not so much so that it's a huge difference.
00:46:39 That only matters to you, right?
00:46:41 Yeah, me and my fans, yeah.
00:46:44 But like, to the average Joe.
00:46:45 To the public at large, the numbers.
00:46:47 It's like that fucking goodwill hunting thing
00:46:50 about how Will is like the super genius,
00:46:52 but he's so good at math and shit.
00:46:54 The only people who even recognize he's that good
00:46:56 are like fellow genius math people who just aren't white.
00:46:59 And I'm not trying to suck your dick here.
00:47:00 You're fucking pathetic.
00:47:01 You're a piece of shit.
00:47:02 I hate you.
00:47:03 But I am the one I'm talking about in this situation.
00:47:05 He smiles.
00:47:07 Terry, did you laugh a lot?
00:47:08 That's the genius, the, what's it called?
00:47:11 Like the genius paradox or some shit like that?
00:47:14 Basically, you can understand people who are like either
00:47:18 like 30 points below or 30 points above you in IQ.
00:47:21 And anything beyond that, like if it's less than,
00:47:24 or if it's more than 30 points less,
00:47:25 then they just seem like a fucking retard.
00:47:27 And if it's more than 30 points more,
00:47:29 they seem like a fucking god
00:47:31 and you can't understand what's coming out of their mouth.
00:47:33 Like that episode of a regular show.
00:47:36 Right from his cop killers.
00:47:41 It's just too big.
00:47:43 We're 7,000 IQ points above the pronounces community
00:47:46 and they call me a neighboring retard.
00:47:49 They say that like the best play,
00:47:51 if you want to be like a businessman,
00:47:52 the best place to be is in like the 100 to 110 range of IQ.
00:47:58 Because you can, you can, you can sell stuff to idiots.
00:48:01 You can sell stuff to normies.
00:48:02 You can sell stuff to people who are kind of smart.
00:48:04 And you don't got to worry about the extremes.
00:48:05 I think everybody in the PCP sits around
00:48:09 anywhere from like 125 to 145, you know?
00:48:14 Like we're all in this upper level.
00:48:15 And like, so when we get down,
00:48:17 when we get down to the people who are like IQ 80,
00:48:19 like Ms. Anthropony.
00:48:25 Damn.
00:48:25 It's like you just, you can't, you can't.
00:48:27 Start drama again right here.
00:48:28 Do you, do you think Ms. Anthropony has an IQ above 100?
00:48:31 Ms. Anthropony, I have no problem with you.
00:48:33 You tried your best out there buddy.
00:48:35 I don't know enough about IQ to make statements like that.
00:48:38 Oh, it doesn't make you a better or worse person to be stupid.
00:48:42 It just makes it so people like me
00:48:43 can't positively fathom how you think.
00:48:45 I'm glad, I'm glad according to Digi,
00:48:46 we all have excuses now for why we love Morgan Morty so much.
00:48:50 I won't make any sweeping statements about the man,
00:48:52 but his arguments in the videos directed at me
00:48:54 did not give the impression of overwhelming intelligence.
00:48:58 I've seen Digi's content since back in the pony days,
00:49:01 when he made videos, by the way,
00:49:02 shitting on all of us, and yet is somehow like the biggest fan.
00:49:06 I'd like to point out for the record that,
00:49:08 as far as I know, mine is the only one that's still up,
00:49:11 even though it was-
00:49:11 Oh, is that true?
00:49:12 Oh, really?
00:49:13 Wait, you won.
00:49:14 His attack video by Ms. Anthropony?
00:49:16 Yeah, he deleted all the other ones,
00:49:17 but he made mine and then put the apology
00:49:19 at the end of mine and kept it up.
00:49:21 What?
00:49:22 Yeah.
00:49:22 Great, great.
00:49:23 Which I always found was kind of funny.
00:49:25 That is very amusing.
00:49:25 So that's the most I'm going to get into that drama is that.
00:49:27 That was kind of weird.
00:49:28 No offense to you Ms. Anthropony, you might be fine,
00:49:31 but I'm just saying, you might not be the most intelligent person.
00:49:36 And that's fine.
00:49:37 The statement that did you, bro, do not reflect the-
00:49:39 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:49:42 I think there's some intent,
00:49:44 offense going to come through there.
00:49:45 Is Ms. Anthropony a patron?
00:49:46 Should I be?
00:49:47 Hey, we're just breaking ball.
00:49:48 Oh, he should be getting it out of this.
00:49:50 I don't know.
00:49:50 We're just breaking ball.
00:49:51 No, no, no editing, no filter, nothing.
00:49:54 Yeah, this is all good.
00:49:55 This is all going on.
00:49:56 In fact, it's going to be echoed so they hear it twice.
00:50:01 Now I feel bad because Ms. Anthropony
00:50:02 like comments on this channel and like really likes the show.
00:50:06 Yeah, he does.
00:50:08 Look, we're just joking around here.
00:50:09 Right guys, right?
00:50:10 He's the one who shits on you all the time.
00:50:12 Like, he did, he did.
00:50:14 He did, but it didn't make me feel bad
00:50:16 because it just bounced off
00:50:18 because it didn't mean anything to me.
00:50:19 Because it seemed to make Jackie pretty mad.
00:50:22 She was pretty fucking pissed.
00:50:23 She did, she got pretty mad.
00:50:25 I'm not going to specify, I'm going to keep it vague here,
00:50:29 but why was that Benz just a week ago?
00:50:31 It was the most euphoric time
00:50:33 because every time we got on the car
00:50:34 we just hot boxed insults about like the various people
00:50:37 within our lives.
00:50:38 And it was just like a drama hot box
00:50:40 where we were just high on vapes and anger.
00:50:42 And we just fucking, we just rode to Valhalla.
00:50:44 It sounds like a normal day in the St. household.
00:50:47 Yeah, that's true.
00:50:48 Yeah, pretty much.
00:50:49 It was very cathartic though.
00:50:50 Did they get you to vape?
00:50:50 Did they convince you to vape?
00:50:52 No, no.
00:50:52 Please say no.
00:50:53 Please don't let that disgusting substance
00:50:55 touch your lips, Mudgey.
00:50:56 Thank you, thank you.
00:50:58 My horse, my horse, my voice got so hoarse
00:51:01 and like my voice wouldn't work
00:51:03 because I just inhaled so much secondhand vape
00:51:05 that my voice just got so fucking high
00:51:07 I couldn't speak anymore.
00:51:09 It was really, it was, it was really awful.
00:51:12 Like, like, like after like an entire day
00:51:14 I just was like, hey, I can't, Ben,
00:51:16 I need some pizza, please.
00:51:18 I just couldn't fucking, I just couldn't speak anymore.
00:51:20 I actually believe that's possible in a car
00:51:22 with Ben and Jackie because they vape way harder
00:51:25 than normal people vape.
00:51:26 Yeah.
00:51:27 Like when Jackie, when Jackie pulls a vape,
00:51:29 there's a fucking clown after they have fucking vape.
00:51:32 Yeah, there's a haze, there's a haze in the house.
00:51:34 I was surrounded by vape, I was surrounded by fog
00:51:36 the entire time I was at Ben's house.
00:51:38 The fucking neighborhood children
00:51:39 gather outside the St. House windows
00:51:41 to inhale that sweet cloud coming out of the practical wall.
00:51:44 Jackie hits the vape like, like asthmatics hit a,
00:51:48 like a truck hitting a brick fucking wall.
00:51:50 What does the vape, what does the fucking thing
00:51:53 call that goddamn asthmatics he uses?
00:51:55 I don't even know who that is, Doug.
00:51:56 An inhaler.
00:51:57 Jackie hits that vape, like my dad hit my mom when I came out.
00:52:02 Hey.
00:52:07 My deepest, my deepest apologies for your
00:52:10 oncoming emphysema.
00:52:13 Indeed.
00:52:13 I'll never forgive you.
00:52:14 Okay guys, let's, let's center ourselves here.
00:52:17 Yeah, center our chakras.
00:52:18 Let's, let's talk about how drama has objectively
00:52:22 zero worth and is a waste of all your time
00:52:24 to even engage it in, even a little bit.
00:52:25 I completely disagree, but I'm, this is what I can't hear
00:52:28 to argue with.
00:52:29 That's what I want to talk about.
00:52:30 Because the, the, the, the rowdy fucker stuff was fun
00:52:33 and you know, people liked it.
00:52:35 It was a great time.
00:52:36 It was completely fun to record and it was fun for all
00:52:39 of our audience.
00:52:40 It was fun for the whole family and everyone
00:52:41 enjoyed it.
00:52:42 I see, I see, I see the rowdy fucker stuff
00:52:45 as kind of like a version of like the digi
00:52:47 and that anime snob thing.
00:52:49 Cause it's like, like it's fun to shit on someone like that.
00:52:53 And like all at the end of the day, who gives a shit
00:52:55 what they have to say.
00:52:55 There's nothing at stake.
00:52:57 Both snob and F and GR, they deserve it because
00:53:01 they're dishing it out constantly.
00:53:03 And it's all anybody wants to see is for someone to come along.
00:53:08 Just want to go on, just want to go on the record and say
00:53:10 that F and GR is far inferior to Miss Anthropony.
00:53:13 F and GR is by far the greater building.
00:53:15 Oh, oh, oh yeah.
00:53:15 Miss Anthropony, I honestly don't have that much
00:53:18 hard feelings towards, you know, I don't like what
00:53:20 he said about me and, and my, and my brother, but you
00:53:23 know what, uh, F and GR is far worse.
00:53:26 And honestly, he should be eliminated from the game.
00:53:29 He should be himself.
00:53:30 Oh my God, he needs to be removed from the board.
00:53:34 My 20 player kill streak should end with all of him
00:53:36 being each 20 players that I kill.
00:53:38 And that's how I feel about the subject.
00:53:40 Okay, okay.
00:53:41 F and GR and that anime snob are both dudes who thrive on drama,
00:53:45 who think for some reason that everybody wants it.
00:53:49 Like, like that everybody wants them to do that.
00:53:52 And, and no, like, no, no one really does.
00:53:54 That's the excuse they make.
00:53:55 Yeah.
00:53:55 That's the excuse they make.
00:53:56 And I think that in both cases, there's a huge amount
00:53:59 of people just waiting in the wings, hoping someone
00:54:02 destroys these guys.
00:54:04 Yeah, they're not very smart.
00:54:05 And most people won't bother.
00:54:07 Like with, with that anime snob, like what, what
00:54:09 everybody always told me is like, just don't, don't
00:54:11 bother with them because like, what's the point?
00:54:13 You know, you're not going to change it.
00:54:13 I think I told you that too, but in hindsight, I, I
00:54:16 under, because on the one hand I hated that anime
00:54:18 snob and I didn't want him to gain the exposure
00:54:21 that would inevitably come from me talking about him.
00:54:23 But, but now with the benefit of hindsight, I can see
00:54:26 like why you would just for your own enjoyment and for
00:54:29 your own like catharsis.
00:54:29 Well, the thing about snob and FNGR is that they
00:54:32 will never stop.
00:54:33 They're both, both of those guys are in their late 30s.
00:54:36 Both of those are guys in their late 30s who've
00:54:38 been on the internet for decades who have been
00:54:41 doing the same thing forever and will continue to.
00:54:43 FNGR is still making weekly videos about the My Little
00:54:47 Pony fandom in 2017.
00:54:50 No, November 2017.
00:54:51 Like nothing's going to stop those two guys from
00:54:54 continuing to do that.
00:54:55 So like you're not going to, people are like, oh, if
00:54:57 you give him attention, it's just going to empower him.
00:55:00 Nothing's going to stop him.
00:55:02 Like he's always going to be doing this.
00:55:03 So you might as well just fucking shit on him for
00:55:05 the hell of it.
00:55:06 You, you will not be able, I'm totally with you.
00:55:08 You will not be able to stop people who wish to engage
00:55:10 in drama.
00:55:11 But here's what my, my argument would be that, but
00:55:14 your time can be better used than wasting it on
00:55:16 involving yourself with these people.
00:55:18 That's, that's true.
00:55:19 But like, you know, what are you going to be 100%
00:55:22 optimized all the time?
00:55:23 Are you going to be, are you going to be, are you
00:55:25 going to use your time constructively 100%
00:55:27 of the time, realistically?
00:55:29 Using my patented formula of weird utilitarianism
00:55:32 available at all CVSs for 1999, you can strive,
00:55:36 you can strive to achieve getting as close to that
00:55:38 goal as possible, which I think is what we should
00:55:40 all try to do.
00:55:41 That's my, you know, that's what I would want.
00:55:43 Here's my, I, I, like.
00:55:45 And certainly drama on this level is not something
00:55:47 that I would want to like overindulge in, or even make
00:55:49 like a regular, even make a regular part of my diet.
00:55:51 Can the value of drama be from that, it, it gives
00:55:54 your, it galvanizes your audience against something
00:55:57 and that kind of gives them something to be invested
00:56:00 in and enhance your personal narrative?
00:56:02 I, I even think, I would even admit that there is,
00:56:05 okay, but I would even admit that there is
00:56:07 entertainment value to drama.
00:56:08 I would say that it's limited and to keep everything,
00:56:10 keep things in perspective.
00:56:11 That's, that's all.
00:56:12 I mean, you don't want it to be your character.
00:56:13 I want to, I want to bring up this, this amazing
00:56:16 Dick Masterson quote that, that a really like for me
00:56:19 clinched like why drama is, is fine.
00:56:22 And he was talking about how, because a huge part
00:56:25 of the Dick show is him making fun of Maddox.
00:56:27 It's a huge part of it's the drama he has with Maddox
00:56:30 because of the fact that Maddox did all this shitty stuff
00:56:32 to him and continues to do shitty stuff to him.
00:56:33 And so Dick airs it all out immediately, partly
00:56:36 to protect himself because it makes it easier
00:56:39 for him to have all the cards if, you know,
00:56:41 if the public is swayed to his side.
00:56:44 But he also was talking about like the criticism
00:56:45 he always gets like this show just relies on drama.
00:56:47 And he said, I'm sorry that I provide serialized content
00:56:52 with deep archetypal characters who, you know,
00:56:55 who to tell you something about the world around you.
00:56:58 And like, yeah, it's, it's just a show.
00:57:00 Like what he's turned it into, he's taken real life
00:57:03 and turned it into a TV show.
00:57:06 And what we get out of a TV show is that it helps us
00:57:08 to better understand the world, you know, like looking
00:57:10 at Maddox and the particular ways that he fails
00:57:14 is actually kind of helpful to like dealing
00:57:16 with other people like Maddox.
00:57:18 You know, like it makes me look at him and go like,
00:57:20 oh, fuck, you know, now I get why that guy acts that way.
00:57:23 Because he's just like fucking Maddox.
00:57:25 The important distinction here, I think, is that Dick,
00:57:29 Dick is his own person with his own character.
00:57:31 He's not just defined by being the anti-Maddox guy.
00:57:34 And like that, that makes it, that makes it like mean
00:57:37 something that he has these opinions.
00:57:39 Right.
00:57:40 If you're, if you're like FNGR, oh, you're fucking,
00:57:42 your whole thing is you're in there coming down on people
00:57:46 left and right, nobody knows why, because what do you
00:57:48 fucking stand for other than to shit on people?
00:57:50 Like, you can't understand enough of what comes out
00:57:53 of his mouth to figure out what his stance is.
00:57:56 No, I mean, there's nothing, there's nothing
00:57:58 that could save that particular content.
00:58:01 That particular soul for being reaped
00:58:04 by fucking Satan himself.
00:58:06 His Kundalini is so wicked and fucking, you know,
00:58:09 twisted up that you can't even straighten out
00:58:11 even if you want to.
00:58:12 The day of reckoning is coming.
00:58:14 His Merkaba is artificial as fuck.
00:58:16 And he's going, he's not going to go well for him.
00:58:19 He was one of the original Martians that came to Earth
00:58:22 and then, you know, integrated into the population,
00:58:24 and he's just so greedy and power-driven that he needs to stop.
00:58:26 FNGR is fully, fully left brain, fully mental.
00:58:30 Indeed.
00:58:30 At least a proto-masculine ideology will not
00:58:33 survive the test to come.
00:58:34 They will not endure.
00:58:36 Is this spirit science shit you guys are about right now?
00:58:38 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:58:38 Of course, of course.
00:58:40 Okay, I got to ask, do you think that that's,
00:58:42 is spirit science where the mind expansion meme came from?
00:58:46 Because that imagery is in there all the fucking time.
00:58:49 I was just like, I don't know, I don't know.
00:58:51 Me and May got really baked and watched spirit science
00:58:53 yesterday and that shit feels, dude, it feels so weird
00:58:58 because it feels like, like a parody of an educational video
00:59:02 that will be in a movie.
00:59:03 It does, it does.
00:59:04 I'm still not sold that it's not a fucking joke.
00:59:07 I'm sure it's real.
00:59:09 But like the comments, we weren't sure.
00:59:11 We read this guy.
00:59:12 This guy named like, it was, it was like Bobo the Bacon Lord
00:59:16 or something like that.
00:59:17 And he had this comment that I read and it was, it was,
00:59:20 it was amazing and I just was stewing over like whether it
00:59:24 was a troll comment or not.
00:59:25 Like I couldn't tell.
00:59:26 It was fascinating.
00:59:27 I highly recommend going to watch spirit science
00:59:30 and reading the comments because it's just,
00:59:32 it's just getting lost.
00:59:33 It's, it's again, it's like the genius thing where,
00:59:35 where it's so out there.
00:59:37 You can't believe it's real.
00:59:39 But it, but it must be real.
00:59:41 I learned, I did some research and I found something
00:59:44 interesting.
00:59:44 I'm going to share with you.
00:59:45 It shed some light on spirit science because in that
00:59:47 fucking history of humanity or whatever video,
00:59:50 he talks about thought.
00:59:51 He talks about like the, the Egyptian god thought,
00:59:53 like reveals these things and that's how we know.
00:59:55 And I was like, how are you talking to him?
00:59:57 Like where is this source?
00:59:59 And I looked it up and it turns out that in that video,
01:00:01 he references a book and the book is by some guy.
01:00:04 And in this book, this guy who wrote it,
01:00:06 claims that he has like met this like ancient,
01:00:10 like time traveling wizard who is like the Egyptian god.
01:00:13 So basically all of this is based on one guy's book
01:00:16 where he says that like a fucking time traveler visited
01:00:19 him and told me this stuff.
01:00:20 Dude, I didn't know that.
01:00:22 I didn't know that.
01:00:22 Yeah, that's what the whole thought thing is about.
01:00:24 Anytime you can't, anytime you're sitting there
01:00:26 watching spirit science debating yourself,
01:00:28 whether it's real or not, just remember that every
01:00:31 religion is real and they are all
01:00:34 fucking weird as that.
01:00:36 We just grew up hearing it, so it doesn't seem as weird.
01:00:38 But if you told, if you described like the,
01:00:41 the stories of the Old Testament to somebody
01:00:44 who did not grow up with them, they're just gonna
01:00:45 look you like, what in the fuck are you talking about?
01:00:48 Like that is fucking insanity.
01:00:50 I don't know if this constitutes as like drama,
01:00:51 but me and Munchie, we're, we're watching the videos
01:00:53 at one point, we were considering doing something
01:00:55 similar to a ratty fucker's cop killer's
01:00:57 like four spirit science.
01:00:59 And I think it could be like the greatest idea of all time.
01:01:02 I would like to do that in the somewhat near future,
01:01:05 before the world ends, of course, and before we
01:01:07 re-reach the end of the perception of the Equinox
01:01:09 and we turn back into our spa and sleep phase.
01:01:11 We have to use our third eye while it's still open,
01:01:14 if you know what I mean.
01:01:16 The world needs to see this shit.
01:01:17 It's unbelievable.
01:01:18 Okay, okay, well.
01:01:19 We haven't been watched the human history movie
01:01:21 in its entirety, by the way, and it was a
01:01:23 transcendent experience.
01:01:24 It shed a lot of light on a lot of things for me.
01:01:27 Yeah, it really does a lot of clarify.
01:01:29 Let's get back to our topic with the drama.
01:01:31 We've been sitting into the spirit science episode.
01:01:33 I'm just saying, I'm just saying, there were a lot.
01:01:35 Oh my god, we should have a praise consciousness episode.
01:01:38 That's a great idea.
01:01:39 I'm right there, Dan, right now.
01:01:41 I'm just saying it really shed light on a lot
01:01:43 of the mysteries that I had not understood,
01:01:45 like the, like the energy networks permeating the earth.
01:01:47 I'd always wondered.
01:01:48 And that's why all those military bases are on this grid,
01:01:51 on these tiny islands.
01:01:53 On the nodes, they're on the spirit nodes, dude.
01:01:56 It all makes sense.
01:01:58 Let's get into maybe the negative effects of drama.
01:02:03 Yeah, I want to start that off with saying that I, too,
01:02:05 have had a Derek in my life.
01:02:07 And eventually, he became like a joke to me.
01:02:12 I would eventually just go to my friend's house,
01:02:14 and whenever we would talk, we would just be like,
01:02:17 hey, I wonder what this guy's doing.
01:02:19 I bet he's fucking that kid, if you know what I mean.
01:02:22 And so it would just turn into such like valuable entertainment.
01:02:28 That would be better than watching a movie.
01:02:30 It would just be us like thinking about what he's done
01:02:32 and what kind of a person he is.
01:02:34 And, you know, picking apart like the characterization of him
01:02:37 and like, you know, writing fan fictions about himself
01:02:39 in our brain.
01:02:40 And that became our entertainment.
01:02:42 And basically it was an entire, it was a great time.
01:02:45 And the negative effects of drama is that it is inherently
01:02:50 unsustainable.
01:02:51 Like these people, the guy, it is an instigator.
01:02:54 And he, you know, obviously when you're an instigator,
01:02:56 you want to start drama.
01:02:58 So when you start drama, and that's your entire deal,
01:03:01 then eventually it's going to get to the point
01:03:02 where the drama you make is going to be about you
01:03:05 and you are going to be the drama that is removed.
01:03:08 You are going to be like, like-
01:03:10 I think that's kind of what has happened to Snob.
01:03:12 Like no one pays attention to him anymore
01:03:14 because all anybody knows about him is that he wants to start drama.
01:03:16 Yeah, that's what I was saying before.
01:03:18 Like drama can be fun and all, but if you become,
01:03:20 if you become a drama person,
01:03:22 then you become the one causing the drama.
01:03:25 He did get literally booted from the platform.
01:03:27 So that didn't help his visibility exactly.
01:03:28 It's like, when you are trying to start shit with someone,
01:03:32 that's exactly what we're doing.
01:03:33 You're starting shit with someone.
01:03:35 And after a while, they're just going to be like,
01:03:36 okay, well, this isn't fucking worth it.
01:03:38 And then they're going to cut you out.
01:03:39 It isn't inherently like, once you go down that road,
01:03:42 unless you fucking do it in absolute sincerity and beauty,
01:03:47 you know, as depicted, the right-of-hook is cop killers,
01:03:50 then you can easily tumble and fucking fall
01:03:53 and eventually become the very, like when you want it,
01:03:55 like say if you like don't like someone,
01:03:57 when someone does and you start, you know,
01:03:59 taking the piss out of them and do that constantly,
01:04:01 then eventually you're going to be the one
01:04:03 that people hate and want to take the piss out of
01:04:04 and eliminate from society.
01:04:06 If you indulge too much in drama and you love drama
01:04:09 and like drama is a source of enjoyment for you
01:04:12 and becomes like too much of that,
01:04:13 then what eventually happens is you might run out
01:04:16 of other drama and you will be like fucking hooked on it
01:04:19 and you will feel the need to start it where none exists.
01:04:22 You'll have to create, you'll have to create new drama
01:04:24 so that there will be drama for like your life
01:04:27 because you need it.
01:04:28 If you develop that appetite, you will need to feed.
01:04:33 Drama is best served as a side dish and not a main course.
01:04:37 I gotta say though, like it's,
01:04:39 the best is when drama just falls in your lap.
01:04:42 That's when it's truly beautiful.
01:04:43 Yeah, that's why I think it's an opportunity.
01:04:46 Exactly, it's just giving me permission.
01:04:48 It's like life handing me a sledgehammer
01:04:50 and then putting a watermelon in front of me
01:04:52 and being like go ahead, dude.
01:04:54 That's what it was with Forever World a few months ago
01:04:58 where this, I just made a video about anime streaming
01:05:01 and some idiot YouTuber just like decides to start drama
01:05:05 for no reason.
01:05:05 He's just like saying all this shit about me
01:05:08 and like contacting my sponsors,
01:05:10 like contacting Crunchyroll and being like how dare you break.
01:05:13 Yeah, the reason I came at Forever World so hard
01:05:17 is that he got on Twitter
01:05:18 and was like at messaging Crunchyroll
01:05:20 and Miles from Crunchyroll, like sending them my video
01:05:22 and being like how dare you have this person at your convention
01:05:25 when he's like anti, when he's anti legal streaming
01:05:29 or whatever, which I'm not,
01:05:30 and he completely misinterpreted the video.
01:05:33 So for me, I was just like,
01:05:35 oh, this is such a beautiful opportunity.
01:05:37 You know, like this is such a-
01:05:38 Forever World is a dummy who just misunderstood your point.
01:05:41 I thought you're just like, no, never pay anything,
01:05:43 even though you literally pay for whatever.
01:05:45 It's not what you want.
01:05:46 It's okay.
01:05:49 It was just that feeling of seeing this guy
01:05:51 who I've never really watched his content
01:05:52 because I mean, it's terrible, you know,
01:05:54 and it's like I have every reason to fight this dude
01:05:57 because there's nothing I can gain from being friend.
01:05:59 Like nobody likes him that I know.
01:06:01 You know, there's no bridge that I'm worried about burning.
01:06:03 So this guy just drops-
01:06:04 This guy's number one fan right here,
01:06:05 see my little on a seven on the plate real quick.
01:06:07 You can engage with drama and it can be fine
01:06:10 as long as your hands are clean.
01:06:11 Like, but if you're the one stirring the pot,
01:06:13 it's dangerous and people will come at you for it.
01:06:15 The best part is that he has more subscribers than me.
01:06:18 So it wasn't like I was punching down.
01:06:20 It's like a guy-
01:06:21 You could unshackle the beast.
01:06:22 Oh, he handed me himself on a platter.
01:06:24 And as soon as he did, I fucking railed him.
01:06:26 And he actually like has continued to talk shit about me
01:06:31 in like live streams and stuff,
01:06:32 but he seems to be keeping it on the down low.
01:06:34 Like, so like, for now, I'm just like, oh, whatever,
01:06:37 you know, everybody know, like after I made my video,
01:06:39 everybody told me like, yeah, everybody knows he's retarded.
01:06:41 Like it's not a big deal.
01:06:42 And I was like, okay, well, I'm not going to keep picking on him
01:06:45 if nobody takes him seriously.
01:06:46 But like, you know, but at the same time,
01:06:48 it's like, just give me the push, dude.
01:06:50 Just come back.
01:06:51 You know, just come make another video about me.
01:06:53 I'm ready, you know.
01:06:54 Here's the thing that's frustrating me.
01:06:56 And it's, this is semi drama related,
01:06:58 but it's the idea of sort of the prodigal son.
01:07:01 You know, the story of the prodigal son,
01:07:03 who, you know, from the Bible and shit.
01:07:05 So there was a father with two sons.
01:07:06 He had one son that was a good old boy
01:07:08 and just did his homework and did his chores
01:07:10 and drank his milk and grew up being strong.
01:07:12 The other son left home and was a big fuck up.
01:07:15 And like the son who stayed around, like,
01:07:18 like he just continued to do his job diligently.
01:07:20 And the father, you know, I thought it was okay.
01:07:22 But then the fuck up son comes home and like begs for help.
01:07:25 Or he's just like, dad, oh, I fucked up, please help me.
01:07:27 And like the Bible says, like canonically,
01:07:30 the father loves the fuck up son way more
01:07:34 than like the son who stayed around and was the good old boy.
01:07:36 And this is evident in like every level of human interaction
01:07:39 that like people love like redemption stories
01:07:42 or like people getting saved from shit.
01:07:44 So like, I feel like like drama is one of the ways
01:07:47 that bad behavior is rewarded.
01:07:49 And not just because like you start,
01:07:51 like even if you like bad intentions
01:07:54 are what get rewarded when people do this stuff.
01:07:56 Like if you, like if someone starts drama
01:07:59 and then gets called out because like,
01:08:00 or someone doesn't commit a crime
01:08:01 and then they are redeemed some way,
01:08:03 that person will be more loved
01:08:05 than the person who did nothing wrong the entire time.
01:08:07 And like drama is very much related to this.
01:08:10 And this is a little different,
01:08:12 but like it's the idea of how many times have we seen
01:08:14 people whose YouTube channels got deleted
01:08:17 and then like a gigantic campaign starts
01:08:19 every single time.
01:08:21 I have ever seen someone's channel deleted
01:08:22 for like not for like legitimate reasons.
01:08:24 It comes back and surges in popularity every single,
01:08:28 I want YouTube to delete my channel.
01:08:31 YouTube, please delete best guy ever
01:08:33 so I can do a fucking campaign
01:08:35 and double my size instantly.
01:08:36 It will happen.
01:08:37 It will happen.
01:08:38 I'll tell you that never, it never helped me.
01:08:40 I've had my channel deleted twice.
01:08:42 It never caused a surge,
01:08:43 but I also never made a big fucking deal about it.
01:08:45 Well, there's your issue right there.
01:08:46 You got to make, you got to cry and scream.
01:08:48 Right, just indignation.
01:08:50 Exactly.
01:08:51 Okay, but that is true.
01:08:52 Maybe, maybe it doesn't double everybody's size
01:08:54 all the time, but it never hurts
01:08:56 as long as you actually get the channel back.
01:08:57 I mean, yeah, that's, that's, that's been fun.
01:09:00 It did probably increase my Patreon though,
01:09:02 because like people just get worried about you, I guess.
01:09:04 That's the most important, yeah, yeah.
01:09:06 Start going money at you, which is interesting, you know?
01:09:09 So that's the concept I'm talking about here.
01:09:11 It's like this, when you're filled
01:09:13 with the righteous indignation here.
01:09:15 Yeah, and I'm not, like, obviously.
01:09:16 That is why the Dick Show is so successful.
01:09:19 Like, the Dick Show, the Dick Show is already
01:09:21 a successful podcast.
01:09:23 It probably had like seven grand before
01:09:27 Maddox made his big Dick Lies video
01:09:31 and a couple weeks, like a month later,
01:09:34 it had like 20 grand.
01:09:36 You know, like people were,
01:09:37 it was the anger people had towards Maddox
01:09:40 that spurned them to raise their donations to Dick.
01:09:44 And the fact that Dick capitalized on it so well
01:09:46 by making it such a good story, you know?
01:09:48 Whereas Maddox was being silent, like a fucking idiot.
01:09:51 And Maddox is effective at like,
01:09:53 Maddox is effective at like, since he is famous,
01:09:56 he's good at like giving other people stuff.
01:09:58 By attacking them, he gives them, you know,
01:10:02 like Dick achieves success in this way
01:10:04 through Maddox fucking with them.
01:10:06 And like, but he can't do it for himself
01:10:08 is the point I'm trying to get to.
01:10:09 He like, it's, I don't know, what the fuck is he doing?
01:10:11 It's because he's a fucking idiot, that's why.
01:10:16 Anyway.
01:10:16 Well, the man did literally invent the internet,
01:10:18 so credit for that.
01:10:18 I wanted to talk about the negative effects of drama.
01:10:22 The main ones that I've felt, mostly that
01:10:26 whether or not the person you have drama with
01:10:28 takes it seriously, some of their fans will take it very seriously.
01:10:34 And they will come, like, there was a few,
01:10:38 like the people who were the most mad at me
01:10:40 when I made my shit talking anime YouTubers video
01:10:42 were not anybody who I talked shit about in the video.
01:10:45 It was other auxiliary people who thought,
01:10:49 like who were just upset that I had done that.
01:10:52 The worst, I'm just gonna call them out.
01:10:54 Let's start drama right now.
01:10:55 Oh, there we go.
01:10:57 It would not be a drama cast without it.
01:10:58 All right.
01:10:59 The worst of them all is Nolan B from the pizza party podcast.
01:11:04 Oh my god.
01:11:05 Because that guy had invited me onto the podcast,
01:11:08 he was a big fan of me, he invited me onto the pizza party.
01:11:11 I just have to mention that pan pizza is a meme,
01:11:14 like that I hate him so much that he is a meme
01:11:16 in my own circle of friends, so I'm very excited to hear.
01:11:18 Apparently my friend Blind Skywatcher,
01:11:21 like obsessively watches his videos as a meme,
01:11:24 like because he's like deeply fascinated.
01:11:26 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:11:27 But yeah, so the pizza party podcast
01:11:29 was a very popular podcast, apparently.
01:11:32 I was invited on by Nolan B,
01:11:35 nobody else in the podcast really knew who I was.
01:11:36 It was kind of a mediocre show.
01:11:39 I didn't really enjoy doing it.
01:11:41 They edit the shit out of that podcast,
01:11:42 like they cut out all the silences and they speed it up,
01:11:45 so it sounds way better than it actually is to record.
01:11:48 But after that, he kept trying to stay in contact with me,
01:11:52 but I never really responded because I didn't really know the guy
01:11:54 and a lot of the stuff he would ask me is stuff you could
01:11:56 just find out by watching my videos.
01:11:58 So I kind of kept him at arm's length.
01:12:00 After I made the shit talking anime YouTuber's video,
01:12:02 that dude writes this huge screen about what a piece of shit I am
01:12:06 for doing that and just all this stuff
01:12:08 about how I'm like a monster on his Tumblr
01:12:11 and released it publicly and was just shitting on me
01:12:14 on Twitter and stuff, all this out of nowhere
01:12:17 because he was mad on other people's behalf.
01:12:19 Nobody who was insulted in the video was even angry about it.
01:12:24 But this dude goes fucking ham and I was just like,
01:12:28 this is like, this is the, on the one hand,
01:12:30 this is a negative effect of starting drama,
01:12:32 is that you got to deal with people like this.
01:12:34 On the other hand, you also get the fun of,
01:12:37 you know, like showing all your friends this guy
01:12:39 and going like, look at this fucking idiot, you know,
01:12:42 which is very gratifying in itself.
01:12:44 I think we've all done that at least.
01:12:46 Like whether we start open drama, when people come at you,
01:12:50 it's so satisfying to show your friends and point and laugh at them.
01:12:53 Oh, definitely. That guy, by the way, on that guy,
01:12:57 I forget how I found his Twitter,
01:12:59 but apparently he's like still going hard on like the PCP itself
01:13:04 is horrible and we're all bunch of crazy losers.
01:13:07 Yeah, yeah. Oh, wow. I didn't know that.
01:13:09 Can we start some, can we start?
01:13:10 Let's start some fucking drama.
01:13:12 Do we have a P?
01:13:12 Hey, Peter Party podcast is a bigger podcast than us.
01:13:15 In PCP versus PPP.
01:13:17 PCP versus PPP, dude.
01:13:19 We've got it.
01:13:19 It's that C versus P. It's that C in that P.
01:13:23 Wait, wait, wait.
01:13:24 Oh, god.
01:13:25 C, P.
01:13:26 Fuck.
01:13:26 Can we, can we?
01:13:26 Oh, no.
01:13:27 We need to do a few, we need to do a few months of research
01:13:30 to categorize the actual accusations made.
01:13:32 Yeah.
01:13:32 Before, before I jump into that, I will say we do have,
01:13:34 Prepare a legal case.
01:13:35 We do have shared audience with them.
01:13:37 I know that.
01:13:38 I know that there are people who like both our podcasts and theirs,
01:13:41 which means it's even a better reason to start drama.
01:13:43 Oh, my god.
01:13:44 I have an idea.
01:13:45 Oh, my god.
01:13:46 Do you think they'll go?
01:13:47 Do you think they would bite if we deliberately started drama?
01:13:51 You've already got one guy who hates drama.
01:13:53 Maybe I'll listen.
01:13:54 Maybe I'll go listen to some just as he,
01:13:55 because I may not listen to them.
01:13:56 I have to have legitimate grievances,
01:13:57 but the fact that they should talk you is,
01:14:00 that's like the first bullet in my clip already.
01:14:02 That's a good springboard.
01:14:04 I don't remember if he took down that Tumblr post,
01:14:07 but like, if I could find it, if you guys read that thing,
01:14:09 you'd be like, oh, god.
01:14:11 I remember reading this at the time.
01:14:12 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:14:13 But I want to know where he,
01:14:15 I'm curious about what he said about the PCP in specific.
01:14:17 Yeah, because that doesn't have some skin in the game now.
01:14:20 It's just some offhand comments like the PCP.
01:14:25 He has the same air that Vita did in that first Miss Anthropony Vita.
01:14:30 Like, oh, Munchie, I don't watch that channel.
01:14:32 I have standards.
01:14:33 Well, I mean, hey, that's cool and all, guys,
01:14:36 but the PCP doesn't feel the need to heavily edit
01:14:39 and speed up its audio in order to be into it.
01:14:41 Yeah, just saying.
01:14:42 Yeah!
01:14:43 I'm about over here.
01:14:44 Just fucking saying.
01:14:46 By the way, I do have an old grievance
01:14:48 with Rebel Taxi in that he's one of the legions of people
01:14:54 who made disgusting and unworthy Gern Lagen reviews
01:14:57 that I had to correct on my channel.
01:14:59 So you're welcome for that Rebel Taxi.
01:15:01 Your scene has been washed away.
01:15:03 Let's do it.
01:15:04 The funniest thing about this,
01:15:05 if we did start a drama with them deliberately,
01:15:08 is that our entire audience would know we were doing it
01:15:11 just to fuck with them and troll and start drama.
01:15:13 That's true.
01:15:14 Like, everyone in our audience knows what we're doing,
01:15:17 but it would be so funny.
01:15:19 I'm so happy that this character arc that has been like,
01:15:23 this storyline that has started within my group of friends
01:15:27 is becoming a real thing,
01:15:28 not a joke that is actually transpiring in real life now.
01:15:34 Oh, how fortuitous.
01:15:35 I know, it's terrible.
01:15:38 Well, is there anything else to say on the subject?
01:15:41 Or should we move on to questions?
01:15:42 I think we'll run the...
01:15:44 I mean, I don't know.
01:15:45 Drama is good unless it isn't, most of the time it isn't,
01:15:48 but sometimes, mwah.
01:15:50 Oh, I wasn't...
01:15:51 It's a great spice on top of your normal content.
01:15:55 Yeah, there was one more negative consequence of drama
01:15:57 I wanted to bring up,
01:15:58 which is just that because I personally have started
01:16:02 so much drama, it seems like a lot of smaller creators
01:16:06 are afraid of me.
01:16:08 A lot of people seem tepid about approaching me.
01:16:11 I don't know if that's more because I'm popular
01:16:14 or if it's because of the drama.
01:16:15 I think I may have seen that a little bit.
01:16:16 But it seems like both.
01:16:16 Maybe.
01:16:17 I've definitely had people seem like they're afraid to approach me
01:16:23 and when they want to ask me for something,
01:16:25 for a project, it's always like they'll do it
01:16:28 through somebody else I know or try to work their way in.
01:16:33 And I'm like, dude, I've talked to my fans in the comment sections.
01:16:36 I'm not hard to reach.
01:16:37 Yeah, yeah.
01:16:37 I mean, so people should have a normal amount of trepidation
01:16:41 about trying to show something to someone
01:16:43 who you might be wasting their time.
01:16:44 Not even that.
01:16:45 Like, for instance, I mean, there's the big anti-tuber chat room
01:16:50 that I was initially not added to.
01:16:53 Jeff claims that's because he forgot to send me the message.
01:16:56 Oh, fucking yeah.
01:16:57 But I had heard that there was some trepidation
01:17:00 about whether I should be invited
01:17:02 because I might hate everyone in there
01:17:04 and start a bunch of shit, which is like,
01:17:06 it's just a mischaracterization of like,
01:17:08 yes, I get into drama, but it's usually because we've reached.
01:17:12 We've reached for a specific reason that hasn't been laid
01:17:15 over the course of millennia.
01:17:16 We've reached the end of a rope, and it has to,
01:17:18 something has to give.
01:17:20 And I'm not willing to stay quiet forever the way
01:17:22 a lot of people are, you know?
01:17:23 But I'm not like, it's not like if you start talking to me,
01:17:26 I'm going to flip shit on you and make a video about you
01:17:29 immediately, you know?
01:17:30 Just because you like said hi.
01:17:31 I think that was, yeah.
01:17:32 I get a lot too, weirdly enough.
01:17:35 A lot of fans that always be like, you know, Munchie,
01:17:38 like, I'm really sorry, please don't kill me.
01:17:40 I don't want to die.
01:17:42 Please, and of course I kill them instantly.
01:17:45 Of course I don't allow them the time to prove themselves.
01:17:48 Whereas if they had faced me unblinking
01:17:50 with the sheer terror they could on their face,
01:17:52 then I might have spared them.
01:17:53 I could sense that Kundalini was severed,
01:17:56 and I needed to fucking chop it into a million pieces.
01:17:59 Exactly.
01:18:01 Currently in one piece, Big Mom has this power where,
01:18:04 actually, you know what, I won't spoil it,
01:18:05 never mind, forget it.
01:18:06 Excellent.
01:18:07 It was relevant, but I'm not going to spoil it.
01:18:09 Life is just a big game of Beyblade,
01:18:13 and everyone's Merkabah is their Beyblade,
01:18:15 and you just have to crash your Merkabahs into each other,
01:18:17 and whichever one breaks is the loser and die.
01:18:20 That's just a game, and you're a new.
01:18:23 I don't feel the need, I guess, to go into it in detail,
01:18:26 but I personally choose, in general, to live my life
01:18:30 like just talking about ideas.
01:18:32 I know I say this a million times,
01:18:33 just whatever, like Elna Roosevelt,
01:18:35 like big people talk about ideas,
01:18:37 whatever, small people talk about people.
01:18:39 Whatever the fucking quote is, you know the one thing.
01:18:40 And I try to do everything by that,
01:18:42 and I just think it makes the most sense.
01:18:43 And Best Guy Ever talks about Star Trek.
01:18:46 Hey, Star Trek's not bad, you could do worse.
01:18:48 You could do worse.
01:18:49 Especially Star Trek Discovery on Sundays at 7 p.m. on NBC.
01:18:53 To me.
01:18:53 No, I'm just kidding, I don't know.
01:18:54 Drama is just like, treat it as if you're watching
01:18:57 like a funny YouTube video,
01:18:59 and expend that exact amount of time on it,
01:19:01 a.k.a. like, you know, not that long per day, if at all.
01:19:05 And just use it as a funny entertainment.
01:19:08 Every once in a blue moon.
01:19:11 Yep.
01:19:12 Yeah, that's how I feel about it.
01:19:13 That's good, good, good.
01:19:15 And when your friends wrong you in any way,
01:19:19 please go to your other friends
01:19:20 and shit talk about them constantly.
01:19:22 Preferably while hot boxing, vape in a car.
01:19:27 That, there you go.
01:19:28 That's my strategy.
01:19:29 That's the news from the street, from Munchiewares.
01:19:32 Tiny hats, I feel like I'm gonna regret
01:19:35 that I potentially just started more drama with Nolan B.
01:19:38 Like, I already regret having said anything.
01:19:40 What have I done?
01:19:42 Oh God, what have I done?
01:19:44 His podcast is gay and so is he.
01:19:46 Okay, he's done.
01:19:47 We need to start a PCP drama
01:19:49 when you told us to take it out,
01:19:50 but we didn't cut it out.
01:19:51 Now you're mad at all of us,
01:19:53 and we begin, the destruction begins.
01:19:55 Who's the Maddox of the PCP?
01:19:58 Davoo.
01:20:00 Yeah.
01:20:01 Oh, he will be very insulted to hear that.
01:20:03 But anyway, thanks.
01:20:04 All right, let's do some questions
01:20:06 while we're doing this motherfucker.
01:20:08 Let's do it, everybody.
01:20:10 Okay, how about, this isn't a question,
01:20:13 at Janiz Makudobaru, when is they progress?
01:20:16 Maybe there's a bingo board.
01:20:17 I'm finding that him and all of his fans
01:20:20 seem to shit talk us pretty regularly, so.
01:20:23 Well, all right.
01:20:24 Okay, we'll look into this.
01:20:25 We'll look into it like we'll update you.
01:20:27 We'll really know next episode what's about to inspire.
01:20:30 I'm for real gonna fucking look into this,
01:20:32 and if there's fucking shit being slung,
01:20:34 I'm gonna have something to say about it.
01:20:37 Whether or not he's slinging shit,
01:20:38 there definitely seems to be a sentiment
01:20:40 among people who follow him that is very anti-PCP.
01:20:43 Okay, okay.
01:20:44 Oh my god.
01:20:45 What was Janiz Makudobaru?
01:20:47 This is gonna be our first Moby Dick.
01:20:48 This is gonna be the whale that we have
01:20:49 to fucking spear through the heart.
01:20:53 This is gonna be our fucking,
01:20:54 we're gonna have our wiggling day
01:20:55 where we have to fucking face the seven trials
01:20:58 and come out as baby trolls.
01:21:00 We've been assembling this motley crew
01:21:03 for just such a promised day.
01:21:05 For the record, the opinions of some PCP members
01:21:08 do not reflect the opinions of others.
01:21:10 Anybody who does not want to be involved in this drama
01:21:12 is not involved in this drama.
01:21:13 Do not throw everybody under the bus of the PCP
01:21:16 just because me and Ben and Munchy happen to be.
01:21:21 This has nothing to do with anybody
01:21:23 who's not on this episode.
01:21:24 None of them give a fuck about Nolan B
01:21:27 or the Pizza Party podcast, I'm sure.
01:21:29 Unless they at least not yet.
01:21:32 Yeah, at least not yet.
01:21:33 They will, they will.
01:21:34 The only reason I'm so enthusiastic
01:21:36 is because whenever I see a pan pizza video thumbnail,
01:21:39 I just laugh so hard that I cry.
01:21:43 I gotta check this out.
01:21:44 Okay, whatever.
01:21:45 All right, listen.
01:21:46 Listen, this is bullshit.
01:21:46 I'm just seriously interested.
01:21:48 Okay, good.
01:21:49 Update us.
01:21:50 Here's the thing.
01:21:50 At Janny's Muckin' Tomorrow asks,
01:21:53 or doesn't ask, but says,
01:21:54 when does a procrastinator's bingo board getting made
01:21:57 get on it, fans?
01:21:58 And I actually think that'd be a great idea
01:22:00 when listening to the PCP.
01:22:01 I'm surprised we haven't done that yet.
01:22:02 That should be a real thing.
01:22:03 I think maybe because we have a rotating cast,
01:22:07 maybe every individual member
01:22:08 would need their own bingo board.
01:22:09 Oh, that's a bad idea.
01:22:11 Because if it was something like
01:22:12 Nate's Weird Utilitarian,
01:22:14 well, I mean, that doesn't count
01:22:14 because you're on every episode.
01:22:15 But if it's something like...
01:22:16 I don't have to be though.
01:22:17 But if it's something like, you know,
01:22:18 Tom Bowman leaves your writing in the first place.
01:22:21 Every time Ben vapes or fucks up Eddie.
01:22:23 Yeah, yeah.
01:22:24 I made a drinking game with that already.
01:22:26 Yeah, we already did the drinking game
01:22:28 with all these things you guys are freaking up.
01:22:30 That's true.
01:22:31 That seems more our speed than a bingo board
01:22:33 to be honest.
01:22:34 Oh, okay.
01:22:35 Well, whatever.
01:22:35 Bingo board.
01:22:36 Well, some fan wants to make a bingo board.
01:22:37 Please do.
01:22:38 Yeah, please.
01:22:38 This is interesting.
01:22:39 If you want to do all the heavy lifting for us
01:22:41 because we're just too busy
01:22:43 with all this amazing content.
01:22:45 We'll retweet it so everyone could use it.
01:22:47 For sure.
01:22:47 From the procrastinator's Patreon lounge,
01:22:50 don't enter our Patreon for just one measly
01:22:53 miniscule of a dollar.
01:22:55 And you'll get in and we'll fuck you.
01:22:57 Yeah.
01:22:57 Remewersalists.
01:22:58 And if you're in the Discord,
01:23:00 you're much more likely to have your questions
01:23:01 right on the show.
01:23:03 Exactly.
01:23:03 A question from-
01:23:05 No, I want to say by Garbage Burner,
01:23:08 who's the worst pair of you on the podcast?
01:23:10 Like who of us?
01:23:12 You know, there's these social social media
01:23:13 podcasts, The Right Focus Cop Killers and all of that.
01:23:15 Who would be the worst two people to have
01:23:18 on a podcast at any given time?
01:23:19 I think me and Davoo,
01:23:21 even though I really like Davoo,
01:23:24 I remember you and Davoo did not gel at all
01:23:26 on the first Rowdy fuckers.
01:23:28 Yeah.
01:23:28 Davoo did not know what to make of you.
01:23:30 We gel kind of real in real life,
01:23:33 like a little bit.
01:23:34 I mean, it was more like we have a lot to say
01:23:35 about Mario and Luigi, but other than that.
01:23:37 Yeah.
01:23:38 And when I'm trying to fucking sleep
01:23:39 at like 3 a.m. in the goddamn morning,
01:23:42 you worthless creatures.
01:23:45 I think, I'm going to say me and Jesse,
01:23:47 because we do not see eye to eye on anything.
01:23:50 And even like as far back as the show has gone,
01:23:54 there have been things that Jesse has said
01:23:55 that I have tried to argue.
01:23:56 Like I remember we're talking about like
01:23:58 attitudes towards fans and stuff
01:24:00 and like attitudes towards criticism.
01:24:01 And I have, it has made me so mad before.
01:24:04 And I have, and it just does not,
01:24:07 it's not, but not in a good way.
01:24:08 You know, a lot of us approach things differently.
01:24:10 The problem with this question is that
01:24:12 it depends on what the podcast is about.
01:24:14 Like, I think, that is true.
01:24:16 Just in general.
01:24:17 I think if Ben and Jesse were doing a podcast
01:24:20 about like a specific game they both liked,
01:24:22 they would have an incredibly in-depth conversation
01:24:24 and both notice a bunch of shit
01:24:26 that the rest of us wouldn't.
01:24:28 Because you're both like very attentive viewers.
01:24:30 I think if Davoo and Munchy had a conversation
01:24:34 about like weird art.
01:24:36 Like weird, like deep web art.
01:24:39 It would be a fascinating podcast.
01:24:40 So like any combination of us,
01:24:42 it's just a matter of finding the thing
01:24:44 that the two of us can discuss, you know?
01:24:46 I agree, I agree.
01:24:48 I asked Davoo to which he replied,
01:24:50 ha ha, if you wanted to do an arm retrieval
01:24:52 about the Kirby anime.
01:24:54 And I think that would be hilarious.
01:24:56 That sounds like a good plan.
01:24:58 Yeah.
01:24:59 Hey, listen to this question.
01:25:00 Me and Davoo were gonna do,
01:25:01 like when we were in Atlanta,
01:25:02 we were walking around and Davoo was saying
01:25:04 that we should do like a two-person show
01:25:06 about like weird art.
01:25:07 And I was into it at the time,
01:25:09 but it never got brought up again.
01:25:10 What a shame.
01:25:12 There's still time.
01:25:12 There's still time.
01:25:13 Hey, let's do this question here.
01:25:15 At Mozu Disposition asks,
01:25:17 is Reverse Bukake pro-feminist?
01:25:20 Now first of all, first of all,
01:25:22 can someone explain to me what the fuck Reverse is?
01:25:24 Yeah, yeah, that's what it asks.
01:25:26 Secreting?
01:25:27 No, no, no, this is a girl stuffing
01:25:29 the cum on her body back into your dick.
01:25:33 I assume it's a girl squirting on a guy.
01:25:37 Okay, I checked it out
01:25:38 and I went to my friend Urban Dictionary
01:25:40 and he told me that Reverse Bukake
01:25:42 is the actor of one man being ejaculated
01:25:44 on by a group of girls.
01:25:45 So there you go.
01:25:46 Is that pro-feminist?
01:25:47 I'm gonna say it's like it.
01:25:49 No, no.
01:25:49 No?
01:25:49 No?
01:25:50 Why?
01:25:50 It's still a cuss.
01:25:51 Because it's still meant for a guy to jack off to.
01:25:54 This is a really hard question.
01:25:55 Let's move on to another one.
01:25:57 This is bullshit.
01:25:58 You're scared of...
01:25:59 You fear women's power.
01:26:00 That's why you want to get away from this question.
01:26:02 Of course I do.
01:26:03 Of course.
01:26:04 Student of Ethereum
01:26:06 who always asks like a thousand questions
01:26:08 on every episode,
01:26:09 but they're usually all right ones in there.
01:26:11 Favorite internet content creator
01:26:12 who isn't making content anymore?
01:26:16 Mr. Beton.
01:26:16 I was just gonna say Mr. Beton.
01:26:18 Mr. Beton.
01:26:19 Yeah, yeah.
01:26:21 Oh, I would say Christian Weston Chandler,
01:26:23 but he's back.
01:26:23 But his new stuff is sucks and is boring.
01:26:25 So as far as I'm concerned, Christian is dead.
01:26:28 What's he making now?
01:26:29 What's he doing?
01:26:29 He's still making comics, but they're stupid.
01:26:31 Like they're just like him,
01:26:33 him like sending a positive message about trans rights.
01:26:35 Snore.
01:26:37 Agreed.
01:26:38 Agreed.
01:26:38 Fucking Jan Rankowski or Parker91.
01:26:41 I'm fine with Parker91 over.
01:26:43 I'm fine with that.
01:26:44 Chapter might have been closed.
01:26:45 But his new channel, Wisdom Gun,
01:26:48 is fucking gone dude.
01:26:49 Like some sort of like drama that I don't fully understand.
01:26:51 I need to research this.
01:26:52 I'm so fucking upset.
01:26:54 Jan, please come back.
01:26:55 I love you with all my heart.
01:26:57 I love DIY high guy where you play the role of a CIA agent
01:27:02 trying to test out various different drugs.
01:27:04 I want that series back in my life.
01:27:07 DIY high guy.
01:27:08 Yeah.
01:27:08 That sounds good.
01:27:09 That sounds good.
01:27:10 Oh, did Shalegett like delete it?
01:27:12 Or was it to take it down for some reason?
01:27:13 No, no, no.
01:27:14 It's just like he's just not.
01:27:15 Okay.
01:27:16 He's just not there anymore for like some unfortunate reason.
01:27:20 Maybe he tried every drug
01:27:22 and there was nothing left to do.
01:27:23 Let's hope so.
01:27:24 I want to ask a two part question.
01:27:28 Mostly because the question itself is fascinating.
01:27:31 More so than whatever answer we could give.
01:27:33 It's from SquidMiku who asks,
01:27:36 Have you ever had a food phase?
01:27:38 For example, I ate nothing but SpaghettiOs for one year.
01:27:42 Also, what's something weird you like to eat?
01:27:45 For example, for me, it's yogurt sandwiches.
01:27:48 Oh my fucking god.
01:27:49 SquidMiku, you have a problem.
01:27:51 And it doesn't just stop at this question.
01:27:55 I got really into tea for a while there.
01:27:57 I was drinking a lot of weird teas.
01:27:59 I'm currently in my tea phase.
01:28:00 I'm surrounded right now by pure leaf unsweetened black tea bottles
01:28:04 just surrounding my complete naked facade right now.
01:28:07 Whatever you guys say tea
01:28:09 and then tell me that it's like store bought bottled tea,
01:28:11 I just throw up a little by now.
01:28:12 No, I'm talking about stuff that I got from like an herb shop
01:28:16 that I like to eat.
01:28:17 Good.
01:28:17 Good.
01:28:18 That's the good shit.
01:28:18 Yeah, I got some like fancy white tea
01:28:20 and was like way into like learning the exact temperature
01:28:23 it'll to brew it at and stuff.
01:28:24 Oh my god.
01:28:24 It was fun.
01:28:25 But I don't do it anymore because it's a hassle.
01:28:27 I didn't know that was an aspect that could.
01:28:27 And the reward is not worth it.
01:28:29 I didn't know that Beyblade customization
01:28:31 was the thing that you could do with tea
01:28:32 though I realized it's now obvious in retrospect.
01:28:35 I'm going to do that now.
01:28:36 It's going to be a new thing that I do.
01:28:37 Okay, I actually did.
01:28:38 For sophomore year of college,
01:28:40 I survived mostly on gigantic boxes of goldfish.
01:28:46 Gigantic boxes.
01:28:47 I mean bring them up to my roof.
01:28:48 I would not leave.
01:28:49 That's as bad as eating nothing but spaghetti for a year.
01:28:53 Yeah, it was terrible.
01:28:54 It was terrible.
01:28:55 I think that may be even worse.
01:28:56 And by the way, by the way much,
01:28:57 and literally I lived above the mess hall.
01:29:00 All I had to do was walk downstairs to free food all day
01:29:04 and eat it.
01:29:04 But I chose to stay in my room, play video games,
01:29:07 and eat fucking goldfish exclusively.
01:29:09 There was light.
01:29:11 I'm a monster.
01:29:12 It was a year after that I started working out and eating more.
01:29:14 So that was probably why.
01:29:15 When I first got in sixth grade,
01:29:17 which by the way my sixth grade year,
01:29:19 I started off the year like the last day of summer,
01:29:22 I watched the human history movies for the first time.
01:29:24 I believe that was the year at least.
01:29:26 Anyway, great year to start off.
01:29:29 For like the entire first half of the year,
01:29:32 like six months,
01:29:33 I ate nothing but bags of croutons.
01:29:37 Whoa, weird.
01:29:38 Like would you get them?
01:29:39 Where'd you get them?
01:29:40 I just went to Bons.
01:29:41 I went to Bons and I just had packets of croutons.
01:29:43 How did you live off of this?
01:29:45 Just croutons and goldfish in both of your cases.
01:29:48 Yeah, just carbs.
01:29:49 Simple carbs.
01:29:49 Yeah, that's it.
01:29:50 It's all you need, dude.
01:29:51 Don't you need like protein or something?
01:29:53 No.
01:29:54 Digi, look at me.
01:29:55 Look at me, Digi.
01:29:56 You think I need anything that's not carbs?
01:29:59 No, no, never.
01:30:00 Mochi's body consumes its own waste products
01:30:02 and recycles it.
01:30:03 I start to like,
01:30:05 I start to feel sick if I eat the same dish like twice in a day.
01:30:09 Like I feel gross and I need to go eat another thing.
01:30:12 You just got to delicate stuff there, Digi.
01:30:15 You got to hard the fuck up with the bombs dropped by Digi.
01:30:18 When World War III stops,
01:30:19 I'm only going to have packets of croutons
01:30:21 that's all I'm going to be able to assist off of.
01:30:22 Yeah, I'm only going to have fucking goldfish just to survive.
01:30:24 This is crazy.
01:30:25 Digi's just been spoiled by all that sweet Patreon money.
01:30:27 He can afford to buy something new all the time.
01:30:30 I can afford to buy a place in a day.
01:30:32 I'm a relatively picky eater, but like I won't, I don't know.
01:30:38 Like it has to be like a different,
01:30:41 like the other day I had a garbage plate
01:30:43 for that video I did about garbage plates
01:30:44 and like I ate until I was full
01:30:47 and then later I tried to eat more
01:30:48 and like even though it was delicious,
01:30:50 my stomach was like,
01:30:51 you need another kind of nutrient than this.
01:30:54 Like you can't keep eating this
01:30:56 because this will kill you.
01:30:57 Right.
01:30:57 You know, so go eat a different thing.
01:30:58 He has an acute case of rich person syndrome.
01:31:01 I guess so.
01:31:02 Well, maybe your body is like more attuned
01:31:05 to what it actually needs or something.
01:31:06 I don't know, people, it's bad that my body
01:31:09 like doesn't immediately punish me
01:31:11 for just eating goldfish for a fucking year.
01:31:14 I do have a habit where like if I like take some shitty food,
01:31:17 like I'll eat a ton of shitty food
01:31:18 and I'll eat it and I'll be full and disgusting
01:31:21 and I'll be like, oh God, that was so bad.
01:31:22 Like I'm so full of crap.
01:31:24 And then I'll be like, oh, I'm so full, I'm gonna die.
01:31:26 But then I'll be like, wait,
01:31:27 and I'll go and I'll eat an apple afterwards
01:31:29 and like think that it'll make me less full than no.
01:31:32 It just makes you more full.
01:31:34 It doesn't actually work to make you feel better.
01:31:36 I would say I've never been through a food phase
01:31:38 like what you guys are describing,
01:31:40 but like I've been through lots of like just,
01:31:44 what's the word for like all the foods you eat?
01:31:47 Like your diet, I guess?
01:31:49 Yeah, your diet, sure, sure.
01:31:51 I've been through like diet phases,
01:31:54 not like doing a diet, but like where every,
01:31:56 like I'm eating the same seven or eight things
01:31:59 and then it cycles into a different seven
01:32:01 or eight things at some point.
01:32:03 You know, so like it might,
01:32:04 and I'll have phases where like I got really
01:32:06 into spicy food for a while,
01:32:07 I was trying to eat like spicy shit all the time,
01:32:09 just like boost up my ability to eat spicy foods,
01:32:13 or I got like way into onions for a while,
01:32:15 but it was never to an extent
01:32:16 like just eating onions all the time.
01:32:18 It was just like, oh, maybe I'll get onions on my burger
01:32:22 every time I get a burger.
01:32:23 I did, when I was in California
01:32:26 and I was super poor and living for free
01:32:27 and some guys in my friend's side room,
01:32:29 I did have a phase of like,
01:32:31 I used to just eat tons of egg sandwiches
01:32:32 because eggs are really cheap and bread is really cheap.
01:32:34 I had a just, I would just fry eggs and put them on bread.
01:32:37 See, like I had a phase,
01:32:38 I had a phase of being way into egg salad sandwiches,
01:32:42 but I wouldn't say it was something I was eating all the time, you know.
01:32:46 I love egg salad, by the way.
01:32:48 Like I did have a phase where I would make myself
01:32:49 an egg salad sandwich probably every other day,
01:32:52 you know, for lunch, but it's not like all of us eating, you know.
01:32:56 Side note here, how awful is it
01:32:59 that we've let anime gone the better of us?
01:33:01 I mean, it didn't do a spicy bro pack to anime expo,
01:33:03 named Digi.
01:33:04 How fucking abysmal is that?
01:33:05 It was, we tried, but we had like some game with it.
01:33:06 What do you mean we tried, dude?
01:33:07 I was there too.
01:33:09 I said Nate.
01:33:10 Oh, you did?
01:33:11 Oh, okay, okay.
01:33:12 It's a shame, that needs to be,
01:33:14 Rycon 3 coming up real soon.
01:33:15 Part two of that question though,
01:33:17 did any of you have a weird thing you like to eat?
01:33:19 Like, I don't think any,
01:33:21 there's lots of stuff I would describe as like,
01:33:22 maybe not something everyone eats,
01:33:25 but nothing that's not considered a dish, you know.
01:33:28 Yeah, yeah.
01:33:28 I mean, I kind of eat, I mean, so like after,
01:33:32 okay, I mean.
01:33:33 There's even cans of beans, Nate,
01:33:34 even your cans of beans.
01:33:35 My famous patented dark red kidney bean cans,
01:33:38 which I love, and I'm ready to eat.
01:33:40 It's weird to eat as much of it as you eat,
01:33:42 but it's not weird to eat kidney beans.
01:33:44 Well, I wasn't even gonna bring that up.
01:33:45 By themselves, I would say that it is.
01:33:47 I mean, I eat them uncooked raw out of the can,
01:33:48 and I do wash them off, I wash up the goose.
01:33:50 Our example was yogurt sandwiches.
01:33:54 I don't have anything like that.
01:33:55 What I was gonna say was like,
01:33:57 I feel like this sort of counts,
01:33:58 so like after I work out,
01:34:00 I would normally consume like protein,
01:34:02 chocolate protein powers, just the kind I like,
01:34:04 and then I have, I got the stuff creatine,
01:34:06 which is, I don't know, it's famous and fitness stuff.
01:34:07 It helps you grow muscle,
01:34:09 but that's fruit punch flavor,
01:34:10 and I used to drink them one after each other,
01:34:12 and like that was like, oh, my stomach's full of water.
01:34:14 What am I gonna do?
01:34:15 Brilliant plan.
01:34:16 I literally combined them,
01:34:17 and I drink chocolate fruit powder,
01:34:19 fruit punch mixture, and it's really gross,
01:34:22 but I drink it anyway, because it's efficient.
01:34:24 I did for a while do a thing that I think was actually good,
01:34:27 and I don't understand why people thought this was weird,
01:34:29 because I think it just makes sense,
01:34:31 and it is tasty,
01:34:32 but I would make my morning coffee,
01:34:34 and then I would put a scoop of chocolate protein powder in it,
01:34:36 and blend it into like a protein mocha thing.
01:34:39 Dude, I tried to make a Ben Saint,
01:34:41 and it got all, I think my protein was too sticky.
01:34:43 That's not a Ben Saint, that's a Ben,
01:34:45 well, I won't say my real last name,
01:34:46 even though I don't care, and lots of people,
01:34:48 yeah, yeah, that's the Ben, my real name,
01:34:51 which I don't know why I'm being weird about it,
01:34:53 but now I've done it, and I'm gonna stick to the decision.
01:34:55 I like not saying my name on light, it's just fun.
01:34:57 It's fun for me.
01:34:58 The Ben Saint is, the Ben Saint is whole milk, ice, and cherry.
01:35:02 Ben Saint's not your real name?
01:35:05 Juice from a cherry, from a Maraschino cherry jar,
01:35:07 plus some cherries.
01:35:09 Wait a minute, that's your last name?
01:35:10 That's my last name.
01:35:12 Whoa, are we like related weird?
01:35:14 Impossible.
01:35:15 Wait, are you two keg and phantom horn from T-Pap?
01:35:18 I never knew.
01:35:19 Wait, you're saying that your real name,
01:35:21 your real name isn't Guy Saint?
01:35:22 What the?
01:35:23 My real name isn't Standard, after all, I betrayed you all.
01:35:26 Okay.
01:35:27 That's bizarre.
01:35:27 I, anyone else have an answer to this?
01:35:29 Yeah.
01:35:29 I wanna accuse Tom of having one.
01:35:32 Me?
01:35:33 Ooh, drama.
01:35:34 Drama, alright.
01:35:35 This isn't even something that's like weird to eat,
01:35:38 it's just weird to think about the existence of,
01:35:41 because Tom, I don't know if you still are,
01:35:42 but you were a vegetarian.
01:35:43 Are you still a vegetarian?
01:35:44 I still am, yes.
01:35:45 And you are big into Taco Bell,
01:35:48 because they will replace the meat with beans
01:35:51 on all of their stuff.
01:35:52 Yeah, okay.
01:35:53 Which to me has always been like,
01:35:54 why the fuck do you have to go to Taco Bell as a vet?
01:35:57 Just don't go to Taco Bell.
01:35:59 It makes sense to me.
01:36:01 Because Taco Bell's fucking great, I love fast food,
01:36:03 and Taco Bell's amazing.
01:36:06 Really eating, buddy.
01:36:07 You're just collab with Report of the Week, Tom,
01:36:09 in a big way.
01:36:09 All of us should all die.
01:36:10 I love Report of the Week.
01:36:12 Oh my god.
01:36:12 I love Report of the Week.
01:36:13 I've never heard of this.
01:36:15 Next piece of pee will be Report of the Week episode.
01:36:17 Yeah.
01:36:18 Him just like sitting there in his car,
01:36:19 in his like, in his three-piece suit,
01:36:21 with his fucking like,
01:36:22 fastidiously fastened tie and his little pocket kerchief,
01:36:26 just looking like a fucking,
01:36:27 looking like a some 20-year-old like,
01:36:28 Wall Street wannabe.
01:36:30 No, you look like a fucking 12-year-old, dude.
01:36:32 Yeah, yeah.
01:36:33 He's just terrified of his mind.
01:36:35 Same thing, same thing when you're ancient as the winds,
01:36:37 like me.
01:36:38 And just sitting there like,
01:36:39 like bringing out, bringing out a little,
01:36:41 a little packet of like,
01:36:43 fucking a Burger King, like Cheetos,
01:36:45 like Cheetos curly fries,
01:36:47 and just being like, and talking at length,
01:36:50 talking at length about like,
01:36:51 the merits of these Cheetos curly fries.
01:36:52 I've actually already done this back in,
01:36:54 back in my youth.
01:36:56 I had, I had a YouTube channel with my friend,
01:36:58 we reviewed fast food,
01:36:59 and we would record,
01:37:00 we would record in the store,
01:37:02 we brought the camera in.
01:37:03 What if, what if this friend was right?
01:37:05 What if this friend was right?
01:37:07 Is it possible?
01:37:08 Is it possible?
01:37:09 The best thing about Tom's show
01:37:10 is that they did it in the restaurant,
01:37:12 like they would sneak a camera in,
01:37:13 which was so much cooler than any of the other ones
01:37:16 that do it in like their car,
01:37:17 like game drops.
01:37:18 The couple times that we, we did it at home,
01:37:20 we would always drink Mountain Dew out of wine glasses.
01:37:24 Sick.
01:37:24 And I tried to copy your show, Tom.
01:37:27 I tried to do the, the go into a place.
01:37:31 I had like several ideas for fast food review shows,
01:37:34 but one of them, me and my brother Shade,
01:37:37 were just like recording a random podcast one time.
01:37:39 This never saw the light of day,
01:37:40 because it was terrible.
01:37:42 But I had, I was holding the laptop
01:37:45 with my fucking preamp plugged into it,
01:37:47 sitting on top of the laptop,
01:37:49 and I was holding the microphone,
01:37:50 like XLR cord and everything,
01:37:52 and just like walking to Taco Bell.
01:37:54 Like we walked to Taco Bell over recording the podcast
01:37:57 while walking on the side of the road.
01:37:58 Then we walked in and I had Shade hold the laptop
01:38:00 and everything while I ordered,
01:38:01 and like everyone's giving us looks like,
01:38:04 what in the flying fuck do you think you're doing, you know?
01:38:07 So we sit down to start eating,
01:38:09 just having the microphone going,
01:38:11 and the manager comes out and he's like,
01:38:14 yeah, you can't record in here.
01:38:15 Can you like, and he made me,
01:38:17 he made me delete the recording in front of him.
01:38:20 But of course, what?
01:38:22 But of course, he doesn't know
01:38:23 that all you have to do is hit the X
01:38:25 on audio track and audacity,
01:38:26 and I went, it's done.
01:38:27 And then of course as soon as it left,
01:38:28 I controlled Zed and it was back.
01:38:30 So, but it was a totally worthless recording anyways.
01:38:34 So, I'm glad.
01:38:35 We only got kicked out once, and I was at a KFC.
01:38:39 But on the rest of the time, we just,
01:38:43 we had free reign, we could do whatever we wanted.
01:38:44 Nobody really cared.
01:38:46 That's amazing.
01:38:48 Unfortunately, you've never had
01:38:50 another fast food review podcast
01:38:53 in your entire life, did you?
01:38:54 And you've been yearning for that in your entire life.
01:38:56 The only intent, no, I've had a bunch,
01:38:59 but there's one that's currently running.
01:39:02 I say that, but there hasn't been an episode in months.
01:39:05 I have fucking cried.
01:39:06 Even though there's generations of past.
01:39:08 Two of them have been recorded.
01:39:11 The people cry out.
01:39:13 It's true, it's true, it's unfortunate.
01:39:15 Once a month, May looks at me and goes like,
01:39:17 what the fuck is up with the fucking stealing your dad's?
01:39:20 I'm like, I don't know, man, I don't know.
01:39:23 Munchie's a busy boy, a busy boy.
01:39:25 It'll happen, it'll happen.
01:39:27 All right, one more question that I want to...
01:39:29 Wait, let me read this meme one.
01:39:31 This isn't a real question.
01:39:32 It's just like, at Mark McAuley on Twitter asks,
01:39:35 found out I'm at the same uni Gibbon attended.
01:39:38 How cucked am I doing an animation degree?
01:39:40 And then in parenthesis, he says,
01:39:42 I recognized his animation in a show reel.
01:39:44 First of all, cool, that's dope, dude.
01:39:47 And I would like to say that second of all,
01:39:49 Gib currently this month is working real hard
01:39:52 on various gigs he's gotten through his efforts
01:39:55 in animation shit, one of which is a commercial project.
01:39:58 He's animating a whole fucking thing for a dude.
01:40:00 So I'd say you're not completely fucked.
01:40:02 I think he's writing for it.
01:40:03 Well, there's that thing he's working with a company on,
01:40:05 and then there's one guy he's just animating for.
01:40:07 Yeah, yeah, so you're not totally fucked.
01:40:09 A documentary or something like that.
01:40:11 Oh, indeed.
01:40:12 And I want to say that he goes into this on his Patreon's only podcast.
01:40:19 Are you a patron of Gib?
01:40:21 I am, actually.
01:40:22 Shit, I want to hear that shit.
01:40:25 Incidentally, I'm sure he would just link it to you if you asked.
01:40:29 I will ask you.
01:40:30 I've always been waiting for one of my friends
01:40:32 to be interested enough in my Patreon exclusive content
01:40:35 to ask me for it, but nobody is.
01:40:36 It has never happened.
01:40:40 There's too fucking much to do, bro, dude, I'm sorry.
01:40:41 We're past the saturation point, it's true.
01:40:44 But the Patreon podcast might be more up you guys' alley
01:40:48 than a lot of the main...
01:40:50 Here's the thing, Digi.
01:40:51 We have exclusive access to your best friend's content,
01:40:55 which nobody else has, because you don't have to pay shit for it.
01:40:58 Oh, that's cute.
01:40:59 Also, Digi, the snippets you've released of your podcast
01:41:02 have been pretty interesting, so I actually would like to listen to those.
01:41:04 There was at least one or two that I specifically wanted to send you, Nate.
01:41:07 Oh, yeah?
01:41:08 There's even one where I talk about you,
01:41:10 and probably for some reason...
01:41:11 I wouldn't hear that.
01:41:12 ...a utilitarian reason or something.
01:41:14 Now I'm interested.
01:41:14 For drama reasons.
01:41:16 Anyway...
01:41:17 That's where he announces that he's leaving the PCP joint
01:41:19 and then the pizza party pod.
01:41:22 It was a ruse all along to pay it out the unbelievers.
01:41:25 Okay, all right.
01:41:26 I really do regret having brought that to fruition,
01:41:28 because I know it's gonna be a thing now.
01:41:31 We'll see how it goes.
01:41:31 All right.
01:41:32 This is what I always wanted, dude.
01:41:33 This is what I always wanted for us.
01:41:35 It's so worth it, though, because if there's one podcast,
01:41:38 I'd love for us to have a thing that's gonna be available.
01:41:40 We need a battle.
01:41:40 These fucking Rowdy fuckers' cop killers
01:41:42 are a negative influence on the PCP,
01:41:44 and we need to obliterate it.
01:41:46 No, we need this.
01:41:47 What is Sparkoil's undigisoul?
01:41:49 What is Superman without Lex Luthor?
01:41:51 You're so right.
01:41:52 He needs an enemy.
01:41:53 We need our nemesis within, of course.
01:41:55 Of course, yes.
01:41:56 All right, all right.
01:41:57 Okay, Digi, listen.
01:41:58 Visuals asks,
01:42:00 if there was one piece of content you wish you never made,
01:42:04 what would it be?
01:42:05 It's easy.
01:42:06 It's easy.
01:42:06 Analyze this, Anarchy.
01:42:08 Analyze this, Anarchy.
01:42:09 I want to kill myself every time I think about it.
01:42:10 Also, to remind everyone,
01:42:12 I read the script and turned that down.
01:42:14 I am literally 1,000 times smarter than Ben Superior
01:42:16 in every way.
01:42:17 I know things.
01:42:18 Really?
01:42:18 There you go.
01:42:19 Fucked up, and it makes me mad.
01:42:23 I don't know.
01:42:24 Everything I've done is fucking flawless.
01:42:25 I'll think.
01:42:26 Go on, Digi.
01:42:26 I think I, on some level,
01:42:28 I don't know if I would have regretted this at the time,
01:42:32 but by this point,
01:42:33 I can't remember anything good
01:42:34 having come from my most boring taste in anime video.
01:42:38 Like, I feel like the point was mostly missed,
01:42:42 and that even the people who did get the point,
01:42:44 it didn't do anything to have gotten the point.
01:42:47 All it did was ruin 3x3 threads on 4chan forever,
01:42:52 which is actually great.
01:42:53 I'm actually very happy with that result.
01:42:55 But it also meant that I am forever inundated
01:42:57 with people's 3x3s,
01:42:59 and I don't care and have never cared.
01:43:05 That's probably the video that had the worst consequences,
01:43:08 and the worst cost benefit.
01:43:11 Like, it had more cost than benefit to have made.
01:43:14 I don't know why it became such a big deal in the first place,
01:43:16 because it was,
01:43:17 I shouldn't have given it a thumbnail,
01:43:20 like, I give my video thumbnails
01:43:22 when I think they can become big,
01:43:24 and in that case, I was like,
01:43:25 oh, this is a chance to be a big video,
01:43:27 but I should have realized that I didn't want it to be a big video,
01:43:30 and I fucked up by letting it become one.
01:43:33 So.
01:43:33 I have one.
01:43:35 I have one.
01:43:36 Even though I'm happy with it now,
01:43:37 and I don't think it's bad,
01:43:39 in hindsight, I do wish that I didn't do Nuzlocke Conquest,
01:43:42 because it ended up being way more work
01:43:45 than it was actually worth.
01:43:47 But, you know, like, yeah.
01:43:50 I kind of wish I had stopped after the first one.
01:43:51 Nuzlocke Conquest should have just been made six months later
01:43:55 after the champion was done,
01:43:58 and then it would have made tabs.
01:43:59 Yeah, it really should have,
01:44:01 and it was foolish of me to want to jump right into it,
01:44:03 just to coincide with the release of Sun and Moon.
01:44:06 Because, like, it's a long-form series
01:44:08 that came out over months.
01:44:09 It's not like it was one big explosive thing
01:44:11 that was like, oh, everyone who's hyped about Sun and Moon
01:44:13 is going to want to watch this, you know?
01:44:15 Right, right.
01:44:15 I mean, it was a bit ill-conceived.
01:44:17 In terms of marketing and, again, cost-to-benefit ratio stuff,
01:44:21 like, yeah, it did succeed.
01:44:22 Even though it's cool and people like it,
01:44:24 like, it really did not do much of anything for me.
01:44:27 I am, canonically, the biggest Nuzlocke Conquest fan,
01:44:30 and I absolutely loved it, but that's what that just means.
01:44:33 I mean, I like it.
01:44:34 But that doesn't help you.
01:44:34 That doesn't help you.
01:44:35 No, not at all.
01:44:38 I don't know.
01:44:38 I guess I'll just use my old answer of, like,
01:44:40 I worked way too long.
01:44:42 All my old videos, I worked way too long on.
01:44:45 The Lucifer and the Biscayne number one
01:44:47 is, like, over-edited to the point of being
01:44:48 almost, like, indecipherable to some extent.
01:44:51 And the Undertale one is kind of like the two,
01:44:53 but that has positives as well.
01:44:55 Nothing I've made is, like, terrible,
01:44:57 but I guess I would just say, like, the Lucifer,
01:44:58 because I worked too hard on it.
01:44:59 But I am happy with what it is now, so I don't know.
01:45:02 That's all I got.
01:45:03 Tom, you got any videos you regret making?
01:45:07 I probably should have done the leaving the fandom one better
01:45:09 because it cost me, literally, all my money.
01:45:11 But at the same time, it, like, set me on the path to making it.
01:45:14 But what's that black money that was illicit money anyway?
01:45:17 That's my whole point.
01:45:18 It set me on the path to doing things that actually matter.
01:45:21 So, like, I set out to make it because I wanted to do a hard,
01:45:25 like, get out so I couldn't go back,
01:45:27 because I knew I would just crawl back if I didn't.
01:45:29 You succeeded there.
01:45:30 I'm glad that happened, but at the same time,
01:45:32 I'm perpetually broke forever now,
01:45:33 and I'll probably never make money again, so.
01:45:37 Unless I start some drama.
01:45:38 So, that's kind of why I'm always on the show.
01:45:40 Start some drama.
01:45:41 I'm really poor.
01:45:42 I could probably make some money with some drama.
01:45:44 That's what we're all counting on.
01:45:45 Give me money, guys.
01:45:46 Don't make me start shit.
01:45:46 The only way that it's going to work is if we are very careful
01:45:49 to make ourselves not the bad guys in that drama,
01:45:52 which is going to be difficult, you know?
01:45:54 But we can manage.
01:45:55 We can do it, though.
01:45:55 I'm confident.
01:45:56 We have the skills.
01:45:58 The video I most regret in my entire life
01:46:01 is not on any YouTube channel that I currently have access to.
01:46:04 I've completely forgot the password for it.
01:46:06 But I believe sometime around second or third grade,
01:46:08 I made a YouTube video, right?
01:46:10 Accidentally flipped off my grandmother,
01:46:11 and I got really sad.
01:46:13 I didn't.
01:46:13 I apologize.
01:46:14 I obviously bad it.
01:46:16 You accidentally flipped her off.
01:46:18 Absolutely intentional.
01:46:19 I was trying to give her a thumbs up,
01:46:20 but my brain forgot how to make the thumbs-up motion.
01:46:23 I flipped her off instead.
01:46:24 Well, the old bitch probably deserved it.
01:46:26 Yeah, she did, if I'm honest with myself.
01:46:31 Okay, I guess that's all our questions.
01:46:34 That's it, everybody.

01:47:11 Yeah, and I got drunk, and DeVoo got shit-faced,

01:47:48 Oh man, someone finally tweeted a picture of himself
01:47:50 wearing the sick PCP shirts that I designed,
01:47:52 and I'm so proud of myself.
01:47:53 It looks so great.
01:47:54 Did you see that?
01:47:55 I did see that.
01:47:56 It looked incredible on a shirt.
01:47:59 It looked pretty good.
01:48:00 It looks pretty good.
01:48:01 Yeah, it's hard to believe.
01:48:02 I was like, I was so glad to see that.
01:48:05 Good work, Ed.
01:48:05 Incredible.
01:48:06 I think that's all we had to say on the subject
01:48:08 of our favorite subject in the entire world, ourselves.
01:48:12 Bye!
01:48:13 Bye!
01:48:17 Yeah.
01:48:17 Bitch.
01:48:18 Yeah.
01:48:19 Yeah.
01:48:20 Yeah.
01:48:21 Yeah.
01:48:51 Ed, I don't want to do it.
