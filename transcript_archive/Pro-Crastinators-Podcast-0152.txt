00:00:00 One more time. One, two, three, bang!
00:00:30 That seems very wrong.
00:00:32 It would be even funnier if we did take the offer and did we have to shelter both?
00:00:38 Okay, well that will be hilarious, but let's start.
00:00:42 This bang issue is going to be what finally tears this apart. We knew it was going to be something.
00:00:48 Is this the cold open arc of the PCP?
00:00:51 God, I wish it is. I hate interest. I hate them just in concept.
00:00:54 I just want to hit the ground fucking running.
00:00:57 I really like the cold open last time.
00:01:00 They're just great. There were positives and negatives.
00:01:05 There were no negatives.
00:01:07 Do you mind if I animate during this podcast?
00:01:10 You know what? I'm going to take this time to rail against our audience
00:01:16 and call out the literal cowards in the comments who were like,
00:01:19 did you guys not mean to keep the first part in?
00:01:22 I literally can't believe they were saying that.
00:01:25 Fuck off. Die.
00:01:27 Okay? We're bringing you the real shit.
00:01:30 We're bringing you the raw shit.
00:01:32 We're toppling Nate's totalitarian regime where there's format or structure
00:01:39 or anything makes sense or means anything.
00:01:41 This is a new era.
00:01:43 We clearly state in the clip that we were putting it in the beginning.
00:01:47 Do you think that we just forgot?
00:01:50 We just left in the entire intro and we didn't realize?
00:01:54 Here's my theory.
00:01:56 I don't mind saying if it was me editing, I would have cut that out
00:02:00 and been like, nah, this doesn't need to be an end.
00:02:02 This is it. This is why. This is why.
00:02:04 We need an end. We need an end to Nate.
00:02:07 If only. There was some way to avoid Nate's crushing iron will on everyone
00:02:12 involvement in the PCP.
00:02:14 Only. Editors had any autonomy whatsoever in what they do.
00:02:18 If only. We had any power to loosen his iron grip.
00:02:22 I'm gonna start drinking bang so you can reverse that mental retardation.
00:02:26 I need to start chugging it by the barrel full.
00:02:28 Hey everybody. Welcome to the procrastinator's podcast.
00:02:32 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:02:34 Today with me is Hippo Crit.
00:02:36 Hey.
00:02:37 Uh, Mage.
00:02:39 Stop. Don't do it.
00:02:41 It's a very soft coffee. I like it.
00:02:43 Don't give in.
00:02:44 Nate's here.
00:02:45 That's true.
00:02:46 Don't agree.
00:02:47 Munchies around.
00:02:48 I can't.
00:02:49 You've got soft coffee. I got a soft talk.
00:02:51 You've never been aroused, never been aroused.
00:02:53 And you're playing their game.
00:02:54 And last but not least.
00:02:56 La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
00:03:00 Everybody.
00:03:02 Wonderboy.
00:03:04 You know, why would you just have...
00:03:06 Dancane is here.
00:03:10 Why don't we just have intros? I feel like we don't even need the pockets.
00:03:13 If we just repeat the intros over and over, that'll be our best material.
00:03:16 Well, I still want to one day do the, what's it like, algorithmically generated PCP podcast via bots.
00:03:22 That'll be good. That'll be good.
00:03:24 How would that go?
00:03:25 Yeah, how would you...
00:03:26 Are you talking about like an actual bot to do that?
00:03:28 I mean, oh well, okay, so theoretically you could take, you could like program a bot to have like certain topics that it brings up.
00:03:34 And you know, it would speak in Robo voice.
00:03:36 Maybe we could work on that and tweak it and send more like us.
00:03:39 But if you just have, you know, I'm sure there's a formula you could follow.
00:03:42 Okay, what if we had like a text to speech?
00:03:44 Like we each took our own audio for maybe like a couple of episodes, just our own audio.
00:03:49 Put it in like a text to speech reader and then just like read the script.
00:03:54 No, no, no, no, we took that.
00:03:56 Yeah, put that into like a procedural text generator.
00:03:59 Generated like, you know, a bunch of shit and just read it and like took turns or something.
00:04:05 You know what Ben?
00:04:07 That sounds like it would be a great idea, Ben.
00:04:11 It reminds me of an episode of Star Trek that I saw.
00:04:15 By the way guys, have you played the new Pokemon game?
00:04:19 No.
00:04:20 The new Pokemon game was a lot of fun.
00:04:22 It's already happening.
00:04:23 Do you guys want to join the Yang gang with me?
00:04:26 No, it's terrible.
00:04:28 You know that Burger King Footlettus guy was not a bot?
00:04:30 It's just a guy with a weird voice.
00:04:32 But I think it would be way less go here than that.
00:04:35 I watched Chills all the fucking time.
00:04:38 I'm a Chills aficionado.
00:04:40 Listen, yeah, Burger King Footlettus is funny, but he is so much more than meets Leigh Ai.
00:04:48 He is a fucking true American hero.
00:04:51 Every video, he is so not confident about the videos he's picked.
00:04:57 Every single like top 10 scariest video YouTubers who have avoided calamity.
00:05:03 He was like two children are in the woods.
00:05:06 Unfortunately, I do not think this video is real, but who knows?
00:05:11 Number nine.
00:05:12 Whoa.
00:05:13 Yeah, that's good.
00:05:14 That's a good impression.
00:05:15 Thank you.
00:05:16 It's a fascinating cadence he has to his voice.
00:05:18 I love it.
00:05:19 It's so fun.
00:05:20 It's so fun to say.
00:05:22 He's a real man.
00:05:24 He has genuine fears and wants in life.
00:05:28 There's one top 10.
00:05:32 I believe it's something like videos of people who have nearly avoided disaster.
00:05:37 Every single video is about people who have nearly avoided disaster.
00:05:41 It's this dude.
00:05:45 There's a video of this guy driving through the rain.
00:05:48 His voiceover, something in effect of like, watch as the rain pours on the windshield of this tired Nebraska male.
00:05:57 He is driving frantically.
00:05:59 The road has low friction and it is hard to control.
00:06:03 And then he just builds up this image of this poor, disheveled man trying to race home for whatever reason.
00:06:08 And then like, the quote unquote disaster that he nearly avoids is nothing.
00:06:14 It just is the entirety of the video, which is the disaster.
00:06:18 I'm going to be a little pro audience here because I haven't heard of this.
00:06:22 I know.
00:06:23 So clarify, so this is a YouTuber who people thought was like a voice bot?
00:06:28 Like an algorithmic voice bot?
00:06:31 It's just a YouTuber has a very, very, very interesting voice.
00:06:36 A very strange voice.
00:06:37 And his name is Chills, did you say Chills?
00:06:39 Chills, Chills.
00:06:40 He's a rapper.
00:06:41 He's a rapper.
00:06:42 No, no, man.
00:06:43 I had to finish this fucking video.
00:06:45 I thought you were finished.
00:06:46 No, no, no, no, no.
00:06:48 So he's building up the picture of this guy frantically driving through the rain in his typical Chills fashion.
00:06:55 And then once he gets to the end and supposedly something dangerous was supposed to be witnessed,
00:07:01 we were supposed to see something that was supposed to lead to his doom, which didn't happen.
00:07:07 He just says that he threw in this video.
00:07:09 He's such an affinity for firefighters and he wants to give a shout out to all the medical drivers of America
00:07:16 who have to drive through the dense rains.
00:07:19 Was this guy a medical driver in the video?
00:07:22 I don't know, maybe.
00:07:24 The point is, is that he just loves, he just loves like EMT members.
00:07:29 That's bad conveyance.
00:07:30 He just loves people in ambulances so much.
00:07:33 He wanted to be one of them as a kid.
00:07:35 You get really sensitive.
00:07:36 You get really sensitive.
00:07:37 I appreciate the sentiment.
00:07:38 You get him.
00:07:39 You really feel more connected to Chills.
00:07:40 When I was a kid, I wanted to work at a lemonade stand.
00:07:44 Did you do it?
00:07:46 That's the perfect time to do that.
00:07:47 I just couldn't hack it.
00:07:51 The state didn't just give Ben his lemonade stand.
00:07:53 What was he supposed to do about that?
00:07:55 What was I supposed to do about that?
00:07:57 A crew capital and invest in a small business?
00:08:00 No, it doesn't sound realistic.
00:08:02 It just doesn't sound like a thing people do.
00:08:05 Speaking of accruing mass sums of capital.
00:08:07 No, no, no.
00:08:08 Mage was going to speak.
00:08:09 Since we're talking about YouTubers with funny voices or shticks or whatever.
00:08:15 This is one YouTuber I really like.
00:08:17 He on purpose talks very, very slowly in a monotone and people give him shit for it.
00:08:24 But as if they don't realize that he's doing it on purpose and it's so funny to me that they...
00:08:30 Who?
00:08:31 What's the kind of concept?
00:08:32 Name names.
00:08:33 The YouTube is Daft Pina, like Daft Punk, but Daft Pina.
00:08:38 He's a good boy. He's a good person.
00:08:41 I talked to him.
00:08:43 I used to talk to him.
00:08:45 It's not like I do it daily.
00:08:47 Is he a possible political connection that can help me in my quest?
00:08:51 Could he be of use to the Yang Gang?
00:08:53 That's all we need to know.
00:08:54 Could he be of use to us?
00:08:55 Oh, he already has over 100k subscribers.
00:08:58 Okay, there you go.
00:08:59 Let's get him on here.
00:09:01 That's a straight up social media influencer, right?
00:09:03 I'm not sure if he would want us as his associates.
00:09:07 No, don't say that.
00:09:09 I don't know. I'm not proud of you guys.
00:09:12 That's the meanest thing anyone's ever said.
00:09:17 Okay, he's leaving.
00:09:19 I don't know if he doesn't want to associate.
00:09:22 I understand. I get it.
00:09:24 You're not proud of us.
00:09:27 That's a step forward.
00:09:30 That's a step way forward.
00:09:32 That's a leap.
00:09:33 I can't believe it.
00:09:34 Man, I'm proud of you.
00:09:36 Why do you need to rectify this?
00:09:37 Well, whenever we're done reeling from this revelation...
00:09:42 Actually, is anybody proud of the PCP?
00:09:46 I have to wonder.
00:09:47 Because Mage isn't proud of it.
00:09:49 Jesse hadn't even told his friends he had a podcast for three years.
00:09:53 And Tom got banned from Mastodon because of his association with us.
00:09:57 I am still...
00:09:58 That was pretty crazy.
00:09:59 I don't understand what that was about.
00:10:02 Did you hear what happened?
00:10:03 Basically, Tom got banned from this social media platform called Mastodon.
00:10:08 Not quite. From a group on the platform, not the whole thing.
00:10:10 Right. Well, because Mastodon exists in instances.
00:10:13 Like Discord?
00:10:15 Yeah, kind of like Discord, except it's not...
00:10:17 It's like random what instance you're in, I guess.
00:10:20 I don't know.
00:10:21 I was confused about it when he...
00:10:23 Like an MMO server?
00:10:24 I thought it was like a Twitter-esque sort of thing.
00:10:28 It is. It functions like Twitter, but it is an instanced site.
00:10:32 So, there's like different mods that moderate like 100 person groups of it.
00:10:38 And the mod of his instance was not happy with the things he was tweeting.
00:10:43 It's like Discord?
00:10:45 If the actual texting and messaging of Discord was like Twitter,
00:10:49 but the Discord servers, you had a new account for each one of them.
00:10:52 So, you didn't have one account with a ton of servers.
00:10:54 It was just for each server you were in.
00:10:56 That was a new account that you had.
00:10:58 And that account that he had in that server was deleted.
00:11:01 Yeah, okay.
00:11:03 I mean, people should...
00:11:04 We should link this in the show notes for the specific tweet.
00:11:06 And it was because of us.
00:11:08 Well, it was a number of things.
00:11:12 First of all, it happened because he had made a tweet talking about how...
00:11:16 You mean a mastodon?
00:11:18 A mastodon, sure.
00:11:20 Well, the thing is that everything he posts on mastodon is just a tweet.
00:11:24 He just has a program that posts the same thing everywhere.
00:11:27 So, it was a tweet.
00:11:30 But he had tweeted out that, like in America,
00:11:34 their handling of Michael Jackson was this new documentary that is of questionable veracity.
00:11:40 Whereas in Japan, they are still celebrating Michael Jackson
00:11:44 by having a huge reference to him in the New Devil May Cry game,
00:11:46 which he had posted a screencap of.
00:11:48 The moderator claimed that he was being insensitive to victims.
00:11:53 Yeah.
00:11:54 That Tom was?
00:11:55 Yes, that Tom was being insensitive to victims.
00:11:58 Yeah, I hated that because, like...
00:12:01 I mean, the whole idea of...
00:12:03 Tom is defending the only victim who's fucking in the case!
00:12:06 Well, yeah, that's the thing.
00:12:08 It's not even like Tom hates the victims,
00:12:10 because Tom doesn't believe that there are victims.
00:12:13 It would be very different if, like, fuck the people that Michael Jackson,
00:12:17 I believe, did rape or whatever.
00:12:19 But he doesn't believe that Michael Jackson did that.
00:12:21 First of all, Tom is not making a political stance with that comment.
00:12:24 He is making an observation on the different, you know,
00:12:27 like, reaction to the character of Michael Jackson by different populaces.
00:12:31 So he is not making a stance.
00:12:33 He's making a joke, I mean, obviously.
00:12:35 But I suppose the most negative interpretation of that, you could say, is,
00:12:39 oh, look at him highlighting.
00:12:41 He's choosing to highlight Japan's, I don't know, less interested,
00:12:44 or perhaps skeptical reaction to accusations made.
00:12:48 Therefore, evil, I don't know, right wing...
00:12:51 Maybe in their eyes, Tom is like the Holocaust denier of the Michael Jackson variety.
00:12:56 Well, you got to understand the way that things are right now,
00:12:59 because this new Michael Jackson documentary came out,
00:13:02 and very much so, it's created, like, a whole new wave of people who are like,
00:13:06 oh, he was a monster.
00:13:08 And I think they probably did this to capitalize on the R. Kelly thing,
00:13:11 because R. Kelly had a big documentary come out that made everybody realize
00:13:14 he was way worse than they first thought.
00:13:17 I have mostly heard people...
00:13:19 Okay, I kind of...
00:13:21 This happens to me a lot.
00:13:23 Do you really hear about something by way of the backlash against it?
00:13:27 That's almost exclusively how I hear about anything.
00:13:30 Yeah, and I didn't know about this documentary until I heard people grumbling
00:13:35 that people are unfair to Michael Jackson, there's no real evidence against him.
00:13:39 Right.
00:13:40 And then I realized, like, oh, I guess the documentary just came out,
00:13:44 talking about what he's a bad man.
00:13:46 Well, because a lot of people believe that documentary,
00:13:49 that is probably the more, like, majority cultural-tied view of the situation.
00:13:54 I'm sure that this mod just straight-up believes it.
00:13:58 It doesn't even remotely think about the idea that somebody would think that it was just untrue.
00:14:05 To him, it's like Holocaust denial.
00:14:10 So, yeah, so they went to...
00:14:13 They already gave him a warning for that tweet.
00:14:15 Then they found out about a tweet that he had done just promoting the latest episode of PCP,
00:14:20 the podcast.
00:14:22 And I guess this mod actually went and listened to PCP.
00:14:25 Seemed like it, yeah.
00:14:27 And he said that there were a lot of...
00:14:29 What was it, homophobic and ableist slurs?
00:14:31 I believe so, yeah.
00:14:32 Funny.
00:14:33 Funny.
00:14:34 It had to be said.
00:14:35 You know, I mean, we fucking had the N-word dropped a bunch on recent episodes.
00:14:39 You'd think it would be for that.
00:14:41 Well, I mean, we all just, like, out of pocket say retarded constantly.
00:14:47 I guess that's true.
00:14:50 Maybe we should examine that.
00:14:55 I don't even think it was that Tom said it.
00:14:57 He just said that those things were said on the podcast that Tom associates with.
00:15:00 I believe that's correct, yeah.
00:15:02 Implying Tom talks on the PCP.
00:15:04 You know, and Tom was complicit by being on the episode, I suppose.
00:15:07 No, that's not fair.
00:15:08 That's not fair.
00:15:09 Just because you're in the same platform doesn't mean that you stand by the same...
00:15:13 Like, I mean, like, you and Ben.
00:15:15 You know, like, three episodes.
00:15:17 You've been disagreeing.
00:15:18 Well, Mange, I'm purely playing devil's advocate.
00:15:21 I'm not.
00:15:22 Like, for example, I think if you get like a...
00:15:26 Like, sorry, on MSNBC, which is like, they say it's liberal or whatever,
00:15:30 if you bring on like a conservative to like argue with him and you're a host,
00:15:34 then like, even though you're literally arguing against his point,
00:15:37 one could still make the argument that you're choosing to highlight him
00:15:40 and so you're like...
00:15:41 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're arguing.
00:15:42 I don't think so.
00:15:43 Very stupid.
00:15:44 If we were...
00:15:45 It's not stupid.
00:15:46 I don't think it's stupid.
00:15:47 Imagine we were a, like, fucking, I don't know, white supremacist podcast
00:15:51 and you posted...
00:15:52 A just caller?
00:15:53 Of course not, Ben.
00:15:54 Of course not.
00:15:55 And you posted a link to us.
00:15:57 I mean, that would be spreading our propaganda
00:16:00 and if someone was against that and doesn't think it should be spread,
00:16:03 like, fuck you, get off my platform, that makes sense.
00:16:06 Well, I mean, I think that's essentially what these mod thought was going on.
00:16:11 Ben, can you agree, though, that that is extremely cowardly
00:16:16 for this person to say that like, oh, he doesn't want us to spread our ideas,
00:16:20 but like, whether or not ideas are good or bad should be able to stand on their own.
00:16:24 Like, it's up to everybody to determine if what they're listening to is good or bad.
00:16:29 You know, I struggle with this.
00:16:30 I struggle with this a lot, because like, on the one hand,
00:16:34 I do believe people should be able to say whatever they believe and think what they think.
00:16:40 And, but what if an idea gets people hurt just by its very spread?
00:16:48 And what if it's dangerous?
00:16:49 Then we need to learn lessons from it.
00:16:51 Well, I mean, so like, I've heard discussions about this.
00:16:54 One example is like, let's just say, like, the knowledge of how to create a virus
00:16:59 that would wipe out humanity.
00:17:01 I mean, I think most people would agree.
00:17:03 It's reasonable to suppress that particular piece of information,
00:17:07 because it's purely, you know, would be purely destructive
00:17:10 and no good would come from its existence or people's awareness.
00:17:13 So, okay, so if you accept that, so now there is literally some information
00:17:18 that just should be basically banned and not accessible.
00:17:21 So where, then we have to discuss where the line needs to be drawn.
00:17:26 Maybe, you know, only things that are directly like that should be straight up removed.
00:17:30 But like, in the wake of all the New Zealand shit, they've blocked 4chan and 8chan access in the whole country.
00:17:36 I think specifically, I don't think it was the country, I think it was the ISPs,
00:17:41 the private corporate interests who chose to, and the thing is we can't stop them.
00:17:46 Let me make a cut and dry sort of theoretical kind of a thought experiment, I guess.
00:17:53 If we all agreed that an idea spread harm and hurt people by its very spread
00:17:59 and like by people's very belief in it, like just by talking about it,
00:18:04 it would result in bad things and people being hurt unfairly.
00:18:08 Would we agree that we should stop the spread of it and not let people advocate it and say it?
00:18:14 You know, there's something to be said for the idea of like,
00:18:17 what do they say, sunlight's the best disinfectant.
00:18:19 So I wouldn't even necessarily say every time that it's best to like, surprise that kind of information.
00:18:24 I want personally all the information that exists.
00:18:28 I want to be on the same playing field as everybody else.
00:18:30 I don't want anybody to have information that I have no access to.
00:18:34 My dude, New Zealand is straight up criminalized having the manifesto from the New Zealand shooter.
00:18:40 It's a crime to have manifesto.
00:18:42 It's fucking ridiculous.
00:18:43 That is fucking insanity.
00:18:45 We can learn a lot from this manifesto that's retarded.
00:18:50 Yeah, like for example, all the ways that he's, you know, wrong and I disagree with his conclusions.
00:18:56 Exactly.
00:18:57 But not everyone's gonna read, just mathematically, not everyone's gonna read that manifesto and think wrong.
00:19:04 You know what I mean?
00:19:05 Well, okay, that's a good question.
00:19:07 And it comes down to...
00:19:08 No, no, I don't like this because like what you guys are teetering on is like policing of opinions.
00:19:14 Well, that's exactly what it's teetering on.
00:19:16 Yeah, but like who decides what's good and what's bad, you know?
00:19:19 Like imagine now like a lot of people are saying like, you know, like these opinions are bad,
00:19:26 therefore we have to silence these people.
00:19:28 But like they might be wrong, you know?
00:19:31 I mean, these are the sort of argument that comes up.
00:19:34 Like just for one example, if you've got like, you know, super right wing, like, excuse me,
00:19:39 sorry, something about that.
00:19:40 Like religious people, like for example, some of those people might not accept the fact that like,
00:19:45 for example, transgenderism is real.
00:19:47 And so, okay, that's their opinion.
00:19:49 And now, but you could certainly see why some people would say that this opinion is harmful and toxic.
00:19:55 Yeah.
00:19:56 So you just end up in a situation where those people...
00:19:58 I personally think the best course of action is to have these people and debate them
00:20:04 and then like point out all the ways they're wrong.
00:20:07 No, no, no, listen, you're not going to change their minds because their minds are already made.
00:20:11 You're debating them to change the minds of the people who are listening.
00:20:14 You allow people to decide themselves what's right and wrong.
00:20:18 You don't police them.
00:20:19 You don't force them to think the right way.
00:20:21 I don't agree with forcing people to think of one way or another.
00:20:24 I think that that is a very optimistic way to look at things.
00:20:30 No, I think that is the pessimistic way to look at it.
00:20:33 Wait, let me finish, let me finish.
00:20:35 I think that's optimistic because I think that's assuming people are creatures of rationality
00:20:39 and that when two ideas clash in the public free exchange that like the better one will win out
00:20:45 and I don't think that's true necessarily.
00:20:48 I don't think this is the best course of action, but I prefer this to policing thoughts
00:20:53 because I don't want people telling me what to think or what to make of this.
00:20:56 I don't want people to tell me that.
00:20:58 To be fair, mage, isn't that you simply prioritizing freedom
00:21:01 at potentially the expense of harm or safety, which I don't even disagree with.
00:21:06 I'm just saying that you're using your preferences there to dictate.
00:21:09 You just said you don't necessarily think it's the best course of action.
00:21:12 The reason that this freedom is so necessary is that nobody can determine what is the best for humanity.
00:21:21 For all we know, it could be possible that leaving anyone outside of my particular religion,
00:21:28 whatever that may be, alive, will damn me to hell.
00:21:32 That's possible.
00:21:34 Who's to say that murdering everyone outside of my religion is not in fact the best way forward
00:21:39 for a humanity of whoever's left afterwards?
00:21:42 We have no way of knowing that.
00:21:44 There's no objective standard of which ideas are right necessarily.
00:21:50 We do have to decide that.
00:21:53 Harmony is decided by society as time goes.
00:21:59 It's shifting. There's not a constant agreement.
00:22:02 That's why I want all the info, because it's always going to be changing.
00:22:07 If we said that this piece of information absolutely needs to be unlocked down,
00:22:13 For how long? From whom?
00:22:15 Is this information going to be handed down?
00:22:18 Are we going to form a fucking Templar society to protect this knowledge for the next 2,000 years?
00:22:24 The info is going to get out there.
00:22:26 I want to apologize. I'm going to do it, guys.
00:22:31 I'm going to say the N-word.
00:22:33 I'm going to Godwin's Law this conversation.
00:22:36 The N-word is Nazi.
00:22:38 And I'm going to say that is that attitude not the sort of thing that leads to the rise?
00:22:42 You fucking nigger.
00:22:44 Shut up.
00:22:46 God, we got to stop. I don't like it.
00:22:48 I don't fucking like.
00:22:49 Oh yeah, we're that podcast that says the N-word.
00:22:51 I don't want to be that podcast.
00:22:53 What about being the podcast that doesn't accept that some words,
00:22:57 regardless of context, are always inappropriate?
00:23:00 I do want to be that podcast, because every podcast should be that podcast.
00:23:05 I'm not saying that this is a particularly tactful use just now, but you know.
00:23:10 Everybody laughed.
00:23:12 That's what matters.
00:23:14 I did. You defied my expectations, and you got me to laugh.
00:23:19 You got me the sensible juggles.
00:23:21 But anyway, the point is, is that kind of thinking not the thing,
00:23:24 not the sort of thinking that leads to the rise of fascism, etc.
00:23:29 Because it's like, oh, who knows? Who's to say what's wrong?
00:23:32 No, isn't your kind of thinking leading to that sort of thing?
00:23:35 Because you're policing people like, my way is the right way,
00:23:37 and everyone who's wrong is wrong, therefore they should be eliminated.
00:23:41 The, the, I, well, hold on.
00:23:44 Don't put this on me. I'm just asking questions.
00:23:47 I'm just asking questions.
00:23:48 I'm also asking questions.
00:23:50 Alright, well my questions are better than your questions.
00:23:53 There will be no answer found here today.
00:23:55 I really didn't want politics to come in yet again.
00:23:58 But like, but like, in my heart of hearts,
00:24:00 I know that it's not necessarily a bad thing to talk about politics.
00:24:04 I just never have anything to say of worth.
00:24:06 Same.
00:24:07 Because I...
00:24:08 What do you mean? You're saying shit.
00:24:09 We're having a debate.
00:24:10 We're having an actual debate.
00:24:11 This isn't so much about politics as opinions and the freedom of opinions.
00:24:16 It's not as political as hashtag yangang, exactly.
00:24:21 Indeed, indeed.
00:24:22 But it's ideological.
00:24:23 What was I trying to say?
00:24:24 I'm making politics. I don't care.
00:24:25 I'm not American. I don't care for politics.
00:24:27 Okay, but we're not there.
00:24:29 I want to believe that purple is the best color
00:24:32 and no one can tell me otherwise.
00:24:34 You can't control the flow of conversation.
00:24:38 I mean, you're trying to.
00:24:40 That's why I didn't butt in either.
00:24:41 You just got to let people talk about politics
00:24:44 if they want to talk about politics.
00:24:46 Okay, we're going back to...
00:24:47 Skip the video, maybe.
00:24:49 Let's not go back.
00:24:51 Let's fucking dig into this.
00:24:53 I want to go back to opinions.
00:24:55 I don't think it'll just be...
00:24:56 We won't...
00:24:57 We already know what the issue is.
00:24:59 I want to expand.
00:25:01 I want to expand.
00:25:03 Yes, Mage, expand.
00:25:05 The reason I hold this opinion is not necessarily
00:25:08 because I think it's the best way forward.
00:25:10 I don't think it's possible to make people...
00:25:14 All the people just follow rules all the time
00:25:16 and not expect rebellion.
00:25:18 Well, I think within the freedom of being able to choose your own opinions,
00:25:23 maybe Darwin's Law will come into play
00:25:25 and all the stupid people will die out.
00:25:27 I don't know.
00:25:28 Well, here's the question.
00:25:30 Say you're a mod.
00:25:32 I just want truth to be out there, not suppressed
00:25:36 because a lot of the time, truth is suppressed
00:25:38 in favor of...
00:25:40 What's best for the people isn't necessarily the truth,
00:25:43 is a popular opinion.
00:25:44 And I don't like that.
00:25:45 I want to know the truth
00:25:46 and I want to base my opinions on the available truth.
00:25:49 And I can't tell what the truth is
00:25:51 without knowing all sides of the story.
00:25:53 And therefore, I want to know all sides of the story
00:25:55 so I can find the truth myself
00:25:57 and then decide on my own what I want to believe.
00:26:00 Well, question.
00:26:01 What if someone's lying?
00:26:02 What if someone's going on the internet
00:26:04 or wherever going on podcasts?
00:26:06 Of course, of course.
00:26:07 What if they're going and they're spreading lies
00:26:09 and misinformation?
00:26:10 Yeah, and it's up to each individual person
00:26:12 to see if, you know, it leads to truth.
00:26:16 Right there, Ben.
00:26:17 You're assigning malice to that,
00:26:18 but I mean, I'm sure you would agree that...
00:26:20 I'm not assigning that.
00:26:21 They could be doing it by accident.
00:26:23 Oh, okay.
00:26:24 But to lie by accident is not actually a lie.
00:26:26 It's just a mistake.
00:26:27 I didn't say lie.
00:26:28 Well, I did say lying,
00:26:29 but I also said spreading and misinformation.
00:26:31 It happens.
00:26:32 It happens a lot.
00:26:33 As I said, it happens a lot,
00:26:35 but there's a chaotic element in this.
00:26:39 It's not ideal.
00:26:40 It's not perfect.
00:26:41 It doesn't always give the best results.
00:26:43 I know that, but I prefer this
00:26:45 to being told what to think.
00:26:47 I don't like the whole militant idea of, like,
00:26:51 someone decides what's best for you.
00:26:53 Therefore, it's best for you.
00:26:54 Don't question it.
00:26:55 Just follow orders.
00:26:56 Be a robot.
00:26:57 Live your life the way everyone tells you to.
00:26:59 I don't like it.
00:27:00 Well...
00:27:01 I think we've literally covered everything we can cover.
00:27:04 I want to say one more thing.
00:27:06 I don't think we've risen to the level of talking about,
00:27:09 like, should we put a legal ban on saying certain things,
00:27:14 although I guess we could ask that question.
00:27:16 I mean, we're talking about a mod on Mastodon.
00:27:21 We're talking about an individual
00:27:23 that is charged with moderating a community.
00:27:25 In 1984, the story wasn't so much.
00:27:28 It wasn't really a story about how the state imposed control
00:27:32 of everyone.
00:27:33 It was about how the people rose up and demanded
00:27:35 that they be policed and that their speech be controlled,
00:27:38 and it was the people themselves who did it to each other,
00:27:41 as opposed to, like, the government doing it.
00:27:43 So, you know, this is a danger from just within society.
00:27:47 We've got corporations that do it now,
00:27:49 and they're going beyond the government's control,
00:27:52 which doesn't reach this far, at least in America.
00:27:54 Yes.
00:27:56 I mean, in 1984, it was...
00:27:58 I mean, the people did it to each other,
00:28:00 but the government enforced...
00:28:01 I don't know.
00:28:02 I guess it's sort of chicken and egg thing about,
00:28:04 like, did the government impose this on the people
00:28:06 in order to do the people want this,
00:28:08 and the government took advantage of that public desire
00:28:11 or whatever.
00:28:13 I mean...
00:28:15 I don't know how to...
00:28:17 Stop talking now.
00:28:19 Let's move on.
00:28:20 Let's move on to something else.
00:28:22 Fair.
00:28:23 Hey.
00:28:24 No, you've done enough.
00:28:25 You've done enough to yabber in.
00:28:27 Okay. Fair.
00:28:28 I got a thing to talk about.
00:28:30 I've been a bit by the animation bug,
00:28:33 you know, that I did animation at uni,
00:28:37 and then I just stopped.
00:28:38 I made my three films, and then I just sort of didn't do that,
00:28:40 and I went to YouTube and I made video game reviews,
00:28:43 like a fucking idiot.
00:28:44 What a disaster.
00:28:46 Yeah, but recently, you know,
00:28:49 while animating the finale of my webcomic,
00:28:52 I was like, you know, animating's good,
00:28:54 and I like the planning,
00:28:55 I like the animatics and the storyboarding
00:28:57 and all that stuff.
00:28:58 And so, in rapid succession,
00:29:02 there's like two MAPs, multi-animator projects,
00:29:05 unfortunate acronym, but, you know, there we are.
00:29:08 Oh, Miss Anthropony, please come back.
00:29:11 Yes, exactly.
00:29:12 So, like, I'm...
00:29:13 I fucking love that guy.
00:29:14 Miss Anthropony, if you're in the comments,
00:29:16 let us know you're there.
00:29:17 Oh, and if we can see you at BronyCon.
00:29:20 And see you at BronyCon, yes.
00:29:22 Oh, for sure.
00:29:23 Yeah.
00:29:24 I'm serious, I want to fucking...
00:29:27 Ben's gonna get bullied by Miss Anthropony at BronyCon.
00:29:30 He's gonna kick the dick.
00:29:31 I don't think so.
00:29:33 I think we've gone past that.
00:29:35 I think we can have a meeting of the minds.
00:29:38 I'm not even kidding.
00:29:39 I'm not even joking.
00:29:40 I think it would be really fun to, like,
00:29:42 fucking shake hands with Miss Anthropony.
00:29:45 You should take a ceremonial picture of
00:29:47 both of you kicking each other in the dick simultaneously.
00:29:50 Exactly.
00:29:51 That would be iconic.
00:29:52 That would be great.
00:29:53 That would be great.
00:29:54 But, yeah, like, I've been...
00:29:56 I signed up for a Homestuck MAP,
00:30:00 and I'm animating, like, two scenes,
00:30:02 and it's just going really well,
00:30:04 and I'm liking it.
00:30:05 And then I'm still, like,
00:30:07 subbed to Crown Prince, the wolf lady.
00:30:09 Yep.
00:30:10 The wolf lady from the thing.
00:30:11 She had an MAP.
00:30:12 Is she a horse lady?
00:30:14 No, she's always been a wolf.
00:30:16 Wait, no, she's a horse.
00:30:17 She had a horse, but, yeah, you're right.
00:30:19 She's more of a wolf.
00:30:20 Oh, she did.
00:30:21 She's more of a wolf.
00:30:22 She's more of a wolf.
00:30:23 Deep Lore.
00:30:24 But, yeah.
00:30:25 And she had one which is, like, a really short one,
00:30:27 with a much more sensible deadline.
00:30:29 The Homestuck one is, like, for 413.
00:30:31 It's, like, a big, epic 10-year anniversary
00:30:33 of the beginning Homestuck.
00:30:34 Yeah, catch me one week from then.
00:30:35 420, my dude, if you know what I'm saying.
00:30:38 Hey.
00:30:39 Speaking of which, let me check the calendar.
00:30:41 So, yeah, animation's cool, and I really like
00:30:43 that I'm getting back into a craft
00:30:45 that I've sort of given, like, forgotten about.
00:30:47 It's really cool.
00:30:48 Yeah, that's good.
00:30:49 I feel strong and powerful.
00:30:51 That's really cool.
00:30:52 I mean, it was probably a year ago you made,
00:30:53 what was it, Descend, Estesend, or whatever it is?
00:30:55 Yeah, that was barely an animation.
00:30:57 That was just sort of, like, moving drawings around
00:30:59 in Adobe Premiere.
00:31:01 Like, squiggly lines going on and what not.
00:31:03 It was awesome, though.
00:31:04 It was, yeah.
00:31:05 For anyone, Estesend is a RFCK thing
00:31:08 that is on, it's on the Hippocrite channel, right?
00:31:11 It's on Given Fortress 2.
00:31:13 Right, it's on Given Fortress 2.
00:31:15 It's also clipped on the RFCK Twitch.
00:31:17 Indeed.
00:31:18 Yeah, Twitch.tv slash Rowdy Frickers cop killers.
00:31:22 What was it like to get back into it, Hippo?
00:31:24 Did you, was there any period of, like,
00:31:27 oh, what the fuck is a Toon Studio or whatever I would do?
00:31:34 The beginning was like, I wanted to make an animation
00:31:37 for the end of Balejap.
00:31:39 And so I was going, like, okay, I did this in uni
00:31:43 and pre-production is the key.
00:31:45 If you pre-produce, you know, properly,
00:31:48 then everything falls into place very easily
00:31:50 and then animation is simply, you know, busy work
00:31:53 rather than brain work and you can just get through it.
00:31:56 Yeah.
00:31:57 And by, you know, looking at, like, calendar dates
00:32:00 and thinking about how fast I could make certain scenes
00:32:03 and going through the animatic and the storyboard
00:32:06 and it was just sort of, I just sort of fell right back into it.
00:32:09 I really enjoyed myself making this come together
00:32:12 and all the little gifts that I was making
00:32:14 to, like, show various discourse that are animation-based
00:32:18 and just like, hey, guys, look at this.
00:32:20 It's cool.
00:32:22 I'm good at art
00:32:25 and it's great.
00:32:26 And, you know, my favorite thing about animation
00:32:28 is that you don't need to be good at drawing to do it.
00:32:30 The whole point is that any one drawing stays on screen.
00:32:34 Any one drawing stays on screen for such a small time
00:32:36 that it's okay to be kind of bad at drawing,
00:32:38 which is why I got into it in the first place.
00:32:41 Time, let me gripe about people that post, like,
00:32:44 smear frames from animation
00:32:46 and are like, haha, look how bad this looks.
00:32:49 Well, dumb.
00:32:50 And it's like posting a frame is stupid.
00:32:53 I like that really wide one of Superman
00:32:55 that doesn't prove anything
00:32:57 that one frame in an animation is, like, weird-looking.
00:33:00 Are you familiar with that one?
00:33:02 It's Superman, like, moving sideways into the frame,
00:33:04 but, like, in this one moment,
00:33:06 he's stretched across, like, the entire canvas of the screen.
00:33:09 I have not seen that,
00:33:10 but have you seen the one of the cheerleaders and Kim Possible?
00:33:14 No, no, I haven't.
00:33:15 There's one of, like, all of them sort of in the group,
00:33:18 like, move down.
00:33:19 Like, they squat down really fast before I jump or something.
00:33:22 And so, like, all of their faces are, like, stretched
00:33:25 and, like, stretched.
00:33:27 Their entire face is, like, stretched down,
00:33:29 like, the entire length of their bodies.
00:33:32 Do people actually laugh at that?
00:33:34 Or do, like...
00:33:35 I think at some point, some people did.
00:33:37 I mean, okay, look at this.
00:33:38 This isn't the one I was thinking of.
00:33:39 Check this out.
00:33:40 But look at just...
00:33:41 This is one of the many Superman smear frames.
00:33:43 And I think you'll appreciate it.
00:33:45 Okay, it's fucking loading.
00:33:46 All of the references I've seen to this
00:33:48 just seem to be, like, haha, well, that's crazy.
00:33:51 It looks like that in-between animation.
00:33:53 Not that it's necessarily, like, bad.
00:33:55 I don't think anyone thinks it's bad.
00:33:57 I've seen people post it about, like, anime.
00:34:00 Like, Naruto.
00:34:01 Well, it's funny you say that.
00:34:03 I see a lot of people deliberately celebrating smear frames
00:34:07 in the Sakuga community.
00:34:09 Like, it used to be...
00:34:11 There was a huge backlash against the fact
00:34:13 that people would always, like, shout bad animation
00:34:16 at, like, uh, Shonen stuff.
00:34:19 And, like, when there'd just be, like, a character
00:34:21 who looks off, like, in the background
00:34:23 and people would highlight it and be, like,
00:34:25 this looks terrible.
00:34:26 Though, personally, it's kind of funny because
00:34:29 while I appreciate why, like, it's annoying to people
00:34:33 that that kind of stuff gets brought up
00:34:35 and called bad animation, you know?
00:34:37 Nonetheless, it's not like it's impossible
00:34:40 to not have that happen.
00:34:43 But, like...
00:34:44 It's not a... No, but it's...
00:34:46 But with smear frames, those are obviously there
00:34:48 on purpose, like, they're a part of the animation.
00:34:51 They're meant to be seen in motion.
00:34:54 They look fucking hilarious and great, though.
00:34:57 I mean, this is a technique.
00:34:59 This is an animation technique.
00:35:01 I mean, yeah, it's literally to make up for the fact
00:35:03 that you can only animate so many frames per second.
00:35:07 So fucking wide.
00:35:08 Oh, wait, okay, I found the one.
00:35:10 If animation was, like, 120 frames per second,
00:35:13 you would draw each one of those.
00:35:15 Because you literally can't.
00:35:17 That's the best one, yeah.
00:35:19 That's so...
00:35:20 What amuses me is the face he makes.
00:35:23 It's like, it reminds me of that one anime face.
00:35:26 That one actually looks like he's just really wide
00:35:29 and rectangular, making a face.
00:35:31 He looks like Balrog from Cave Story.
00:35:33 Yeah, yes.
00:35:34 Well, I was thinking the TV man from Dead Leaves,
00:35:38 but that is pretty similar to Balrog.
00:35:40 Did you... I watched that anime at your recommendation
00:35:43 just the other day, and it is very, very much...
00:35:46 He's like a very, very munchie-core.
00:35:48 ...get an ai-kai face. Hold on, I'm gonna post this.
00:35:50 It's very, very munchie-core. I love this face.
00:35:52 It seemed like it. It seemed like it.
00:35:54 I don't know, are you down with, like, the dick jokes
00:35:56 and the dick humor too much, though, Munchie?
00:35:58 You seem like you would be into that.
00:35:59 Why would Munchie not be into dicks?
00:36:01 Yeah.
00:36:02 Because he hates sex.
00:36:03 He doesn't want to think about the existence of the penile.
00:36:05 Munchie draws dicks all the time.
00:36:07 That is a gross misinterpretation of my hatred for sex.
00:36:11 But doesn't it, like, fuck, and, like, there is a baby,
00:36:13 and that's gross, that's sex?
00:36:15 It's really cool when people fucking movies.
00:36:17 What, am I stupid? Am I brain dead?
00:36:19 That thing is not?
00:36:21 I don't know.
00:36:22 It's really fucking cool. It's cathartic.
00:36:24 It's like seeing a dude get...
00:36:26 Okay, I think of sex in movies the same way as getting,
00:36:28 like, someone's head blown off in a movie,
00:36:30 and they're fucking gore splatters across the window.
00:36:33 That's exactly what I'm like, oh!
00:36:36 He screams when he sees it.
00:36:39 Yeah.
00:36:40 But in a cool way.
00:36:41 Yeah, same. I agree.
00:36:43 I kind of lost the plot here.
00:36:45 But I really think it's really cool that you're trying to get back
00:36:49 into something that you've sort of thrown to the wayside
00:36:52 in the pursuit of more...
00:36:55 Gold.
00:36:56 You know.
00:36:57 Terrible.
00:36:58 Interesting aspirations.
00:37:01 Oh, yeah.
00:37:02 I mean, like, I never really meant to throw it to the wayside,
00:37:05 but my overwhelming feeling coming out of animation college
00:37:10 was this is really depressing and difficult,
00:37:15 and so many people try so hard,
00:37:17 and all they end up doing is, like, advertisements,
00:37:20 and they never...
00:37:22 When they're 45, they finally get enough money to make a short film,
00:37:26 and I'm like, Jesus Christ, no, end.
00:37:28 I don't want to do that.
00:37:30 So, like, as a career prospect,
00:37:33 they didn't seem like the best thing to go for
00:37:36 because of the way I approached animation.
00:37:39 I felt more fun, you know, doing silly little small things
00:37:44 that weren't, like, you couldn't really sell the stuff I do that well.
00:37:48 I mean, maybe you could, but, like...
00:37:51 Yeah.
00:37:52 And then I became a writer, and now that's my job,
00:37:55 and now animation can become a hobby again, which is great.
00:37:58 Yeah.
00:37:59 Yeah, that's kind of...
00:38:00 There's probably some kind of bell curve or a bounce to be found there,
00:38:03 and it kind of makes me wonder if, like, for your average,
00:38:05 like, non-career established with, like, a large income or following
00:38:10 or anything, for a person like that,
00:38:12 I wonder if it makes sense to, like, have a day job of whatever kind
00:38:15 and then to make their passion project be something they can spend years on
00:38:18 if they want to, and then to, you know, make it as good as they can.
00:38:21 I mean, that's not a particularly weird, you know, set of circumstances.
00:38:26 I mean, that's literally what I've been doing for years, so, you know.
00:38:29 I think there's a lot of value to that, actually.
00:38:31 I think there's a lot of value to having that sort of normal life,
00:38:36 you know, out in the world doing maybe a nine-to-five
00:38:39 or even just whatever other...
00:38:40 That's why...
00:38:41 ...mini-label job you have.
00:38:42 And then, you know, come home and unwind.
00:38:44 I mean, I've been changed in my approach lately,
00:38:47 but, like, that's why the six-month-long for a video sort of things
00:38:50 were, you know, taken so long.
00:38:52 What's interesting about, like, working, you know,
00:38:56 just not having a job that you go to wake up, honey, toast, please,
00:39:01 thank you, kiss, goodbye, instead of having something like that
00:39:04 where you can just come home at the end of the day and be like,
00:39:07 well, I'm off from work, and then maybe you can turn on the telly
00:39:11 or maybe you can turn on, you know, your canvas
00:39:14 and give out your praying bushes or something,
00:39:16 you know, you have free time that is clearly yours
00:39:20 as opposed to that when you're doing what we do
00:39:23 and just every waking moment from the moment you wake up
00:39:26 to the moment you go to bed, you could theoretically be doing work.
00:39:31 That's the life of an entrepreneur in one way or another.
00:39:34 There's a lot of benefits to it.
00:39:37 There's a lot of mental negatives to it, I feel.
00:39:40 That's fair.
00:39:41 It's not for everybody.
00:39:42 I think that's for sure.
00:39:43 I greatly...
00:39:45 I almost value it.
00:39:47 I think I might have pushed it away too much, like, out of sight, out of mind
00:39:51 in my youth, and I've been really considered the idea
00:39:54 of having a...
00:39:56 Especially what Hippo is describing
00:39:58 of sort of like animation being like a busy work sort of thing,
00:40:01 just having a job that is sort of menial tasks,
00:40:06 I kind of made it, in my mind, decided,
00:40:09 oh, I'm not going to do that.
00:40:10 That's stupid.
00:40:11 I wouldn't do that.
00:40:12 I didn't even consider it for a while.
00:40:14 But more and more, as I grow maybe a month or two older, I think,
00:40:19 maybe that's actually a good idea.
00:40:21 Maybe I actually want to do that.
00:40:23 Maybe I actually want to have dedicated work time,
00:40:26 where I can spend doing something that isn't necessarily creative pursuits.
00:40:31 And then when I get home, I'll just have that time to myself
00:40:33 when I can do what I please.
00:40:35 I resent.
00:40:37 Listen, I understand the idea that having a regular 9-5
00:40:42 provides structure in your life and is maybe good in a pragmatic sense.
00:40:47 But I hate...
00:40:49 I can't stand the idea that I am laboring with the goal
00:40:54 of making my boss money,
00:40:56 which is the purpose of labor under capitalism.
00:40:59 Well, I mean, you're making Patreon money with your Patreon.
00:41:01 Are you also upset about that?
00:41:03 I don't think you understood what I just said.
00:41:06 I didn't say not...
00:41:07 They're your boss, basically.
00:41:09 You fool.
00:41:10 Yeah, but I'm not working to make money for them.
00:41:12 I don't understand. Aren't you, though?
00:41:14 You are making money.
00:41:15 No, of course not.
00:41:16 How?
00:41:17 Are you having a stroke?
00:41:19 I mean, you need money to live.
00:41:21 Make money for them.
00:41:23 Make money for them.
00:41:25 And when you have a job, you labor so that the person employing you
00:41:29 generates wealth for themselves.
00:41:31 I mean, it's called a job,
00:41:33 and you agree to do the job to get paid,
00:41:36 and the reason you have the job
00:41:38 is because you can provide value to your employer.
00:41:41 That's right.
00:41:42 And I don't want to provide value to an employer.
00:41:45 You...
00:41:47 Nate, you got lost.
00:41:49 You were talking about the fact that Patreon takes a cut of your earnings.
00:41:53 Yeah.
00:41:54 That's correct.
00:41:55 But that doesn't necessarily contradict what Ben was saying.
00:41:58 I don't think that's what Nate was talking about,
00:42:00 but that does annoy me.
00:42:03 That does annoy me.
00:42:05 I mean, there's the patrons as well, I suppose.
00:42:07 What the fuck are you talking about?
00:42:09 I'm not making money for my patrons by working for their money.
00:42:13 That's not what's happening.
00:42:14 Isn't that exactly what you're doing?
00:42:16 Are you insane?
00:42:17 What are you talking about?
00:42:18 Wait, wait, wait.
00:42:19 Sorry, you said making money for them.
00:42:20 Yes.
00:42:21 Okay, not money, but you are providing value,
00:42:24 so it's not money.
00:42:25 Okay, but Ben's point is,
00:42:27 is simply that if he works for a boss in a regular job...
00:42:30 Ben just got some issue with money, I guess.
00:42:32 Shut up.
00:42:33 What did you say it?
00:42:34 No, you fucking idiot.
00:42:35 If Ben is working at a regular job,
00:42:37 then that means that his boss is making money off of him,
00:42:41 and he does not want that.
00:42:43 That's what he's trying to say.
00:42:44 That's correct.
00:42:45 He does not want his effort to make money for other people.
00:42:48 And you resent the idea of other people having a boss.
00:42:52 No.
00:42:53 Why are you putting fucking words in my mouth?
00:42:55 Listen, I said this in the comments in the last video.
00:42:57 Someone was like,
00:42:58 Ben, something, something, something.
00:43:00 This must be why you resent people with corporate jobs.
00:43:02 And I said,
00:43:03 I don't resent people with corporate jobs.
00:43:05 I get it.
00:43:06 You gotta do what you gotta do.
00:43:07 Nothing wrong with making a living.
00:43:09 But I resent the jobs themselves.
00:43:11 Jobs are, I mean, not always, but, you know, a lot of,
00:43:14 I mean, jobs exist to generate value for the employer and,
00:43:18 you know,
00:43:19 They also exist to, like, make the world happen.
00:43:23 I don't know.
00:43:25 I don't think they do under capitalism.
00:43:27 I don't want to get into this, dude.
00:43:28 I will just get mad.
00:43:29 You are so retarded, Ben.
00:43:31 You're the dumbest person on the planet.
00:43:33 This pisses me off.
00:43:34 I would say,
00:43:35 well, explain, Nate, why you gotta back that up.
00:43:37 I don't want to get in.
00:43:38 Look, just your whole conception about the exploitation of the worker
00:43:42 who agrees to do the job.
00:43:44 Oh, no.
00:43:45 It's so sad they're being abused by agreeing to take the job
00:43:48 that their employer beneficially gives to them to do
00:43:51 what a sad Satan fares.
00:43:53 I'm going to take the high road and not get mad,
00:43:55 even though you are completely misquoting me
00:43:57 and putting words in my mouth that I didn't say.
00:43:59 I love you.
00:44:00 I love you.
00:44:01 There you go.
00:44:02 Aw.
00:44:03 You fucker.
00:44:06 That reminds me a very different topic quickly.
00:44:10 The video that you guys recently released,
00:44:13 I just realized at the very end,
00:44:15 you guys lay in one bed, marriage confirmed.
00:44:18 Yeah.
00:44:19 Indeed.
00:44:20 True.
00:44:21 This was never in doubt.
00:44:22 And as with every marriage,
00:44:24 there is one intellectual superior and one intellectual inferior.
00:44:27 I would agree.
00:44:28 And I think we've made our cases well here.
00:44:30 I think we know who's who, wink, wink.
00:44:32 Indeed.
00:44:33 Audience will understand my point.
00:44:36 They will understand the truth.
00:44:38 So is the ending of the T-Bap not an angry beavers reference?
00:44:43 I have no idea what you meant when you said that.
00:44:46 It wasn't intended.
00:44:47 There's this episode of angry beavers where the two of them
00:44:51 wake up after experiencing some kind of dream within a dream
00:44:56 kind of thing and I think one of them slaps the other
00:44:58 and then they keep waking up.
00:45:00 Or no, it was a time travel thing.
00:45:02 I don't fucking know.
00:45:03 No, he kept slapping him into last Tuesday.
00:45:05 That's what it was.
00:45:06 He kept slapping him so hard that he would go back in time
00:45:09 or something like that.
00:45:10 I mean, it sounds hilarious, but it was not intended to be.
00:45:12 I watched angry beavers and I don't remember that.
00:45:15 This is all I remember from angry beavers.
00:45:17 I saw like 15 minutes of an episode at a friend's house once
00:45:20 and it was like the one kept slapping the other back in time
00:45:24 and then like it kept happening again.
00:45:26 And it just had a very similar vibe to that scene in T-Bap,
00:45:31 especially because Phantom kept slapping Keg for some reason.
00:45:35 Because it was the joke.
00:45:37 Because it uses funny.
00:45:40 It was just very...
00:45:41 It felt like a reference.
00:45:43 The question is, Nate and Ben, was the ending of this video
00:45:47 a reference to this bit of a show that no one remembers
00:45:52 and I remember even less.
00:45:54 This very specific moment from the show.
00:45:57 Was it a reference to that?
00:45:59 I don't think so, did you?
00:46:00 I don't think so.
00:46:01 Well, I didn't know if you guys knew it.
00:46:03 I don't know if you guys fucking were huge angry beavers fans.
00:46:06 I actually did.
00:46:07 I actually did really like Angry Beavers.
00:46:10 But I don't remember that specific episode.
00:46:12 I'm gonna find this fucking scene.
00:46:14 It's the one with the beavers.
00:46:16 It's the one with the blonde guy and the one with the red nose.
00:46:18 Yes.
00:46:19 I think I've seen the little beavers.
00:46:21 Norman something?
00:46:22 Angry Beavers Cow and Chicken.
00:46:24 What else?
00:46:25 Cow and Chicken sucked Angry Beavers rule.
00:46:27 That's my official opinion on the subject.
00:46:29 I remember the one where...
00:46:31 Oh, God.
00:46:32 I remember the one I remember best is...
00:46:34 Okay, it was the one with...
00:46:35 They have this candy or something called Lickety Splits
00:46:38 and it's just like a lot with like sap in the middle.
00:46:40 They did gambling or something?
00:46:41 I think so.
00:46:43 Oh, then it was like who...
00:46:44 If they lost some challenge,
00:46:45 the other one had to be their servant for one day or something.
00:46:48 I remember one where they can't sleep.
00:46:50 Like they dare each other.
00:46:52 Like who can go the long way without sleeping
00:46:54 and eventually they get too tired to sleep
00:46:56 and they just stay awake for like eternity.
00:46:59 It was like dystopic.
00:47:02 Okay.
00:47:03 Hey, this is all cool and all,
00:47:04 but on the subject of...
00:47:06 Of race and politics, God damn it.
00:47:09 No, no, no.
00:47:10 Of T-Bap Resurrection.
00:47:11 Let's talk more about that.
00:47:12 So people, in case you didn't see it,
00:47:14 it's not on this channel, but on T-Bap.
00:47:16 It's official T-Bap release.
00:47:18 Episode 26 of T-Bap officially.
00:47:21 Excluding the podcast.
00:47:22 It's only 26.
00:47:24 I checked the stats and...
00:47:26 Oh my God.
00:47:27 Yeah, that was...
00:47:28 Well, I mean, so the whole podcast happened,
00:47:29 but it was the 26th mainline,
00:47:31 like normally edited T-Bap episode.
00:47:34 And it's out.
00:47:36 We max-revived.
00:47:37 It took 9,000 dollars for you to edit one of those videos.
00:47:39 Yes, it was the top award tier,
00:47:41 or it was the top stretch goal for Radcon.
00:47:44 We hit it to max-revive T-Bap,
00:47:46 and we fucking did it.
00:47:48 It has been max-revived, although...
00:47:50 Which was the last promised thing from Radcon 3.
00:47:53 We have delivered on everything we said
00:47:55 we would do at Radcon 3 officially.
00:47:56 And just for the record,
00:47:57 it was on the exact one-year anniversary.
00:47:59 Yes.
00:48:00 It was released yesterday of the day
00:48:02 Radcon 3 ended proper as we were doing it live
00:48:05 in the arena, so...
00:48:07 It's time to start looking forward, guys.
00:48:09 It is.
00:48:10 It is.
00:48:11 I still want that GRPJ, goddammit, though.
00:48:14 That was not a promise.
00:48:17 That was not a Radcon promise.
00:48:19 Oh, okay.
00:48:20 Munchy, can I put you on the spot?
00:48:22 No, you can't.
00:48:23 You can't do that.
00:48:24 Okay, I won, then.
00:48:25 That wasn't an article in the Rad contract.
00:48:28 Indeed.
00:48:29 Indeed it was not.
00:48:30 Well, I'm curious about it.
00:48:31 We can talk about it later.
00:48:32 No, we can't.
00:48:33 I know.
00:48:34 I know.
00:48:35 What?
00:48:36 No, stop.
00:48:37 Stop.
00:48:38 Hippo, you fucking bitch.
00:48:39 Fucking kill yourself.
00:48:40 Fucking kill yourself!
00:48:41 Fucking kill yourself!
00:48:42 Okay, all right, all right.
00:48:44 Okay, fine.
00:48:45 Let's move on to Radcon 4,
00:48:47 because we gotta do it.
00:48:48 Wait, let me just finish my comment here,
00:48:50 and we can do that.
00:48:51 But I just want to thank everybody
00:48:52 who was involved in helping.
00:48:54 That was Gib and Jesse, obviously,
00:48:57 providing voice acting.
00:48:58 I really liked how that intro played out.
00:49:01 It was good.
00:49:02 I think it was great.
00:49:03 It was lore rich.
00:49:04 Despite the fact that neither of us
00:49:06 listened to each other's audio,
00:49:08 we had a good back and forth going.
00:49:10 Indeed.
00:49:11 We wrote out lines, so it was great.
00:49:13 Okay, I cannot find this fucking episode of Angry Beavers,
00:49:16 but I figured out exactly what's going on in it.
00:49:19 What happens is that the one beaver
00:49:21 is continually annoying his brother all week,
00:49:24 finding new ways to annoy him,
00:49:26 and then the brother bops him into last week.
00:49:29 That's the idea.
00:49:30 He pits him so hard he goes back in time,
00:49:32 but it keeps happening.
00:49:34 Every time he reaches the end of the week,
00:49:35 he has annoyed his brother so much
00:49:37 that he bops him into last week,
00:49:38 and it just keeps happening until he finally stops annoying him.
00:49:42 Fascinating.
00:49:43 So do more and more time clones start appearing
00:49:46 because he keeps getting sent back in a time loop?
00:49:49 I don't know if it's one of those time travel versions.
00:49:51 I don't think it's like that.
00:49:52 It's grandpa day, but beaver day.
00:49:53 Yeah.
00:49:54 Maybe the episode's called beaver day.
00:49:56 That's pretty funny.
00:49:57 That's pretty funny.
00:49:58 He's got to learn his lesson or whatever.
00:50:00 He's like,
00:50:01 I keep getting punched in the nose or whatever.
00:50:04 I keep getting punched.
00:50:05 Why does he keep repeating?
00:50:06 No matter what I do, I keep repeating the week.
00:50:09 It's got to be it's got to be Norm punching.
00:50:11 Norm's the one who annoys Dag generally.
00:50:13 No, no, no. Dag's the brown one.
00:50:15 Yeah.
00:50:16 Is Norm kind of the smarmy, know-it-all asshole?
00:50:19 Yeah, but Dag is the stupid funny one.
00:50:23 So I would imagine it was Dag annoying Norm.
00:50:25 Okay, maybe.
00:50:26 Yeah, that is the case.
00:50:27 Oh, okay.
00:50:28 All right, for now.
00:50:29 Cha-ching.
00:50:30 Hey, wait.
00:50:31 Wait, let me finish my goddamn thank yous, goddammit.
00:50:33 I just want to thank-
00:50:34 Why are you giving a fucking Oscar acceptance speech
00:50:36 over releasing the T-Bap episode?
00:50:38 Why is this happening?
00:50:39 I just want to say thank you to fit MC for recording
00:50:41 and Victor for filming.
00:50:43 That's it.
00:50:44 That's all I wanted to fucking say.
00:50:45 It was a big deal, but you made it a big deal.
00:50:47 You unzipped me, you piece of fucking shit.
00:50:49 Why did you make me do this?
00:50:51 You ruined my Oscar acceptance speech.
00:50:53 It was going to be such a positive moment.
00:50:55 And now it's ruined.
00:50:56 Did fit MC voice the dad?
00:50:58 Is that what that was?
00:50:59 That's not the dad.
00:51:00 That's not their dad.
00:51:01 That's their manager.
00:51:02 That's whatever.
00:51:03 Or producer.
00:51:04 The reason I said the dad is because I thought
00:51:06 that your dad had voiced him.
00:51:09 No.
00:51:10 That would have been very interesting.
00:51:12 Yeah.
00:51:13 Fit MC voiced Risky Business in T-Bap Resurrection.
00:51:18 Their dad, Gold Standard, appears in...
00:51:22 Gold Standard appears in...
00:51:24 Phantom Reviews?
00:51:25 Phantom Reviews.
00:51:26 Yes, in Phantom Reviews.
00:51:27 And he was voiced by Jesse.
00:51:30 And their mom, Angel Food, was also voiced.
00:51:34 And was that voiced by Jesse?
00:51:36 He was voiced by Jenny Whatserface.
00:51:38 Jenny Nicholson.
00:51:39 That's right.
00:51:40 Really?
00:51:41 You got her?
00:51:42 Yes.
00:51:43 We also got Jenny Nicholson.
00:51:44 I know.
00:51:45 She also played Kimmy Sparkle in the cutie marker fuffle part 3.
00:51:49 Yes.
00:51:50 Which was her character.
00:51:51 But she also voiced Angel Food.
00:51:52 Which is cool.
00:51:53 We did it, lads.
00:51:55 Incidentally, for those who don't know, Ben and I...
00:51:58 So there was some weird thing.
00:51:59 We were both kind of on track to play a character in Friendship as Witchcraft.
00:52:04 And there is one or two lines.
00:52:06 I think it's actually both me and Ben doing two different bits of this character.
00:52:11 This was weird.
00:52:13 They were working on the next episode of Friendship as Witchcraft.
00:52:16 And they asked both of us to voice this character, Craig.
00:52:21 The character was going to be just a regular human who didn't know what was going on.
00:52:27 And was a completely normal person, human person in the world of Friendship as Witchcraft.
00:52:32 But he traveled through the Portland and became a pony.
00:52:35 That was the thing happening to him.
00:52:36 Was he?
00:52:37 Yeah, he walks through the portal in his first appearance.
00:52:39 Oh, I thought he was literally a human.
00:52:42 Like a human human.
00:52:44 He was a human, but he walks through the portal and goes to the Pony World.
00:52:47 I know, but I thought he wasn't a pony.
00:52:49 But whatever.
00:52:50 Okay, maybe I'm wrong.
00:52:51 But yeah.
00:52:52 There was like one line or two lines.
00:52:54 And I think they were going to just alternate between our voices or something.
00:52:58 There was some confusion.
00:52:59 Look, we were fighting over this role a little bit.
00:53:01 So there was some...
00:53:02 Yeah, we both really wanted to do it.
00:53:04 There was a little bit of shenanigans going on there.
00:53:06 They were like, I could be the singing voice and Ben could be the speaking voice or some shit like that.
00:53:10 Really?
00:53:11 I mean that.
00:53:12 Yeah, that was disgust.
00:53:13 The way you're describing it, it makes it feel like they approached maybe both of you to cast a wide net.
00:53:20 And when you both found out, they were like, oh, Jesus Christ.
00:53:23 I really wish they had just come and asked one of us.
00:53:25 I really hope the corporate red tape from that was like the reason the episode never got done.
00:53:30 They couldn't resolve the conflict.
00:53:31 I'm sure that was it.
00:53:33 From what you described, I assumed that they were just telling you both that this guy was perfectly normal.
00:53:39 So you would play him that way when the reality is that he's some kind of like weird split personality.
00:53:44 And that they wanted to have a cycle between both of your voices the whole time.
00:53:48 No, I'm afraid not.
00:53:51 Well, anyway, we both...
00:53:55 Who knows what would have happened?
00:53:57 Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
00:53:59 I would argue that Friendship is a T-Bap was the highest produced, the highest production regular show of the Pony Review Crew.
00:54:07 So we certainly had the cred to take this role.
00:54:10 I mean, if you consider a horseshoe to not be a regular show, then...
00:54:16 Well, I do not.
00:54:17 Yeah, I do not.
00:54:18 Because ours was weekly and his was not.
00:54:20 Well, it was pretty close at first to weekly.
00:54:23 Not for very long.
00:54:25 Not for very long.
00:54:28 But whatever, it's not a point.
00:54:29 Anyway, fond memories, fond memories.
00:54:32 But we're canon, two Friendship is Witchcraft lore, so suck it.
00:54:36 Are we?
00:54:37 We're in there.
00:54:38 Yeah, we're in the first episode of Horsewomen. Craig shows up.
00:54:41 Wait, but there is no Horsewomen.
00:54:43 Horse... Episode one was made.
00:54:45 Oh my god.
00:54:46 Was it?
00:54:47 Yes, Ben, yes.
00:54:48 Hmm, sorry, I was drunk. Sorry.
00:54:51 I'm intoxicated.
00:54:52 I was a little bit of an important to say, but angry beavers.
00:54:55 And that's that actually I don't never mind.
00:54:58 Ratcon for everybody. Here we go.
00:55:01 Ratcon for baby.
00:55:03 Maybe, eventually.
00:55:04 I mean, yeah, at some point.
00:55:05 More lectures.
00:55:06 We'll see.
00:55:07 We had ideas for lectures, but none of us have thought...
00:55:12 I have a concrete, hardcore, ready-to-go, anytime idea for a lecture.
00:55:17 So I'm ready.
00:55:18 Like no preparation required?
00:55:20 Yeah, I mean, I would need to draw the board other than that. Nope.
00:55:24 Are you keeping it under wraps?
00:55:26 Yes.
00:55:27 I haven't actually like written out or scripted anything for a lecture until we have like a plan for what we're going to do.
00:55:33 I mean, I know one or two that I would do.
00:55:35 Well, I'll drop this hint.
00:55:37 I don't know.
00:55:38 It's just that I don't need to do any prep work.
00:55:40 I just know everything I need to know already.
00:55:42 So that's sick.
00:55:44 Sick.
00:55:45 Is it about Gurren Lagann?
00:55:47 There's not enough material for a lecture there.
00:55:49 Is it about Homestuck?
00:55:51 Oh, God, I hope so.
00:55:52 I don't know why Nate would be doing the Homestuck lecture.
00:55:54 Because obviously, my famous podcast, Nate Talks About Homestuck, really shook up the metagame of YouTube and changed the world.
00:56:01 I have two planned lectures, but I'm not going to start researching them until we know when Radcon 4 is, because...
00:56:07 That could be forever.
00:56:09 We got it.
00:56:10 Guys, let's do the Radcon 4.
00:56:12 We need Radcon 4 to metastasize already.
00:56:14 Metastasize.
00:56:17 Yeah, I mean, if it's going to happen, we need to actively start thinking about it and planning it.
00:56:21 Yeah, because a lot of people just won't do any prep work until it's decided.
00:56:24 And people are like, well, I'm not going to work on it until I know what I'm going to do.
00:56:27 So, I mean, at some point, you just got to call it.
00:56:29 But that's not going to be for a while, so...
00:56:31 It's looking at this summer.
00:56:33 It's going to be another summer of pain where I'm racing across the map.
00:56:37 Just don't do that, though.
00:56:39 Just have a summer of good.
00:56:40 Yeah, okay.
00:56:41 All right.
00:56:42 That's a good idea.
00:56:43 Hey, Mr. President.
00:56:44 Yes.
00:56:46 Bang!
00:56:47 Sorry, guys.
00:56:48 I shut the present.
00:56:49 I knew I...
00:56:50 All right, this is over.
00:56:51 Oh, no.
00:56:52 What even was that?
00:56:54 Listen, guys.
00:56:55 It was an assassination.
00:56:56 I went to Improv Asylum and I'm suing my fucking director.
00:57:00 He didn't teach me shit.
00:57:02 I'm trying to get some money back.
00:57:04 Hey, speaking of assassinating the president, you were pretty close to doing that the other day, Munchy,
00:57:08 at that Bernie rally.
00:57:09 That's pretty cool, yeah?
00:57:10 Are we really going to recycle content from the bonus episode?
00:57:13 I just want to say we should definitely link in the show notes for non-bonus episode people
00:57:17 that one gift.
00:57:18 Oh, okay.
00:57:19 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:57:20 No upset.
00:57:21 I can't believe that gift is real.
00:57:22 I can't fucking believe it.
00:57:23 I'm still watching it.
00:57:24 If you want to know the full story, then go to the bonus episode of Sunshine and Rainbows.
00:57:31 If you just want to have confirmation that I'm there, click the link in the description
00:57:37 and you might melt.
00:57:40 Indeed.
00:57:41 Bernie's back in California to complete the political revolution.
00:57:45 And there he is!
00:57:47 And there Bernie is!
00:57:50 Just one of the boys that Bernie.
00:57:52 Bernie has moved his soul to a young vessel and is preparing for his new residency.
00:57:57 I have something that I want to bring up.
00:57:59 I don't have a lot to say about it, but I have a bit.
00:58:02 Do you guys know Petscop?
00:58:03 Yeah, of course.
00:58:04 I know.
00:58:05 I'm thinking of the quote-unquote game.
00:58:07 I thought Munchy, I figured you would know about it.
00:58:10 A pet shop?
00:58:11 No, not Petscop.
00:58:12 Petscop.
00:58:13 It's the game, right?
00:58:16 It is a YouTube channel slash video series that is a let's play.
00:58:24 It's a let's play of a fake game and it's sort of a creepy pot.
00:58:29 The videos and the game itself are both like...
00:58:32 Oh, I saw a game theory on this.
00:58:34 There is a game theory on it.
00:58:35 Recently I found another YouTube channel that talks about it called Nightmare Masterclass.
00:58:40 I have mixed feelings about Nightmare Masterclass, but I've been watching a bunch of it lately.
00:58:45 He has a big examination series on Petscop.
00:58:49 I just think that things like Petscop are really inspiring.
00:58:52 I love things that are...
00:58:54 It has such a novel format and that plays with the medium and stuff.
00:58:58 I think that kind of thing is so cool.
00:59:00 It's so fucking cool to me.
00:59:02 Completely agree and I want to talk about Petscop a lot.
00:59:04 However, I must just say that...
00:59:07 What is the name?
00:59:08 Nightmare Mastermind?
00:59:09 Masterclass.
00:59:10 Nightmare Masterclass.
00:59:11 Nightmare Masterclass.
00:59:12 There are so many Nightmind phony like fucking knockoffs on YouTube now.
00:59:18 For some reason it's just loaded as a medium.
00:59:21 I have never watched Nightmind and I don't think I want to.
00:59:26 Nightmare Masterclass.
00:59:28 Why exactly?
00:59:29 Not that I'm really...
00:59:31 Okay.
00:59:32 So I know.
00:59:33 I clicked like one Nightmind video thinking that I was going to be in for some sort of
00:59:39 like information dump or video essay or something and I remember there was like a...
00:59:43 I don't even remember what it was about.
00:59:45 I just remember I listened to it for 45 minutes the whole time thinking when is he going to
00:59:49 actually start talking about the topic and then the video ended.
00:59:53 Well, okay.
00:59:54 That's a very strange experience Ben because that's his entire thing is information dump
01:00:01 like down the rabbit hole ask explanation of ARGs.
01:00:04 Like that's what he does exclusively.
01:00:06 So I don't know what video you watched.
01:00:08 I don't know.
01:00:09 I don't know either.
01:00:10 It didn't impress me.
01:00:11 Okay.
01:00:12 Well.
01:00:13 But Nightmare...
01:00:14 Sounds like something I would like.
01:00:15 I want to see it.
01:00:16 Nightmare Masterclass.
01:00:17 He's very...
01:00:18 He will...
01:00:19 You know, sometimes I appreciate the spirit of like being willing to make like big logical
01:00:25 leaps and ask what if this means something even when it's something really innocuous and
01:00:30 maybe it doesn't mean anything at all.
01:00:32 It's probably like Preston Jacobs.
01:00:33 That guy isn't afraid to ask the tough questions.
01:00:35 He's not afraid to spend a wild layout of control.
01:00:38 He's not afraid to surmise that Quaith is bouncing telekinesis signals off the moon.
01:00:43 Indeed.
01:00:44 Indeed.
01:00:45 Oh man.
01:00:46 That reminds me because I just...
01:00:48 I watched the fucking Alex Jones on Joe Rogan podcast.
01:00:51 It's a good one.
01:00:52 It's a good one.
01:00:53 It was so good.
01:00:54 I haven't seen that one.
01:00:55 Oh my God.
01:00:56 Alex goes off the rail.
01:00:57 I don't know if he's like this every day.
01:00:58 Alex, he is.
01:00:59 All right, but it's so funny.
01:01:00 It's so funny.
01:01:01 I honestly...
01:01:02 That does sound funny.
01:01:03 The only Joe Rogan podcast I've watched is the Andrew Yang one as a matter of fact.
01:01:07 Fair enough.
01:01:08 The fucking...
01:01:09 But it was good and I liked it.
01:01:10 The fucking...
01:01:11 What's his name?
01:01:12 The Alex Jones episode is five hours long.
01:01:15 Yeah.
01:01:16 I enjoyed every minute of it and I am now a fan of Alex Jones.
01:01:19 Dude, Alex is so...
01:01:20 Oh boy.
01:01:21 Entertaining.
01:01:22 He's so...
01:01:23 Like you just have to be like this is obviously bullshit.
01:01:25 And it's so funny.
01:01:26 Even...
01:01:27 I don't even find that much of what he says to be that crazy.
01:01:31 Oh God.
01:01:32 He talks about interdimensional elves, specifically literally interdimensional.
01:01:36 Like when he talks about...
01:01:37 The clockwork elves.
01:01:38 You gotta kill the clockwork elves.
01:01:40 It's just that some of the things he says, when Joe says like, okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
01:01:44 you need to explain what that is, then he like elaborates and it actually is not as insane.
01:01:49 Right.
01:01:50 But it's...
01:01:51 What he uses up front is just it blasts you with this information that obviously seems
01:01:55 ridiculous.
01:01:56 He's the one who says they're putting chemicals in the water and turning the frogs gay, right?
01:02:00 Okay, that's a great example because the thing is, he's literally not even totally incorrect
01:02:05 because what he's specifically referring to is that there is a documented chemical that
01:02:09 was released into specific water bodies in America, I forget why, but what it did was
01:02:14 it increased, I think it was actually like hermaphroditic mutations in frogs.
01:02:19 So while it's not fair to say that it's turning them gay...
01:02:22 That is in fact wrong, man.
01:02:24 Well, the point is that the way Alex Jones talks...
01:02:28 It's basically completely wrong.
01:02:29 No, listen, the way he talks, the way he explains things is he gets a piece of information that
01:02:35 is crazy and is true and he has lots of these things that he talks about are verifiable
01:02:40 and when they are, he'll say like, go Google it, you know, you Google it, you find out
01:02:45 this fucking insane thing he said is true, but he will phrase it in a weird, somewhat
01:02:51 hyperbolic way and also he will extrapolate on it into trying to understand, but at the
01:02:59 same time, in this Joe Rogan podcast, there's a very clear self-awareness about the fact.
01:03:06 First of all, he constantly says things like, I might be retarded or like, I'm very autistic,
01:03:13 I'm kind of socially retarded, like he'll say things like that, right?
01:03:18 And in the meantime, he also says things like, you know, I don't mean literally, like he
01:03:26 keeps referring to aliens, but then he explains that he's like, aliens just means anything
01:03:31 that is like, not inherently from this world.
01:03:34 So he talks about, for instance, human chimeras, right, which are real, there are real experiments
01:03:41 on human chimeras that were done on like the, they were only done on like a stem cell level,
01:03:49 but like there are, there's not like real like human animal hybrids walking around.
01:03:54 Your brain thinks of like a giant wolf with a human head or something, I just think of
01:04:00 Nina.
01:04:01 That is the totality of his, I mean, in this moment where he breaks down that he doesn't,
01:04:07 like when he, when he says like, yeah, there's human chimeras, and then they look it up.
01:04:11 And yes, there is a thing that happened.
01:04:13 It's just not as extreme as it sounds, but it is not necessarily inaccurate to say that
01:04:19 they are human chimeras, what he's describing.
01:04:21 But then he goes on to say that like, those are aliens, because they are not something
01:04:27 that naturally occurred on earth.
01:04:29 So he considers it an alien species.
01:04:32 So when he talks about aliens, he's talking about anything that falls under this huge
01:04:36 category of what he considers aliens, you know?
01:04:39 So basically Alex Jones says the wrong words, and that's why people get confused.
01:04:43 It's kind of, it's that he, he's trying to explain something that there's not necessarily
01:04:49 words for.
01:04:51 And so he's making up whatever comes to his mind and trying to explain it.
01:04:56 And then if you talk to him long enough, you can kind of extrapolate back and figure out
01:05:00 what he's really talking about, and you go, oh, okay, you're just talking about this.
01:05:04 Oh, all right.
01:05:05 But yeah, that is a, there is a, because I mean, there is a lot of crazy things going
01:05:10 on in the world, a lot of weird, you know, things that are being kept under wraps, things
01:05:14 that are, uh, that are, you know, conspiratorial and like, there is some element of he's sincerely
01:05:21 exploring these things, he's sincerely questioning and like trying to get to the heart of the
01:05:26 matter, but he is an insane person.
01:05:29 I mean, so the way he, the results he comes away with just sound like insane ravings, but
01:05:34 you also have to look at it and go, okay, well, I at least can get that nugget of intrigue
01:05:39 out of it, that nugget of what is real and is identifiable in what he's saying, and then
01:05:44 try to come up with like my own take on it, you know, as opposed to trying to like, at
01:05:48 some point I can switch off the Alex Jones, the vacation of the information and like consider
01:05:53 it for myself.
01:05:54 Um, but the stuff he talks about is fairly interesting.
01:05:57 Like the stuff that is real is all crazy fucking shit that you're like, oh my God, that's real.
01:06:01 I would make the argument that Alex Jones ladens the whatever truth he has in such levels
01:06:08 of extrapolation hyperbole that it, I would make the argument that it is not worth my
01:06:14 time to try to discern true fiction.
01:06:16 That's very fair.
01:06:17 The only thing that makes it that makes it worth my time is that he's so fucking entertaining.
01:06:21 Well, that's like, he's just going, he doesn't stop.
01:06:24 He just gets more intense.
01:06:25 He gets more raw and like he also, he keeps saying throughout the podcast, like I've
01:06:30 got Alzheimer's already, but like, and he doesn't mean it, but there's definitely something
01:06:35 wrong with the man's brain.
01:06:37 Like he will lose track.
01:06:39 There's moments where he just seems to completely not know where he is anymore.
01:06:43 Like he like, is it, he's ranting so fervently that he just kind of is like out of breath
01:06:47 and he's like, what was I talking about again?
01:06:49 Like I, I don't even, I don't even know what the fuck's going on anymore.
01:06:52 And for a good long while, he demanded that every Eddie Bravo choke him out and make him
01:06:57 pass out on the episode.
01:06:58 He just, and like, dude, and after a little while, he was like, can we stop being pussies?
01:07:07 Can you just jump in the back when he was in school?
01:07:13 Like everybody used to choke each other at his school to get high or something.
01:07:16 Yeah, they would all just choke each other all the time, which I've heard.
01:07:20 I've heard a weird shit to get high, man.
01:07:22 I used to know kids used to like, that sounds like the kind of thing that will give you
01:07:27 brain damage.
01:07:28 I used to hear about kids taking a deep breath and crouching down, jumping up, exhaling
01:07:32 and smacking themselves in the forehead all at once.
01:07:36 And it just kills some of your brain cells and makes you feel kind of high for a second.
01:07:41 Great.
01:07:42 Great.
01:07:43 See, we should definitely get Alex Jones on this podcast.
01:07:46 Yeah, we should get him on.
01:07:47 He's looking for a platform.
01:07:48 I would love it.
01:07:49 Oh, I can't wait for the Munchie Alex Jones crossover.
01:07:51 Oh, that's what we were all saying too.
01:07:53 We were like, oh, imagine Munchie and Alex Jones in the same room.
01:07:55 Just it would be so great.
01:07:58 Just guess it vibe.
01:08:00 That'd be a great episode of the Pleeve and the Weave.
01:08:03 That's true.
01:08:05 It would just be nonstop.
01:08:06 Have you seen there's there's one clip on YouTube that some it's Alex Jones.
01:08:11 So this wasn't intentional.
01:08:12 It's just a clip from him on his first appearance and Joe Rogan, I think.
01:08:14 And it's just Alex Jones explains the plot of Evangelion and then purely
01:08:20 basically by accident, he details how he interprets like the modern political and
01:08:25 like technological landscape about breakaway societies and whatnot.
01:08:29 And that's it's literally silly.
01:08:31 OK, literally like the what's called the in the Joe Rogan episode.
01:08:36 It's like everything he describes is the plot of something like it's all
01:08:41 it all sci-fi.
01:08:42 It's all relatable to something.
01:08:43 It's all like speculative fiction.
01:08:45 Like it's it's clear from that podcast that he is very well read.
01:08:49 Like he's read a lot of futurism texts and shit and like seen tons of sci-fi.
01:08:56 And like the way he just throws out terminology like very, you know,
01:09:01 casually sounds like somebody talking about sci-fi, like talking about an anime or something.
01:09:06 And like I remember several times that he was just like describing plots of shows
01:09:10 that I was like, oh, my God, that's isn't that just
01:09:14 yeah, like Eva or Lane, especially.
01:09:16 Yeah, yeah, that too.
01:09:19 There is a channel called Art House Politics, which is somewhat
01:09:24 I don't know, it may be divisive to the fans of the show.
01:09:28 However, I think it's really funny and crazy.
01:09:31 And I love it.
01:09:32 And they have a video that is I'm going to link it.
01:09:37 It's going to be in the show notes, hopefully.
01:09:39 I'll just explain the world as a whole.
01:09:40 It's just a clip of Alex Jones, which he has laid in visuals over
01:09:44 in a in a in a very humorous way.
01:09:47 And this is the video that I think about whenever I think about Alex Jones.
01:09:51 Who loves to watch this.
01:09:52 Like he talks in such circles that like having an infographic
01:09:56 trying to like illustrate what he's communicating is harder than you would imagine.
01:10:01 Like like one of the claims that he'll make a lot is he'll just say he'll just throw out there.
01:10:05 There's at least 12 dimensions.
01:10:07 And I'm like, but the thing is he's talking about like string theory.
01:10:10 He'll say he'll say at least 12 dimensions, 10 proven.
01:10:14 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
01:10:16 Wait, is he talking about that like 10?
01:10:18 You know that YouTube video that he's definitely talking about that?
01:10:22 Yeah, that's that's not just one video, by the way.
01:10:24 That's a guy's entire channel that has hundreds of videos.
01:10:27 Yeah, but there's like the one that started it.
01:10:30 Yeah, well, the one that that's the funny thing about the 10 dimensions thing
01:10:33 is that if you just watch the one original video, you're like, OK,
01:10:37 cool, sounds reasonable.
01:10:38 Then you see that the guy has like hundreds of hours of explaining
01:10:42 that same point and it no longer seems reasonable anymore.
01:10:45 That's interesting.
01:10:47 Weird. OK.
01:10:49 Um, why does he so why does Alex Jones say 12 dimensions, 10 proven?
01:10:54 And what what's he getting at?
01:10:56 Who the fuck knows?
01:10:57 I don't know.
01:10:57 Well, where's the nugget of truth, Digi?
01:10:59 Where's the nugget of truth?
01:11:01 Oh, well, I mean, I guess the nugget of truth is that there's
01:11:03 possibly multiple dimensions.
01:11:05 I mean, like the main thing that that resonated with me about Joe Rogan's
01:11:09 whole spiel is this idea that he seems to think similarly to how I do
01:11:16 that like humans are all we're basically trying to, you know, escape
01:11:20 entropy, make it to the next sort of exit the dimension that we are in
01:11:24 or achieve achieve awareness of a higher dimension so that we are not limited
01:11:29 to the one that's, you know, this universe that's coming to an end, so to speak.
01:11:34 And this he knows that's not what these dimensions are, right?
01:11:37 These aren't like planes of existence that one can move between.
01:11:41 No, the fourth dimension time or something.
01:11:43 Yes, the fourth dimension.
01:11:44 I don't remember the time.
01:11:45 I don't remember the details of the ten dimensional thing, but it's something like that.
01:11:49 There was a lot of talk of DMT and how it like allows you to access
01:11:53 the fourth dimension potentially.
01:11:55 This is crazy shit.
01:11:58 See, I don't get down with that too much.
01:12:00 But then again, I've never tried.
01:12:01 So I got to try DMT.
01:12:03 I got to do it.
01:12:04 Everyone says I have to do it.
01:12:06 Well, your oh, it's your brain.
01:12:07 Yeah.
01:12:08 Before you die, here's cancer.
01:12:10 I learned that the other day.
01:12:11 Well, that's good.
01:12:13 But did you know that bank here is retardation?
01:12:15 Oh, yeah.
01:12:15 Oh, I'm talking it right now.
01:12:17 It's not working, though.
01:12:19 It's not working.
01:12:20 I need to chug faster.
01:12:21 It's not taking effect.
01:12:23 Let's talk.
01:12:24 Let's talk about.
01:12:24 All right.
01:12:25 So you discovered this energy drink called bang that I want to find.
01:12:30 I'm going to try and find it in seven.
01:12:31 Better be quick because I don't know if it'll be around forever.
01:12:35 Oh, did you just you just happened to have been contacted
01:12:38 in like the attempt to get you to like help take down big bang.
01:12:43 Like big, big pharma.
01:12:44 Yeah.
01:12:45 Yeah, and apparently there's claims.
01:12:48 There's like it's being sued by a bunch of people
01:12:50 because it makes a bunch of claims, including but not limited to
01:12:53 that it cures retardation.
01:12:54 Yeah.
01:12:55 OK, OK.
01:12:55 All right.
01:12:55 Well, here's the history of bang
01:12:57 because this is an extremely long drawn out issue that is so
01:13:02 that there truly is a big bang of information.
01:13:04 This is exploded out in the past couple of days.
01:13:06 This is this is being covered in the news.
01:13:08 This is crazy.
01:13:09 This is what we're going on right now.
01:13:11 So I get back from a trip to Boston and I go to my local 7-Eleven
01:13:16 for the energy drink run, which I always virtually do every single night.
01:13:21 And I go there and I see next to the monster.
01:13:25 I see a new kind of look.
01:13:26 I see bang, super creatine, potent brain and body fuel.
01:13:31 And now if you will indulge me, I just want to read the label,
01:13:34 which is on the back of every single bank bottle,
01:13:36 which is what compelled me to try out a few of the distinct and odd flavors.
01:13:42 So bang, potent brain and body fuel.
01:13:45 Make no mistake.
01:13:46 Bang is not your stereotypical high sugar, life-sucking soda,
01:13:51 masquerade as an energy drink.
01:13:52 High sugar drinks spike blood pressure levels, producing metabolic mayhem,
01:13:57 causing you to crash harder than a test dummy into a brick wall.
01:14:01 Power up with bangs, potent brain and body rocking fuel.
01:14:05 Creatine caffeine, COQ, 10 and BACs, branch chain amino acids.
01:14:12 Life is an extreme sport and bang is the extreme energy source to live life extreme.
01:14:19 All three of those extremes are spelled without an E, so it's extreme.
01:14:24 And then there's a TM at the end.
01:14:26 You had to be 18 years or older.
01:14:28 Wait, do they each have a TM?
01:14:29 Yes.
01:14:32 They couldn't have trademarked extreme, right?
01:14:35 No, no, no, I'm saying the end of that.
01:14:39 Life is an extreme sport is tiered.
01:14:42 OK, OK, gotcha.
01:14:43 That's a little better.
01:14:44 It's not much better.
01:14:45 Zero zero carbs, zero sugars, zero calories, zero artificial colorings.
01:14:50 And I am patient.
01:14:51 What's in the number?
01:14:52 I'm patient number, I believe eight million, eight point five million.
01:14:57 I'm patient eight point five.
01:14:58 Do they actually say a patient number?
01:15:00 Yes. What is that about?
01:15:02 That's hilarious.
01:15:03 Like this is the one that's killing you, the eight millionth bangs produced.
01:15:08 Right. So it's to be almost like a like a doctor,
01:15:11 like like it's making some medicinal claims.
01:15:13 It seems well, it is.
01:15:14 It says that it reverses retardation.
01:15:17 Yeah, it seems like this drink needs a disclaimer on it.
01:15:21 Like this product is not meant to diagnose or cure any disease or really retardation.
01:15:25 Be simply, but it doesn't just it doesn't say cure.
01:15:28 Retardation says reverse mental retardation.
01:15:31 I feel I feel like it's definitely like a funny joke.
01:15:34 You'll actually be smarter than a regular person.
01:15:36 I just didn't think people would take.
01:15:37 No, it seems reverse retardation in the sense of the more retarded you are now,
01:15:42 it will flip the script and you'll be even more intelligent.
01:15:44 Once you drink this thing, it will, you'll have reverse retardation.
01:15:47 Right, right.
01:15:48 Hold on, this, the bottle.
01:15:51 OK, I am intrigued by the bottle and there are some numerous strange flavors.
01:15:56 Just as a cotton candy flavor, which I purchased.
01:16:00 This cotton candy flavored energy drink, I get it, tastes pretty good, actually.
01:16:06 Tastes kind of strange, actually, not really like monsters I've had.
01:16:10 It's it's carbonated, but very mildly carbonated.
01:16:14 It kind of tastes like a water, but just has an extremely, extremely
01:16:20 potent, unbelievably potent, like they put too much serum in it.
01:16:25 Con candy flavor, so I'm intrigued by this odd delicacy,
01:16:30 which I am partaking in, and then begins my stumble down the bang rabbit hole.
01:16:36 And I just became a fanatic for this energy drink after navigating
01:16:39 to their official website.
01:16:41 If you care to join me, bang dash energy dot com.
01:16:45 And you'll be confronted with sites unknown.
01:16:49 Dude, you're going to be studying more colors than you borrowed for.
01:16:51 I want a pair of bang kicks.
01:16:53 So fuck yeah.
01:16:54 Yeah, OK, OK, OK, so they don't have just bang, nor do they have just other,
01:16:59 you know, you know, this bag is marketed semi as a workout thing.
01:17:03 So they have, you know, protein powder and, you know, keto coffee.
01:17:07 They don't even have just drinks, delicacies, though.
01:17:10 They have a peril that commercials.
01:17:13 They have healthy keto recipes so you can make your own queue.
01:17:16 Delicacies using the protein powder at various points in the recipe.
01:17:19 They have events.
01:17:21 They have a whole ton of YouTube videos.
01:17:24 They have the bang anti diet, rapid body remodeling blast fat fast
01:17:30 with the CEO, Jack, like literally Jack.
01:17:34 Oh, whoa, spelled like, oh, whoa.
01:17:37 With a C at the end.
01:17:38 A walk, a walk, a walk, a walk, a walk, Jack, a walk.
01:17:43 So I so the the intrigue to me about this, I received an email
01:17:48 and I've seen the bang energy in stores.
01:17:50 I've seen I've also seen some of the other stuff by the company
01:17:53 because it's by a company called VPX Sports who does like all kinds of energy
01:17:57 drinks, they also do red line is another thing you can buy.
01:18:01 Yeah, I'd heard of I just linked to their protein drink, protein rush.
01:18:06 And they also had what was the fucking bar that I've seen at the store?
01:18:09 Oh, the zero impact bars.
01:18:11 Well, apparently, so I got an email from just someone out of nowhere.
01:18:16 The email is called campaign opportunity about false advertising.
01:18:20 It says, I'm writing to see if you're interested in working with us
01:18:23 on a campaign to help prioritize the case with the FDA.
01:18:26 Bang Energy has eight active lawsuits due to false advertising and marketing.
01:18:29 Check out the truth about bang.com to learn more.
01:18:34 I'm sure you can think of some real interesting things to talk about
01:18:36 once you visit the website.
01:18:37 If you would like to participate in this campaign to help spread the truth
01:18:40 and prioritize this case with the FDA, please apply here and let us know what it
01:18:43 would cost to collaborate. So what the fuck?
01:18:46 So these people are offering me money to help spread the word
01:18:50 about the FDA case against bang energy,
01:18:55 which I don't know.
01:18:57 I don't know why I would get contacted about this.
01:19:00 Yeah, I don't know if I'm just if it's just random,
01:19:02 this guy is just emailing everybody with a fucking platform on earth or what?
01:19:06 But if you go to the truth about bang.com,
01:19:08 it's basically just about how they've made all these false claims
01:19:11 about the energy drink, such as that it contains an enhanced form of creatine.
01:19:15 Not true as a patent on super creatine.
01:19:18 Not true can reverse mental retardation, cure Alzheimer's disease,
01:19:23 Parkinson's, Huntington's, other forms of dementia.
01:19:27 Yeah. Yeah.
01:19:28 But at the bottom of the page, it says, don't get bang boozled.
01:19:32 America is noticing.
01:19:34 I've been banged.
01:19:36 Fucking sneakers.
01:19:38 Frequently in what is it?
01:19:40 Defeat bang. Is it the truth about the truth about bang?
01:19:43 The truth about bang.com.
01:19:44 Yeah. There are videos from the CEO
01:19:48 Jack, which I don't know why all CEOs are named Jack now,
01:19:51 but that's just how it is.
01:19:52 Yeah, that's what they do.
01:19:54 So if you also want to mose on over to VPX sports on YouTube,
01:20:00 I will also link that here.
01:20:02 They have a lot of videos dedicated to bang, many of which featuring Jack.
01:20:07 And let me just say Jack is my personal hero
01:20:13 and someone who I look up quite a bit.
01:20:16 He is quite the intense frantic man.
01:20:20 Almost Alex Jones, which depends on the video.
01:20:23 Sometimes I think he hasn't
01:20:24 drank in a bang before recording, but in many he has.
01:20:27 And he has a he has a this is going to sound strange.
01:20:30 I would describe him as like a mixture
01:20:32 between Alex Jones and Butch Hartman, a fairly odd parents name.
01:20:36 That's kind of does he display all the outward symptoms of reverse retardation?
01:20:41 I think he has an IQ well into the triple digits.
01:20:44 Well, OK, great.
01:20:49 So I I got really down this.
01:20:51 This is like a weird coincidence, right?
01:20:54 Digi, that we're both like now entangled in the bang.
01:20:57 Yeah, totally.
01:20:59 Independent of one another.
01:21:00 Yeah, yeah, that's crazy.
01:21:02 So if you want, I will select some some videos for your enjoyment.
01:21:06 But needless to say, this YouTube channel is
01:21:08 a shuck full of great parody level videos
01:21:12 and commercials advertising bang as if it were like a joke.
01:21:16 Yeah, I'm looking at it.
01:21:18 Digi, please don't take down Big Bang
01:21:20 until I've tried that cotton candy.
01:21:22 I'm inclined to think that this might have even been inspired by Alex Jones,
01:21:27 who is by a supplement shill.
01:21:29 Like that's what he does. Yeah, that's true.
01:21:31 Because looking at these, it's like it's the same set up of like guy
01:21:34 at a desk with a big expensive mic with a green screen background
01:21:38 that is probably just in his house.
01:21:40 And like, yeah, these videos are pretty hilarious.
01:21:47 Also, the the banner of the YouTube is just a bunch of chicks in bikinis,
01:21:52 but with just their tits and bellies.
01:21:56 No faces.
01:21:57 No, this is so blatantly, it has to be thick, right?
01:22:02 But then you can go to several of it and get your cotton candy flavored bang.
01:22:05 It's not a joke.
01:22:06 Yeah, to be fair, this might be pointing to their sculpted abdomens.
01:22:11 You know, I'm looking at the website.
01:22:12 I'm looking at the Rainbow Unicorn Fitness Collection.
01:22:15 It's nice. It's like, well, these are these are keto, by the way.
01:22:18 They have the meltdown keto caffeine free.
01:22:21 How to make a keto pumpkin cheesecake?
01:22:23 Yeah, there's a ton of keto recipes on the YouTube channel.
01:22:26 Yeah, this is good.
01:22:28 Older, you know, Ben, it sounds like.
01:22:30 And I mean, their clothes look like they would be in Endless War.
01:22:34 So clearly, they do.
01:22:35 Clearly, bang needs to be the official energy drink of Endless War.
01:22:40 Wait, I. OK, but I'm going to post a picture.
01:22:44 Look at this.
01:22:45 They're they're advertising. They're advertising slime.
01:22:48 Here we go. Bam.
01:22:51 This is what they want.
01:22:52 This is what they want us all to be consuming.
01:22:54 Smoothie bowl. That's literally slime.
01:22:56 They're just repurposing slime.
01:22:58 The colors like slime.
01:23:00 That's fucking funny.
01:23:02 You know, you know, Nate, can you can you let us know the inside?
01:23:05 Is Jack Owowick also the CEO of Slime Corp?
01:23:09 I, you know, number one, the N1 doesn't like us to talk about his personal affairs.
01:23:12 So I can't I can't, you know, that's not relevant to our discussion right here.
01:23:17 There's a there's a there's a lot of our
01:23:18 layoffs of security you got to go through before you get a.
01:23:20 What's the connection about the big man?
01:23:22 What's the connection between Andrew Bang and Jack Owow?
01:23:25 No, no, no, no, no.
01:23:26 Oh, my God, there's Andrew Gang.
01:23:28 There's Andrew Bang.
01:23:29 They're going to go head to head real soon.
01:23:32 Andrew, Andrew Gang is just Andrew Yang's body on top of Jack Owowick, by the way.
01:23:37 It's Andrew Yang's body with with a Jack Owow's brain put into it.
01:23:42 It's OK. A thousand miles per hour.
01:23:44 Oh, it's like 120 FPS.
01:23:46 I don't know what's specifically keto about any of this stuff,
01:23:49 other than the fact that it's low carb, but whatever.
01:23:53 Well, they had some some specifically keto drink on the side, I guess.
01:23:57 Yeah. But I don't know what is I don't know what is keto about it.
01:24:02 Like, pretty much the only thing about keto is that it is having low carbs.
01:24:05 Yeah, you can probably make that claim about lots of stuff.
01:24:08 I'm sure I'm sure water is keto.
01:24:09 You know, like just probably make the same claim about Monster Ultra, for example.
01:24:14 Yeah, there you go.
01:24:16 Or like literally any diet drink.
01:24:18 Yeah, or water. Yeah.
01:24:20 Water, for example.
01:24:21 Highly keto.
01:24:23 God, this bang rainbow unicorn just looks so cool.
01:24:26 Bangster berry killers.
01:24:28 Fuck purple and white and black.
01:24:31 Got to get me some.
01:24:32 I've been marketed to you so effectively.
01:24:34 I'm going to staff my suitcase with bangs
01:24:37 and I'm going to bring it next time I come to Boston.
01:24:39 And you're going to be able to try some.
01:24:41 I'm going to smuggle you some. Don't worry.
01:24:43 We're going to sell this one for all.
01:24:46 I should just walk to Davis Square and just just I just got to be like,
01:24:49 hey, Mr. Mr. 711, Mr.
01:24:51 Mr. Dr. 711 CEO of 711 Corporation.
01:24:55 You got any bang for me? Thanks.
01:24:57 I bet they do. I hope so.
01:24:59 Please, God. Maybe you get your own.
01:25:01 Maybe, maybe.
01:25:03 Anyway, so bang is is an endless joy.
01:25:06 Just just navigate their website.
01:25:07 Look at all of the crazy shit they have on display here.
01:25:10 All the stuff that you can buy.
01:25:11 There's so many.
01:25:13 There's so much. It's a lifestyle brand is what it is.
01:25:15 It is.
01:25:16 Do they utilize the phrase bang for your buck anyway?
01:25:19 No, I don't think so.
01:25:21 No, these are extremely expensive.
01:25:23 You don't want to be thinking about that.
01:25:25 They are extreme. Why are they so much money?
01:25:28 OK, at 711, they're like a normal drink, right?
01:25:32 They're a normal drink.
01:25:33 But these are like $50 for a 12 pack.
01:25:37 Some of them are insane.
01:25:38 Some of them are insanely expensive,
01:25:40 and some of them are just a little expensive.
01:25:43 They they there's like no real like pattern to how they're priced.
01:25:47 Just like the weird the weirder ones cost more.
01:25:50 Maybe I don't know.
01:25:51 Maybe they're hard to manufacture something like that.
01:25:53 Maybe like the keto coffee ones are more expensive
01:25:56 than just the 12 pack of the cotton candy.
01:25:59 Like the newer the newer flavors just cost like double.
01:26:01 I think some of these are like $96 for a 12 pack
01:26:04 for some of like to highly specialized ones.
01:26:06 What the fuck? That's insane.
01:26:08 It's a racket, right?
01:26:09 Bang variety, 12 pack, $31.99.
01:26:12 And that's not crazy.
01:26:13 That's I guess that's fine.
01:26:15 All right, I've had enough fucking bang.
01:26:18 Yeah, yeah, move on to.
01:26:19 Hey, hey, clip clip that clip at everyone.
01:26:22 Clip clip saying did you doesn't want any more.
01:26:23 I just want to say I just got a hilarious
01:26:26 OK, so I got to say whatever.
01:26:27 You know how with with the T-Bap stuff,
01:26:31 I never once on T-Bap ever linked best guy ever stuff
01:26:34 up to this very day.
01:26:35 The first time I ever did was yesterday
01:26:37 with T-Bap resurrection at the very end said like,
01:26:40 hey, look what Kagan fans were up to.
01:26:41 And I linked our channels.
01:26:43 I just I just saw of a first comment.
01:26:46 It's on my Gernlog and part two review.
01:26:48 It's a proto gen solace with a pony avatar
01:26:53 just saying this is such a good fucking video.
01:26:55 Holy shit.
01:26:56 We've got the crossover that's been achieved at long last.
01:27:00 Hell, yeah.
01:27:01 There was at least one subscriber to mine there.
01:27:03 I already I already I already I already I already I already
01:27:06 T-Bap comments like, yeah,
01:27:07 surprise that they knew best guy ever and kickstand it,
01:27:12 but they didn't make the connection until just the people do that.
01:27:15 I don't understand how it.
01:27:17 I had already cashed that check
01:27:20 because when I started this Pokemon Sunnuz lock,
01:27:22 I announced it on on TV.
01:27:24 All right.
01:27:25 I never had I already got a whole girlfriend out of that video.
01:27:29 Oh, God, I mean, frankly, Michelle was a fan of T-Bap as well.
01:27:35 And so I mean, we met much later, like during Mia Maffova.
01:27:39 But it was originally with T-Bap.
01:27:42 Michelle Watch was a fan of I mean, I guess she must figure out
01:27:45 that you existed. I suppose I believe her.
01:27:49 But, you know, suspect it is very we got to open an investigation.
01:27:53 I think she might be a spy from Big Bang.
01:27:59 She does love her energy drinks.
01:28:00 All right. Not every episode has to be two and a half hours, guys.
01:28:04 Yeah, I mean, I'm going to go to to voicemails.
01:28:07 We might want to go to voicemails.
01:28:08 Yeah. OK. Yeah, I'm for that.
01:28:10 All right. I say, let's do it.
01:28:13 I mean, we go to voicemails proper.
01:28:15 We've got to check in with our with our current people
01:28:18 investigating the elusive pizza party podcast.
01:28:22 I don't have the I don't have the sound to queued up the intro music, whatever.
01:28:25 Come on. I tweeted I tweeted at Rebel Taxi.
01:28:29 Oh, I saw that. Yeah.
01:28:31 And I included an ill he's he's mysteriously silent on suspicious.
01:28:37 I'd say very, very suspicious.
01:28:39 I was not here for this whole saga.
01:28:41 Can someone explain to me what's happening?
01:28:43 You don't you know, you don't know.
01:28:44 Really? You miss the whole thing?
01:28:45 That's what we're investigating the whereabouts of the podcast.
01:28:49 Yeah, the so called podcast.
01:28:52 It is it is ongoing yet to be found.
01:28:55 The answers are just not forthcoming.
01:28:57 But you know, the whole hashtag.
01:28:59 Where's the podcast?
01:29:01 No one can find it. There's no clues.
01:29:03 Where's the podcast? No one knows.
01:29:05 Understood. OK, so let's go to it.
01:29:08 We've got someone reporting on the scene.
01:29:10 This is electronic warbear.
01:29:13 He's got some comments to say.
01:29:15 So let's hear from him. Go.
01:29:18 I've started my safari of the urban jungle of Atlanta.
01:29:23 And what is this?
01:29:25 A con for animation and gaming, Momo con.
01:29:30 And who is this special guesting at this con?
01:29:35 Why the pizza party podcast?
01:29:37 Oh, my God, I've begun my mission to find the podcast.
01:29:43 Yeah. Hashtag.
01:29:44 Fulls errands. Boots on the ground.
01:29:47 I appreciate it. Yeah, we've got it.
01:29:48 We've got my fucking vision when black after you said Momo.
01:29:52 And I just had I just started thinking about the Momo challenge
01:29:54 and how and how much of my failure I am for not finishing the Momo challenge.
01:29:58 Well, we've got a so we've got a soldier on the scene.
01:30:02 We've got a special agent.
01:30:03 Frankly, I fear for his well being. Me too.
01:30:05 I mean, when he discovers that it's all a sham.
01:30:08 Oh, I'm sure they'll show up.
01:30:09 I'm sure some some agents, some blank faced, you know, glassy eyed agents
01:30:13 will show up to this quote unquote pizza party podcast panel.
01:30:17 But we all know that it's all a facade below the service.
01:30:19 There is no podcast going on underneath there.
01:30:22 Why do they even have a fucking Momo con appearance?
01:30:24 They don't talk about anime.
01:30:26 Well, because they're they said it's like a cartoon or animation.
01:30:30 Con, I guess. I don't know.
01:30:31 There's no. Why is rebel?
01:30:32 Why is rebel taxis avatar so hideous and a bad?
01:30:36 It's just very abstract.
01:30:38 I don't know what it means or is it's awful.
01:30:41 I guys, I showed you the Toy Story.
01:30:44 Let's play it.
01:30:45 Red Con 3.5.
01:30:46 Yeah, indeed.
01:30:47 Indeed, which is pretty funny.
01:30:49 Yeah.
01:30:49 Have we that to the people or the people aware of that?
01:30:52 Because that is incredible.
01:30:53 I I mean, all that needs to be said is just watch the first episode of
01:30:58 toy pan pizzas Toy Story.
01:30:59 Let's play and just watch it to the end and trust me.
01:31:02 That's the first episode.
01:31:03 Yeah, this is your intro to this.
01:31:05 I can only imagine where it goes from the intro of the video.
01:31:10 It's clickety-clack down the track.
01:31:12 That's what he says to start out the episode.
01:31:14 And it goes so, so far downhill.
01:31:16 OK, you'll know.
01:31:17 You'll know when you hear that clicking and clacking.
01:31:19 OK, let's go to the actual voicemails here.
01:31:23 Oh, this is this is appropriate.
01:31:25 This first mail is from fuck the PPP.
01:31:27 Long live the PCP.
01:31:29 Hey, there we go.
01:31:30 Sounds good.
01:31:30 Yeah.
01:31:31 Yeah, we exist, bitches.
01:31:33 Commands.
01:31:35 So I just wanted to say that the last episode of the PCP was some.
01:31:38 Yeah, and I do not mean gay shit.
01:31:41 I mean, yeah.
01:31:44 OK, yeah.
01:31:45 First of all, Pokemon.
01:31:47 What the fuck is a Pikachu?
01:31:49 Second of all, you didn't play maintro.
01:31:52 Although the version by Ben and Nick was very nice.
01:31:55 Oh, sorry about that.
01:31:57 Capitalism.
01:31:58 Nate, why don't you come hang out in this slum?
01:32:03 Why don't you come to South America?
01:32:06 Literally home to Brazil.
01:32:08 And to call the money from.
01:32:10 Why don't you get some perspective?
01:32:12 Lots of all, what the fuck is going on with the editor contest?
01:32:15 You know, I want to make some money.
01:32:17 Oh, yeah.
01:32:17 Get out of this fucking awful place.
01:32:20 There is Argentina.
01:32:22 But I can't if I use fuckers don't say that I won't.
01:32:26 I want the contest.
01:32:27 I won't.
01:32:28 I won't.
01:32:31 How do you fix a party podcast?
01:32:33 Well, thank you.
01:32:34 Appreciate that.
01:32:35 I'm glad I said that.
01:32:37 I put that in.
01:32:37 I just wanted to say, hey, everybody who's
01:32:39 waiting to hear back about the editor contest,
01:32:41 we're still voting and deliberating.
01:32:43 You will hear back.
01:32:43 So we haven't forgot.
01:32:45 Obviously, it's high priority.
01:32:46 I've already cussed my judgment.
01:32:47 Indeed, most of us have.
01:32:49 Listen, I edited the last episode,
01:32:52 and it ruined my whole week.
01:32:53 It was a nightmare.
01:32:54 I hated it.
01:32:54 I'm never doing it again.
01:32:55 I'm so fucking eager to pick a winner
01:32:58 and never edit another podcast.
01:33:00 Well, that's great, Ben, because I
01:33:01 think you're one of the people we're
01:33:02 waiting to hear from in terms of your votes.
01:33:04 OK, yeah, I should.
01:33:06 OK, I'll send you the list.
01:33:07 I've got the list.
01:33:08 My B. OK, all right.
01:33:10 I have to do it, too, so I'm dragging ass.
01:33:12 OK, next one, let me see.
01:33:14 This voicemail here is from Arith Dyes.
01:33:18 I notice he says, Arith, not Arith.
01:33:20 I appreciate that.
01:33:22 Go.
01:33:23 OK, I've been playing Final Fantasy VII,
01:33:26 and I just realized that, like, Arith fucking dies.
01:33:29 And I'm at that point, and that happened.
01:33:31 And like, do you get her back?
01:33:33 Or is she dead forever?
01:33:34 What the fuck?
01:33:36 Oh, I love that music.
01:33:37 I grinded her levels of shit.
01:33:39 She's gone now.
01:33:40 What the fuck?
01:33:41 I want her back.
01:33:42 Ah!
01:33:43 Is this one of those things where it's like he's known
01:33:46 forever that Arith dies, but when it actually happens,
01:33:49 he's like, oh, she actually died.
01:33:52 Yeah, like, I actually spent like 20 hours grinding her levels.
01:33:54 I just thought this was a meme.
01:33:56 Yeah.
01:33:57 You knew she was going to die.
01:33:59 Why didn't you?
01:34:01 Why didn't you just not grind her?
01:34:02 Why didn't you prepare yourself?
01:34:04 I mean, to be fair, that's it's.
01:34:06 He didn't think they would actually do it, the Madman.
01:34:07 It's kind of like that argument that's like, you know,
01:34:10 like, if you think that ex-mechanic is in a game,
01:34:14 is overpowered, then just don't use the mechanic, bro.
01:34:17 Like, impose your own difficulty challenges.
01:34:19 Like, I would argue it is a, look, I mean,
01:34:22 I love that Arith's died.
01:34:23 That's dope.
01:34:23 But it is technically kind of like a flaw
01:34:26 that you can invest time and resources grinding a character
01:34:28 only to have them removed.
01:34:29 What do you mean it's tech?
01:34:31 I don't know.
01:34:32 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
01:34:33 No, it's not a flaw.
01:34:34 It can be annoying.
01:34:35 It's a good thing.
01:34:36 It's literally a good thing because you have more
01:34:39 than a story reason to care about Arith.
01:34:41 You know, that's true.
01:34:42 Yeah.
01:34:42 For story sense, that's true.
01:34:43 You have a gameplay reason.
01:34:44 I'm just saying, like, if you just say on a gameplay side
01:34:48 alone, and you spend a much time grinding a character,
01:34:49 especially if you played the first time, you don't know.
01:34:51 Oh, that adds to it.
01:34:52 Well, imagine if in the remake they made it so that all
01:34:55 of her XP goes to your other characters when she dies.
01:34:58 I don't even want that.
01:34:59 I don't even want that.
01:35:00 I mean, you could complain about it.
01:35:02 Someone might not like it.
01:35:04 That doesn't make it a flaw.
01:35:05 OK, fair enough.
01:35:06 I guess it kind of depends on your perspective,
01:35:08 but OK, I get the point.
01:35:10 OK, now actually, I'll fucking fight.
01:35:12 I'll fucking fight someone criticizing that,
01:35:14 because that's great.
01:35:15 It's just great.
01:35:16 Totally hippo.
01:35:16 Yeah, hippo.
01:35:17 You're right.
01:35:18 You're invested.
01:35:19 You're invested because you work.
01:35:20 Yeah, that's true.
01:35:20 It feels like a real loss, especially if you fucking got
01:35:23 her fourth level limit, which you can get by that point,
01:35:24 even though it's hard, but whatever.
01:35:26 By the way, next voicemail is from, I think
01:35:30 it's senior, sad, and depressed.
01:35:32 It's like SR period, so I assume it's senior.
01:35:35 Maybe it's senior?
01:35:36 I don't know.
01:35:37 But this is another one about loss.
01:35:40 SR period definitely means senior.
01:35:43 Does it?
01:35:43 OK, senior, sad, it's senior.
01:35:45 It would go at the end of a word, because like the opposite
01:35:49 of junior.
01:35:50 It's at the beginning.
01:35:50 I choose to pick senior.
01:35:52 I think it's senior.
01:35:53 Maybe it's senator.
01:35:56 Oh, it might be.
01:35:58 OK, let's hear what you have to say, sir.
01:36:02 Hang on, it's loading.
01:36:04 There it goes.
01:36:04 Mr. Sander, please.
01:36:06 Mr. Best Man, in all times you mention girl and log in,
01:36:10 please explain why in all the videos
01:36:12 that I've watched before now, where you've done so,
01:36:15 you never once said that Simone's brother is Kamina.
01:36:20 So I was thinking like, oh, you know, Simone's brother dies,
01:36:24 but you know, they're not actually real blood
01:36:26 siblings, and he can't die, right?
01:36:29 And so I just never thought about it.
01:36:32 Then when you get to episode nine, you're just there,
01:36:34 and he kisses Yoko, and they're going into a fight,
01:36:37 and you're just thinking like, does he actually die?
01:36:40 I know, I was thinking that too.
01:36:41 I pause it at that point.
01:36:42 I was like, thinking, like, recalling all the times
01:36:45 you had mentioned him, and I was just like, no, he doesn't die.
01:36:48 You know, he's been, he said brother.
01:36:50 How did we get two of these in a row?
01:36:51 You asked for this?
01:36:53 You never said Kamina, Mr. Best Man.
01:36:54 What the fuck is the point of this?
01:36:55 So I paused it, and I scrolled through the thumbnails,
01:36:58 and I saw him.
01:36:59 Episode 16, I saw the thumbnail, had Kamina in it.
01:37:02 That's a flashback episode, you dumbass.
01:37:04 Whoa.
01:37:06 All right.
01:37:07 I had shipped him with Yoko.
01:37:08 I was just thinking they're going to have such cute kids,
01:37:11 but it wasn't true.
01:37:13 He did die.
01:37:14 You know, it is a bit of a sin.
01:37:16 I should do that, Mr. Best Man.
01:37:17 I think you should make a rule.
01:37:19 OK, OK, that's enough.
01:37:20 I heard that before he stopped.
01:37:21 This is me off.
01:37:22 Naheads are fucking banned.
01:37:24 If you're in Nahead, I'm going to fucking ban you from the PCG.
01:37:27 That's just someone who's really invested in current law.
01:37:29 Yes, that's all I got from that.
01:37:31 It fucking drives me insane when you go on my anime list,
01:37:33 because they fucking have a list of,
01:37:36 if the show is on Crunchyroll, they'll
01:37:37 have thumbnails of the episodes.
01:37:41 And the first one that appears will always
01:37:43 be whatever is the last or latest episode.
01:37:45 So if you see a thumbnail with the characters,
01:37:49 fucking Crunchyroll just auto-selects a face
01:37:51 from early in the episode.
01:37:53 So if you see a face on episode 12 when you go to Mal,
01:37:56 you immediately know that character is not dead.
01:37:59 I mean, obviously, it could fuck with you,
01:38:00 like this case and this voicemail.
01:38:02 But I'm always, I'm just like, what the fuck?
01:38:04 You literally have spoilers right on the page
01:38:07 where you tell me about the show at all.
01:38:10 I mean, it's kind of weird.
01:38:12 It's like you want to balance not spoiling people,
01:38:14 but I guess they just want to get a little snapshot
01:38:16 of the content of the episode as a preview.
01:38:19 But yeah, it's just like, this character is definitely
01:38:22 not dying by this episode.
01:38:23 So rest assured.
01:38:26 What's that one show that you talked about
01:38:28 where there's a character who you think isn't,
01:38:30 the twist is going to be they're not dead, but you see them.
01:38:33 But it was like a hallucination or something.
01:38:36 It was like a hologram.
01:38:37 I don't know, you did your, I want to fucking video on it.
01:38:39 You know what, who cares?
01:38:40 Doesn't matter.
01:38:41 Are we talking about Steins Gate Zero?
01:38:44 No, it was like, what's the one with the kids
01:38:47 and like the post-apocalypse, and they're all
01:38:49 sci-fi or something.
01:38:52 I don't fucking remember.
01:38:54 Okay, whatever.
01:38:55 Sci-fi.
01:38:56 I mean, don't they have like psychic powers or something?
01:39:01 You know what, who literally cares?
01:39:03 Shinsekai Yuri?
01:39:04 I think that's what I'm trying to think of.
01:39:06 Wasn't there like a guy who died?
01:39:07 Oh, yeah.
01:39:09 No, it's that he dies.
01:39:12 And then like through the whole show,
01:39:13 this girl like thinks that he is still out there.
01:39:16 And then in like one of the last episodes at the very end,
01:39:20 like she emerges from this dark cave and the guy is there
01:39:23 and he's all grown up like he would be
01:39:27 cause he had died when he was younger.
01:39:28 And then it just straight up at the start of the next episode
01:39:31 turns out she was just seeing shit.
01:39:33 Oh my God.
01:39:35 It was just a different character
01:39:36 and she was just seeing shit.
01:39:38 And it was totally meaningless.
01:39:40 That's fucked up.
01:39:41 So fucking annoying.
01:39:43 And people defend that show.
01:39:44 People call that show a 10 out of 10.
01:39:46 Maybe other parts are good.
01:39:47 I don't fucking know.
01:39:48 Not being impressed.
01:39:49 Fucking terrible.
01:39:51 Okay. All right.
01:39:52 Next call.
01:39:53 This one is hashtag bring back to Voo.
01:39:56 Let's see what he has to say.
01:39:57 This is what I was saying.
01:39:58 This is what I was saying before we started.
01:40:00 Gotta bring back to Voo.
01:40:00 People crazy.
01:40:01 The official scarcity of the Voo.
01:40:03 I remember every episode will have like one mention of them,
01:40:10 but only for like a second.
01:40:12 And then no one talks about him ever again.
01:40:15 I just listened to some of the older episodes
01:40:17 of the podcast with the Voo on it.
01:40:20 And I listened to it with my mom and they were fantastic.
01:40:23 I have not enjoyed a podcast for 10 years.
01:40:26 It was a period of sex one with your mom.
01:40:28 I finally did because of the power of the Voo.
01:40:31 And we barely get any Voo content.
01:40:34 He's kind of like a limited edition thing.
01:40:37 Why is this?
01:40:38 Why do all podcast members have to be
01:40:40 Wait, hang on.
01:40:42 Flaky, floppy, gloopy, basically hardened air
01:40:47 like all PCP members are.
01:40:49 And we enjoy the Voo.
01:40:52 Why is the only Voo content we get a video game?
01:40:56 I can't do anything with it.
01:40:57 What's wrong with that?
01:40:57 I can do it.
01:40:58 It's just late.
01:40:59 You can't do what are you supposed to do with a video game?
01:41:03 I'm usually in favor of capitalism.
01:41:05 But if it takes a couple of government interventions,
01:41:11 national policies, higher tax rates,
01:41:15 utilitarianism, whatever it takes for Voo to come back
01:41:20 on the show, let's do it.
01:41:22 Big problem.
01:41:23 The problem here is that you're barking up the wrong tree.
01:41:25 Like you're asking us why isn't Voo on the show?
01:41:28 None of us knows.
01:41:29 He can come back anytime, any day.
01:41:31 Yeah, literally Voo just doesn't.
01:41:34 I mean, he seems to be very adamant about not wanting
01:41:36 to have a public persona.
01:41:38 So there's that.
01:41:38 He just fucked off somewhere.
01:41:40 Because he wanted to.
01:41:41 I suppose, because I didn't think about this point till now,
01:41:45 but I suppose this whole not wanting to have a public persona
01:41:47 might just mean he does not want to be on podcasts.
01:41:50 I mean, especially ours anymore.
01:41:51 I don't know.
01:41:52 I mean, it would seem so.
01:41:53 Yeah, I don't know.
01:41:55 I do know that he's, go on, get it, go on.
01:42:00 I do know that he has explained a little bit
01:42:03 about what's going on on his Patreon, if you patronize.
01:42:06 Oh, really?
01:42:06 Oh, okay.
01:42:07 Well, mostly just that he's working on stuff
01:42:08 and that the Patreon is active again.
01:42:10 That's pretty much it.
01:42:11 It's not that we like pick every episode
01:42:14 of who's going to be on.
01:42:15 It's whoever wants to be on.
01:42:16 It's just whoever shows up.
01:42:19 Like, listen, we want Voo here as much as you do.
01:42:22 We all want more to Voo.
01:42:23 It's not up to us.
01:42:25 We can't do it.
01:42:25 We, he's gonna come to us.
01:42:27 If you got, like, I would encourage if you want
01:42:31 to know what's going on with Voo, talk to Voo.
01:42:35 Do not, like, Voo really does not like
01:42:37 when other people speak for him.
01:42:39 So, like, I would, I don't want to even speculate
01:42:42 about what's, because I don't really know.
01:42:44 I don't know what the hell is going on with him,
01:42:45 because he barely talks about anything
01:42:47 other than editing my videos.
01:42:48 He's not even in the chat.
01:42:50 He left the PCP chat.
01:42:52 He's not even on.
01:42:53 He did that ages ago.
01:42:54 Let's not be hyperbolic.
01:42:55 He's done that before.
01:42:55 He could come back anytime.
01:42:57 No, yeah, he can come back anytime.
01:42:58 Just saying, if you guys want to know
01:43:00 what's going on with Voo, ask to Voo.
01:43:02 Don't ask us.
01:43:02 I was just gonna say, I see Voo in the chat,
01:43:04 but I realize that's just Victor.
01:43:06 Yeah, yeah, I changed Victor's name and role to be Voo.
01:43:11 It was, we were talking about this right before this.
01:43:13 Wait, so never mind.
01:43:14 I guess we've got a new Voo.
01:43:15 It's okay, guys.
01:43:16 We've replaced Voo.
01:43:17 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:43:17 It's all good.
01:43:18 It's all good.
01:43:19 We built a better Voo.
01:43:20 If only Victor ever came online on Discord,
01:43:23 even one single fucking time.
01:43:24 I don't think Victor even has Discord, like, on his computer.
01:43:27 Probably, yeah, probably not.
01:43:29 So he's just like this?
01:43:30 Can't read.
01:43:31 To us, and essentially.
01:43:33 Yeah.
01:43:35 He's just as much of a limited-edition
01:43:37 artificial scarcity boy.
01:43:38 Even more so, even more so.
01:43:40 But yeah, fair enough.
01:43:41 Anytime, people, and don't bug him,
01:43:43 don't harass him or anything,
01:43:44 but I don't know, if you want him to come back,
01:43:46 you could inform him in a polite and respectful way.
01:43:49 I mean, he's on Twitter.
01:43:50 You know, there are ways to contact him.
01:43:53 I don't know if he's still doing that thing
01:43:54 that he had before, though,
01:43:56 where his Twitter, because he had adblocked everything
01:43:59 that wasn't the text entry form,
01:44:02 so that he doesn't see any Twitter except for,
01:44:04 I don't know if he's still doing that, though,
01:44:06 but for a while, he had it so that if he opened Twitter,
01:44:09 it was just a type your tweet
01:44:11 and then a submit button and nothing else.
01:44:13 So he can't even see the response to it or anything?
01:44:15 No, nothing.
01:44:16 Oh, that's interesting.
01:44:16 I don't know if he's still doing that, though.
01:44:18 I copied him for a while.
01:44:19 Dude, I, oh God, what was it?
01:44:22 I talked to Oolulilia,
01:44:24 and he told me that he has software,
01:44:28 he's done something to his computer
01:44:30 at the operating system level
01:44:32 that doesn't let him see certain website,
01:44:36 doesn't let him see anything that Google owns,
01:44:41 including YouTube.
01:44:43 So it was like a robot.
01:44:45 He had much of the internet just blocked from his view.
01:44:51 He's still on Facebook, though.
01:44:53 He's doing that.
01:44:54 Even this is his data.
01:44:56 Such lengths to avoid a certain company
01:44:59 for various reasons, I don't know,
01:45:01 but then Facebook's totally okay.
01:45:03 Well, I mean, it's monopolized, dude.
01:45:05 It's either one or the other,
01:45:06 or you're a fucking in no man's land, basically.
01:45:08 Yeah, I guess.
01:45:09 Space exists.
01:45:10 Yeah, fair.
01:45:12 Did you hear that MySpace just lost eight years of posts
01:45:16 or whatever?
01:45:17 Everybody's, what?
01:45:18 It's lost, like somebody spilled some fucking bang
01:45:22 on the hard drive, and it all exploded.
01:45:24 They really banged up that hard drive, and, yeah.
01:45:26 That big bang is just control.
01:45:28 It's control.
01:45:29 No, do we have any more voicemails?
01:45:31 All right, we've got a couple more.
01:45:32 Let's go through.
01:45:33 Okay, next one is, oh, this is a good one.
01:45:35 It's Ben St. Killed My Grandma.
01:45:38 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, but before we play,
01:45:40 I just wanna say for the past three months,
01:45:43 for the entire voicemail section,
01:45:45 I have been on the YouTube homepage,
01:45:48 just like watching shitty fucking terrible
01:45:54 new Western animation like teaser trailers
01:45:57 without the sound on, and trying to match
01:45:59 your guys' voice to shit, ah, Western animation characters.
01:46:05 So right now, right now I am the bunny
01:46:08 from the Secret Life of Pets 2,
01:46:10 being really angry on screen right now.
01:46:12 I highly recommend this experience.
01:46:14 Please give us a screen cap or something.
01:46:15 Secret Life of Pets sounds like the most
01:46:17 human core fucking show I've ever heard of.
01:46:19 But isn't it Animal Core though, because it's pets?
01:46:22 Liking animals is human.
01:46:24 Okay, I guess that's fair.
01:46:25 Okay, let's move on.
01:46:26 Ben St. Killed My Grandma, and I wanna hear about it.
01:46:28 Yeah.
01:46:29 Let's go.
01:46:33 Oop.
01:46:36 Commencing audio playback.
01:46:39 Classified information moving in three, two, one.
01:46:44 Guys, listen to me, I don't have much time.
01:46:46 I'm from the future, the year 2021.
01:46:49 In the year 2020, the PCP falls apart.
01:46:52 When them snakes, the guy who dropped that awesome track,
01:46:56 he buys Ben's kidney stone, reverse-engineers it,
01:46:59 and creates an army of Ben snakes, it's Armageddon.
01:47:04 Ben rises in power, he's playing so much Garfield Go,
01:47:09 that now he declares every day Monday for the populace,
01:47:12 only he gets to experience Fridays.
01:47:14 Every other day's Monday falls.
01:47:16 He controls everything.
01:47:17 The stores only sell keto food.
01:47:20 It's, I can't do this, or you don't think it affects
01:47:22 the PCP, you think I'm being overdramatic?
01:47:24 Listen to this.
01:47:26 As the inheritor, as the new inheritor of title
01:47:30 of PCP dictator, what?
01:47:32 Just like to say, best guy, we wish you well
01:47:35 in your future.
01:47:36 What is this?
01:47:37 And our attorneys will be contacting you soon
01:47:41 and we'll see you in court, you motherfucker.
01:47:44 Ben.
01:47:44 I remember, yeah, that sounds like something
01:47:46 I would say in the future.
01:47:47 In the future, yeah.
01:47:48 You have to drag me out of my gold-plated office
01:47:51 by my dead fucking claws.
01:47:54 When them snakes clones my kidney stone
01:47:56 and turns it into an army of Ben Saints, guess what?
01:47:59 We're all voting for Yang.
01:48:00 We're all gonna be Yang gang.
01:48:02 I guess, fair enough.
01:48:03 So you have complete domination over the world,
01:48:05 but you're still voting.
01:48:06 Yeah, that's right.
01:48:09 Well, Yang gang wants Yang gang for life.
01:48:11 That's really all there is to it, so.
01:48:13 Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's incremental steps.
01:48:16 2020, Ben St, the Ben St collective,
01:48:20 elects Yang.
01:48:21 2021, we are Yang.
01:48:23 We replaced him.
01:48:26 All right, let's move along here.
01:48:28 That's a terrifying thought,
01:48:29 but next up is hipster Cthulhu calling in again.
01:48:32 The future's looking bright, boys.
01:48:34 All right, Cthulhu, lay it on us.
01:48:37 Hey, PCP, you know, it's a bit windy outside.
01:48:39 Let me just open the window.
01:48:41 Oh, okay.
01:48:48 That's it.
01:48:49 That's the entire podcast call.
01:48:51 Yeah, this is pretty good.
01:48:52 I feel refreshed.
01:48:53 I feel, yeah, it was nice.
01:48:55 It was cooling.
01:48:58 Oh, okay, you know what?
01:48:59 So last time I said, we got a call from a podcast
01:49:02 in the middle of someone else's podcast.
01:49:04 That one was shit, but this one's a little bit better.
01:49:06 So let's hear what he has to say.
01:49:08 Hello, and welcome back to the podcast
01:49:09 that takes place in the middle of someone else's podcast.
01:49:11 Today's theme of this podcast is the crushing
01:49:14 existential dread you feel
01:49:17 when the members of the podcast,
01:49:19 you are trying to have your respectable podcast
01:49:21 in the middle of don't deem you worthy,
01:49:24 but still have the gall to mention the fact that you exist.
01:49:30 So it's not just like they just missed over you,
01:49:32 but it's like they noticed you were there,
01:49:34 but you were just not good enough.
01:49:36 And you know, in a way that is crushing and soul destroying,
01:49:39 but another way it pushes you to make better content.
01:49:43 So that's the end of this podcast.
01:49:45 Thanks for listening.
01:49:46 I'll give you an example of that, I'm guessing.
01:49:47 Who sent that one?
01:49:50 His name is simply podcast
01:49:51 in the middle of someone else's podcast.
01:49:53 That's all I know.
01:49:55 He sounded a little bit like no thank you.
01:49:58 Maybe it's him.
01:49:59 It's a mystery to everybody.
01:50:01 Well, maybe we'll see improved content for him coming up.
01:50:04 Okay, moving on.
01:50:05 Something about black people with British accents.
01:50:09 Yeah.
01:50:10 What a, it's so, it's so.
01:50:11 Oh, do you think that was a black guy?
01:50:13 Did it, I thought so.
01:50:15 That'd be my guess if I had to guess.
01:50:18 I didn't.
01:50:19 Who knows?
01:50:21 Ben confirmed racist.
01:50:21 Okay, moving on.
01:50:23 That's right.
01:50:24 We've got LPCP roll call, Scorcho.
01:50:27 That's his full name.
01:50:28 Okay, go.

01:51:06 I feel very denigrated.
01:51:09 I just mentioned my name.
01:51:11 I didn't even get a blurb.
01:51:12 Yeah, that's true.
01:51:13 I mean, Digi didn't even get mentioned, right?
01:51:15 Oh, did I?
01:51:16 No.

01:51:18 Wasn't he at the very beginning
01:51:19 right before he started saying, or did I miss it?
01:51:21 Oh, okay.
01:51:22 No, it was DeVu and Tom.
01:51:23 Yeah, DeVu and Tom, lol.
01:51:25 Oh, wait, did he miss anybody else?

01:52:06 I think that interrupting-
01:52:07 Okay, hold on a second.
01:52:09 I wanna say something.
01:52:10 I think that interrupting is always bad.
01:52:12 I wouldn't ever do it.
01:52:13 I'm really enjoying, it's really hard to listen to.
01:52:16 It's so weird.
01:52:19 I'm just like a bunch of baby chicks.

01:52:41 Indeed case point proven interrupting is the best
01:52:50 Wait that wasn't megalovania that was um that was like

01:56:26 So it's Nate Nate is green and it has sunglasses
01:56:31 Okay, just because the riddle was pretty much the same as mine
01:56:34 Yeah, just because the answer was relatively easy to decipher. It doesn't mean it was not a riddle
01:56:38 It was just you know riddle for babies. My mind was just like who does
01:56:43 Credit where credit is due in rhyming. This is a hilarious fucking premise
01:56:47 It's not that he was able to decipher what each line meant. He figured out that BGE started the sentences

01:57:34 Same you know a lot of the times you guys would say stuff like this isn't an anime podcast
01:57:41 And this isn't a podcast where we talk about anime you losers stop asking about it, but considering I also didn't assume it was a
01:57:50 podcast about politics and you seem to talk a shit ton about that I
01:57:55 Think it's only fair that we finally get the answer to the age-old question

02:00:43 But the other one supposedly will be out

02:00:51 Think that's it is a demo. Yeah, that's that's right. You know a voicemail by the way go on much. Go ahead
02:00:57 Well, I just want to say that I don't believe you
02:01:01 That's the thing. We'll have to see
02:01:03 I've doubted this project from the beginning April 1st, right April 1st
02:01:07 Hmm that day has no larger significance than I'm aware of so that should be fine
02:01:12 They seem they seem I mean despite the day
02:01:15 They have been on record at saying that the best kind of surprises on April fools are actual things that you think are bullshit
02:01:23 But turn out to actually be real and cool and dope
02:01:26 So maybe you know, I will reserve judgment. I will reserve judgment. How exciting first how exciting anyway
02:01:33 Follow those guys. Well, go go check out if it's out by the time you're hearing this, I guess
02:01:37 Interesting that's that's at PCP dating sim and at PCP dating are the two competing, you know
02:01:43 We got a voicemail from somebody it was something essentially like he made like a in one minute
02:01:48 He made a PCP dating sim that was like a Google text thing you could type into it wasn't I think was a joke though
02:01:54 So I didn't you know what it sounds while we're doing our promos
02:01:57 I just felt the need to say if you're listening to this podcast
02:02:01 And you need more content in your life
02:02:06 Subscribe to everybody on the podcast and watch all their videos. I
02:02:12 Don't know it's it's it's weird because I know there's people who listen to PCP who only like actually follow a couple of us
02:02:19 Or maybe just one or somebody. Yeah, yeah
02:02:22 The conceit of this podcast is a bunch of people who make good videos
02:02:28 So go watch them all make good stuff. Yeah, I well, you know
02:02:36 We'll say good content
02:02:39 Everybody in the group makes good content, so go follow the rest of their content
02:02:48 Because I just I just hear every once in a while people who are like
02:02:51 Oh, I don't know anything about X member of the PCP and I'm like why why do you not know anything about any
02:02:57 Member if you're a fan of one of us, why would you you would like all of our content?

02:03:42 Do you mean the hippo talks for minutes video? Yeah, hippo crit talks for minutes. Yeah, sometimes
02:03:49 Focus on basically marketing yourself can go a long way a very long way
02:03:56 My reputation for patreon.com
02:03:58 Slash been saying I had never say it anymore and it's been to my detriment indeed indeed
02:04:02 It was this essential me a foundational meme really. So I'm no so any any
02:04:08 Ben say also read my any marketing campaign eventually starts to ring hollow to people when they hear it too much
02:04:13 It was got to be re-entering. Yeah platform. I couldn't strike the right balance
02:04:17 I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't just keep ramming that down people's throats forever. I had to find a new tactic
02:04:22 So instead I just stopped
