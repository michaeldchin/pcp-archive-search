00:00:00 I'm going to bless that guy. That son of a bi-
00:00:03 That son of a-
00:00:05 That son of a-
00:00:07 That son of a-
00:00:09 That son of a bi-
00:00:11 I gotta say, my new microphone does make me feel a little bit cool.
00:00:19 It wasn't really even that expensive.
00:00:21 Should have upgraded a long time ago.
00:00:23 But better late than never.
00:00:26 Microboy.
00:00:29 That's what my sexual partners call me.
00:00:35 Anyway, welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast.
00:00:39 That's as good a place to start as any LA's are keep it all in.
00:00:44 Welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast.
00:00:47 The program podcast.
00:00:49 It's Ben St. who's giving to you.
00:00:51 Hey, here's my bit for the day.
00:00:53 Okay, ready?
00:00:54 Yeah.
00:00:55 Are you ready for my bit?
00:00:57 Yeah.
00:00:58 Row, row, row v-way, gently down the drain.
00:01:02 Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.
00:01:05 Life is pain.
00:01:07 Okay, yeah.
00:01:09 Pretty good.
00:01:10 That's pretty good.
00:01:11 I think I've improved the mood.
00:01:13 I did it.
00:01:14 I...
00:01:15 Damn it.
00:01:17 I had forgotten about...
00:01:19 I had woken up this morning and I hadn't thought about that.
00:01:23 Yeah.
00:01:24 And I had forgotten about it until you just reminded me.
00:01:27 It is one of those things where it's like everyone was so upset, understandably,
00:01:32 and there was the only thing I could see on Twitter.
00:01:34 I was everybody talking about it.
00:01:36 I think everybody wanted to not have that be the timeline anymore,
00:01:40 so they decided, okay, I'm just going to talk about other things now
00:01:44 and then Twitter is completely different the day after.
00:01:47 And I was like, wait, I don't want to forget about this.
00:01:50 I would like to not worry about it,
00:01:53 but I don't want this to fall into the background.
00:01:56 It did not fall into the background for me at all.
00:02:02 You know, I had a realization about who I follow on Twitter.
00:02:09 I'm pretty sure that like a lot of the people that I follow
00:02:14 are people who have podcasts that I don't listen to,
00:02:19 but they were like friends with the chapeau guys.
00:02:24 I feel like a large percentage of people that I follow
00:02:27 are people who are on Twitter who have podcasts,
00:02:30 like who were on chapeau, who are friends with chapeau,
00:02:33 and that's how I know them, even though I don't listen to their podcasts.
00:02:37 Because I don't know where a lot of these people come from.
00:02:39 I just like their takes.
00:02:44 So anyway, all that is to say,
00:02:47 no, I never stopped seeing it on Twitter.
00:02:50 In fact, you know what I did?
00:02:52 I did something unprecedented yesterday.
00:02:55 I downloaded an app and I blocked Twitter for myself.
00:02:58 Oh, good.
00:03:00 Yeah.
00:03:01 That is a good thing to do.
00:03:03 Yeah.
00:03:04 Not specifically because of Roe v. Wade, although that doesn't help.
00:03:12 I just don't think I use it in a healthy way.
00:03:15 I don't use it in a productive way.
00:03:17 Even though I feel like I see other people use it the way that I use it
00:03:21 and nothing bad happens to them.
00:03:23 Well, I mean, you don't know that.
00:03:25 I guess I don't know that.
00:03:27 I guess that's true.
00:03:33 I was looking into the Supreme Court
00:03:37 and I didn't learn too much.
00:03:39 I didn't do a big research.
00:03:43 I see all these pictures of guillotines
00:03:45 and I'm like, cool, nice.
00:03:47 We're all on the same page that this isn't good.
00:03:53 Change the Supreme Court would be the thing.
00:03:57 And I'm like, okay, well, how would we do that?
00:04:00 And they are on there for life, apparently.
00:04:04 They retire, but there's no thing to force them to retire.
00:04:09 They can retire, yeah.
00:04:11 So they would have to decide to do it and...
00:04:14 Well, the other thing would be to pack the court,
00:04:17 which is to expand the court and make new positions
00:04:21 and then appoint new people.
00:04:23 Right, I heard about that.
00:04:25 Joe Biden didn't even give a shit to try that.
00:04:29 He was just sitting there.
00:04:32 I don't know what he does.
00:04:34 No, they don't want to rock the boat.
00:04:38 Well, we don't want to upset the fascist.
00:04:41 We don't want to upset anyone.
00:04:48 So it's like, I don't know.
00:04:50 Why don't we just lock them in a hole in the ground?
00:04:57 Called a grave.
00:04:59 Maybe you've heard...
00:05:01 I don't remember who I saw say this,
00:05:03 but this is a sentiment I've seen expressed by a lot of people,
00:05:07 but the most succinct way, the most punchiest way I've seen it,
00:05:11 was people hear that the Supreme Court Justice appointment is for life,
00:05:19 and most people hear that and think that it's a long appointment,
00:05:24 but I hear that and I think, hmm, but it could be a short appointment.
00:05:29 I thought that's pretty good.
00:05:32 Yeah.
00:05:34 What was the old lady who died recently?
00:05:39 Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
00:05:40 Yeah, how old was she?
00:05:42 I remember hearing things like she was like...
00:05:44 I don't remember exactly...
00:05:45 Almost 90, I think.
00:05:46 And she had cancer.
00:05:47 People were saying she was so old she had to retire,
00:05:49 but she stayed on for some reason or another.
00:05:51 Yeah, she had cancer a few times.
00:05:56 She was very old and she had a history of cancer.
00:06:03 I don't know exactly what killed her, but...
00:06:08 Was it COVID?
00:06:09 Because I know she went and she was at that wedding.
00:06:13 One of the last things she ever did was she officiated some people's wedding,
00:06:19 and then she died.
00:06:22 Just like Andrew Hussie.
00:06:25 Did that happen?
00:06:26 He died?
00:06:27 No, not that part.
00:06:29 Yeah, he didn't attend a wedding, but he did die.
00:06:35 I need to know more about the Supreme Court.
00:06:38 I haven't really wanted to...
00:06:41 The vague things I've seen are like,
00:06:43 wow, this sucks.
00:06:45 Either you stack the court in order to make it more...
00:06:52 so that you can push your agenda, whoever's in power.
00:06:57 And it's like, well, surely that means the other side could do it again,
00:07:01 which is obviously what Trump was able to do by stacking the court.
00:07:05 That's not what he did.
00:07:08 Like, primarily Republican Christian idiot people.
00:07:12 He didn't expand the court.
00:07:14 No.
00:07:15 It simply worked out that he had to make three appointments.
00:07:19 Well, okay, there's actually a little more to it,
00:07:21 because it's not like Trump had to make those appointments fairly,
00:07:24 because Obama had appointments that he could have made,
00:07:28 and the Republicans in the Senate,
00:07:32 they didn't refuse his picks.
00:07:36 They simply refused to convene to decide whether to appoint his appointments.
00:07:42 See, like, this is stupid.
00:07:45 So it's not like it was fair, yeah.
00:07:48 Obama should have made one of those appointments.
00:07:51 From the ground up, the idea that this, hypothetically,
00:07:56 the Supreme Court is a bunch of people who are very, very smart,
00:08:01 and they make the unbiased opinions when partisan people in the Congress
00:08:08 make a bad idea, and the Supreme Court, who are so above all that,
00:08:13 who are not partisan at all, will sort it out and make it good.
00:08:19 But they don't, because they're humans, and that's a stupid idea,
00:08:23 and I don't know why the system even exists to this day.
00:08:26 It seems very archaic, and obviously will be a real problem for democracy forever.
00:08:35 It's some sort of fantasy to believe that these people,
00:08:43 oh, they will simply look to constitutional precedent.
00:08:51 They'll simply look at the Constitution itself,
00:08:55 and in interpreting what one document or precedent document has said before,
00:09:02 they will thereby arrive at the most, I don't know, the most constitutional thing to be done.
00:09:11 The Constitution...
00:09:13 It's stupid, it's outdated, it's just paper making new country.
00:09:19 Sure, but even if we accepted that the Constitution is good,
00:09:26 it's not like there's any objective truth to be arrived at about what it meant.
00:09:34 Maybe sometimes there is, but it's not like you can actually go
00:09:39 and just read into it exactly what was meant in every situation,
00:09:43 and dig all you need are the seven of the most unbiased people in the world,
00:09:49 and you will get the most constitutional government.
00:09:52 It doesn't make any sense.
00:09:54 It's vague, and it doesn't know the future, so certain future things have to be interpreted
00:10:01 based on text from the past, so it's impossible to know the rules going forward for everything,
00:10:09 and it's just a bad idea, which is why it's still there,
00:10:15 because it can be easily manipulated to do whatever you want,
00:10:19 and that's great, they love that.
00:10:22 Fuck in, did you read Clarence Thomas saying,
00:10:30 yeah, well, we got this, we got rid of abortion.
00:10:35 We should literally look at interracial marriage,
00:10:43 we should look at interracial marriage next, and gay marriage, and contraception.
00:10:46 We should reconsider whether those should be protected.
00:10:52 There's no secret about it, they're just saying,
00:10:58 alright, so civil rights, we never liked those,
00:11:02 and now that it's been proven that we can just get rid of them,
00:11:05 we should think about getting rid of all of them,
00:11:08 and there's nothing that anybody can do about it except, I don't know, nothing.
00:11:14 There was that one senator saying, we should look at Brown v. Board of Education,
00:11:19 we should consider segregating our schools again.
00:11:23 They're just doing it, man, they're just going for it.
00:11:28 And the Democrats are all saying, vote, vote, on what, how?
00:11:35 What are we supposed to vote for? You're already the president.
00:11:38 They said this was on the ballot, and then, well, we elected Joe Biden,
00:11:44 and I think we expanded, I think we expanded, we got more seats in,
00:11:51 we got more seats in Congress, Democrats got more seats in Congress,
00:11:54 and they didn't, you know, they did not codify Roe,
00:11:59 so, well, you didn't do it, and now they got rid of it.
00:12:03 So how is it on the ballot? How is this on the ballot anymore?
00:12:08 Yeah, I don't even know, like, from their perspective,
00:12:11 like, all I can assume is that they like abortion being gone,
00:12:15 some of them, maybe Joe, I know Joe has been like anti-abortion in the past,
00:12:20 but like, you know, like, what do they feel like a game plan is going forward with this knowledge?
00:12:29 Like, all I see is them saying, remember to vote for us because we wouldn't do that,
00:12:35 even though you let it happen, and you're not doing anything against it,
00:12:40 so it's almost like, I don't know, there's an evil villain,
00:12:44 and there's like, I'm evil, I'm doing evil things, and then a little, like, frog is there,
00:12:51 and he's saying, I'll stop him, but it's a frog, and the evil villain has like giant boots and a gun,
00:12:58 and like, he can squash the frog, and the frog's not going to do anything anyway,
00:13:02 he's going to rib it in the pond, and that's it.
00:13:04 Like, why would I vote for this? Why would I give money to this?
00:13:08 You're not going to do anything.
00:13:10 It's true, it is true, so that, I don't know, vanilla opinions on Twitter said,
00:13:19 and they're right, like, on the one hand, it is true that like, had a, what was it,
00:13:28 like, if we had more Democrats in Congress, or if Bernie Sanders had won the nomination in 2016,
00:13:35 or if Hillary Clinton had beaten Trump in the general election, then it's true
00:13:40 that Roe v. Wade would still be on the books.
00:13:43 Like, any of those things would have done it.
00:13:45 Sure.
00:13:46 So, it's not like voting doesn't do anything, but on the other hand,
00:13:50 What is voting going to do right now?
00:13:52 What is voting going to do right now?
00:13:54 I think more than anything, like, very, very, like, notable protests are the bare minimum,
00:14:01 because if people in power, if the Supreme Court don't feel like this decision has impacted
00:14:09 America in a negative way, or at least their own, like, situation in a negative way,
00:14:16 if they don't feel scared about it, nothing will go right.
00:14:21 They need to know, somebody needs to know, somebody needs to know that this is not good,
00:14:27 and the American people don't like it.
00:14:29 Yeah.
00:14:30 So, protest is like the bare minimum.
00:14:32 Well, I'm sure they do know that.
00:14:34 I'm sure they do, but like, you know, you can't rely on the morals of the people in power,
00:14:41 but you can rely on their fear of, like, people running into their house
00:14:45 and burning it down and killing them.
00:14:47 Yeah.
00:14:48 That doesn't seem to be happening, though.
00:14:50 No.
00:14:51 That's what I've been waiting for, is knowledge and stuff like that coming on the news.
00:14:58 Hasn't happened.
00:15:00 Sad.
00:15:01 Yeah.
00:15:02 Well, what are you going to do about it?
00:15:06 I don't know.
00:15:07 I'm just going to...
00:15:09 These extreme...
00:15:10 I've seen some people calling it, like, backwards, like, oh, these justices are so backwards,
00:15:14 like, oh, this is such a backwards decision.
00:15:16 It's not...
00:15:17 I don't agree with that description.
00:15:19 It's extremist is what it is.
00:15:22 Yeah.
00:15:23 So, these extremist judges are just going to keep...
00:15:25 You know, they've got a 6-3 majority, so they're going to do more stuff just like this.
00:15:30 And then they're going to...
00:15:32 And then Congress is going to vote to give them more police protection,
00:15:38 as they continue to take rights away,
00:15:42 and then people are angry and they want to do something about it in Minecraft.
00:15:48 And then Congress is going to give them more protection to prevent that,
00:15:52 and the cycle will just continue.
00:15:54 And I don't know what's there to be done about it.
00:15:57 Yeah.
00:16:00 Our lawyers have said we cannot continue the podcasts from this point.
00:16:04 We must move topic.
00:16:06 Yeah, that's right.
00:16:08 It's true.
00:16:09 There's nothing else to it that you can infer the rest.
00:16:12 Moving on.
00:16:14 God, it's so fucked.
00:16:16 It's really fucked.
00:16:17 It's really fucked.
00:16:18 It's hard to even talk about.
00:16:22 I'm glad I'm over here that he's in there.
00:16:25 Yeah.
00:16:26 Over here in the UK where...
00:16:28 Everything's good.
00:16:29 Everything's good and there's no, like, idiot in charge.
00:16:33 I mean, the only thing I'm hearing about Boris Johnson lately is that
00:16:37 he had that party during COVID that has been, like, the monster beach.
00:16:42 He had a party during lockdown.
00:16:44 Like a Super Spreader event?
00:16:45 Like, no, no.
00:16:46 It was like during COVID lockdown, like you said, everyone stay inside.
00:16:50 Oh, like a big masked ball inside of a castle while the commoners were outside?
00:16:55 Yeah, essentially.
00:16:56 He had, like, a party with alcohol and no masks and no vaccine didn't exist at the time.
00:17:02 And he was just like, haha, people have to do what I say, but I don't.
00:17:06 I don't have to follow the rules.
00:17:08 And he was like, that has come to light and it's, like, been proven.
00:17:12 And it's like, aha, we got you.
00:17:14 That's all.
00:17:15 Is that what they were doing?
00:17:16 The vote of no confidence in Boris over?
00:17:19 I thought it was a big, like, referendum on Boris.
00:17:23 There's been a vote of, I don't know if there's a vote of no confidence specifically,
00:17:27 but like a bunch of people in the conservative party have left in embarrassment
00:17:33 or to save their own careers to not be associated with Boris.
00:17:37 Boris is just sitting there and saying, I'm not going to apologize.
00:17:40 I'm just going to stay here.
00:17:42 And that's that.
00:17:43 Cool.
00:17:44 And there's been by-elections in the areas where members of parliament have left.
00:17:50 The conservatives have left being in charge.
00:17:53 And so there was a little election and there was a Labour win and a Lib Dem win.
00:17:59 And so there are less conservative MPs than there were before.
00:18:03 And Boris is just sitting there saying, I don't, I'm not going to change.
00:18:06 I'm just, this is how I am and I'm going to the future.
00:18:12 Ukraine, we've got to give money to Ukraine.
00:18:14 Good for him sticking to his guns.
00:18:15 Good for him sticking to his guns.
00:18:17 Yeah, I mean, you know, I love him.
00:18:19 You know what?
00:18:20 I'll kiss him on the mouth, but I hate him.
00:18:22 When the woke mob comes to cancel you for no reason like that,
00:18:26 you just got to stand your ground.
00:18:28 Don't apologize to these people because it's never enough.
00:18:31 So that's never, never, never enough.
00:18:34 That's all I'm hearing about at the moment with regards to the leading of the UK.
00:18:39 It's just, if Spar is going to resign, no, Bob, but, but, but please resign.
00:18:45 No, I won't.
00:18:46 Come on.
00:18:47 Come on.
00:18:48 Come on.
00:18:49 No, be reasonable, please.
00:18:51 It's just, it's just so like whatever.
00:18:54 Nobody, he doesn't care.
00:18:56 And he doesn't need to leave.
00:18:58 You could do so much better.
00:19:00 So he's not going to.
00:19:01 I think we should get together now.
00:19:03 And that's what everyone's talking about.
00:19:06 Yeah.
00:19:07 Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like the prime minister.
00:19:10 Okay.
00:19:11 Sorry.
00:19:12 No more.
00:19:13 No more.
00:19:14 Yeah.
00:19:15 So like Boris is like shit and he's Trump adjacent and he's a, he's a money grubbing,
00:19:20 power hungry idiot who doesn't know anything.
00:19:23 Huh?
00:19:24 Is this his second term?
00:19:27 He, we don't have terms in the same way.
00:19:31 Right.
00:19:32 So they're not like, it's not a set amount of years.
00:19:34 But I guess, yeah, it's his first like being in office.
00:19:37 I think he did.
00:19:40 There was a, some sort of a referendum at some point.
00:19:45 And he got more members of parliament, like conservative, one more.
00:19:50 Cause Theresa May was embarrassing.
00:19:53 But because of the, this, the, the smear campaign against Jeremy Corbyn,
00:19:57 Boris Johnson gained more power.
00:20:00 And it was dreadful.
00:20:03 It was awful.
00:20:06 So like the UK sucks politically, but at least, at least we're not getting rid of.
00:20:13 At least abortion is legal there, right?
00:20:15 Yeah.
00:20:16 Yeah.
00:20:17 We're not getting rid of like.
00:20:18 That's dire.
00:20:19 It's so fucking dire.
00:20:20 Civil liberties have been enshrined and like everyone in, in most of the world agrees
00:20:24 are a good thing unless they're like a fundamentalist, extremist, religious, zealot idiot.
00:20:29 Yeah.
00:20:31 Well.
00:20:32 Yeah.
00:20:33 What did, what did, um, I just keep, I just keep thinking about Contra points tweet about
00:20:38 that, that woman that screamed when, when Trump got elected.
00:20:44 She was right.
00:20:45 She was exactly right.
00:20:46 She was 100% right.
00:20:48 And we all look stupid for making fun of her.
00:20:50 She had a completely proportionate reaction to what would, to what would come of that.
00:20:58 She knew much better than we did.
00:21:00 It's incredible.
00:21:01 Yeah.
00:21:02 Yeah.
00:21:03 Um, anyway.
00:21:04 Well, I'm going to go move to Saudi Arabia.
00:21:09 See, uh, they got better, they got a better healthcare over there.
00:21:14 A civilized country.
00:21:15 I just have to pretend I'm not trans.
00:21:17 Uh, Saudi Arabia.
00:21:19 I'll be safe.
00:21:20 Wait, that's the really bad one, right?
00:21:22 That's the extremely bad one.
00:21:23 Yes.
00:21:24 That's the really, that's the one that Trump's like friends with.
00:21:27 It's weird.
00:21:28 This is going to sound stupid.
00:21:30 It's, it's weird to me that Trump seems like he's like, like he's like taking credit for
00:21:35 this win.
00:21:36 And I remember, you know, he, like during the campaign drill, he was saying like, uh,
00:21:40 will, will, he said he would do exactly this.
00:21:42 I'll put judges, conservative judges on the bench and they'll rescind Roe v. Wade.
00:21:46 And that's what he did.
00:21:47 And it's kind of weird to me that like he cares about that because he doesn't seem, he's
00:21:52 not a religious guy.
00:21:54 He doesn't seem like a guy who would really give it.
00:21:58 I don't know.
00:21:59 Just like that's what his base wants.
00:22:00 So that's what he's going to promise.
00:22:02 I would imagine it's what his base wants.
00:22:05 Yeah.
00:22:06 More so than like, cause he's a power.
00:22:08 Cause he's a pro vaccine.
00:22:10 He's like, like he's like in favor of the vaccines.
00:22:12 And he's like, he views the vaccines as like being like a big thing that he got done under
00:22:17 his presidency and he's proud of it.
00:22:19 And like a lot of his base really, that makes them really mad.
00:22:23 Yeah.
00:22:24 Trump is not extreme enough for them.
00:22:26 Yeah.
00:22:27 As it turns out.
00:22:28 He's the QAnon king.
00:22:30 Yeah.
00:22:31 He's more of a human being than they want.
00:22:33 And they are looking for more like free.
00:22:36 What's the, what's her face?
00:22:38 Marjorie Taylor Greene.
00:22:39 Yeah.
00:22:40 Like she, she's the, the sort of person QAnon and, and that type of, of, of conservative
00:22:46 once in a Republican once in a, in the old power.
00:22:52 Yeah.
00:22:53 Yeah.
00:22:54 Well.
00:22:56 Uh, that's, yeah.
00:22:58 He, he's got, yeah.
00:23:00 Trump has his, has his regrettable human foibles, like, uh, thinking vaccines work and so forth.
00:23:06 Uh, you know, forgive, forgivable eccentricities.
00:23:09 I mean, he did deny them for a time.
00:23:12 Cause, you know.
00:23:14 Well, yeah.
00:23:15 And then, and then I don't know when, I do remember he said, but you really should get
00:23:20 the vaccines and then his whole crowd booed him.
00:23:23 Well, he didn't, he didn't say, he didn't say like vaccines bad.
00:23:27 He bunk, he did bungle the COVID response, but he didn't say like,
00:23:31 I can't remember exactly what he did.
00:23:32 Don't get back.
00:23:33 I'm sure it was a Trumpism.
00:23:34 I'm sure it was really stupid.
00:23:36 He just, he basically just said like, uh, you know what, don't worry about the virus.
00:23:41 Uh, we're going to try to like, we're just going to ignore it and hopefully, and not
00:23:46 let it hurt the economy.
00:23:48 And, uh, and that's, and that's our strategy.
00:23:50 Yeah, that's probably it.
00:23:51 Get back to work.
00:23:52 I'm going to wear masks.
00:23:53 He, they, they, they, they like didn't do anything about it.
00:23:56 Like when, when it was becoming clear that it was going to be like a serious deal, he
00:24:00 like really downplayed it and was like, we're going to, uh, what do they call it?
00:24:06 There was this particular, was it like the no fear strategy or like the no panic strategy
00:24:12 or something like that, which is basically just pretend it's not a problem, uh, for
00:24:17 as long as possible.
00:24:18 And it was great.
00:24:20 You know, uh, she, man, she, it's, it's pretty, it's, I don't know.
00:24:34 It's all, it's all pretty disheartening this week.
00:24:38 Yeah.
00:24:39 It was a rough week.
00:24:40 It's, it's been a rough week.
00:24:41 And it was, for me, I was dealing with a bit of depression.
00:24:46 Oh, you too.
00:24:47 Before the news.
00:24:48 Me too.
00:24:50 Great.
00:24:51 It's not just me.
00:24:52 All right.
00:24:53 Cool.
00:24:54 No.
00:24:55 Yeah.
00:24:56 I, I got a therapist or like a, on better help.
00:25:01 I don't know if that's good.
00:25:02 I was just sort of like, I don't fucking give a shit to like research anything.
00:25:06 I'm just going to type in a therapist on Google and get something because I just, I just
00:25:10 need something.
00:25:11 Um, and I got this lady and I'm talking to her a few sessions now and I was talking
00:25:17 about her, I was talking about being depressed and she said to fight depression.
00:25:22 I don't know how smart this is or not.
00:25:25 Uh, but to fight depression, you need to get out of your own head.
00:25:28 Sitting there stewing in your own brain is the worst thing you can do.
00:25:33 It can lead to suicide.
00:25:34 When you're depressed, you need to distract yourself.
00:25:37 You need to get into someone else's head.
00:25:40 So like talk to someone.
00:25:42 Failing that, uh, distracting yourself with video games and TV is, is adequate.
00:25:48 And I'm like, Oh, well, you know, when I'm depressed, I feel more depressed and guilty
00:25:55 when I go binge like a show or just play a games over and over again and feel like,
00:26:01 Oh God, this sucks.
00:26:03 But I do realize that in the moment when I'm watching something really good, like, uh,
00:26:08 I've been rewatching Breaking Bad.
00:26:10 Yeah.
00:26:11 I do not feel depressed during those times.
00:26:15 And so if that's, that's, if that's adequate to like distract myself, I've always felt
00:26:20 like distracting yourself from your problems is a negative thing and you shouldn't do that.
00:26:24 Damn.
00:26:25 If that's adequate, then call me the king of adequacy.
00:26:28 Yeah.
00:26:29 Cause it's just, I don't know.
00:26:33 You get these, these impressions of how you're supposed to do things based on life
00:26:38 experience.
00:26:39 And then a therapist tells you, no, it's okay if you want to binge watch stuff.
00:26:43 Yeah.
00:26:44 Just try not to like focus on your negative thoughts because you're going to go in a
00:26:47 spiral.
00:26:48 And I do.
00:26:49 So, uh, everybody distract yourself.
00:26:54 Uh, do, do anything.
00:26:56 Do anything but think about the current state of the world.
00:26:59 Yeah.
00:27:00 Uh, I've been, um, I've been playing, I've been playing Mega Man.
00:27:06 Sometimes I do it on stream.
00:27:08 I've been, I've streamed again on my Twitch for like the first time in forever.
00:27:12 Uh, yeah, which is kind of neat.
00:27:16 Uh, feels, feels, makes me feel a little bit bad because well, yeah, distract, you know,
00:27:26 playing video games doesn't accomplish anything and it makes me feel a little bit bad.
00:27:31 I feel a little guilty that I'm like, what am I, what am I accomplishing here?
00:27:35 Um, I feel when I, when I stream on Twitch, it's like, it's good, but also I feel bad
00:27:41 because I let, I let that language for two years.
00:27:44 I've been in the stream for two years and I feel like I lost all the momentum that I
00:27:47 had with streaming that I once had.
00:27:49 And that really bums me out.
00:27:52 Um, I mean, I guess that's, that's it.
00:27:58 The, the, the guilt of, of things, I mean, I, this is not something the therapist told
00:28:03 me, but it's like, um, something I picked up is like, uh, when you're worried about
00:28:09 doing a lot of work, being productive and then you're depressed and you don't feel
00:28:14 like you can do the work.
00:28:16 Um, and you say, or you're told you need a break, you need to give yourself a break.
00:28:21 And then during that break, quote unquote, you keep thinking about how all the time
00:28:25 that you could be spending doing the work, uh, you're physically not working, but you
00:28:31 are not on a break while you're thinking about it.
00:28:34 You're still mentally taxing yourself with the, the, the stuff that you should be doing.
00:28:39 An actual break is like to not think about it, to, to completely indulge in anything
00:28:46 else, to get your mind off it for real and not for a little bit, you know, for an actual
00:28:53 break length, which is why I've noticed when I, when I take a break, um, in a stupid way
00:29:00 and I'm like playing a game or doing a thing and I'm like, okay, this is just one day of
00:29:04 this.
00:29:05 And then I can back, back to work, back to work as fast as soon as possible because,
00:29:08 oh shit, all this time, uh, I hope, I sure hope this break doesn't take too long.
00:29:13 Like that sort of, that sort of mindset is like stressing yourself out and you haven't
00:29:17 actually started the break.
00:29:19 Your break time is zero.
00:29:21 And then you get back to work and it's like, oh, what the fuck?
00:29:23 I thought I had a break.
00:29:24 Why am I breaking, what am I breaking down immediately again?
00:29:27 It's just, it's all so fucking difficult.
00:29:32 You just got to actually fuck off.
00:29:38 Uh, I, on the, on the upside, on the upside, I am, um, I am nearly done with those fucking
00:29:48 book footnotes that I've been kind of working on here and there and like putting off and
00:29:55 putting, I've been putting them off a lot.
00:29:57 I don't know why I've been putting them off so much.
00:29:59 I should have gotten them done a long time ago.
00:30:01 I was like halfway done with them like three weeks ago.
00:30:04 And now I'm, I might, I'm genuinely, genuinely going to try and finish them like today after
00:30:09 this podcast because it's, I only have a little bit more to go.
00:30:12 They're like 20, it's like 21 pages.
00:30:14 It'll probably be like 22 by the time it's done, which is, I mean, that's kind of a
00:30:17 lot, but it's not that much.
00:30:20 The average is out to, I wrote like less than a page a day, which is not.
00:30:25 No, there you are doing like the spectacular.
00:30:28 You're thinking about all the productivity stuff.
00:30:31 Yeah.
00:30:32 It makes it harder to like get back into the swing of things if you're always like
00:30:35 shitting on yourself of things that have already happened.
00:30:40 Yeah, I know.
00:30:41 Yeah, I guess so.
00:30:43 It just feels like, it just feels like I haven't learned anything.
00:30:50 It feels like I should be, it feels like I should have figured out how to, how to get
00:30:56 my shit taken care of sooner than this.
00:31:01 I mean, when you're depressed, it's just not easy to do anything.
00:31:05 Yeah.
00:31:06 It's not like you can logic your way out of depression because it's not a logical state
00:31:10 of mind.
00:31:11 Like the, it's like a, what is the worst thing that I could possibly be thinking about myself
00:31:16 right now?
00:31:17 Oh, that, please think that over and over again.
00:31:21 It's not, it's not logical.
00:31:22 It's silly.
00:31:23 It's chemical imbalance.
00:31:24 It's dumb.
00:31:25 Maya.
00:31:26 Are you dumb then, Saint?
00:31:29 You know, that's a great, that's a great, let's explore that question for a while.
00:31:37 I think, I don't know, I've been, I feel like I'm pretty stupid lately.
00:31:43 Yeah.
00:31:44 I feel pretty, pretty dumb.
00:31:47 I think I have, you know, that secret project.
00:31:51 I think I've definitely fallen into a spiral of like infinitely preparing for it.
00:31:58 Like, like I was, I was ready to do it a couple of weeks ago and then it got delayed and I'm
00:32:03 like, okay, well this means that I can be even more prepared for it.
00:32:06 This means that I, and I think I have, I think I have fallen into a cycle of, you know.
00:32:14 A cycle of playing Mega Man and not even doing that.
00:32:20 Yeah.
00:32:21 A little bit partially, yeah.
00:32:27 I, you know, this is, this is not really related to that exactly.
00:32:34 I mean, that's, that's just, that's one thing that I'm like, I should, I should have done
00:32:38 that by now.
00:32:39 There's many things that I feel like I should have just done some things.
00:32:42 Why didn't I just do them?
00:32:45 I feel.
00:32:46 Because you weren't, you weren't mentally all there.
00:32:52 What's the term that isn't rude?
00:32:54 You weren't mentally like, I don't know, geared up to do that work, which is why you didn't
00:33:00 do it.
00:33:01 I guess so.
00:33:02 I mean, that's just, that's just how depression be.
00:33:06 I don't, I don't know.
00:33:07 I just, I think.
00:33:09 Like hypothetically, if, if, if we didn't have these, these problems, obviously we'd do more
00:33:15 work, because we wouldn't, we wouldn't be stopping to second guess every decision we make all
00:33:20 the time.
00:33:21 But that's not like, that's not reality.
00:33:25 Sometimes it is just, it's a blockage.
00:33:28 I think, I don't know.
00:33:31 I think I don't know enough to like give advice on that.
00:33:35 But I feel like, like the mindset of, oh, I should have done and why haven't I done is
00:33:42 like, it's, it's doesn't like, it doesn't like constructively get you closer to being able
00:33:54 to do what you think you can, or have done in the past.
00:33:59 Like, like I drew, what, like the whole of Lord of ghosts and almost the whole act one,
00:34:07 two Lord of ghosts and Clarissa in one year, within like a, in a few months stretch each.
00:34:14 I'm like, surely if I can do it that quickly, I should have finished all of those two years
00:34:21 later and have like a whole other thing going.
00:34:25 But I'm still like not doing that.
00:34:28 I'm still like fucking around.
00:34:32 But if I think about that too much, it just becomes more difficult to actually get back
00:34:37 to that level of, of productivity that I was.
00:34:41 So it's not helpful, I guess, to think that way.
00:34:45 I feel, I feel like, I don't know.
00:34:52 It's not, what worries me is like, it's not just that I'm not productive.
00:35:01 Like I've gone through like productive and unproductive spells and like, you know, whatever.
00:35:06 The fact that I didn't get the footnotes written until now and it's like too long,
00:35:11 like that's not great, but, but whatever.
00:35:15 It's gonna, it's gonna get done.
00:35:19 It bugs me out that like, I feel like I don't know, I feel like I don't have like anything to,
00:35:27 I feel like I don't like want anything.
00:35:30 Like I don't feel a strong drive to like, oh, when that's done, like I can't, I can finally get,
00:35:36 get to work on, on something else.
00:35:38 I don't know, I don't know, I don't even know like what I want to do after that's done anymore.
00:35:43 I had other things that I, that I wanted to work on.
00:35:46 And now I'm, I'm just like, I don't know.
00:35:51 I was gonna get back to like old projects, but like none of them ever took off and are they even worth doing anymore?
00:35:57 And if not them, then like, what else even is there to do?
00:36:02 I don't know, I'm kind of feeling like I've wasted my life lately.
00:36:06 Kind of, kind of feel like maybe I should have done something else.
00:36:12 I mean, what do you want to do?
00:36:14 I don't know, nothing, nothing, no, I can't.
00:36:17 I don't know, I don't know, I hate everything.
00:36:19 I hate everything.
00:36:20 I have no, I have no passion for anything.
00:36:22 I hate, I hate drawing.
00:36:24 I hate art.
00:36:26 I hate, I hate the, I kind of feel like I wish that I like had like written more.
00:36:35 Like maybe I like actually like wrote stuff like wrote essays.
00:36:39 I feel like maybe I used to be kind of okay at that, but I haven't done it in so long.
00:36:43 And like, I feel like I kind of deliberately avoided doing that.
00:36:48 Like I deliberately avoided like doing any sort of activity that would like carefully structure my thoughts on things.
00:36:56 And now I have like, and now my mind is completely disordered.
00:37:01 And like, all I have are like vague feelings, like things that make me angry.
00:37:07 But no like clear thoughts about anything.
00:37:12 And no desires or passions.
00:37:16 Do you feel compelled to like finish projects for no other reason than just a vague compulsion?
00:37:25 Because you do that and that's what people expect of you?
00:37:28 Sort of a little bit.
00:37:32 I mean, I feel like all the things that I started in the past,
00:37:40 I mean, there were reasons I wanted to finish them.
00:37:43 It's not like it's completely irrational.
00:37:46 But I mean, I do feel like I want to do that.
00:37:53 I do feel a sense of obligation to go back and finish old things.
00:37:59 A lot of them have built up and some of them I probably might never get to.
00:38:07 But some of them I feel like if I were more effective, I would finish them.
00:38:18 Some things I don't know even what I would do.
00:38:21 I feel like I don't even know what the champion would be if I went back to it and started working on it again.
00:38:27 I don't know what I would do with it anymore.
00:38:31 You have obligation based on past precedent, but you don't have motivation to do any of it.
00:38:38 Something like that.
00:38:40 You feel like if you were a better worker, if you were someone else, then it would be good that they get done.
00:38:50 Yeah.
00:38:53 Hypothetical question.
00:38:56 You're a Benz saint and you don't do any of those things.
00:39:01 How do you feel?
00:39:05 You decide not to do them ever and that actually is the case.
00:39:10 You don't ever go back to any of these things and you just live your life and that's the end.
00:39:16 How do you feel about that?
00:39:18 Like I decide, okay, I'll never do any more of the champion.
00:39:23 I'll never finish Biscopades.
00:39:25 I'll never finish my Winnie the Pooh retrospective.
00:39:27 I'll never make another Nuzlocke and I never kickstart the Slime and Punishment book.
00:39:38 All that.
00:39:40 All things you don't have motivation to do, which is everything.
00:39:44 Well, I guess I would feel like I wasted years and years of my life.
00:39:52 Well, would it be wasted if you didn't finish them?
00:39:57 What about the things you did do?
00:40:00 Yeah, sure.
00:40:04 Well, I guess I would just feel like there was lost potential there.
00:40:08 I think that I had started things and not finished them when they would be better if they had been completed
00:40:17 or seen through to a more logical conclusion.
00:40:22 Would you feel good if they were better?
00:40:24 Like if they were done?
00:40:26 Yeah.
00:40:28 Yeah, if that list of things that I just rattled off, if it was shorter, yeah, I think I would feel better.
00:40:39 Because if maybe there were just one or two things on the list, I would feel like, oh, I can just get to that.
00:40:44 I can just do it.
00:40:46 So if all of those things either abandoned or finished, what would Ben Saint be doing?
00:40:56 Oh, that's a great question.
00:40:58 I don't know.
00:41:01 I feel like, well, I guess I could maybe start a new comic project, but I don't know what it would be.
00:41:11 I have no ideas.
00:41:14 I could maybe start, I could try doing more writing essays, but I don't know what I would write them about.
00:41:23 I don't care enough about anything to write about it or think about anything.
00:41:29 So you're thinking of stuff you've already done doing more of that?
00:41:36 I could just quit doing the internet stuff and go get a job, but I don't know what I would want to do.
00:41:47 I've thought about that and even that.
00:41:51 I'm like, yeah, but what would be the point?
00:41:56 What about that would even give me joy?
00:42:01 What would you do with money?
00:42:04 I don't know.
00:42:05 I don't know what I would do with money.
00:42:09 I already can afford to live and what else do I need?
00:42:16 I don't know.
00:42:17 That's it.
00:42:18 Yeah.
00:42:20 I'm just struggling.
00:42:22 I don't know.
00:42:23 Well, surely there's things you do like, like the gummy creation that you seem passionate about.
00:42:30 I like that, but I feel bad.
00:42:36 It makes me feel bad that it's not more of a fruitful endeavor.
00:42:40 I don't really get anything out of it.
00:42:43 I guess I wasn't happy to.
00:42:44 You mean like money?
00:42:45 Yeah.
00:42:47 It's not like accomplishing anything.
00:42:50 It's just like a thing that I sort of do as a hobby.
00:42:55 I guess it's my hobby, you could say, but like, you know, I figured out a recipe that I'm happy with.
00:43:03 I made some gifts out of it, gave them to some people.
00:43:05 That was good.
00:43:06 That was gratifying, but like, well, I did it.
00:43:13 I feel like I would be more satisfied with that if I had an idea like, oh, okay.
00:43:20 Well, I finished the recipe now to the next step of my plan, but there isn't one.
00:43:28 Do you feel like there's no point doing anything if you don't have a larger plan to work towards?
00:43:33 Yeah.
00:43:36 Have you ever heard of Jesus twice?
00:43:38 No.
00:43:39 Maybe you could tell me about it.
00:43:41 I don't follow his plan.
00:43:45 Have you ever heard of this guy QAnon?
00:43:48 No.
00:43:49 He's posting again.
00:43:51 Oh, I love posting.
00:43:53 You had me at posting.
00:43:55 You had me at posting.
00:44:02 So, yeah, I just feel very unmotivated and very adrift and I don't know what I even want to do with my life anymore.
00:44:21 I have thought about this a lot, this sort of thing.
00:44:27 A friend of mine talked to me about how I'm beating myself up over things like, what's the point if I can't make it a career?
00:44:40 Or if I can't increase in skill enough to do well for it to be worthwhile for me or other people.
00:44:50 It's usually a down to money.
00:44:52 It's also down to satisfying myself.
00:44:56 And they were like, do you accept yourself existing?
00:45:05 Aside from accomplishments, past and present, future, do you accept that you are allowed to exist?
00:45:16 And I realized, talking about it, I feel like I don't.
00:45:20 I don't think of myself as worthy unless I have accomplishments under my belt or that I can work towards getting money, notoriety, skill, self-satisfaction, fame through art that I make.
00:45:39 I don't feel like I could live with myself if I didn't do any of those things.
00:45:44 And they said that was an unhealthy mindset that you should be able to hypothetically accept yourself and that's it.
00:45:55 There's no prerequisite.
00:45:57 There's no bar you need to reach.
00:46:02 You don't need to do anything and you should be able to be okay with that.
00:46:06 And that's tough.
00:46:08 I still don't know really how to do that, but it's helped to think about it a couple times where it's like, if I stopped doing everything that I'm doing, would I be okay with it?
00:46:22 How do I accept who I am?
00:46:26 Because when there's no motivation to do anything, there's no reason to do it.
00:46:31 You feel like there's like, what's the point of everything you could possibly do?
00:46:36 Everything left is like nothing and then are you okay with that? Are you okay with nothing?
00:46:42 Yeah, not really, no.
00:46:46 I feel like I could be doing something that means something or matters or contributes to the world in some way and I don't feel like I'm doing enough.
00:47:01 And I feel like it's a waste.
00:47:04 Like I said, I feel like I've wasted my life.
00:47:09 If you know what I mean.
00:47:11 Yeah.
00:47:13 I think it's something to mull over at least.
00:47:16 Oh, I will.
00:47:18 Don't worry.
00:47:19 Because being, I don't know, like requiring yourself to reach certain standards of worthiness for you to feel okay causes you to never do anything because you're so upset with yourself.
00:47:38 And it's not so much that you should accept yourself as a hypothetical do nothing person for the purposes of being productive later.
00:47:50 But that does tend to happen when somebody is like, it's like the whole like, oh, nothing matters.
00:48:00 But they got sunglasses on.
00:48:02 They're like, yeah, nothing matters.
00:48:04 When you reach that point.
00:48:06 It's like a funny thing looking at it but to actually reach that point you need to genuinely like feel like if nothing happens and you don't you don't do anything then that's cool too.
00:48:21 And then it's easier to just do something for no reason.
00:48:33 I think the past couple years, you know, I think a lot of what gave me, you know, what gave me a sense of motivation to do anything was like, I don't know, a couple of my videos or whatever got pretty popular people knew me, people like knew about that stuff.
00:48:57 And I had like some recognition for those things and people wanted to talk to me about those things.
00:49:04 And like, it's not that I was like super, it's not that I was like super invested in the things that like, I don't know, Chris Chan or a unicorn jelly or whatever or tails gets trolled.
00:49:16 It's not that I like love those things passionately and want to talk about them but just like the fact that people knew me for something and wanted to talk to me about something.
00:49:29 I was passionate about that.
00:49:31 That gave me motivation.
00:49:34 And in the absence of that, like the things themselves don't mean anything.
00:49:40 And I guess I could try to like do that again.
00:49:45 Think of something random that is not actually important, but like try and do something with it that gets people to be like, oh, hey, Ben, you did that thing about the thing I like.
00:49:57 Well, let's, I have an opinion about that.
00:50:00 Let's have a dialogue and I'll be like, okay.
00:50:02 You get a little envelope.
00:50:03 I like dialogues.
00:50:04 You get a little envelope.
00:50:06 You open it up saying, hey, Ben Saint, I saw your video.
00:50:09 Now you can live.
00:50:10 Now you feel like you're worth something.
00:50:13 Sure.
00:50:14 Yeah.
00:50:15 That's like my hog, my version of the Hogwarts letter.
00:50:19 Yeah.
00:50:20 Yeah.
00:50:21 Yeah.
00:50:22 Only it's better because it's not from JK.
00:50:26 Yeah.
00:50:27 So it's, it's, yeah, I felt like that as well.
00:50:30 Yeah.
00:50:31 But it does lead to, to feeling that if it's unlikely that people will care to not do anything, which I guess is a lot of what you're feeling with like, oh, I haven't streamed in a while and my momentum is down.
00:50:49 So there's going to be less people who are going to be affected by my streaming if I continue, if I started up again.
00:50:55 It's like, well, if people aren't going to say Ben Saint, I love your streams, what's the point of starting it up again?
00:51:01 I've lost everything.
00:51:03 Exactly.
00:51:04 You're exactly, that's a great point you just made.
00:51:07 I couldn't agree more with it.
00:51:09 Well said.
00:51:11 No.
00:51:13 It's a bad thing to think that.
00:51:16 Well, I mean, bad and good is whatever.
00:51:19 I just think it might be.
00:51:20 There's actually no difference between good and bad things.
00:51:22 You idiot.
00:51:23 Yeah.
00:51:24 Yeah.
00:51:26 I just, I felt like it's, it's been something I have to try and get away from hoping like to get validation from exclusively outside is, it sucks when it doesn't work, when you're not getting constant love and attention.
00:51:46 And as soon as you're left on your own and your momentum is gone, you feel like there's no reason for anything because you don't know how to like feel accepting of yourself as a person who isn't making big fat stacks and loads of views and clicks.
00:52:01 As Zero would say, what is it?
00:52:04 What is the line?
00:52:06 Zero subs.
00:52:07 Oh, no, it's like, uh, well, it's like this, this can't be happening.
00:52:14 There's no reason to go on.
00:52:16 What am I fighting for?
00:52:20 Yeah, you know, what are you fighting for zero Ben?
00:52:25 And nothing, nothing, just, just to live and feel cool about myself.
00:52:30 That's the only two things I want.
00:52:32 You just want to stay alive and I want to feel like I'm cool.
00:52:36 And I'm only managing the first one.
00:52:39 It's not enough.
00:52:41 You got to feel cool by being alive.
00:52:47 You got to, you got to find the, the, the self acceptance.
00:52:59 Ben Saint, the zero subscriber boy.
00:53:01 What do you think?
00:53:03 Oh, pathetic, pathetic.
00:53:06 No.
00:53:08 He's valid.
00:53:09 What's even, what's the point?
00:53:11 What's the point?
00:53:12 Yeah, sure.
00:53:13 He's alive.
00:53:14 But what's, what has he, what has he ever contributed?
00:53:16 What has he ever done for anyone?
00:53:18 He doesn't need to.
00:53:20 Does he not?
00:53:21 No.
00:53:22 I don't, I don't care about anyone I've never heard of.
00:53:26 So if no one's ever heard of me, then nobody cares.
00:53:29 And what's the point?
00:53:30 Well, that's the whole thing.
00:53:32 If you're living in a vacuum and you don't care about you, there's no one else to do it.
00:53:37 You just got to do it.
00:53:39 You got to love yourself, Ben.
00:53:42 You dumb motherfucker.
00:53:44 Um, yeah, I mean, I guess you're right.
00:53:52 Yeah, but yeah.
00:53:54 It's difficult to do it, but like knowing that that's something to work on is important.
00:54:05 I, I just, um, I guess, I guess I just, you know what, I guess I just wish.
00:54:12 I think even if, you know, it's not, it's not so much a clout thing.
00:54:16 It's not like, oh, I don't have enough clout.
00:54:18 It's not even that.
00:54:19 I wish that I had something, I wish I knew what I felt passionate about.
00:54:27 Something that I like, I wake up, something that makes me wake up and I'm like, I can't
00:54:30 wait to do that thing that I do today.
00:54:33 Like I got something I'm working on and I'm like, I gotta get back to it.
00:54:37 I, I haven't felt that way about anything in a while.
00:54:41 And when you have something like that, it doesn't matter if you're, if you're fucking,
00:54:48 if your video got a lot of views or whatever.
00:54:51 It's just, it's just like, it's, there's a reason to go on.
00:54:55 What am I fighting for?
00:54:59 I don't know if this is like a common thought.
00:55:05 Probably is, but I feel like a way to do that, a way to find purpose in something is to think
00:55:16 selflessly about someone else to like, I don't know, to help someone else with their problem
00:55:26 and forget about your own for a bit.
00:55:29 And it's, it's easier to like find passion to get that done than it is to, to love yourself.
00:55:38 And it's sort of, I don't know, it helps kickstart things.
00:55:44 If it, you know, if it's difficult to like create a gratitude from nothing, if you're
00:55:50 just sitting there doing nothing and I'm like, well, I'm not making anyone's life better.
00:55:55 And I don't like myself just sitting here.
00:55:57 So it's, what am I supposed to do?
00:55:59 You can just like, service someone else, be, be there for someone else.
00:56:06 Oh, okay.
00:56:07 Oh, yeah.
00:56:08 I mean, you could suck a dick or two.
00:56:09 I mean, I don't care.
00:56:10 Sure.
00:56:11 You do, you do what you like.
00:56:12 If that's what gets you out of bed in the morning.
00:56:14 Yeah.
00:56:15 Like, I mean, did T-Bab, you, I mean, T-Bab was like a joint venture.
00:56:23 And so you had the, the, the sense of doing it because you were doing it, but also Nate
00:56:29 was doing it.
00:56:30 And so you were helping Nate and he was helping you to make the show.
00:56:34 That's so it was, it was easier to stay motivated and get motivated because you were, you were
00:56:39 helping someone while you were doing it.
00:56:41 That's true.
00:56:42 That is true.
00:56:43 I mean, even for the PCP, like it's easier to come on the show when there's someone else
00:56:52 to talk to you because I'm not just doing a podcast for myself.
00:56:56 I'm, I'm there to be part of the show.
00:56:59 Man, I don't know what I would do if like it was just me.
00:57:02 I don't know if I would have the fortitude to carry on with it.
00:57:07 Yeah.
00:57:08 Sorry, I wasn't there last time.
00:57:10 No, it's okay.
00:57:11 It was a Father's Day thing, but I also sort of forgot.
00:57:14 It's understood.
00:57:15 I mean, yeah, it's fine.
00:57:16 I'm not, I'm not saying like, am I saying every Ben cast is a, is a, is a tragedy that
00:57:23 like devastates my self-esteem.
00:57:25 Well, I'm not going to say it out loud, but no, I don't care.
00:57:30 No, it's fine.
00:57:32 But my point was just like, you know, I mean, I don't know.
00:57:36 I don't know if, if I could be like, well, I'm the only, I'm the only procrastinator
00:57:41 left that I'm just going to keep showing up every week and rambling into a microphone.
00:57:46 I don't know if I, if I could do that.
00:57:49 Yeah.
00:57:50 But like you said, like you said with TBAP, it was like, it wasn't just to get the project
00:57:57 done.
00:57:58 It was we are, we both are working on this thing and I must do it not just for myself,
00:58:07 but for my, my partner as well in this, in this business venture.
00:58:14 And that was helpful.
00:58:17 It was.
00:58:19 And, you know, okay, what you're saying about like, think about how you can help someone
00:58:29 else.
00:58:30 Like I, I agree.
00:58:32 I feel like I don't know what value I have to offer someone because all I can do, this
00:58:41 is why I say, this is why I feel like I've wasted my life because what, because what
00:58:44 can I do?
00:58:45 I can, I can draw kind of.
00:58:49 And that's it.
00:58:50 I used to be, I used to be good.
00:58:53 I don't think I am funny.
00:58:55 I don't feel like I'm funny.
00:58:56 I feel like sometimes I'm funny by accident, but I'm not, I would not, I'm not like a comedian.
00:59:01 I'm not like a, I don't like make jokes.
00:59:03 Well, I don't mean like it.
00:59:04 I mean, like just talking to someone.
00:59:06 Like it's, you're fun to talk to.
00:59:07 I do, I do feel, well, I don't know.
00:59:11 Sometimes, sometimes I feel like I'm pretty good at talking to people and like I can be,
00:59:15 and like I can be, I don't know, charming.
00:59:19 I'm sorry.
00:59:20 I don't mean to tube my own horn.
00:59:21 I feel like I can be, I don't feel like it's a, it's a huge boast to say.
00:59:25 I feel like I can be charming and that's fine.
00:59:28 That's, that's good.
00:59:29 I guess that's, that's a quality.
00:59:31 I don't know what to do with that.
00:59:33 I don't feel like that's value that I could give somebody.
00:59:37 A value would be if I could, if I could, like if, I don't know, if I could write something
00:59:44 that was really like insightful and people could get something out of it and be like,
00:59:48 ah, this, Ben has had an idea here that has taught me something or clarified my own thinking.
00:59:54 Or I mean, it doesn't have to be writing.
00:59:56 If I could do that through art somehow, I guess that would be fine too.
01:00:00 I don't know how to do that.
01:00:03 That's why I say I have no ideas because I don't know what would be like a valuable activity
01:00:12 I could be participating in that other people would get something out of.
01:00:19 I guess the most straightforward thing to do would be if I like got a job
01:00:25 and then I would be giving value to my employer in the form of wage labor in exchange for, for a wage.
01:00:34 But I don't want to do that because I hate capitalism.
01:00:37 And I would see that as an evil.
01:00:39 I would, I would, unless there were some side benefit to it, unless I were achieving some other thing,
01:00:44 by that I would see that as like a net evil that I was inflicting on the world
01:00:48 by moving capital into the hands of a, of a bourgeois fucker.
01:00:55 You know what I mean?
01:00:57 I do know what you mean.
01:00:59 I've seen these videos on YouTube of like people powerwashing random people's driveways for free
01:01:11 and then making videos about it and getting paid via the videos.
01:01:15 So they have their powerwashing equipment and they go by, they drive by,
01:01:19 they see somebody's like got a really dark and dirty like overgrown sort of driveway front porch area
01:01:29 and they just go knock on the door and say, hey, I'll do this for free and they do it for free.
01:01:35 And then they leave and it's, it's, it's a nice feeling thing.
01:01:40 It's also very satisfying just ASMR just powerwashing something, seeing everything become cleaner.
01:01:45 And so it's like, it's revenue for them so they can exist in capitalism,
01:01:50 but they're not like taking anything from anybody in the community.
01:01:56 It's, it's, it's nice.
01:01:59 I always thought like that would be a nice job, kind of.
01:02:03 I don't have anything like that.
01:02:05 I gotta say, that sounds completely ridiculous.
01:02:12 I don't think that sounds stupid.
01:02:14 I'm not suggesting you get a powerwashing equipment.
01:02:17 I'm being perfectly honest.
01:02:19 No, it's great.
01:02:20 Look how clean that, that concrete is.
01:02:22 Okay.
01:02:23 It's not, people aren't going to slip on it anymore.
01:02:26 That's true, I guess.
01:02:29 It's not just dirty.
01:02:30 It's like overgrown with like, like, like a, like a walkways like covered with years of mud falling onto it.
01:02:38 And when they clear it, it's just better for people to walk on.
01:02:42 I don't know.
01:02:43 All right.
01:02:44 Okay.
01:02:45 So it's a civic, this is like basically like a civic sort of volunteer.
01:02:51 Yeah, it's volunteer work.
01:02:53 But via YouTube, they can, they can fund it.
01:02:56 Yeah.
01:02:57 It's just sort of a nice thing about YouTube, I guess.
01:03:00 Who would watch that?
01:03:02 Me and thousands of millions of people, honestly.
01:03:05 Commentary, is someone like commentating the cleanup job that they did?
01:03:09 I think it's just sort of an inherently satisfying thing, watching something be cleaned.
01:03:14 Is it like a time lapse?
01:03:15 Like you watch, like you watch the area become cleaner?
01:03:20 Yeah.
01:03:21 Like they set up the camera and they do it in first speed and they just sort of spread,
01:03:28 splash all the water and they get all the grain gone.
01:03:33 And sometimes they commentate over bits, but most of the videos I've seen people just like
01:03:38 watching it slowly be cleared.
01:03:40 It's like, ah, yeah.
01:03:42 Cleanliness.
01:03:43 Oh, I'm parking.
01:03:45 I mean, I can understand the appeal of watching something, watching a transition from disorder
01:03:54 to order.
01:03:56 That's an inherently satisfying thing to witness.
01:04:02 But like, I don't know, I was, in terms of like, oh shit, what was I talking about?
01:04:12 I think I was saying something about like jobs.
01:04:16 I don't know.
01:04:17 Yeah, you don't want to be a capitalism wage slave.
01:04:19 I don't.
01:04:20 I don't.
01:04:21 That's the first thing you can think of to help.
01:04:22 That's the most straightforward way of like, oh, Ben, how could you feel like you were actually
01:04:27 accomplishing something?
01:04:28 How could you feel like you weren't wasting your life?
01:04:31 It's like, well, if I, if I just got a job, then I would be doing something.
01:04:36 But also, I don't, I think, I don't think like a lot, you know, a lot of people say like,
01:04:45 oh, just get a job.
01:04:47 And like, then you'll be contributing something.
01:04:49 And I don't agree with that because most jobs, well, a lot of jobs are worthless.
01:04:55 A lot of jobs exist like solely to just like solve a problem that like the company that is hiring you created for themselves.
01:05:04 Right.
01:05:05 Sure.
01:05:06 Bullshit jobs as the late Graeber wrote.
01:05:10 But I mean, that's why I mentioned the thing because it's like these, it's not just power washing.
01:05:17 It's like there's this guy who clearly very autistic, but loves clearing drains that have flooded and they've got like Schmaltz started like blocking the drain.
01:05:30 And he's just going around the side of the road, usually in the rain.
01:05:33 And he's got like his like scraping tool.
01:05:35 And he's like, oh, we got to go to clear this drain here.
01:05:38 And then you watch his like a whirlpool form and the water goes down and he just does that in the local community.
01:05:44 And the people around like know him and he makes his videos and people just love seeing like the it's it's selfless.
01:05:53 It's like it's hard labor, but it's serving the local community.
01:05:57 And it's just sort of, you know, it's it's making places safer.
01:06:02 It's solving problems where bureaucracy might get in the way and like a guy would never come around to fix these things.
01:06:09 If he didn't.
01:06:10 Yeah.
01:06:11 And it's just sort of like that's the sort of work that is gratifying is is helping people locally in ways that like capital bureaucracy doesn't help.
01:06:27 Just like, I don't know, like clearing somebody's driveway of snow, if they are too old to do it themselves like some some small thing like that makes you feel good.
01:06:39 If it's not like commercially viable.
01:06:43 Yeah, I don't know.
01:06:44 I don't know if that's sounds that appealing.
01:06:48 Look, I'm gonna.
01:06:49 Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying you should do any of these things, but like, right, sure.
01:06:54 Jobs aren't all bullshit.
01:06:57 There are there are things you can find.
01:07:00 I'm sure it's just volunteer work that you do like part time, you know.
01:07:05 Yeah, I just if I feel like if I had something, if I feel like if I knew what I wanted to be doing and I were doing it or I were doing anything that I felt strongly about, then what would naturally I feel like what would naturally
01:07:20 happen then is that I would feel is that I would have things happen.
01:07:26 Things would happen in my life that I would have feelings about and that I could talk about and that I could, I don't know.
01:07:34 And maybe and maybe then I would feel strongly enough about something to like write an essay about it and make a video about it or something like that.
01:07:45 So, or or.
01:07:49 Yeah.
01:07:51 But in but instead I'm like, well, I don't I'm not doing much.
01:07:58 I'm kind of just wrapping up old stuff that I did before.
01:08:02 I'm not doing anything new and I'm not like engaged in any like exciting new projects or I'm not working towards anything really at the moment and and therefore I have nothing to say.
01:08:20 And it's like, and it is a self reinforcing problem and then the fact that I have nothing to say about anything.
01:08:30 It's like, well, I won't.
01:08:32 I'll just, I guess I'll just won't say anything and then there's no.
01:08:39 I don't know.
01:08:40 There's no push and pull of forces that would compel me to act in any particular way and I'm just like, well, I guess I just going to just going to keep existing then.
01:08:57 You're an art.
01:08:59 Yeah, which is like, I guess I should be.
01:09:02 I guess I should be happy to theoretically accept the existence of a Ben that doesn't do anything, but I'm not.
01:09:13 But I feel like maybe I'm talking in circles now.
01:09:19 I understand, like the whole like, I don't get how I could accept myself if I don't do anything.
01:09:29 I think part of the thought process you're supposed to go down is like realizing that doing nothing is bad.
01:09:39 And so you want to be doing something that's productive or good for who and that's why it's like help someone.
01:09:47 And even if it's like you don't use your skills in the most efficient way, something as simple as just being there for somebody that you know, or like talking with someone.
01:10:05 Small things that are like selfless and just provide whatever you got to someone else will like kickstart a feeling of, I don't know, feeling like you can, you can help you can do things.
01:10:27 And it's sort of ideally spirals into feeling better about yourself in general because you can you have value to other people.
01:10:40 And it's like, I don't I'm not like explaining it the best.
01:10:45 I mean, it's not like you can just like get it like figure it out after one conversation on a podcast, but it's a it's better than being sad all the time.
01:10:59 Okay, I don't know.
01:11:10 I don't know what I don't know what it is that I want to hear.
01:11:14 No, neither do I.
01:11:16 Yeah, like I don't know what I want to hear either.
01:11:19 I feel like maybe I'm helping.
01:11:24 This is a therapy session.
01:11:25 I'm the therapist now.
01:11:27 I have been the therapist.
01:11:29 I am.
01:11:30 I know that they say that like, I guess they say that like, when you have a problem sometimes it's best to like, how would if someone else came to you and told you that they have the exact problem that you have.
01:11:44 Like what would you tell them?
01:11:46 Like what what would your advice to someone else in the exact same position as you're in be.
01:11:52 And I guess I guess what I would tell myself is like, oh God, I don't I have to I'd have to get I don't know, man.
01:12:04 I have to give myself some platitudes like, well, you just got to find you just got to find what what you're passionate about.
01:12:11 You just got to find something that excites you.
01:12:15 Oh, you just got to like, yeah.
01:12:19 What else?
01:12:20 What else could I say?
01:12:21 I know.
01:12:22 But like, um, that's that's the sort of thing that's not what you want to hear from someone else.
01:12:28 No, no, no.
01:12:29 So how what would you say to yourself the thing you want to hear?
01:12:39 What I what I'd like, what I'd like to hear is like, what I'd like to hear is like, hey, hey, Ben, you know what, I've looked over your resume.
01:12:50 I've looked over your skill set.
01:12:51 I've looked over everything you've you've done in your life.
01:12:53 And I've just and I have I have a I have the perfect job for you that is going to that is going that is perfectly suits all of your skills, all of your abilities, and also includes a kick my microphone and also because full dental insurance.
01:13:08 You start on Monday.
01:13:14 Ben, that's a capitalist job.
01:13:17 I'm a how can you live with it?
01:13:19 I would I it's like I said, I would I would a job would be fine.
01:13:23 It's not that I think jobs are bad.
01:13:25 It's just that I think bad jobs are bad.
01:13:27 I would like a job that was good and that had me doing work that I cared about.
01:13:35 So what's your skill set?
01:13:37 I don't know.
01:13:38 I mean drawing.
01:13:41 I feel like I can I feel like I'm okay at like I feel like I'm like drawing and writing dialogue.
01:13:49 I feel like I'm pretty decent at naturalistic dialogue.
01:13:52 I feel like I could like storyboard for a show or something.
01:13:56 I feel like I could do something like that or it could be like a presenter.
01:14:02 I don't know.
01:14:03 I feel like I'm pretty good at just talking off the cuff.
01:14:05 I could present.
01:14:08 I could I could lecture.
01:14:09 I feel like I could give like lectures in like a classroom maybe.
01:14:12 I hate although I mean I when I was it when I worked as a teacher before like I didn't I didn't like it.
01:14:18 I like talking.
01:14:20 I didn't like like lesson plans.
01:14:21 I didn't like answering questions.
01:14:23 I didn't like explaining things.
01:14:26 I didn't actually like the teaching part of it.
01:14:28 I found it really frustrating.
01:14:31 I mean it seems like like video essayist as like maybe like the YouTube cringe as it is seems like you would enjoy doing.
01:14:46 Yeah.
01:14:47 I wish I could do it.
01:14:48 But like I would like I can't you.
01:14:50 Oh well I would have to write something and I don't know.
01:14:54 I don't care about anything.
01:14:56 I feel like I would have to care about something in order to have something to say about it.
01:15:00 And then I could write it and then I could make a video about it.
01:15:04 And that's what I'm that's what I'm missing.
01:15:06 Well.
01:15:07 Yeah.
01:15:08 I don't know.
01:15:09 I'm sorry.
01:15:10 No I mean it's not like I expected us to figure that out.
01:15:15 Like.
01:15:18 Yeah.
01:15:20 I feel like with me my problems late my problems all boiled down to just like a lack of motivation to do anything.
01:15:27 If I could if only I could solve that if only that one that one Lego brick could snap into place.
01:15:35 The everything else could become could be erected around it if you know what I'm saying.
01:15:44 Well I mean I think we're going in circles now we are going in circles.
01:15:49 The motivation if you have nothing if you have nothing you care about then caring about someone else's problem and trying to help them.
01:15:58 Right.
01:15:59 Sure.
01:16:00 Right.
01:16:01 It's like it's a way to start.
01:16:02 Yeah.
01:16:03 If you don't know what you're doing someone else is doing something.
01:16:07 Yeah.
01:16:10 Well that's great.
01:16:14 I don't know.
01:16:15 I don't even I don't even know what that would look like.
01:16:20 I mean when I think about like.
01:16:23 It could be as simple as just.
01:16:26 I really.
01:16:27 You know asking people how they're doing.
01:16:33 Yeah.
01:16:34 Sure.
01:16:35 I mean whatever.
01:16:36 That's not something to do with your life.
01:16:41 It can become I think I think the motivation like passion for things usually comes from experiences that you have.
01:16:51 Not thoughts that you come up with like in a vacuum just like no no love for anything sitting in a blank room and then suddenly you decide to care about something that like like it's doesn't work like that.
01:17:06 Out in the real world things happen and eventually you like have strong opinions.
01:17:13 Yeah.
01:17:14 Like OK I've got to do this and then suddenly you're motivated to do one thing.
01:17:21 Yeah I know I agree.
01:17:30 Well I agree but I don't know what else to say about it.
01:17:37 Yeah.
01:17:39 Do you want to hear about my fucking house hunting that I've been.
01:17:45 Oh yeah.
01:17:46 Tell me.
01:17:47 Yeah I've been I've been shooting off emails to people on Craigslist and it's been going OK.
01:17:56 I've seen I've seen two houses so far and they're one of them was one of them seemed like it was about as shit as my current place so I wasn't that excited about it.
01:18:07 One of them seemed better but a little bit more expensive and a little bit less a little bit less convenient like location wise but not that much less convenient and like maybe OK I don't know.
01:18:21 Part of me wants to just like jump on that and just be like I don't even want to look at any more places like second places saw like and it's adequate like I'll take it.
01:18:34 I got it.
01:18:35 How does it compare to the things you've seen to your current situation.
01:18:42 Well it's better than my better than my current situation.
01:18:46 I would say.
01:18:52 I got it actually.
01:18:55 So I think some guy has been impersonating the landlord from that place.
01:19:01 Here's here's a weird thing that happened.
01:19:04 So I went to see that place.
01:19:06 A guy who lived there showed me around.
01:19:08 He was like OK.
01:19:11 You should OK if you if you're interested in the place contact contact Ross Ross is the name of like not not the owner but the property manager like the guy that manages for the owner.
01:19:24 I'm like OK.
01:19:25 So and then I get another email or maybe it was a text message.
01:19:32 I don't even remember from someone being like hey my email is like Ross something at something.
01:19:41 You know message me back and I assumed it was the same Ross.
01:19:46 So I message him back.
01:19:47 He's like he's like send it to me on my send me an email at my personal email this other email.
01:19:51 I'm like OK so I contact him and he's like and he starts asking me like Ben sign up for this website like sign up for this website like pay a subscription fee.
01:20:00 Like sign up for this website and get like and show me a screenshot of like the information it gives you and that's what you got to do to sign up for the property and I ask him like are like are you.
01:20:12 And he's he asked me if I want to see that I'm like I already I already saw the property like what are you talking about are you.
01:20:19 I think he was a scammer or something and I and I and I told him like I think you're a scammer and he said like and he the way that I know that he's a scammer is that when I told him.
01:20:30 You're a scammer.
01:20:31 He continued to ask me like OK but if you want the property like you got to you got to sign up for this website like you got to you got to send me that.
01:20:38 And I like that's not something that like a real a real person would would take would be called a scammer and be like well I guess our business is concluded then.
01:20:48 You're like a mouse sniffing a mousetrap.
01:20:50 You say this is a mousetrap.
01:20:51 And it's like yeah OK but if you want the cheese you really have no no I'm not.
01:20:55 Yes yes yes.
01:20:57 I don't know why this guy wants me to does this guy work on commission to get people to sign up for this fucking website.
01:21:04 It's I don't know very very sus but I asked the guy that showed me the place and I asked him like I asked him is this the guy.
01:21:14 And he said he said yeah it should be him but then he gave me his phone number so I texted the guy's phone number and I don't think it's him like I really hope it's not him.
01:21:26 That would be really creepy.
01:21:29 The guy the guy seems the place seemed fine I would I don't know.
01:21:34 There's no way that like a legit landlord would ask you like hey go sign up for a paid subscription website that will tell you like if you're a good renter and then send me a screenshot of your home page.
01:21:47 It's insane.
01:21:48 There's no way there's no way that's a real thing I refuse to believe it.
01:21:51 Legit landlord I don't know if those exist.
01:21:53 Right right well sorry.
01:22:01 Anyway there was another place I was.
01:22:04 They wanted me to come see it this morning but I told them like I can't do it on Sunday mornings and so they said like okay well I'll contact you and tell you another time you can come see it if it's still available and like fine.
01:22:16 So I don't know.
01:22:18 Might just jump on that might just jump on that that's second place.
01:22:25 Because whatever.
01:22:30 Well I hope the move is.
01:22:33 My bullshit free.
01:22:36 My current landlord will certainly give me some bullshit there is certainly going to be some nonsense where.
01:22:42 She wants me she wants me to give her more money than than I actually need she's going to want me she's going to want me to pay the last month's rent even though I already paid the last month's rent when I moved in.
01:22:55 She's going to expect that she should be able to keep my security deposit on top of you know the 12 months rent that I should rightfully pay even though I didn't do anything fucked up to the to the room or whatever.
01:23:09 There's going to be some bullshit.
01:23:14 But I'll just fucking have to deal with it.
01:23:19 Came home from a thing the other day and the landlady and her husband who I had never seen before were in my kitchen.
01:23:28 They were they had gone into my room.
01:23:32 They had opened my door and looked in my room which upset me a lot and I complained to them I was like you can't do this like you like you need to give me notice I didn't get any notice.
01:23:42 And the guy was like oh sorry sorry.
01:23:47 And I was mad and they knew I was mad but they didn't know what to say.
01:23:51 And then the guy came back and he knocked on my door and he showed me an email and he had he had in fact sent like a group email to everyone that lives in my house.
01:24:02 So there had been an email notification I just hadn't seen it because it was like one day before.
01:24:07 And I just like shit.
01:24:11 This doesn't make me happy.
01:24:13 This like this doesn't make me feel better.
01:24:15 I guess it means you're technically right.
01:24:18 But I still don't like it.
01:24:28 So I don't know they're going to they're going to there's they're going to try and get away with everything get away with.
01:24:34 And that's just I've accepted that.
01:24:40 I ended up I ended up regretting not just picking a place that I found like right away not just jumping on be like I'll take it it's good enough I'll take it.
01:24:51 I'm debating what I don't know like is this is the place I found already is it good enough that I need to do that.
01:24:56 I'll I'll be honest.
01:24:58 I don't know.
01:25:00 I last last year when I was looking for places I thought like I don't know I kind of thought like it would matter.
01:25:08 I kind of thought it would matter like if my place was nice or anything.
01:25:13 I don't know.
01:25:14 I don't know.
01:25:15 I don't know if I even care if my place is nice.
01:25:18 What's the point.
01:25:19 What's the point of a nice place.
01:25:21 You know if my come you live there and if it sucks then you hate it.
01:25:27 I don't know.
01:25:28 I feel like I feel like even if it's even if it sucks or it's nice or whatever I'm still going to do the same shit.
01:25:35 I was just going to do the same shit.
01:25:38 It's just going to sit around and accomplish nothing either way.
01:25:41 That's how that's how I'm thinking.
01:25:43 That's how my thinking is right now.
01:25:45 And it's probably not.
01:25:47 But yeah but hypothetically suddenly Ben St.
01:25:51 You got like motivation back.
01:25:53 All right.
01:25:54 But you're in an ugly place that sucks.
01:25:56 It's harder to do stuff.
01:25:58 I guess that's true.
01:25:59 I may as well be nicer.
01:26:01 I would be setting myself up for success.
01:26:05 Yeah.
01:26:06 To have a slightly nicer.
01:26:07 Rent for the life you want.
01:26:09 That's true.
01:26:10 That's true.
01:26:19 Maybe.
01:26:22 I guess I'll send off maybe a few more.
01:26:25 If I send off a few more emails go check out a few more places and maybe then if none of them measure up to this place then I'll jump in it.
01:26:31 But that's what I said last time.
01:26:33 And all it took was a few days before the place was not available anymore.
01:26:38 And it's like I want to wait and see.
01:26:42 I want to wait and see.
01:26:43 But I can't.
01:26:46 Place could be gone already.
01:26:48 Place could be gone already.
01:26:49 I just don't know.
01:26:51 Yeah.
01:26:52 Things are.
01:26:53 From what I've heard.
01:26:55 From you and like from other people.
01:26:58 Renting.
01:26:59 Is.
01:27:00 It's it's almost like.
01:27:03 Built to force you to make snap judgments and buy the place because.
01:27:09 It moves so quickly.
01:27:12 Yeah.
01:27:13 I mean.
01:27:14 Landlords just they just want to get the room filled.
01:27:17 They're just like.
01:27:18 We just want to make absolutely sure there's no like downtime where nobody is.
01:27:23 Is renting it so.
01:27:26 Yeah.
01:27:30 That means that like as a renter you're like well.
01:27:33 You better be you better be the first acceptable.
01:27:37 Person to ask to rent the place because they'll give it they'll.
01:27:40 They want you.
01:27:42 Yeah.
01:27:43 The like.
01:27:45 It's so quick.
01:27:47 If they're like oh there's a land mine in the bathroom but you didn't have a chance to see that.
01:27:52 When you looked around the house the first time.
01:27:55 And then you're like sure it's fine you get it.
01:27:58 And then go into the bathroom explode and die and the whole building crumbles.
01:28:02 The guy showing me around the house told me we went to the basement.
01:28:06 And he told me like.
01:28:09 He told me like yeah you know years and years ago.
01:28:13 There used to be like there used to be like house shows down here in the basement like they used to do you know like bands.
01:28:20 Like they used to have parties with like hundreds of people down here.
01:28:23 I can't imagine how it was wasn't that big a basement I can't imagine how hundreds of people fit but I could.
01:28:28 I you know I'm sure you could fit a lot of people if you really wanted to.
01:28:33 So we said that.
01:28:35 And I was like okay it sounds pretty cool.
01:28:37 And he was like yeah you know things are things are quieted down a lot you know since the pandemic and all.
01:28:43 And I was like that's that's great.
01:28:46 And it just and it just made me feel like I'm living in the post apocalypse.
01:28:51 And what reason is there to go on what am I fighting for.
01:28:56 That's the title of the episode.
01:28:59 Yeah I think what are we fighting for.
01:29:03 I don't know what I'm saying.
01:29:05 Did I say what that's a reference to do you know did I explain that.
01:29:08 You said is Mega Man zero something something in Mega Man X five in zeros campaign.
01:29:15 There's a part where zero has to fight his girlfriend I guess and she dies and he holds her body up and he yells this can't be happening.
01:29:26 There's no reason to go on.
01:29:28 What am I fighting for.
01:29:33 Amazing dub on that game the best.
01:29:38 Oh like voice acted.
01:29:40 Yeah they they it's if you ever see clips from X five in particular they really what console is on that's on PlayStation.
01:29:49 They it was yeah it was in the era where like they had just the PlayStation was new.
01:29:55 They were like wow we can actually fit some like video on like these discs.
01:30:00 So they made some like anime cut scenes for the game that look pretty good.
01:30:05 And the Japanese voice acting is all right but the English the English dub is like remarkable remarkably like awkward.
01:30:17 Frickin I can't I can't do it just just look it up I guess just look up clips if you want to see some some good but that one of zero yelling while he's holding Iris is the.
01:30:28 It's basically the I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with light.
01:30:35 You know that one.
01:30:36 Oh yeah.
01:30:37 It's basically that it's just as good.
01:30:41 I'm watching a clip.
01:30:43 Is he going to say it.
01:30:44 You watch zero.
01:30:46 Can we play the clip.
01:30:47 Eleazar play the clip.
01:30:48 No this isn't happening.
01:30:50 There's no reason for me to go on.
01:30:52 What am I fighting for.
01:30:58 The second way is the way he kind of gets like all nasally at the end of his yell.
01:31:03 Yeah.
01:31:04 Yeah.
01:31:10 That's great.
01:31:11 There's a there's a there's two characters Iris and the Colonel they both have like I think they have New Zealand accents for some reason which like that's fine on its own but like the way that they talk like they sound so like calm.
01:31:26 I don't know.
01:31:27 There's a part where like the general is giving a big speech to all the troops and fricking Colonel comes up but he's like yes.
01:31:35 I concur.
01:31:36 I concur with the general sentiments.
01:31:38 We are the we will create an independent nation for all reploids.
01:31:43 We are the greatest military in the world.
01:31:46 We are the repliforce and everyone goes.
01:31:48 Yeah.
01:31:50 It's pretty it's pretty good.
01:31:56 It's pretty good.
01:31:57 All those people don't know what they're fighting for.
01:32:02 Man to be to be a to be a to be a member of a insurrectionist robot army trying to create a robot ethno state in space you know at least at least I would have at least I'd be passionate about something.
01:32:20 Anyway what was I was I talking about how do I get on the subject.
01:32:25 Zero zero yell.
01:32:28 I don't know whatever.
01:32:30 What are you fighting for nothing.
01:32:32 Nothing.
01:32:33 I'm fighting for.
01:32:38 Big old tits that's what I'm fighting for.
01:32:41 That's my that's the thing I like that's just that's just crass.
01:32:46 That's just despicable.
01:32:48 I'd rather be crass than grass.
01:32:52 What are you dead.
01:32:54 Oh yeah.
01:32:55 When we die our bodies become the grass and the antelope eat the grass.
01:32:59 Yeah.
01:33:03 Hey you know someone you remember how the stream didn't work.
01:33:09 Yes.
01:33:11 Well I got a Wi-Fi extender.
01:33:13 I haven't set it up yet.
01:33:15 I don't know if it will improve things for like you know the like remaining like month or two that I'm here.
01:33:21 But it might so I'm going to set that up and see if that improves my my connection situation.
01:33:28 In the discord F Fka Ren suggested something called a power line adapter that I've never heard of before do you know what that is.
01:33:40 Parallel I don't know the things like what they're for for making Wi-Fi stronger but I think the one I have is like you plug a thing into you plug the the router into this thing and that plugs into the power of the house and then you
01:34:02 you plug you you plug a receiver into another wall thing and that is like it takes the signal from the thing from the power from the power outlet somehow.
01:34:16 That sounds that sounds insane.
01:34:19 It's that yeah I don't really know how it works it's different from a Wi-Fi extender I believe.
01:34:25 Yeah.
01:34:26 But it I plug I plug my my like LAN cable into that like power outlet thingy and I get really good internet.
01:34:34 Oh you have one.
01:34:36 Yeah.
01:34:37 Huh.
01:34:38 Because because my my room is far from the the router I can't get a good signal through the wall.
01:34:43 Well I don't I don't know if that would work because I don't know if that would work for me because yeah my router is up on the second floor in a guy's room.
01:34:54 And my like power is on a different switch like I I might have mentioned that I lost power like three times last month.
01:35:05 Oh shit I didn't know it was more than once.
01:35:07 Oh yeah it happened it happened two more times after that like I guess it's been like two weeks now but it happened like once a week for a while there.
01:35:16 Yeah I lost it multiple times it was really annoying.
01:35:20 But it hasn't happened in a little while so the problem might be fixed.
01:35:25 But anyway when I lost power I would only lose power in my room and in the adjacent room the kitchen didn't lose power and the upstairs didn't lose power.
01:35:34 So we're on different circuits so I feel like it would not work to plug the yeah probably yeah maybe maybe in the next house I could do that something like that.
01:35:44 Yeah I would look into it more that it's really confusing that there are different multiple different ways to extend a Wi-Fi signal that are very similarly named.
01:35:55 Yeah well this Wi-Fi this Wi-Fi adapter might do something I was only like 25 bucks so I was like I'll try it I'll see if I'll see if it has any positive impact.
01:36:09 Like I said I used to have a Wi-Fi adapter down here but the guy left and he took it and it hasn't been haven't had a problem without it but maybe the fact that it is missing now has been negatively affecting things and we'll see if I can fix them.
01:36:27 Damn I went to a birthday party yesterday.
01:36:34 Oh you know what I kind of want I wanted to mention I don't know we were saying things that I'm good at and I said I can sometimes be charming.
01:36:43 Well I didn't I didn't feel charming at this birthday party yesterday because I didn't know anybody.
01:36:49 I was there I have a friend he invited me to his thing I had met him and I'd met his wife before and I didn't know anyone else.
01:36:56 And I I don't know I didn't feel good I didn't feel good about it.
01:37:04 I some of the time I just kind of stood around I did talk to people here and there and mostly I just was I don't know it was mostly just neutral.
01:37:16 There's a lot of neutral shooting the shit feeling like feeling like why am I even why am I even bothering.
01:37:22 Why am I why am I talking.
01:37:24 I don't like I do these people even want to talk to me they don't know me.
01:37:29 Should I just shut up.
01:37:32 Was it like that image of the soy jacket the party and he's like they don't even know that I'm Ben Singh.
01:37:40 No God no I you know I really tried.
01:37:45 I actually really tried not to bring up like Internet stuff or or like it did it did end up coming up once or twice and I tried not to dwell on it.
01:37:59 But I did at one or two points explain a little bit talk a little bit about like doing a podcast or whatever and I felt terrible I felt shame.
01:38:12 I like tried to move past the subject as fast as I could.
01:38:16 Is it like what do you do sort of conversation.
01:38:20 Some someone was talking about I forget how someone was talking about a podcast that they listened to and they talked about like drama that had involved in it and like how it like the members had broken up or something.
01:38:36 And I and I and I felt like I could not not mention that like oh something kind of like that happened to me a little bit.
01:38:45 I sort of had a similar thing.
01:38:47 I wouldn't you would not.
01:38:50 I don't think I would know.
01:38:52 No.
01:38:53 I feel like the I because people know what drama is you could just talk about drama.
01:39:02 I wouldn't I wouldn't want to say oh yeah I had a bit of that I had a podcast and by the way I'm on the Internet and you can find me here.
01:39:08 I didn't do that.
01:39:09 I didn't I didn't do that.
01:39:11 There was that and there was another someone someone else was talking about something they had posted that had gone somewhat viral and someone else mentioned that I like do comics or something and this person asked me like oh where can I follow you what's your what's your.
01:39:27 I was like yeah this is my Twitter like yeah.
01:39:31 And then the and then they actually that person specifically asked me.
01:39:35 That person specifically asked me like can you tell me more about like.
01:39:41 You know your like your podcast or whatever about that thing you were saying about like how like you people you split up with the other like whatever they asked about it and I had to be like I'd rather actually not get into the details about it.
01:39:55 Like I kind of don't want to talk about it in its length here and now.
01:40:03 And so I didn't.
01:40:06 And I when I wish I wished I had not mentioned anything about it.
01:40:11 That sucks.
01:40:12 Yeah.
01:40:13 I mean at the end of the day this was not this was not like this was just one thing that got mentioned among many many things we mostly talked about birds.
01:40:22 And that was fine.
01:40:24 I don't know I just felt like.
01:40:26 Oh here I am out in the real world among real people.
01:40:29 Yeah I am a sap.
01:40:30 Yeah I have frittered away in my life on worthless worthless things.
01:40:37 But that's okay.
01:40:39 You know what.
01:40:40 Well it is.
01:40:42 Yeah.
01:40:43 Like like all right.
01:40:44 I don't I don't know if it is.
01:40:46 Well I mean I don't know if I think it's actually okay.
01:40:49 But like what would a non-wasted life look like.
01:40:53 I don't know something that something that left me in a position now where I feel like this is what I can contribute to the world.
01:41:01 This is this is how I can give value to other people and do something that matters and so that people appreciate.
01:41:09 I don't know what that would be just something instead.
01:41:13 Oh maybe I could maybe I oh if something is bad if there's a problem.
01:41:18 Oh well maybe I could podcast about it.
01:41:20 Maybe that would maybe that would help.
01:41:23 Oh maybe I could maybe I could draw a comic about it.
01:41:27 Well no because like I don't know what I would actually say with with with drawings about anything because I can't I can't think anymore.
01:41:42 But almost that's all that's almost a skill.
01:41:47 I think it's like if you if you didn't have a clear idea it's sort of unhelpful to just say I've wasted my life.
01:41:57 If you didn't like because like I don't know how's that going to help right now.
01:42:03 Well you know they say the first step of getting better is to admit you have a problem and continue admitting it over and over again.
01:42:11 Sure.
01:42:12 Well I mean it's easy to admit you have a like you're unhappy.
01:42:19 Right.
01:42:21 But I don't think wondering about like if only some nondescript thing had happened in my life I wouldn't be right here.
01:42:32 That would be great.
01:42:34 Like you get a time machine is like OK Ben you can solve your problems what are you going to do.
01:42:39 I don't know.
01:42:40 I'm going to go back to that time I missed the sports ball and I'm going to I'm going to I don't know coach my young self to do it right and then I'm going to become a sports guy.
01:42:54 I don't know if I if I if I'd stayed in if I'd stayed in school gotten my masters become a scientist or whatever I probably would be feeling like damn I work in a lab.
01:43:06 I work for some fucking stupid military contractor or something.
01:43:12 I do I do I make I make some some garbage for industrial equipment.
01:43:20 I've wasted my life.
01:43:22 This is all meaningless.
01:43:24 I wish I wish I'd done something.
01:43:26 I wish I'd done something creative.
01:43:28 I wish I'd been an indie comics artist instead.
01:43:30 Now that would be now that would be the life.
01:43:33 Yeah.
01:43:34 And then I could express myself or whatever is grim grim.
01:43:43 I don't know what else to say.
01:43:45 You can't keep being grim.
01:43:48 Can't keep getting away with it.
01:43:50 You can't keep shitting where you think because then you have a poofy brain.
01:43:58 I you're not wrong.
01:44:02 I'm out of topics.
01:44:04 I'm out of topics that I put on my stupid list of things I wanted to talk about today.
01:44:08 Yeah.
01:44:10 I didn't really have any topics aside from just mentioning Roe v. Wade.
01:44:15 Oh yeah.
01:44:17 We already talked about it.
01:44:19 Who cares about that when I feel bad?
01:44:21 What about I feel bad?
01:44:23 What about I feel bad?
01:44:25 I guess I'll say here the the commissions that I was doing.
01:44:31 I'm going to close those.
01:44:33 Yeah.
01:44:34 So they're already closed by the time you're listening to this.
01:44:38 Just because I've had trouble getting the rest of them finished.
01:44:42 And that sort of it's always with this with commissions where I'm like, oh shit, they've paid money.
01:44:48 Now I've got to deliver.
01:44:50 And I deliver it like pretty good.
01:44:52 Honestly, like some pretty good art.
01:44:54 And then I got stuck on one of them and the the the the the slowing momentum caused all the problems in the world to happen.
01:45:05 And so I made me depressed.
01:45:07 And so I'm trying to work on feeling better.
01:45:10 Yeah.
01:45:11 So I've got to do those.
01:45:13 And I don't know what I'm going to do after that.
01:45:17 But I'm singularly focused on just trying to actually feel better first.
01:45:25 So I've been watching Breaking Bad.
01:45:27 And I'm like, ah, remember when he said we got to cook?
01:45:30 I like that.
01:45:32 I like the characters.
01:45:33 I like the writing.
01:45:34 Good show.
01:45:35 Oh, good show, everybody.
01:45:37 Clap clap.
01:45:39 Yeah.
01:45:40 And then I've been fucking playing oblivion and slashing people with a sword and playing Team Fortress 2 and being like, what if what if I was in the past and this I was playing sniper and I shot him.
01:45:55 That would be good.
01:45:57 That's what I've really been occupying myself with is just trying not to be depressed, trying to do things that make me happier.
01:46:04 And then we're doing a podcast now.
01:46:09 I don't know what I'm going to do afterwards.
01:46:12 Oh, wait, wait.
01:46:13 I'm going to finish my footnotes for Slime and Punishment because they really are like very close.
01:46:17 They really are really close to being done.
01:46:19 And that is a bright spot in my dark life.
01:46:26 I do have a topic or a thing that I've been doing that's new.
01:46:30 When I got back from the whole being in America thing.
01:46:36 This whole America business, yep.
01:46:39 I got a calorie counting app and I'm like, okay, I'm actually going to do that for once because the last time I got a calorie counting app, it was for Americans and they had like American products in it and I'm like, I don't know what I'm looking at.
01:46:54 So I found a UK based one which had things I recognized and I'm like, okay, I can actually use this.
01:46:59 So I've been tracking my calories and it's been very helpful.
01:47:04 And I've always been very thin.
01:47:06 So I've actually been trying to gain a bit of weight.
01:47:09 And I've been being like, wow, I have a normal day where I eat what I expect is fine.
01:47:15 And I'm like, oh, you need to eat 700 calories at 11 p.m.
01:47:21 You're saying that you underate?
01:47:24 I underate.
01:47:26 If I left my own devices, I just normally don't eat enough for the goal weight that I want to achieve.
01:47:33 I'm like, shit, gotta binge right at the end.
01:47:36 That's always really weird.
01:47:38 I can't even believe this is a real problem that some people have.
01:47:45 Well, I get it.
01:47:47 Shut up.
01:47:48 In theory, I guess.
01:47:50 It's not a difficult problem.
01:47:52 I'm not trying to tell you that it's not a real thing.
01:47:56 But also, it's so bizarre to me.
01:47:58 It's not anorexia.
01:48:01 It's not a serious issue.
01:48:04 Some people are just, I don't know, peckish.
01:48:08 Peckish?
01:48:09 I feel hungry.
01:48:11 I'm not used to going out of my way to get something when I'm hungry.
01:48:16 And so I will be like, oh, it's only one hour till dinner.
01:48:20 And I forgot to have lunch, so I'll just have dinner instead.
01:48:25 And that's like, oh, I have a calorie deficit.
01:48:28 I have a fat deficit.
01:48:30 This is not good.
01:48:32 That's something that has helped me not overeat is just not having things that I can snack on.
01:48:41 Because if I can snack on stuff, then I will just continuously snack on stuff.
01:48:45 And I'll eat an infinite amount.
01:48:49 So now I don't have that.
01:48:51 The only option I have to eat is that I have to actually make something,
01:48:56 even if it's something simple like a wrap or a sandwich or something.
01:48:59 And just that little energy barrier that I have to cross to eat,
01:49:04 it keeps me on track.
01:49:11 But yeah, aside from a couple nights where I'm like, shit,
01:49:16 I got to chug some milk or something to get that fat content up,
01:49:21 which has been amusing.
01:49:25 Are you going to go mad?
01:49:28 I've looked at, somebody said that, and I'm like,
01:49:30 Do you know what that is?
01:49:31 A gallon of milk a day.
01:49:33 Not a gallon.
01:49:34 Not any closer gallon.
01:49:35 I used to do that.
01:49:36 I used to do that.
01:49:37 A gallon of milk is like an unbelievable amount of excess for me.
01:49:43 It's not a small amount.
01:49:45 If you're a bodybuilder and you're doing like strenuous exercise,
01:49:50 there's people who say it's like decent enough
01:49:55 because it's very easy to ingest a version of the amount of nutrients you need.
01:50:02 It is a good way to gain weight.
01:50:05 Yeah.
01:50:06 But I mean, a glass of milk a day.
01:50:09 I'm doing go mad.
01:50:10 It's different.
01:50:12 Like a little lowercase g.
01:50:14 Yeah.
01:50:15 Go mad.
01:50:16 Glass of milk a day.
01:50:17 Cute.
01:50:19 So that's sort of working.
01:50:22 And yeah, that's something in my life now where I'm eating something
01:50:27 and being like, okay, what was that made of?
01:50:29 That's one of these, one of those.
01:50:31 Okay.
01:50:32 That and I just, I'm logging it.
01:50:34 I'm logging my weight.
01:50:36 And now I just got to do exercises as well because I did one day of exercise.
01:50:42 And I was like, okay, that's, I did, I did it.
01:50:45 Now I just got to keep consistent with it.
01:50:47 And I didn't do it the second time and I forgot every time after that
01:50:50 because it was like, ah, but I fucked it up.
01:50:52 Ah, whatever.
01:50:54 I have, I have also, I have not been lifting the last couple of weeks.
01:51:00 Maybe two, maybe two, two or two and a half weeks, two or three weeks.
01:51:05 It's been, I was into it for a while and then I fell off and I should start again.
01:51:10 Do you mind, I mean, do you want to share your like fitness goals?
01:51:17 I'd be curious.
01:51:18 Like, do you have a goal weight in mind or like, is there some form of exercise
01:51:22 you'd like to like be able to do or something like that?
01:51:29 The goal weight is at the moment.
01:51:32 I just pulled a number.
01:51:34 I didn't really think too much, but I was at like 64.7 kilograms.
01:51:41 Oh God.
01:51:42 Oh, right.
01:51:43 Kilograms.
01:51:44 No.
01:51:45 Yeah.
01:51:46 Okay.
01:51:47 Okay.
01:51:48 No, I was 62.7 kilograms.
01:51:51 I wanted to get to 65 because that's more healthy for my height.
01:51:56 So I've been doing that exercise wise.
01:52:01 Mostly I've been looking into like butt shaping ones because that's that's epic squats
01:52:08 and leg lifts and lunges and things like that.
01:52:12 I guess I could do push-ups as well.
01:52:15 I don't really know.
01:52:16 I'm kind of an idiot and researching these things.
01:52:19 I look at all the numbers and the words and the journals and the articles and I get
01:52:24 overwhelmed and then I just ask people, what do you do?
01:52:27 And then they say, well, it will depend on what you want.
01:52:30 And I'm like, I don't know what I want.
01:52:32 So I'm just sort of guessing mostly.
01:52:36 I'm like, oh, what's a rep?
01:52:38 What's a set?
01:52:39 How many of them do you do and why do you do them?
01:52:43 Well, here's the thing.
01:52:48 I follow a very orthodox philosophy.
01:52:52 I believe that everybody should do a basic strength building routine.
01:53:01 Squat deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows.
01:53:08 And I think anyone that says no, no, no, that's two.
01:53:14 I think that's like the baseline.
01:53:19 I feel like that's the baseline that everybody should be working off of.
01:53:23 You do that and then when you can't improve that anymore, you branch off into some other things.
01:53:28 And some people try to say, oh, no, I have some fancy alternative.
01:53:32 But no, you can't beat the basic.
01:53:37 That's just the most basic.
01:53:40 I'm doing star jumps exclusively.
01:53:42 Works all the muscle groups.
01:53:45 So that's my if not to work all the muscle groups.
01:53:50 You just tense all your muscles at once.
01:53:53 You just sit there.
01:53:56 Your whole body.
01:53:59 All intention.
01:54:04 Well, one way, first you contract every muscle in your body as hard as you can.
01:54:09 And then you extend every muscle in your body as hard.
01:54:12 That's our early joint.
01:54:13 Implode, explode.
01:54:14 That's the system I'm going for.
01:54:16 Yeah.
01:54:18 But anyway, I'm not qualified to give any advice because I haven't lifted in a few weeks and I'm a hypocrite.
01:54:24 So, you know, disqualified.
01:54:27 But if I were qualified to give advice, I would say to do starting strength, Mark Ripto.
01:54:35 Ripto, like from Spyro?
01:54:37 That's the guy's name.
01:54:38 Yeah, Mark Ripto.
01:54:42 R-I-P-P-T-O-E?
01:54:44 He wrote the book.
01:54:46 He wrote the starting strength book.
01:54:49 Maybe we'll look into that, but I probably will forget.
01:54:55 I think a basic strength building routine with the basic movements, squat, deadlift, bench, et cetera, et cetera.
01:55:08 That's how you get all the muscles in your body.
01:55:13 That's how you get them strong in the least work.
01:55:18 That's the most efficient way to just get all your muscles strong.
01:55:23 And then from that, you might branch off and do, okay, well, in addition to that, I also want to increase hypertrophy in certain parts of my body.
01:55:34 And then you might add onto that baseline.
01:55:36 Okay, and then I'll also do, I don't know, three sets of 12 bicep curls, three sets of 12 triceps extension to get big arms or whatever.
01:55:49 Yeah.
01:55:50 Yeah.
01:55:51 That's the slash fit way.
01:55:55 I don't really have the space to do a big bar deadlift.
01:56:00 But I do have smaller weights of some of them are quite big.
01:56:06 Does it work doing bench press but with two hand weights?
01:56:12 It's not the same, but it probably could work similarly.
01:56:20 I mean, yeah, you can do a dumbbell press.
01:56:25 You can do dumbbell press, dumbbell squats, dumbbell press.
01:56:29 I guess you could do a dumbbell deadlift.
01:56:32 I've never heard of anyone doing that, but you could do something similar.
01:56:36 They would have to be pretty hefty.
01:56:39 I guess you could just get a stick and glue them together.
01:56:42 The important thing is that it's some free weights, that you're doing it with free weights and that you're using your body's natural leverage.
01:56:58 I couldn't advise you how to do those ones because I'm sure the form would be completely different if you were holding.
01:57:05 I've never done it like that.
01:57:07 Honestly, the last time I moved, finding a place with a basement was a big priority because I wanted to set up my weight rack.
01:57:18 And now Anna is putting it in Munchie's house in his basement.
01:57:23 Fortunately, he had a basement with room for it.
01:57:27 When I was over there, I tried it.
01:57:29 Yeah, you mentioned.
01:57:31 I don't know whether I mentioned on the podcast, but I tried to do a curl with the weights.
01:57:39 Just the bar itself was like 45 pounds.
01:57:42 I couldn't even do one curl.
01:57:44 Yeah, I mean, that's a pretty big.
01:57:49 That bar is pretty big.
01:57:51 Yeah, that's my case.
01:57:53 It's not made for curling.
01:57:56 I could do a few, I think.
01:58:03 There's a specific bar called a curl bar that has a bend in it that gives you a more comfortable grip than the flat straight bar.
01:58:15 Yeah, it's been a couple weeks.
01:58:21 I'm sure I've lost some of my gains.
01:58:23 It hasn't been like months.
01:58:25 Like the last time I stopped lifting, I didn't lift for months after I got COVID.
01:58:31 I should get back over there.
01:58:34 I should get back into it.
01:58:35 I just have been telling myself, oh God, it's proving everything you said right.
01:58:43 I've been telling myself, I should be working.
01:58:46 I should be finishing something.
01:58:48 So no time to do something that might make me happier, like working out or whatever.
01:58:57 No time to think about that.
01:59:00 Your mind's locked in.
01:59:02 It's not relaxed.
01:59:04 It's not relaxing on thinking about anything else.
01:59:08 And now it's been long enough that I'm thinking like, oh, well, I can't tell Munchie that I want to work out again.
01:59:16 It's been long enough that if he wanted to do that, he would have asked me already.
01:59:20 So he must not want me to.
01:59:22 He must just want me to leave alone.
01:59:24 No, no way.
01:59:26 Yeah, there's no way.
01:59:28 Nobody wants to hear from me.
01:59:30 Just message an idiot.
01:59:32 No, no, no.
01:59:34 He would have talked to me if he still liked me.
01:59:38 Everyone hates me.
01:59:40 Everyone's secretly plotting behind my back.
01:59:42 I mean, that is true.
01:59:44 I know.
01:59:46 I know.
01:59:48 I was trying to assassinate you.
01:59:50 That's why I came over, but I couldn't find the right moment.
01:59:52 No, no.
01:59:54 You were going to do it.
01:59:56 I wanted to be the PCP's only host, only person.
02:00:00 You wanted to be the procrastinator.
02:00:02 I did.
02:00:04 There could be only one.
02:00:06 I got to get Nate.
02:00:08 I got to get Nate to finish.
02:00:10 I transferred over most of the account.
02:00:12 The last thing that needs to be transferred
02:00:14 to me is the AdSense account.
02:00:16 It needs to be switched
02:00:18 from his Google
02:00:20 to my Google.
02:00:22 I don't exactly know how to do that,
02:00:24 but apparently there is a way to do it.
02:00:26 That's the last thing
02:00:28 that needs to be moved.
02:00:30 Everything else, the Patreon
02:00:32 has been switched so that it pays out to me now
02:00:34 and everything like that.
02:00:36 I'm mostly set up to be
02:00:38 handling payments going forward.
02:00:40 I think Nate owes us
02:00:42 several months.
02:00:44 When was the last time we got paid?
02:00:46 It's been a while, honestly.
02:00:48 It has been a while, yeah.
02:00:54 We missed the money from April.
02:00:56 Lamal.
02:00:58 Other than that.
02:01:02 I'm not even stressed about it.
02:01:04 This is what I mean when it's like,
02:01:06 I don't
02:01:08 I don't need money.
02:01:10 I do need money,
02:01:12 but I'm also at a
02:01:14 position where I don't feel
02:01:16 pressured to earn money
02:01:18 in a way that's like, oh, I gotta find a job
02:01:20 that makes more money. It's like, no,
02:01:22 I don't really need to do that.
02:01:24 So I can think about
02:01:26 hmm, well, if I had
02:01:28 you know,
02:01:30 this is gonna sound like such a
02:01:32 I hate this phrase,
02:01:34 but such a first-world problem.
02:01:36 That's like,
02:01:38 they ask like, if you had all the money
02:01:40 in the world, you know, what would you do?
02:01:42 If you didn't need to make money, what would you do?
02:01:44 I kind of feel, even though I don't
02:01:46 I don't make that much, but I make
02:01:48 enough to live on and now I'm like, well,
02:01:50 it kind of feels like I do have all the money in the world.
02:01:52 I feel like I have everything I ever need
02:01:54 and now, like,
02:01:56 and now what?
02:01:58 I've reached the top of the mountain.
02:02:00 I say this as someone who like
02:02:02 barely exceeds like
02:02:04 the poverty line
02:02:06 and yet, and yet what more?
02:02:08 What more is there?
02:02:10 I mean, I guess I could like buy a house or something,
02:02:12 but that feels like so far away
02:02:14 that it doesn't even feel like it's worth
02:02:16 thinking about.
02:02:18 You know?
02:02:20 That's like a whole other level
02:02:22 that I'm like,
02:02:24 why even bother?
02:02:26 My
02:02:29 anyway.
02:02:31 Anyway, that's so
02:02:33 darn.
02:02:34 If only
02:02:36 wish I was poor. I wish I was poorer
02:02:38 so that I have more problems so that I'd feel more
02:02:40 motivated to like do something about it.
02:02:42 I wish, Dan, that would really compel me to get
02:02:44 on the hustle and grind set, you know?
02:02:46 And then I'd be making moves.
02:02:50 Until you started to have any
02:02:52 success at all and then you would stop.
02:02:54 That's right.
02:02:56 But I'd be so relieved to be like,
02:02:58 now I can have an existential
02:03:00 crisis again.
02:03:02 I've been waiting for this.
02:03:04 Ugh.
02:03:06 See, the transition from feeling
02:03:08 motivated into feeling depressed is
02:03:10 that's the goldmine there.
02:03:12 I love that moment in my life.
02:03:14 Every time it happens, it's just so great.
02:03:16 You know how there are people
02:03:18 I think there are some people
02:03:20 who are like
02:03:22 they're addicted to like
02:03:24 the start
02:03:26 of a relationship.
02:03:28 Like they really like to like get into
02:03:30 relationships because it's like
02:03:32 exciting and it feels good.
02:03:34 But like they're not
02:03:36 but they just do it for the
02:03:38 initial rush.
02:03:40 Yeah, there is an initial rush, like
02:03:42 chemically in the brain.
02:03:44 The whole like love
02:03:46 honeymoon phase, whatever.
02:03:48 Right. Well, for me
02:03:50 for me it's
02:03:52 that feeling of
02:03:54 ugh.
02:03:56 There's nothing left
02:03:58 to work for.
02:04:00 I've peaked. It's all over.
02:04:02 It's all downhill for me.
02:04:04 I love to hit that peak
02:04:06 and get that rush of it's all downhill.
02:04:08 I'm addicted to it.
02:04:12 I would say
02:04:14 message Munchie
02:04:16 and say, want to work out
02:04:18 or I want to work out, please let me work out.
02:04:20 Yeah.
02:04:22 And do some of that exercise.
02:04:24 That's clearly something you like doing
02:04:26 and it makes you feel good.
02:04:28 It does make me feel
02:04:30 a lot better.
02:04:32 When I'm lifting, I feel better about myself
02:04:34 regardless of my other
02:04:36 circumstances.
02:04:38 But do I deserve to feel better about myself?
02:04:40 Maybe I should
02:04:42 deliberately withhold that
02:04:44 to punish myself.
02:04:46 And maybe that'll really get me back
02:04:48 on track. The feeling of
02:04:50 like, oh, well, I'm not allowed to feel good
02:04:52 until I accomplish something
02:04:54 that fixes all my problems.
02:04:58 Think about it.
02:05:00 I know that your therapist says something different
02:05:02 but have you considered that I might know better?
02:05:04 That I might have a better idea?
02:05:06 No, I've never thought of that.
02:05:08 Because it's so stupid.
02:05:10 Why do we have to listen to the expert?
02:05:12 America is sick and tired of experts.
02:05:14 We're tired of scientists.
02:05:16 Let's talk to a scientist.
02:05:18 Y'all motherfuckers lying and getting me pissed.
02:05:20 All right?
02:05:22 Aren't you a scientist, Ben?
02:05:24 No!
02:05:26 I should have been.
02:05:28 I should have been miserable as a scientist.
02:05:30 I should have been the kind of guy I would listen to.
02:05:32 Instead of miserable as an artist.
02:05:36 Yeah.
02:05:38 I don't know.
02:05:40 I guess if I'd become
02:05:42 like a
02:05:44 material scientist or like
02:05:46 some kind of researcher.
02:05:48 Maybe I'd have a specialization.
02:05:50 Maybe I'd have a specialty. Maybe I'd have some expertise.
02:05:52 I saw someone
02:05:54 on Twitter
02:05:56 say like,
02:05:58 I don't know.
02:06:00 They were just talking about like
02:06:02 a big platform or whatever.
02:06:04 Cloud is not important.
02:06:06 It's better to have expertise.
02:06:08 Better to be an expert in something
02:06:10 so that you have a stable income
02:06:12 and then you can just shitpost
02:06:14 online.
02:06:16 And like,
02:06:18 I get that.
02:06:20 And it's not so much that like, oh my god.
02:06:22 They're right. I want to shitpost.
02:06:24 They just made me reflect on, oh my god.
02:06:26 I have no expertise.
02:06:28 I,
02:06:30 what am I, what's the point?
02:06:32 What can I, what do I have?
02:06:34 I guess I just
02:06:36 wish, I just want to
02:06:38 feel like what do I have that I can
02:06:40 what can I do?
02:06:42 What can I do
02:06:44 for other people? Right?
02:06:46 Cause that's, that's what's important.
02:06:48 You're right. It is, it is like doing something
02:06:50 for other people is like a good way
02:06:52 to feel
02:06:54 passionate about it.
02:06:56 And you know, when I think about
02:06:58 people that I really admire,
02:07:00 like I really admire,
02:07:02 I really admire Dan Olson
02:07:04 like the, the NFT video.
02:07:06 It's not just that it was a good video.
02:07:08 It's, that's not what makes it good.
02:07:10 It's that it like,
02:07:12 it gave people something.
02:07:14 It gave people the tools to understand
02:07:16 something that they didn't understand
02:07:18 before. It, he gave
02:07:20 something to people with that video.
02:07:22 It's like, I want to give something
02:07:24 to people
02:07:26 so that they'll like me.
02:07:32 What if you give them
02:07:34 the knowledge that
02:07:36 Ben St. is ripped?
02:07:38 Maybe, maybe that's
02:07:40 the thing to strive for.
02:07:44 I can't guess there are worse things.
02:07:50 Man, oh man.
02:07:52 I mean, I don't feel like
02:07:54 expertise is something I have.
02:07:56 I, I like pick up
02:07:58 bits here and there and I'm like,
02:08:00 yeah, but I'm not a master of my craft.
02:08:02 Any of, any of the crafts I know
02:08:04 of, I don't really like
02:08:06 excel at them.
02:08:08 That sometimes annoys me
02:08:10 that I, I, I, I don't
02:08:12 have a personality that is
02:08:14 better at focusing on
02:08:16 a single thing and going
02:08:18 just for that. Every time I
02:08:20 see something cool, I'm like, oh, I want to do
02:08:22 that. And then I
02:08:24 stop whatever I'm doing and try
02:08:26 to learn a new skill and then get distracted
02:08:28 again. I just have all these
02:08:30 like half skills
02:08:32 and it's a
02:08:34 yeah.
02:08:36 It's, it's a little, a little
02:08:38 upsetting, but I don't.
02:08:40 I feel like I'm a dabbler. I've dabbled
02:08:42 in many things.
02:08:44 I'm not, I'm not really a master
02:08:46 of anything. I guess I'm
02:08:48 I guess I'm okay at drawing.
02:08:50 I guess, I guess
02:08:52 if I had to pick one skill that I'm the
02:08:54 best at, it might be drawing,
02:08:56 but like I don't feel like I'm,
02:08:58 I don't, I wouldn't call myself
02:09:00 a great artist or anything.
02:09:02 I wouldn't call myself an expert draftsman.
02:09:04 Yeah.
02:09:06 But I think that what I've
02:09:08 tried, struggled with
02:09:10 and tried to get better at is just accepting
02:09:12 that I don't need to be
02:09:14 like the master of
02:09:16 anything. I can just be
02:09:18 a dabbler
02:09:20 and that's fine.
02:09:22 It's, it's fine.
02:09:24 It's
02:09:26 there's always a preferable thing
02:09:28 that you could be. It's, it's fine.
02:09:30 You don't need to beat yourself up
02:09:32 about not being that like
02:09:34 hypothetical perfect person.
02:09:36 It's fine to dabble. I just
02:09:38 wish that there was some, I wish, wish
02:09:40 that I could find some
02:09:42 thing that would
02:09:44 be a task
02:09:46 that would like
02:09:48 require like a good assortment
02:09:50 of the, you know, I've
02:09:52 heard people say the
02:09:54 skill stack, right? Like your, like your skill
02:09:56 stack.
02:09:58 As in like the things
02:10:00 that you can do are
02:10:02 is your skill stack. Your Pokemon types.
02:10:04 The stamp damage.
02:10:06 And it's like, and it's like, I don't know,
02:10:08 like it would be really great to
02:10:10 find something to apply myself to
02:10:12 that combined,
02:10:14 you know, the things that I have dabbled
02:10:16 in
02:10:18 in some, in some meaning that
02:10:20 combines them meaningfully.
02:10:22 And
02:10:24 I don't know.
02:10:26 Drawing.
02:10:28 Presenting.
02:10:30 Programming.
02:10:32 Yeah.
02:10:34 Yeah, somewhat.
02:10:36 You have a voice?
02:10:38 I, I guess.
02:10:40 Did I, you know,
02:10:42 You have more voice than me for sure.
02:10:44 I did do that voice acting audition.
02:10:46 I'd like to, I'd like
02:10:48 the voice act. That would be fun.
02:10:50 I don't know, I don't know what
02:10:52 the name for this is.
02:10:54 Is there a name for
02:10:56 the thing of like
02:11:00 stuff, stuff like
02:11:02 getting the road to Radcon book,
02:11:04 The Pleeve and the Weave Blu-ray, stuff like,
02:11:06 or getting my, or getting my Kickstarter books
02:11:08 like made and shipped, like
02:11:10 fulfillment?
02:11:12 Is that a skill?
02:11:14 That's, it's management, it's organization,
02:11:16 it's a
02:11:18 I feel like I've done that sort of thing
02:11:20 enough. Like, like, get a thing,
02:11:22 get a thing made and ship it to people.
02:11:24 Yeah.
02:11:26 I feel like that's a skill that I have.
02:11:28 Because I've done it many times now.
02:11:30 Yeah. I mean, that is overwhelming
02:11:32 for some people, like me.
02:11:34 I get, I get a little fucked up
02:11:36 looking at, like,
02:11:38 I mean, I, don't, don't,
02:11:40 don't get me wrong. I also,
02:11:42 it fucked me up a little bit too.
02:11:44 But I've, but I've pushed,
02:11:46 I've pushed through it a few times now.
02:11:48 Yeah.
02:11:50 It's although, organization and,
02:11:52 and managing
02:11:54 multiple different things, managing
02:11:56 people.
02:11:58 It's all, it's all,
02:12:00 it's hard to say what the skill is,
02:12:02 but yeah.
02:12:04 Yeah. Those are important things. I don't know
02:12:06 what the name for it would be.
02:12:08 I guess,
02:12:10 I guess I could just say,
02:12:12 I don't know, I'm thinking about, like, if I put it
02:12:14 on a resume, I guess I could just say, like,
02:12:16 yeah, I've, I've
02:12:18 delivered on,
02:12:20 like, four different kickstarters
02:12:22 or something. I've done, like,
02:12:24 I, yeah, I don't know.
02:12:26 I got here.
02:12:30 So I don't, but anyway, I don't know what,
02:12:32 what a, what a,
02:12:34 what it looks like to take something
02:12:36 like that and turn that
02:12:38 into a, here's what I'm going to do with
02:12:40 my life.
02:12:42 You know?
02:12:44 It feels like an ancillary skill,
02:12:46 like, that's not something to do, that's
02:12:48 just something you can do in the course
02:12:50 of doing something
02:12:52 else. That's a skill that might help you
02:12:54 accomplish something else.
02:12:56 I feel like it's
02:12:58 far more likely you would
02:13:00 come across situations that
02:13:02 would require, like, two
02:13:04 combined skills, rather
02:13:06 than everything you know.
02:13:08 Yeah. Like two skills
02:13:10 are needed for this, three
02:13:12 skills are needed for that project.
02:13:14 Yeah. I don't know
02:13:16 if you'd find something that, like,
02:13:18 validates everything you've
02:13:20 dabbled in.
02:13:22 No. Maybe during
02:13:24 parts of the process that, like,
02:13:26 I don't know, you're
02:13:28 doing something
02:13:30 that isn't explicitly about
02:13:32 programming, but having programming knowledge
02:13:34 helps you think about something in some
02:13:36 way that, you know,
02:13:38 hard to get into specifics when you're just talking
02:13:40 hypothetical, but, like,
02:13:44 everything you do
02:13:46 has some minor
02:13:48 impact, I would think.
02:13:50 Yeah. I agree.
02:13:54 Nothing is, like, nothing
02:13:56 is wasted. Nothing's completely wasted,
02:13:58 like, oh, you'll never use that
02:14:00 in any capacity ever again.
02:14:04 So, like, I feel like I'm not
02:14:06 equipped to
02:14:08 make
02:14:10 Berserk 2
02:14:12 with the level of art and
02:14:14 writing ability that I have, but...
02:14:16 And don't you just feel terrible
02:14:18 about that.
02:14:20 Yeah. But, like, I
02:14:22 have
02:14:24 different skills
02:14:26 and they combine in different ways
02:14:28 and I can make Bell Jeep too.
02:14:30 I can do different
02:14:32 things. I don't know.
02:14:34 I know what it feels like
02:14:36 to see the best thing in the world
02:14:38 see one piece and think, well,
02:14:40 if I can't make a manga as good
02:14:42 and as long and as successful as one piece
02:14:44 then why am I doing any drawing?
02:14:46 It's easy to say that,
02:14:48 but, like,
02:14:50 don't worry about it.
02:14:52 Right. You don't need to.
02:14:54 But I like that, though.
02:14:56 You can't make one piece, but you can make
02:14:58 Bell Jeep. You can make.
02:15:00 And you're the only one that could do that.
02:15:02 Yeah.
02:15:04 That's what I told myself.
02:15:06 That's what I told myself about slime and punishment.
02:15:08 I said I have to do it.
02:15:10 Because nobody's...
02:15:12 This is not quite like anything
02:15:14 anyone has ever done and nobody
02:15:16 else could make exactly this.
02:15:18 This could never happen again.
02:15:20 It has to be me.
02:15:22 So I have to do it.
02:15:24 Uh...
02:15:26 And I guess it's true.
02:15:30 I guess it's true.
02:15:33 But also, who cares?
02:15:35 And what's the point?
02:15:37 No!
02:15:40 You'll get it.
02:15:42 I think you'll get it at some point.
02:15:44 You'll feel better about, like, motivating things.
02:15:47 Perhaps.
02:15:49 I think I will feel...
02:15:51 I will be glad.
02:15:54 I will be glad when the notes are done
02:15:56 and when I can finally be like,
02:15:58 okay, put the book together.
02:16:01 It's printing.
02:16:03 Set up the Kickstarter.
02:16:05 Just get it done.
02:16:07 I hope...
02:16:09 I hope that when it all is said and done,
02:16:11 I will feel good about
02:16:13 the whole slime and punishment project.
02:16:16 Uh...
02:16:18 And everything.
02:16:20 It's too early for me to
02:16:22 say, like,
02:16:24 well, Ben, you just wasted two years of your life.
02:16:26 And this is all you have to show for it.
02:16:28 Um...
02:16:30 As long as the Kickstarter is
02:16:32 even somewhat successful,
02:16:34 I'll be like, well, you know...
02:16:36 Well, you know...
02:16:38 At any point, I could go and say,
02:16:40 oh, there was a time in my life
02:16:42 where I wasn't drawing comics
02:16:44 and I could have been drawing it
02:16:46 from a much earlier age and I would be better at it.
02:16:48 So, you know, you should feel bad all the time, Gib.
02:16:50 You should feel really bad about that fact.
02:16:52 Yeah.
02:16:54 Like, I just don't... It doesn't matter.
02:16:56 Yeah, you're right.
02:16:58 It's...
02:17:00 Hey, you're right. Hey, it doesn't matter.
02:17:02 Hey, nothing matters.
02:17:04 Yeah.
02:17:06 Ah...
02:17:08 Ugh.
02:17:10 All right.
02:17:12 I don't know. Do you want to...
02:17:14 What about voicemails?
02:17:16 Yeah, let's voice.
02:17:18 Okay, then let's voice.
02:17:20 Let me pull it up here.
02:17:22 Oh, I'm seeing a lot of
02:17:24 stupid-looking voicemails.
02:17:26 I'm seeing a lot of skips.
02:17:28 I'm seeing a lot of skips on this...
02:17:30 Yeah, where did we start?
02:17:32 Oh, wait.
02:17:34 I didn't see the ones from last time.
02:17:36 Yeah.
02:17:38 Yeah, it's on the second page.
02:17:40 I think the first one
02:17:42 this week is called
02:17:44 Question.
02:17:46 Okay, three, two, one, go.
02:17:48 Did you guys watch
02:17:50 Monkey's Sex Take when it came out?
02:17:52 No.
02:17:54 I didn't watch it, no.
02:17:56 Although I did see some screenshots.
02:17:58 I think...
02:18:00 I didn't go to look for it,
02:18:02 but I did see in Discord
02:18:04 either a gif of like five...
02:18:06 Not five seconds, like one second
02:18:08 of something, and I'm like, oh, god.
02:18:10 And then a screenshot of his face.
02:18:12 I'm like, oh, why is this happening?
02:18:14 Oh, god.
02:18:16 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:18:18 Good times.
02:18:20 No, I didn't watch it.
02:18:22 I...
02:18:24 Why would I want to do that?
02:18:26 Um...
02:18:28 Okay, next one is...
02:18:30 Next one is where is Tom,
02:18:32 but not where, like,
02:18:34 location. Where is in, like,
02:18:36 a werewolf?
02:18:38 Yeah, okay, three, two, one, go.
02:18:40 Okay, there's no audio.
02:18:42 I feel like... Didn't we explain this already?
02:18:44 Didn't I already say...
02:18:46 Tom said he doesn't want to...
02:18:48 be around for the show, because...
02:18:50 He's busy with other things,
02:18:52 so he's not going to be around.
02:18:54 That's it?
02:18:56 I'm making a...
02:18:58 I'm making a hand gesture.
02:19:00 I'm making a... Oh, I can see it.
02:19:02 I'm making a repetitive hand gesture,
02:19:04 which is nature I won't specify,
02:19:06 but I'll let you...
02:19:08 I'll let you all...
02:19:10 He's blown kisses.
02:19:12 I won't say one way or the other.
02:19:14 Next one is called
02:19:16 My Secret Message Part 1.
02:19:18 Three, two, one, go.
02:19:38 He's breathing into it.
02:19:40 Breathing softly into the microphone.
02:19:42 There's no message.
02:19:44 I can't tell if maybe
02:19:46 he is just breathing
02:19:48 and there is no message.
02:19:50 He is saying something, but it's just not...
02:19:52 It's really quiet and not picking up
02:19:54 and it's completely unintelligible.
02:19:56 It's unintelligible if there is anything there.
02:19:58 Alright, next...
02:20:00 Don't do that.
02:20:02 Next one is Part 2.
02:20:04 Three, two, one, go.
02:20:08 God! Alright.
02:20:10 Thanks for the message.
02:20:12 Thanks for the message, buddy.
02:20:14 Good try.
02:20:16 Next one is called
02:20:18 Punished Air
02:20:20 Sensored Mad
02:20:22 Three, two, one, go.
02:20:42 Did I mention
02:20:44 that I legitimately
02:20:46 saw YouTube
02:20:48 delete
02:20:50 a comment from
02:20:52 the PCP account
02:20:54 on a PCP video?
02:20:56 Huh?
02:20:58 Like we've commented?
02:21:00 Yeah, like I replied
02:21:02 to a comment
02:21:04 on a PCP video
02:21:06 and I was like,
02:21:08 what?
02:21:10 I replied to a comment
02:21:12 on this account
02:21:14 and YouTube like deleted it
02:21:16 or like hit it.
02:21:18 What was the... Do you remember what you said?
02:21:20 Yeah.
02:21:22 I think I like called someone an idiot or something.
02:21:24 Like, it was
02:21:26 something like that.
02:21:28 Hang on, I'm going to
02:21:30 comments
02:21:32 to see like
02:21:34 held for review.
02:21:36 There's no comment from air
02:21:38 that's held for review.
02:21:40 So...
02:21:42 They disappeared it.
02:21:44 I'm looking...
02:21:46 YouTube be disappearing comments
02:21:48 that say idiot and fuck.
02:21:50 Ahhhh!
02:21:52 No, we've got to do, we've got to bring back
02:21:54 the YouTube replies.
02:21:56 Remember those?
02:21:58 Video responses, but like
02:22:00 baked into the system.
02:22:02 I never really
02:22:04 engaged with them or even really like
02:22:06 back when they were a thing.
02:22:08 But I hear people talk about them
02:22:10 being gone now
02:22:12 and how it made a difference.
02:22:14 I think the reason they left is because
02:22:18 girls with big boobies
02:22:20 would have their boobies in a thumbnail
02:22:22 or even not people.
02:22:24 They would just reply girls
02:22:26 and reply bait to get views
02:22:28 easily and it's like
02:22:30 if you could put boobs into a comment
02:22:32 you would get more likes
02:22:34 I guess is the parallel.
02:22:38 If only...
02:22:42 Yeah, I don't...
02:22:46 It's not in our mentions, I can't
02:22:48 approve it so like it's out of our hands
02:22:50 like it seems like YouTube is just
02:22:52 decides sometimes that a comment will simply be
02:22:54 gone into the ether and even
02:22:56 we don't have any ability to restore it
02:22:58 and I don't know
02:23:00 what the fuck is wrong with them.
02:23:02 Well at least
02:23:04 you can always send a voicemail
02:23:06 with your sentiments.
02:23:08 They can't censor you as far as I know
02:23:10 on Speakpipe.
02:23:12 The next one is
02:23:14 Happy Birthday Ben You Asshole
02:23:18 3, 2, 1, go.
02:23:20 I think that's a kiss
02:23:22 is that like a kiss sound?
02:23:26 Yeah, I guess so.
02:23:28 It's like a smooch
02:23:32 based?
02:23:34 Based? Happy Birthday?
02:23:36 So
02:23:38 next one is
02:23:40 YouTube links and I just, I'm not gonna
02:23:42 I'm not gonna engage with this
02:23:44 and then Happy Birthday
02:23:46 There's four Happy Birthdays in a row.
02:23:48 Happy Birthday Ben
02:23:50 Happy Birthday Ben
02:23:52 Happy Birthday Ben
02:23:54 and then there is another
02:23:56 YouTube link which I will not
02:23:58 which I will not be
02:24:00 not be
02:24:02 engaging with
02:24:04 in any way, shape, or form.
02:24:06 Thank you very much. Then there's simply
02:24:08 a link to youtube.com
02:24:10 and then there's just the word
02:24:12 please.
02:24:14 No.
02:24:16 No. You say please
02:24:18 I say no.
02:24:20 The next one is Happy Father's Day
02:24:22 Ben
02:24:24 Thanks
02:24:26 and then there's one from
02:24:28 MillerPrince930 and this one seems
02:24:30 to be real.
02:24:32 So three, two, one, go.
02:24:34 Please
02:24:36 please say that something
02:24:38 is
02:24:40 something or someone is a popcorn nihilist
02:24:42 is probably my favorite
02:24:44 meme.
02:24:46 Favorite Olden
02:24:48 semi-current meme.
02:24:50 I remember the popcorn nihilist but I can't
02:24:52 remember what it was about.
02:24:54 Did Munchy make that
02:24:56 up or did he get it from somewhere?
02:24:58 I mean, I don't know.
02:25:00 I feel like it's simple
02:25:02 enough to come up with. Somebody
02:25:04 who's a nihilist and they get the popcorn
02:25:06 and they watch things happen.
02:25:08 Yeah, I feel
02:25:10 like I get it and yet
02:25:12 ah, man
02:25:14 maybe I don't
02:25:16 remember if it came from somewhere. I feel like
02:25:18 if you google it
02:25:20 there is a, I found a
02:25:22 like on Urban Dictionary there's a quote
02:25:24 that's like Charlie Brown as a popcorn nihilist.
02:25:26 Is that from a PCP bonus episode
02:25:28 though?
02:25:30 I feel like that might have come
02:25:32 from us. Maybe.
02:25:34 That's funny. It's not
02:25:36 like a popular phrase. And then, I don't know
02:25:38 this guy probably remembers, but you remember
02:25:40 that I called, I called
02:25:42 Mr. Medicare a popcorn nihilist
02:25:44 and he
02:25:46 didn't understand the expression
02:25:48 and he thought it was funny so he put it in his
02:25:50 twitter bio for a bit there.
02:25:52 But he called it like
02:25:54 he didn't understand
02:25:56 that I was calling him a popcorn nihilist
02:25:58 he just thought I was calling him like
02:26:00 popcorn, like an adjective
02:26:02 so he said, he put something
02:26:04 in his bio that was like the popcorn party
02:26:06 pavilion
02:26:08 and like I get, he didn't
02:26:10 he sort of misunderstood the intent
02:26:12 but
02:26:14 for a while my insult
02:26:16 was in Medicare's twitter bio and then I think
02:26:18 he deleted all his accounts and I think he's
02:26:20 like dying of cancer or something
02:26:22 rip
02:26:24 next
02:26:26 next
02:26:28 do you have anything else to say about that?
02:26:30 No, I was just thinking about
02:26:32 sewer priest and if that was
02:26:34 an original, like a munchy original
02:26:36 wait
02:26:38 munchy original?
02:26:40 I thought that was a Jesse thing
02:26:42 I thought it was like a thing that munchy
02:26:44 said that Jesse really liked
02:26:46 maybe Jesse came up with sewer priest
02:26:48 I guess it would fit
02:26:50 with like the
02:26:52 the
02:26:54 sewage video
02:26:56 Man Sheld Marsh
02:26:58 Well now I don't know
02:27:00 I feel like
02:27:02 there were a lot of time
02:27:04 I remember sewer priest and like Christ Consciousness
02:27:06 like
02:27:08 Christ Consciousness is a munchy isn't
02:27:10 but he got it from
02:27:12 that video
02:27:14 but like I feel like sewer priest
02:27:16 would not have come from there
02:27:18 No, I mean
02:27:20 it just seems like a funny thing
02:27:22 to be
02:27:24 I know there were a lot of times
02:27:26 that like Jesse said something
02:27:28 that I thought was really funny
02:27:30 and then only like a long time
02:27:32 later would I discover that like he was quoting
02:27:34 something that I had not realized he was quoting
02:27:36 at the time
02:27:38 so I don't know
02:27:40 I don't remember
02:27:42 munchy ever saying it but maybe he did
02:27:44 I am more associate
02:27:46 that phrase with Jesse but I could be
02:27:48 misremembering
02:27:50 Okay, next one is called
02:27:52 Le Peeps Units Will Never Be
02:27:54 Defeats
02:27:56 3, 2, 1, go
02:27:58 So I was at the protest in Austin
02:28:00 about the Supreme Court stuff
02:28:02 and at some point during that time
02:28:04 we started doing the People United
02:28:06 Will Never Be Defeated chant that Ben
02:28:08 brought up
02:28:10 Why not make it rhyme?
02:28:12 The difference here is that some people
02:28:14 actually did sing divided
02:28:16 and there was like first time
02:28:18 they were kind of confused and then we kind of went back
02:28:20 and forth between which one
02:28:22 was like dominant
02:28:24 which all of us
02:28:26 to say I got to rhyme
02:28:28 I got to sing it in rhymes
02:28:30 when you did it in Ben saint, how does it feel?
02:28:32 They weren't united in what they were saying
02:28:34 When I
02:28:36 heard that chant I think there were some people
02:28:38 around who were saying divided and they
02:28:40 seemed a little confused that the
02:28:42 bulk of the chanting
02:28:44 was defeated
02:28:46 The People United
02:28:48 Will Never Be Confused
02:28:50 But we were though
02:28:52 Oh no, well
02:28:54 we're not united, that's how it works
02:28:56 Next one is Ben's Weekly
02:28:58 Reminder Play Delta Rune Chapter 2
02:29:00 I'm playing Mega Man right now
02:29:02 leave me alone but also
02:29:04 I had a good old
02:29:06 good old go back
02:29:08 and listen to Toby Fox Music
02:29:10 for a few hours the other day
02:29:12 it's like ah you know what
02:29:14 music sure is great
02:29:16 mood improved
02:29:18 It's okay I guess
02:29:20 I want to learn
02:29:22 Rude Buster on the piano, I feel like that
02:29:24 would be a good thing
02:29:26 Which is Rude Buster the
02:29:28 Delta Rune battle theme?
02:29:30 Yeah
02:29:32 It's kind of like
02:29:34 kind of jazzy
02:29:42 That one? Yeah
02:29:44 I think I remember
02:29:46 I mean he makes
02:29:48 a good
02:29:50 He makes a spicy soundtrack
02:29:52 He makes a good chiptune
02:29:54 No one denies
02:29:56 that
02:29:58 But then I was going back to
02:30:00 Undertale and the
02:30:02 I lost music and like
02:30:04 My favorite
02:30:06 It's so good
02:30:08 I might actually replay Undertale soon
02:30:10 I've said that
02:30:12 when the demo came out
02:30:14 when Undertale was only a demo
02:30:16 I loved the Toriel fight
02:30:18 Heartbreak, right? It's called Heartbreak
02:30:20 Yeah
02:30:22 I love Heartbreak so much I listen to it on repeat
02:30:24 for like days
02:30:28 It's great
02:30:30 He's pretty good
02:30:32 at all that shit

02:31:08 3, 2, 1, go
02:31:10 You know I didn't pick up on the irony
02:31:12 of the fact that in the last voicemail I left
02:31:14 where I said half the people were saying
02:31:16 will never be defeated and the other half were saying
02:31:18 will never be defeated means then
02:31:20 that the people were literally divided
02:31:22 over what they were singing so never mind
02:31:24 I was just wrong
02:31:26 and bad
02:31:28 Get picked up on it

02:32:28 Next one and this is the last one
02:32:30 is called
02:32:32 Redneck Jimmy has a question
02:32:34 Question
02:32:36 3, 2, 1, go
02:32:38 Howdy PCP
02:32:40 This is Redneck Jimmy here
02:32:42 I've been a long time listener of the PCP
02:32:44 and I'm a big fan
02:32:46 but I've always had a question that has somehow
02:32:48 been addressed on the show before
02:32:50 and I think it's a dagum good question too
02:32:52 I can't wait
02:32:54 What is your favorite anime?
02:32:56 Now anime, that is some gay shit
02:32:58 I mean, what is your favorite anime?
02:33:00 That is to say
02:33:02 What's your favorite animated bovine?
02:33:04 Yeehaw
02:33:06 Well
02:33:08 That's all I had to ask
02:33:10 Love you guys
02:33:12 Muah
02:33:14 Muah
02:33:16 Make out Redneck Jimmy
02:33:18 Animated bovine
02:33:20 I'm trying to think of if there even is
02:33:22 one
02:33:24 Well there's the DreamWorks
02:33:26 Home on the Range
02:33:28 Cats
02:33:30 Yeah I guess so
02:33:32 So I guess it's them
02:33:34 I can't think of any others
02:33:36 I'm trying to think of like
02:33:38 Oh, is there like a good
02:33:40 animated film about the Minotaur?
02:33:42 Is there a good animated Minotaur?
02:33:44 I can't think of one
02:33:46 There must be
02:33:50 Wait a bovine
02:33:52 What is that not a
02:33:54 Well it is a cow but I think
02:33:56 giraffes are bovines too
02:33:58 Kaku then
02:34:00 Yeah, I think it might
02:34:02 have to be Kaku
02:34:04 From one piece
02:34:06 I mean he ate the Ushi Ushi
02:34:08 He ate the cow cow fruit model giraffe
02:34:10 Oh yeah
02:34:12 And he's a square giraffe
02:34:14 It's the funniest giraffe
02:34:16 ever put to animation
02:34:18 I would have to say
02:34:20 I would have to think that's probably true
02:34:22 Okay let me see here
02:34:24 There's the guy from
02:34:26 the giraffe from Madagascar
02:34:28 and then there's Kaku who would win
02:34:32 You know it's anyone's game
02:34:38 Okay the four horned antelope
02:34:40 The nil guy
02:34:42 Water buffalo
02:34:44 Anoas
02:34:46 Tamaras
02:34:48 Gars, Yaks
02:34:50 Coopries
02:34:52 Domestic cattle
02:34:54 Sayola
02:34:56 I don't even know what some of these are
02:34:58 These are all
02:35:00 That thing doesn't, the Sayola doesn't even look like a
02:35:02 What the fuck
02:35:04 Hang on, look at this
02:35:06 Look at this creature
02:35:08 Are deer's bovine
02:35:10 That has the markings
02:35:12 on that and the shadows make it look
02:35:14 low poly somehow
02:35:16 Like it's neck
02:35:18 It's like a vertex
02:35:20 or a lion, whatever you call it
02:35:22 You know
02:35:24 I'm not seeing giraffe on here
02:35:26 So maybe it's not
02:35:28 a bovine, but I kind of want to
02:35:30 call it one anyway
02:35:34 Let me see the loot
02:35:36 To find out
02:35:38 what the classification of a giraffe
02:35:40 is
02:35:42 It's a hoofed mammal
02:35:46 It's a pecorra
02:35:48 Pecorra giraffeaday
02:35:50 Okay no, it is not a bovine
02:35:52 A bovine is a pecorra
02:35:56 And then under pecorra there's
02:35:58 Servaday and then whatever's
02:36:00 not a servaday is either a bovine
02:36:02 or a muscaday
02:36:04 I think that's like a deer
02:36:08 Okay, so bovines are like yaks
02:36:10 Yaks, antelopes, buffalo
02:36:14 Yeah, okay, things I normally
02:36:16 associate with
02:36:20 I guess there's the
02:36:22 yaks from My Little Pony
02:36:26 There's the buffalo from My Little Pony
02:36:28 Oh wait a minute
02:36:30 There's the cows from My Little Pony
02:36:32 Okay, I don't know any others
02:36:34 I'm going to say the answer is
02:36:36 unicorns and my justification
02:36:38 for that
02:36:40 is that in the Bible
02:36:42 in the Bible
02:36:44 the King James version
02:36:46 God
02:36:48 Flem
02:36:50 The King James version of the Bible
02:36:52 includes mention of unicorns
02:36:54 in the original
02:36:56 Hebrew
02:36:58 the word is reem
02:37:00 and reem
02:37:02 is probably not meant to
02:37:04 refer to a unicorn as we
02:37:06 perceive it
02:37:08 it was probably meant to
02:37:10 refer to
02:37:12 something else like an oryx
02:37:14 or a wild ox or a bull
02:37:16 or a buffalo or a rhinoceros perhaps
02:37:18 so
02:37:20 I'm going to go
02:37:22 with the biblical unicorn on the assumption
02:37:24 that it is either an ox
02:37:26 or a buffalo or an antelope
02:37:28 if it's a rhinoceros then that doesn't count
02:37:30 so the reem, thank you
02:37:32 good question
02:37:34 yes
02:37:36 and here, check this out
02:37:38 check this out, it was animated
02:37:40 because they made a fucking
02:37:42 tile mosaic about it
02:37:44 in ancient times
02:37:46 that's not an animation
02:37:48 you just have to run past it really fast
02:37:50 and then it moves
02:37:52 that's how they watched movies back then
02:37:54 do you think
02:37:56 did they ever do
02:37:58 a cave painting
02:38:00 or a hallway mural
02:38:02 where it's a sequence of events
02:38:04 and the goal is
02:38:06 you're supposed to run down the hallway
02:38:08 and it may be blinking
02:38:10 really fast and it makes you think
02:38:12 it's one image after another
02:38:14 I feel like that's something someone
02:38:16 would have tried
02:38:18 maybe would have tried
02:38:20 I feel like if you're in a cave
02:38:22 with
02:38:24 a fire in your hand
02:38:26 you'd probably slip and hit yourself
02:38:28 no, it probably wouldn't have been
02:38:30 run into a wall
02:38:32 I'm thinking it would have been not in like a cave
02:38:34 like caveman, I'm thinking it would have been
02:38:36 in maybe like a palace
02:38:38 of some
02:38:40 some king or something
02:38:42 like the kings or the emperors
02:38:44 like running around like I love this
02:38:46 I love this one
02:38:48 I don't know maybe
02:38:50 running around in a circle watching it
02:38:52 sort of a diversion or an amusement
02:38:54 there's some built some hallway of
02:38:56 hey if you run down this hallway
02:38:58 and you blink really fast and you look at the wall
02:39:00 you can see, I don't know
02:39:02 fucking Amaterasu
02:39:04 descending from the heavens or whatever
02:39:06 I feel like something like that would be
02:39:08 something kids do
02:39:10 more readily than adults
02:39:12 which is why tapestries and stuff
02:39:14 they show the sequence of events
02:39:16 but like
02:39:18 snapshots rather than
02:39:20 actual animation
02:39:22 right, like the goal is not
02:39:24 to like, I'm just thinking like
02:39:26 cause someone had to think
02:39:28 you know that like wheel
02:39:30 you look in one side of the wheel and you spin it
02:39:32 and you look at the other side and you can see
02:39:34 the horse running
02:39:38 yeah
02:39:40 like that
02:39:42 like that's animation
02:39:44 and like flip books have been a thing
02:39:46 for a long time, flip books are a kind of animation
02:39:48 but like before that
02:39:50 I don't know, maybe
02:39:52 did they try other stuff that like just didn't work
02:39:54 very well
02:39:56 the reason I brought up cave paintings
02:39:58 I think my hallway idea would probably work
02:40:00 I feel like someone somewhere
02:40:02 probably tried it, cause what else are you gonna do
02:40:04 when it's ancient times and there's no
02:40:06 TV
02:40:08 the reason I brought up
02:40:10 like cave paintings and stuff though is
02:40:12 there was a discovery
02:40:14 that a cave painting that looked
02:40:16 like they had drawn
02:40:18 the same thing
02:40:20 like over layered
02:40:22 and they couldn't make sense of like why it looked like that
02:40:24 but then under like
02:40:26 firelight
02:40:28 if you move the fire from around the wall
02:40:30 the shadows cast on the
02:40:32 like the indents that they made
02:40:34 like carvings into the wall would change
02:40:36 what you could see
02:40:38 and what you couldn't so they would have
02:40:40 like a very primitive like literally very primitive
02:40:42 like flip book
02:40:44 like left to right up down
02:40:46 changing the scene
02:40:48 in real time as you move
02:40:50 the fire around
02:40:52 that's like that they realized that's how
02:40:54 they viewed these things
02:40:56 instead of with a direct source of light
02:40:58 like a flashlight
02:41:00 and they got a sense of like
02:41:02 ah this is a
02:41:04 a little old caveman movie
02:41:06 theater
02:41:08 wow
02:41:10 I've never heard of that
02:41:12 what was it do you remember like what it was a scene of
02:41:16 I think it was like an elephant
02:41:18 a mammoth hunt or something
02:41:20 some sort of hunting thing where they would have
02:41:22 the if you look at the image
02:41:24 fully lit
02:41:26 it doesn't really make sense
02:41:28 what you're looking at
02:41:30 but if you have like
02:41:32 the candle
02:41:34 or like a flame
02:41:36 the flickering
02:41:38 creates like an illusion
02:41:40 of movement and it's pretty cool
02:41:44 and it makes sense because they
02:41:46 would not have been able to see
02:41:48 inside the cave without fire
02:41:50 because they didn't have any other alternatives
02:41:52 would it have given sort of the same effect
02:41:54 that like
02:41:56 in a cartoon like
02:41:58 you have it's like
02:42:00 the character is standing still but you sort of draw
02:42:02 you animate them with two
02:42:04 frames so like you flicker back and forth
02:42:06 between the two frames and it's sort of
02:42:08 looks like at least three but yeah
02:42:10 well yeah the wobbly lion stuff
02:42:12 yeah
02:42:14 I don't know because I haven't seen video of it
02:42:16 but I did read about it
02:42:18 they invented wobbly lion
02:42:20 pseudo animation
02:42:22 I guess
02:42:24 they got like Ed Ed and Eddie in the cave
02:42:26 yes they invented Ed Ed and Eddie
02:42:28 it's a timeless
02:42:30 transcends era
02:42:32 uh
02:42:34 yeah well that's the last
02:42:36 voicemail unless someone sent in a last
02:42:38 minute one
02:42:40 nope

02:46:02 good to have that done so that's nice
02:46:04 uh
02:46:06 I am going to
02:46:08 uh
02:46:10 gonna play oblivion
02:46:12 some more
02:46:14 okay
02:46:16 I have like how many
02:46:18 how many things like five
02:46:20 the uh commissions
02:46:22 left to do I was only really stuck
02:46:24 on one you know when you get like yeah
02:46:26 but when you get stuck on yeah I know
02:46:28 exactly when you lose your momentum
02:46:30 when you lose your momentum and go to the next one it's like
02:46:32 ah but that's still in my head that
02:46:34 I should be doing that one but I think I've got
02:46:36 it I think I've I have like
02:46:38 what it takes to finish that one and then
02:46:40 at least that's
02:46:42 done
02:46:44 yeah don't know when I'll do it
02:46:46 I'll try maybe tonight to do a little bit
02:46:48 so I'll open up the the the program that's
02:46:50 the bare minimum I think it's the hardest
02:46:52 part is starting but if the the goal
02:46:54 of starting is to open the program
02:46:56 you end up starting easier I think
02:46:58 opening up the program really
02:47:00 is
02:47:02 I do when it's like
02:47:04 when I just do that I already it's already
02:47:06 like okay I did I did the first
02:47:08 step I did I've already
02:47:10 made some progress yeah
02:47:12 it seems silly but it really is
02:47:14 like it feels when you're thinking of I've
02:47:16 got to finish that you don't want to
02:47:18 open the program but if your goal is I
02:47:20 got to open the program tonight
02:47:22 and then you do it it's like well
02:47:24 maybe we'll draw some lines
02:47:26 yeah
