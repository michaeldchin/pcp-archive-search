00:00:00 So, one of my favorite things about Jesse's podcast, especially the perfect cast, is
00:00:29 that he'll actually record it in segments over the course of like a week or however
00:00:34 long it takes to set up the podcast. It's something that had never really occurred to
00:00:38 me. You know, it's sort of a thing that you're, a luxury you're afforded by doing a solo podcast
00:00:44 as opposed to having other guests because you don't have to organize a bunch of people
00:00:48 to get together more than once, you know, in the course of a, of however long you can
00:00:53 just record segments and throw them in and it's, it's no biggie. So I wanted to do that.
00:00:58 This is being recorded on the 24th, right after having woken up after releasing the
00:01:06 previous podcast. I actually passed out listening to my own podcast. I did not make it all the
00:01:11 way through. I just sort of had it on and then crashed that fucking theme of, of guts
00:01:19 from Berserk, man. It's a, it's a real soothing track. So anyways, I wanted to continue with
00:01:26 thought that I like kind of cut myself off with in there where I was rambling so much
00:01:32 about how scatterbrained I am that I scatterbrainedly forgot what I was going to say. Because
00:01:37 I was saying that towards the beginning I said that when I go out to eat or something
00:01:43 or like celebrate after releasing a video that it creates a sort of bad habit and I said
00:01:48 I'd get back to it and I never did. Well, here's the explanation of that that I realized
00:01:52 over the last week, which is that by not having the catharsis of having accomplished something,
00:02:01 I think it helps to drive me to keep creating stuff like out of desperation because like
00:02:08 for me, you know, that moment when the video goes live and I see the first couple comments
00:02:15 that I sort of confirmed that it's there is like the big release, you know, it's like,
00:02:20 it's the coming night and day, if you will, of like finishing, you know, I've written
00:02:24 something that I'm proud of and I feel great about it, but it's not until it's out there
00:02:30 that it feels over, you know, that like the thing is done and now I can just bask in the
00:02:36 glory of having done it, you know. So when I put out a video, when one actually releases,
00:02:42 that's when I feel like the, ah, now I have done something, then I tend to, you know,
00:02:47 calm down and relax and do other stuff and not feel the need to, you know, stress over
00:02:54 the next video as much. But I think that because of the way that like I gave DeVu these two
00:03:00 videos to edit and I've been working on all this other stuff, then like there's been no,
00:03:05 like with the novel or the videos that I've been working on, there's been no sense of
00:03:08 release yet because all six videos are not out, you know, DeVu hasn't even, hasn't even
00:03:14 considered starting working on them because he's working on the previous videos and we
00:03:17 still have one more that we want to do before September's over that we haven't even started
00:03:21 on yet, not September, October. But anyways, yeah, so all these things that are piling
00:03:26 up, it helps to feel itself where it's like I can keep working and working because I haven't
00:03:32 felt that any of these projects have concluded, so it's easier to, you know, keep going through
00:03:37 that stuff. Which is kind of why I, like part of the reason I've slowed down vlogs a bit
00:03:45 because when I was doing tons and tons of vlogs, it was like this constant sensation
00:03:49 of getting things done, which was at some point when it was like at its most height,
00:03:56 like when I was just doing shit tons of vlogs, like after the summer season of anime and
00:04:00 I was like covering all the, or was it the spring season? The spring season. When the
00:04:04 spring season ended and like I covered all those shows, then there was a brief period
00:04:09 where I wasn't working on the main channel quite as much and part of that was because
00:04:12 I was, you know, building up to this whole everyone moving in thing and I really thought
00:04:16 I was going to like make vlogs, the central focus of my channel, which I still have plans
00:04:21 to make vlogs a bigger focus. Me and Victor just finally got the lighting setup done for
00:04:26 the studio space that we have that you've, that the plebe and the weave was filmed in.
00:04:31 I mean, we were using Victor's like professional lighting kit for that and we probably will
00:04:36 again for the plebe and the weave because that one's a little bit higher for production
00:04:39 value, but like with the original concept of building the studio was that I wanted there
00:04:44 to be lights that are just in there and that once the studio was set up, it would be very
00:04:49 easy to just walk in, turn everything on and start filming. You know, I wanted it to be
00:04:54 a setup that, that, that if I wanted to do just casual vlogs with like me and whoever
00:05:00 else was with me, then we could easily set it up and easily shoot it and it would look
00:05:06 professional enough that it could go on the main channel, but it wouldn't be like a super
00:05:10 high production value video, you know. So we finally got the lights set up to make that
00:05:16 possible and I just need to finish building the set and then, you know, I haven't been
00:05:20 vlogging currently because I'm working on all these huge projects, but like the fact that
00:05:26 I already have six videos written, like if we decided not to go through with a video
00:05:30 every day for all of November, I still have more than enough videos to cover November.
00:05:35 So like, you know, at some point when I've written so far ahead of myself that I've got
00:05:39 like months worth of backlog ready to go, then vlogging will be easy because I'll just
00:05:45 be like, wow, all my work for this month is completely done so I can just do whatever
00:05:50 I want, let's vlog, you know, or just keep my backlog going, just keep building it bigger
00:05:56 and bigger until I've got like a, you know, I've gotten way ahead of myself, which would
00:06:00 be great. Getting ahead of yourself is something that I think every creative wants and none
00:06:05 of us have pulled off, you know. Everyone I know talks about how badly they want to
00:06:10 have a backlog. Everyone really wants or at least to have, you know, just to have, God,
00:06:19 to be a couple weeks ahead of yourself, to not always feel like you're at the end of
00:06:23 your rope at the end of the month, like, oh my God, I have to have something come out,
00:06:26 you know, in the next few days, we're also not going to make any money this month, you
00:06:30 know, like to already have that financial guarantee allows you to go and experiment and
00:06:37 do other things in the meantime, which is why I wanted my Patreon to get so high and
00:06:40 it has gotten to that point where like I've got enough money now that I can make a few
00:06:44 videos and then go experiment and go do whatever I want, you know, or in the case of like the
00:06:53 early months of this year, me and DeVoo were like following a tight schedule where I was
00:06:56 like planning out all the videos that were going to happen in a month and then I'd give
00:06:59 him the plans and we were like editing down to a specific time frame. But yeah, we can
00:07:06 keep doing stuff like that now and so the vlogs will probably start coming. But yeah,
00:07:14 I do think that there's some value in just stockpiling stuff and never getting that sense
00:07:21 of like, I'm just done, oh, we put out a video, I feel so good, I don't feel like I have to
00:07:26 do anything else for the rest of the week, you know, it's a lot more intense and I like
00:07:31 it this way because like it might sound like, well, you know, that lack of gratification
00:07:37 must be, you know, must make it difficult. It's like, you know, it's not, it's like not
00:07:42 jacking off for a whole week. But you know what happens when you don't do that is that
00:07:46 you, at the end, when you finally do, then it's bigger and better than ever before. And
00:07:53 so, but the thing is that, you know, oh God, I can't stop with this jacking off metaphor
00:08:00 so I apologize ahead of time. But the thing is that the act of jacking off is already
00:08:05 the part that feels good, you know, the big after you come, then you just feel like bored
00:08:11 and miserable. So really, it's like I'm edging my way through all these videos and it feels
00:08:16 great because I'm constantly writing and writing makes me feel great or working on videos
00:08:21 makes me feel great. So it's like this nonstop edging and thankfully, unlike with, with masturbation,
00:08:29 it doesn't eventually give you blue balls and start to hurt. Although I guess my back
00:08:34 hurts a lot from sitting in this chair for like two weeks straight, you know, and not
00:08:39 moving and not doing anything. So I guess that's the blue balls of the writing world.
00:08:43 I apologize for how disgusting this metaphor got.
00:08:47 Alright, this is section two. It's around five in the morning on the 26th of October
00:08:56 and I just woke up, but I wanted to talk about some stuff. I'm going to talk shop for a little
00:09:03 bit. I'm going to talk about some of the secrets of how I do my work and how I, how I approach
00:09:11 trying to have a successful YouTube channel because I know some people who are really
00:09:20 like all about chasing the numbers, chasing success, trying to, you know, make something
00:09:26 that appeals to the highest number of people or is like trendy or just like, you know,
00:09:32 what can I cover that everyone wants to see right now? And there's other people who are
00:09:38 completely against even attempting to, you know, curve their content towards mass appeal
00:09:46 and personally, I kind of fall not so much in the middle, so much as all-encompassing.
00:09:53 What my goal has always been is how can I talk about whatever I want and make people care
00:09:59 about it? You know, how can I drive people towards my opinions and my content and the
00:10:04 things I want to talk about? Like, how can I make them want to engage with this? So,
00:10:11 you know, and I'm not saying that every project can do this. Sometimes I do stuff just because
00:10:17 I feel like it. Like Akiyuki Shinbo in the 90s, a video series that as I mentioned in
00:10:21 the last episode of this, like, I never expected it to be huge. Now, Akiyuki Shinbo is a pretty
00:10:30 well-known anime director, so I knew this was not going to be like a go nowhere series
00:10:35 in the way that it would be if, say, I had made a video called Shinichiro Kobayashi in
00:10:42 the ever, you know, no one knows who that is, which is why that video is called the master
00:10:46 in the background of 40 years of Japanese anime or whatever it's called. So, yeah, like,
00:10:54 with Shinbo I knew I could at least use his name, but you know, the first video it's got
00:10:58 a big face of Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho because it's the most popular show that Shinbo worked
00:11:04 on, the one that would probably get the most people to click on it on the basis of what
00:11:08 character was on the thumbnail. And I don't think anyone truly appreciates how fucking
00:11:15 important the thumbnail and title are for a YouTube video success. No one seems to get
00:11:21 it. Like, I keep telling people and they're like, okay, yeah, sure, that seems right,
00:11:26 you know, and I keep showing them the numbers and how they correlate. They're like, okay,
00:11:29 I guess, you know, but no one, you don't understand. The only thing that matters if you want your
00:11:35 video to be successful is the title and the fucking thumbnail. That's it. That is all
00:11:40 that matters because no one knows what the content of your video is until they click
00:11:46 on it. No one has any idea, you know, they don't know how great your video is. They don't
00:11:51 know how genius it is. They don't know what's going on with it. In fact, they don't really
00:11:56 know that until it gets to a point where it's genius, you know, I think one of the biggest
00:12:03 reasons that endless Jess has never, you know, gotten the like a claim that he deserves is
00:12:08 because he takes too much of an artistic approach to his videos where his titles are always
00:12:14 very clever, especially if you know the video, you always are like, wow, that's a that's
00:12:19 a genius title, but it's not clickbait, you know, or have a great thumbnail that's like
00:12:24 really iconically staged, but it's not clickbait. Because what clickbait is is a close up of
00:12:29 someone's face. It always is that it's always a close up of someone's face. And if you like
00:12:37 take the YouTube tutoring shit, like where, you know, you get contacts from YouTube themselves
00:12:42 and like have advice with them, they tell you this, they tell you like close ups of faces.
00:12:46 That's what works, you know, I started doing it after Game Grumps talked about it. Like
00:12:50 they said that, you know, they had looked at all the big channels, all the market research
00:12:55 and everyone who was successful was saying, yeah, close ups of faces, because it's just
00:13:01 the most like intimate human connection, you can form with something instantly, you see
00:13:06 a bright starry face, you know, you just want to click on her or a or a gross face or someone
00:13:12 making a face, you know, some kind of reaction face, they always work. It's why like the
00:13:17 React series, the, you know, whoever reacts to whatever series is like always three pictures
00:13:22 of people's faces making different extreme reactions, you know, or why every big YouTuber,
00:13:28 you know, puts themselves edited into the thumbnails. You know, we were parodying that
00:13:33 with Movie News Weekly, my brother's hilarious video that's on Digibro After Dark. And like,
00:13:43 I understand why that could be frustrating for people. Like someone like Jesse, I don't
00:13:47 see him ever trying to curb himself to like have every video have a face thumbnail. He
00:13:53 would not do that because it would be artistically dissatisfying, you know, that instead of coming
00:13:59 up with these genius thumbnails that he does for every video that aren't clickbait, but
00:14:03 they are great thumbnails, you know, to instead try to make stuff that appeals to everybody.
00:14:09 Now for me, what I enjoy the most is when I get to have my cake and eat it too. When
00:14:16 I get to do exactly what I want to do, but also convince people that they want the same
00:14:21 thing. So that's why I go all out on the clickbait of the thumbnails and the titles. Because
00:14:27 to me, those are the least important elements of my video anyway. You know, those are an
00:14:32 afterthought. They have nothing to do with the actual content of the video. The job of
00:14:36 the title and the thumbnail is just to get people to click on the video. And especially
00:14:41 if I can somehow get you, if I can have a thumbnail and a title that are just dishonest
00:14:51 enough to get you to click on the video, but not so dishonest that you feel lied to after
00:14:56 you watch the video, that's the perfect sweet spot. That's what I'm always going for. It's
00:15:02 how can I title this in a way that, so like, you know, I just put out this video called
00:15:06 10 anime music videos you should check out. Now you, you already know that the clickbait
00:15:13 formula is top 10s. All the biggest anime channels are top 10 channels, best anime tops or like,
00:15:21 you know, Misty Kronexia, they do top 10s. It's just a clean number that people always
00:15:27 want to know. Now I didn't do top 10 anime music videos and that would have gotten even
00:15:33 better results probably, but I just didn't want to do that because I didn't want to put
00:15:38 these in order and I was making a lot more than 10 and like, it just wasn't what I wanted
00:15:43 to do. But 10 in itself is a great thing to have up there. You know, it's a great way
00:15:48 to get people to look just any kind of number, any kind of round solid number is always great.
00:15:53 And I didn't want it to say 15 or 20 because I actually recommend like 20 videos. If it
00:15:59 said 20, then it's overwhelming. It's like, oh, I don't, I don't think I'm going to have
00:16:03 time to watch 20 anime music videos, you know, but if it's 10, it's like, hmm, I could probably
00:16:10 watch all that and an hour, you know, that's anime music videos three minutes long, you
00:16:15 know, of course I want to know what 10 anime music videos I should watch right now, you
00:16:18 know, the video is 15 minutes long suggests that maybe this won't take you all day. But
00:16:23 of course it's a lot more than 10 recommendations. But if it said 17 or 18, it's not the same.
00:16:29 It's not the same as 10. But no one's going to complain that they got more than 10. No
00:16:36 one's going to say like, oh, you bastard, you tricked me. There were more than 10 in
00:16:41 this video. If anything, they're all happy about it. I mean, a bunch of people have pointed
00:16:44 it out. Most of them think it's funny because it is funny. It's kind of a joke. And that's
00:16:48 why at the end of the video, I call attention to it. I'm like, that was like 10 or so music
00:16:53 videos, I guess, whatever this video is long. Now let's move on, you know, like the joke
00:16:58 sort of is it was more than 10. And, you know, that's the kind of thing that I love doing
00:17:06 the most is if I can if I can give you a title that you you go, you know, and this happens
00:17:15 to varying degrees, people were a little bit more wary of like, how to recognize a great
00:17:21 anime in just one episode or how to recognize a terrible anime in just one episode, because
00:17:25 those titles weren't exactly what I was doing. They were, you know, close enough, in my opinion,
00:17:31 and I didn't really have a better title for those videos. But they were close enough to
00:17:35 the same thing as what I was doing that, you know, and some people did call out like this
00:17:40 is not actually what the video is. And I was like, yeah, that's kind of fair. But what
00:17:45 would you have titled this video? You know, like it's it is what it is kind of and the
00:17:50 title is what would be the most attention grabbing and it worked wonders. Those titles
00:17:55 and those thumbnails were unbelievably successful, especially the one for how to recognize a terrible
00:18:01 anime in just one episode, super provocative title, you know, people want to know how to
00:18:06 do that, people want to know why you think you can do that, you know, they're upset immediately.
00:18:13 And I've got this super close up of the super cute girl from gate just staring right into
00:18:18 the camera looking moe as fuck. Because you got to remember that even though the anime
00:18:25 sphere talks so much shit about cute girls, they overwhelmingly adore cute girls. There's
00:18:34 a reason cute girls are so fucking successful and popular, you know, it's kind of like how
00:18:39 even though Kaon gets shit talked all the time by people who are like, oh, this is the
00:18:44 death of anime, everything's cute girls, that show is super successful. Tons of people have
00:18:49 seen that, you know, both in Japan and the West. I mean, it wasn't as successful here
00:18:53 in terms of like sales figures because I mean, Bandai did a terrible job of releasing most
00:18:58 of the things they released in the late 2000s at way overpriced prices when everyone else
00:19:03 was slashing their prices down to nothing and not really advertising shows like Kaon,
00:19:08 at least not in the US. So it's kind of perplexing that they were like releasing it for these
00:19:14 high budget, you know, high budget release but not really advertising it that well. We're
00:19:20 like, you know, letting people know what it is or what the appeal is. But yeah, like,
00:19:26 I feel like, you know, people want so badly to portray this image that we're totally not
00:19:31 about cute girls, but they are. They are totally about cute girls by and large, you know. Maybe
00:19:36 those people aren't the ones leaving the comments because the people commenting about anime are
00:19:41 the ones who are dissatisfied. The people who are satisfied have no reason to raise hell
00:19:45 about how many cute girls there are, but the cute girls are the most popular. So if you
00:19:49 post some cute girl, if you post a hot anime girl in your picture, you know, Misty Kronexia
00:19:55 is like disgusting without he games the system, you know, he just straight up posts like the
00:19:59 most pornographic thumbnails he can get away with. And of course people click on it because
00:20:05 like, I mean, every time I see one, I'm like, I come very close to clicking on it. I'm like,
00:20:10 I want to know what this incredibly hot anime girl is from, but I know I'm not going to
00:20:14 get the answer because I know the formula. I know that Misty Kronexia is just putting
00:20:19 that thumbnail there. So you'll click on the video and then you'll have to, you know,
00:20:23 look at his fucking bald ass while he like talks to you about a bunch of other bullshit
00:20:28 that I don't care about. And I'm never going to find that thumbnail that I wanted that I
00:20:33 came for. So that's why, you know, and I'm not willing to go that far because I have a
00:20:39 brand. I have a brand that is somewhat classy, somewhat, you know, approachable, somewhat
00:20:47 like this guy appeal. I want to simultaneously appeal to hardcore otaku while also suggesting
00:20:53 to the people who are embarrassed about hardcore otaku that they can totally watch the videos
00:20:58 as well. You know, whereas like Misty Kronexia, I don't, I think a lot of people would be
00:21:02 embarrassed to say that they liked him, you know, whereas the people who just don't care,
00:21:10 especially younger people who just don't give a fuck are going to watch all the videos.
00:21:14 So, you know, I want to hit that middle ground. But again, for me, it's all about these middle
00:21:19 grounds. It's all about maximum viewer engagement. But like in terms of getting the most views
00:21:26 possible while still making what I wanted to make. And it can never be lazy, because
00:21:33 like I don't want to make lazy videos. I don't want to make videos that are just about getting
00:21:37 clicks. I want people to click on a video that I thought was great. And I'm going to
00:21:43 make them think it's great. So with the anime music videos thing, like for me, what was the
00:21:48 in what made that video fulfilling is that this video comes out for the song called Shelter.
00:21:54 Like it's super big. Everyone's talking about it. And I think, A, I can capitalize on the
00:21:59 success of Shelter to talk about a part of the medium that I'm a big fan of that people
00:22:04 don't talk about enough. You know, I love anime music videos. I get this is now a platform
00:22:09 being afforded to me to share ones that I like. I also want to have seen them all and
00:22:14 to be able to suggest all the good ones I can think of. Now we'll say, um, god damn,
00:22:21 there's a lot of people who are commenting with like, why not this show? Why not that
00:22:25 one? Why didn't you include this? A lot of them are ones I just haven't seen because
00:22:29 in spite of the fact that I see, I said I've seen them all. There's some that are not really
00:22:34 because I watched everything that's considered a music video by my anime list. So anything
00:22:39 that's not professionally released, you know, I didn't watch some of the animator expo shorts
00:22:44 that I still haven't seen yet were music videos, which I fucking tried to look into that. I
00:22:48 like looked up, you know, which ones are music videos. I didn't get like any results that were
00:22:52 helpful. So that's why I didn't include more animator expo ones because I wasn't sure which
00:22:56 one are music videos and I haven't seen all of the animator expo yet. But I can probably
00:23:00 just do a video about the animator expo at a later date. But you know, there's there's
00:23:05 a few I didn't include said and seen him some because I just didn't care for them and stuff.
00:23:09 But like, you know, ultimately the point of the video was to just share a bunch of them.
00:23:15 It wasn't about like, here's a comprehensive list, nor was it about here's a top list.
00:23:20 A lot of people seem to think this was a top 10, which was not at all the case, but you
00:23:25 know, whatever. So but the idea was like, let's have seen all the music videos that
00:23:33 I that I can and let's share all these cool ones and like get people to watch something
00:23:39 that they wouldn't have watched otherwise that they would never have known existed.
00:23:44 So, you know, the amount of research I put into this vastly outweighs what anyone else
00:23:50 would put into a 10 list of any kind, you know, because that's my style. I want to overwhelm
00:23:56 with how much research I do. I want to be that guy who went that far, you know, not
00:24:02 only because it's cool, it makes me look cool, but also because I just that's the kind of
00:24:09 content I want to see. I wish everyone was doing this much research into a top 10 list,
00:24:13 you know, and if I can do that much research for something and pour that much heart and
00:24:18 energy into it and yet still have it managed to be successful, that will be the perfect
00:24:25 thing, you know. So the title and the thumbnail are entirely in service of that and I I capitalized
00:24:32 so hard on shelter for this. Like I just took, you know, I showed clips from it at the start.
00:24:38 I mentioned it. I never mentioned my opinion of it, which is just kind of meh, you know,
00:24:41 I just say, hey, shelter's really popular. Here's a bunch of other anime music videos,
00:24:46 you know, I'm not here to start a fight. I'm not here to make people talk about shelter.
00:24:50 I'm here to make people watch these videos using shelter as the springboard. And of course
00:24:53 I use shelter as the thumbnail. And I would have liked a different thumbnail. I didn't
00:24:58 want it to be the exact same one that the fucking video itself uses. I did crop it to
00:25:04 be a better fit for my style, which is like hyper close up with with blue in the background.
00:25:09 That's the thing. The thumbnail was too perfect, like, because it's super close up of a cute
00:25:13 girl's face and it's got a bright blue sky. And for whatever reason, bright blue does really
00:25:19 well for me. I don't know if this is true of everybody. I don't know if there's any science
00:25:24 behind this. And I have some thumbnails that are on big videos that aren't all blue, but
00:25:28 almost all of my biggest videos are all blue thumbnails. Sword Art Online sucks part one,
00:25:36 blue thumbnail. Why good anime is hard to make? Blue thumbnail. How to recognize a terrible
00:25:41 anime in just one episode? Blue thumbnail. Why one piece works so well? Blue thumbnail.
00:25:47 So and most of them are blue either because of hair or because of the sky. So blue just
00:25:54 seems to be a really attention grabbing thumbnail for whatever kind of audience watches my video.
00:25:59 So I definitely gravitate to and I like them too. I love like blue how it pops off of the
00:26:03 screen and stuff. So, you know, that's why I chose blue hié for that shinbo thing, why
00:26:10 I chose blue sky behind the girl from Shelter. But like, yeah, everything about this video
00:26:15 is meant to say, hey, you like Shelter? Here's more. And like, if I can perfectly capitalize
00:26:24 on the success of Shelter to get people to watch something that is totally my thing and
00:26:30 something they did not at all anticipate getting, then that's perfect. You know, just getting
00:26:36 people to say like, to suggest to the audience that they're going to get the kind of trashy
00:26:41 bullshit they want. You know, they want the top 10. They want the cute girls. They want
00:26:47 the reminder of the thing they already care about like Shelter. They want to just watch
00:26:51 a video about something they already have opinions about and just want reaffirmation
00:26:56 that someone else cares about the thing they care about. So yeah, it looks like it's just
00:27:00 a video about Shelter, but it's not. It's the opposite. It's about a bunch of obscure
00:27:06 shit that no one cares about except me. And I'm now forcing you to care about it if I
00:27:11 can, you know. So yeah, that's sort of my that's that's that's the trick of the trade.
00:27:17 That's what my goal is. Be the most myself possible and get the most people to care about
00:27:23 it possible as opposed to trying to, you know, go to my audience because I don't want to
00:27:30 do that. I don't want to go to them. And when I whenever I try, I regret it, you know, like
00:27:36 when I not to say that I don't like these videos, but I mean, I've made it clear in
00:27:43 the past that like every once in a while I cover a popular show just so that I can have,
00:27:48 you know, something new or current or popular to talk about, you know, usually it's when
00:27:55 I just don't have any other ideas. I'll be like, All right, let's make a video about
00:27:59 what to motay people like what to motay. And that video is huge. Let's make a video about
00:28:04 erased and myriad colors phantom world. Those videos are huge. Cabin airy debt videos huge,
00:28:09 you know, it's a very easy way to to reach success. And I only do it if I have something
00:28:15 to say mob Psycho 100 huge, huge video. All those were the most popular anime of the season
00:28:20 that they were airing. I found something to say about them. So I made a video about it.
00:28:24 And, you know, but the the main thrust of why this show, why cover this show is because it's
00:28:31 the biggest show of the season and people will come to me for it. And, you know, if I was, I
00:28:37 feel like if I was a normal YouTuber, if I was someone like a gig or something, that would be
00:28:41 all I do. I just find the most popular shows and not gig, I meant glass reflection. The gig
00:28:47 is similar. They, you know, they go after what's the talking point? What are people talking about
00:28:52 right now? And they respond to it. And they, you know, they just whip up the audience reaction
00:28:59 they want. Whereas for me, it's like the opposite point. Get people invested, even though they
00:29:06 didn't think they'd care. Use Re Zero as a platform to talk about something else, you know,
00:29:12 which I almost wish that, you know, the, that Planetarian and Re Zero had been reversed,
00:29:19 where we could have had re like use the Re Zero video to tell people to watch Planetarian,
00:29:24 because unfortunately, as expected, my Re Zero, Plebe and the Weeb, it has three times the view
00:29:31 counts of the Planetarian Plebe and the Weeb, you know, so, which is to be expected. But if we
00:29:38 could have diverted people there, that would have been nice. But, you know, the reason Re Zero,
00:29:41 we even covered it on Plebe and the Weeb was to get more attention to Plebe and the Weeb,
00:29:45 a show that people would not have watched. It was, you know, a two guys talking show that
00:29:51 is totally different from my normal content. Nobody really knows who Jesse is. The title is
00:29:57 not Click Beaty, you know, the Plebe and the Weeb is the name of a show. It's not a Click
00:30:03 Beat title that will get like, you know, if I had been trying to make those just Click Beaty,
00:30:09 it would have just been like Re Zero, best or worst show on television or something, you know,
00:30:14 like, because who cares? It doesn't matter what the title of the video is. But with the Plebe and the
00:30:20 Weeb, we want it to be a series and we want it to be recognized as such. But covering Re Zero at
00:30:24 all is a huge boost to the series. You know, if we hadn't covered that show, then there's a good
00:30:31 chance or covered anything popular, you know, like we covered your name because it was new and it
00:30:36 was making waves and Re Zero because it was a huge deal. You know, Planetarian is more of the
00:30:42 kind of show that me and Jesse would be more inclined to watch and more inclined to talk about.
00:30:46 But that video has way fewer views and it would not have gotten Plebe and the Weeb off the ground
00:30:51 and it would have just sank down my channel, you know, though I am impressed by how many views it
00:30:55 did get at least, you know, I think 21k was a pretty healthy amount. Even if that's like,
00:31:01 for my current self, that's like the lowest I'm likely to get at all, you know, like it used to
00:31:07 be that I had videos that, that if it was like no one cared about it, it was below 10k. But now
00:31:11 I'm big enough that like 20k is kind of like the rock bottom I can hit. But nonetheless, I'm glad
00:31:17 that that's the rock bottom I can hit because that's a lot of people and that's a lot of heads
00:31:20 to go watch Planetarian, you know, in go watch Jesse's content. But yeah, and I mean, even with
00:31:28 the thumbnails for Plebe and the Weeb, like, I was going to make the thumbnail for, like, Jesse
00:31:34 made all the thumbnails for it and I would have had your name would have been the image of her
00:31:38 groping her own tits from the start of the movie because we do talk about that scene. I would have
00:31:44 had the Re Zero One would have just been a close-up of Rem and Ram, like as close as I could get
00:31:50 into their faces, but at least they were in there for Jesse's thumbnail. And then with Planetarian,
00:31:55 just, you know, close-up of cute girl's face, like, that's close-up of face. It's, it is a one-way
00:32:01 ticket to your video getting views. And it's so satisfying when you do it and it works, like,
00:32:08 when you put the, like, with the anime is how to recognize a terrible anime in just one episode.
00:32:13 I knew what the thumbnail was going to be immediately when I was watching Gate because,
00:32:18 like, the second that girl's face popped up on camera and it just hogged the whole frame
00:32:23 and it was just this perfect shot of this girl's face, I was like, that's the thumbnail. You know,
00:32:28 like, I figured that out before I was done writing the fucking script and I was so fucking excited
00:32:34 to use it and that video has over a million views. It's my second most viewed, no, yeah,
00:32:39 my second most viewed video of all time. People, the title and the thumbnail. And, like,
00:32:48 I told this to Mother's Basement and he's totally changed the way he does titles and thumbnails
00:32:53 as a result, but he's still not doing it right because he'll put, like, a kind of okay thumbnail
00:33:00 but then he puts his stupid animated avatar over it, which is cartoon guy, which is totally
00:33:07 antithetical to making a good thumbnail and unnecessary and I don't know why he does that.
00:33:10 I keep telling him to stop, but he keeps doing it. It's terrible. It's like, it's cancelling
00:33:16 out the effect of the thumbnail, you know, but he's gotten better with the clickbait titles.
00:33:21 He stopped, you know, it used to be like, what's in an OP? X show and then now it's called like,
00:33:28 how strong is one punch man's punch? What's in an OP? You know, personally, I would cut out
00:33:35 the extra part entirely. I would just make it what it is because there's no reason to have
00:33:39 a series title. It doesn't, the only people who care that it's a part of the series are people
00:33:45 who watch all your videos, you know? Like, if you can come up with a series title that's also
00:33:50 clickbait, like cool character designs is a good clickbaity title for the kind of videos those are.
00:33:55 Like, that's what the video is, is about cool character designs, but it also is eye catching.
00:34:00 Oh, I want to hear about cool character designs, you know? So that's a good clickbait series,
00:34:06 but if it's a series title that doesn't really mean anything to the audience, you know, like in a
00:34:13 major way, like what's in an OP is okay, but it doesn't make me like rush to click in the way
00:34:19 that just saying like, here's what's cool about this show's OP, you know, gets you in.
00:34:23 Um, but, you know, I know Jeff likes to keep things as part of a series and he kind of has
00:34:30 like an older YouTuber mindset because it used to be that, you know, people really wanted things
00:34:34 to be a part of the series so that people like knew that there was more and they knew to go find
00:34:39 more of it. But nowadays, if people want more of your content, they subscribe. Like, YouTube is a
00:34:43 subscriber culture now. It wasn't like that before, you know, back in the day there was, there was
00:34:49 not this push for subscriptions. And when YouTube redesigned the whole website back in like 2013,
00:34:56 they did it around subscriptions. They built it around how do we make people get drawn to the
00:35:01 subscribe button. That's why the subscribe button is dead center in your channel on the page, you
00:35:05 know, like they want to drive people towards subscribing to channels because they realize
00:35:10 that that was the best way for content creators to, you know, keep their audience and keep making
00:35:14 revenue. So yeah, like you really want subscriptions and the people who are subscribed to your
00:35:20 channel, it doesn't matter that it's a series. They get it, you know. Now you can codify your
00:35:25 thumbnails and titles in a way. I think the best way to handle doing a series is color-coded thumbnails.
00:35:31 You know, guys like Chaseface do this well, where, uh, you know, if it's part of one series, then it
00:35:37 all has the same color of thumbnail, but the title and thumbnail can be something clickbaity,
00:35:41 you know. If you want to have, or Glass Reflections does this well too, where he's got like, you
00:35:48 know, if it's a proper review, then it's like a close-up of a character's face and like a blue,
00:35:53 like, techno-y background. And it's like, you know, this anime review. But then if he does like the
00:35:57 impressions, then it's like a gray background. And it's close-up of a face on a gray background.
00:36:01 This is an impressions video. And you can instantly tell looking at his channel like, okay,
00:36:05 there's several different series here, which one am I interested in. Canapa Effect does something
00:36:10 similar. He uses like, blue text for all of his, you know, creator spotlight videos, and then other
00:36:16 kinds of text for other stuff. That's a good method of doing it, because it doesn't take away from
00:36:20 your ability to make things clickbaity, while also notifying it as a series. So, you know.
00:36:27 But anyways, everyone needs to pay more attention to their titles and thumbnails. They're the only
00:36:31 things that matter. The only things that matter for views. The only things. Because you just have
00:36:36 to get them to click the video. That's all that matters. Like, once they're there, they will
00:36:42 find out that it's a genius video and they'll reshare it. You know, if you're making, if you're
00:36:46 making good content, then, then it's going to, you know, it's going to get, um, going to get
00:36:52 reshared once people find it. Once they find out it's good. But they have to find out it's good
00:36:58 first, you know, and they're not going to find out it's good if they're not going to find it.
00:37:03 And if you're not going to click on it in the first place, if it's got a weird title and a
00:37:06 weird thumbnail and people don't understand what the appeal of it is, they're not going to click
00:37:11 on it. Um, so you just got to get your fucking hooks in people and drag them kicking and screaming
00:37:16 over to what you want to do. Alright, that's it for this segment. She's opened up a beer.
00:37:24 So as an addendum to the stuff I was saying like four days ago or for you like one minute ago,
00:37:36 um, advice for YouTubers, tag yourself on all your videos. Your tags have to do with what shows up
00:37:46 in the related videos on the side. And for my whole YouTube career, the overwhelming majority
00:37:53 of hits that I get that aren't from subscribers are from related videos. And if you tag yourself
00:38:00 all the time, it means your own videos are more likely to show up in the related videos.
00:38:05 So always tag your own name, write your own name into the tags. On the PCP, all the tags are pretty
00:38:11 much just the names of all the PCP members. I don't know how well that works, but um,
00:38:17 it's a, you know, it's worth doing. So I got to talk about one of the big things going on with
00:38:24 me right now, which is that I am turning into a fucking monster. This is going to contradict
00:38:30 everything I was saying on the fat fuckery podcast. We were talking about lifting and I was like,
00:38:35 oh, lifting sucks. It just leaves you exhausted all day, blah, blah, blah, and all that shit. Well,
00:38:40 you know, at the start of that podcast, we hadn't finished building the squat rack,
00:38:46 the one that Ben brought with him. We told a whole story about that, but we did like within a couple
00:38:51 days of that podcast. And so me and Ben started lifting. And what I quickly realized is that
00:38:56 lifting is fucking awesome. Now, yes, it does have the negative consequence of being exhausting.
00:39:02 And your muscles feel sore all the time, at least so far mine have, you know, they've never,
00:39:07 because we keep pushing ourselves to higher and higher weights every time we do it. We've never
00:39:11 just been maintenance lifting. It's all strength lifting, all in increasing the amount we lift
00:39:17 every other day. So, you know, it's been a fairly brutal workout schedule, but I feel strong.
00:39:27 And every time, like right after working out, it's just like, you just feel the pump and it's
00:39:31 just like, yes, I can do anything. I am a God, you know, and definitely gives me more of like a
00:39:38 strut and like more just, I don't know, I feel good about whatever I'm doing. And it's funny,
00:39:44 because, you know, so much of my time is spent sitting around and just like, when I'm not sitting
00:39:49 around and probably eating, I say this all the time, how I pretty much just leave the house to go get
00:39:53 food. And, you know, that can make me feel like I'm not doing enough physical activity, like I'm
00:40:00 not getting out enough and stuff like that. But lifting, which only takes like half an hour,
00:40:07 with the lifting, you know, the schedule me and Ben have been doing, is like, it feels like it
00:40:12 meets that need completely. It's like, you know, working yourself to such physical exhaustion
00:40:17 that it's like, yes, I have done my physicality for the day, you know, and now I can feel good
00:40:24 about just sitting down for eight hours doing work, you know, or just getting up to go eat
00:40:29 and stuff like that. I don't feel like I'm hugely missing out on the rest of the world
00:40:34 or just on doing anything physical. And it's, I mean, it's been fun. Me and Ben have been,
00:40:41 you know, doing the workouts together. It's just a fun time to just pump out some iron,
00:40:47 you know, see what we can see how high we can raise our, our fucking lifting amounts and stuff,
00:40:55 feel the gains flowing through us. But here's what's, here's why it's turned me into a monster.
00:41:01 Because ever since we started, started lifting, I can't stop eating. I've been eating constantly in
00:41:09 larger and larger portions. Like I've always been kind of a small eater. There's only been a couple
00:41:15 of times in my life where I've been able to eat like more than normal. And it's usually like,
00:41:20 like, it's like the kind of thing where once you start eating big, you can continue to eat big.
00:41:25 But if you typically don't, then it's like you feel capped out at a lower level, you know,
00:41:31 I'm the type of guy who often doesn't get the side dish with my order, you know,
00:41:35 go, go to a, go to a fast food restaurant. I don't need the fries. I don't need the combo,
00:41:39 you know, buy one, get one free. I might eat half of the second thing, you know,
00:41:43 I've never been someone who eats like a huge portion or even like a normal portion. But
00:41:50 like now ever since I started lifting, it's just been like, I will eat everything in sight.
00:41:56 It doesn't matter. Give me the biggest thing on the menu. I'll fucking put it down. Give me the
00:42:00 two. I need the two. I also need the large drink, you know, I usually can't even finish a fucking
00:42:07 medium sized drink of like soda, you know, with my meal. Now I'm just chugging down these fucking
00:42:13 big ass drinks. I went to Hardee's yesterday. I had like they had a steak, egg and cheese
00:42:18 biscuit, buy one, get one free. I got two. The guy said, do you want a dollar drink? And I'm
00:42:24 like, what the fuck is a dollar drink? And he said, it's cheaper than the small or yeah,
00:42:28 because I think I asked for small, but then he gives me the dollar drink and it's a fucking huge
00:42:31 cup. It's like an extra large drink. And I'm like, I don't know why that's a dollar, but sure, I'll
00:42:35 take it, drink the whole fucking thing, you know, along with eating both steak, egg, and cheese
00:42:40 biscuits, which I am certain I wouldn't have been able to do two weeks ago. It's just given me such
00:42:46 a fucking appetite. And I know that the way I'm eating, because, you know, you're supposed to
00:42:52 eat big to get big. If you're lifting big, you got to eat big, but you got to eat right. You know,
00:42:58 the key is to maximize on protein, but not to eat a bunch of fat and a bunch of sugar,
00:43:03 because if you do, you're going to get, you know, your muscles will get bigger,
00:43:07 but you're also going to get fat. But I, I don't care. Like it feels so gratifying to like pump,
00:43:15 you know, to just lift heavy weight and then be just, and then just go eat everything that I want.
00:43:21 It doesn't matter what I just, I want it. It's going in my mouth. There's no hesitation. There's
00:43:26 no looking at the labels. There's no nothing. I have been eating like a fucking pig, and I know
00:43:31 I'm going to get fat, but I'm going to get strong fat. And I feel like, I feel like I like that.
00:43:37 I want to, I want to be a mosh pit guy. That's what that's the body I think I'm going for is the guy
00:43:44 in the mosh pit at metal shows, which I've been to a considerable number of metal shows. I've been
00:43:48 in a few mosh pits. I'm usually the guy who gets pushed around pretty hard. I usually walk out pretty
00:43:54 bruised, you know, because there's usually at least one guy in there who's some big fat buff
00:43:58 motherfucker with huge muscle, huge chest, huge arms, but you know, like a beer, beer gut.
00:44:05 I see myself being that guy, because honestly, for me, like, I feel like vices
00:44:13 are like, I don't, I don't get the point of life without them to some extent. I guess if you, if
00:44:20 you get really into something like running and it makes you feel like your life has been affirmed
00:44:26 or something like that, like you don't need any vices because you have running, which needs to
00:44:30 be the way that runners act, you know, like a, like a Casey Neistat or even my dad, like my dad
00:44:35 used to smoke and drink all the time. You know, he was like a pack of day smoker. He drank a lot
00:44:41 at parties and shit, completely quit both of those, took up running. That's what he does now.
00:44:46 And maybe that'll be me one day. Maybe in my 30s or so, I'll eventually, you know, my dad started
00:44:52 late. He didn't really start running till it was like late, late 30s, early 40s, I think. But uh,
00:45:00 you know, maybe that'll be me one day. But right now, it's hard for me to go very long without
00:45:06 advice because I start to wonder why am I even alive for this? You know, like why, why be a person
00:45:14 who has to eat healthy and watch what you eat and not drink too much and not smoke? Because those are
00:45:21 the things that make life fun. Those are the things that make it easy to do, to do work all the time.
00:45:28 You know, like to not, I live a lifestyle where all I really want to do is work. That's all I want
00:45:35 to do. All I want to do is watch anime and make videos about anime and make blogs and make podcasts
00:45:40 and, and, you know, collaborate with other creative people. That's like the only desire I really have,
00:45:46 other than like, you know, having interesting conversations. I like doing that, you know,
00:45:51 I take breaks from work to go hang out and talk to people both in real life and online,
00:45:57 you know, offline and online. I don't know why I still say in real life. I hate that being
00:46:03 equated with something different, but it's just such an ingrained phrase. But anyway, yeah, you know,
00:46:08 having interesting conversations is great, making stuff is great, and there's nothing else I really
00:46:14 like to do. I don't really like to leave the house except to eat, you know, that's the only reason I
00:46:18 want to leave. I've done the whole go out and do things stuff. Things aren't interesting. The beach
00:46:24 is not that fun. Mount Trashmore is not that fun. Maybe once a month it's fun to go out and do
00:46:30 something somewhere, you know, gatherings all week. I don't care. I just want to stay home and work.
00:46:37 And all I want to do other than that is stuff that will make me feel like I have not sat in one spot
00:46:45 for eight hours. And there's a few easy ways to not feel that way. One is to get up and go have a
00:46:51 smoke. It's such an easy way to like, I've been working for an hour. I kind of want to just stand
00:46:56 up and have a break. You go outside, you smoke a cigarette, you come back in, you feel ready to
00:47:02 take on the next hour of work. Or I'm about to do a huge editing job that I don't want to do.
00:47:10 Let's have some beers. It'll make this easier, you know, like the other day, what was this, two days
00:47:17 ago, I had, okay, so everything I talked about in the previous podcast is not happening the way I
00:47:24 described it, which is good. And because that leaves me the opportunity now to not describe this
00:47:30 stuff that I am doing in too much detail so that it can still happen. But I'll go into at least
00:47:36 this much, because this is already guaranteed, because I described that I had written six videos
00:47:40 for a month-long project in November to make a ton of videos all at once. I ended up canceling that
00:47:46 project because it was financially retarded to make 15 videos in one month. I obviously can't
00:47:53 Patreon all of them, and I already had got those six ideas that I had that were so good that I like
00:47:59 wrote instantly. Those were all the like ideas I had that I really wanted to do, and all the other
00:48:03 ones I'm looking at like, eh, this, eh, you know, I don't want to write this video. But I have another
00:48:09 project that I am excited about, and I'm just going to get straight to work on that as opposed to
00:48:14 the whole novel of videos in November. So I'm already working on the next big project. But
00:48:19 instead, I now have, you know, six videos that DeVu can make at his own pace over the course of,
00:48:26 one will come out by the end of this month, and the other five will come out over the course of
00:48:31 November. And so, like, I'm looking at it like, that's five videos that are already written. All
00:48:40 I have to do is voice them, and then the rest of it's DeVu, you know, like, I mean, there's a few
00:48:44 that I have to make some more notes for. But basically, I can have all my work for November
00:48:49 done as soon as these are all voiced. So two days ago, I just sat in my closet and voiced all five
00:48:54 scripts one after another for like, probably two and a half hours or something, and just sat in
00:48:59 the closet, voiced every single one of them, then I came out of the closet, and I edited all of them.
00:49:07 And so, you know, editing audio is not horribly difficult or time consuming, it's just kind of
00:49:14 a grind, because it's just remove all the spaces and bad takes, and then add in new spaces anywhere
00:49:20 that there's not enough space between words, which basically means listen to the same 15-minute
00:49:26 script like three times in the process of editing it to sound coherent. It's kind of boring, especially
00:49:34 to do on five videos at once. So had a few beers, made it easier, you know, by the time I was done,
00:49:40 I was feeling pretty drunk, and was ready to pass out, great day of productivity. That's now five
00:49:46 videos that I have done my whole part for, and so the entire month of November, if I really wanted to,
00:49:52 I could fucking sleep, you know, but of course, because all I like to do is work, I'm already
00:49:58 started on the next big project that'll probably start coming out in December, and I've, you know,
00:50:03 I'm planning all these other things that I want to do, we've got planning for the plebe and the
00:50:07 weave to worry about, we're trying to figure out the situation with getting Jesse and Nate down here,
00:50:12 I've been guesting on podcasts, putting together my own podcast like this one, my own vlogs, I have
00:50:16 a bunch of, I have like five vlog series, five vlog videos that are like halfway done, or even less,
00:50:23 like okay, I started up all these new vlog series that are related to like watching a show, there's
00:50:30 like the second chances board, and what happened with that was I, you know, I selected the next show,
00:50:39 I watched the first episode while I was drunk, and it was, it was kind of too difficult
00:50:45 to comprehend, like there's too much going on for my drunk mind to process, so I decided to
00:50:49 wait till I was sober to watch any more of it, and I just haven't gotten around to it, because I'm
00:50:53 not that, like, I didn't want to drop the show based on that first episode, but I'm also not excited
00:50:58 to watch more of it, and I probably will drop it before the end, but like, I don't know, and then
00:51:04 there was the, the exact same story with random ass recommendations, I shot the dart at the screen,
00:51:11 got the next show, watched the first episode of it, and like, I didn't dislike it, but I also
00:51:17 wasn't so enthusiastic about continuing that I would watch the rest immediately, then I started up
00:51:23 another thing that I won't describe too much, which is another Select a Show thing, I selected
00:51:29 a show, watched the first four episodes, really loved them, but got busy with other stuff, and
00:51:33 haven't gotten around to watching the rest of the show, which is horribly ironic, considering the
00:51:37 nature of this particular show, which you'll see eventually, and then, and then there's also
00:51:46 Finish or Fail for 2016 shows, which of course, the entire fucking summer season ended, so now
00:51:53 there's like 30 fucking shows that I had on hold that I now have to try to watch, so all of that
00:52:00 is waiting, and in the meantime, I'm working on this other huge series that I just, you know,
00:52:05 got excited about and launched right into, so there's just too many have finished and unfinished
00:52:12 projects going on, I have to edit this commentary for the for the for the Patreon before like tomorrow,
00:52:27 and meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna start promoting the PCP guys, because like,
00:52:33 I'm trying to get all everyone on the PCP more popular and more famous, because all of us are
00:52:39 trying to do this as careers, and I'm the only one other than Jeff, who's like really succeeding at
00:52:45 it right now, Jesse is too, but like Jesse has a lot of stuff that's siphoning his money away,
00:52:50 other than just the fact that he spends it haphazardly, but like, we want to get Jesse and
00:52:56 Nate living down here, and Hippo eventually, and we want everybody to be like, satisfyingly able to
00:53:01 make careers off their arc, and so I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna help promote these guys,
00:53:06 how I'm gonna like, you know, help them to find content that they can produce that'll
00:53:12 that'll make it easier to have a career doing this stuff, you know, that's that's kind of the
00:53:17 the thing we're all chasing is to have everybody as a group be able to, you know, sustain ourselves
00:53:24 off of this shit, and right now my my Patreon, I'm actually kind of, I wouldn't say I'm like
00:53:32 losing money or anything, but my Patreon is like kind of just floating around a number that it's
00:53:37 just kind of stable at, and I'm not gaining a ton of views on my new videos because I've chosen to
00:53:42 work on stuff that's not topical and not like big stat cow stuff, which I mean is deliberate,
00:53:49 I just want to do what I want to do, but you know, there's a reason I do those stat cow videos
00:53:55 sometimes, it's because I want the growth that comes with it, and that's not coming right now
00:54:00 because I'm doing weird shit like Akiyuki Shinbo in the 90s and stuff like that, that and plebe in
00:54:05 the weave, that's not going to draw the numbers the way that a, you know, clickbaity title on a
00:54:11 current show is going to do. So point being, I've got all this stuff going on, vices are a great way
00:54:25 to help me through it, all I want to do is do all these vlogging projects, all these
00:54:30 podcasts, all these fucking videos from my main channel, all these huge research projects that
00:54:35 I keep getting myself into, and the project, it really is reaching the point, I'm reaching the
00:54:39 promised point, I used to always say that like if I hit this amount on Patreon, I'll be able to do
00:54:45 bigger and bigger projects, I kept saying that like guys, if you get me up to a thousand dollars of
00:54:50 video, and I only need to make two videos a month, and those videos can be as big as I want them to
00:54:55 be, they can be these huge weeks long research projects that are just like, you know, deep and
00:55:00 involving, and that's exactly what I'm now doing. Stuff like Shinbo in the 90s, you know, is a project
00:55:07 where it just takes that long to watch all those shows and do all that research for it, and it's,
00:55:13 I'm so glad, like this is what I've always wanted to be doing, is these huge projects, and now that's
00:55:20 exactly where things are going, but um, but in the meantime, it's like, I just want to have a couple
00:55:27 of beers, a couple of cigarettes, and eat whatever I want, because eating makes me happy, eating things
00:55:34 I like makes me happy, eating things I don't like doesn't make me happy, you know, like eating healthier
00:55:40 food, you do get that sense of like, wow, I feel physically better, but there's no satisfaction
00:55:46 in it, there's no sense of reward, there's no sense of like, I just worked for three hours,
00:55:52 and I want something to take the edge off, you know, when you just eat something that's just
00:55:56 good for you, it just feels like, well, I am now sustaining myself, like, yes, I can now continue
00:56:02 to live, I guess I'm not hungry anymore, but there's no sense of like, yeah, all right, I did something,
00:56:08 now back to work, at least not for me, I know it's different for some people, the DeVoo has been on a
00:56:13 big health food kick, and it's really working out for him, but for me, I take so much satisfaction
00:56:18 from eating, it's such a huge thing, you know, it's a huge element of what I like, and from drinking,
00:56:24 and from smoking, which I'm gonna try to cut out the smoking, because that's gotten out of hand,
00:56:31 vaping only made it worse, and I've been smoking too many cigarettes, but only because I was like
00:56:40 experimenting with different types, because I bought a pack of blacks, which is a clove cigarette
00:56:46 that I've always wanted to try, I mean, I've tried one before, but I've always wanted to try and buy
00:56:50 one, and I like, hunted them down and bought a pack, and that was pretty cool, but those things take
00:56:55 too long to smoke, and you know, by the end of it, I've got a headache, so went through that pack,
00:57:02 then this is kind of its own story, but I was watching The Dick Show, which if you're a patron
00:57:10 of The Dick Show, you get to see video feeds of the episodes, and Asterios Cocanos, who is a
00:57:16 fantastic comedian who I love, was finally on the show after a long period of trying to get him on
00:57:21 there, and it was a fucking great show, and Asterios was just smoking cigarettes constantly through
00:57:26 the whole show, and it was really funny, and I am extremely suggestible, so when I saw him smoking,
00:57:31 I immediately wanted some, and what he was smoking was a cigarette brand called Dunhills,
00:57:35 which had this really interesting package, and I was like, okay, I want to try those, so I hunted
00:57:39 them down, and now I'm smoking a pack at Dunhills, but once that's over, I will hopefully stop
00:57:45 for at least a little while, because I've been burning through this pack at a rate that is
00:57:50 completely beyond anything I've ever been doing before, so it's not a good look in terms of getting
00:57:58 addicted, but you know, cigarettes notwithstanding, I do love drinking, which I am good at doing in
00:58:06 moderation, I've never gotten to the point of alcoholism or any kind of addiction with that,
00:58:11 it's purely a casual thing, cigarettes, it's starting to feel very not casual, which is why
00:58:16 I'm worried about it, but yeah, that stuff just gets me through, man, that's what makes it so
00:58:26 five days of nonstop work doesn't feel exhausting, I don't feel like, oh my god, I haven't done
00:58:35 anything, I feel like wow, I've accomplished so much, and I've felt good the whole time, and all of
00:58:41 it's possible because of the lifting, because the lifting is so satisfying, and so like, physically
00:58:49 engaging, and it makes me feel so like good afterwards, like my body feels good, and I look
00:58:55 at myself in the mirror, and I feel good, because I see this like, I see the confidence running
00:59:00 through me, I see my body slowly becoming more, you know, like able to stand upright, and you know,
00:59:08 and have a posture to it, that it's like, yeah, I don't even care if I'm fat, because who do I
00:59:15 need to be skinny for, I don't know, I don't care, I'm not even like, it's not like if I like lost
00:59:22 a bunch of weight, and got like really good looking, that I would suddenly go out on the town, and start
00:59:27 like, hooking up with girls or something, like that's not gonna happen, you know, even if I
00:59:32 completely lost weight, and I look fantastic and beautiful, it's still gonna be me sitting around
00:59:38 on the computer, editing your, you know, writing videos for days on end, so it's like, as long as
00:59:43 I feel good, it doesn't matter what I look like, I just want to feel good physically, and what makes
00:59:50 me feel good physically is pumping fucking iron, and feeling strong, you know, and as long as I feel
00:59:56 strong, no amount of eating makes me feel completely gross, no amount of drinking makes me feel
01:00:02 completely gross, and so I'm just totally indulging, I am completely breaking bad, and going off the
01:00:10 deep end, and it feels great, and I don't know if I recommend that to anybody else, if that would
01:00:18 work with anyone else's lifestyle, but um, yeah, I just physically feel, for the last like two and
01:00:27 a half weeks, I felt great, and I mentioned at the start of the last Digi Bro's decompression
01:00:33 chamber, I was like, you know, even though I need to decompress just because there's too much going
01:00:37 on, I feel good, like I don't feel bad at all, everything in my life feels really great right
01:00:43 now, and that's entirely because of the lifting, the strictly regimented lifting just every other day,
01:00:50 me and Ben lift, you know, and then I feel, I feel incrementally stronger, I feel confident,
01:00:56 and I can just eat whatever I want, and not give a single fuck about anything, and I have been
01:01:03 picking out on a scale that I have never done before, and uh, and probably spending too much
01:01:10 money, but I mean, I don't really spend money on anything else, so my budget is so hard to exhaust,
01:01:17 because it like, it like, the amount I spend on food looks like too much, but then there's nothing
01:01:22 else taking it away, so I always look at my bank, and there's still money there, and I'm like, well,
01:01:26 as long as there's still money there, I guess it doesn't matter, but we'll see, we'll see what happens
01:01:33 when tax day comes, and it all comes crashing down around me, and I have to fucking make an LLC,
01:01:39 and I gotta fucking register DeVue probably as an employee, because I'm sure he's made
01:01:44 ten grand this year, uh, uh, I don't want to do any of that, I need to, I looked up the rates for
01:01:53 hiring an accountant, they were too high, uh, I gotta figure out how to do it all myself,
01:02:02 no money, no problems,
01:02:04 all right, this is either the end of this episode, or there's gonna be another segment that I record
01:02:10 tomorrow before I post this, so look forward to that, and uh, see you then. You know, all week long,
01:02:17 I had fully intended on finishing and editing and uploading this thing on the 30th, and the 30th came
01:02:24 around, sat around all day, kept thinking I was gonna do it, but putting it, putting it off for
01:02:29 this reason or another, and now it's already the next day, but I wanted to talk a little bit about
01:02:34 why this is on the PCP channel, because some people were saying that this seems like a very
01:02:39 after-dark kind of, uh, kind of show, and I get where they're coming from, the explanation is
01:02:46 something that I think anyone will understand who's an artist, and probably a lot of other people
01:02:51 will too, which is just basically about the different ways that you compartmentalize
01:02:57 your thoughts, and your works, and just what you do, and there's sort of the reason that I have so
01:03:05 many channels, and I think this applies to everyone I know who has multiple channels,
01:03:09 is that each one has a very distinctive voice and purpose. You know, some people,
01:03:16 back in the day, we started up multiple channels because we thought, well, you know,
01:03:20 this channel's for anime, this one will be for this, this one will be for that, but uh,
01:03:25 over time it's come to be more of like the character of the content that's on it, so
01:03:31 my main channel is meant specifically for like, you know, highly edited videos that have a concrete
01:03:39 point, but it's not just that, it's also that they're kind of individual, like each one,
01:03:46 while I do expect that people, you know, watch more than one video on the channel that they want
01:03:51 to fully get, like, where I'm coming from with my videos, because I think there's a sort of
01:03:54 ongoing narrative of the way I talk about shows, um, I don't expect that people who watch the channel
01:04:02 will know me that well. I don't expect them to know, like, everything I've ever done, I don't
01:04:07 expect them to know who I know, who I talk to, you know, uh, so if I make a video on the main
01:04:12 channel where I'm just openly making reference to, like, the PCP, or to any of my friends, or to,
01:04:19 like, more personal aspects that I don't expect most of those people to have heard of, or like,
01:04:23 to get where I'm coming from, then I think it would, it would be weird, you know, so it's like,
01:04:28 each, each video on there is more about, here's a subject I'm dissecting, and you can go from
01:04:35 this video to any of the others, and it'll, it'll continually make sense, it's that kind of body
01:04:40 of work, whereas on other channels, like After Dark, I have more of an expectation that if you're
01:04:46 watching After Dark, it's because you're invested in me, not so much that you're invested in anime,
01:04:51 or in analysis, per se, you're just invested in what's DigiBro up to, and that channel is intentionally
01:04:57 random, it's just whatever comes to mind is up there, it could be a vlog, it could be a music
01:05:03 video, it could be anything, you know, I don't market it in such a way that, uh, that I expect
01:05:09 people to, you know, subscribe for one kind of content. Now I know that, I mean, that's not,
01:05:17 in terms of marketability, it's probably a terrible idea, I mean, there's lots of stuff on After Dark
01:05:22 that if the channel was just that, it would probably get bigger, and if I, you know, if I
01:05:27 changed the thumbnails and stuff to be more accessible, but I don't want it to be that,
01:05:32 it's meant to be just anything goes, uh, take it or leave it, you know, it's the DigiBro experience.
01:05:41 Now, the PCP channel, though, is a little bit different, because PCP channel is about regularity,
01:05:48 it's about shows that come out on something resembling a schedule, you know, each show is a
01:05:53 once a week schedule, with the exception of some of the specials that we do, like, you know, the
01:05:58 draw cast or rowdy fuckers cop killers, but even those are a series, there's a definitive style
01:06:04 to it, there's not a lot of videos on this channel that are just totally out of nowhere,
01:06:09 there's the 360 classroom, which we do intend to do more of, so that's a series as well,
01:06:14 and the Great Dark Souls race is probably like the most, just like, this is just a thing we did
01:06:19 with all of us in it, um, kind of thing, but like, the idea of the channel is weekly shows that are
01:06:27 usually pretty long, they're always like at least an hour, they're mostly podcasts, there's not a lot
01:06:32 of visual element to this channel, um, and when there is, another part of it is that it's, it's
01:06:39 all of us, and even if we're not all in the video, or even if it's a one person podcast, you know,
01:06:46 there's still a lot of reference being made to the PCP, to other people involved, and so,
01:06:51 so, you know, I think for that reason, this show kind of belongs here, where if I, if I constantly
01:06:58 talk about my online friends on Digibro After Dark, I don't know that all of my audience knows or
01:07:05 cares about them, you know, like, if you're watching the PCP channel, it means that you know who all
01:07:11 of us are, probably, as opposed to on After Dark, which has its own distinct audience that's about
01:07:18 me, so, yeah, I agree that this is the kind of content you would kind of expect from Digibro After
01:07:25 Dark, but it's very formulated, and I wanted it to be that way, it's a weekly show-ish, it's, uh,
01:07:32 you know, it's got this certain visual presentation, the certain style of audio, it's got music,
01:07:37 which is unusual for my content, you know, so, yeah, that's why I think it's more of a
01:07:44 procrastinator's channel show, and we wanted, uh, Jesse especially wants each of us to have
01:07:49 our own show, or for each combination of us to have our own show, so like, we'd love it for the PCP
01:07:53 channel to be like a bunch of different podcasts, uh, each of which have their own formula, their
01:08:00 own regular intervals of output, and uh, yeah, I think that's cool, and it's kind of, in a way,
01:08:06 it's a lot like the Red Letter Media way of doing things, you know, where their channel is like,
01:08:11 there's the best of the worst, there's half in the bag, there's review, and they're all
01:08:16 sort of different, different takes on the same concept of two guys sit down and talk about
01:08:23 a movie, um, in a way, The Plebe and the Weave would have been a good fit for this channel too,
01:08:28 but that show is, um, just, we wanted it to be big, like, I wanted to see how big of a deal
01:08:35 The Plebe and the Weave could get to be, so that's why we put it on my main channel,
01:08:38 because I have the most subs out of everybody's channel, so, you know, I didn't want it to sort
01:08:42 of languish in obscurity on something like the PCP channel, which is growing, but not huge,
01:08:49 you know, at this point, but yeah, um, that's why it's here, and I think it's, I think it's good
01:08:58 for it to be here, I like it being here, and I like the idea of the podcast in general.
01:09:04 By the way, I thought I'd mention, if you guys haven't been listening to Jesse's panel cast,
01:09:12 you should be, because it's great, um, so far, it's two for two on getting me to read a comic
01:09:19 that, uh, that I would have never heard of, or ever read, and both of them I loved. I liked
01:09:26 Gwenpool last week, and this week I read All of the Vision, which is actually a complete run,
01:09:31 it's 12 issues, and it's finished, and it was, it was great, um, once again, I went out to try and
01:09:38 buy it, but they didn't have it at Barnes and Noble, so, um, one day I'll read a comic that
01:09:43 is available, but yeah, uh, it's a good time, you should read that comic, and you should listen to
01:09:48 the panel cast, and I guess that's about it. I don't, I don't want to talk too much on this
01:09:54 podcast about the specifics of, like, what I've been up to, because usually those are things
01:10:03 that will be represented in a video. It was one thing to talk about, like, the spreadsheets and
01:10:07 stuff before, because that's an element of my work that doesn't actually appear on camera,
01:10:12 but like, I've been watching, uh, Tsukuyomi Moonphase for the last few days, and it's like,
01:10:17 everything I have to say about it, it's gonna be in the, the video about it, you know, and about
01:10:23 Shinbo, though I guess what I could talk about is the fact that because the show is pretty boring,
01:10:28 and I kind of lost interest in it about eight episodes in, I've just had it on on my second
01:10:33 monitor, and I've been like, really struggling to pay enough attention to it, you know, to, to get
01:10:39 what I need, because I'm just watching it for research, I, I don't care about the story at all,
01:10:44 and it has elements that I really, really like, the character designs are incredible, um, there's
01:10:49 just great facial expressions, a lot of the characters are likable, and the show is good
01:10:53 when it's just like a light-hearted, fun comedy, but it, it's rarely that, it's usually this really
01:11:00 boring, plot-driven show where the story is fucking generic and garbage, uh, so that's what
01:11:07 I've been struggling through, just smoked the last cigarette that I had in my pack, and I'm gonna
01:11:12 quit now, um, because that's getting to be a dangerous hobby, so getting out of that,
01:11:23 it's Halloween today, I've got a video coming out, kind of regret that I didn't, um, I meant to post a
01:11:30 like, a Patreon post of three months worth of vlogs and unpatron videos, I still might,
01:11:36 I always feel bad when I load multiple Patreon posts into the very end of the month, because I
01:11:42 feel like, you know, it suddenly hits people with multiple things to pay for right at the very end,
01:11:48 um, which feels like a transparent money grab, but it just so happens that because,
01:11:54 you know, we get paid by the month, we always have a plan to like, this video has to be out on
01:11:59 this week, this one on this week, and this one by the end of the month, and so like, you know,
01:12:04 I both want to post this like, hey, here's three months of, uh, three months of content that hadn't
01:12:10 been patroned yet, and then also this new video, and part of the reason that I don't want to do it,
01:12:16 um, like, I don't want to do my post first, because I pay DeVoo 40% of whatever I make on Patreon,
01:12:26 uh, for the videos that he edits, so anytime I make a Patreon post for something that wasn't edited
01:12:32 by the DeVoo, and you know, with each post you make exponentially less money, like, the first of the
01:12:37 month is where I make what it actually says on Patreon, and then each one after that is way, way
01:12:42 less, because most people have a monthly cap on how much they'll pay, so, you know, each video is
01:12:48 basically worth more the earlier into the month it's posted, and so if I post up like, um, you know,
01:12:58 my, just like, here's three months worth of vlogs that never got patroned, then that will make more
01:13:04 than the video that DeVoo's editing, and that means that DeVoo gets paid a smaller amount,
01:13:09 than he would, uh, you know, if his video came out before my post, so, you know, I know DeVoo needs
01:13:17 the money right now, so I'm kind of hoping his video comes out first, I mean, I could just pay
01:13:22 him 40% of the other one instead, but yeah, because of all that, I was hesitating on posting it,
01:13:29 but now it's the last day of the month, so if I post both on the very last day, then it, I don't
01:13:34 know, it feels weird to me, I don't know if it feels weird to the audience, no one's ever complained
01:13:38 about me doing it that way, no one ever complains that, like, at the very end of every month is when
01:13:43 a ton more content comes out than normal, you know, like, when we had Kurokono Basket and
01:13:49 Mob Psycho in, like, the same day, and then also at the end of the month is when the commentaries
01:13:53 come out, so there's like a four-hour commentary, and then, like, you know, all this other stuff,
01:13:59 I don't know if people treat that more as like a wow, I'm getting so much content all at once,
01:14:04 or if it's like a wow, you've completely, you know, charged me all this shit I wasn't expecting
01:14:10 right at the end of the month, but, I mean, everyone has their monthly limit set in place, so,
01:14:15 you know, as long as, as long as you have that monthly limit, then you know, you know what
01:14:22 you're in for with how much can be spent by you by the end of the month, I don't know, Patreon's
01:14:26 weird. I'm thinking about doing some kind of really long vlog, or maybe even podcast about
01:14:32 the weird nature of living in a world where people fund you, and the nature of the cult of
01:14:40 personality that's forming, and how I get scared for people sometimes when they have to start up
01:14:47 a Patreon or something, especially if they're starting it on the back of something controversial,
01:14:52 because you kind of become like someone who's not just doing your job, but who's trying to
01:15:00 convince people that you are worth spending money on, you know, and a lot more of like
01:15:05 stuff that's not connected directly to your work becomes a part of it, where like, you know,
01:15:11 if I said something that deeply offended a contingent of my audience, or I got involved in some kind
01:15:16 of drama, then that could affect my, you know, like my Patreon, whereas, I mean, that would happen
01:15:23 with other stuff, and that's partly also what I'd want to get into into this podcast. In fact,
01:15:27 I should just stop talking about this now, because I'm gonna have a whole thing about it. It's an
01:15:31 interesting sort of conundrum, and I've been in a unique position to observe it as an early adopter
01:15:39 of Patreon, who's been using it for God, three years? Holy shit, that's a lot. Well, yeah,
01:15:47 that's about it for this episode. I just wanted to do one last segment before, before wrapping it up.
01:15:56 So, I'll see you next week, and have a good time. Have a nice night, and listen to this soothing music.
