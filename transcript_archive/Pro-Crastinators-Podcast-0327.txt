00:00:00 I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:03 That son of a bitch.
00:00:04 Son of a bitch.
00:00:05 Son of a bitch.
00:00:06 Son of a bitch.
00:00:07 Son of a bitch.
00:00:08 Son of a bitch.
00:00:09 Son of a bitch.
00:00:10 Son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Hey Ben, you ever seen The Monkey That Hides From Gay People?
00:00:19 No.
00:00:20 Uh, got him.
00:00:22 Got him.
00:00:24 Tricking the block.
00:00:27 I see, I see.
00:00:30 You never heard that bit?
00:00:31 No.
00:00:32 You ever heard like that dick?
00:00:33 No, I've never heard that.
00:00:35 Yeah, I killed him.
00:00:37 The original version is like, have you heard of the clown that hides from gay people?
00:00:42 And the whole idea is you tell that to a young boy and he's like, he hears the word gay and
00:00:46 he's like, I don't want them to think I'm gay so he rushes to say no.
00:00:49 I mean.
00:00:50 And not realizing that he only hides from gay people.
00:00:53 I mean, he wouldn't, but he's telling the truth because he wouldn't have seen him.
00:00:58 Because there is no such clown.
00:01:00 Well, he's probably gay then.
00:01:02 Yeah, if you haven't seen him, most likely you're just gay.
00:01:06 I haven't seen him.
00:01:08 Exactly.
00:01:09 I haven't seen him either, to be honest.
00:01:11 What if you're bi?
00:01:12 I've been looking.
00:01:13 What if you're bi?
00:01:14 Does he sort of...
00:01:16 You see like half of the clown?
00:01:19 He's like, he's like bleeding out on the ground.
00:01:22 Look at him.
00:01:23 He's screaming.
00:01:25 He's screaming.
00:01:26 He got Harry Potter teleportation fucked up, split in half.
00:01:30 Yeah.
00:01:31 He got bi-sected.
00:01:32 He tried to transition.
00:01:34 He tried to transition using Harry Potter magic, but it triggered the kill.
00:01:38 It was the slice switch.
00:01:40 Yeah.
00:01:41 Rowling built a...
00:01:42 Built a kill, a kill, a safeguard into her spells.
00:01:46 And if anyone tries to transition genderly using Harry Potter magic, it'll activate the
00:01:53 kill switch.
00:01:54 It kills them instantly.
00:01:55 Kills them instantly.
00:01:56 Please shut the fuck up.
00:01:57 All the wands are transphobic.
00:02:00 So if you're a different gender than when the wands chose you, it just blows up in your
00:02:04 face.
00:02:05 You know, it never says it in the books, but actually, which is actually have wands that
00:02:11 are shaped like vaginas?
00:02:15 Whereas only male wizards use the dick shaped wands that are long and phallic.
00:02:20 It never says otherwise.
00:02:23 You can't prove that it doesn't say that in the book.
00:02:26 Like a police badge?
00:02:27 Like they hold it up?
00:02:30 The vagina-shaped wooden thing?
00:02:33 I guess.
00:02:34 Yeah, I guess.
00:02:35 Yeah, sure.
00:02:36 Or maybe it's like a...
00:02:37 Like a Jackie Chan Adventures talisman.
00:02:40 Yeah.
00:02:41 Yeah, it's a talisman.
00:02:43 Yes.
00:02:44 It never says...
00:02:46 Show me where in the books it says that Hermione's wand is long and stick-like.
00:02:51 It doesn't.
00:02:52 It never says...
00:02:53 Just like it never says that she isn't...
00:02:54 It never says that she's white, except for that one time, but it mostly doesn't, so...
00:03:01 It never says Harry Potter's white either.
00:03:03 That's right, except for probably a bunch of times.
00:03:06 You know, it never says Voldemort...
00:03:07 Describes you to his pale.
00:03:08 It never says Voldemort's white.
00:03:10 No.
00:03:11 No?
00:03:12 Definitely.
00:03:13 It's Voldemort.
00:03:14 Harry Potter was pretty problematic.
00:03:16 He canceled that BIPOC villain, BIPOC dictator eugenicist.
00:03:22 They canceled...
00:03:25 They tried to kill that one guy who was trying to prevent the Holocaust, but that's...
00:03:29 Yeah.
00:03:30 Because preventing the Holocaust is just as evil as...
00:03:32 Johnny Depp is...
00:03:33 Is Johnny Depp white?
00:03:34 Yeah, he's white.
00:03:36 He just larps as British.
00:03:38 He's so tan.
00:03:40 He's so tan, though.
00:03:41 Yeah, that's how he gets you.
00:03:43 You ever seen the original Nightmare on Elm Street?
00:03:49 He's like pale in that movie.
00:03:51 Johnny Depp was in the original Nightmare on Elm Street?
00:03:54 Yeah, oh yeah, he is.
00:03:55 He fucking...
00:03:56 No, I've never seen that.
00:03:57 He played the Elm.
00:03:58 Yep.
00:03:59 He played him, and I only know this because my partner's a huge Freddy Krueger nut, but
00:04:05 he's the guy who...
00:04:06 Do you remember the death where a guy gets sucked into a bed and then a blood guy shoots
00:04:12 out from the bed?
00:04:13 I have seen that, yeah.
00:04:15 Yeah, that's Johnny Depp's stuff.
00:04:17 What?
00:04:18 Really?
00:04:19 Wow.
00:04:20 Yeah, really.
00:04:21 Then he comes back for the sixth film for a quick joke where a guy is watching TV, and
00:04:26 then Johnny Depp shows up as his character from the first movie, and they're doing a whole
00:04:30 bit about, like, this is your brain on drugs, and then Freddy hits his face with a frying
00:04:35 pan, and he's like, that's your brain.
00:04:36 I don't know what drugs you're on.
00:04:39 Right.
00:04:40 Yeah, I know.
00:04:41 Yeah.
00:04:42 I know my Freddy Krueger, Lauren.
00:04:43 I'll buy a choice, because I just live with someone who's always talking about it.
00:04:49 I see, I see.
00:04:51 I've never watched an entire Nightmare on Elm Street.
00:04:54 Oh, you should.
00:04:55 It's kind of like your life story.
00:04:57 Oh, really?
00:04:58 Oh, it happens when you're awake.
00:05:00 The life of Freddy Krueger?
00:05:02 Are you saying that I'm Freddy?
00:05:04 Yeah, you're Freddy.
00:05:05 You got burned alive when you came back.
00:05:09 Yeah.
00:05:10 You got burned on Twitter alive when you came back.
00:05:15 Sounds like me.
00:05:16 You got ratioed on Twitter.
00:05:18 It's pretty much the same, yeah.
00:05:20 Yeah, well, a heart attack, and then Dream Demon showed up and said, Ben, say, you're
00:05:24 the angriest man on Twitter.
00:05:26 We're going to bring you back, and if you ratio someone on Twitter, they die in real life.
00:05:32 That tracks with my experience, yeah.
00:05:37 I've got a, my friggin, my friggin microphone is in a weird position because I am in a new
00:05:43 house now, and my freaking microphone stand does not stick to my desk because it just
00:05:52 doesn't have the lip on it for it to clamp onto.
00:05:55 So, I had to put my mic, clamp it onto my side table and move my side table next to
00:06:01 my desk, and now it's kind of awkwardly sort of sticking up over the side of the table
00:06:05 and leaning over in front of me, and I have to sort of turn two different ways to speak
00:06:12 into the mic versus not speak into the, to look at my screen, I have to look this way,
00:06:16 and then to speak into the mic, I have to turn this way.
00:06:19 It's bugging me.
00:06:20 It's bugging me, yeah.
00:06:21 It's like I'm there.
00:06:22 You hear the difference perhaps.
00:06:24 I'm there, like, crouching with my ear, pressed up against your mouth, hearing everything.
00:06:29 This is a 4D podcast.
00:06:32 You smell a vision.
00:06:34 You can smell Ben St.
00:06:36 You can smell Ben St. through the microphone if you're leaning real close.
00:06:40 Just rub your screen that you're listening to on the phone or a desktop, and you can
00:06:46 smell Ben St. with future air coming out of your screen.
00:06:50 I'm breathing directly into your ear.
00:06:54 We've got to make sure Ben St. stops breathing.
00:06:58 Can you smell the, can you smell last night's pepperoni?
00:07:02 For every, for every $5, for every $5 you sent to Trixie's Patreon, Ben will breathe
00:07:09 one second less.
00:07:11 Let's crack up that numbers.
00:07:13 Boys, let's go.
00:07:15 It's a great, it's a red letter week for me.
00:07:17 I moved to a new house that isn't a disgusting whole.
00:07:20 I live in a real room now.
00:07:22 I feel great.
00:07:23 And also Trixie is dead and I killed her.
00:07:25 Oh, she retired, yeah.
00:07:27 She's dead.
00:07:28 Ben St. has taken another trans woman's job.
00:07:31 Excellent.
00:07:32 I mean, job.
00:07:34 I mean, job.
00:07:36 Oh, quote on quote, yeah.
00:07:38 Yeah.
00:07:39 It's, it's crazy.
00:07:40 Most retirements imply you have like enough money to live comfortably.
00:07:44 Most retirements, usually a retirement is from something.
00:07:48 Right, yeah.
00:07:49 Somebody, somebody, somebody posted, oh, somebody posted on Twitter a, just a gif of a Seinfeld
00:07:56 where Kramer says like, I'm retiring and Jerry says from what?
00:08:00 Yeah.
00:08:02 Got him.
00:08:04 That was good.
00:08:05 And then Kramer says like, you know what?
00:08:07 Fuck you, Jerry.
00:08:08 Okay.
00:08:09 You know what, Jerry?
00:08:10 Fuck you.
00:08:11 I'm, I'm bi-bogging.
00:08:12 You can't talk to me that way.
00:08:15 I was, I was trying to quote that there's this one like edited, there's like this one
00:08:20 audio where it's, it's like the clip from SpongeBob where it's where the word is like taking
00:08:24 some guy's order and he's like being sarcastic the whole time.
00:08:27 And then someone like adds audio of the fish guy saying like, you know what?
00:08:31 Fuck you, Squidward.
00:08:32 And then he goes on like a two minute, like Mr. Anter style like rant of like, is it nice
00:08:38 and like, and like SpongeBob is.
00:08:40 And there was like so many people saying like, oh my God, this is so like, like funny.
00:08:44 And I'm thinking like, no, this sucks.
00:08:46 This is fucking cringe.
00:08:48 I could imagine it being funny.
00:08:50 I mean, was it supposed to be sincere?
00:08:52 Like a sincere like takedown of the character of Squidward?
00:08:56 No, nobody, nobody talks about this, but actually Squidward is very, he's a very mean
00:09:01 guy actually.
00:09:02 I think that's actually a pretty unpleasant individual when you, when you think about it.
00:09:05 You know, no one, I don't think I've seen anyone really point this out, but Squidward,
00:09:10 not, not a good person.
00:09:11 Not a good person.
00:09:12 I can see why he's not preferred among the townspeople in Bikini Bottom.
00:09:17 Actually, when you think about it, Mr. Burns actually is a pretty, is a pretty bad dude.
00:09:22 He actually does bad things with his money.
00:09:25 He does not, yeah, does not help the people of Springfield very much.
00:09:29 Very morally questionable.
00:09:31 He's very, well, you know, he's, he's, he's, he's a, he's morally complex.
00:09:34 He's gray.
00:09:35 He's morally gray.
00:09:36 He's complicated.
00:09:37 So we stan.
00:09:38 I, I, I hate that.
00:09:40 I hate audio.
00:09:41 Cause I know Squidward would just interrupt and say like, all right, all right, all right.
00:09:45 Yeah.
00:09:46 I think I listened to a bit of it.
00:09:49 And it was just sort of like, I don't know.
00:09:52 Would you like some wine with that cheese on that Krabby Patty?
00:09:56 Yeah.
00:09:57 It's like giving a platform to this fish, but like he's just, the bit goes on too long.
00:10:02 Like we get it.
00:10:03 He, that, that was rude, sir.
00:10:06 I mean, I was like, he doesn't need to go on like a family guy bit about it.
00:10:10 Yes.
00:10:11 Oh my God.
00:10:12 Yeah.
00:10:13 I was going to compare it to that one speech.
00:10:14 Quagmire.
00:10:15 Quagmire.
00:10:16 That's what I was thinking.
00:10:17 Is it like that?
00:10:18 Cause that's genuine.
00:10:19 That I was thinking.
00:10:20 Yeah.
00:10:21 That, that speech is also very like, does it really like, I think they were trying to
00:10:26 illustrate that like, even someone as bad as Quagmire, this is like Brian, but it's like,
00:10:31 Quagmire is like a rapist and implied to have an incest.
00:10:34 Sometimes he is.
00:10:35 Yeah.
00:10:36 So it's like.
00:10:37 He is.
00:10:38 Yeah.
00:10:39 You know, sometimes it's okay when a rapist lecturers, sometimes it's okay.
00:10:42 Yeah.
00:10:43 Yeah.
00:10:44 It's a little weird.
00:10:45 I mean, I think they did that because I think there probably was a lot of the audience that
00:10:49 didn't get that they were going for that, for like a, a douchebag with Brian and I mean,
00:10:55 I guess it's sort of their fault for not making it clear enough before it's their, it's their
00:10:59 fault that they had to, that they felt the need to clarify.
00:11:02 Like you're actually not really supposed to agree with Brian about stuff.
00:11:06 You know.
00:11:07 All the time, except sometimes, except sometimes you definitely are though.
00:11:10 So.
00:11:11 You know, I just realized now that stuff, stuff like Barlin has played two different animal
00:11:16 characters that are like pure white.
00:11:19 The other one, the bear.
00:11:21 No, he doesn't play the bear.
00:11:22 Well, he doesn't.
00:11:23 Yeah, he might.
00:11:24 Yeah.
00:11:25 Yeah.
00:11:26 Oh, wait, wait, wait, he plays it.
00:11:28 Oh my God.
00:11:29 Oh, if I just fucking realize another character that's like pure white that he plays.
00:11:32 So he plays Brian, who's white.
00:11:34 And then he plays like the, the rat, the rat from the animated movie sing.
00:11:39 It was also like pure white.
00:11:41 I don't know that one.
00:11:43 You should, you should look a look of rat from sing stuff like Barlin rat from sing.
00:11:49 And he's like, you're saying, sing is an animated movie about like singing animals and
00:11:54 like a contest.
00:11:55 I've never seen that, but it sort of looked.
00:11:59 Oh, yes.
00:12:00 Yes.
00:12:01 What was the other thing like the pets thing?
00:12:04 It was just like a secret life of secret life of pets.
00:12:07 I thought he wasn't in that.
00:12:09 He wasn't in that one.
00:12:11 They came out the same year.
00:12:12 I think those movies, the singing for a life of pets.
00:12:17 So, so that's two characters, but the secret third white character that Seth McFarlane plays
00:12:22 is he plays himself.
00:12:24 I forget the name.
00:12:25 I forget the name of the character.
00:12:27 He's the white cartoon character.
00:12:29 He's in, he's in Hellboy two and he plays that one German ghost guy who's in the scuba
00:12:35 diver suit.
00:12:36 He's like a pure white ghost.
00:12:38 Really?
00:12:39 Yeah.
00:12:40 He's like a big house.
00:12:41 Yeah.
00:12:42 Hellboy.
00:12:43 Seth McFarlane, Hellboy two.
00:12:45 Did you not know Ron Prover played Hellboy?
00:12:48 I forgot, but not that I think about it.
00:12:50 Not that I think about it.
00:12:51 That makes perfect sense.
00:12:53 Man, I'm looking at, man, this Doug Jones guy is a really weird looking dude.
00:12:58 I guess that's why they picked him to play a fucked up fish.
00:13:01 Oh, yeah.
00:13:02 He only plays, he only plays like characters that are like coated in like three layers of
00:13:08 special effects makeup.
00:13:09 That's like his gimmick.
00:13:11 He's weird looking in real life.
00:13:13 He has like, he's also super skinny.
00:13:15 So like he's perfect for those roles because he could just keep stacking shit on his face
00:13:20 and it won't look like, it won't look like his head is like massive with all that stuff
00:13:24 on it.
00:13:25 So it looks kind of like normal human proportions.
00:13:28 Yeah.
00:13:29 Cool.
00:13:30 I met him in real life actually.
00:13:32 You met him in real life?
00:13:34 Yeah.
00:13:35 I met him at Comic Con.
00:13:37 He hugged me.
00:13:38 Oh, wow.
00:13:39 And he told me, I have a shirt that said I'm a huge asshole.
00:13:41 I was wearing that to Comic Con.
00:13:43 And he saw that shirt and he told me that like after he hugged me, he's like, yeah,
00:13:47 I promise you got to stop being a huge asshole.
00:13:49 And I'm like, all right, I will.
00:13:51 I've been breaking that promise a lot recently actually.
00:13:55 So he, oh, I see the, I mean, you can't, you can't really see his face at all.
00:14:02 This diver guy.
00:14:03 No, he's like, he's like a phantom something.
00:14:06 He's like a mist inside of his helmet.
00:14:09 And that's him, I guess.
00:14:11 Yeah.
00:14:12 In the comic, he like accidentally becomes mist because he was doing a seance at the wrong
00:14:16 time.
00:14:17 He hated when I do a seance at the wrong time.
00:14:20 He'd become mist.
00:14:22 That face.
00:14:23 No, I'm not right.
00:14:24 POV, you did your seance wrong and now you're mist.
00:14:28 Yeah, he fucking mist.
00:14:30 I think in the comic though, that's like very, it's like a three page origin story basically.
00:14:35 He's doing a seance.
00:14:37 Meanwhile, the other side of the earth, the Chinese are doing like supernatural experiments
00:14:41 at the same time.
00:14:42 And this just kind of like is a, is a string of bad events and he just instantly gets ghost
00:14:48 defied daddy phantom style.
00:14:51 And he, he's like, oh fuck, I'm a mist ghost.
00:14:54 I got to live in this scuba diving suit.
00:14:56 I just found this on Google images.
00:14:58 So I guess I might as well post it.
00:15:00 I don't know.
00:15:03 Hey, it's too, it's a reference.
00:15:05 Hey, it's a reference that I get.
00:15:08 This is, this is so, I was about to say this feels so 20 2008.
00:15:12 And then I look, I'm like, yeah, but I think it's self aware, but it's self aware.
00:15:16 So I mean, it's drawn in, I think it's, I think it's deliberately a penny arcade sort
00:15:22 of looking or CAD looking thing.
00:15:24 Yeah.
00:15:25 Yeah.
00:15:26 Yeah.
00:15:27 It's like, it'd be that era where all the penny arcade.
00:15:29 That's like the time Peter Griffin double in the first hell boy.
00:15:36 Action.
00:15:37 Oh, oh, oh my gosh.
00:15:41 This is awful.
00:15:42 Hello, son of a hellboy.
00:15:44 Remember, you remember that part in Sonichu where they do a cutaway gag to Peter Griffin
00:15:49 joining the ghostbusters, not, not like the Egon and, and, and Venkman ghostbusters,
00:15:57 but the other ghostbusters.
00:15:59 Talk about the one that had the gorilla.
00:16:01 Yes.
00:16:02 Yes.
00:16:03 Yeah.
00:16:04 Yeah.
00:16:05 The one that predates the ghostbusters that everyone actually likes.
00:16:08 Yeah.
00:16:09 Well, it predates the cartoon.
00:16:10 I'm not sure if it predates the movie.
00:16:12 It predates, it does predate the movie.
00:16:14 Oh, okay.
00:16:15 Yeah.
00:16:16 All right.
00:16:17 I've never seen it.
00:16:18 I just am aware of it.
00:16:19 Yeah.
00:16:20 They made that cartoon and then when they were trying to make their own ghostbusters cartoon
00:16:23 based on the Bill Murray movie, they couldn't call it the ghostbusters.
00:16:26 It sounded like a dig.
00:16:27 They called it the real ghostbusters, right?
00:16:29 Yeah, the shit on the original.
00:16:32 Fuck.
00:16:33 That's awesome.
00:16:34 I think more things should do that.
00:16:36 I think they should reboot Steven Universe and call it the real Steven Universe.
00:16:40 No, no, no.
00:16:41 This is somebody else.
00:16:42 Just somebody else makes another completely unrelated show and call it the real Steven
00:16:47 Universe.
00:16:48 And it's just not like a guy living in LA or something.
00:16:53 It's like a white guy.
00:16:54 Yeah.
00:16:55 A white straight guy.
00:16:56 He only thinks that would hetero people.
00:16:59 That's the gimmick.
00:17:01 That's the gimmick.
00:17:02 It's like, what if Steven Universe was straight and then all these like...
00:17:05 What if he was on the straight and narrow and he never met anyone as clear?
00:17:08 Steven Universe was straight.
00:17:09 It's the plot of the real Steven Universe.
00:17:12 Steven Universe was hetero sexual instead of all this gay baby shit he used to do.
00:17:20 It takes place actually after Steven Universe Future.
00:17:24 Steven goes on his little red trip, comes out straight from that.
00:17:27 Comes out straight, starts a business.
00:17:29 What if Lars comes back from his space odyssey and he's like, wow, the space radiation turned
00:17:36 me straight?
00:17:37 Steven, what do I do?
00:17:39 Lars comes back and he's like, I'm transphobic now, Steven.
00:17:42 And Steven's like, yeah, me too, actually.
00:17:45 God.
00:17:47 It's an awesome idea for a cartoon, 10 out of 10.
00:17:51 My new housemates are going to hear me screeching and cackling and think that I'm a freak.
00:17:57 They're going to think like this.
00:17:58 The first thing you do when you get in is just laugh to yourself, really loud.
00:18:03 They're going to think this guy laughs.
00:18:05 This guy is entertained.
00:18:07 What a server.
00:18:09 They're all like, wait a minute, I recognize that voice and they check.
00:18:13 Is that Ben St. from the Procrastinators podcast?
00:18:15 I love Ben St. Vapors.
00:18:17 I love Slime and Punishment.
00:18:19 Oh my God.
00:18:20 Is that Ben St.?
00:18:21 He was my least favorite member of the podcast.
00:18:23 Fuck, he lives in my house.
00:18:25 Ben St. the guy who ruined the PCP with his left, shoving his lefty politics to everything.
00:18:30 I fucking hate that guy.
00:18:31 I'm going to post on Kiwi Forms about this.
00:18:33 I'm going to find this address.
00:18:34 We got to kill him.
00:18:36 Uh-oh, where's it gone?
00:18:38 Wait, where's Kiwi Form?
00:18:39 Wait, where'd it go?
00:18:40 Where did it go?
00:18:41 No.
00:18:43 Did you hear?
00:18:44 I know yesterday it was that they got like some sort of server in Russia now,
00:18:48 but even that got taken down apparently.
00:18:50 I saw, um-
00:18:51 Lol.
00:18:52 Yeah, today?
00:18:53 No, I think I saw today or yesterday that like, now when you load it up,
00:18:57 it's like due to an imminent threat to human life.
00:19:01 Cloudflare is no longer hosting this fucking-
00:19:04 Yeah, blocked.
00:19:05 What happened?
00:19:06 Due to an imminent and emergency threat to human life,
00:19:08 the constant of the site is blocked from being accessed through Cloudflare's infrastructure.
00:19:13 So, you know.
00:19:14 Interesting.
00:19:16 And then it links to a blog post directly from Kiwi Forms,
00:19:19 or no, from Cloudflare, not from Kiwi Forms.
00:19:23 Oh yeah, they dropped the whole article about it.
00:19:25 Yeah.
00:19:26 Wow, okay.
00:19:27 So that's serious.
00:19:29 That's serious business.
00:19:30 I saw that whole tweet about a way to hold up every one moment.
00:19:35 Eleazar, I'm sorry to keep changing my volume.
00:19:38 I just have to keep moving my head left and right to speak into the microphone
00:19:43 versus look at a screen.
00:19:46 I gotta get my screen time.
00:19:48 Go back to the party.
00:19:51 I'm very hungover, by the way.
00:19:52 Oh.
00:19:53 I'm a little bit hungover, yeah.
00:19:55 I didn't drink that much.
00:19:56 I just didn't hydrate.
00:19:57 I didn't drink any water before I went to bed, and it's-
00:20:00 And I ate pepperoni pizza.
00:20:02 Yeah, so the dehydration-
00:20:04 is what's killing me right now.
00:20:06 That's like the perfect recipe for acid reflux.
00:20:10 Oh, it was so good, though.
00:20:11 Oh, it was so good.
00:20:12 It was worth it.
00:20:13 I would do it again.
00:20:18 I love sin.
00:20:19 Ben, how?
00:20:20 Let me sin.
00:20:21 I love sin.
00:20:22 I love crime.
00:20:23 I hate the cops.
00:20:25 I love to engage in antisocial behavior.
00:20:29 Ben, how did the filming go?
00:20:33 Oh, did I not talk about that last week?
00:20:36 Did I do that?
00:20:37 Well, you were about to do it.
00:20:38 Oh, my God.
00:20:39 But we were doing the thing.
00:20:41 And so, in the week since you have done it, I hear-
00:20:45 God, so much, so much shit happened this week.
00:20:49 Wow, I can't believe it's all the same week.
00:20:51 Wow, wow.
00:20:52 Oh, man, I'm overwhelmed.
00:20:54 Ah, ah, I can't see.
00:20:56 Ah, like, ah, I'm over, I can't-
00:20:59 I'm blinded.
00:21:00 Ah!
00:21:01 You know, there are some weeks-
00:21:02 I'm not being overwhelmed.
00:21:03 There are some, there are some decades where nothing happens
00:21:06 and there are some weeks where decades happen.
00:21:09 You know what I'm saying?
00:21:10 Yeah, I gotcha.
00:21:12 This was a, yeah, well, I filmed the thing
00:21:16 and I'll just tell, I told you already,
00:21:19 but I have 14 hours of footage,
00:21:23 which I will have to cut down.
00:21:25 I expect it will cut down into maybe something like eight.
00:21:31 To 10 hours, perhaps.
00:21:34 I think it came out okay.
00:21:38 Part of me wants to-
00:21:41 I haven't started editing it.
00:21:43 Part of me thinks that I might start editing it
00:21:45 and decide it's bad and I should just do it again.
00:21:48 There's a non-zero chance that I will just simply do it again
00:21:52 because my speech is annoying.
00:21:56 I feel like I said, ah, ah, ah, too much.
00:22:00 You just gotta cut that out.
00:22:02 I will try my best to cut that out.
00:22:05 Sometimes I do it in the middle of a sentence, though,
00:22:07 in a way that is hard to cut around.
00:22:09 Make it a drinking game.
00:22:11 I'm gonna start editing and maybe I'll edit an hour of it
00:22:15 and then I'll watch that back and if the hour sucks,
00:22:18 I might just be like, okay, that was just my first take.
00:22:22 That was just practice run. Let me just do it for real.
00:22:25 But I don't know. It might be okay.
00:22:27 I'll have to see.
00:22:29 But yeah, I spent two days. I woke up.
00:22:32 I woke up, yeah, right after the PCP last week,
00:22:34 I set up the shot and it took me-
00:22:38 actually, it took me quite a long time to get the shot set up.
00:22:41 I didn't actually start recording until like 2 p.m. or something.
00:22:46 So, yeah, I didn't start recording for several hours
00:22:49 because I had to set it all up.
00:22:51 And then I went all day until the sun was down
00:22:55 and it was dark, so I did not get to keep sunlight.
00:22:58 It was okay. The shot was bright enough with the spotlight
00:23:02 even when the sun went down and it was dark.
00:23:04 The only difference is that when the sun was down,
00:23:08 the shadow behind me got really deep.
00:23:10 So, you can see the shot stays lit,
00:23:12 but the shadow behind me gets darker and darker
00:23:15 as the sun goes down because of the secondary lighting went away.
00:23:18 And then I woke up early the next day
00:23:20 and then I started in the morning and then I just went all day.
00:23:23 And the sun went down again.
00:23:25 So, you can see the sunrise inset twice during this 14 hours
00:23:30 that I was recording.
00:23:32 It was really epic.
00:23:34 Yeah, I think so.
00:23:36 I hope it turns out good.
00:23:39 It's going to take me a while to cut it all down.
00:23:42 Is the whole thing actually going to be 8 hours?
00:23:45 I would expect it will cut down to something like 8 to 10 hours.
00:23:51 We're going to sound like a bunch of hippie crits
00:23:53 and we start shitting on Unique Namosaurus later on this podcast.
00:23:56 Man, fuck Unique Namosaurus. I fucking hate him.
00:23:59 He's not merely an NFT shill.
00:24:02 He's a fucking douchebag. He's a fucking twat.
00:24:05 He's a fucking idiot and he's a little pussy bitch.
00:24:08 Little pussy bitch, little coward,
00:24:10 suicide-baiting bitch-man.
00:24:13 Yeah, I haven't followed that.
00:24:16 I've seen bits of it and I was like,
00:24:18 oh, an 8 hour video? Well, I mean, I don't care.
00:24:21 Whatever. I do know about that artist
00:24:24 because I followed them and I liked their art
00:24:27 and then they started doing NFTs.
00:24:29 I was like, okay, fuck it.
00:24:30 And then I unfollowed and that was the end of my interaction.
00:24:33 I had never seen that artist before.
00:24:36 They just made cute little moving gifts
00:24:39 with big booby anime girls and I was like, that's cute.
00:24:42 Well, who could say no to that?
00:24:44 It's so, I think, I guess, to kind of help people
00:24:48 who don't know what we're talking about.
00:24:50 There's a guy called Unique Namosaurus
00:24:52 and he's a YouTuber.
00:24:54 I had seen him in the context of his pro piracy video.
00:24:59 He made an anime video about how piracy is good
00:25:03 and you should pirate anime, which was cool and I liked it.
00:25:06 Years ago.
00:25:07 Yeah, and that's usually how that starts, right?
00:25:10 They make a video earlier on in their career
00:25:12 and that's super cool and then later,
00:25:14 they're more shittier take-start.
00:25:16 I said that's how it starts.
00:25:18 They have these epic and base takes with their early videos
00:25:22 and then later they're kind of shittier take-start surfacing.
00:25:25 Are you just talking about YouTubers in general?
00:25:27 Yeah, just YouTubers in general.
00:25:29 People I hate, you know.
00:25:31 People I hate.
00:25:33 People I hate is usually how it starts.
00:25:35 They have one good take and then they get your guard down
00:25:38 and then they hit you.
00:25:40 And then they hit you with their real opinion.
00:25:42 Right.
00:25:43 And after that, his worst take was abolishing copyright,
00:25:49 which I technically agree,
00:25:52 but I don't think it would work in today's society.
00:25:55 I think I, yeah, I don't know.
00:25:58 I haven't seen that video.
00:25:59 I think I like it.
00:26:00 I think I'm generally pro.
00:26:02 I haven't seen the video in a while,
00:26:06 but I do remember some key moments.
00:26:08 What about copyright?
00:26:10 Copyright law mostly punishes the little guy
00:26:14 in favor of the big guy at this point in time.
00:26:17 He kind of frames it as the like,
00:26:20 if a corporation fails to deliver on something,
00:26:23 then people should just use the copyright.
00:26:26 The free market should allow.
00:26:29 Yeah, like the ultimate free market argument.
00:26:33 I'm pro market when it comes to things of no real consequence,
00:26:37 like fucking, you know, IPs and shows and whatever.
00:26:42 So I mean, sounds fine.
00:26:44 Sounds fine.
00:26:45 Yeah, but he gave this one example that would never happen.
00:26:49 And like, it would never happen like now or in the next,
00:26:53 I didn't think it would happen in the next 50 years.
00:26:55 I think we'll probably be dead when this,
00:26:57 like this example could be fully applied in real life.
00:27:00 But he said that like, imagine, imagine if you will,
00:27:03 Disney makes bad Star Wars movies.
00:27:05 Just imagine that.
00:27:06 Okay, sorry.
00:27:07 This is strengthening my suspension of disbelief a little bit.
00:27:10 Okay, let's say this.
00:27:11 Okay.
00:27:12 Let's just say you live in a world where they make bad Star Wars
00:27:14 movie and also copyright is abolish.
00:27:17 Now, like nothing is literally stopping like a group of people
00:27:20 going on Kickstarter saying like, we're going to kickstart
00:27:22 the good Star Wars movie, just give us this money
00:27:25 and we're going to compete at the same level.
00:27:28 We're going to make the last Jedi or no,
00:27:30 what's the good one?
00:27:31 What's the Ryan Johnson one?
00:27:33 Yeah, the last Jedi.
00:27:34 Is that the last Jedi?
00:27:35 We're going to remake the last Jedi,
00:27:37 but we're not going to have Luke be such a pussy.
00:27:40 He's going to be, he's definitely not going to do,
00:27:43 think about killing, what's his name?
00:27:46 Hello.
00:27:47 Adam Driver.
00:27:48 He's going to be.
00:27:49 Ray is definitely going to have a connection to someone
00:27:52 from previously in the series.
00:27:53 Like she's not going to be a complete,
00:27:55 strangely come out of nowhere because that's weird.
00:27:57 That's just, man, that's too different.
00:27:59 It doesn't make any sense.
00:28:00 I can't take it.
00:28:01 Then why would she be special if she wasn't Palpatine's
00:28:03 granddaughter?
00:28:04 I'm sorry.
00:28:05 Why would she be special if she has a vagina that doesn't
00:28:07 make any sense?
00:28:08 That's an argument for.
00:28:10 Lightsaber is in the shape of a penis.
00:28:12 Yeah, it never says in the movies,
00:28:15 but the female Jedi all have vagina shaped lightsabers,
00:28:18 obviously.
00:28:19 Obviously.
00:28:20 So he's arguing that with no copyright,
00:28:25 just the little man, just any people could create
00:28:29 a movie at the same level of the last Jedi
00:28:32 to compete against.
00:28:33 Well, if there was no copyright law that was actionable
00:28:39 to stop other people making Star Wars movies,
00:28:42 then how would corporations,
00:28:44 corporations couldn't do anything?
00:28:46 I think that if you think of what it would be like,
00:28:51 it's like, oh, you go to the theater and there's multiple
00:28:54 different films called Star Wars that are made by
00:28:56 different studios and they're just playing at the same time.
00:29:00 Both of the films are going to suffer because people
00:29:03 have to choose one or the other.
00:29:05 They're probably not going to watch both.
00:29:07 So it's the same as somebody releasing a game,
00:29:12 and a similar kind of game with more marketing behind it
00:29:15 is released around the same time.
00:29:18 First game is just going to suffer for being similar
00:29:21 to the other one.
00:29:23 So you'd want to spread it out.
00:29:25 I don't know.
00:29:26 I don't think they would make a lot of money,
00:29:28 but in practice, yeah, I think the one with more funding
00:29:32 would tend to succeed.
00:29:34 Sometimes maybe a corporation would fuck up and make
00:29:37 a shitty movie and somebody else would make a good one.
00:29:40 A Kickstarter would never, like,
00:29:44 not in a fucking million years be able to crank up
00:29:47 as much money as a Star Wars movie ever.
00:29:50 And then even if they get enough to make a decent movie,
00:29:55 people are going to be...
00:29:57 Disney also has ad money.
00:29:59 They could probably even do smear campaigns
00:30:01 against a smaller movie.
00:30:03 A lot could be fucking done to prevent these smaller ones.
00:30:07 And to even get to the first place now,
00:30:10 like, oh, there's no copyright laws,
00:30:13 corporations would never fucking let that happen.
00:30:16 And I can't remember in the video if he says that
00:30:20 he's only applying this to media and entertainment,
00:30:23 but to abolish copyright,
00:30:25 it's not just entertainment that has copyright.
00:30:27 Everything has a copyright,
00:30:29 so you would alter all of society by abolishing copyright.
00:30:34 It's not as simple as, like, Edison.
00:30:37 I think the real thing is that copyright protects ideas
00:30:42 for the end result of being able to profit off of them.
00:30:46 So instead of trying to end copyright,
00:30:49 just end the money thing.
00:30:52 End the incentive to have, like, legal copyright of a thing
00:30:57 so that you can just make whatever you want.
00:31:01 And you don't have to worry about making ends meet with it.
00:31:04 Obviously, huge productions would still cost money,
00:31:08 like, I don't know, capitalism's behind it all.
00:31:13 Oh, man, oh, god, this is...
00:31:16 There's so much, like, little things that are being said
00:31:18 that reminds me of what he says in this eight-hour video,
00:31:20 because I actually sat through and watched the whole thing,
00:31:22 because, I mean, I can already tell by the thumbnail
00:31:25 in just the eight hours that I'm not going to like this,
00:31:27 but I need to confirm that I don't like it,
00:31:29 so I watched the whole thing.
00:31:31 Let's, like, set the stage, I guess.
00:31:33 So from what I understand,
00:31:35 Unique Name of Service has made an eight-hour video
00:31:39 talking about the harassment of an artist who got into NFTs,
00:31:46 and they called out some people,
00:31:50 and it was eight hours long.
00:31:52 I would say...
00:31:53 That's the thing we're talking about.
00:31:55 Out of the eight hours,
00:31:58 like, really, the video had no reason to be eight hours.
00:32:01 Yeah, you couldn't possibly have the eight hours of information in there.
00:32:05 I could maybe, like, I could maybe, like,
00:32:08 maybe at the most say, like, it could have been two hours,
00:32:11 fucking been, like, 30 minutes.
00:32:13 They're going to call me a hypocrite when my eight-hour long video comes out,
00:32:17 when my eight-hour video, in which I talk about how much I was bullied,
00:32:23 that's what my video is about, spoiler.
00:32:26 Worse, he would call you a lefty,
00:32:28 because, like, there's, like, a section,
00:32:30 there's, like, a section in the last two minutes
00:32:33 where he, like, points out that, like, he's like,
00:32:36 I noticed that a lot of anti-NFT people
00:32:39 hate capitalism and are lefties.
00:32:41 That's so weird.
00:32:42 That is so weird. That's so fucking weird.
00:32:44 What does it mean? What does it mean, though?
00:32:46 Clearly, there's an agenda.
00:32:48 There's an agenda. Oh, my God.
00:32:50 There's a fucking lefty agenda.
00:32:52 Man, did you see that Biden speech?
00:32:54 Mmm, was a little bit political for my taste.
00:32:56 Ben, you're unironic. You unironically sound like he did,
00:32:59 in the fucking, in that part of the video.
00:33:01 What a twat. What a cut.
00:33:02 He was, like, he was saying it, like, he was saying it,
00:33:05 like, lefties was, like, a dirty word or something,
00:33:07 like, you guys, I don't, I don't want to make this claim, guys.
00:33:10 I don't want to get political. What a dummy.
00:33:12 I don't want to get political, but, like,
00:33:14 all these, like, anti-NFT people just lefties,
00:33:16 and then, and oh, my God, he fucking, a big,
00:33:20 the whole, the whole section where, like,
00:33:22 I know in the thumbnail it says, like,
00:33:24 oh, they didn't even care when she disappeared,
00:33:26 like, making it seem like something terrible
00:33:28 happened to her.
00:33:29 When we have no idea what happened to her in those four months,
00:33:31 he doesn't even fucking know.
00:33:33 He just says she was gone for four months.
00:33:35 She just stopped posting.
00:33:36 She just stopped posting.
00:33:37 And that's the, and that's the, the tragedy
00:33:39 that was supposed to be our hook.
00:33:40 First of all, is the video, like,
00:33:42 mostly about her specifically?
00:33:44 No, no, the vid, she, he only talks about her
00:33:46 for, like, maybe 30 minutes.
00:33:48 And it's nothing even, nothing has occurred.
00:33:50 Nothing happened.
00:33:52 I'm, I'm still confused as to what, like,
00:33:56 what the rest of the video is?
00:33:57 Well, not just that, but, like, what is the point?
00:34:00 Like, what, what, what was he getting at?
00:34:02 I mean, the, the ultimate point is,
00:34:04 NFT's good.
00:34:06 And the argument for that-
00:34:07 Is that really?
00:34:08 The argument for that is people bullied this NFT artist
00:34:11 and it was mean of them to do that.
00:34:14 Yes.
00:34:15 Yum.
00:34:16 So, it's the, the start of the video kind of, like,
00:34:20 talks about how, like, one thing that's super annoying is,
00:34:24 so if you notice that the title of the video is
00:34:28 how Twitter backstabbed the artist.
00:34:30 Right.
00:34:31 And, and the way he talks about Twitter,
00:34:33 you would think Twitter's a person.
00:34:35 Yes.
00:34:36 He's already like a, like a stupid, like a dumb-
00:34:39 He's talking about, by Twitter, he means, like,
00:34:41 the people on Twitter.
00:34:43 He's talking about, yes.
00:34:44 And he, and he's specifically talking about the
00:34:46 Twitter art community.
00:34:47 Yes.
00:34:48 And he starts the video by saying, like, yeah,
00:34:50 you know, I used to, you know, I used to be kind of
00:34:52 involved in the art community because, you know,
00:34:54 I am, I have a guy who's working on my
00:34:56 pirate comic that no one wants to fucking read.
00:34:59 And-
00:35:00 Okay.
00:35:01 And, and he started-
00:35:02 Sure, whatever.
00:35:03 I noticed that on art Twitter,
00:35:05 the community is always helpful.
00:35:06 They're always like passing information to
00:35:08 helping out each other.
00:35:09 But then when NFT dropped, everyone turned
00:35:11 to evil and everyone started to attack
00:35:13 each other.
00:35:14 Everyone turned to evil.
00:35:15 Yeah.
00:35:16 Yeah.
00:35:17 And that, and that's when they started
00:35:18 backstabbing.
00:35:19 That's when the backstabbing started.
00:35:20 Absolutely.
00:35:21 When, and, and he, and he has a beef.
00:35:23 He has like a, he has some couple of gears
00:35:25 to grind against Dan Olson.
00:35:27 And it's like two hour line go up.
00:35:29 No kidding.
00:35:30 No kidding.
00:35:31 Yeah.
00:35:32 Yeah.
00:35:33 Yeah.
00:35:34 Okay.
00:35:35 I'll see if they have a point.
00:35:36 They, they, there's people in the comments
00:35:38 saying this is the part where they talk
00:35:40 about Dan Olson.
00:35:41 I go to their bit and their first point
00:35:44 doesn't make sense.
00:35:45 And so I'm like, okay, well this,
00:35:47 I don't need to watch the rest.
00:35:48 What, do you remember what the point was?
00:35:50 I can't remember.
00:35:51 I can't remember exactly what it was,
00:35:52 but it was just sort of like a false
00:35:53 equivalence of some kind.
00:35:55 Like saying Dan Olson was a liar because
00:35:57 two things that are not mutually exclusive
00:35:59 were said by Dan Olson.
00:36:01 I see, I see.
00:36:02 There's a, there's a couple of times where he's
00:36:04 like comparing tweets and he's like making
00:36:06 it seem like, oh Twitter's hypocritical
00:36:08 because I see these two popular tweets
00:36:10 and it's all like, you know, like,
00:36:12 two different people.
00:36:13 They don't, two different people and also
00:36:15 they don't contradict each other.
00:36:17 I see.
00:36:18 Right.
00:36:19 Because he thinks that if you're,
00:36:20 he thinks that if you're pro commission
00:36:22 but anti NFT, you're a hypocrite
00:36:24 for some reason.
00:36:25 Of course.
00:36:26 That's really, what?
00:36:29 I mean, honestly, that's a little
00:36:31 shocking.
00:36:32 I've never heard people say that.
00:36:33 Oh my God.
00:36:34 Every time he mentions commissions in the
00:36:36 video, he scoffs.
00:36:37 Like if someone suggests commissions,
00:36:39 he's like, he's like, okay.
00:36:41 He even calls it, I think, like, like
00:36:43 slave labor at one point.
00:36:45 Like doing commissions.
00:36:47 Wait.
00:36:48 So it's, it's, it's not just a,
00:36:50 a defensive NFT.
00:36:52 It's an alternative ways.
00:36:54 Okay.
00:36:55 That's weird.
00:36:56 You know, he's, he's shitting on like
00:36:59 relying on a system that has been
00:37:02 helping a lot of artists, even artists
00:37:04 like under 2000 followers on like
00:37:08 Twitter could make, could make
00:37:10 steady income with commissions.
00:37:12 And I, yeah.
00:37:14 And, and also he like, it's, and I,
00:37:18 I think because ultimately he's so
00:37:20 hung up on Dan Olson, Dan Olson.
00:37:22 I need to double check if this is
00:37:24 actually what he said word for word.
00:37:26 But he claims that Dan Olson said that
00:37:28 NFT doesn't help no small artists.
00:37:30 Like it, and a unique name,
00:37:33 a source like interpret this as like
00:37:36 it literally, there's literally no
00:37:38 small artists on the planet ever.
00:37:40 I'm pretty sure.
00:37:42 I'm pretty sure he Dan did not say
00:37:44 if nobody, like no small artists has
00:37:46 ever made any money on an NFT.
00:37:48 I'm pretty sure he wouldn't say something
00:37:50 like that.
00:37:51 In the bit that I looked at,
00:37:52 like they, they pull a clip from
00:37:54 Dan Olson's video, like two clips where
00:37:56 he says that, um, like while
00:38:00 people have profited from it, um,
00:38:03 like, and then there's another clip
00:38:05 where he says it doesn't help artists.
00:38:07 And I think that's what like the,
00:38:09 he's saying that's a contradiction.
00:38:11 Therefore he's lying.
00:38:12 It's what they call it.
00:38:13 Like he pulls a clip saying that
00:38:15 Dan Olson acknowledges that,
00:38:17 that's that like people have made
00:38:19 money off it.
00:38:20 Right.
00:38:21 Gotcha.
00:38:22 Yeah.
00:38:23 The, the specific thing that he's
00:38:24 referring to is that like Dan Olson
00:38:25 said that like, um, a lot of art
00:38:27 thieves, art thieves could potentially
00:38:29 make a profit with NFT.
00:38:31 Yeah.
00:38:32 And then, and then Dan Olson later
00:38:34 says that like, oh,
00:38:35 small artists can't profit from NFT.
00:38:37 And he's like, this is a contradiction
00:38:39 because like suddenly thieves
00:38:41 contradiction like small artists.
00:38:43 Right.
00:38:44 Which like, he doesn't,
00:38:46 does he not consider that like a
00:38:48 couple of things, like preventing
00:38:50 a smaller artist from profiting the
00:38:52 NFT compared to a thief is that
00:38:54 the artist has to make the art
00:38:56 and that takes time.
00:38:57 Right.
00:38:58 And, and no matter how fast the
00:39:00 artist you are, you can never.
00:39:01 This reminds me.
00:39:02 The speed of a thief who just goes
00:39:04 around, finds something cool and
00:39:05 that makes it into NFT.
00:39:06 Oh, this reminds me of, um,
00:39:08 that video that I mentioned a couple
00:39:10 of episodes ago, uh, Dark Viper
00:39:12 AU's video about how
00:39:14 reaction content is basically
00:39:16 wage theft in that it is
00:39:18 pretty much just monetizing other
00:39:20 people's work and, and, and
00:39:22 aggregating it.
00:39:23 Uh, yeah.
00:39:25 Like the, the, the, the reactor
00:39:26 does not have to put any effort
00:39:28 into make the content.
00:39:29 They just profit by presenting
00:39:31 it in this fashion.
00:39:32 Same with an NFT art
00:39:34 thief.
00:39:35 They don't, yeah.
00:39:36 The artist has to make the art
00:39:37 and that and mint it.
00:39:38 So that's an additional cost that
00:39:39 the thief doesn't, doesn't have
00:39:41 to put into the system
00:39:43 to engage with it.
00:39:45 Um, I have not seen, yeah,
00:39:47 I haven't seen any of the video
00:39:48 by the way, except for the clip
00:39:49 that you posted of him talking
00:39:51 about, uh,
00:39:53 Oh, Freddie, Freddie River Ross.
00:39:55 She's like, she's lucky.
00:39:56 She's, you're lucky that she
00:39:57 came back when she did, or you
00:39:58 would be in big trouble, Mr.
00:40:00 I have a clip that would end
00:40:02 your career and mine.
00:40:04 I'm going to burn the whole
00:40:05 system down.
00:40:06 Uh, or whatever it was.
00:40:07 Yeah.
00:40:08 Is it like a DM there?
00:40:09 I don't, I don't.
00:40:10 Did he get into any info about
00:40:11 that?
00:40:12 He said he, he said he had some
00:40:13 video that would
00:40:15 incriminate someone and then
00:40:16 when pressed about it, he said,
00:40:18 no, I was just talking about
00:40:20 an earlier cut of the video that
00:40:22 I changed because it was too
00:40:23 harsh.
00:40:25 So he was going to be even
00:40:26 meaner and that would have
00:40:28 destroyed rubber Ross's career
00:40:29 and his own.
00:40:30 And his own.
00:40:31 And his own.
00:40:32 And his own.
00:40:33 And his own pizza.
00:40:34 Yes.
00:40:35 He would have, he would have
00:40:36 like ranted so hard against
00:40:37 them that their career would
00:40:38 just like show.
00:40:39 The video was going to be
00:40:40 nine hours long and that would
00:40:41 have literally killed them.
00:40:42 But he decided to hold back.
00:40:43 Spent a whole hour just
00:40:44 shitting on rubber Ross and
00:40:45 pan pizza.
00:40:46 Is, is the implication, is the
00:40:47 implication that they would
00:40:48 have said, fuck you.
00:40:50 Not that they have more evidence
00:40:52 that they're withholding, but
00:40:53 that they would have been
00:40:54 nastier.
00:40:55 I think in their video.
00:40:56 It's, I don't.
00:40:57 It's hard to tell.
00:40:58 Because it's a weird.
00:40:59 He words the fret so weirdly
00:41:01 because.
00:41:02 When I first watched it, I
00:41:03 thought he meant that, oh, he
00:41:04 has like maybe some sort of
00:41:05 video evidence of some.
00:41:07 He has like the Epstein flight
00:41:08 logs of YouTubers or something
00:41:10 against.
00:41:11 Yeah.
00:41:12 And he's about to destroy all
00:41:13 three of them, but then
00:41:14 re listening to it.
00:41:15 I'm kind of like, wait, no, it
00:41:16 sounds like he's saying
00:41:17 that he's going to, he's going
00:41:19 to rant about them and he's
00:41:20 going to put this rant on
00:41:22 every one of his videos at the
00:41:23 end.
00:41:24 So people are always reminded
00:41:25 that like.
00:41:26 That's like, that's his log
00:41:28 offline.
00:41:29 It's like, and hey, thanks
00:41:30 for, thanks for watching the
00:41:31 new video.
00:41:32 Shout out to my five dollar
00:41:33 patrons.
00:41:34 So and so such and such and
00:41:35 watch his name.
00:41:36 And remember, rubber Ross and
00:41:37 pan pizza bullied an NFT
00:41:39 artist and just suicide on
00:41:40 August of 2020.
00:41:42 2022.
00:41:43 Okay.
00:41:44 Thanks for watching.
00:41:45 See you in the next video.
00:41:47 That was the plan.
00:41:49 Good, good, good.
00:41:52 And you know what's another
00:41:53 fucking thing that he says that
00:41:54 that earlier in the video, he
00:41:56 says that he doesn't believe
00:41:57 that like, like these
00:41:59 celebs or influencers are
00:42:00 responsible for what their
00:42:01 fans do.
00:42:02 Okay.
00:42:03 But he, but he, he tries to
00:42:04 kind of like make
00:42:06 what rubber Ross and pan pizza
00:42:07 did as like the exception to
00:42:09 that rule because like, well,
00:42:11 you see, you see, I get it.
00:42:13 If I get it, if you're like a
00:42:14 smaller person and you're
00:42:15 shitting on a bigger person and
00:42:17 that bigger person brings their
00:42:18 fandom, that makes sense.
00:42:19 But um, several like literally
00:42:21 was just mining her own business
00:42:22 and then pan peaks and rubber
00:42:24 Ross accused her of being a
00:42:25 thief.
00:42:26 And it's like your, your logic
00:42:27 like it's still a bias to like
00:42:29 they, they called her a thief,
00:42:30 but they didn't fucking say to
00:42:31 like everyone make sure she
00:42:32 kills herself.
00:42:33 I did.
00:42:34 Yeah, I did see.
00:42:35 So Ross did call her a thief
00:42:37 or accused her of stealing
00:42:39 designs, right?
00:42:40 Or of stealing somebody else's
00:42:41 like character designs or
00:42:43 something like that.
00:42:44 Yeah, yeah.
00:42:45 Yeah, but that was, that seemed
00:42:47 dumb.
00:42:48 Like that seemed like it was not
00:42:49 the case.
00:42:50 I, I like it, it, it's a very
00:42:52 generic looking character to be
00:42:54 honest.
00:42:55 Yeah.
00:42:56 Although I'll admit it and like
00:42:57 if you in the follow video if
00:42:59 unique name of source wants to
00:43:00 clip this, I'll admit it.
00:43:01 Like I don't give a fuck.
00:43:03 I don't care.
00:43:04 I retweeted, I retweeted the pan
00:43:05 like, um, claiming that it was
00:43:08 an RFP thing.
00:43:09 I don't give a shit.
00:43:11 So it wasn't, it wasn't.
00:43:12 So they said it was our theft
00:43:13 and it wasn't though.
00:43:14 It wasn't our feather.
00:43:16 Just that two people drew the
00:43:17 same generic like water based
00:43:19 girl looking character.
00:43:21 Right.
00:43:22 Right.
00:43:23 Um, and yeah, Ross was like,
00:43:24 Ross was like, uh, oh, she's,
00:43:26 she's drawing so and so's
00:43:28 character because this other
00:43:29 character, this other person
00:43:30 had a character who's a girl
00:43:32 with, with water for hair.
00:43:34 I think of the name of the
00:43:35 artist.
00:43:36 I have a girl who has water
00:43:37 for hair.
00:43:38 Do you?
00:43:39 Yeah, but you gotta stop
00:43:40 stealing.
00:43:41 It's my mermaid.
00:43:42 Yeah.
00:43:43 Stop stealing right now.
00:43:44 Yeah.
00:43:45 I will steal.
00:43:46 Look, great artist steal.
00:43:49 The best artist admitted on,
00:43:51 on the podcast.
00:43:53 Great artist steal and even
00:43:55 better artists make NFTs.
00:43:58 Right there.
00:44:00 Um, where were we?
00:44:03 There's like a, um, there's
00:44:05 this whole section at the
00:44:06 beginning where like, like I
00:44:08 said earlier, you get super
00:44:09 hanged up on, on Daniels and
00:44:10 saying like NFTs, like doesn't
00:44:12 help any small artists.
00:44:14 It's not like, um, oh yeah.
00:44:16 Well, I did a quick search and
00:44:19 I found 25 small artists that
00:44:21 were successful with NFTs.
00:44:23 Oh my God.
00:44:24 That's what a fucking tweet.
00:44:26 It's, it's stupid.
00:44:28 I feel personally, I feel
00:44:29 personally aggrieved by him.
00:44:31 My, my, my, my, my, my hate is,
00:44:33 my hate is personal to him.
00:44:35 This is not about the issues
00:44:36 anymore.
00:44:37 I just want to, I just want to
00:44:38 punch him.
00:44:39 It's not even, it's, it's not
00:44:40 even 25 artists.
00:44:41 It's 24 artists.
00:44:42 One of them I don't count
00:44:43 because it's a, it's an AI
00:44:44 artist.
00:44:45 Oh yeah.
00:44:46 So it's like.
00:44:47 Oh God.
00:44:48 That's a whole other can of
00:44:49 worms then.
00:44:50 So a person types in a thing,
00:44:51 they get an image and they
00:44:52 NFT mint it.
00:44:53 Yes.
00:44:54 And they're making money.
00:44:55 Yes.
00:44:56 Stupid.
00:44:57 Well.
00:44:58 Whatever.
00:44:59 Yeah.
00:45:00 It's so.
00:45:01 Good for them.
00:45:02 Yes.
00:45:03 So he's, and the thing is that
00:45:04 like you need to, and here's
00:45:05 here's the thing.
00:45:06 All of Unique's video is just
00:45:07 anecdotes.
00:45:08 There's like no like real, the
00:45:10 only part where he like talks
00:45:11 about statistics is when he
00:45:12 talks about the environmental
00:45:14 damage of like NFTs is like when
00:45:16 he only actually brings up any
00:45:18 like real statistics.
00:45:19 Yeah.
00:45:20 But I feel like the conversation
00:45:21 has generally moved past that
00:45:23 aspect of it.
00:45:24 That's not really what people
00:45:25 are mad about anymore.
00:45:26 Yeah.
00:45:27 Because like it, like he brings
00:45:29 up the chart that's like, sure,
00:45:31 like bitcoins are like make as
00:45:33 much waste as much energy as a
00:45:35 small country.
00:45:36 But like technically speaking,
00:45:38 AC's waste more energy.
00:45:40 Sure.
00:45:41 That being said.
00:45:42 Yeah.
00:45:43 AC's make you cool.
00:45:44 Yeah.
00:45:45 Yeah.
00:45:46 Yeah.
00:45:47 Like Bitcoin is like volatile.
00:45:48 And if we want to go that far,
00:45:49 I mean like heating, you know,
00:45:50 in general, heating apparatus,
00:45:52 apparatuses spend even more
00:45:54 energy than air conditioners.
00:45:56 So, you know, the fact that
00:45:58 people aren't freezing to death
00:45:59 is even more of a problem.
00:46:01 He really is trying to like,
00:46:03 he brings up all these arguments
00:46:04 trying to like make NFTs seem
00:46:06 like something that's happening,
00:46:08 like comparing it to something to
00:46:09 make it seem a little bit like
00:46:11 less of a shit show.
00:46:13 Like he's like, oh,
00:46:14 NFT collectors, they're kind of
00:46:16 like, they're kind of like Hype
00:46:17 Beast.
00:46:18 Do you guys know what Hype Beast
00:46:19 are?
00:46:20 Not really.
00:46:21 Person who hypes stuff up.
00:46:22 They're the, they're the guys who
00:46:23 buy like the Supreme Merch,
00:46:24 like they wait in lines and they
00:46:26 buy like all the expensive shoes.
00:46:28 Are they just, are they just
00:46:29 fencers?
00:46:30 Like they buy, buy shit up and
00:46:31 then resell it?
00:46:33 No, no, it's more like a cloud
00:46:35 thing.
00:46:36 Like, oh yeah, I have the news
00:46:37 Supreme.
00:46:38 Yeah, I mean, I've heard,
00:46:39 I've heard the argument like a
00:46:40 hundred times, like people will
00:46:42 buy, um, they will value
00:46:45 things, however they determine
00:46:47 its value that, you know, like
00:46:49 value doesn't really exist.
00:46:51 And so NFT artists can
00:46:53 successfully hoodwink people
00:46:55 into paying larger amount of
00:46:57 money for nothing.
00:46:59 Right.
00:47:00 And I'm like, okay, you can
00:47:01 make money off of it.
00:47:02 I understand.
00:47:03 Yeah.
00:47:04 I hate it though.
00:47:05 It sucks.
00:47:06 So much.
00:47:07 You're making money the same
00:47:08 way you technically make money
00:47:09 by gambling.
00:47:10 And that's not.
00:47:11 Yeah.
00:47:12 Yeah.
00:47:13 And the thing is that like.
00:47:14 It's not productive.
00:47:15 The one thing, it's, we should,
00:47:16 we should be able to agree that
00:47:17 it's not productive.
00:47:18 Yes.
00:47:19 And like on our, on our arm.
00:47:21 It's definitely not the way
00:47:22 forward.
00:47:23 It's just a thing you can do.
00:47:24 To be productive.
00:47:25 But it's, it's, it's the most
00:47:26 like stupid.
00:47:27 It's the most like, like grimy
00:47:30 disgusting capitalistic way to
00:47:32 get it by.
00:47:33 I don't.
00:47:34 I don't.
00:47:35 I don't just like,
00:47:36 I don't begrudge anyone making
00:47:37 a living.
00:47:38 I don't begrudge anyone making
00:47:39 a living.
00:47:40 And if someone's like,
00:47:41 No.
00:47:42 to make money and they do it
00:47:43 by NFTs, like I think that's
00:47:44 not the best way to do it.
00:47:45 But if that's what it takes to
00:47:46 do it, like it's like, I'm not
00:47:47 mad about it.
00:47:48 Yeah.
00:47:49 I just think that like, it's
00:47:50 not the future.
00:47:51 And it certainly,
00:47:52 certainly isn't a future we
00:47:53 would want to like push for
00:47:54 because it's so much.
00:47:55 It's just the, the system we
00:47:56 have now, but worse in various
00:47:58 ways.
00:47:59 I would argue.
00:48:00 That's it.
00:48:01 I would argue NFTs, like
00:48:02 evidence that like the future
00:48:03 looks fucking bleak and shitty.
00:48:05 Yeah.
00:48:06 And um, yeah, if they became,
00:48:08 if they became mainstream,
00:48:10 yeah, it would be, it was,
00:48:11 if the future would be worse
00:48:12 for it.
00:48:13 Another kind of egregious
00:48:15 thing is that like, he doesn't
00:48:16 like, um, if you guys heard
00:48:17 about this, his hashtag, it was
00:48:19 like, I'm at the start of the
00:48:20 year, I think called the, the
00:48:22 animation new deal thing where
00:48:24 they were trying to like,
00:48:26 yeah, unionize the majority
00:48:28 of animation studios.
00:48:29 I saw it.
00:48:30 Yes.
00:48:31 Yeah.
00:48:32 He, he frames this as people
00:48:33 who are like pro that, but
00:48:35 our anti NFTs are also
00:48:37 hypocrites.
00:48:38 Like, like if you're pro
00:48:39 anything, if you're pro, like
00:48:41 anything that helps artists,
00:48:42 but NFTs, you are by the
00:48:44 fault of hypocrite.
00:48:45 I get you.
00:48:46 Because you can make money,
00:48:47 but you can make money.
00:48:48 But you could, but you could
00:48:49 like, like Dan also said,
00:48:50 you couldn't make money, but
00:48:51 um, I found 24 people that
00:48:52 made money.
00:48:53 So, um, Dan also,
00:48:54 what did Dan, what did Dan
00:48:56 say?
00:48:57 He, there's that part where he
00:48:58 says, um, like, you know, the
00:49:00 reaction is confusion.
00:49:01 Like, you know, we don't, you
00:49:03 want to make money?
00:49:04 Like we're here to make money
00:49:05 on NFTs.
00:49:06 Don't you want to make money?
00:49:07 Like what's, what's the
00:49:08 problem?
00:49:09 I was going to mention this
00:49:10 earlier.
00:49:11 There, there's really no point
00:49:12 of like bringing up like 24
00:49:14 artists that made money off
00:49:16 NFTs.
00:49:17 He could have brought up like
00:49:18 a thousand small artists who
00:49:20 also made money.
00:49:21 It doesn't matter because he
00:49:22 doesn't have nothing.
00:49:23 He has nothing to compare it
00:49:24 to.
00:49:25 He doesn't bring it up like
00:49:26 okay, now bring up all the
00:49:28 small artists.
00:49:29 It didn't help.
00:49:30 Let's see if it really does
00:49:31 help small artists.
00:49:32 Right.
00:49:33 Because it could be, oh, it
00:49:35 could be, it is literally like
00:49:37 going to a casino and finding
00:49:39 the couple of guys who won at
00:49:41 Blackjack and being like, look,
00:49:42 see, the casino helps people.
00:49:44 People will make money.
00:49:45 Dan also claims that you can't
00:49:47 make money at a casino, but I
00:49:49 found five bald guys that
00:49:51 helped.
00:49:52 So, um,
00:49:53 Five bald guys?
00:49:55 I found five.
00:49:56 Sure.
00:49:57 I just added a random attribute
00:49:58 to these guys.
00:49:59 Okay, sure.
00:50:00 No, I think it's bald.
00:50:01 That's fine.
00:50:02 That's fine.
00:50:03 I found 30, I found 30
00:50:04 querked up white boys who have
00:50:05 made plenty of cash off
00:50:07 casinos.
00:50:08 But it doesn't, like you can,
00:50:10 yeah, you can make money, but
00:50:11 can you fucking make a living
00:50:12 if the currency is supposed to
00:50:14 be volatile?
00:50:15 It's going to be smarter to
00:50:16 rely on a currency that isn't
00:50:18 fucking always rising up and
00:50:19 down and constantly fucking
00:50:20 crashing.
00:50:21 Yeah.
00:50:22 Yeah.
00:50:23 And there's that side of it
00:50:24 where it's like, it's a gamble
00:50:25 to get into for the artist.
00:50:27 Like you're not necessarily
00:50:28 going to make a lot of money
00:50:29 and there is a cost to put an
00:50:31 NFT, like mint one.
00:50:33 So like you're putting down
00:50:34 monies on the off chance that
00:50:36 somebody in your audience will
00:50:38 like NFTs and buy it.
00:50:40 But there's also the,
00:50:42 the, the scam aspect of like,
00:50:46 you have to try to sell the
00:50:48 idea of NFTs to people so that
00:50:50 they will buy it.
00:50:51 And so you will just naturally
00:50:53 not talk about the negative
00:50:55 stuff.
00:50:56 And you will scam people into
00:50:57 getting into it.
00:50:58 And it's just, it's like,
00:51:00 it's like, I don't know, like
00:51:02 your odds of winning at the
00:51:04 casino, if you like pyramid
00:51:06 scheme people to come to the
00:51:07 casino, your odds will improve.
00:51:09 And so naturally that's going
00:51:10 to happen.
00:51:11 And it's all, it's just so
00:51:13 disgusting.
00:51:14 Yeah.
00:51:15 There's so many victims.
00:51:16 It's like, there's so obviously
00:51:18 a bad thing generally.
00:51:19 Yeah.
00:51:20 It's free.
00:51:21 It's pretty myopic.
00:51:22 It's pretty myopic to just be
00:51:23 like, well, some people
00:51:26 succeeded.
00:51:27 So it's good.
00:51:28 There's this also this whole
00:51:30 section he dedicates to like,
00:51:31 does he, okay, I'm sorry, does
00:51:33 he have a personal stake?
00:51:34 Like, is he doing NFT stuff?
00:51:36 Is he planning on doing NFT stuff?
00:51:38 He must have a personal
00:51:40 stake.
00:51:41 He said, he said if this video
00:51:43 ruins his like YouTube career,
00:51:45 he is, he's going to start doing
00:51:47 NFTs.
00:51:48 Oh, so you better not.
00:51:49 So you better like the video or else
00:51:51 there'll be, he'll make even more NFTs.
00:51:52 He'll, he'll hurt the environment
00:51:54 even more.
00:51:55 Oh, what a bitch.
00:51:57 What a fucking bitch.
00:51:58 What a piece of shit.
00:51:59 I hate him.
00:52:00 You need, please make all your videos
00:52:03 into NFTs.
00:52:04 Please.
00:52:05 I want you to make all your fucking videos.
00:52:07 What did I say?
00:52:08 I like mint every individual frame
00:52:10 of every video, mint, you know,
00:52:12 every, every down to the frame time
00:52:14 stamp of every video, you can make
00:52:15 billions and billions of NFTs and sell
00:52:17 each one for a dollar.
00:52:18 At the, at the end of the video,
00:52:20 I'm jumping around because
00:52:22 like conversations
00:52:24 reminded me of so many like random
00:52:26 shit this guy.
00:52:27 Not random, but so the
00:52:29 conversation is reminding me of like
00:52:30 different points in the video.
00:52:31 But at the end of the video, he
00:52:33 talks about the author for
00:52:35 Berserk and like his death and like
00:52:37 how like he knows he didn't work
00:52:39 himself to death and it was just like,
00:52:41 it was like a heart condition that
00:52:42 got him.
00:52:43 But he said that like, let's say there
00:52:44 is a manga artist and
00:52:46 who is in a shitty situation like
00:52:48 that?
00:52:49 And he scoffs the idea
00:52:51 of like, okay, maybe
00:52:53 you could improve working conditions.
00:52:56 Maybe I don't really agree
00:52:58 with like, like unions, you know,
00:53:01 or, or, or, or let me,
00:53:04 the alternative.
00:53:05 Here's his like superior alternative
00:53:07 is like, what if a
00:53:09 mangaka minted every page
00:53:11 of their manga?
00:53:12 True, true.
00:53:13 And, and like imagine
00:53:15 how insane do you need to be
00:53:17 to like acknowledge that there are
00:53:19 things that can be done to improve
00:53:21 the working conditions?
00:53:22 Wait, wait, wait.
00:53:23 No, what if we don't do that?
00:53:25 Let's see where he's going with it.
00:53:26 Let's see where he's going with it.
00:53:28 You don't get it.
00:53:29 Imagine, imagine how much money
00:53:30 you'd get if you have, if you,
00:53:32 if you, if you were the owner
00:53:34 of the, of the page where white
00:53:36 beer says the one piece is real.
00:53:38 Oh my God.
00:53:39 And he has his dick out.
00:53:40 And he has his dick out.
00:53:41 Holy shit.
00:53:42 That would be worth some money.
00:53:44 Oh my God.
00:53:45 And then, and then Oda would have
00:53:47 enough money to like relax.
00:53:48 And it's like,
00:53:49 I don't get the corp.
00:53:50 He has enough money.
00:53:51 It's true.
00:53:52 Cause the thing is that like,
00:53:53 the thing is like better working
00:53:55 conditions assumes that by the fall.
00:53:57 You don't need to fucking add again.
00:53:59 If your, if your favorite mangaka
00:54:01 works himself to death,
00:54:02 Karoshis themselves to death,
00:54:03 and they die, it's your fault.
00:54:05 And you don't want to feel bad,
00:54:06 do you?
00:54:07 So you better buy their fricking NFT.
00:54:09 Is there like any,
00:54:11 I don't know too much about this,
00:54:13 the hard condition thing,
00:54:14 but is there any indication that
00:54:16 Berserk was not popular enough to
00:54:18 support him medically?
00:54:20 Like, is this a situation where
00:54:22 NFTs would have made the difference?
00:54:23 It's so all over the place
00:54:25 because it's kind of like,
00:54:26 okay, so let's say there was like,
00:54:28 there was this one mangaka,
00:54:29 there was this one mangaka recently
00:54:30 got canceled,
00:54:31 but it seemed like it had a small
00:54:32 fandom, which was,
00:54:33 it was like a red writing hood
00:54:35 character,
00:54:36 but she had like big titties
00:54:37 and she was like super buff.
00:54:38 Oh my God.
00:54:39 And so,
00:54:40 right, but it would,
00:54:42 the thing is that that's the only
00:54:43 thing people ever talked about.
00:54:44 So I kind of already knew it was
00:54:45 going to be shit.
00:54:46 Besides,
00:54:47 besides that,
00:54:48 I guess it's like,
00:54:49 okay, so would NFTs help this guy?
00:54:51 Even,
00:54:52 even if like the manga wasn't good,
00:54:54 if you had enough money off of like
00:54:56 the big tittie NFT,
00:54:57 would it have made the manga
00:54:59 keep on going?
00:55:00 Because that implies that like,
00:55:01 like Sean and Joe has,
00:55:03 keeps a percentage of the NFT,
00:55:05 right?
00:55:06 Artists already,
00:55:08 artists already basically do this.
00:55:10 Like a lot of artists do sell their
00:55:12 original pages,
00:55:13 as a,
00:55:14 as a thing.
00:55:15 They sell like copies of it too,
00:55:17 and people like eat it up because
00:55:18 it's like, you know,
00:55:19 it's like physical and like,
00:55:20 it looks just like it, you know?
00:55:22 They sell,
00:55:23 they sell the original animation
00:55:24 cells from like,
00:55:26 cartoons and stuff.
00:55:27 And the thing is that,
00:55:28 that's a thing that people do already.
00:55:29 The thing is that's so crazy,
00:55:30 and he never brings this up,
00:55:31 is that the NFT is not the art.
00:55:34 The NFT is a receipt really.
00:55:36 The NFT is like a link.
00:55:37 And he doesn't,
00:55:38 he doesn't even acknowledge that?
00:55:39 Yeah.
00:55:40 He talked,
00:55:41 he like,
00:55:42 he doesn't really acknowledge that
00:55:43 what you're buying,
00:55:44 but he kind of,
00:55:45 he kind of implies it.
00:55:46 There's a whole section where like,
00:55:48 so you know,
00:55:49 his whole like anti copyright stance.
00:55:51 Sort of.
00:55:52 Yeah.
00:55:53 I mean,
00:55:54 we just,
00:55:55 the little,
00:55:56 his abolishment of copyright,
00:55:58 he argues that,
00:55:59 that doesn't contradict with his like
00:56:01 pro NFT stance.
00:56:02 Right.
00:56:03 And the,
00:56:04 and the thing is that I agree with him,
00:56:05 that it doesn't,
00:56:06 because the way he explains it,
00:56:07 I'm like, okay,
00:56:08 I get it.
00:56:09 I get why like being pro NFT
00:56:11 and being anti copyright doesn't
00:56:13 contradict each other.
00:56:14 Yeah.
00:56:15 Because the thing is that like,
00:56:16 his whole argument is that
00:56:18 like he,
00:56:19 he doesn't think bootlegs are bad.
00:56:21 Like,
00:56:22 if someone,
00:56:23 if something gets bootleg,
00:56:24 that means that like,
00:56:25 there's like a,
00:56:26 there's like a problem.
00:56:27 Yeah.
00:56:28 With the person who's providing
00:56:29 the item in the market,
00:56:30 right?
00:56:31 So bootlegs should be allowed.
00:56:32 That being said,
00:56:33 you can't bootleg an NFT.
00:56:34 Right.
00:56:35 Because an NFT isn't.
00:56:36 The obvious,
00:56:37 yeah.
00:56:38 Yeah.
00:56:39 The,
00:56:40 the obvious question is what if it was,
00:56:41 okay,
00:56:42 what about right-click save?
00:56:43 Right.
00:56:44 Right.
00:56:45 But the thing is,
00:56:46 what's his answer to people
00:56:47 right-click saving the NFT?
00:56:48 Well,
00:56:49 well,
00:56:50 well,
00:56:51 first of all,
00:56:52 he pulls a fucking giant cope
00:56:53 where he's all like,
00:56:54 by the way,
00:56:55 no one was upset about right-click save.
00:56:56 You know,
00:56:57 we,
00:56:58 we all knew it was a joke, guys.
00:56:59 It's not a joke.
00:57:00 We all knew it was a joke.
00:57:01 Cause I,
00:57:02 cause I,
00:57:03 cause I saved the image and I haven't.
00:57:04 Well,
00:57:05 well,
00:57:07 the thing is that I,
00:57:08 I get,
00:57:09 I get it.
00:57:10 I get what he means
00:57:11 because right-click save,
00:57:12 like no,
00:57:13 the NF,
00:57:14 you don't own the NFT
00:57:15 if you save the image
00:57:16 because the image and the NFT
00:57:17 are two different things.
00:57:18 Yes.
00:57:19 Yes.
00:57:20 The NFT is the link.
00:57:21 I'm with you so far.
00:57:22 Okay.
00:57:23 The NFT is the link.
00:57:24 So what,
00:57:25 so what is the NFT guy?
00:57:26 So what,
00:57:27 so what are we,
00:57:28 but what are we talking about?
00:57:29 The NFT is just the idea of scarcity.
00:57:31 It's just the idea of something being rare.
00:57:33 And you can't,
00:57:34 you can't copyright that.
00:57:35 You can't bootleg that, right?
00:57:36 Yeah.
00:57:37 But,
00:57:38 but he doesn't realize,
00:57:39 he doesn't realize that he made the,
00:57:40 the value.
00:57:41 So what's the value then?
00:57:42 He is saying,
00:57:43 he's basically saying by the fault
00:57:45 that NFT is an art.
00:57:47 Right.
00:57:48 That,
00:57:49 that it's not,
00:57:50 and it will never fucking be art.
00:57:51 Right.
00:57:52 At all.
00:57:53 I mean,
00:57:54 he kind of made the argument
00:57:55 that all this shit is like soulless really.
00:57:56 Right.
00:57:57 Because he wants to say that,
00:57:58 like the NFT,
00:57:59 like,
00:58:00 like people who collect NFT
00:58:01 are kind of like hype beasts.
00:58:02 And hype beasts are like
00:58:03 super fucking annoying things.
00:58:04 They're super fucking annoying people.
00:58:05 But I respect them a little bit more,
00:58:08 because when you buy a supreme jacket,
00:58:10 it serves a purpose besides it,
00:58:12 just being a brand.
00:58:13 You could wear a jacket when it's cold.
00:58:15 Right.
00:58:16 Right.
00:58:17 Yeah.
00:58:18 But an NFT like,
00:58:19 no, it's just,
00:58:20 it's just something that potentially could be
00:58:21 scarce or not.
00:58:22 It's depending like,
00:58:23 how the fucking,
00:58:24 how much the point is like.
00:58:25 There's literally,
00:58:26 there's literally nothing to it other than
00:58:27 that you can say you own it.
00:58:29 Right.
00:58:30 Everything that it is.
00:58:33 And people,
00:58:34 people will pay for that.
00:58:35 Sure.
00:58:36 But like buy,
00:58:37 they're,
00:58:38 they're paying for the fact that like,
00:58:39 it's like unique only they could own it,
00:58:41 but it's not the art.
00:58:42 Right.
00:58:43 And he,
00:58:44 he talks,
00:58:45 he brings up some guy who's like,
00:58:46 like,
00:58:47 oh,
00:58:48 here's like a super nice collector who like
00:58:49 buys NFTs and doesn't sell them,
00:58:50 which I don't get.
00:58:51 Like,
00:58:52 I don't get motherfuckers.
00:58:53 What a sweetheart.
00:58:54 Right.
00:58:55 And,
00:58:56 and like he,
00:58:57 he says like,
00:58:58 this guy,
00:58:59 you know,
00:59:00 he buys NFTs and even,
00:59:01 even though when the market was crashing,
00:59:02 he just likes the art.
00:59:03 And it's like,
00:59:04 yeah,
00:59:05 but you just made the argument that the NFT isn't the art.
00:59:06 So he's,
00:59:07 he's virtue signaling.
00:59:08 He's a fucking fake.
00:59:09 Right.
00:59:10 So what,
00:59:11 by the fault.
00:59:12 So what is he,
00:59:13 so what is he actually buying?
00:59:14 Sure.
00:59:15 Gotcha.
00:59:16 I mean,
00:59:17 I would prefer it.
00:59:18 Honestly,
00:59:19 if it was like,
00:59:20 if it was just like,
00:59:21 you give money to an artist for like,
00:59:23 I don't know,
00:59:24 an imaginary piece of an imaginary pie,
00:59:26 just to say,
00:59:27 I support you.
00:59:28 Like that's,
00:59:29 that's,
00:59:30 that's the hypothetical,
00:59:31 most people who buy NFTs try to want to profit off of the idea
00:59:35 that they could sell it on.
00:59:36 There's,
00:59:37 there's nothing about that guy.
00:59:38 Like that guy could just give those artists money.
00:59:40 He could just do the actual,
00:59:42 like give the money.
00:59:43 You could just do that.
00:59:44 And at the end of the day,
00:59:46 he's not really collecting art.
00:59:48 Sure,
00:59:49 it appears on his fucking website,
00:59:50 but there's like,
00:59:51 think of all the people who we have,
00:59:52 like me,
00:59:53 for example,
00:59:54 we used to have like USBs just filled with images that I would collect.
00:59:57 Right.
00:59:58 And to me,
00:59:59 that kind of has a little bit more,
01:00:01 it has a little bit more going than someone's like,
01:00:03 I only collect this image because it's an investment at the end of the day.
01:00:06 So,
01:00:07 so what you're saying is that unique simply does not,
01:00:11 he just equivocates between art and NFT,
01:00:13 seemingly without,
01:00:15 seemingly without any respect for the fact that they are not one in the same.
01:00:19 But he are,
01:00:20 he talks about them as though they are.
01:00:22 Right.
01:00:23 And this makes me think about like,
01:00:25 cause as you mentioned earlier,
01:00:26 like what's stopping the person from just giving the artist money.
01:00:29 And it's like,
01:00:30 people already do that.
01:00:31 Like that's what Patreon is for,
01:00:32 which by the way,
01:00:33 he,
01:00:34 he scoffs at Patreon too.
01:00:36 He scoffs at literally everything that like helps,
01:00:38 that could help an artist.
01:00:40 Right.
01:00:41 Because he also frames like,
01:00:42 he also frames that like,
01:00:43 Oh yeah, you know what?
01:00:44 Patreon takes too big of a cut.
01:00:46 And so does PayPal,
01:00:47 you know,
01:00:48 but the minting fees,
01:00:50 the minting fees though,
01:00:51 that's not,
01:00:52 that doesn't take a cut.
01:00:53 That's just the free market.
01:00:54 That's just the free market.
01:00:55 That's just the free market.
01:00:56 You know,
01:00:57 how like,
01:00:58 how Bandcamp has like,
01:01:00 people who,
01:01:01 who supported an album or a song,
01:01:03 they have their little username and icon underneath it.
01:01:06 So supported by these people.
01:01:08 That would be a nice,
01:01:10 that you could do that.
01:01:11 Like that's,
01:01:12 if you want to support an artist by paying them
01:01:14 and get a little like sticker saying,
01:01:16 you did it,
01:01:17 you own this,
01:01:18 or you are,
01:01:19 you know,
01:01:20 you are a part of this,
01:01:21 like,
01:01:22 like support.
01:01:23 That's the sort of thing that it should be.
01:01:25 Like YouTubers do that with Patreon.
01:01:27 Fucking unique does that.
01:01:28 He does that at the end of this video.
01:01:30 Yeah.
01:01:31 It's just like,
01:01:32 if there's an argument to be made that NFTs are the way to do that,
01:01:35 it's just not true.
01:01:36 There's so many other ways
01:01:37 that are already there for artists
01:01:39 to be supported by fans
01:01:41 who want to be a part of the thing.
01:01:43 There's so many like,
01:01:44 like ways to do it
01:01:45 based on currency that isn't volatile.
01:01:48 You know,
01:01:49 that isn't like a huge gamble to get into.
01:01:51 Right?
01:01:53 Yeah.
01:01:54 It's,
01:01:55 it's fucking,
01:01:56 it's fucking,
01:01:57 it's fucking trash.
01:01:58 And
01:01:59 I think,
01:02:00 if I were to talk about like one more section about the video,
01:02:04 that is just very like,
01:02:07 dumb.
01:02:08 Is the last two hours,
01:02:09 is the anti SJW section of the video?
01:02:13 Because I mentioned earlier that like,
01:02:15 he says lefty,
01:02:16 like a bad word,
01:02:17 like a bad word.
01:02:18 And basically,
01:02:19 like,
01:02:20 unironically,
01:02:21 like he doesn't state this,
01:02:22 he's presenting things.
01:02:23 It seems like he's implying that like,
01:02:25 the NFT artists are like the black people
01:02:27 of the art world,
01:02:28 if you will,
01:02:29 because they're just as oppressed
01:02:31 as black people in real life.
01:02:32 Well, they're,
01:02:33 they're like oppressed by like lefties
01:02:35 who are by the way,
01:02:36 the real races.
01:02:37 Right?
01:02:38 I don't know why,
01:02:40 but the unique name of Somers did not strike me
01:02:42 as a right-leaning person.
01:02:44 He says he's a pro-capitalist libertarian
01:02:47 at the end of the video.
01:02:49 Well.
01:02:50 Right?
01:02:51 He's one,
01:02:52 he's one of the libertarians that have like one,
01:02:54 he's like libertarian,
01:02:55 but one of his like,
01:02:56 takes is like a little bit more left.
01:02:58 Right?
01:02:59 Yeah.
01:03:00 He looks like,
01:03:03 I'm going to get canceled.
01:03:05 He looks like a gender person.
01:03:08 He looks like he has pronouns.
01:03:10 He looks, he does,
01:03:11 honestly,
01:03:12 and you know, it's true,
01:03:13 he does look like he has pronouns.
01:03:15 It looks like he's gonna,
01:03:16 a little bit surprised.
01:03:17 A little bit surprised.
01:03:18 But I also,
01:03:19 I could see it, I could see.
01:03:21 Not that there's anything wrong with that.
01:03:23 Not that there's anything wrong with that.
01:03:25 If you,
01:03:26 if you need,
01:03:27 if you need name of sorts,
01:03:28 gain some pronouns,
01:03:29 I would respect them a little bit,
01:03:30 actually.
01:03:31 I'd be like,
01:03:32 you know what,
01:03:33 pronoun person,
01:03:34 you know,
01:03:35 you're all right.
01:03:36 I would respect the pronouns,
01:03:37 not the person.
01:03:38 Just like I do with everyone.
01:03:41 Oh my God.
01:03:42 And,
01:03:43 he just kind of like,
01:03:45 oh, and,
01:03:47 I, this is,
01:03:48 so, you know the real reason
01:03:49 why this video is eight hours long?
01:03:51 Cause he spends,
01:03:52 he spends the majority of it
01:03:54 reading tweets.
01:03:56 Oh God,
01:03:57 it's just like J.K. Rowling's new book.
01:03:58 It's just like J.K. Rowling's new book
01:04:00 of fake meme tweets.
01:04:02 He,
01:04:03 he spends so much fucking time
01:04:04 in the video
01:04:05 reading every single,
01:04:06 and I'm not lying when I say
01:04:07 he reads every single
01:04:09 negative tweet about NFT.
01:04:10 While watching the video,
01:04:11 I was trying to pay attention
01:04:12 to see if he would
01:04:13 read one of my,
01:04:14 my tweets.
01:04:15 Cause I left a couple of stuff
01:04:16 that he,
01:04:17 like in the same style of like
01:04:18 tweets he's reading.
01:04:19 And there's like so many,
01:04:20 like I,
01:04:21 I,
01:04:22 I noticed there was a lot like
01:04:23 of people,
01:04:24 a lot of like my mutuals
01:04:25 or other like people that I know
01:04:26 that tweets he was reading
01:04:27 off of,
01:04:28 you know?
01:04:29 And like,
01:04:30 he wouldn't just read it.
01:04:31 He would also read
01:04:32 how many retweets
01:04:33 and how many likes.
01:04:34 There's like two moments
01:04:35 where he says that like
01:04:36 the NFT hate campaign
01:04:37 is so bad.
01:04:39 Because,
01:04:40 one of his,
01:04:41 two of his followers like
01:04:42 ratioed him one time.
01:04:44 Which is like,
01:04:45 this is like,
01:04:46 why would he bring this up?
01:04:47 What is,
01:04:48 why do you bring a thing
01:04:49 to get fucking ratioed
01:04:50 by your own followers, dude?
01:04:52 That's fucking cringe.
01:04:54 That's very funny.
01:04:56 That's the cringe you shit ever.
01:04:58 And he fucking,
01:04:59 and he complains about people
01:05:00 like being like follow police,
01:05:02 like,
01:05:03 oh there's people out there
01:05:04 who check to see if you follow
01:05:05 NFT artists.
01:05:06 But he's fucking being like,
01:05:07 he's being like the,
01:05:08 the Twitter like
01:05:09 Gestapo right now,
01:05:10 like fucking,
01:05:12 cause he like,
01:05:13 when he talks about
01:05:14 Robert Ross,
01:05:15 it's not that he,
01:05:16 the whole like framing it,
01:05:17 that Robert Ross started
01:05:18 like the hate campaign,
01:05:19 but he also
01:05:20 like goes to check to see,
01:05:21 like,
01:05:22 what are the tweets
01:05:23 that Robert Ross likes?
01:05:24 He only likes the anti-NFT tweets.
01:05:27 He's just retweeting anti-NFT stuff.
01:05:29 He's following the wrong people.
01:05:31 He's liking the wrong things.
01:05:32 Yes.
01:05:33 Oh, well,
01:05:34 mutuals with Hasan,
01:05:36 red flag right there.
01:05:39 Yeah, yeah.
01:05:40 And that's like another
01:05:41 fucking real point
01:05:42 he brings up later.
01:05:43 And Hasan is a lefty
01:05:44 and the left has a problem
01:05:45 because they bully NFT people.
01:05:46 Yeah.
01:05:47 And I know that because Ross did it
01:05:48 and Ross likes Hasan
01:05:49 and Hasan is left
01:05:50 and left is bad
01:05:51 because Ross bullies
01:05:52 NFT people.
01:05:53 And I know that the left
01:05:54 does that because
01:05:55 Ross follows Hasan.
01:05:57 You see,
01:05:58 it all comes together.
01:06:00 A big reason why
01:06:01 like I wanted to finish the video
01:06:02 because at the start of the video
01:06:03 he mentions,
01:06:04 he mentions an agenda
01:06:06 and I was like,
01:06:07 oh man,
01:06:08 now I got to really know
01:06:09 like who's the secret
01:06:10 fucking anti-NFT illuminati
01:06:12 he's talking about.
01:06:13 Uh-huh.
01:06:14 But he just reveals
01:06:15 that it's like lefties.
01:06:16 He even does like a montage
01:06:17 of different like anti-NFT tweets
01:06:19 mentioning capitalism.
01:06:21 Uh-oh.
01:06:22 And it's like...
01:06:23 Scary.
01:06:24 Like it's like he,
01:06:26 he doesn't realize that
01:06:27 it is capital,
01:06:28 like it is capitalism.
01:06:29 It especially NFTs
01:06:30 are very late stage capitalism
01:06:32 because like,
01:06:33 like capitalism would be like,
01:06:35 you're trying to make as much profit
01:06:36 off of like a physical object
01:06:38 that like serves a purpose
01:06:40 in a way, right?
01:06:41 Right.
01:06:42 And late stage capitalism would be
01:06:43 like you're trying to make as much
01:06:44 money off something
01:06:46 that doesn't-
01:06:47 No matter what it is,
01:06:48 just make that money.
01:06:49 Yeah.
01:06:50 Like it does,
01:06:51 it's not even like an object.
01:06:52 It's like,
01:06:53 it's just an idea of something.
01:06:54 So what,
01:06:55 does he,
01:06:56 yeah,
01:06:57 what does he think the difference
01:06:58 between this and
01:06:59 capital,
01:07:00 I mean,
01:07:01 he likes,
01:07:02 first of all,
01:07:03 he likes capitalism.
01:07:04 He thinks it's good.
01:07:05 So does,
01:07:06 but he doesn't think the NFTs are
01:07:07 a branch or a,
01:07:09 what's the word,
01:07:10 a manifestation of capitalism.
01:07:11 Does he think it's better
01:07:12 than capitalism?
01:07:13 He might,
01:07:14 he frames NFTs,
01:07:15 some sort of like
01:07:16 natural progressive
01:07:17 progression
01:07:18 Yeah.
01:07:19 of like stuff that like
01:07:20 already exists.
01:07:21 Yeah.
01:07:22 That's the problem.
01:07:23 It's a natural progression
01:07:24 of a bad system
01:07:25 that encourages bad things
01:07:26 to happen.
01:07:27 And there is,
01:07:28 for it's bad.
01:07:29 Well,
01:07:30 he sees them as
01:07:31 inevitable.
01:07:32 Yes.
01:07:33 That's part of the inevitable
01:07:34 march of progress.
01:07:35 He's like,
01:07:36 just part of the,
01:07:37 the natural part of the market,
01:07:38 you know,
01:07:39 the free,
01:07:40 the fucking free market.
01:07:41 I have a feeling that like,
01:07:43 tell me if you ever met
01:07:44 this kind of person.
01:07:45 There's like a,
01:07:46 there's like people out there
01:07:47 that are like pro capitalism,
01:07:48 but they don't know
01:07:49 what capitalism is.
01:07:50 Like what they think
01:07:51 capitalism is,
01:07:52 is like when you buy
01:07:53 and sell things.
01:07:54 Yeah.
01:07:55 Yes.
01:07:56 And I,
01:07:57 I had a buddy who I asked him,
01:07:58 dude,
01:07:59 because he was defending
01:08:00 capitalism.
01:08:01 Do you know what it is?
01:08:02 And he's like,
01:08:03 yeah, it's when you buy
01:08:04 and sell things.
01:08:05 And I'm like,
01:08:06 no, that's not fucking
01:08:07 capitalism.
01:08:08 That's commerce.
01:08:09 Yeah.
01:08:10 There's mercantilism existed before.
01:08:12 Yeah.
01:08:13 Like just buying and selling shit.
01:08:14 It's just,
01:08:15 it's always fucking
01:08:16 is the fucking the,
01:08:18 the,
01:08:19 uh,
01:08:20 what do you call it?
01:08:21 The incentive structure
01:08:22 that leads to
01:08:24 billionaires existing.
01:08:26 The existence of an owning,
01:08:27 an owning class,
01:08:28 a class that owns the,
01:08:30 the means of production,
01:08:31 the bourgeoisie
01:08:32 defined by,
01:08:33 defined by their ownership.
01:08:35 Yeah.
01:08:36 And he's basically saying that
01:08:37 like you see lefties,
01:08:39 like would say stuff like,
01:08:41 uplift,
01:08:42 uh,
01:08:43 black,
01:08:44 black voices.
01:08:45 But, but then like,
01:08:46 I hate it when people do that.
01:08:47 But,
01:08:48 but then when like black people
01:08:49 say like,
01:08:50 when black people are anti-vaccine,
01:08:52 fucking Hassan is like angry at them.
01:08:54 And like,
01:08:55 I'm going to say this,
01:08:56 the only reason people call Hassan,
01:08:58 the only reason people consider
01:09:00 Turkish people white is
01:09:01 because they hate Hassan.
01:09:02 I'm going to say that right now.
01:09:05 Wait,
01:09:06 I know,
01:09:07 I know Turkish people.
01:09:08 So they're saying he's white,
01:09:09 because they hate,
01:09:10 okay, sure.
01:09:11 Well, well,
01:09:12 Turkish people are like,
01:09:13 very light-skinned.
01:09:14 From what I've seen,
01:09:15 they seem very light-skinned.
01:09:16 Um,
01:09:17 I thought Turkey was more deserty,
01:09:18 but like,
01:09:19 what do I know?
01:09:20 Freaking, uh,
01:09:21 Johnny Depp looks less white
01:09:22 than Hassan does.
01:09:23 Johnny Depp is more of a PO.
01:09:24 I can't believe white woman,
01:09:26 Amber heard,
01:09:27 was frightening POC,
01:09:28 Johnny Depp,
01:09:29 taking away his fucking job.
01:09:31 True.
01:09:32 His livelihood,
01:09:33 threatening his livelihood.
01:09:35 He, he,
01:09:36 he basically does,
01:09:37 he basically does the thing where like,
01:09:39 um,
01:09:40 throughout the whole video,
01:09:41 he's saying that he's like,
01:09:42 pro-nuance.
01:09:43 Like he's,
01:09:44 he's, he has the nuance.
01:09:45 I consider myself
01:09:46 pro-nuance.
01:09:47 I'm pro-facts.
01:09:48 I'm pro-the-truth.
01:09:49 Yeah.
01:09:50 And anyway,
01:09:51 here's why,
01:09:52 here's why NFTs are inevitable
01:09:54 and why.
01:09:55 Are better,
01:09:56 better than unions.
01:09:57 Here's why,
01:09:58 here's why,
01:09:59 uh,
01:10:00 Amber heard is a white woman
01:10:01 attacking a BIPOC Johnny Depp.
01:10:03 Uh, anyway.
01:10:04 Yeah.
01:10:05 Okay.
01:10:06 I also consider myself pro-nuance.
01:10:08 He,
01:10:09 he considers himself pro-nuance,
01:10:10 but he does,
01:10:11 he thinks that like,
01:10:12 I'm pro-nouns.
01:10:13 He,
01:10:14 he thinks that lefties are hypocrites
01:10:16 when they like,
01:10:17 criticize bad ideas
01:10:18 that come from like,
01:10:19 POC.
01:10:20 When,
01:10:21 like,
01:10:22 it's like,
01:10:23 you understand that maybe there's some nuance here,
01:10:25 that maybe,
01:10:26 no,
01:10:27 when a black person,
01:10:28 like,
01:10:29 he brings up a guy called Thomas,
01:10:31 uh,
01:10:32 I think his name is Thomas Soho.
01:10:33 Oh, I know.
01:10:34 He's like a,
01:10:35 he's like a famous black, uh,
01:10:36 economist, right?
01:10:37 Yeah.
01:10:38 Yeah.
01:10:39 Economist.
01:10:40 And,
01:10:41 and he,
01:10:42 because he talks about,
01:10:43 like,
01:10:44 this is the part where he's just shitting on,
01:10:45 like,
01:10:46 lefties that he has.
01:10:47 Like,
01:10:48 he's not even like,
01:10:49 talking about NFTs anymore.
01:10:50 He's like,
01:10:51 just shitting on lefties.
01:10:52 Does he do a,
01:10:53 does he do a,
01:10:54 does he do a,
01:10:55 does he do a,
01:10:56 does he do a,
01:10:57 and another thing,
01:10:58 what if a black person made NFTs?
01:10:59 Wouldn't it be racist
01:11:00 to be mad about it?
01:11:01 Oh,
01:11:02 you,
01:11:03 oh,
01:11:04 I'm just saying that like,
01:11:05 the,
01:11:06 the blackutta
01:11:07 Republican's were more offensive than anything Hitler ever said about Jews,
01:11:08 in my opinion,
01:11:09 but replaced Jews with NFT artists.
01:11:10 And,
01:11:11 not surprisingly
01:11:12 There's like,
01:11:13 I'm not joking when I say this.
01:11:14 There's the dream,
01:11:15 there's the three minute section of the eight hour video where he's like defending Clarence Thomas.
01:11:19 What?
01:11:20 What the fuck!
01:11:21 Yes.
01:11:22 That's a good idea.
01:11:24 He's one of the,
01:11:25 he's the black guy on the Supreme court.
01:11:28 He's one of the ones he voted in favor of repealing.
01:11:31 Oh,
01:11:32 that,
01:11:33 That guy wait, what is he? I want to know what does he have to say about Clarence Thomas?
01:11:37 Well, he doesn't like that a bunch of liberals called him like the n-word like
01:11:42 You know what you know what I'll you know what I'll give it to him. You know what?
01:11:46 I'm defending like I I mean I'm defending you're here to do you to officially defend click calling switch
01:11:52 I switch sides now. Okay, but another
01:11:56 I'm allowed to say am I allowed to say the C word
01:11:58 Is it a color where no the seat C o and the word the word for a the word for a black person who?
01:12:05 undermines other black people for
01:12:08 No, I wouldn't say that Ben. You know, I probably I won't say it. I don't say
01:12:12 I know what you mean. I know what you mean. See C o and the word that got that never knows best video about
01:12:19 dragon age taken down because the
01:12:23 Because because the Coon the the code of conduct
01:12:28 Spelled Q you and sounded too much like the word Nick got flagged for eight speed
01:12:32 Then you gotta need like you can't be saying that you haven't had like a black guest on this show for ten years
01:12:38 I didn't I was I said the Q version
01:12:43 I pronounced it with the short double O sound
01:12:48 The difference between a cook and cook look I
01:12:53 Silent hard are all right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's right
01:12:58 But the thing is that I cut this whole part. No, it's good. No, I'm pro nuance. This is new
01:13:04 He conflates liberals with lefties, which is like big mistake right there
01:13:09 Well, yeah, I mean everybody on the right does that everybody on the right doesn't understand that they're not the same thing
01:13:14 I mean like the thing is that it's the same with him like conflating Twitter as a person
01:13:19 Which is why no, that's the only way Twitter
01:13:22 He's conflating NFTs with art as well
01:13:26 Yes, very pro very pro nuanced position this guy has
01:13:30 Yes, very good. Oh my god
01:13:33 Okay, well, I think one one final thing one one fucking one fucking final thing and then we could move on from the unique
01:13:40 The unique name of sore is shitty now or right? Um, he he complains, you know the artist. I'm RJ Palmer
01:13:48 Yeah, the Bulbasaur guy. Yeah. Yeah, he did like the realistic Pokemon
01:13:53 And then he ended up working on the technically true. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes
01:13:58 So, um, anyway, he he frames like RJ Palmer as kind of like a hypocrite because um,
01:14:04 He did tweet out that like he's all like, hey guys, maybe like the massive harassment campaigns against like
01:14:10 NFT artists is it like maybe we maybe like, you know, NFTs fucking suck
01:14:15 But like maybe they don't deserve a difference. Yeah, I mean that seems fair
01:14:20 I am not yeah, I'm not
01:14:23 I'm not I don't I don't hate into individual small artists for doing what they do to make money
01:14:29 I cannot begrudge them that I don't hate them. I mean, I don't hate like anyone who I don't hate any small artists who tried it
01:14:37 And then like yeah, stop doing it. Yeah
01:14:40 Especially become from a third world country because at that point fuck it right, right?
01:14:45 Yeah, that that being said RJ Palmer made that tweet and then a bunch of people in the replies were like
01:14:50 Nah, dude, fuck NFT artists, right? And the thing is that RJ Palmer had no pushback against us, right?
01:14:57 Like he didn't like he didn't he didn't push back against the people saying nah, dude. Fuck that. Yeah
01:15:01 He didn't push back any any frames is as like what the fuck RJ like you're fucking cultivating this like hate
01:15:08 This hate because he because he said don't harass people
01:15:12 But he didn't back it up hard enough. And so he actually said the opposite of what he said
01:15:17 This is the weird thing there is awesome like like a a bit of an argument and
01:15:23 An argument I shouldn't say a bit because it is that like people
01:15:29 Go to harassment way too easily and way too hard and in large numbers as it often is with something like Twitter
01:15:36 It's very damaging
01:15:38 So like it's not good that people go on a harassment campaigns thinking that they're the only one doing it not realizing
01:15:43 It was like huge amounts if it's like a big like all the Twitter enemy of the week
01:15:48 I and somebody gets dogpiled and it's like that aspect of it is like it's something to discuss
01:15:53 There's nuance in that you can't make a whole eight hour video about just that though
01:15:58 He sure they didn't I think my problem is that he frames this as like an art Twitter problem
01:16:04 Or like as a lefty problem when like it's a social media
01:16:07 This is just a Twitter problem the thing is Twitter is designed to piss you off like that
01:16:10 That's our purpose and he doesn't consider that
01:16:13 There's so many things he just doesn't consider it because he comes into everything with bad faith like for example
01:16:19 Though the one guy that supposedly like Sarah like stole art from like he clarified that he thinks that Sarah does not deserve
01:16:28 The hate campaign and both pan pizza and Ross did not tweet the clarification tweet
01:16:33 So he so he makes it seem like Ross is like this evil person for not doing that when he doesn't consider that maybe it
01:16:40 Just didn't show up on Ross's fucking timeline
01:16:42 Maybe like because Ross seems to be maybe only interacting with like hate hate NFT stuff
01:16:47 So that shit didn't pop up right he doesn't consider that just what maybe they didn't fucking see it
01:16:53 Maybe because a lot of big artists a lot of popular people will make a tweet and then mute it right away
01:16:58 Because their phone is gonna be constantly fucking ringing from the notifications
01:17:02 He does not consider none of these things
01:17:05 Right because everything is like it like everything has like an intent and not that like it's just like
01:17:11 This is a sad situation that the internet and Twitter and social media has brought us to where this happens too often and then too
01:17:18 Easily it is not the malicious intent of anyone in particular
01:17:23 So so he's mentioning anything. I mean, I know people who have large audiences should have like some
01:17:30 Understanding that when they say stuff and their followers like
01:17:34 Feel in power to do something that that might have some
01:17:38 like repercussions
01:17:40 But like I don't know. What did they even say that was so bad?
01:17:46 Like how could they have done it different say nothing I?
01:17:50 suppose
01:17:52 Yeah, like I think I mean even like I think no matter what RJ Palmer would have done like unique name of service would have like
01:17:58 Taken it as bad, right the fact that like RJ Palmer isn't pro NFT is a bad thing
01:18:05 right
01:18:07 Right, yeah, yeah
01:18:09 Yeah, so so for example, he hates that RJ Palmer like didn't do enough to like stop the campaign
01:18:15 But then later in the video he brings up that um that one black streamer that went into that like like the most racist town in the world
01:18:22 And like was talking to the Klans member and that Klans member was just telling him just awful shit
01:18:28 And he just let that slide
01:18:29 But he was kind of and but he framed the frames is as like
01:18:32 Cassana is an evil person for like criticizing that black guy who was letting this like Klans member say all his racist shit to him
01:18:40 Hmm, which is like do you not realize that like I mean the thing is that I'm basically saying that like
01:18:47 he's criticizing
01:18:49 RJ Palmer for like not doing enough to stop a
01:18:53 Harassment campaign, but he's not taking that same energy to like
01:18:57 This like this individual not like saying anything back to like a Klans member saying a bunch of racist shit to him, right?
01:19:04 right because
01:19:06 That video standard, right exactly he has like this double like the thing is that like and
01:19:11 This is kind of like a thing that like is very much pushed as an idea that lefties are like that lefties like
01:19:18 Present themselves as this like perfect being when I say like the majority of like lefties don't do that like majority of them
01:19:24 Like admit that their assholes and pieces of shit. I do that right like I'm like the untolerant left if you will right
01:19:32 But but the thing is that they keep like pushing this idea
01:19:35 So like anything like it like anything a lefty would do that's like considered negative or like push back against like a
01:19:42 protective class or whatnot is them being that they're instant. They're like
01:19:46 Participating and being a hypocrite, you know
01:19:48 So right so it's like a lefty. Oh
01:19:53 Lefties like things that are good, but in my opinion
01:19:57 one of them is something bad, so
01:20:00 It's so it's so weird because it's like it's like it's like you start starting from the point that like okay
01:20:06 Anything anything a lefty likes is something good, right? But I hate them
01:20:10 So let's so let's just but they're bad because not because they believe bad things or they want bad things
01:20:16 But because they fell short of the good things that they say that they like and that I should probably agree with them
01:20:24 about
01:20:26 But I hate them for it. Yeah, so yeah, so to clarify the video did not it did it did not fucking need all eight hours
01:20:34 Yeah, you repeat himself too much
01:20:37 He's reading too much
01:20:38 Pat had it out reads reading tweets. Yeah, right and like he did he said he did that
01:20:43 He did six months of research to prepare for this video and I'm saying just on Twitter
01:20:47 He should have done six more months because this shit is like fucking this, you know, this reminds me of that
01:20:55 I wrote you a five page letter if I had more time it would have been one
01:20:59 You know brevity is the soul of wit and I think if you maybe you should have worked harder
01:21:04 Not to make the video longer what to make it shorter
01:21:09 Where it won't be pat it's where it won't be a waste of time
01:21:13 So I have to I gotta go somewhere like real quick right now. Are you guys gonna still be recorded in 30 minutes?
01:21:19 minutes probably
01:21:22 30 an hour and a half in well like if you guys aren't recording by the time I get back whatever but
01:21:27 I mean you cut out this whole part or let's sink. Let's we didn't sink at the beginning
01:21:32 Right now on the count of three say sink one two three sink. Thank all right
01:21:40 We will probably still be going in half an hour. I think I
01:21:44 Wanted to ask about that the the black guy going into the racist area because that seemed interesting
01:21:51 Was that do you know what that is? Oh, no, I wasn't familiar with that
01:21:55 Okay, I guess I'll wait until cheesy. Did he say it was a video of Hassan talking to a racist
01:22:01 No, a black guy who got accosted by a racist guy or was that it was
01:22:06 What I assume is that Hassan watched a video in which a black guy goes to the most racist town in America and walks up to
01:22:12 Clans members, right seems like a bit that he's doing in that video. Yeah, and
01:22:17 Hassan
01:22:19 Criticized the black guy because of court like oh if you go there, of course something's gonna happen
01:22:23 And you need to do that for us criticize Hassan right? Okay, and but he didn't criticize the black guy for
01:22:31 Jumping into a lion's den I suppose. Mmm. I would like to see that video. That seems interesting. That seems like a weird bit
01:22:37 It is a weird bit. Yeah, I I'm not
01:22:41 Yeah, I don't know I have to see it. Oh man. I just shit
01:22:44 I just remembered a bunch of stuff that I did last night that I forgot about you. Oh do tell do tell
01:22:51 Spill the beans. No, I smoked a cigarette. Oh, no
01:22:54 My god forgot I smoked a cigarette last night give
01:22:58 God's gonna be angry at me
01:23:01 All the cigarette comedians are laughing
01:23:04 They've been waiting
01:23:05 Darn, I forgot. Oh man. Yeah, I thought we were going home
01:23:09 I remember we stopped at a at a bar that I forgot we went to
01:23:13 Who did you go out with so what was what was going on? It was my um, it was a
01:23:18 My friend, uh, well on the internet. He's known as Dwoob. Oh, yeah
01:23:22 Yeah, and when I had not seen him in a while. I went over to his house to catch up
01:23:27 With another friend that they're the three of us had gone to college together. So
01:23:34 Yeah, that's that's that's and they they led you astray they made you they gave you a cigarette
01:23:41 They throw they totally did they liquored you up and gave you a cigarette and you just puffed away
01:23:46 Oh, I could not consent to smoke that cigarette. I could not give informed enthusiastic consent
01:23:52 Uh
01:23:56 Well, I'm unholy I'm sully
01:24:01 Yeah gross you got to smoke a holy water cigarette. I don't I don't smoke anymore
01:24:06 But I guess some I guess if I drink sometimes I do and I gotta put holy water in a vape and I think I'm okay
01:24:12 That's how you undo it. Oh
01:24:16 Yeah, I guess you could do that. Can you just vape water? Does it just turn into steam?
01:24:21 There's a break your or that break your what's what's the mechanics of a vape pen?
01:24:25 So that does it just is a heat thing and it just yeah vaporizes the stuff. Yes, it's a tiny nozzle
01:24:31 It's an induction coil what there is is there is a wire with their high resistance. There's a resistance
01:24:37 There's a an electricity resistant wire that is in a coil and the coil goes around a piece of cotton
01:24:43 Which is called the wick and the wick absorbs liquid
01:24:46 And so the portion of the cotton that is between the coil gets heated by the inductance of the current and
01:24:54 That and that vaporizes the liquid that it has absorbed
01:24:58 That's how it works. So yeah, I guess you could probably do it with water it might holy water
01:25:04 Potentially once it once it went dry it would start to burn
01:25:08 So you have to be careful with that
01:25:11 Yeah, you could do it just you could vape holy steam. No problem. You know what I'm sure people have done it
01:25:18 Yeah, I ordered Chinese food while cheesy was talking so that'll be that'll be here in 10 minutes
01:25:26 for breakfast
01:25:29 It's it's it's past noon already for me. Oh, yeah, I guess although I've only been up since 11
01:25:37 Um
01:25:38 To Ben at September
01:25:41 Yeah, that means this Halloween
01:25:44 true, I guess it it literally like the day after I moved
01:25:49 It went from being like hot summer to being like now. It's now. It's cool out
01:25:55 The season changed at the very at the very moment. Oh
01:25:59 Man, my new room is so much nicer than my old one my old one sucks so bad
01:26:04 It was so disgusting you saw the yeah, I saw I saw your old room
01:26:08 You really didn't want me to go in there, but I had to look I had to know where Ben saying I didn't want you to see it
01:26:14 Because it's embarrassing and it's gross and I even I know like this is bad and it reflects poorly on me that I live here
01:26:22 But now in your brand-new room
01:26:24 The cockroaches they're they're they're polished. They're they're gleaming. I did see I did see an ant
01:26:30 I never had ants at the old place. I did see one ant, which is a bit concerning. I hope I don't see any more of those
01:26:38 Ants aren't so bad. I well, I do. I mean they're they're
01:26:43 What are they gonna do pick you up with their like strength? It was a bit. It was one of the big ants. I don't like that
01:26:51 I mean, whatever. I guess they're just a
01:26:55 The fact of life, I mean if you find their ant hill you can just pour molten metal down there
01:27:00 The old making art sculpture the old place did not have cockroaches, but it had mice everywhere. I
01:27:06 Never said well
01:27:07 I never saw a mouse in my room until I was moving and then as I was packing boxes in and around the time
01:27:13 I was recording the video. I did finally see one mouse in my room and I was like, oh there it is there
01:27:20 There's the it's been there the whole time. It might have been
01:27:23 I don't you know what I think it was because the last couple weeks
01:27:26 I was there my friggin old landlord was sending these work guys in to do like renovations and they cut
01:27:32 The radiator out of my wall and there was just a hole in the floor and the ceiling where the radiator tube
01:27:37 I think the mouse might have crawled in through the friggin hole in the floor that the radiator used to connect to
01:27:42 That might have been how it got in just at the very end there
01:27:45 That's just a theory
01:27:48 Anyway, that was gross I saw that as shit
01:27:51 That's the one thing it's pests in pests in the kitchen. I can ignore them pests in my room
01:27:56 That's what if they crawl on me while I'm asleep
01:27:58 So I didn't didn't like you got to get spiders in there to catch them
01:28:03 There were some there were unironically having a spider in your room is good because yeah
01:28:10 The most annoying thing is things flying and things crawling and spiders just sit in the corner
01:28:15 I what yeah, I was putting up a tapestry
01:28:18 I was putting up my cop killers tapestry actually and I was reaching up into the corner
01:28:23 And there was a little spider in up in the ceiling corner and it's a hot tall ceiling
01:28:28 So I hadn't noticed it before and I briefly considered killing it. I was like no, it's probably gonna
01:28:35 Remove more pests than killing this spider would
01:28:38 Would do I could remove the one spider now or I could let it remove future small insects for me
01:28:44 So I just let it be. Yeah, so it's a guard. Yeah, I think it was the right. I think it was the right choice
01:28:53 I'm hungover we'll hungover and I feel a little bit bad, but not so bad. I'm recovering
01:29:01 I ordered some more I'm almost out of corn fiber for gummies. I've almost used up the last of it
01:29:06 I need to get shelf space. I need I need to claim some shelf space
01:29:10 For my stuff there are shelves down in the kitchen and I think they are labeled with like previous roommates names
01:29:17 And I think if I maybe if I hurry if I rush I can claim some of those throughout some of that person's old stuff
01:29:23 And take that shelf space for myself. They get a lot of shit. We got a lot of gummy shit
01:29:27 They need yeah kitchen real estate for
01:29:31 Yeah, could you padlock it could you install a little padlock?
01:29:35 No, these are the shelves here. Well, the shelves I'm talking about are just they don't have doors on them
01:29:40 They're just at the end of a little like quarter. There's just like some open shelves
01:29:45 Which is kind of bad because I would sort of prefer them to be sealed away. So as like
01:29:50 You know like a bag of sugar. I'd rather be inside something to further protect against like flies getting into it or whatever
01:29:56 I guess put a bag of sugar in a tupperware. Yeah, I just have to make sure that they're sealed pretty pretty tight. That's all
01:30:05 But I'm
01:30:07 Feeling good
01:30:09 Feel good. I lit. It's it's improved my mood
01:30:12 I think not to live in a dingy in a dingy cave and it's stained fucking dirty
01:30:18 Falling apart piece of shit
01:30:20 Well, I'm glad. I am glad. I feel happy
01:30:25 I guess we should talk about I mean, do you want to say anything about the tricksy quitting YouTube?
01:30:32 I feel like we should acknowledge it. Oh, we already did but like I don't know what it what it my thoughts on it is
01:30:40 She's gonna come back. Yeah
01:30:43 With some like retiring the channel. I
01:30:49 Mean, obviously she wasn't making a lot of money a lot of views from those videos. Yeah, I didn't really watch the video
01:30:56 I somebody summarized it
01:30:58 What I guess it's just like yeah, no, I mean, this isn't you this is yeah
01:31:05 She she's she has no intentions of getting a different job like a more like traditional job
01:31:10 So I'm sure some sort of internet thing is gonna happen. Well, she said she'll be working working for mint salad now
01:31:17 Doing what I don't editing her videos. I guess I
01:31:21 Can't imagine how that pays for anything but
01:31:27 Whatever
01:31:28 Yeah, she will she will figure out that yeah, a real job is actually hard and
01:31:34 That YouTube money was easier and she will she will be back
01:31:39 The thing the thing with yeah, that the mint thing is not gonna work out ASC presents is not gonna
01:31:45 Pay the bills that whole thing is gonna fall. I give it to I give it two months. I give it two months before that whole living situation
01:31:53 Implodes and then she'll be back
01:31:56 But man, what I just want to say what a what a stupid
01:32:01 The whole the vlog is thing. I think that like probably I hadn't not on my radar at all
01:32:06 I had no idea what's been going on
01:32:08 so I had I had seen the announcement that she was gonna do the month of vlogs and then an announcement at the end and I think that I
01:32:16 Think I don't know it seems to me like the vlog is was actually sort of a last-ditch attempt to like generate interest to like get
01:32:23 The channel back on track
01:32:24 So I think that maybe if that had happened the announcement would not have been I'm quitting but because it did not work
01:32:30 She quit but like if so what a
01:32:33 Vlog is was not good one. She didn't even stick to it. She did not post a video every day
01:32:38 She missed several days and two like the stuff she posted was like the laziest like most slapdash stuff like there was nothing
01:32:46 There was nothing impressive like it was it was not much of a
01:32:49 Hail Mary, you know, I mean
01:32:51 It's it's been obvious that her heart is not in it
01:32:56 Has been not in it for a very long time. That's I mean, yeah, the last thing she was excited about
01:33:01 I think was the doing rap gigs and she did one or two. Yeah
01:33:07 You mean the real the real life ones. Yeah, they're going to a real life and doing a rap or two. Yeah
01:33:12 And as I said, yeah
01:33:15 She's I mean, she's clearly more about she's clearly more interested in
01:33:19 Wrapping that which is fun. That's fun
01:33:23 Yeah, whatever. Yeah, it's just old news like the the the I'm quitting seems more like clickbait
01:33:30 Than yeah, it doesn't seem like it's an like a notable occurrence. I
01:33:36 I
01:33:37 Yeah, I would have I guess I would agree with that
01:33:40 It's it's just sort of a what do you what do you what would I call it? It's just sort of a it's just sort of saying out loud
01:33:46 Yeah, what has kind of just been
01:33:48 Implicit for a while. I guess that's true
01:33:52 Yeah, okay. Well, I think it's funny. I had a good chuckle over it
01:33:57 when the video dropped and
01:33:59 Yeah
01:34:01 Someone someone said I think people thought we were gonna talk a lot about it
01:34:05 Somebody said like oh Ben's gonna Ben's gonna spite. Yeah, the fight so much for the notes for the notes for this episode
01:34:12 I don't have much of my own, but I did type Ben is gonna talk about Trixie. That's all I've got on my notes
01:34:19 Well, I was assuming you would like have a big haha. I like I do I think I think you've already done that
01:34:25 I think your your ha ha has already
01:34:27 Yeah, come and gone. Yeah, there's not yeah, I've said everything that I really have to say about it at this point
01:34:34 I just uh
01:34:35 Do I did want to acknowledge I did want to acknowledge to anyone who was wondering? Yes, I did see the video. Yes
01:34:41 It is funny. Yes, I did
01:34:43 Kill her it I did this is my doing. Yes
01:34:50 So, you know good good week good week for me
01:34:55 Did I really film that video in the same I filmed that yeah
01:34:58 Yeah, and you film the videos and I moved into a good house. Oh my god. It's a red
01:35:03 I mean moving is a whole big thing. You've probably been like
01:35:08 Going all over the place for the past few days
01:35:11 Yeah, so it feels like a lot of stuff has happened, which it has it has for me
01:35:16 Nothing happened. No, it's fine. A lot a lot of
01:35:19 I'm amazed. I'm amazed that so much. I
01:35:23 genuinely thought that like
01:35:25 the recording had been
01:35:27 Last week and I had talked about it already on the show, but I guess I did not so that's very
01:35:33 Funny, I'm watching my my door-dash delivery driver
01:35:37 I'm watching the little red dot crawl across the the Google Maps and approach my house
01:35:41 He's he's three minutes away, and you know what? I think I lost. Oh my god. No. No. Oh, no
01:35:47 I accidentally ordered the tofu. I meant to get the chicken, but I ordered the tofu. I'm so stupid
01:35:52 I'm such a fucking dweeb
01:35:54 I don't like tofu. It's mediocre
01:35:56 This is this is this is a karma Ben. It's me. I'm trying to see ah
01:36:02 So the soul
01:36:07 Know what that means
01:36:11 Well, you pay
01:36:12 All right, he is he's out. He's okay. He's he's almost here. He's outside my door
01:36:17 He's surely probably getting out of the car right now
01:36:22 He's oh my god, I'm attention
01:36:26 Do you hear the footsteps? I do not I do not hear the footsteps
01:36:31 I'm waiting for the little I'm waiting for the map to update and say deliver
01:36:39 I don't want to start like a thing and then have you know I gotta go eat I gotta go do that
01:36:44 You know what open the door. I think okay, I've got to go grab it from downstairs. I'll be back in a second
01:36:53 Okay, I'm back
01:36:57 What else
01:37:01 I
01:37:03 Guess I'm
01:37:06 If there's anything to talk about is that I'm trying to get more productive and it's difficult not
01:37:13 Shitting on yourself. Oh, yeah, you're always you're always trying to be productive. What's up with that?
01:37:19 Because we're always always trying to do things and I'm trying to be pro
01:37:25 Actionate the pro duck the product inators the productionators. Yeah
01:37:31 Because like September in my head was like, okay
01:37:35 September is gonna be my
01:37:37 Working on Clarissa getting that done
01:37:40 I still have these commissions to do. I still have a few load of ghosts books to send off
01:37:45 That have been returned and I just haven't got around to those things and like
01:37:50 my my default like reaction to wasted time is to shit on myself and
01:37:56 to be like very
01:37:58 Like realist but like harsh God, it's so it's so mid. It's so mid. It sucks. I hate
01:38:06 And and it's so difficult to like balance
01:38:09 your your realist like production
01:38:13 like
01:38:14 Like your work ethic stuff, you've got to be serious. You've got to be sensible
01:38:20 you've got to treat the work with respect and not slack off, but I can't like
01:38:28 Depress myself because that's also bad
01:38:31 It's difficult trying to figure out the the perfect balance because I want to when you say depress yourself
01:38:37 What do you mean by that?
01:38:38 to to like, I don't know
01:38:40 trigger depressive triggered triggered
01:38:44 mood by like so I
01:38:47 by by
01:38:50 Like giving myself a hard time instead of being more optimistic about doing better in the future
01:38:57 I feel like if I just say every time like oh, well, I didn't work today, but I'll try next day
01:39:04 I'll do better later. I feel like that it feels a little too insincere
01:39:08 I I
01:39:10 Gravitate to wanting to be more harsh like no, this is not acceptable. You got to do better
01:39:15 But I don't want to hurt myself. I don't want to bully myself
01:39:19 Because that has led to bad things you would bring what you don't want to
01:39:23 You don't want to do what rubber Ross did to that entity artist and make her kill herself
01:39:30 Yeah, even though she's fine. Yeah, I mean what I mean, I don't think we mentioned that
01:39:35 That nobody actually killed themselves right that whole thing. Well, it was just a potential
01:39:40 Yeah, nothing nothing actually happened. Nothing actually happened
01:39:43 Just this girl stopped posting and unique it was like what is she killed herself though? What if that happened?
01:39:49 It would be said that would be fucked up. Yeah
01:39:52 It'll be very fucked up wouldn't be Ross's fault, but yeah, it would be pretty fucked up. Yeah
01:39:58 So, I don't know I still I
01:40:00 I've I've made measures to make my my work day more like structured and in a way that I
01:40:08 Can like work with instead of like
01:40:11 You know when you wake up late and like some of the day is gone
01:40:15 Mm-hmm. Oh, I have less hours to work
01:40:19 This sucks and then it makes it harder to get out of bed
01:40:22 Yeah, then it would have been if you got up earlier the day's already wasted
01:40:26 Yeah, there's like things that it's like, okay, it doesn't matter when I start but from when I start
01:40:31 I have to do at least three hours then take a break for an hour
01:40:34 And then you know, whenever I end up wherever I end up, that's the end of my day
01:40:38 It's not like I'm not bound by the Sun. I can I can work around the Sun. It's fine
01:40:45 Yes, but but but it feels like even though you have the same, you know
01:40:49 14 or 16 hours awake or whatever, you know
01:40:53 It feels if it starts late if it starts late and ends late
01:40:56 It feels like less than if it starts early and ends. Yeah, and then it definitely feels amazing when you happen to wake up
01:41:04 And just get out of bed for I don't know you get out of bed to pee and then you're like, you know what this time
01:41:10 I'm not gonna go back into bed
01:41:11 I'm gonna do stuff and then it like it's your normal breakfast time
01:41:15 But you already had breakfast and you've done some work already. It's like wow
01:41:20 So good like it's the perfect thing
01:41:23 Getting out of bed is the hard part, but I think
01:41:26 Not shitting on yourself for not getting out of bed is also an important thing, right?
01:41:31 I mean when you do that you I'm trying to make it so that like no matter when I get out of bed the day starts
01:41:38 Even if I like open my phone, I look at a video that I don't even like looking at
01:41:43 So instead of for two hours and then get out of bed. I that's when the day starts
01:41:47 I mean, there's there's something to be said
01:41:49 For like if you
01:41:51 Recognize that like you feel better
01:41:54 When you wake up early
01:41:55 There's something to be said for okay. Well since I know that about myself. I should you know ensure that I wake up early
01:42:03 That makes me feel better. I guess it's also it's fine to also be like
01:42:07 Well, I should try to feel better even if I don't do that
01:42:11 I guess it's different two different approaches to solving those different approaches basically
01:42:16 The idea that I've been that I've been trying to work in it with is like
01:42:22 um
01:42:23 Having a schedule, but adjusting based on how I react to it
01:42:28 If it's going to lead to burnout, maybe I change
01:42:32 an aspect of it for the next day
01:42:34 And if it's too lenient maybe rain it in a bit and I don't know I'm just trying things
01:42:41 But I'm ultimately not getting a lot of work done
01:42:44 um
01:42:45 and it
01:42:47 Feels bad. Hmm. Can't really get away from the fact that it feels bad
01:42:52 that um
01:42:54 I don't know. I'm just I'm just am slow at creating things
01:42:59 Hmm
01:43:01 I'm slow at getting into a work groove
01:43:04 And it's difficult forcing myself to act in ways that I'm not used to
01:43:09 sure
01:43:10 um
01:43:11 That's my conundrum. Can you help do you think?
01:43:16 You said okay, so you're you're you say you're slow. Is that like
01:43:22 Do you think that is uh, uh
01:43:25 Like what do you
01:43:28 You mean like what are you stupid? Yeah, I mean is that like you mean just like when you work you do it
01:43:33 Slowly or do you mean you take a long time to
01:43:37 No, it's not that I'm slow to to doing something. It's not that that I'm slow particularly. It's that
01:43:42 um, I get very impatient and very antsy very often
01:43:46 So I could work for 40 minutes before I am like, ah, you got to do something else
01:43:50 I think that's normal
01:43:52 It's normal, but like it would be nice if I could work for two hours
01:43:55 And then that's more like that's a nicer rounder number is more you can do with the two hour window
01:44:01 But like if it turns out that my my
01:44:04 Break thing is like every 40 minutes. I need to take a break
01:44:07 I could try that. I think I should try that like more deliberately. I feel like yeah
01:44:11 I feel like if you find that that's the natural
01:44:15 Rhythm that you fall into
01:44:17 It might be worth. Yeah, just trying to structure your day and your time around that pattern
01:44:24 Uh
01:44:26 I think too large and there's yeah, there's something there's something to be said for just like knowing yourself
01:44:31 And rather than trying to like fix your
01:44:34 tendencies
01:44:35 Just try and yeah go with the flow. So yeah, go go with like structure myself
01:44:41 Structure my work day and my plans around the way that I naturally would do things
01:44:46 Yeah, as long as it doesn't mean I do nothing
01:44:49 So yeah, that I think I should do more frequent breaks
01:44:53 and less length
01:44:56 It's always sucks when you go on a break and you're like, ah, I'm on a break
01:45:00 Oh, it's over. No. No, I want the break to be an hour long two hours maybe
01:45:05 And then it's like well, then I'm working for 40 minutes and having a two hour break in between
01:45:10 It's like that's not gonna that's not gonna work long term. I need to change that
01:45:15 I need to be more
01:45:17 Gooder
01:45:18 right
01:45:20 Who doesn't
01:45:21 Sorry to not to be off topic, but
01:45:24 I feel good that when I think about the fact that I smoked that cigarette last night
01:45:28 I don't think like oh, it was good. I want another one. I think yeah, ill gross. Yeah, feels that is good. Yeah
01:45:35 You were fine. Would you say you were addicted? I mean most people who smoke I would say get a bit addicted at the very least
01:45:41 Yeah for a period there. Yeah, I would get some crave. I would crave it like a big oof a cigarette would feel good right now
01:45:48 I or like oh, I um
01:45:50 I want to go do that and I mean I would do it
01:45:52 There were periods, uh, where I would smoke basically every day although. I never was like a pack a day
01:45:58 Smoker I would generally smoke. Um, maybe a few a day. Maybe like
01:46:03 Six or eight at most, uh in a day. So I would say I had a bit of a
01:46:09 Yeah, I mean if you're getting cravings for it, you're a little addicted. So yeah for a while there
01:46:14 Not anymore though
01:46:16 Uh, it's literally the pandemic
01:46:18 The pandemic just made me not want to leave my house. So I didn't go and buy cigarette
01:46:23 Thanks, covet
01:46:25 Thank you, covet. Thank you. Kobe. You've done so much for us. Although
01:46:29 Damn, I saw an article
01:46:32 Wow, this tofu sucks
01:46:34 I saw an article that was like
01:46:36 Hey, so covet has made everybody sicker
01:46:39 Everybody has like worse
01:46:41 Lung and heart and brain issues now the whole population is sicker and they compared it like it's it says though everybody in the world
01:46:48 Took up smoking
01:46:50 It's like it's like it's like the entire population just started smoking cigarettes and now they are all smokers like that's the
01:46:57 The the the the damage to just health in general
01:47:01 That covet has done to the population. Maybe um aggregate
01:47:04 Do they mean like people who got the the pandemic the the the virus like before vaccines and survived, you know, I don't know
01:47:13 Yeah, I think there any difference. I would imagine that yeah
01:47:16 It probably is worse for people who got it before they were vaccinated worse for people who have gotten it multiple times
01:47:22 I'm sure that the damage is proportional to like how much covet have you had
01:47:27 uh
01:47:28 Because it's occasionally i'm like wow that was a long pause
01:47:32 Maybe I have covet brain fog, but I don't freak out about it for some reason. I'm just so like you know
01:47:37 I mean, I've always been kind of dumb
01:47:39 I've always been kind of slow. I freaked out about covet brain fog
01:47:43 The fact of the matter is that yeah, lots lots of things
01:47:46 cause what might be called brain damage
01:47:48 Uh, and such as using twitter such as using twitter such as eating soy
01:47:53 um
01:47:54 I'm doing right now. I'm getting brain fog. Just just just from the smell of this delicious tofu
01:48:00 and um
01:48:01 Yeah, I I when it yeah, sometimes I can't think of something and I think oh god is a brain fog
01:48:06 But then I'm like I I always was like that. I always had those moments. It's not weird
01:48:12 It's not a it's I don't think covet has changed my thought patterns in any meaningful way
01:48:17 So yeah normie, but like if it did
01:48:20 Then I mean I'd work with it
01:48:23 I I mean it's sort of
01:48:25 I'd have to work with it
01:48:26 But like it's the sort of thing that happens to
01:48:29 Most people at some age time in their life. Maybe just covet like oh if I'm like older
01:48:35 I get to like 60 and that starts happening because of age
01:48:39 um
01:48:41 Uh, the covet brain fog would have made it happen much earlier. Well, I mean that was 60 year olds are not completely out of
01:48:48 You know out of they're not completely palace. Yeah, I can do it
01:48:53 I can do it. There's no there's nothing to freak out about I suppose at least not for me
01:49:00 But it is a good excuse. It is a good excuse where I'm like sitting there and thinking
01:49:03 I gotta think of to I gotta do a work
01:49:07 I can't do it covet brain fog probably
01:49:10 Gotta be that fog. I I had you know what I had thoughts
01:49:14 Like that even before covet I would think like I would be sitting there and I would be thinking like
01:49:19 Why can't I do anything? Why am I so bad at everything? Why am I stupid?
01:49:24 Why am I such a failure? Is it am I just am I just dumb? Is there just something wrong with me?
01:49:30 um
01:49:31 So, you know
01:49:33 Now I can blame covet at least. Yeah
01:49:37 So um
01:49:39 Uh, I don't know that's really what's been going on in my mind. I I uh
01:49:45 The only thing I've been consistent with which is good is that my my workout regime regimen has been done
01:49:52 in
01:49:53 Like three times a week. That's good consistently since the beginning of july. So I'm not I'm not slipping
01:50:00 hmm
01:50:01 that's very good
01:50:02 Regardless of how good the workout is
01:50:05 I'm doing it when I have to do it and that's uh good
01:50:09 You know one of the friends I was hanging out with last night
01:50:12 Told me that they uh started a they started seeing a therapist. They got done. Um, I think it was it was well butrin
01:50:18 I think it was well butrin. They got on some kind of
01:50:22 Some kind of antidepressant medication and they said they started
01:50:25 They've started exercising. They've done a regimen and uh, I mean they had they had like just started so they couldn't really
01:50:32 I couldn't really evaluate like oh, yeah, they seem to be it seems to be improving their
01:50:37 life or whatever
01:50:38 But uh, I don't know
01:50:41 for people
01:50:42 Yeah, I mean exercise is good generally just to move your body around but um,
01:50:47 I don't know whether my workout is like strenuous enough
01:50:50 To be a very huge, but it's definitely a positive any any it's definitely a 80 20 even even a little bit is like a big
01:50:58 Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's good in that way physically
01:51:02 But it's also good knowing that I'm keeping up with that even if I'm like
01:51:06 Not creative some of the time I'm like, uh
01:51:11 I got I still have this lord of ghosts that has been sent back
01:51:15 I haven't done anything. It's still in like the the the packaging that they sent it back in like the
01:51:21 They ripped open the envelope and everything's fucked up
01:51:23 And I just didn't want to open it and figure out how to send it back
01:51:26 I've got terrible news terrible news one of the lord of ghosts a button eyes came off of his sheet
01:51:32 And I moved no he lost one of I still I have the the button
01:51:37 I mean came it was
01:51:39 It was hand stitched all every button. I know so there's this likely that will happen because it's okay a perfect sewer
01:51:47 It's okay
01:51:48 Because I minted him as an NFT and so even though he's been destroyed. I still nothing has changed
01:51:54 I still have the asset. I still control the asset. No, it's fine
01:51:58 um
01:52:02 What were you talking about? Oh, yeah, I have not been working out. I have been
01:52:06 Dieting I've been eating pretty clean and I have lost a lot of weight
01:52:08 And I'm I'm back down to the weight that I was when I was working out like two years ago
01:52:13 Even though I have not been so I guess I'm just skinny now
01:52:16 I mean, I'm not that skinny, but
01:52:19 Skinny by my standards
01:52:21 That's good. No, that's gooder. Mm-hmm
01:52:25 I just do this I have I just
01:52:27 Cycled between like weigh in like 160 and then I'll go up to like 200 and I'll lose it weight down to like 160
01:52:34 And I'm at the low point in my cycle and I hope I hope to keep it that way
01:52:38 I hope to hope to stay here this time
01:52:41 Well, it's time to go back up if you're at the lowest point. That's how curves work. Mm-hmm over time
01:52:46 It has to fluctuate the same amount
01:52:48 It's an infinite spiral. It's an infinite spiral just like DNA
01:52:52 You need to put on 40 pounds of just muscle
01:52:56 honestly
01:52:57 Honestly, absolutely. Honestly. I do need to do that. Yeah
01:53:02 That would rule
01:53:04 Eat a raw steak while bench pressing or whatever. Whatever it is you muscle heads do
01:53:13 All I would need all I would need to do all I would need to get back to lifting and I would need to just eat
01:53:18 More proteins. I already I already eat a lot of protein
01:53:21 I'm not keto anymore, but I do eat meat
01:53:25 Oh, just meat makes up a pretty high percentage of my diet anyway. So
01:53:30 I think I'm good on that
01:53:33 I realized I I have like a huge five pound bag of protein powder that I've like barely
01:53:38 used so
01:53:40 I just start using that
01:53:42 um
01:53:43 Ugh
01:53:46 I'm so disappointed. I'm so disappointed in this in this food anymore. I finish it
01:53:51 Sad just you save it for me. I'll come get it. Okay
01:53:56 Um
01:54:00 Uh, what?
01:54:03 We've been going for two hours. Okay. I'm trying to think if there's anything else
01:54:08 That I wanted to talk about. Oh shit
01:54:11 I didn't I didn't tweet ask pcp
01:54:15 this week
01:54:17 Should I do that now? It may as well. All right
01:54:22 I feel like people
01:54:24 We're not gonna miss out on that much. No, not really. I meant to
01:54:28 I I said I would uh fix the
01:54:32 The speak pipe after I moved well, I have moved and I haven't done it
01:54:35 But I mean I just didn't hear about two days
01:54:38 So this this week I will try and uh and do that
01:54:43 Someone just
01:54:45 Someone just added
01:54:47 the pcp account
01:54:50 And said fool. Oh wait, they were adding
01:54:53 My meaty last week saying I didn't fix the voicemails yet. They said
01:54:57 Phobos Roblo says fool at me
01:55:01 Through um
01:55:05 Oh, I guess I can say um, uh my runescape adventure
01:55:10 I have been mining iron still, but I'm very close to level 85 mining
01:55:15 I'm like
01:55:16 eight
01:55:17 Or seven hours of mining away from getting 85 mining, which means I'll be able to mine runeitor
01:55:24 Which is the best or because it's blue-ish. It's like teal
01:55:29 It's a teal blue
01:55:32 And I will be able to I'm gonna go to the wilderness. I'm gonna see what it's like
01:55:37 Trying to get a single piece of ore and I might make a video about that momentous occasion
01:55:45 Little follow-up from the the previous one
01:55:49 That's my runescape lore
01:55:51 It's it's so fun. Yes. It's so interesting. Yes, right. That's correct runescape
01:56:00 Sorry, I'm trying to think of what to say and the ask pcp message
01:56:03 We're hate ask pcp. We're almost done recording. Sorry if we miss your message this week lull, but reply here
01:56:09 And we'll read your
01:56:12 post
01:56:14 Okay, thank you post haste
01:56:17 Yeah, oh shit, I should have said that I should have said post haste, but I
01:56:26 Okay, that's great. Uh, it looks like shit my message sucks. Oh, you know what?
01:56:31 You know what does blow about this house though? Uh, the internet's actually quite bad
01:56:35 I'm actually I'm actually glad that it has not cut out there
01:56:39 I get pretty long periods where like the internet just kind of crafts out and stops working
01:56:43 So I I have to figure out
01:56:46 Is that an improvable problem or is it just like the
01:56:51 Could you could you do the thing with the internet boosters? Yeah, I might yeah the wi-fi extender I
01:56:58 Yeah, I'm gonna try and set that up and see if it uh fixes the problem
01:57:04 But yeah at the moment my internet is not very reliable. So I'm glad that it has not fucked up
01:57:10 this call at least
01:57:13 Oh, yeah, it's probably
01:57:15 Improvable, uh, we'll see
01:57:17 You know what? Let me see if we had any messages from last week that we didn't
01:57:22 Read
01:57:26 I think
01:57:28 Yeah, we oh we got another I think the we got another uh art mail from new
01:57:34 Here, uh
01:57:35 Yeah, I think this is
01:57:39 I think this is a sequel
01:57:43 No, this is the same no, this is the same one
01:57:46 Isn't it the the the nose i'm gonna look at it again anyway
01:57:50 uh
01:57:51 No, this yes. No, this is the same one new is uh doing a bit for the dojin the dojin is coming along by the way kaiju did two more
01:58:02 Pages oh, I think I posted them in the pcp server. So you saw them
01:58:06 Oh wait kaiju's them
01:58:09 Yeah, the ones that I posted that were by kaiju
01:58:13 Let me have a look
01:58:19 Oh, they are
01:58:20 Yeah, yeah, they were they were they were more similar to the other thing
01:58:23 I thought see that's why I thought kaiju would be a good replacement because they kind of have a sort of similar style
01:58:28 See you can almost not even tell them apart. Uh, that was uh, yeah
01:58:32 But uh a few weeks ago. I was saying like ah, fuck it have different art styles
01:58:37 But it is nice if they were if they're like yeah
01:58:40 The the the anime vibe is similar. Yeah. Well, I think drinking moth has done a pretty a pretty good job of matching
01:58:48 the style as well
01:58:50 New will not match at all and that's okay
01:58:54 Uh simsie that's okay by me simsie's page. Uh looks
01:58:59 Actually closer than I expected
01:59:01 He he got more
01:59:03 He got he got close to seeing the simsie one. Is it is it just a sketch right now? It's just it's just a sketch
01:59:07 I can show you if you want actually yeah DM me or put in the pcp chat. Uh, where did he post that here we go
01:59:18 It's only yeah, it's only partially
01:59:22 Can I might even copy this, uh
01:59:26 It might be too big. Oh no, it's posting there it is
01:59:31 Oh
01:59:37 I think I did see this somewhere. Maybe I didn't I don't remember posting it but uh
01:59:45 Yeah, it does it's got the the chibi ear. Yeah, chibi ear than simsie usually does. Yeah, it's very nice
01:59:52 It's pretty it's pretty good. I mean it looks it's good. It looks good. It's pretty close
01:59:57 Yeah, close enough only only half the page is done, but like it looks really it looks cute
02:00:02 But um, yeah, I mean girl. Yeah, I went I picked kaiju first because I thought he was a pretty close match in terms of style to ed
02:00:10 But uh, it don't really I mean he's he's taken too long
02:00:14 Uh, it would never get done if I just let him do the whole thing. So
02:00:17 Oh, well
02:00:19 Uh
02:00:20 Anything done is better than anything complete is better than anything not complete. You know what I'm saying
02:00:27 Yes, yeah
02:00:29 It sure is good to have complete things completed
02:00:33 I think I heard that from I think I heard that from brian leo mali, but I don't think it's an original
02:00:38 I think he was quoting someone else
02:00:40 On his tumblr his blog or something when he said the best thing you can do is make scott pilgrim
02:00:46 He said uh on the subject on the subject of like finishing things versus like being a being a progress
02:00:52 Yeah, a procrastinator or like a perfectionist who's like
02:00:55 You know, oh, I never finish anything because it's never good enough. I never finish it and he said
02:00:59 Well, anything complete is is automatically better than anything that is isn't complete. So if you don't finish something, it's worthless
02:01:06 Uh, yeah, still still hard to like really feel that sometimes though
02:01:11 Ah, yeah, like I I know it so well and it's like yes, of course
02:01:16 It's better that I do it, but I don't want it to suck. I want to do it good
02:01:22 I want to make a nice drawing sometime. Right sure sure
02:01:27 Uh, but like unironically the the half of the course is a gun smoke
02:01:31 But drawing is hard you try and you try and it still doesn't look good, but that's okay. That's okay. That's okay
02:01:38 Rittman is so smart. Yeah, he's he said I down to earth wisdom
02:01:45 He's got a humble
02:01:47 With mine humble brain
02:01:54 Okay, I think that we got a
02:01:56 Stop me if we read this question last week
02:02:00 from Rob
02:02:01 Right now I'm having issues with my parents being unsupportive of my lifestyle
02:02:05 Have you ever experienced something similar? And if so, how did you cope?
02:02:08 Were you able to get through to them eventually? I'm having a hard time with this
02:02:12 Do we do we read that one last week? I don't think we read that one. No, okay
02:02:18 Parents being unsupportive of your lifestyle
02:02:21 I guess
02:02:23 I mean the closest thing
02:02:25 I would say when I was like
02:02:28 Shortly out of college
02:02:29 My dad did not understand why I was not getting a job
02:02:34 Why I was not out you know pounding the pavement
02:02:37 Pounding the pavement looking for you know 40 hours a week regular regular employment
02:02:43 Uh, so he would be very frustrated with me over that stuff
02:02:49 And how did I cope with it? Honestly, I just kind of had to
02:02:54 Placate him as best I could because I was living under his roof. So like I couldn't
02:02:58 Just tell him to fuck off
02:03:00 uh, I just kind of had to
02:03:02 Just kind of had to grin and bear it and do what he said for a while and then eventually I moved out
02:03:08 And now I don't have to do what he says anymore
02:03:10 Um, yeah, yeah, I never really had a lot of
02:03:15 Like non-supportiveness from my parents, but I have like had like yeah, you should probably try to do this
02:03:22 We'd like it if you did that. Yeah, and I'm like, um, I'm trying
02:03:25 I think at the time
02:03:27 When I told them that I was making money off patreon
02:03:30 They stopped caring so much because they're they're they're their worries were mostly that I wasn't able to support myself
02:03:36 I'm like, I'm I'm bringing money in don't worry about it
02:03:39 So they don't really mind too much
02:03:41 Yeah, I'll
02:03:44 Well, we got a
02:03:46 We got a question about um, what do you do if your parents are unsupportive of your lifestyle? How do you cope with it?
02:03:54 Talk to them or don't we don't talk what?
02:03:58 I you you're unable to escape. I'm not sure if rob lives with his parents or not. He's not specified
02:04:06 I mean the the hi cheesy welcome back. Hi. Hello. I'm back. Yes
02:04:12 I mean, I feel like if if you're living with your parents, this is
02:04:16 the sort of situation where
02:04:19 You would need to find a way to cope because you kind of scape them
02:04:22 If you can't yeah, you're gonna have to if you really do a lot of like find ways to hide what you do
02:04:29 I mean, I would just try everything in your power to move out
02:04:33 It yeah, if um
02:04:36 Yeah, if it comes down to like a just a fundamental difference of values like they
02:04:40 Think you should be doing something else and you don't think so. Yeah
02:04:44 The some might be that the only thing to do is you got to just go on your own and do something else
02:04:50 And if it's not possible, I would say don't worry about lying to them in the meantime
02:04:55 Don't worry about lying through your teeth. Just so that they don't like ruin
02:05:00 I would say lying is you're doing I would say lying is acceptable
02:05:04 Lying until you can get out of there and then getting out of there
02:05:07 If if if it can't be resolved
02:05:11 Don't worry about being like secretive. I would say
02:05:16 I would say I don't know if it's like
02:05:18 If it's I don't know what it is like
02:05:21 What does he mean by lifestyle does he mean? I don't know because he's
02:05:25 Gay or a furry or something like that or just friends or like
02:05:29 Or does he or does he mean like not not aligned with the parents or maybe that or just
02:05:34 Or is he is he like a neat or something or he doesn't have a job or something like that
02:05:38 Or he's he wants to be one thing and they think like no, you should be going to school
02:05:41 You should get a job or something like that
02:05:43 Uh, it sort of depends
02:05:45 On what what exactly depends but largely
02:05:48 um
02:05:49 if you're at the if you're
02:05:52 unable to
02:05:54 gain independence
02:05:56 Uh, try not to like aggravate them. I suppose if they are likely to throw you out or like burn a bridge or like
02:06:04 Cause you problems you you have you have to guard your uh connection to uh
02:06:10 Support what what oh fucking my alarm's going off. I mean you you have to do
02:06:15 You have to do what you have to do in order to ensure that you will not be thrown out on the street, right?
02:06:20 Look, uh, maybe
02:06:22 I don't know. Don't don't not consider maybe killing your parents as an option to like that can be on the table as well
02:06:29 You know, I don't know. I feel like you're getting trouble for that
02:06:32 Like if you if you want to like, you know, it's all about you being comfortable. You know, they they're in the way of that. Well
02:06:40 Like they they turn the channel when you want to watch some things like it's my turn for the tv
02:06:45 You you you got to do something
02:06:48 My parents can't just watch tv at another time. You have to destroy that
02:06:51 My parents don't approve of my lifestyle. They don't understand why I watch all of quintin reviews
02:06:56 nine hour long, uh
02:06:58 disney channel sitcom retrospectives
02:07:00 They think it's cringe and I can't why can I explain?
02:07:04 That it's important to us zoom or zoom or culture
02:07:07 Um, look look mom. I know I know pan pizza just fired me from being his podcast editor. Okay. I'm in between jobs right now
02:07:14 All right, so you can't I can't let you any drug money this week
02:07:18 My parents are stoop. My parents are fucking loony lefties and they don't think I should be minting nfts
02:07:24 Uh, they uh, have an agenda
02:07:26 What's
02:07:28 Yeah, what's the nft? Who wants his nfts bought up? I'm moving the fuck out of this shithole
02:07:32 They're trying I just tell it
02:07:34 They're trying to bully me. They're trying to bully me into suicide for making nft
02:07:38 They're trying to cry bully me. They're taking away my don't they
02:07:42 My parents won't stop going on twitter and
02:07:46 Trying to cancel me
02:07:50 Making up grooming allegations. They just they they think it's funny
02:07:55 Um, oh, yeah, where the damn
02:07:58 Gosh, yeah, I get have we answered this guy's question
02:08:02 In all seriousness, if you're like gary trans you should move the fuck out of there as soon as possible if they're against that lifestyle
02:08:08 You're not gonna
02:08:09 You're not gonna live comfortably and eventually like hiding is gonna make you go fucking insane
02:08:14 If that's if that should yeah, if that's the issue then yes, I would I would think although I mean
02:08:19 Yeah, if you can't support god, you know
02:08:21 If you can't support yourself and you gotta do what you gotta do and if like being openly whatever is gonna get you
02:08:28 Homeless, you know, you might have to be sneaky
02:08:32 Uh to preserve your to preserve your access to vital resources. You got to treat it like a survival game
02:08:39 Yeah, you can't get you can't let your uh, your bars go too low. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm
02:08:45 Exactly
02:08:46 Look, that's that's the the extent of that. I think the perfect strategy would be just don't pay the irs any taxes
02:08:55 That's the advice I find like three other guys who are like zealots
02:09:01 And at celebrities like move in with them
02:09:03 And then just same save money for an RV and I think you'll be
02:09:11 Wrapping is hot right now
02:09:14 It will if you need practice you can practice by um rapping along with Lincoln Park and that
02:09:20 Your skills videos make videos where you talk about the MCU
02:09:25 You know and anything maybe maybe make a maybe make a podcast where you talk about sheatholk every week
02:09:30 Listen, you're in in life. Your parents are the ultimate big money connections. You must you must preserve them
02:09:37 You must preserve them at any cost
02:09:41 Uh, all right enough of that
02:09:44 uh
02:09:45 let's um
02:09:46 something something
02:09:48 Sai monday says
02:09:50 I know you update spotify before I know you mentioned the f cap
02:09:52 Maybe you can make a new account or try a different distributor. I use anchor fm same copy spotify
02:09:57 It's simple upload to auto distribute spotify
02:10:00 Signed one of the fans who use the spotify, uh
02:10:04 I don't want to make a different account
02:10:06 I mean, I guess we I guess we could because we just make it like a procrastinator spotify account two
02:10:12 Because the first one hit its episode limit two
02:10:15 Crescinators because there's two of us honestly. Maybe that is the thing to do. Oh what a hassle
02:10:21 The two crass
02:10:23 There's they're they're crossing. They're two
02:10:25 Yeah
02:10:26 You know what it's true. Um, okay
02:10:30 Sanky c warby seedle says how does the guest system work?
02:10:34 Is there an open invite to select people whoever shows up was in or is there something more to it? Um
02:10:41 It's it's pretty much just like if you've been a guest before yeah
02:10:45 Previous guests like a previous guests are mostly welcome to come back on if they
02:10:50 want to
02:10:51 um, I mean
02:10:52 Never paint and asha were on the other day and that was just never paint
02:10:56 Just asked me if they could come on because he wanted to talk about tulkin
02:11:00 And I said, okay
02:11:02 And I kind because I kind of knew those guys like I'd seen them around and talked to them on discord and on twitter and stuff before
02:11:07 So I I already kind of knew them
02:11:10 Basically, it's just if we know you
02:11:12 And you ask to come on we'll usually say yes, and that's and that's and that's how I got on this episode
02:11:18 Oh, yeah, you just said hey ben. I want to talk about fucking unique namesaurus is a stupid video
02:11:24 And I said that's easier for me than watching it. So yes
02:11:29 Yeah
02:11:30 We're all just shitting on it already
02:11:33 And uh and ben server. Oh, that's right. Well, like I could extend that's right also helps me like
02:11:38 flush out
02:11:40 My ideas I because I might make a video responsive is
02:11:44 um, I'm on the fence about it, but
02:11:47 Because I've been so fucking yeah, I mean it doesn't sound like a terrible idea
02:11:52 Um, yeah, I mean I was gonna name it something like I I watched this eight hour long video
02:11:57 So you don't that would be actually actually that's a good I like that. I think that's
02:12:03 a good idea
02:12:04 It's a good. It's a good title. Yeah, it has the right attitude. I'm the drama critic
02:12:09 I watched an eight hour video. I'm cheesy manfredo. I watch
02:12:14 Um, that's good
02:12:16 The next question was will it's also likely catch up to one piece or will he wait until two piece to do so?
02:12:21 I will catch up
02:12:23 I'll get around to it. I've been busy
02:12:25 As I've two pieces bikini bottom
02:12:29 What it's spongebob. Oh, yeah, they that's when they that's when the crew meets spongebob
02:12:35 And uh, honestly, I love this little guy. Honestly, why not honestly?
02:12:39 Why why not?
02:12:42 Oh, I can picture it in my head. Luffy meets spongebob. He's like, oh, I love this little guy
02:12:46 You want to be our you want to be our crew chef and then sanji starts crying like but I thought I was
02:12:51 They just have krabby pan. Yeah. Oh my god. Sanji versus spongebob like like spongebob versus neptune
02:12:57 Like it's funny though because like the spongebob is like
02:13:01 Canonically like very small compared to a human. Yeah. I mean, he's the size of a sponge
02:13:06 He's the size of a sponge
02:13:07 So it'd be like like sanji and his big chef thing and then it would be like like in a fishbowl next to him making krabby patties
02:13:16 It'd be it'd be funny or if he it's my god is also stronger than sanji and like
02:13:21 He observes the spot in the in the monster tree as
02:13:25 Sandy and and sanji have to get into like a karate kick fight with each other. They're equally mad
02:13:32 Wait and then and then
02:13:33 Spongebob punches luffy and luffy absorbs it because he's made of rubber and then luffy gomu gomu gatling guns
02:13:39 Spongebob, but spongebob just absorbs all the blows because he's a sponge. You're like, oh, we can't beat each other. We're at a stalemate
02:13:45 And he's and he's all like wait a second
02:13:47 Uh, spongebob is the key here. He's gonna be the guy who's gonna take on um
02:13:51 Who of our fallen mucumo as they as they enter the fucking celestial dragons territory?
02:13:57 This is
02:14:00 Actually, this is funny. I almost I almost wanted one piece right?
02:14:05 One sponge piece one sponge
02:14:09 I'll feel cringe one bob. Um, oh, this is gonna make me feel cringe if I don't do it
02:14:13 If this episode comes out and I didn't do this I almost want to draw it and then uh, and then and then luffy beats up plankton
02:14:21 Is all you I you're trying to take away that krabby fatty formula. SpongeBob needs that
02:14:27 Plankton
02:14:29 I think I think I think I think not me and usa would be not me and usa would fight plankton
02:14:33 And plankton would be in some sort of giant robot or something. I think plankton would be like taken in by by buggy's screw
02:14:42 I think uh, zora would fight sandy because sandy is like black coated and all like the human medium
02:14:49 And uh
02:14:51 Black people so he he zora only fights like darkest way majority of his fights
02:14:57 He fought king and he fought I forget what number he was but the guy who could turn himself into number one
02:15:02 He was number one
02:15:03 He fought king and he fought number one cock cock is is white for sure. So that's an exception, but um
02:15:10 I
02:15:15 And
02:15:18 Because um
02:15:19 And I don't know about that
02:15:21 And zora was always talking about wanting to remove usa. I remember there was a whole tick that where someone explains
02:15:27 That zora is
02:15:29 Wait, what is what is he saying about removing? Yeah, that's like
02:15:32 But you remember when usa was he always jokes about us up was um
02:15:37 Like left the crew. Yeah, um because they were gonna get rid of the going Mary in water seven, right?
02:15:43 Yeah, and zora was like the like everyone was like no soap. Don't go and zora was like
02:15:48 Like like if you're a man be a man and like like actually act on this instead of whining
02:15:54 If you're gonna leave the crew leave, you know, that's the sort of stance. He took he was he was he was he was
02:15:59 He almost he almost called him boy, but he but he uh, but he restrained himself. Yeah, and then and then usa was like, you know what?
02:16:06 You're right. I'm leaving
02:16:09 And and like even luffy was like no don't go but zora was like no this is how the pirate's life is a pirate's life for me
02:16:16 Maybe it takes a drink
02:16:17 Said it
02:16:18 I think my favorite my favorite little joke is when um, they get usa back
02:16:23 Like after he apologized and luffy like stretches out to grab him
02:16:27 And he's back on the ship zora. I love the little thought bubble that zora has where he's like damn
02:16:32 I guess I gotta stop saying it
02:16:35 Because he started saying it like after just casually around
02:16:40 But but once usa was back, he's like like he's not mad enough to say it in front of usa
02:16:46 Yeah, zora zoro's uh
02:16:48 Zoro's a big uh, he's a big free speech guy
02:16:51 He thinks uh, you know, you're thinking it. You might you might as well say it
02:16:55 Everybody thinks it is not even japanese would be on the jargon podcast
02:17:01 No
02:17:03 Um, I can see it fucking. Yeah
02:17:07 Where where was I?
02:17:09 Uh, uh, what how do we even get on this subject? Oh, will I catch up on?
02:17:13 SpongeBob, I will cut yeah one. Yeah sponge bob
02:17:16 Uh, I hope that answers george bubman's question
02:17:19 The next question is ask bcp. How was slash is the fuco you read slash our reading ben?
02:17:26 Um, I won't take too long to answer this but I'm like I'm only like 70 pages into this big ass book of it
02:17:33 And uh, mostly what I've been reading is about the development of the western justice system
02:17:39 And how uh, it used to there used to be different
02:17:43 basically there used to be
02:17:45 It
02:17:46 Like a try there didn't used to be things like criminal trials. There didn't used to be like a state
02:17:51 It used to just be a civil matter between two individuals
02:17:54 One of whom was wronged by the other and it would basically just it would basically just be a matter of rallying the community
02:18:00 Like get people on your side to say fuck that guy. He fucked me over
02:18:04 And then just people would just demand reparations from each other and enforce that by whatever force they could muster
02:18:11 And it was basically just like a slightly more civil way of conducting like war and and uh banditry
02:18:18 And and violence against each other. It was like we don't have to we don't have to kill each other
02:18:23 We don't have to engage in an armed conflict. However, you are an asshole and I hate you and I am going to kick your ass
02:18:28 So you can just let me do that or you can like pay me some money
02:18:32 And I'll leave you alone
02:18:35 And some such and such about like the church model of the inquiry
02:18:39 Is sort of the basis for what we now consider like a like criminal trial
02:18:43 a fact finding
02:18:45 Enterprise of like determining what happened and what was done in the past and by who and this was like a model that didn't used to really exist
02:18:52 Uh, so it's been it's interesting and I like it. I should read more of it
02:18:55 I've only read like
02:18:56 I have not been reading very fast because I'm only like 70 pages in that's like a page a day or something
02:19:02 Probably averages out something like that
02:19:05 Uh
02:19:06 Next question is
02:19:09 Well, we've got another, um
02:19:13 Oh god, we've got another, uh, imager album from vinnie
02:19:17 You're all posted. Yeah
02:19:21 There is benny the uh, okay
02:19:23 Is this is this guy this guy, uh with the these
02:19:29 Have we seen these before I feel like I've seen some of these this one. I don't think
02:19:34 Oh, no, no, that's no, I think these are new. I think these are new
02:19:39 I like that I'm skinny in this picture. That's the truth now. That's the truth now
02:19:44 It's funny how well like all of the musculature is is is done on that. He is like
02:19:51 Yeah, he's very
02:19:53 Vinnie is is very
02:19:55 He's very focused on that on that
02:19:58 This looks like shipping ire
02:20:00 Like like this person ships you guys together. I guess so then
02:20:04 Then saints stand slime time form and whoopity the byproduct of his body fuels the form of his stand after ben experience
02:20:10 Ketosis for the first time the spirit of his fat cells manifested his stand slime time
02:20:14 Then saints proficiency and imagination further developed his uses of his latent abilities
02:20:19 The filth slime and sludge surroundings of ben saints surroundings can be transmuted into slime
02:20:23 And he can manipulate with his stand the limitation to ben saints abilities depend on his hydration and knowledge of chemical compounds
02:20:30 The story of you trolling other kin forms is where I got the idea of your fat
02:20:33 That is now your slime being the basis of your joe gibson. Oh my god. I can't believe
02:20:38 He remembers that
02:20:40 From when I used when I used to when I used to make troll accounts to troll the other
02:20:47 Well, yeah, there was one that I had was I I was like a
02:20:50 What character that I made up was like a guy who believed in like Japanese style like nature spirits and he like identified
02:20:57 He was like a theater. He was like a I'm gonna get as fat as possible sort of guy
02:21:01 Who like believed that he was the incarnation of his own like body fat and he just wanted to like increase himself
02:21:09 That guy got banned really fast
02:21:11 That was pretty epic that guy got banned fast
02:21:13 And he was banned because the profile picture I used was like an old painting of like a fat like noblemen
02:21:20 But like that doesn't seem fair. It was literally just like a picture of a fat guy like what is objectionable
02:21:26 About that
02:21:27 stupid, um
02:21:29 They're fat phobic. They were they were fat phobic. They were fat phobic. I was just living my truth and
02:21:36 They didn't like it. Um, they didn't they didn't appreciate it
02:21:39 Gib and take stand platformer, but gib can be seen to being 100 cuter than ben saint in any given moment
02:21:46 Okay
02:21:48 Is that that's the power that's my power
02:21:51 That's just that's just real life
02:21:53 Yeah, yeah, that's how you really have. Yeah. That's that's yeah
02:21:58 This next one is I guess I'm wearing a chris chan striped shirt
02:22:02 And I have a sonichu medallion
02:22:05 I don't think it's v sonichu medallion. It's a sonichu medallion

02:30:16 P
02:30:17 I've been fan of the P. Can't read the whole thing
02:30:19 Yeah, I've
02:30:20 It's cut off. Let's hear it three two one go
02:30:24 Nate best
02:30:28 Give give it to me
02:30:42 Yeah
02:30:43 The full title was I have been a fan of the procrastinators podcast for five years. This is what happens to you
02:30:50 You know the you know the iceberg meme and how like the guy on the side as you go down it
02:30:55 He becomes more and more of like a weird looking freak. Yeah
02:30:58 It's like, yeah, this is like
02:31:00 At the bottom of the pcp iceberg that's you look that's you sound like the very very bottom of the pcp iceberg
02:31:07 Underneath it says I haven't been a fan of the pcp for five years
02:31:11 It's not it's just the the length of time you become you are a fan. Just you become like a freak
02:31:16 You end up down there
02:31:18 I get I get pictured the whole iceberg and just
02:31:22 weird phrases that like
02:31:24 Need like two hour videos to explain what they mean like
02:31:28 All the way at the bottom. It's like it would say um, it's a jeff never left the pcp
02:31:36 Icebergs jeff never left the pcp
02:31:40 There's one more. This is the only new voicemail it received it's called thoughts on Trixie and it's two seconds long
02:31:47 So let's do it. Oh boy at three three two one go
02:31:50 bullying works
02:31:53 Bullying works through it does work true worked on jk rally
02:32:00 Only centrist and cucks complain about bullying I would say
02:32:05 Yeah, I would say bullying works in the sense that in this situation
02:32:11 um having a a vocal force
02:32:15 Calling Trixie out for the bullshit she was doing did lead to more people
02:32:21 like
02:32:22 Not caring anymore about her. I don't honestly
02:32:26 I'm not sure. I'm not sure if if bullying and and and and anti stuff, you know
02:32:33 People complaining about her being mean to her. I don't think that's really did anything
02:32:37 Or I don't think it was the main the main thing is just people weren't
02:32:40 weren't watching
02:32:42 like sure but like
02:32:44 the
02:32:46 I feel like
02:32:47 certain
02:32:48 I feel like she would be doing better
02:32:50 if there had been no like
02:32:53 outrage
02:32:54 like like publicly about
02:32:56 stuff
02:32:58 I think it was a factor it would have but I don't think it was it would have gone under the radar for a bunch of people
02:33:03 And they would just be like wonder when the next video is and then they would watch it
02:33:06 But she did yeah, I guess she did change her content so much
02:33:11 The people just left anyway, so I don't know. I I think them. I think that's a
02:33:16 A relatively smaller there were there were definitely people that like got mad at her
02:33:21 Decided they didn't like her anymore because of things she did or think she said or stuff like that, but I think
02:33:27 In in the main it's just her content was different and and bad now
02:33:32 and uh
02:33:33 she was boring now and uh
02:33:35 That's that's what people just yeah, that's just too. Yeah, I guess I guess
02:33:40 Bullying works is just a generally true term for various things, but maybe not in this situation
02:33:47 I mean at the end of the day if you're making videos people want to watch they'll they'll watch them even if they hate you
02:33:54 You know
02:33:55 Or a lot of people will people will watch things
02:34:00 And that's that's the only thing that is true
02:34:03 I'm willing to watch like an eight hour long video just to confirm my hate
02:34:08 Exactly people do people do be watching people do be consuming content though
02:34:13 And I'm willing to bet only I'm handful people have actually finished the video
02:34:17 And so I'm in a secret club if you it sounds boring. It's like you beat um getting over it
02:34:24 And you're in the secret forum
02:34:27 All right that with the ending of getting over is the secret form
02:34:30 Yes, the secret form where people who have who have beaten the game can talk about
02:34:34 How will they beat the game with other people who beat the game?
02:34:38 You can hack in there, but like
02:34:40 The reward obviously means nothing if you didn't try to get there legitimately
02:34:46 I bet there were some I bet there were a bunch of smart Alex
02:34:48 Who thought they were real clever who would go on there and be like I didn't beat the game
02:34:52 I I found the link here somewhere ha ha
02:34:55 I'm sullying your space
02:34:57 knowing that it was a it's the reward of
02:35:00 Or I'm kind of basically like oh, I guess I don't want to finish reading the game now
02:35:05 I mean I mean I think that's not it's that's not what it's about though. It's not about the reward
02:35:09 No, and I think it's a cool like thing to do
02:35:12 Because people would you know, they want to beat the game to get the cool prize
02:35:17 Obviously the reward is that you feel like you've accomplished something and the
02:35:22 The forum is just sort of like a little bonus for people who want to feel like exclusive
02:35:28 What if what if like y'all what if if you beat the game y'all to know the reward is like an NFT of you beating the game
02:35:36 Like a splash mountain take a picture, but an NFT
02:35:40 Oh, yeah, like at disney. I started giving it an NFT. It's an NFT of you going on splash mountain
02:35:45 There's no picture or anything. It's just like an NFT that says you went on the ride
02:35:49 I
02:35:54 That tofu may be sick disgusting. I hated it. I hated every second of it and yet I ate all of it
02:36:01 Uh, maybe that's why I'm feeling sick now. Maybe it's not the hangover coming back. Yeah castle like me and your mom last night
02:36:11 What she made you sick she was disgusting and ate and I ate all of it and now
02:36:19 I mean
02:36:23 That's a bummer man. Um
02:36:26 Oh, no, that's the last of the voicemails. Thank god
02:36:30 No more of that. Okay. Well, there were technically two more voicemails that were just weekly reminded to play
02:36:34 Ben's weekly reminded to play delta run chapter two and ben's weekly reminded to catch up on one piece
02:36:40 I've already been. Oh, I I never finished chapter two. Oh
02:36:44 Yeah, never even started it never even opened that shit. No, I
02:36:48 Didn't I feel like chapter three is probably
02:36:51 Coming out soon. It's been long enough
02:36:53 Yeah, any day now. Oh, maybe
02:36:56 Yeah, I missed I missed the train when everyone was drawing. Um, like
02:37:01 NSFW are of queen
02:37:04 Of queen. Oh, yeah queen, right? Yeah
02:37:08 They should have given like a name like an actual name
02:37:12 Yeah
02:37:16 Oh, wait, people still draw spampton. I keep forgetting he's not either deltas. Yeah, spampton. Spampton's the new tumblr boy
02:37:23 Is it is he or is that ironic? No, no people legitimately love him. He's great. He's a very funny character, but he also can be like
02:37:32 Like uh, like a metaton-esque like uh tumblr sexy boy sexy man thing
02:37:38 I I had two mutuals who like once spampton dropped they drew nothing but spampton
02:37:45 Right, like that's all they fucking drew just spampton over and over again
02:37:50 and
02:37:51 Well, I don't
02:37:54 I don't I don't get it. Well, of course you don't you haven't played the game
02:37:58 I haven't played the game. So, you know, what would I like? Why are all these people
02:38:02 Caring about something? I don't know
02:38:05 Who's the steven universe guy? What does he even do? Like what has he ever done for me hyper fixations be damn
02:38:18 Oh, I feel terrible
02:38:25 This is my this is my my arc for this episode is I start out low and I just get lower I start out saying
02:38:31 Uh, I'm hungover. Uh, I'm tired. Uh, I'm sick. Oh, I know I'll get I'll get Chinese food. Oh, but it's only made it worse
02:38:39 I went through a whole I learned a lesson a valuable lesson don't buy Chinese food. Just don't do it
02:38:44 Just don't do it msg
02:38:47 um
02:38:49 Got something good. Do you think you caught a little a little something?
02:38:54 coronavirus
02:38:55 baby
02:38:57 No, although, uh, some people I know were exposed to it recently
02:39:02 So there's I have to I was I was like third hand exposed to covid
02:39:08 So I have to test myself in a couple days
02:39:10 But I think I think I'm probably in a clear because none of those people actually like got sick. So I probably won't either
02:39:16 I um, I got covid back like at the start of august and it really fucking like set back everything I was working on
02:39:25 Yeah, if anyone sees me on twitter, it says like working on five comics and I just say that
02:39:32 A lot of stuff was supposed to come out a lot earlier, but um
02:39:36 It's fucking yeah, I couldn't do anything and coincidentally on the same day that um
02:39:41 I got covid my computer crashed so hard. I needed to reinstall windows
02:39:47 And when I reinstalled it, um, it deleted a bunch of my old files
02:39:51 Including close including the episode of main character syndrome. I recorded that same day
02:39:59 No
02:40:00 Which was uh, yolo swag studios without berries and cream
02:40:04 And really that's a week. Oh, yeah, that sucks so much
02:40:09 Yeah, exactly. So I have to like get back on being ahead of myself with fucking main character syndrome
02:40:16 um
02:40:18 and I was supposed to
02:40:20 Um, there was a kickstart campaign. I was supposed to start but now um, it's gonna start later this month actually
02:40:27 You guys have you guys seen my post about that?
02:40:29 Uh, no, I don't think so. Was it uh, is it an s of w?

02:40:55 Yes, um
02:40:57 I don't I don't want
02:40:59 Should I mention the artist should I how much crop and what's the harm?
02:41:04 Yeah, whatever. Um, because I I kind of wanted to keep it a secret till the day of but um, I mean how much crossover does the pcp?
02:41:12 Am I an s of w account have anyway?
02:41:14 Probably not too much
02:41:18 Yeah, not too much, but um, yeah the the people involved is just it's me and two other guys
02:41:24 And um, it's uh, it's galacta b and superspo
02:41:29 You guys know those guys I had seen I had seen them around I'd seen their
02:41:34 Before I recognize both of them. I I do not
02:41:38 I have not heard of those
02:41:40 Um superspo is a buddy of mine and van actually has mentioned his like stuff on um
02:41:48 On the pcp before
02:41:51 And um, he mostly does like very like
02:41:54 like uh
02:41:55 Like obese women commissions
02:41:58 Um score
02:42:01 Yeah, exactly. Um
02:42:04 Kind of look for
02:42:05 Ellie is already I'm gonna put none of this on because some of it is very suggestive, but um
02:42:10 We already showed that picture of gib
02:42:14 On top of me as harco
02:42:17 Yeah, exactly
02:42:19 Man sure sure was problematic for that adult harco to fucking hit on and
02:42:25 Have fucking sex with
02:42:27 Child not so that was that was pretty fucked up. I went in Rome
02:42:32 I don't know what that means
02:42:34 Went in Rome
02:42:37 Went in japan do as the japanese do
02:42:40 Yeah, I'm trying to look for like art by galacta b but they got so it was so fucked up
02:42:46 That's hardcore sex scene between harco and and now to with concy watching
02:42:52 I found it didn't like it. So it just felt a little off to me. Um
02:42:57 This is a good art by superspo
02:43:00 Yeah, superspo doesn't comic galacta b um
02:43:05 And i'm i mean i'll tell you i'll give you a little i'll give you a little secret insight about the comic
02:43:10 Um, all the comics are finished
02:43:12 I currently ordered test copies and those are going to be coming soon. Once I get that
02:43:17 I am I am max reviving post of the clown. He's coming back. Oh my god
02:43:24 Wait as a cartoon
02:43:27 No, it's it. I'm going I'm I'm I'm gonna count. I'm going back to my clownification. I'm re-clowning myself
02:43:33 Oh, very good. I didn't realize you had unclowned
02:43:37 Well, I know you changed your twitter your twitter profile or your your pfp
02:43:44 Um, the positive that all the positive clown accounts have been dormant although recently i've been like posting to kind of like
02:43:51 You know like, you know rally up some interests. I know you've been doing uh, you've been doing my alien girlfriend
02:43:57 Yes, and
02:43:59 Yeah, so you haven't really you haven't been clown posting
02:44:02 I've been clown posting in a while
02:44:04 um, I
02:44:05 I've been on uh, I also like um after
02:44:09 I I mean if anyone reads my alien girlfriend, you might have noticed that um
02:44:14 It's mostly just been guest artists right now because my computer even though I reinstalled windows
02:44:19 There was like a bigger issue my computer had
02:44:22 And um, my my usual tech guy my usual buddy who comes my buddy who actually built that computer for me after that um
02:44:30 Go fund me. I I ran. Um
02:44:33 Has been ghosting me like he just won't talk to me at all like I've been DMing him on everything
02:44:39 I've been DMing him for weeks and he's just not I don't know what I did. Maybe I fucking offended him
02:44:43 or something
02:44:45 Yeah, so I so I had to go to I actually had to go to a professional
02:44:49 The funny thing is that I even DM him told him that I could pay him
02:44:52 to like
02:44:53 Take a look at the computer and like, you know fix it, but um, he just was not interested so I went to um
02:45:00 actual tech guys
02:45:01 And that happened like two weeks ago. So now my computer is up and running again
02:45:07 Um
02:45:08 I'm gonna go back to fucking drawing my alien girlfriend and we're not gonna have guest artists for a good while now actually
02:45:16 Speaking of oh, yeah, no go on. Yeah. No, we're gonna say I was gonna say speaking of
02:45:22 Things that happened that delay kick starters
02:45:25 That just reminds me about how yet
02:45:28 I have not checked
02:45:29 Did I mention that the the chinese company lady
02:45:32 Ghosted me about like printing my book like we freaking had worked
02:45:36 Out a whole bunch of stuff about how to print the book and then like when i'm finally ready to like order it
02:45:41 She just like stops responding. I think you mentioned that but I would have assumed she got back to you by now
02:45:47 You know what I have not checked in a few days. Maybe she did in the last week and I just haven't seen it
02:45:51 But she didn't like three weeks
02:45:54 Worst case scenario worst case scenario should fucking die
02:45:58 I
02:45:59 Yeah, I gotta check may it's possible. Maybe she'll have gotten back. Isn't that would be a really big relief
02:46:05 I don't know if this is still happening, but isn't it like in china? They're on full lockdown or something
02:46:10 Like they're not even allowed to leave their apartments
02:46:12 Um
02:46:13 I and what are they think about that that that was like, uh, that was like a couple months ago. I remember
02:46:20 Like they just weren't allowed and they were they would get arrested if they
02:46:25 I mean, yeah, I know they had really strict like lockdown stuff over there
02:46:29 I mean, I don't think it was the whole country and like I mean, how long
02:46:33 Could they keep that up?
02:46:36 How long can they keep the lie up?
02:46:38 Yeah, the the covid lie. Yeah, how long could we lie?
02:46:42 Yeah
02:46:43 Oh, I was gonna ask you Ben. Um, do you know, do you know what's the percentage number that like Kickstarter takes from
02:46:50 Your campaign? I think it's something like 10 10 percent or nine percent or something like that
02:46:56 I would have to look it up. That's what I figured. It's it's around there. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, yeah, I gotta
02:47:02 I gotta crunch the numbers. I mean, I crunched the majority of them already like
02:47:07 Before the Kickstarter, I have like a rough estimate about like how much the Kickstarter should be
02:47:13 What what what are your estimates?
02:47:16 Um, it's probably gonna be a little over
02:47:22 10,000
02:47:24 For the Kickstarter. Yeah. Yeah, because each because each artist, um
02:47:28 The the the whole idea of the real goal of the Kickstarter was to get three months in my rent paid
02:47:36 Right, right. That's the real goal, right and each artist is going to get like three thousand
02:47:42 And um the comics are each one of our comics is between 15 to 20 pages
02:47:49 Um, and I and I kind of picked three thousand at random because one of one of my buddies suggested it because they talked about like
02:47:56 Oh, yeah, this should cover grant for like
02:47:59 Uh, a handful of months and I'm like, oh, yeah, I could just
02:48:03 Since I since I could just treat it as like the the anthology is like the employee the employer and
02:48:11 I I run it. So I just get to the side. I'm gonna get fucking paid, right?
02:48:17 I guess so
02:48:18 I mean
02:48:19 That's one way to think about it. Yeah, and so everyone's getting
02:48:23 3000
02:48:24 And we're gonna try to print a hundred books
02:48:27 A hundred books for a ten thousand dollars
02:48:31 Yeah, see it seems wait, how big are these books?
02:48:35 Uh, the books are like 60 pages
02:48:39 How much is one gonna cost how much is one gonna cost? Yeah, I was thinking like maybe around 25 to 35
02:48:47 Okay
02:48:48 Yeah, how does that add up to $10,000?
02:48:50 Oh, no the print. No the printing company
02:48:53 Okay, wait the print company for for a hundred books is gonna charge like around 700
02:48:59 Okay, I'm just saying. All right, but if your goal is to sell a hundred books and
02:49:05 Is you're selling them for 25 dollars a piece? That's 2,500 dollars. That's not 10,000 dollars
02:49:11 Okay, so
02:49:14 Okay, so
02:49:17 Okay, so
02:49:19 Let's see how the word this did not sound like I'm an idiot. I guess
02:49:23 Okay, so it's it's it's like
02:49:26 For just to pay the artist, right?
02:49:29 And like 700 to print out like 100 books and the the thing is that like there's there's no guarantee
02:49:36 Like we're gonna have like a tee like it's gonna we're gonna print out a hundred of them
02:49:40 But the idea is that like
02:49:42 You reserve a copy
02:49:44 From a certain tier that you pay for right?
02:49:47 Yeah
02:49:49 So
02:49:51 Yeah, and like so what's like how does that add up? How does that make 10,000?
02:49:56 Well, we also have shipping
02:49:58 For shipping is gonna be to ship out like a hundred books. It's gonna be like over 500
02:50:04 And then we got a lot of envelopes
02:50:06 Doug give am I am I failing to communicate something?
02:50:10 They mentioned the artist was nine grand
02:50:14 Okay, which is the bulk of it. I
02:50:16 I'm not I'm not I'm not saying I'm not saying you should not
02:50:20 No, I'm not saying like you should not
02:50:23 Uh
02:50:24 Get that much what I'm saying is if you sell a hundred books at 25
02:50:30 Dollars a piece that doesn't that doesn't make 10,000. We're not we're not we're not selling the hundred books
02:50:35 We're printing a hundred books
02:50:37 So you're selling less than a hundred books
02:50:39 So it's even what how does that make that doesn't get you 10,000 dollars?
02:50:45 All right, am I am I losing my mind? Well, I think ben you're you're thinking like uh
02:50:51 People on the Kickstarter will pay just for the book
02:50:55 I feel like there's probably tiers of like higher cost. There's there's tiers. Yes. We're like certain tiers reserve you a copy of those 100
02:51:04 Right
02:51:05 Ryan
02:51:06 Yeah
02:51:07 So we're gonna we're printing out a hundred, but there's no guarantee that all 100
02:51:13 They're not gonna they're not all gonna be sold sold during the Kickstarter
02:51:16 The idea that is like I'm gonna have like a supply of these books to sell for out
02:51:21 I
02:51:24 I feel so when you use when you go to the Kickstarter and you say I would like I would like to support this
02:51:30 I would like a book
02:51:31 There's no guarantee you will get a book. There's people who would
02:51:34 There's people who will support it
02:51:37 And they're not gonna like I mean I there's gonna be like a I think the lowest you can get is like a digital copy
02:51:43 Right for one of the tiers, right?
02:51:45 Okay
02:51:46 Yeah, and then like and there's gonna be another tier that reserves you a physical copy
02:51:51 So, okay, so you're expecting
02:51:53 Okay, so you're expecting there's gonna be people who are gonna support and they're not gonna get a book out of it
02:51:58 Okay, yeah, I
02:52:00 I get okay. I guess I get it
02:52:03 Do you think do you think that most people will support it but not buy a book?
02:52:08 Um, well, that's where I like I'm like kind of like if you about it
02:52:12 I think the majority people would want a book like they're gonna reserve for I mean, yeah
02:52:16 I would think I would think that like the standard backer it like would pledge
02:52:21 To get the book
02:52:23 Yeah
02:52:25 Right, but I don't but I think charging like what like, um
02:52:30 25,000
02:52:32 That's like that's a trick every two thousand. No, it'd be 2,500. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it'd be 2,500
02:52:38 If if a hundred if a hundred people buy a book for 25 dollars, that's 2,500
02:52:43 Right, but there's no guarantee that we're gonna get a hundred
02:52:46 Yes, and what I'm saying is that that means that
02:52:51 We're not is that the figure that that gets you to is not ten thousand dollar
02:52:55 What I'm that's what I'm saying give you understand what I'm you're saying that if you sell them at 25
02:53:01 And that's the tier that gets you the book
02:53:03 I'm saying I'm saying the number the numbers it sounds the numbers it sounds like you were expecting to do
02:53:08 The numbers it sounds like you're expecting to do do not yield the the result that you are suggesting
02:53:16 I don't know. Okay. Uh, well, there's like I mean, there's still other things that are like
02:53:21 I'm included into it like, you know, like not just shipping but at the order a bunch of envelopes
02:53:27 And also like you know, that's not you fool you fool. I'm not that's not what I'm saying
02:53:32 I'm not saying I'm not saying no your expenses. Don't justify it. I'm saying
02:53:38 How do you plan to make that money? I'm saying that a hundred people buying the book doesn't
02:53:43 Make doesn't make the money that you're saying it makes
02:53:47 So I gotta charge them off with the book
02:53:49 No, I mean, I would say you would either have to
02:53:53 Got what what do I think? Well, here here's what I think
02:53:56 I mean, depending on how like if you if you don't expect to sell that many if you're any expecting to like
02:54:01 Hypothetically sell a hundred on it if you're lucky
02:54:04 um
02:54:06 And you need ten grand for that
02:54:09 Uh, that's gonna be difficult unless all of the people are willing to pledge large amounts of money for each book
02:54:17 Yeah
02:54:18 It would if you're if you're if it's possible to sell
02:54:22 Um, there is gonna be there is gonna be a tier higher. There is gonna be a tier higher than like
02:54:28 The physical book
02:54:30 Yeah, sure, right there's gonna be like more tiers
02:54:33 It's gonna be a little bit more like incentivization
02:54:36 I think if because like the the printing of the books is relatively small of a cost compared to paying the artists
02:54:43 I feel like it wouldn't be
02:54:45 Like too bad to try and print 200 books
02:54:48 Or like more. Yeah
02:54:50 Yeah, so that there are more books to go around so that more people
02:54:54 can pledge
02:54:56 For a book and potentially a higher tier of the book
02:55:00 All right, you know what now that's starting to make a lot more sense
02:55:05 Okay, now that makes a lot more sense about like the the more volume you have the more of the higher tiers you can get
02:55:13 Therefore, you'll be easier to get at all. No, I get you because like I um
02:55:19 I did watch other people talk about this and they say like yeah
02:55:22 I usually order like 200 or 300 and I never I never knew why people would order that much
02:55:27 I just feel like wouldn't like 100 just be enough
02:55:29 But like now I see what you mean. Well, I mean you should like because I would
02:55:34 Yeah, the whole I think that you wouldn't that you wouldn't decide how many copies you were going to print until after the Kickstarter
02:55:39 It was done and you like knew how many orders you needed to fulfill, right?
02:55:47 I mean, yeah, and then that that would like
02:55:50 Make the
02:55:51 I mean that would make the the cost of the Kickstarter like lower, right?
02:55:56 Um
02:55:57 Slightly, I mean if you're paying the artist's nine thousand and that is how much it costs then
02:56:04 That is a fixed fee that they're gonna need that money for the art that you're doing but the number of books
02:56:10 Uh needed to print
02:56:13 It's like the larger like it's it's not as expensive to get a larger amount of books
02:56:17 And it is to pay more artists, you know
02:56:20 The the tier the tier for the for the book for the physical book would have to go up a little bit
02:56:25 We'll have to go up to match like the shipping and the and the envelope and like the labor cost of packaging the stuff, right?
02:56:33 I mean, doesn't it all does it not already include that?
02:56:36 Um, no, it's yeah, it is included. It's just that it's it's it's all all that is included. I just don't have it at um 100 books
02:56:46 Why 100 books?
02:56:48 Okay, because the the idea was
02:56:50 That like a lot I I sell a lot of the stuff. I I do like vending that convention. So I would sell it
02:56:56 Yeah, or like if people will set up some sort of shop where people could like order it later on like let's say that like
02:57:03 During the Kickstarter people don't have like the money to like buy a copy
02:57:07 But like I don't have a lot to like sell for the course of the year
02:57:11 Right and of course like of course all the artists are gonna get a percentage of the sales, right?
02:57:15 Yeah
02:57:19 So why so why a hundred?
02:57:22 I mean, it just seemed like a reasonable number
02:57:24 Okay, uh, so the the goal is to have overstock so that you'll have
02:57:29 Stock left over that you can sell. I mean because if you have overstock
02:57:33 You could you could sell the book for like cheaper because you're gonna sell it in person, right?
02:57:36 That's that's why more people to buy it. Yeah
02:57:39 So is a hundred a hundred is like the minimum you want to print
02:57:42 I'm just thinking like what if you so what if you sell 200 books?
02:57:45 What if the Kickstarter is a big success and 200 people that buy the book then you would print 200, right?
02:57:49 I'm gonna have to grab a quote right now or you would print more
02:57:53 Yeah, um
02:57:55 Yeah, if if it's like a huge ass success, we're gonna like, you know, like if people like, um
02:58:02 If people pay for the tier where they get the physical book, they're gonna like they're gonna get a they're gonna get a book
02:58:07 We're just gonna like raise the number of orders, right?
02:58:09 Yeah, well, I'm saying if you sell a lot of books if it's this big success then you can buy
02:58:17 a bigger print run
02:58:19 And that will yield that will lead to the cost per copy going down
02:58:23 Uh, if you if you buy more at a time, right, right?
02:58:28 Uh, so what what point what point was I trying to make there?
02:58:32 I think I was I was a bit confused because I thought you you said there's going to be a hundred and
02:58:37 That will pay for the 10 grand 10 grand
02:58:42 like goal
02:58:44 When it's more likely that you would need more than a hundred people buying the book
02:58:50 to get that high
02:58:51 Yeah, unless the almost the special tier is like, uh, pay 500 dollars and you get the super special golden book
02:58:59 Unless yeah, unless you expect like that like a majority of the money would be going to yeah
02:59:05 Some other tier that either like doesn't include a book or
02:59:08 Includes like a lot is something else. It's a much higher tier that includes a book
02:59:12 But also a bunch of other stuff like if you think that's where most of the money is going to come from
02:59:17 Yeah, this is gonna this is going to be a big dummy thing to say, but I didn't realize that
02:59:20 Oh, yeah, the majority of people would want a physical copy, right?
02:59:24 Yeah
02:59:26 That's what I'm driving at
02:59:29 Well, that's well, no, no, no, you're right. I mean, this is why it helps that I say this out of the open
02:59:34 I just don't want no one in the comment section to to bully me
02:59:38 Okay, well, sorry, but it's too late. It's too late
02:59:44 Okay, um
02:59:46 Yeah, uh, no, yeah, I should I should you're right. I should be like order enough that like it
02:59:51 It would cover for the fucking kickstart. Yeah, I would I would right now
02:59:54 The way that I the way that I did mine is I
02:59:58 Yeah, like I thought I planned like, okay
03:00:00 What's the minimum number of copies that I would want to make and then I'm like, okay
03:00:03 I'll set the price at that level
03:00:06 And then if it sells more than that then I can print then I print more and that actually like reduces
03:00:11 Costs actually it actually makes each copy sold more
03:00:15 Profitable because the the cost per copy goes down if you print a bigger run
03:00:19 I can't remember how I figured out my load of ghosts one
03:00:23 I think
03:00:24 All of the different things like the plush and the pins and everything made it more complicated
03:00:29 Like if you like if your goal is to make ten thousand dollars, then I guess you would say like, okay
03:00:33 Well, each book is gonna chart cost 25. So I hope need to sell. What would be 500?
03:00:39 What would be 500?
03:00:40 copies and that would be like
03:00:43 I mean you would probably make
03:00:45 Yeah, there will there will be people that pledge
03:00:47 Hire without buying the book and there will be people that pledge at higher tiers
03:00:50 So it may end up to be sort of in the middle like 350 books you need to print
03:00:56 Yeah
03:00:58 In order to cover all the expenses
03:01:00 Pay all the artists get all the money for us sending things out the envelopes and stuff
03:01:06 Because relatively purchasing lots of books and envelopes is a lot less expensive than paying for art
03:01:13 To be made
03:01:15 Yeah
03:01:16 Hey, what happened? Hey, what happened to that a comic that I executive produced?
03:01:22 Oh, maybe you're still working on it. Still working on it. Okay. Yeah
03:01:26 I mean she she started a new job and it's like 36 hours out of the week. Oh cringe
03:01:32 Yeah, cringe. It is
03:01:34 It is cringe. I mean
03:01:36 Like like I like we'll we'll figure something out. I have um
03:01:41 What does she need a job for when I'm generous generously funding her her her her project when I'm when I'm executive
03:01:48 When I'm her producer, right? I can get her an RV. I can get her a gig
03:01:52 I can get her a rap gig in Elko, Nevada. Like what I can do. I can give you everything
03:01:56 We had everything it all ran like clockwork, but you had to fuck it up
03:02:00 Yeah, little do we know she has her own little ben saint destroying her career
03:02:07 Um, I'm a producer. I'm a big money connection
03:02:12 Oh
03:02:13 Well, I gotta do some I gotta do some like this is why this is why I like talking to you guys because um
03:02:20 Get the brain going
03:02:22 Yeah, yeah, it's good. It's good to be creative talking with creatives creatively about stuff
03:02:28 So that we can get the get the knowledge making content
03:02:32 content on the internet
03:02:35 Guys
03:02:36 Content guys let's reach a change the podcast name to content guys
03:02:40 That's awful
03:02:42 Do I know?
03:02:44 Yeah, what do you um, did you um?
03:02:47 Have you have you seen our yellow swags new podcast?
03:02:50 With a beetle moses. Yeah, we'll be the Moses. They had a boshan and turkey tom
03:02:57 I saw they had um
03:02:59 No, no, it's the one after the other. I saw they had young krip on I saw that
03:03:04 That was like the recent episode. I saw a clip of that
03:03:08 Uh, I haven't I mean I haven't actually watched the podcast or anything
03:03:12 But I am aware of it. I didn't know how long it had been going on
03:03:17 Good for them
03:03:18 I imagine having like like inviting notable people onto your show
03:03:23 Imagine how scary that would be imagine if they they have an audience
03:03:27 um
03:03:28 Can't believe anyone would do that
03:03:30 I is a scary is this a
03:03:34 Is a bit
03:03:35 it's like the
03:03:37 Hmm
03:03:38 How much would you pay for 60 pages of porno?
03:03:41 and comments for
03:03:43 Clown related to them related
03:03:46 porno, I mean
03:03:48 If it's like an indie thing that's like that i'm kick starting that that means I would pay more for it than if I would for like
03:03:54 Something that I saw in a store. I mean the artists here look very good. I think 25 dollars
03:03:59 25 to 30. Yeah
03:04:02 Okay, I uh, yeah, I'm hoping I'm hoping that
03:04:07 Slime and punishment will only cost
03:04:09 Something around like 25 or 30 dollars
03:04:13 uh
03:04:14 To that's going to depend on it literally depends on whether this stupid lady gets back to me because her printing was the cheapest
03:04:21 And that was going to make the book cost what I wanted it to cost if I go with someone else that might have to cost more
03:04:26 And I and I really don't want that
03:04:28 um
03:04:30 I get that
03:04:33 I gotta keep gotta keep those costs low. You gotta pass that savings on to the consumer, baby
03:04:38 God, I'm so done. I never want to make a physical comic
03:04:43 Ever again. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait to uh, I mean, I'm I'm planning to do like
03:04:49 kick one kick start kick start after another
03:04:52 right now
03:04:53 As as an effort to like keep paying my fucking rent
03:04:57 I will be very excited if the if the
03:05:00 Slime and punishment sees I'll be really hype
03:05:02 I'll be really hyped to get a bunch of books and put them in get a bunch of boxes and put them in boxes and do it hundreds
03:05:07 Hundreds and hundreds of boxes again kind of like the if it's anything like the vapors
03:05:12 It'll be like that, but it'll be much harder
03:05:15 Because I'll have to fold boxes, but I'll do it because uh, I love my fans so much
03:05:22 You kiss each envelope over them. Mm-hmm
03:05:25 But I'll put a little yes
03:05:26 I'll put a little smiley face just like just like spongebob
03:05:29 Making that making that crabby patty in the in the cookoff against Neptune
03:05:33 When he put the little smiley faces on the on the pickles and he and he covered them a cheese blank and gave him a little kiss
03:05:38 That's me putting together
03:05:40 My Kickstarter reward boxes, uh, when you buy things from me
03:05:44 Such a sweetheart
03:05:46 Such a sweet little guy. Come here. That's me breaks breaks your neck
03:05:52 Oh snap snap
03:05:54 Just just think about bunnies. Just think about the bunnies Lenny. Just these little sweetheart
03:05:58 Um, did you did you guys ever see like the previous porn comics that I made?
03:06:04 Uh, yeah, I think
03:06:06 I think I saw one of them. I saw some like these. Yeah. Yeah that I uh, yeah
03:06:12 Oh, I didn't see the whole thing ones are gonna look like this
03:06:15 They're gonna they're gonna they're gonna look like this. These are like eight by eleven, which is a very like weird
03:06:21 It's kind of when it the the site that I'm using doesn't have that as in like default option
03:06:27 You have to like custom it and I just kind of chose that because like I'm already drawing it by a by 11
03:06:33 because like
03:06:34 So are like the villain verse copies
03:06:37 Yeah, I was going through my bookshelves during the move and I I found my villain verse books and I
03:06:44 Carefully tucked them away friggin uh
03:06:47 Well, the lord yeah, not only did the lord of ghosts
03:06:50 Uh sheet cover lose one of his button eyes
03:06:53 Uh, I drop I dropped the uh lord of ghosts book and it creased the cover for a minute
03:06:58 I managed to I managed to uncrease it and it looks fine, but like oh no the structural integrity
03:07:05 It could easily it could happen again. It could happen again, and then it might not be uncreasible
03:07:10 no
03:07:12 Oh the structural integrity
03:07:13 Oh gotta protect that gotta protect that book structural integrity. There's only one. It's my it's the autograph
03:07:19 That's got the little phantom horn virginia inside of it. That's one of a kind
03:07:25 Collector's head
03:07:30 Oh
03:07:33 I'm sick one of the tier options I had in mind was um, uh, uh, thank you page at the end you put your fucking name
03:07:41 Yeah, that's oh, yeah, stuff's easy. Yeah, I would put like anyone that pledges like five bucks or something
03:07:47 I would put put them on a thank you page. I was gonna charge him more for that
03:07:51 Really? Yeah
03:07:53 Uh, I mean you could yeah, I mean sure I mean what I what I did is that
03:07:58 The the the size of your donation to the Kickstarter increases the font size in the back
03:08:05 Of of don't so I did that's what I did
03:08:08 So wait how much pledged at all get a little mention
03:08:12 And then people who pledge big have huge letters and they're so cool
03:08:16 Well, cheesy you have um in in one of those villain verses i'm
03:08:21 You put you drew me right you drew my little guy because I bought something
03:08:25 How much I don't remember how much it cost me it was um, I think it was I think it was
03:08:29 How much you pay me on patreon although like I kind of I kind of changed that now so like
03:08:34 Every because I I only have like nine spots and every time like
03:08:38 It's it becomes more than like nine people who are paying me that amount
03:08:42 I like I like raised up the amount you need to pay me to keep you on that page
03:08:47 Yeah
03:08:48 I would say like yeah something like that for someone that pledges like a hundred bucks or whatever
03:08:54 And then and then maybe a page of thank yous with everyone in a little little name
03:08:58 Just one all on one hundred so hopefully hundreds of names all on one page and small font for like everyone who pledges like five bucks
03:09:04 I I need no no reward tier. I I need like the I need like the joke the joke tier one, which is um
03:09:11 The like one that's like ten thousand dollars
03:09:14 If you give me if you give me um
03:09:17 four thousand
03:09:19 Um, I just put your name entirely in one page
03:09:24 Just just the whole the whole thank you just has your just your name. That's it. No one else's fucking name is on it
03:09:29 I have I have a question. I have a question. Um, so these clowns
03:09:33 These clowns they're in they're fucking right they're fucking
03:09:36 Yes, there's a lot of fucking fucking dudes. Are they fucking dudes?
03:09:40 They are fucking dudes
03:09:43 Are is it a specific dude or are there any of them like fucking a generic all those stories are are different
03:09:48 I'll tell you that much. I'm I was just thinking if there's one with like a generic like guy with no face
03:09:53 Which is sort of a thing in porn
03:09:55 You could once here is like if you pledge a thousand dollars like I'll put your face on the generic
03:10:00 I'll do all your face on your copy. Yeah
03:10:03 Uh, maybe for the next one. I'll do something like that. That's a pretty funny. Well, the thing is that I do that in my story
03:10:10 Yeah, my my story my comic is pov style
03:10:14 So so you so you're like fucking bongo in my story. You're like
03:10:18 I like it should have a little you should have a page where it's like
03:10:22 Like an outline on the page saying place penis here for maximum immersion
03:10:27 It's like it's like the page is like a little dotted line outline. Yeah place penis on page
03:10:33 You know the captain underpants like flip orama thing
03:10:36 Yes
03:10:40 If you want to see this character fuck
03:10:43 Yeah, I mean for the next one. Oh my god, this makes sense. Honestly makes make sense for yes that contact
03:10:50 Obsessed I'll call it fap orama. Fap orama
03:10:54 You've you've you flip the pages and you can do it like at your own pace. You can get faster and faster
03:11:01 If this if this blows out, um
03:11:04 Yes, or maybe I should um
03:11:08 Maybe instead of setting it to a number it's just like how many orders I get ultimately
03:11:14 And um, okay, you know what I think I could um, okay, I think I can map this out. You guys has helped you guys have helped me
03:11:21 I appreciate it
03:11:24 no
03:11:25 I'm just
03:11:26 I'm trying to
03:11:28 Just looking out looking out for you. Listen use use my
03:11:32 Experience I'm looking out for the little I'm old and I know and I have wisdom use my ancient wisdom
03:11:39 Fame famous kicks kick started king ben sain. That's right. That's correct
03:11:45 Uh, I
03:11:48 I'm telling
03:11:50 All right, I need to I need to go to the bathroom really quick. I'll be back in a minute. Sorry
03:11:55 Ben has never seen again
03:11:57 Ben died he shit himself to death just like Elvis. He shit and he puked
03:12:03 And it all of the liquids left his body at the same time and he turned to dust and he flew away
03:12:09 Uh, again could I ask you a question?
03:12:12 Yes
03:12:13 If you had the power
03:12:15 to turn
03:12:17 One random woman in the world into like
03:12:21 A giant like amoeba slime
03:12:24 That just doesn't think or anything. He just turned into slime instantly
03:12:28 Which woman would you pick?
03:12:30 So like I choose a woman and she turns into a non-thinking giant slime woman
03:12:37 She turned into an amoeba basically like a human size amoeba, but it's like a slime. It's like slime. It's like
03:12:44 You basically turn into a blob and she doesn't she doesn't like think it's like a non-thinking
03:12:50 I mean why would I want to do that 21? That sounds horrible
03:12:57 Okay, but if you had to choose I was like if you if I had to if I had to turn one
03:13:02 Um, Liz trust the the hopeful conservative leader of the the fucking tory party
03:13:10 I turned her into a blob. I would pick Nancy Pelosi. I think as
03:13:14 To turn her to turn into a slime like in the middle versus a speech
03:13:19 I think that'd be the perfect time like because people will see and people will freak the fuck out
03:13:24 See that's the reason it'd be so fucking cool. Oh
03:13:28 Well, because it'll be like you'll be good fucking riddance, you know
03:13:31 It's like the death noble with slime instead of instead of death you turn into
03:13:35 slime
03:13:38 The slime now
03:13:43 I'm just imagining that the the the the death note like anime where he's writing furiously in the pen
03:13:49 And instead of watching all of the prisoners get heart attacks. They just turn into slime and explode splatter everywhere
03:13:56 It's just so goofy
03:13:59 What's that? I want I wish I knew what the japanese word for slime was
03:14:03 And they just start calling instead of kira. They start calling him that
03:14:06 Gooper
03:14:07 Gooper the gooper strikes. This is el's most deadliest
03:14:12 Case yet. Who is goopie with an a g o o p a
03:14:18 I used to I used to know a girl back in middle school named kira
03:14:22 um
03:14:23 She was like asian and um, did she have a death note? No
03:14:28 Dang
03:14:31 Crippling depression
03:14:34 Jk, that's not true. I don't know
03:14:38 I don't know about that
03:14:40 um
03:14:41 I think I might I think for the Kickstarter might stick it for like just depending how many people like pledge that's how many I'll order
03:14:48 Yeah, like just have it open as like a tear because
03:14:53 um presuming that
03:14:55 This is what I did for a lot of ghosts. I would
03:14:58 figure out like
03:15:00 Roughly how much a single book would cost to create
03:15:05 It's usually gonna be less than 25
03:15:07 bucks if you're making a hundred of them
03:15:10 um, but just check so that
03:15:12 You have the tear that gets the book
03:15:15 the lowest tear
03:15:16 And just make sure that one pledge to that tear will cover the cost
03:15:21 And and mailing of that book so that doesn't matter how many
03:15:25 pledges you get you can still cover all the costs at the end
03:15:30 That makes sense
03:15:33 I think um
03:15:36 Yeah, I'm gonna have to really zone in and like pick a number here
03:15:40 Number munchin was really stressful for me
03:15:44 But it wasn't very important because if I didn't number munch, I wouldn't know how high to put the goal or where the stretch goal should go
03:15:52 I don't think it would have worked if I didn't think about it a lot
03:15:56 No, I got you. I need to I I kind of have
03:16:00 I'm gonna all I have is like two weeks
03:16:04 to like uh figure this out
03:16:07 And I don't want like I don't want anyone to get screwed. I already promised everyone like 3000 and I think 3000 is um
03:16:14 A decent amount. I think I think some artists get paid more than 3000 like
03:16:19 At at a professional industry level
03:16:22 Oh, yeah, I mean
03:16:24 yeah
03:16:25 mass producing comics is so
03:16:29 It's so like difficult
03:16:31 Uh, which is why it's not done on an indie scale quite so much
03:16:35 I'm I mean my my dream is that um
03:16:39 If this gets like popular enough that I get approached by some like publisher
03:16:46 and um
03:16:47 They could handle like
03:16:50 Um printing out future volumes and then yeah, the next Kickstarter would be like half as cheap
03:16:58 Yeah, that's that's what I'm hoping for
03:17:01 Not that not that I I I might try another Kickstarter for like the Clarissa gunsmoak when I finish that
03:17:08 And be like hey, it's a cowgirl. I'm gonna make a this is my other comic
03:17:13 and maybe
03:17:15 I feel like if I have that I don't need to do a Kickstarter to
03:17:20 Try and get it published. I could go to publishers and say look at my work
03:17:23 They'll probably say nah who cares, but if I do have a Kickstarter, I guess
03:17:27 I can say well, I got this many sales. So
03:17:32 What are you gonna do about that? It's uh, it's really tough right now to like get anything like
03:17:38 Like printed because there's like like a paper shortage and um
03:17:42 A lot of these industries are still recovered from the I mean, they're very ones I could cover from the pandemic
03:17:48 and um
03:17:51 Like I'm gonna say um back when I interned they
03:17:54 I noticed that um
03:17:57 A handful of like the things they published
03:18:00 Like um had kick starters and I the idea is that you kick start
03:18:05 You kick start the book to kind of like make sure like any any loss the publisher will get
03:18:11 Is covered for the Kickstarter
03:18:16 Is that why?
03:18:18 Yeah, that's why they would say yes to it. I thought it was more like if if it's like shown to be
03:18:23 They like if they like the book if they like the book sure. Yeah, I mean, okay, that's to be popular but
03:18:30 Because I think it's a one specific like series where they where I when I picked it up. I saw that it's like, oh, this was made
03:18:36 with Kickstarter
03:18:38 But I remember like reading the pitch for it. So I was like, I assume it's a combination of them liking the book
03:18:43 But also the Kickstarter like covering for losses
03:18:46 Yeah, like like having some sort of security for the publisher to say yeah, we'll try this
03:18:52 I mean, I think what the go-to is that like if if it's like popular enough you you can like
03:18:59 Approach publishers about it. Oh man. I really want to like
03:19:02 Talk to you talking about a kick you talking about a Kickstarter book
03:19:06 The idea of like using Kickstarter to get a publisher interested in your work
03:19:11 Yeah
03:19:12 because um
03:19:13 Yeah, I just mentioned about how like I think they told me that like
03:19:18 Certain Kickstarter's are made to like make sure that any losses the publisher's gonna get is like covered
03:19:24 by the Kickstarter
03:19:26 Yeah, I mean that like
03:19:29 Isn't wasn't mighty number nine something like that
03:19:31 Like they didn't like the amount of money that they raised on Kickstarter was like
03:19:36 Definitely not what actually funded the game
03:19:39 Yeah, it was like it wasn't it that um my number nine was like half of it
03:19:45 Uh, I can't remember
03:19:46 I I mean, I heard that before I mean, I know that was the case with like Shovel Knight was that like the Kickstarter was gonna pay for half of it
03:19:54 And the other half would be like a publisher
03:19:57 Or I don't know again, whatever the fuck they're called a video game
03:20:01 I don't know as long as you as long as you um fulfill the
03:20:05 Promises you make on your Kickstarter. I mean, I don't see any reason why
03:20:09 A publisher can't also
03:20:11 Yeah, I mean, I mean my goal is that I'm hoping this becomes popular enough that if there's a volume two
03:20:18 We'll have like a publisher who'll cover like half of the cost
03:20:21 And then the Kickstarter could just focus on
03:20:24 Getting like the artist paid because I do want I I would want the three thousand to be consistent
03:20:31 Would would it so like it never feel like anyone's getting jibbed
03:20:35 and like
03:20:36 Um, if we do get like a publisher like set it up where like artists get like royalties
03:20:42 Or their story continued to be published, you know
03:20:46 It's a lot. It's a lot of fucking wishful thinking
03:20:49 I wish I had a publisher. Yeah, that's that's it. That's it's tough. Um
03:20:53 The only recent success story that I fucking heard it was um
03:20:57 What's the name of the guy who created uh
03:21:00 Mr. Boop
03:21:02 Oh, Alan Robbins. Yeah, like Robbins. Yeah, because um, he he self published the the first like
03:21:08 He self published like all the Mr. Boop comics and then he got picked up by a publisher
03:21:15 But the publisher instead of doing like
03:21:18 um
03:21:19 Separate books like he did they just published the one collection together
03:21:23 And I seen that like done before like um, there's a comic that I like called copra that like
03:21:29 Originally they were going to be published through like I because the guy was making the comic for like a years now
03:21:35 And um, he was just self publishing like he had this whole system on etsy where people would for you
03:21:40 People would join like the subscription on etsy. So these are the people guaranteed to get copies when they're finished
03:21:46 Um, and he and he did image comics, but then um, he left image comics. Well, he like
03:21:51 He decided he didn't want to do like single issues through image comics because um
03:21:56 he fucking
03:21:58 During the pandemic, he fucking saw Todd McFarland like trying to do a Kickstarter for a spawn figure
03:22:04 And it's like what the fuck are you doing, man? I thought you had a whole ass company that handles this
03:22:08 And you're fucking doing a Kickstarter for a spawn figure. That's that's kind of like
03:22:12 That's kind of like iffy
03:22:15 so I just looked I just looked up um
03:22:17 I just googled mr. Boop to see if like any like if there was like a Kickstarter for it or anything
03:22:23 And I found an article about it and it includes this photo and caption of ally
03:22:28 Cartoonist alec robbins eating chipotle. Well dressed in sonic badge
03:22:32 Photo courtesy of alec robbins. Amazingly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good
03:22:37 Base king move. Uh, yeah, his collection is published by sober sprocket and they're they're the same company who published um
03:22:45 Pinky and pepper forever
03:22:47 Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah, they were they were actually the publisher. I was gonna try to approach the um for the comic that I mean
03:22:54 Pinky and pepper was made by that girl
03:22:57 Um, they they transitioned to a man recently
03:23:00 As of like last year they go by eddie adams now
03:23:04 Eddie adams. What name did they use to go there? Well, they're dead. Not their dead name is ivy adams
03:23:10 Oh god, I thought you were gonna say they were dead. I thought you were saying like they died
03:23:13 No, there's no they they read like a car accident and they got like brain damage or something, right?
03:23:17 They um, yeah, they had an accident because they're on one of those like like scooter things that you could pay for
03:23:23 And um, they did get yeah, I think they did get some brain damage or something. I mean, I talked to them
03:23:28 I talked to them before and after
03:23:30 Right or no way. I think I only ever talked to them
03:23:33 I can't remember. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wait, what you say it again. What was the dead name? Because I I
03:23:39 Ivy adams
03:23:40 I yes, okay. I remember right eddie. Okay. They go by eddie adams now
03:23:45 Yeah, okay, but that was the pinkie and pepper first. Yeah, they're the one who did pinkie and pepper
03:23:52 Which is a good ass book by the way, if people out there haven't read it
03:23:56 Um, but yeah, I was gonna approach silver sprocket about the whole the new yori
03:24:01 Uh comic, I mean like
03:24:04 I kind of do want to do a thing like mr. Boop where it's like all online and we could like
03:24:10 Like I mean read it for free and buy it too
03:24:14 Or maybe do a Kickstarter deal where like we cover half of it and they cover the other half
03:24:20 Um, it's all it's all like so it's also like hard and you don't exactly know what you're gonna get because there's so many like fucking like
03:24:27 um
03:24:30 Like I
03:24:31 You guys never heard of uh
03:24:33 There's like a manga called devils candy
03:24:35 And it was like it used to be a webcomic. I heard of it
03:24:38 Yeah, and it was a really it's a really good-looking comic like it looks like a manga, right?
03:24:43 And um, they they they were just self publishing their webcomic and I've been so recently they got to deal with like this media and now they have like
03:24:50 total total bonds of like their their webcomic
03:24:54 and like
03:24:55 It's I mean, it's just publishing. It's just a physical copy of the webcomic. You read for free, but you know
03:25:03 Like that's a whole another market you're entering now because like not all people who who read manga
03:25:09 Are gonna read webcomics, right?
03:25:17 It's so hard to make ends meet you may as well end it all
03:25:22 Oh
03:25:25 I can't end it all I have shit to do tomorrow
03:25:28 Yeah
03:25:30 You might as well end some of it. No
03:25:33 Continue everything. Yeah, cut off your leg every year. You then you're not
03:25:38 Cut off your leg every year and it'll grow back
03:25:41 That's true. That's that's why this is why I make five comics at the same time because it's all
03:25:47 It's all me throwing different things out there. Like let's see what catches on
03:25:51 Oh, yeah, I'm kind of bad about that
03:25:53 I'm like focused so creatively like like on one thing
03:25:57 I'm like, ah Clarissa gunsmokes the coolest thing ever very very slowly making progress on it and eventually it'll be a thing
03:26:04 And then if nobody cares, I'm like, okay
03:26:11 Uh, and I start something you but like I could be like throwing stuff out there. That's like less
03:26:20 less focused less not like worse but like
03:26:25 I have so many ideas and I'm like in my head. I'm like, okay
03:26:28 I'll do them one at a time and I'll build up a huge repertoire of cool comics that I have
03:26:34 I guess I'm just doing it too slow. I gotta be like
03:26:38 Throwing them. I gotta be throwing them around. Hey, what?
03:26:42 You know how I said that my internet's really bad and sometimes it stops working and I can't
03:26:47 well
03:26:48 Okay, get this it's happening right now. I can't load any websites. It tells me I'm not connected to the internet
03:26:55 That's because I can hear you. Yeah. Yeah, I'm in the call. I'm in this call on the internet
03:27:03 What that's weird. I can't load Imgir. I can't load Imgir. It thinks I'm no internet try
03:27:09 What the fuck someone's lying
03:27:12 Someone's lying
03:27:14 Maybe discord is taking all your bandwidth
03:27:18 Maybe maybe that would be
03:27:22 Because this score takes like a lot of space in your computer
03:27:26 I notice I just don't I just don't understand
03:27:30 I just I just don't okay. So anyway, I'm doing this kickstarter on the 19th
03:27:36 So watch out watch out gamers
03:27:39 On the night. Yes
03:27:41 That's uh 13 days after voting day
03:27:45 Here in boston we got a vote for
03:27:50 governor
03:27:52 I think you got a vote for someone
03:27:55 now we we voted for governor like uh
03:27:58 A couple months ago
03:28:00 We voted for mayor a few months ago now. I've got to do now. We got to do the governor. I think
03:28:10 So sick, I'm literally sick and tired
03:28:14 Oh boy
03:28:15 Yeah, being an artist is is hard. I wish there was a way for me to like, I don't know
03:28:20 Gamble my art using a vile towel currency or something
03:28:25 If only I could uh
03:28:27 You should mint
03:28:29 every
03:28:30 Page of the comic as an nft. You should uh every pixel every individual pixel of every page as an nft
03:28:38 That's like a billion
03:28:40 And if you if you increase the this canvas size, you know, like change the dpa. There's more pixels to go around
03:28:46 There's more things to to mint
03:28:49 That's right. Yeah, that's right on tier tier five of clown milk
03:28:54 You get you get to choose which page you want to mint
03:28:57 I know how you can hit you can hit $10,000 by selling 100 copies if you include if you also pay extra
03:29:04 You get an nft
03:29:05 Of the book
03:29:06 You get the physical book this nft is a receipt for the physical book if the book is destroyed you will retain the nft
03:29:13 therefore
03:29:14 It's still got you know, it's it's protected forever. You could so read the comp. Well, you can't but you can only
03:29:20 Yeah, you can't read it. There's the
03:29:22 It doesn't contain the the book
03:29:24 But uh, you know, I I I minted my whole family as an nft
03:29:28 And even though my house burned down and they all died tragically, you know, it's actually fine because I still retain the asset
03:29:35 They live they live eternally on the blockchain. They live eternally on the block. Exactly
03:29:40 Exactly selling selling my deceased family members as nfts to pay rent
03:29:47 Well, you you know, you should have as many children as possible. So if you're low on cash you can mint all of them
03:29:54 And like as you mint their child, they're like they're turning into pixels like any suck to the computer. They're like, no
03:30:01 No dad, what's going on? I'm scared
03:30:04 father
03:30:06 father help
03:30:08 father help
03:30:09 Be beautiful
03:30:12 Sorry ben jr
03:30:14 But we we really we really need to cut we really fucking need hbo max and i'm low on cash right now
03:30:21 I don't put me in the blockchain. No, don't don't put me in the blockchain. Please
03:30:29 I'm just imagining loads of children in little crates connected by chains
03:30:35 That are like suspended in some weird home stuck like uh, there's
03:30:40 Bed thing. You know those chains?
03:30:43 Oh, yes. Yes
03:30:45 That's what the blockchain is
03:30:48 I'm picturing it like um, you know at the end of scott pilgrim when uh, gideon has all the the the women in like those pods
03:30:56 Yeah
03:30:57 It's like that. I don't know it's frozen in stasis
03:31:02 Interesting
03:31:03 I guess there's no there's no chain there
03:31:06 No, the durst chain is better better. Yeah
03:31:10 Uh, what do we think I think we think we want to maybe call it here. We've been going for a long time
03:31:15 I think I think we're good right here
03:31:18 Yeah
03:31:19 Uh, we had no and you know what no voicemail. We're free of the curse of voicemail
03:31:24 Yeah, dead. We've already answered the questions. We can just stop
03:31:28 You can stop anytime we want. Um
03:31:31 Now you gotta bring you gotta bring back topics to replace voicemail
03:31:35 Like after the voicemails we start a topic
03:31:41 We kind of did that
03:31:43 Today's topic is um
03:31:45 Eight hour videos eight hour videos eight hour videos like them hate them
03:31:51 Only when they're eight hours eight minutes and 88 seconds. Wait, you can't have 88. Yeah. Oh, you know what?
03:31:57 Sucks so they're bad. Okay. They're all they're all bad. It's gotta be um
03:32:02 five hour videos
03:32:04 That are
03:32:05 Exactly that are like you can play a little number games 55 minutes and 55 seconds. Yeah
03:32:13 Ruining the bit by making it eight hours
03:32:16 Well, no by making it nine hours
03:32:19 uh
03:32:20 28 minutes
03:32:22 and then plus
03:32:24 I can't do the math
03:32:25 29 minutes and uh
03:32:29 And in 28 seconds, which would be equivalent to eight hours 88 minutes and 88 seconds. I think
03:32:35 So, uh, yeah, look forward to make any sense
03:32:39 Look forward to my five hour response. So you need to name a source is the independent of nft video
03:32:45 You should do you should make a response. You should make an eight second response
03:32:49 Yeah
03:32:51 You should go through it. No, you should go through it frame by frame and do like a like a e uh e-fap
03:32:57 E like an e-fap Jenny Nicholson like
03:33:00 29 hour response to the eight hour to the eight hour video
