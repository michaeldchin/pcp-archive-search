00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:16 The show on the internet about a bunch of people who make stuff talking about stuff.
00:00:21 I'm the best guy ever, and today we're joined by Digibro.
00:00:25 I'm alive, for you, I'm alive, for you, I'm alive, I'm alive, for me, we're all alive.
00:00:43 That's true.
00:00:44 Which after our podcast yesterday, Mumkey, that's a good sign.
00:00:47 I can't believe it.
00:00:48 That's very true.
00:00:49 Though this will be a week and one day when this goes up, but no matter.
00:00:53 Okay, let's get right to it.
00:00:55 Alright people, topic for today, incest.
00:00:58 Uh oh.
00:00:59 We're talking about incest.
00:01:00 That's what it is.
00:01:01 So let me get, let's get some dictionary definitions off of the urban dictionary, of course.
00:01:05 Okay, there's two dictionary definitions that are good for this.
00:01:08 Okay, first one.
00:01:09 Having sex with members of one's own family, fine.
00:01:12 And the second one is, it's very direct, the way the British royal family keeps itself
00:01:17 permanent.
00:01:18 I like that a lot.
00:01:20 One of the few times the urban dictionary was actually funny.
00:01:24 Yeah, they did it good this time.
00:01:27 Well shit, fam.
00:01:28 Let's just launch into it.
00:01:29 Literally, fam.
00:01:30 Oh yeah, that's true.
00:01:33 Very well said.
00:01:34 Um, okay, where do we start with this?
00:01:37 I do want to say that I'm the one who said we have to do this episode because two weeks
00:01:41 ago we had the fetish cast and all the comments were bitching, Mumkey, why didn't you talk
00:01:46 about your fetish is Mumkey?
00:01:48 I said, fuck it.
00:01:49 You know what?
00:01:50 Let's just do a whole goddamn episode about incest so I can just get it all out there.
00:01:55 So I beg completed and got this to happen.
00:01:58 And I was also demanded to be on this by Mumkey.
00:02:02 So Mumkey, since you wanted to, since this is your podcast and you tend to get short
00:02:07 changed on the dialogue in these, why don't you give us the big intro?
00:02:10 Oh boy.
00:02:11 Well, I do have a big incest related story about my personal life that I've been waiting
00:02:16 to tell if we want to just start off with that or if we want to wait for later.
00:02:20 Let's do it.
00:02:21 Now, let's do it now.
00:02:22 Oh, okay.
00:02:23 Okay, folks, this is going to take us all the way back to my freshman year of high school.
00:02:27 The story of how incest changed my life forever in a either positive or negative way that'll
00:02:33 be up to the viewer to decide.
00:02:37 First of all, the question for you folks at home, let's go around the horn.
00:02:40 And I mean, you guys, not the fucking audience because I can't reply.
00:02:44 Do you think it's okay?
00:02:45 And I was under the impression that it is okay after reading Harry Potter.
00:02:49 Do you think it's okay to date your best friend's siblings?
00:02:54 That's a tough one.
00:02:55 Yes.
00:02:56 You know, it's a sticky situation.
00:02:59 Is it possible to do it right?
00:03:01 Yes.
00:03:02 It is possible.
00:03:03 It can be done.
00:03:04 I mean, I think it's definitely okay.
00:03:05 But if your best friend has a problem with it, then it's going to cause friction in your
00:03:09 relationship.
00:03:10 Yeah.
00:03:11 Like, yeah.
00:03:12 My siblings who won't care.
00:03:13 Yeah.
00:03:14 Go ahead.
00:03:15 Fuck my sister.
00:03:16 I don't give a shit.
00:03:17 Well, that was one of those situations.
00:03:18 I was in.
00:03:19 I was a freshman.
00:03:20 My girlfriend was a year younger and we met because I my best friend to, I guess, will
00:03:25 call Harper because I have a Harper Lee book right in front of me.
00:03:30 So my best friend Harper, you're older.
00:03:32 Is it to kill a mockingbird by chance?
00:03:34 No, it's to go to the only two because I stole a copy of Ghost at a Watchman from the
00:03:41 store I was working at because I was like, oh, there's a bunch of controversy.
00:03:43 I wonder if this is even worth it.
00:03:45 And then I never even opened it.
00:03:46 I just have it sitting on my shelf to kill it turns out it's the prequel actually.
00:03:51 Yeah.
00:03:52 Well, I guess Finch a little bit racist, a little bit racist.
00:03:55 It's not actually a prequel.
00:03:56 It's like the original incarnation of to kill a mockingbird that she wrote and realized
00:04:01 it was shit and then scrapped it and used the same characters to write a better book
00:04:05 because in this one scout is like an adult, even though scouts like a child and to kill
00:04:09 a mockingbird.
00:04:10 But enough about that.
00:04:11 There's no Atticus scout incest unless you go to a certain part of Tumblr, which I have
00:04:17 definitely been to.
00:04:19 So I'm dating my best friend's younger sister, two years younger than him.
00:04:24 I'm just picturing Scout now.
00:04:25 You're dating Scout.
00:04:26 I'm dating Scouts.
00:04:27 Very tomboyish.
00:04:28 Yes.
00:04:29 And her older brother, Bo, Bo is, you know, not in appreciating this.
00:04:32 Are you picturing like your imagination of Scout from reading the book or like the movie
00:04:37 version of Scout?
00:04:38 My imagination.
00:04:39 Like this little girl with like a bob cut and stuff.
00:04:42 Yeah.
00:04:43 Okay.
00:04:44 Okay.
00:04:45 So, you know, me and the girl, we're dating and like, I'm 15 and she's 14.
00:04:48 So she doesn't really want to do any of, you know, the sexy stuff.
00:04:51 Like we can kiss, we can hold hands, we can hang out, but she don't want to touch that
00:04:55 dick.
00:04:56 She don't want to show me those titties.
00:04:57 She don't want to let me go cave exploring if you know what I mean.
00:05:01 So imagine my surprise towards the end of the relationship.
00:05:05 I find out that this girl has cheated on me, not only with my best friend, but with
00:05:12 her own brother.
00:05:14 Whoa.
00:05:15 Whoa.
00:05:16 Dang.
00:05:17 So that's two major betrayals, girlfriend cheating on you and also, oh yeah, my best
00:05:23 friend slept with my girlfriend or whatever the fuck.
00:05:27 They actually fucked them.
00:05:28 They didn't sleep together.
00:05:29 Oh, okay.
00:05:30 Okay.
00:05:31 So that's two major hurdles for you to get over.
00:05:33 What did they do if not sleep together?
00:05:35 Well, that's the thing.
00:05:36 The third thing is, you know, I'm always, you know, you know me, I'm a pushing guy.
00:05:39 So hey, how about you touch my dick today?
00:05:41 Yeah, I don't want to.
00:05:42 I don't want to do that.
00:05:43 So I find out that she gave her own brother a big old handy in the living room down when
00:05:50 the parents are upstairs sleeping, give him a big old handy, make him come all over her
00:05:54 hand, show off those titties.
00:05:56 Me, what does Mumkey get?
00:05:57 Not a damn thing.
00:05:58 I guess she only likes her relatives because I didn't get shit.
00:06:02 I can only assume where this is going.
00:06:05 Because I know where my mind is going is that you jacked off to this image forever, like
00:06:10 ever since this is all you've thought about.
00:06:15 It was heartbreaking and it was demented and I'm still friends to, I guess, Beau Harper
00:06:20 Lee Bow, whatever we're calling him to this day.
00:06:24 And I don't talk to that bitch because, oh boy, do I want to go and I guess I have to.
00:06:28 I guess I have to.
00:06:30 It was, it ruined everybody's life.
00:06:32 It ruined everybody's life.
00:06:34 Because she told this to me like out of guilt or something and nobody else knew.
00:06:42 And the other important part of the story is that their Mum is the most hardcore Christian
00:06:48 woman in the entire world and we would all hang out because every Wednesday after school
00:06:53 we would go to their place like a big group of friends and then they would take us to
00:06:58 church and we would do like the Wednesday night church thing.
00:07:01 And I was already well into my atheist years but I went just because it was fun and we
00:07:06 did not do any of the church things, we just fucked around because it was great.
00:07:11 So I'm like, okay, this Mum is probably not going to be okay with this happening.
00:07:17 So I guess I'll tell somebody who can tell somebody to tell her because I'm not letting
00:07:21 this go by, baby.
00:07:24 Also there was like a speech competition sort of thing through the church where like all
00:07:30 these church people would go to like the big arena area in downtown Des Moines.
00:07:37 Did you do a speech about how this girl gave her brother a hand job?
00:07:40 No.
00:07:41 Is that how you're going with this?
00:07:42 So like by speech I mean like it's different types of performances so you can do skits,
00:07:45 you can do music or whatever.
00:07:47 And me and Harper Lee, we did an atheist duo Christian rap performance and the judges
00:07:56 fucking loved it and we wanted trip to Michigan because we were so good and then right after
00:08:01 all of this emerges and the Mum finds out and fucking places both of them in solitary
00:08:05 confinement and like sets up nanny cams all throughout their house to make sure that their
00:08:09 kids aren't fucking anymore.
00:08:12 And so I lost myself a trip to Michigan and she wouldn't let us go because of this.
00:08:16 Hang on, did you do the rap thing with the girl or with the guy?
00:08:19 With the guy.
00:08:20 Okay, that's what I thought.
00:08:21 Women don't have talents.
00:08:22 I still know the lyrics if you want to hear a little bit of it.
00:08:25 Yeah, yeah.
00:08:27 Jesus the one turned a fish into a ton, turned water into wine and he also healed the blind
00:08:31 by just spitting in the dirt it can make blind eyes work.
00:08:34 If you got a problem he could do a miracle for you.
00:08:38 And that's most of it.
00:08:39 Hell yeah.
00:08:40 The crowd was pumped, they were fucking chanting and dancing and shit and then the black judge
00:08:46 said yo that's some good shit and we wanted trip to Michigan.
00:08:51 And that man went on to be Kanye West.
00:08:53 What were you going to do in Michigan?
00:08:56 So it was like the regional part of the contest and then Michigan was like the nationals where
00:09:00 we would perform our rap in front of like with all the other rappers.
00:09:04 We're like these two pasty wide guys who aren't even Christian doing this shit.
00:09:11 Man what a tale, what a yarn.
00:09:13 So you're still friends with Harper, did I assume you would know if this ever happened
00:09:21 again?
00:09:23 Does he still fuck his sister?
00:09:24 Well the thing is after this came out and the mom fucking laid down the hammer that
00:09:29 girl is now the most sheltered, like hidden from the society, hardcore Christian person
00:09:36 I've ever encountered and I don't even think I could speak to her.
00:09:39 I would have expected the reverse, I would have expected her to go like full fucking
00:09:44 slut or something.
00:09:45 No I think they went pretty hard on her, I think that the parents fucking ended her
00:09:50 life after that shit.
00:09:52 See this is good because this ties into our larger discussion of incest.
00:09:55 No one's life should be you know in a major way curtailed or changed just because they
00:10:02 happen to give their brother a hand job one time.
00:10:05 It's not that big a deal everybody, it's all, we could all relax about that shit.
00:10:09 Well I'm curious right now, I know Monkey's an only child, I have a younger brother, oh
00:10:14 that's right.
00:10:15 Pachi, of course.
00:10:16 Why do I keep forgetting about Pachi?
00:10:17 You've got a younger brother, I've got two younger brothers.
00:10:19 Nate's got an older brother, a younger sister, Tom you've got two younger sisters, right?
00:10:25 So most of us, I feel like there's gonna be a big difference in like the perception of
00:10:31 incest between me and Monkey and Nate and Tom.
00:10:35 Yeah I definitely think so.
00:10:37 I'm sure that's true.
00:10:39 And I also think that it comes like your perception of it is not just affected by like whether
00:10:44 or not you have siblings with the opposite sex but also just like how close you are with
00:10:48 your family and in general.
00:10:50 So I'm very curious to hear- I think I might surprise you, what we'll say, yeah.
00:10:54 I want to know, as I know, well anyway, I want to hear from Tom first.
00:11:03 What do you think of this, because I don't know what you're coming into this with at
00:11:05 all.
00:11:06 Yeah, I mean, I guess as someone who has two sisters I can't even fathom doing that, like
00:11:13 you know, I mean, I don't have any attraction to them, they're good people, I'd go to war
00:11:19 for them if they needed me but I wouldn't do that, sorry.
00:11:22 Well just so we're clear, I mean, you know, only some of us have sisters but we've all
00:11:26 got a mother, we've all got a mother everybody.
00:11:28 See that's where I draw the line.
00:11:30 Not the best relationship with this mom though.
00:11:32 That's true, that's true.
00:11:33 And all that sexual tension dude, you know, it's, uh, shut the fuck up.
00:11:37 Well the thing is, I don't think any of us would fuck any of our actual family but I
00:11:46 think the way that you feel about your family affects how interested you are in incest porn.
00:11:52 So like I'm wondering, Tom, do you like incest porn at all, any of the different relationships?
00:12:00 I don't find any of that particularly arousing or interesting.
00:12:08 I've seen incest stuff and to me it's completely, I guess it's just neutral because my view
00:12:13 on incest in general is that I feel like we just need to stay out of people's bedrooms
00:12:18 in general as long as there's consent, that's fine, I don't really care, it's not my business
00:12:24 and I don't see the harm in it, I think there's way worse things to do than to fuck a family
00:12:28 member if they're both consenting and of age.
00:12:31 I mean, yeah people are gonna think it's fucked up, sure but I don't really care, if that's
00:12:36 what you wanna do, that's what you wanna do, if you can fuck dudes who are women, why can't
00:12:40 you, that seems relatively banal in the grand scheme of things that we've allowed to become
00:12:45 culturally accepted.
00:12:47 So I don't see any sort of controversy about it, I think probably if you wanted to have
00:12:54 a kid with a family member, that's when I'd start to draw the line because then you're
00:12:57 talking about genetic issues at some point.
00:13:01 Whenever I bring that up, people always tell me that like, oh actually it's not really
00:13:04 that common, it's a pretty unlikely thing and you know, at some point, we're kind of
00:13:09 making a calculation, are we prepared to enforce a rule to say yes, you should not have kids
00:13:14 with your siblings because there is an increased likelihood of genetic problems or whatever,
00:13:21 but is that really our business, if they wanna have a fucked up retar baby?
00:13:26 I mean, we definitely let people with genetic problems have kids.
00:13:30 Okay, here's the thing, we let stupid people breed.
00:13:33 Why do we allow that?
00:13:35 Yeah, that's the thing.
00:13:36 Well, here's the thing, I don't think it should be illegal, but I think it's ethically irresponsible,
00:13:46 so I guess you have to make the distinction between what do I find personally ethically
00:13:52 wrong to do and what do I think should be legally prevented.
00:13:58 If you have, I don't know a good example, I don't know if Down syndrome or anything
00:14:03 is hereditary, but if you had something like that and there was an equal chance you were
00:14:09 gonna pass it on to your kids as incest has of a genetic defect, do you think it's also
00:14:15 ethically irresponsible to have kids if you have Down syndrome or something of that nature?
00:14:20 You know, is it unethical to have a child with Down syndrome like at all?
00:14:26 Because that is a person who's alive and can live and stuff, so it's not like it's
00:14:30 like evil to have a person with that and they're pretty much just gonna live their life and
00:14:34 probably not really hurt anybody and die, but they're kind of like a burden on the state
00:14:38 or on their parents, on their parents, I guess, but there's nothing like immoral about it,
00:14:42 it's just like we don't really want to incentivize it, I guess, you know?
00:14:46 Maybe, I guess at the same time though, it's like this is a person who has no say in even
00:14:53 being born in the first place and it's like-
00:14:55 True, true.
00:14:56 You're purposely and knowingly hobbling them with a lifelong incurable condition and like
00:15:01 do you have more responsibility to do something about that because like it's not just you
00:15:08 saying like I'm prepared to deal with the consequences of having to raise a child with
00:15:12 this condition, it's like I am willingly, you know, kneecapping them with this condition
00:15:17 and I know it's going to happen, it's going to make their life more difficult and I'm
00:15:20 gonna do it anyways.
00:15:22 You know, just to make that question even more frustrating and complicated, like it's
00:15:26 not exactly like if you do one thing, you'll have a baby who like might-
00:15:33 Okay, like if you have the genetic potential for Down syndrome and like you have sex or
00:15:38 you have a kid with someone else who is also likely to have that and then you have a kid
00:15:41 with Down syndrome versus like if you have sex with somebody else who that's less likely
00:15:45 and then you don't, it's not actually like you're changing the baby that was born, it's
00:15:50 that you're just making a different baby.
00:15:51 So actually in like the moral implications of that are that what you're doing is you're
00:15:55 sort of just choosing to not give life to one person who would just live a life with
00:16:00 Down syndrome and you're instead choosing to give life to a totally different, separate
00:16:04 person since like, you know, the same sperm won't probably be the thing that impregnates
00:16:09 the same egg.
00:16:10 This is fucking with my head dude, like, this is like a really philosophical way of thinking
00:16:16 about childbirth that I've never considered and it's fucking with my mind.
00:16:22 That's me baby.
00:16:23 It's a lot to think about, it's a complicated multi-layered issue because like the ethical
00:16:28 ramifications of taking a position are complicated.
00:16:32 Every woman you don't have a kid with is a kid you are choosing not to exist.
00:16:38 It's true.
00:16:39 It's true.
00:16:40 Interesting.
00:16:41 By the way, let me just, I don't mind being totally clear on here, I fucking love incest
00:16:46 in my porn, I'm so all about it, I think it's great in most of its forms.
00:16:51 I like Mother-Son, I like siblings, not as much into Daddy-Daughter, that can get a
00:16:57 little strange.
00:16:58 That's the interesting, that's why I was interested in leading up to this podcast because we've
00:17:03 discussed incest plenty of times in the chat and we were talking about it in there.
00:17:07 You like Mother-Son and I like Daddy-Daughter, but not so much the opposite in both of our
00:17:14 cases.
00:17:15 Yeah, I would like to hear this from both of you because I'm into siblings and cousins,
00:17:20 but when it comes to parents, I think it is horrifying, so I would like to hear both
00:17:24 of you justify this.
00:17:26 It's the fantasy.
00:17:27 It's the fantasy.
00:17:28 I don't mean you're going to fuck your mom, Nate, I just want to know what is, is there
00:17:31 any logical thing behind it?
00:17:33 Before we do that though, Monkey, when you think siblings, who do you want to be the
00:17:38 older one?
00:17:39 Boy or girl?
00:17:40 Doesn't matter.
00:17:41 Doesn't matter at all?
00:17:42 Okay.
00:17:43 Both have their benefits.
00:17:44 I like the big sister.
00:17:45 I definitely like the Onesan or whatever.
00:17:47 Okay, because I'm more into little sister for the same reasons, I think, as I am into
00:17:51 Daddy-Daughter.
00:17:52 What's interesting to me about that, Nate, is, and I think I know, this is the best logic
00:17:59 I can come up with and this is going to sound real gay for both of us, but I'm an older
00:18:06 brother and you're a younger brother and you're closest with Ben, I'm closest with Victor,
00:18:12 you know?
00:18:13 Yeah.
00:18:14 Yeah.
00:18:15 Yeah.
00:18:16 So you're the Daddy and I'm the son in this sort of, in this-
00:18:19 No, what I'm saying is that you would be interested in older sisters because of the fact that
00:18:24 you were closest with your older brother and maybe you've always had, in your mind, what
00:18:29 if my older sibling who cares for me and stuff was actually a hot chick I could fuck, you
00:18:37 know?
00:18:38 Yeah.
00:18:39 Because that's how I think of little-
00:18:40 Sure.
00:18:41 Like, if my little brothers were a hot chick I could fuck, like how much better would my
00:18:44 life have been, you know?
00:18:46 That makes sense to me.
00:18:47 Yeah.
00:18:48 Well, see, that's kind of what-
00:18:49 That's a sound bite right there.
00:18:50 That's what I was going to say that I like about, like, mother and son stuff.
00:18:54 What I like about the mother and son stuff is that it's actually pretty similar to the
00:18:59 older sister thing.
00:19:00 It's that like, okay, so you're just going about your life and you've got a mom and
00:19:04 like, she's a woman, you know?
00:19:06 She's always a woman and that doesn't change and it's like, always below the surface is
00:19:11 this question that like, you know, we totally could fuck.
00:19:13 We totally could fuck if we wanted to, you know?
00:19:15 No, it's not.
00:19:16 I'm trying to say, is that?
00:19:17 I've never-
00:19:18 Well, no.
00:19:19 It means it's possible.
00:19:20 It means it's possible.
00:19:21 God damn it.
00:19:22 God damn it.
00:19:23 You keep saying you when I think you're talking about us.
00:19:24 You keep saying you when I think you're talking about us.
00:19:25 Well, I can't speak for you guys, but it's not, you know-
00:19:27 Please don't.
00:19:29 It's the fact that like, there's a woman just in your life all the time and society says,
00:19:34 you're totally not allowed to fuck her, but then you could.
00:19:37 You totally could.
00:19:38 And I'm saying you in the sense of in this fantasy, you know, hentai verse.
00:19:42 And that's it.
00:19:43 Which is similar to like, the older sister thing.
00:19:45 And like, you know, there's like the, it's a little different, like the old, the mom
00:19:48 thing is more like, oh, dad's always away.
00:19:50 No one's here to satisfy me.
00:19:52 I'm a woman.
00:19:53 I have needs, blah, blah, blah.
00:19:54 Then they fuck their son.
00:19:55 Whereas with the older sister, it's more like, the sister, I always picture like Kesha when
00:19:58 I think about this.
00:19:59 Like, oh, she-
00:20:00 She's like-
00:20:01 A black woman?
00:20:02 Kesha is white, dude.
00:20:03 Kesha's white, dude.
00:20:04 Oh.
00:20:05 She's fucking Mick Jagger's daughter.
00:20:06 She's fucking a number sign in her name.
00:20:08 I thought it was a black person.
00:20:10 I think so.
00:20:11 Let me double, I could be wrong about that, but, but like the point is like, she comes
00:20:14 bombing and drunk from the club.
00:20:15 I'm getting a hard no from someone who knows Kesha.
00:20:18 Okay.
00:20:19 All right.
00:20:20 Fine.
00:20:21 Maybe I'm wrong.
00:20:22 But so she comes bombing in from the club.
00:20:23 She just collapsed on the ground.
00:20:25 She's like, yeah, I was out just like clubbing and, and I'm such a slut.
00:20:29 Look at me.
00:20:30 And she's like, you're trying to impress her little brother and little brother's like,
00:20:32 oh, whatever, dude.
00:20:33 And she's just like, no, you don't understand.
00:20:34 Like I do this because, because I want to get your attention, I want to get your attention
00:20:37 because you're always there.
00:20:38 You're the guy who I really want to impress.
00:20:40 And then they fuck.
00:20:41 And that's, you know, I, I, I, uh, I don't dislike like mother son or sister, older
00:20:49 sister, but like if it's older sister in both cases, I prefer if the son is like at
00:20:56 least a teenager.
00:20:58 Oh, yeah.
00:20:59 I can't stand the show to shit.
00:21:01 Yeah.
00:21:02 Like, because it's always those tiny dicks don't do it for me.
00:21:05 The tiny dicks don't do it.
00:21:07 And just like the woman being like just like massive and smothering, like that's definitely
00:21:11 a different fetish is like just wanting to be like tiny and to just be like encompassed
00:21:17 by a woman like how in those ones, it's always like a little show to and then like a mom or
00:21:22 sister with like just giant tits and like a huge thick body that's just like covering
00:21:27 the little boy to the point of like, you know, and that I feel like is a whole different
00:21:32 thing.
00:21:33 That just reminded me that after the fetish episode, somebody did make art of hippo as
00:21:39 Jesus in the pieta and it's really great.
00:21:41 Oh, yeah.
00:21:42 It does.
00:21:43 I don't hippo is listening into this podcast.
00:21:45 Yeah.
00:21:46 I don't know if he wants to be in, but I've gotten the impression he's more into show
00:21:50 to than we are because he seems to like those big women.
00:21:54 So I think yeah.
00:21:55 He likes the big encompassing women it seems like so he can type in the chat if that's
00:21:59 how he feels.
00:22:00 I'm not entirely sure.
00:22:01 Yeah, there you go.
00:22:03 It's good.
00:22:04 There you go.
00:22:05 Okay.
00:22:06 You've got the word the official word from on high.
00:22:07 He's good.
00:22:08 Everybody.
00:22:09 We've got confirmation.
00:22:10 Yeah.
00:22:11 Hey, Nate, I have a question for you since you don't like a mother's son.
00:22:15 I do.
00:22:16 I do like.
00:22:17 Okay.
00:22:18 Well, since you do as a kid, did you watch Malcolm in the middle?
00:22:21 I did.
00:22:22 I did very much because as a kid watching that in the way that Lois would terrorize her sons,
00:22:27 I think that is what scared me away from ever even thinking about something like that
00:22:32 because it's terrifying.
00:22:33 Well, you know what?
00:22:35 Okay.
00:22:36 I feel like with something like that, I don't feel like that even necessarily would have
00:22:39 like drawn me away from it because the whole thing is like, this is like a fantasy.
00:22:43 But like, like what if like my mother was like this, like super hot slut and she needs
00:22:49 sex desperately and I'm a man, God damn it.
00:22:52 Like, you know, like you're putting yourself in this, in this fictional situation where
00:22:55 like if your mother was like this kind of person, then you know, it would be sexy times.
00:23:01 Okay.
00:23:02 You know, so yeah.
00:23:03 So it's like a departure.
00:23:04 So I can see why like seeing a like a female, not role model, but like a female character
00:23:08 or like a mother specifically acting in that way, like as like a terrorizing, you know,
00:23:12 bitch of a mom would, would like turn someone off.
00:23:15 Well, there's that episode where she, she walks around the house topless and I was wondering
00:23:18 if you.
00:23:19 Topless.
00:23:20 Episode one.
00:23:21 Yeah.
00:23:22 I'm pretty sure that's episode one.
00:23:23 I was wondering if you were into that.
00:23:24 Um, I remember as a little kid finding it, you know, eyebrow raising like, oh, what's
00:23:28 going, what have we going on over here?
00:23:31 Yeah.
00:23:32 And I remember distinctly, she opens the door and Malcolm's teacher is there and she's
00:23:36 not wearing a shirt and she's like, the teacher's like, uh, no, no, no, she's like, they're
00:23:39 just boobs, lady.
00:23:40 And I'm sure yours are much nicer than mine.
00:23:42 I remember that.
00:23:43 I remember that very nice.
00:23:44 And she's like, no, no, I swear they're not.
00:23:45 They're really not.
00:23:46 I think, uh, well, I'm not that into like, uh, mother, son, but I am totally into moms.
00:23:55 Like in general, like, like, like in my porn, I'd prefer it be like if a guy is hooking
00:23:59 up with someone who is a mom, that's harder to me just because I don't know, there's
00:24:05 a fucking that kid.
00:24:07 There's something like, like, I like to feel the baby inside when I'm, you know, I didn't
00:24:11 say pregnant.
00:24:12 Well, I'm taking it to that place for some reason, whatever I see, whatever I see, like
00:24:20 mother, son stuff, I always have this like weird feeling like the mom is being irresponsible
00:24:25 somehow.
00:24:26 Oh yeah.
00:24:27 That turns me off a little bit for some reason, even though I like the daddy daughter stuff.
00:24:30 It's definitely a bad idea guys, to fuck your son.
00:24:33 Yeah.
00:24:34 Moms should definitely not have sex with their kids unless absolutely necessary.
00:24:37 Important PSA from Nate Bestman.
00:24:39 Yeah, that's right.
00:24:43 Unless absolutely necessary.
00:24:44 I definitely put that caveat in there.
00:24:45 That's important.
00:24:46 I shouldn't have to think what the reason for absolutely necessary would be.
00:24:52 Like if they've got a gun to my head, man, what can I do?
00:24:55 I did have a gun to your head question for you, Nate, but I think Digi wants to finish.
00:24:58 Yeah, I'm sorry.
00:24:59 Oh, no, I think I said, okay, Nate, incest question for you.
00:25:04 Okay.
00:25:05 Gun to your head.
00:25:06 You have to get a handjob from one of them.
00:25:08 Ben are your sister.
00:25:09 Well, obviously my sister.
00:25:11 So fuck off.
00:25:12 I'd get a handjob from Ben immediately.
00:25:15 I don't even need the gun.
00:25:18 Don't even need the gun.
00:25:19 I'm just looking for an excuse.
00:25:20 Nate, do you think your sister is hot?
00:25:25 Well, I don't want to be rude to her.
00:25:27 Yeah, she looks sort of like me so totally.
00:25:29 You know, I don't want to be, it's weird for me to even think of her in those terms.
00:25:33 She is a perfectly attractive young lady who I have deep respect for.
00:25:38 That's really the extent of it.
00:25:40 I feel like I know of a lot of stories of like siblings who do end up doing more sexual stuff
00:25:48 like if they're close in age when they're much younger, you know?
00:25:52 Sure, sure.
00:25:53 Me and Victor never did anything like weird together, but we did look at porn as kids
00:25:58 together.
00:25:59 Sure.
00:26:00 Like we would, and just like, I don't know, I sort of tried to teach him how to grind
00:26:04 his cock against the ground, which is what I was doing, but he didn't seem to get it.
00:26:09 But like, I definitely have known lots of sisters who've done stuff like that as kids,
00:26:13 you know?
00:26:14 Yeah.
00:26:15 Lena Dunham, my hero.
00:26:16 It doesn't count if your sister's a fucking baby.
00:26:20 Oh, I think it counts.
00:26:22 That's the thing.
00:26:24 I feel like incest, when you have close siblings and you're all going through that sort of
00:26:30 pubescent age together, it would almost be weirder for me to think of it never happening,
00:26:36 you know?
00:26:37 Like if you're like a year and a half apart from your sibling.
00:26:40 Or even twin-cessed.
00:26:42 Yeah, or even twins.
00:26:43 Sure, sure.
00:26:44 And you're like eight or nine.
00:26:45 I refuse to believe there's any twins who haven't fucked.
00:26:48 At that point, it's just masturbation.
00:26:51 Yeah, they've definitely done something together.
00:26:53 You can't be twins and not do anything.
00:26:56 Because you're experiencing it at the exact same time.
00:26:59 Your bodies are both changing.
00:27:01 Both of you are quizzical about it and you're extremely close with each other, so who else
00:27:05 are you going to share this with?
00:27:07 Yeah, that's the thing.
00:27:08 If you keep that in mind as you watch The Sweet Life of Zack and Cody, it really has a different
00:27:12 narrative that's forming before your eyes.
00:27:18 For me, a lot of my incestuous fantasies come from that age.
00:27:26 Discovering your body and being like, who can help me understand this?
00:27:31 Who is in the best position?
00:27:33 It's not a stranger.
00:27:35 And the schools don't teach you enough.
00:27:38 Society doesn't teach you enough.
00:27:40 You're just quizzical about your body.
00:27:42 Who's going to help you learn about it but your big brother?
00:27:47 Who's going to help this cute little girl figure out?
00:27:50 Who else but Lena Dunham is going to take this burden off?
00:27:53 Why is she so hot down there?
00:27:57 It's interesting.
00:27:58 I have a different approach to it.
00:28:00 I notice in the stories I gravitate to, it's more like the mom notices like, wow, you've
00:28:07 really become a man.
00:28:08 You've really become a man now with them.
00:28:11 That sort of angle.
00:28:12 I get that too.
00:28:13 That's interesting because we're looking at this from very different age ranges.
00:28:18 When I think I like little sisters and daughters, it's just like a lolly thing for me.
00:28:24 I'm picturing age 8 to 12 and you're probably picturing guys age 16 to 20 or something.
00:28:33 Yeah, something like that.
00:28:37 What turns me on about the little sister or the daughter is that they look up to you.
00:28:43 It's someone who's really close to you, who looks up to you, who thinks you're the coolest
00:28:47 person in the world and all they want is to be close and make you happy.
00:28:53 I'm with you and I feel you on that.
00:28:55 That particular idea sort of strikes me as sort of emotional manipulation.
00:29:01 You really shouldn't fuck your 8-year-old sister.
00:29:05 It's just more sage advice from Nate the Best.
00:29:09 It's not the best idea.
00:29:11 It's a fantasy.
00:29:12 That's fine.
00:29:14 I feel like I'm doing something bad which I don't find attractive.
00:29:18 Yeah, well, the best part about incest is that none of us would do it with our real siblings.
00:29:25 Right.
00:29:26 I don't know.
00:29:27 If Patchy came over and I was kind of drunk, a bro job.
00:29:31 What's going to happen?
00:29:33 A bro job.
00:29:34 What was the thing I was saying I wanted us to do?
00:29:37 Cock handshakes.
00:29:38 Yeah.
00:29:39 Cock handshakes.
00:29:40 Which someone then pointed out to me is just jacking each other up and I legit had not
00:29:45 put that together when I came over.
00:29:47 I was like, no, you just grab the cock and shake it like you're shaking a hand.
00:29:51 You're just masturbating them and I'm like, oh.
00:29:54 I always thought it was sort of like entwining the dicks together and then kind of gyrating
00:29:59 against each other.
00:30:00 That's how I was interpreting it.
00:30:01 No, I was just picturing everybody, like everybody standing in the circle, grabbing each other's
00:30:05 dicks and just giving it a firm handshake like once.
00:30:08 Just like, hello.
00:30:09 Just one pump.
00:30:10 Right.
00:30:11 Yeah.
00:30:12 Okay.
00:30:13 Okay.
00:30:14 Well, shit, I don't know.
00:30:15 Still on the table for Radcon 3.
00:30:17 Yeah.
00:30:18 We got plans.
00:30:19 We got plans.
00:30:20 It takes a lot of preparation.
00:30:21 It takes a lot of preparation.
00:30:22 So where do we go from here?
00:30:25 Hippo says you're leaking a first leaking.
00:30:28 That's correct.
00:30:30 He's correct.
00:30:31 First leaking.
00:30:34 We really covered the main stuff there.
00:30:36 I just wanted to talk about there's so many different varieties of incest.
00:30:41 I don't know.
00:30:42 You know, Mumpkin mentioned sort of like more distant family members things like cousin
00:30:46 fucking and stuff, which is actually kind of socially acceptable, you know, depending on
00:30:50 how far away they are.
00:30:51 Yeah.
00:30:52 I mean, that's how anime gets away with all of it, is that it's always a cousin.
00:30:56 Unless you're looking at, because that shit pisses me off because I feel like you're just
00:31:00 trying to get,
00:31:01 They're being fucking cowards.
00:31:02 Yeah.
00:31:03 Just commit.
00:31:04 Well, it's because they want, because the appeal, again, the appeal of the little sister
00:31:06 is that she looks up to you, she's been with you your whole life.
00:31:10 She, and she wants to ride the dick, right?
00:31:12 But then it's always like, oh, but she's not actually my sister.
00:31:16 It's really my cousin, but she still calls me Oni-chan because I'm like a brother to her.
00:31:21 And I'm like, you don't get to have it both ways.
00:31:24 To me, that's just cheap.
00:31:25 Did you got to help me with this real quick?
00:31:27 I've been wondering for a long time now.
00:31:28 Is it actually a thing they do where girls just call guys that they're really close with
00:31:33 Oni-chan?
00:31:34 Yeah.
00:31:35 How legit is that?
00:31:36 Anyone, any guy in the age range of a teenager to a young adult is an Oni-san.
00:31:42 Right.
00:31:43 Oni just means a male of that age.
00:31:46 Does that mean brother?
00:31:47 I thought specifically it was...
00:31:48 Well, Oni can also mean brother, yes, but it means both.
00:31:52 It's like Oji-san can mean uncle or it can mean a man in like the late 20s, early 30s, middle
00:32:00 age.
00:32:01 Oji-san is middle-aged man.
00:32:02 I said, oh, G-san is grandpa or old man.
00:32:05 Oh, Jesus Christ.
00:32:06 Okay.
00:32:07 Okay.
00:32:08 All right.
00:32:09 Speaking of which, what are our thoughts on grandparent incest?
00:32:12 Is that what you guys draw the line or is that...
00:32:15 You know...
00:32:16 Okay.
00:32:17 Grandma's are out.
00:32:18 Grandma's are out.
00:32:19 Grandma's are out.
00:32:21 There are some hot grandmas out there, but to me, a hot grand...
00:32:27 There's some people who are into grandmas, you know, like a fat, flabby, old woman.
00:32:35 Not interested.
00:32:36 If a grandma is still keeping it tight after all these years, that's hot.
00:32:39 Yeah, like Mumkey's grandma.
00:32:41 We can all fantasize about Mumkey's grandma.
00:32:44 Mumkey's grandma is more a standard grandma.
00:32:48 I always think of the grandma from Majlis Chopping Arcade of Inno Bashi.
00:32:52 You know that one?
00:32:53 You know her?
00:32:54 It's been way too long since I've seen her.
00:32:55 Yeah, whatever.
00:32:56 Yeah.
00:32:57 I'd fuck a grandma.
00:32:58 I'd fuck my own grandma.
00:32:59 That wasn't the question.
00:33:00 Uh-oh.
00:33:01 Oops.
00:33:02 What I was going to say is, well, grandmas are less on the table.
00:33:07 There's one porn.
00:33:08 I don't remember what the fuck it's called.
00:33:10 It's by this guy, Yosino, who does all this great 3D porn.
00:33:14 He's got one where it's these two super old grandpas fucking their super young granddaughters.
00:33:20 I've always got the sense from it that they're doing it out of respect.
00:33:25 Like, oh, these are the patriarchs of the family.
00:33:30 We want to please them because they're fucking old and they deserve it.
00:33:34 Oh, oh.
00:33:35 The girls are doing it out of respect.
00:33:36 Yeah, yeah.
00:33:37 Yeah, no.
00:33:38 The girls are like, oh, we respect our grandfather, so we're going to fuck them.
00:33:41 They seem to be enjoying it.
00:33:43 They're like, this is cool.
00:33:44 Isn't that typical of Japanese culture?
00:33:47 Yes.
00:33:48 That's why I've interpreted it that way.
00:33:50 Yeah.
00:33:51 I'm not entirely sure if that's what the actual plot is because I don't read.
00:33:54 Hey, man.
00:33:55 Cultural relativism.
00:33:56 What can I say?
00:33:57 It's all on the table.
00:33:58 It's all good.
00:33:59 It's all fine.
00:34:00 I can't criticize.
00:34:01 I need to look up what that's called.
00:34:02 I've got it on my computer.
00:34:03 But you guys can talk.
00:34:04 Well, I, yeah, I was going to say the whole, like, I like that sort of thing in my porn
00:34:10 kind of like you're kind of obligated to like fuck within the family sort of thing.
00:34:14 Like kind of like the Targaryen thing, you know, it's like, I don't know, isn't it kind
00:34:18 of sexy that like Daenerys was like raised with her brothers and she's like, and they're
00:34:22 like, yeah, you're going to fuck your brothers.
00:34:24 You're going to do this.
00:34:25 You got no choice.
00:34:26 It's pretty hot.
00:34:27 It's pretty hot.
00:34:28 I'm just saying.
00:34:29 What about Cersei and Jaime?
00:34:30 Like that's, they're like a perfect.
00:34:32 They're the opposite though.
00:34:34 I really like their incest because of the fact that they are grown adults and they've
00:34:39 like had the kids and everything of the incest and they're still like completely in love
00:34:44 with each other.
00:34:45 Like it's really interesting to me because usually you see it as like when they're younger
00:34:50 and then you kind of assume that eventually, I don't know, they stop when she marries the
00:34:54 king or something, but no, they're still fucking doing it like in their 40s.
00:34:59 That's pretty cool.
00:35:00 I agree.
00:35:01 And I can't believe I didn't even think of this until right now, but, uh, or a emo or
00:35:08 a fucking emo.
00:35:09 Oh, Mago Zen Pen is the name of that old man fucking.
00:35:13 If anybody was really, really needed that.
00:35:15 Yeah.
00:35:16 I'm looking at it.
00:35:17 Can you send me a link after this podcast?
00:35:19 Uh, no, I've got it downloaded.
00:35:21 So just look up.
00:35:22 Let me just tell you, let me just tell you my general feelings about or emo.
00:35:26 Okay.
00:35:27 So or emo is this fascinating story about a boy who wants to fuck his sister and she's
00:35:33 dumb.
00:35:34 I think she wants to fuck him too.
00:35:36 And like she slow, like he slowly through this doesn't even start to describe the plot
00:35:41 of or emo.
00:35:42 It's close enough.
00:35:43 It's the things that matter.
00:35:44 Neither one of them wanted to fuck each other at the start of the series at all.
00:35:48 They, it was a subtext.
00:35:50 Okay.
00:35:51 But the point is they get to that place and like they develop all these friendships over
00:35:54 the course of the series and then slowly, but surely this is like or emo is where like
00:35:59 incest is at its worst really in like fiction stuff.
00:36:02 It's like what happens is that he's built up all these friends, he's made all these
00:36:06 connections like in the first part of the show when like it wasn't just about the two
00:36:10 of them fucking, you know, they just, whatever they develop relationships with lots of these
00:36:14 people and they just live life and do good stuff and all these other women come into
00:36:18 the guy's life that he could choose from and slowly, but surely in the second half of the
00:36:21 show, he just one by one kills off all those other girls and is eventually just left with
00:36:27 Kirino.
00:36:28 He has sacrificed everything else in his life, all these other relationships for this incestuous
00:36:32 relationship that's going to be a huge problem with a 15 year old girl that is obviously
00:36:36 not going to last and like it just ends with like they kiss and then they break up.
00:36:40 And it's so like, when I look at that, it's just like this guy threw away all this potential
00:36:45 good shit in his life for this relationship that he also threw right in the trash and
00:36:50 that he should have known from the start like wasn't going to go anywhere.
00:36:53 I thought they got married or some shit.
00:36:56 They, I mean it's like different in the manga or like the novels versus the anime or something
00:37:00 like in the anime, which is the thing that I watch, which, which made me want to die.
00:37:03 They just kiss and then they're like, okay, we're done.
00:37:06 Okay, we're done.
00:37:07 And there's some subjects like, ooh, maybe they'll keep dating in secret or something.
00:37:09 Or like, why?
00:37:10 What the fuck is that about?
00:37:11 Orimo is the dumbest way to do because, okay, the, have you seen Genchi Ken, any of you
00:37:19 at all?
00:37:20 Yeah, I've seen the whole thing.
00:37:21 Yeah.
00:37:22 So you remember that early on, there's like a discussion about incest where, cause Madarame,
00:37:27 the character who is my, my, my boy is a big, big into little sisters and lollies and shit.
00:37:33 And uh, Sasahara, the main character guy, he is not into little girls at all.
00:37:37 He's all into big, beautiful bitches and big, big, big boy.
00:37:41 He's my boy.
00:37:42 Yeah.
00:37:43 Hippo kind of guy.
00:37:44 Yeah.
00:37:45 Yeah.
00:37:46 He's a big titty boy.
00:37:47 And the reason for that is that he has a younger sister who's like a gen guru who he fights
00:37:48 with all the time.
00:37:50 And so he sees it as like younger sisters are completely disgusting.
00:37:53 Like he's not even slightly interested because he has this contentious relationship with
00:37:57 his.
00:37:58 And um, my friend, Don-san, who is the one who like got me into like deeper, deeper Otaku
00:38:05 shit, you know, he was very much the same.
00:38:08 He had a little sister.
00:38:09 He argued with her all the time.
00:38:10 He thought little sisters were totally out of the picture.
00:38:13 And the funny thing about it is that the way Kirino's relationship with her brothers portrayed
00:38:18 early in the show is exactly that kind of relationship.
00:38:23 Like they're at each other's throats.
00:38:24 They don't like each other.
00:38:26 Like it felt very realistic.
00:38:29 And then the show somehow bends over backwards and pretzels itself to make them end up together.
00:38:35 That's the whole problem right there.
00:38:38 It's just the most earth shattering like reversal of like an actually good idea that just fucking
00:38:43 makes me want to die.
00:38:44 It's nuts.
00:38:45 It's fucking insane.
00:38:47 And like it's weird because like if that's what the dude wanted to do all along, like
00:38:51 why did he take this like weird circuitous path that was actually made sense and was
00:38:54 like the total opposite of the, I don't know, it just, it baffles me to this fucking day.
00:38:58 Anyway, now that you've derailed us with Oriibo for it.
00:39:03 It's relevant.
00:39:04 It's relevant.
00:39:05 It's the most interesting thing that happened in an incest related thing to anime.
00:39:08 It's probably the most famous incest anime that's out there other than maybe Kiss Ex-Sys,
00:39:14 which I don't think those are his real sisters in that show.
00:39:17 Yeah, I think you're right.
00:39:18 Have any of you guys seen the shitty Adam Sandler movie?
00:39:21 That's my boy.
00:39:22 No.
00:39:23 No, I have not.
00:39:24 It was the first time and I've, I've never been into Game of Thrones or any of that.
00:39:28 So it was the first time I'd seen incest propelled in the mainstream, at least in the US.
00:39:34 The plot of the movie is Andy Sandberg is the son of Adam Sandler and that he's getting
00:39:38 married and then Adam Sandler finds out that the fiance is fucking her brother and it was
00:39:43 played as a joke and I thought it was funny.
00:39:46 And I was the only person laughing in the theater at the big reveal and everybody around
00:39:50 me was like this, this awkward really like they're in awe and disgust and they're kind
00:39:58 of horrified by the film and that was the first time that I realized, oh maybe the mainstream
00:40:03 people are more horrified of this than I think because I thought this was funny for a shitty
00:40:08 Adam Sandler movie.
00:40:09 I think this podcast right here is probably the most positive that four people have been
00:40:15 about incest publicly ever in history.
00:40:18 It's quite possible.
00:40:20 Like even the guy who has no incest fetishes is like, yeah man, stay out of people's bedrooms.
00:40:27 Like granted, Tom is also the guy who wrote the, what's it called, Tom?
00:40:33 How do you want to describe it before I have to describe it?
00:40:36 How do you want to salvage the description of your, your, your Pony fanfic about underaged
00:40:44 or sex?
00:40:45 No way to salvage it.
00:40:47 Is this not the tricksy one?
00:40:48 Is this something else?
00:40:49 No, the one he wrote about Scootaloo having sex with a like 30 year old guy.
00:40:55 That sounds great.
00:40:56 I don't remember it, but that sounds awesome.
00:40:57 And it's good.
00:40:58 It was, it was a full novel.
00:40:59 It was, it was recede to why to claim, which disgusted me to this day.
00:41:03 I had no idea.
00:41:04 What?
00:41:05 But you wrote a full length Pony novel.
00:41:07 He wrote the full length Pony fan fiction.
00:41:10 2013.
00:41:11 Novel.
00:41:12 It's horrible.
00:41:13 Holy shit.
00:41:14 How did you not know that?
00:41:15 Looking up with an older man.
00:41:16 I don't know.
00:41:17 I guess maybe I just got confused.
00:41:18 And whenever like it came up, I just kept thinking it was like the tricksy comic for
00:41:21 some reason.
00:41:22 And I always thought, I always thought you were saying like you'd never written a book, but
00:41:25 here you go.
00:41:26 Here's your breakout hit, dude.
00:41:27 That doesn't count as a book.
00:41:28 That's not real.
00:41:29 It's not a real book.
00:41:30 Is the old man a human or a Pony?
00:41:32 It's still there.
00:41:33 It's all, it's all horse, gay shit.
00:41:34 Okay.
00:41:35 Good.
00:41:36 But um, no.
00:41:37 Um, but the older guy is also like borderline ex-be for Tom himself.
00:41:41 So what was that guy's cutie?
00:41:43 Everyone said that.
00:41:44 It wasn't even the point.
00:41:45 Yeah.
00:41:46 But he did come off as, maybe just because it's written from his perspective.
00:41:49 So it sounds like you.
00:41:50 Yeah.
00:41:51 Yeah.
00:41:52 Sounds like he was groaning curious for sure.
00:41:53 Yeah.
00:41:54 Yeah.
00:41:55 That's true.
00:41:56 That's, that's what.
00:41:57 I thought it was.
00:41:58 I didn't read the whole thing.
00:41:59 I thought it was good.
00:42:00 Well.
00:42:01 Yeah.
00:42:02 I don't know.
00:42:03 What was your, even your question?
00:42:04 Just.
00:42:05 I was just pointing out.
00:42:06 What does it have to do with what we were talking about?
00:42:07 I was just pointing out that you, that, that while you are not an incest family, you
00:42:11 are not an incest fetishist.
00:42:14 I cannot pretend as though you're like the normie here who also is okay with that.
00:42:18 Oh right.
00:42:19 I did it.
00:42:20 No.
00:42:21 Clearly no.
00:42:22 Sure.
00:42:23 Everybody go read that fanfare.
00:42:24 I don't remember what it's called.
00:42:25 Post a link in the description, Ben.
00:42:27 I know you're going to listen through it when you edit this.
00:42:30 Of course.
00:42:31 Ben, Ben can dig it up.
00:42:32 Hey, if we have, if we're not, you know, super into incest, we can just do 30 minutes
00:42:36 of questions.
00:42:37 Yeah.
00:42:38 I was just thinking, maybe let's just switch over to that.
00:42:40 I actually say more about incest.
00:42:43 If you got it, if you got a thing you want to say, yeah, go for it.
00:42:45 I don't know how deep I want to get into it, but because like, because yeah, you guys
00:42:50 talked about it as like a fetish.
00:42:52 I had never thought of incest as a fetish.
00:42:55 Like it was more just a tag.
00:42:57 Like it's not something I sought out.
00:42:59 I like it, especially like, again, like a older brother, younger sister stuff, but more
00:43:05 because like I mostly encountered it so much because I like lollies in general.
00:43:10 So I would come across a lot of that, you know, it wasn't so much that I was seeking
00:43:13 it out.
00:43:16 And so like, I wouldn't have said I had like a fetish for it until recently.
00:43:22 And that's because it turns out that while your girlfriend looks exactly like she'd be
00:43:26 your sister, that is, well, that too, and, and she's like way into that idea.
00:43:33 You know, my little sister's name is Grace and Ben's first girlfriend was a girl named
00:43:37 Grace.
00:43:38 I'm just saying.
00:43:40 But, but it's funny you say that because they were the dick show I was listening to just
00:43:45 before like earlier today was about how he was saying like, I couldn't fuck a girl who
00:43:49 had the same name as my sister.
00:43:51 I, Ben's got no problem with that.
00:43:52 I agree.
00:43:53 I agree with that statement.
00:43:54 I don't think I could do it.
00:43:55 That'd be really weird.
00:43:56 If I met a girl named Patchy, it would just make me harder.
00:43:59 But anyways, my perception of incest as a fetish has changed dramatically upon the realization
00:44:06 that you can role play that fetish.
00:44:08 Like all you have to do is just pretend like, okay, you are my sister and it's like you're
00:44:14 fucking your eight year old younger sister just because you say that you are.
00:44:20 And so you can have to put the age in there.
00:44:21 Could it just.
00:44:22 Yes.
00:44:23 No, I had to.
00:44:24 It likes the little age.
00:44:25 It's got to be fine.
00:44:26 She's got to be a little girl or else it's not who am I to judge.
00:44:30 I shouldn't butt in because if she's her real age, she's just my wife, you know, like
00:44:36 that's right.
00:44:38 Still be your sister.
00:44:40 It's not.
00:44:41 You got to compartmentalize.
00:44:42 All sisters aren't eight.
00:44:44 It's.
00:44:45 We can't question.
00:44:46 Yes, they aren't.
00:44:47 They are.
00:44:48 They are.
00:44:49 They are.
00:44:50 They are.
00:44:51 It's eights.
00:44:52 Eights when they develop sexually.
00:44:53 They don't develop.
00:44:54 Shit.
00:44:55 They are age eight.
00:44:56 Yeah.
00:44:57 Girls start developing at eight.
00:44:58 No fucking way.
00:44:59 I do.
00:45:00 There were girls in my fucking class in third grade who had tits, like real tits.
00:45:04 Like they started eight.
00:45:05 Girls start way younger than guys.
00:45:06 At eight?
00:45:07 Girls start around 10.
00:45:08 Girls start around eight.
00:45:09 They get their periods at like age 10.
00:45:12 First of all, you can start getting wet before you get your period.
00:45:15 So you probably.
00:45:16 Okay.
00:45:17 The more you know.
00:45:18 I've interviewed a lot of girls about their sex lives.
00:45:21 Yeah.
00:45:22 Keep going.
00:45:23 I'm learning things I need to know about.
00:45:25 This is good.
00:45:26 This is interesting.
00:45:27 No.
00:45:28 There was a period where I was trying to write novels and all the characters I wrote were
00:45:32 young girls.
00:45:33 So I interviewed a bunch of women about what it's like to be a young girl when you start
00:45:36 developing different sexual feelings.
00:45:38 Pretty consistent.
00:45:39 Like a fucking mom?
00:45:40 Who'd you ask?
00:45:41 No.
00:45:42 Like people online.
00:45:43 Like women I knew in the anime blogging sphere.
00:45:46 And you know, both girlfriends I've had.
00:45:48 So the answer I always get is eight.
00:45:51 Eight is about when you start thinking about sexual stuff.
00:45:56 And then.
00:45:57 Are we here on the PCB going to officially say the age of consent should be eight years
00:46:00 old?
00:46:01 No.
00:46:02 No.
00:46:03 No.
00:46:04 No.
00:46:05 No.
00:46:06 No.
00:46:07 All right.
00:46:08 Mexico's got it right.
00:46:09 I put it like 15, 13, something around there.
00:46:11 The way my fantasy usually goes is you start at eight is when the interest develops.
00:46:18 But it's not until a few years later that you actually go all the way once their body
00:46:23 is ready.
00:46:24 That's when your dad takes you into the back room and he starts to explain to you and he
00:46:26 starts to feel you and show you how it works.
00:46:28 Right.
00:46:29 Exactly.
00:46:30 Okay.
00:46:31 Understood.
00:46:32 Understood.
00:46:33 He knows what's up.
00:46:34 Yeah.
00:46:35 He knows his way around.
00:46:36 Which I do want to say, Digi, that something was just uploaded to YouTube that I think
00:46:41 might be the perfect example of the worst video that you could ever possibly see.
00:46:46 Do you know how you and your girlfriend have been doing that series of reviewing every
00:46:51 Pokemon and looking at the pictures and stuff?
00:46:55 Well, what didn't you know?
00:46:57 Our good friend of the show, future PCP member Psy, just uploaded his own version co-hosted
00:47:03 by Asperger and it's two hours of them reviewing just the first 60 Pokemon, so they're taking
00:47:09 their sweet time.
00:47:10 Yeah, I guess so.
00:47:11 They need to move it along, guys.
00:47:13 I think Digi would get a lot from watching that video.
00:47:16 It's two favorite people copying his idea and doing it twice as long.
00:47:21 Are they just like, why would I want that?
00:47:24 I'm confused.
00:47:25 I'm confused.
00:47:26 Context.
00:47:27 What is the relevance?
00:47:28 What is the relevance to our topic here?
00:47:30 I don't understand.
00:47:31 Are you just trying to shout out that video?
00:47:32 Is that your point?
00:47:33 No, because I was thinking about how him and his girlfriend do that series and then this
00:47:37 just popped up in my sub feed.
00:47:39 I haven't actually watched it.
00:47:42 Two hours.
00:47:43 Well, they need to hurry their fucking asses up.
00:47:44 They should have covered every Pokemon in two hours.
00:47:47 Yeah.
00:47:48 I was just saying, I thought that would be like the ultimate video to piss off Digi,
00:47:52 but I guess I was mistaken.
00:47:54 It's hard to piss off Digi.
00:47:57 Anyway, we want to move to questions now.
00:48:00 Are we done?
00:48:01 Let's do it.
00:48:02 I got nothing else to say.
00:48:03 I don't want to go any deeper.
00:48:04 Hashtag legalize it.
00:48:05 Hashtag, you know, let me fuck my mom.
00:48:08 Yeah.
00:48:09 You know, just all the hashtags, you know, legalize it.
00:48:13 Give a check off to your mom.
00:48:15 At all.
00:48:16 I can safely say no.
00:48:17 I can safely say no.
00:48:18 Monkey.
00:48:19 Not even tempted.
00:48:20 No, never.
00:48:21 Tom.
00:48:22 Never.
00:48:23 Okay.
00:48:24 Here's the thing.
00:48:25 I'm just going to say that at some points in my life, I have acknowledged that my sister
00:48:30 is a girl.
00:48:31 I have been aware of that fact.
00:48:33 If you if you understand what I'm saying, I'm not saying that.
00:48:36 No, no.
00:48:37 I'm not saying that.
00:48:38 I'm not saying that when I was like, when I was particularly like depressed, lonely,
00:48:46 learning about sex, 12 years old, I jacked off to like every woman in my family.
00:48:50 I think every woman I've ever come into contact with, I've like probably jacked off thinking
00:48:56 about at least briefly, usually followed by immense guilt and realizing it wasn't a good
00:49:00 idea.
00:49:01 But yeah, I was going to say like to me, it's weird.
00:49:04 I felt weird sometimes.
00:49:05 Like I didn't do that.
00:49:06 But like I would like into my mind, I would force myself to just concentrate on like one
00:49:10 of my classmates, like one specific one and be like, yeah, now I fuck this person in my
00:49:14 brain.
00:49:15 Same fucking sick.
00:49:16 Actually, before we move on from incest, I want to take you all to the darkest side
00:49:20 of incest, the worst element of it that I hate that has affected me in a very in a way
00:49:27 that makes me sick and want to cry.
00:49:30 Have you ever had incest dreams?
00:49:32 No, anybody.
00:49:34 Yeah, I think I have.
00:49:36 I think I have actually.
00:49:37 Yeah.
00:49:38 How did that go?
00:49:39 I'm pretty sure I fucked my sister in my dream.
00:49:40 I believe I did do that one time.
00:49:41 Tom, you ever had incest dreams?
00:49:43 Yeah.
00:49:44 I've never had incest dreams.
00:49:45 So I've had dreams.
00:49:46 But again, I rarely remember my dreams.
00:49:47 So who the fuck knows?
00:49:48 That's true.
00:49:49 I've had dreams.
00:49:50 That's a terrifying thought.
00:49:51 Thank you for planting that into my brain.
00:49:54 I've had incest dreams and they are horrifying and they always wake me wake me wake up like
00:49:58 feeling like I want to throw up everywhere.
00:50:00 And it's like the worst experience of my life is incest dreams.
00:50:04 It's the worst part.
00:50:05 It's when you have to go clean up your underwear afterwards.
00:50:07 No, none of them are none of them are the sexy kind.
00:50:10 They're all like horrible.
00:50:11 All my dreams are nightmares.
00:50:12 Oh, really?
00:50:13 Like every dream I have is a nightmare.
00:50:15 So my incest dreams are all like terrifying and bad.
00:50:18 And I legit wake up like feeling like I actually am going to throw up like.
00:50:23 Well, hey, why is are you like in a sex dungeon being like raped or something?
00:50:27 What's what's so bad about it?
00:50:28 There was one where I raped one of them.
00:50:30 Okay.
00:50:31 That was horrifying.
00:50:32 I also dream about raping Victor, but I don't have the same reaction you do.
00:50:36 Yeah.
00:50:37 All right, let's move on to questions.
00:50:40 Can we all agree that if we could, we would fuck Victor?
00:50:45 I think we can agree with that.
00:50:47 Let me let me get it.
00:50:48 I'll be the questions boy today since I asked on the we're taking them from the PCP Patreon
00:50:55 chat.
00:50:56 If you didn't know.
00:50:57 What's the how much that the pay to get into the Patreon chat?
00:51:00 Just $1.
00:51:01 Just $1.
00:51:02 If you're a patron at all, you get into our exclusive patron discord.
00:51:07 It's the only place that discusses this show that is not cancer.
00:51:11 So true.
00:51:12 The comment section on YouTube, utter cancer, disgusting, deplorable cancer, the PCP fan
00:51:17 discord that I run discord cancer that existed before this absolute cancer.
00:51:23 Do not go there.
00:51:24 You will want to kill yourself.
00:51:25 Yeah.
00:51:26 The one that gives us money conveniently is great.
00:51:30 Yeah.
00:51:31 Because of paywall, man.
00:51:32 It's only paywall.
00:51:33 People give money.
00:51:34 It's true.
00:51:35 All right.
00:51:36 From tadpo.
00:51:37 He asks, how do you deal with backlogs after long stays away from the internet?
00:51:41 This is something I have a lot of trouble with.
00:51:42 I don't know about you guys.
00:51:44 You know, I like after like a weekend or something being away, just to look at my YouTube and
00:51:49 see like all the videos that have piled up, I don't know, nothing fancy.
00:51:53 I guess I really just try to just break it down and just ease into it one thing at a
00:51:57 time.
00:51:58 I'm pretty organized in the way I approach the stuff.
00:52:00 It's probably categorized it.
00:52:01 Or if there's like a show that I've missed, I just try to get all the episodes so I have
00:52:04 them at my fingertips and then I'll watch them when I need to.
00:52:08 I ended up leaving just a lot of shit unwatched.
00:52:10 Like it's I can't like it because they're still coming out.
00:52:15 You know, like I follow enough channels to keep me busy throughout the day.
00:52:18 So if I stack up a week of missed videos and then that day, there's also a bunch of
00:52:23 new videos coming out.
00:52:24 It's like, oh, this is never going to happen.
00:52:27 Sometimes I'll go through and I'll just cull the stuff that I'm like, okay, you know, I
00:52:30 don't actually need to watch like the new best of the worst, for example, or something
00:52:34 like that.
00:52:35 Yeah, I usually skip best of the worst, but I won't skip half in the bag.
00:52:37 But that's because it's easier to throw on in the background.
00:52:40 And like ironically, the stuff, the stuff I watch the most on YouTube is the shit I don't
00:52:44 have to pay attention to because I can just leave it running continuously.
00:52:48 The stuff that I actually have to concentrate on, I often end up getting to like way later
00:52:52 or I miss everything or I'll have a day where like, for instance, with hippo, he was doing
00:52:57 his imgavu a tuatij right when I was traveling the country and a lot of those videos were
00:53:03 longer and stuff.
00:53:04 And I felt like I had to watch them.
00:53:05 So I had like a whole weekend of just like all I did was watch hippo videos until I was
00:53:11 caught up, you know.
00:53:12 But a weekend.
00:53:13 Yeah.
00:53:14 Moving on to another question.
00:53:17 That never happens to me because I am never away from the internet.
00:53:22 And also most of the people I follow, like Nate, never uploads.
00:53:25 So it's fine.
00:53:26 Hey, man, Weagua is real.
00:53:28 I uploaded last night at 5 a.m. for you.
00:53:31 Yeah, me and Sheep overwatched it this morning.
00:53:33 And we...
00:53:34 Which make it 10 out of 10?
00:53:36 It was...
00:53:37 Let me say the best part of waking up is not folders in your cup.
00:53:40 It's Nate on your screen.
00:53:41 Oh, there you go.
00:53:42 And I love what you're doing with your Hillary Clinton fucking cut out.
00:53:46 It's great.
00:53:47 Oh, I've got big plans.
00:53:48 We've got big plans.
00:53:49 It's far away.
00:53:50 Yeah.
00:53:51 Monkey, here's a question I'm actually interested in hearing your answer in because you know
00:53:54 movies and actors a little better than the rest of us.
00:53:57 Cucked by the laws of aerodynamics asks, which actor would you have playing you in a PCP
00:54:03 movie?
00:54:04 Ooh.
00:54:05 Ooh, that's a good one.
00:54:06 Yeah.
00:54:07 We should cast the whole movie, all 10 of us.
00:54:09 Can we get John Goodman to play Gibb?
00:54:11 I just think that makes sense.
00:54:16 He's, you know, he's not even British.
00:54:19 Oh, no.
00:54:20 We use CGI and we shrink him digitally on the screen.
00:54:24 It's perfect.
00:54:25 That's perfect.
00:54:26 And lipo suction him on the screen too while we're at it.
00:54:28 I mean, do the actors have to be close to our age because I've heard that I look like
00:54:32 Martin Freeman and I would like to be portrayed by him, but more likely it would be like Elijah
00:54:36 Wood.
00:54:37 Elijah Wood's like 40 now, man.
00:54:40 Yeah, but he looks like he's fucking 15.
00:54:41 Yeah, he does.
00:54:44 Do you like Elijah Wood?
00:54:45 Would you have him play you?
00:54:46 Yeah.
00:54:47 He can play him.
00:54:48 I'm down with him.
00:54:49 I don't know if, I don't know if he like is temperamentally similar to you.
00:54:54 He did one movie where he plays like this creepy kind of serial killer guy.
00:54:58 So I think he can get into the demented state of Monkey Jones.
00:55:01 Actually, so I think Michael Sarah should play Davoo for sure.
00:55:05 Oh, yeah.
00:55:06 That's a weirdly good.
00:55:07 That's right.
00:55:08 He does look in like a weird way.
00:55:11 In a weird way.
00:55:14 Yeah.
00:55:15 Why does that work?
00:55:16 That shouldn't work at all.
00:55:18 It's the hair.
00:55:19 It's really the hair.
00:55:20 Yeah, I guess so.
00:55:21 Tom, do you know who you would have play you in a movie?
00:55:24 I don't know actors.
00:55:25 I don't pay attention to like popular culture.
00:55:28 I would just say Christian Bill because according to 4chan, I'm a Mexican Christian.
00:55:36 I can see that.
00:55:37 I can see you being perfect, especially like from the machinist.
00:55:40 I like how we're all picking guys like way more handsome than us.
00:55:44 All actors are good.
00:55:45 That's what movies are about, man.
00:55:47 Nate, you have an actor you'd pick.
00:55:49 Without a doubt.
00:55:50 It'd be Tom Cruise.
00:55:51 It'd be modern Tom Cruise would play me.
00:55:53 He's the only man strong enough with enough mental fortitude to handle the lifestyle of
00:55:57 the best guy ever.
00:55:58 I feel like you're more jacked than Tom Cruise.
00:56:01 Oh, no, man.
00:56:02 No.
00:56:03 Is he like Jack?
00:56:04 I'm working on it.
00:56:05 But he's a little short.
00:56:06 He's a little short.
00:56:07 Fuck.
00:56:08 I mean, like I'm probably the same height as him, actually.
00:56:09 But like for Hollywood, he's short.
00:56:10 I thought he was a really short.
00:56:11 He's a shit boy.
00:56:12 I mean, have you seen?
00:56:13 I mean, like Ellen Page to play mage.
00:56:16 I think Ellen Page is mage.
00:56:18 Is it mage like twice the height of Ellen Page?
00:56:20 Ellen Page is tight.
00:56:21 That is true.
00:56:22 That is true.
00:56:23 John Goodman's playing hippo.
00:56:24 Who fucking cares?
00:56:25 Digitally shrunk John Goodman.
00:56:27 I just want the poacher to say, Page is mage.
00:56:31 It sells itself.
00:56:33 I feel like the only answer I can come up with is Jack Black.
00:56:36 It just seems obvious to me.
00:56:38 Yeah.
00:56:39 Not bad.
00:56:40 I don't know who else it could possibly be.
00:56:42 So it's got to be Jack Black.
00:56:44 I don't like it.
00:56:45 It's going to be a very interesting performance.
00:56:46 Unless you wanted to look local to play Jess.
00:56:48 A lot of people say I look like that dude from Always Sunny, whichever one.
00:56:53 Fat Mac?
00:56:54 Probably Fat Mac.
00:56:55 I forget.
00:56:56 Fat Mac.
00:56:57 Okay.
00:56:58 Okay.
00:56:59 So I guess-
00:57:00 Who's a really like big buff, tough wrestler these days to play Jess?
00:57:03 Fucking Batista.
00:57:04 Oh, what's that guy?
00:57:05 Glorious.
00:57:06 Batista should play Jess.
00:57:07 Yeah, okay.
00:57:08 Batista.
00:57:09 Guardians, right?
00:57:10 But Batista, as he is in Guardians 2, should play Jess.
00:57:14 Like literally, it should just be Drax the Destroyer, like in the paint and everything.
00:57:20 It should play Jess.
00:57:23 Just with a wig on.
00:57:25 You have never seen anybody enjoy a character more than me and Jess enjoy Batista in that
00:57:30 movie.
00:57:31 Like, he's the greatest.
00:57:32 Hey, what's the guy who played, what's the guy who was an anti-Christ?
00:57:36 Willem Defoe should play Ben.
00:57:37 Willem Defoe should play Ben.
00:57:38 Yeah, totally.
00:57:39 That little goblin face going on, that's perfect.
00:57:42 Wait, who do we got from Munchie?
00:57:44 That's the last one.
00:57:45 Oh, Munchie should be played by God.
00:57:48 We'll see if he can fit it in his schedule.
00:57:53 We should get an actual gigantic baby boy to play Munchie.
00:57:56 Yeah, baby boy!
00:57:57 I think Munchie should just play himself.
00:58:00 Who else can be Munchie?
00:58:01 I think that's a good idea.
00:58:02 He's got time.
00:58:03 He can be in the movie.
00:58:04 Okay.
00:58:05 Is that everybody?
00:58:06 Do we miss-
00:58:07 Similar question from Orca.
00:58:10 If any person, fictional or non-fictional, had to join the PCP, who would you want on?
00:58:18 Who's just like an insufferable, intellectual, pseudo-intellectual asshole like Socrates?
00:58:22 If we're going non-fictional, I want Max Landis on this show.
00:58:26 Oh, man.
00:58:27 Yeah, he'd be good.
00:58:28 He's a perfect fit.
00:58:29 He'd be good.
00:58:30 We would never get a word in.
00:58:32 I would.
00:58:33 That's true.
00:58:34 It would just be me and him and Nate.
00:58:36 Yeah, I'm sure that's true.
00:58:37 And the podcast, we have to start our own splinter podcast so we actually say something.
00:58:43 That's inevitable anyway.
00:58:44 I don't know about fictional characters.
00:58:46 I want to get Donald Trump on the podcast.
00:58:48 Tyrion Lannister.
00:58:50 He'd be a good podcaster.
00:58:53 Trump would suck dick.
00:58:54 Trump would just fucking-
00:58:55 No, it'd be funny.
00:58:56 Trump's really funny.
00:58:57 Okay, Trump would be funny.
00:58:58 That's true.
00:58:59 That's true.
00:59:00 But he'd fail at making his points coherently.
00:59:01 He'd talk in circles.
00:59:02 He's a natural comedian, a natural showman.
00:59:04 If you watch anything that's not political, he's really funny.
00:59:07 Yeah, that's true.
00:59:08 That's true.
00:59:09 Nate, considering how dedicated you are to Pokemon going to the polls, you have a moral
00:59:13 obligation to get Donald Trump on here and give him what for.
00:59:17 You're right.
00:59:18 Oh, I thought you were going to say Hillary, to have Hillary join the PCP, which is not
00:59:21 a bad idea.
00:59:22 Yeah, she's got those great jokes that would fit right in.
00:59:26 She's full of them, dude.
00:59:29 All right.
00:59:30 Here's-
00:59:31 Uh-huh.
00:59:32 Is that everybody?
00:59:33 I was actually going to read this-
00:59:34 I did ask questions on Twitter.
00:59:35 There was just one that I wanted to address, just because it was sort of a logistical thing.
00:59:38 It was at Fat Man Falling.
00:59:40 Just asks, when are you releasing this month's bonus episode?
00:59:43 And I just thought I'd tell everybody.
00:59:44 We generally release those just on the first of the month, like every week, every month.
00:59:47 So yeah, that's it.
00:59:48 That's it.
00:59:49 Okay.
00:59:50 So in like three days from now?
00:59:51 No.
00:59:52 Like, oh, when this comes out?
00:59:53 Yeah.
00:59:54 It'll be like three days after this comes out.
00:59:55 That's true.
00:59:56 All right.
00:59:57 So he asks, best and worst ways you've ever spent a shitload of money relative to whatever
01:00:02 you think a shitload is?
01:00:05 I know exactly what it is, but I've already told this story before, so stop me if I've
01:00:08 told this.
01:00:09 But like, one day, when I was young and I was really into Vampire Hunter D, and I bought
01:00:12 this $100 leather hat, you know, I already told this-
01:00:15 Is that the best or worst way you spent a shitload of money?
01:00:18 It's worse than both at the same time.
01:00:20 Well, kind of, but like, it's the worst because like, I never once actually wore it and immediately
01:00:24 regretted spending $100 on it.
01:00:26 I was just like a whim thing, but for me at that age, $100 was so much fucking money.
01:00:30 It still is for me.
01:00:31 It was a complete terrible idea.
01:00:33 I mean, yeah, it's a lot in general.
01:00:36 Monkey time.
01:00:37 Once every other month, when I finally hit the $100 thing for YouTube Ad Revenue, that's
01:00:41 a big deal, my friend.
01:00:44 I finally did it for you money for doing that thing.
01:00:47 You make more than $100 a month.
01:00:48 Well, only because of me and Digi's podcast, but then I just give him half anyway, so.
01:00:52 Really?
01:00:53 Is that true?
01:00:54 Yeah.
01:00:55 Do you know how many of those are demonetized?
01:00:58 Oh, no.
01:00:59 That's a good point.
01:01:00 Are they monetized because I used some song for like 10 seconds?
01:01:05 Well, yeah.
01:01:06 That's true.
01:01:07 But it's fine.
01:01:08 The worst way I've spent a shitload of money relative to what was a shitload at the time
01:01:13 is buying two different $130 Kanan figures for the anime series Kanan, which I'm scared
01:01:22 to even re-watch, but I've got like $300 in toys for it.
01:01:26 So just because you're afraid you've wasted your money on these fucking figures, you can't
01:01:29 watch the show again.
01:01:30 Yeah, the figures are broken now, so like it's a total wash.
01:01:34 Really all my figures, I have some level of regret for, all the expensive ones.
01:01:40 Just because they're so expensive.
01:01:42 But the best way I spent a shitload of money was buying several hotel trips in Rochester,
01:01:49 New York two, three months ago, $600 a week, but totally worth it.
01:01:55 People are, you know, I hear people say things like, what are you doing paying money to,
01:01:59 you know, for like, why don't you buy local pussy, dude, what are you doing, flying people
01:02:03 around and stuff, you know, as I'm arguing.
01:02:07 If the pussy that good, then it would work.
01:02:10 That's right.
01:02:11 That's right.
01:02:12 I mean, last, I would say, if I had to pick another one, it would like another worse one,
01:02:16 it would be the second trip to my ex-girlfriend.
01:02:19 Sure.
01:02:20 The first one was worth it because it was $400 and I lost my virginity and that was nice.
01:02:26 The second trip, not worth it at all.
01:02:28 Should have broke up before that.
01:02:30 Understandable.
01:02:31 So, yeah.
01:02:32 Yeah, I know what you mean.
01:02:33 Probably spent even more on that trip.
01:02:35 By the way, that just, your figure story reminds me about how I've been wanting, I've had like
01:02:38 a fantasy of buying like the perfect commune of figure for years and like they, there have
01:02:43 been a bunch that come out that are pretty nice.
01:02:45 And I'm always thinking like, yeah, it's one day I'll buy that.
01:02:48 I don't know why I just don't.
01:02:49 I just want to own it and build a little shrine to it.
01:02:51 The worst part about the two Kanan figures is that they're like jumping in opposite directions.
01:02:57 The idea is that the two characters are like shooting at each other.
01:02:59 So you buy both and it's set.
01:03:02 Which is a clever idea, except that if you have them displayed that way, you can't see
01:03:07 either of them.
01:03:08 Like they're both jumping away from each other and there's no way to make it so you
01:03:12 can see both of their fronts.
01:03:14 So it's the stupidest idea of a figure set ever and I hate it.
01:03:19 You know that just, this was another that's both related to figures and like a terrible
01:03:24 slash great purchase.
01:03:25 This was both a good and bad thing.
01:03:26 I know I've told the story before, but it's just like how I spent a billion million dollars
01:03:30 in like a Tokyo crane machine trying to win like the second half of my like CC or C2 and
01:03:37 Collins set.
01:03:38 A figure that probably cost $35.
01:03:40 I'm sure it was far less than the amount of money I spent.
01:03:42 But here they sit before me, link together in this sexy ass pose.
01:03:45 I'm looking right up C2's cunt.
01:03:48 It's great.
01:03:49 It's great, you know.
01:03:50 It's all good.
01:03:51 It's all good.
01:03:52 So that was both a terrible waste of money, but also it paid off long term.
01:03:54 All right.
01:03:55 Spooker asks, what are your most visited websites?
01:03:59 V, 4chan, V. That's like the number one I'm on on YouTube.
01:04:04 Tom?
01:04:06 Well, mostly I go to YouTube all the time.
01:04:10 I just I've researched tons of stuff on YouTube.
01:04:13 I have gone on Engadget every day for the last 10 years.
01:04:17 It's not an exaggeration.
01:04:18 Whoa.
01:04:19 What do they do there?
01:04:20 What is their thing?
01:04:21 It's just like a technology blog, but they're becoming super political.
01:04:24 So I'm like tempted to jump ship because it's starting to get gross.
01:04:30 And then let me guess, let me guess.
01:04:31 They love Donald Trump.
01:04:33 Oh, the best.
01:04:36 It's they're the most red-pilled site of all time.
01:04:39 It's great.
01:04:40 Yeah.
01:04:41 I don't know.
01:04:42 I don't really go to a lot of websites frequently.
01:04:45 I just kind of just does everything.
01:04:46 You know, Google.com because I've I've constantly needed to learn something and like Google has
01:04:52 got my back.
01:04:53 So it's yeah, very true.
01:04:56 My best friend of all time, monkey.
01:04:58 Yeah, I just go on all the standard shit.
01:05:01 I guess I also go to Reddit more than you guys probably.
01:05:03 Oh, we've got a redditor on our hands.
01:05:05 Folks, my fucking hero.
01:05:08 Well, I I'm one of those rare redditors who was mostly on the Donald.
01:05:11 So.
01:05:13 Right, of course.
01:05:14 I got it. Where else am I going to get real news?
01:05:16 Every other website is fake news.
01:05:19 Yeah, it's a conundrum.
01:05:21 I the websites I spend the most time on or without a doubt, YouTube and Twitter, because
01:05:25 that's where all my shitposting is.
01:05:27 But like, I just habitually like cycle through all my bookmarks constantly.
01:05:33 So I check my anime list every day and accept every friend request I get, which is like
01:05:38 three or four a day.
01:05:40 I check Gmail, obviously, Reddit.
01:05:44 I only go to Reddit for my own board.
01:05:47 I don't actually go anywhere.
01:05:48 The weirdest one I go to, though, is every day I go to GameFAQs and do the poll of the
01:05:53 day.
01:05:54 Oh, I did that for a long time.
01:05:55 I've done that for like a decade.
01:05:57 Like I've been I've voted in every poll of the day.
01:06:00 I feel like I'm going to go see today's really miss it.
01:06:02 Today's poll is, have you ever fallen asleep while playing a video game?
01:06:06 Absolutely.
01:06:07 And oh, did I ever tell you my nightmare story about how I had just caught a shiny butterfree
01:06:11 in the bug catching contest and fell asleep and the battery died and I fucking lost it?
01:06:15 Oh, no.
01:06:16 I wanted to fucking kill myself.
01:06:18 You should have.
01:06:19 I should have.
01:06:20 It was a nightmare.
01:06:21 It was literally the butterfree that cucked Ash out of his butterfree, the pink one that
01:06:25 stole it away.
01:06:26 I caught her, but I let her escape.
01:06:28 She slipped away.
01:06:30 Just like in the show.
01:06:31 God, shiny Pokemon horror stories are the worst.
01:06:33 I know.
01:06:34 I know.
01:06:35 I've only encountered one shiny Pokemon in my entire life and I was playing Pokemon Emerald
01:06:38 and it was a shiny wormhole, but it was before you got Pokeballs in the game.
01:06:42 Oh, no.
01:06:43 Oh, my God.
01:06:44 So evisceration.
01:06:45 Right.
01:06:46 That's the worst.
01:06:47 It was like the biggest cockslap I've ever gotten by God in my life.
01:06:51 I've got a shiny cottony in Sun and Moon.
01:06:54 It's the only shiny I've seen, but I got it.
01:06:56 I've actually caught kind of a lot.
01:06:58 I've caught like four or something over my career, which for somebody who just played,
01:07:02 I've like played every game through once, but I didn't like grind for any of them.
01:07:05 So I guess I'm kind of lucky.
01:07:07 Ben has never seen any, except for like red carrots, obviously.
01:07:10 He plays more Pokemon than both of us combined.
01:07:12 Yeah.
01:07:13 As far as I know.
01:07:14 Yeah.
01:07:15 It's just cray.
01:07:16 Yeah.
01:07:17 Yeah.
01:07:18 The game.
01:07:19 It's pretty much the coolest idea ever.
01:07:21 I fucking love it.
01:07:22 It's insane and nuts.
01:07:23 I love how low the percentage is.
01:07:25 It's great.
01:07:26 I love it.
01:07:27 Let's do one more questions.
01:07:28 Do we want to keep it going?
01:07:29 Let's do one more.
01:07:30 Let's get a big finish.
01:07:31 Okay.
01:07:32 The best question.
01:07:33 You want a real big epic finisher?
01:07:34 Yes.
01:07:35 Yes.
01:07:36 You want one that's going to tear our fucking listeners' ears pieces?
01:07:38 I'm ready.
01:07:39 Crafty asks, can y'all sing?
01:07:41 Oh.
01:07:42 When I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band.
01:07:53 He said something crazy story all about how my life got different upside down and I'd
01:08:00 like to take a minute to sit right there and I'll tell y'all to pretend it's all over
01:08:03 there.
01:08:04 I pulled up to the house around 7-8 and I helped to get to your home and told you later
01:08:09 to my kingdom.
01:08:10 I was like, why don't you let us sit around for a little while?
01:08:15 Let it go.
01:08:16 Let it go.
01:08:17 Let it go.
01:08:18 Let it go.
01:08:19 Let it go.
01:08:22 I want to change.
01:08:31 I'm not gonna stand here and wait.
01:08:38 hopefully Our wonderful editor will fade out at some point during that.
01:08:41 No, we're still going.
01:08:44 Don't cut it.
01:08:45 Don't cut it.
01:08:46 We're still going.
01:08:47 I guess that's true I'm just gonna say goodbye now. Bye. Bye. Goodbye. Fuck you
01:08:56 Sorry
01:09:17 My dick I'm jerking myself I'm sucking I am an asshole I am a stupid I've got a deadline don't want to do it
