00:00:00 I'm sorry darling, I'm listening to the PCP right now, it's so addis-
00:00:13 I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
00:00:42 And we got Nate Boy.
00:00:44 Maybe it's deeply repressed inner rage. I can relate to that. Hello everyone.
00:00:48 It's like when the anime girls kind of smile and they're like happy and hello, but then
00:00:54 you see the aura.
00:00:55 It's like that dope sakura, like inner sakura. It's inner mage. Inner mage is rage. So there's
00:01:01 mage and then rage.
00:01:02 On the inside.
00:01:03 She's called leaf, he'll stop changing my lore.
00:01:07 No, I'm making the lore right now. It's new, it's brand new. HD remix changed all that
00:01:12 code and it made the aspect ratio change the gameplay.
00:01:19 From its natural Lithuanian into English is now, lethal is rage now.
00:01:24 It's also a bit crunched and bit stretched and re-resed and re-uploaded and resized.
00:01:29 60 FPS.
00:01:30 Featuring Dante from the Devil May Crackers.
00:01:35 Well, okay, Tom, you're actually mad about something we want to hear about.
00:01:38 Alright, alright.
00:01:39 So what's that?
00:01:40 Let me tell you my story. This is like the pettiest rage, but it is rage and it pisses
00:01:44 me off. So I, as you know, me and Digi have this I Am Games channel and so I've been slowly
00:01:50 but surely acquiring more gaming things just to make the entire process more easy to do.
00:01:56 Like I spent all this time getting like a dedicated streaming thing set up and we have
00:02:00 like a server that has like 8 terabytes of storage so we can easily dump footage and crap
00:02:03 on there and any computer can access it and all that stuff.
00:02:05 But I'm also bringing all my game stuff because despite the title of the show, Digi is not
00:02:10 games, alright? He's not good at video games so I'm going to have to pick up all the slack
00:02:18 to make our show title not bullshit.
00:02:21 I Am Fraud.
00:02:22 Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I, the reason it's called I Am Games and not we are games is
00:02:29 because I'm the only one who's games.
00:02:30 I Am Games and not so games.
00:02:33 Exactly. He's not games at all.
00:02:35 This show is counterfeit.
00:02:37 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give us money anyways. So um, brought all of my games over, brought
00:02:42 all that shit but one of the things I kept forgetting was my switch dock because initially
00:02:47 I just put like the essentials in my car because I'm like I'm never going to use the switch
00:02:51 dock because I don't have a TV in there.
00:02:53 So but then once Digi's like just come bum at my house I'm like fine. So then all of
00:02:57 a sudden all this shit I ignored is now necessary again.
00:03:00 Yes.
00:03:02 I was thinking of maybe doing a video on Splatoon 2 for I Am Games and why it's like
00:03:06 I'll play the best multiplayer game ever and so I needed a pro controller but I didn't
00:03:12 want to spend a lot of money because I knew I wasn't going to use a pro controller all
00:03:15 that often because I find the Joy-Cons very comfortable.
00:03:18 Like if I, I like kind of just sitting on the couch without the grip and just having
00:03:21 one in each hand just kind of chilling and be like yeah I'm just playing a fucking video.
00:03:24 Do you use the little stand and prop it up on a table or something?
00:03:27 No, I mean if I'm playing like in handheld mode I will just put it on the TV in the dock
00:03:33 but when I'm just kind of chilling like on the couch I'll just pull the Joy-Cons off
00:03:38 and I won't put them in the grip. I'll just hold one in each hand and just kind of just
00:03:41 relax.
00:03:42 Wait but where's the screen? But where's the screen in this situation?
00:03:44 Oh that would be in the dock on the TV.
00:03:47 Oh oh it's oh okay alright.
00:03:49 Yeah so that's when I'm playing it in docked mode. In handheld mode I'll just play it in
00:03:52 handheld mode.
00:03:53 So I was like I need a new controller because I know in case Digi wants to play he wanted
00:03:57 an actual controller and if I want to play Splatoon 2 well for footage I'm gonna have
00:04:02 to like actually have a real controller.
00:04:04 So I went in to Walmart because I just happened to be there and I'm like I'm gonna get a controller
00:04:08 while I'm here but they're like $60 and I wasn't feeling that but I saw they also had wired
00:04:13 versions for $25 and I was like that's way better and it's like a Splatoon version of
00:04:21 the controller. I'm like this is like systematically relevant everything and it looks super fucking
00:04:24 cool. I'll put a picture up and I'll put it in the show notes or whatever so you can see
00:04:27 what it looks like because it looks dope as fuck.
00:04:30 So it's like alright and it's like Nintendo like made like a cheaper version for poor people.
00:04:35 I like it so I bought it and then I brought it home and I unboxed it and I realized I
00:04:40 made an error and the error is that it is not a Nintendo branded controller. They just
00:04:45 they used the Nintendo Switch logo and used the exact same design packaging as all the
00:04:50 other first party Switch accessories to make retards like me think it was first party and
00:04:56 then they have their logo is called Power A but it's designed on the package to look
00:05:01 just like a Nintendo logo because it's in like the kind of like rounded design. So when
00:05:06 you just look at it quickly like I did it reads exactly like a first party controller
00:05:10 and it has like all the right logos and everything on there and I was totally fucking livid because
00:05:16 I gave these motherfuckers who I don't even I haven't even tested this yet it could be
00:05:21 a piece of shit and I have no idea. It feels nice but but it's not Nintendo and I don't
00:05:26 buy third party controllers because they're always trash.
00:05:29 Okay so you got got by the marketing but it's possible it still works well.
00:05:33 It could be good. I don't know. I know I can definitely tell by holding it it probably
00:05:37 doesn't have like rumble or anything built in because it's very light but I don't really
00:05:40 care too much about rumble as long as the aiming is better so I don't look like an idiot
00:05:45 trying to play on IM games but I'm mad because it looks so cool and it has all the Splatoon
00:05:50 logos and it had the Nintendo Switch logo on the packaging and it looks straight up like
00:05:54 a Nintendo thing but they fooled me and I'm gonna burn this company to the ground. Power
00:05:59 A I'm coming for you. I'm gonna use my fucking power to shove it up your a-hole.
00:06:04 I definitely want to see a picture of this in the show notes or whatever.
00:06:06 Yeah I will.
00:06:07 Sounds fascinating.
00:06:09 I think like third party control I mean clearly they're they're being sneaky fucks and that's
00:06:15 not good but third party controllers are often you know good enough and I have a story.
00:06:21 I'd like to know whether it whether or not like update us on whether it works.
00:06:26 There's a sweet spot between the like just the up price because it's first party and
00:06:30 the like low point of just like an actually shitty right.
00:06:32 I have a small story also like so me and my boyfriend we have a
00:06:38 Xbox controllers for our PCs and they're pretty good but like they're getting on in
00:06:43 years and the wires are just like disconnecting from time to time so we decided to buy some
00:06:49 new controllers and we found some sort of like slightly cheaper ones and we bought them
00:06:53 and it turns out they were third party even though they looked exactly like the original
00:06:57 Xbox.
00:06:58 It just they didn't have that here.
00:07:00 Yeah they didn't they didn't have the X of where the Xbox was supposed to be the box
00:07:06 controller.
00:07:07 I hate when they do that to me.
00:07:08 The thing that amazed me.
00:07:09 Oh wait.
00:07:10 Yeah.
00:07:11 Just quickly and both of the controllers have bugs in them and it was so annoying.
00:07:15 Wait.
00:07:16 Actual literal bugs like creepy crawlies are like when one of them had like the button
00:07:22 was to it's like an actual like ant farm.
00:07:26 Now that would be cool.
00:07:27 I wouldn't complain about that.
00:07:28 Why would you not complain about that?
00:07:31 But I like ants and ant farms.
00:07:33 This is a cool thing.
00:07:34 I would like to have an ant farm.
00:07:36 Then you should be on the next bonus episode made.
00:07:38 Just all I'm saying.
00:07:39 I won't say any more than that.
00:07:40 I know.
00:07:41 I will be.
00:07:42 Shit.
00:07:43 This is for the viewers mage.
00:07:45 It's for the viewers.
00:07:46 Yeah.
00:07:47 My thing that pissed the reason I was so pissed is not because it's a third party controller.
00:07:51 It's because I was purchased under false pretenses.
00:07:54 If I said oh it's a third party controller that's why it's cheaper.
00:07:58 And it was like you remember back in the day when you bought like a mad cat's controller
00:08:01 because you were like 10 and your parents wouldn't spend the full money you're like at least
00:08:05 I know what I'm getting into.
00:08:06 It's clearly has like that obnoxious mad cat's logo with the paw and like the claw marks.
00:08:10 And you knew it wasn't legit.
00:08:12 This was lying to me.
00:08:14 And that's where my disdain comes from.
00:08:16 And you bought this in Walmart right?
00:08:18 Yes.
00:08:19 Yeah.
00:08:20 Okay.
00:08:21 It was with all the Nintendo accessories like all like the official controllers and
00:08:23 everything and right there it was just sitting there.
00:08:25 It wasn't off to the side.
00:08:27 It was among them.
00:08:28 It makes me think even the people who stocked it were confused.
00:08:32 I would not be shocked.
00:08:33 And I'm ready to go to war with this company.
00:08:35 Power A I'm coming for you.
00:08:37 You're gonna die.
00:08:38 I just want to say that fucking mad cats every time mad cats gets brought up I always have
00:08:44 to say my funny little little quip that mad cats is good and I don't know why people hate
00:08:50 it.
00:08:51 That was very funny.
00:08:53 It's funny because it's true.
00:08:54 I've had like the one PlayStation 2 controller that has survived since I was a child is the
00:08:59 mad cat's one.
00:09:00 All the others broke.
00:09:01 Well okay.
00:09:02 And the official ones died.
00:09:04 Yes.
00:09:05 Really?
00:09:06 I had to buy a new one.
00:09:07 They're still going strong.
00:09:08 Kind of recently.
00:09:09 Except for the ones that I smash in a rage when playing Soul Calibur 2.
00:09:11 I was gonna say is it because the other ones were launched through the TV in a bout of
00:09:15 impotent rage at Dark Souls or you know some other game.
00:09:19 That's on my diet.
00:09:20 That's unrelated.
00:09:21 That's not that's you know.
00:09:24 No they survived all of that.
00:09:25 It was for other reasons.
00:09:26 Other reasons.
00:09:27 Yeah.
00:09:28 Yeah.
00:09:29 Okay.
00:09:30 Those ants all over them.
00:09:32 They took them out of my picnic basket and they.
00:09:34 Hey I do want to say though the the the I know I say this all the time but like my Nintendo
00:09:40 Switch pro controller it's like the actual on-brand one.
00:09:43 Like I actually love it and it's one of my favorite controllers ever.
00:09:46 Man.
00:09:47 It feels great.
00:09:48 Okay.
00:09:49 Here's actually a question about the pro controller.
00:09:50 The pro controller itself has the analog sticks like on the same side right.
00:09:55 Like they're like on each side and then the buttons are below it because like.
00:09:59 No actually no it's set up the way that switches with like on the left the the the thumb stick
00:10:04 is up top on the right down below that is that is the proper way to have those.
00:10:08 That's one thing that still pisses me off about PlayStation controllers that the analog
00:10:11 sticks are too close to each other and I'm not five and my hands need more clearance
00:10:15 than that.
00:10:16 This controller has them set up properly which is why I'm okay with it.
00:10:18 They're offset ever since the OG Xbox did that that should have become the standard.
00:10:23 I think that PlayStation just got so like the layout of the PlayStation control is kind
00:10:28 of like on brand.
00:10:29 It is.
00:10:30 I think they just don't want to change it.
00:10:31 But I still don't like it as much and that's as a hardcore Sony fanboy.
00:10:35 That's my one point of contention.
00:10:37 It's like you got to give props to for Sony to like for implementing the DualShox system
00:10:42 because they invented it and it's totally awesome but like they got a little bit it's
00:10:46 like when you invent something but then someone else makes a better version like you want
00:10:49 to stick with this like one that you made because it's like the special one that's special
00:10:52 to you and shit but really there's probably better ways to be doing things that other
00:10:56 people figure out.
00:10:58 There's like a third party that did make a PlayStation 4 controller that is just an
00:11:02 Xbox controller that works in PlayStation and I'm very tempted to try it at some point.
00:11:07 Well that's dope.
00:11:08 Maybe some but I don't play shooters on PlayStation so it really doesn't matter at that point.
00:11:12 Tom let's please play Splatoon with me online.
00:11:15 I want to play Splatoon with someone.
00:11:16 Do you have Nintendo online since you have to pay now?
00:11:19 I got the one week free trial that I probably already like I was complaining about the fact
00:11:24 that I had to pay for it on I Am Games and someone DM'd me yesterday and said oh I have
00:11:28 the part they're like family plan just give me your email and I'll add you so now I have
00:11:33 what dude.
00:11:34 Yeah they just they added me for free.
00:11:35 I'm like you're a fucking hero.
00:11:36 Adopt me and get me on your family plan too.
00:11:39 I want to be your son sir.
00:11:41 Maybe you should you should you should ask them I'll see if they said they have like
00:11:45 three slots open and nothing to do with them so they might actually put me in your slot
00:11:48 friend put me in your fucking slot I will wait to hear from you whoever you are out there
00:11:53 because I was I was about to buy it the other day and you know what like it's $20 for a year
00:11:59 like it sucks that we have to pay and it's utterly retarded but like okay I can afford
00:12:03 that I can afford $20 and you get NES games which I guess but the NES lineup is really
00:12:07 shit but at least it's something.
00:12:10 It is it's more than absolutely zero I guess so I mean I would just emulate any of those
00:12:14 games but you know whatever you know sometimes you know there's a thing where like that we
00:12:21 have infinite games our disposal via emulators basically but like I don't actually play like
00:12:26 any of those games just because I don't think about them and I don't like come up that's
00:12:30 it's Nintendo can just prompt me on my switch when they like hey we just downloaded like
00:12:34 I don't know Excitebike for you I've never played Excitebike that's in Smash Bros.
00:12:39 Let me see what the fucking excitement's about.
00:12:41 It's funny because me and Digi were talking about this on IM Games about how yeah when
00:12:45 emulators like became a thing and I did the same thing with my DS because I had like the
00:12:50 flash card that let you just like down I love my flash card on my DS yeah it's just like
00:12:54 you play a game for like 20 minutes like oh I wonder what else I can play and then you
00:12:57 get spoiled yeah fucking spoiled when you never follow through but when you were 10 and you
00:13:02 had an N64 you played Star Fox 64 for years because that's all you had and you had to
00:13:08 make it work.
00:13:09 I see this as a possible death of humanity like that like access to infinite information
00:13:15 will make us all like not give a shit about anything.
00:13:18 I call it death by decadence we've become so fucking privileged to have all this entertainment
00:13:24 at our fingertips so we don't value any of it anymore.
00:13:27 That's what killed the Roman Empire as I recall something like that.
00:13:30 By the way Gibb appears to have just died oh excuse me oh no I really hope he didn't
00:13:35 restart his audio because I don't feel like editing more than that.
00:13:39 It would just be his internet.
00:13:43 Well okay well let's let him go and we'll see if he joins back.
00:13:47 I did have another subject to bring it's a totally left turn from here.
00:13:51 Go for it man.
00:13:52 I'm done.
00:13:53 I rage is vented.
00:13:54 I feel better.
00:13:55 Good.
00:13:56 So I just got back I took me and the lady and the dog went to a place nearby at her at
00:14:05 her suggestion a place called Findlay Market in Cincinnati it's like a it's like an open
00:14:12 air market and it's very similar to I think it's Quincy Market in Boston Tom you know
00:14:18 the one I'm talking about that that place Munchie takes us to and we went to it's got
00:14:22 like that Dix last resort and all those whatever the market is in Boston I can't remember Findlay
00:14:28 Market is like that in Cincinnati and I just we were there and we were there for like an
00:14:33 hour or two and we walked around we had the dog it was fun and like the point I'm trying
00:14:38 to get to with this was I had such a wonderful time just like being out among normal human
00:14:44 beings and like experiencing what it's like to just be a normal human not trapped on the
00:14:51 internet you know just slowly seeking or allowing my life to have away into the electronic data
00:14:57 sphere.
00:14:58 Um everyone was just like cool and we got delicious food and it was just a great time
00:15:04 and I saw human beings like being nice to each other and I'm just like the internet
00:15:09 is so shit uh like Twitter and all these like people sniping each other with like uh fucking
00:15:15 videos attacking other people and and all that stuff I hate all that hey get hey welcome
00:15:21 welcome.
00:15:22 Don't you hate it when you disconnect at the exact moment where you think you like people
00:15:27 have stepped aside to let you speak and then you say something for a while and.
00:15:32 That is unfortunate.
00:15:33 Do you want to finish a point or anything?
00:15:35 Uh I was just gonna ask uh how big can a Nintendo family be on the online thing.
00:15:40 I believe it's up to eight people.
00:15:41 I think you guys have three.
00:15:42 Oh.
00:15:43 Oh eight.
00:15:44 It's eight.
00:15:45 Yeah okay.
00:15:46 It's eight.
00:15:47 This man should legally adopt me.
00:15:48 Yes.
00:15:49 That's what should happen.
00:15:51 What's happening now then?
00:15:52 Well give I just brought up that I just got back from this place called Findlay Market
00:15:56 which is like remember that open-air market in Boston that we all went to and hung out
00:16:00 with that Munchie brought us to you know.
00:16:02 Uh yeah.
00:16:03 You know what I'm talking about.
00:16:04 Well whatever like I had been there before when I was young but I just remember I associate
00:16:07 with Munchie now um but like I went to I just found one Michelle found one uh from a friend
00:16:13 uh in Cincinnati called Findlay Market and like I just had such a great time just hanging
00:16:18 out me and her and the dog walking around and just like doing stuff we're gonna go dude
00:16:23 okay here's an amazing thing it's pretty close to the University of Cincinnati which
00:16:26 is like a pretty pretty nice thing it draws a lot of tourists and stuff.
00:16:29 There are just this is real this is real there are just electronic scooters around this market
00:16:37 that they just leave for anyone to just use and when you're done you simply just like
00:16:42 leave it on the sidewalk you don't like put it anywhere specifically and just walk away
00:16:48 and you're done and that's it and then someone else can just take it and use it for a while
00:16:52 and apparently the system just like works great and I guess they don't get stolen extremely
00:16:58 quickly.
00:16:59 So this is me a story I was told by my sister's boyfriend's husband actually right now.
00:17:05 Do you see her boyfriend's husband?
00:17:07 No my my sister's boyfriend but he's a husband now I remember they got married.
00:17:12 Oh right.
00:17:13 Yeah so so like her boyfriend has a husband it's a very complicated relationship.
00:17:18 Yeah.
00:17:19 No.
00:17:20 Anywho so so in the opinion they apparently had a similar sort of setup system with orange
00:17:26 bikes and that they were gonna you know all you just gonna take with the bike and you
00:17:31 know you place it down and someone else can use it yada yada but apparently it backfired
00:17:36 so badly because all the bikes got stolen and repainted and I just I just thought what
00:17:41 did you expect?
00:17:42 Google does the same thing.
00:17:43 That's what I would expect too.
00:17:45 The thing is though they're actually like this scooter thing is like specifically for
00:17:49 this marketplace Finlay market but around UC University of Cincinnati like there's a
00:17:53 system of like these red bikes because it's like red is like the color of UC and whatever.
00:17:57 There's like tons of like these red bike rental booths where you you know you put in quarter
00:18:01 and you take like the bike out or whatever and then you just return it to like because
00:18:05 there's lots of stations to like dock them.
00:18:08 So those have like a pickup and drop off point these scooters do not which is true like who
00:18:13 charges them at the end of the day.
00:18:15 I know they're not but every time you say scooter I just imagine people on razor scooters
00:18:18 and shit and it's evidently funny to me and you know what you know I know I'm on a tangent
00:18:23 here but this just reminds me of like before we went you know I did I mention that for
00:18:28 Michelle's birthday I bought her like a boosted board type electric skateboard yeah it's called
00:18:35 it's an Adam is the brand but it's dope like I just for fun I just put on my helmet went
00:18:40 outside and just like skateboarded around and had such a great time.
00:18:45 Just like doing things in real life is like fun and good you guys I just want to let you
00:18:49 know.
00:18:50 I can't believe you that sounds that sounds terrifying to me.
00:18:54 It's great.
00:18:55 I love it.
00:18:56 Maybe.
00:18:57 I'll consider that.
00:18:58 Dude okay it's like imagine Pokemon Go but like without the phone and just like but you
00:19:03 leave the real life there and like that's what it is like imagine that I don't know about
00:19:09 that.
00:19:10 I actually did regret not bringing my Pokemon Go.
00:19:16 I mean I I don't know my general like location in the world is like kind of boring if just
00:19:23 to walk around electric skateboard you can make it fun by just scooting.
00:19:27 Yeah but there's like this is like Casey Neistat just does what he does he has his electric
00:19:30 skateboard and he's he's it makes everything more fun maybe Casey Neistat has been called
00:19:35 a professional fun haver which I think is a very accurate title man but I like him.
00:19:40 Like it's just like everything around is just suburban houses for miles because we're on
00:19:48 the edge of London.
00:19:49 Literally dab on them on your electric skateboard as you cruise by it's just it's just nothing
00:19:54 much like like if I went into London if I went if I went into London then I would be
00:20:01 like I can see like stuff happening like there's people and there's buildings and it's cool
00:20:06 and there's a river.
00:20:07 I love rivers.
00:20:08 I love looking at the river.
00:20:09 I love looking at the river when when the sun's going down and it's shimmery shining all
00:20:13 over it.
00:20:14 That's good.
00:20:15 Oh that reminds me while I was heading back home to England I was in London waiting for
00:20:20 my train and I saw a guy that looked kind of like you just a little bit taller and I just
00:20:25 I dropped kicked him.
00:20:27 No he was on the opposite side of the of the track so you wanted to drop kick him but you
00:20:32 didn't have the opportunity.
00:20:33 Got a running start in this fucking power kick.
00:20:36 Launched across the track.
00:20:38 I stared at him like with squinty eyes I was like is that is that hippo is that no that
00:20:43 can be hippo.
00:20:44 Oh I saw I saw Digi in May out at just at this market and by that I mean there was just
00:20:51 a big bearded guy with Lenin shades and some girl with him and I was like there they are
00:20:57 that's them.
00:21:00 Disgusting.
00:21:01 Shout out to all these fakers at the King Richard's Fair right now I believe is where
00:21:07 they actually were.
00:21:08 Oh King Richard's Fair going on.
00:21:09 I think that's where they are right now they went to some sort of medieval fair and I was
00:21:11 supposed to go.
00:21:12 Oh that's dope.
00:21:13 That's dope.
00:21:14 We should talk about that.
00:21:15 Yeah.
00:21:16 I love where King Richard's Fair is going.
00:21:17 I went once back in a day when I was a wee lad and it was the funnest ship it was super
00:21:20 fucking cool.
00:21:21 Yeah.
00:21:22 Jousting is awesome and it should not have gone away.
00:21:25 In fact we should have just adapted to the times.
00:21:27 Yeah we do that now on electric skateboards might do.
00:21:30 I was going to say we should just have people in fucking cars or motorcycles jousting.
00:21:34 Yeah that's it.
00:21:35 That'd be fucking sick.
00:21:36 Like modern.
00:21:37 That'd be a good video game so how much would you make that make a video game that's just
00:21:41 like jousting 2089 or something or like you get like shiny red boxing gloves on a boosted
00:21:47 board you go as fast as you possibly can and it's like that'd be dope and you just try
00:21:52 to knock the other person out.
00:21:53 Tony Hawk's pro jousting.
00:21:54 Let's do it.
00:21:55 Hell yeah.
00:21:56 Hey I think I've told all my interesting King Richard's fair stories but like that's
00:22:00 where I got my ridiculous $100 floppy vampire 100D hat which is a complete goof.
00:22:05 I have to get that hat sent to me by my mom sometime.
00:22:07 You really do.
00:22:08 It needs to be in the next raton.
00:22:10 And take a picture with it.
00:22:12 Oh actually my mom is coming to visit me soon and she's bringing a certain key shaped item
00:22:18 that's of particular significance to me which I cannot wait to have for various purposes.
00:22:22 I can only imagine.
00:22:24 Yeah.
00:22:25 Or is it a key shaped item or is it a key shaped item?
00:22:29 It's a key.
00:22:30 No it actually is a key shaped item because it's distinctly not the key shaped.
00:22:34 That would be more of like a sword.
00:22:37 And what was I going to say?
00:22:38 Whatever.
00:22:39 Get the D hat while you're at it.
00:22:41 Oh King Richard's fair.
00:22:42 I was just going to say about that.
00:22:45 Did I talk about that time that me and my friends were at King Richard's fair.
00:22:49 We were in high school at the time.
00:22:50 I was like 15.
00:22:52 And like just like one of the court gestures at the fair comes up and is like hey my strapping
00:22:58 young, young, young, young lords.
00:23:01 How dost thou wish to partake of this quest to be knighted by ye old king?
00:23:07 And we're like yeah Nibba whatever you say.
00:23:10 And so we did this quest.
00:23:13 It was a scavenger hunt.
00:23:14 We had to go around.
00:23:15 It was me and like two of my friends.
00:23:17 I think Colin and like Nick or something.
00:23:19 I forget who I was with.
00:23:20 And we just went up to like stall vendors and they would give us quests.
00:23:26 They would give us little tasks to do.
00:23:28 But the thing was like they were definitely making them up as they went along.
00:23:31 They just like had like a stamp or something we had to get from them.
00:23:34 And so go kill that guy.
00:23:37 Kill these homeless people there then mucking up the joint.
00:23:40 They were things like do a jig or like like sing a song.
00:23:45 At one point someone just said like hey sing a song.
00:23:48 And by the way I had my really long hair at this point so I already looked like a strange
00:23:52 cryptid individual.
00:23:54 And this one lady who was like the beer wench or something she asked us to sing a song and
00:24:00 I was like guys what should we sing?
00:24:01 They're like I don't know.
00:24:02 And so I busted out a rendition of Yellow Submarine.
00:24:07 A rousing.
00:24:08 I don't know it was like the song of note at that time in our lives for whatever reason.
00:24:13 So I think we sang it at Boy Scout meetings a lot.
00:24:16 So I sang Yellow Submarine and the lady was so impressed by my rendition that she was
00:24:20 like dude you should like work here.
00:24:21 She like broke character and like told me I should like get a job and I was like well
00:24:26 thank you.
00:24:27 I appreciate that.
00:24:28 You could be like what's it called a minstrel?
00:24:31 A minstrel yeah I could definitely be a minstrel or a game wizard.
00:24:35 And if you took that job you'd be singing Yellow Submarine to this day at that fair.
00:24:40 That's true.
00:24:41 I'm trapped.
00:24:42 I can't.
00:24:43 Think about it you could have been in real life all the time.
00:24:51 So the end of this tale is we went around we did like 10 of these incredibly humiliating
00:24:56 tasks.
00:24:57 One was like run as fast as you can around the entire fairground.
00:25:03 So catch me like age 15 with my longass hair sprinting at top speed around these like knights
00:25:09 Gestures and wizards and just you know people in like weird steampunk and goth clothing because for some reason those people are attracted to
00:25:17 medieval fairs
00:25:19 And and then you know we got all the stamps
00:25:21 so we go to like the the ceremony at the end and we were like we're waiting for a while because we go to like where like the
00:25:27 end line is and
00:25:28 Like this guy's like yeah, the like the nighting ceremony is at you know X time. We're like, okay
00:25:33 Well, we'll just chill and so the the a horrible realization dawns on us as we
00:25:40 Like the people start to file in as the as the rose like in front of the stage where the person's gonna come out begin to fill with
00:25:47 Incredibly young children
00:25:50 Five and six maybe up to like ten and we're just kind of standing in the back like what what is what's happening right now and
00:25:58 Outcomes like the king which I believe is the actual like guys playing the king of King Richard's Fair
00:26:02 He's just like oh my noble knights
00:26:04 Thank you for doing this quest come forth on stage me hearties and be crowned lords of
00:26:11 Cinder or whatever. He loves Dark Souls
00:26:16 I would say Dark Souls theme Renaissance fair that would that would be incredible
00:26:20 So you are like the oldest people there
00:26:22 We were like by ten years or so the oldest people doing the whole thing six like I like the fucking court jester played the ultimate prank on
00:26:30 Us by getting us to do this fucking nighting ceremony that was for babies
00:26:35 And no one along the entire time said like aren't you guys a little old to be doing this like this is for actual babies
00:26:41 Why are you but no this me and my two friends were deeply humiliated we walk up nighted like yeah
00:26:48 We're so good at doing quests and being cool guys
00:26:51 And we get knighted which was fine. I guess that's why until this last past week. They never went to real life ever again
00:26:59 That's right. That's exactly it. Yeah, it was deeply embarrassing, but you know, it's okay, but you're a knight now
00:27:07 Yeah, it does and I'm a literal knight now
00:27:11 I I want to what's the I want to exert my my right to
00:27:15 To say the thing we're allowed to fuck a guy's wife after he gets married, you know, because you're the Lord or whatever
00:27:20 It's called America
00:27:25 We're bringing it back, baby
00:27:27 That's the main conservative platform I think to reinstate that policy. I agree. Um, yeah, well, that's my story
00:27:36 Speaking speaking of real life in general a little bit of a follow-up to last episode where I was talking about like the cgp
00:27:44 Gray thing of like getting rid of distractions internet-based
00:27:49 Things such as websites and podcasts and stuff
00:27:54 I have stopped listening to all podcasts including hello internet even though I really like it and
00:28:00 I've downloaded this thing onto my onto my computer onto chrome
00:28:06 Which is like a a task focus assistant thing which
00:28:12 It doesn't block sites. I can still type them in but when I go there it immediately comes up with a notification saying
00:28:18 You're not supposed to be here
00:28:20 Here's what you're supposed to be doing and it lists the tasks that I've listed for that day or any tasks that I have not finished
00:28:27 And at the moment my task is do bail jpew stupid idiot and that keeps coming up every time I go to Twitter and I'm like, ah
00:28:34 Yeah, you know, I could I could click like right click on the top right and find the thing to settings and then I'm like
00:28:43 Match Twitter from the list of sites that get you know blocked or yeah, yeah, but then that there's too much effort
00:28:49 So I'm like fine like and I it has been helpful in just not
00:28:55 Making me go to Twitter and and read it and stuff
00:28:58 We should we should steal that technology and make our own
00:29:02 Application that does that and called the like the procrastinators branded anti procrastination tool and when you go to a site that like isn't the
00:29:08 Why did you just play you're supposed to be working right now?
00:29:13 Yeah, we actually should but
00:29:16 But like yeah, I mean we definitely should because this this app is insidious. It's it's really it's really
00:29:24 It's got a devious twist to it
00:29:27 because
00:29:28 After a certain amount of time after a certain amount of like site blocking activity
00:29:33 It jumps in and says well, you know, we've blocked sites for a little while
00:29:37 But if you want to block sites forever, you're gonna have to pay you're gonna have to pay a monthly fee
00:29:43 That's so fucked up that it would do that and I'm like I'm it's there's so many other apps that do what you do
00:29:51 With just a little bit less flair, but they just they block URLs and that's fine
00:29:57 And this one just had a nice like
00:30:00 Focus task list built into it and they expect me to to not go to something else
00:30:06 Like why would it's it's stupid? I'm not gonna pay money
00:30:11 I'm not gonna pay money for the privilege of me being unable to go to certain places
00:30:16 Yeah, it's tough to motivate that I
00:30:19 Don't I don't think that thing would work on me because I have like an incredible
00:30:26 Rebellious streak of like when you'd someone tells me not to do something. I'd be like screw you. I'm gonna do the thing now
00:30:32 You just need the opposite that you're like, yeah, fuck you mage
00:30:35 You're not gonna work on your shit today. You're like, yeah, watch me bitch
00:30:38 This reminds me. I don't know. Maybe this will be gross for people. I don't know
00:30:42 It's not that big a thing, but it's like this reminds me when I was young like I to this day
00:30:45 I still bite my nails a ton and it's it's gross and I always say it's the worst thing about me that I bite my nails so much
00:30:52 but
00:30:54 In fact, I'm doing it literally right now. I have a peak. I have pliers not pliers
00:30:59 What is it nail clippers? No, they're not nail like I have like a little edge trimmer's
00:31:05 It's a tweezers. I have tweezers in my hand right now. I was picking in my hands with I'm gonna put it down and stop doing it
00:31:10 Okay, but what I was doing or what I was saying was like when I was young my mom really she was good
00:31:15 She tried to head this off at the pass and like stopped me biting my nails then because she knew if she got got me when I was young
00:31:22 I wouldn't do it, but it's way too late now
00:31:24 and so she bought the stuff that was like
00:31:28 Like it's it's nail polish that just like tastes bad
00:31:31 And the point of it is just you put it on your nails and when you taste it you're like, oh shit
00:31:35 I shouldn't be doing this right now. The problem was you got addicted to that taste
00:31:41 Basically, it wasn't that I like would it was addicted, but it's like biting my nails is like super fun
00:31:47 Like I love doing it. It's just like it's super fucked up and strange, but I get a like picking a scab
00:31:54 It's it's just something I can do anytime and it's really gross and disgusting
00:31:57 But I do it anyway
00:31:58 And so like this this was just what it's supposed to do is remind you that you need to stop like that
00:32:04 This this nail polish is designed to just remind your brain like hey remember you shouldn't be doing this
00:32:09 Don't do this unconsciously, but my will to do it is active and powerful
00:32:13 Because it just is fun being the basket
00:32:15 We're just like this is now painful. This is a challenge. I need to overcome it kind of yeah kind of yeah
00:32:22 I all right
00:32:22 I may have said this on the rebellious spirit mage on this podcast before but yeah the way to combat any and all like nail
00:32:30 fidgeting like things yeah is to start playing guitar
00:32:34 Because having long nails is absolutely, you know the wrong thing
00:32:38 You can't have long nails at any point and you know get into a habit of just cutting them
00:32:43 Really short all the time my nails are already incredibly short though because I just how do you so much?
00:32:49 Yeah, but also a better way to keep them short. I actually tutorial on Phil Collins
00:32:55 No, yeah, it was no wasn't Phil Collins
00:32:57 It was I was confused him with this other guy that my dad likes from likes from like main or something
00:33:01 She had I can't remember but he the point is he had a long thumbnail for picking them strings on the guitar
00:33:07 Some nail he was signed by fucking Apple records. He like met Paul McCartney. What's his name?
00:33:13 He's like rockabye sweet, baby James Taylor. That's it. Okay, just want to remember that name
00:33:19 Okay, I actually if a funny that hippo brings up like the clipping of the nails thing
00:33:24 Because like I I also used to have like a nail biting problem not too big
00:33:28 But it was a bit of an issue
00:33:30 But the way I grew out of it is because it is when when I turned like 12 or 13
00:33:35 I realized when I grow out of my nails, they kind of look nice
00:33:37 so I decided to start growing out my nails and I never buy with my nails since and I grow out my nails and they look
00:33:44 Really cool and like scary and I like that
00:33:47 there's some of this much under reported female privilege because because there is a societal
00:33:54 Expectation to look not disgusting and terrible unlike the ghouls that are men in the society
00:34:00 You were given an incentive to improve your nail hygiene unlike me
00:34:04 I mean, I just it just looked nice for me personally
00:34:09 I mean, I thought that people expected me to look nice. I already had nice nails
00:34:14 So I guess I was born with the privilege of having
00:34:19 I never like bit my nails
00:34:22 One time one time I heard that that was the thing and I tried biting my nails and it was like that
00:34:26 How do you supposed to get a grip on that? That's that that's too much. Oh, you just get in there and you fuck
00:34:30 I just know but like instead of that
00:34:32 I would I would pick at my nails with my other nails, you know, yeah, okay
00:34:36 I would rip them off like that
00:34:37 We're talking about biting nails because when I was a young lad in like second grade
00:34:41 I thought that my nails were
00:34:44 Deformed and the reason I did is because everyone around me bit their nails and I didn't I thought that's what normal nails looked like
00:34:51 And mine always looks like different and I was like why what what happened?
00:34:56 Why are my hands so fucked up and it took forever for me to realize? Oh, I'm just not an autist like everyone
00:35:02 That reminds me of you ever watch you know report of the week, you know report of the week the youtuber
00:35:06 I do not enlighten me. Okay. He's a very pale strange cryptid of a man
00:35:11 Who wears a suit every day of his life vastly oversized ill-fitting suit and slicks his hair back
00:35:17 Yeah, he loves vintage fashion. Yeah, that guy and he does he does fast food and energy to drink reviews. Whoa
00:35:23 And I love him. It's hello everyone. Welcome to running on empty
00:35:31 Yeah, that sounds like him that's the sort of shit he does with his life for some reason
00:35:35 But I mean he's got like a million subscribers or whatever, but the point is
00:35:39 He he famously among his many quirks and strange things about his appearance and a personality
00:35:46 Is that he has very long fingernails and they people describe those vampire ish and skeletal
00:35:52 And it at some point it's a bigger issue
00:35:57 You know, I guess not but okay, maybe vampire
00:36:02 Vampiric dammit. All right, and he made a video addressing it at some point
00:36:07 It's like well, I just happened to like having long nails. I'm just there's no need to fuss
00:36:12 There's no need to muss. I just like my nails this way and that's all there is to say
00:36:20 He is a weird guy, but I like him a lot I like him a lot
00:36:23 He occasionally beefs with Anthony Fantano in a completely one-sided way
00:36:27 Nate since I know you had long hair. Did you ever had like the quirk of like?
00:36:32 Chewing on your hair, you know, I know some people did I never had that I never had that I had that for a while
00:36:38 I don't know how it got out of it, but I'm glad I I did that a little bit
00:36:42 I didn't chew on it, but I just would put it in my mouth. Yeah. Yeah
00:36:46 When I was young, this is just semi-relevant when I was a very young
00:36:49 I had a blankie and would suck my thumb
00:36:52 Excessively and paired this blankie with me everywhere. This is such an embarrassing episode
00:36:58 This is fine. I was so young. I'm not embarrassed by it at this point
00:37:02 Last week so we can this is last week. Yeah, I'm a totally different person
00:37:07 What is embarrassing though is that I would do weird fucked-up shit with that blanket like like shove it up my nose a little bit and like
00:37:14 Yeah, it was weird. All right. All right get this was the weirdest thing about that blankie
00:37:19 Here's what I would do like I had this blank since I was like born and so he got completely shredded over the years until there
00:37:24 Was just like a tiny little square with a bunny in the center remained
00:37:29 And like here's what I would do. I remembered very well in my left hand. I would clutch it in my hand
00:37:34 I would suck on my thumb and I would here's my okay. This is weird
00:37:38 I would take like one of the bigger fragments of cloth. I would kind of turn it into like a big loop
00:37:43 I would put that loop
00:37:45 It you know because if my hands clenched my thumbs in my mouth and in that loop
00:37:48 I would put in my nose and I would breathe through the loop and that was pure bliss as a human
00:37:54 My life when I was like five. Yeah, I just want to
00:37:58 Sometimes just one how these series of events played out that you happen to do that the first time and got positive
00:38:04 Like feedback and like this is something I'm going to continue to do
00:38:07 I think it was like an evolution of behavior patterns where I just tried a bunch of shit and then like that one stuck after a while
00:38:13 I mean, I don't know. I also try shot at my nose
00:38:18 Since we're sharing weird habits, I have a question like for you guys and for everyone that's listening out there
00:38:23 This is something I used to do like do you know like the sort of like
00:38:27 Back in the day do they even do those like sort of white glue sort of thing, but it wasn't like strong
00:38:33 I don't know
00:38:36 It was just like white glue and it didn't stick too much to you
00:38:40 Well enough, but you know, they let kids wait. Did you like you like use like a stick to spread it around I
00:38:47 No, no, no, no, like I would like I put it on my on my palm and I would spread it around and I wait for it to feel it
00:38:52 Yeah, yeah, I wait for it to drive it and then feel it and it looked like skin
00:38:57 Oh
00:38:59 That's the thing that I did on occasion, but not very often my friends didn't know off and I was like, oh, I guess I'll try it
00:39:05 I should do that to my dick and make dick molds. It was sick
00:39:09 That's not that's not an accurate
00:39:11 We called it PVA glue and and and there was all it was always used
00:39:17 When it was as a child there's always in school like sticking things on paper because you know, that's that's basically
00:39:24 That's like 90% of schooling is sticking things on things
00:39:27 And so like you had two choices you had the Pritt stick which was like the the the squishy tube of glue that you could like it twist
00:39:35 stick, yeah, we the Pritt
00:39:38 Pritt was like the brand name I guess and and then they'd have PVA glue and
00:39:46 That's my story
00:39:49 Okay, I just I mean I don't want to say like the same thing may said because yes, I did
00:39:55 Try to dissuade me from doing that because they were concerned I might get like
00:39:59 Addicted to the to the smell of the glue because that was a thing
00:40:03 I think I was more I was more interested in the than the peeling of the skin glue
00:40:09 Yeah, there was this one time where my grandpa was showing me like
00:40:14 you know model making with the glue and like
00:40:18 Little plane because he was an RAF guy and he has like little model plane thing
00:40:21 And it was like we were we were building it together and I had the glue thing and it was one of those like smelly types of glue
00:40:28 In a little metal tiny little metal thing and I was sniffing it and I was like this smells really good
00:40:34 And I I said to my grandpa like do you know how nice this smells grandpa?
00:40:39 Like I had no idea it was a bad thing and he got really upset at me
00:40:42 And I was really sad and and afraid that I had mucked up so bad that I was doing something illegal in front of my grandpa
00:40:49 And I didn't even realize
00:40:55 And from that day on I never had a grandpa he disowned
00:41:00 He jumped in that little model airplane you flew away never came back
00:41:03 I
00:41:08 Was thinking about the nails again
00:41:10 I I still have like a bad habit of like biting them
00:41:13 But only like if I break one of my long nails and it's like uneven it drives me crazy
00:41:17 That like if I don't don't have like scissors near me, then I'll start
00:41:22 Yeah, it's just just right. It's so insane enough enough gross disgusting nails
00:41:29 Let's move on to my topic that I have okay
00:41:33 Adventure time ended
00:41:34 Yes, I did I haven't been keeping up with it for a while and I've decided to re
00:41:40 Watch the whole thing and I'm in sort of the middle of season two
00:41:45 Season one and season two are like the best thing I've ever seen like this surprisingly perfect like
00:41:52 I would recommend anybody who has not watched adventure time in a long time to go back and watch all of season one
00:41:58 It's all killer no filler ten out of ten like the best cartoon I've ever seen in my life
00:42:05 Wait, sorry, I I was distracted during that please repeat all those words
00:42:11 Adventure time is good season one is the best cartoon on TV. How much of it did you rewatch?
00:42:16 Did you rewatch the whole thing? I I rewatch all of see I haven't gotten around to all of it yet
00:42:20 I rewatch season one and I'm in halfway through season two and it is ten out of ten cartoon
00:42:26 I
00:42:27 Would you say where's the drop-off happen like season five season six? I I have no idea
00:42:31 That's why I'm rewatching to find out but like
00:42:35 I'm just saying like like though. There's a reason that cartoon contributed to like every cartoon in the world
00:42:42 In that style I was watching it as I came out and it's just like so fucking good
00:42:47 It's it's the writing like surprisingly you think of a adventure time
00:42:52 You think oh, it's just wacky and funny and and it looks very simplistic
00:42:57 But like everything that that that's all wrongs all misconceptions. You've all remembered it incorrectly
00:43:03 It's it's got it's got brilliant writing brilliant comedic writing and the animation at least in season one and the beginning of season two is like
00:43:11 The reason it looks so simplistic is because they want to do so much with the animation that if it was more complicated
00:43:18 They wouldn't be able to do it on the budget. They had yeah
00:43:20 So they do some really impressive looking incredible stuff because there's only so many lines and colors
00:43:26 They have to put on let's let's lay it on the line. Let's lay it on the line
00:43:30 Let's say you have to obliterate
00:43:33 Adventure time or Steven Universe and everyone involved in either's production
00:43:38 Who do you kill? Who do you?
00:43:40 I'll kill Steven Universe. Yeah, I think the problem is if you obliterated adventure time
00:43:45 You'd kill a bunch of people who work on Steven Universe as well. So you wouldn't get either. Yeah, Rebecca sugar worked on adventure time
00:43:50 She did. Oh, well, okay in that case we definitely are
00:43:54 Cuz it's
00:43:57 It's it's just it's hard to explain
00:44:00 Exactly why it's like so perfect, but it's
00:44:03 It's like it's it's from the the perspective of a child
00:44:06 I think it's the the writing is so good because they know how to write good episodes like every episode is a great episode
00:44:13 but like
00:44:14 They understand storywriting in a way that they can do matter and they can do matter properly by having the story just go in a different direction
00:44:22 Like at the last second or like they can they can like the first episode of season season two
00:44:31 Finn and Marceline like Marceline's dad comes back and all that
00:44:35 He's fucking up everything and the thing fries episode
00:44:38 Yeah, why did you steal my fries and all that stuff and Finn and Marceline are going around adventuring and at the end
00:44:46 It's revealed to the Jake
00:44:48 You know for some reason was absent
00:44:50 But he was actually in Finn's pocket the entire time and he turns around at the end like like Marceline asks. Oh
00:44:57 I've been wondering what's with your your pocket
00:44:59 Yeah, Finn and then Finn goes oh Jake's in here and then Jake is like tiny he turns around he farts
00:45:06 And that's the end of the episode
00:45:08 I remember that I fucking lost my shit comedic timing. It's timing that wins
00:45:13 It's just it's just like you can tell these guys like they're not idiots
00:45:17 Even though they're writing something that seems like silly
00:45:21 Because through the entire episode Finn just has a pocket drawn on his shirt
00:45:24 And they don't address why at all until right at the very end and like you're wondering in the back of your mind
00:45:29 Like is that there's like a new detail on his costume they're doing now like he just has a pocket on the shirt
00:45:33 There yeah, it's it's a level of like they on the surface if you're not paying attention
00:45:39 It looks like a dumb kids show where people are just screaming and farting and is laughing and stuff
00:45:43 Yeah, and then if you pay attention there are things that you notice and the show recognizes that and acknowledges that people may be paying
00:45:51 More attention and they say they have like little jokes every so often that are meta in that way to do like it's just it's just really good
00:45:59 To do a little deep analysis of that joke in itself like so a layperson watch the episode like won't even notice that Jake's not there
00:46:07 They'll just say like ah here's Finn and like they if they could have ended the episode without the pocket without the Jake joke
00:46:13 And like it would have been like fine, you know, it would have been like okay
00:46:16 You'd be wondering where Jake is possibly but no one would really question it that much
00:46:19 but by adding that Jake thing it shows that they were in fact thinking of that the whole episode and
00:46:25 Like they they they do in fact address the the issue of why Jake isn't there
00:46:29 But they do it in this obviously absurd way because there was all these incredible
00:46:33 Death-defying things that happened in that episode the Jake would have absolutely
00:46:37 Invaluable to be to participate in and the fact that he just didn't is just like a humorous, you know
00:46:44 Yeah, goo like yeah, they have things that like if you're a pedantic like and why wasn't he helping it's because
00:46:52 He's a stupid dog and sometimes he's just an idiot. That's him. That's him
00:46:56 And I mean and Finn didn't even like ask for his help even though he probably could have used it at several points
00:47:00 But that's fine. It's just such a it's just such a fluid dynamic like re-watching it
00:47:04 You just you're just like your mind boggles at how perfect this the you know the the way they've made the show
00:47:11 For like for like, you know random adventures like anything they want they can do they can make happen because of the way
00:47:19 They've made these characters
00:47:21 Haven't gone back and rewatched adventure time
00:47:23 But I do and this is a little different
00:47:25 But like I have felt just the pangs and I have gone back and watched just bunches of Steven universe
00:47:30 And it's way better to watch on a rewatch because like there's no I know generally what's gonna happen
00:47:35 So I don't need to like stress about this is a waste of an episode
00:47:37 Ah, why aren't the series progressing which are like fine criticisms, but like the vibe of Steven universe
00:47:43 I find incredibly comfy so it is pretty comfy, but you know like in terms of like in terms of like like
00:47:52 The episodes that mean something
00:47:54 Like we I think most people who like Steven universe agree that the the townspeople are not that interesting enough for the time that they're given
00:48:02 Generally, that's true. Yeah
00:48:06 As well like he caused me to quit Steven universe and I only got back to it after
00:48:11 The episode with garnet aired and people were like losing their shit
00:48:14 I like the thing they do with Ronaldo kind of it just the meta because like
00:48:19 Ronaldo has an actual blog in the real world where he like reports on stuff
00:48:23 Yeah, keep keep keep it's like I don't know that's that that's just like Ronaldo in the show that much
00:48:29 But I like what's being done in a meta context
00:48:32 I think the funnest thing with Ronaldo is all the things he says that sounds retarded were actually straight up true
00:48:38 Yes, and you don't but I didn't want to get too much into Steven universe
00:48:41 I just meant to I just brought that up because like I would also like to similarly go back and watch adventure time
00:48:46 Because there was also especially when I heard it was ending and I watched like a video review
00:48:50 I talked about this last week of the of the finale like it gave me such nostalgia and I want to go experience that again
00:48:56 I watched yeah watch like the first two seasons so like I would like to watch the whole thing because yeah
00:49:03 I don't know why I thought I was no idea why I didn't like fall out of like favor with the show didn't do anything to piss me off
00:49:09 Same I got bored. I got watching with one of my friends and like then we stopped hanging out
00:49:13 And so I just stopped watching because I was like the thing we did is we just kick back and like watch that
00:49:18 That makes sense. Oh, yeah, but fuck it. I'm getting back. Give sold me on. I'm gonna check it out as soon as
00:49:26 Like what when I say season one is all killer when I say season one is all killer
00:49:31 No filler it I really mean it like every single episode is just
00:49:35 Muah, you know like muah like the like the you know like sick
00:49:42 Give you say would you say that adventure time style of like comedic delivery had any influence on you?
00:49:48 Cuz like I'm not I think about it things like bail statements
00:49:51 I've kind of have not like an identical tone
00:49:53 But there's there's a little like bits and pieces here in there that have like this. Oh, yeah
00:49:57 Esoteric kind of comedic value to it that I feel very there's some overlap there
00:50:02 I don't know whether I was inspired
00:50:03 I mean, I must have been inspired by it somewhat but I already had a similar sort of style of yeah before
00:50:09 Adventure time and it really resonates with me. So yeah, it's like it's just like that feeling of
00:50:15 Yeah, why not like fucking
00:50:18 Agreed yes, why just why not put a dank weed joke? Yeah. Yeah, this is why not
00:50:26 Even though it will get me thrown in jail for 200 years
00:50:29 Gotta suffer for your heart my favorite thing my favorite thing recently was watching those episodes is that the princesses and how they're all like
00:50:37 They're you know, they're all portrayed as like the dumbest sluts of all
00:50:46 When ice king when ice king shaved his beard and he became the nice king and all the princesses like oh, it's the new nice king
00:50:52 Oh
00:50:55 It was very funny. That's a very make-toe reading
00:51:00 It's just it's just they're so cute and like
00:51:03 They just do like they have dumb voices
00:51:06 If I were to make like my own show like if I had the time or like the budget
00:51:11 I would make it like very simplistic and I would do silly voices and that it would be adventure time
00:51:16 I would that's the show I would make if it's time is a great formula
00:51:21 Yeah, well give the show is ending
00:51:23 I want to know you can pick up the torch and make it make a new version of it do it. I will I'll literally make a show called
00:51:30 Something I probably won't check but someone in the description
00:51:33 Please post a guide to which episodes I should and should skip like I want to I want to comprehensive thing
00:51:40 So now what are the essential episodes? There probably is a list floating out there?
00:51:44 There I bet there is I bet there is did you a sandy wants when I do too I will say
00:51:49 Every episode of season one you have to watch. Okay, Julie noted Julie noted
00:51:54 Every episode season two every episode of season three. I don't know about season four and five
00:52:01 No, because episode season four and five is when I
00:52:05 Stopped but I don't like Tom. I'm not really sure why I didn't hate it
00:52:10 I was just like I think it was like the site
00:52:13 I was watching it on was this really annoying like ads everywhere some of the episodes were missing
00:52:18 You know, it really happens. You really happen to all of us and we're just afraid to admit it
00:52:22 We're ashamed to admit it
00:52:22 We all got into pony and that's all we did when it we threw our lives away and everything else stopped mattering and we all
00:52:29 I think I got into adventure time after
00:52:31 Really mine was I guess I watched I guess I watched season one two as they came out
00:52:35 So I was like way before remember remember that one pony reviewer who was like his O.C. was a pony version of Finn
00:52:42 Oh, yeah, yeah, that was my that guy was an intellectual
00:52:49 What if he's listening right now? I
00:52:52 Got nothing against the guy, but his O.C. was hilarious and silly
00:52:55 I do not like the idea. I have nothing against the guy
00:52:59 But I don't like the idea of taking another character making to it pony and being it
00:53:02 It's kind of son at you ask in its level of thinking like I like this one thing. Let's make this
00:53:08 I mean, he probably was like eight or okay, he probably was like 15 or something
00:53:14 You know, it was me you're probably right
00:53:18 Anyway
00:53:20 Anyone else got another topic. I'm ready to sort of to switch it up
00:53:24 Who of you have dual screens raise your metaphorical? I got dual screen set up right now right now
00:53:31 I
00:53:33 Know what why do you have space on my desk? I don't have I don't have space on my desk
00:53:39 And I don't have space in my room for a bigger desk, and I've always hated people with dual screens
00:53:42 I want to kill everyone. It's good. Oh, no
00:53:45 The reason I asked is because before I went to
00:53:49 Lofiini I got a second monitor and I completely forgot and when I turn was like, oh, I have a second monitor
00:53:54 So they're working with a second monitor and it's just it's like the best
00:53:58 I
00:53:59 Survive without a second monitor. I know I'm gonna level with you guys on dual monitors
00:54:04 All right, so back in the day
00:54:05 I used to my first like big like major desktop display
00:54:08 I had actually bought a 37 inch 1080p TV and that was my computer monitor and it was godlike
00:54:14 And then everyone got on the dual screen set up smoke. All right. I'm gonna I'm gonna switch this up
00:54:18 I'm gonna get two smaller monitors
00:54:20 So I have double the workspace and I hated it
00:54:23 Hated dual monitors because like I only ever worked with one of them
00:54:27 I never spent the time to like shift the windows over because it's like I'm just I'm just I'm looking at this one
00:54:32 And the other one's like kind of off to the side and I don't feel like turning my head. I'm lazy
00:54:36 Fuck it. I want to go back to my one big monitor
00:54:39 But I fixed that problem for me what I have now and this happened by accident is because I got one of those drawing displays
00:54:45 and so instead of having them horizontal I now have it in a vertical alignment and
00:54:50 Vertical is way better because you can see both of them at the same time just by looking forward because I have my 22 inch
00:54:56 Oh, wait, wait, wait, you're saying that you have them mounted above each other
00:54:59 Yeah, so what happens is I have a big 32 inch display now
00:55:02 I just got it's a 32 inch like QHD display and then under it on my desk
00:55:06 I have a 22 inch drawing display and because they're like I can see both of them right now
00:55:12 And I can just drag something down you can just drag it down
00:55:15 So it's on the lower one and it's so much easier to use because like your vision sees both of them
00:55:19 And it's like pure bliss and it's a 10 out of 10. Everybody should do vertical displays. It's way better than horizontal
00:55:27 Technology you're talking about
00:55:30 But I I use it I this is how I use it
00:55:33 But yeah, I wanted a second one just specifically because
00:55:36 When I draw I like to listen or watch things at the site at the corner of my eyes
00:55:42 and that means I cannot full screen my drawing
00:55:46 Program and that gets in the way of me drawing and it's really annoying and like then I have to make the screen of
00:55:53 Whatever I'm watching really tiny that means I don't see it so well
00:55:56 So now that I have the monitors I have like on one monitor what I'm watching and one monitor when I'm drawing and it's so good
00:56:02 I love I love it. It's good
00:56:04 I also end up using my phone for a lot of stuff just because it's convenient to like have that I don't know below
00:56:09 That's all I can do. That's all I can fucking do when I'm streaming
00:56:12 I have to have my phone with the stream chat because I can't do it any other way
00:56:30 So so Tom set up is technically
00:56:33 Like vertical, but it's like on his desk and in front of him give
00:56:36 Why don't you construct Casey Neistat style like get like a a wooden beam going straight up and like make a base
00:56:43 and hang myself from it and
00:56:45 Mount two displays one literally above the other and just like screw it if you want to be lazy
00:56:52 What you do is instead of doing that you can just buy a
00:56:56 Vesum out that basically it attaches to your desk and it has two mounting points in the back for two monitors
00:57:01 So you just take them and there you go on there
00:57:03 Then they're they're one on top of each other so you can just go
00:57:06 Vertical and not have to worry about desk space
00:57:09 Do it give do it
00:57:13 I'm stretching my my neck up right to where the monitor would sit on top of the other one
00:57:19 And it seems like a bit like that that hurts my neck just a bit
00:57:23 I need my friend Matt. He just bought and it's dedicated office space and his setup is transcendent
00:57:30 He has this like big L-shaped desk and he has a huge
00:57:35 27-inch wake-up Sintiq that he got for free and I hate him for it like a
00:57:39 $3,000 Sintiq someone just gave to him and he has that on his left side and that and he has like a big swivel chair
00:57:45 So he wants to draw you just swivels over to that
00:57:47 But when he doesn't need to draw he swivels back over and he has two 27 inch monitors with that
00:57:53 Vertical vase amounts with like that like rotate and swivel and everything so you can adjust both of them to any angle you want
00:58:00 And it's like literally you know god-tier
00:58:03 It's amazing because I just went to see him this week on Friday
00:58:07 I drove to New York and hung out with him and got drunk
00:58:09 We did a podcast, but I just saw this space and I was like I'd never want to leave here like this is perfect
00:58:14 like this is the best setup of all time and
00:58:17 I almost murdered him and stole his office because it was so good
00:58:21 Do you think do you think the the natural progression of stuff like this is eventually we're gonna be like, you know
00:58:28 You got like a sphere with a hole in it. You poke your head in the screen is the sphere the whole way around
00:58:34 Yes, it needs to happen immediately. Yeah, I suppose like the the logical extension is just like
00:58:40 Like augmented reality stuff where like you just put a little lens. You can already do that
00:58:45 You guys know about the Microsoft Holo lens. Have you ever heard about this?
00:58:49 I've heard the name. What is it?
00:58:52 Microsoft's like they have this thing where you put on a pair of like glasses and
00:58:56 It's tapped into like they have ones that plug into a computer
00:59:00 But they also have one that's just the computers built into the headset and how it works is that it overlays digital information
00:59:06 On top of the real world. So like they're like, oh, you want like you can play Pokemon go
00:59:10 Yeah, but it's like over your eyes and they actually had a demo very similar
00:59:13 But one of the things they did like oh you want to like
00:59:15 Because it senses where your hands and stuff are too so they had a demo where it's like oh
00:59:20 I want to watch a movie so they just sat down on a couch took two hands up and spread their hands across the wall
00:59:25 And it made a huge display that was the size the entire wall
00:59:27 I started watching a movie and then they could bring up like a little Skype window on the side that was like
00:59:31 I had like a 45 degree angle like based on where you were sitting that like had Skype
00:59:35 You could just use your hand to scroll through it and stuff while you were watching this big movie
00:59:38 And I was like that was like the big come. I was like, that's what I want. That's yeah
00:59:44 That's what I want fucking fucking Skype back
00:59:47 Yeah
00:59:50 But what you won't get any dank like gamer like login messages when you log into Skype unlike discord
00:59:56 That's what holds this thing to get
00:59:59 God
01:00:01 It was supposed to be our sign. It's just it's just such a millennial program with their login messages
01:00:07 Yeah, and I know that like they do a thing where they said submitted by so-and-so like they take like community ones
01:00:13 That's what they they give you the name so it's like if this one really bothers you, you know who to kill
01:00:27 I do think of you every time that one comes out exactly
01:00:31 Discord stop that please
01:00:33 Fucking hearthstone
01:00:36 Uh
01:00:37 mage what was
01:00:39 Everybody to bring it has to bring a topic forward for the for the topic list formless episodes. Do you have one?
01:00:44 I just did dual screens. Was it your screen? Oh dang. I guess I forgot
01:00:51 After you said it. Are you trying? I'm trying to catch one. I support this Gestapo tactics of calling everyone out to make sure they actually
01:00:58 I have another topic I can bring
01:01:00 Because at the controller owners when they came up last minute
01:01:03 I this is something that I've been wondering about and this is gonna get a little more like
01:01:07 Complicated, I guess and just like person what I wanted to ask is why do you think people don't own their weirdness anymore?
01:01:14 And a lot of explain what I mean by that. It's like yeah back in the day like like in like the early
01:01:21 2000s and shit like people were like really proud of being weird and like war like they've weird internet culture
01:01:27 Like that kind of shit and now it's like like people didn't want to be normal and didn't want to be accepted by society
01:01:35 But now it feels like that has like changed
01:01:37 It's like all of us like grew up and realized like oh, there's actually consequences for not being accepted by greater society now
01:01:42 That we have to be in it because we're adults and now there's like this whole like cultural movement of like
01:01:47 Everything I do needs to be accepted and I can't just be I can't exist on the fringe of culture anymore
01:01:52 My weird lifestyle has to come out of this. I don't know. I still I feel still feel like I'm like weird in the way
01:02:01 I have always been I just you know, I don't I don't say things like
01:02:09 Yeah, I feel like I'm still one with my weakness. I think I feel like this particular group is right
01:02:15 There's definitely pockets of people like us for sure
01:02:18 I mean anyone who listened to this podcast for more than ten minutes realizes
01:02:21 We just don't give a fuck but like I'm talking more like a like a larger cultural scale
01:02:26 Like the internet was just Lalex desorandum now the internet is just accept me
01:02:32 I'm going to change everything to make my weirdness become normal like before it was never like you wanted to be anything
01:02:39 But normal now. It's like everything has to be
01:02:41 I see I see what you mean Tom. I think it's mainly because of the call-out culture
01:02:46 That that's happening and like whenever like you step out of line and like oh, you're a bit egotistic
01:02:51 People start making videos. Oh, this guy is egotistic. Bring him down
01:02:56 Get his head that there's a lot of that. There's a lot of there's a lot of
01:03:02 Laughing at people's it like being slightly not normal and and that being okay
01:03:08 I guess I guess it's it's fueled. It seems to be fueled by teenagers who are like a bit awkward and and don't feel
01:03:15 You know, they're not sure about themselves. So they take it out by laughing at other people who are slightly weird
01:03:21 Yeah, that definitely happens a lot. Yeah
01:03:23 And like that happened back in the day, but like we like accepted that like, you know, you you'd be like, yeah
01:03:28 Of course normies hate me like that's why we say normally like I think this is like post
01:03:33 What's he called leafy's here? I think sort of culture because people got popular by making fun of other people and then other people
01:03:40 They have become popular by renting on other people. So it's the new cool thing to do
01:03:46 You say post game theory. No, no, post leafy leafy post leafy. Oh
01:03:51 I'm personally post game theory
01:03:56 I'm pretty game theory actually I like game theories
01:04:00 Game theory's got his positive points for sure
01:04:02 Um, I think personally a lot of this comes down to I'm gonna blame it all on the baby boomers personally
01:04:08 At least I'm gonna start I think it goes back to that and I I can't exactly trace at the moment the cause of why but I do feel
01:04:16 Like the baby boomers were quite helicopter-ish in their parenting
01:04:21 And you know, I don't even really blame them. I just blame the the world as it's changed into because it's like
01:04:28 I think that a lot that's happened is that like like baby boomers grew up in like the 60s in the 70s and
01:04:35 Like this was the civil rights time and they felt really
01:04:39 I don't know like they wanted to change the world and like make everything about like the individual
01:04:44 And they didn't like their parents who like fought in World War two and were very like I don't know like, you know
01:04:50 Blah blah blah give up shit for your nation, you know
01:04:53 Like the baby boomers are way more
01:04:55 Individualistic the first the generation I think that really
01:04:59 Took off and like there's a lot of good points to that
01:05:01 But I think the negatives is that people became very like when I say self self-obsessed
01:05:06 I don't mean that like they really cared about themselves
01:05:09 I mean that they valued the individual like so much more to the collective
01:05:13 But I think there's a feeling that like it's totally okay to let the collective burn
01:05:18 Just for for any infringement
01:05:20 Against an individual and I feel like the result of this has been that like they raised their kids in an environment
01:05:26 We're like any infraction was too much of an infraction
01:05:29 so like
01:05:31 Calling someone like a faggot on the schoolyard like has become a federal issue like a hate crime and like like I get it like
01:05:38 Okay, you could you could say that that's a hate crime like why are you like?
01:05:43 What's the reason to like
01:05:44 Call this person like a specific demographic, you know
01:05:47 Association that has a negative connotation in some circles like sure sounds like you just hate gay people
01:05:52 But you know the thing is a lot of people just use that word without any association to any group
01:05:57 So like maybe it'd be good to just kind of relax and and realize that this is more kids being kids than
01:06:04 You know like an actual group being attacked for their identity
01:06:07 The thing is with insults most people don't realize when someone is like shoots an insult at you
01:06:14 They usually try to get you where it hurts
01:06:16 So they use whatever you know, they perceive to be your weakness for instance like just a little hogan just these video about
01:06:24 The black guy who fucked his daughter who he really hated so we called him a very nasty term for an african-american individual
01:06:30 You cut out, but I'm not sure I want to hear that all over again. That's fine. Go ahead. Go ahead
01:06:35 But yeah, like for instance, you know someone on the
01:06:39 PCP like if they don't like me they're gonna like I don't know like call me the girl or use some sort of feminine insults that are usually
01:06:47 Yeah, aim that girl's just to sort of like insult me
01:06:50 They might not be misogynistic, but they think that's with how they're gonna get me. I personally don't care
01:06:56 So go ahead, but yeah, yeah, so like it's not about like if I call you sometimes people are definitely
01:07:02 Does that make me like that
01:07:05 The thing is it really involves what's going on in the person's head
01:07:08 Because if I call you a bitch because I just hate all women and here I am
01:07:12 Ah, here's a woman. Let's call her a bitch because I hate her like okay fair enough, but you can also use that word
01:07:17 To just mean like in particular girl
01:07:20 I don't like or you can mean it to say like actually like friend who I'm currently giving a rough attitude to so
01:07:27 And you can also honestly aim it at guys, but then the meaning is gonna be different
01:07:32 But yeah, yeah, like it's it's very much dependent on the person itself and like they might not necessarily be
01:07:40 Misogynistic or or just you know, whatever
01:07:43 Whatever aces do you give them is just that they're trying to be as offensive as possible is to hurt you
01:07:50 so that's not good, but like
01:07:53 People don't need to go to jail for saying a word
01:07:55 I think some people would respond to this and I would understand why and they'd be like
01:07:59 Well, if you choose to use that word anyway, despite knowing the context then that makes you, you know, whatever the particular thing is
01:08:08 You make the word so horrible, that's why people like to use it because it's such a horrible word
01:08:15 Yeah, I mean, that's definitely true, but like you words have the power you decide to give them
01:08:20 Yeah, that's true. And like I do not blame people for getting mad about words that they find offensive
01:08:26 But like I don't know. I just your problem like I mean, yeah, I mean it kind of is your problem and
01:08:32 But you know like we want to bridge gaps here
01:08:35 We don't want to say like if you can't take it
01:08:36 You're just like a pussy and then here we are just labeling you and throwing your opinion aside
01:08:40 What you'd want to do is like kind of like have a conversation with this person as to why you disagree
01:08:45 And we we've certainly made this argument quite a few times on this podcast
01:08:49 Happy to have like discussions with people that disagree with me
01:08:53 Yeah, as you do in the comments all the time on these and these podcasts
01:08:57 Yeah, yeah, yeah
01:08:59 Yeah, like I personally don't swear too much other than like the usual shouldn't fuck because those I don't even consider them
01:09:05 swear words at this point
01:09:11 Just like you're being raised like you can't say swears. They're bad. I just like what the fuck you talk about, you know
01:09:17 So some people fuck is the worst word you can say but like to us. It's basically completely meaningless
01:09:23 Take the words gay at some point. It was like quite offensive or just like, you know
01:09:29 Like you wouldn't sold someone by calling them gay
01:09:31 But nowadays like no one really cares anymore. You call each other gay like you guys call each
01:09:39 But at the same time like I went for the most part like
01:09:43 Of course by Hilary
01:09:45 But only from what I've observed like most people don't care anymore. I mean some people do but like you're the most parts
01:09:51 No one cares. It's definitely that like nowadays things like gay becoming like way more
01:09:58 Offensive nowadays is because of a very very vocal minority of people who are trying to get offended at
01:10:04 They're giving back the power to the word
01:10:07 Yeah, I know I feel empathy like let's say that like if you're gay and like you go to school every day and like people call
01:10:14 You gay because they just hate that you are homosexual like I took like I of course I understand like yeah
01:10:20 You're not gonna be too fond of that word and you're not going to enjoy it
01:10:23 But more important than banning the word is like making people okay with the thing because like they're gonna find another word to
01:10:29 Call him if they're gonna get if they're gonna get thrown in jail for saying gay
01:10:32 They're gonna find another way to make fun. It's not that hard culture just make up new insult
01:10:37 So I can it's gonna be difficult to stay ahead of that curve
01:10:39 You know, you can't just ban everything English English has enough words to sustain insults for like
01:10:45 I don't believe in that top-down approach as an effective way to like change people's minds
01:10:50 I mean, I'd like to I'd like to imagine that being like gayness has become more
01:10:57 accepted in in schools and stuff I have no idea to
01:11:01 Whether or not that's the case because only I only have the Internet
01:11:05 Yeah
01:11:07 But you know like I
01:11:10 Used to be a bit more like
01:11:12 not
01:11:13 Bigoted I guess but like it grossed me out
01:11:17 Grossed me out when I was younger because it was like what why would you kiss a guy? That's not true
01:11:23 I mean, I still find it pretty strange because like I it's not something that I want to do
01:11:27 But like it's nowadays, you know, somebody says they're gay for real not joking
01:11:34 And then you're like, okay, like it's it's no longer a big deal because yeah, like
01:11:41 You know the social justice warrior
01:11:44 Angle of like lots of shows and things people get upset and they can fight like like social justice warrior hate
01:11:52 Brigades like going around trying to get people censored and then things just appeasing that crowd
01:11:57 As the same I think yeah, you know things that are making gayness
01:12:02 More like normal and having gay characters. That's okay
01:12:05 That's actually good because it makes it so that people growing up don't find it as weird
01:12:11 Yeah, the the the Haprigays are separate, but like people conflate the tune
01:12:15 I don't like I don't like it when somebody sees like a
01:12:18 Like a gay character in a thing and they assume that it's social justice warrior crap and therefore
01:12:24 It's it's terrible to have gay characters because that's completely going against the
01:12:30 Like it should be okay. It should be okay to have one or the other
01:12:33 Yeah, yeah, I don't I don't like like people like high guardian spice, right high guardian spice comes out and it's like very
01:12:40 social justice warrior
01:12:42 Like appealing like it's dog whistling to the
01:12:46 It's it's it's got it's got all that that funny stuff and and it's like I
01:12:52 Don't see a problem with you know
01:12:55 The social justice angle
01:12:57 The the adding the adding of like I mean we don't know anything about the characters of story
01:13:02 But like they're having a lot of female writers
01:13:06 Too much for a problem with that specifically, but it's when it's it's just
01:13:12 It's just disingenuous
01:13:15 When you say like we are gonna have 100% all female writers in this and then if there happens to be a writer's room of all men
01:13:23 That's a problem. That's yeah, then then I get like whoa
01:13:28 Even universe like we all enjoy the show to some extent, right?
01:13:32 And it does have like those sort of people working on it
01:13:36 Like you know bit of ACW's bit of feminists, but like they don't shove it down, you know our throats there
01:13:42 Whatever beliefs they're making a genuine interesting show with whatever
01:13:46 Yeah, that's that's what I was trying to get at like even if even if
01:13:50 It's it's not the fact that it's a room of a hundred percent female writers
01:13:54 It's that they advertise it as that being itself a good thing
01:13:58 And there's no reason to believe that that means the show will be good. It just depends on how
01:14:04 So like if if if high garden spice just came out and it was like that's a pretty good show and it's got a hundred percent female
01:14:10 Wouldn't give a shit
01:14:12 Those those writers are good writers and that's just a good thing
01:14:15 I just hate that we live in a world and like this just is the real world and I get it
01:14:18 I think we'll never change
01:14:19 But like I want it to be that a product just gets made and then everyone just sees if it's good or not
01:14:24 And we don't worry about anything involved in how it was made or any like whatever like I guess if they it was made
01:14:30 Using the blood of babies because they ground them up and turn them into scripts. I mean, I guess that's
01:14:34 I don't know what the show's good enough. I don't think I care. I mean
01:14:40 Alchemist was made by a female author. Yeah sure was sure was yeah, and look look how popular that is only with women
01:14:47 No guys ever liked full metal alchemist
01:14:51 You know was weird though as I was reading through full metal alchemist
01:14:55 Strangely when I as soon as I found out it was written by a woman the next chapter and all subsequent chapters became shit
01:15:01 Oh, so when I reread the old chapter, they were also suddenly bad was a big it was weird
01:15:05 It was weird, but I haven't re-read it since I found out so I guess I guess don't do it
01:15:11 So that strikes me as weird like winery. Yeah, I don't know what's funny though
01:15:16 She's so violent and it's played off as comedic effect. I never liked that in anime
01:15:19 That's why I don't like Doridora much either punching guy through wall just and don't do not
01:15:25 Yeah, I mean I
01:15:29 Speaking related tangentially to the thing Nate said at the very beginning about like
01:15:35 Blaming the boomers. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you say that I think this is a like
01:15:39 I'm really tired of of Millennials blaming the boomers like the way boomers blame the Millennials
01:15:45 Not because anyone is like incorrect like I'm I think what you said was
01:15:50 Okay, I think what you said was correct and all that but like it's just it feels so cowardly that
01:15:57 Every millennial whoever disparages baby boomers and you know the things they've done never says it to their face
01:16:03 They say it on the internet a place. They would never find it
01:16:07 We never actually
01:16:09 Now get my dad in here munchie. Can we just can we pull up my dad, please in the phone? Yeah, okay
01:16:13 All right, dad fuck like like none of us would go like I can't call my grandpa and is like little model airplane
01:16:19 Say grandpa you fucked up the world
01:16:22 Like I can't say that to him. I'd be too embarrassed. I'd be too scared like oh, he's just not mad now
01:16:27 It doesn't matter. I feel like this is a very sort of American thing to do
01:16:31 Hmm, I just I don't
01:16:35 I cannot see I cannot see blaming my parents or my grandparents for whatever would happen because of the history my country
01:16:41 You know once well, I mean you can fact you factually blame your parents for 100% of the experiences
01:16:47 You've had in your life because they are in fact. Yeah, that's like I don't I don't have the hatred for baby boomers
01:16:54 That a lot of people seem to do the problem is that like so many people who blame the boomers
01:16:59 I think you can you can point as a cause at a causal thing to certain things like oh
01:17:04 This is x things fault. The problem is that what so many people who do that proceed to then abdicate?
01:17:10 Responsibility for anything that happens going forward and that's where the problem
01:17:14 Yeah, so what I would never like like the boomers cause problems
01:17:18 What are you going to do to fix it because complaining about it is not gonna help?
01:17:24 Yeah, but as much as it is unfair that they have put you in this situation
01:17:27 There's nothing you can do, but what you try and get out of it
01:17:30 Yeah, yeah, the reason the reason I said is it feels like American thing because like whenever they you know
01:17:34 They talk about the problems the boomers caused it seems like it's happened in America's like very American centric the problems are like
01:17:42 American history this happen
01:17:45 American history echoes throughout the whole world
01:17:47 So, you know, it's not necessarily just America, but it's still it still very feels like the people who post those are
01:17:55 Does the term baby boomer wouldn't that specifically apply to it an American generation like those economic conditions
01:18:02 America at the time is what caused the whole big thing in the first place
01:18:06 Oh, by the way, by the way, we're talking baby boomers are not the same as boomers because boomers are
01:18:12 30 year old
01:18:14 American gamers who are distinct from the zoomers who are the current like I don't know
01:18:20 12 to 20 year old American
01:18:27 Enough of these stupid names that sound too similar to other the stupid names
01:18:33 Kill all boomers and zoomers
01:18:35 But just kill everyone
01:18:38 Genocide
01:18:41 May the meteor hit the earth right now
01:18:45 I'm cussing me right now from Final Fantasy 7
01:18:52 Well, I don't know are we are we good with this topic I feel pretty comfortable going over to the to the
01:18:59 Different direction I was expecting I did not expect a social justice rant to come out of that
01:19:03 But that's that's fine. You know, yeah
01:19:05 Let me just finish the point on the actual thing because your original point was just about like why are people well?
01:19:11 What was why do people why do people not own their weirdness anymore?
01:19:15 Why are we pushing more towards acceptance everything as opposed to being like? Yeah, I'm proud to be hated by normal people. I
01:19:21 Mean, I like my response to that was like I feel like it's because we've made it so that people feel
01:19:28 Like people are less able to feel vulnerable and be okay with it
01:19:32 So like they're less willing to accept criticism and less willing to feel like they don't belong
01:19:37 I think like there's a lack of resilience. I feel in
01:19:42 Less conversations going on and more gotcha exposed you moments on that's that's that's a fair assessment
01:19:48 I'd say you like you can post something now
01:19:52 And like I don't know
01:19:53 I mean, you know, maybe this is a bad example
01:19:55 But it's like if you post something online then like way later
01:19:58 Someone can just use it like to get you because they take it way out of context because like everything's available online
01:20:04 Nothing is everything's like documented and able to be sorted through and like if you ever get to a position of like of
01:20:10 Prominence like people can dig through your old posts and like make a federal fucking case of like a tiny joke
01:20:17 You made yeah, I nobody had a problem with but now I
01:20:21 Hate the I hate that and I relish
01:20:24 I would I relish and dream of a day when I am at a an area of prominence and somebody tries to dethrone me by
01:20:31 Digging up my old tweets where I say the n-word a million times and then and I'm not gonna delete them and I'm gonna say
01:20:38 F you and I'm gonna turn my back on them. I'm not gonna do anything. I'm not gonna apologize
01:20:42 I'm not gonna say I'm not even if I get fired or from whatever it is
01:20:46 I I just don't I don't ever want to acquiesce to that stupid shit on a certain example
01:20:51 I do worry that in that situation
01:20:53 I'll I'll buckle because like I to feel like I'm not trying to say that you're just like acting tough or whatever
01:20:59 But I like I feel like I don't want to apologize either, but then like I wonder if I will push you out in that moment
01:21:06 It's like it's it's it's a thing of principle for me like it
01:21:10 Even if it's a stupid thing to do
01:21:12 Mm-hmm
01:21:12 I just don't want to ever let anyone who follows me or knows about me or here's about it on the news yeah to think
01:21:20 That because I know loads of people feel the way I do and they just they wish somebody would just say no
01:21:27 Correct, which is the to this to this mob of political correctness like whether or not it's a good thing to do
01:21:34 I just I wish you know what I don't wish it happens to me, but if it happens to me
01:21:37 I'm going to do that. I'm going to say no no way. I'll take a stand right here like ethically
01:21:42 I absolutely think there's a time and place to say the worst racial or other kind of slur that there is there's
01:21:50 100% a time and place when it's gonna be really fucking funny and
01:21:54 Totally awesome to say and everyone will laugh and have a great time as a result of it
01:21:58 So and that extends to every word and every possible thing
01:22:01 And like you could then if you just take that out of context like oh look at this evil person
01:22:07 Did this thing and it was like bad because they said a word that they're forbidden to say
01:22:12 My thing was because I think about this a lot too because I I mean I keep up with the news and shit
01:22:17 And like people getting fucking destroyed for for things
01:22:19 They've said that are innocuous that have become bad and my my whole thing is again
01:22:23 Cuz I've always felt like what if that ever happened to me and my thing is that I would not apologize
01:22:27 And I would not be tempted to simply because the people who are trying to take me down for this
01:22:33 I don't respect them and like nothing no apology at the damage has been done. No apology
01:22:39 I would say what would matter
01:22:42 The problem I'm not interested in their forgiveness anyway because I already hate them
01:22:45 I hear what you're saying the problem isn't those people and like those people are probably know what they're doing is wrong
01:22:50 But but like what worries me when I think about it is but there's tons of people out there who simply like
01:22:57 Accept what is reported like in a headline
01:23:00 Like so-and-so is racist and they will not read the article
01:23:03 They will not do the research to know that it's a bunk and that's okay
01:23:07 So you apologize has anyone who's ever apologized ever gotten a follow-up report be like actually this guy's not a racist
01:23:13 He said sorry like the damage is done. Unlike. There's no apologies. Yeah, even if that even if they report on that
01:23:20 It won't matter because the people won't say you're already people see a headline people see a headline that says so
01:23:27 Prominent person is secretly a Nazi and it's like ooh interesting
01:23:31 I wonder how this person was disgraced and then you've got a same headline
01:23:34 Prominent person is secretly okay, and they just glaze over it because people like they love to see like tragic downfalls
01:23:43 Here's another that's why that stuff so like like anybody who's been accused of rape and is exonerated
01:23:49 It doesn't matter. They're still a rapist to those people
01:23:52 It doesn't nothing you're ever gonna do or say will ever change those people's minds because they they because at that point the people who are
01:23:58 Looking for people who are racist and sexist and bigoted or whatever
01:24:01 You are an our ammo in there like they're gone, right?
01:24:05 Because they're trying to gain more power and change social structure to put them in a better position
01:24:10 So the more people like you that exist the more it's so a situation to pop up and the more ammo they have to change
01:24:18 Social structure to their benefit absolutely true
01:24:21 And did you see the there was a comment by Norm McDonald recently comedian extraordinaire where he um don't know like he said a comment
01:24:29 I forget what the inciting comment was it was something about oh, we know it okay like he said
01:24:34 In like some podcast or something that like he
01:24:38 He of course he felt bad for like people who were like insulted by Rosie O'Donald her you know
01:24:44 You could possibly interpret it as a racist comment
01:24:47 I'm on I'm agnostic to that and then like Louis CK like they both
01:24:51 At Louis CK like you know flashes dick jacked off in front of women, you know, it seems pretty sketchy, but I don't know the details
01:24:58 What what he said about that was like
01:25:00 The what what Louis CK and Roseanne suffered as a result of that like was its own bad thing
01:25:08 And then people said that like okay, but what about the victims and he's like well
01:25:11 I mean yeah, they had their own bad things happen, but that's not what these guys felt so I you know in addition
01:25:17 I specifically feel bad for what happened to Louis and Roseanne and like that's an accurate statement
01:25:23 But they did not suffer the like the kind of social backlash is obviously very different from the specific kind of you know
01:25:30 Suffering such as it is that happened to the people that were you know quote-unquote targeted or attacked by Louis and Roseanne
01:25:37 but
01:25:38 And in respect people got real mad so he apologized about that and what he said was you would have to have
01:25:44 Down syndrome to not feel bad for the victims and I think that is like I mean sure that's I guess kind of mean
01:25:51 I guess
01:25:53 And then he apologized for that as well and he was apologizing for his apology
01:25:58 Ridiculous like there's the thing is like he just he just said nothing
01:26:04 It's impossible. Yeah, I
01:26:06 Don't know too much about Norma doll, but I have seen a few of you know funny things he's done
01:26:12 He seems like the sort of person who would have deliberately made that down syndrome joke in his apology because he doesn't like apologizing
01:26:21 And then he and then he went back on that and I'm like, yeah
01:26:25 No, yeah, I like the down syndrome apology if he just didn't apologize for that because that's like funny and it's own
01:26:32 You know, hey, I mean, I'm sorry. You're fucking stupid. That's a good apology. Yeah, it's really interesting
01:26:38 There's no way to win there. There is no way to win. It's interesting because like I just I'm like a huge
01:26:42 Audible fan like audio books and I just started listening to a book. I've always wanted to read unless you call the 48 laws of power
01:26:49 It's incredibly insightful. I love it. I'm almost done with it
01:26:52 And I'm probably gonna like listen slash read it again immediately because it's like trock full of goodness
01:26:57 But the introduction to the 48 laws of power is
01:27:01 Basically this big kind of like essay all about like how power is used and like how to look out for people who are you who are really
01:27:08 Effective at using power despite not seeming as such and this entire essay is literally just disgusting social justice warriors
01:27:16 Like if you ever wanted just like they're like, oh, of course
01:27:19 I'm like, I already kind of knew that going in but just hearing it after affirmed in a
01:27:23 Subject matter that's talking nothing about SJWs and trying to like be submerged them
01:27:28 Like just listen to the introduction of 48 laws of power. You're gonna be like, oh
01:27:32 Yeah, I am not saying I am not saying that the social justice movement is like
01:27:38 Deliberately designed and the people in it are consciously attempting to undermine
01:27:43 Society but what I am saying is if there were a force that was trying to covertly upend the Western society
01:27:51 This is what it would look like. I think there's a I'm just saying I'm just saying
01:27:56 Contention of people hiding behind the social justice movement to do that
01:28:00 It wouldn't be so unsurprising. It would not be unsurprising and the way that we've like just for example
01:28:06 We've basically labeled all women who claim anything as like in the social justice circles
01:28:11 Any woman who makes an accusation must be believed in some circles like wow, what an amazing tool
01:28:16 We've given to any evil women out there. This is incredible
01:28:19 They could they can really use that and this bullshit about no one would ever claim anything if it wasn't true
01:28:24 No, get that out of my face. I don't give a fuck. That's a shitty argument. There's tons of reasons why you would
01:28:29 So yeah, I just don't believe in giving tools that could be abused to anyone
01:28:34 I want everyone to be on the same playing field, but you know what whatever I'm getting all wound up about this
01:28:38 We all know the score here
01:28:40 Anyways weird
01:28:42 Let's let's come around a voicemail now that we've gone down that right. It's weird. Yeah, let's get into some truth
01:28:47 I guess some people who aren't afraid to share their weirdness with the world
01:28:51 our listeners
01:28:54 Absolutely, and let's see first up on the chopping block. We've got a voice message here from pig word pig word the friendly pig
01:29:04 What have you got for us friend go?
01:29:07 Then it's the fucking Ghibli cast gonna get to fucking pork a row sir
01:29:13 Oh, that is my shit. The only reason I watch Ghibli fucking pigs for life suck my dick
01:29:23 Well, okay, that's all right
01:29:26 I'm on the Ghibli cast as well. Oh, yeah, of course. I forgot that's a game show as well
01:29:31 so like I
01:29:32 watched pork a row sir like weeks ago and I
01:29:36 Think it's just
01:29:37 Everyone forgot no wait did you was doing like his month of videos at the next one. Is that next on the block?
01:29:42 I think it's next. Okay. I think it's next so so I just need to remind digi and set a date and say digi digi digi digi digi
01:29:49 Digi and and devu as well. Maybe I don't know what's going on with the view. I haven't heard it from him in a while
01:29:54 So which we're just gonna message them, but I do want to do that because that is a really good film
01:29:59 Yeah, it's probably my favorite Ghibli after watching it
01:30:01 Man, that's what I really wanted to jump in on and watch it with you guys, but I just don't fucking time
01:30:06 I gotta do other shit
01:30:08 Like watch and bully. Yeah, that's right. Oh, that's that's a little teaser for everybody. Yeah. All right
01:30:15 Next one. This is from your boy has a message for us. Let's hear it. All right. Hey fuckers
01:30:21 Just wanted to tell you I love you. Yeah, you're all my role models. Thanks. You'll suck
01:30:28 No, my question is why do I not have any friends?
01:30:36 Yeah, if you approach your your potential friends with like I love you you're great
01:30:40 No guys, I don't see any flaws in his approach. I think this really I I can't figure out
01:30:48 Just keep doing what you're doing, man, you'll find somebody eventually
01:30:51 I think I think your biggest problem is that we are your role models
01:30:56 That's an issue and I think you might be coming on a little too positively you got to nag a little bit more when you're no
01:31:02 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you got it
01:31:05 You got to become good friends by being nice and then you can you can nag on people
01:31:08 I mean, that's that's generally true
01:31:10 The way you become friends is just to be like nice to them and then it's weird for a little bit
01:31:15 But then it's cool. You can hang out with us
01:31:17 You're all right, and then it becomes a thing like you want to go to a house and play Splatoon or smash
01:31:25 And then and then after a couple months after a couple months you can call them cunts all day
01:31:29 Yeah, that's true. This is how you get a girlfriend that you you say hey
01:31:33 Do you want to play smash not telling her that secretly what you're thinking of is?
01:31:37 And then she's given a verbal contract allowing you to do whatever you want sure once you smuggled in your own
01:31:43 That's how you do
01:31:47 Video games are you sent hashtag there it is
01:31:50 All right, here's one from Ronary Mishin Mishin welcome. What do you got? I?
01:31:57 Haven't talked to anyone in like over a week
01:31:59 So I'm wondering how long have you guys spent not talking to anyone ever in person talking to or like online
01:32:08 I guess he means in person has to be in person. I'm guessing just talk to us technically
01:32:12 So if that if it's online counts, you just broke his streak. Yeah, we reset the counter there reset the counter
01:32:18 I mean, I don't know. I probably have not gone a single day in my life without you know what now that I think about it in
01:32:25 College I think there were some days that I didn't talk to anyone
01:32:30 Yeah, I think the most has been like a weekend the longest I've ever been cuz like at uni
01:32:36 I would stay in my room and I I didn't really like my housemates and they didn't really like me, but it wasn't because
01:32:42 Like we had any animosity it was just like it was awkward the first time we met and it didn't stop being awkward
01:32:48 So it's just all I
01:32:50 Didn't but but I I would talk to I had friends at uni who are different and I would talk to them
01:32:57 But when it was the weekends, I didn't need to go in and so sometimes I would just sit at home playing video game
01:33:02 And and making pony reviews. Oh, yeah, that was that sort of time
01:33:06 Live with someone so I couldn't avoid the
01:33:10 You know the good morning sort of interactions, but if we discount those the mandatory interactions, yeah family members
01:33:18 Like I'm not talking like I didn't even have like proper conversations. It's like good morning
01:33:22 Hi and back sort of those things then probably like a few weeks. Maybe at some point
01:33:28 That's pretty long. Yeah
01:33:31 I went a few weeks in college because like what happened in college for me is that I was like dating my girlfriend at the time
01:33:36 And then we broke up and then all my other friends. I knew I knew through her
01:33:40 So I didn't want to talk to any of them and I actually I've lived on campus at the time
01:33:46 And I happened to be in horseman hall at my college and that was horse horse hall
01:33:52 And and this this was the only dorm on campus. I had single room dorms
01:33:57 So I lived on campus with no roommates at all
01:34:01 So for like two or three weeks at a time, I would just talk to no one and it was fucking sick
01:34:09 No one but the whores here in a man hall was it was there not even like classes you went to I had no friends
01:34:16 I didn't need to talk to them
01:34:18 So because this is like senior year
01:34:20 So I was just doing like senior portfolio and stuff and like no one talked to anybody doing senior portfolio because we were all like
01:34:25 About to die. So we had to do this entire big portfolio piece and get an art project ready for
01:34:29 The show we did at the end of the year, which I didn't find out because I didn't talk to anybody that it was actually mandatory
01:34:35 So like I don't care about doing stuff for a portfolio like a senior show to see like three people including my parents
01:34:40 I make things on the internet and they're like, no, no, this is like 40% of your grade. I'm like, oh
01:34:44 And oh, it's doing three days. I guess I should probably do something
01:34:48 Damn, did you get it done? I just took something I was doing on the internet just said oh, I was working on this the entire time
01:34:54 I made it work, but uh, no, like I didn't like I very rarely talked to the instructors at the point
01:34:59 I didn't need to and I would just like
01:35:02 Go to class then I would sleep during the day then it'd be up all night
01:35:05 I'd walk around the campus when no one else was awake at like 3 a.m. And it was fucking sick
01:35:10 Well, that's dope. I would say though
01:35:12 I feel like Mages situation is probably relatively common of people like who don't have any meaningful interactions day to day
01:35:20 And that's really sad. I would say
01:35:22 He didn't I would say fix this if your life is like this
01:35:26 It's not ideal and you're probably harming your mental health
01:35:29 It is as sick as it was it is better to have interactions with people
01:35:35 It's um, yeah, yeah, I am very lucky to have like brothers
01:35:40 Yeah, who are cool because we talk quite a lot like we often go on Pokemon me and
01:35:46 Hgb guy go and Pokemon walks together and we you know if we had something that was on our mind
01:35:52 We can talk about it while we're walking in Pokemon and it's like that's a really nice like very like not occasional like
01:36:00 Regular like deep conversation in real life, and that's that's nice. Yeah, that's good
01:36:04 It's good to have stuff like that if you can but if you ain't got brothers got to go go join a club
01:36:09 And I mean that sincerely I met a lot of great people through my anime club not a joke
01:36:14 Surprising like you might think you're fine, you know not interacting with people
01:36:18 But then you actually interact with people and you feel so much better about it
01:36:22 Swallow your special snowflake-ness and recognize that you are a base lowly human animal and humans are pack animals
01:36:28 And you'll be doing yourself a favor if you associate with you other humans life life is the sins
01:36:34 Yeah, you your social media goes down and then you cry
01:36:43 Alright, well that should be enough for him. Here's one from a house of Claude another message
01:36:48 Hi, I was in the sophomore year of high school
01:36:51 Well, I was an improv and improv club
01:36:54 We were playing a game called props if we don't know what it is you take an object and pretend
01:36:59 It's other things we ran out of props and
01:37:03 One of the girls said can I be a prop and I said impulsively all women are props
01:37:14 Water
01:37:16 He finishes he's drinking 95% of a liter of water right now
01:37:22 Wow, what a power move. Oh, yeah
01:37:30 No, he's gonna do it. He's gonna do it
01:37:32 I hate it. I hate this. There you go. Oh my god. Oh god. What a god. I just want to oh
01:37:43 That was nice
01:37:50 That was a good story. I liked it. It was a pretty good story
01:37:53 I
01:37:55 Kind of wish we weren't laughing immediately after he said that he called all women's props
01:37:59 Because I wanted to know what they responded with no, they didn't respond with anything. He simply replied
01:38:04 I'm going to drink 95% of a liter of water now. He did not okay. No, he didn't I'm telling you. I'm telling you
01:38:11 I was into it. Oh my god. I
01:38:14 Was not ready for some like weird like creepy incel comment, but no he fucking red-pilled the shit out of that
01:38:23 Well, I think we all pretty much that guy I mean the moral of the story
01:38:30 Clearly he's yeah, indeed. Here's one from a Tomasso Tomasso choco taco
01:38:38 Okay, all right driving through South Carolina. I found a place called a shit. You not cuckold landing
01:38:44 I just thought I should let y'all know just in case y'all don't have the location of PCPHQ locked in
01:38:50 I
01:38:55 Was gonna say it but then he said it cuckold's landing in South Carolina
01:39:01 PCPHQ southern division. I'm already on the plane. I'm already on the plane
01:39:11 Because it'll be a endless bounty of women available to fuck at all times because we will be the guys
01:39:17 We fuck all the cuckolds women
01:39:21 Yeah, I got I hope so here we go. He's one of David Bowie this one
01:39:28 Let's see what he's got for us
01:39:50 Question for a specific member of the PCP they might not be on that episode
01:39:54 So you might just be calling it for no reason and then the other members would have to answer for them
01:39:57 Which wouldn't give you a specifically satisfying answer for what you wanted to ask them
01:40:08 I like that one David
01:40:11 That that very true and very good very boy. Yeah, that was very yeah
01:40:16 It
01:40:18 Yeah, what it what was what are we supposed to do when somebody isn't on the episode and somebody wants a question for a specific member
01:40:26 You know at the member and then the reply in the comments on the episode. Well, you should do if you should do
01:40:31 Here's here's a solution if you have a question specifically for one of the members
01:40:35 You should start the voicemail with this is directed towards so we can if we hear it
01:40:41 We're for screening questions. We can know not to use that one if they're not on the episode
01:40:46 Yes, I generally that is a good thing
01:40:48 It's just like because the the PCB format is such that anyone could be there or not be there every single time
01:40:55 So there's no way to know
01:40:56 So, I mean the the flaw is just we screen them a little bit. I screen them really
01:41:01 I'm just gonna try to dump ones that don't use you know that person if they're not here. That's it
01:41:07 That's all we can do, you know, what else? What else is there to say about it?
01:41:11 All right, here's another one from a formal one spar. He's got another one for us
01:41:16 What's up?
01:41:18 Hello, you have a collect call from clear view mediocre security mental war
01:41:24 I'll take listen. There's no time. All right. I only had 24 cents for this non-net neutrality protected connection
01:41:29 All right, look, I'm not crazy. I need these timestamps to prove the conspiracy
01:41:34 There's a connection here that you're not seeing they haven't found out yet
01:41:37 I can still access my channel from the iPads in the rec room. I need time to have by October 15th
01:41:42 Time has expired. Thank you. Goodbye
01:41:46 Okay, good stuff. What's bar needs those Starfleet timestamps, right? That this is good. This is you see guys. He put
01:41:54 Just, you know, I like this. Yeah, he noticed that his his previous calls were being talked over because they were boring
01:42:00 And then he made them more interesting. That's very good. This is what we want. Good job
01:42:03 This is what we want. He deserves those timestamps. Yeah
01:42:09 And he's on his channel is like once bar weekly, I think and what's his uh, he's looking he's it was it it is Starfleet
01:42:14 Yes, all right anytime
01:42:17 From all PCB episodes send them to to one spar. He's probably on one spar Twitter. You can find them. I'm sure
01:42:23 But yeah, there's I wonder what this there's a connection. We're not seeing guys. What what could it be?
01:42:27 We need to find well. He is in an insane asylum now. So
01:42:31 Oh, wait
01:42:32 Shit, this may be a flaw in my plan
01:42:36 Here's another one from from Simon. Simon's got another one for us. What's up?
01:42:40 The voicemail's bit is bad
01:42:44 It only works on the dick show because he screens them and he has a high
01:42:50 quality IQ
01:42:53 Production value. Okay. Okay. And oh, but you're using the voicemail bit to say that the voicemail bit is bad
01:43:00 Isn't that contradictory? I hear I hear what you're saying Ben saying
01:43:05 Or whatever fucking
01:43:07 Who cares? This isn't funny. What I'm saying is fuck you. The voicemails are bad. Stop doing them
01:43:13 I just want to hear you guys talk about shit. Fuck off
01:43:15 I think that you are in the minority by not like them. I do it's interesting that if we if we had screened the voicemails
01:43:21 You're even the first one to go
01:43:24 I okay to be to be faith to leave clear
01:43:27 I do in fact screen them in that I listen to at least a portion of them and just decide quickly like okay
01:43:32 Is this one I'm going to show or not like is it we can't say that?
01:43:35 I mean a lot of you are going to bait the first couple seconds something that sounds good
01:43:40 I mean that's a risk we have to take
01:43:43 I mean if
01:43:44 If it like if they're able to make something enticing at the beginning and then deliberately make it shitty
01:43:49 Then it would be a joke and then it would be funny. So I wouldn't mind that I wouldn't mind that either
01:43:53 But you know, I think we are increasing the quality as we go and I think a lot of people like the same
01:43:57 Yeah, these ones have been good, but you picked the right you picked good ones indeed. Well, thank you. Thank you very much
01:44:01 I'm doing a little work on it. Um, all right. Here's one from somebody mage knows
01:44:05 This is from satan father of demons
01:44:08 Um sent in a voicemail

01:45:53 And then I fucking did it and I just ate cream
01:45:56 For days and now I can't leave my fucking house and I'm shouting into this voicemail machine
01:46:02 Into the void
01:46:05 It's all right. We hear you. We hear you
01:46:08 I heard that too
01:46:09 Oh, we'll pass that fuck you on to ben

01:46:16 So I guess candy corn will be available again soon
01:46:19 Oh, that's true. That's true. How are we?
01:46:23 People are already getting into the spook spirit
01:46:27 Guys get ready for fucking
01:46:30 Oh my god. Hey, wait a minute. Gib. I just want to say it would be pretty appropriate if the if the finale of
01:46:37 Of pump a.k.a pump the big spooker dropped on halloween. That would be a pretty incredible
01:46:43 ending wait, wait
01:46:45 Shut up. Oh shit. Wait. I didn't know that was a thing. All right. Well, it's it's it's not actually my secret plan
01:46:50 But it is a very good because that's when she was born. Oh, yeah, that's right
01:46:55 Oh, what was that? Was that tom if it's going to be halloween soon?
01:46:58 Does that mean you're going to be changing your twitter icon to something not halloween related? Is the gag going to continue? Oh, yeah
01:47:04 What's it going to be?
01:47:06 Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm going to change it back to just hypocrite
01:47:10 Will this be one year? I it was like one year of having continuing to have the halloween
01:47:17 Twitter thing which I started in november last year
01:47:20 Right and pump who was born as a result of this, right? I will I will always be halloween except on halloween
01:47:28 Fantastic. Oh, excellent. Um, well, let's switch over to the questions real quick
01:47:32 We'll burn through a couple of these trash low effort, uh, you know questions and uh,
01:47:38 We'll just we'll do that show
01:47:40 Let me just read the pity question here from at noodle bombs
01:47:44 Uh, just ask when will we see the adventure time podcast? That was it just now. Uh, it's over just now
01:47:50 You you just heard it. We did it. We did it. You're welcome. Um, what all right. Well, so that's that what else is going on
01:47:55 Um, anyone looking in the in the main chat. I'll get some from here, but um
01:48:01 There's there's uh, there's not there's not a whole lot of pickings this
01:48:05 Really great. Tell me you posted in patron knowledge. Not the questions. Oh, they posted the wrong chat
01:48:10 Oh, true. That might have been why fair enough the same thing
01:48:13 You fool. There's there's several dream related questions
01:48:17 Oh
01:48:19 Our true nightmares, uh
01:48:21 This dream meme has to end the my dream is that we get no more questions about dreams every dream is to have more dreams
01:48:30 But I can't damn it ever since they cut out my mandula oblongata
01:48:34 um
01:48:35 This isn't a question, but it's in the questions box
01:48:38 Someone should draw all the pcp members as bugs from hollow knight and I agree. That's true. Someone should do that
01:48:43 That would be adorable. I love hollow knight art style and like the little bug bug designs. So that would be great
01:48:49 That would be great. I'm I'm weighing to hollow knight as everyone knows and just did the stream of it
01:48:53 What like two days ago? I remember remember when I drew all of us as like those furry rpg characters
01:48:59 I sure do. I was a spider. So yes, johnny is a spider
01:49:04 You know what's okay the biggest disappointment about hollow knight
01:49:07 This is literally the worst thing about hollow knight
01:49:09 Is that there is a big area that is spider themed and there is a big arena in the spider themed area
01:49:16 Yet, there is no fucking spider boss in the game in a game about fighting bugs
01:49:21 It's like that is obviously going to be like the biggest thing
01:49:24 Maybe it's going to be like I think it might be like for dlc because they're going to make a horn at dlc soon
01:49:29 But it's ridiculous. Isn't it isn't isn't it weird how how like
01:49:34 scorpions or bugs
01:49:36 Are they I think they're technically
01:49:39 They're insects. Yeah, they're like spiders
01:49:43 Oh, okay. So spiders count. I guess scorpions count too then. Yeah, well, they're not dogs. That's for sure
01:49:49 Um, I I've got a question here from eric sea bass
01:49:53 Uh, what kind of show would you make with a youtube red series?
01:49:57 Undertale irl all dressed up as the characters and we would act it out in on the set
01:50:02 I think mage would make a good frisk
01:50:04 Yeah, because she has the dark side to her true and she would kill everyone
01:50:11 Of course, of course, um
01:50:13 Did uh, uh, you don't strike me as a metaton though
01:50:16 You strike me more as a as a as a like an asriel or like you might you'd probably be flowery now that I think about it
01:50:25 Yeah, uh, uh, what was I going to say? Oh, apparently somebody told me that there was like a new boss in the switch release of undertale
01:50:33 Which there is pisses me off a little bit. Can you spoil me on it at all gib? Is it I?
01:50:38 Yes, it is
01:50:39 I don't know where it is or what you need to do to find it, but it is mu mu kissy cutie
01:50:44 Which is the anime that um
01:50:46 Alphys watches. Oh, you know what that's okay. Is it a good fight? Is it cool?
01:50:51 I don't know. All I know is that it appears briefly in the trailer. Oh, or in a video somewhere
01:50:56 I'll have to that's really he's just he's just like man everyone
01:50:59 Everyone who's played undertale has bought it now. I guess I'll just have to put a new content in the switch version
01:51:05 So all you fucks buy it again. See that's the thing
01:51:08 I played undertale a bunch and I don't want to play it again
01:51:12 Uh, nothing against the game, but I played it too much and it's it's not a game
01:51:16 That's replayable beyond like four or five times like after that. It's not really you don't get that much out of it
01:51:23 I don't know. I haven't played it in a long time
01:51:26 Like a I mean I'm still burnt out after making my video that took a million years. Oh, well you made a video about it
01:51:32 I I could I could potentially get the switch version
01:51:35 Uh, and we'll buy a switch and then get the switch version. Yeah, and then you know have a little fuck because I still
01:51:42 I still don't legally own
01:51:44 You know, I don't think I ever played it legally either now that I think about it
01:51:47 I bought it for PS4, so I paid my dues. Oh, there you go. Are we gonna get doxed is Toby gonna dox me?
01:51:53 All right, I got a question from you Toby first arrows on
01:51:57 It says how do you guys not believe in ghosts when you have met the lord of ghosts?
01:52:02 Well, there is a lot of speculation that he's just a man in a suit, which I I believe personally. I'm not aware of his conspiracy
01:52:10 Yeah, yeah, it's a big one a lot of people are thinking that I mean if if you're in the rowdy fuckers cop killers
01:52:16 Uh discord you'll you'll know
01:52:19 Um that the lord of ghosts was dethroned. He's no longer a lord
01:52:23 He's just the ghost. He's been he's been gang raped and destroyed by a group of slime riddles
01:52:30 On the steps of what he was like elected like the leader of of
01:52:35 He he was elected the mayor, but he he's not the mayor or the lord because he was a lord of ghosts before he became the mayor, correct?
01:52:42 Yep, he was the lord of ghosts
01:52:43 He became the lord mayor of ghost and then he was he was um impeached so hard that he lost all ranks and titles
01:52:50 With the with the discovery with the new menu item of coleslaw on the kfc menu that allows
01:52:56 The the denizens of slime city to attack ghosts at last we can get a foothold against the nega slime and me and my brothers in the
01:53:03 In the rfck we slayed the nega slime
01:53:07 And then we had to turn our mob like ravenous rage towards the lord of ghosts
01:53:12 Who summoned it to begin with with his endless rocks that bitch
01:53:15 And those goddamn busters with that goddamn ghost busting coleslaw
01:53:21 Now that's one for the swear jar right there using that word
01:53:25 Um, well all the questions are shit. So maybe let's just wrap it up here
01:53:29 We didn't get a lot this time. Uh, we did but we did tons of the voice ones. Which are the good ones anyway
01:53:34 Yes, poor tech space bros. They're all dead. Yeah, all right. I guess we're done everybody. Oh, that was good
01:53:39 I felt like there was a lot of good stuff there. We did it. We did
01:53:42 It was a solid one solid like the poops that I pooped. Um, because I eat only protein
