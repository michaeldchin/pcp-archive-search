00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:29 Yeah, I'm the best guy ever, and today we're joined by Digibro.
00:00:46 If you can't tell the meme, you should.
00:00:47 But a welcome one, that's the one.
00:00:50 Hippocrit, there you go.
00:00:52 I'm alright, I'm pretty good.
00:00:54 I'm a pretty good character on the Pro Crastinators.
00:00:58 I agree.
00:01:00 And then the opposite of that would be Tom Oliver's here.
00:01:04 I have nothing to say, but I'm very upset.
00:01:07 How dare you.
00:01:08 Oh, okay, okay.
00:01:09 I go on your stream and everything and give you hours of free entertainment out of my time.
00:01:14 And you betray me the very next day.
00:01:17 That's true, that's true.
00:01:19 Disgusted.
00:01:19 Join us on the best guy ever live stream yesterday.
00:01:22 We're streaming Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and it was a great time.
00:01:26 Munchy and FitMC were there too.
00:01:28 You should check it out on twitch.tv.
00:01:30 God damn it, we're not even two minutes in, and ads.
00:01:35 Oh, that's what the people really come for.
00:01:37 No.
00:01:38 Let me get paid for this shilling.
00:01:40 I know, but I do.
00:01:40 At least to Squarespace.
00:01:42 How often have you guys started like a YouTube video now and the fucking, like as soon as you hear the ad, you just start going,
00:01:48 No.
00:01:50 I usually like, I go on recommended and I'm like, I mean, that sounds kind of interesting.
00:01:55 Clicking is like, is this video sponsored by Squarespace gone?
00:01:59 Like, I would rather just not.
00:02:01 It's the only videos that I get stuck with that on are things that YouTube recommends to me.
00:02:06 VPNs are the big hot thing.
00:02:07 When are we going to get a VPN ad deal?
00:02:10 This episode of the Procrastinators podcast is brought to you by Private Internet Access.
00:02:15 Private Internet Access is the most secure VPN for making sure you can get past all the geoblocks on your internet connection.
00:02:22 Watch lolliporn without being spied on by the government.
00:02:25 Private Internet Access slash the Procrastinators.
00:02:30 I mean, that would, that would be on brand, I think.
00:02:33 It would absolutely be on brand.
00:02:36 Man, I don't know.
00:02:37 Have you seen a lot of this?
00:02:38 I see what people seem to be doing.
00:02:40 I've thought about maybe this makes sense to incorporate, and I don't know.
00:02:43 We Aguas or something, but it's like, they start with like a summary of the issue.
00:02:47 You see like, today's episode of whatever, we're talking about how the libtards got blown the fuck out once again by strong African Americans or whatever.
00:02:56 But first, your VPN security or whatever, and then they go into it.
00:03:01 Ben Shapiro is the worst at that.
00:03:04 It's like a meme now.
00:03:06 Every time I listen to a show, it'll be, he'll be like, but first, and I'll immediately alt tab back to it.
00:03:10 And then like, he'll always have like a little like, cut in of it, and then I'll just scroll to when that like,
00:03:17 image disappears.
00:03:18 I can just skip all his ads.
00:03:19 It's great.
00:03:20 You know, it makes sense.
00:03:21 The good news is, since this is a YouTube video, do you guys spam ever since that hero, that unsung hero who I'll never forget that he taught me this,
00:03:29 grade A under A, with like his first big video teaching me that space bar is bullshit,
00:03:34 K is the instant pause or play video button on your keyboard,
00:03:39 and J and L are the skip forward and back 10 seconds buttons.
00:03:43 I'll never forget what a hero he is for teaching me that.
00:03:46 For some reason, that is stuck with me.
00:03:48 It's like the grade A under a tutorial that the only thing I actually care about him for.
00:03:53 Wait, why is that helpful?
00:03:55 Why is that better than using the space bar there?
00:03:57 For some reason, when pressing the space bar, just sometimes it just doesn't work and like it does some other function, but cable always forces it.
00:04:04 It's specifically, for whatever reason.
00:04:06 You have to have the window selected in order for it to work.
00:04:09 Well, the window selection, I think, all that allows you to use it.
00:04:13 No, the video selected rather.
00:04:14 Like you have to have clicked on the video last as opposed to have somewhere else on the page.
00:04:19 But if you're just on the page, the J, K, and L, those work just as long as the window is selected.
00:04:24 Interesting.
00:04:24 So interesting.
00:04:25 It's better.
00:04:25 It's dope.
00:04:26 It's real good.
00:04:27 It's real good.
00:04:29 Rest in peace.
00:04:29 I wonder what that guy's up to.
00:04:30 Him and Leafy.
00:04:31 Just in retirement.
00:04:34 I don't know.
00:04:35 You think, do you think, here's the thing.
00:04:37 Do you think we're just going to see continuous cycles of internet content creators forever?
00:04:42 Absolutely.
00:04:42 As you rise to prominence.
00:04:43 I think, yeah.
00:04:44 That's just top culture in general.
00:04:47 I was looking curiously at Game Grumps.
00:04:50 I had stopped watching for a long time and they have had this new show called 10-Minute Power Hour,
00:04:54 which is like Aaron and Dan doing live action stuff.
00:04:59 And that is the most popular thing because it's actually funny.
00:05:02 Yeah.
00:05:03 But the Game Grumps episodes are getting like 100 something to 500 something K views,
00:05:10 which is still a lot, but they have like 5 million subscribers.
00:05:14 And back in the day, they were getting basically the same, if not more, views than they were subscribers.
00:05:22 And it's just like less people give a shit, but more people subscribe.
00:05:27 And I don't, like Game Grumps, I feel like if they keep going down this road of just being
00:05:32 not that interesting, they're going to die.
00:05:35 And it's going to be really sad when it happens.
00:05:38 That's true.
00:05:38 But it's good to see them mixing up the formula, I guess, with new stuff.
00:05:41 I haven't really been keeping tabs on that.
00:05:42 I mean, I feel like they're going to, you know, survive like Aaron and all that.
00:05:48 But like the Game Grumps Let's Play show might actually end at some point.
00:05:53 And it won't even be like I'm sad that it's gone.
00:05:56 Because I wasn't watching it.
00:05:57 But like it just, it just makes me feel like everything is temporary.
00:06:02 Yep.
00:06:04 I have been really fascinated looking back through my own history of all my videos,
00:06:09 like all the different people I collaborated with,
00:06:11 and how many of them have just simply evaporated from the internet entirely.
00:06:16 Like people who were really good, and then they just like closed shop and disappeared.
00:06:22 And you've never heard from them again.
00:06:25 And it's just like, well, I guess what's what happens when YouTube doesn't really
00:06:28 pan out after a couple of years, you know, you're just gone.
00:06:31 It's true.
00:06:32 It's true.
00:06:32 I mean, even like, I don't know, things like the My Little Pony thing,
00:06:35 obviously that's tied to like a specific show.
00:06:37 But like, I don't know.
00:06:38 An interesting example I think of is a guy like who is still somewhat active.
00:06:42 And I quite like the guy, but it's Holden Reviews, the anime reviewer guy.
00:06:47 And that guy, like what happened to him is, as I understand it,
00:06:50 he kind of stopped doing YouTube as much because he just actually is a real animator
00:06:54 in the industry now.
00:06:54 So like, okay, so he's he's doing just fine.
00:06:57 But like his, I mean, it makes me wonder, like, for how many people is YouTube,
00:07:03 like a place to like, you know, rest and like, actually build a future on kind of,
00:07:08 where as opposed to it being like a step, I don't know how much involved it was for him.
00:07:12 I think for him, it was just fun.
00:07:13 But like, because he was he's like an animator at heart, as I understand it.
00:07:18 But and he did like anime reviews and stuff.
00:07:20 But now he's back to actually animating.
00:07:22 So but you can tell in his videos, like there was so much extra work put into them
00:07:28 that probably didn't give a return on investment.
00:07:30 Like I very much know that feeling.
00:07:33 But yeah, I mean, I wonder for how many people you can actually carve out a long standing space
00:07:38 that you can, I mean, I guess it depends if you're trying to make a living on it or not.
00:07:42 That makes a big difference.
00:07:43 I mean, yeah, the living on it, that it was always annoying to see that like animators like left.
00:07:52 I mean, this has been said a million times, like the way that the algorithm rewards
00:07:57 frequency of content and longer videos.
00:08:01 It just it just ends up like ruining people in terms of like they get all of their content out
00:08:09 that they could ever possibly make really fast.
00:08:12 And then for the rest of their life, they have nothing to do except do sponsorship deals
00:08:17 and sort of fuck around.
00:08:19 Yeah, because it's all about the frequency.
00:08:21 If it wasn't about the frequency, they could spend time to make, you know,
00:08:25 movies or short films or whatever it is, like like larger projects that stand on their own
00:08:30 and people return to algorithms are ruining our straight up.
00:08:35 Yeah.
00:08:36 Yeah, that's I mean, and I would argue that it's also kind of the the impetus for frequency of
00:08:40 content because I don't know yet.
00:08:42 We've said it a bunch before, but it's like, how much interesting stuff do you really have to say?
00:08:49 Probably not that much.
00:08:50 Everything's been said a million times.
00:08:52 So like you either need to be like a fucking Logan Paul style daily vlogger and like get into
00:08:57 shenanigans or just like talk about everything you think about and get people into that.
00:09:02 Or you can like take your time, cultivate something actually interesting to say and like
00:09:07 do some real work like an animator would or I don't know, like a documentary maker, for example.
00:09:13 And then, you know, it comes out and it's like a big like, oh, wow, this is impressive.
00:09:17 It's like the two options you have.
00:09:19 Here's something that ties into this.
00:09:21 I was thinking like advertising is the end of like the Internet.
00:09:24 If we keep relying on advertising, we will all die.
00:09:29 And the thing happened recently is that Tumblr cracked down on pornography because
00:09:35 they weren't able to get like the iOS app store app, you know, they couldn't have their app on
00:09:43 because it had too much, you know, risque stuff.
00:09:46 I think it was some somebody found child porn and that got reported and it was like, oh shit.
00:09:52 And then Tumblr responded in by banning all and any sexual content at all
00:09:59 because they want the ad revenue because they're a YouTuber and they're struggling.
00:10:02 They got to water down their content.
00:10:04 And now everybody is basically like, OK, well, goodbye.
00:10:08 Everybody's leaving and Tumblr will have nothing.
00:10:11 Like I get this idea.
00:10:13 I just heard about that today that like the reason was because they were trying to launch an app
00:10:17 and it got rejected and shit.
00:10:19 Like Twitter is on fucking Apple.
00:10:21 Twitter has porn.
00:10:23 Like to ban all porn is way over the top.
00:10:26 No, but it's because, you know, if people were aware,
00:10:31 like if the companies were aware of the stuff that was on all the platforms,
00:10:34 none of the platforms would be allowed.
00:10:36 Yeah, it's just because like some incident caused
00:10:40 caused iOS to be a web browser.
00:10:43 You know, there's a lot of really nasty stuff on the Internet.
00:10:47 Yeah, it's it's just like that there was an event that
00:10:51 clued iOS or Apple into Tumblr being a porn thing.
00:10:55 Like some executive gets a note saying Tumblr is bad.
00:10:58 He's like, oh, I guess we get rid of it.
00:11:00 Well, like it's gone gone.
00:11:02 I've been here.
00:11:03 No escaping the fact that we have all literally all of us.
00:11:06 I mean, I'm sure there's some saints out there who I guess haven't,
00:11:09 but any adult, I would argue, has done something in their life.
00:11:12 If the entire information of your life was laid out before like a judge in a fucking jury,
00:11:18 none of us would be innocent and we would all be shut down or taken off whatever
00:11:24 because you can just cherry pick.
00:11:25 And that's that's it.
00:11:27 You can characterize people based on their worst actions once or twice.
00:11:30 And I mean, and that's why like that's actually a great argument.
00:11:35 Literally, why have we not banned every Internet browser?
00:11:40 Because they all facilitate your exposure to hate speech.
00:11:44 I can go to altright.com or whatever.
00:11:47 Communism dot like whatever's evil.
00:11:49 I can just go there.
00:11:50 Nate, don't tell me.
00:11:51 Dot com.
00:11:52 Well, like the reason has to be right that they are a like they're a what's
00:11:57 the distinction that's being made?
00:11:59 They're not a curator of content.
00:12:00 They are a a platform.
00:12:02 That's the platform of a publisher.
00:12:04 That's got to be the defense that allows the shit to work, right?
00:12:08 Because like how does any browser defend itself while allowing you to get to literally hateful
00:12:14 places unless that's the argument that they're not choosing what to show you.
00:12:17 It's on the consumer to choose what they are and aren't exposed to.
00:12:22 The weird thing, though, is that like legally all these social media sites are platforms
00:12:26 and not publishers, even though they're making editorial decisions as tumblers clearly exemplifying
00:12:30 right now, they're currently getting away with having their cake and eating it too.
00:12:34 And that's at some point, I would hope that that gets addressed or like like a lawsuit
00:12:39 against a company like this, like by people being ideologically repressed or whatever.
00:12:45 Like I get, you know, they're a free company, but like that you can't curate the shit that
00:12:50 you choose to ban and also say you're free and open platform because you are making
00:12:55 decisions on an editorial basis about what it is and that you're lying what you're not.
00:13:01 There's more to the tumbler thing because I started looking into it because like
00:13:05 my friend Matt, who I do market how do it, like his blog got pulled and like he lost all his shit.
00:13:10 Shit, what was it for what?
00:13:11 He did like NSFW commissions and like lived off of it for like a year and like made a lot of
00:13:15 money off it and they just got deleted and because they deleted accounts, all of his safer work
00:13:20 stuff got deleted as well because they were tied to the same account. And like he got them back
00:13:24 after like bitching about it, but like the next day they're like, Oh, we're just deleting all this
00:13:28 on the 17th. Anyway, so this was his tumbler page. This was on tumbler. Yeah. But the interesting
00:13:33 thing with tumbler is that like apparently tumbler was already planning on doing an NSFW
00:13:40 ban because tumbler, it started back in like 2011. It was an independent company. Then in 2013,
00:13:46 it was purchased by Yahoo. Yahoo did nothing with it. So in last year, 2017, tumbler was bought
00:13:56 from Yahoo or I think Yahoo entirely was bought by Verizon. So tumbler is owned by Verizon now and
00:14:02 they wanted to use that network of like tumbler and like Yahoo stuff to sell ads. So the reason,
00:14:09 like they're not making any money off tumbler right now because of all that the porn shit,
00:14:13 they can't sell ad space against it. So it all comes back to Gibbs point about how ads are ruining
00:14:18 the internet. Well, that's that's why I thought that's why you brought it up, I think, right?
00:14:22 The yeah, the future I feel is like people funding the stuff they like. I'm glad we have Patreon.
00:14:31 I'm just I'm just like wary of like Patreon also succumbing to this bullshit.
00:14:36 And they just banned a bunch of they banned Milo Yiannopoulos. Yeah, and a few other guys.
00:14:43 Did you guys? Sargon got banned as well in this recent thing. And the the reason why they banned
00:14:49 Sargon is very interesting. And it was because I have I saw his video about it before this,
00:14:54 it was that on someone else's live stream. He used the word white hard R n word, right, and to
00:15:04 describe the alt right as like they're acting like the black people they claim to like think
00:15:09 or lesser and like bad and shit. So he used that term to describe them. And so that's that's
00:15:16 so on someone else's why it was not on his channel. I mean, he didn't do you a couple for that,
00:15:23 right? Because I mean, you should know did you because the man's got an edgy soul,
00:15:27 and which I can certainly relate to. I can too. But like, even I would make sure
00:15:33 that if I was going to use a phrase like that, it was in a context that was that I could easily
00:15:38 defend myself on, you know, well, like the context is fairly good hearted. Like he's making an
00:15:44 anti identitarian argument in the like in his actual say, saying like, guys, guys, all right,
00:15:49 people who are currently trolling me, you're acting like the people that you claim to hate and are
00:15:54 bigoted against by doing that, he's like implying that the type of people that they hate exist
00:15:59 and are worthy of that hatred. I mean, he would absolutely argue and was his point that like
00:16:06 he doesn't agree with that, but by their argument, they're behaving like in this way.
00:16:11 So I can't be confused. Not worth it. Not worth the joke. Okay, that's fair.
00:16:14 That's fair. Not worth getting yourself in trouble for.
00:16:16 Well, what's interesting about it is that Jack Conte in his in his interview with Dave Rubin
00:16:22 specifically, this is like a year ago or something, a couple months, he specifically states
00:16:27 about how they police the content that people host on Patreon, as well as their, I think it's
00:16:33 manifest observable actions, like the shit you do in real life. Like, like Lauren Southern,
00:16:38 when she got banned, that's because she got her boat to like interfere with migrants trying to get
00:16:42 to Europe or whatever. So like, okay, that's something she did. Sargon, like, I, this is not
00:16:48 a manifest observable. He didn't do anything. He used a word that, you know, they, they don't care
00:16:53 for, which is okay, fair enough. But it was on someone else's stream, whereas the trust and
00:16:58 safety people were the ones who actually banned Sargon because he had used this thing on someone
00:17:04 else's stream. But Jack Conte made it super clear. They only police as long as it's not
00:17:10 manifest observable behavior, anything you say is your business elsewhere. They are only going
00:17:15 to ban you on Patreon. If it's content supported by Patreon, and this is somebody else's stream,
00:17:21 this was unrelated. He didn't post this shit to Patreon. So I mean, basically, there's a
00:17:27 lies going on here. It's not lies. It's just, it's just general incompetence. They say that
00:17:32 they're going to do that. But if they get like, you know, they're, you know, they probably would
00:17:37 be like, I fucking hate Sargon, but we got nothing on him. Like, like, there's some people who just,
00:17:42 you know, they have some general idea of what a certain type of person is on my platform.
00:17:47 And they get a small opportunity to get rid of him. They're like, oh, good. And even if it's not
00:17:52 like malicious, it could just be somebody got informed. And it is, you know, the same thing
00:17:57 with like, the executive getting a note, saying Tumblr is bad, the executive of Patreon getting
00:18:02 a note. This guy said a bad word. This is a bad thing. This guy's a bad guy. It's like, oh, he's
00:18:08 a bad guy, click the bad guy button, ban that bad guy, the word lie. I should not have done that
00:18:13 because I hate, I feel like saying the word lie implies direct malicious intent, all that stuff,
00:18:19 which I don't think was had. I think these are people in their bubbles, not communicating outside
00:18:24 clearly and then like having different views of the world. I mean, in this case, this does seem like
00:18:28 an actual miscommunication between like the trust and safety people and Jack, because Jack said,
00:18:33 like, you won't be judged this way unless you physically do something in the real world. I
00:18:38 don't know. Maybe they have an issue with like Sargon literally being a political
00:18:42 entity now. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I don't trust anybody to say anything that is
00:18:50 what they will do. Yeah. Because it's never, ever happened. I would be willing to say that they
00:18:56 probably legitimately think that Sargon performed some kind of illegal hate speech with what he said.
00:19:04 Like, they probably just think that like what he did in real life was in fact like, like, if they
00:19:10 don't have necessarily even the full context into what he said, or if they do, and they just think
00:19:15 that even with context, it comes across as hate speech, they might just see it as like, oh, like,
00:19:20 this guy crossed the line that we don't allow creators to cross. I don't know if they have,
00:19:26 if they're supposed to have a line like that, though. Well, here's the fucked up thing.
00:19:30 This put, this means that we all can be banned from Patreon at any time. Yeah, the groundwork
00:19:36 has been set because like we've all done basically the same thing that Sargon did. We've all hard
00:19:41 arred on this podcast. Well, I don't know if it's just the fact that he hard arred or like the
00:19:46 implication behind his words. I would say that what we do probably is worse than that. If he's
00:19:53 trying to like insult, like take down like a hateful ideology by giving an example of their
00:19:59 own backwards thought. That's like, I think, a better moral ground than just saying the word
00:20:05 just for fun. That's true. Well, I mean, yeah, like, okay, like, because actually there was some
00:20:11 clarification on this, that it was like, the issue is you can't use the word, I think we said, in an
00:20:15 insulting way. So like, so okay, so like, if you simply state it in an academic way, like blah,
00:20:21 blah, blah, the, you know, the N word is used to insult people, blah, blah, racial hatred, whatever.
00:20:26 But like, if you, if you call someone that, like, you call a black person that like, okay,
00:20:31 now you're insulting people. But he's calling white people that. So it's like, you know,
00:20:36 I don't know, I feel, I feel like they just didn't look at it very hard. I don't imagine people
00:20:43 looking at it very hard and thinking about anything. They just, oh, they heard the heart are
00:20:50 this is the bubble effect, because like, you get exposed to one tiny bit of information, like,
00:20:54 okay, he said the word, we've got an audio, you can hear it, like, boom, case closed, that's all we
00:21:00 need. Ship him down the line, it's over. It's really annoying how like, you know, robots and
00:21:07 algorithms are terrible, but also real humans are just as bad. We're all broken, we're all fucked up.
00:21:16 For the record, I don't even think the most malicious use of the word in the world should
00:21:20 be grounds for like, taking someone off the internet or banning them or whatever. I mean,
00:21:25 I've been thinking about this, like, I mean, this is stuff we probably already agree on.
00:21:31 And it's not like mind blowing. But like, I was just thinking like,
00:21:35 a much, much more racist thing to say is like, we don't serve your kind here. And that doesn't
00:21:40 have the heart are anywhere. That's true. It's just like, we've literally just, I mean, we've
00:21:47 talked about this, but like, we give words so much fucking power, guys. It's really just like,
00:21:53 the people who are actually racist know that they're going to get in trouble. So they just
00:21:57 imply it heavily and they can't get in trouble because they use the right words.
00:22:01 This is the thing that gets me about this. Okay, it's like, okay, like, like guys like PewDiePie,
00:22:05 guys like Sargon, they've, they've dropped that heart are my dude. Okay, got it. Literally,
00:22:10 what was the intent exactly what Tom just said? What was the intent here? Like, I mean, okay,
00:22:15 PewDiePie slips up and says it, you know why? Look, I feel an empathy with PewDiePie on this.
00:22:21 It's a word that makes people mad. And it's the worst word you can think of that I'm sure
00:22:26 that is why he said it. Because if you asked PewDiePie, why did you say that word? That's
00:22:31 what he would say. He wouldn't say, you know, let's get back to Sargon. Like, why did you say
00:22:35 this word? He's like, well, because I'm trying to create a point that like the alt right is wrong
00:22:39 about their, you know, whatever racist stance. And so that's why I use the word like if you
00:22:43 and okay, you ask, okay, how do you feel about black people? And he's going to be like, yeah,
00:22:47 it's fine, you know, right? It's cool. Nothing to worry about their races are different or, you
00:22:52 know, there are different races. It's fine. There's I don't discriminate. Like, okay, you ask them
00:22:57 the question, you get the answer. But no, we need to deduce the true nature of people because
00:23:04 they're all going to lie to us. They're going to attempt to pull the wool over our eyes, right?
00:23:08 We can't take people at their word. But if you just talk to them, they would tell you how they
00:23:13 feel about this shit. But we got to be the fucking Gestapo here. We got to be the fucking moral
00:23:17 police. You know, what it really comes down to is not that like people are excessively moral,
00:23:25 but like if Patreon was just, you know, inclusive, and people who were racist could get a platform,
00:23:33 it just depends on them finding racists to be paying them. Like if there was no moral,
00:23:41 you know, jumping in, it was just like a neutral platform, then they would lose money over like
00:23:46 PR disasters of like, Patreon accepts Nazism. And then a competitor would come up and say,
00:23:54 we're lovely on, we love people and we're against hate speech. Patreon's not against hate speech.
00:24:00 So come to us instead. And then that site would get all of the money and then Patreon would have to
00:24:05 be like, oh, shit. It's always a fucking money thing. And I don't like that.
00:24:09 I think that it's it's a money thing. But I also think that it has to do with the fact
00:24:14 that Patreon and like all these companies that are doing all these rules are from like Silicon
00:24:20 Valley, like the same kind of area in California. And they're largely informed by the moral values
00:24:27 of what is like normal there. And like when you're in a place where there's just like an
00:24:32 overwhelming amount of not just like liberal people, but like talking heads like media pundits
00:24:39 who are everywhere because every celebrity wants to have that as part of their image that they're
00:24:44 taken seriously. And everyone in Hollywood wants to have an agenda for for personal clout reasons
00:24:51 to have a narrative about who they are, you know, and like all these companies are surrounded by that
00:24:57 and following in that moral footstep. And it's really funny because Dick Masterson will talk
00:25:04 about this on his show and like complain about Silicon Valley types and their moral codes.
00:25:09 But he has he struggles to use the word retarded, like he'll stop himself, he'll avoid using it
00:25:17 because where he's from, it's like seen as a big deal to use that word because they're just like
00:25:24 it had like major policing on it in the late 2000s. So it's like a whole campaign against it
00:25:29 where I'm from people say retarded constantly. Yeah, it's totally not offensive to me. No,
00:25:35 not in the slightest. So like, it's really fucking funny when I hear him like stop himself from
00:25:41 saying retarded, he'll say it anyways, but like he'll he'll whinge about doing it. And I'm like,
00:25:46 it's really fucking hilarious to see the guy who writes men are better than women whinging about
00:25:51 using the word retarded on his fucking show. But that's how deeply it affects you when you live
00:25:57 in a place where everyone feels that way, where they really will give you shit for using the word
00:26:02 and like make you feel bad and give you their sob story. See, like, you know, like in in this
00:26:08 discussion today, I'm censoring myself saying the n word because I'm here giving it power.
00:26:14 But nigga, it goes out. There you go. Nigger. See, it's fine. We're talking about in an academic
00:26:19 way. What Sargon said, white nigger, everyone. That's what he said. Now, you know, you've heard
00:26:24 it from my mouth. Like retarded roles like butter, baby, like butter. Oh, it feels good. I love it.
00:26:33 And like, I mean, the word okay, just I this is silly, whatever we're talking about this, but
00:26:36 like the word idiot and moron literally defined clinical states of being for people of like
00:26:42 mental disability or low IQ. It's just that nobody gives a shit anymore. That's the only difference
00:26:48 that culturally we don't care. And guess what? I grew up in a culture where nobody fucking cared
00:26:54 about saying the word retarded. So what are you going to oppress my culture with your culture
00:26:58 out on the fucking west coast or whatever? Why do you get the right to do that? You don't. Fuck you.
00:27:03 And I'm not just going to say that people the most offended just win in every situation. Like
00:27:08 no, and those those people who are in California and they're looking at it in that that mindset,
00:27:14 again, to them it's normal, but it's not just that it's normal for them. It's that the people
00:27:19 around them are yelling at the rest of the country because of their perception of how those people
00:27:24 are that they perceive it as like, oh, everyone's everyone's being mean to retarded people and
00:27:28 offending them. And it's like, no one even connects this phrase to like an actual like nobody
00:27:33 recognizes a retarded person when they see them per se. We call things retarded when you like
00:27:39 just a regular person does something stupid, you know? Yeah, it's culture shock. It's global
00:27:45 culture shock. I just it doesn't mean anything. It's and I'm going to keep saying new fag moral
00:27:51 fag. It's interesting with with gay because like, yeah, gay is become a little bit more like fag is
00:27:58 more acceptable than gay to me. It's probably true since like, um, like, I don't know just where I
00:28:05 was when gayness was like becoming it was it was a thing in school people would say, oh, you're gay.
00:28:11 And then I was growing up and on the internet people were gay and I was like, oh, is it okay to
00:28:15 be gay? And then I realized it was but it was just like and like now I can't say that because that's
00:28:20 not very nice. But then, you know, fag, I'd never heard of fag. We don't say fag in the UK. So I can
00:28:26 say fag it all the time every day. Do you still say fagged for cigarettes or is that just an old
00:28:30 school thing? It's it's a bit of an old school thing. All the older gentlemen in the old cockney
00:28:37 London town would probably say fags. That's for that. You know, this this whole thing reminds me
00:28:44 of Majid Nawaz, the the Islamic guy, anti and basically anti like extremist activist and
00:28:53 shit. And he he made the point that like when he was getting sued by sorry, he sued the Southern
00:28:59 Poverty Law Center, which is based in Alabama, a bunch of white dudes, these guys decide what is
00:29:07 acceptable and like what's hate speech. And then they let everybody know they put you on a fucking
00:29:10 list as they did with him, basically putting a target on his back for extremists to come to.
00:29:16 And like, these people are dictating what this Muslim man these Christian guys are dictating
00:29:22 what this Muslim man is allowed to criticize about his religion and his culture. And they deem
00:29:29 the fact that he has identified this is not me making a judgment. This is his words that like
00:29:33 there's an extremist problem in Islam, like and he wants to work on that and address it within
00:29:39 like respectfully as a Muslim himself within the culture. And they call that hate speech. Well,
00:29:44 there's a reason why he sued them for that and fucking one and that they had to take it back
00:29:49 and apologize. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Yeah. And there's a bunch of fucking
00:29:53 white Christian dudes policing with this fucking guy who was deep in the shit man deep in the
00:29:59 shit went to fucking jail for like 10 years for being an extremist. Yeah, that's right.
00:30:05 I might might might have been a little bit less than that, but it was a long fucking
00:30:07 time. Well, I'm glad he fucking sued him. Yeah, damn right. And he fucking won. And I don't think
00:30:13 they've learned anything, but I don't know. Hopefully the money will make him regret it.
00:30:17 I think he won like three million or something. Oh, God, man. Well, you know what people, we get
00:30:24 it, right? We're all on the same page here. You know what? You don't have to fucking agree with me
00:30:28 exactly, but at least represent like if you're going to debate me, just all I ask is that you
00:30:34 actually address the points that I'm saying or anybody else is saying, right? When we talk past
00:30:39 each other, it's a complete fucking waste of time. Yeah, please. Nothing gets done. I always want to
00:30:44 remind anybody who listens to this show. I can't speak for you guys, but I don't listen to any
00:30:51 fucking political shit on the internet. There's nobody who I follow who's like my political guiding
00:30:58 light. And like a lot of these fucking kids, when you start going on like a political tirade,
00:31:03 they start trying to figure out who you're quoting or like who they can find a video essay that their
00:31:08 side has made that they can link to you to show you the other side of the argument. And it's just
00:31:13 like, look, I'm not coming at this because I have like an agenda. I don't vote, you know? I don't give
00:31:17 a fuck. I'm just looking at the world and trying to parse it in a logical manner to be consistent
00:31:24 with its own rules, you know? I respect that. I must admit, I'm getting, well, listen to a bit more,
00:31:31 you know, a couple of years ago, listen to the Young Turks a lot these days, listen to more
00:31:36 like Sargon and Tim Pool and guys. I wish I could just, I want to just not do any of it. Are those
00:31:41 like political opposites from each other? Yeah, they are. Yes, they are. Yes, they are. That's
00:31:45 because like things have gotten a lot more extreme. And it's funny that you mentioned that because like
00:31:49 I have only starting like three days ago, I made an active decision to unsubscribe from all the
00:31:55 political shit and just not a bad stop. Every time they pop up on YouTube, just click not interested
00:32:01 because I feel bad because I think there is like some sort of, I think there is something valuable
00:32:07 in being like educated on what's going on in the world. And that's kind of why I got into it in
00:32:11 the first place because I wanted to like just be informed. Yeah, but it's such a fucking downer
00:32:17 sometimes. And I'm just like, that's, that's the reason that like, I really only listen to the dick
00:32:22 show that even comments on that kind of stuff. And to me, it's enough to just hear that that
00:32:28 something's happening. I don't want to hear anybody's like opinion about it. Like I don't want to hear
00:32:33 Sargon give his spin on a story because they all tell the stories in the way that benefits their
00:32:39 side. And even if they tell it well, like I love Razor Fist because he does a lot of research and
00:32:46 he will present a lot of evidence for a point, but he will always be more forgiving towards the
00:32:51 people on his side and like extra come down with people on the opposite side. And even if it's a
00:32:55 little tongue in cheek and like jokie and irreverent, it still is like, I have to take this with a grain
00:33:00 of salt because I know that you have an affiliation, you know, whereas with, with at least the dick
00:33:06 show, he is so politically neutral and somebody who normally wouldn't vote that like I can, he
00:33:13 doesn't usually really share his opinion on it. He just kind of riffs on the fact that a thing is
00:33:19 happening, you know, and that's easier for me to consume because it's not like a guy trying to
00:33:26 tell me how to feel about an event. It's just a guy reacting to it in a funny way. And then I hear
00:33:31 about it. I find out something's going on without having to listen to the hot takes and the immediate
00:33:36 press coverage that all wants to be as inflammatory as possible because that's what gets attention.
00:33:42 You know, I was just going to say where our brains are just being captured, at least, you know,
00:33:47 me, for example, like Tim Pool is a smart guy. I like him, but I do feel he is going for the
00:33:54 clickbait titles and like they, I'm sure a part of it's like a joke and self-aware, but I can just
00:34:00 feel the aura of like, let's get these views, let's like represent the story, at least with the title,
00:34:06 you can like read further for clarification, like, oh my god, battlefield five, you know, hates all
00:34:12 men or something, and not that he necessarily did that, but like they do it on both sides, right?
00:34:17 They skew things a little bit, they tweak it just based on maybe their own perceptions or something,
00:34:22 but like, you don't get the full truth when you listen to either people embedded and whatever,
00:34:26 Tim Pool's in the middle or whatever, but it's just, the whole thing is, it's unproductive
00:34:31 and probably specifically counterproductive to just making your life better, working hard on
00:34:37 shit you care about. It's a good thing that we did something unproductive for the last half an hour
00:34:41 then talking about this and wasting everybody's time. I just think that like it's, it's not cool
00:34:50 or like a good idea to be ignorant willingly, but I feel like it is very respectable to admit
00:34:58 when you are ignorant on something rather than taking any old thought that you hear.
00:35:05 You know what the thing about that is though, Gib, I feel, the reason that I'm, I feel almost
00:35:10 paralyzed politically a lot of the time, it's because I legitimately feel everybody,
00:35:15 basically everybody who's not a complete idiot. By the way, offensive word, why are you okay with
00:35:20 that word and not retarded people, think about it. God, I'm so fucking smart, my brain is absolutely
00:35:25 check, I can't, Jesus Christ. I checkmated all of them. I forgot my point now because I was just
00:35:34 talking about how smart I was. Okay, you know what, it doesn't matter.
00:35:38 All right guys, I had to, oh, Kippo, you go ahead. Oh, no, no, if you got something.
00:35:43 I had a great idea for a good Pokemon anime. Okay. It would be like a mixture of like Code
00:35:50 Geass and Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon and the idea is that the main character is like, like a guy with
00:35:57 like a big smile on his face, scheming, kind of like Sora from No Game, No Life and he's like,
00:36:02 I'm gonna become the champion through fucking tactics. And so through the show, you'll see
00:36:07 him like watch other, he'll watch like a gym leader fight somebody else and they'll pull out like,
00:36:12 you know, you'll see their spread and like what tactics they're using and why they're so hard to
00:36:17 beat and then he'll come in and he'll have like really obscure counter picks. So like every time
00:36:23 he reveals his Pokemon, it's always like, oh yeah, like muck happens to have an immunity to this
00:36:28 thing. I was inspired for this because of a false swipe gaming, the YouTube channel who
00:36:34 of all of you heard of him, if not for anyone in the audience who doesn't know,
00:36:38 he does videos that are about how viable each Pokemon was throughout the generations in competitive
00:36:44 play. And because of the fact that Pokemon's competitive play is split into categories
00:36:48 where there's like the Ubers, the underused, the overused, like Pokemon can have, you know,
00:36:56 matchups that like even if it's not the best Pokemon, it could have a place in one of those
00:37:01 categories of fighting. So because of that, there's lots of really unique matchups that
00:37:07 can happen in Pokemon where like specific guys can be used for specific tactics. And if you wrote
00:37:12 an anime around that, it would make Pokemon seem really cool and deep and smart. And it would be
00:37:18 really fun to watch and the main character would be a badass. And you could get away with making it
00:37:22 like it would feel kind of edgy without having to actually be edgy. Like it would be completely
00:37:28 family friendly, but older. If you made it look cool enough, older kids would also be into it,
00:37:33 you know, that just kind of just sounds like the earlier generations and the nerds were kind of
00:37:38 afraid of like being a little bit edgy with like Mewtwo's origin and shit, as opposed to now where
00:37:44 it's kitty baby fuck time. I don't think it's kitty baby fuck time now. But like, like the movies
00:37:51 later had like a fucking war in one of them. Did you know there was a Pokemon war in one of the
00:37:57 movies? Did they shoot guns? Oh, was it was that the one with them? Well, there was a war in Gen
00:38:03 one with Lieutenant Surridge having come back from the war with his electric boys. That's true,
00:38:07 but they show a war in one of the movies where like people are writing on mammoth swines and
00:38:12 thrusting spears into each other, like writing on mammoth swines and Charizard's. It's in like
00:38:16 the Diamond and Pearl movies, I think, or the black and white movies. Dude, I'd love to write a
00:38:21 Charizard and then kill everyone with a spear. That would be great. Where's that Pokemon game?
00:38:26 You know, that reminds me of, did anybody ever watch a living flamethrower using a spear? Make
00:38:31 sense to me. Well, whatever. Did anybody ever actually watch? I always wanted to. There was
00:38:37 like an OVA that was I think it's six episodes long that like actually covers like red, like
00:38:43 actually charging the elite foreign shit. They're good. It's pretty sick. Like that that sound
00:38:48 like so there's the show the show in general is kitty baby fuck time. But this this OVA is like
00:38:56 technically more true to the games in that the character is actually making progress and like
00:39:00 defeating gyms left right and center and being a badass. I think the final episode is the final
00:39:04 champion fight against blue and all that. And dope. It's like actually hardcore legit. There's
00:39:09 like an infamous scene in that when he fights like something for the first time and I think he
00:39:13 had Charmander. His Charmander just gets like bitten and it just screams in pain for like 30
00:39:17 seconds and you're just like, oh, this is what we've been playing for years. That's a little
00:39:22 too real. That's a little different. Oh, wait, animal abuse is a thing. Like they went the root
00:39:26 of making it like, whoa, it's like a little like spooky because it's like violent. Do you like
00:39:31 they actually in pain? But like I want to go more the root of like the main character is like really
00:39:36 deeply strategic because yeah, like we'd frame it like Yu-Gi-Oh where you're just going to explain
00:39:41 what the thing does anyway. So it's it's going to be like they they fucking but like if you if you
00:39:46 know the game well enough, then you can see the things coming. You can see everything falling
00:39:50 into place and you'd be excited and we wouldn't reveal who the Pokemon that he has on his team
00:39:56 are until they like come out, you know. So it might be that like he watches a gym leader fight
00:40:01 and then it'll be like he goes, huh, guess I've got some Pokemon to go catch. And then like in
00:40:06 the next episode of he's fighting the gym leader and like maybe he'll like pick out a Pokeball
00:40:11 and he'll be like, huh, I thought you were going to use that. And then it'll cut to a flashback
00:40:15 of him like in a location where this Pokemon to be found. So if you know what it's going to be,
00:40:19 if you know what a good counter pick is, you'll be like, oh, shit, he's in the fucking power plant,
00:40:24 he's going to get fucking Zapdos, you know, and then we get like a clip of him catching Zapdos.
00:40:30 And like it'll be interspersed with footage of him summoning it for the battle. So then it's like
00:40:34 showing both the hard challenge he had of catching it as well as the challenge of using it to overcome
00:40:40 the boss, you know, and then like you can match cut like the ball
00:40:46 against like the final attack, fucking draining the last hit points off of the fucking boss,
00:40:50 you know. So that makes sense. Oh, so it's like Hiroyuki Sawano music, like Kill La Kill,
00:40:56 fucking attack on Titan, like epic fucking trick or Pokemon anime would be great.
00:41:01 Oh, yeah. Well, so would these okay, now I think I have the idea, but I gotta ask anyway,
00:41:06 are we talking about like actual game strats that would be implemented, or is it going to be like,
00:41:11 like you said inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh. So does that mean we're going to pull out like some weird
00:41:15 bullshit like the fact that was immune to electricity. There's already enough in the
00:41:21 actual meta of the game that if they did it based on the real meta, the fucking Pokemon
00:41:25 nerds would be like just eating it the fuck up like the guys who think the anime sucks because
00:41:30 it's baby shit because they like the deep tactics of the games like if you gave them an anime that
00:41:35 like played up, you know, the kind of shit that like Nuzlockers or competitive players are into
00:41:41 then like they'll fucking lose their minds. How long is it going to take? How long is it going to
00:41:47 take until like the Pokemon company, the game freak, like understands that there are a lot of
00:41:54 older big nerds that will love Pokemon if they made Pokemon. I think they will never care because
00:42:00 that's a much smaller group than just the world. Could they have like a branch of a game dev team
00:42:05 to make a little version of something? I mean, I think with Mario and Luigi RPG, those don't sell
00:42:10 as well as like the fucking, you know, big Mario platformer, but like people love them and they'll
00:42:14 buy them, so do it. I think that with the with Pokemon though, it's just that like the easier
00:42:20 way to reach the Pokemon is too big. Like it's bigger than its hardcore audience. Like yeah,
00:42:26 they could make games that were just for the hardcore people, but there's lots of adults who
00:42:30 will be interested in Pokemon in a much more basic way who just will play the kiddie games
00:42:36 and like the normie games and not even think about it. And like, I think that like let's go
00:42:42 Evie and Pikachu. Like a lot of people have made it to do about it being like a baby game, but I
00:42:46 think it's way more for like the people who were into Pokemon in the 90s and then got out of it and
00:42:53 then came back with Pokemon Go. And like it's trying to appeal to those people and be like, hey,
00:42:58 we remade that game from your childhood, but with the mechanics of the thing that you like to play
00:43:03 now and you know, reimagine with modern graphics. On today's episode, there's three people who like
00:43:09 Pokemon Go and then only me on the opposite side who has not even played the game. I
00:43:15 can't defend myself. I mean, let's go. I mean, let's go. I haven't played let's go either because
00:43:20 it's a video game and you got to buy it and I don't have money to put to like like Pokemon
00:43:24 Let's Go in a perfect world. If it was a free thing, I would definitely have it and I would love
00:43:28 it because it looks great and it gets rid of a lot of annoying tedious bullshit that didn't
00:43:32 like out of the Pokemon games because they are JRPGs and I don't really like that. They just take
00:43:37 so much time. Well, so like Pokemon Let's Go is great for me, but like I forgot the point I was
00:43:44 saying. Speaking of JRPGs, everybody go watch my Tales of Fantasia analysis on the I Am Games
00:43:50 channel. That was good. Thank you. I haven't watched it yet. It's like 50 minutes though, ain't it?
00:43:54 Yeah, it's as long as fuck. It sounds deep as shit. By the way, by the way, just I was just
00:44:00 imagining. Okay, imagine that the the Pokemon OVA that you're thinking of there, Digi, is a nine
00:44:07 episode long OVA, maybe 10 if you want to one for each gym and then two for each gym and then but
00:44:14 imagine it. It basically it's like Katana Gatory or Katana Gatory, whatever it is. You got episode
00:44:21 one through eight where it's like insane strats, like talking about optimizing and observing gym
00:44:26 behavior and like what the leader does and then you beat them with tactically and you whatever.
00:44:30 But then the final episode, like he's prepped his team because I just experienced this with
00:44:34 my Nuzlocke. You prep your team. They're like God mode could prepare to defeat all of them in a row
00:44:40 and it's just like that final scene in the last episode of Katana Gatory where he just mows down
00:44:44 all of them for the final battle against the actually difficult one at the end who isn't
00:44:48 elementally themed. I fucking hated that Katana Gatory though. It was like I don't know why people
00:44:54 don't like it. It's so cool. Well, I didn't like the show at all. So well, okay, that's
00:44:59 understandable part of it. You know, Ben said the same thing though that like he thought I think it's
00:45:04 just that he hated the show and that the last episode. Okay, the thing is that like for me
00:45:08 watching that show like the writing style of Nisi always seen is that he likes to be extremely meta
00:45:14 and to like have all these twists for the sake of themselves. And to me, it felt very forced in
00:45:20 that show. It felt like he was like showing off how much he could undercut what he had set up.
00:45:26 You know, I mean, I just didn't even fucking I basically blanked out for the first like nine
00:45:30 episodes or whatever and just like let it wash you like well, there was like half an hour. Well,
00:45:39 there were like an hour long episodes. I think there was 12 the moment 13 or whatever. No,
00:45:43 because there's 12 stories. Yeah, okay, whatever point is like basically talked forever. And I
00:45:49 never cared about anything they were saying outside of like, just tell me how you're gonna
00:45:53 beat the next guy. Just tell me how you're gonna fucking fight this guy and not destroy the sword.
00:45:57 That's all I care about. Your personalities are boring and you're a blank slate, whatever. It's
00:46:00 fine. They're actually kind of interesting. There was that whole ninja thing going on. I didn't
00:46:04 care about that at all. I didn't know what the point of any of those characters was.
00:46:08 Do you know about how that story came about? No, I have no idea. It's a stunt novel where
00:46:14 Nisi Oesin decided to write a book every month for a year. So he wrote 12 books, one for each
00:46:21 sword and each one is just like about a different, you know, them trying to track down a different
00:46:26 sword held by a different person. And but that's also why it's like that's what I think sucks about
00:46:33 it. It clearly was just written like in a very speed, like efficient way and not really having
00:46:40 much thought put into it in the end. I bet that works way better as a book where I can like use
00:46:44 my imagination and like think because it just does not work as a fucking anime. And the show was
00:46:49 also adapted the same way. They did one episode a month for a year. That's why they were like 45
00:46:53 minutes long. And then fucking the last episode I felt was fucking dope. There were some weird
00:46:59 things, weird characters. I don't know. I don't know. This has been your PCP anime review for
00:47:07 get out of here plebe and the weave. All right. I have an artist's tale. A little story. A couple
00:47:15 days ago, I woke up at 7am with like a severe headache. And it was like the like a like a red
00:47:24 hot poker. The tip of a red hot poker was like in the center of my skull and I couldn't get at it.
00:47:29 And it really hurt. And it incapacitated me for the whole day. And I was just like drinking water
00:47:35 and trying to get better and feeling like shit and dying. And I couldn't work on any of the things
00:47:40 that I was working on up to that point. And because of that, like the day after I was still
00:47:46 recovering and I just I was trying so hard to work on the things and I was going all depressed
00:47:53 about like I'll just and I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't do anything. And it was just really
00:48:03 upsetting that like physical like pain could like interrupt my flow. And then I couldn't get it back
00:48:11 until just like five minutes before this podcast, where I was like, oh, you know, I should I should
00:48:15 do some stuff. And I was doing some stuff. And there was this one moment where I in order to
00:48:23 like cool off, I guess, I went outside at night out into the garden. And I was just looking at like
00:48:30 the silhouette of the trees, swaying in the breeze, the completely pitch black against like
00:48:37 the orange glow of the city street light street lamps off in the distance. And I was just I was
00:48:43 just like, God, like this, this, this is so beautiful and so calming and so perfect. And I
00:48:49 could only feel this particular way in this particular moment in having all this pain and
00:48:56 like slightly getting over it with this cold breeze and looking at this really nice like
00:49:02 this calming image. And I was just really, really wanted to to be able to like replicate that in
00:49:10 art in some way and show people how cool that this feeling I'm having is and I was so annoyed
00:49:16 because I suck at drawing and writing and everything. And I was like, I can't make this.
00:49:22 I can't paint a picture. I can't make a video game that feels like this.
00:49:25 Should have made a song.
00:49:26 God damn. I mean, I could but like I'm not I'm not even good at songwriting. I'm just
00:49:32 it was just really in that one moment.
00:49:37 It sucked.
00:49:38 I know what you mean. I know what you mean. I've felt that before.
00:49:41 The melancholy of not being able like knowing you can't replicate a feeling for,
00:49:48 you know, for yourself or for others.
00:49:51 I feel that I understand that because there's lots of like, there's lots of songs that I've
00:49:56 written in my head that are to express those kinds of feelings. But my pain is more from
00:50:02 not being able to replicate the sound in my head into reality that like, yeah, like I feel a certain
00:50:08 way. And then I go, oh, man, I could communicate how that felt this way. But I have no means by
00:50:15 wish to produce this thing in a way and like to enough of a degree that anybody would get it.
00:50:20 Because if I tried to just describe it to you, you won't get it. Like it needs to be done in
00:50:26 the form of like a song. But like, I just can't make that song. I don't know what I would need to
00:50:32 be able to. I don't even know what I don't know. Like I don't know what things I need to learn in
00:50:38 order to be able to produce this song. Yeah, that's what got me on the whole. Like, you know, I was
00:50:44 thinking I should I should figure out how to draw this and then make it real. And then people will
00:50:50 be like, Oh, dude, I know that sort of feeling. But it didn't work. And that was why I was getting
00:50:55 more depressed upon, you know, realizing that my skill level sucks. And I would need to work. But
00:51:00 it's so hard to work when I'm in so much pain. And I can't do anything. And I just ended up playing
00:51:05 Dark Souls 3, which is pretty good. At least that this story is a happy ending. Yeah. By the way,
00:51:12 unrelated, but kind of cool is Dark Souls 3. I usually spend like video game time, especially
00:51:21 Dark Souls, just listening to podcasts. But since I cut out so many podcasts, except Hello Internet,
00:51:27 I didn't really have anything to listen to while I was playing. And so I just had the
00:51:30 game audio and I had blasted it out the speakers. It was really loud. But it was like,
00:51:37 really immersive. Because, I mean, obviously, but like, imagine having the game audio be playing
00:51:44 when the game's playing. And it feels like it's a totally different experience. And I really
00:51:49 like it. And I would recommend people listen to that Foley. That Foley's really good. And it's
00:51:55 really scary when it's at max volume when you stab a guy and it's like, I can see it now. Give
00:52:01 just playing Dark Souls 3 having a grand old time, all the pain leaving him. And then he gets like a
00:52:06 calm point as he's like traversing through the land, he looks over and like the sun setting,
00:52:10 where these silhouettes of trees perfectly captured, he's like, God damn it, they can do it, but I
00:52:15 can't do it. That's that. Dude, it's exactly this sort of feeling. I was thinking like, oh, if I could
00:52:22 make a Miyazaki movie, there would definitely be a moment where it would see the silhouettes of the
00:52:27 trees and the city and this exact feeling would happen to me as a viewer. But dang it, I can't
00:52:34 do that. That's a lot of work. Yeah, it sure is. Fucking Miyazaki's. What the fuck? Yeah, why is the
00:52:41 world gay? You know, I heard he's coming out of retirement. Anybody else hear about this? He's
00:52:46 doing a CG movie. A CG movie. Yeah, his first ever. Completely gay. First ever that stands for.
00:52:55 Well, I guess we'll have to see how that goes. There was a new Ghost in the Shell standalone
00:52:59 complex announced as well, also directed by the guy who did the, yeah, and all. Is that going to come
00:53:05 out before Best Anime Ever, Ghost in the Shell? Probably. Probably. Maybe, maybe not. That was
00:53:13 the joke all along. That announcement was for this new version of Ghost in the Shell. And that's
00:53:18 why it hasn't out yet. You were just waiting for it actually to be released. Actually, it's a
00:53:21 collaboration between me and Mr. Ghost in the Shell himself. You know, to the Lord of Ghosts.
00:53:27 It is Best Anime Ever. Is Ghost in the Shell next season of standalone complex. It's been a long
00:53:32 time coming and please enjoy and pay my rent. Hey, Digi. Yes. You said a while ago, or not that
00:53:42 long ago, really, that you were talking about, like, Endless War, the Rowdy Focus Cop Killers
00:53:48 Discord video game as an ARG. Yeah. And although Munchie and Ben are not here, I would like to
00:53:54 know what you meant by that. Well, the game takes, it kind of takes place in an alternate version
00:54:00 of reality because everybody's playing like a character version of themselves. It's almost
00:54:04 like a role-playing game. Like, it's kind of an MMORPG, but like, because it's set literally in,
00:54:11 like, an alternate reality. Like, because it goes outside of the game board. Like, they hold
00:54:17 conventions for it and shit where, like, you know, the characters are still alive in as much as in
00:54:25 everyone's heads. So it's kind of like they're in a shared alternate reality to an extent. And like,
00:54:31 definitely, what got me thinking about it was that I was just on the IM Games Twitch channel and we
00:54:37 host everybody else, so there was a, there just happened to be a slime fest going on or something.
00:54:42 And they were like listening to what I assume was a Slime Times, like, audio recording. Like,
00:54:49 the in-game newspaper made by a fan has graduated to the level of being a radio program that they
00:54:57 play during live streams. And I was like, this is an alternate reality at this point.
00:55:02 Yeah, I wasn't sure when you said ARG initially, but like, yeah, that is very much, it is very much
00:55:10 a role-playing, like, character server. Because even though people are, like, normal, they generally
00:55:16 keep up some sort of appearance of, like, being completely insane. Because, like, Munchie used
00:55:23 to be big into, like, role-play threads on, like, slash MLP and shit. Like, he used to do a lot of
00:55:30 those character games, so I think that's probably, like, part of the inspiration behind it.
00:55:37 Yeah. I like it. I recently made some characters. The, the, the image of my, my discord icon is
00:55:46 Redman, one of the, the new rowdies. And, and his character is, his character is that he is a very
00:55:53 philosophical guy, but he's also like a big hulking blood beast that drinks blood and needs
00:55:59 always looking for blood. But he's just kind of a nice guy and he's kind of chill.
00:56:04 Yeah. And he thinks, he thinks a lot about video game analysis. He has a video game analysis channel
00:56:08 and he made a video about Pokemon Let's Go. Can I watch this? Is there a link to this?
00:56:13 Yeah, I can link it to you. Oh, shit. That reminds me of us. Put it in the show notes, people.
00:56:18 In the, in the story that I was working on a couple months ago that I was going to make on a
00:56:22 DAT browser, there was one guy who is basically inside of this universe I created. There's a
00:56:28 guy who's an AR programmer and he, he's like, if you wear AR glasses and walk around this town,
00:56:37 you can see like an overlay that he's created across the entire city. So like everywhere you
00:56:41 go, there's like holographic shit that you can see if you've got like glasses on. However,
00:56:47 he's a huge fan of Knuckles the Echidna. So everything in town is themed around Knuckles
00:56:52 the Echidna. And I made a Knuckles fan site that I just, I built myself out of HTML on a DAT site.
00:57:04 So I would link to it, but like I'd have to have it open for it to exist,
00:57:10 which is why that we haven't been talking about DAT as much lately.
00:57:13 Okay, okay. Hey, by the way, listen to the description of this YouTube channel for Red
00:57:18 Man. It reads, hi, I'm a rowdy fucker. I will get blood. Game reviews are my passion. That's the
00:57:26 full description. Yeah, I went, I went to extra lengths and I subscribed to like as many blood
00:57:34 related YouTube channels as I could. Jesus Christ. That's fucking hilarious. I will get blood.
00:57:39 Oh my God, featured channels. NHS Give Blood is a featured channel.
00:57:45 God damn. Well, what about Gun Girl? Where's her, you know,
00:57:48 Gun Girl is on the killer side and she is a, she's a Fortnite school shooter. She played
00:57:57 Fortnite and killed her parents because she loved Fortnite so much and she thought guns were cool.
00:58:01 And so she has a gun and she just goes around killing. And that is, that is, that is Gun Girl.
00:58:08 That sounds good. I kind of want to like make more of these characters, but I kind of just
00:58:12 like that they exist and they're in the server and they do, they can talk to people. Yeah, yeah.
00:58:19 God, Red Man. Please click on the link in the show notes, people. Check this shit out. I will get
00:58:25 blood. Game reviews are my passion. Yeah, he's all, he's all. It's really good.
00:58:34 Yes, it's great. I got to click on this fucking video and it's 18 minutes long.
00:58:40 Oh my God. It's just his face is huge and slowly is getting wider as the video goes on.
00:58:47 Is there any actual game analysis? There is like five minutes. He just,
00:58:52 he's just singing for like five minutes and then he starts talking about Pokemon Let's Go.
00:58:57 Oh no, it's, it's recorded like, it's got like, like a munchy level of effects on his voice.
00:59:04 Yeah, it does. Okay, this is good shit. This is where we need to be headed in the future.
00:59:09 This is where things are going. Yeah, so like, like role playing as strange characters is very
00:59:14 much the core of Endless War and, and it's more fun to do stuff like that than it is really to
00:59:21 play the game. Haha. That is literally true in my humble opinion. I thought that was like the
00:59:26 point was like the game is just a framework for this bizarre story. Well, there are some people,
00:59:30 I mean, for a while at the beginning of season two, I was pretty dedicated and was leading the,
00:59:34 the boards. Not, I wasn't first place or anything, but I was doing quite well actually playing the
00:59:38 game, but I've just, you know, I thought you were first place at some point was like the most
00:59:43 slimy. I might have been. I might have been. I can't remember offhand, but there's just people,
00:59:49 man who've not to insult them, but they got a lot more time than I do to play ratty fuckers,
00:59:53 cop killers, and you got God bless them for their dedication, but I just can't keep up. I can't do
00:59:58 it. It's cool though. It's cool shit. Hey, so Smash Bros is out. Smash Bros is out. That's exciting.
01:00:08 That's pretty cool. Check out the streams. They're all they've all got. They've all got them. But
01:00:16 all right, I'm so annoyed. Well, I'm not that annoyed. It's, it's fine. It's, it's understandable,
01:00:20 but like I go into a number of discords and then there are people, groups of friends, and there's
01:00:26 always a call going on and it's like, okay, I'll jump in the call. See what people are talking
01:00:29 about. They're all just in voice chat, playing Smash with each other. And I'm like, well, I
01:00:34 can't really listen to this because they're not talking. They're just going, oh, fuck you. Like
01:00:38 every single discord call I could possibly be in is a Smash call. I'm just like, well, I've been
01:00:44 playing Smash the entire time. Ooh, ah, getting the kill. Got him. There you go. That's what it
01:00:50 sounds like. Is that what your streams sound like? That was exactly. Getting the kill.
01:00:57 Plus 100. Here's what I wanted to talk about. I was, I was curious. I talked about this a little bit
01:01:02 when I was streaming yesterday, but, but I was curious what you guys think. So not every character
01:01:08 was unlocked in Smash Bros, right? In Smash 4, they were all unlocked. In this game, they are
01:01:14 not. And you have to play to unlock them. I like it a lot, but it took a long time. And I feel
01:01:22 that's going to annoy some, you know what? I don't even know why I'm, I actually, I literally like
01:01:25 that you have to do that. But you seem like the sort of person who would like that. I do. Other
01:01:30 people who are angry about it. I love it when other people are angry about things that I did
01:01:34 better than them at. That's literally true. But, but what I was annoyed at was that like, after I
01:01:40 had unlocked all the characters, and I know Tom said something about this yesterday, that he got
01:01:44 like a notification, but after like, I fought Chrom and I lost, right? After I like did the whatever
01:01:49 to unlock Chrom, like tucked off in a secret menu. Okay, I kept trying to like do the running thing
01:01:56 and then like do the 1v1 stock match, whatever to unlock Chrom and like Ridley. I've both lost it.
01:02:01 This is like 10 characters that's happened with because I'm shit at the game. But uh, uh, like
01:02:06 I kept doing it for like two extra hours. I was watching Star Trek or something and I'm like,
01:02:11 well, that's weird. Why am I not getting any of the characters popping up again? Turns out you
01:02:15 have to go to the fucking settings menu and in that menu, there's like a little thing that's like,
01:02:19 do a rematch against the characters. And so I fight Chrom. Guess what? I lose again. All right,
01:02:24 because I'm shit at the game, but fuck it. It doesn't matter. And then I had to like wait
01:02:29 like half an hour in real time. I tried restarting it. You don't get to fight him again. You have to
01:02:34 wait real time for him to reappear in this sub menu to fight him again. And I'm just saying,
01:02:40 I don't think the game did a good enough job of showing me what I had to do to unlock this character
01:02:44 and it pissed me off. And that's why I'm mad. That's such a weird Nintendo smash thing to do,
01:02:52 to take the conceit that was kind of cool and just run so far with it that it goes around to
01:02:58 being weird and baffling. And like, I like the idea of having to unlock all the characters,
01:03:05 because when I was younger, that used to be what I saw as like your goal in a fighting game. It's
01:03:10 like, yeah, there's a bunch of open slots. I want to fill those. That's the, that's the, if you're
01:03:16 somebody who only plays a fighting game for like a week after it comes out, you know, like a regular
01:03:20 video game, then that's pretty much what you do. And with smash on melee, like I had the strategy
01:03:27 guide, there were a lot of guys that took a lot of effort to get because it was either you had to
01:03:32 do something really difficult or you had to play a certain number of hours or a certain number of
01:03:36 matches. And like to get everybody, you'd have to play like 1000 rounds in order to get the hardest
01:03:44 to get character. So, you know, hearing that you had to unlock everybody in the new game was really
01:03:49 cool, although I also heard it was like really easy. But then in order to mitigate it being too
01:03:54 easy, they put in like a weird mechanic that makes it like, oh, well, now I'm just waiting around,
01:03:59 and I can't do anything to expedite making this happen. I can't just get better and beat the
01:04:06 challenge that I was stuck on. I just have to wait, you know? Yeah, I mean, you can play through
01:04:12 World of Light to get them, but like that, that's like a 40 hour gauntlet, basically, from what I
01:04:16 understand to get everybody there. Maybe it's a little faster than that, if you know what you're
01:04:20 doing, but I certainly didn't. I don't know. You know what? I'm not that upset about it, frankly.
01:04:25 I just thought it was weird that it was like tucked off in this side menu to unlock them,
01:04:29 and it was very strange. But you know, I literally like and am glad that some people are getting
01:04:34 fucked and they don't know how to unlock, and they're confused and scared. I like this. I like
01:04:39 this, that people are traumatized. Because like, remember Mortal Kombat back in the day or whatever,
01:04:44 where like, you get you got fucking, I don't know, Sub-Zero and what's the fire guy, you know,
01:04:50 the fire Sub-Zero? Scorpion. Bowser. Scorpion, yes, thank you. The fire guy. I'm sorry. But like,
01:04:56 then you got like, I think, I think just Scorpion was unlocked to begin with. Like, you have to like
01:05:00 figure out how to unlock Sub-Zero. And then it's like, oh my god, I think there's like a green one
01:05:05 two, what the fuck? And then you unlock fucking Reptile. And then there's like a gray one two,
01:05:10 who I can't remember, like Fog or something. Smoke. Smoke. Fog? Really? Fog, whatever. Okay,
01:05:16 I'm sorry. It's like, Jesus Christ, there's a gray one. I can unlock this guy. What the fuck do I
01:05:21 need to do? I guess I just missed the mystery, you know, of the olden days. Before I was an old
01:05:26 jaded fuck, who knew too much about video games. I remember unlocking all the characters in Soul
01:05:30 Calibur and like, fucking... Fucking Yoda. Fucking, what's the other, what's another good game?
01:05:39 Tekken. Yeah, King, I don't know, Dead or Alive. I never fucking played Dead or Alive. That's
01:05:45 another one I was thinking. That one wasn't about secret characters, but getting extra costumes
01:05:50 for all the characters. You got to unlock the booby sliders. You can just pump them all up to
01:05:54 max. That's the way. Oh, you know what? I was thinking like, I don't, I can't relate to this
01:06:01 because I've never played a fighting game enough to unlock characters, but I do remember
01:06:05 in Rayman M, Rayman Arena, you can, you can unlock skins for like Rayman and Glowbox and stuff
01:06:12 by playing loads of levels and completing different challenges. And I did enjoy... That's fun.
01:06:16 That's cool. Completing all of those. Kind of like that in the city too, but you know what,
01:06:20 actually now I think about, in Dead or Alive, I distinctly remember, I think we were playing
01:06:24 Dead or Alive 3, me and my boys on his like Xbox or something, we had heard that like there were
01:06:30 tricks to get nude cheat codes in Dead or Alive. So I remember playing that game extensively and like
01:06:37 doing deep dark web internet, you know, searching, trying to, trying to get big old Kazumi titties
01:06:44 out or, you know, you know where that came from, right? Do you remember? No, where? That was from
01:06:49 the pages of Electronic Gaming Monthly, that was their April Fool's joke for that year. Oh,
01:06:54 fuck! Yeah, the screenshots in there were photoshopped. Oh my god, that's literally
01:07:01 not acceptable. The year before that, they photoshopped Sonic and Tails being unlockable
01:07:06 characters in Melee and the whole world went insane for a while.
01:07:13 Literal fake news. Shut them down. They have to... That was the thing because like GamePro had like a
01:07:18 fake insert of like joke articles, but EGM just slid something in there that was just plausible
01:07:24 enough to piss everybody else off, and that was their expert troll. So yeah. You know, I like
01:07:30 that a lot, I like that a lot, but that is cruel to do to children who just want to see big anime
01:07:34 titties, goddammit. I just want to see big anime titties with Sonic the Hedgehog. Well, the internet
01:07:42 has some places for you, my friend. That's true. That's true. Okay, I'll go to tumblr.com. Oh, no.
01:07:49 Oh, no. Where am I going to get my Sonic anime titties now? That's a good question. I wonder what
01:07:54 the future has in store for Tumblr. Hey, have you guys heard about the... Okay, this is actually
01:08:00 fascinating and hilarious. With the shutting down of Tumblr's NSFW shit, the refugees from
01:08:08 Tumblr are flooding like Twitter and other places, and have you heard that as a consequence of like
01:08:14 a light being shown and all the cockroaches scattering from inside Tumblr, things like the map,
01:08:20 the minor attracted persons or whatever, are making little communities outside of Tumblr?
01:08:26 This is hilarious. The degeneracy is being exposed, and it's like becoming a minor attracted person.
01:08:34 Wasn't that what fucking Clegg called himself? I think so, yeah. I think so. It would give this
01:08:41 like a minor attracted person, aka literally just a pedophile, like who advocates. I mean, they say,
01:08:46 you know, like, yeah. They're trying to rebrand? I mean, that's for a while. That seems to be the
01:08:53 option when shit goes south of PR. That's true. It's kind of funny that we're even playing along
01:08:59 with that. I mean, we call it, because if they call themselves the map community, then it's like,
01:09:04 well, I guess that's what they're called, but I mean, yeah, it literally is just a word that
01:09:09 means the same thing as pedophiles. It's just for pedophiles. There's a thing for no contact maps,
01:09:17 you know? I'm like, okay, good. That's good. But man, this is just... The fact that this was just
01:09:26 going on... I wouldn't trust somebody who says, oh, yeah, I'm no contact rapist. Okay, I believe you.
01:09:35 Yeah, good. You can stay at my house. I don't know, man. This is like, there's these little pockets
01:09:44 where like, I mean, for example, there's like, when 4chaners like leave 4chan and go act the
01:09:51 same way they do on 4chan elsewhere, you know, there's slapback. There's like, well, you can't
01:09:56 behave that way here, sir. We don't do things that way. And it's like, okay, fair enough. But it's
01:10:00 just so funny to me that all this degeneracy going on there, when it's brought other places,
01:10:07 suddenly there's a spotlight on it. Yeah. It was just going wrong. Are these people confused and
01:10:14 surprised that they're getting backlash because of the they've stayed on Tumblr for so long? This is
01:10:18 the fascinating thing. Shu on head made a video about it and I've seen, I've heard about it for a
01:10:22 while. But like, there's a legit attempt being made by these individuals to hitch their wagon to the
01:10:29 LGBTQ plus like wagon because like, it is true. I guess it's fair to say, and I do feel for people,
01:10:38 they didn't choose to be born a map, I guess. So okay, that's fair, I guess. But there remains
01:10:46 a distinction here, I think, between, you know, the ability to consent and not the ability to consent.
01:10:53 Like, if you're a necrophile, for example, like, I frankly think that's not such a terrible thing
01:10:59 to be. It's obviously not really a great lifestyle. But like, in no way are you really a threat to
01:11:04 anyone. In terms of, I think, I think there's, I mean, yeah, at some point, you've just got to
01:11:12 realize that like, sex is not actually that important to one's lifestyle. Like you, if maps,
01:11:20 like, whatever, pedophiles, they can't help being attracted to younger people. I can imagine that
01:11:28 that is true. But like, you just have to go without. There's no way around it, you just can't do it.
01:11:36 You know what, this is the thing, like, okay, I kind of get the argument that like, hey, like, stop,
01:11:43 like, I don't know, what, bullying us, being mean to us, because like, we didn't choose this. So like,
01:11:47 I get the connection there, and I'm not trying to conflate this with any, you know, like, sexuality,
01:11:51 whatever, like, being gay or whatever. That's obviously a different thing. But it's like,
01:11:55 I legitimately feel bad for people like this, and they don't get to choose it. And it kind of makes
01:12:01 sense that there could be people saying like, hey, man, we didn't choose to be this way. We don't
01:12:06 deserve to be hurt. We haven't hurt anybody. Like, I get it. But I'm not advocating for them to be
01:12:12 bullied. I just feel like you've got to realize that you can't, you can't be protected with having
01:12:19 this thing. There is no way to be a good. No, we have to imagine the other way. We have to imagine,
01:12:24 let's say, that we give total acceptance to the pedophiles. And in fact, the government's like,
01:12:30 we feel for you guys, you can't help who you're attracted to. And it's not fair that you have
01:12:34 to go your whole lives penalized and not able to have sex with anybody. So we're going to cover you
01:12:40 guys. We got you government mandated lollies. So you just round up, no, you just round up a bunch
01:12:48 of like orphan girls who've got, you know, what the fuck. And these girls are going to die in the
01:12:57 streets anyways. So we're just giving them the pedophiles as a prize. This is justice, ladies
01:13:05 and gentlemen. No, dude. I got it. I got it. 3D printed silicone lollies. That way nobody gets
01:13:10 hurt. And it's very funny. That's good. They can't hear about that. You're just fucking a doll. But
01:13:16 I mean, good. I guess, I mean, you could already do that. You could already just go and get a real
01:13:20 doll that looks like a little girl. They have those. You know, like, some people... Where did
01:13:26 you? Where can I find them? Just Google real doll. I hear that they're like being banned in places.
01:13:32 I don't know. Like, I get the idea. That's dumb. That's really dumb to ban them. I was looking at
01:13:37 real doll websites before because I wanted to know what all the different types are and shit and
01:13:42 like what even because they're fucking fascinating. And the ones that are like smaller, they refer
01:13:50 to them as travel size. Okay. Well, like on the plane, you just get them out. No, they're like,
01:13:57 oh, this one like can be taken with you because it's only like three and a half feet tall. So it's
01:14:03 just, you know, just, you know, it's a three and a half foot tall facsimile of a human girl.
01:14:08 Air gun. It looks like a little, like it looks like a child, you know? You know what would be
01:14:12 interesting? An interesting experiment, though. If someone could do a study of this, it's like,
01:14:16 okay, you just take like the same like document or style or like doll thing or whatever, like the
01:14:23 design is the same and you have one that's like, I don't know, five foot five and one that's like,
01:14:28 like, I don't know, like four feet or whatever, like child size, like the design is the same. There
01:14:34 are no differences. It is simply the size and like one's labeled travel size and one's just labeled
01:14:39 normal. Like would people have an issue with that? I assume they would. I assume they would
01:14:45 when in actuality, there's no, nothing is really being implied or anything with that, you know?
01:14:50 It's just a difference of size. It's just like getting to own a physical version of when you
01:14:54 imagine your girlfriend what she looked like when she was like 14 while you're having sex with her,
01:14:59 you know? Well, I mean, I could understand people having an objection to that, I suppose, but yeah,
01:15:05 I mean, I've thought about, I've talked about this before. It's like, I remember when I was 12,
01:15:09 and I was way into Nina Mori from Fooley Cooley. And like, what am I going to pretend that I
01:15:14 like don't have a memory for that? I'm thinking about this. Like, I'm thinking that if you made
01:15:19 a doll of like, like that looked just like a real little girl, it would probably be seen as like
01:15:24 hyper illegal and not okay. But if you made a doll that looked like a younger version of a woman
01:15:30 who is of age now, would that be illegal or questionable to people? I mean, their parents
01:15:36 would probably be fucking weirded out. Everybody would be weirded out. Everybody on earth would
01:15:41 be weirded out by this. By the way, the question is where is the line? I'm very, I'm just, I'm just
01:15:48 no. I mean, the line is and always should be at real people. Right? Well, it doesn't matter.
01:15:55 This is a person who was real at some point. I mean, and now they're dead. Like, I mean, I get
01:16:02 the through line that like, okay, this person's attracted to like the facsimile of an actual
01:16:07 child doesn't matter that they're older now, they used to be. And like that's like, I get the connection
01:16:11 there. I mean, I'm not even asking if it's right or wrong. I'm just asking like, would yeah, like
01:16:15 if you made a doll of a real little girl, it would definitely be not okay, like legally, you know,
01:16:21 well, sure. But if it was like of a girl who is of age, and you were doing a doll like what she
01:16:25 looked like at a younger age, I don't think that makes a difference. I think people would still
01:16:30 be upset. I think that they're equitable. It all depends on like people finding out. If they find
01:16:35 out that you have a sex doll that raised eyebrows already true. And then the fact that it's young
01:16:41 is like, Oh, well, it's okay. So it's of his wife as a girl, like that nobody's gonna say that.
01:16:47 But like, okay, what about this other thing though, that's like, in Australia or wherever,
01:16:51 I always, whatever. So somewhere this is true, that like, if you have like women who have a
01:16:56 petite build, they are not allowed to do porn, even if they're fucking 35. Yeah, because they
01:17:01 just like so. So now we've got that thrown in. So that's pretty weird. So now it's,
01:17:06 I guess it's just about the appearance and nothing else.
01:17:10 Weird guys, I don't know. Let's go. Yeah, you got it. There you go.
01:17:16 Shall we move on to voicemails, please? God save me. Okay, let's do it. Let's do it.
01:17:23 Let me let me pull it up. Everybody. Let me wait. No, I'm going to do it right this time.
01:17:28 Speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemails, right, Tom? Yes, you did it. Is it doesn't have an s at the
01:17:38 end? Is it voicemails voicemail voicemail? Okay, so I'm still wrong. Oh, you got it wrong. Fail.
01:17:43 You said voicemails. I did. Well, you were close. I'll take back those claps, but I don't know what
01:17:49 the sound is. I'm clapping right now. It doesn't make any noise, but okay, I feel the pain though.
01:17:55 Okay, first one. Here we go. This is from definitely not one spar. Let's see what he's got today.
01:18:04 Shot it. Now I was thinking back on my voicemail from last week and I realized I definitely didn't
01:18:09 have as good a time listening to it as I remember having recording it. Now you guys know good old
01:18:14 one spar. If there's one thing I could certainly use more of, it's male genitalia. And if there's
01:18:20 another thing, it's constructive criticism. But before I go anywhere with that, I just want to
01:18:24 say shame on you, PCP, for making fun of my accent. I know my audio quality was significantly worse
01:18:30 than usual. That wasn't him, right? We're being beamed. Just awful. But that one was a bit of a dirty
01:18:35 shot. Anyways, back to my personal shortcomings. First of all, I should have known better than
01:18:40 to ask a specific question like how can I be more gay without even knowing whether or not Digi or
01:18:44 Hippo would even be on. I mean, that's just a beginner's mistake. I did also realize that I
01:18:49 spent most of my question rehashing the same joke, which I guess was just referencing my sexual
01:18:54 preferences. I don't know. It doesn't seem like my strongest entry to date. But let me know what
01:18:58 you guys think. And if you see any more one spars running around, please feel free to destroy them
01:19:02 because like my stalemate Hans and Jerome from the Glory Hole convention told me, no one likes a
01:19:08 biter. See you next week, guys. Oh, that was a great ending gag. Yeah. One spar is he's really
01:19:16 evolving the medium here. He's really moving us forward. I am confused. But what wait, was there
01:19:23 a question? Okay, last week, we got a question from someone who I think was I forget what they're
01:19:28 saying their names, but their name was like definitely one spar, I think was it. And they just
01:19:32 went on about how they can be more gay. And they like had an accent that we thought was weird.
01:19:37 So I think we're so it's someone who who knows one spar and was trying to be funny. That's probably
01:19:41 true. That's probably true. Or maybe he just was Asian for a day, or whatever that accent was.
01:19:47 Maybe he was gay for a day. Oh, shit. What do I do? People will get that eventually someday.
01:19:54 This mystery rag. No, never, never. No, I was promised much. He promised it's coming. I'm
01:20:00 waiting for it. I made a vow or a bet or whatever. So we'll see. You did. Okay. Anyway, next one's
01:20:07 from Centerpoint. Let's see what Centerpoint's got for us. Tell us your favorite Christmas story.
01:20:15 Whimsical, delightful, filled with blood and violence. Epic. Yeah, favorite. It's getting
01:20:23 close to the Christmas season, people. I want to put this in to get us in the mood. It's time
01:20:27 to deck the halls and you know, I don't really have a good like Christmas story that's like
01:20:33 unique to a specific year. But there was one time when it snowed a lot and I think I may have
01:20:39 talked about this before on the PCP, but a long time ago, where it snowed a lot and me and my
01:20:44 brothers went down to the park and there was snow in the park and we rolled a snowball together,
01:20:53 all three of us, around the park and it was it was just got really big. It just went downhill.
01:21:00 It just got really, really big. It was like three meters tall by the end and we couldn't move it
01:21:04 anymore. And then people went up to it and like, well, dude, look, check this out. And they took
01:21:09 selfies with it. Dude, that was the coolest snow time in the snow that was really big.
01:21:18 Hippopotamus, the snow that was really big. Hippopotamus, the snow that was really big.
01:21:24 Yeah. You know, one time a little Nate woke up on Christmas morning and ran downstairs to find
01:21:32 a beautiful, shiny new pair of Jordans of sweet kicks. They were red and black and white and
01:21:39 they were pristine and I put them on and just felt like so happy and content with the world. I
01:21:43 was running around jumping and feeling great, filled with a Christmas spirit. Nate, why do I
01:21:47 feel like I never see you wearing those shoes anymore if you loved me so much? Well, because
01:21:51 you see, then something happened. A dark shadow began looming over me from the distance who
01:21:56 pushed me down and ripped the shoes off my feet and he pulled them on himself and then he said,
01:22:01 haha, Nate, I, Ben Saint, I'm stealing your shoes. I have no justification to be doing this. I have no
01:22:08 moral right to do this, but I'm doing it anyway like I will steal your dollars at patreon.com
01:22:14 slash Ben Saint for the shittiest quality of content. And that's the story of literally how
01:22:20 I lost my shoes in real life to Ben on Christmas. He is a monster. Don't support him. Give it all
01:22:28 to me instead. That's my Christmas story. Oh, it gets me in the Christmas spirit every time
01:22:33 I think about that cruel, vicious blows that Ben reigned upon me. We're stealing my chopping off
01:22:39 my feet with your own sneakers. Okay, that's all I got. I don't have any good Christmas stories,
01:22:49 but I did start making up my own Christmases at some point. So my family was just like,
01:22:55 eh, Christmas, whatever. So one year I was like, hey, let's do Festivus, which is a thing in
01:23:02 Seinfeld, the Christmas for the rest of us. And it's, it's just you do a bunch of silly
01:23:10 shit. You have like a pole instead of a Christmas tree. You eat lasagna and you have an airing of
01:23:15 grievances and yet the rest of the head of the family. It's a fun time. And then like the next
01:23:20 year I started making up my own holidays. So then we did a, we did one called agarwood day where I
01:23:27 themed it around the lyrics of agalodge songs. That's pretty fucking nerdy. And then it was the
01:23:33 hearth's warming eve where I did the My Little Pony holiday with a bunch of just basically a bunch
01:23:38 of events themed around the stuff that happens in the episode of the show. And there's a video about
01:23:45 Oh yeah, we would do, we would do like different things throughout the day. Like there might be
01:23:50 like a scavenger hunt or a fucking big luncheon of some sort. You know, that's pretty cool. I mean,
01:23:58 that's a lot more work and thought than most people put into it. Um, yeah, it's good. It's
01:24:03 cause like generally I've always been like unable to sleep before any kind of major holiday. So I
01:24:08 would just stay up all night and set shit up until morning. That's all right. Hey, that's,
01:24:12 that's constructive. You know, I've been dreaming about apple cider that one time my cousin, I
01:24:18 think cousin Maddie came over and I was like, Hey, let's make some apple cider. And so we did.
01:24:22 And that it's like, it's just apple cider with fireball whiskey. And I think like with like,
01:24:27 we made like cinnamon, um, sugar like crust for like, you know how you make that like the top of
01:24:32 your glass with like the sugar crystals or whatever you like dip it in. Oh my God. It was
01:24:36 like the most delicious drink I've ever had in my life. I've been dreaming about it for years and
01:24:40 I never made it again. Uh, I'd highly recommend it to everybody out there to drink on Christmas day.
01:24:46 Make this drink. It is so good. I'm just going to go over it again because you should do this
01:24:50 because it's so good. Just get some apple cider, fireball whiskey, and then look up a recipe for
01:24:55 like cinnamon and like sugar topping on like the rim of your glass. You will love it. Oh,
01:25:00 and you got to cook it in like a crock pot thing. You just like, you just warm up the drinks in a
01:25:04 crock pot, uh, the fireball and the apple cider. It's so good. It's my favorite. Nothing's better.
01:25:10 And it's so please play another fucking voicemail. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Anyway, let's move
01:25:15 on. Next one's from, uh, Cluster Punk Kitchen. Hey, go. English muffin in the toaster.
01:25:22 Butter that shit up. Yeah. Arrange six cheesy Doritos in the center. Press it down. Hear the
01:25:31 crunch. That's your lunch. Take a bite. Change your life. You just learned how to make an English
01:25:41 Doritos sandwich on today's episode of Cluster Punk Kitchen. Hell yeah. Now you're cooking with
01:25:56 what the fuck? That was amazing. Thank you. Cluster Punk Kitchen. Damn. Uh, I'm going to try
01:26:00 that next week's episode. Speaking of cooking recipes and shit. Um, damn. Finally, finally,
01:26:05 some quality programming to replace poor boy eats. I've been waiting forever. Oh yeah.
01:26:11 Poor boy eats was legendary, though. I want another episode. One of these days,
01:26:15 Radcon 4, maybe? This voicemail gives me ideas of having, you know, how like in
01:26:21 just stealing that idea and making that a show we do live action. Well, no, no. Like having people
01:26:27 do ad breaks, but for the PCP, like how you did and how they marketed. Yeah, that'd be great.
01:26:34 Okay. Next one's from Mr. Upload. Uh, let's hear what he's got.
01:26:38 I got a question from Nate. What is your favorite Stanley Kubrick movie? Because I know
01:26:46 you mentioned and other episodes, 2001 Space Odyssey and The Shining. And I'm pretty curious.
01:26:54 Yep. This is just my chance to gush about Kubrick because I love him so much.
01:26:59 Okay, that's fine. He's normal question. I'm like kind of confused. I know it's weird, right? Uh,
01:27:05 my favorite Kubrick movie is probably The Shining, but I absolutely love Doctor Strange Love is a
01:27:12 masterpiece. Everyone should watch it. Uh, Eyes Wide Shut is a masterpiece. Everyone should watch it
01:27:17 as The Shining. Um, oh, fucking, what's the other one? Um, uh, the first half, I was just watching
01:27:25 a ton of Full Metal Jacket. The second half is good, but the first half is better. Um, and there's
01:27:33 other stuff, but I forget, but he's just the best. Everything he's made is gold. Highly recommended
01:27:38 across the board. Um, okay, that's it. I'm looking at, I'm looking at the list. Yeah. And I think
01:27:44 the only one I've actually watched all the way through is Full Metal Jacket. The other ones were
01:27:48 just on TV and I was like, oh, what's this? My dude, do yourself a favor and watch The Shining.
01:27:53 It is the best movie. It is the spookiest movie. God, it's so good. Everything. Kubrick is just,
01:28:00 he is that guy. He is that bitch. He went there. He's not afraid to go there. Um, okay, let's go
01:28:06 on to the next one here. This is from Moon Jew. From Moon Jew. Big, big, big friend of the show.
01:28:13 Let's see where he has to stay. Big. All right, Nate, bud, this one's for you. All right. I'm
01:28:19 recording this the day after Smash came out at midnight and I am so fucking hyped and I cannot
01:28:27 explain to you just how badly your ass is going to get beaten. Your next stream, I swear to God,
01:28:34 my camera will fucking demolish you. No matter what character you play, I fucking destroy you.
01:28:41 So get your lube ready because I'm ready to fuck you in the ass.
01:28:48 Um, is that, is that another Smash, Smash, uh, stream, uh, ad for, for Nate?
01:28:55 Maybe a little bit. Maybe a little bit. Uh, I just put that in there to, to, in case I didn't
01:28:59 say it before, to, I don't think I did. I feel public service announcement. Uh, I made a bunch
01:29:03 of Smash videos. I'm a huge fan. The, the thing is though, um, actually shit. Uh, so I feel like
01:29:10 I've misled people a little bit into thinking that fighting me would like be interesting or
01:29:15 challenging or fun. I mean, I put up a good fight against Nate. Tom beat me every time except once.
01:29:22 Yeah. Um, and it was on a gimmicky bullshit stage. Yeah, that's true.
01:29:27 I, I, it's, it's, it's strange cause like I don't feel that hype about Smash because of,
01:29:33 of how bad I am at it. Okay. I'm divorced from that. Interesting. I was talking about this on
01:29:37 the stream. Is that like, I don't like Smash at all. I find the mechanics, the mechanics are good.
01:29:43 I don't like the controls. I don't like the lack of flow, but then I played little Mac who's all
01:29:47 about just heavy single hits and I'm like, this character makes sense for the control. So I almost,
01:29:53 I almost, almost kind of like Smash now just because of little Mac. Well, all right. Almost.
01:30:00 Yeah. I mean, we were talking about this on the stream that like with fighting games, it's really
01:30:04 about like whether or not you like the game is going to depend on if you find a character that
01:30:08 you can play. Yeah. You know, um, like that's the reason I never have gotten too into street
01:30:14 fighter is like the only character I'm okay with is Kami. And all I really do is like spam the same
01:30:20 couple of attacks. I don't know how to like play her on like a technical level. So like in a fighting
01:30:26 game like Smash, where you can use such a huge variety of different techniques and how you want
01:30:31 to play the game, depending on who you're using, like just because I found a way to play Samus,
01:30:36 that works for me. That's why I will go back to Smash. But like as soon as I have to venture
01:30:41 outside of Samus, the game is significantly less interesting and less depending on the game. Like
01:30:47 in Smash four, I really liked playing as Ganondorf. So it made the game fun again. But like I wasn't
01:30:53 good enough at it or playing him to like, you know, consistently beat my friends. So it's like
01:30:59 ultimately I, if I'm having a good time, it's because I'm playing Samus and winning a lot.
01:31:04 And then people get sick of losing to you. And then the game is not fun anymore. And that's a
01:31:08 Smash session. Yeah, more or less. Luckily, you've got a new Echo fighter to mess around with,
01:31:14 being a Dark Samus, just like a variant of Samus. Incidentally, you said you played
01:31:21 Kami? Camille Toe? Okay, moving on to the next voice. Thank you. Here we go. You're welcome.
01:31:28 Terrible. So hello there, procrastinators. This is your old ass boy who said that you were my role
01:31:33 models. You all sucked. And I have no friends. Well, two things, you know, actually suck. And I
01:31:39 got new friends. They were fun for like two weeks, because I told them that Pokemon Go was great.
01:31:44 And it was fun. But then they got bored and said it was gay or some shit. After that, I realized
01:31:51 just how unintellectual those people actually are. I was arguing with them all day, every day,
01:31:56 just to understand where they're coming from. Still still don't understand. They got mad at me
01:32:01 for some reason. So I don't have any friends once again. But the point is, the best guy from the
01:32:07 group messaged me after the incident and told me that he has completed Homestuck and he's now gay.
01:32:16 My question is, what the fuck? What? Homestuck? How did Homestuck turn him gay? Is this real?
01:32:24 Well, what the fuck? To be fair, you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand Pokemon Go.
01:32:31 Yeah, that's true. To be fair, you have to be a pretty high gay gene. To be turned gay by Homestuck.
01:32:38 I mean, this is the guy who the other day, if people remember, which is like, guys, I'm literally
01:32:46 too intellectual to talk to these people and make quote unquote friends with them. It sounds like
01:32:55 he gave in, finally did make friends with them and then fucked it up immediately somehow.
01:33:00 That's what it sounds like. I mean, I mean, he said there was an incident. So yeah, what was the
01:33:05 incident? Unless you beat the shit out of somebody. And even then, I don't think it's like completely
01:33:14 a lost cause. Did you ever have friends growing up who were on paper? You'd think you'd get along
01:33:20 with them, right? Because they like the same shit as you, but they just were annoying and not fun to
01:33:26 hang around for one of many reasons. Maybe they're just like, they're really nitpicky. Maybe they,
01:33:33 you know, try to correct you a lot and it's just kind of wears on your patience.
01:33:36 I knew a kid who was exactly like that in elementary school and in high school,
01:33:41 he tried to shoot up the school and is now in prison. Maybe that's our voicemail caller here
01:33:47 today. This is his future as well. I would say, dude, look a little more inward. I would guess
01:33:53 the problem is you. I'm just saying pragmatically, even if you're like the greatest person in the
01:33:57 world, this is not an objective like good versus bad thing, right? If other people are forming
01:34:03 friendships and they're getting along, but you're not able to, I would say that there's something
01:34:08 you got to change. I mean, that was a joke though of his call, right? Like he was trying to imply
01:34:13 that it was him because he's being like an elitist. Was he? I mean, I don't know because he made a
01:34:19 similar call before and I just assume that he's relatively serious about this. The fact that
01:34:24 he's shitting on them for being like so unintelligent comes off kind of cartoon-y. That's gotta be,
01:34:29 that's a joke for sure. I'm curious about the homestuck thing. Does he, when he said, his friend
01:34:37 called him and said, I finished homestuck and now I'm gay. Now I'm gay. I think he's messing with
01:34:41 that. Obviously, that's not like homosexuality. I'm just thinking like does he dislike homestuck?
01:34:49 Or is this good for him? Is this one of the guys from his friend? I took it at face value and assumed
01:34:53 that his friend had been like gay and didn't recognize it in himself until he read homestuck
01:34:59 and like related to Dirk super hard and was like, oh my god, I'm fucking gay. Yeah, maybe that's what
01:35:05 it is. I can see that happening. Okay, next call. This is from Steve Help Me Saint. Okay, go.
01:35:16 Upon hearing Munchie's clarification last podcast that Ben St is in fact a real boy,
01:35:21 I felt like I had to be pragmatic about this and test it. So I took Nate's advice. I stared into my
01:35:25 I stared into my bathroom mirror, my eyes milky and bloodshot as I chugged three pints of heavy
01:35:30 cream and went into a keto induced coma and didn't wake up for three days. But when I did
01:35:35 woke up, I was sprawled out on the ground like a sweaty beast. But you know who was there? Ben,
01:35:40 haven't showered in three months fucking saint. He was staring at me, sipping my fucking heavy
01:35:46 cream again that he stole from my fridge. A devilish grin etched into his sunken face. He
01:35:52 stole my heavy cream just like he stole Nate's shoes. He's just a thief. He snapped the fingers
01:35:57 on his right hand. Boom. All the food in my house that wasn't keto friendly. Gone. He snapped the
01:36:02 fingers on his left on his other hand. I put my bank account. Gone. Why are you the page on
01:36:07 dot com slash ben saint? That's page on dot com slash ben saint. I can't live like this when I
01:36:11 he's haunting me when I try to fall asleep. All I can hear in the background is in the distance
01:36:16 is a can of monster zero popping open. Every time I try to fall asleep, I don't know what to do. I
01:36:22 really like Ben St, but I can't live with him haunting me Munchie anyone. Can you give me a
01:36:25 keto exorcism? Can someone help me? Also, I really like that just has been on the podcast
01:36:30 again recently because I really like him and he's like best boy. Thanks. Yeah, that's that's great.
01:36:35 That's great. I think I look I've been trying to rid myself of the Ben St demon for for 28
01:36:40 years. All you have to do is all you have to do is bread all the meat in your house.
01:36:45 Yeah. Yeah, just bread that means read that much ketoing power. So you just keep keep hitting him
01:36:51 with the non keto shit. He will overload. Here's my here's my tried and true method.
01:36:57 Schedule everything and he will always schedule everything in your life and do it on time because
01:37:04 he won't be there on time. And then you're in the clear and then you're in the clear.
01:37:09 He'll always be 10. I mean, if you think about it, he showed up late because you were in a coma
01:37:13 for days and woke up and that's when he was there. So that's true. That's true. I think we found
01:37:18 is one weakness, the way to cut through. Okay, next one. Okay, this is an important call everybody.
01:37:24 This is from this is called Reclamato Reclamato. We talked about Clemato juice.
01:37:30 Clemato is disgusting. Let's let's hear what he's got. Okay, so the guy who is asking about
01:37:37 Clemato juice as an clamato, not clamato. It's it's it's tomato juice. It's not there's no clam in it.
01:37:47 Oh, my white person. What are you doing? What it is is like a margarita. You add fucking tomato
01:37:54 and shitty beer. It's like you're drinking healthy shit, but you get to get drunk on shitty Mexican
01:37:59 beer. He's wrong. Clemato is clam and tomato. Don't ever say clamato again. It makes me it
01:38:05 fucking it hurts my client Mexican. It's not just a beer. It's like a it's like a thing that's consumed
01:38:11 as a regular drink. Is that okay? Maybe there's like different varieties or something.
01:38:16 I thought it was like a clam tornado. Okay. Clemato is a commercial drink made of reconstituted
01:38:23 tomato juice concentrate and sugar, which is flavored with spices and clam broth. Okay, so it's
01:38:28 called Clemato because it has clam in it. This guy has no idea what he's fucking talking about.
01:38:32 This guy is a little off base. Sounds like the facts are on it. So I don't listen to a white
01:38:36 people about a Mexican drink. Obviously, this guy is Mexican now. So I guess he's
01:38:41 all right. I'm confused as to why this is being advertised as a drink and not a soup.
01:38:46 It is a drink. It comes in a can. Soup can come in a can. It's fucking disgusting. It's really
01:38:52 gross. It tastes like drinking tomato juice mixed with clam. I like the idea of like a clam and
01:38:59 tomato soup, but like that sounds good. A drink. Yeah, like a refreshing drink like I wouldn't
01:39:05 call it refreshing. It's odd. So it's like he was doing a little he was putting a little
01:39:11 panache on that. We put a little spice on it called the Clemato. Clemato juice, right? So that's
01:39:17 I mean, it is they do make beers that are like Clemato beers. I had one on on a fucking
01:39:26 the beer alcohol on Sundays show I did. It was the fucking disgusting. I had to like spit it out.
01:39:32 I couldn't drink it. All right, we'll shit alcohol on Sundays as well as some other ones of
01:39:38 the of that of the series are just great names. I really like like unironically enjoy alcohol
01:39:44 on Sundays as a name. I got that from a skit that's in AMV hell three where Shinji is on the phone.
01:39:52 It's like the clip of Shinji on the phone and episode one of Eva on the payphone and like
01:39:57 this guy's running through all these like options of what he can click on on like the button. So
01:40:02 it's like if you're out of alcohol on Sundays, press five. If you need a hoe for the evening,
01:40:07 press six. If you woke up with a hangover and a pair of sweaty balls on your forehead, press seven.
01:40:13 And deep lore show. So alcohol on Sundays comes from that. I because in a lot of places you can't
01:40:19 buy alcohol on Sundays. Since why? Yeah, yeah. All right, well, let's go to our next call here
01:40:25 from the worst guy ever or possibly H four hot boy. I guess that's also his name. Do it.
01:40:34 Nate, it is me from the deepest darkest pits of the deepest blackest hell. Your tithesis,
01:40:41 the worst guy ever. Can't be. I've come here to tell your general audience. No, a success is bad.
01:40:51 Don't pursue success ever. You be gay and be that your dreams are dumb and that you
01:40:58 shouldn't try to do any of them ever because they're all going to fail.
01:41:05 Now that I blew built your audience, there's nothing you can do to stop me.
01:41:10 Oh, yeah, munchies gay,
01:41:23 which I assume is a resounding endorsement from the worst guy ever to say something's gay.
01:41:27 Nate, have you listened to the latest Andrew WK album?
01:41:32 No, I don't think so. You should check it out because it's basically it's the most like life
01:41:37 affirming motivational music imaginable. And all of it is basically after hearing
01:41:42 Fantana's review, I would describe it as music about finding inner greatness through sheer force
01:41:48 of believing that you will find inner greatness. Okay, just believing in yourself so hard that you
01:41:55 just do everything because you just believe that you can do anything. What's the name of that album?
01:42:00 I don't remember the singles called music is worth living for.
01:42:06 What fascinated me about that was I listened to Fantana's review of it and I haven't listened
01:42:11 to much of WK's music in the past. I know you and Jesse are fans, but the way he described it was
01:42:18 that there was an evolution of the concept. Originally, Andrew WK was the party guy,
01:42:24 like the party never stops, party every day, etc. But now he's adapting this party every day formula
01:42:30 to a lifestyle of like the party is light. That's what his thing is because it was that
01:42:37 from the beginning really that was the idea of the party was that he approaches it as
01:42:45 not literal, but that at all times he's having a party. There's a lot of reference to the idea of
01:42:51 partying primarily by yourself. Most of what his parties are is him by himself finding the inner
01:42:59 strength to have fun and consider all moments a party. He used to tweet constantly about what is
01:43:06 a party. He would say things like just pissed on my hand, life is beautiful, hashtag party.
01:43:13 Goddamn. That's dope, that's dope. It's like, yeah man, wake up, go to your nine to five,
01:43:20 that's a fucking party. Come home, change the baby's dirty diaper, make it a fucking party,
01:43:25 dude. I concluded that it is the ultimate bloomer music and it really sounds like one
01:43:33 rung away from being Christian Rock. That album in particular, it's so sappy and over the top and
01:43:42 cathartic and almost religious sounding that it's Christian Rock for people who are too edgy to be
01:43:49 into Christian Rock, basically. That sounds good, I'll have to check it out. Okay, last call here
01:43:56 from, this is from, this is called Racist Forest Gump Finale, so this sounds like a big one, let's
01:44:02 brace ourselves. Johnny, it's finally time to put an end to all of this. Not far as what are you
01:44:11 gonna do? I'm gonna say the end word. No, stop, there's still time. Neon Genesis is about to get it.
01:44:25 Oh my god, he did it.
01:44:27 Nice. Boris, Boris, that's three words. Shut the fuck up.
01:44:42 Johnny, blow the fuck out. God damn. Oh shit. Thank you very much for joining me on Racist Forest Gump.
01:44:52 I'd like to thank the podcast players for hosting this. I got to thank God, Netflix for sponsoring
01:44:59 this episode and God bless the world, thank you to the economy, thank you to God, thank you to Jesus,
01:45:06 thank you to the idiot piano and thank you to all of you, you've been a wonderful audience.
01:45:13 It's been an honor.
01:45:26 Congratulations. Congratulations, you did it Gump. Wow, he really leveled up there, he did it.
01:45:33 That was good. God, I like this, I like the voicemails of like, there's like,
01:45:38 now I'm musical, you can follow along with it. Yeah, there was effort put in there,
01:45:43 there was a complete character arc of Racist Forest Gump evolving, you know. What a joy,
01:45:50 what a joy. I would like the audio for all the Racist Forest Gumps to be put into like,
01:45:57 animated as a thing. That would be incredible. It would be the coolest looking thing I'd ever seen.
01:46:03 I'm sure they're all available on the SoundCloud, you know, under Racist Forest Gump,
01:46:08 because I put the names in all of them, so they're all there. It's probably like four or five or
01:46:13 something, including if you want to include the intro to last episode where someone did the voice
01:46:18 of Racist Forest Gump. Anyway, that was dope. Thanks Gump, appreciate that, love you, see you
01:46:25 soon in that dusty trail. But that's it for the episode I guess, that's our last voicemail,
01:46:30 that's our last problem. Do we still do questions? We don't, we stopped doing questions,
01:46:38 we've evolved. When the fuck did this happen? A month ago? A month or two ago? That's impossible,
01:46:45 I was on like four episodes ago and we were still doing them. Yeah, pretty sure we stopped at that
01:46:50 point. I think the last time was, the podcast went on for a really long time and then we did
01:46:57 voicemails and it felt like there couldn't possibly be anything else to do anyway. But we already
01:47:03 had stopped doing questions by that point and that's the end of the show. I just didn't even
01:47:07 fucking notice. Well the voicemails are fucking way better than the questions, so I'm happy.
01:47:12 Agreed, we all agree, I think. I don't think anybody misses them too much. Anyway, patreon.com
