00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.
00:00:30 This is Gibbontake and we've got Simsie. Today is with us. Simsie at Simsie Fart on Twitter is a self-described artist who likes drawing lips and boobs and flanged.
00:00:50 I bought into the meme. I bought into the cryptocurrency.
00:00:54 It's a great meme and I'm honestly a little sad that nobody else made a flange sonar for themselves. Only is.
00:01:03 Well, I think it's because your octopus hermit is the only one.
00:01:08 The fucking profile picture on Twitter is hideous.
00:01:11 It's so terrifying.
00:01:13 That's what's cool about it, you fucking idiot.
00:01:17 It's so abrasively vile that it's put everybody off of contributing to this fucking meme.
00:01:24 Is that what being flanged means? I don't know, man.
00:01:28 Yeah, you saw the monkey. You know what it means to be flanged and yet it's simply the most desirable state.
00:01:38 I don't understand.
00:01:39 Well, you have to be a man. You have to be a male to be flanged.
00:01:42 If you're a fucking unflanged...
00:01:44 You males can't have flanges.
00:01:46 That's what you think.
00:01:48 If you're an unflanged human, then yeah, of course you fucking see a flange. You're like, ew.
00:01:53 But that's just the sign of the unflanged is that you don't fucking appreciate it.
00:01:58 The sign of the unflanged.
00:02:00 Oh my god.
00:02:01 It's the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast is being unflanged.
00:02:05 It's the mark of either an imbecile or the unflanged.
00:02:08 The sign of the unflanged is like an Anamorph's book title.
00:02:16 I don't even read those. It just feels like the sort of thing.
00:02:19 I retweeted that meme from the Anamorph in Time Twitter of the cover of an Anamorph's book, but it's Rick turning into Pickle Rick.
00:02:29 No.
00:02:30 Oh, that one fucking did me. That one did me a chuckle.
00:02:34 That one really got me.
00:02:36 I haven't even thought about Rick and Morty in such a long time.
00:02:40 Rick and Morty has just been absent from my cultural perception for like a year now.
00:02:48 It's not about Rick and Morty. It was about, I'm there for the Anamorph's content.
00:02:55 And there I see the cover of an Anamorph's book and I'm like, ah, yes, this is what I'm interested in.
00:03:00 But the twist is what if it were Rick and Morty and then I remember, oh, Rick and Morty.
00:03:05 What a time in the zeitgeist that was.
00:03:09 What a blunder.
00:03:10 What a blunder.
00:03:11 Did you see that Justin Roiland was bullied for making a Rick and Morty NFT?
00:03:17 And then he was like, ah, geez, guys, ah, geez.
00:03:20 Oh, geez.
00:03:21 He was like, legitimately, ah, geez.
00:03:25 I saw that he was making an NFT.
00:03:28 Okay, but did he get bullied out of it?
00:03:31 I don't know whether he got bullied out of it, but he was bullied and he made a sad tweet about it.
00:03:36 He should be bullied.
00:03:37 It's like, I can't, I can't, this is why I can't deal with Twitter, you guys.
00:03:41 And then I don't know what he did after that.
00:03:43 Oh, I saw that.
00:03:44 I saw that fucking weak shit, the fucking weak pussy cow or that piece of shit.
00:03:47 I hope he fucking dies.
00:03:48 Fuck that guy.
00:03:49 Nah, fuck him and his NFP.
00:03:51 He's rich! Who cares what he thinks?
00:03:53 Yeah, exactly.
00:03:55 I think, I think you're agreeing with me.
00:03:57 I'm not sure.
00:03:58 A little bit.
00:04:00 There's some truth in my statements.
00:04:02 Fuck him.
00:04:03 Oh, deny it.
00:04:04 Fuck him.
00:04:05 Oh, I'm just in Rowland.
00:04:06 He's just in fucking Rowland.
00:04:07 What does he need to make an NFT for?
00:04:09 Oh, I scream.
00:04:10 Nothing.
00:04:11 I really think it's like, it's just, he had no idea somehow.
00:04:16 I don't know how.
00:04:17 I don't know how he had no idea.
00:04:19 He feels like he would be more connected to the internet.
00:04:21 Maybe he's been deliberately distancing himself from it.
00:04:24 And thus does not know how bad NFTs are and was surprised.
00:04:28 Well, I can believe him not knowing, but if he's going to do it, he should.
00:04:33 I mean, he should have researched it ahead of time and he should know.
00:04:36 Before you do one, you should know what it is and know why it's bad.
00:04:41 All that I care about is that he didn't do it.
00:04:44 He was pulled out of it.
00:04:45 I've got to make a confession here.
00:04:47 When I first heard of NFTs and I didn't know any of the concerns around it, I was like,
00:04:52 I'm going to make one of those.
00:04:54 And I didn't.
00:04:55 Well, we're all born knowing nothing.
00:04:57 Right.
00:04:58 Yeah, I don't.
00:04:59 I don't like blame people.
00:05:02 Like, I don't, I don't blame him.
00:05:04 I don't blame him as long as he didn't go through with it.
00:05:06 As long as he didn't fucking make that devil's bargain.
00:05:09 I don't blame him for doing a bad thing.
00:05:14 As long as he didn't do the bad thing, then everything's fine.
00:05:17 I don't.
00:05:18 Well, I don't.
00:05:19 I mean, I say I don't care that he was going to do it.
00:05:21 I wouldn't care if he was going to do it as long as he changed his mind and did the right thing.
00:05:25 That's, that's all I'm saying.
00:05:28 But, but, but you know what?
00:05:32 But on the other hand, what, what drives, you're, you're just in Royland.
00:05:38 You have like TV shows on like networks.
00:05:42 You are like, you are like a rich, famous person who's like well connected in the industry.
00:05:46 You've, you've, you've literally got it all.
00:05:48 What drives you at that point to be like, I should make an NFT?
00:05:53 I think.
00:05:54 What, what's the, what's the point?
00:05:56 Most likely it's a PR person saying, hey, NFTs are a thing that's going around now.
00:06:00 You should make one.
00:06:01 We've got the thing set up and he's like, oh, okay, cool.
00:06:05 Ah, geez.
00:06:06 And then he tweets about it, not like, I feel like he wouldn't have, if he had found about it,
00:06:13 found out about it himself, he probably wouldn't have like promoted it.
00:06:19 I feel like it's just one of those things.
00:06:22 Because a lot of people who don't know what they're talking about have things called jobs
00:06:28 in the real world, in offices, and they wear suits and then they don't know anything.
00:06:32 And then they tell people to do stuff.
00:06:34 I feel like one of those people told him to make an NFT.
00:06:38 It's definitely more of a publicity thing than like a money thing.
00:06:42 Like he doesn't need the money.
00:06:43 It's just this concept is popular at the moment.
00:06:47 It's an extra boost.
00:06:48 Does it generate publicity that you made an NFT?
00:06:53 Generally have no idea.
00:06:54 Does it do that?
00:06:55 I don't understand the mindset of people.
00:06:56 I think it's just like, oh, it's the hot new fad thing.
00:06:58 Exactly, yeah.
00:06:59 Do you see the guy, the Oscars, the guy's golden head?
00:07:04 Yeah.
00:07:05 Oh, God.
00:07:07 Oh, the guy who played Bozeman.
00:07:09 Chadwick Boseman.
00:07:10 Chadwick Boseman.
00:07:11 Chad Boseman.
00:07:12 Real Chad.
00:07:13 See, that one's actively disgusting.
00:07:17 That's one of the most loyal things that has come out of this whole NFT thing.
00:07:21 That one was pretty hideous.
00:07:23 It is.
00:07:25 Say what you like about NFTs, but that one's not in good taste.
00:07:32 I saw that it was just like, it was like a stock, like 3D model that like the NFT,
00:07:38 the guy who made the NFT, just like he bought the model and then he just like applied a gold texture to it.
00:07:43 He didn't even make the model.
00:07:46 I don't know.
00:07:49 I'm an multimedia artist.
00:07:51 I take the tools and use them to my fullest extent and make thousands upon thousands of dollars of selling an NFT of it.
00:07:58 I love my book.
00:08:00 And fuck you.
00:08:01 If some PR suit told him, like, NFTs are hot, it'll be a big thing if you do one right now.
00:08:08 People will think it's cool and he was like, okay, I guess.
00:08:11 And he did it, like, I mean, fair enough, I guess.
00:08:14 But I mean, if not, like the alternative is that like...
00:08:18 There's no reason to defend it.
00:08:20 Oh, him.
00:08:21 The alternative is that he thought it was cool.
00:08:23 The bullying him into not doing it is a good thing.
00:08:28 Yeah, it's a force for good.
00:08:30 I just wonder, I just wonder, like, did he think it was cool?
00:08:34 That's what it means.
00:08:35 Like, what does it say?
00:08:36 What should I infer about you that you were gonna, that you were like on board with this?
00:08:43 I don't know.
00:08:44 Because it's so lame.
00:08:45 It's so shit and lame and bad.
00:08:47 It's bad in so many ways.
00:08:48 Even if it didn't destroy the environment, I would still hate it, honestly.
00:08:54 Is NFT more like not fucking tasty?
00:08:59 Because we can't eat it.
00:09:01 Yeah, true.
00:09:02 Not flanged.
00:09:03 It's flat.
00:09:04 Not at all.
00:09:05 Not at all.
00:09:06 It's the opposite of being flanged, guys.
00:09:08 New vile, fresh teat.
00:09:10 Gross.
00:09:11 No, wow.
00:09:12 I don't think new vile is the right word to use there.
00:09:15 Gross.
00:09:16 But that's what it stands for now.
00:09:18 What does new vile mean?
00:09:19 Hey, guys, welcome to the new vile means that you're capable of, new vile means that you
00:09:24 are capable of childbirth, right?
00:09:26 That's what new vile means.
00:09:28 Oh, no.
00:09:29 Well, you know.
00:09:31 I mean, stranger things have happened.
00:09:33 I guess so.
00:09:36 Speaking of teats, Simsie.
00:09:38 Jesus.
00:09:39 That's me.
00:09:40 Hello.
00:09:41 You draw the ladies a lot.
00:09:44 Teats.
00:09:45 You draw the ladies.
00:09:46 Yes.
00:09:47 Teats on the ladies, on the teats.
00:09:49 And there they are.
00:09:50 Links in the description.
00:09:52 You are very good at what you do.
00:09:54 Thank you.
00:09:55 I make baseless thoughtless art with the sole purpose of titillation.
00:10:01 You do the cash grab fan art, pick a popular character, cash in on their existing fan base,
00:10:11 draw them looking sexy, rinse, repeat.
00:10:14 You've done me there.
00:10:15 You're right.
00:10:16 It's true.
00:10:17 I mean, I see you do it.
00:10:19 And I know what you're doing.
00:10:21 And it's fine.
00:10:22 I get it.
00:10:23 But yeah, you're a guy.
00:10:26 You like to draw.
00:10:27 It says right in your body.
00:10:28 You like to draw tits and lips.
00:10:30 Why not draw them on, you know, Nico Robin or, I don't know, Tubi or like whoever is fucking trending right now.
00:10:37 Or Goku or whatever.
00:10:40 Or whatever.
00:10:41 Yeah.
00:10:42 It's so easy.
00:10:43 It's like cheating.
00:10:44 It's not fair.
00:10:45 It really is.
00:10:46 And that's why you've got like 10 times as many Twitter followers.
00:10:51 What do you mean like 40k?
00:10:53 I used to hate that.
00:10:54 Like people who would just do whatever is popular and make bank off of it and usually tits are involved.
00:11:00 I'm like, damn it.
00:11:01 I don't want to do that.
00:11:03 But if I did want to do that, I'd be jealous.
00:11:07 Realizing that I don't actually care to do that art.
00:11:10 It means that it's fine.
00:11:11 People are just making money.
00:11:12 I'm under the impression that you're just kind of just genuinely like doing it.
00:11:19 Yes.
00:11:20 And you're not like suffering through the process.
00:11:23 I'm just doing this cynically to fool them all.
00:11:27 No, no, no.
00:11:28 I would still be drawing tits if like commissions were not a concept in this universe.
00:11:33 I would still just be like drawing tits in person online.
00:11:36 Like it's not purely for the money.
00:11:38 The followers of the fame.
00:11:39 I just really like doing it.
00:11:42 I never disliked it because it was like a cynical thing.
00:11:46 I was just sort of like, oh, damn it.
00:11:50 People make money from things they draw that I am not drawing.
00:11:55 That sucks.
00:11:57 I wish that sucks when people do that.
00:12:00 When people go to Google.com, they type in their favorite character, Big Booby, and they would find my art instead.
00:12:07 But they don't do that.
00:12:09 That is one of the most satisfying things about.
00:12:11 I think I am a little bit of an egomaniac, to be honest.
00:12:14 Like seeing my numbers go up is very satisfying.
00:12:17 Like typing in a character like Google.
00:12:20 Yeah, typing in a character on Google and seeing my own art on there.
00:12:24 Just like on Google.
00:12:26 That's really weird.
00:12:28 The couple times that I...
00:12:30 Yeah, I had them...
00:12:32 I've done a couple pieces of fan art.
00:12:34 I've never done number one result or anything.
00:12:36 But I have a couple of old fan arts that I did.
00:12:39 Like if you Google Lisa and you scroll down a little ways on the...
00:12:44 It doesn't take you that far to find the one like Lisa fan art that I did.
00:12:48 Yeah.
00:12:49 I think that's pretty cool.
00:12:50 Where she became president in 2020?
00:12:52 Yes, where Lisa Simpson became president in 2020.
00:12:56 No, the one with the game, with the guy.
00:13:00 With Brad.
00:13:02 Darling House?
00:13:04 No!
00:13:06 No.
00:13:07 Greg of Art, he'll come back.
00:13:10 Yes, yes.
00:13:13 Speaking of the Simpsons, have you guys heard Dr. Hibbert's new voice?
00:13:18 There's a voice?
00:13:20 Yeah, Dr. Hibbert.
00:13:22 No, I heard that he has one.
00:13:24 I haven't heard it.
00:13:26 They recast Carl and Dr. Hibbert and all the other recurring black characters because, you know...
00:13:32 White people can't play with people.
00:13:35 Okay.
00:13:36 I'm fine with that, but the voice for... they're not good voices.
00:13:41 I...
00:13:42 That is the...
00:13:43 I don't know.
00:13:44 The concern sometimes.
00:13:45 I don't know.
00:13:46 I mean, who cares, really?
00:13:47 It is the Simpsons.
00:13:49 If it ruins the jokes, then that's the problem, I guess.
00:13:53 I mean, if it's just unfamiliar, then people can get used to it.
00:13:57 Yeah, I guess who cares, really.
00:14:00 It's pretty weird.
00:14:01 It's like a quasi-impression of the old one, but like much deeper and like...
00:14:04 Of course.
00:14:05 Squishy-squishier sounding.
00:14:07 He's got that like, whoa, thing going on with his voice, you know what I mean?
00:14:10 That's like a weird way of putting it, but...
00:14:13 He's... what?
00:14:14 He's got the what?
00:14:15 Like, like...
00:14:17 He sounds a bit like Mr. Bean, but like an American man.
00:14:20 I was gonna say, Mr. Bean.
00:14:21 Jesus Christ.
00:14:25 Yeah, exactly.
00:14:27 Like, he's got big jowls on his face.
00:14:30 Yeah.
00:14:31 I get... I think that the Appu thing makes more sense,
00:14:35 because Appu is like a specific ethnic group,
00:14:39 and he's from a country, and he has a linguistic accent.
00:14:43 Dr. Hippard and Carl are just like American dudes.
00:14:47 Yeah.
00:14:48 I don't know.
00:14:49 I don't know about that one.
00:14:50 The thing with him is the aspect of the character matching...
00:14:57 Like, the voice actor matching the ethnicity of the character being portrayed.
00:15:02 That doesn't matter, because voice actors are talented.
00:15:05 The actual issue that was like...
00:15:09 Nobody really understood, because the surface level of,
00:15:12 oh, it's a brown character played by a white person.
00:15:15 That's bad.
00:15:16 Like, that's fine.
00:15:17 It's just that there's less minorities in the industry,
00:15:20 or able to get into the industry as work tech.
00:15:24 I mean, is that...
00:15:26 All characters could be black voice actors,
00:15:30 if there's no reason some of them have to be white,
00:15:33 because they're played by white characters all the other way around.
00:15:36 It's just like, there should be, you know...
00:15:38 It's not really... that's the reason, Ben.
00:15:41 It's not really that's the reason.
00:15:43 The show is 30 years old, and made it a time when you just hire people.
00:15:48 Yeah.
00:15:50 I think it's probably good.
00:15:53 It's good if people of every stripe can get a fucking job doing their shit.
00:16:00 That's all fine and good.
00:16:04 We should have...
00:16:06 We should have the white characters.
00:16:09 They should have replaced white characters with black voice actors.
00:16:13 I just wanted to say, the voices do sound really bad.
00:16:17 It's just my point.
00:16:19 Well, I don't know.
00:16:21 What are you going to say?
00:16:23 If people are trying to do an impression of a character that has existed for 30 years,
00:16:27 it's definitely going to feel weird.
00:16:29 Yeah.
00:16:30 Because it's not the same.
00:16:31 No, yeah.
00:16:32 I just watched the real gyms did a...
00:16:37 You know him? The Simpsons? The Simps... The Simptuber?
00:16:40 Yeah, he did a character history video on Dr. Hebrou.
00:16:46 Maybe that was why he picked him or something.
00:16:50 Oh, maybe.
00:16:51 There's not that much to talk about, really.
00:16:55 Dr. Hebrou is not like Edna Krabapal or someone who has a arc that's carried throughout the show.
00:17:06 Dr. Hebrou has been the same fucking guy every single time he's appeared.
00:17:11 He's never had an episode dedicated to him, ever.
00:17:19 Wasn't there that one time there was a mayoral race and Mr. Burns was running,
00:17:26 and he had his League of Evil politician people?
00:17:32 Or maybe it was just some other evil organization.
00:17:34 And there was Mr. Burns there, for one.
00:17:36 But Hebert was there.
00:17:39 Are you talking about when Cytro Bob was running for the Republican Party?
00:17:43 That's what it was. Cytro Bob.
00:17:45 And Hebert was there.
00:17:46 Yeah, that was weird.
00:17:47 I don't know why he...
00:17:48 That was a very secret Republican.
00:17:52 Is that some weird statement on hospitals being secretly owned by political parties or something like that?
00:17:59 Like bias towards them? I don't know.
00:18:02 I think they probably just picked a bunch of kind of upper crusty springfieldians
00:18:13 and were like, we'll make them the secret Republican cabal.
00:18:16 And you know, you pick a doctor, you pick a lawyer, you pick the rich Texan guy.
00:18:24 You would think Dr. Nick more so, wouldn't you?
00:18:28 Dr. Nick.
00:18:30 No, I think...
00:18:32 No, I can totally see Dr. Herbert being a Republican.
00:18:35 He wears fucking Argyle sweaters.
00:18:39 He's got his wife...
00:18:41 No, his wife wears the fucking shoulder pad suits.
00:18:45 He's well to do.
00:18:50 That's kind of his joke, isn't it?
00:18:52 His joke is that he always says something totally horrible.
00:18:57 But laughs afterwards.
00:18:59 And so it's like silly how he's laughing about it.
00:19:03 Maybe he's a really nice diva.
00:19:09 Can't do his voice at all.
00:19:13 Yeah, that's much better.
00:19:15 I'm so bad at voices. I used to be okay, but now I just don't even try.
00:19:20 Oh, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? It's complicated.
00:19:26 I'm gonna get fired.
00:19:32 Israel deserves to exist, Bart.
00:19:38 Do we want to get into that?
00:19:40 Worse fucking hybrid impression.
00:19:44 We could. I'm flabbergasted.
00:19:48 That was a really awful hybrid impression.
00:19:51 Let me try again. He sounds like...
00:19:57 There's a couple of injections into the spine.
00:20:01 Oh, God, I don't remember. I don't remember what he sounds like.
00:20:06 He goes, no, let's get along with your COVID-19 vaccination.
00:20:11 That's better than mine.
00:20:15 Right, there's war. There's war happening now.
00:20:21 It was kind of like Israel-Lamao.
00:20:27 Israel-Lamao. A week ago, when it was Monday, I think, everything kicked off.
00:20:33 When there was the attack on that mosque and those people praying.
00:20:37 It was the Islamic religious holiday.
00:20:40 And then Hamas retaliated by firing rockets and then Israel jumped in and shot back.
00:20:45 It was like, okay, it's a big old thing.
00:20:47 Is that what inside of the Hamas rockets, the mosque attack?
00:20:53 I missed that part. I forgot.
00:20:56 I think that was the initial spark.
00:21:00 The first thing I saw was there were people praying in Arab.
00:21:07 Is it Muslim?
00:21:09 Yes, it's the word.
00:21:11 During a religious holiday, one of the three most important places for Islam.
00:21:26 It was tear-gassed by Israeli police at the time for seemingly no reason.
00:21:34 I didn't know what was going on.
00:21:36 I still don't really know.
00:21:38 But tensions between Jews and Arabs in the area have been high and up and down for generations.
00:21:47 Ramadan ended May 12.
00:21:56 The basic gist is, from what I understand, the Israeli Prime Minister.
00:22:05 I forget his name.
00:22:07 Netanyahu.
00:22:09 He's a far-right ethno-nationalist who is very anti-Arab.
00:22:16 Right now, him attacking in such force is good for his party.
00:22:27 Because Hamas is firing rockets, he can get to say,
00:22:33 you need to keep me in power because I'm defending you, citizens.
00:22:38 These terrorists are destroying us.
00:22:41 And if we don't blow them to fucking Kingdom come, they'll come and get you.
00:22:46 Vote for me in the next election, lol.
00:22:50 Nice, nice.
00:22:53 It sounds about right.
00:22:55 It's pretty bad.
00:22:57 I didn't know much about the Israel-Palestine conflict other than what I'd heard from bits and bobs
00:23:02 in my entire life that it's complicated.
00:23:07 I guess it's too complicated.
00:23:09 I don't want to know.
00:23:11 That's what bugs me.
00:23:13 I was raised as a kid.
00:23:16 I was told that that whole Israel-Palestine thing,
00:23:21 it's an ancient battle that's been fought.
00:23:24 It's like the blood war.
00:23:26 It's like the blood war between demons and devils.
00:23:28 It's raged since time immemorial.
00:23:30 It's an intractable conflict that can never be solved.
00:23:34 It will outlast all of us and it began before anyone living today.
00:23:39 Israel is like 50 years old.
00:23:42 It was made within living memory.
00:23:46 It's like a new country.
00:23:47 It was made at the end of the First World War.
00:23:50 I looked into the origin of all of it.
00:23:54 And it's basically Britain's fault.
00:23:58 Because that land was occupied by Turkey.
00:24:02 During the First World War, Turkey stayed neutral for a while,
00:24:05 but then due to some shenanigans,
00:24:07 because they were upset at the Ottoman Empire shrinking.
00:24:12 The Balkan Wars previously were like,
00:24:14 they lost territory and they're like,
00:24:16 damn it, we got to make the Empire great again.
00:24:19 So they joined Germany.
00:24:21 And so in order to fight off the Turks,
00:24:23 the British enlisted the help of some Arabs
00:24:26 who were trying to, from Arabs in the area,
00:24:31 they wanted a unified Middle East, a singular nation.
00:24:36 And they said, we'll help you fight the Turks, Britain,
00:24:40 if you help us and recognize our right to this land.
00:24:44 And the Britons said, okay.
00:24:46 And then they fought together in the war.
00:24:49 And then Britain was like, and lol, no, actually,
00:24:52 we're just going to carve out the land to our own benefit.
00:24:54 Against the Turks of the Ottoman Empire, right?
00:24:56 Am I following you?
00:24:57 The Turks were defeated.
00:24:59 The Ottoman Empire was pushed back.
00:25:01 And that land that was going to be like a united Arab era,
00:25:05 I can't think of the word to describe.
00:25:09 It was agreements.
00:25:11 There was stuff on Wikipedia about it that I read.
00:25:14 It's basically all I did.
00:25:15 I just looked at Wikipedia for like three hours.
00:25:18 But then Britain and France secretly had been talking,
00:25:23 all right, so we're not actually going to recognize their state.
00:25:27 We're just going to take...
00:25:29 Radcon 5 Gibbon takes lecture on the Israeli Palestine.
00:25:33 Yeah, this is brilliant.
00:25:40 It's just Wikipedia.
00:25:41 It's so easy to find.
00:25:42 I could fucking do a lecture on it.
00:25:44 It'd be funny.
00:25:45 Do it.
00:25:48 So like Britain and France, it was just like,
00:25:52 let's cut up the land.
00:25:53 We're going to make Jordan here.
00:25:54 We're going to make Lebanon.
00:25:55 We're going to make Palestine cut the land into these sections.
00:25:59 And those are the countries in that area now.
00:26:02 For their own benefit to like for trade or something,
00:26:06 colonies, I don't remember exactly what the reason for cutting it up.
00:26:10 Obviously it was beneficial for them.
00:26:12 They just said, we're not going to honor the promise to you Arabs.
00:26:18 And I think that carried over into a different separate agreement
00:26:23 that was made by Zionists and the British government at the time
00:26:30 to make a safe haven for Jews in Palestine after the First World War
00:26:36 because the Jews were going to help fight in the war if they agreed to that
00:26:40 and they made an agreement.
00:26:41 I thought...
00:26:42 And the agreement was extremely vague
00:26:46 and did not consider the Palestinian people who lived there or the Arabs
00:26:52 and at last it was just sort of between Jews and the British government.
00:26:59 We want a place to live and we want it to be in our homeland
00:27:02 and this Holy Land area give us this.
00:27:05 And they said, okay, we won the war.
00:27:08 Turkey is smaller and this area is now occupied by the Britain.
00:27:13 We're going to give you this land in Palestine
00:27:16 and we're just going to leave the rules very vague
00:27:18 and you can have a land in Palestine, quote, in Palestine.
00:27:22 It doesn't say how much of Palestine.
00:27:25 And then they just left and everything was fucked from there
00:27:29 because the Palestinians were like, you didn't tell us...
00:27:33 You first of all fucking betrayed us.
00:27:37 You said this whole area was going to be like an Arab.
00:27:42 You lied, you bastard.
00:27:44 And also you're giving this land to the Jews
00:27:49 and I don't know whether they were on good terms back then.
00:27:53 I don't know religious history that much.
00:27:58 But they obviously were persecuted up to that point, the Jewish people.
00:28:04 So I guess it was not welcome and they started fighting almost immediately
00:28:09 and it wasn't so bad for a while.
00:28:12 I don't know, that was where my reading stopped.
00:28:15 But basically Britain fucked everything up.
00:28:18 You sound like you've read up more on it than I have,
00:28:22 but I thought that the Israel that exists today,
00:28:27 I thought that it came into being after World War II and the Holocaust.
00:28:34 What happened with that is that the Holocaust had...
00:28:37 Obviously Germany at that time was doing a lot of bad stuff to Jews.
00:28:41 They had to run away.
00:28:43 Lots of them ran to Israel and they grew Israel
00:28:47 because there's more Jews there and people would come in all the time
00:28:52 and it would grow and they would use the excuse that
00:29:00 there's more people here, we need more land.
00:29:03 Hey Palestinians, we're going to take more of your land now
00:29:06 and you're just going to give it to us
00:29:08 and there's nothing you can do about it because we have the backing of the West
00:29:11 because current day the US backs Israel a lot
00:29:19 specifically because it is a good jumping off point
00:29:23 as a good jumping off point to bully other places in the Middle East with military power.
00:29:29 This is a very powerful place.
00:29:31 Have you seen that old clip of like somewhat younger,
00:29:38 weirdly balder Joe Biden ranting about Israel?
00:29:47 There's a several minute clip of him.
00:29:49 He's like banging his fist and he's shouting
00:29:52 and he comes off as extremely aggressive and thuggish almost
00:29:56 and he's like, if we didn't have an Israel,
00:29:59 America would have to invent an Israel to protect our interest in the region
00:30:03 and stuff like that.
00:30:04 It's like, oh boy, now here's a guy who really likes Israel.
00:30:10 Our interest in the region meaning quick and easy access to bullying Arabs out of their oil.
00:30:17 I don't think it's entirely about oil.
00:30:20 It's about foreign policy relationships.
00:30:24 It's about foreign policy, but ultimately foreign policy is dictated by resources
00:30:29 that the US and the UK to some extent.
00:30:32 I don't know exactly what they're...
00:30:34 They have not like...
00:30:37 What was that thing?
00:30:39 There's like a call for a ceasefire, the UN,
00:30:42 but the US didn't back it.
00:30:43 Everyone else did, including the UK.
00:30:45 So I don't know exactly what the UK's relationship is.
00:30:48 But yeah, it's a foreign policy thing,
00:30:52 but a lot of it is dictated by resources, oil, other things, uranium that you can mine.
00:30:59 Are you still learning Arabic, by the way?
00:31:02 Capitalism is the problem.
00:31:03 Capitalism is the problem.
00:31:05 True.
00:31:06 If I can...
00:31:08 I did stop.
00:31:10 I just fell off.
00:31:14 I like it.
00:31:15 It's a cool language.
00:31:16 I want to learn how to write it, like calligraphy style.
00:31:19 It looks so cool.
00:31:21 It's a really cool looking language, written...
00:31:26 I do remember a lot of the little quirks of writing the letters,
00:31:32 where there's a shape that is like one way when it's the first letter in a word,
00:31:39 and then another way when it's like the middle letter in a word,
00:31:42 and you can recognize the similar swerve of the ink,
00:31:47 and it's like, ah, that's a zh sound.
00:31:50 That's a zh, and if you put a dot about it, it's a zh sound.
00:31:53 Stuff like that.
00:31:55 How are you feeling by the way?
00:31:57 It's cool.
00:31:59 Feeling?
00:32:00 Have you recovered?
00:32:02 Oh no, I feel terrible right now.
00:32:05 Nice.
00:32:07 I was going to talk about it, but I need to pee,
00:32:10 so I'll be back in a second.
00:32:12 Ah yes.
00:32:14 Okay, Simsie.
00:32:16 Let's talk about what a fucking nerd give is,
00:32:20 for doing research and reading up on history and shit.
00:32:24 She knows things I don't.
00:32:26 I have nothing to contribute.
00:32:28 Yeah, I didn't go that in depth with it.
00:32:32 I'm just a basic bitch.
00:32:39 I'm just your basic bitch.
00:32:42 I see some fucking ethnic cleansing on my Twitter timeline.
00:32:46 I say, I don't like that.
00:32:48 Exactly.
00:32:49 I saw a headline and I was like, oh that's bad,
00:32:51 and then I haven't seen anything else again.
00:32:55 Wait, I did make that.
00:32:57 I made a, since I was fucking around in Game Maker,
00:33:02 I made a quick and dirty edit to my game
00:33:06 to record a little footage of Phantom Horn destroying Israel.
00:33:12 Oh my god.
00:33:15 That was a bit...
00:33:17 That was great.
00:33:19 I mean, I understand the sentiment is funny.
00:33:21 It's like, yes, Israel is being bad,
00:33:24 but the idea of destroying it with a sword slice...
00:33:27 I was laughing so hard as I uploaded.
00:33:31 Just imagine you sat in your dark room,
00:33:34 hunched over on your keyboard.
00:33:36 It's pretty edgy.
00:33:38 It isn't that edgy.
00:33:40 You click done after importing Israel.png to Game Maker.
00:33:45 I would do the same thing for America.
00:33:48 You think I won't have Phantom Horn slice Israel,
00:33:51 I mean America in half?
00:33:52 I'll do it.
00:33:53 I get it, but I think it's annoying,
00:33:58 but it's true that there's a lot of actual anti-Semites
00:34:03 who just hate Israel for stupid reasons,
00:34:07 and they would want to kill Israel and Israelites and Jews.
00:34:12 And so people get confused a lot.
00:34:15 It's annoying.
00:34:17 There's this very clear difference
00:34:20 of the actions of a prime minister who is a far-right guy
00:34:24 and an entire ethnic group.
00:34:28 I did get one or two people mad at me and their replies,
00:34:31 but it's a country, and countries aren't people,
00:34:34 and countries are bad, states are bad,
00:34:36 and they should be killed.
00:34:38 So, I don't know.
00:34:40 Fuck it.
00:34:42 Insert any fucking country you want in there,
00:34:47 and it's fine.
00:34:48 It's always correct.
00:34:49 It's always moral to kill a country.
00:34:52 Yeah, fucking it.
00:34:54 It's not in Merry Old England.
00:34:56 I do like the design of the flag,
00:34:58 but I will destroy it.
00:35:00 I will kill everyone present.
00:35:02 It's aesthetically pleasing.
00:35:04 Give me, put the England in there,
00:35:07 and I will just, I'll have phantom horn
00:35:09 just neatly slice Northern Ireland right off.
00:35:12 Right off of it.
00:35:14 Freedom.
00:35:15 Freedom.
00:35:16 Northern Ireland is an England ban.
00:35:18 That's not part of England, you fool.
00:35:20 Wait, is that, am I stupid?
00:35:23 I thought Northern Ireland was part of England.
00:35:27 It's part of the United Kingdom.
00:35:29 England is its England.
00:35:31 Oh God, yeah, now you're right.
00:35:33 England and Scotland and Northern Ireland and Wales,
00:35:36 to some extent.
00:35:37 I was just thinking like,
00:35:39 you could do like a whole political series
00:35:41 of phantom horn destroys X,
00:35:43 and it would be like, oh Brexit,
00:35:45 like slicing the UK off from Europe.
00:35:48 From the EU, yeah.
00:35:51 It's like, oh man, commission.
00:35:53 Commission me to have,
00:35:55 you can have phantom horn slice anything
00:35:57 you want in that.
00:36:01 Unironically, could be like a,
00:36:03 like a Patreon reward.
00:36:06 I mean, shit.
00:36:08 $70.
00:36:09 I mean shit.
00:36:10 Yeah, I could, I can,
00:36:12 when the game's done, I can release
00:36:15 a custom version.
00:36:17 Patreon me $100, and I will release a custom version
00:36:20 that just has, I will put
00:36:22 anything you want in there as the final boss.
00:36:25 Well, I don't know about anything you want.
00:36:27 Anything you want.
00:36:29 Anything, it's yours.
00:36:31 It's done.
00:36:32 This could backfire heavily.
00:36:35 No.
00:36:36 I'll just pretend someone else did it.
00:36:38 I'll pretend they hacked the game.
00:36:40 Somebody modded my game.
00:36:42 They modded my game against my will.
00:36:44 Should we go back to Gibbs Health
00:36:46 for a second?
00:36:48 Sure.
00:36:49 Oh, yeah.
00:36:50 Yeah, I mean, I sound all right at the moment,
00:36:52 I think.
00:36:55 But last few days,
00:36:57 especially, have been
00:36:59 agonizing.
00:37:01 And I don't like it.
00:37:03 It's, I'm still waiting
00:37:06 one, I've got one week to go
00:37:08 waiting for my fucking
00:37:11 ultrasound that I'm having on my
00:37:14 liver so they can see inside
00:37:16 and see, ooh, there's a gremlin in there.
00:37:18 We mis-stab it and chop it up.
00:37:20 There's a nasty Whittle Galboy.
00:37:22 Just get the harpoon.
00:37:24 Nasty Whittle Galboy in there.
00:37:28 Yeah, I still don't have a diagnosis.
00:37:30 I've been waiting.
00:37:31 They said they'll call me or text me or whatever.
00:37:35 I gave my blood.
00:37:36 What more can I do?
00:37:37 The ultrasound is the only thing left
00:37:39 that is like a test to be done.
00:37:41 So I assume after I get that done,
00:37:43 they'll tell me that I'm going to die
00:37:45 in one minute.
00:37:48 Did you get vaccinated yet?
00:37:50 No.
00:37:51 Vaccines are still like,
00:37:53 you have to be old-ish.
00:37:55 Really?
00:37:56 And they're only now.
00:37:57 Yeah.
00:37:58 You have to be old or sick.
00:37:59 I don't think I'm going to get a vaccine for a while.
00:38:00 Oh, damn.
00:38:01 I guess we're hogging them all.
00:38:03 I was thinking of like seeing
00:38:05 what the accommodation was because I smoke
00:38:07 and seeing if I could get mine a little bit quicker
00:38:09 than all the other-
00:38:10 I've heard that some people have gotten moved up the list
00:38:12 because they smoke, yeah.
00:38:15 Fucking cool as hell.
00:38:16 Yeah, look into that.
00:38:17 Definitely.
00:38:18 Cigarettes are so fucking cool.
00:38:19 No, they're not.
00:38:20 They're so fucking good for you.
00:38:22 No, dude.
00:38:23 I'm so ruthlessly addicted to them.
00:38:25 I literally just like put on my coat,
00:38:26 went out in the rain earlier,
00:38:27 I was smoking.
00:38:29 And I felt like this is nothing.
00:38:31 I'm not even like socially doing it.
00:38:33 I'm just like putting toxins into my body
00:38:35 for no reason.
00:38:37 I mean, yeah.
00:38:39 That's how it is.
00:38:40 But I kind of like it though.
00:38:42 I kind of like it.
00:38:45 Let me just take that nicotine out of there.
00:38:48 I just-
00:38:49 Get some like parsley.
00:38:52 Roll that up.
00:38:54 It would still be toxic to just burn something
00:38:57 and inhale the smoke from it.
00:38:59 I've tried to quit.
00:39:00 It's still bad.
00:39:01 I mean, I've been in the worst situation
00:39:03 because I tried to quit
00:39:04 and I quit for about six months
00:39:06 and like with a vape.
00:39:08 That's pretty good.
00:39:09 Yeah, with a vape.
00:39:10 And then now I just smoke and I vape at the same time.
00:39:12 I smoked less, but I vape a lot.
00:39:14 So now I'm just doing both.
00:39:16 Why didn't you just not buy any more cigarettes
00:39:20 and just vape instead?
00:39:22 That's what I did for six months.
00:39:24 Oh, okay.
00:39:25 And then I went to the pub with my friends
00:39:27 during summer and they were like,
00:39:29 just one, my friend.
00:39:31 And then it happened.
00:39:33 You must kill them.
00:39:36 I have not smoked or vape
00:39:39 like hardly at all for months now.
00:39:41 Occasionally, a friend will offer me a cigarette
00:39:44 and I will smoke it.
00:39:45 But I've been off smoking for long enough
00:39:49 that it doesn't give me the fucking shakes
00:39:54 and I crave it anymore.
00:39:55 I'm just like, I'll smoke one.
00:39:57 And then I'm like, okay.
00:39:58 Well, I think it's literally just a matter
00:40:02 of not being in the habit
00:40:04 of going to the store to buy cigarettes.
00:40:06 Because when I'm in that habit,
00:40:08 then I'll go and I'll buy them
00:40:09 and then I'll have them.
00:40:10 But now I'm out of the habit of buying them
00:40:12 so I never have them.
00:40:14 So it's not even an option.
00:40:15 The price of them keeps going up
00:40:17 and I thought that would stop me.
00:40:18 But also the amount of money I make
00:40:20 has kept going up.
00:40:21 So I just fucking keep buying them.
00:40:24 Well, okay.
00:40:26 You heard it here.
00:40:27 Stop paying Simzi.
00:40:29 You're killing him.
00:40:30 You're killing me.
00:40:31 You're killing me.
00:40:32 Pay us.
00:40:33 Customers.
00:40:34 Yeah, yeah.
00:40:35 Pay the PCP.
00:40:36 Donate.
00:40:37 I don't even smoke weed.
00:40:39 No, I don't.
00:40:40 I hate weed.
00:40:42 I've only smoked weed twice
00:40:43 and I had a horrible experience both times.
00:40:46 I smoked a few times
00:40:49 and it's been like okay at best
00:40:51 and pretty fucking terrible at worst.
00:40:53 I was like, I'm violently sick
00:40:55 and then also all of my senses
00:40:57 went backwards and then I passed out.
00:40:59 That sounds like some strange weed.
00:41:02 I've looked it up
00:41:03 and I think I'm just allergic to it
00:41:05 and had like a really violent reaction
00:41:07 or something.
00:41:08 I had one time that I smoked it
00:41:11 that I thought maybe there was some other stuff
00:41:13 in what I smoked
00:41:15 because this one time that I had it
00:41:17 I had like a really intense
00:41:19 like physical body high
00:41:22 that felt like a nightmare
00:41:25 and I wanted to scream.
00:41:27 That's probably just more accurate.
00:41:28 Like that's not normal.
00:41:30 Yeah.
00:41:31 And it hasn't always been like that.
00:41:33 But it's one time it was super bad.
00:41:35 Both times that it's happened
00:41:37 like everyone else who's done it
00:41:38 has been absolutely fine.
00:41:39 So either it's just
00:41:40 I have a really low tolerance for it
00:41:41 and it's fucked me up
00:41:42 and I think that I'm having
00:41:44 a nightmare reaction
00:41:45 and then it happens.
00:41:47 My understanding
00:41:49 it seems like some people
00:41:51 just feel different
00:41:53 when they smoke it
00:41:54 than other people do
00:41:55 and those people
00:41:56 and I think I'm one of them
00:41:57 and maybe you are too.
00:41:58 It just
00:41:59 for us it just feels like shit
00:42:00 and it's like no thanks.
00:42:02 It was a wild bite.
00:42:03 I mean I've
00:42:04 I've had it like
00:42:06 two or three times
00:42:08 and it's only been
00:42:09 when Trixie has given me some
00:42:11 I've probably done it maybe
00:42:13 or maybe a dozen times
00:42:15 maybe a dozen times at most.
00:42:17 We're so lame.
00:42:19 The most it's ever done
00:42:21 is
00:42:23 at Redcon 4 actually.
00:42:25 I had like a pretty mellow cool
00:42:27 walk on the beach at night.
00:42:28 I was like seeing weird
00:42:29 patents in the sand.
00:42:30 So I was like whoa,
00:42:31 that's nice.
00:42:33 And that was it.
00:42:34 That was the most I ever got high.
00:42:35 I've been much more drunk
00:42:36 than I have been high.
00:42:37 Oh, absolutely.
00:42:38 Yeah.
00:42:39 Before I ever smoked weed
00:42:41 the first high I ever got
00:42:43 was fucking
00:42:45 this is so embarrassing
00:42:46 but it was a
00:42:47 Downing Robotessin
00:42:49 because
00:42:50 my girlfriend in college
00:42:53 she in high school
00:42:54 she and her friends I guess
00:42:56 had just fucking down
00:42:57 Robotessin and Robotrip sometimes
00:42:59 and she got me to try it with her
00:43:01 and it was a
00:43:03 I mean it wasn't
00:43:04 it wasn't too horrible.
00:43:06 It was fine
00:43:07 but it's just so embarrassing
00:43:09 to admit it.
00:43:11 Robotripping is not
00:43:13 it's not cool.
00:43:15 Wait.
00:43:16 It's not hip.
00:43:17 What is that?
00:43:18 It's when you just drink Robotessin.
00:43:20 What's Robotessin?
00:43:21 Is it a brand name
00:43:23 or is it?
00:43:24 It's cough syrup.
00:43:25 Oh.
00:43:27 It's DMX I think
00:43:29 is the chemical in it.
00:43:30 It's a
00:43:31 BMX.
00:43:32 Robotessin.
00:43:33 What's the
00:43:35 what's the active chemical
00:43:37 in Robotessin?
00:43:38 It is
00:43:39 cyanide.
00:43:41 Weed.
00:43:43 Dextro.
00:43:44 Dextro metherfan
00:43:46 is the active chemical
00:43:48 that I don't know
00:43:50 makes you fucking
00:43:51 high and I
00:43:52 did that a bunch of times.
00:43:53 So you got absolutely
00:43:54 shot faced on cough syrup
00:43:56 and had a
00:43:57 had a lovely time.
00:43:59 I don't know if I was shit faced.
00:44:01 I mean it's
00:44:02 I mean I don't know.
00:44:04 I was probably I probably acted weird
00:44:06 because you know
00:44:08 I have really visceral memories
00:44:10 of the first time I smoked weed and
00:44:12 just like after after I'd been sick about
00:44:14 six times I went and sat in the garden on a chair
00:44:16 while everyone else was like getting drunk and stuff
00:44:18 and my friend who's got a really thick
00:44:20 Bristolian accent came over
00:44:22 and kneeled next to me and he's like
00:44:24 it's alright bro.
00:44:25 You're just having a bad trip.
00:44:26 It's alright.
00:44:27 Just calm down.
00:44:28 Just don't worry about it.
00:44:29 It happens to everybody.
00:44:30 It happens to the best of us.
00:44:31 And I was just sitting there just like
00:44:33 please leave me alone.
00:44:34 I can't hear a speech now without feeling
00:44:36 worse.
00:44:37 Yeah.
00:44:38 God bless him.
00:44:39 He's trying his best.
00:44:40 The time that I had the worst
00:44:42 reaction to it I remember
00:44:44 I felt um
00:44:46 I was in a room.
00:44:48 I went to a party after I smoked.
00:44:50 This was with that same
00:44:51 girlfriend in college.
00:44:52 We went to a party
00:44:54 and I was like sitting on the floor
00:44:56 and there was a ceiling fan
00:44:58 going.
00:44:59 It was blowing the air in the room
00:45:00 and
00:45:02 I could feel the wind from the ceiling fan
00:45:04 but in my in my high
00:45:06 my weed state I felt
00:45:08 like it was like a
00:45:10 torrent.
00:45:11 It was like a
00:45:12 I was being like blasted
00:45:14 with like dry air from this
00:45:16 ceiling fan that was like drying me out
00:45:18 and killing me.
00:45:19 In my weed form.
00:45:21 Yeah.
00:45:22 And I was like this is the worst feeling
00:45:24 I've ever felt.
00:45:25 It was awful.
00:45:27 Awful awful.
00:45:28 The second time I had it it felt like
00:45:30 the inside of my nose was swelling up
00:45:32 which which is why I think I'm allergic
00:45:34 because it just sounds like it was happening
00:45:36 and then like it sounds like yeah
00:45:38 the position of taste on my
00:45:40 tongue was swapped.
00:45:41 So like if like a piece of chicken
00:45:43 like because I had chicken wings like afterwards
00:45:45 and I was like I'm gonna eat something because I feel weird
00:45:47 and then like food
00:45:49 on the right side of my mouth felt like
00:45:51 it was on the left side
00:45:52 and I've tried looking this up
00:45:54 and I've never heard of anyone having the experience
00:45:56 like this ever again with weed
00:45:57 and all my friends were completely fine
00:45:59 and I think I'm just
00:46:01 How bizarre.
00:46:02 It was very odd.
00:46:03 It was one of the most unusual.
00:46:04 I've never heard of that before either.
00:46:05 No.
00:46:06 I think you I think you just invented
00:46:08 a new a new symptom.
00:46:10 Maybe I'm just like
00:46:11 of the weed overdose.
00:46:12 Maybe I'm just lying to myself.
00:46:13 Maybe it didn't happen.
00:46:14 I don't know.
00:46:16 It was only last year but
00:46:18 I mean you were twisted.
00:46:20 I was twist.
00:46:21 I was twist.
00:46:22 Hello.
00:46:23 Whatever the new one is.
00:46:24 Twist.
00:46:25 Hello.
00:46:26 Cool.
00:46:27 Dude.
00:46:28 That's so base.
00:46:29 Dude.
00:46:30 Dude.
00:46:31 We should pay a mural.
00:46:32 Back to hook me up.
00:46:34 Hook me.
00:46:35 Introduce me.
00:46:36 You're going to get those connections.
00:46:38 Oh, do you want a back to the.
00:46:41 The Gib.
00:46:42 Okay.
00:46:43 Yeah.
00:46:44 Sure.
00:46:45 Like is dying corner.
00:46:46 aside from aside from all that's happening a new
00:46:50 Complications happened not related. I assume. I have an ear problem now. I think it's nothing serious
00:47:00 Sorry, sorry, I'm just I'm just so bored listening to other people's problems
00:47:05 Then that's so awfully rude you nasty man. I
00:47:09 Know and yet I can't help it. It's my nature to be a nasty man
00:47:17 Capricious
00:47:18 Continue. So is it just some sort like like ear pain or like you can't hear properly? No, no, no it I
00:47:26 Can't hear low frequencies in one of my ears and I couldn't tell what was wrong for a really long time because
00:47:33 most of what I listen to is like
00:47:37 Fine, but as soon as I speak because it's coming from my you know inside my head
00:47:42 I hear all of the frequencies of my voice including the low-end and it's very clearly not right in one of my ears
00:47:49 I can't hear low frequencies in my left ear. It is
00:47:53 so
00:47:55 Frustrating because I feel like I just need to just to grab something in there and pull it out like as a blockage
00:48:02 but obviously
00:48:04 I'm stupid
00:48:05 There was a bit of earwax there and I was like like scratching at it with my finger trying to get it out apparently
00:48:11 That's the worst thing you could do is try to get it out
00:48:15 Because um, you're just pushing it further in and now I think I have a blockage
00:48:20 And that sucks you should you should watch you ever watch those videos on YouTube of like earwax
00:48:26 Blot like clump extraction. No, please. No
00:48:32 No, no, no, I mean
00:48:35 You there you can see fucking giant fucking like lumps of like condensed earwax be removed from a person's outer ear canal
00:48:45 And I mean it's kind of gross, but it's also kind of like oh
00:48:49 It's nice to see that removed because that was really bad
00:48:52 I think kind of satisfying I mean see it to see it. It's it's satisfying to feel it removed
00:48:57 I don't look at it when I scratch my ear
00:49:00 Hmm
00:49:02 Gross but I feel like the low point of my life is watching weird YouTube videos like that sometimes like
00:49:09 There was a pimple popping. Yeah, it's like worse than that like specifically there was an example
00:49:15 Like I was drunk and I came home from the club with like my friends and like I went upstairs the bed
00:49:20 Because I don't want to talk to these people anymore. I'm spent I'm done
00:49:23 I'm gonna be an introvert and hide in my room and I was I was drunk and eating like crisps and
00:49:29 watching videos of a guy testing like mouse drowning
00:49:34 contraptions and I
00:49:36 It was horrible and I don't know why I did it and I generally consider that one of the lowest points of my life
00:49:42 Well, I wasn't like it entertained. I was watching this guy. So say why why would you do it then?
00:49:48 I don't know. I found it and I was like whoa
00:49:51 What the fuck and I start watching it and I I feel evil for having done that I
00:49:58 Feel I feel like Justin Royland for having done that. I also feel that you are evil
00:50:12 The point is just that it's it's cuz like yesterday I
00:50:18 Was feeling so bad in the morning and the night before
00:50:22 That I could barely like I think it was like
00:50:26 Super dehydrating something going on with my liver is causing me to like dehydrate really easily and very difficult to
00:50:33 Rehydrate so I've been drinking loads of water and it hasn't been going in it's like frustrating and I was so cracked and dry and dusty
00:50:40 I felt like I was gonna turn into dust like that one episode of Angel where that guy turns to dust
00:50:47 Because it's a creature demon goes inside him and sucks all the moisture out of it
00:50:51 Oh, yeah, Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone Harry Potter and the demon that sucks the moisture out from on the side
00:51:05 The demon that sucks the moisture
00:51:08 It was just like so perfect. I was watching this angel and this guy
00:51:16 He was like possessed by this demon that was forcing him to drink
00:51:19 But he was not getting the water in and he was his face was cracking and there was like some like face makeup to make him look
00:51:26 Like it was cracking like down the side of his face and then he fell over and turned into a pile of dust
00:51:31 And I felt that that was the most visceral feeling what I have ever had
00:51:37 Stone
00:51:42 When when professor quarrel just crumbled to dust and fell and fell and and then Voldemort's
00:51:49 Ghostface went screaming through Harry's torso. I I felt seen
00:51:57 Anyway that that
00:51:59 Coupled with like I was I was trying to survive was trying to like feel better
00:52:03 I think last week. I wasn't on the PCP because I was feeling similar
00:52:09 It was just so like I there's no energy and then today
00:52:12 I well over the last few days this ear thing has come up and I'm like
00:52:17 Just stop getting sick
00:52:20 Yeah, and I want to stab myself in the head with a knife doesn't seem fair
00:52:24 I stabbed myself in a head with a knife to get the ear. It's just not fair like what have you done
00:52:29 that means that
00:52:31 You need to fucking fall apart all of a sudden
00:52:35 Yeah, I haven't released my secret project
00:52:38 Yeah, they were upset that I that I didn't release my secret
00:52:45 That's why I've escaped
00:52:48 Law for you now
00:52:51 So I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Oh, I'll kill you. I'll just kill you. I'll kill you. Oh, yeah
00:52:57 There's nothing special about it, I'm just mentioning it so you know
00:53:04 This is why I'm never doing a secret project because I will collapse
00:53:10 Simsie I was I guess I'm does it bear mentioning that one of the things we've talked about in my
00:53:17 Server is that you were one of you were one of the kuso mega people. Yes
00:53:23 You were on which is for anyone doesn't know that was Trixie's
00:53:26 Light I guess it started as a light novel series, but it was gonna be more than that
00:53:31 Right, it was it was a light novel parody series that was gonna get a physical release
00:53:36 Basically, you she was commissioning like manga pages though, right?
00:53:41 So or were you were you just doing like character art for a light no, there were insert there was lots of different art
00:53:47 There was commissioned there was like a cover there was like a character page
00:53:50 Which is what I worked on like at the beginning of the night light novel where it lists all the characters and descriptions of them
00:53:55 And I did all the basic character designs for that
00:53:58 There was like a ton of like insert pages for key points in the story and things like that and um, yeah
00:54:04 So I was the guy who did like if you open up like a modigatary or some other light novel where they show all the characters at the front and says look
00:54:11 It's her. Wow. Look at it. Look at look at that
00:54:13 I have never read a light novel in my life. It's sort of it's still the same thing
00:54:18 It's like in a manga where you pick up a manga volume and it has like piccolo and he's smiling and stuff
00:54:25 You love it up to a picture you see and then and it makes you smile and you smile
00:54:31 God fucking piccolo rules
00:54:36 Piccolo really does rule we can all agree like triangle shoulders, and that's based
00:54:42 Yeah, Piccolo dresses like Dr. Hibbert's wife
00:54:47 with the big shoulder pads
00:54:50 I
00:54:53 The entire series
00:54:54 Yeah, she has a name. I think oh god. I think her name is like Janine is Vivian from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
00:55:01 She does look like she has she has spoken before
00:55:05 occasionally
00:55:08 There are there I
00:55:10 Since I since I watched the real gyms episode. I guess there I guess there are rumors of infidelity
00:55:16 I guess there are rumors. It's dr. Hibbert's been fucking around with his with his
00:55:21 I don't know. What would you call it?
00:55:24 Secretary or whatever?
00:55:27 It's all concubines. Okay, it's catamite, but it's all unsubstantiated
00:55:33 Der
00:55:35 Never had an episode
00:55:37 Never had an episode about him. He's like it. He's like everybody knows dr.
00:55:42 Hibbert never had an epic comic book guy has had an episode dr. Nick's had episodes
00:55:47 Yeah
00:55:50 I guess I guess dr. Hibbert's thing is like Applejack. He's like the doctor that is
00:55:59 He's he's a Republican so he's just like Applejack
00:56:02 He's just like Applejack because because like Applejack
00:56:06 Was the the straight man pony the the one that was not
00:56:10 Stupid and so she would always be the the character that would be like here's the truth you dumb fuck
00:56:17 Dr. Hibbert they always go to dr. Hibbert because he is the the responsible one who knows medicine
00:56:22 Dr. Nick is the one who doesn't and that's his joke dr. Hibbert is the straight man
00:56:27 He just has his joke we laughs at horrible
00:56:30 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, even what you can do like with an episode about a character like that
00:56:35 Wait, Applejack isn't the stupid one. I thought she was a stupid one
00:56:40 Wait, do you actually not know? No, I've never watched my little pony, but I've gotten the impression that she's just she's the one with the hat, right?
00:56:46 Oh, isn't there isn't there like an old quote? Oh my god, please please. Let me say what I want to fucking say
00:56:53 Oh my god, isn't there an old quote from like Gen 2 or whatever where it's like Applejack's a silly pony? I
00:57:01 Feel like that's a thing that is like a line that I've seen
00:57:05 Yes, Applejack is a silly pony. Okay, good. Thank you for confirming
00:57:11 See I was right. She's sorry sound like I'm cutting you off. I think my I'm sorry. Yeah, I know the connections bad
00:57:17 I know there's lag. I know it's not your fault, but I'm like, yeah
00:57:20 I I'm sorry. I flew off the handle a little there. I got a little frustrated feeling like I was being talked over
00:57:26 I know it's not because I'm sorry. I apologize
00:57:30 I brought the whole vibe down my little pony. Oh, please forgive me
00:57:36 Anyway, no, Applejack is the responsible one. She's she's yeah
00:57:40 She's the hard-working
00:57:41 doesn't react like down to earth cuz she's an earth pony
00:57:46 Twilight is like a a like a nerd that gets extremely stressed out about scheduling
00:57:52 Pinkie pie is jumping off the wall all the time Rainbow Dash is like
00:57:57 It's gay
00:57:59 Yeah, you know got their vices, you know, okay, okay
00:58:04 Cool
00:58:05 See, I don't know anything about my little pony. No Apple. No Applejack. Well, you better know
00:58:10 You should you should get into my little pony so that you can humanized versions of Fluttershy with
00:58:17 Humanized Applejack in in the boots Applejack is hard-working and honest and
00:58:23 runs a business and
00:58:25 loves her family and
00:58:28 Responsible and boring
00:58:32 Love's traditional equestrian values
00:58:38 Equester equestrian values from an outsider's perspective. She's definitely the coolest one. She has her
00:58:46 What the fuck no no the outside is perspective
00:58:52 Fucking
00:58:53 What the fuck are you talking about you're crazy where anything they don't look cool. That is very cool
00:58:59 It's it. It's a cowboy. Did she get the hat from it's cool. What do you mean?
00:59:03 She's she's not she get it from they don't have made by a haberdasher from a haberdashery, of course
00:59:09 They don't have fucking haberdashery's in the stable. I bet they fucking do I bet they fucking do actually
00:59:17 Probably made it herself. Yeah
00:59:20 That's cool
00:59:23 Yeah, she's the cool one cuz she has a hat. Yeah, it's fucking crazy. She's like
00:59:29 Twilight Sparkle has a fucking crown
00:59:32 So she does
00:59:33 That's a lie. I've never seen that. You're lying. You're a liar. Well, she's got a tiara
00:59:38 She doesn't she doesn't wear it all the time. Just sometimes lame on special special occasions lame. She's not cowboy. I'm googling
00:59:48 Oh, yeah, that's yeah Applejack's hat is identified as the one that bright Mac gave her
00:59:53 bright Mac being her dad
00:59:55 Just just chicken eggs. I thought that's a red. Where's the hat come from?
00:59:59 Luffy it's it's this emotional value the best character boy for turn up then
01:00:04 She's basically
01:00:05 Except she's nothing like him
01:00:11 Okay, but I'm sure there is a haberda. I'm sure someone in Ponyville runs a haberdashery
01:00:17 Somebody's got to know we can't all get our hats from our dead dads
01:00:21 Okay, no, that's where they spawn they if you have a if you are born with a hat on your head
01:00:28 When you come out of the room that means you're gonna be a dad of Applejack. That's what that means
01:00:32 I I think it's more like, you know, when we die
01:00:36 You know, we all drop loot, but your loot depends on your loot table and and dad's dads are on their own loot table
01:00:44 And dad's just have a very high chance to drop hats
01:00:47 Sentimental hats
01:00:53 Sentimental hats and AXP so you have the experience of your father dying and you level up
01:01:00 And you go yes, and you go all my strength rows
01:01:06 Thanks dad
01:01:08 Ah
01:01:12 The
01:01:14 It could be a funny like thing. Yeah, Kusa mega. Oh
01:01:18 Yeah, what Kusa mega?
01:01:20 What how's about Kusa mega? Well, basically
01:01:24 Well at first I was in the wrong
01:01:26 Because I was about a week late in sending like all the designs and stuff like it took me ages to get them done because I was balancing
01:01:33 Work
01:01:35 Tricks he didn't seem to mind too much. It was just like hey
01:01:38 We got to get this thought we've got to get this project done so we can start the Kickstarter is what she kept saying to me
01:01:42 I was like, okay. Yeah, I'm gonna do that and I gave it to her
01:01:46 And if a few weeks later and we had heard nothing about the Kickstarter and we we never have again
01:01:54 Who's you you and the other you and the other artists you mean? Yeah, exactly
01:01:58 So the the idea was it was stupid deal. I shouldn't have taken it
01:02:03 It was like well below my commission rate for five drawings
01:02:07 And it was like payment only on successful funding of the Kickstarter, which is just the stupid really yeah, exactly
01:02:14 If you if you ever do
01:02:16 Something like this like like like you knock it for someone
01:02:20 Yeah, I didn't sign on for immediate pay. No, there was no guarantee that I would get paid
01:02:24 Did you did you not get paid at all?
01:02:26 No, I did get paid in the end like what what actually happened was the Kickstarter was basically canceled and then she just paid
01:02:33 All the artists out of pocket, but um, yeah
01:02:36 It it took a while and apparently I was the last artist to get paid and um, yeah
01:02:42 So yeah, just like forgot apparently and I'm pretty I'm pretty sure everyone else got paid
01:02:50 It took me making like a
01:02:52 Post on Twitter saying like any other artist for the kusa mega project. Please contact me like that like vague and mysterious
01:02:58 Yeah, I saw yeah, I saw that I saw that and I saw I remember you replied to it and saying what happened
01:03:04 I was curious like I was mad
01:03:07 I was mad because I I saw that and I inferred I just inferred like why would somebody make this tweet?
01:03:15 Somebody didn't get paid for their work and it makes me mad and when it's when it's someone I know I'm like
01:03:21 Don't do that. I mean it was stupid
01:03:23 I was like I was a big fan of Trek see at the time and I was like watching all their videos
01:03:30 And then it was like I'm making a light level and artists can sign up and I was like hey
01:03:33 I do that, but it wasn't even that because I had done the first like light novel chapters that she released on YouTube
01:03:40 It's like an audiobook
01:03:41 I drew like a piece fan out for it and send it and she retweeted it
01:03:44 I was like that's cool, and then like immediately like that like as soon as I was like messaging her
01:03:48 I was like hey, I want to work on the actual physical release project
01:03:51 She was like I was like can I do this page because it was like a big list of all the different parts of the book that you
01:03:56 Could work on like a drawing a specific scene or something like that
01:03:59 And I was I was like hey can I do this one and she was like actually
01:04:03 I want you to do all of the character designs at the beginning of the book and I was like oh Jesus
01:04:07 But yeah, I did them slightly weak slightly lake like a week or two weeks late late. Sorry, and um
01:04:15 That's bad. Don't be late people, but um and then nothing three months, and then project was canned and like
01:04:24 So the reason why I signed on for basically no guarantee of pay was because I was such a big fan of
01:04:29 Trixie at the time, so I was literally doing the
01:04:32 The parasocial fucking. Oh, I like this person. I trust them
01:04:37 So parasocial of you
01:04:40 Cream you got dr. Wolf. Yeah, it's that yeah, you got that
01:04:46 You get you get dr. Wolf. It's so it's he's still
01:04:50 He's I got the money in the end is fine
01:04:53 Yeah, true. Yeah. Um doctor. Dr. Wolf is still at it
01:04:57 I saw a reddit post that someone made being like guys
01:05:01 I think dr. Wolf is stealing our theories for his videos and this is like a recent post like like two weeks ago
01:05:08 People are still like
01:05:10 Upset although, you know, I feel like that's just
01:05:14 That's common practice, right for youtubers to churn out content
01:05:18 They just go to a subreddit and just like regurgitate some shit. They read on a subreddit. Oh, yeah, and make a list of it
01:05:23 Yeah, yeah, so I don't know that's common practice
01:05:26 So I think that guy might be disappointed the the one piece the one piece community on YouTube is a nightmare of just
01:05:33 Regurgitating nonsense in evil bio
01:05:37 It's not good. I'm sure evil bio. I don't watch any of the no
01:05:42 YouTube one piece. Yeah, you're better off. I've watched like a few bits and pieces like and just been told a lot about it
01:05:48 By the other members of the party discord and it's like, yeah
01:05:51 These people just stupid and they just lie and they just make up things and pretend that it's real. I
01:05:59 I
01:06:00 Haven't really watched much one piece content. I don't really get the sense that there is a lot of like
01:06:07 In-depth one piece content going on. It's a lot of like a
01:06:11 lot of very like surface level like just like chapter recaps and like
01:06:17 Just kind of like theory crafting but in like the basically just the sense that you're just like reading shit off the wiki
01:06:24 People who make nonsense bullshit theories and then like other people pick up those theories and take them as facts and then
01:06:30 Regurgitate and make their own theories based on those theories and it's like almost like a big chaotic mess of just misinformation and lies
01:06:38 Yeah, I think I'd watched a bit of some of that theory stuff
01:06:45 And I was only interested because a lot of one piece
01:06:48 It's so big there's so much of it, and I forget a lot of things
01:06:52 So it's so much of it an order like doesn't clarify like things things that brought together
01:06:58 It's like oh, I do remember that happening
01:07:01 And I guess if you stretch it you can make it part of this theory like I never really took the theory too seriously
01:07:07 But I was I don't know. It's just sort of like. Oh, yeah
01:07:11 I guess it's like harm us, but it's embarrassing and like it's enough, but yeah some
01:07:17 people people I
01:07:20 Don't know theories crafting is it's fun. I've defended it before
01:07:25 Yeah
01:07:26 When it when it gets to the point where somebody theory crafts a theory that doesn't end up being true, and then they I
01:07:33 Don't know lash out to the creator
01:07:36 Now it's not always
01:07:38 One piece you just be anything then that's stupid and dangerous and vile like the thing that I think about
01:07:45 With like reddit theory crafting is um
01:07:48 Blade kind eyewear was that poster on the Homestuck subreddit. Oh?
01:07:53 Who had that whole that whole theory about them aspect inversion that like a pretty sizable?
01:08:01 like
01:08:02 Chunk of the of the Homestuck subreddit community like believed in and thought was sort of like a secret
01:08:09 spur of mechanic that
01:08:11 like
01:08:12 At the time kind of sounded
01:08:15 The gist of it was basically that like there is a thing that can happen in spur where you can like if you basically
01:08:23 Like go evil you become like the opposite of your aspect and the basically the only real evidence was this was that Rose
01:08:30 LaLonde was the seer of light, but then when she turned evil for a second
01:08:34 She went dark, so it was like oh did she did she embody her opposite aspect the aspect of void?
01:08:41 Like how what does this mean of a seer the blind?
01:08:45 Can can can the you know can other aspects do this?
01:08:48 Is this like a universal thing and like other quote-unquote evidence was brought forward?
01:08:54 But that was like the only one and like it like really quickly like as the story went on
01:08:59 It was like it never really happened like that again, and it was clear like no. It's just kind of a
01:09:06 Maybe sort of a thematic
01:09:08 Coincidence that like she is the character of light and then she was taken over by this dark thing. I mean it's not like
01:09:14 Yeah
01:09:16 basically, yeah
01:09:17 so
01:09:19 Yeah, but the the the the aspect inversion theory generalizes to like ah, yes, so like under these circumstances
01:09:27 John if he were to undergo such a process he being the air of breath would you know become he would become the
01:09:35 I don't know the the whatever of blood because blood is the aspect of bonds and oaths and and
01:09:43 relations and
01:09:45 Breath is the one of freedom and and non-commitment or whatever
01:09:49 movement
01:09:51 And it was like no
01:09:53 But like so many words so much fucking digital ink spilled
01:09:57 Over this like yeah baseless fucking thing based on like one. It's piece of evidence
01:10:03 It's harmless and then defended until it makes fans like rabidly attack each other over their
01:10:10 Disagreements about whether or not this fan theory is like more accurate or bad or stupid or not I
01:10:17 Like communities are terrible
01:10:20 That theory appealed to me because I'm like I like to imagine because I was really into the the spurb aspect of it
01:10:27 I liked the gamey parts of it and the parts of the homestead that explored spurb the game
01:10:31 So the idea that there was like all these hidden mechanics of the game going on that like we're influencing the plot
01:10:38 I found that really interesting
01:10:41 But the evidence just wasn't there for it
01:10:44 But a lot of people were really committed on an emotional level to defending it as a thesis
01:10:51 Blade kind eyewear would fucking post these like
01:10:54 Pages and pages long posts like every time there was a new update being like here's my new analysis of what's going on in
01:11:00 In in the you know seen through a lens of understanding that includes
01:11:06 Aspect inversion as a game mechanic LeMau
01:11:10 Pretty funny pretty good
01:11:13 pretty based
01:11:16 Homestuck
01:11:18 Homestuck um, I want to complain read homestuck so that you can draw a brisco with big boobies
01:11:31 One of these days one of you should you could just do that anyway
01:11:34 You could just do that anyway. I could just do that anyway
01:11:37 I tried homestuck years ago because I had a crush on a girl and she was like you should check out this comic called homestuck
01:11:43 She was right. It's like
01:11:46 This is stupid. Oh you fucking asshole. You fucking asshole. I was 12 when I was dumb
01:11:54 I've never tried again. Yeah, I was like 12 or something. Why how old are you now? I'm 22
01:12:02 Maybe I wasn't 12. How old was I those that would have been
01:12:05 No, I guess homestuck was around 10 years ago, but that was like I would have been like early homestuck, right?
01:12:12 Maybe I don't know
01:12:15 2013 I
01:12:17 Think oh, whatever cuz attack on time was out. I know that she was obsessed with that
01:12:23 That would have been
01:12:25 2010 then
01:12:28 No, I think I'm talking was like 2013 2014. I think Jesus, okay
01:12:35 Jesus Christ. Yeah
01:12:37 In 2014 wait, no, I don't know how it no in 2014 I would have been 15
01:12:44 Okay
01:12:47 Fucking remember when I tried to read out
01:12:52 I was like one I
01:12:54 In my sleep because it's like Mozart you put you put your baby into the Mozart aka homestuck
01:13:00 Discography and then watch them grow
01:13:03 If you ask me to list homestuck characters
01:13:05 I'd be like John Egbert and I know him because he's the main one and then Drisker and I know him because of you
01:13:12 I know her because of you
01:13:15 That's my greatest contribution to the world is to tell people about risker
01:13:20 Before we move on before we move on from kusa mega, I want to complain
01:13:24 I want to complain about Trixie just for a minute just for a moment
01:13:29 Just for a moment. I want to point out something that has been bothering me and it'd be done
01:13:32 I it can be done. I can I can do it
01:13:35 I haven't mentioned this but it I feel like I want people to know about it because it's really irritating and that is that there was
01:13:42 I've made up tweet a tweet about this yesterday
01:13:45 Um, there was rad content that Trixie had that nobody else had
01:13:51 That she said she was going to give us and she hasn't done it and she has fucking
01:13:57 Obscunded and become a vagrant
01:14:00 And I just I just I feel like it's safe to assume now that she's never going to do it and probably doesn't even have it anymore
01:14:07 And that just makes me really mad that makes me real fucking angry
01:14:12 And I just want to fucking say it confirmation. I tried to this was a footage was like stuff
01:14:20 we had recorded on phones and
01:14:23 Cameras that was supposed to be behind the scenes and also the the footage recorded at the meet-up
01:14:30 I think this is all of the stuff that she was that what it was
01:14:34 Okay, I wasn't even sure like what it was that she had just that she had some rad con stuff and she said
01:14:40 She would give it to us. Yeah
01:14:42 Yeah, okay behind the scenes and meet-up stuff. Okay, cool
01:14:46 I was a in the in the fucking garbage in the fucking garbage because she doesn't give a fuck. Okay. Go on
01:14:52 I yeah, I haven't gotten any confirmation that she's like
01:14:56 Gotten rid of it or she can't give it. I did contact her
01:15:00 Not too long ago before she was she went on that road trip
01:15:04 And she said yeah, she's on it. She's on a permanent road trip now
01:15:08 Yeah, I mean, I don't know there was like before she went on the road trip. She was like packing stuff up
01:15:13 And she's like, oh, yeah, I'm a little busy right now, but I'll get it to you
01:15:16 I was like, okay, please could you because it might be difficult to do it from the road
01:15:20 That was the last I heard and I guess I could ask her again
01:15:23 Like I don't know. I feel like this is just gonna be a continual like yeah, I'll do it for like months years
01:15:28 That's all she ever does you ask all anything you just ask her and she's always says yeah, I'll do it
01:15:33 Yeah, she'll promise anything. She doesn't give a fuck. So like a Kickstarter. She's a big fucking liar
01:15:38 and
01:15:40 I'll tell you what I did when she when she was doing the
01:15:44 The the not the yard sale. Yeah, the yard sale
01:15:48 Someone bought her hard drives and I and I DM'd the person who bought her hard drives to ask them
01:15:54 Hey, if you get those hard drives and they have data on them
01:15:58 Let me know because I feel like I absolutely believe that she would just sell the hard drives that have our fucking rad content on them
01:16:06 I totally think that's something she would do. So I don't know. It's possible
01:16:10 It's possible
01:16:11 That may it would be so it would be hilarious if that were the way that we could recover
01:16:17 That stuff. I'm not holding my breath. I feel like it's an outside shot, but just in case
01:16:24 It would be very funny
01:16:28 It would be such a normal thing to do if you're selling a hard drive to wipe it first
01:16:33 But then again, what does she know about technology? Maybe she just didn't think to do that. Yeah, it could happen
01:16:40 She computers she uses a computer. She might have thought of it. Let's hope she didn't
01:16:45 That's her. I mean, yeah, my I feel like she probably would have my eye
01:16:53 I mean, we can dream we can just say I'm just saying there's a chance
01:16:58 It was whatever whatever. I'm fucking pissed off about it
01:17:02 I'm fucking pissed off and
01:17:05 Disrespected and disgusted and I don't know
01:17:10 Yeah, that sucks. That's another reason to be annoyed. I guess
01:17:15 Okay, well, I guess I guess I guess I could I could go on I could go on but I guess let's continue
01:17:23 You said you were done bad. You said I was done with tricks. Hey, I know
01:17:27 I know
01:17:31 Oh, but yeah, but then they did that interview they did that interview with Oki Oki's weird stories who I'm a fan of and who
01:17:40 For some reason, I don't know what compelled him to do this
01:17:44 But he de-embed me he followed me and he de-embed me to let me know that he had just done that interview with them
01:17:52 And I was like, oh wow cool. Okay looking forward to it. I
01:17:58 Did too it was it was entirely about Trixie's content, which is like
01:18:03 Yeah
01:18:05 If you're a fan of her and you're you know, he's like the the conversation
01:18:10 Boiled down to Trixie your content's different and it's bad and we don't like it and Trixie's like that's okay
01:18:16 I want a new audience and that's the entire video
01:18:20 Um
01:18:21 Well, I don't care about her like career goals. It's like whatever. I just want the rad con stuff
01:18:28 I want the stuff that is
01:18:30 Tight up in and back the stuff. That's the stuff. That's the stuff. That's ours and not hers. Yeah, I would like that too
01:18:35 um, I mean in about that I
01:18:40 Get I
01:18:41 What stood out to me about that interview was how she keeps like pivoting and playing like this weird rhetorical
01:18:48 game
01:18:49 Where she will in the same breath claim to
01:18:53 Not care about money not care about losing the audience
01:18:57 But then at the same time insist like well, I had to post all my music stuff on my main channel because it's the only way
01:19:02 It'll get views. That's the only way I can make money off it. That's the only way I can build an audience for it
01:19:07 It uh, it was a very interesting video because uh, lots of the points that oki brought up were like proofed by her actions during the interview
01:19:15 Like it like it it's almost like
01:19:17 He's calling her out for this stuff and then the video itself is just like a complete
01:19:22 Microcosm of all of those things like giving example
01:19:26 um, he he he briefly brought up her inconsistency on like, um
01:19:31 Like a content and like like void gazes is meant to be like a cooling show like with fans, isn't it?
01:19:38 I don't know sometimes. I don't know
01:19:40 We like
01:19:43 A big point of the the interview was uh him saying we don't know what your new content is even supposed to we don't know
01:19:48 What this channel's for like it's too broad and like
01:19:52 That interview was emblematic of it because it was fitted into the void gazer format
01:19:57 Which is like not that
01:19:59 It should have been its own separate thing. It's even more confusing. You know, you're right. Yeah, I I guess I guess that's true
01:20:08 Uh
01:20:09 I don't know. It's probably most not the most solid criticism, but yeah, why yeah, why I feel like why why is this a void gazer?
01:20:17 I guess I guess I agree with that. It's odd
01:20:21 I don't know. I feel like her answers were were
01:20:26 Like they maybe were confusing but her
01:20:30 Like goal seemed pretty clear
01:20:33 I don't care about appeasing my older audience
01:20:37 I believe somehow
01:20:39 For some reason the what I am doing now will create a bigger and newer audience that will make me money
01:20:45 And I just need to get enough people who just like whatever it is. I do exactly. Yeah, I'm like, yeah, that's okay
01:20:53 That seems pretty clear if you if you believe that
01:20:56 I guess I I see her perspective, but she's wrong. So she is wrong
01:21:03 You can all agree on that
01:21:05 Uh, oh, I hate her. I I fucking hate her. God damn it
01:21:10 Uh, uh, I don't know. I'm so fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad guys
01:21:16 I'm I'm I'm sitting here release the red hands
01:21:20 Hands the red hands on the table hands to God
01:21:24 Heart heart on my sleeve. I just fucking hate her and she's a bad person and she's done wrong
01:21:30 And she's done wrong by me in particular and all of us collectively
01:21:34 And fuck her forever. It makes me feel bad because I keep checking the fucking Kiwi farms
01:21:39 And it makes me feel sick of the ship. Some of the shit people have read writing on there is disgusting and like nasty
01:21:45 I I saw I saw some real racist shit in there
01:21:49 Like pretty recently and I was like, oh
01:21:52 Yeah, that's just that's what these people are. It's like
01:21:56 Yeah, I go I go there to laugh at tricksy making stupid business decisions
01:22:00 All it is is fucking transphobic and racist comments and I don't care about that
01:22:04 They just they just can't help themselves. They can't fucking think they can't fucking see beyond that
01:22:09 Like that's such a fucking blinder to them. They're like, ah
01:22:13 That's it. That's where that's where the buck stops. Oh god. Ah
01:22:18 I like laughing at people but not in that way
01:22:21 No
01:22:22 Jesus
01:22:24 Make make a joke about something funny. Why don't you? Yeah, like how they're literally hobos
01:22:29 You're fucking rubes there
01:22:31 Freelance freelance roadies
01:22:34 Fat hobos
01:22:37 Freelance roadies living in a Prius because I stole their RV because I bend saints stole their RV
01:22:43 And have hidden it in an undisclosed location and will not be returning it until the rad con cut is released
01:22:50 This is a blackmail situation
01:22:53 We must we must have an exchange
01:22:56 Then you can't afford to hide an RV. You can't afford to find a place where you can hide an RV. Come on, man
01:23:03 Not unless you donate to me at patreon.com slash ben saint to fund it boys
01:23:10 Fund my fund my my my uh, my whatever parking space for the RV until until the exchange can be can be coordinated
01:23:19 Oh, man
01:23:21 What were you saying? Are we saying give?
01:23:24 Oh, I don't know. I I forgot that it was the leg was like
01:23:29 Sorry leaving me in the dust. I didn't know what it was happening. You know people, you know, I'm sorry
01:23:34 I'm seething. I know I know it must come across like I'm just fucking coping and seething and you know what I am
01:23:41 I absolutely am and I have been for a while and it's it's peaking. It's peaking and it's not going away
01:23:47 Uh
01:23:48 And maybe I should talk to a doctor or something
01:23:53 Uh, yeah, maybe you should touch some grass. Maybe you should touch touch some weed. Maybe I should touch some
01:24:00 No
01:24:02 No, no, no
01:24:04 if I
01:24:05 I feel like if I smoked weed while I was angry
01:24:09 I would like
01:24:11 Cry I would like like the weed would like affect my judgment and it would like it heighten the emotion
01:24:17 To the point that I would like break down and cry about it because I would like feel it even more strongly
01:24:23 Uh, so no, I don't want to do that
01:24:26 I don't I don't
01:24:27 You know what they say like you got to be in like a good emotional place before you get higher else it like
01:24:33 You can like, you know, that emotion can like spiral out of control or whatever or like it heightens it thumbnail
01:24:38 A thumbnail and title for this video Ben literally cries about Trixie
01:24:45 It's too much coping and seething coping and seething which I am admittedly I am both doing both of those
01:24:52 Well, but no more
01:24:54 That's that's as much as I'll admit to
01:24:57 um
01:24:59 Oh
01:25:00 This is unrelated
01:25:01 But it's sort of related to you being late with the kuso mega drawings. I was also late
01:25:07 Uh with the cover
01:25:10 Which I just finished drawing this morning for the kato and anthology
01:25:15 Which uh, I don't think I don't think it's my fault that the uh kickstarter
01:25:22 Launch was delayed. I hope it wasn't well now
01:25:25 Uh, but anyway, it was it was gonna launch last
01:25:28 Friday
01:25:29 But I think it might be launching this friday or it's launching sometime this week the kickstarter
01:25:34 for that, um
01:25:37 And uh, I don't know link link down in the description
01:25:41 So by the time the episode's out, it's either already started or starting today
01:25:46 They they told I I gave them the cover
01:25:48 I gave them the cover and they told me that by the time this episode is out the kickstarter for that will be launched
01:25:54 Uh, which would be pretty cool
01:25:57 Be pretty cool. If that fucking they've had the fucking sell a bunch of copies
01:26:02 Uh, uh white white lion, uh, uh hd remaster
01:26:06 Actually, I have to I have to go and get that re-scanned. I have to go and get like a better scanner
01:26:12 I should try and make a comic at some point. I mean have you never have you never
01:26:17 No, I've never made anything more than like a page and it was like born
01:26:22 It's nothing all you you
01:26:26 It's funny to me that's like
01:26:30 If i'm gonna draw something
01:26:32 It better be a comic. Yeah
01:26:35 Yeah
01:26:36 I don't know like when you first mentioned the kato thing to show going from point a to point b
01:26:42 Otherwise
01:26:44 That's right. That's right
01:26:47 Like when you first mentioned the kato thing I was like, man, I'd love to do that
01:26:50 But I got commissions and uni work and stuff to do
01:26:54 And I want to sit around and play red dead and waste time. I don't know
01:27:00 Yeah
01:27:02 Yeah, I mean a video video games are a poison on my life and I need to just uninstall steam
01:27:08 I'm me me too. I uh
01:27:11 I I I spent a day I spent like a day and a half drawing the the cover for the anthology
01:27:18 And uh, it was it was tough because there was a lot of detail I had to get in there took me a long time
01:27:22 It was pretty it was it was a it was a
01:27:25 Trying experience it was a lot of work and then I had to decompress with an entire day of noida
01:27:32 And it was terrible. It's like time to get back to work on my game. Oh or
01:27:37 Or I could just play noida for
01:27:40 Like 20 straight hours and that's what I did that
01:27:44 If you do a work thing and then you follow it with another work thing, you're obviously not going to want to do the second one
01:27:51 Yeah, that's what I think that's what I tell myself. That's what I tell myself. I earned this I earned this
01:27:57 I did like three commissions in one day. I don't know about 20 hours straight, but
01:28:02 I did three commissions in one day and then I like turned it off and I was like, okay
01:28:06 And I just sat and played through all of resident evil village in like one sitting and I was like cool
01:28:10 good game
01:28:12 Everyone's everyone's fucking abuzz about resident evil village. It's a very good. It's a good game
01:28:18 It's a triple a game that came out and it's finished and it's good and it it's makes me happy that that's happened
01:28:23 What is on press? What is good?
01:28:26 Never have I heard such a thing. What what's good about it? Um
01:28:30 It's it's got it's it's very broad in terms of its focus like the action is good
01:28:35 It's it's um, it does a good job of making things. Is it an action title? Do you do you shoot?
01:28:40 Do you shoot the big booby lady?
01:28:43 Yeah, you shoot the big booby lady. I don't I don't know about spoilers
01:28:46 I don't know about spoilers because the game is
01:28:49 We don't have to get in the spoiler. You do shoot. They make you shoot the big booby lady
01:28:54 Oh, she's barely in it
01:28:56 Really how many yeah, she's there's five like main bosses and she's one of them
01:29:01 So she's like she's one of the longest sections of the game
01:29:05 I mean, she's only she's only about an hour and a half of content from seeing it on social media
01:29:10 I assume the entire game is about escaping from her fucking crazy haunted house. No, no, that's just the that's the first bit
01:29:17 That's like I see the first section
01:29:20 It's good. Just be horny though
01:29:22 Yeah, they Capcom Capcom were very crafty with the marketing and they were like, hmm
01:29:26 Let's release this trailer with like all these vague images on it
01:29:29 She was in that first trailer and then they just focused entirely on her because they knew that people were obsessed with her
01:29:35 Yeah, I mean
01:29:37 Makes makes sense. I guess I would say I would say most of the best stuff in the game is completely unrelated to her
01:29:42 Which is surprising
01:29:44 considering how focused they were on it
01:29:47 What it's spoiler me. What is the lore for her being so big?
01:29:53 She is uh, basically
01:29:55 Uh, do you have a play resin evil seven?
01:29:59 No, I've never played a video game
01:30:01 Okay, there's evil mold parasites, uh, that like just like a natural thing that makes people weird
01:30:07 um
01:30:08 Okay, there's this other lady who's trying to bring back a daughter who died with by using the mold parasite in some weird way
01:30:15 And she experimented on a bunch of people and she gave it to the big lady and it meant that she just kept growing
01:30:20 And it's now immortal land of empire
01:30:23 It's like a bio fungus thingy nice
01:30:26 present evils nice, so she's it's uh, she's a clicker. She's a
01:30:31 Mushroom she's towed at from yeah, super mario
01:30:35 She's more like uh lichen like a moldy guy
01:30:40 Uh
01:30:42 I see like uh spoilers
01:30:45 She turned like when you fight her she turns into a big dragon monster and she's like sticking out the top of it
01:30:49 and what?
01:30:51 What you mean like um, you mean like uh that fucking demon spider lady from dark souls
01:30:57 Yeah, a little bit like that except she her body's like fucked up as well. But like there's like a giant dragon monster
01:31:03 It's a reasonable game. It's what surprised the villains turned into big monsters at the end. Wow
01:31:08 I've also never played a resident evil. So it happens in every in every single game
01:31:13 Like past the first one the villains turned into a big monster at the end. So
01:31:17 Well now
01:31:18 All right, you thought you could now I know but in fact I am a giant scorpion exactly like it
01:31:25 They were like, oh, it's sexy. Let's turn into a monster and ruin it and make it sad. Well
01:31:31 Yeah
01:31:32 You gotta you gotta you gotta get rid of her somehow
01:31:36 You gotta you gotta have some kind of conclusion to to her arc of having big tits in a big
01:31:40 Why can't the conclusion be why can't the conclusion be
01:31:44 That you save her and then she fucks you and you have
01:31:52 Because easins winters is a good man. He's too busy trying to save his daughter. That's not family friendly. That's evil
01:31:57 What you just described is fucking evil and it's against god's law
01:32:00 You have to fucking turn her into a dragon and blow her fucking face off
01:32:04 Also, also in the beginning of the game you can't solve all your problems by turning them into dragons and blowing them up
01:32:09 It's never failed. It hasn't failed me yet at the very beginning of the game
01:32:14 The main character's wife is like killed in front of him. So it's like, I don't think he'd be up for some sex right now
01:32:19 He's trying to save his daughter
01:32:22 That's it's a it's gonna be the rebound. He's on the rebound
01:32:25 There's now the time within hours. Oh, so he gets his fingers bitten off and she cuts his arm at one point
01:32:31 It's not nice. Never been a better time for a big booby lady to fucking come into your into your life
01:32:40 Yeah, the blessing
01:32:42 I don't I don't actually think she's sexy. I hate her face. Her face. I hate her scary face
01:32:47 She does have like a weird old lady face if you look closer at she's got like crusty dusty skin and looks weird
01:32:52 yeah, yeah, yeah crusty dusty skin
01:32:55 and uh,
01:32:56 Heard big teeth
01:32:58 And I'm like, I don't want that looking at me
01:33:02 And I and I and I get that the appeal
01:33:05 I get that the appeal is like a juxtaposition of like her slightly horrifying
01:33:10 Face and skin unlike her fucking sexy ass milf body
01:33:15 Yeah, but I'd rather just have a sexy ass milf body without a horrifying face
01:33:20 If I'm being honest, you can't put that in resident evil. That doesn't have a place in there. It's gotta be spooky
01:33:27 I guess
01:33:29 I think when I play as like a normal human with big tits
01:33:33 I think the lady who makes the puppets in the game is sexy or anyway, that's a hot take
01:33:37 You don't even get to fucking see her. You see like a painting of her
01:33:40 She's like
01:33:41 I don't even know what they know. Yeah
01:33:45 He's uh, she's just like a pretty girl
01:33:48 Nice. Yeah red. She's pretty girl and like a gothic black dress. She met henson
01:33:55 Yeah
01:33:57 She makes muppets she makes evil muppets not muppets puppets
01:34:01 Oh
01:34:02 Darn
01:34:04 Resident evil with muppets in it
01:34:06 She's the uh, she's the jumping around
01:34:09 She's the cause of the the most horrifying segment I've ever played in a video game
01:34:13 Which is what like her section is and uh, it made me feel the most the most horrifying segment of any video game
01:34:20 Really any video game I've played
01:34:22 Okay, and I've played a fair few horror games and uh that one shattered me up the most
01:34:28 Huh
01:34:29 I I'm just gonna say I don't uh, I don't want to think about babies ever again
01:34:33 Oh gross. Yeah
01:34:36 It's not pleasant
01:34:37 hideous
01:34:39 Sounds like a fucking nightmare
01:34:42 The second half is like a nightmare, but I kind of love it because it turns into resident evil nonsense
01:34:49 Where you shoot things nightmare in like a in in what kind of a way because nightmares seem like in like in like uh
01:34:54 Oh, this this is not totally consistent with anything that's come before in the new continuity
01:34:59 It's just wacky zany. Yeah
01:35:01 You there's a there's a boss boss battle where you ride a mech and shoot a giant monster
01:35:06 Um
01:35:07 Okay, you you play as chris redfield running through a village killing like hundreds of werewolves
01:35:11 Which like took you like three minutes to kill at the beginning of the game
01:35:14 You just kill them with like one shot of a gun and shoot like giant laser beams at a big mold pile and stuff
01:35:20 It's crazy
01:35:22 But I didn't see any of this in the trailer. No, they didn't put any in the trailer
01:35:27 This is all this is all wanton spoilers. Everybody stopped listening. Um
01:35:31 But uh, yeah, and there's like a twist at the end. It's a cool game. I liked it a lot. It made me happy
01:35:37 Ah, yes, I guess if you like video games, I guess if you're into that shit
01:35:42 I know you two don't like care about like triple a games at all. Do you?
01:35:46 No, um, I really don't know not usually
01:35:50 Like I usually get into a game like a hundred years after it was relevant. Yeah, I'm like, wow. Have you ever heard of
01:35:57 Super Mario 64 guys
01:36:00 It's a jump so gross. I have a compulsive issue where backwards long jump up the infinite staircase. It is cool. That is cool
01:36:09 Like I've been playing death stranding
01:36:11 And it's death death stranding look baby in it. I know I know that game's not that new anymore
01:36:16 But to me I I consider it a new game because it's gonna come out like two years ago
01:36:21 Yeah, that game looks kind of cool from what it is interesting
01:36:25 The whole look honestly just just the yeah like the the fact that you got to like fucking navigate
01:36:30 Like the terrain and you got a stack shit on your back and you got to deal with like
01:36:36 A very intricate like carrying capacities
01:36:39 Navigation puzzles just seems neat. It's like it's just like a cool thing to base a game around
01:36:44 It feels like an indie game that was just like remade by a triple-a studio or something
01:36:48 It feels like somebody had this idea
01:36:51 And uh, and it's weird and it's it's got all the stupid kajima shit that's clearly shoved in to be like ha ha wacky kajima
01:36:59 But that's not what's cool about it. It's just satisfying. It's like satisfying busy work. It's one of those games
01:37:04 What what did I watch uh?
01:37:07 It was either joseph anderson or noa called welger vey
01:37:11 I think no noa definitely did do a video on death stranding. I don't know. I don't know if just I've I've definitely seen uh noas
01:37:17 Uh, if joseph anderson did one. I probably watched it as well, but I don't remember matthew matosis did as well
01:37:24 Oh
01:37:25 He was a lot more sure
01:37:27 Yeah, I'm sure I've seen both of those then. Yeah, and uh, super bunny hop. Yeah
01:37:33 Everyone everyone had a thing about everyone's talked about death stranding barry kramer talked about it
01:37:38 And he had baseless criticisms that uh, who cares about that guy? Yeah, I wouldn't have seen that why that's funny
01:37:45 It's a bad video. I guess he made that kingdom hearts video. Yeah, that also like wasn't that good, but no
01:37:54 But everyone watched it because it was extremely topical at the time
01:37:57 He did like a 20 minute video about skyward sword where the the only point I got from the video
01:38:03 It's why is this the sky's yellow and that looks stupid
01:38:05 Oh, okay. Jesus. Why are the clouds yellow? It's extremely. It's it's
01:38:11 Barry's
01:38:13 Analysis videos there. They have good points in them, but yeah, they are bloated
01:38:18 To to such a degree with like goofy speech
01:38:24 I'm just not into it
01:38:26 Yeah, I I love youtubers that just don't waste your time like people who don't try and do jokes
01:38:31 Like if they can slip in the jaw for people who are just making the video and he has what it needs into it
01:38:37 Like I mean matthew metosis is my when yeah, yeah, I was gonna say matthew metosis
01:38:41 He's so like deadpan monotone the entire way and then occasionally he slips in like a joke
01:38:48 Yeah, he lets like he leaves a little bit of
01:38:51 Space for you to chuckle to yourself and then he moves on to the next clip. It's great. Yeah
01:38:57 He's not try it like he doesn't shove it in if he has an idea for it
01:39:00 He'll put it in but he doesn't like try to constantly have something funny happening in his videos
01:39:04 Which is a big problem with a lot of review-based content on the internet. I think this is a problem with my content
01:39:12 Like I go back to like work money. I thought I thought you succeeded pretty well
01:39:16 I I would say I would say yes
01:39:20 That yeah, I was pretty good at being funny
01:39:22 Like I I was annoyed at people like kadikaris who would do the loud talking and never laugh at anything
01:39:28 um
01:39:29 I
01:39:30 But I felt like I was pretty funny, but I felt like some of my videos. I was just doing the loud talking
01:39:36 And some of the earlier ones. I was like, oh god. I don't want to I don't want to go back and listen to this
01:39:41 I want to like scott the was but his videos are
01:39:45 A lot of them are like just loud talking is the joke a little bit and i'm like i'm just not into it
01:39:51 I'm just not you seem like a cool guy
01:39:53 But you're i'm just not into the style of comedy that you're putting on display
01:39:57 There's there's some people who do a good balance like some call me johnny does pretty good videos
01:40:04 I've never heard of them. He's very fairly small. He just does like videos about like resin evens
01:40:08 He just does a series called johnny versus where he talks about stuff
01:40:11 And he's just like uh, he's just like a friendly fat man who talks about video games and makes like decent jokes
01:40:16 I I remember seeing his avatar and thumbnails and I was like that this motherfucking piece of shit
01:40:22 I just didn't like his avatar. It's not a step. Yeah
01:40:25 Wait, who at last time the voicemails recommended that I watch someone and I actually did
01:40:31 Oh my god, it was it was I I know it was um
01:40:36 Oh god, who fucking was it? It was that guy with the purple mask
01:40:41 That guy with the purple mask I actually went and I watched one of his videos and it was like all right
01:40:47 Markiplier
01:40:49 No, he's like a nobody. He's got like 600 subs markiplier with this new luchadorie
01:40:55 Cosplay go be amigos
01:40:57 Viewers go back to last episode listen to whatever it was
01:41:01 Whoever it was that they recommended that I watch a channel of and I watched a video and he's got like
01:41:07 He's like a really loud
01:41:10 He's he's got the same accent as kim justice. It's a very it's not just a british accent. It's a very specific kind of
01:41:17 It's a very specific kind of british accent. Oh, and he like burst into laughter like
01:41:23 like
01:41:25 Sometimes like he'll end a sentence and just like start cackling
01:41:28 um, and uh, it's
01:41:30 kind of funny, I guess
01:41:33 I can't remember what his fucking name was I subbed in everything because it was like this is all right
01:41:37 Check the recent subscriptions if you can I'm looking I'm looking. I can't I can't find isn't there like a thing on the left side
01:41:44 I'm looking wait. No, I'm logged into the I'm logged into the wrong account
01:41:50 I'm logged into into uh
01:41:53 I was logged in I was logged in as the pcp. I was I should have been logged in as myself
01:41:58 I never watched uh, Noah
01:41:59 Cold World Javais until like yesterday and I watched like eight of his videos in a row and I was like, oh my god
01:42:04 There's another one. There's another really good video game guy. I love I love Noah. He's great. You should watch all of his stuff
01:42:10 his fucking
01:42:13 His fucking line reads are so bad. Oh, it's charming though. It's a little charming. I don't even mind it
01:42:21 I really don't
01:42:23 It yeah, they're just
01:42:25 It's it's funny because you you you you listen to him and he's like, oh he messed up that line
01:42:31 But you realize that it doesn't matter because it's it's a youtube video and you don't care
01:42:36 You've never cared and the only reason people have good audio is because they think they need it
01:42:40 What is this genre of youtuber called who'd like smart guys who talk about video games and don't waste your time with jokes like
01:42:46 We need like a name for these people
01:42:49 Yeah
01:42:53 Like
01:42:55 There's no glamour to it, which is what I really like
01:42:58 There's almost like no persona behind it at all. It's just here's here's lots of points
01:43:04 Well constructed and a good argument
01:43:06 Yeah, true. There's there's no ego to it. There's no, you know
01:43:11 It's good and they've all got really nice voices and ways of delivering their stuff, which is great
01:43:17 Which helps a lot. Have you seen I really like I really like his uh his travel logs
01:43:23 Where he just talks about I haven't seen any of those
01:43:26 He I think there's there's like
01:43:28 Two or three of them. There's like one where he like visits a bunch of
01:43:33 Places that are
01:43:35 I found it. Oh, there's one where he visits a bunch of places that are like inspired locations in the fallout games
01:43:41 And then there's like a couple more where he it's literally just like him describing like a road trip that he took
01:43:48 with his wife
01:43:51 Yeah, they're great. They're like three hours long. They're really relaxing
01:43:55 They're awesome. Um the channel I found it was called ray are reviewing
01:44:00 Ray are reviewing this guy with a purple mask. Oh, he has he has like the loudest
01:44:07 most british laugh
01:44:10 Uh, what I watched I watched his latest one about the the rise of youtube the rise of youtube video game critics
01:44:17 where he just talks about like
01:44:19 the the influence
01:44:21 of uh, you know dug walker and and no no mostly uh
01:44:25 Not nostalgia critic angry video game nerd and like the the diaspora of that, uh, you know, uh
01:44:34 He's I don't know. He's loud. It's really funny. It's it's really funny when he laughs
01:44:39 I don't know. I just think it's really funny when he's just like yelling something
01:44:43 And then just starts laughing at whatever he just
01:44:45 said
01:44:48 Yeah, I watched the the running shine video on yiek y2k earlier today
01:44:55 I I watched I love that video. I watched the to snaker
01:44:59 Uh yick video for like the second or third time again yesterday. That's enough those
01:45:06 What is it? What is it? I just
01:45:09 Those videos are so good. These two videos about yick. I'll have to check that one
01:45:15 Because I I was watching the only plays playthrough. They're playing through at the moment
01:45:19 It's like funny. What did you think of? Um, this the running shine?
01:45:25 Oh, very good video
01:45:27 Funny. It's such a good video. Uh, well argued
01:45:31 Correct entirely in every aspect
01:45:34 The to to snaker is not he's not as funny as running shine, but he has
01:45:40 To snaker has like a really interesting like thing where he he goes through the whole game and then at the end he has like
01:45:47 Two competing thesis about like what he thinks
01:45:51 The game is intended to mean and they're both like different from each other
01:45:54 And he and he lays out the case for like each one and why like he's not sure which which he believes
01:46:00 And uh, it's good. Yeah
01:46:03 To snaker, uh, what to snaker. Yeah, okay. Oh look into that
01:46:09 Um, I was on the train
01:46:14 Like a week or two ago. It was I think it was like
01:46:16 When I was on the way home from getting my shot or something or
01:46:20 I was on a train. I was on the subway
01:46:22 And I just like looked at my phone and I saw that running shine was streaming
01:46:29 And he that he was streaming with cybershell
01:46:32 And I was like, oh my god
01:46:34 I gotta get in there. So I just just saw my so just on just on my phone. I jumped into the chat
01:46:40 Just because I was like
01:46:42 I just want cybershell
01:46:43 To see me and I just I just want to say hi to cybershell and see if he'll say hi back
01:46:48 And I just jumped into the chat and made a some fucking stupid observation about how sonic the hedgehog has gone downhill as a franchise or whatever
01:46:57 some asinine nonsense
01:46:59 And uh cybershell noticed me and he was like, oh hi Ben and I was like, yes
01:47:03 Fuck that means running shine. That means running shine has has now noticed me as well
01:47:09 My influence
01:47:12 The notice spreads like a plague in the stream
01:47:16 Yeah, whenever you like stream like do a heckles for shackles and I'm like in the chat and you go, oh, hey, cybsie. I go. Yes. Yes
01:47:22 He knows what you're on
01:47:24 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that. I get that
01:47:27 But I was like it feels great. I've tried I've tried so many times to be like cool in a germa stream
01:47:35 But there's too many people. Oh, yeah, it's like it's impossible. You have to
01:47:39 I tried to be the one guy would be incredible
01:47:42 I tried to be funny
01:47:44 I tried to be funny in that chat
01:47:45 But I was like on the train and I had to get off in a minute
01:47:48 And I had like 30 seconds to look at the chat and I just like I tried to type a couple messages
01:47:53 But like autocorrect fucked one of them up and I was like dammit
01:47:57 Um, so whatever
01:48:01 Whatever I got what I came for
01:48:03 I got noticed. That's all that's all I wanted
01:48:07 Uh based based as hell
01:48:09 It's worked for me. I got on this fucking podcast by fucking bullying you on your twitch streams
01:48:15 You fucking we just commiserated. We just commiserated about
01:48:19 Being aggrieved about Trixie
01:48:24 Uh
01:48:25 Oh, it's just is that and the fact that uh, you have more twitter followers than me and that means that I I need to uh
01:48:31 I need to steal your cloud. It means you'll get a chubby little retweet from me. So
01:48:39 You scratched my back I scratched yours. If you know what I'm saying, that's the how you play the cloud game, baby
01:48:47 I mean, I like I like no simsie from from the art discords and stuff
01:48:52 And baby we use mummy milkers and it's like yeah simsie's a cool person. Thank you
01:48:57 You're you're both cool people uh, too. I've been a fan of you guys for a few years and I'm
01:49:03 Overjoyed
01:49:04 I get to talk but not but not from the pony days apparently. No, uh, I was I'm a lecture
01:49:09 Bastard I'm the worst kind of pc a pc p fan
01:49:12 Where I came in I came in with the big lectures
01:49:15 The worst child the worst now the worst kind are the are the old digi heads
01:49:20 Oh, I mean I I think I mean I was kind of that
01:49:24 And um, and I'm I'm not why did you come from the uh, the dick show lecture? No the the first thing I
01:49:31 Saw was your sonnet you think because I found out about you from the frederick nukeson video
01:49:36 Which I showed my friend and I was obsessed with it and I was like, I think that's one of fred's
01:49:39 I think that's one of fred's worst videos. Yeah, definitely. I would agree like he's improved so much since then but um,
01:49:45 Yeah, like I watched your sonnet you video. I was like, oh, this is cool. Hang on. There's a king hearts one
01:49:48 Hey, is that digi bro in the background and then
01:49:52 I'd listen to podcasts that went into all your solo stuff and watch lots of gipsy videos
01:49:59 It's not it's not my new it's not my new and and more sour grapes talking when I say that the like the hardcore digi heads
01:50:05 Are though are the worst are the worst faction of the pcp fan fan base? Uh, the lecture the lecture. I mean, that's fine
01:50:13 Uh, no, that's good. That's good. Um, I have gone back and listened to every episode
01:50:18 So I feel somewhat validated
01:50:20 But only the pony only the pony only those who were listening in the horse cast days are the true
01:50:26 The true core audience you can never if you weren't there, you don't understand man
01:50:32 You'll never really get it
01:50:34 Yeah, it really was like a secret
01:50:37 Society that like a lot of people just
01:50:39 You know because bronies were cringe at the time
01:50:42 It's like oh god
01:50:43 You were either in or you were out and if you were out you had no idea what they were doing
01:50:47 But you you just had a vague idea that they were strange if you were in
01:50:51 Uh, it's a it's a whole world
01:50:53 There was solidarity. There's brony solidarity
01:50:57 We all we all had each other's backs, you know, you've you mess with one of us. You mess with all of us spider-man. I mean goblin
01:51:05 Uh, yeah
01:51:06 It's like works though because there's there's so many people connected to your little community
01:51:10 Like like there's so many discord servers and offshoots of the pcp and like pcp adjacent things
01:51:16 They don't even know us anymore. There's like no
01:51:18 There's people there's people that like play rfck now that like don't even know
01:51:23 Yeah, I was I was on endless war the other day and like some like some guy was like, hey, are you doing?
01:51:28 Yeah, and he was like, do you want to go fishing? I was like, okay, and then he died and then he died
01:51:32 I was just waiting for him
01:51:34 He I was waiting for him at the pier
01:51:37 I was waiting for him at the pier and he was like, hang on. I'm all by over and then I fell asleep
01:51:41 Oh my god
01:51:42 So we had this weird little interaction. He was like, hey, uh, type go to jrp. I was like, okay, and I did it
01:51:48 And then he didn't even DM me. I said, I died lol
01:51:52 I was like, okay, cool
01:51:54 You know what?
01:51:55 Endless war is like a great like physical location online
01:51:58 Like if you wanted like set up a secret meeting with another person and then another internet person you go to endless war
01:52:05 You go to a specific street and meet you at this time
01:52:07 And it's yeah, you would you would never find it
01:52:10 Like it would be so hard to find like a record of what was said there
01:52:14 You would have to know like what what town what town in endless war
01:52:18 Do you need to navigate to and then like check the history and yeah to find those records?
01:52:24 So what i'm saying is if any if you want to do it, but endless war is funnier endless war is yes
01:52:29 DMs are first
01:52:30 If no, it was interesting because I wasn't even typing anything on the server. No wait actually
01:52:35 Oh
01:52:37 Yeah, this would be worse because uh
01:52:40 The other person would have a record of it if you both have a conversation in a place
01:52:43 Neither of you will be able to remember where the fuck it is or to scroll back to it
01:52:48 and then well
01:52:49 Yeah, you got to go and do your shady dealings in endless war and then get yourself banned from the server
01:52:55 You both got to get banned from the server so you can't find it again. It's the only way
01:53:00 I
01:53:02 True cyber security. That's the only way to make your nfts secure
01:53:07 I've been money laundering through endless war for years. I should just I should just I should just sell an nft of endless war
01:53:14 No, just of the game. No, no, no make make an nft of like a sly moid
01:53:20 No
01:53:22 I because I don't have to do anything like if I just sell I don't need to make like a model or like a picture
01:53:27 No, fuck it. Like just sell an nft of the game. It doesn't mean they own the game
01:53:32 It doesn't mean anything. It's just the nft represents the game and you own the nft
01:53:38 And uh, you know, I've burned down like 20 acres of forest to make this happen
01:53:45 I'm I'm gonna
01:53:46 What if what if it was an aft like an automatically fungible fungible token like no matter what you did
01:53:53 Someone else would have it you couldn't have the rights to it
01:53:56 It would be impossible to have the unique article. Isn't that just like a computer virus?
01:54:03 Yeah
01:54:06 I'll make I'll make a like a I don't know
01:54:10 The image of frisker as a aft and then she would infect the internet and she would be everywhere
01:54:17 Would you dances or something?
01:54:19 And she would eat bitcoin if she stays on your computer
01:54:23 It's just a little desktop friend that eats all your bitcoin
01:54:26 She she people are mining bitcoin and she would grief the miners. She would like poor lava on them
01:54:33 Dude bitcoin is down bitcoin is fucking dying
01:54:36 Bitcoin has been dying for a little while. Yeah. Oh, it's no it's it's down even more
01:54:42 It's down even more now like it like just today. It's having another like big crash today. It's down to 44. Holy shit
01:54:50 I don't know what I got. This is tinged. It's tinged for me though
01:54:53 It's who the who the fuck just left the call. It was craig
01:54:57 Craig you
01:54:59 It was a old friend craig. He's a fucking dog. Shit craig just fucking hates when we talk about bitcoin. You can't stand
01:55:06 Yeah, he's like he's like I don't want to hear this. He's like, no, I've got so much invested. I'm like
01:55:11 I don't want to hear this right now about it. Um, I'll have to get him back into record. I guess but uh,
01:55:18 I feel
01:55:19 Tinge of this because I want to celebrate when I see bitcoin go down because I sold
01:55:26 Uh near the top not quite at the top, but I sold like pretty high
01:55:30 You know, I made back like some of the money I lost on gme
01:55:34 So I was like pretty happy with that and now it's going down. I'm like, haha. Fuck it. Fuck you
01:55:39 um, but it's going down at least partially because elan musk said like
01:55:45 It's bad for the environment and like we're not going to trade in it until like it's less bad for the environment and I'm like
01:55:53 That's kind of a good reason for it to go down though. Damn it. Fuck
01:55:57 He took this. I can't I can't I can't be 100 happy about this anymore
01:56:01 I wanted to go down because it sucks
01:56:05 You want people to lose faith in it. You mean I wanted to go down because it sucks
01:56:09 Not because like someone is like doing like the right thing with it
01:56:13 You're just a very bitter man, aren't you?
01:56:16 Shut up
01:56:19 No, um
01:56:23 I I I I feel like it would be easier to feel happy that it is going down
01:56:28 It'd be nice setting a precedent
01:56:30 The that it might actually get green energy. It would feel better to be happy involved. No, I wanted to go down
01:56:37 because people see like oh
01:56:40 It's like it's stupid. It's stupid and it's and it's bad. Oh, bitcoin's bad. So
01:56:46 Let's not use it. Right. That's what I wanted. It is but instead it's like, oh, they're gonna. There's a problem with bitcoin
01:56:53 Okay, we need to address it and fix that problem so that we can re-adopt and I'm like, no
01:56:59 This like this is I don't want I don't what I don't want to see is like short-term
01:57:05 losses for bitcoin in the name of like, you know
01:57:09 Greenifying it or like, you know pretending to greenify or you know greenifying it enough that like people will stop complaining
01:57:15 Whatever only for that to like then become long-term gains. I don't want long-term games. I wanted to die
01:57:23 I feel like unfortunately it is too established to actually die
01:57:29 I mean
01:57:32 I mean, you never know
01:57:34 I mean, who knows? It'll go down. Obviously. It'll it'll have crashes, but it'll always be there as a thing
01:57:41 I'm too stupid. Maybe some of the less known coins
01:57:45 Will die out but bitcoin is
01:57:47 I mean, maybe maybe it'll like change hands. Which one is the most impressive? Bitcoin could be overtaken by a number
01:57:53 Another coin. Yeah, but I feel like that becomes more widely adopted
01:57:59 I think
01:58:00 I don't know. I don't think I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that crypto is just gonna be a thing that like people use in daily life
01:58:08 Why I don't think that I don't think that's inevitable
01:58:13 I think um that the uh
01:58:16 The trading investing and then buying low settling high all of that crap
01:58:20 That's short term in like interest
01:58:23 People will be like hype about making a quick easy money
01:58:27 uh, but eventually I think
01:58:30 it'll have to or
01:58:32 It'll have to become more usable in the real world for like just selling stuff
01:58:37 Well, yeah, that's buying stuff. But in order to do that it would need to like
01:58:43 Level out and not be as volatile
01:58:46 Yeah, so I'm like, I guess if if it can like if the investment hype
01:58:53 Can stick around long enough for it to mellow out and then I think it'll stay for I don't know
01:59:01 Well, it needs
01:59:02 It needs like wide adoption in the way that like everyone has access to getting it and like every and like
01:59:11 You know lots and lots of vendors, you know, accept it as payment and there's a convenient way of doing those transactions
01:59:18 And if that happens, I think then that will drive its value further up because now it will be more useful as a currency and therefore more valuable
01:59:25 So if one I think there's a lot of companies like investing into crypto
01:59:30 because of it's not being like
01:59:33 Regulated exactly. So there's there's an incentive for companies to get their hands on the sorts this sort of currency
01:59:40 Which I think is because it's like, um
01:59:45 Oh, I don't know much about finance, but I in my head I'm thinking like, oh, yeah offshore bank accounts like they don't have to pay tax
01:59:51 They're doing shady things all the time. Cryptocurrency is very easy to do shady things with that might be part of it, of course
01:59:56 They're gonna want it that might be part of it
01:59:59 um, I mean, I think it's also the idea that
02:00:03 It has not reached its peak value yet because
02:00:07 It has seen like some adoption lately, but it still hasn't seen like truly like universal adoption like if that
02:00:16 if it were to happen like tomorrow that like
02:00:18 Amazon accepts bitcoin and then like, you know mom and pop retailers all install a fucking scanner that lets you
02:00:26 You know pay for your fucking groceries in bitcoin
02:00:29 Then like it would fucking shoot up to 100k because that would like suddenly it's something that like everybody wants and it's not like
02:00:38 It's it's it's less niche now than it was before but it's it's still a niche thing
02:00:43 Um, yeah to to and to an extent
02:00:45 um
02:00:46 Yeah
02:00:47 So I think that's the like speculative part of it that like people are betting on
02:00:53 It eventually becoming more widely adopted which
02:00:56 Will make it more valuable which makes the value go up which makes getting in on the ground floor, you know
02:01:02 An investment that will pay dividends in the future
02:01:06 Uh, although it's the market seems to be looking a little bearish a little bearish for the moment, but uh, maybe just in the short term
02:01:14 Who knows
02:01:17 who fucking
02:01:19 knows
02:01:22 Yeah, no one you guys okay. Yeah
02:01:25 wowy
02:01:27 Man being being on the pcp is just save as listening to it. I zone out whenever benton. I was talking about
02:01:34 No, no zone out and starting muffins
02:01:38 It's time it's time to zone out even harder because I feel like we're at a point where maybe it's time to move on
02:01:43 To voicemails. Yeah
02:01:45 Yeah
02:01:46 By the way, ben we're at two hours right now. I don't want to be here for five hours
02:01:51 So no no smells go on for too long. I will kill my I
02:01:57 I'm still thinking I'm thinking we can
02:02:00 Hustle through these in an hour
02:02:03 We go quick. If we just don't react to them at all. We just play them in a string
02:02:07 I do try that's the strat. We go. I can try to keep it under three hours. I feel like that's a good
02:02:13 guideline
02:02:14 Yeah, let's see. Where do I where did I save this?
02:02:19 shit
02:02:23 Looking at speak pipe. Okay, the first voicemail
02:02:27 is from

02:03:03 Let me begin
02:03:05 Bleach is trash
02:03:07 Compare it to something like vagabond and tell me the characters have
02:03:11 Compare it to hunter hunter and tell me it has plot
02:03:15 It compare it to one piece and tell me it has world building
02:03:18 You're fucking delusional if you honestly believe bleach is good comparatively to any of those series
02:03:24 She got asked for a reason
02:03:26 Only series that big to be asked so far in
02:03:29 Literally never happened before or since but i'm sure you die hard idiots actually believe
02:03:35 When jump when they see you
02:03:37 I don't care. Uh, next one is called no anime analysis. No watch
02:03:44 Uploading it there
02:03:45 three two one go
02:03:48 I thought this was supposed to be digi bro's anime podcast. What the fuck aren't you talking about anime? Not anymore
02:03:55 baby, uh
02:03:57 Bro, we've cast off the yoke art
02:04:00 Bleach has good art in it. I like the drawings sometimes
02:04:05 This is no longer that uh, the anime podcast. Duh, thanks. Thanks for the
02:04:12 Cryptocurrency and trouble in israel
02:04:16 Yes, yes, yes, we're moving in a bold new direction. Uh, uh, uh, we don't know what our content is but we're gonna
02:04:24 We're gonna start color coding. Yeah, we got we're gonna have a blue and white border for israel palestinian
02:04:31 Conflict videos and we're gonna have yellow for bitcoin related videos
02:04:36 It's gonna be great. You're gonna love it. I have all the colors
02:04:41 For gib is dying corner
02:04:45 That's that's every video that's every video
02:04:50 Next next one is uh, no no next one is called motivation. There it is
02:04:56 three two one go
02:04:59 Hey pcb monotone jones here. No relation
02:05:02 I recently finished my first semester at uni and I'm pretty happy because now I have more free time to work on art and stuff
02:05:08 Nice. The issue is that I never have any motivation to do so. This is specifically withdrawing too
02:05:12 I never have any problem with making myself write my silly little books
02:05:16 I don't know if i'm adhd or what but I really do love making stuff
02:05:19 So there shouldn't be any reason that I can't force myself to work
02:05:22 You guys have some of the best worth work ethics i've ever seen and I don't know if it's because that's not true
02:05:28 Not if you could share some tips on how y'all stay motivated. I would appreciate it
02:05:32 Ben congrats on your game. I hope you feel better soon and tom. You'll never die
02:05:37 um, okay
02:05:42 Yeah, I mean if you if you love doing it then why can't you motivate yourself to do it would be my question like why
02:05:49 A lot of the time with um motivation like if you're thinking of something to do
02:05:54 uh
02:05:56 You might be thinking too big and that is like paralyzing you
02:06:00 A lot of the time you you end up like having a thing you do on the side just for fun and that becomes
02:06:05 Your main thing because you you're doing it more and the thing that you want to do
02:06:09 Uh that you keep thinking about doing and you're not doing it. It's because you're thinking too much about it
02:06:15 You just gotta yeah
02:06:18 Draw some stupid crap
02:06:21 It will suck
02:06:22 And then draw some more it sounds to me like he's just got art block and he just needs to wait
02:06:26 And keep trying until suddenly it goes. Oh, I can I can work again. Keep trying and wait. Yeah. Yeah
02:06:33 Keep trying and wait. That's the best way to put it try for like 20 20 minutes at most and then if it's uh,
02:06:38 Oh, oh, I can if it's not if it's not coming. Just yeah try again tomorrow. Yeah, exactly
02:06:44 Yeah, it happens that happens to me fucking on a monthly basis. We'll just be like an entire week where I'm
02:06:50 I'm my job. I'm not gonna do it
02:06:54 Just can't I mean you're you're quite quick with the the art and it's you are quality
02:07:00 So it's it's I think you can uh, you can afford yourself a few moments like that. Yeah
02:07:05 I mean
02:07:07 People just don't there's always an upper limit. There's always an upper limit to how unbelievably
02:07:12 Um, uh, productive a person can be and it's impossible to like be the most
02:07:18 You just do what you can. Yeah
02:07:21 Everyone works at a different rate and stuff
02:07:24 Uh
02:07:26 I I feel
02:07:28 I don't know. I sometimes I have the same thought as this guy like why can't I focus on the thing I want to do
02:07:33 I want to be working on this thing and yet I'm continually
02:07:37 Finding myself doing something else. Do I have a problem? Do I have ADHD? Should I get diagnosed?
02:07:43 I have that thought a lot. I think Ben. Well, I think it's it's it's like what you want
02:07:48 Is maybe the thing to be completed and the doing it is not the thing you want to do
02:07:53 Ben you're like I want to have the game be made. I don't want to make the game
02:07:57 Ben your show is called The Procrastinator's podcast. I know I think you forgot
02:08:03 It's a it's a big problem. It's a big problem. Uh, yeah, uh, I just I just uh, I don't know
02:08:11 Sometimes I wonder sometimes I wonder like am I
02:08:16 Am I operating and like am I am I am I operating irregularly?
02:08:21 Do I have like is there something like is there some issue?
02:08:25 Is the could be chemically resolved for me that would make me a more efficient at the things I want to do
02:08:30 Do you never think that am I crazy?
02:08:33 I mean if well, I guess I guess I do but I feel like if somebody says
02:08:39 Yes, you actually do have a ghc. Oh, yes, you do actually have autism
02:08:43 I I don't know what I would do. I guess I would just continue the way I was because well, no, I would
02:08:50 You're missing the point the point is if that happened and they were like, oh, yes
02:08:53 The reason why you don't uh work as efficiently as you wish you did is because you have ADHD
02:09:00 And we have you know, uh treatments. We have medication that is you know
02:09:05 Can treat some of the symptoms of ADHD and then what if I was like, oh, okay cool
02:09:09 And then I took some and then I found like oh wow
02:09:12 I'm way more able to focus on the things I want to do and I get a lot more done
02:09:15 I it's possible. I don't think I have
02:09:19 A medical issue though. I feel like I'm just most of the time. I don't have good discipline
02:09:25 I do but then every now and then I'm like discipline up when I was younger
02:09:28 But every now and then I'm like I'm procrastinating even though I really want to be
02:09:33 Getting that thing done and it's yes, it's it's clearly irrational. I'm clearly pursuing an irrational course of action. Why?
02:09:42 you know
02:09:43 I guess I guess that's human
02:09:46 I mean
02:09:47 It just comes down to like what are the things you could do playing video games or doing the other thing and that you
02:09:53 Choose the video games because you find more short-term pleasure in it and it's very easy to go to those sorts of things
02:09:59 Oh, I don't think it's indicative of you
02:10:01 It's just it's just how how things are so
02:10:05 Good and satisfying and video games. They give me that dopamine
02:10:09 So engaging
02:10:11 Yeah, I mean, it's true. I could be making money
02:10:16 Not really though
02:10:18 Not really because I don't get paid for anything in particular
02:10:22 Yeah
02:10:23 I just have I just have a vague sense of obligation that I need to be putting things out into
02:10:29 The world and I hope
02:10:32 That I will be correspondingly met with appreciation which in some cases might
02:10:39 congeal itself into money, but I have no guarantee
02:10:44 Uh
02:10:45 Just a kind of
02:10:47 Just a kind of vague sense that maybe sums up the artist experience
02:10:52 Yeah
02:10:53 Yeah
02:10:55 Uh next voicemail
02:10:57 is called uh
02:11:00 Gibbs pancreas

02:12:25 Capitalism
02:12:28 Uh, um scarcity, uh, I mean, I don't understand capitalism is probably
02:12:34 So I'm gonna let decay think bigger. Yeah, you know universal entropy universal entropy
02:12:40 Um
02:12:43 Biggest problem for the existence of the universe, but I don't care about it. I'll be dead
02:12:48 Well, when you when you when you can feel your toes touching each other in your shoes, that's the biggest problem in the universe
02:12:55 Um the biggest problem in the universe is just uh
02:13:01 Is just uh the the the finitude the finitude of of existence of of a discrete uh being
02:13:10 Just the the yawning the yawning gulf of void
02:13:14 Uh, uh that extends in every direction. I like that up down left right forward back and front and back and that inspires cool
02:13:23 Things that I see that I watch. Oh, I fucking hate you. I hate that shit. I hate that shit
02:13:28 Oh, you know, actually if you didn't have the abyss you wouldn't have dark souls more more talent
02:13:33 You wouldn't have dark souls if you didn't if you weren't all gonna die. We wouldn't have dark souls
02:13:38 That's yeah, the notorious best you'll see happened. You gotta fucking you gotta accept that then
02:13:43 Uh, it's mortality is good because it makes us sad and that makes us make video games to cope
02:13:50 like dark souls
02:13:52 Jesus fucking christ. I didn't say that I just said that like the the concept of thinking about the abyss
02:13:58 Gives you the thought to like, hey, what if I should put it out in a video game?
02:14:02 Yeah, I just
02:14:05 I
02:14:07 You sure now you're right. Yeah, it's true. I'd like to submit an argument
02:14:11 Uh, the biggest problem in the universe is when my uh drawing tablet pen disconnects
02:14:16 I have to move it a few centimeters away and then back again, and then it works again
02:14:19 That's the biggest problem in the universe. The biggest problem in the universe is when
02:14:24 Uh, sometimes my tablet does a thing where
02:14:28 For no, I I don't know why it will just
02:14:33 I'm not pressing any buttons, but I will I will hover my my mouse over
02:14:37 Like something and like over like a slider and the slider will just creep up
02:14:43 And like and like like a like the volume on a youtube video will just creep up to the max
02:14:48 Or like if I hover over like my my pens my pen tip size in like manga studio
02:14:54 The size will just creep up and I don't know why it's like my fucking mouse wheel is like
02:15:01 Nudged in a direction or something
02:15:03 And I have had times when I have had that for like weeks and I have like I've tried disconnecting my mouse and I've tried
02:15:10 Like fucking reinstalling my mouse drivers and stuff and like
02:15:13 I don't know. I think I think a broken mouse is the problem back then, but I got it again the other day
02:15:17 I was like, oh my god. This is gonna be a weeks long problem. I'm doomed
02:15:22 But no, I just like
02:15:23 Un I just unplugged my mouse dongle and re-plugged it in and fortunately that fixed again, but it was the scariest
02:15:30 I was so scared of having to deal with that because I really threw a wrench into a lot of fucking shit like
02:15:36 Fuck it. Let's destroy Israel
02:15:40 Yeah, yeah, you're right. Israel is the biggest problem in the universe
02:15:45 Israel, you know what? It's really it's a pretty big problem. No
02:15:50 America is the America is worse
02:15:53 If Israel is a problem, it's only because America is empowering them to do their shit
02:15:57 So I guess America is the big supposed to just all comes back to capitalism
02:16:01 Yeah, cool. Come on. You know what capitalism it all comes back to capitalism
02:16:05 Again, I was right the first time money
02:16:09 Money money dough

02:17:50 My arm was a little bit sore when I woke up this morning had some general flu symptoms
02:17:55 But took some tile at all. I'm feeling totally fine now. So yeah, don't worry ben
02:18:00 Some some people say it makes them feel pretty pretty out of it and sick for like a day or two
02:18:05 I
02:18:06 After I got my first one
02:18:08 uh, I was like literally nothing happened and then
02:18:12 Like five or six days later
02:18:15 Uh, I suddenly got like a little bruise like a like a bruising around the injection
02:18:21 And I'm like, why would that happen like five days later?
02:18:24 Uh
02:18:25 But like it's fine, uh
02:18:29 I'm pretty I don't know. I'm pretty hearty. I think I think I have like a pretty
02:18:35 Naturally like high constitution score and resistance to disease and illness
02:18:40 So I think I am probably not likely to feel much
02:18:45 From it
02:18:47 So thanks cross. I won't worry vaccine. Good
02:18:52 And if I do get a little sick, well, whatever it doesn't matter

02:19:50 He's got some staying power
02:19:52 he
02:19:53 You you don't think you think he's got to be out of material. How long can he keep this up?
02:19:58 He's can't possibly do it again. He's got a full week in between each one to come up with them
02:20:03 No

02:20:12 He's like work shopping it
02:20:14 What if I said something about feet? No, that's not funny
02:20:20 He's showing up to like open mic nights like reading like reading like a huge list of them out and just like

02:20:47 I watched a clip of
02:20:49 A bit of it. Did he did he say i'm a stupid. Did he say that? I don't think so
02:20:55 I I mean maybe I I literally
02:20:58 Just hearing about it and thinking about it. I saw I saw some people posting clips of the zoomer
02:21:05 What was it hospital? This is the gen z hospital and I
02:21:08 I I saw the thumbnail for the video and I I couldn't even click on it like I I was so embarrassed even
02:21:16 I was so embarrassed even thinking about like what could be in this video that like
02:21:20 I couldn't even bear to start watching it. So I just didn't and I watched a bit the mario
02:21:24 I saw that
02:21:25 And it was it was like cringe, you know, like they
02:21:30 They're just saying things that they've heard zoomers say but like not all of the things and mostly from twitch
02:21:35 They said poggers
02:21:37 um
02:21:38 Bass but it was like I didn't even know what that it was
02:21:42 like surprisingly
02:21:43 I mean it wasn't surprisingly bad. It was obviously bad like
02:21:48 I did it wasn't so bad that I was cringing out of my skin. It was just sort of like
02:21:54 You know

02:25:18 The guy with the glasses. Oh my god. I like had a dollar and I asked him to sign it. Um, and he was like weirdly
02:25:26 Offended and I could have been misreading his reaction, but
02:25:30 Weirdly, uh, it definitely seemed to me as though he was sort of taken aback by this
02:25:34 And I don't know like is that is it that weird? Um
02:25:37 I I don't think so. Um, but yeah, you defaced the the president. It's like a crime, isn't it?
02:25:44 No, who cares?
02:25:46 Yeah, I know who cares, but like it's a it's a piece of paper. I can see
02:25:50 I can see Doug walker being the kind of guy who would be worried about that sort of thing. You know what you're right
02:25:55 Yeah, I can see him being like, oh, you can't fucking write on united seats currency
02:26:00 I could totally see that maybe that's it. Yeah, or maybe or maybe it's like a
02:26:06 Or maybe it's like an ego thing where it's like this guy's seriously just taking some random junk and like asking me to fucking
02:26:12 Like give him my signature
02:26:14 No, I don't think it would be like that. I feel like I feel like the the him not wanting to
02:26:21 Like anger the american gods
02:26:25 Is is more likely really not I wonder say what you like about Doug walker. He's really not very mean spirited
02:26:30 A lot of the time. No, I don't ever see it. I don't think he's mean spirited
02:26:34 I don't think he's mean spirited, but I do think he's he's pretty conceded
02:26:38 I don't think he's pretty like self-absorbed and seems like kind of a narcissist. Oh, yeah
02:26:44 Yeah, I feel like I don't I'm a convention though. He
02:26:48 Do you think I'm do you think I'm reading him wrong that I think he would be like
02:26:51 He would be like do you gotta wait in line like everyone else for a signature?
02:26:55 I've only heard um good things about him in personal interactions
02:26:59 so
02:27:00 Like by actual people meeting him. I mean regardless of business practices and shitty videos
02:27:07 Yeah, yeah sure
02:27:09 Okay, I'm a huge fan of it
02:27:12 I was a huge fan of him. I don't want to think of him as being mean
02:27:17 Well, sure
02:27:20 Next voicemail is called thought slime. Okay, there it is three two one
02:27:28 Hey, it's me thought slime. Did you know that you're actually sexist and racist?
02:27:33 Uh
02:27:36 Let's know what he sounds like. That's not true. That's uh, that's uh
02:27:41 What that's not you you could say that you could make this
02:27:45 Impret you could do this impression of like anyone you could be like, hey, I'm I'm big Joel
02:27:50 Do you think did you know you're really sexist? Hey, I'm I'm fucking contra points. Did you know you're really sexist?
02:27:56 Like you could say this about fucking anybody terrible insane. Did you know that you don't have an RV?
02:28:04 Uh
02:28:05 Terrible this is awful. This is awful. Sometimes you just don't know what your unconscious biases are and you need them pointed out
02:28:13 You fuck
02:28:15 Sometimes that is true. Sometimes that is true. Give do you think me and ben are racist and sexist?
02:28:21 I definitely am
02:28:23 Uh, I don't know
02:28:26 Who knows it's it's it's everyone's a little bit like biased
02:28:31 Towards their own race just because they grow up around, you know
02:28:36 The same skin color and they're like, huh, what's that? It's someone different
02:28:39 I said I I always manifest in different ways, but like no not everyone is literally like the worst possible
02:28:46 Of anything I heard necessary. I heard a youtuber the other day
02:28:51 Who was a a black british person and I heard his voice and I said
02:28:57 This guy sounds like nino and someone was like it's kind of racist and I was like I thought about I was like, you know
02:29:04 It kind of is
02:29:07 It kind of is and then everybody
02:29:11 But like I mean, I don't know. I'm not I don't like feel bad
02:29:15 It's like, yeah, it is. I just think like like black people in
02:29:22 Well in the london area that have like a voice that white people in the london area do not have
02:29:27 So I could see why they would be like, oh, this is a similar sort of thing
02:29:32 Yeah, yeah
02:29:34 but but it's um
02:29:36 I mean, I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but I think you could probably yeah, it's kind of like a
02:29:42 racist
02:29:43 Thing to be like, oh these these these two people sound the same because they are the same
02:29:49 I don't know maybe I'm the accusation of racist as like
02:29:53 Oh, you're trying to ruin my life. You're a bad person throw me in jail. You're being malicious. You're a bad person in harry
02:29:58 You'll never be good at anything. Yeah. Um, and it's not always that yeah, I mean some people do act like that
02:30:04 And that's your you know what you're right racism is good actually
02:30:09 No, oh no, I've been don't clip that don't clip that
02:30:13 Don't clip out of context cut it out cut it out
02:30:15 All right

02:30:26 Next no double censor it censor everything
02:30:30 Next voicemail is called
02:30:33 Uh, wait a second. Hold on. You've pushed it too and we haven't listened to one of them
02:30:38 Oh, I'm stupid. Okay. Do the one that's called 3170. That one is Henlo Corgo

02:30:46 Hey
02:30:47 Ben
02:30:48 Yo, um, what up?
02:30:49 I was just wondering after spending roughly 10 minutes or so in your discord
02:30:56 How like often you hatefully masturbate to the dumb shit that Riley says
02:31:02 And how you compare the quality of those orgasms to normal orgasms
02:31:08 Because I myself have been interested
02:31:10 in
02:31:11 hateful masturbation for some time now
02:31:14 And I'm trying to like get into the craft and was wondering if you had any tips
02:31:19 I have been I have been seething particularly hard
02:31:23 Since the since the oaky interview. I mean, I've been doing it and I've got no investment in this shit
02:31:28 I have I have been thinking of
02:31:31 That guy says shit that really pisses me off. I hate him
02:31:35 I hate I hate her you Riley's you up. He does he really
02:31:41 I admit it. He I
02:31:44 I guess that's I guess that's a win. I guess that's a win for him. He's like a successfully
02:31:48 He makes me mad when he says dumb shit about like making fun of poor people and stuff. I'm like, he's a funny guy
02:31:54 Who isn't funny?
02:31:56 Sad. Yeah
02:31:58 Um, it's like yep. He's success successfully trolled me. I guess. Uh, it's it sucks and yeah, I've been yeah, I'm seething
02:32:05 So to answer your question, uh
02:32:07 I've been
02:32:09 Usually only once a week or so. Um, but this week multiple every day
02:32:17 Next voicemail is called roguelike recommendation three two one go
02:32:23 Hey, Ben. I have a roguelike recommendation for you since you cannot seem to be enjoying that genre a lot
02:32:29 So it's called synthetic
02:32:32 Subtitle is legion arising. I think
02:32:34 It's a top-down tactical shooter
02:32:37 Kind of a roguelike. It's pretty good. It has has like some really solid shooting mechanics
02:32:44 Um, I recently got its final update. So all of the content that will be in the game is in the game now
02:32:50 It's hard as fuck. So, uh, I think I beat it like four or five times and with the final update
02:32:57 They added kind of looks like a twin stick shooter, but I'm not sure not new game plus
02:33:00 But like a final ending after the ending that I got a couple times
02:33:05 Um
02:33:06 Yeah, it's pretty good. If you want to try it out for free. There's the arena version of synthetic
02:33:12 You can like try out just uh, just the mechanics against like hordes of enemies
02:33:17 But that's not the roguelike. Uh
02:33:20 Yeah, also that that's sef guy who made a video on kenji. He also made a video on this. So yeah, check it out. Oh, yeah
02:33:27 Seth Seth Seth seniche that guy
02:33:32 Seth like barlin. Uh, I'll check I'll check this out. I'm gonna check this out. I like video games
02:33:38 Ben when you're gonna play hades
02:33:41 Oh
02:33:44 Hades nuts. I don't think I don't think you would like hades that much, but I really like it
02:33:49 uh, honestly
02:33:51 Yeah, I think
02:33:52 I just heard I started so many people gushing about it, but
02:33:55 Yeah, I mean I talked about this last the isometric gameplay. It doesn't look like
02:34:00 It doesn't look like you're blown away, but I don't know. I'm sure it's fun. I'm sure it's fine. It's very addictive
02:34:05 Um, the character is nice. Music's really good. I really should give it a I really should give it a try
02:34:09 It's just very satisfying to play. It's one of those that's you just sit and
02:34:12 Chill and runs are only like 20 minutes. So it's nice to jump in. That's good
02:34:17 A noida run a successful run is like 16 fucking hours. So
02:34:22 I've never made it past the hasty base in noida. I suck
02:34:26 Oh
02:34:28 You fucking idiot
02:34:30 Fucking dumbass
02:34:33 Here's what you do. Yeah, fuck you. No, here's what you do. No, no, no
02:34:36 You just you all all you gotta do is you go to the mines and you go to the left
02:34:41 And you just you just dip into the you dip into the fungal caverns
02:34:45 Because that's where the good wands are you dip into the fungal caverns and you get a good wand
02:34:49 You look for you look for a high mana regen
02:34:53 Uh, uh, and and you know low low reload time and cast
02:34:58 Castile and reload time
02:35:00 And if you can find all what you gotta do you need you need a mana you need the mana
02:35:06 Rebooster or fuck. What's it called? Um
02:35:09 The the the mana the one that like gives you 30 extra mana. I got your coach. I'm writing this down coach
02:35:14 We're writing it all down if you get that if you get that you're fucking done if you get that it's game over
02:35:19 You just fucking you just stack that you just stack that in the right wand and you just
02:35:24 And that's it. You got a fucking chainsaw wand and of course
02:35:27 And of course I get that all the time because I know what to look for and I still fucking die in the heesey base
02:35:31 because I fucking because I shoot bullets into a
02:35:35 Liquid nitrogen canister that I didn't see under a pile of snow
02:35:38 But if I was being smart and playing more patiently I would never die
02:35:43 Uh, so that's how you do it. Cool. Yeah. Now you know not it is a good game. I just I've barely scratched the surface with it though
02:35:52 So it's so fucking good dog
02:35:55 You got you you haven't been to a pair if you haven't been to a parallel worlds
02:35:59 Forget about it. Okay. Um
02:36:01 Yeah, I haven't
02:36:04 Next next one is called, uh clarity
02:36:08 three two one go
02:36:11 I benched on to clarify a couple things. I wasn't entirely with you about autism last week
02:36:17 I wasn't correcting you on anything. You just sounded kind of unsure the first time you talked about it
02:36:24 So I thought hey, I'm autistic. I'm diagnosed and everything so maybe I can give them some first-hand insights into what it's like
02:36:31 I guess I couldn't uh
02:36:33 Maybe it's fine that it's an increments of a minute and a half at something
02:36:37 Your voice this okay, that's it. Thank you. Nope. Thanks for the voicemail. Uh, sorry your other voicemail wasn't great
02:36:44 Uh, keep them shorter. Thank you. Uh, next one is called
02:36:49 Dolos
02:36:51 Uh, there it is three two one go
02:36:56 So, um, like um, this um question. Um, is maybe um, uh,
02:37:00 Directed uh, um at uh Tommy, but the rest of y'all can answer too. No
02:37:05 Especially because you know, he's not here your roster changes every five seconds on the podcast
02:37:11 Sorry guy. Don't know if he'll even be here. Nope
02:37:15 Uh, Ben said to keep these short. So, you know, uh, how are the kids?
02:37:19 Okay, how's the life?
02:37:22 Uh thoughts on the guilty gear beta though
02:37:25 Cheers. I'm sorry
02:37:27 I've been seeing a lot of guilty gear posts on twitter. I post about yesterday
02:37:32 But I I don't know what to think about them because I don't play. Yeah, I don't play that shit
02:37:36 I think the the girl with the wolf is hot
02:37:39 Um, is she is she now? Yeah, she's like the new character
02:37:42 She's just like a girl in like a like business casual attire and she's got like a cool wolf that she summons. She's nice
02:37:49 Cool. She's the most normal looking guilty character
02:37:53 To me guilty gear is a guilty ignore
02:37:56 Hey, it looks like something cool. I just I just keep ignoring it. I just can't play fighting games
02:38:02 I just can't do it. I can't even play the dragon ball. Yeah, also
02:38:06 Hmm, are you just following for the
02:38:10 Cute girls. Yeah
02:38:12 Just look at the art of the characters and go. Yeah, that's cool. I'm just waiting for the game to come out
02:38:15 So I can watch all the animations on youtube basically. That's fair. All right, that makes sense. They do they do look great
02:38:21 That game looks fucking great. Yeah
02:38:24 Uh, sorry tom wasn't here to answer your question law
02:38:28 um
02:38:30 The next voicemail is called. Where is it here? I?
02:38:33 Oh god, I found it. It is called. Uh
02:38:36 SF2 is base not that one
02:38:39 three two one go
02:38:42 Saka frontier 2 it says obscure ass square soft rpg for the ps1
02:38:47 And it's got these kooky characters brights, but the most gorgeous
02:38:51 Watercolor backgrounds the soundtrack is amazing. It's like the pinnacle of how to speak motif in music
02:38:58 The combat system is pretty fucking wonky
02:39:01 But once you really experiment or research into it, it's really sick
02:39:06 The only blight on the game is that it has these hideous
02:39:10 3d backgrounds when you get into battle
02:39:13 And they are just dot awful
02:39:15 So truly, uh, tom is wrong for once
02:39:20 2d over 3d. Thank you. Thank you very much
02:39:23 Check out this game. If you really like old s rbgs. It is really fucking saga frontier
02:39:31 Oh, I thought he said soccer frontier
02:39:37 I would type that in and I just got soccer
02:39:40 Saga I'm looking at screenshots
02:39:43 Saga
02:39:44 Oh god, I guess they did like a fucking it looks like they did like a hideous chibi remaster of it
02:39:50 Oh, that's what this is
02:39:53 Like one of those fucking uh, like final fantasy the old final fantasy like phone remakes. Yeah, like a psp remake of it
02:40:01 Yeah, oh, yeah, that looks like like it's 2000s mmo
02:40:05 So I I can't tell what's the original game here and what's like some shitty remake
02:40:10 I just don't know was it too. They was talking about
02:40:14 It's I it's a 2d game, but I think it has 3d
02:40:18 backgrounds only which is like a weird
02:40:21 Design choice. This looks really nice. Honestly. I might watch it. Let's do it
02:40:27 Um, I
02:40:31 I don't know some of these
02:40:35 I want to
02:40:37 I don't I don't think I like the look of it very much. There are bits that look okay
02:40:42 Uh, I would have to see it in motion. The one on steam is definitely like a shitty remake of the first one
02:40:48 Yeah, it looks really bad. Yeah
02:40:51 Okay, next one, uh, there you go. It is called. What is it?
02:40:59 Based veggie tails three two one go
02:41:03 Oh
02:41:05 Have I ever told you about the israelite? I know this one. Hmm the israelite
02:41:11 Oh, yeah, I remember those guys weren't they supposed to be god's chosen people? That's what the bible says
02:41:19 Oh, I bet they always followed god's directions. Oh, you'd think so, wouldn't you?
02:41:26 Yeah
02:41:30 You would think so
02:41:33 Jelly beaner posted that in the rad con
02:41:39 In the rad con server and I I really cracked me up
02:41:45 Oh, oh, you'd think so
02:41:47 Is veggie tails a christian show right? Yes. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yeah, okay. You've never seen it
02:41:54 I've seen the one where they predicted memes and people like oh, wow, I see the one where they all turned to look at each other
02:42:04 Wait, were they predicted? I saw the one where there was an orange and he yelled. What do you mean? Were they teeth?
02:42:10 What do you mean where they predicted memes?
02:42:13 Uh, it's that clip that keeps going around where they say in the future comedy will be randomly generated and
02:42:20 They have like a like a shit post spot
02:42:23 Wait veggie tails has that
02:42:26 Yeah, it was a clip
02:42:29 Uh, I okay, that's
02:42:31 It's strange. I'll have to look that up later. It's really weird. Okay
02:42:37 Um, why would why would they have that? What? I don't understand. I I no idea. I've never watched it
02:42:45 Next voicemail is called ben read one piece, please three two one go
02:42:52 So I was just watching munchies video he put out
02:42:56 And I just wanted to say that he is a good boy. Yeah, and
02:43:00 I am proud of him even though
02:43:05 He didn't need to do any of this and it really shows
02:43:09 Massive growth on his part to do all that stuff. Um
02:43:14 um
02:43:15 Munchie a good boy
02:43:17 um, I
02:43:19 I think
02:43:21 I think he went
02:43:23 I mean, I would say he went a little overboard. He used some flowery language like and
02:43:29 Said some things that like, you know, I think he's
02:43:34 I think he's correct in what he was doing
02:43:36 But I think definitely what he isn't saying is that he doesn't like the limelight either
02:43:41 So like I just want to not be here anymore
02:43:44 And also things I've said were bad if if he yeah
02:43:47 If he just doesn't want to be online anymore that I mean, I guess fair enough
02:43:51 I don't think it was really necessary to delete
02:43:55 Everything that he deleted and I I think it's a little cringe to delete stuff for no reason and some of that stuff
02:44:02 I feel like was fine
02:44:04 But at the end of the day, it's it's his stuff and he can do what he wants with it
02:44:08 Uh
02:44:10 Yeah
02:44:11 Good good good for him. I saw I saw a few people criticizing him on the podium discord where they were saying like
02:44:17 Oh, it's clear that he's lying about uh, not doing this just because uh,
02:44:22 It all affects his job prospects in the future. I was like, oh, okay. That's none of your fucking business. Who cares?
02:44:28 I uh
02:44:32 I mean
02:44:33 Even if that were true, would that not be a great? Yeah, that that would be a great reason. Yeah, exactly. That would be
02:44:41 That's really weird
02:44:43 Like like that
02:44:46 If you're like, hey, I want to get a maybe fucking get a job in an industry one day
02:44:50 And like if I have videos of me saying the n-word then I won't be able to get it then like

02:46:55 Signed my dollar like he was he was there to sign things. Okay. Well. Yeah in in that case
02:47:01 It can only be that he had a problem with the dollar
02:47:05 So he must have just been like he didn't want to sign a dollar. Yeah, I can't sign at the holler. That's the greatest in the law
02:47:12 Isn't that illegal and legal tender though? Yeah, that's totally what he needs to use that

02:47:38 Okay, they added a few new characters and doubled the characters because they all have alternate versions now
02:47:44 As well as tons of new content alternate routes new endings all that shebang
02:47:50 Also, please catch up on one piece. Thanks. Yeah, man
02:47:54 I'll probably check out Isaac again. Hey, Ben. Where where where were you last when you were reading one piece?
02:48:01 I was uh
02:48:02 kind of
02:48:04 Early on in wano like I was a little ways into wano. Okay
02:48:09 I would say wait until you hear that wano's over because it's
02:48:13 We're in the yeah, we're in the thick of it now and captain. It's a little bit like oh fuck reading it
02:48:19 Oh, like like if I caught up now, I would be on a cliffhanger. No, you'd I don't reckon you'd enjoy the week before that
02:48:27 you'd be in
02:48:29 In no, I don't I don't want there's a lot of action happening and not a lot of plot furthering
02:48:34 It is a lot of panels of cool shit happening. But there's only so many
02:48:40 Only so many things you can show in that many pages
02:48:42 We're deep in what is known as clash piece at the moment where it's just every chapter is just the different clash between characters
02:48:48 I mean, I'm I'm really enjoying it. It's cool. But I am if you want to binge it. Maybe after it's finished
02:48:54 Yeah, yeah
02:48:56 Yes, I do want to binge it. I'm not interested in getting back into reading weekly. There's some great stuff in wano. So yeah
02:49:05 Uh, oh, it's incredible
02:49:08 Hmm
02:49:14 I do I wish I was caught up, but I don't want to spend the fucking time
02:49:17 Ben it's got actual trans characters who are actually cool and do things. Isn't that nice? Um
02:49:23 It already had it already had those had the okama. Yeah, but now it's got like a pretty girl one
02:49:31 Well, that's nice. It's it's still I love I love that for her that character is
02:49:37 Trans or is just a man that looks like a she refers to herself as she she gets everyone else to refer to as yeah
02:49:43 I've always seen her in all in all the ways that that matter. It's yeah. It's a trans character. Talk about kiku not Yamato
02:49:51 I don't know who these people are. Yeah, don't worry. They're lame. They're okay
02:49:57 Uh next
02:50:00 Wait
02:50:02 Wait, what?
02:50:03 That was the bend to do oh wait, I uploaded to okay the next one is 3 180
02:50:07 Okay, uh, the this one is why the Ralph thing makes no sense three two one go
02:50:15 The the Ralph video was not uploaded like to start a fight and to get clout
02:50:19 The Ralph video was uploaded out of spite because it's motivated by fucking Trixie not by uh by fox's face
02:50:26 Vizier dickhead, uh, it's motivated by Trixie because it's spite at uh fucking may and Ralph
02:50:32 That's why that video went up. It has nothing to do with fucking money at all. That's just like why can't it be both?
02:50:37 A neat side effect that was completely like a missed opportunity for them to fucking get clout with it
02:50:42 But no that I don't I don't I don't these are all good relationships fight bullshit
02:50:47 That's why it went up on the fucking channel to the fucking piss me off. That's the only reason why I I don't think you're right
02:50:54 I think that might be a reason. I think it's absolutely both
02:50:57 I
02:50:58 Yeah, I think it's both and probably hundreds of all reasons of insanity that we we can't comprehend
02:51:05 Probably yeah, yeah
02:51:07 Sorry sucker, but you're
02:51:09 You fuck you
02:51:11 Sorry, you're a fucker. I rhymed it. Sorry. We've decided that you're wrong with no evidence
02:51:15 clarification
02:51:17 We we know what those guys were thinking. You don't know shit
02:51:23 Oh shit, I posted another one whatever next one is a three one eight one. It is uh the deepest lore
02:51:30 Three two one go
02:51:33 I want to hear the fucking Tobuscus deep lore somebody should figure that shit out because like quentin reviews already did
02:51:39 I don't fucking know who that guy is. He would brag about it on like his channel. Sometimes I don't know anything about
02:51:45 Players and shit like that. So there has to be this some like that guy with the glasses pro jared game
02:51:52 Yes, like style. Yes, like deep lore quentin reviews story about this person
02:51:57 And I've never heard it told from a like reputable source before so it's got to be out there somewhere
02:52:02 Yes, someone figure it out. It'll be funny
02:52:07 If you had type if you had typed that into fucking youtube I think you would have come up if you typed Tobuscus drama
02:52:14 If you took Tobuscus drama or history or something like that, then fucking you'd have it
02:52:18 There's probably more. Yeah, there's probably plenty more videos that I haven't seen. I've just seen the the quentin
02:52:23 I know who I made a funny scorum song whatever and he was a sex pervert
02:52:29 I had only I had only heard the name
02:52:32 I had never heard I isn't tabuscus is the diamond sword sword sword sword is that that guy?
02:52:37 I know that from munchie knowing that song. I had never heard the chicken in a biscuit song
02:52:44 Before I found out
02:52:47 I watched that quentin video and I was like, okay
