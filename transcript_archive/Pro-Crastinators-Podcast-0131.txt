00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, your favorite
00:00:27 and most lucrative friendship simulator. I am the best guy ever and today we're joined
00:00:33 by Lethal Roarumage. Hello. How deadly of you. And Tom Oliver. I am here, I am, games
00:00:44 are pumping through my blood and my veins and my brain and my synapses are firing up,
00:00:50 up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A select start. Let's do this. Why is it
00:00:55 never just hello with you people? Why can't you just say hello? Because you got, you have,
00:01:00 you have the domination, the sole proprietor license to use hello. The rest of us have
00:01:07 to come up with something clever every time because you, I think there's a, I feel a spirit
00:01:13 of one upsmanship that I want to be the best and to trounce everyone else with my magic
00:01:18 comedy skills. I don't usually succeed or anywhere close to it. Right, right, no, no,
00:01:24 me neither. It's, it's, Mages just takes the, the safe effective route every time it works
00:01:30 and she keeps going with it and we just keep botching it, trying to be entertaining clowns.
00:01:34 I gotta queue up that sound bite. She's such a normie. No, no, no. One day I'll have that
00:01:41 sound board actually working. I should take Bitterthorn's advice and get that stuff set
00:01:45 up. Yeah. How have we gone 131 episodes and not have a sound board? It just seems some
00:01:51 people don't like the idea of a sound board. I don't like the sound of some people like those
00:01:56 people and the words they're making about sound boards. Did you just hear that noise? No, I did
00:02:03 not. Why? What was it? It was my alarm for the podcast. It was supposed to be an hour before
00:02:11 or like half an hour before, but I'm guessing, I'm guessing the time. No, no, no, no, I'm guessing,
00:02:16 I'm guessing what happened is Daylight Savings. Oh, did that, why is it Daylight Savings like
00:02:23 switches like every fucking week of the year is what it feels like? Can we talk about time zones
00:02:29 and how they're bullshit and how people know? I don't get it. I don't understand. Just watch that
00:02:34 video. How is this so complicated? There's a great video by, what was it? Some fuck who was it?
00:02:40 It's like, it's like, why time zones suck or something about like, why making a clock sucks
00:02:45 or something like that. Why making a clock sucks. I was, it was, it was, it was something about why
00:02:50 programming like a digital like timekeeper is like such a pain because the rules of time zones
00:02:56 are so crazy. It is. And actually, I remember like, I think that like the most, so there, first of all,
00:03:01 like there's, there's just straight up time zones, then there's Daylight Savings time, which does not
00:03:05 stay like consistent between places. Then there's like, like London has its own kind of system where
00:03:10 it like switches actual time zones or something. Then there's, and I think the worst example of all
00:03:16 was like, I think it's, it's actually the Gaza Strip. Actually between Palestine and Israel,
00:03:21 I think they actually are in different time zones. And it's like, now you have to get political with
00:03:27 what time you decided is in like this region of the world. And it's like, well, shit, man, I didn't
00:03:32 sign up for this. It's interesting. Whatever video that is, it's great. Like, I remember, like, I
00:03:37 remember even like weirder is that like back in the day, I was big into conspiracy theory videos,
00:03:42 and I watched them all the time. And I watched this one conspiracy documentary called Chimatica.
00:03:47 And in it, there was this guy who was talking about how clocks and time itself is a conspiracy
00:03:52 about how like, what way I don't remember exactly has been forever, but I just remember him,
00:03:58 like, he's like, we're all slaves to the watch. And that time is an unnatural way of like humans
00:04:03 to like track things. And like, it was developed specifically to keep us like tethered to like
00:04:09 a false reality. And that like humans are supposed to be more organic in their experiences. And we're
00:04:15 all like fucking ourselves over and like getting loose in touch with our chakras by being a slave
00:04:21 to the watch. The thing about that is the thing about that is there is a nugget of logic to that.
00:04:26 They're like, there is a core that sort of makes sense. Because it's true, the 24 hour day cycle
00:04:31 that we all do everything to it is reasonably artificial. But it's like, we've got to organize
00:04:36 society some way. And this seems like a pretty reasonable way to do it. Apparently not if you
00:04:42 want to keep those chakras blitzed. That's what I learned from that. That was also that was also
00:04:47 the documentary that talked about Admiralty Merit or maritime admiralty law. That was some
00:04:52 fucked up. Do you ever hear about that that conspiracy? Okay, as conspiracy know, what's
00:04:57 the deal? Okay, so the idea between maritime admiralty law is that everybody technically has
00:05:03 two names. You have you have your personal name, then you have your corporation name. And they're
00:05:08 the exact same thing, except your corporation name is all in capital letters. And like, like on your
00:05:14 birth certificate and stuff, it's in all capital letters. And the theory behind this is that every
00:05:20 the reason you need a birth certificate in the first place is because every human being who's
00:05:23 ever been born is technically not just a human, but also a piece of collateral that the government
00:05:29 takes out against its loans. And so whenever they're referring to you in all capital letters,
00:05:35 they're referring to the technical corporation of your personhood. So I guess the corporation is
00:05:41 people after all, exactly. But like the thing is, is that like, these people also believe that if you
00:05:46 go into court, when you're summoned to court, they're summoning you the corporation and not
00:05:50 you the human being so you can just not go or just show up and be like, I'm not the person,
00:05:55 like you're trying to talk to the corporation and they're not here is just me the person and I'm
00:05:59 going to ignore these things that's like, like jury nullification that like, you're not supposed
00:06:04 to know about it. But I think I think that's the idea. But I think it's also bullshit, you know,
00:06:09 it doesn't sound like that's going to hold up. No, no, no, no, when the cops come, I say,
00:06:14 no, no, no, no, no, I just didn't show up to my, you know, murder court appearance because
00:06:18 I'm the person you're looking for the corporation exact Nate best man that that guy's elsewhere.
00:06:23 Yeah, okay. That guy's based out of like, I don't know, Dublin or something. If you want to have
00:06:27 some good sillies, go go search climatic. It's like a 2009 documentary. And it's it's some crazy
00:06:33 shit, dude. You know, this just reminds me of I think I've said it before, but there's it's a
00:06:37 if it's a separate thing, but it just reminds me of like, in Japan, there's a law that's
00:06:42 effectively like you're not allowed to drive like something about like in rain, you're not allowed
00:06:48 to drive too close to the edge of the road or something. And but like the wording of the law
00:06:53 is something that is like, drive not near the edge of death in the rain for there the skid demon
00:07:01 lies. Oh, God, imagine how much cooler history class would be if our laws were written like that.
00:07:10 Holy shit. It was something like that, at least. Yeah, look it up. It's one of the it was in like
00:07:14 one of those like, like sounds fake, but is real laws that's like of antiquity or something.
00:07:20 The best shit. The best pretty good stuff. Hey, guys, I want to yeah, I just want to close the saga.
00:07:27 I bought candy corn. Oh, have you eaten it? Yes. Yes, I have. What's the conclusion?
00:07:36 It's okay. It's like, it's quite different from what I expected it to be. But it's not as bad as a
00:07:45 lot of people made it out to be. To those who are listening, it sort of reminds me of the candy
00:07:52 called irises in the opinion. It's not exactly the same. At least the ones I bought, they have a
00:07:59 very strong honey taste to it. Honey taste, okay. Yeah, so it might be because of that.
00:08:06 Made, you know, you have to do now, you have to get the companion candy to the candy corn,
00:08:11 which is the candy pumpkins. They always come together. So now you're going to go on another
00:08:15 epic quest to get the candy pumpkins. Yeah, which tastes more ubiquitous. It is more ubiquitous,
00:08:20 but those are everywhere. They taste almost exactly the same. So it'll be a probably made of the same
00:08:25 material. A largely useless quest, but I'm sending you on it anyway. I have the option to refuse.
00:08:33 You could, but you'll disappoint me. I appreciate the seasonal timeliness of this whole quest,
00:08:39 which I guess is why it came up, because it's a Halloween candy thing. Yeah. But it gets me in
00:08:43 the spirit. Although this episode will be airing after Halloween. So hope you're enjoying your
00:08:48 post-Halloween lull, everybody. Yeah, go to your candy bin and grab some candy corn.
00:08:54 Everyone's on that Christmas hype now, Christmas. Oh, you're right. I forgot after Halloween,
00:08:59 it's Christmas season has begun, basically. You know what the best Christmas present is?
00:09:05 Donating $5 or more to the procrastinators on Patreon, we have a new bonus episode out
00:09:12 and edited by Mage. Oh, that's right. Over all, people. A hot coals of After Effects rendering,
00:09:22 taking their CPU to a hot sizzle. There's a lot of work there. Go do it. I didn't use,
00:09:28 in the end, I didn't end up using After Effects because it was just not agreeing. Yeah, it's just
00:09:33 me and Bentley. So were you able to get the animation stuff working?
00:09:37 Some of it, but not the mouth flaps, sadly. It was just too much trouble. I'm sorry,
00:09:43 I'm sorry. There's no mouth flaps. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. That's cool.
00:09:50 I was going to say, speaking of skid demons with that law, I have a thing to bring up relevant
00:09:57 to that exact thing. I think I was visited by a skid demon actually multiple times.
00:10:03 And this is about my skateboarding exploits on my wife's skateboard, effectively.
00:10:10 People were roasting me in my stream yesterday about that. Anyway, yeah, so I've been out
00:10:18 e-skateboarding and it's pretty great doing Pokemon Go and loving it. But there's been two
00:10:23 times now that I've wiped out hardcore and it's been pretty brutal. The first time was definitely
00:10:30 the work of a skid demon. I was going up this hill I've gone up many times before, this little
00:10:35 ramp into this big parking lot that I love to just go nuts and go max speed. And on the way up,
00:10:41 there's always these grass clippings across the blacktop leading in. And on this particular day
00:10:46 it was pretty wet outside. It had rained and I go up and I just wipe the fuck out and I scraped my
00:10:54 elbow. My right elbow got a little fucked up. That wasn't that bad. That was okay. I got up
00:10:59 and I hobble away and I'm okay. But then there was a couple days ago, like three days ago,
00:11:04 when I'm just skateboarding on the sidewalk and I'm coming up and there's a group of kids in
00:11:09 front of me and I'm like, actually, I had passed these kids, I had passed these kids on my way down
00:11:15 and they were like, whoa, dude, that's so cool. And I was like, yeah, nothing personal kid as I
00:11:21 max speed away from them. And I look totally sick and cool. And then as I'm coming up, actually
00:11:27 they ran alongside me like trying to keep up. But I just room I just knew where they say
00:11:34 they're like, I don't know, like maybe late elementary school to early middle school kids.
00:11:38 So like 12 or so probably 12. Yeah. So that was cool. And and then on the way back,
00:11:46 I see the same group of kids and I'm like, well, they're kind of taking up the sidewalk. I don't
00:11:50 want to cut through them. So what I do is I just skate off the edge of the
00:11:57 sidewalk onto the street as I'm coming towards my place. And so normally this can be a fine thing
00:12:04 to do. But there's lots of times when the difference between the sidewalk and the road is can be like
00:12:10 over two inches. And this is one of those times. And if you if you if you're if you're going straight
00:12:15 and then you just kind of veer to the right a little bit, you get like one wheel basically off
00:12:20 the thing. And you I mean, the imbalance going at fairly high speed is just quite high. So
00:12:26 I did this literally just to look cool to these kids that were thinking I was I was dope, because
00:12:32 I could have just stopped and gotten off. But no, no, no, no, you got to do in one motion. As I do
00:12:36 this, the whole thing buckles, it goes like a 45 degree angle. And I just go flying into the middle
00:12:41 of the road. Just just fucking up my body bad in I mean, I scraped my hand terribly. I have many
00:12:49 wounds on it. Did you not wear gloves? I was not wearing gloves. I told you to wear gloves. You
00:12:56 did specifically suggest wearing gloves. And that would have been a very good idea. I was wearing a
00:13:01 long sleeve shirt and jeans. Thank God, because I tore up my jeans, still got multiple wounds.
00:13:07 And my elbows got a little fucked up too. But the worst by far was my hand that was not covered
00:13:12 in any clothes. And so I got a big gash. I've got a picture. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's not
00:13:20 of the wound. It's of my bandages. That's all it is. So there's nothing graphic there, just to give
00:13:24 people an idea of is it like my favorite animes were just wrapped up in gauze. That is what I
00:13:31 used actually. I did use gauze. Of course, of course. The shonen healing device. 100% effective
00:13:39 every time. And it's pretty cool. So you can see that in the links below people. And I just uploaded
00:13:45 it. So yeah, pretty fucked up, hurt a lot, still hurts. Definitely looks like an anime.
00:13:50 So basically what I was going to say is I think this is there was one time I was playing on the
00:13:54 black top as a kid where I got pushed. I was playing four squares something and I fell back
00:13:59 and hit my head and like blacked out for a second, which technically counts as a concussion.
00:14:04 But the thing is, that was probably the worst I've ever been hurt in my life, which is to say I really
00:14:09 haven't been hurt a lot. I've never broken a bone. Like this scrape like stands out as one of the worst
00:14:14 things I've ever done. And it really wasn't that bad. Just kind of, you know, got a couple of cuts
00:14:19 and stuff. And so I was just wondering if you guys have had like worse injuries than this.
00:14:25 Like have you ever, I know Tom has had some issues where his like heart literally stopped
00:14:29 for a bit. I don't know if that's an injury per se. My body is even more suicidal than I am.
00:14:36 Have you guys ever like broken a bone while like shredding hardcore or anything like that?
00:14:41 I haven't had any broken bones, but I recall three instances where the injury was pretty
00:14:47 not fun. What happened? Okay, so the earliest I remember was back in the Violet Violins days.
00:14:56 Indeed. Yes. As one would expect. Yeah, we were in a place where we weren't supposed to be and there
00:15:03 was a lot of lumber and the lumber had a lot of nails. Rival gang territory. No, no, it was in our
00:15:09 territory. And there were like a lot of lumber, a lot of nails and I stepped on one and it went
00:15:14 straight through my foot. Oh, went through your foot. Ah, yeah. Oh Christ. Okay. I didn't even
00:15:21 realize what was happening until I couldn't lift my foot. Okay, that's pretty serious. That's pretty
00:15:28 serious. Yeah. And another one was I was there was a recently they cut down a giant tree and it was
00:15:38 like scaling up the logs because of course I would and I slipped, I tripped and what happened
00:15:45 somehow a piece of what's the outer layer of the bark. Yeah, the bark, a piece of bark got under
00:15:52 my toenails. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Anything involving toenails just like freaks me out. Yeah, it was
00:15:59 agree. It was it was terrible. I'm surprised it didn't fall off. At least I don't remember it doing
00:16:06 so. But yeah, were you wearing shoes? Like did it cut through your shoe or something? I was wearing
00:16:10 like, I think it's called sandals. Yeah, you were wearing goddamn woman. What are you doing climbing
00:16:16 trees wearing flip flops or something? It was it was it was summer. And the last one was quite
00:16:23 recent. I think it was last year. I think I was back in La Peña and my mother put a new carpet
00:16:34 in the room I was staying. And like the carpets was very slippery and a few times I was I sort
00:16:39 of slipped but I regained my balance and my mom was like, Oh, we shouldn't nail and we should nail
00:16:43 it down or something like that because I feel like one of us is going to trip. And I was like,
00:16:49 Yeah, we should totally do that. Do that. But same same day a bit later, we haven't done that.
00:16:54 And I was going into my room and I slipped really, really bad. I couldn't get my balance up and I
00:17:02 fell and I hit my hold on right side, the rib cage onto a table. And not only that, I skidded a bit
00:17:16 and some of my skin went off of my foot and I think I still have a scar. Hold on, let me check.
00:17:24 This carpet is evil. So the fact that the carpet was so loose, it just moved on the floor and it
00:17:31 Yeah, okay, okay. I'm pretty sure don't have the scar anymore. But that's good. Oh, no, no,
00:17:38 wait, wait, wait, there's still a little bit of it. There's still a hint of it, but it's fading away.
00:17:43 So Jesus, I'm definitely going to have scars from this from these fucking skateboarding wounds.
00:17:49 But you know what, you know, I was going to say about this, I kind of feel like a badass. So I'm
00:17:53 kind of just happy that it happened. You know, like it wasn't that bad. Everyone needs a little bit
00:17:59 of wear and tear to be a cool guy. So you know, maybe I've been a little too pampered. I feel
00:18:04 cool. I'm happy that I do it. Speaking of scars, a weird scar I have that still hasn't healed and
00:18:09 it baffles me to this day. I was playing with my cat and this is totally earned. He bit me. And
00:18:15 he doesn't bite me hard, but sometimes just enough to break the skin. And it still hasn't healed and
00:18:20 I swear it's been like just as long as like even longer than a year now. And like the skin on my
00:18:28 foot that had completely come off, it's almost almost completely gone. There's barely anything
00:18:33 there. But these tooth scars are just still there. Are they vampire mics? Mark's on your neck. Is it
00:18:40 a vampire cat? No, no, no. It's on my arm. On your arm. Yeah, like the two little streaks on my arm.
00:18:46 I know I have no idea why they're still there. Those platelets need to get to work. Yeah, healing
00:18:52 that shit. Shit, dude. Well, how about you, Tom? Anything like this? Well, I did break my leg in
00:18:58 elementary school. How'd that happen? I constantly had this bad habit and I still do it to this day
00:19:04 of like fucking running up and down stairs with reckless abandon because I just, I got places
00:19:10 to be. I don't have time to casually go down the stairs. Fuck that shit. And so my mom was always
00:19:17 like, you know, you keep doing that, you're going to fall down the stairs. I'm like, ah, dumb bitch,
00:19:20 you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. One time in sixth grade, it did happen. I did fall
00:19:26 down the stairs. I did break my leg and it did suck balls. So were you heading up the stairs
00:19:32 and then just like, oh no, I was going down. Gravity was totally out to get me that day. So you like
00:19:37 tumbled forward or something? Yeah, I slipped and it hurt. It was bad. And then I had to have a cast
00:19:44 for a while. And one of the things that I remember distinctly about this, I had crutches, all that
00:19:49 fucking bullshit, is that during the school I was at, the last period of the day, some days of the
00:19:57 week would be chorus. And I'd have to walk from once, you'd have to walk from one side of the
00:20:01 building to the other to get to the chorus class. And now I had to hobble on crutches and it was
00:20:06 very slow. And most of the time, it would take the entire period for me to crutch walk. Nobody
00:20:13 helped. Nobody waited. I would just show up at chorus and then it would be over and then have
00:20:17 to go all the way back to the other side to get my backpack. Are you kidding me? No, no, no. This
00:20:20 happened multiple times. I just like missed chorus because I just was hobbling my way from one
00:20:25 side of the building to the other, trying to get there. Well, fucking fumdus, Tom hobbling his
00:20:29 way across. Nobody helping him. Chorus sucked though. So I was totally okay with it and never
00:20:34 spoke up about it. So I'm like, yeah, if anyone ever gives me shit, I'll be like, I'm crippled.
00:20:38 Fuck you. Damn. So that was breaking my bone. What else happened?
00:20:43 Oh shit. Oh, when I was a little kid, I got attacked by my cat because I was a retard.
00:20:51 So Mike, I loved, my first cat was cool. He was a cool guy. He was this big fucking massive
00:20:56 death cat and I was a little wee lad of like eight years old and I loved this cat. He was
00:21:01 a cool cat. But one time we were out just hanging out with the neighbors and then their dog
00:21:08 tried to kill our cat. Oh shit, okay. And I had the dumb idea of running over to save
00:21:15 him because I was like, fuck you dog. Don't hurt my cat. He's the best. And my cat was
00:21:20 freaked out. So when I touched it, it attacked me because it thought it was being attacked
00:21:24 by another animal or something. Right. And it ripped my face open and shit. Oh fuck.
00:21:30 I had to get stitches on my eyebrow and let me tell you, that hurts like a bitch. I did
00:21:36 once get an eyebrow piercing so I can kind of relate. This is like getting your eyebrow
00:21:41 pierced like 16 times in a row. Yeah, that's way worse. It's not fun. I still have a little
00:21:46 scar there every time I squint. There's a little like fold there that shouldn't be there from
00:21:50 like a scar. It's very weird. Yeah. But I described getting my eyebrow pierced as like the worst
00:21:56 pain I've ever felt and feeling like a lightning bolt going through my face. Yeah, what it
00:22:00 felt like. Speaking about broken bones, this didn't happen to me, but I feel like I can
00:22:05 share the story. Sure. I was one time in camp and they had like the concentration camp. No,
00:22:12 no, it was regular camp. Just the buildings were like concrete or brick laid like two
00:22:19 story buildings with and what happened was like some boys decided to climb from the second
00:22:27 floor window to the second floor. What is with Eastern European people and climbing shit
00:22:32 where they shouldn't be doing and risking their lives. But okay, all right. From the
00:22:36 window to the balcony and we were like the girls were on the balcony were ready to sort
00:22:41 of like help them over and I was one of them and it's just it's so stupid. We should have
00:22:47 told them no, but I don't think they would have listened. Anywho, so they did doing that
00:22:52 and one boy sort of reached out and we tried to grab his hand, but we didn't manage to
00:22:56 grab his hand and he slipped and he fell. Oh God, from a second story. Yeah. And he broke
00:23:03 both his arms. What happened? He broke both his arms. Shit. He broke both his arms. Oh my God.
00:23:08 And so like you're there reaching out your hand and like he missed your hand. All right,
00:23:13 all right, mage, mage, be honest, be honest, mage. You did this on purpose, didn't you? You wanted
00:23:17 him to suffer the violent violence. No, no, no, no, no, no, I had a crush on this boy.
00:23:22 And you crushed him. So you had to see him crush below you.
00:23:26 Oh God. No, no, it was it was. It was a weird affection thing. That's the custom I just don't
00:23:34 understand. That is seriously though, you see those videos of like Russian boys like climbing
00:23:40 on these weird like just like freakishly tall like oil rigs and shit and like hanging off with
00:23:46 one arm dangling over nothing and like giving a thumbs up with like the other hand. You see that
00:23:51 shit? I mean, that's what it reminds me of. Jesus Christ. There's a yearning for death in the Eastern
00:23:57 European population, I think. I can relate since I'm half Polish, you know, I get it. Fascinating.
00:24:05 Yeah, they called the ambulance and he, you know, wasn't in camp for the rest of the time.
00:24:09 I would hope so. Did his arms heal okay? I mean, did he? I think so. Like by the time it got out,
00:24:15 I went to actually visit him because I was I lived near the hospital. Well, not near the
00:24:20 hospital, but it was a walk away. And I went to visit him and he was already out. So. Oh, that's
00:24:26 good. Okay. Well, still. God damn. That's pretty fucking funny. It wasn't. He's the important
00:24:38 question that made you guys ever hook up after that? You ever go anywhere with that crush?
00:24:43 The thing is that we might have, maybe, but his mother was a psycho. So. Oh,
00:24:50 cockblock by mom. The worst fate. I was going to say, having both arms paralyzed can put a man
00:24:58 in a compromising position at a formative young years and will need assistance with various activities.
00:25:06 Well, I mean, okay, I guess that that's pretty much it. Any other traumatic stories? I mean,
00:25:11 there was the time that I just kicked Ben for no reason. That was pretty funny, but it wasn't
00:25:14 really a serious injury or anything. Was there anything else? I mean, I had crazy fevers when
00:25:21 I was young, but that's not the same kind of. Yeah, and axe fell on me and almost cut my head off,
00:25:26 but only to cut my finger instead. Oh, I mean, how bad did it hurt the finger? Not bad at all.
00:25:33 Like I still have like a scar on my finger from where it like sliced a bit of flesh open and
00:25:38 had to get stitches and everything. But like if I had not moved when I did, it would have like
00:25:43 hit the back of my neck and probably killed me. So that was cool. God was just like, no,
00:25:50 you still got another couple of decades of suffering, boy. I mean, there wasn't at one time.
00:25:58 I know I've told this before where I was just what I was on a bunk bed. I like flipped up.
00:26:02 I was like on the bottom bunk, but there were bars above. I grabbed those bars. I flipped upside
00:26:06 down as I like to do on those to like do flips. And one time I was just hanging upside down head
00:26:10 down. And I was like, this will be fun. And I just let go and dropped onto my head and nearly
00:26:15 snapped my fucking neck like for fun. I don't know what I was thinking, but it seemed fun at the time.
00:26:22 But that's how it goes. That's how it goes. Yeah, yeah, that's just really all there is to it.
00:26:26 Really stupid retarded ideas, I suppose. Yeah, well, I guess that's it. I guess that's it.
00:26:35 Yeah. Don't die, kids. Yeah, try not to do this. Don't do dangerous things. A little bit. If you're
00:26:41 going to do dangerous things, you know, prepare your will ahead of time and I don't know, make sure
00:26:49 it's worth it. Like I've done skydiving and could have died, but it's actually pretty safe. Safety
00:26:54 precautions. Yeah. And I did it in tandem. One thing I remember. It wasn't an injury or anything,
00:27:01 but it was very scary. So, you know, like those thermometers that have like, what's it called?
00:27:08 Mercury in them, I think, right? Yeah. And mercury is poisonous when it's like gas, right?
00:27:14 Yep, sure is. It's liquid, too. But yeah. Yeah, so I broke a thermometer and I was really scared
00:27:20 of telling my parents, so I hid it. But then, thankfully, I came clean because where I hid it
00:27:25 was the bedroom. And well, if I hadn't told them, I dread to think what would have happened.
00:27:32 You know, on that specific thing, my mom told me, you know, my mom like grew up in like the 50s
00:27:38 and 60s and stuff. Well, most of the 60s, but whatever. A point is like, when she was a kid,
00:27:43 she told me the other day, or this was years ago, she's like, yeah, well, like when we were kids,
00:27:47 we used to intentionally crack open like mercury thermometers and just like fuck around with the
00:27:52 mercury and just like, you know, play with it and like roll it around. And she's like,
00:27:56 this may have been a bad idea. Fucking terrible idea. I mean, yeah, but how the fuck this was
00:28:02 like before they knew, I guess. Yeah, it's just like, oh, because like mercury is kind of cool.
00:28:07 It's really cool. It's liquid metal. It's dope. It's pretty sick, too bad. Everything that's cool
00:28:14 is also bad for you. Unfortunately. Yeah, like dropping onto your neck from a bunk bed. It's
00:28:20 cool as hell. But damn it. It's a forbidden snack. The worst thing for you. It's a forbidden fun.
00:28:25 Yeah. Yeah. Oh, God. Yeah. You should title this segment forbidden fun, aka traumatic injury. Yeah,
00:28:32 exactly. I mean, those those girls who cut themselves because their emo seem like they're
00:28:38 having a good time. Yeah. Well, if it's good enough for emo girls, good enough for me, you know,
00:28:44 that's my that's my bar. Shit. So so anyone. Alright, well, what else we got on the table?
00:28:52 I got another thing to talk about. But you got you guys you guys got a I'm done. I'm done with
00:28:57 injuries. So if you want to move on to something else, please please save me from my floundering.
00:29:02 I did have a funny thing happen to me right before this episode began. And this is I got to start
00:29:07 today's episode of the PGP the Pokemon Go podcast, which is just to say that my mom calls me
00:29:14 so my mom visited me in Cincinnati recently at the legendary encounter legendary cat of being on
00:29:19 the Shekels for heckles episode and whatnot. And while she was here, I got her introduced to Pokemon
00:29:27 Go and got her playing a little bit. And she seems pretty into it. And the way I can definitely
00:29:31 tell is that she just called me asking for like help. And she she was walking the dog beanie.
00:29:37 And she was just like, Nate, how do I or I just got a thing I'm going to polka stops to get polka
00:29:45 balls. But I'm it's telling me max I've got max capacity for items. What do I do? So I explained
00:29:52 to where you got to throw away items you don't need you can upgrade if you pay money or you have
00:29:56 due gym battles, which I'm sure she has not done yet. Or but mostly just throw away items to get
00:30:02 more polka balls and stuff. So yeah, I guess what I'm saying is that was funny. And parents will
00:30:10 never get it. It's interesting, like because like Pokemon Go is one of those games that's
00:30:16 definitely like got like normie potential. Yeah, Pokemon like the Pokemon spin off game seem to
00:30:21 be good with that. Like my parents hate video games, think they're gay, think I've wasted my
00:30:26 entire life and they're not wrong. But they are both huge fans of Pokemon snap and we would play
00:30:34 that together all the time. And my mom like beat that game and played it multiple times. Wow. And
00:30:41 like, interesting doesn't play video games hates them a lot. But Pokemon snap for the n64 was her
00:30:49 jam. And she was obsessed with it just as much as we were back in the day. Wow. And I don't was a
00:30:55 little bit like that with racing games. He never really played much, but he always like showed an
00:31:00 interest whenever it came up, which was interesting. My dad is like into video games, but doesn't play
00:31:06 them and is in denial about it. Like my dad is just like a nerd in denial. Like at some point,
00:31:12 he got like bullied in schools who became jacked and like learned how to fight and like became one
00:31:16 of those guys. But but he was before that he was a nerd. He's left that identity behind.
00:31:22 But it's still there. He just ignores it to the best of his abilities. I think my dad
00:31:27 generally likes video games, but he doesn't play them at the moment. I remember in my childhood,
00:31:32 he would play. I don't remember the name of the game, but I think it was on a Nintendo console
00:31:38 because I remember we also had like the original Mario's that my sister and me played and he played
00:31:43 like this other one where you had to build like a maze sort of for tanks to battle like and and
00:31:51 then yeah, you built the battlefield basically and then you maneuvered around it with one little
00:31:57 tank while five other tanks went after you. So you had to yeah, it was quite fun. And the other
00:32:03 two games I remember him playing would be like Doom and Doom 2. So yeah, yeah, that's some good
00:32:09 I guess on Doom 3. Yeah. So, you know, the Doom series. Sadly, his computer is not strong enough
00:32:15 to handle the newest doom. So we cannot probably play that on your fucking phone these days or
00:32:20 something. I tried. I tried. It didn't run. Oh, yeah. Get a new graphics card. Just go out buy GTX
00:32:26 1060 slap it in your nest machine and yeah. Yes, my dad had bad might and magic for the PC.
00:32:37 Him and my uncle would would hang out together and play might and magic for the PC back in the day.
00:32:42 And that was a cool game. I played that a little bit later in life because I was a little child.
00:32:47 I ruined one of their might and magic games when I was when I was like a very young kid like
00:32:52 younger than five because I've come a long way with computers in my life. Now I can like build
00:32:57 computers. I can put them together. I can do all this cool shit with them. I'm basically that
00:33:01 IT guy right now at for I am games. It's like my job. But back in the day, they were playing
00:33:07 might and magic like three, I think, for like DOS and I came downstairs and I thought the computer
00:33:13 was hungry. So I shoved a cookie into the floppy drive and crashed the whole thing. Are you kidding
00:33:17 me? Are you fucking serious? No. Okay. Why did you think it was hungry? What a fascinating
00:33:23 I can relate, though. I had the same experience. What? Are you kidding me? Like, I think it was
00:33:30 like a what's it called? VCR thing? VCR. No, no, the tapes. Yeah, the tapes, those big tapes,
00:33:37 big bulky tapes. Yeah, VCR. Yeah, I thought it was hungry. So because I put like metal bits inside
00:33:45 of it instead of like a cookie because it's a metal thing. It eats metal of things.
00:33:50 Mage went to the next level. And what about like a TV being thirsty? Oh, no. Oh, God. You didn't pour
00:33:58 shit on a TV, did you? I pour liquid into the TV. You got to water the TV. Why? Why? It was thirsty.
00:34:06 Okay, wait, stop, stop. What made you think specifically that they were hungry and or thirsty?
00:34:13 I don't know. What was it? This is like 25 years ago. I was I'm not going to recall my thought process.
00:34:18 I was like a literal baby. Yeah, I was five or less years old. I can tell you that much. Five or less.
00:34:23 Because like, I could see think like, okay, you see like a floppy disk drive, and it kind of looks
00:34:28 like an open mouth, right? I sort of get the connection there. But like, was there something
00:34:34 on the screen that said like, feed me? I mean, I don't know. I think me and Mage both just have
00:34:40 like, like had stupid amounts of empathy as children. Yeah, I still have stupid amounts of
00:34:46 empathy. Yeah, I try and crush that feeling every day.
00:34:50 Well, for the yeah, that's good. But for the TV being thirsty, like, where did you pour the liquid
00:34:57 into? Remember back when TVs used to be like super bulky and not like flat screens. So on the back,
00:35:04 there would be like, slits to get like the hot air out. So I did that. Oh, God.
00:35:11 Surprisingly, right onto the CRT, like, like, yeah, surprisingly, dear God, it did not ruin the TV
00:35:18 because I turned it off right afterward. And I think it had time to dry. Oh, and just did anybody
00:35:25 know? Did you ever confess your crime? No one? No one knew. Oh, man, the perfect crime.
00:35:33 Watering the TV. So did did your shoving food or metal bits into the VCR?
00:35:39 Oh, that's right. Oh, that's fucked it up.
00:35:45 What metal bits did you shove in there? Like, where did actually this metal shavings hanging
00:35:51 around? It was it was from, um, uh, I guess when you live in the desolate wasteland of the violent
00:35:58 violence, there's metal bits all over the place. A brush, a hairbrush. There we go. A hairbrush.
00:36:03 A metal hairbrush? Yeah, the metal is spiky bits. Oh, yes. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, so
00:36:12 oh, but this is funny because this is kind of the origin story of how I learned English because
00:36:17 once the VCR was fucked up, my parents got me cable, which had Cartoon Network in it and me
00:36:22 being four to five years old, I didn't care what language they spoke. So I, you know, it's just
00:36:26 pretty cartoons. So I watched TV a lot and that's how I learned English. So this was like a formative
00:36:32 moment of your life. If you hadn't fed the VCR, you might not even be able to talk to us at this
00:36:38 point. At least with very broken English. My God, who would have known that at this point,
00:36:44 reality is forked and there's another fork of reality where mage decided, you know what,
00:36:48 I guess the VCR is not hungry and then none of her life is the way it is now.
00:36:53 What a fascinating situation. The butterfly effect for sure. Holy shit. What about you,
00:36:58 Tom? So shoving the cookie into the floppy disk drive, how much did that fuck it up?
00:37:04 I guess that fucked up their game and they couldn't finish. So was the disk in there currently
00:37:09 or something? It must have been. It must have been because there's no way, because even,
00:37:14 I think about it now, there's no way that shoving something into a floppy drive would kill the
00:37:18 entire computer because all the actual components are way far away, but they must have been running
00:37:23 off of floppy disk and that just broke the game. The computer itself probably still worked.
00:37:28 Yeah, probably. Yeah, it's pretty stupid. Definitely. I've come a long way.
00:37:36 Guys, remember floppy disks? I do. I used floppy disks back in the day.
00:37:41 I used to use floppy disks. It's just so amazing now how much stuff we can cram onto disks and
00:37:48 stuff. I think a floppy disk, if I remember correctly, I think they had a limit of about
00:37:52 two megabytes if I remember correctly. It was 1.44 megabytes. Yeah, there you go. I have no idea
00:37:57 why it was that number, but that's what it was. Do you guys remember before those floppy disks,
00:38:02 like the bigger floppy disks, like the floppy disks that were actually floppy and they held
00:38:06 even less data? Oh, I remember those, but I never used them. I've never used them, but I know they're
00:38:10 real. I know they're a thing that existed. It was ironic that floppy disks were actually pretty
00:38:15 solid. I mean, they were made of plastic. You could bend them a little bit, but... Yeah, I don't,
00:38:19 I don't know. I wonder what people would call floppy disks. Well, because like Tom was saying,
00:38:24 I think the original versions were quite large and were literally floppy. They were like bendy
00:38:29 plastic. Does anybody remember the classic PSA video about piracy back in the day in the 90s
00:38:36 called, Don't Copy That Floppy? You remember the phrase, but I don't think I've seen it. It's a
00:38:42 cheesy 90s rap video about some guy telling kids, Don't Copy That Floppy. It's hilarious. Damn,
00:38:48 the 90s were a different time. It was amazing. That's hilarious, because a lot of the games
00:38:55 that I owned or got to play back in those days were bootlegs or pirated versions. Exactly,
00:39:01 there was no copy protection back in the day, so their copy protection was, Please Don't Do That.
00:39:06 The times sure have changed. We used to use rap to get kids to stop copying that floppy. Now we
00:39:12 use rap to get kids to smoke crack. The world's always changing. And sip that lean.
00:39:24 Well, shit. What a fascinating story. That was a great diversion or a great tangent. That was
00:39:29 absolutely delicious, delectable. I've got one other thing I wanted to bring up, which is just
00:39:34 what we were talking about right before this episode, which is about addictions, specifically
00:39:39 sugar. Let's talk about the worst part of the human condition. It's addiction to sugar.
00:39:47 I would argue that that's part of a larger issue. It's definitely there, but we're just slaves to
00:39:53 our biology to such a massive degree. We don't actually need sugar. Yeah, we don't actually
00:39:58 need it though, I don't think. Unless you're a bodybuilder or traveling on stuff, you actually
00:40:04 need a lot of energy. Yeah, that's true. That's true. But no, here we are. All of us, I think,
00:40:10 kind of struggle to varying degrees with resisting the temptation to eat just junk food and shit.
00:40:18 It's tough. It's real fucking hard. I can give up almost anything except for sugary stuff.
00:40:25 It's tough. Again, because I've been doing keto like Ben for the last three weeks,
00:40:29 I've had no sugar. I've become addicted to diet soda because it's the only sweet thing I can have.
00:40:33 I've been slowly easing into keto because like I still had a lot of leftover food that need to
00:40:38 be eaten. Like I said, I ordered the candy corn before I decided to go keto. Sure. I mean,
00:40:47 that's been lasting me several days, so a few pieces a day, so it's not going to be too much.
00:40:54 Man, there was a time in my life, and I want to get back to it. I'm working to get there,
00:41:00 and Huell and all this stuff is helping me, where I just, I had mastered this. I had conquered it.
00:41:06 I went a year without fast food. I think actually I might have eaten it one time,
00:41:10 and a year without soda, and I still don't drink soda like ever, and actually this time is what
00:41:14 broke me on soda. I just don't care anymore, but I definitely eat more junk food than that now,
00:41:19 and I just, I want to get back. This is an interesting thing about diet. It's like,
00:41:24 this is almost a problem with the internet now is that there's just so much information. I have no
00:41:29 idea what's true anymore. That's true. Because I've done research on diet, and I've tried to
00:41:34 look up things casually, just like, all right, what's the best thing to eat? And there's no
00:41:39 consensus. I was on Twitter, and this is just the most recent example of me thinking of this,
00:41:45 is I was on Twitter, and one of the people I follow on Twitter is a religious vegan,
00:41:50 like insanely vegan. All they do is just make art and products about how good it is to be vegan,
00:41:55 and fuck you if you're not vegan. They're arts great, so I follow them anyway, and I knew them
00:41:59 from like back in the pony days and stuff, but they've transitioned from pony to vegan.
00:42:05 Between two religions. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So you know, Church of Twilight to the Church of
00:42:10 Chicken, I don't know. So a shout out to them, they're great, but vegan.
00:42:16 I think all the characters, if I think about it, are probably vegan in my little pony.
00:42:20 I suppose- They eat milk products in pony shit. That's true. They're vegetarian though,
00:42:24 they're close. They're vegetarian, yeah. So yeah, so there was just a thread that they had
00:42:30 retweeted, and I just kind of looked through it, because I'm always interested. I'm interested
00:42:34 in the zealot mindset, because I want to instill it in my audience, so they'll never abandon me.
00:42:39 So I'm always taking peeks, trying to peel back the layers and figure out how to do it.
00:42:45 And this thread was just like people going back and forth fighting about
00:42:48 diet and veganism, and people are like, no, no, no, you don't understand, like the best,
00:42:52 like if you look at like ancient Asian cultures and stuff, all they would do is eat
00:42:57 like nothing but carbohydrates and sugars, and they'd live to be like 107. That's how people
00:43:01 do now. That's the most healthy thing to do. And people are like, no, no, no, we couldn't
00:43:04 evolve without eating meat, and meat's the most important thing. You can't have carbohydrates,
00:43:08 or pores that are exhaled with carbs. You got to go fats and proteins. And it's like,
00:43:13 I don't know which one's right. There's evidence on both sides. What are we supposed to do?
00:43:17 Science is not settled. It's really not.
00:43:19 So because I'm doing keto, and I'm like, am I being healthy? Because there's like a
00:43:24 huge subset of people who'd be like, you're eating the worst shit possible for you,
00:43:29 and you're going to die early of like coronary heart disease. And like, maybe that's true.
00:43:34 See, I think people, when they say like, oh, you know, your arteries are gonna get
00:43:41 clogged up with fat and stuff like that, because they've always considered like,
00:43:47 hold on, how to words? Let me words. So when you're consuming both carbohydrates and fat
00:43:56 in large quantities, yeah, like the fat is going to get unhealthy for you. But if you
00:44:01 just focus on just fat and not carbohydrates, I think that sort of balances out. I'm, you know,
00:44:07 I mean, I don't know. It's just, it's just someone, I'm just someone who read stuff.
00:44:11 So, you know, I'm no professional. I think that's the, the general like thrust behind
00:44:16 keto is that like, you're, you're burning fat for energy now. So it's not getting caught in
00:44:21 your body. Because if you're eating a ton of fat, but you're burning the carbohydrates,
00:44:24 your body's not doing anything with the fat and it just kind of like sticks to you.
00:44:29 Yeah, because the body priority is carbohydrates. And yeah, the fat just
00:44:33 sets in into your body. Because it's basically just sugars. Like carbohydrates break down
00:44:36 immediately into sugars and it's the easiest to process. I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I'm
00:44:41 not a smart person. So it's just like, I'm just a normal human being that is terrified of death
00:44:48 and wants to live long enough to make it to the technological singularity. But during that time,
00:44:53 I want to look swole and good and, and get some puss. So I'm just, I'm just in this,
00:44:59 this middle ground like, what do I do? How do I maximize? How do I biohack properly? That's
00:45:05 what I wanted until I can just get real technical like machine hacking with my robot limbs. I got
00:45:10 a biohack and we don't understand the language yet. So it's very fucking confusing because I don't
00:45:15 know what the fuck to do. Right, Tom? I've been going to the gym three times a week for the last
00:45:20 like three and a half, four months. That's great. That's tremendous. I'm trying to step it up to
00:45:25 five times a week at some point. I'm just lazy. Now it doesn't necessarily have to be, it's not
00:45:32 necessarily better to work out more times. I mean, there, there's different plans. So if it's
00:45:36 like easier, like with me, it's easier to work out three times a week. So I found a plan that's
00:45:41 like optimized for that. And you just do the workout that's assigned. So I'm just saying,
00:45:45 like one can, the question is not settled as like, yeah, five workouts are definitely better than
00:45:50 three works out. A lot of it depends on what you're trying to do. That's my point again. You
00:45:53 know, it's the same. It's like, what the fuck? Like how, how do you would think after a couple
00:45:57 thousand years, we'd figure out the baselines of like how this like system works. And we're not
00:46:02 even fucking close. In terms of dieting, in terms of dieting, I think during like the world wars,
00:46:08 they kind of falsified information to fatten people up or something like that. So and a lot
00:46:15 of people who are older dietitians, they still sort of base it on their old knowledge. And
00:46:22 but because, you know, they're the experienced people, all the newer people base it off of
00:46:27 their knowledge. And you know, it just kind of get passed on, whereas some newer people, the
00:46:31 upstarts, you know, have some new data and that's hard to believe. Here's an interesting fact
00:46:37 that is, it's not totally settled or anything, but like, so like if you're trying to gain muscle,
00:46:42 right, we all know that protein is important for that. Okay, how much protein should one eat?
00:46:47 Until very recently, there really was not an agreed upon answer to that. The general agreement was
00:46:54 a lot. And the amount that had been thrown out was like one gram of protein every day per
00:47:01 pound of body mass you have. I think it was pound of lean body mass. If you're really fat, you're
00:47:05 not going to get, you know, if you eat 400 grams of protein, that's not actually beneficial.
00:47:10 Because you got so much excess fat there. But it's but like just recently, my voice Scooby 1961,
00:47:15 who had some good time to bring him in because he's the guy who I've learned the most from over
00:47:19 the years. Everyone should listen to him if you have interest in health and fitness at all.
00:47:24 He reported in a video that there was a large, I forget what it's called, but like a multi-stage
00:47:31 like comprehensive analysis that had been done of many independent like protein analysis
00:47:39 like studies that were tracking like specifically muscle gain based on protein consumption.
00:47:45 And see, this is not totally settled. But the information that was assembled indicates that
00:47:51 the ideal amount is actually 0.7 not one gram of protein per pound of body mass, but 0.7 grams.
00:48:00 As in if you weigh 100 pounds and you're lean, muscley guy, then you would want to eat 70 grams
00:48:05 of protein per day to gain muscle. And if you can eat more, but you won't get any benefit. That is
00:48:11 like basically the optimal amount. And like and the other important information that was found was
00:48:15 that because people that speculate for a long time like, you know, like way is basically milk protein
00:48:21 that comes from milk. You could eat like chicken to get straight up like muscle, you know, animal
00:48:26 protein, or you could get like like lima beans of protein, you could get like people have lima
00:48:30 bean protein you can just take. And then the analysis concluded, it didn't matter what kind of protein
00:48:37 they ate. As long as you just get that 0.7, you know, grams of protein per pound of lean body
00:48:43 mass, then you will gain at optimal speeds of muscle. And it doesn't matter what kind of protein
00:48:50 you eat. That was like the big conclusion. And like you'd think that we would have figured that
00:48:55 shit out way long ago. But only now are people starting to understand any of this shit. And
00:49:02 there's so much more to know that we don't know. And when you bring in the question of health,
00:49:07 specifically, health is such a complex thing. And there's so many systems that are involved,
00:49:14 like there is no going to be one answer like this is the healthiest way to live.
00:49:18 Because it's like the problem becomes is that like health, because like, no, it's not like all
00:49:25 human bodies work exactly the same way based on the region you're from, like your genetics kind of
00:49:30 like have tweaked a little bit to like better suit that environment. And then like, within that
00:49:35 individuals are different as well. So like, we got to like have some fucking futuristic tech or
00:49:42 just scans your body and like, all right, based on your genetic makeup and shit, this is your ideal
00:49:46 diet to keep you at peak condition. Hey, guys, here's a here's a here's a here's a conspiracy
00:49:51 theory for yes, since we talked about earlier. Yeah. So the dietitian sort of people in America,
00:49:59 it's it's quite a huge business, isn't it? Oh, it's panic. And if in and if everyone suddenly
00:50:05 got thin, they'd be out of business now, weren't they wouldn't they would that's certainly true.
00:50:10 So they are making people not get thinner, because they wouldn't right, right. No, this isn't even
00:50:17 a joke. Like it's I was actually going to bring this up next is that like, I think a reason a lot
00:50:21 of this alternate diet stuff is even coming up now is because with the internet, you can like,
00:50:25 there's financial incentive at this point to like delve deeper into this shit, because if you can
00:50:30 figure out the next like, diet craze, you can make a fuck ton of money off it. Yeah, which people
00:50:34 do six back shortcuts and what exactly. So like, there's, there's all this conflicting research
00:50:39 and stuff now, because everyone's like cherry picking, so their program can work. And it's just
00:50:45 like, again, the internet has this huge influx of information. Yeah, and I think the traditional
00:50:52 food pyramid was definitely because like there was like excess grains and like American like
00:50:56 industry. So they put grains as like the most important part so they could sell more that
00:51:00 shit. I think I think that's definitely good. And out of this swirling chaos of information,
00:51:05 things will emerge. I would argue though, that I think frankly, we really know the most important
00:51:11 things. The problem is, they require large amounts of effort over a long period of time,
00:51:17 because we know right now, if people, and this is available to like basically almost every American,
00:51:23 if you exercise probably every day, cardio and weightlifting, or maybe just both are good,
00:51:31 if you, if you exercise a lot, and you like eat lots of vegetables, like that really is the key,
00:51:38 just eat lots of vegetables and like beans and stuff, and do not eat junk food, like just,
00:51:43 just skip it all. Skip cake, skip cupcakes, you know, skip all that stuff, skip candy and you
00:51:48 just eat. I know, I'm just saying, see, that's the thing, nobody wants to do it. I mean, the really
00:51:55 disciplined like what we'd lift our bodybuilder guys, like they do it, because like it's kind of
00:52:00 important, like for whatever reason they've decided it's worth doing, worth sacrificing that stuff
00:52:05 to get these. But like to your average American who's just living their life and is like,
00:52:09 wait, wait, why are you asking me to like stop eating sugar, just that I'll get healthy, but like
00:52:15 that doesn't sound fun, and I have to do it forever. What's the fun of being healthy if you're miserable?
00:52:20 I mean, I, that's okay, see that, we need to break the, we need to break the conditioning,
00:52:25 you need to break the, the link between having sugar. No, no, no, I get you, I'm all, I'm all,
00:52:29 I'm all for health, it is, and it's definitely a struggle, but I would like to find a balance between
00:52:35 I ask that question, I ask that question myself all the time, like when me and Michelle go out,
00:52:41 Michelle eats like a bunny, and she'll just get a salad, and I'll be like, but I want a burger,
00:52:45 why can't I just have a cheeseburger with bacon? Why are you bullying me to get a salad, you fucking
00:52:51 asshole? Why do you hate me so much? And I just think like, I don't want to live in a world where
00:52:56 I can't eat a cheeseburger right now, so fuck it. Just get it, just get it, the lettuce wrap, it's
00:53:01 basically a salad at the end. I wish they offered that in the UK, I swear. I gotta do that. I don't
00:53:06 think they do, I don't think they offered it in the UK. That's, I've literally been living off of
00:53:11 bacon burgers and lettuce wraps. I kind of live in the ghetto, so I'm not sure they would have
00:53:16 lettuce wraps if I, if I try, but I do need to try, at least at some point. Five guys and Wendy's
00:53:21 will do it. I went to Burger King and they looked me like I had three heads when I asked for a
00:53:25 lettuce wrap, so I just walked out, and I was like, no, never mind. There's five guys and Wendy's not
00:53:30 too far. I should, I should make a trip and report back. Five guys is definitely better,
00:53:35 and it's worth it. There's five guys not too far from me. I never been there. Maybe we should both
00:53:40 try in the coming week to get there and try this lettuce wrap business. But I'm socially anxious,
00:53:46 I'll have to actually ask something off of the menu. No, no, no, it's on the menu. It's something
00:53:51 you can get there. It's not like a weird substitute. They offer lettuce wraps. Okay, okay, I'll look at
00:53:56 the menu. I look at the menu, and if they don't have it, I'm not going to ask about it. I mean,
00:54:02 every time I've asked for a lettuce wrap, they've just hit a button and it's come up on the screen
00:54:05 and it's on the receipt as well. Okay, that's a good sign. Okay, yeah, but you're in America. Maybe
00:54:09 they don't do that in UK. Okay, hang on. New subject real quick, social anxiety. Why in God's name
00:54:17 would it be a problem to go to a place, ask for a thing, and then to face the sheer terror in
00:54:23 realizing they do not have it on the menu. Just imagine the horror as their as that confused
00:54:30 look crosses their face. I don't like interacting with people. I've slowly been trying to conquer
00:54:36 this because I just like what I try and do in these situations is if like if the roles were
00:54:40 versed, I wouldn't give a fuck. So they don't give a fuck because I don't give a fuck about
00:54:44 anybody around me 99% of the time. And neither do they. I try that guiding principle. Yeah,
00:54:51 I try that too. I keep telling myself and that that sort of helps me just move in a public space.
00:54:58 I feel you. I feel you. I think, okay, don't don't give me a moment here. I think what would help
00:55:05 mage is if someone had a gun to your head. What helps me usually is to have someone near me
00:55:15 like next to me like a friend or something like that. That's usually helpful.
00:55:20 But it doesn't work miracles though. I still wouldn't be able to ask about the wrap.
00:55:26 I literally, you know, I used to have some, I don't know. And I still every once in a while,
00:55:30 I do like sometimes I'll just avoid going to the coffee machine like at work just like,
00:55:34 oh, there's someone there. I'll go later, which is a pussy move. And I shouldn't do,
00:55:37 but I still do do it sometimes. I think I told you guys about the time where I didn't go into a store
00:55:42 to buy myself Pokemon plushies. Yeah, even though you wanted it. Yeah. Yeah, which is so sad.
00:55:49 We all need to overcome this, you know, we all need to. How can we let anxiety about what people
00:55:55 say get in our way? I've been getting better. I mean, like, I think I talked about you specifically.
00:56:00 Yeah, just saying, just saying. It's I mean, you're never it's always going to be a struggle,
00:56:04 but like every time you push back, I find it gets a little bit easier the next time. It's
00:56:08 really it's a muscle, I think. And like if you if you don't exercise it, like I've noticed this
00:56:13 because like, I don't know, like I have a real job, I have to interact with people. So I'm kind
00:56:17 of forced to to exercise some of this stuff a lot. But like if I worked at home and like,
00:56:22 for example, was a YouTuber, I would like never have to go out, I would probably continue to be
00:56:26 an awkward weirdo and you know, who would not develop these these skills and stuff. So it's
00:56:33 kind of good that this is why I say the gun to your head is like, I try to think when I'm in
00:56:38 these situations sometimes less so now, but especially in the past, I think like, what if I
00:56:43 had to do this or I die, could I do it? And then I think, yeah, absolutely, I absolutely could.
00:56:49 And then that that I find that helpful, at least to a degree.
00:56:54 That puts it in perspective, it feels like the end of the world until you're like,
00:56:58 actually, it's really not. And I really I think a lot about welcome to the NHK when I'm in situations
00:57:03 like that, because it's basically social anxiety, the show. And, you know, I like because there's a
00:57:09 character in it, of course, famously, who like, just cannot do anything. He just his social anxiety
00:57:16 is so bad that he just doesn't leave his room ever. But then one time, like his sister leaves and
00:57:21 isn't coming to give him food. So if he stays there, he will just die. So basically, there's no
00:57:27 choice but to leave his room and go get a job. And he does so and he lived and actually he's way
00:57:31 happier afterward. So basically, what I'm saying is, hire a get biter to threaten your life and
00:57:39 say he's going to kill you. If you don't do XYZ, then if you don't get a lettuce wrap, he will shoot.
00:57:47 He'll put two in your skull. When there's no guns in the UK. At least we don't. Oh, I forgot. Okay,
00:57:53 well, what was it like? Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife are like the guns of
00:57:55 the UK now, basically. Potato Peelers. Potato Peelers. Potato Peelers. That's what it was. Oh
00:58:01 my God, you're right. That was a thing. Hellas. Goddamn. Sad as well. It's pretty sad. Pretty
00:58:08 strange. Well, shit. Do you want to want to pivot into into something that me and Digi were talking
00:58:15 about? And I want to bring it up. Actually, I was talking to Mage a little bit about it before we
00:58:18 started. So I guess Digi and May have been watching Pokemon analysis videos constantly,
00:58:24 because we have a computer now in the kitchen. So while they're cooking, old anime or like the
00:58:28 new one? Like the games and stuff. Oh, okay. They've been watching like just videos on like,
00:58:32 because I guess like there's a huge contingent of like the Pokemon fandom that's just dedicated to
00:58:37 like breaking the old games and finding weird shit out about them. We saw some of that and the
00:58:41 Pokemon race here on the program yesterday. But there's there's a fuck ton of that going on,
00:58:46 apparently. So they've been watching videos like that. But then I just happened to come down
00:58:50 when they were watching this video about a ROM hack of Pokemon Crystal called Pokemon Crystal
00:58:55 Clear. I've heard of that. And it was the coolest fucking shit I've ever seen in my goddamn life.
00:59:00 What's what's so cool that I haven't heard any of the details. So what Pokemon Crystal Clear is,
00:59:04 it's a ROM hack of Crystal, where you know how Pokemon Crystal usually plays. You start in Jodo,
00:59:09 you go to Council, you get like 16 badges, you can fight the leaf for it, and you go to Mount
00:59:12 Silver and fight red. Like that's the the progress of the game. Pokemon Crystal Clear changes it
00:59:18 so that you can start in Jodo or Kanto, either in New Bark or Pallet Town, you can customize
00:59:24 your character, you can choose from 25 different starters that all have different difficulty levels.
00:59:30 And then they've removed all the HM blocks in the entire map and edited it so you can go
00:59:37 anywhere you want in any order. So the game is completely open. It's like an open world.
00:59:42 Are there like, are there like levels? Like if you go to one area, will there just be like level
00:59:46 50 Pokemon? So like, well, I'm not going to go there. I'm gonna go. I think some of them have
00:59:50 like that, like the levels like scale and stuff. But I know the gym leaders can be done in any order
00:59:56 and they scale as you get more badges. So you can like you can go fight like Faulkner as the last
01:00:02 guy and have like a level 60 something Zapdos. But if you fight him first, he'll have his like
01:00:06 level nine Pidgey. So like it all scales like that. And you can rechallenge the gyms at any time at
01:00:11 any skill level. Now that's what I like to hear. Yeah. So like if you if you fight like say you
01:00:17 fight Faulkner first like you normally would and you have five badges, you can go back to the gym
01:00:21 and fight him at a level five gym level. So he has stronger guys. Fabulous. So it's fucking sick.
01:00:28 And so it's just like the best. I can't even imagine even wanting to play vanilla crystal
01:00:34 anymore because it sounds 10 times better. And then you run by default instead of walking. So
01:00:38 the movement speed is like triple nice. And there's tons of little like quality of life things
01:00:42 that enhance the sprites. The colors are more accurate. Oh, is the Pokemon Crystal the one
01:00:47 where you had to go to the mines and mine things? That's diamond. That's diamond. Okay. Yeah. Crystal
01:00:53 was like the remake, the addition to like golden silver, like the second gen games. So it's like
01:00:57 a Gameboy color rom hack. And like they just added a bunch of other little things like that. So
01:01:02 it's fucking amazing. And between that and SPV three, or just like it was just the Halo mod we
01:01:07 played on I am Games a couple weeks back where they just took Halo one for PC, reskinned it,
01:01:13 added all the guns and enemies from Halo two and three into it and like rebalance the whole
01:01:17 campaign around it and like added to the levels. Mods are just better than games. Like, like,
01:01:23 like, like, like the dedication of these people is amazing because like true Pokemon crystal clear
01:01:31 is a better idea than any Pokemon game that's come after it. Like that's just fucking sick. I think
01:01:39 based on Pokemon's track record, we basically we cannot count on the Pokemon company or Nintendo
01:01:45 to give us the Pokemon game that like we veterans would want. The rom hacks are the answer.
01:01:50 But like the weird thing is like and then like SPV three is a better Halo game than Halo four or
01:01:55 five by a significant degree. So it's just like, why are we playing games? We should just play mods.
01:02:03 Like how is like one person making these better like they're just better like mods are just I
01:02:07 would say I think there's there's there's something to be said that and this is not a criticism of
01:02:12 like the mods are but like the modders do have the benefit of kind of hindsight or like they're
01:02:17 able to take a game that was made you know 99% by someone else. They do the additional 1% of tweaks
01:02:24 that like everyone has agreed like this would make the game so much better and like they get to do
01:02:29 that. Maybe in like modern terms like like I know that I think in Hollow Knight for example,
01:02:34 like people thought that like the way that you get the final ultimate super duper extra like final
01:02:40 DLC DLC completion stuff was too hard. So I think they did nerf some of the bosses. That's a tool
01:02:46 that like is available to devs now that I kind of hate but they can make some of those tweaks that
01:02:51 might otherwise be like something that a modder would do. Here's here's the thing though that I
01:02:54 would argue there. I would say that Hollow Knight, this is kind of like I think Hollow Knight in terms
01:03:00 of like an indie game that we're talking about and like these mods they have more in common than
01:03:05 like a AAA game and Hollow Knight does because like what is Hollow Knight other than like someone
01:03:10 having an idea of like making a Metroidvania better and instead of just modding Symphony
01:03:16 of the Night or something they just made their own game. Like it's the same kind of idea like we
01:03:20 have these small teams of like individuals who are able to take these old concepts that like
01:03:25 modern companies are still iterating on but do it in a better way and I think it's just because
01:03:30 they're more in touch with the community and understand what people want. Yeah that's a big
01:03:35 one and I think there's like an old expression people say that it's like like with a big company
01:03:40 you you have like more manpower. What you're sacrificing is the unified vision. When you've
01:03:46 got like a small team or or like literally like one modder their unified vision like is able to
01:03:52 shine. So as long as they're able to like work with like other people's tools or maybe they make
01:03:57 like a really small project it can it can really shine kind of like like Undertale I guess which
01:04:02 is like a almost a one-man project or something. Yeah it's just it's core vision completely shines
01:04:07 through when you play that game or or Hall of Night with its like three-man team that made that
01:04:12 or whatever. So there's I mean I think it's just that like corporate influence and this is why I
01:04:17 think like Final Fantasy has kind of lost its way because like what was Final Fantasy? Final Fantasy
01:04:23 was it had a fairly big team but like they still had I don't know kind of like an indie attitude-ish
01:04:29 where like they would take some people's like weird kooky ideas like like the Sorceress and Final
01:04:35 Fantasy 8 was actually originally an idea they were going to put into Final Fantasy 7 but like
01:04:39 there was just too much shit already in that game like all right we're going to save this one and
01:04:43 then they made that kind of like the conceit like the main story of Final Fantasy 8. But the point
01:04:49 is it was just like weird shit that like people came up with and then they implemented because
01:04:54 like their their main thing was let's make an interesting game with these cool ideas that we
01:04:59 like and it like I'm not saying that they weren't thinking about like how to make a really successful
01:05:03 blockbuster because that definitely was on their minds but like they didn't it wasn't a Final Fantasy
01:05:09 15 that was like bait like as soon as Tabata took over not perhaps not originally with Nomura but
01:05:15 with Tabata it was like let's make a game that people like and will want to buy and that is like
01:05:21 the foremost thing so it's like community tell us what game we should make like tell us what you
01:05:26 want because we don't fucking know we're not auteurs we're not like creative people who are here to
01:05:31 like implement a vision no no no we're here providing a service and that's all we're here doing
01:05:36 you know it's the difference between like those two visions I guess something like that yeah
01:05:45 mods are better play mods are better yep we agreed okay guys hey uh switching topic I guess um
01:05:51 have you have you guys you probably have talked in a podcast before about Goblin Slayer right
01:05:57 yeah we I think a little bit not not too much okay because because I just I just watched the
01:06:02 four episodes that are out now okay okay what do you think I hold up but first can you like
01:06:09 break me on the controversy like I know people were saying rape is bad basically and so the
01:06:15 controversy is is to summarize it's it's this basically so the entire controversy was based
01:06:20 only on the first episode and nobody cares anymore as far as I can tell but but it was
01:06:26 basically this it was that the um the depiction of the violence and especially the rape that
01:06:32 was the big issue that you know canonically 100% does happen in episode one of Goblin Slayer um
01:06:38 was like explicit did not kind of warn people about the content because the show was like
01:06:44 advertised is kind of like a PG-13 um and then it also though I would say the rape does not
01:06:50 actually happen on screen it does technically happen off screen um and then and then uh people
01:06:55 felt that it also kind of sexualized and almost glorified the the rape and sexual violence and
01:07:02 normal violence okay I disagree with that part okay because you've watched four episodes now
01:07:08 yeah you've done way more research than anyone who's actually like who wrote those articles or
01:07:13 anything what it was like they showed just enough of that part to sort of to give people
01:07:20 idea of what was happening but they didn't glorify it they didn't sexualize it they didn't make it
01:07:25 look appealing at all and people who say that they did it it's just a grasping of straws honestly
01:07:33 like uh I feel like honestly no one would have given a shit if that scene wasn't there and people
01:07:39 are just being like way too sensitive about it I think I mean I if it was like PG-13 and stuff okay
01:07:45 I get it like like if I had been watching and that just came up without me knowing what I was getting
01:07:51 into it would have probably shocked me a little bit but like at the same time like we also have
01:07:57 anime like Attack on Titan and stuff and there's gonna be like gruesome gory shit out there it's
01:08:01 it's not surprising based on what people said though I think the answer is really quite clear
01:08:08 it's just that people are just super uncomfortable with rape I really think that's what it comes
01:08:14 down to and I I get it but I mean I don't know like it's it's weird multiple people got murdered
01:08:23 murdered dead they are deceased and yet the rape is the thing that people more focused on like I
01:08:30 get it I get it it's people frankly people just care more about sexual violence than just straight
01:08:36 up murder and stuff yeah that's it that's really all there is to it I think it's because when there's
01:08:40 when there's sexual assault like you know the victim could still talk about how bad it was but
01:08:44 if someone's dead they're fucking dead yeah I guess there's something there's kind of a finality to
01:08:48 murder that makes us kind of not care as much I sort of desensitize I think I did not pronounce
01:08:56 that right there's no murder survivors groups like making being activists and talking about how
01:09:01 murder is so which is kind of that that really sucks because like we really should be we should
01:09:06 be I would say opposing murder more than we're opposing rape I think that's fair to say I think
01:09:13 one is a worse crime or at the very least equally because there is no I don't know I'm confused
01:09:19 they're both terrible crimes basically but okay so the controversy aside though it's an interesting
01:09:25 anime I I'm actually interested to see where they're going I guess like minor spoilers I'm not sure
01:09:31 what exactly spoilers they're gonna slay some goblins basically I really like the character of the
01:09:38 goblin slayer he's just like not there and he's so calm and just like uh-huh yes affirmative
01:09:44 basically sort of character and then later on you find out his backstory which is very brief like
01:09:49 they didn't go you know into weepy story time but yeah you don't really need it yeah it was just
01:09:55 enough to know the fact and like I think because they didn't like the way they framed it is like
01:10:00 it's a story that a lot of people share he's not the only one he's not the special little boy
01:10:06 everyone like a lot of people have to go through this pain and yet people still dismiss goblins as
01:10:13 like a not a big threat and therefore he dedicates himself to slaying the goblins because no one
01:10:19 else does that was definitely a thing that a lot of people in the controversy were saying that like
01:10:24 because all those characters in episode one are kind of they're sort of framed to be like our main
01:10:29 character party guys and then people felt so sidelined by the fact that like oh my god guys
01:10:36 these characters like they didn't get fleshed out enough and like it was so weird to just watch them
01:10:40 all die when like I get why they're thinking but that litter that is the point of goblin slayer to
01:10:47 have they have they watched overlord specifically season three overlord probably not i was i was in
01:10:53 pain i was in torment what why what happened and i haven't people died and i like those people we
01:10:59 barely met them and the like we knew enough about them to emphasize and and empathize and you know
01:11:06 with me and empathizing with things and it's just it was it was terrible like um i guess spoilers
01:11:13 small spoilers for season three of overlord there's this girl and she has like she she's from
01:11:19 noble family and um but but they're falling on rough times and her parents are refusing to give
01:11:24 up the noble life so she has to go adventuring to to settle debts but she she has like no more i'm
01:11:31 gonna take my sisters and they're like two younger sisters they're both twins it's like i'm gonna take
01:11:36 my sisters and leave after this mission and they go to on this mission and she dies she not only dies
01:11:42 her body gets divided upon like the minions of the overlord and her voice is given to like one of
01:11:49 the maids it's just it's horrifying and then we get the scene we get the scene where like the
01:11:55 the two little sisters like oh i hope she comes back soon i can't wait we're going on a trip when
01:11:59 she comes back and it's just like you had to you had to go there you had to go there is to pull out
01:12:06 on your heart strings you know it's funny this whole goblin slayer thing because i haven't seen
01:12:10 the show i don't give a fuck whatever um i think i think i always thought like the reactions to like
01:12:15 rape and stuff is is overblown because like the the the shows that they talk about it's never
01:12:21 portraying rape is a good thing it's always done as like a hey look how fucking bad this is yeah
01:12:26 exactly so like that's the thing we're all on the same page about that like like do you know
01:12:31 that the villains and stories do bad things that's why they're villains that's always been my position
01:12:35 about it like let them do the bad things that just further uh you know reinforces the fact that
01:12:40 these are bad and shouldn't be done and this is a character you don't want to like doing something
01:12:45 you don't like yeah and there's a technically a reason why they do it because the i think what
01:12:50 what it is they there are no female goblins so they have to do this to reproduce to produce
01:12:54 that's in their nature that's great all right that's see that's that's kind of like disgusting but
01:13:00 also interesting but like okay here's my thing i was going to say can you imagine with all this
01:13:06 god would sell your bullshit can you imagine if the final episode of berserk 97 aired today
01:13:12 the shit show the shit show would be amazing the thing is okay the thing is the rape of kaspa
01:13:20 sorry the rape of kaska is an extremely fappable scene if if you can just like look
01:13:28 past the darkness that's happening but the thing is that is that is kind of the point
01:13:33 because it is it is it is an incredibly complex situation and i talked about this in my like
01:13:40 my videos about griffith and stuff like i said before and i stand by it it almost kind of looks
01:13:45 like kaska is enjoying it and it's on purpose because kaska is experiencing so many emotions
01:13:52 she has loved griffith and she's finally having sex with him and like it's it's it
01:14:00 look rapes bad how many times do you have to say it but like there's complex things going on here
01:14:05 and that's what makes the scene like so like discomforting it's literally art it's literally
01:14:11 art and look i'm sorry if like you have for whatever it's a personal thing or whatever like
01:14:16 you just can't stand rape i get it but like other people can stand it and can like you know
01:14:23 appreciate the the complex stuff being gotten at here and i just like this is it's literally marge
01:14:30 simpson turning off the tv and saying like i don't enjoy this so no one can enjoy this uh like this
01:14:36 is fictional you know there is no one actually being hurt but the thing is all this is propagated on
01:14:41 all the outrage for goblin slayer and you know the the whole thing about berserk and all that stuff
01:14:46 it all comes from i do think it comes from people perceiving the sexualization of the scene and like
01:14:52 the the almost glorification of it because i actually do think i do think that the author
01:14:58 having read the manga i've read a lot of the manga i do think that the author uh is kind of
01:15:04 sort of glorifying and sexualizing the scene i i do think that is happening the thing is though
01:15:09 i just don't mind it because i'm aware that like it's like yeah he's slipping in a little titillation
01:15:16 into the scene that's really fucked up i i do think that's happening but like how could he even avoid
01:15:22 it the man is an artist he is a mangaka this is a fictional thing that's happening no one is actually
01:15:28 being hurt but here's the thing this is where people this is why i understand why people deviate
01:15:34 from my opinion on this it's because the people who are outraged they perceive rape culture to be real
01:15:41 and they they think that like ah okay this is it this is what is propagating rape culture and they
01:15:47 see it and they think to themselves this is like this is going to hurt people because this is making
01:15:52 the problem worse you know it's it's not encouraging how much have we seen people being killed on screen
01:15:59 and in video games and yada yada and like i don't think i'm sorry this is my head i mean no hi that
01:16:08 that's the reasonable place to go to from there it's because it's again it's like i said it's
01:16:12 because nobody there's nobody left alive who can talk about how bad being murdered is yeah but like
01:16:17 i mean like the statistics it's not just because you you you see like people killing other people
01:16:23 on screen or in games or joke about murder or even suicide whatever it's not like it's not it
01:16:29 hasn't shaped the society to be okay with it it's still bad it's still against the law and it's
01:16:35 still a terrible thing and like we shouldn't forget but like i mean it's it's obvious and this was
01:16:39 said before but like the point of goblin slayer is these things are so evil with what they're
01:16:44 doing the goblin slayer is here to destroy them completely for what they have done uh it like
01:16:51 the thing is it is a literal anti rape message i guess it is anti but the the the sexualization
01:16:58 nugget in it people like like feminists and people who are really you know on this stuff they'll think
01:17:03 like uh you know they they say that they're saying that they're anti rape but really they're glorifying
01:17:09 it with this uh with the sexy ladies here on screen it's like ooh yeah that's that's good let's go do
01:17:15 that team but it's like it literally shows uh the goblins to be a bigger threat than people to give
01:17:21 them credit for and like how nasty and vile and terrible they really are i think that's the point
01:17:28 that's why the shock is like these goblins that everyone that dismisses is just little nuisances
01:17:33 they are actually these cretins i think that's the word you've just got to talk like when people
01:17:37 disagree i always think it's important to when there's a debate to agree on the terms of the
01:17:42 debate and and to be able to articulate the other person's message i think people who object to the
01:17:47 show would would concede that like yes the fact that goblin slayer is murdering them like yes it
01:17:53 like it's against that it's showing in that way but they would also argue that like it is also true
01:17:59 that the show is kind maybe even covertly or maybe maybe they'd say it's like unconscious like patriarchal
01:18:06 you know uh uh whatever stuff coming out that it is also kind of sexualizing and glorifying it in
01:18:12 you know these ways sexualized like we there weren't any sort of specific shots that i could
01:18:18 really point to that we're like that's the funny thing though it in the anime because the anime
01:18:22 is different from the manga the manga is more explicit but in the anime like you we don't see
01:18:27 actual rape happening on screen though it's it's implied to be happening and going on you know
01:18:31 but like we do see a girl get her clothes ripped off and she is an anime girl which means that she's
01:18:39 pretty attractive so like how does one how does one negotiate this to like make it clear what's
01:18:46 happening but not to titillate the audience yeah i don't know make her attractive i guess make them
01:18:52 ugly or yeah unattractive or i i guess you could like not show her body as much if you like kind
01:18:58 of show that like clothes are being ripped off but you don't show her on screen i don't even think
01:19:02 that would matter i think it's the idea itself has to be purged yeah i feel i feel like even if the
01:19:11 author had made all the steps to make it as least attractive as possible people would still have a
01:19:16 cow about the scene existing like it could have just been like the goblin slayer showing up and
01:19:21 someone ran up to him some ran in just like my wife was raped by goblins and that would be bad enough
01:19:26 yeah i suppose that's true like if the show if the show was exactly the same but we we just didn't
01:19:33 even address the whole goblin rape question and we just showed goblins murdering people
01:19:37 i don't think anyone would complain i think there would be no complaints which is i mean yeah people
01:19:43 just get fucked up about this stuff yeah like i said like we have stuff like attack on titan have
01:19:47 you guys seen attack on titan yeah like nobody complains about the violence and attack on titan
01:19:51 even though it's it's horrific and yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's just weird it's it's a weird it's a
01:19:57 weird thing as a culture we just get really fucked up about like sexual stuff yeah basically my
01:20:03 my stance was four episodes in uh minus that whole controversy non-traverse nonsense it's an
01:20:10 interesting show i like it it's like i'm a huge fan of the manga so i am i am like um i'm a really
01:20:17 big fan of like fantasy sort of rpg sort of things and you know it's set in that sort of world
01:20:23 where like they have a guild they have like a like a system with low levels and and they take on
01:20:28 quests and there's magic and it's like it's all the things i like but it's also it's also a very
01:20:33 gritty sort of depiction of it and that's what i find interesting that's kind of the point that's
01:20:40 kind of the point i'm gonna predict something uh actually most likely no one will ever care about
01:20:46 goblin slayer as much again and like i doubt like just because people care about stuff that's new
01:20:51 they don't really care about stuff that's old but i'm just gonna like if we continue the same
01:20:55 train of logic of objecting to this stuff later on in the series um there is a character called the
01:21:00 sword maiden who is like she's like a legendary warrior and she's a total badass and she's extremely
01:21:06 like curvaceous and like sexualized and stuff and like that that's fine i don't think people would
01:21:11 really complain about that but the thing is canonically she was a rape victim of goblins and
01:21:18 it's like like way in her past this happened to her it was only after that that she like
01:21:23 got strong and like became like a badass sword maiden and then like defeated the evils of the
01:21:27 world and stuff but she's still kind of fucked up about goblins the thing is though like i don't
01:21:33 know i feel like the thing is you can choose to find a fence with anything so like here's a thought
01:21:39 maybe uh like rape victims will be offended by this character because like oh yeah she just
01:21:45 got over her trauma look at them trivializing rape victims here like but the thing and then on the
01:21:50 other hand this character still has flashbacks to this event so like she isn't completely over it
01:21:57 somebody else might say oh look at us they're telling us that we can never get over our trauma
01:22:01 like what a problem at there's no way to win with the topic yeah yeah yeah i don't know what the
01:22:09 answer is i the answer is freedom as far as i'm right no like it's libertarian mind your fucking
01:22:15 own business and relax it's the idea of like these because like people who are this bent out of shape
01:22:21 about it are just gonna say the only answer is like this stuff is off limits it cannot be talked about
01:22:27 cannot be done but take it seriously basically basically if you were if you felt uncomfortable
01:22:32 by a good good good job that's what they were trying to do i think yeah it's just a question of
01:22:39 people maybe don't like to feel discomfort or something i mean i i don't know like i the thing
01:22:45 i think people's outrage makes sense if they have a worldview that i don't think makes sense so like
01:22:53 right well that's that's the whole problem with discussion nowadays anyways there's yeah like
01:22:58 the baseline is different so like yeah that's right that's we're not even having the same
01:23:03 conversation as like the people we're talking about would be happy so it's like it's impossible to come
01:23:07 to terms yeah i'm not saying you you know you're supposed to like it or whatever like you definitely
01:23:11 don't have it was not meant to be liked the scene but like come to terms with the fact that the
01:23:18 scene exists for a reason and the reason is not to titillate people it's just i mean so don't be
01:23:26 outraged about people we're connecting the goblins to the jews and we're just like throwing out
01:23:31 that whole business really you guys didn't hear i mean i mean you know i guess i won't drop any
01:23:37 names but there are some videos out there that specifically said like hmm big nose little vermin
01:23:43 that this guy wants to literally genocide and wipe out where have i heard of that before and it's
01:23:48 just like guys you need to relax there are no connections here oh my god noses oh my god
01:23:56 that all that kind of says more about the people who are looking into it yeah i said a million times
01:24:01 but still iran it reminds me of that whole apu controversy oh my god and you hear he's gone
01:24:06 you hear that he's gone yeah yeah i love i love how there's this amazing brain dump that came out
01:24:11 like a week before that just like totally clean the clock of this whole thing is like yeah of
01:24:16 course this is ridiculous and like a week later like and it's gone it's just where does this logic
01:24:22 end because now now they're saying that minorities need to be displayed within a very narrow parameters
01:24:30 that are of what's acceptable and like who exactly is the arbiter of what's acceptable and what's not
01:24:36 because at this point is a well-developed and rich character and but now because he has i guess roots
01:24:44 in like his accent and the fact that he's voiced by a white guy uh we're just opening the door here
01:24:50 and uh opening the floodgates to let like people pulley this is i don't know man i just don't
01:24:57 think this is the right direction for the people to be going with this kind of stuff it's tiring
01:25:03 feels very wrong okay i'm tired i'm tired yeah okay you know what i want to go lay down and
01:25:09 forget about humanity for a while well hang on before we do that we've got a couple of voicemails
01:25:13 to listen to oh yeah okay please cheer us up let's all right let's go to it we've i think we've got

01:27:31 patreon just to get any more content seriously fucking help help me i was gonna die all right
01:27:39 that's enough from this friend i was gonna say uh five dollars to the patreon to get all those
01:27:43 sweet bonus episodes of which there's 19 now there's at least one bonus episode coming that you
01:27:48 haven't heard yet friend if you're listening to this um so that's so so do that uh it's true
01:27:56 these are all true the content is slowing down a little bit um for me it's because i'm working on
01:28:02 like bigger more complicated projects and i want to do we aga with stuff more but i just don't have
01:28:08 the fucking time to get everything done i need to get done every week basically now he's right
01:28:12 but i'm working on it uh what's your excuse everybody else Nate you just gotta stop skateboarding
01:28:18 so much i won't i need to get that pokemon go stop every day dammit all right question why don't
01:28:24 you just do a we agua while you're skateboarding just record get a laugh mic and just talk about
01:28:28 something while you're skateboarding just you know all the time there's there's something to be said
01:28:33 that i've kind of fallen into a trap with we agua where like the the point of the series was to get
01:28:39 a video done every week about something and like to make it cool like make it good you know
01:28:47 reasonably speaking but the most important thing was just to get a video out every week
01:28:51 at the time i took the format you failed well i did for a while a good long while like i was doing
01:28:56 it well um currently it's not living up to its name which is fair uh but um like i just styled
01:29:03 it after the mea math of a content that i was doing and just kept doing that and i've still
01:29:06 been doing that i've sort of fallen into a trap where i'm just like now i feel i'm forced to live
01:29:11 up to like a certain standard where the the like quality is kind of creeping up like the last ones
01:29:15 i was like in hawaii for uh uh and well the one after that i wasn't yeah i i need to get them done
01:29:24 i think your your your old habits are creeping back in i think the whole point of we agua was
01:29:29 you wanted to get it done first and the quality the quality wasn't like not that the quality is not
01:29:34 important but like i think you're you're obsessing over the uh intimate details that aren't necessary
01:29:39 i think you should just go back make weekly do what you can in a week and people will be fine
01:29:45 with it and you just need to break your own conditioning it's like sugar you're you're
01:29:49 you're addicted to video sugar get off that shit protein there's definitely something to be said for
01:29:55 that uh and i should seriously consider that stuff right now i'm not even thinking about it because
01:30:01 i'm doing something else but once this current thing is done i will have to think seriously about
01:30:05 that there might not be one till the end of the year depending on how things go my god i i know i
01:30:11 know it's disgraceful but why i'm a genius yearly all right new series i'm working on it people
01:30:17 all right that's enough about this shit i'll get back to you we'll get back i'm still doing stuff
01:30:20 every week devlogs every week after you're into devtober work on the game uh it's going to keep
01:30:25 going uh this is my life now i'm probably gonna do lots more uh i'm getting back into doing more
01:30:30 3d modeling stuff once this uh this demo slash alpha slash whatever ends up being is out because
01:30:36 i want to be out by the end of the month will it be out now as people are listening uh i don't
01:30:40 think so my plan is to have something public facing out on november 8th because that's when
01:30:44 i turn 30 i want to have some cool out i need i need something to like to uh to to to to take
01:30:50 off the sting of yeah yeah that's what this is it's actually a really good goal i like that a lot
01:30:56 i should do something similar when i turn 30 it'll be two years people two years god just that's
01:31:01 cool how about you mage what's your excuse where's your content it's a very long excuse i don't want
01:31:05 to get into it uh okay fair enough there's a lot of a lot of small things they're just kind of piled
01:31:11 up together basically if you want to get us to make more content the easiest ways to give us more
01:31:16 time the best way to have more times to have more money i'm just saying that's true that's for you
01:31:21 guys that's for you guys for me it didn't didn't matter how much money you threw at mage mage i'm
01:31:25 trying to help you out here i'm trying to give you free money no just lie to the mage just lie to
01:31:29 them that's the answer i feel bad i feel bad mage needs more convincing the way to get more
01:31:33 convincing is give me more time to convince her way to give me more time to give me the money you
01:31:38 want to give her you ain't wrong brother all right now let's go to our next one here one spars
01:31:44 back with another message all right one spar hit us hit us boy hey guys just uh here at home walking
01:31:51 around sipping some coffee this morning and uh i think i came up with a uh pretty good idea for
01:31:58 a new pcp intro um give it a listen tell me what you think somebody once told me the world was
01:32:15 i've heard enough that's enough thank you one spark uh you're fired
01:32:22 i think there was actually something at the end of that underlying do you think there's an
01:32:25 underlying message here that the new pcp theme has a strong undercurrent of detractors you know
01:32:30 there's something going on with that maybe we should i don't know revisit this issue i'm always
01:32:35 open to revisiting stuff and why did you guys vote for it like you know offense to the person who made
01:32:40 it it was good but like you made everybody liked it no not everybody not everybody sasuke pro may
01:32:50 just talk in mad shit on you right now please send her a scathing email about how she's bullying
01:32:56 you online i'm not i just didn't like a thing as much as you guys did well fair enough fair enough
01:33:04 um and actually you'll see him in the comments every once in a while being like yeah thank god
01:33:08 you shortened it today i fucking hate my own song yeah yeah so i mean if you that was gonna be the
01:33:15 case you probably should uh thought about that before you decide to make an intro of a podcast
01:33:18 100 plus episodes deep i mean it frankly it's our fault not his i guess you know if it is truly
01:33:24 shit well whatever um all right here we go this does blame to go around okay here we go next one's
01:33:30 from i really mean it is another message all right do it members of the pcb hear me now as i whisper
01:33:41 to you in divine doubt you will all look yourselves in the mirror and decide who you want to be today
01:33:49 tomorrow and when you are no longer here we all have a legacy and i'll have fever dreams about you
01:33:59 guys when i am in the retirement home
01:34:04 oh was he playing the xylophone while he recorded that maybe i don't i don't i don't want to look at
01:34:11 the mirror though oh ouch i don't like i don't like the person that stares back at me oh christ damn
01:34:18 that's uh that's serious that's like the opposite of what that message is about it's about becoming
01:34:22 your best self mage for me it's like for me it's like that clip of uh of that movie sure what was
01:34:28 that show like time warp time leap or something where the guy is like am i retarded and then he
01:34:32 looks in the mirror and then like he's in like a down syndrome guy's body um that's me so i avoid
01:34:38 looking in the mirror is what quantum leap was it quantum it was quantum leap that's the one that's
01:34:43 the one mage i got a fix for you by the way quick fix for the mirror uh painted purple that's that's
01:34:48 a good idea let's put a put a purple filter over it yeah uh is that is that a physical thing mage
01:34:53 or is that like an emotional thing like both okay well that's sad uh i'd say work on that in some way
01:35:02 if possible please i am i am i i i make peace with my loathing of myself well that's always good to
01:35:09 hear uh all right next making peace is step one step two is declaring a war on it and crushing it
01:35:15 entirely i'll i'll i'll hit it when it doesn't see it exactly you know i actually do think about uh
01:35:22 his points fairly frequently like when i look back like will i look back on like for example we
01:35:27 aga was with much love some of them a bit some of them not as much like what i'll what i i mean
01:35:33 you know what's my best work you know like the for me i think my best work is like the gurren
01:35:38 login videos i really like my final fantasy 15 uh what is it unchained unflamed whatever it was
01:35:45 i love that video um i don't know some of the some of the oh the the musical stuff like the
01:35:51 smash bros stuff i really love uh i don't know so like so like yeah i do think about like what do i
01:35:57 want to like have my legacy be in terms of like youtube and then also like what's the point of
01:36:02 the content overall like entertainment is good and that's a valuable service but i mean whatever
01:36:09 i've talked about this a bunch you know i i'd like to think that i'm making a positive difference
01:36:13 in the world and not just you know being i mean my whole goal right now and the reason i stopped
01:36:20 doing youtube pretty much entirely is because i was just like well the only thing i care about
01:36:24 is like am i going to be satisfied when i'm dying that what i did in my life was worth it
01:36:28 yeah and youtube was not the answer so i was like well i won't make as much money and i by not shilling
01:36:35 on youtube but fuck it the money is not going to make me happy when i'm fucking dying of cancer
01:36:40 from cell phone radiation exposure at 45 it's like we're all gonna die that way it's a bouncing act
01:36:46 because like i mean for me i'm i'm currently sacrificing large amounts of my time to work at
01:36:51 my day job programming um which is fine but none of it is really adding to much of a legacy that i
01:36:58 value particularly much but i i'm i'm basically sacrificing that time to obtain the money that
01:37:04 i feel will allow me to springboard into you know doing that stuff more and building something that
01:37:10 i value and i'm glad that i worked on and stuff so i don't know like there's a balancing act i guess
01:37:17 you don't want to like literally die and then you like because if you literally die making your art
01:37:22 then well then you won't get as much made and so that might be less but on the other side if you
01:37:27 if you spend too long working on your normie job or whatever and you save a bunch of money and then
01:37:31 you switch then like maybe you've wasted too much of your life you know if you've done that and you
01:37:36 you're coming out below what you would have if you'd just done it say uh it's a struggle for sure
01:37:40 yeah well i'll also you know thought about such things but i'm sort of like like i said i'm sort
01:37:46 of at peace with the idea of like um i don't regret my life up till this point even though i feel
01:37:52 like i wasted a lot of it though you know defined wasted i'm happy with what i've done in a way but
01:37:58 at the same time i know that i'm just another drop in the ocean i'm not gonna break any new grounds
01:38:04 or there's not going to be much left of me once i leave this place so we kind of not with that
01:38:08 attitude mage come on but i'm okay with that i mean not everyone is born to be a name in the
01:38:14 history books you know take take for example like look at like toby fox for example so sure
01:38:20 right now undertale is a huge meme um like it's a good game everybody likes it um and you know
01:38:27 whatever and it's a meme so people talk about it a lot will undertale make much difference in the
01:38:33 long run of like humanity you know will it because like it's pretty almost objective that like
01:38:40 undertale for example is like more influential than like all of us so like okay fair enough
01:38:45 but even something like undertale like it's just a game right so like will it it was it
01:38:51 has been given as a present to the pope so right so it cured world peace finally was solved uh we
01:38:57 did it no i think undertale it does like you know we i think i think it has staying potential it's
01:39:04 definitely going to be remembered in many years by a lot of people and who knows when it's relative
01:39:10 i guess yeah like when the heat death of the universe happens like literally nothing will
01:39:14 remain so you know except undertale except undertale except undertale yeah him and the
01:39:20 pope will be floating out in space with this copy of undertale the heat death of the universe is
01:39:24 sans it is sans yeah it's a heavy topic it's a heavy topic i don't know just try i say i say
01:39:33 try to make the world around you a better place don't be a burden on the people
01:39:38 that you know or that you care about be be of benefit to them and there's lots of ways to be
01:39:42 of benefit not strictly financial there's lots of ways to do it so as long as you feel that you're
01:39:47 contributing and that you're making the world better around you than it was when you get there
01:39:52 as opposed to worse neutral is okay but you want to be a plus then let's go yeah yeah okay let's go
01:40:00 on to the next one this is from uh from a rupt rupt so much so much for making us happier
01:40:08 okay so bullying bullying do you guys ever get bullied in high school middle school or
01:40:13 shit like that and like i'm not trying to be repetitive because you guys probably got a lot
01:40:19 of this question on twitter um back the day but it's just that i don't understand how bully
01:40:25 works because just fucking fight the guy okay like fighting a bully is exactly a win-win situation
01:40:36 because either the guy can lose to you or you you can be seen as a hero who fought a fucking bully
01:40:45 and like people will like you because people don't like bullies in general it's just a question
01:40:49 just a question like i don't understand how bully works it's probably because it's a us problem
01:40:54 at a i live in south america but it's just a fucking question but i love you guys i'm not in the us
01:40:59 but okay that's true well okay i can i can answer this question yeah the people the people who are
01:41:04 targeted by bullies by people especially in the west they're targeted because they're pussies
01:41:10 and they're not gonna fight back yes that's true that that cut out for me i didn't hear
01:41:16 they're targeted what uh the people who get targeted by bullies they get targeted because
01:41:21 they're pussies and they won't fight back for the most part yeah i can tell you my story with bullying
01:41:28 there was a there was a girl i think she was my age i'm not sure she got on my case for who knows
01:41:33 what i really really no reason at all uh but and she was smaller than me so you think you think i'd
01:41:40 have no problem however the problem with her was she was never alone she was always with guys like
01:41:46 let's say i was 14 and she was 14 and she was with guys 19 years old way bigger than me at least
01:41:52 two of them at at each side with her at no point was i able to sort of fight her back and even
01:41:58 actually i did fight her back and um she she need me in the forehead with her knee
01:42:07 and it is it wasn't just physical you know and it was also psychological she psychologically
01:42:14 tormented me and the fact that she wasn't in school or in my neighborhood i could never
01:42:18 see her coming i didn't know when i'm gonna meet her but she was never alone and whenever i did
01:42:23 it was never in a public place where people could help me it was it was it was it was mortifying
01:42:29 it was just like i felt i never felt so helpless when i was in my life she's sort of like i think
01:42:36 she was kind of like what broke the you know uh jokingly why i left violence streak in a way
01:42:41 sure sure did you i mean uh i'm just curious did you like talk to like your parents or like
01:42:46 school people or anything like that school people are irrelevant she wasn't in my school
01:42:51 i did talk to my mom once or twice i told her about it um and you know my mom tried to help and
01:43:00 we actually went one time she you know saw the bruise on my forehead so she went we went out and
01:43:05 tried to find her and uh she she we did find her and uh she she talked to her and she was giving
01:43:14 my mom such a you know shitty eating grin that my mom um couldn't help herself and smacked her
01:43:18 across the face but because of that we weren't able to go to the police because my mom would get
01:43:26 in trouble for hitting a minor god all right she kind of blew it by doing that because it would
01:43:30 have been good to go to the police the violent violence runs in the family holy shit uh the next
01:43:36 time i think the last time i saw her was during camp not the not the same year as you know the
01:43:41 whole incident with the arms things uh but that was i should have dropped her off at sue story
01:43:46 i almost ended up in the same um building as her but thankfully we didn't so for the the whole week
01:43:53 my my mission was to avoid her at all costs to let her know that i was there but for the last
01:43:58 i think two days i blew it or rather it wasn't my fault it was it was my counselors of the house
01:44:04 fault because he was he was he was like he was almost i he was a helper so i think he was a teenager
01:44:12 almost an adult young adult person and there was some for lack of a better word skanks in my house
01:44:19 literally sucking up to him probably sucking up to him lads he yeah so he was very much on their
01:44:26 side and they were friends with that girl so i had no chance women's sexual uh uh advantages
01:44:33 can definitely be weaponized in situations like this it's a unique advantage uh like if a guy comes
01:44:40 to you and has an issue and a girl disagrees and she'll fuck you i'm just saying i'm just saying
01:44:45 you who are you gonna who are you gonna go with i did i did complain to the higher ups at the camp
01:44:51 and the and the person i complained to she was in charge of our house and uh uh she she said she
01:44:58 lived in the same neighborhood as the girl and she was like oh but you know she she she never
01:45:02 seemed like she was trouble and like but she is and yeah they couldn't really help two faced
01:45:09 bitch yeah the basically it just sounds like like to to the guy's question it's just like
01:45:16 there they they find people who can't defend themselves in this way uh yeah like they specifically
01:45:23 target people who seem vulnerable because if they yeah like if you're if you're a real bully
01:45:28 like if you find someone who gives you resistance you don't bully them you bully someone else
01:45:33 exactly yeah and i don't like i guess i see his point i guess like just i mean i got bullied in
01:45:39 high school all the time because i was a pathetic little bitch and uh yeah and it was not cool yeah
01:45:45 it's not like it's totally my fault i blame myself the bullies in the movies and children's cartoons
01:45:51 whatnot that they were the portrayed it looks so easy that all you have to do is stand up to them
01:45:55 and be top dog and stuff like that but it doesn't work out like that even if you beat them today
01:46:00 then you have to beat them the next day and the thing about a bully a bully is inherently
01:46:05 immoral with what they're doing so like if you like beat up a bully they will go play the victim
01:46:11 and then you have become the aggressor or or or they'll get their friends to help beat you up
01:46:17 the next time it's not going to be a fair fight next time i mean yeah that that's definitely true
01:46:22 i was never i don't know i lived a pretty coddled childhood and i was never really bullied um but
01:46:27 there was there was one time i had a pogo stick beating crap out of ben oh well yeah i was the bully
01:46:33 and that's taking him he loved it though um there was uh there was one time in uh uh element no
01:46:40 middle school like sixth grade or something when um in uh i was i had a pogo stick for some reason
01:46:46 i was pogo sticking in class when i shouldn't have been just for fun why this guy uh uh just
01:46:53 he he i stop he looks over me and he just calls me he's he i think he's white i could be wrong
01:46:59 he just calls me n-i-g-g-e-r he just calls me that and i'm just like uh what what okay what do you
01:47:06 mean sir what what's that about and uh i didn't understand i knew what the word meant at that
01:47:11 point but i didn't know what that was about but that was the extent of it he just called me that
01:47:16 and then moved on i didn't get like harassed i didn't get like physically assaulted or anything
01:47:21 of that nature so i had a pretty it was pretty lucky it's pretty lucky i feel like his he'd heard
01:47:26 his dad say that word it's like i want to try this out in real life yeah probably something like that
01:47:31 i think he was white like i i i don't know he had slightly tanned his skin it's probably like
01:47:35 armenian or something i don't know um yeah so that's that's it for me i guess yeah all right i
01:47:43 guess we'll just go on to the next fucking call here oh uh did i already play this one yeah that
01:47:49 was erupt okay next one is uh vacuum vacuum all right we've got two more here all right let's uh
01:47:56 let's get this shit rolling so nate recommended this book called the 48 laws of power it's a
01:48:02 fucking sick read really uh really fun to read super inspiring also no one else is allowed to
01:48:09 read it uh this book is cut off from the public now if anyone tries to read it i will fuchsia your
01:48:17 if you know what i'm saying uh i take offense to this voicemail because i'm the one who
01:48:22 recommended the 48 laws of power because i was reading it and it's fucking great i i think he
01:48:26 like i did meme like i quoted a sam hide joke about the 48 laws of power i have not actually read
01:48:33 the book though i would like to i've heard it uh i mean it's fantastic yeah yeah uh it's good but
01:48:39 you know but speaking of power just you probably are aware of this but it was interesting tom that
01:48:43 with that bullying thing you said that you blamed yourself um for getting bullied and like
01:48:49 like i i get what you're saying i get what you're saying and and surely you're aware that like
01:48:54 like if someone murders you because you're i don't know like walking out late in a bad neighborhood
01:49:00 like sure you can blame yourself but but like the the the bad person is more so the the other person
01:49:07 so it's like it's it's it's it's smart to take responsibility for the bad things to happen because
01:49:13 only you can change your own behavior but of course like morally speaking uh it's it's the
01:49:19 aggressor yeah morally but i yeah there's an extent of what you can do my situations the
01:49:25 situations i was in were were definitely exasperated by my own uh naivete and general idiocy so there
01:49:33 was there was a fair bit of my own stupidity that made a lot of these things happen i think it
01:49:40 reminds me of like there was there was i don't i don't i sort of disagree with i mean like sort of
01:49:46 like there's an extent of responsibility you can take but also you can't take all of the
01:49:51 responsibility for instance with the with my bully that storm entity throughout the years whatever
01:49:56 yeah like all i did was talk to her once and it was it was because i took some advice about
01:50:01 someone saying oh you made you know you should stand up to yourself more because you're so meek
01:50:07 and i did i took that stupid advice i i and you know i think what happened is like i never knew
01:50:12 her we never saw each other before and she had the goal to sort of call after me and be like hey
01:50:17 you have stupid shoes or something like that and i snapped something back at her and that's what
01:50:22 started it and now because of that because of that did i deserve all that did i deserve all of that
01:50:27 torment she gave me well i don't think so like in the Machiavellian sense like i'm sure there were
01:50:34 tactical moves that one could make to theoretically like resolve the situation and i would i would
01:50:39 never say morally you're responsible it's just that you know like maybe there were things that
01:50:45 could be done that if you had known about maybe if you like literally had a future site you could
01:50:48 know what would work and what wouldn't um and so like you know like in the grand scheme of like
01:50:53 the cause and effect of one's entire life like yes you are quote unquote responsible for what
01:50:58 happens just like like sure like a kid who's born like in the poorest fucking region of Africa
01:51:04 and stars to death like okay maybe there's something he could have done to like get him out of that if
01:51:10 you know whatever he had like known what to do at certain times but like no one would ever blame
01:51:14 the kid for like you know what what happened to him or anything it's kind of a yeah i don't know
01:51:20 where where it's not whatever you get the point you get the point so i mean yeah like there's
01:51:26 there's this book that i haven't read but i've been hearing more about in case you nice dad made a
01:51:30 video about the author recently um what's called i think it's extreme responsibility or no extreme
01:51:36 ownership i think is what it's called it's just about like completely owning uh it's kind of more
01:51:41 for like leaders in life like owning your subordinates mistakes and stuff and taking complete responsibility
01:51:45 for everything happens to you there's a i believe in that philosophy a lot in thinking like i'm always
01:51:51 saying like nobody gives a fuck about you in this world it's up to you to make it or to die in the
01:51:56 streets and that that's because like tactically speaking it's up to you to manage your life 100
01:52:03 percent like nobody else is going to do it uh and you cannot expect help um but but but there's a
01:52:10 separate thing to like condemn bad actors like the world shouldn't be bad and full of like
01:52:16 evil people who do bad things but those people have their own motivations you can't control them
01:52:20 you can only control yourself so it's just about assessing the reality while recognizing that things
01:52:26 are bad and you can do both those things at once i think so i don't know i think we all agree i'm
01:52:31 probably just going in circles here anyway yeah anyway that wasn't really that guy's question
01:52:37 what is vacuum mask again he was asking about like he was just mentioning a book he liked the
01:52:42 book no one else 48 laws of power right 48 laws of power that's right no one else is allowed to
01:52:47 read it yeah i mean the more people that read it the less effective the book does become it's true
01:52:52 is that true yeah because like it's about it's all about manipulating people that's the 48 laws of
01:52:57 power all about i believe in uh uh what's the word uh ethical manipulation of other people
01:53:04 the first the introduction of this book is that ethics are bullshit throw away morality okay well
01:53:09 you know so i i hear what he's saying but my my my compass guides me towards a better future for
01:53:18 all people all right which i 48 laws will work on you good to know for the future you know that's
01:53:25 that is kind of fascinating how does one how does one read this book and get to that first
01:53:30 lesson about like discard morality like like uh Machiavelli uh and the prince uh or i think it's
01:53:37 i think it is like another transaction whatever people know it as the prince the prince is about
01:53:41 like it's not saying it discard morality it's saying i think play the tactical game
01:53:47 outside of what says to it's the same thing it's like it's amoral you just have to apply it
01:53:52 as best you can like i don't think about it in terms of moral i don't think you can like that
01:53:57 makes you immoral to follow its advice or anything it's about what you do with it i'd say you have
01:54:02 to like disregard because like a lot of it if you read the book with a moral lens yeah everything in
01:54:07 it is like reprehensible but if you read it it's just like this these are tactics in like the game
01:54:12 that we're all playing whether we want to or not it's a strategy guy i was gonna say because in in
01:54:17 regards to the prince it's specifically made for like for like uh like up and coming rulers and
01:54:22 like people who expect to like control you know populations and stuff and like the thing is it's
01:54:28 literally impossible to be like perfectly moral when you're a ruler because every move you make
01:54:34 will help some people and will like sort of punish other people like for example if you're a dictator
01:54:39 of the world right now like what do you do about the coal industry and the fact that we're losing
01:54:44 coal jobs those coal workers are suffering but like we kind of don't we kind of want to get
01:54:48 away from coal so like what's the solution uh like i i guess the solution is like retrain those
01:54:55 people in jobs that like they you know can do that is for like a more you know green economically
01:55:01 sustainable pathway for it but like what about the people who don't want to stop doing coal and
01:55:06 they just won't like what do you do that the answer is nothing some people get fucked is the answer
01:55:12 i mean that is the ethic i think that's the ethical thing if like you're if your business goes away
01:55:17 yeah and you refuse to stop doing it uh then perish uh tinted obama image like like that's
01:55:23 yeah that's just like like you're an idiot you know uh i mean you're right like that's what's
01:55:29 going to happen in the real world so like you could you could choose to live idealistically
01:55:34 or you could think about what are the optimal ways to live your life and you know strategize
01:55:39 for them and i'm aware that like a lot of like like oh coal's going away just get another job
01:55:45 but like where that runs into conflict is like you got people who are like man
01:55:49 my daddy's been a coal miner and his daddy and his daddy this is why i was born to do
01:55:53 i'm a human man like humans to some degree are built to settle down doing something you know
01:55:57 once they hit a certain age and stuff it's it's pretty fucked up to ask people just to change
01:56:02 their whole life at a certain point and a lot of people i think can't handle it understandably
01:56:06 you just have to you know there's no getting around it like yeah sorry you know life ain't
01:56:14 fair that's really what it comes down to yeah it's not all right we got one more one more fucking
01:56:21 message from uh it's from drunk nard war let's see what he has for us nard war i enjoy your interviews
01:56:29 what's what what's up hey christmas guys oh i just wanted to say you guys are the fucking coolest
01:56:39 hey thanks really kind of fucking gay actually
01:56:48 what it's doing right this is the best friendship simulator man could ask for
01:56:53 i don't get out much i don't have no friends but where i'm listening to the procrastinators
01:57:00 podcast i feel like i have friends i feel like i feel like a real real boy i feel like
01:57:10 uh
01:57:20 where's he going with this i think i understand why he doesn't have friends yeah i'm walking in the
01:57:28 do do nard war i get it uh wow amazing that was an interesting call
01:57:36 and that's pretty intense it makes me it makes me think about the ethics of making a friendship
01:57:44 simulator such as this podcast uh like because let's say this podcast didn't exist and no podcast
01:57:50 existed and this man had like he didn't have i don't know like video games didn't have tv didn't
01:57:57 have podcast didn't have anything and he just sat there lonely i wonder if he'd be more motivated
01:58:02 to go like make friends and so we're kind of doing a disservice you know you know what i mean
01:58:07 where we're doing in the pursuit of power one of 48 loves power there you go tom it's not
01:58:13 not even exaggerating one of the laws of power they talk about is uh to to to psychologically
01:58:18 manipulate people is to find what people are missing in their lives and become it and that is
01:58:23 what we are doing that okay see that makes sense and that's fair um but again one can do that in
01:58:30 ethical or a non-ethical way i think like there are some standards one can arrive at like our
01:58:35 podcast and moral because they're making the world a worse place because people are less incentivized
01:58:39 to go out and make real human connections and make friendships which will be infinitely more
01:58:43 rewarding than listening to a podcast um like sure it's profitable for us but then again how
01:58:48 much of the responsibility is on us i think is a fair question to ask well i was watching a video
01:58:52 last night they just randomly came on i was watching one of my vlogs make sure and uploaded
01:58:56 correctly and then autoplay immediately went to this other video that was talking about uh
01:59:00 morality and what can be a moral question and the two conditions he was talking about in the
01:59:05 video was that it has to be a conscious act and it has to have a uh a impact on someone's like
01:59:15 not that standard of living but like uh something that does like with people's happiness like very
01:59:20 rude of something okay and i would say podcasts do have an effect on people's happiness uh but
01:59:27 the effect you're talking about of like making people less like interested in going out and
01:59:33 finding friends is not a conscious act so i don't think this would be a moral thing i think it would
01:59:37 just be an amoral effect of podcasts in general because no one no one's making a podcast is actively
01:59:43 being like i'm going to stop you from having friends okay you know what that that's true maybe
01:59:48 immoral is the wrong word but it is fair to ask is it detrimental to society that is probably
01:59:53 makes questions i guess yeah i you know i guess i just want to say to drunk nard war
02:00:00 try to go like he said he has no friends okay fair enough fair enough what have you done recently
02:00:06 to work on that you know it's the same thing i'd say to a guy who's like sad that he doesn't have
02:00:09 a girlfriend or whatever like what have you done recently to fix it maybe you're trying really hard
02:00:14 in the past but like have you like here's a thing when i when i moved out to ohio i i just focused
02:00:20 on work for a long time but then after a while i'm like you know i would actually like to like
02:00:23 make some friends and connections and maybe fuck a bitch you know out here once in a while so what
02:00:28 i did for a while i i never did anything with this because like i i met michelle beforehand and i
02:00:33 don't know just that's haven't really needed to go out and do stuff since then um but like uh
02:00:39 i joined a bunch there's like there's it's like meetup.com or like meeting.com or something i think
02:00:43 it's meetup.com yeah it's just a website where you can like go to meetings and like it's just people
02:00:48 who go there they post about like clubs they have and they just accept you know people who want to
02:00:53 come hang out like why try that kind of shit you know i think it's totally worth it yeah if you if
02:00:59 you like don't have like a passion that like gets you up every morning and you're doing it and you
02:01:04 like and even if you do have a passion but it doesn't introduce you to other people i think people
02:01:08 have an inherent need to socialize kind of in person agreed uh so accept that reality about
02:01:14 yourself as a human being and and and coldly tactically attempt to resolve it uh it's like uh
02:01:21 yeah it's like it's like uh the great man uh Aaron Burr said in Hamilton i am the one thing
02:01:26 in life i can control and that it's true for all of us so go if you have problems you can't change
02:01:32 the world you can't change the conditions but you can change yourself in response to those conditions
02:01:36 indeed so become better yeah that's really all there is and i that's really the answer to all
02:01:42 these things it's just you know like on an individual level it's fair to say this to people
02:01:47 but what i what i just wonder is like on a large scale will these kind of messages actually make
02:01:52 the large difference and kind of make society happier and better i don't know i mean if everybody
02:01:58 on like maybe people are just society would change as well i mean yeah like that's the thing
02:02:03 every individual could could possibly do these things but on a mass scale the question is will
02:02:08 they and will it make the difference the problem i've always had with going out and meeting people
02:02:12 and i think i mentioned this on a tweet like last year and it still kind of holds true
02:02:16 is that the question i had posed was how do you meet people how am i supposed to meet people when
02:02:20 all the people i'd want to meet are staying in their house on their computer all day like i am
02:02:25 good question good because like you've got to ask yourself like if you do the meetup thing
02:02:30 like i uh one of the things i i wanted to join i know i've said this before but was a bunch of
02:02:34 like atheist like uh like meeting groups and stuff like the like the like the like the free
02:02:40 thinkers of ohio or something oh man those guys must be great i i well that that's the thing like
02:02:46 who do you think is at these things like who do you think is there who who knows the atheist
02:02:52 activists but but you know what i mean that's probably true but here's the thing here's the
02:02:57 thing like sure maybe everyone there is a nerd or maybe there's some actually cool people there
02:03:04 because i'll tell you this my anime club in college was mostly not great people i mean they
02:03:10 they were fine but they were not really great friends of mine i didn't really like yeah i agree
02:03:14 completely at like two of those anime club meetings like early on when i first started going i met
02:03:22 like my all my friends happened to be there because like these were people who have a passing interested
02:03:27 anime so they thought they would check it out this is in sophomore year of college i met them there
02:03:32 and we became buddies for life and so like it's not like i intersected with people who were like the
02:03:37 ideal people at anime club who were always there it's that it was an opportunity to meet like-minded
02:03:43 people and the way to succeed on these things is to take many opportunities because you know i don't
02:03:50 know maybe the fucking girl of your dreams gentlemen will be like at this fucking atheist
02:03:54 hardcore meetup because like maybe her friend dragged her there she's not really that interested
02:03:59 but she is there that one day and you gotta take that chance you gotta have lots you don't win if
02:04:05 you go to law of averages that's exactly it i was gonna say even you can lose any one hand of poker
02:04:11 but it's about about winning the war long term you give yourself the chances to to meet friends
02:04:16 and go do stuff so for the love of god get out there and try something it's so much better than
02:04:22 trying nothing and a lot of people probably have who are sad and sitting at home but i don't know
02:04:28 try to mix it up take some of these advice i will i will say that like i've said this a bunch of
02:04:31 times in a bunch of different situations for me the hardest part of anything is starting uh even
02:04:38 things that i like like the like every day when i want to work on my game or do art or even that
02:04:42 like things that like i feel are my sole reason for existing for drawing breath yeah it's still
02:04:48 for my mindset starting and getting that motion going is pain and it sucks and i don't want to
02:04:55 do it i'd rather just stay in bed and do nothing and be a piece of shit just because i'm a weak
02:05:00 flesh prison person and it's accepting that is the important first step yeah like there was an
02:05:06 interesting book uh called the five second rule by mel robbins i think it was a buy you don't have
02:05:13 to read the book because i can sum it up for you in literally like five seconds sick uh the idea is
02:05:17 that like she had stumbled across this idea of like if you if you're because like what happens is
02:05:21 that when you want to do something that's hard your brain instantly starts making excuses for you
02:05:26 to convince you you don't have to do it uh there's very rarely a time when you want to do something
02:05:30 and your brain will make excuses to do it because we're just all lazy by nature it sucks because
02:05:34 we don't want to expend energy because we're all fucking monkeys at the end of the day indeed so
02:05:38 the idea was that you count in your mind or count out loud backwards from five and once you get to
02:05:44 one you immediately physically move uh even if you do the task you need to do does not require
02:05:50 physical movement because the the act of counting breaks the mental state that you're in like making
02:05:55 excuses it forces your brain to stop thinking about those and do something else and then the
02:05:59 physical movement puts you into a different state yeah at that point you can start doing something
02:06:05 those things make a big that's a good idea that's a good strategy try that everybody try that when
02:06:09 it comes to these hard decisions uh you know that that that also works amazingly well and it's
02:06:13 instantly actionable it doesn't take any longer three two one and i'm moving yeah all right i uh uh
02:06:18 that remind uh in the extreme ownership thing like Casey Neistat in his interview with a guy who's
02:06:23 like a marine sergeant or something he asked him like what's one recommendation uh he said like
02:06:27 to succeed and like to get up and go and take ownership of your day because a lot of what he
02:06:31 talks about is like success not just like owning your mistakes though that they're hand in hand
02:06:36 it's like he's like it all starts with the first decision of the day and like when you fail on that
02:06:42 you are prepared to fail the rest of the day with like all the other challenges you face and you
02:06:46 like won't get you done but when you succeed at the first challenge of getting up and then you
02:06:50 succeed at the next challenge of i don't know making your coffee or having your healthy breakfast
02:06:55 or or working out or whatever like every success encourages you and feeds into the next one so to
02:07:02 succeed from right out of the gate in the morning helps him a lot and can feed into all this kind
02:07:07 of positive motion and uh and productivity and stuff so yeah uh it's a good idea i'm gonna try that
02:07:12 i'm gonna try that all right well with that that was the end of our fucking podcast i guess
02:07:18 everybody any any final thoughts mage what do you think about all this oh what and that's it everybody
