00:00:17 One, two, three, sync.
00:00:18 Hello, and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:24 It's Sunday, the 10?
00:00:28 No, it's Friday.
00:00:29 12.
00:00:30 I'm Ben Saint and Gibbontake is here.
00:00:34 I'm here.
00:00:35 That's true.
00:00:36 What's going on, Gibb?
00:00:39 Well...
00:00:40 What's been going on?
00:00:41 Well, you know, I've been looking up and looking down, and I just haven't seen anything really.
00:00:53 It's sort of like the week sort of flew by and nothing happened at all.
00:00:57 That is so relatable.
00:00:59 I, too, have had my head buried deep in the sand.
00:01:06 You know, Talbart.
00:01:09 Yeah.
00:01:11 I found his Twitter has another Twitter linked that I guess is the guy that runs it.
00:01:19 This guy, Peanards, and I guess he doesn't really tweet that much.
00:01:24 His last tweet was like a year ago.
00:01:26 All right, he tweets like, but he did a couple of funny tweets like a year ago, or no, it
00:01:31 was only like a month or two ago.
00:01:33 Never mind.
00:01:34 One of them was like, here, I'll just read it right now.
00:01:37 I was looking at them and they were really funny.
00:01:40 No, where was it?
00:01:43 No, where was it?
00:01:45 I can't find it.
00:01:46 Gibb, I'm just really sorry.
00:01:49 My bit failed.
00:01:51 Yet more mysteries.
00:01:52 Yet more drama.
00:01:55 The drama of the missing tweet.
00:01:57 No, it was a really funny tweet about like role playing as an ostrich and putting your
00:02:02 head in the ground.
00:02:04 No.
00:02:05 Hang on.
00:02:06 I'm going to hit at Peanard.
00:02:10 I'm going to use the Twitter search function ostrich.
00:02:15 Come on.
00:02:16 Here we go.
00:02:17 December 16th, 2022.
00:02:19 All you care about is your stupid ostrich role play bullshit.
00:02:23 I'm not listening.
00:02:24 I'm bent over.
00:02:25 My head buried in six inches of sand, completely dead by suffocation.
00:02:30 One retweet.
00:02:31 One retweet.
00:02:32 32 likes.
00:02:37 This is Talbart.
00:02:38 This is Talbart's material before he started chopping up Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan.
00:02:44 Well, I've been big mad this week, as you know.
00:02:51 I've been big mad this week about some stuff, about some old PCP stuff, and I'm cooled off
00:02:59 from it.
00:03:00 And I got to say, I was very unhelpful.
00:03:04 It was very pointless.
00:03:07 As usual, it was very pointless and foolish and maybe a little embarrassing to be big
00:03:15 mad on the internet.
00:03:17 It is.
00:03:18 And that's how it goes.
00:03:23 Do you want me to briefly summarize?
00:03:29 Well, it's a blood feud between you and Jesse over, I don't know.
00:03:39 Yeah.
00:03:40 Basically, okay, it boils down to basically nothing.
00:03:45 It was pretty much just me getting mad.
00:03:48 All right.
00:03:49 We were basically done with the Radcon stuff, right?
00:03:53 Everything was done.
00:03:54 Nate, I don't know if we've even said this on the show yet, but Nate actually finished
00:03:57 the OVA.
00:03:58 It's actually done, and we have it.
00:04:01 And it's uploaded, it's just not published yet.
00:04:04 We could literally be watching it right now.
00:04:07 So it was like, wow, we're done.
00:04:09 And then Jesse, at the very last minute, said, hey guys, I got to claim my gas costs.
00:04:15 I paid for gas to get there.
00:04:17 Reimbursed my gas.
00:04:18 Oh, oops, looks like I have to get my girlfriend to get a letter in the mail from her bank
00:04:27 to prove the cost of a hotel stay or something.
00:04:31 And that's going to be, it's going to be another business week before I can get that
00:04:35 to you.
00:04:36 Sorry.
00:04:37 And that, you know, it held it up for a week.
00:04:40 And you know, this did make me really mad, and I do think it's bullshit, but I did kind
00:04:48 of blow up and go ballistic and say, you're lying, there's no, it's all fake.
00:04:53 There are, this is just, this is just a time buying ploy.
00:04:56 This is, this is just a scheme.
00:04:59 This is a, this is a trick that you're pulling.
00:05:02 I did, I did say all that.
00:05:04 It turned out not to be true.
00:05:06 It turned out to be the case.
00:05:07 Yeah.
00:05:08 But you know what, I don't know.
00:05:15 I don't know.
00:05:16 No, you should have said, I wouldn't change a thing.
00:05:19 I wouldn't change a thing.
00:05:20 No, listen.
00:05:21 I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have missed it for the world or some stupid thing like
00:05:24 that.
00:05:25 Wouldn't have missed, the, the, the, I mean, listen, here's the thing, you know, yeah,
00:05:32 I guess it turned out that the receipts weren't fake, but you know, they could have been
00:05:37 and that's what's so scary.
00:05:38 That says a lot about society that it could, it could have been true.
00:05:43 I don't need to, to like you about it.
00:05:47 No.
00:05:48 You seem to understand that what you were doing was a bit silly, but like over the top.
00:05:53 Um, yeah.
00:05:55 In the end, there was nothing to be gained by complaining and definitely nothing to be
00:06:00 gained by, uh, um, throwing, throwing around out allegations.
00:06:08 So you know, whatever, uh, def, did I need to post about it on Twitter?
00:06:13 No, definitely didn't need to do that.
00:06:17 I forgot, I forgot one of Nate, Nate bought me, uh, I think I've mentioned that Nate bought
00:06:22 me George Washington's rules of etiquette.
00:06:25 It's a little red book that has like, it's kind of bullshit.
00:06:30 Actually, cause it's, it's not like he like swore by these rules.
00:06:34 It's just like when he was a kid, when he was like 14, he read a bunch of books about
00:06:39 etiquette and he just like took notes and he wrote down a bunch of rules in like a notebook.
00:06:44 And this is just like those notes that he wrote down.
00:06:47 So he didn't even come up with them.
00:06:50 But um, one of them is like, uh, what, what is it, speak, speak not of, um, speak not
00:07:01 evil of those who are not present for it is unjust.
00:07:05 And uh, you know, the thing about it is even if everything I said, I mean, okay, hang on.
00:07:14 Not to backpedal, but I didn't, I didn't, I didn't lie.
00:07:17 I didn't lie on Twitter.
00:07:18 I didn't, I know that what I was accusing Jesse of turned out not to be true, but I
00:07:22 didn't lie and make false allegations.
00:07:25 All I said was that, was that I was not beat was that, was that there was, there was whatever.
00:07:31 I mean, what you said implied that there was something happening and because people didn't,
00:07:35 people did not have the full context of the conversation.
00:07:38 They read your tweet and I was like, oh, I guess Jesse's the bad guy.
00:07:43 I guess Jesse is like, this is confirmed because you're, you're saying it.
00:07:47 Well, all right.
00:07:50 He wouldn't, he wouldn't, he wouldn't show me the proof.
00:07:52 He said he had proof.
00:07:52 He wouldn't show me the proof.
00:07:54 He did that not because he didn't have the proof.
00:07:56 He did that to make me mad.
00:07:58 And you know what?
00:07:59 It worked.
00:07:59 He got me.
00:08:00 He freaking got me.
00:08:02 I got mad on the internet.
00:08:03 Um, yep.
00:08:06 Anyway, anyway, uh, whatever.
00:08:10 But even, even, even if everything that I said he was doing turned out to be true,
00:08:17 it would still have been a pretty ugly look.
00:08:20 It's a pretty ugly look to go to Twitter about it.
00:08:23 So, you know, I don't know.
00:08:28 Sorry.
00:08:30 Uh, that's all, I guess that's all I have to say.
00:08:33 Did you apologize to Jesse?
00:08:35 No.
00:08:37 Could you do that?
00:08:39 No.
00:08:40 Come on.
00:08:41 No, no.
00:08:42 Do a little, do a little DM.
00:08:43 Do a little, I'm sorry.
00:08:45 I'm, I actually, I actually won't do that.
00:08:48 I actually will not do that.
00:08:53 Thanks for listening to the pro Christmas podcast, everybody.
00:08:56 Uh, I don't, I don't care what Jesse thinks.
00:09:01 I don't, I don't care if he's mad at me or, or if I was unjust.
00:09:05 I'm not, I'm not sorry for his sake.
00:09:07 I'm sorry for my sake.
00:09:10 And, uh, I guess anyone who, uh, was annoyed by me,
00:09:18 that's, yeah, that's it.
00:09:21 I don't, I don't like Jesse.
00:09:22 I have not liked Jesse for years.
00:09:24 I don't care if the bridge is burned a good riddance,
00:09:27 but that's not an excuse to be, to be a punk about it.
00:09:32 So, so that's what I have to say about that.
00:09:35 Um, anyway, just want to get out ahead of that
00:09:38 because there were a bunch of comments being like,
00:09:39 can't wait to hear Ben rage on the next podcast.
00:09:42 And then I'm over it.
00:09:43 I'm over my rage.
00:09:44 Sorry.
00:09:46 If you want to hear me rage, you can go and listen to my
00:09:49 ranting on a Twitch about it, uh, uh, the last couple of streams that I did,
00:09:55 which, um, my stream viewership is up by the way.
00:09:59 My streams were doing pretty well.
00:10:01 It might be, it might be, it might be because I've been ranting and raving about that lately,
00:10:08 or it might also be because I'm playing battle network
00:10:12 and the freaking battle network collection is coming out.
00:10:15 And I guess that's like in the news, it might be boosting my numbers as well.
00:10:21 The last stream I did was like,
00:10:23 it was at like the same viewership as like I used to get back in like 2019
00:10:27 when I was, uh, you know, when I had a little thing going.
00:10:31 So that was cool.
00:10:32 Yeah.
00:10:33 Be nice if that would keep up.
00:10:36 Guess we'll see.
00:10:37 It might be, might also be because I've been very regular about my schedule.
00:10:41 I've been keeping to the Monday, Friday evenings thing.
00:10:46 So people know where to find me.
00:10:49 That's pretty cool.
00:10:51 Uh, yeah, I guess that's pretty cool.
00:10:53 Yeah.
00:10:53 Do you think that's pretty cool?
00:10:54 Would you, would you, I think it's pretty neat.
00:10:58 I mixed out at 12 viewers last stream.
00:11:04 I was getting about like the, the first couple streams I did for a few weeks there,
00:11:12 I was getting maybe like 20.
00:11:14 I was maybe hitting like the mid 20s.
00:11:17 And then the last one I did, I was up at like, uh, I think I almost hit six.
00:11:21 And I think it did briefly hit 60.
00:11:23 I was like, sure, sure.
00:11:27 Nice.
00:11:29 I'm wondering if, if my streams, because I changed, uh, the timing people saying,
00:11:36 oh, it's too early to do a stream.
00:11:37 You've like, I appeared as soon as it was over.
00:11:40 So I did the stream later and I got exactly the same number of people,
00:11:44 but different people, something maybe.
00:11:47 So I guess Saturday is potentially not a good day to do it.
00:11:52 Or nobody cares about a little old cab or fire emblem.
00:12:01 I mean, I can't speak to what people think about fire emblem.
00:12:06 Saturday, I don't know.
00:12:08 Saturday evening seems just as good as Friday evening.
00:12:15 I actually was, I'm not really sure whether I think that like weekdays or weekends
00:12:21 are better.
00:12:22 I think different people watch Twitch on those two different kinds of days for different reasons.
00:12:28 Yeah.
00:12:29 Some people watch a stream because the job is boring and they don't need to work.
00:12:34 Yeah.
00:12:35 So they're just like, ah, fuck it.
00:12:37 I'm just sitting there.
00:12:39 I think a bunch of people have told me like, yeah, I'm watching this at work.
00:12:42 Like, yeah, this is, this is getting me through the work day or whatever.
00:12:45 Maybe I could move it into some part of the week.
00:12:50 I don't know, the viewers aren't at the point, but it's nice to get viewers.
00:12:57 Are you streaming, do you do it once a week?
00:12:58 Just once, yeah.
00:13:01 Yeah.
00:13:03 I think I used to do it once a week, back in 2019 or so.
00:13:08 And I think now, I don't know, I'm doing two a week now, and it seems to be good.
00:13:14 And I'm trying to keep my, I kept the last one to three hours.
00:13:19 I started getting like cramps in my abdomen around three hours.
00:13:23 And I was like, I'm going to take this as a sign from God to cut it at the three hour mark
00:13:27 before my average viewer number dips.
00:13:30 Abdomen?
00:13:31 Like from sitting?
00:13:34 Like in my guts.
00:13:34 I don't, yeah, I just started, I don't know, I started getting like cramps in my guts.
00:13:40 I'm not, I'm not sure why they actually like went away right after I stopped streaming.
00:13:44 So maybe you were tensing that muscle.
00:13:47 When you were looking at Mega Man.
00:13:50 Maybe it was, maybe it was Twitch chats.
00:13:52 It was Twitch chats fault.
00:13:53 Well, I got to the part in Battle Network 2 where you go to the place where the poor and
00:13:57 the minorities live.
00:13:59 So I was probably really on edge because I was going through a bad part of town.
00:14:04 Yeah, I was watching that part.
00:14:06 Yeah, the basically, the, the, the geography is pretty unclear.
00:14:13 I'm pretty sure I am from a town called AC DC in a, which is like a, a suburb of a city
00:14:21 called Denden City, which is in a country called Electopia, which is sort of Japan.
00:14:28 And I have just, and I have traveled to, there's another place called Yumland that I have not
00:14:33 been to yet.
00:14:34 And I don't know what that's like, but I'm in another place, another country now called
00:14:38 Netopia and Netopia is just America.
00:14:41 It's America, but some people have French accents.
00:14:45 So I guess it's just like a general.
00:14:47 It's just, it's the West.
00:14:48 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:50 There's French people.
00:14:52 There's, there's medieval castles and, and there's, and there's like back alley slums.
00:15:01 So, you know, it's got, it's, it's truly, it's truly got it all.
00:15:06 Well, yeah, I haven't got much to say about the story in Fire Emblem.
00:15:16 It's almost, it's almost non-existent.
00:15:19 It's just sort of like you go from one map to the other and they give you a brief,
00:15:22 like a paragraph or a sentence as to what's going on.
00:15:25 Oh, I missed your stream yesterday, didn't I?
00:15:28 Yeah.
00:15:28 Where were you, huh?
00:15:30 I was, well, I was lifting, but that was like later.
00:15:35 So I was lifting for 24 hours straight.
00:15:37 Yeah, I was, I was, I lifted in the evening.
00:15:40 Ah, yeah.
00:15:41 And I, that was, so those were my evening plans was to lift.
00:15:45 I probably, I probably could have checked in around.
00:15:47 Maybe that's why.
00:15:48 Maybe that's why it was only a few people.
00:15:50 Everyone was lifting.
00:15:51 Everyone was lifting.
00:15:52 Everyone was lifting.
00:15:53 Yeah.
00:15:54 When she called me scrawny.
00:15:58 Can you fucking believe that shit?
00:16:01 Well, I'm trying to remember what did you lost
00:16:05 when I last saw you?
00:16:06 What were you like?
00:16:08 Because you weren't fat Ben at that point.
00:16:10 I don't know if you'd been lifting for a while.
00:16:13 I, no, I had not.
00:16:15 That was like, that was like about a year ago, right?
00:16:19 The last time that was, yeah, last summer.
00:16:23 No, you were here, no.
00:16:26 2022 summer.
00:16:27 No, I, it was, I thought the last time you were here was when I was prepared.
00:16:33 It was when you got COVID, right?
00:16:35 Yeah.
00:16:35 That was in the summer.
00:16:37 We went to the beach.
00:16:39 What?
00:16:40 Well, I don't know.
00:16:41 I don't think you went to the beach, but like it was hot.
00:16:44 It was hot and we went to the beach.
00:16:45 And we did some beach things.
00:16:46 It was like, like off because Munchie was off uni.
00:16:53 Am I smoking crack?
00:16:54 I thought for sure that when you were, you got COVID
00:16:58 and that prevented me from doing the live Mega Man lecture.
00:17:01 True.
00:17:02 And that, and that was in like, I thought that was in like February.
00:17:05 No, that, I wasn't, it was all, it all happened in, in one big time
00:17:13 because I only got the COVID, I only came over and got COVID once
00:17:15 and that was when I was staying during the summer
00:17:18 because I remember it being really hot some nights.
00:17:22 Needy that, that Erecon going.
00:17:27 And then because I got COVID, I had to stay isolated for about a week
00:17:31 and then I hung out for a little time after that.
00:17:36 That's so funny.
00:17:37 I remember one of the last things that happened was we got like,
00:17:41 we went to that like waffle ice cream.
00:17:45 What was it?
00:17:45 Is there some sort of confectioner?
00:17:47 Yeah, the waffle pop place.
00:17:49 Yeah.
00:17:49 And we got a thing and we were walking.
00:17:52 And we were walking here.
00:17:54 We were walking down the old dusty trail.
00:17:58 I'm so confused.
00:17:59 I really thought that was in like March.
00:18:03 Wow.
00:18:03 Time, time is funny.
00:18:10 All right.
00:18:12 Because then it was like after that, it was, it was, you were trying to figure out how to do
00:18:17 the Mega Man thing by yourself instead of in front of a group.
00:18:21 And that took basically like a few months.
00:18:25 Well, it took, it took a few months to play all the games.
00:18:30 But you got that by that point, right?
00:18:32 You had played all, no, you hadn't played all games.
00:18:35 I was going to deliver the lecture without having played any of the games or most of the games.
00:18:40 And then, but I recorded the lecture at the end of August because I remember that was like,
00:18:45 I moved like literally the next day.
00:18:48 So it was the end of August.
00:18:49 And I thought it took me like three or four months to play through the game.
00:18:52 So August, what's before August, July, June, was it in like May or June?
00:18:59 I fucking maybe, did I, did I, did I blast through every Mega Man game in like two months?
00:19:04 Probably crazy.
00:19:05 I remember, all I remember was it was, it was hot.
00:19:08 It was like a hot time.
00:19:10 Maybe, yeah, you know what, you know, maybe you're right.
00:19:13 Yeah.
00:19:13 Okay.
00:19:14 Damn.
00:19:15 I thought that was longer ago.
00:19:17 That's crazy.
00:19:17 That means I thought it had been a year since then, but it's only been like eight months.
00:19:23 To all 10 months.
00:19:24 Well, no, about like eight, no, like eight months.
00:19:27 That's so weird.
00:19:28 Usually these days when I remember things, they happened much longer ago than I think they happened.
00:19:35 What the fuck?
00:19:38 Explain, explain this shit to me.
00:19:40 Sorry.
00:19:42 Um, okay, well that, well that was a tangent.
00:19:44 Could it have been like really warm in March or something?
00:19:47 Yeah, it might, it might have been unseasonably warm in like May.
00:19:52 I could look, I could look through Discord things to be like,
00:19:55 this is the 10th account about it.
00:19:57 Uh, yeah, whatever.
00:19:58 No, that, that, no, I guess that, that makes sense.
00:20:02 Yeah, it's probably, it was probably like May or June.
00:20:05 Yeah, whatever.
00:20:06 Cool.
00:20:06 Okay.
00:20:07 I believe it.
00:20:08 I'm just fucked up.
00:20:09 I'm just, I'm just so, I'm just, maybe I'm confusing it with when you were there for
00:20:13 New Year's because we're, because you're there for New Year's, right?
00:20:15 And then you were there again that summer.
00:20:17 Was I there for New Year's?
00:20:19 No, I don't think I was.
00:20:21 I think I was invited.
00:20:22 I think, was that like a big group of people?
00:20:24 I think, oh wait, there was a big group of people.
00:20:27 Some people came for New Year's and then you didn't, you didn't come, you didn't
00:20:31 end up coming.
00:20:32 And I think it was because there were, someone rescheduled or something happened to change
00:20:37 the schedule and you were like, you were gonna come, oh, you didn't come because like COVID
00:20:40 restrictions, right?
00:20:43 Yeah, there was a time I was going to come and it was going to be early in the year,
00:20:46 but I couldn't come because somebody in my family got COVID, like they tested positive.
00:20:55 The day, the day that I was supposed to fly.
00:20:58 So it was like, you don't know that you're safe.
00:21:01 So I had to, we all had to isolate and stuff.
00:21:05 So I had to change, I had to cancel that or like reschedule it for
00:21:08 summer of the same year.
00:21:12 And then it was a summer party and I bought that summer hat, which I still have,
00:21:15 which I like, and I'm going to be using soon when the fucking sun comes back.
00:21:20 Well, thank you for, thank you for helping me to reconstruct my shattered memories,
00:21:28 my chain of memories.
00:21:29 Just like Kingdom Hearts.
00:21:31 Just like Kingdom Hearts.
00:21:32 Yeah.
00:21:34 How did I, oh, anyway, Munchy called me scrawny.
00:21:38 All that's the same.
00:21:40 I would have been, yeah, I don't think I had been lifting basically at all for like almost a year
00:21:44 or at least six months or so the last time you were here.
00:21:48 Uh, now I weigh about the same, but I'm ripped.
00:21:54 It's not true.
00:21:55 I'm only a little bit strong.
00:21:59 That's why I'm scrawny.
00:22:00 So it's larger your muscles, the less time you spend on Twitter.
00:22:06 It's just not no correlation, just sort of like a funny coincidence.
00:22:11 Not to, with the less my muscles, the less on Twitter or the, or is it like,
00:22:16 as one goes up, the other goes down.
00:22:18 As muscles go up, Twitter usage goes down.
00:22:21 Yeah, maybe so.
00:22:23 Maybe that means I got to get huge.
00:22:26 Munchy is, it's funny.
00:22:27 Munchy is like, Munchy's bench press is already, you know, he's done a lot less
00:22:35 lifting than me in life.
00:22:37 So he's, compared to me at it, he's a bit of a noob on his technique and things like that.
00:22:42 Nevertheless, his bench press is already like almost the same as mine.
00:22:46 It's just because he's bigger, which is, you know, that's, that's, that's just life,
00:22:51 I guess.
00:22:51 However, his squat is terrible.
00:22:53 And he has actually like injured himself several times while squatting and had to
00:22:57 like stop squatting because he got like, he like pulled an adductor or something.
00:23:02 So his squat is, is minuscule, but his bench press is threatening.
00:23:08 So, you know,
00:23:10 I think I did some workouts in that, that basement.
00:23:16 On the rack?
00:23:17 Yeah, I used the thing, but I couldn't.
00:23:19 Yeah, the power rack.
00:23:21 I couldn't lift the bar with anything on it.
00:23:25 I could only use the bar and only just.
00:23:28 What lift, were you trying to squat it?
00:23:30 I was, I was, I was just doing what they were doing.
00:23:32 So I was doing a curl and then I did a bench press.
00:23:35 Yeah.
00:23:36 And I don't, I don't think I did a squat yet to put that like
00:23:39 behind your back.
00:23:41 Yeah, on your shoulders, cringe.
00:23:43 That's literally the most important one.
00:23:45 Literally, literally the most important one.
00:23:47 I did that with the smaller weights, with the hand weights.
00:23:50 Oh, hand dumbbells, dumbbell squats, disgusting.
00:23:58 That's, I was, I was doing some, some weightlifting tourism.
00:24:01 I wasn't really interested.
00:24:02 At least you're not one of those perverts that squats with the bar on their back,
00:24:09 but they put the fricking like roll pad on the bar to like, ooh, cushion it.
00:24:13 Ooh, I'll put the little cushion on the bar because I'm such a fucking idiot
00:24:17 that I rested on my fricking.
00:24:19 Cushion.
00:24:20 Wouldn't that just make it slip?
00:24:22 Well, there's, sometimes in the squat rack, you see a little circular,
00:24:26 it's like, it's like a Velcro round little cushion that you can sort of
00:24:30 like Velcro on to the center of the bar to like rest it on the back of your neck.
00:24:36 The thing about that is that.
00:24:37 All I'm thinking of is if it's not perfectly fixed to the bar,
00:24:41 then it would rotate, it would rotate and then it would slide down your back,
00:24:45 wouldn't it?
00:24:45 Well, there's like potential, that's all I'm asking.
00:24:49 Yeah, I see, I see what you mean.
00:24:51 I mean, it really shouldn't do that.
00:24:52 But the thing about it is you really don't need it,
00:24:55 because if you're squatting correctly, the bar is not, you know,
00:24:58 you got the little like, I don't know what it's called,
00:25:00 the little bone bulge on the back of your neck.
00:25:03 It gets it's a vertebra.
00:25:04 A shoulder pad.
00:25:08 No, no, no, on the neck, on the neck.
00:25:12 Yeah, I don't know.
00:25:14 I don't know bones.
00:25:15 You can feel the vertebra of your, of like the back of your neck.
00:25:18 Like if you're a freaking, yeah, if you're an idiot,
00:25:21 then yeah, it would be really uncomfortable to have the bar rest on your vertebra.
00:25:25 But you're not supposed to do that.
00:25:28 It should be on your shoulders.
00:25:29 It should be resting on your shoulders.
00:25:31 On your shoulder blades, that's the word.
00:25:34 Right, but no, not on the blades.
00:25:35 Like on the, on the, on the, on the divot between the trapezius and the,
00:25:40 whatever the shoulder muscle is called.
00:25:42 Oh, the trapezius.
00:25:44 Yes, the traps.
00:25:46 No, that's why they're called traps.
00:25:48 No relation, no relation.
00:25:50 Okay.
00:25:52 The trap is the big, well here, let's let's examine, let's examine.
00:25:59 Wait, is that, is that why they're called traps?
00:26:02 What, you mean boys?
00:26:04 I mean girls?
00:26:06 No.
00:26:07 Oh.
00:26:08 The, the, the like neck muscles, I've heard them refer to as traps,
00:26:15 like the big neck muscles when like Goku has one big one.
00:26:19 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because it's the trapezius.
00:26:21 It's the trapezi, I think it's the trapezius dorsi.
00:26:24 Wow.
00:26:25 Or no, it's just the trapezius.
00:26:27 I never really thought about it that they would have a real name.
00:26:30 If you can believe it, they really do.
00:26:33 Like pecs or pectorals, like duh.
00:26:35 Right, so anyway, what was I talking about?
00:26:39 Here's, here's the view, the deltoid, right?
00:26:41 If you, if you squat correctly, the bar is resting on the divot between the trapezius
00:26:47 and the deltoid.
00:26:48 It's not resting on, on the bones of the neck.
00:26:51 So you really don't need that cushion.
00:26:54 What if you have a fucked up weird neck?
00:26:56 Uh, well, gosh, I mean, I guess if it's, I don't know, I mean, how fucked up are we talking?
00:27:07 Well, I guess I'm thinking of like, like Gamerneck, like it's going forward.
00:27:11 I got a bad case of Gamerneck.
00:27:13 Where it's like going, like leaning forwards a lot.
00:27:16 But that would get it further out of the way.
00:27:20 So it'll be like some sort of anti Gamerneck where you're like, your neck comes back.
00:27:26 I think maybe, maybe if you're really stiff and you have a bad range of motion,
00:27:30 it might be difficult to get it in the proper position resting on the deltoids.
00:27:35 I think a little bit of stretching and a little bit of practice would limber almost
00:27:40 anyone up to the point that it would, uh, that it would rest.
00:27:43 I mean, I mean, proper squat form takes practice.
00:27:46 It's, it's, it's a, it's a fairly, it's a fairly complex, complicated movement to do.
00:27:52 And you sort of just have to practice it and practice it until you get the form right.
00:27:57 So, yeah, but once you figure it out, the point is you don't need that pad if you're
00:28:03 doing it correctly.
00:28:04 But anyway, the reason I bring this all up, I don't know, I've started, I've started cycling
00:28:10 creatine. I've started doing that again in the hopes of, uh, becoming huge once more.
00:28:17 Once upon a time I was huge. It wasn't that huge, but I was dead.
00:28:21 I, I deadlifted 300 a couple of years ago and that's my goal again.
00:28:25 I'd like to deadlift 300.
00:28:27 I'm actually almost there.
00:28:27 I'm at like 275.
00:28:30 So, but I'm sort of installing on my squad.
00:28:33 I've been stalling on my squad at like 220.
00:28:35 So, you know, I'm going to start cycling creatine again and hopefully blast,
00:28:44 blast past the plateau and become my best self.
00:28:50 The strong, I'll be the, I'll be the cutest and the strongest.
00:28:54 That's my goal.
00:28:55 I've completely stopped exercising or moving at all.
00:28:59 Idiot.
00:29:01 Idiot.
00:29:03 It's, I would die.
00:29:05 Uh, you know, I mean, I will.
00:29:07 This is not, this is not, this is not life.
00:29:10 This is gradual death.
00:29:12 That's you.
00:29:14 That's, that's, that's Osho talking to you right now.
00:29:17 Oh, I love Osho.
00:29:18 Waste, waste in a way.
00:29:20 Do you know, do you know what I'm talking about?
00:29:22 I know from, and I learned about it from the red letter media episode where they
00:29:25 do a video of his.
00:29:27 Well, there's, um,
00:29:28 And he's like a, he's a, he's a cult leader.
00:29:31 Um, insane boy.
00:29:33 He's, he's like, I don't know whether he's insane, but he's just like very good at
00:29:38 manipulating people to believe his bullshit.
00:29:41 And he did it.
00:29:42 That's actually the, yeah, that one they're talking about in that one is
00:29:45 actually the same, it's the Rajneesh Purim cult that, uh, there's a down the
00:29:50 rabbit hole about the same, the same thing.
00:29:52 It's the same dudes.
00:29:55 Lamal.
00:29:56 And I guess there's also a documentary.
00:29:57 I think those guys, the red letter media guys knew about it because of a
00:30:00 documentary I know about it because of down the rabbit hole.
00:30:04 Also a documentary.
00:30:06 That honestly, uh, uh, Nuds Frederick Knudsen probably knew about it because of the
00:30:12 documentary.
00:30:18 Yeah, I need to get back into doing anything.
00:30:21 It's just been, when it's, when it's so cold, when it's so chilly, I mean, it's not
00:30:25 so much chilly anymore.
00:30:27 But yeah, all I wanted to do is wrap it in a blanket and sit on my chair.
00:30:32 I'm really happy that, um, the guys over at, um, what I will call Munchie House,
00:30:41 decided to get back into lifting with me.
00:30:43 I don't think I would have the willpower to do it by myself.
00:30:48 Also, it's kind of dangerous to do it by yourself.
00:30:51 Oh yeah.
00:30:52 So I don't know, I was really happy that those guys, I think maybe like, maybe like
00:30:58 four months ago or something, we're like, we want to get back into it.
00:31:02 And I was like, hell yeah, I'm in.
00:31:05 You son of a bitch.
00:31:06 You son of a, and we've been, we've been pretty consistent about it, uh, for a while now.
00:31:12 And that feels really good.
00:31:13 And I'm really, uh, you know, I like that.
00:31:17 If I had, I think they, if they have to move, I'm, there's, I have a basement.
00:31:24 They have a really nice basement that has a lot of room and a lot of like ceiling space.
00:31:28 You've, you've been there.
00:31:29 Yeah.
00:31:29 Um, if they have to move, I might be able to move the rack.
00:31:33 I have space in my basement, but the ceiling is low.
00:31:38 So I think I could fit the rack there.
00:31:41 You know, it would probably be fine.
00:31:42 I would just have to do like sitting overhead presses, which is acceptable.
00:31:47 You have to dig a hole to stand in if you wanted to lift it up.
00:31:50 Well, at my old place at monkey house, uh, I deadlifted so hard that I crushed the concrete
00:31:58 under the, under the bars.
00:32:00 So when I would deadlift, like the, the, the plates would be sitting in like two
00:32:04 like crushed divots of like pulverized concrete.
00:32:08 Like you mean you dropped it afterwards?
00:32:11 Uh, I didn't like full on like drop it like freehand, but I did sort of like,
00:32:17 you know, I would, I would pretty much like hit it.
00:32:19 It would hit the ground pretty hard.
00:32:21 And yeah, eventually I cracked the ground and like it pulverized some of the,
00:32:26 some of the floor, whatever.
00:32:28 It's cheap.
00:32:28 I told, I told the guys I would, uh, I would patch it with like a patching putty.
00:32:33 Never did.
00:32:34 Just moved out.
00:32:36 Left the damage.
00:32:38 Lemau.
00:32:41 Um, moving that rack was such a nightmare.
00:32:45 It was like a whole, it added a whole other step to like the moving process,
00:32:51 but it was worth it because now I'm strong.
00:32:57 What do you, what do you think about that?
00:32:59 I don't know.
00:33:00 I don't need to see it till we believe it.
00:33:03 That's right.
00:33:04 I am for, I look, I look pretty much the same.
00:33:07 Uh, I look pretty much the same.
00:33:09 Maybe I look a little bit more cut.
00:33:12 I don't know.
00:33:13 I haven't like a lot.
00:33:13 I would have to like, I would have to like lose a bunch of weight.
00:33:17 If I like, I might look a little bit good.
00:33:20 If I cut like 20 pounds, I might, you might, I might be a little more noticeably
00:33:25 muscular than maybe I would have been to ever months ago, but like, I'm not going to do that.
00:33:30 I think I want to focus on getting huge for a while more until I start to feel like,
00:33:39 I don't know, until I feel like, wow, I'm actually a little bit ripped.
00:33:43 And maybe then I'll cut, maybe then I'll, I'll focus on cutting fat and becoming,
00:33:48 becoming cut like a diamond, shredded.
00:33:53 That's the goal.
00:33:53 I don't, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not ripped enough yet that I need,
00:33:56 want to be like, all right, time to cut, time to cut the fat and show these gains.
00:34:01 But soon, very soon.
00:34:05 You want to get abs that you could grate cheese with?
00:34:08 I mean, that'd be cool.
00:34:10 At the very least.
00:34:10 You don't even need to buy a grater.
00:34:12 It saves money.
00:34:13 Like to have huge shoulders.
00:34:15 Big, big, big bulgy shoulders are cool.
00:34:18 I have kind of bulgy shoulders.
00:34:20 I have kind of a wide shoulder pads.
00:34:23 I have kind of like a wide frame and like wide shoulders.
00:34:25 So I think it might be, I don't know, I think maybe to enhance my natural physique,
00:34:30 a big, big shoulders would be like, yeah.
00:34:35 Just lean into it.
00:34:36 Just lean into what's, what's already, what you've already got going on.
00:34:41 So, you know, that's the plan.
00:34:44 That's the plan.
00:34:46 Speaking of the plan, the perfect comic party last week.
00:34:52 Yeah.
00:34:52 Oh, I, I spent some time.
00:34:54 I made a little logo, I guess it's basically done.
00:34:59 You showed me the logo and I told you, I don't, I mean, I think I expressed to you
00:35:04 how much I liked it.
00:35:04 Let me just express, I love, I love it.
00:35:07 I love how it looks.
00:35:08 Thank you.
00:35:09 I can't wait to put it.
00:35:11 I want to put it, if you, if you have like a high res version,
00:35:14 I'd like to put it on the website and I, and I'd like to like maybe make it then,
00:35:19 well, maybe not yet, but soon make it the new channel icon.
00:35:22 I'm going to put it on the Patreon and stuff.
00:35:25 The website is live.
00:35:26 I figured it out if you, now, right now, if you go to perfectcomicparty.com,
00:35:34 it redirects you to the procrastinatorspodcast.com.
00:35:38 And the procrastinatorspodcast.com shows the new, the new website, which, I mean, it's not,
00:35:44 you know, and it's got most of the episodes.
00:35:52 It's got a lot of the episodes uploaded for download.
00:35:57 I'm working on getting them all up there.
00:36:00 It does not have, there's a stuff page that has links to the Dojan and Road to Radcon.
00:36:05 That stuff's not actually there yet.
00:36:07 It's just like a blank download link, but it will be there soon.
00:36:12 And I haven't actually looked to the site yet, but yeah, looking at all these text on the gradient.
00:36:20 It's, you know, it's pretty, you know, it's, it's a, it's a website written in HTML.
00:36:28 Yeah, let me, let me, let me look at it.
00:36:32 Let's, let's, let's throw up a screenshot.
00:36:33 I've never seen, I've never seen like a list in text, all of the PCP episodes.
00:36:39 Oh yeah.
00:36:41 Like scrolling through history right now.
00:36:44 It's, I think I want to, somebody in a, in a comment suggested, yeah, when you go to the,
00:36:49 the archive list, you see all the episodes, all, there must be like 400 mp3s on here.
00:36:59 Um, if you go all the way down.
00:37:04 Oh, so it just opens a download link, okay.
00:37:09 Uh, let's, let me, well, well, some of these are not actually here.
00:37:14 If you go to maybe, okay, that one does, and yeah, it, yeah, it just downloads the mp3.
00:37:21 Um, but anyway, what was I saying?
00:37:25 Uh, shit, I was going to make a point about something, but it's gone.
00:37:33 Uh, the new website, it's got text on it.
00:37:36 Oh, I want to put the logo, I want to put the logo up top.
00:37:39 Yes, well, I think, I guess I can, I don't know if I was totally finished or.
00:37:45 Okay, okay, okay.
00:37:45 I think I was though, I, I did like, I did, I added the, I added the,
00:37:50 I can give you the Photoshop or the Clip Studio.
00:37:53 Do you have, do you have Clip Studio?
00:37:55 Well, I use Manga Studio, which is like supposedly the same program.
00:37:59 So it might work.
00:38:02 Okay.
00:38:03 I, otherwise I can send you a Photoshop with all the layers and you can move them around and stuff.
00:38:10 Uh, I, I mean, I do want the layers, but I mean, I, I think either one is fine.
00:38:16 Um, yeah.
00:38:18 So, yeah, if you look at, um, I made a Kofi, I made a PCP Kofi.
00:38:26 Uh, we should put that, we'll link that in places.
00:38:30 Stuff has, yeah, Road to Radcon and the Paradise Dosion and links to my site,
00:38:36 if anyone wants print copies, because they do have print copies of, of those sitting around.
00:38:41 Well, I do, I have a print copy of Paradise.
00:38:44 I have, I have a big box of Road to Radcon that I would like to get rid of if anyone wants one.
00:38:49 They have really the beautiful, the beautiful cover art by Mishi.
00:38:52 I already have my copy.
00:38:54 It's a collect, it's a collector's item.
00:38:56 I think I, I think I have like, I must have at least like 40 of those just sitting in a box.
00:39:01 I'd really like to get rid of them.
00:39:05 Uh, the PCP Dating Sim, the PCP Minecraft server, a link to Endless War and your website, my website.
00:39:11 Uh, I could maybe add anything else to think of.
00:39:16 Um, yeah, so I figured out all the URL fuckery and stuff.
00:39:23 I think I'm probably going to download all the files we had on Bluehost.
00:39:28 I'm probably going to take all the files off there and save them somewhere.
00:39:33 I would like to just cancel Bluehost and I wonder if, is there a way we can just like,
00:39:38 migrate the domain of a Procrastinator's podcast to Dreamhost?
00:39:43 Um, that's, should be possible.
00:39:47 It seems possible.
00:39:49 It's just sometimes hosting and stuff that can be annoying about how to maneuver it around.
00:39:57 Well, we don't really, we don't need to do that right away.
00:40:03 Cause like the website is working now, but like, you know, the Bluehost is now extraneous.
00:40:08 It's just extra hosting costs that we don't really need to pay.
00:40:11 So, uh, you know, I'd like to get rid of it as soon as possible, but it's not like super urgent.
00:40:19 So yeah, the new website and I'm going to, I'm going to, I'll try to like gussy it up a little
00:40:25 bit with like the, those icons you made and maybe I'll make the fonts a little bit.
00:40:31 I mean, this is kind of plain font is like fine.
00:40:34 Yeah. So it's just readable and it is.
00:40:37 But anyway, yeah, if you're, if you're listening to this, you can at the, at the, okay.
00:40:42 People asked for the podcast apps.
00:40:46 Uh, you know, I have not updated the Spotify or Apple podcast or anything like that.
00:40:51 But if what you want is like a downloadable mp3s that you can listen to,
00:40:55 if you want downloadable mp3s of all the episodes, all the past episodes ever,
00:41:01 they're here and they're on the procrastinatorspodcast.com.
00:41:05 And you just go to, yeah, the procrastinators podcast episode archive link.
00:41:09 And there's a whole list of them and they are mostly there.
00:41:14 And if anything is missing, you can let me know in the comments and I will try and get it up there.
00:41:19 Uh, yeah.
00:41:21 So I'm glad to have gotten that sorted out.
00:41:24 I was really, I was really banging my head first against like,
00:41:30 how do I actually put the files on the, the internet?
00:41:34 Like we own the domain.
00:41:36 How do I put the files there?
00:41:38 I had forgotten how to do that.
00:41:40 And then once I did remember it, I was like, okay, okay,
00:41:43 I remember how to put files on the internet.
00:41:45 But now how do I make it so that I've got the, I've got the original website.
00:41:51 I want to one, replace it with a new website and then two,
00:41:55 make a second domain redirect to it.
00:41:59 And figuring out both, I figured those out yesterday.
00:42:03 So I'm glad to have done that.
00:42:06 Yeah.
00:42:07 And, uh, that was like productivity wise.
00:42:10 That's most of what I, that's most of what I got this week.
00:42:14 But it's, but it's, it's not nothing.
00:42:16 So I feel okay about it.
00:42:18 Yeah.
00:42:19 Yeah.
00:42:20 Yeah.
00:42:20 Yeah.
00:42:21 Yeah.
00:42:21 It's not nothing.
00:42:22 It's not nothing.
00:42:22 You know, it's, you can say it's not nothing.
00:42:24 That's pretty good.
00:42:27 Anytime it's not nothing, you should feel good about that.
00:42:29 It's like my old thermodynamics teacher used to say,
00:42:31 when you solve a physics problem, it's important to feel,
00:42:34 let yourself feel good about it so that you will condition yourself
00:42:37 to want to do more in the future.
00:42:40 If you beat yourself up about it, oh, I didn't do it fast enough.
00:42:42 Oh, I didn't do it good enough.
00:42:44 Then you're going to teach yourself that getting things done
00:42:48 just gives you pain and that's not going to.
00:42:51 I wish I had that advice when I was young.
00:42:55 I just ended up feeling pain constantly.
00:42:59 Well, you know, it's good advice.
00:43:01 It's hard to internalize and live by consistently, but I mean,
00:43:07 I, it's good if you can manage it.
00:43:09 I've been learning that basic lesson with my therapist.
00:43:13 I think I talked about it last time, just sort of noting down
00:43:17 things I've done and like just noting that they have been accomplished.
00:43:23 So I look back on the week and I'm like, oh, yeah,
00:43:25 I guess I did all that stuff because I often forget.
00:43:28 That guy, that guy was like a, that guy was like a Buddhist like
00:43:33 monk or something or he like worked at like a Buddhist temple,
00:43:37 like a couple of towns over.
00:43:39 And he was like an adjunct professor who they had got in to replace.
00:43:44 We had had like a much older, like a very accomplished older guy
00:43:49 who had written like the textbook.
00:43:50 He literally wrote the textbook for the class.
00:43:54 But that guy had like, he was very old and he was going through some health
00:43:57 things and I think he was got, he got too sick.
00:44:01 Like, like literally the year I showed up and was supposed to be taking
00:44:04 this class, they were like, he can't do this anymore.
00:44:06 We got to get it.
00:44:07 We got to get some new guy in.
00:44:09 So we got this fricking Buddhist guy and that guy,
00:44:12 he gave us all these like sage wisdoms and stuff and he was like, hey,
00:44:16 don't worry about it, just feel good about it.
00:44:18 But then he would assign, he would assign like PhD level questions to us.
00:44:22 And like we found where he was getting his homework questions for us
00:44:25 and they were, they were like PhD qualifying level.
00:44:28 So he would assign these unrealistically difficult things
00:44:32 and then he would just grade them like really leniently.
00:44:36 But it sucked because we didn't know that he was going to grade them leniently.
00:44:39 So we all would like get together and spend all night banging our head against
00:44:42 these things and not be able to figure out, turn in like shittily,
00:44:45 like barely solved, like probably wrong answers and then we would get them back
00:44:49 and he'd be like, oh yeah, well this was pretty much wrong,
00:44:51 but I guess you couldn't have known that.
00:44:52 So it'd be plus.
00:44:56 Hey, feel good about it though.
00:44:57 Take a minute and just feel good.
00:45:00 Feel good that you tried or something.
00:45:03 You tried and you accomplished.
00:45:05 You figured some of it out and like that's good enough.
00:45:09 Isn't the point purpose of school to be taught how to figure that out?
00:45:14 Well, that's what the textbook is for.
00:45:16 Not just tested on it.
00:45:18 Well, that's what the, well, I mean, he did give,
00:45:21 all you need to do, all you need to do to get good PhD results
00:45:25 for a baby, you just give them the same, like a series of tests
00:45:29 over and over again and then eventually they'll get it.
00:45:33 Just every day, just click.
00:45:35 Every day, give them a test.
00:45:36 Like, hey, can you, can you walk?
00:45:37 Let's test, let's test your walking.
00:45:39 Oh, you failed today.
00:45:40 Okay.
00:45:41 And then, you know, several hundred tests later, eventually they'll pass
00:45:44 and it's all because you, it's all because of your encouragement.
00:45:52 Yeah, so that was, that was the first thing I did in the week.
00:45:57 Oh, the logos.
00:45:59 Yeah, the logo.
00:46:00 They're so good.
00:46:01 I don't know if we want to like show them.
00:46:04 Do you want to show them or do you want to keep them a surprise?
00:46:08 I mean, let me just screen grab them right now because I've got them open.
00:46:16 Do you think this is at a point where it's like, yeah, this is finished.
00:46:21 We shall, we shall, this shall be what it is.
00:46:27 Because I can, I can, I don't really know what to edit about them.
00:46:30 I think they're pretty good.
00:46:31 I think they look, I would be perfectly, I'm perfectly happy with this
00:46:35 going on the, on the, the book.
00:46:39 Oh, you know what?
00:46:40 I know, I, I know I asked for the, I don't, I don't think I would put the,
00:46:44 on the, on the PDF.
00:46:47 I would want that for like maybe the website.
00:46:49 Yeah, yeah.
00:46:49 That's just the file as it appears currently.
00:46:52 Right.
00:46:53 No, I'm, I'm think this is perfectly good and like no notes.
00:46:58 This, this can go, this can go right on the, the comic or the, the zine or whatever we're calling it.
00:47:04 Yes.
00:47:07 So.
00:47:07 With regards to that,
00:47:12 well, kind of related, not exactly, but I've been making a PDF ready, a print version
00:47:18 ready of Clarissa for a, an Amazon Kindle direct publishing
00:47:27 sort of thing that Amazon can do, which is my next, my next goal.
00:47:32 I had sort of a crisis in this, this week where I was like talking to my therapist.
00:47:39 My therapist was like, well, I mean, don't you want to make money?
00:47:43 Like how, how, how expensive is this comic?
00:47:47 What are you going to set up for?
00:47:47 And I'm like, oh, I'm going to put it up on the internet for free.
00:47:51 Right.
00:47:51 And they're like, but what else would he, what, huh?
00:47:54 What are you stupid?
00:47:55 What are you idiot?
00:47:56 Right.
00:47:56 And I was like, oh no, I am, I am idiot.
00:47:59 Right, right.
00:48:00 I need to monetize.
00:48:02 I need to, I, I, I avoid it because I don't know.
00:48:06 I guess I should have a thing about it.
00:48:08 The thing about like putting a price tag on my work and statements and marketing and, I don't know.
00:48:18 Yeah, for sure.
00:48:19 It's, it's maybe, maybe a more like a, like a focused determination of whether what I've
00:48:28 made is good is whether it makes money.
00:48:30 And I'm like, I don't, I just want to avoid that whole question.
00:48:33 Yeah, I, yeah, I know what you mean.
00:48:35 No, that makes no sense.
00:48:37 But there's no harm in having the ability for people to buy it.
00:48:42 So I've been, I did the PC, the perfect comic party logo.
00:48:48 And then I started trying to figure out how to monetize and I've got a plan.
00:48:52 And I'm going to make, I'm going to make closer chapters one to four into a PDF.
00:49:01 And I'm going to put that on Amazon so you can buy it as a Kindle digital version.
00:49:07 And with the Amazon Direct Publishing, I looked into this.
00:49:12 It's print on demand.
00:49:15 If you type in Amazon print on demand, that's a different service.
00:49:17 This is Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.
00:49:20 Okay.
00:49:21 Which was confusing for a bit.
00:49:23 But yeah, you make a book as a PDF or some other thing and it will be printable by the
00:49:33 consumer without me having to do any work printing it and sending it.
00:49:39 That's actually, yeah, the fact that you don't have to do the shipping yourself,
00:49:43 that probably saves you like so much money because Amazon can ship stuff so much cheaper
00:49:48 than you can.
00:49:49 They can.
00:49:49 They can obviously print it so much cheaper as well.
00:49:51 And Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Lord of Ghosts, which I will do as well.
00:49:56 I'll do the Lord of Ghosts.
00:49:57 I'll do a Redman version so you could buy a physical Redman thing for people who missed
00:50:01 the Kickstarter.
00:50:05 And it'll be, you know, it's going to be a storefront.
00:50:08 It's going to be, I'm going to sell my work.
00:50:11 I may even make a Bale JAPE hardback little book.
00:50:16 That's actually probably all that stuff together.
00:50:18 It's actually probably like a really good idea.
00:50:20 Yeah.
00:50:21 That's going to take a while to like settle those PDFs up because they're so exact.
00:50:25 They're so specific.
00:50:27 I was like opening all of the many tabs and like learning and relearning about exactly
00:50:34 what a margin is and what bleed means.
00:50:37 And when you, you know, when you set like, they have a system, I think for any print
00:50:44 company, but Amazon explained it as the size, the number of pages determines how big the inner
00:50:51 margin has to be because of, you know, the more pages there are, the less the book can open flat.
00:50:58 So you have to change the margins based on how many pages.
00:51:02 Now, because the spine is thicker?
00:51:06 Yeah.
00:51:06 The spine is thicker.
00:51:06 Therefore, the inner margin should be, it should be thicker to accommodate for readability,
00:51:12 you know that.
00:51:13 Yes.
00:51:15 And the choice of ink, the choice of paper quality changes certain things.
00:51:23 And I figured out all that for Clarissa at least.
00:51:26 Yeah.
00:51:27 I put in all the numbers.
00:51:28 I know the bleed.
00:51:29 I have the file that is the right dimensions in centimeters and inches and pixels or whatever.
00:51:37 And I'm going to put it up there.
00:51:38 I'm going to make it.
00:51:39 That's next week.
00:51:40 I'm going to make it.
00:51:41 It's going to be made.
00:51:42 That rules.
00:51:43 That's really cool.
00:51:44 That's probably that's probably going to do.
00:51:47 That's actually, it actually sounds great.
00:51:51 I'm imagining like imagine if you could just make a book and you didn't have to take orders
00:51:58 and buy envelopes and address the envelopes and bring them and bring them to the post office.
00:52:03 Imagine that's incredible.
00:52:07 I want to check the quality before I like officially answer it.
00:52:11 I should look into it and see like how much am I really saving?
00:52:15 How much am I really saving by doing it myself?
00:52:18 For me personally.
00:52:20 For you it's worse because you're in the UK, I think.
00:52:23 Absolutely.
00:52:23 That's absolutely a major factor.
00:52:26 But also the whole printing and sending and organizing of all that is so much like hard labor
00:52:36 mentally and physically.
00:52:39 But like mostly just to keep track of everything that I should be getting a bigger,
00:52:45 a much bigger paycheck than what I'm actually getting doing it myself.
00:52:50 So the fact that Amazon takes care of all of that and they're such a large company that
00:52:55 they can print this stuff like without, they don't need to buy 100 of them.
00:53:02 Just let Daddy Bezos take care of that for you.
00:53:04 Just leave it up to him.
00:53:06 He'll take care of everything.
00:53:07 Don't worry about the money.
00:53:08 Don't worry about the money, Kip.
00:53:10 Just let Amazon take care of it for you.
00:53:13 Look, look.
00:53:14 It's so easy.
00:53:15 Isn't it just the easy thing to do?
00:53:17 Isn't it just the frictionless way to go about things?
00:53:22 We just make it so easy for you.
00:53:23 They'll have like a thing on the submit your PDF and there's a box checking,
00:53:31 like checked, like a use slave labor, yes or no.
00:53:36 If you click yes, much cheaper.
00:53:38 You get much better returns.
00:53:39 But if you uncheck it, less money, less money for you.
00:53:47 Hey, slaves need jobs too.
00:53:49 Click.
00:53:51 It would be wrong to take that slave's job away.
00:53:58 We're all trying to make it in our little world.
00:54:00 Well, I guess there's no ethical consumption under capitalism anyway.
00:54:08 Yeah.
00:54:08 I mean, most people never think about any of that.
00:54:11 The fact that I think about it is merely just a frustration for me.
00:54:15 The fact that I know that I'm putting some slave into a work camp, at least I acknowledge.
00:54:25 At least I'm aware that that's what I'm doing.
00:54:27 No.
00:54:32 Now I've made a kerfuffle, but it's fine.
00:54:36 I'm also probably going to look into it and just see how much.
00:54:42 I think I'll try with the Clarissa.
00:54:45 I want to see if the quality is good because my initial reservations were,
00:54:50 are they going to be good for image print?
00:54:54 Because maybe it's just good for text.
00:54:56 But they sell children's books that way, which are entirely illustrated.
00:55:01 Obviously, you got your little publishing independent author and they're like,
00:55:08 I want to sell my children's book.
00:55:09 It has to be good enough.
00:55:11 It can't be shit quality.
00:55:13 Otherwise, nobody would ever use it.
00:55:20 But I'm going to check.
00:55:21 I'm going to do the Clarissa chapters one to four.
00:55:25 And then if it's good, I'll do the rest of my books.
00:55:28 And it'll all be available forever.
00:55:33 And if that's not the case, I'll at least make PDFs that you can purchase if you want to support me.
00:55:38 I'll put that on Amazon anyway, but also on Gumroad, I think, for the same price.
00:55:44 Just in case you don't want Amazon getting anything.
00:55:47 I got physical copies of, actually, at almost the same time.
00:55:54 I got the two test copies of Slime and Punishment.
00:55:57 And I got the test copy of the Radcon for Dojin.
00:56:05 And the Dojin looks good, except the margins were a little bit, I was a little bit,
00:56:11 I cut it a little close with the margins.
00:56:14 And it's mostly fine, except some of the page numbers were cut off.
00:56:17 So I adjusted the position of the page numbers.
00:56:19 And I'm probably going to print another test copy.
00:56:23 But other than that, the bleeds all looked OK.
00:56:26 It's pretty nice.
00:56:29 It looks like a little mini-manga.
00:56:32 I guess I could post a picture of it.
00:56:36 Maybe I'll do that.
00:56:39 Let's see.
00:56:39 Where did I?
00:56:41 I'll post the logo that I sent you.
00:56:44 So that's what it looks like, everybody.
00:56:46 Yes.
00:56:47 Oh, it looks so good.
00:56:51 It looks so shiny.
00:56:54 I love it.
00:56:55 Imagine little enamel pins of that.
00:56:58 Oh, I didn't even think of that.
00:57:01 That's what I was thinking.
00:57:01 Oh, I didn't even think of that.
00:57:02 Oh, it's shiny, just like my favorite thing.
00:57:05 A little enamel pin.
00:57:08 It's got a little raised up thing.
00:57:09 I did not even think about it.
00:57:12 The perfect comic pin.
00:57:14 The perfect comic pin.
00:57:15 Yeah, true.
00:57:18 Yeah.
00:57:19 And I'm imagining, I'm just imagining, I don't know.
00:57:26 You can make it different colors, different issues if you want.
00:57:29 Oh, wait.
00:57:31 I had another question.
00:57:32 I had another thing to raise, but I will mention that in a moment.
00:57:38 Let me just look at my PCP folder.
00:57:42 Let me go to my Radcon folder.
00:57:45 Let me go to the Dojin folder.
00:57:47 And let me show you.
00:57:49 Well, while you're doing that, I also have an announcement
00:57:53 for a new version of the Gibbentake.site website.
00:57:59 I'm revamping it.
00:58:01 And it's going to be nice and good.
00:58:04 That's probably also going to happen next week.
00:58:07 Is it live now?
00:58:10 Oh, next week, you said.
00:58:11 Okay.
00:58:11 Yeah, next week.
00:58:13 Yeah, Ben Rodia.
00:58:15 Ben Rodia, the person behind the famous giant punk plush
00:58:21 that he gave me at Radcon floor.
00:58:23 Meetup.
00:58:23 I didn't know it was the same guy.
00:58:25 Yeah, that's the guy.
00:58:26 Oh, that's awesome.
00:58:27 Okay.
00:58:27 And he's just approached.
00:58:30 He wanted to do the PCP website.
00:58:32 Yeah, I know.
00:58:34 I just said.
00:58:34 Ben was like, is more like, better, better as a list.
00:58:38 And I guess, I guess we don't need like a big revamp.
00:58:41 I just said.
00:58:44 Okay.
00:58:44 I mean, I said, yeah, he said he would do it.
00:58:47 And he said he would make it fancy.
00:58:48 And he said he would charge some money to make it fancy.
00:58:50 And I said, well, I can just make it, I can make it cheap
00:58:53 and quick and dirty for free.
00:58:55 And that's what I did.
00:58:56 So I don't know.
00:58:57 Yeah.
00:58:58 We can, we can, I don't know, we can make it fancy if we want to.
00:59:02 Yeah, just mentioning that I can't do it quick and cheap and fancy.
00:59:07 So it's going to look, it's going to be good.
00:59:10 I'm liking how it's look.
00:59:11 There's a triangle.
00:59:12 There's a triangle.
00:59:13 Do you want, you quick, cheap, fancy, you know, pick two.
00:59:16 I went with quick and cheap.
00:59:18 True.
00:59:19 Yeah.
00:59:20 But yeah, that's, that's a, that's a cool thing.
00:59:25 Currently there's like the punk, the runaway from snakes game.
00:59:29 Being implemented right now.
00:59:31 Do you have any like images of what it's going to look like or?
00:59:38 Mostly I'm excited because it's away from the shitty WordPress thing.
00:59:41 And it's so much more user friendly to upload like new comic pages too.
00:59:47 Did you, was it, was your old website on WordPress?
00:59:50 Yeah, it was a WordPress website because I don't know how to build websites.
00:59:54 And it's so restrictive and so convoluted and terrible and bloated.
01:00:00 And so this new one, I've been given instructions on how to edit
01:00:07 like HTML and, and, you know, add new pages.
01:00:11 Add new pages by simply getting the images and then like naming them correctly,
01:00:18 putting them in a folder that gets uploaded.
01:00:21 And then just editing the data file to say this is a new comic is of this kind.
01:00:29 Like whether it's a long scrolling comic or like a one page at a time,
01:00:33 like one panel at a time, like a bell jpeg comic.
01:00:35 Yeah.
01:00:36 And then like the, the, the image it's referencing,
01:00:39 and it just makes all the pages by itself.
01:00:42 That's, that's very convenient.
01:00:44 Which is going to be very useful for when I have like a billion comics.
01:00:48 Does it, does it make the new web page?
01:00:51 And it makes it so that it like links to the previous page and the next page?
01:00:55 Yeah, there's button stuff.
01:00:56 That's good.
01:00:57 That's really good.
01:00:58 Yeah, I don't know.
01:00:59 It's all, it's all involved.
01:01:00 It's all incorporated.
01:01:01 And the things I would do is like edit like,
01:01:05 like styles of fonts and stuff to taste.
01:01:08 Yeah.
01:01:09 Most of all the functionality is all there and it's, I don't need to touch it and it's great.
01:01:13 That's pretty good.
01:01:14 Yeah. That's a Saint, on Saint comics, when I upload a new page, I have to like
01:01:18 copy paste another page file and just change the like where the links go, you know,
01:01:24 update the new page so that it links to the one before it and the one after it on the next,
01:01:30 on the next links, which is, you know, quite, quite tedious.
01:01:34 So that's, that's a big, that's big.
01:01:37 Yeah. That's, that's cool.
01:01:39 That's cool.
01:01:40 I intend to have like, yeah, all the Clarissa stuff.
01:01:44 And then Bailej2 will go on there and it'll be so simple to upload that it'll make comics
01:01:50 easier as a prospect.
01:01:52 I won't have to think about anything.
01:01:54 I'll just make it and then it's on the website.
01:01:58 It's going to be easier than fucking, I don't know, what, what's the tapas?
01:02:04 I hate that.
01:02:05 Or webtoon or.
01:02:07 I hate tapas.
01:02:08 Microsoft paint, Microsoft paint fan ventures.
01:02:13 If that still exists, probably does.
01:02:16 Yeah, it still exists.
01:02:18 Although I haven't been in a while.
01:02:19 Oh, fuck, I forgot.
01:02:21 I made, I made one of those.
01:02:23 I mean, Beast Pages was one of those.
01:02:26 Do you remember Horstuck?
01:02:28 Oh, vaguely.
01:02:30 Wait, about, about Gib, right?
01:02:31 About like Gib and the horse.
01:02:33 It was Gib.
01:02:33 It was going to be Gib and the horseshoe crew, but in Homestuck, but it didn't get very far in it.
01:02:39 It was just me in my room, fucking around.
01:02:41 There's a few GIFs.
01:02:42 I could put that on there.
01:02:43 That could be like a little secret.
01:02:45 That's, that's your, that's your bard quest.
01:02:48 Yeah, yeah, I've got a multiple bard quest.
01:02:50 I've got, I've got Pocket Boys, the instantly abandoned Nuzlocke comic.
01:02:56 Right, right, right, right.
01:02:57 I didn't even get to like the first gym leader.
01:03:00 I instantly.
01:03:00 I was like, yeah, whatever.
01:03:01 I instantly abandoned a Nuzlocke comic once upon a time.
01:03:05 I mean, a long time ago, like before I ever posted online.
01:03:12 But I did make like one page of one of those stick, like stick figures.
01:03:17 Hope I never, hope I never find that.
01:03:20 Yeah.
01:03:20 So there's Canon Story.
01:03:21 There's fucking Pocket Boys.
01:03:24 There's Red Noir.
01:03:26 There's Red Man.
01:03:27 There's Bell Jape.
01:03:28 Clarissa Gunsmoke.
01:03:29 The Lord of Ghosts.
01:03:30 And what did I, what else did I say?
01:03:34 Something.
01:03:35 I said something else.
01:03:37 I posted the picture of the red.
01:03:38 Oh, and the horse stock.
01:03:39 Horse stock can go on there as well.
01:03:41 Secret, secret horse stock.
01:03:43 I posted the picture of the Radcon for Paradise Dojin.
01:03:46 Yeah.
01:03:47 As you can see there, it's a real thing.
01:03:49 I have one of them now.
01:03:52 And I, and I got, and the margin.
01:03:55 We're going to get, we're going to get splashed by the water.
01:03:57 It's coming.
01:03:58 We're going to get splashed.
01:04:00 I also got, yeah, Slime and Punishment.
01:04:01 I got two copies of it in slightly different colors.
01:04:05 And in two slightly different page weights.
01:04:07 And, you know, I went with the firmer page weight.
01:04:09 And I got to say, it's actually, it's actually really big.
01:04:13 It's really big to the point that it's a little bit floppy.
01:04:17 Because like the pages are just so large.
01:04:19 And because it's, it's cut like, you know, it's cut landscape
01:04:22 instead of a vertical.
01:04:23 So it has a short, it has, the spine is on the short side.
01:04:26 So even at like the, I'm going to, I'm going to ask her like,
01:04:29 what if we went like, what if we used like unusually stiff paper?
01:04:35 I might try to order like a test and see like.
01:04:37 Wait, sorry, for the slime?
01:04:39 Yeah, for Slime and Punishment.
01:04:41 It's, it's, you said it was a hardback, but it's still floppy?
01:04:45 No, no, no, no, it's, it's soft cover.
01:04:47 Okay.
01:04:48 It's, it's soft cut.
01:04:49 It's not like, it's, you know, it's, it's floppy.
01:04:52 Like, you know, like a, it's, it's very similar to, um,
01:04:58 the paper quality is very similar to like the, the, the problem sleuth books.
01:05:02 It's just that it's, it's just that it's like
01:05:04 much bigger, like it's, I don't know, eight, eight and a half by 11
01:05:08 is the size of a piece of paper and that doesn't sound that big,
01:05:12 but like the fact that it's like a 250 page book of that size is actually,
01:05:16 it's like quite large.
01:05:20 I'm almost thinking I overdid it on, on the bigness.
01:05:24 Yeah, like a size, like a sheet of A4.
01:05:28 Um, I think that's A4.
01:05:30 Eight and a half by 11.
01:05:32 Yeah.
01:05:32 Wait, I've got a, I've got a measuring thing.
01:05:34 Normal, I mean, in America, that's normal printer paper.
01:05:37 And I think it's probably the same.
01:05:41 Eight and a half.
01:05:41 Well, that's, that's a little bit bigger than my A4 sheet of paper right here.
01:05:46 Eight and a half.
01:05:47 I think I've got like eight.
01:05:48 So it's, you've got an extra half inch by 11.
01:05:52 Oh no, this is, yeah, it's more of a square.
01:05:57 Yeah.
01:05:57 Is it?
01:05:58 Yeah.
01:05:58 A little bit more square.
01:06:00 Oh.
01:06:00 I think.
01:06:01 Huh.
01:06:02 Okay.
01:06:03 Well, um.
01:06:04 This is not A4.
01:06:05 It's a U.S. standard.
01:06:08 Hang on, hang on.
01:06:09 A4 size in inches.
01:06:14 Maybe I'm wrong.
01:06:14 I'm just looking at it.
01:06:15 Yeah, this says A4 is eight, it's eight and a quarter by 11.67.
01:06:21 So I mean, it's pretty close.
01:06:23 Yeah.
01:06:24 Yeah.
01:06:25 Um, you know, U.S. is, yeah, a little bit, a little bit wider and a little bit shorter.
01:06:32 You know what the difference is for?
01:06:35 It's actually, um.
01:06:37 Why would they, why would they do such a thing as to have a different standard of normal paper?
01:06:42 That is, that is stupid.
01:06:44 Same, same with like different plugs.
01:06:47 They, I'm actually, I would have, I would have preferred the book to be, you know, less long
01:06:54 and more tall, but just the fact that the panels were like Twitter sized means they're like
01:07:01 relatively quite wide.
01:07:03 So honestly, having the book be like the proportions of the panel would make it like
01:07:09 really long and it would look really weird as a book.
01:07:11 And so I, I, I stretched it out vertically a little bit just to make it a little more square.
01:07:16 And as a result, there's kind of like some, there's like an inch or two of black space
01:07:20 sort of at the top and bottom of most pages.
01:07:22 It's a little bit of wasted space, but I think it just makes the book a more appealing shape.
01:07:28 Uh, I don't know.
01:07:29 I had to, I had to sort of work, uh, you know, just find the best compromise for page size
01:07:37 and all that.
01:07:37 But anyway, yeah, it's really large.
01:07:39 And so I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask for maybe another sample, uh, with like stiffer paper
01:07:44 and see like, I don't know, does that make it better or does that just like turn it into
01:07:48 cardboard and, or does it, does that cost like twice as much in which case it's probably not
01:07:54 worth it?
01:07:54 The one that I got is like, it's pretty, it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's very similar in, in
01:07:59 quality paper quality to, uh, problem sleuth books, except that the paper, the inner pages
01:08:05 are like coated.
01:08:06 The inner pages are like, not laminated, but they're like UV coated, which makes them,
01:08:13 it, it, it crushes the blacks.
01:08:14 Like when they're like the uncoded pages, the black is kind of gray.
01:08:18 The coated pages are like, the blacks are black and like the pages are mostly black,
01:08:23 like it's black pages with the image set on it.
01:08:25 So like it really needed that, uh, even though it costs more, but that's the price.
01:08:31 Each individual page is coated.
01:08:34 Yeah.
01:08:35 Yeah.
01:08:36 Oh yeah.
01:08:37 I mean, because it's, because it's, um,
01:08:38 Yeah.
01:08:39 Yeah.
01:08:39 Yeah.
01:08:39 It's full, it's full color.
01:08:40 Yeah.
01:08:41 So much.
01:08:41 Yeah.
01:08:42 You want it to be as dark as possible.
01:08:44 Yeah.
01:08:44 That's where, that's where a lot of the, that's where a lot of the printing cost went
01:08:48 is making like every page full color, uh, like coated, you know.
01:08:53 But it had to, it had to be that way.
01:08:56 Uh, I cut, I'm wondering, looking at it, it's so large.
01:09:02 I'm wondering if maybe I could have got away with making it a little smaller
01:09:05 and maybe that would have saved some money.
01:09:11 Yeah.
01:09:11 I think I started building the PDF for a, a bell jpeg book to be around the same size
01:09:18 as the Homestuck and Problem Sleuth books because they felt, they felt good.
01:09:23 Yeah.
01:09:23 So I'm like, I don't need it to be bigger than that.
01:09:25 Yeah, they're a good size.
01:09:29 I don't know, whatever.
01:09:30 It's kind of, it's kind of cool that it's big also.
01:09:34 It's cool that it's big and because I went with this one printer, the prices are not.
01:09:39 This, this printer is like, the price is decent.
01:09:44 The price is decent for like a hundred copies.
01:09:47 And I'm hoping I can sell at least a hundred copies.
01:09:49 I would be, I would be like, all right, cool.
01:09:51 I accomplished my goal if I sell a hundred at, at a hundred copies.
01:09:55 It's cheap enough that I can sell them for what I think is a reasonable price,
01:09:59 which is going to be around the 30 to $35 range plus a little bit of shipping.
01:10:04 And if I go, if I go higher than that though, if I sell like 200 copies,
01:10:07 the price like drops tremendously.
01:10:11 If I could sell 200 copies, I would like double the profit on every individual copy
01:10:16 because it's just that cheap to print in bulk.
01:10:19 So like, wow.
01:10:20 Yeah, it literally is like, it's, it's barely more expensive to print like
01:10:26 300, it's, it's only like 50% more to print 300 copies as opposed to printing 100.
01:10:32 And then it's like, yeah, to, and then to go to 500 is only like, it only,
01:10:36 it only adds like another like 50% on, on that.
01:10:39 So like, yeah, it's really,
01:10:41 it would be, I have to check with, with, with the Amazon thing and like how,
01:10:47 because they don't do bulk, it's just right when somebody buys one.
01:10:51 That's, that's the, that's where the, that's where the profit margin is.
01:10:55 It's in the bulk printing that gives you like the per copy discount.
01:11:02 That's where you find my skills lie more in like just making the, the, the comics.
01:11:09 Oh, not me.
01:11:09 I'm terrible at that.
01:11:10 But marketing, marketing and production, that's, that's where I make my money.
01:11:15 The comic and afterthought, the content meaning what is garbage.
01:11:19 What I mean is like, I would,
01:11:23 it would take so much more effort for me to do all of that extra stuff.
01:11:28 Yeah.
01:11:28 That I would not end up making that much of a profit
01:11:33 as opposed to going through something, some other thing.
01:11:36 The, the, the, the, the fact of the matter is you gotta,
01:11:39 you only have so much energy and so much time to spend and you do,
01:11:43 there is a choice to be made.
01:11:45 How much time do you want to spend?
01:11:48 Yeah.
01:11:49 Looking into production details and getting the work produced and trying to like squeeze
01:11:53 out a higher profit margin by, you know,
01:11:57 such and such versus how much time do you want to be drawing comics?
01:12:01 And I, and I'm going to have to say that, yeah, I probably,
01:12:04 I probably do spend an above average amount of time
01:12:08 on the one side trying to like find the perfect,
01:12:11 the perfect paper coding and the perfect book size
01:12:15 and the perfect like printing, printing company
01:12:18 with the best shipping costs and all that.
01:12:21 And that's a, and that's a compromise.
01:12:23 You gotta, life is a series of choices.
01:12:28 And I made some.
01:12:30 But I just, I don't know if I just find it so satisfying, I find it so,
01:12:35 I think a lot of people would find that kind of thing really tedious and aggravating
01:12:41 and don't get me wrong.
01:12:41 It's, it's not not that, but it's hugely gratifying to, to like find
01:12:49 what feels like a good solution and be like, yes, it's just right.
01:12:53 It's, it's the perfect paper size.
01:12:55 I found a good deal.
01:12:57 I'm, nothing is being wasted here.
01:12:59 I am getting the, I am getting the best return on my investment I could possibly get.
01:13:03 It's a, it's great.
01:13:05 So, you know, yeah, yeah.
01:13:08 When I was on a roll with the Lord of Ghost comic, it did feel good.
01:13:11 Like, if I like get printing, like I bought like label paper that I could print on to.
01:13:17 So I was printing out the labels and sticking them on the envelopes and putting the things in.
01:13:22 I had already pre-drawn the, the doodles that I needed to do.
01:13:28 And then for the signatures, I would just sign them, put them all in.
01:13:31 And then it'd be like a big, huge wheelbarrow of, of comics to put to the post office.
01:13:41 And it was like, it felt good to get through a lot of that.
01:13:45 But it's just a little, it's, it's, it's really mostly the headaches of items being sent back
01:13:53 or just getting destroyed in customs.
01:13:55 Yeah.
01:13:56 And me not really having a, like a proper, like I'm not a business.
01:14:01 I don't have all those funny numbers they need sometimes.
01:14:03 Yeah.
01:14:05 Oh, what a, what a fuck.
01:14:07 What a whole big thing.
01:14:09 Filling, filling out the customs forms for international shipments was always like,
01:14:14 I would, I would get to the post office and then I would have to go and like find the slips
01:14:18 and then spend like an hour standing there, like filling out slips with like,
01:14:22 because they already have the information written on the envelope, but no, you got to
01:14:25 copy the information from the envelope onto the slip and then you give them the slip
01:14:30 and then they have to look at the slip and manually type in what you wrote on the slip.
01:14:36 That seems pointlessly convoluted.
01:14:38 It really, it really does.
01:14:40 It really does.
01:14:41 Like, like when I went to the post office, I had like the Royal Mail like affiliated like
01:14:48 news agents.
01:14:49 I go in there and I have the, I went to the Royal Mail site and I printed out there like
01:14:56 template for stuff.
01:14:58 And so because that's all there and I typed it all up and it's all fine, I signed it.
01:15:03 They just put it in a bag.
01:15:05 They just take it's like, is this for stuff prepaid?
01:15:07 Yes.
01:15:08 Okay.
01:15:09 They just grab it.
01:15:10 So it's like takes like two seconds.
01:15:12 I went to the star, star, star, star.
01:15:15 I went to the star, star, star, star.
01:15:18 Star, star, star, star, star, star.
01:15:20 Star, star, star, star, star.
01:15:23 That's sorry.
01:15:24 That's what I was thinking while you were talking.
01:15:26 While you were talking just now.
01:15:27 I just wasn't listening.
01:15:28 I was thinking of that.
01:15:30 Yeah.
01:15:31 Turtle.
01:15:33 Turtle dreams.
01:15:34 Turtle memes.
01:15:37 Yeah.
01:15:43 You know, yeah, I don't, this is, this is a damn, what I was just saying right there
01:15:48 I know I said it's really satisfying but also it's a little bit depressing to say what I just said
01:15:53 and think of it like, you know, I could spend, I could stand to spend more time actually drawing.
01:16:00 Couldn't I?
01:16:01 I mean, you like what you like.
01:16:02 I think if you, if you enjoy that process, that's not a problem.
01:16:05 It's just, that's just how it is.
01:16:06 Yeah.
01:16:07 I mean, to, I mean, to, I do to a degree.
01:16:10 I do to a degree.
01:16:12 I mean, you know, I don't know.
01:16:14 I feel like, I don't know, I feel like most artists probably spend more time on their actual craft
01:16:21 and, and, and, and find, you know, I don't know.
01:16:24 I feel like a real, a real artist.
01:16:25 I'm just gonna say I'm not a real artist.
01:16:27 I'm a fucking fake.
01:16:27 I'm a fraud.
01:16:28 I'm a phony.
01:16:30 A real artist has like a publisher to like do all that stuff for them because they don't want to think about that.
01:16:37 I would say you're an artist.
01:16:39 You're just not on that Sigma grain set.
01:16:41 You're not gristling in the ground.
01:16:43 I'm not on that Sigma grain set.
01:16:44 I'm off the grind set.
01:16:46 And I mean, me neither, honestly.
01:16:49 I'm not like drawing as much as I really should be if I want to be like
01:16:53 getting enough, throwing enough stuff at the wall to make something stick.
01:16:56 Because I also, like despite like the idea of like self publishing and Amazon and stuff,
01:17:01 it would also be nice if I could go to a publisher and say, here's my thing.
01:17:05 What do you think?
01:17:06 Can this be, can you do it?
01:17:08 Can you put it in your publication?
01:17:11 Yeah.
01:17:11 Yeah.
01:17:13 Oh, you know that.
01:17:16 Oh, I wanted to raise this issue with you.
01:17:20 And I guess there's no reason not to just talk about it on the podcast
01:17:25 about the perfect comic party.
01:17:26 I mean, I think we said that the first issue is just going to be you and me.
01:17:31 But we're going to, after that, we're going to, we're going to make a call for submissions for like
01:17:35 other people to submit stuff.
01:17:36 Yeah.
01:17:36 Right.
01:17:38 Well, I was thinking,
01:17:39 what about, what's, we, I think we need to hammer out and elaborate a like a rights agreement
01:17:49 for that.
01:17:50 Like what rights, what publication rights are we being granted by a someone that submits
01:17:57 and allows their stuff to be print printed and here.
01:18:01 And here, okay.
01:18:02 For instance, for instance, like what if, what if we eventually decide that we want to like
01:18:05 print physical copies of the perfect comic party.
01:18:09 Yeah.
01:18:11 See this, this is what I want to avoid.
01:18:16 Right.
01:18:18 Well, I have some, I have some thoughts.
01:18:19 Like if we were to do that, we would have to do all of that stuff to make it like
01:18:24 sale smoothly and all that.
01:18:26 I was just thinking like, I don't want it to get big.
01:18:29 I don't want to make a whole like thing about it because then you have to do all that stuff.
01:18:32 Fuck you.
01:18:33 What's the point of doing it if it's not going to get big?
01:18:36 I want this to blow up.
01:18:37 I want this to, I want this to change.
01:18:39 Okay.
01:18:39 Now you're right.
01:18:40 You're right.
01:18:40 I just, I just don't like, I just don't like all of that, that, that stuff.
01:18:45 Well here, I don't know if we are going to need to like draft a contract per se.
01:18:52 We might need to, maybe we need to write out some copy and have people just be like
01:18:57 check a box or something.
01:18:59 Uh, I'll look into it.
01:19:01 But here's, here's what I think would be a reasonable, uh, agreement.
01:19:08 I think that it would be, I think that the agreement would be if like, if we publish
01:19:12 your thing in the perfect comic party, we don't take any like of your rights away.
01:19:18 Like, like it's still your content.
01:19:19 You own the comic and you're allowed to publish it in whatever other places you, you choose.
01:19:26 Uh, but you know, by giving us this thing to publish in the perfect comic party,
01:19:31 you do, you know, you give us the right to, you know, it's, you know, it's, it's for,
01:19:37 it's forever a part of this issue of the perfect comic party.
01:19:40 And we do have the right to print that issue, you know, we can reprint that issue,
01:19:45 including the, the comic that you gave to us for it.
01:19:49 And I, and I feel like that's fair.
01:19:52 Uh, yes.
01:19:53 Like, like, like, like we, we can, like you give it to us.
01:19:57 We, we can print it in this collection and we have the right to reprint this collection.
01:20:04 But you still have the right to print your stuff.
01:20:07 Right.
01:20:07 You, you retain rights, all the rights to your stuff and you can print it elsewhere as well.
01:20:12 It's not exclusive, it's not an exclusive agreement.
01:20:14 So you say print, like this is going to be physical.
01:20:19 Oh, well, I'm not, I don't know.
01:20:21 Well, in the option that it is physical, money needs to go into production of it.
01:20:27 So we would sell it.
01:20:28 And then is there like an agreement that they get a cut somehow for that issue?
01:20:38 I don't know.
01:20:39 I was kind of thinking, I was kind of thinking no.
01:20:41 So it's a, it's a, it's a risk.
01:20:44 It's a, it's a, your capital, your, there's a hypothetical capital that you may not get if
01:20:50 you, if you pledge to the, if you put your comic forward for the perfect comic part.
01:20:54 Yeah.
01:20:55 I mean, we're not, we don't have any active plans to do that at the moment.
01:20:59 But I mean, I don't know, what if like, what if it's, what if it's, you know,
01:21:04 enough of a success that we do maybe a dozen of them, and then we want to like print of,
01:21:11 like a, a collected volume of them, right?
01:21:14 Maybe we could print a collected volume that is like, you know, maybe a hundred or so pages of
01:21:19 stuff, 200 pages.
01:21:24 I don't, I don't know.
01:21:24 It's just, it's something we could do.
01:21:28 And I, I would, I would hate to be like a year down the line, I would hate to be like,
01:21:32 hey, this piece, this perfect comic party thing's going pretty well.
01:21:35 We should print it as physical copies.
01:21:37 Oh no, we didn't, we didn't even think about that.
01:21:41 We didn't have any agreement with our artists about like, do we have the right to print
01:21:46 your submissions?
01:21:48 Yeah, that's, that's, it's, it's sensible to get contracts, even if, even if nothing's gonna come
01:21:54 over it, I guess.
01:21:55 I, I think it's a reasonable stipulation to be like, hey, if you give us your comic and you
01:21:59 want us to put it in our publication, okay, we'll do that.
01:22:03 And we, we, you're not handing over any rights of yours, but you do give us the right to,
01:22:11 yeah, to print, to print this stuff.
01:22:13 To print and profit from, yeah.
01:22:18 Okay.
01:22:20 Because I mean, right.
01:22:24 I don't know how these things work normally.
01:22:26 So like, it sounds okay, I guess, as long as they know that that's what it is and they sign it
01:22:30 and they say, yes, I would like that.
01:22:31 I don't mind.
01:22:33 I don't, I don't think it's unfair because like, yeah, if we were to do it print, like, like,
01:22:37 we're responsible for doing all the printing and we're, we're the ones,
01:22:46 and I mean, it's not like it's sold under the pretense that it's our content.
01:22:50 Like it's still your content.
01:22:51 You'll be fully credited for it and all that.
01:22:55 I, I'm not, I don't know, this, I'm not trying to say like,
01:22:59 I mean, the way that it is now, there's no real money on the table for anyone.
01:23:04 You, you're being paid an exposure and so are we because like, we're not selling it.
01:23:11 And if we, if we were to print it later, I don't know, it would be sort of a separate
01:23:15 thing that is like, we're printing, I don't know.
01:23:21 I know, I know what you're saying, like, like, the perfect comic party
01:23:29 is as like a collection, it's, it's more than simply the comics in a line it has,
01:23:36 it will have like, other stuff to it, I guess, like, I don't know how much stuff is not like,
01:23:43 it's going to be like articles and stuff necessarily, yeah, it might be, but like,
01:23:48 like, it's, it's not the exactly the same as the comics individually.
01:23:59 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
01:24:02 It's a, it's a periodical that features submissions.
01:24:07 Uh, I guess, I guess it's, I guess it's basically like,
01:24:12 I think that any, any potential money from sales is at this point hypothetical,
01:24:17 is probably not a huge amount, even if it were to ever materialize.
01:24:23 And furthermore, I just think it's un, it's impractical.
01:24:27 Here's the thing, it's impractical to the point that I think it would stop us from doing it.
01:24:32 If we were to, if we had to maintain some sort of like individual agreement with every individual
01:24:37 submit, submitter, like, okay, if we ever sell this copy of the podcast, of the comic,
01:24:44 you are entitled to, you know, some percentage of the cut of whatever sales are made and we'll
01:24:48 have to calculate that in the future. If we had to do that for every individual submission,
01:24:52 I think we would simply be like, it's too much trouble and we're just not going to do it.
01:24:57 Yes.
01:24:57 So I think, so I think we, I think we need to stipulate, listen, if you give us this thing to
01:25:01 put in the thing, we might print it in the future and we might sell it and it might,
01:25:06 and it will include the thing you gave it to us and you're just, and you're just going to have
01:25:09 to be okay with that. And I, and I feel like it's not unfair.
01:25:13 Sure. I think comment commenters, let me know what you think about that.
01:25:17 If you feel like it.
01:25:18 I think, yeah, very clear contract. I know how contracts usually look.
01:25:25 They're so weird and annoying. And you just assume it's fine to just say yes.
01:25:32 I just have like a little, little explanation.
01:25:36 Uh, like, you know, what you just said, and then yes, no sign here, please, if you want that.
01:25:44 Right. Right.
01:25:47 But I think that's.
01:25:48 But I think that, yes, as long as that's all, that's all good.
01:25:52 We'll just have to figure out a way to like get like an electronic signature or, or just a check box
01:25:59 or, you know, it's something in writing to confirm like, yes, you know, I give you,
01:26:04 I submit my content under this, under this understanding.
01:26:09 I'll have to look into how to, how to do that.
01:26:12 Yeah, I have no idea.
01:26:14 Yeah, I don't, I don't really either.
01:26:15 I suppose that could be something that's on the website.
01:26:22 Like perfect comic party. You click on that.
01:26:24 You see that things are going to be like, submit your comic and then a link to the email
01:26:28 or something.
01:26:30 Yeah, yeah, yeah, under the submission, oh, a submissions page.
01:26:34 Yeah, something like that.
01:26:35 Yeah. Yeah, a submissions page is a good idea.
01:26:38 And on the submissions page, there should be, yeah, like a.
01:26:42 Like, like you type in the information and there would be like a little thing and then
01:26:47 that would create an email to us with, with the, the thing signed and your comic.
01:26:55 Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.
01:27:01 Oh, what if, what if someone, what if someone like submitted someone else's comic
01:27:06 and pretend and, and impersonated them?
01:27:09 Well, if that was the case, hey, I don't know.
01:27:16 How do you verify that the person putting a thing is the person who
01:27:20 has the rights to sign the thing saying that this thing will be the thing?
01:27:25 I guess if that happened, we would probably have to like,
01:27:27 issue an apology and then like, you know, retract that content from like any future,
01:27:32 like reissues of the, of the, of the files.
01:27:37 I'm talking, I'm talking about printing at this point, but like, we can, we can,
01:27:41 we can do all this under the assumption of like, we can, we don't have to think about that right
01:27:46 now. Yeah, we can, we can, we can make all the same, we can have all the same stipulations
01:27:52 about, yeah, like a digital PDF and it's fine. I'm thinking about the future.
01:27:58 No, it's good. It's good to think about the future.
01:28:00 Empire building, empire building.
01:28:02 I'm building my empire. I'm building my Gibb and take empire with the, the, the comics on
01:28:08 Amazon and the, the new website and potentially like a Fire Emblem video after I finished
01:28:15 playing all those games gets, get some new viewers.
01:28:19 You really think, you really think you might make a video?
01:28:22 I mean, the possibility is there.
01:28:25 That would be, I mean, I, I ask because like, do I even dare to hope for such a thing?
01:28:31 Well, I mean, I, I never stopped the, the possibility of making that dark cloud video.
01:28:36 I just have been, you know, I have been playing it in dark cloud too.
01:28:41 Dark cloud and dark cloud too. I was going to play them, get it and make a lore video about
01:28:46 and all of that. But like, and then the Fire Emblem, I mean, initially it was like
01:28:55 the point of that playing all those games is not to make a video,
01:28:59 but the fact that I'm playing all of those games and I'm also streaming the video.
01:29:03 So I have like an archive of all the footage means that it's not out of the realm of possibility,
01:29:10 not that difficult to put together something if I have something to say by the end,
01:29:15 which I probably will. It might just be like a boring like fire and bloom retrospective,
01:29:22 like I've seen like a billion of those. I never click on them because I'm like,
01:29:26 I haven't played them yet. But how interesting could they possibly be? I have no idea.
01:29:31 I don't know. I don't know either. Yeah, I've got a damn actually earlier when we were talking about
01:29:41 about how your visit was in the summer, not in the winter, like I thought that made me realize
01:29:47 like, oh, I guess, I guess making the Mega Man video didn't take quite as long as maybe it took.
01:29:54 That means that means it didn't take as long as I was thinking it took. That means I,
01:29:58 that just makes me feel like, ooh, I really should have had another video out by now. Like,
01:30:01 ooh, I really should be. You're taking a potential good thing. Like, oh, that video didn't actually
01:30:07 take so long. That was quite quick. No, you took it as an opportunity to feel bad about the fact
01:30:11 you've made another video. Yeah, I mean, I thought it took, I guess it took, I remember it thinking
01:30:19 that it took about five months. But I mean, I guess including editing, editing took a little over a
01:30:24 month. Playing the games took a few months. And then I guess it maybe worked a little bit.
01:30:32 Yeah, like the script and the setting up the board and all that. Yeah, it was probably about
01:30:37 five months. But now, ooh, it's been, it's been almost five, it's been about four months.
01:30:44 It's been almost four months since that video came out. And I have not, yeah.
01:30:50 No way, it's been four months. Well, it's been three and, about three and a half.
01:30:53 Yeah, that video came out on November, November 20th. What?
01:30:57 I know. I know. It's really bad. It's really bad. And I have really not
01:31:01 really started. What even was I, oh, I know what I was doing. I was being depressed in January,
01:31:06 that's all. Lol. La-Mow. I have really not- I got my shit together though. My shit is now together.
01:31:13 So epic. No more of that. The hydraulic shit compressor. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think that's what
01:31:23 it's called. But right, that just makes me think, ooh, I should be further along in the process
01:31:29 of my next video. Ooh, I should be cringing a little bit that I haven't gotten more done.
01:31:35 But on the upside, that makes me think, well, maybe the next one won't take that long. Maybe I
01:31:40 can get the next one done in only a month if I put my mind to it. You are playing the battle
01:31:45 network games, which are much longer to play. That's true. And that's, yeah, that's for like a
01:31:51 future. That's me working towards an even further in the future, like my next, next lecture.
01:31:57 Like that's like maybe two videos down the line.
01:32:00 So, I mean, I am putting, yeah, I am putting in work towards that, but that's, but that's not
01:32:05 going to pay off immediately. What I really, what I really need is another video out like in the next
01:32:11 not that long. Just, just so that people that like pledged to my Patreon after the first one,
01:32:17 no like, okay, no, Ben is still making more videos. He's not like, he didn't just make the one and
01:32:22 then he quit the internet and my money is going to nothing. So, you know, I gotta, I gotta get on
01:32:29 that, but I told myself I would go to get on that, but after after I'll get on that
01:32:36 after we get the first, we get the first perfect comic party done, get that published.
01:32:43 And then I'd start the slime and punishment Kickstarter. And then when that Kickstarter is
01:32:46 underway, then I'll be like, okay, well now that can go in the background. And now's the time when
01:32:52 like, all right, let's let's actually get down to brass tacks about my next video.
01:32:58 Yeah, which I, which I think I have, I think I have decided is probably going to be at like a
01:33:02 history of the PCP.
01:33:07 LaMau.
01:33:10 LaMau, lol. Okay. LaMau. Well, I guess that's all I really have to
01:33:16 say about anything. Yeah, my here is like blowing directly on me.
01:33:23 Perfect. One's the other way.
01:33:28 Yeah, I've got a similar, like I've, Clarissa Gunsmoke chapter five, I haven't been drawing because of
01:33:34 website and Amazon stuff. Right. And perfect comic party. It was like after chapter four was
01:33:41 finished, I was like, ah, that was a good bunch of progress. But then there's all these little bits,
01:33:46 all these little bits of things that need to get done. And they all sort of are holding each other
01:33:51 up, not exactly holding each other up, but like, all of them are important and all of them need
01:33:55 my attention. Yeah. So I'm like, I can't really spend like all day drawing. I've got to
01:34:03 figure this stuff out instead. But here you are. But soon, soon I'll be back to getting that stuff
01:34:09 done. That'll be fun. I mean, I really let myself, I really let myself get, get thrown off this past
01:34:17 week with all the various things that, that made me, that made me a rage about the, the RADCON
01:34:25 funds and things. So that didn't, that didn't really help. I didn't really help anything. But
01:34:33 you know, that, that too will be over. That, that too will be a thing of the past soon. One hopes.
01:34:41 Uh, I, I, I, you know, I, I was like, I was about to say that like, I have had to deal with that.
01:34:50 The truth is, I didn't have to deal with that. The truth is, I could have simply ignored it.
01:34:55 Which everyone else does or has been doing. And honestly, at the time, I'm like, why is everyone
01:35:00 else ignoring this? Everyone, nobody else cares. I'm the only one that cares. Everyone hates me.
01:35:06 Uh, everyone's against me and my enemy. Um, and you know, in hindsight, I'm like, I should have just,
01:35:12 I should, I should just, I should also. It's better if it's just not, it's better just not
01:35:17 worry about it actually. Everyone else knows that. And I am the only one that doesn't.
01:35:24 It was a little distracting for me when it was all blowing up and you were all getting mad at
01:35:29 people for not saying anything. I'm like, but I don't know. Like the receipts will come when they
01:35:35 come. I mean, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm trying to do stuff. That's true. Yep. That's true. Yep.
01:35:42 Well, I made, I've made a nuisance of myself and uh, anyway, the next topic is uh,
01:35:52 next topic. Oh, oh, nothing. I actually, actually that's everything. I just want to shout out Prince
01:35:57 Isolation. Prince Isolation was in my stream chat and they mentioned they were doing an Aliyup comic.
01:36:04 Oh. An Aliyup from, from Endless War, little, little adventure she's going on. And I, I,
01:36:11 I read it and it was really good. I hope they post it somewhere other than their discord.
01:36:17 I haven't seen that. The, the person that did the Endless War Aliyup comic
01:36:22 messaged me and asked about like putting the Aliyup comic in
01:36:26 the perfect comic party. And I told them, definitely submit it. We just haven't worked out like what
01:36:31 the submission process is going to be yet, but like when we have it, like, yeah, absolutely. Uh,
01:36:38 yeah. Yeah. So I get fricking uh, the Aliyup like guest, guest, guest art, like side, side stories.
01:36:48 I guess. I got to bring Belle Jape back. I was thinking of, of, um,
01:36:54 was that, wait, Aliyup, your Aliyup was from Belle Jape, right? Yeah. Yeah. I forgot.
01:37:00 What did, well, what did you think? Well, I just thought she's just one of my characters.
01:37:06 Wait a minute. Wait a minute. No, sorry. I'm sorry. I was thinking of Canon Story. She wasn't,
01:37:10 no, she was not in Canon Story. She was from Belle Jape, which is the Pumped one. Yeah. Sorry.
01:37:16 I was, I was mixing the two up. No, no, no. Yeah. She's from the Pumped Belle Jape. Okay.
01:37:20 Yeah. Um, what was I going to say? I don't know. Oh yeah. Yeah. Belle Jape. Belle Jape 2,
01:37:27 I've had ideas of where it could go because they're floating on lava. Spoilers, they're floating on
01:37:32 lava. Right. And I've had many different ideas of where they could float to or what they could have
01:37:37 happen in the larger world. Like, ooh, when does this take place on the timeline? I feel like
01:37:45 originally Belle Jape was just a bunch of bullshit. I was just making it up. I really,
01:37:50 I think I should not focus so much on like pre-planning something like Belle Jape 2.
01:37:57 I should just get into it when I finish with Clarissa. I think I should just draw. I think I
01:38:03 should just hop on, maybe on a stream like I did before. Just. Is that how you did Belle Jape 1?
01:38:11 Yeah. I just, I was on YouTube streaming and I was like, what if I just made it? I made a comic.
01:38:17 You know, I made Canon Story on YouTube and a few like commenters,
01:38:24 chatters were like, oh, do this, do that. I was like, okay, there's only like three people there,
01:38:28 but like, it was enough to get me to think about what happens next. And I was like, okay, let's do
01:38:34 the same thing, but this time let's do color. Let's do a little more effort. And that's
01:38:41 turned into something really fun and good and everyone likes it. So like, yeah,
01:38:45 well, I don't need to, I don't need to change it. Belle Jape 2 is going to be like Belle Jape.
01:38:52 Maybe I could, maybe that's, oh, I'd have to stream more, but like maybe I could do that with
01:39:00 Biscopades, draw it on stream and maybe that could be that. People have mentioned that. I
01:39:03 saw people mentioning that in your Mega Man stream that you should stream. Well, actually,
01:39:08 I can't remember. It was somewhere. Maybe, I don't remember, but maybe somebody said that. Yeah,
01:39:13 I mean, because like, you know, I think I mentioned that if we're putting it in the
01:39:19 magazine or whatever, then that sort of takes away the like panel by panel, what do you call it,
01:39:26 user suggestion element to a certain degree. But maybe a replacement for that would be,
01:39:33 yeah, I draw it live on stream and people can weigh in on it and be like, I'll do this, do that.
01:39:39 And it's sort of a different kind of, hmm, damn, but I hate Twitch though, but I hate being on stream.
01:39:49 But it makes a lot of sense. Maybe I'll think about that. You don't think about that.
01:39:54 Because yeah, it would be a little, I was thinking it would feel weird to be like drawing it
01:40:01 just like, yeah, kind of the whole idea of it was like that it would be user submitted,
01:40:09 user suggestions. So maybe that's the way I could recapture that, even though it's changing the
01:40:15 format up a little bit. Just realizing that my process for bell shape, I'll have to go,
01:40:21 I kind of want to go back and check. I think I unlisted all of those, but I think I didn't
01:40:27 know what the text was. I think I drew the image or made the GIF and I had the idea in my head,
01:40:35 like, oh, punk do this, punk do that. But then afterwards, I would put it on the website and
01:40:40 then come up with something funny to write underneath. That's a pretty good system, I think.
01:40:49 I'm commenting on something, but I'd have to do it pretty soon after I draw it.
01:40:56 If that's how the first one got made, then yeah, why not do it again? Why not do it the same?
01:41:05 Follow more or less the same strategy. Everyone likes the same stuff.
01:41:13 That's right. With the same methodology. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if it worked the first time.
01:41:21 Imagine if Andrew Hussie finished Homestuck and then tried make Homestuck again.
01:41:26 But this time with green aliens that weren't trolls or chairs. I think he probably
01:41:35 would not do that because like, yeah, Homestuck worked once, but you kind of can't do it again.
01:41:44 Well, the same setting. Yeah. Just sort of like funny little cartoon comic about somebody doing
01:41:50 some wacky shit in a little place. Well, that's, I mean, and then it grows in scope. Oh, it's a
01:41:55 perfect formula. You can't go wrong. Did you read Psycholonials? You did read Psycholonials.
01:42:02 Yeah. Yeah. Are you, I can't tell if you're serious, like he should have just done that.
01:42:09 I mean, I think I would have enjoyed reading whatever he did in a comic style,
01:42:17 in a Homestuck problem-sleuth comic style, just because I like the way he comes up with the
01:42:24 comedy with all the little bits. Yeah. And with Homestuck was a lot of the funny dialogue and
01:42:31 heartfelt character stuff, but Problem Sleuth was like, meat and potatoes sort of,
01:42:37 what if there was a comic and it was like this? It's like, I love that, more please,
01:42:43 but there was no more. So you're saying that you think he should have gone back and made
01:42:47 another Problem Sleuth rather than another Homestuck? Yeah, you don't need to do everything
01:42:53 the same, because like the way Act Six sort of deviated into teen melodrama a little too hard
01:43:01 and a little too verbose and like overly, overly big text all the time, so much text,
01:43:09 and it just really wasn't that useful. It really wasn't that interesting.
01:43:13 SpongeBob yelling at the burger meme, you forgot the funny! Definitely. Yeah. I mean, I think I've
01:43:22 said many times that like, yeah, pound for pound, I do have to say Problem Sleuth is a better work
01:43:29 because it wastes less of your fucking time. It just introduces concepts and then just takes them
01:43:35 to that logical extreme in a big finale, which is completely insane compared to what Star says.
01:43:41 The finale wraps it all up so cleanly. It's like so many like things introduced earlier,
01:43:47 it all comes first full circle and they come back and the scope gets bigger and bigger and
01:43:52 bigger and then it all comes together in the end remarkably, remarkably clean in a way that Homestuck
01:43:58 did not manage, I'm sorry to say, but yeah. You know, I liked Psycholonials. It was definitely
01:44:06 not that. Yeah, it was, I liked it. It was, I thought the ending was a bit dumb, but you know.
01:44:16 Basically what I'm saying is the Beljapes- Moment to moment, I thought it was enjoyable.
01:44:19 Beljapes Problem Sleuth and I'm doing Problem Sleuth now. I'm the one who does it.
01:44:23 Right. Beljapes Problem Sleuth and Clarissa is Homestuck?
01:44:28 Is Whistles the Clown. Right, yeah. What if Andrew Hussey made another Whistles?
01:44:36 What if he continued Whistles? That would be pretty good.
01:44:39 That would be amazing. That would actually be- That would require him to sit down and do something.
01:44:46 Yeah, true. I mean, his comics were really good. Like, the art in Whistles is like really nice.
01:44:54 Yep. So, I think a lot of people would probably really appreciate that.
01:44:58 I mean, a lot of his core fans would probably be like, oh my god, Whistles 3?
01:45:08 That kind of seems like a Hussey thing to do, actually, is just surprise everyone by just
01:45:12 picking up an old idea that everyone thought was completely abandoned and being like,
01:45:16 yeah, I fully committed to it and I finished it while no one was looking.
01:45:21 He says he'll be coy about like, I'm coming back to a thing and everyone think it'll be Whistles,
01:45:27 but then it's BardQuest. Yeah. He'll fully finish BardQuest and everyone will be like, oh, okay.
01:45:34 Okay, cool. Thanks. I appreciate it. That would be a Hussey thing to do.
01:45:41 I was really wondering what the Bard was going to do next. Now I know. Yeah.
01:45:47 This is going to level up. I'll take what I can get.
01:45:53 Fun fact. This is obvious, but I don't know if people even think about it.
01:45:58 Belljape sounds like jailbreak. True. That's why it's like that.
01:46:06 Okay. I know that. I was aware of that.
01:46:10 All the people who minds blown, say so in the comments. Say that your mind was blown if it was.
01:46:20 All right. You finished typing? You finished typing down there? All right. Thank you.
01:46:27 The only other thing I did this week was I made bombed hands, esteemed hands meme.
01:46:33 Yeah. I saw that. I don't know. I think it was just sort of like, it was in the
01:46:39 thralls of all of the bullshit and I just needed something to distract me.
01:46:43 Right. And I thought of the funniest idea. I don't know why this made me buckle over,
01:46:51 on the floor. I lost all of the breath when I made esteemed hands,
01:46:57 but it was lamp oil, rope and bombs where the things being discussed.
01:47:02 Yeah. I watched it and I was like,
01:47:05 it's so basic. This doesn't really, this doesn't really track.
01:47:10 Esteemed lamp oil.
01:47:14 It just, it killed me. I don't know why. Even just thinking about it.
01:47:19 You just love lamp oil and rope and bombs. Just admit that you just like those things.
01:47:24 I don't need to admit it. I say that all the time. It's not a secret.
01:47:29 Okay. Good.
01:47:31 I love, I love, I think something about it. It's a very basic idea. It's like the default
01:47:41 bread, but I haven't seen it before. And something about it being such a basic idea,
01:47:48 taking two memes and putting them together, but like not in a smart way, not in a,
01:47:54 and it's not an effort shitpost. It's truly the laziest little joke.
01:48:01 It just completely destroys me, especially the super bit crushed.
01:48:09 From like 14 years ago, I downloaded the lamp oil, rope and bombs line,
01:48:14 like the original upload. And it's like 240p, 144p sound quality.
01:48:24 Ah, can't go wrong. Can't go wrong with lamp oil.
01:48:32 Gigi, you can't and you didn't. And you know, I watched the video and I just kind of like
01:48:38 had my fingers steepled in front of me and I'm just nodding like mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm,
01:48:44 yep, lamp oil, rope, bombs, got it, got it.
01:48:48 I think as well, the fact that it's not that funny to other people makes it funny.
01:48:58 It took, and it took a while, and it took a while for like the lamp oil, rope and bombs to even
01:49:03 count. So it's like the first minute I'm just kind of like, when's, when's the, when's the joke?
01:49:09 Like the first time he is like, but what if I were to purchase bombs? That's the first time
01:49:15 it happens. Yeah. And then it's just normal for so long. And then he says, oh, that's the steamed
01:49:20 rope. It's just it takes such a long time for the second one.
01:49:27 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, no, I, I,
01:49:35 you're making me, you're, I'm, I'm laughing, I'm laughing at the thought of how much you enjoy
01:49:43 making it. I know. I think I enjoy the fact that I enjoyed making it, which makes it funnier.
01:49:50 It's like multiplicative. Right, right, right. I think I piqued the mic a couple times there.
01:49:55 That's not so good. That's good. That's fine. Uh, LeMau, uh, well. Oh, that I needed that one.
01:50:05 That's what I needed in my life. Uh, how's, uh, how's Runescape? Oh, I'm glad you asked.
01:50:14 Yeah. Runescapes go in great. I have gotten, uh, I've been mining coal and adamantite ore
01:50:23 in just, just, you know, casually while I rewatch on cinema at the cinema again.
01:50:28 Uh, love that series. I talked about that before. I said I may have done, I may,
01:50:35 there's one of the potential lecture subjects that I could have talked about.
01:50:39 Oh, wait. What was it? On cinema at the cinema. Oh, god, I've been meaning to watch that for years.
01:50:46 Yeah. It's the Tim Heidecker, like fake movie review show turned into like, you know, drama,
01:50:54 like, like real drama, like big joke. It's fun. Uh, there's not a good explanation of what it is,
01:51:01 but, uh. I know that like, it involves like, like they had like characters and they would
01:51:06 like tweet in character. They, yeah, Tim Heidecker and Greg Tarkington using their real names play
01:51:12 two movie reviewers, um, who are both have terrible taste in movies. Uh, one of them is a
01:51:21 pretentious snob about how much, despite not knowing that much, and the other one
01:51:26 is an arrogant, uh, egomaniac who thinks that he deserves everything in the world
01:51:32 for his shitty show that's terrible. Um, and they hate each other, but they need each other
01:51:39 and they just continually make this show and they have like the, the highlights are the,
01:51:45 the Oscar specials where they do a live stream. Every Oscars, I guess they'll be doing one,
01:51:50 like this year, but it might be behind a paywall. I think they've paywalled stuff.
01:51:55 That's a, that's a certain, a certain point. They stopped posting like publicly. You gotta
01:52:00 subscribe to a thing to see new episodes. And I'm like, eh, whatever. I'm, I can't be bothered for
01:52:07 that. Um, but the, the, the, the on cinema live specials, live Oscar specials where the Oscars
01:52:15 is happening and they live stream a movie show, like discussing the Oscars and who's gonna win.
01:52:23 And, uh, it's just a big farce. It's an opportunity for Tim to like get drunk or like fake drunk.
01:52:32 He does drink actual booze, I think, but he's like faking being like a real,
01:52:37 like a abusive like guy who like shouts at people and throw stuff and trashes the place.
01:52:45 And it's just great. It's just, it's just really fun. I, and it's, it's really fun, especially
01:52:53 during the live broadcasts, because you can, you can notice moments where like the characters break
01:53:00 and they can't stop laughing. They really try to hold it in. They never like completely break,
01:53:04 but there's like moments where Tim or Greg, they're like, they try and stifle a laugh because
01:53:09 it's so absurd what's happening. I, my friend of mine was telling me about it and he said that
01:53:15 there's like, he said that there's a timeline somewhere. There is. There's a, yeah. It includes
01:53:24 like their, their, like their, cause it includes like out of show stuff, like their tweets and
01:53:28 stuff that are kind of like part of it. Uh, and, and I don't know what else is involved, but it's
01:53:33 like, yeah, they started as a little podcast. I think it was a podcast of like a basic idea of
01:53:41 like, what if two guys have a really half-assed movie review show, whether they don't have anything
01:53:46 to say at all and they would record it on their phone whenever they were together, just as like a
01:53:52 little bit and then people liked it. So they continued it into, until it became a show.
01:53:59 God, how many seasons, season nine, the trial, season 10, season 11, that only goes to 2019,
01:54:08 this timeline. I know they, I know they've done, I'm pretty sure they've done more.
01:54:16 I guess I'll, it's an, it's an outdated timeline.
01:54:21 But yeah, after season 11, they sort of had their own website where they would post episodes
01:54:30 and stuff. And so I guess, because Adult Swim was not backing it as much,
01:54:37 they couldn't, they, they couldn't really keep doing the stuff unless they had the money. So
01:54:42 fan funded from that point, I guess. But they, they, they do it in universe where Tim is like
01:54:49 a grifter, like an Alex Jones type, like trying to get your money.
01:54:53 Selling brain pills, yeah. Yeah, all that sort of stuff. He plays all those sorts of like,
01:55:00 like nasty people roles. And it's fun. Yeah. But anyway, that's what I've been doing.
01:55:09 It sounds, it's all, yeah, it sounds really cool. And I've been meaning to, I've been meaning to
01:55:12 watch it. People told me about it years ago and I was like, oh, that sounds really cool. That
01:55:15 sounds really interesting. Oh, what an avant-garde work of postmodern deconstruction.
01:55:25 Where is it? Can I share the playlist? What a, what a deconstruction of the way that the modern
01:55:33 media is disseminated, popular culture. Right. This is on cinema, Decker, Decker and Decker.
01:55:43 Decker is like a, like a, a James Bond, like a Tim High Decker is James Bond kind of guy.
01:55:53 Well, not James Bond. He would hate that. He's just, he's just so short. They're like two minutes
01:55:56 long. These are the podcasts at the beginning. You can scroll down to the first episode. You
01:56:01 might want to start with those. This is just the playlist that has everything in it.
01:56:04 And yeah, on cinema season one, episode 101, the first few seem to be out of order.
01:56:12 These podcasts are two minutes. I'll just, I'll, why not listen to them as well?
01:56:15 There's like 50 of them, but yeah, you can listen to them, get an idea of it.
01:56:21 I recommend that the time investment. I assume these are in chronological order.
01:56:28 Yeah. There's a few that look like they're out of chronological order,
01:56:31 but they are not. I double checked. Okay. Something about the, the titling was wrong,
01:56:36 but yeah. Right. I'm gonna, this is good. Thanks for the link. I'll probably,
01:56:42 probably watch this or watch this or wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
01:56:49 Okay. Hang on. Some of these are dated that they're seven years ago, but maybe they were like
01:56:53 posted seven years ago, but they're actually older than that. They are a bit older than that.
01:56:57 Okay. Okay. I think the, the show started in like 2012.
01:57:02 Yeah. And the podcast was before that. So the podcast was not uploaded to YouTube till later.
01:57:08 It was an iTunes podcast. Little iTunes show. Gotcha.
01:57:16 But yeah, I've been, I've been re-watching this while I play RuneScape. I have now
01:57:23 2,759 adamantite ore, which is what I need for my fletching challenge. So I no longer need
01:57:31 Addy. And now I just need, I need 160,000 more coal. I'm just going to mine some coal for a long
01:57:41 time. Oh, and I've hit level 92 mining. That's a big milestone. Apparently-
01:57:48 Max? No, Max is 99, but the, because of the way, excuse me, because of the way that
01:57:59 the, the experience like escalates, what's the word, over time, it's a-
01:58:07 The progression or-
01:58:08 Exponential. It's an exponential curve. The halfway point from level one to 99 is level
01:58:14 92, apparently. I see, yeah. So I'm halfway there. Gotcha.
01:58:20 I think I will get beyond the experience for 99 getting all of this coal.
01:58:25 Are the benefits also like exponential? Like is it like a, is it a significantly big jump from like
01:58:32 level 92 to level 93? Like in terms of what it actually gives you?
01:58:38 Not really. There's, on the, on the wiki, there's a little graph that shows you the,
01:58:45 the percentage chance to mine a particular rock every tick, every game tick at specific mining
01:58:54 levels. And for the more difficult to mine things, even at level 99, it only gets as high as like
01:59:00 20%. But for some things, you can get to a like 100%, like iron ore at a certain point
01:59:07 is 100%. Like every game tick you click on it, you instantly get it. So it's, it's really not
01:59:13 that useful to get to level 99 for most people, other than like bragging rights and for the
01:59:21 few occasional very, very high skill requirement things. So it's not so much you are good at
01:59:27 mining. It's that you can physically mine certain things that other people can't.
01:59:34 Like amethyst. I can mine amethyst now, but it's, I'm not a member.
01:59:37 But it doesn't make you better at mining the things you could already mine.
01:59:41 It does, but just not, not that much. I see. Okay.
01:59:45 So like getting from level 91 to 92 is like one experience, a one percentage chance increase
01:59:53 for like coal. Right. But it, but it takes like 10 times as much experience to get that extra one
02:00:00 percent. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like a thing you need to do. That's why, that's why RuneScape is
02:00:06 stupid, but I love it. Sure. It's so pointless. I think the best, I mean, the best games are
02:00:13 a little bit like fucked up. If everything, if everything is like perfectly balanced and perfect,
02:00:21 it's like the games, like you can't make a game like that. That's not like kind of boring.
02:00:27 A system that's totally, well, even chess, you know, who goes first, white or black, you know,
02:00:33 it's not perfectly balanced. That's probably not, that's probably not actually true,
02:00:38 but a lot of the time, you know, a game being unbalanced or like weird.
02:00:44 It's not so much that it's unbalanced. It's just that the time sink and the way you get
02:00:50 the experience in old school RuneScape was so, it was just so tedious that most people
02:00:58 wouldn't bother, which kind of made it so much more prestigious of a thing to get to the maximum
02:01:07 skill. Yeah. Because you have to be kind of insane to bother. Yeah. I feel, yeah. I feel, yeah.
02:01:14 Yeah. So it's like, yeah, like no normal person is going to go for 99.
02:01:21 Yeah. And even beyond that, there's loads of people on YouTube who do like extreme
02:01:26 challenge runs of like many different types to like hand cuff themselves in like ridiculous
02:01:38 fashions. Have I talked about Settled before? I think I have. I mentioned his like Mauritania
02:01:45 locked. Oh, yeah, you've mentioned them. Yeah. But there's other ones where like you, there's like a
02:01:52 lot of people who like stick to a chunk and they have to perform some sort of action within that
02:01:59 chunk or every action possible within that chunk before they can unlock a different chunk. And
02:02:05 a chunk is just sort of a loaded like grid square of like a bunch of like at some distance.
02:02:13 You know, like in Minecraft, they have chunks. You mean blocks?
02:02:18 Not blocks, but like biome chunks? Chunks that are like loaded in. So like if you are in one
02:02:26 chunk, it sort of loads one chunk at a time. So if you walk towards something, the whole
02:02:33 chunk will load at once. It's just like an area of 250 something squared grid on the ground.
02:02:43 Gotcha. But anyway, you have like accounts that are built to be stuck in a particular
02:02:49 chunk and have to try and figure out how to either gain enough experience doing the like
02:02:55 really inefficient methods of gaining experience that exist in that chunk to achieve some kind of
02:03:02 goal for themselves. Like people take RuneScape, an already tedious game, and make it far more
02:03:09 tedious and they love it. And I love watching it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you're there to,
02:03:18 if you're there for the tedium, if you're there, if that's if you're there to grind.
02:03:24 It's the grindiest game there ever was. The Sigma grind set. No, it's something
02:03:32 higher. The Ligma grind set. There you go. That's when that's when you love that's when you're
02:03:43 such a hustler that you grind just for the sake of grinding. You're not even getting anything out of
02:03:48 it. You're not even making any money. You're not winning anything. The true grind is just for the sake
02:03:56 of the grind. You love toil. Yes, you love toil so much. We're all house elves over here.
02:04:02 We just love it. We love being enslaved and toiling forever. It's what we want. Please don't give me
02:04:09 the sock. Don't give me the sock or I'll give you the cock. You read Harry Potter, right?
02:04:17 Yeah, it's a little bit of a cultural juggernaut when I was the perfect age to be reading it.
02:04:23 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I read, I read the first book I read, actually, it was the first book I
02:04:28 could read by myself without parents is the first Harry Potter book. I was reading, I was reading
02:04:35 Animorphs. I was reading Animorphs before Harry Potter. I think, I think, yeah. But I read Dita
02:04:45 Jackson's review of the Hogwarts legacy. And they said, you know, of course, I read the
02:04:54 damn books. Everybody read the damn books. That was my age at that time. And
02:05:02 their, their, their review on polygon was really good. I liked it. I watched Yahtzee's,
02:05:08 I watched a zero punctuation for the first time in a long time. I watched Yahtzee's review of
02:05:13 Hogwarts legacies. Oh, yeah. Also, the long story short, the game is, everybody seems to,
02:05:24 everybody seems to agree on the things that are not that good about the game. And it's just that
02:05:29 it just kind of feels like a very sort of like flat and not really that deep or immersive. It's
02:05:36 an open world, but it's all just kind of like, I don't know, people seem to think it's not that,
02:05:40 it's not that magical. It's all, it's all, it's all just kind of by the numbers.
02:05:46 Yeah. Very, well, what do they say? Gita said like, you know, like in the, in the context,
02:05:54 like they, they, they tried to make legacy as unrolling as possible. They tried to divorce
02:06:00 it as much as they could from like, you know, they put it, they put a trans character in there.
02:06:06 They made, they gave it a bunch. I mean, I saw the trans character and I thought it was like,
02:06:13 I don't know. Well, what was the, what was the name of the trans character? It was like,
02:06:17 yeah, they had some, some, some male sounding name. It was like a mean spirited sort of joke.
02:06:24 Like, well, we'll, we'll give you a trans character like that. I didn't, it didn't feel
02:06:28 right, but I didn't care. Well, I'm not sure. I'm not really sure what the mindset was there,
02:06:33 but I, I don't know. Gita said that it felt like they tried to divorce it from that and they tried
02:06:38 to make it more inclusive. They put more, you know, they put more like people of color. They put
02:06:42 more like, they put, I think there's like Indians or there's like people from Africa and stuff
02:06:47 in, in there. And it's like, okay, cool, I guess, but it kind of just, it kind of just serves to
02:06:53 remind you that the books aren't like this. Like, like it's actually kind of weird that the, that
02:06:59 the game is like so much more like diverse and inclusive when it's set in like 1885. And then
02:07:05 you read the books that are set in like, you know, the nineties or whatever. And it's like,
02:07:11 where did all the minorities go? It just makes you wonder like, what happened?
02:07:17 There were minorities in the books. There's a, there's a hand, there's a handful of them.
02:07:21 There's a handful of them. There's a hand full of them. There's a hand full of them. There's a
02:07:21 hand full of them. There's a hand full of them, Xiao Cheng. There's a, I, there's a handful.
02:07:26 Yeah. That's what you get. That's what you get. When you get Xiao Cheng, there's like,
02:07:32 okay, there's like two black kids. There's a, there's the one who is like,
02:07:39 the, the Gryffindor announcer kid. I forgot his name. Tom B NZ.
02:07:46 No, he has an Irish name.
02:07:53 Sean Finnegan, I thought that was the white boy in the film.
02:07:56 No, that's not Seamus.
02:07:58 Oh, Seamus, yeah.
02:07:59 There's Seamus Finnegan, but that's not who I'm that's not who I'm thinking of.
02:08:04 People of Colored Future and Harry Potter.
02:08:06 What's the he's a Gryffindor kid.
02:08:09 And in the movie, it was Thomas something or like Derek.
02:08:12 Dean Thomas, Dean Thomas.
02:08:14 Yes. Yes.
02:08:15 See, I didn't I didn't even realize he was black reading in the books,
02:08:18 but like he might have been like, you know, fair enough.
02:08:22 There was another there's a there's a there's a Slytherin kid named Blaise
02:08:26 Zabini, who is mentioned completely offhand like once.
02:08:30 And then in like book six, he has like one interaction with Harry.
02:08:34 There's Cho Chang, there's the Patel sisters.
02:08:37 There's Oh, no, it's Lee Jordan.
02:08:40 No, wait, hang on.
02:08:41 OK, Lee Jordan and Dean Thomas are both black in the movies.
02:08:45 And I think maybe only one of them is mentioned to be black in the books.
02:08:48 And I didn't even notice something like that.
02:08:53 Right. But it's literally like a handful of characters.
02:08:56 Did I did I mention those?
02:08:58 Oh, and of course, and who could forget who could forget Kingsley Shacklebolt?
02:09:04 Yes, the weirdest fucking name.
02:09:07 Yeah. And then in the movie, they give him that.
02:09:11 They give him that hat.
02:09:12 I don't know, something something weird about Kingsley Shacklebolt.
02:09:18 Yeah, but he's a bad ass.
02:09:20 But he's kind of a bad looks cool.
02:09:22 And he's a he's a he's a.
02:09:24 I don't know. I think he's fucking stupid.
02:09:26 It looks dumb. It's probably insensitive of me.
02:09:29 But in the but it's not like a traditional African sort of guy.
02:09:33 Yep. Yeah, probably.
02:09:35 Well, that's what that's weird, though.
02:09:36 Isn't that weird that they gave that they made the one black adult?
02:09:40 They gave him this like freak.
02:09:41 They gave him like a freaking African.
02:09:43 It's like they put him in that, you know, that orange, like patterned fabric
02:09:48 that that all the fricking Democratic senators wore when they knelt
02:09:53 on the Senate floor that one time during the BLM thing.
02:09:57 I don't know what that is at all.
02:09:59 Hang on, senators kneeling African cloth.
02:10:07 Here we go. Found it. First result.
02:10:10 Senators kneeling the Kente cloth, the Kente cloth.
02:10:14 And I don't know what it is.
02:10:15 I just know it's an African thing.
02:10:17 I mean, African clothing is like very colorful and cool.
02:10:22 Sure.
02:10:24 It's oh, no.
02:10:27 It's just a bit.
02:10:28 I don't know. It's just a bit weird that there's one black adult
02:10:31 and there's one named black adult and they gave him this like traditional
02:10:34 African garb.
02:10:36 Like, why isn't he just dressed like a wizard, you know?
02:10:40 Maybe he's nobody else.
02:10:41 Where's that hat?
02:10:42 Maybe he's from Africa and they have different ways.
02:10:45 Well, maybe he.
02:10:46 Well, maybe he is.
02:10:48 I mean, it's fine.
02:10:49 It's fine the way he looked.
02:10:51 But it's fine.
02:10:52 Blaze Zabini doesn't wear a hat.
02:10:55 So it's OK, I guess.
02:10:57 I'm talking about the I don't know
02:11:02 if I mentioned on the podcast before, but I remember reading that, you know,
02:11:09 JK Rowling in one of her many moments, I forget which moment she was just
02:11:15 doing some stuff and just getting controversy and controversy and stuff
02:11:19 could have just been general.
02:11:21 But the people, you know, the actors of Harry Potter, they were like,
02:11:25 yeah, we don't like what JK Rowling is saying.
02:11:27 But the ones that defended her saying, this is outrageous.
02:11:31 You can't attack a woman for being a woman or whatever the fuck they said.
02:11:35 Right.
02:11:36 Right.
02:11:36 And they're just defending her.
02:11:38 I don't even think they knew too much, but like it was funny to me.
02:11:42 It was amusing that there was the actors for Bellatrix Lestrange
02:11:47 and Lord Voldemort.
02:11:48 Those are the only ones.
02:11:51 The villains.
02:11:52 I think Luna Lovegood, too.
02:11:54 Oh, no.
02:11:55 Yeah, no.
02:11:56 I think I saw Luna Lovegood saying,
02:11:59 hey, she's just she's just defending women's spaces.
02:12:04 She's just speaking up for the right of women to have male free spaces.
02:12:10 What do you want them to be raped?
02:12:14 Stop it.
02:12:14 Yes, leave her alone.
02:12:17 Yes.
02:12:20 Do it.
02:12:22 It's just so I love sexual assault.
02:12:26 Hmm.
02:12:27 As a as a leftist, as a radical leftist, I do love sexual assault.
02:12:34 Clip that. Clip that, everybody.
02:12:39 But yeah, that's been playing the Fire Emblem and the play in the RuneScape.
02:12:44 Oh, and I continued watching Utena, which is good.
02:12:49 And also.
02:12:52 Star Trek, the next generation.
02:12:55 I'm just watching that every so often now.
02:12:58 Put on an episode of Star Trek.
02:13:00 Yeah, the good old that I never watched the entire show before.
02:13:03 I've seen like bits on TV.
02:13:04 So I'm like, fuck it.
02:13:07 Same. I like filling.
02:13:09 I feel I like filling the hours with good stuff instead of crap.
02:13:14 Yeah, I've seen a bunch of episodes that I used to just catch one here and there on
02:13:20 on TV sometimes.
02:13:22 I think I've mentioned that like when I was a little kid and I would see it was
02:13:26 the next generation, usually, I would I would sometimes catch the show when I
02:13:31 stayed up late and I would be like, when are they going to get like where they're going?
02:13:38 Like, is there an episode later where like,
02:13:41 we made it, we made it.
02:13:42 Yeah, we got to Earth or we got to.
02:13:45 I mean, I guess in Voyager, they are literally like trying to get back to Earth.
02:13:49 Or no, no, Deep Space Nine is that one of them is like that.
02:13:53 The Enterprise.
02:13:56 I think it's just called the Enterprise.
02:13:58 I don't know. I don't know Star Trek.
02:13:59 I've never watched Star Trek.
02:14:01 But they the first episode, they're just going.
02:14:06 They're leaving Earth and they they have like Q appears and he's like,
02:14:10 huh, humans, you suck.
02:14:13 And they're like picked hearts like no.
02:14:16 Wait, they're leaving Earth in the first episode.
02:14:19 They're they're yeah, they're leaving Earth and they're going to go out to explore
02:14:24 and see stuff. That's the the idea.
02:14:26 And Q is there saying humans are so war like and monstrous.
02:14:30 I'm here to stop you.
02:14:32 I'm here to tell you to go back or perish and then Picard convinces him with a
02:14:36 speech that actually humans have evolved beyond the war from the past.
02:14:43 And we're good now.
02:14:44 We're Star Trek.
02:14:46 And everyone says Star Trek.
02:14:48 And then Q is like, you will not stand between us and our trek through the stars.
02:14:54 Our Star Trek.
02:14:56 And everyone said, oh, my God, he said it.
02:14:59 Q said, hmm, that would be okay, but I'll be keeping an eye on you, little boy.
02:15:05 And then he disappeared.
02:15:06 And that's the first episode.
02:15:08 And so the idea is beyond that.
02:15:11 I guess they're just going out into the world.
02:15:13 Yes, as an explorer exploratory just seeing seeing what's going on.
02:15:18 He says at the beginning of every episode, what, you know, seek seek out new life
02:15:23 and new new frontiers.
02:15:26 Yeah, yeah, classic classic.
02:15:29 That space is so big, you guys.
02:15:31 So I really what's in there?
02:15:33 I really should have paid attention and maybe I wouldn't have had that expectation then.
02:15:37 But is it the first episode?
02:15:40 I think it's no, I think it's I think it's like most episodes start with
02:15:44 or maybe they end with that narration.
02:15:46 He says that a lot.
02:15:48 I think it does start that before like the song comes in.
02:15:52 It's either.
02:15:58 It's either Deep Space Nine or Voyager that like the premise of the show is
02:16:03 like there's a warp malfunction and they end up stranded somewhere like far from
02:16:08 the Federation and it's like the show is about like them trying to
02:16:13 trying to survive on their way back.
02:16:15 Yeah, I don't I thought Deep Space Nine was like a space station rather than a ship.
02:16:22 Oh, I think so.
02:16:23 They deal with the comings and goings of different people.
02:16:26 Yeah, but they are stationary, generally speaking.
02:16:29 It's probably Voyager.
02:16:31 That's the we have to get back.
02:16:34 Back to the future.
02:16:36 So there's the Star Trek, then there's the next generation, meaning
02:16:41 and we're doing Star Trek again.
02:16:43 I think original Star Trek is just we're just going out and going out.
02:16:46 Fine stuff. Yeah, I'm thinking of the subtitle.
02:16:48 So like
02:16:50 so Star Trek and then Star Trek, the next generation, AKA Star Trek.
02:16:54 But we did it at second time as smarter, smarter this time.
02:16:58 Then Star Trek Deep Space Nine was next,
02:17:01 which is takes place on a deep space, the ninth one.
02:17:04 And then Star Trek Voyagers were voyaging.
02:17:09 Star Trek.
02:17:10 Was that it?
02:17:11 There was another one, wasn't there?
02:17:14 I mean, I think Star Trek Expedition, Star Trek,
02:17:19 Travel Agency and Star.
02:17:24 I mean, I'm I know there's like later ones, like there's that animated one.
02:17:29 And I think there's one.
02:17:30 Well, I'm thinking of the before before it got reinvigorated with like J.J. Abrams
02:17:36 movies and stuff. Wait a fucking second.
02:17:38 There was an animated series between the original series and next generation.
02:17:43 What? What the fuck?
02:17:45 Yeah, I'm animated in what way.
02:17:47 What do they look like? Is it like Thundercats?
02:17:50 I said like kind of.
02:17:53 Yeah, it looks like this.
02:17:56 You know, I've seen these care.
02:17:57 I've seen these drawings before.
02:17:59 Wait, yeah, I've seen I've seen the one where it's like like Spock.
02:18:03 He's like putting his face over his hand.
02:18:05 Or he's like hand over his face like yeah.
02:18:09 OK, well, I forgot about that.
02:18:11 There's the original series, the animated series, the next generation,
02:18:14 Deep Space Nine Voyager Enterprise.
02:18:18 Well, what the remember that just as you were saying what what happens.
02:18:21 Well, OK, there's Enterprise and then like
02:18:23 13 years later, they made Discovery.
02:18:26 And I think that's kind of when the yeah.
02:18:28 What is it? What is Enterprise?
02:18:30 Enterprise, I don't know.
02:18:32 I've just heard of it.
02:18:33 I only know Star Trek through Mike's The Class and Rich Evans.
02:18:38 And they have talked about all the shows a little bit.
02:18:40 Follows the adventure of the first crew of the Starship Enterprise.
02:18:44 Who's the who's who's the captain?
02:18:47 Is it Archer, Jonathan Archer?
02:18:49 Jonathan Archer, yeah, it was a guy.
02:18:52 Voyager was a lady.
02:18:55 I've like literally never seen this guy before.
02:18:58 Played by Scott Bakula. OK.
02:19:00 More like yeah, Voyager is Janeway.
02:19:04 Janeway, and I think I think the people's
02:19:07 impression of Janeway is that she's sort of like a
02:19:10 she's sort of a loose cannon, like she sort of like breaks protocol.
02:19:14 Just when she feels like it.
02:19:18 That's what I've heard people say about her is that she's kind of a renegade.
02:19:25 In a way that like, like, you know,
02:19:27 freaking Picard would be like he would like, you know, he would he would call a
02:19:31 freaking council and be like, let's have a vote on like what the what the
02:19:35 Federation would want us to do in the situation.
02:19:37 And Janeway will just be like, damn, damn the the the the prime director.
02:19:44 We're all going to die. Get out. Fire the torpedoes.
02:19:48 I might be completely.
02:19:49 Shoot everybody you see.
02:19:50 Don't even don't don't wait for my command.
02:19:52 I might don't even wait for my command.
02:19:54 I might be wrong about that.
02:19:55 That's just what I feel like I've picked up through the grapevine.
02:20:00 You have. Yeah, I'm enjoying enterprise.
02:20:02 I really, really like.
02:20:04 Every time I see the next generation,
02:20:06 I'm like, that is the coziest place I've ever seen that that set.
02:20:11 Yeah.
02:20:12 Like the fact that the new shows are so dark.
02:20:15 I'm like, yeah, but like life is dark.
02:20:18 Turn the lights on.
02:20:20 I want to see that that well lit, soft lighting, carpeted space adventure.
02:20:27 It's the sort of thing I can curl up with a mug of cocoa and watch.
02:20:31 Those set, you know, say what you want about Star Trek, the next generation.
02:20:35 But those sets.
02:20:36 Well lit, very professionally lit.
02:20:40 Oh, oh, it's lit.
02:20:43 All right. Oh, it's lit.
02:20:45 I can see every I can see every detail of that blinking control panel.
02:20:51 It's funny.
02:20:52 It's funny how they have the same sets and the same hallways and you can you can.
02:20:57 And it's funny that like you can identify like what part of the ship they're in,
02:21:01 if you know what to look for, because they have all the same sets and all the sets
02:21:05 are like there's there's specific parts of the ship.
02:21:08 So they'll they'll pass through like the same hallway on the way to get to the same
02:21:11 elevator and like the way to the bridge and stuff.
02:21:15 Yeah, like they put I mean, I haven't I've only two episodes in so far.
02:21:19 Oh, yeah. Oh, right, right.
02:21:20 But I've just seen other I've seen bits.
02:21:22 I've seen bits.
02:21:23 I've just not watched the show in its fullness and it's like I've just seen.
02:21:28 I've just seen I've seen I've seen a map and I've seen somewhere I saw an image
02:21:32 that showed like, oh, yeah, if you look at the map, like when they're in this hallway,
02:21:37 like it's it's it's here in the interior map of the of the ship or whatever.
02:21:43 But they don't have them all connected.
02:21:46 Those sets those sets aren't connected in that exact way because like how do they move?
02:21:50 You mean.
02:21:52 Well, they disconnected.
02:21:54 Well, you know, that's that's the magic of television.
02:21:56 You know, you don't actually have to build the ship and like actually travel through.
02:22:00 I know, but like like it's it's I guess extra attention to detail that they would
02:22:06 know what hallway to use, what set to use for a generic walking show.
02:22:11 There's there's probably there's probably bits.
02:22:14 I bet some nerd on some forum in like the year 1992 wrote like a big thing
02:22:20 about like in this scene of they actually walk through the maintenance bay before
02:22:25 they get to the bridge, but like the maintenance bay is actually on the other
02:22:28 side from the the pleasure quarters, so, you know, they wouldn't have had to walk
02:22:31 through that room in this case pleasure quarters.
02:22:34 No, I would the holodeck the holodeck is what I'm talking about.
02:22:37 Have you seen it?
02:22:39 Yeah, you ever watch you ever watch
02:22:41 the real gyms like Simpsons Mysteries?
02:22:44 Yes, I love those videos.
02:22:46 Have you seen the one about the Rumpus room?
02:22:50 Yes, I do.
02:22:52 It's the it's the one that that Homer is sitting in a beanbag chair.
02:22:56 Yeah.
02:22:56 During the episode where they're all fighting over the comic book and he looks
02:23:00 out the window. Yeah, I think so.
02:23:02 When the lightning flashes and he's like, oh, they're fine.
02:23:05 Like that's a little one moment gag.
02:23:07 And then that room just most of the time just doesn't exist.
02:23:10 Yeah, it doesn't exist.
02:23:12 Sometimes it's referenced most of the time it doesn't exist.
02:23:15 When it does exist, its location is kind of inconsistent.
02:23:20 And sometimes the house exterior is shown in a way where like there probably should
02:23:24 be a window that would look out from the Rumpus room, but there is no window there.
02:23:30 But like, you know, in the Simpsons, they do have a general house layout where like
02:23:34 you understand how like the kitchen and the the front hall and the stairway up to
02:23:39 the bedrooms and the living room all fit together.
02:23:43 And sometimes they put a Rumpus room there and sometimes they don't.
02:23:46 And they know what really nobody really knows where the stairway leading to the
02:23:50 basement is, because it never really appears unless it's needed and someone's
02:23:55 going to the basement.
02:23:56 But yeah, in in they put they put the same thought into the the Star Trek where
02:24:01 like there's a general idea that like if they have to go to the med bay,
02:24:06 well, you know, the the engine room is on the way to the med bay.
02:24:10 So they might pass through the engine room while they're walking or whatever.
02:24:15 It's just good.
02:24:16 It's good stuff, continuity, consistency.
02:24:19 You like you like that?
02:24:21 No, no.
02:24:24 I don't really have that much to say about Star Trek,
02:24:27 because I haven't watched that much of it.
02:24:28 I've just I've just seen mostly TNG.
02:24:32 Used to see it as a kid on TV sometimes.
02:24:35 I hope to finish the entire show.
02:24:38 And then I'll be so smart.
02:24:43 You'll be as smart as Peacard.
02:24:47 Peacard, so clever.
02:24:49 Like Pecan.
02:24:51 It's pecan.
02:24:52 It's a pecan pie.
02:24:54 Do you say pecan?
02:24:55 Oh, John, look pecan.
02:24:56 Do you say pecan or pecan?
02:24:59 I actually do say I actually do say pecan.
02:25:02 I think in the south, they say pecan.
02:25:05 Yeah, I don't think I.
02:25:07 Yeah, cringe, cringe.
02:25:09 Pecan just sounds funny anyway.
02:25:11 True.
02:25:12 A pecan pie.
02:25:15 No, I'm sorry, pecan pie.
02:25:17 I'm sorry, P E C A N pecan pecan.
02:25:22 There's no pecan if it were pecan.
02:25:27 Then I don't know, they would.
02:25:28 You would have an age in before the end.
02:25:30 Right, exactly, exactly.
02:25:36 Yeah, I mean, I don't think I have anything else to.
02:25:39 I don't have any other topics.
02:25:41 We could do one piece or we could do voicemails or we could do nothing.
02:25:49 We could do what did we do last time with one piece?
02:25:54 Do we do it after voicemails?
02:25:56 I think we did it before.
02:25:58 OK, let's do it.
02:25:59 All right, let's let me read.
02:26:02 I forgot to I forgot to read it.
02:26:05 You little rascal, even though you told me to.
02:26:09 Is it 1077?
02:26:11 1077, yes.
02:26:14 I it came out during your stream.
02:26:16 So I mentioned it in the stream chat.
02:26:18 Right. And then I said I was going to go read it.
02:26:20 But then instead I rated Nate's stream
02:26:25 and Nate was reading one piece, but I didn't stick around.
02:26:28 That's why I was reminded because I was doing his one piece stream.
02:26:33 Yeah.
02:26:34 Oh, does he have another person in the Talking Pirates?
02:26:39 Were you jealous? You really should be Talking Pirate.
02:26:41 Oh, you're right.
02:26:43 Well, yeah, I'm a Talking Pirate and I'm here to tell you.
02:26:48 I think.
02:26:49 OK, I very funny and true.
02:26:52 I mean, to be pedantic, I think that the implication is that
02:26:57 we're we're talking pirates like we're they're talking about pirates.
02:27:01 Yeah, but it would only become a pun if there were multiple people on the show.
02:27:04 That's true, true and valid.
02:27:11 I thought you're asking like who
02:27:14 is the new girl?
02:27:18 Michelle, she's just silent.
02:27:20 She's like, I hate one piece.
02:27:22 I hate one piece. I hate one piece.
02:27:23 I've never. Oh, but look, she just can't.
02:27:25 Oh, but look at there.
02:27:27 But look at but look at Caesar.
02:27:29 Oh, but look at Caesar, though.
02:27:32 Cold season cold.
02:27:34 Jerma's cold blooded voyage volume 32.
02:27:37 Wait a sec. It's all vega punks fault.
02:27:40 Hmm.
02:27:42 All right. Yes.
02:27:43 I went back because I was lost.
02:27:47 I will recount this cover arc because it might be important.
02:27:52 OK.
02:27:55 So Jerma, right?
02:27:57 The the guys who are at the whole cake arc.
02:28:01 They saved Sanji or they were trying to take Sanji or no,
02:28:04 they were there for the wedding, but then everything went fucked up.
02:28:07 And so they became good guys to help Sanji and everyone escape.
02:28:10 Um,
02:28:13 Caesar was also there and in their escape,
02:28:18 Caesar was like, please take me with you, Jerma.
02:28:21 And so the Jerma siblings, they flew over
02:28:25 and they got onto their castle snail ship thing kingdom.
02:28:31 Right. They're floating kingdom.
02:28:33 I mean, the whole the whole cakes did the big mom people.
02:28:36 No, no, no, Caesar did.
02:28:38 They got away.
02:28:38 They basically Caesar did some really fucked up stuff and they stole.
02:28:43 They stole pudding.
02:28:45 It's a little hard to know because I think Blackbeard has pudding now.
02:28:50 But pudding was stolen in the escape.
02:28:52 Is pudding still evil or is she good now?
02:28:56 She she I think she's good.
02:28:58 She did she like decided she likes Sanji.
02:29:01 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:29:02 That's why she she changed her tune.
02:29:04 I was like, I love you Sanji.
02:29:07 It's like actually heartfelt and cute that they like each other.
02:29:11 Yeah.
02:29:14 But yeah, the thing with whole cake, the Jerma were like two of them were captured
02:29:19 and the other siblings came and broke them out and they ran away.
02:29:22 Caesar came with them.
02:29:25 And then I guess he bumped into Judge and then they were like, who's this clown?
02:29:30 They fought for a moment.
02:29:31 But then they remembered that shared past and what we were in the previous
02:29:36 cover art pages were like, Oh, the Mads scientists.
02:29:40 They were remembering that was their thought their thought bubble.
02:29:44 Like, oh, yeah, we were in the Mad Scientist thing together.
02:29:47 And don't you remember that vagabond guy?
02:29:49 He's the reason everything got fucked up.
02:29:51 Is it because he won that?
02:29:53 Is it because he like won that contest with the flower gunpowder?
02:29:57 Yeah, he won the contest and he's the best scientist.
02:30:00 Oh my god, it's just like Dr.
02:30:01 Light was granted funding for his for his improved AI over Dr.
02:30:06 Wiley's gear system, the double gear.
02:30:09 These guys with their double gears
02:30:13 and they fought for a while and they're tired of hunting.
02:30:17 I'll show the world that my green blood technology was was right all along.
02:30:23 Well, I mean, yeah, that's that's mega punk who did that.
02:30:26 Oh, shit, you're right.
02:30:28 So it's the other thing.
02:30:29 It's my smile fruits.
02:30:31 My shitty my shitty smile fruits are better than
02:30:33 Vega Punks good actually work right fruits.
02:30:36 Fuck that guy.
02:30:39 So, yeah, these two seem to have come to an agreement of some kind that they are
02:30:43 like with each other against why were they against each other is important.
02:30:49 Why were they against each other in the first place?
02:30:52 Because they were it was a scientist like competition.
02:30:56 Oh, right. And they were all they were all fighting for second place.
02:30:59 But Vega Punk was the guy who was better than them all.
02:31:02 So in this moment, I guess they're like, wait a minute,
02:31:05 why don't we just kill Vega Punk?
02:31:06 Why don't we kill that guy?
02:31:07 That's in the present, though.
02:31:08 That's not like back in the past.
02:31:10 Now, this is the present that they're thinking.
02:31:12 Yeah, they're saying this is all Vega Punks fault,
02:31:15 which is at least why they stop fighting and I don't know what else it means.
02:31:18 But I guess we'll know next week if this continues.
02:31:20 I guess I forgot that they were fighting in the present.
02:31:24 Yeah, it's like like a bunch of weeks ago.
02:31:27 They started the Thought Bubble,
02:31:28 which opened up with the mad scientists.
02:31:30 Yeah, what?
02:31:32 And then it's finishing.
02:31:33 Why were they fighting?
02:31:34 Did they just like happen to run into each other somewhere?
02:31:36 And they were like, yeah, it's you again.
02:31:38 They ran into each other because Caesar Clown,
02:31:41 who was on whole cake, escaped with the German siblings,
02:31:44 you know, Sanji's brothers and sisters and sister as they came back.
02:31:50 You can see them in like Ichiji and
02:31:52 right, Kujo, I can't remember her name.
02:31:55 Right.
02:31:57 Just sort of hanging out, being like, yeah, they're fighting.
02:31:59 They're still like, they don't give a shit.
02:32:04 And in the in the thing, I went back,
02:32:07 pudding was Kid Matt and if I can cracker was turned poison full.
02:32:13 It looks like the poison from punk has a cracker.
02:32:15 So I thought Caesar did it.
02:32:17 Who's cracker cracker cracker was one of the
02:32:20 the
02:32:22 what do you call them, the commanders of the of the big mom pirates who
02:32:26 Luffy defeated with Gear 4th.
02:32:28 That was the introduction of Gear 4th into the comic.
02:32:31 OK.
02:32:32 And he smashed his crackers that he kept making.
02:32:35 They had a cracker fruit.
02:32:38 He beat the shit out of him.
02:32:40 And then.
02:32:43 Yeah, so.
02:32:45 Pudding was Kid Matt.
02:32:47 But then we later see pudding aboard Blackbeard ship.
02:32:51 Kidnapped like imprisoned with Kobe, I think.
02:32:57 So I don't know who whether Blackbeard was there or whether Caesar gave it,
02:33:01 gave pudding to them or I don't fucking know what's going on.
02:33:04 Yeah, yeah.
02:33:07 But anyway, it's a lot to keep track of for sure.
02:33:10 That's that's a little reminder of what the fuck this cover is about.
02:33:14 Yeah, OK.
02:33:16 So I mean, long story short, Caesar and
02:33:19 Jerma are teaming up and not Jerma.
02:33:21 Wait, is his name Jerma?
02:33:23 Judge, Caesar and judge are teaming up.
02:33:26 Or it seems that way.
02:33:28 Seems that way.
02:33:32 OK, I'm.
02:33:34 Partway through the chapter and OK, so
02:33:39 Shaka says they're talking about King.
02:33:42 They just they just noticed that these guys are Lunarians.
02:33:45 And Shaka says
02:33:48 he talking about King, he said he was called Abler and he was a test subject.
02:33:53 Who escaped punk hazard with Kaido.
02:33:55 So I guess that that's how they got Lunarian DNA was from King.
02:34:01 OK, yeah, make about that.
02:34:03 The thing was the thing was Zorro
02:34:05 seeing like he's the one who knows all the information.
02:34:08 He just took him really far too long to put it together.
02:34:11 He's colorblind.
02:34:12 He's colorblind.
02:34:14 Hey, it doesn't have depth perception anymore.
02:34:16 Right.
02:34:17 That changes your color.
02:34:19 Right.
02:34:21 In that case, pay attention to the flames on their backs.
02:34:23 Right. OK, so the.
02:34:26 So when the flame is on.
02:34:30 They're like they're invincible kind of.
02:34:32 But when the flame is off, they're like super fast or something like that.
02:34:38 Like there's a reason they turn it on and off, right?
02:34:42 Oh, yes, yes.
02:34:43 They do.
02:34:46 They don't fight.
02:34:48 They can't do damage.
02:34:50 I think I can't remember exactly, but I think King only attacked
02:34:54 when his flames were off.
02:34:55 Yeah.
02:34:57 And that's the only time he was vulnerable as well.
02:35:00 So when he's got his flames on, he's not attacking.
02:35:03 Yeah, yeah.
02:35:04 Which means that you've got to attack when they attack.
02:35:09 That's so fucking strong.
02:35:11 Don't do this.
02:35:12 It is very strong.
02:35:15 Mainly Lunarians are the main aliens.
02:35:18 They're not from the moon, though, right?
02:35:20 Despite the name.
02:35:24 Well, we don't know.
02:35:25 OK.
02:35:26 The only thing we know about Lunarians are that King is one of them
02:35:30 and they have these characteristics.
02:35:33 When when Enel went to the moon, there were like some other aliens there that were not.
02:35:38 There were Mole Man on the moon.
02:35:42 And that's considered canon because it was a cover story, I think.
02:35:45 Yeah, yeah.
02:35:49 I mean, the moon's pretty big.
02:35:51 Maybe there's Lunarians as well.
02:35:54 I feel like they said someone said that Lunarians like came.
02:35:59 They lived on the red line.
02:36:03 But I mean.
02:36:04 It could be.
02:36:06 Could be a big important thing.
02:36:08 I don't remember that.
02:36:09 I was thinking.
02:36:10 Hey, did we talk about this that like the red line is artificial?
02:36:16 I think I had that as a pretend like an idea.
02:36:18 Yeah, OK, maybe it was built and therefore
02:36:22 cut off the oceans from one another so that they could be more easily controlled.
02:36:26 Definitely. I mean, if that's true, then it wouldn't make any sense for them to like be from there.
02:36:33 Because like it didn't exist for that long.
02:36:36 I guess it could have existed for like a thousand years.
02:36:39 Maybe the devil fruit is like, I got the line line fruit.
02:36:43 Line line.
02:36:45 Yeah, maybe.
02:36:48 I was thinking it was one of the one of the
02:36:51 the ancient weapons that might have created it.
02:36:55 I think I think I think we talked about this already.
02:36:59 I think in fact, I think you probably said that and that's where I got that idea.
02:37:07 Yes. Yeah.
02:37:07 OK, just I'm I'm paying attention.
02:37:11 I am paying attention.
02:37:12 I'm I'm I'm also reading Nami's butt.
02:37:16 There it is.
02:37:20 Let's show that.
02:37:22 Let's show that.
02:37:23 Let's make let's make let's make zoom in.
02:37:25 Let's make real sure to show that.
02:37:29 We wouldn't want the listeners to feel like they're missing out.
02:37:33 It's petite.
02:37:35 It's petite.
02:37:37 It's got that thigh gap.
02:37:40 This is important.
02:37:42 True.
02:37:44 So very true.
02:37:47 Jin boy, Jin boy, that's good.
02:37:51 Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt should do double damage
02:37:54 because Jin boy is water elemental.
02:37:56 So lightning should do double and it did.
02:37:59 Yeah, it worked pretty, pretty effective.
02:38:01 Hey.
02:38:03 Oh, he splashes into the floor.
02:38:05 The way is it called the wave wave fruit?
02:38:07 It's so awesome.
02:38:08 Yeah.
02:38:09 The being able to swim through solid.
02:38:11 And that was it was
02:38:13 senior pink. I was going to say Mr.
02:38:15 Yeah, senior pink.
02:38:18 Is Brooke able to like sense
02:38:21 where he is through like soul magic?
02:38:24 Because he like senses that he's swimming through the floor.
02:38:27 No, I think he just saw.
02:38:30 He saw it or he heard the splash.
02:38:32 And so it's like he's under the floor.
02:38:35 Watch out.
02:38:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think you're right.
02:38:39 But it looked like he fell because he was damaged.
02:38:44 I will decree one.
02:38:46 Anyone who threatens Nami saw him face Kevin.
02:38:48 Decree nine.
02:38:51 Anyone who makes her scream will receive dot, dot, dot.
02:38:57 The numbers used might be a pun as nine and one can be combined to form Kui,
02:39:02 which can imply fishing, seafood in some contexts.
02:39:06 OK.
02:39:09 Yeah, because because Jim Bae is a fish and Sanji cooks fish.
02:39:13 Yes.
02:39:15 Oh, true.
02:39:16 You could you could use knives and cut him.
02:39:20 It's his one weakness, actually.
02:39:23 He's being being cooked, being filleted.
02:39:27 Oh, there's another.
02:39:29 There's Lilith's butt.
02:39:31 Let's let's show it.
02:39:34 Let's let's let's not neglect to show it.
02:39:39 Poo boy.
02:39:42 Bubble gun bubble, something else.
02:39:46 Hey, ho.
02:39:49 Let's go.
02:39:52 You and Nate are exactly the same.
02:39:54 I.
02:39:58 I don't know these these butts are not.
02:40:00 They're not that great.
02:40:01 They're OK. They're fine.
02:40:03 I'm a I'm a boob, the fact that they are being drawn.
02:40:05 I'm a drawn attention to a boob guy.
02:40:08 Yeah, I heard I heard Nate.
02:40:09 I heard Nate saying that it's kind of unusual.
02:40:12 There are like so many butts on display and it's kind of true.
02:40:15 Yeah, Oda Oda doesn't really focus on but I don't know.
02:40:20 I I would have to to go back and like actually count
02:40:24 how many gratuitous butt shots there are.
02:40:26 I don't really remember there being that many.
02:40:29 There's two in this chapter draws your attention to it,
02:40:31 but maybe the ever so often maybe it just happens.
02:40:34 Maybe, maybe, maybe.
02:40:38 After some serious reason, we have to we have to we're going to have to look into
02:40:41 this deeply green.
02:40:44 Oh, here we go.
02:40:46 Bubble gun.
02:40:48 She brushed it off like it was nothing.
02:40:50 Huh. Green blood gives you the pros and cons of having a fruit ability.
02:40:54 And these bubbles were designed to hurt.
02:40:55 OK, so.
02:40:58 Yeah, they're weak too.
02:40:59 They're they're they're weak as same as any fruit user.
02:41:03 OK.
02:41:05 Which is a I'm glad because otherwise there'd be way too upbeat.
02:41:08 It would be. Yeah, if it were like.
02:41:11 If it were like, yeah, actually lumarian blood like means that like now they they
02:41:15 they're fine in water and see some doesn't do anything to them.
02:41:18 And yeah.
02:41:22 Also, I'm I'm yeah, you you read, but I have a comment.
02:41:28 Go ahead.
02:41:31 I think this is the first time we've heard one of these seraphim speak.
02:41:38 Um, yeah.
02:41:42 I didn't realize they had like they could talk.
02:41:45 I think that's and have a personality, but this little Hancock,
02:41:51 she's she's doing I think I saw someone on Twitter say that they thought that young
02:41:56 Hancock might be the only one that can have feelings because it's like
02:42:02 specifically tied to her fruit power is like emotions.
02:42:06 And I don't know if that's true or not.
02:42:08 But I mean, I I have no reason to believe that the others don't have anything to say.
02:42:16 Yeah, but they it could be like that.
02:42:19 I feel like because Zoro said, oh, you're more than a robot.
02:42:24 You're I can sense humanity in you.
02:42:26 Like he could tell that the little mehawk
02:42:29 was not just a robot.
02:42:31 It was a person like he sense something.
02:42:33 So like I feel like that means a little bit.
02:42:37 He just doesn't feel like talking that much, I guess.
02:42:41 OK, I see nor Jim Bay nor Kuma.
02:42:44 They're all quite quiet people.
02:42:46 True. That's true.
02:42:48 I think I think it was tectonic improv in my discord mentioned something about this.
02:42:53 And it seems like yeah, the original boa Hancock uses the mellow mellow fruit
02:42:58 by like if it makes you fall in love with her or something.
02:43:03 This baby one does not do that.
02:43:07 This one this one gets you by making you think that she's cute.
02:43:11 She does a little wink and they go, oh, so that's good.
02:43:13 That's good that it doesn't work the same way.
02:43:17 Uh.
02:43:22 I'm a little unsettled, honestly,
02:43:24 because it's up is he's turned to stone.
02:43:27 He's dead.
02:43:29 So is Frankie, you're you're on and Lilith, too.
02:43:33 You're unsettled by that, that that's a problem for you.
02:43:38 Well, you know, I feel like being made of stone is not so good.
02:43:41 Oh, he's been in he's been in tougher jams than he's gotten himself.
02:43:47 Out of it, you know, it's on the one hand.
02:43:53 On yeah, on the one hand, it's like,
02:43:56 oh, no, if the Seraphim continue to be enemies,
02:44:01 then he's dead.
02:44:03 But this just sort of means that, oh, they'll be friends again.
02:44:06 I guess because she'll undo it.
02:44:08 Is it is the only way to undo it is if they like choose to undo the stone thing?
02:44:12 Is that how it works? I forget.
02:44:14 That's how I understand it.
02:44:16 Yeah.
02:44:17 It's like, like, I remember a time.
02:44:21 Not like long ago, but like not that long ago in the canon of the story,
02:44:28 Hancock and Blackbeard were fighting.
02:44:32 And she she had the ability to unstone a bunch of people on the mirror.
02:44:38 Marines were there also.
02:44:40 Or something, there was something going on.
02:44:43 But she had the she had the bargaining chip of being able to unstone people.
02:44:48 So presumably they would stay like that otherwise.
02:44:53 Yeah.
02:44:54 OK, well, I mean, I guess she'll have to either get her
02:44:58 to help them out or they'll have to figure some other secret trick to unstone
02:45:06 somebody. I'm on the last bit now and I see Shaka has been assassinated.
02:45:11 Oh, my God, this is gruesome.
02:45:13 It's like a pretty gruesome panel.
02:45:16 Yeah. Damn.
02:45:18 Shaka, he's been shot.
02:45:19 What's going on? Who was that?
02:45:21 He's been shooted.
02:45:23 It's nothing I would hope with a single shot.
02:45:26 Shot through these. Who's that you brought with you, huh?
02:45:30 OK, so I mean, seems like it wasn't Shaka.
02:45:34 And and unless this is an elaborate ruse to fake his own death.
02:45:38 Yeah, yeah.
02:45:40 And Vega, I don't know.
02:45:42 Vega Punk seems genuinely surprised by this.
02:45:45 So it doesn't seem like Stella is like now is evil.
02:45:49 I mean, he seems I feel like it's it's pretty clear that Vega Punk is not the one
02:45:54 pulling the strings. Yeah.
02:45:56 It was always a bit weird, the idea that he would be outed as a villain
02:46:00 soon after being agreeing to like go with the Straw Hat Pirates on their journey.
02:46:06 Yeah, you're right.
02:46:06 And being an enemy of the world government.
02:46:08 That'd be like a little weird.
02:46:09 You're right.
02:46:11 But yeah, have his own plans.
02:46:13 Like, I don't know, I don't think it's that outrageous, but yeah.
02:46:18 Yeah, it's a little different than law with having like their pirates.
02:46:22 So ultimately, we know that their alliance will end and it did after Kaido.
02:46:27 So.
02:46:30 But either way, yeah.
02:46:32 So this chapter,
02:46:34 brief recap, everyone's fighting the Seraphim
02:46:38 and some people are doing not so good.
02:46:43 Yeah, true.
02:46:44 Yeah, Sanji seems to be holding his own against Jim Bae for the time being.
02:46:48 I think Nami and Sanji and Brooke will be OK.
02:46:51 Yeah.
02:46:53 I mean, Sanji and Brooke against Zoro and Luffy will be OK.
02:46:56 But Usopp, Lilith and Frankie, they fucking are dead.
02:46:59 Yeah, they're toast. Yeah, it's over.
02:47:01 It's it's freaking over.
02:47:04 And then Shaka gets shot in the head and with a little pistol gun.
02:47:07 I imagine they'll probably end up in the tank with Vega Punk.
02:47:13 Well, maybe.
02:47:15 Well, I mean, yeah, it's someone.
02:47:19 Whoever's whoever's pulling the strings and just shot Shaka and is keeping these CP
02:47:23 nine, these CP agents in here is probably the same person who's controlling the.
02:47:28 The Seraphim, right?
02:47:30 So I mean, I imagine they will take these stone statues and bring them to the tank.
02:47:37 OK, so here is my thought process.
02:47:42 Where's Stussy?
02:47:44 Yeah, where is she right now?
02:47:47 Haven't seen her.
02:47:50 She was with someone.
02:47:51 She was with one of the groups that we just looked at.
02:47:55 And now she's.
02:47:57 Oh, no, wait, she was with Chopper.
02:47:59 Wasn't she wait?
02:48:01 No, she was she was with she was with Sanji.
02:48:03 Stussy, I was thinking of Bonnie.
02:48:06 Stussy Bonnie is also on the on the loose.
02:48:09 And Chopper is as we haven't seen Chopper.
02:48:12 Yeah, Chopper is the assassin.
02:48:14 He learned to learn to shoot.
02:48:16 He did it. Yeah.
02:48:17 He got his little poofs.
02:48:19 He violated his Hippocratic Oath
02:48:22 and became a demon.
02:48:26 He's he's like unlocked blood on his hooves.
02:48:30 He awakened his human, human devil fruit and became the worst thing ever.
02:48:35 A person.
02:48:41 Wait, the worst, monsterful man.
02:48:44 Are his are his new like post time skip forms.
02:48:47 Is this is that his awakened like zone?
02:48:49 Is that what that's about?
02:48:50 No, no, I don't think so.
02:48:52 I think Luchi and Kaku awaken their zones
02:48:55 and that's why they look different now, right?
02:48:57 Yeah, I mean, I think there's
02:49:01 potential for like Chopper to have found a medicinal way of awakening a devil fruit
02:49:07 with his rumble ball, but maybe it's just for him.
02:49:10 Yeah.
02:49:11 Yeah, I'm not really sure.
02:49:12 Because like the idea that he can do all of these
02:49:14 different forms, whereas normally a zone can only have three forms,
02:49:18 he can have like seven plus a giant monster.
02:49:21 Maybe for him, it's just him using like medicine to fuck with it.
02:49:25 Just kind of means that like his forms are like a different thing than like
02:49:29 yeah, classical, whatever awakening.
02:49:31 What does it what does awakening even mean?
02:49:34 It just just just level out better.
02:49:37 Yeah, it's just you figure out that you can actually do an even better animal.
02:49:41 You can do it.
02:49:42 You can utilize this power in a way that you thought was not possible before.
02:49:46 You can do more with it, right?
02:49:48 Or whatever.
02:49:53 Well, yeah, so it's interesting with Chopper because like maybe his ability
02:50:00 to do that is like going to be revolutionary,
02:50:02 but nobody really thinks about it because he's a little reindeer and he's a little
02:50:06 cute reindeer and he never gets recognition.
02:50:08 He never gets a good bounty.
02:50:10 He's the most impressive medicinal mind in the world.
02:50:12 It would be it would be pretty funny if he like, yeah,
02:50:15 if he hit with his like five berry bounty, like completely revolutionizes
02:50:20 like fruit technology or something.
02:50:23 And it's like, yeah,
02:50:24 Vega Punk will have a field day with his medicine.
02:50:26 Yeah, that's interesting.
02:50:28 Yeah, anyway, like them to get to talk about science and shit.
02:50:33 That'd be cool.
02:50:34 So the very end of the chapter, Shaka gets shot in the head
02:50:38 and blood has come out of his head and there's blood coming on the thing.
02:50:42 But then there's a few panels.
02:50:43 It says katak, katak, katak, meaning a
02:50:49 footstep that goes one, two, which I'm assuming is like a heel.
02:50:55 So like a high heel, heel, toe, katak, katak.
02:50:59 That's what I'm assuming that might be referencing.
02:51:02 I think I think, though,
02:51:06 that Stussy was wearing the same clothes as everyone else with the big round shoes.
02:51:11 I'm not sure it could be her.
02:51:13 The only reason it could be her is just because she's mysterious.
02:51:17 She's been on the island before.
02:51:20 Do we know that?
02:51:23 Yeah, remember when you phoned up, like we need help.
02:51:27 We need help from that mysterious person.
02:51:30 And it turned out it was Stussy.
02:51:31 OK, OK.
02:51:34 So like she was on the island.
02:51:35 Yeah, that's looking.
02:51:37 And meaning that she knows the island, she knows a bit about stuff and she can go
02:51:42 around places and she's mysterious.
02:51:44 And she's already shown to be a double agent for
02:51:49 the Cypher pole.
02:51:52 And she's she's also a vampire and a clone of a lady
02:52:00 that was on the Rocks Pirates, who is an old lady who is now got the son,
02:52:06 Edward Weevil, a son of Whitebeard going around.
02:52:10 Right.
02:52:11 So she is obviously very important to something.
02:52:14 Why she's killing people, I don't know.
02:52:16 But the fact is she very easily could be.
02:52:20 I think I think she's she's going to walk down there with a kutuk
02:52:24 like high heel and she's going to be like, haha.
02:52:27 Yeah, I'm evil.
02:52:28 I think that sounds pretty dang plausible.
02:52:31 That's that's the best theory I got.
02:52:35 No, you don't got it.
02:52:36 I have it now.
02:52:38 It's now I heard it.
02:52:40 I've internalized it.
02:52:41 It was easy.
02:52:42 I put it in a marketplace of ideas for free and how it's been used and abused.
02:52:46 Exactly. Exactly.
02:52:48 I mean.
02:52:51 Yeah, I think you're probably right.
02:52:57 Fucking I don't know what her.
02:52:59 I mean, you know, she she betrayed the other CP guys as in Kaku and
02:53:06 Luchi. So, you know, this is just a continuation of that trend of betraying the CP.
02:53:15 So, yeah, it all kind of, yeah, it kind of makes a lot of sense.
02:53:18 They're making a lot of sense right now.
02:53:20 Whatever she's doing, I think if she's a clone of a rocks pirates person,
02:53:25 I think that fact might be.
02:53:29 Like indicative of motivation for her.
02:53:34 Yeah, because why else would it?
02:53:36 Why else would you have her be also a clone of a famous pirate from a pirate
02:53:40 crew that was almost reforming when big mom and Kaido said, hey,
02:53:45 let's reform the rocks pirates.
02:53:47 Remember the rocks pirates?
02:53:49 Let's do that again.
02:53:50 I wonder if there's some, I don't know, some kind of like thing that only someone
02:53:56 with like that DNA could could access like a secret room,
02:54:02 like the Paw Paw Fruit information room or something like that.
02:54:07 Yeah, I'm seeing a situation where Bunny is going to be integral to saving everyone.
02:54:14 Yeah, because she's nowhere to be found right now.
02:54:16 Yeah. And Kuma.
02:54:18 Where's Kuma?
02:54:19 Kuma's in he's climbing Red Line to Marijwa, I think.
02:54:23 Yeah.
02:54:24 Yeah, from for a moment there, I thought he was flying towards Egghead.
02:54:29 Although.
02:54:31 Is he on the other side of the red line to Egghead?
02:54:36 I don't think so.
02:54:37 No, no, he's not.
02:54:40 They're in the New World, right?
02:54:42 The the Revolutionary Army HQ is in the New World and so is this.
02:54:48 I think I want to say, yeah, I think he probably is in the New World.
02:54:53 So he would be on the same side.
02:54:55 So it's not like he's climbing the Red Line to jump over it and get to new Egghead.
02:55:00 Probably not.
02:55:03 I wouldn't think I wouldn't following the program.
02:55:05 I wouldn't assume so.
02:55:08 Yeah.
02:55:10 Don't know what he's doing, but I haven't seen him in a while.
02:55:15 Yeah, Bonnie's around.
02:55:18 So Sentomaru is talking about Ohara.
02:55:23 But he didn't really tell us anything we didn't already know.
02:55:26 Yeah, we already knew that the world government is here to destroy the world
02:55:30 of the island because of information they have.
02:55:33 I like the panel where it's like, by the way, this happened like 12 years ago.
02:55:38 Refresher on the Ohara.
02:55:39 It happened 12 years ago in in the comic and in real life.
02:55:43 Yeah, look at that little that little drawing of Aokiji in the bottom right.
02:55:50 He's so.
02:55:51 Yeah.
02:55:52 Mm hmm.
02:55:55 Very cool.
02:55:56 Mm hmm.
02:55:59 Niko Rubin's got a little like square smile.
02:56:03 She's a little tiny.
02:56:04 She looks silly.
02:56:05 She looks very silly.
02:56:06 Wait, wait, wait.
02:56:08 Let's let's get a let's get a zoom.
02:56:12 I don't know what to do.
02:56:13 The more I look at it, the funnier it gets.
02:56:17 It's just a little like the the the the ink
02:56:20 uses just a little too thick for a mouth.
02:56:22 It didn't quite, but it doesn't matter.
02:56:24 It's fine, whatever. Yeah.
02:56:25 Yeah, yeah, print it, print it, send it to the send of the printers.
02:56:29 Hell, yeah.
02:56:30 Um, okay.
02:56:33 Well, I guess I don't really have that much else to say about this chapter.
02:56:40 It was good.
02:56:41 I liked it.
02:56:43 I had fun.
02:56:45 Uh, uh, the Seraphim.
02:56:46 Yeah, I think I think it's probably true
02:56:48 that if a young what's her shit?
02:56:51 The Amazon, um, not Bellatrix Hancock can speak, then probably all of them
02:56:57 have the ability to speak and all that.
02:57:00 But I mean, she only spoke to like do a fricking strategic thing.
02:57:09 She might not not actually like have, I mean,
02:57:13 she's probably like a complete sociopath
02:57:15 who can only like who can only fake emotions.
02:57:19 Yeah, that would be like she can speak if she needs to for some strategic purpose,
02:57:24 but like she doesn't wouldn't do it normally because like she's a killing machine.
02:57:31 Yeah, that bubblegum will be useful.
02:57:35 Right. Yeah, it was pretty good.
02:57:39 I was at the if only if only well, Luffy could get little Hancock
02:57:44 because Luffy doesn't care about women.
02:57:49 He might still think she's cute.
02:57:51 No, no, he probably wouldn't care.
02:57:55 Yes, it's an odd it's odd because it's a different kind of thing.
02:57:58 The idea, the joke before is that Luffy doesn't he's asexual, you know, he doesn't
02:58:02 like, huh, beautiful woman.
02:58:04 What's that? I don't care.
02:58:05 What if what if the fact?
02:58:06 Hey, do you have any meat?
02:58:07 You know, like that's that's his bit.
02:58:08 But like when it's a little cute girl, it's a different kind of thing.
02:58:12 But I haven't seen Luffy do like it.
02:58:14 Oh, it would be kind of funny.
02:58:17 And I would kind of buy it if like, oh, my God,
02:58:20 now Hancock's power works on Luffy because she's not hot.
02:58:23 Now she's cute and that and he's and he's and Luffy's normal enough
02:58:27 that like he cares about that sort of thing.
02:58:31 But I could also see it just being like he doesn't give a fuck about anything.
02:58:35 Yeah, I mean, at this point, I think.
02:58:38 Who in the crew, if not Luffy, could resist the cute rays?
02:58:44 Maybe maybe Zoro.
02:58:47 I was thinking Zoro, yeah.
02:58:48 I don't I don't think Zoro would be particularly moved by a by a cute vulnerable being.
02:58:58 He does have that that Nico, Nico Robin probably would not.
02:59:02 I'm not Tashiki or was it Tashiki?
02:59:05 The person who we know is Tashiki, like the underling to smoker.
02:59:09 But like, what was the name?
02:59:11 Is it Kuina, a Kushin?
02:59:13 Kuina. Yeah, I want to say it's Kuina.
02:59:15 Yes. You know, that's true.
02:59:18 So he might feel some does have emotions.
02:59:20 But yeah, I'm not saying he doesn't feel I don't feel like he's like.
02:59:26 Yeah, he might.
02:59:27 He doesn't get as riled up in the same way as the others.
02:59:32 I think what do you think about Nico Robin?
02:59:36 Do you think Nico Robin could be would be or maybe Nami might be cutthroat enough
02:59:42 that she might not be Nami and Nico Robin could be.
02:59:47 I could see it going either way.
02:59:49 I could see it going either way for both of them.
02:59:52 I think I think because Lilith smiled and she got that Nami would also.
02:59:59 I think Nico Robin.
03:00:01 She finds things cute that are pathetic.
03:00:03 You're right.
03:00:04 She really likes the dark things and she likes dark things.
03:00:09 And like, she finds pathetic things adorable.
03:00:13 What do you? Is there an example?
03:00:14 I don't remember.
03:00:17 Oh, what was it?
03:00:18 It was what's his name?
03:00:20 Kanji Rose, shittily drawn dragon beast.
03:00:24 They used to climb the elephant.
03:00:26 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
03:00:29 To climb, so and she was like, oh, my God, you can do it.
03:00:33 Like, it's like such a terrible drawing and everyone was like,
03:00:37 oh, this guy sucks.
03:00:38 But she was almost in tears about how much she loved.
03:00:40 Well, I mean, when she she was so sad when he died, I forgot about that.
03:00:45 That's so funny.
03:00:46 It was such a nice little moment.
03:00:47 I've totally forgot about that.
03:00:49 OK, on the one hand, I mean, Bella, not Bella, why do we keep Boa?
03:00:54 Boa being like, oh, this is agonizing.
03:00:56 Oh, it hurts so bad.
03:00:57 Like that is kind of pathetic.
03:00:58 But yeah, I think that.
03:01:00 Well, not not pathetic.
03:01:01 And I think she would see through the manipulation.
03:01:04 I think is what I mean.
03:01:05 Like she would need. I agree.
03:01:07 She would need it to be like genuinely unsettling for her to actually like it.
03:01:12 So right.
03:01:12 And if it's if it's if it's a normal if it's a normie kind of cute,
03:01:16 she's like, yeah, OK, OK, sis.
03:01:18 Agreed 100 percent.
03:01:20 And I think that rules and I hope and I hope that we get to see.
03:01:23 I hope that we get to see this just it completely not work on her
03:01:26 because I think that's what that's what would happen.
03:01:30 No, yeah, if it worked on Lilith, it would probably work on Nami.
03:01:35 I think.
03:01:36 Although Lilith might be like.
03:01:39 Lilith seems kind of like hyper emotional or she seems very
03:01:42 she seems very emotional and prone to like yelling and stuff.
03:01:45 Nami is a little more calculating, but she's might still.
03:01:49 I honestly think Nami is a little prone to yelling and emotional as well.
03:01:53 Yeah, yeah, she she's she's one of the ones along
03:01:58 with Zoro Zoro and Usopp and Chopper will always scream at stuff.
03:02:03 You're you're right, actually. And Brooke as well.
03:02:06 I think Zoro would probably because Zoro
03:02:10 yeah, has this like.
03:02:13 Memory of like a young girl that like died and that he like traumatized him.
03:02:18 I feel like he probably would be vulnerable to little little boa being like,
03:02:22 oh, it hurts.
03:02:25 Yeah, I think I'm thinking I'm thinking Robin would just yeah, see through it.
03:02:31 So that's so cool.
03:02:32 I hope I hope we get to see that.
03:02:36 Anyway, that I just wanted to say one more thing.
03:02:40 The top with Caesar and George.
03:02:45 They hate Vegapunk.
03:02:46 I had I think Cassidy in in your chat was hinting
03:02:52 that it could be Caesar with the gun.
03:02:56 Oh, or Josh Caesar is the one who has used a gun before as a weapon.
03:03:03 I yeah, when did he the thing is, though, how did he how would he have got here?
03:03:12 Well, you know, that's the thing.
03:03:13 He is a scientist, so I know he could probably science his way in
03:03:19 and he can fly himself, I think.
03:03:21 Yeah, can he just fly like from island to island?
03:03:25 I I think so.
03:03:26 I don't really know.
03:03:27 I think it's really fucking good cloud his his his poison cloud fruit
03:03:31 means he can fly a bit, but he needs to land at some point.
03:03:34 I don't think that was ever explained, but that's how I assume.
03:03:38 If he could just travel between islands with no ship,
03:03:41 like that would be like amazing, amazing capability of that fruit.
03:03:46 But then like, why couldn't smoke or do that?
03:03:49 Could smoke or do that?
03:03:50 Or would he get tired and have to lay out?
03:03:51 Yeah, I think it's yeah, it's probably there's limits to how much
03:03:56 you can you can do that and fly and whatever smokers got.
03:04:01 Can a could could ace just turn into a cloud of fire and go from island to island?
03:04:05 No, he had to use that little that little like rocket propelled sailboat.
03:04:11 Yeah, yeah. So I could I could see it being Caesar.
03:04:15 Yeah, I could see it being Caesar.
03:04:16 And, you know, he got here somehow when no one was paying attention.
03:04:21 Because like that flashback or that that cover story is like
03:04:25 as soon as they left whole cake.
03:04:27 Meanwhile, everyone else was in Wano doing Wano stuff.
03:04:30 Yeah. So there's potentially a lot of time
03:04:33 to judge and Caesar to hatch a plan to infiltrate Egghead
03:04:37 and do some some some little sneaky, you know what?
03:04:40 Totally plausible.
03:04:43 Think the Stussy theory makes sense.
03:04:46 But I mean, you know, this.
03:04:49 It would make sense for for us to be the motivation makes sense.
03:04:52 Yeah, plus it would just like, oh,
03:04:54 that's why we've been seeing it in the cover arc story.
03:04:57 It's like, OK, because it's going to be immediately relevant to
03:05:01 what's what's happening on the island.
03:05:04 Yeah, that's pretty good.
03:05:08 I buy it. So and if he and if he's here,
03:05:11 then probably judges here too, right, maybe.
03:05:15 Yeah, I don't know why they would both be like physically together.
03:05:20 Yeah, I feel like Caesar would be sneaking around.
03:05:22 Judge would be nearby with his ships.
03:05:27 And that's probably not necessary.
03:05:29 Probably not.
03:05:30 I really don't know, because it's sort of like they want to get back at Vega Punk.
03:05:35 Therefore, what do they do?
03:05:38 What are they doing right now?
03:05:40 Caesar might be they are doing that assassinating people.
03:05:46 Or he's assassinating the people.
03:05:49 He's got control of the seraphim.
03:05:51 If they're not here doing this, then I don't know what they are doing.
03:05:55 Yeah, why would say why would Caesar have control of the seraphim?
03:06:00 That's why Stussy would have the control,
03:06:02 because she had the little yeah, this CP zero thing.
03:06:07 But wouldn't Vega Punk's orders supersede her orders, though?
03:06:11 That's the thing that's confusing.
03:06:13 I would only I would assume that either Stussy knows how to operate
03:06:19 the computers and change the programming somehow or Caesar does.
03:06:24 The only thing that's weird about Caesar being here is.
03:06:32 If surely he knows that Luffy is here or he will find out
03:06:38 and he's fucking terrified of the straw hats because they beat the shit out of him.
03:06:43 Right.
03:06:44 And they forced him to collaborate with him and their their assassination of big mom.
03:06:50 I think so, eventually.
03:06:52 Yeah.
03:06:57 Maybe, I mean, it could I guess it could still be a fake assassination
03:07:01 and like Stussy and Chaka are like collaborating.
03:07:05 For what purpose, though?
03:07:06 They've been collecting agents.
03:07:08 I mean, well, that would explain how how the seraphim are in their control
03:07:16 because Chaka is Vega Punk.
03:07:18 And so Chaka has basically the highest authorization to order them.
03:07:23 True.
03:07:24 So that would that could explain that.
03:07:29 Because without without.
03:07:30 Yeah, without without a Vega Punk giving orders,
03:07:32 there's no real explanation for why Vega Punk can't just tell the seraphim to stop.
03:07:38 Did they didn't they say and didn't they say there was some line about like.
03:07:46 The set like one seraphim one CP zero can't like contradict another one's orders.
03:07:53 Like like like once one had given an order, another CP can't just call it off.
03:07:58 Like an even higher order has to be given for it to change.
03:08:02 Yeah, I think they did say something like that.
03:08:04 I feel like they said something like that, which would which if true would mean that
03:08:07 like if Chaka says something, then Vega Punk, no other Vega Punk can intercede
03:08:12 because there's no higher authority would have to carry that one out before another order could be given.
03:08:18 That's crazy.
03:08:19 So so I don't know.
03:08:21 That makes me think maybe Chaka actually is faking his death.
03:08:28 You want to you want to go voice mails?
03:08:30 Yeah.
03:08:31 Well, let's do a little voicemail.
03:08:36 Speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.
03:08:39 If you want to leave a PCP voicemail.
03:08:45 OK, there's not there's not that many.
03:08:47 He's a normal amount.
03:08:49 OK. First one image, we got an image from Prince Isolation.
03:08:55 I think it's OK.
03:09:03 It's me.
03:09:06 Oh, I think these are stream moments.
03:09:09 Oops, threw up a little and then get it.
03:09:19 Oh, I'm.
03:09:21 I'm asking who about a little green gummy little green gummy bear while Munchy is benching 500 behind me.
03:09:31 That's true.
03:09:32 That's true.
03:09:34 Oh, God, my potassium.
03:09:35 Yeah, I keep having like weird heart palpitations and complaining about them on stream.
03:09:42 And then game gamers tavern instructed me on stream that I should get more potassium.
03:09:48 And then I can he had a similar issue once and that potassium helped.
03:09:51 So I've been trying to eat more bananas.
03:09:55 And then don't trust anyone.
03:09:57 They will always betray you.
03:09:58 True, true, true.
03:10:02 Give I'm watching you.
03:10:04 Don't worry.
03:10:05 I'll betray you.
03:10:07 Aha.
03:10:08 I knew it.
03:10:09 You can trust me to do that.
03:10:10 Thank you.
03:10:11 Thank you for proving me right.
03:10:12 There we go.
03:10:13 Oh, thank you.
03:10:15 I knew you'd come through for me.
03:10:17 Grievance hashtag and I'm grievance number 2793 on September 5th, 2016.
03:10:23 Trixie.
03:10:24 I assume that's as Trixie did this, this, this and this.
03:10:26 Yes, yes, yes.
03:10:27 I'm a very.
03:10:28 Yes, I am a very cantankerous and generally unpleasant person.
03:10:32 It's true.
03:10:35 Anyway, let's move on to the next one.
03:10:39 It's another image and a voicemail from Prince's isolation again.
03:10:44 God, not another one.
03:10:46 Oh, this is.
03:10:48 Oh, this is give.
03:10:51 Oh, little Pikmin.
03:10:54 Martha's going to die.
03:10:57 Oh, this is from my stream.
03:11:01 Did you carve a pumpkin and put it on your head?
03:11:04 Oh, it's because you have the V2.
03:11:07 Hey guys, let's play Fire Emblem.
03:11:10 Always with it.
03:11:11 There's so many reinforcements.
03:11:15 I've only watched you play Fire Emblem one time and boy, it sure does take a while.
03:11:22 It does.
03:11:23 Boy, it sure does take a while to play it, to do a battle.
03:11:25 Yeah.
03:11:26 Just like in real life.
03:11:28 Yeah, that's true.
03:11:29 I don't remember the Pikmin.
03:11:30 What was the Pikmin from?
03:11:32 Yeah.
03:11:34 Why are you holding a Pikmin?
03:11:37 I would say that though.
03:11:38 I would say.
03:11:44 It's a little Pikmin in real life.
03:11:47 Oh my God.
03:11:49 Yeah.
03:11:50 All right, let's listen to the voicemail.
03:11:53 Three, two, one, go.
03:11:56 Oh, I just realized that I haven't contextualized the last image that I sent.
03:12:00 So that is, you know, been streaming.
03:12:04 And so the next one, this one is Gib streaming, you know, as I made some eclectic fan art
03:12:13 of these two content creators streaming.
03:12:17 Aren't I original?
03:12:18 Aren't I just the most fucking original fan in the world?
03:12:23 Okay, enjoy.
03:12:25 We did.
03:12:27 I did have a little moment where I said, oh, I threw up a little bit in my mouth because
03:12:31 it just happened.
03:12:32 I don't know why I'm saying Kieris to this.
03:12:35 I think it's a gummy bear.
03:12:37 Maybe I'm just generally contemplating the gummy that is something I would do.
03:12:44 I did at one point step away and through my fridge and eat some and eat some gummies that
03:12:48 I just had sitting around.
03:12:51 One of these days, one of these days, how much do you think I should sell like a pound
03:12:57 of gummies for like, like 25 bucks?
03:13:00 25 bucks a pound?
03:13:01 I can't visualize a pound of something.
03:13:04 I think it would be like a sort of a big handful size, you know, maybe like the size of like
03:13:11 a roll of toilet paper.
03:13:12 Yeah, probably smaller than that.
03:13:15 A little smaller than a roll of toilet paper, but like a little plastic bag filled with
03:13:20 little gummies in it.
03:13:21 Yeah.
03:13:22 25.
03:13:23 25 bucks?
03:13:24 Seems kind of steep, but I guess candy is just cheap.
03:13:27 So.
03:13:28 I mean, I mean, a pound is a lot.
03:13:30 A pound is a lot.
03:13:32 We've eaten that for a while.
03:13:34 Well, I mean, I wouldn't, but most people would.
03:13:37 You know, I'll try to see like how much it would actually cost me to make.
03:13:41 You know, as always, I'll have to, I'll have to find, figure out the cost and then, and
03:13:46 then figure out price from there.
03:13:50 These are.
03:13:51 Yeah, I mean, you'll be like competing with candy factories that can make billions of
03:13:57 candies with one cent of production.
03:14:02 Yeah.
03:14:03 I can't, I can't really compete on, I can't really compete on economy of scale.
03:14:09 So I'll have to make them cute.
03:14:10 I'll have to make them cute and funny somehow.
03:14:12 And like.
03:14:14 Cute little.
03:14:16 Like people, I don't feel like people would need gummies in bulk.
03:14:20 They could buy little packets and then you could have the price, you could mark the
03:14:23 price up so that they, they're like, Oh, it's only a couple bucks.
03:14:27 But like.
03:14:29 Scaled up.
03:14:30 It would be sound, it would sound like an unreasonable number, but scaled down.
03:14:34 It's a cute little package.
03:14:36 A cute little package.
03:14:37 But I mean, if I were buying some gummies, like on a Kickstarter, I would hope to get
03:14:41 like a pretty large amount.
03:14:43 I would hope.
03:14:44 Yeah.
03:14:45 That's what I was thinking to do a Kickstarter.
03:14:47 We're like, Hey, who, anyone who buys a pound of gummies, like if I can sell like
03:14:51 20 pounds of these, then like, we're good.
03:14:53 You should sell them.
03:14:54 I would, I would say, I would set the, I would set the goal to like, I would set the goal
03:14:59 to like 50 bucks.
03:15:02 And then like anything over and above that is just, is just gravy.
03:15:08 I don't know.
03:15:10 Yeah.
03:15:11 So I was a bit of a different beast making a food product for Kickstarter.
03:15:15 Yeah.
03:15:16 On, you know, I just, it would be inconvenient to make little packets cause like it's kind
03:15:21 of like, why do I even want to bother with making like a $5 sale?
03:15:25 Like I got to go all the way to the fricking post office.
03:15:28 No.
03:15:29 Yeah, I get it.
03:15:30 Yeah.
03:15:31 I'm just thinking of like in a shop, like a little packet of something, not like a tiny
03:15:36 thing, but like to get, to get the size of a Haribo gummy bear packet.
03:15:41 Yeah.
03:15:42 Yeah.
03:15:43 If I was putting them in shops, that would be a whole different story.
03:15:46 That's like a whole process to do that that I don't even, I don't even understand.
03:15:52 And this is all off topic.
03:15:54 Thank you, Prince, for the fan, for the fan art.
03:15:57 Thank you.
03:15:58 For the stream moments.
03:15:59 I like mine a lot.
03:16:00 I really appreciate it.
03:16:01 It's cool.
03:16:02 Okay.
03:16:03 Next one is called literally world ending user experience three, two, one go.
03:16:08 Ben on stcomics.com.
03:16:10 I noticed that the Beescapades when you're reading Beescapades, the tab, the name of
03:16:15 the tab says the vapors instead of Beescapades.
03:16:18 All the other products are correct, but I guess you forgot to change that one when you
03:16:22 made up page.
03:16:23 So I don't know if you want to fix it or something.
03:16:26 I don't know.
03:16:27 Okay.
03:16:28 Bye.
03:16:29 Bye.
03:16:30 Yeah.
03:16:31 I didn't thank you for, I'm going to put that in my notes.
03:16:34 I actually noticed there's a couple of broken links.
03:16:37 So pages 83 and 90 and 106 have like, like their next button is like broken, which sucks.
03:16:45 So that's not good.
03:16:47 That's not good.
03:16:48 I have to, I have to fix that.
03:16:50 I will get on that.
03:16:52 I'll do that at some point after maybe when I'm, maybe when I'm actually drawing it or
03:16:58 something, I'll, I'll, I'll get around to fixing that.
03:17:00 It's actually not, it's not hard to fix at all.
03:17:02 Actually, actually it would take me literally like five minutes.
03:17:05 Maybe I'll just do it right after this.
03:17:07 If I remember.
03:17:11 Next one is called a but a epic comic smiley face.
03:17:14 Three, two, one, go.
03:17:16 Also two things.
03:17:17 I just read the escapades for the first time and it was so good.
03:17:20 Why didn't I read it sooner?
03:17:22 It's so funny and adventurous and engaging and the mechanics are great and the diction
03:17:27 is so awesome.
03:17:28 Then you feel good about it and yourself for making it.
03:17:33 On three pages, there were technical issues with the website on 83 and 90.
03:17:38 That's what I just said.
03:17:39 Next buttons that were below the page, the comic page, didn't have the right links.
03:17:44 And then on page 106, it shows that there's a second image, but it isn't loading.
03:17:48 That's the.
03:17:49 So yeah, that's, that's still Rob.
03:17:52 That's what I fucking comic anyway.
03:17:54 Okay.
03:17:55 Hey, good catch.
03:17:56 Too bad I caught them all first idiot.
03:18:00 You say with those websites still broken.
03:18:03 Yeah.
03:18:04 Yeah.
03:18:05 Yeah, it's still broken, but like I knew it was broken this whole time.
03:18:09 Don't you look like a fool now.
03:18:11 Um, Lamal.
03:18:13 Okay.
03:18:14 Next one is called Kaga D's nuts.
03:18:16 Three, two, one, go.
03:18:19 Catching up on my PCP and I noticed that give has been playing some fire emblem.
03:18:26 Yeah.
03:18:27 You're not already aware.
03:18:28 There's this neat little PlayStation game called caring saga made by the creator of
03:18:34 the series shows a Kaga, AKA the guy that Nintendo desperately wants to erase from
03:18:41 existence.
03:18:42 Like he wasn't even named at all in the 30th anniversary art book collection for fire
03:18:49 emblem.
03:18:50 So that's a little bit fucked up at least they had the dignity to credit him for
03:18:56 the switch release of the first fire emblem.
03:18:59 So that's something I guess.
03:19:02 But anyway, caring saga literally just PlayStation fire emblem.
03:19:08 It's got these gorgeous right works.
03:19:12 Um, animation is not nearly as cool as a GBA games, but you know, it looks nice in
03:19:17 its own way and it's a fun little rock.
03:19:20 I highly recommend.
03:19:22 Okay.
03:19:23 I'm looking at it.
03:19:26 Tearing.
03:19:27 I thought you said curing.
03:19:32 It's the caring saga.
03:19:35 We care about this.
03:19:37 We care about you, the player.
03:19:40 Oh, little tiny fruit fly.
03:19:42 No.
03:19:43 All of these images I'm finding on Google are very, very small, but I will post one
03:19:47 anyway.
03:19:49 So I can see what I'm looking at.
03:19:51 So like it's like little guys, little RPG.
03:19:58 Oh, look at him.
03:20:03 Wait a minute.
03:20:04 Look at his face.
03:20:07 Oh, this is a better image.
03:20:09 So yeah, it's grid based, but it's individual.
03:20:13 They're zoomed in.
03:20:14 So they're more like people.
03:20:16 I'm sorry.
03:20:17 All I can see is the weird tangent of how like the line of his collar leads directly into
03:20:23 the line that I think is his mouth.
03:20:26 And that's just bad.
03:20:28 That's just bad design.
03:20:29 That's just bad illustration work right there.
03:20:32 That's a right angle.
03:20:34 Can I have right angle?
03:20:36 No, it's like the one line becomes the other line in a very way that is making me think
03:20:43 I'm seeing some sort of an illusion.
03:20:46 Don't like it.
03:20:48 What is this called?
03:20:49 Curing saga?
03:20:50 Tearing saga?
03:20:51 Tear.
03:20:52 Like I'm crying about it.
03:20:56 Okay, so what are we going to do about this?
03:20:59 I'm going to cry about it.
03:21:01 What's the solution?
03:21:02 I'm not going to play it for the Fire Emblem series, but I will probably have a look at
03:21:07 it because this looks nice.
03:21:09 There's a game that a bunch of people have recommended me.
03:21:12 I'm drawing a blank on what it's called, but somebody made a...
03:21:15 Super Mario Brothers 2.
03:21:18 No, it's somebody made an indie battle network.
03:21:22 It's called something like...
03:21:25 Butthole network.
03:21:26 Love is in the heart or something.
03:21:28 That's not what it's called.
03:21:30 Indie battle network, one step from Eden.
03:21:35 A couple people have recommended me a game called One Step From Eden.
03:21:38 I think they might have even had a voicemail about it.
03:21:41 But I have not looked at it, but I will probably check it out at some point.
03:21:46 Next one is an image.
03:21:49 What is...
03:21:52 Let's see.
03:21:53 Is this a reference to something?
03:21:56 I don't quite understand.
03:21:59 Yeah, I'm not...
03:22:00 I mean, I ate my food and I'm big and fat.
03:22:03 And I didn't finish my food and I'm a skeleton.
03:22:07 Why didn't you finish your food?
03:22:09 You could have averted this.
03:22:10 I don't know. I guess I like skeletons too much.
03:22:16 This reminds me...
03:22:17 Isn't there like a meme or something that's like...
03:22:20 Big fat capital...
03:22:22 This is like a big fat capitalist who's like telling one guy with one...
03:22:26 There's like a black guy with no cookies and there's like a white guy with one cookie
03:22:30 and the capitalist is telling the black guy like that guy.
03:22:32 No, no, he tells the white guy that guy wants to take your cookie.
03:22:36 The capitalist has like a huge plate piled up with cookies or something.
03:22:41 I feel like this reminds me of...
03:22:44 I like the skeleton. The skull is a cool...
03:22:46 The skeleton looks really cool actually.
03:22:49 The angle on it looks good.
03:22:52 It's like our logo.
03:22:54 It's like our new logo to soon to debut.
03:22:56 Oh my god.
03:22:57 Spoilers!
03:22:58 Wow!
03:22:59 Broilers?
03:23:01 Is that like black pudding or is that a sausage?
03:23:05 I thought it was like toast.
03:23:08 It looks like a biscotti.
03:23:11 You know biscotti?
03:23:12 Yeah, I thought it was a lighter color.
03:23:16 Yeah.
03:23:17 But it's shaped like one.
03:23:20 If it's a sausage, why is it off your plate?
03:23:23 You sloppy fuck.
03:23:26 Look.
03:23:27 Just throwing your food around.
03:23:28 Yeah, I was just playing with it and I died.
03:23:31 Turned to a skeleton.
03:23:33 You were too busy tossing your biscotti around.
03:23:37 You couldn't bother to be asked to take a bite of it.
03:23:40 I like how you're just pointing at it.
03:23:44 Maybe I'm asking, are you going to eat that?
03:23:46 Yeah, it looks like you're saying that but I'm dead so I can't speak.
03:23:50 You're going to eat that?
03:23:51 Hey buddy, are you going to eat that?
03:23:53 Nope.
03:23:54 Don't mind if I do.
03:23:56 It's just sort of like if it was like, oh Ben eats so much that I starve to death.
03:24:01 But my food is still there.
03:24:03 Ben has not done this.
03:24:05 I have not done this to you.
03:24:07 You did this to yourself and I'm just here to capitalize on it.
03:24:11 Well, true words.
03:24:14 Gabe, if you died, would you let me eat your egg and biscotti?
03:24:17 Yeah.
03:24:18 Yeah, thank you.
03:24:21 This might happen one day.
03:24:24 Oh no.
03:24:25 And I'm going to need to know that I have your consent.
03:24:29 That means if I ever have a breakfast that consists of a single fried egg and a bit of biscotti,
03:24:34 that means somebody's out there with a sniper rifle.
03:24:38 You have to put the meal down and immediately exit the building.
03:24:44 Sick.
03:24:45 All right, the next one is a vocaru.
03:24:49 You ready?
03:24:50 Yep.
03:24:51 All right, three, two, one, go.
03:24:54 Checking Twitter, doing what I do.
03:24:57 A new picture of Gibbente.
03:25:08 Oh my God.
03:25:09 Fast.
03:25:10 Yeah, what's going on?
03:25:12 Wow.
03:25:13 Wow, it doesn't sound healthy.
03:25:16 Did I even put a picture of myself lately?
03:25:21 I don't think I've seen a new one that lately.
03:25:24 The last one was like the, wait, wait, wait, there was the one of you and you could just
03:25:30 just the back of your head, but you could sort of see your face in the mirror.
03:25:33 No.
03:25:34 Was it that one?
03:25:35 Yeah, it was a selfie.
03:25:36 I thought that one was pretty funny.
03:25:39 No, it was cool.
03:25:41 Yeah.
03:25:42 Not funny.
03:25:44 It was funny that like you can only just barely see your face.
03:25:48 Oh yeah, a little bit.
03:25:50 I was fucked up about like the hairs on the back of my neck.
03:25:55 I was like, oh shit, these feel like they go way down, like way too far down.
03:26:00 And I was like, shit, I got to find, I got to take a picture of the back of my neck to
03:26:04 confirm that I don't look like a freak back there.
03:26:07 Turns out look normal and it's fine.
03:26:10 But then it turns out that the image I took just happened to be nicely put together, I
03:26:17 was just sort of like, yeah, that's kind of an interesting image.
03:26:20 It's kind of like an alternative selfie.
03:26:23 An alternative selfie.
03:26:26 But with the regular kind.
03:26:29 I just won't do.
03:26:31 Sorry, I'm an hour behind on sleep because it was daylight savings time last night.
03:26:37 So that's, you have to, you have to excuse me.
03:26:42 The next one?
03:26:44 Yes, another vote.
03:26:46 Next one.
03:26:47 No, no, no, the next one is the mongoose.
03:26:49 Oh, that was that?
03:26:50 Yes.
03:26:51 Okay.
03:26:52 Yeah.
03:26:53 Three, two, one, go.
03:26:54 Yeah.
03:26:55 I don't know, Jesse.
03:26:57 You've been acting connoisseurs lately.
03:27:04 I mean, LeMau, I don't know.
03:27:09 What if the PCP was among us?
03:27:15 Who would be sus?
03:27:17 Who would be the imposter?
03:27:19 Who would be sus?
03:27:21 And who would win?
03:27:23 Vote now.
03:27:31 Jesse and Trixie, imposters, voting them out, throwing them in the air a lot.
03:27:36 That's my bid.
03:27:38 No, weird be the imposters because there's two of us.
03:27:42 We've been systematically picking off everyone, making them stop showing up to the show and
03:27:49 quit the server.
03:27:51 Yeah, we started with Jeff.
03:27:53 Was it Jeff kicked first?
03:27:56 He wasn't really kicked.
03:27:57 He wasn't really kicked.
03:27:58 He was sort of like, see you guys, yeah.
03:28:00 It was sort of like, yeah, this isn't really a thing.
03:28:03 And then we killed monkey, we stabbed him, got him with our alien face.
03:28:10 Yes.
03:28:11 Everyone came around like, oh, shit, there's a body.
03:28:13 What's going on?
03:28:14 There's a big old eye.
03:28:15 Right.
03:28:16 We just kept killing.
03:28:17 We just kept killing.
03:28:19 I mean, I think the only other official kill was Trixie, and that was suicide.
03:28:26 Trixie tripped out of the airlock.
03:28:29 Oh, no, DeVoo.
03:28:30 DeVoo also, I mean, we never found the body, so we don't know what happened to DeVoo.
03:28:36 Presumed suicide as well.
03:28:40 But I mean, that's the mark of a really excellent kill is that you think it was a suicide.
03:28:46 I like Amongus.
03:28:49 Me too.
03:28:52 Oh, Amongus.
03:28:55 I get it.
03:28:57 I get it.
03:28:59 Lol.
03:29:00 All right.
03:29:01 Next one is Kongalooia final.
03:29:05 Let's go.
03:29:07 Oh, the URL ends in bonk.
03:29:10 Oh, yeah.
03:29:12 That can't be a coincidence.
03:29:14 Yes, it can.
03:29:15 It absolutely can.
03:29:17 I don't think so.
03:29:19 All right.
03:29:20 Three, two, one, go.
03:29:37 Oh, oh, oh.
03:29:39 He made Mootslow.
03:29:41 He kept you high.
03:29:43 But this Kong is a fuck of a guy.
03:29:46 The number guy can make a cramlin' cry out.
03:29:51 Kongalooia.
03:29:55 Kongalooia.
03:29:59 Kongalooia.
03:30:03 Kongalooia.
03:30:08 Kongalooia.
03:30:12 Kongalooia.
03:30:15 Kongalooia.
03:30:20 Kongalooia.
03:30:23 Kongalooia.
03:30:29 Kongalooia.
03:30:30 Behold!
03:30:47 You just keepacking
03:31:00 Oh, let's be those pineapple scones.
03:31:07 Grace, now let's all reach a zen.
03:31:11 Don't you understand?
03:31:18 Oh, yeah.
03:31:24 Wow.
03:31:26 Nice.
03:31:28 It's just undeniable.
03:31:30 Yeah, it is nice.
03:31:32 He gave it his all.
03:31:34 He did.
03:31:36 And he did it.
03:31:38 The mad lad, he pulled it off.
03:31:40 I'd buy that on cassette tape.
03:31:42 I would buy that on eight track.
03:31:46 I would buy that on a disc.
03:31:49 I would buy that on a floppy.
03:31:52 I would buy it with a mouse.
03:31:54 I would buy it in a house.
03:31:56 Just an impressive level of execution on display on this little project.
03:32:03 All right.
03:32:05 I think we've got...
03:32:07 I think the next one might be related.
03:32:09 The next one is called,
03:32:11 A Reveal and an Announcement,
03:32:13 Dry Dump December at DustyDumps.com.
03:32:16 Three, two, one, go.
03:32:18 Hello, it is me, Dusty Dumps.
03:32:21 I hope you enjoyed the Kong Luya track.
03:32:23 The Saga, the Kong Luya Saga.
03:32:26 That waschly dump.
03:32:29 Well, anyway, I'm here to announce that the DZD Moysmel album
03:32:32 that I announced almost a year ago
03:32:34 is finally done and it's out now.
03:32:38 Yo!
03:32:40 It's on Bandcamp.
03:32:41 It's 23 tracks long
03:32:43 with wildly varying lengths from tracks that are like 10 seconds long
03:32:47 to epic seven-minute oddities.
03:32:50 Holy shit.
03:32:52 Our album exclusive, five of them are bonus tracks
03:32:55 that you can only get if you get the full album.
03:32:57 Each track comes with a little blurb describing the lore of the track
03:33:01 and the conception of it,
03:33:03 and each track also comes with lyrics.
03:33:05 You can sing along at home.
03:33:07 The album is at a pay what you want model
03:33:10 so you can pay me five billion dollars for it,
03:33:13 or just zero.
03:33:15 I think I will.
03:33:17 Oh, that rules.
03:33:19 The album includes tracks such as
03:33:21 B for Kringus Bingus,
03:33:23 The Tale of the Golden Witch,
03:33:25 the Natehead theme song,
03:33:27 Lord of Ghosts vs. King Herod,
03:33:29 and many, many more.
03:33:31 Check it out.
03:33:33 My next voicemail will just be a link to the album.
03:33:36 Okay, see ya. Bye. Hope you enjoy.
03:33:38 Thank you, David.
03:33:40 Thank you, Dusty Dumps.
03:33:43 I might have forgotten a couple of those.
03:33:46 I might go and refresh my memory.
03:33:49 All of these were played as voicemails.
03:33:51 Maybe there's some secrets.
03:33:53 He did say there were some exclusives.
03:33:55 Yeah, exclusives.
03:33:57 We should post this.
03:33:59 We'll definitely put it in the description.
03:34:01 Maybe we'll post this on Twitter,
03:34:03 or post this around.
03:34:05 I'm definitely going to pick it up,
03:34:07 and I'll probably drop,
03:34:09 probably pay.
03:34:11 I'll actually probably pay something.
03:34:13 Anyone that picks that up,
03:34:15 throw this guy a little bit.
03:34:17 Tip this guy for his...
03:34:19 for his...
03:34:21 all the work he's put into this.
03:34:23 I appreciate it a lot.
03:34:25 Awesome.
03:34:27 All right.
03:34:29 Mutsandu.bandcamp.com
03:34:31 That's from Mutsandu.
03:34:33 Kongeluya to you, sir.
03:34:35 I tip my hat.
03:34:39 Just great.
03:34:41 Great stuff.
03:34:43 You want to do the next one?
03:34:45 Cool.
03:34:47 Next one is an image.
03:34:49 Oh.
03:34:51 Okay.
03:34:53 Medical man.
03:34:55 It's a bunch of tweets of me asking
03:34:57 why isn't Medeker dead yet?
03:35:01 Oh, it's my...
03:35:03 it's my plebe and the weave,
03:35:05 hair, head image here.
03:35:07 With the soyjack
03:35:09 on it, of course.
03:35:11 Medeker is staying alive to own the libs.
03:35:13 I was just...
03:35:15 freaking...
03:35:17 Keemstar was like...
03:35:19 he's dying any day now.
03:35:21 He's on my show.
03:35:23 He's almost dead. He's going to be dead real soon.
03:35:25 Why would you trust a thing Keemstar says?
03:35:29 Oh, God, you're right.
03:35:31 I'm so stupid.
03:35:33 I'm so fucking stupid.
03:35:35 Damn it. Keemstar would say the most
03:35:37 entertaining thing.
03:35:39 That's not necessarily true.
03:35:41 I guess that would...
03:35:43 I guess it would be
03:35:45 get more people to watch if he was like,
03:35:47 this guy is going to be dead tomorrow.
03:35:49 And he's second now.
03:35:51 Tune in to watch him die alive.
03:35:53 Before the show, he was like,
03:35:55 hey, Medeker, what if I actually tell them
03:35:57 you're going to die?
03:35:59 What if we keep saying you're going to die?
03:36:01 And I say, no, this is it. No, this is it.
03:36:03 He'll be dead immediately after this
03:36:05 show concludes.
03:36:07 And he was like, yeah, tell him that.
03:36:09 The idiots will believe anything.
03:36:11 And they were right. I did.
03:36:13 Well,
03:36:15 consider this lib owned, I guess.
03:36:19 Next one is called Derriere.
03:36:21 Three, two, one, go.
03:36:23 Fucking tussle, bro.
03:36:25 You want to fight? I'll fight you to the last man.
03:36:27 And
03:36:29 I'll send a battalion.
03:36:31 I'll send a rap stallion
03:36:33 to your house to knife you.
03:36:35 And then
03:36:37 I'll invite you to
03:36:39 this coffin I've prepared
03:36:41 out
03:36:43 by your mother's derriere
03:36:45 in the field.
03:36:49 I'm going to kill you, Ben.
03:36:51 Damn, fuck.
03:36:53 By your mother's derriere in the field.
03:36:55 Was that
03:36:57 was that Ethan Ralph?
03:36:59 No, wait, why would it be?
03:37:01 I thought it sounded a little bit
03:37:03 like a Southern accent at the very end
03:37:05 there, but no.
03:37:07 Ethan Ralph was watching the PCP
03:37:09 and says, I guess my mom's dead.
03:37:11 Well, you know, because his baby
03:37:13 was the samurai, you know, it's
03:37:15 no, I thought you meant like the actual
03:37:19 Yeah, the actual Ethan Ralph
03:37:21 has an actual samurai
03:37:23 reincarnated.
03:37:25 Oh, wow. In the ghost of
03:37:27 Roseanne.
03:37:29 Whatever his fucking name is.
03:37:31 The
03:37:33 Well, I guess my mom's dead and she's
03:37:35 buried in the field and
03:37:37 there's going to be a battle. Bring it on.
03:37:39 It's going to send a battalion
03:37:41 and a rap scallion. Which one are you more
03:37:43 scared about?
03:37:45 I don't know, one good
03:37:47 one good rap scallion can really get
03:37:49 some work done.
03:37:51 Probably I could
03:37:53 be harder to defend myself against an
03:37:55 entire battalion, if I'm being honest.
03:37:57 My house is not like
03:37:59 positioned for like military defense.
03:38:01 So I'd probably be pretty weak to a frontal
03:38:03 assault.
03:38:05 Next one is called Bencon 4 3 2
03:38:07 1 go.
03:38:09 Do we actually know if anyone funded
03:38:11 Ratcon 4 because they wanted to see
03:38:13 more Bencene?
03:38:15 No.
03:38:17 No.
03:38:19 Wait, we don't know that.
03:38:21 It could be that everyone did that
03:38:23 for that reason. It could be
03:38:25 and it should be
03:38:27 but I can't prove it.
03:38:29 Nobody knows
03:38:31 at the end of the day. We only have hearsay
03:38:33 and speculation.
03:38:35 Next one is
03:38:37 called Sonic Review 3 2 1
03:38:39 go.
03:38:41 Sonic the Hedgehog is amazing.
03:38:43 I love everything about Sonic the Hedgehog.
03:38:45 He's blue.
03:38:47 He's fast.
03:38:49 He has an attitude
03:38:51 and he eats the same kind of food
03:38:53 that you and me do.
03:38:55 Hot dogs.
03:38:57 Chili dogs.
03:38:59 Really.
03:39:01 I love hedgehogs.
03:39:03 Just in general.
03:39:05 They're alright.
03:39:07 The only thing about it
03:39:09 is
03:39:11 I tried to play Sonic
03:39:13 and
03:39:15 I thought the point was to go fast
03:39:17 but like every time you build up
03:39:19 a little bit of speed you just ran into
03:39:21 something.
03:39:23 What was the point?
03:39:25 Didn't you watch the Davoo video?
03:39:39 That's one of those reviews I hear
03:39:41 all about. You gotta watch that
03:39:43 Davoo video where she talks about
03:39:45 how it's about
03:39:47 controlling your momentum
03:39:49 to get the big loops.
03:39:51 Blue Hedgehog's
03:39:53 Nightmares.
03:39:55 If only it was Green Hedgehog.
03:39:57 If you want to play a game
03:39:59 a man
03:40:01 after your own heart who wants a game
03:40:03 that's just about going fast
03:40:05 that's Oolulilia
03:40:07 that's Platform Masters.
03:40:09 Did you ever see footage of Platform Masters?
03:40:11 No.
03:40:13 He was making a game
03:40:15 for a while
03:40:17 and it was going to be called Platform Masters
03:40:19 and it was like
03:40:21 let me see if I can find a screenshot of it.
03:40:23 Oolulilia
03:40:25 Platform Masters
03:40:31 Yeah, here we go.
03:40:33 Platform Masters Development, New Forested Mountains.
03:40:37 Okay.
03:40:39 So basically
03:40:45 Platform Masters
03:40:47 is a game
03:40:49 where you just
03:40:53 where you just go
03:40:55 where you just hold the forward button
03:40:59 and go really fast.
03:41:01 There are platforms and there are objects to jump on
03:41:03 but
03:41:05 it's just about
03:41:07 accumulating a huge amount of speed
03:41:09 and getting really high
03:41:11 is pretty much the point of it.
03:41:13 Was he in the middle of a dive right there?
03:41:15 They were flying.
03:41:17 I think the idea is that
03:41:19 it literally works kind of like
03:41:21 a Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters
03:41:23 where your character just holds
03:41:25 their arms out and it makes them
03:41:27 and it makes them fly.
03:41:29 Oh, there's something I really like
03:41:31 about the way this looks.
03:41:33 If you watch
03:41:35 his logs where he talks about development
03:41:37 like
03:41:39 he's got the speed counter and the height counter
03:41:41 and pretty much
03:41:43 he designed the game
03:41:45 so that you could achieve tremendous
03:41:47 heights and outrageous speeds.
03:41:49 But
03:41:51 a lot of what he talks about
03:41:53 is about the parallax scrolling of the backgrounds
03:41:55 and he very carefully
03:41:57 calculated the distance
03:41:59 of every object in the background
03:42:01 and he made it parallax scroll
03:42:03 as you move in a
03:42:05 completely scientifically accurate way.
03:42:07 Even like there's one where you're on the moon
03:42:09 and you can see Earth
03:42:11 in the sky and the Earth will
03:42:13 parallax scroll very slowly
03:42:15 at a scientifically accurate rate
03:42:17 to you traveling like thousands of miles an hour
03:42:19 across the surface of the moon.
03:42:21 That's great.
03:42:23 Yeah, that's where
03:42:25 you really want your development resources going.
03:42:27 But yeah,
03:42:29 it's kind of Sonic inspired.
03:42:31 You can see there's little jump platforms.
03:42:35 Can I play it?
03:42:37 I don't think a playable version was ever released.
03:42:39 No, I like this.
03:42:41 I like how it looks. I just want to jump around in it.
03:42:43 I don't know,
03:42:45 but I think that all that ever surfaced of it
03:42:47 was videos of him
03:42:49 showing development progress.
03:42:51 Unfortunately.
03:42:53 I guess I'll watch those then.
03:42:55 Yeah, they're kind of...
03:42:57 It's interesting to hear him
03:42:59 just how focused he is
03:43:01 on the parallax scrolling
03:43:03 is remarkable.
03:43:07 I think that...
03:43:09 The next one is called
03:43:11 Funny Voice Mail.
03:43:13 Wait, hang on.
03:43:15 Yeah, 3, 2, 1, go.
03:43:17 So that last voicemail was kind of bad
03:43:19 and I kind of wish I didn't send it.
03:43:21 I thought it was a good jumping off point.
03:43:23 So, okay.
03:43:25 So if Sonic the Hedgehog
03:43:29 and Shadow the Hedgehog
03:43:31 were in a gay
03:43:33 romantic relationship,
03:43:35 do you think Sonic
03:43:37 would be the top or the bottom?
03:43:41 That was a nice break there.
03:43:43 He tried to keep a straight face.
03:43:45 He just blurred it out.
03:43:47 I'm not sure if that laugh
03:43:49 was part of the kayfabe or not.
03:43:53 I don't fucking know.
03:43:57 I think they'd both be tops
03:43:59 and that's why they can't... fuck.
03:44:01 No, Shadow was the bottom.
03:44:03 You think?
03:44:05 You'd be a bottom and then Maria
03:44:07 would be the top.
03:44:09 Well...
03:44:11 It's just how it is.
03:44:13 Is that like incest?
03:44:15 I don't...
03:44:17 I don't know anything about the story.
03:44:19 I just know that he likes Maria.
03:44:21 He likes Maria, but she died?
03:44:23 Is she a sister?
03:44:25 I don't...
03:44:27 I don't know.
03:44:29 I think maybe he was made in a lab
03:44:31 and she adopted him.
03:44:33 Maybe so they're probably not.
03:44:35 Look at them, they don't look blood related.
03:44:37 Yeah,
03:44:39 it's probably fine.
03:44:41 Shadow's clearly a bottom because he's
03:44:43 an underling.
03:44:45 Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.
03:44:47 Sorry.
03:44:49 I was going to say hedgehog.
03:44:51 He's a hedgehog?
03:44:57 He's an edgy boy,
03:44:59 but he just wants someone to love him.
03:45:01 Kind of shy.
03:45:07 Just by their very nature,
03:45:09 they curl up into a little bulb and someone comes close
03:45:11 and they're like, don't touch me.
03:45:13 Don't come near me.
03:45:15 Don't come near me.
03:45:17 That's what I say when I'm the top.
03:45:19 I say don't come near me.
03:45:21 Don't come in my sight, slave.
03:45:23 That's not true.
03:45:25 It's the other way around.
03:45:27 They say that to me.
03:45:31 I have nothing else to say about this stupid question.
03:45:33 Next one is called
03:45:35 How Angry Was Ben St.
03:45:37 This Episode Scale of 1 to 10?
03:45:39 I'm down to like a light 3.
03:45:41 I'm down to a strong 3 to a light 4.
03:45:43 I'm down to a 5.
03:45:45 I'm only at like 6 or 7.
03:45:47 It's going up.
03:45:49 How are you going to ask this question?
03:45:55 I'm down to like a normal.
03:45:57 I'm down to a manageable 3 or so.
03:45:59 That's where I put myself.
03:46:01 What do you think?
03:46:03 Am I right?
03:46:05 Yeah, I'd say you've calmed down.
03:46:07 I have calmed down.
03:46:09 I was at 9.
03:46:13 It was not a productive place to be.
03:46:17 I'm back.
03:46:19 Baby.
03:46:21 I'm back and better than ever.
03:46:23 Next one is called
03:46:25 A Little Pome for Y'all
03:46:27 Let's do one go.
03:46:29 This is not my voice.
03:46:31 Okay.
03:46:33 This is nothing more
03:46:35 than brief electrical impulses.
03:46:37 These that you hear right now
03:46:39 is not my voice.
03:46:41 It's true.
03:46:43 I am an invisible man
03:46:45 and whispers in your ear the news
03:46:47 that in my now you are invisible too.
03:46:51 Imagination games.
03:46:53 Don't tell us Mr. Sensible Guy.
03:46:55 I was always there among the crazy.
03:46:57 I see if we ever knew what a game was
03:46:59 or even what is imagination.
03:47:03 This is not my voice.
03:47:05 I am just whispering in your ear.
03:47:09 Fog Jesse Wood.
03:47:13 Okay.
03:47:17 That was a nice poem I guess.
03:47:19 That was a nice poem.
03:47:21 Right.
03:47:23 I don't want it.
03:47:25 I don't want to comment on the end part.
03:47:27 Next one is called
03:47:29 A May Neutral.
03:47:31 Next one is called Benefit of the Gib.
03:47:33 Three, two, one, go.
03:47:53 Yeah.
03:48:13 Yeah. I can take you more seriously
03:48:15 without the silly voice.
03:48:17 Yeah. I can't tell if
03:48:19 if this is a sincerely meant
03:48:21 sentiment or not.
03:48:23 Well they said it was sincere.
03:48:25 Well they said
03:48:27 they did use that word.
03:48:31 Is that a quote from someone else
03:48:33 or I mean
03:48:35 it's fair criticism.
03:48:37 I mean it's fair criticism.
03:48:39 I don't know.
03:48:41 I'm coping. I'm coping.
03:48:43 I'm trying to get better.
03:48:45 Ben because we used to do a podcast.
03:48:47 I know it's unproductive.
03:48:49 I know it can be
03:48:51 unproductive sometimes.
03:48:53 I know I get a little
03:48:55 heated over some things occasionally.
03:48:57 I know I hold grudges
03:48:59 for
03:49:01 whatever.
03:49:05 It's probably something I should be working on.
03:49:13 Try not to let it
03:49:15 try not to let it
03:49:17 hold me back from doing some things
03:49:19 that I'm trying to do.
03:49:21 Trying to get this
03:49:23 new video.
03:49:25 Trying to get another video out soon.
03:49:27 Do the comic party.
03:49:29 Rebrand the show.
03:49:31 We're moving forward.
03:49:33 We're moving forward.
03:49:35 It's the 90s.
03:49:37 Our music is about something now.
03:49:41 The 90s.
03:49:43 In the 90s.
03:49:45 Our music is about the 90s.
03:49:47 That's Alex Yeek.
03:49:49 If you're familiar.
03:49:51 He tells a
03:49:53 an old metalhead.
03:49:55 He's like ugh metal sucks.
03:49:57 It's all screaming.
03:49:59 It's the 90s. Our music is about something.
03:50:01 Our music is about things now.
03:50:05 Great. Great stuff.
03:50:07 Well shit that was the last voicemail.
03:50:09 Was it?
03:50:11 Being critical of me.
03:50:13 It's fine.
03:50:15 He's mean.
03:50:17 He was mean. He's mean to me.
03:50:19 Give.
03:50:21 Stop him.
03:50:23 Arrest him.
03:50:25 Arrest him.
03:50:27 I am not your policeman or woman.
03:50:29 Hmm.
03:50:31 Well.
03:50:33 I guess he'll get away.
03:50:35 With it.
03:50:37 I guess I can't do shit.
03:50:39 Didn't we have voice jail?
03:50:41 You could put him in there.
03:50:43 Put him in voicemail?
03:50:45 No.
03:50:47 You have to repent.
03:50:49 This is what you get.
03:50:51 You get voicemailers.
03:50:53 Maybe if he didn't put a funny filter on his voice
03:50:55 I would put him in voice jail.
03:50:57 But he did.
03:50:59 So it's okay.
03:51:01 All is forgiven.
03:51:03 That's it.
03:51:05 Thanks everyone for your voicemail.
03:51:07 I think.
03:51:09 What do you think?
03:51:11 I'm thinking we can have the website
03:51:13 more or less online
03:51:15 and pretty much done by next week.
03:51:17 Probably even by the time you listen to this.
03:51:19 And
03:51:21 I don't want to make any promises about
03:51:23 when the perfect planning
03:51:25 podcast will be out, but I will be
03:51:27 starting to work on
03:51:29 I'll be starting to draw more stuff.
03:51:31 I'll be starting to draw this week.
03:51:33 I can't put it off any longer.
03:51:35 And
03:51:37 And thanks for that guy who said
03:51:39 that he liked Biscopades. That means a lot to me
03:51:41 that somebody thought it was good.
03:51:43 Yeah, I liked it.
03:51:45 Thank you.
03:51:47 I'll do my best.
03:51:49 I need to write an outline.
03:51:51 What I need to do is take some notes
03:51:53 and outline okay. Here's where we're at in Biscopades.
03:51:55 Here are the elements that I had
03:51:57 previously introduced.
03:51:59 And then block out a little thing like okay.
03:52:01 Here's where I want the story to get
03:52:03 over the course of however many pages
03:52:05 of Biscopades I want to do. How many pages do you think
03:52:07 I should do? How many pages of Clarissa
03:52:09 do you want to put in?
03:52:11 There's
03:52:13 I think like 17 or 18
03:52:15 pages.
03:52:17 Okay.
03:52:19 You can do however many you want.
03:52:21 It doesn't need to be a big thing, but yeah.
03:52:23 Are you going to do it like standard comic page
03:52:25 format?
03:52:27 I will give you the template
03:52:29 for you to slot your images into.
03:52:31 Yeah, that would be.
03:52:33 That would be great.
03:52:35 There'll be
03:52:37 a left or a right page.
03:52:39 Okay, cool.
03:52:41 So you can put things in margins and stuff.
03:52:43 Yeah, give me that.
03:52:47 Yes.
03:52:49 This is the week that I get cracking on that.
03:52:51 Yes.
03:52:53 I will
03:52:55 I guess make that
03:52:57 PDF.
03:52:59 And then also next week maybe
03:53:01 I'm going to take
03:53:03 book.
03:53:05 I think the website will come before
03:53:07 the Amazon thing.
03:53:09 Oh, you mean the Clarissa
03:53:11 book?
03:53:13 Yeah, for my
03:53:15 end of things.
03:53:17 Because
03:53:19 that would be great.
03:53:21 I don't even know if it works
03:53:23 outside of the U.S.
03:53:25 It might just be a U.S.
03:53:27 specific Amazon
03:53:29 that's fine. At least a bunch of people
03:53:31 can buy it.
03:53:33 I'd be surprised
03:53:35 if Amazon wouldn't ship to the U.K.
03:53:37 Yeah.
03:53:39 I would also be surprised,
03:53:41 but I think it was on Amazon.com
03:53:43 not .co.uk, but I guess
03:53:45 Amazon.com is the main one.
03:53:47 Yeah.
03:53:49 So I don't know. I still got lots of
03:53:51 guides to read
03:53:53 on the thing like how to
03:53:55 upload your thing and what's the
03:53:57 specifications.
03:53:59 That's just a lot of stuff.
03:54:03 I know what you mean.
03:54:05 I know what you mean.
03:54:07 Yeah.
03:54:09 Um,
03:54:11 all right.
03:54:13 Let's put
03:54:15 our nose to the grindstones.
03:54:17 They're the next week on the Pro Crastinators
03:54:19 podcast.
03:54:21 Patreon.com.
03:54:23 If you want bonus episodes, if you want behind
03:54:25 the scenes,
03:54:27 discussion to listen to
03:54:29 if you want to have your name
03:54:31 in the thank you
03:54:33 page of the upcoming
03:54:35 periodical.
03:54:37 We'll be doing that.
03:54:39 And
03:54:41 anything else
03:54:43 before we end?
03:54:45 Patreon.com.
03:54:47 I don't even know if you said that.
03:54:49 I think I did, but it's okay.
03:54:51 We can say it again.
03:54:53 Follow me on Twitch
03:54:55 and Gib.
03:54:57 Give and take on Twitch.
03:54:59 Thank you
03:55:01 for listening and we'll see you next week.
03:55:03 Goodbye.
