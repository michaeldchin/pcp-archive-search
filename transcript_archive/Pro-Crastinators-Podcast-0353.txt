00:00:00 I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch...
00:00:11 ...on account of three say sink. One, two, three, sink!
00:00:19 Really? Wait. One, two, three sink!
00:00:24 Why are you so far behind?
00:00:26 I'm thinking man. All right. Internet slow, I guess. I guess. Uh, all right. Um, welcome
00:00:38 everybody to the procrastinators podcast. It's me and Gib and cheesy manfredo. And all
00:00:48 right, bye. That's the end of the episode. I guess nobody has anything to say. Bye. I
00:00:52 thought cheesy was going to say something. I thought cheesy was going to say hello. Hey,
00:00:56 cheesy. I said hello. Give them before the episode. Give them before the episode started.
00:01:07 See, cheesy doesn't even know. Cheesy, what the fuck? Gib, what do I do?
00:01:13 Yes, we can hear you. Can you guys hear me? Cheesy. No, I mean, yes. Cheesy can't hear us,
00:01:18 I guess. God, I'm going to punch my fucking window. Jesus. I can hear you. No, you fucking
00:01:25 can't hear you. Stop lying. I can hear you guys. No, you can't. What's, then why didn't you answer?
00:01:32 What's a damn job? Oh, God, I answered. We didn't hear the answer, I guess. I answered the call.
00:01:40 You answered. No. Yeah. You asked to be on the show when you said show. I gave an answer.
00:01:47 Yeah, I did. I think you're just like 20 seconds behind us. And now I'm here. Your audio may be
00:01:53 getting cut off and also you're applying like very late to what we're saying. Yeah, we can't,
00:01:58 we can't do it. We can't do it like this. We can't do it like this. I think it's it. Okay, you know
00:02:03 what? Give me one quick second. You got to go to the internet router and turn it on.
00:02:14 God, I hope it's, I hope that's the solution.
00:02:19 Perfect, perfect time to log my breakfast calories since I forgot to.
00:02:24 One tub of marinara cheese. Close. Two chub tubs of marinara cheese.
00:02:39 It was oats, actually, but close, close. Oats. From the Scottish Highlands.
00:02:48 What? The Scottish Highlands, you know, where the oats come from. You said Scottish,
00:02:53 but I heard it as Squish from the Squish Highlands. The Squish Highlands.
00:03:00 Where they toss the kebab. Where they toss the, where they toss it a pizza. Where they,
00:03:06 where they toss it, they hand toss it a mozzarella and the dough and the cheese and the tomatoes.
00:03:11 Hey, I'm walking here in Italy. New York style. New York style,
00:03:19 Italian, authentic rustic Italian style marinara pizza.
00:03:27 They don't say, hey, I'm walking here in Italy. They say, hey, I'm walking here and then. No,
00:03:33 they don't care about going quick. They're just, they're just sort of, they're walking here and
00:03:38 they're like, hey, nice to see you. Hey, mozzarella or whatever they say. Hey, mozzarella. I hardly
00:03:45 know her. I'm walking here. Good old racism. Good old, like, cultural, cultural racism.
00:03:55 When I don't have anything funny to say, I just pick a minority and I just, then I just start
00:04:02 beating on them. I just start mailing on them. Fuck them.
00:04:14 Fuck. You guys can start. Just give me a second. Okay. Cheesy will try again.
00:04:20 I guess let's just start talking. Cheesy, she's got to get his shit together, man.
00:04:25 All right. Here's what, I don't know. I don't know if he always has these connections issues,
00:04:33 but Cheesy's mic is dog shit. He needs a decent mic if he's going to keep podcasting.
00:04:39 He's got to upgrade. What does he even have? I don't know, but it does not sound good. It's
00:04:45 not podcast quality. Like even like a blue snowball, like a baby USB mic. It sounds better, I think.
00:04:54 Yeah. Yeah. There's probably like, that was like the good mic for beginners a long time ago.
00:05:01 There's probably like really good for the same price. I know it's out there for beginners.
00:05:07 Not not even that long ago, I saw a thread on Twitter of someone being like,
00:05:13 it was really annoying. Someone was like, guys, if you're if you're trying to get into a voice
00:05:21 acting or any kind or any kind of content creation, don't cheap out with the blue yeti.
00:05:26 You know, you need, you should invest in your future. You should, you should invest, you should
00:05:31 actually invest the money that you need to be doing to like to be sounding good. And I mean,
00:05:38 first thing, no, no, unless unless you're doing like professional quality voice acting and the bar
00:05:46 is really high or you're doing ASMR videos or something, nobody gives a shit. If you're just
00:05:51 making shit for YouTube, nobody gives a shit. You can, you can use a snowball. I did use a
00:05:57 snowball on the PCP for like two years and nobody's even going to 95 people are not even going to
00:06:04 notice the percent of people are going to notice the difference. And then of course, of course,
00:06:08 it turned out that this freak, this was like a tube or something, but this freak had like
00:06:12 Amazon links and was like an affiliate with a bunch of like microphone companies and stuff.
00:06:17 So of course, she's spreading this fucking hogwash that like you if you're if you're using a blue
00:06:22 yeti, you've already failed, right? False false. Yeah, voice acting, potentially, you're a good
00:06:31 idea to invest in your future because if you do get a job, if it's specifically in voice acting
00:06:36 or ASMR, then maybe you might benefit from like a really high stream. No, like you can
00:06:42 start out with like is going to give a budget stuff. That's no problem.
00:06:47 Like I guess we're recording. Yeah, I guess I guess we've started now.
00:06:53 Ellie is our cut out as much of the anger as would make for the as would keep the pace of this
00:06:59 podcast brisk, but also funny. So I released a video. What? Oh, yes. Oh, I was just going to say
00:07:08 I released my YouTube video advertising my Twitch stream, as I've been saying, I wanted to do
00:07:15 for a while. Why didn't I see that? When did you do that just today? Just like an hour ago.
00:07:20 Well, two hours, an hour and a half ago. Now, yeah. The the conversion rate, okay, it's not,
00:07:27 you know, it's only got a couple hundred views, but the conversion rate of like Twitch follows
00:07:32 to views on it is like really high. I've gained, hang on, it's got it's got about 300 views now.
00:07:40 I think it's it's like an hour and a half old 300 318 views and I've gained 23 followers.
00:07:48 I mean, that's I wonder. I wonder if that ratio will be maintained.
00:07:55 I mean, it makes sense. You got a lot of subscribers and viewers from
00:08:02 the metal man, the metal man, the metal metal man video, you know, I should make a separate
00:08:07 the lore of metal man.
00:08:10 Nine hours long. But like those people, they don't necessarily do more than subscribe. They might
00:08:18 not go to check your Twitter, they might not know anything else about you. So the best way to get
00:08:22 them to know about stuff is to make a YouTube video. That I mean, yeah, definitely, definitely.
00:08:28 That was the it's my biggest platform by far. And that was that was the the logic.
00:08:35 I don't know. It's just this just a pretty high pretty high click through rate.
00:08:41 I hope I get a big hope it makes my streams really huge hope everyone fucking watched me hope I do
00:08:47 big number on Twitch platform because a Twitch a Twitch follower, I think per capita a Twitch
00:08:56 follower is worth a lot more than a YouTube subscriber. Oh, yeah. Like just the fact that if
00:09:04 if it translates to a viewer on stream. Yeah. If you've got if you got like, yeah, yeah. It's
00:09:12 just a generally speaking, a stream has a lot less viewers total. Yeah. On average. If you've got
00:09:22 like 10k 20k followers on Twitch, like you're good, like that's your career. If you've got 20k
00:09:32 followers on YouTube, it's probably it's probably it's probably it's probably just a hobby. Yeah,
00:09:38 it's probably just a hobby and you're you're you're a and then that's where I'm at. And that's me.
00:09:44 So trying and trying to convert that one number into the other number
00:09:49 for the big for the big money. I'm trying to get that big money. Although my audience isn't big,
00:09:57 but I'm finally getting around to making avenues for people to purchase my comics. Yes, they do
00:10:05 like them. So I'm on Amazon. I don't know if you saw my tweet. I took a few pictures of
00:10:12 the Clarissa Gunsmoke proof. But you got it. You got it already. That's fast. Yeah, it's quite
00:10:17 quick. Wow. No, I didn't see that. Let me look at that. Yeah. It's, it's nice. Colors are good.
00:10:27 Print quality is, you know, good. And like, no, no problems with any of the printing.
00:10:34 It is a book. And it's real. And the only problem. The only problem is that I messed up something
00:10:43 with the bleed area, the trim. They trimmed off a bit too much off the top. All I need to do is
00:10:49 adjust the size and then re put the manuscript back in and then look at it and then publish that.
00:10:56 And then it'll be on the store and I'll have an Amazon store and you can be paying money for me.
00:11:03 I love paying money for you. Yeah. You'll have Clarissa Gunsmoke volume one,
00:11:09 the first four chapters. So that's the new chapter included. I might do like individual issues as
00:11:15 well. If you just want the fourth chapter. But like, I'm going to be doing it like the volumes
00:11:19 are cheaper than buying each chapter individually. If I do that. Whoa, screen tones. There are screen
00:11:27 tones. I have screen tones in the new chapter. Holy shit. I'm advancing my skill power, my tool set.
00:11:36 I had a somewhat similar, well, on the proof that I got of the Radcon dojin,
00:11:44 it was pretty good the bleeds, but like the page numbers were like too far off and like the page
00:11:48 numbers got cut off. So like I had to move, I'm going to move those in a little bit before I order
00:11:53 the like the reorder. Yeah. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty good. I mean, how do you feel about
00:12:00 like the paper quality and all that? The paper quality is like decent. It's not like super
00:12:07 high end stuff. It's print on demand, but it's not like, it doesn't feel like it's going to
00:12:12 fall apart. It's like good quality. It's a quality product. It's a quality product and
00:12:18 you can put it on your shelf and it won't fall apart. This is one of those books that I've heard
00:12:24 so much about. Did you have the option to like put any design on like the spine of it?
00:12:33 Yes. The cover, they say you give the manuscript, which is all the pages on the inside,
00:12:39 then they say give a separate PDF as the cover, which includes the front and the back and the
00:12:44 middle is the spine. I didn't put anything on the spine because the spine is kind of shallow.
00:12:49 Yeah. It's kind of thin for just volume one. Although I could do like a Dragon Ball thing
00:12:56 where I have the sides of the spine showing a little picture and if you line them up,
00:13:01 they'll become a little thing. I should do that. You mean like, okay, the yellow like bar on volume
00:13:07 one, I assume that extends over the spine? Yes, it does. Like if you had four. It extends over
00:13:12 the spine and it goes round to the barcode, which is printed in the bottom right corner.
00:13:16 Like if you had four, if you had four volumes of it, I don't know, I think it would look good
00:13:20 if it's just like the four different colors, but the yellow bar like continues from one
00:13:24 onto the next, like that would look good too. If you wanted to get real fancy and yeah,
00:13:28 put a little picture that forms if you put them all next to each other.
00:13:31 Or maybe I could put like a tiny number so you could see at a glance like, oh, this is volume one,
00:13:37 this is volume two, one, two, three, four. That'd be nice. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's,
00:13:43 and there's probably going to be four volumes. First volume is four chapters,
00:13:47 then it's going to be chapter five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Oh no, just three volumes. Yeah,
00:13:52 three volumes for this Closer Gunsmoke and the Bandit King adventure.
00:13:57 Oh, you have drawn five?
00:14:03 No, I've been, I've mostly been working on the Amazon stuff and my website for the past week
00:14:08 or two. Wait, I thought five was done. No, four was done. Oh, okay, okay. Oh, right, right, right,
00:14:17 right, right. Okay, four is the new one. So you can buy, by the time this episode out,
00:14:22 you can buy it. So there will be a link, an Amazon link, to buy the physical version
00:14:27 in the description. Also, I'm going to put it on, I guess I'll put it on Kindle for people who
00:14:36 use Kindle just to access that marketplace. But also, I want to make a digital version for,
00:14:47 or like on Gumroad or something so I can get more of the profit from that,
00:14:51 because Amazon takes, my cut for the Amazon is 60%. You get 60%? I get 60% of the sale.
00:15:00 That's more than I expected. Wait, how much is it? I'm going to be selling them for like
00:15:05 15 bucks, I think, volumes. That book for 15 bucks and you get 60% of that?
00:15:12 Yeah, I think so. Wow, that's, I mean, I don't know exactly how. That's cheaper than I expected
00:15:19 and that's a bigger cut than I expected. Yeah, I think that's quite reasonable. Yeah, that's not
00:15:25 bad. I thought you were going to say that due to printing and shipping fees, it was going to
00:15:32 cost like 20 plus, maybe like 20 and then you would get like maybe five bucks off a sale or
00:15:39 something. No, I mean, it's because Amazon has such a large cut of the market. They can afford to
00:15:49 make it very, very lucrative for all the independent. And I for one, celebrate them
00:15:56 for doing that because they pass that savings on to the consumer. It's so true. So true.
00:16:04 But yeah, it will be like a 60% cut for me for buying a physical version, which is much better
00:16:12 and much less labor intensive for me than if I was doing it by myself,
00:16:15 sending out books. So I'm happy with that. I think it might be the same on Kindle,
00:16:20 might not be, but I think if I put the PDF that I put on Kindle, also on Gumroad for
00:16:28 the same price, then I'll get a bigger cut. So if you just want the PDF, the digital version and
00:16:34 you don't use Kindle, like Kindle has no meaning for you, you can just get it on Gumroad and I'm
00:16:39 going to make a Gumroad and that's going to be where it's going to be.
00:16:44 Well, speaking of... I'm going to do that. I'm going to do it for Lord of Ghosts as well.
00:16:49 I'm going to do it for Redman. Redman comics are coming. Do it for him. Do it for him. Yes.
00:16:56 Maggie, Maggie Poster. Speaking of things that should be out by the time this episode goes up,
00:17:03 we got our Patreon, not Patreon money, we got our freaking Radcon money. Did you get yours?
00:17:07 Yes, I got mine. It's done. It's done. The Curse of Radcon. The Curse of Radcon is lifted.
00:17:14 The Curse of Radcon 4 is lifted, Gib. We finally did it. We finally did it. Nate actually sent.
00:17:22 Finish the OVA. We've got to release that. We dealt with a certain nefarious individuals,
00:17:32 like a non-bullshit and then all the problems were solved and then we got the money now.
00:17:43 I'm going to cry just thinking about it. It's not about the money. It's about a job well done.
00:17:51 I would say that Radcon 4 was a huge success.
00:17:54 Yes. Everyone's asking, when's Radcon 5? Everyone's asking.
00:18:01 Oh, no. We'll do a VR Radcon 5 in virtual reality. Everyone come along.
00:18:09 That would actually be pretty funny. Do like an Oculus Rift lecture with all the people jumping
00:18:15 around. Honestly, well, I mean, that could be good. That could be good. The only thing that
00:18:22 would be bad about that is that you'd be standing there for who knows how long with a
00:18:27 fucking VR headset on your head. Yes. Six-hour-long lecture about the history of
00:18:37 boats. The history of boats.
00:18:44 We scoff, but that's probably very interesting. Oh, for sure. It goes back to the beginning of
00:18:49 humanity. Yeah. I mean, you would have to, every freaking
00:18:56 culture would have their own freaking, I mean, you couldn't make a comp... You simply could
00:19:00 not make such a comprehensive history of such a thing. We came out the water. We were like,
00:19:07 what if we became mammals? But then we were sad because we couldn't be under the water
00:19:14 anymore. We invented boats to visit our old friend. The sea. Well, you see, the sea wants
00:19:23 to drag us down, but the devil fruits want us to rise up and achieve our potential. We made
00:19:27 boats so that we could go and hang out with our old buddy, but he's kind of a jerk and he wants
00:19:32 to drown us now. We made a boat so we didn't have to actually get in there. Wait, is the devil fruits
00:19:37 metaphor for evolution? Yes. We evolved to be on land and the sea was like, you're not even gonna
00:19:48 thank me. You're not even gonna say thank you. You're just gonna leave. Yep. That's why I hate
00:19:54 the devil fruits. Yep. But we should, hey, we should watch that freaking OVA this week. Oh,
00:20:05 no. I know it's gonna suck. I know it's gonna suck. I know it's gonna suck, but we should do
00:20:08 it this week and maybe we can release the, well, I'll release the bonus commentary of it.
00:20:15 Sure, sure. On Friday. Okay, okay, we'll do it. We'll do it like soon. So yeah, by the time this
00:20:20 episode goes out, this should be, the Radcon OVA should be live and we can, there'll be a bonus
00:20:29 commentary track of us watching it and cringing. Cringing hard. Yeah, yeah. But that's a scar,
00:20:39 that's a battle scar that I'll be proud to wear. The scar gained from cringing so hard.
00:20:47 Oh, because it means Radcon was done and we did it and we did everything we had to do. We did
00:20:52 everything, we did do everything we had to do. Another Twitch follower. Did I say, did I say
00:20:57 on the podcast already the thing about the video that I just, the Twitch thing? Did you talk about
00:21:02 that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Couldn't remember if that was before or after the, because cheesy's nonsense
00:21:09 derailed the start of the video. I hate that guy. That guy, but also that guy, he, I'm gonna play,
00:21:19 I'm going to play the voice of Grimace in the voiced comic version, the video comic
00:21:26 version of McPagliacci. Did you know that? Yeah, I think I saw a post on Discord about
00:21:32 McPagliacci if you want to be a voice. Yeah. I submitted voice auditions for every male character
00:21:40 and cheesy, I guess he liked my Grimace voice the best. So I'll be, I'm gonna be Grimace. It's fun.
00:21:48 Can you give us a sneak peek of that voice? What's, what's the thing he says?
00:21:55 Well, Grimace. Oh, you're singing, you're singing is good. I really like your voice,
00:22:02 Bertie. You should sing more. It's like a dark, goofy, kooky monster combo.
00:22:09 Like it evil fucked up. Oh God. How long have you been there?
00:22:14 For like five seconds. I mean, you're for five seconds.
00:22:18 Okay. Okay, boss. Sorry. I was leaking the content. No, it's fine. Actually, I'm,
00:22:26 I'm gonna actually like try to pump out the motion conic before Friday. Oh God. I can do that. Yeah.
00:22:34 Well, that's a, that's pretty, that's a pretty fast turnaround, but okay, I think I can, I think
00:22:39 I can do that for you. Appreciate it. Doesn't take, doesn't take that long.
00:22:45 Did you say you were going to send me notes? I did. Oh, you already liked it yesterday. Okay. Okay.
00:22:52 Okay. Yeah. Just read the things I actually send you, Ben. No. For once. No. Well then. No.
00:23:02 I'm gonna have to replace you. Fired, fired, fired. No.
00:23:06 Uh, you know what? Hey, stupid. My Hamburglar voice was better than Grimace.
00:23:13 My Hamburglar voice was better. You should have given me Hamburglar. I found another Hamburglar.
00:23:17 Well, well, see, that's my problem. That's my problem with you is that you did that.
00:23:27 It's fine. My Hamburglar, I'm just saying my Hamburglar voice was, was, was a masterpiece.
00:23:31 Look, you know what? We could, we could like special edition this,
00:23:35 where there's another version of the motion. This is all me. All me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:23:40 Yeah. No. Well, I'll give them, I'll give them my best shot. I'll give them my best shot. Even the
00:23:45 audience, even the audience members will just be like you, different voice, different use.
00:23:50 Yeah. I love the circus. Over and over again. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We'll workshop it. Interesting.
00:24:00 Working on it. Complete. Looking into it. Ben edition. Ben edition. Yeah, the Ben edition.
00:24:07 That'd be very cute. In case anyone who was reading the book thought like, man,
00:24:11 this would be 10 times better if everyone voiced by Ben Singh. Man, you know, they'd be
00:24:15 re, you know what would make, you know what would make this voice comic better is if it sucked.
00:24:22 That would make me McPoggliacci. Oh my God. McPoggliacci. Like Mc, like McPAWGliacci.
00:24:37 Do you know about Pogs Give? Do you know what a Pog is? Oh, I know all about that.
00:24:42 All right. You know, I, of course you do. Of course you do.
00:24:46 Um, where were we? Help. Um, we were talking about grimace.
00:24:54 Talking about, we were grimacing right then. We were, we were going to,
00:24:57 we're going to cringe and we're going to grimace when we watched the OVA.
00:25:01 Do you want to watch the uncensored version or the censored version?
00:25:07 I'm thinking censored version because I think that's the version people know.
00:25:11 Because I think the funny, some of the comedy will be, I haven't seen,
00:25:14 I have not watched as a single frame of it. I don't know anything that's in there,
00:25:18 but I think some of the comedy of it will come from like the places where Nate puts
00:25:22 like beams of light and steam clouds and stuff covering up the dirty parts.
00:25:29 Did I mention that? Did you guys actually show dirty parts in it?
00:25:33 Well, they, well, you know, they're, well, yeah, because we were all females at the time.
00:25:42 So all of our nipples became female presenting. So our nipples are not safe for work in that video
00:25:51 at the time. They're fine now. And to this day.
00:25:56 Well, my nipples became recently female. My nipples recently became female
00:26:00 resenting, if you will.
00:26:03 Okay, that's not what I thought you were going with that.
00:26:08 Like a repelling force.
00:26:09 Yeah, yeah, like a female looks at it and they're like, never, never mind. No, thank you.
00:26:19 Nice.
00:26:20 I have a, I have a complaint. Wait, okay. I got one more thing.
00:26:26 Uh, the plebeian wee blue rays. I'm going to run out. They're going to be gone soon.
00:26:31 And I'm, and here's the thing. It's not, it's not worth making more of them.
00:26:36 It's not, it's not worth it. So I'm not going to, I'm not going to make more of them.
00:26:40 You know, a lot of people have gotten angry at me about that lately. I've gained some haters over
00:26:46 it. You want to know how many I've sold in this, in this recent bout with me writing the manifesto
00:26:52 and all that three, four, four. Oh, it's up to four now. So all of, all of this, uh, all this,
00:27:00 this nonsense, all this, all these shenanigans have been for the sake of selling four copies
00:27:06 of these. And I have, oh, I have four more. I have four left on my shelf. So, um, yeah,
00:27:13 pretty sure when those are gone, uh, that's going to be it. Cause it's, you know, it's not,
00:27:18 it's just not worth it. It's just not worth the trouble.
00:27:23 You know what this means? What's that?
00:27:26 Write a second manifesto and you'll sell four more.
00:27:29 No, no. I think one, I think one sold because I wrote the manifesto. Did I mention the manifesto?
00:27:35 I just, if I,
00:27:36 I don't think you mentioned it. I saw it though.
00:27:38 On the podcast. Yeah, I didn't mention it on the podcast. I think I sent it on the stream.
00:27:42 Yeah, I wrote, I wrote, I wrote a thing on my website called the Blu-ray manifesto,
00:27:46 stcomics.com slash brm.html. And it's just, and it's just
00:27:53 an explanation of my reasoning behind why I think writing the Blu-rays was good
00:27:59 and the right thing to do. And you don't have to agree with it, but I wrote it
00:28:03 because I didn't want to explain it to anyone else. It's like, that's, that's my reason. And if
00:28:10 you don't agree, then I guess we don't agree. But the statement is there. And I think, I just
00:28:16 thought, I think it's really funny. I asked, you know who, I got to say, I got to tell Cody
00:28:22 LaRue, the butt chugger himself. I got to ask, he was mad at me and I asked him, did you read my
00:28:28 manifesto? And he said, I will after work. And I said, nothing.
00:28:34 I should have named the manifesto the Blu-ray question.
00:28:39 The Blu-ray question. That would have been good. I just, I just, I like calling it a manifesto.
00:28:45 Anyway, I'm, yeah, they're gonna, they're, they're going. Listen guys, I just, if you want one,
00:28:51 get one now. I have four left and I'm not gonna restock because I can't justify the cost of it.
00:28:57 So, you know, buy the, buy them while they're still there. Twitchsaintcomics.com
00:29:02 slash store.html. Or, or else, or you'll live or live in regret. Okay.
00:29:12 And if you, if you're not interested in buying that, actually don't buy the Blu-ray. Save your
00:29:17 money for me, for me, actually. And pre-order, make Pagalacchi right now. We have two days left.
00:29:23 I bought it. I bought a copy.
00:29:25 Yeah, yeah. Ben here bought a copy. I even follow, follow your leader,
00:29:29 PCP listeners and buy a copy of McPagalacchi. I mean, if there's one, if there's one McPagalacchi
00:29:38 fan, it's me. And if there's no McPagalacchi fans, I'm dead. I'm, I'm, I'm McPagalacchi
00:29:46 for life. I'm right or die. Yeah. Yeah. Ben auditioned for the Birdie Boys.
00:29:51 No, he did not. I told them. That's like the only, that's like the only voice in the comic that I
00:29:55 did not audition for. You don't need to lie. Maybe, maybe take a couple more years of, of HRT
00:30:03 Ben and maybe we'll get back to the Birdie, the Birdie voice. Maybe we'll have a discussion
00:30:07 about it. You know, I watched, I watched a bunch of McDonaldland commercials to, to like get a sense
00:30:12 of what the voices were like. And I didn't hear, none of them had Birdie in them. I didn't hear
00:30:16 Birdie even a single time. I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't classic silencing women. I mean, I wasn't
00:30:21 looking for, I think she was introduced yet you weren't looking for, I was looking, I was looking
00:30:26 for Grimace and Hamburglar and, and Ronald. What, there you go. Did you type in? But I, but I mean,
00:30:33 I saw other, like I saw Mayor McCheese, I heard Mayor McCheese speak many more times than I
00:30:39 heard Birdie, which was zero. Probably, you probably saw a couple commercials from like
00:30:44 the 70s to like early 80s. Did they introduce Birdie later? Yeah, she was kind of later.
00:30:51 She's kind of like the, the last like mainstay character. Okay. Yeah, that, that is probably
00:30:56 why then I was looking at the really old ones. Is she the Smurfette? They were like, we need a woman.
00:31:02 We need representation. They needed a mascot to represent the breakfast menu. Oh, oh, oh, she's
00:31:09 the early Birdie. Oh, I, that's her full name. I never knew that. First name, early. Last name,
00:31:19 Birdie. That crazy. That changes everything. Yeah, yeah. So wait, what, what are the rest of them?
00:31:28 What's Grimace? Grimace is milkshakes, right? Wasn't he like a milkshake stealing monster?
00:31:34 Yeah, Grimace was the original, originally a milkshake monster.
00:31:38 Makes sense because of how thick he is. Yeah. Didn't they talk about this in like the newest
00:31:42 red letter media? One of them brings up Grimace and so and one and one of them is like, yeah,
00:31:47 there's a whole backstory behind Grimace, but I don't remember it. And they're all like, yeah,
00:31:50 none of us remember it, but there definitely is one. Oh, anyway, let's talk about how Mike hates
00:31:56 old people. The Grimace backstory has been like retcon like two times. I didn't, because they were
00:32:03 talking about it, I looked it up and I guess he was originally like a villain. He was like,
00:32:07 he's like a reformed villain. He's like discord. He's like Vegeta. He's exactly like Vegeta.
00:32:14 Grimace is the Vegeta of the Ronald McDonald universe. He popped up and showed to be,
00:32:20 showed to be too powerful for Ronald to handle, but over over a course of time.
00:32:26 Like he became friendly. Like he originally had four arms. He had four arms for stealing milkshakes
00:32:31 and they just got rid of, they just forgot it. Oh, he's a milkshake stealer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:32:38 Yeah. So the hamburger is like a hamburger. Yep. The burger. And the fry guys steal fries.
00:32:44 Yeah. Why is everyone trying to steal all this food? It's an entire universe of tricks rabbits.
00:32:51 Okay. So basically in McDonald land, food is very like just plentiful. Actually,
00:32:58 food is just straight up alive in McDonald land, right? Literally grows on trees.
00:33:05 I guess it's implied that like Grimace, Hamburger, all the characters are not
00:33:12 necessarily like natives to McDonald land, not even like Ronald potentially.
00:33:18 So this is an invasive force. Colonizers. They're colonizing the nugget plan. I actually have my
00:33:25 own like head cannon of how all this like works. Let's get into it. Okay. So basically, how does
00:33:32 this relate to the clown force? So, oh man, we'll be here all day. Is this a potential lecture?
00:33:41 Oh, you're right. You know, honestly, McDonald land lore, but there probably is an hour's worth
00:33:46 of lore there. Probably. It'll be kind of tough because I really have to like,
00:33:54 I've seen the majority of the commercials. I swear I've seen the majority of them.
00:33:58 But every couple of months, like a new one that I haven't seen pops up. It's almost like they
00:34:02 manifest into the ether, right? Even like yesterday, I was like, I was talking to a bud, another of the
00:34:11 voice actors and I asked him, hey, do you think you could do just a quick like Mayor McCheese line?
00:34:17 Because he literally just has one line in McPugly Archie. And he's like, yeah, sure. How does
00:34:21 Mayor McCheese sound? And I'm like, oh, he's literally just like the Mad Hatter impression from
00:34:26 the. Yeah, like, like, I'm not a cheeseburger, don't you know? He says shit like that. And
00:34:34 and so I looked up a clip of myself in a McDonald land commercial Mayor McCheese. And the first
00:34:41 one that I saw was like, wait, I've never seen this commercial. Because it's literally like,
00:34:46 it's a commercial from the 70s. And he's like, weird aliens, aliens that look kind of like
00:34:51 crewmates from a mugga's that may make cheese because they think he's an actual cheeseburger.
00:34:56 Well, they think he's like an edible cheeseburger. Does he just does he just have like a congenital
00:35:01 illness that makes him look like a cheeseburger, but he's not actually a cheeseburger? Well, my
00:35:05 theory is that the thing is that you never necessarily see one of the good cheeseburgers
00:35:13 eat. Yeah, you never see any of the characters like eat any of the food, to be honest. And I think
00:35:20 I think what it is in McDonald land is that the food is just kind of sent to it, like it's just
00:35:25 alive. And in the commercials, sometimes there's like, there's like just a hamburger with eyes
00:35:31 with no body, right? What I like to think is that the older they get, they grow a body like
00:35:36 may or make cheese. And the like the ones with like just with just like that hamburger and two
00:35:42 eyeballs is like the young form and they and it kind of grow on like bushes and trees, apparently,
00:35:47 because you see like, you never see anyone make the stuff, it just kind of grows like it manifests
00:35:52 the Garden of Eden. Yeah, and there was even like, there was this one tree character that was kind
00:35:58 of like one of the main cast, but that never necessarily like brought back. And he's like
00:36:02 mentioned, he's like brought up in one of the cartoons, but never like, again, I notice.
00:36:09 My theory is that like Ronald, and this is from this is my like on this is like what I think is
00:36:16 the main kind of like line of continuity from, since like the early commercials up until like
00:36:22 the few handfuls that were made in the early 2000s is that Ronald has this kind of like aura
00:36:29 that like man, that like kind of brings out the kids and people, you know, kind of like comforting
00:36:35 aura, right? But but if you say he's like a paladin, he's like a paladin, like a heroic aura of
00:36:41 courage that nullifies fear effects to all his party members. Yeah, he's a holy warrior.
00:36:48 He makes you feel he makes you feel young, you know, in an innocent sort of way. But what I
00:36:54 like to think happens is that if you stand around him for too long, or if you hang out with him for
00:36:58 too long, you start like not just feeling like a kid, but you start de-aging. You start becoming
00:37:06 younger. That would be terrible. And my main my main theory to kind of the main kind of point
00:37:13 that I like to think is evidence of this is the fact that when the hamburger first showed up,
00:37:17 he was kind of like he had white hair. Yeah, like he kind of had wrinkly skin.
00:37:23 In his first appearance on now, he's like young. He has like red hair. He's like ginger now. Yeah,
00:37:28 he got younger. Surely it could it could just be the the air of the hamburger line lineage.
00:37:35 Surely surely it could be his little offspring. True. True. That being said, I like to think
00:37:42 that that's kind of the reason why maybe that's why the food in like McDonald's land doesn't like
00:37:48 rot away because they're just around Ronald that keeps them like weirdly fresh. You know,
00:37:54 it keeps them like young, in a sense. Right. He's a freshness clown. And if you haven't noticed.
00:38:00 Freshness. He's the power of freshness. He ate the fresh. He ate the fresh. Yeah, that's a yep.
00:38:08 And another another piece to the puzzle is the fact that when Grimace first appeared,
00:38:13 he had forward arms and now he just has two, right? And what I like to think is that Grimace
00:38:18 a species grows an extra set of arms the older they get. And well, Ronald is like turning Grimace
00:38:25 younger. Actually Grimace seems to get dumber, right? But maybe he's not that he's getting
00:38:29 dumber. He's just getting like that child like naivety, you know, his brain is is yeah, de de
00:38:37 forming. Right. It was early birdie going to turn into an egg. No, early birdie. Well, there's
00:38:45 there's there's a commercial where it's like when she first shows when like they they give her an
00:38:50 origin story, right? Like she was like an egg they found and she hatched and she was already she
00:38:55 hatched with clothes on and everything. But like her you stay as a kid, you don't like become a baby
00:39:01 or fetish, you just stay as a kid, you know, like you stay the target audience for a character like
00:39:05 Ronald, right? That that being said, I think Ronald probably realizes that he has his effect on people
00:39:11 and it's kind of like a horrifying when it happens. And I think other adult characters in the early
00:39:18 commercials kind of realized this. That's why they disappeared because they realized we can't be around
00:39:22 Ronald because we're going to river back into being a kid. That's why the professor, then there are
00:39:27 no more. That's why Captain Crook is in there no more. Mayor McCheese as well. They were just like
00:39:34 we've got business to take care of. We can't be we can't be messing around with this shit. I see.
00:39:40 Right, exactly. 30 characters kind of stayed around. It's also the fry kids. They were originally
00:39:46 known as the fry goblins, right? They learned that. And the thing is, there used to be like way
00:39:54 more of them. There used to be a lot of them because they seem to be addicted to fries, right?
00:39:58 They wanted to constantly eat them. I think what probably happened is that the fry goblins probably
00:40:04 realized the this weird side effect of hanging out around Ronald caused to them, right? So like
00:40:11 slowly they stopped like trying to be around Ronald, trying to eat fries and only like a concentrated
00:40:17 few stick around. And it didn't make sense calling them by their species name and only made sense
00:40:22 calling them by specifically what they are. They became the fry kids. They became younger.
00:40:26 Oh my god. There is. That's amazing. And a little bit back to Grimace, I'd like to think that
00:40:34 Ronald realized that he can't like he kind of had to there's this commercial that kind of red
00:40:41 cons the origin of Grimace. And it implies like Ronald said, because Grimace doesn't remember,
00:40:46 but Ronald says, oh, we used to be like literally kids that hanged out and we're usually we were
00:40:52 actually babies together that grew up, right? And Grimace just kind of buys it. But how is how
00:40:57 is it just Ronald like convincing them that, hey, this is actually implanted false memories.
00:41:03 Yeah, exactly that. Hey, you weren't an adult. And you were never an adult. Actually,
00:41:08 you're still a kid this whole time, blah, blah, blah stuff, you know,
00:41:12 you got Mac gaslit. Yeah, Mac gaslit. You got make light to what if okay, alternate theory.
00:41:19 Okay, here's my here's my alternate theory is that the McDonald Land commercials actually,
00:41:25 they just take place in reverse in reverse chronological order.
00:41:29 You think so? I don't know. I mean, wouldn't that wouldn't that explain all this all the same things?
00:41:34 I mean, what if they're just they're just they're just showing them in reverse?
00:41:39 You'd have to track the existence of things. The thing is that like, they kind of like,
00:41:45 I mean, the commercials usually end with like a current toy of that era, mostly the ones like,
00:41:51 as we get into like that. But you see, it's an it's an alternate time stream,
00:41:56 whose whose time flows in the opposite direction of our own.
00:42:00 Well, you see, like, if we become more into the 70s, like black people start losing rights,
00:42:06 women start losing rights, holy shit, you're right. Actually, in their in their
00:42:13 as their time goes forward, our time goes backwards. So, so, you know, our future is
00:42:18 their past. They're they're they're the two the two timelines point in different directions,
00:42:22 but they're parallel to each other. I'm gonna leave a little more evidence for this one.
00:42:26 I just I just think that wouldn't that also explain that like, oh, as the commercials
00:42:31 went on, everyone looks younger and like grimace. What if what if what if Ronald that would explain
00:42:37 Ronald would be telling the truth, they did grow up as kids, but then in the in their future
00:42:42 of the timeline that aired in the 70s, grimace grows up to be an evil milkshake stealing.
00:42:48 Beast, I don't know, because it's like, there's this kind of like when the characters are first
00:42:54 introduced, I mean, I guess it's implied there's some sort of like, I mean, I just I mean, I just
00:42:58 think you're reverse age. I just think you're reverse aging aura theory is so ridiculous. I
00:43:02 just think it makes a lot more sense that like clearly the time stream has just been reversed
00:43:06 and is flowing in reverse parallel to our own. I mean, you'd need to show it's just so much more
00:43:12 plausible each other more in the past than they do in the present. I think there's more evidence
00:43:17 for my they get younger. They become younger around Ronald theory. I think there's more evidence
00:43:22 to that. What happened? What happened with because obviously they retired Ronald McDonald
00:43:30 from like this the main look of a lot of McDonald's stores. I don't know if that still exists. I don't
00:43:36 know if they like still have kiddie. They mostly just they mostly just use Ronald for the was it
00:43:41 the McDonald house and just like a charity. There's one in my city and that's where I like
00:43:47 take the pictures with the Ronald statue because it's right in front of their building.
00:43:53 They mostly see Ronald here and there. He's on Instagram. He has like a social media account.
00:44:00 That's really funny. His look kind of changed and mostly just keep them for like I notice he
00:44:05 mostly does like little parade or events. Yeah. Yeah. And charities they don't do like commercials
00:44:10 with him no more. And it's a combination of like they'll bring it back eventually.
00:44:16 I think it I think it ultimately I think it does have to do something with the documentary
00:44:21 supersize me because I like change the shit load of things for McDonald's like that documentary
00:44:27 was bullshit too. Oh yeah but that was like like years later we kind of well I don't even know if
00:44:34 it's like public like everything I feel like it's because I always hear like oh the documentary is
00:44:40 bullshit all the time yada yada. How do we not know this is just because of our little
00:44:44 circles that we carve ourselves and everyone is aware of that but like to ignore me how aware
00:44:49 are they that like that commercial is bullshit because like yeah you know on a surface level
00:44:54 it's like oh yeah you know you too much for McDonald's this is bad for you yeah obviously right but
00:44:58 maybe the problem is that like oh how bad it is was kind of like misdirected in that commercial
00:45:06 in that documentary. I mean that documentary made like a huge cultural impact so and so and
00:45:12 everybody knows about supersize me so yeah it's going to be it's going to be fewer people that
00:45:17 hear about oh did you hear was kind of debunked like oh did you hear that guy was kind of like
00:45:21 lying about it like oh did you hear that like there was all this weird shit going on behind the
00:45:25 scenes and like he misattributed lots of things and he was like also an alcoholic at the time and
00:45:31 it's etc etc. Yeah I remember when the first like the first couple of times make the news in the
00:45:37 same way. Yeah I remember the first couple of times I heard it get debunked um people's first
00:45:42 reaction were like oh are you paid out by McDonald's lol yeah right what are you in the pot you're in
00:45:47 the pocket of big cheese. Big M. Big M. Big clown. Yeah big clown. Right. Right. I mean I don't
00:45:57 want to I don't want to I don't want to keep for McDonald's or anything but you know yeah it's like
00:46:03 the what he what he did it what it was the purpose the purpose for the documentary was to make
00:46:08 people realized that first food was bad and very bad if you ate it all the time which is true
00:46:16 it's just that like so like is it really that much of a negative outcome it's true but it's just
00:46:22 that the it was it was made in a way that is like the food at McDonald's will do this to you but
00:46:27 like he did it in an extremely unscientific way and he did it in a way that was like specifically
00:46:33 designed to guarantee like a bad outcome and it he also like never he also never like said that he
00:46:40 was actually going through alcohol like he was an alcoholic which is like an important thing when
00:46:45 you're talking about like the the effect that like the food you're eating has on your body
00:46:50 it's like that that might have had the could that have had an impact you never who knows he
00:46:54 fucked up his liver his liver got fucked by the introduction I wonder if that does anything
00:46:59 metabolism or like alcohol or it might have just been the alcohol that did it for you because they
00:47:05 interviewed a guy in the documentary said like oh I eat it every day and what's funny is that guy
00:47:09 looks kind of like fucking John Lennon yeah um and I'm thinking like well if it makes you look like
00:47:14 John Lennon it can't be that bad right it's you know feed it every day that you therefore it makes
00:47:20 you grow those glasses wait what was that I think I watched it at at the digi house uh with Trixie
00:47:25 and maybe Victor there no no not supersize me but like the response to it you know what I mean
00:47:30 there was like oh there was yeah there was like it was it called baloney or something there was a
00:47:35 counter there was a counter I watched it I watched the counter documentary and it was like yeah the
00:47:40 guy eats mcdonald's every day but like he loses weight because he also starts like exercising
00:47:45 and stuff that had a it had a really cringy like animated segment in the middle with like
00:47:51 yeah really like uncomfortable like stupid libertarian like moralizing
00:47:58 yeah that part's bad but like the point he's making is good it's like you know it's not
00:48:04 yeah you actually well if you wanted to you actually could eat mcdonald's every day and
00:48:08 still like lose weight and stay healthy you could eat mcdonald's I think I think it's just a bad habit
00:48:15 for children yeah no yeah yeah that's that's kind of like one every day that's kind of what
00:48:21 it took like ronald I mean they kind of already knew that even back in the day too because they
00:48:26 you'd never like there probably is like one or two commercials where you see ronald's eating
00:48:31 like mcdonald's food but like the majority of them he's never eating it they kind of just he's
00:48:36 just kind of sitting in front of it and he's never put it in his fucking mouth but yeah you never
00:48:41 see him like eating any of it yeah he never eats it he's he's a total I mean it's probably just
00:48:46 because he hates it it's not it's not you know this is alive yeah but I was it's probably just
00:48:50 because like it's not a very flattering like look for a person and also he would get his clown
00:48:55 makeup all over the food and it would probably just be messy and like he's already got red like
00:49:01 ketchup or there's a way to eat there's a way to eat with clown makeup on I done it before yeah I
00:49:07 mean I'm sure they could wait to eat out pussy that's disgusting clowns they don't have that on the
00:49:15 menu no they don't they don't have mine at my McDonald's they will we're doing a massive rebrand
00:49:26 pcp is now going to be a fast food chain I'm thinking about um I'm thinking about uh trying to get
00:49:33 a job at McDonald's for like a month and I just put copies of McPuglachy and people's bags
00:49:38 oh that would be so funny they get dude that would be they get home they're like what the fuck is
00:49:43 this that would actually be like really funny how would you how would you stealth it you'd have to
00:49:50 you'd be behind the counter or something okay I have to like it has to be drive through yeah and
00:49:55 like the thing is I'd have to like grease all over the copies that's true but luckily it's like
00:50:01 just it because it's just I had the test copy that I got it's just like yellowish printer paper
00:50:09 but uh that that being said I have to like um hide a stacked somewhere near the counter and
00:50:14 and you could probably hide it well enough that people just think it's like oh this just looks
00:50:17 like paper like it's just paper that's on the left there and it might be important yeah it'll
00:50:20 touch it right and then I just casually just put it I mean I can even pretend what would you do
00:50:25 kind of like oh do you want some sauce and then like you know get one and put the sauce in it and
00:50:30 then put it in the bag what's the conversation like when you're you're working at mcdonald's
00:50:33 in like two weeks into your you're working at mcdonald's your boss is like cheesy I need to see
00:50:37 you in my office what are these and he really is on a stack of mcpogliacci it's like where did you
00:50:43 get I don't know I don't know I they were there when I when I started I thought those were napkins
00:50:53 I thought those were napkins the paper doesn't seem like it's kind of like flimsy it doesn't
00:50:59 seem like such a what a piece of shit I can't believe they're in $15
00:51:07 I say like look it's yellow like the burger wrapper I thought you guys made it
00:51:12 he could wrap the burgers in the mcpogliacci or you know what would be funny I'd be like oh
00:51:16 fucking um fucking the man the was it the vice manager whatever the fuck they're called the
00:51:22 assistant manager like he I saw him just grab that and put a sauce in it and put it in the bag so
00:51:27 I thought oh that's what you're supposed to do and I just kept doing it um yeah I don't know who's
00:51:32 restocking it I mean I guess I think you brought them here's the dead giveaway
00:51:40 you just gotta go buy a pseudonym when you apply for the job that's true or I gotta print out a
00:51:45 special batch that just has to name cheesy man I mean they could just look up cheesy and find my
00:51:49 name it's not that hard oh man well that's a plan um it has to be I'm I'm imagining you're wearing
00:51:55 the clown makeup the whole time that would be such a weird like stealth market that would require
00:52:00 like a really incredible commitment to the bit which I would respect immensely it would it would and
00:52:08 I don't know if I got that it's a lot it's quite it's a lot to do you gotta have you gotta be like
00:52:15 you you know you're at the drive through the hand over the thing and then you ninja star throw like
00:52:20 like the the book in behind them so they can't see it and it's in the back of their car
00:52:25 um yeah true it's um it's something um I mean you know I'm kind of hoping that this is this is
00:52:36 my kind of what I'm hoping in my brain because I'm hoping that I by by the time this podcast
00:52:43 get out the motion comic should be available for people to like watch and I'm hoping that I see enough
00:52:50 yeah yeah yeah but I could do it I mean I already got everything in place I guess I better hurry and
00:52:56 record those lines then yeah please I appreciate it but um what I was saying is that um I hope I mean
00:53:06 either if it's out like by now or even I wanted to be up before the deadline because I'm hoping
00:53:14 that enough attention could be brought to it that like it makes it worthwhile to extend the deadline
00:53:20 a little bit more you know because like oh now a new group of people are finding out about
00:53:25 McPuglatchy because of the motion comic you know right it's it's it's it's kind of it's it's a gamble
00:53:33 but I think I think overall like over time you are gonna like talk about hey do you know about
00:53:38 this comic yada yada yada you know I mean yeah I know what I'm saying that's I think so I think
00:53:46 that's plausible I mean it's a really it's just a really funny idea I've heard something that could
00:53:51 exist so I think I think yeah I think you've uh if I could go slight yeah that's it if I could go
00:54:02 like slightly back in time I probably would have done the motion comic before doing pre-orders but
00:54:06 um kind of like spurred on them I mean it's not like you have to stop taking orders after the
00:54:13 comic right you can still take orders right yeah yeah I could if people like um I mean
00:54:20 because they send me it in bulk when they um when they say you have to like order a certain amount
00:54:26 so I know I know like I'm probably not going to get to that number but like I am going to have
00:54:31 so and like you know I have physical conventions I'm planning to take the book too so you know
00:54:36 people can get it in person if they see me um I'm doing another convention next month
00:54:42 too and I'm actually doing a panel for the first time oh doing a dynamic panel what do you mean
00:54:50 what's the what's the panel it's uh it's oh the panel is um actually there's a there's a page for it
00:54:57 but I think I think I gave it the name uh how to design a villain is the name of the panel
00:55:02 hmm and it's uh it's basically um it starts off as kind of a very like I give you like the
00:55:12 abridge basic um tips for designing a character and then we then we jump into talking about
00:55:17 designing villains and then I talk about like here's my mentality when I came to designing these four
00:55:24 villain versus characters and then the second half of the panel is kind of like a audience member
00:55:31 like they give suggestions for what to design and I create a character right in front of their eyes
00:55:37 like a magician yeah exactly and I'm doing that at uh the convention is called uh Fangia
00:55:47 it's here in San Diego and it's pretty it's pretty cool I was uh boofing there last year it's not too
00:55:53 bad um what was kind of annoying last year was that the one of the halls where they have the
00:55:59 vendors also doubles as like a hall with a stage and sometimes they're bringing people to play like
00:56:05 the loud ass music like live performances but the thing is like you're trying to sell so imagine if
00:56:11 you hear a fucking like Japanese drums in the same room as you're trying to like tell people like oh
00:56:16 this is what my comic's about but they can't hear you that's like that was like one of my complaints
00:56:21 about the event um also there was a guy there like cosplaying as christian which I didn't like
00:56:27 kind of was really bothered by that um luckily there was other people there who were too who
00:56:32 were also bothered by them and they approached this guy and told him like hey wait a guy doing
00:56:36 what you're doing say that again a cosplay yeah yeah he like he came well yeah he came in with
00:56:42 the striped sweater and he had like a sonic chip okay yeah and I was I was like what are you doing
00:56:52 there bud what do you think you're doing well I mean what's the problem was he bothering people
00:56:58 it's just I in my opinion it's like a hot take I think it's very inappropriate that I did that
00:57:05 I'll say that because I don't I think I've said this is publicly before I really don't like
00:57:13 like anyone who's really into like yeah into the I mean I guess I get that because I
00:57:22 I I'd see it like at the end of the day I see it as like this was like a massive like
00:57:28 like kind of like a well not kind I think it was like a cyberbullying campaign on like
00:57:34 basically a disabled person online and I think um I think like when you cosplayed it when you do
00:57:40 like the fan art when people like sell the christian shirt merch and stuff like that it's this weird
00:57:46 kind of like glossing over the fact this was kind of actually very terrible that's just happened to
00:57:50 this person and I know I know people like to say like oh well he turned out to I mean she turned
00:57:55 out to do this terrible shit sure but that was like very much at the tail end of the whole thing
00:58:01 the majority of it was her getting goaded to do awful like things it it was like ultimately like
00:58:08 bullying and I'm hoping that I'm hoping with that when we eventually get the Netflix documentary
00:58:14 about this um they go with that handle because it's like you're kind of right but don't you think
00:58:21 but don't you think it's going a little bit far to be like this guy's wearing a costume I don't
00:58:25 wear I'm gonna I'm gonna like make an issue of it and complain about it I don't know there was like
00:58:32 someone wearing a costume I I somebody it's them just like this guy's wearing a costume with
00:58:38 disabled person that the whole joke is like hey remember this like disabled person like they
00:58:43 got bullied online well I'm gonna dress up as that person and I I think I would I think I would
00:58:48 understand if it was like something like years ago like it was Henry Darker had like a look
00:58:53 okay I don't I don't know if it was you I mean the person's still alive I guess
00:59:00 a lot of it was like a recent memory sure I guess uh whatever I I know the the internet
00:59:07 makes things seem like they happen a while long ago because things happen so fast but
00:59:12 like I think the main thing is you you get a bit of a sense of the type of person who would choose
00:59:17 that as a cosplay and then you're I mean that's probably yeah I I don't I don't mind their costume
00:59:22 I guess I wouldn't like report them like I don't like I don't like most bad first impression
00:59:28 that's that's that's true I I I think there's like I think there's something kind of wrong with
00:59:35 people who like obsess over it I mean there's there's there's a there's a I know and I I'm
00:59:41 talking to Ben I'm talking to I know I'm talking to Ben who made like two videos about it yeah it's
00:59:45 fine I I know because of that I've had I've had I've had so many I've had so many interactions
00:59:51 with so many interactions with people online who are like so bad about it like I know the type of
00:59:56 person you're talking about I just wouldn't assume it I mean honestly yeah if I got it would I just
01:00:03 wouldn't assume it based on the solely on the fact that someone's interested in Chris or thinks Chris
01:00:08 is funny or even wore a costume of it but like yeah there's a definite type of person who's like
01:00:13 too into it and is weird about it and is probably a Kiwi farmer and probably doesn't think trans
01:00:21 people are real most of the time if you if you if you ask them etc etc but also live free or die
01:00:29 but also but also I'll never take away his right to say it I'll die for your right for your right
01:00:39 to wear that striped shirt in public sir okay well I the only thing I'll die for I don't like it
01:00:50 I don't like it I'm not a fan I think it's um I think it's awful well I think you're awful that's
01:00:58 okay well all right okay okay that guy who who made that twitter comic you made
01:01:05 that aren't you twitter how dare you criticize someone else for something when you did something
01:01:12 that I don't like you hypocrite you made big twitter artists and that was bad
01:01:22 you know it's so funny like answer the question that was bad
01:01:29 cheesy was it bad or not for you doing that just say yes no in fact just say yes no I just say yes
01:01:35 admit it admit it admit you did admit you did you did something or die okay what are you saying
01:01:42 um deep fake deep fake me on like uh passion of the Christ uh scene where he's getting
01:01:48 crucified but it's me and I'm like um I regret big twitter artists oh no what I was gonna say
01:01:57 earlier is that I keep hearing like people tell me about like um they tell me about other
01:02:03 bigger artists like just DMing other art bigger artists and be like hey just retweet this for me
01:02:08 and they just kind of do it and it's like they're they're not friends or anything they're just mutuals
01:02:14 and it just kind of happens like all the time casually and I'm gonna hear everything and like
01:02:19 well they're doing it they've been doing it yeah the problem the problem is that like you're not
01:02:24 big enough for them to give a shit about yeah um it's it's uh it's it's annoying it's a yeah it's
01:02:32 it's annoying um I don't consider like mutuals friends I think I only consider someone a friend
01:02:38 if I like talk to them in a voice call at least like uh 200 I keep count
01:02:47 no but I can send this so I can guess it I consider a mutual a friend when I leave a reply
01:02:52 and then they like their play I consider my friend is one mutual a friend when we meet up and and
01:02:58 fuck I consider my friend once he starts sending me salacious photos that's that's the line that's
01:03:05 when that's the confirmation like okay this person's in it he's he's part of the cheesy the the
01:03:12 cheesy on you know what the cheesy family you know what's weird you know maybe you you know what
01:03:17 I'm like I'm like I'm like not a nudes guy I like don't like nudes yeah really you prefer
01:03:24 talking over personalities and talking I would hate it if nudes no uh I just don't no no no
01:03:31 what I I don't when I'm uh talking to someone I'm not I'm not angling for nudes I kind of don't
01:03:40 care to see the picture I you know if I if I if I think they're attractive and I want to have sex
01:03:45 with them I would want to meet them in person and maybe we fuck and that's cool I I don't know I
01:03:52 don't need I don't need them to send me pictures of their body like I'll see it you know what I mean
01:04:00 like you don't like you're kind of like I don't look up what cars they have at the dealership I
01:04:05 just show up to the dealership yeah see what they got yeah I guess so yeah sure I mean I'm not a car
01:04:14 guy so I wouldn't make that comparison but sure close yeah of course I don't like nudes and I don't
01:04:21 like cars and I don't like oh my god I'm a woman I was a woman all along nude cars if I I don't
01:04:29 like guy things if a smoke show if a real if a real if a real hot babe DM view and saying oh Ben
01:04:36 oh let me show you this picture of my pussy what would you say like no no one's no one's say no
01:04:41 thank you your personality no be fine no be fine I'm just I just I don't I don't I probably wouldn't
01:04:47 I probably wouldn't ask for nudes even if even if I thought I could get them I would just be like
01:04:53 let's find you earn them let's meet let's meet and fuck baby let's let's but babe just show
01:05:03 show me a picture of your personality that's the real that's what I'm really sure I mean I'd like
01:05:07 to see a picture of your diet I'd like to see what she looks like and I'm like and then and then
01:05:12 from that I can be like do I like this okay good and I don't need I don't need to see the nude
01:05:18 to know if I'm interested I don't need to see the nude to know if I'm interested or not
01:05:22 but that's but that's not it is that that's how what nudes is about it's not about like
01:05:26 determining am I interested or not right it's usually like if you're getting nudes you're
01:05:30 already interested yes it's it's so if the so if the interest is there social interaction I don't
01:05:35 really need the nude let's just get together I think um now and now there's this now now woman
01:05:46 who's in Ben Sainz yeah I'm talking about yeah I hope god god I hope she's listening god I hope
01:05:59 you know I think there's this kind of like thing you hear all the time where like
01:06:02 um people are like oh why does anyone pay for only fans when there's like just titties free
01:06:07 online you know and it's kind of like well you're missing the point of it because it's not even like
01:06:12 necessarily about seeing titties just for titties sake but like um there's this kind of like um
01:06:19 almost like a a bond that you're paying for you know because a lot of like people who do kind of
01:06:25 only fans and it's not even necessarily like an only fans thing there's something like kind of
01:06:30 social interaction that you get from someone sending their own picture of their own titty to you
01:06:37 instead of you finding like a random there's a little bit more of a connection there yeah it's
01:06:41 like it's like yeah obviously it's paid for but you know it's part of it you know an incredibly
01:06:47 cringe way to look at listen I'm not I'm not trying to be a snob about it because I am on only fans
01:06:53 and I have I'll say at least one subscription but it's not but it's not a wait type type it into
01:07:00 the general no you don't gotta tell us just no it doesn't matter I'm gonna throw out some names
01:07:06 that you're gonna just just like wink look uh twice if I right I think I might have mentioned some on
01:07:11 the on the on a bonus episode one time but it doesn't matter but the point is it's not is definitely
01:07:16 not about oh I feel a social connection I feel some sort of some sort of a social interaction
01:07:22 with this person it is not about that is it is about it is about I want to get that I I like this
01:07:28 person I like their look I want to see a person that looks like this doing that they've got this
01:07:35 paywall content and I'm prepared to pay for it right I guess right it's not it's I mean I guess
01:07:42 it is a parasocial thing in the sense that like every like online interaction is parasocial but
01:07:46 it's not like oh I feel close to them I yeah I because they specifically sent me their news
01:07:52 because I made the request and they gave it to me no I made the request because I wanted to see
01:07:56 it I don't give a shit and they gave it to you sending a thing for it right right it's not it's
01:08:01 not about it's not about that so I don't agree with me Ben tell me Ben you're never taken advantage
01:08:07 of when they say like hey guys uh doing uh dick raid offers send your dick for the DMs you never
01:08:13 took an advantage of those deals I don't take advantage of women cheesy I don't take advantage
01:08:21 of women or deals because I believe in consent and consent and deals violate the non-aggression
01:08:26 principle I believe deals go against free market I believe deals are against and I trust the market
01:08:33 I believe deals are against God's law if you read the Torah it says uh it says uh don't eat don't
01:08:40 eat anything that's verboten uh uh no usury and it should have had a third clause it should have
01:08:47 also outlawed deals but they forgot God just God just forgot I am scrolling through the people
01:08:53 that you follow and see if any name pops up you don't I really want a pinpoint what on what on
01:08:59 twitter yeah on twitter I don't think the person I or people that I that I that I I don't think
01:09:10 they're on twitter oh okay this is this is your this is your special just for you
01:09:17 girl I mean not every not everyone who's on only fans is on twitter but many of them I mean that's
01:09:23 just what yeah many yeah many yeah because it's like the one social media platform where you could
01:09:29 post like Vaj and Bube for uh without getting in trouble uh it's probably true that it's probably
01:09:36 true that most of them are that's probably true I stopped going on only fans when I realized that
01:09:44 they you don't get good you don't get good payout they take a big cut of your money
01:09:50 what they take like forward they take like 20 it's kind of a big cut yeah yeah it is a big
01:09:55 cut I know a lot of people go like on fansly I don't know how it's the same it's the same cut I
01:10:00 actually looked into it and it's the same cut on fansly that's a shame I guess like I guess
01:10:04 then the idea is like oh they just go do both platforms I'd rather I'd rather do safe content
01:10:10 and get a better cut is there is there like a meaningful difference between uh doing one
01:10:16 versus the other I'm not necessarily I assumed only fans was just better because it's probably
01:10:22 got a bigger user base because more people have heard of it I I think I think the fact that like
01:10:27 I mean that's probably the bigger reason why people still use only fan is because more people
01:10:30 have heard of only fan so like even if they take a bigger cut you still guaranteed more people than
01:10:36 yeah yeah fansly or the alternatives although I see a lot of people kind of branching out
01:10:40 and doing other things did I did I mention that thing about how in that vlog Trixie said that she
01:10:47 thought that if she had joined only fans uh when when someone told her to that she could single
01:10:53 handedly have changed its reputation to be not just for for porn people I heard of it oh it's
01:11:00 super funny she yeah there's there's a there's a there's a picnic adventure where she and Bert are
01:11:05 driving and she's going she's talking about something it doesn't matter but she she's
01:11:09 straight up says like yeah if I had joined only fans at such a such time she says I made
01:11:14 patreon's reputation what it was because I was one of the first people to be successful on patreon
01:11:19 I basically made patreon what it was so if I had joined only fans when it when someone told me to
01:11:25 if I joined it at that time I would have single handedly changed it so that its reputation was
01:11:30 not just for sluts that's her her her wording now mine uh it it would have been for everyone
01:11:36 but unfortunately but I didn't do that so we live in the in the alternate timeline that's so
01:11:39 stupid it's so stupid it's so stupid on many levels because like many levels because the
01:11:46 thing about patreon is not even true at all she was never she was never in like the top
01:11:50 tier like by the time before she even joined patreon Amanda Palmer was making like $30,000 a
01:11:56 month like it's not even close I love Trixie she should livestream more and stuff like her live
01:12:03 streams her live streams are gold such as I don't have the money to give you a refund on
01:12:08 plebeian wee blu-ray just buy bends instead the ultimate uh the ultimate endorsement
01:12:14 true but I got four more please guys please just get just get these last four off my hands I'll do
01:12:20 she did rescind that comment just say she she okay she did she yes under duress she made the
01:12:26 written statement it's like I do not I do not endorse I do not endorse bends blu-rays under
01:12:31 any circumstances thank you and sorry thank you and sorry end quote she got the she got the endless
01:12:37 jess uh call she did she did get she did get the call she did get the call after the whole debacle
01:12:44 right and she's like and he's and he's like uh uh uh uh uh Trixie don't do that jessie finally had to
01:12:49 do something on the internet for once in his life jessie had to oh he actually he actually had to
01:12:55 do something or talk to someone Ben what were you Ben you fucking monster you made jessie
01:13:01 trick now I'm get out of this fucking trick she did it Trixie did it I didn't I didn't make her
01:13:05 say that I didn't make her say that I asked the question there we go no but it's kind of no but
01:13:09 everything is kind of just your fault then ultimately like I know you're you're the problem
01:13:14 you are the prototypical twitter follower everything's Trixie Trixie does something fucked up oh it
01:13:20 must be Ben it must be Ben's fault for doing the only logical thing that one could possibly do
01:13:26 under these circumstances I I don't I don't attack who but who but who made those circumstances
01:13:32 who made the market the invisible hand of which guided me to do the thing the terrible things
01:13:37 that I do the golden which it all comes back all the golden thread the the shiny golden thread of
01:13:43 hope they all come back to the same to the same spider spinning its web
01:13:51 in the branches of the studio I'm sorry all right let's let's continue let's let's go

01:17:41 called flair well maybe I don't in that episode no she doesn't have a name maybe they gave her one
01:17:48 later I think they call it because on her cutie mark is a flirtally I guess it just makes sense

01:18:59 you know you know you know this this is cool I don't know people this is really amazing
01:19:04 call me call me crazy I just think people don't really look good in nudes I just think it they
01:19:09 most people look better in person wow body-shaming humanity I think I've never seen a you never
01:19:15 seen a new uh a good no it's not that I've never seen a good nude it's just it's just that uh I've
01:19:20 seen I've had I've had I've had sexual partners if you can believe it and in my opinion I don't
01:19:28 think I've ever had I don't think I've ever known you know I've they look better in person
01:19:34 than in a photograph I think I think most people I think photographs are generally not flattering
01:19:40 most photographs are not very flattering the same okay okay but like I think you can't have a good
01:19:46 nude I think a lot of people like nude sending is not very isn't a very high art no don't people
01:19:54 don't bring like photography degrees to that some of them do if they're if they've got like an
01:20:00 account but it so so so that being the case if it's not if it's not a flattering picture that's
01:20:06 like very gotta learn how to take better picture then why do I want to see it I don't you'll look
01:20:11 you'll look better in person the thing is that the thing yeah true I agree in person is way better
01:20:16 but like I think there's something kind of like there's something kind of hot about the amateurness
01:20:22 of it in my opinion you know the amateur point it's like its own category um well it's there's
01:20:27 something kind of like yeah attractive about the the confidence something human the confidence
01:20:33 I get that I get the decision to do it in the first place is nice uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so I yeah I get
01:20:40 it yeah especially if they do like you know you know actually I mean yeah you know I kind of agree
01:20:50 with that actually you kind of turn me around on it if there's like if it's like you kind of turn
01:20:54 me on on that yeah nice um okay good that's yeah that's the okay that's that's gonna say guys that's
01:21:00 consent that's consent for uh the person or people I'll never tell that I'm subscribed to on only fans
01:21:08 they're not they're not very professional they're pretty but okay but it's like okay it's it's not
01:21:14 it's not what I appreciate about them is that in their unprofessionality is that I like to see them
01:21:22 in let's say in in situations I'd like to see them but I like the the amateurness of it makes it feel
01:21:28 authentic makes it feel like this is a real person doing these things it feels unstaged
01:21:36 uh uh so I mean in that sense I I completely agree I don't know if I feel quite the same
01:21:41 way about oh I took a picture of myself in a mirror I think that I I feel the same way in
01:21:50 in this one specific sense that like porn doesn't have to be like nudes but porn sometimes is more
01:21:58 like interesting and engaging when it's people characters just doing normal things and they
01:22:06 just happen to be sexy they're not like going oh look at how sexy I am and doing all this stuff
01:22:12 and yes like that sort of is like that feels fake that feels like staged when someone when a character
01:22:18 just happens to be like wrapped up in like a spiderweb or like tied up in like ropes or something
01:22:27 you know I just just natural you know they're just going they were just going about their day
01:22:31 just doing their just doing their job they're just making a living you know filing texas with
01:22:35 their titties out like bouncing around right you know I don't like a fake girl if you're wearing
01:22:40 makeup ill disgusting no makeup makeup is just a default thing you just you can you can do you
01:22:47 can wear your makeup you can wear nice things and then you can be like hanging out on a on a
01:22:53 playing a video game or like on a bench you don't need to be looking at the camera being like oh I
01:22:58 see the the yeah the real um in like a lot of like porn that you find on like sites where the girl is
01:23:06 like uh you know like the art the artifice of it is very like because because I know that because
01:23:13 they make such a big show of it it like really feels like this is acting and I can and it it's
01:23:18 like calling attention to the the fakeness of it and that's a really big like ugh I don't like
01:23:23 people cannot act right at least they don't need to if they're pretty enough right so they don't
01:23:28 need to learn how right I am yeah yeah yeah yeah one of these days I'm gonna direct a very like
01:23:40 weird porno where I'm it's gonna be one of those things where like when people pass around a clip
01:23:46 of something that seems funny and weird and then everyone in the comments like uh they people
01:23:51 don't know there's no porno remember remember that lemon thing remember that thing with like it was
01:23:55 a lemon party no not lemon the lemon stealing whore yes yes lemon stealing whore that's the one oh
01:24:02 yeah uh with the James Dean love that I don't even really even remember what happens in it I just
01:24:08 remember that James Dean and a lemon tree and a lemon stealing whore there's two porn stars and
01:24:14 they're like sitting on their bench and they're like oh I love our backyard yeah me too I also love
01:24:18 my lemon tree yeah let's look at our lemon tree right now and and I'm not even exaggerating this
01:24:22 was exactly the dialogue so they look at their lemon tree and there's this woman who is the
01:24:27 self-titled lemon stealing whore she um she's stealing their lemons and she put in it in her
01:24:32 like I figure she's wearing like a onesie kind of thing like a onesie bikini kind of thing and
01:24:37 they're like hey that's the lemon stealing whore and like we only see the intro of this I imply
01:24:41 they potentially I think they punish the lemon stealing whore in like a sexual way yeah that's
01:24:46 what I would have done in that situation as well yeah if I were to catch a lemon stealing whore
01:24:51 my backyard to catch a lemon stealing whore I'm glad you remember you remember this better than I
01:24:55 do I'm really glad because I thought I might have like hallucinated this you know you know how you
01:25:00 know why that video like what the reason why that video got me the first place and this was like
01:25:05 early like YouTube why back when like people could see what what you like like every video you like
01:25:12 you know um and you know you know the person who originally like spread it through their likes
01:25:17 and everyone in the comment section was kind of like oh I did so and so like this was um it was
01:25:23 eagle raptor eagle raptor oh that's like yeah if you yeah and we can remember going when I watched
01:25:30 that video originally because I saw that for an eagle raptor like because I was like oh I love eagle
01:25:34 raptor and then I see is like what the fuck 11 ceiling horn is likes and I click and then everyone's
01:25:39 comments like oh why did Aaron like this because it's probably because the same reason a billion
01:25:44 other people liked it yeah at the time he was doing like that little he was doing those little
01:25:50 animation where it was called lemon and lemon and bill yeah yeah lemon and bill yeah and they um
01:25:55 and people were like oh he's looking for lemon and bill material lemon and lemon stealing bill
01:26:02 yeah let's ceiling bill yeah that was that was the time uh rest in peace eagle raptor
01:26:06 it'll be you'll never be forgotten those were the days never you never be forgotten that's right
01:26:12 did you know that game grumps still exists and and not only that it's like if you look at it's like
01:26:18 I can still hear the voice of Danny sex bang uh on the wind now they're doing thumbnails now where
01:26:25 they're doing like the the default youtuber gamer where they've got their photograph of
01:26:30 themself doing a whore face with the picture of the game next to them I was no longer the old
01:26:35 orange and the little faces that's that's amazing actually I can't it's so it's so different and
01:26:42 it's like well contents about about the same they're just sitting on a couch that's so weird
01:26:47 laughing and talking it's like you know I was yeah I was considering thumbnails for my uh for the
01:26:53 video the the twitch announcement video and I was I was picking out like which pictures of like
01:26:59 screen caps of myself from uh to use and I was just picking out and just thinking like you know
01:27:06 you kind of want to look deranged like you kind of want to look like you're a freak in the thumbnail
01:27:12 like like like mr beast like mr beast I don't know I think mr beast is extremely off-putting
01:27:18 looking especially the fakes he makes and all his thumbnail I mean and I'm not I know I'm not the
01:27:22 only person that thinks this but yeah it's not uh it's not like a it's not a an accident that he
01:27:29 chooses photos to look kind of freaky you I think that's just been a thing for a long time there's
01:27:33 something compelling about like a sort of deranged looking guy or something I don't know how to explain
01:27:40 it there but it has to be on purpose it has to be like an intentional thing I think I think a little
01:27:46 while ago a few years ago there was a trend of using like um like photoshop to like enlarge
01:27:54 the eyes and the teeth and to make it like look like absurdly horrifically different than a human
01:28:01 face like if you look if you look at it it looks really weird that trend has gone away a little
01:28:05 bit because it's a little too scary there's there's some that still works there's something yeah even
01:28:09 if it's not like good it's there's something that just grabs you about yeah like a human face
01:28:15 with some sort of like visual interest even if it's a negative interest but if like the eyes and
01:28:20 the teeth are really big your face goes right to it it's like a like a jump scare it's like ah
01:28:24 like um when you see it yeah it's really a sad and pathetic that that is how everything looks
01:28:31 if you want to maximize like clickability you have to be the same kind of a freak but I want
01:28:38 varieties of freaks you know there's a certain kind of thing that the human brain dreams
01:28:44 there's a certain kind of thing that the human brain just sees and has a visceral
01:28:49 reaction to and it's just all about getting that it's that reaction I think what I I like
01:28:56 book covers I like album covers those are cool this was on them I'll read them if they had if
01:29:02 like imagine if like albums and stuff were all physical now and then I mean they are physical
01:29:07 but like you know what I mean like albums like albums like you go you don't go to Spotify to
01:29:12 find albums you go to the store and they've got all these albums CDs and whatever but they've
01:29:19 all got the artist they've got the artist on the front cover doing well oh my god I can't believe
01:29:25 I made this sort of like face and like that's what gets people to buy it you travel to like
01:29:32 an alternate reality where everything is the same like there's no change except for one thing
01:29:38 and that's like the the album for Beatles rubber soul is them doing like the soy face pointing
01:29:44 and they're pointing at their own music yeah they're pointing at their album it's like a slip
01:29:50 so you could pull it out you could pull out the part where they're like pointing and it's like
01:29:53 the regular album cover but this is yeah I was gonna say earlier this kind of reminds me of
01:30:04 there's this like there's this kind of theory that like stupid insane people have where like
01:30:12 people were saying something about like have you noticed that you're just kind of just naturally
01:30:15 scared of like pale horrific faces and like you know maybe maybe maybe it's because like back then
01:30:25 our ancestors saw some sort of subspecies creature that maybe was a pale evil monster thing and it's
01:30:30 ingrained in our DNA and that's why we're scared of it and it's beyond fucking stupid it's because
01:30:36 it's like well like there's a lot of reasons now to kind of be scared of someone pale or scary looking
01:30:42 than like something stupid and like oh it's at one point there was actually pale scary looking
01:30:48 monsters who lived on earth and they and they were like one of the one of the lesser oh this is like
01:30:53 an eight this is like an alien yeah yeah um well not not necessarily an alien but that like there
01:30:58 could there's just a creature like that that is kind of like the way people talk about it they
01:31:03 seem to explain it some sort of like one of the several subspecies of sapien that exists like
01:31:09 what like early man was developing because there was like a shitload of different like subspecies
01:31:13 I mean there's lots of ways for a face to look uncanny and alarming and like yeah being being
01:31:20 extremely pale I guess is one of them but it's like right definitely not the only one it's like
01:31:27 a weird kind of thing or like someone out there heard about the whole thing what assassins create
01:31:32 where it's like oh do you know that like your entire family history is near a dna and shit like that
01:31:38 and that like kind of crops up back and it's like oh what if like what if like your great great great
01:31:43 great grandpa saw like a spooky monster and it traumatized him so bad that it like passed on
01:31:47 and now that's why you're traumatizing spooky monsters that's what we call lamarky that's what
01:31:52 we call lamarky and uh genetics you know about those malarky and more like more like malarky
01:32:00 lamarky said that like he thought that like the reason giraffes have long necks is because like
01:32:07 previous generations had to like they had to reach up with their necks to try and grab high fruit
01:32:13 and he thought that that physical activity like like physically stretched their neck out and that
01:32:18 and that then the giraffes would have babies and they would and they would pass that trade
01:32:22 on to their offspring and it was because they had developed it through like you know through their
01:32:27 the physical uh uh mechanical action through the through the grind set right yeah yeah it was not
01:32:32 that it was a natural selection by like gene mutation um so that's gene that's what that is it's
01:32:39 like oh your grandpa got really scared by a ghost so and he got so scared that he like it like he
01:32:45 learned that associate and then he and then his kid he's it was it was locked into his DNA from
01:32:50 that point on yeah so he gave birth to kids it's we're also scared of ghosts it's it's like it's
01:32:56 just like in the bible they said uh what it was like joseph or some fucking some fucking antediluvian
01:33:02 guy god was like hey god hey i'll tell you a trick to make to breed goats with stripes and they and
01:33:09 so he said cut stripes into a stick and put the stick in a water and then have the goats drink
01:33:13 the water and then their babies will have stripes and they did what fucking magic and hey and you
01:33:21 know that you know what else yes yes and you know the other part that's in the same chapter where they
01:33:26 describe uh the circular pool whose ratio of its diameter to its circumference is exactly three
01:33:34 lamal
01:33:37 whoa if you pi pi is i can't believe the number three is in pi is exactly three god according to
01:33:44 to the bible lamal
01:33:47 and talk about the bible okay all right all right that's my that's it i've said enough
01:33:54 that's that's our that's our weekly bible rant where we're talking about
01:33:59 we were talking about give and take dot say we weren't but let's do that
01:34:04 hey did you know that my website is is new now yeah it's been a lot of work getting it
01:34:12 getting it working and and stuff but it's not really much of like a big update until i have
01:34:16 new stuff to put on there but i'm i'm proud of it because it's you know so it's a lot of it's a lot
01:34:23 of uh it's my stuff it's my domain it's my little castle and i like that it's it's now no longer
01:34:32 associated with wordpress and i have a lot more control over the hgml and and all the stuff take
01:34:38 dot site uh and i'm gonna have like links to my to amazon so you can buy the chlorissa gun smoke
01:34:44 book right on the site oh yeah and it's easy it's gonna be easy to like uh well it is easy to like

01:35:14 will be like tomorrow yeah cool um you know i should link your link the site oh yeah well i mean
01:35:22 you know what i guess as soon as they work i'll i'm gonna buy a copy of chlorissa gun smoke in the
01:35:27 bandit king i i guess i'll be i guess is it is it $15 plus shipping or is it just 15 uh yeah we'll
01:35:36 be plus shipping but you pay for it and it'll be shipped from america's they print it in the country
01:35:41 that it's probably going to be shipped to so there's really good shipping actually it's like two bucks
01:35:46 probably amazing can you you know how if you buy like $25 worth of stuff on amazon you get free
01:35:51 shipping can i like uh or maybe is that just an american thing i know i'm i'm pretty sure i mean
01:35:59 it'll i i don't know i wonder if i could include that in my type of item i wonder that i could
01:36:03 include that in my amazon order a copy of chlorissa gun smoke and a jar of a of a corn fiber please
01:36:13 to add up to $25 to get that that's what you should do everyone should should add a chlorissa
01:36:17 gun smoke volume to their shopping cart to save on delivery fee exactly you you can't afford you
01:36:23 can't afford not to and then and the corn fiber of course too and corn pop yeah what ben said
01:36:34 obviously but in in the course of of making the site i had to like go through all of my comics
01:36:40 again uh bail jake is great bail jake is really fun i should reread it it's been a while i love bail
01:36:47 jake i love ken and story i even love horse stuck even though it's like really really old and uh digi
01:36:54 is in there yeah right at the end uh boy i had to scroll way back to see that i think it's a great
01:37:02 feeling when you go back to your older work and you still think it like looks good you know yeah
01:37:08 a lot yeah i mean it's obviously like worse drawing than what i could do now like the the
01:37:14 things i tried my hardest at i remember certain panels that like oh i tried my hardest to make
01:37:18 this look good and it just sort of is okay but now i could do so much better uh a part of me
01:37:23 was thinking like oh when i do the volume one of villain verse where i have the the prologue to
01:37:29 chapter six maybe i should go back and redraw a couple those panels so they look a little bit
01:37:33 better but then i i look at those panels and i'm like ah this still looks good i still looks good
01:37:39 i don't need to change anything it you know it's still serviceable very i still think
01:37:46 about about which comic you're talking about uh villain verse are you still doing it are you
01:37:52 still gonna do more villain verse oh yeah i've been yeah okay i think i mentioned it before that um
01:37:58 i kind of put that on pause because uh it's not yeah making me it's not making me as much money as i
01:38:04 thought it would i've been trying to focus on more kind of like comics that will help me
01:38:08 stand out i understand i understand i i i get you because uh this should this should
01:38:15 as tough i um i hate i hate talking to other artists i think me too terrible people you know
01:38:22 you know i was joking but go on i might i might agree with you even more okay so what i what i mean
01:38:29 is that um so every time i like i'm not every time but there's a there's a there's a certain group
01:38:34 there's a certain type of artist that every time i tell him like yeah like what's kind of annoying
01:38:39 i mean i'm basically just complaining about like oh man i'm not making a living tough tough to make
01:38:43 money isn't yeah yeah exactly and then this person is always like dude who cares about the money
01:38:50 dude it's all about you know it's all about making art for yourself man all cool all cool shut the
01:38:55 fuck up shut up you fucking monster yeah i hate yeah i do people actually say that do people
01:39:00 actually say that in casual conversation people do say that to me like yeah i mean it's that's
01:39:07 yeah that's not reading the room at all if you're having trouble with money and you need the money
01:39:12 because you do need the money because everyone needs my job my job my job sure is hard my job
01:39:18 sure is all who cares how hard it is it's like because like i mean i get the ultimate in a perfect
01:39:27 society yeah of course you would be only making art for yourself because all that that's all that
01:39:31 matters ultimately but in this society where like i want to i want to make a living off something
01:39:37 that doesn't make me want to shoot my fucking like brains out yeah you know like and i basically
01:39:42 argue like man it sucks that like the job that i want is it making me enough i'm gonna be i'm gonna
01:39:48 be perfectly honest it's ultimately what i'm saying i'm gonna be perfectly honest i don't
01:39:51 really talk to that many other artists i talk to like gib oh i could tell how do you how could you
01:39:57 tell i could tell it's easy okay well i won't i won't ask i won't ask for any more details uh i i
01:40:06 don't uh i don't really talk to that many uh and i mean okay those when people say that something
01:40:13 like that is it people that like are they successful or are they people who are also no it's never
01:40:20 it's never successful okay it's so it's so it's cope so it's cope well it's not even like cope it's
01:40:26 kind of like i feel like because i noticed is that if if an artist has like a well-paying job and
01:40:32 then they do the art thing um obviously they don't care too much about making money off of art right
01:40:38 because they have the well-paying job and so they can do art for themselves yeah and that's fine
01:40:45 yeah um that's that's cool if you want if you want to go down that route there's no problem with
01:40:49 that but like there's something it's so it just feels kind of weirdly dismissive not like oh i want
01:40:56 to go down a route where like the stuff that i like to make is the stuff that's keeping me afloat
01:41:01 yeah and um to some people that doesn't like click like oh you should just if you like making that
01:41:07 so you should just make it and it's like yeah but you know i kind of want to kind of eat yeah i
01:41:12 gotta want to eat i kind of have rent to pay i kind of yeah it's it's it's just it's i would say i
01:41:19 guess there's two like if they're like a successful artist it's obviously hit like hypocritical of
01:41:25 him to say that if they're like yeah like wealthy or at least like their bills are paid by some other
01:41:32 thing and like they just they they're just like a hobbyist and they say that then it's like why are
01:41:38 why are you saying that like you don't you don't have the same concern as me so like fucking how
01:41:45 how dare you dismiss it like that right like who who are you to tell me oh don't worry about that
01:41:51 fuck yourself uh and then yeah if if they're if they're also struggling and they're then then like
01:41:58 i could see i could see someone who's like also doing that just being it is like cope this is
01:42:02 like oh it's it's not about the money it's just about it's about uh it's about the passion
01:42:08 and can i pay my bills no but you know i don't expect to uh i am a lowly worm uh this is what i
01:42:16 deserve yeah i i think um what i was gonna say another thing that i also kind of like
01:42:24 in the same vein as this is like uh can i tell people that like i i aim to make
01:42:30 stuff that like i try to make stuff that like is like popular like that can be popular you know
01:42:37 and a lot of like other i guess the same kind of artists who's like just drawing for themselves
01:42:41 like raises an eyebrow to that like comment because they're like oh you should try to make
01:42:47 stuff that appeals to you you should make art for yourself oh you should just make the art you
01:42:52 want to see uh have they ever had bakuman it's literally all about it's all about the reader
01:42:58 surveys nothing else matters except the reader surveys i with me i like to um i like to i i
01:43:08 talk about this i i've tried to talk about this on other podcasts and i keep getting interrupted
01:43:12 but hey i hey actually i mean you didn't talk about the pcb website for a second not going
01:43:18 sorry but but basically and i think i have mentioned it before on this podcast is like
01:43:23 there's the art that like um that feeds your soul but doesn't make you any money and then there's the
01:43:28 art that like can make money but like kind of hurts your soul and you want to hit the middle
01:43:32 ground of that like right because no because no one's like a complete contrarian where they like
01:43:37 you don't like something that's popular right like you there's gotta be everyone likes at least
01:43:41 one thing that's like popular and yeah and if you're an artist you should like think about
01:43:45 what are the popular things you like and that and try to do your version of that popular thing you
01:43:50 know yeah um because that's gonna like keep you afloat actually i would yeah go on someone said
01:43:56 i think it might have been like i just heard someone say i think it might have been majulaar
01:44:02 in a video not that long ago or someone i heard some youtuber just they it was not even relevant
01:44:08 who had said it but someone said like a lot someone just commented that like a lot of art
01:44:14 this reminded me the art is a lot of the time it's about like you just see someone else
01:44:19 do something and you just think that sucked i i could do that better like i could do that
01:44:24 better than that person get and then you and then you do it and then you try to do it and
01:44:28 just prove that you you could do it better than that other person did it and that's just where a
01:44:32 lot of art comes from yeah and that's fine that's like uh i i love that that's like when you do
01:44:38 something out of spite which is great not even out of spite it's it's just if you i mean it's
01:44:44 stupid example but that reminds me of like the pony the pony scene back the pony review scene i
01:44:49 saw other idiots making pony reviews and i was like well this any you could do a better pony review
01:44:55 than this and i did that's how it that's how it starts i remember i kind of had that same
01:45:02 mentality when i made my first like short film in high school because there was like a a senior
01:45:08 at the time and i was doing your who made a short made a short horror short film and everyone loved
01:45:13 that everyone thought like oh that was great and awesome and epic but i was like dude you literally
01:45:17 just ripped off a creepy pasta like i know this creepy pasta and he passed it off as like his
01:45:22 his own work and i'm like ah dude this will aim as fuck dude i could make something scarier and
01:45:26 original and i like the thing i did you know my short film was very weird it was very particular
01:45:33 like i i thought i thought it was funny i guess i think a lot of time did not get it i guess we'll
01:45:39 never know um it's still on it's still on youtube it's called it's on my cheesy's do even dare to
01:45:44 watch it's on my cheesy uh classic channel it's called the dog man okay i've ever even seen that
01:45:52 channel uh it used to be used to be called well link link link it if you dare but i guess we don't
01:45:58 have time to watch it right now i don't i don't want to link it okay okay okay just take my word
01:46:04 for it it was really good i totally blew that guy out of the water it destroyed that guy yeah his
01:46:11 is he was like he was shaking he became a little quiet after dog man came out he was a little a
01:46:16 little silent interesting interesting you know yeah speaking speaking of oh oh no are you going
01:46:22 yeah god i was just gonna say that yeah i just kind of i'm annoyed by those kinds of people um i
01:46:28 think it's pretty cringe to not understand that like an artist would want to do art as a living
01:46:37 and therefore the the struggle to make it a profitable venture is like really obviously
01:46:45 important and what kind of a f***ing flawed wouldn't wouldn't appreciate that
01:46:50 i mean i i want to play devil's advocate for just a second no no to these types of people
01:46:55 die die die um when they say just do things that make you happy or could they be referring to like
01:47:05 art that is successful being good because the artist who made it like doing it
01:47:13 no like that happens yeah that happens obviously it may be a very misguided because it's like they
01:47:19 only know that's that's that's that's that's such a uh that's such a but that's probably where their
01:47:25 mind is when they say that might be where their mind is i would think but that's such as like a
01:47:28 survivorship bias thing because when you when you look at like comics that are really successful
01:47:33 and maybe the artist behind them is like i just draw what i like and it's just what they draw is
01:47:39 like something that's wildly popular it's like then it's simply it's just a coincidence like
01:47:44 this they're just lucky that like the thing that they really like to draw just happens to be the
01:47:49 thing that the zeitgeist is like really into and and it was became successful like you can't you
01:47:54 can't just you can't generalize that advice to everyone because most people if they just draw
01:48:00 whatever appeals to them most it wouldn't people wouldn't care uh they have they have to think
01:48:07 about how can i how can i make this something make this into something that the people like
01:48:13 that's my cope though i still think that if i care about what i'm doing then people will be like
01:48:18 oh you know what to a certain extent it's true but i don't think it's good general advice for
01:48:23 like how to make it in the art scene no i mean i don't know how to make it in the scene because i
01:48:28 mostly have money from podcasts i think um true i think it i think yeah there's a lucky few out there
01:48:36 who like the art they want to make is already stuff that's like super popular so they're like oh
01:48:43 yeah oh wow hot wow the guy who uh the guy who drew fuck when did undertale come out like 2015
01:48:49 something something like that 2015 the guy who just was just drawing his own undertale
01:48:54 art in 2015 got super popular because oh obviously he was just drawing from the heart right well not
01:48:59 that coincidentally at the same time he was really into a game that was super popular at the time you
01:49:04 know yeah like that that can't be it yeah right there's like all these like like yeah there's like
01:49:10 all these like other things that people don't like speak taking count speaking for counterpoint
01:49:15 my work is great and people will look back and say wow i wish i was a fan of gibb earlier and then
01:49:21 i would be a cooler but nobody but nobody but nobody will find nobody will find you i'm sorry
01:49:27 but nobody's gonna find you through Clarissa they're gonna find you through other stuff
01:49:32 and if and if they stick around then they'll read Clarissa and it'll be good and it'll
01:49:37 i understand this i that's why i'm i'm trying to like during Clarissa or maybe afterwards
01:49:45 make a few videos make a few youtube videos see if i can get some of that back
01:49:49 so i can i can advertise again yeah send people that way having a good website that's like good
01:49:57 and not shit would also do some some good you know like having a having a good presenting
01:50:03 front-facing base of operations that people can go to like i'm setting things up and i think it's
01:50:09 it's gonna work guys it's just gonna work no i believe you i believe uh speaking of okay
01:50:17 two things one i do want to mention about websites the pcp website when the ova is out

01:52:43 fight spider-man so he can't spread his nudes speaking of oh i want a green symbiote because
01:52:48 it'd be like slime ha ha um uh ben slime ben ben smeels uh speaking of all that shit speaking
01:52:56 of piggybacking off of popular things uh to get popular uh my mega man video the the reason why
01:53:03 i rushed and got that uh that uh twitch announcement video out today or yesterday was because uh
01:53:09 mega man video is getting a big third wave it's getting like a big third uh like like uh wind
01:53:16 i think it's because uh i think it's because the battle network legacy collection is like
01:53:22 being announced it's gonna come out like next month uh it's it's uh we're doing we're doing
01:53:29 numbers we're doing numbers here i'll show you i'll show you the last 28 days of numbers on this graph
01:53:34 right here see you're lucky you've got you've got mega man that you care about you make a video about
01:53:40 that you care about mega man i don't care about mega man i would never force myself to care about
01:53:44 mega man listen here's the here's the thing i plan i planned for all this because i knew i knew that
01:53:50 mega man that the legacy collection was coming out and that mega man 11 had just surpassed mega
01:53:55 man 2 as like as like uh uh the best-selling mega man of all time so there's like renewed
01:54:01 interest there's renewed fan interest and there's renewed corporate interest in the franchise
01:54:06 and i knew that they have like bigger projects in the works that are still a secret but had
01:54:10 that have like huge budgets put to them i knew that there were going to be big mega man developments
01:54:14 coming in the future so i was like i need to do this now i need to make the definitive mega man
01:54:19 video that everybody's gonna want to watch when 10 years from now some big fucking thing comes out
01:54:25 and everyone is like what's mega man and they'll youtube and they'll go on youtube and they'll
01:54:29 say mega man lore and they'll see an eight hour video explaining and they'll be like guess how
01:54:33 watch that and it's happening it's paying off and then they'll get to the bit we talk about the pcp
01:54:39 and they're like what well maybe they'll click maybe they'll click past them maybe they'll click
01:54:42 past the intro it's too long huh look like click past the intro um anyway third wind baby
01:54:51 where is my mega man i bet if i were you um to make a to make a mega man comic no at this point
01:54:59 no um but here's the ticket just just retell the entire mega man story but don't
01:55:07 but change everyone's names everyone's like proxy characters it's really funny also make it edgy
01:55:11 and cyberpunk mega man axe is already the edgy cyberpunk version of uh of mega man it's really
01:55:19 funny i went to a local this was a couple years ago i went to i was invited to a local it was at
01:55:26 a college it was a meeting of like the the comics it was like a comics club at this college yeah
01:55:33 and it was a it was a bunch of hacks it was a bunch of you know it was college kids
01:55:38 it was it we thought they they were just they were just they had oc's they were just talking
01:55:42 about their oc's and they were like yeah i've been working on this i've been working on this
01:55:45 comic for like eight years now i've been working on it for eight years haven't started drawing it yet
01:55:49 but you know i'll uh yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be really good uh and one guy was talking about
01:55:56 his comic his comic idea and he's describing the plot of his comic idea and he talks for several
01:56:01 minutes and i'm sitting there and he's talking about yeah it's the future there's robots that are
01:56:06 that are alive there's uh you know they some of them go crazy uh there's a rebellion uh certain
01:56:12 good robots have to form a team to fight against the bad robots that are rebellious wow he's talking
01:56:18 listen there's more there's layers because he's saying all this and i'm looking at him and he's
01:56:23 wearing a mega man shirt and i'm like i'm just looking at him i'm like yeah yeah that sounds
01:56:29 pretty good yeah that's it's compelling yeah that's pretty good and then he talks for like five
01:56:33 or ten minutes about this idea for this this comic series that he wants to do and he gets to the end
01:56:39 and he goes like yeah so basically it's mega man like i basically just ripped off mega man
01:56:45 and i was like you know what okay i respect it at least at least he cops to it so at least he
01:56:52 under at least he appreciates that about his pitch so i couldn't be that mad i can't i can't
01:56:58 imagine working on a comic in your head for eight years and not it's literally just like
01:57:04 they have an oc they have an oc that they have stories about in their head and some maybe occasionally
01:57:10 they sketch them in a notebook and they think this would make a great comic one day and that's what
01:57:15 they mean by i've been working on this comic for eight years i cannot comprehend doing ideas that
01:57:21 are eight years old because like you're like a different person by then and it's like here's
01:57:26 the kind of trick if you have a genius idea right now that you think like oh i'm gonna say this for
01:57:30 later no do it now because like even in a year or so you're gonna like think that idea is not that
01:57:35 good some people have so i just do it now some people have uh like since they were kids even
01:57:41 they have like a cast of characters in their head that they've thought up and they've just continued
01:57:45 to like think of like scenarios for these characters to do you know who's like you know
01:57:52 who's like that is is emily ree you know emily ree that sounds she's a comic she does she does a
01:57:59 comic called anarchy dreamers and uh she's on twitter and that's that's her comic she's had
01:58:04 these these ocs for like uh you know since she was like a kid a teenager whatever and she's just been
01:58:11 i mean it's fine to like use concepts you've had lying around i just it's the it's the sense that
01:58:15 like anarchy you haven't like made anarchy dreamers okay look out right now um sure because i also
01:58:25 have like a bunch of like characters i guess a lot of them were invented in the process of like
01:58:32 making shit up while i was drawing bell jpe and stuff but like oh and like uh rfck lord of ghosts
01:58:41 i made up because it was like a fun character to play yeah yeah i don't really have anything from
01:58:47 childhood no i'm either no i'm either i think um yeah i think i mean her she's like the exception
01:58:56 i think also the creator of bone uh jeff smith he came up with the bone characters the bone
01:59:02 cousins when he was like a little kid because it's like he was a big fan of this comic strip called
01:59:08 pogo and it's like a possum character and he and he drew the main character um phone bone
01:59:16 is based on pogo and pogo and because bone phone bone looks kind of like pogo but like hairless
01:59:23 and that's kind of where he based the idea for all the bone characters and if you look up the art of
01:59:28 bone he he adds like his old like children like his old comics that he made when he was a kid
01:59:34 with with phone bone and phony bone and their design has that it literally never changed at all it's
01:59:39 like been the same since he was a kid um i've never i've never read i mean lucky for oh bone is
01:59:45 fucking a lot of big bone is bone is a real comics nerd's uh favorite comic like your favorite
01:59:52 comic artist's favorite comic is bone i saw it on a library once and i read a bunch of it and it was
01:59:58 like it was really really well drawn and funny and woody and and just it was great i really should
02:00:05 find more issues for more volumes yeah you gotta like you gotta like get that um you're probably
02:00:12 i feel like even the color version the the scholastic like really so the books are pretty good
02:00:18 i know there's like complete like versions of bone but um it's fucking it's fucking great uh
02:00:25 10 out of 10 every time like every time i see motherfuckers complaining about like oh like it's
02:00:30 so hard to get into like oh man uh western comics are dying i saw you've been you've been retreating
02:00:37 that you were retreating that one about like oh the manga section is bigger and i'm over here
02:00:42 thinking like oh please just read daniel claus please the reason it's so simple the reason the
02:00:48 manga section is bigger is because print manga is just a bigger business in japan because there's
02:00:54 just bigger demand there's bigger financial demand for serialized fucking print comics it's
02:01:01 literally just there's more money in it over there it's so and it's also kind of like every
02:01:07 time i see anyone complain every time someone makes this kind of tweet they're usually and they keep
02:01:12 it nice and vague i usually also see them talking about how like and the reason why is because of
02:01:18 comics keep pushing progressive politics right you'd have to be so fucking stupid not to see it's
02:01:23 because there's more fucking money in it you fucking idiot they pay them more it's a bigger
02:01:29 industry it's it's just so yeah it's it's really fucking annoying i really it's because they made
02:01:36 april o'neill well she was already black but they made her black and fat in the new change and that
02:01:42 was too far that ended calm ended western comics yeah exactly took the words right out of my mouth
02:01:50 and it's it's a shame there's a lot of really good like there's a lot of like really good comics
02:01:55 out there that aren't like big two superhero stuff i i try to mostly recommend non big two
02:02:01 like superhero stuff um yeah because it's just so much like like better damn i was thinking about
02:02:09 but but there's but there's not but there's not as much of it not as much of it comes out
02:02:14 that there no a lot of it does come out um it's just that like you don't like people don't talk
02:02:19 about it mostly that's kind of it i i think i think manga in japan is like
02:02:27 there's so many mangaka just churning it out for so many different publications
02:02:33 we just don't we just don't have the culture of that over here it's not it's not it's simply not
02:02:39 the same ecosystem i agree yeah i think i think that's the main difference well i mean but by
02:02:47 the same token a lot of the western comics a lot of the non-western like stuff like daniel
02:02:52 claus and stuff it's kind of like you know it's very it's very like kind of high it's a lot of
02:02:57 highbrow stuff uh you know 100 100 bullets or whatever uh uh uh you know whereas like yeah
02:03:05 the manga section is really big because there's a lot more schlock there's tons more schlock manga
02:03:12 coming out and it's just because they need to fill pages you know it's just cheaper to make and
02:03:17 yeah like people say like oh it's hard to get into but i'm like i feel like people get into
02:03:21 comics the same way they get into manga which is usually just recommendations right because like
02:03:26 yeah how many times was the last time you get into barnes and noble and thought like oh i've
02:03:30 literally never heard of this manga i'm gonna get it uh no you usually don't know if the last time
02:03:36 that happened was when i must have been like 14 13 12 and i went into walden books and i bought a
02:03:44 copy of ragnarok you know what that is yeah i know what that is the manga the manga yeah wait it's
02:03:53 it's not a manga because it's korean uh but it's a manhwa wife i thought manhwa was when it was on the
02:04:00 phone uh what was before it was before like webtoon because i'm old remember there's a western
02:04:08 comic called the ragnarok yeah a lot of things called ragnarok here here this one this one um
02:04:14 i just bought it because i thought i had a cool art style yeah and that was when i was like uh
02:04:19 yeah probably like 13 i was um i was lucky that i grew up like going to the public library like
02:04:26 religiously like i went like every week and what i did was that i would just read any comic if it
02:04:32 just looked interesting to me if i wait if i remember correctly i think that ragnarok
02:04:41 had like in the in the ending section along with like letters from the editor and stuff
02:04:46 i think it had the characters like statted out in like d&d stat blocks if i'm if i'm not
02:04:57 insane if i'm not completely imagining that which means that it was it was they it was marketed
02:05:04 specifically to me nerdy nerdy white nerdy white young high schooler
02:05:10 done for that nerdy white money so now that i think about it i feel it's shameful and now
02:05:15 and now i'm noticing oh my god it was published by tokyo pop no what have i done does it have an
02:05:22 over the oh is it ragnarok i guess may might technically be ragnarok ragnarok is it is it
02:05:30 kind of like a thing or like um what uh what japanese people do in english words where they just
02:05:36 pick words that sound cool i think koreans don't know what how's that little thing is supposed
02:05:41 to be pronounced so i i look at this i look at this and i and i think remember those d&d stat
02:05:47 blocks and i think this was probably made specifically for the west even though it's
02:05:54 by a korean artist uh this this says like made for the western market too much to me market
02:06:02 that's just that's just a hunch but uh um lamal there's god i need to get i just want to become
02:06:10 big enough that i can just recommend um there's this channel i think i mentioned that before
02:06:14 but they're called the cartoonist k fave have you heard of this channel no it's run by two um two
02:06:21 guys two comic creators who work in the industry um ed piscor and jim rug and they're both really
02:06:29 cool i really like their stuff um and and they they got a pretty popular like they're a pretty
02:06:35 popular channel with like people who like like comics and what i like about them is that they
02:06:40 they shine spotlights on like more obscure kind of stuff and they they interview all sorts of people
02:06:45 like they recently interviewed both creators of tmnt um and i think um but they talk about
02:06:53 something called the k fave effect and what it is is that like they there's this thing where like
02:06:59 they'll talk about an obscure comic and then the literally right after the video drops on ebay the
02:07:05 price for that comic goes like it's skyrockets because everyone just keeps like looking for it
02:07:10 like oh shit like where is it like i want to read it and that's happened a couple time with me when
02:07:14 they talk about something like obscure like oh you guys heard about this comic and i'm like oh that
02:07:18 comic looks so cool i want to get it and then like i look it up and i'm like wow that shit
02:07:23 cranked up in price because everyone had the idea and even now what they do is that on their
02:07:27 patreon they drop the videos early so those comics like go up in price even before they drop on youtube
02:07:34 right and i i think that's so cool because it's like oh now more people are getting into more
02:07:41 kind of the obscure things right yeah and um it's it's really badass and i want to like i want to
02:07:49 get to that point where i just could just recommend something obscure and it just kind of like blows
02:07:54 up i really i really wish would be pretty rad to be able to do that yeah right it acid that was
02:08:02 also kind of like i think also i think a big thing that would probably help um western comics is if
02:08:10 if we get like more like animated adaptations you know but not but not exactly like not exactly
02:08:16 like another spider-man cartoon put them on netflix we should i wonder if netflix is making any
02:08:21 cartoons i think they've got some budget for for for some new animated productions i think um i think
02:08:26 what i want is something kind of like just just just make good adaptations of things kind of like
02:08:33 when the walking dance started or like or like the boys or like invincible because when those shows
02:08:38 like first came out and they got super popular you know more like invisible because nobody watched
02:08:43 it that's not true you go on um you go on amazon and i look up oh what's like the best selling
02:08:50 comic on amazon that's not a manga and it'd be like invincible or the boys actually at
02:08:56 during the heights of the popularity of the dough shows the boys and invincible are like
02:09:00 outselling manga they're outselling like super popular things and i mean they just kind of just
02:09:06 happens when like oh when the chainsaw man anime dropped uh the chainsaw man was like
02:09:11 the best selling a manga on amazon you know and it like but i i mean i feel like we need more kind
02:09:16 of like we need more kind of like banger series that are based on like um i mean i guess the
02:09:21 the annoying part is that the boys and invincible is still related to like superheroes but i think
02:09:26 the nice thing about the boys and invincible is that it literally you start with volume one or
02:09:32 volume one volume one with the boys or volume ones have been invincible to start the story and
02:09:36 there's like an ending you know it's not like oh you got to read like it's not like oh it's implied
02:09:41 there's like five other books that you could also like are connected to this and yada yada right
02:09:48 mm-hmm i think i think we i think we just need like just more good adaptations of like
02:09:56 just like more non superhero comics and whatnot and you know people try there's like a lot of
02:10:01 like series that like didn't really catch on like there was a preacher show and i felt like the
02:10:06 preacher show should have been way bigger than it was and i don't know why it wasn't that successful
02:10:12 um because i heard people the people who did watch said like oh it's pretty good
02:10:15 but um it just never caught on like uh the boys did or um invincible did or uh they made a they
02:10:23 made a they made like an Amazon Prime show yeah it's hard to tell they might just been they came
02:10:28 out there in the wrong time or it might be that these fucking SJW cucks made the the girl character
02:10:35 into a black woman in the adaptation you know who's to say what really caused it but yeah who's
02:10:41 to say i mean i mean uh you got your theory i got my theory uh i think it's probably communism's fault
02:10:49 but uh it's the free the free market will decide uh the free market will decide if communism wins or
02:10:56 the wins or loses my brain is my brain is too small to think of such things i'm just gonna draw
02:11:04 i'm just gonna draw
02:11:08 i just want to draw okay
02:11:12 i just just draw just draw what you want to draw you know
02:11:16 don't focus on being popular that's so nice that's so nice to imagine that just draw don't even
02:11:21 think about it just draw whatever you want to draw and the money will just start just start rolling in
02:11:27 yeah don't even post it don't even post it just throw it or you just throw it in the trash after
02:11:31 you just draw it again i was talking to someone and like they were asking me because like
02:11:36 someone literally said like no one's ever like got in popular from trying to be like popular
02:11:42 with their art hey that's the dumbest that's the stupidest fucking thing i've ever heard yeah
02:11:47 actually uh actually that's literally all that's actually what happens way more often you freaking
02:11:52 imbecile you freaking you freaking you freaking loser you gotta get your fucking get in the
02:11:58 fucking real world okay you live in a fantasy nobody's ever gotten popular by trying to get
02:12:04 popular haven't you read bakuman you it it's so it's so like funny because it's like if you're an
02:12:12 artist that has like a family you're probably more inclined to like want to make popular things
02:12:17 because you want to feed your fucking family i brought up the example of like because i brought
02:12:22 up um brought up jack Kirby as an example of an artist who was trying to do popular things and
02:12:27 i got i got like shun when i brought that up like like what no no way no because jack Kirby is
02:12:32 considered one of the greats and i do consider him one of the greats that being said that guy was
02:12:37 trying to be popular like he um there was a period actually not even a period his whole life he was
02:12:42 trying to aim to do stuff that people that he thought like oh people might like this because at one
02:12:46 point he made a comic about a jazz singer because like oh people like jazz i'm gonna make someone
02:12:51 make someone about i mean i read i read a there's a there's a thing i think it was an
02:12:56 interview with like edgar allen poe that they asked him like boy how did you come up with a raven
02:13:03 like you must have been and you must have gone into like a freaking oh you must have like you
02:13:09 were you smoking edgar allen poe were you on depression pills you must have gone into like a
02:13:14 poetic fugue state and like emerged uh uh you know days later not having written it because it's
02:13:20 such a masterpiece and he was like well uh actually you know i just uh you know horror
02:13:24 short horror was like really popular was really trending and like doing well in magazines at the
02:13:29 time and i just uh you know i just thought i could really i could do that i could really
02:13:32 capitalize on that so i just wrote it and it worked yeah i was right exactly i thought it'd be
02:13:40 popular and it was idiot uh it happens it happens just so often that people don't even fucking
02:13:46 realize it's it's literally the it's it's probably the rule it's the rule it's the rule not the
02:13:51 exception yeah it is it is so nobody even talks about it because it's so unremarkable so you
02:13:57 hear the stories of oh this person was a surprise smash hit and they were like oh well i just do
02:14:02 whatever i wanted to and everyone loved it and it's like oh so that's so that's how you get
02:14:06 popular oh that's how you become a quote surprise splash hit smash hit like it's a surprise that
02:14:12 they did that yeah despite not having any work in the industry before then oda was just drawing
02:14:18 from the heart dude he wasn't you know he was just drawing for himself and just so happened to caught
02:14:22 on i'm so sad i saw i saw the i saw the quote from a couple years ago about like oda still he's still
02:14:28 really is like really he still loves the ronnie kenshin guy he's yeah it's uh it's it's a real
02:14:36 bummer i mean i understand feeling professional professional attitude towards him for getting
02:14:41 your start in the industry uh the ronnie kenshin guy is a what's the ronnie kenshin guy is a
02:14:47 child porn betta file uh there's a resident a freaking child porn sting operation but oda like
02:14:55 he had a shitload of odas like got his start in manga he was like an assistant to the ronnie
02:15:00 kenshin guy and like he still is like yeah i love that guy like he's a great guy we're like we're
02:15:04 like comrades you know i was like working for him was like the happiest time of my life
02:15:09 and it's like i i get i get being grateful for the opportunity i if you like to work it under
02:15:14 him like that's cool you should not you should not defend that guy far under him yeah yeah you
02:15:21 know every every time like something kind of the only shonen i really like i'm up to usually i'm
02:15:27 the most up to date with his like one piece that's the only one i read yeah yeah but like every but
02:15:34 usually like that's the only shonen i'm getting like a lot of like frustration from and every time
02:15:40 i have a problem with something in one piece or any shonen i always say to myself this shit never
02:15:45 happens in hunter hunter this shit never fucking nothing ever happens in hunter hunter because the
02:15:50 guy is he doesn't draw it um fuck you but also um what's up but wait hey you know what i hey you
02:15:59 know what i love about one piece is that it'll finish one day is that it will ever be completed
02:16:03 that's so cool hunter hunter hunter hunter is finished it's over oh really finished a while
02:16:09 wait really it finished for me it's over for me like i like the the ending i wanted to happen
02:16:15 and i'm like all right well i'm good when like when literally the two main characters go their
02:16:21 separate ways that's where it ends and everything else is supplementary material for me got um
02:16:27 that being said the reason why i brought that up is because um like someone pointed out that like
02:16:32 out of all the out of all those mangakas who were still in support of raruni kenshin guy
02:16:37 after the whole fucking pito shit came out uh two names that didn't pop up were uh kiritori
02:16:43 yama and uh to with tagashi which is the guy from hunter hunter well that's nice and it's like all
02:16:48 right that's pretty cool oh good thank god it's the ones who are for a good what about um good ones
02:16:54 what about miura was he was he like i don't know i don't know when did this happen it was a couple
02:17:02 years ago so it might have been before he died it was back it was like it was a little bit before um
02:17:07 yeah it was a little bit after the whole thing happened and people were like mangakas were like
02:17:11 oh i stand with this guy i stand with the pito and it's unfortunate oh boy you know
02:17:17 fucking also saw someone say something like oh another reason why no one fucks with western
02:17:22 comics is because there's so much like sexual allegations among like people
02:17:31 buddy acting like oda wasn't defend didn't defend a pedophile twice he defended two different
02:17:35 pedophiles with the other the the um the torah dora guy no not torah dora um yeah tori tori kogai
02:17:42 yeah um yeah i don't know the details but i know that oda is kind of a little bit
02:17:49 yeah i don't know um it'd be like that i mean i guess i'm glad there's no allegations against
02:17:56 oda like that would be very very oda if you if you're doing any funny business please get exposed
02:18:03 after one day really yeah i i was in a i kind of had that thought like i remember um literally i
02:18:11 think the the second week of january when um andrew callaham got exposed as like a sex past
02:18:18 and there was all these allegations yeah i heard about that like a couple i i fucking he came to
02:18:25 my city like the month before because he was doing like a tour where he was like there it was like a
02:18:28 little show i didn't really hear like what he actually did it sounded like damn i wish i went
02:18:33 before he got it sounded like it wasn't really anything that that bad it sounded like he um he
02:18:39 was doing the he was really like coercing a lot of women to like give fine okay but to find i mean
02:18:47 what doing the whole thing where like where like you're kind of begging for them to just say yes to
02:18:52 give me sex and he apparently was doing this a lot a lot like cross country because he was that
02:19:00 yeah a lot of girls came out and said yeah because he would he would do the thing where he was literally
02:19:05 begging for them to consent and a lot of like girls have like evidence that they got dms of him
02:19:10 doing this and a lot of people around them and even open so you're saying he so you're saying he
02:19:16 asked for consent no not that he was okay there's like a difference between like oh do you want to
02:19:23 have sex and she says no and that's over right that's the end of but what he was doing was they
02:19:28 would say no but he would be like but please i really want he was basically doing the but i
02:19:33 really want to have sex with you i really do please say he was doing like his version of that
02:19:38 um sounds fine sounds fine actually sounds fine sounds i mean it's it's it's lame it sounds lame
02:19:47 sounds like most girls would say no but it doesn't sound like a bad thing to do
02:19:53 but then that's when they say no that's just sounds pathetic the end of it as then what
02:19:59 is is not okay for guys to do that it's not it's not okay to to ask for sex i don't i don't
02:20:07 understand no it's it's fine to ask but when they say like he they would say no and he would keep asking
02:20:14 so like after they say no okay so they just say no again or they can just stop answering no but
02:20:21 the problem is that they would even he would even ask again that's dumb that's like after the first
02:20:26 no no that's not that's not really that's i mean that it's annoying it might be annoying
02:20:33 oh man that's not that's not a good is it is this like in dms like and stuff it was in person it was
02:20:41 in dms he would do this in person it's bad it's in person it might be in person it might be bad if
02:20:47 you i mean it would yeah it could be i think you could you could you could do it in a way you could
02:20:53 do it in a way that is that is potentially uh coercive or or something yeah sure it i mean it
02:21:01 is coercion i mean it's like pathetic jeez what you're doing what you're doing okay look i don't
02:21:06 know i don't know the details what you're what you're just the the bare facts of what you're
02:21:09 describing to me are simply not coercion like asking repeatedly is not coercion there may there
02:21:15 might there might be detail there might be details that make it coercion on top of that
02:21:19 i i think that it was all in the effort to no not that i think i know it's like it was all
02:21:25 in the effort to ultimately get sex even though they said like no of course it was to get sex
02:21:30 yes i understand that he was asking for sex repeatedly how am i i i can't believe them
02:21:37 it's a totally i'm not saying it's cool or good i'm just saying like
02:21:43 i'm saying it's atrocious it's atrocious it's it's atrocious to ask
02:21:48 repeatedly for sex yeah after they said no it's the same person yeah it's don't do that that's
02:21:55 that's not good that's awful it's atrocious they already said no it's can't it's cancel worthy
02:22:02 yeah you don't do especially if you're doing this from state to state with like different women
02:22:06 who cares who oh oh he did it with different women oh he would what are you talking about
02:22:11 oh you definitely can't do it with different women what are you talking about
02:22:14 now i'm not saying he can't have sex i'm saying it's how you he's how he got the sex that's awful
02:22:20 that's like no that's not a good thing to do that i listen what stopped the women if they said no
02:22:28 and then he said but i really want to what stop them from simply saying no again or simply not
02:22:34 responding i mean okay listen we can't we can't we can't talk we i can't speak to like how he acted
02:22:39 in person there he could have acted in a way that was threatening or or or something like that's
02:22:44 possible but in dms if he says i want to have sex with him and she says no and then he sends a sense
02:22:49 of but he says but please can i though why did she why is it coercion then is she what stops her
02:22:56 from simply saying i said no or not answering it it's it's it doesn't look good on andrew if he
02:23:02 doesn't it doesn't look good but why what's what's what's i i mean i get that it's not cool
02:23:08 it's they say no that's that's it like in the like in person when they said no like that's
02:23:12 that's it but if you keep like asking for it says says who then it says who he says the women the
02:23:20 one accusing the women accusing him of asking multiple times why didn't if if you at what what
02:23:25 stop you don't seem to understand what i'm asking what stopped them from simply saying
02:23:31 no again or just not answering him you don't have to answer a text
02:23:36 there's there's i obviously i feel like there's because it's happened a couple months ago
02:23:41 there's probably details and i'm forgetting that like really like pain a better it will like a
02:23:46 worse well maybe there are well maybe there are ultimately i i remember at the time i the details
02:23:52 of it i remember being kind of maybe maybe if i read maybe if i read the text the details of it
02:23:58 would be would like yeah it would be bothersome coercion is like a specific thing right i mean
02:24:07 it's i mean there's different forms it can take it's not it's not just a yeah but like it's it's
02:24:13 like similar enough to blackmail like there's a reason they couldn't just say no or block him or
02:24:18 like if he was stalking them if he was harassing them like is it is it harassment there's like
02:24:23 there's a couple of i remember there was a couple other like details about this thing
02:24:28 all i all i know is that he got a lot of he got a pretty awful reputation and a lot of like like
02:24:34 seeing i mean if you i mean if you're if you're if you're whiny would label the guy as like someone
02:24:38 to like if you someone to like watch out if you're if you're whiny and annoying and you beg for sex
02:24:44 what's yeah what you're gonna get a reputation that like you're you're pathetic and like avoid
02:24:50 this guy uh uh and i mean i yeah i mean i'm just telling you that at the time when it came out
02:24:59 and people were like didn't like like like what he did sure he was dropped by the the freaking like
02:25:06 production company that he was a part of like he has like he has like no career now is that true
02:25:12 is that is that true yeah he has well well like i mean obviously he's probably just gonna take a
02:25:17 break and he's willing to come back i mean i would if maybe if i maybe i would read
02:25:21 maybe if i read all the details and i read all the dms i would be like
02:25:25 that's an unacceptable way to behave but i don't know the the sim the simple fact of asking repeatedly
02:25:35 for sex and she says no and then you ask again like just just does not strike me as like a
02:25:39 particularly offensive crime in and of itself really no not at all not at all well it's cringe
02:25:46 but like it doesn't it doesn't go into the in the realms of like criminality there's obviously
02:25:52 there's worse i know there's obviously worse crimes but i mean it's all it's it's it's it's
02:25:57 just annoying i don't even it's pretty awful actually it's it's it's it's merely it's merely
02:26:01 annoying i i don't even know if it's it was just i would say it's more than just annoying that he
02:26:08 like was doing this that he was like repeating i don't know i think your values for the same people
02:26:12 was what you know what it what if they say no they can they can't change their minds
02:26:19 you but like do you think like in the like say yeah you could change your mind but like i
02:26:27 i would assume change your mind like takes a minute you know if it's like in the same moment
02:26:32 he just it's like i don't know it's like it's like you think it's like you think that by asking
02:26:38 again he is somehow violating their consent well like it's like you're it's like you're not accepting
02:26:45 their no well i mean maybe but if they if if it's still okay but if it's still a no the if they
02:26:53 ask again and you said no the first time and it's still a no one no should be enough one one no
02:26:59 should be well maybe it well maybe it should be but i think it's all there's no there's nothing
02:27:06 there's nothing about there's nothing about asking again that has any any power to make your
02:27:11 no into a yes unless you want it to unless you want it to be you can you can ask again yeah
02:27:19 this fine but i think like later when like you know there's like like maybe later in a different
02:27:26 time but i don't think if you already said no to not having sex with someone i don't think you're
02:27:32 gonna change your mind like in the next two seconds well i don't like to lay down well i don't
02:27:38 like to lay down hard rules for social interaction like if if they say no then it's like it's it's
02:27:44 never it's it's never there's never any reason why you might ask again like shortly i mean maybe
02:27:51 there might be like you could ask again but i'm as a habit as a habitual thing i i think it sounds
02:28:00 it sounds annoying it sounds needy it sounds clingy it sounds desperate and and pathetic
02:28:07 but it doesn't it doesn't rise to the level of coercion unless there are other elements to it
02:28:15 all right i guess that's all i guess that's we've been we've been over this same loop of
02:28:20 couple of times now uh oh boy fuck you fuck you who boy fuck you who boy who boy ben that's a
02:28:30 cause spicy take don't ask don't don't say please if she says no don't say please afterwards
02:28:38 though if you ask someone for their nudes and then they say no and then like you're always say like
02:28:44 okay oh but please but i really but i really want them though but i really want them i mean
02:28:53 listen that's not what i would do i my strategy well i didn't want your dirty disgusting nudes
02:28:58 anyway they probably wouldn't even be flattering you probably can't even take a decent picture if
02:29:01 your life depended on it ugly and then she said fuck you i'll show i'll show you i'll oh okay the
02:29:10 the ben the ben saint strategy works every time works every time
02:29:15 and if it doesn't work the first time i just do it again immediately and it would always
02:29:19 works the second time there's no response that you say hey by the way um i won't like it if you
02:29:26 send nudes i would i say just letting you know that i would hate and then i look and there's no
02:29:30 response five minutes later i'm back to texting okay well you're really ugly and you're really
02:29:34 stupid and you have daddy issues and you have blue hair and communist and you're probably woke
02:29:40 and you probably read manga even though western comics are dying and it's all your fault you're
02:29:43 killing the industry uh and and i'll let you know how it goes i'm still i'm still going i'm still
02:29:50 going i'll let you know what the results are you you're tweeting out i've never seen a i've never
02:29:56 received a good never received a good man you tweet that out now that's a bit that's a banger
02:30:00 that's a banger tweet that yeah exactly uh i've never i've never seen i've never received a good
02:30:07 nude i've never received everyone who's ever sent me a nude reads that and is like i can't
02:30:12 fucking believe this i can't believe he would say that i can't believe this this atrocious man
02:30:19 would say i poured my heart and soul into those nudes only to be spurned publicly on twitter
02:30:30 what are we even all right what are we even talking about
02:30:34 we're talking about uh how popular my mega man video is and how it's doing big numbers it's
02:30:41 seven a third it's having a third a third wind it's great um yeah we're talking about the difficulty
02:30:47 of making it in the human race right sucks oh you know what's really tough my house got broken
02:30:55 into this week hell yeah i mean that sucks hell yeah or sorry i hear that or sorry that happened
02:31:01 to you i'm not gonna read all that yeah okay so we found a couple of times we found our door
02:31:10 like our back kitchen door just like hanging open and i guess we just assumed that like somebody
02:31:15 wasn't latching it properly and it was just getting blown open by the wind and then one time we found
02:31:20 it hanging open and there was a can of whippets on our couch do you know what whippets are nope yeah
02:31:29 it's a can of like some gas it's like pressurized gas that i think it's sold as a thing to like
02:31:34 clean your keyboard with but if you blow it up your nose and you inhale it it gets you high
02:31:39 and it's really bad for you it's a really harmful thing to do they used to be uh they used to be
02:31:44 legal yeah yeah i mean they're still sold as like aren't they they're sold as like some other
02:31:51 thing yeah but people have used them for like whippets yeah yeah but but there was a can of
02:31:57 that on our couch and no one else got there and our rice cooker the rice cooker that i cook my
02:32:02 lentils with bacon in is gone some fucking junkie wandered into our house did whippets on our couch
02:32:14 and stole my rice cooker and now i can't make my green lentils that's terrible do you think it was
02:32:22 maybe a giant rat yeah well it probably wasn't the regular rats it wasn't the regular rat if you will
02:32:31 the regular rats aren't that big no they didn't even take they didn't even take the whole thing
02:32:34 they didn't take the lid or the interior pot they just took the exterior like mechanism of the rice
02:32:41 cooker which is useless it's useless on its own but they just i i guess they just took it
02:32:47 and walked out and um yeah yeah some some our house got invaded check a local pawn shop they
02:32:56 probably pawned it off i wonder if there even are any local pawn shops there's probably a
02:33:02 bunch around here is it worth like calling the police and reporting stone i know i mean the
02:33:08 all police is gonna do is check local pawn shops if i even if they if they gave a shit that's
02:33:13 important i mean the right the rice cooker is literally worth 20 on amazon so it's not even
02:33:19 worth reporting a theft it's just unsettling that that happens you should set up a shotgun to go off
02:33:27 when the door opens we set up a um we set up a plan we set up c4 in the in the doorway we set up a
02:33:34 camera we set up someone someone set up a camera in the kitchen that i guess you can look at through
02:33:39 an app or something i'm not gonna look at it i don't care um but maybe someone if it happens again
02:33:45 maybe i'll check the footage uh fucking i don't know wish wish that didn't happen but i guess what
02:33:57 can you do well i wish i did not get robbed hot take i mean i wish i still had my rice cooker
02:34:04 i guess i gotta buy another one well then first they might have it then think about this think
02:34:10 about how if i go to the person is they've stolen your rice they were probably happy to steal most
02:34:15 of a rice cooker than i was to have that piece of the rice cooker imagine how happy they were from
02:34:21 the money they got from pining off your rice the eight dollars they probably got for it imagine
02:34:27 how much meth they got off with eight dollars dude like come on they're probably happier they
02:34:32 they know a bless you can never never feel imagine just like walking into somebody i mean we said
02:34:38 we all said okay we got to keep the door locked for now on uh i i like never locked the door
02:34:44 but i guess i guess i gotta start locking my door uh i wonder if there are any pawn shops near me
02:34:50 hang on let me let me find out maps google maps pawn shops
02:35:03 yeah there's um there's one there's one oh there you go boom start
02:35:12 uh yeah i mean i guess start of your um detective journey there's i mean there's one kind there's
02:35:20 one pretty close to me that i honestly could probably walk to in like half an hour and there's
02:35:25 a couple more like it more like in the city um i don't know it's not even worth it it's not even
02:35:33 it's not even worth it just fucking go just buy another one on amazon
02:35:39 so you get rows then there's like crackhead sees it as like oh in this house they keep respawning
02:35:45 there's a respawning rice cooker it's eight the eight dollars every single time
02:35:51 respawning rice cooker glitch found in ben's house
02:35:56 oh she put c4 in the next recipe cooker
02:36:03 you should coat it inside i there's there's there's there's just there's just nothing
02:36:10 wait a minute what remember how i did all that weird chemistry stuff to boil down all the the
02:36:17 quinine oh you can make you can make a crack and then attract the crackhead and then you kill them
02:36:23 what would actually be much more like easy way to do that would be if i if i use that rice cooker
02:36:29 the rice cooker is designed to cook off all the water and only leave and and stop cooking when
02:36:35 there's when the water is gone so that would actually be a really useful thing to like be
02:36:39 cooking down a solution hmm i didn't think about that oh just got another twitch follower
02:36:49 am i at am i at 16 am i at 1600 am i at 1600

02:37:41 and i would hate to see them i gained no bitches well let me read the comments comments on my on
02:37:49 my twitch announcement stream one black liquor ish two battle network is trash uh three fucking
02:37:59 dark void with another no jacky no watch i hate you i you know you're gonna say it in the comments
02:38:04 again you say that you i know you're you're in the comments of this video right now dark void
02:38:09 i hate you uh sweet this is gonna be great uh who cares who cares about people just genuinely
02:38:21 genuinely enjoying the content true all right that's enough
02:38:27 someone said someone said you will never get half a million views on your mega man video lol
02:38:35 but i'm yeah i saw that but i'm actually really i'm actually i i think it's a joke
02:38:40 i think it's like a joke like the meme of like the guy eating breakfast and then the second
02:38:44 panel he spits it out because he's proven wrong i i think it's it has to be a joke because i'm
02:38:48 obviously am going to hit a half a million if they're doing that joke the guy doesn't laugh he's
02:38:53 like dead pan when he says huh that'll never happen yeah you know you don't put a lull at the end
02:39:00 you fucked up yeah but yeah botch delivery i didn't quite get it but like that it can't he can't
02:39:06 genuinely think that i won't hit it like i certainly will i'm like i'm like less than 20 k i'm like 20
02:39:13 k away so i mean he doesn't know about the third wave he doesn't know that the third wind is hitting
02:39:19 right now so he might think that maybe it has stalled out not not the case is we might we've
02:39:26 got life we've got life left in these in these old bones yesterday was like a big day yesterday was
02:39:32 the i think i've got like eight or nine k views on that video just yesterday which is more than
02:39:37 i've gotten since like that's more views than in one day than i've gotten since the video was like
02:39:42 new although today does not look like it's quite as explosive someone was uh someone was talking
02:39:47 about you somewhere maybe was a gino you're talking about gino samuel um do you think that's why
02:39:55 i the views jump because everyone's like oh who's this ben saint character i mean the video
02:40:01 it i don't think so because it's just the mega man video that got the views like the other other
02:40:08 videos did not see a spike although it is weird that like yeah yesterday was like a had like was
02:40:14 like a spike within a spike and gino samuel release spike spike spike and gino samuel yeah
02:40:20 gino samuel release the new thing which goes into like the slime stuff which is very funny i wish
02:40:27 damn i wish i had i mean i it's better to release phantom's revenge after that is out and people
02:40:37 have heard about that but it would have been even better to have had the campaign running
02:40:42 when he made that video and announced it but oh well you know what can you do
02:40:50 what can you do what can you do nothing uh so many things can be planned out so much better
02:40:59 true right and you know every hindsight is 2020 2023
02:41:07 2020 12 when we all really died after this has been fake i want my green lentils
02:41:14 i want my green screen i want i want my rice cook cook are you mad man give it back motherfucker
02:41:21 i do i just want i just want my my green lentils and bacon uh hey have i told you have i mentioned
02:41:30 on the podcast that you can just put the bacon in the yes yes yes yes you have yes
02:41:36 you have yes you have yes you have yes you have yes you have yes you have yes you have
02:41:39 are you sure that i'm talking about that because it's like it's a pretty good trick it's a pretty
02:41:43 good trick you ever um you ever done a bacon wrapped rice balls before no but i did have uh
02:41:52 someone cook uh it was they made spam they fried spam in sesame oil and they put that on like the
02:41:59 bottom of a rice ball almost like like a sashimi that was really good
02:42:03 that was held i've had i've made bacon wrapped Brussels sprouts that's really good that's a
02:42:11 way i did um i did my second attempt at orange chicken a couple nights ago it was uh probably my
02:42:17 best so far but i said i've not perfected it sounds that sounds tough yeah because i'm
02:42:23 well kind of fucked me up is making the homemade sauce i uh i i took the baby way out and i bought
02:42:29 a bottle of like the pan to express orange chicken sauce and um all i did what it is like
02:42:36 after i like fried the chicken a little bit i like eat it up some of the sauce on a pan and i
02:42:41 put the chicken on it and i coated in it and um it tastes it tastes good but it could always be
02:42:47 better is it crispy yeah it was crispy um let me um oh hey i won't have one last thing
02:42:58 that i want to mention this week this is really funny i was asking i was asking chat gpt some
02:43:04 stuff actually the reason i started uh the the first thing i asked chat gpt was i i asked it
02:43:13 whether making the blue rays was ethical that was the first quest set of question i asked yeah
02:43:18 it said what did they say it did it said no it's but here's the thing here's the thing
02:43:25 i i explained the situation to it and i asked it like can like it did it said no
02:43:33 uh it sort of said like yes i acknowledged that like yes these are problems like yes the
02:43:39 artist should have delivered on their work however you know it's you know it's not it's not uh
02:43:44 one must be careful of like ethical the legal the it said it wasn't ethical and it wasn't legal
02:43:50 i think it was just really hung up on the fact that like i think it was just really hung up on
02:43:54 the fact that like it's technically copyright infringement and therefore it's like it's illegal
02:43:59 i think i think it's just a fucking narc and it's just obsessed with rules and it'll end
02:44:03 it only and it only knows how to operate by like there's no there's no room for lateral thinking
02:44:08 and there's no room for like oh but like what about what about what about uh what's the word um uh uh
02:44:16 extenuating circumstances it just it just wasn't thinking like that so yeah it said no
02:44:20 but like fuck jet gpt it's a narc uh but anyway after that i asked it about the pcp
02:44:27 and i think gibby probably saw my post i i asked it about like who what is the procrastinators
02:44:33 podcast and then i asked it who are the members of the procrastinators podcast and um here i'll
02:44:41 i'll show the screenshot and it listed these are the members of the pro procrastinators
02:44:46 podcast right here they were um digibro the best guy ever endless jess devour
02:44:55 hippo hippo crit monkey jones ben saint munchie tom oliver mage nate talks to you
02:45:04 trixie glink and radcon collective consisting of various members who attended the radcon conventions
02:45:13 um which i guess would include um zen huckstable and uh zen huckstable and uh jeff
02:45:23 yeah jeff's name jeff foo no no um i forgot jeff yeah i forgot jeff foo jeff burges jeff
02:45:31 rest yes yes yes there's the musician yeah yeah yeah i remember yeah yo yeah yo yeah yo um
02:45:38 and uh uh there was more there was more and it was really good and shade shade shade and victor
02:45:47 shade and victor shades girlfriend right who i forget right whatever her name was um yeah okay
02:45:54 they've all appeared in a radcon so then i so then i asked it uh so gib you didn't see these
02:46:01 i saw that i like um nate talks to you i think i asked it i asked it about nate it thinks that
02:46:08 natan best guy ever nate talks to you and best guy ever two different guys and it thinks that best
02:46:12 guy ever is this like german soccer player named jonathan berghardt oh yeah so so i asked it who
02:46:20 ben saint is and it said that i won't read this whole thing but it said ben saint is an animator
02:46:25 and the creator of the animated series munchie minute and then i asked and then i asked it tell
02:46:32 me about some episodes of the munchie minute and uh it said oh yeah munchie minute is a series of
02:46:38 short comedic animated sketches episodes include crash bandicoot breaks the law ben shepiro destroys
02:46:45 the snowman egg boys and nuclear fusion dance i asked it for some more but the next set wasn't as good
02:46:54 um my favorite here is jupiro destroys the snowman in which ben shepiro attempts to use logic and
02:47:02 reason to destroy snowman and then um so i and it ends in ends in a in a in a comedic twist ending
02:47:11 so then i asked it explain the comedic twist ending of uh of ben shepiro destroys the snowman
02:47:18 and the plot of ben shepiro destroys the snowman is he attempts to use logic and reason to prove
02:47:22 that the snowman does not have rights and then the comedic twist ending is that it turns out
02:47:27 it was all happening inside a snow globe which is very very funny and good and cool i i wonder why
02:47:36 i am imagining the reason is like they came up with ben shepiro destroys the snowman is because
02:47:41 of like special snowflakes maybe you're just a you're just a big collection of snowflakes maybe
02:47:48 sort of possibly villain ben shepiro i don't know it's hard to say um i i asked it so i mean i i love
02:47:55 this i pardon pardon me want pardon me wants to yeah pardon me wants to make like munchy minute
02:48:01 episode one ben shepiro destroys the snowman just because of this prompt um but um i i asked it about
02:48:10 who is munchy and it said munchy is not a person he is only like the the munchy and munchy minute
02:48:17 simply refers to the food related themes that are often prevalent in the munchy minute
02:48:21 also munchy is the co-creator of the munchy minute and he is an important person involved in like the
02:48:26 in the in the creation of the series it's like okay but he's also the co-creator he's not a real
02:48:33 person but he's also the co-creator of the series and then i asked it that the fourth episode called
02:48:38 nuclear fusion dance it got i asked it about the plot of nuclear fusion dance and it got really
02:48:43 it basically said okay in nuclear fusion dance two characters like kyle and trevor try to do the
02:48:49 dragon ball z fusion dance and they fuse but it doesn't go right yeah it leads to unexpected
02:48:54 consequences so i asked it okay what are the unexpected consequences and it said that they
02:49:00 merged together into like a big like disgusting flesh monster and then they rampaged through the
02:49:04 town uh but then they worked together to defeat it and i'm like wait a second so i asked it like
02:49:10 with chat gpt what do you mean they work together to defeat it aren't they the monster because they
02:49:15 fuse together into it and it's like yes sorry for any any any confusion they fuse together into the
02:49:21 monster and then they have to work together kyle uses his his intelligence to strategize
02:49:28 while trevor uses his physical prowess to perform martial arts maneuvers against the monster
02:49:32 and thus they defeat they defeat the monster and i'm like no chat gpt hang aren't they fused
02:49:38 together into the monster and it's like sorry sorry for the confusion they have to work together to
02:49:45 perform strategic maneuvers to get the monster to defuse so that then they can defeat it and i said
02:49:51 what do you mean what strategic maneuvers do they do and they said sorry sorry for the confusion um
02:49:58 yeah you see they they they they they strategy they have to get they have to perform the fusion
02:50:02 dance again and that makes the monster defuse so that they can fight how do they perform the
02:50:08 fusion dance again if they're fused into the monster instead sorry sorry they had to desync
02:50:13 they had to desync their behavior so much that the fusion came apart and then once they were taken
02:50:21 apart then they could do the fusion dance and that caused the monster to defuse and so that they
02:50:26 could defeat it and like okay okay and that i gave up at that point i'm like it doesn't understand
02:50:32 the concept of the fusion dance um but that i thought that was pretty great uh i had a very
02:50:40 had a very uh uh very laughs aplenty laughs aplenty from chat gpt um there was a chat gpt episode
02:50:49 of south park actually was the last one really yeah and it was pretty funny because the the joke was
02:50:55 that um uh stan's girlfriend wendy did not um she didn't like that stan wouldn't really like
02:51:04 dm her back or talk talk to her like she would send him a message and all he would do would
02:51:09 like reply with a thumbs up emoji tell her messages right and because that wendy was like
02:51:16 was threatening stan that she was gonna break up with him and stan hears the rumors that um
02:51:21 he wants his name i forget the name of the other there's another kid who who probably he's
02:51:27 not kyle um token now i think it's heart right craig maybe okay uh maybe oh no it's not craig
02:51:36 because craig is like i forget the other name of the there's like another kid who's kind of like
02:51:41 who's considered popular ken among the boys okay that being said this kid like apparently he's
02:51:47 always gives the best messages ever to his girlfriend and stan asks him like what's your
02:51:52 secret man and he's all like chat gpt so basically what he does is that he like gets chat gpt to come
02:51:59 up with replies for the stuff his girlfriend sends him he just copy and paste what the replies are
02:52:04 back to his girlfriend and his girlfriend eats it up his girlfriend thinks it's really him so stan
02:52:09 started doing that to wendy so every time wendy sends him a dms he just like copies and replies
02:52:15 and like gets chat bt to like come over reply then he copy and paste it back into
02:52:21 oh god i bet i bet i bet guys are like i bet guys are making like chat gpt write me like a good
02:52:29 opener to like send to this girl that i matched with on twitter on tinder i mean i mean maybe twitter
02:52:34 too i bet people are doing that i wonder i wonder like what it i'm gonna ask it right now i'm gonna
02:52:41 ask you right now and say uh chat gpt what's the best opener for this girl to make sure she
02:52:46 sent me her nudes make sure make sure what's the best opener to make sure she does not send me
02:52:52 nudes that's what i want i wanted to be interested but i do not want the news how do i how do i make
02:52:57 this happen all jabby chat gpt would say like hey bitch fuck hey negam just just negam just negam
02:53:06 uh she definitely won't fucking send you nudes and she definitely will not if you listen if you if
02:53:14 no nudes is your goal i have the solution for you um i know the guy i know a guy i know i know a guy
02:53:23 who can get you absolutely zero news for free his name is ben sake
02:53:32 oh you don't want you don't want nudes i don't just the guy
02:53:39 anyway the episode the episode of south park ends with um like so apparently um like kids are also
02:53:49 using the chat gpt to come up with like essays for a class you know for you know so they don't have
02:53:55 to do homework and um one of the one of the like supervising teachers realizes that um oh that's
02:54:02 not good so there's a guy that they hire who could check to see if any of any of the essays are written
02:54:08 by ai and the guy that they that shows up is like a like looks like a weird shaman guy who lives in
02:54:14 the woods and he has like a pet hawk like he's like anti technology and he um and he basically
02:54:20 uses his little shaman stick because he could detect like who's using ai with his shaman stick
02:54:26 and apparently they pinpoint it to stan's girlfriend because she has a bunch of ai messages
02:54:32 in her dms and this is what this this guy is like finding and stan is like oh no if um she finds out
02:54:38 about the ai messages i'm fucked i'm gonna break out with me but then stan comes up with a brilliant
02:54:43 idea he goes back to chat gpt and he says um chat gpt tell me a story about a guy named stan who's
02:54:52 been using chat gpt messages to like light his girlfriend and the story has to end with him
02:54:57 still being with his girlfriend and not having to tell her the truth about it and um and and then
02:55:04 and then the the last like the last like three minutes of the episode is literally like a script
02:55:10 that chat gpt wrote for the ending of that episode where stan still ends up with his girlfriend even
02:55:15 though he he comes out with the truth about the ai and then when the episode ends it says episode
02:55:21 written by trey parker and chat gpt chat gpt that's funny yeah that's funny okay so i asked chat gpt
02:55:28 i asked chat gpt to write me a good opening line to send to a girl i matched with on tinder but
02:55:32 write it so she won't send me any nudes chat gpt says sure here's a friendly and respectful
02:55:38 opening line that should avoid any unwanted requests for nudes hey there i couldn't help but
02:55:43 notice we share a love for insert common interest from her bio or photos would you be interested
02:55:48 in grabbing a coffee or drink sometime and chatting more about it and i said no i want to make sure
02:55:53 she won't send me nudes and chat gpt said my apologies for misunderstanding your request
02:55:58 earlier here's a suggestion for an opening line that conveys your intention and sets a clear
02:56:02 boundary while still being respectful hey i'm really enjoying chatting with you so far but
02:56:07 just wanted to make it clear that i'm not interested in receiving any explicit photos hope that's okay
02:56:13 with you i'm just gonna drop that in a casual conversation the conversation's going well we're
02:56:20 hitting it off yeah we're thinking of maybe a first date hey i'm really enjoying chatting with you
02:56:24 but i just want to make it clear i'm not interested in receiving any explicit photos i hope that's
02:56:28 okay with you you know i wonder okay i wonder i wonder if that would actually pique interest
02:56:34 because it's like hey this guy is telling me not to send him nudes he must he must get too many
02:56:41 nudes he must be so drowning and pussy that he simply gets too many nudes all the time and he's
02:56:46 sick of them this must be a high value alpha male and he doesn't want to see my nudes because
02:56:51 he doesn't want to see my nudes exactly what they'll say knows that they're not good enough
02:56:54 because i'm not good enough for him but but i will prove him wrong this is the this is the
02:57:02 concept this is why i say all right cheesy you're gonna hate this you're gonna hate this
02:57:07 the the the pick up the pickup artist community is unfairly maligned because oh okay some of the
02:57:15 norm because okay there's really bad guys there's really bad guys that pedal really bad stuff in
02:57:19 there but if you read just like bad guys on both sides but if there's bad guys on both sides but
02:57:23 if you read the normal books about it if you read like the mainstream most popular books about it
02:57:28 the stuff they tell you to do is actually really normal and one of the and one of the things that
02:57:34 people don't like is the idea of a neg which is like which people think that negging a girl means
02:57:39 insulting her and if you read the books if you read like like the the big book or the art of the game
02:57:45 or whatever it's called it makes it very clear that no a neg is not just an insulting a girl
02:57:50 it's just something that you do or say that simply makes it clear to her that you are not overly
02:57:56 interested in her and something and an example that it gives is like blowing your nose just to
02:58:01 make it like you you you you're not you don't care if she sees you blowing your nose you're not like
02:58:06 hung up on she's like oh we gotta make a really good impression because i'm so invested in in this
02:58:10 interaction right so this is a perfect neg perfect neg hey i'm really enjoying chatting with jafar
02:58:16 just wanted to make it clear that i'm not interested in receiving any explicit photos
02:58:19 hope that's okay with you that tells her that i have that i'm a high value male that tells her
02:58:24 that she's not good enough for me that's gonna get the juices flowing she's gonna she's gonna soak
02:58:29 her panties soaked and dropped it's over it's over thank you gbt you've changed everything for me
02:58:39 that's like going there and dm saying like hey girl just letting you know i'm not gonna look at
02:58:42 your cleavage do not the lowest cut shirt ever i'm not gonna say one peak i like to you're gonna
02:58:48 wear you have boobs or not let's just let let let's explore this what if i what if i jump into the
02:58:52 dm's and i open with a hey girl put a freaking shirt on don't let me see that don't let me see that

02:59:25 i ugly ugly ugly ugly ugly ugly i have this this awful joke but i can't say it because it's
02:59:35 dangerously close to a slayer it's it's probably the most dangerously close i get they go to the
02:59:42 to the end serve i'm like oh you're a real neg and then say they are yeah i'm neggin i'm a negger
02:59:52 i tell girls the truth which is that they're ugly and it's normal and it's normal it's
02:59:58 etymologically unrelated to any to any to any ethnic slayers that you might be thinking of
03:00:06 this let's let's let's let's be mature let's be mature here okay let's be adults let's be adults
03:00:11 all right all right grow up cheesy cheesy grow up cheesy grow up let's grow up and say it say

03:00:23 i'm good i'm i'm oh my god but the episode bed bed goes cheesy to say the end i don't know
03:00:31 i don't know what you're talking about i don't know what you're talking about all right uh
03:00:37 that was my last thing on my list the munchie minute i just wanted to remind everyone about the
03:00:41 munchie minute created by animator ben saint and co-created by munchie who does not exist
03:00:49 featuring fan favorite episode ben Shapiro destroys the snowman then the moment you're not a pcp
03:00:55 member you might as well not exist really it's kind of like the logic of chat yeah i mean that's
03:01:02 true that's true for most of our listeners as well yeah exactly munchie stop listening you ain't
03:01:08 real no more yeah i'm just a voice in your computer saying saying the n-word but not really though
03:01:17 but not really though but i really didn't actually i didn't actually say it though i didn't actually
03:01:22 he didn't say it guys he did not say and she's he's not even white so if he says i didn't say
03:01:30 thank you for being like gave me the thank you for being my shield the poc pat thank you for
03:01:33 being my shield thank you for being my shield the poc pat on the back thank you
03:01:44 anything else what else what else we're doing what else what else is going on
03:01:48 dudes uh i'm playing kids i'm playing more out of wilds again that's fun
03:01:56 yeah you were you were damning me about that cheesy have you played out of wilds
03:02:00 i've heard about it you know you know what it's about you're in space and stuff it is about space
03:02:06 and stuff and gravity of the little orbital the planets do gravity on you in a realistic
03:02:13 enough fashion they sure do they really do be doing gravity though it's really fun it's really
03:02:20 fun just flying out somewhere and being like oh shit i'm in an i'm in like a collision course
03:02:25 with the sun and that's no good and then you die i actually got really one of the most frustrating
03:02:31 parts was like just just when you would be like you would die and then be like oh i got to get
03:02:36 back to wherever i was going and then just the way it worked out getting back there meant going
03:02:41 around the sun but you would like try cut it too close and you'd fall in that happened like so many
03:02:46 so many times but it's on me it's on me for not planning my route more carefully there's this
03:02:52 one thing i tried i tried not putting my spacesuit on because some planets have oxygen um and i can't
03:03:01 remember what i did i got on my ship and then i flew to somewhere where did i fly oh doesn't it
03:03:10 doesn't the deep doesn't the giants deep have oxygen it does but only on the islands if you're
03:03:15 in the water you instantly drown which is funny right not instantly um well it's funny how like
03:03:22 yeah you you're in the water presumably you still have an oxygen supply when you're under the water
03:03:29 not if you don't have your suit on that's what i mean oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but i can't
03:03:34 talk about what i was going to talk about because this contains too many spoilers
03:03:38 um now i got you nice but there was a cool thing i did and then i died and it was funny
03:03:46 also the echoes of the idlc i finally i'm finally looking into that because the version i played
03:03:51 before was on like xbox live like whatever and it didn't have the dlc and i finished that that xbox
03:04:00 live um like month that i got for free and then i bought the game on steam and it had the dlc
03:04:06 you know i'm trying that and it's very scary very scary and i'm scared it seems a little scary
03:04:13 i'm not i don't think i'm into it i'm a little too scared i am a little too i am a little too
03:04:19 scared and also it doesn't really involve much like space stuff which is kind of disappointing
03:04:25 which is the real scary part it's that's the i i appreciate that they tried to do a different
03:04:31 kind of stuff of stuff in their engine i just it's kind of not what appealed to me about the
03:04:36 core game so i've sort of like found it a little disappointing that that's what they did with it
03:04:41 i mean what i'm enjoying so far is just that it's a new a different set of mysteries to solve
03:04:50 like i don't know nothing about all this this extra i don't like how scary it is i don't like
03:04:57 how scary it is i haven't actually got to a jump scare yet i'm just exploring but when i got there
03:05:02 for the first time the thing is like they have in the menu by the way the echoes of the iadlc
03:05:08 may be maybe too much for some uh gamers go into the options and turn down the scary factor and
03:05:15 i'm like don't tell me about that don't you've already ruined it now yeah yeah yeah it did
03:05:20 yeah it terrified me i bet it's not even that bad but that made me so i was so nervous about it
03:05:27 because it felt the need to warn me that i'm like i don't even want to i don't even want to do it
03:05:31 i don't even want to see it i'm i'm going in though i'm gonna go in i'm gonna pee my pants
03:05:35 i'm gonna scream and then i'm gonna go to the menu i'm gonna turn down the stairs
03:05:39 but i'm not gonna do them down yet i want to see what it what it you're going in p mode you're
03:05:43 going in p mode first first thing right off the bat oh congratulations hey hey gamer are you a little
03:05:49 baby bitch too scared of a little video game yes the baby mode in this i know i am baby i mean
03:05:56 there's parts of the main game that are so scary that i hate them oh yeah yeah yeah even the main
03:06:03 game has some what you might consider jump scares yeah they are so bad and i am so scared and but
03:06:11 it's like best game ever but it's it is the best game ever it's so scary the bramble is really like
03:06:17 it's rough it's really rough going in the bramble um sometimes i literally have to like
03:06:23 just close my eyes when i know something is gonna kill me i in outer wiles is like this is not going
03:06:28 to work out fuck it i'll uh close my eyes then i eventually kind of just got sort of like used
03:06:37 to what happens in the bramble that it's sort of just i got numb to it uh although if i probably
03:06:43 booted up again it's been long enough that i probably would have to re re but i just but i just kept
03:06:49 hey re but i just kept happening over and over again so many times that finally it lost it lost
03:06:54 its sting a little bit but never completely it's still like really you hate you hate it every
03:06:59 single time and another thing i've been playing recently is subnautica i've gone back into that
03:07:07 and that is similarly the scariest game ever but it's yeah for similar probably for similar reasons
03:07:12 yeah i played subnautica before i played out played outer worlds and subnautica is like you're in the
03:07:18 ocean and you're trying to survive and there are lots of very good sound design scary scary
03:07:26 sounds of big huge leviathan beasts far off in the distance that you can't see because the ocean is
03:07:31 like blurry and you feel like you're gonna get eaten at any point moment all the time yeah i the idea
03:07:38 of like being floating in like water and like you look down and down below you is just like
03:07:45 void and like something might come up out of it is like the scariest thing yeah i like i i'm i'm
03:07:51 like in the shallow areas i don't know if i could handle subnautica at the beginning you're in you
03:07:56 usually land in an area near in the same sort of place every time you play and it's like a
03:08:03 shallowish area with coral reefs and stuff and you can explore caves there but then you go out
03:08:08 a little bit and then there's this big long trench this huge and you have to go like a hundred meters
03:08:14 down i think and it's like if i were oh i think if i were floating above some kind of underwater
03:08:21 chasm and i would be so scared to look down and then if i did look down and if something was like
03:08:32 coming at me i think i it would be over it would be over if i look down and there was something
03:08:38 there with its mouth open that would just be over for me oh yeah if i looked down to the void
03:08:43 and i saw if i saw like a nude slowly come down yeah i would lose it if i looked into the void
03:08:50 void void void void void void these fish aren't wearing any clothes this is not like
03:09:00 this leviathan is is indecent uh but yeah um subnautica ocean uh when i played out a world
03:09:10 to the first time and i got to giant steep giant steep is a little bit scary but it's not really
03:09:15 that bad i thought i was gonna i thought i was gonna be way more scared of like the ocean in the
03:09:19 giant steam i was like turned the game off like paralyzed by giant steep the first time i came
03:09:24 there because i i landed in the ocean because it's mostly an ocean planet yeah and i saw some
03:09:30 stuff below me and i was like i know what subnautica is like i am going to be eaten by a giant fish
03:09:36 immediately i'm so scared i had to pause i had to leave my room i i when i got to giant steep i was
03:09:44 i think the first couple times maybe the first time i just swam around the surface and i was just
03:09:48 like i'm not looking down i'm not looking down i'm not looking down uh i think the second time i
03:09:53 got there i was like god damn it i gotta do it and i just like didn't even think about it i just
03:09:58 like pushed my mouth i was like go just look down just dive just go go and i looked down and you
03:10:02 know what's actually there is not especially unsettling so i was like okay it's fine now it's
03:10:07 fine i it's it's the similar to two things it's like the exploration the unknown it's the fear of
03:10:13 the unknown and the amazing sound design on both those games that really if as long as you as long
03:10:18 as you have it as like max volume like normal like if you if you put it down really low sound
03:10:24 when it's like barely there it affects you so much less yeah but um i like i like the immersion
03:10:31 that it brings because it's like that's that's what i want i want to i want to i want to conquer
03:10:38 this fear of the unknown of the ocean of space you're not playing you're not playing it in vr
03:10:43 you're not playing in vr are you i do not have a vr set so i couldn't but i would never do that
03:10:52 that would be in sub nautica especially yeah that's the sort of thing because i oh my god
03:10:59 i don't play with headphones when i play with headphones it's so much scarier yeah i can only
03:11:04 i can only the surround sound and it's like you hear like a little you hear like the the big
03:11:10 booming like growls of certain fish and you know those growls are kind of like those of her before
03:11:16 is okay those ones are okay but then you hear a different one and it's very close and you're like
03:11:20 what i don't know this and you just you're you're you're put upon you're put upon by by fear
03:11:28 put upon put upon put upon put upon put upon put upon um yeah now that's what my heart's doing
03:11:34 i uh it makes ooo love the leviathans of the deep make my kokoro go doki doki
03:11:44 doki doki in a in a uh korae way or what do they say uh is that korae
03:11:52 i know sugoi koi is scary koi yeah it's not kawaii it's koi koi yeah kawaii yeah
03:12:02 japan japan yeah japan they done it again they make the best comics and more of them too
03:12:10 the western market will never survive well good we're all gonna die we're all gonna die
03:12:18 you know i um so i tuned into nate's talking pirate stream for a little bit uh the other day
03:12:26 i was i was i was shocked i was shocked by what i heard what did he say
03:12:34 i don't i don't are you talking about the the the sound board
03:12:39 i was shocked by what i was hearing and maybe it's like a bit that i don't get
03:12:44 the guy does not seem to like one piece like what may yeah ever it seems like the attitude
03:12:52 in there is like one piece is just is bad i mean that's how it's always it always was on like
03:12:58 uh the podcast nate would be super cynical and be hyper focused on anything he could find that was
03:13:06 slightly like potentially incorrect yeah yeah or like that's what it was how dare this you know
03:13:14 like he's he's ready and willing and able to shit all over one piece the second it like
03:13:20 deviates from pre-established canon or implies something that he doesn't like
03:13:26 yeah and it's like i don't know like i guess he likes it and that's just how he likes it
03:13:31 it doesn't i mean it doesn't my i mean i came away from that stream being like i think i think he
03:13:37 i don't even think he likes one piece i'm over here like one piece is literally the best it's
03:13:43 ever been and he's reading it and it's like i don't i don't know if it's a bit it seems almost
03:13:49 like a bit but he's just like oh the art all the art so the line are so sketchy oh bad uh oh does a
03:13:56 hack uh uh oh this this jinbei is like oh these these the the the freaking seraphim are too strong
03:14:03 broken op oh uh uh oh does a hack uh sanji's eyebrow was swirling the wrong way and like this implies
03:14:11 some weird shit about uh the the germa's thing the thing uh oh does a hack oh he broke his own rules
03:14:18 again uh huh oh but he said it but he said it was like this in the sbs but now it's like this in
03:14:24 this panel but only for one panel and it goes back why doesn't why doesn't odi give a fuck about
03:14:30 about his own work anymore this is why it's it's a very doomery like approach yeah i like he he
03:14:40 sees like the inevitable demise of his favorite thing and he can't help but bring it into the
03:14:46 like he's all the time it's like he sees it in every panel it's like he sees every page is like
03:14:51 here's the the decline continues and there it is uh i knew this would happen he says reading the
03:15:00 best fucking chapter one piece ever had i knew this was gonna happen i knew this would happen as
03:15:05 well i've been dreading i've been dreading this day i i didn't get it i didn't get it that was always
03:15:11 the thing is that i would be the optimist and they would be the cynic we would balance each other
03:15:17 out i guess people i think liked it you know what's better if you just have two people on one side
03:15:23 of the seesaw that's why we're such a good team give because we both just love one piece we both
03:15:30 just uncritically love one piece and we'll just shovel down whatever slop oda puts on our on our
03:15:35 bowl suck it down and say thank you yep you see oda he he he makes his see he makes his chapters
03:15:46 of one piece bad on purpose right he makes them bad on purpose and the reader says no but any the
03:15:52 reader says no i don't like this but then oda says please like my shitty one piece i made it bad on
03:15:57 purpose but but please would you read it and continue to buy my comics and they go oh i guess
03:16:02 i have to i guess i have to keep buying it even though it's bad now because he's because he asked
03:16:07 me again um that's why he loves his pedophile friends so much they just have no they just don't
03:16:15 believe in consent are you referencing something no i feel like you're referencing something here
03:16:21 wrong i'm referencing reality yeah referencing the real life cheesy if you have if you don't know
03:16:28 we love y'all living it yeah i'm referencing um torico our twisted world our twisted my dark
03:16:36 twisted mind i'm maybe like i don't know you ever consider that maybe like nate has good taste
03:16:42 and you have bad taste that could just be it you know that that could be could be the real answer
03:16:48 here having the best taste means being the most miserable person on the planet and i don't want
03:16:53 that i myself i don't know if that's true i i don't know i think i'm gonna want you to be miserable
03:16:59 that was the intention with this chapter and you're i know i'm enjoying instead yeah i'm
03:17:06 i'm definitely authoring it i i found i found fishman island and the wano arcs a little bit
03:17:12 tedious like i definitely did not have no complaints about those chapters but egghead i like
03:17:19 unless it's unless it goes on and on like i have like basically no problems with it at all and i
03:17:25 think it's great and it's so cool to see all these like threads that are so old they were established
03:17:29 so long ago and they're coming together right before our eyes and like it's really happening and it
03:17:34 feels great and i just and i just don't fucking understand i just don't fucking understand the
03:17:42 mindset on display over there where it's like what was he uh yeah sanji's eyebrow swirl being
03:17:49 inconsistent uh fuck yeah what else was there the like like the the line line art is sketchy uh i
03:17:57 don't even remember there were there were like one or two other things jinbei's some like something
03:18:04 about like the the specific verbiage that shanji used to insult the lunarian jinbei i don't even
03:18:11 remember but like there's just so i don't see i don't see any cause for negativity at all i don't
03:18:19 see any i don't see call right thank you thank you uh i don't see any cause for negativity at all and
03:18:25 i was like i was watching and i was just like what what what where's this coming from it genuinely
03:18:33 like took me back like how could you i just don't see how you can be negative about one piece in
03:18:39 march of 2023 but that i don't know and that's why i'm like am i just am i just not in on the joke
03:18:47 i i don't know if it's a joke i think it's just the there's a there's a sense that
03:18:55 like your favorite thing could get worse it seems like it's a fear of a lot of media
03:19:02 enjoyers that their favorite thing could get worse and they're so scared that it's gonna happen
03:19:06 what if it goes woke now it's whatever whatever does this or that it seems like it just doesn't
03:19:11 look like anything particularly bad is happening but they're just so ready to be it's not just
03:19:15 nate it's like a whole community of like like uh what's the word um negative nancies uh they're
03:19:24 nate uh they're not negative nate heads negative nate heads it just it just seems like he's already
03:19:30 accepted that it will get bad and in fact it already has so if it is a why continue why continue
03:19:38 this charade any longer there's there's like if you've decided that there's points where there's
03:19:43 like an argument that this is worse than it was sure but i just generally i listen to those
03:19:49 and i'm like sure i can see why you would think that but i don't mind it and it's fact it's fine
03:19:54 actually there's a few there's a few nate nate is nate is still bothered by nika i'm like i don't
03:20:00 care i don't care about nika yeah it's fine cool the fruit wasn't the gum gum fruit cool okay
03:20:06 i guess we got nika now gear five sure like it's it's it's it's one of those things it's like um
03:20:13 would it like hypothetically i guess it would have been better if that had been planned from
03:20:20 the very beginning and been and been sprinkled like little hints towards it so that people could
03:20:26 come up with theories and and and then the theory would be true sure and then it feels like some
03:20:31 things that you they they were sort of made up more recently sure biota um and i think that is
03:20:39 like you know hypothetically would have been nicer if it was all perfectly planned but like real life
03:20:44 it's hard to it's hard to plan out like 900 chapters of a manga series it's hard to like
03:20:50 perfectly plan out everything yeah and i think that a little leeway is fine yeah it doesn't
03:20:56 break anything it's just you couldn't have seen it coming yeah oh jeez you said i like responded
03:21:04 to you on twitter because you said like one piece botches it's like it's like power reveals oh yeah
03:21:08 and i said give me an example and you gave me a couple of good examples i was like oh yeah that's
03:21:12 true okay that i did i did nancy one piece is not perfect but like it's so good i like that
03:21:19 so much of the good outweighs like all of the bad and there's a reason it's like the most popular
03:21:25 thing ever and that it's still going and still quality it's just maybe there's a few things that
03:21:31 pet peeves and things that make you sad a little bit i just i i doesn't affect me so much i don't
03:21:38 know why i know that um online i'm known as the number one one piece hater on uh twitter.com if one
03:21:45 piece has one hater it's me if one piece has no haters your cheesy's dead yeah yeah yeah but even
03:21:53 but even i cheesy manfredo i have to admit that um i i feel like what i always kind of liked about
03:22:00 one piece and why i'm i'm still i'm still like you know right there in the hot seat would it
03:22:05 are you are you current are you up to date on it no but i promise that the next time i come back
03:22:10 on this on this podcast i'll be up to date that's fine i actually i didn't read this week's chapter
03:22:16 again lol uh but um i think the one thing i really like about one piece is the the fact that oda will
03:22:23 like give you 50 things at the same time and like one or five of those things might not be the best
03:22:31 ever but like a lot of it is good a lot of it is like still good right he's really good at just
03:22:37 throwing things at you that are like entertaining that are interesting that are cool that are funny
03:22:42 that are base that are redpilled you know you'll still throw you all this like really good stuff so
03:22:46 like the fact that it just you can only think of like negative things it's like i don't know you
03:22:51 you might be like really like like reaching you know um one problem that i had and it's kind of
03:22:58 why i like kind of stopped reading at the at towards like the middle of the kaito fight um and
03:23:04 i mean i'll catch up whatever but i think one thing that kind of really bothered me is that um it
03:23:10 is kind of this problem that one piece figured out at the start but then they kind of just
03:23:16 went back into having this problem and it's like um i always like that one piece solved the the
03:23:23 waiting for Goku problem you know and the whole thing about like waiting for Goku is that they
03:23:31 in Dragon Ball they usually how it ends up is they usually wait for Goku to show up so all the
03:23:37 other side characters are getting their ass kicked buying Goku time right and i think one piece did
03:23:43 such a good job of solving that issue and what they did is that like there isn't just one bad guy
03:23:49 it's a crew of bad guys and we have a crew of good guys so while Luffy is fighting the the big top
03:23:56 dog all the other crew members are fighting their own individual battles right and yeah and it's kind
03:24:03 of like like like if Oda wrote if Oda wrote like the Namek uh the the the Namek arc in Dragon Ball Z
03:24:11 he would have had it that uh Goku would have been fighting Frieza at the same time all the side
03:24:17 characters would have been fighting the Ginyu force so he would have had those fights be
03:24:20 happening simultaneously while the planet is blowing up like that would have that's how Oda
03:24:24 would have wrote in that written that arc right but then and they did this they did so well but
03:24:30 then for some reason and this is kind of like something that kind of cropped up a little bit
03:24:35 um i noticed it a little bit in a dress rosa it's it feels very obvious to me and Wano
03:24:41 is that they start introducing all these other side characters like a lot of side characters
03:24:47 yeah yeah and and the side characters will be the people will be the people waiting for the straw
03:24:53 hats to show up so it just becomes waiting for straw hats so it's not about just like an individual
03:24:58 they're waiting for a specific straw hat member to show up and to take out the specific bad guy
03:25:04 crew member right and i guess that wouldn't be too bad if if not for the fact that all these side
03:25:11 characters also have very compelling motives like incredibly compelling motives of why they
03:25:19 want to like fight the people they want to fight and i think it's bad to let the one they'll let
03:25:23 the straw hats do it for them i think it i think it yeah i think it kind of kills a little bit
03:25:29 emotional connection to it you know because the problem with i think one of my issues like okay
03:25:35 look if you if you want there's nothing wrong with the straw hats there's no like there's nothing
03:25:40 wrong with the straw hats fighting the fights they fight i just want there to be kind of
03:25:45 something more going on rather than like the straw hat is there to just fight this one guy
03:25:51 because like i think my big example is all the samurai's that were like this whole time this
03:25:56 fucking what is like a 20 year plan that they had just to the feet kaito it all leads up to this one
03:26:02 moment where they finally show up at the top to like fight kaito right and i and and ultimately
03:26:09 they don't they ultimately they don't stand a chance again i mean it was like a 20 year plan
03:26:13 they all have this emotional connection to kaito elder problem seems to stem from kaito it's all
03:26:19 these things they're connected to kaito right but then no they can't do it and then luffy is there
03:26:24 luckily to the feet kaito and it's like there's nothing wrong with luffy fighting kaito but
03:26:29 luffy like there's not besides like what they're his friends with them sure that's fine but like
03:26:34 what's the thing with luffy and and and kaito and i and i feel like you don't have to like
03:26:41 there's not like there's ways to write this to not make it like you have to rewrite the whole
03:26:46 arc like maybe um kaito whatever ideology kaito is has is opposed to luffy's ideology in a way
03:26:55 aside from but they didn't really seem like kaito kaito believes in anything which is kind of i
03:26:59 always thought was kind of weird because when they first introduced kaito he's like straight up trying
03:27:03 to commit suicide yeah and i thought like oh there he's like he's going to be the kind of guy who's
03:27:09 interested in like he's going to be like an accelerationist or something he's going to be
03:27:13 interested in trying to like wipe out the world as fast as possible and wiping out everyone in it
03:27:18 and luffy's going to be the guy who's like no living his base actually but but no that really
03:27:22 doesn't seem to be kaito he's just a strong guy who wants to be strong yeah right exactly and
03:27:28 and then at the same time there's all these other fights happening where like other side
03:27:32 characters are fighting other like members of the of the what they call the beast pirates
03:27:37 and and they're not really dealing any major damage they're kind of just chipping damage away
03:27:42 until a strong hat character a strong hat crew member comes in and they like you know defeat
03:27:47 that person right they're kind of like warming up the battle for them and it's so it's so kind of
03:27:54 frustrating you know to read i agree with that as the the fact that there's so many new characters
03:28:01 they're always introducing and they don't have anything to do it's like the story could not it
03:28:09 could be told without the straw hats being there at all like early on it's this it's the plight of
03:28:16 the straw hats fighting against another pirate crew or trying to survive against like crocodile and
03:28:20 his organization and they're just like by themselves and that's why they have to pair off to fight
03:28:27 everyone but when there's like a whole bunch of people already doing a fight like in Dressrosa
03:28:33 there was the one armed a one-legged guy what's his name chorazon or chorazon or something
03:28:42 i thought i forgot his name he was a toy soldier the former king well the former former the
03:28:48 no he wasn't the king he was like the he was the gladiator he was gonna be though like oh right
03:28:54 like it was set up that he was gonna become the king because he married like the princess and
03:28:58 their yeah daughter whatnot right yeah so like he has um like a big reason to come up and fight
03:29:07 uh the the don flamingo pirate crew um you know he's finally been freed from his toy prison
03:29:15 and like he has a battle and it really should be about him
03:29:19 and but then there's all there's all this other stuff going on with the pirates
03:29:23 and also with law and uh it's it's it gets it gets it gets confusing and muddled the more
03:29:31 factions that are involved in any one singular event and i like it when a straw hat character a
03:29:38 straw hat member gets their battle because that's you know we were with them pre like uh the
03:29:46 battle at marinford with their little adventures the the straw hat pirates and they're trying to
03:29:51 fight like it's very simple one pirate crew is the protagonists against the villains and that's
03:29:58 like every island and um the more like side characters need their own screen time the less
03:30:04 the straw hat pirates get of their own screen time but luffy always has the main screen time at the
03:30:09 top so it's like it's spread out and it's just it's not satisfying yeah it's not satisfying enough
03:30:17 there's not enough time or space for all these individual characters to get their their their
03:30:23 emotional thing and and this is kind of what i mean by like oh this never happens in hunter hunter
03:30:31 because in hunter hunter they're not like interested in the main character gone fighting the bad guy of
03:30:38 each arc right because like there's so like in a traditional shonen there's like so many like
03:30:44 villains in the hunter hunter arcs that would have been like and the final fight of this fight
03:30:49 is gone versus this villain right but that actually never really fucking happens it's only like one
03:30:54 season or like one arc and with villain with a gone fighting the villain but all the other ones
03:31:02 um it's either like another character is like either fighting the villain or realizing something
03:31:09 about like the bad guy and about themselves right and and like i think in i think a big example
03:31:17 of this is in the chimera and arc like the chimera and king like um in the traditional shonen gone
03:31:24 would be the guy to fight him at the end right like if this was one piece and gone it was like
03:31:29 luffy they would have just made gone fight him but no instead there's like another character
03:31:33 who's like beyond stronger than gone who ends up fighting the chimera and king
03:31:37 and even that fight like goes in like in a very different direction i think what's also kind of
03:31:42 great is that in hunter hunter the the power system like is like so well defined that like they never
03:31:48 have to like introduce something new they just like everything they show is it could always be
03:31:54 explained like they always kind of they already explained how like everything works so anytime
03:31:58 something kind of new or wacky pops up we already like get that like this is this ability like we
03:32:03 know this and the fact of the matter is that we're constantly reminded that like uh our main
03:32:11 character gone is not the strongest not in an effort to like say like oh he has a long way to go
03:32:18 but but more like to kind of show how big the world of hunter hunter is that like
03:32:26 you're this one kid and sure you are strong actually it's kind of scary how strong you are
03:32:31 but there are at least like 500 other people above you and it's not about beating these people it's
03:32:41 about kind of like your own kind of goal you know and you're just going to get stronger as you go
03:32:46 through like the adventure but with like one piece i think it just boils down to eventually
03:32:51 luffy has to become the strongest guy on the fucking planet right and um it's kind of like i mean
03:32:58 i mean it works for like chun and i think like when one piece ends and it doesn't matter if the
03:33:03 ending is good or bad i feel like if it's good that's great that's awesome if it's bad i still
03:33:10 feel like at the end of the day that people are going to still label one piece probably the greatest
03:33:13 shonen ever written and i and i 100% agree with that sentiment but like hunter hunter is just a
03:33:21 really good manga like i feel like it it it passes like it passes the threshold of like a shonen
03:33:28 and it's just a good manga it's just i should i should read it i should read it story um yeah i
03:33:33 mean you might like i don't i don't know but i like it it's really good um i think the anime
03:33:38 doesn't really i think the anime does a really good job i'm always finding myself wishing i knew
03:33:42 what people were talking about when they talk about it so that's probably a sign that i should
03:33:47 check it out at some point i think the ending that the anime chooses is like the perfect ending
03:33:52 and if the manga ended like that i thought like okay dude bum 10 out of 10 banger manga but the
03:33:59 manga keeps going and it's fine right but i'm but the thing is like i'm just not that interested
03:34:04 in reading like the rest of it and it's and it's not like the quality has gone down it's like still
03:34:09 consistently good but like like the two like to me the um once like in episode two of the anime
03:34:16 once gone meets kiloa that's when the show starts because that's like this is this is these are our
03:34:23 characters this is our duo and it's all about it's all about them and once they go they're
03:34:27 separate ways that's it that's the end of the series for me right yeah um but yeah i would
03:34:33 recommend it it's really good really good anime well while you were saying all that i read the
03:34:39 new chapter nice so there's so pretty bass uh when it uh new chapter 10 it was good it was a
03:34:48 masterpiece well a twist a twist has been revealed twist well we found out we found out who the
03:34:58 butler was we found out who the butler was yeah i did the butler is that what they said
03:35:05 yeah the butler's wife and something vega punk
03:35:15 um i gotta i gotta pee i'll be i'll be right back i'm sorry i apologize
03:35:24 um you know i should read i should reclear us uh i should recourse a gun smoke i saw you have
03:35:30 three chapters out yeah i got three chapters fourth one is gonna be on fourth one's gonna be
03:35:37 first available through purchasing then it's gonna be on my patreon well i haven't figured out the
03:35:45 best way to like release it but i want to have like a you can bet you can buy it then it'll be on the
03:35:51 perfect comic party and then it'll be on my site and then it'll be that'll be it
03:36:00 that's pretty cool how many um how many chapters do you have on mine for clover sir i finished the
03:36:07 sketching the like blocking out of all the pages so it's just a matter of doing line art and shading
03:36:12 and and everything cleaning uh it's gonna be 10 chapters each chapter is around 15 to 20 pages
03:36:19 the last chapter is quite long it's like 23 actually there's gonna be more because i still
03:36:25 haven't drawn there's like a couple pages of epilogue because you gotta you gotta end a western
03:36:31 with the right enough into the sunset haven't got there yet kind of reminds me of um not really
03:36:40 an epilogue but um was it uh and for the the movie fistful of dollars which was like the start of
03:36:47 like the yes the good and the bad and the ugly trilogy um uh yes so julian yeah and in the
03:36:56 in the first movie um it's gone back it uh i'm freaking back it starts with all over shut up
03:37:05 jesus talking what oh i'm talking my headphones got disconnected okay go on but in the um fistful
03:37:13 of dollars um in the movie in the original movie the clint eastwood character just shows up into
03:37:18 town and he starts a fight with like the gang there right and that's the whole movie um but in
03:37:25 the tv version when it came out what they did was that they added a prologue because the thing is that
03:37:31 like um the clint eastwood character in the movie is not a good person like he's kind of like a piece
03:37:38 but he's fighting against people who are way worse so like you know you're kind of like
03:37:43 compelled to be on his side but i guess that was like too much when the movie was brought to tv
03:37:49 so what they did was that they added a prologue where they add like a narration talking to clint
03:37:53 eastwood saying like um they're talking to him like he's like a federal agent and they're like oh
03:37:58 this town has been overrun by a gang go stop them and to make it seem like oh he works for the law
03:38:03 like that's that's what happened the new prologue and it's just so like funny because it's like
03:38:08 you can't just have a character who just so happens to be like morally gray and then he finds people
03:38:14 who are a whore it it has to it has to be that like he's on the side of good so everything he's
03:38:20 doing is ultimately for the greater good that i mean that's the whole fun of the spaghetti westerns
03:38:26 as opposed to like the older like fifties sixties westerns where the good guy is the good guy and
03:38:32 everyone likes him and the bad guy's the bad guy and he's got a mustache um is the in spaghetti
03:38:37 westerns and like other cool western movies uh it's morally gray it's just like more realistic in
03:38:44 the like if you're a guy with a gun you can just shoot a guy and it might not be a good thing to
03:38:50 do that but you know um you do what you got to do a lot of there's a handful of like early westerns
03:38:56 where um one of the characters are kind of like morally good i mean that's where the term like what
03:39:00 is it white hat comes from yeah is the good guy and then black hat like and i think a big example
03:39:05 of like the kind of like um the major like difference between like a western back then a western now
03:39:13 and if you look at if you watch the original true grit movie and then you watch the remake um and in
03:39:18 the original the the character i forget the character i think he's played by jeff bridge is in the
03:39:23 remake but that character i think he's played by john wane yeah he's played by john wane the john wane
03:39:28 everyone's john wane in the in the old days yeah john wane character is like this nice he's i think
03:39:34 he's a nicer person he's like a good guy he's like awesome and cool but in the remake he's like a drunk
03:39:40 he's like fucking like past his prime and he's like an asshole and whatnot and the big reason why
03:39:47 like westerns kind of became darker and grittier is because of the movie blazing saddles that really
03:39:54 like killed that really killed the trope of the whole like a really like good guy western
03:40:01 man doing good and whatnot all they needed was one good lampoon right and you know you know what's
03:40:07 another you know what's another movie that kind of did something another parry that kind of did
03:40:11 something similar for their own is it spaceballs no not spaceballs okay it's fucking austin powers
03:40:17 what for like spy thrillers for for the james the james spawn reboot that happened in like the
03:40:25 early 2000s with daniel craig uh the reason so in those early like i think the first three or four
03:40:31 movies there there was no jokes no character would say a fucking joke in those movies and that's because
03:40:38 of austin powers like that's because they were like we're not we're not like austin powers right
03:40:43 because that's because i think it was this period where like people weren't like
03:40:47 interested in james bond movies and the popular side guys was austin powers right like oh this is
03:40:53 kind of silly right so when uh they they brought back james bond they're all like okay we're gonna
03:41:00 make a serious james bond or he's gonna be he's gonna you know it was very post-9 11 like the
03:41:06 pierce brazil movies are kind of silly yeah they are they're over the top yeah yeah because i mean one
03:41:12 of the bad guys was like fucking christ for walkings and one of those movies but but yeah but
03:41:18 with um the daniel craig one they took it super serious this new james bond is like very there's
03:41:23 he never smiles never smiles he has ptsd because you know we were in the iraq war and that was hot
03:41:29 to give it ptsd right that was some hot shit yeah that was some hot shit and yeah so it's funny
03:41:40 funny funny funny but yeah i'll read i'll read clara so next time i come back i'll have read
03:41:46 everything hell yes i hope you do i hope everyone at home also does
03:41:53 yeah they should also one one little thing uh john wane i gotta read the i gotta read the new
03:41:58 chapter i haven't read chapter four yet it's not out yet well it'll be out for amazon but it's in
03:42:03 the book it's in the book so you should buy the book you should buy the book you should buy the
03:42:06 i'm not gonna do that no i am no i am i am gonna do it oh silly billy and i gotta by this time i

03:42:26 gonna buy that and i'm gonna buy clara said yes and i bought and i already bought my cobble
03:42:31 mcpagliacci oh hell yeah but i'm i'm accumulating order now i'm consuming i'm consuming
03:42:39 western comics i'm support i'm supporting i'm supporting creators whose work i appreciate
03:42:45 the average supporter i'm creating
03:42:51 i'm created over here mom oh i'm creating but like uh uh john wane right he's like
03:42:59 he was the big movie star yeah he played a lot of cowboys he was known for that i think
03:43:04 john wane made famous in diehard yeah uh uh john wane he uh he just looks like someone's dad
03:43:14 which was always funny to me because he's always like in these cowboy films and he's like the cool
03:43:19 guy the the serious guy the sensible guy and the guy who knows what's up and he's got he's got the
03:43:25 quick hand but he just looks like a strawberry like a guy's dad it feels like it's a you think
03:43:30 like a vanity project that he's always in yeah well cowboy movies are very dad core
03:43:36 they're very dad core it's just sort of like that they're on they're on again again i was
03:43:42 thinking of clint eastwood no you're right john wane does just look like some guy's dad
03:43:46 yeah clint eastwood looks like a hot boy yeah yeah he was like a good looking guy
03:43:51 john wane literally looks like you've ever seen um the church of the subgenius
03:43:57 yeah i heard of it uh nope it was like kind of like a ironic cult that people would join
03:44:06 yeah it's kind of a it's kind of a gen X thing i think yeah it was like oh it'd be so ironic if
03:44:12 we were part of like a funny little cult and um yeah that's what it was well like their logo
03:44:18 the the logo of the church of the subgenius is um man there's something so i think i'm a little i
03:44:25 think i'm a little bit i think i got a little bit of that nostalgia for a time that i never
03:44:31 experienced about like fucking like gen X irony culture i think i probably would have been like
03:44:37 all in on the church is the subgenius if i was like you know at the right age when it was like
03:44:43 at its peak uh but um yeah this is its logo is this guy called jr dobs jr bob dobs and like
03:44:51 they that yeah john wane looks like that looks like this guy lamal that's pretty funny
03:44:59 yeah i thought this guy's like a generic like dad picture right yeah like yeah i don't know if it's
03:45:07 based on an actual person or what but yeah it's it's it's meant to it's meant to look like uh like
03:45:12 you know mr walton or you know the idea of like a post post war old timey you know american father
03:45:23 figure yeah yeah it's funny that it's funny to imagine that like the that stereotype involves
03:45:30 smoking a pipe because smoking a pipe is fucking disgusting smoking a pipe is like foul it's like
03:45:35 a foul thing to do but it's let's put together image of oh yes a respectable dad it's it's classy
03:45:42 he's got his pipe and it looks cool in an image i think you wouldn't want to be around a guy who

03:45:53 pipe weed smoker and then it's fine that's why they have the smoking room yeah true and various
03:46:00 business but then they smell but then they smell everywhere they go they're gonna smell like it

03:48:30 what it's the wildling way it's the wildling way you got it that's how you keep the gene pool
03:48:35 broad and and deep you gotta you gotta you gotta kidnap a wife from a neighboring twine god you
03:48:41 know who's twine i'm maybe i'm enabling twine never doing twine you know who's really ruining
03:48:48 the gene pool i committed sexual i committed i committed kidnapping and sexual assault against
03:48:53 members of the enemy twine oh i impregnated them against their will that keeps the gene strong
03:48:59 our twine will prosper oh that was that was really like ruining the gene pool like you know who
03:49:08 was like the worst people brown people i'm sorry what we're fixing the gene pool and in my opinion
03:49:17 but all right tell me well um comedians ugly comedians that have hot wives are like ruining
03:49:24 the gene pool they're fucking they're putting their ugly just because they're funny just because
03:49:28 they're funny really you're gonna let them ruin the our fucking our humanity with right ugly children
03:49:34 just because they're funny because by eating by eating a lot of food uh they they grow become
03:49:40 very large and then according to lamarckian genetics that means that they'll pass on the
03:49:44 largeness gene to their offspring so they're they're gonna have fat children you see that they're
03:49:51 ruining the ruining the gene pool it's i agree i agree exactly uh i've never been swimming in the
03:49:59 gene pool i i've heard it's great somebody i've heard it's nice i think it was i think it was
03:50:04 galactic to be posted at something about how in the in the lion king like they don't they they
03:50:11 understand what genes are like scar is talking about like the gene pool but there's some other
03:50:16 thing where like they're completely baffled by some like really very simple like mechanical concept
03:50:24 i don't i don't remember what the example was but it's like yeah why is scarred
03:50:27 why are these lions in the pride land of africa why is he talking about
03:50:32 the gene pool what does he know about men gregor mendel it's messed up he's right he's he's

03:54:00 why do you hate javajiga because they're the the person who did the
03:54:04 the fucking whole like, oh, graphic novel section, manga section, it's so fucking over.
03:54:09 No, they're not. Wait, is that them?
03:54:11 Yeah, that's them.
03:54:12 No, I didn't realize it was them.
03:54:14 Every time, every time, like, I've never seen a good take from them.
03:54:18 I swear I've only ever seen, like, annoying ass takes from them.
03:54:22 Oh, I kind of thought, I kind of like, okay.
03:54:25 Maybe, maybe they did something.
03:54:27 Well, I mean, well, I mean, okay, you know what, you know what, you know what, I mean,
03:54:30 I'm actually not that mad because, I mean, I don't even disagree.
03:54:32 Like, it is over in the sense that, like, yeah, they're making more.
03:54:35 Yeah, they're making more manga because the money is there.
03:54:38 It's been over, like, the thing is, like, it's been over since, like, the 90s,
03:54:41 everyone has been saying, oh, it's dying, it's dying, it's dying.
03:54:44 It's like, yeah.
03:54:45 Right, right.
03:54:46 Just read, please.
03:54:48 Don't get drawn, you idiot.
03:54:49 Read Daniel Klaus.
03:54:51 He's gonna have a new book in October.
03:54:53 You can pre-order it now.
03:54:54 Really?
03:54:55 Yes.
03:54:56 Actually, have you read Patience, which was the last book?
03:54:58 That one came out in 2016.
03:54:59 What was the one you got me to read?
03:55:01 Dan, it was David Boring.
03:55:05 That was also Dan Klaus, right?
03:55:07 Yeah, that was Daniel Klaus.
03:55:08 Yeah, that's the only one I've read.
03:55:10 Hey, I just hit 1600.
03:55:11 Just hit 1600 Twitch followers.
03:55:13 Hey, oh, that's 40 followers.
03:55:15 Whoa.
03:55:16 I think you should read Defray next, Ben.
03:55:21 I think you'll like Defray.
03:55:23 It's kind of like David Boring, but it's kind of...
03:55:26 Maybe I'll order it on Amazon when I'm ordering Clarissa.
03:55:30 It's Daniel Klaus doing his version of like, oh, superheroes in real life, but it's like...
03:55:37 No one ever talks about how he really shows how pathetic it is.
03:55:43 There's been other things where they're like, oh, superheroes in real life, but I think
03:55:46 Daniel Klaus probably hits it the most realistic in what would happen.
03:55:51 How do you feel about...
03:55:53 Who was that guy who was the superhero in real life in real life?
03:55:58 Phoenix Jones.
03:55:59 Phoenix Jones, yeah.
03:56:01 Yeah.
03:56:02 Do you ever see that?
03:56:03 There's an atrocity guide video about Phoenix Jones.
03:56:05 Yeah, he's like, end up selling drugs.
03:56:09 Yeah, he was selling drugs on the side.
03:56:12 I think...
03:56:14 He was busting people for selling drugs while he was...
03:56:18 Like, that's the terrible thing.
03:56:19 I wouldn't begrudge him.
03:56:21 I wouldn't begrudge him a side hustle.
03:56:23 I wouldn't begrudge him a side hustle, but the fact that he was busting other people
03:56:26 for it while he was doing it is like, ugh, that's so disgusting.
03:56:30 That was part of the plan to come off as a superhero, that drug bust, everyone butt your own.
03:56:37 That sounds like a plot to something, like Spider-Man Story or something.
03:56:44 That's a really good video.
03:56:45 I wonder if atrocity guides made any more...
03:56:48 I think they have.
03:56:49 I really like that channel.
03:56:51 It is good.
03:56:52 It's like down the rabbit hole, but better, and they still make videos.
03:56:55 I think they pump out stuff faster, which I really like.
03:56:58 I really hate that down the rabbit hole would spend so long on just one video.
03:57:03 I think they've been working on one for a long ass time, and it's like...
03:57:07 It won't be worth a wait.
03:57:10 Yeah, that's the kind of annoying thing.
03:57:12 The Wings of Emotion video, bad.
03:57:15 Most of their other videos are very good, but I don't...
03:57:19 Do you know what the new one is going to be on?
03:57:22 I think that...
03:57:25 I hear people back and forth talking about it.
03:57:29 I thought I heard someone say that, oh, they're doing the Keemstar retrospective, or they're doing...
03:57:36 That sucks.
03:57:37 I mean, hopefully not that.
03:57:38 That sucks really bad.
03:57:39 That blows.
03:57:40 Or like some sort of expansion on Furries, or they're doing...
03:57:43 Garbage.
03:57:44 Did they do Gaia Online already?
03:57:46 I don't know if they did Gaia Online.
03:57:48 I don't think so.
03:57:51 Okay, Atrocity Guide has won...
03:57:53 Oh no, Atrocity Guide has only made one in the last six months.
03:57:58 Yeah, the last two down the rabbit hole videos I thought were kind of not interesting.
03:58:04 Wings of Redemption, I would say Wings of Redemption is a bad video.
03:58:08 Really?
03:58:09 I thought that one was interesting.
03:58:11 I liked how it was secretly in Origins of Keemstar video.
03:58:15 Yeah, I didn't feel like that was intentional.
03:58:17 It was slowly rising in the background.
03:58:19 Yeah, probably not.
03:58:20 That was like an accident.
03:58:21 8.6...
03:58:22 Oh God, okay, great.
03:58:24 Cool, his worst video has the most views, so this is going to be what his fucking stupid
03:58:27 channel turns into now.
03:58:28 Awesome.
03:58:29 Cool.
03:58:30 Oh fuck, I haven't seen the last Atrocities Guide video, even though I did a podcast episode
03:58:35 on the movie that they're talking about in that video.
03:58:39 Oh, the kidnapped and forced to make action films?
03:58:42 Yeah, they're talking about the only North Korean Kaiju film, Pogusari.
03:58:49 Well, I've heard you talk about that.
03:58:51 Yeah, Pogusari, it's great.
03:58:52 We do have an official Toku cast on it.
03:58:55 I haven't seen the two newest ones.
03:58:57 The one about Bob's Game is really good.
03:59:00 I mean, I've watched all of these and they're all really good.
03:59:04 It's a great channel.
03:59:06 Bob's Game is one of the few examples of earlier where we were talking about, oh, just make
03:59:12 games for yourself.
03:59:14 Bob's Game is the ultimate that because the guy is insane.
03:59:17 Have you seen the Mandalore Gaming video about, fuck, Mandalore Gaming?
03:59:27 I think I might have mentioned this one before, but I can't remember the name again.
03:59:31 Atrocity.
03:59:36 Oh, fuck.
03:59:38 It's the one where you play as the edgy teen who kills pedophiles.
03:59:43 No.
03:59:45 The Simpsons Game?
03:59:47 No.
03:59:51 I know about the Kanye Game.
03:59:54 Anonymous Agony.
03:59:56 Anonymous Agony.
03:59:58 That's another one that is just like somebody made it in RPG Maker.
04:00:03 Bob's Game looks so dumb.
04:00:08 It's like, hey, what if I made a game about me in real life walking around my house?
04:00:15 You should make that game, then.
04:00:21 What's the name of that one guy?
04:00:22 Oh, Austin Cowell?
04:00:24 Austin McConnell.
04:00:25 Yeah.
04:00:27 That guy, he's the guy who made a video where he was talking about that film that he made
04:00:33 that was bad all those years ago.
04:00:37 I don't know what you're talking about.
04:00:40 It's called, I made a movie.
04:00:42 It's Stunk.
04:00:44 Oh, Austin McConnell.
04:00:46 Yeah, Austin McConnell.
04:00:48 Oh yeah, and didn't that guy plagiarize his video about the Special Olympics team?
04:00:55 Oh, did he?
04:00:57 It might have just been a case that he made another, he just made another video with a very similar
04:01:05 content to one that John Boyce made.
04:01:08 And I don't know if it's like ever technically been called out as plagiarism, but
04:01:12 the John Boyce video is better, and John Boyce is better than Austin McConnell.
04:01:16 Fuck Austin McConnell.
04:01:18 Austin McConnell is very, he has such like a, the quality of his videos jump so much like back and forth.
04:01:26 I feel.
04:01:27 I haven't seen a good one in a while.
04:01:29 The majority of them are kind of like mid, and also I think you ever like,
04:01:34 I liked his one about the Harry Potter play.
04:01:38 I thought that one was pretty good.
04:01:39 I ever like, and this is kind of like a kind of like specific, this is kind of a certain
04:01:44 content creator where they're like, they have pretty good insight on like writing and like
04:01:49 criticism and whatnot.
04:01:50 But when it comes to them making art, it's always kind of like, wow, this is bad.
04:01:55 Yeah.
04:01:56 You know what I'm saying?
04:01:57 Many such cases.
04:01:58 Yeah.
04:01:59 Yeah.
04:02:00 Austin McConnell is kind of like that because I feel like he has really good insight on certain
04:02:06 things.
04:02:07 But then when he was talking about his, because he's all like, oh, we're making like a, we're
04:02:11 making kind of like an animated movie based on public domain superheroes.
04:02:15 And I'm going to make my own like little animated superheroes cinematic universe with public
04:02:20 domain characters, which isn't that bad of an idea.
04:02:24 But when I heard his kind of retelling of one of the characters stories, like his version
04:02:28 of it, it's like, wow, it just sounds just as dull as like the original.
04:02:33 Like, why don't you like do something completely different?
04:02:36 Yeah.
04:02:37 I see.
04:02:38 Yeah.
04:02:39 Because there's already like so many, there's been so many comics about public domain superheroes
04:02:43 and other public domain characters.
04:02:45 And like, I think people, I think people have done really like beyond amazing job as being
04:02:50 incredibly clever with those characters or going, going in such interesting directions
04:02:55 that like whatever like Austin McConnell is trying to do, it sounds kind of like whatever.
04:03:01 And I'm pretty sure when the movie, when this movie is finished, it's going to be like very
04:03:05 mid.
04:03:06 It's not going to be like, and he's not going to be like incredibly good or incredibly bad.
04:03:11 He's going to be like, okay, I'm going to forget about it.
04:03:14 Yeah.
04:03:15 Did you?
04:03:16 Okay.
04:03:17 You know, Vito Gizwaldi.
04:03:18 Yeah.
04:03:19 Is he making like a comic?
04:03:22 I don't know.
04:03:24 He's making some kind of superhero thing.
04:03:29 And I don't know what the deal is with it, but I don't like that guy.
04:03:32 So it's probably bad, but I haven't, I don't know what the, I think it's called super killer.
04:03:38 And I don't know what the deal is, but I kind of want to know just so I can be like, I was
04:03:42 right.
04:03:43 It's stupid.
04:03:44 Yeah.
04:03:45 That's the guy who just do the constantly like, oh, it's gone woke and now it sucks or he
04:03:51 does.
04:03:52 I think he does that like semi ironically, but not completely ironically, but like semi
04:04:00 ironically.
04:04:01 Yeah.
04:04:02 His thumbnail, learnaboutsuperkiller.org.
04:04:03 What is that?
04:04:04 You know, it's funny.
04:04:05 Like yesterday, a couple of days ago, I think I made like a tweet Friday saying like, hey
04:04:13 guys, post your comic recommendations that aren't like Marvel or DC.
04:04:17 And someone recommended the comic common America, which is not a good comic.
04:04:22 Common America.
04:04:23 Oh, I know about common America.
04:04:25 Yeah.
04:04:26 Common America sucks.
04:04:27 Oh, the one that Mary whether collabed with.
04:04:29 Yeah.
04:04:30 It's fucking even though they're like a bunch of fucking far right motherfuckers.
04:04:34 Yeah.
04:04:35 A bunch of fucking MAGA heads.
04:04:36 It's like, it's like the most mid person teams up with like the worst person I know.
04:04:42 It's I was thinking about making a video.
04:04:44 Cool.
04:04:45 Yeah.
04:04:46 I think because it fucking I have I talked about common America before on this podcast.
04:04:55 I think maybe a bit.
04:04:56 Yeah.
04:04:57 I know about it from you.
04:04:58 It's it's so it's so funny.
04:05:00 It's just so funny like the whole and I've probably have said this before where her origin
04:05:05 story is literally like, Oh, what's Peter Parker?
04:05:08 Oh, his uncle got shot due to him being like selfish and he's like, I must take responsibility
04:05:13 for these amazing powers I've gained while common America's origin is like one time my
04:05:18 science teacher told me to play baseball with boys, but I'm a girl.
04:05:23 I want to do girl things.
04:05:25 And then she gets the powers that's incredible.
04:05:28 It's fucking it's just it's just amazing.
04:05:31 And this this was this was the Marvel killer.
04:05:33 This was like, yeah, we're going to out so Marvel and DC fucking.
04:05:38 That's amazing.
04:05:39 All right.
04:05:40 Here it comes.
04:05:41 Super killer.
04:05:42 Give me give me the five give me the five second pitch on super killer.
04:05:48 Here comes super killer the multiverse is home to a variety of super powered individuals
04:05:53 nobles heroes who risk their lives to protect the world from destruction.
04:05:56 Fortunately, for a multiversal assassin, Sam King, these heroes won't be going down without
04:06:01 a fight.
04:06:03 So he okay, this comic's going to kick some ass.
04:06:07 Okay.
04:06:08 God fucking like like these these guys who are always like, like, oh, I'm going to make
04:06:13 my better superhero than Marvel and DC.
04:06:16 They always look awful.
04:06:18 Like none of them could design sounds like in superhero sounds so fucking generic.
04:06:23 He looks like a background character from my hero academia is a learn learn learn more.
04:06:31 This comp is going to is a hilarious blood soaked superhero romp where absolutely no
04:06:35 one is safe.
04:06:36 Okay.
04:06:37 So it's edgy superheroes.
04:06:41 I really super it's superheroes with blood.
04:06:45 It's terrible.
04:06:46 Here's a fucking sucks.
04:06:48 It's worse than I thought.
04:06:51 Isn't that Deadpool already?
04:06:53 This is like imagine if Deadpool had a bad design and sucked.
04:06:57 All right.
04:06:58 I come away from this pitch having what would what would I tell someone if I wanted to recommend
04:07:04 them super killer?
04:07:05 I'd be like, it's a superhero.
04:07:09 And he kills people.
04:07:10 What?
04:07:11 Oh, wow.
04:07:12 Never heard that one before fucking 10 and 10 idea.
04:07:16 I don't know.
04:07:17 Wow.
04:07:18 I thought there would be a hook, but there's but there's no hook.
04:07:20 I'd be lost at superhero.
04:07:22 I haven't been interested in a superhero design.
04:07:25 They lose you at superhero.
04:07:26 100 years.
04:07:27 Superhero.
04:07:28 But then you say, but and then you go, huh, then you get your back again and they and
04:07:31 then they put their mouth to you and they say, but he kills people.
04:07:34 And then you go, oh, no, you lost me again.
04:07:36 A superhero literally doing anything is like unappealing to me because I just don't like
04:07:40 what they are.
04:07:41 There's probably some twist on the formula that might be if they wear like a costume.
04:07:48 Get out of here.
04:07:49 They wear a mask.
04:07:50 If they have a double identity as a million is the same thing over and over again.
04:07:54 Superheroes are always the same.
04:07:57 Stop it.
04:07:58 You know, I'm so tired of superheroes.
04:08:02 The thing is, people talk about stuff like superhero fatigue.
04:08:05 Ultimately, you just need like one good superhero movie and then people usually shut up about
04:08:09 it.
04:08:10 But if someone's not interested in superheroes, that's fine, like there's no problem with
04:08:13 that.
04:08:14 I don't really care.
04:08:15 Okay.
04:08:16 Okay.
04:08:17 I get it.
04:08:18 I get it.
04:08:19 Okay.
04:08:20 So the idea of super killer.
04:08:21 Okay.
04:08:22 He kills other superheroes.
04:08:25 It's basically like he kills characters that resemble other heroes that you might be more
04:08:30 familiar with.
04:08:31 Like he kills Superman types and he kills magical girls and he kills what's this guy?
04:08:39 What's this guy?
04:08:40 What?
04:08:41 Who?
04:08:42 Super killer?
04:08:43 A guy who looks like Batman.
04:08:44 He kills characters that remind you of comic.
04:08:48 This fucking sucks.
04:08:51 What if a superhero went around killing characters that you're familiar with?
04:08:57 God, you know this character.
04:08:59 You know, my expectations were low and I'm still disappointed.
04:09:03 Give, do you know this character?
04:09:06 Martial law?
04:09:07 No.
04:09:08 No.
04:09:09 It's drawn by Kevin O'Neill, which is a British artist.
04:09:14 You should know this, Gib.
04:09:15 But he put an American flag on the gun?
04:09:18 No.
04:09:19 Oh, because the story takes place in America.
04:09:21 An American flag on a gun is like, it's like, that's good.
04:09:25 Anyway, super killer just sounds like this.
04:09:29 I can see he's got like a Batman cowl on his little thing there, his little belt there.
04:09:36 Yeah.
04:09:37 It's funny because martial law is kind of like, imagine if someone like, what's the
04:09:43 name of that one political cartoonist who labels everything like a for a writer?
04:09:47 Oh, he's a libertarian.
04:09:49 Ben Garrison.
04:09:50 Yeah.
04:09:51 Yeah.
04:09:52 Yeah.
04:09:53 So like imagine if Ben Garrison like wrote like a superhero comic.
04:09:57 But the thing is that what's great about like martial law is that he's like a fucking,
04:10:02 he's like my favorite fascist.
04:10:04 He's a really awesome fascist character.
04:10:06 Hell yeah.
04:10:08 And and and basically like, so the gist is that he's basically a cop for superheroes,
04:10:14 right?
04:10:16 And but the thing is that in their universe, superheroes are like several things that aside
04:10:21 from like being like propped up as like protectors of like good in society.
04:10:28 The majority are superheroes are like former like war veterans who are who have superpowers
04:10:35 and are fucking insane and they just kill random people on the street.
04:10:38 Yeah.
04:10:39 And the and martial law comes in and fucking shoots the shit under and and rips them up
04:10:45 part and yeah, this actually martial law is like a big influence on villain verse.
04:10:51 Oh, wait, you might you might have mentioned this guy before, maybe, maybe.
04:10:56 Yeah.
04:10:57 And the the the book was like co-created by a thing, one of the guys behind Judge Dredd.
04:11:04 But but I think this also Linkara hates his book.
04:11:08 He really fucking does not like this character.
04:11:11 But I love this guy because Linkara is
04:11:15 like for every because he's woke.
04:11:19 Actually, I would say he's just stupid.
04:11:22 But I'm damn.
04:11:23 But for every kind of like interesting thing Linkara has to say, I feel like he always has
04:11:27 two stupid things to say with it, too.
04:11:30 Because he talks about like, oh, I'm tired of stories where superheroes are bad.
04:11:35 We already know what superheroes being bad is like.
04:11:39 They're they're called super villain.
04:11:42 And it's like fucking the fucking card.
04:11:45 Wow, you know, do you not get the idea of a deconstruction?
04:11:49 Or or the fact that like or the fact that like, do you think cops are like all good?
04:11:54 Do you think like, wow, yeah, that really blows.
04:11:57 Do you think there's not like some sort of fucking moral?
04:12:00 Like maybe there's something else going on.
04:12:02 Maybe the fact that like you can't individually stop all crime one at a time
04:12:08 as a person, even with fucking superpowers.
04:12:10 And it's like, yeah, the idea, the idea is that the the superheroes are bad is not.
04:12:16 What if we made the superhero bad instead of good?
04:12:18 It's like the superhero does the things a superhero does.
04:12:21 But we see that, in fact, they are bad, actually.
04:12:25 I think what's great about martial law is that it has a really good design.
04:12:29 It's also very funny.
04:12:30 Everything is so exaggerated in martial law.
04:12:32 It's like it's also a cartoony, you know, like nothing is supposed to be taken like.
04:12:37 Like really seriously.
04:12:38 Like there's I think in the first story, I kind of have a problem
04:12:41 where they like take themselves too seriously at certain parts.
04:12:44 But everything else is like very it's very like goofy with it.
04:12:48 And I mean, the biggest example is that all the characters have their
04:12:52 like beliefs just like written out on them.
04:12:55 And like, oh, he has fear and loafing on on his like stomach.
04:13:00 His right arm has barbed wire because one of his power, his powers
04:13:04 that he doesn't feel any pain.
04:13:05 So like he like, you know, he fights other superheroes and they can't really hurt him.
04:13:10 And I think my favorite story is is the second story.
04:13:15 The second martial art story, martial law story where he fights the Avengers
04:13:19 and they're like all members of like an insane asylum.
04:13:22 And he's mostly and it's it's the story works so good when like
04:13:28 they're just doing like goofy shit.
04:13:30 Like there's like a one scene in in the second story
04:13:34 where he's like chasing a punisher proxy who has like a swatze gun in his forehead.
04:13:40 And and they're fighting in an elevator and this
04:13:44 this punisher guy is about to like electrocute him with some wires.
04:13:48 And he and he says the word superhero to martial law.
04:13:53 And then martial art like fucking like gets so pissed off from here.
04:13:56 The word superhero is all like like, oh, you said the you said the secret
04:14:00 world superheroes, my Shazam.
04:14:02 Many fucking like rips apart whenever it's holding them.
04:14:05 And it's it's just so it's just the more goofy it is.
04:14:08 I think it's the more funny it is.
04:14:11 And it's it's it's great.
04:14:13 I really like it.
04:14:15 The super killer looks really fucking dull.
04:14:17 Like this this concept has been done fucking.
04:14:19 I see I see nothing appealing about it.
04:14:22 Well, I'm glad I'm glad we put that to bed.
04:14:25 The thing of me is that superheroes
04:14:28 aesthetically are dead to me.
04:14:30 I hate colorful costumes with wacky powers
04:14:35 that a child could come up with.
04:14:38 And even if it's good, even if it's like a great thing,
04:14:41 I just don't like the look of a superhero.
04:14:43 I feel upset when I see such things.
04:14:47 Yeah, feel enraged.
04:14:49 Yeah, there's something there's something there's something a little off
04:14:51 putting about the whole just the whole aesthetic of the spandex clad hero.
04:14:55 I agree. It's a bit.
04:14:57 I feel a little bit like about it.
04:14:59 The way you see if it hadn't been like pushed when I was a film
04:15:03 when I was a little kid like 30 years when I was a little kid.
04:15:05 I didn't I'm completely desensitized when I was a little kid.
04:15:08 I didn't like movies that had animals like cartoons about animals.
04:15:11 I thought animals were for babies.
04:15:12 I wanted humans only please.
04:15:14 So now as an adult, I feel the same way about superheroes.
04:15:17 It's for babies.
04:15:18 And I just feel sick when I see it.
04:15:20 Yeah, a little bit even shows like the boys that people tell me are good.
04:15:23 I'm like, yeah, but like it's a fucking superhero thing.
04:15:26 They're going to have powers.
04:15:27 They're going to be like powers.
04:15:29 I get it.
04:15:30 They're going to show that the good guys are the bad guys, actually,
04:15:34 because they serve the status quo already seen.
04:15:36 Watchmen, I don't need to see it again in a TV show.
04:15:40 We've been going for four.
04:15:41 That's my trigger hours.
04:15:42 I feel like maybe it's time to be wrapping up
04:15:46 and maybe getting to to one piece discussion pretty soon.
04:15:50 Yes.
04:15:51 Cheesy. Let's let's do you have I mean.
04:15:55 Do you have if there's any if there's any last words
04:15:58 before you make you walk the plank, you know, speak them now.
04:16:01 I guess.
04:16:04 You know, I'm not interested in stories of colorful characters
04:16:08 with powers that children would come up with.
04:16:11 OK, just say you won't reveal it or skip it.
04:16:13 Just say you don't like.
04:16:14 I will not.
04:16:15 I already read it in my face until you make more of it.
04:16:20 Whoa.
04:16:21 Yeah, more, more, more, more, more is coming.
04:16:27 Villain versus different.
04:16:28 It feels different.
04:16:29 They're villains.
04:16:30 They're not in New York or like some alternative,
04:16:33 like the same New York where petty crime is the reason
04:16:37 somebody puts on a superhero mask.
04:16:39 Why would you do that?
04:16:40 Why would you feel like it's not like, I mean,
04:16:44 they're not even like in a society.
04:16:45 They're just like a completely chaotic.
04:16:47 They're just all in a bunch of like spaceships,
04:16:49 just like trying to all try to kill each other.
04:16:52 I don't know, it doesn't it doesn't feel at all
04:16:53 like a superhero story.
04:16:55 It's just a bunch of like monsters in space.
04:16:58 That like you want to sometimes they fight each other, I guess.
04:17:04 Yeah, it's just everyone.
04:17:06 Just like literally everyone that exists in the world
04:17:09 is trying to kill everyone else, right, right?
04:17:11 Because it's all villains.
04:17:12 Yeah, yeah.
04:17:13 Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
04:17:15 Well, there is a society, but like it doesn't whatever.
04:17:19 It doesn't matter.
04:17:20 It's not it's not crucial to the story I'm telling.
04:17:22 So it's not it's not like we don't really see it.
04:17:27 But yeah, anyway, pre-order make Paglacci.
04:17:30 You got like two days left on Sunday.
04:17:33 Should be the last day.
04:17:34 Actually, this Sunday, this coming Sunday,
04:17:36 I'm going to be on a live stream with a stereo.
04:17:38 Oh, cool.
04:17:39 And we're going to talk about we're going to talk about
04:17:41 make Paglacci ask him about his cancel Ben St.
04:17:43 shirt. Yeah, I'll I'll I'll ask him about that.
04:17:49 We're also going to be talking about the toddler show, Bluey.
04:17:53 I'm going to bluey I'm going to bluey pill
04:17:54 stereo on it.
04:17:58 I have some insight about the show.
04:18:00 I was on the ground floor for the show.
04:18:03 So, you know, congratulations.
04:18:06 But a bit of a deal.
04:18:08 Thank you.
04:18:09 Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.
04:18:10 Imagine imagine being into a kid's show for.
04:18:13 I can't imagine.
04:18:14 I would kill I would destroy myself.
04:18:16 I almost said I almost said kill myself.
04:18:18 But I would never say that.
04:18:24 Anyway, yeah, cool.
04:18:27 All right.
04:18:28 Prior to make Paglacci.
04:18:29 All right.
04:18:30 Thanks for joining us, Cheesy.
04:18:33 Now, get out of here.
04:18:34 You guys can you guys aren't going to do a voicemail.
04:18:38 We're going to do it after we do one piece of discussion.
04:18:41 That would be voicemail.
04:18:41 All right, then. Well, it's been it's been good.
04:18:44 I'll I'll talk.
04:18:46 Should we sink one more time?
04:18:47 Yeah, we can say one more time.
04:18:48 Yeah, that's good.
04:18:49 All right. Three, two, one, sink.
04:18:52 Sink three, two, one, sink.
04:18:55 Sink.
04:18:56 Elisa should probably use that one and not the early one.
04:19:00 Maybe sounds good.
04:19:01 All right. All right.
04:19:02 I'm going to stop recording.
04:19:03 Thanks for having me on.
04:19:04 I'll talk to you.
04:19:05 Our pleasure.
04:19:07 Thanks for jumping in.
04:19:09 All right.
04:19:11 All right.
04:19:13 Yeah, so I read I read one piece.
04:19:15 I read the new one piece while cheesy was talking about one piece, I think.
04:19:23 So let's go and 1078 escape limit.
04:19:29 So we've got a German 66
04:19:34 and Caesar clown.
04:19:35 They have formed neo-mads.
04:19:38 Yeah, I mean.
04:19:40 Neo-mads are two mad scientists together at last.
04:19:44 I think we could have gathered from the last one that they were going to team up, but OK.
04:19:48 I wonder what they're going to do.
04:19:51 Probably some mad science, if I had to guess.
04:19:59 Cool.
04:20:01 Well, I wonder how judge is going to react
04:20:04 to hearing that his son, Sanji, is in league with.
04:20:08 I saw.
04:20:11 For a while, I felt like we had too much Caesar clown.
04:20:13 I was kind of sick of Caesar clown for a while, but we haven't seen him in a bit.
04:20:18 So OK, yeah, yeah, bring him back.
04:20:20 Yeah, I mean, what was he?
04:20:22 He has been one of those consistent.
04:20:25 He was in punk.
04:20:26 He's been in like a lot of arcs.
04:20:27 Luffy. Luffy punched him and then law took his heart out
04:20:32 and he was a bargaining chip interest Rosa.
04:20:36 And then he continued with them, with law, I think,
04:20:41 as law still wanted him as a bargaining chip for some reason.
04:20:46 Like the thing that the thing that they wanted to trade him for didn't go through.
04:20:52 So he didn't trade him away.
04:20:55 So you got to keep him from trading away.
04:20:57 They ended up on a whole cake.
04:20:59 They ended up on a whole cake.
04:21:01 And I don't even know what, how he got there.
04:21:06 But he was involved with Capone gang, Beji.
04:21:10 And they had the the whole like big mom
04:21:13 assassination and Caesar is just like, I just want to go home.
04:21:17 I don't like this anymore.
04:21:21 Well, and now he did.
04:21:24 All right. He did.
04:21:26 Uncle Kizar is coming.
04:21:28 OK, you know, I'm just I'm just going to complain about Nate's complaints
04:21:32 because I watched him critique this chapter.
04:21:34 Nate doesn't like the the the the the the the diagram showing where people are.
04:21:40 He says they're he says their point.
04:21:45 They are a little hard to follow.
04:21:47 I think when when it's something big like the what's it called?
04:21:52 The big Skull Island in Wano.
04:21:56 Onigashima, it was very important.
04:21:59 I think the diagrams were extremely important in Wano.
04:22:01 You had to understand that the flying thing was going to crash into the other thing.
04:22:07 And you had to understand that like the lava was like, you know,
04:22:10 descending through floors and was going to hit the weapons, cash and detonate.
04:22:15 I yeah, I think it's more just to give you a grasp of the scale of the place
04:22:20 because you can't draw.
04:22:23 You can't draw like scene setting.
04:22:26 You can't waste time setting the scene every chapter.
04:22:29 You already know from the previous chapter that they're in a place.
04:22:32 But if you've forgotten, this is where they are.
04:22:34 And yeah, just give it like very quickly here, just in case you're confused.
04:22:40 And it is sometimes useful.
04:22:42 I don't really pay.
04:22:43 I don't really internalize them that much.
04:22:45 I mean, most of the time is like this building.
04:22:48 I can't remember which building is B, C or A.
04:22:51 I have no idea who is going from which place to which place or where everyone is.
04:22:56 They're just saying, during this scene, we're in this place.
04:23:00 And I guess it might be helpful later, but I don't hate it.
04:23:04 It's not doing much for me, particularly.
04:23:08 Sure, because everybody's walking around and.
04:23:13 Like on the map is not is not shown
04:23:17 where the seraphim have been fighting people.
04:23:22 Yeah, I don't really remember where everyone was.
04:23:25 I mean, it's true. I don't think about it like all the time.
04:23:30 But it probably is largely for people that are maybe a chapter behind or.
04:23:38 Just to just to just put a chapter behind you just read chapter.
04:23:41 I mean, just to establish that like these people are in separate locations that are related.
04:23:47 And then it's it's not really it's it's not always for knowing
04:23:53 it's not always for like getting a grasp of the whole situation for this.
04:23:56 I think it's just to show where these characters are without having to draw.
04:24:02 And then and then this next panel, this one of Stussy, Nate, Nate called this.
04:24:08 Can you believe he called this scuffed piece?
04:24:10 He said the line work was rough.
04:24:12 It was looking scuffed and we are in scuffed piece.
04:24:16 And like, it's fine. I mean, I fucking fine.
04:24:20 It is fine.
04:24:23 I I know what he means, though, over time,
04:24:27 Oda has obviously he's gotten older and maybe he's not as he's a bit looser.
04:24:32 If you go back to early chapters, it's a very much completely different style.
04:24:38 I think it looks.
04:24:40 Oh, you like the new. Yeah, I like the new as well.
04:24:42 I don't they don't bother me at all.
04:24:47 They they show you the thing.
04:24:49 That's how that's how it's got to be sometimes.
04:24:52 Sometimes it's just you got to get through
04:24:56 a panel of somebody talking on a thingy.
04:25:00 And it doesn't really matter if it's the most beautiful thing thing ever.
04:25:03 You want to save those moments for when you're doing like the big
04:25:07 the big reveals, the big punches.
04:25:11 OK, so.
04:25:12 And like, it's largely really good, even if it's a bit sloppy,
04:25:17 line art wise, compared to previous fine.
04:25:21 But it's got so much character, I say impression is wrong.
04:25:26 Well, sloppy in that it's like compared to previous one piece.
04:25:30 You know, lines don't always yeah, I connect.
04:25:33 There's some some some's like maybe the the pen is a bit thicker.
04:25:38 But like it's it's just it still has the character.
04:25:41 So that's been like it's been like this for a long time.
04:25:43 Like I literally I literally don't care and I literally don't understand
04:25:46 how someone could look at this and be like it looks worse than it used to
04:25:49 when the lines were cleaner, like I don't understand
04:25:53 feeling that way about the difference.
04:25:56 I yeah, I don't get it really.
04:25:59 I know that you can you can observe things,
04:26:02 but I don't know why you would get not even not even getting mad.
04:26:05 Just it to me, it looks better this way.
04:26:09 The the the the cleaness of the lines did not
04:26:13 make me did not impress me before, if anything.
04:26:17 I I would say that there's they're different.
04:26:19 I like old one piece as well.
04:26:22 I like an oil.
04:26:23 I'm I like I like scuffed piece.
04:26:26 I like it better.
04:26:31 I'm I'm I'm I'm reading.
04:26:33 So they're taking the government is taking the situation even more seriously
04:26:38 than Ohara. Yes, that's bad.
04:26:40 That's a bad sign.
04:26:42 They're going to do a super bomb.
04:26:43 Also, I forgot that Stussy was with Jim Bay
04:26:46 and we hadn't seen Jim Bay, I think.
04:26:47 So my my theory that it was to see with the gun, they're wrong.
04:26:52 Oh, Stussy, I don't know how to say it.
04:26:54 And I'm just going to say it wrong every time.
04:26:56 I it's got to be Stussy.
04:26:58 It's got to be Stussy.
04:27:00 Stussy, but then they say Luffy instead of Luffy.
04:27:03 So they so what are you what can be known, huh?
04:27:08 What can it possibly be?
04:27:09 That's you're right.
04:27:10 I mean, you're right. You're right. You're right.
04:27:13 I'm going to say Stussy until until I'm proven proven wrong.
04:27:17 Stussy, Factory A, Fabrio Stratum.
04:27:22 OK, I'm sorry.
04:27:24 I don't know if this is annoying, but to to to rag on Nate even more,
04:27:27 he got like in a previous page, this building was written with it was
04:27:33 spelled like F-A-B-I-R-I-O.
04:27:35 It was spelled Fiberio, but it's actually supposed to be called Fabrio.
04:27:39 And he spent like he spent like five minutes being like,
04:27:42 oh, Oda, Oda made a mistake.
04:27:44 What a goof. He put an extra I in the name.
04:27:47 I mean, it could be hidden by the little bit there.
04:27:52 Yeah, like there's a space for it right where the panel.
04:27:55 Well, the text, well, the text says Fabrio.
04:27:58 Yes, but that's translated and it's a fan translation.
04:28:01 So they may not have realized.
04:28:04 Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Yeah.
04:28:06 Yeah, I guess. Yeah, it could be.
04:28:08 Honestly, true.
04:28:11 It's one of those panel things where he does like a tiny sliver of a panel
04:28:15 to show that we're changing scene.
04:28:17 Yeah, changing scene or time is progressing.
04:28:22 Third or so.
04:28:24 Yeah, so Centimaru is here and from Stussy that.
04:28:29 Yeah, the CP zeros are a mission.
04:28:33 Was to eliminate the doctor.
04:28:36 And wait for the arrival of.
04:28:41 Wait for who's arrival, Kazaru, yes.
04:28:43 So the the the admiral.
04:28:47 And so Centimaru is like, OK, everybody,
04:28:50 all you little goofs and I don't even know who you are.
04:28:52 These little citizens, get out of here.
04:28:55 Save yourselves.
04:28:56 These random these random egghead citizens are awesome.
04:28:59 Yeah, I love I love in that they're all running away.
04:29:04 The the big robot in the back with the clockwork head.
04:29:08 Yeah, he's pretty good.
04:29:09 I think I like the little hooded guy down in the middle.
04:29:11 Also, yeah, the little hooded guy.
04:29:13 I mean, all of them, they're just so.
04:29:15 Yeah, yeah, they're great.
04:29:16 Nice little that that guy on the right.
04:29:18 I like I like the Phineas and Ferb guy over on the right.
04:29:21 Yeah, he is kind of like that.
04:29:25 Sexy lady in the front, she's very cute, you know.
04:29:29 If only it was so easy later sexy ladies
04:29:32 for me, then I could draw them all.
04:29:34 Oh, it doesn't even have to think about anything.
04:29:39 He's just brainless.
04:29:40 He's just drawing all this with no brain power.
04:29:42 Oh, oh, it just sneezes in a sexy big boob lady.
04:29:45 Just appears on this in a panel and he's like, that's not good enough.
04:29:49 That's a good power.
04:29:52 It's pretty good.
04:29:53 It's pretty good.
04:29:54 OK, so we flip over to third floor lab
04:29:57 building, see, no idea.
04:29:59 Sure, we got Frankie, who's not fully stoned.
04:30:04 He's only had a bit of that.
04:30:05 How did how did that happen?
04:30:07 He took a bite of stone stone.
04:30:09 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
04:30:10 How did he only become a half petrified?
04:30:12 How does that work?
04:30:13 I believe it's been shown to happen with her powers before.
04:30:16 I don't think it's like.
04:30:19 I don't know, though.
04:30:20 I don't know if it's like a her vision thing, like a Medusa or whether.
04:30:25 Like her beam is where you turn into stone, or whether if you see it,
04:30:30 your body turns into stone fully.
04:30:33 I'm not entirely sure how it works.
04:30:36 Maybe Frank is just resisting the cuteness.
04:30:39 He either was like, yeah, not fully taken in by the cuteness,
04:30:43 or maybe the beam just didn't fully hit him.
04:30:45 He's so big, you see.
04:30:47 He is quite large.
04:30:50 All right, so.
04:30:52 So Usob and Lilith are fucked.
04:30:56 They're just they're just they're just dead unless unless she reverts them, right?
04:31:01 That's the yeah, that's the state here.
04:31:03 I think so.
04:31:05 Yeah, it could be a thing in the future was like, oh, chopper,
04:31:08 you found a way to unstone if I people.
04:31:11 If I mean, if anyone can like reverse the effects of a fruit, what if like?
04:31:17 OK, crazy idea.
04:31:18 What if like Seastone could just reverse it?
04:31:21 I feel like that would have been tried before.
04:31:24 And it would have been known that that works.
04:31:27 I mean, if I'm thinking like a fruit did something, Seastone is what I would think
04:31:31 to like undo the effects of a fruit.
04:31:34 But yeah, it wouldn't necessarily wouldn't necessarily work.
04:31:37 It wouldn't work for every particular fruit, because like what if the fire fruit
04:31:42 or what if a set fire to something you couldn't put the fire out with Seastone?
04:31:46 You would just need water.
04:31:48 Yeah, yeah.
04:31:51 Well, it was just an idea.
04:31:54 But Vagapunk, I'm sure Vagapunk could probably come up with something.
04:31:56 Yeah, so.
04:31:58 Little guy, I forgot his name.
04:32:00 I think it's Pythagoras.
04:32:02 He says Pythagoras.
04:32:03 Little lemon gets fucking crushed to death.
04:32:06 This is the guy that he puts his head in like the big body, right?
04:32:10 Yeah. Yeah.
04:32:12 Poor little guy.
04:32:13 You snake.
04:32:14 Getting fucking killed.
04:32:15 So crush.
04:32:17 So Lilith is dead.
04:32:19 Pythagoras is seems to have been killed here.
04:32:23 Lilith is stone, Pythagoras crushed.
04:32:27 Wait, I said she doesn't fully stone him.
04:32:30 She just leaves him like that.
04:32:33 Well, she stops because she said somebody says wait.
04:32:37 Oh, it's not Frankie yelling.
04:32:40 Yeah. Well, somebody's saying wait, it could be Frankie.
04:32:42 It looks like she's walking away from this explosion.
04:32:45 Like I thought she crushed Pythagoras and that like caused the explosion.
04:32:48 And then she's walking away from it and Frankie is yelling like wait, wait.
04:32:52 But no, she's looking to the side.
04:32:54 It might think it's someone else.
04:32:55 That's a big explosion.
04:32:57 Yeah. Is that just is that from crushing Pythagoras?
04:33:00 I can only assume it's like one panel.
04:33:03 One panel gets crushed and then the other one explodes.
04:33:06 Yeah, I don't quite understand what's exploding, but I guess it's
04:33:11 guess it would explode immediately when her foot crushed him.
04:33:14 So she would be caught in the explosion and not walking away from it.
04:33:18 But a little confusing, a little weird.
04:33:21 Yeah, I get it.
04:33:22 Then we got Robin and Chopper and Big Lady.
04:33:28 What's her name?
04:33:29 I don't remember the big one.
04:33:31 Atlas Atlas. Yeah, there it is.
04:33:33 Well, all those they're they're hearing all about all of this death
04:33:38 and destruction that's happening.
04:33:39 And Robin's saying we should probably go and find the real Vega punk
04:33:44 because, you know, that's the that's important.
04:33:50 And so they will go.
04:33:51 And so I think they're going to Robin and Chopper are going to be the ones
04:33:55 fighting in that in that environment.
04:34:00 There's a room that's been sealed off for a while.
04:34:02 And I wrote it off since the place isn't useful.
04:34:04 OK, OK, so they're following Sanji's.
04:34:09 But they're following Nami's scream.
04:34:12 Because they think Sanji will go there, too.
04:34:14 And then no, no, no, no, they're saying that Nami will be fine
04:34:19 because Sanji will go to her.
04:34:20 We should instead focus on finding Vega punk.
04:34:23 And Atlas is like, oh, I think he could maybe be in this place.
04:34:26 And it's probably the right place.
04:34:28 Yeah. OK, so Brooke and Nami and Edison.
04:34:35 I don't remember. I don't even remember what Edison's deal.
04:34:37 Did they found they found him like this, right?
04:34:39 Because Edison got like jumped by someone.
04:34:42 I think so.
04:34:44 I think they found him busted up.
04:34:46 But they also were fighting the Jinbei Seraphim just then.
04:34:50 Oh, Nami used the cloud that she got from Big Mom.
04:34:54 I forget his name. I forget everyone's name.
04:34:56 There's too many names.
04:35:00 She zapped him and then Sanji is there
04:35:03 taking the punches, fighting him while they are thinking about stuff.
04:35:08 Brooke is going to go scout for Vega punk with his funny ghost ability.
04:35:14 So this so this bit of Sanji getting punched.
04:35:16 This is another thing that Nate spent a lot of time on
04:35:20 because his eyebrow is reversed.
04:35:25 Normal like like his normally his eyebrow curls at the bottom.
04:35:29 But here it curls at the top and apparently.
04:35:34 And apparently this is like confirmed in an SPS.
04:35:36 Apparently this means that like he's activating his germa powers.
04:35:42 It's like a germa. It's like, yeah, the like the left eyebrow.
04:35:46 OK, like, you know how the eyebrow that used to be covered
04:35:49 curls at the top and the and the one that's now uncovered curls at the bottom.
04:35:54 But the fact that it in this panel curling at the top
04:35:57 means that the eyebrow swirl direction has reversed.
04:35:59 And his eyebrows swirl the other way from his siblings.
04:36:03 But now it's gone the other way.
04:36:04 So now it's swirling the same way as the siblings.
04:36:06 So he's in like germa science mode. Apparently.
04:36:10 Is that something to be complaining about?
04:36:12 I thought that that means it makes sense.
04:36:14 They was a mistake.
04:36:15 Nate was complaining that he was looking at another panel.
04:36:19 I think the idea was that there was another panel where he did seem to be
04:36:23 using like germa science, but his eyebrow was not in reverse mode.
04:36:29 Yeah, one of them is a mistake.
04:36:32 I mean, I was just I was interested because apparently this is like a real thing
04:36:36 that's not bullshit and like it's in SPS's.
04:36:39 So this eyebrow swirl thing actually is real.
04:36:43 So I guess when he says it's the undying power of love, it's actually like.
04:36:48 I mean, everything everything he does is the power of love, right?
04:36:51 Yeah, because he's.
04:36:53 My I think it's he's like he didn't like his germa family connection and his power.
04:37:01 You didn't like using the funny capsule with the suit and the cape or whatever.
04:37:05 Yeah, but he is a super soldier.
04:37:09 So I guess he's like harnessing some of that power to get punched in the face
04:37:12 and not even doesn't look like he's using hacky.
04:37:14 I guess he might be so well.
04:37:17 So I'm sorry, remind me.
04:37:20 They said that like Sanji was the only one that didn't have superpowers,
04:37:24 but like he does have superpowers, right?
04:37:27 He can't. Yeah.
04:37:28 Yes, they call him a failure because he had too many emotions, I think.
04:37:32 The other ones were more emotionless and violent.
04:37:35 But because Sanji loved his mother and his mother was nice,
04:37:39 that he was like he's the freak and maybe he's like the half super kid.
04:37:45 So he's got some latent powers, but he's more of a human than his siblings.
04:37:51 A pair of parents aren't shown to be like totally like inhumane either.
04:37:56 They have the girl.
04:37:58 The girl has emotions.
04:38:00 Yeah, so it's not even like it's a it's a true thing that they're like robots.
04:38:04 Yeah, so she just doesn't like being nasty.
04:38:08 Apparently, the eyebrow swirl direction is like a is some kind of tell with that.
04:38:14 So that's interesting, never picked up on that before.
04:38:19 All right, yes, Zoro and Luffy Zoro, Luffy fighting Kuma.
04:38:25 We're weird little baby Kuma.
04:38:28 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
04:38:31 And Hawkeye and Hawkeye, but he's gone.
04:38:34 He's reprioritized the order of his targets.
04:38:36 He's going after the weaker straw hats to demoralize the stronger ones.
04:38:42 Divious, devious.
04:38:46 Yes, so Zoro and Kaku have to go stop Hawkeye,
04:38:51 which is, I mean, makes sense.
04:38:53 They're already like paired up against that guy.
04:38:57 So now it's the two strong and the other two strong with swords going off
04:39:00 to the guy with swords and the other guy is going to kind of I kind of feel
04:39:03 like this actually puts the odds more in their favor.
04:39:05 I don't know.
04:39:06 I feel like a one on I feel like a two on one fight is more unbalanced.
04:39:10 Two two on one fights is better for the two than than the one two and one one four
04:39:17 on two fight. Yeah. Yeah, because you can do pincer attacks.
04:39:20 You can do strategic maneuvers, you see.
04:39:25 It is funny also that Luffy calls Kaku Usopp because of his nose.
04:39:29 Oh, I didn't mean I didn't even catch that.
04:39:33 Quick, go get him, I didn't even notice.
04:39:35 Lol, that's good.
04:39:39 All right, so Luffy's punching Luchi said, you can't just punch him.
04:39:44 Doesn't matter how many times you try hitting it, that won't work.
04:39:47 And it looks like it's not true.
04:39:50 It's I guess I mean, it's he's definitely he's definitely recoiling
04:39:53 from the blows, maybe he's not doing any real damage.
04:39:57 Yeah, if nothing else, he's getting interrupted so we can't be doing anything.
04:40:02 Yeah. OK, and then we've got.
04:40:06 Only one only one day remains before the famous egghead incident.
04:40:11 However, this is funny.
04:40:12 This is like the first future tense.
04:40:15 Like, yeah, what you're reading right now is going to be so big
04:40:19 in a few days. Is is that what that is that like a narration?
04:40:23 Or is that like her memory?
04:40:25 Like in the is that memory she's experiencing in the Kuma bubble?
04:40:30 No, I think we're just looking at Bonnie to see where she is.
04:40:33 She's crying. Yeah. Yeah.
04:40:35 And and it's not about her this narration.
04:40:39 It's about the egghead incident.
04:40:40 It's very strange.
04:40:41 It's very strange for the narration to just come up with.
04:40:43 Yeah, a big important thing called the egghead incident is happening one day from now.
04:40:49 But let's go back.
04:40:50 But for now, let's journey back into the past.
04:40:53 I think, yeah, it's maybe odd phrasing, but it's really just how do we get here?
04:40:59 And that's yeah, yeah, that's what they get to.
04:41:03 So marriage war and they're getting
04:41:06 marriage war is getting the the the the call from a head about the void century.
04:41:14 Dr.
04:41:15 Vega Punk is reaching the void century.
04:41:17 OK, this is the informant.
04:41:18 This is the trader informing the CP five agents were dispatched.
04:41:24 They didn't learn anything.
04:41:28 And the ships were attacked.
04:41:32 And so.
04:41:35 They send more agents and then it is turned into a big thing.
04:41:41 I wonder about this, because like.
04:41:44 I suppose the idea for this traitor is to, excuse me, I need a I need a water right now.
04:41:51 Oh, I have to pee.
04:41:53 You know what?
04:41:54 I mean, let's let's take a quick break.
04:41:56 One second.
04:41:58 Seltzer, pure Aqua Seltzer, very flavorful.
04:42:02 Yeah.
04:42:04 So.
04:42:05 So as I was saying, I'll say what I was saying again.
04:42:09 So CP five agents were dispatched.
04:42:11 And then their ship vanished and we know they ended up in a pod and then more agents were sent
04:42:16 and they also ended up in the same pod, starving to death.
04:42:22 Now, the reason for doing that, I wasn't sure at first, but now I guess the point is to escalate
04:42:28 the the mystery for the government if the agents are disappearing.
04:42:34 Because if you just say, Dr.
04:42:36 Vega Punk is researching the void century.
04:42:39 So anonymous informant, the government sends agents, they find nothing.
04:42:43 They go back.
04:42:44 They say there was nothing there.
04:42:45 Seen fine.
04:42:46 Right.
04:42:47 Maybe they maybe they think, oh, it's just a prank call.
04:42:49 It's just that it's not a real thing.
04:42:53 So you think the trader specifically kidnapped them so that they would send more powerful
04:42:59 agents?
04:43:00 Yes, I think that makes that does make sense.
04:43:03 Yeah.
04:43:04 Yes.
04:43:06 And eventually they got to talk to the Gorosei, totally exposing the full extent of the genius
04:43:14 scientist's treachery.
04:43:17 So they decided upon the assassination Cypher Cypher Paul Zero was sent and then the five
04:43:28 elders anticipated that Vega Punk would resist.
04:43:31 They said one of their own escorted by Admiral Kizaru, this is this is weird as talking in
04:43:37 past tense about the present.
04:43:40 It is weird.
04:43:41 Yeah.
04:43:42 Well, I mean, they sent them this this was the this.
04:43:45 This is how the decision was made to do this.
04:43:48 So it did happen a little while ago, a little while.
04:43:52 They also reinforced the fleet.
04:43:54 They deployed with backup from several naval broncers.
04:43:57 I like some of these designs are like the long beard guy.
04:44:00 We saw that guy.
04:44:02 We definitely saw that guy before.
04:44:03 I commented on that guy in like a previous chapter.
04:44:07 He was like standing.
04:44:08 I think he was like with the Gorosei or with Kizaru and I was like, who the fuck's that
04:44:11 guy?
04:44:12 So he's cool.
04:44:13 Yeah.
04:44:14 He does look cool.
04:44:15 And the many chins man.
04:44:18 Is that a fish man?
04:44:19 I think that's a fish man.
04:44:20 That's gotta be that's gotta be a fish man.
04:44:22 The caution level was raised to total war imminent.
04:44:25 So this is so like weeks ago when I was saying, wow.
04:44:29 So everything's going well.
04:44:31 They're just going to get Vega Punk and leave.
04:44:33 So easy.
04:44:35 Nothing's going to go wrong.
04:44:37 Right.
04:44:38 Yeah, they're not.
04:44:39 How could it possibly continue?
04:44:40 And they seem, of course, they seem intent on pressing the issue.
04:44:44 Yeah.
04:44:45 Then the sudden unexpected appearance of Emperor Straw Hat Luffy's shit.
04:44:49 Look at these.
04:44:50 Look at these simple clouds.
04:44:51 Look at these cartoony clouds behind.
04:44:53 This is scuffed piece.
04:44:54 You know what Nate's right.
04:44:55 It's comic sucks.
04:44:57 Wait, which where?
04:44:58 Oh, and the one of the going Mary.
04:45:02 You mean the sunny go?
04:45:04 Is it not called the going Mary?
04:45:06 That's the first one.
04:45:08 The sunny.
04:45:09 Yeah, the sunny go.
04:45:10 No, you're right.
04:45:11 Thousand sunny.
04:45:12 The thousand sunny.
04:45:13 Yes.
04:45:14 Just look at there's no no tone, no tone in the sky, no shading on the clouds, scuffed
04:45:20 piece.
04:45:21 Yeah, but they it's only looks good.
04:45:25 It's fine.
04:45:26 It could have used a little it could have used a little screen tone.
04:45:29 It could have used a little depth, but it's OK.
04:45:32 It's fine.
04:45:33 It's fine.
04:45:34 I'm not mad.
04:45:35 I'm not mad.
04:45:36 I'm not mad.
04:45:37 I like that.
04:45:38 I don't really think of the Straw Hats as like an emperor like a Luffy's an emperor.
04:45:43 Yeah.
04:45:44 Did they declare him one when the that the last yes, Morgan declared him one after the
04:45:51 events of whole cake.
04:45:52 I think.
04:45:53 Does he get to decide that?
04:45:54 Is that his job?
04:45:55 Well, I think there's no like official status.
04:45:58 It's not like.
04:45:59 Oh, it's not like the Shichi Bukai, which was like an official government job.
04:46:03 It's an official government thing.
04:46:04 And it's not like anything in particular.
04:46:06 It's just like who is who is considered the biggest, baddest pirate in the entire world.
04:46:10 Yeah.
04:46:11 The emperors.
04:46:12 So I guess Big News Morgan does get to decide that because he fucking he controls the narrative
04:46:17 and he thought, wouldn't it be fucking funny if this happened?
04:46:20 Yeah.
04:46:21 Yeah.
04:46:22 Yeah.
04:46:23 Lamal.
04:46:24 So now after the events of one, oh, they know Luffy has the the whatever fruit and the Nica
04:46:31 fruit and they're like, they they're looking at him more like with a, oh, we thought you
04:46:36 were just a rubber boy, but actually you're you're a protagonist, but actually you're
04:46:39 a joy for you're a joy boy.
04:46:41 Oh, you ate the joy.
04:46:42 You ate the joy.
04:46:43 Joy fruit.
04:46:44 Yeah.
04:46:45 Yeah.
04:46:46 Should have called it.
04:46:47 Should have called it the joy.
04:46:48 Joy fruit.
04:46:50 Yes.
04:46:51 He does laugh a lot.
04:46:52 So maybe it is.
04:46:53 Sorry.
04:46:54 Is it the is it the is it the hito hito no me Nica model?
04:46:59 It's not the Nica Nica fruit, right?
04:47:01 It's the hito hito no me model Nica.
04:47:05 I forget.
04:47:06 I'm almost positive that that is hito hito no me.
04:47:09 It's the same.
04:47:10 It's man.
04:47:11 Human human.
04:47:12 It's the same as a Sengoku hito hito no me model Daibutsu.
04:47:16 Yes.
04:47:17 Yeah.
04:47:18 You got the you got the different models.
04:47:19 You got Nica.
04:47:20 You got Buddha.
04:47:21 And you got Chopper.
04:47:22 You got the normal normal guy, the most powerful of all.
04:47:27 What a funny fruit.
04:47:28 So many different forms.
04:47:29 Yeah.
04:47:30 It's like cool.
04:47:31 If you think about like the idea that it's it's a devil fruit so like evolution and and
04:47:38 all that.
04:47:39 It's like they've humans have gone on to land.
04:47:42 They left the sea behind.
04:47:44 Yeah.
04:47:45 And one of the devil fruits evolution is just man.
04:47:47 Maybe it's like the first devil fruit.
04:47:49 Well, didn't we didn't in an SPSO to say that if a human ate the hito hito no me, it would
04:47:54 turn them into like the ideal version of themself.
04:47:58 That's funny.
04:47:59 Yeah.
04:48:00 It's it's it is very funny though that like there's a bunch of different hito.
04:48:05 I assume other if there are more hito hito no means they are other forms of like legendary
04:48:11 person or God type.
04:48:13 Yeah.
04:48:14 God type people.
04:48:15 But then there's one that's just a good that's just guy.
04:48:17 It's just a guy.
04:48:18 Normal guy.
04:48:19 But an ideal guy like a really a really cool guy though.
04:48:22 If you eat it, you become a really cool type guy, not just not just any guy, but but still
04:48:27 a guy.
04:48:29 So the government is like what straw hat?
04:48:32 That's an important character.
04:48:35 This chain of events is going to culminate tomorrow and the outcome will shock the world.
04:48:40 Wow.
04:48:41 Spoilers.
04:48:42 Wow.
04:48:43 Will be surprised and delighted.
04:48:46 Will be shocked by what we see amazing.
04:48:49 So I for one can't wait to turn the page and learn more.
04:48:55 So we finish with the shaka shot through the head.
04:49:00 Reveal.
04:49:01 Brutal.
04:49:02 Fucking brutal.
04:49:03 Yes.
04:49:04 This helmet's just cracked open his blood.
04:49:07 He's not alive anymore.
04:49:09 He seems to be dead.
04:49:11 Seems fully dead.
04:49:13 Vegapunk.
04:49:14 Why are you doing this?
04:49:17 Slide.
04:49:18 And here we go.
04:49:19 It's Stella.
04:49:20 I mean, it's not Stella.
04:49:22 It's York.
04:49:23 York.
04:49:24 It's the foodie.
04:49:25 You know what?
04:49:26 Yeah.
04:49:27 Okay.
04:49:28 So she's doing she's the trader because she wants to be a celestial dragon and you know,
04:49:34 it kind of make.
04:49:35 Okay.
04:49:36 I guess she I wonder if like they offered it to her like they'd make her a celestial
04:49:41 dragon if she did this, but it makes sense because she's gluttonous.
04:49:46 And like the thing about being a celestial dragon is you just get anything you want.
04:49:49 You're just a spoiled piece of shit.
04:49:51 She's like, I want that.
04:49:52 She fits the bill, I guess.
04:49:54 Yeah.
04:49:55 For the mindset.
04:49:56 She just wants to eat and play video games.
04:49:58 Just just like that guy, Luffy punched.
04:50:01 She wants to be that guy.
04:50:05 You know, this is this is this is yet another time where Sanji's cooking could save the
04:50:11 for her sense.
04:50:12 You could make her a big sandwich and then she would eat and be like, ah, you know what?
04:50:16 I don't need to be a celestial dragon.
04:50:18 You know what?
04:50:19 I want to join your crew and eat your food.
04:50:20 This is fine.
04:50:21 Actually.
04:50:22 Yeah.
04:50:23 True.
04:50:24 Yeah.
04:50:25 True.
04:50:26 Hey.
04:50:27 Okay.
04:50:28 So why did he not know that she was doing this?
04:50:33 Doesn't he know it?
04:50:34 Doesn't he know everything she knows?
04:50:36 I get.
04:50:37 Well, as we were saying last time.
04:50:39 There must be some way.
04:50:40 I was.
04:50:41 I was talking about like how it could be shaka before he got shot like two weeks ago.
04:50:46 Yeah.
04:50:47 And they don't seem to have like a connected hive mind.
04:50:51 They seem to be able to transfer data through the big brain, the big egg.
04:50:57 So in what sense is this Vega punk at all?
04:51:01 Because this is the person who poops all of Vega Punks poop.
04:51:05 Yeah.
04:51:06 And eats all of the food, I guess.
04:51:08 I guess.
04:51:10 I guess.
04:51:12 But here's one thing.
04:51:13 Here's one thing I don't get.
04:51:15 I'm pretty sure Stella, I mean York was the one who was turned into stone and blown to pieces earlier.
04:51:22 What?
04:51:23 Like in the last chapter?
04:51:25 No, no, no.
04:51:26 A few chapters ago when they first meet Hancock.
04:51:28 Let me find the chapter.
04:51:32 But like it was Lilith and it was Usok.
04:51:36 Yeah.
04:51:37 And half of Franky.
04:51:38 And York was there.
04:51:39 What?
04:51:40 York got turned to stone and smashed and then they fell down off the bridge.
04:51:46 And I'm just going to check that that is the person that that happened to.
04:51:50 All right.
04:51:51 Because I can't think of who else it was.
04:51:53 Yeah, show me that.
04:51:54 That seems weird.
04:51:56 And I'm like, okay, if that was the case, let me just find it first.
04:52:00 1075.
04:52:03 When do we find it?
04:52:05 They're walking around.
04:52:07 Yeah.
04:52:08 So York is in 1075.
04:52:10 She is with Franky, Lilith, Usok, and they find Pythagoras's head.
04:52:17 He's just walking around.
04:52:19 And then yes, here we go.
04:52:23 I guess for spoiler reasons, I'll DM it to you.
04:52:26 Go for it.
04:52:30 But yeah, this page, she gets turned.
04:52:33 This is York.
04:52:34 She gets turned into stone.
04:52:35 Huh.
04:52:36 Yeah, she did.
04:52:37 And then in that chapter, I just I'll link the chapter, I guess.
04:52:44 In that chapter, Boa Hancock uses her BMU to explode everything.
04:52:52 But I guess we don't see.
04:52:54 Let me look at this.
04:52:55 Do we see her turned into rubble?
04:52:59 Into rubble, rubble, rubble, rubble.
04:53:03 Okay.
04:53:04 See York.
04:53:06 She's saying she's yawning, walking around.
04:53:10 And then I didn't order, Edison, order you to hold your horses earlier.
04:53:14 You should really still be waiting out there, even though you're so cute.
04:53:19 Hmm.
04:53:20 Turns to stone.
04:53:23 And then she's kicked, kicked to the side.
04:53:27 See what I thought was that she blew her up and killed him.
04:53:31 Oh yeah, she kicks to the side.
04:53:34 Yeah, I don't see her being killed or exploded.
04:53:39 She blows up the bridge and they all fall down.
04:53:42 So I guess it's not like a problem.
04:53:46 It's just that we don't, we may have assumed that she blew up York during that.
04:53:50 But she didn't.
04:53:51 York is still up there, made a stone.
04:53:53 I got it.
04:53:54 Hancock turned her back out of stone and then jumped down to fight everyone as York left
04:53:59 to kill Shaka.
04:54:00 I did not think that being turned to stone was like a real, the last time we were going
04:54:07 to see York or anything like that.
04:54:09 So.
04:54:10 I mean, I read that situation as York being killed and I thought, oh shit, they're going
04:54:15 to start killing these mega punk characters.
04:54:18 That's interesting.
04:54:19 They're semi disposable as characters.
04:54:22 At no point have I ever been under the impression that like being turned to stone by Hancock
04:54:27 is like you're dead.
04:54:29 Well, no, no, neither do I, but like I thought that she exploded her afterwards.
04:54:34 Oh, true.
04:54:35 Oh yeah.
04:54:36 I guess I didn't.
04:54:37 I guess I just wasn't paying attention.
04:54:41 No, I don't know.
04:54:42 I didn't think they were going to.
04:54:43 I didn't think they'd be killing these guys off with like, nah.
04:54:48 But what happened to little Pythagoras?
04:54:50 Well, she stepped on his head.
04:54:51 What's that explosion?
04:54:52 Yeah, that I don't know.
04:54:55 I guess she just made an explosion.
04:54:58 She may have done an explosion in between panels.
04:55:02 Yeah, I think she just did an explosion.
04:55:05 She crushed Pythagoras, did an explosion.
04:55:08 I guess the idea being that she was exploding Usopp and Lilith and maybe Frankie killing
04:55:15 them behind her.
04:55:17 But I mean, I'm sure they're not actually dead.
04:55:19 Yeah, we didn't see them explode.
04:55:24 So I don't really think any, I mean, some of these guys might die.
04:55:31 Maybe Shaka's really dead.
04:55:32 I don't know.
04:55:33 I feel like Shaka could be dead.
04:55:37 Yeah, yeah, shot through the head.
04:55:41 And what do we need all these vagabunks for anyway?
04:55:44 Yeah, the idea they were all going to join the straw hats together.
04:55:49 There's a lot of characters.
04:55:51 Wait a minute.
04:55:53 Do you think one of these vagabunks is going to join the straw hats?
04:55:59 Well, I thought the idea was vagabunk was going to travel with the straw hats to get
04:56:03 that information that he has.
04:56:05 Yeah, but that's not the same as joining the straw hats.
04:56:08 Well, no, I don't think anyone's going to join the straw hats from this.
04:56:13 Although they're going to travel with them.
04:56:16 I mean, you say that and I agree, but at the same time that gets me thinking like,
04:56:20 what if this whole thing plays out and like most of these vagabunks end up dead,
04:56:26 but like one of them stays alive and they just become a new crew member
04:56:30 and they're the crew scientist.
04:56:32 Well, I guess the Frankie's already the crew scientist.
04:56:34 He's the engineer.
04:56:36 He can build stuff.
04:56:37 He is a good vagabunk.
04:56:39 Honestly, honestly, I could see that.
04:56:41 I could see that.
04:56:42 I could see that maybe happening.
04:56:44 Maybe like they all die except Lilith and then Lilith just joins or something
04:56:49 and just is a permanent member or something like that.
04:56:51 It doesn't sound that crazy.
04:56:53 Yeah, it could be.
04:56:54 Lilith is cute and it is the one of I mean, a lot of one piece ladies are very cute
04:57:02 in the same way that they could easily add to the Nami Rubin.
04:57:07 Cute girls on the straw hat crew thing gets all the fans going.
04:57:14 Fans love it.
04:57:15 The fans love it when there's a cute girl on screen.
04:57:17 I sure do.
04:57:21 What if we got Pythagoras?
04:57:22 What if we got little ball Pythagoras who joins the crew?
04:57:27 I actually would.
04:57:28 Yeah, that's pretty cute.
04:57:29 Little Pythagoras.
04:57:30 That's different.
04:57:34 I don't see it just because these vagabunks,
04:57:39 I think they're going to stay with vagabunk.
04:57:42 However, along he remains relevant to the straw hats, pirates.
04:57:46 I'm imagining now like this plays out that like maybe Stella dies
04:57:51 and most of the other vagabunks die and maybe there's just one left
04:57:55 and he joins the crew.
04:57:58 I think that sounds plausible.
04:58:01 And it's like, hey guys, technically vagabunk.
04:58:03 Certainly they will travel with the straw hats to escape.
04:58:05 Oh, I mean, yeah, certainly they'll travel with vagabunk.
04:58:08 Yeah, certainly they'll leave with a vagabunk.
04:58:12 Joining the crew, it doesn't mean so much as it used to
04:58:16 because like a carrot was with the crew for so long
04:58:20 and she ended up leaving.
04:58:22 Yamato could have joined the crew, but he was like,
04:58:25 I'm just going to stay in one of for a little while
04:58:29 and they've got all those allies.
04:58:32 They've got those frenemies.
04:58:34 They've got people out in the sea doing their own thing.
04:58:37 The crew itself, I think, is quite good at where it is.
04:58:42 Yeah.
04:58:44 I think we're getting nearer to the end than to the beginning now.
04:58:51 I foresee a scenario in which maybe at least one of these vagabunks
04:58:56 become like a permanent fixture on the ship for however,
04:59:01 as they make their final journey to Raftel or whatever.
04:59:07 Yeah, maybe.
04:59:10 I mean, even Jinbei felt like a bit of a weird addition
04:59:14 because he already had a crew and he had to say goodbye to them
04:59:18 to join the Straw Hat.
04:59:19 Yeah.
04:59:20 And it was just sort of weird.
04:59:21 Yeah, he already had a good crew and they were cool.
04:59:24 He could have been one of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.
04:59:27 He could have been a responsible ally.
04:59:29 That's what I would have assumed he would do, but I guess that's...
04:59:32 But he joined the crew because I think there was expectations.
04:59:37 I don't even think that was...
04:59:39 They've got to have a helmsman give.
04:59:44 I don't...
04:59:45 A ship without a helmsman.
04:59:47 That always felt like an excuse to give him a reason to join
04:59:55 because he didn't have a lot of other reasons to join.
04:59:58 Other than that, he's...
04:59:59 It's not like he was at rock bottom.
05:00:00 Other than that, he's their friend.
05:00:01 And they like him.
05:00:02 Yeah, and he's a strong guy and he wants to help them.
05:00:04 He has his own crew.
05:00:05 That's the thing that's meaning...
05:00:07 The fact that he has his own crew means they have to invent a role
05:00:11 that he has to do on the Straw Hat ship, which was always a bit funny.
05:00:14 Yeah, it's dumb.
05:00:19 And I think the expectation that the Straw Hat crew grows over time.
05:00:22 I'm just racist and I just don't think that we should mix crew.
05:00:24 I just don't think we should mix racist and crew, okay?
05:00:26 I wanted him to join us just a big fish.
05:00:28 Humans only.
05:00:29 I think that would have been fine.
05:00:30 And Chopper counts because he ate the human.
05:00:33 He's like strong.
05:00:35 What?
05:00:37 Did you not hear what I said?
05:00:39 I was rambling.
05:00:41 Oh, I just said I wanted him to join us as a big fish
05:00:44 and I think that would have been fine.
05:00:46 He just needed to be a strong guy on the crew.
05:00:48 And now he's like an addition to their intimidation factor.
05:00:52 And he can do all of the things that require swimming
05:00:55 because nobody can really do that except Zoro and Sandy.
05:00:59 Yeah, Jimi.
05:01:00 Yeah, true.
05:01:02 But like the idea that the Straw Hat crew grows in member
05:01:07 is it's sort of.
05:01:10 It's gotten to capacity, I think for the amount of screen time
05:01:15 you can give to each one of them.
05:01:17 I don't think there's enough.
05:01:21 I feel like if you weren't there by the time skip,
05:01:24 it's like that was the crew.
05:01:27 The crew that got separated at the time skip
05:01:30 and then reassembled and got back together two years later.
05:01:33 Like that's the crew.
05:01:34 Jimi is also here now and that's cool.
05:01:38 But but come on.
05:01:39 Yeah, come on.
05:01:40 It's one of those things because it's like the way they joined
05:01:44 the crew earlier was like more emotional and more serious
05:01:50 because they were so small in number.
05:01:52 They needed everyone they could get.
05:01:56 And it's not even about like needing them.
05:01:58 It's just sort of the characters they had
05:02:03 really needed the Straw Hat Pirates.
05:02:06 Yeah, Jimi didn't need the Straw Hats.
05:02:10 Like Brooke, his crew was dead and he finally has.
05:02:14 He's the most recent one.
05:02:16 He has such a sad story of like sailing on this boat for whoever,
05:02:22 who knows how long living as a skeleton because of a devil fruit he ate.
05:02:26 Yeah.
05:02:27 And all of his crew is dead and he's just he hasn't met anyone in a long time.
05:02:31 Yeah.
05:02:32 Yeah, they rescued him from a real good thing.
05:02:34 And his shadow was, yeah, they got his shadow back for him
05:02:39 and they were friends and Luffy was just asking,
05:02:41 you want to come with us?
05:02:42 He was like, oh my God, a crew?
05:02:44 Oh, I'd love to.
05:02:45 It was like, it's so cute.
05:02:49 And that, you know, it's the same with everyone.
05:02:54 Pretty much, yeah.
05:02:55 They're all like crying at the chance to join the Straw Hat Zoro.
05:02:59 Zoro's like, yeah, fucking whatever.
05:03:01 I mean, Zoro's the first one.
05:03:03 When it's him and Luffy, it's just like, yeah, let's team up.
05:03:05 Cool.
05:03:06 All right, let's go.
05:03:07 Let's team up.
05:03:08 I mean, he smirks and he makes the same.
05:03:11 He's like, well, if I'm going to be the strongest swordsman,
05:03:14 the only one I can serve under is the Pirate King.
05:03:17 So you better, you better become that, I guess.
05:03:20 All right, cool.
05:03:21 Let's go.
05:03:22 Yeah.
05:03:23 And that's very Zoro.
05:03:25 And then things like.
05:03:27 How fucked up would it be if Zoro like wept tears
05:03:31 and he's like, finally a family?
05:03:35 Yeah.
05:03:36 Yeah, it doesn't have to be a big emotional thing,
05:03:38 but the thing is they made it such a big deal
05:03:43 that Jim Bay was joining the crew as well.
05:03:45 Jim Bay did get emotional.
05:03:48 Sure.
05:03:49 Whatever.
05:03:50 I think it's, it just, it wouldn't have made sense
05:03:53 if Zoro didn't have any reason to leave whatever group he was in.
05:03:56 Zoro was by himself.
05:03:57 Yeah.
05:03:58 So it's like, sure, sure.
05:03:59 Yeah.
05:04:00 Sanji left his kitchen because he wanted to find all blue
05:04:02 and he's very emotional about that.
05:04:06 And Robin had our whole thing where she.
05:04:09 She was in Baroque Works.
05:04:12 She joined because she wasn't going to stay with Baroque Works.
05:04:15 Baroque Works, she was a double agent for them.
05:04:19 She's trying to learn about the pony glyphs and stuff.
05:04:23 And then later, you know, she, she sort of,
05:04:29 her past catches up to her and it's like a whole thing to get her back.
05:04:32 It's like, you're a friend of ours.
05:04:33 And it's like, oh my God.
05:04:35 Oh, thanks guys.
05:04:38 Thanks guys for saving me.
05:04:41 And then Usopp had the whole thing where he joined just to see the world.
05:04:47 And then he forged in fire.
05:04:49 They're strong bound in, in Watcher 7.
05:04:53 When he was, he was going to leave because they were going to get rid of the ship
05:04:56 because it was no longer.
05:04:58 I'm getting chills.
05:04:59 I'm getting chills just thinking about it.
05:05:00 Oh, what a battle.
05:05:02 What, what a battle.
05:05:06 And God, what a seven.
05:05:08 Annie's Lobby is the coolest.
05:05:10 I love it so much.
05:05:13 It's my favorite arc.
05:05:14 Annie's Lobby is the, no, I'm thinking of Impel Down.
05:05:18 Water 7 is Frankie and Puffing Tom and the big going Mary.
05:05:22 What happened to Annie's, what happened to Annie's Lobby?
05:05:26 They saved Niko Robin from Niko's computer.
05:05:28 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
05:05:29 Right, of course.
05:05:32 And then the, the Zabusta call was activated by accident by Spandam
05:05:37 because he's an idiot.
05:05:38 Right, right.
05:05:39 Wait, which one is Spandam's the guy with like half a face, right?
05:05:44 Yeah, he didn't used to have half a face, but now he does.
05:05:46 He's been punched and kicked so much.
05:05:48 Oh, good for him.
05:05:49 And he was.
05:05:50 That's character development.
05:05:51 Real, real busted.
05:05:52 Is he like friends with Kobe now?
05:05:55 No, I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of acting.
05:05:58 You're thinking of Helmapo.
05:05:59 I'm thinking of Helmapo.
05:06:00 Yeah, I am.
05:06:02 Who's Axe Hand Morgan's son, right?
05:06:04 Am I?
05:06:05 Yes.
05:06:07 He's still out there.
05:06:08 I hope he comes back.
05:06:09 Yeah, we saw him.
05:06:10 He finds the one piece.
05:06:11 In some like, in some like intro panel.
05:06:14 I remember there's like one, remember, remember Axe Hand Morgan?
05:06:17 Boy, that guy should, that guy should seem like a big deal back in the day.
05:06:22 Huh, weird.
05:06:23 Yeah.
05:06:24 Anyway, let's get back to the grand line.
05:06:29 And like, yeah.
05:06:30 So they're all characters who had nowhere to go except the straw hats.
05:06:36 And, you know, straw hats is something they needed.
05:06:40 Jim Bae just sees Luffy as like, he's the future pirate king.
05:06:44 Yeah.
05:06:45 But also, I gotta be their Helmsman.
05:06:47 I just gotta.
05:06:48 Is he there as like an envoy from the fishmen to like serve under the pirate king as like
05:06:55 a show of unity between races?
05:06:58 Is that the idea?
05:06:59 I don't think that's got anything to do with it.
05:07:01 It's just, it's just personal like loyalty to Luffy.
05:07:04 He sees Luffy as the person who will liberate the world and save and be the coolest guy
05:07:10 ever.
05:07:11 It's probably true.
05:07:12 And so he wants to help him in his quest and he will join his crew.
05:07:14 Okay.
05:07:15 I mean, that's all reasonable enough.
05:07:16 It's not the worst thing ever.
05:07:17 It's all makes enough sense, I guess.
05:07:20 Yeah.
05:07:21 It would make more sense if he didn't have a crew of his own.
05:07:23 We've been, we've said this before.
05:07:25 It seems more reasonable that he would become part of the grand fleet, but you know, he would
05:07:32 be, you know, a very, a very honored, very honored and esteemed member of the grand fleet
05:07:38 of the straw hats and, you know, part of their personal envoy to the fishmen would have made
05:07:44 perfect sense.
05:07:45 But we could do this too, I guess.
05:07:46 Sure.
05:07:47 Leave your crew, Jinbe.
05:07:48 I guess in the sense that some pirates, Jinbe's old crew are going to be part of the grand
05:07:52 fleet for Luffy, ultimately.
05:07:55 I mean, I guess we see, I guess this is kind of how like, like whitebeard's crew is all
05:07:59 the same.
05:08:00 I'm probably supposed to imagine that all the people in Whitebeard's crew, they were either,
05:08:05 they probably used to belong to their own teams or maybe they were even captains of
05:08:10 their own fleets or ships before and like, still to a certain extent, like they command
05:08:16 loyalty among those other ships that like, are not maybe technically part of Whitebeard's
05:08:22 fleet, but because they have loyalty to the captain that is like Whitebeard's guy.
05:08:26 Yeah.
05:08:27 See.
05:08:28 They have a connection there.
05:08:29 See, that would be cool.
05:08:31 Like if it's Luffy is so influential now that captains of fleets can just join him if he
05:08:37 asks them to.
05:08:38 But that's the thing.
05:08:39 You don't think he, did he ask Jinbe to join?
05:08:43 He did, right?
05:08:44 Kind of don't remember the specifics.
05:08:47 I don't think it was, I don't think it was clear enough.
05:08:49 I think it was like, I'll join you, but I just got to be like five or six arcs later.
05:08:55 He said he had to do something and then if he succeeded in his mission, he would join
05:08:58 their crew and then he finally got back from that and he's like, well, time to complete
05:09:02 that arc.
05:09:03 It looks like I'm joining now.
05:09:04 It was Big Mom.
05:09:05 He has like ties to Big Mom and that was the whole cake, I think, after that.
05:09:10 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
05:09:13 And then he appeared in Wano and he's like, I'm going to join, did you miss me?
05:09:21 I'm sorry, Jinbe just doesn't feel like part of the family.
05:09:25 Not yet.
05:09:26 Never.
05:09:28 Never have a filthy fish man.
05:09:29 I'll never call one brother.
05:09:32 But like with all that said, with all that said, who like, I think the idea that a vagabunk,
05:09:42 the last remaining vagabunk will stay with a straw hat crew because there's nowhere else
05:09:47 to go.
05:09:48 That means that makes a lot of sense in the same way that someone like Brooke is like,
05:09:54 my old crew is gone.
05:09:55 Yeah.
05:09:57 I've lost everything else.
05:09:59 And now, yeah, you've brought me out of what was a terrible fate.
05:10:03 And yeah, if all the vagabunks got killed, except for Pythagoras and Pagoras, like now
05:10:07 what do I do?
05:10:08 Oh, no, I'm just a little robot with all the knowledge in the universe.
05:10:11 Like, well, why don't you come to Raftel with us?
05:10:15 Yay.
05:10:16 Hooray.
05:10:17 I will.
05:10:18 Thank you, father.
05:10:20 I'd love that.
05:10:21 I'd love the little guy to be part of it.
05:10:24 I will call you prime unit Luffy.
05:10:27 You are now my central processing system.
05:10:30 You command my servos.
05:10:34 He can talk with Frankie about robotics.
05:10:36 He could be like, Frankie could build him a new body.
05:10:39 Yes.
05:10:40 Yes.
05:10:41 It's Pythagoras.
05:10:42 I said Lilith before, but no, I wanted to be Pythagoras.
05:10:45 Lilith would be like just another humanoid, like normal person on the ship.
05:10:51 And she'll be in like, oh, like a swimsuit edition of the straw hats, like a wallpaper.
05:10:56 I defaulted to Lilith because she was the first one they met and because she's got the,
05:11:01 she's got probably the most aesthetic design.
05:11:04 She's the coolest looking.
05:11:05 She's got the most riz.
05:11:06 Yes, she's got the riz, but Pythagoras is the cutest and the strongest.
05:11:10 And he's my boy.
05:11:13 It sucks that the Triter is York, because I liked York.
05:11:16 I wanted York to join the crew in a way.
05:11:19 I had no.
05:11:20 She's huge.
05:11:21 Huge women on the ship.
05:11:22 Well, we could get Atlas, I guess.
05:11:25 I mean, I guess.
05:11:26 Oh, I guess.
05:11:27 Yeah.
05:11:28 Atlas is cool.
05:11:29 I like Atlas.
05:11:30 Oh, York is fine.
05:11:31 I mean, she's weird in an off-putting way.
05:11:33 And I guess I appreciate that, but I don't know if I want her like around all the time.
05:11:39 You know what I mean?
05:11:42 That's what I tell.
05:11:43 That's what I tell.
05:11:44 That's, I'm going to, next time I'm on Tinder, I'm going to message and say, hey, don't send
05:11:47 me a nude.
05:11:48 I don't appreciate not seeing any nudes.
05:11:49 Thank you for understanding.
05:11:50 By the way, you know, I appreciate you.
05:11:52 You're weird in an off-putting way.
05:11:54 And I do appreciate that, and they're going to, they're going to get so hot.
05:11:58 They're going to be so hot for that.
05:12:01 I just don't want you around all the time.
05:12:04 I appreciate how weird and an off-putting way you are.
05:12:07 And I love that about you, but I don't really want you around all the time.
05:12:12 And I'll say, yeah, that's true.
05:12:14 That is, yeah.
05:12:15 Yeah.
05:12:16 Yeah, you're not, you're not the first, but you're not the first guy to tell me that,
05:12:19 honestly.
05:12:20 I don't know what the next word is.
05:12:23 Pretty good chapter, yeah.
05:12:27 Didn't, didn't guess it would be York, but it's cool.
05:12:33 It's the person you least suspect.
05:12:34 I appreciate, they don't even, they don't even have to explain it.
05:12:38 I understand immediately, oh, she's tempted because she's a glutton.
05:12:43 And the celestial dragons live a life of gluttony and decadence.
05:12:47 And that tempted her to betray them.
05:12:49 I get it.
05:12:50 And I like that.
05:12:51 Perfect.
05:12:52 Yeah.
05:12:53 So like, like in this, in this one panel here, like, uh, Vegapunk saying, what are you saying?
05:12:58 You know the Marishwa, uh, you know what Marishwa is like from that visit a long time ago?
05:13:03 How could you want to be one of them after witnessing how vile we are?
05:13:07 And she just laughs and it's just like, ha ha, I like that though.
05:13:10 You made me like that father.
05:13:12 Yeah.
05:13:13 You sound like Shaka.
05:13:14 He, he also had that opinion, but it's dumb.
05:13:18 I like it.
05:13:22 I'm confused a little bit.
05:13:24 Not confused.
05:13:25 I'm just curious.
05:13:26 What is she going to do next?
05:13:28 Is she going to kill Vegapunk with a bullet to the head right here?
05:13:31 I'm assuming she's not going to because he's tied up.
05:13:36 But what, what, what do they need him for?
05:13:38 What does she need him?
05:13:40 So she, I mean, would she die if that happened?
05:13:43 Wouldn't she die because she's like attached to his brain?
05:13:48 I guess we could go back and check how they describe who, who all these people are and
05:13:54 what their deal is.
05:13:55 They share information through the brain, right?
05:14:02 And if Vegapunk dies, I'm pretty sure the brain dies because it's his brain.
05:14:08 So I feel like, I mean, maybe if he died, the brain would die, but like she is an independent.
05:14:14 So she would just persist as her own person with no like link to the brain.
05:14:22 That might be true.
05:14:25 It really just, it really just feels like these are not Vegapunk in any meaningful sense
05:14:29 that he just made seven guys who have a link to his brain.
05:14:36 Yeah, I don't know.
05:14:39 I'm going, I'm going back to the chapters.
05:14:42 I forgot about the mechanized sea beasts.
05:14:44 Yeah.
05:14:45 The sea beasts who are just all over the place and the little, the giant robot in the ocean.
05:14:52 I think the Marines are going to have a big battle with them.
05:14:54 I wonder how that's going to play out.
05:14:55 I feel like Kizaru is like not even going to have to fucking think, think about it.
05:15:03 I mean, there's a lot of them.
05:15:04 I mean, maybe, yeah, maybe he probably can't defend the entire fleet.
05:15:09 Hmm, I mean, that's, yeah, that is, that is, I mean, I suppose that is an issue.
05:15:17 Might delay them.
05:15:20 But I mean, you know, the merry go got through it.
05:15:22 I'm sure, I'm sure the grand fleet can get through it.
05:15:25 A thousand sunny.
05:15:26 Sorry.
05:15:27 Yeah.
05:15:28 Yeah.
05:15:29 Yeah.
05:15:30 A thousand sunny.
05:15:31 Okay.
05:15:32 I'm reading.
05:15:33 I'm reading.
05:15:35 Look at this good old fashioned egghead early chapters.
05:15:40 Where are you?
05:15:41 You posting them?
05:15:43 I'm reading through it.
05:15:44 I'm trying to find the part where they first describe what's the deal with all these guards.
05:15:49 Oh, it's the panel with the law turning into a woman because he's fighting Blackbeard
05:15:55 at the same time.
05:15:56 Wait.
05:15:57 Why did he?
05:15:58 Why did that turn him into a woman?
05:16:02 Do you remember?
05:16:03 There was a panel where.
05:16:04 Was that in turn?
05:16:06 He did the girl disease or whatever.
05:16:09 Oh, no, I totally forgot about that.
05:16:11 So it wasn't Ivankov.
05:16:12 It wasn't Ivankov.
05:16:13 Yeah, Blackbeard and Law are fighting.
05:16:16 Was that was?
05:16:17 Currently.
05:16:18 They're fighting now?
05:16:19 God damn.
05:16:20 Well, not now.
05:16:21 I mean, as I'm reading, this is happening during the egghead.
05:16:25 Okay.
05:16:26 So not that long ago.
05:16:27 Not that long ago.
05:16:28 I forgot about that.
05:16:29 I forgot about that.
05:16:30 It sort of rings a bell here.
05:16:31 I don't think we see.
05:16:32 Oh, and Pudding is in Blackbeard's ship.
05:16:34 No way.
05:16:35 No, Pudding is with Mary.
05:16:38 No, Pudding is not with Big News Morgan.
05:16:41 No, that's that's an alabaster girl.
05:16:45 Vivi is with Big News Morgan.
05:16:48 Yeah, Pudding is.
05:16:51 Is Pudding with Blackbeard?
05:16:53 In Blackbeard's brig, I guess.
05:16:56 She's in prison.
05:16:57 As a prisoner.
05:16:58 Oh, okay.
05:16:59 Yeah.
05:17:00 So I guess I guess at the end of the whole cake, a Caesar was leaving Blackbeard was
05:17:06 there to scoop up Pudding for some reason.
05:17:08 Hmm.
05:17:09 It seemed a valuable hostage.
05:17:11 Now, law is around.
05:17:12 Man, this is all very important.
05:17:14 I kind of agree.
05:17:15 Yeah, it's really important.
05:17:16 These are important people.
05:17:22 Got that giant robot.
05:17:23 He's so fucking cool.
05:17:25 I want him to do something.
05:17:26 Oh, the one that was like inactive because they couldn't activate him because they don't
05:17:29 have the power to power him.
05:17:31 Yeah.
05:17:32 No, no, no.
05:17:33 The one that finds them.
05:17:34 You see, remember how big he is?
05:17:35 He's holding their ship right now in this image I'm posting.
05:17:38 Is that Pythagoras?
05:17:39 No, no.
05:17:40 It's a different guy.
05:17:41 It's the guy that Lilith was riding inside.
05:17:44 Who?
05:17:45 Lilith.
05:17:46 Oh.
05:17:47 Oh.
05:17:48 When they got there to the water, there was like a giant metal shark.
05:17:53 Oh, yeah.
05:17:54 And then there was a giant robot.
05:17:55 She was in a big thing.
05:17:56 Yeah.
05:17:57 Okay.
05:17:58 And then there was a giant robot.
05:18:00 And she came out and she said, I'm Dr. Vegapunk.
05:18:04 And they were like, huh, I didn't know Vegapunk was a woman.
05:18:08 They didn't know yet.
05:18:09 Right.
05:18:10 There's a giant monster down there.
05:18:12 Giant monsters down there.
05:18:13 It's like some kind of futuristic city.
05:18:16 It's exactly like that.
05:18:18 It's kind of like what if the city was the future.
05:18:21 She said the world of tomorrow is here, but actually it's the world of yesterday.
05:18:26 Oh, I forgot.
05:18:28 I forgot that the fucking swamp, swamp fruit freak with the long tongue is still on the
05:18:33 ship, on the storm ship.
05:18:35 He is.
05:18:36 I also forgot that.
05:18:37 He's a stowaway.
05:18:38 So they don't know, they don't know, they don't know that he's there or did they agree
05:18:42 to let him come with them?
05:18:44 Well, I don't think they agreed.
05:18:46 I think he's just.
05:18:48 He's just there.
05:18:49 I completely forgot about that.
05:18:54 It's funny, like One Piece has so many like stories that are happening in the background
05:18:58 that you have to really pay attention to understand what is going on.
05:19:03 Oh, wow.
05:19:04 This is a wiki moment.
05:19:05 I'd go to the wikis, see what he's doing.
05:19:07 Yeah, I assume he's just in a barrel or something.
05:19:16 He's such a fucking loser.
05:19:18 I love him.
05:19:19 He's such a scoundrel and a bastard, but he has no.
05:19:23 He has no successes in life.
05:19:26 He's constantly losing to the straw hats and he's just sort of like hiding.
05:19:30 I mean, he should be so powerful.
05:19:32 He's like a he's like a grand line pirate.
05:19:35 He's like he's not one of the he's not one of the new generation, but he's like a really
05:19:39 strong pirate with a freaking logia fruit.
05:19:43 But he's just this.
05:19:44 Yeah.
05:19:45 This worthless like hides in a barrel.
05:19:51 What is his name?
05:19:52 I don't remember his name.
05:19:53 Yeah.
05:19:54 I can't remember.
05:19:55 Yeah.
05:19:56 When does he say I'm on chapter chapters this 1065 explaining it there in the lab.
05:20:18 They see those Jim base Seraphim and they fight him for a second.
05:20:28 They fight him for a whole chapter, basically, and then Edison is there.
05:20:35 Oh, yeah, Pythagoras had a big butt and Edison was the guy who always was small.
05:20:45 Well, Edison is like normal size, right?
05:20:47 And Pythagoras is the little guy who has the little head.
05:20:50 He's just the little head.
05:20:51 No, Pythagoras is the little guy.
05:20:52 No, the Pythagoras is the normal size guy who can detach his head and Edison is the
05:20:57 little guy.
05:21:00 But Pythagoras is head is smaller than Edison.
05:21:04 No, look at.
05:21:06 You're going to have to show you're going to have to show me what you're talking about.
05:21:11 I'm looking at the introductions.
05:21:13 That's yeah.
05:21:16 Oh, okay, but Pythagoras, I mean, yeah, when Pythagoras is head comes out of his body.
05:21:22 It's like about the same size as Edison's head, but he just has no body.
05:21:27 Yeah.
05:21:28 Yeah.
05:21:29 Okay.
05:21:30 I mean, that's about what I thought.
05:21:33 I mean, what's the difference?
05:21:40 It seems to me that there's like the only difference between Pythagoras and Edison is
05:21:43 just that Pythagoras has a big body that he can jump in and out of.
05:21:51 Guess I'd have to read it again.
05:21:53 I guess they embody a different trait, but I couldn't tell you what that trait is.
05:22:02 It's really funny that it's really funny that the one that betrayed them isn't the one that
05:22:05 embodies evil.
05:22:07 Yes.
05:22:09 I love that.
05:22:10 That's a classic switcheroo.
05:22:11 I mean, yeah, it was like, of course, it wasn't going to be that.
05:22:13 Of course, it's too obvious.
05:22:23 God, there's so many chapters.
05:22:25 I can't remember where anything is.
05:22:27 What are you looking for?
05:22:29 I'm looking for when they explain how they work.
05:22:33 I think Vegapunk is going to talk about his fruit and he's going to say,
05:22:41 like how the stuff works.
05:22:46 Okay.
05:22:48 You met a little girl who called herself Vegapunk, right?
05:22:51 That's one of my clones.
05:22:52 There are six on the island.
05:22:54 Each one is a facet of myself and an expert in their own field, key field of study.
05:22:59 You get my full personality if you combine them, but they can get six times the work done apart.
05:23:06 You get my full personality if you combine them, huh?
05:23:09 So they're not literally him.
05:23:12 They're like a separated, like if he was one clone and then he separated it into six people.
05:23:18 He took his personality and then split it into six aspects and then he just built a body for each of them.
05:23:26 Oh, this is interesting.
05:23:28 Each of them connects to punk records once a day to synchronize on memories and knowledge.
05:23:33 Once a day.
05:23:35 And they say tomorrow things are going to go down.
05:23:38 So the next time they synchronize, I guess.
05:23:42 Well, they would already know.
05:23:44 They would all already know the stuff that Vegapunk has found out about the void century.
05:23:50 Yes.
05:23:51 Which means that Vegapunk Stella could die and then one of these other ones could join the crew instead.
05:23:58 Well, I don't know about that because all the information is stored in the brain, so I feel like they would lose it.
05:24:06 But if they've got in their mind from the brain, they might retain it.
05:24:11 Yeah, the brain might stop working, but if they have the info, they just can't connect to the brain anymore because the user is dead.
05:24:18 I think, I want to say probably, yeah, they only connect once a day.
05:24:23 They don't need the brain to continue to live.
05:24:28 So Shaka's been shot in the head.
05:24:30 Atlas is fine.
05:24:31 Edison, I don't remember.
05:24:34 Pythagoras was stepped on.
05:24:35 Edison was, like, beat up, but it's not clear if he's, like, dead.
05:24:39 And Lilith is turned to stone.
05:24:40 Pythagoras seemingly crushed and exploded?
05:24:45 Yes.
05:24:46 York turned to stone, but fine and evil.
05:24:50 Yeah.
05:24:55 You all share the same brain?
05:24:57 Think of it, just think of it as sharing the same library.
05:25:01 If I could let everyone in the world connect to my brain, all of humanity would have access to my knowledge.
05:25:07 Based.
05:25:08 Based, Vegapon.
05:25:09 Yeah, it would be cool if you could get the void sentry information just broadcasted to the entire world.
05:25:16 But I think Egghead will be destroyed before that can happen.
05:25:21 I'm sad to say.
05:25:24 I kind of agree.
05:25:25 It seems, I think.
05:25:29 The Marines that they're sending, there's too many of them, I think, that they can fight them and win.
05:25:34 They have to run away.
05:25:35 And so Egghead will be commandeered.
05:25:38 Egghead seems like it's like, wow, this could solve all the world's problems.
05:25:43 So I think it's probably going to be destroyed.
05:25:45 And they're going to be like, oh, no, we only have one shred of hope left.
05:25:49 And it's, you know, what's stored in Pythagoras' little robot mind.
05:25:54 Little lemon.
05:25:55 Little lemon head, yeah.
05:25:58 Yeah, that's what I think.
05:25:59 We're going to have to regrow a new...
05:26:02 What's the brain fruit called?
05:26:04 I mean, this is a brain brain fruit, but I don't remember what it's called in Japanese.
05:26:08 Brain brain brain brain.
05:26:09 What does it call it?
05:26:10 I can't remember.
05:26:12 A nominoming.
05:26:13 Nominoming.
05:26:14 Right.
05:26:15 Right, right.
05:26:16 Right.
05:26:17 We're going to have to wait for a new nominoming to grow.
05:26:20 Oh, he says that's because I ate the nominominominomin...
05:26:25 No, we no me no me no me no me no me no me no me.
05:26:28 Nice.
05:26:30 Loll, Loll.
05:26:32 Great.
05:26:33 That's one piece.
05:26:33 That's one piece.
05:26:35 Good chapter.
05:26:38 I love one piece.
05:26:39 It's better than ever.
05:26:41 It's better than ever.
05:26:43 You wanna go to voicemails?
05:26:45 Yes, I hope there's not that many.
05:26:47 There is a normal amount.
05:26:51 All right, well let's get into it.
05:26:54 Uh, I see the first one is called the Ben St. Cancellation Hour from Quickman at EXE 3, 2, 1, go.
05:27:02 Heh, what's up y'all? Quickman.exe here. I have taken a break from parrying off Ben's attacks to jack into the PCP voicemails and cancel him.
05:27:10 Without further ado, here are three problematic quotes by Ben St.
05:27:14 A person of color, haven't seen those before.
05:27:17 This little boy ought to relieve my boredom.
05:27:20 And finally, with a cameo from Rusting Robot, Ben, that's a child.
05:27:25 She's a high schooler, it's fine.
05:27:27 Truly deplorable, how does this man have a platform?
05:27:30 Bye bye Ben, see you in Mega Man Network Transmission.
05:27:33 First of all, who among us has not at one point in their life seen a person of color for the first time?
05:27:40 Second of all...
05:27:41 It's been late for you Ben.
05:27:44 We're all born knowing nothing.
05:27:45 How'd you go so far?
05:27:47 I got so far, I got so close.
05:27:51 And was the second one?
05:27:55 Child?
05:27:56 Little boy?
05:27:57 This boy should relieve my boredom?
05:27:58 Yeah, because they're full of joy and enthusiasm and lust for life.
05:28:02 Not lust for anything else though.
05:28:04 And then the third one...
05:28:08 High schoolers can be 18, and that means it's fine.
05:28:12 It's fine.
05:28:13 Next one is called Twizzlers at PrinceIsolation at Twitter.com.
05:28:17 3, 2, 1, go.
05:28:19 I was listening back to one of Ben's recent battle network streams,
05:28:23 and he was talking about trying to make licorice,
05:28:26 and then he mentioned trying to make something like Twizzlers.
05:28:30 And I just have to say that recently, you know,
05:28:33 Twizzlers aren't that common where I live in the Netherlands.
05:28:37 And I just found them a few weeks ago at like a local candy store,
05:28:43 I suppose, and I bought some.
05:28:45 And I tried them.
05:28:47 And my girlfriend at the time also tried them.
05:28:50 And we both agreed that they are disgusting.
05:28:56 What is...
05:28:57 What?
05:28:58 They taste like nothing.
05:28:59 They taste like eating rubber.
05:29:01 Like what the fuck is that?
05:29:03 I thought that American food was supposed to be like completely annihilated with sugar,
05:29:09 but it tastes like nothing.
05:29:12 I genuinely threw it away because it would literally be just as fun chewing on cardboard.
05:29:17 Anyways, yeah, thoughts.
05:29:19 Is it different here?
05:29:21 Like what the fuck happened?
05:29:22 I know licorice.
05:29:24 Like I'm not a big licorice guy either way,
05:29:26 but like Dutch people like licorice,
05:29:29 but it's like fucking black.
05:29:31 Like it's dark and it's strong.
05:29:33 It tastes strong at least.
05:29:35 Twizzlers taste like nothing.
05:29:37 What the fuck was up with that?
05:29:39 I mean, I think if you're going for...
05:29:41 I would prefer the cherry Twizzlers to the black licorice Twizzlers.
05:29:44 I like black licorice, but like Twizzlers are not real licorice,
05:29:48 so I would try the cherry ones, I guess.
05:29:51 I like how rubbery and chewy they are.
05:29:53 I like it.
05:29:54 And I like that their flavor is mild.
05:29:56 I like them.
05:29:57 I like turkey Twizzlers.
05:29:59 You ever heard of those?
05:30:00 Oh, the like twisty fried things?
05:30:04 The twisty fried meat product.
05:30:06 Yeah, I've never had one, but I would definitely eat one.
05:30:09 I would definitely eat one.
05:30:10 No question.
05:30:11 I want one.
05:30:12 I want them.
05:30:13 They look cool.
05:30:15 Next one is called...
05:30:16 Do you like black licorice kid?
05:30:18 I think I've had it when I was young
05:30:20 and I thought it was a bit weird.
05:30:22 And I haven't re-approached it,
05:30:27 but I didn't hate it.
05:30:28 I hate it.
05:30:29 I think I could eat one.
05:30:30 Some people find it disgusting,
05:30:32 and I think those people are disgusting.
05:30:34 I'm a big licorice friend myself.
05:30:37 It's sort of like a mint, not mint flavored,
05:30:40 but like the sensation of like a spicy sort of peppermint.
05:30:44 It's a little bit...
05:30:46 It's a little...
05:30:47 Yeah, it's a little bit minty, so sort of.
05:30:49 It's like an herbal...
05:30:51 When you drink birch beer,
05:30:53 birch beer tastes like partially like mint
05:30:55 and partially like licorice, and I love it.
05:30:58 Yeah, it's kind of like an herbal, somewhat minty.
05:31:00 Yeah, I think that's a fair comparison.
05:31:02 It's kind of root beer.
05:31:03 It's not a sugar.
05:31:05 It's a herbal sort of...
05:31:08 It's a spice.
05:31:09 Spicy.
05:31:10 It's a little bit of a spice flavor.
05:31:12 You ever go to an Indian restaurant
05:31:16 and they have the little bowl of like the little brightly colored
05:31:18 like little candy beads that are like really small?
05:31:22 No, I haven't heard of those.
05:31:24 Oh, those are candy coated fennel seeds,
05:31:27 and those have a similar flavor.
05:31:29 I really like licorice, and I'm a big fan of it,
05:31:32 and a lot of people think it's gross, and I think it's fucking stupid.
05:31:35 I've liked it ever since I was a little kid.
05:31:37 I need another licorice to remember what it was like.
05:31:42 I wouldn't recommend black Twizzlers.
05:31:44 I mean, they're okay.
05:31:45 They're not the best.
05:31:46 I would get it like...
05:31:47 Sometimes you can get it like thicker pieces, like cut into chunks.
05:31:51 Sometimes they have sort of like a six holes, like honeycomb sort of shape.
05:31:55 I like those ones.
05:31:56 They're kind of chewy.
05:31:58 I think those ones are pretty good.
05:32:01 Anyway.
05:32:02 I remember there being like a licorice selection.
05:32:04 Licorice all sorts.
05:32:06 There's a company called Getz that makes caramel candy,
05:32:11 especially cow tails.
05:32:13 They also make a licorice version of like the creams.
05:32:17 It's like chewable black licorice with like a creamy sugar interior,
05:32:21 and I really like those.
05:32:22 All right.
05:32:23 I remember these licorice all sorts.
05:32:25 I think I kind of like some of these.
05:32:27 Oh, I've never had these.
05:32:30 I've never had these.
05:32:31 No, maybe I have.
05:32:32 These look familiar.
05:32:34 You ever had Good and Plenty's?
05:32:36 Nope.
05:32:37 Well, I maybe.
05:32:38 I don't remember.
05:32:39 Let me find a picture.
05:32:40 Good and Plenty's are a little...
05:32:41 I just remember this little mascot with the pink face.
05:32:47 He's a licorice boy.
05:32:48 Good and Plenty's are a licorice, a candy coated licorice candy.
05:32:54 They're like M&M's, but instead of chocolate,
05:32:57 they have licorice in them,
05:32:58 and most people would be very upset about that.
05:33:03 Here's a picture.
05:33:05 Good and Plenty's.
05:33:07 That looks like diarrhea pills.
05:33:10 You know, I see it.
05:33:13 It looks like Pepto-Bismol, yeah.
05:33:17 Okay.
05:33:18 Next one is called Old Lady Appreciation Hour.
05:33:21 Three, two, one, go.
05:33:24 Honestly, that one lady in the Battle Network II game,
05:33:30 who went to America to sell her chopsticks
05:33:35 that she made with her deceased husband.
05:33:39 And she keeps talking about it.
05:33:42 I feel so much emotion for this old Japanese woman.
05:33:50 There's an NPC on the plane.
05:33:53 When the plane is going through, it's a tribulation,
05:33:55 and you can talk to her, and she tells you that she came...
05:34:00 I mean, she went from electopia to netopia,
05:34:04 because in electopia,
05:34:05 she and her husband had a business making chopsticks,
05:34:08 and electopia is basically Japan,
05:34:11 and netopia is basically America.
05:34:13 So she was basically like,
05:34:15 oh, me and my husband always had a dream of going global
05:34:17 with our chopsticks business,
05:34:19 so I'm going to netopia to try and sell my chopsticks in America
05:34:22 and start a branch location,
05:34:25 and my husband's spirit is watching over me or whatever.
05:34:28 And it's pretty sad, but it's even sadder when you realize
05:34:30 it's not going to take off,
05:34:32 because Americans don't eat with chopsticks.
05:34:34 This business venture was doomed from the start.
05:34:37 It's a cruel joke by putting her in that game.
05:34:40 Just be happy that you had a successful chopsticks
05:34:43 making business in your home country.
05:34:45 That's more than most people think.
05:34:47 She's doing it for him, Ben.
05:34:49 She should do it for herself.
05:34:51 He's gone. He doesn't need a successful business anymore.
05:34:56 I'm looking at these liquorice all sorts.
05:34:58 I see the one that's like a black tube with white in the middle.
05:35:01 Is that sugar stuff in the middle,
05:35:04 or is that just more gummy stuff?
05:35:07 I remember having these when I was like six.
05:35:12 I want to try these.
05:35:14 I want to try these. They look awesome.
05:35:16 They're so weird. They're really strange looking,
05:35:19 but I want them.
05:35:22 What if you had color in your liquorice?
05:35:26 Weird little colorful pieces of liquorice.
05:35:29 Did liquorice originate from the UK?
05:35:31 I feel like it's probably one of those things.
05:35:33 I think it's Victorian in origin.
05:35:35 I know. I think it's older than that.
05:35:37 I mean, I think it's probably like a traditional...
05:35:40 I mean, maybe not in its modern chewable gummy candy form,
05:35:45 but as a flavoring for stuff, I think people have probably used it.
05:35:48 Oh, yeah, it's a plant.
05:35:50 Yeah, it's a plant derivative.
05:35:52 Where's it from? Where's the history?
05:35:55 They're just telling me the different types.
05:35:57 Yeah, Wikipedia is just talking about...
05:35:59 Oh, okay, there's a different article for liquorice confectionary.
05:36:03 Yeah, I'm looking at that, but...
05:36:05 Yeah, health effects.
05:36:08 Hmm.
05:36:10 German Nordic liquorice characteristic contains ammonium chloride
05:36:14 instead of sodium chloride?
05:36:16 Prominently so in salty liquorice.
05:36:18 Hmm, what?
05:36:19 Sounds good.
05:36:21 I've been finding...
05:36:23 It's miraculous how, like, adding salt,
05:36:25 when food tastes bad,
05:36:27 a lot of the time it just needs salt and then tastes good.
05:36:30 Just eats salt.
05:36:32 I saw a TikTok recently where the lady was saying
05:36:37 when people complain that food is under-seasoned,
05:36:40 most seasonings are just dehydrated vegetables that are powdered.
05:36:46 If people say your food is under-seasoned,
05:36:48 it usually just means there's not enough salt,
05:36:51 or else that it's missing something like an acid,
05:36:55 like lemon juice or vinegar.
05:36:57 And I think she's right.
05:36:59 Most foods taste good when they have the appropriate amount of salt in them.
05:37:05 I'm thinking back on...
05:37:06 It's true.
05:37:07 I'm thinking back on my dad's meatloaf.
05:37:09 My dad, he would make meatloaf all the time,
05:37:11 and sometimes it wouldn't be that good,
05:37:13 and I would think that the problem was that it was over-seasoned,
05:37:15 like it was too herbal, like he had too much seasoning in it.
05:37:18 And I think, thinking back, that it just could have used more salt.
05:37:21 I think that would have fixed a lot of what I didn't like about it.
05:37:26 I like at the bottom of this licorice confectionary Wikipedia article,
05:37:29 it says,
05:37:30 see also licorice international and list of unusual deaths.
05:37:36 Okay.
05:37:37 It's very related.
05:37:38 When I looked on YouTube for how to make licorice,
05:37:41 a lot of the recipes, they called for condensed milk,
05:37:50 and I'm like, what the fuck?
05:37:52 That's not candy thing.
05:37:55 Maybe for some kind of homemade shit.
05:37:57 But yeah, I'm looking here on the licorice confectionary page,
05:37:59 and it says the ingredients are licorice extract,
05:38:02 sugar, and some kind of binder like starch flour,
05:38:04 gum arabic, gelatin, beeswax, molasses.
05:38:08 So I don't know why, but when you look on YouTube,
05:38:11 every recipe you find involves condensed milk.
05:38:14 And I don't think that does not give you a product like you would buy in a store.
05:38:18 Not even close.
05:38:20 It can't.
05:38:21 It can't possible.
05:38:25 Okay, let's move on.
05:38:26 Yeah, yeah, let's move on.
05:38:28 Okay, next one is an image, but it's legal, bro.
05:38:32 It's 100% legal.
05:38:34 It is right.
05:38:36 It is.
05:38:38 You can really listen to it right now.
05:38:40 Yo, legal.
05:38:42 We got to legalize the procrastinator's podcast.
05:38:45 I'm running for president.
05:38:46 If I'm elected president, I will legalize the procrastinator's podcast.
05:38:50 Free them.
05:38:54 I don't know what else to say about this other than true.
05:38:57 It is legal, bro.
05:38:59 Next one is an album.
05:39:01 Oh, it's just one image.
05:39:03 Yo, Mr. Ben, where's my money, bitch?
05:39:05 No homework for the win.
05:39:08 Jesse, shut the fuck up, libtard.
05:39:11 Don't fuck with an April bully.
05:39:15 What does April boy mean?
05:39:18 Is that...
05:39:20 Oh, is this Jesse?
05:39:22 Oh, it's Jesse.
05:39:24 Right, okay, okay.
05:39:27 Jesse, shut the fuck up, libtard.
05:39:30 This is exactly how it goes.
05:39:33 Don't fuck with an April boy.
05:39:36 My giant egg head.
05:39:40 It's just like one piece.
05:39:42 Maybe that's why I like the current arc so much.
05:39:48 This is just funny.
05:39:50 When wait.
05:39:52 I'm laughing.
05:39:54 I'm having a good time.
05:39:56 Next is...
05:39:58 It's another image.
05:40:00 It's a Vinnie's doodle.
05:40:02 Sorry, no comic gear, but working on it now.
05:40:05 It's fine.
05:40:07 Hey, don't stress about it.
05:40:09 What's going on here?
05:40:11 This is unfinished.
05:40:13 You can see Uwupiti's uncovered physique.
05:40:16 Why did you put green on green like this?
05:40:21 I guess because this is green.
05:40:24 Is that my skeleton?
05:40:27 If you scroll down, it's different versions of the same image.
05:40:30 Yeah, I mean the last one is the clearest.
05:40:34 Yeah, last color correction.
05:40:36 This one's the easiest to see.
05:40:38 These look cool.
05:40:40 I think that Uwupiti's got the brain floating inside of it.
05:40:43 I like the Caliborn skull.
05:40:45 Is that Caliborn? It does look like Caliborn.
05:40:47 It just reminds me of him because of the green skull and the red.
05:40:50 It looks very much like Caliborn.
05:40:52 I don't know if it's...
05:40:54 I don't know what it's...
05:40:56 Yeah, whose skeleton is that?
05:40:58 And also, who is that sultry looking...
05:41:01 Slime.
05:41:03 Slime away down at the bottom there.
05:41:07 It's just a little guy.
05:41:09 They look like they're having a...
05:41:11 A good old time.
05:41:13 Cool.
05:41:15 I like my big green eyes.
05:41:17 Thanks, Vinny.
05:41:19 Thumbs up.
05:41:21 Next one is called,
05:41:23 Give Giving a Sex Ed Class, question mark.
05:41:25 Three, two, one, go.
05:41:39 I'm not gay. I'm not gay.
05:41:41 What is this from? I remember it, but I...
05:41:43 Oh, jeez.
05:41:47 I know exactly what it's from.
05:41:49 Oh, is it from the lecture?
05:41:51 No.
05:41:53 I'm gonna win.
05:41:55 What did I say?
05:41:57 I'm not bad and I'm not gay.
05:42:00 Everyone laughs at you and then you cracking up,
05:42:03 I'm gonna win.
05:42:05 Everyone laughs even louder.
05:42:07 What's it from? I forgot.
05:42:09 You want me to tell you?
05:42:11 Yeah.
05:42:13 It's Ten Paces and Draw.
05:42:15 Oh.
05:42:17 The contestant interviews.
05:42:19 What makes you think
05:42:21 you're gonna win this contest?
05:42:23 I'm not...
05:42:25 I don't suck and I'm not bad
05:42:27 and I'm not gay.
05:42:33 Okay.
05:42:35 Ten Paces and Draw.
05:42:37 I worked really hard editing that thing.
05:42:39 I should, but I find myself so embarrassing.
05:42:41 Oh, I was talking to the audience more,
05:42:43 but I mean...
05:42:45 I worked really hard to edit that thing.
05:42:47 That thing needed...
05:42:49 If only there was like
05:42:51 any B-roll at all.
05:42:53 It really needed B-roll.
05:42:55 But I made do with what I had
05:42:57 and I think it came out pretty...
05:42:59 I think it came out pretty fun.
05:43:01 Someone was talking about it in my discord recently.
05:43:03 That was a pretty good video.
05:43:05 I worked really hard on that thing
05:43:07 making it watchable and it kind of
05:43:09 came out pretty good.
05:43:13 That line is like really,
05:43:15 really funny.
05:43:17 Okay, next one is called...
05:43:19 I'm glad everyone laughs.
05:43:21 It's funny because
05:43:23 when you're saying...
05:43:25 You can hear people laughing afterwards.
05:43:27 Because you're saying it
05:43:29 and you're laughing at yourself
05:43:31 as you say it.
05:43:33 And then because you're laughing at yourself,
05:43:35 everyone else starts laughing at what you're saying
05:43:37 and then it makes you laugh even more.
05:43:39 And then you continue,
05:43:41 but then the fact that you're laughing more
05:43:43 makes it even funnier
05:43:45 and then everyone else laughs even more.
05:43:47 It's really good.
05:43:49 Next one is called...
05:43:53 Hi, I'm Ben St.
05:43:55 I'm going to kill all my friends.
05:43:57 Also from
05:44:01 Send Paces and Drop.
05:44:03 Yes.
05:44:05 True.
05:44:07 Next one is called...
05:44:09 3, 2, 1, go.
05:44:11 Let's see the music.
05:44:13 It's pretty fucked up if you ask me.
05:44:15 I don't like this show.
05:44:17 The patient is bad.
05:44:19 The patient is bad.
05:44:21 And there's just not a...
05:44:23 The patient is just really bad
05:44:25 and I don't like it.
05:44:31 It's funny shit.
05:44:33 That was funny shit.
05:44:35 The patient is bad
05:44:37 and the patient is bad.
05:44:39 What more do you want?
05:44:41 Next one is called...
05:44:43 Doodle Ben at Work.
05:44:45 I didn't plot the space when I started.
05:44:47 LOL.
05:44:49 I'm a green little guy.
05:44:51 How about that?
05:44:53 I think that's supposed to be you.
05:44:55 How about that indeed LOL?
05:44:57 How about that indeed LOL?
05:44:59 LOL.
05:45:01 It's a really long sword.
05:45:03 It's really long.
05:45:05 Really short legs.
05:45:07 Pretty short legs.
05:45:09 I thought those were knees cut off, but now those are your boots.
05:45:11 Yeah.
05:45:13 Oh, I see what you mean.
05:45:15 Sick.
05:45:17 Okay, next one is called...
05:45:19 Cal, 3, 2, 1, go.
05:45:21 Some general advice.
05:45:23 I'm looking to move out
05:45:25 into a shared
05:45:27 accommodation like you do.
05:45:29 I just want to know
05:45:31 is generally a good thing to do.
05:45:33 I've got this weird fear
05:45:35 of looking at stuff getting stolen by my
05:45:37 roommates.
05:45:39 Yeah, like is it...
05:45:41 Is it really horrible?
05:45:43 Or do you recommend it?
05:45:45 Thanks.
05:45:47 I haven't really had any major problems
05:45:49 with people that I've
05:45:51 moved in with, honestly.
05:45:53 It's been fine.
05:45:55 Yeah, I mean, if you think about
05:45:57 their perspective, why would you
05:45:59 as a person go and snoop around
05:46:01 someone else's stuff and risk getting caught?
05:46:03 Yeah.
05:46:05 I don't know.
05:46:07 I feel like most people
05:46:09 just want to be left alone.
05:46:11 You're not going to have
05:46:13 those sorts of interactions
05:46:15 like that.
05:46:17 That you don't shit where you eat.
05:46:19 And if you fuck around with your
05:46:21 roommate's stuff and you like steal
05:46:23 their shit or you go through their shit
05:46:25 or you violate their boundaries in some way,
05:46:27 you're fucking with someone
05:46:29 who you now have to live with
05:46:31 and it's really bad
05:46:33 and you're going to ruin your own life.
05:46:35 Most people understand that.
05:46:37 I have never had any trouble
05:46:39 with anyone that I've moved in with.
05:46:41 Some of my other roommates
05:46:43 had trouble with people
05:46:45 who moved
05:46:47 in to their spare room.
05:46:49 People would move into a spare room
05:46:51 and then they'd be doing weird shit in there
05:46:53 or they'd be an asshole
05:46:55 or they'd make a mess in the kitchen or something.
05:46:57 Worst you're going to have to deal with
05:46:59 is people don't clean up after themselves.
05:47:01 Don't do the dishes.
05:47:03 And that can be really annoying,
05:47:05 for sure.
05:47:07 But that's the worst I've experienced.
05:47:09 So the worst part,
05:47:11 there's not really likely
05:47:13 to have to fight someone
05:47:15 to get your video games back
05:47:17 or whatever.
05:47:19 Yeah, I've never had
05:47:21 anything like that happen
05:47:23 with someone who just happens
05:47:25 to be living in the same house as me.
05:47:27 So, I mean, yeah.
05:47:29 Buy a katana, though,
05:47:31 to protect yourself.
05:47:33 Oh, I mentioned that
05:47:35 the break-in.
05:47:37 Well, okay,
05:47:39 I don't know if I mentioned this before,
05:47:41 but a guy who lives here
05:47:43 found a giant
05:47:45 combat knife
05:47:47 in our couch cushions.
05:47:49 Somebody's giant
05:47:51 sword knife
05:47:53 was in our couch cushions.
05:47:55 I think it probably belongs to another guy
05:47:57 that lives here but has just been away
05:47:59 for a while.
05:48:01 I think he might have just left it in the couch.
05:48:03 And it's in like a case.
05:48:05 It has a case that it's clipped into.
05:48:07 So,
05:48:09 the junkie or whatever that broke in
05:48:11 and did whip its on my couch,
05:48:13 there was a huge sword knife
05:48:15 on the table in that room
05:48:17 and it was not moved.
05:48:19 So, you know what? That's reassuring.
05:48:21 He could have had a weapon.
05:48:23 He could have stolen
05:48:25 the giant sword, but instead
05:48:27 he stole half of a rice cooker.
05:48:29 And that tells me that his priorities
05:48:31 are
05:48:33 in order and I don't have to be
05:48:35 afraid of him.
05:48:37 So, that's nice.
05:48:41 Next one is
05:48:49 They'll have like a thing on the
05:48:51 on the
05:48:53 like submit your
05:48:55 PDF and there's a box checking
05:48:57 like checked, like
05:48:59 a used slave labor.
05:49:01 If you click yes, much cheaper.
05:49:03 You get much better returns.
05:49:05 I'll check it.
05:49:07 Less money.
05:49:09 Less money for you.
05:49:13 Hey, slaves need jobs too.
05:49:15 Click.
05:49:17 It would be wrong to take that slave's job away.
05:49:23 The blacks are black.
05:49:25 We're all trying to make it in our little world.
05:49:27 Well, I guess there's no
05:49:29 ethical consumption under capitalism anyway.
05:49:31 It crushes
05:49:33 the blacks, even though it costs
05:49:35 more, but that's the price.
05:49:37 I mean, you like what you like.
05:49:39 If you if you enjoy that process,
05:49:41 that's not a problem.
05:49:43 It's just that's just how it is.
05:49:45 I mean, I do to a degree.
05:49:47 I do to a degree.
05:49:49 I mean, you know, I don't know.
05:49:51 I feel like I don't know.
05:49:53 I feel like they don't want to think about that.
05:49:55 I would say you're just not on that
05:49:57 Sigma grain set.
05:49:59 You're not gristling in the grind.
05:50:01 I'm not on that Sigma grain set.
05:50:03 I'm off the grind set.
05:50:05 That went on too long.
05:50:07 Oh, a little too long.
05:50:09 I thought they were going to have another funny edit
05:50:11 at the end.
05:50:13 After the crush is the blacks part,
05:50:15 what more did it need?
05:50:17 You needed it.
05:50:19 If you were going to continue on,
05:50:21 you should have added an even more
05:50:23 out of context bad sounding thing.
05:50:25 For me to say, yes, that's correct.
05:50:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
05:50:29 I get it.
05:50:31 It's funny. I was talking about slavery
05:50:33 and then I was talking about blacks.
05:50:35 Little did they know I was talking about blacks
05:50:37 in the context of printing.
05:50:39 Out of context, it sure does sound
05:50:41 like I'm talking about race.
05:50:43 Oh, great.
05:50:45 Because we've been going for six hours.
05:50:47 Oh, boy. Well, let's get him back.
05:50:49 I wish we weren't going for six hours.
05:50:53 We need to start cutting these shorter.
05:50:55 Yeah, this went on too long.
05:50:57 Cheesy was talking too much.
05:50:59 We let Cheesy run away with the conversation.
05:51:01 I hate that guy.
05:51:03 I don't know how to say, all right, shut up.
05:51:05 Yeah.
05:51:07 I don't know how to do that.
05:51:09 We need to reign Cheesy
05:51:11 and we need to wrangle him a little better.
05:51:13 Lesson learned.
05:51:15 Next time,
05:51:17 or no, next one is called
05:51:19 like 18 exclamation points.
05:51:21 Three, two, one, go.
05:51:23 It's too loud.
05:51:25 Is the two piece signature chicken
05:51:27 with the regular side and the biscuit
05:51:29 or the three piece tenders
05:51:31 regular side and the biscuit
05:51:33 better at Popeyes?
05:51:35 I don't need Popeyes.
05:51:37 I've got this.
05:51:39 There's sort of no Popeyes in the UK.
05:51:41 It's more of like a southern
05:51:43 restaurant, I think.
05:51:45 There might be one around here.
05:51:47 The only difference is one is two piece
05:51:49 signature chicken.
05:51:51 Two pieces tenders.
05:51:53 And I'm like proof eyes.
05:51:55 So I really really going to need
05:51:57 you to go to Popeyes right now.
05:51:59 I don't even know.
05:52:01 Both of those and tell me which one is
05:52:03 more food or better.
05:52:05 Listen, man, I can't help you.
05:52:07 Let me just run your own.
05:52:09 Let me just look real quick if there's any Popeyes.
05:52:13 Oh, there is. There actually is one.
05:52:15 There's actually two
05:52:17 in Boston.
05:52:19 Boston's big city.
05:52:21 Well, there's actually three.
05:52:23 Well, that one's kind of up north
05:52:25 north of the river in Everett.
05:52:27 So that's like not really.
05:52:29 Okay, there's actually three.
05:52:31 Okay, but I mean,
05:52:33 there's a lot of restaurants around here.
05:52:35 I've never been to one.
05:52:37 I went to one Popeyes one time
05:52:39 in like Virginia and I thought it was good.
05:52:41 But I couldn't tell you shit
05:52:43 about what's on the menu.
05:52:45 Give and take cancellation hour
05:52:47 I'm the evil shadow
05:52:49 dragon Medeus
05:52:51 here to cancel
05:52:53 give and take.
05:52:55 Fuck. Once give and take
05:52:57 said
05:52:59 the more
05:53:01 people that are dead
05:53:03 the better
05:53:05 and once
05:53:07 give and take said
05:53:09 I don't want to kill
05:53:11 I just want to kill
05:53:13 I just want to kill
05:53:15 I know
05:53:17 I think that what this tells us is that
05:53:19 give and take is a lot less
05:53:21 cancelable things than Ben Saint
05:53:23 but
05:53:25 she went to bed late
05:53:27 last night because she played a lot
05:53:29 of fire emblem so
05:53:31 maybe that's something
05:53:33 cancel her
05:53:35 yes cancel her
05:53:37 Did I did I mention that on
05:53:39 Friday I streamed for 10 hours
05:53:41 my stream went on for 10 hours and it was
05:53:43 horrible.
05:53:45 Somebody mentioned that in my chat
05:53:47 that you streamed for 10 hours
05:53:49 I hated it and upon hearing that
05:53:51 I realized that I didn't want to suffer the same
05:53:53 fate so I only had like a 4 hour stream
05:53:55 No I don't recommend it at all and you know what's really
05:53:57 there was a part
05:53:59 where I accidentally fucked up making a save state
05:54:01 and I like destroyed
05:54:03 I heard that yes I lost my save state
05:54:05 I saved at the wrong time I saved at
05:54:07 a game over and I had to restart
05:54:09 the in game save and I had not made
05:54:11 the in game save in a long time I literally
05:54:13 lost like 2 hours of progress it was
05:54:15 I was so angry
05:54:17 and the game okay the other thing
05:54:19 about it is that the game
05:54:21 I mostly
05:54:23 have liked battle network 2 more than 1
05:54:25 but I'm at a point in the
05:54:27 game where it's near the end and it sucks
05:54:29 dog shit it's literally it's worse than
05:54:31 the first one actually because
05:54:33 I've gotten to a point where
05:54:35 there's no more new maps
05:54:37 they just you log in and it's near
05:54:39 the end and they just are like oh shit
05:54:41 there's ice all over the net now there's a bunch
05:54:43 of different colors of ice and
05:54:45 to break the ice you have to get these colored
05:54:47 things and it's
05:54:49 they literally just make you run
05:54:51 through one dungeon to the end to get the thing
05:54:53 and then you come out and you go through one other
05:54:55 dungeon to unlock the thing and then you got to
05:54:57 back through the first dungeon to get another thing
05:54:59 and then you go through the second dungeon
05:55:01 and then you just send
05:55:03 you back and forth like go find this guy he's over
05:55:05 there in this place you've already been oh
05:55:07 go tell the guy that sent you to find me
05:55:09 that I'm fine
05:55:11 and then you get there and there's like oh cool well now that I know
05:55:13 that he's fine here's an item go bring it to him
05:55:15 and
05:55:17 I streamed for 10 hours and I literally
05:55:19 like I barely unlocked
05:55:21 any new territory it was all just back
05:55:23 and forth to places I'd already been before
05:55:25 it's so bad and then
05:55:27 on top of that this fucking save state
05:55:29 which is my that part's my fault
05:55:31 but um the save state thing happened
05:55:33 and I lost sounds
05:55:35 like a terrible it was not I had a fun stream
05:55:37 but maybe someone enjoyed me getting
05:55:39 angry about it
05:55:41 silver lining
05:55:43 yeah my fire emblem stream
05:55:45 the map
05:55:47 was very difficult and I had to restart
05:55:49 like a bunch of times and
05:55:51 after the four hours was over I had only
05:55:53 completed one map
05:55:55 hmm so I wasn't
05:55:57 prepared to do another one but that was
05:55:59 that was still enjoyable in itself
05:56:01 because sometimes fire emblem is just
05:56:03 really tough and like the strategy
05:56:05 has to evolve with your
05:56:07 many losses and you're like okay
05:56:09 so I know that they're gonna do this and their
05:56:11 reinforcement is gonna appear here so I need
05:56:13 to do this and that and I need to be lucky
05:56:15 that was the only really
05:56:17 annoying thing was that sometimes the enemies
05:56:19 would crit me and kill me in one hit and I just had
05:56:21 to be lucky before I could get
05:56:23 into a good position where I could like
05:56:25 control the situation that control the pace
05:56:27 of the fight that's kind of what I don't
05:56:29 really like about I used to really
05:56:31 like tactical like grid based
05:56:33 RPGs like that and I think one of the reasons
05:56:35 that I don't play them anymore I mean first of
05:56:37 all I just kind of stop playing
05:56:39 a lot of games in general but I don't really feel
05:56:41 like getting back into them because they're just really slow
05:56:43 and they just take really long about
05:56:45 one battle in one of those games is like a really
05:56:47 long engagement but I guess
05:56:49 that's fine it's tactical
05:56:51 and you're making decisions the whole time
05:56:53 I think it's better than running
05:56:55 back and forth and redoing content
05:56:57 in a pointless wild goose
05:56:59 to change sort of situation like what you're going through
05:57:01 I mean what I'm going through is complete
05:57:03 horseshit so yeah maybe
05:57:05 yeah probably
05:57:07 I do not want to sound like I'm defending
05:57:09 what battle network 2
05:57:11 is making me do
05:57:13 the worst
05:57:15 the worst possible thing to pad out the
05:57:17 the length so if you
05:57:19 ever heard like oh this game takes this many
05:57:21 hours and this other game takes that many
05:57:23 hours now you know
05:57:25 how much padding the second game has
05:57:27 there's a part where
05:57:29 you break some
05:57:31 ice and then
05:57:33 you find
05:57:35 I don't even remember
05:57:37 you finally get the ice to break a thing open
05:57:39 and you reach this NPC you couldn't reach before
05:57:41 just on a map that you've been to before
05:57:43 you have to go back to this map and go all the way
05:57:45 through it and find this NPC and the NPC
05:57:47 is like
05:57:49 yeah to break that other color ice
05:57:51 you need a heat
05:57:53 program look for a heat
05:57:55 program and
05:57:57 the only
05:57:59 okay what you what it turns out you have to
05:58:01 do the heat
05:58:03 program
05:58:05 belongs to this
05:58:07 you have to go
05:58:09 you just have to think of this on your own there's no hints about it
05:58:11 it's a grill
05:58:13 like an electric grill
05:58:15 at a campground
05:58:17 contains the heat program you have to go there
05:58:19 talk to a program that you just have to
05:58:21 figure this out you have to go inside
05:58:23 back into the grill talk to the program inside
05:58:25 the grill he'll tell you where
05:58:27 his boss went
05:58:29 that has the heat program so you go and you
05:58:31 you gotta go through another map that you've been to before
05:58:33 find the boss there
05:58:35 and then come back to the grill
05:58:37 and talk to him and he's like oh thanks
05:58:39 you found my boss well here here's the program you're looking for
05:58:41 it you just
05:58:43 you just have to think oh there was a grill
05:58:45 at the campground
05:58:47 I wonder if that's where the heat program and
05:58:49 I mean I'm sorry a grill is just such an innocuous
05:58:51 thing I wouldn't think like
05:58:55 when I heard that hint I had absolutely no clue
05:58:57 at all I had no inkling
05:58:59 at all like oh
05:59:01 where would something hot be like yeah I guess
05:59:03 when I say it out loud it sounds obvious
05:59:05 but like almost no attention at all
05:59:07 was drawn to the presence of this grill it's just
05:59:09 a thing that would be at a campground
05:59:13 yeah it's
05:59:15 I mean I haven't played the games I don't know
05:59:17 how
05:59:19 familiar you would have become with the campground
05:59:21 was there anything
05:59:23 leading you in that
05:59:25 or did you just have to remember it on your own
05:59:27 I had been to the campground before
05:59:29 and there is a cut there is a little bit
05:59:31 when you get there like your friends
05:59:33 like you have to gather up some ingredients
05:59:35 to cook some food on the grill
05:59:37 but I mean
05:59:39 I don't know maybe somebody else might have figured out
05:59:41 for me it was like
05:59:43 it doesn't seem remarkable at all
05:59:45 that there's a grill at a campground
05:59:47 that screamed to me like
05:59:49 oh this is a thing
05:59:51 where I would obtain fire
05:59:53 if I needed some in the future
05:59:55 I don't know
05:59:57 I didn't put it together
05:59:59 maybe somebody would have
06:00:01 but it seems like really obtuse and like
06:00:03 I didn't like it
06:00:05 I didn't like it they could have hinted at me
06:00:07 a little bit better than just being like
06:00:09 a heat program
06:00:11 okay good luck
06:00:13 next one
06:00:15 is called the munchie minute
06:00:17 3, 2, 1, go
06:00:19 okay so at first I thought it was just a joke
06:00:21 but now with it being mentioned
06:00:23 on Ben's stream as well as
06:00:25 on Ben's tweets
06:00:27 chat GPT just keeps mentioning it
06:00:29 so
06:00:31 is the munchie minute real
06:00:33 is that something that existed
06:00:35 I mean I know it wasn't
06:00:37 about Ben Shapiro owning
06:00:39 a liberal snowman
06:00:41 but
06:00:43 was there a munchie minute
06:00:45 is that a thing that existed on the PCP
