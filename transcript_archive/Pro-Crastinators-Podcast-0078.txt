00:00:00 Oh, hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of the PCP Crogue Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:24 Oh, I fucked everything up. I don't know. I'm the best guy ever, though, and thanks for joining us.
00:00:29 Here we've got Tom Oliver over here. Yeah, I'm here with my robot body.
00:00:37 Indeed. The Davoo is here. Still just barely able to juggle the scheduling and in monetary conflicts
00:00:45 caused by having to do PCP responsibilities while hashtag saving the hamsters. They'll have robot
00:00:54 hamster bodies soon anyway. We've got Hippocrit is here. I identify as being a robot skeleton.
00:01:03 Good. And of course, Digibro. All I want is the Android dong.
00:01:11 Android dong. Okay, never mind. So, everybody, we're talking about... Oh, I got introduced
00:01:18 the show. So, this is The Pro Crastinators Podcast, everybody. It's a podcast of a bunch of internet
00:01:22 creators. We do YouTube stuff. Some of us do comics, et cetera, et cetera. And here we are
00:01:27 talking about various topics in this show here on The Procrastinators Channel. And today we're
00:01:31 talking about transhumanism. Today we're talking about transhumanism. And if you don't know what
00:01:36 that is, luckily our boys over at Urban Dictionary have you covered. Let's give it a read. Okay,
00:01:42 that's a long one. I'm going to do the shorter secondary one. Hopefully this will be good.
00:01:45 Okay. A postmodern theory that posits on the perceived benefit to mankind of having a
00:01:52 Cuisinart installed in your rectum. Oh, I don't even know what a Cuisinart... Okay,
00:01:58 then let's talk. Let's do the top definition. Okay, here's one of the little more details.
00:02:04 This is the top definition. Transhumanism. A movement supporting the use of reason science
00:02:08 and technology to advance and enhance human abilities and existence under optimal conditions.
00:02:12 Can be seen as an extension of humanism, but with much more emphasis on the future. Transhumanists
00:02:16 believe that we should try to overcome our biological limitations through the use of such
00:02:20 things as nanotechnology, cryonics, AI, mind uploading, spacetime engineering, Jesus Christ,
00:02:25 eugenics. Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. And what not in order to become post-human. I don't understand
00:02:35 what that last part... I think that was a... The only thing I like about that list was the eugenics.
00:02:43 Oh, by the way, I just want to give a shout out to our heroes at Urban Dictionary to which the
00:02:47 PCPO is the entirety of its success. I just wanted to shout them out as their October 6th
00:02:52 word of the day was boy-splaining. Boy-splaining. It's mansplaining, but immature. That means that
00:03:02 mansplaining is mature. That means mansplaining is the mature thing to do. You fucked up, Urban
00:03:06 Dictionary. Isn't boy-splaining literally the entirety of the procrastinator's podcast?
00:03:12 I agree. That's a good point. So very relevant. So when transhumanism was brought up as a topic,
00:03:17 I was shocked that we haven't already done this, because I don't know about Hippo, but I know me
00:03:22 and Nate and Tom and probably DeVu are all very big transhumans. We all self-identify as transhumans,
00:03:34 for sure. Well, you know, we're not transhumans, but we're sympathetic to the cause. I don't think
00:03:43 any of us are augmented yet. You know, to some extent, I've heard people argue that human beings
00:03:50 as they exist now are semi-transhumans because we have our phones and stuff. Yeah, yeah. Well,
00:03:57 the thing I was going to say is I think we've already interrupted evolution, like the evolutionary
00:04:02 process of human time. Oh, no doubt. No doubt. So we're already off the beaten path. So I just
00:04:07 figured we might as well go full stop at this point. And I mean, when transhumanism gets brought up,
00:04:12 I feel like everybody imagines it as like robot parts attached to your body. But a lot of it's
00:04:17 way more than that. Of course. A lot of it's chemical. And we're all doing that shit. There is
00:04:22 nobody who is not ingesting some form of chemical that is performance altering in some way as to
00:04:29 how it's just caffeine. If you've got yourself kind of food, like actually, did you try to establish
00:04:36 smoking weed his new hobby as a transhumanist act? If you've got yourself a fly-ass, bomb-ass,
00:04:44 dope-ass hoe who you're nutting in regularly and she's taken that pill, that is her being a transhumanist.
00:04:50 That is her deviating from her biological intentions. So every time you nut in your lady,
00:04:55 just say, bitch, you're a robot now. That's what I do. That's the fact how I nut. I do. I feel like
00:05:01 I have to mention that I'm not really that into the future, the sci-fi. I'm more into the past
00:05:10 things, like aesthetically. But if transhumanism doesn't mean robot parts and it means all this
00:05:15 other stuff, then I don't know. Because I didn't know that. I always assumed it was like looking
00:05:20 way into the future to see all the cool stuff that was like, you know, flying cars attached to your
00:05:27 back. I know you're more into, I don't know. Well, you can be the surrogate for the audience.
00:05:36 We can dump our knowledge onto you. I think the reason I wanted to specify that, that it's not
00:05:41 far future, is because it's more interesting to think about the stuff that we can do soon,
00:05:47 you know, like the ways that we're already making progress. And a lot of the transhuman stuff I'm
00:05:52 most excited about is not just robot parts, but like, I don't want to have to sleep anymore.
00:05:56 When are we getting my anti-sleep pill, you know? Or when are we getting... Nate, I was glad you
00:06:02 brought up birth control, because I was thinking about this. I've been thinking about this all
00:06:07 fucking day about what I'm going to bring into this podcast. That I think transhumanism could
00:06:12 easily be mistaken as like a guy thing, because we all, you know, there's stereotype guys love
00:06:18 technology and we want to fucking have a robot android dong, you know? But I was thinking about how
00:06:23 there's already pills that can, for instance, make it so you don't have your period anymore,
00:06:28 and like fix PMS stuff. I feel like women would jump right the fuck on that.
00:06:34 It's in fact, it's far more common for, like, the whole idea of female birth control is like
00:06:41 deeply rooted now in at least western culture, but male birth control is like,
00:06:46 some movements actually oppose the very idea of it, which I think is sort of a play to like
00:06:52 keep the sexual power in the hands of women, but we can get into my red pillion over time.
00:07:00 Yes, so hippo, like I know you're more into the past, like pirates and shit, but in the future we
00:07:04 could potentially have pirates, but then also without polio ruining everyone's fun. So I'm
00:07:10 just saying, the future is really better for everyone. I know. I mean, I agree. I agree that
00:07:15 some things are bad about the way humans are and the things that we have to deal with, but I like
00:07:21 wood more than I like metal. That's just really what it comes down to. I like a pirate ship being
00:07:25 made of wood. I don't want to see pirates with guns get out. That's why apple wood texture
00:07:31 skimmed more quickly on everything. Wait, pirates always had guns. No, no, I mean, like, like,
00:07:34 modern day pirates are like, oh, the, you know, and I don't know. Like Somali pirates. Somali
00:07:39 pirates, yeah, they go on, they go on dinghies not filled with air and on ships made of metal,
00:07:44 with guns, get out of here. You know, I don't respect you because of that. If you had wooden
00:07:51 boats, maybe. On the, on the topic of just transhuman in general. Okay. So, so yeah, like,
00:07:57 I'm a gigantic fan of this. Like Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite things of all time.
00:08:00 And I want to talk at least at some length and I'm so, it's so cool to me that you brought up
00:08:06 like male versus women just because Motoko is just such a role model to me and just represents all
00:08:11 these great things about like Motoko is like a technological wizard who is like ahead of the
00:08:16 curve. Everyone behind her is like a regressive piece of shit. But Motoko is always thinking about
00:08:20 how to like adapt to the situation she's in. And that, that is inherent to a character as like
00:08:25 the best cyborg user or like one of the best out there. But what I wanted to say about this was
00:08:30 there's so many people when you bring up this topic, like are struck with such a deep level of
00:08:34 fear instantaneously. And I feel this is one of our like, this is one of our like biological
00:08:40 carryovers from when we were, you know, beasts of the field. It's one of our, it's just like this,
00:08:45 this instinct to be afraid of, of, of change really and of the unknown because like,
00:08:51 whenever I think about this stuff in general, I think about like, okay, we're going to,
00:08:56 we're going to do extensive testing and try to like, okay, if we want to invent like a microchip
00:09:01 that lets us talk to each other, you know, not, not psychically, but through the technology
00:09:04 implanted our heads, which people are working on actively right now. If you bring up that idea,
00:09:08 people are immediately like, Oh no, I don't want something in my head. Like, oh, imagine all the
00:09:12 things that could go wrong. And like, that's entirely true, which is why we will before like
00:09:17 making that technology available to extensive testing and try to avoid the very things that
00:09:23 people are afraid of. Well, here's the thing. This is what I think. I think the problem is that
00:09:27 we're all influenced by popular culture and technology is the current boogeyman that we
00:09:31 all like to think is going to go bad. Like that's been the boogeyman for the last like 20, 30 years.
00:09:35 Yeah, you know, even dumb, you go that and it's like, Oh, Terminator 2, Skynet, all that's just
00:09:40 going to happen. And I just think back to like before that, you know, like, like electricity
00:09:44 was the boogeyman. It's like, Oh, you got shocked by electricity and turned into a monster because
00:09:48 we don't understand how this works. So like electricity, no thing like that's gonna be
00:09:55 so much art and like fiction has a hard time like grappling with the fear, but still great
00:10:00 potential of future technology, you know, so much sci-fi stuff, even if part of the appeal of say a
00:10:05 sci-fi movie is about like showing off this cool technology, the script just cannot help but
00:10:09 constantly preoccupy itself with all the fucking things that can go wrong and scarcely showing you
00:10:15 why people adopted technology in the first place. And again, Ghost in a Shell standalone complex,
00:10:19 the series specifically does a great job. Just really it's not it is even handed. It talks about
00:10:24 cyber brain sclerosis, which is like a disease that no one could figure out caused by a cyber brain.
00:10:29 You're fucked, right? But it's but again, the real villain just in that situation is the fact
00:10:34 that the corporation invented a cure for it, but didn't want to implement it because it would
00:10:38 impact their bottom line too much. Again, just setting up a situation where technology isn't
00:10:43 what's evil. It's it's the greed of men. That's the real evil here. So like that's exactly what I
00:10:48 want to see in a story like that, you know, right? Like and like, like actually, I'm actually watching
00:10:52 an episode right now, like earlier today. I also heard an explanation that was like, well, they
00:10:56 couldn't figure out why the cure worked. So it wasn't approved for that reason. I don't. Anyway,
00:11:00 like I even recently watched the Ghost in a Shell movie, you know, the 1995 one, and even that portrays
00:11:05 the whole cyberization thing with a little bit more attention and like fear, because there's like
00:11:10 a scene where Matoko and Bato are sitting on a boat just like reflecting on how like they they
00:11:15 sure they feel really ambivalent, really mixed about their robot body. So they're like, oh man,
00:11:20 we're like so strong and everything. But like, we can't swim in water without sinking. And I'm
00:11:27 like, dude, what the fuck? Like, I guess I guess it might feel uncomfortable. You might constantly
00:11:31 feel weird about yourself. But Matoko in the in the series just seems to have not really any
00:11:36 serious issue. You know, she has trauma over the accident that required the robot body. In general,
00:11:40 it's like, dude, this is fucking awesome. And like, that's the attitude I have for technology. It's
00:11:44 like, oh, the internet. Oh, yeah. You know, early on it caused lots of creepy killers to run around.
00:11:48 I mean, that's still a thing. It has all those sorts of weird consequences of anonymity, fake news
00:11:53 and all that shit. But you look at what came before all news was fake news before the internet
00:11:56 because you had no way of knowing what the fuck was going on in the world. They don't know Obama.
00:12:00 So that's why the internet is ultimately the most like incredible for society and same way
00:12:07 cyberization. Yeah, it'll have problems and people who do not fucking respect the difference in
00:12:12 quality of life from before that invention came around will continuously naysay it the same way
00:12:16 that like so much like I think fantasy fiction looks back on like the 1600s and like, oh, no giant
00:12:21 corporations, no fucking worrying about bills. Yeah. And fucking every plague that could kill you
00:12:26 any single week with no soap to help you. No one makes fantasy stories with that shit.
00:12:33 I think I think the these things kind of go in cycles as they kind of like permeate popular
00:12:37 culture. I think at first it's like awe and wonder and mystique, then it goes to fear and then it
00:12:42 just becomes acceptance. And like a great example of this, I think is Star Trek. Because I think
00:12:46 the original series of Star Trek was like, when technology is so crazy, it's amazing. And imagine
00:12:50 all these things we could do with it, we could travel the stars and get solve all the problems we
00:12:52 can heal people instantly. And but by next generation, it's like, oh, now we have the Borg
00:12:57 and like how technology can be used, evilly. And then like Deep Space Nine had a lot of undertones
00:13:01 of like technology being bad too. And I think now it's just kind of like a technology is just
00:13:08 like a backdrop. Like, you know, you look at the Star Trek films and stuff, and there's no statement
00:13:12 on it at all. It's just there. And it's a part of it. And like, I mean, there's plot devices and
00:13:17 stuff. It's interesting. It's interesting, the emphasis that gets played on stories like that,
00:13:21 because like, yeah, like in JJ Abrams' Star Trek, like, there's basically no cycle of philosophical
00:13:28 discussions beyond like the big like, why is the big bad guy doing this? Oh, no, we blew up his
00:13:32 planet. He's getting vengeance. Like something like that, which is just, you know, bog standard,
00:13:36 like action story shit. Whereas like Ghost in the Shell. So like the 1995 movie that's the most
00:13:43 famous is, I don't know if I want to say this, okay, it is sort of in tone at least my least
00:13:49 favorite interpretation of like the Ghost in the Shell series, entirely because it was by far
00:13:55 the most negative tone like the technology in general. It is a very dour like emphasis. Whereas
00:14:02 what I love about every single other iteration, including a rise to some extent, is that those
00:14:07 ones like like Star Trek, like actually the JJ Abrams Star Trek, they sort of just fully embrace
00:14:14 the change that they showed. Okay, this is just a world where like cyborgs live among us and it's
00:14:19 just normal. There's nothing weird about this. And that is honestly, that is fucking progressive.
00:14:25 That is super progressive in a way that I absolutely love that it's just like, yeah, like, okay,
00:14:30 so I don't like, I don't know, I hate all Muslims. I hate all black people. I hate Jews, whatever.
00:14:35 But I accept people who have fucking like gigantic like, but that's not of me. That's me
00:14:44 a fictional character. What I'm saying, but it just like, so if you if you hate like races,
00:14:51 but you like like someone with a robotic fucking body or like full of cybernetic, like augmentations,
00:14:58 like on the progressive stale, that's you on the progressive scale, that's you being like
00:15:02 way, way more accepting of someone different from you, you know, so I don't know where I'm going
00:15:08 with that. But yeah, I hate minorities. That's the slogan you're going for is get nanomachines
00:15:16 become a Nazi net progressive. I want to say about the the the presentation of technology is
00:15:25 scary. I think a lot of it just comes from like needing drama in a story. Yeah, of like, if we're
00:15:31 going to make a story about sci fi and the whole point is the technology, then the question becomes,
00:15:36 well, how do we create tension? Well, what could go wrong with the technology? And it's kind of
00:15:40 unfortunate. And I also think that people focus so much on the downsides of something like, for
00:15:46 instance, the self driving cars, which are now a thing that's just out there. There's people just
00:15:51 on the road with self driving cars. And of course, the second there was a fatality in one of them,
00:15:57 because of the cars failure, it was like a huge uproar. And it's like, on the one hand, yes,
00:16:02 it is still scary that they are not perfect. However, you will probably die in an auto accident
00:16:10 driving your own car anyways. Like you're talking like near 100% chance. I mean,
00:16:16 did you know that there that that the odds of you getting into an axe in auto accident
00:16:22 is that you will get in one once every 15 years? Well, that is how it's not you have a one in
00:16:28 whatever chance it's you will be involved in an auto accident at least once every 15 years,
00:16:35 no matter how so when you have when you have one accident with self driving cars, it's like,
00:16:38 what are we pitching about again? You know, it's once it's become so you know, that's that's the
00:16:43 whole thing of people like being afraid people are afraid whenever they put their like their power
00:16:47 in the hands of something else, even if it is like statistically more reliable. Maybe there's a
00:16:54 yeah, it kind of adds in a degree of people's people's like imaginations can run wild when
00:16:59 they don't actually understand what's happening. So like, there's all this room to conspiratize
00:17:03 about like, Oh, like, let's say like, I don't know, like an Asian guy gets in an accident. It's like,
00:17:07 Oh, my God, the self driving company like car companies are trying to wipe out Asian Americans
00:17:12 and purify the white race in our nation. Holy shit. You said conspiratize that like some sort of
00:17:17 porno about who did 9 11. Like, yeah, it's Alex Jones x Milo Yiannopoulos. It's good shit. Yeah.
00:17:25 I don't yet. People that's just an instinct. There's a major instinct that people have to
00:17:29 be scared of the stuff. And honestly, I am too. I definitely I think it's just a human thing.
00:17:35 And I would really like to transhumanize that away. I would love to cut that part out to say
00:17:40 the solution would be just to somehow augment our brains to get rid of this primitive limitation
00:17:45 that no longer applies. Man, if only there was some topic we could talk about. It was all about
00:17:49 that. What would you think about like, like that being implemented as like, Oh, a special gas that
00:17:55 makes everyone like technology and never question it. And that you just send that gas out and then
00:18:01 people are like initially like, Oh, no, I'm being gas. And then they're like, Wait, this was a good
00:18:04 idea. That is a very interesting question. And there is a Futurama issue that deals with that
00:18:09 a Futurama episode. Remember that episode where they get a new robot in the office and Bender
00:18:14 like hates it. So he gets a compatibility upgrade. And what that manifests as is one of the most
00:18:19 interesting episodes. It manifests as Bender like goes to the place to get the upgrade. He then
00:18:25 seemingly chickens out and runs away runs to an island where he like rejects technology becomes
00:18:30 like a wood robot instead of fucking metal. Eventually, like he comes back to land to lead
00:18:34 an uprising. And in the uprising, like he gets hurt and is going to die, except he's saved by the
00:18:40 new robot and is like, I love the new robot now, only to then wake up for the dream that this all
00:18:45 was in the upgrade center. And it was revealed that yeah, like this, this is what the upgrade was
00:18:50 for him, which incidentally is how I think about the way that I became compatible with making fast
00:18:55 YouTube content. I went through this whole rigmarole just to end up at the very beginning
00:18:58 where it was like, Yeah, make daily content, make fast content. That's, that's what you gotta do.
00:19:02 Oh, I guess, I guess that's the same thing. Yeah. So I mean, it wasn't an illusion. It was just
00:19:07 real life. That's that's the difference. It doesn't matter. The point is, like,
00:19:12 that is a very interesting thing. And if we could put it in those terms, if we could do things like
00:19:17 that, I like it. I think I have a handful of different because you know, due to you talked
00:19:23 about the whole a need for drama, but it's also need for drama plus lazy creativity, not being
00:19:28 creative enough and coming up with something that can go wrong without undercutting the entire value
00:19:33 of having that innovation in the first place, right? So like, for example, something with like,
00:19:38 like say post scarcity society, where we can simulate anything at any point forever. I had the
00:19:42 idea of like a, we like basically all of humanity gets together to make some computers that will
00:19:46 make more computers, it'll keep making more computers until they make one that is absolutely
00:19:50 intelligent, morally flawless, and will never betray humanity, right? So they make one, and then
00:19:55 they start expanding and colonizing the galaxy or whatever. So it's like 10s of 1000s of years go by.
00:20:00 And most humans don't even know about this because this post scarcity society is terrifying to most
00:20:05 people. So like, you can learn about it if you if you if you find out about it. And then like,
00:20:09 if you end up really depressed about that, they'll just erase your memories and put you back in some
00:20:12 other simulation, right? So people are put into countless simulations where scarcity is artificialized,
00:20:17 but everyone ultimately is happy. Everyone's given a life where they are given the illusion that they
00:20:22 could fail and end up succeeding, right? Maybe even with lots of stimulated humans, like fake humans
00:20:27 or all who are like dying Africans to make you value your own self, right? And so in the story is
00:20:31 that this AI that's like colonizing a pretty decent chunk of the Milky Way at this point,
00:20:36 finds some other some other fucking force that's like incredibly powerful at some other life form
00:20:41 that's beyond anything that we can conceive. And so the robot needs to figure out like how to beat it
00:20:46 and starts running specific test driven tests on humans to figure out like their behavior and
00:20:52 learn things from them. And maybe there's like one main human character in the story who talks to
00:20:55 the AI directly. You're literally pitching a full sci fi novel right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so
00:21:01 basically the robot has because like maybe the robot can't 100% simulate everything that the human
00:21:06 soul is able to come up with. And there's just things about this abstract entity out in out in
00:21:10 space that he can't understand. So he has to like investigate the human animal and like try to
00:21:15 he spends thousands of years, hundreds of generations evolving certain people to find
00:21:19 an outlier who can represent the same weird trait that this galactic force has. And that's the main
00:21:25 character. Someone would like this trait that no one could ever possibly have without specific
00:21:28 breeding. And I don't know if that's the fucking beginning of the story. Okay. Kind of sounds like
00:21:32 Neo. He was like kind of born with this awareness of the world. Yeah. My version of Neo, he doesn't
00:21:39 even just see the world in like zeros and ones. He sees the world in zero, one, two and threes.
00:21:44 Like he sees like all the fucking numbers. Whoa. Sorry. Sorry. Go on, Tom. You can go. Oh, that was
00:21:52 me. I was going to say to get to give us some structure here and to get hippo talking as well.
00:21:59 I'm curious about what transhuman thing each of you wants the most like what what do you want
00:22:05 a realistic one within our lifetime? Yeah, like what if like what do you hope? Let's say they can
00:22:10 roll it out and then let's say that we are in the technological singularity. So this stuff's
00:22:15 getting rolled out really fast, you know, like what what's the one you want to come next?
00:22:21 Hippo, do you have any like any things you would want to transhumanize like right now?
00:22:26 Well, it's it's always weird for me because I'm not constantly thinking of everything that
00:22:30 I do as a human being being like something I could get rid of or would want to get rid of
00:22:35 because I don't know what it's like to not have it. So I guess something that would just make
00:22:41 my job easier like the ability to write with your mind like you would think words and then
00:22:46 they would just type come up on the page ergonomic keyboard. That would be so perfect for me when
00:22:51 I'm fucking high because I can't write anything but I have a thousand ideas. Yeah, to make them
00:22:58 come out of your head and also to organize them in a way that's readable afterwards. Yeah, yeah,
00:23:04 that would be pretty great. That's important. I want to I'll go into mine just so I can sort of
00:23:08 lay the like let let you guys know more of what I mean. Though that was a good one.
00:23:13 Um, what I want out of transhumanism is basically autopilot. Like because I like setting I love
00:23:22 autopay for instance, like having my bills set to just automatic payments every month, having
00:23:28 everything just work automatically so I don't have to think about it. And I would like it if
00:23:33 something like like my personal upkeep could just be automatic. Like I don't have to worry about
00:23:40 for instance brushing my teeth. I've just got nano bots that do that or my teeth are just not
00:23:45 something that has to be taken care of or like, you know, my hair and beard are just set at a
00:23:51 length and like I don't I don't have to do anything basically. I can just do my job and not worry about
00:23:58 like constantly falling behind on personal upkeep because I'm too distracted by everything else.
00:24:04 That's what I want. Like first, you know, on on that front, you know how that when when you're
00:24:09 in a coma, they actually they sort of exercise your body for you. They stretch your muscles and
00:24:13 they move you so you don't get like bed sores as well as like keep you alive and able to function
00:24:17 once you come back. Like the exercising takes a lot of fucking time and a lot of concentration
00:24:22 and focus to do it right. But yeah, man, I'm totally with you. Like I mean, I know you can
00:24:30 there is a lot to be learned from working out like about self discipline and there's a lot of
00:24:34 good things that come from it. But like when you're in a position like I am where your life's
00:24:40 pretty figured out. And it's not that I lack the discipline per se so much as like I want to do
00:24:46 other things and I it takes up a lot of fucking time and energy, you know, and it doesn't always
00:24:51 leave you in the in a state where you can then perform sitting in a chair for the next eight
00:24:56 hours. That's an interesting thing about it's an interesting thing about that because like if
00:25:06 if things are just like easy for everyone to do, you know, the thing like having a perfect physique
00:25:13 or or whatever it stops being special and then everyone can have it and also like the discipline
00:25:18 thing if all these like transhumanist things are like, like, should they be expensive? Should they
00:25:23 be like this some sort of like you have to be a certain age or you have to prove that you're worth
00:25:29 all this stuff? Or is it just giving it to everyone? Like what's the moral thing? I think
00:25:37 I don't know. It's interesting to to the idea of like we'd all end up the same or it would stop
00:25:42 being special because that just means that the only people who are going to do it are people who
00:25:45 want it for like real like, I mean, everyone should be healthy because that's just better for
00:25:52 everybody. Yeah, it's not a hard decision, but still most people don't make it. That wasn't really
00:25:56 my point. I was just saying it, but like, like, I don't know. I feel like some people,
00:26:03 they don't, they don't all deserve all the like benefits of technology as like, I don't know. I
00:26:10 feel like there's some sort of a barrier to get into that. I think it'll make people better though,
00:26:15 like like people who, well, another thing I would really want is some kind of, you know,
00:26:22 we need ways to like control our minds better, I think. Like it would be nice if we had a
00:26:27 transhumanist way to, I don't know, alleviate insanity. Like I just feel like there is a risk
00:26:35 if like everybody becomes the same person or something. But like I feel like as we approach,
00:26:40 it would just be a change in like what we value. Like I mean, there was once a time where everybody
00:26:45 was healthy, you know, like because you had to be or else you fucking died. So like, well, okay,
00:26:50 maybe not, maybe help me like, yeah, I fit. Yeah. There was a time where there wasn't
00:26:56 fat slobs everywhere, you know, right? True. True. And it didn't, it didn't mean that
00:27:03 everybody has to do the same thing. It just means you can change your focus elsewhere. Like a guy
00:27:07 who, like there's some people who are way into fitness and that's their whole identity. But if
00:27:11 fitness was just something taken care of, they would probably just do something else. You know,
00:27:15 like that just wouldn't, it just wouldn't be something that is somebody's identity. But
00:27:19 something else might be, something that we didn't know we had time for. My answer to your whole
00:27:23 question about, about what you would, what you would do, what I would do, what I would want the
00:27:28 most out of like a quick rollout of transhumanism would be another way to do the same thing,
00:27:32 essentially, which is also an expansion of what Hippo said, which is just having a computer
00:27:37 screen I can see and control mentally, then I would never, I could just go for a walk all day
00:27:42 and get all my work done. That would be the tits. I love that idea. But for me,
00:27:48 like in all sci-fi stories, that is the thing I least can believe is like controlling things with
00:27:54 your mind, because your mind doesn't work that straightforwardly. You know, like at least my
00:27:59 thoughts, they don't occur in like a narrative way. It's not like, it's not impossible to control,
00:28:05 because like I've seen disabled people with like robotic arms that are controlled with like wires
00:28:10 into their brain. I feel like if we have the ability to control our, like our bodies to the
00:28:15 level of precision that we do, like just if you move all your fingers at once, like I'm doing
00:28:18 right now, like that's a lot of precise control that I have. I feel like it is possible. It might
00:28:24 actually take a lot of effort to do like as a person. I'm just wondering like if, let's say I'm
00:28:28 typing with my mind, is it going to only type the things that I want to be typed or is it going to
00:28:34 type every fucking word that's in my head of which there are thousands? The assumption is that you'll
00:28:40 get a little extra, a little chip, a little tiny bit of a little brain matter that will take care
00:28:44 of all that. Just like, yeah, just the same computer codes can now be thought. The way I would assume
00:28:50 it would work or that I imagine is that you're not like thinking a word like in your head the way
00:28:56 you would think a word now. You're imagining or controlling a pretend arm typing on a pretend
00:29:02 keyboard. Right, because when you're typing, you're still thinking of the end words you want to type.
00:29:06 So this is just taking those motor actions and translating them into the head screen itself.
00:29:14 You're using that same thought process like, okay, now I'm going to type this sentence after I've
00:29:18 thought about what it's going to be and instead of changing that into a physical motor action,
00:29:23 you're just directly putting it onto whatever this display is. But hey, ultimately we are talking
00:29:29 about fiction. I'm prepared to say like, yeah, we could figure that out. That seems fair to
00:29:35 you. Did you want to add anything else or can I go? No, that was it. Okay. Mine is a little bit
00:29:42 further out and possibly not even real or could be done. But what I want the most is I want the
00:29:50 ability to detach consciousness from the physical body. And that could mean either to like physically
00:29:56 body swapping so that I can be a big slut and fuck dudes. That'd be cool. Or like the ability to
00:30:05 sort of, and this is like next level shit, but like uploading your consciousness to the cloud,
00:30:10 to the internet. I don't know what that's like. If you could have an android body, if we could swap
00:30:15 our brain into someone else's body, would anyone in here remain male? Because I know I would not.
00:30:20 Well, not all the time, certainly not. Long term, I would want to remain male. I mean, I do like
00:30:25 being a guy. I would reevaluate what it even means to be male in a world with that where
00:30:30 that is the case. So would everyone. But I'm pretty happy being male right now. I would probably be
00:30:35 both. I don't see any reason why not to be both. Like at the same time, I mean, the body would just
00:30:41 both. Everyone in the future will just have a dick and tits and it'll be great. I wonder if after
00:30:46 you do the other one, if you'll be like, actually, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Like once you've
00:30:51 been it, will it just change your perception of it entirely? I'm sure it's gonna end sexism. It's
00:30:57 great. I'm sure it'll have an effect. You know, though, what this does make me think of a lot
00:31:02 is the I give brought this up a little bit. Like if this stuff gets implemented to some degree,
00:31:07 imagine the incredible gap that will develop between people who have this shit and people who don't.
00:31:13 I think that's probably the most terrifying part. And there are times when I'm always wondering,
00:31:17 like, do the super elite already have transhumanist benefits that we just don't?
00:31:23 Maybe, man. Maybe. See, I'm not afraid of that because I'll be in the transhuman camp and I'll
00:31:29 have a rocket launcher in my arm. And so if all the if all the proletariat are like, we're gonna
00:31:34 overthrow you because you fucking pieces of shit, I'll just be like, and kill all the more people.
00:31:41 Yeah. Classes and boys.
00:31:46 I think in order to be in that camp, you need more than 350,000 subscribers. I think the wealth
00:31:51 gap is a little bit bigger than that. Pewdiepie is gonna be the only robot YouTuber. He's gonna
00:31:58 go around assassinating the media. Yeah, and the media. He's gonna upload a video where he gets
00:32:07 some people in like a third world country uploading death to all flesh bags and he's gonna
00:32:11 gasp like, how could they say that? Indeed. I look forward to the racial slurs that develop
00:32:17 for transhumanists. It's gonna be fun. We're really talking about the boringest parts of
00:32:21 future novels. Like, oh, the despair. Oh, the weird weird words we come up with. Yeah, okay,
00:32:25 skip this chapter. Well, yeah, but like the whole like poor thing, like I assume if we have like
00:32:32 all this super technology, we'd get to a point like where there's no reason we couldn't give it to
00:32:38 everyone, but then my problem would be if we're still operating under that kind of model. Yeah.
00:32:44 If capitalism is still real, like why would we give it to them? And it's possible that like
00:32:51 nothing that someone who doesn't have these abilities could ever do could like get them to a
00:32:55 place where they can like afford to do this. I'm just wondering at that point, if we get to the
00:32:58 point where you can literally, you know, have a cybernetic body, we get technology to that
00:33:04 degree, like would we even have problems with like means of production at that point? Like I
00:33:10 can't even see capitalism. Those are separate issues. This is addressed in an interesting way
00:33:16 in a show that the first half of which is amazing. The second half is a dumpster fire called Cado
00:33:23 where an alien life form shows up on earth and he's trying to advance humanity as fast as
00:33:27 possible, basically. And so he comes bearing gifts and the first gift he gives them is these
00:33:31 little orbs that have infinite energy. And he's like, he's like, I want everyone in the world to
00:33:37 have this, but like the government and what's it called the United Nations are like, we want to
00:33:44 have control over it and have sanctions. So basically he teaches people how to just make them, like
00:33:50 how to make these balls, so everyone can have it. And he was like, what these people don't
00:33:54 the government's not understanding is they're worried about like this being an arms race or
00:33:58 a power struggle. But the fact is, if everyone has it, there's no need to fight over it. Like
00:34:04 everyone can have this. That's true and all, but it is possible. Like if everyone had nukes
00:34:09 right now, it's possible like North Korea, if they had overwhelming power would just destroy
00:34:14 everyone else. So that is a real concern to have. So I'm with the UN right now, but okay, go on.
00:34:20 No, that was it. That's all I had to say.
00:34:25 That show goes right. It doesn't, it does not continue to explore this amazingly interesting
00:34:29 situation it's created. It turns into a terrible action show.
00:34:35 Talking about that in regards to say like scarcity, right? For example, we're entering
00:34:40 a situation where more and more shit is automated and people are concerned about humans having jobs.
00:34:46 The thing is, every time a robot replaces a job, it makes living on the earth a little bit cheaper.
00:34:53 Like imagine we just have robots for like everything, we have robots that construct a house
00:34:57 and like refurbish it. And also the robots deliver the pieces of that house to the building site.
00:35:03 And also robots mind and cut down the resources from planet Earth to make those parts. So if
00:35:09 everything is done through robots, let's say even the administration of the business is done through
00:35:13 robots, then the only thing you're having to pay for is the energy spent operating the robots,
00:35:19 which the robots could themselves be mining for making even the obtainment of energy resources
00:35:23 really cheap. Meaning in a society where everything's done by robots, basically,
00:35:27 there's not necessarily much need for money if we just skip straight to the far future. But the
00:35:33 problem is that moving into that progress is sort of blocked or clogged up by like laws and social
00:35:40 standards that are in place to keep people from getting jipped out of work or finances. Stuff like
00:35:44 the minimum wage, like for all it does to help people not get fucked over, it also kind of
00:35:48 fucks over progress in a lot of ways. And yeah, you know, you're not wrong. It's a complex thing.
00:35:56 Yeah, transition to that. Everything about the way our system, at least in America right now,
00:36:00 is adapted for the current situation we found ourselves in. Well, I guess you got to actually
00:36:04 argue it's adapted for one like 50 years ago that we're still trying to catch up to right now with.
00:36:08 But probably even before that. But nonetheless, like you're entirely right. This getting to these
00:36:12 positions is going to be a very difficult struggle in a very, you know, transition period where people
00:36:19 are displaced. That's right. That's right. What if what if what if Rick and Morty was real?
00:36:27 Hey, Rick's got a robot body sometimes. That's pretty cool. It's pretty cool.
00:36:32 That'd be cool. Tom, you haven't answered this yet, have you?
00:36:36 I have not answered it yet. Right, right. I mean, I guess mine's just really fucking petty
00:36:40 compared to everybody else's. The one thing I'd want is to just like, I've always been disgusted
00:36:45 and ashamed in the fact that our flesh and blood bodies are so fragile. Like it's just like, oh,
00:36:53 like you have like, one heart and if it something happens to it, you're fucked, like we can kind
00:36:59 of hopefully stitch something in there, but you got to wait around and it's not a good chance,
00:37:03 like, like it just blows my mind that we can't just swap it out. So if we're going to do transhumanism,
00:37:08 what I think the first thing that should happen is either nanomachines that can
00:37:14 enhance and repair organs so bodies don't die and don't break down literally metal gear rising
00:37:21 nanomachines. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. I mean, it just that just seems like
00:37:26 the most logical thing because like, I long term, I would like to have a fully synthetic body,
00:37:31 not necessarily like something out of like Deus Ex Human Revolution where they just literally
00:37:35 attach metal arms onto me after sawing off my normal ones because like Deus Ex is a great example
00:37:42 of like why that doesn't really work because like in the world of Deus Ex, in the original game,
00:37:47 they have nanomachines, like that's the current technology. So like the main character,
00:37:51 JC Denton, he walks around, he looks pretty much like a regular guy, but his entire body is augmented
00:37:56 with nanotechnology. The whole point of Deus Ex 1 is that it's like, oh man, you've seen
00:38:02 robot guys, but this is a guy who's robot just as small, he looks like a normal guy,
00:38:06 but then you're telling me the later Deus Ex games from the following century regressed on that
00:38:12 idea? Come on, it's twenty fifteen people. The other games are prequels to the first one.
00:38:18 Yeah, they take place, I think, twenty years beforehand. So maybe a prequel to a futuristic
00:38:25 story is a dumb idea. I thought it was actually really interesting. I think it worked very well
00:38:29 because like the idea in like the original Deus Ex is obviously it's talking about augmentation
00:38:35 and stuff in general, but it also has this interesting idea of like we have all these clunky
00:38:39 big robot dudes walking around that like at the time that was like the shit and what you were
00:38:45 supposed to do, but now like you can't, they can't get the nanomachines in the way that normal people
00:38:49 being born now can because they already hacked off the regular limbs. So there's this dichotomy
00:38:55 of like now they're second-class citizens where before they weren't because they can never take
00:38:59 advantage of this new technology the way that people now can. And then in Deus Ex Human Revolution
00:39:04 it's talking about the impact on current society of having augmentations becoming something in
00:39:10 the beginning. You could already see in those games the foreshadowing of like the nanomachines
00:39:14 technology coming because obviously the series has that in its lore already. So it's two different
00:39:18 kind of conflicts, but that's like I just it just seems to me the Deus Ex original game that's kind
00:39:25 of like the robot body I'd want or like the cyber brain robot body out of Ghost in the Shell. That
00:39:31 just makes more sense because I think it's just it's more advanced in general like I wouldn't
00:39:35 want to have this big giant fucking hulking arm because like the main character in Deus Ex Human
00:39:40 Revolution his tech looks really like slick and nice and shit, but that's because like it's the
00:39:44 most expensive fucking crazy shit they goodbye. Normal people walking around that you talk to
00:39:49 look like fucking Gundams and not in a good way. That sounds kind of dope, but you know once we get
00:39:55 once we get really deep into this shit like like remember in Ghost in the Shell how there was like
00:40:00 the president of one of the companies is just like a dude in a fucking box with like tiny little
00:40:06 like that's like the coolest thing ever. Dude I wanted to talk about this because you said like
00:40:11 eventually you want to disconnect consciousness from physical bodies and this is something I
00:40:15 think about a lot because I love transhumanism as a concept, but the thing that I always wonder
00:40:18 is like what's the end game? We're going to keep pushing this forward and forward and forward
00:40:22 and the end game seems to inevitably be to abandon physical reality entirely in my opinion. I think
00:40:27 that sort of or make the form that you that you sort of host in like it could be anything.
00:40:32 My my my thing is like what if you just existed digitally like what if you just there was no
00:40:39 like the physical because like no matter how much we like augment ourselves with like human
00:40:45 like like humanoid cybernetic bodies or whatever even just like non-human cybernetic bodies we're
00:40:49 still limited by being physical of having mass of taking up space and so like if you lived completely
00:40:55 digitally like think about it this way when you're on the internet and you go to a website you don't
00:41:00 have to travel from google physically to the next website you just go there what if like that's how
00:41:06 travel in general works like if you were just digital like first of all there'd be no need for
00:41:12 construction because everything could be made instantaneously because it's digital so there's
00:41:16 no worrying about resources resources are finite or infinite not finite anymore you're not dealing
00:41:20 with finite resources like oh someone needs a house just drop in the house.exe and it just builds it
00:41:25 so like there's nothing to deal with that. The thing with all that and this is this is like the
00:41:31 line I draw because digital enhancing your body so that you can do things in the you know in the
00:41:38 real world way better you know getting rid of the the need to sleep and all that sort of stuff
00:41:44 that's fine but when you start talking about living entirely as digital beings I'm like well a digital
00:41:51 being doesn't need a house he doesn't need anything he may as well have just killed himself.
00:41:57 Well no no that might my point is that when we get to this point of being a physical of being of
00:42:02 abandoning physical reality entirely if we get to that point well you have to actually wonder like
00:42:06 can our brains even cope with that because if you're not a physical being anymore and let's
00:42:12 why would you get in your car and drive to work why would you even have a concept of like buildings
00:42:17 and roads you would just you would just be like energy basically a consciousness that exists
00:42:22 and like could the human brain which has kind of obviously evolved to deal with the limitations
00:42:27 of physical reality adapt itself to a reality where I can't comprehend it of being just like
00:42:33 thoughts and math or like thoughts and consciousness that kind of just can
00:42:37 sift and move around somehow and interact with other things like I don't even know how to work
00:42:40 it's beyond clearing my comprehension. That's why I'm gonna actually lay down an actual like solid
00:42:45 like a die in the wall or lie in the sand prediction right you see people in the past be
00:42:49 like oh yes eventually computers may only be the size of two refrigerators by the year 2000 you
00:42:55 know but in some people who hit it right on the fucking money you know like oh man this whole
00:42:59 internet thing I think it's gonna bring us all together and it also isolate us and create weird
00:43:04 anonymous people right some people are out on the money so I'm gonna I'm gonna take my chance right
00:43:08 my prediction as I sort of alluded to but earlier is that when we inter-post scarcity be it because
00:43:13 we all become digital concepts or because we have 3d printers and intergalactic travel and
00:43:17 and we have like nanomachines that protect our bodies forever one way or another once we enter
00:43:22 actual true post scarcity it's only a matter of watching those rpgs rts stat bars on the galaxy
00:43:29 go up waiting for that resources to be mined from our solar system and other stars when we get to
00:43:35 that point my prediction is that people will have a mass exodus from actual awareness of lucidity
00:43:44 right of everyone will just go into simulations right be it actually constructing a simulation
00:43:49 and like living in it or just building a program you know like like 1950s american housewife.exe
00:43:54 boom you now think that's you your memories are totally altered and like once that simulation
00:43:59 of you version dies and you become conscious again you're like oh okay so now i'm gonna do this or
00:44:03 that we just come up with all sorts of weird fucking lives for us to have and you know and
00:44:07 we just exist like that forever and ever and ever and that's basically it I think that basically
00:44:12 works my my just feel like what's the point like why would why would any of that ever exist for
00:44:18 anyone my concern is that like if you upload yourself to the cloud then there is there just is no
00:44:24 more you you are just part of the cloud it's just well the cloud is just everybody it's just a
00:44:29 collective conscious because like you have all the information there is you know like if you
00:44:35 are a part of the information then like basically you know what everyone else is thinking because
00:44:41 it's all in the cloud you know like you've basically you're just a part of the the overall
00:44:47 partitions if you want there to be it's not you have to I mean they would they would have to be
00:44:51 heavy partitions for it to mean anything to a human going into the divisions between individuality
00:44:56 wouldn't be the access to information would be the interpretation of it because that's how
00:45:00 information works right now you can give two people the same information they can extrapolate
00:45:04 completely different results well okay you know i talked about like computer brains right so human
00:45:08 brains right now is a computer that is always running right is all even in a coma it's always
00:45:14 constantly going through its program loop right and whereas you know a hard drive or a program on
00:45:18 a floppy disk or whatever can just be inert right all the data is there but it's not moving so you
00:45:23 could program something on a floppy disk to be like oh man when i'm running i want to eat food
00:45:27 food.exe where the fuck can i get my food right but if it's just the floppy disk not being run
00:45:31 it's inert data not moving it's not alive right so presumably if you want an accurate if we're if
00:45:37 we're already assuming that we're having accurate representations of the human brain one prerequisite
00:45:43 is that we're already running right we're not just data on a floppy disk because then we're dead until
00:45:47 someone boots us back up right so if we are running then presumably if it's an accurate
00:45:51 representation of the human mind there is going to be a hey i need uh more of my fucking food value
00:45:58 can i please get my food variable please can i please get my human comfort variable i need it
00:46:03 right so for me it's i don't know i feel like that's kind of like a really obtuse
00:46:07 his hair here's my ex let me give you my expectation of uh my final form of transhumanism
00:46:15 that i imagine and even longer beard that the despair the disparity will be pretty massive
00:46:21 because even right now like think about the information disparity between someone who like
00:46:28 not only has a smartphone but uses it all day to use the internet to access all the worldly
00:46:33 information and like someone in like a tribal society in africa or something like the information
00:46:40 disparity is unbelievably i just imagine people in that tribe yeah well i imagine that people in
00:46:45 some tribes out in the world like literally have no concept of what the world is at this point
00:46:54 you know like there's no way to bridge the information gap that's at that scale so i'm
00:47:01 imagining that yes there will be a way to have a partitioned mind in a machine the people with
00:47:07 the partition minds they're going to be the uh Babylon like it's just people fucking around
00:47:15 like like people just my mind's in a computer and i can do anything now you know like my life's
00:47:21 going to be nothing but fucking sluts all day like that's that's the partitioned minds
00:47:25 then you have the people who join the collective cloud conscience who all mind meld into one being
00:47:30 and they're the ones who within like a year solve how to get off the planet and they fuck off
00:47:36 and they're like look humans y'all got a choice you can either mind meld with us and get the
00:47:41 fuck off this planet or you guys can hang out here until the planet explodes and we're all like
00:47:46 you know what giving up my individuality scares me too much so i'm not joining the
00:47:50 cloud i guess i mean i don't digi it's very it's very interesting digi that you refer that you
00:47:55 use the word babel on there because i think that is a very accurate word to use uh because you know
00:48:00 tower of babel on and all that and what this this whole discussion what we're what we're kind of
00:48:04 with our ape like understanding in our in our our you know crude human matter brushing up against
00:48:09 at the top of this is like where does what what lies above the consciousness that we now have what
00:48:14 happens when we all meld ourselves into a greater collective that has all the processing power of
00:48:19 the entire species and i like i that is entirely what the end of the you know of course the most
00:48:25 famous most successful ghost in the shell movie is all about because that's exactly what happens
00:48:30 with the puppeteer the puppeteer you know access if find some way to access like to basically upload
00:48:36 him herself itself whatever to like this network and motoko briefly briefly experiences what that
00:48:42 would be like and in both the manga and the anime in the movie rather like she basically sees the
00:48:48 face of god for a second it's it's it's portrayed in this angelic way and i think that is a fascinating
00:48:54 way to interpret it because i don't care about religion at all i think it's bullshit and god
00:48:57 doesn't exist but i'm happy to accept that what people think religion is and think god is could
00:49:03 just be some higher level understanding that maybe maybe in history sometimes people have tapped
00:49:08 into for brief moments it's it's possible in some weird way that i don't understand i mean the
00:49:12 point of it is i don't think to vote the point of it is there is a higher level of consciousness
00:49:17 than what we have it might not be anything like what we think existence or consciousness is right
00:49:22 now but there is something above it maybe it's even just so much consciousness and processing
00:49:27 power in a place that it makes like our like like her basically exactly like her where everything we
00:49:32 experience now is like incredibly slow motion and incredibly basic compared to what that that thing
00:49:38 can process and to become a part of that is to completely lose what you were before and to
00:49:42 become something just godlike yeah you know like okay so the whole thing about like the collective
00:49:47 right i'm gonna like really like like shit on the idea of a collective i guess ironically
00:49:51 according to the memes but like uh fucking what i understand about computer hardware i don't know
00:49:58 of anything i don't know like i guess there might be some big old fucking matrix somewhere in some
00:50:02 facility that people have been constructing i guess but like the the actual internet is not
00:50:07 like that at all the actual internet is just a bunch of different servers with a bunch of
00:50:10 different fucking wires you know there was one time not too long ago where some fishermen just
00:50:15 dropped a big fuck off anchor uh down to the ocean i happened to snap a particular uh ocean line
00:50:22 and like some random south american nation was without internet for like a couple of days because
00:50:26 they had to fix that right there is no like central place where everything is everything is like
00:50:32 like uh f to p or whatever no no it's like it's like torrents right it's just one thing
00:50:37 pure yeah peer to peer yeah one thing go into another thing go into another thing right you're
00:50:42 entirely right you're entirely right it's like what exactly would be this collective i'm not saying
00:50:46 you couldn't very easily construct okay here's just like a basic version the basic version of what
00:50:52 i'm sort of describing here is like okay what if you could just access the internet from your brain
00:50:56 at any time like that's like the first step it would be like okay now i just like know everything
00:51:01 now i just i know everything so this is this is different now i i am a different person than
00:51:04 what it was before i knew everything and that's just like the first time what if you could then
00:51:08 communicate with everyone in real time instantly in addition to knowing everything okay it's
00:51:13 essentially oh that's what you mean different essentially you already know everything on the
00:51:18 internet if you count flipping out your phone and then reading it into your eyes as knowing it
00:51:22 because essentially your phone with its access to the internet is essentially a memory bank that
00:51:27 just takes longer to up to to to get into your server than uh than just having it in your brain
00:51:32 directly would be yeah that's kind of an interesting thing how like the definition of of memory works
00:51:36 like that like uh i was actually thinking recently like if someone did like a like a memory swap thing
00:51:41 where suddenly you have like let's say a memory edition right let's say you like invade someone's
00:51:46 brain and you have all their memories and now you have control of them right i'm like would you
00:51:50 just suddenly you wouldn't have like the sudden moment where you suddenly remember everything
00:51:53 about their lives it's rather let's say you get up in their room right you look at your kitchen
00:51:58 you're like oh hey i suddenly know where everything is you remember each thing as you need it so
00:52:02 essentially being part of this that's how memory works yeah you just you just be able to know what
00:52:07 when you need to know it so you could very well still have a pretty big disparity of intelligence
00:52:11 regarding like how well you can like actually interpret all of that information so yeah okay
00:52:18 that makes a fucking interesting thought um i always imagine the cloud is like a beowulf cluster
00:52:23 of brains like at the end of psychopaths oh yeah like sorry i well i don't know it's usually just
00:52:32 down to the question of are you willing to just go into this unknown thing because nobody can
00:52:37 nobody in an ai digital form will be able to accurately explain to you exactly what it feels
00:52:43 like in the lifespan of a human they just can't do it so you have to just take a you know jump in
00:52:50 or just really interesting hippo because the stuff you're the way you're describing it is exactly what
00:52:55 the first episode of serial experiments lane is about which is where a character kills herself
00:53:00 so that she can be only exist in the cloud and she's basically like mass emailing people telling
00:53:06 them like you should come here because it's it's the most liberating feeling like it changes
00:53:11 what you are and basically lane ends up following her into the cloud based on sheer curiosity about
00:53:17 like what is it like to have that you know that's true i mean you know personally i i when it comes
00:53:23 to that question i am not convinced that it would be better i'd be terrified if my life if my life
00:53:34 was terrible and i was gonna kill myself anyway i would do it by jumping into a digital big old
00:53:40 computer thing right sure yeah that's like actually i'd like to like bring the whole discussion
00:53:43 over to that idea if we could is like let's think realistically like forgetting your ideology and
00:53:48 actually incorporating what level of fear or you know inertia you have inhibitions you have an
00:53:53 adopting potentially dangerous untested technology or not completely tested on the actual public you
00:53:58 know we live in a fucking note seven society here technology that you know could end up having
00:54:03 unforeseen consequences like what would you actually do as a preventative measure or like
00:54:08 how quickly would you adopt it based on the information i'll i'll tell you for me like
00:54:14 i even right now even though i made the case for why it's safe earlier i still would be
00:54:21 uncomfortable driving a self-driving car indeed the only way i'd be comfortable enough is if
00:54:26 most people were doing it basically i'm a fucking sheep is what i'm saying like i will probably never
00:54:31 be an early adopter no i'm not because i want it to be i want it to already be perfect by
00:54:36 the time i get there and agree it's a different thing to be an early adopter when like okay there's
00:54:41 a new phone out okay i'm gonna rush in be the early adopter as opposed to like my fucking car uh you
00:54:45 know that's like it's a different level of state partly partly it's because i will i won't learn
00:54:51 everything about it i want someone else to be i want it to be something that like because let's
00:54:56 say you you fuck up your smart car how many people can fix it you know like how many people
00:55:02 understand what's wrong with it do you know what's wrong with it you know even people who know cars
00:55:06 won't know what's wrong with it you'll have to go to tesla the google corporation you know if it's
00:55:11 if it was everywhere if it's gotta imagine the google algorithm oh tom you took the fucking algorithm
00:55:17 right out of my mouth yeah like and even with smartphones you know i didn't come in until
00:55:26 the fucking note three was like my first smartphone like i because it wasn't prolific enough that i
00:55:32 immediately understood it and it was only once everyone had one and i got what you could do
00:55:38 it was basically the day i saw somebody playing super mario 64 on a phone that i went okay this
00:55:44 technology has come too far for me to ignore it anymore you know right on the bell curve you're
00:55:49 like you're the you're the late majority slash laggard when it comes to things in general i would
00:55:53 say um i would say early majority of depending on what the technology is and what i think my
00:56:00 use for it will be like for instance if we start having optic implants you know my eyes i'm afraid
00:56:05 about my eyes like sometimes my eyes hurt for no reason and i feel like it would might be better if
00:56:10 i had specialized you know like if that technology if the technology gets rolled out where like some
00:56:18 people have augmented eyes and then now there's an entire new field of film that you can only watch
00:56:24 if you have specialized and and my favorite animators are working in that field like that's
00:56:29 where i'm going to start getting convinced you know you got to draw me in you got to make me
00:56:34 think that my life's going to be better than it is and i'm fairly happy with my life so like i don't
00:56:39 need i'm i'm definitely someone i'm someone who's more like willing to take a chance if like if
00:56:44 it intrigues me i'd probably do it i think the problem for me would be cost because i have no
00:56:48 fucking money but uh in terms of willingness yes the the interesting thing is like is there a line
00:56:53 this is a question i wanted to bring up to people because it definitely is for me is there
00:56:56 a line that you won't cross is there some if they is there some sort of transhumanism that you
00:57:01 feel like no i'm not going that far what is my life right now because if like hippo said if i'm
00:57:06 depressed and everything's going wrong fuck it throw me in the cloud like if my life is miserable
00:57:11 especially like let's say i became like a vegetable or something oh yeah do do anything to me like
00:57:17 fucking get me out of here like i don't need to be in this body anymore but like if i'm as i am now
00:57:22 where my individuality means a lot to me it's difficult for me to imagine just giving that up
00:57:28 for you know for the documented thing that people don't change that much once they're past a certain
00:57:34 age so even if right now i began to see like the entire population of the earth adapt to let's just
00:57:39 say i augmentations everyone's getting robot eyes to then to sell myself on the idea of going into
00:57:45 the doctor having him literally cut the eyeballs out of my fucking skull to replace them with something
00:57:51 else i'm just saying it would be a hard sell because i don't know anyone who's had their eyeballs
00:57:55 cut out of their fucking skull i've never seen it done like like it's gotta be because it's gonna be
00:58:01 an incredibly expensive procedure and if it's not expensive i don't want it because they're gonna
00:58:05 fuck it up like i want the best scientists in the fucking world uh augmenting my eyes you know
00:58:12 it better not be some fucking quack doctor yeah for me unless the technology is that easy yeah man
00:58:16 when you imagine imagine when this technology is finally out all the fucking my vision is augmented
00:58:21 memes that would resurface dude like so for me there'll be a whole new class of of memes you
00:58:27 could only understand with those eyes oh just like just like fucking uh what's that what's that movie
00:58:31 with the obey and shit they live it'd be a whole thing live meme scape there'd be reddit posted
00:58:36 everywhere it's about weighing the different levels of risk and weighing the different
00:58:41 levels of value so like you know if uh if they got nanomachines that make you swear hey if you
00:58:47 fall a 50 foot gap you come off with a scratch or get hit by a car you might have a broken bone
00:58:52 right and it's like oh there's there's like 10 reports of someone randomly dying from those
00:58:56 nanomachines every year i'm gonna go for that you know because life is dangerous never knowing
00:59:00 you could fucking fall on die right so i think i'd go for that assuming it's not too expensive
00:59:04 if there's something that's like a little a little dude you know that if if nanomachines came into
00:59:08 existence and like the death rate in the world dropped from like 100 million to like 10 people
00:59:15 be like oh fuck those nanomachines man they're killing people out there they're fucking killing
00:59:19 people that's humans for you that's humans for you yeah i mean the thing the thing that the line
00:59:24 that i wouldn't cross for me personally and maybe as if time goes on and technology gets more advanced
00:59:30 that our understanding improves i could be swayed on this because i'm i'm willing to say that could
00:59:34 be swayed on anything really if you present a good enough argument i know what you're gonna say
00:59:38 jewe technology i hear you know i cannot i cannot cross that you got me no um i is i would be more
00:59:46 than willing to have my my body augmented as long as i knew it was safe i would have the
00:59:50 willing to have my brain augmented if i knew it was safe the one thing i just don't i don't think
00:59:55 i would ever feel comfortable doing unless you gave me a really solid argument would be would be um
01:00:02 to have like my my consciousness copied onto a computer because i think i think that your you're
01:00:08 still alive in your brain so like you can enhance that as much as you want but as soon as you like
01:00:13 kill my brain like i'm dead a copy of me is existing so are you saying are you uncomfortable
01:00:19 with the idea of just like there's you and then they make a copy and then there's two of you or
01:00:23 this like you're transposed from here to there i'm saying being transposed is still right because
01:00:28 you will be dead you will die yeah there will be no transposition it's a copy paste and deleting
01:00:33 the original file the the only way i've been i've been thinking about this before the only way that
01:00:37 i'm at all like comfortable with that is that what's that ship the ship of thesius or whatever
01:00:41 like that model if we can if we can like plug in my brain to the computer and slowly piece by
01:00:47 piece we move little bits of me over so that after a while i'm like halfway on halfway off
01:00:51 and then we keep doing that until now i'm all the way on the computer even then it's kind of like
01:00:56 a hazy maybe you're still dead i think you're still dead right well the problem i don't have an
01:01:01 answer i mean i think that doesn't really come into the thing like it's you know if you're you're
01:01:06 just slowly being copied that's all this whole this whole discussion it's the same as teleportation
01:01:11 like like you're killing yourself and but you know you as you understand may i remind me it's
01:01:17 gonna be around when it comes to the teleportation argument i always have to remind everyone
01:01:21 that every seven years there is no same atom in your body that was there seven years ago
01:01:28 yeah you are literally a wholly different person every seven years it's the it's the it's the
01:01:33 continuity that people value that's what's mad and that's that's why i think the ship of damocles the
01:01:38 ship of thesius whatever it is that models whatever it is that sort of makes sense that to do it that
01:01:43 way as long as there's continuity you're conscious the entire time you're slowly transposed for one
01:01:48 body to another i mean it makes no sense i'm more i'm more willing to entertain that than a
01:01:53 than a snap cons copy yeah yeah guys yeah that whole discussion is based on a really stupid axiom
01:01:58 that oh you have to delete the original that's absolutely not a thing at all there's no reason
01:02:04 why you couldn't just copy it some people it's it's a whole separate issue though like yeah like
01:02:09 am i comfortable with there just being another me i would have to think about and that's that's
01:02:12 like a separate question i think it would be really funny just like just like in a homestuck with
01:02:16 little how the debu collective would be comfortable with oh yeah you wouldn't you fucking motherfucker
01:02:23 that happens in serial experiments lane and the alternate version ruins her life so you know it
01:02:29 can be scary well that goes back to the horrors of technology i would i here's what i would do i would
01:02:36 make a copy of myself in a robot body so that i could beat it up if it you know so that it's it's
01:02:42 for convents for self-esteem like fuck you dude i'm the no no what i mean is if it tries to
01:02:47 fuck up my life it still has a physical presence and it can't run and hide in the internet like it's
01:02:53 it's just it's just on a chip and if i you just keep it on a flash drive in your pocket you'll flush
01:02:57 it down the toilet as soon as it starts acting a bitch hey if fucking if fucking your clone is
01:03:03 not gay is beating up your clone like not violent is like self-flage elation you know what are the
01:03:09 laws here dude guys if i could clone myself like my brain i would like immediately start an animation
01:03:16 studio that's just me i would love to see debu collective videos about that every day i'm just
01:03:24 like man i just thought of a funny animation i could do oh fuck there's only one of you would
01:03:28 take two wait i could i could finally get a somewhat get what someone to do textures for me and do
01:03:32 all my video editing yeah imagine they'd be miserable but i'd pay them nominally we didn't
01:03:37 really think about that but imagine like the logical extreme of that what if like one guy was
01:03:41 like okay um i'm just gonna keep making copies of myself until i can fucking run everything
01:03:46 and then he just starts like and then like 90 percent of all people are this guy now he has to
01:03:50 have all the hard drive space oh my god it's shadow clone juicier and it's fucking bad and if the
01:03:55 worst part is fucking bad oh no no one's in the entire universe is never on time
01:04:07 oh get fucked man yeah the the whole thing would like having copies of yourself like if it was
01:04:14 like physical human clones then it would be weird like who you're a human being blah blah blah
01:04:19 but if you're a robot you're let you i can program you to not care about being the main one so i
01:04:24 can be the main one yeah i know but like um you can argue that i definitely am interested
01:04:31 and this is something like rick and morty explores a lot where he always makes like a clone but
01:04:35 there's something different and it's like usually they they just like he'll say you know this clone
01:04:42 doesn't have a sense of self or like it's not basically you can abuse this thing and it is not
01:04:48 a human rights violation because it's not quite human you know or it's not quite you and i always
01:04:54 find that really fascinating i always wonder what if i would use it like would i feel too bad
01:05:00 you know because like rick's always raising that like people you know other people who he
01:05:04 uh you know shows these clones are always like horrified and he's like yeah but you know it's not
01:05:09 it's not quite human i'm just saying you know i remember uh is rick smart enough to make an
01:05:15 argument that lets him basically do whatever he wants so he can find a way to justify you know
01:05:20 killing whoever morty just accidentally killed true you know i know like bill whittle a guy who's
01:05:24 like big into futurism and space exploration like he gets invited to like space x sometimes
01:05:29 stuff like that right and like he got invited to like some showing of some new robot like
01:05:35 animal thing it just like walks around on four legs but like intelligently reads the the terrain
01:05:39 in order to get around right and the guy and one of the engineers is like yeah it's pretty cool
01:05:43 bunk he kicks it like kicks it right in the head equivalent and like the and like the robot like
01:05:47 like like trying to like catch its balance and like steadily gets back up and bill was like
01:05:52 i had to restrain myself from getting mad at the man because i i felt like he had just heard
01:05:56 right i know and it's like i love watching videos of people beat up it's fucking it's
01:06:00 boston dynamics man boston dynamics the most evil people on the planet according to some robot
01:06:05 rights you know you know it's really it's it's so fascinating though because like it's it really
01:06:10 is interesting how we prescribe like uh moral consideration like that like it just because
01:06:15 it moves in a way that we've seen i mean things that we generally give moral consideration but
01:06:20 it was just like it was just like some random robot stiffly walking around even if it looked
01:06:24 more human it's someone knocked over like haha you know there wouldn't be any of the whole thing
01:06:28 about that to animals morality like the whole thing about like morality coming into the future
01:06:32 there's exactly one sci-fi fictional work that captures it perfectly duck dodgers in the 23rd
01:06:38 and a half century we're at the very end he's standing on this one tiny little fragment of
01:06:43 planet going i win that is morality in the 23rd century that sounds cool but i like i like what
01:06:50 gib was saying there we we we the the funny thing is people don't think about but like yeah we do this
01:06:54 to animals too people treat animals like they have quote unquote souls like humans do when they in
01:06:59 fact do not they definitely don't now pretty sure god addressed this directly in the bible uh but
01:07:05 none none of the less nonetheless uh the guy you don't believe exist is back in your argument well
01:07:10 yeah it's i use it when it's convenient sorry guys what a fucking blue-pilled cock
01:07:16 dude like okay so i was i was to answer finally the question i raised a while ago like how would
01:07:20 i adopt it right yeah this whole consciousness issue just cannot be fucking solved i mean maybe
01:07:25 there'd be some post singularity consciousness that could just convince the shit out of me
01:07:29 but then i'd be confused as to whether or not maybe it's just so smart it can trick me into
01:07:33 thinking it you know who knows but so for me the solution is pretty fucking simple like like i said
01:07:38 get like a body enhancing like body uh lengthening uh you know extensions or whatever and you know
01:07:44 try to and just try and do this now in my body as long as i can and eventually things might come
01:07:49 to a head and when there's no other choice then go ahead fucking upload me you know because i'm
01:07:52 going to die anyway whatever right yeah i think that's nano machines to body lengthen my penis
01:08:00 the sad truth here is that we were all born in leirang generation when it comes to this like
01:08:05 we can't like i really really hoping that i can taste a little bit of it when i'm like 70
01:08:10 well that's i mean i think we will all at least make it far enough for some augmentation but i
01:08:16 really want this exact same podcast to be done like every 20 years by a different like like the
01:08:22 next generation of us like our kids to do this podcast and tell us because our kids are all
01:08:27 going to be raised by us a bunch of fucking uh goddamn sci-fi weeaboos who are gonna like
01:08:33 rant about the glories of technology the whole time so i want to hear their opinions or they're
01:08:37 like oh yeah of course i'd be like we're going to they're all amish just like i want to know
01:08:44 they might be uh they're like oh why would i want my physical form like my ego is if anything the
01:08:49 only weakness i have i would i would love to be a part of the cloud you know like i don't i don't
01:08:54 know if this is likely to happen but i always kind of wonder if like what if uh will we hit a plateau
01:08:58 where people are just satisfied with a level of technology it's like where all your physical
01:09:02 needs are met oh why bother like i have another like prediction based on not really at the planet
01:09:07 but a prediction i agree based on different predictions that are right and wrong because as i
01:09:12 said you know you look at back in the past like you know 1800s people are like oh we think by the
01:09:17 year 1905 everyone will have jet packs who of course they will right um and like also let me see
01:09:23 what sci-fi there was like some sci-fi book from like 1870 where some guys go to the moon via canon
01:09:29 right and this was actually talked about in a book okay it was actually talked about in a book
01:09:33 about uh it was actually the art of game design a book of lenses by jessie shill but he was talking
01:09:37 about how at the time everyone kind of assumed that would happen or like like it's just sort of
01:09:42 made sense in sort of a pulpy sort of way because cannons at the time were getting a whole lot better
01:09:48 constantly right so the so really when you look at everyone who was wrong about the level of steam
01:09:54 punk that would happen by the night by the 20th century during the 19th century is because they
01:09:59 thought the same kind of rapid innovation steam technology you know machines and products and
01:10:04 stuff they thought that was going to just keep infinitely increasing and so the same thing with
01:10:08 that the same thing with uh the 60s right right right like lost in space like the year 1997 we're
01:10:14 going to leave earth and it's just because that's the whole space race was going on and like why
01:10:18 would that stop you know what it is i like that you brought the subdivided because i do sometimes i
01:10:24 lately i've had more and more doubts about computer technology actually advancing
01:10:29 because it doesn't feel like it's been advancing faster late right yeah exactly so yeah so like
01:10:35 like what i was saying before about like the internet thing right like we're computers in general
01:10:38 during the 20th century people thought like technology was going to advance more like with
01:10:42 machines or industry or something like that people didn't really see the whole computer thing coming
01:10:48 until it was too late and so one guy pointed out that they got like infinitely more powerful every
01:10:52 10 years so i can see everyone making the same mistake again which is that oh this whole progress
01:10:57 that we're making is just going to keep happening infinitely because that's our closed minded you
01:11:01 know primate brain assumption right but it could end up being something totally different it could
01:11:05 end up being just oh 3d printers fuck off 3d printers they just do everything now or it could
01:11:09 be something a fucking fidget spinners of course let's like hashtag 2017 they end up we end up in
01:11:14 like a post-singular society yeah we look up to the sky and the fidget spinners sun is just going
01:11:21 off and generating energy for everyone and we have like fidget spinners instead of hearts you know
01:11:26 oh you know what no i'm sorry that wasn't me me enough it's just going to be emoji emoji or the
01:11:30 secret to like all of life my prediction is that computers are going to stop the aesthetic of
01:11:38 computers and metal and sci-fi is going to get oh who cares and then they're going to go back to
01:11:44 they're going to make computers look like wood and then pirates are going to come back and i'm
01:11:48 going to be a pirate by the way give just hoping for a second dark age we can all just go back
01:11:55 yes a dark a dark age just aesthetic wise it looks like that but everything else is like
01:12:00 perfect we just turn all the lights off it's a dark age how's this how's this for a millennial
01:12:06 perspective when before did you said something like how technology needs to keep advancing people
01:12:10 won't give up because we need to get off the planet i was going to really say as a real counter
01:12:14 argument yeah well that didn't work for krypton now did it you idiot and then i thought for a
01:12:20 second i was like oh wait a minute well i was thinking what my train of thought went after
01:12:24 that is really we have to escape the universe because the whole universe dies eventually so
01:12:29 guys we've only got like six trillion years left we've got to do something exactly we're on the
01:12:34 we gotta rise above our three-dimensional limits and we have to
01:12:40 no incidentally that's what that show kato is about yeah unfortunately it doesn't explore this
01:12:44 we need to yeah you're right we need to break our 3d limits you may need to vibrate higher to
01:12:48 leave this earth of 3d to one earth of 4d or 5d going to the 5d is exactly what we need to do
01:12:54 yugioh 5d's was the answer all along here we go baby tom i want to just do everything on motorcycles
01:13:01 that's the solution i was really glad that tom um that you explained what you would do the same
01:13:07 way you did four years ago on uh on a different podcast because you really like i've thought
01:13:14 when i think about transhumanism i think about it in terms of what tom said about how like
01:13:19 all your organs and stuff can just fail and like that to me is what makes it feel urgent
01:13:25 like we could talk about this is like sci-fi concepts we all want but like when i think about
01:13:30 my fucking physical form and how shit it is and like right like my brother very fine dude my brother
01:13:36 and victor had to have his pancreas removed because it almost exploded but the pain not not the pancreas
01:13:43 i meant the um the appendix his appendix had to be removed because he got appendicitis and it
01:13:48 would have blown up and what happens if your appendix explodes is that it can damage your other
01:13:53 organs and kill you well what does your appendix do literally nothing the only thing the appendix
01:14:00 is there for is to explode and kill you uh so why the fuck have we not figured out like why is that
01:14:08 not just something we can remove at birth well because it's too dangerous to operate i hear that
01:14:12 every single time that the appendix is pointless that it can't be completely pointless it's that it
01:14:18 wants to have a point but it doesn't just like your tonsils like that's why if you get if you keep
01:14:22 getting tonsillitis they just take them out because they don't actually do anything we had them in a
01:14:27 time where we're like the air of the earth was different you know we're a perpetual transitional
01:14:32 form yeah there's so much there's lots of fucking design craft in our dna and it's bullshit did you
01:14:38 did you entirely right it digested plant matter i think i could be thinking the wrong thing whatever
01:14:44 it is it we don't need it because that's why they can just take it out like if you get appendicitis
01:14:48 they just remove the thing oh yeah and you you don't miss it oh and you guys zero cases of people
01:14:54 you guys know like goose bumps that's because it's supposed to make your first stand up on it
01:14:57 to make it look bigger that's right to make it look bigger to strength predators and shit
01:15:02 indeed indeed i did not know that incidentally yeah uh well does anybody have anything else
01:15:08 to say about transhumanism or do we want to move into questions because i got a bunch of good
01:15:12 trains humanism i like i want to be oh yeah i think i think the thing to take relish in is that
01:15:19 eventually we're gonna have to iterate on all this technology really fast because when the
01:15:23 technological singularity does happen and we have machines that are smarter than humans
01:15:26 we're all gonna feel really bad about it because we have fragile egos and that's when we're gonna
01:15:30 become i remember being in digi's kitchen one time talking about like a cgp great like one of
01:15:35 his episodes of the hello internet where he was like yeah you know guys like i don't know if i'm
01:15:39 really into like like a beyond human ai at this point because like think about it like yeah we
01:15:44 think they'll have our interests in mind but like they're more intelligent to us imagine if like
01:15:48 gorillas had invented humans imagine if gorillas made humans you think that would turn out well
01:15:53 and shade walked up behind me and said that all of them sucked
01:16:06 oh fuck i wanted to keep going but i just want to end on that no there's nothing i can add it's
01:16:12 better yeah it's pretty good um the most important thing about this is just this all needs to happen
01:16:16 before i specifically die absolutely the only thing that matters well they agree let's get a
01:16:21 move on to transition into questions because the first one is super relevant that i found okay um
01:16:26 from gray nine he asks scientists announce we will be in a post scarcity society by next week
01:16:32 what plans do you make oh fuck complicated uh i mean what i do is i quit my job immediately and
01:16:40 just start doing the content i want to do all the time i i guess that would be my first because
01:16:45 like i don't know what's gonna happen once it happens so i have to worry about all that
01:16:50 shit i have a really specific answer i would uh tell all those people who are uh poised to
01:16:54 adopt some of my baby hamsters no thanks man i'm printing myself some more cages and a bigger room
01:17:01 that's adorable i i would um spend i would forget about youtube because fuck it dude that's not
01:17:09 that important i would spend all of my time writing homes uh horse stuff oh yeah i would write
01:17:15 and i would make it twice as long as homestuck because i have all the time in the world so does
01:17:18 post scarcity society mean that none of us need jobs of course i think true okay yeah honestly i
01:17:24 probably stopped when we had to focus on other projects yeah i'm immediately off the internet
01:17:28 forever first of all um all i do is make really fucking weird shit with munchie that's my oh yeah
01:17:38 yeah all right right scarcity we'd all just got we'd no money yeah just hang out one place
01:17:43 does much still need to finish school in a post scarcity world i don't know but me and munchie
01:17:48 are just gonna hang out and like headbutt things like oh you know i'll make a whole like i'll make
01:17:54 a whole thing like other i don't even want to film this for myself i don't want to post this on youtube
01:17:59 i just want me and munchie to become so known for headbutting things that people start recording
01:18:04 us and like we get funded by like sponsorships and like movie deals you know on on that front
01:18:11 not the money funding yeah right on that front i would immediately go find a place for pcb hq
01:18:17 that's immediately what i would do fucking like man made island on the pacific bitch
01:18:23 wherever's appropriate i would be in the shape of the pcb it's just so it's really hard the only
01:18:27 reason i'm not doing that now is because of money i can't think of how to imagine the world without
01:18:32 needing money like i can't like doesn't it seem like the obvious answer is i'll just go fuck all day
01:18:37 like i'll just have sex and drink and smoke oh here i think there's nothing about post
01:18:42 post scarcity society that it's always interested me is people imagine like people frame it like
01:18:46 oh it's like going to be this utopia thing where there's no need to work or anything money is just
01:18:52 a me like the only reason people even really want money is because what it facilitates it
01:18:55 facilitates power it facilitates status yeah and like your desire for power and status does not go
01:19:00 away if you don't need money because you still have to have some way to obtain those things is there
01:19:04 no i don't think society is going to change as much as we all think it will just pull scarcity
01:19:08 mean that there is no scarcity of marijuana does that well probably 3d print it you probably
01:19:14 3d print that dude no like 3d print myself weed and watch everything ever you know you that's
01:19:19 what i mean already 3d print weed it's called planting it and growing it my friend he's not
01:19:24 he's not wrong but you know that that honestly does that does bring in an interesting question
01:19:29 because though the idea of like pcp hq it is a money making operation at the end of the day and
01:19:35 as tom said like that still will be necessary but like my plans for to get everybody here together
01:19:39 to do that do hinge on the idea that you guys will be motivated to make content you know to make money
01:19:45 and maybe that would change i don't know i see it in eight is that the difference between uh
01:19:49 priest scarcity and post scarcity pcp scarcity pcp is we all meet up in one place to make
01:19:55 the best content we've ever made post scarcity is we all meet up and we exclusively make the
01:20:00 blue glow like that's all let's play like all we do is let's play 24 7 because all we want to do
01:20:07 is play video games like so what i've come to realize now now that i've started playing video
01:20:12 games again um which i've been doing for the last like couple months i've been playing lots of games
01:20:17 and i realized that i have no real desire to do anything but play video games and listen to the
01:20:22 dick show because i feel totally opposed to that exactly we gotta we gotta no go ahead nate
01:20:31 oh okay but i was just gonna say i i know where you're coming from but but here's the thing
01:20:35 uh for most of my life i did exactly that i watched anime and played video games it's
01:20:41 it's only recently that i have felt the best about myself in my life that i ever have because
01:20:46 i'm finally accomplishing something but that's because made my life in a society where those
01:20:50 things are not helpful to do well but but that's no matter what we do humans are social animals and
01:20:57 we we want to have like i'm not i'm not afraid to say it like now that i have a little bit of
01:21:02 like power in society like i have an audience that respects me to some degree and people like what i
01:21:07 do and i have something to offer that allows me to have a little bit of influence it's it's those
01:21:11 factors that appeal to me inherently as a human male probably women too but for me for me personally
01:21:18 like a hundred percent of all the problems in my life are tied to my influence and talking to
01:21:23 other people so maybe that's why i'm going to the other regrets and perhaps i agree with either of
01:21:28 you my motivation for doing things is entirely because i feel like i have an obligation as a human
01:21:33 being to to to use my skills and my talents in the best way that i can the the only reason i want
01:21:38 an audience is because i need money and that's the best way to get it for doing the work that i
01:21:42 want to do and the only reason i bother doing like fucking gay youtube shit that can easily
01:21:46 generate money is because i need that money if i didn't need money i would do nothing that would
01:21:50 get me in that i would not focus on building an audience because i don't care about that i wouldn't
01:21:54 focus on money because it wouldn't exist i'm curious though i'm curious though doesn't your
01:21:57 top doesn't your work only have meaning because it has an audience yeah that's what i was gonna
01:22:00 bring up but for me i don't i don't think so at all well for me at least when i was younger
01:22:04 for the lirth for the first like ten years for the first ten years that i made things i had no
01:22:09 audience at all and i was right upset that i didn't but it didn't stop me from making it i wanted to
01:22:14 not because i want i mean of course you want an audience to see it but even if you had told me
01:22:19 tell me right now that like your project will never have an audience because i'm already working
01:22:24 under that assumption that's why i put so much effort now and trying to be more active on the
01:22:27 pcps i'm assuming this is how i'm going to make money and the content i actually want to do is
01:22:32 never going to get the level of success that would need to be my job but that doesn't i have no
01:22:36 intention of stopping to do it because that's like the only thing i feel that like gives my life
01:22:39 actual meaning about yeah for me it's i hear what you're saying it's just that specifically the
01:22:43 you're talking about consuming art though and like the the the use that art has in the world
01:22:48 is that people see it and then like enjoy it and stuff right so like isn't that just an inherent
01:22:52 part of the thing that i've been trying to talk about this whole time is is is that in the post
01:22:57 scarcity society people won't need huge audiences but they can all yeah like you know anything i want
01:23:04 to make right is for a few people i'm not yeah i want i want to make the horse stuck thing yeah
01:23:10 to impress anyone who likes home stuck and myself and close friends and if it's an audience of a
01:23:14 maximum of 20 people it wouldn't matter to me because that's all i was making it for i was
01:23:19 making for me and a few other people i agree with that it's like i don't be for everyone i'm not
01:23:23 saying i don't want an audience and i wouldn't like it i'm just saying it's complete the work
01:23:27 that i want to do i want to do because i want to see it exist you know it's you know it's interesting
01:23:31 that's why i want to go to to pcphq by the way is is is to hang out with you and the content made
01:23:37 like in let's play form can entertain a few people but the the the reason i would move is so that i
01:23:43 could hang out with you and it'll be like fun and i totally agree but this this is very interesting
01:23:48 to me this strikes me as a fundamental difference in what we're like what what our goals are because
01:23:52 my goal is specifically to communicate like my ideas to people and have them receive them which
01:23:57 is why like my my really primary goal is to is to package them in a way that both i enjoy
01:24:02 but that people will be receptive to so that they'll hear what i'm saying and like i think i'm right
01:24:06 so i want them to hear me and be swayed by my opinion so like that that's what i'm aiming for
01:24:10 the vehicle to get there is is open to me i think the difference between is because you're trying to
01:24:15 you're you're more worried you're trying to communicate your ideas like your videos have a
01:24:19 point like this is my opinion on something right right in order to make the the art i guess of that
01:24:24 you it needs to affect as many people as possible where like my like passion project is like telling
01:24:28 a story and like i don't need to prove it to anybody i just wanted to exist so i think because
01:24:33 the goals of those projects are different i totally get both of you because i there's like
01:24:38 when i make a video like here's this thing about anime that everybody's getting wrong like the only
01:24:44 real value in that is correcting other people's minds when i make like my music i don't give a
01:24:50 single fuck who listens to it like i if i have like one person buying it that's fine i just want
01:24:57 it to exist for my own sake because it's something that i needed to be off of my chest you know and
01:25:02 i think i would go much more down that road um if i had you know if i didn't have to worry about
01:25:07 yeah i guess okay like i guess i hear what you're saying specific plans if post guarantees announced
01:25:12 i would tell degi hey uh you know if you want to fucking have me edit any videos go ahead but no
01:25:18 schedule i'm not gonna write anything right i'm not gonna write a single video ever again if i
01:25:27 don't need money well i'll guess i'll just go watch anime occasionally and then also i think i'd
01:25:31 still i think i just spent all my time just making a game except uh it would have all the things i
01:25:36 wanted to be in a game rather than some of the things heavily censored that i'm planning on
01:25:41 putting it in my game well get what were you saying gib i was gonna say like in in this society
01:25:48 where it would be like all the artists are suddenly making what they want and all of the people on
01:25:54 youtube who are doing clickbait will die because they don't care about it oh yeah finally the art
01:26:00 landscape would change overnight you know what's fascinating i just watched like rice gums uh like
01:26:05 reaction to the to the roast of him or whatever and he was talking about like how this is what he
01:26:09 lives for he lives for drama like as a result of you know the content cop that just came out and
01:26:13 i was just like what kind of life do you live where you like this is your purpose in life to
01:26:17 respond to people talking whatever it doesn't matter i'm sorry go on gib the nothing else done
01:26:22 let me get our next question which uh dovetails pretty nicely out of that one uh vampire wait hang
01:26:27 on did you are these coming from the patron lounge yes these are coming how could you possibly
01:26:31 access such a place i need to know we're paying us for our amazing content then you would be able
01:26:38 to contribute questions to the show because uh you know uh fuck you otherwise um
01:26:46 what a great pitch vampire patreon slash best oh i was going to contribute to our personal
01:26:51 post scarcity society and give us your money yeah patreon.com slash the procrastiners okay there you
01:26:55 go which literally literally everything we just said about post scarcity will also become true of
01:27:00 our personal careers if the pcp made enough money to just be our day job it's very true very true um
01:27:08 vampire giffy asks a two-part question what is your best project that never saw the light of day
01:27:14 and what is the worst thing you've made that has seen the light of day
01:27:18 nate you could start us off if you uh if you want oh man i mean the the the first part things that
01:27:24 have not seen the light of day extensive work i mean i have not made anything that is good that
01:27:30 i have not released i was actually just talking to you guys the other day about how like i have
01:27:33 never completed a video and then not released it ever i i mean i don't spend time on things it doesn't
01:27:38 have to be completed let's just say like the best project idea that fell through you know
01:27:43 fell through i mean there's there's always a like that you've abandoned yeah like if there's a project
01:27:48 that you were working on that you feel like would have been amazing but it has not been completed
01:27:54 and i mean i'm well known to have taken a very long time to actually release my best anime ever
01:27:59 ghost in the shell which i but it will eventually but it will but there are several other projects
01:28:04 that i have not announced of that same ilk that like i know things about them and have produced
01:28:09 pieces of them already but they are there are ways out uh but in terms of things that got
01:28:13 dropped i mean there's always what me and ben talked about of the raise these bros which i actually did
01:28:18 make a song for uh for like it was going to be like the finale of t-bap or something uh but we
01:28:23 never that's what that was never got around to it yeah yeah that song floats around in my hard drive
01:28:27 somewhere all right oh and but uh in terms of things that are bad that i did release i mean
01:28:35 i think i generally make good stuff ben and i did a ice bucket challenge on t-bap a while ago
01:28:40 yeah that wasn't great that wasn't great though it did have a cool storyline where my glasses broke
01:28:44 or rather keg standard not me his glasses broke and uh that was very sad i don't know it's all
01:28:50 great everything i've ever made is fantastic i can answer it pretty quickly i mean maybe these
01:28:54 projects i mean i've had one idea for a song parody that would require like like a slideshow
01:28:59 animation in order to make sense and i've had it as an idea for like four years i've never told
01:29:03 anyone on the internet about it because i might still do it whatever i mean really the biggest
01:29:07 thing that i seem to systemically be unable to motivate myself to finish is like a big analysis
01:29:12 of the mario and luigi series because it's just overwhelming because when i really start to think
01:29:16 about it critically i honestly think there is enough there that's all original points that are
01:29:22 not redundant off of existing analysis videos of any game at all it's like it's like it's honestly
01:29:27 as dense with like things to talk about as like the star wars prequels so i mean not quite as like
01:29:33 culturally relevant of course not by a long shot but like it would just be a huge fucking project
01:29:38 that i could honestly spend a whole year on so i end up tensing up and just not caring enough right
01:29:42 if something reminds me about the current mario and luigi games that makes me upset it only lasts
01:29:47 until the afternoon and i just wasted like some hours typing up some shit on google drive or even
01:29:52 recording something so that's stupid talk about like the worst thing i've made i mean if you're
01:29:56 gonna be technical there's like a shitload of just boring tweets so just biggest failure in my eyes
01:30:02 was when i did a video on big hero six and like just has so many great analysis things to say but
01:30:08 i like that video yeah but i pushed it through so many stupid like misguided writing techniques
01:30:13 that it's like you really can't appreciate how much analysis is in it like when i was writing it up
01:30:19 until even when i released it was like months later when i went back to it and was like oh right
01:30:23 the audience hasn't all you say that's the would you say that's the worst thing you've put out or
01:30:28 just no one that is the most discordant from what it was yeah yeah yeah not all the worst thing of
01:30:34 course because like worst thing is a stupid thing to talk about when you're when you're an internet
01:30:37 content creator my right fellas but no that's the one where it's like i wrote it based on the idea
01:30:42 that you had just seen the movie twice and also taking notes like i was it's a stupid lack of empathy
01:30:47 with the audience like completely fucked up on and when i watch it back i'm like there's no way you
01:30:50 can actually appreciate my points oh and also i still was not even decent at audio narration too
01:30:56 so it's just hard to even listen to so when i think about it yeah the distance between how i
01:31:01 thought about it at the time versus now it's that one okay tom do you have an answer for this
01:31:07 i think the best idea that i've dropped and hopefully someday i'll come back to it when
01:31:11 i have the the skill to properly realize it because i think it's probably the greatest
01:31:14 idea i've ever had is uh it started out as a as a just a narrative story but i realized that the
01:31:21 point i was trying to tell would be way better as a game um i don't want to get too much into it
01:31:25 because like even to talk about the idea would spoil it and i do still want to make it someday
01:31:29 but it's a game that would have a dynamic art style and the as the art style changes throughout
01:31:33 the game it also reinforces the thematic points going on in it that's fucking cool damn um
01:31:38 it's got likes but that's cool it's it's oh god it's if i can that's the one number one reason
01:31:44 i want transhumanism probably need like another 70 years to get good enough to make this game
01:31:47 properly so get on it people um and the worst thing that i've ever released is everything
01:31:54 that was on my very first youtube channel that mercifully i deleted so no one can ever find it
01:31:59 thank god hippo um uh yeah i've i've got a thing uh the best thing that i never got around to
01:32:10 was an idea i had while listening to pink floyd and it was to animate the entirety of pink floyd's
01:32:16 the wall but replacing the characters uh in the songs with my little pony
01:32:23 i would i would imagine that's the best idea that never saw who is who is have a cigar about
01:32:32 who's the have a cigar that's not in the wall oh i fucked up it's the wrong oh god damn okay never
01:32:38 mind i also had an idea for animating uh the division bell uh to be about uh dick masterson
01:32:45 and and matters and that that whole thing not bad because a lot of those songs are like oh it
01:32:50 you can just imagine them talking to each other singing to each other like this
01:32:55 it's great but uh you know never ever gonna have the time to animate something like that
01:33:00 and also copyright would not let me monetize it afterwards so nope um but the the worst thing
01:33:06 i did publish was uh i don't know some why it's okay to clop you degenerate pony fucker
01:33:18 i've been on to you that's an okay no i actually like that video a lot i'm just mimin you i i i've
01:33:23 made like a couple like eh whatever sort of vlogs i guess i don't know i don't pay attention to the
01:33:29 my failures it's a bad idea i as a contact yeah you're going um i have no idea how to answer this
01:33:37 because i have so many answers for both like i have like gallons of unreleased content like
01:33:47 and and the thing is that these days i've sort of been going back through a lot of it and just
01:33:51 like releasing the concepts and shit like you know my my novel i wrote back in 2010 like for six years
01:33:58 that would have probably been the best thing that never saw the light of day but now i've gone ahead
01:34:02 and just released it unfinished under the internet um tons and tons of great story concepts my personal
01:34:09 favorite has always been um maho shoujo to henshin papa which is the the the magical girl and
01:34:16 transforming dad where separately a daughter and father the daughter becomes a magical girl and the
01:34:21 dad becomes a transforming hero and they don't they're not even aware of it but then eventually
01:34:25 they have to work together um but like i i just have like a thousand ideas i have tons of analysis
01:34:31 videos that have never been made album ideas songs that i have fully written in my head but
01:34:37 because i cannot perform instruments there is no way to translate them to um to the internet except
01:34:43 in acapella versions that i've released just as like proof of concept of their existence um
01:34:49 actually interesting you mentioned that digi i remember watching the diaries like the the
01:34:53 production diaries for uh that m dot strange guy he had for uh his third film and he showed this
01:35:00 production of like you can get a vst that um you hum and it takes that and applies it to any
01:35:06 instrument made the entire soundtrack oh my god i i need that badly fascinating that is the coolest
01:35:13 shit i've ever heard of yeah and if i can find it i will use it immediately that's always in the
01:35:17 back of my head of like if i ever start getting into animation for real and i need to do music
01:35:21 that's that's the way i'm gonna do it yeah and as for the worst thing i've made that's seen the
01:35:26 light of day this is equally difficult to answer because i've been on the internet since 2001
01:35:33 and like i've never deleted anything like there's some stuff that's set to private but it saw the
01:35:38 light of day at some point um what comes to mind first is the otaku sex hotline what what what i've
01:35:45 never heard of this i told i told this story in detail on a recent digi in may i think no on a
01:35:52 pub crawl a recent pub crawl i told this story but uh but to summarize i had a tumblr that was
01:35:59 supposed to be for people to like tell us about their like weird otaku-based sex hangups and we
01:36:05 would like give advice except the real reason it existed was so that i eventually could just post
01:36:11 my weird sex hangups and answer it myself and after after that happened which was probably
01:36:19 like the seventh post on the blog it completely died like no one everyone was just in abject
01:36:25 horror of what i had done what of anything you've released on the internet are you the most
01:36:31 ashamed of to think about right now if you want to divulge that well that was what came to mind
01:36:36 first oh yeah that's a good sign that or like just tons of writing about like otaku sexuality i did
01:36:44 that doesn't hold up uh back back in the 2010 or so um lots of youtube videos that are just
01:36:53 cringe worthy some of them are entertaining though like there's one digi bro digi digital boy cracks
01:36:59 open the double down where i just review the double down from kfc but i'm like so awkward and creepy
01:37:06 looking that it's like watching him like a murderer rapist eat a double down um there's just a lot
01:37:12 like there's tons and tons of content i've made because i've been on the internet for so fucking
01:37:16 long and most of it's most of it's cringe worthy i remember the time you pretended to be a pony and
01:37:22 you were running around that i'm very proud of that's awesome um i've rewatched that recently
01:37:30 because of victor being in that and just like that's what made it great poor poor guy i don't know
01:37:34 what the worst thing i've made like since becoming a popular youtuber is like there's a couple videos
01:37:40 i've made that i wasn't proud of like uh sort of infamously i had just hidden my um zanko notera
01:37:46 video because i thought it was so badly written um like there's been a few but not most of the
01:37:53 stuff i make has some entertainment value to it like even if it's not amazing there's something
01:37:57 good about it but if you go back through my history it's just a non-stop wave of infinite cringe so
01:38:03 yeah there's lots to choose from so my answer for both is everything i've ever made let's let's move
01:38:10 on to the next question um what loot will you drop when you die oh that's a good one wait who
01:38:15 who said who said that that's from dry bones god damn i oh i would definitely be a pile of sunglasses
01:38:22 a pile of sunglasses yes for sure for sure i'd drop like two mountain dews um a a pack of cigarettes
01:38:36 and uh and also sunglasses but of a different sort yes indeed i would drop uh basically economics
01:38:43 by tomas soul which you can't remove and you can't remove it from your inventory it's like
01:38:47 stuck in your inventory and it like takes up one weight and you're so pissed off at it forever
01:38:55 just like how it weighs on your mind that that forbidden knowledge every day to do
01:38:58 a yes i understand get what do you got i can't top that i can't fucking think of anything
01:39:06 you you'd uh it's just a hippo plush guitar uh yeah hippo plush that's that's or guitar strings
01:39:12 yeah that'd be good maybe a poof of hair that was good hey if we have any that's all the same
01:39:20 that's called cutting my hair or if we have that's your escape tactics you're like a wobba
01:39:25 we're gonna do any more just your hair we're gonna do any more questions you cut my whole body up
01:39:31 that was the true form doing any more questions i gotta go so i i guess i'll just leave now unless
01:39:36 we're done uh you can go ahead a little bit longer cool so i'm gonna i'm just gonna post in the
01:39:41 discord my answers to things by listening on my phone and if someone wants to read it out they can
01:39:45 yeah other than that i'll see you all right all right uh tom tom and you um i think mine would
01:39:53 probably be an unidentified stylist and when you go to identify it you find out it's cursed and now
01:39:58 you have good you have talent but infinite depression ah god damn i love the thoroughness
01:40:05 of that answer it's perfect oh man god damn bed would definitely be like a stylist in a vape for
01:40:12 sure for sure just the vape let's be real yeah you're right you're right it'd be a vape stylist
01:40:17 like two in one yes the ultimate combo i uh this one this one might be difficult but i thought it
01:40:23 was interesting because it's so precise duck chutney asks favorite character design oh jeez
01:40:30 full stop favorite character shadow the hedgehog yeah killer kills pretty good anime um i uh i
01:40:40 actually like ryuko is at near the top of my list for sure that's what i said ryuko doesn't very
01:40:46 ryuko in her um like her normal outfit is like extremely i like it a lot it's very good i also
01:40:51 like her transform because she does look like shadow it's pretty great um i don't know it's
01:40:55 going to sound lazy but i love everything about how kami looks you know i'm not really a big tattoo
01:40:59 guy he's yeah he's fantastic and the color design across the series unbelievable but uh i've never
01:41:04 been a big tattoo guy but just like this is not limited to anime by the way like it's any character
01:41:09 design that you right that's just where my mind goes i'm gonna come back with another answer
01:41:13 somebody else go uh oh i have a good one uh mind fang from homestuck i forget who that is
01:41:20 it's it's risco's ancestor the cool pirate's right queen apparently she's got that cool sword and
01:41:26 the in the coat yeah apparently i really like wants to shout out power puff girls z the anime
01:41:32 version power puff girls um what oh yeah those things were pretty cool i'm gonna have to give
01:41:38 my answer as the one character design that i've by far spent the most time obsessing
01:41:43 with which is remilia scarlet from toho of course yeah because i she's got everything immortal
01:41:50 lollies pink uh she's vampire i'm i'm into all those things and like just the way that even more
01:41:58 so than the character design herself the way that um artists will always draw her in like a very red
01:42:04 world like like like when you look at art of remilia the whole background is always different
01:42:10 shades of scarlet like and it's funny because it's her actual character design doesn't really
01:42:14 have much red on it but like it's just kind of interpreted as fitting into that world i guess
01:42:19 and uh i like yeah yeah um here's a grab bag just a couple uh i i love uh uh griffith i love uh the
01:42:28 way yeah griffith is dope um i just i i know it's expected but nia i just like nia's character
01:42:33 design is like so creative and awesome it's like unbelievable and uh and then finally uh her her
01:42:39 fucking hair like it's it's never been done before no one's ever had nia's hair and it's like the
01:42:44 best looking hair ever especially short nia is i yeah i love short hair nia with her with her pink
01:42:49 ass hoodie god she looks fantastic and finally uh ramza lugria in his second and third armor forms
01:42:55 not his basic bitch order of the north sky one that's for pussies there you go that's all right the
01:43:00 gobs asks what is your biggest pet peeve with amateur content creators um it's it's proceeding
01:43:08 proceeding a video it's it's proceeding a video with talking about how they haven't made a video
01:43:14 oh my god yeah dude fuck yeah or just like all the preamble the endless preamble up to the
01:43:21 fucking pretty much my thing is having to explain why you're making it having to like like just cut
01:43:29 just give us the content we don't need like the background of how you came about to doing it
01:43:36 you know because it's always the same story it's not like you did not have some unique epiphany
01:43:42 you just thought like it's almost always at first i didn't think the show would have much to talk about
01:43:46 but turns out it did and it's like yeah otherwise you wouldn't have made a video you know what honestly
01:43:54 i love those because now i just laugh when i see them i laugh the whole time like the the worst part
01:43:59 about those is that there's sometimes there's videos that i know are supposed to have an
01:44:04 interesting point and it bothers me so much i can't watch the video like i've had my cardinal sin i
01:44:10 still do that to this day i think i've recorded something today that has that in it you know what
01:44:15 it's not even a joke you know people have like and there's ways to do it fine like if you have a lot
01:44:19 of charisma or if you've worded well enough like it can be okay but like especially if someone's
01:44:23 stumbling through that it's just like dude fucking you had this in the editing bay you had time to
01:44:29 look at this and conclude it was not interesting you know the thing the thing i would suggest people
01:44:36 look at as like an example of how to do it good is because you know everyone likes to have an intro
01:44:42 or some sort of logo but if you watch tom scott's videos he starts his videos um just talking immediately
01:44:49 immediately about the point and he's usually on camera and always wears a red shirt his brand
01:44:54 is his face on the red shirt he doesn't need an intro he doesn't need a logo he just talks about
01:44:58 cool shit and everyone loves him he's a good boy so do that i agree um i and he's the only
01:45:05 fucking like like content every week youtuber i can name who does not stretch their videos at all
01:45:12 like they're always exactly he'll he'll fly to fucking alaska and only make a three minute video
01:45:16 out of it you know right okay yeah i remember that guy yeah he's he's good um i was gonna say i uh i
01:45:23 always am this isn't like a major criticism but people with just like very bad audio quality
01:45:29 that's just like a click off it's not like i hate them i'm just like okay i'm just not gonna watch
01:45:33 well you can't listen to it it hurts i haven't seen a video with bad audio quality you know
01:45:38 long time i i have but it's from it's not just the like clarity of the audio it's if you have
01:45:44 fucking noise in the background it's the fan noise if you got that if the noise is almost as loud
01:45:49 as your voice then it's like i literally can't listen to that you know but i just never i haven't
01:45:54 seen a video like that just like was trying i have some in mind but i don't want to shout them out
01:45:59 because i don't want to be mean um but there was uh like just like my hero trump instead of answering
01:46:05 this question i'm also going to answer the question that i wish i was asked and uh it's it's actually
01:46:09 it's the opposite of this it's what's what's something that annoys me about like too good
01:46:14 too pro animators and i will shout this guy out i don't hate this guy at all but like hold
01:46:19 in anime reviews i don't hate this man but what is what is baffling about his videos is the unbelievable
01:46:26 over editing and it's not like it is distracting visually how he will just say he'll talk for
01:46:31 like three minutes and animate every single word individually it's like i have to stop watching
01:46:37 because i'm like i cannot believe we invested the amount of time to go do this i've never made it
01:46:42 through that section of one of his videos before neither have i it's a brick fucking wall and i
01:46:46 don't hate the guy at all it's just like that just just like wow what what is this all right this one
01:46:50 i have no hate for you um gypsy ask oh and uh davoo's answer to that was complacency um gypsy
01:46:58 asks what's the worst recommendation you've ever given a friend um
01:47:06 my love fly across the country to come live with me i'll totally make vlogs you know davoo might
01:47:12 talk shit about that but but he grew he grew he that was a good experience for him to have i just
01:47:16 thought that'd be a really funny answer unfortunately he's not he's not in the call he's i hope he's
01:47:21 laughing his ass if he's listening still well it's edit in some laughs after this yeah uh
01:47:28 shit i i only give great advice i don't know well it's a recommendation so it could just be
01:47:34 like a show you told somebody to watch and they absolutely hated it i mean i've given a few
01:47:39 bad recommendations like that before hmm just where i didn't didn't i don't often i'm stumped by
01:47:45 this i don't often recommend things to people unless i know that that is their sort of thing
01:47:50 yeah but maybe as a so i guess i haven't really well as a kid i don't give a shit about stuff
01:47:58 yeah i'm like i'm really thinking back and i have pretty much stopped giving a shit what
01:48:02 other people do just in all aspects of life as long as it's not causing me a problem i'm just
01:48:06 too busy to worry about anyone or like you go figure out your life on your own go watch whatever
01:48:10 you want it's funny hearing you guys say this stuff because like i'm someone who is constantly
01:48:14 recommending things to everyone always like not just shows but like all i do is like try to
01:48:21 counsel other people on how to run their lives and i don't know why it's a compulsion of mine i
01:48:26 think it's based on my name because my name conrad it means honest counselor and i've known that
01:48:32 since i was a little kid and like tried to live up to it sounds like a calm to me so so like all
01:48:37 i do is try to like counsel people on how to run their lives and usually i give good advice most
01:48:43 people tell me i generally give good advice but sometimes i've given advice that has not led people
01:48:50 to a happier life sure i mean i'm thinking like my channel consists of a lot of recommendations
01:48:55 these days like recommending that uh takagi san anime it just that just comes to mind but that
01:49:00 that's great and everyone should read it i don't know yeah i mean when it comes to like youtube
01:49:04 stuff i recommend things that i like and i explain why i like them but i don't know how i can tell
01:49:09 whether somebody was like misinformed unless they tell me like i don't feel like people were
01:49:14 misinformed and they they actually didn't like it yeah based on what i said in my video by the way
01:49:19 this is the worst recommendation you've ever given a friend not just random strangers uh yeah well
01:49:24 yeah i mean i don't know i guess i could i i i know this is ridiculous for me to bring up but like
01:49:29 i tried because i love it so much i tried to get my friends to watch gurren log in with me in in
01:49:33 college and like god they were just not into it they just did not give you never like tried to like a
01:49:38 wingman for somebody and then the girl turned out to be shit like told someone to pursue
01:49:43 a relationship or like a lifestyle choice that just didn't work out for the ones who always
01:49:48 fucked up in those choices in those situations we're the friends though like they didn't just
01:49:51 go hard enough on whatever it was that i was demanding that they do tom you know like they
01:49:56 fucked it up or do if you're still don't talk to people in real life so this never happens
01:50:01 oh jesus our knees are also an aspect of me like i'm i'm never really the one giving recommendations
01:50:06 because i'm not the one talking to people i felt like when i asked that question if anybody had one
01:50:11 that would come to mind immediately like like that's the kind i think that guy was hoping for a real
01:50:16 juicy story but uh i think you're all anti social fucking peasants that just lock ourselves in our
01:50:23 rooms and make youtube videos so indeed let me throw out this question from the from the twitter here
01:50:28 from uh at this dorky guy oh great name dude uh yeah it's uh guys have any opinions on game length
01:50:36 does anyone feel like you're owed when you buy a 60 dollar game where this fashion comes from
01:50:40 this is twitter that's just twitter okay does anyone feel like they're owed a certain amount of
01:50:43 time when they buy a game of a certain price i hope the game is as short as possible even when
01:50:47 you pay like 60 bucks for i won't pay 60 dollars for a video game like oh that's just being idiot
01:50:53 just like monkey island told us not to way back in the day i live by that every day
01:50:58 no talking about i i don't like paying money so when a game is more than 20 bucks 20 pounds
01:51:06 i'm not i'm sort of like i really really need to i have me i need a reason to play this i'll you
01:51:12 know yeah i did yeah it's too much too much um 60 dollars never doesn't matter if it's like a million
01:51:21 hours of the exactly my favorite game ever i don't i don't want to spend that money so
01:51:27 how much was i think i got dark souls on sale i think that's the thing when it's on sale um i don't
01:51:34 i don't know i'm not thinking of i can't really think of the money and the length because dark
01:51:38 souls i've played over and over and over and over again so it has a lot of length in it kind of
01:51:43 and there's lots of different ways to go about playing the game so i guess what i what does game
01:51:50 length mean the amount of time it takes to get a hundred percent it's basically asking do you think
01:51:54 that a game has to be long in order for it to justify how much you paid for it
01:52:01 i i think i think um i mean it depends on the length obviously but i think
01:52:09 a game feels more cool when you it takes you know more than an hour more than a couple hours more
01:52:17 than a day i i on the other hand if it takes me more than two days then i don't care enough to
01:52:23 finish it like it's never gonna happen i think it definitely depends on the game and the mechanics
01:52:28 like i think every game has a set of mechanics and i think they all have a certain amount of shelf
01:52:31 life so yeah i think it totally depends on the game like i'm really just trying to think of of
01:52:36 like really short games because i generally don't like the idea of really short games it just feels
01:52:41 wrong yeah like i feel like they're for something that i'm done with if it's a game i want to play
01:52:45 over and over again like down well short for you two can like i mean it depends on the price
01:52:50 and probably like the platform and shit but it's not unreasonable to expect a certain amount of
01:52:55 game length from a game it's just a question of what that length is i will say metal gear solid
01:53:00 ground zeroes definitely did not feel like enough meat for what i paid for it that well it's that's
01:53:05 funny because like that game really is incredibly complex and has a lot of tons of details like in
01:53:10 this one level it is one level game and it takes like an hour to beat but then you can replay like
01:53:15 collect shit so like that's an interesting question is it worth 60 definitely not which is
01:53:20 why they almost immediately reduced the price because they were ashamed of themselves but yeah
01:53:25 i think i did buy it for 60 by the way it was only 40 when it came out in defense oh really
01:53:30 but it was not worth 40 bucks devu says he wants rpgs to become smaller and shorter and more about
01:53:34 the details of a world than the scale of it he also insists that he's got a lot of length in him
01:53:40 oh does that mean you have a big cock in you right now is that what you're trying to say to me
01:53:44 yo that's gay dude that's gay i i for one like i can remember i can't unfortunately i can remember
01:53:52 the last time i played paid 60 dollars for a game what i cannot remember is the last time
01:53:57 that i paid 60 for a game and then played it before it was dramatically reduced in price so
01:54:04 in other words i see no reason for me to ever buy a game at full price because there's no
01:54:08 fucking chance i'm gonna play it before it goes down that sounds like a personal problem i feel i
01:54:14 feel so like confused about i mean it's not like don't understand the question it's just hard to
01:54:19 think about price and enjoyability of a game based on the length at the same time you know i uh uh
01:54:25 like we could do a whole podcast on this i agree but the guy's question was specifically uh like
01:54:30 guys have any opinions on game length and i do have an opinion on it which isn't like a real
01:54:35 criticism but it's that so this is another great great chance for me to shout out my favorite game
01:54:39 of the year holo night which is a 10 out of 10 experience which with free dlc coming out on
01:54:44 halloween after the first free dlc thing and the amazing thing about that game is it is 15
01:54:49 fucking dollars and it's on steam it's going to be on switch at some point soon i'm just
01:54:52 shouting all this because everyone should play holo night it's fucking incredible i do plan
01:54:55 to playing it very soon excellent uh and like that game is it's a big metroidvania and it's got
01:55:01 lots of content just like if you want to beat it through the first time but it's got it's got
01:55:05 that classic thing i love about old uh metroidvania like uh egovania is what i was looking for where
01:55:11 it's got like true ending shit and all these secrets you can find that like add to the to the
01:55:16 gameplay styles you can do and the riches of the world like it's got so much content packed in it
01:55:21 for a $15 price tag that i think you can make some sort of relatively objective standard for like
01:55:27 amount of content available and quality of content versus price of the game based on that
01:55:33 i definitely think that judgment can be made um like i i totally understand people saying like
01:55:38 i'm not going to pay $60 for a five hour game um but for me it's like i won't do either one like i
01:55:45 will not pay $60 for a game period like i don't care if it has 10 000 hours in it because i won't
01:55:50 play a game that's more than 15 hours long like or 20 hours or so like um like devu says in the
01:55:57 comments uh a story based game i want the length to reflect the narrative mechanic centric game if
01:56:02 i can't get at least 50 hours of fun from it i feel i've wasted not only my money but also my time
01:56:07 there you go it's it's a mechanic centric game which is the only kind of game i play um i don't
01:56:12 want it to last more than two days i want to explore the mechanic and then go cool i get it like i
01:56:17 just played uh odin sphere um right which is five different narrative tracks and um you play as a
01:56:25 different character in each of the five but you play through the same levels and i beat the first
01:56:30 character's narrative in about eight hours and i felt satisfied and when i got to the second
01:56:35 character and realized i had to play through the same levels i went oh well i beat the game like
01:56:39 yeah right it's over i did it cool i only paid 30 for this because i waited years before buying it
01:56:45 or however long it took before uh the price went down on this game right so you know i felt like
01:56:51 uh i got what i wanted which was a video game to play for a couple days while listening to podcasts
01:56:57 you know i love what devu's say i love how devu's framing this though because like yeah like people
01:57:02 sometimes are annoyed at like rpg's being so long but that's just because you really are getting
01:57:06 such a a large amount of specifically story being being and it's it's framed as such so uh well i mean
01:57:13 a lot of the time it's that there's a lot of game between the story but parts that sort of padded
01:57:20 out like in a bad in a bad rpg i mean you can beat a final passing seven in like 30 hours if you
01:57:26 really hustle you can do that that's still a long time yeah i think that's all good that's why i never
01:57:31 beat rpg's is because at some point there's usually a point around the middle of an rpg where it
01:57:36 becomes more about the combat than the story um because essentially rpg games are too big for
01:57:44 their stories most of the time we're like at some point it gets into the third act and we're like
01:57:49 okay we know who the villain is we have to kind of get there and like that's when it gets a bit
01:57:55 more repetitive the battles get longer there starts being more and more fighting that's where
01:57:59 and that's where i'm like i don't care anymore at the end you've mastered the combat and you
01:58:03 now are getting an excuse to use your mastery you've you you have to use it on a thousand enemies
01:58:09 though i hear what you're saying i hear what you're saying it's not the amount of the combat that's
01:58:13 the problem it's when the combat system isn't as fun as the amount of combat okay that's sure
01:58:19 and something like super mario rpg where it's like timing based each battle can be really like skill
01:58:24 based you can you can try hard and you can win and you can dodge all the damage and stuff but like
01:58:30 in a in a generic bare bones like uh everyone's like a gay elf and the wizards and they go and
01:58:38 we're anime characters uh and the combat is the worst thing of all time and it's the same length
01:58:44 i hate it okay that's fair okay even if the story is one last question uh before we fucking head
01:58:51 out of here canith craley asks what type of content does youtube need more of um my answer to that is
01:59:00 irreverent shit like what i want less of is like cultural commentating analysis
01:59:06 reviews like or people just like responding to each other i want more stuff that's just
01:59:12 creative and weird and funny and like that i won't get anywhere else you know we need uh more
01:59:20 maximus thorns more maximus thorns a good example potion seller the guy who did that like uh or gmc
01:59:27 foe show like stuff like that where it's just like you know the youtube channel has an identity
01:59:32 it's one type of content but it's like something that is wholly unique to themselves and it's not
01:59:38 beholden to trying to be popular on youtube it just is a good idea you know well you know in
01:59:43 response to this specific question the answer might be uh nothing and youtube needs to die because
01:59:47 it's getting too corporate and is not supportive of this kind of content uh i just think i'm thinking
01:59:52 video content and yeah if you ask me what's the ideal situation we all end up skating from youtube
01:59:57 and everyone becomes way weirder because the we're not trying to pursue algorithmic success anymore
02:00:03 you know one of my favorite things about youtube is how you could like up to now you've been able
02:00:07 to just say the word fuck and it didn't matter you could see it at any time in any video one of the
02:00:10 greatest things about the entire fucking platform yep yep yep and now it is gone is gone yeah hashtag
02:00:18 demonetized uh tom hippo you guys got hashtag explode i kind of agree with you digi i think
02:00:24 there just needs to be more stuff on youtube and in the web in general that's less about trying to
02:00:29 game the system to make money and to just make cool shit i think we had that for a while i think
02:00:35 early youtube was all about that because there was no financial incentive in the mix at all
02:00:39 you know and i remember that that's how i found m dot strange and all this and i think this stuff's
02:00:43 fucking fantastic and it wasn't about make money it was just like cool crazy shit we need more just
02:00:48 yeah just like esoteric bizarre out there just like i want to make this as i wanted to exist
02:00:53 not because i want to make a paycheck yeah man now go to my patreon and give me money
02:01:00 so i could do that um davoo says he needs more of the channels that he's been trying to catch up
02:01:05 on to announce one year hiatus is well there you go yeah i was i was gonna say like if if youtube is
02:01:15 only like the really good shit there will just be less it'll it'll it'll result in less people being
02:01:21 able to make it on youtube but i think that would be better because uh some people just don't have
02:01:26 any good ideas the field is a bit crowded now though i wonder if it would put us in a situation
02:01:31 where the people on the top just stay there kind of like the uh you know like the the steven
02:01:34 colbert channels and whatnot are just like cementing their place at like the top echelons
02:01:39 what i think has right now what i expect to happen over the next few years if this kind of
02:01:44 shit keeps happening is that gradually a lot of the youtubers on like the like several hundred
02:01:51 thousand subs or even million sub levels will start vacating the site and all the you know all the
02:01:58 industry shit will still be there but the audience wants those other guys like the audience is here
02:02:04 for the homegrown youtube content once that shit leaves there's not going to be enough people watching
02:02:10 the colbert shit on youtube gotta happen that's my hope too either it'll cause youtube to shrink
02:02:15 and become just netflix 2.0 which at some point will just mean netflix will buy it and completely
02:02:22 change it or like you know wait was there an or or they'll just die yeah that's the other i think
02:02:29 they will become purely corporatized in time i think that's what they already work i mean they
02:02:33 have youtube tv that's exactly what they're already on their way to do and for what it's worth i i don't
02:02:38 even blame youtube entirely for this because like they're too big it was too good of a service for
02:02:44 us i think like i think this idea of fully democratized content as beautiful as it was
02:02:50 was doomed to fail because not like we don't have the server space for every fuck off to make videos
02:02:56 you know yeah like in the world at this point we need this post scarcity society to come along
02:03:01 and fix that but like it's interesting because like there's a new website uh bit shoot i don't
02:03:07 know if anyone's heard of that site yet but it's not yet it's it's it's a new youtube competitor
02:03:12 and it's peer to peer so it's all torrent based but it's you host your videos and then you like
02:03:16 download torrents and that's how you so they they don't have any server space to worry about
02:03:20 because it's all peer to peer i can easily see that being part of the the future you know like i can
02:03:25 see that yeah i was talking about that in the comments or in the chat earlier about how the
02:03:30 ethereum network i don't know if you guys know anything about that it's like a project right now
02:03:35 that's like i i don't know much about it i want to do more research into it but i the general idea
02:03:39 is that it's a peer to peer internet so the entire network basically is designed to replace the web
02:03:45 as it is now and it's all decentralized and peer to peer so there's no central servers hosting
02:03:49 anything thank god fascinating fascinating uh i can't come fast enough
02:03:58 well i guess that's about it everybody yeah any other i think i think i think we're good so
02:04:03 everybody uh remember most of those questions this time came from our private discord so please
