00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:07 Entertaining you with all the weak snooze that makes you snooze, I'm the best guy ever.
00:00:12 And we've got Ben Saint over here.
00:00:15 Pretty fucking good. Hey, hey.
00:00:16 Thank you. On the top of my head.
00:00:18 On the top of your head, pretty good.
00:00:19 He guys heard about this British indie pop band from London, England, consisting of vocalist
00:00:25 Sarah Midori, Perry, and producers and multi-instrumentalist Gus Laban and Jamie Bullard.
00:00:31 And all their songs are about meat and butter.
00:00:34 That sounds good.
00:00:35 They're called Keto Keto Bonito.
00:00:38 But thank you, thank you.
00:00:40 I do shows, I do interviews, I'll do speaking gigs, you can contact my agent.
00:00:46 Is that a real band?
00:00:47 No, it's a Kero Kero Bonito joke.
00:00:50 I was hoping you'd say a London-based pop rock group, Sleep Tight, featuring two unnamed collaborators.
00:00:58 But let's get to one of those.
00:01:00 Give and take.
00:01:01 I mean, Sleep Tight's more like a Pacific or Atlantic ocean.
00:01:05 I forget which one, because it's like me and Munchie and we're like,
00:01:08 if you take the mean, the median average point, we are based in the ocean.
00:01:11 That's like the Atlantic somewhere.
00:01:13 Yeah, it's representative of the downfall of Western society, let's be honest.
00:01:18 And there he is, Tom Oliver.
00:01:19 Yeah, I'm ready to go see Joker and shoot up a theater, because I guess that's what we do now.
00:01:24 I do want to see that real bad.
00:01:26 Haven't gotten to it yet, looking forward to it.
00:01:27 I've actually heard pretty good things.
00:01:31 Well, you know, you hear a mixture of things, depending on who's talking at the time.
00:01:35 I haven't heard everything nowadays.
00:01:37 There's two versions of everything.
00:01:39 I haven't heard red-letter media or Yomo Yusaku's talk about it, so...
00:01:43 The only people who matter.
00:01:45 Just like everything.
00:01:46 There's two versions of everything.
00:01:47 There's the Dimension 1218 version and there's the Dimension C197 version.
00:01:51 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, pause.
00:01:53 Which side are you on?
00:01:54 Pause. This is important.
00:01:56 There is a completely polarized society that we live in now, especially with social media.
00:02:01 Is that evidence of the dimensional merge?
00:02:04 Is that why there's such a polarized social conversation?
00:02:08 Because this is actually the two dimensions coming together?
00:02:10 Tom, literally anything you want to be is evidence of the dimensional merge.
00:02:16 So, absolutely.
00:02:18 You want an evidence of the dimensional merge?
00:02:20 Look at my boy Joker crossover with Jeb right here.
00:02:23 This is everything I've been waiting for.
00:02:25 So good.
00:02:26 Now that's proof of anything.
00:02:29 Now that's pod racing.
00:02:30 God, I fucking love Jeb.
00:02:32 Okay, let's...
00:02:34 Why is he not running again?
00:02:35 What a travesty.
00:02:37 It's pouring out for the dimension we didn't get to experience, the Jeb dimension.
00:02:41 Quick update, everybody.
00:02:43 Jeb will rise again.
00:02:44 Lisa Simpson for president 2020.
00:02:46 Quick update, which is just...
00:02:48 So, I'm sure everybody saw.
00:02:50 So the PCB Minecraft server rolled out since we last spoke.
00:02:53 I mean, you had already heard it when the last episode came out.
00:02:55 But almost like 75 people have already joined.
00:02:59 It's an active community.
00:03:00 There's always people playing in there.
00:03:01 People have been building stuff.
00:03:02 I'm building Slime Corp HQ at this very moment.
00:03:06 No, guys, get in there and stop him.
00:03:09 You can't get away with it.
00:03:10 There's mining and crafting happening literally right now.
00:03:13 It's insane.
00:03:14 So, hey, $5 pledge, patreon.com slash PCB Minecraft.
00:03:18 If you want to play, come play with us.
00:03:20 It's going to be a good time.
00:03:21 Link down below.
00:03:22 When are we going to get a cameo appearance by our boy MC Fit?
00:03:25 He needs to bomb into the new hotness.
00:03:28 He should.
00:03:28 That would be pretty cool.
00:03:29 He showed up in the stream briefly.
00:03:30 Did he?
00:03:31 Oh, cool.
00:03:31 I tried to beg him.
00:03:32 He did.
00:03:33 Yeah, he did.
00:03:34 He did just for a moment.
00:03:35 I missed the first one, but I want to.
00:03:38 There will be many more to come.
00:03:39 I want to get in there.
00:03:40 Yeah, I want to get in there.
00:03:41 I need to.
00:03:41 I have to install a Minecraft.
00:03:43 Hey, we should go back to Bufalantopia.
00:03:49 You know what I wanted to do?
00:03:50 I was thinking to start a stream.
00:03:51 We do a goodbye stream at Bufalantopia.
00:03:53 Yeah, a goodbye stream where we have mage.
00:03:57 We all cancel all the zones, and then we just burn the whole thing down.
00:04:01 Oh, that sounds like a good idea.
00:04:02 Yeah, if we could make it.
00:04:03 We burn the sign.
00:04:04 We watch the sign burn.
00:04:06 We return the land back to the land.
00:04:08 Back to the Bufalant.
00:04:10 We release all the Bufalants into the wild.
00:04:13 What a great idea.
00:04:14 All right, look for that.
00:04:15 Look for that soon.
00:04:18 So what else is going on?
00:04:19 I mean, that was the one quick update I had.
00:04:21 Well, I have one.
00:04:24 I have an announcement.
00:04:25 I have an announcement.
00:04:26 As of right now, when you are hearing this, well, as of recording, the Vapors 2 Kickstarter
00:04:31 has $1,000 left to go to hit its stretch goal.
00:04:34 We hit the first stretch goal, which means everyone who pledged gets $15 and gets a dollar
00:04:38 back.
00:04:39 We did communism.
00:04:40 I made communism real.
00:04:41 Everyone's getting a dollar back.
00:04:43 I'll put a dollar bill in your fucking thing.
00:04:45 I will pay you, listener, to pledge to my Kickstarter.
00:04:50 And then if we hit $10,000, which as of right now we're $1,000, I don't know when you're
00:04:54 listening to this.
00:04:55 I don't know how close we'll be.
00:04:56 There'll be a free pin, a new third free pin that everyone will get $15 and everyone
00:05:02 gets a third pin.
00:05:04 It's the St. Heart.
00:05:05 Everyone thinks that people seem to really want this one.
00:05:07 I really want to make it.
00:05:08 Anyway, Vapors 2 Kickstarter, kickstarter.com slash projects slash Ben St. slash Vapors
00:05:13 2.
00:05:14 I'm, you know, I don't want to count my chickens ever, when before or after they hatch.
00:05:20 Even once they're hatched, I'm not entirely convinced of the reality, but I'm feeling pretty
00:05:24 optimistic about this next goal, 1,000 bucks left.
00:05:27 There's always that spike at the very end of most Kickstarter's film.
00:05:29 Last time there was a pretty significant spike at the end.
00:05:32 Will we have this one?
00:05:34 Only time will tell, but if you're listening to this right now, this is the last weekend
00:05:38 that you have until April.
00:05:40 So there's like two days left as they hear this.
00:05:42 It's time for the spike.
00:05:43 Make the spike real.
00:05:44 Go, go now.
00:05:45 The night of Sunday the 13th.
00:05:48 I did my part.
00:05:49 Have you done yours?
00:05:50 Yes.
00:05:51 It's the last night.
00:05:52 I've had my first Kickstarter ever with this one, so I'm just saying that's an endorsement
00:05:57 if there ever was one.
00:05:58 Remember, the most important thing is that the more money the Kickstarter makes and the
00:06:01 more people who buy the book, the more money I get for drawing the thing in the book.
00:06:06 Indeed.
00:06:07 Yeah, I'm giving all the guest artists, which I will get you a script soon, by the way.
00:06:13 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:06:14 I was going to bring it up.
00:06:15 That's my passive aggressive way of bringing that up.
00:06:18 All the guest artists will get, I'm giving them like a percentage basically, and yeah,
00:06:24 the more it gets sold, the more every guest artist gets.
00:06:27 They're already past last time.
00:06:31 Past last time.
00:06:32 Last time, we had 212 backers in.
00:06:35 This time, with a week left, we've already up to 236.
00:06:39 I think at this rate, I think I would need between now, like in the next seven days,
00:06:45 and when we're recording, seven days left, I would need at the average pledge amount,
00:06:49 which is like just under $40, I would need like 25 to 30 people to pledge at the average
00:06:56 at like a typical like $30, $40 amount, and that would hit the goal.
00:07:00 Seems doable.
00:07:01 So if you were, hey, viewer, you're one of 25 to 30 people.
00:07:06 Think about it.
00:07:07 About $40 of expendable income.
00:07:10 Think about it.
00:07:11 Think about it.
00:07:12 Okay, cool.
00:07:13 That's my piece.
00:07:14 Hurray, hurray.
00:07:15 Very exciting.
00:07:16 So what's the word in the world, everybody?
00:07:18 What's going on?
00:07:19 I've also had a fucking crazy week.
00:07:20 Why don't you tell us about that, Ben?
00:07:21 You want to hear?
00:07:22 Okay.
00:07:23 You want to hear about that?
00:07:24 Well, God, what even happened?
00:07:27 Where was this at last week?
00:07:29 Because the developments have been astounding.
00:07:32 I think the last time it was just you were doing a comic, and Chris Chan was just saying
00:07:40 it was cool and canon, and we were talking about how that's pretty funny.
00:07:43 You were hoping to not spook him away with 9-Eleven jokes and stuff.
00:07:46 You were talking about how you needed to bring Nightstar back in to reel him back into the
00:07:52 interest.
00:07:53 Oh, yeah, I was saying that Chris was like, not really.
00:07:54 Chris was like kind of there, she wasn't liking all the tweets, but she was still definitely
00:07:57 reading.
00:07:58 A lot has happened since then.
00:07:59 A lot has fucking happened.
00:08:01 Okay.
00:08:02 I mean, you know, we did 9-Eleven, right?
00:08:05 We all had a really big laugh, it was great time, everybody had a good time.
00:08:10 Okay.
00:08:11 The order of events here is really important for context, but I genuinely don't even know
00:08:16 the order of some of these events.
00:08:17 Well, at some, okay, so...
00:08:20 I think it was like you made it so that Phantom Horn saw the big green eye, and then...
00:08:26 Incredible artwork by the way.
00:08:27 After he died.
00:08:28 I loved that.
00:08:29 Thank you.
00:08:30 Yeah, I had a lot of fun drawing that.
00:08:31 I didn't make it that way.
00:08:32 That's what happened.
00:08:33 I saw it in C197.
00:08:34 Oh, really?
00:08:35 Of course.
00:08:36 None of this, I'm not doing it.
00:08:40 I mean, I'm just reporting on with the truth.
00:08:42 Are you that green guy in the, well, he died, right?
00:08:45 I mean, who are you in this?
00:08:47 No.
00:08:48 That was just a random juve.
00:08:49 Okay.
00:08:50 Are you the cop killer?
00:08:51 I mean, I...
00:08:52 You need to understand your dimensional, your fucking dimensional ontology here.
00:08:55 Clearly.
00:08:56 Clearly.
00:08:57 Right?
00:08:58 Okay, there's 1218, that's us.
00:08:59 I am 1218 Ben.
00:09:00 Just like there is 1218 Christine Weston Chandler.
00:09:04 There is an alternate version of each of us.
00:09:07 So then there is C197 Ben, who is the cop killer.
00:09:12 And then there is C197 Christine, which is Comet Christine.
00:09:16 There is HumbleJuve.
00:09:17 What about that?
00:09:18 Right, I was gonna ask about HumbleJuve.
00:09:19 HumbleJuve is not...
00:09:21 You would think HumbleJuve is an alternate version of me.
00:09:24 No.
00:09:25 HumbleJuve is just a guy who looks exactly the same and has the exact same name.
00:09:30 He is technically just a very similar person by coincidence.
00:09:36 Gotcha.
00:09:37 He is technically unrelated.
00:09:38 And then Phantom Horn is not an alternate version, he is an OC, and that's distinct.
00:09:43 And I am...
00:09:44 I could correct me in the comments if I'm wrong about this, but I believe the distinction
00:09:47 is that a alternate version, when the dimensional merge happens, the alternate versions will
00:09:52 merge like if they are well attuned to each other or something, they will merge into one
00:09:56 entity, whereas OCs will simply come into, you know, our newly created gestalt dimension.
00:10:04 Okay.
00:10:06 C119, whatever, it's like a combination of the digits.
00:10:11 So you will merge with the cop killer when this happens, is what I'm hearing?
00:10:16 Well, I would under certain circumstances, which Chris claims are no longer the case,
00:10:25 but I mean, let me just skip to the end, right?
00:10:27 Yeah.
00:10:28 This is like the movie where you see the end of the beginning, it's like the second season
00:10:32 of Breaking Bad or whatever, when you see what's his name floating in the pool, and it's
00:10:36 like, how did I get here?
00:10:37 And then the season is the story of how we got here.
00:10:40 Well, you know, as of right now, we got people, we got propagandists in Quickville spreading
00:10:44 the rumor that Slime City is slimeless, has been de-slimed, and that the cop killer has
00:10:50 been beheaded, and that his head has been taken into custody under Quickville with Chris,
00:10:56 Weston Chandler, and Magichan.
00:10:59 But this is false.
00:11:00 I can tell you, right?
00:11:01 I've looked at the other dimensions, this is false.
00:11:03 Endless War is saying, Endless War says that is a lie, that's propaganda, they just painted
00:11:08 a watermelon purple, Endless War provided photo evidence that that's true.
00:11:13 So I-
00:11:14 I haven't seen that yet.
00:11:15 Okay.
00:11:16 It's on Twitter, Endless War tweeted, it's like, do not believe the lies.
00:11:18 Okay, I'm gonna try and give like a succinct-
00:11:20 It's just like Arrival, by the way, time for Nate's movie lessons, Saw Arrival, Time Loop,
00:11:25 there you go, that's all I have to say.
00:11:27 Okay, cool.
00:11:28 I'm gonna try and give a succinct summary, okay?
00:11:30 So Chris, oh man.
00:11:33 So Chris-
00:11:34 Started drawing the, they're like, at the moment Phantom Horn was beheaded and they
00:11:41 died.
00:11:42 Yes.
00:11:43 Chris Chand took it upon themselves to start drawing what happens next.
00:11:47 Basically, yeah.
00:11:49 And Chris decided that what happened next is night stars, and there are drawings of this,
00:11:54 and there's like text dumps of this.
00:11:56 And most bafflingly of all, all of it is chronicled, not in a comic, but in the form of images
00:12:06 and flavor text on an expansion-packed set of Twilight Sparkle's secret shipfic playing
00:12:14 cards.
00:12:15 This is the format that Chris decided was the best way-
00:12:18 Is that what those are?
00:12:19 I thought it was-
00:12:20 Yes.
00:12:21 That's what the deal is with the format.
00:12:23 All right.
00:12:24 So there are cropped images of text on cards, because all of these were, this is a 15-card
00:12:31 Twilight Sparkle secret shipfic folder expansion-pack, and yes, and they detail how nightstar gets
00:12:38 Phantom Horn and strawberry milk to send her a sample of the slime.
00:12:42 She does tests on it, and then she sends Chris Chan Sonichu, like, you know, comic Chris
00:12:50 in Sonichu form.
00:12:52 Along with the other forces of Quickville, like lots of flying Sonichus, I don't know,
00:12:56 just a whole bunch of them, and nightstar determines that slime's weakness, something
00:13:00 that can wash slime away, is a mixture of water, sugar, and bicarbonate of soda, which
00:13:05 I believe is baking soda, but I forget.
00:13:08 So they create a storm of this and rain it down on Quickville, and their story is that,
00:13:15 oh yeah, this washed away all of the slime city.
00:13:18 Not Quickville.
00:13:19 Did I say, oh, did I say Quickville?
00:13:20 Yeah.
00:13:21 New Los Angeles City, aka Neo-Milwaukee.
00:13:24 So they say that, yeah, they rain for 24 hours, wash all the slime away, the city's no more
00:13:33 slime.
00:13:34 No more slime.
00:13:36 The implications of this are staggering, absolutely staggering.
00:13:39 But it's fake news.
00:13:42 It's fake news because, you know, the city's still there, the city's still running, and
00:13:46 Los Juarez said its propaganda, the rain did happen, and the death toll is counted
00:13:53 at about 70,000, and this is confirmed by Chris herself on Twitter, who says that 1%
00:13:59 or 99% of the population of Arizona survived, meaning that 10%, 1% died, population of Arizona,
00:14:06 about 700 million, so 70,000 people died in the bicarbonate rain.
00:14:11 This is, she did not back off from this, she confirmed this to be true.
00:14:15 So 70,000 people were killed when called out on this act of literal genocide.
00:14:20 Christine said that all those people were, that was just the bad ones.
00:14:24 Just the bad ones died.
00:14:25 And I believe, there was something along the lines of like, I mean, hey man, to make
00:14:30 an omelet, you gotta break a few eggs, I mean, these things happen.
00:14:34 That was Christine and Magi Chan's stance on the issue, is that it was just the bad
00:14:39 ones that died, and it was for the greater good, so don't worry about it.
00:14:42 That sounds like, I don't know, that could be approximately the population of Slime
00:14:46 City, I mean, they would be the ones to die if anyone from, I mean, these numbers may
00:14:50 be loose or who can say.
00:14:53 Me and Chris agree, we agree that 70,000 people died, but the population of Slime City is
00:14:59 above that, it was a terrible, terrible holocaust basically, but we're still here, we're still
00:15:06 here, we're queer, get used to it.
00:15:09 And so that's happening, you know, Chris claims to have, or, word on the grapevine, is that
00:15:16 they have the cop killers head in a jar, it's just a watermelon, I've seen it, don't worry
00:15:20 about it.
00:15:21 Yeah.
00:15:22 I'm filled with comfort by that.
00:15:24 Yeah, same, man, so, oh, I forgot to mention also at some point in this, Chris joined Endless
00:15:34 War, tried to play it, died a couple times.
00:15:39 Made up a couple of her own fake commands, like exclamation point, infinite revive, and
00:15:44 exclamation point, moxby dash, and then declared, so died a couple times, declared that like
00:15:53 game sucks, games over, Slime's fake, there's no more Slime, games over the end.
00:15:58 And then when it made these cards, making it so.
00:16:02 I spoke to someone who had in their possession, the medallion of Chris, stripped from their
00:16:09 neck.
00:16:10 I forget who that, but that's like a real thing in Endless War now, it's an actual item, someone's
00:16:14 carrying around.
00:16:15 There is a medallion, one of the people who slant cab.
00:16:19 Possibly one of the Endless Rocks.
00:16:21 Cab and dupes.
00:16:22 Perhaps.
00:16:23 I think they each got one kill, they both scalped her, so, and then there was complicated
00:16:28 series of trades that I won't get into.
00:16:30 The cop killer now possesses both of Christine's scalps.
00:16:34 And unlike this claim about the head and the jar, the cop killer can provide photo evidence
00:16:39 that this is the case.
00:16:41 I can type in exclamation point inventory right now, concrete proof, undeniable.
00:16:49 So that happened, the mayor of Quickville joined the server died.
00:16:53 Man.
00:16:54 I remember looking on Twitter, there was Phantom Home and Strawberry Milk.
00:16:59 I like how Chris Chan's interpretation of Strawberry Milk was very accurate.
00:17:04 It is.
00:17:05 It's shockingly self.
00:17:06 Strawberry Milk is always thinking pervy thoughts and talking about sex and it's really funny.
00:17:10 Yeah.
00:17:11 She kind of got to be like better than I did.
00:17:16 I was talking to Munchie and I sort of realized that like, you know, I kind of wrote Strawberry
00:17:20 Milk basically exactly like I would write keg.
00:17:23 I was thinking the same, I was saying to everyone that we all know Strawberry Milk is just a
00:17:27 knock off value brand keg standard, trying to fill the role of a greater character.
00:17:33 And I think, yeah, I wrote him to Broi.
00:17:36 I was talking to Munchie and he says that Strawberry Milk is really not much of a bro.
00:17:40 He's just like a gross perv.
00:17:41 And I was like, hmm, shit.
00:17:44 So I don't know.
00:17:45 You got to introduce keg standard into this narrative.
00:17:48 So Chris will draw a keg standard.
00:17:50 I mean, there needs to be a nod.
00:17:53 There needs to be nods to him at some point.
00:17:55 He's absent in the narrative.
00:17:57 It speaks volumes, Ben.
00:17:58 It speaks volumes.
00:18:00 I would love for Chris to draw some more, but, you know, I guess we'll see.
00:18:05 Dude, I want to fucking, I understand now, I don't want to undercut you, but Chris has
00:18:09 made certain demands of you to fund certain projects that's what I'm getting to.
00:18:13 Okay.
00:18:14 So Chris makes these cards explaining, you know, what really had quote unquote really
00:18:19 happened.
00:18:20 Yeah.
00:18:21 And so, you know, it was propaganda to propagate among the citizens who all love Twilight
00:18:26 Sparkle Secret Chip and Folder, literally the best way to get news out is to create
00:18:29 an expansion pack of Twilight Sparkle Secret Chip and Folder because everyone will read
00:18:33 it.
00:18:34 Nobody reads it.
00:18:35 It's an untapped market for sure.
00:18:36 Yeah.
00:18:37 That's basically, that's the Twitter of Quickville is Twilight Sparkle Secret Chip and Folder.
00:18:43 So Christine makes these cards and then she's messaging me, you know, she's been saying
00:18:49 like, she's been saying like, love your work and stuff.
00:18:52 Like we've been DMing a little bit and then, you know, she's very complimentary.
00:18:55 And then MagiChan, no, she says, I'm going to send you a copy of the cards.
00:19:01 And then MagiChan messages me and MagiChan says, hey, Ben, so, and I tweeted some of
00:19:11 these screenshots.
00:19:12 He's like, hey, Ben, so, hey, don't appreciate the greedy way you've been using our characters.
00:19:19 Don't appreciate the greedy way you've been profiting off of our something.
00:19:25 You know, I want you to contribute to the production of this card game, this expansion
00:19:40 pack.
00:19:41 So I expect you, and this is after Chris has already said, like I'm sending you like a
00:19:46 copy of the game of the expansion pack.
00:19:50 And I expect you to put a generous donation of $300 or more into Christine's PayPal account.
00:19:58 Here's the link.
00:19:59 Okay.
00:20:00 Have at it.
00:20:01 So is this like MagiChan?
00:20:04 Or like it's like Oral, it's basically it's like Oral's like, it's like a vague threat,
00:20:09 but there's no actual like, it's a threat that like, if you don't like, you will, like
00:20:15 everyone will know you're a bad person and like,
00:20:17 Well, Ben, you know, you know, you have to do, you know, you have to do, you have to
00:20:21 $13,000 stretch goal on, on the Kickstarter.
00:20:25 Oh, send Chris, they're, they're deserved earnings, they're fair share of the profits.
00:20:32 I mean, all my, I mean, even if, I mean, all the money from the Kickstarter is going directly
00:20:36 into slime coin.
00:20:38 So that's, I can, I really can only pay in slime coin, you know, I told her all my
00:20:43 money's tied up in slime coin.
00:20:46 That will continue to be the case for a foreseeable future, especially with this whole rain ecological
00:20:51 disaster.
00:20:52 Now, like the economy is just so clogged up, there's just, yeah, it's, it's, it's slime
00:20:57 coin or nothing.
00:20:58 It's slime.
00:20:59 It's really a slime coin or nothing to think all this could have been avoided if someone
00:21:02 had just given Chris Chan exclamation point diplomatic immunity and none of this conflict
00:21:08 would have even been started.
00:21:10 That's true.
00:21:11 I was so nice.
00:21:12 I was in the red carpet, gave her a custom role, did some custom artwork, a celebrating
00:21:16 the new alliance between quick fill in new Los Angeles city and what, and she responds
00:21:21 with genocide.
00:21:22 This is what I get.
00:21:23 I don't know.
00:21:24 I don't, I don't, you know, I'd love it if we could reestablish diplomatic relations,
00:21:28 but the way she's behaved, I don't know if it's going to happen.
00:21:32 Who's the troll now?
00:21:33 When you think about it, all this complaining about, oh, you're just fucking trolling.
00:21:37 Christine's the one who bombs into your server commits mass genocide and then it tries to
00:21:42 extort you for money.
00:21:43 I don't know.
00:21:44 It's like, I want a hundred percent agree with you.
00:21:47 It's like going into the ocean and saying, oh, oh, fish, let me take care of this pesky
00:21:51 water for you getting in the way.
00:21:52 Let me just get that out of here.
00:21:54 Yes.
00:21:55 That's, you know, what a great, what a great, yeah, yeah, yeah, like, it's like, oh, hey,
00:21:58 what's all these fish jumps in water, oh, oh, it's wet, hey, water gone, don't worry.
00:22:04 This water's gone.
00:22:06 Problem solved.
00:22:07 Welcome Moxby Dash.
00:22:09 What's the, I need to sever your addiction to this water.
00:22:13 I know better.
00:22:14 You can't be relying on this anymore.
00:22:15 You have to be set free.
00:22:18 My favorite, yeah, Chris just decided that like, oh, Slime's evil.
00:22:21 Actually, no, Slime's evil and fuck all of you.
00:22:24 I would really like to know, Ben, how you felt like the, like, initially it was just like
00:22:32 Christiana has drawn phantom horn and strawberry milk at last, and then realizing that she's
00:22:38 like, like trying to destroy Slime.
00:22:42 Yeah.
00:22:43 Talk about the monkey's paw in a fact.
00:22:46 Indeed.
00:22:47 Exactly.
00:22:48 Exactly.
00:22:49 I knew, I knew what was going to happen.
00:22:50 I, like, Chris had been, every time Chris had mentioned Slime up until it had been in
00:22:53 a negative context, like, I, I already knew, like, I knew where it was going.
00:22:57 I just didn't know how quick it was going to get there.
00:23:01 And it ended up being, like, three days from when, like, the first card was published when,
00:23:05 you know, phantom horn was on the card, and I was like, oh, my God, phantom horn, oh,
00:23:08 my God, New Los Angeles City, Chris Druitt.
00:23:11 And then, and then you, she releases the last cards and it's like, okay, yes, this is Slime
00:23:16 Genocide.
00:23:17 I was like, I knew, I knew exactly what was going to happen.
00:23:20 My favorite thing about-
00:23:21 I had hoped that it would be left open, like, because I, this really, this is what's really
00:23:28 frustrating, right?
00:23:29 Because I haven't, there is an ending in mind for the phantom horse robbery milk comic.
00:23:34 Chris doesn't know what it is.
00:23:36 I've told her there will be a happy ending.
00:23:38 There will be a happy ending, but it is not the happy ending Chris envisions.
00:23:42 Of course.
00:23:43 But Chris just decides that, like, okay, so obviously at the end, obviously what needs
00:23:48 to happen, this is so fucking annoying.
00:23:52 Obviously the phantom and strawberry come back to Equestria, leave the city, the city
00:23:57 is destroyed because it's a bad, evil place.
00:24:00 And also phantom horn gets his horn, after all, he gets a magic horn.
00:24:04 Fuck you.
00:24:05 Like, no, never.
00:24:06 I mean, it's, it's so sad.
00:24:07 It's just cheesy writing there, Chris.
00:24:09 It's just cheesy writing.
00:24:10 It's just, it literally just, like, you know, honestly, I felt a little bit personally attacked
00:24:16 by that one.
00:24:17 So that's completely unacceptable.
00:24:21 Not canon.
00:24:22 Phantom will never have a real horn, a biological horn.
00:24:25 Fuck you.
00:24:26 Never.
00:24:27 Never, never, never.
00:24:28 No.
00:24:29 Besides, that's how you know.
00:24:30 That's the smoking gun that lets you know that this is all fake news and propaganda.
00:24:34 For no other reason then.
00:24:35 I mean, if we, if we give phantom horn a quote unquote real horn, aren't we undermining the
00:24:39 reality that he does in fact have a horn already because he identifies as such.
00:24:44 So there can be no distinction made between phantom horn now.
00:24:48 It's ridiculous.
00:24:49 It's ridiculous.
00:24:50 It's all, hey, you know, you know this, you spent your whole life, your whole character
00:24:55 arc, learning to accept yourself despite what you see as your physical shortcomings.
00:25:00 How about at the end of that, oh, but here, here it is, though, you don't have to learn
00:25:05 any, I didn't learn anything.
00:25:07 I can't believe you would criticize Chris Chan's stellar storytelling that there could
00:25:12 be any way that it, yeah, underlines character arcs or undies.
00:25:16 Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.
00:25:17 Anyway.
00:25:18 I do feel like this is a really cool arc, though, like this is Lord of Ghost levels
00:25:24 of destroying the city.
00:25:26 We've got a, you know, really powerful enemy now, exclamation point war, you know.
00:25:32 Yeah, there, there is, there, in the game, there is like the bicarbonate reigns, Magix
00:25:38 Rampage put them in the game and they are now a hazard in the game that can kill you
00:25:42 and your slime lids.
00:25:44 Well, the good news is, N8 and Slimecorp have been reaping incredible profits from umbrella
00:25:49 sales.
00:25:50 Yes.
00:25:51 Bicarbonate proof umbrella sales.
00:25:52 That is also a thing in the game.
00:25:53 It's been one of the literally, mechanically, it's there.
00:25:57 The day, the day that I woke up to all of this like slime destroying storm sort of bullshit.
00:26:04 I read all of the tweets.
00:26:05 I was like, holy shit, I got out of bed and I immediately started drawing like more of
00:26:09 the red man noir comics so I can lick it into having the rain in it because it's so inspiring.
00:26:16 Are there more of those red men?
00:26:17 I hadn't seen them before, but like yesterday I was just on Twitter and I, or maybe the
00:26:21 day before and I was like, what is this red man?
00:26:23 What is this like?
00:26:24 What is this fucking noir?
00:26:25 What is this red man?
00:26:27 Okay.
00:26:28 Yeah.
00:26:29 Red man's character design has changed.
00:26:30 He's now like a detective.
00:26:33 Slime alteration.
00:26:34 He's rouge man.
00:26:35 He's like red man noir.
00:26:36 Sure.
00:26:37 I mean, it's the next logical step.
00:26:38 That last explosion Robin of all was blood.
00:26:39 But the thing that started it was Kip, like typed exclamation point harvest and nothing
00:26:47 happened.
00:26:48 That endless war chastises you because harvest is not a command.
00:26:52 He says harvest is not a command you fucking idiot.
00:26:55 So I was like, oh, is that changed?
00:26:56 And I typed harvest and then endless war yelled at me and not Kip.
00:27:00 And I was really upset and I was like, how are you doing that?
00:27:03 I copied Kip's text exactly, posted it and endless war yelled at me again.
00:27:08 So I was like, okay, there's some secret going on here.
00:27:10 Please tell me.
00:27:11 Kip was like, no.
00:27:13 And then red man donned his trench coat and hat and like interrogated Kip.
00:27:19 And that's when I drew red man, the detective.
00:27:21 And that is his goal.
00:27:22 He's trying to find out how to harvest without getting yelled at.
00:27:27 Wait, red man is or Kip is?
00:27:30 Red man is.
00:27:31 Kip will not like tell him the truth and this is the story that started and then it started
00:27:40 raining, slime destroying rain.
00:27:41 I'm like, let's let's tie this in.
00:27:43 Let's make this like a real narrative thing.
00:27:45 That's very noir-esque.
00:27:46 Yes.
00:27:47 Heavy rain outside.
00:27:48 Yeah.
00:27:49 Yeah.
00:27:50 Yeah.
00:27:51 Right.
00:27:52 It works.
00:27:53 It just works really good.
00:27:54 It's really fun.
00:27:55 I really hope that we can have some, forgive my, forgive my coom brain right now, but sexy,
00:28:00 you know, noir-esque damsel in distress or just secret agent gun girl with like fishnet
00:28:06 stockings in the size.
00:28:08 Leggy damn.
00:28:09 Oh no, your lipstick and like Jessica Rabbit from Who Shot Jessica Rabbit or whatever that
00:28:15 movie was.
00:28:16 I love that movie.
00:28:20 You know what I'm talking about.
00:28:26 So that's where the Chris Chan drama stands right now.
00:28:30 I'm sure it's not over.
00:28:32 No doubt.
00:28:33 No doubt.
00:28:34 Well, we'll see.
00:28:35 We'll see.
00:28:37 Neither Chris nor Madge Chan has yet to respond or they both have yet to respond to Endless
00:28:43 Wars declaration that, you know, the head, the head, the rumors about the head of the
00:28:47 cop killer are false and I mean, you know, obviously with this rain continuing, tensions
00:28:54 between the city are growing, you know, this keeps up the alliance is definitely going
00:28:57 to break down, you know, there may be war on the horizon, but you know, thoughts, thoughts
00:29:02 and prayers.
00:29:03 Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
00:29:04 I guess.
00:29:06 I'm getting rowdy.
00:29:07 Not in the good way.
00:29:08 But fucking cool, cool news and this is pretty cool.
00:29:12 I am the article of the now on the quickie.
00:29:16 I am the article of the now on the quickie.
00:29:18 Ben, it's actually pretty good.
00:29:21 It is pretty good.
00:29:22 I read through it.
00:29:23 I read through it.
00:29:24 It's not bad.
00:29:25 It's not that, I mean, it's missing some stuff and it gets a little wrong here and there,
00:29:30 like it's pretty mostly accurate, pretty neutral, like the only thing I don't like the picture
00:29:38 they use because they use that fucking picture of me at Digi House.
00:29:41 Yeah.
00:29:42 That I hate, but like whatever, God, I really wish, I really wish it were the, they could
00:29:49 get the picture of me in the in the Chinese pajama pants squatting next to the fire hydrant
00:29:54 saying vaping is not a crime.
00:29:56 Can't you edit a wiki?
00:30:00 It seems to be like lockdown.
00:30:01 Really?
00:30:02 I didn't want to do it, but like people were telling me that like they were trying to like
00:30:05 make accounts and it's like you need permission or something like I don't know what the deal
00:30:10 is.
00:30:11 Disgusting.
00:30:12 Cowards.
00:30:13 Cowards all over.
00:30:14 Can I have a link to this, this article?
00:30:15 I got it right here.
00:30:16 I got it right here.
00:30:17 It's.
00:30:18 All right.
00:30:19 You gotta dig through this shit.
00:30:20 There you go.
00:30:21 That fucking picture, you know, like it's fine.
00:30:23 It's fine.
00:30:24 You know, it's just like, it's okay.
00:30:25 Overall, I'm pretty good with it.
00:30:27 I'm pretty good with it, but like that fucking picture will haunt me for the rest of my life.
00:30:32 Yeah, probably.
00:30:33 It's not even like a bad picture.
00:30:34 I don't know whatever.
00:30:35 It's pretty okay overall.
00:30:36 It's fine.
00:30:37 It's a silly expression I guess.
00:30:38 There could do.
00:30:39 I mean, I could do so much.
00:30:40 It could be.
00:30:41 Yeah, at least it's not fat band.
00:30:42 Oh, at least it's not fucking fat band.
00:30:45 Yeah, that's true.
00:30:46 Yeah.
00:30:47 It's just now only in the annals of, well, I guess the lecture and, and T-Bap resurrection.
00:30:53 And there is, um, there is a screenshot of Chris dying an endless war on here.
00:30:57 You know, it's good stuff.
00:30:58 There's good stuff.
00:30:59 Everyone should definitely go check it out.
00:31:00 It is interesting.
00:31:01 And I mean, it's a, what a culmination of a, of a career spent in,
00:31:05 Here we go.
00:31:06 Crystorian life.
00:31:07 Information.
00:31:08 Name Ben St. also known as the cop killer, Phantom Horn.
00:31:12 There you go.
00:31:13 Yeah.
00:31:14 It's, it's, it's canon.
00:31:15 Legendary.
00:31:16 Amazing.
00:31:17 Amazing.
00:31:18 And I can't believe you, Ben.
00:31:19 You yourself are the feature of the update.
00:31:20 And this is the not so good news we've just heard about on the web.
00:31:23 It's you, Ben.
00:31:24 It's you.
00:31:25 Update.
00:31:26 I'm article, I'm article of the now.
00:31:27 My article is now tagged forever that it was once article of the now that is a distinction
00:31:31 I will take to my grave.
00:31:32 Mm-hmm.
00:31:33 Mm-hmm.
00:31:34 Oh, this is very, very exciting.
00:31:36 What a life.
00:31:37 You gotta update your Twitter bio.
00:31:38 Gotta, gotta flex this article.
00:31:39 Article of the now on the.
00:31:40 Hey, not bad.
00:31:41 Not bad.
00:31:42 Yeah, maybe.
00:31:43 That's great.
00:31:44 Maybe it will.
00:31:45 That's, it's, uh, not everyone can lay claim to such a distinction.
00:31:48 It's true.
00:31:49 Okay.
00:31:50 I was thinking about something on this subject.
00:31:52 This is, it's a slightly more serious thing.
00:31:54 I don't, it's not a big deal.
00:31:56 It's not anything crazy.
00:31:57 I just had a thought and I was curious what you think about it, Ben.
00:32:00 It was just that, okay.
00:32:01 Yeah.
00:32:02 Because obviously some people have been arguing with you about like Chris Chan's, uh, pronouns
00:32:06 and identifying.
00:32:07 Oh my God.
00:32:08 Oh my God.
00:32:09 I know you've been, you've been getting into some arguments about that.
00:32:10 I'm, I understand.
00:32:11 I don't, I hate these people, Nate.
00:32:13 I get it.
00:32:14 I fucking hate these people.
00:32:16 They're such fucking dicks about it.
00:32:19 They're such, uh, aren't you, aren't, aren't you a hypocrite?
00:32:22 Aren't you a hypocrite for insisting that we not misgender someone while you make fun
00:32:28 of them for unrelated things?
00:32:30 You like, no.
00:32:31 No, no.
00:32:32 You grow a fucking brain.
00:32:33 I've been saying that that's consistent.
00:32:34 Grow a fucking brain.
00:32:35 You're fucking moron.
00:32:36 Okay.
00:32:37 I hate them.
00:32:38 But I, I, I get the, the kind of idea they're getting at and I, I had this question to say.
00:32:41 That's okay.
00:32:42 I get the idea and it's fucking stupid.
00:32:43 It's the product of a fucking diseased mind that can't think, that can't make logical
00:32:46 connections from one thing to another.
00:32:48 I thought I had one interesting point about this, which was just that, um, okay, so we
00:32:52 all know that, like, so this idea of the dimensional merge, right?
00:32:55 That was like planted by the idea guys or whatever.
00:32:58 And it's, it seems, it seems to be the case.
00:33:01 Okay.
00:33:02 It was, it was, it was, I think it was, yeah, more or less.
00:33:05 Okay.
00:33:06 I, I had heard, I had heard, you can correct me if I'm wrong, again, I'm, I'm gonna just
00:33:11 take Chris at his word.
00:33:12 I don't, it heard or worried.
00:33:13 It doesn't matter to me.
00:33:14 I had heard that this idea of being trans might have also been planted sort of by trollish
00:33:22 people.
00:33:23 And I was just thinking, if that is in fact true, and I think it, it could be true, then
00:33:29 does that change the dynamic of like, you know, what would the multi-dimensional, dimensional
00:33:33 merge thing that's planted by people who are trying to fuck up Chris?
00:33:36 That makes it worth like, okay, I mean, should we question it?
00:33:39 If this was also like planted in some way, should we, is it then, you know, something
00:33:44 similar to question in some way?
00:33:46 Okay.
00:33:47 All right.
00:33:48 Let me tell you what I, let me tell you what I said on Twitter.
00:33:50 Someone said something similar.
00:33:52 I was like, okay, I get what you're saying.
00:33:55 What did, what did I say?
00:33:56 That seems to me to be the only reasonable case of like, why you would have a, well,
00:34:00 here's, here's, here's what I think about that.
00:34:02 Okay.
00:34:03 Okay.
00:34:04 So this is what I said on Twitter.
00:34:05 Someone made a similar argument and I said, here's why I disagree.
00:34:08 There is no way to look into some, I don't know why I'm, I don't know why I'm quoting
00:34:11 myself, but I don't feel like thinking about it.
00:34:13 I really said, there, there is no way, there's no way to look into someone's head or whatever
00:34:17 and say if they're quote unquote really trans, the only criteria we actually have to go on
00:34:22 is if someone says they are.
00:34:24 So if someone, anyone, even Chris, right?
00:34:27 Chris doesn't know anything, right?
00:34:28 Chris doesn't understand gender theory, doesn't matter because I understand it and, and they
00:34:33 don't need to get it.
00:34:34 They don't need to be, they can be wrong and I still want to be right.
00:34:37 Sure.
00:34:38 So if someone tells you their pronouns, there is nothing to appeal to as an argument for
00:34:41 why they're wrong.
00:34:42 Interrogating someone's reasons for why they say their pronoun preferences are what they
00:34:46 are is just missing the point that the only reason that matters is their preference itself,
00:34:51 right?
00:34:52 I don't know.
00:34:53 I guess what it comes down to, there's no higher authority.
00:34:56 There's no like, there's no like scientific truth of the matter.
00:35:00 Like this is literally just like a language thing.
00:35:03 And so if they're, if they say like the only, the only act, the only fact of the matter is
00:35:10 what they say and that's, that's it.
00:35:13 So if they say, if they say female pronouns, please, it's like, well, what, what, I don't
00:35:19 think there's nothing to appeal to be like, oh, well, here's why actually you're wrong.
00:35:22 Like, no, no, you can't, you just, you just can't do it.
00:35:26 It is unassailable.
00:35:27 It's, it's like, like somebody saying, you know, I have this opinion and then someone
00:35:33 else going, well, I disagree that you have that opinion and it's literally the same level
00:35:38 of objection.
00:35:39 Yeah.
00:35:40 So you are, I agree.
00:35:41 I think you're correct.
00:35:42 However, just let me put this example forward.
00:35:44 Let's just say theoretically, so one of these trolls came forward and said, yes, here was
00:35:48 my experience.
00:35:49 I was talking to Chris, I trolled Chris, but they were secure in their male identity.
00:35:55 Then I came in and began convincing them they're female.
00:35:58 This was my work.
00:36:00 They did not believe before I did this.
00:36:02 Now you're still correct.
00:36:03 We didn't do anything, their opinion is of their opinion, but if we know they were like
00:36:07 manipulating this way, are we doing the right thing to, to not in any way object?
00:36:12 Well, I'm trying to paint an example where we know it was done by an outside force.
00:36:15 Yeah.
00:36:16 Okay.
00:36:17 If we know it was manipulation, then does that change anything?
00:36:19 Yeah.
00:36:20 Like what, like such like, like everybody's manipulated, like, like the, the idea that
00:36:26 manipulation is different from just learning or like hearing about this new idea.
00:36:31 No.
00:36:32 Cause like, all right.
00:36:33 It's the context in like a macro sense is different.
00:36:37 But like in terms of like Chris's own head, it's the same thing.
00:36:40 I mean, I agree.
00:36:41 I agree.
00:36:42 Which, which it's unfortunate, but it's also true.
00:36:44 Well, I don't know.
00:36:46 Like, yeah, like we're all, I don't know, we're all, we've all, we've all been manipulated
00:36:51 by like the, the, our circumstances of existence.
00:36:54 The thing, the thing is like some people, um, you know, only say they're trans after hearing
00:36:59 about it.
00:37:00 And if it, you know, when trans things were like nobody ever heard about them, nobody
00:37:05 ever talked about them.
00:37:06 It was like, you know, years and years ago, I didn't even know that that was a thing.
00:37:10 Um, but like if people hear about it and then they say, like, oh, that's me, then are they
00:37:15 being manipulated with new information?
00:37:17 Or is it just that now they have an, like they have a word and a, like an understanding
00:37:22 of the thing they've been going through.
00:37:24 I don't know whether Chris was like, you know, maybe he was easily manipulated into that.
00:37:28 But like if he likes it or she, I'm sorry.
00:37:32 Yeah.
00:37:33 I get it.
00:37:34 It, we're talking in like past and present tense at the same time.
00:37:38 Yeah.
00:37:39 It gets, it gets really confusing and people have, uh, I think lightly tease me thinking
00:37:45 that I've accidentally said he, when I've actually been talking about Magi Chan, cause
00:37:48 like when I talk about Magi Chan, you gotta, I say he, and like, you know,
00:37:53 It's a whole other layer to the, because obviously they are in every sense of the word
00:37:59 distinct individuals.
00:38:00 Um, and Magi Chan is not just an alt that is being used to try and squeeze money out
00:38:05 of me.
00:38:06 No.
00:38:07 Literally Magi Chan is like the fucking good cop or the bad cop to Christine's good cop.
00:38:10 Like Christine's all nice to me and stuff.
00:38:12 And then Magi Chan is like, Hey, give us that fucking money, by the way.
00:38:16 Uh, thanks.
00:38:17 Uh, I'll be waiting.
00:38:18 I'll be waiting.
00:38:19 Um, and if you don't, um, I will come, I will come to you in soul form and obliterate
00:38:23 you.
00:38:24 So, all right.
00:38:25 So Magi Chan.
00:38:26 All right.
00:38:27 In terms of like, uh, that's one of Chris's accounts.
00:38:32 And like to type that Chris Chan had to type it.
00:38:35 Is it canonically that Magi Chan, like types through Chris Chan?
00:38:39 No.
00:38:40 It was that way for a while.
00:38:42 Canonically, um, as part of like the ongoing merge, um, okay, first, and this was sort of
00:38:48 like when I was kind of getting clued into what the, was the goings on more in Chris's
00:38:52 head.
00:38:53 Um, it was, uh, uh, Chris and Magi Chan had swapped minds.
00:39:00 We talked about this on another episode.
00:39:01 We did.
00:39:02 They had swapped minds.
00:39:03 So for a while, Magi Chan was in our dimension, but in Chris's body, like inhabiting her form.
00:39:10 Then they swapped back, but Magi Chan actually did like make the physical transition.
00:39:17 So canonically, Magi Chan physically exists now in our dimension.
00:39:21 And there are some screenshots.
00:39:22 I've seen those.
00:39:23 Those are incredible.
00:39:24 YouTube videos.
00:39:25 Oh, it's just one frame cause he's so fast.
00:39:27 You can see Magi Chan.
00:39:28 A and Y pony appears.
00:39:29 I mean, Chris linked like that one.
00:39:32 Yeah.
00:39:33 Okay.
00:39:34 Here it is.
00:39:35 I just found it in one fucking frame at 4535 in this fucking video.
00:39:39 Okay.
00:39:40 I'm getting the link right, right here.
00:39:41 Wait, wait, wait.
00:39:42 In like two frames of that video, Magi Chan is there behind A and Y pony and like, there
00:39:48 he is.
00:39:49 There, there's, you know, you know, the funny thing was, the funny thing was I went to this
00:39:52 video, I watched it through at that moment.
00:39:54 The damnedest thing.
00:39:55 I couldn't see Magi Chan.
00:39:56 It was weird.
00:39:57 I mean, I mean, you would have, you would have to pause at the exact right frame and
00:40:00 like, what are the odds that anyone could do that?
00:40:02 I mean, with the speed of Magi Chan, I mean, we know that like a computer, a camera only
00:40:06 renders it most.
00:40:07 It's going to be like 60 frames per second.
00:40:09 That's way too little time.
00:40:10 I mean, with YouTube compression, it's really not, it's no surprise that you're, you couldn't
00:40:14 pick them up even with frame by frame scrubbing, you know, obviously going to be between the
00:40:19 frames.
00:40:21 Did A and Y pony turn around that he'd like, oh, what's on my shoulder?
00:40:24 A and Y gave no sign of, of noticing, but just that fast because he's been touched on
00:40:29 the shoulder.
00:40:30 If Magi Chan didn't want to be noticed, he wouldn't be.
00:40:32 What's that command?
00:40:33 Spin dash away.
00:40:34 Exclamation point.
00:40:35 Mox speed dash.
00:40:36 Mox speed dash.
00:40:37 Yeah.
00:40:38 Magi Chan totally Mox speed dashed right out of there.
00:40:41 This whole Mox speed dash is bothering me because in Sonic, there is an upgrade called
00:40:45 the light speed dash.
00:40:46 And the fact that Chris didn't go with that is mildly.
00:40:49 That's worse.
00:40:50 Mox speed dash is so much worse.
00:40:54 The second one is really.
00:40:55 Yeah.
00:40:56 Just looking straight at the camera.
00:40:57 Magi Chan.
00:40:58 That was at 3210 in the video.
00:41:00 Incredible.
00:41:01 Oh my God.
00:41:02 I love that it appears on an A and Y live stream.
00:41:03 Dude, I wonder, I wonder if Magi Chan is going to appear in this PCP episode.
00:41:06 Magi Chan went so fast, not even in the video at all.
00:41:09 Oh my God.
00:41:10 You're right.
00:41:11 He might be in it.
00:41:12 He might be here among us right now.
00:41:13 He's probably visited all of us, like while we're on here, just to make sure that we're
00:41:18 not slandering his and his wife's name.
00:41:21 It's kind of terrifying.
00:41:22 We are not.
00:41:23 Praise the God.
00:41:24 What is it?
00:41:25 Exclamation point, infinite revive, exclamation point, goddess protection, exclamation point,
00:41:30 goddess healing.
00:41:31 Is there any irony in the fact that it's a live stream of them discussing the God Delusion
00:41:35 by Richard Dawkins?
00:41:36 Is there some symbolism involved in this particular?
00:41:39 Is that true?
00:41:40 Is that really?
00:41:41 Yeah.
00:41:42 They're reviewing the God Delusion.
00:41:43 That's fucking rich.
00:41:45 That's fucking rich.
00:41:47 By the way, I just want to point out, my favorite, this amazes me that one of the panels that
00:41:51 Chris Drew is Chris Chan Sonichu holding up a slime podron, the one that Phantom Horn
00:42:00 mined on his first mining.
00:42:02 He holds up the slime podron and he discusses it, and I forget his exact wording, but he
00:42:07 calls it a podron.
00:42:08 He says a slime podron and he says that it can be used as a healing crystal with minor
00:42:13 slime side effects, which is absolutely true, and literally what it does in the game, or
00:42:17 one of the things it does in the game.
00:42:19 He knows what's up.
00:42:20 He literally says this thing is good, this is a good item, and then he says, oh, but
00:42:25 slime is all evil and he tries to obliterate all slime.
00:42:29 It's funny to me how it attentive Chris Chan is.
00:42:35 The fact that he was attentive enough to, she, fuck, getting confused, talking about magic
00:42:41 Chan.
00:42:42 She's attentive enough to talk about the podron and call it by its proper name.
00:42:49 The fact that enough care was put into it, enough consideration was given that she learned
00:42:53 the word podron and used it is like, oh, that fucking is like success, mission accomplished,
00:42:57 we got her.
00:42:58 By the way, Ben, so Chris was on your case, and okay, I loved some of these tweets about
00:43:04 like, hey everyone, just letting everyone know that it's also ugly is going to be financing
00:43:10 this expansion.
00:43:11 Yeah.
00:43:12 I mean, okay.
00:43:13 Incredible.
00:43:14 And everyone will love the fact that Ben is going to be paying for it.
00:43:17 I love that fact.
00:43:18 I really do.
00:43:19 Why would anyone else care about that?
00:43:20 I could not be going to put that social pressure on you, Ben, you know?
00:43:23 Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
00:43:25 That's what it is.
00:43:26 It's like, it is like a weird like sort of like social bullying kind of thing.
00:43:30 It's like, well, now I got it, now I got it, because she said I will.
00:43:33 I think that was the intent on Ironclash.
00:43:35 It's absolutely, absolutely that was the intent.
00:43:38 Okay, but be amazing.
00:43:39 So, not only is Chris literally like kind of extorting you for this money, but also
00:43:44 like talk about, in a way, in a way, not exactly, but they're whatever.
00:43:49 Any normal person did this, we'd be like, well, this is fucked up.
00:43:52 What the hell?
00:43:53 But like beyond that, Chris is getting on your case for using her OCs and like, you
00:43:59 know, cloud chasing and whatnot, and yet is making, is using phantom horn and strawberry
00:44:04 milk and endless war rampantly in her own work.
00:44:07 I mean, the hypocrisy is off the fucking charts here.
00:44:11 She literally, you know, that's funny.
00:44:14 I didn't even consider like, it's actually even worse than it sounds, because she
00:44:17 literally does the exact same thing.
00:44:19 Exactly the same.
00:44:20 That she demands that I pay her for, like we both do the same thing to each other.
00:44:26 And then she says, okay, well, now you have to pay me for both things.
00:44:31 It's, you have to pay, you should pay me.
00:44:34 MagiChan literally says, the two reasons are, like one, because Chris made the cards, you
00:44:41 should pay her.
00:44:42 And also because you use the characters, you should pay her.
00:44:45 Yeah, exactly.
00:44:46 Are you fucking kidding me?
00:44:47 You're you, and then Chris is using the setting, you should pay her.
00:44:49 You know what it is?
00:44:52 I feel a little bad because I know, and I have had interactions with these people, there
00:44:57 are some like, there are some real, there are some real fucking like weird kids or something
00:45:03 that like, Chris thinks are her friends that are like, and like, this is, this is their
00:45:08 influence, I think, like I think, I think some people that Chris, that have tricked Chris
00:45:12 into thinking they are her friends, they're definitely not, they're very, very not, very
00:45:18 much not, I'm sure.
00:45:19 But I don't know, I think these people are telling her to do this.
00:45:23 So I'm maybe not as mad as I would be.
00:45:26 I feel like, I mean, she shouldn't do this, but also someone else is telling her to, I
00:45:31 don't know.
00:45:32 It sucks, and I don't like it, but there's nothing I can do.
00:45:37 If I, honestly, I wish I could get rid of these people, like literally for Chris' sake,
00:45:46 I wish I could get rid of these, I don't know, weird pseudo trolls slash white, and I don't
00:45:53 know, a lot of them seem to be pretty, they're either like really, they might be kind of
00:45:58 sick people themselves, honestly, like they seem unhinged.
00:46:02 Just on that one grilling of you on that live stream doesn't speak too highly.
00:46:06 I think it's like they put themselves forward as if they were white knights, but clearly
00:46:13 some of them have ulterior motives that just like fucking with Chris, but they sort of
00:46:17 shield themselves with people who do care about Chris.
00:46:21 I think a couple of them genuinely think that they do, like there was that one girl who
00:46:25 seemed genuine, and then all the other ones were just like, yeah, make it interesting
00:46:29 though, yeah.
00:46:30 Yeah, that one.
00:46:31 Hey, we're gonna dox you, hey, give us your, give us your, give us your, send, you better
00:46:35 send Chris all the money from whatever, from the comic that you're putting for free on
00:46:40 Twitter.
00:46:41 Indeed.
00:46:42 And then, I don't know, just, and there's like, there's like a weird little cabal of
00:46:47 people that are all associated with this person who is like sort of Chris' internet boyfriend
00:46:52 or something, and they all seem like, there's something wrong with them, I don't know what's
00:46:56 going on, I don't like, I don't like thinking about them, and I don't care, like to me the
00:46:59 least interesting part of the Chris thing is like the real life antics, like my favorite,
00:47:05 my favorite Chris stuff was Alec Benson Leary who made Asperchu, and which was, you know,
00:47:12 which was like a comic, and, and, and liquid Chris, which was basically just like an extended
00:47:17 role play thing, like these, this was like, these were like fake, these were basically
00:47:21 like fake story arcs that people just invented, and that's just like, that's so much more
00:47:26 interesting to me than like, I don't know, what if we made Chris shove the medallion up
00:47:32 her ass?
00:47:33 Yeah, like that's fucking lame.
00:47:35 Or like destroy their PS4, PS3 or whatever was, I mean, there's a certain amount of hilarity
00:47:40 in there.
00:47:41 Oh, okay, well, I mean, that was a little funny.
00:47:42 I mean, yeah, when, when, when you get Chris to do something herself, that, that, like
00:47:49 that's what's funny, and, and the, the, I don't know, I don't, I don't, I don't care about
00:47:53 that stuff.
00:47:54 I kind of like that to think about it, but I guess it's, I guess it's all interwoven
00:47:57 now.
00:47:58 Some people have compared, like me and the, and the Nightstar comic to like Alec Benson
00:48:01 Leary and Asperchu, which I'm flattered by that, because that's, that was a good arc.
00:48:05 I would, I would, if I were, if I were, if I were, if I were, if I were remembered in
00:48:08 Crystery as another Alec Benson Leary, I would say Mission Accomplished, great job.
00:48:13 I did everything I wanted to do out, that was a good, it was a good arc, boys.
00:48:18 Yeah.
00:48:19 Anyway, so that's, feel a little bad, feel a little bad for Chris being manipulated,
00:48:25 but also like fucking, get the fuck out of here, this $300 bullshit.
00:48:29 I mean, well, we all know Chris is not a perfect individual, many, many character, personality
00:48:35 flaws, et cetera, et cetera, but I mean, yeah, I feel bad for anybody who's being taken advantage
00:48:39 of.
00:48:40 I mean, I guess you could say that, like, your involvement makes you somewhat part of
00:48:45 that, but I mean, not, not, I don't think it's fair to give you the, the, you know,
00:48:49 I haven't done anything.
00:48:50 I haven't done anything wrong.
00:48:52 I'm adamant that everything I've done.
00:48:54 You've really only drawn a comic at the end of the day.
00:48:56 That's really, and yeah, it's involved with Chris and Chris is a long time ago.
00:48:59 I've just drawn a comic and if Chris's reaction to that involves some like weird psycho shit,
00:49:05 like I don't think that's on me.
00:49:07 I really don't.
00:49:08 Yeah.
00:49:09 I don't know.
00:49:10 Maybe the criticism would just be like to get involved with Chris period and openly
00:49:13 invites these sorts of things and they're inevitable.
00:49:16 So there's, you know, some.
00:49:19 Victim blaming.
00:49:20 No, it's not.
00:49:21 Well, don't, you're blaming me.
00:49:22 The victim.
00:49:23 Uh, well.
00:49:24 How short was that skirt, Ben?
00:49:26 Perhaps you, uh, deserve.
00:49:29 Uh, good.
00:49:30 You know what?
00:49:31 Good point.
00:49:32 Okay.
00:49:33 Touche.
00:49:34 Um, boy.
00:49:36 What a fucking week.
00:49:37 Okay.
00:49:38 I think, I think that's everything.
00:49:40 How close are you to the end of Phantom Horon's comic?
00:49:44 That's a good question.
00:49:47 Well, we're in the sewers right now.
00:49:49 Uh, I'm not going to say exactly what's going to happen, but I think where it's probably
00:49:54 maybe two thirds.
00:49:55 I think I've been saying for a while that like it's almost done.
00:49:58 It's almost done.
00:49:59 Um, but it's, it's getting there.
00:50:01 It's, uh, I know.
00:50:02 Well, like acts one, two or three.
00:50:05 Where are we?
00:50:06 This is, uh, this is probably late act two.
00:50:08 Okay.
00:50:09 It's cool.
00:50:10 Okay.
00:50:11 Yeah.
00:50:12 Yeah.
00:50:13 This is like, this is late act two.
00:50:14 Well, I'm very interested to see where it goes.
00:50:15 I'm not sure what it's going to be like, but it is interesting to note that like when
00:50:18 you're waiting for a Ben, uh, you know, like Vapors chapter, it's like, uh, Skeleton sitting
00:50:23 at computer waiting for the update.
00:50:25 But with this, it's like, every fucking day, there's like, basically every, basically every
00:50:32 fucking day.
00:50:33 Yeah, it's great.
00:50:34 It's, it's wonderful.
00:50:35 Well, I think it just speaks to the nature of the distribution of the product.
00:50:38 You know, when you're working on the Vapors, you get no short term, uh, response.
00:50:42 But with this, you're getting feedback and like engagement every day.
00:50:45 It's got to be addicting.
00:50:46 I mean, just a positive feedback cycle of, you know, people, plus you're contributing
00:50:50 to something bigger than your own work, something that you've been following religiously for
00:50:54 years.
00:50:55 Yeah.
00:50:56 Yeah.
00:50:57 Yeah.
00:50:58 And like this.
00:50:59 Yeah.
00:51:00 There's like, I'm getting constant feedback about it.
00:51:01 It feels really good.
00:51:02 And also the sense that like I need to strike while the iron is hot on this.
00:51:05 Yeah.
00:51:06 If I, if I left it, it would be a big missed opportunity to let this go cold.
00:51:09 So it's, um, and also I'm just really excited to, cause I have a really, I have a really
00:51:15 an ending in mind for it that I really like.
00:51:17 And it's just a, a story that I really want to be out there in the world.
00:51:21 I'm just saying, Ben, wouldn't it be amazing if at the end of this, you also somehow in
00:51:26 another way released this in some physical medium that one could put next to your other
00:51:31 Ben words.
00:51:32 I'm thinking about it.
00:51:34 And at some point, I would love that all the custodians would buy a copy.
00:51:37 It's Christian.
00:51:38 At some point, that's, that's when you'd have to give Chris a $300.
00:51:41 Oh, he's right.
00:51:42 He's right.
00:51:43 I mean, it's like 120 or 140 pages long at this point.
00:51:47 So, well, like pages, I mean, panels, right, right.
00:51:51 But you know, Twitter size images, but like, yeah, no, it's long enough to be like a little
00:51:56 mini book.
00:51:57 So, um, yeah, honestly, at some point, I think I probably will do that.
00:52:00 Ooh, I look forward to it.
00:52:01 I want that too.
00:52:02 Yeah.
00:52:03 Yeah.
00:52:04 I've been thinking of like the potential like, and maybe when I do, maybe, maybe like
00:52:10 I make a bunch of money off and then I'll maybe I'll send, I'll send Chris $300.
00:52:14 You are using his OCs.
00:52:15 I did.
00:52:16 I did you.
00:52:17 I did use your OC in this.
00:52:19 I did do that.
00:52:20 And as a show of goodwill, here, here you go.
00:52:23 Here you go, friends.
00:52:25 I've been thinking myself about like making like book comic things and like whether Bale
00:52:31 Jap would, would work because there's a lot of panels in that, there's a lot of text.
00:52:36 It would work probably the same as like, uh, like a problem sleuth where the gifts would
00:52:41 be just, you, you, Dave wouldn't be animated a series of images, but like that's technically
00:52:48 possible.
00:52:49 For sure.
00:52:50 But I don't really feel like, I don't really feel like getting into another Kickstarter
00:52:53 before like, I know like the viewer base is big enough, at least the finished project
00:53:00 though.
00:53:01 I mean, you know, it already exists.
00:53:02 It's just a matter of do enough people want it to be on print and willing to buy.
00:53:05 Maybe like when you finish like the next work or whatever, or have that started, that'd
00:53:09 be a good time.
00:53:10 Well, give, you don't even need to run a Kickstarter.
00:53:12 You could just put it on like KDP on Amazon and just have it be a print on demand book.
00:53:16 And if people want it, they buy it.
00:53:20 Is that a thing?
00:53:21 Yeah.
00:53:22 Now that's what we're looking into.
00:53:23 Like I would design the entire like PDF of it or whatever and then you just upload it
00:53:27 and people order it, they buy it.
00:53:31 How did it all work with like covers and then hardback and paperback and the size of the
00:53:36 book?
00:53:37 They have like, you know, they have templates and you download and you format the templates,
00:53:42 the book to the templates and stuff.
00:53:44 I mean, people self publish all the time.
00:53:46 That's how it works.
00:53:47 You just upload it and people can buy it.
00:53:51 That's our, I'll look into that.
00:53:53 What was it called again, Tom?
00:53:54 It's just on Amazon.
00:53:55 You just go to Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing and you can do whatever the fuck you want.
00:54:00 And then you're on Amazon.
00:54:01 So could you do that with like a fully like illustrated?
00:54:04 Yeah.
00:54:05 People publish comics through Amazon all the time.
00:54:07 Okay.
00:54:08 Okay.
00:54:09 Man, I wonder if like, because I have given absolutely no care at all to like color formatting.
00:54:15 It's all just, there's a gradients all over the place.
00:54:18 I feel like, I feel like physical printing would probably run into problems with the
00:54:21 colors on a lot of my pages.
00:54:23 I mean, Amazon has decent quality.
00:54:25 I mean, it's going to be easier to print through Amazon that would be to like busting
00:54:30 out a laser printer yourself and like grinding through it, you know?
00:54:33 Yeah.
00:54:34 Yeah, probably.
00:54:35 So yeah, I had thought about this.
00:54:38 Like, I'm like, this is like, this is like approaching book length almost.
00:54:44 And yeah.
00:54:45 I definitely like the idea of having physical comics.
00:54:49 Yeah.
00:54:50 Yeah.
00:54:51 Absolutely.
00:54:52 Like manga collection, Lane, there's too many of those, like too many volumes for
00:54:56 each manga.
00:54:57 Like comic book collection is just the coolest thing ever.
00:55:00 The only comic series I really want to own is One Piece.
00:55:03 Other than that, just to have it all there to look at and appreciate.
00:55:06 But other than that, like I just kind of want stuff that like has particular value, like
00:55:10 all year guys' work I would love to have and, you know, that kind of stuff.
00:55:13 I mean, I wouldn't want to collect like huge series of stuff, because then it becomes like
00:55:16 unmanageable.
00:55:17 But like, if there's like one to five volumes of something that I really care about, like
00:55:21 that's fucking sick to just have on the shelf.
00:55:24 Indeed.
00:55:25 Oh yeah.
00:55:26 Speaking of that sort of stuff, I recently just purchased the original black and white
00:55:32 Scott Pilgrim volume one to six box because I have just finished reading it for the first
00:55:39 time.
00:55:40 Really?
00:55:41 Yeah.
00:55:42 You never read the whole thing?
00:55:43 What'd you think?
00:55:44 You never read the whole thing?
00:55:45 I did not.
00:55:46 I did not.
00:55:47 I always meant to.
00:55:48 Never got around to it.
00:55:49 It's pretty solid.
00:55:50 It's really good.
00:55:51 I like something like it like seeing the movie and knowing that it's cool and stuff.
00:55:58 I always felt like I should, but I'd never got around to reading it.
00:56:02 But it's it's surprisingly like, I was not surprisingly way better in terms of a lot
00:56:09 of things.
00:56:10 It's different.
00:56:11 The movie's good.
00:56:12 But like so much of like how the story is structured with all of the seven or something
00:56:19 evil exes and the amount of like the volumes are all like each is a self contained like
00:56:25 part of the narrative.
00:56:27 It deals with a different aspect of romance with Ramona and the evil exes related to that
00:56:34 and everything that happens in that volume is related to that sort of thing, that sort
00:56:38 of problem.
00:56:40 And it's like, it's really clean.
00:56:42 It's very clean as they say.
00:56:43 It is very clean.
00:56:44 So there is, I did reread it a couple of years ago and I was struck with the feeling
00:56:50 of like, yeah, a lot of this stuff in the middle.
00:56:54 I can see why they didn't make it in the movie.
00:56:57 I feel like it's a little bloated in the middle.
00:57:00 Like in the one that sticks out in my mind is the, okay, you know, there's the vegan
00:57:04 guy Todd, right?
00:57:05 Is it the vegan guy?
00:57:07 In the manga, there's like an extended sequence in like the third or fourth book or something
00:57:12 where like they, they had the part of their battle is they have to do like a race through
00:57:20 this one Canadian like chain store and like the challenge is that they keep being blinded
00:57:25 by all the deals.
00:57:27 Okay.
00:57:28 That's funny.
00:57:29 It's like, oh yeah.
00:57:30 I didn't understand that.
00:57:31 No.
00:57:32 Yeah.
00:57:33 You'd have to be, it's just like a really stupid joke that only a Canadian would find funny.
00:57:36 And even then I think they would probably, it seems a little eye rolly.
00:57:39 I don't know.
00:57:40 It's funny that it's there.
00:57:41 It's like, it's a little charming that it's there, but also like, I can see why they skip
00:57:47 this.
00:57:48 Yeah.
00:57:49 Yeah.
00:57:50 I mean, there's a lot of like stuff in like the middle.
00:57:52 There's a lot of like extraneous other characters that come in that are like really tangential
00:57:56 and tertiary.
00:57:57 I mean, I can't think of too many that are like pointless.
00:58:01 Like that thing with Todd in the supermarket was like pretty pointless, but like.
00:58:07 There's like other girls that show up.
00:58:09 There's like another, like Scott's old classmate shows up and he like wants to fuck her for
00:58:13 a while, but she just goes away later.
00:58:16 Yeah.
00:58:17 But she plays into like the thing that he's dealing with with Ramona at that point is sort
00:58:21 of like a, like a rejecting her, like staying true to Ramona was like a thing that allowed
00:58:26 him to do.
00:58:27 I can't exactly remember.
00:58:28 Yeah.
00:58:29 I don't either.
00:58:30 Like I can't analyze it off the top of my head, but I felt like that it was all like
00:58:36 properly put there.
00:58:38 Like it was very deliberate, very goodly done, but most mostly what I really love about Scott
00:58:44 Pilgrim is just sort of like, yeah, why not like feeling to everything?
00:58:47 Yeah.
00:58:48 That's true.
00:58:49 It has a lot of attitude.
00:58:51 It has like a just a really good fun attitude to the way that it's just like, it's great
00:58:57 and it's like reserved.
00:59:01 It's reserved in the fact that it doesn't go ridiculous and it only goes ridiculous in
00:59:06 the places where it would be like most, you know, beneficial emotionally for the reader
00:59:12 to, for it to go that ridiculous, like near the end and all that.
00:59:16 It's just, you know, it can do anything, but it doesn't do everything, which is great.
00:59:21 I just, I just really appreciate it.
00:59:23 It's an instant classic.
00:59:24 Obviously, lots of people already knew this, but I, I finally, I finally read it.
00:59:29 And if you saw my Twitter, I drew alley-oop in the style of Scott Pilgrim and people like
00:59:34 that.
00:59:36 The debate rages on about whether the black and white versions versus the color versions.
00:59:42 And a lot of people say that the color adds a lot, which seems to be, it seems like it's
00:59:47 a pretty high quality coloration, but the fact that the black and white was the way
00:59:52 it was originally published, just, I don't know, it gives it a sense of like, this was
00:59:58 how this was, this was what, like historically, this is the work that got popular and then
01:00:03 it was changed later and given color.
01:00:05 And just something about the fact that like this was the product as originally delivered
01:00:10 that had that impact, that made that impact, that became what it eventually did, just gives
01:00:15 it like an inherent value to me.
01:00:17 Same with like one piece, which has a colored version that exists out there, but we all
01:00:21 know that the black and white was the, it's, it's hard to imagine because I, I, I read
01:00:27 it like illegally on illegal.com and I saw the color version first.
01:00:32 I read all that, but I decided to buy color version online, like, uh, I don't know how
01:00:39 good it is in print, but like the scans or like the, the PDF, whatever it is, it's perfect.
01:00:45 It's really, really good.
01:00:46 I mean, like perfect quality, but like, um, the coloration is like, it's really good.
01:00:50 Like I can't imagine it having no color.
01:00:53 And so that's why I'm buying, I'm buying like the physical, uh, colorless one so I can read
01:00:58 it differently.
01:00:59 And you know, Ben, on the subject, I actually gotten probably cost a lot less to, it probably
01:01:02 true.
01:01:03 Yeah.
01:01:04 Yeah.
01:01:05 Each color one is like 26, like, uh, buckaroos, but like the black and white is like 15 for
01:01:13 the whole set.
01:01:14 So I definitely get in that.
01:01:15 That's, uh, that, that's fucking, that's good value right there.
01:01:19 Yeah, for sure.
01:01:20 Indeed.
01:01:21 Uh, so yesterday on my stream, uh, somebody asked me a question that was like, we were
01:01:24 talking about like subs versus dubs a little bit and I, I like, I had made a point in my
01:01:28 last we Agua that was like, whenever something exists that is like the original, but like,
01:01:35 okay, you got your traditional, you got your anime, obviously it's in Japanese first.
01:01:38 Um, my, my thing I want to do, I don't hate all dubs, but I always will want to hear it
01:01:44 in the original version first.
01:01:46 That will be my preference, all things considered, because it's obviously going to be the closest
01:01:50 to like the base artistic, you know, vision of the creators who are Japanese, even something
01:01:56 like, like space dandy, for example, was simultaneously produced in Japanese and English at the same
01:02:01 time and released that way.
01:02:03 But nonetheless, by knowing the fact that the guys like are Japanese who made the show,
01:02:08 that just makes my brain think that the Japanese one is like, there's things that translate.
01:02:13 It's kind of hard to capture everything in Japanese and English and like cultural differences.
01:02:17 I mean, if the dialogue was written by a Japanese writer, then I guess you could say that like,
01:02:22 even if it was simultaneously produced, you know, it was still like written in, in Japanese.
01:02:27 It's just like the time it was, which I imagine it was.
01:02:29 I feel like though, like space dandy is one of the, the closest it comes to have the English
01:02:36 version just being like almost better, like, like it's at least equal.
01:02:41 I did like the dub of space dandy a lot.
01:02:44 And like, if there's a choice, I mean with language, it's different from like color versus
01:02:49 non color.
01:02:50 Experience whatever I feel like, and that'll be my initial one.
01:02:52 And then I can make a judgment later.
01:02:55 I don't have like a preference for what was originally intended necessarily.
01:02:58 But with language, I guess I, I don't really have a, I guess it's just usually whatever
01:03:07 I click on first.
01:03:09 I was watching Karakana and I initially started watching the dub just because like, you know,
01:03:16 maybe it's good, I don't know.
01:03:18 But the, the, the boys like character voice was like super deep and like chocolatey and
01:03:24 like that didn't fit as like character design at all.
01:03:28 It was like too old, like, like a 34 year old man and like a teenager's body didn't work.
01:03:34 So I switched to Japanese and it was immediately incredible.
01:03:38 So like, I always like to do a little bit of testing the waters because I, I don't assume
01:03:43 all dubs are worse.
01:03:44 So I might try them, but sometimes I just forget to try them.
01:03:48 I just, I, I want to get the original version.
01:03:51 I don't know.
01:03:52 I already said something about that.
01:03:53 Yeah, I need to.
01:03:53 I feel like I'm getting, when you watch the original original, it feels like you're getting
01:03:57 the historical context in a way that you're not getting as much with like an adaptation
01:04:03 or a translation or a remaster or whatever.
01:04:08 That were both released simultaneously.
01:04:10 Oh, I mean that, yeah, then I think you, well, you know, that's, that's closer to the original.
01:04:17 You know, there's a thing with that because like with video games, remasters and emulation
01:04:23 and remakes and stuff, I would generally like them, the earliest version of the thing, but
01:04:32 I think realistically in the, in the, in the ways that as like consoles break down and nobody's
01:04:38 making these old consoles anymore, these old games on these old hardware is going to be harder
01:04:43 and harder and much more expensive over time to play.
01:04:46 And so it's like,
01:04:49 Like an emulation.
01:04:50 Yeah, but that's the thing.
01:04:50 And emulation is not always the same as how it plays on the original hardware on like a
01:04:56 CRT television and stuff.
01:04:57 Like it's designed for that kind of television.
01:04:59 It's designed to be played in a certain way with certain hardware.
01:05:03 And if you don't, if you can't get the hardware, you may as well just judge it based on how
01:05:08 emulatable, like how the emulation works, because getting all of that stuff, like if you,
01:05:13 I mean, I was thinking about this when I used to review things.
01:05:17 What is the purpose of reviewing the original version of something when somebody would need
01:05:21 to like invest so much money in order to play it properly?
01:05:25 When there's the emulation, there's like worse.
01:05:29 So like, do you review that as the game or do you not, or do you review both?
01:05:34 You know, it was a fascinating example that did you once brought up years ago,
01:05:37 which was that during design of games for the Game Boy Advance, I don't know if he knew this
01:05:41 for sure, but it seemed to be his impression that like when designing for the Game Boy Advance,
01:05:46 which did not have an inherent backlight or anything, they deliberately seemed to
01:05:50 artistically choose really bright colors for the games that they were designing,
01:05:54 because they had to make up for the fact that there was no backlight and they were playing
01:05:58 with like, you know, whatever light was in the area.
01:06:01 So brighter colors and whatnot would stick out more and be easier to register on the screen.
01:06:06 And now if you're just playing that on an emulation on your fucking TV,
01:06:09 it can look like fucking neon crazy shit.
01:06:11 I mean, sometimes it's a little too much.
01:06:13 I'm so used to how Fire Emblem seven and eight look on my Game Boy Advance
01:06:17 SP with the little weak backlight that had.
01:06:21 And then emulating it is like, it's too vibrant.
01:06:25 It feels like a different game or like a lower quality version of the same game,
01:06:31 where like you just up the contrast and now like there's no nuance in the colors,
01:06:36 even though, you know, the original is the emulation.
01:06:41 Yeah, yeah.
01:06:42 I mean, that even happened during the Game Boy Advance's lifetime itself,
01:06:45 because you had the original Advance, which had no backlight.
01:06:48 Then you had the first SP, which had the side light, like the side lit screen.
01:06:52 So kind of wash the colors out.
01:06:54 But then they released the actual backlight version, which changed everything again.
01:06:57 And then that was like super saturated.
01:06:59 Which one was the folding one?
01:07:00 Like the laptop one?
01:07:02 That was the SP.
01:07:02 But like they released two versions of it.
01:07:04 They released another one that had an actual backlight.
01:07:06 Oh, I didn't know.
01:07:07 And that like because it was backlit, it was way more saturated the colors.
01:07:11 And it looked like super over.
01:07:14 I think I have the side light SP because.
01:07:17 If you can turn the light off and still play it, it's the side light one.
01:07:20 Maybe not.
01:07:21 With the actual backlight, you turn it off and the whole screen turns black.
01:07:24 Game Boy Advance SP, little laptop, adorable case, folded up.
01:07:28 Backlight for the first time ever.
01:07:29 Oh my God.
01:07:30 And essentially a fucking charging cable so you can play forever and never have to stop.
01:07:36 The SP was a life changer.
01:07:38 What a revolution.
01:07:39 Like the best thing in the world.
01:07:41 Incredible.
01:07:42 I can now play under my covers with the lights off, except my Game Boy.
01:07:45 Oh, I used to do that all the time.
01:07:47 Fucking based.
01:07:48 Same here.
01:07:50 How many of you.
01:07:50 I wondered why I was so tired.
01:07:52 How many of you with that Game Boy Advance SP power would hide it from your parents by
01:07:59 closing the screen, saying, good night, I'm going to bed now.
01:08:02 I'm going to be asleep.
01:08:03 Oh, of course.
01:08:03 Then you turn it back and flip it back open.
01:08:06 Love that.
01:08:07 Yeah, those.
01:08:08 Those fools, those naive fools.
01:08:10 They didn't understand technology and I did.
01:08:12 I am the new generation.
01:08:13 Exactly.
01:08:14 Yep.
01:08:15 You didn't.
01:08:16 There's a literal intellectual stratification going on between you and your parents at this time.
01:08:20 They couldn't even comprehend what was going on before their eyes.
01:08:24 My parents grew up playing fucking Pong.
01:08:26 Pong came out like the first shoot ever on my mom's when she was a kid.
01:08:31 And now we got fucking SP.
01:08:33 Now we got Pong too.
01:08:35 Insane.
01:08:36 Yeah.
01:08:37 Now we got Pong too.
01:08:39 There's no going back.
01:08:41 He's being a Pong.
01:08:42 I saw, you guys know the channel Ahoy?
01:08:45 Nope.
01:08:46 I don't know.
01:08:47 I'm not sure.
01:08:47 Okay.
01:08:48 It's a really weird channel and it has like two or three really good videos and one is on the
01:08:54 history of Polybius, you know, like the fake video game.
01:08:58 Yeah.
01:08:58 I know that.
01:08:59 I don't know.
01:08:59 And they just released another or this guy.
01:09:02 I think it's just one guy or maybe he's got a team.
01:09:04 I don't know.
01:09:04 He released another one about like what's the first video game.
01:09:07 And it's like, you know, he goes like space war for some computer.
01:09:13 That's there's it kind of tennis for two, right?
01:09:16 Tennis for two on the yeah.
01:09:18 He talks about all these.
01:09:20 There's there's a couple other ones that are like contenders that I had never heard of.
01:09:23 It's good.
01:09:24 I really like these two like history videos are great.
01:09:29 The rest of his channel is dog shit.
01:09:32 It's amazing.
01:09:33 Like really?
01:09:34 These videos are really well researched, well written, well produced, great content.
01:09:39 The vast majority of his channel is complete shit.
01:09:43 It is like.
01:09:44 How so?
01:09:45 It's like he'll it'll all be some of them are talking about a specific game and some of them
01:09:50 are talking about he has tons of videos that are just a like exploration of a of like a
01:09:57 particular weapon like a specific like the talk about the rocket launcher.
01:10:01 And he'll just talk about like every game that's ever had a rocket launcher in it.
01:10:05 So I guess like the history of the rocket launcher, the history of the AR 15, the history.
01:10:10 They get a lot of views.
01:10:11 I'm seeing like millions of views.
01:10:12 They get millions of views.
01:10:13 They suck.
01:10:14 They're so bad.
01:10:15 I've seen a couple of them and it's okay.
01:10:17 And it's just why are they bad?
01:10:19 They're bad because I tried watching some and they all feel like I'm not learned.
01:10:26 It's not really learned.
01:10:27 Like maybe he'll talk a little bit about the gun itself.
01:10:29 It's like I don't really care about that.
01:10:30 But like fair enough, that's relevant to the subject.
01:10:33 But like then he'll go through, he'll elaborate about the gun each and it's literally just like
01:10:39 it just feels like each one is just like a five second blurb where he like talks about like
01:10:44 in this game, this gun is really good.
01:10:47 And here's like, in this game, this gun really gives you a fucking punch for your money, bro.
01:10:53 But in this game, it really was felt like the dog shit and was bad.
01:10:59 And this one, it really captured the way that the fucking bullet comes out fast and makes you go, ah!
01:11:06 I hate, I was so amazed by the disparity in quality between these two videos that I love
01:11:12 and everything else he has, which I hate.
01:11:14 Those strange like 107 facts videos where the number of facts dilutes the
01:11:21 interestingness of every fact.
01:11:24 Yes, yes, you watch, like you start one of these videos and it's like
01:11:29 two minutes into the actual knowledge, you're like, I'm over it.
01:11:32 I'm so over it.
01:11:33 I don't need to hear anymore.
01:11:35 No more, please.
01:11:37 I noticed that this guy went seven months without a video since this new video game
01:11:41 one just came out two days ago.
01:11:42 Well, I mean, I hope that means he's pivoting towards making stuff like this,
01:11:46 because like this and the Polybius video are really great videos.
01:11:49 Super good.
01:11:51 The Polybius one is like, I've watched it like four times.
01:11:55 It's excellent.
01:11:56 Damn, it's an hour, eight minutes long.
01:11:58 All right, well shit, I gotta check that out.
01:12:00 Link in the description.
01:12:01 That reminds me a little, you know, the guy I talked about who is crossing Wales,
01:12:06 the country, the country Wales is not a whale.
01:12:09 Yes.
01:12:11 He crossed it in a straight line, you know, he finished that series,
01:12:15 but the rest of his channel had up to that point been GeoGuessr videos.
01:12:20 And, you know, like, basically he goes into a thing and he's like, hmm, well,
01:12:26 you know, he's very good at GeoGuessr.
01:12:28 He can guess the countries pretty accurately by looking around.
01:12:31 What is GeoGuessr?
01:12:32 It's a Google Maps based game where it plops you in a random location
01:12:37 and you have to look around for a bit and then guess where you are in the world.
01:12:42 And you can use like road signs and like language things and like environmental clues,
01:12:49 like figure out where you are.
01:12:50 And he's very good at it, but they're very boring.
01:12:52 They're just the sort of like, it's a let's play show.
01:12:55 And it's like, if you don't really care about it.
01:12:58 Yeah, you know, like doesn't sound gripping.
01:13:01 So like he does that and then he does this walk across Wales video.
01:13:06 Most incredible video series on YouTube this year or like the last five years probably.
01:13:12 And then he's finished.
01:13:13 And then he goes back to GeoGuessr videos and like obviously nobody cares.
01:13:17 Like you could gain so many subscribers and they all are like me included.
01:13:21 And we're like, oh, what a shame.
01:13:26 Can you do that thing?
01:13:26 You thought you'd found a big well of new content and then you dive into it and you're like,
01:13:32 like maybe he may in the future do.
01:13:34 I mean, he's talked about doing another one.
01:13:37 It'll probably be like four years or something.
01:13:39 And then, oh, there it is.
01:13:40 I don't want to watch these videos in the meantime though.
01:13:43 But you know, I guess he has to make money.
01:13:44 I just, you know, that's probably how most people feel about my channel
01:13:48 and how it's got the two lectures that they like.
01:13:50 And then all of a sudden like Pokemon Nuzlocke bullshit.
01:13:53 Yeah, I imagine someone makes these incredible life changing anime reviews.
01:13:58 Then they just churn out these shitty vlogs every week.
01:14:01 I mean, geez, what a disappointment that would be.
01:14:02 I mean, I get the feeling because I feel that way about Ahoy
01:14:07 and I'm sure people feel that way about me.
01:14:09 And I don't know, what are you going to do?
01:14:10 Yeah, yeah, what are you going to find out?
01:14:14 That's all.
01:14:15 You separate your content, separate the content into different channels
01:14:19 so people can subscribe to one or the other.
01:14:21 But YouTube doesn't like you to do that.
01:14:23 So they punish you for doing it.
01:14:25 Yeah, they sure do.
01:14:27 Yeah, I don't know.
01:14:28 I mean, what good does it even do to have a channel?
01:14:30 I mean, I guess it's easy.
01:14:32 But like if you have it, let's say you have a channel where you just post
01:14:34 like these amazing walk across the world videos and everybody loves them.
01:14:37 But you only post once every year, maybe?
01:14:41 I don't know.
01:14:42 Is that good?
01:14:43 Is that better?
01:14:44 I don't know.
01:14:45 It's obviously not better for him as like a business.
01:14:46 He, you know, reaps an audience.
01:14:48 I mean, people are very, very used to a content creator existing only
01:14:54 if they upload every day.
01:14:56 And if they don't upload every day, the people forget that they exist.
01:15:00 And they're like, oh my god, you're alive?
01:15:02 Like, lol, that was a joke a while back.
01:15:05 People still say that.
01:15:07 They do.
01:15:08 And it's, I mean, it's what they really feel.
01:15:10 Like you basically are dead to them if you stop posting for more than like two weeks.
01:15:14 And I've always, I've ever since like this happened to Igoraptor way back where like
01:15:19 animations were taking a long time to come out.
01:15:22 People would go to his like comment section, like on his channel
01:15:25 and just complain that he wasn't uploading frequently enough and they would unsubscribe.
01:15:29 And I never understood-
01:15:30 Oh, how we paid for that mistake.
01:15:31 I never understood the, like the problem there because if you're subscribed to something,
01:15:38 it's not like that you're paying money.
01:15:41 It's not like you're doing anything.
01:15:42 You just said, I'd like to see the next thing that comes out.
01:15:45 And if it takes a while to come out, then you'll be notified for it later.
01:15:50 Then you would maybe hope.
01:15:52 But like, why would you unsubscribe?
01:15:53 They put in the hard work of clicking subscribe because it's not putting out content fast enough.
01:16:00 But if the, yeah, but if the content that it is putting out, even if it's infrequent,
01:16:04 like if it's still stuff you like, you don't lose anything by being subscribed to a channel.
01:16:10 I mean, I don't think people do that anymore.
01:16:14 But like the way YouTube works now, it definitely plays into that because
01:16:19 you're just, you're just nothing.
01:16:20 You're nothing.
01:16:21 You have no money if you don't post every single second.
01:16:23 Yeah, you gotta, I mean, you should be posting daily.
01:16:27 Everybody should be.
01:16:28 Like that's the ideal way to do it, which is disgusting.
01:16:32 But what are you going to do?
01:16:33 I put a one second video every day of like-
01:16:36 You just, you just got to like make an update video every day.
01:16:39 Just you basically just have to become like a life blogger.
01:16:42 Just be like, yeah, I'm just going to vlog my entire-
01:16:44 All right, here's my new project.
01:16:46 I'm going to record-
01:16:48 You have to be a new storyteller.
01:16:50 I have to, I'm going to record a 365 second long video.
01:16:54 Oh yeah.
01:16:55 And every day for one second of that video will be uploaded.
01:16:59 That's a good idea.
01:17:00 You know, literally you should make a new channel and do that and like see how it does,
01:17:04 you know, like see if people are interested in-
01:17:06 What if it just algorithmically crushes?
01:17:08 Like who knows?
01:17:10 It could, it could.
01:17:10 There are other things that don't seem like they're going to be-
01:17:12 I mean, there's no watch time because like I'm not going to get anything from it.
01:17:16 I guess that's true.
01:17:17 I guess that's true.
01:17:18 Like 17 million videos and a one second video is like-
01:17:20 You'll just, you'll just please the algorithm.
01:17:22 It'll just be like, it'll just be like a sun offering-
01:17:24 Please just punch.
01:17:25 The algorithm to favor you.
01:17:26 Just think about this.
01:17:27 What if before, forget the watch time.
01:17:30 What if before all those watches, if it gets a lot, you, you have just one ad,
01:17:34 you know, just one ad before it.
01:17:36 Financially, I mean, it could do well.
01:17:38 It posts every day.
01:17:38 You have like a 15 second ad before each of your one second videos.
01:17:43 Exactly, exactly.
01:17:45 Why not?
01:17:45 Why not?
01:17:46 And an ad afterward.
01:17:47 Yeah, and then no, you have a one second of the video and you go,
01:17:50 hey guys, thanks for watching.
01:17:51 This video is sponsored by Skillshare.
01:17:55 It'd just be like, hey guys, thanks for watching.
01:18:03 Oh, I mean, it's a really funny idea.
01:18:05 I wish someone would do it.
01:18:07 If, if not you-
01:18:08 I mean, I may as well.
01:18:09 Why not?
01:18:10 Like who gives a shit?
01:18:11 Yeah, you should.
01:18:13 Take a day and schedule them all.
01:18:14 Put them up on, I don't know, some, some monetized channel.
01:18:16 I'll just put it up on Gibbentake.
01:18:18 Oh, actually, that's not, that's-
01:18:19 Gibbentake 2020.
01:18:20 Gibbentake is like completely demonetized forever,
01:18:23 so I can't do anything on there.
01:18:25 What?
01:18:25 Yeah.
01:18:26 Why?
01:18:26 Why is that?
01:18:27 I don't know.
01:18:27 I, I appealed it twice and just said no.
01:18:30 So like, I don't know why.
01:18:31 Obviously they didn't tell me.
01:18:32 I think I've explained this on the PCB before.
01:18:34 It's got it.
01:18:35 It's just sort of like fucked.
01:18:36 So I can't put it on there.
01:18:37 Maybe it's like-
01:18:38 They really didn't like your My Little Pipe.
01:18:40 Yeah, that's probably it really.
01:18:41 It's just like-
01:18:42 Clopping is not okay, Gibb, and you need to learn.
01:18:44 Oh, no, you're right.
01:18:46 Whoops.
01:18:47 That's not family-friendly content.
01:18:49 I do, I do have a few videos where I say fuck.
01:18:53 At, even in the title.
01:18:54 Are you crazy?
01:18:57 Including this one where I just said fuck.
01:18:58 I don't, I don't, I don't pretend.
01:19:02 I don't pretend to understand how the algorithm works.
01:19:06 It's beyond me.
01:19:07 Me either.
01:19:08 It's praise be.
01:19:10 All right.
01:19:11 Bullshit meta art piece YouTube things.
01:19:17 I remember Jay Bauman had a YouTube channel,
01:19:20 or still does under his name.
01:19:23 All the thumbnails and titles are him talking about something or other.
01:19:27 But then the content of the video is just a static shot of a candle and a book.
01:19:35 It's just they're completely out of order,
01:19:37 all these different puzzle piece videos.
01:19:39 You click on a new one,
01:19:41 you think it's going to be Jay Bauman talking about something.
01:19:44 And it's no, it's more footage of the candle flickering
01:19:48 and the wax melting slowly for like 20 minutes.
01:19:53 And there's nothing, I don't get it, but it's cool.
01:19:57 It's-
01:19:57 Is it the thumbnails?
01:19:58 Are the thumbnails a joke of some kind, perhaps?
01:20:00 Well, I think the joke is that you think that this is just some sort of stupid video bullshit thing.
01:20:07 And it's even funnier than that.
01:20:10 It's nothing.
01:20:11 It's just nothing.
01:20:14 Perfect.
01:20:15 It's just what I want.
01:20:16 Imagine that.
01:20:17 Yeah, it's kind of cool.
01:20:18 I remember looking at that and wondering what the heck the deal was, but it's good.
01:20:24 Just his sense of humor.
01:20:25 All right.
01:20:27 Well, we could just get to the voicemails now if you want.
01:20:29 I have something I want to bring up, but it is in the voicemails,
01:20:32 so we will get to it inevitably in time.
01:20:34 Wasn't there- Tom, didn't you have something that happened?
01:20:38 He did, Ben, but that's within the voicemail.
01:20:40 It's the same thing I wanted to discuss, and we will get-
01:20:42 I will say that I'm working on DevTober.
01:20:44 It's going great.
01:20:45 I posted a video showing the work in progress of the boss fight.
01:20:48 It's great.
01:20:50 Give me money so I can keep making the game.
01:20:52 I also added a new thing to my Patreon yesterday where I'm going to have rants for a dollar.
01:20:57 So you can listen to me rant about shit for a dollar.
01:20:59 Wow.
01:21:00 You know, I also, incidentally, added something similar to mine,
01:21:03 which is just if people pay five dollars in my monthly video or whatever,
01:21:07 if you're at the $10 one, then I will also just answer whatever fucking question you want.
01:21:11 So there you go.
01:21:11 We were both had the similar of one month.
01:21:14 So I have the $5 podcast where people can request topics for podcasts,
01:21:18 and then for $1 you get rants, which nobody gives me questions for.
01:21:22 I just do it whenever I get mad at something.
01:21:24 Because I'm too much of a bitch to put them on Twitter and get the blowback.
01:21:27 I don't want to deal with it.
01:21:28 So I just put them on Patreon instead.
01:21:30 Yeah, makes sense.
01:21:32 It's great.
01:21:33 So, yeah.
01:21:34 Those people are already invested in that.
01:21:36 Those people will give you the benefit of the doubt.
01:21:38 Exactly.
01:21:39 I can have a conversation with people who don't want me to die.
01:21:43 In fact, they want me to live.
01:21:44 Hence, they give me money.
01:21:45 Rare, rare privilege.
01:21:48 Indeed.
01:21:49 Indeed.
01:21:49 I have also been doing monthtober,
01:21:53 which is where you do something every day for a month during October.
01:21:59 So I've been drawing.
01:22:02 It's the same as last month, basically.
01:22:05 Yeah, it's doing the draw streams and stuff.
01:22:08 Are you still doing the streams daily?
01:22:12 Is that still a daily thing?
01:22:13 Yeah, every weekday I do a stream to a wrapped audience of seven.
01:22:20 And that's pretty cool.
01:22:21 Well, I mean, the end result is these noir red man comics, which...
01:22:28 Boy, I've got fucking excited when I saw those.
01:22:30 I saw those on your Twitter.
01:22:31 I was like, oh my...
01:22:32 Okay.
01:22:32 Yeah.
01:22:33 You're going to make more?
01:22:34 You're going to make more?
01:22:35 I'm going to maybe make one tonight.
01:22:37 Because I haven't thought of an idea for today what I'm going to draw,
01:22:42 but the more red man is good.
01:22:44 I'm going to be...
01:22:47 I'll probably continue streaming myself drawing more of the Phantom Horn comic,
01:22:53 because that's pretty good.
01:22:54 I think people like that.
01:22:57 Pretty epic.
01:22:59 Pretty epic.
01:23:01 Maybe I'll get trolled some more.
01:23:03 You never know.
01:23:06 God, I hope so.
01:23:07 God, I wish that were me.
01:23:09 All right.
01:23:10 Well, let's do it.
01:23:10 Let's go to the voicemails.
01:23:12 We got them right here.
01:23:13 Speakpipe, people, link down below.
01:23:16 Speakpipe, link, whatever.
01:23:17 Leave us voicemails.
01:23:18 And I've got to say, so we're getting there a little bit early today,
01:23:21 because there's just a fucking bunch of them.
01:23:23 And they've been of higher quality, and they are good, and I enjoy them.
01:23:27 I'll be the judge of that.
01:23:27 So we'll spend a little longer.
01:23:29 Yeah, well, you can let me know if that's true or not.
01:23:32 Oh, I think there was one.
01:23:34 This is like the classic pre-real start of the voicemails.
01:23:40 This is just kind of a life update one.
01:23:42 So let's see what the PCP Shadow Puppet Master has for us today.
01:23:48 All right, get to it.
01:23:49 Go.
01:23:50 Okay.
01:23:51 Okay.
01:23:53 Secretly, I am the PCP Shadow Puppet Master.
01:24:00 You may not realize it.
01:24:02 I might sound familiar, but here's the thing.
01:24:06 I originally submitted a voicemail a few weeks back, calling for more voicemails.
01:24:14 And what happens?
01:24:16 That's not true.
01:24:16 More voicemails come in.
01:24:18 That's kind of strange coincidence.
01:24:20 It might I say the quality of them has been higher.
01:24:25 I knew you could do it, PCP audience.
01:24:28 I am grateful for you because I too have submitted many fucking voicemails that have
01:24:36 all gotten in.
01:24:38 Okay.
01:24:40 This is what is up.
01:24:43 If you guys have noticed that quality increase of voicemails,
01:24:47 you might want to thank me, PCP Shadow Puppet.
01:24:51 Master.
01:24:53 Well, there you go.
01:24:54 Like I said, thanks for all the voicemails.
01:24:56 My dude, you did.
01:24:58 I don't know if he's the PCP Puppet Master.
01:25:00 He's more like the voicemail.
01:25:02 He's the PCP audience master pulling their strings and yanking their chain.
01:25:06 Pulling the strings that connect to his own arms and legs.
01:25:14 And their vocal cords to elicit dulcet tones for us to respond to here.
01:25:18 Let's thank you Shadow Master.
01:25:20 Let's get the next one.
01:25:21 Yeah.
01:25:22 Here we go.
01:25:22 Next one is from BradoSanDakoku.
01:25:27 Okay.
01:25:27 Great.
01:25:28 Go.
01:25:29 Like what the hell bros?
01:25:31 So like there's this chick, right?
01:25:32 And I said that she was fat, but I still fuck her.
01:25:37 Right?
01:25:38 I'm like, she got some piss at me.
01:25:41 Like what the hell is her problem, bros?
01:25:45 I need some opinions on this, especially of mages on.
01:25:48 Like is this a compliment or an insult?
01:25:52 I mean, I'm pretty sure it was a compliment.
01:25:56 Yeah, no, no, for sure.
01:25:57 It's a very, no, it's a very funny insult.
01:25:59 And I think you should continue to do it.
01:26:03 It's yielding results already.
01:26:04 So just stay the course I say.
01:26:06 We got a great voicemail out of it.
01:26:07 So we all had a lot of laughs.
01:26:10 Keep it up.
01:26:10 Keep up the good work, my dude.
01:26:13 Yeah.
01:26:13 I have no further commentary.
01:26:14 I'm gonna stay the course.
01:26:16 The problem is clearly with the children, not with you.
01:26:18 No, it's the children that are wrong.
01:26:23 Well, there you go.
01:26:24 That's all there is to it.
01:26:25 Excellent work.
01:26:25 This is great, by the way.
01:26:28 These are great.
01:26:29 Okay, no, no.
01:26:30 Get ready for this.
01:26:30 Get ready for this.
01:26:31 Because we've got an actual five-star chef,
01:26:34 not a joke on why we're all wrong culling in.
01:26:37 So, okay, let's hear it.
01:26:39 Sweetest chef.
01:26:40 Okay, what's up?
01:26:41 I'm a real actual five-star chef.
01:26:43 I've worked in a couple of famous hotels,
01:26:45 like the Jefferson and Richmond, Virginia,
01:26:47 and the Omni in Charlottesville.
01:26:49 I'm a culinary school grad,
01:26:50 and while I was there,
01:26:51 I cooked with a bunch of celebrity chefs,
01:26:54 including Guy Fieri, oddly enough.
01:26:56 Jesus Christ.
01:26:57 I'm here to settle the score on Hello Fresh.
01:26:59 Here's it.
01:27:01 Here's it in a nutshell.
01:27:02 Ben is both correct and a massive retard.
01:27:05 Nate is just a retard.
01:27:06 Munchy is a little baby boy,
01:27:08 so he gets a pass, but he's wrong.
01:27:10 I made it at the best.
01:27:10 What I think Ben is trying to say
01:27:13 is that the biggest problem with Hello Fresh
01:27:15 and those Amazon ready meals or whatever they're called
01:27:18 is that they teach you recipes and not techniques.
01:27:21 And in order to be a good cook,
01:27:23 recipes are literally not worth the paper they're printed on
01:27:27 because they don't teach you things like knife skills,
01:27:29 searing, sauteing, blanching, flavor bases,
01:27:32 how to season things properly.
01:27:35 So here's the difference between you and me.
01:27:37 We could both be given one of those ready meals
01:27:39 with the same instructions,
01:27:41 the same pots, pans, and stove to cook it on,
01:27:43 and mine will come out better 100% of the time.
01:27:47 And that is because I know these foundational things.
01:27:50 So if you want to learn those,
01:27:52 you need to check out Tim Ferriss as the four-hour chef.
01:27:55 Tim Ferriss is a guy who wanted to be a post-food boy
01:27:58 and hated cooking and decided the best way to do that
01:28:01 was to master cooking.
01:28:02 So it's written for people exactly like you.
01:28:05 So yeah, learn some techniques.
01:28:08 Peace.
01:28:09 Sounds really cool.
01:28:11 And that was a quality voicemail.
01:28:13 Yeah.
01:28:14 Now that's what I'm talking about.
01:28:16 It's almost like when someone has experience,
01:28:18 they can speak on a subject with some sense of intelligence.
01:28:21 I'll put that...
01:28:22 It's very rare on these parts.
01:28:23 I'll put that guy in a voicemail for dropping genuine...
01:28:26 Any of voicemail?
01:28:28 Am I crazy?
01:28:28 Oh, come on.
01:28:29 I didn't even get one giggle, one goofle out of that.
01:28:33 I learned...
01:28:34 But I gained knowledge.
01:28:36 I gained...
01:28:36 We didn't do the category.
01:28:37 It's the voice braille.
01:28:38 It's not the voice comedy award.
01:28:42 I disagree with the distinction.
01:28:46 The distinction without a difference.
01:28:48 I definitely agree with him, by the way.
01:28:50 From my dad, I've learned a lot of cooking techniques.
01:28:54 And so I know what you're supposed to do with steaks
01:28:57 and when you're frying and how to do this and that,
01:29:00 and how to chop onions properly.
01:29:03 But I don't know any recipes at all.
01:29:05 But when I Google something, it works out.
01:29:07 So...
01:29:09 That's all you need.
01:29:10 Now, okay.
01:29:11 Sure.
01:29:11 See, I agree with his point.
01:29:14 But I will say, I will say,
01:29:16 that I think he's coming from a different perspective.
01:29:19 Yeah, a perspective of knowledge, as opposed to ignorance.
01:29:22 Okay, because here's who I am.
01:29:24 Here's who I am.
01:29:24 I'm a poor orphan boy on the side of the road saying,
01:29:27 Papa, please, sir.
01:29:29 I need something that tastes at least kind of decent.
01:29:33 I'm dying of hunger.
01:29:34 I don't know what I'm doing.
01:29:35 Why is like a ready...
01:29:38 They were literally free.
01:29:39 They were literally free.
01:29:40 They did not pay for it.
01:29:41 Well, this is important.
01:29:42 That is important for you.
01:29:43 That makes all the difference.
01:29:44 The voicemail guy did direct you to a book thing that would...
01:29:48 A resource that I'm sure you have.
01:29:50 That is from your perspective of a guy who wants to be post-food.
01:29:53 Intellectual elite, five-star chef coming on and saying,
01:29:57 like, Nate, you need to go to school for five, 10,000 years
01:30:01 before you can cook a meal.
01:30:02 That's not what he said.
01:30:03 So just die of hunger, Nate.
01:30:04 He said, read a book by Tim Ferriss.
01:30:06 Just die of hunger, Nate.
01:30:07 I'm hungry now.
01:30:09 No eating until you read this book.
01:30:09 I'm going to McDonald's.
01:30:12 And that's final.
01:30:13 I'm getting a Big Mac.
01:30:14 He also said you're a retard and you're proving it right now.
01:30:17 You keep getting McDonald's.
01:30:18 I'm going to have to kill you one of these days.
01:30:22 I'm just...
01:30:22 No, I'm for McDonald's.
01:30:25 I'm pro McDonald's.
01:30:27 McDonald's is one of the better.
01:30:27 McDonald's isn't even keto.
01:30:29 It is if you do it like me.
01:30:31 Dude, $3 for two McDoubles.
01:30:33 You just take the buns off.
01:30:35 And it's four beef patties for $3 and you just eat them.
01:30:38 And it's great.
01:30:39 It seems...
01:30:40 It's great.
01:30:40 Are they, like, good, though?
01:30:41 Yeah.
01:30:42 Like, those patties are kind of...
01:30:43 Honestly, I highly recommend it.
01:30:45 It's keto, keto, bonito.
01:30:46 Bringing it back to the first thing I said.
01:30:48 Bring it all the way back to the beginning.
01:30:49 All right, we're ending the podcast right here.
01:30:51 Good night, everybody.
01:30:53 All right, what's next?
01:30:54 Oh, oh, you know what?
01:30:55 There was another call from the five-star chef.
01:30:58 Now, I thought he was good.
01:30:59 I'm tempted to just skip it because it's...
01:31:02 Okay, it's the five-star chef one last time on why I subsist on...
01:31:06 Why I subsist Huell, which I think was a typo.
01:31:09 I think he meant, like, resist or something.
01:31:11 And I'm afraid this will bring his average quality of voicemail down.
01:31:14 But, okay, now I have to play it.
01:31:16 Yeah, I want to hear it.
01:31:17 I want to hear what he has to say.
01:31:18 All right, let's hear what he has to say.
01:31:19 Here's the second one.
01:31:20 Beware of the tipping point of cooking.
01:31:23 Once you reach it, you will never be able to eat out again.
01:31:27 Because even if the food tastes good,
01:31:28 you will always know that it could be better.
01:31:33 And as a result, it ruins the experience.
01:31:36 This is why it's a great way to become a post-food boy, however.
01:31:40 So, this is...
01:31:42 And another reason to bother to learn it
01:31:45 is when it comes to impressing dates, you're done.
01:31:51 You're set.
01:31:52 That's true.
01:31:52 Impressing your significant other.
01:31:54 You never have to buy a birthday present ever again.
01:31:57 You just make them standing rip roast with some fucking mashed potatoes
01:32:01 or some other shit like that.
01:32:03 Bitches love that shit.
01:32:05 Some rice pilaf and some salmon.
01:32:08 There you go.
01:32:10 You're never obligated to buy a present
01:32:12 or pay for an expensive dinner.
01:32:13 Literally ever again.
01:32:15 Well, I don't know about all that.
01:32:17 Bitches still want that diamond, that rock.
01:32:20 Just put a gold bar in the pie.
01:32:23 Yeah.
01:32:25 I love this idea of the best way to...
01:32:29 Like, if you hate cooking, if you want to be post-food,
01:32:33 you must acquire the knowledge necessary to defeat it.
01:32:37 I don't understand this point.
01:32:39 I love this.
01:32:40 What am I missing here?
01:32:41 It's like to be a post-food boy, you learn and you cook.
01:32:44 Because if you can't cook for yourself, then you are a slave.
01:32:49 You are a slave to others' ability to feed you, right?
01:32:53 To cook for you.
01:32:54 I think the difference here is that...
01:32:55 You no longer depend on others.
01:32:57 The more you understand food, the more freedom you have.
01:33:03 The more leeway you have in how much control...
01:33:05 Once you become a fucking elitist about it,
01:33:07 you're not just going to go down to McDonald's
01:33:09 and get your two McDoubles and just eat the four patties.
01:33:12 Because you're going to look at those patties
01:33:13 and see how disgusting they are compared to what you could do
01:33:15 with your own two hands.
01:33:16 So you'll get higher quality ingredients.
01:33:18 No, that will always be great value.
01:33:22 Value is one thing.
01:33:24 Quality is another thing in time.
01:33:25 Value is eternal.
01:33:26 Value is undeniable.
01:33:29 All right.
01:33:31 That sounds very capitalist of you, Ben.
01:33:33 I really feel like you could get an equivalent amount of meat
01:33:37 for less than going to McDonald's for it.
01:33:42 What's less?
01:33:42 You're saying that McDonald's is not valuable?
01:33:44 The four, whatever you said.
01:33:47 Two McDoubles for $3.
01:33:48 I feel like you could find an equivalent amount of meat
01:33:52 like of an equivalent.
01:33:54 I go to Walmart and I get 20 patties for $8.
01:33:57 So I'm pretty sure that's...
01:33:58 That's pretty good.
01:33:59 ...that balances out much better.
01:34:00 Okay, I defy anyone to find a better keto deal than two McDoubles
01:34:08 for $3. Throw the patties away.
01:34:09 You just buy the meat from a butcher's.
01:34:11 I just said 20 for $8.
01:34:14 You buy the meat from a butcher's?
01:34:14 20 for the patties for $8.
01:34:16 But it's pre-cooked.
01:34:17 You don't have to cook it.
01:34:19 Okay, but we're talking...
01:34:20 That's part of the value you want to offer here
01:34:23 is that you don't have to prepare it.
01:34:24 Yeah.
01:34:25 Is that you just get it.
01:34:25 I suppose that's true.
01:34:26 I mean, okay.
01:34:29 If I have to get in my car, drive down to McDonald's, order the food,
01:34:34 spend the gas, take them apart and put them back together
01:34:38 versus buy them once and then just throw them in a pan.
01:34:41 Well, I'm with you in making the trip as a nightmare.
01:34:45 I feel like the scale at some point starts to balance in my favor.
01:34:50 Well, you know, we're not...
01:34:51 You're on the road and you're just McDonald's right now.
01:34:52 You just buy a cow and then you cut it in half
01:34:55 and then the other half grows back
01:34:57 and you can get another cow again.
01:34:59 You can do this all day and day.
01:35:00 Just take a bite out of your arm.
01:35:02 It'll grow back eventually.
01:35:04 All right, let's move on.
01:35:05 We've got a thank you five-star chef.
01:35:07 Are we putting them in the voice grail?
01:35:08 Put them in the voice kitchen.
01:35:11 Yeah, that's there.
01:35:12 There you go.
01:35:13 That's where he belongs.
01:35:14 Your honorary PCP cook.
01:35:16 All right, we got...
01:35:17 Where we can extract the most value from him.
01:35:20 Jade Murrow sounding dumb is the title of this.
01:35:24 I know.
01:35:24 Okay, Jade.
01:35:25 All right, Jade.
01:35:25 Sorry I haven't given you that script yet.
01:35:29 One of these days.
01:35:30 All right, go.
01:35:31 Seeing as you all are different ages,
01:35:34 how do you think you all would get along
01:35:35 in a timeline where you're all your 20-year-old selves?
01:35:40 Now, I thought this was an interesting question
01:35:42 because we have to age up, munchy,
01:35:44 and age down most of us and see like,
01:35:46 what's that going to be like?
01:35:48 What was I like at 20, you know?
01:35:50 We wouldn't get along...
01:35:51 Me and munchy wouldn't get along
01:35:52 because I would be dumber and he would be smarter
01:35:55 and then we wouldn't be on equal intellectual footing.
01:36:01 I mean, I was like...
01:36:03 I mean, this is before Nate's journey to the East,
01:36:06 you know, the famous story.
01:36:07 So, I was still a little bitch boy.
01:36:10 I mean, well, I was 20...
01:36:11 This is an incredibly difficult question
01:36:12 because you're talking about changing our ages,
01:36:15 but like, it's also like,
01:36:16 are we going back to like what we were at the time
01:36:18 or are we in present time now?
01:36:20 This is like, what if we are all of our 20-year-old selves?
01:36:24 Because we all have different levels of experience
01:36:28 at that age.
01:36:29 So, it's difficult to say.
01:36:31 I mean, I think munchy would just be bored all of us.
01:36:33 If we all grew up at the same time,
01:36:36 we would all probably be on similar levels
01:36:38 in terms of like cultural and like just ideas
01:36:41 because like we've all come to the same conclusions
01:36:43 as the culture has...
01:36:45 A 20-year-old munchy will still be in college.
01:36:47 He'll still be a nascent pupa of a nothing boy.
01:36:50 But he's done so much more than I did at 20.
01:36:53 He's done all these internet things that we've now done.
01:36:54 Right, but the reason he's done more things at 20
01:36:56 is because when we were 20,
01:36:58 all this stuff was just starting to emerge.
01:37:00 But I think we...
01:37:01 I think it's still fair to like give munchy that up
01:37:04 just because like it's...
01:37:06 He just started earlier than us.
01:37:07 He just did better earlier in life.
01:37:08 Right, he started earlier because the culture allowed you
01:37:10 to start earlier, became more of an accepted thing.
01:37:12 There is that aspect, but not everybody who is munchy's age
01:37:16 is like munchy.
01:37:18 So like munchy is exceptional even among his age bracket.
01:37:21 The thing that ties us all together right now
01:37:23 is that we all have similar value structures.
01:37:27 So if we were all the same age,
01:37:28 I feel like we all would still be pursuing
01:37:30 the same kind of things because those are reflective
01:37:32 of our values combined with our modern experience.
01:37:34 When I was 20, I thought I was going to go on
01:37:37 to get my like PhD in physics and become like a scientist.
01:37:41 I thought that was going to be like or become a professor,
01:37:44 I think was what I wanted.
01:37:46 But then it was as like the world continues,
01:37:48 like as things happen to you, right?
01:37:51 And you experience new things.
01:37:52 And look at me now, falling.
01:37:52 And that changed you into who you are today.
01:37:54 Yeah.
01:37:55 So like, I don't know.
01:37:58 Yeah, yeah, it's complicated.
01:38:00 We get it, old man.
01:38:01 You're just trying to justify your decrepit body and soul.
01:38:06 I mean, yes, I guess, sure.
01:38:10 I'll cop to that.
01:38:11 Hey, well, how is the, what are you saying?
01:38:13 Like, how is that an argument against?
01:38:14 I mean, Tom's point is making a fair point that like we,
01:38:19 Munchie has had many advantages by simply existing
01:38:22 later in time than we would have had slightly earlier
01:38:24 because the development of, you know,
01:38:26 things like YouTube online businesses,
01:38:28 I mean, a 20 Patreon didn't exist.
01:38:29 What would the fuck would we have all been doing,
01:38:31 you know, without Patreon?
01:38:33 And Munchie will have that at 20.
01:38:34 That's okay.
01:38:35 According to my YouTube channel at 20,
01:38:39 I was like getting tired of the compilations
01:38:42 and I was thinking about making a pony analysis channel.
01:38:45 Okay.
01:38:46 So that's where I was.
01:38:48 Interesting.
01:38:49 Sad.
01:38:49 I was, I was a nothing man.
01:38:51 I was the nowhere man of being the same.
01:38:52 I was still in college and I was sad
01:38:55 and I was making comics and trying to get them self-published
01:38:58 and trying to, making my huge mistake
01:39:01 of networking with terrible people
01:39:03 and they're dragging me down.
01:39:05 And I swore off humans for like three years after that
01:39:07 until I got into MLP and realized that friendship was magic.
01:39:11 Oh, ironically, what happened?
01:39:15 Cramp.
01:39:15 Cramp.
01:39:16 Okay, it's fine.
01:39:18 No, don't worry about it.
01:39:19 All right.
01:39:20 Speaking of decrepit old man bodies,
01:39:22 a mere laugh drives back to the ground.
01:39:24 Can I tell you, I have a story about my decrepit old man body.
01:39:26 I've been feeling, I've been having, I've been suffering.
01:39:31 I've been just waking up or like, just like,
01:39:33 my back's been hurting, right?
01:39:34 I've just been like, and like, there's nothing I can do.
01:39:36 Like, no matter how I sit, it doesn't help.
01:39:38 I can lie down, it doesn't help.
01:39:40 It sucks.
01:39:41 And exercise help with this?
01:39:42 Not really.
01:39:43 I hate to tell you, but that's how my back problem started
01:39:45 and I'm getting surgery in two weeks.
01:39:47 Well, I mean, I discovered, well, I mean, who?
01:39:50 Yesterday, I discovered that like, it actually helps
01:39:55 if I just fucking like, jam my knuckles into my back
01:39:58 and just like roll it around.
01:39:58 That's probably a massage.
01:40:00 Yeah.
01:40:00 And I, yeah, I've spent my entire life
01:40:02 saying that massage is fake and a scam.
01:40:06 And so now, so now I found the solution
01:40:07 but I can't use it on principle.
01:40:11 Yeah, that's fair.
01:40:12 I've been thinking of going to a massage parlor,
01:40:15 just the idea of like, you know, seeing what it's like.
01:40:19 And then.
01:40:19 No, massage is fantastic.
01:40:21 I swear by it.
01:40:22 I don't do it nearly enough because I can't anymore
01:40:24 because if I lie down on my back for more than two minutes,
01:40:26 it breaks in half.
01:40:26 But before that, it was fantastic.
01:40:29 Huh.
01:40:30 I mean.
01:40:30 Interesting.
01:40:30 You know, when I was at Dom, maybe there's a little something to it.
01:40:34 At my, at my last job, you know, my programming job,
01:40:36 actually like once a year or so, fairly, there was like these
01:40:40 every week, there would be like on Wednesday,
01:40:42 there'd be like a get little take a break.
01:40:45 Everybody hang out and kind of like chill for a few minutes.
01:40:47 But, but really, you guys can get back to work.
01:40:49 You got things to do.
01:40:50 But as part of that, once every like six months or year or something,
01:40:55 they have like a masseuse in the area,
01:40:58 come to the place and give like little like 10 minute
01:41:02 promo massages of like what she could do at like her actual boutique.
01:41:07 So she would just come in and do like free massages.
01:41:09 She probably got paid by like the company or something.
01:41:11 But as a result, every once in a while,
01:41:13 you could just sign up for like a free short massage at my job.
01:41:18 And pretty, pretty, pretty sick.
01:41:20 Man, what'd you leave?
01:41:21 It's good.
01:41:22 I can't, I don't know.
01:41:24 Cause I'm an idiot.
01:41:26 You had it all.
01:41:26 He threw it away.
01:41:28 It was a, I mean, like I said,
01:41:29 I could have done that job the rest of my life
01:41:31 and been pretty happy.
01:41:32 And maybe I will when things don't go well on YouTube.
01:41:35 We'll see.
01:41:36 You know, when Ghost in the Shell finally comes out
01:41:38 and everybody turns up in here.
01:41:39 And nobody likes it.
01:41:39 Yeah.
01:41:39 Oops.
01:41:40 Well, there I go.
01:41:41 I'm the Ghost in the Shell of my YouTube career.
01:41:44 Oh, don't you know that show is made by white supremacists though?
01:41:48 And you're like, ah, damn.
01:41:49 Is that true?
01:41:50 Probably, right?
01:41:51 Statistically, it's likely.
01:41:52 I can't wait for next year, April, 2020,
01:41:54 when Ghost in the Shell finally comes out
01:41:56 and it's an April Fool's joke
01:41:57 and it's just Scarlett Johansson movie review.
01:42:00 And you prank everybody and everyone mass on subscribes.
01:42:02 Oh, would that be epic?
01:42:05 All right.
01:42:05 Let's, let's move on to our next question here.
01:42:07 Erdek's call.
01:42:08 This is from Autism Quantified.
01:42:11 And I think it's a little quiet.
01:42:12 Oh, Digi's calling him.
01:42:14 Yeah, indeed, indeed.
01:42:16 All right.
01:42:16 Let's, let's go here.
01:42:17 I heard there's a new way of categorizing autism.
01:42:21 My therapist cocks an eyebrow.
01:42:23 He says that I seem like a well-adjusted guy
01:42:24 and that there's surely nothing to worry about.
01:42:27 I respond that I like to make sure.
01:42:29 She nods and asks what kind of media I typically consume.
01:42:32 The usual, I say, I read and I'm quite partial to anime.
01:42:36 Her brow furrows.
01:42:37 The answer clearly concerns her.
01:42:39 She writes plus one on her notebook.
01:42:41 My neurotical divergence increases by six
01:42:43 and my communication stat plummets.
01:42:46 Do you have any hobbies like sports or languages?
01:42:50 Yeah, I'm learning a language.
01:42:51 Her face lights up.
01:42:53 Japanese, I add.
01:42:55 She winces and increases my score by one.
01:42:58 Conventional, I think, is increased by minus eight to three.
01:43:02 I also write fanfiction.
01:43:04 She skips straight to four.
01:43:05 My alcohol tolerance and degeneracy increase dramatically.
01:43:09 Two adder all appear in my inventory.
01:43:11 Oh, and I write for a dating son.
01:43:14 She seems more scared than anything now
01:43:16 than I'm on the notebook reads six.
01:43:19 I gain the ability to communicate through Pepe's
01:43:21 and lose the ability to communicate in any other way.
01:43:24 I elaborate that in the dating son,
01:43:26 you romance a group of niche account artists called the PCP.
01:43:30 She stutters that she doesn't know what comes after seven.
01:43:35 As I take the notebook, she gulps.
01:43:37 I write the number eight and rotate it by 90 degrees.
01:43:41 We both die instantly.
01:43:47 A happy ending.
01:43:48 Fuck, what was the last thing you said?
01:43:49 I missed it.
01:43:50 I think I should, like, everyone dies or we both combust or they die
01:43:54 is the implication.
01:43:55 Great.
01:43:56 Great storytelling on our own.
01:43:58 PCP is infinite autism.
01:43:59 That's pretty funny.
01:44:01 That was that was a great creepypasta voicemail.
01:44:03 Didn't see it coming.
01:44:05 The twist.
01:44:06 It literally sounds like Creeps McPasta
01:44:08 who does creepypasta narration, so.
01:44:10 I did that joke.
01:44:11 Great job, dude.
01:44:12 Sorry for you and your therapist lost, my dude.
01:44:16 Yikes, big yikes, big oof, effin' chat.
01:44:21 We'll see you next week.
01:44:22 See you right.
01:44:26 Next voicemail.
01:44:27 This is from, wait, what is this?
01:44:29 What is, I think I linked the wrong one away.
01:44:31 Let me get this again.
01:44:32 Oh my god.
01:44:33 Okay, it's One Piece and Munchy Extravaganza.
01:44:37 Okay, let me re-type this, play, and okay, go.
01:44:42 So hello, PCP.
01:44:43 I have a story to tell.
01:44:45 So one of my friends is retarded, okay?
01:44:50 He says that he does not like One Piece at all
01:44:53 because there's nothing going on in either manga or the anime, right?
01:44:58 Oh, okay, I see.
01:44:59 He's saying like the Luffy character,
01:45:02 he was supposed to become the pirate king, right?
01:45:06 But he's still not a fucking pirate king,
01:45:09 even though it was a billion years, right?
01:45:12 And I know that he's wrong because you guys are right, right?
01:45:16 That's right.
01:45:17 But I don't know why he's wrong.
01:45:19 Like, what is really going on in One Piece?
01:45:23 Well, do you read it?
01:45:24 Also, just a quick side note, I found everybody in PCP
01:45:29 through Munchy, through arm retrieval.
01:45:31 It's just a fun fact and nobody cares.
01:45:33 But I'm pretty sure I'm the only person
01:45:36 who was a Munchy fan before anybody else's fan.
01:45:40 That's not true.
01:45:40 Fascinating.
01:45:41 There is a class of people, a lower class of people,
01:45:46 who found arm retrieval through the Homestuck subreddit,
01:45:50 which I wonder if that's where you found arm retrieval.
01:45:52 But I know that some people found it through the subreddit
01:45:54 and discovered the PCP through that.
01:45:56 I think, pretty wild.
01:45:57 Fascinating.
01:45:57 Yeah, there's a number.
01:46:00 I don't know how many of the people who are arm retrieval big fans
01:46:06 knew about the PCP at all before.
01:46:08 Like, I don't know, like this...
01:46:11 You could maybe say, does it count to be a...
01:46:13 Like, if you got in through the Spirit Science lecture
01:46:15 or the other lecture he did, the Deagle-Mation...
01:46:19 If you got in through the Spirit Science lecture,
01:46:21 I think definitely, Deagle-Mation.
01:46:23 Deagle-Mation, thank you.
01:46:25 Yeah, that would count.
01:46:26 Then you hear through Munchie, for sure.
01:46:29 Yeah, agreed.
01:46:29 I wonder how many people found the PCP
01:46:33 through the Christian lecture.
01:46:35 I mean...
01:46:35 Gotta be some.
01:46:36 It's gotta be some.
01:46:37 I've never...
01:46:38 It's funny, people say...
01:46:38 Gotta give a straw poll going.
01:46:39 I hear people say, I found it through Munchie.
01:46:41 I've never heard anyone say, oh yeah,
01:46:42 I found the PCP through the Sonichu lecture.
01:46:44 But numerically, there must be people like that.
01:46:46 Guys, in the disc, yeah.
01:46:49 Guys, viewers watching, type where you found the PCP from.
01:46:54 Who did you find us?
01:46:56 Don't bother Digigi.
01:46:58 I don't care.
01:46:59 Yeah, just delete your account and kill yourself.
01:47:02 Oh, only?
01:47:05 Yeah.
01:47:06 Couldn't have said it better myself.
01:47:08 T-Bat.
01:47:08 Oh, what was the guy's question or something about?
01:47:10 Oh, and the question was just like,
01:47:13 my friend says one piece sucks,
01:47:14 because Luffy didn't win yet, and he isn't the pirate king.
01:47:17 It's a series designed to go on a long time.
01:47:19 Every...
01:47:20 There's been progress continuous.
01:47:22 It's not like Naruto.
01:47:23 It's about the journey.
01:47:26 It's about the...
01:47:27 It's not like Naruto where we can't gauge
01:47:29 how much progress is being made other than just beating certain guys.
01:47:32 They are making literal, linear progress
01:47:35 towards the end of one piece every time they move islands,
01:47:38 and they do things.
01:47:40 I mean, I don't know if the guy...
01:47:41 If only there was a podcast you could listen to
01:47:43 that broke down in excruciating detail.
01:47:45 Imagine that.
01:47:46 The moment-to-moment greatness that is one piece.
01:47:48 If only.
01:47:49 But such a thing just sadly doesn't exist.
01:47:51 Well, it does, actually.
01:47:52 This is called the Podicast.
01:47:54 What?
01:47:56 It sounds good.
01:47:58 Where can I find this incredible resource?
01:48:00 youtube.com slash thepodicast.
01:48:05 It's hard for Google to type it in,
01:48:08 and people say, you mean podcast?
01:48:10 Like, no.
01:48:11 No, idiot.
01:48:12 You got to force Google to bend to your will.
01:48:15 And that's the only way you can find.
01:48:16 There's some marketing issues there,
01:48:17 but we can work on that, I suppose.
01:48:20 Anyway.
01:48:21 It wouldn't be a PCP adjacent project
01:48:22 if it was just totally algorithmically dead right from the get go.
01:48:27 Oh, wait.
01:48:27 I forgot.
01:48:28 It's actually the Podicast Pirates is the full URL of that one.
01:48:31 Oh, okay.
01:48:32 But like, yeah.
01:48:33 We're the reason projects are dying.
01:48:37 Like, I don't know whether he reads the manga
01:48:40 because he says he knows his friend is wrong because we're right.
01:48:44 Does that mean he doesn't read the thing?
01:48:46 Because clearly, if he did,
01:48:48 he would understand how to refute that and say, just because...
01:48:52 I don't think he does.
01:48:53 Like, the ending of the, you know,
01:48:55 when Luffy becomes the Pirate King,
01:48:56 that's when the series will end and it's not over.
01:48:58 That's all you really need to say.
01:49:01 Yeah.
01:49:02 I mean, and you hear people who aren't big fans,
01:49:04 or maybe they've even read it,
01:49:05 but they gave up because they're like,
01:49:06 I thought Luffy was going to win.
01:49:07 Why, you know, what's happening?
01:49:09 It's just like, but every arc is like, great.
01:49:11 And like, there's always progress.
01:49:12 I mean, Naruto didn't become the Hokage until the end of Naruto.
01:49:17 And if Naruto...
01:49:17 No, not even within Naruto.
01:49:19 It wasn't what's Hokage at the end of Naruto, I don't think, right?
01:49:21 It kind of implies that he was, but...
01:49:22 No, in Boruto, he's Naruto.
01:49:24 And there's like...
01:49:25 In Boruto, he's Naruto.
01:49:26 In Boruto, he's Naruto.
01:49:27 Tell me more.
01:49:28 Hokage.
01:49:28 Damn it.
01:49:29 Yeah.
01:49:30 But like, Kakashi's Hokage by the idea of hashtag spoilers.
01:49:32 Does he become Hokage offscreen?
01:49:34 I think he...
01:49:35 Well, because like, after the narrative ends,
01:49:37 literally, Kakashi becomes the next Hokage.
01:49:39 Yeah, Kakashi is Hokage at the end of the show.
01:49:42 And then after that, Naruto then later becomes...
01:49:45 I don't know, I don't remember what happened
01:49:46 in the literal last chapter of Naruto.
01:49:48 I think he's not Hokage in that, but I could be wrong.
01:49:50 No, he isn't.
01:49:51 I watched Naruto Kai earlier this year.
01:49:53 Does it end with Kakashi as Hokage?
01:49:55 Well, there you go.
01:49:56 He doesn't become Hokage, but we all know he does eventually.
01:49:58 But it's implied that he will be after Kakashi.
01:50:01 I got it.
01:50:02 That's unsatisfying.
01:50:03 But like Boruto exists, he is Hokage in that,
01:50:05 so I guess it's fine, whatever.
01:50:07 It seems like he's Boruto, isn't it, Boruto?
01:50:10 I fucking guarantee you.
01:50:12 Luffy will be pirate king at the end of One Piece.
01:50:15 I fucking guarantee you.
01:50:15 He's already the king of the pirates in our hearts,
01:50:17 and that's all that matters.
01:50:19 Yeah, that's true.
01:50:20 It's just people see, wow, this year's been running for like 22 years.
01:50:24 Jesus Christ, what's the deal?
01:50:25 It's all been good.
01:50:26 People just can't wrap their mind around that it's actually good,
01:50:30 and it's the journey is valuable, and progress has been made.
01:50:33 You're totally right, but I think the problem that some people have
01:50:36 is just that this is, it's like when you watch a movie,
01:50:39 and it sets up the stakes and the conflict,
01:50:42 and you're there because you want to see the resolution to it.
01:50:45 I can understand some people being like,
01:50:46 I want this question to be answered, you know?
01:50:49 Yeah, that's fair.
01:50:50 But like, you shouldn't ignore that that question comes up
01:50:54 like every arc and is addressed,
01:50:56 and everything they're doing is moving towards it.
01:50:58 You just can't forget that everything they're doing
01:51:01 is in pursuit of that goal.
01:51:03 Some people is just dumb.
01:51:06 Yeah, that's, yeah, you know.
01:51:08 And you know what?
01:51:09 I don't even blame people who are like, Jesus Christ,
01:51:12 20 years, like I'm out.
01:51:13 If they don't want to be on a journey for that long, that's fine.
01:51:16 Well, they don't need to be,
01:51:18 because it's already been going for 20 years,
01:51:19 but it takes a lot less time to read the thing
01:51:21 than it does to write it.
01:51:22 Well, that's true.
01:51:23 That's true.
01:51:24 But you get people, like even Michelle was like,
01:51:25 Jesus Christ, by the time I read one piece all the way,
01:51:28 like I'll be done.
01:51:29 But it's like, no, you can read in like a month easily.
01:51:31 Here's the...
01:51:32 Well, not easily, but pretty fast.
01:51:34 I understand.
01:51:35 If you spend a full work week,
01:51:37 if you commit 40 hours a week to reading it maybe.
01:51:40 There's like one thing, like Game of Thrones,
01:51:42 I will only read that when it's finished,
01:51:45 because people have been waiting for a long time.
01:51:48 But like, I don't...
01:51:49 I love it, but...
01:51:50 Just because it's been taking a long time to get written,
01:51:54 I don't make a judgment on it being like shit or anything.
01:51:58 Like, I don't understand people who would make judgments
01:52:00 on things based on how long it's been coming out.
01:52:04 I could see why people,
01:52:05 I think a lot of people just make an assumption,
01:52:07 because it's been going on so long,
01:52:08 they assume it must like not be getting to the point.
01:52:12 It must like be stagnating and not being good.
01:52:14 One piece really is that rare exception.
01:52:17 It really is the one that was designed with this in mind
01:52:20 and has not failed to do so,
01:52:23 unless you just need a story to get to the point faster.
01:52:27 But it...
01:52:27 If you need a story to get to the point faster,
01:52:31 then you can just watch like a movie.
01:52:36 I mean, absolutely true.
01:52:37 And one piece is literally a series about how...
01:52:40 Like one of the main points is
01:52:42 that it's about the journey, not the destination.
01:52:44 The destination matters,
01:52:46 but it's about the fucking journey
01:52:47 and boy has it been a great journey with purpose, with intent.
01:52:50 I feel like if you're asking this question,
01:52:56 like why hasn't he become pirate?
01:52:57 Like you can't be like a fan of the series.
01:53:01 I think that the caller here,
01:53:03 I don't even know if they have not won,
01:53:04 but you just have to like adjust your perception of it.
01:53:08 You're kind of looking at it the wrong way.
01:53:09 Well, this person's on your side.
01:53:11 Like why do you think he's not a...
01:53:12 I think, I'm not even saying they're wrong.
01:53:14 I mean, it sounds to me when he says,
01:53:16 I know you're right.
01:53:16 Well, I think what he's saying is I agree with you.
01:53:18 I just can't put it into words and explain it.
01:53:22 I was thinking that he was saying it like,
01:53:24 look, I listen to the PCP, whatever you guys say,
01:53:27 I know is true.
01:53:27 I mean, I hope that's what it is.
01:53:29 And it's possible.
01:53:31 Yeah, me too.
01:53:32 And you know, if you want to be truly right,
01:53:34 you got to go over to patreon.com slash...
01:53:36 The podcast, no, the podcast pirates.
01:53:40 The more you play as a writer, you are.
01:53:42 That's the formula.
01:53:44 Exactly.
01:53:45 Like we give the true secrets of knowledge
01:53:47 to the big patrons.
01:53:50 We actually, we literally do have a stratified patron of,
01:53:53 let's see, there's just the one piece discussion,
01:53:55 then there's Marie-Joy, then there's...
01:53:58 Raftel.
01:53:59 Raftel or Lafts Tale.
01:54:02 And then there's the actual crow's nest,
01:54:04 the treasure vault, the commander's lounge,
01:54:06 and finally the empty throne for those gods who...
01:54:09 Ooh, that gives me the chills.
01:54:13 Oh, Ben, you don't even know, but the empty throne
01:54:15 is the thing that's been introduced in one piece
01:54:17 and is, it's very mysterious.
01:54:20 No, I'm...
01:54:21 I mean, one of these days, I'll catch up.
01:54:25 And then the Lord will descend from heaven with a shout
01:54:30 and the beast with seven horns will do something scary.
01:54:34 You're finishing Dros Rosa.
01:54:35 You've got Zo next, then you've got Whole Cake Island,
01:54:38 and then you're on Wano now,
01:54:39 which is like maybe half or so over.
01:54:41 Ooh, ooh, a lot of good stuff.
01:54:43 Yeah, I got a lot of treats waiting for me.
01:54:47 Indeed you do.
01:54:49 Okay, next one we've got a voicemail from
01:54:52 Mr. Over the Waste T. Itzman is the name.
01:54:57 All right, go.
01:54:58 Hey, Dick.
01:54:59 Hey, Sean.
01:55:01 You know what makes me a fucking rage?
01:55:03 Calling into the wrong fucking podcast.
01:55:06 Spend all this time thinking up what you're gonna say,
01:55:09 and you try your best to make it interesting
01:55:11 to impart even a modicum of entertainment
01:55:14 to the good folks listening at home,
01:55:16 but then you accidentally call the wrong fucking voice line
01:55:19 and leave a message for the wrong fucking people,
01:55:22 and now you're just a fucking idiot
01:55:24 who can't type URLs into his browser properly.
01:55:27 If that ever happened to me,
01:55:28 I'd probably just fucking kill myself.
01:55:32 Yeah.
01:55:33 Anyway, that's my rage.
01:55:35 Well, I love you guys.
01:55:36 Hope.
01:55:36 Go fuck yourself.
01:55:38 Hopefully, I mean,
01:55:40 hopefully he doesn't even listen to this podcast,
01:55:42 so I'll never know.
01:55:44 He'll be in sweet ignorance.
01:55:47 That's the one.
01:55:48 Ignorance.
01:55:48 I hope, yeah.
01:55:50 Hopefully.
01:55:51 Stay away.
01:55:52 That's what we all want.
01:55:52 All right.
01:55:54 Next up, we've got, okay, pick a number.
01:55:58 Pick a number.
01:55:58 What a dead tent, yo, PCP.
01:56:01 Could I get you guys to all agree
01:56:04 and come to a consensus on picking a number
01:56:09 between one and 244?
01:56:12 Thank you.
01:56:15 Okay, let's pick a number.
01:56:17 What do you agree?
01:56:18 Give throughout 10.
01:56:19 10's good.
01:56:20 I could roll with 10.
01:56:21 A little basic.
01:56:22 A little basic.
01:56:23 I'm going to go with 100,
01:56:24 because that's what I'm always keeping it.
01:56:27 Damn.
01:56:28 I'm going to go with 144,
01:56:30 because it's 12 squared,
01:56:31 and I've always liked that number.
01:56:32 It is a good number.
01:56:33 I'm going to go with 88.
01:56:35 88.
01:56:36 Okay, then I'll change my number to 14.
01:56:38 Something about that number, it seems good.
01:56:40 I'm going to go with 144.
01:56:41 I'm going to 144.
01:56:43 You convinced me.
01:56:44 Where are we all supposed to collectively choose one?
01:56:47 I'm going to switch over to pi.
01:56:49 I think pi is a really good number.
01:56:51 Oh, you can't even say that's a four.
01:56:52 Going to some floats.
01:56:53 No more integers here.
01:56:55 That's cheating, but I'm for it.
01:56:57 It's going to make calculations hard.
01:56:59 He didn't say how long it was for.
01:57:00 No, no, it makes the calculations easy, Nate.
01:57:02 It's just the ratio of the diameter to the fucking radius.
01:57:05 Yeah, I mean, think about it this way.
01:57:07 If you chose 144, he has to hit three buttons,
01:57:10 but if you pick pi, you just have to hit one button.
01:57:12 Yeah, just find the easy pi button on your keyboard.
01:57:16 Yeah, okay.
01:57:17 Oh, God.
01:57:18 You know what?
01:57:18 Fine, pi.
01:57:19 Tom, are you in agreement, pi?
01:57:21 I mean, I think it'll ruin whatever bit he's going to go for,
01:57:23 but if we want to fucking throw a monkey wrench in there, I'm down.
01:57:26 Let's fucking do it.
01:57:27 All right.
01:57:28 He didn't say integers.
01:57:29 He didn't say integers.
01:57:30 He did not say integers.
01:57:31 We've done everything he has.
01:57:32 All right.
01:57:32 Okay.
01:57:33 So, let us know.
01:57:35 Call in.
01:57:36 Let us know what's up if we fucked you over royally.
01:57:39 Wait, is there any follow-up to this?
01:57:42 No, that's all there is for now.
01:57:43 It's a mystery box.
01:57:45 Did he say there was going to be more?
01:57:46 I thought it was just pick a number.
01:57:48 He did not say there'd be no more.
01:57:50 I just wanted to do us a favor and call in.
01:57:52 Let us know.
01:57:53 I think this is it.
01:57:54 I think this was the point.
01:57:56 Just to pick a number.
01:57:57 I'm hoping it's four something.
01:57:59 I feel confident that it is not four anything.
01:58:01 And that the journey is a destination.
01:58:02 I have more faith in our viewers than that.
01:58:05 I would like to.
01:58:06 It would have been nice if he told us what it was for.
01:58:07 He didn't promise anything.
01:58:09 And frankly, I don't know.
01:58:10 Her ruin's the mistake.
01:58:10 I mean, I'm okay with that.
01:58:12 I'm just thinking if we say pie, then maybe he'll bake us a pie.
01:58:15 And it'll be really nice.
01:58:17 Yeah, that sounds good.
01:58:18 Maybe it's how many candles to put on my birthday cake.
01:58:20 And we gave him a real tricky answer there.
01:58:22 Strawberry and rhubarb, please.
01:58:24 Ooh, that's good.
01:58:25 Okay.
01:58:26 All right, enough of that.
01:58:27 On to the next question, voicemail.
01:58:29 We've got the professional Nate Triggerer.
01:58:32 Okay, let's get to it.
01:58:34 We'll see.
01:58:34 What's your name?
01:58:35 Nate.
01:58:37 King de Matz 3.
01:58:40 No.
01:58:40 Final Fantasy VII Remake.
01:58:45 A Gurren login sequel.
01:58:49 This last chapter, one piece was the best ever.
01:58:54 No, it's not.
01:58:56 You read one piece wrong, my friend.
01:58:58 You know, triggering Nate is a tough job,
01:59:00 but somebody's got to do it.
01:59:03 Yeah, that's true.
01:59:05 It's a living.
01:59:06 Just a literal brain holocaust for me.
01:59:09 I like that.
01:59:11 That's the beginning.
01:59:12 All right, there you go.
01:59:14 I'm slapping him in voice jail.
01:59:16 We can't allow this man to run ramp.
01:59:17 No, no, mercy.
01:59:18 Sanctuary.
01:59:20 Okay, we'll see.
01:59:21 No, I want him out there.
01:59:23 I'm going to get him some voicemail so he can get out.
01:59:26 All right.
01:59:27 I feel like we've made that joke before, but it's not old.
01:59:30 It's not old.
01:59:30 We need to have something between the voice
01:59:32 grail and the voice jail, like the PC purgatory.
01:59:38 That's good.
01:59:39 Voice a community service.
01:59:41 Did we decide that communist hell is below the
01:59:44 dungeons of the PCP jail or voice jail?
01:59:47 That seems good.
01:59:47 I don't think we described that yet, but I like it.
01:59:49 Can someone draw like a Dante's Inferno style?
01:59:51 Communist hell is under everything.
01:59:54 Can somebody?
01:59:54 Cosmology.
01:59:56 Can somebody build the PCP voice jail in the
01:59:59 PCP Minecraft server?
02:00:01 That'd be great.
02:00:02 Yeah.
02:00:02 Oh, that would be.
02:00:03 I actually, you know,
02:00:03 can we like quit like named NPCs in there or something?
02:00:06 Like literally next to Slime Corp.
02:00:08 Oh, we should.
02:00:09 Someone was building.
02:00:10 It was it was a juvenile detention center was being
02:00:13 built right next to Slime Corp HQ in the Minecraft server.
02:00:16 Okay.
02:00:16 Okay.
02:00:17 And I keep working on it, lads.
02:00:19 Keep working on it.
02:00:20 That's got a lot.
02:00:21 We got a lot of Jews to lock up.
02:00:22 That's pretty good.
02:00:24 Okay.
02:00:24 I got to get in on this fucking server.
02:00:26 I'm so sad.
02:00:26 I'm so sad.
02:00:27 I missed the first one.
02:00:28 I really wanted to be there,
02:00:29 but I just wasn't around when it happened.
02:00:31 Too bad.
02:00:31 Yeah, there'll be plenty more,
02:00:32 plenty more to come.
02:00:33 Okay.
02:00:34 So a few people want to be in there.
02:00:35 You want to play with us?
02:00:36 That's patreon.com slash pcb minecraft.
02:00:38 $5 a month only.
02:00:40 Let's go.
02:00:41 Join your friends.
02:00:42 It'll be good.
02:00:42 Okay.
02:00:43 Next up.
02:00:43 Okay.
02:00:44 Now here we go.
02:00:45 So this is a sequence of,
02:00:46 I think it's just three voicemails technically about an
02:00:50 issue that we were going to bring up.
02:00:52 We didn't yet.
02:00:53 Okay.
02:00:53 Let's just hear the first one.
02:00:54 It's a message from the past.
02:00:56 Okay.
02:00:57 Here we go.
02:00:57 Go.
02:00:58 This is a message from your past.
02:01:00 The Joker N-word countdown is at 24 hours,
02:01:05 four hours ago.
02:01:06 We've done nothing to stop him.
02:01:08 There's nothing we can do.
02:01:10 He's inevitable.
02:01:11 He's going to do it.
02:01:11 He's going to say the N-word.
02:01:13 We're so sorry.
02:01:16 If there's still a society after this is over,
02:01:19 we want you to know when we could.
02:01:22 There was nothing we could do to stop him.
02:01:27 Okay.
02:01:28 So there you go, lads.
02:01:29 I don't know.
02:01:30 If you weren't aware.
02:01:30 I don't know this meme.
02:01:32 Okay.
02:01:32 Well, Ben, let me tell you.
02:01:34 Me and Tom have been following this.
02:01:36 So from 10 days before the Joker movie came out,
02:01:41 a Twitter appeared at Joker and was called the Twitter N-word
02:01:45 countdown.
02:01:46 The Twitter, the Joker N-word countdown?
02:01:49 That's right.
02:01:49 The Joker N-word countdown or something approximately like that.
02:01:52 And it was saying just 10 days until I say it was the only thing posted.
02:01:57 Then nine days before the release,
02:01:59 nine days until I say it.
02:02:00 This started with zero followers.
02:02:02 By the time we got to the day,
02:02:04 it had over 130,000 followers on this Twitter account
02:02:08 posting basically just this.
02:02:09 Pretty cool.
02:02:10 And so it was eight days until I say it.
02:02:12 He's going to watch.
02:02:13 Yeah, you can look at it.
02:02:15 The whole society was crumbling.
02:02:16 Infrastructure is breaking down.
02:02:18 Moral panic was spiked to the heights.
02:02:21 And this is just the Joker at work.
02:02:22 This is just what he does.
02:02:24 And so this progressed until like a couple of days before.
02:02:26 I believe it was the day before he was going to say it.
02:02:30 He released a tweet with a video.
02:02:33 Let me see if I can get this real quick.
02:02:35 But it was a video that featured countless African American individuals.
02:02:40 And it was a video of him sewing image after image of them
02:02:45 giving the Joker their N-word passes.
02:02:48 This was like dozens, if not hundreds of people in this video
02:02:52 giving him countless N-word passes.
02:02:55 And so he just continued on his quest to say it.
02:02:59 To say it.
02:03:00 And so the day comes 24 hours until I say it.
02:03:03 10 hours until I say it.
02:03:04 Finally, there was one that was like 60 seconds until I say it.
02:03:08 And at last he released a video.
02:03:10 And it was the Joker.
02:03:12 Okay, let me just grab it real quick.
02:03:13 It's like right here.
02:03:15 And it's him, it's a video produced, the production value.
02:03:18 Okay, got it right here.
02:03:19 Look at this shit in the main chat.
02:03:23 Just take a look at this real quick.
02:03:24 The production value, like this guy hadn't made any videos.
02:03:27 He just made that one of all the N-word passes he'd been given by all those people.
02:03:30 And it was very rough.
02:03:32 It was incredible.
02:03:34 And this video is him sitting there saying,
02:03:37 you know, society isn't ready for what I'm about to do.
02:03:39 This video has over like 2 million plays.
02:03:41 2.7 million views at this point.
02:03:44 168,000 likes, like 4,000 responses, 50,000 retweets basically on the day.
02:03:49 And so he gets up to the end.
02:03:51 He says, you know, they tried to stop me, but this is my moment and I'm doing what I can do.
02:03:57 And then as he's about to say, he takes a deep breath.
02:04:00 The black man, the black man, a Batman wearing black guy,
02:04:04 bursts in and stops him and says the word instead,
02:04:07 stopping the Joker and his white privilege from running rampant
02:04:11 and destroying all hopes of him crumbling society.
02:04:14 Society was preserved.
02:04:16 And so, you know, the Joker accepts defeat that the black man stopped him.
02:04:19 Maybe next time he'll be able to say it.
02:04:22 And that's that.
02:04:23 But at the very end of the video, if you listen carefully,
02:04:25 he says, like, I was stopped again by the black man.
02:04:28 And then he says a word that's bleeped.
02:04:30 And then the black man says, don't say it, nigga.
02:04:33 And that's the end of the video.
02:04:34 Okay.
02:04:35 That's the end of the video.
02:04:36 So all right.
02:04:37 So this is his, this is the climax of the joke.
02:04:40 And okay.
02:04:40 So that's not the end of the story, though,
02:04:42 because there's a couple of things going on.
02:04:44 So just on this subject and tell him,
02:04:47 I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.
02:04:49 I'll just say that my analysis of this is, I loved this bit.
02:04:53 I thought it was hilarious.
02:04:54 I'm a well-known thinker that, you know, free speech guy,
02:04:58 like it's hilarious to act like just saying a word
02:05:01 is like such an amazing thing that like,
02:05:03 anyone's going to have a problem with just a word being said.
02:05:06 It's very silly.
02:05:06 We know it's offensive, blah, blah, blah, whatever.
02:05:08 So I was, I was looking forward to this as, you know,
02:05:11 just like a funny fuck you to everybody.
02:05:13 Now, technically, at the end of the video, this, you know,
02:05:17 he's a white guy who's playing the Joker here.
02:05:19 He does say it, but it's bleeped.
02:05:21 And to me, if the point of this whole thing
02:05:24 was to be like how silly it is that we're so worked up
02:05:28 about this word being so, like, just to say, not to call anyone,
02:05:32 not to spit it, but just to say, and he,
02:05:35 and he feels the need to bleep it in his video.
02:05:38 Doesn't that actually reinforce the narrative
02:05:40 that it shouldn't say the word?
02:05:42 And it kind of cut against the point.
02:05:44 But Nate, yeah.
02:05:46 Did you not see the tweet?
02:05:49 Oh, I did, Tom.
02:05:50 So the very next day, I do the very next day,
02:05:54 we see the guy say, fuck it, hashtag nigger on this account.
02:05:59 That's, that's what happened.
02:06:00 That's what was posted on his account.
02:06:03 And okay.
02:06:04 So, but, so everyone's like, oh my God, he said it.
02:06:06 He actually said it.
02:06:07 Now, I mean, it seems like the bleep,
02:06:10 like the fact that his was bleeped and the black man's wasn't,
02:06:13 like that seems like the point.
02:06:16 Well, I mean, but yeah, that is the point,
02:06:19 but isn't that by bleeping it, isn't that just saying,
02:06:21 like it literally is okay for simply a word to be said
02:06:24 by, you know, the demographic it's about,
02:06:26 or whatever, black people, but not anybody else,
02:06:29 you know, particularly white people.
02:06:29 Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's the,
02:06:32 that's the commentary or whatever, right?
02:06:35 But I mean, but he's, he is like whipping up hysteria.
02:06:38 Double standard or whatever.
02:06:40 I think the, no, the interesting thing to me, Nate,
02:06:43 like, okay, I don't know what, like,
02:06:46 because when the video dropped, I was like,
02:06:48 yeah, that was like a really well done video
02:06:50 and it's fucking funny.
02:06:51 Of course.
02:06:52 But there was a part of me that was like, man,
02:06:54 I kind of just wanted to watch the shit show
02:06:56 if he like just actually did it and to see what would happen.
02:06:59 Because that was really the most interesting part to me.
02:07:01 It's like, I was interested in the, the inevitable fallout.
02:07:04 I kind of think it would have been more interesting
02:07:07 if it had just been like a five second video
02:07:09 of him just saying the word and nothing else.
02:07:12 I'm looking at this, the Twitter right now,
02:07:14 and he's totally rebranded this Twitter
02:07:16 from what it was like two days ago.
02:07:18 Well, Tom, do you know why that is?
02:07:20 I don't, I guess I've missed part of the story.
02:07:23 Yeah, I'm getting to this.
02:07:24 Okay, so like I said, like the guy, so I feel,
02:07:28 and this guy had actually tweeted,
02:07:29 I'm going to get to that point, Tom,
02:07:30 because the big things have happened then,
02:07:31 like it lasts like day or something about this Twitter.
02:07:34 So like I said, this Twitter has like 130,000 followers,
02:07:37 like a lot of people have unsub
02:07:38 because the joke's over or whatever.
02:07:40 But like he actually, the guy who did it
02:07:43 has a separate Twitter account that I was,
02:07:45 it's like Connor or something, I'll link in the description.
02:07:48 So like we know who the guy is who did it.
02:07:50 He's like a reasonably small time YouTube comedian,
02:07:52 but he had this really funny idea for the skit.
02:07:54 And like after he posted the video,
02:07:56 he updated his bio to have the at to that guy.
02:07:59 So we 100% know like who the guy was,
02:08:01 looks just like him, you know, that's all there is to it.
02:08:04 Behind the scenes footage, et cetera.
02:08:07 Like on that guy's account, I started following,
02:08:08 because I was curious, you know,
02:08:09 what the man himself had to say about all this.
02:08:11 And he was saying things like,
02:08:12 like one thing he said was like,
02:08:14 maybe the worst thing about all of this is like, if I,
02:08:19 or he said like, maybe the real evil here
02:08:22 was getting so many people to wish that I'd said.
02:08:24 Right, yeah, that was going to bring up.
02:08:27 That's an interesting point to make.
02:08:29 So it sounds like with that point,
02:08:31 he's saying that like, no, no, no,
02:08:33 none of this was necessarily about like,
02:08:37 like defanging a word or pointing to the absurdity
02:08:39 of overvaluing a word just by itself,
02:08:42 not insulting people, but just saying a word.
02:08:44 It was actually like a troll, like here I am,
02:08:47 like, like the only reason someone could want me
02:08:50 to say the N word here is because they're racist.
02:08:53 It sounds to me like this guy didn't really have a clear
02:08:59 like theme or anything.
02:09:01 I think that's what I think.
02:09:02 I think the timeline of events here was that,
02:09:05 I think that's my perspective on the timeline of events
02:09:09 is that he started the account or repurposing.
02:09:13 It started with zero followers, by the way.
02:09:14 So he did not like, no, this was going to.
02:09:16 Yeah, because this account was made in 2013.
02:09:19 So like, he repurposed this account clearly
02:09:21 for this purpose when he had the idea for the joke.
02:09:23 So like, he starts and I'm sure he's not expecting it
02:09:27 to be calm as huge as it does.
02:09:29 And I'm assuming that it probably would have been
02:09:32 a very straightforward thing if it stayed small,
02:09:34 but when you have over 100,000 people waiting for you
02:09:37 to drop an n-bomb and like question if you're going
02:09:39 to hard art and shit, like it's that point you're like,
02:09:41 oh God, I have to do something like actually
02:09:44 worth the attention that I have now.
02:09:45 And I think this skit probably came from that.
02:09:47 I think maybe he overthought it.
02:09:50 I agree, Ben.
02:09:51 But like the change here is that because I think
02:09:54 he made the video probably because it's just like,
02:09:55 oh God, like there might be some actual ramifications
02:09:59 if I actually do it with this kind of spotlight on me.
02:10:02 So there's this whole skit.
02:10:02 Most cancel culture.
02:10:03 But then he did it anyway.
02:10:04 Right.
02:10:05 But that's the point because the account after the video
02:10:10 was very much like, okay, the bid is over.
02:10:12 Here's my actual account.
02:10:13 This is who I actually am.
02:10:14 This is the comedy I actually do.
02:10:16 And then he was making those comments
02:10:17 because I think there were a contingent of people
02:10:19 who were kind of bummed that it didn't actually happen.
02:10:22 Like the promise was not delivered in a direct way.
02:10:25 And so that tweet that you just mentioned, Nate,
02:10:27 about maybe the real evil was getting everyone to be excited,
02:10:30 that kind of feels like a justification made after the fact.
02:10:33 Like this is a way of spinning people's disappointment.
02:10:36 And then I feel like now, looking at the account now,
02:10:39 where it's unbranded and back to just being its own thing,
02:10:41 that he's just leaning into what everyone
02:10:43 really wanted the whole time.
02:10:45 Well, Tom, let me tell you why that's not the case.
02:10:48 It's because, at least as far as we know,
02:10:50 this could be an elaborate hoax.
02:10:53 He just dropped the hard R and bomb after,
02:10:56 like the day after, or like two days after.
02:10:58 It's because both his original account,
02:11:00 according to him on a video he posted on Instagram
02:11:03 or Facebook or something, both accounts were hacked.
02:11:07 Were hacked by, what was it?
02:11:10 The chuckling squad.
02:11:12 And if you look on his Twitter at The Joker,
02:11:15 it says right now, the pin tweet is a link to a Discord
02:11:18 and hashtag chuckling squad.
02:11:20 So unless this is some sort of particularly elaborate hoax.
02:11:23 Like it was hacked after the fact?
02:11:25 Yeah, because this had drawn so much attention,
02:11:28 and in the video, the guy bleeps out him saying the N-word,
02:11:31 allows the black guy to say it, blah, blah, blah.
02:11:33 It seems that he really decided,
02:11:35 or whatever, maybe never intended, to say it at all.
02:11:39 But now he just goes hashtag and says it on his account.
02:11:42 It really does look like he almost assuredly
02:11:44 was in fact hacked, and someone decided,
02:11:48 you know, I'm gonna correct this guy's mistake,
02:11:51 and they've gone in here and they've actually hashtag nigger,
02:11:54 and stuff like that.
02:11:56 That seems to be what's happened as far as I can tell.
02:11:58 Yeah, because I'm seeing the Discord link.
02:12:00 I've only seen the actual tweet, not the fuck it one.
02:12:04 I will try to find a link to the video,
02:12:08 because I had just seen it before,
02:12:10 and it's him on his other account.
02:12:12 He says, guys, look, all my accounts have been hacked.
02:12:15 Even this account, I think this video will be deleted quickly,
02:12:18 but luckily it was someone to capture it or something,
02:12:20 because all his accounts were hacked,
02:12:22 and so I don't have any control over my accounts now.
02:12:29 Again, we don't know 100% that that's true.
02:12:31 I believe that it is true.
02:12:33 It seems the most likely thing,
02:12:34 because I think if he was comfortable with saying the word,
02:12:36 he would have just done it.
02:12:37 Because let me just, my last point about the video
02:12:40 is I think the joke would have been perfect and flawless,
02:12:44 because the way he slips it in at the end and just bleeps it,
02:12:47 he had built it up, he undercuts the moment,
02:12:50 and then at the end, he slips in but bleeps it,
02:12:52 and then the black guy says, nigga, whatever.
02:12:54 I felt it would have been a perfect joke
02:12:56 if he just simply had not bleeped it at the end,
02:12:59 because what does that say?
02:13:00 It undercuts the hype, and it points to the absurdity
02:13:04 of getting so excited about this word
02:13:06 when he can just put it in at the end totally anti-climatically.
02:13:10 I wouldn't understand that, because if he just says it,
02:13:14 why would you have the black man character in there
02:13:18 and also say it?
02:13:19 Well, because the black man's point in the story,
02:13:22 the black man's point in the story
02:13:23 is to stop the Joker from saying it,
02:13:25 and so I felt he represented all the people who correctly or not
02:13:31 want to stop him from saying it.
02:13:32 All right, the thing with all this, I think,
02:13:36 is that the meme, the original joke,
02:13:40 I'm gonna say the n-word,
02:13:42 is not really about race.
02:13:45 It's the equivalent of you're at your friend's house,
02:13:49 and you say to them,
02:13:50 dude, what would you do if I stepped on all your video games
02:13:55 and broke them, and then your friend goes, I hate you?
02:13:59 And he's like, but what if I did?
02:14:03 It's just sort of like a, what if I did a really bad thing?
02:14:06 And it's just sort of the rush of imagining that.
02:14:09 And it's like, I'm gonna say the n-word.
02:14:11 I'm white, I'm gonna say the n-word.
02:14:13 Like that's why it's funny.
02:14:16 There's never really been, I mean,
02:14:18 among the people I've seen make that joke,
02:14:20 it's just sort of like kids who are like,
02:14:22 haha, I'm gonna say something bad.
02:14:25 It's hoping to sacred cow is what it's doing.
02:14:27 That seems to be the point of the joke.
02:14:28 Sacred cow, the n-word, precious.
02:14:32 And it's like this guy, I'm sure,
02:14:34 feels the same way about it,
02:14:35 which is why he had this whole like,
02:14:36 the black man stops him in the end.
02:14:38 And he's clearly an edgy comedian.
02:14:40 I've looked at his thing that I assume
02:14:42 that was what he was getting at.
02:14:44 If not that, I don't understand the joke.
02:14:45 Well, I don't know.
02:14:47 Whatever.
02:14:48 I mean, I don't understand the joke either way.
02:14:52 I mean, I don't think he had us like a vision for this
02:14:59 when it started.
02:14:59 This is what's, I mean, based on the conclusion,
02:15:02 I'm forced to agree that I think,
02:15:05 look, my reading of the situation
02:15:07 isn't the only valid one.
02:15:08 Maybe someone else understands this better.
02:15:09 I mean, I'd be curious to hear
02:15:10 what people have to say about it,
02:15:12 because this was a very interesting phenomenon I found.
02:15:14 If the point of this wasn't to basically make fun
02:15:19 of this word that I feel is given disproportionate power,
02:15:24 no one's being called anything.
02:15:25 He's just saying a word.
02:15:27 That's the point of this.
02:15:29 Surely, we shouldn't get too excited about that, right?
02:15:33 So if that wasn't the point, I don't get the point.
02:15:38 So yeah, that's where I feel.
02:15:40 I mean, I'm going to be, it's not optimistic.
02:15:44 I feel like the point was just to get the attention,
02:15:48 and he did it.
02:15:49 He did.
02:15:50 He did.
02:15:51 And you know what?
02:15:51 We should, I actually like the guy.
02:15:53 I think he did a good job overall.
02:15:55 The fact that he delivered with an impressively made video
02:15:58 at the end, even if it didn't exactly do the joke
02:16:00 the way I would have done it,
02:16:01 I still think his grounds for it's impressive,
02:16:04 it's worth celebrating,
02:16:05 he like almost got the joke perfectly in my mind.
02:16:08 So I don't know, I still really like the guy.
02:16:10 I respect what he did.
02:16:11 I mean, really, it's one of those like,
02:16:14 where the imagination is the entire thing.
02:16:17 Like the fact that there's a Twitter account
02:16:19 and he's counting down to saying the n-word,
02:16:21 that's the joke.
02:16:22 That's where you laugh.
02:16:23 That's the punchline in itself.
02:16:25 That's the fact that it exists.
02:16:27 He got so many n-word passes, guys.
02:16:30 Yeah, all the n-word passes.
02:16:31 That's really funny.
02:16:32 That's hilarious.
02:16:33 The culmination, I don't think it's even possible
02:16:36 to please everyone with that.
02:16:38 Yeah.
02:16:39 Yeah, yeah.
02:16:40 You know what, when he first ended the thing,
02:16:41 he said, he changed his bio before it seemingly got hacked,
02:16:44 he like his bio became,
02:16:46 they're gonna hate you either way,
02:16:47 with a link to his normal friends.
02:16:49 So I mean, yeah, I mean, that's true.
02:16:51 But let's not play the joke.
02:16:52 I think he should have just committed to the bit
02:16:53 and just done it.
02:16:54 I think he should have just done it.
02:16:55 Like, I couldn't agree more.
02:16:56 I think it would have been a more interesting experiment,
02:17:01 if you want to call it that.
02:17:02 If he just fucking done it.
02:17:04 Like, just, like not.
02:17:05 And so, to those?
02:17:07 I get the temptation to subvert your audience's expectations,
02:17:10 but I don't really think, I don't know.
02:17:12 I mean, I haven't watched this video yet,
02:17:14 because it's two and a half minutes long,
02:17:15 and I have to check out the web.
02:17:16 But like, the way you describe it,
02:17:18 doesn't really sound like he subverted it
02:17:19 in a way that's that funny.
02:17:21 No, I don't think so.
02:17:23 I don't think so.
02:17:24 He's just sort of like, you know, he gets ready.
02:17:26 He's like, you know, faffing around,
02:17:29 like coughing, like getting his throes.
02:17:31 Clearing his throes.
02:17:32 Like, okay, you know, the obvious misdirect is to not do it,
02:17:37 after all that, like, silly build up.
02:17:39 And then he does not actually do it, really.
02:17:43 And I don't know.
02:17:44 He kinda does it.
02:17:46 He kinda does, but he censors it.
02:17:48 Which, I mean, the first time I watched it,
02:17:50 I wasn't even sure what was happening.
02:17:52 I think, like, the fact that he didn't say it,
02:17:54 was like, oh, well, the video's over.
02:17:56 Like, whatever happens after that,
02:17:58 I just wasn't really paying attention.
02:18:00 I don't know.
02:18:02 I just think it's very interesting to me.
02:18:06 I don't know.
02:18:07 And anyone who thinks that, like, oh, he changed his mind,
02:18:10 and he just tweeted it out, I don't think that's correct.
02:18:13 I believe that he was hacked.
02:18:14 This is what I think is extremely wrong.
02:18:16 Oh, with the hashtag?
02:18:17 With the hashtag.
02:18:18 Yeah, I mean, with the hashtag and the Discord server,
02:18:20 that does actualize it, and it seems legit to me.
02:18:23 That would just be, like, that would just completely undermine
02:18:28 whatever he was trying to do with the final video.
02:18:30 Exactly.
02:18:30 That would completely undermine it.
02:18:32 It would be really fucking dumb.
02:18:33 And that's one of the main reasons I think he was, in fact, hacked.
02:18:35 And by the way, they say that these chuckling squad guys
02:18:38 are the same guys who hacked Etika after he died,
02:18:40 and then also, like, Jack, when Jack's account,
02:18:42 like Twitter head guy, got his account hacked.
02:18:45 So, again, I don't know that for sure,
02:18:47 but it seems reasonable.
02:18:48 So, you know, that seems to be the best theory.
02:18:51 I see.
02:18:52 So, there you go.
02:18:53 Fascinating.
02:18:53 Oh, and you know, there was actually two more voicemails about this.
02:18:57 They're both brief.
02:18:59 Let me just play those quickly, because they are amusing.
02:19:02 Okay.
02:19:03 Sorry.
02:19:04 About the same thing?
02:19:06 It's about this issue.
02:19:07 We don't need to spend long on it, but they were funny,
02:19:09 so I just want to play them.
02:19:10 Okay.
02:19:10 And here, this is the unironic gang weed guy.
02:19:14 So, let's hear what he has to say.
02:19:15 Go.
02:19:16 Attention, all fellow epic gamers and gang weed members.
02:19:20 That's me.
02:19:21 It is I, once again, the unironic gang weed guy.
02:19:24 Back again with an announcement for you all.
02:19:28 Joker is now in theaters.
02:19:30 That being said, no chance.
02:19:33 Veronica's especially NPCs.
02:19:35 Blumfters, boomers, or sheeple are loud.
02:19:40 That means you, Nate.
02:19:43 Which one are you?
02:19:44 You should never be afraid of the outward.
02:19:47 Did you see that guy on Twitter who said he was going to say it?
02:19:51 But didn't.
02:19:52 What a shame.
02:19:53 In his place, I will say the n-word.
02:19:58 Oh, no.
02:20:02 Because he ran out of time.
02:20:02 That was a close one.
02:20:04 Wait, he ran out of just the time.
02:20:05 Uh, interestingly, I think we have another voicemail
02:20:07 on an ironic gang weed.
02:20:08 Do you have to follow up?
02:20:09 Let's hear what he has to say.
02:20:10 Go.
02:20:13 Okay.
02:20:14 Yeah.
02:20:16 All right.
02:20:16 Oh, you rascally wab at you.
02:20:18 Yeah, that one got me.
02:20:20 That one caught me off guard.
02:20:21 Better punchline than the actual punchline.
02:20:23 Yeah, kind of.
02:20:24 Yeah, kind of.
02:20:26 Okay, another quality voicemail here.
02:20:28 We've got Racky the Robot Guy.
02:20:31 Oh, wait, before we end this,
02:20:32 we have to, I have to say that we are suing the Joker,
02:20:36 because we were talking about this before,
02:20:37 that this is actually a copied bit
02:20:40 from the Procrastinators podcast.
02:20:42 What is this but racist forest gump repurposed?
02:20:45 We, exactly.
02:20:46 We have intellectual property to all, you know,
02:20:50 attempts to say the n-word.
02:20:51 All, all racism.
02:20:51 We expect the royalties.
02:20:53 Yeah, yeah.
02:20:53 All racism is property of the pieces here.
02:20:55 Racism is our intellectual property.
02:20:58 We are the source of racism.
02:21:00 That's another t-shirt in the making.
02:21:01 We are the source of racism.
02:21:02 We are the source of racism.
02:21:04 Nope.
02:21:05 Nobody else was doing anything with racism.
02:21:08 Nobody was being racist.
02:21:09 We alone, we alone were using it,
02:21:13 and now you want to swoop in and recuperate it,
02:21:15 and I, and I won't stand for it.
02:21:17 I don't think so, buddy.
02:21:18 I don't think, now when there's money on the line,
02:21:20 sweet dollory dudes.
02:21:22 All right.
02:21:22 That's sticky icky cashish.
02:21:26 All right.
02:21:26 Next we got Racky the robot guy.
02:21:28 Okay, let's hear what he has to say.
02:21:29 Go.
02:21:31 So, a while ago, I came in contact
02:21:33 with my childhood friend again.
02:21:36 After some chatting,
02:21:37 he reveals that he's gotten his first girlfriend,
02:21:40 which surprises me,
02:21:40 since he's the most virgin loser kind of guy I know.
02:21:44 But of course, I congratulate him.
02:21:46 However, after some time,
02:21:48 it comes to light that not only
02:21:50 is this an internet relationship,
02:21:53 but the chick lives in Michigan, U.S.,
02:21:56 while we live in Sweden.
02:21:58 Yep.
02:21:59 And he plans on moving to the U.S.
02:22:02 in a year or two to live with her.
02:22:03 How old?
02:22:04 How old?
02:22:04 I want to know what these people are.
02:22:04 Mind you, he's 16,
02:22:07 and longer communication is very role-playing
02:22:10 over discourse.
02:22:13 So, he plans on skipping out
02:22:15 on the last year of high school
02:22:16 and free college,
02:22:18 which we have here in Sweden.
02:22:19 Oh.
02:22:20 So, my question is,
02:22:21 how the fuck do I make him realize
02:22:23 how impossible this relationship is
02:22:25 without him, I don't know,
02:22:27 getting mad at me?
02:22:28 Off your good man.
02:22:29 You let him get mad at you.
02:22:31 That's how.
02:22:35 Okay, he will realize this is stupid.
02:22:38 Indeed.
02:22:38 But will you be in time?
02:22:38 I would hope if nothing else,
02:22:40 the system has enough checks and balances
02:22:43 in place to prevent this from happening,
02:22:45 but he will realize that,
02:22:47 and you should just tell him that so,
02:22:50 because when he eventually realizes that,
02:22:53 like he might be mad at you now,
02:22:54 but he will appreciate you more in the future
02:22:57 because you were right,
02:22:58 and you told him the truth.
02:23:01 This is what happened.
02:23:02 And you should play him this pod,
02:23:03 you should recommend him this episode
02:23:05 of the podcast so he can hear.
02:23:06 Yeah, we can break it down for him.
02:23:07 Let him hear this section.
02:23:09 This is the symptom of the false scarcity of pussy
02:23:13 that our generation is struggling with.
02:23:16 There is no scarcity.
02:23:17 There's millions of girls in every fucking town.
02:23:19 You can go meet them.
02:23:20 And like this is just,
02:23:21 this is a guy who's clearly,
02:23:22 like never had a girlfriend.
02:23:23 Like some girl online shows him some affection.
02:23:26 He's like, I'm all in, all my chips.
02:23:28 I'm going in on this relationship.
02:23:29 This is the one.
02:23:30 Guys, this is why every guy needs to develop
02:23:34 at least a fucking little bit
02:23:35 of the basic like social graces to get a girl,
02:23:38 so that they don't like sacrifice so much
02:23:42 for some pussy across the fucking planet
02:23:44 that like, it's a furry role play.
02:23:46 Like, oh my God, are you fucking kidding me?
02:23:48 All the red flags are there.
02:23:49 Is this the quality woman that you want to spend your life with?
02:23:52 Obviously you're probably not thinking about that level,
02:23:54 but it's just, this is,
02:23:56 the desperation is so obvious to everyone.
02:23:58 And it just comes from, as I always say,
02:24:00 the biggest problem in our world right now
02:24:02 is the weakness of men, the desperation of men,
02:24:06 and this false scarcity of pussy
02:24:08 that guides every false mentality.
02:24:10 Oh my God, don't be a fool.
02:24:11 Don't be a fucking fool.
02:24:13 Literally just go ask any girl like in your class right now,
02:24:16 like just do this.
02:24:17 Like, hey, I think you're cool.
02:24:19 You want to hang out sometime?
02:24:20 You literally do that.
02:24:22 And they will be gushing as a waterfall
02:24:25 before your sheer chatteliness,
02:24:26 because like no guys do that these days,
02:24:29 especially in fucking high school.
02:24:31 Like literally just buy, go to PCP,
02:24:34 Teespring buy, and I'm just being cool T-shirt
02:24:37 and live those words.
02:24:39 Live those words and just be cool.
02:24:40 Just be cool, couldn't agree more.
02:24:42 Unironically, good advice,
02:24:44 because even if you get shot down, like, it like-
02:24:47 You still got a T-shirt.
02:24:48 So that's a win-win right there.
02:24:51 That's very true.
02:24:52 That T-shirt will be there for you no matter what.
02:24:55 But also, it breaks like the barrier of like,
02:24:58 oh God, I can't do this.
02:24:59 It's too scary, you know, what you finally do,
02:25:02 and you realize that like you don't instantly
02:25:04 die on the spot if you get shot down.
02:25:06 Yeah, exactly.
02:25:07 It makes, it goes from something unfathomable
02:25:10 to something that you've already done
02:25:12 and is clearly doable.
02:25:13 Oh my God, I know it's hard.
02:25:15 It's literally hard, it'd be hard for me if I was single.
02:25:18 It would be hard to just approach a girl I liked
02:25:20 and like say she's cute and hang out with her.
02:25:22 It's always gonna be challenging.
02:25:23 It's hard for like every guy on the planet,
02:25:25 unless you're like just like some billionaire,
02:25:27 like a party you're hosting or some shit like that.
02:25:29 What do they call that?
02:25:30 Like situational lording, the club, whatever,
02:25:32 it doesn't matter.
02:25:33 Point is, yes, just let the guy listen to this.
02:25:37 And like he will think like, wow, you know, I really am.
02:25:40 This is kind of absurd.
02:25:41 This is kind of like, there's that cute girl in my class
02:25:43 who like I would actually love to like hang out with
02:25:45 and she doesn't exist across the fucking planet.
02:25:47 Maybe I could like talk to her once
02:25:49 and like just see how that goes.
02:25:50 Maybe she's a very role player, you don't know.
02:25:53 Exactly, and you could do it in person.
02:25:55 You could put your fur suits on,
02:25:56 you could rub each other's paw, what's the word?
02:25:59 Toe beans against each other.
02:26:01 Oh, it could be lewd as hell, my dude.
02:26:03 So go for it.
02:26:05 There's literally nowhere to go but up, unfortunately.
02:26:07 He's right.
02:26:08 As fortunate as to say.
02:26:09 And yeah, be mad at us.
02:26:11 Don't be mad at your friend for pointing you're here.
02:26:13 Yes, exactly.
02:26:14 Tell them that you left a funny goofy voicemail.
02:26:16 Friend, if you're listening, you know, it's cool, you know,
02:26:19 cool, you got the internet girlfriend, that's fine.
02:26:23 It's fine.
02:26:24 You're 16, it's good, you know, good, good, whatever.
02:26:27 It's cool, nothing matters.
02:26:29 Yep.
02:26:30 It's all gravy.
02:26:33 It's like the opposite what we've been saying.
02:26:34 Don't move to America, America fucking sucks, you don't,
02:26:37 don't come here for your own sake, don't fucking.
02:26:40 At least not until after you've done the whole free college and shit,
02:26:43 like that'll be a huge fucking leg up over everybody else.
02:26:47 Yeah, and like moving away from everything you've ever known,
02:26:49 like your family, etc.
02:26:51 Basically nothing by this.
02:26:54 Okay, if you can't shake the guy,
02:26:56 if you can't fucking shake the guy on this point,
02:26:59 then, and you will in time.
02:27:00 I mean, it's not your job to shake him.
02:27:02 No, no, it's not.
02:27:03 But like this guy rightly is just like, wow, this is retarded.
02:27:05 He's just being the reasonable friend who's like,
02:27:08 I'm 100% aware of how silly this is.
02:27:10 Like if nothing else, just tell him like, okay,
02:27:14 like what happens is right now,
02:27:16 this is an illusion of relationships.
02:27:18 It's a fugazi.
02:27:19 Tell him to make it real.
02:27:21 It's a spook.
02:27:22 Tell him to make it real by saying like, okay,
02:27:24 like initiate plans to meet up.
02:27:27 And when you see all the effort that's involved in actually like,
02:27:31 it doesn't have to be moved forever,
02:27:32 but just meet up one time,
02:27:34 like make plans to do that.
02:27:36 And when he sees how fucking impossible it will happen,
02:27:38 either one of two things will happen.
02:27:40 One, the more likely thing,
02:27:41 it will completely fall through and it won't happen.
02:27:43 And I mean, let's be real, this plan will fall through.
02:27:46 It's guaranteed.
02:27:47 Absolutely.
02:27:47 But if the miracle happens,
02:27:49 and he actually puts together the money
02:27:51 and gets over there and sees the girl,
02:27:53 either he'll get like amazing bomb furry sex,
02:27:55 extremely unlikely, not going to happen.
02:27:57 I guarantee it.
02:27:58 Or what will happen is to be like,
02:28:00 oh, this kind of sucks and is not worth all the effort I put in.
02:28:03 And then the problem will go away.
02:28:04 Boy, the perfect mental image I constructed in my head
02:28:08 isn't quite lashing up to reality.
02:28:11 Has he seen what she looks like in real life?
02:28:13 I'm very curious about that,
02:28:15 because that would be very interesting to know.
02:28:17 Or has he just seen her furry OC?
02:28:18 And you've done pictures with suit off and not with suit on.
02:28:20 This is very important.
02:28:22 You can hide a lot of those things.
02:28:25 Everyone looks good in their fur suit, dude.
02:28:27 Everyone looks good in their fur suit, but...
02:28:29 Sure.
02:28:30 Yeah, I mean, when you're me,
02:28:31 you know, looking at the world through furry eyes,
02:28:33 it's just everything's gravy.
02:28:35 But okay, anyway, there you go.
02:28:37 Okay, moving on to our next voice.
02:28:39 Guys, I've been waiting for this one.
02:28:40 This is my favorite voicemail of the bunch.
02:28:43 I am so excited to share it with you.
02:28:45 This comes from,
02:28:46 I hope someone who becomes a staple on this episode,
02:28:49 or on this podcast.
02:28:50 All right, all right, here we go.
02:28:51 I give you this, dude.
02:28:52 The one and only, the fall hype guy.
02:28:55 Go.
02:28:57 Bro, it's fall.
02:28:58 That means there's fairs and festivals and...
02:29:02 I'm about to watch figure eight derby racing,
02:29:05 and it's going to be intense.
02:29:07 I've been eating nothing but junk food all day long,
02:29:10 including no freaking ostrich burger, dude.
02:29:14 What's your favorite part of fall?
02:29:20 Incredible.
02:29:21 Oh, come on, that was good.
02:29:23 He's so hyped about fall.
02:29:25 Yeah, that's what I don't like.
02:29:25 It's infectious.
02:29:27 It's infectious.
02:29:28 I hope it's ironic.
02:29:29 If it's ironic, I like it.
02:29:31 That was a budget munchie.
02:29:32 That was okay.
02:29:34 Oh, you guys, your standards are too fucking high.
02:29:36 Nate, your problem is that you hyped it up.
02:29:39 If you had just let it play,
02:29:40 we probably would have been much more invested.
02:29:41 Are you fucking fall, Stan?
02:29:44 I love fall, yeah.
02:29:45 You know what it reminds me of?
02:29:46 It reminds me of that very beginning
02:29:50 of Poo's Grand Adventure,
02:29:51 where they say,
02:29:52 on the last day of a golden summer,
02:29:54 a boy and a bear were hanging out
02:29:56 as some fucking adventure was about to dawn.
02:29:59 They say hanging out.
02:30:00 They say about to fucking stuck around.
02:30:04 They do say that.
02:30:05 I remember that.
02:30:06 That language, that flowery British language.
02:30:09 Ooh, it gets me every time.
02:30:11 Okay, well, I, for one, can't wait to fall hype guy.
02:30:14 I wouldn't mind fall, except that people go fucking weird for it.
02:30:18 I want to hear from this guy every three months.
02:30:20 I enjoy autumn quite a lot.
02:30:22 Because of the sort of gray.
02:30:24 Pumpkins.
02:30:25 Like the grayness of the outside,
02:30:28 but it's not cold enough to not take a walk.
02:30:30 So it's sort of a unique time.
02:30:33 The leaves are starting to fall.
02:30:34 They're picturesque in the eastern seaboard in America.
02:30:38 Oh, that's why they call it fall.
02:30:41 Because the leaves do it.
02:30:44 Probably.
02:30:44 Why do they call it winter?
02:30:45 Because that wind sure does turd.
02:30:46 Because it's epic wind, bro.
02:30:48 Or why do they call it summer?
02:30:50 What does that have to do with anything?
02:30:52 I want to get some of these nuts in my face.
02:30:57 That's what I'm talking about.
02:30:58 Anyway, call back in three months.
02:31:00 I can't wait to hear from winter hype guy,
02:31:02 and then spring hype guy, and then summer hype guy.
02:31:05 I'll be tired of the bit by then.
02:31:08 It'll be fresh.
02:31:08 It'll be mostly.
02:31:09 It'll be fresh again in however life.
02:31:12 We're all still alive at that point.
02:31:14 I'll say to that voice, I'll say hello, fresh.
02:31:16 Guys, no, climate change.
02:31:17 Seasons are fucking over.
02:31:18 We're all going to fucking die.
02:31:20 That's true.
02:31:20 All right.
02:31:21 We had a good run.
02:31:22 Here's a question.
02:31:22 If the seasons got locked,
02:31:24 which season would you want it to be forever?
02:31:27 I got to go with spring, I think.
02:31:29 I got to go with spring.
02:31:29 I mean, I like spring.
02:31:30 I like South Coruble bloom.
02:31:32 I like winter.
02:31:33 I think winter is aesthetic, but I'd get sick of it real fast.
02:31:36 Winter is fucking miserable.
02:31:38 Yeah, I got to go.
02:31:39 I like spring too.
02:31:40 Spring, maybe summer.
02:31:41 But summer's kind of fucking hot.
02:31:43 I want late spring.
02:31:44 It's all about spring.
02:31:45 It's all about spring.
02:31:46 If I had to, it's not my, yeah.
02:31:48 If you had to.
02:31:49 Gibber, are you a spring boy too, Gibber?
02:31:51 Imagine if it was winter forever.
02:31:52 Think of the practical implications of this question.
02:31:56 Well, I mean, there is one thing is that in spring,
02:31:59 there's a lot of pollen in the air, and I have hay fever.
02:32:02 So I sneeze way more than during winter, during spring.
02:32:06 Unironically, when I think about the seasons locking,
02:32:08 I unironically just want to center it around.
02:32:11 I've actually been studying this a little bit about,
02:32:13 did you guys know that the Sakura blossoms
02:32:15 in the land of the Surizing Sun, Nipon, they only bloom,
02:32:18 not even for like all of spring,
02:32:21 but literally for like, there's like a 10 day period.
02:32:23 And actually, the progression of the blooming
02:32:26 of the Sakura trees, it progresses,
02:32:28 and different areas have different days regularly
02:32:31 throughout the year.
02:32:32 So you can actually kind of follow the progression
02:32:34 of the Sakura blossoms from east to west, I think,
02:32:37 along Japan.
02:32:39 I've been looking into it for a potential trip in the spring.
02:32:42 So we'll see what happens with that.
02:32:44 Ooh, I love Japan, period.
02:32:46 Okay, but anyway.
02:32:47 Disgusting.
02:32:48 Next up, it is gross.
02:32:49 I apologize, everyone.
02:32:50 Next up, we've got IRL Riddle My Ass Batman story.
02:32:55 No joke.
02:32:56 No joke.
02:32:57 So welcome back, Mr. Batman.
02:32:59 Do you know the black man of Joker fame?
02:33:02 I'd be curious.
02:33:04 Okay, let's go.
02:33:05 Go.
02:33:05 Hello, PCB.
02:33:06 Riddle My Ass Batman here.
02:33:07 First I have a question.
02:33:08 An IRL story, Rintangely.
02:33:10 Related to that question.
02:33:11 Question.
02:33:12 Are you doing it in October?
02:33:12 I've done it in the past and failed this year.
02:33:15 I made it two days before missing one.
02:33:16 Don't worry, I have a good reason.
02:33:18 Okay, story time.
02:33:19 I'm walking over the bridge.
02:33:20 On my way to work, I get off the bridge, talk to my buddy.
02:33:22 Not my buddy, it turns out.
02:33:24 Next thing I know, I feel a big wop in the back of my head.
02:33:27 Everything goes black.
02:33:28 The next part of the story, I don't really remember.
02:33:30 I have to piece together from what other people told me.
02:33:32 I wake up on the railroad tracks.
02:33:33 I have complete amnesia.
02:33:35 No wallet, no glasses, and phone broken.
02:33:38 Happened to stumble my way into a police station
02:33:40 via the train tracks.
02:33:42 After that, they ID me.
02:33:44 Talked to me on the hot team to the hospital.
02:33:46 No brain damage.
02:33:47 Talked to my family.
02:33:48 They tell me to bombard me with information.
02:33:50 Hopefully jogging my memory.
02:33:52 What does a little, and what jog memory?
02:33:54 Not in my family photos or anything like that.
02:33:56 What happened to jog memory is a little story called,
02:33:59 a little video called by Joseph Jostar,
02:34:02 called Entire Riddle My Ass Gavance Saga.
02:34:05 I said my memories come back to me
02:34:06 and I felt like I was taking a PCV.
02:34:09 Anyway, I started even told her as soon as I remember
02:34:10 how to jog again.
02:34:12 What happened to my next life?
02:34:13 Turned the next time to find out.
02:34:14 Same PCV time, same PCV channel.
02:34:18 Yeah, all right.
02:34:20 He said this was IRL.
02:34:23 He said no joke, but surely there must be joke.
02:34:28 I really like the idea that the story starts
02:34:30 when he goes on a bridge, talks to a friend,
02:34:32 turns out he's not his friend, then he gets knocked out.
02:34:36 Who is this mysterious character?
02:34:38 Yeah, I want to know about that guy.
02:34:39 Perhaps that was Riddle My Ass.
02:34:40 Maybe that was Joe, Joe, Joe, Jostar.
02:34:42 You know?
02:34:43 Maybe that was Joseph Jostar.
02:34:44 Maybe that was Black Man.
02:34:46 That could have been Black Man.
02:34:47 He sees Riddle My Ass Batman in Fringe of his Turf,
02:34:50 his copyright.
02:34:52 That would make sense.
02:34:54 I am not doing Inktober because I...
02:34:58 Well, I wouldn't have done it anyway,
02:34:59 because I don't like it.
02:35:00 I don't do traditional drawing very much,
02:35:03 so I know I would fail at it,
02:35:05 and I don't accept the legitimacy
02:35:07 of digital drawing for Inktober.
02:35:08 I think it's down when people are like,
02:35:10 oh, digital ink counts, I don't agree.
02:35:12 Stupid.
02:35:14 That's fair.
02:35:14 Fight me in the comments.
02:35:16 This is like Never Paint's time to shine, though,
02:35:18 because Never Paint always does
02:35:20 like IRL shit or whatever.
02:35:22 Go, Never Paint.
02:35:24 And I wouldn't do it anyway,
02:35:25 because I'm doing my fucking Phantom Horn comic,
02:35:30 and if I'm going to be drawn,
02:35:31 I want to be working on that.
02:35:33 Makes sense to me.
02:35:34 I'm doing Devtober, obviously,
02:35:35 so that's different.
02:35:36 Indeed.
02:35:37 Monthtober is the most viable.
02:35:39 It really is.
02:35:40 I feel like it's a new movement
02:35:42 that really needs to pick up some steam.
02:35:46 Nate, you doing Inktober?
02:35:47 I'm doing, no, just no, just absolutely not.
02:35:50 Are you doing like worktober?
02:35:52 I'm doing the same amount of worktober
02:35:55 I would do under the given month.
02:35:57 Nate's doing work supposedly,
02:35:58 but we don't see any results of it.
02:35:59 I'm making my weeagwas.
02:36:01 They're basically weekly at this point,
02:36:03 and that's great.
02:36:04 I'm chugging along, and I've had enough time
02:36:07 to work on other stuff,
02:36:08 so new videos of me, you'll see.
02:36:10 You know what?
02:36:12 By the time, I always say it by the time,
02:36:14 no, don't say it.
02:36:15 Don't say it.
02:36:16 Nate, a new video, we'll be out.
02:36:19 That's not even a weeagwa on my channel.
02:36:22 Don't say it.
02:36:23 Oh my gosh.
02:36:23 This is like my N-word.
02:36:24 This is my, you know, it's mine.
02:36:26 Don't say it, Nate.
02:36:27 Don't say it.
02:36:28 I'm saying it.
02:36:29 I'm saying it.
02:36:30 You'll be able to judge.
02:36:31 You'll be able to mock me mercilessly
02:36:33 wherever you please, if not.
02:36:34 I mean, again, it's lost its edge
02:36:36 when we can do it constantly.
02:36:38 He's going to say the C-word, content.
02:36:40 Yeah, there it is.
02:36:41 There it is.
02:36:42 We'll see.
02:36:42 Or the N-word, new content.
02:36:44 New, the N-C, yeah.
02:36:45 Well, you'll be the judge, folks.
02:36:47 Let me know.
02:36:47 Let me know if my thing is out when you hear this.
02:36:50 Okay, here we go.
02:36:51 Next up, we've only got a few left.
02:36:53 We've got Peter Griffin watches the PCP.
02:36:56 Oh man, what I've always been waiting for.
02:36:58 Okay, here we go.
02:36:59 Peter.
02:37:00 I'm just patron to the PCP.
02:37:05 Peter, did you ever have the last time you looked at the PCP?
02:37:10 Hey, Lois, I'm going to vape and smoke weed
02:37:13 while arguing about politics and my little pony.
02:37:19 It's Sans Peter Griffin.
02:37:23 That's how it happened.
02:37:24 That's the, that's Sans Peter Griffin's backstory.
02:37:27 That's his backstory.
02:37:28 Listen to the PCP.
02:37:30 He vape and smoked weed while doing something else
02:37:33 that I forget and then he turned on the PCP.
02:37:34 Vaping and MLP and politics.
02:37:37 The story started way with-
02:37:37 Arguable politics and MLP.
02:37:39 It was like, oh fuck, what's that movie?
02:37:42 They reviewed it on Red Letter Media about Dom Delouise
02:37:44 as the voice of the super skateboard, the intelligent skateboard.
02:37:48 Yeah, I forget, but yeah.
02:37:49 And just like this confluence of weird events
02:37:52 just happened to create this super,
02:37:53 it was like a lightning strike and all these like computer chips
02:37:56 and like some other, like you wished upon a star or something.
02:38:00 And the combination of these events just happened to create
02:38:02 Dom Delouise, the magic skateboard.
02:38:04 That it's the same with all these things coming together
02:38:07 to create Sans Peter Griffin.
02:38:09 That's, that's uh, that's a bit.
02:38:11 That story started with someone pledging to the PCP patron.
02:38:16 So like, I mean already-
02:38:17 Let that be an example for all of you right there.
02:38:19 So it was, it started at the happy end
02:38:21 and it was downhill from there.
02:38:24 It was a story of false and grace.
02:38:28 All right, next up we've got, oh, this is a good one.
02:38:31 The grammar fascist is calling in.
02:38:33 So truly an enemy to our friends and communists.
02:38:36 Tell, let's see what he has to say.
02:38:37 Yeah.
02:38:38 All right, I'm mad.
02:38:40 Anytime I try and tell someone they're a fucking dumbass
02:38:42 because they use the wrong there or they're on your,
02:38:44 and that doesn't make them a fucking dumbass, by the way.
02:38:46 They always try to tell me, uh,
02:38:47 you're just to be able to not see languages
02:38:49 whenever people make it out to be.
02:38:50 No, fuck off.
02:38:52 People act like there's no objective effect.
02:38:54 That's just wrong.
02:38:55 Everyone knows the whole helping your uncle Jack off a horse
02:38:57 and helping your uncle Jack off a horse thing by now.
02:39:00 It does actually do something other than just make the eyes
02:39:02 belonging to anyone with any common sense bleed.
02:39:05 Everyone knows this, but they always respond with a,
02:39:07 oh, that really makes a difference.
02:39:08 It's probably not gonna actually change the meaning
02:39:10 even though it could.
02:39:11 That's what I have to say.
02:39:13 And maybe you're right.
02:39:14 It usually won't.
02:39:15 But when you're proven you're so goddamn stupid
02:39:17 you can't figure out when you're even supposed
02:39:18 to use an apostrophe.
02:39:19 How can I trust you to know when your grammar mistake will
02:39:22 and won't actually matter?
02:39:24 The people who actually know the rules of grammar
02:39:26 will know when they can afford to post a typo
02:39:27 or not bother thinking about which word to use
02:39:29 because they actually understand the rules grammar works by.
02:39:32 And that's fine.
02:39:32 It's not annoying when that happens,
02:39:34 but the people who always make this argument
02:39:35 are the ones who can't even figure out which word
02:39:36 or common placement or colon placement is correct.
02:39:39 There's no fucking way for you to figure out
02:39:40 if your mistake will change the meaning or not
02:39:42 if you haven't bothered to learn the rules.
02:39:43 But no, they just always try and make these arguments
02:39:45 because they're so goddamn insecure
02:39:47 about the grammatical incompetence
02:39:48 that they feel when you do it so anyone who points it out.
02:39:52 It's real straight.
02:39:53 You make a good case, grammar fascist.
02:39:55 Yeah, fuck him.
02:39:56 Yeah, like, of course.
02:39:58 Yeah, of course there are grammar rules.
02:40:01 I mean, grammar is an authoritarian system, so.
02:40:05 It's true.
02:40:06 It's true.
02:40:07 Who's to say?
02:40:08 I guess I'll be a grammar fascist too.
02:40:10 That's, I'll do it.
02:40:12 Yeah, I'll do it.
02:40:13 No, that's the one time that it's cool.
02:40:15 It's way cool.
02:40:16 I hope we get a call in from Bash the Grammar Fash next episode.
02:40:19 I hope that.
02:40:20 I look forward to that.
02:40:21 I hope, well, I guess they don't need grammar
02:40:24 when they're speaking.
02:40:27 No, not really.
02:40:28 Well, wait, in the spoken word, there are no rules
02:40:31 and everyone's just making it up
02:40:33 and it all, nothing matters and there's no God.
02:40:35 Well, I assume grammar is like, yeah, the commas and stuff
02:40:39 and those denote like pauses in speech or like.
02:40:44 Well, grammar is also like nouns and vowels and adjectives.
02:40:48 Okay, well, as long as he just speaks like an idiot,
02:40:52 then it would be fine.
02:40:54 Agreed.
02:40:55 All right, we compromise on that.
02:40:57 Don't learn your thays.
02:40:58 Learn your thays and theirs and stuff.
02:41:01 Like, I really don't know how people don't know them.
02:41:06 It's not even that difficult.
02:41:08 They just, I mean, I mean, it would be annoying, right?
02:41:11 Like, if you make a mistake, like that's,
02:41:13 if you make a mistake, it's a mistake and like, but yeah,
02:41:17 I would be annoyed too if you say like,
02:41:20 hey, use the wrong there.
02:41:21 I mean, you could be in, you could do it in an annoying way,
02:41:24 right?
02:41:24 And they would say like, dude, you're just being,
02:41:26 you're nitpicking, you're being pedantic.
02:41:27 Like, who cares?
02:41:28 Like, you know what I meant.
02:41:29 Like, and that would be fair.
02:41:30 But if they're like, no, there aren't any actual rules, man.
02:41:34 Like, then they're just wrong.
02:41:35 Well, yeah, yeah.
02:41:36 And both can be true at once.
02:41:37 You can both be an asshole and they're actually wrong.
02:41:40 So, sure.
02:41:40 Fair enough.
02:41:41 All right, let's move on.
02:41:42 Our last voicemail.
02:41:43 Our last voicemail, everybody.
02:41:46 This is from, okay, here we go.
02:41:47 This is from The Cuck of Monte Pisto.
02:41:51 Formerly, formerly, well-researched thesis
02:41:53 who has been locked away in the voice jail where they belong.
02:41:56 So, okay, let's.
02:41:57 What was their well-researched thesis again?
02:41:59 You want to remind me?
02:42:00 Wasn't that about things being human core or not?
02:42:03 And I think they said, like, the bathroom thing.
02:42:05 Oh, okay.
02:42:06 It was terrible.
02:42:06 It was terrible.
02:42:06 Yep, yep.
02:42:07 I think that was them.
02:42:08 I could be wrong.
02:42:09 Let me know.
02:42:09 Okay, let's hear what they have to say from the jail.
02:42:11 Go.
02:42:12 So, I'm sitting here at a disgrace caller in the voice jail,
02:42:15 getting my daily lashes.
02:42:16 And I get to thinking,
02:42:17 how is an unfunny cuck such as myself
02:42:20 going to free himself from the voice jail?
02:42:22 And it hits me.
02:42:22 Yeah.
02:42:23 I'll suck mage's dick.
02:42:24 Wait, no, that won't work.
02:42:25 That's gay.
02:42:26 Yeah?
02:42:26 I'll suck mage's dick.
02:42:28 Wait, shit.
02:42:28 I'm pretty sure that got eaten out by piranhas.
02:42:30 Well, fuck.
02:42:32 There's no other choice left for me.
02:42:34 I have to use my last resort.
02:42:36 Go to patreon.com slash the pro-crasinators to support the show.
02:42:39 $1 gets you access to the Patreon Discord
02:42:41 and $5 gets you access to the bonus episode.
02:42:43 And a currently undetermined amount
02:42:45 gets you access to the Minecraft server.
02:42:47 I'm donating right now.
02:42:48 harass me in the Patreon Discord.
02:42:50 Oh.
02:42:50 You can recognize me as the cuck of Monty Pisto.
02:42:53 But I won't be patroning for long.
02:42:55 It's hard for voice jail convicts to find works these days.
02:42:58 And send in your voicemail, people.
02:43:00 If my shitty bits can get played on the show,
02:43:02 yours can.
02:43:02 Yours certainly can do better.
02:43:04 Listen to that shitty audio quality.
02:43:07 I'm calling for my phone.
02:43:08 This is like take 20.
02:43:10 Yeah.
02:43:10 Link to the speak pipe is in the description.
02:43:13 Oh, here come the guards now.
02:43:15 It worked.
02:43:15 I'm free.
02:43:16 Oh, no, wait.
02:43:17 What are they doing with those billy clubs?
02:43:22 Getting too uppity.
02:43:23 Getting too fucking uppity.
02:43:24 It's me.
02:43:24 It's me.
02:43:25 I'm the jailer of the PC.
02:43:27 Whatever it is.
02:43:28 I'll leave him alone.
02:43:29 Oh, no, he's good.
02:43:30 Are we freeing him?
02:43:31 Are we freeing him?
02:43:32 Did you notice?
02:43:32 Did you notice how he got a little uppity there?
02:43:34 He's like putting that vague thread of like,
02:43:36 oh, why am I in voice jail?
02:43:38 I can't earn money to give to the Patreon.
02:43:40 No, no, no, no, no.
02:43:42 It's worse than that.
02:43:43 He said he's not going to patron for long.
02:43:44 Because now it's even if the convicts can't,
02:43:47 convicts can't, and he's still a convict even to let him out.
02:43:50 So there's no hope.
02:43:52 There's no point letting him out.
02:43:53 Because if you let him out, he still doesn't have any money.
02:43:54 So what doesn't matter.
02:43:55 I mean, I think he's right.
02:43:58 If we can't squeeze his wallet, we'll squeeze his skull.
02:44:02 He's right where he needs to be, as far as I can say.
02:44:04 He's right where he needs to be.
02:44:06 This feels right.
02:44:06 You're right.
02:44:07 And thank him for doing the heavy lifting.
02:44:09 Now that we're at the end of this episode,
02:44:10 you heard it from the cuck of Monty Pisto.
02:44:13 Go harass him in the PCP Patreon Discord.
02:44:16 We'll give him an extra jello cup at his next weekly meal.
02:44:20 Yeah, that seems fair.
02:44:23 Yeah, so there you go.
02:44:24 Patreon.com slash theprocrastinators.
02:44:27 You heard it, $1 Discord, $5 bonus episodes.
02:44:30 New one is out.
02:44:31 New one is out.
02:44:31 That's 30 episodes now.
