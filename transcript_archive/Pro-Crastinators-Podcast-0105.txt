00:00:00 The Pro Crastinators Podcast
00:00:30 We're on the PCP. It's an internet show. It's a podcast. You know it is. It's me, Munchy.
00:00:48 We have Digi here. We have Danger Boy. It's the best guy's ever new character. It's Danger Boy.
00:01:01 Hello, everyone. I'm currently falling at light speed from the top of a skyscraper headed towards the ground.
00:01:08 That's where I'll be reporting in for this entire podcast, so I'll send you updates periodically.
00:01:13 He's going so fast that rubber bands, the point where he can do an entire podcast, will take something to himself.
00:01:18 Yeah, that's right. Time has slowed down because I'm approaching the speed of light or something.
00:01:22 That's so dangerous. I love the editing.
00:01:24 Yeah, it's pretty good.
00:01:26 Hippo, it's you.
00:01:29 My drug of choice is tea.
00:01:31 Rayman. When's Rayman 2? Come on, let's be serious.
00:01:35 That's my drug.
00:01:36 Let's get serious. We were all choking around, but come on.
00:01:40 I need to get pretty high for that.
00:01:43 We have been.
00:01:49 Fuck. I'm not dangerous at all.
00:01:53 Oh, my God. It's Danger Boy Sidekick Mild Lad.
00:02:00 Oh, no. I don't want to see what you're going to do, Master.
00:02:05 I can't look.
00:02:07 He's a slave.
00:02:09 I'm just a boy. I can't take the weapons.
00:02:12 Today, on the podcast, there was politically correct, morally aligned, conventionally socially acceptable podcasts on the internet.
00:02:21 We're talking about fucking weed.
00:02:24 Drugs, this is not just the weed podcast, except it literally is just going to be the weed podcast.
00:02:29 We all know it's coming. We all know that's just what is going to happen.
00:02:32 I decided that on the off chance that this was supposed to be an intervention,
00:02:37 because I was had a sneaking suspicion you were just going to pull an intervention on me,
00:02:42 so I thought the funniest way that could happen is if I was showed up as high as humanly possible.
00:02:47 And that bomb rip I took at the start of the show just now was so heavy that I thought I was hallucinating
00:02:53 what Nate was saying in his intro, because I thought it was too funny to be real.
00:02:59 What an endorsement.
00:03:02 The Urban Dictionary for drugs is so fucking long, and it's like a realized Wikipedia article.
00:03:11 I don't have time for this shit.
00:03:13 The beginning part is pretty good. Just that first little paragraph there.
00:03:16 Drugs are chemicals that alter, block, or mimic chemical reactions in the brain.
00:03:22 This causes an alteration of the body's normal processes,
00:03:26 causing physical, faster heartbeat, deeper respiratory diseases,
00:03:31 and so on, hedgehog bubbles, etc.
00:03:34 The fact that the fucking Urban Dictionary article is like this is funny.
00:03:38 It's like a parody of itself, because it's making fun of how, in a way,
00:03:43 how people who are into drugs get extremely serious when it comes to the topic of defending drugs.
00:03:50 There's no means. It's just like, oh no, we need to give you all the science,
00:03:55 because like...
00:03:56 It's like enough joking around, enough joking around.
00:03:59 Yeah, put on the suits, and we like, you know, quaff our hair back.
00:04:02 We have a lot of fun here on Urban Dictionary, but this is important.
00:04:05 Far better of description is the definition for weed.
00:04:10 God's gift to the world brings peace released wisely past the blunt dude,
00:04:16 but they take sums up all of our opinions quite nicely.
00:04:21 Just for the record, I think it's, we've done this before,
00:04:23 but let's just read off, of course, our entire podcast is drug-themed to begin with,
00:04:27 so we are the PCP, and PCP, aka Angel Dust, is, again, we've read this before,
00:04:33 it is the scariest of all drugs, according to Urban Dictionary,
00:04:37 was used as a horse tranquilizer, makes the user hallucinate,
00:04:40 become extremely violent, and not feel anything.
00:04:42 People have been known to do horrible things to themselves,
00:04:44 while under the influence of PCP, do not use the PCP, it will ruin your life.
00:04:48 Yeah, it definitely is, like, a drug that is highly destructive,
00:04:52 and I am a huge fan of PCP as a joke because of the whitest kids-you-know skit,
00:04:59 a gallon of PCP, which is one of my favorite skits of all time,
00:05:03 so when we had the opportunity to be called the PCP, I jumped on it for those reasons.
00:05:07 When we're gonna get PCP brand soda, and exclusively sell them non-two liters,
00:05:11 or like bottles, but in gallons.
00:05:13 Oh, that would be fucking awesome, that's genius!
00:05:16 We gotta make a PCP drink!
00:05:18 Oh, shit! I feel like this is really doable!
00:05:22 It's just a gallon of munchies pee.
00:05:25 Oh, Jesus Christ.
00:05:27 Oh, again, doable.
00:05:28 That would make sense, yeah, it's still doable.
00:05:30 We just have munchies, buy gallon bottles of water,
00:05:34 build up with piss and mail to the people, that's totally normal.
00:05:37 Dude, you've seen how much piss I can piss,
00:05:39 like all the times I piss on the show, I do it in like two McDonald's large cups.
00:05:44 Yeah, I've seen the piss cups, they're fucking...
00:05:47 Munchie, we could actually, like, I feel like there's some people who would buy this,
00:05:50 you have to be 18 before we can sell your piss, probably,
00:05:53 but I feel like...
00:05:54 Probably.
00:05:55 And I don't know what the tax is on me sending that much liquid, but, you know...
00:05:59 Once I reach 18, there's gonna be so many content, like, opportunities,
00:06:03 there's gonna be so many new things, like once I'm 18...
00:06:05 Oh, no, dick is gonna be everywhere, like...
00:06:07 I know!
00:06:08 You know, you guys saw a lot of Eric Andre's dick,
00:06:11 wait till you see fucking Munchies, like, I'm 18 now.
00:06:14 That's come up later this fucking year,
00:06:16 get fucking ready for that shit.
00:06:17 And with all these restrictions and limitations happening on YouTube in general,
00:06:23 and it seems like the weight of the world is shifting towards Pornhub
00:06:27 as, like, the main uploading site for, like, most of the world,
00:06:30 so I just think that in the years to come,
00:06:32 we're gonna be seeing a lot of Munchie content on Pornhub,
00:06:34 just, you know, regardless of the context within.
00:06:37 Yeah.
00:06:38 It's an exciting future.
00:06:40 I really hope that's the world we're heading for,
00:06:42 is where, like, Pornh is just into...
00:06:45 I mean, I always thought it's a little weird,
00:06:47 and when you think about it, that YouTube has banned Pornh,
00:06:51 because if Pornh and other videos were on the same website,
00:06:55 like, it would be more convenient for everybody,
00:06:57 the only problem is that people don't want to present themselves as having...
00:07:01 You know, we wanna keep those identities separated for social reasons,
00:07:04 but if we didn't have that social barrier,
00:07:06 if, like, sex and porn were, like, just acceptable things to talk about,
00:07:10 like, there would be no reason not to integrate those.
00:07:13 Well, what's that one...
00:07:15 It's, like, that video on YouTube that's, like,
00:07:17 see a penis inside of a vagina,
00:07:19 the one where it's just, like, a straight-up, like,
00:07:21 documentary of what it looks like to come inside a vagina.
00:07:24 That's pretty cool.
00:07:25 I'm gonna go watch that right now.
00:07:27 I'm pulling it off.
00:07:29 Show notes, everybody. Show notes.
00:07:32 The future of PCB is all of us in a sauna with no towels on.
00:07:36 We're just pure, fucking, unadulteratedly naked,
00:07:39 and we're doing the podcast from within a sauna.
00:07:41 Our bodies are glistening. That's coming up in, like, two years.
00:07:45 All right.
00:07:46 It's fucking set to porn music, and it looks...
00:07:49 I mean, this is great.
00:07:51 All right, all right, yeah, it's actually pretty good.
00:07:53 We already did that.
00:07:54 Let's start off with the podcast with a very important thing.
00:07:58 Who here is straight edge?
00:08:00 I'm straight edge.
00:08:02 Define straight.
00:08:04 Yeah, please define.
00:08:06 I kind of wish I was.
00:08:08 Well, hang on. Let me pull up fucking straight edge on UrbanDictionary.com.
00:08:12 No, let me do this. I know the history of it,
00:08:14 because straight edge comes from the hardcore punk scene in music,
00:08:18 where certain punk bands, because the members of the band were so young,
00:08:23 they had the X's on their hand that meant they couldn't drink,
00:08:26 and some of them took it as, like, an identity thing.
00:08:28 It's like, well, we don't, like, we are an anti-drug band anyways,
00:08:32 so people started wearing those X's on their hands
00:08:34 and calling themselves straight edge in, like, straight edge punk
00:08:37 was like a subcategory, basically.
00:08:39 Dude, that's like the punk version of those, like, purity rings
00:08:43 that, like, Mormon kids wear and shit.
00:08:46 All right, cool, cool.
00:08:47 But that's what to be straight edge.
00:08:49 Traditionally, to say, like, oh, you are straight edge,
00:08:51 in, like, either, like, rap or punk is usually...
00:08:54 So would you say it's like a mental thing
00:08:57 rather than a literal, like, I have not imbibed any of these things?
00:09:01 Yeah, it's more like choosing, yeah, it's more of an identity thing.
00:09:05 Because I have technically done one weed,
00:09:07 and I have done a lot of drink of alcohols.
00:09:10 I don't know whether that's covered in this book.
00:09:12 That's very much not straight edge.
00:09:14 Catch me in the garden out back doing all the weed,
00:09:17 pulling them, planting them, just going nuts on those weeds.
00:09:20 I did so much fucking weed, my lawn was barren for two years afterwards.
00:09:24 All that grass was gone and inside of my stomach and lungs.
00:09:28 Well, yeah, all right, all right, but the good question.
00:09:31 So who is straight edge here?
00:09:32 I would pretty much define myself as basically straight edge,
00:09:35 for the most part.
00:09:37 But you drink alcohol.
00:09:39 Well, but, like, so rarely.
00:09:41 Like, at Radcon 3, I don't think I drank a single drop of alcohol
00:09:45 the entire time, and it's because I just don't care.
00:09:47 I mean, we didn't have that much to me.
00:09:49 That's true.
00:09:50 To me, getting drunk or whatever is just like a distraction.
00:09:54 All I am, what gets me high in this life, it's 100% true,
00:09:58 is achieving my goals and getting work done.
00:10:01 That's all I care about or want to do.
00:10:03 You don't need to get high to have fun.
00:10:07 All you need to do is achieve your goals.
00:10:10 But I will tell you though, I will tell you though,
00:10:12 I wouldn't say I'm 100% straight edge, you know, like clinically,
00:10:16 because I do two great drugs.
00:10:19 One is caffeine.
00:10:20 I've started drinking coffee, basically every day.
00:10:23 Not much.
00:10:24 Well, that's the thing.
00:10:25 I'm currently consuming the two drugs of choice in my life right now.
00:10:29 One is caffeine, which isn't really that big a deal.
00:10:31 The other is probably the most insidious drug on the face of the earth.
00:10:35 It is a nightmare.
00:10:36 It is ruining society.
00:10:37 Esther Jackson.
00:10:39 No, it is sugar.
00:10:41 I am currently consuming a gigantic pudding cup I bought from Whole Foods,
00:10:46 specifically for this podcast.
00:10:48 Listen to me.
00:10:49 Alright, Nate, you get to be straight edge.
00:10:51 You're allowed to be straight edge because of this faggot ass thing
00:10:54 you're saying at the moment.
00:10:56 Hippo, I know you drink and do it with me.
00:11:00 I do drink on occasion when it's like a party
00:11:05 and it's like, well, I need something in my hand, so I may as well.
00:11:09 So I don't have a cock, so I'll take a beer.
00:11:11 That'll work instead.
00:11:12 I mean, that would be kind of cumbersome
00:11:15 to hold some guy's dick in that way.
00:11:18 You'd have to coordinate your movements really well.
00:11:22 Would they be like...
00:11:25 Well, you arrange a big circle where it rotates around
00:11:28 and everyone gets visited like the part of the table
00:11:31 with the snacks that they want, but okay, go ahead.
00:11:33 Do you want me to do a Patreon if you're a gay male?
00:11:37 Just do it.
00:11:38 Patreon Skyrockets.
00:11:42 As literally everyone in the audience thinks, wow, that was just for me.
00:11:47 I think what I would define as straight edge is like,
00:11:51 if there's no reason, but you still think,
00:11:54 yeah, I'll have a drink, then you're not straight edge.
00:11:56 Or I'll have a smoke.
00:11:58 Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.
00:12:00 Yeah, yeah.
00:12:01 If there's no societal pressure on you,
00:12:03 if there's no advantage other than I'm bored
00:12:06 and I just feel like it, then yeah.
00:12:08 So I guess I'm not straight edge,
00:12:10 because I have drunk on streams and just generally.
00:12:14 Yeah, I guess so.
00:12:16 So there's words of you drinking that I can give to the police.
00:12:18 Yes, I am under 12 years old.
00:12:21 There's degrees of straight edge and I guess being not straight edge.
00:12:25 No, there's fucking not.
00:12:26 That's the whole point.
00:12:27 Being straight edge is like an absolute identity commitment.
00:12:30 But I mean, but I do once in a while like you.
00:12:32 Then you're not fucking straight edge.
00:12:33 You fall short.
00:12:34 I mean, for what it's worth.
00:12:36 No, you're like that guy in Scott Pilgrim who ate the chicken parmesan
00:12:40 and there's not vegan anymore.
00:12:42 Can we address the fact that Nate is staunchly anti-identitarian
00:12:45 in the first place and therefore should not even begin to describe himself
00:12:49 as straight edge when it's like an exclusively,
00:12:52 the term exists for identitarian purposes.
00:12:54 It's like, I mean, yeah, I guess so.
00:12:56 For practical purposes.
00:12:57 So we can identify how much people care about drugs in the course of this podcast.
00:13:01 I mean, I would describe the origin of it as very similar
00:13:04 to the origin of the term social justice warrior
00:13:06 when like they actually called themselves that
00:13:09 and then eventually like people started in the same way that people
00:13:13 not call people.
00:13:14 Oh, you're like straight edge because they're trying to say basically
00:13:17 we're not going to invite you to a party because you think you're boring.
00:13:20 I feel like there is a practical usage of the word here
00:13:22 that just means someone who doesn't consume like drugs or alcohol on a regular basis.
00:13:27 I mean, is there another word that I should use instead for that?
00:13:31 Like clean?
00:13:32 Just say I don't drink because I fucking care about my body.
00:13:36 That's like at least two more words.
00:13:39 Here's how it is.
00:13:41 If you don't do it, if you don't do it on the regular,
00:13:44 if you just do it very, very occasionally, then you're straight edge.
00:13:48 I would say the health nut.
00:13:50 Because that's the core reason he's not drinking.
00:13:53 If you do it like mildly to all the time, you are bent.
00:13:56 You know, it's funny that you say I'm a health nut.
00:13:59 In my mind, to all the actual health nuts out there,
00:14:02 I'm an embarrassment and a disgrace that I'm even eating sugar right now.
00:14:06 You own cans of beans at all.
00:14:08 That is to be a health nut.
00:14:10 Every time we go grocery shopping, we come home and immediately eat a Lunchables.
00:14:15 That is the first thing that happens.
00:14:17 Okay, so you see, men of your lifestyle live in the depths of depravity.
00:14:22 You can't even fathom how high the ceiling is, how high the ceiling can go.
00:14:26 My parents are vegans, so I absolutely know where the ceiling can go.
00:14:32 But you can still eat sugar though, and sugar is death.
00:14:37 I want to ask you though, Nate, if you had given up on your body,
00:14:43 if you decided you were like, oh, I can't be passionate about this anymore
00:14:47 for whatever reason, something else is more important,
00:14:49 do you think you would take up casual drinking?
00:14:52 Well, no, because the reason I don't drink is specifically because
00:14:56 it just is like a night waster, in my opinion.
00:15:00 What if you were in a situation where you had to waste the nights though?
00:15:04 There was no choice.
00:15:06 Yeah, if the night is just...
00:15:08 I'm at a Christmas party, and I'm there just to hang out,
00:15:11 and I can't even work if I want to.
00:15:13 At that point, there's no reason not to drink, so I would probably consider it.
00:15:16 What if things were different, and the reason why you don't like something
00:15:18 didn't exist, would you do it then?
00:15:20 No, I mean, that's the real...
00:15:22 When I go to visit my parents around Christmas time,
00:15:25 I can't even do work if I want to,
00:15:27 so there's no reason to not drink, so I'm much more likely to do so.
00:15:31 The reason I'm saying this, Munchie, is that I want to characterize him
00:15:34 as it's more about his health and his productivity,
00:15:38 whereas I feel like people who are sincerely straight-edge
00:15:41 would not have drank even if they had to waste the night
00:15:44 because they are against the existence of these drugs.
00:15:48 That used to be me, I'm not like that anymore.
00:15:50 When I was a kid, I was legitimately scared of alcohol,
00:15:53 but we'll talk about that later.
00:15:55 I thought of the thing, we've got straight-edge, which is that,
00:15:58 which is you would not take it even if...
00:16:00 Yeah, and then you've got bent, which is the middle,
00:16:02 and then you've got twisted, which is like the heart...
00:16:04 Twisted!
00:16:06 You're coming to work!
00:16:08 I mean, you can actually measure when you reach each of these phases.
00:16:12 If you're someone who just smokes a little weed every now and then, you're bent.
00:16:17 If you're someone who just drinks every now and then, you're bent.
00:16:19 If you're someone who does both, but not together,
00:16:23 you're like, you know, you're like getting there.
00:16:26 You're like, you're turnt, you're turnt, you're turnt at that point.
00:16:29 But if you do them both at once, you are twisted.
00:16:34 You're twisted, man!
00:16:36 That sounds good to me.
00:16:38 Are you straight-edge?
00:16:39 No, I am worthless.
00:16:42 Everyone, please, in the comments, let me know, are you straight-edge,
00:16:46 bent, turnt, or twisted?
00:16:48 Hashtag bent, turnt, etc.
00:16:53 Also post that on Twitter with those hashtags and make those memes.
00:16:58 Somebody make a graph of this and make that a meme.
00:17:02 I was just about to say, check the show.
00:17:04 And make sure you tag us in it, god damn it.
00:17:06 Tag it with PCP, put our logo on there.
00:17:08 We'll give you the PNG.
00:17:10 There will be a straw pool in the show notes right now.
00:17:13 Click which one you are.
00:17:14 You're straight-edge, you're turnt, you're twisted, or you're bent.
00:17:19 There's a straw pool.
00:17:20 Go vote there.
00:17:21 I'm going to guess right now, majority of the audience is straight-edge.
00:17:25 I'm going to go over 50%.
00:17:27 That's my guess.
00:17:28 I'm going to say 40%.
00:17:31 I think we have a lot of, straight-edge, we have a lot of ponsons.
00:17:34 I think we have a lot of ponsons who don't comment as much.
00:17:36 Because they're too busy being high.
00:17:37 That's possible.
00:17:38 Because they're too fucking high, dude.
00:17:39 I think it's going to be like 30% straight-edge, then like 30% bent.
00:17:44 And then like a little bit of them are twisted, and more of them are twisted.
00:17:50 I think that the sheer scope of the straight-edge selection of our fandom
00:17:56 will make Ben's gigantic body look minuscule by comparison.
00:18:01 That's what I think.
00:18:02 I don't know why I said that.
00:18:03 I am a massive human.
00:18:06 I am a Titan.
00:18:08 So, Ben, do you just like drink regularly?
00:18:11 Not even that.
00:18:13 Well, you know, I go through phases with stuff.
00:18:16 I will go like a long time without like drinking or smoking.
00:18:21 And then at some point maybe I'll pick one up.
00:18:23 I forgot you smoked.
00:18:24 I'll do it for a while.
00:18:25 Yeah, yeah, tobacco.
00:18:26 I don't think we don't like it.
00:18:27 Wait, wait, wait.
00:18:28 Where does vape fall?
00:18:29 Yeah, where does vape fall on the straight-edge, too?
00:18:30 Okay, yeah, people argue about that.
00:18:31 I think that the evidence is pretty good that vape is, if not like healthy.
00:18:36 At least not anything you really need to worry about health-wise.
00:18:39 People fucking try to debate me about that.
00:18:40 Cures cancer.
00:18:41 Cures cancer.
00:18:42 Yeah, exactly.
00:18:43 So, you know, I guess that, I guess, I don't know.
00:18:46 I don't know where that falls.
00:18:47 I mean, we don't do that much bad either.
00:18:51 So, I'll go for long periods without doing it.
00:18:54 I'll go for long periods without doing anything like that.
00:18:56 And like, I don't like doing it.
00:18:58 It doesn't feel good.
00:18:59 And like, I feel worse about myself when I do it.
00:19:03 Because it is.
00:19:04 It's just a big waste of time.
00:19:05 It's a big waste of money.
00:19:06 Waste of money.
00:19:07 Yeah, yeah.
00:19:08 I only do it when I'm sad and when I feel like life isn't worth living anyway.
00:19:13 Well, we'll see that.
00:19:14 Well, that's no good.
00:19:15 That's no good.
00:19:16 That's your body telling you to stop.
00:19:17 You need to listen to what your body is saying to you.
00:19:19 My body is saying, destroy thyself.
00:19:22 If somebody's doing drugs because they just want to have a great time, that's one thing.
00:19:26 If someone does drugs as a retreat from the real world, I mean, that, to me, seems like
00:19:31 that's the biggest thing to be avoided.
00:19:33 Well, drugs have never been that enjoyable.
00:19:36 I've done some drugs, like drug drugs, that have made me trip balls.
00:19:41 And I haven't really liked it or wanted to do much of it.
00:19:48 Picture Ben, picture Ben downing a Tylenol, stepping into a room full of little marbles,
00:19:52 and just be like, I'm tripping balls!
00:19:54 Whoa!
00:19:55 It falls into a ball pit hilariously.
00:19:57 Yeah, that was Ben.
00:19:59 I drank two rock stars in a row, and I had visions.
00:20:04 I shucked two Advils onto the hibachi grill, and I soaked those in as my whole.
00:20:10 I gotta say about that thing about whether or not weed is like healthy.
00:20:15 So I have smoked literally every day this year.
00:20:19 Like, there's not been a day that I have not been high for most of the day.
00:20:23 And I gotta tell you, it is definitely not good for your lungs or throat to smoke.
00:20:28 There you go.
00:20:29 Well, there is no shit, dude.
00:20:31 I would even say it's really bad for your lungs and throat to smoke.
00:20:36 I don't want to make this into a dark place, but Digi's voice has undergone something of a transformation in the last while,
00:20:43 which is another reason you should stop.
00:20:46 First of all, I think my voice sounds great.
00:20:49 I mean, I sound like shit right now because I literally took a world-ending bong rip at the start of the show.
00:20:55 But that's what I mean.
00:20:57 It's not as though it permanently damages your throat.
00:21:01 I mean, it can eventually erode your throat away.
00:21:04 If I were to smoke the way I am now for the next 20 years,
00:21:08 I will sound like fucking Johnny Cash on his deathbed or fucking...
00:21:12 Sure.
00:21:13 What's his name?
00:21:14 The...
00:21:15 Gotta be a chocolate Jesus.
00:21:17 You know what I'm talking about?
00:21:18 Uh, no.
00:21:19 Fuck it.
00:21:20 George Harrison.
00:21:21 Oh, no, Tom Waits.
00:21:23 That's the guy.
00:21:24 I'll sound like Tom Waits if I fucking do this for that long.
00:21:27 However, and I don't intend to, this is just because I'm like,
00:21:30 I just discovered it and it's fun and I can get away with it for like three or four years, you know?
00:21:34 Okay.
00:21:35 Until I have...
00:21:36 Three or four years, okay.
00:21:37 Well, once I have kids, I'm not gonna smoke weed all the fucking time.
00:21:40 But...
00:21:41 So...
00:21:43 It's...
00:21:44 Sorry.
00:21:45 My fucking mind just would completely blank.
00:21:48 Yeah, we're just talking about throat.
00:21:51 If it's hurt, if there are horrible health effects.
00:21:53 Yes, it fucking...
00:21:54 It definitely hurts like to...
00:21:56 When you take a gigantic rip, you're going to like...
00:21:59 I have coughed up, like, I've like vomited from my lungs.
00:22:02 Like, I've vomited flat.
00:22:03 Oh, boy.
00:22:04 And that shit is disgusting and it hurts.
00:22:07 Yeah.
00:22:08 And some...
00:22:09 And if you go out in the cold, while you have like, smoking your lungs,
00:22:12 it fucking hardens in your lungs and it feels like you're dying.
00:22:15 So don't do that.
00:22:17 When I was in Poland, I would smoke on my balcony.
00:22:20 And it was winter time.
00:22:21 I was there in Poland in the winter.
00:22:23 And as you can imagine, it was bitterly cold.
00:22:25 And from smoking on my porch in the bitter cold,
00:22:28 I developed a cough that lasted for months.
00:22:30 Like, even into the spring and summer, I was still coughing
00:22:33 from how much I had fucked up my insides doing that.
00:22:37 I think it was mostly the cold, actually.
00:22:39 But the smoking, surely, didn't help.
00:22:42 And that's my story.
00:22:43 Drugs are great.
00:22:44 Drugs are really nice because they give you a fleeting satisfaction.
00:22:47 That's really nice.
00:22:48 And it gives you cough for literal months afterwards.
00:22:50 That's a real...
00:22:51 Yeah.
00:22:52 Yeah, yeah.
00:22:53 Guys, I don't know if this...
00:22:54 You know, it's a trade-off, but it's worth it.
00:22:56 I'm sorry.
00:22:57 I was still on the search for C. Penis inside of vagina on YouTube.
00:23:02 And I found a video called...
00:23:04 I found it immediately.
00:23:05 Well, I actually didn't find it, but I found another one
00:23:07 called Two Brother Inside She-Elephant Vagina.
00:23:11 And there's a man inside She-Elephant Vagina.
00:23:15 I didn't see that T-Bap episode.
00:23:17 I didn't see...
00:23:18 Yeah, that was the...
00:23:19 You know what?
00:23:20 I'll just link it to you.
00:23:21 I don't know, like, will we get in trouble if we put this in the show notes?
00:23:24 Because it's on YouTube.
00:23:25 It is a man inside an elephant vagina getting fucked
00:23:29 and the elephant comes all over him inside the elephant vagina.
00:23:33 Wait, the guy is getting fucked?
00:23:34 This is from, like, a movie.
00:23:35 Yeah.
00:23:36 Wait, the guy is...
00:23:37 I don't understand.
00:23:38 Is he...
00:23:39 You know what?
00:23:40 This is fucking madness.
00:23:41 How does he breathe?
00:23:42 I'm not clicking on it.
00:23:43 Well, it's a pretty big hole.
00:23:44 No, no, no.
00:23:45 The guy is that...
00:23:46 It's...
00:23:47 I'm not clicking on it.
00:23:48 There's a man inside of an elephant's vagina
00:23:50 and the elephant is getting fucked by another elephant.
00:23:52 So there's a gigantic dick, like, passing over his head
00:23:55 and coming all over him.
00:23:56 That's right.
00:23:57 How does he not...
00:23:58 Just watch the clip.
00:23:59 It's right there.
00:24:00 I don't want to watch the fucking clip.
00:24:02 Look, there's a lot of room.
00:24:03 There's a lot of room in there.
00:24:04 It's not, like, real.
00:24:05 It's like a goofy comedy movie, like, retarded, fucking...
00:24:08 It looks fake as shit.
00:24:09 Wait, is it Freddy Got Fingered?
00:24:10 It looks like...
00:24:11 It's similar to Freddy Got Fingered.
00:24:13 I don't know.
00:24:14 I haven't seen that movie, so maybe...
00:24:15 Oh, I just saw the computer.
00:24:17 Yeah, it's pretty...
00:24:18 Okay, you know what?
00:24:19 This has nothing to do with drugs.
00:24:20 Oh, hey, how about porn?
00:24:21 Porn's a drug on your brain, right?
00:24:23 It kind of is.
00:24:24 Probably, yeah.
00:24:25 Okay, here.
00:24:26 Let's change the order here.
00:24:28 Let's get back on fucking track.
00:24:30 I want to say my opening statement.
00:24:32 Weed use...
00:24:33 And again, this is going to be, like, the weed cast.
00:24:35 Weed use is not inherently a problem.
00:24:37 It's weed overuse is the problem.
00:24:39 I don't care if you're...
00:24:41 I don't know if you're...
00:24:42 What's the term?
00:24:43 Bent.
00:24:44 I don't care if you're bent.
00:24:45 I just want to smoke a bowl sometimes.
00:24:46 I don't want to be around you while you're high, but, like, you know, whatever.
00:24:50 I don't care.
00:24:51 But when you are twisted, when you reach digilevels, that's the point when shit starts to go south
00:24:57 and I start not wanting to be around you or associate you.
00:25:00 Oh, shit.
00:25:01 Oh, no.
00:25:02 This is the intervention.
00:25:03 I mean, I know what you mean.
00:25:04 I know what you mean.
00:25:05 I had a friend, Nick, when I was young, who...
00:25:09 We would, like, do weed occasionally, and he would just be around and watch everybody,
00:25:13 like, get high, and he just enjoyed observing and being, like, the one non-high guy.
00:25:18 So there's an element of that that's kind of fun.
00:25:20 It's, like, when Tails gets trolled, when Tails and Cheeto Man are, you know, they're
00:25:25 trying to get high and Doug Funny wants to hang out and smoke weed with them, and everyone's
00:25:29 like, oh, we don't want to hang out with Doug, but Cheeto Man's like, nah, Doug's cool, Doug's
00:25:33 cool, but then Doug gets too high and gets really weird about the time that Skeeter gave
00:25:38 him a handjob, and then he bites Spyro's dog, and then he throws up from weed, and Tails
00:25:46 makes fun of him for being a lightweight.
00:25:48 I don't know what the relevance of this story.
00:25:50 I just wanted to talk about that for a while.
00:25:52 What's that flaky lecture coming out?
00:25:54 Probably in, like, a week.
00:25:55 Okay, cool.
00:25:56 Maybe even by the time this is out.
00:25:58 Tails gets trolled like that.
00:25:59 You know, Munchy Electro out now, everybody.
00:26:00 Munchy Electro's out on his channel, so go watch that shit.
00:26:03 Hey, you have to send that to Dick, did you?
00:26:05 Oh, I did already.
00:26:07 Oh, there you go.
00:26:08 There you go.
00:26:09 Okay, what were we talking about, Munchy?
00:26:12 We're talking about how I don't think weed uses a problem, but I think that weed overuses
00:26:16 a problem.
00:26:17 It's a matter of scales.
00:26:18 A different amount comes a different in kind.
00:26:21 Well, you know, here's the real shit here is, like, what does someone want to do with
00:26:26 their time?
00:26:27 Like, I don't think it's fair to criticize people, even if someone who gets blasted out
00:26:32 of their mind every single day and just doesn't do anything productive.
00:26:35 I mean, this is just how I feel about life in general.
00:26:39 I'm totally, like, egalitarian here, or libertarian here.
00:26:43 As long as you're handling your shit, what business is it of mine?
00:26:47 Like, what you do with your free time?
00:26:49 It's got nothing to do with me.
00:26:50 I would imagine that would not be your position, because I thought you want people to be productive
00:26:53 and just do their work.
00:26:55 I do want people to be productive.
00:26:57 There's two things happening here.
00:26:58 On the one hand, people can do whatever they want with their life, and I would like them
00:27:03 to be productive, but on the other hand, if you come to me, having not been productive
00:27:07 and say, listen, I didn't get my life together, please help me, I will look down and I will
00:27:12 say no.
00:27:13 I will say die.
00:27:14 I will say no.
00:27:15 I mean, I gotta tell you that, like, weed has made me way more productive than before,
00:27:21 so, like...
00:27:22 Well, that's what I'm saying, you know?
00:27:23 If a person can do weed and be more productive, fantastic.
00:27:26 If they do weed and they're not productive, I mean, that's their business to work out.
00:27:30 The great thing about being high all day is that you pretty much can't really go anywhere
00:27:36 or do anything, so all you really can do is work.
00:27:39 It's like, I'm just here at my desk with what's in front of me.
00:27:44 I know I want to do at least eight hours of work today, so let's just get extremely blasted
00:27:49 and zoned in, put on some good music, and fucking just work all day, you know?
00:27:55 So, that's been just like every single day for as long as I can remember at this point.
00:28:02 Great.
00:28:03 Which is like three minutes, basically.
00:28:05 Well, so, we can't judge what your life is like.
00:28:07 Because I have three cells left.
00:28:09 Sure, but you're basically a public artist, so, like, you know, that works for you.
00:28:14 You can do those sorts of things, and we obviously don't have insight into, like, your day-to-day
00:28:18 life, but we can see what's been produced, and so that's the one window that we have
00:28:23 to, like, critique, such as it is, you know, this change in lifestyle.
00:28:28 There are two pillars that hold up my entire being, and this goes back to the very episode.
00:28:33 There are two, like, tenets of my entire personality that are completely contradictory to one another,
00:28:39 and I have to battle them on a daily basis.
00:28:41 The first pillar is you can do whatever you want, and the second pillar is don't be retarded.
00:28:48 And those are clashing constantly.
00:28:51 I agree, sure. People can do what they want in their free time, you know, sure.
00:28:56 It's if it's recreational, you know, whatever.
00:28:58 But I don't want to be around people who are retarded, and I think it negatively impacts them
00:29:03 on a social, economical, and just, like, physical well-being.
00:29:07 I think it affects them on multiple levels.
00:29:10 So, like, sure, I'm not gonna fucking call the police, but I think that you probably should
00:29:15 probably think twice, and this is my opinion, so I'm gonna fucking say it.
00:29:19 You know, I hear you on that, Munchy. It reminds me a little bit of something, though.
00:29:22 I think you're being a little bit, I mean, it's totally understandable,
00:29:26 and, like, you're probably right about most people doing these sorts of things.
00:29:30 But then, I think to myself, you know, not everybody fits the exact mold,
00:29:34 and really, like, what they should do is necessarily in line with, like,
00:29:39 what the most average person in society should do,
00:29:42 aka, like, you know, not go crazy doing drugs.
00:29:44 Well, like, I'm thinking of, for example, I was on Twitter yesterday,
00:29:47 and I tweeted out, like, a video from Whiplash,
00:29:51 where the kid, the main kid, like, breaks up with his girlfriend,
00:29:55 because he's like, listen, all I care about in life is drumming.
00:29:58 That's all I want to do. Therefore, I don't have time for a relationship,
00:30:01 so I'm ending it here. And, like, the girl, I mean, and just everyone's response,
00:30:04 I tweeted out about how inspirational I found that,
00:30:06 and, you know, I didn't really articulate, because it's Twitter,
00:30:08 exactly in what ways I like that.
00:30:10 I just admire his, like, commitment to his goals.
00:30:13 But then, like, everyone starts being like, um, actually, he, like, is really shit,
00:30:17 and he shouldn't have done that, because it's, like, bad, and you need to live a balanced life,
00:30:20 and, like, sure, if you, if you, like, are a normal fag, then, yeah,
00:30:25 you'll probably be happiest in life doing that sort of thing.
00:30:28 This is why I fucking hated The Princess and the Frog,
00:30:30 because in the end, the message was, like, if you don't have love,
00:30:33 you can't just be a strong, powerful woman.
00:30:35 I straight up, that is my favorite Disney movie, because I just ignore the ending,
00:30:39 and I just don't, I do not learn, I just watch the beginning,
00:30:43 and I'm like, this is the perfect woman, I love Tiana so much, et cetera, et cetera.
00:30:47 Uh, so, like, people, people are really eager.
00:30:50 My point is that people are really eager to, like, want to say that, you know,
00:30:55 people should live their life, that's exactly it.
00:30:57 But there are lots of individuals, like, in Digi's lifestyle,
00:31:01 it seems to me that doing lots of weeds is not going to inherently be necessarily a problem
00:31:08 to a degree, to a degree.
00:31:10 Because there are things like, well, yeah, go on, Munchy.
00:31:13 Two things to that. First of all, this is anything different than the Furious episode.
00:31:16 This is, like, a blanket statement to appeal to the general audience here.
00:31:21 There will be outliers, there are people who do not, you know,
00:31:24 even though they are twisted, they live perfectly, like, serviceable lives,
00:31:28 there are tons of musicians and things who smoke weed, and, you know,
00:31:31 the fucking Beatles smoke the Bola Day, and, you know, they're the Beatles, so it's fine.
00:31:36 I was about to go into a point about that, because, like, as much as I absolutely...
00:31:40 Whoa, fucking hold on, bitch, I was in the middle of a two-point thing.
00:31:44 Okay, okay, Gib will go after, just hang on, put a pin in that.
00:31:48 Yeah, yeah, so there's, like, you know, you can...
00:31:52 They couldn't smoke on a Bola Day.
00:31:54 It's a matter of scale, it's a matter of overuse,
00:31:57 and it's a matter of, like, not just, you know, doing it because you want to,
00:32:01 it's a matter of overuse and me being around you.
00:32:04 So, like...
00:32:05 Well, okay, are you being selfish there, though?
00:32:08 You're saying what you want them to do for your benefit.
00:32:11 What has this entire podcast lead up to this point B?
00:32:14 It's us shouting our opinion at the audience, and pretending that it's not correct,
00:32:19 and what should have happened.
00:32:21 That's what this entire podcast has been for, like, what, like, 100 episodes now?
00:32:25 Why now is this a problem? Why now is me saying what I think the world should be?
00:32:29 Now, like, suddenly, like, twisted and, you know, devilish.
00:32:32 Because your reasoning is that you want to impose your standards on other people,
00:32:37 and, you know...
00:32:38 Nate, that's what you do every day, and that's not a problem.
00:32:40 That's just how you believe.
00:32:41 Well, I don't know. I feel like I'm pretty careful to make sure that people understand.
00:32:46 Nate, you are right now imposing the belief of, like...
00:32:50 That people should do what they want, that's right.
00:32:52 Yeah, exactly. As opposed to, like, the, you know,
00:32:55 if Munchie holds totalitarian beliefs that we all need to be, like, under God,
00:32:59 and that, like, he was imposing the belief that Munchie should win.
00:33:02 Stop trying to fucking now.
00:33:03 I'm not saying I want to ban every, every, like, ounce of weed on the place.
00:33:07 No, no, no. I was just, I wasn't saying you actually thought that I was being rhetorical.
00:33:12 Of course.
00:33:13 Well, okay, Gib was chiming in with something.
00:33:16 What about the beans? Tell us.
00:33:18 Well, it was, it was...
00:33:20 The thing that I have is that, as much as I absolutely hate to admit it,
00:33:26 weed and drugs and mind-altering substances,
00:33:30 despite how much I hate this idea,
00:33:33 do actually result in artists being really creative and cool.
00:33:38 They have and will and do result in really cool stuff.
00:33:43 But the problem I find with, like, things
00:33:46 is that people aren't doing the hard stuff anymore.
00:33:49 I think people should be stopping weed because it's baby shit.
00:33:52 It's too, it's too weak. It's got, it's got two, three of the letters in week are in the year.
00:33:58 Three of them?
00:33:59 Wait, only two.
00:34:00 No, three.
00:34:01 That's most of them.
00:34:02 Wait, like, like, weak as in, like, seven days?
00:34:04 I mean, that's accurate.
00:34:05 Yes.
00:34:06 And, and fucking, they should be doing,
00:34:08 they should be doing the hard stuff.
00:34:09 They should be doing LSD.
00:34:10 They should be doing acid.
00:34:11 PCP.
00:34:12 Fucking PCP, Red Bull, like, all that really dangerous about the world to you.
00:34:17 I find...
00:34:18 So that we can make, like, new, new Beatles stuff, new Pink Floyds.
00:34:22 Well, again, again.
00:34:23 Like, I want people to be incredible.
00:34:25 But the thing is, weed is, like, quantity over quality.
00:34:29 People smoke all the time and it's the amount of time that they're out of commission.
00:34:33 They're not really more creative.
00:34:35 They're just sort of, like, ugh.
00:34:37 But they're not, like, they're not, like, putting themselves at risk.
00:34:40 They're like, if they put themselves at risk,
00:34:42 they would die more and they would be doing less all the parts of the day.
00:34:46 I'll tell you, because as you experienced firsthand,
00:34:50 because you tried to smoke with me and you kind of didn't have that much
00:34:54 and it didn't end up getting you high at all, right?
00:34:56 Yeah.
00:34:57 And it very much is just like drinking.
00:35:00 It's like, how much you put in is how much you get out.
00:35:02 You can have a couple beers and get a light buzz and just, you know, carry about your day.
00:35:08 You can have three or four beers and be like,
00:35:10 hey, I'm having a party or you can get obliterated
00:35:12 and, like, you're gonna be the life of the party,
00:35:14 but you might not remember it tomorrow, so it's a risk, you know?
00:35:17 And with weed, if you get that high,
00:35:21 like, you get so high that you're gonna, like, see shit
00:35:24 and, like, really fucking deeply experience the media you watch and all that shit,
00:35:29 like, you have to be willing to risk the fact that you're gonna be on a bad fucking, like,
00:35:34 you're gonna think about a lot of shit you didn't want to think about
00:35:37 about your past and all the worst things that have happened in your life
00:35:40 and, like, how you're a piece of shit
00:35:42 and you can't escape that mind prison and you'll be there for hours.
00:35:45 Like, if you cross that threshold into being what I call mega-big-high,
00:35:50 if you are mega-big-high, you're going to just cross over into this other world
00:35:54 of which there's no escape and that's why most people I think, like me,
00:35:58 who the first time I smoked, I got that high and it was, like, fucking nightmare,
00:36:02 people who tend to end up that high when they smoke are just like,
00:36:06 I don't want to do it regularly, because...
00:36:08 That's how I felt when I did it.
00:36:09 Right, exactly.
00:36:10 I feel like people, like, I like munchy.
00:36:13 I don't like people who smoke.
00:36:15 I don't like the smell.
00:36:16 The smell is like, I mean, I have a story about why I hate the smell,
00:36:19 which I can get into later, but, like, the...
00:36:22 I don't like hanging around people who are, like, intoxicated or in some way
00:36:28 slightly beyond normal.
00:36:30 Well, I don't like that person.
00:36:31 So I would prefer people to just not drink and smoke, like, every day,
00:36:37 but to do it, like, once a month, but get so drunk or so high
00:36:41 that they do something incredible.
00:36:43 I would prefer it to be, like, an explosive thing,
00:36:46 rather than just, like, a small burn throughout the entire of their life.
00:36:51 Like, if you're, like, out dealing with people who are, like, drunk or high
00:36:54 and, like, you don't know them, like, I personally am pretty wary of, like, just...
00:36:59 You know, because they're unpredictable and it's like, well, I don't know.
00:37:03 I do not want to interact with any, like, higher drunk strangers.
00:37:06 I don't understand, like, the idea of going to a place where, like,
00:37:11 you know everyone's drunk and you don't know who any of them are,
00:37:14 but, like, everyone there is volatile and, like...
00:37:17 Yeah.
00:37:18 Like, if I'm going to be...
00:37:19 It's like the club.
00:37:20 If I'm going to be super drunk or high, I'd prefer to be those around people I know
00:37:24 and trust because I'm in a more vulnerable state, you know?
00:37:27 Yeah, totally.
00:37:29 But Gib, Gib, let me just...
00:37:31 I just want to clarify with Gib on one thing, because I just want to...
00:37:33 I liked his point and I want to expand on it because I think I agree with it.
00:37:36 It's like, so, Gib, you were saying before about, like, you think people are just, like,
00:37:39 they're doing it too much and they're, I don't know, maybe you mean, like, using it as a crutch.
00:37:42 It's quite a quality of a quality.
00:37:45 Like, the amount of hours you spend doing that thing when you could be, like,
00:37:49 you know, chugging a big old whiskey bottle and going insane just one time a month instead.
00:37:54 Oh, well, okay, I see what you mean by that.
00:37:56 And that's basically more efficient.
00:37:58 What I see, actually, there's a lot of people I respect in the world,
00:38:01 like musicians and whatnot, who do a lot of drugs, and that's all fine.
00:38:05 You know, the Beatles did it in their most famous band ever.
00:38:07 Like, to me, the way I think of it is, there are, like, people alive right now.
00:38:12 Like, guys like Sam Harris, for example, who, he's a neuroscientist,
00:38:16 and he has done a bunch of drugs, because he's, like, an atheist.
00:38:20 He doesn't believe in free will.
00:38:22 You know, I find him a pretty inspiring guy.
00:38:24 And he has done really hard drugs.
00:38:27 But the point is, like, he's such a serious guy.
00:38:30 And he has, like, put in the work to put himself in a place.
00:38:34 Like, he's gone, like, as far as he could go, like, practicing, like, meditation and yoga
00:38:40 as a way to, like, understand human consciousness, which he's really interested in.
00:38:43 But then, like, you get really far with that path.
00:38:46 And then you start to, like, your gains start to level off from your understanding.
00:38:49 And once you've, like, become self-disciplined and you've done this research,
00:38:53 it's at that point where I think using drugs to then push yourself harder
00:38:57 than, like, a human being could go, now that you've put yourself in a position
00:39:01 where you can actually capitalize on this.
00:39:03 Like, then doing drugs makes sense, because then you'll really be able to appreciate it.
00:39:07 Whereas opposed to, like, if you've got, like, an 18-year-old college dropout,
00:39:12 or 20-year-old college dropout, just sitting at home is like,
00:39:14 yeah, I'm gonna do weed, and I'm gonna be, like, the greatest musician of all time.
00:39:17 Like, never practices, like, never do anything.
00:39:19 That's definitely a part of the aspect of, like, the things.
00:39:22 Like, if you're the sort of person who, obviously, is dangerous,
00:39:25 but, like, it does have, like, more impressive results than just doing a weed every so often.
00:39:30 I want to, I want to see it.
00:39:31 To do an LSD.
00:39:32 I want us to get away from the, like, the, both the artist and the burnout side of it for a bit,
00:39:37 because those are kind of, I think, like, stereotypes about, like, people who smoke weed.
00:39:41 But I think the vast majority of people who smoke weed are just normies
00:39:46 who smoke it to literally, like, because they work a normal ass job
00:39:50 and they don't do anything afterwards, you know?
00:39:52 Wait, hippo, I just want to say that I don't even disagree with you.
00:39:56 And I have that right down here on my notes.
00:39:58 That, like, again, it's, like, if you're an artist and you want to take a weed or LSD,
00:40:03 you know, like, you know, twice a month or whatever, I don't, you know,
00:40:06 I don't have hard numbers or anything.
00:40:08 But, you know, if you want to take it every once in a while, casually, I have no problem with that.
00:40:11 It's just when it becomes a part of your identity,
00:40:13 becomes a part of yourself, becomes something that you do every day,
00:40:15 part of your routine.
00:40:16 If you can't eat without weed, you cannot fuel your body.
00:40:19 If you cannot intake sustenance without weed, that's when it comes up.
00:40:23 Yeah, you got a problem. You got a problem there.
00:40:25 Uh, yeah, yeah.
00:40:28 That's why I was saying to close out that so you can go on whatever the hell you want.
00:40:31 Yeah, anyway, I think most people who smoke are just, like,
00:40:34 and this is the reason that 420 is, like, such a symbolic number.
00:40:39 Like, what it really means at the core is because it's right after you get home from work.
00:40:45 Like, that's the idea.
00:40:46 You get home at four o'clock, you roll up a joint for the next 20 minutes,
00:40:51 and then you smoke at 420.
00:40:52 It's a way that normal people who live without much to do, like, to entertain themselves,
00:40:58 like, especially poor people, like, is the, you know, the most people who smoke weed,
00:41:03 because you can just relax and, you know, just sit around and do whatever,
00:41:08 watch the regular ass TV or whatever the fuck you do.
00:41:11 Um, same reason other people do this with a six-pack, you know,
00:41:14 guys who come home by a six-pack of beer and they drink a six-pack every single fucking night
00:41:18 because they just work at the shipyard and they come home and watch TV all night,
00:41:22 you know, and then they get fat and have kids and they continue doing this until they die.
00:41:26 I have a suggestion for these people, though.
00:41:27 They should, instead of doing that and spending all that money on weed and whatnot,
00:41:30 they should come home, like, have an internet subscription,
00:41:33 just, like, do, play some relaxing music, whatever you want to do,
00:41:36 and take that money that you would have spent on weed and put it in the bank,
00:41:40 put in a 401k, save that shit for retirement, my dude.
00:41:44 You'll feel so much better.
00:41:45 I mean, these people might not have a...
00:41:47 It's kind of a big ask to have a reliable internet connection.
00:41:50 To have a bank account? Is that really much...
00:41:52 Wait, the internet connection is not...
00:41:53 The internet connection was the part I was talking about.
00:41:55 Well, I mean, we're talking about people in first world countries here.
00:41:58 I think that's not...
00:41:59 Yeah, we are.
00:42:00 I mean, we're talking about...
00:42:02 I feel like a lot of people would, when they retire,
00:42:05 would just want to sit around smoking weed anyway.
00:42:09 I can't go into this conversation without just bringing in my baggage
00:42:14 of how much happier I think everyone is when they're using their time
00:42:18 as productively as possible.
00:42:19 I just think that makes people happier.
00:42:21 I mean, I don't begrudge people having something to wind down
00:42:25 after a long day of work.
00:42:26 Of course not.
00:42:27 I just don't think that...
00:42:28 I don't think most people have the capacity to do what you're suggesting, Nate.
00:42:32 Like, I don't think a lot of people literally...
00:42:34 To save money?
00:42:35 I think that most people do not have...
00:42:38 Well, yeah, definitely not to save money.
00:42:40 Most people do not have the cognitive capacity to save money,
00:42:43 nor to have a second life outside of work.
00:42:46 Like, most people come home and they're just fucking exhausted and done,
00:42:51 and they just want to kick up and not think about anything
00:42:54 because they do not have those kinds of complicated thoughts
00:42:57 that lead people down other paths.
00:42:59 So boring.
00:43:00 So boring.
00:43:01 It's unfortunate, but like, these people...
00:43:03 These are the people who need this shit the most
00:43:06 because all we need them for is to be the worker ants
00:43:08 running our colony of the fucking world.
00:43:10 Like, all these...
00:43:11 I mean, the worth of normies in society
00:43:14 is that someone's got to run all this shit.
00:43:17 We don't...
00:43:18 Us intellectuals who just want to go to a Walmart
00:43:20 and like fucking...
00:43:21 If you...
00:43:22 If you...
00:43:23 Yo, catch me an intellectual at Walmart.
00:43:25 If you have the IQ that you can watch Rick and Morty
00:43:28 and you just want to like hop down to the Walmart
00:43:31 and grab a fucking, you know, a quick case of whatever
00:43:34 soda fucking caffeinated thing you need to get through your day,
00:43:38 someone has to be there to sell that shit to you.
00:43:40 And that person, like, needs to be there every single day
00:43:43 doing this demeaning job that has to exist,
00:43:46 but like, so, you know, these people...
00:43:48 We need these people and we got to keep them satiated.
00:43:51 We got to make sure that they're not fucking pissed
00:43:53 because if they're pissed, they rise up.
00:43:54 Well, you know, Digi?
00:43:55 You know, Digi?
00:43:56 That's all the reason.
00:43:57 That's the only way to fulfill your life.
00:43:58 It's not the only way to get dopamine.
00:44:00 This is why...
00:44:01 Yeah, but it's a good way.
00:44:02 It's a cheap way.
00:44:03 The most important thing is that we need to get post-scarcity
00:44:05 so that people, even these people,
00:44:07 can choose to not waste their lives
00:44:09 as shitty jobs like this.
00:44:10 I figured out how to like replace weed
00:44:14 as like a way to give people the dopamine rush that they need.
00:44:17 Fucking make playplaces for adults.
00:44:19 Finally, please.
00:44:21 I just want to go in one of those...
00:44:23 I want to be like, you are old enough to be in here.
00:44:27 In fact, you're too old,
00:44:29 and that's why you're allowed in here, yes.
00:44:32 Incidentally, something that I want everyone to understand,
00:44:36 and this is part of why I started smoking so much weed,
00:44:40 is that when I went to Portland
00:44:42 and I saw what it was like there,
00:44:44 I realized that when weed is legal everywhere,
00:44:47 fucking everyone will be high most of the time
00:44:51 because it's super cheap
00:44:53 and it just puts you in a better mood
00:44:56 and it gets you through the day
00:44:58 and no reason people won't do it
00:45:00 because if you have a...
00:45:02 especially in a city like that where there's good public transit,
00:45:04 you don't have to drive anywhere
00:45:06 so there's no reason you wouldn't just go around high all the time.
00:45:09 So that's what it's going to be like
00:45:11 and the reason is that the amount that I smoke in a day,
00:45:15 and I smoke a hell of a lot of weed,
00:45:17 but I smoke an amount that's equivalent to buying a Big Mac once a day.
00:45:21 It's not...
00:45:22 But only if you're somewhere where it's legal.
00:45:24 That's not true where I live.
00:45:26 I pay way the fuck more for weed
00:45:29 because it's not fully...
00:45:31 it's not sold in dispensaries here.
00:45:33 But in places where it's legal, it's so cheap
00:45:36 that everyone's going to be doing it all the time
00:45:38 and when I realize that that's where the tide's turning,
00:45:41 that's going to be...
00:45:43 that already is normal in some places
00:45:45 and will be normal everywhere in America soon,
00:45:47 there's no reason to even think of it as differently than that.
00:45:52 Richie, why are you concerned with being normal?
00:45:55 Why are you concerned with being a little bit normal?
00:45:57 Well, I'm concerned with it because of the fact
00:45:59 that I am terrified of doing anything illegal
00:46:02 and I have never been someone who does illegal illicit activities,
00:46:07 except for in the most safe conditions imaginable.
00:46:10 I think you're being really selfish here.
00:46:12 Think of all those hard-working cartel members in Mexico right now
00:46:15 and we're going to put them out of a fucking job
00:46:17 if we legalize weed.
00:46:18 We can't do that.
00:46:19 How can we do that to them?
00:46:21 Fuck them.
00:46:22 Fuck them.
00:46:23 We'll replace them with robot cartels.
00:46:25 We have to keep the cartels.
00:46:28 We keep the cartels, we automate their job.
00:46:31 Yeah, and then we just tell them...
00:46:33 Yeah, robots aren't allowed to kill people.
00:46:35 Replace the poor with poor robots.
00:46:37 To the people who come home tired after work,
00:46:41 I don't...
00:46:43 I sympathize.
00:46:45 I sympathize with them.
00:46:46 I understand why they would want it to happen.
00:46:48 But what I would suggest is that you should go outside
00:46:52 or get a hobby, because I know what it's like.
00:46:55 What if you live somewhere where you go outside and you get shot?
00:46:58 The internet, man. The internet.
00:47:00 Maybe it's idealistic and maybe it's...
00:47:03 I don't know.
00:47:04 Maybe I'm coming from a place of...
00:47:05 I hate the Procrasteers podcast.
00:47:07 I fucking hate it.
00:47:09 I can't get through a single point without literally every single host
00:47:14 constantly cutting me off for no reason.
00:47:16 I'll be in the middle of a fucking sentence.
00:47:18 And everyone, like vultures, trying to jump on me
00:47:22 and cannibalize my point.
00:47:24 The point where it's unrecognizable.
00:47:26 I don't get a single word in edgewise.
00:47:28 The point that I'm trying to make is why I don't...
00:47:32 I won't be able to go outside, because I know what it's like to be inside all the time.
00:47:35 I know what it's like to be inside and be just...
00:47:38 And not do anything.
00:47:40 I know what that feels like.
00:47:42 For myself, I think that's what's best is to go outside and get a hobby
00:47:45 and do what you love and do art or something.
00:47:47 I know it's a blanket statement that's what should be done for everyone.
00:47:51 Sure, there are outliers, but I shouldn't even say that.
00:47:53 I shouldn't even start up with my movie review.
00:47:55 This is just my opinion, guys.
00:47:57 Everyone's top ten list will be the same.
00:47:59 That's a given in this climate.
00:48:01 This is a conversation about weed.
00:48:03 We're talking...
00:48:04 We're having a conversation about what we're trying to find these lines.
00:48:07 This is literally the purpose of this conversation,
00:48:10 where is the line, when is it okay,
00:48:12 what is the parameters of how people should use it.
00:48:16 The reason I'm bringing up these talking points
00:48:18 is that I'm literally just talking about shit that literally every rapper raps about.
00:48:22 The reason weed is talked about so much in rap music
00:48:25 is it's almost always presented as,
00:48:27 this is the way that our people get through life,
00:48:30 is that we have nothing and this is what can make us happy.
00:48:35 They probably have a little bit more,
00:48:37 if they save a bit of all that money that they spend buying weed,
00:48:40 to advance their careers,
00:48:42 or try and move out of their terrible neighborhood,
00:48:44 or invest in whatever...
00:48:46 That's what Jay-Z says.
00:48:47 How much money do you think you're going to save
00:48:49 by putting away a little bit of weed?
00:48:50 Jay-Z encourages smoking weed,
00:48:52 but he does encourage not buying dumb bullshit like expensive cars
00:48:56 and frivolous spending.
00:48:58 Alright, here's the difference between getting some weed
00:49:02 and then getting some nice soda that you like.
00:49:04 There's no difference.
00:49:06 It's the same...
00:49:07 That's why I compared it to a Big Mac.
00:49:09 People buy these things because it's a step up from,
00:49:14 like, gruel, it's a step up from,
00:49:16 I have to eat Pop Tarts and Ramen,
00:49:18 but it's...
00:49:20 For me, growing up,
00:49:22 getting to eat fast food was something special, right?
00:49:25 We wanted...
00:49:26 That was better than at home dinner,
00:49:28 at least in my household.
00:49:29 My parents can't cook for shit.
00:49:31 And we were poor for a lot of times,
00:49:34 so we just ate crackers, nothing.
00:49:37 So going to a...
00:49:41 And we were a bunch of skinny, picky kids.
00:49:43 Even if we had options, we wouldn't have eaten any of it.
00:49:45 We would just go to McDonald's and be like,
00:49:47 wow, this is a step up, this is a real meal that I'm enjoying.
00:49:51 And now as an adult, I see that it's like disgusting filth
00:49:53 that I wouldn't touch because I know A, how to cook,
00:49:56 and B, I can go to a better restaurant.
00:49:58 But when you're in a situation where you don't...
00:50:00 I'm so hungry.
00:50:01 You know, I'm getting...
00:50:03 I'm actually making myself really hungry, too.
00:50:05 I lost my point in train of thought.
00:50:07 Well, you know, that was a very interesting point there.
00:50:10 The difference between weed and soda
00:50:13 is that you don't get high from soda,
00:50:16 and that you don't get, like,
00:50:18 a dopamine rush in your mind from soda.
00:50:21 That's actually not...
00:50:23 I mean, I feel that way when I haven't had soda
00:50:25 for like a month, and then I drink my first one.
00:50:27 That's how I feel when I drink a soda.
00:50:30 When you're not desensitized...
00:50:32 You get fucking high from drinking a Dr. Pepper?
00:50:35 When I'm really desensitized,
00:50:37 I'm somebody who reacts really strongly
00:50:39 to any kind of stimulus.
00:50:41 I drink a sip of an energy drink,
00:50:43 and I feel like my whole vision changes.
00:50:45 That's the level, because I don't drink it that much.
00:50:48 But when you get yourself desensitized to something,
00:50:51 it loses that effect.
00:50:53 When I drink it, there's been times
00:50:55 where I'm drinking Mountain Dew every single day,
00:50:57 and I need it just to get through the day,
00:50:59 and when I stop having it, I feel miserable,
00:51:01 and then I fucking scrounge together
00:51:03 whatever money I could find.
00:51:05 This is something I actually did when my parents
00:51:07 cut me off from Mountain Dew one time.
00:51:09 I was just fucking scrounging together dollars
00:51:11 to ride my bike to 7-Eleven
00:51:13 to secretly, covertly buy it,
00:51:15 because I was so addicted to it.
00:51:17 But when I stopped drinking it,
00:51:19 the next time I had it over a year later,
00:51:21 it was like, oh my God,
00:51:23 the sugar in this is so overwhelming.
00:51:25 You gotta drink that diet, dude, dude.
00:51:27 It's all about the diet, dude.
00:51:29 I'm fucking feast of the diet.
00:51:31 I will proselytize the diet soda is the greatest.
00:51:33 It's a fucking miracle.
00:51:35 I just went through this myself.
00:51:37 I never drink soda.
00:51:39 I barely eat sugary stuff,
00:51:41 but just fucking...
00:51:43 I bought a high-ball, organic,
00:51:45 grapefruit juice energy drink,
00:51:47 and I drank, it's got 40 grams of sugar in it.
00:51:49 40 fucking grams.
00:51:51 So, for me, like, a dessert,
00:51:53 a glass of orange juice is so rich.
00:51:55 It's so rich.
00:51:57 It is my cake,
00:51:59 a fucking glass of orange juice.
00:52:01 And this high-ball energy drink is the same.
00:52:03 I think the thing Munchie was getting at, though,
00:52:05 is like, weed gets you high
00:52:07 in, like, a very specific way
00:52:09 that, like, you can be,
00:52:11 like, completely incapacitated
00:52:13 if you're the sort of person
00:52:15 who, like, reacts that way to it.
00:52:17 Ben, what are you laughing about?
00:52:19 I just envisioned a world where, like,
00:52:21 Nate's eating his beans, right?
00:52:23 But it's, like, his day of the month
00:52:25 that he's gonna treat himself.
00:52:27 So he sneaks a jelly bean
00:52:29 in there among the regular beans.
00:52:31 Oh, no.
00:52:33 And then, you know, he's...
00:52:35 But he doesn't know where it is.
00:52:37 And it comes to surprise,
00:52:39 and when he hits that secret jelly bean,
00:52:41 it's the ultimate coom.
00:52:43 Dude, that...
00:52:45 It's like when you finally bite into that cyanide capsule
00:52:47 you've hidden in your teeth, and I just die.
00:52:49 That's what it's like.
00:52:51 That's a funny issue.
00:52:53 He's just got a bunch of frijoles negros
00:52:55 and he just throws one sweet, delicious
00:52:57 licorice jelly bean in there.
00:52:59 Everybody's favorite.
00:53:01 Yo.
00:53:03 Okay, but here's the real question.
00:53:05 Was he saying something?
00:53:07 The thing I was saying is that I feel like
00:53:09 if weed became, like,
00:53:11 one of the many things
00:53:13 you could just go into the convenience store
00:53:15 and buy, like, you get a chocolate bar,
00:53:17 a chocolate candy bar,
00:53:19 something, a thing, a soda,
00:53:21 and a weed, you know, it's all there.
00:53:23 That's, like, literally what it's like
00:53:25 in the places where it's legal.
00:53:27 Like, the dispensaries you walk in,
00:53:29 it's like a bunch of cheery-eyed people come up
00:53:31 and, like, everything's presented very nicely.
00:53:33 It's like an applesauce point.
00:53:35 Huh?
00:53:37 Go on. That was the middle of your point.
00:53:39 But that's how it goes, baby.
00:53:41 I was just, you know, telling him about dispensaries.
00:53:43 The point was that I think
00:53:45 it can, I feel like
00:53:47 as long as people,
00:53:49 like, I don't know actually whether weed
00:53:51 is addictive, like, cigarettes are.
00:53:53 I assume it isn't.
00:53:55 But, I feel like
00:53:57 it wouldn't be that big of a deal
00:53:59 if that just became a normal thing, because
00:54:01 you know, you just need to
00:54:03 anything to realize that
00:54:05 anything can be, like, self-destructive
00:54:07 and, like, can ruin your life
00:54:09 and make you retarded if you have too much of it.
00:54:11 I guess it's just like a thing.
00:54:13 You've got to make sure that people
00:54:15 in general learn
00:54:17 not to do big weed all the time, all day,
00:54:19 otherwise they won't be able to get anything done.
00:54:21 Uh, Digi, I'm happy that
00:54:23 you compared it to fast food, because that's actually
00:54:25 one of my points here. Fast food
00:54:27 is great every once in a while. You can walk into
00:54:29 Chipotle, and Chipotle is, like, one of the best
00:54:31 meals that I have, like, every single time.
00:54:33 It's great. I love Chipotle. But
00:54:35 if you eat too much of it, you're going to get fucking fat.
00:54:37 It's going to affect your overall health, and you're, like,
00:54:39 well-being. Like, socially, people are going to make fun of you because you're fat.
00:54:41 Or, rightfully so. It's going to affect you
00:54:43 economically, because you can't spend $10 a day
00:54:45 on fucking Chipotle. You can't do that.
00:54:47 Uh, you know, I mean,
00:54:49 that's true. Well, I'm saying you
00:54:51 probably should. Well, it's, it's, it's, it's
00:54:53 you could, you could make an argument, a sound argument.
00:54:55 That's a bad investment. And, like, like, the
00:54:57 perfect thing to do if you wanted to, even if you
00:54:59 want a delicious Chipotle burrito, if you
00:55:01 went to the grocery store, bought all the
00:55:03 ingredients, and cooked it yourself, it'll cost
00:55:05 you more time, for sure, but you'll definitely
00:55:07 save money by buying things in bulk and,
00:55:09 like, doing it that way. We're entering
00:55:11 a weird realm here, because I
00:55:13 don't think there's anybody
00:55:15 who is so broke
00:55:17 that they can't afford
00:55:19 to eat Chipotle every day, but
00:55:21 has enough money to smoke weed every
00:55:23 day. Like, I don't think this
00:55:25 person exists. Did you, I'm not saying
00:55:27 that they are literally incapable
00:55:29 of getting Chipotle every day.
00:55:31 I don't think they, they literally do not have the funds
00:55:33 to do so. I'm saying it's a smart
00:55:35 thing to do. I'm just saying, I'm just saying,
00:55:37 like, okay, in my case, for instance,
00:55:39 I could buy Chipotle every day
00:55:41 and it would do nothing to my bottom
00:55:43 line. Like, it, it is
00:55:45 inconsequential for me to spend that money
00:55:47 because I make way more money than
00:55:49 I can spend. Like, I
00:55:51 live such a small,
00:55:53 like, small life that has
00:55:55 nothing really behind it. I have a huge
00:55:57 savings, um, and
00:55:59 you know, every year a huge chunk of it gets taken
00:56:01 out for taxes and then it gets replaced. And
00:56:03 so, so, like,
00:56:05 for me, I could, yeah, I
00:56:07 could literally smoke weed or each chipotle
00:56:09 or do whatever the fuck I want every day
00:56:11 because, like, uh,
00:56:13 what is the reason not to do
00:56:15 that? You know, I, I, well, you know, I, most
00:56:17 people are not afforded. So, I'm speaking to the
00:56:19 audience. I mean, I think, I think what's
00:56:21 going on here is that you guys are talking
00:56:23 slightly about two different things, or at
00:56:25 least your, your emphasis is on two different aspects.
00:56:27 I think that's why there's a little bit of disagreement here.
00:56:29 I just feel like, if you,
00:56:31 I don't think there's anybody out there who like is
00:56:34 Smoking that amount of like nobody's smoking as much as I am if they can't afford it. It's what I'm saying like sure
00:56:40 Sure, I know multiple stoners that are constantly broke. Well, they're then they're fucking idiots
00:56:49 It's I would say that the weed is not their problem is the fact that they're fucking idiots that this their problem
00:56:55 I mean, you can make that point about spending their money on weed
00:56:59 Yeah, because they're I don't agree. I don't agree that they are also stupid. I do I they are stupid
00:57:05 I know is obviously not no, I would say any look literally
00:57:10 I'm trying if they can't afford it. That's the problem. Yeah, the thing is like there's people who do that
00:57:17 my fucking
00:57:19 My fiancee told me about someone she worked with who like her boyfriend had spent all his money on Pokemon plushies
00:57:27 Like he would literally get a paycheck and immediately drop it all on Pokemon plushies and be broke
00:57:35 She was like that too, yeah, I love you
00:57:45 People people literally just are bad with money because they don't understand it because probably their parents are bad with money
00:57:52 And just didn't teach them how to be good with it like the only reason I know anything about money is that my dad who was
00:57:59 Unbelievably bad with it and put himself in a massive amount of debt in his 30s
00:58:03 And then spent his 40s working his way out of all the debt and like learning everything about money and finances and taxes
00:58:10 He read literally the entire tax code. So I really should just get him to do my taxes fucking for me, but
00:58:16 So restraint because show restraint exactly
00:58:21 Like if you know how to show
00:58:23 Resuram show restaurant. Where's restaurant so overprotective of me
00:58:29 Like like basically if I if I stopped like if let's say my patreon took a dip to a point where I thought oh
00:58:36 Shit, I need to be worried about money now
00:58:38 We is the first thing that's got to go because it's what I spend the most frivolous money on like I know that it doesn't matter
00:58:44 How much I smoke I like I could smoke every fucking day and then the second I can't afford it anymore
00:58:49 It's fucking gone, you know
00:58:51 Well, I don't know if that's a proven fact that you could it's a very proven fact because I stopped drinking Mountain Dew
00:58:58 I stopped smoking cigarettes
00:59:00 I stopped doing all kinds of things that I was addicted to because well
00:59:03 I just thought that it was no longer appropriate cigarettes for like what like four months. I haven't smoked. I haven't smoked again since
00:59:10 Forever ago, I haven't smoked. Okay, you guys there. There is a difference here
00:59:14 You guys are basically talking past each other because there's two different things going on here
00:59:18 Munchie is talking about
00:59:20 Definitely positive possible negative things that could come from like being obsessed with weed and like the fact that there's addictive
00:59:26 Personalities like weed is just like like gambling we shouldn't like outlaw gambling but gambling can have negative consequences
00:59:32 Just by the nature of it existing but but digi here is focused on the positive that weed can do which I think we all agree
00:59:39 Exactly, I'm just saying that this this personality problem is not a result of any specific
00:59:45 Drug people will find a way to facilitate this personality problem
00:59:50 It goes way beyond like people talk about like gambling and weed and all that stuff because it's obvious
00:59:55 But like literally people will just blow their whole paychecks on fucking plushies like people will just spend their money
01:00:02 Badly because they're trying to fill a hole in their lives that they don't understand how to fill and they sure this is the way to do
01:00:07 It because they don't understand money. I
01:00:10 Completely agree. I don't disagree at all
01:00:11 But like last time so in the first cast we made fun people for making very getting fabulous commissions to spend all the American missions
01:00:17 Yeah, that's what I'm doing right here right now. I'm yeah, you should not do that. That's not yes
01:00:22 Do not spend all your money on weed if you cannot afford weed that's retarded
01:00:27 That might my main my main problem with the weed is is not the time or make a fucking budget
01:00:33 budget budget
01:00:36 Should I just to get into my big point get do it man. Let's do it. I'm ready
01:00:40 All right, all right when you can get high and feel good from just sitting on the couch like twiddling your clip playing the newest
01:00:46 Hottest like God of War two if you can do that
01:00:49 Dopamine for doing nothing your incentive to do like actually accomplish the things is diminished
01:00:54 You're not going to want to put in the hard work and do things that like really matter to me things that really matter to me
01:00:59 You're going to neglect other aspects of your life that make you feel good like social interaction work, etc
01:01:04 You can associate the dopamine rush that you get like from the high as rewards
01:01:08 You look at things that you've done or are doing currently and think wow good job. Like I'm so funny. I'm so much fun here and weed
01:01:14 I'm so smart. I bet no one would have thought of that Wow
01:01:17 When chances are it's either total bullshit and not good at all or the more like the scenario is it is good
01:01:23 But you just would have thought about it while you were sober and you're just more impressive than you otherwise would be
01:01:30 Hmm
01:01:32 So well, so basically you're making the case just like that that case kind of extends to just like something like video games as well
01:01:38 It's unearned indulgence. It's an indulgence and I don't I don't like the idea of pleasure for nothing
01:01:44 I mean, I agree
01:01:46 But the question like the question I think ultimately does come down to basically what we've been saying about like you've got to manage
01:01:52 That in your life because like weeds just out there and like weed or video games or any kind of drug or indulgence sex
01:01:58 Whatever it is not tell me that drugs are not more potent and easily well like literally released open mean in your brain
01:02:06 In the real world
01:02:09 You can you can get addicted to it like anything that that takes over your life because I don't
01:02:15 We don't even need to bring in anything else like the fact is that like weed as an example it
01:02:20 Alone it does do this, you know forget everything else forget drugs
01:02:23 It does do that and I can see why Munchie would see something like that and the effect it has on the on the world at
01:02:29 Large and think to himself well this you know, maybe there's some positives here
01:02:32 But I also see like a whole boatload of negatives coming along with it
01:02:36 I think that is understandable the the the idea that like you can take weed and then find like
01:02:43 The mundane stuff that you think to be like more impressive than it actually is
01:02:49 To be like that is literally our stereotype
01:02:56 Right now right now you constantly say that you're fun
01:03:00 You're on weed whenever I wait first of all, I don't even think I act what constantly was an overstatement
01:03:06 I don't think I even act any different whether I'm high or not. I don't think most people can tell
01:03:12 I don't think most people have any idea when it's the case
01:03:15 I mean, I hope well that it's been the case every single day since the year started
01:03:20 So if you just think I've acted literally different in every interaction
01:03:23 I've had with you since the beginning of the year than fair enough, but like you know
01:03:28 Well, it could be an overall sort of tonal shift, you know, I don't think that you're
01:03:33 Unrecognizable as did you bro, but I definitely I definitely like like notice a difference in your personality in general
01:03:40 I mean there is a difference in my personality, but it has nothing to do with weed it has like well
01:03:46 How would you know that though?
01:03:48 Because there's literally every single aspect of my life and my entire mindset has changed in the last
01:03:55 Okay, but that's that's hardly a scientific experiment though, you know, but also you started doing weed every day
01:04:01 So to say that I didn't know I think that my
01:04:05 Personality that I think yeah the changes to my demeanor that have been now. I don't know if this is what I'm trying to put you on trial
01:04:11 By the way, I'm just I'm just throwing I just want to say it
01:04:13 I don't I don't know if
01:04:15 Munchies time frame would align with other people's if he feels differently than than others who've expressed similar sentiments
01:04:21 however
01:04:22 Before the time where I started smoking like literally every day for the first like four or five months
01:04:28 I lived here. We were just smoked occasionally like maybe twice a week
01:04:32 Maybe it got up to like three times a week by the end of the year, you know
01:04:36 Because she was working a regular job
01:04:38 I was working doing shit all the time and I would talk about like weed in my videos
01:04:44 And I would make jokes about it in certain ones and in certain videos
01:04:47 I would say things like hey, you know, this is a high idea like this is an idea, but right
01:04:52 I had not actually been high and like any videos in that entire period until like a
01:05:00 Patron-exclusive like podcast release at the end of the year and people would say things like oh digi's so different when he's high
01:05:06 And I'm like, but I'm not high in any of the videos. I'm telling you about the experiences
01:05:10 I had while I was high. However, my personality is also different because I'm living a totally different lifestyle like I'm not a
01:05:18 Lonely weirdo in his room who feels bad all the time. I'm like, how do we get back to that? How do we get back to that?
01:05:25 I'm like a guy who's gonna go back to your roots, you know
01:05:28 Who's like having fun all the time and living well and and like just I
01:05:33 Just feel very different, you know from the way I did a year ago
01:05:37 And I think that what people don't understand and also the way I feel about weed is completely changed from that point because back then
01:05:44 Because we weren't smoking all the time. We did always get real high and we were like goofy and
01:05:51 Giggly and we'd watch a fucking Miyazaki movie and be like this is the greatest movie of all time
01:05:56 And then I'd watch a TV anime and be like all TV anime is garbage
01:05:59 I can't watch any of it like that's what it was like at the time
01:06:01 But I've completely desensitized myself to weed now like I'm high so often that it doesn't really have that much of an effect
01:06:09 it's more just like something that's fun to do and
01:06:12 It kind of lets me think a little faster and perceive things better like I've gotten better at following the plot of anime
01:06:18 I understood Ava way better when I've watched it high. Let me tell you that
01:06:24 Boy, it's just a lot easier for me to parse information because I've historically been terrible at following stories and shows like if you watch my critique
01:06:32 You'll you'll find that I rarely talk about like specific story elements because I literally don't remember a lot of the times
01:06:38 I can't even remember the main character's name. I just call him like the protagonist, you know
01:06:42 Yeah, I've gotten so much better at that just because I can slow down and like really take it all in so I
01:06:47 Prefer to watch anime high because I literally think I get it more and like I can also see things like I can tell the difference between the
01:06:55 Foreground and background better and I can judge them on different levels and things like that, you know, it's easier to
01:07:01 Identify each individual element of the production and that's an inarguable
01:07:05 Like how could I say like no you don't experience this better?
01:07:08 That's completely fine and valid way of thinking you like how you are better well high
01:07:13 But I'm saying for the general people
01:07:15 I don't like like like I don't want to condone or approve of that type of behavior
01:07:20 Because well, you might feel the same way that Digi does. There are also the many other various different
01:07:27 Things that I've said that I think are negatives about weed and also I can have my also own
01:07:32 Inarguable point that I just don't like people who are on weed. You can't say well, no, you just do people like people on weed
01:07:38 I just I just
01:07:41 Trying to like
01:07:43 Quell your argument that you don't like people on weed. That's completely fine
01:07:46 The only reason I'm arguing so strongly is that I'd want to encourage people to smoke weed because I see I
01:07:55 Think smoking weed will
01:07:57 Can make your life better if you are smart about it and you have someone guiding you and teaching you like how to do it
01:08:05 Well and to not
01:08:07 Digi, I don't even really disagree
01:08:10 It can make your life better if you use it in casual
01:08:15 Intervals if you use it it not every day if you can use it not regularly if you just use it as you know what workers really hard today
01:08:22 I haven't smoked and like, you know a little while. I'll just kick back tonight, you know, tonight's I just want to relax
01:08:27 I can't argue against that. I wouldn't want to argue against that. That's earned, you know, you've put it in work
01:08:32 You know, you've come home after work. I understand I get it. It's a casual
01:08:36 But what if I'm saying that like yeah, that's okay. If you're someone who's in a life situation where that is best
01:08:42 Yes, that I agree if you're someone who's in a life situation, however, like mine where getting high all the time will help you
01:08:50 Do it all the time and like, you know, use it in the way that's appropriate just like you would any other tool
01:08:55 That's what they're there for, you know, I
01:08:58 Mean, yeah, I totally agree that like all that there's there's no case that it should like be illegal or anything of that
01:09:04 It's just don't get it. I just I just don't get what it brings. It's never it's never like drugs or alcohol have never like improved
01:09:12 I've never felt good that I did them afterwards
01:09:16 Did you hear making his case, you know, that's
01:09:21 Would you consider your regular waking existence to be an utter nightmare. Yes
01:09:27 Proves that all from doing either of those substances temporarily, but I'm saying that afterwards
01:09:33 Like I can temporarily forget about what is my existence that that's actually brilliant
01:09:39 After you know, sorry bad. Sorry. I was saying but but but afterwards looking back. It's not better
01:09:44 Yeah, I don't feel better because I did it did you do you agree with him what Ben just said
01:09:49 Do you share that sentiment that your life existence is a waking nightmare? Etc. Etc. I would say I
01:09:55 Would not say that
01:09:56 however
01:09:59 How would I put this I I think that I have a tendency to get lost in thought
01:10:07 You know like and if I don't have anything to sort of guide me and focus me
01:10:14 Then I'm not gonna go into a good place, you know, and there's there's multiple ways to go about making sure that doesn't happen
01:10:22 Interact with somebody that will protect you from thinking, you know
01:10:26 Watch something consume something analyze something create something, you know get absorbed in your creation
01:10:34 Do something basically, it's what I'm saying if you're not doing anything then life is misery. However
01:10:40 Yeah, if you are in a situation like the one that I was in like this is more about
01:10:46 drinking really for me than than weed because I handled them kind of differently, but when I was a
01:10:51 Before before moving out and all I was drinking all the fucking time you guys remember I've had a historically
01:10:57 People used to constantly
01:10:59 Intervention me about how they thought I was drinking too much and I would go no
01:11:02 It's not like that because if you look up what actual alcoholism is
01:11:05 It's fucking terrifying and it's nothing like what I do
01:11:08 But but I did drink a fair amount and the reason is that sometimes I would be in a position where there was just nothing
01:11:14 I could do like no one was around for me to hang out with there was nowhere to go because it's too late at night
01:11:21 My sleep schedule is fucked up. I like either don't have a project or I'm stuck on the project and I just was like well
01:11:28 Nothing's happening. I feel like shit. I don't know how to continue the rest of the night
01:11:33 Like I don't know what I can change
01:11:35 Other than I can make my mind feel different by consuming this beverage that changes the way my mind feels and I can't predict
01:11:43 What's gonna come out of that? Maybe it's gonna make me feel even worse
01:11:46 Maybe it's gonna make me feel better. Maybe I'll feel productive
01:11:48 Maybe I'll put on the dick show and have three beers. It'll be a great night
01:11:51 You know, I'll rewatch something I love and just imbibe and and and take a step back
01:11:57 And that's why I drank so much at the time. The reason and I smoke so much now
01:12:03 Is more that I am living a an intense existence. I am doing
01:12:10 Everything all the time. I've got
01:12:13 Thousands of people who are talking to me all the time and I decided like at the end of last year
01:12:18 I had briefly decided to hole up and just be like no, I'm abandoning discord. I'm abandoning Twitter
01:12:23 I'm closing my comments and then I decided fuck it. I'm gonna go back into battle
01:12:27 And so I opened it all back up and now I'm constantly talking to people. I'm collabing with everybody
01:12:33 I'm paying everyone to do stuff for me. I've got a million things going on. I've got a thousand anime to watch
01:12:38 I'm you know with somebody all the time
01:12:41 You know much more physically active than before as a result. So
01:12:46 Yeah, I'm wearing myself out is basically what I'm saying and to keep all that together to hold it all together
01:12:52 Requires it just constant stream of like mind-altering
01:12:57 Substances that will change the way I feel in a subtle way throughout the course of the day that makes it feel like I
01:13:04 Reset again. I've got energy again. You know, it's like oh, I took I got high again
01:13:09 Now I can edit the rest of this video. Oh, I drank another beer now
01:13:13 I can do this and like because
01:13:15 Getting high is like I'm just way more potent effect than drinking is like you can get way higher way faster than you can get drunk
01:13:22 So it's just a really effective way to constantly shake things up and reset your sort of mental clock and you know
01:13:29 That's why I smoke all the time
01:13:30 I don't really think it changes the actual products that I create that much
01:13:35 Because the reason that the stuff I make has changed so much has nothing to do with the weed
01:13:39 It has to do with just that I started watching lots of really good stuff while I was smoking weed
01:13:45 And I took a lot away from it, you know and decided that I thought my content was just shit
01:13:50 Like my content was something I couldn't watch high because it's boring. So like let's make it interesting, you know
01:13:56 Well at that right there, you're showing that we is affected what you like how you perceive things
01:14:01 It's affected watch your it affected how I perceive things is that it made me a
01:14:06 Elitist who did not want to watch anything bad like all I watched when we started smoking weed like all I could watch was
01:14:12 Hiyami Izaki and like Jesse's videos and I got I got I had a total ego death watching demos
01:14:19 Like last three videos that he made that were like astonishingly good and I couldn't believe I'd ever said I was better than him
01:14:25 You know like but then I watched the rest of his videos and I decided I was better than him
01:14:30 But like you know those three videos are godly and well, okay, okay?
01:14:34 That was an interesting an interesting thing, but here comes neurotypical Nate to neurotypical explain
01:14:39 All your bullshit away. So that was very interesting. My Michelle calls me neurotypical Nate's a very
01:14:46 So it's it's pretty good. She's literally shaming my normal brain
01:14:50 But that's that's what's interesting about this because the way that you're approaching it is
01:14:56 PCP fan because like the idea of like calling people
01:14:59 Neurally atypical is like a meme that I do and oh, yeah, nobody's caught on except I guess her now
01:15:05 Yeah, she's figuring this shit out. So like we start I started by asking and Ben described the existence as a nightmare
01:15:11 I mean you didn't quite agree with that, but basically you said that you use, you know drugs use use alcohol use
01:15:17 You know weed now to like modify your existence
01:15:20 Which is exactly what drug is for so that you can like achieve the things you want to achieve now that I would never tell anybody
01:15:26 They can't do that and that's all fine
01:15:27 But I would say that personally like the hardware and software that I'm running in my body makes me say
01:15:35 definitively existence isn't is far from a nightmare
01:15:38 I I am at my most happy when I am sober and working on stuff, you know, I don't feel I agree
01:15:45 I would say that the drug life is the wrong life and this is not how I want to raise my kids
01:15:50 Like that's my point. Yeah
01:15:52 But because I'm not raising kids right now, you know, he's free
01:15:56 He's not only am I not raising kids
01:15:57 But like our audience are adults now and they're already fucked like their parents already fucked up
01:16:03 Like you're listening to the PCP your parents fucked up bad like
01:16:08 Normie life is over. First of all first of all your life is definitely hard because you're trans and everything
01:16:15 And
01:16:20 You kind of need this
01:16:27 Donate to our patron if you're neurotypical
01:16:30 Do I turn patron if your dad failed you don't take our patron if your dad ran away from home
01:16:34 Don't don't do our patron if you didn't grow up with the father figure. Well, so so this now this is cool
01:16:40 Like what it comes down to is like if you need okay, like this this would be my ideal scenario
01:16:45 I don't know if this is realistic. I don't know if this is even possible
01:16:47 But like I was a broken terrible human being when I was young and somewhere along the line
01:16:53 I developed the capacity to work really hard and put in a lot of hours to do things I want
01:16:58 I don't know exactly when that came where that came from
01:17:00 It started sometime after I started doing like t-bap stuff and was able to talk to women
01:17:06 Okay, at some point something changed in me and what I personally would ideally want definitely not realistic
01:17:13 But I would prefer if people could somehow
01:17:16 Make this change in themselves that simply doesn't rely on a substance to be that way
01:17:22 And so that they're they're happy all the time and I know that like I take caffeine
01:17:27 So it's it's kind of hypocritical to say that because I do consume caffeine. It is a drug
01:17:31 It you know makes me more energetic sometimes when it and it's helpful
01:17:34 So even I am not like the perfect ideal, but like that that's like my my platonic
01:17:40 Form like there's a human being who just goes through his life
01:17:43 And he doesn't need any substances outside of what he wakes up in the morning with he eats right he exercises
01:17:48 That's why I guess that's why I wish that I could say it was straight edge. I wish that I was yeah
01:17:54 You know like I think I was a I think if I was a better person
01:17:57 I wouldn't indulge
01:17:59 It's Jesse we're here he'd be going hard on the loving the straight edge the lifestyle the normal life
01:18:05 Jesse we're still with us today
01:18:14 I mean coping sounds judgmental and I'm not
01:18:18 I don't know if you can necessarily solve the problem because like doing what Nate does
01:18:23 Requires constant maintenance. You just have to learn to love that
01:18:27 Like you have to like you have to feel that your body is like it's worth it
01:18:31 It's worth the upkeep because it you know makes you feel so good
01:18:34 And by the way like the thing I love doing of like coming home making videos that I devote all my time to like even I didn't like
01:18:42 Work hard to discover that I just I committed to doing some videos with Ben and somewhere along the way
01:18:47 My body just awoke to the fact that it simply enjoyed doing this like I didn't like achieve anything
01:18:54 I just like my body just enjoys doing this kind of online work
01:18:58 So I don't even really give myself credit for that. It's just I feel like this is a really
01:19:03 I'm just so happy about life and everything feels great
01:19:06 That's what everybody said to have that well big part of why like not more people go down this route that you're that you've gone
01:19:12 Down is that for people who've never really been healthy
01:19:16 It's difficult to relate to that sentiment of like the idea that you just feel better because like again
01:19:22 I grew up on like shit food my whole life and yeah
01:19:25 When I like discovered what healthy food was and like that feeling of like cuz I've tried to do the health-kick thing for a while
01:19:32 And like yeah, it makes you feel fucking like
01:19:34 Weirdly amazing like you get a lot of energy
01:19:37 That's what humans are supposed to feel like. Yeah, what the fuck is this?
01:19:41 Like how is like I didn't know like it's just you don't really understand what food is supposed to be because you've never been fed it before
01:19:47 It's like how yeah, yeah, but guys I
01:19:50 Know I literally don't eat sugar everyone. I'm going off sugar for I'm throwing in on the trash
01:19:55 No sugar for a fucking week till the next PCP. I'm making a commitment right now. I'm not doing it. Everyone. Let's be healthy
01:20:02 Let's live. Let's truly live everyone. Fuck. Yeah, there's a while there
01:20:07 I've sadly fallen off the wagon and it's really disappointing and you know what day I'm gonna join you
01:20:11 I'm not going to drink any soda or energy drinks. Yes. That's what I'm talking about
01:20:15 For a while for a while there
01:20:17 I wasn't drinking any soda for like like like from like August up until like like December or something or like around there
01:20:25 But I remember there's one moment
01:20:26 There's one fucking moment where I was at it was at it was at your house and I think you saw saw this happen
01:20:33 Where we were leaving Wingstop and like there's just some sort of like impulse in my mind
01:20:39 There was some sort of like weird like like phantom of sodas past and yeah
01:20:44 I was pouring out my drink and then like I didn't like it was so fast
01:20:48 I like my body acted on I didn't even cognitively think about it
01:20:51 I just like got a little like like a tiny sip of
01:20:55 Orange of orange juice like no
01:20:58 Chugged it as fast as I could and then I was like, what did I just do?
01:21:04 What just happened?
01:21:06 Remember that yeah
01:21:07 Yeah, um, it was you know, it was sad. It was like it was like that episode of the Simpsons where um
01:21:12 Where Homer and Barney get picked for the space program and Barney excels
01:21:16 He gives up alcohol and he gets really healthy
01:21:18 And then like he he makes it to the end of the program and he's going into space
01:21:22 And then they celebrate with a beer and once a beer his eyes go all crazy and he says oh god
01:21:26 It starts and he goes nuts and he and he runs and he runs out jumps out the window and the scientist says I don't understand it
01:21:33 That was non-alcoholic beer, but it's just the idea. There was a seed in his brain
01:21:38 You know like it wasn't the beer itself, you know, it was the the addiction or the dopamine or the or the I don't know
01:21:44 The headspace to put him in or something. Yeah
01:21:47 We gotta fight we gotta fight our weak biology
01:21:50 We have to break our body man is both the sculptor and the sculpture every change will will will wreak agony upon your whole body
01:21:56 But that's how you make yourself into a better human being and a more perfect form. You have to carve yourself everybody
01:22:03 That's a well that's a well-known old adage
01:22:07 Yeah, there was a guy coming down the alleyway and he was a skinhead Yobo sort of lad
01:22:12 He looked at me and he smirked and he said do you want some weed and I looked down on my feet
01:22:18 And I looked in like glancing his eyes. I looked away and said no
01:22:21 Thank you and then he scoffed and they walked away and I felt bad. I felt emasculated
01:22:28 And that's that's my weed story everybody. Is that true?
01:22:31 Yeah, oh cool
01:22:33 I was in an alleyway and a guy was gonna offer me weed and he was a young man
01:22:36 He looked like he was bigger than me and he was a fucking freak and and and I had my stupid hair
01:22:42 And I was like, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if I would trust no, thank you, sir. You know, yeah
01:22:46 Yeah, I don't want my weed from an alley. Yeah, I trust alley
01:22:50 OOP
01:22:55 Get give give what's alley OOP stance on the weed
01:22:59 She doesn't have a mouth so it doesn't really
01:23:02 So she's injecting
01:23:08 That's why she's white
01:23:09 She's just bleached pale from all the bleach. She's injected into your hands. You inject cocaine, right? Yes
01:23:16 Okay, where are we going with this? Are we?
01:23:18 I just want to I want to give my yeah, I'll give my big my last thing
01:23:23 I want to say word because Nate your lifestyle
01:23:26 Your lifestyle of healthiness like I really look up to it and I want to capture it
01:23:31 Like I want to be that guy not necessarily the beans shit, but like
01:23:39 The thing is my dad is somebody who in
01:23:42 When I was like a kid and he was in like his early 30s
01:23:46 He got real fat and like he was balding and he just kind of looked like shit for a little while
01:23:51 And he had been like a real handsome dude like he if you look at him pictures of him. He was young
01:23:55 He was fucking beautiful. He looked like Tom Cruise and like he he got fat and old as you do and then he like
01:24:02 Fucking was like this is bullshit. Like I'm not gonna be like this anymore. So like at age 35
01:24:08 He got like
01:24:09 Unbelievably shredded like he looked amazing. He was like, you know fucking bench pressing over 300 pounds and shit at age
01:24:16 35, you know, and like I don't know what it is
01:24:19 But there's something about the like 30s to 40s range where guys just seem to develop the will it's because your body
01:24:26 Starts giving out. That's why that's yeah because yeah
01:24:29 I know it's coming because the reason my dad every single time my dad's quit something
01:24:33 It's because he was told he had to like he used to drink real bad and as a result of drinking
01:24:39 He would smoke and he literally be developed an allergy to alcohol and couldn't drink anymore because it would give him like really bad
01:24:45 Anxiety attacks. So like but now that he quit like he's healthier than he was before
01:24:50 He quit smoking now. He's a vegan and it's like you you have time you always have a chance
01:24:56 You just but you you got to know that you can do it because if you let yourself get used to being like a fucking fat ass
01:25:02 And you just never learn how to fucking be healthy
01:25:04 You're not gonna be able to suddenly save yourself at age 40
01:25:07 But like you got develop that discipline the way I see it my my current plan is like just we're about to move to Boston
01:25:14 I'm gonna spend the next three years like slimming. I'm gonna lose like 30 pounds and just keep it off
01:25:19 I'm not gonna stop doing any drugs or anything like that. Then I'm gonna have kids then I'm gonna probably stop doing drugs learn Japanese
01:25:26 After we've established PCP HQ and it's like taken off then I'm gonna go establish the Japan branch of PCP PCP
01:25:36 The Boston branch and I'll go to the Japanese yeah, that sounds great
01:25:40 Yeah, this is my 10-year plan and once I'm in Japan because of the fact that you don't like drive anywhere
01:25:46 You just run. I'll just fucking run everywhere. You just run. Everyone in Japan is sprinting
01:25:56 Oh, we know now they're doing the devil man dash. Yeah
01:26:06 Like bullet trains are actually on Flintstones technology, sir
01:26:10 You have just like run with yeah, like like there's there's really fast actually since since devil man crybaby came out
01:26:16 There's been a massive stratification in society between the narrator runners and the devil man dashers
01:26:20 It's pretty massive racial and social tension right now. Do you guys know about the Brazilian Naruto run?
01:26:26 No, okay. There's a national event in Brazil
01:26:30 We're like 40,000 people fill the streets and Naruto run for like miles be ours. What the hell are they doing down there?
01:26:37 It's real and there's YouTube videos of it. So show credible get that shit. That's not even a good way to run
01:26:45 Yes come to Brazil
01:26:51 Okay, my final word to the will of the deceased is this
01:26:59 There are other ways to feel good. There are other ways to have that dopamine rush and I because I'm me
01:27:07 Value hard work. I value social connection. I value going outside. I value taking up a hobby
01:27:13 I value learning an instrument
01:27:15 I value things like that as opposed to doing nothing and sitting on your ass a smoking weed in your bedroom
01:27:21 And I value productive
01:27:23 you know aspects of society and that's the kind of people who I want to surround myself by because that's what I respect and
01:27:28 That's what I admire
01:27:29 So I don't want to be your friend if you're a stoner who wastes all of your money on weed and then just sits on you know
01:27:36 His ass I watching you know anime or you know fucking playing video game
01:27:40 I don't care about that. I don't care about any of that shit
01:27:43 I want to be around people who I like people who I like aren't so this is like completely side-side like this is just like the
01:27:50 The arguments that I can argue. I can't argue
01:27:53 I just don't like being around stoners because I don't like the way they smell or like the stereotype of a stoner
01:27:58 Which is real and I've encountered them. I don't like and I think they're annoying. I can't really argue that I can't argue
01:28:03 Dopamine rush incentives reward, whatever the fuck. I'm sure yeah. Well, you can make your case
01:28:08 I agree with that stance. I think you you should definitely not get shallow rewards
01:28:13 Chase the big I'd say because there's more rules say anybody who likes dark souls. You already fucking know
01:28:19 You already know approach your life like dark souls. It'll be just a satisfying
01:28:23 That's the best thing I've ever heard
01:28:26 Here's here's my okay. I've got I've got a life rule to go by for this
01:28:30 So I of course I feel a lot of empathy for the guys that like did you mentioned about like like if you live in like a fucking ghetto
01:28:37 There's nothing going like you don't know about you can't work on your entrepreneurial internet YouTube career or whatever
01:28:41 You've got nothing going on. I that's just an example
01:28:45 It's just an example
01:28:45 And it like it if you've got if you if your life is hell and the weed is your one escape and it is I get it
01:28:51 No matter what no matter who you are then then I get then who the fuck am I to criticize how you do
01:28:56 But I would always say have a have your goals in mind
01:29:00 You know, maybe your life is complete hell and there's no chance that I'm like well fair enough get high every single day
01:29:05 I mean, what do you gotta do? But I don't believe that's the case for almost everyone
01:29:09 So try to work on a plan to get yourself where you want to be I think most people just don't have like any
01:29:16 Ambitions they don't they need to be reminded that they can achieve something with their life
01:29:22 Ambitions, but they should yeah, I look for it. Yeah. Yeah
01:29:26 Well a a a lot of people don't have ambitions, but they should but be a lot of people don't like
01:29:32 Understand that they can achieve things
01:29:34 Mm-hmm, you know like I didn't feel like I could achieve anything until maybe a couple years ago sure
01:29:41 I'm sure like everyone is like that's the only reason to become an adult. Yeah, but my mind
01:29:47 What are you gonna do like how?
01:29:49 Well, I don't know. I don't know. I will I will I will say that what I believe that stuff
01:29:54 That's all do that I I will give people a vision of a better future for themselves by not being just a stoner and nothing else
01:30:01 I'd like I think that's sincere fucking you can make something yourself
01:30:05 You can you can achieve you can achieve great things if you put your mind to it like anyone can I believe it
01:30:10 And if you use weed just to relax every once in a while and you're still a productive guy
01:30:14 Then what the fuck just do whatever the fuck you want man. Like who cares it's fine. It's yeah
01:30:19 More power to you. I just think that like like
01:30:22 This is one of those things where it's like the act unit of self. I don't like but you could say well, you know
01:30:28 It's not that bad, you know, you know, he's just he's just having fun on the couch
01:30:31 You know, whatever the hell but I think this this happens a lot where doing an action is
01:30:39 Like indicative of the kind of person you are and your morals and beliefs
01:30:43 We're sure I feel like you have to be a certain type of person to even want to become a stoner
01:30:49 Who does weed all the time and just sits on the couch? I think you
01:30:53 Things about you. I think yeah about you if that's the way that you use the drug
01:30:57 Like if you are that type of stoner and yet you're a fucking like you deserve the stereotype because
01:31:04 Like it is a bad thing to be, you know, you know, I just just to go way back a little bit
01:31:12 When I find casually the last time that I did weed I was visiting friends in around Seattle in Redmond, Washington and
01:31:19 Like we did weed it was fine
01:31:22 Like there's a guy who's a big weed guy and like what what happened to me was that I just we were watching Tim and Eric and
01:31:28 It was an episode I had seen many times and just this time
01:31:31 I found it a thousand times funnier than I ever had before and don't get me wrong
01:31:36 That was an enjoyable experience except I became very self-conscious
01:31:40 About how it wasn't as funny to everyone else as it was to me and that to me was embarrassing because I have this
01:31:48 That feel like you get embarrassed that you're enjoying yourself and you know that it's because of the weed and it's like oh no
01:31:54 This is so uncomfortable
01:31:55 Like I want to observe the world as closely to objectively as possible because that's just like the way you can make a
01:32:03 Change and sculpt the world you want, but you know what that's just a fun story. That's fine
01:32:07 I it wasn't a crazy thing wasn't a big deal, but here's a life rule everybody
01:32:11 This is my this is Nate's hot tip for drug use
01:32:14 Never be the biggest stoner in your friend group. That's my life tip and if you follow that one simple rule
01:32:21 I think yeah things will go. I mean that would just lead you to going into groups with bigger stoners
01:32:27 Oh, no, it's gonna start an arms race. It's a big stoner and a small bitch
01:32:30 I like to think that it'll it'll just make everybody move away. Alright, I want to get us into a to the questions now
01:32:37 Let's do it. Let's do it. Oh, yeah
01:32:39 Okay, shoot shoot shoot. I get
01:32:42 More high from taking a chunky bite out of a soft white like spongy
01:32:50 crusty bread, okay, then I do in any amount of alcohol
01:32:57 Use yeast for bread not beer
01:33:04 Hashtag save the yeast everybody. Okay question one is from Mozilla fennec and zero who asks
01:33:10 Do you have to prepare yourself to record a script or a podcast in any way? Yeah, dude. I got a smoke a huge
01:33:22 Bubbly bubbly bubbly ball. I have to turn off my real self. There it is any podcast
01:33:29 You have never seen me as my real self and unless we're in person
01:33:34 Even I don't I don't generally like write scripts or take notes about things but like
01:33:42 I don't know if it counts as prep
01:33:43 But the times that I've recorded like a rant like a rant video or like a you know like a ramble video
01:33:49 I will yeah, I don't like prep for it
01:33:52 So I mean or maybe a little bit but mostly I just I start recording and then I'll just stop
01:33:56 I'll just redo it a bunch of times like until I'm sure
01:33:59 Yeah, yeah
01:34:01 In the show notes, you will find my my notes for this very podcast you listen to right now. Oh
01:34:07 Nice nice check that out
01:34:10 I I used to prepare notes for the PCP, but I've just found that I'm just so good
01:34:15 I don't need to that's that's my real thoughts on the matter though for like every other video
01:34:20 I I don't think they meant like notes wise like just prepare yourself to record a script or podcasted
01:34:27 Yeah, more like you know what I get in the mood
01:34:30 You know what I do. Yeah, this is the thing I always do
01:34:32 I never drink like milk or orange juice or anything like that before a podcast because it fucks up your throat
01:34:38 You gotta be able to the only good thing drink water tea. Yeah tea is good water water doesn't help me water makes me like
01:34:46 Some reason doesn't work. He does though. I don't know. Maybe it's just because it's warm, but that helps
01:34:51 Yeah, that helps I've actually meditated on this a little bit cuz for a long time. I I was thinking I was meditating on the issue
01:34:59 Why am I better on arm shield than I am on the PCP?
01:35:02 Why am I more likeable on arm shield than I am on the PCP and on and all of the many reasons I've come back with this as
01:35:08 Well, it's later in the day
01:35:10 It's like at night we record like at night
01:35:12 And so if I had more times like go throughout the day and you'll get all my groggy the sound get on my drowsiness out
01:35:17 And I've been able to like you know, you know
01:35:19 Get a whole bunch of water and by get hydrated and shit
01:35:22 I've been able to you know get some energy and I've been able to expend that on the podcast as opposed to the PCP where I woke up
01:35:28 Before just like like an hour for the podcast and I still feel like I want to die
01:35:32 It's interesting you say that because I think the opposite is true for me of the PCP that part of why I'm able to have so much
01:35:40 On arm retrieval what no I'm just saying that like I just meant that like the opposite is true for me in terms of
01:35:46 What time of day is more convenient to record a podcast because like if I record the PCP relatively early
01:35:54 It's like I haven't had the time to exhaust all my ideas yet today
01:35:57 So I'm like excited to talk because that's what I like doing is talking
01:36:01 Yeah, and by the end of the day like sometimes when I do the pub crawl because it's at 11 p.m
01:36:06 On Mondays and almost always by that point on Monday
01:36:11 I've already made a bunch of shit and like talked about most of the things I had to say or I have to do another like
01:36:16 I'm about to do a patreon podcast after it or something like that
01:36:20 So I don't want to say too much because then I have to have more to say on that it's just like as the day wears on
01:36:25 You know each new podcast it's gonna be more exhausted because I've already been talking all day because even if I don't record anything
01:36:32 I was definitely talking all day, you know
01:36:37 Fair enough I got I got nothing else to say on that
01:36:41 Yo, let's check out. Yeah, you've got a question
01:36:43 Yeah, I'm gonna check right now
01:36:45 But hold on I'm checking the patreon lounge right now just like just like the at like like actual real patreon lounge chat
01:36:51 Yeah, what I have found right here. This is a this is a straw pole. This is a
01:36:57 Which member of the PCP do you look up to the most? I'm gonna check the results right now. Oh shit
01:37:01 Oh, dude, I mean you are tied Nate mean you are tied. We are both tied with eight votes

01:37:55 I see main character girl standing in the Gainax pose. What is this implying?
01:38:00 What does this mean and maybe that maybe they'll fucking have a Gainax reference in there or something?
01:38:06 I mean, I know it was in the goddamn TV show, so
01:38:10 Okay, sorry, I just saw that and it was weird. So okay moving on moving I would like to see that is what I'm
01:38:16 I'll have to watch the show and then do that. Yes. That has to be in the show notes now, so

01:39:00 Here's a quiz a question. Okay, like Cappy from the patron lounge
01:39:03 What is your favorite thing on the internet? This is very much like like what is a recent internet going on?
01:39:08 I believe they're saying oh
01:39:11 What is really there's an okay? Yeah, go ahead. There is a podcast came out by my hero and idol
01:39:17 Yon Renkowski aka 91. It's called radio pro seconds on whiz dumb gun
01:39:24 I'll look in the description obviously and it is an absolute experience
01:39:29 I've fallen in love with yon all over again his wit and humor and just on the fly like rants and promos
01:39:36 That he cuts just just on like like stoners and like juggalos and cyber vermin are just an utter fucking treat
01:39:43 And I'm so happy. I was really worried. This is gonna be like. Hello. It's me yon renkowski
01:39:48 I made a thing in the past and now I'm a wash-up internet creator
01:39:51 This is my life and I'm just going to sell to you Brit landly because I have a podcast show
01:39:55 That's what everyone does now, right? But no yon is not he is
01:39:59 Ceaseless and it's advancement in performance artistry. He has so many weird fucking unique gimmets like in the first episode
01:40:07 He he has like he sets up an interview with a crisis actor
01:40:12 Who who like like was one of the people who acted on the set of the Syrian Civil War?
01:40:18 What interviews him about about how the series war was staged wait
01:40:23 The whole thing it's fucking incredible. Yeah, it got damn radio Prozac absolutely incredible
01:40:29 I love it dearly and it just reminds me how much Barry Collin to be and it's really inspires me to be a better person
01:40:35 That's fantastic. Oh also. What was the question that inspired that answer?
01:40:38 Uh, it was what is your favorite thing on the internet at this very moment?
01:40:42 Okay, I have an answer. Yeah shoot. Um, it's the fucking it's the fucking rowdy fuckers juvenile detention
01:40:50 The slime economy should be coming online today or tomorrow. Yeah, the slime economy will be live
01:40:57 We have been workshopping it. We have been I we I watched I watched the economy crash and burn
01:41:02 I watched slime credits worth fall to zero as people lost faith in their society
01:41:08 They had to be replaced with a new with a new currency, but we are we're yes
01:41:13 It's it lives the world lives munchie
01:41:17 It's a living breathing place
01:41:19 How's it feel to be a whole four mega slimes behind me at this point? What the hell is going on?
01:41:25 What happened to the cop killers? It's embarrassed. Yeah, the the shit the cop killers were on top of their game
01:41:30 But then like the rowdies have just the rowdies have just have just embraced bots and just basic
01:41:37 Cowards. Yeah, well, there's no rule
01:41:41 You can easily kill a body could easily kill one, but the
01:41:45 The fucking killers were just so lazy and incompetent that they just couldn't foresee what the rise we're doing the cop killers
01:41:52 Look the cop killers don't employ cowardly tactics, but I tell you what they do employ
01:41:57 massive economic stratagems and when
01:42:00 They do and who else what was was like the first real bot then B dash Evan the fucking notorious killer
01:42:08 So don't give me that shit you fucking cock. I'll kill you. I'll kill you
01:42:14 You're done off to the combat zone right now first
01:42:17 I'm gonna kill you and then I'm gonna I'm gonna suicide and then I'm gonna go kill the Lord of Ghosts just to make a point
01:42:24 I kill them once and I can kill them again
01:42:27 I'll tell you I this is a small thing my favorite thing on the internet at this very moment
01:42:32 Legibly the first thing that comes to mind is the gaming Brits new video on the new God of War
01:42:37 I liked it a lot way to go chas you're killing it. That's it. That's my whole answer
01:42:41 It was good also in case you're not aware he like has a history like
01:42:46 Action games are like his wheelhouse and he made a video that was real famous of the first like the trailer for this
01:42:52 And I've both had famous videos about the trailer of God of War that's that said almost the same thing
01:42:57 But his was like a proper video and mine was me doing the Gilbert Godfrey depression for half an hour
01:43:04 The game in Britain is making me feel bad about like how good his content is and I got a
01:43:10 Right away does he like the game or not because I've been hearing it's actually great
01:43:14 The summary of spoiling your video chat. Sorry about that
01:43:17 But like every it's been a week by the time it's been out now
01:43:19 He just says that like
01:43:21 Everyone's like been telling him and commenting on his video like you were wrong
01:43:24 The video is getting 10 of 10s across the board every journalist loves it
01:43:28 Meanwhile, his point was journalists will love this game excessively
01:43:32 So like he's just like yeah, like of course it's getting 10 of 10s from these journalists
01:43:37 The game is exactly as not great as I as I feared it would be and it's boring and like yeah
01:43:43 It's not it's not it's not the DMC that he would wish you know it to be or whatever
01:43:47 So, of course. Yep. It's what it's basically what he predicted. You killed it boy. You killed it
01:43:51 Well, um, I've my favorite thing to come out recently was fucking mania madness
01:43:56 From our good friend endless Jess who fucking covered. Yeah, that was great
01:44:01 And it was like it he ended up turning it into unintentionally this like epic
01:44:07 Fucking weekend spanning event just like mania itself because I guess he recorded like a five-hour podcast and released it in 30 minute
01:44:15 Chunks that he was releasing over the course of days. I love that. I loved it
01:44:20 It was so good. I think I should check it out
01:44:23 It should watch the whole thing start to finish like I'll tell you because back in the day
01:44:27 Jesse had the drowning and kayfabe channel and that's how I got in any interest in wrestling at all was I would listen to these hours
01:44:33 long wrestling podcast and even though it was just like Jesse on a couch in front of a camera and like
01:44:39 rambling like you know
01:44:41 Like constantly undercutting himself and stopping to talk about how he has no idea he's talked about and stuff like that
01:44:46 You know that was like the first true rambling vlog
01:44:50 I ever enjoyed where I was like wow like he's just such a good storyteller that I don't even care that this is just a guy sitting
01:44:57 On a couch like rambling at me because this is fucking fascinating stuff
01:45:02 And I want to hear about it. So now he's doing it again
01:45:06 And I haven't cared about wrestling in the last year and a half because he hasn't been able to fucking talk about it
01:45:11 So I haven't heard anything about it
01:45:13 Learned all the new stories. It's like three hours of fucking it feels like watching a TV show because it's 30 minute chunks and like
01:45:21 If you watch them over the course of days
01:45:23 It's like you're slowly marathoning through this epic series that has like this amazing
01:45:27 Climax to it and everything all these huge moments because it's like the most exciting WrestleMania of all time and
01:45:33 He cut out like it's highly edited instead of being him in front of a camera
01:45:38 There's like it's just like images on screen like a long time, but like the audio is highly edited
01:45:43 I mean to let you know
01:45:45 It gives you exactly what you need and like in order to understand if you would watch this WrestleMania
01:45:50 Like you would need someone like Jesse there explaining everything happening. Yeah, why yeah, so just having it presented this way
01:45:57 For for guys like us. I think is like the best way to do it. Oh, yeah
01:46:03 Like literally watching everything you just watching the good part of wrestling
01:46:07 Exactly all you gotta do is then just go watch a YouTube video of the actual fight
01:46:11 So you can see the moves and like I mean he puts half of them on screen
01:46:14 I didn't even feel like I had to watch any of this shit. I was just like, yeah, there you go
01:46:17 I got the whole WrestleMania experience and it was way better than it would have been if I'd actually watched WrestleMania
01:46:23 So yeah, yeah, I had a really great time with that series
01:46:27 Sincerely hope it continues to be a yearly tradition from and you know
01:46:31 So do I and every basically every year
01:46:33 I think we missed one like two years ago
01:46:35 But the PCP boys will gather when Jesse sends us a link to watch the Royal Rumble and it's one of my favorite
01:46:40 We did it like a month or two ago and it's one of my favorite things to do. Yeah, you weren't there tragically
01:46:46 But I think me Jesse and Gib were all hanging out
01:46:49 Munchy to munchy, that's right. It was a great time. It's a great time
01:46:56 Yeah, wait, I've actually got I've got one
01:46:58 I want to know what hippo and Ben think are the the best thing that's out right now. Oh, yeah. Yeah, wait
01:47:04 I did I thought I said it was it's the rowdy fuckers juvenile detention
01:47:07 Well, hippo, what do you think is the best thing out. I mean, I like stuff. I
01:47:14 Don't love stuff though. I don't know whether I have like a like
01:47:18 Dude like it like if I was I had an older brother that I was gonna run and try and show him how cool
01:47:23 I am for knowing this well, I mean there's this I can't think of there's this one character
01:47:27 I really like that you might have heard about the Lord of Ghosts who's really being interesting to me online right now
01:47:32 I really like seeing what's going on with that guy really interesting
01:47:39 Yes, I honestly though like the stream you guys did of the ratty fuckers cop killer stuff like doing the lore contest and stuff
01:47:45 That was like I loved that. Yeah, I watched basically the whole thing and I the lore is rich and deep
01:47:52 And if you only you guys monetized it better, I would actually think it was a cool thing to spend your time on if only if only
01:47:59 I want to go the fuck do we do that?
01:48:00 I don't know before I find out it's $1 per slide before I even shut up about the the mania madness thing
01:48:07 I also have to mention that like since Jesse's come back. He always writes these
01:48:12 unbelievably long patreon posts for his videos that are literally a second video often with more context than the video that you
01:48:20 Watched so also those have been a great fun to read
01:48:23 It's like I just read them out loud to to May and that's like it's like I'm just getting another video out of it
01:48:30 Basically, well, that's cool dope. Oh wait. I have thing I have thing that I am in I'm doing currently
01:48:36 I asked for anime recommendations. Yeah, and she won it because I heard munchies say he wanted anime recommendations
01:48:42 I was like, you know what? I should get an anime recommend
01:48:44 I went to Twitter and did you said something you said Gundam?
01:48:48 I suggested Gundam goddamn it. That was me. No, he he said. Oh, I don't know
01:48:53 I said it first that people I know I told him to watch double 80 it's just because it was sure
01:48:58 Oh in the pocket and I've been watching it like one episode a day
01:49:01 Which is like a really good way to watch something like that and it feels like it's it's great
01:49:07 It's like a movie that's like gots. It's like a it's a good like action
01:49:12 Compared to like a BBC show just like a six episode tight compact drama, you know
01:49:17 Yeah, you're watching anime. It's it's it's it's an anime that does not feel like an anime. Oh, thank God
01:49:24 Thank God
01:49:26 Hippo, are you gonna try and become an anime boy too because that's what I'm well
01:49:29 I'm trying to become an anime boy, but I'm definitely trying to watch more anime. That's a definitely direction
01:49:33 We have to go back
01:49:35 I'm trying to be like like an anime boy before anime became anime
01:49:40 Yeah, like the 90s and the old all the old stuff. That's kind of like
01:49:45 Like a very very heavily influenced by actually good things
01:49:49 Like all the not the incestuous slurry of anime as it exists today, of course
01:49:53 Yeah, like if I see a picture of like a modern anime, I'm like, well that does just
01:49:59 I
01:50:02 Anybody who hasn't seen a Gundam double 80 war in the pocket by the way anime fans get out get on it
01:50:07 It's it's a it's a I consider it the best access point to Gundam simply because that's what I'm looking for
01:50:12 It's only six episodes
01:50:14 It's mostly standalone like there's a little bit of dialogue in the first episode that might go over your head if you don't know
01:50:19 The show but like the story but it doesn't matter. It's inconsequential to the it's yeah
01:50:24 I've been engrossed the characters are really well done in in terms of like having like quirks that I'm like
01:50:30 Ah, yeah, I could imagine him doing that as like as I just want to say human being my personal consultant
01:50:36 Ukrainian Zagok or however, it's pronounced. Yes, please at me on Twitter telling me if that assessment of this anime is correct
01:50:43 Cuz I trust you more than anyone when it comes to anime for some reason. Tell me if this stuff is good
01:50:50 He doesn't seem to have patrician taste this guy knows
01:50:55 This entirely on his avatar, I'm just gonna tell you that if somebody told me they thought Gundam double 80 was not good
01:51:01 I would not trust anything they said after that. Okay
01:51:08 We should have a podcast where we watch anime together that we want to know called the week of the plebe and the plebe
01:51:15 Yeah, let's actually do that
01:51:19 Hey, hey, listen to that me too. Yo, uh, here's an axle leader
01:51:25 That's a pretty good show pretty good show. That is 50 episodes long just let me know
01:51:29 Yeah, it is it is ooh, but stop after 25. I'll just watch all 50 at once
01:51:33 Also, the manga is better. So if you want to read the manga instead, there's also that option the ending
01:51:39 It looks really good. I'm like all anime which looks really bad
01:51:42 Basically, okay. Hey, there's a question here from
01:51:46 This is a Twitter question
01:51:48 Directors done looks just as good, but you know, we can get into that another day
01:51:52 Yeah, that's what I when you when you guys reach the stage where you want to get woke just come to me and I'll
01:51:59 I'll give you the dark side of the moon is what I'll give you
01:52:02 Digi literally what should happen is you should write like like it should be the plebe the plebe and the weeb
01:52:08 Yeah, me and hippo get into like an entry-level anime and then we're like this is not a bad idea
01:52:13 I like it and did you like
01:52:21 That actually happened recently like what I did like I can't get over that we brought that up last show, right?
01:52:27 I mean the Japs are real sympathetic to the fucking to the fucking croutes, you know, but whatever
01:52:34 Yeah, that should happen
01:52:36 Listen listen to this question here. This is from at at not you who three
01:52:43 It's weird. Okay. Here's the thing. Are you aware of the reach of your lectures?
01:52:48 I have presented two of them for my students to teach how to do lectures
01:52:54 Regardless of the subjects. Well, also that munchie one so spicy. That's a little common. Which one?
01:53:00 Um, well the new one of course the new one. I have a I have a I have a story
01:53:04 I got I'm retweeting. I'm replying to this guy right now asking which one so maybe he'll get back to us
01:53:09 I actually okay, so I have been
01:53:13 Recognized in public like relatively a lot recently like really yeah
01:53:18 I was hanging out with econ and
01:53:21 We went to this a magic we went to like a magic night and a guy there knew me
01:53:25 But that's not that surprising because he knew econ
01:53:28 Okay, but like he wasn't expecting to see me or anything
01:53:30 But then the other day we had a party me and Jackie had a party at our house and like a guy was just there
01:53:35 I might have even run into him before and he just at some point in the night asked me like hey
01:53:40 You're Ben, right? I was like yeah, I was like Ben St. And I and then he could see in my fucking
01:53:44 Sonichu lecture pulls out his little patreon subscription. I mean that's like a million fucking views right like yeah
01:53:50 Like half a million. Yeah, that's fucking nice. That's a lot of views. Every single day that I wake up
01:53:56 remembering that it would have been St. Patron it feels me with such glee
01:54:00 Such malicious glee and how I'm ruining the world for my fellow man. I love it
01:54:06 It fills it fills me with glee too, man. Also. I finished I finished signing the books. They're shipping probably
01:54:16 Yeah, but but in regards to this question people like
01:54:19 Disproportionately tell me how much they love I mean with when it comes to my content people say they love the gurren login videos
01:54:25 Like the galco video which was just like successful in terms of numbers
01:54:28 But then the the one that's even more discussed than that is the Kingdom Hearts lecture
01:54:33 Got a lot of buzz and people just are like, yeah, dude. That's like your best like it's incredible
01:54:37 The the lecture formula is such an overwhelming success
01:54:41 Yeah, and I got on the dick show again because I made a lecture, you know, I'm right
01:54:45 I mean if I hadn't even ever been on there before I probably could have got not like I I knew as soon as I made it
01:54:52 That I was like this will get me on that show like
01:54:58 And I by the way, it was my idea just throwing that out. Yeah, that's true
01:55:03 That passion and raw like like knowledge. Yeah, and you're like otherworldly like like if you have a lot if you're doing a lecture
01:55:10 That's something you care deeply about and you have a lot to say. Yeah, so it's you just dumping your best shit in the entire world
01:55:17 Which is why does anybody want to hype like any lectures?
01:55:21 They have planned because like we've never announced any I think before like way ahead of time
01:55:26 That's like the guilty gear one
01:55:27 But I think the guilty gear one got like hype by being mentioned beforehand and I that one did for sure
01:55:33 I'm gonna go ahead and say this mine because I want to encourage everybody to go listen to this music in the meantime
01:55:39 So that it'll be extra rewarding when I explain it
01:55:41 I want to do a lecture on the entire lore of the first five Coheed and Cambria albums
01:55:46 So that's a good one if you want to go listen to Coheed and get into their music and maybe learn a little bit about the lore
01:55:53 Before I fucking open it up and make you realize how fucking insane it is
01:55:57 Yeah, there you go
01:55:59 Well, I I mean I still want to hype I want to hype tails gets trolled. That's coming out real soon. Oh, yeah
01:56:04 It's almost done. It's almost but the time you hear this. Maybe it'll be out
01:56:07 It might be out by the time this is out. Maybe mm-hmm
01:56:11 Other than that, I don't know what else I want to do like lecture
01:56:14 I really wanted to do a lecture on the Digi clips
01:56:17 But when I went to go and like look up the that's the thing where where the people thought that the Digimon world was becoming real
01:56:23 Right, but when I went and I looked into it
01:56:26 Could not like find
01:56:28 Like I just could not find like the info that I remembered reading about it before so I couldn't confirm any of the stuff
01:56:35 I remembered about it, you know, I bet you should you should spend some deep dive time
01:56:38 Try to see if you can pull that up because hey anything that means like you've told me much about that like it's
01:56:44 I remember so much, but like when I went to go find it. I was like, where did it all go?
01:56:49 There was so much there was it's it's got it might be somewhere it might be buried in like a something awful thread somewhere is my best guess
01:56:57 I just hope it still exists like I pray. Yeah
01:57:02 And if you can if you can capture it in lecture form it'll exist for all time so that would be great just for historical
01:57:09 For me to do would be home stuck and I do do that, but I feel like yawn
01:57:15 Chief was already there. I don't need you that but I just came with us just now
01:57:19 Hmm. I like like what I like to do about lectures is stuff that is like influenced me and like you know
01:57:24 Wasn't my childhood and that like stuck with me and like it like made me feel a certain way or yeah
01:57:28 I'm part of my mythos human history lecture until nation. Obviously, so what I could do is like an explain
01:57:34 Like tf2 because you have to like like not like the yeah
01:57:39 Like like like the meta lore of tf2 it's descent into fucking retardation
01:57:44 And how was the greatest game of all time? That's uh, maybe that's a pretty good idea
01:57:51 It's interesting because I because I have like almost like three thousand hours. Are there like human characters you can mention in this
01:57:57 Okay, good. Yeah, yeah, gay banool
01:58:00 Yo, I actually I have literally already put together a list of future lecture ideas with with various degrees of
01:58:08 Their viability and how much research needs to be done for each one
01:58:11 I I'm not gonna share any specific ones right now because I really like to keep things secret before I release them
01:58:17 But what I will say is that people have put a lot of suggestions in like the Kingdom Hearts and the like the new final fantasy one
01:58:23 Which is doing very well. Thanks. Everybody go watch that
01:58:26 And and I'll just say that I have been taking note of the suggestions Metal Gear Solid
01:58:32 That that that's one that has been suggested that is true
01:58:36 That was that was just a guess that actually yeah, that wouldn't people suggest that went a bunch
01:58:42 Historically, but yep, you know, just just more will come in the future at some point everybody. So stay tuned for the radcon four. I
01:58:50 Want to try one radcon four literally with literally no
01:58:56 I want I want to try one
01:58:58 But the the things I have are like massive undertakings
01:59:01 Yeah, one of them is like an entire medium and I'm not sure whether I should follow an artist in the medium or like describe the
01:59:07 Oh shit, what about like here's just a thought like the history of the ps1 just like start to finish
01:59:12 Well, I don't know that that much. Oh, okay. That's just like I wrote over the ps2. I mean sure
01:59:17 It's just I don't know like I don't know what to do
01:59:21 You got to take some time and really think about like I think like for me the most fun is when it's something that's like
01:59:26 That no one else would have thought about it all like yeah
01:59:30 All the lectures have kind of been like like you wouldn't even imagine somebody would do this except for maybe
01:59:36 Well, even something like a final
01:59:38 Fancy would have made a no writer video about then it's not interesting. I mean that's definitely true
01:59:43 But like what makes in my mind the final fantasy and the Kingdom Hearts lectures so
01:59:48 Like like actually good is the fact that like very few people actually know all the details and all these learning about final fantasy, too
01:59:56 Hey, I don't know if you know this but like literally
02:00:00 Right after radcon may and I played through I played the final fantasy 10 and she played the final fantasy 2
02:00:06 And she really I know yeah, just she played through to just on the basis of me
02:00:11 Describing to her what you had described to me that night
02:00:15 Yeah
02:00:17 Emperor and she beat the whole game. I beat 10 finally the first final fantasy game
02:00:21 I ever fucking beat I want to write a whole book about it. There's a lot
02:00:25 Congratulations. Oh dude. I actually the first here's just a little tip it the first serious con panel
