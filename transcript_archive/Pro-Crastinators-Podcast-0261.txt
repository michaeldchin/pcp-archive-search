00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.
00:00:19 Hi, I guess. Welcome to, I guess, The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I guess this is like another episode or something.
00:00:33 Surely not.
00:00:34 Whatever. No, yeah. Yeah, it's episode 200 in...
00:00:39 The word on the street is that this is the show.
00:00:46 Yeah, that's what I heard. I didn't buy it.
00:00:52 I know, I know. It's terrible. Funny gimmick. No, that's it. That's it. That's the episode. This is really the product you've chosen to listen to.
00:01:06 You've arrived here in 2021 listening to this. I'm so sorry.
00:01:14 You know, I was looking at the thumbnail for the last episode, and it's got two Nostalgia Critic faces and then our logo.
00:01:22 I kind of help but wonder because it's like the titles like Nostalgia Critic and Medical Fraud, PCP.
00:01:29 I just have to wonder if somebody comes across that not knowing what we are. What on earth are they going to be thinking?
00:01:37 I don't like that the title is Nostalgia Critic and Medical Fraud, and there are two images, but they are both Nostalgia Critic.
00:01:45 It's not like we spent the entire episode talking about the Nostalgia Critic.
00:01:50 It was just the beginning. Yeah, I don't know. Eleazar does all those, so send your hate mail to Eleazar.
00:01:57 Send your hate mail to Eleazar. He deserves every bit of it.
00:02:03 Yeah, so what's up gamers?
00:02:09 Well, let's start. Speaking of gamers then, Ben, you have released the Alpha Build of your game. Do you want to talk about it?
00:02:18 Yeah, I'll talk about it a little bit. My secret project that I've been teasing and teasing for months, I announced what it is, and I posted the Alpha Build of it.
00:02:28 I think a lot of people guessed that it was a game. I tried not to give it away, but some people...
00:02:33 I think that the way I talked about it, the fact that I talked about adding stuff and including stuff, I think might have given it away for some people.
00:02:43 That it's a game. I just assumed it was a game based on the fact that if it was just another comic chapter, it wouldn't be, I don't know.
00:02:52 It'd be like, yeah, you already do that.
00:02:55 Oh, I would just say I was doing it. Yeah, I feel like.
00:03:00 Maybe, maybe. Yeah, it is the Slime and Punishment, the true finale.
00:03:07 I made the video last year that was so long ago, S-Rivert, which was like this...
00:03:15 It was sort of the climax, sort of the, what's the word, the S-Cascade, but that wasn't the end.
00:03:22 But Phantom's Revenge is what I'm calling the game, and it will actually be the end of...
00:03:29 Well, it'll be basically the end. There'll be a little bit of comic that comes before it and after it to kind of go with it, but the game is it.
00:03:38 So I put out the Alpha build, which is like, it's not done. It doesn't have any of the story in it.
00:03:46 It's basically just as dummy backgrounds, dummy enemies, but it's playable, and you can play it and beat it.
00:03:54 It's like, I might tweak it a bit, but it's mechanically complete, so it's a playable.
00:04:01 And that's on my Patreon for $5 patrons to play-test it for me.
00:04:06 And having a bunch of people have played it, and I think the number is five people who have actually beaten it, because I made it really hard.
00:04:20 And I think it's... I made it really hard, expecting that people would probably surprise me, and there would probably be ways to beat it that I didn't consider.
00:04:33 No. No. No, it's just really, really hard, and you really have to...
00:04:42 Beating it requires that you have a lot of patience and try it many, many times.
00:04:50 Maybe like a dozen or 20 times, somewhere in that range, and that you just very carefully exhaust...
00:05:01 You think of what could I do differently, and then you exhaust many, many different possibilities trying it until you find the right way to do it.
00:05:10 That's a little... I guess that's a bit of a hint on how to beat it.
00:05:14 Yeah, I don't know. Do you mind? Well, I guess since it's a patron-only game right now, we shouldn't probably talk about all the stuff in it, but I just want to say...
00:05:23 I don't really mind if you talk... I don't mind if you... There's not much to spoil in it, really.
00:05:29 Well, I wouldn't say don't spoil... And this goes for anyone who's maybe a patron of mine talking to other people about it.
00:05:37 I would say don't spoil how to beat it, because there are sort of little things you can think of, and you go, oh, I could try this or something.
00:05:45 Yeah, I can't do that, because I haven't beaten it, because I thought it was too hard.
00:05:50 Wait, I want to shout out everyone who's beaten it, because the list is so short.
00:05:59 Hold on. I'm going to look at my patron channel and search images, because when you beat the game, it shows an image that gives you stats to what...
00:06:12 It shows you some data about how you beat it and what your numbers were at, and this was just for me to obtain information.
00:06:20 But because it is so... The ways it can be beaten are so limited, they're all exactly the same.
00:06:27 Yeah, I figured.
00:06:29 Yeah, it has an image, let's see.
00:06:34 So the people who have beaten it are Munchy, Sean, Sean Don, Sean Garrett, that guy, Shinisaba, Taiyo, and Crack.
00:06:48 Crack was the first to beat it. He currently holds the speedrun world record at 5 minutes and 57 seconds.
00:06:55 Beat that.
00:06:57 Speedrun?
00:06:58 Like as in like from the first... like booting up for the first time, just beat it in 5 minutes, or did he...?
00:07:05 I don't know if he timed it from... wait a minute.
00:07:11 That seems impossible to figure it out so quickly and to do it perfectly.
00:07:16 Well no, not from booting it up and never having played it. I assume it's probably from hitting start.
00:07:25 Or maybe it's from hitting restart?
00:07:30 Because it plays slightly differently if you start from the main menu versus if you do restart in the pause menu.
00:07:37 So... I'm not sure which one.
00:07:43 But I can find out. I can find out.
00:07:46 Because he has an unlisted video.
00:07:49 Okay, it is timed from... I can find it out.
00:07:54 Yes, it is timed from hitting start on the main menu.
00:07:59 Not a restart, because that would be cheating.
00:08:02 Because you gotta wait through the opening quote screen that sets the mood.
00:08:10 Yeah.
00:08:11 I had... I'm gonna say I had fun with it. It was a good game and it was very cute.
00:08:17 Little phantom horn with a sword. His little sprite.
00:08:21 His name... there's a bit of lore. His sword's name is Platinum.
00:08:29 And I want to include something in the game that will let you...
00:08:34 No, it's named Platinum because it's after Princess Platinum, the founder of the Kingdom of Unicornia.
00:08:43 Actually, yeah, that's the lore there.
00:08:46 I think I'm gonna put in a slime command that will basically be like a look command
00:08:54 that will let you sort of scan your enemies and yourself and get a description.
00:09:00 If you read Phantom's description, it will give you...
00:09:03 As if you've done a slime or a look command in Endless War on a character
00:09:10 and it gives you the characters' readout and what they're wearing and stuff.
00:09:14 So I think I'll do that maybe and it'll explain like...
00:09:17 He is wielding Platinum, a katana.
00:09:20 He is a level whatever sword master and so on and so on.
00:09:26 So that'll be fun.
00:09:28 I think we need to add to it before it's done.
00:09:30 The basics of it are... it's like some sort of a fighting RPG turn-based thing.
00:09:40 Phantom horn, a little sprite.
00:09:42 And there's enemies that are at the moment just orbs, like Unicorn Jelly orbs.
00:09:47 I'd assume they're like actual enemies.
00:09:49 No, those are just plate...
00:09:51 Yeah, you just fight colored orbs that are just placeholders.
00:09:56 Those are not the real enemies that are actually going to be in the game when it's done.
00:10:00 Yeah, and it's got like a little text thing with like a...
00:10:04 Your voice going...
00:10:06 Yeah.
00:10:08 You can tell it was my voice.
00:10:11 Oh, completely. It's so obvious.
00:10:14 That's so funny.
00:10:16 Well, I mean, Canonically Phantom's voice is my voice, so I mean...
00:10:20 Yeah.
00:10:23 Okay.
00:10:25 I feel self-indulgent in talking about it, but I'll discuss it a little bit.
00:10:30 He has lines that he like shouts in battle.
00:10:33 I voiced all those, but then for like his text box, yeah, he has the little sands.
00:10:39 But I just made a little sound.
00:10:42 I recorded myself going...
00:10:44 And I just made that little bit-bit-bit-bit-bit sound.
00:10:49 He...
00:10:51 I was...
00:10:52 My favorite part of it, and the part that I think is so funny, and I was like,
00:10:56 I have to make this game with this idea in mind, is...
00:11:00 When he attacks, he yells the...
00:11:04 He yells the...
00:11:06 Like in Kendo.
00:11:08 Just like...
00:11:10 Months and months ago, before I started working on it, I would think about it,
00:11:14 and I'd be like, it would just be so funny.
00:11:17 They have Phantom Horn doing that.
00:11:20 And you know what, I would...
00:11:21 Has he ever expressed interest in Kendo before that, or is it just sort of a...
00:11:25 Well, in...
00:11:27 I mean, in Slime and Punishment, he learns to fight, and he fights with a katana.
00:11:31 So...
00:11:33 Only in that...
00:11:34 I mean, and you know, it's implied that he is trained with a katana in the dojo.
00:11:39 But I just decided like, you know, I used to do kumdo,
00:11:43 and I feel like Phantom Horn is me in a lot of ways.
00:11:47 And so I'll just migrate that element of myself into him.
00:11:51 And I think it makes sense that he would be very like...
00:11:54 He would be very by the book.
00:11:56 Like he would have like bought like a book about like Kendo forms,
00:11:59 and like practice them, and like, you know, he would...
00:12:02 He would say the lines at the appropriate time, like you do in the sport.
00:12:08 Just seems appropriate. Just seems like what he would do.
00:12:12 Yeah.
00:12:16 I was making more sprites.
00:12:19 Yeah, I've been making more sprites since the Alpha launch,
00:12:24 because there's a bunch of things that I kind of just put placeholder animations in
00:12:28 that I want them to look better.
00:12:30 Like when he drinks the fuck energy in the Alpha build now,
00:12:35 there's just one frame of him like holding a can to his mouth.
00:12:38 I would really like to add them.
00:12:40 So like, there's two frames where he's kind of like...
00:12:43 The can is sort of like moving as he kind of like chugs it like...
00:12:47 And then I think I would like to like have him like either like crush it on his forehead
00:12:51 or like slam it on the ground afterwards or something.
00:12:54 I just think it would look cool.
00:12:56 I was adding things like that in.
00:12:59 That's what my mind's at.
00:13:01 The sprite work is really nice.
00:13:04 You know, it's like he's got a little phantom horn with his sword
00:13:10 and he's got this...
00:13:12 Every time he does the sword slashes, when he says the words,
00:13:15 he does a different pose. I think he mentioned that to me.
00:13:18 I was like, oh yes, kendo moves.
00:13:20 When he does...
00:13:22 He does like a side slash across the abdomen
00:13:25 and when he does men, it holds the sword up high
00:13:29 and then when he does kote, it's kind of like middle forward.
00:13:32 He slides forward.
00:13:34 He knows his kata.
00:13:38 He knows his forms.
00:13:40 He's trained.
00:13:42 He's trained in the art of the blade.
00:13:44 While you were having sex, he was studying the blade.
00:13:48 While you were partying.
00:13:50 It worked out for him, I guess.
00:13:52 For the people who could beat the game.
00:13:55 Yeah.
00:13:57 He's got to take his revenge and this is the only way.
00:14:01 This is the only way he can do it.
00:14:10 It's really hard.
00:14:12 I think I will make it...
00:14:14 I like that it is hard.
00:14:16 I think maybe it's a little overboard right now
00:14:19 and I will probably think of ways to maybe relax the difficulty
00:14:23 a bit before the final version.
00:14:25 A little bit.
00:14:27 I still want it to be hard
00:14:29 and I still want you to have to play through it multiple times
00:14:31 and consider like,
00:14:33 what could I do differently that would make me survive?
00:14:37 That's good.
00:14:39 Also, a bunch of people told me...
00:14:41 I'm not going to say what,
00:14:43 but there are things in the game
00:14:45 that a bunch of people tried to play through multiple times
00:14:48 without even finding or noticing
00:14:50 and then when they stopped and were like,
00:14:52 shit, I keep losing,
00:14:54 they went a little bit into the options
00:14:58 and were like, oh, that's there?
00:15:00 Oh, wow. Neat.
00:15:02 Oh, I didn't go into the options menu.
00:15:04 No, no, no, not like the options menu.
00:15:06 I mean, like looking at your...
00:15:08 looking at like the stuff you have.
00:15:10 Oh, right, yeah.
00:15:12 I want to talk about my experiences with it
00:15:14 because like...
00:15:16 RPGs...
00:15:18 Don't spoil, don't spoil.
00:15:20 I won't spoil like what I figured out, but I...
00:15:24 Like the game you go in
00:15:26 and you have to attack
00:15:28 and in RFCK rules,
00:15:30 you spend slime to attack
00:15:32 and slime is also your health.
00:15:34 So you're like dealing damage
00:15:36 to these enemies
00:15:38 and then they're dealing damage to you
00:15:40 and your slime is going down,
00:15:42 you have podrons and you can munch on them
00:15:44 to get some slime back
00:15:46 and you know,
00:15:48 if you don't use your items,
00:15:50 you have a bunch of items you start with,
00:15:52 like a fucking energy drink
00:15:54 for getting your hunger back,
00:15:56 which also depletes when you attack
00:15:58 and you have to use these items properly
00:16:00 and if you use them incorrectly
00:16:02 and as far as I can understand,
00:16:04 if you do a single thing
00:16:06 in any of the turns wrong,
00:16:10 you will fuck yourself for the later battles
00:16:12 where you will either run out of slime
00:16:14 and be unable to attack
00:16:16 or you'll just die.
00:16:18 There is basically zero margin for error
00:16:20 the way it is right now.
00:16:22 It reminds me a little bit
00:16:24 of Robo-Dobot's
00:16:26 Minecraft
00:16:28 car
00:16:30 map.
00:16:32 Remember that?
00:16:34 God, yeah.
00:16:36 Oh, God.
00:16:38 You have to do it completely.
00:16:40 I mean, that one was a little different
00:16:42 because Minecraft has physics
00:16:44 and there's so many different ways you could do
00:16:46 the drive.
00:16:48 Yeah.
00:16:50 It's not painful.
00:16:52 At least it was memorable.
00:16:54 This is the sort of game that I would hate
00:16:56 in every way because it's
00:16:58 trial and error. I know.
00:17:00 It's anti-gib and it's design.
00:17:02 A lot of number munching.
00:17:04 I feel like if I wanted to
00:17:06 truly understand
00:17:08 how to beat it, I would need to
00:17:10 pay attention to when the enemies come in,
00:17:12 how much damage they deal
00:17:14 and then write a spreadsheet of,
00:17:16 okay, I have this much here,
00:17:18 I have this much slime here.
00:17:20 I'm able to get to this point.
00:17:22 Oh, but then something will go wrong.
00:17:24 I'd need to do a lot of
00:17:26 sitting down and writing stuff down.
00:17:28 That's not what I like.
00:17:30 But I did enjoy the process
00:17:32 of learning
00:17:34 because
00:17:36 in a lot of RPGs, you have all these things.
00:17:38 You never use them.
00:17:40 How many times do you actually use
00:17:42 fucking X attack in Pokémon?
00:17:44 There's so many items
00:17:46 that are completely useless. You just attack.
00:17:48 With a strong attack and you win.
00:17:50 And in this, every
00:17:52 single part of the game is
00:17:54 integral to understand and to be used
00:17:56 to its fullest extents
00:17:58 in order to win. You will be used
00:18:00 to fullest extents. Yes, you will.
00:18:02 I think the quote is,
00:18:04 I will you use to fullest
00:18:06 extents.
00:18:08 I thought it was you will be used
00:18:10 to fullest extents. That's why I found it so funny.
00:18:12 It was because it didn't make
00:18:14 any grammatical sense at all.
00:18:16 I will you used
00:18:18 to fullest extents. Wait, you there?
00:18:20 Shit. Oh god,
00:18:22 my headphones died. Oh.
00:18:24 Give me a sec.
00:18:28 Classic bin.
00:18:32 How many times has
00:18:34 the headphone thing been a problem?
00:18:36 Oh my god, no. How many thousands
00:18:38 of times? I'm sorry.
00:18:40 Eleazar, cut this. No, don't cut it.
00:18:44 People need to know about
00:18:46 the headphones.
00:18:48 How could this
00:18:50 happen to me?
00:18:52 Hey, you there?
00:18:54 Hey, you there?
00:18:56 Okay.
00:18:58 Hey, I hear you. Okay, cool.
00:19:00 Hey, cool.
00:19:02 Okay, yes, fullest extents.
00:19:04 I'm back.
00:19:08 Oh, I wanted to say
00:19:10 about it that like
00:19:12 in terms of the difficulty,
00:19:14 I, yeah, it's very exacting
00:19:16 but the way
00:19:18 it's a menu based, turn based
00:19:20 RPG style battle.
00:19:22 So like you only have limited options.
00:19:24 And so
00:19:26 I want to
00:19:28 when you're playing through it and trying to figure out
00:19:30 how to win, I think you go through a process
00:19:32 where you at first you kind of have to
00:19:34 come to grips with like, okay,
00:19:36 what options do I have
00:19:38 available?
00:19:40 And then you kind of are like, okay, here's the things
00:19:42 I can do. And then, hmm,
00:19:44 so how can I best employ
00:19:46 these things against, you know,
00:19:48 the configurations of enemies
00:19:50 that I'm going against? And then eventually
00:19:52 you figure out like, oh, okay, if I use this
00:19:54 at such and such a time,
00:19:56 then I can get through this section without taking damage.
00:19:58 Yeah.
00:20:00 Genuinely, like a cool, like
00:20:02 unique thing that I hadn't really seen
00:20:04 in a game. I feel like it's,
00:20:06 it's like, you know, being thrown into
00:20:08 a nuzlocke, except I hate those.
00:20:10 But like,
00:20:12 you need to know your shit
00:20:14 and that when there's only
00:20:16 a small amount of shit to know,
00:20:18 like the items you have, the turns
00:20:20 that it takes, the health you have
00:20:22 and the damage the enemy does, once you know
00:20:24 all of the variables, and there aren't that many
00:20:26 variables to memorize, it feels like
00:20:28 it's doable. So it's not annoying
00:20:30 in ways that it would otherwise be
00:20:32 if it was like part of a larger RPG.
00:20:34 When you're, when you're
00:20:36 like learning it, I think there's that
00:20:38 first phase where you're
00:20:40 figuring out what your options are
00:20:42 and how they should be used.
00:20:44 And then once you get that
00:20:46 down, then there's like, you're not
00:20:48 quite done yet, because then there's like,
00:20:50 okay, now I understand
00:20:52 how to use this stuff, but
00:20:54 now it's a matter of like
00:20:56 trying over and over again
00:20:58 or trying a bunch of times
00:21:00 to like, use them in different
00:21:02 ways and just kind of experiment with it
00:21:04 until you find that perfect exact
00:21:06 combination of like moves
00:21:08 that results in victory.
00:21:10 And I think that like the first part
00:21:12 is good difficulty
00:21:14 and the second part is like not as fun
00:21:16 difficulty. So I would kind of like
00:21:18 to maybe increase that first
00:21:20 part
00:21:22 of like the understanding, the complexity
00:21:24 and then decrease
00:21:26 the second part so that like
00:21:28 once you get, okay, these are
00:21:30 my options and these are how to use them,
00:21:32 then that's basically
00:21:34 when you win.
00:21:36 Yeah, because I got to a point
00:21:38 with less sort of
00:21:40 trial and error of like,
00:21:42 okay, did this work? No, did this work?
00:21:44 No, did this work? No, did this work? No.
00:21:46 Okay, that finally got it.
00:21:48 Yeah, that's where I was getting
00:21:50 is like, I got pretty
00:21:52 far. I learned a lot
00:21:54 about the ways to get to a certain
00:21:56 point in the game.
00:21:58 But then I was running up against a wall of like,
00:22:00 I'm not sure on which
00:22:02 turn I made a mistake, but I did
00:22:04 something wrong and I can't
00:22:06 figure out what it could have been
00:22:08 and now I
00:22:10 realize that the next like 40
00:22:12 minutes to an hour is just going to be me
00:22:14 getting to this point again
00:22:16 and then trying one
00:22:18 thing differently and then losing
00:22:20 again and being like, what, what is it?
00:22:22 And I'd be hitting my head against the wall
00:22:24 and that's the trial and error and I
00:22:26 couldn't, I couldn't bear
00:22:28 the idea so I stopped.
00:22:30 Without spoiling too much, I will
00:22:32 tell you that
00:22:34 I know how far you got
00:22:36 you got most of the way through
00:22:38 but there was a little more
00:22:40 and the bit more that there was
00:22:42 that you didn't see yet
00:22:44 I know that you
00:22:46 would have gotten there
00:22:48 and been like, oh, okay
00:22:50 I understand
00:22:52 what I have to do and
00:22:54 you would have been wrong
00:22:56 there would have been even more
00:22:58 and it would have driven you fucking crazy
00:23:00 Yeah
00:23:04 Yeah, it just didn't add up
00:23:06 there's not enough
00:23:08 numbers to, you can't
00:23:10 put them together to create victory
00:23:12 it doesn't make any sense, do I have to click
00:23:14 on a pixel or do I get a secret?
00:23:16 You just can't do it
00:23:18 Yeah, so
00:23:20 I feel like
00:23:22 so I feel like
00:23:24 Mission accomplished
00:23:26 Well, part of me feels like
00:23:28 part of me feels like, okay, I should have
00:23:30 just known
00:23:32 the short
00:23:34 strengths and shortcomings
00:23:36 of how I balanced it
00:23:38 already
00:23:40 but I feel like having had
00:23:42 some people test it out
00:23:44 and get their feedback really confirmed
00:23:46 it confirmed
00:23:48 what I feel like I should have already known
00:23:50 but that I didn't really have that much confidence in
00:23:52 which is like
00:23:54 yeah, that
00:23:56 difficulty curve
00:23:58 information that I just mentioned
00:24:00 It's, I mean it's
00:24:02 playtesting tells you a lot
00:24:04 because you're building it, it's like
00:24:06 it's like when
00:24:08 like an editor
00:24:10 sometimes edits like a video
00:24:12 and they do that thing where they
00:24:14 put the
00:24:16 like an image on every
00:24:18 like word being said
00:24:20 such that it, when it's
00:24:22 played back, it doesn't make any sense
00:24:24 and you can't follow along because the images are too short
00:24:26 and it's really annoying and terrible
00:24:28 and it would be so much better
00:24:30 as a viewing experience if it was
00:24:32 just like a simple image
00:24:34 to go along with the audio
00:24:36 and
00:24:38 from the editor's point of view
00:24:40 nothing is wrong, it totally makes sense
00:24:42 each word is lined up to an image
00:24:44 and through
00:24:46 you know
00:24:48 a viewer's perspective
00:24:50 it feels different, so like you're making the game
00:24:52 you don't know
00:24:54 the learning curve from the perspective of someone
00:24:56 who doesn't know what is in the game
00:24:58 so it's like, it's completely
00:25:00 you need to do playtesting
00:25:02 and those things to figure out what
00:25:04 you're missing because it's always something
00:25:06 yeah, because I
00:25:08 I like had to
00:25:10 figure out the game in reverse
00:25:12 because like
00:25:14 I sort of like
00:25:16 I was like playtesting it
00:25:18 and like this was, I didn't
00:25:20 hadn't decided like any like
00:25:22 numbers at all
00:25:24 and so I had to like kind of
00:25:26 I sort of had to like
00:25:28 assume like the optimal way to play
00:25:30 and then like play it through
00:25:32 like that and then
00:25:34 I put in like
00:25:36 counters to count like
00:25:38 how many attacks do you have to do
00:25:40 how many turns does it take
00:25:42 how many times do you
00:25:44 take this damage from this enemy
00:25:46 how many times do you take damage from that enemy
00:25:48 and I built those in so that I could
00:25:50 look at it and then sort of
00:25:52 tally up the numbers and then be like
00:25:54 okay so if I set your starting slime
00:25:56 to this amount
00:25:58 that gives you just enough if you
00:26:00 if you are
00:26:02 if you play correctly
00:26:04 and then I was nervous though
00:26:06 and the reason why there's so little margin
00:26:08 for error is because if
00:26:10 I wanted to give a little bit of leeway
00:26:12 but if I gave too much leeway
00:26:14 then that would allow
00:26:16 for sub
00:26:18 a wide enough margin
00:26:20 would allow for sub optimal
00:26:22 play to the extent
00:26:24 that you might be able to win without
00:26:26 understanding the like
00:26:28 the like what is the right
00:26:30 what is the right play
00:26:32 and what is the wrong play
00:26:34 which I would consider a failure
00:26:36 like yeah if you
00:26:38 just if you didn't
00:26:40 understand why
00:26:42 you shouldn't
00:26:44 I don't know waste certain resources
00:26:46 at certain times and but you did it
00:26:48 anyway and you won anyway I would be like well my game
00:26:50 failed you didn't learn what you were
00:26:52 supposed to learn
00:26:54 yeah which is why I controlled
00:26:56 it so tightly
00:26:58 it's interesting and I like
00:27:00 if we get into the philosophy of that
00:27:02 because a game
00:27:04 is an interactive experience
00:27:06 but if it's exactly the same
00:27:08 I mean obviously
00:27:10 there's still interactivity because you can
00:27:12 fail and you can do it wrong
00:27:14 but once you know how to do it right
00:27:16 you're doing it exactly
00:27:18 as the author intended
00:27:20 as opposed to most games
00:27:22 where you don't necessarily have to do it exactly
00:27:24 that way there's like
00:27:26 yeah
00:27:28 you know
00:27:30 well it's like
00:27:32 I guess it's like a
00:27:34 mystery when you
00:27:36 when you read a mystery
00:27:38 you know you have the
00:27:40 tension of the story and then you have the
00:27:42 when the mystery is revealed you have the catharsis
00:27:44 of the aha moment
00:27:46 so I guess in a roundabout way
00:27:48 what I was going for
00:27:50 was not so much that like
00:27:52 was not so much that like
00:27:54 oh you can
00:27:56 interact with this game
00:27:58 this is a creative experience
00:28:00 that you participate in playing
00:28:02 but I guess it was
00:28:04 I was seeking after that
00:28:06 that moment of revelation where you're like
00:28:08 oh I understand
00:28:10 and it so
00:28:12 and I mean based on
00:28:14 what people said
00:28:16 who played it they did have those moments
00:28:18 where they were like you know first they were like
00:28:20 oh I see what I have to do
00:28:22 and they try and they're like what
00:28:24 it still didn't work what am I missing
00:28:26 what am I missing and they're like oh
00:28:28 there's that works okay I get it
00:28:30 so like you know
00:28:32 I guess mission accomplished
00:28:34 in that regard
00:28:36 I think it's good as much as I sound like
00:28:38 I'm like salty or whatever
00:28:40 I am
00:28:42 a little bit because I wanted to see
00:28:44 what would happen
00:28:46 but I just got too tired
00:28:48 maybe I'll try it again soon
00:28:50 as much as I sound salty
00:28:52 it is a good
00:28:54 well crafted experience
00:28:56 like I enjoyed the detective
00:28:58 the detective stuff involved
00:29:00 hmm
00:29:02 it's not complete it doesn't have
00:29:04 a real ending but I did throw in
00:29:06 a funny little
00:29:08 something
00:29:10 when you win
00:29:12 just a funny little goof
00:29:14 it's not much
00:29:16 but it's something
00:29:18 for anyone who has
00:29:20 the courage to see it through
00:29:24 did you ever
00:29:26 play
00:29:28 and more importantly beat getting over it
00:29:30 with Bennett Fuddy
00:29:34 I played a bunch of it
00:29:36 and I got pretty far
00:29:38 and I was committed
00:29:40 to beating it because like
00:29:42 I am
00:29:44 I'm no offense
00:29:46 but I am the opposite of you
00:29:48 I am a very patient gamer
00:29:50 and I am very
00:29:52 driven
00:29:54 I'm very much like
00:29:56 I don't get bored
00:29:58 I do get frustrated but it doesn't stop me
00:30:00 I just am like
00:30:02 however long it takes
00:30:04 I will beat this fucking thing
00:30:06 I'm very like
00:30:08 that's not a good thing or a bad thing
00:30:10 it's just
00:30:12 I'm very easily hooked
00:30:14 I'm very easily hooked
00:30:16 by something that is like
00:30:18 you can't fucking beat this
00:30:20 and I'm like yes I fucking can
00:30:22 so I really wanted to beat Bennett Fuddy
00:30:24 but at some point I kind of fell off
00:30:26 trying and I never got around
00:30:28 to actually beating it much to my
00:30:30 shame so
00:30:32 I played a bunch but I never actually beat it
00:30:34 I did spoil myself
00:30:36 and go and look up and see
00:30:38 people beating it even though they're not supposed to
00:30:40 they're not supposed to show it but somebody did
00:30:46 I did it with like the
00:30:48 cause like seeing the ending is not really
00:30:50 the point is the
00:30:52 the point is having gotten to the ending
00:30:54 and feeling accomplished in doing so yeah
00:30:56 I did it with the understanding
00:30:58 that like one day I will go back and I will beat it
00:31:00 I will attain the technical mastery
00:31:02 but
00:31:04 it's 2021 and I still haven't
00:31:06 so shame on me I guess
00:31:08 I think the thing with that game is that
00:31:10 it's more
00:31:12 than your
00:31:14 game would ever be because of the fact
00:31:16 that it's like physics based and you can
00:31:18 you know
00:31:20 the movements of the mouse
00:31:22 are so
00:31:24 numerous in the way they could
00:31:26 happen that it's like
00:31:28 impossible to have
00:31:30 unless you're a robot
00:31:32 a perfect path that always works
00:31:34 without any other problems
00:31:36 the like the
00:31:38 like the possible
00:31:40 I mean you know
00:31:42 in my game every turn
00:31:44 you could give one of a number of different inputs
00:31:46 so like the number of possible
00:31:48 the number of possible inputs
00:31:50 is like
00:31:52 I don't know how many turns it takes maybe like
00:31:54 30
00:31:56 turns or something and each time there's
00:31:58 3
00:32:00 or 4 possible inputs so
00:32:02 that's like 3 to the power of
00:32:04 30 to the power of 4 which is probably
00:32:06 like you know
00:32:08 something like 10 to the
00:32:10 10 to the 35th you know some huge number
00:32:12 but like in
00:32:14 the body it's like every moment
00:32:16 you know your mouse can be
00:32:18 have a different position and it can have a different
00:32:20 velocity and so like
00:32:22 every moment the possible
00:32:24 the possibilities are like multiplying infinitely
00:32:26 and so like it's like
00:32:28 it's like fucking
00:32:30 instead of like aleph null it's like aleph
00:32:32 3 or whatever it's like
00:32:34 it's like
00:32:36 it's like
00:32:38 uncountably infinite
00:32:40 instead of like countable infinite
00:32:42 if that makes any sense
00:32:44 I guess it's also like
00:32:46 not a strategic thing
00:32:48 it's because
00:32:50 necessarily like knowing
00:32:52 the right thing to do
00:32:54 is not so much as important
00:32:56 as being able to have the
00:32:58 reflexes to do it or the muscle
00:33:00 memory to move your mouse in that way
00:33:02 yeah there's reflexes
00:33:04 and there's muscle memory but there's also like
00:33:08 I mean you do have to
00:33:10 there are like techniques to learn
00:33:12 like getting up the
00:33:14 the chimney
00:33:16 do you know the chimney part where you have to go up
00:33:18 the really narrow like
00:33:20 vertical tunnel
00:33:22 yeah like getting up that
00:33:24 I mean you can kind of like
00:33:26 fudge your way through it sometimes
00:33:28 but
00:33:30 after you try it a bunch
00:33:32 you figure out that there is like
00:33:34 there are consistent strategies
00:33:36 there are consistent like techniques
00:33:38 that will consistently get you up it
00:33:40 like cooking your hammer on the lights
00:33:42 and stuff
00:33:44 so like yeah there's reflexes
00:33:46 and there's like stuff but there's like
00:33:48 there's sort of puzzles in that
00:33:50 to figure out too where you go oh I can use
00:33:52 that bit
00:33:54 and if I do it just like this then it works
00:33:56 like 99% of the time
00:33:58 there's definitely things you can learn
00:34:00 but like the game is teaching you
00:34:02 as you play it
00:34:04 twitch reflexes and muscle memory
00:34:06 will not help you get better
00:34:08 at phantom horn revenge
00:34:10 phantom's revenge
00:34:12 phantom's revenge
00:34:14 so it's purely a 100%
00:34:16 intelligence test this only
00:34:18 the only thing is the brain
00:34:20 knowing
00:34:22 and I don't have that you see
00:34:24 knowing how to beat it yeah it takes some
00:34:26 oh you gotta learn
00:34:28 you gotta learn like the room
00:34:30 layouts and you gotta like remember
00:34:32 like when
00:34:34 when enemies are coming
00:34:36 oh I definitely got
00:34:38 used to
00:34:40 to the first
00:34:42 is it a spoiler to say how many
00:34:44 rooms I got through
00:34:46 no that's fine
00:34:48 the first seven rooms
00:34:50 I memorized them pretty well because I couldn't get past
00:34:52 the seventh one
00:34:54 yeah
00:34:56 it's a little bit of a
00:34:58 as I was
00:35:00 deciding like the room layouts
00:35:02 I was like
00:35:04 you know I want the game to be very exacting
00:35:06 and I want you to have to really know it
00:35:08 to beat it
00:35:10 but then I was like okay so I have that one
00:35:12 design goal on the other hand
00:35:14 on the other hand
00:35:16 um
00:35:18 ludonarratively speaking
00:35:20 sorry to use that word but ludonarratively
00:35:22 speaking
00:35:24 I forget what that even means
00:35:26 it's when um oh the gameplay doesn't match the
00:35:28 story that is yeah gameplay and story
00:35:30 ludonarratively speaking and I guess this is
00:35:32 no this isn't a spoiler exactly but this is
00:35:34 about like
00:35:36 you know the final game will have story
00:35:38 elements and it and like the alpha doesn't have
00:35:40 a story yet so
00:35:42 so I guess this is a spoiler
00:35:44 kind of but not really
00:35:46 you know phantom is he is
00:35:48 fighting his way through this place
00:35:50 for the first time
00:35:52 like he is delving into
00:35:54 a
00:35:56 a dungeon essentially
00:35:58 like a game definition of a dungeon
00:36:00 uh you know
00:36:02 to get his revenge he's fighting through it
00:36:04 on his first time he wouldn't know
00:36:06 like what is coming
00:36:08 in the next room he wouldn't know
00:36:10 like oh I have to conserve this for then
00:36:12 or oh like this room will give me an opportunity
00:36:14 to you know do such and such
00:36:16 uh so I was like
00:36:18 is it ludonarrative dissonance
00:36:20 is it is it like a bad thing
00:36:22 if I'm requiring the player to know
00:36:24 stuff that phantom
00:36:26 wouldn't know and I was like
00:36:28 I guess my conclusion was yes it is
00:36:30 but
00:36:32 I don't see a way around that without
00:36:34 just like completely tanking the difficulty
00:36:36 and making the game winnable on your first try
00:36:38 which is like an unacceptable
00:36:40 compromise so I just had to say fuck it
00:36:42 I mean
00:36:44 there's a in universe built
00:36:46 in way for him to try again
00:36:48 you could just like revive with
00:36:50 endless war rules
00:36:52 no no is that not
00:36:54 is endless war not here
00:36:56 it's a bit of a spoiler but no the game does not take
00:36:58 place in lakakam
00:37:02 sucks game sucks
00:37:04 ludonarrative dissonance at
00:37:06 100% so no if he if he dies
00:37:08 in the game he is not
00:37:10 reviving and trying again he actually
00:37:12 dies for good those are the stakes
00:37:16 I mean lots of games like that but
00:37:18 what do you do
00:37:20 we all know that there's an abstraction between
00:37:22 what the character is and the player playing it
00:37:24 unless there's deliberately throw attention to
00:37:26 I guess most games
00:37:28 are like
00:37:30 you generally don't win on your first try
00:37:32 and therefore like
00:37:34 how did the player character know that he
00:37:36 had to
00:37:38 that enemy was waiting for him it's because
00:37:40 the player played this before
00:37:42 and died and tried to second
00:37:44 I guess most games are like that
00:37:46 to the point that it's kind of silly that I even thought
00:37:48 like hmm will this take
00:37:50 the player out of the gaming experience
00:37:52 I mean
00:37:54 there's certain ways
00:37:56 because it's like
00:37:58 in some games like early NES games
00:38:00 where like killing the player
00:38:02 off is like a hold over
00:38:04 from the arcade where
00:38:06 if you kill the player unfairly
00:38:08 they'll spend money to play
00:38:10 again to get extra lives
00:38:12 and then early
00:38:14 video games were like
00:38:16 unfair in ways where you couldn't see
00:38:18 stuff coming and you'd need to die over
00:38:20 and over again in order to figure out exactly
00:38:22 what you should do on the way through
00:38:24 so that you don't fucking kill yourself
00:38:26 and then
00:38:28 that's annoying
00:38:30 but it's a challenging
00:38:32 experience and some games are good like that
00:38:34 but more modern games
00:38:36 like Dark Souls
00:38:40 are like
00:38:42 cool
00:38:44 to me at least in the way
00:38:46 that you can see
00:38:48 everything coming as long as you
00:38:50 the player
00:38:52 are paying attention to
00:38:54 the environment
00:38:56 there's nothing that comes out except in Dark Souls 2
00:38:58 but there's nothing in Dark Souls 1, Demon Souls and stuff
00:39:00 there's nothing that
00:39:02 can surprise you that
00:39:04 it requires you to die a few times
00:39:06 to figure out what to do
00:39:08 you can
00:39:10 theoretically figure out
00:39:12 and defend against everything
00:39:14 you say that
00:39:16 and I know you're right
00:39:18 and yet
00:39:20 it never happens
00:39:22 it never happens
00:39:24 it's not like anyone ever has the
00:39:26 experience of oh I'm the chosen undead
00:39:28 and oh I could see
00:39:30 everything coming because I'm such an attentive player
00:39:32 and I was able to avoid
00:39:34 all damage
00:39:36 it's not about having a perfect run
00:39:38 it's just for the player's
00:39:40 benefit seeing that
00:39:42 if you die to something
00:39:46 and then you go back there and you're like
00:39:48 if I was cautious here
00:39:50 I would have lived
00:39:52 because I can see the thing coming
00:39:54 I can see the guy around the corner
00:39:56 it's
00:39:58 satisfying or gratifying
00:40:00 that
00:40:02 to know that you the player
00:40:04 were at fault in a death
00:40:06 and then you feel okay
00:40:08 I did that
00:40:10 bad now I must get better
00:40:12 and that's why it's so
00:40:14 because when you play a game
00:40:16 and it's like you couldn't have fucking seen something
00:40:18 coming and it's like that's bullshit
00:40:20 I hate this and you just get frustrated
00:40:22 and I usually leave
00:40:24 but like
00:40:26 yeah
00:40:28 that's what I have to say
00:40:30 I understand
00:40:32 I understand
00:40:34 I mean I guess
00:40:36 I guess the old games
00:40:38 right it was a holdover from the arcade
00:40:40 at first but then even after the arcade
00:40:42 even on console
00:40:44 like old games they had
00:40:46 they were difficult
00:40:48 as a way of extending
00:40:50 the game time yeah yeah
00:40:52 which I guess is my goal too
00:40:54 because like I'm not a
00:40:56 AAA gaming industry
00:41:00 you know
00:41:02 that was my gym sterling impression
00:41:04 AAA game
00:41:06 yeah
00:41:08 the
00:41:10 I'm not that I'm just a guy
00:41:12 I'm making a short little game
00:41:14 and yeah making it
00:41:16 hard is a way that like
00:41:18 the player will have to
00:41:20 it won't be over in
00:41:22 5 minutes and 57 seconds
00:41:24 maybe it'll take
00:41:26 an hour or half an hour
00:41:28 or whatever
00:41:30 make it a little more of a substantial
00:41:32 experience which I guess
00:41:34 is cheap in a way
00:41:36 but also it's sort of
00:41:38 a gaming tradition and probably
00:41:40 generally accepted as
00:41:42 fine as long as it doesn't
00:41:44 push into obnoxious territory
00:41:46 and I mean each run
00:41:48 is pretty short so I'm hopefully
00:41:50 like yeah because it's
00:41:52 really bad when it's like oh I couldn't have seen
00:41:54 that coming it's really bad when like
00:41:56 oh you've been playing for half an hour
00:41:58 and it sets you back all that way right
00:42:00 that's why nobody minds that shit kills you all the
00:42:02 time in Meat Boy because you respawn
00:42:04 in like 30 seconds and it's just like do it again
00:42:06 do it again do it again so like a run
00:42:08 of Phantom's Revenge is only a few minutes so
00:42:10 that's all you can be said back if you lose
00:42:12 the only way it would be
00:42:14 bad in Phantom's Revenge if
00:42:16 was if there were
00:42:18 too many variables too many things to try
00:42:20 and like too many things
00:42:22 to memorize at where
00:42:24 to the point where you would have to start writing down
00:42:26 like
00:42:28 every single encounter every single turn
00:42:30 to do and then trial and error
00:42:32 trying everything
00:42:34 but you don't have to do that you can
00:42:36 figure out quite a lot by
00:42:38 just you know
00:42:40 simple logic like what haven't I tried
00:42:42 like oh if
00:42:44 this item if I don't have any of these
00:42:46 items at this point then I'm fucked
00:42:48 so I gotta keep at least one or
00:42:50 you know some something like that
00:42:52 where it's the the solution
00:42:54 to the problem is pretty obvious if you run out of
00:42:56 slime it's because you took too many hits
00:42:58 or it could be because
00:43:00 you attacked too much
00:43:02 you know so you learn
00:43:04 by the way you
00:43:06 lose what you need to
00:43:08 alter in the next play
00:43:10 play through so it's like it's it's doable
00:43:12 I feel like I could do it
00:43:14 there are a few
00:43:16 I don't know
00:43:18 there are um yeah
00:43:20 there there are a few things
00:43:22 that I think are maybe like oh okay
00:43:24 maybe like if you
00:43:26 are someone
00:43:28 that has like a bad memory maybe there are a couple
00:43:30 points where you're like you might write down
00:43:32 like okay in this room
00:43:34 I should do this because
00:43:36 I mean I've probably forgotten all of the things
00:43:38 in the next room yeah but there's not
00:43:40 that many of them and probably you could
00:43:42 just kind of keep them in your head and remember
00:43:44 or or not uh I don't know
00:43:46 yeah uh
00:43:48 yeah I mean so
00:43:50 you know I've learned a lot
00:43:52 I guess I've learned a bunch
00:43:54 I guess it's given me a like
00:43:56 hearing people's input
00:43:58 has given me a bunch to consider
00:44:00 I'm hoping that a few more people
00:44:02 will beat it in the coming
00:44:04 days
00:44:06 before
00:44:08 I would like to say
00:44:10 that I could have the final
00:44:12 version done this month
00:44:14 but
00:44:16 I don't know if I could have the final version
00:44:18 and all of the like the
00:44:20 comic pages that I want to release with it
00:44:22 because I want to release a bunch
00:44:24 of comic pages that lead up to it and sort
00:44:26 of come after it
00:44:28 along with the game itself
00:44:30 so I don't know if I could do all of that
00:44:32 in this month but I want to give
00:44:34 it my best shot oh
00:44:36 and then um
00:44:38 some a couple people asked
00:44:40 this is the thing that
00:44:42 I was waiting for
00:44:44 that I wanted to have done before
00:44:46 um
00:44:48 Sonichu 102 so when
00:44:50 Phantom's Revenge is done
00:44:52 and it comes out along with the
00:44:54 final pages of Slime and Punishment
00:44:56 then I will finally be ready
00:44:58 to be like ok mission accomplished
00:45:00 I can put
00:45:02 I can finally release
00:45:04 Sonichu 102
00:45:06 so that'll be a glorious day
00:45:08 it'll all come together
00:45:10 it'll all come together
00:45:12 I love it when a plan comes together
00:45:14 this is my this is my
00:45:16 long game my stupid and
00:45:18 probably pointless long game but I just
00:45:20 really I just had
00:45:22 a vision it's just like
00:45:24 it's just like Phantom's Revenge itself I had
00:45:28 I don't know if it's good or bad
00:45:30 I just have a very specific
00:45:32 vision and I feel compelled
00:45:34 like I must make reality
00:45:36 I must make reality
00:45:38 reflect this
00:45:40 very specific vision that I have
00:45:42 and it will be this way or it will be no way
00:45:44 and that's
00:45:46 that's how it is
00:45:48 it's really
00:45:50 exciting seeing this
00:45:52 little project this game
00:45:54 I'm excited
00:45:56 it's legitimately cool it's like
00:45:58 it's a little
00:46:00 you know obviously not all the graphics
00:46:02 are there yet but it's the stuff
00:46:04 that is there is really good
00:46:06 it's very solid
00:46:08 it feels like more
00:46:10 I don't know
00:46:12 I don't know if well built
00:46:14 is the right term
00:46:16 but like
00:46:18 the first page of the champion
00:46:20 had that little video game
00:46:22 thing
00:46:24 it feels a little
00:46:26 like more advanced from that
00:46:28 and it's
00:46:30 obviously it's a lot more advanced because it's like
00:46:32 actual gameplay
00:46:34 this game actually has
00:46:36 numbers in it
00:46:38 in the champion
00:46:40 it's the point
00:46:42 that she's so powerful that nothing
00:46:44 can touch her but like
00:46:46 still means there's not much like
00:46:48 replay value for that
00:46:50 I feel like in a way
00:46:52 in a certain way
00:46:54 Phantom of Revenge is kind of the sequel to
00:46:56 that game never really had a name
00:46:58 just the champion
00:47:00 page zero
00:47:02 prelog or something
00:47:04 yeah like
00:47:06 because it sort of starts out in the same way because
00:47:08 minor spoiler
00:47:10 the first enemies you encounter
00:47:12 in Phantom's Revenge can't hurt you
00:47:14 just like the enemies can't hurt
00:47:16 Sophia
00:47:18 but then
00:47:20 after a room or two
00:47:22 some enemies arrive that can hurt you
00:47:24 and in the final version
00:47:26 that'll be justified
00:47:28 you'll understand why that's the case
00:47:30 in universe but so
00:47:32 because it sort of starts out in the same
00:47:34 like the main character is invincible
00:47:36 I feel sort of like
00:47:38 that champion game
00:47:40 iterated upon to like
00:47:42 but then let's introduce some enemies
00:47:44 that are an actual threat
00:47:46 haha
00:47:48 that's I don't know
00:47:50 that's a
00:47:52 feeling I have about it
00:47:54 I don't know
00:47:56 I'm very gratified that
00:47:58 some people have complimented my
00:48:00 sprite work and the animations
00:48:02 I put a lot
00:48:04 I put a lot of it work into the sprites
00:48:06 and the
00:48:08 the timing because you have to like
00:48:10 in game maker studio you have to go in
00:48:12 and you have to like
00:48:14 tell the object like
00:48:16 okay
00:48:18 when the menu sends this command
00:48:20 like when the menu says phantom
00:48:22 an attack command it's like okay
00:48:24 pause the menu commands
00:48:26 pause all the other game functions
00:48:28 then the phantom or horn object
00:48:30 begins a timer
00:48:32 and then the timer starts counting
00:48:34 and then the timer counts
00:48:36 it does all these operations on him
00:48:38 to like change his position
00:48:40 and change his sprite
00:48:42 all with very precise timing
00:48:44 and it does certain if l statements to determine
00:48:46 like what attack he does
00:48:48 and then he does the sound effect
00:48:50 and then he does the sprite
00:48:52 and then when he ends his animation
00:48:54 it's like okay where is he
00:48:56 where does he need to go
00:48:58 okay have him move in this path
00:49:00 to get back to his original position
00:49:02 where he'll like sort of like bounce a little bit
00:49:04 to give himself sort of like that bounce back
00:49:06 that like lends a little more weight
00:49:08 to a movement in animation
00:49:10 and
00:49:12 it's just a lot of little bit
00:49:14 and he does the him and
00:49:16 other things they do the
00:49:18 when they move
00:49:20 and they land at their final position
00:49:22 they have a little like sort of dust cloud that kicks up
00:49:24 from their feet where they move to
00:49:26 to sort of give a sense that
00:49:28 they've stopped their movement
00:49:30 yeah I had that same
00:49:32 I did that same thing with the
00:49:34 yeah with the dust cloud in
00:49:36 the champion
00:49:38 game had the same thing
00:49:40 so I put a lot a lot of work into that
00:49:42 and so it's nice that some people appreciated it
00:49:44 and I'm like yes I did it
00:49:46 I did a couple of good things
00:49:48 and
00:49:50 I don't know I want to add more
00:49:52 like the drinking animation
00:49:54 I want to improve and stuff
00:49:56 oh boy
00:49:58 um
00:50:00 I was like I feel like I might have had
00:50:02 one more thing to say about that but
00:50:04 we've talked for like
00:50:06 45 minutes about that
00:50:08 uh
00:50:10 it's a big moment
00:50:12 but yeah it is a big moment
00:50:14 it won't be it's not as big as when the final one
00:50:16 comes out and people can actually play it that'll be the real
00:50:18 that'll be the real poggers moment
00:50:22 I gotta get my secret
00:50:24 project up the ground
00:50:26 it's still
00:50:28 I mean since I've been ill it's been like
00:50:30 paused for a while
00:50:32 whole last month I didn't really do anything with it
00:50:36 why be paused when you can be pogged
00:50:40 why pog when there's nothing to look at
00:50:44 how can you pog when there's nothing to pog at Ben
00:50:46 did you see
00:50:48 on Twitter this week
00:50:50 there was some sort of kerfuffle
00:50:52 about
00:50:54 pogs like PAWGs
00:50:56 do you know what that is
00:50:58 uh fat ass something
00:51:00 white girls fat ass white girls
00:51:02 and
00:51:04 I gotta be honest
00:51:06 I did not look into like
00:51:08 what is the controversy about
00:51:10 I assume it's something about being white
00:51:12 um no I didn't
00:51:14 I've never I've not heard that
00:51:16 I deliberately didn't go and find out
00:51:18 like why are people arguing about
00:51:20 I was like I think I'm happy
00:51:22 or not knowing
00:51:24 maybe there's a PAWG
00:51:26 champ out there
00:51:28 pog I mean
00:51:30 if there's not
00:51:32 if there's not there should be
00:51:34 uh
00:51:36 yeah um
00:51:38 the pog champions my new comic
00:51:42 I wanna be a pog champ
00:51:44 but I can't
00:51:46 cause I'm a virgin
00:51:50 that doesn't make sense
00:51:54 well I mean I assume that
00:51:56 to be the champion
00:51:58 means you win
00:52:00 and to win
00:52:02 over a female
00:52:04 such as you fuck them
00:52:06 oh I see what you meant
00:52:08 I was thinking of like pog champion
00:52:10 being like a fat ass white girl
00:52:12 that is a champion
00:52:14 oh like I'm the champion
00:52:16 of them like I'm the king
00:52:18 of them oh no well
00:52:20 no
00:52:22 you're the fattest white ass girl there is
00:52:24 if only
00:52:26 um no
00:52:28 no no no no
00:52:30 yeah
00:52:32 okay
00:52:34 yeah top yeah
00:52:36 I wanna talk I wanna talk let me talk
00:52:38 please um no
00:52:40 okay
00:52:42 so the kato comic right
00:52:44 yes the kato anthology
00:52:46 or whatever it was called I think is that
00:52:48 yeah the kato anthology
00:52:50 yeah that is uh
00:52:52 it's ended so if you haven't submitted
00:52:54 you've fucked up submissions are over
00:52:56 submissions are over yes
00:52:58 um
00:53:00 and I this really annoyed me
00:53:02 because
00:53:04 I had I was going to
00:53:06 draw a new comic for it
00:53:08 but I was so
00:53:10 medicaled
00:53:12 I was so like hospitaled I was like
00:53:14 I was weak and
00:53:16 weary and I could barely
00:53:18 get out of bed a few days
00:53:20 and it was just sort of not
00:53:22 good so I couldn't
00:53:24 finish it I got like
00:53:26 two to three pages
00:53:28 lined I was gonna color them later
00:53:30 but I just I just ran out of time
00:53:32 so I failed on that and then
00:53:34 I put instead a snippet
00:53:36 of the lord of ghost comic so it's
00:53:38 it's something in there but
00:53:40 I'm mad

00:54:14 about a little before the show you can say as much
00:54:16 as you feel like divulging
00:54:18 okay so I forget
00:54:20 exactly where I was last
00:54:22 week in terms of
00:54:24 what is what had happened
00:54:26 but I had gone
00:54:28 I've gone to
00:54:30 doctor call me say get
00:54:32 blood test I go to hospital I do that
00:54:36 the lady who took
00:54:38 my blood because I'm scared of needles
00:54:40 so I'm like seizing up like
00:54:42 shit if I faint it's gonna
00:54:44 be really embarrassing and I want to
00:54:46 faint I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
00:54:48 like grip the arm of this chair and
00:54:50 just close my eyes and tense
00:54:52 my toes and hope that I
00:54:54 don't embarrass myself and the lady
00:54:56 taking my blood was like
00:54:58 I described
00:55:00 her in like a discord chat
00:55:02 as having big mama bear energy
00:55:04 she was really nice and sweet
00:55:06 and she calmed me down and I was based
00:55:08 nurses are epic

00:55:26 well not me thank
00:55:28 you thank you
00:55:30 no one thank you
00:55:32 who is it that provides me
00:55:34 with a free
00:55:36 free healthcare access to healthcare for all
00:55:38 nobody oops okay
00:55:40 lol lol
00:55:42 owned
00:55:44 yeah so that was
00:55:46 blood taken I didn't faint it wasn't as bad
00:55:48 as being in an IV drip
00:55:50 I don't know whether I mentioned I was at that happened
00:55:54 I went in one time as an IV drip
00:55:56 because I was super dehydrated
00:56:00 super dehydrated I get the blood
00:56:02 test sent into the lab I get a text
00:56:04 a few days later they say
00:56:06 blood levels
00:56:08 all of these other all these tests we did for these
00:56:10 generic things these are normal but this one
00:56:12 thing is abnormal
00:56:14 and we're going to have to look into it
00:56:16 we need you to come back for some follow-up blood
00:56:18 tests about your liver
00:56:20 and then I was like
00:56:22 oh
00:56:24 because I think I talked about last time like I'm
00:56:26 scared what if it's diabetes
00:56:28 mm-hmm
00:56:30 is that a liver thing I don't know much
00:56:32 that's a kidney thing
00:56:34 so it's not a liver thing
00:56:36 diabetes is a kidney thing
00:56:38 I think so kidneys like filter the
00:56:40 water blood sugar
00:56:42 I don't remember
00:56:44 something about the kidneys is what I was assuming
00:56:46 the liver produces
00:56:48 insulin
00:56:50 right
00:56:52 oh god
00:56:54 am I making a fool of myself
00:56:56 the kidneys do that and the liver
00:56:58 is creates bile for
00:57:00 digestion
00:57:02 the liver might produce
00:57:04 bile but I think the liver produces
00:57:06 insulin
00:57:08 I don't think the kidneys produce insulin
00:57:12 no your liver
00:57:14 your liver stores
00:57:16 sugar as glycogen
00:57:18 yeah sure sure
00:57:20 okay so it might be
00:57:22 I don't know
00:57:24 diabetes
00:57:26 the point is
00:57:28 I'm wrong though the liver does not produce insulin
00:57:30 okay no
00:57:32 yeah so it's probably not that then
00:57:34 but it could be like hepatitis
00:57:36 because I was just I was going on like okay
00:57:38 liver
00:57:40 could there be like
00:57:42 is there like a terrible liver
00:57:44 explodey disease
00:57:46 could I have that I looked up
00:57:48 hepatitis seems to be one of those
00:57:50 things
00:57:52 that the liver could have wrong with it
00:57:54 so I'm just looking at liver diseases
00:57:56 I had gone to the doctor
00:57:58 got the second set of blood tests
00:58:00 they're in the lab
00:58:02 it's the weekend so I assume they're not
00:58:04 doing analysis at the moment
00:58:06 and I'm gonna wait for them to get back
00:58:08 to me so
00:58:10 I don't know at the moment all I know
00:58:12 is that there's something abnormal with the something
00:58:14 in my liver
00:58:16 and that's
00:58:18 that's it so I'm just sort of trying
00:58:20 to survive and drink water
00:58:22 and eat food and be okay
00:58:24 by something abnormal
00:58:26 I mean do you mean like
00:58:28 some kind of
00:58:30 hormone or some kind of like
00:58:32 some kind of I don't know
00:58:34 what's the word enzyme
00:58:36 or something or like some
00:58:38 sort of blood
00:58:40 juice
00:58:42 oh yeah wait
00:58:44 there was on one of the forms
00:58:46 they gave me
00:58:48 for the test there was like
00:58:50 because
00:58:52 you give these forms into the blood test and then
00:58:54 they write the thing on the labels
00:58:56 so that they know what they're analyzing
00:58:58 you know
00:59:00 there's like a little
00:59:02 area for comment from the doctor
00:59:04 and the doctor was like
00:59:06 Nash question mark
00:59:08 something something I can't remember because I've given the forms
00:59:10 and I can't read them
00:59:12 Nash
00:59:14 which is apparently non-alcoholic
00:59:16 steato hepatitis
00:59:18 it's a liver inflammation
00:59:20 and damage caused by buildup of fat in the liver
00:59:24 I don't know if that's it
00:59:26 but that was just one of the things the doctor was like
00:59:28 could it be this could it be that they put a few comments
00:59:30 and but I don't know
00:59:34 so it's probably
00:59:36 I did get a call and they said
00:59:38 it's probably don't
00:59:40 worry it's probably not that
00:59:42 bad I'm like okay yeah right
00:59:44 yeah you're just trying to make me
00:59:46 not go insane right now
00:59:48 but I trust
00:59:50 classic doctors
00:59:52 back on their bullshit
00:59:54 I'm gonna trust her because
00:59:56 I'd rather feel like it's not a big deal
00:59:58 and then be scared out of my wits when they
01:00:00 tell me I got cancer and I'm gonna die
01:00:02 oh no
01:00:04 it's
01:00:06 probably not cancer
01:00:08 but it could always be something
01:00:10 terrible so
01:00:12 when things go wrong
01:00:14 it's much more often
01:00:16 not a big deal
01:00:18 than it is a big deal
01:00:20 so I mean
01:00:22 I wouldn't get too worried
01:00:24 yeah yet no I
01:00:26 I don't drink a lot so that
01:00:28 it wouldn't be alcohol related
01:00:30 yeah so it's
01:00:32 I don't know you don't I mean you don't drink
01:00:34 so how could it possibly be non-alcoholic
01:00:36 steato hepatitis
01:00:38 it just wouldn't make any sense
01:00:42 maybe the
01:00:44 the prescription is to drink more
01:00:46 maybe they'll just say you need to drink
01:00:48 you need to get fucking wasted
01:00:50 you gotta convert it to alcohol
01:00:52 steato hepatitis which is actually a good thing
01:00:54 you like that
01:00:56 the non-alcoholic version
01:00:58 is the bad kind
01:01:00 yeah
01:01:02 I mean who knows
01:01:04 I gotta pee
01:01:06 hang on
01:01:08 okay oh god
01:01:10 Eleazar you know what to do
01:01:12 you gotta cut
01:01:14 you gotta cut that shit out
01:01:16 you gotta cut that shit right out
01:01:18 boy oh you gotta take it
01:01:20 you gotta take it all away
01:01:22 you gotta take it all away
01:01:24 when you shove it
01:01:26 in my face
01:01:28 I'm living me
01:01:34 definitely cut that
01:01:36 definitely cut that part
01:01:38 don't let him hear
01:01:40 don't let them know
01:01:42 let it go
01:01:44 let it go
01:01:46 back anymore
01:01:48 sorry
01:01:50 sorry
01:01:52 you know people have been saying in the comments
01:01:54 that they want to hear me sing more
01:01:56 because they like the
01:01:58 chug jug cover
01:02:00 you know I considered recording like a full
01:02:02 version of that
01:02:04 or a longer version
01:02:06 at least with one chorus
01:02:08 with one verse
01:02:10 when I sat down to like decide what the words would be
01:02:12 I tried to write
01:02:14 a verse and the chorus
01:02:16 but I got stuck
01:02:18 I'm not very good at writing lyrics
01:02:20 so I got stuck writing them
01:02:22 and I just decided to only write
01:02:24 oh I'm talking about the
01:02:26 chug jug cover that I sang
01:02:28 and how it's only the chorus
01:02:30 and how I meant to make it longer
01:02:32 but I just
01:02:34 I was very lazy and only did
01:02:36 the like three lines
01:02:42 I'm very
01:02:44 particular
01:02:46 if I can't think of
01:02:48 if I can't think of a good
01:02:50 lyric that is like
01:02:52 funny and not awkward
01:02:54 and doesn't make me cringe then I'm like
01:02:56 no it's no good
01:02:58 throw it out
01:03:00 won't do it
01:03:02 throw it down these bare essentials
01:03:04 that's all
01:03:06 to put a cap on the
01:03:08 gib is
01:03:10 diseased thing
01:03:12 I don't know anything yet
01:03:14 I'm probably gonna be okay
01:03:18 don't worry about it
01:03:20 but if you wanted to know
01:03:22 I'll follow it up
01:03:24 if they come back
01:03:26 with the test and they say you have something
01:03:28 and I'll just say I have something
01:03:30 whatever
01:03:32 I don't want it to be like a fixture of the show
01:03:34 but I also don't want it to be a fixture of my life
01:03:36 so I'm gonna try and figure it out
01:03:38 we gotta have gib's disease corner
01:03:40 every week
01:03:42 gib's mystery disease
01:03:46 I can get a new one every week
01:03:48 guess the ailments
01:03:52 cool
01:03:54 what new malady is gib's suffering under
01:03:56 oh
01:03:58 it's just been
01:04:00 it's like low key pissing me off
01:04:02 a little bit I just
01:04:04 sure
01:04:06 you know on a good day I can get
01:04:08 a lot of work done
01:04:10 I can draw a lot of comics I can work on my secret project
01:04:12 I can do some stuff
01:04:14 these days I'm like
01:04:16 if I have a good day
01:04:18 I'm like thank fuck
01:04:20 I feel okay let's cook
01:04:22 some food
01:04:24 once instead of like ordering in
01:04:26 let's
01:04:28 tidy up let's
01:04:30 have a shower and let's do all this stuff
01:04:32 wash the dishes
01:04:34 let's sit down and relax
01:04:36 and I guess that's the good thing to do
01:04:38 but it does annoy me that the entirety of last month
01:04:40 went by and I basically did nothing
01:04:44 now this month has started
01:04:46 who knows how little I could get done
01:04:48 yeah
01:04:50 yeah not
01:04:52 that sucks
01:04:54 I
01:04:56 when you're
01:04:58 you just don't have the spoons for it
01:05:00 when you're sick you just don't have the spoons for it
01:05:02 you know what I'm fucking talking about
01:05:04 excuse
01:05:06 spoons like
01:05:08 alakazam from pokemon
01:05:10 yes
01:05:12 no like
01:05:14 wait the hussy references
01:05:16 in psycholoneals
01:05:18 once or twice
01:05:20 I don't know spoons
01:05:22 it's a metaphor
01:05:24 for like
01:05:26 people with like disability
01:05:28 when people talk about disability they talk about spoons
01:05:30 but it applies to everyone
01:05:32 it's just like the metaphor that
01:05:34 you only have a certain amount of energy
01:05:36 to expend
01:05:38 in a day and like when you spend all your spoons
01:05:40 you can't do anything else
01:05:42 and like when you're disabled
01:05:44 when you're sick it's like the number
01:05:46 you have fewer spoons than the average person
01:05:48 and you just can't
01:05:50 oh that's right there was that spoons
01:05:52 there was that spoons meter that depleted
01:05:54 I didn't know what that was about
01:05:56 Z has a
01:05:58 yep it's uh it's
01:06:00 I don't know I've heard it here and there
01:06:02 most in the context of
01:06:04 talking about disability
01:06:06 but it's generally applicable
01:06:08 it's like
01:06:10 I know I shouldn't beat myself up
01:06:12 over stuff and I'm not really doing that
01:06:14 but I can't help but
01:06:16 keep it in my mind a little because I want to
01:06:18 I want to like hit the ground running
01:06:20 whenever I can
01:06:22 if I get feel better and I'm like
01:06:24 okay no reason to like
01:06:26 ease my way back into work
01:06:28 if I feel good or if I get the medicine
01:06:30 I need and I can start I just
01:06:32 I want to be ready to get back
01:06:34 to doing things because
01:06:36 I have a secret project and I want to announce it
01:06:38 I want people to say oh this is based
01:06:40 that's what I want that's the only reason
01:06:42 I'm having a secret project is because Ben had one
01:06:44 I made it up immediately
01:06:46 as soon as Ben said I have a secret project
01:06:48 and I was like I have to copy Ben saying
01:06:50 make my own oh shit I need
01:06:52 a secret project now fuck
01:06:56 it's not true but I but I feel
01:06:58 I fear that some people assume that
01:07:00 just cuz it's not true
01:07:02 but it's not true and I know it's not true
01:07:04 but I believe it anyway
01:07:06 I believe it
01:07:08 do you have that do you have like fear
01:07:10 of like people assuming
01:07:12 you're a copycat I don't know what you would call
01:07:14 that
01:07:16 I feel like I've talked about it before
01:07:18 fear of people
01:07:20 I don't know if I
01:07:22 I don't know if that's a particular fear
01:07:24 I mean I
01:07:26 sometimes I don't really get
01:07:28 I'm not really like scared of it but like
01:07:30 it's something that comes up when like
01:07:32 ah I have a secret project
01:07:34 around the same time Ben does
01:07:36 oh yeah because every time
01:07:38 like I want to like review
01:07:40 Shrek 2
01:07:42 I'm like oh I want to do this but then like
01:07:44 somebody else on their channel
01:07:46 already reviewed Shrek 2
01:07:48 that I can't review Shrek 2
01:07:50 only one reviewer can have a movie
01:07:52 yeah no I know exactly what you're talking about
01:07:54 big copycat energy
01:07:56 and it's just a bad look
01:08:00 yeah no but like
01:08:02 yeah if I do something
01:08:04 something yeah with
01:08:06 I don't know I'm trying to think when the last time
01:08:08 I felt it was
01:08:10 I mean another thing
01:08:12 I guess if I do something like
01:08:14 like the Winnie the Pooh reviews
01:08:16 right when I did those I had a feeling like
01:08:18 boy
01:08:20 this is me like doing like
01:08:22 a retrospective about a cartoon
01:08:24 which like a million and one
01:08:26 other people have done that's like a pretty
01:08:28 common thing to do on YouTube feels kind of
01:08:30 derivative kind of just feels like
01:08:32 I'm doing what all those other guys do
01:08:34 people are going to roll their eyes at me
01:08:36 when I do it yeah like I had a bit of that
01:08:38 feeling so I know
01:08:40 I mean that's a little different because
01:08:42 my secret project is not the same
01:08:44 type of thing as yours
01:08:46 uh oh spoilers
01:08:48 um well
01:08:50 but there's other things
01:08:52 like I've seen this
01:08:54 and it annoys me a little bit I'm not that
01:08:56 bothered by it but like yeah
01:08:58 when people
01:09:00 ascribe like my transition
01:09:02 to Digi
01:09:04 or Trixie I should say
01:09:06 like Trixie transitioned
01:09:08 and that
01:09:10 like put in motion me and I'm like
01:09:12 no you don't understand
01:09:14 what was going on in my head before that point
01:09:16 no
01:09:18 and there was even a moment
01:09:20 in like at Radcon 4 when I was
01:09:22 wearing like the punk cosplay
01:09:24 or the
01:09:26 the uh the what
01:09:28 shoot for the calendar shoot
01:09:30 uh huh
01:09:32 like Trixie was not
01:09:34 like going for feminine
01:09:36 at the time no and I was
01:09:38 I was kind of going for feminine
01:09:40 yeah she did like the
01:09:42 I feel like she was inspired by the way
01:09:44 I looked and I was like
01:09:46 oh that's cool but now people
01:09:48 just because Trixie came out first
01:09:50 people think I'm
01:09:52 I was I'm not copying anyone
01:09:54 I think didn't
01:09:56 she say specifically
01:09:58 that she was kind of inspired
01:10:00 by
01:10:02 you know
01:10:04 she probably said it about other people
01:10:06 but she did she did
01:10:08 she did tell
01:10:10 she told
01:10:12 she told me that like the way that I looked
01:10:14 uh uh
01:10:16 was like
01:10:18 the makeup
01:10:20 with the eyeshadow and stuff
01:10:22 she said that like that
01:10:24 it was probably just all of us just like
01:10:26 seeing all of us like go for the girl look
01:10:28 I think yeah more
01:10:30 accurately it wasn't like anyone came first
01:10:32 yeah it was
01:10:34 the idea of it
01:10:36 was put forward
01:10:38 and then when we actually had to
01:10:40 do it some of us was like
01:10:42 uh oh
01:10:44 uh oh
01:10:46 uh oh I like it uh oh
01:10:48 this isn't good or is it
01:10:50 and and that was that
01:10:52 um LeMau
01:10:54 well I wouldn't know about that
01:10:56 it is a LeMau moment
01:10:58 a big big LeMau moment
01:11:00 um
01:11:02 no um
01:11:04 no I like the I like the eyeshadow but in like
01:11:06 uh but in like a I'm a cool
01:11:08 I'm a cool like goth guy
01:11:10 in like a super masculine way like
01:11:12 in like a super masculine way though
01:11:14 in a real testosterone based way I love
01:11:16 in a very yes in a very toxic
01:11:18 masculinity kind of way like
01:11:20 really fucked up
01:11:22 like I'll punch people
01:11:24 uh
01:11:26 yeah not to imply that
01:11:28 you have to transition because
01:11:30 you like makeup makeup can be for everyone
01:11:32 that's true that's true
01:11:34 um but uh
01:11:36 sure I I
01:11:38 I well I don't
01:11:40 understand but I empathize
01:11:42 I I I don't know
01:11:44 okay how about I just say okay
01:11:46 how about I just say okay to all that
01:11:48 okay
01:11:50 fine
01:11:52 um right
01:11:54 so there's no there's no pressure
01:11:56 necessarily to do anything
01:11:58 okay well
01:12:00 don't worry about it Ben
01:12:02 I'm being peer pressured
01:12:04 I'm being peer pressured
01:12:06 I'm being indoctrinated into the cultural
01:12:08 Marxist cult
01:12:10 these pink pills I have here
01:12:12 they're just they're just like props
01:12:14 they're like theater props
01:12:16 I'm gonna I'm gonna abolish
01:12:18 I'm gonna abolish capitalism
01:12:20 one of these days I'm gonna do it
01:12:22 and it's all your fault
01:12:24 please dude please
01:12:26 okay cool very good
01:12:28 oh speak you know that segues
01:12:30 perfectly speaking of abolishing capitalism
01:12:32 yesterday was May
01:12:34 day
01:12:36 um and I
01:12:38 was invited to
01:12:40 a
01:12:42 a communist rally
01:12:44 basically that's what it ended up being
01:12:46 it was
01:12:48 not very big
01:12:50 it was in it was actually in the exact same place
01:12:52 that um the other one
01:12:54 the um
01:12:56 the march that I went to after the George Floyd
01:12:58 stuff
01:13:00 oh that was on the 4th of July
01:13:02 so this was on god that was almost
01:13:04 almost a year ago oh my god
01:13:06 it was in the exact same place
01:13:08 this one was much smaller
01:13:10 and it was a bunch of people
01:13:12 who were trans
01:13:14 not like most of them but like a significant number of them
01:13:16 um and they
01:13:18 you know they gave some
01:13:20 speeches this was like
01:13:22 there had been like previous
01:13:24 activities in other places
01:13:26 the thing had moved from like downtown to it had moved to this
01:13:28 the place was called newbie and square
01:13:30 this was in like a sort of
01:13:32 a slightly more off the beaten
01:13:34 path part of Boston
01:13:36 um uh uh
01:13:38 and then and then
01:13:40 it was sort of like the final
01:13:42 meetup followed by like one final like last
01:13:44 march like back to
01:13:46 the downtown area so there weren't that many
01:13:48 people there maybe there had been more in the day this was pretty small
01:13:50 there were probably like maybe
01:13:52 40 people 30 or 40 people
01:13:54 um
01:13:56 and um
01:13:58 they had they had uh the anarcho communist flags
01:14:00 uh you know they had red flags
01:14:02 and stuff they had
01:14:04 international workers of the world
01:14:06 flag I just thought was pretty cool
01:14:08 uh they gave some speeches they talked
01:14:10 about like programs
01:14:12 one girl gave
01:14:14 an announcement about like an org
01:14:16 that they were founding which actually sounded pretty cool and it was called
01:14:18 it was called blue
01:14:20 oh god
01:14:22 blue crime blue dime
01:14:24 that's what it was and it was an organization
01:14:26 dedicated to pushing
01:14:28 for like legislation
01:14:30 and like
01:14:32 court rulings I guess
01:14:34 in favor of police
01:14:36 basically being forced to like
01:14:38 pay for their own crimes
01:14:40 instead of like taxpayer money
01:14:42 covering it which is what
01:14:44 uh usually happens
01:14:46 so I thought that was pretty cool
01:14:48 um and we did the march
01:14:50 and the march was definitely
01:14:52 illegal
01:14:54 um the march was
01:14:56 nice the march was most definitely
01:14:58 not like sanctioned by anyone
01:15:00 there was no
01:15:02 there was it was like blocking traffic
01:15:04 cars were honking at us
01:15:06 uh
01:15:08 uh buses were definitely
01:15:10 held up uh which was very funny
01:15:12 uh the guy
01:15:14 I don't I actually
01:15:16 the the person leading it I
01:15:18 genuinely couldn't tell you if they were
01:15:20 a man or they could have been a trans mask
01:15:22 or a trans femme it was just
01:15:24 I just I just don't know I just don't know
01:15:26 but they were they were uh
01:15:28 they were yelling in a microphone
01:15:30 and we passed by like a restaurant
01:15:32 where a bunch of people were doing
01:15:34 outdoor dining and this
01:15:36 and they like screamed
01:15:38 in the microphone they're like it's May Day
01:15:40 it's May Day and you're all you're all
01:15:42 just out you're all sitting there like nothing's
01:15:44 going on fuck all of you
01:15:46 and I'm like
01:15:48 woo I'm laughing
01:15:50 I like it
01:15:52 uh I think I think it may
01:15:54 sounds pretty cool I think it may
01:15:56 I think some people some people
01:15:58 found it a little like oh this is
01:16:00 oh this is very this isn't what is this
01:16:02 accomplishing what is what is this doing
01:16:04 what is this really helping and I
01:16:06 like oh no it's great
01:16:08 no it's funny and it's cool it's good
01:16:10 uh I like it I'm totally
01:16:12 on board I'm in the road
01:16:14 I'm blocking traffic I stand in
01:16:16 solidarity um
01:16:18 where what are they
01:16:20 gonna drive to anyway somewhere
01:16:22 somewhere what are they gonna drive
01:16:24 to home from their jobs
01:16:26 to see their kids
01:16:28 god
01:16:30 give me a fucking break
01:16:32 we there was an ambulance
01:16:34 there was an ambulance and we did
01:16:36 like the the the announcer was like
01:16:38 everyone like gets the side of the road we gotta
01:16:40 let this ambulance by and we did so
01:16:42 you know we're not a complete
01:16:44 monsters about it
01:16:46 no it was good it was great
01:16:48 you know what's the point of it what's the
01:16:50 point of a protest what's the
01:16:52 point of a protest if it doesn't disrupt
01:16:54 anything like if nobody
01:16:56 is inconvenienced if no one
01:16:58 is inconvenienced by it if if you
01:17:00 if you get a fucking if you get
01:17:02 a oh yeah we scheduled
01:17:04 this with the local like with the local
01:17:06 government and like they coordinate off a little
01:17:08 section of the road and like they
01:17:10 coordinate off and like you know they're gonna get a police
01:17:12 escort you know get us through
01:17:14 you know it'll it'll last from exactly
01:17:16 you know five fifteen to six
01:17:18 to six thirty
01:17:20 uh you know during this time the roads will be
01:17:22 closed here there will be like an alternate route
01:17:24 later on if like it doesn't do anything
01:17:26 like the point of
01:17:28 I mean I guess a journalist
01:17:30 was go and have a look and I guess
01:17:32 but that would be about it
01:17:34 I guess like that's all fine if you
01:17:36 get your fucking protest like
01:17:38 approved by the local authorities
01:17:40 and schedule like that's fine no no
01:17:42 disrespect but like
01:17:44 you know thinking
01:17:46 back thinking back
01:17:48 I don't want to I don't want to compare myself
01:17:50 I don't want to compare myself to like
01:17:52 uh a fucking
01:17:54 one of the people doing like
01:17:56 us the civil rights movement
01:17:58 under like Martin Luther King or I don't want to
01:18:00 compare this to that I don't know grand
01:18:02 eyes it like that but I mean
01:18:04 those people did like sit-ins
01:18:06 and diners for instance
01:18:08 and like
01:18:10 you know that was the point
01:18:12 literally the point of that was to inconvenience
01:18:14 people and like not even
01:18:16 not even like the government
01:18:18 just like
01:18:20 people and it was just to make a point
01:18:22 and to make a public spectacle
01:18:24 the idea is to
01:18:26 get it to the point where the government
01:18:28 has to do something to alleviate
01:18:30 the situation thereby
01:18:32 causing the government
01:18:34 to pay attention to whatever was happening
01:18:36 and did it inconvenience
01:18:38 you know
01:18:40 random everyday people just trying to go about
01:18:42 their lives who had done nothing wrong
01:18:44 yep it sure did
01:18:46 but like
01:18:48 so what
01:18:50 so what you know
01:18:52 you can you can look at that
01:18:54 you can look at that fact
01:18:56 and you can think to yourself
01:18:58 well small price to pay
01:19:00 or you can be like
01:19:02 mmm you know
01:19:04 people should
01:19:06 maybe they should maybe they should be a little more civil
01:19:08 you know maybe maybe they're
01:19:10 pushing a little too hard for civil rights
01:19:12 mmm scoop
01:19:14 you know I kind of think that
01:19:16 Negro liberation
01:19:18 shouldn't maybe should
01:19:20 maybe we're not ready for it just yet scoop
01:19:22 maybe
01:19:24 maybe they should just stay in their lane scoop
01:19:26 you know what I'm saying
01:19:28 Shaggy why
01:19:30 he's
01:19:32 he's learning he's getting better he's getting better
01:19:34 he's not a Nazi anymore
01:19:36 we've de-radicalized him
01:19:38 he's got a lot to learn but he's getting better
01:19:40 I promise
01:19:42 who would have known that Shaggy would have been that guy and then Fred
01:19:44 was like the hardcore leftist
01:19:50 Fred became like an antifa
01:19:52 Fred Fred Fred is antifa
01:19:54 Fred is antifa he beat the shit out of Shaggy one day
01:19:56 he beat the shit out of Shaggy one day
01:19:58 we weren't looking
01:20:00 we weren't looking
01:20:02 okay well
01:20:04 so that's so that's my thought those are my
01:20:06 thoughts on civil disobedience
01:20:08 I was thinking if I could scoop it in a word it's good
01:20:10 political affiliations where's Velma
01:20:12 where'd she go
01:20:14 I
01:20:16 there's um
01:20:18 there's a really funny video
01:20:20 I don't know if it's from a stream or something but it's um
01:20:22 it was re it was tweeted
01:20:24 by means TV you know means TV
01:20:26 nope
01:20:28 they it's it's the same channel
01:20:30 it's the same people that made
01:20:32 Nyan Cat
01:20:34 but they like they rebrand
01:20:36 themselves into just like a full on
01:20:38 like communist like media
01:20:40 collective that is
01:20:42 that is like a
01:20:44 yeah they're like a worker they're like a co-op
01:20:46 they're like a cooperatively run
01:20:48 fucking
01:20:50 youtube channel
01:20:52 twitter account slash you know just sort of like a
01:20:54 social media I mean
01:20:56 empire I guess would is probably
01:20:58 overstating it but a brand
01:21:00 if you will and
01:21:02 oh this video
01:21:04 it's a guy like going through the entire
01:21:06 roster of like the latest
01:21:08 Mario Kart
01:21:10 you know going through all the characters
01:21:12 all the different variations of dry bones
01:21:14 and all the different like koopalings and stuff
01:21:16 and being like yeah this guy is like
01:21:18 a hardcore Reaganite
01:21:20 yeah this guy is Antifa
01:21:22 you know this this guy
01:21:24 is like an anarcho primitivist
01:21:26 you know this guy is really into bitcoin or whatever
01:21:28 do they have reasons or are they just looking at them
01:21:30 in the same statements
01:21:32 he does give a little bit of justification
01:21:34 for most of them I'm probably not doing it justice
01:21:36 because he does kind of explain why he thinks
01:21:38 and it's really it's really funny
01:21:42 baby Luigi's a fascist
01:21:44 I don't remember
01:21:46 one or two of them were
01:21:48 well Bowser's a fascist obviously
01:21:50 but there was more to it
01:21:52 they weren't all like super obvious
01:21:54 I'm not doing it justice
01:21:56 it made me chuckle a lot
01:22:00 I wonder if I could find that
01:22:02 I saw it like months ago
01:22:04 baby Mario's an anarcho Bidenist
01:22:08 yeah he's a twitch streamer
01:22:10 he's a voshite
01:22:12 he's a voshite twitch streamer
01:22:14 a debate bro
01:22:16 lol
01:22:20 so that was my
01:22:22 that was my May Day
01:22:24 it was pretty
01:22:26 what if a political race had blue shells
01:22:28 a political race
01:22:30 you know like the race
01:22:32 like a Koopas
01:22:34 no like in like politics
01:22:36 so they say it's like a race
01:22:38 oh that's what they did to Bernie
01:22:40 Bernie was the front runner in the DNC
01:22:42 and then Biden fucking blue shelled him
01:22:44 so true
01:22:46 he was in last place
01:22:48 he was in last place
01:22:50 so he got the blue shell and it changed everything
01:22:52 it was the worst
01:22:54 mother fucker
01:22:56 it was malarkey
01:22:58 it was pure
01:23:00 unadulterated malarkey
01:23:02 um
01:23:04 that was my May Day
01:23:06 I have one, I have notes here
01:23:08 I have a couple of notes on my notepad
01:23:10 there's one
01:23:12 sad story that I have to relate
01:23:14 I think
01:23:16 okay
01:23:18 before Covid there was a thing
01:23:20 called mice
01:23:22 which stands for
01:23:24 Massachusetts independent
01:23:26 comics expo
01:23:28 and once a year
01:23:30 at a place pretty close to my house
01:23:32 like you know like two fucking bus stops
01:23:34 down for me or whatever
01:23:36 or tea stops
01:23:38 they would have this thing
01:23:40 and it's basically comic
01:23:42 artists go and they have tables
01:23:44 and you can buy their shit
01:23:46 and I hate it
01:23:48 I hate going to it
01:23:50 but it's because I don't want to buy anything
01:23:52 but for a couple years now I have been
01:23:54 wanted to like try tabling
01:23:56 cause like I've never tabled at a con
01:23:58 or anything but it's a thing that people do
01:24:00 that people like me do
01:24:02 people that sell comic books or whatever
01:24:04 and I feel like mice would be the perfect place to do it
01:24:06 and I
01:24:08 should really see if they're gonna have one
01:24:10 in 2022 and see if I can sign up for one
01:24:12 um
01:24:14 cause I still want to do it next time they have it
01:24:16 um but last time
01:24:18 I think this would have been late 2019
01:24:20 I went to it, I hated it
01:24:22 I did meet a couple of famous people
01:24:24 who I knew
01:24:26 Casey Green was there
01:24:28 he was sitting at a table, he was selling his shit
01:24:30 and there was also
01:24:32 you know Casey Green
01:24:34 do you know
01:24:36 you might not know this other person, Abby Howard
01:24:38 nope
01:24:40 okay well she
01:24:42 she does um
01:24:44 she did comics
01:24:46 I think she's
01:24:48 does a lot of like more commercial illustrations
01:24:50 for like
01:24:52 children's books
01:24:54 a lot of like zoology themed like kids
01:24:56 texts
01:24:58 and stuff I think is what she's doing a lot of now
01:25:00 but she um
01:25:02 she used to do comics but the reason I knew her is because
01:25:04 she got her break
01:25:06 I guess you would call it on
01:25:08 uh she was on strip search
01:25:10 she was one of the contestants on strip search
01:25:12 she didn't win I think she was like
01:25:14 she was one of the finalists though
01:25:16 and then she went on to do a kickstarter for
01:25:18 what she had come up with in the course of that show
01:25:20 the comic was called The Last Halloween
01:25:22 I think the kickstarter raised like $50,000
01:25:24 so pretty good
01:25:26 anyway she was there
01:25:28 and I got uh I said hi to her
01:25:30 she was on it and I was like can I get a picture with you
01:25:32 and she was like yes and I got a picture with her
01:25:34 and
01:25:36 I realized
01:25:38 yesterday I think I lost the picture
01:25:40 I don't think it exists anymore
01:25:42 I think
01:25:44 it was on my old phone that I lost
01:25:46 at that bar
01:25:48 um you know
01:25:50 early last year
01:25:52 yeah I lost my phone at that bar
01:25:54 and it was the worst thing that ever happened to me
01:25:56 did I talk about
01:25:58 that you did talk about losing your phone
01:26:00 and how I went back to the bar
01:26:02 and the bartender like sneered at me
01:26:04 and like glared at me like I was like
01:26:06 like he hated me and I felt like so bad
01:26:08 I still think about it
01:26:10 I still think about like god I
01:26:12 made that bartender hate me like I must be the worst
01:26:14 I must be the worst person
01:26:16 I must have been heckling that stand-up comedian
01:26:18 like so bad like everyone in the room
01:26:20 must have thought I was the biggest loser
01:26:22 I made a fool of myself and I can never
01:26:24 show my face in public again
01:26:26 I'm getting upset
01:26:28 I'm getting upset just thinking about it
01:26:30 um anyway
01:26:32 did it not go to like google photos or anything
01:26:34 yeah it's
01:26:36 it's worth checking
01:26:38 I actually I have a couple of like hard
01:26:40 drives that I think it's possible
01:26:42 that it might have backed
01:26:44 my phone up at some point on
01:26:46 and also it's possible that it might
01:26:48 have gone to like google
01:26:50 the cloud somewhere
01:26:52 maybe I don't know I need to check
01:26:54 but I as of right now
01:26:56 I'm afraid that that picture may
01:26:58 have been lost and I would be sad
01:27:00 about that
01:27:02 I'm not even like
01:27:04 I'm not even like a huge Abby Howard
01:27:06 fan it's not like I think
01:27:08 her work is like amazing
01:27:10 if she speaks to me or anything
01:27:12 I just
01:27:14 I know her from that show
01:27:16 she's kind of a big name
01:27:18 I thought it was cool that I met her
01:27:20 and I thought it was cool that I got a picture
01:27:22 with her so
01:27:24 I would be probably a little bummed
01:27:26 if it was gone but I
01:27:28 I'll look around and if
01:27:30 I do find the picture
01:27:32 I will tell Eleazar to show it
01:27:34 and if not
01:27:36 then
01:27:38 I had a thing
01:27:40 a few days well a few weeks ago
01:27:42 I realized that a whole like month
01:27:44 or something or at least
01:27:46 there was a day out it was my birthday
01:27:48 like a year or two ago
01:27:50 I went to see
01:27:52 I went to see the universal
01:27:54 Harry Potter like the
01:27:56 film set stuff
01:27:58 and I walked around and we took pictures
01:28:00 and I was like I want to look at those again
01:28:02 those are funny some of them
01:28:04 and they're all gone
01:28:06 that entire like block of time
01:28:08 is not on google photos it's not backed up
01:28:10 anywhere it's not on my phone
01:28:12 I do not remember deleting them
01:28:14 I have no idea
01:28:16 where they're gone and I was so upset
01:28:18 because I couldn't figure out
01:28:20 what the fuck happened because it was like
01:28:22 my phone went back to like
01:28:24 you know all the way to Redcon 3
01:28:26 and then like
01:28:28 everything before that
01:28:30 things after that but this one
01:28:32 like area there's just like
01:28:34 a few months where there's nothing
01:28:36 I was so upset
01:28:38 that it wasn't like stored in the cloud
01:28:40 I don't know what happened to it
01:28:42 I mean yeah
01:28:44 that would be
01:28:46 that would suck really bad
01:28:48 especially if there was like
01:28:50 some stuff that happened in that period that you
01:28:52 would like to have pictures of
01:28:54 that's lame as hell
01:28:56 why would it do
01:28:58 fuck god
01:29:00 who would have thought that
01:29:02 images
01:29:04 who would have thought that like entrusting
01:29:06 all of our fucking data
01:29:08 to these like monolithic megacorporation
01:29:10 who would have thought it could ever backfire
01:29:12 I mean it's weird though
01:29:14 cause like all of the photos are still
01:29:16 on my phone like physically
01:29:18 and they're also
01:29:20 okay so they're not gone gone
01:29:22 yeah I don't delete things
01:29:24 off my phone it's got like a big hard drive
01:29:26 capacity so I'm like
01:29:28 I don't need to delete anything
01:29:30 and I don't remember doing anything
01:29:32 like to save space
01:29:34 maybe I did
01:29:36 maybe they just deleted a few months of stuff
01:29:38 for no reason
01:29:40 maybe
01:29:42 sucks
01:29:44 sucks pretty bad
01:29:46 sucks pretty bad
01:29:48 I went to see the gringots
01:29:50 I saw the gold
01:29:52 and I saw the spiders
01:29:54 I did post a few things on my personal instagram
01:29:56 and those are the only things I have
01:29:58 from that time
01:30:00 I guess I have the memories
01:30:02 which were good
01:30:06 that's pretty good memories
01:30:08 you can't get like likes
01:30:10 and subscribes with memories
01:30:12 you can't like print that on a t-shirt
01:30:14 you can't
01:30:16 you can't sell that on gumroad
01:30:18 nope
01:30:20 yeah I can make an NFT
01:30:22 of my time at the Harry Potter thing
01:30:24 I can make an NFT of my memories
01:30:26 it'll be like a notepad document
01:30:28 that says I had a great time
01:30:30 NFT please buy
01:30:34 damn
01:30:36 I thought
01:30:38 it seemed for a minute there
01:30:40 that NFTs were over
01:30:42 but I keep seeing them
01:30:44 so
01:30:46 they caused enough of
01:30:48 a hubbub
01:30:50 that some normies
01:30:52 I don't know really whether normies
01:30:54 are the right word but like
01:30:56 crypto freak
01:30:58 people who are like less
01:31:00 internet savvy
01:31:02 just wholesale
01:31:04 bought into it because it's like
01:31:06 oh dude money
01:31:08 dude I love bitcoin
01:31:10 I love something
01:31:12 and then you know there's like a few people
01:31:14 legitimately thinking it's
01:31:16 worth their time in any way
01:31:18 it's so upsetting
01:31:20 I saw a
01:31:22 tweet from Dan Olson
01:31:24 speculating that
01:31:26 like okay
01:31:28 that maybe just a lot of this NFT stuff
01:31:30 is literally just money laundering
01:31:32 like it's just
01:31:34 rich people with dirty money
01:31:36 doing this
01:31:38 NFT thing as like
01:31:40 a cover for just like
01:31:42 moving money around in a way that like
01:31:44 will hide it
01:31:46 I mean there's no regulation
01:31:48 for the crypto currency stuff
01:31:50 so that would obviously be the way
01:31:52 to do it
01:31:54 yeah
01:31:56 which
01:31:58 honestly if that's true
01:32:00 I hope that is true because it
01:32:02 makes me less sad than like
01:32:04 thinking that like
01:32:06 a real consumer market
01:32:08 for
01:32:10 nothing which is what NFTs are
01:32:12 like exists
01:32:14 and like will continue to exist
01:32:16 I would like to think that if such a thing
01:32:18 exists it's just a front for something
01:32:20 you know
01:32:22 bad but
01:32:24 at least comprehensible
01:32:26 yeah
01:32:32 so you know
01:32:34 world is a fuck
01:32:36 yeah
01:32:38 what do you think about the voicemails
01:32:40 I think voicemails sounds good
01:32:42 I think that sounds
01:32:44 a-o-k
01:32:46 all right
01:32:48 well you got them
01:32:50 if you got them up
01:32:52 the first voicemail
01:32:54 the first voicemail
01:32:56 of the day is called
01:32:58 choose
01:33:00 choose
01:33:02 okay on 3, 2, 1, go
01:33:16 big choice
01:33:18 let die the gummies you
01:33:20 love
01:33:22 or suffer the little children
01:33:24 now choose
01:33:26 the demand
01:33:30 what
01:33:32 I could make out some of that is he saying
01:33:34 you get the gummy thingy
01:33:36 or you kill children
01:33:38 oh I thought he said the commies
01:33:40 as in like I have to choose communism
01:33:42 or kids die
01:33:44 oh if it's gummies then that's
01:33:46 that's difficult
01:33:52 all the
01:33:54 the tiki mickey mickey mouse
01:33:56 saccharide
01:34:00 I can always make more gummies
01:34:02 I can always make more gummies
01:34:04 but I can never make children
01:34:06 because I will never have sex
01:34:08 so I will sacrifice
01:34:10 the gummies
01:34:12 yes, yes
01:34:14 facts don't care about your feelings
01:34:16 Mr. Goblin sir
01:34:18 we got to choose the children
01:34:20 they're more mathematically
01:34:22 speaking they're more precious
01:34:24 just in terms of dollars in the sense
01:34:26 like if there are more children
01:34:28 then I can grow up to create
01:34:30 a malucaduca saccharides
01:34:32 that you could then use to make gummies with
01:34:34 we can put them to work
01:34:36 we can put them to work
01:34:38 in the tapioca fiber farming
01:34:40 factory
01:34:42 exactly
01:34:44 next voicemail is called
01:34:46 autism part 1
01:34:48 there's a part 1 and a part 2
01:34:50 so part 1, 3, 2, 1, go
01:34:52 I'd like to weigh in on the whole
01:34:54 self-diagnosing yourself
01:34:56 with autism thing
01:34:58 for me personally
01:35:00 it's like
01:35:02 I totally get what you're saying
01:35:04 Ben
01:35:06 there's definitely people
01:35:08 who use that as a crutch
01:35:10 right to sort of
01:35:12 as an excuse to act a certain way
01:35:14 or to absolve
01:35:16 their actions
01:35:18 but it's like
01:35:20 for me personally it's like
01:35:22 I guess
01:35:24 it's sort of a
01:35:26 I see it as somewhat of a shorthand
01:35:28 to explain myself
01:35:30 I guess
01:35:32 I've generally found that there are
01:35:34 certain ways
01:35:36 that like people
01:35:38 generally aren't
01:35:40 able to accept
01:35:42 certain facets about me
01:35:44 and it's like
01:35:46 I admit that I'm somewhat
01:35:48 attached to this interpretation
01:35:50 of myself
01:35:52 but it's like
01:35:54 it's sort of this shorthand
01:35:56 to explain these things to people
01:35:58 in a way that they can like
01:36:00 understand
01:36:02 for me it's sort of
01:36:04 it's like a shorthand
01:36:06 in that it allows me to
01:36:08 you know
01:36:10 communicate things in a way that
01:36:12 people can like empathize with
01:36:14 and like actually like understand
01:36:16 as opposed to like sort of dismissing it
01:36:18 and sort of
01:36:20 expecting me to be able to conform
01:36:22 unconditionally
01:36:24 I get this like a shorthand
01:36:26 I feel like I get what you're saying
01:36:28 let's listen to part two
01:36:30 3, 2, 1, go
01:36:32 like
01:36:34 regardless of whether or not I'm actually
01:36:36 you know
01:36:38 high enough on the spectrum
01:36:40 to be categorically classified
01:36:42 as autistic
01:36:44 I relate to enough of these
01:36:46 characteristics
01:36:48 to like enough of an extent
01:36:50 at least that it is useful for me
01:36:52 to like
01:36:54 use that
01:36:56 to attempt to explain myself
01:36:58 to people to sort of like
01:37:00 to attempt to like
01:37:02 convey like why I am
01:37:04 the way I am right and it's like
01:37:08 fuck I don't know
01:37:10 I think
01:37:12 the problem with this is the
01:37:14 wait I want to
01:37:16 love you guys keep doing what you're doing
01:37:18 I don't know
01:37:20 okay I understand that like
01:37:22 it might be useful shorthand
01:37:24 for some things
01:37:26 but is it
01:37:28 does it explain anything
01:37:30 like I think I don't know if I can
01:37:32 make the leap like it
01:37:34 describes something like if you say
01:37:36 oh yeah I'm kind of autistic
01:37:38 lol maybe that
01:37:40 says something about the way
01:37:42 you think god I don't
01:37:44 remember like all the attributes
01:37:46 you know I don't know
01:37:48 rigid thinking
01:37:50 a you know a
01:37:52 you know a resistance
01:37:54 to like a change in routine
01:37:56 you know hyper fixation on
01:37:58 certain particular
01:38:00 interests whatever
01:38:02 inability to recognize social cues
01:38:04 whatever maybe it's useful shorthand for that
01:38:06 but does it explain why
01:38:08 or are you merely describing
01:38:10 a set of traits by invoking
01:38:12 the word I don't think it explains
01:38:14 anything
01:38:16 yeah I think my problem with
01:38:18 this is
01:38:20 the implication because he said like
01:38:22 some people use it as a crutch
01:38:24 and
01:38:26 you know like that
01:38:28 idea could be bad but for him
01:38:30 it's different I feel like
01:38:32 it's still
01:38:34 up in the air regardless
01:38:36 of whether you're using it as a crutch
01:38:38 or whether it's a good shorthand
01:38:40 or not people
01:38:42 people will not necessarily
01:38:44 understand or react in the same way
01:38:46 when hearing that you have autism
01:38:48 if you make a social faux pas
01:38:50 it could be because
01:38:52 you have autism or it could be
01:38:54 because
01:38:56 you have like a lack of social practice
01:38:58 I mean even autistic people
01:39:00 need social practice it's just
01:39:02 I guess
01:39:04 I guess I would wonder
01:39:06 what the purpose is in
01:39:08 assuming it's true
01:39:10 when
01:39:12 you could just say like
01:39:14 do you have autism I don't know
01:39:16 could be could not be never had tested
01:39:18 never been tested but like
01:39:20 it's
01:39:22 I feel like
01:39:24 in a situation whether you're talking to someone
01:39:26 and then you say something and you think oh god
01:39:28 that was kind of autistic and then you say
01:39:30 to them sorry if I'm a bit autistic
01:39:32 I have autism
01:39:34 and that's just how I am
01:39:36 like what is the goal
01:39:38 with that statement is it to
01:39:40 say please treat me
01:39:42 with patients
01:39:44 or
01:39:46 or is it saying I act
01:39:48 this way please don't expect me to
01:39:50 improve like what could it be
01:39:52 used for I guess is my
01:39:54 question
01:39:56 if you
01:39:58 if you
01:40:02 as shorthand
01:40:04 for the traits
01:40:06 associated with
01:40:08 autism I guess I understand
01:40:10 why it would be useful
01:40:12 to describe
01:40:14 yourself or someone else in that way
01:40:16 I suppose but like
01:40:18 to make
01:40:20 the leap from that to saying
01:40:22 like I am autistic
01:40:24 I have autism
01:40:26 I don't know
01:40:28 if that's like the same thing
01:40:30 yeah I'm thinking like in a social situation
01:40:32 you say something that's kind of
01:40:34 a little cringe and you're like
01:40:36 sorry I'm not
01:40:38 very used to this or like I'm kind of
01:40:40 bad at talking to people like there are ways you can put it
01:40:42 that don't like ascribe a medical
01:40:44 something or other to you
01:40:46 that you may not have
01:40:48 I think being socially awkward
01:40:50 is like
01:40:52 it's something a lot of people have that doesn't
01:40:54 necessarily
01:40:56 necessarily
01:40:58 go with autism
01:41:00 like exactly you can just be
01:41:02 out of practice
01:41:04 like I feel like I may have
01:41:06 thought I could be
01:41:08 potentially autistic but I also
01:41:10 don't know
01:41:12 whether it's just a
01:41:14 like a
01:41:16 general lack of practice
01:41:18 in socializing because I
01:41:20 don't like doing it generally
01:41:22 and that's like is that
01:41:24 an autism thing or is that just a thing
01:41:26 thing like it's like a life thing
01:41:28 you could just grow and have
01:41:30 preferences for types of interactions
01:41:34 I think the
01:41:36 it may be a good
01:41:38 shorthand but like
01:41:40 it's also a medical thing
01:41:42 I don't know
01:41:44 it's an interesting question because like
01:41:46 normal people don't
01:41:48 necessarily know what it means to
01:41:50 medically be autistic or not
01:41:52 if they associate autism with
01:41:54 like being a little socially awkward
01:41:56 and you say that then they'll get it
01:41:58 that will be true but I guess
01:42:00 it won't always be true depending on who you're
01:42:02 talking to
01:42:04 like if somebody knows more
01:42:06 about autism and then you say that
01:42:08 and they're like really
01:42:10 then it's confusing
01:42:12 things where it doesn't need to but
01:42:14 I guess I would find a different
01:42:16 shorthand way of saying
01:42:18 that you have these problems or
01:42:20 just get tested and then you'll know
01:42:24 I would
01:42:26 say
01:42:28 seeing as
01:42:30 unless I'm wrong
01:42:32 and autism is not
01:42:34 a like
01:42:36 biologically based
01:42:38 I mean I think
01:42:40 it's not like
01:42:42 it is a biological
01:42:44 thing like we don't understand it
01:42:46 but it's not like a learned behavior
01:42:48 it's not a
01:42:50 socially constructed
01:42:52 condition
01:42:54 it is a
01:42:56 function of your biology
01:42:58 you either are autistic
01:43:00 or you are not and it's determined by
01:43:02 your genes
01:43:04 I mean I don't know exactly how it
01:43:06 works but the spectrum
01:43:08 if I'm wrong then like
01:43:10 fuck me and I don't know what I'm talking about
01:43:12 but that's what I think
01:43:14 and if that is true
01:43:16 the spectrum
01:43:18 the spectrum became
01:43:20 like a thing
01:43:22 at some point
01:43:24 in the past I used to think it was like
01:43:26 you either have it or you don't then there was the
01:43:28 spectrum and I heard about that and I was like
01:43:30 okay so all I really know
01:43:32 is that the science is not
01:43:34 conclusive and it is being
01:43:36 worked on and like
01:43:38 understood more as time goes on
01:43:40 so like
01:43:42 it's a
01:43:44 I mean the spectrum is like
01:43:46 in the same way I mean there's a spectrum
01:43:48 of height where like
01:43:50 some people are short
01:43:52 some people are tall
01:43:54 but there is a wide gradients
01:43:56 of
01:43:58 numbers that you could be at
01:44:00 in between those two
01:44:02 and if you're kind of in the middle are you short
01:44:04 are you tall well you're kind of in the middle
01:44:06 I mean you know
01:44:08 that's kind of an interesting metaphor
01:44:10 because
01:44:12 if everyone
01:44:14 around you is a certain height
01:44:16 and you're a little
01:44:18 taller you would be considered tall
01:44:20 even though you may be like 5 foot
01:44:22 and everyone else is 4 foot
01:44:24 right so like
01:44:26 maybe autism could work the same way
01:44:28 like it depends on your environment
01:44:30 the way that you stick out
01:44:32 in the environment
01:44:34 is like the autistic
01:44:36 like are you suggesting
01:44:38 that maybe certain populations are just
01:44:40 generally more autistic than others
01:44:42 and like within those places
01:44:44 what I'm suggesting is that
01:44:46 it's more contextual
01:44:48 than it is like absolute
01:44:50 like how many autism
01:44:52 like points does a person have
01:44:54 before they're considered autistic or not
01:44:56 or is it just how
01:44:58 they differ from the people
01:45:00 like the general
01:45:02 population that they live in
01:45:04 like if you've got all the autistic people
01:45:06 and put them in one country
01:45:08 would that become a normal country to each other
01:45:10 citizens are they all going to be normal
01:45:12 who knows
01:45:14 I don't know
01:45:16 I feel like it could work more like that
01:45:18 maybe
01:45:20 if everyone
01:45:22 if everyone was just like
01:45:24 more autistic across the board
01:45:26 I mean
01:45:28 would society like change
01:45:30 if like the general population was just
01:45:32 like more or less
01:45:34 you know autistic
01:45:36 would society like look different
01:45:38 would we have structured
01:45:40 our
01:45:42 governments and our
01:45:44 communities differently perhaps
01:45:46 probably I don't know
01:45:48 it depends on
01:45:50 when you were talking about the effects
01:45:52 I actually know like
01:45:54 literally what
01:45:56 behaviors are caused
01:45:58 by levels of
01:46:00 autism
01:46:04 I mean I don't fucking know what I'm talking about
01:46:06 there's a lot of science to this
01:46:08 I want to
01:46:10 dovetail this
01:46:12 with just a mention
01:46:14 that some people
01:46:16 last episode we got a question about
01:46:18 isn't calling yourself
01:46:20 trans kind of like being
01:46:22 kind of like just calling yourself autistic
01:46:24 and I don't want to talk too much about that
01:46:26 but I just want to say
01:46:28 if you think gender is a
01:46:30 medical condition
01:46:32 or a biological condition
01:46:34 if you think it is something that you need to be diagnosed with
01:46:36 you're just an idiot
01:46:38 you're just a complete idiot who believes in fairy tales
01:46:40 and I don't even know how to fucking fix you
01:46:42 so I'm not even going to try
01:46:46 okay I just want to mention that
01:46:48 next voicemail I guess
01:46:50 that was thought provoking though
01:46:52 that was thought provoking
01:46:54 good voicemail
01:46:56 next one is from
01:46:58 Frost Drive
01:47:00 3, 2, 1, go

01:47:28 3, 2, 1, go
01:47:30 oh my god
01:47:32 oh my fucking god this fucking idiot who comes on this show
01:47:34 last week this fucking moron this fucking pawns
01:47:36 this fucking maroon who comes on and is talking about
01:47:38 how you bend these to listen to behind the bastards
01:47:40 and the robber Evans is an arachis
01:47:42 and it'll make them stopping a fucking lectures because he talks bad about Stalin once
01:47:44 when if you listen to any of the other
01:47:46 almost any other episode
01:47:48 it's all about how companies are evil
01:47:50 how nazis are evil how the right wing
01:47:52 is evil how liberals are evil
01:47:54 his twitter banner is like
01:47:56 obviously communists
01:47:58 cause Stalin wasn't
01:48:00 Stalin was an authoritarian
01:48:02 Robert Evans is an anarchist
01:48:04 anarchists fucking hate authoritarians
01:48:06 they hate capitalists, liberals, communists
01:48:08 they fucking hate you people
01:48:10 dude dude
01:48:12 wait, Stalin did some bad things
01:48:14 like oh shit I guess
01:48:16 I guess capitalism
01:48:18 does work after all
01:48:20 I guess we shouldn't
01:48:22 open up the COVID-19
01:48:24 vaccine patents to the other countries
01:48:26 Bill Gates is right
01:48:28 Stalinist Russia and Maoist China
01:48:30 they got the flag with the red and the sickle
01:48:32 that means everything socialist
01:48:34 and communist is exactly the same as everything they did
01:48:36 it's just like that
01:48:38 it's exactly the same
01:48:40 what? that's what we want to do
01:48:42 that's what we want to do
01:48:44 such
01:48:46 such base
01:48:48 takes
01:48:50 it's not true
01:48:52 you fools
01:48:54 it's not true it's libel
01:48:56 it's slander and libel
01:48:58 good voicemail thank you
01:49:00 thank you mister response to the behind the bastards
01:49:02 guy two weeks ago
01:49:04 next voicemail is from alaskanweeb
01:49:06 three two one
01:49:08 go
01:49:10 but yeah like behind the bastards
01:49:12 is actually pretty fucking based
01:49:14 Robert Evans used to write for Cracked
01:49:16 and he has another podcast also called
01:49:18 it could happen here that's about how the United States
01:49:20 is on the precipice of a civil war
01:49:22 and it was written about two years ago
01:49:24 so there's some parts that are more focused on the election
01:49:26 but in general it's kind of timeless
01:49:28 and you should totally fucking listen to it
01:49:30 I
01:49:32 I forgot to listen to it last time
01:49:34 maybe I'll give it a try
01:49:36 this will be the time that I actually do
01:49:38 since I've since I keep getting recommendations
01:49:40 for it
01:49:42 next one is called questioning
01:49:44 benjamin sainterman's
01:49:46 leftism
01:49:48 three two one go
01:49:50 being, why don't you ever bring
01:49:52 leftist onto the podcast
01:49:54 you bring cryptophascist
01:49:56 onto the podcast but you don't reach out to leftists
01:49:58 like who
01:50:00 you have people like hungry bowtie or epic hunter
01:50:02 or that squirrel person
01:50:04 that you were talking about the other day
01:50:06 you could invite many leftists onto the podcast
01:50:08 but you don't
01:50:10 I can't get Zae Squirrel
01:50:12 I can't get Zae Squirrel
01:50:14 Zae Squirrel is too good for me
01:50:16 and I don't know who those other people you mentioned are
01:50:20 I would, what I look for in a guest
01:50:22 what I look for in a guest
01:50:24 is someone who is
01:50:26 I mean I got fucking
01:50:28 Minerva on
01:50:30 wait fuck you I got Minerva on
01:50:32 Malarion
01:50:34 die you piece of shit fucking kill yourself
01:50:36 what's wrong with you
01:50:38 this is cherry picking this is moving the goalpost
01:50:40 this is what aboutism this is
01:50:42 gish galloping
01:50:44 you piece of shit
01:50:46 okay
01:50:48 what I look for in a guest is someone
01:50:50 who is cool
01:50:52 but who is not too big
01:50:54 that they would
01:50:56 not
01:50:58 care about being on
01:51:00 you know a podcast like ours
01:51:02 with a few thousand listeners
01:51:04 Zae Squirrel
01:51:06 I don't know I don't know what Zae Squirrel is like
01:51:08 first of all I don't know
01:51:10 that she even like does
01:51:12 podcasts or any audio appearances
01:51:14 at all I'm not aware that she has ever
01:51:16 done such a thing maybe she has I don't know
01:51:18 but I mean she's like
01:51:20 she's got like she's got like 50,000 followers
01:51:22 she's a she's a much
01:51:24 bigger deal than I am
01:51:26 imagine how it looks think about how it looks
01:51:28 for some idiot
01:51:30 with 5,000 followers
01:51:32 to go to someone with 50,000 and be like
01:51:34 hey I'm a really big fan
01:51:36 would you like to come on my podcast
01:51:38 you look like a fucking moron everybody hates people like that
01:51:40 so I don't do it
01:51:42 yeah
01:51:44 yeah
01:51:46 and maybe do I maybe miss out
01:51:48 could there maybe occasionally be someone
01:51:50 who like I would be a big
01:51:52 a big scoop a big break a big hit
01:51:54 and they'd be like yeah sure and they would
01:51:56 gain to grace the PCB it's possible
01:51:58 it's possible I might have missed out
01:52:00 on some opportunities because of my Jim
01:52:02 kind of storm dancer on
01:52:04 we got Jim storm dancer on
01:52:06 but Jim storm dancer himself
01:52:08 is not famous frog fractions
01:52:10 is much more famous than Jim
01:52:12 storm storm dancer is
01:52:14 I guess so
01:52:16 I mean that's why I asked him
01:52:18 is because I looked at his Twitter and I saw that
01:52:20 like he's only got like 8,000
01:52:22 followers like he's not like a huge
01:52:24 personality
01:52:26 on social media he might be within
01:52:28 he's got a Twitter
01:52:30 he might be
01:52:32 you know willing and I was exactly
01:52:34 right and he was and he came on the show
01:52:36 and it was legendary
01:52:38 legendary
01:52:40 so
01:52:42 left us are small but
01:52:44 cool
01:52:46 are there any I mean if you've heard of them there's not
01:52:48 if you've heard of them
01:52:50 honestly I was shocked that
01:52:52 Minerva came on
01:52:54 she's got like
01:52:56 she's got like hundreds of thousands
01:52:58 of
01:53:00 well the reason I asked her is because
01:53:02 she like responded to one of my tweets
01:53:04 and like she knew who I was
01:53:06 so I was like
01:53:08 oh okay well hey would you like to come on my podcast
01:53:10 I wouldn't have just asked her that out of the blue
01:53:12 because
01:53:14 she's got more
01:53:16 cloud than me
01:53:18 your
01:53:20 Christian lecture has like
01:53:22 over a million views now right
01:53:24 it's got a million views but
01:53:26 my channel is only 17k
01:53:28 which is like more of a
01:53:30 people find videos and they're like
01:53:32 I don't know
01:53:34 you might be able to like
01:53:36 like say hey I'm like
01:53:38 I got a podcast
01:53:40 you want to be on it you've seen that video loads of people have seen those videos
01:53:42 that's true
01:53:44 I mean that is true
01:53:46 that is true
01:53:48 yeah but
01:53:50 you know what I'm not going to go around
01:53:52 asking like hey have you seen that Christian
01:53:54 lecture that I made it's got
01:53:56 a million views you must have seen it
01:53:58 it's got a million views
01:54:00 you must have seen it
01:54:02 yeah it's obviously not the way to do it like that but like
01:54:04 I don't know I feel like maybe you have more
01:54:06 cloud potential than you
01:54:08 realize
01:54:10 I
01:54:12 maybe but
01:54:14 I feel like
01:54:16 waiting for someone to know me
01:54:18 is the
01:54:20 is the only acceptable is like the only
01:54:22 like socially acceptable way to do it
01:54:24 sure I can't go around
01:54:26 go around asking people
01:54:28 yeah I don't know so that's why
01:54:30 but fuck you I've had
01:54:32 I've had a bunch of fucking left
01:54:34 us on just not just not specifically
01:54:36 the ones you're thinking of and I'm so
01:54:38 sorry okay
01:54:40 next one you know
01:54:42 maybe maybe I'm speaking out of turn to say
01:54:44 that about Minerva but I mean from her
01:54:46 tweets it really seems like she's
01:54:48 she's uh
01:54:50 she's of a mind she's on the
01:54:52 she's on the wavelength
01:54:54 that's just my assumption though
01:54:56 next voicemail is called
01:54:58 the third stage of grief
01:55:00 three two one go
01:55:02 does anybody else have contact with this
01:55:04 ghost lightning person that Trixie has
01:55:06 mentioned a million fucking times before
01:55:08 like anybody that Trixie
01:55:10 actually respects and will listen to
01:55:12 that isn't like a fucking crazy
01:55:14 sociopath or whatever
01:55:16 we talked to that person
01:55:18 can somebody fix this
01:55:20 please fuck man
01:55:22 um
01:55:24 ghost lightning is just on twitter
01:55:26 um they're not
01:55:28 like particularly well known or anything
01:55:30 I don't know if Trixie
01:55:32 even like communicates with him
01:55:34 anymore
01:55:36 probably not
01:55:38 Trixie doesn't like communicate with anyone
01:55:40 about her weird little her weird little cult
01:55:42 um
01:55:44 so
01:55:46 but ghost if you want to contact ghost
01:55:48 lightning he's just a guy on twitter
01:55:50 you can anyone can just talk to him
01:55:52 um
01:55:54 next voicemail is called time for
01:55:56 some jerking three two one
01:55:58 go
01:56:00 sometimes
01:56:02 when I look through my patreon
01:56:04 I forget that you guys are
01:56:06 really fucking talented when it comes to
01:56:08 drawing or doing what a recreative work
01:56:10 that you do and I just want to say
01:56:12 please keep going you guys are very
01:56:14 talented and I care about your work
01:56:16 thank you bye bye
01:56:18 what the fuck yeah that was nice
01:56:20 what the fuck
01:56:22 thank you
01:56:24 I will keep going I'm so you know
01:56:26 I had um
01:56:28 it was a it was a relief it was a relief
01:56:30 to put the game demo out because I felt
01:56:32 like it had been a while since I had really
01:56:34 put out like a substantive like
01:56:36 I made a thing
01:56:38 uh I had been feeling like
01:56:40 for a while like oh god I don't do
01:56:42 anything like oh god
01:56:44 um so that that feeling
01:56:46 has been um momentarily alleviated
01:56:48 uh which is nice
01:56:50 um
01:56:52 next voicemail is called
01:56:54 I don't know I didn't pay for
01:56:56 it three two one go
01:56:58 all right first time
01:57:00 here's my thought
01:57:02 that lecture that everyone's mad about
01:57:04 right yeah what if
01:57:06 it was just
01:57:08 some kind of technical failure
01:57:10 like you guys
01:57:12 were done recording then
01:57:14 Trixie looked
01:57:16 oh shit I didn't hit record
01:57:18 or like later
01:57:20 she puts it on some
01:57:22 shitty hard drive
01:57:24 without backing it up and it
01:57:26 just dies and it's kind of her fault
01:57:28 what if it
01:57:30 that's all it was
01:57:32 and she just decided
01:57:34 to make a big thing
01:57:36 a big ideological thing
01:57:38 out of it just
01:57:40 so she wouldn't have to admit
01:57:42 she fucked up
01:57:44 I mean
01:57:46 he's saying that that could be
01:57:48 the case I don't think that would be the case
01:57:50 well I
01:57:52 like why would she lie about that
01:57:54 I don't know why did she do
01:57:56 anything um
01:57:58 I would I don't think that's
01:58:00 the most likely explanation
01:58:02 but it could
01:58:04 I mean I could see it being
01:58:06 true maybe but if it was
01:58:08 true like it wouldn't really change my opinion
01:58:10 about anything
01:58:12 I mean if it was
01:58:14 true like if it was like a fat 32
01:58:16 moment and like
01:58:18 and and
01:58:20 and if that was the case
01:58:22 Trixie would just be able to say yeah
01:58:24 the hard drive failed it's gone
01:58:26 and then we'd honestly it would
01:58:28 be a better excuse yeah
01:58:30 that would be a much better excuse
01:58:32 that would because because what would we even
01:58:34 say about that like
01:58:36 we just have to accept it
01:58:38 like you can't really yeah honestly she should
01:58:40 have honestly if she just didn't want to accept
01:58:42 it she should have just quietly deleted
01:58:44 it and then like pretended that there was
01:58:46 that there was a technical failure it would
01:58:48 have worked out better um
01:58:50 so but
01:58:52 I don't know
01:58:54 I don't know
01:58:56 I don't know
01:58:58 who knows
01:59:00 um probably probably not though
01:59:02 uh next one is called
01:59:04 good taste three two
01:59:06 one go
01:59:08 hey Ben so listen into that
01:59:10 song you recommended a while back the uh
01:59:12 fucking come clean nightcore

01:59:18 song it slaps
01:59:20 absolutely if there's any other songs
01:59:22 that you guys would recommend

01:59:52 a sea shanty
01:59:54 stuck in my head I've been like singing it
01:59:56 in the shower actually
01:59:58 I had a dream
02:00:00 I had a dream and I don't really remember
02:00:02 what the dream was I I remember
02:00:04 it took place in a school
02:00:06 and a song came on
02:00:08 on the intercom
02:00:10 and it made me cry in the dream
02:00:12 and I woke up
02:00:14 and I wanted to
02:00:16 and I just was
02:00:18 and I had it I was like what was the song
02:00:20 I couldn't really remember but I thought maybe it was this song
02:00:22 and it was the sea shanty
02:00:24 that I had heard posted around
02:00:26 like remember
02:00:28 at the beginning of the year when there was like
02:00:30 the little sea shanty fad
02:00:32 yeah
02:00:34 um it was a shanty it's called bones
02:00:36 in the ocean and I and I
02:00:38 put it on and I listen to it and I just
02:00:40 uh
02:00:42 and the and
02:00:44 that's no that's Wellerman
02:00:46 um bones in the ocean is different
02:00:48 bones in the ocean I didn't
02:00:50 realize this until later it's not
02:00:52 like a historical shanty it was made
02:00:54 in 2003
02:00:56 by a like modern folk band called
02:00:58 the longest johns
02:01:00 um which is fine it's still a good
02:01:02 song but I listened to it and I sobbed
02:01:04 and I cried and I bawled
02:01:06 I listened to it a bunch of times on repeat
02:01:08 and I cried tears
02:01:10 um
02:01:12 and it's been it's been stuck in my head
02:01:14 all week since then
02:01:16 uh it's a very sad
02:01:18 song but it's life affirming
02:01:20 it's a beautiful song I really like it
02:01:22 it's not very much it's pretty
02:01:24 not similar to
02:01:26 nightcore remix of come clean
02:01:28 by Hilary Duff it's a different genre
02:01:30 um
02:01:32 another song another song that I
02:01:34 have in my head and this one's very specific
02:01:36 and very weird it's the
02:01:38 do you know a channel called mandalore gaming
02:01:42 uh nope I don't think so
02:01:44 he does
02:01:46 video game reviews
02:01:48 I guess he did a
02:01:50 review of
02:01:52 mystery of the druids
02:01:54 which is the game have you heard of that
02:01:56 nope
02:01:58 it's it's famous mostly
02:02:00 for having a funny face
02:02:02 on the cover it's like a screaming
02:02:04 man
02:02:06 in like a hood
02:02:08 I might know that image
02:02:10 you've probably seen the mystery of the druids face
02:02:12 well he does a whole
02:02:14 like review of the game
02:02:16 and then at the end
02:02:18 he has like an original
02:02:20 song that he wrote
02:02:22 about the game with like
02:02:24 a CG like
02:02:26 movie of like the
02:02:28 characters like
02:02:30 running around and having like shenanigans
02:02:32 and it's really and the song is really
02:02:34 catchy and I've had the song
02:02:36 stuck in my head for a few days
02:02:38 it's the mystery of the druids
02:02:40 they all have
02:02:42 an attitude

02:04:40 delicious
02:04:42 thank you
02:04:44 thank you
02:04:46 everyone should
02:04:48 learn a thing or two
02:04:50 from this guy
02:04:52 next no
02:04:54 next voicemail is
02:04:56 is jeaness three two
02:04:58 one go
02:05:00 someone who really enjoyed
02:05:02 your undertale discussion from the early
02:05:04 pcp days
02:05:06 and someone who has recently finished
02:05:08 undertale I was wondering
02:05:10 what were your thoughts on azrael
02:05:12 dreamer as a character
02:05:14 thank you
02:05:16 um azrael is
02:05:18 real azrael is the kid right he's the kid
02:05:20 go yes um
02:05:22 I think
02:05:24 that azrael
02:05:26 I don't think
02:05:28 he's a great character
02:05:30 I think he's kind of just
02:05:32 no I think he's kind of
02:05:34 I think the story surrounding him
02:05:36 I think he's kind of just there
02:05:38 in the story because he needs to be
02:05:40 but he himself like
02:05:42 isn't really
02:05:44 much of a character he's a gut punch character
02:05:46 and I think his
02:05:48 as a character it's more
02:05:50 of like what you learn about
02:05:52 him than it is talking to him
02:05:54 uh
02:05:56 the whole like laboratory stuff
02:05:58 where you realize that
02:06:00 there was a fallen child that came
02:06:02 before you that was sort of
02:06:04 not you but it is you
02:06:06 or I can't remember the undertale very well
02:06:08 but I do remember really
02:06:10 enjoying azrael
02:06:12 uh boss design in like the
02:06:14 true pacifist ending
02:06:16 um because
02:06:18 it's like
02:06:20 really I don't know whether this was intentional
02:06:22 but it's like the sort of
02:06:24 like um
02:06:26 design that a kid would come up with
02:06:28 so like if azrael was
02:06:30 to choose his own form he'd be so
02:06:32 fucking badass with all these fucking
02:06:34 and like laser beams
02:06:36 and like the rainbow magic
02:06:38 stuff going all over the place
02:06:40 hyper ultra mega death laser
02:06:42 yeah and you
02:06:44 like that's sort of cute
02:06:46 yeah that's cute
02:06:48 but
02:06:50 but there's not much
02:06:52 there's not much more than the cuteness
02:06:54 he's a cute kid
02:06:56 and I guess he's been turned evil
02:06:58 by what is it is it the
02:07:00 fact that he's like trapped in like a time loop
02:07:02 he's become evil
02:07:04 yeah he's the sort
02:07:06 he is what you could become
02:07:08 if you do the genocide route but then he
02:07:10 is like overwhelmed by
02:07:12 how much more deadly you are
02:07:14 by when you do it
02:07:16 so you destroy him
02:07:18 and he's like oh shit
02:07:20 that's too much but in every other playthrough he's like
02:07:22 haha I know I can save
02:07:24 and load I know what you're doing
02:07:26 he's like he's he's he's
02:07:28 bigger than his britches
02:07:30 flowy is him right like flowy
02:07:32 is yes real okay yes
02:07:34 I don't feel like
02:07:36 okay I think what I don't like is that
02:07:38 flowy and him don't feel like the same
02:07:40 character even though they like canonically
02:07:42 are
02:07:44 like flowy doesn't seem
02:07:46 like a little kid
02:07:48 he just and he doesn't seem
02:07:50 like he would have these like
02:07:52 I don't know this you know
02:07:54 the high super ultra mega death power
02:07:56 stuff like that's
02:07:58 like as to as as real
02:08:00 as a kid and as real the boss
02:08:02 don't feel like I feel like that's
02:08:04 like was like maybe toby came up with that
02:08:06 at the last minute he's like oh what if flowy was
02:08:08 as real along but I feel like that was like an after
02:08:10 thought like after flowy was already written
02:08:12 no no I feel I feel
02:08:14 like this it's there is a dissonance
02:08:16 I kind of agree but I think the reason
02:08:18 of it is because you learn
02:08:20 about as reels past through
02:08:22 those like lot data logs
02:08:24 or videotapes or whatever you find
02:08:26 in the lab where you can like
02:08:28 hear him and like Kara talking
02:08:30 or
02:08:32 something and you get a sense he's like a really
02:08:34 little kid but then flowy
02:08:36 feels just like a cynical
02:08:40 edgier older
02:08:42 kid a little bit he's kind
02:08:44 of like
02:08:46 you could imagine him having a deep voice
02:08:50 but in the context of knowing
02:08:52 everything about as real and then seeing
02:08:54 flowy through all the different play throughs
02:08:56 I think it is more cohesive
02:08:58 a little bit
02:09:00 because it does feel like if a kid
02:09:02 was like you know how
02:09:04 kids can be cruel a kid
02:09:06 learns this power or is stuck
02:09:08 in a flower
02:09:10 and they play
02:09:12 this thing over and over again they can
02:09:14 kill people and then they can
02:09:16 go back and then they can kill them again
02:09:18 and over time I think that would make
02:09:20 anyone kind of evil
02:09:22 but flowy seems to
02:09:24 take a like a childish
02:09:26 glee in it and when things
02:09:28 get too real when you're the genocide
02:09:30 player he's like
02:09:34 he's playing tough
02:09:36 and he is tough because
02:09:38 of that boss thing but I don't know
02:09:40 the way that I'm coming off with this on the top
02:09:42 of my head because I haven't played in a while
02:09:44 I guess
02:09:46 I mean you can come up with reasons why
02:09:48 but just the way that he acts
02:09:50 when he's flowy and when he's
02:09:52 the flowy boss versus
02:09:54 when he's as real the
02:09:56 boss I understand that like
02:09:58 when he's kid as real he's like good
02:10:00 so like that's different so it's fine
02:10:02 that he acts different when he's kid as real
02:10:04 but like what is the difference
02:10:06 between when he's flower like
02:10:08 when he's flowy boss he's like
02:10:10 insane and crazy and when he's
02:10:12 like regular flowy he's kind of like
02:10:14 insane and unhinged but like in a sneaky
02:10:16 conniving way but then when he's
02:10:18 as real he's like
02:10:20 he's just like earnestly angry
02:10:22 anime villain like heartfelt
02:10:24 like kid who's who's been
02:10:26 turned dark but like has
02:10:28 like you know has like a
02:10:30 pure heart that you can reach if you try hard
02:10:32 and they don't feel like the same character at all
02:10:34 they don't act the same I guess I'd need
02:10:36 to replay it because I don't remember what
02:10:38 as real was like as a boss
02:10:40 yeah he's like
02:10:42 most of what I remember was sans
02:10:44 as a boss because I played that the most
02:10:46 yeah he when he's
02:10:48 he's like
02:10:50 when he's flowy he's like
02:10:52 sadistic and crazy but when he's
02:10:54 as real he doesn't he's like
02:10:56 he's like
02:10:58 he's like he says like don't leave me or stuff
02:11:00 and stuff and like
02:11:02 like how could like before you beat him
02:11:04 yeah I think like he's like
02:11:06 I'll kill you or something isn't it
02:11:08 like he's like mad that like
02:11:10 he thinks you'll abandon him or something
02:11:12 I feel like he says
02:11:14 something like that during the battle
02:11:16 I can't remember they
02:11:18 I don't know that's my thought is they don't feel
02:11:20 like the same they don't feel like the same
02:11:22 and I like that I don't like that they are the same
02:11:24 because when I think about them I don't
02:11:26 it I had to
02:11:28 ask to confirm because in my mind they don't
02:11:30 that doesn't feel real
02:11:32 it it is yeah like
02:11:34 I feel it as well a little bit
02:11:36 um but like
02:11:38 in terms of like what at
02:11:40 as real the as real
02:11:42 as as real boss and kid
02:11:44 I guess they feel about as fleshed out
02:11:46 as any other of the undertale characters
02:11:48 was just to say not a huge amount
02:11:50 other than they have a very
02:11:52 particular you know
02:11:54 character archetype that they
02:11:56 express very strongly
02:11:58 which is fine
02:12:00 uh
02:12:02 okay next voicemail is
02:12:04 Solaru
02:12:06 3 2 1 go
02:12:08 hey y'all
02:12:10 this might be a long voicemail
02:12:12 a few episodes ago Ben and Gid
02:12:14 talked about hiding and printing out their first
02:12:16 ludes in the other days on the internet
02:12:18 I wanted to share my story that I haven't told
02:12:20 anyone please
02:12:22 back in the mid 90s I would walk home from
02:12:24 grade school and junior high school in Long Island
02:12:26 I had no internet access yet
02:12:28 I was just thirsty all the time
02:12:30 as I walked home from school
02:12:32 there would be times when I would find business cards
02:12:34 on the sidewalk
02:12:36 these cards would have a topless model on them
02:12:38 on one side
02:12:40 for one 900 sex lines
02:12:42 on the other
02:12:44 I collected these cards wherever I could
02:12:46 yeah
02:12:48 I didn't have access to anything else
02:12:50 and I would just keep it close by
02:12:52 I needed a way to hide them
02:12:54 and knew my mom would search my room
02:12:56 constantly
02:12:58 so I managed to survive to tell you
02:13:00 the story since I did find a perfect hiding spot
02:13:02 under every first gen
02:13:04 nintendo console
02:13:06 there was a square dust cover
02:13:08 that would protect the accessories port
02:13:10 it's the one that they used
02:13:12 in Japan for the disk system but never came out
02:13:14 to America
02:13:16 I found that I could fold the cards and get them
02:13:18 stacked inside the tray
02:13:20 even though it was a great hiding spot
02:13:22 it came with paranoia every day
02:13:24 it was a great hiding spot
02:13:26 I was essentially
02:13:28 holding them on for a year
02:13:30 before I destroyed them as we moved out of the house
02:13:32 anyway that's my story
02:13:34 sorry
02:13:36 that's um
02:13:38 that's great
02:13:40 imagine the
02:13:42 with no internet access what are you gonna do
02:13:44 but you're a kid
02:13:46 but imagine
02:13:48 all you've got is these fucking
02:13:50 gentlemen's club business cards
02:13:52 on them
02:13:54 oh god
02:13:56 digerotype printed in
02:13:58 matte black and white
02:14:00 it's so much of it
02:14:02 is the imagination
02:14:04 you see it
02:14:06 and then you burn that image into your brain
02:14:08 and then you create something with it
02:14:10 in your brain
02:14:12 in your imagination
02:14:14 I feel like I've been in situations like that
02:14:16 where it's like
02:14:18 I don't have a lot
02:14:20 I mean you know what
02:14:22 there's moments where it's like
02:14:24 internet's out
02:14:26 oh no I can't look up porn
02:14:28 I have to think about it
02:14:30 I have to make it up
02:14:32 I have to remember what it looks like
02:14:34 like a barbarian
02:14:36 it doesn't always work
02:14:40 next voicemail is
02:14:42 fena2
02:14:44 3 2 1 go
02:14:46 ok
02:14:48 so the real problem with fena
02:14:50 alright the quality of his animation
02:14:52 the designs
02:14:54 the uncanniness
02:14:56 I can deal with that
02:14:58 I can copy the performer best anime in the world
02:15:00 I like rap boy genius
02:15:02 when I watch rap boy genius
02:15:04 that looks bad on purpose
02:15:06 I'm filled with happiness
02:15:08 when I watch fena I feel like
02:15:10 I'm sitting next to fucking george
02:15:12 from 6th grade math class
02:15:14 and he's like
02:15:16 this is
02:15:18 abel
02:15:20 he was killed by his brother
02:15:22 in the bible
02:15:24 and he thinks that genocide
02:15:26 and eugenics actually isn't that bad
02:15:28 and also
02:15:30 your dog doesn't really love you
02:15:32 it's just an
02:15:34 just a fucking animal
02:15:36 you idiot
02:15:38 fena just doesn't seem like a really good guy
02:15:40 he doesn't really seem like a nice person
02:15:42 he makes good things
02:15:44 I don't like him
02:15:46 that's interesting
02:15:48 I didn't really watch enough
02:15:50 I didn't really watch enough of the videos
02:15:52 to really
02:15:54 to get a sense of his
02:15:56 personality other than
02:15:58 that he reminds me of
02:16:00 that one german
02:16:02 asshole who kept asking me
02:16:04 to review his shitty
02:16:06 furry novel
02:16:08 yeah that's the one
02:16:10 I guess he was Austrian
02:16:12 I mean
02:16:14 it doesn't shock me
02:16:16 to think that maybe if I watched a bunch
02:16:18 of his content like his opinions
02:16:20 would strike me as those
02:16:22 of an asshole
02:16:24 that doesn't surprise me at all
02:16:26 I mean that's the sort of thing you would do
02:16:28 if you were an asshole is to make a youtube channel
02:16:30 is to be fena
02:16:34 you're right
02:16:36 you're absolutely correct about that
02:16:38 but
02:16:40 this poppy the performer
02:16:42 is from
02:16:44 a show called wolf circus
02:16:46 I get
02:16:48 I'm not really familiar with this one
02:16:50 but ratboy genius looks bad
02:16:52 on purpose
02:16:54 it's funny
02:16:56 the way it looks is part of why it's funny
02:16:58 so that's not
02:17:00 a good comparison
02:17:02 this is trying to look good
02:17:04 fena thinks this looks good
02:17:06 and he thinks he's done a good job
02:17:08 and the people that watch it
02:17:10 agree so like that's the problem
02:17:12 that's the problem
02:17:14 that I can't move past
02:17:16 there's a problem that I can't move past
02:17:18 I'm sure there's others
02:17:20 next voicemail is called
02:17:22 please god watch odd taxi
02:17:24 3, 2, 1, go
02:17:28 if you guys are still into anime
02:17:30 I'd like to hear your opinion on
02:17:32 odd taxi
02:17:34 because I think it's pretty good
02:17:36 and the fucking idiots
02:17:38 idiots on A are like
02:17:40 it's so boring
02:17:42 furry ship
02:17:44 when I don't think
02:17:46 I hate media, I hate people who consume media wrong
02:17:48 I hate them
02:17:50 but I hate them slightly more than fena
02:17:52 slightly
02:17:54 it's good, it's good
02:17:56 it's a crime drama about a walrus
02:17:58 who drives a taxi
02:18:00 there's a missing girl who we may or may not have kidnapped
02:18:02 there's a lot of drama
02:18:04 a lot of like intrigue
02:18:06 we're only on episode 3
02:18:08 and I made like a huge
02:18:10 sprawling chart of the characters
02:18:12 and their relationships
02:18:14 and yeah, it's really good
02:18:16 it's really good
02:18:18 I really hope that it doesn't like get left in the dust
02:18:20 this season
02:18:22 like I hope it becomes another mole car
02:18:24 it's really good
02:18:26 mole car? I don't know what that word mole car is
02:18:28 um
02:18:30 it looks like
02:18:32 it looks like a mole car
02:18:34 it looks like it could be fine
02:18:36 I don't know
02:18:38 oh wait, Nate
02:18:40 made a
02:18:42 made a video at some point
02:18:44 talking about a bunch of anime
02:18:46 from a season and mole car was a little
02:18:48 mole car
02:18:50 was a little something from it
02:18:52 I think
02:18:54 all one word
02:18:56 mole car anime
02:18:58 um
02:19:00 oh yeah, yeah, it's like a
02:19:02 it's like 3D
02:19:06 uh
02:19:08 a pui pui mole car
02:19:10 oh
02:19:12 is this the stop motion
02:19:14 thing with the plush hamsters
02:19:16 guinea pigs
02:19:18 guinea pigs
02:19:20 a pui pui mole car
02:19:22 it's a weird name
02:19:24 um
02:19:26 oh this is great
02:19:28 they don't even turn their wheels
02:19:30 they walk on their wheels
02:19:32 it's adorable
02:19:34 moru is japanese
02:19:36 for a cavey
02:19:38 which is the like species name
02:19:40 for a guinea pig
02:19:42 okay, that's funny
02:19:44 um
02:19:46 morumotto
02:19:48 um
02:19:50 so
02:19:52 I don't know, it looks fine
02:19:54 it looks like
02:19:56 you know it's I guess it's
02:19:58 there's a thing now of sometimes anime
02:20:00 just have animals
02:20:02 you know there was um
02:20:04 agretzko, that was big
02:20:06 fucking um, what's the
02:20:08 one with the rabbit and the wolf
02:20:10 uh
02:20:12 bee stars
02:20:14 bee stars, brand new animal
02:20:16 which I haven't seen, I've seen like
02:20:18 one episode of agretzko
02:20:20 it looks fine
02:20:22 it's good
02:20:24 bee stars, looks fine
02:20:26 brand new animal, don't know anything about it
02:20:28 I'm sure it's great, I'm sure it's fine
02:20:30 this one, it looks fine
02:20:32 it looks great
02:20:34 I'm not excited to watch it
02:20:36 I probably won't
02:20:38 I probably won't watch it
02:20:40 I don't want to watch a fucking show
02:20:42 I think about watching a show
02:20:44 and I just want to cry
02:20:46 because I'm like why would I do this to myself
02:20:48 why would I spend
02:20:51 fucking 10 hours
02:20:54 I don't care, I don't fucking
02:20:56 care about media
02:20:58 god, I'm so bored, I'm so bored
02:21:00 just thinking about watching a serialized television program
02:21:02 to speak to shows
02:21:04 you should watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer
02:21:08 yes, but definitely watch
02:21:10 Buffy the Vampire Slayer
02:21:14 god, that was a really really funny
02:21:16 episode recently, but of course
02:21:18 I will not talk about it ever
02:21:20 because I don't want to spoil anyone for anything
02:21:22 wait, what?
02:21:24 there was a what?
02:21:26 there was a really really funny episode
02:21:28 I guess it's not really a spoiler
02:21:30 but it's like
02:21:32 everyone bursts into song
02:21:34 and the entire episode is a musical
02:21:38 and they're like trying to figure out
02:21:40 what could be making them
02:21:42 like what sort of demon is causing them to all burst into song
02:21:44 and have like choreographed dance numbers all over town
02:21:46 and there's like
02:21:48 they're doing all these songs about stuff
02:21:50 and then in the background
02:21:52 sometimes you'll see like some random lady
02:21:54 doing like a
02:21:56 her own little musical number
02:21:58 with a parking ticket guy
02:22:00 he gave her a parking ticket and she's saying
02:22:02 why, oh why
02:22:04 can't you like just singing
02:22:06 about that as they walk around
02:22:08 that was funny, that was good
02:22:10 very nice, very good
02:22:12 um
02:22:14 I'm sorry
02:22:16 voice mailer
02:22:18 I'm sorry
02:22:20 your pitch just didn't land with me
02:22:22 your pitch just didn't land
02:22:24 I'm sure this isn't the reaction you wanted
02:22:26 I'm so sorry to disappoint you
02:22:28 I love you, I appreciate you
02:22:30 but I'm not gonna watch your fucking
02:22:32 bullshit anime
02:22:34 piece of shit
02:22:36 next voice mail
02:22:38 is called based joker 6
02:22:40 3, 2, 1, go
02:22:42 you know Batman
02:22:44 when you say peacock
02:22:46 well no one bats an eye
02:22:48 but when you say poop
02:22:50 yeah I knew it
02:22:52 well suddenly let's get that man off
02:22:54 of the mall PA system
02:22:58 you know it's a good bit
02:23:00 you know it's
02:23:02 you know it's a formula
02:23:04 it's a formula but you know
02:23:06 you shake it up
02:23:08 each time you twist it around a little bit
02:23:10 you do a new shape and you know it's evergreen
02:23:12 it's an evergreen formula
02:23:16 you know I'm reminded a little bit
02:23:18 because of that line
02:23:20 of the time
02:23:22 where double Batman was like a meme
02:23:24 we had
02:23:26 and like Radcon 1 or something
02:23:28 I like
02:23:30 I remember double Batman
02:23:34 I don't even remember like where that came
02:23:36 from I remember talking about it
02:23:38 at Bronycon
02:23:40 but that was like
02:23:42 wait did we
02:23:44 we might have been talking about it before
02:23:46 I remember it being like
02:23:48 in the car a lot
02:23:50 that was in the car at Bronycon
02:23:52 but that was before any Radcons
02:23:54 right?
02:23:56 yeah that was the Bronycon
02:23:58 that we went to
02:24:00 before we did the first Radcon
02:24:02 where we thought that would have been a better idea
02:24:04 yeah
02:24:06 so that's an old ass PCP meme
02:24:08 and I don't even remember where it came from
02:24:10 I really don't
02:24:12 do you?
02:24:14 I think it might be
02:24:16 footage in one of my
02:24:18 vlogs of the Bronycon
02:24:20 like the
02:24:22 I forgot what they were called
02:24:24 something to rather give and take
02:24:26 vlog
02:24:28 Bronycon part 2
02:24:30 I feel like there's a clip in there of that
02:24:32 because I remember having my camera out
02:24:34 I feel like there
02:24:36 but I think it was from before that
02:24:38 it was definitely
02:24:40 came up before that
02:24:42 there's a clip of it like
02:24:44 evolving in real time
02:24:46 because at that we joked about
02:24:48 Triple Joker
02:24:50 Triple Joker was only funny because
02:24:52 Double Batman was already a thing
02:24:56 I don't remember, I don't think I was around
02:24:58 for Double Batman
02:25:00 to come into
02:25:02 into existence
02:25:04 I can't remember, I have no idea
02:25:06 if any voicemailers remember
02:25:08 send us one
02:25:10 but not
02:25:12 imagine that like 30 people all send voicemails
02:25:14 that are all just like telling
02:25:16 I feel like the only people who would know
02:25:18 is Jesse and Trixie
02:25:20 it was from
02:25:22 the 30 voicemails that all just say
02:25:24 Double Batman came from that one episode
02:25:26 of the horse cast or whatever
02:25:28 oh yeah, maybe
02:25:30 like, comment, and subscribe
02:25:32 don't go back and listen to those
02:25:34 don't listen to anything I did before
02:25:36 like, comment, and subscribe if you remember
02:25:38 the horse cast
02:25:40 the progenitor
02:25:42 like, comment, subscribe
02:25:44 and
02:25:46 patron if you remember
02:25:48 the Norse cast
02:25:50 are the horse casts
02:25:52 still
02:25:54 around? I hope those are still
02:25:56 available somewhere
02:25:58 I mean, I haven't looked for them
02:26:00 it wouldn't shock me if like, wherever they were
02:26:02 had been like, deleted just because
02:26:04 like, entropy
02:26:06 but I hope not, I hope they're
02:26:08 somewhere
02:26:10 well, my horse cast live
02:26:12 is on
02:26:14 horse cast the second with Trixie
02:26:16 and Jesse is up
02:26:18 by just Google
02:26:20 they're all on Jesse's channel
02:26:26 on um
02:26:28 which channel, Endless Jest?
02:26:30 Manchild, Inc
02:26:32 oh, on Manchild, Inc
02:26:34 that was the one that used to be
02:26:36 used to be drowning in horses
02:26:38 why did he make a new channel?
02:26:42 for Manchild, Inc?
02:26:44 I think he just wanted to coast off
02:26:46 of stuff that was supposed to be like
02:26:48 corporate, like
02:26:50 no, no, no, no, Manchild, Inc was
02:26:52 no, but then he made a new channel for Endless Jest, right?
02:26:54 uh
02:26:56 no, drowning in footwear
02:26:58 became Endless Jest, didn't it?
02:27:00 oh, so Manchild, Inc
02:27:02 was a spin-off?
02:27:04 no, but
02:27:06 Manchild, yeah, Manchild, Inc was a spin-off
02:27:08 that I think he made
02:27:10 it was for like the plot line
02:27:12 that was supposed to
02:27:14 come around
02:27:16 after the horseshoe finale
02:27:18 there was like, there was like a
02:27:20 gonna be a plot line where he was like selling out
02:27:22 and that was like the gimmick
02:27:24 and that's what Manchild, Inc was about
02:27:26 something about a magic scepter
02:27:28 yes, the magic scepter, which I always
02:27:30 wanted, I always wanted to know
02:27:32 I always wanted to find out what was going to happen
02:27:34 and it never happened
02:27:36 what happened?
02:27:38 what was the wrestler villain?
02:27:40 oh, um
02:27:42 oh god, with the mirror mask
02:27:46 K-Fabe Commander?
02:27:48 K-Fabe Commander?
02:27:50 okay, yes
02:27:52 but that doesn't make any sense because
02:27:54 why is the, if the horse cast
02:27:56 was a new channel made for that
02:27:58 then why is the horse cast
02:28:00 wait a minute, was one of them drowning in
02:28:02 wait, what do you mean?
02:28:04 because
02:28:06 because Manchild, Inc
02:28:08 uh
02:28:10 was drowning in horseshoes
02:28:12 that was the pony channel
02:28:14 that was the pony channel
02:28:16 and the other one, right, he had a separate pony channel
02:28:18 that's right
02:28:20 drowning in footwear
02:28:22 that's why the horse cast is on it
02:28:24 okay, got it
02:28:26 drowning in footwear was like video game reviews
02:28:28 and then a few pony things
02:28:30 and then he made drowning in horseshoes
02:28:32 to be specifically the
02:28:34 pony review show
02:28:36 and then horseshoe finale
02:28:38 and everything brony related
02:28:40 I'm so stupid, it makes perfect sense
02:28:42 it makes perfect sense, okay
02:28:44 that became Manchild, Inc
02:28:46 where it became Endless Jess
02:28:48 yes, understood
02:28:50 um
02:28:52 okay, uh
02:28:54 I guess next voicemail
02:28:56 uh, is spiral senti
02:28:58 wait, you missed cross
02:29:00 oh, I did, yeah, cross what makes a bad voicemail
02:29:02 excuse me
02:29:04 cross what makes a bad voicemail
02:29:06 3, 2, 1, go
02:29:08 Ben was talking about how he didn't like the idea of live callers on the PCP
02:29:10 because they would inevitably
02:29:12 ramble on and on trying to make a point
02:29:14 I was gonna send in about that Johnny P guy
02:29:16 but I didn't want to come off as pretentious
02:29:18 being like, now here's what our friend did wrong
02:29:20 but fuck it, it's suddenly relevant again
02:29:22 now given how many voicemails there are
02:29:24 bad voicemails are the ones that act like they are
02:29:26 in the call with you guys taking a lot of time
02:29:28 to make their point and clearly not scripting it out
02:29:30 this approach to conversation works when you're actually
02:29:32 talking to somebody but not when it's a pre-recorded message
02:29:34 because the listener knows that you won't
02:29:36 pause so that they can ask a question
02:29:38 or make a report
02:29:40 this is one aspect of a bad voicemail
02:29:42 the silent moments of the PCP members listening
02:29:44 to people inefficiently make their point
02:29:46 or if they do interrupt the caller
02:29:48 they end up talking over the voicemail and confusing everyone
02:29:50 you can make a long voicemail
02:29:52 but it has to be dense enough with information
02:29:54 and well articulated enough that the listener
02:29:56 can understand it instantly
02:29:58 that way they don't feel uncomfortable with just absorbing
02:30:00 the information even if it's for an entire minute
02:30:02 obviously this isn't an absolute rule
02:30:04 but the general takeaway is
02:30:06 script your voicemails
02:30:08 I wasn't gonna say anything
02:30:10 but the autism voicemails before
02:30:12 could have been a lot shorter
02:30:14 there was a lot of um uhs in that
02:30:16 that could have been like half the length
02:30:18 uh but
02:30:20 yeah it's true
02:30:22 yeah this true
02:30:24 okay next one is spiral senchi
02:30:26 um
02:30:28 if this is the same spiral
02:30:30 by the way I mentioned that there was
02:30:32 a guy who was going through
02:30:34 all the old PCP
02:30:36 um episodes
02:30:38 doing a count on n-word tally for everyone
02:30:40 uh I believe
02:30:42 this is the guy spiral
02:30:44 uh uh uh
02:30:46 he's actually he decided to actually go back
02:30:48 and start over and like do a more
02:30:50 like a rigorous count
02:30:52 like you know tracking like hard
02:30:54 r's and stuff and like and other things too
02:30:56 he says I don't I'm not even sure
02:30:58 but he's he's he's
02:31:00 what a strange thing to do
02:31:02 he's doing god's work though
02:31:04 um three spiral senchi
02:31:06 three two one go
02:31:08 hey PCP
02:31:10 it's
02:31:12 right now it is
02:31:14 May 1st
02:31:16 1214
02:31:18 and about 14 minutes ago
02:31:20 I submitted
02:31:22 my comic for the kato anthology
02:31:24 yes
02:31:26 I didn't hear about it until like
02:31:28 a month in so I only had
02:31:30 well I had like a month to do it
02:31:32 and
02:31:34 my what I wanted to do ended up
02:31:36 being 12 about 12 pages
02:31:38 could have used more
02:31:40 not really good at comics yet
02:31:42 but I had never really done one before
02:31:44 so I don't know
02:31:46 I finished it and I submitted it
02:31:48 it's not very good
02:31:50 uh it's not
02:31:52 really complete either

02:32:04 Ben for
02:32:06 I guess retweeting it

02:32:10 but here's just thanks for bringing it
02:32:12 to bringing it to my attention
02:32:14 sure I don't know
02:32:16 if I ever would have

02:33:02 any of the other entries so I don't know like
02:33:04 what the general
02:33:06 quality level is at um
02:33:08 but you know apparently they've
02:33:10 they've got a bunch I don't know how many
02:33:12 they're choosing from for their
02:33:14 submission maybe it depends on page
02:33:16 count um
02:33:18 it's nice oh
02:33:20 it's nice that it seems like a bunch of people
02:33:22 got uh uh inspired
02:33:24 and uh did
02:33:26 something for this
02:33:28 thing I think it's
02:33:30 nice uh
02:33:32 they are gonna I guess they'll be starting
02:33:34 uh they'll be starting a kickstarter
02:33:36 soon to fund like the actual
02:33:38 printing of it so
02:33:40 um I will announce
02:33:42 that when it happens
02:33:44 um
02:33:46 yeah
02:33:48 okay
02:33:50 next voicemail is called Riley
02:33:52 is bad at his job
02:33:54 three two one go
02:33:56 hey guys can we
02:33:58 just talk about how Riley is like
02:34:00 the worst promoter ever
02:34:02 like it's
02:34:04 insane he calls himself a producer
02:34:06 but he acts more like a promoter
02:34:08 if you leave the slightest bit of criticism on the yin channel
02:34:10 he'll send you a whole fucking paragraph
02:34:12 about how fans are
02:34:14 entitled and don't like don't watch
02:34:16 uh first of all mother fucker
02:34:18 they're not watching that's why you're making
02:34:20 a fucking
02:34:22 1000 video news per video
02:34:24 to 3000
02:34:26 video uh
02:34:28 because nobody fucking wants to see this shit
02:34:30 uh fucking
02:34:32 procrastinators fans
02:34:34 would have been on board but you tried to
02:34:36 steal radcon and now they hate you
02:34:38 uh fucking
02:34:40 cantent ended
02:34:42 they probably would have just said creative differences
02:34:44 but he's like oh well he doesn't want to talk
02:34:46 about it we will first of all
02:34:48 who's we right
02:34:50 uh and then fucking
02:34:52 the dick show guys he could have fucking
02:34:54 Ralph was the easiest slam dunk ever
02:34:56 he managed to fucking fuck that up too
02:34:58 uh the guy was comparing himself
02:35:00 to the fucking joker and got clobbered by a girl
02:35:02 and but at least
02:35:04 he fucking called in so people hate Riley
02:35:06 now uh it's just fucking
02:35:08 amazing just how bad he is at his job
02:35:10 fucking Trixie had a whole platform
02:35:12 that was really successful for years
02:35:14 and in like
02:35:16 four months Riley's managed to completely
02:35:18 squander that goodwill your wife
02:35:20 did not want to work with him Ben Riley's an idiot
02:35:22 you're you're right
02:35:24 but I dis I will disagree
02:35:26 with one thing
02:35:28 which is that I Riley didn't Riley didn't
02:35:30 fuck it up uh Trixie
02:35:32 Trixie is fucking it up all on her own she is
02:35:34 going along with Riley's ideas
02:35:36 true but like
02:35:38 she's doing it all under her own power
02:35:40 and I don't think it's helpful
02:35:42 to say Riley
02:35:44 Riley is doing it Riley's the one
02:35:46 like Riley's the one like making her do it
02:35:48 he's not making her do anything
02:35:50 so let's not get that twisted
02:35:52 um
02:35:54 what did he say about the
02:35:56 call in somebody called in
02:35:58 Riley called into the dick show about this
02:36:00 I don't know I don't know
02:36:02 what happened with like the Ralph
02:36:04 I don't know and couldn't possibly care
02:36:06 about the the drama
02:36:08 goings on of that
02:36:10 the dick show the Riley the
02:36:12 yeah Ethan Ralph
02:36:14 yeah I don't know about that
02:36:16 they're just they're just whatever
02:36:18 they're whatever
02:36:20 the the thing about
02:36:22 the canton
02:36:24 it I want to say
02:36:26 it was
02:36:28 because like Nate didn't want to say anything
02:36:30 and all he did was make that
02:36:32 that tweet saying that like
02:36:34 we're going on hiatus
02:36:36 and then
02:36:38 literally never mentioned it again
02:36:40 in any capacity anywhere which is
02:36:42 honestly
02:36:44 weird and like bad in its own way
02:36:46 um but like
02:36:48 okay
02:36:50 the fact that like apparently like
02:36:52 um Trixie and Riley considered that
02:36:54 to be a like
02:36:56 a big PR problem
02:36:58 that they needed to fix
02:37:00 and then like their
02:37:02 solution to that was to make that
02:37:04 video where Trixie
02:37:06 introduces
02:37:08 the yig channel explains what it's
02:37:10 about and then
02:37:12 in the course of introducing
02:37:14 it to potential new
02:37:16 viewers explains that like
02:37:18 by the way these other people
02:37:20 have like refused to work with me
02:37:22 on the basis of what this channel is
02:37:24 which is not even like true
02:37:26 like I don't even believe that that was
02:37:28 really like I just don't believe
02:37:30 that Nate would just be like
02:37:32 your I don't like your channel
02:37:34 therefore we can't
02:37:36 work together it can't be that simple
02:37:38 and yet it makes it sound that way
02:37:40 which is like so much worse
02:37:42 than the actual truth
02:37:44 which is just that like your mobile
02:37:46 lifestyle doesn't allow us to continue
02:37:48 doing the show together it's
02:37:50 I don't know
02:37:52 it's really baffling on every level
02:37:54 in a way that
02:37:56 like the idea that Trixie
02:37:58 would be like this is what I'm doing
02:38:00 now and everybody hates it
02:38:02 honestly yeah that's the two things
02:38:04 you don't really want to say together
02:38:06 yeah there's a big section devoted
02:38:08 in the like what
02:38:10 Yeeg Studio is about video
02:38:12 that is like
02:38:14 I'm and by the way
02:38:16 Yeeg Studio I'm
02:38:18 breaking off relations with the PCP
02:38:20 because Ben doesn't
02:38:22 fucking like me anymore
02:38:24 and Nate won't work with me
02:38:26 on Kansan anymore and like
02:38:28 she says it's like because
02:38:30 she doesn't like
02:38:32 like the Yeeg
02:38:34 content paradigm like that's what she says
02:38:36 was Nate's problem with it
02:38:38 which is not I don't think that's true
02:38:40 but it's like
02:38:42 it sounds like she's saying
02:38:44 my channel is so fucking toxic that people
02:38:46 are burning their bridges with me and cutting ties
02:38:48 with me over it and like it's
02:38:50 it's worse it's worse
02:38:52 than the supposed like thing
02:38:54 that they were upset about which was Nate's
02:38:56 like non-statement about it
02:38:58 through content
02:39:00 I don't know
02:39:02 that's
02:39:04 so weird to me so fucking weird
02:39:06 so
02:39:08 I don't know
02:39:10 voicemailer I agree Riley is bad at his job
02:39:12 but other people are also
02:39:14 bad at their job
02:39:16 okay
02:39:18 sorry to go on an unhinged
02:39:20 rant like that
02:39:22 next voicemail is called
02:39:24 monkey more like dumb
02:39:26 3 2 1
02:39:28 go
02:39:30 in the comments
02:39:32 always clamoring
02:39:34 for monkey
02:39:36 they are so great about him
02:39:38 he's pretty average you know
02:39:40 kinda
02:39:42 kinda lame
02:39:44 got him
02:39:46 um
02:39:48 yeah I don't really get it got him
02:39:50 I don't really get
02:39:52 the commenters in particular
02:39:54 the commenters in you think so
02:39:56 yeah
02:39:58 the fact that monkey was kicked off the show
02:40:00 a return
02:40:02 is like what they want
02:40:04 they don't care necessarily about monkey
02:40:06 being on the podcast
02:40:10 they just want the spectacle of like
02:40:12 it might even just be like
02:40:14 an anti-trixie thing as well
02:40:16 cause like Trixie had a beef with monkey
02:40:18 and monkey's back
02:40:20 and it's like haha
02:40:22 I think that's quite a lot of the reason
02:40:24 why people actually want to see it
02:40:28 okay that makes sense
02:40:30 I mean
02:40:32 yeah
02:40:34 yeah okay
02:40:36 I guess that's it
02:40:38 uh you're right

02:56:24 walkers haunting masterpiece video oh sure yeah this was one of the ones someone
02:56:31 linked me it was one of the couple that I saw last week that I liked it's a good
02:56:37 video um I mean I I don't know what I have to talk to him about other than Doug
02:56:46 Walker which I don't really have that much to say about he's only got 470
02:56:52 followers on Twitter so you know he's I mean he's I'm sure he might come on if
02:56:58 invited but I don't know to what end you know to what end what's really the point
02:57:07 of anything friendship yeah fun time enough fun conversation yeah shut the
02:57:14 fuck up next voicemail is called let's fire Riley three two one go if there's
02:57:22 anybody out there in the audience who hates Riley as much as I do the Dick
02:57:27 Masterson is thrown down the gauntlet if you can make $30,000 a month on
02:57:32 patreon then he will fire Riley on the spot now I don't know how much of an
02:57:36 overlap there is between dick show fans of procrastinators fans but I am one of
02:57:41 you and I know that others exist so this is a call to arms anyone who'd be
02:57:47 interested throw in a couple of bucks patreon.com slash the dick show let's
02:57:52 get this little creep gone once and for all no you understand you misunderstand you
02:57:56 misunderstand you go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators podcast if then if
02:58:01 the pro make 30,000 a month we will use a bullet to fire at Riley if we if we can
02:58:10 get back up over a thousand a month we will also fire Riley and it's much
02:58:16 cheaper it's much cheaper because we don't need to do anything because we're
02:58:19 already doing it but we'll make it official I I'm sorry if this bursts
02:58:27 your bubble mr. voicemailer but I do not like Dick Masterson I do not want his
02:58:32 patreon to reach 30k so I would consider that if his patreon reach 30k and
02:58:39 Riley were fired I would consider that to be a lateral move at best so no I like
02:58:49 your gusto though I like your spirit I like that you're making moves I don't
02:58:53 necessarily approve all the moves that you're making but I am but I like that
02:58:57 you are making moves I also think it's kind of a stupid like obvious like like
02:59:04 chump move to pledge to the dick Masterson patron cuz like if he wanted to if
02:59:10 Riley was actually a problem to dick he could fire him at any point yeah like
02:59:17 like if if it's it's it's clearly just like milking stupid fans because of drama
02:59:24 like I mean people will hate Riley give me money haha like it's so like there's
02:59:31 nothing there's not I mean I'm sure I mean I'm sure it doesn't I'm sure it
02:59:35 didn't work I'm sure it didn't actually I'm sure nobody actually was like yes
02:59:38 I'll donate cuz I hate right I mean nobody cares well nobody cares maybe so
02:59:42 and also people care I don't think I don't think I feel like Riley's more of a
02:59:47 figure in that crowd as me I don't think so I mean I'm not even convinced that
02:59:53 I'm not even convinced that he even works for dick I think dick paid him like
02:59:58 for once I don't think he actually does anything I think it's just a meme I
03:00:04 think it's just a meme that Riley just leans into because it's like his his
03:00:09 his keys to the lever of power or so he or so he thinks it's all he's got going
03:00:14 on he doesn't seem to do anything is what I'm saying and I don't know maybe
03:00:19 I'm wrong but it doesn't look like he does anything so I don't I mean that and
03:00:24 also I just don't believe that dick would keep his word like if assuming I'm
03:00:31 wrong and Riley does do anything at all for dick if dick does if dick does want
03:00:39 him around for some reason I don't think he would actually do it like I don't
03:00:44 think he would actually get rid of him even if we hit that goal but so so
03:00:51 there's that one it wouldn't even it wouldn't even accomplish the thing that
03:00:55 you think it would accomplish to it wouldn't even be a net gain because you
03:00:58 would have to do something bad i.e. raising dick master since patreon numbers
03:01:02 in order to accomplish it three I don't know yeah we need we need the money more
03:01:08 we're dying here we're dying we're literally dying yeah I'm wondering literally
03:01:14 dying it's true it's true see I would I've been I've been to the I can milk my
03:01:20 illness for money for cash if you want right if you want to help pay for Gibbs
03:01:27 oncoming massive medical bills and pretend you live in America please yeah
03:01:34 I I've I've recently moved to America right now this second donate to the
03:01:44 only way the only way to help get Gibb through this trying time is to donate to
03:01:49 patreon.com slash the Ben Sayeders yes that's right okay okay next voicemail is
03:02:00 called an an amendation on previous statements in hopes of exonerating three
03:02:07 to one go quick correction on the pro one on spamming the Ben discord the
03:02:15 members of the pro one on didn't he say alternative a coin so cals poor can you
03:02:20 get that was me the doing this the pro on ban it me also banner a you going to
03:02:27 continue making the asked kappa desk I understood about half of that yeah thanks
03:02:37 first spamming my just thanks for not spamming my discord anymore maybe one of
03:02:44 these days I will open the invites back up but not today next one is called who
03:02:50 is the best Tom three two one go hey PCP this is like my fifth or sixth time
03:02:58 recording this and it's like 5 a.m. specifically 510 and I had a question for
03:03:03 you guys where is the best Tommy Oliver OC when he when he first viewed on the
03:03:08 scene is probably curious I didn't think he looked that good he was just kind of
03:03:11 dark blue with a door you know the mullet he had the OC look kind of bland but
03:03:16 is actually coming to his own with tall tales nice red feather a nice unique
03:03:22 art style that really made him stand out from the crowd but then he kind of went
03:03:27 all lanky got all skinny long like an actual horse kind of interesting but I
03:03:32 think some people would find it weird and then there was the zombie version
03:03:35 that was used in some of analysis videos I don't I don't know if Tom had that
03:03:37 one that one's not even cannon count or even knew it existed or whether she'd
03:03:42 even count but then there's like his 2d like avatar of him which I think looks
03:03:46 pretty good and you know I was just wondering what you guys thought was the
03:03:51 best I think I personally towards the second one personally and I just
03:03:55 realized something just Tom have a 3d version of himself I mean he's a 3d guy
03:03:59 now so it would make sense and you're right you know you're right you should
03:04:03 make it you should make a 3d viewer of him then please please release it's on
03:04:07 which you want to I'm begging you come on come on you heard me say you heard me
03:04:11 say that it's coming it's coming after phantom's revenge this that was like a
03:04:17 keystone in what I wanted to do before release it we're getting there um yes
03:04:23 one should definitely make a 3d avatar that just seems obvious now that you say
03:04:27 it yes and I and my favorite so far is the the the classic the red beret
03:04:35 brony curious yeah original design I would have to be it stood out from all
03:04:41 the other brony analysis people and it was just really solid it just looks
03:04:46 great I would I would have to say I would have to say that that's the most
03:04:51 iconic was the yeah the beret tall tales not not the really tall one
03:04:57 cuz like you know that one was unique but it was kind of weird looking was that
03:05:00 drawn by someone else I feel like it may have been I don't think so I mean I
03:05:04 could be wrong I assume Tom drew it time to go to the brony analysis week I did
03:05:10 like find out I did like remember the you remember the avatar before the
03:05:15 beret right like when yeah with it way out of fedora with the fedora I mean I
03:05:21 liked that one and I liked that the horn like like pokes through the fedora I
03:05:26 thought that was pretty good the beret is more iconic I like that his design
03:05:31 was it looked oh it was drawn by him yeah it looks similar enough to like an
03:05:36 on-model like show accurate but it's it's different enough that you can tell
03:05:40 that it's it's drawn by him it's got a couple like the it's got like the kind
03:05:45 of the hair coming off the ears I think is a little different it's got yeah
03:05:53 honestly when I when I learned that he had the hat in real life like I at a
03:06:00 certain point the hat became an ironic statement but I believe that at some
03:06:04 point the hat was worn unironically which I gotta admit did poison the well
03:06:09 did poison the hat a little bit for me but you know once once it was moved into
03:06:14 since strictly ironic territory then I the healing could begin and in hindsight
03:06:20 yeah I would say that's the most iconic Tom Oliver OC is the beret wearing tall
03:06:24 tails the beret where it's just like the it's cute enough it's fluffy enough but
03:06:31 not too fluffy it's just that the proportions are very good it's like a
03:06:34 it's like a you know could fit in a in a sphere very nicely why that's part of a
03:06:42 good character design I feel like it is is that a hallmark of good character
03:06:47 well it's it's it's good for for like cuteness I mean like tall tails is cool
03:06:54 but he's too tall and thin he feels like he's not sturdy enough with their all
03:06:59 they're all tall guy this guy you they're all told I mean like tall as in like
03:07:04 little physical tall tall tails yeah the final iteration yes yeah yeah like this
03:07:10 one feels like you could make a 3d model of it and like print it out and then
03:07:15 have it like a little pony true I want one I want one yeah okay so you know what
03:07:26 I'm looking it looks even better than I remember it looks even better than I
03:07:29 remember it's crisp it looks great it's great honestly I'm like I'm feeling I'm
03:07:34 feeling it I'm feeling the nostalgia I'm feeling like that was those were the
03:07:38 days of this this particular pony you see hey you know what I'm more sure than
03:07:44 ever definitely this one look at the shading it's great yeah it is just it's
03:07:51 great what happened huh what happened three dimensions this was all it was all
03:07:56 all downhill from here yeah then the next voicemail comes with an image and I
03:08:05 must oh I must give I must give a content warning I must give a content
03:08:10 warning avert your eyes children I looking at it I'm looking yeah it is
03:08:15 sexual Eleazar and new and lewd in nature it's nude and lewd blurt Eleazar
03:08:21 pixelate it please please spare our young audience and let's listen to the
03:08:28 voicemail this is from oblivion fall three two one go I'm sure you're in the
03:08:33 middle of recording a podcast episode right now I'm just currently listening
03:08:38 to the previous one pretty interesting conversation about bail jpe and tiki
03:08:43 wiki mickey now lovely character she is then you mentioned several times this
03:08:49 word Maori I believe you were trying to pronounce Maori or Maori which is the
03:08:55 sorry indigenous New Zealand population I've only got like a little bit of Maori
03:09:00 on me so I can't you know really comment on this that much ctole is I believe
03:09:06 full Maori for the most part but again they grow up in Australia so I don't
03:09:11 know to what extent ctole is familiar with this stuff yeah so tiki is like
03:09:15 this like these wooden statues that you see around shrines and stuff they tend
03:09:20 to look very like actually like very different from what's in bail jpe like
03:09:24 completely different a lot more like circular patterns spirals and swirls and
03:09:30 they actually look kind of cool sometimes it depends on the one you look at if
03:09:33 you I guess you could see it if you google a Maori like wood carving or wood
03:09:37 statue so I know I just thought that was like an interesting thing kind of kind
03:09:42 of like Gibbs perspective she's very based based Gibb by the way I'm drawing
03:09:48 like a fat pair of titties as I record this I'm gonna leave a link in the
03:09:52 voicemail it's nsfgo you can't show it on the podcast but just I want to hear
03:09:56 your reaction if this fucking look well you heard you heard you heard our
03:10:01 reaction you heard what we think and yeah yeah oblivion fall at some point I
03:10:12 guess it's been a while since they've started but they just decided to start
03:10:17 drawing porn and like huge tits and stuff like for my now just just to do it
03:10:26 I don't know whether they've sold anything necessarily but it's just like
03:10:30 they enjoy the idea they're in the big booby mummy milkers server nice that's
03:10:35 us that's still a thing it's it's very quiet haven't heard much about that
03:10:39 lately but yeah I mean it's it's you know people people are occasionally things
03:10:44 they're they're making nice it's but people I don't think the bots working
03:10:48 that's sort of a lot of nothing to do but yeah oblivion fall is like just
03:10:55 immediately really good and it's been getting better and it's been annoying me
03:10:59 how good they are at drawing that sort of that the pornography I wanted to draw
03:11:05 the pornography but I can't do it it's too hard I need to learn things and
03:11:09 that's difficult these nipples but yeah I'm sorry I gotta say the nipples are too
03:11:15 big they're like I mean they do they do like the like the entire front of the
03:11:21 breast is nipple and I that's I don't like it I don't like that that's really
03:11:26 that's that's really actually turning me off quite a bit the more I look at it I'm
03:11:30 like God oh you know I can the the hair right breast nipples seems a lot bigger
03:11:42 than the the other one sorry that might just be the angle because like you
03:11:52 know the one you're kind of seeing from a more top-down angle versus the other
03:11:56 one you're kind of seeing from the side but I see what you mean yeah I see what
03:12:00 you mean like it could be it could be painful does draw really no no that
03:12:05 would make sense and be fine if the nipple is actually like wider than it
03:12:09 is tall but if it if they're supposed to be a perfect circle I think you're
03:12:14 right and the proportions are a little different yeah yeah yeah I believe in
03:12:21 full does draw like hyper large sex hyper large sex I hyper large sex that's
03:12:31 that's what they call it Craig Craig you fucker he left the truck didn't want to
03:12:37 left the call he was offended your piece of shit can't find the Craig I can't
03:12:45 believe Craig is such a virgin perma virgin nerd let's see can I get it can
03:12:55 I get him back in here no he's not listening if you want me to start
03:13:04 recording Craig is a volso I've been unexpectedly disconnected if you want
03:13:09 me to stop please okay this is like this is not even on topic right now but I
03:13:16 want to fuck with Craig I just want can I tell him to leave and then rejoin yes
03:13:24 but I didn't okay okay well whatever um you got anything to say about the tiki
03:13:34 thing yeah I'm not sure that I haven't seen many comments talking about it like
03:13:40 what like necessarily having like an opinion I think there was that one
03:13:44 commenter said hey I'm black and I don't care yeah so I was like yeah okay
03:13:50 problem solved I yeah it's not really problem solved but like it's something I
03:13:56 I don't really know exactly what to do yet yeah obviously a redesign is in order
03:14:02 I'm just trying to figure out how to do it what if you know what I thought about
03:14:08 I thought about this this week and like I had a thought and I don't want to speak
03:14:13 on it as though I have like any say in like what the character is or does right
03:14:20 so that's that's not what I'm trying to do but I had a thought that was just like
03:14:24 a what if and it was like I don't know this is kind of stupid don't take this
03:14:30 too seriously don't take this too seriously it was just a funny what what
03:14:36 if what if the character of tiki had a revelation that they were like huh you
03:14:42 know I didn't even know anything about Maori Islander culture I just made this
03:14:47 mask because I thought that's what a witch doctor should look like but now I
03:14:51 realized that this was like an insensitive racial caricature and then
03:14:55 she just takes the mask off and it's like I'm still gonna make potions and
03:14:59 stuff because that's what I do but I'm not gonna wear this mask anymore because
03:15:04 like I don't think it's appropriate that would be funny it's a little it's a
03:15:10 little like too like obvious self-insert meta humor sort of thing sure yeah
03:15:19 wouldn't it wouldn't be it wouldn't be canon I'm not saying whatever the
03:15:22 character I'm not I'm not saying but I like it it's funny I'm not saying you
03:15:26 should do that but I thought about that and I was like you know I feel like that
03:15:29 would that would be a solution that is like acknowledging like why the
03:15:35 character changes it but also not doing like a sweep under the rug like let's
03:15:40 just pretend she never looked like that sort of thing all right maybe I guess
03:15:46 it sort of opens again not my not my question not my character I don't have
03:15:52 anything about it yeah that the reason I would not do it that way is because it
03:15:57 opens up the idea that blackface and like indigenous cultures and being
03:16:07 offended from those things would all exist in this universe just in the
03:16:13 exactly the same way that they would exist in our universe and it's not
03:16:17 exactly what I want to go for but you know yeah that would sort of imply yeah
03:16:23 that would sort of imply that like yeah maybe not necessarily that it takes it
03:16:30 would sort of imply that it takes place in our world which like if it doesn't
03:16:35 then like it doesn't it doesn't make any sense yeah okay that's totally fair that
03:16:39 makes sense um LeMau it's it's I'm imagining her like I'm imagining she
03:16:48 takes the mask off and like she's got kind of like a long neck right and like
03:16:54 sort of and like the math I'm imagining that without the mask on she's got sort
03:16:59 of like a long neck in her head is like pretty like just sort of like small and
03:17:04 like a sphere it's kind of like a ball on the end wait a minute let me let me
03:17:10 really quickly like doodle what I what I think like the shape of her head would
03:17:15 be without wait this will take me two seconds get my stylist it's kind of
03:17:23 like here's her shoulder here's her other shoulder here's her kind of like
03:17:28 skinny neck
03:17:36 yeah that's perfect let me grab that with my little tool here and bam
03:17:48 like without the mask that's the shape of her head and it just and like and like
03:17:52 the mask is like thick wood and the mask has sort of like a perfectly
03:17:56 spherical like indentation in the back of it and her spherical head just kind of
03:18:00 like sort of sticks into the spherical indent like a ball joint not canon not
03:18:08 canon like a little snap Lego thing yes yes precisely food fan theories fan
03:18:19 that's just a theory a fan theory a bail theory
03:18:26 bail jpeh that is
03:18:29 I was thinking about like bail jpeh and like the the the fact that the story
03:18:33 continues but it wouldn't be called bail jpeh again because bail jpeh is just a
03:18:37 it's a silly play on jailbreak yeah and it's also barely makes sense bale
03:18:46 does not have anything to do with the comic and jpeh kind of does kind of
03:18:51 kind of it's jpeh but it's not bail related there's no bailary no no so
03:18:59 like if there was like an extended comic that you know one piece it's about one
03:19:05 piece and everything in the comic will eventually lead to one piece I need to
03:19:10 think of a name for whatever my big comic is that include like carries on the
03:19:14 story oh like the name for the and like the name for like the extended
03:19:20 universe kind of the ongoing series the ongoing series the main thing that you
03:19:28 know the thing leads into the pumpkin like bail jpeh would be the wanted to
03:19:33 whatever the one piece will eventually be oh I get it I get it hmm are you are
03:19:41 you saying that like you you plan to do like a like a is that your plan like make
03:19:47 a more realized series about it yeah I like the characters that I make but I'm
03:19:55 I'm like you know bail jpeh was you know I made it all up and then I went around
03:20:03 afterwards thinking like okay well all these things I introduce what how could
03:20:07 they fit into a world that I could build and then I did all that but nobody
03:20:12 knows anything about it and that was the plan going forward is to do that in
03:20:18 some form but I don't have a name for it yet it's the only thing is like oh it's
03:20:23 punks in it maybe could be punk related but she's not the main character is she
03:20:27 oh I don't know is she not the main character um that's also a thing I'm
03:20:36 not in I'm not even sure there's so many things I want to do and it's so
03:20:39 complicated hard to talk about yeah maybe I should make it more simple maybe
03:20:46 maybe you should what maybe I should make it more simple and just decide that
03:20:50 there is a main character and it is about them and their journey and these
03:20:54 other characters I have are secondary because at the moment I have like a lot
03:20:58 of secondary characters that will all meet together in one big thing but it
03:21:02 kind of does it it requires a protagonist and like a main one otherwise
03:21:07 it's hard to link everything together punk would be it probably I mean that's
03:21:15 just what I assumed that's just what I assumed but yeah I don't know names are
03:21:21 hard and so is basically everything when it comes to nailing down nailing down
03:21:29 the details it's like it's like painful right you know what I mean because like
03:21:34 when you're coming up with a story and you're when you finally nail down the
03:21:37 details of what it is you are throwing away like all the other things that
03:21:43 could have been everything things yeah and sometimes it's like oh that would
03:21:48 have been cool but I want to do this and it always comes at the expense of
03:21:52 something else and it's like it's hard it makes it very hard for me it takes
03:21:56 takes me a long time sometimes the only takes me a long time sometimes and
03:22:01 like sometimes the only way that I can be sure that a thing that I want to make
03:22:05 is definitely the thing I want to make is just because I realize I've been
03:22:09 thinking about this thing for a long long time and it has the fact that I keep
03:22:13 thinking about it means that I must want to make it and so that's what I'm
03:22:18 gonna do that's what that's what slime and pun not slime and punishment that's
03:22:23 what fandoms revenge was is I just kept picturing like what if it ended with a
03:22:27 video game and I kept picturing what it would look like and it always looked the
03:22:32 same way in my head and I was like well I guess I got to make a game that looks
03:22:36 like that and I did partially yeah I'm excited to see that the final thing
03:22:46 when the when the final thing comes out I definitely will not give up even if it
03:22:50 is difficult I have shit I have I have some the demo has no story to it at all
03:22:59 but I have a few big ideas I have a few big like story ideas that I'm like really
03:23:06 excited about I'm actually more excited about like what I want to present
03:23:10 story-wise in it than I am about the like the mechanics itself so like I
03:23:15 consider what's there right now to not even be like the most important part
03:23:19 that's like that's just sort of like okay I guess I had to make it an actual
03:23:24 game so you know that part's done now on to like the real work which is like
03:23:28 making the cutscenes which I don't know how to do making like I talked about how
03:23:34 hard and complicated it is just to make like one character do one animation I
03:23:39 feel like making a cutscene is going to be like a bunch of that plus a bunch of
03:23:45 like adding in like moments where like you know you gotta I gotta mix that with
03:23:51 like dialogue and like you know having the functions that like switch between
03:23:55 like progressing dialogue and progressing like character and it's gonna
03:23:58 take a lot of grunt work and I haven't really worked out how it works yet but
03:24:04 whatever I figured out everything else I'll figure it out too and boy I'm it's
03:24:13 very ambitious it's maybe a little too ambitious what I want to show but we'll
03:24:18 see we'll see yeah I wonder I mean game maker is very specific I don't know like
03:24:28 the way in Psycholonial's Hussie just has videos or like flashes probably the
03:24:34 play that would be like a rendered cutscene material right yeah rendered
03:24:41 video like it is not rendered in-game or anything so like if there's a way to
03:24:45 like play a video file in game maker I'm envisioning probably make it I was
03:24:54 considering maybe having cutscenes be presented as like a series of images like
03:24:59 comic panels I might I might do some of that but I would like it if the majority
03:25:05 of it was like it was like the actual sprites kind of like walking around in
03:25:11 the room like they're in-game sprites walking around you know gesturing at
03:25:16 each other having the dialogue boxes pop up as they talk to each other having
03:25:21 little like custom animations go when like when they do things like that's how
03:25:25 I would want to present most of it oh like like a little camera that's like
03:25:30 floating around and and looking at things and no you don't have control I
03:25:35 mean like I mean like you know like you know around in the no that's not what I
03:25:42 mean what I mean is like it's it looks like like you're playing the game like
03:25:46 you know at the very beginning you know Phantom he runs down the ramp and then
03:25:51 he stops and he stands there and then there's little dialogue box and then he
03:25:54 runs like out yeah imagine like imagine that but like with more going on like
03:26:00 maybe like in between lines like he walks around or he like he maybe does a
03:26:04 gesture or maybe there's another character who's like doing the same thing
03:26:08 talking back to him and like they have a back and forth and like they they
03:26:12 enter like they move and they interact and they have they animate with each other
03:26:15 to display some action that's what I'm talking about like it looks like it's
03:26:20 like in-game but if you I feel like this is a concept that there must be a
03:26:27 simple way to describe but I'm just like floundering and finding really
03:26:30 complicated ways to describe it it's like in like in game like gameplay in-game
03:26:36 rendered as opposed to a pre-rendered cutscene I don't know I just want to have
03:26:40 the fucking sprites move around and they go whoa that's it easy easy peasy you
03:26:48 there the they move around as if in-game yes yes like like an undertale cutscene
03:26:58 kind of exact yes I should have just said that I should have just said like an
03:27:03 undertale yes that's what I'm talking about you know like a video game like a
03:27:09 JRPG yeah like that lol I'm sorry I took so long to express that very simple idea
03:27:19 um oh my god okay we're at three and a half hours lamal fuck you Eleazar how
03:27:31 does it keep happening I don't know it's I just have I'm just so filled with I'm
03:27:37 just a full of ideas I'm just so filled with I'm not I'm just filled with
03:27:42 anything brimming brimming with creative potential that just has to flow out of
03:27:46 me and create content create content to be consumed be fed into the algorithm
03:27:52 disgusting it's delicious but I guess I guess we should wrap up if you're if
03:28:00 you're ready to call it a day yes yes okay well that's it then spend as a
