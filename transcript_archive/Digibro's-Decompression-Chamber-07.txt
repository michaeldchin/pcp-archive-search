00:00:00 Oh my god, I actually did it.
00:00:19 I actually finished all of the projects that I was working on in the last couple of weeks,
00:00:27 the last month probably.
00:00:29 Man, I gotta tell ya, first of all I have to apologize, cause I feel partially responsible
00:00:36 for the fact that there hasn't been any new PCP this week, and how they've been kind
00:00:42 of irregular lately, that there's been more of all the side projects than the main ones.
00:00:47 No fault of Nate who's been trying to organize PCPs all the time, the rest of us are always
00:00:54 busy, and Ben's been doing his Pokemon Sun playthrough, and he's been busy working on
00:01:04 his comic, so that's been keeping him occupied a lot.
00:01:08 Davoo has been working really hard on my videos, I gave him a lot of assignments, it took him
00:01:14 a straight week to finish the video on the one we just did, the subverting Shonen Trove's
00:01:21 video, and I don't know, Jesse's been, I guess, just moping around somewhere, I haven't
00:01:29 seen a lot of him in the last month and a half or so, but as for me, I usually see Nate's
00:01:38 calls to action, and I'm just like, I am busy working on all this other shit.
00:01:42 I gave myself too much work, I gave myself too many projects, too many ongoing projects,
00:01:48 where I keep having, like, I'll be thinking, alright, today I'm gonna edit this video,
00:01:55 but then I'll remember, oh yeah, today's PCP day, or today is Pub Crawl Day, or today
00:02:00 is Day I Get Called Into Random Other Podcast, I did a podcast with Mumki, just like over
00:02:07 a week ago, I did the Wave Motion Cannon Podcast that still isn't out, I think it's gonna come
00:02:13 out soon, I hope it comes out soon, because I'm giving it a shout out in my next video.
00:02:20 So yeah, there's just a lot of stuff that keeps pulling my attention aside, and then
00:02:25 I keep giving myself these really big projects, and then having them stacked on top of all
00:02:29 this other shit, and I was also saving a lot of stuff up, so like, the Let's Plays, you
00:02:34 know, I stocked up the entire Bomberman and the entire Wario Land 4 Let's Play, like,
00:02:40 I didn't release any of it until both of them were pretty much completed, so that was like
00:02:44 16 videos that were just sitting on my computer until I had time to edit all of them, upload
00:02:49 them all, you know, schedule them all, give them all the information, which is a process
00:02:54 in itself, I had these fucking, god, I, so the two big ones that were really holding
00:03:04 me, that were like weighing down on me, is the co-heating Cambria video and my audio
00:03:09 book of my novel that I wrote six years ago, both of these are pretty big projects that
00:03:14 I kinda jumped on while the inspiration was there, and then quickly realized they were
00:03:19 much too big.
00:03:20 Now, I'm gonna tell you about the best feeling in the world, and the worst feeling in the
00:03:23 world, the best feeling in the world is being way ahead of yourself, the best feeling in
00:03:29 the world is when I have six completed videos waiting to be uploaded, that feels great.
00:03:37 When there's six videos that are already uploaded to which, like, okay, let's say the Let's
00:03:43 Place, right, it feels great to know that in December, there will be a Let's Play video
00:03:49 every month, I already scheduled a whole month worth of Let's Plays, you know, all of December,
00:03:54 the exact length of December, because both Bomberman and Wario were 16 episodes apiece,
00:03:59 both their final episode will come out on the 31st, so every day of December has a Let's
00:04:05 Play coming out, all of those videos are fully uploaded, fully scheduled, they have all their
00:04:09 information in place and the files have been moved to my external hard drive, they're not
00:04:15 even on my computer anymore, those videos are fucking done, that feels great, that's
00:04:21 being ahead of yourself.
00:04:24 The worst feeling in the world is having unfinished videos sitting around on the desktop and knowing
00:04:32 that I haven't done them yet, and I have this, I like to have only one column of things on
00:04:40 my desktop, I have four folders that are below my wrist, you know, there's the computer,
00:04:45 the computer icon, the main user folder, the DigiBro folder, the recycling bin, and
00:04:52 there's four folders under that, the first one is a music folder for all the music projects
00:04:58 that I'm working on, the second one is just a general video, it's called NNB which stood
00:05:05 for Non Non Biori, because I made the folder when I started up the sitting around watching
00:05:10 series with Non Non Biori, so whenever I take files off of my camera, I throw them into
00:05:15 that folder, and then you know, the files stay in there until those videos are done
00:05:18 being edited, then I remove the files from the folder, then there is the podcasts folder
00:05:24 where I hold anything for this channel pretty much, stays in that folder, and then finally
00:05:31 there is the let's play folder which is new, I didn't have one in the old days, but I created
00:05:36 one because of the let's plays I was doing with both DeVue and Victor, these four folders,
00:05:42 the best state for them to be in is empty, now a couple of them have materials, like
00:05:47 for instance the NNB folder has all of the comments that I use for the board of second
00:05:52 chances videos, or the podcasts one has the thumbnail and the background photoshop documents
00:05:59 for the procrastinators videos, and the music one just has a shit ton of errant music files
00:06:09 in there because I have a bunch of outstanding music projects, which is itself a problem
00:06:13 but I don't pay as much attention to that as I do the other stuff, but aside from those
00:06:19 folders, I have had this technique that I've been using the whole time I've been making
00:06:23 videos, this is a very integral to my workflow, which is that because I'm so obsessed with
00:06:29 my desktop being clean, any video I'm currently working on that's not finished, if it doesn't
00:06:36 go in one of those four folders, it goes right on the desktop, all the project files
00:06:41 go straight on the desktop, and what that means is I can't get rid of them until I finish
00:06:46 the project, so the Coheed and Cambria video had an audio, all the videos of me talking
00:06:53 into the camera were all in the NNB folder because I just ripped stuff from the camera
00:06:58 straight to that folder, but all the project files for the Coheed music videos and their
00:07:02 songs and stuff and all that shit was sitting in a folder on the desktop called Coheed and
00:07:06 I couldn't get rid of it until I finished editing the video, which took weeks, because
00:07:13 I'll get into why in a second, then I did my audio book and that had to sit on the
00:07:19 desktop until I was done editing it, and this like, this worms its way into my mind, like
00:07:25 I need these things to be gone, and eventually if something sits on the desktop for long enough
00:07:30 and doesn't get finished, it will get thrown away, but I'm sure I've said this many times
00:07:35 before that for me, there's a very steep, harsh curve of my interest level in completing
00:07:44 a video, so there's the moment I get the idea for the video, which is a fairly high level
00:07:51 of excitement, depending on how quickly I think I'm going to do the idea, if it's something
00:07:55 that's like a vague idea that maybe I'm going to do in the future, but I'm not entirely
00:08:01 sure, it's a low level of excitement, I get a lot of those, almost every day, there's
00:08:06 some kind of idea that I'm like, maybe I can do a video about that, but I don't know exactly
00:08:11 how it would be, so we'll hold off on that for now, then there's the ones that I immediately
00:08:16 know what it's going to be, and I'm like, oh, I'm ready to do that, I can do that right
00:08:20 now, some of them are like, that would be a little bit too complicated, I'm not going
00:08:24 to do that today, that requires me to watch 10 shows, that one can get put off for a while,
00:08:30 but if there's an idea that's like, oh, I can do that right now, then it gets pretty
00:08:34 excited, now, whether it's a vlog and I'm getting in front of the camera, or if it's
00:08:40 a written post, the act of creating it is the highest level of excitement, if I'm writing
00:08:45 a post, I am super into it, particularly as I get close to the end, that's the highest
00:08:50 level of interest I have in this project getting made, is when I'm towards the back end of
00:08:55 finishing writing it, or when I'm recording the vlog, but after that, it goes straight
00:09:04 downhill, because if I have to start editing the video, I'm already past the part I was
00:09:09 excited about, which was getting the idea out there, manifesting this idea into writing,
00:09:15 making it concrete by putting it to paper, that's the exciting part, now I just have
00:09:21 to go through the process of making it presentable for an audience, which I'm not interested
00:09:26 in, and the more I listen back to this audio, the more I hear myself talking about this
00:09:31 thing, the less I care about the point I'm making, the stupider it sounds to me, the
00:09:37 more I feel like, was this even really worth it, why did I even make this, that's how
00:09:42 I start to feel as I edit, that's why DeVue edits my videos for me, because as that interest
00:09:50 curve goes down, the likelihood of it getting done, or it getting done well, also goes down,
00:09:56 and this is why a lot of my older videos reach that point where it might just be set to a
00:10:02 video game, like Sword Art Online and Analytical Diatribe, it's like I made this, it's an hour
00:10:06 long thing, you know, my interest curve peaked when I wrote that thing, it was starting to
00:10:11 go downhill after I had to record and edit the audio for that thing, you know, it was
00:10:15 still a pretty high level of excitement, but then the prospect of editing an hour of video
00:10:19 with relevant footage, and then knowing that it probably wouldn't get onto YouTube, because
00:10:24 at the time I didn't know how to get around YouTube systems, total decimation of interest
00:10:30 curve, let's set it to video game footage, you know, so I pay DeVue because when he gets
00:10:37 my videos, then he all at once hears the audio and immediately hits the top of that interest
00:10:44 curve, and then he edits it, you know, he edits it while he's in that state, and he's
00:10:49 like he stays there through the editing, and I do think it's, I think there's times where
00:10:54 even he, if he has to edit something for too long, it even for him it becomes like a, okay
00:10:58 I don't care anymore, you know, by the time he's finished, there's some videos I feel
00:11:02 like he, this shonen one, I felt like fairly early into editing because it was so complicated
00:11:08 because he had to gather so many fucking clips, I think he was starting to be like, I don't
00:11:12 know why I'm editing this fucking video other than that I'm getting money, you know, like,
00:11:17 he can correct me if I'm wrong about that, but like, it was an arduous edit, you know,
00:11:22 I could tell he was not as stoked about doing it because of how arduous the process was,
00:11:31 because Davoo's least favorite part of editing is having to just gather shit, like he's pretty
00:11:36 good at the plug and play of actually editing it, but the gathering part seems to stress
00:11:41 him out and he had to do a lot of it for this, so anyways, yeah, like, if I have to edit
00:11:48 for too long, the likelihood of it being finished goes down, and this is especially true for
00:11:55 anything that I don't see how this, like, what the impact of this is going to be, like
00:11:59 if it's something I don't really care about, then it goes down further and further, so
00:12:04 like, for instance, I got inspired when I was watching Shallow Rewards to make some
00:12:11 music content, like, to make a video explaining my history with a band, because like, a lot
00:12:18 of his videos will talk about a band's entire history, and I don't really have the kind
00:12:23 of knowledge that he does of like, what goes on in the industry or like, what was going
00:12:27 on in the minds of the bands and their personalities, but you know, with a band like Coheed and
00:12:31 Cambry, I've heard all their albums a thousand million times, I felt like I could talk with
00:12:35 some confidence about how I feel their music has changed, and maybe some of the reasons
00:12:39 that it's changed, but it's all very speculative and very gonzo, and I just kind of did it
00:12:46 unscripted and ranted, and I ranted for like an hour, and my idea with this video was I
00:12:50 was going to edit in music clips to try and help prove my point, that ended up being a
00:12:56 lot more effort than I thought it would be, and so this video that, as I'm listening to
00:13:01 it back, all I can find, like, all I hear is all the things, places where I use the
00:13:06 same word a thousand fucking times, I, everything is just sweeping and epic and huge, those
00:13:12 are the three words, and pathos, I say all those words a million times, and, and I just
00:13:18 hear myself getting facts kind of wrong, or just like, not really explaining something
00:13:25 and it does much depth, or like, certain places where I'm like, oh, why didn't I point this
00:13:29 out, that would have helped, or like, just all, because it's an unscripted mess, you
00:13:34 know, and I'm not really good at talking about music, and, and I was drunk and tired probably,
00:13:40 so like, this is, this is something that should not have had to be edited for the amount of
00:13:46 time that it did, you know, but it took a lot to edit it, and as I'm going, like, because
00:13:51 I don't really have that much enthusiasm for it, it makes it harder and harder to keep
00:13:55 working on it, so it sat on my desktop for like, two and a half, three weeks, you know,
00:14:00 like, I was just slowly plugging away at it with little energy, and then I keep taking
00:14:05 on all these other projects at the same time, so like, this one is just sitting around while
00:14:09 new shit keeps piling up, oh, we did another Let's Play with me and DeVue, oh, we did another
00:14:14 PCP, now I gotta, and make sure that gets out, and if that doesn't get out within a
00:14:18 couple of days, and the schedule's gonna get really fucking weird, you know, and like,
00:14:22 uh, it just becomes like a stack, a fuck shit stack, all on my desktop, and uh, so, god,
00:14:32 let me take a breath for a second, and these, the decompression chambers don't help either,
00:14:38 because I've been trying to keep these to a week, like a relatively weekly thing, and
00:14:41 I think I said on the last one that it, that it might be longer or whatever, uh, before
00:14:45 this one came out, but like, you know, when that week, when it starts getting towards
00:14:49 the end of the week, and it's like, oh, well, now I'm gonna do a decompression chamber,
00:14:52 well, that pushes, like, if I have to edit this, then I'm not editing the coheed video,
00:14:57 you know, and then I stacked on top of the coheed video, an even worse edit project,
00:15:02 which was the audio book, and I'm glad I did it, I'm actually very glad that I made this
00:15:08 audio book, I'm really happy with how it's come out, and the fact that it's out there,
00:15:12 by the way, um, I'm not making a video about it, but it's on my Reddit, on the our Digi
00:15:16 Bro subreddit, um, I might put a link to it in the description, if not, go find it, um,
00:15:22 it's called Tales from the End of the World Book 1, Scarlet City, it's a four hour audio
00:15:27 book, uh, and there's also like an hour and a half worth of podcasts I did about it, afterwards.
00:15:33 Check that out if you're interested, um, I don't really want it to be widely released,
00:15:39 but I do want to, like, sort of word of mouth spread it to make sure at least some of my
00:15:43 fans get to read it, uh, a few people have checked it out and their reactions were fairly
00:15:47 positive, so, uh, so far it seems to be a good time, and it's not that much of a time investment,
00:15:53 it's only four hours, even for the audio book, um, so, so yeah, I'm happy with how it came
00:15:59 out, but the editing process was such a fucking nightmare, because it was like, I got inspired
00:16:04 to do this all at once, and I just recorded, I just like sat down and in one sitting recorded
00:16:10 the entire thing, I just sat there for four hours and recorded an audio book, and then
00:16:15 I had four hours worth of audio that I now had to edit, which meant removing every stutter
00:16:21 and fuck up, and every, like, uh, tightening up spacing, that was the worst part, is that
00:16:28 like, you know, I wanted to make sure it flows well, because if it flows like garbage, then
00:16:32 it's just gonna be even worse of an experience, but it's not a good book, it's not work I'm
00:16:37 proud of, it's, I mean, I'm proud of it, but like, it's a six year old novel that, that
00:16:44 I never edited or revised at all, and like, it has tons and tons of glaring problems that
00:16:50 I'm well aware of, and so as I'm editing it, I just keep hearing lines that I'm like, oh
00:16:55 god, am I really editing this, am I really trying to make presentable, what is by all
00:17:01 accounts a not very good book that I know is not very good, uh, I just want it to exist,
00:17:07 and I'm not even releasing it widely, I'm just releasing it to like, an audience of
00:17:11 probably 15 people on Reddit, you know, like, why am I putting so much effort into this,
00:17:17 and because it's such a huge project, then even when I did like, pluck away at it a little
00:17:22 bit, you know, over the course of a couple days, it's just, it's so long that like, I'm
00:17:27 gonna have to put it on hold to go do the pub crawl or to go do something else, so yeah,
00:17:33 it was a nightmare to have this fucking four hour long burden over my head, and I finally
00:17:38 defeated it with the, the, the masterful technique that Dick Masterson came up with of the three
00:17:46 beers, I gotta tell you about the magic of the three beers, you see, I've always known
00:17:52 and I've, I've preached that editing is easier if you're a little drunk, like a little, at
00:17:57 least a little tipsy, you know, have a beer or two while you edit, because it, it helps
00:18:02 to numb the part of you that doesn't want to do it, like you, you still have enough
00:18:07 cognitive ability to do the job, because it's not hard, editing is not like, I don't think
00:18:12 editing takes a ton of thought, like you, you can pretty easily figure out what you want,
00:18:18 and it's rare that you come across something that's like, hard to do, that's like something
00:18:22 new that you haven't done before, usually you know what you're doing, and so it's just
00:18:27 a matter of plugging and playing, like hitting, you know, okay, this is the, I need to find
00:18:31 this clip for this line, I need to find this moment, I need to time it right, you know,
00:18:36 and all that can be pretty easily done without needing like a, like, you know, your full
00:18:41 brain, which your full brain is just desperately trying to rip itself away from this and do
00:18:47 anything else, it just wants something to stimulate it, and to not pay attention to
00:18:52 this editing, it wants to go to Twitter, it wants to go anywhere else, but when you numb
00:18:56 that part, when you numb your brain just a little bit, so that it can deal with doing
00:19:01 something boring and menial for hours on end, editing is way easier, and I've always known
00:19:08 this, but Dick Masterson came up with a formula for it, like a revelation, I mean, this man's
00:19:14 been a lifelong alcoholic, so he's in his late 30s, he truly has had time to perfect
00:19:20 this technique, but he said, three beers, he said, you know how I got through all my
00:19:25 emails finally, three beers, you know how I deal, like any situation that you need to,
00:19:32 you're like, I don't really want to do this, but I need it to get done, three beers, two
00:19:37 beers, not quite enough, you know, he said, you know, drink three beers, I think you can
00:19:43 drink three in the process, like for me, I usually start after like half of one beer,
00:19:48 that's enough to get my mind sort of in the game, to prep myself that like, all right,
00:19:54 just numb it a little bit and get it in there, you know, but the third, you can't go above
00:20:00 three, that's the important part, if you break over three, you're gonna get drunk and you're
00:20:05 gonna get, that's when you get dumb, that's when you get too dumb to actually do the thing
00:20:09 you're trying to do, but three beers, it has to be light beers or like relatively, you
00:20:14 know, not, you can't drink a strong ass beer and think that three is gonna keep you under,
00:20:19 you know, but you drink three relatively normal beers and you'll be good, and it's worked
00:20:27 wonders for me to the point that I'm now becoming an alcoholic, but I drank three beers and
00:20:34 made it through the entire rest of the editing and finally put that fucking chapter behind
00:20:39 me, all the let's plays are up, all that four hour fucking Q&A thing I did out of nowhere,
00:20:48 thank God I was able to edit that quickly, you know, like, because that's the thing,
00:20:53 I've got, oh, I'm working on this audiobook, maybe I'll do a 50k subspecial, oops, it's
00:20:58 four hours long, you know, what am I gonna do about this, you know, so yeah, I knocked
00:21:07 it all out, I got all of it done, and now I can start fresh, this isn't to say that
00:21:14 every single project that I have is, that I have open is complete, you know, and I closed
00:21:21 off a couple, I closed the finisher fail, not finisher fail, I closed off what's it called,
00:21:29 the board of second chances, and I closed off random ass recommendations, which I don't
00:21:34 know that anybody was like holding me to that anyways, because it had been like two months
00:21:38 since I did the first one, but I closed those off because they were kind of overkill, and
00:21:47 I can open them up later, but I was like, I need, there's certain series that I want
00:21:52 to start on that need to get started, and those ones are getting in the way, so what's
00:21:58 great about having like a clean slate of finishing all the old work is that I can like really
00:22:03 focus on, okay, now these projects that I want to get started, I can start on those,
00:22:08 you know, so there's a few, there's some, I have a few musical projects, I have a bunch
00:22:15 of musical projects that are unfinished, those ones though can kind of wait, I'm not in any
00:22:20 huge rush to finish my musical projects, because they're always kind of in a, there's kind
00:22:26 of a different mindset I approach those with, we're like when I make music, it's like getting
00:22:30 inspired specifically in the moment to work on it, it's not something I view as like a
00:22:35 project I'm continually working on, my music, you know, it's completely non-monetary and
00:22:40 has nothing to do with the rest of my career, it's really just something I do for fun when
00:22:45 I feel like it, so my musical project's not withstanding, there's only one, no, two videos
00:22:51 that I have footage for that are incomplete, one of them is the start of the new version
00:22:57 of Finish or Fail, and the other one is just this clip I took of a magazine thing that
00:23:04 I haven't quite decided what I'm gonna do with or if I'm gonna do it, I just have the
00:23:08 clip around, but all the podcasts are clear until now, now we've got this one, but that's
00:23:13 okay because, you know, there's nothing else there, keeping me from it, these are easy
00:23:18 to edit, they're not a big deal, and all the Let's Plays are done, so I can start up a
00:23:23 new Let's Play show, I've got an idea for a new show I want to do that I'm like, this
00:23:28 is one of those things where I got an inspiration the other night, like I had an idea for a
00:23:34 show that I suddenly was like, oh man, that's a really cool idea, I'm not gonna record anything
00:23:41 for it, because if I do it, it's just this audiobook's never gonna get done, this co-heat
00:23:46 video's never gonna get done, I just have to muscle through these fucking videos, these
00:23:50 shitty idiotic videos that I should never have taken on, I just have to muscle through
00:23:55 them, I want to become someone who finishes what I start, I never have been that guy,
00:24:04 it's always been a huge problem for me, it's always been so hard, and I really felt like
00:24:11 I got started on that road with the asterisk where it sucks, and it was very important
00:24:18 to me that most of it was written before any of it came out, like I wrote, I think there
00:24:25 were seven parts, no, there must have been at least four or five parts written before
00:24:30 I sent any to DeVoo, and I know there were eight parts written when the first part came
00:24:36 out, and then from there I continued writing it until the end of the year, and yeah, it
00:24:43 had to be so far along that there was no way I'd stop, that's the only way I could feel
00:24:52 comfortable letting it start to come out, because I'm always so worried that anything
00:24:56 I launch is not gonna finish, because that's how it's been in the past, if you were a follower
00:25:00 of my anime blog, which I don't know if anyone who listens to this was, I launched so many
00:25:06 projects, and they were always big, it would always be some huge thing, like, oh I'm gonna
00:25:12 review every single one of my favorite anime, I'm gonna review everything on my on hold
00:25:18 list, all 100 shows, I'm gonna randomize them out of a hat, though I built a randomizer
00:25:23 of show, there was one randomizer I had was I wrote the different years down on scraps
00:25:29 of paper, put them all in a hat, shuffled it, picked out a year, and then I had to watch
00:25:34 whatever show was on my on hold list from that year, now that I'm thinking about it,
00:25:38 this is actually a great idea, and I should do it again, because I only ever did one video
00:25:42 of it before, and it would be better than randomize recommendations, not one video, one text post
00:25:48 I mean, you know, I had this awards show, like, oh anime awards, I'll give an award
00:25:56 for each thing, the best show in that category, I think I wrote three of those and then gave
00:26:01 up on it, like, out of the 20 rewards I was supposed to give, it's just a, lots of episodes,
00:26:07 I'm gonna blog every episode of Utana, I got through three, you know, I'm gonna blog
00:26:12 every episode of Lane, I got through six, and you know, when I started doing anime videos,
00:26:19 that was one of my first goals was let's be someone who finishes projects, and that's
00:26:24 why I did Lane first, it was like, out of all the projects I had left unfinished on
00:26:29 my blog, that was the one I most wanted to finish, and so I did it, I mean, I completely
00:26:33 redid it from the ground up, but it was the same concept, and I fucking, and it almost
00:26:39 didn't happen, like, after the first four, I started doing like other videos, and like
00:26:43 they got slotted in, there was like these little vlogs that came out, I started concentrating
00:26:47 on other stuff, and I started to feel like, eh, the Lane videos aren't as, like, they're
00:26:51 not coming out as great as I wanted them to, but whatever, it got done, that was what
00:26:56 mattered, you know, and, and, you know, I've completed a bunch of projects since then,
00:27:02 I don't, I don't know that I've had any projects that had like a definitive amount that was
00:27:07 supposed to happen that have stopped, like, people keep asking me like, when are you gonna
00:27:11 do episode two of Interesting Anime Protagonists, and like, the thing is, I never had much
00:27:16 of a plan for that, like, I really had exactly two ideas, one of which I wasn't even that
00:27:22 excited about, I mostly just wanted to make that one video, and I thought that no one
00:27:27 would click on it if it was called like, you know, like, stoic anime characters or whatever,
00:27:34 like, or, or like, if I tried to give a name to that phenomena, then nobody would click
00:27:39 on it, but if it was just called Interesting Anime Protagonists, and then it was suggested
00:27:43 that this was just one type of Interesting Anime Protagonist, then people would click
00:27:47 on it, but I've never actually had a plan for how to continue that series, really, um,
00:27:51 and I still only have one other episode idea, but, um, but stuff like cool character designs
00:27:58 have kept coming out now, you know, um, there's a few that I need to do more of, but none
00:28:04 of them were that like, rigidly defined, whereas there's stuff like, there have been video
00:28:08 projects that have just died because I didn't get it edited in time, you know, where like,
00:28:13 I eventually lost interest in the concept or just thought, uh, this project's too big,
00:28:18 I can't actually finish it, you know, I want to become a guy who finishes things, and I've
00:28:23 got one really massive project that I'm kind of at the advent of, like, I'm a bit into,
00:28:31 you already know what I'm talking about, like, I guess I should also become someone who can
00:28:35 finish videos I've spoken about, because this has been a huge fear of mine, because it used
00:28:39 to be that any time I talked about a project, it wouldn't get done, um, this is especially
00:28:44 true in the pony days, every time I had a big video I would talk about, it would never
00:28:48 get made, um, and so I've been like terrified of that ever since, but like, right now, the
00:28:56 big project that I have is the shaft one, you know, and I wrote Akuki Shinro in the
00:29:01 early 2000s, which is like the lead-in to Dissecting Shaft, which is supposed to be like a 16-part
00:29:06 series about all the shaft shows, and you know, I'm gonna have to start on that at some
00:29:12 point, but like, I want to become the guy who can finish that, even though I've talked
00:29:16 about it, even though it's a huge daunting task, I want it to exist, and I need to do
00:29:23 it, I need to become the person who can do that, and um, I feel like I'm, I feel like
00:29:31 I'm getting there, you know, I've got another cool little idea, the one I talked about earlier,
00:29:36 which now I get to do it, like I had this great idea for a video, and I said I'm not
00:29:40 gonna do this until I edit the rest of the audio book, and until I finish the Kohiid
00:29:47 video, and I did, and it also was like a test of, you know, because another fear I have,
00:29:53 the reason I launch into projects on top of each other so quickly is because I'm always
00:29:56 scared that if I put it off, I'll lose interest, you know, I want to get these things out there
00:30:01 while they're fresh, but like, now I've had a couple days and it's like, yeah, this is
00:30:04 still a good idea for a video, I should still do it, you know, fuck it, let's fucking launch
00:30:08 this video idea, it'll be cool, we'll see what happens, we'll see where it goes, it
00:30:13 may or may not become a series, we'll find out, um, but yeah, so that's, that's where
00:30:20 I'm at today, I finally finished all my outstanding projects, uh, I could probably, by the time
00:30:27 this podcast comes out, because I think I've been recording for about 30 minutes, so this
00:30:34 will probably be a couple days late, because I'll have to have more things to talk about
00:30:38 before this gets published, but um, by the time this is out, maybe I'll have those last
00:30:45 videos I mentioned that are, that are like, you know, that I, that just kind of have the
00:30:49 early workings, maybe those will be out too, maybe even the cool idea I'm hinting at, maybe
00:30:54 you'll already know about it, um, so yeah, I'll see you then, and, and also in the next
00:31:03 part, I don't know, I'm very tired and kind of delirious, uh, from editing this fucking
00:31:07 co-heat video all night, um, so, yeah, whatever.
00:31:16 Uggghhh.
00:31:18 So here's a first for this, uh, podcast, I actually just listened back to the previous
00:31:24 part, before recording this part, just to make sure I wasn't gonna repeat myself too
00:31:28 much, or to remind myself exactly how I presented these concepts that I was talking about, not,
00:31:34 not usually something I do, I usually listen to these, um, after I've uploaded them, not
00:31:39 even really during the editing process, but, um, I wanted to expand on some of those things
00:31:46 I said, and, uh, readdress some of it, because now that I've, you know, now I've done more
00:31:54 projects, I, with that liberation I felt from having all my projects finished, I then immediately
00:32:00 launched into more projects, and it was interesting, I kept them, because of that pileup I just
00:32:06 experienced, I put a lot of, um, I really wanted these to each be done before the next
00:32:12 one started, like I kind of slotted them one after another, so, after the co-heat video
00:32:19 I did that Hamtaro one, the Handfuls of Zen, which may be a series, I don't know how long
00:32:25 of a series it'll be, or how frequent it'll be, but, um, I'm excited at the idea of it,
00:32:31 it's, basically the idea is that it's a Game Boy Advance show, and, um, because Game Boy
00:32:37 Advance is kind of, I see it as a console I'm the most connected to, it's, it's like
00:32:43 games that are, I don't want to say it's like my favorite console or anything, or even that
00:32:47 it has a lot of my favorite games, it's just that the games are very well suited to my
00:32:51 interests, in terms of I really love the graphical style, um, there tend to be simplistic and
00:32:57 short, which is helpful for me, and I've played a lot of them, like the era that I played
00:33:02 the most video games was probably the Game Boy Advance era in my childhood, so like I'm,
00:33:07 I'm very familiar with the console, and with like all the classics, you know, a lot of
00:33:10 consoles I had, but I didn't have the classics that everyone remembers, and I, I did for
00:33:15 the GBA, as well as some more obscure games, and I have an interest in obscure ones, so,
00:33:20 um, so I thought it'd be neat to do a Game Boy Advance show, but I don't want it to be like,
00:33:27 I just wanted it to be as not obvious, or, or something that, that I'm like beholden to as
00:33:33 possible, I wanted it to have a title that doesn't really say, this is about the Game Boy Advance,
00:33:39 you know, like, Handfuls of Zen, once you get it, you're like, oh, okay, because it's a handheld
00:33:43 console, um, and also the episode numbers, I didn't want there to be numbered episodes, because
00:33:49 there's something that holds you, when you have like episode one, and then episode two,
00:33:54 then you suddenly feel like this has to reach a certain number, like there has to be a certain
00:33:59 number of these, and they have to come out at a certain rate, like, because when you think episode,
00:34:03 you think weekly, you know, you think, oh, well, yeah, episode one, so episode two comes out next
00:34:08 week, or even monthly, um, as a lot of uploaders are, you know, more infrequent, at least this is
00:34:12 how I think, I don't know if anyone else thinks this way, but like, I, I go, I usually go way
00:34:18 out of my way to avoid episode numbers, unless it's a series that I really don't care about that
00:34:23 much, like most of my, uh, my finish or fail style things, the ones where it's like me just sitting
00:34:28 around watching something, and I'll give it like, you know, spin the crunchy roulette number five,
00:34:32 because why, there's nothing else to distinguish it, like, I'm not gonna list every show that we
00:34:37 watch in the title, so it's just a way to distinguish that it's not the same one you already watched,
00:34:42 sort of, um, but I don't really care about if those series, you know, reach a certain number of
00:34:47 episodes, because they're kind of like a, like a joke anyways, in the first place, um, or just
00:34:52 for fun anyways, so with, with handfuls of zen, rather than giving it an episode title, the number
00:34:58 is just the number of the game, because every Game Boy Advance game has a number, for some reason,
00:35:04 they all have a number between zero, zero, zero, one, and two, eight, one, zero, I believe, in, in
00:35:12 order, so yeah, they're all numbered, not sure why, but I've just posted the number as the episode
00:35:16 number, and I thought that was a really fun and cryptic way to do it, um, I've been pretty inspired,
00:35:22 there's one video by Shallow Rewards that was, that really wormed its way into my mind, and, and
00:35:29 really interested me on a deep level, because it's something I'd never completely thought about,
00:35:33 which was about people hiding their work, about deliberately making things that aren't meant
00:35:42 for mass consumption, that are meant for just the people who would care about it to see it,
00:35:48 and I feel like it's something I've always been interested in, and I've, I've made lots of like
00:35:54 alternate blogs and alternate sites that I don't connect to myself in the past, not so much anymore,
00:36:00 these days I really want my core fans to be able to find a lot of my stuff, but I don't, I don't
00:36:05 necessarily want all of it to be like widely distributed, you know, I really do want it to
00:36:10 just be those core fans, um, you know, back in the anime blogging days, I had my main blog, which,
00:36:17 when it was first made, was called Digital Boy's Anime Blogging, then its name got changed to euphoric
00:36:23 field after I watched F A Tale of Memories, then it got changed to Fuzakenna, once I bought a domain,
00:36:29 and then it got changed to my sword as unbelievably dull, once I got rid of the domain and went back
00:36:35 to just being a wordpress blogger, yeah, quite a trajectory, but in the meantime I also had side
00:36:42 blogs, some of which I was like posting just completely other alternative stuff that just
00:36:48 wasn't in the same style as the main blog, not that the main blog had a very defined style,
00:36:52 but for instance, at one point my blog was on hiatus and I deliberately decided to put it on a
00:36:57 three month hiatus, like I even said at the beginning, like this is how long I'm going on hiatus 4,
00:37:02 and I took a break from anime pretty much entirely, but I got really into manga, and so I just kind
00:37:08 of created this entire other persona who was a manga guy, and his blog was called Is That You
00:37:16 Motiliata, which is a line from a Mars Volta song called This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed,
00:37:25 and the tagline of the blog was this manga must be unearthed, you can still find the site,
00:37:28 isthatumotiliata.wordpress.com, good luck spelling that, unless you look up the Mars Volta lyric,
00:37:35 but the the the writer was named Se Di Se Bisante, which means is this a bison,
00:37:41 which is from, or this is a bison rather, yeah, this is a bison, not a buffalo is the name of the
00:37:47 album by Omar Rodriguez Lopez, who's the guitarist of the Mars Volta, so everything's kind of themed
00:37:54 around the Mars Volta and Omar in the in the titling of this of this character and site,
00:38:00 but on this website I was just writing about manga in, but in like a character that wasn't
00:38:06 like me, it was a much more like polite and upstanding figure, because my blog was always
00:38:12 extremely crass and in your face, and there was swearing constantly and perverted humor and stuff,
00:38:18 and like I just, I always had this very in your face personality, and I thought that if I tried
00:38:24 to write in another style, if I tried to like bring in a series that wasn't quite the same, then
00:38:32 people would just, I mean everyone knows it's me, so they wouldn't really see it as like another
00:38:37 person, they just see it as me doing a weird affectation that is clearly not how I normally write,
00:38:43 and that was what I was concerned about, so I made an entirely new site,
00:38:49 new blogger, you know I got it, there's this, I don't know that it had like any readers,
00:38:54 I had a few comments here and there, because there's this anime blog aggregator that people
00:39:00 used to use back in the day called Anime Nano, and you would try to get your, if you had like a
00:39:04 decent number of posts, you could get onto Anime Nano and it would just post your stuff up there,
00:39:08 and you could get some clicks that way, it was a decent way to get a little head start,
00:39:14 so I had gotten onto Anime Nano and I think I had a couple readers,
00:39:19 but I really was just doing it for myself, like I was just blogging manga in this very
00:39:24 in-depth and interesting way, the posts were all like medium length, it was always like
00:39:30 probably between 500 and a thousand words, not very long, but they would break down the artwork
00:39:37 in manga, and it was written in this very polite normal tone that was nothing like me at all,
00:39:45 and yeah it was just a matter of like I didn't want this to be the same crowd as my main blog,
00:39:50 I just wanted it to stand on its own, and if you know whoever took an interest in it would take
00:39:54 an interest in it, regardless of it being something I made, now eventually I gave up on the blog,
00:40:00 it only lasted probably like mostly it was only active during the time I was on hiatus on the
00:40:04 main blog, and then I posted like a couple more times there, and then eventually I imported all
00:40:08 those posts back onto the main blog, so they are still, they're all on my blog and on the original,
00:40:15 and I've had other times where I kind of compartmentalize things differently and
00:40:20 split things into different places, and I still do it obviously with DigiBro versus
00:40:25 DigiBro After Dark versus this channel versus my Reddit board, you know everything has its own
00:40:31 place, and this idea of deliberately, like I guess it never occurred to me, like with that
00:40:40 manga site, it wasn't like I was trying to not let it get popular, I still would have liked it to
00:40:45 be popular, I just didn't want it to be associated with the same writing style as my main blog,
00:40:51 and I'm sure eventually I would have revealed that it was the same guy or something, or if the
00:40:56 other blog got more popular I would have probably jumped ship and just become that guy, but
00:41:02 but like making something and then hiding it, like not wanting it to get popular, like
00:41:11 putting it somewhere where I don't want, I'm putting it somewhere that only people I want
00:41:17 to see it will see it, that was something I hadn't given too much thought to, but it makes perfect
00:41:23 sense to me, because so much, there's so much stuff that, that like, you know I don't want everyone
00:41:31 seeing certain things, like and this is the case for my audiobook, which you know this podcast
00:41:37 right here only has 5,000 listeners, which to some people would seem like a lot, and to me
00:41:41 seems like not very much, because it's you know, politically compared to my other channels,
00:41:46 but those 5,000 listeners, the kind of things they're listening to on this show,
00:41:50 they're the kind of people who can appreciate this book, who I'm okay with hearing it, you know,
00:41:54 or the people who are on my Reddit board, that's where I released it, is on Reddit, you know,
00:41:58 I'll probably link it to my patrons at the end of the month post I'm gonna do,
00:42:04 those are people I can let the story be heard by, because again, this is a very odd story that
00:42:10 was a portrait of who I was when I was 19, it's not me currently, you know, and yet it is, like
00:42:17 there's a lot of me in it, and you can still tell I wrote it, but, but you know, it's not polished,
00:42:24 it's not something that was made consumer-ready, I recorded the audio book just so that it would
00:42:30 get out there, even though the book itself was never finished, you know, it's got missing
00:42:34 chapters, it's got plot holes, it's got just stuff I would completely change,
00:42:40 as you can hear detailed in my podcasts, so yeah, I decided to hide it, I decided not to put it on
00:42:46 Digibro After Dark, because I don't want to read comments about what's wrong with this book,
00:42:52 because I know what's wrong with this book, it was written nine years ago and never edited,
00:42:56 I know exactly what's wrong with it, you know, I have no desire for it to get out there and try
00:43:02 to have a life of its own, and increasingly, I don't know how much, I want a lot of things to do
00:43:10 that, you know, for me like a post on Digibro is one that I'm trying to, like there's a reason
00:43:16 that so many of the videos that go up on Digibro are about like trying to change the public
00:43:20 conversation, like Digibro is almost like a like a rallying cry channel, like every video I post
00:43:28 is like me trying to affect the way that the masses talk about anime to some extent, you know,
00:43:33 it's it's maybe a little pretentious even, but like there's always that tone of hey I wish you
00:43:40 all would would talk about it this way, you know, hey why don't we stop talking about subversions
00:43:47 because it doesn't fucking mean what you think it means and it's obnoxious and it just shows that
00:43:51 you haven't read enough shonen manga, you know, like that's the tone of that video, so those things
00:43:57 should be out there, those things are meant for the masses, they're meant for me to they're me
00:44:01 trying to change the cultural tide, but not every not every little thought I have, not every little
00:44:08 like this podcast is not meant for the masses, this podcast is meant for whoever it would interest
00:44:16 and I've always had this mindset that you have to cast a wide net in order to catch
00:44:22 you know the fish you want, right, like let's say that there are 5000 people out there who would
00:44:29 enjoy my audiobook and if I only cast a net around 5000 people and 50% of those turn out to not be
00:44:38 people who would like my audiobook then you know I'm only getting half of what I could be getting,
00:44:44 so if I cast a net that's 10 times wider maybe I'll catch all 5000 of those people but I'm also
00:44:50 gonna catch a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't that doesn't care, you know a whole bunch of people
00:44:54 who don't care or who actively dislike it and like because I've always had that mindset of like I
00:45:01 want everyone who could possibly be interested in this thing to see it then I've never taken a step
00:45:07 back and gone like well I mean in the end people are gonna miss out on stuff they would enjoy,
00:45:13 that's just a fact of life there's too much shit out there that you would enjoy and for me as someone
00:45:18 who collects recommendation charts like as a fucking hobby I know this all too well I have like
00:45:24 hundreds of books and movies and video games and comics that I'm never gonna get to even though I'm
00:45:32 sure I'd like them but like you know unless unless the fucking singularity happens and I get my life
00:45:38 extended by a hundred years I'm not catching up on all this stuff and I shouldn't be necessarily
00:45:44 trying to catch every single person because I don't really need them like I'm I would like it if
00:45:51 everyone who would like my stuff would see it but I don't need everybody who does so to do so like I
00:45:56 can be satisfied with a couple thousand views and like a hundred comments on a video that's like a
00:46:02 great amount you know if I can make a video like uh like this mindless self-indulgence one I just put
00:46:07 out you know and it's a concept I've had for years I mean I even thought I did this whole spiel
00:46:13 in a in a halo let's play once but no one watches the halo let's plays you know no one watches the
00:46:19 the digi and friends let's plays um so like that whole spiel even though I'd done it before
00:46:27 a lot of people hadn't heard it and I wanted to make it its own like nice glossied up video
00:46:32 and I will say I'm glad I did the coheed one just for the experience of figuring out how it would
00:46:38 look like how a me talking about music would come out if I tried to throw in clips and stuff
00:46:43 because the MSI video was a breeze to edit I legit recorded it and then edited it all in one sitting
00:46:50 it was like maybe three hours four hours from concept to completion and uh that's rare you know
00:46:57 for for something that that's that's that heavy on editing for me to just like immediately grind
00:47:01 it all out but it was because I was excited about it because I thought I made my point well
00:47:05 there wasn't a whole fuckload of factual inaccuracies or weird shit it wasn't an hour and a half long
00:47:10 you know it was exactly what I wanted it to be concise and and well made and I did it and I was
00:47:16 like yeah that coheed video gave me the experience to figure out how this would work and it worked
00:47:20 really well um and just seeing you know a handful of comments that are like either wow I've liked
00:47:28 this band forever and I didn't know this stuff that's cool or man you really got me interested
00:47:32 in this band that I had never heard of before or like uh that's an interesting take on the
00:47:37 kind like just a few comments like that is enough I don't need it to be like seen by everybody I
00:47:42 don't need it to have a hundred thousand views that would be nice for making money but I have a
00:47:47 channel for making money you know the digi bro channel is for making money the patreon my you
00:47:52 know a lot of the people on patreon are people who watch like all my stuff and they're paying for
00:47:56 just me existing essentially you know I only really need the core audience the ones who are the
00:48:02 the patreon the patreon people are the people I really need you know I still make by far most
00:48:07 of my money on patreon not so much through ad revenue because I don't go out of my way to make
00:48:12 all my videos super monetizable and it's funny because I could do it I'm like I feel like I was
00:48:18 born and bred as the perfect youtuber in a way because uh there's this recent game theory video
00:48:25 about youtube's changes that they've been implementing that like everyone's been freaking out
00:48:29 because youtube's been changing their algorithms and stuff and game theory did a video that like
00:48:34 explained it in concrete terms and kind of put a lot of the rumors to rest well at least you know
00:48:40 attempts to but basically the way that youtube is working right now is that they're not only
00:48:45 rewarding retention time which is something we've known about for a couple years that youtube
00:48:48 rewards you for the length of time that people watch your videos but now they're also
00:48:52 rewarding you for coming back every day now I'm somebody who puts out hours of content
00:48:59 every single day I'm perfectly primed for this you know but the funny thing is that I almost
00:49:06 released them in a way I wouldn't say deliberately but the way I release videos does not optimize on
00:49:12 this ability if I had everything on one channel like just said fuck it to all these weird divisions
00:49:18 and all this like all this like concept of how I want these things to be released and I just put
00:49:22 it all on one channel and released it all at the rate I do I think it would actually like balloon
00:49:28 in success I think that like if all of this was just on digi bro everything I do is just on digi
00:49:34 bro I think it would actually maybe not everything you know keep out the rap videos and all that
00:49:38 weird shit that can stay on after dark but if a lot of these vlogs I've been doing we're up there
00:49:42 a lot of these podcasts I think it would become more successful and uh and make me more money
00:49:49 through ad revenue but there's also sacrifices in doing that because all those big youtubers who
00:49:56 are concerned about this they're the people who make their money mostly through ad revenue
00:50:00 like the only reason to be worried about youtube changing its ad revenue rules is if you make money
00:50:05 through it I don't really worry about ad revenue I don't even check it like I get the money in the
00:50:10 mail once a month and then I'm just like oh oh I guess I made money through ads this month you
00:50:16 know like I don't even think about it at all because I really just worry about the patreon
00:50:20 I really just worry about the the fan payments because that's not only is it the biggest
00:50:24 source of income those are the people I care about you know I care about the idea that I'm
00:50:28 making something people want to pay for more so than that I'm making something that will make money
00:50:33 and what those people lose out on all those big youtubers is their comment sections are garbage
00:50:41 you can't get any real feedback you know you've got way too many people vying for your attention
00:50:45 the whole internet becomes hard to deal with I've I've been there I've been in that position like
00:50:51 even though I was not as famous like when I was big in the brony clique it was really like
00:50:57 like I couldn't talk to any any bronies unless they were other video creators because they they
00:51:02 see you as like this celebrity guy it's a little bit this way in anime too like if I head out
00:51:08 if I were to head to some forum somewhere or like just talk to people casually on the internet they
00:51:13 come in with a huge amount of presupposition about me because they see the funny thing is that the
00:51:18 people who are really into my work I don't think see me as much of a celebrity like you guys anyone
00:51:23 listening to this podcast you probably see me less as a celebrity than people who barely know me
00:51:28 people who only know me as like a guy with 250 000 subscribers and they've seen like maybe one or
00:51:33 two of my videos they see me as like this whoa it's digi bro that famous anime youtuber you know
00:51:40 when I did the wave motion cannon podcast like the guy who was like uh josh he was like shocked
00:51:45 he was like wow I'm actually talking to you and I'm like uh yeah I'm a guy who reads anime blogs
00:51:50 I'm an anime blogger of course you're talking to me why like I read your fucking website read
00:51:56 everyone's website you know um that's the kind that's how I feel about it and I feel like the
00:52:01 people who engage with my content who know that you can find me in the comments you can find me on
00:52:07 my reddit you can find me on my patreon you know I don't respond to everything but you know I'm there
00:52:13 you know I'm not some like untouchable celebrity off somewhere who doesn't you know even like have
00:52:19 the time to engage with fans even though I don't read the comments on the main channel anymore
00:52:23 but that's exactly the issue that channel's too big I can't read the comments on it anymore
00:52:27 when a video gets over a hundred thousand views you can pretty much say goodbye to nuanced discussion
00:52:32 in the comments and don't get me wrong I still get lots of great comments on there in fact I'd say
00:52:37 more so than bad ones it's just that people have less context the more the more a video gets big
00:52:43 the more people are watching it who don't know me and the people listening to this show or listening
00:52:49 to the the the after dark show they know a lot about me they have a lot more context they know
00:52:54 kind of what I'm about what kind of comments I'll respond to you know like what kind of discussions
00:52:58 I want to have on the internet a lot more so than people who come in for just one video and and are
00:53:04 lacking in that context and um and that's something I value I like having a dialogue with my audience
00:53:11 I to me it's always been about the depth at which someone appreciates something not so much how
00:53:17 many people appreciate it you know I don't that's why I'm not a like a pop guy I'm always I'm boogie
00:53:23 pop I've said this a thousand times that like pop is all about appealing to a lot of people a little
00:53:28 bit whereas boogie pop is about appealing to a smaller number of people a lot and uh and that's
00:53:35 what I hope that I do and you know I know from my fans that I do in it so it's it's really great for
00:53:42 me that I was able to put out this novel that I wrote six years ago and um and a few people listen
00:53:50 to it I didn't even I didn't expect like the most I expected to listen to this is like at the absolute
00:53:57 most even after this podcast even after all the any time I mentioned this book because I'm going to
00:54:01 mention it probably a few times you know I'm going to mention it here maybe I'll mention it here or
00:54:04 there on after dark and I'll definitely mention on Patreon the absolute most people I expect to
00:54:09 ever listen to this book is like maybe 30 and that's including my offline friends you know Victor
00:54:13 has already listened to it um Ben and DeVu probably will at some point so so yeah like I I don't
00:54:23 expect a lot of people to listen to it but the second I had like two opinions about it I was
00:54:29 satisfied like it was all worth it as soon as like I was able to have a conversation with Victor
00:54:34 about my book that I wrote all these years ago that I've never stopped thinking about you know I got
00:54:38 to have a conversation about it I get to see I get to read people's reactions to this book I don't
00:54:43 care you know how many people see it I don't care how many like how deep these reactions are just
00:54:49 wanted there to be some reaction just wanted to know does anyone like this does anyone care about
00:54:54 this is this interesting at least you know and the responses have pretty much been yeah it was
00:54:59 pretty interesting all right yeah I kind of liked it you know like that's basically what all the
00:55:03 responses been there's been like five or six people who've commented on it on reddit and uh and
00:55:08 that's enough then that's enough to make it completely worthwhile and maybe there's going to be more
00:55:14 stuff that I kind of hide a little bit and handfuls of zen to bring this back because I'm sure you
00:55:19 forgot that this is what I brought this up for is like a pseudo hidden video because it's not
00:55:27 the Game Boy Advance show it's not a review of ham ham heartbreak you know it is handfuls of zen
00:55:36 it's on the digi brother dart channel the people who are going to watch that video
00:55:40 are mostly going to be my fans I don't want it to be I don't want it to escape into the hands of
00:55:47 video game fans and I mean if I have one let's say I cover like the most popular gba game you know
00:55:53 and I have nice things to say about it and and some some new people come in and most of them
00:55:58 will probably just react to that video but maybe a few of them will become fans of the show and
00:56:02 watch the other stuff and find it interesting that's great you know I love getting new people on board
00:56:07 but what I don't want is that I put out a video called Castlevania aria of sorrow review and I
00:56:14 make some negative comments about it and then I get a bunch of people showing up to complain
00:56:18 funnily enough the coheeding cambria video it has some of that like not so much in the comments
00:56:24 but I it some coheeding cambria fan twitter like it was like hashtag all things coheed I think was
00:56:31 the name of it something like that they posted it up and they were like uh see how far you can make
00:56:36 it into this video before closing and they tagged me in this post and then of course all these
00:56:41 responses come in I didn't even make it 30 seconds well this guy seems like a total asshole like
00:56:47 people who literally know nothing about me who know nothing about what the video is supposed to be
00:56:52 or the context surrounding it they just clicked on a coheed video they interpreted it as negative
00:56:57 and they freaked out that's why I have to hide some things you know and that video is not even
00:57:04 like made to be super public I mean I did give it a relevant thumbnail and title so but I even
00:57:10 called it a fans retrospective specifically so it wouldn't be taken that way like I originally
00:57:14 was gonna call it coheeding cambria what happened but then I was like that makes it sound too like
00:57:20 like like I'm trying to write an article or something like something more objective if you
00:57:24 will whereas if I put a fans retrospective it makes it more clear this is a personal story you
00:57:30 know and I and I try to like really in the early part try to be really fair about the idea that
00:57:34 like this maybe the band's not even gone to shit maybe it's just me you know I go I go on a lot
00:57:38 about that but you know on some level the video has to stay hidden because the video is not for
00:57:43 coheeding cambria fans that's not who the audience was intended to be it's just me telling a story
00:57:50 about a band that I that I like you know it's more about my narrative it's more for my fans to just
00:57:56 see something kind of fun and cool about some band they maybe have heard of or maybe not um
00:58:02 so yeah that's why like with this hand with the samples of zen thing it's it's it's really about
00:58:10 it I wanted it to be its own thing it's not the gameboy advanced show it's that video is not a
00:58:17 ham tarot video it's my video that uses those elements and I think that that that is kind of
00:58:24 what I get out of something like shallow rewards where that show has a title shallow rewards you
00:58:29 know it's it's not just the name of the guy making it like it is a show unto itself it has its own
00:58:35 style and none of the videos are just about the thing he's talking about it's about his presentation
00:58:40 of the thing he's talking about and the cult of personality that is his you know his writing
00:58:46 so that's kind of where I find the value in hiding things and um and it's really a privilege I have
00:58:54 because I have a main revenue stream and I think there's a I mean don't get me wrong I think there
00:59:01 is somewhat right now a fetish is a fetish is fetishization is that the word yeah okay it seems
00:59:06 like it needs more syllables there's currently a fetishization of working uh like making money off
00:59:14 of art like I think because there's more people who are able to do it online now than like everyone's
00:59:20 chasing that and I don't think that used to be like as common of a thing I think it used to be
00:59:25 that there were a lot more people who worked normal jobs and did art just because they enjoy it and
00:59:30 that it was never meant to get big and you still see this like there's lots and lots of let's say
00:59:34 like cover bands for instance if you ever go see like um a few of my god probably close to a year
00:59:41 ago me and a couple of friends went with my mom to some bar where some 80s hair band cover band
00:59:47 was playing and it was just like like a bunch of 40 year old guys who get together every probably
00:59:52 month or so and do a bunch of covers of hair metal songs because they want to and it's fun and they
00:59:58 get to hang out with a bunch of people at a bar and get drunk and it's a good time and I think that
01:00:04 maybe everyone is trying to be like their own celebrity and to make like a whole career out
01:00:11 of art now and they think that that's the only way to do art as opposed to just doing it on the side
01:00:16 because you want to which is a great way to get started and I mean if you think of my career in
01:00:22 terms in like a full scale that's what it was for the longest time you know my anime blog was never
01:00:27 intended to take off I wrote it for seven years before it got before it took off and um and now
01:00:33 I've been writing for over nine years close to 10 if you you know count my my anime blog as part
01:00:38 of it or my channel rather so yeah like I feel like people need that kind of build up time and
01:00:47 everyone's just trying to like launch a career out of art immediately out the gate and some people
01:00:51 are lucky some people can do it some people manage to get that either through having good
01:00:57 connections or just being incredibly talented right when they start but I think everyone
01:01:03 else is looking at those people and trying to be them and I think that because I've been lucky enough
01:01:09 that I had such a long time of build up and then I did launch a career through art and because it
01:01:14 manages to make enough money that I don't have to work at it constantly I actually have time to do
01:01:20 other projects that are just out of passion that have nothing to do with making money you know
01:01:25 nothing on digibro after dark is ever made to make money with the like one exception of the ghost in
01:01:32 the shell video because I thought it would be really funny to see if it can make 100,000 views
01:01:36 and it did so like nothing else on the channel is oriented around making money the procrastinators
01:01:43 channel is not making me any money you know this these videos these decompression chambers I can't
01:01:49 like I monetize them but they're they're not even on my channel you know it's connected to Nate's
01:01:54 account um Nate has said that he eventually wants to like split up all the pcp money amongst all of
01:02:01 us once it's like actually made some money and he's collected it but like you know I'm basically
01:02:06 just doing this for free I mean the most it would make us would be five dollars an episode for for
01:02:09 these decompression chambers but like you know I'm not making any money off of this I'm just doing
01:02:16 it because I feel like it I'm just doing it because it's something I want to do um and I wrote the
01:02:20 I did the audiobook you know for an audience of spend a week editing it for an audience of what
01:02:26 will probably at most be 30 you know 30 people I'm doing all these things that are just they're just
01:02:33 for me and uh and that really is a privilege because a lot of my friends are trying to become
01:02:40 successful you know they're trying to make a job out of it um even though some of them are just I
01:02:44 mean because it's not a job yet they're just doing it on the side for now but like it's because I make
01:02:51 enough off of those videos that it doesn't have to be a full-time career I don't have to be I don't
01:02:55 have to make it so I am getting out a 20 minute video every single day on a main channel just to
01:03:02 make a buck you know which is what like all those big youtubers who are complaining now that like
01:03:08 that youtube's algorithm is not working out for them you know they only have to complain about
01:03:13 that because of the fact that they have to make ad revenue dollars you know and I don't I I'm privileged
01:03:19 to not have to do that I get to have um you know my own system that works for me because my fans are
01:03:26 willing to pay for it so yeah I'm lucky enough that I get to do whatever the hell I want um which
01:03:31 is exactly what I always wanted my career to be so it's really beautiful for me
01:03:44 so the other benefit of having released that audio book is that I got to spend a lot of time
01:03:52 thinking about it and thinking about my writing uh my fiction writing that I used to do because for
01:03:58 a very long time that was my goal was to be a fiction writer and um sort of what incited me to go
01:04:05 and do that book and let me know if you find this an interesting concept which I know a bunch of
01:04:12 people are gonna say yes regardless because it's a video I suggested and I've never been like hey
01:04:19 does anyone find this interesting and had nobody say yes because someone's always gonna find everything
01:04:24 interesting but I had this idea that I would record a podcast just explaining all my old stories
01:04:31 like I was just gonna go through one by one and find every old story I'd written like every concept
01:04:37 I had uh and like half written first chapters and stuff and just uh explain all of them and I
01:04:43 thought this would be a fairly simple thing but then I started going through all my notebooks
01:04:50 and I realized I have a shitload of stories that I was coming up with back then like I mostly
01:04:56 remember a handful of like the most uh you know the ones I got the farthest with and because it's
01:05:01 been such a long time since I quit it never occurred to me like just how many fucking ones I had
01:05:06 I found like one page that's called like ongoing projects and there's 30 stories on that page
01:05:13 and then I like found all these other ones you know I'm just like going through these notebooks
01:05:16 that have all these fucking character bios all these little short synopses and stuff some of them
01:05:20 are like the title of a story on a page and like one line of description of what it would be
01:05:26 but other ones are like these whole fleshed out universes and shit and I was like holy
01:05:30 fuck I had so many fucking ideas um I spent so long trying to do this and um you know even
01:05:37 after my novel I wrote a few more things before I finally gave up on the whole novelist thing
01:05:42 but rereading the book really reminded me of like where my actually I won't even say reminded it
01:05:48 taught me where my strengths lie as a writer because back then I you know I wasn't a professional
01:05:54 I wasn't as good as I am now I wasn't as good of an analyst as I am now you know I can analyze
01:05:59 my own work just as well as I can analyze anybody else's uh but you know back then I was much younger
01:06:05 uh wasn't as critical didn't know as much about like what makes good storytelling or good writing
01:06:10 and now I can look back at that book and be like huh you know I I I have kind of a knack for
01:06:16 character writing and construction and like giving characters distinctive voices um and I have some
01:06:22 pretty pretty good dialogue some of it's corny as shit but there's moments where the dialogue is
01:06:28 really interesting and I of course could do it a lot better now because I have much better taste
01:06:32 um you know there's a lot of potential there like when you read through it you really feel like man
01:06:37 if this guy had kept writing he'd be great and that's my brother explicitly said that Victor
01:06:42 listened to it and he was like you know it's not really bad at all and he was like if you had been
01:06:46 writing fiction the way that you've been writing blog posts like if you had kept doing it all this
01:06:52 time you would be as good at fiction as you are now at analysis and I was like yeah that's true
01:06:59 like I would be I would actually be great at fiction if I kept doing it this whole time um I just
01:07:04 didn't and then but it's it's weird because it's not like I haven't been writing you know like even
01:07:10 though I'm writing in a different field I feel like a lot of the skills I have from this can easily
01:07:15 be reapplied to fiction and like now that I've kind of analyzed my story and thought about like
01:07:21 huh well if I just did this like if I cut out this element like you know uh I was never good
01:07:28 at constructing like um strong narratives I was always good at like character interactions and
01:07:33 more slice of lifey kind of stuff because that's more of what I was interested in at the time anyways
01:07:38 um I'm better at like constructing a scene that means something about a character like the the
01:07:44 development kind of aspect and not so good at creating a plot and uh for some reason I was always
01:07:51 stuck on the idea that I really needed a plot back then even though so much of what I liked
01:07:54 didn't really have a plot at all but now I know how to write like much smaller stories not everything
01:08:01 has to be like some big deep sci-fi concept like it was in that book and so uh I think I could do
01:08:09 it a lot better like I think I could take all the elements I was great at and construct something
01:08:13 new and so I'm just kind of looking at this book and looking at the reception it's getting which has
01:08:17 been all positive I mean it's only a handful of my closest fans who have read it so it's not like
01:08:23 I'm gonna get these huge negative comments but I was really shocked by how much like my brother Victor
01:08:27 liked it you know um who like there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff about this book that it
01:08:32 would be easy to hate and people didn't hate it as much as even I did like I was really harsh on it
01:08:38 when I first read it and I recorded a podcast about it and then I did a follow-up podcast where
01:08:42 it kind of softened up because I'd had more time to think about it and been like yeah I guess it
01:08:45 is kind of interesting now I think about it um and so all of that's kind of inspired me that I
01:08:50 might get back into fiction I'm I've been coming up with more like I was I came up with a story
01:08:57 concept I like I'm gonna maybe try to run with it and see where that takes me and see if I can get
01:09:03 back into fiction because I guess I was shocked by how not shit I was I expected to be more shit
01:09:11 and I wasn't that shit and I feel like I could improve improve quickly and I have plenty of time
01:09:17 like all it would take away from is probably time spent doing I don't know decompression chambers
01:09:24 or something or or all these fucking podcasts I mean I've even with the crazy amount of output
01:09:30 I have I still spend hours out of every day just kind of like laying around fucking staring at the
01:09:36 ceiling you know um so it's not like I am completely maximizing on my time although I will say I've
01:09:43 been working a fucking lot lately definitely a lot more than I ever have before these days I've been
01:09:50 much more of a workaholic but there's something I guess this is how I'll end this is by explaining
01:09:55 this last thing that like back in April um we had me and Davoo we had finished the asterisk
01:10:03 suck series in like January February that area um and the patreon got high enough that I could
01:10:10 start paying him full time where like it became his job he left his job and became just my editor
01:10:16 because I was able to pay him enough to make it worth it you know and so when he first joined me
01:10:23 as a full-time editor I wrote out a schedule for the month of April I believe it was April
01:10:29 and it was five videos I think there was one and a half I think that I'd written before the
01:10:35 month had started two of them are videos I'd conceptualized a long time before and then the
01:10:39 other ones were like new it was interesting anime protagonists uh the how hayami isaki
01:10:44 maps the setting the the one about stray little devil what else was there I think there were two
01:10:51 more um I think maybe what is the appeal of anime was that month and I think there was one more
01:10:58 but I had these five ideas oh cool character designs shimanetta I think that's the last one
01:11:04 and um I I not all of them were fully written I had a couple written I sent those to him and
01:11:10 then I was writing the rest over the course of the month but it felt so good to have a plan
01:11:14 because I'd never gone ahead with a plan like that I've never had a full month planned ahead
01:11:18 until that point um I usually was like you know coming up with a concept writing it immediately
01:11:23 making it and then having to come up with another concept I was very rarely working ahead of myself
01:11:29 so April was the first time ever that it was like here's a whole schedule and we'll make each video
01:11:34 has a deadline for when it's going to come out I have to have it written by a certain date and
01:11:39 then you have to have it published by a certain date you know and we did it we kept to the schedule
01:11:44 the whole month perfectly the next month we did something similar it was a more simplistic
01:11:49 schedule because there's only four videos which is one a week we got it done and um we didn't
01:11:55 keep doing that every month because eventually uh there was like a month where I only had one video
01:12:01 I just didn't want to do any of these concepts I had and then we did rad con and then divu moved in
01:12:05 and then it became like this frantic hectic schedule but then for the month of november
01:12:11 I won up to myself because I wrote all of the november videos in october all five of them
01:12:19 were written before the month even began and that was a whole new level this wasn't just
01:12:25 scheduling it was a whole new level of this I talked about this in a previous decompression chamber
01:12:29 and as a result the vu had his work cut out for him all the way up until just recently and like
01:12:34 I wrote the the like because we pushed back the shonen video that was supposed to come out in
01:12:38 october we pushed it back to december so that one um yeah we got all the november videos we
01:12:43 have the first december video done I really only need three this month I'm gonna do like a month
01:12:48 ending post on patreon so I already had the next one written back in october and now I just need
01:12:53 a third one for december basically what I'm saying is that I got so far ahead of myself in november
01:12:59 that I'm like that I'm so that like now I have there was no rush there was no rush to finish the
01:13:06 december work in in november and there's still no rush to finish the december work even halfway
01:13:11 through december because I was just that far ahead of myself and that's given me time to do
01:13:16 all these other projects all these other weird little things like this audiobook like handfuls
01:13:20 of zen and it's kind of like man I'm I'm fast enough and good enough at coming up with concepts
01:13:28 and I have such a wealth of ideas that I could do this forever like I can always be this far ahead
01:13:33 of myself and I can always keep coming up with new things and why that's so valuable why I'm
01:13:38 explaining that is that that is the environment in which I can write a book or write fiction or
01:13:45 write or make more music or learn to draw finally like those are all things that the
01:13:50 reason I haven't done them is because I'm scared of them taking away from my career I'm scared
01:13:55 that if I can't work on my main series videos then then you know that that will deteriorate
01:14:02 while I'm trying to work on this other shit but if I can have and this is what the this is what
01:14:07 I've been advertising on patreon from the beginning like it always said like the the highest goals
01:14:12 were always if I make this much I can do other things you know I can do bigger crazier things
01:14:18 and if I can continue to do something like you know what if I get two months ahead of myself
01:14:25 you know if I have two months where the video is written before any of them come out I can do
01:14:30 whatever the fuck I want for two months two months is enough time for me to finish literally
01:14:33 anything you know I wrote a novel in in a in a month before I wrote the asterisk war sucks in a
01:14:39 in a month and a half you know um I could do I could do a novel in one month and polish it the
01:14:45 next month I could design uh you know I could write something and then illustrate it the next month
01:14:53 you know like something like that I could do crazy bigger projects by getting so far ahead of myself
01:14:57 and always having that like that knowledge that I'm good enough to make that happen and I don't
01:15:04 think I would have been that good at any other time before like this is how I know I'm improving
01:15:08 because those five videos were all good like if I tried to write five videos in like six days which
01:15:15 is how I did if I tried to do that even at the start of this year they would have all come out
01:15:19 shit I mean if you look at the october thing where I did the video a month a day all month in 2014
01:15:26 most of the videos are not worth going back to there's like a small handful that are
01:15:30 but like most of them were just like little throwaway things that had nothing to do with
01:15:34 anything that were just me trying to rush through the month um if I did that today I could I mean
01:15:40 this is what I was trying to do at the time that I wrote the the five videos I was gonna write a whole
01:15:45 fucking uh 15 of them I think 15 or yeah it was supposed to be 15 but I ended up writing the ones
01:15:53 that I was the most interested in and then leaving the rest on hold but like they all came out as
01:15:58 fully fledged videos that I was completely proud of not one of them do I think though I have anything
01:16:02 negative to say about I loved all five of those videos they came out exactly how I envisioned
01:16:07 pretty much so um that's something I can only do now and I really feel like I'm reaching a point
01:16:13 where I can do all these things creatively that I've been dreaming of for years now
01:16:18 um and so maybe you'll see the fruits of that in the near future um
01:16:27 this is a very upbeat podcast probably uh compared to the last two I think the the last one was me
01:16:34 complaining about uh not having not getting laid not having a girlfriend um which incidentally
01:16:41 I just like after that podcast I just completely forgot about the online dating thing and went
01:16:46 back to what I was doing which is making videos and drinking constantly and the week before that
01:16:52 was the depression chamber so this is a pick me up this time yeah yeah back in the back in the
01:16:58 saddle the good old fun digibro saddle you know we're we're having a good time again I hope you
01:17:06 enjoyed this video I hope um I hope you are not one of my friends who is currently creatively
01:17:14 unfulfilled and is now stewing in bitter uh anger over my success I hope you're having a good time
01:17:21 thanks uh thanks for listening play us out jazz boys
01:17:51 um
