00:00:00 The Pro Crastinators Podcast
00:00:06 Hello, everyone!
00:00:08 Ah, boo.
00:00:10 Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it in.
00:00:15 Fine. Hi, everyone. Welcome to the episode about what is the limit of free speech?
00:00:22 What is the show that we're on?
00:00:24 You have to say the name of the show.
00:00:27 Well, no, he doesn't. They don't know.
00:00:29 Yeah, freedom of speech. He doesn't have to say anything, motherfuckers.
00:00:33 Should it be illegal to chew Tums whilst doing a podcast?
00:00:39 No, you should be eating Tums at all times.
00:00:42 No, this is a terrible idea. I disagree with you.
00:00:44 Tums taste disgusting.
00:00:46 What?
00:00:48 I hate Tums. They taste like vitamins.
00:00:51 Tums are alright.
00:00:52 What about chewing on Mentos while you drink Diet Coke?
00:00:55 Endless Jess eats through an entire thing of Tums just because he likes them.
00:00:59 For fucking leisure?
00:01:01 You know, Michelle has had a stomach ache. I've just snacked on some Tums when there's Tums around.
00:01:06 I've eaten like two or three.
00:01:07 I don't think I've ever even had a Tums.
00:01:09 It's like the same with those gummy vitamins. They're delicious.
00:01:11 They're just giant sweet tarts that are fucking great and they make your stomach not hurt anymore.
00:01:16 And you can eat like ten of them a day.
00:01:18 Tums taste good?
00:01:20 Tums are bizarre and disgusting like twisted interpretation of like a butter mint.
00:01:26 They're like butter mints, but they taste like cough medicines.
00:01:29 Do you guys remember when I found that jar of gummy vitamins that had melted in the sun
00:01:36 and fused into a puck and I carefully extracted the puck from the bottom of the bottle
00:01:42 and then took a big bite out of it and briefly became the healthiest creature in the universe
00:01:47 and leveled the entire city block that I was living in.
00:01:51 You guys can introduce now.
00:01:53 Hey, so who's here?
00:01:55 Yeah, let's get over to the left over here.
00:01:59 We have a man who crosses professional boundaries to criticize individuals in his own medium, Digibro.
00:02:05 I am a monster of a man.
00:02:10 And I will rape.
00:02:13 We have the sometimes frustratingly silent hypocrite.
00:02:18 Nigger.
00:02:20 It wasn't silent just then.
00:02:22 Oh, no.
00:02:24 We have the man who deigns to criticize an entire half of Homestuck, Munch.
00:02:28 It's me, welcome to Manga Mondays.
00:02:32 Today we're going to be talking about sex.
00:02:36 Ah, trick you.
00:02:39 We have the resident nigger guy, Nate Besteman.
00:02:42 That's not accurate.
00:02:44 Also, I would say that lesbians are physically incapable of having sex with each other.
00:02:51 That's my free speech.
00:02:53 Guys, I didn't know this until I thought about it for a second like three years ago.
00:02:58 Scissoring isn't possible, basically.
00:03:01 Well, you can get close.
00:03:03 What do you mean it's not possible?
00:03:05 The Mac doesn't check out, Ben.
00:03:07 It just doesn't check out.
00:03:09 Audience weigh in. Tell us when the last time you scissored was.
00:03:11 Think about it. Think about the actual act of scissoring.
00:03:14 What do you mean?
00:03:16 There wouldn't be enough pressure.
00:03:18 You make the pressure.
00:03:20 Are you trying to say that two vaginas being pressed together can't cut through paper?
00:03:24 Is that what you mean?
00:03:26 Yes, that is what I mean.
00:03:28 They'll moisten and tear the paper.
00:03:32 It won't be a clean cut.
00:03:34 That's why lesbians don't check from construction work.
00:03:38 We have been female black faces saying that.
00:03:43 Wow, female black face is just offensive.
00:03:47 Regular black face is back and it's cool again.
00:03:49 But female black face is out.
00:03:51 It's still not okay.
00:03:52 You know, we're not there yet.
00:03:53 Give it time. Give it time.
00:03:55 That reminds me of my old catchphrase nigger bitch funeral
00:03:57 that I kept saying all the time and people would give me weird looks
00:04:00 and I was like, I don't know why I keep saying it.
00:04:03 And we have Tom, who I can't really think of anything you've said that's ever been offensive,
00:04:07 so introduce yourself.
00:04:09 I'm scared of this episode already.
00:04:11 This is going to be good.
00:04:13 We've got two loaded episodes back to back.
00:04:16 Tom, according to...
00:04:17 Tom, communism is the only moral economic system.
00:04:21 It was originally Karl Marx's birthday.
00:04:25 My lord and savior, apparently.
00:04:27 Oh, was it his birthday?
00:04:28 Oh, that's right. Happy birthday, Karl. You did it, buddy.
00:04:31 You did the episode properly.
00:04:34 To begin the actual topic, has this ever happened to you?
00:04:39 Complain about something that people are doing to which someone else goes,
00:04:42 well, it's my free speech to which someone else goes,
00:04:44 well, it's my free speech to criticize your free speech,
00:04:46 to where someone else goes,
00:04:47 to my free speech to criticize your free speech,
00:04:49 to criticize my free speech,
00:04:50 to which someone else should go.
00:04:52 Why do you even following this line of argument,
00:04:54 but no one ever does?
00:04:56 That's what we call a free speech cascade.
00:04:58 That was a words cascade that just washed over me.
00:05:01 Like, I was drowning in the ocean.
00:05:04 Well, it's been every day of my life.
00:05:06 The last 15 years have been on the fucking Internet, man.
00:05:08 Yeah, I mean, it's been forever.
00:05:10 You'll see a lot of the time these days.
00:05:12 People want to get technical victories over each other,
00:05:16 so someone will say something,
00:05:18 and maybe it's slightly overly general,
00:05:20 and the other person will say,
00:05:21 well, that doesn't apply to everyone.
00:05:23 All right, you know what it is?
00:05:25 It's the modern gun.
00:05:27 Yeah.
00:05:28 Because guns were invented so retards don't get killed.
00:05:32 You're like, oh, I'm physically deficient and weak,
00:05:36 and big people can beat me up and take everything I have,
00:05:39 so I'm going to invent a device.
00:05:40 Is that what we call a retard?
00:05:41 A physical retard.
00:05:42 Yeah, well, you know, if you are in any way,
00:05:46 if you are in any way retarded,
00:05:48 as in, like, to be lessened in some way,
00:05:53 like you are lessened than the regular human.
00:05:56 You mean, like, disabled,
00:05:57 do you just mean, like, people who are not able to punch some other line?
00:06:01 I mean, like, when you say, like, something's claimed retardant,
00:06:02 you mean to say that it, like, is not capable or claimed?
00:06:04 I don't think that's a common term.
00:06:06 Retarded just means slow.
00:06:08 Yeah, exactly.
00:06:09 I see it all the time.
00:06:10 If you're too slow, like, you're not fat,
00:06:12 you can't run away from the big guns
00:06:14 who are going to catch you and beat your ass.
00:06:16 Sonic is a ultimate neurotypical.
00:06:17 He's always fucking mansplaining.
00:06:18 Yeah.
00:06:19 So what you're saying is that nowadays
00:06:21 you just use technical fallacies to, like, get out of here.
00:06:24 On the internet, what is strength?
00:06:26 What is physical strength is intelligence,
00:06:28 because all anyone has is their words and their argument.
00:06:31 So if you're intelligent, that means that, theoretically,
00:06:34 you should destroy everybody on the internet.
00:06:36 However, they invented guns,
00:06:38 and the guns are called rhetorical argument,
00:06:41 where they can fuck you on the technical aspects of your argument,
00:06:45 and they don't have to be intelligent.
00:06:47 They just have to know these so-called rules.
00:06:50 But, like, because of the fact that if you're too intelligent
00:06:53 and you're actually following the rules,
00:06:55 but doing it in a way that, like, goes above people's heads,
00:06:58 then it doesn't matter, because they have the gun, you know?
00:07:01 Oh, and if you're too intelligent,
00:07:04 you could, theoretically, say everything exactly right,
00:07:07 but people will just latch in on one of the, you know,
00:07:10 areas that touches something that's simply politically
00:07:12 incorrect or incorrect,
00:07:14 and then they can just make a whole case about how, like,
00:07:16 it's not that your argument is wrong,
00:07:18 it's that you shouldn't be listened to because you've said, you know,
00:07:21 that's basically what happened with that Google thing, right?
00:07:24 Yeah, that's true.
00:07:25 When can I cash in my IQ points for various prizes at the store?
00:07:30 I want to cash in it for tickets or coins.
00:07:33 You do that at Chuck E. Cheese, dude.
00:07:35 You just got to go there.
00:07:36 It's a game of wits to Chuck E. Cheese, yeah.
00:07:38 Yeah.
00:07:39 So, hey, everybody.
00:07:41 That's why you go to school.
00:07:42 You go to school to build up your IQ points,
00:07:44 to go to Chuck E. Cheese to cash him in
00:07:46 for a plastic ring shaped like a spider,
00:07:48 and then you do all these things.
00:07:50 It's like when I played Ganguro Girl,
00:07:52 and many of the clones of Ganguro Girl,
00:07:54 where you got to go to the library and read
00:07:56 to buff your intelligence points so that you can woo
00:07:58 the slutty girls who like smart guys.
00:08:01 The titular Ganguro.
00:08:03 I was at Stephen Buster's,
00:08:05 and I was getting mad IQ points
00:08:08 while studying the art of monkey ball,
00:08:10 and I got so smart that I was able to purchase
00:08:13 with my raw brain power a Pinkie Pie plush.
00:08:16 This is your story.
00:08:17 Whoa, holy shit.
00:08:19 The Pinkie Pie would be pleased by this story.
00:08:21 Guys, I think no one should be able to say anything
00:08:23 at any time, regardless of circumstance,
00:08:25 or law, or whatever amendment made.
00:08:27 It's your freedom of speech to think that, so, you know?
00:08:30 We did cover how language is a problem,
00:08:32 but we got to just ban it.
00:08:34 So I've been asleep since the last PCP,
00:08:37 and my memory is a little hazy.
00:08:39 I just woke up from a stupor.
00:08:41 The last one we did was on language, right?
00:08:43 That's like the same thing.
00:08:44 It's like a sequel.
00:08:45 Yeah.
00:08:46 Also, it is.
00:08:47 You've got to put the build upon.
00:08:49 The fatigue department as well.
00:08:51 The groundwork.
00:08:52 You've got to build upon the groundwork that we laid.
00:08:54 Specifically what the prompt of this episode is,
00:08:57 because we're trying to sometimes have prompts
00:08:59 that are like full sentences rather than just single words.
00:09:01 Yeah.
00:09:02 So that the conversation isn't so amorphous and vague
00:09:04 and weirdly utilitarian.
00:09:06 The specific title, for us at least,
00:09:09 is what is the limit of free speech,
00:09:11 because that's where really interesting
00:09:13 and also very frustrating debates take root,
00:09:16 which is when there's things right on the line
00:09:19 between someone expressing themselves
00:09:22 and someone pulling off an extortion.
00:09:24 Hey, can I?
00:09:25 Can I?
00:09:26 Wait, I got something.
00:09:28 I just looked up.
00:09:29 I'm looking at the definition of free speech
00:09:31 on UrbanDictionary.com,
00:09:32 and I got to say it's extremely enlightening.
00:09:34 Here we go.
00:09:35 Get ready for this truth bomb, everyone.
00:09:39 Free speech, dictionary definition,
00:09:42 the right to express any opinions
00:09:44 without censorship or restraint.
00:09:46 College definition,
00:09:47 the right to express any opinions
00:09:49 without censorship or restraint,
00:09:51 unless you're a conservative.
00:09:53 Yeah.
00:09:55 Got him.
00:09:56 Smash.
00:09:57 Smash the glass ceiling.
00:09:59 Smash the conservatory.
00:10:01 So that is that writing prompt,
00:10:03 that question prompt of what are the limits?
00:10:05 Oh wait, definition two?
00:10:06 Definition two?
00:10:07 Yeah.
00:10:08 Nothing more than an illusion.
00:10:11 Wow.
00:10:12 This guy is moose.
00:10:14 Moose, this guy moose who wrote that one.
00:10:17 Moose, he's a woke boy.
00:10:18 Well done, champ.
00:10:19 Let me throw out my position,
00:10:21 and then I'd be interested to hear rebuttals,
00:10:23 because I think mine is one of the extremes.
00:10:25 So I think, like,
00:10:27 so free speech is a legal issue.
00:10:29 It's like, should you be put in jail
00:10:31 for saying things that are wrong?
00:10:33 I think that you should literally not
00:10:36 be criminally penalized
00:10:38 for saying literally anything,
00:10:41 except, oh, but okay, that's not true,
00:10:43 because then the shedding of fire
00:10:44 and a crowd at theater could actually kill people.
00:10:46 As long as your words.
00:10:48 Okay, by extension, let's say, for example,
00:10:51 that there's a Jewish kid,
00:10:52 and then everyone starts calling him a kike,
00:10:54 and then he kills himself.
00:10:56 If that happens, what's the connection here?
00:10:58 Is that free speech?
00:11:00 Should that be criminalized?
00:11:02 The thing about it is that
00:11:04 the speech is not entirely the point.
00:11:07 They could have just easily said,
00:11:10 we don't like you, you're different,
00:11:12 and none of those words are technically wrong,
00:11:14 but that is what killed them.
00:11:16 The words themselves don't matter.
00:11:18 I don't think those people are responsible for his death.
00:11:21 They're not murderers,
00:11:22 but they were deliberately abusive,
00:11:25 which is not cool.
00:11:26 I mean, I would say that they
00:11:28 just give people free reign to do that.
00:11:30 I would say that his death is partly,
00:11:34 they are partly to blame,
00:11:36 but it had nothing to do with the word choice.
00:11:38 Can we at least agree on this to begin with?
00:11:40 No individual word itself
00:11:43 should ever be forbidden from being spoken.
00:11:46 Exactly what I wanted to bring in and say,
00:11:49 I wanted to say that outside of context,
00:11:51 no individual word can possibly be seen as harmful
00:11:54 unless there are certain frequencies
00:11:56 in our fucking neuro system that can be irritated
00:11:59 by certain syllables.
00:12:00 There is no way that individual words
00:12:03 outside of context should be put into the realm
00:12:06 for niggers only if you know what I mean.
00:12:08 I think the fact that even in academic
00:12:12 or journalistic writing,
00:12:15 you have to say the N word,
00:12:18 that is so immature and ridiculous to me,
00:12:23 because we know what the fucking word is!
00:12:26 I know what it is!
00:12:28 Just say the word, I'm not a child!
00:12:31 If you say it, I'm gonna think it!
00:12:33 Yeah, you bitches.
00:12:35 Think inwardly.
00:12:36 Is this really helpful?
00:12:38 Wait, did you say think inwardly?
00:12:41 I know, right?
00:12:43 We sent this episode with the word inward
00:12:45 and I kept thinking it was inward
00:12:47 and if you listen back to that,
00:12:48 you'll hear me saying inward.
00:12:49 Oh, how interesting.
00:12:50 Well, we wouldn't be showing that.
00:12:52 No, but there you go.
00:12:54 But anyway, I was gonna say that like,
00:12:57 the reason I think people say inward
00:13:01 is specifically for kids, right?
00:13:03 That's the big thing that everybody comes back to.
00:13:05 But here's my position.
00:13:06 Well, okay, maybe not.
00:13:08 Maybe with a word like nigger.
00:13:10 You better not let your kid listen to a single rap song ever.
00:13:14 See, but that's my point.
00:13:16 I'm listening to Kanye.
00:13:18 We gotta ban hip-hop because we love black people.
00:13:22 Hip-hop that uses the N word, I guess.
00:13:25 But okay, here's my position.
00:13:26 Was that racist of me to imply
00:13:28 that black people make rap music?
00:13:30 I'm sorry.
00:13:31 That's about as racist as saying
00:13:33 that black people play more basketball,
00:13:35 which I think is just true, right?
00:13:37 Maybe I was racist.
00:13:39 Let me look up the urban dictionary of basketball
00:13:42 and we can get to the bottom of this.
00:13:44 Okay, here's the important thing about this.
00:13:45 First, I was gonna say that kids should just hear any word.
00:13:48 I don't care, it's fine.
00:13:49 But about this other topic about being racist or whatever,
00:13:53 I think that there's two important things to do
00:13:56 at the same time when you're making any of these kind of statements,
00:13:59 and it sort of relates to free speech.
00:14:01 It's that you can make statements about groups
00:14:05 that just are demonstrably true.
00:14:08 For example, black people are more propensity
00:14:10 to get sickle cell anemia or whatever.
00:14:12 That's simply a fact.
00:14:14 But then if you look at an individual black person
00:14:17 and you say, hey buddy, you're getting sickle cell anemia,
00:14:20 that is in fact racist because you're discriminating based on race.
00:14:25 Every individual just needs to be treated as an individual.
00:14:27 I prefer Cooley's anemia.
00:14:29 I have to go back a step.
00:14:31 It's my favorite anemia.
00:14:32 My mind is being torn and twain thinking about this.
00:14:35 I need all of you to participate in this with me
00:14:39 and ask me this question of yourself.
00:14:41 You're like Mark Twain who wrote literature
00:14:42 that used the word anemia.
00:14:43 Literally, what is the worst that can happen
00:14:48 from your kids learning swear words?
00:14:51 They will save them.
00:14:54 They'll make you uncomfortable by saying them.
00:14:57 That's literally the only reason.
00:14:59 That's literally it.
00:15:00 You even hear people who are pretty open about free speech
00:15:04 talking about how they still don't want kids saying bad swear words.
00:15:09 But really why though?
00:15:11 What the fuck?
00:15:12 Let me fucking go through this.
00:15:14 I think you might be in a similar boat to me on this
00:15:18 because we both grew up very proud to follow the rules.
00:15:23 Proud to do what our parents said on some level.
00:15:27 With my family, my brother and I had a sort of pact
00:15:32 that we were like we're not going to swear till we're 18.
00:15:35 That was just the thing we said.
00:15:37 I started breaking that in the eighth grade
00:15:40 because I would swear at school in front of school kids
00:15:43 but I never swore at home in front of Victor and Shay
00:15:45 because I didn't want to let them down.
00:15:47 Neither of them started swearing till they were 18.
00:15:49 They just kept to it the whole way
00:15:51 whereas I was a piece of shit and broke it early.
00:15:54 The thing is we knew the swear words from childhood
00:15:58 because my parents had showed us Beavis and Butthead
00:16:01 and South Park when we were little.
00:16:03 I knew all the swears and I used to swear when I was a kid.
00:16:06 But when I was going into elementary school,
00:16:08 my parents were just like,
00:16:10 yeah, this word, this word, this word,
00:16:12 don't say those at school.
00:16:14 I was like, okay, because I was a well-mannered kid.
00:16:17 I just didn't say those words except for it.
00:16:20 I wouldn't even say them at home eventually
00:16:22 because we decided we weren't going to swear
00:16:25 because we wanted to be good kids.
00:16:27 Once we were all 18, we just started swearing constantly
00:16:31 because we all know the words.
00:16:33 My parents swear constantly as it is.
00:16:36 They weren't protecting us from it.
00:16:38 That's how we think.
00:16:39 And the consequences of this have been
00:16:41 literally nothing because everyone swears all the time.
00:16:45 It doesn't fucking matter.
00:16:50 I was just thinking about that.
00:16:52 I'm curious about the whole black market of swears
00:16:58 in school meta is you're not allowed to say this
00:17:02 and then kids would be like, fuck.
00:17:05 And then everyone would be like, hmm.
00:17:07 And I'm like, if it's swear words,
00:17:10 would kids come up with words that are banned
00:17:16 or would they just secretly...
00:17:18 There's always things that you're not allowed to say.
00:17:20 If it's not swear words,
00:17:22 would it be something else that they would be like
00:17:24 to show how cool they are?
00:17:26 The answer is yes because me and my brothers,
00:17:29 in replacement of all the swear words,
00:17:31 we just said things that were similar,
00:17:33 which the funny thing is that the things that we said
00:17:36 in place of them could get us in trouble
00:17:38 in some of our friends' houses or at school.
00:17:41 We would say heck or frick or freak.
00:17:44 Dude, what the freak?
00:17:46 Exactly, the famous dude with the freak brother.
00:17:48 You said that in one of the early videos in your old channel.
00:17:50 Dude, what the freak?
00:17:51 Well, because we were under 18 when we made those videos,
00:17:54 so we didn't swear at any of them
00:17:56 because we were going to show them to our parents.
00:17:58 We didn't want them to see us swearing or anything.
00:18:00 We just wouldn't swear even in the content.
00:18:03 But the words we were using,
00:18:06 I would go to friends' houses and they'd be like,
00:18:08 you can't say that word.
00:18:10 They function like saying the N word.
00:18:12 They work in the exact same way.
00:18:14 Exactly, but it's like,
00:18:16 you can't avoid having a word for those situations
00:18:19 because that's how you learn to talk.
00:18:22 It's how normal people speak and how the media strikes.
00:18:25 You're absolutely right, but let me ask you a question real quick, everybody.
00:18:27 If I go up to a black person and I say,
00:18:29 you fucking N word,
00:18:31 how, like, do I win?
00:18:34 Do I get off scot-free for saying these things?
00:18:36 Like, I did not work.
00:18:38 I win, right?
00:18:40 Is this just the racial slur podcast?
00:18:43 No, I feel like we're focusing a little too heavily.
00:18:46 Literally everything that you talked about,
00:18:49 I want to say a thing about.
00:18:51 Other families, other things you can't say.
00:18:53 For example, white trash.
00:18:55 I am doing a fucking favor
00:18:57 for a family of a friend of mine, right?
00:18:59 I'm driving them to a place
00:19:01 for, like, a really important thing
00:19:03 and no one else is willing to help them.
00:19:05 I'm taking time out of my day to fucking do this shit.
00:19:07 And I tell a white trash joke, right?
00:19:09 And I guess it's more or less
00:19:11 at the expense of their family,
00:19:13 but, like, my family and me
00:19:15 we're all equal levels of white trash.
00:19:17 We're all, like, pseudo-voromazurians over here.
00:19:20 So I didn't think of it as, like, a thing,
00:19:22 but, like, I guess they were a little bit quiet
00:19:24 and then my friend was like,
00:19:26 that wasn't appropriate when we were alone.
00:19:28 And I'm like, you fucking nigger.
00:19:30 I'm helping you people fucking out
00:19:32 on the one fucking driving.
00:19:34 And according to other people who I've spoken to
00:19:36 in my life, if you're driving,
00:19:38 you set the fucking rules for all fucking speech.
00:19:40 That's the first one.
00:19:42 I want to respond to Ben, though.
00:19:44 Ben, the reason I think that
00:19:46 our kind of first trajectory...
00:19:48 Real quick, to just piggyback on what he said
00:19:50 just a little bit, I absolutely agree.
00:19:52 Anybody who talks shit about you
00:19:54 when you're doing them a favor can get fucked.
00:19:56 Well, of course. Absolutely.
00:19:58 Especially if you're, like, shitting on my music
00:20:00 when I'm driving you around.
00:20:02 I then confronted my friend on that
00:20:04 about calling that inappropriate.
00:20:06 I was just saying it was offensive to them.
00:20:08 I'm like, look, I'm fucking triggered
00:20:10 by the word inappropriate.
00:20:12 That's my fucking trigger.
00:20:14 Because, like, being a well-mannered child
00:20:16 generally, the only thing
00:20:18 my dad would ever get me on
00:20:20 would be, like, overreacting to something
00:20:22 or inappropriate something.
00:20:24 So anytime anyone uses those words,
00:20:26 you have a times 20 chance of pissing me off.
00:20:28 Just a fucking record.
00:20:30 Just a fucking, you know...
00:20:32 Now everyone on the internet is going to be like,
00:20:34 hey, Davoo, you feeling inappropriate today?
00:20:36 Hey, but
00:20:38 what Ben was saying about race, I think this ties into...
00:20:40 Yeah, Ben has a lot to say about race.
00:20:42 Let me tell you.
00:20:44 Wait, no.
00:20:46 But this is what I was going to say.
00:20:48 The reason that I think that's our
00:20:50 place to start with this is because
00:20:52 what exactly is
00:20:54 a swear or something that you can't say?
00:20:56 It's like, they're like
00:20:58 basically a crass way of
00:21:00 referring to a forbidden topic.
00:21:02 So, for example, like,
00:21:04 nigger, racial...
00:21:06 whatever, like WAP, grease ball, etc.
00:21:08 All these, they imply
00:21:10 racism, and really that's what's
00:21:12 not acceptable, and that's perfectly reasonable.
00:21:14 I want to let everyone know that this is
00:21:16 literally the most
00:21:18 alt-right podcast we've ever made.
00:21:20 That's not even true.
00:21:22 Dude, no.
00:21:24 I have an answer to this question.
00:21:26 In an academic way, but like...
00:21:28 I don't know.
00:21:30 Fast and loose.
00:21:32 Stand-up comedian David Crow postulates
00:21:34 that swears have a lot to do with their phonetics
00:21:36 more than just their semantics.
00:21:38 So, for example, like...
00:21:40 It feels like you're getting whipped
00:21:42 by someone else's mouth, whereas if you just say
00:21:44 sex, it's just a little bit more
00:21:46 harmless or like...
00:21:48 Ben's right that we don't need to focus specifically
00:21:50 on swear so much. I need to jump back to that
00:21:52 alt-right comment that Munchie made, because
00:21:54 I seem to remember where, like,
00:21:56 ten years ago, this was
00:21:58 literally the entire Louis C.K.
00:22:00 stand-up routine, and every
00:22:02 liberal was behind him.
00:22:04 Well, we know what that boy was up to in those days.
00:22:06 Yeah.
00:22:08 He went back on a lot of it.
00:22:10 He became a fucking Libcuck because
00:22:12 that's where culture went.
00:22:14 But, like, that, like, literally
00:22:16 the stuff I was saying earlier about the N-word
00:22:18 thing was literally a bit he did.
00:22:20 I mean, we stayed the same, and the Overton
00:22:22 window has shifted around us, but...
00:22:24 I was thinking a lot, Digi,
00:22:26 about how the internet, like,
00:22:28 used to be pretty liberal in a lot of ways.
00:22:30 Like, you think...
00:22:32 Like, French women was always, like,
00:22:34 portrayed as conservative, but they did...
00:22:36 They had a lot of, like, Libcuck...
00:22:38 They were not conservative until recently.
00:22:40 Yeah.
00:22:42 Look, I haven't been on the internet
00:22:44 for the longest around here, but I've been...
00:22:46 I think I've probably frequented politics
00:22:48 boards for, like, longer than most people.
00:22:50 Uh, like, so starting
00:22:52 in, like, you know, 2007-ish
00:22:54 I would go to the politics boards, and I'd be the
00:22:56 only non-liberal there every single fucking time.
00:22:58 Sure.
00:23:00 What changed was the social justice war.
00:23:02 That, as far as I can tell, from my own
00:23:04 my own anecdotal perspective,
00:23:06 single-handedly shifted everything.
00:23:08 It's because there were no millennial conservatives
00:23:10 until we had it, until they had an enemy.
00:23:12 It said we, but I'm not one of them.
00:23:14 Right, exactly.
00:23:16 So what it was was, originally, the demographics
00:23:18 on politics, at least on, you know,
00:23:20 pop-media boards where I would go,
00:23:22 I'm sure there was plenty of conservative, dedicated websites,
00:23:24 but, like, you know, like, the tig-w-tig forums
00:23:26 or, like, the escapist forums,
00:23:28 the screw-attack forums, it was always, like,
00:23:30 it was always, the only demographic
00:23:32 politically was just Democrat voting liberals.
00:23:34 Like, generally people who you would describe
00:23:36 as pretty blue-pilled, right?
00:23:38 I guess particularly because I was in gaming communities,
00:23:41 and at that time, it was all about
00:23:43 Jack Thompson and Fox News.
00:23:45 Those were the enemies, both conservatives,
00:23:47 both Republicans, right?
00:23:48 I mean, yeah.
00:23:49 But then gaming started attacking itself
00:23:51 from within, Sarkeesian style,
00:23:53 and all of a sudden, the demographics split wide open.
00:23:56 Now we have far more hardcore liberals,
00:23:59 and then we have the alt-right people
00:24:02 who are still sort of, like, center-right,
00:24:05 because they're not, like, Christian, they're not, like,
00:24:07 fucking, they're not, like, Ted Cruz conservative,
00:24:09 but they're more, like, Trump conservative.
00:24:11 And then it just seems like the whole, like,
00:24:13 blue-pilled, mild-mannered Democratic liberals
00:24:15 just don't even exist among my generation anymore.
00:24:18 It just sort of split those two ways.
00:24:20 What I think happened, because, like,
00:24:22 I grew up super liberal, and, you know,
00:24:24 my mom raised me on, like, political music and stuff,
00:24:28 and back in the 2000s,
00:24:31 the reason that everyone online was liberal
00:24:33 was that being conservative meant being pro-war.
00:24:36 Like, Bush had taken us to war,
00:24:39 and, like, the platform of liberals was anti-war.
00:24:42 We wanted peace, we wanted, and, like, pro-abortion,
00:24:45 pro, like, stuff like that.
00:24:47 But once the war was no longer the big concern,
00:24:50 because, like, well, both sides are equally likely
00:24:53 to go to war, so, like, we don't, like,
00:24:56 now that it's, like, an identitarian conflict,
00:24:58 and, like, there's a whole young generation
00:25:00 who's, like, well, you know, yeah,
00:25:02 we will back the Republicans, because they're not arguing for war.
00:25:05 They're just arguing for not this stuff that we don't like.
00:25:09 Right. No.
00:25:10 Fun fact, I learned from Free Domain Radio,
00:25:12 Barack Obama was the only president in U.S. history,
00:25:16 I believe, unless I misheard this fact,
00:25:18 the only president in U.S. history to have war going on
00:25:21 when he took office and war still continuing when he left office.
00:25:24 You could argue, though, that that's just because, again,
00:25:26 he is, like, a replaceable tool
00:25:28 who was just put in place, and, like, the machinery around him
00:25:30 just continued to operate.
00:25:31 Well, that's it. That's why nobody cares, like,
00:25:33 nobody cares about being liberal anymore,
00:25:35 because it doesn't seem like, it doesn't say,
00:25:38 it doesn't stop anything.
00:25:39 Like, when, like, people were so angry when he, like,
00:25:44 won both elections, like, you know,
00:25:46 you had Eminem making songs about it
00:25:48 and all this shit and all these people,
00:25:49 and then, like, we finally got a Democratic president
00:25:52 and it didn't end the war.
00:25:54 So it's, like, why be Democrat at this point?
00:25:56 Every one of the fucking Nobel Peace Prize,
00:25:58 like, to remind everybody of that.
00:26:00 If I remember correctly, one of the things people wanted
00:26:02 was to stop the drug war, and all Obama did was
00:26:04 minimize mandatory minimum sentences,
00:26:07 but nothing else.
00:26:08 The fucking war on drugs continued completely.
00:26:10 Utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars around the world.
00:26:15 Well, yeah, all that shit continues.
00:26:17 Well, hey, guys, let's...
00:26:19 Yeah, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about,
00:26:21 but listen, guys, let's actually, we've been danced around.
00:26:24 Let's get to the real topic.
00:26:25 The limits of free speech.
00:26:27 Margie, did you want to comment on this?
00:26:29 I just want to say on the subject of the Internet
00:26:31 being more liberal, just something really illuminative
00:26:34 was in the Parkour Dude 91 saga.
00:26:38 Renowned liberal.
00:26:40 One of the main, like, enemies of Parkour Dude 91
00:26:44 was this guy, Fly Away Now,
00:26:46 and Fly Away Now during the legendary trial
00:26:49 of Parkour Dude 91.
00:26:51 One of his main problems was,
00:26:53 Jace, you are racist, and that's not good.
00:26:57 And so he went in hard on critiquing Jace's racism,
00:27:03 which is a thing that I don't think could happen nowadays.
00:27:06 I don't think anyone would...
00:27:08 Would portray a racist...
00:27:10 No, Four Context.
00:27:12 Fly Away Now is a member of a trolling cult.
00:27:15 It's like a four-chan trolling cult.
00:27:17 Was this sincere criticism, or was it a joke?
00:27:20 He's saying that a troll would never use that
00:27:23 as a weapon against somebody now,
00:27:25 because being seen as racist would be seen as like,
00:27:28 that's what the trolls are now,
00:27:30 is that they use racism themselves.
00:27:33 I mean, that's sort of like that guerrilla mindset guy
00:27:36 will call people pedophiles, despite...
00:27:39 And I don't mean to imply that four-chants
00:27:41 never been racist or edgy or anything.
00:27:43 I think there's been undertones of the Scientology activism
00:27:47 and stuff like that, and there's always been
00:27:49 jokes about fucked news or whatever the hell.
00:27:51 So, I don't know.
00:27:53 I just think it's an interesting change in the world.
00:27:55 Yeah, thanks.
00:27:56 So yeah, limits on free speech.
00:27:58 I was talking with that with the wife,
00:28:00 and being all like, oh yeah,
00:28:02 because then there was the obvious yelling fire
00:28:04 in a crowded theater argument,
00:28:06 and she told me, I didn't research this,
00:28:08 I never researched anything because research is bullshit
00:28:10 because everyone says different things.
00:28:12 She said that she's heard that that argument
00:28:14 was concocted during the First World War
00:28:17 to minimize and delegitimize anyone
00:28:20 who protested the war in a crowded theater.
00:28:22 Sorry, which argument is this that was diminished?
00:28:24 The yelling fire in a crowded theater.
00:28:26 Oh, okay, okay.
00:28:27 That they're saying, we need to stop the war.
00:28:29 And then other people are like, you need to be silent.
00:28:31 To which they'd be like, oh, free speech bitch,
00:28:33 this is America.
00:28:34 To which other people said, no,
00:28:36 what you're doing isn't free speech.
00:28:38 It's like yelling fire in a crowded theater.
00:28:41 Well, I mean, okay, let's...
00:28:43 So that's an example of the yelling fire
00:28:45 in a crowded theater where there's some action
00:28:48 that's happening and you're compelling people
00:28:50 to take an action based on false information.
00:28:53 So if there actually was a fire
00:28:55 and you yell fire in a crowded theater,
00:28:57 that is a reasonable thing to do.
00:28:59 It's less about that you can't speak,
00:29:01 but it's more about that you take responsibility
00:29:03 for what happens as a result of the speech.
00:29:05 For example, if you tell someone,
00:29:07 come here for free cupcakes
00:29:09 and then you don't give anyone free cupcakes,
00:29:11 or buy a cake and get a free cupcake,
00:29:14 and then you don't give it.
00:29:16 That's false advertising.
00:29:18 Yeah, that's false advertising.
00:29:20 The difference is that it's not the fact
00:29:22 that you've said the word fire.
00:29:24 Your intention is to sow chaos.
00:29:26 That's true.
00:29:28 Your intention is to make people do bad things.
00:29:30 Unfortunately, when it comes to this,
00:29:32 if someone is just talking to their friend
00:29:34 and they say, yeah, so you know,
00:29:36 me and my friends are gonna have a bonfire tomorrow,
00:29:38 if you say that in a movie theater, obviously you're fine.
00:29:40 If someone says it but just yells the word fire
00:29:42 and starts running around screaming,
00:29:44 different intentions, obviously.
00:29:46 All we can do is we need a court system
00:29:48 to just figure out what was the intention
00:29:50 we had in the court system.
00:29:52 What if the guy was
00:29:54 mentally unsound
00:29:56 and just yelled fire
00:29:58 because that's what he does?
00:30:00 Well, then we just take it case by case.
00:30:02 If he couldn't help it, then we probably
00:30:04 shouldn't let this guy hang out in theaters.
00:30:06 The thing is with free speech is that
00:30:08 if we could take it case by case,
00:30:10 people would prefer that
00:30:12 because it is
00:30:14 a lot of these things,
00:30:16 you can't just ban a word
00:30:18 and have it fix all the problems.
00:30:20 People are gonna find ways to get around it.
00:30:22 There's always gonna be
00:30:24 people
00:30:26 scouting the system and stuff.
00:30:28 We do do it case by case.
00:30:30 That's what the court system is for.
00:30:32 If you scream fire in a theater,
00:30:34 you would go to trial.
00:30:36 People, I guess,
00:30:38 okay.
00:30:40 I don't know anything about anything, actually.
00:30:42 I don't know anything about justice.
00:30:44 I used to think
00:30:46 free speech was like
00:30:48 you can say anything you want
00:30:50 and if people try to silence you, that means they're wrong.
00:30:52 You don't have that in Britain?
00:30:54 That shouldn't be there anymore.
00:30:56 I mean, never was, I don't think.
00:30:58 Free speech is not codified in law.
00:31:00 They do have nowhere near the kind of freedoms
00:31:02 we have in America in Britain.
00:31:04 Okay, well, USA.
00:31:06 For what it's worth.
00:31:08 Wait, I'm sorry.
00:31:10 I think it was finishing this point.
00:31:12 I'm sorry.
00:31:14 I don't know.
00:31:16 I didn't think he had any more point.
00:31:18 I had a bit of a point.
00:31:20 I was trying to rescue him.
00:31:22 The reason that USA
00:31:24 has its first amendment
00:31:26 was because we wanted to protect
00:31:28 your ability to talk shit about the government.
00:31:30 Right, that was the whole point.
00:31:32 We did that.
00:31:34 Talking shit about the government
00:31:36 is how we started the revolution.
00:31:38 That was the whole point was that we
00:31:40 talked their government until everybody got pissed off
00:31:42 and then we fought them and became our own people.
00:31:44 I can do that.
00:31:46 Well, they changed the rules over time.
00:31:48 You can.
00:31:50 They do have freedom of speech in Europe now,
00:31:52 but not
00:31:54 necessarily to the same extent.
00:31:56 Here's what he was thinking about.
00:31:58 When YouTube rolled out its whole
00:32:00 we're going to just bury
00:32:02 videos that are hateful
00:32:04 and racist and misleading and shit.
00:32:06 I remember thinking
00:32:08 that they're saying it's free speech.
00:32:10 You just can't have speech as hateful
00:32:12 and racist.
00:32:14 I think that the whole idea
00:32:16 of the Enlightenment era free speech
00:32:18 revolution is that you can say
00:32:20 anything, even things that are
00:32:22 hateful and harmful.
00:32:24 You can't say things as long as they're nice.
00:32:26 Probably dates back to thousands of years.
00:32:28 The purpose of 10 years in universities
00:32:30 is that professors have the freedom
00:32:32 to pursue academic pursuits
00:32:34 that challenge mainstream ideas
00:32:36 exactly for these kinds of reasons.
00:32:38 Yeah, exactly. I don't get why people are
00:32:40 typically offended when they see something
00:32:42 that contradicts them.
00:32:44 For me, the moment I hear something
00:32:46 that goes against my perception,
00:32:48 I'm fucking excited. It's like my favorite
00:32:50 time of the day. It makes my fucking month.
00:32:52 I personally don't feel
00:32:54 like I have enough ego
00:32:56 to say that I just love
00:32:58 things that fundamentally challenge my world view.
00:33:00 I am a weak human being
00:33:02 who's entrenched in his own biases
00:33:04 like everybody else.
00:33:06 Except for DeVue.
00:33:08 DeVue is the one exception here.
00:33:10 I do want to say DeVue is legitimately an exception.
00:33:12 DeVue legitimately
00:33:14 and not naming. I have watched this man change
00:33:16 his entire mind at the drop
00:33:18 of a fucking pin.
00:33:20 I'm not saying that's necessarily a great thing to do either.
00:33:22 You even were able to accept your fucking
00:33:24 incorrect fucking metaphor
00:33:26 in an idiom fusion that you do.
00:33:28 You were able to fix yourself on that.
00:33:30 Congratulations.
00:33:32 To put a point on it, this is the question.
00:33:34 Is hate speech
00:33:36 free speech?
00:33:38 That's the biggest question right now.
00:33:40 I think definitely yes
00:33:42 because
00:33:44 hate speech is determined
00:33:46 by the people who are getting offended.
00:33:48 That's right.
00:33:50 Let's say, for example, if
00:33:52 in a liberal government
00:33:54 liberals
00:33:56 they would change
00:33:58 the law in some way
00:34:00 and it would be like, okay,
00:34:02 if you cause offense you're going to jail
00:34:04 and then somewhere down the line
00:34:06 the people who put that law in place
00:34:08 are now technically offensive
00:34:10 to a majority that's sprung up
00:34:12 and then they would go to jail
00:34:14 and it just feels like a stupid thing to put into place.
00:34:16 The idea that
00:34:18 some sort of vague
00:34:20 because it's an ever-shifting
00:34:22 what is offensive to who
00:34:24 depends on who's around and how many of them there are.
00:34:26 That's true.
00:34:28 Should the government be in the business of determining
00:34:30 what's hate speech and what's not?
00:34:32 Ben, if you want to comment, feel free.
00:34:34 You can't base law on opinions.
00:34:36 I guess you kind of can.
00:34:38 You know what?
00:34:40 I think the problem is that
00:34:42 people are so worried about
00:34:44 the type of speech
00:34:46 instead of where it's being used.
00:34:48 Let's say I have a private blog
00:34:52 where I am constantly
00:34:54 saying racist shit
00:34:56 and I just share it with my friends.
00:34:58 Let's say it's on Facebook.
00:35:00 If Facebook finds this thing
00:35:02 they're going to delete it
00:35:04 because it's against their policy
00:35:06 even though it's private and it's just among me and friends
00:35:08 and it's not aggressing against anyone
00:35:10 it's just me expressing my beliefs
00:35:12 that are extremely unpopular
00:35:14 and even if I personally think
00:35:16 people shouldn't have the beliefs that
00:35:18 this person has, why am I the moral authority?
00:35:20 That's against the policy
00:35:22 on what we built this country on
00:35:24 that no one has moral authority.
00:35:26 That's the point.
00:35:28 How about fucking Hulk Hogan
00:35:30 who just was filmed
00:35:32 against his will?
00:35:34 He said the word nigger in private
00:35:36 to someone.
00:35:38 Watch Jesse's video
00:35:40 for the full discussion of that.
00:35:42 I've been curious about this
00:35:44 but I couldn't really find
00:35:46 a definitive answer
00:35:48 and I was also scared of googling it
00:35:50 in case the Google comes to get me.
00:35:52 Is it
00:35:54 illegal to be racist
00:35:56 just actually?
00:35:58 No, not in America.
00:36:00 Absolutely not.
00:36:02 You can be as racist as you like
00:36:04 but if you say anything
00:36:06 then it becomes a problem.
00:36:08 I want to as an example
00:36:10 lay a ground rule of something I think
00:36:12 and I want to hear you guys' opinion on this
00:36:14 because to me
00:36:16 I've always taken free speech and everything
00:36:18 really in life as the rule
00:36:20 of I can swing my fist as much
00:36:22 as I want but if I hit your face
00:36:24 then it's a problem basically.
00:36:26 That was one of the founding fathers said
00:36:28 that I don't remember who.
00:36:30 That was the idea of
00:36:32 what the law was based on in this country
00:36:34 was that you can do
00:36:36 literally whatever you want but the second that it
00:36:38 hurts somebody else, that's when you're in trouble.
00:36:40 The problem is what constitutes violence
00:36:42 does need to be.
00:36:44 The problem also is that like
00:36:46 where is the line on personal responsibility
00:36:48 if I am writing a blog
00:36:50 that's like I hate black people
00:36:52 the blog, at what point
00:36:54 is it that I am aggressing you
00:36:56 by writing things that offend black people
00:36:58 and at what point it is yeah but you chose
00:37:00 to read it. Now if I was
00:37:02 let's say that I
00:37:04 go on someone's blog
00:37:06 and this is a personal blog and I think
00:37:08 that internet websites
00:37:10 that you own should be respected as
00:37:12 private property. Of course
00:37:14 private property. That you invite people on to
00:37:16 essentially because I mean you pay for it
00:37:18 you literally buy hosting, you buy a domain
00:37:20 it's your intellectual property
00:37:22 you have control over what gets posted there
00:37:24 let's say that you
00:37:26 get someone who's like
00:37:28 I'm a black writer and this guy
00:37:30 is calling me a nigger every day
00:37:32 in my comments so I P-ban him
00:37:34 this guy creates
00:37:36 a new account on a new computer, shows up again
00:37:38 and continues doing it
00:37:40 at that point I would consider this an act of
00:37:42 aggression. Like this
00:37:44 person has been not only are they
00:37:46 doing something that they know is offensive
00:37:48 they've been told that it's offensive
00:37:50 they've been kicked off the platform
00:37:52 and they've circumvented the system
00:37:54 in order to find a way to continue
00:37:56 fucking with me. At this point there's nothing
00:37:58 I can do because this person's gotten around
00:38:00 the tools that I have at my disposal
00:38:02 to defend myself so this is where
00:38:04 I should be able to say to the police
00:38:06 hey this guy is like
00:38:08 creating multiple accounts to
00:38:10 continue a harassment campaign against me
00:38:12 this is clearly harassment
00:38:14 I think I would agree
00:38:16 Internet harassment in general is something that
00:38:18 where harassment becomes not free
00:38:20 speech that is sort of a line under itself
00:38:22 which is part of the reason I wanted to start this podcast
00:38:24 for but also in general
00:38:26 people do need to understand
00:38:28 that internet harassment is real
00:38:30 harassment for the simple fact that
00:38:32 when you get a message from someone
00:38:34 that's directed at you
00:38:36 do you think
00:38:38 hmm those are some slightly
00:38:40 less colored pixels on this screen
00:38:42 forming words that mean nothing
00:38:44 or do you think
00:38:46 hmm a person
00:38:48 has said a thing
00:38:50 to me. Well that was
00:38:52 what I was trying to say earlier like I used to
00:38:54 like when I was a young boy I was all
00:38:56 for like free speech means you
00:38:58 can say whatever you want in like
00:39:00 no nothing should be banned
00:39:02 and you should be able to say whatever you like
00:39:04 but like as the years go on
00:39:06 I do recognize that
00:39:08 there's nuance to all things
00:39:10 and especially this
00:39:12 the context and the intent
00:39:14 is very important to understand in any situation
00:39:16 yep
00:39:18 let's say you have a number of friends
00:39:20 let's say you have like almost all of your friends
00:39:22 however many you have if you have none imagine you have
00:39:24 12 friends imagine if 10 of your friends
00:39:26 sent you a letter
00:39:28 all saying that they don't want to be your friend anymore
00:39:30 and they hate you and they list
00:39:32 very specific things that you actually
00:39:34 do do as to why they hate you now
00:39:36 will you think
00:39:38 hmm this is some ink arranged
00:39:40 in shapes that I can identify
00:39:42 as words or are you going to be stressed
00:39:44 out and upset so there you go
00:39:46 speech can be
00:39:48 like people saying things
00:39:50 and meaning things
00:39:52 and having harmful intents
00:39:54 can constitute the building
00:39:56 blocks that can create the bridge of harassment
00:39:58 and it can be done even without words
00:40:00 or physical activity
00:40:02 just with digital information being transferred
00:40:04 to your computer it still counts as
00:40:06 real communication that's why people go on social media
00:40:08 all the time
00:40:10 I feel like I understand
00:40:12 why a lot of young people
00:40:14 like on the internet they get up in arms
00:40:16 about like their ability to say
00:40:18 whatever they want regardless of
00:40:20 how it may affect others
00:40:22 because of the fact that they're young and they
00:40:24 all they know about like
00:40:26 incorrect language is swear words
00:40:28 and the fact that in school it is cool
00:40:30 among friends to say swear words
00:40:32 because the teachers don't let you
00:40:34 and I feel like that they take that
00:40:36 idea of like
00:40:38 not allowed to say
00:40:40 and then they just extend it into
00:40:42 like internet interactions
00:40:44 without knowing that it actually hurts people
00:40:46 that's a very good
00:40:48 so I mean
00:40:50 I think that we could go back and forth on these
00:40:52 details all day but I think the reason
00:40:54 why there's no like hard
00:40:56 agreement why there hasn't been an answer to this question
00:40:58 is because the reality is
00:41:00 like
00:41:02 the vagueness of this topic
00:41:04 makes it basically unsolvable
00:41:06 except with some vast network of specific
00:41:08 investigation into each
00:41:10 you know individual
00:41:12 time what happens
00:41:14 which it should be yeah that's what the government
00:41:16 should be
00:41:18 a body that exists to
00:41:20 solve individual problems
00:41:22 that we have but because
00:41:24 of the fact that this first of all country
00:41:26 is way too fucking big second of all everything
00:41:28 is industrialized that's the entire way we think
00:41:30 of the country is mass production and like
00:41:32 we just try to have everybody follow
00:41:34 the same broad set of rules that
00:41:36 just doesn't work for
00:41:38 300 million people living across
00:41:40 3000 miles of fucking
00:41:42 land like it doesn't make
00:41:44 sense to hold everybody to the same exact
00:41:46 standards and circumstances all the time
00:41:48 you guys already don't
00:41:50 yeah
00:41:52 you guys okay there's this one example of one
00:41:54 website that does internet interaction
00:41:56 very interestingly
00:41:58 new grounds so on new grounds
00:42:00 you know the interaction
00:42:02 is pretty limited you have forums you have
00:42:04 direct messages and you have
00:42:06 reviews right it's
00:42:08 for the pretty standard you know early internet
00:42:10 package but on reviews you can review
00:42:12 a movie you can review a game
00:42:14 and once you've done the review the review is done
00:42:16 I don't think you can edit reviews
00:42:18 I don't think they've ever added in the edit
00:42:20 feature and
00:42:22 a the artist who
00:42:24 uploaded the thing that you are reviewing
00:42:26 can respond to you by making
00:42:28 a creators response a single
00:42:30 creators response that they themselves
00:42:32 cannot edit and once they
00:42:34 have written their response
00:42:36 it's done and new grounds has
00:42:38 responded to the tons of requests
00:42:40 they've gotten to be able to respond
00:42:42 to their responses
00:42:44 to which new grounds has said
00:42:46 our philosophy is to give
00:42:48 the creator the last word
00:42:50 and I think you know
00:42:52 if that were a thing that were practiced
00:42:54 voluntarily
00:42:56 I think that that would solve a lot of harassment issues
00:42:58 sort of like someone
00:43:00 you want to criticize some person on the internet
00:43:02 you know like where does it cross the line
00:43:04 from criticism to harassment you know
00:43:06 maybe you just come in
00:43:08 you make your point you don't be
00:43:10 a huge dick about it
00:43:12 once you've gotten your fucking
00:43:14 point out and then they've made their response
00:43:16 maybe you give it a little bit of follow up
00:43:18 there and then you move the fuck
00:43:20 on that's sort of what I under
00:43:22 that's what I see as the pattern with these people
00:43:24 who like get so harassed they have to like go
00:43:26 fucking therapy and shit start taking pills
00:43:28 it's that they might very legitimately
00:43:30 fuck up on something right
00:43:32 as a content creator they might actually hurt
00:43:34 people and they get called out on it
00:43:36 and now they have to deal with it but then
00:43:38 they never stop getting
00:43:40 called out on it they have been forever
00:43:42 banished damned to the land
00:43:44 of weeping and gnashing of tweets
00:43:46 I've been planning to to launch
00:43:48 a series for a long time
00:43:50 and I think I might finally do it sometime
00:43:52 soon because I'm ready I've got the mental
00:43:54 wherewithal to do this but I want
00:43:56 to do a streaming series
00:43:58 called digi bro takes on takes
00:44:00 all comers and I'm just going to make
00:44:02 a discord server that
00:44:04 has an open season
00:44:06 like like you know
00:44:08 call line like anybody can join this
00:44:10 server anybody can jump in the call
00:44:12 but I will only activate one person at a
00:44:14 time and the idea is
00:44:16 if you have any problem with me
00:44:18 come into this call and let's
00:44:20 argue about it until you
00:44:22 sound either you we've resolved
00:44:24 your issue or you are
00:44:26 repeating yourself and sound like an idiot
00:44:28 and need to be kicked out because the audience
00:44:30 has decided that they don't want to hear you anymore
00:44:32 you say that you can
00:44:34 identify a terrible or good anime
00:44:36 in just one episode
00:44:38 but you also say there's no such thing
00:44:40 as an objective opinion
00:44:42 this is a contradiction
00:44:44 because reasons
00:44:46 what about
00:44:48 what about
00:44:50 what about food
00:44:52 reviews I think those should be
00:44:54 illegal I don't think those should
00:44:56 I think those should not be comfortable
00:44:58 we have the only good food review
00:45:00 show ever created on the face of the planet
00:45:02 we have the real people clamor for
00:45:04 well
00:45:06 I think
00:45:08 it's discrimination against
00:45:10 against bad food
00:45:12 because
00:45:14 it's wasting food and we all know
00:45:16 people should be allowed
00:45:18 any
00:45:20 dissenting opinion because I'm pretty sure
00:45:22 all of us feel the exact same way
00:45:24 I think food reviews are fine
00:45:26 not that
00:45:28 not that
00:45:30 I'm about to qualify it
00:45:32 that's not the issue here
00:45:34 it's just people shouldn't
00:45:36 be allowed to find a recipe
00:45:38 and then do it wrong and then give the recipe
00:45:40 a bad review on the internet
00:45:42 because they fucking it up
00:45:44 they decided
00:45:46 to put fucking olive oil
00:45:48 in their french onion soup
00:45:50 and it's not my fault it's greasy
00:45:52 you fuck
00:45:54 that's a reasonable
00:45:56 it's not my fault
00:45:58 fucking soup lover
00:46:00 you make a reasonable point
00:46:02 about how everyone's voice
00:46:04 seems equally valid
00:46:06 unfortunately online
00:46:08 at some point
00:46:10 at some point I realized
00:46:12 I think it was probably in the t-bap days
00:46:14 at some point I realized
00:46:16 that a huge percentage of the people commenting
00:46:18 especially on YouTube
00:46:20 are kids and I was like wait a minute
00:46:22 wait a minute
00:46:24 these aren't full people
00:46:26 I don't need to think
00:46:28 I don't necessarily need to give
00:46:30 these opinions
00:46:32 being expressed in the comments
00:46:34 the weight that I would to an actual
00:46:36 you just caught on to that
00:46:38 I caught on to that back then
00:46:40 I had this realization at some point
00:46:42 in my YouTube career
00:46:44 my default kind of thing to do when I
00:46:46 read a comment is always to project
00:46:48 my situation onto them
00:46:50 they are the same age as me
00:46:52 they are the same intellectual level
00:46:54 we gotta avoid that though
00:46:56 I imagine that
00:46:58 every commenter I respond to
00:47:00 I just think
00:47:02 this is a dumb 12 year old
00:47:04 even if it's a good commenter who I love
00:47:06 I just think
00:47:08 or an amazing 9 year old
00:47:10 yeah
00:47:12 anyone who leaves me
00:47:14 constant loving comments
00:47:16 about how great I am
00:47:18 nobody can be this big of a fan of me
00:47:20 if you're above the age of 12
00:47:22 if they're someone who bashes on me
00:47:24 I'm like no one can care this much about
00:47:26 shitting on an internet creator unless they're 12
00:47:28 as Endless just said
00:47:30 in fact it is true that most of these people
00:47:32 are kids the problem is that some of these kids
00:47:34 are 35 years old
00:47:36 now I will say I found one of them
00:47:38 in person recently
00:47:40 I mean I assume I'm being pretty discriminatory
00:47:42 but someone who I'm pretty sure is an internet
00:47:44 commenter
00:47:46 I passed them on the side
00:47:48 he just looked like
00:47:50 you know he was gonna
00:47:52 comment
00:47:54 he was all geared up to go back to his house
00:47:56 the tips of his finger
00:47:58 his fingers were weathered
00:48:00 guys he was wearing a cod shirt
00:48:02 so that's a pretty good sign
00:48:04 so he's like probably 5 foot 6 or so
00:48:06 you know stout portly
00:48:08 like a really squished looking face
00:48:10 he's got that sort of like
00:48:12 shaved head thing but he doesn't shave it
00:48:14 consistently
00:48:16 you're just describing every 35 year old
00:48:18 youtube commenter that I've met
00:48:20 exactly
00:48:22 and he has like you know dinky little glasses
00:48:24 and he just sort of walks with like a little bit
00:48:26 you know just kind of like walks a little bit
00:48:28 goofily and most importantly
00:48:30 of all he's wearing a call of duty ghost
00:48:32 shirt which is like the least popular call of duty
00:48:34 so I'm just like oh yeah
00:48:36 this is a guy who like has some specific opinions
00:48:38 and I'm just like yeah
00:48:40 Davoo cradles
00:48:42 his chin and his fingers
00:48:44 this is a guy
00:48:46 this guy thinks individual thoughts
00:48:48 individual ideas
00:48:50 the mad man
00:48:52 if it was a modern warfare 3 shirt
00:48:54 I'd be like okay he could just be a normie gamer
00:48:56 but a ghost shirt that's too specific
00:48:58 so I can feel
00:49:00 the opinions coming from him
00:49:02 what if he's just a normal guy
00:49:04 doing his normal programming job
00:49:06 and he just really liked modern warfare
00:49:08 and he pre-ordered ghost because he was super hype
00:49:10 and didn't know he thought the dog was gonna be dope
00:49:12 but he's wearing it right now
00:49:14 because he spent a lot of money
00:49:16 like special edition that came with the shirt
00:49:18 and he just I gotta get my money's worth
00:49:20 this is just how I'm wired dad taught me
00:49:22 to use everything I spent my money on
00:49:24 I feel like that way about certain shirts
00:49:26 but I wear them indoors
00:49:28 wait so did Davoo talk to a guy or not
00:49:30 yeah what happened
00:49:32 okay I gotta tell you about my guy who's similar
00:49:34 at the airport
00:49:36 yeah you tweeted about this man
00:49:38 for anybody who missed my tweets this was legendary
00:49:40 so me and May
00:49:42 were at the airport going back to
00:49:44 Rochester
00:49:46 from my hometown Virginia Beach
00:49:48 and like just some random college dude
00:49:50 had sat across from us
00:49:52 and was asking about my shirt
00:49:54 because I was wearing a Gintama shirt and he thought it was a bleach shirt
00:49:56 and I was explaining
00:49:58 I was explaining to him that it was a parody of
00:50:00 bleach and he was just like
00:50:02 he just got like oh you guys into anime
00:50:04 and she was like yeah we're anime
00:50:06 YouTubers we're like it's our job
00:50:08 we always do is watch anime
00:50:10 we get into this whole anime
00:50:12 so we're talking to this guy for a while
00:50:14 we're making him a fan basically he's like
00:50:16 way excited to hear about anime
00:50:18 he's like a 20 year old college dude
00:50:20 but there's another guy
00:50:22 who's like sitting across the way
00:50:24 who's like a big fat guy
00:50:26 in a Ninja Turtles t-shirt
00:50:28 when we had first gotten
00:50:30 to the airport terminal I saw this guy
00:50:32 and I thought if anyone here would recognize me
00:50:34 it would be that guy it's like what I'm thinking
00:50:36 when I look at this guy
00:50:38 so we're just talking about anime
00:50:40 for like probably 15 minutes
00:50:42 and then everybody gets up to go in the line
00:50:44 and the fat guy comes over and he's like
00:50:46 hey I heard you guys talking about anime
00:50:48 you know I wasn't sure if I should jump into the conversation
00:50:50 or whatever right
00:50:52 and he's like yeah I'm like
00:50:54 okay so the other dude like clearly had been
00:50:56 watching like everything on crunchyroll
00:50:58 just like whatever showed up on crunchyroll
00:51:00 he was giving it a shot this fat guy has just seen
00:51:02 I fucking hate people that watch anime
00:51:04 this fat guy has just
00:51:06 exclusively seen Attack on Titan
00:51:08 and that is it but he comes up
00:51:10 and he's like yeah you know
00:51:12 I really like I was really into death note
00:51:14 you know because I think
00:51:16 it's like a perfect mirror reflection of like
00:51:18 the Lion King
00:51:20 because you know
00:51:22 what the fuck
00:51:24 and then he's like well because you know first
00:51:26 he's like each character is like parallel
00:51:28 so first you've got like light who wants to be
00:51:30 god just like Simba
00:51:32 and after he said that
00:51:34 my brain went like
00:51:36 like all the juice drained out
00:51:38 and I was just like dumbfounded like
00:51:40 I was trying not to look at him as hard as I could
00:51:42 he's like
00:51:44 I think Ryuk was Rafiki and like
00:51:46 I mean he just
00:51:48 basically he just compared the main characters
00:51:50 of one to the main characters of others
00:51:52 like light is or L is just like scar
00:51:54 because he wants to stop Simba
00:51:56 like
00:51:58 that's the
00:52:00 mark of a great story
00:52:02 is that it's exactly like another story
00:52:04 Simba is like L
00:52:06 because he's trying to stop Scar
00:52:08 who's the bad evil man who took over
00:52:10 and seized power through illegitimate
00:52:12 evil means like he's the one
00:52:14 but L doesn't want to be god
00:52:16 Scar doesn't want to be god
00:52:18 Scar
00:52:20 is kind of does
00:52:22 I'm sorry
00:52:24 this just reminds me of a time I was in an anime convention
00:52:26 where I went up to a guy wearing a samurai outfit
00:52:28 and I was like hey dude your gene
00:52:30 I love samurai shampoo and he's like actually I'm going
00:52:32 on from uh you know fucking
00:52:34 loop in the third and I pretended
00:52:36 I knew who that was at the time
00:52:38 oh you didn't know who Gaimon was
00:52:40 I didn't know who the fuck that was at the time
00:52:42 this was this was long ago but it's I've never
00:52:44 forgotten it I've always been ashamed
00:52:46 there's nothing worse that to your credit than getting
00:52:48 a thing wrong
00:52:50 especially getting like a classic wrong
00:52:52 for like a modern show
00:52:54 like he looks disgusted when I said I love gene
00:52:56 yeah it's so cool
00:52:58 at that one party
00:53:00 that I went to when I was at your house
00:53:02 we met that one guy who went to
00:53:04 some like anime cons right
00:53:06 embarrassing
00:53:08 I don't what did he look like I don't remember
00:53:10 he was a bizarre
00:53:12 he was a bizarre like lantern
00:53:14 looking motherfucker
00:53:16 he looked like some sort of like
00:53:18 portly like last lantern
00:53:20 like the pokemon lantern
00:53:22 I don't know what you're talking about
00:53:24 there's a lot of people that could fit that description
00:53:26 he was talking to us about how he went to cons
00:53:28 in the local area
00:53:30 he was a big anime guy
00:53:32 and then I said yeah me and Ben are like
00:53:34 stars of brony con we go there all the time
00:53:36 yeah
00:53:38 I wish you had
00:53:40 I'm just picturing lantern the pokemon
00:53:42 just like hey guys we're going to an anime convention
00:53:44 I do not recall that conversation even a little bit
00:53:46 so okay so first amendment right
00:53:48 there's one thing about that
00:53:50 I don't care about that anymore
00:53:52 it's been a thing for me right
00:53:54 let's just do another wild card episode
00:53:56 what I think is
00:53:58 one of the most widely held fallacies
00:54:00 about specifically
00:54:02 the first amendment of the constitution of the united states
00:54:04 is this fallacy that
00:54:06 this is going to like
00:54:08 ugh I'm tensed up because I could get all y'all
00:54:10 fucking jumping on my ass over this
00:54:12 this perception that
00:54:14 the first amendment
00:54:16 only applies to
00:54:18 units of individual solitary
00:54:20 people
00:54:22 as opposed to like corporations and what not
00:54:24 well here's the thing about that right
00:54:26 because the actual text
00:54:28 of the first amendment is
00:54:30 well hold on I'll just
00:54:32 probably should have looked it up before
00:54:34 first amendment
00:54:36 what it says is
00:54:38 I gotta keep fucking coughing to get to it
00:54:40 for score yeah okay
00:54:42 Congress shall make no law
00:54:44 respecting an establishment of religion
00:54:46 or prohibiting the free exercise
00:54:48 thereof
00:54:50 or abridging the freedom of speech
00:54:52 or
00:54:54 of the press
00:54:56 or the right of the people to peaceably assemble
00:54:58 and to petition the government for our readdressive grievances
00:55:00 that is a part
00:55:02 like a certain like
00:55:04 comma section and no one ever talks about when they talk about
00:55:06 the idea of free speech basically there's this idea that
00:55:08 if people band together to form a corporation
00:55:10 they've now voided
00:55:12 their ability to speak because it's no longer a person
00:55:14 now it's a company
00:55:16 well that I don't think that press clause
00:55:18 really covers like corporations it covers
00:55:20 the press well it says the press
00:55:22 which basically means like
00:55:24 people who report information in the news
00:55:26 group of people who say things right that's not
00:55:28 like what a corporation is a corporation
00:55:30 is a business a money making enterprise
00:55:32 I mean if you want to argue that a person
00:55:34 you know should be treated like
00:55:36 you know if a company should have the rights of free speech
00:55:38 that's probably fine I just don't think that clause
00:55:40 addresses that yeah well no one
00:55:42 ever no one ever brings it up though like
00:55:44 like we always like doesn't come up
00:55:46 when people say freedom of the press isn't that
00:55:48 exactly what they're talking about
00:55:50 yeah but people don't really think about it right
00:55:52 because you hear people say like oh well a corporation isn't a person
00:55:54 therefore they don't have free speech
00:55:56 it's god damn it that part is not about corporations
00:55:58 it's about the god damn press
00:56:00 I know but like
00:56:02 the press isn't a person
00:56:04 yeah it's the press it's not
00:56:06 okay I'm sorry what do you get
00:56:08 because my feeling is that like you know
00:56:10 if you team up with someone
00:56:12 like even the PCP isn't incorporated
00:56:14 but it's not a person it's a group of multiple people
00:56:16 right so I don't know it's just kind of like
00:56:18 for me I just think of that as sort of a fallacy that people need to
00:56:20 like I wish that
00:56:22 like the way that
00:56:24 publicly traded corporations work
00:56:26 is obviously very very
00:56:28 problematic and really should be looked at
00:56:30 but then I just feel like people sort of throw out
00:56:32 like the entire every single baby
00:56:34 with that particular bathwater you know what I mean
00:56:36 I think I know what you're getting at you're talking about like
00:56:38 people walk around as though if you don't represent
00:56:40 a single person then you don't
00:56:42 really have the right to of
00:56:44 expression I don't
00:56:46 here's a here's a here's a thought about this so for example
00:56:48 Chick-fil-A just fucking
00:56:50 loves Jesus down to their
00:56:52 like you know Chick-fil-A doesn't
00:56:54 want to give like their their female employees like birth control
00:56:56 and whatever there was like a thing about that
00:56:58 because they like
00:57:00 the text they say is we have a sincerely
00:57:02 held belief that like we are
00:57:04 like a religious organization this is a fundamental
00:57:06 principle of us and this goes against
00:57:08 our religious beliefs and we don't want to be forced
00:57:10 to do things that go against our beliefs and
00:57:12 like I could understand someone
00:57:14 being skeptical especially like an atheist who's
00:57:16 like well that's obviously just a trick
00:57:18 to like get away with you know
00:57:20 just not having to spend more on their
00:57:22 employees but the thing is I am
00:57:24 100% convinced that Chick-fil-A
00:57:26 is 100% sincere
00:57:28 about their love of Jesus and
00:57:30 even though I don't think he's you know real or whatever
00:57:32 I mean you know the
00:57:34 thing about Chick-fil-A they close on Sunday man
00:57:36 they cut off profits one seventh of the
00:57:38 week you would think
00:57:40 that that would be unpopular
00:57:42 you would think that they would get a lot of
00:57:44 backlash for that and they do
00:57:46 but the thing is there is a large population
00:57:48 of people who sincerely agree with them
00:57:50 they might be in the minority I don't know
00:57:52 they might be but there's enough of them
00:57:54 that like the goodwill generated within that
00:57:56 population like more than
00:57:58 makes up for the fact that there are lots of people
00:58:00 and lots of people don't want to eat their
00:58:02 shit because they're you know terrible
00:58:04 you're just you're appealed to your demographic
00:58:06 that's like good business
00:58:08 I don't think they're doing themselves any favors
00:58:10 really by like because they really
00:58:12 are putting themselves in the camp of like a small
00:58:14 minority I would argue like
00:58:16 I guess I don't know the statistics
00:58:18 there's like three quarters
00:58:20 there's a lot of religious people in American
00:58:22 most Christians are atheists in denial
00:58:24 I would argue especially in America
00:58:26 most atheists are Christians
00:58:32 why do you refuse to
00:58:34 love God yet you know exist
00:58:36 and you've chosen to just hate
00:58:38 the thing about refusing
00:58:40 birth control right I think my dad
00:58:42 actually agrees on me with this position
00:58:44 even if a little bit like begrudgingly
00:58:46 which is I think it's
00:58:48 in general bullshit that you
00:58:50 have to give employees like
00:58:52 certain things unilaterally
00:58:54 like what happens to just oh you want
00:58:56 this job here's what we'll offer you
00:58:58 maybe it's money maybe it's healthcare
00:59:00 maybe it's this handshake agreement done
00:59:02 I mean I think both of us
00:59:04 the fact is
00:59:06 where the fuck were all these Christians
00:59:08 like protesting the idea of
00:59:10 you have to give every employee a certain amount of healthcare
00:59:12 a certain amount of dental based on certain you know random
00:59:14 bullshit back before it became
00:59:16 religiously controversial right
00:59:18 like Christians should have been on their fucking toes
00:59:20 to realize oh shit if we're allowing
00:59:22 way back in like the FDR
00:59:24 and LBJ era for
00:59:26 the government to force you to give certain things
00:59:28 to your employees that could be turned
00:59:30 against us I don't think they did back then though
00:59:32 I think that the reason it's become an issue
00:59:34 is because like as things
00:59:36 move in a more progressive direction
00:59:38 in some aspects of American life
00:59:40 like the idea of how contraception
00:59:42 should be because it's like you know
00:59:44 you can make an argument it's part of women's biology
00:59:46 and healthcare now they've added on
00:59:48 yeah now they've added on birth control
00:59:50 and like abortion onto it
00:59:52 well I don't think it's wrong
00:59:54 I don't think you should be able to have a get out of
00:59:56 get out of benefit
00:59:58 free clause because you don't believe in abortion
01:00:00 I just feel like everyone shouldn't have to be
01:00:02 giving certain people certain things outside of
01:00:04 like a simple contract
01:00:06 between employer and employer
01:00:08 I mean me personally I don't think
01:00:10 any company should be giving contraception
01:00:12 because like it's not a mandatory thing
01:00:14 like don't fucking
01:00:16 yeah like abstinence is 100% effective
01:00:18 you know I mean that's
01:00:20 I don't know
01:00:22 I mean if it's that's like
01:00:24 if that's a thing that would be covered by health insurance
01:00:26 like birth control is
01:00:28 is covered by health insurance and jobs
01:00:30 provide health insurance so why wouldn't
01:00:32 I know this is an extreme example but just for the
01:00:34 for the intelligent
01:00:36 reflection of this principle
01:00:38 it's like so like what if I am one of
01:00:40 these people who what do they call them the people who are like
01:00:42 into getting viruses and into getting diseases
01:00:44 bug catchers
01:00:46 I don't know
01:00:48 I'm sorry bug chasers
01:00:50 if I'm a bug chaser and let's just say
01:00:52 that I go get AIDS because I really want
01:00:54 AIDS and I'm into that like is it
01:00:56 then the company's responsibility to pay
01:00:58 for that because now it's
01:01:00 a medical issue
01:01:02 and it just did the same way I would argue
01:01:04 that you have exactly as much agency
01:01:06 to not have a child and need
01:01:08 you know an abort you know
01:01:10 contraception or whatever
01:01:12 well I know it's
01:01:14 I don't know you have
01:01:16 agency in lots of things like
01:01:18 why does that mean that it shouldn't be covered by health insurance
01:01:20 this is the real point though I'm with
01:01:22 DeVoo and I'm really libertarian I just think
01:01:24 basically companies just shouldn't do it they shouldn't
01:01:26 be in the business of like giving health care
01:01:28 it should just be everyone's job I don't like
01:01:30 the way that health insurance
01:01:32 is set up I don't like that you have to
01:01:34 work for a company so that
01:01:36 someone will pay for you to get
01:01:38 like just give me the money I think it should
01:01:40 just be available well I think it should
01:01:42 I mean I think it should be universal and I think everyone should
01:01:44 have access to whether you fucking work for a corporation
01:01:46 young people working at entry level jobs
01:01:48 or trying to get jobs in the first place
01:01:50 ever notice how you're totally dependent
01:01:52 on your fucking job for your fucking health care
01:01:54 and you're definitely on your fucking insurance company
01:01:56 and your hospital to get the right care
01:01:58 and you're responsible on your government to be able to
01:02:00 take care of all your shit maybe there's a reason
01:02:02 why politicians love to talk about how you
01:02:04 should give people more fucking health care
01:02:06 because it makes you more dependent
01:02:08 I just want to point out that about
01:02:10 this probably applies to lots of health care issues
01:02:12 but about birth control specifically
01:02:14 like birth control is cheap
01:02:16 and children are expensive and like
01:02:18 really like everybody wins
01:02:20 like everybody wins if people have easy
01:02:22 access to birth control
01:02:24 like that's not I don't think
01:02:26 like I think that that I think that providing that
01:02:28 service pays for itself like a hundred
01:02:30 it's only it's just that is a real practical
01:02:32 concern that I am very sympathetic to
01:02:34 but it's just that when we do that it then
01:02:36 opens up the door to this like this
01:02:38 Chick-fil-A type situations where
01:02:40 things get messy because they really
01:02:42 religiously have a problem with doing
01:02:44 so who wins
01:02:46 right
01:02:48 Christian Baker
01:02:50 being requested to make a gay wedding cake
01:02:52 thing I just wait I just want to
01:02:54 say that I really think the problem here is with
01:02:56 like the fact that health insurance is like
01:02:58 a corporate responsibility
01:03:00 I think that's where the trouble comes in I mean you
01:03:02 can get health care outside I mean I
01:03:04 never have so I don't really
01:03:06 know I'll find out when I quit my job one of these
01:03:08 days but
01:03:10 yeah that sound like your boss
01:03:12 haha
01:03:14 someone was just making a transition it was a topic
01:03:16 interesting yeah it was
01:03:18 Baker being requested to make a gay wedding
01:03:20 yeah oh that's a good one
01:03:22 do they have to now here's my dad
01:03:24 okay my dad I didn't clarify this my dad's
01:03:26 like a super Christian guy got lots of like
01:03:28 degrees in Bible he's like he's about to go on
01:03:30 like a short missions trip actually where's it going
01:03:32 where's it going
01:03:34 well I thought it might be like you
01:03:36 like you got there or something
01:03:38 okay fine fine so
01:03:40 he's going to my house
01:03:42 like one of the fucking trolls
01:03:44 it's going to go down into like central
01:03:46 some some fan
01:03:48 some fan
01:03:50 some fan in like Zimbabwe
01:03:52 listening
01:03:54 he's like hey are you Davoo's dad
01:03:56 I like the difference in like
01:03:58 laxness
01:04:00 that we fucking have on this show we have
01:04:02 Davoo who's just like I can't dox
01:04:04 my dad's where he's going on like the mission
01:04:06 for the church and then
01:04:08 Digi's like Virginia Beach my hometown
01:04:10 you know
01:04:12 that's out there that's out there
01:04:14 I don't think a town is doxing
01:04:16 he muted himself
01:04:18 okay he's probably been trying to say stuff
01:04:20 for getting him muted himself well maybe anyway
01:04:22 so my dad did just muted himself
01:04:24 oh my god
01:04:26 you know it's just common courtesy to
01:04:28 accept custom from people right
01:04:30 so like he'll clean a gay person's
01:04:32 windows for example right no no problem
01:04:34 there right but he thinks
01:04:36 baking that's like
01:04:38 artistic expression right making a
01:04:40 cake make an argument yeah is like
01:04:42 something that comes from more from your soul
01:04:44 right and just exist
01:04:46 but yeah where like I totally
01:04:48 feel that way too I thought I think it's
01:04:50 ridiculous that like
01:04:52 that you have to be
01:04:54 forced to uphold any kind of
01:04:56 like right societal
01:04:58 moral standard that is like the whole
01:05:00 point of freedom of speech to me
01:05:02 is that like and freedom
01:05:04 of to be able to do whatever you want
01:05:06 with your corporation is like I think
01:05:08 everybody's just a pundit for the world
01:05:10 that they want right like
01:05:12 that we all exist
01:05:14 to try to promote the world that we want
01:05:16 to live in and like most
01:05:18 of us disagree with each other about the
01:05:20 specifics of that world like the
01:05:22 amount that we agree on is where we've
01:05:24 drawn the lines in our country like
01:05:26 the lines in the sand is where we've like we all agree
01:05:28 on at least you can't kill people
01:05:30 like there's some people who disagree with
01:05:32 that but they are such a minority and we feel so
01:05:34 strongly the opposite that we're going to make
01:05:36 sure those people are not listen to
01:05:38 wait wait wait what was Gibb saying
01:05:40 I was going to say about the gay wedding
01:05:42 case thing because I heard about that way
01:05:44 back when it was like relevant
01:05:46 and I remember always thinking like of course
01:05:48 you should be allowed to refuse
01:05:50 service if that's what you believe
01:05:52 even though I didn't think it was a good idea
01:05:54 I think that the
01:05:56 point is that you should have
01:05:58 the freedom
01:06:00 of expression to have a
01:06:02 like unpopular business model
01:06:04 that does badly for like
01:06:06 you would do in any other situation
01:06:08 like there was a situation that happened a couple
01:06:10 years back that was like the inverse of this
01:06:12 there are a bunch of like like super
01:06:14 hardcore Christian people like
01:06:16 passing out pamphlets and stuff
01:06:18 and like I think it was like
01:06:20 like a pro-life sort of thing that they were doing
01:06:22 and they went to this coffee shop to like take
01:06:24 a break and this guy
01:06:26 comes in and screams at them
01:06:28 that he's a gay guy and he disagrees with everything
01:06:30 he said get the fuck out of his cafe
01:06:32 we were talking about gay people don't even need a portion
01:06:34 and they did
01:06:36 and they had to leave and like
01:06:38 all the same people who would like be
01:06:40 you gotta make the cake were totally
01:06:42 on his side kicking them out so it's just like
01:06:44 that's a tough one
01:06:46 that's a double standard
01:06:48 would you force a Jewish baker to make a swastika cake
01:06:50 to which like the rebuttal to that
01:06:52 is usually oh but that would be ridiculous
01:06:54 cause those are Nazis and it's like there you go
01:06:56 what is actual free speech to you
01:06:58 is all the things that you
01:07:00 the thing is that we don't
01:07:02 need the government to do anything
01:07:04 about this because the free market
01:07:06 will do something about it
01:07:08 if you refuse
01:07:10 you just go somewhere else
01:07:12 if you make a statement that like you will not
01:07:14 make a gay cake for anybody
01:07:16 people who think that that's not okay of you
01:07:18 to do will not buy from you
01:07:20 and you could even lose your platform
01:07:22 as a store
01:07:24 you have to be renting a space
01:07:26 what if your realtors don't want to support your business anymore
01:07:28 because they don't believe in the same things as you
01:07:30 what if the people in your community
01:07:32 want you driven out what if they pick it like
01:07:34 you you know what if they stand in protest
01:07:36 outside your store every day and you can't get any customers
01:07:38 all of that's fine
01:07:40 now we get back to the thing I said at the very beginning
01:07:42 which is that people get into giant like
01:07:44 twisters on like who's the one that broke the free speech
01:07:46 you know it's like
01:07:48 who's the one who crossed the line
01:07:50 to censorship here right
01:07:52 and we need to always be very vigilant
01:07:54 of when we cross the line
01:07:56 into saying
01:07:58 the government should do something
01:08:00 about it and I think because people jump
01:08:02 to that so often we should take more
01:08:04 time out of our day to emphasize
01:08:06 that we very specifically don't want
01:08:08 the government to get in on
01:08:10 I feel like RazorFist just had a video about this
01:08:12 with the whole
01:08:14 EA gambling thing so check that out
01:08:16 I'll have to check that out I feel so bad
01:08:18 for the word censorship
01:08:20 it's really been abused these last few years
01:08:22 it's really taken a beating
01:08:24 and it's gotten a raw deal
01:08:26 censorship used to be a powerful bastion
01:08:28 and like this is a criticism of guys on like
01:08:30 the right as well
01:08:32 this isn't just like SJW
01:08:34 it's like censorship is like when
01:08:36 it's censorship
01:08:38 when someone you know like
01:08:40 I don't know I can't give you an example
01:08:42 when the government steps in and tells you
01:08:44 when people invoke
01:08:46 the government to say that
01:08:48 like if you're petitioning
01:08:50 Obama to ban
01:08:52 the word retarded
01:08:54 you are advocating censorship
01:08:56 that was a huge movement that happened
01:08:58 in the late 2000s
01:09:00 and you know
01:09:02 funnily enough
01:09:04 this goes back to what I was saying before
01:09:06 about how Louis C.K. was like the bastion
01:09:08 of free speech and then became a cuck
01:09:10 same thing with Stephen Colbert
01:09:12 he had this amazing segment where a guy
01:09:14 who was doing this campaign
01:09:16 to get rid of the word retarded
01:09:18 had come on his show
01:09:20 the entire thing and then at the very end
01:09:22 turns to the audience and says alright kids
01:09:24 don't say the word retarded
01:09:26 it's totally gay
01:09:28 this is the funniest shit I've ever heard in my life
01:09:30 that's fantastic
01:09:32 did you remember that?
01:09:34 I remember it
01:09:36 and now he would you know
01:09:38 now he'd probably be on the total opposite side of that
01:09:40 because it looks good for support
01:09:42 like it looks good to just
01:09:44 co-tow to whatever the gay community
01:09:46 wants you to say
01:09:48 AndyYoutuber who like
01:09:50 got picked up by the mainstream
01:09:52 and like became like a real
01:09:54 just streamlined everyday vloger
01:09:56 here I go
01:09:58 this is a disgrace
01:10:00 what he's doing right now
01:10:02 god it's sickening
01:10:04 I used to love Colbert
01:10:06 I loved him
01:10:08 Jesus Christ
01:10:10 all the money they threw at Colbert to take that job
01:10:12 censorship
01:10:14 that's goddamn censorship
01:10:16 old hard cash
01:10:18 it was immoral
01:10:20 all the fucking Obama stimulus bucks
01:10:22 don't trust anybody
01:10:24 if someone sold out enough
01:10:26 that they can run a late
01:10:28 night talk show they're not worth trusting anymore
01:10:30 to a degree
01:10:32 so the thing that retarded right
01:10:34 I remember one time making a chain of tweets
01:10:36 that was like two guys talking
01:10:38 and it was like oh man
01:10:40 dude my boss
01:10:42 he's totally blind to the truth
01:10:44 yeah man your boss sucks
01:10:46 oh dude
01:10:48 I'm in a cancerous relationship
01:10:50 oh man yeah man
01:10:52 I hope you get out of that relationship
01:10:54 oh dude my finances are just
01:10:56 crippled right now
01:10:58 oh man I hope you get a good break
01:11:00 oh dude this guy I saw yesterday
01:11:02 this joke I heard yesterday
01:11:04 was retarded
01:11:06 whoa hey man
01:11:08 it's offensive to use real life disabilities
01:11:10 as a negative insult
01:11:12 but someone responded with
01:11:14 I don't know with the very cogent
01:11:16 argument but I still
01:11:18 that was like my favorite tweet you ever made
01:11:20 with the very
01:11:22 not really logical but emotionally
01:11:24 I understand it argument which was as follows
01:11:26 I don't know man saying retarded
01:11:28 as an insult just seems kind of wrong
01:11:30 which is simply because
01:11:32 if you're retarded you're a worse person
01:11:34 dude I fucking hate people
01:11:36 who say shit like that because
01:11:38 they just like
01:11:40 literally that's complacency
01:11:42 it's just oh well I don't want to think about it
01:11:44 I'm just going to do what people tell me is like
01:11:46 the right thing to do
01:11:48 this is the hard truth that no one wants to face
01:11:50 if you're retarded you're a worse person
01:11:52 because in our society we value
01:11:54 who you are on the inside
01:11:56 and if you're retarded you are actually
01:11:58 worse at being a human being on the inside
01:12:00 and no one wants to face up to that
01:12:02 no you're not wrong in an intellectual
01:12:04 capacity way if you have a mental deficiency
01:12:06 then you are less
01:12:08 now to say you're a worse person than average
01:12:10 this isn't if you have great moral character
01:12:12 I'm not trying to disagree at all but
01:12:14 just for example my mom is a special education
01:12:16 teacher and I would say
01:12:18 retarded to her all the time
01:12:20 and it was very common for her to say to me
01:12:22 Nate like I wish you wouldn't say that
01:12:24 like that's people you know
01:12:26 that's a very negative thing to say
01:12:28 and like my kids would you know be the kind of people
01:12:30 I wish you wouldn't say that bitch
01:12:32 how do you like them apples
01:12:34 it's perfectly
01:12:36 I never like did that
01:12:38 occasionally I would try to avoid that particular word
01:12:40 for emphasis when talking to her
01:12:42 cause I didn't want to hurt her feelings
01:12:44 which I guess is self censorship but like
01:12:46 well it's just police
01:12:48 I think we all are gonna
01:12:50 self censorship is a good idea
01:12:52 in all capacities
01:12:54 not just of swear words
01:12:56 or things that are obviously offensive
01:12:58 censor yourself all the time for all kinds of reasons
01:13:00 cause your inner
01:13:02 your inner monologue is probably
01:13:04 most people around you
01:13:06 censorship you know even just in its usage
01:13:08 right now unfortunately has this
01:13:10 the same sort of phenomenon that the word racist
01:13:12 has had in that like so many different
01:13:14 like degrees all get mixed up in one
01:13:16 word and then people basically hear
01:13:18 the most extreme thing when you say it
01:13:20 um so like like if I
01:13:22 delete someone's tweet like I
01:13:24 understand that is like you are technically
01:13:26 accurate to say I am sort of
01:13:28 censoring them yes by the way which I like
01:13:30 literally never ever do
01:13:32 like that would be a fair thing to say but
01:13:34 beyond that I think you are going against
01:13:36 sort of the spirit of what real
01:13:38 censorship and like notable censorship
01:13:40 is if the if governments never
01:13:42 existed but Twitter did no one
01:13:44 would have thought of the word censorship as meaning anything
01:13:46 all that bad I sort of yeah I basically agree
01:13:48 and just incident I just really want to point out I never
01:13:50 delete tweets or like
01:13:52 posts or anything I like
01:13:54 I just leave it there I just want to
01:13:56 delete tweets I want to jump back on that
01:13:58 right to do so that retarded thing that
01:14:00 DeVu was saying about the guy saying like oh it's
01:14:02 just kind of like uncomfortable to say that
01:14:04 I think that is so fucking intellectually
01:14:06 dishonest and it's because
01:14:08 the words
01:14:10 that you feel uncomfortable with are changing all the time
01:14:12 it was totally different ten years
01:14:14 ago we all said retarded nobody thought it was
01:14:16 weird but now that people now that
01:14:18 someone in your social group is not okay
01:14:20 with you saying it it makes you uncomfortable
01:14:22 we used to say gay and now gay is not cool
01:14:24 but I still say it anyway
01:14:26 I think gay kind of circled
01:14:28 around being cool
01:14:30 this is how fucking simple I know people are
01:14:32 is that people will fucking
01:14:34 watch someone like that guy on the
01:14:36 Colbert report who will just turn up
01:14:38 on TV and give you a sob story
01:14:40 about why it offends him when you say
01:14:42 retarded and then you'll go around to your friends
01:14:44 and be like guys it's not okay to say retarded
01:14:46 and then you'll listen to
01:14:48 some other guy some
01:14:50 comedian who will give you the exact opposite
01:14:52 story with a decent amount of reasoning
01:14:54 and you'll go oh I guess it's okay to say retarded
01:14:56 again because this guy made the argument
01:14:58 and now I realize oh I do like saying it
01:15:00 and like people are exactly
01:15:02 that fickle that's what the Overton window does
01:15:04 is it just bounces back and forth
01:15:06 between comedian this comedian
01:15:08 made it okay to say gay again
01:15:10 this gay guy I think like you know now
01:15:12 we got Milo out there Milo
01:15:14 Milo's flaming gay he's
01:15:16 gonna say all these words you got YMS out there
01:15:18 calling people faggot all the time like
01:15:20 and he's like hey I do you think
01:15:22 I'm not allowed able to handle the word faggot
01:15:24 and fuck you and I'm like well okay
01:15:26 but did you the gay community has disowned
01:15:28 Milo they have disowned him
01:15:30 they haven't disowned YMS though
01:15:32 and he's you know you're right
01:15:34 what's more offensive to YMS calling him a faggot
01:15:36 or calling or questioning the fact that he needs
01:15:38 someone else to edit his incredibly
01:15:40 lazily edited quickies
01:15:42 YMS please fire your quickie editor
01:15:44 get somebody who can make them
01:15:46 well just like the guy is editing them
01:15:48 as though he's trying
01:15:50 to make the worst youtube video
01:15:52 I mean they could be a lot better
01:15:54 they're not great
01:15:56 I think that on this particular
01:15:58 slippery slope of like these words gay and retarded
01:16:00 I think retarded is a little bit easier
01:16:02 to justify because if you can google it
01:16:04 the second definition is
01:16:06 delay or hold back in terms
01:16:08 of progress development
01:16:10 but everyone knows what you mean when you say retarded
01:16:12 no one's using that definition
01:16:14 well hold on though because I actually
01:16:16 I don't know maybe I'm a little
01:16:18 bit more literally minded than average
01:16:20 possibly I kind of think of the word retarded
01:16:22 as like I tend to think
01:16:24 of like stupidity you know people whose brains
01:16:26 aren't sure sure but if you like if you
01:16:28 there's like a fan and you stop the fan with
01:16:30 your fingers and then you start moving the fan in the opposite direction
01:16:32 you are retarding
01:16:34 the blades of the fan
01:16:36 right like retarded does kind
01:16:38 of also mean you're absolutely
01:16:40 right that normal that word does in fact
01:16:42 have a basically socially acceptable
01:16:44 definition but here's the thing though
01:16:46 it's just if I call you
01:16:48 if I call you a faggot
01:16:50 like there's really no way around the fact
01:16:52 that that's simply an offensive word
01:16:54 now going to gay the thing about gay
01:16:56 is that the thing that we're really referring
01:16:58 to is something that like I think those
01:17:00 those words kind of the gay is getting
01:17:02 its new meaning because of a thing
01:17:04 that
01:17:06 is more commonly colloquially attributed
01:17:08 to gay individuals
01:17:10 isn't that discrimination to do that then
01:17:12 that is I think it like it has
01:17:14 a little bit more of like a discriminatory
01:17:16 or a little bit more like stereotypical
01:17:18 origin and even though
01:17:20 you recognize it's not all gay people
01:17:22 but it's like certain traits that you can
01:17:24 often see stereotypically
01:17:26 at least in gay men
01:17:28 most commonly
01:17:30 but then a lot of people
01:17:32 use the word gay me included
01:17:34 as just like bad
01:17:36 even though I don't feel that way about anything
01:17:38 homosexual I think what a lot of people forget
01:17:40 when it comes to like stereotypes and stuff
01:17:42 is that we as human beings
01:17:44 like to be a part of something
01:17:46 we like to be stereotyped
01:17:48 if it's something that we actually
01:17:50 feel connected to
01:17:52 there's a reason that black comedians
01:17:54 constantly talk about being black
01:17:56 because
01:17:58 they've taken which elements of
01:18:00 the stereotypical black experience
01:18:02 people want to identify themselves
01:18:04 with and like claimed it
01:18:06 they've been like yeah this is what black
01:18:08 people are because we like that
01:18:10 and we want to be this way
01:18:12 at least for a bit
01:18:14 yeah well my dick is big
01:18:16 what's the line that
01:18:18 Kendrick sings in black or the berry
01:18:20 that whole song is him rattling off all the black cliches
01:18:22 that black culture
01:18:24 has tried to embrace and be like
01:18:26 this is the positive image we want of ourselves
01:18:28 we'll invite some of the dumb shit too
01:18:30 watermelon and chicken whatever
01:18:32 everybody likes those things
01:18:34 that's not offensive to say that we like those things
01:18:36 I don't really care all that much for watermelon
01:18:38 although I will say just like the other day
01:18:40 that girl chasing a chicken around
01:18:42 that was kind of offensive
01:18:44 is there such a thing as inner blackface
01:18:46 because I think you've got it didgy
01:18:48 I definitely have inner I've got some kind of weird
01:18:50 concoction
01:18:52 I only interpret the world through black and Japanese
01:18:54 media like all I consume
01:18:56 is black and Japanese media so I don't
01:18:58 even know what white people are up to
01:19:00 because I can't listen to country
01:19:02 I can't do it
01:19:04 did you ever heard
01:19:06 but me hippo and Ben
01:19:08 I don't know if I heard correctly it's about how y'all
01:19:10 is a black word
01:19:12 y'all is just a southern word
01:19:14 everyone in the south says y'all
01:19:16 but also the people are black now
01:19:18 well okay
01:19:20 sure
01:19:22 you know Thomas soul doesn't just
01:19:24 do business in economics he also does black history
01:19:26 shit right he has a book called
01:19:28 it's a stupid title but it was
01:19:30 actually fucking reviewed by it better than food book reviews
01:19:32 black rednecks and white liberals
01:19:34 in which like his findings
01:19:36 that the southern culture and southern accent
01:19:38 all got sparked
01:19:40 by northern Britain
01:19:42 like those are the ones who moved to the south
01:19:44 in America and that's where the
01:19:46 accent evolved into the southern accent
01:19:48 and then that southern accent
01:19:50 and southern sensibilities were taken
01:19:52 where then you know that's where most of the black slaves
01:19:54 were and then they immigrated northwards
01:19:56 and then that's where sort of the modern
01:19:58 racism situation so what you're telling
01:20:00 me is that Gibb is
01:20:02 a slave holder that's what I'm hearing
01:20:04 southern UK
01:20:06 oh shit well
01:20:08 and in most countries north is where
01:20:10 the fucking boondock stuff
01:20:12 the funny thing about the east coast is that it's
01:20:14 like especially with black people it's all
01:20:16 very interconnected and there's lots of
01:20:18 emigration around
01:20:20 most of the people I knew in Virginia
01:20:22 in Virginia period
01:20:24 were from New York and like
01:20:26 so people constantly like transport
01:20:28 like between the south
01:20:30 like Georgia and Virginia where the cost
01:20:32 of living is a lot lower than New York
01:20:34 cause New York is like crazy overpopulated
01:20:36 and like the cost of living
01:20:38 is insanely high to have like a tiny shit hole
01:20:40 apartment so like people who can only afford
01:20:42 to live in like a one room apartment in New York
01:20:44 will just like get all their shit together
01:20:46 into a fucking car
01:20:48 and just like abandon as much as they
01:20:50 can and just hail Mary
01:20:52 down south when they have kids
01:20:54 so that they can raise their kids in a house
01:20:56 so like that's where literally like
01:20:58 half of all the black people in the south
01:21:00 like come from it's just like New Yorkers
01:21:02 who flee down to have kids
01:21:04 and then eventually a lot of those kids go back
01:21:06 up to New York cause they need jobs
01:21:08 you know? Is this like the fucking penguins
01:21:10 or certain like breeds of fish that like
01:21:12 go back and forth for mating seasons?
01:21:14 Is that what we are? Is that one of the things
01:21:16 of it's black people is penguins? I mean it's not just
01:21:18 black people but that's just like the majority
01:21:20 of who's in like the burrows in New York
01:21:22 you know like white people are doing the same shit
01:21:24 but it's just poor the poor are
01:21:26 doing this. I can't believe it we're fucking
01:21:28 penguins this is like the biggest revelation
01:21:30 Happy Feet is our future
01:21:32 Hey listen there's one more area I
01:21:34 wanted to talk about. Munchy did you wanna
01:21:36 chime in? Yeah I have a thing to
01:21:38 say about self-censorship that's alright
01:21:40 Yeah me too actually. No I censor
01:21:42 you yourself
01:21:44 I walk outside and every
01:21:46 single day when I'm interacting with
01:21:48 literally any of my family
01:21:50 all it is is like
01:21:52 self-censorship. That's all it is
01:21:54 I do not
01:21:56 There's this line in a Sam Hyde
01:21:58 like one-off
01:22:00 like vlog that is just meant
01:22:02 to be funny. It has hit home for me
01:22:04 and made me cry on certain occasions
01:22:06 Where is it? We are gonna create
01:22:08 a community for people just like us
01:22:10 brothers it's gonna be called Georgioland
01:22:12 and I am a white nationalist. Is that
01:22:14 the line you're talking about? Yeah that is it
01:22:16 It's sister line
01:22:18 is my mom would hate me if she knew what I was
01:22:20 really like. Yeah interesting
01:22:22 interesting. You know
01:22:24 I just wanna say
01:22:26 about all
01:22:28 self-censorship
01:22:30 there it is it's happening right now
01:22:32 I'm trying
01:22:34 to get the words out but I won't let me
01:22:38 I
01:22:40 like the idea
01:22:42 that you can say stuff
01:22:44 like the n-word instead of nigg
01:22:46 because
01:22:48 just because you are okay with it
01:22:50 and just because
01:22:52 people around you probably will be okay with it
01:22:54 doesn't mean you have to
01:22:56 go as hard as possible every time
01:22:58 I think it's okay to be
01:23:00 like I don't want to be called out as a bitch
01:23:02 if I say the n-word
01:23:04 I think that's just as okay to say niggas
01:23:06 I think it's fine if people
01:23:08 are uncomfortable with saying the word
01:23:10 because they legitimately don't
01:23:12 use it
01:23:14 like someone like Anthony Fantano
01:23:16 he never says it
01:23:18 even if it's in like an album title
01:23:20 like but it's because
01:23:22 he just he's never been someone
01:23:24 who says niggas so like
01:23:26 he knows it would be forced if he started now
01:23:28 like he's been avoiding it his whole life
01:23:30 why would he suddenly start
01:23:32 you know that's a reasonable
01:23:34 point the reason why I disagree
01:23:36 and I deliberately dislike when people
01:23:38 avoid saying the word is because
01:23:40 that really that is the vicious cycle
01:23:42 of keeping the word like
01:23:44 in this weird state no one can say it
01:23:46 I do call out I actually
01:23:48 just like I've said in the past
01:23:50 like I think he's a bitch for not saying it when it's in
01:23:52 an album title because I'm like to me
01:23:54 that's being ridiculous it's like
01:23:56 you're you're like you're you're so
01:23:58 obsessed with following the rules that
01:24:00 the supposed rules that you can't just like
01:24:02 literally call the thing by its goddamn
01:24:04 name that they gave it
01:24:06 you know like it's not disrespectful
01:24:08 to call it by the name that they gave
01:24:10 it there was there was a time I was
01:24:12 at karaoke in Seattle one day and
01:24:14 I I was I was doing some
01:24:16 singing and I was singing
01:24:18 some some fucking Kanye
01:24:20 song I can't remember what I was it was like the
01:24:22 closer for the night I go up there I'm busting
01:24:24 it out like the DJ guys this big old
01:24:26 black friendly fellow I'm saying it out
01:24:28 we get to this part where I bust out
01:24:30 some of the stuff the nigga we
01:24:32 we lock eyes he gives me a smile and a
01:24:34 firm nod and I keep going
01:24:36 I had that exact experience
01:24:38 during karaoke when I was
01:24:40 doing yeah because
01:24:42 I was I was at a karaoke bar with my
01:24:44 one of my black friends was there and him
01:24:46 and the other black guy who just happened to be
01:24:48 at the bar like teamed up to do a Kendrick
01:24:50 Lamar song because you know
01:24:52 hi everyone every if you
01:24:54 know anything black then you must
01:24:56 be a fan of Kendrick Lamar it's just like the
01:24:58 rules right now basically in culture
01:25:00 so yeah these guys won't get on
01:25:02 stage to do bitch don't kill my vibe
01:25:04 but I immediately detect that neither
01:25:06 of these guys actually knows the words
01:25:08 but I do so I get up there
01:25:10 and I'm like gonna do the actual rap
01:25:12 parts you know for these guys
01:25:14 and I'm sitting there and like I'm saying
01:25:16 nigga and I see the dude I can tell the
01:25:18 dude who doesn't know me for like one seconds
01:25:20 like hold up did that white dude just say
01:25:22 nigga but then he's like then again he knows
01:25:24 all the words and neither of us do
01:25:26 so who's the realest nigga up here for real though
01:25:28 right and you know what
01:25:30 okay look I'm just gonna like make an assumption here
01:25:32 maybe other people like can confirm
01:25:34 this if I'm a black guy
01:25:36 and I hear some white person say nigger
01:25:38 I might perk up because maybe they're racist
01:25:40 or maybe they're chill right and you have to
01:25:42 like worry about that right you know
01:25:44 like it's just unfortunate that we're
01:25:46 in a situation where the words are this
01:25:48 you know
01:25:50 intense oh yeah oh what if
01:25:52 what if we send the naked one
01:25:54 that's good that would be awesome
01:25:56 oh by the way the song was runaway I was
01:25:58 singing that's what it was
01:26:00 one time one time did you remember
01:26:02 Matthew Matosis review of fireshock
01:26:04 infinite where like it's supposed to be
01:26:06 this society where people are racist against blacks
01:26:08 but they never go farther than saying
01:26:10 niggro yeah he literally
01:26:12 was like shit maybe saying nigger all
01:26:14 the time like because that
01:26:16 because if you if you don't let them use
01:26:18 the word nigger then you're like
01:26:20 you're making your whitewashing it you're making
01:26:22 it look better shit than it was
01:26:24 and like yeah and honestly
01:26:26 if you're a person who gets upset when white
01:26:28 people say nigger but not black people as
01:26:30 much all I can imagine
01:26:32 is like an old-timey 1950s photograph
01:26:34 with a couple of fucking water faucets
01:26:36 there's a nice one that says
01:26:38 the words for white people
01:26:40 only you can only use prim and proper words
01:26:42 if you're a white person then down here at the
01:26:44 little dingy water fountain
01:26:46 that's the ones that the colored people can say
01:26:48 they can say words like nigger if they wish right
01:26:50 that's what I see it's fucking
01:26:52 I hear you all right hey by the way
01:26:54 you guys ready for a big call out
01:26:56 you want me to you want me to call somebody
01:26:58 out on the show oh jeez
01:27:00 yes I'm ready I'm ready
01:27:02 so this is also this debate
01:27:04 is a thing in the black community
01:27:06 because of the fact that
01:27:08 Quentin Tarantino
01:27:10 wrote Django Unchained
01:27:12 Spike Lee is not okay with this
01:27:14 Spike Lee who's like the blackest
01:27:16 director ever you know
01:27:18 he made he's made all kinds of
01:27:20 fucking great movies he made
01:27:22 what's the fucking one that Jesse
01:27:24 loves Nate you know it right
01:27:26 glorious bastards
01:27:28 do the right thing
01:27:30 do the right thing
01:27:32 and like he directed kings of comedy all this other shit
01:27:34 he has a real
01:27:36 problem with Quentin Tarantino
01:27:38 saying you know like writing nigger into his
01:27:40 scripts and he called out
01:27:42 Samuel L. Jackson for being
01:27:44 in the movie he was like
01:27:46 he's like yo I'm not okay with that
01:27:48 Samuel L. Jackson was like look
01:27:50 like this is real shit and he said
01:27:52 he said Samuel L. Jackson said you think
01:27:54 I'm gonna pass up the opportunity to play
01:27:56 the most hated black character in
01:27:58 cinema history like no I'm taking
01:28:00 it you know but like
01:28:02 it's just what are you trying to do
01:28:04 Spike Lee are you trying to make it seem
01:28:06 like the racist slave holding
01:28:08 American south wasn't
01:28:10 offensive enough to say nigger
01:28:12 I mean you know what Spike Lee is trying to do
01:28:14 at the end of the day here's what I think it comes down to
01:28:16 like I understand
01:28:18 why there are some people who are
01:28:20 uncomfortable with the message of
01:28:22 Tarantino's film and why like
01:28:24 they would think it's not okay for him to
01:28:26 write this movie but
01:28:28 like I don't
01:28:30 like I don't see how those people cannot
01:28:32 understand that there are other black people
01:28:34 who will be like no this is actually exactly
01:28:36 what I wanted this is totally vindicating
01:28:38 and I love it which is how a lot of my
01:28:40 black friends were about the movie like
01:28:42 literally my friend Marcus
01:28:44 was a black guy who didn't really say
01:28:46 nigger much until he watched
01:28:48 Django and then started saying nigger
01:28:50 all the time like and he literally
01:28:52 attributed it to the movie like
01:28:54 that was amazing that's the kind of
01:28:56 shit that is actually happening in the
01:28:58 world this is real that
01:29:00 was a real story I just told you and
01:29:02 like you have to think about that when
01:29:04 you talk about this shit you got to think
01:29:06 about the black guy who watched that movie
01:29:08 and felt so like
01:29:10 I mean I don't know what that means about him
01:29:12 and maybe some people be like oh I'm not okay with
01:29:14 that being like how the youth are feeling but
01:29:16 like look that's just what it is like this dude came from
01:29:18 Virginia Beach he was raised
01:29:20 weird because he had to go to speech therapy when he was
01:29:22 young so he talks white and like
01:29:24 people picked up on that and didn't really
01:29:26 include him and so he hung out with
01:29:28 me and anime nerds and learned how to do
01:29:30 kung fu and became jacked and joined
01:29:32 the army like this is the kind of people who
01:29:34 exist we got to think about everyone
01:29:36 who exists when we talk about who can say what
01:29:38 words and what they mean to who you know
01:29:40 right you know when I like I feel that in
01:29:42 myself I forgot my call out though
01:29:44 my call out is Nino
01:29:46 my call out is Nino who jumped on my
01:29:48 song white nigger to help make this
01:29:50 point but then he came back
01:29:52 later and he got famous on black
01:29:54 twitter and started
01:29:56 writing for a fucking huffington post
01:29:58 and I was doing this
01:30:00 yeah Nino writes for HuffPo
01:30:02 on like their black site like they're
01:30:04 they're like black interest
01:30:06 page yeah okay
01:30:08 point being that because
01:30:10 he started like hanging out with them
01:30:12 he's all like oh now I now I'm not
01:30:14 like about white people saying nigga no
01:30:16 more like and I was
01:30:18 like oh you fucking cunt
01:30:20 you nigger get out of here
01:30:22 there you go whatever you know when you
01:30:24 talk about like what's up with the double
01:30:26 standard and people like people were very
01:30:28 explicit about it like movie bob will say
01:30:30 dude slavery is why
01:30:32 the countries that we are living in right now
01:30:34 did these things that underprivileged
01:30:36 certain colors and overprivileged others
01:30:38 that's the reason there's a double standard
01:30:40 because when you go into it on an individual
01:30:42 basis it seems like the double standard comes from someone who
01:30:44 went to fucking college or got a job in media
01:30:46 like or got a fucking liberal
01:30:48 friends you know honestly
01:30:50 I don't have much to say on this point
01:30:52 except that I just want
01:30:54 to say that like like did you
01:30:56 like well I don't know I don't
01:30:58 have burn with a seething rage
01:31:00 at how how like lucky
01:31:02 black people are they get to say the
01:31:04 word nigga I don't burn
01:31:06 with that but I don't feel that way
01:31:08 either I just want to clarify
01:31:10 that the reason that I feel so strongly about
01:31:12 this is simply that this word
01:31:14 has always been in my head
01:31:16 and to me it's like
01:31:18 it's so ludicrous to be like
01:31:20 oh like
01:31:22 everything you like has always had
01:31:24 this in it like you've you've
01:31:26 the movies you grew up on the music you listen to
01:31:28 just like everyone else it's the same reason
01:31:30 black people use the word is they
01:31:32 hear it all the time so that's I
01:31:34 heard it all the time and but it's like
01:31:36 it's literally discrimination
01:31:38 to look at someone and be like oh well you might
01:31:40 have grown up with this word just like anybody else
01:31:42 but because your skin color is different you can't say it
01:31:44 I completely agree and that was my point
01:31:46 my one of my favorite shows of all
01:31:48 time is the boondocks and I know
01:31:50 100% without a doubt
01:31:52 it is due to my love for the boondocks
01:31:54 and the excessive use of the word
01:31:56 nigga but I started to incorporate it into
01:31:58 my day literally when I was 12 I
01:32:00 read all of the comics
01:32:02 this is what I would call
01:32:04 the good kind of cultural appropriation
01:32:06 like I developed an appreciation for
01:32:08 hip-hop as a result of watching the
01:32:10 boondocks and like I got introduced to
01:32:12 just like more black characters expanded
01:32:14 my interest so I would say
01:32:16 that like because of the fact all cultural
01:32:18 appropriation is good except for like really
01:32:20 tacky cultural appropriation I think
01:32:22 that because of the fact that like black
01:32:24 culture has so much like meta text
01:32:26 to it and that like that the boondocks
01:32:28 is specifically about exploring that
01:32:30 like when you watch that as someone
01:32:32 like me who's got like a very
01:32:34 categorical brain where like I
01:32:36 memorize all the names and connections between
01:32:38 things like I do with the anime industry but like
01:32:40 with black culture because it's
01:32:42 so self-referential and everybody's like playing
01:32:44 off of each other all the time like
01:32:46 when you start studying that
01:32:48 it's involving in the same way that like anime
01:32:50 is and that's why
01:32:52 I end up like like all my
01:32:54 favorite shows that aren't anime are like
01:32:56 the boondocks in Atlanta and like other shit
01:32:58 like that because like it's almost a narrative
01:33:00 I'm keeping up with of like what's going on
01:33:02 with the blacks you know like well okay
01:33:04 I just want to make the point that like
01:33:06 it just simply is part
01:33:08 of my human experience to like
01:33:10 use the word nigga for example
01:33:12 and I just want people to know that if you
01:33:14 tell me that I can't do that that's
01:33:16 I understand your perspective but
01:33:18 it's not that I'm just burning
01:33:20 it's just you're simply telling me to not be
01:33:22 who I am so if you're comfortable doing that
01:33:24 that's fine like you can make that
01:33:26 argument but that's why I
01:33:28 strongly disagree with that point
01:33:32 the only other thing I want to talk about was I wanted
01:33:34 just to cover for the sake of clarity
01:33:36 you always got to touch on the private
01:33:38 versus public like censorship
01:33:40 legality like
01:33:42 what did you get banned on Twitter is this
01:33:44 censorship is this you know
01:33:46 fucking is that a violin free speech
01:33:48 like what's the deal here
01:33:50 I think that like obviously
01:33:52 Twitter's
01:33:54 they're a company who can do it
01:33:56 whatever they want but like
01:33:58 I do wish that there was like a protected
01:34:00 version of Twitter because I think
01:34:02 Twitter weirdly is
01:34:04 like a resource the world needs
01:34:06 like I think it's proven that
01:34:08 like the amount of like
01:34:10 like I mean the entire fucking Arab spring
01:34:12 happened because of Twitter like what the fuck
01:34:14 like it's it's so important
01:34:16 to like disaster
01:34:18 relief efforts and stuff like there should
01:34:20 be like an open public
01:34:22 highway version of Twitter that
01:34:24 like yeah and
01:34:26 it should be and it should be for everybody like
01:34:28 you shouldn't be able to get banned from it you know
01:34:30 well that's the thing about corporations in general
01:34:32 is that this is something that libertarians
01:34:34 because there should be no money let's sorry
01:34:36 just there should be no
01:34:38 corporate interest tied into it so that people
01:34:40 can have unpopular opinions and it's not
01:34:42 going to affect anyone's business
01:34:44 interest is why I want it to be like yeah
01:34:46 you know but like okay so like that's the thing
01:34:48 about like corporations in general and this is something
01:34:50 that libertarians are they really need
01:34:52 to like get themselves fucking
01:34:54 woke on this they really need to address this that
01:34:56 the whole reason we came up with free
01:34:58 government the whole reason we came up with the idea
01:35:00 of rights is because we
01:35:02 entered an age where we were approaching
01:35:04 industry where governments were able
01:35:06 to have a level of organized power
01:35:08 that they could really micromanage and fuck
01:35:10 with people's lives no one would have come up
01:35:12 with the constitution in like 5000 BC
01:35:14 right so for the same
01:35:16 reason we are now entering a society
01:35:18 where things are so interconnected that
01:35:20 corporations are able to do a very similar
01:35:22 thing like even though it's all
01:35:24 technically voluntary the level
01:35:26 of control they can have
01:35:28 over society is getting
01:35:30 pretty fucking
01:35:32 thick and it's getting harder and harder
01:35:34 for me to justify it as simply
01:35:36 their private company if you know what I mean
01:35:38 yeah that's like the argument
01:35:40 where people are arguing like our twitter and facebook
01:35:42 are they at the point where they're becoming like public
01:35:44 utilities that's the issue
01:35:46 that's the issue
01:35:48 like what if someone still made the argument that
01:35:50 well you know the internet's run by private
01:35:52 companies so like it took
01:35:54 there was a point where we decided
01:35:56 that like telephones were a public utility
01:35:58 because like an inventor
01:36:00 made it and then it became popular
01:36:02 and then they made a utility and then I think
01:36:04 the same happened with the internet and
01:36:06 like it's just I really
01:36:08 think a lot about this like what's the right
01:36:10 balance we I have no interest
01:36:12 in like dictating exactly to a company
01:36:14 what to do to pursue
01:36:16 their profit motive that's that's their business
01:36:18 and that's totally fine but on
01:36:20 the other side when you're in the business
01:36:22 of like allowing people
01:36:24 to communicate it becomes
01:36:26 like if twitter
01:36:28 is actually causing society
01:36:30 to splinter down
01:36:32 the middle into like a more divided
01:36:34 society that is
01:36:36 not good and the question is
01:36:38 how to address that like social media
01:36:40 really seems to just have done
01:36:42 this straight up so
01:36:44 what's the fix I don't you mean like
01:36:46 politically I mean politically yes and
01:36:48 along like ideological lines
01:36:50 say like oh man fucking
01:36:52 social media is going to make it to where you only get
01:36:54 articles and headlines that you agree with
01:36:56 and I I get fucking ha ha
01:36:58 here's what Trump did this week like all over
01:37:00 the damn place to this day so I don't know
01:37:02 like if this isn't working on me but personally
01:37:04 in my experience I've
01:37:06 seen it as it's making people
01:37:08 more aware of what
01:37:10 other sides are saying than ever before
01:37:12 maybe that's the problem I don't know
01:37:14 I have the exact same experience
01:37:16 as you where I constantly have
01:37:18 friends we're both super libsuck
01:37:20 you know full of conservative gods
01:37:22 ha ha ha ha ha
01:37:24 all the issues Trump is bad or Trump is
01:37:26 good I think the problem
01:37:28 is is that most people do
01:37:30 not have
01:37:32 people who are they don't have
01:37:34 a varied taste in friends yeah they
01:37:36 get into the bubble of people who agree with them
01:37:38 yeah maybe they get into their bubble because it's
01:37:40 really stressful but I think ultimately
01:37:42 I think the internet still
01:37:44 like even in your bubble you're going to see things
01:37:46 eat through the algorithms are not perfect
01:37:48 and I just think that like people are more aware
01:37:50 than ever if you go to an extreme opposite
01:37:52 end 500 years ago
01:37:54 people with opposite political opinions
01:37:56 lived in a different country past a border
01:37:58 and maybe a sea or two and didn't even
01:38:00 know them you the only chance you would have
01:38:02 to conflict with them is up the
01:38:04 broad side of a sword in a battle right
01:38:06 but now we actually are much more aware
01:38:08 of other world view you know that
01:38:10 like yeah that we wouldn't have known about
01:38:12 and it stresses us out but
01:38:14 it moves society you know like like
01:38:16 forces us all to hear one another
01:38:18 I feel like
01:38:20 right now I love being alive now
01:38:22 because I get to listen to like
01:38:24 I'll listen to fucking like
01:38:26 Ben Shapiro then like the young Turks
01:38:28 and then I'll like listen to something Stefan Mullen
01:38:30 you says then I'll go listen to like fucking
01:38:32 Sam Harris, Kyle Kalinsky
01:38:34 fucking I'll listen to like the same
01:38:36 video about the same topic
01:38:38 from like five, six sources
01:38:40 I can't do that shit
01:38:42 I would drive me nuts
01:38:44 put it on in the background like while I'm working
01:38:46 so I just it fills the time and by doing that
01:38:48 I feel like I'm finally getting closer
01:38:50 to like I know everyone's biases
01:38:52 because I've listened to all these people a long time
01:38:54 and now I know like okay Stefan Mullen
01:38:56 you is like insanely dedicated
01:38:58 to like protecting children to like kind of a
01:39:00 crazy degree I'm not calling him crazy but like
01:39:02 so like he's got huge biases he hates
01:39:04 big government he you know logically
01:39:06 see has deducted that like government
01:39:08 is evil gotta get rid of it like okay that's his bias
01:39:10 the young Turks super left wing
01:39:12 but SJW you keep all that bias
01:39:14 brings to the table all of internet
01:39:16 yeah interaction
01:39:18 and all trying to deduce the truth
01:39:20 from politics yeah it's just
01:39:22 like an eight like a times eight
01:39:24 or more Venn diagram
01:39:26 you have to have everyone's bubble
01:39:28 all lined up and then that's right
01:39:30 everyone has in common is the truth
01:39:32 I think that I think Stefan
01:39:34 Mullen real quick like like the Stefan
01:39:36 Mullen you think yeah have you
01:39:38 heard I think he's probably probably heard him talk about
01:39:40 his audio book
01:39:42 universally preferable behavior I've never listened to it
01:39:44 but I've heard about it I recommend it to you because
01:39:46 it's basically him trying to derive
01:39:48 in a sense of objective morality
01:39:50 yeah it's through like just logic it's just
01:39:52 what I've been to yeah yeah I feel like
01:39:54 utilitarians would it would be your
01:39:56 I'd like never quite get through it because he
01:39:58 I feel like I'm finally ready to try and listen to all of it
01:40:00 because he's basically it's him trying to solve the problem
01:40:02 with no one being able to agree on morality
01:40:04 right so I don't know
01:40:06 I gotta listen to it
01:40:08 God you fucking I didn't expect
01:40:10 you to go out about that audio book it made me forget
01:40:12 what the fuck point I was gonna try to make
01:40:14 well shit about biases
01:40:16 something to do with oh that I
01:40:18 don't think the problem is that
01:40:20 we we get into like a bubble and only listen
01:40:22 to a few voices it's that those voices
01:40:24 are not good or are untrustworthy
01:40:26 okay that like there's too many voices
01:40:28 that like
01:40:30 there's a reason that I've come to where like
01:40:32 the only like politicized
01:40:34 YouTuber who I really follow is
01:40:36 RazorFist and it's not because
01:40:38 I agree with everything
01:40:40 he says it's because I trust
01:40:42 him to do
01:40:44 the most research
01:40:46 that every video he does he will
01:40:48 have looked at everything he knows
01:40:50 the names of everyone
01:40:52 in the government he knows
01:40:54 like what they're doing he knows their histories
01:40:56 he knows what's
01:40:58 happening he doesn't listen to the media
01:41:00 and what they're saying he waits until
01:41:02 there is real information that he can use
01:41:04 and he almost always
01:41:06 comes out like if he said something was
01:41:08 going to happen it usually happens
01:41:10 because he's keeping track of what's
01:41:12 going on better than anybody and like
01:41:14 the world is not that hard to understand
01:41:16 you just need to know all the information
01:41:18 the problem with like the young Turks
01:41:20 and Kyle Kulinski to a degree a lot of
01:41:22 these guys who do daily
01:41:24 multiple episodes of the show
01:41:26 they want to produce content as fast
01:41:28 as possible and I don't think any of them have bad intention
01:41:30 but it's their business model that puts
01:41:32 him in a position of doing that
01:41:34 fundamentally the reason why he has the luxury
01:41:36 to be fucking informed is that he's
01:41:38 not a political
01:41:40 YouTuber he talks about video games
01:41:42 and heavy metal and he only makes
01:41:44 a statement on politics
01:41:46 when he has a statement that he's actually pretty confident
01:41:48 in and can look cool making
01:41:50 and I mean
01:41:52 someone else who like their
01:41:54 their job every morning is to get up and like
01:41:56 put on their spin to make them
01:41:58 make their side look good it's just
01:42:00 I'll tell you right now that while I'm happy
01:42:02 this hasn't happened
01:42:04 if like super bunny hop ever
01:42:06 became a political guy
01:42:08 he would be one of the only people I'd listen to
01:42:10 because I know he'll do all the research
01:42:12 I know he'll come in with all the
01:42:14 info he'll never open his mouth about it
01:42:16 if he if he didn't you know I have a
01:42:18 yeah and like that's why I have so much
01:42:20 respect for both of those guys
01:42:22 as as like journalists
01:42:24 on YouTube because I think
01:42:26 that we're in an era now where
01:42:28 magazines are just straight up
01:42:30 irrelevant and because
01:42:32 of the fact that none of them know how to adapt
01:42:34 to YouTube because they're all fucking retarded
01:42:36 we have we as YouTubers
01:42:38 have to figure out how to make journalism
01:42:40 possible on the platform and like
01:42:42 those two guys are the only people
01:42:44 who I know of who I consider like
01:42:46 serious respectable journalists
01:42:48 who I can trust to have done
01:42:50 all the research and I know
01:42:52 they're going to tell me facts you know
01:42:54 dude dude doctor wolf watches
01:42:56 the episode before he
01:42:58 he goes deep
01:43:00 he goes deep
01:43:06 like integrity
01:43:08 doctor wolf always gets a laugh
01:43:10 I want to know what my self-censorship real quick
01:43:12 before we close out okay because when did you
01:43:14 talk about him and his his childhood
01:43:16 I really wanted to just share my piece
01:43:18 we went on a different course so I'll just let things
01:43:20 ease down now so you know
01:43:22 having like Christian non-swery parents
01:43:24 parents who I want to go put
01:43:26 it on the record will say
01:43:28 like nigger if we're talking about the word
01:43:30 like they'll say it out of context
01:43:32 they'll say racial words out of context
01:43:34 but they'll never say fuck or shit out of context
01:43:36 right I'm just like
01:43:38 nah that's a little bit bullshit
01:43:40 that's a little bit bullshit anyway you know and then also
01:43:42 like being homeschooled
01:43:44 and put into sort of like a really tight Christian
01:43:46 bubble of like various like kids
01:43:48 who also have Christian parents so there was
01:43:50 just unlike Digi not really
01:43:52 ever surrounded by
01:43:54 swear words right and not having
01:43:56 watched adult content as a child
01:43:58 so like it took me a while to even learn
01:44:00 what all the swear words were actually
01:44:02 and like you know it's like you know seven
01:44:04 or eight or so and
01:44:06 then by the time I'm around 13
01:44:08 I start getting into more like I start
01:44:10 watching like South Park or Family Guy
01:44:12 and stuff like that just completely off my own volition
01:44:14 because my parents like don't even barely even watch
01:44:16 much TV at this point
01:44:18 let's just watch Fox News actually
01:44:20 all the fucking cop drama shows
01:44:22 but so then like you know I'll be watching
01:44:24 like South Park right and then my dad
01:44:26 will be like oh would you watch it I'm watching
01:44:28 South Park you know and he's like
01:44:30 hmm and I know exactly
01:44:32 what to tell him to like
01:44:34 to shut him off right right which is
01:44:36 oh don't worry I'm not going to go around
01:44:38 swearing like they do in South Park
01:44:40 and he's like okay I guess that's fine you know
01:44:42 and then like maybe I'll be showing some episodes to Aaron
01:44:44 who my brother who at this point would be like 12
01:44:46 years old and like
01:44:48 I'd be like hmm I don't know
01:44:50 but hey Aaron's like don't worry neither
01:44:52 of us are going to swear don't worry we're not going to do it
01:44:54 you know and he's like okay as long as you promise
01:44:56 to not be like those violent cartoons
01:44:58 and then you can totally do it
01:45:00 so what happened was
01:45:02 as we get older by the time we're like
01:45:04 adults or like he's almost an adult
01:45:06 we no longer
01:45:08 like give a single shit like we
01:45:10 are perfectly fine to swear on one another
01:45:12 because we do not care anymore
01:45:14 except for the fact that we've
01:45:16 promised to not swear as a result
01:45:18 of watching swearing cartoons
01:45:20 and we're both filled with pride over it
01:45:22 we have so much ego on the line
01:45:24 to prove to our father
01:45:26 that we're not going to break the promise not of like
01:45:28 loyalty but just to prove that we're
01:45:30 this is exactly the line this is the exact
01:45:32 logic that me and Victor are on
01:45:34 and exactly like didgy
01:45:36 we came up with our own like swear genre
01:45:38 so for example we started using
01:45:40 um van
01:45:42 as a swear word right like what the van
01:45:44 is going on here yeah are you van
01:45:46 and kidding me right so
01:45:48 we came up with that as a swear
01:45:50 because we were think we were talking about
01:45:52 like old actors maybe we were even talking
01:45:54 about Mary Poppins we were we brought
01:45:56 up dick van dyke and we thought
01:45:58 you know dick if van
01:46:00 were a bad word dick van dyke's
01:46:02 entire name would be bad yeah I
01:46:04 thought you were going to go with uh Jean Claude
01:46:06 van dam to avoid saying the word
01:46:08 damn that works too but that would apply
01:46:10 as well but just you know but dick van dyke
01:46:12 so there you go so van
01:46:14 just started saying van as a swear we
01:46:16 I think we gave it like a couple years of run time
01:46:18 before it like really wore out as welcome and just
01:46:20 made us cringe and then that's just when we started
01:46:22 I'm curious to know on the subject
01:46:24 you have like made up swear words like that
01:46:26 did your parents ever object to like not
01:46:28 the word but like sort of the tone
01:46:30 that you say the word with like hey I know
01:46:32 what you're doing there buddy you're trying to get
01:46:34 something past me by saying a completely
01:46:36 literally inoffensive word but it's your tone
01:46:38 that's the swear being said oh yeah
01:46:40 yes oh what the fuck
01:46:42 and overreacting it's all about tone and shit
01:46:44 he wouldn't like it's anything he wouldn't like
01:46:46 punish me well sure sure no matter how young I was
01:46:48 but it was just sort of like it's just interesting
01:46:50 once again my mind is being torn apart
01:46:52 by the breadth of the realization
01:46:54 that this is just what the 90s was
01:46:56 like this isn't unique to our households
01:46:58 because this is the entire logic
01:47:00 that humankind
01:47:02 underwent up until
01:47:04 the 2000s and here's what I mean
01:47:06 do you any of you remember
01:47:08 I don't know if you were still watching Cartoon Network
01:47:10 at all at the time when regular show came out
01:47:12 I know Munchie
01:47:14 I don't really like to call myself a 90s kid
01:47:16 this was all 2000s
01:47:18 do you guys remember the first time on regular
01:47:20 show that they said piss
01:47:22 no I don't did anybody see
01:47:24 that was that like ground
01:47:26 to me it was because
01:47:28 okay okay on adventure
01:47:30 time first of all kids are
01:47:32 they saying suck on cartoons
01:47:34 they said suck on
01:47:36 Steven Universe the other day
01:47:38 exactly so they
01:47:40 started saying okay adventure time broke the
01:47:42 seal on saying sucks
01:47:44 and like dang it and heck
01:47:46 and stuff like that like they were able to say that
01:47:48 shit then regular show
01:47:50 yeah they could say kill and die
01:47:52 and they've used that a lot
01:47:54 they like really went in on the fact
01:47:56 there's like a whole regular show about dying
01:47:58 and then there's yeah
01:48:00 in regular show they started saying piss off
01:48:02 they started saying
01:48:04 is the idea behind the word suck
01:48:06 like suck dick is that like
01:48:08 we're suck puns because then
01:48:10 you have feminists on it
01:48:12 I guess we're gonna have to have a whole
01:48:14 fucking debate on that
01:48:16 because you couldn't say
01:48:18 you couldn't say suck
01:48:20 but you could say that something blows
01:48:22 even though they're literally saying
01:48:24 that is true
01:48:26 the fucking thing about it is
01:48:28 I literally watched them
01:48:30 physically move
01:48:32 the overton window
01:48:34 like a boulder like sycophus pushing it up
01:48:36 the hill like because you can
01:48:38 look at the 80s and see that
01:48:40 there was a period where cartoons were
01:48:42 a lot more violent and crazy because like
01:48:44 G.I. Joe was the biggest thing and transformers
01:48:46 and all that shit and
01:48:48 then you go to the 90s and they cleaned
01:48:50 it all up no one there's like
01:48:52 no guns anymore no one can say kill
01:48:54 no one can like you know
01:48:56 do this or that and then you get to the
01:48:58 I definitely remember Bart Simpson saying that
01:49:00 well Simpsons was different
01:49:02 and that was why Simpsons was so popular
01:49:04 was that it was like a counterbalance
01:49:06 because it aired on primetime TV
01:49:08 on WB it was not a kids show
01:49:10 that's the thing this is not
01:49:12 like it always gets less censorship it's an ebb
01:49:14 and flow you see an old cartoon the characters
01:49:16 can fucking drink alcohol and be drunk
01:49:18 and now speaking of the Simpsons
01:49:20 we might be entering an era where it's
01:49:22 too problematic to have a white person
01:49:24 voicing non-white character
01:49:26 the thing about like both America
01:49:28 and Japan are very particular
01:49:30 about time slots as being like
01:49:32 the definition of what can and cannot pass
01:49:34 so like primetime TV
01:49:36 like even with adventure time
01:49:38 and regular show the reason those shows could get away with that
01:49:40 is that they usually aired in the afternoon
01:49:42 and it was more of like an older
01:49:44 like the kids who were like
01:49:46 10 to 15 watched during
01:49:48 that time you know as opposed to the
01:49:50 really little kids who they're gonna like
01:49:52 just show nothing but Teen Titans go to
01:49:54 you all morning because that's like
01:49:56 Teen Titans go is
01:49:58 the only show they've ever made that is
01:50:00 not only great but also
01:50:02 like it's so mind numbingly
01:50:04 colorful that kids can just stare at it all day
01:50:06 so that's all they air through the morning
01:50:08 but like you know
01:50:10 as they moved to like younger and
01:50:12 younger shows using these words even
01:50:14 Teen Titans go is gonna say these words now
01:50:16 you know like even the stuff they're
01:50:18 showing to little kids because like just nobody
01:50:20 cares anymore like now that we have the
01:50:22 internet you cannot protect kids
01:50:24 from bad words anymore like it's just fucking
01:50:26 impossible unless you really are strict
01:50:28 parent you know but like
01:50:30 it's like we can't lie to
01:50:32 ourselves any longer and why did we
01:50:34 ever do it in the first place we all look like idiots
01:50:36 I think religious regions
01:50:38 I think a lot of this came from
01:50:40 like oh oh oh yeah yeah I have to
01:50:42 tell you guys the one last fucking fake
01:50:44 square I came up with okay well me me and my
01:50:46 brother did wasn't really what was more like
01:50:48 it was actually an all new innovation
01:50:50 in the whole medium of language itself
01:50:52 so my brother
01:50:54 he just started saying shitsu you know
01:50:56 oh shitsu oh man
01:50:58 or even my fiance she likes to say shetlinpony
01:51:00 right but yeah shitsu
01:51:02 oh shitsu you know and then
01:51:04 we were like oh shitsu and then sometimes
01:51:06 we delayed it oh shit
01:51:08 now you're pushing the edge there boy you're getting
01:51:10 ready for a beat oh oh you have no idea
01:51:12 oh yeah oh that's just the beginning
01:51:14 then we were like wait a second we were just like
01:51:16 oh shitsu oh shitsu wait a second
01:51:18 fuck
01:51:20 shitsu it still works
01:51:22 we're like we have this
01:51:24 like agreement
01:51:26 it's all arbitrary right yeah like
01:51:28 language it's all arbitrary the fact that
01:51:30 fuck is offensive in the first place is arbitrary
01:51:32 it was just made up no one's gonna be around
01:51:34 to challenge this we hereby declare
01:51:36 that you could swear as many fucking
01:51:38 goddamn mother shitting cunt
01:51:40 blocking times as you want as long as you
01:51:42 stay sue within any
01:51:44 time afterwards that's good I like it
01:51:46 so sometimes we just be like what the fuck
01:51:48 what the fuck off me shitsu head
01:51:50 sue
01:51:52 two straight years being like we're still
01:51:54 doing we still have our pride
01:51:56 that we are not swearing
01:51:58 just like we promised our dad I like that
01:52:00 that's creativity at work
01:52:02 so have we figured anything out here
01:52:04 have we answered the question of
01:52:06 is free speech cool or is it gay
01:52:08 no what we've learned is that we can
01:52:10 just say nigger sue and it's fine
01:52:12 yeah it's all arbitrary
01:52:14 it's a bunch of bullshit let hashtag
01:52:16 let children swear
01:52:18 that's where I'm at that's where I'm at with this
01:52:20 what we've learned is that we've already
01:52:22 heard all of these complaints
01:52:24 yeah yeah you're right on all of our other
01:52:26 shows and this has bred
01:52:28 no new conversation whatsoever
01:52:30 agreed indeed
01:52:32 I hope you listen to this podcast
01:52:34 while doing something productive
01:52:36 fans you know friends and family out there
01:52:38 that's what I do when I listen to podcasts
01:52:40 let me talk about my 4chan uncle
01:52:42 because I'm in an interesting situation
01:52:44 4chan uncle
01:52:46 as you all know I have an uncle
01:52:48 he goes on 4chan
01:52:50 a deadly combination
01:52:52 and he's always downstairs
01:52:54 in my house now because he's a dead bean
01:52:56 for various other reasons
01:52:58 and so I'm walking downstairs
01:53:00 and he always tries to rote me in conversations
01:53:02 about Hitler and the Jews
01:53:04 no matter how he's doing harassment
01:53:06 you wouldn't censor his free speech
01:53:08 by not listening to him now would you munchie
01:53:10 no I would never censor his free speech
01:53:12 I just have my own free speech
01:53:14 the entire reason that he is talking to me
01:53:16 in the first place
01:53:18 he's always been in a stupor
01:53:20 and he doesn't really talk to anyone
01:53:22 but I have
01:53:24 outed myself as someone who
01:53:26 knows what 4chan is
01:53:28 oh no
01:53:30 he always wants to talk to me
01:53:32 you can't underling this bell
01:53:34 exactly I can't explain to him
01:53:36 but I don't believe these same things
01:53:38 or you know do any of this stuff
01:53:40 I just know what 4chan is
01:53:42 but I'm not going to do that
01:53:44 I'm just going to censor myself
01:53:46 and just go along with whatever political opinion is
01:53:48 so mostly because I'm just a coward
01:53:50 that's the only reason that this is happening
01:53:52 sounds like a hassle
01:53:54 you want to save space at home
01:53:56 we all want to save space at home
01:53:58 I don't even challenge scary 4chan ideas
01:54:00 I'm in this bizarre
01:54:02 dichotomy
01:54:04 whenever I'm around my mom's
01:54:06 it's like yeah I fucking hate Trump
01:54:08 and then whenever I'm with my uncle
01:54:10 I'm like yeah I fucking want to suck Trump's dick
01:54:12 looking pretty dangly right there
01:54:14 but also
01:54:16 hey can you take me out to lunch real quick
01:54:20 I'm playing like a fiddle
01:54:22 I was going to say having
01:54:24 pretty
01:54:26 hardline but firmline
01:54:28 strict conservative Christian
01:54:30 type people as parents
01:54:32 and then also being an art person
01:54:34 on the internet
01:54:36 pretty good at spinning whatever I want to say
01:54:38 to be palatable to both people
01:54:40 like oh oh oh oh
01:54:42 me and my fiance were
01:54:44 at dinner with both my parents
01:54:46 and we were actually talking about
01:54:48 Stefan Molinou's peaceful parenting
01:54:50 paradigm system that he's created
01:54:52 which is all about don't spank kids
01:54:54 don't even yell at kids
01:54:56 don't even punish them, use reason, logic
01:54:58 and whatever the fuck which I'm really interested in
01:55:00 but I know
01:55:02 that if I say to my parents
01:55:04 the idea is to never spank kids
01:55:06 especially my mom is going to immediately
01:55:08 perk up and be like
01:55:10 no, right?
01:55:12 so I'm like trying to avoid saying that
01:55:14 but then like my fiance does
01:55:16 anyway she's like yeah the idea is to never spank kids
01:55:18 and my mom goes
01:55:20 try getting that to work on every kid you have
01:55:22 um
01:55:24 Davoo was abused
01:55:26 that's what we've learned here today
01:55:28 thank you for listening
01:55:30 should we move to questions
01:55:32 I want to say one last thing
01:55:34 my favorite thing to do
01:55:36 in Super Smash Brothers
01:55:38 is to throw the
01:55:40 ice item at
01:55:42 Princess Peach
01:55:44 hashtag
01:55:46 free speech
01:55:48 wait
01:55:50 free speech
01:55:52 free speech
01:55:54 there it is
01:55:56 classic hippo tweet
01:55:58 the first question
01:56:00 is from two weeks one spar
01:56:02 and I'm curious about this as well
01:56:04 is it too late for me to get into
01:56:06 rowdy fuckers cop killers lore
01:56:08 oh absolutely
01:56:10 no it is never too late
01:56:12 what do you have to do to get in
01:56:14 because I listened to the latest episode
01:56:16 not having heard the last few
01:56:18 and tried to join the discord
01:56:20 and it was totally incomprehensible
01:56:22 okay I would say that
01:56:24 in terms of what to listen to
01:56:26 probably the streams on twitch
01:56:28 are the best things
01:56:30 on twitch
01:56:32 on twitch slash rowdy
01:56:34 frickers cop killers
01:56:36 we tried to make it rowdy frickers cop killers
01:56:38 which literally would not allow us to have it
01:56:40 for the record cop killing is allowed on twitch
01:56:42 but fucking is strictly banned
01:56:44 did you guys see
01:56:46 what I told you that I deleted
01:56:48 last night
01:56:50 in the chat
01:56:52 please say that on the podcast
01:56:54 fucking embares yourself right now
01:56:56 this is amazing
01:56:58 so I've been doing
01:57:00 just blood borne videos
01:57:02 with May and so I just had the game
01:57:04 open and the recording software open
01:57:06 and she had gone to bed and I was listening to
01:57:08 rowdy fuckers cop killers and I wanted to make
01:57:10 a video explaining
01:57:12 why the PCPs quality
01:57:14 had sort of fluctuated so much over time
01:57:16 like what literal
01:57:18 physical things happened
01:57:20 such as that it used to be
01:57:22 that everyone was editing it
01:57:24 and like because
01:57:26 people were putting effort into the editing
01:57:28 and then that no longer became
01:57:30 incentivized or like
01:57:32 the people who were doing it weren't available to do it anymore
01:57:34 so now it's different and like
01:57:36 just things like that
01:57:38 you know I explained all of it
01:57:40 it was like 40 minutes long
01:57:42 and I edited it I listened to the whole thing back
01:57:44 I fucking created this video
01:57:46 started uploading it
01:57:48 and it was like 20% done
01:57:50 but like because of the fact that I'm doing
01:57:52 Let's Plays I'm just like trying to get all the footage on
01:57:54 and off my computer constantly
01:57:56 so I just deleted literally
01:57:58 everything while
01:58:00 it was still uploading not realizing
01:58:02 that it had not finished uploading
01:58:04 Jesus Christ did you I linked
01:58:06 a program that might be able to let you recover the files
01:58:08 it's possible it could theoretically be recovered
01:58:10 if you do it quickly how I
01:58:12 deleted everything like oh there's
01:58:14 it's a real thing deleted files
01:58:16 this is a program I link over Cuba
01:58:18 try it out it's possible
01:58:20 but yeah I
01:58:22 including the thumbnail and everything
01:58:24 like that because I had already uploaded
01:58:26 the thumbnail so single fucking piece
01:58:28 yeah I like damn spent like
01:58:30 15 minutes making a thumbnail
01:58:32 you look straight at the thumbnail for the video you were uploading
01:58:34 I'm like I don't need this anymore
01:58:36 yeah okay well let's
01:58:38 let's learn a lesson
01:58:40 and be a little more patient stop smoking weed didgy
01:58:42 look what it's doing to you
01:58:44 I was really tired at the time
01:58:46 but to the important question
01:58:48 to the important question rowdy fuckers cop
01:58:50 killer right you can watch the twitch
01:58:52 videos but mostly you got to join
01:58:54 the discord
01:58:56 pick up a weapon get in there
01:58:58 get in the dojo
01:59:00 pick up some cocktails and start doing
01:59:02 there's no like when you go into
01:59:04 the discord it doesn't give you like a pamphlet
01:59:06 explaining what the fuck's happening didgy
01:59:08 I'll explain to you right now there's basic training
01:59:10 there's the basic training room with a link
01:59:12 to the help document actually
01:59:14 crack is working on
01:59:16 crack is working on like a new website
01:59:18 that has like a more detailed like explanation
01:59:20 can you just make it I will explain it to you
01:59:22 right now I will explain to you right now
01:59:24 by which I mean he's hacking
01:59:26 okay
01:59:28 the rifle is cop killers
01:59:30 originally it was supposed to be a non-setting
01:59:32 and it was not supposed to have lore and I
01:59:34 specifically said this to bin that we should probably keep
01:59:36 just a grounded setting and unfortunately
01:59:38 even though I quite enjoy the lore
01:59:40 it's warped in this bizarre
01:59:42 like stealing your dad ripoff show
01:59:44 basically
01:59:46 it's still your dad painted green
01:59:48 but it's also canon to stealing your dad
01:59:50 no it's not
01:59:52 didn't it come into being before the lore of stealing your dad
01:59:54 no no
01:59:56 no it's not it's not at all
01:59:58 it's not you would make you change the lore
02:00:00 okay okay okay where's the lore of
02:00:02 stealing your dad deep in
02:00:04 the arizona desert where
02:00:06 the grand canyon exists
02:00:08 there's existed a town and that town had
02:00:10 nuclear a nuclear reactor on it
02:00:12 and that nuclear reactor spilled
02:00:14 and it flooded the entire grand canyon
02:00:16 with toxic waste a.k.a.
02:00:18 slime
02:00:20 and this slime was so valuable for
02:00:22 various obvious reasons
02:00:26 there's a specified obvious reasons
02:00:28 yeah yeah
02:00:30 but there was a city erected next to it
02:00:32 named we don't we're not entirely sure
02:00:34 some of the names are
02:00:36 slime city or neo los angeles city
02:00:38 or neo melwami
02:00:40 or neo guys i just want to let you know
02:00:42 every time i say the name of the city
02:00:44 i always say new los angeles city
02:00:46 a.k.a. neomilwaki
02:00:48 you have to say the whole thing
02:00:50 that is what i want to say for me
02:00:52 NO DO IT NO
02:00:54 okay the rest of the lore is this
02:00:56 this decay america's fastest
02:00:58 growing city is just a normal city
02:01:00 but it's green
02:01:02 and inside the city there exists
02:01:04 an obelisk with unknown
02:01:06 presumably extraterrestrial
02:01:08 properties known as endless war
02:01:10 who incentivizes violence
02:01:12 with his mere presence
02:01:14 me and bin in real life
02:01:16 have moved to slime city
02:01:18 to try and get rich
02:01:20 working the slime mines mine the valuable slime
02:01:22 and we've started a let's play
02:01:24 show for a leisure and that it
02:01:26 canonically exists within the world
02:01:28 and because me and bin presumably after playing
02:01:30 a heated match of super smash brothers
02:01:32 got really mad at each other but because we're such
02:01:34 pussies we didn't want to directly fight
02:01:36 one other so we rounded the local youth
02:01:38 and endangered
02:01:40 juveniles and forced them to do proxy
02:01:42 warfare because we're too close to fight each other
02:01:44 in real life
02:01:46 wait but do you guys like live and work together
02:01:48 in canon? yes
02:01:50 we live in a house to get our own apartment together
02:01:52 and we record let's plays on twitch
02:01:54 are the rowdies and the fuckers aware of this
02:01:56 that you like live together?
02:01:58 in the discord
02:02:00 in the streets
02:02:02 in the mean streets of slime city
02:02:04 is the discord literally a real
02:02:06 or is it a metaphor for a war
02:02:08 you're just going to have to find out
02:02:10 you're just going to have to find out
02:02:12 watch the streams
02:02:14 to find the place to do the
02:02:16 combat to pick a side
02:02:18 let me tell you this is a real thing
02:02:20 with real life consequence
02:02:22 because me and munchy released the new rowdy fuckers video
02:02:24 well I released whatever we did it
02:02:26 I released it the other day and in response to that
02:02:28 video coming out new people
02:02:30 joined the discord and the discord became more active
02:02:32 and this affected the slime economy
02:02:34 so much that slime stock
02:02:36 prices went through the roof
02:02:38 and the economy was destroyed
02:02:40 as certain people
02:02:42 as certain people became insanely wealthy
02:02:44 on the slime coin stock market
02:02:46 as a result in like a month or so
02:02:48 me and bin are going to have to fight
02:02:50 iron man style with at least
02:02:52 400 mucks in pokemon
02:02:54 at least 400 mucks
02:02:56 at least
02:02:58 hey guys it's me
02:03:00 no it's the lord of ghosts
02:03:02 no it can't be the lord of ghosts
02:03:04 he's so scary

02:03:10 he's a rowdy fuckers calculus character
02:03:12 it's the lord of ghosts

02:03:40 I'm gonna feed that right to the right fucking now
02:03:42 oh no I gotta get out of here
02:03:44 holy shit
02:03:46 what a haunting
02:03:48 rowdy the rowdy fucker conquered his fear
02:03:50 and drove away the lord of ghosts
02:03:52 this time
02:03:54 oh did I just miss the lord of ghosts
02:03:56 oh yeah but don't worry
02:03:58 I was just peeing
02:04:00 I have a feeling we'll see him again real soon
02:04:02 tune in to slime fest 2
02:04:04 yes
02:04:06 since we're on the subject of meta questions
02:04:08 and behind the scenes shit
02:04:10 Gwee Kale asks where's the bonus radcon 3 content
02:04:12 for non backers
02:04:14 we still haven't resolved it I don't think
02:04:16 there's no progress on the subject
02:04:18 good question I think we've all just
02:04:20 at least I've been wrapped up and there's still
02:04:22 some major videos to get done for it
02:04:24 but we really should just release that
02:04:26 in some fashion the typical thing
02:04:28 about all these kick starters is it's like
02:04:30 it's hard to say exactly when
02:04:32 is this
02:04:34 appropriate yeah when is this appropriate
02:04:36 to address when we still have like unfinished
02:04:38 business in doing the actual thing
02:04:40 you know
02:04:42 which we were all hard at work on by the way
02:04:44 the silly our dads are being aided currently
02:04:46 and I went into like a Ryers meeting
02:04:48 with Ethan and we went through it all
02:04:50 and we wrote down some jokes and funny shit to edit in
02:04:52 and so those will be out soon and they're looking
02:04:54 to be quite juicy
02:04:56 I mean to clarify
02:04:58 we have given like
02:05:00 all the bonus content has been released for
02:05:02 the Kickstarter people
02:05:04 it's just like we're deliberating whether or not
02:05:06 on when if we are
02:05:08 to like sell it to everyone else
02:05:10 yeah I mean I definitely want to
02:05:12 it's just the only mechanism I really
02:05:14 think that we have is to like make it some sort
02:05:16 of patron reward
02:05:18 but I don't want to like I don't know
02:05:20 that's kind of a weird way to handle it other than
02:05:22 that like I don't know how to like actually set up
02:05:24 like a purchase thing where someone can send us like let's
02:05:26 say five bucks
02:05:28 and then we give them all the videos in response
02:05:30 I don't know how to like do that so
02:05:32 I don't know we got a workshop something we
02:05:34 should talk about this tomorrow's meeting or something probably
02:05:36 Dan it's Jack you probably know something
02:05:38 send it to us yeah if you want to tweet at us
02:05:40 send us some ideas so we're already
02:05:42 two hours and seven minutes do we want more questions
02:05:44 or I got one question from the
02:05:46 from the from a pity question
02:05:48 for today from the Twitter at TP
02:05:50 crass tears hashtag ask BCP
02:05:52 here's a question at zoom
02:05:54 zyke asks what color
02:05:56 best embodies you as a person
02:05:58 and I just want to redirect you
02:06:00 to the newest episode of ready fuckers
02:06:02 cop killers where Ben and munchy go through
02:06:04 a big old breakdown of all the colors
02:06:06 associated with the people here are the
02:06:08 problem children here are the problems
02:06:10 yeah bow and digi are the problem
02:06:12 when when it comes to PCP
02:06:14 you say you say it's
02:06:16 you're the problem but you could just as easily
02:06:18 say that mage and Nate
02:06:20 are the problem well I mean
02:06:22 the reason that okay like munchy
02:06:24 and Ben were saying for example that they love
02:06:26 my color my bright green which I agree
02:06:28 is great and it like fits my stuff
02:06:30 it's whatever it's entrenched like give
02:06:32 it has always had this like
02:06:34 green but it is a grandfathered
02:06:36 in from the pony days Tom has never had
02:06:38 like a set color he was like blue as a pony
02:06:40 then he had the red with rebel pixels
02:06:42 just has gravitated in sky blue we all kind
02:06:44 of know this Ben is black and white munchy
02:06:46 is obviously pink and mage
02:06:48 insists on being an extremely
02:06:50 specific hexadecimal value
02:06:52 purple and everything so
02:06:54 see that's the thing is that like a mage
02:06:56 has like both mage and I
02:06:58 have historically like always been
02:07:00 like pink purple range
02:07:02 like that is true that she
02:07:04 back in the pony days to make you like
02:07:06 an indigo digi but it doesn't really
02:07:08 back in the pony days she was like a darker
02:07:10 like a deeper purple and I was
02:07:12 more of like the pinkish purple because
02:07:14 I had like the sweetie bell design and
02:07:16 everything on my pony yeah she's my
02:07:18 I mean but you know people
02:07:20 but yeah but like I mean like I've got
02:07:22 like the magenta meme thing right now
02:07:24 which I kind of want to lean in on because
02:07:26 I'm gonna make it like a relevant plot point
02:07:28 in my I think you should yeah
02:07:30 like good meme so yeah I that's
02:07:32 what we kind of settled on you on you
02:07:34 kind of like in between red and purple
02:07:36 okay I'm completely fine did you
02:07:38 with you also being purple in fact I
02:07:40 want that I think that is a good idea
02:07:42 but there just are so few
02:07:44 like cool colors it just
02:07:46 honestly I feel like what we're
02:07:48 the approach that you guys have taken
02:07:50 maybe reconsider the idea that like
02:07:52 we're trying to represent a whole range of
02:07:54 colors and more just that it's like
02:07:56 a set of like a palette
02:07:58 that complements each other yeah like
02:08:00 you know what you're deciding a ghibli movie
02:08:02 or something like you're just choosing colors that
02:08:04 go good together you know
02:08:06 yeah yeah that's pretty much I don't
02:08:08 know that they do well it's just
02:08:10 it's just kind of a lopsided rainbow
02:08:12 really yeah the
02:08:14 I'm like on the one side
02:08:16 you've got that you've got like the reds and the pinks
02:08:18 on the other sides and then you've got like the greens
02:08:20 I'm sort of saying that you can reconsider
02:08:22 the color design to be more like
02:08:24 that that it's it's less about
02:08:26 like having a breadth of
02:08:28 colors and more about creating an aesthetic
02:08:30 in the way that the colors blend
02:08:32 you know you know I really think
02:08:34 thinking about we should really make me like
02:08:36 I think we just have to change mage to be
02:08:38 like a deeper like purple blue
02:08:40 like she was in the 20 days
02:08:42 you're gonna she's gonna fucking riot
02:08:44 this is gonna be warfare in the streets
02:08:46 well that would help
02:08:48 so much wouldn't it because there would be more blue
02:08:50 let's okay here's what we need we just would
02:08:52 but we can't just we can't we can't
02:08:54 fucking miss color here's what we do
02:08:56 here's what we do hashtag
02:08:58 hashtag make mage orange
02:09:00 we need to start
02:09:02 she needs to become orange to fill
02:09:04 out our color palette that's what we're missing
02:09:06 we have yellow we have red
02:09:08 Ben is like Ben's like the hemospectrum car
02:09:10 cat where he's like the orange guy the time
02:09:12 for God and it's just become black and white
02:09:14 which is fine but we need a goddamn
02:09:16 orange and we got like hidden behind
02:09:18 my black and white runs the secret
02:09:20 one's the secret orange patreon
02:09:22 exactly I
02:09:24 actually great I take it back
02:09:26 Ben is now black white and a secret orange
02:09:28 he is the orange secret
02:09:30 agent
02:09:32 we hippo what what are you
02:09:34 what
02:09:36 just tell us
02:09:38 well I like the dark turquoise
02:09:40 I love that color
02:09:42 but I if if we
02:09:44 really need to change it I would
02:09:46 not mind going into a briska blue
02:09:48 oh
02:09:50 we don't have a dark because it is briska and it's also
02:09:52 hypocrite is
02:09:54 yeah yeah my channel
02:09:56 is blue themed
02:09:58 and I like briska so I like that
02:10:00 blue green
02:10:02 are we prepared to abandon the
02:10:04 decades long rise
02:10:06 to fame of Gibb and take the world's
02:10:08 greatest pony reviewer
02:10:10 Gibb and take has been a dead character for years
02:10:12 now like aside from Gibb and take lives
02:10:14 in the pony cast every week
02:10:16 with every new episode of my little pony god damn
02:10:18 like he just said he's never been a part
02:10:20 of the pcp though except for maybe
02:10:22 the one horse cast
02:10:24 Gibb and take is banned for the pcp
02:10:26 hypocrite is allowed in
02:10:28 blue themed like so
02:10:30 that's that's always been you know what
02:10:32 make it hashtag make Gibb blue
02:10:34 I like it I would think that if we needed
02:10:36 orange Nate has like plenty of orange
02:10:38 shit in his like I could not
02:10:40 no okay listen listen to me
02:10:42 I cannot be orange because of the communist
02:10:44 glasses meme I cannot be
02:10:46 orange it's unacceptable
02:10:48 I would die and plus like we need
02:10:50 that light green like nobody's like that kind
02:10:52 of green
02:10:54 I personally believe like
02:10:56 like you Nate
02:10:58 Ben
02:11:00 and like
02:11:02 I don't know maybe me are like the strongest
02:11:04 like no one can budge that like no one can budge
02:11:06 the next I love my
02:11:08 my bright green for the following reasons
02:11:10 one it is matched like the background color
02:11:12 of all the art since Ben first designed it
02:11:14 years ago to it is like
02:11:16 the color of spiral power which
02:11:18 I always think to myself whenever I look
02:11:20 at it and there's a third reason I can't remember
02:11:22 but those two are good enough
02:11:24 some other third yeah we'll ever change that
02:11:26 I wrote it down but I think like four reasons
02:11:28 I just like purple because I
02:11:30 associate it with dementia and that's
02:11:32 like I've always tried
02:11:34 to convey that my videos are
02:11:36 someone who's unhinged and lost their
02:11:38 mind and like that's like I want
02:11:40 that to be a constant presence felt in my
02:11:42 videos that like this guy might
02:11:44 be insane and that's why I've
02:11:46 always used purple theming except
02:11:48 for what I'm trying to be like accessible
02:11:50 like in the pony videos where I had green
02:11:52 so I was like that's why the after dark
02:11:54 videos were purple and the main channel videos
02:11:56 were green it was like oh
02:11:58 wait real quick I remembered what the third
02:12:00 point was because I looked it up it's that
02:12:02 the purple and pink of my avatars look really
02:12:04 good with yellow because it looks like delicious
02:12:06 watermelon that's that's oh I remember
02:12:08 when I was designing Wewaga though I specifically
02:12:10 was trying to make it a watermelon that's
02:12:12 right you did yep that's absolutely right
02:12:14 that's absolutely right yeah like greens
02:12:16 purples and pinks are like my my my
02:12:18 by the way did you I remember
02:12:20 this moment I stuck that with me in my mind for like many
02:12:22 a year where I sent you
02:12:24 like this in card featuring did you bro
02:12:26 did you brony in in a
02:12:28 in the background like a little of a bar
02:12:30 and you said that that was your favorite
02:12:32 thing that you've ever like I've ever
02:12:34 made was was fucking did you brony
02:12:36 in a bar and it was fun because
02:12:38 like I am super into
02:12:40 the aesthetic of bars
02:12:42 and like it was just a I mean
02:12:44 back then I didn't have shit tons of fan
02:12:46 art so I hadn't been presented in this way
02:12:48 over and over again like
02:12:50 now I have like hundreds of drawings of me
02:12:52 like smoking weed and drinking and all this
02:12:54 like people exclusively draw
02:12:56 me like doing those things now
02:12:58 but at the time it was like oh my god someone
02:13:00 finally drew me in a bar like this is where
02:13:02 my pony has always belonged
02:13:04 you know and like now we're finally here
02:13:06 hey here's a here's a funny
02:13:08 ish question anyone else want to comment on
02:13:10 this color thing
02:13:12 no okay great
02:13:14 I just want to say how much how glad
02:13:16 I am that I snatched up the black and
02:13:18 white yeah you really lucked out there's not
02:13:20 there's nothing else people would fight over that
02:13:22 like in like in Pulp Fiction
02:13:24 when they all not sorry Reservoir Dogs when
02:13:26 they all thought of her who'd be Mr. Black
02:13:28 but anyway yeah one spar and
02:13:30 with another question here asks during the
02:13:32 process of editing a video I find
02:13:34 that starting the render i.e. the wait
02:13:36 for hours button can feel relieving
02:13:38 at some times and anxiety inducing
02:13:40 at others but this is the this is the
02:13:42 interesting part do you have do any of you
02:13:44 also feel a specific way
02:13:46 when you initiate that process wait I
02:13:48 read that question wrong I thought it was do you
02:13:50 have a ritual that you do when you start
02:13:52 that process I'm gonna answer that question
02:13:54 because I like it better yes I
02:13:56 I relaxed
02:13:58 I crack open
02:14:00 a big
02:14:02 glass of water skull I smash
02:14:04 a glass of water
02:14:06 to get the jagged it I fill with water I take
02:14:08 a long deep draft
02:14:10 think that's the word for drink of it
02:14:12 I just lie down I just lie down
02:14:14 drink drink there well
02:14:16 I'm trying to flex my words
02:14:18 I just I just
02:14:20 I'm trying to express how relieved and
02:14:22 great I feel when I'm finally rendering
02:14:24 a video it's such a wonderful feeling for
02:14:26 me you really
02:14:28 you really remind me of the youtuber
02:14:30 CGP gray in a lot of ways
02:14:32 though though if you just took gray but
02:14:34 removed all like if you took name
02:14:36 removed all memes sure
02:14:38 get CGP gray okay
02:14:40 he's super methodical
02:14:42 I think it would really behoove you to listen to the first episode
02:14:44 of hillarine if you would get super inspired
02:14:46 he's very Spartan and
02:14:48 he does not
02:14:50 have anything unnecessary in his house
02:14:52 I'm gonna write that down
02:14:54 yeah if you were to like create a
02:14:56 spectrum of like
02:14:58 robot internet celebrities and CGP
02:15:00 gray is like pretty far in one
02:15:02 end and then like Maddox is completely
02:15:04 on the opposite end as far as you can possibly
02:15:06 go Nate is like
02:15:08 super like closer to CGP gray but
02:15:10 more in the middle I would say
02:15:12 robots
02:15:14 it's just how to deal
02:15:16 you know I was thinking about this I was
02:15:18 is this a thing I was thinking about dry
02:15:20 comedy and I'm like now man I'm into that
02:15:22 wet comedy I'm
02:15:24 I was at you I came
02:15:26 with that when I was like 12 okay that's
02:15:28 part of my I didn't I just want to say
02:15:30 somebody said that that spectrum that
02:15:32 Davoo just described like I was trying to
02:15:34 think like what is the meaningful
02:15:36 like putting those two people on opposite ends
02:15:38 of spectrum and it's just like literally
02:15:40 an insanity bar and he's putting you
02:15:42 in the middle of the insanity bar like
02:15:44 everyone here is insane just in like
02:15:46 well all of them are like human robots
02:15:48 but like CGP gray has actually
02:15:50 like completely thought out every
02:15:52 element of his and is like
02:15:54 actually just maximum efficient where it's
02:15:56 yours is like a somewhat warped like
02:15:58 halfway there like yeah I'm working on it
02:16:00 you know
02:16:02 yeah it's like if your robots fucking
02:16:04 CGP gray is like running like perfectly
02:16:06 corrected Linux and Maddox is running
02:16:08 like some fucking malware
02:16:12 my techniques and it's just a window
02:16:14 like he's a window it's not
02:16:16 a lean machine but he keeps the desktop
02:16:18 clean you know what I'm saying that's true
02:16:20 beautiful so my technique
02:16:22 for how to deal with the render is have a dopey premiere
02:16:24 because it renders shit I think
02:16:26 literally 10 times faster though every
02:16:28 times in Virginia when like Ben was
02:16:30 having to borrow my computer for rendering
02:16:32 Ben was like hey Davoo I gotta like render
02:16:34 this video literally all day okay
02:16:36 hold on give me a second to render this other
02:16:38 video extremely quickly in Adobe Premiere
02:16:40 before you turn on Sony Vegas and take
02:16:42 all day on rendering or something I actually
02:16:44 there's actually something fucked up with my computer
02:16:46 because I assembled it myself and then
02:16:48 shipped it around the country three goddamn
02:16:50 times so the fan
02:16:52 the CPU fan isn't quite fixed right so
02:16:54 I had to throttle the power of the
02:16:56 CPU to only work at like
02:16:58 80% of its capacity
02:17:00 until I could get that fan fixed
02:17:02 and even still Adobe Premiere
02:17:04 renders videos like five times faster
02:17:06 than Vegas would
02:17:08 so use Adobe Premiere to take the edge off
02:17:10 yep makes sense to me
02:17:12 agreed never um
02:17:14 when I render video but maybe
02:17:16 it's usually just like a sigh of relief like
02:17:18 yeah because I I mean
02:17:20 I edit really fast and I just tried it
02:17:22 like for me it's like the second I've made
02:17:24 the last edit if I I mean
02:17:26 well if I've watched it back
02:17:28 enough times that I don't want to have to watch the entire thing again
02:17:30 because chances are I watch it like
02:17:32 over and over again the whole time
02:17:34 I'm editing it so I know it's
02:17:36 done you know and then you write
02:17:38 you don't understand it with Adobe Premiere
02:17:40 render so fast I can just
02:17:42 render it before having to
02:17:44 watch it back I'll watch it back in the render
02:17:46 and redo the render sometimes
02:17:48 I just don't even bother because like
02:17:50 they the preview window can be so shit
02:17:52 in Vegas that like it's not even
02:17:54 you know it's actually I'm just looking back
02:17:56 at one's actual question and he's asking
02:17:58 like it could feel relieving it sometimes and anxiety
02:18:00 inducing at other times I
02:18:02 would assume that the anxiety part I mean
02:18:04 like getting a project done is just like pure
02:18:06 good feelings for me but the render
02:18:08 itself I remember when I was rendering
02:18:10 my my big funnel fancy lecture recently
02:18:12 that was like over a 24-hour render
02:18:14 so like that was very anxiety
02:18:16 inducing because I was afraid of knocking
02:18:18 my fucking connections and killing it
02:18:20 so I had to start all over in that sense
02:18:22 sure it could be anxiety
02:18:24 inducing I think it
02:18:26 can be anxiety inducing
02:18:28 when
02:18:30 you're not able to like
02:18:32 you're not at your fullest
02:18:34 of brainpower and so you have looked over
02:18:36 it to make sure that all the things are right but maybe
02:18:38 but you can't convince yourself
02:18:40 you can't convince yourself that it's actually
02:18:42 correct but you you can't waste
02:18:44 all day looking at it so you have to
02:18:46 press render but you just you're just not sure
02:18:48 good point it hasn't happened a whole lot
02:18:50 cause I'm not a mainly video guy
02:18:52 I have press rendered it's always the same
02:18:54 I'll press render I like
02:18:56 jump up like a fucking gunshot went off
02:18:58 I like run down the stairs I'll get some food
02:19:00 and I'll like I'll like stumble outside
02:19:02 just take a long walk while the video
02:19:04 renders because I've done my dues I'm not a video
02:19:06 person I don't care about editing just
02:19:08 like I've done it I've done my dues
02:19:10 I believe bye and then I fucking run out the door
02:19:12 yeah one thing
02:19:14 I do like doing after I hit render
02:19:16 hope we just power didn't go off or something
02:19:18 why
02:19:20 I wanted to say something that was related to him
02:19:22 because well when you
02:19:24 go ahead you're first ever
02:19:26 one thing I do like doing when I
02:19:28 hit render is usually
02:19:30 I have like multiple projects stacked on
02:19:32 top of each other and going on
02:19:34 like in my brain at the same time
02:19:36 so as soon as I've hit render on one
02:19:38 thing I'm like okay I can't really use my
02:19:40 computer but I really enjoy
02:19:42 like figuring out
02:19:44 how I can make progress on the next
02:19:46 project immediately
02:19:48 right if I'm still awake if I'm tired
02:19:50 then I go to bed if I'm hungry I get food
02:19:52 but I always want to like immediately work
02:19:54 on the next thing while the thing is
02:19:56 rendering because it's like a big old
02:19:58 like time
02:20:00 it's it's like it's like a ticking clock
02:20:02 you can get stuff done in this time frame
02:20:04 that's exactly how I feel that that's why
02:20:06 for example I really love working out
02:20:08 because working out gives me just an
02:20:10 hour and a half generally
02:20:12 three days a week that I can't do anything
02:20:14 but like just
02:20:16 think and I'll generally put on
02:20:18 podcast to listen to or something you know
02:20:20 what Nate I just realized I have that
02:20:22 exact same like time and I really
02:20:24 appreciate that but for me it's taking
02:20:26 a shit I take extra
02:20:28 ordinarily long you're gonna you're gonna get
02:20:30 the hemorrhoids if you shit too long dude
02:20:32 I think it has to do with you being
02:20:34 you start he stands up
02:20:36 I talked to my doctor
02:20:38 alright and my doctor said if you take
02:20:40 a long time to shit that that I was like
02:20:42 wait wait wait you mean just like if
02:20:44 I'm on the toilet for longer taken
02:20:46 a shit that's going to like increase
02:20:48 my chance of hemorrhoids just like literally
02:20:50 exactly yes that's what it is
02:20:52 yeah if you're straining on the toilet
02:20:54 yeah I just say it it's the incentive
02:20:56 to get off the toilet fast
02:20:58 I think it happens a lot more if you're
02:21:00 in your late teens I don't know about you guys
02:21:02 but I used to take super long shits when
02:21:04 I was in my late teens I would sit in
02:21:06 there for like 45 minutes and then like
02:21:08 eventually I just I think
02:21:10 just because I started eating more I don't
02:21:12 know better or my body stopped letting me
02:21:14 eat as bad as I was like
02:21:16 yeah I shit more
02:21:18 if people want I used
02:21:20 to do that because I would like get home from work
02:21:22 and I have my own bathroom and I'm just
02:21:24 I didn't even realize it because I was trying to
02:21:26 immediately get back to working on videos when I
02:21:28 get back from cleaning windows but you know
02:21:30 just my body requires break time so it
02:21:32 snuck that in under my nose and
02:21:34 if someone ever asks just how much time
02:21:36 did you spend sitting on the toilet after
02:21:38 shitting I could just
02:21:40 tell them I got to level 207
02:21:42 on candy crush with no power ups
02:21:44 indeed so hold on
02:21:46 the thing about rendering and nervousness
02:21:48 I did the only nervousness
02:21:50 I really have had in my youtube career
02:21:52 when it comes to finishing videos
02:21:54 it's just that I've it's just for the
02:21:56 when I started working for digi and then I have to be
02:21:58 sending them off to someone else who could sit
02:22:00 it back to be after like a day
02:22:02 that's the thing that was like the most
02:22:04 difficult is that like you're done with a video
02:22:06 but now you have to like wait for a
02:22:08 random time for someone else to
02:22:10 then see it and then approve or deny it
02:22:12 or like you might have to change something
02:22:14 and then like I could have completely moved on
02:22:16 to a different project by then right
02:22:18 but very recently I
02:22:20 finally attained enough confidence that I
02:22:22 know exactly what digi once that
02:22:24 like I don't have to worry about like
02:22:26 something blind sighting me 95% of the time
02:22:28 so that's nice
02:22:30 well guys if we're all done I want to
02:22:32 read this one final question
02:22:34 just bear with me for a second it's a little long but I think you'll appreciate it
02:22:36 it's from AJ Shoup and here it is
02:22:38 my friend

02:23:00 oh you know same old same old
