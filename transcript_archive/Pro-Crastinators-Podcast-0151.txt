00:00:00 Come on everyone sit down at this end, so that you can procrastinate along with me. You know I'm supposed to be working, but instead I'm watching PC.
00:00:11 Let's make this the mean cast. Let's get mean this episode.
00:00:15 No, I know.
00:00:16 Let's bully Mage.
00:00:18 Munchy, what are you fucking dissenting? You want to be the next bullied? You want to be bullied?
00:00:25 You want to be on the end of my Roth?
00:00:29 You're Roth.
00:00:30 I'm fucking Roth Munchy. I am fucking Roth and you're gonna know about it.
00:00:35 There's that movie 7 with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.
00:00:38 Yeah, I don't like it.
00:00:39 Remember at the end how Brad Pitt became Roth? That was pretty cool.
00:00:42 Oh yeah.
00:00:43 That's Ben.
00:00:44 Yeah.
00:00:45 Munchy killed his wife and put his wife's head in a box.
00:00:47 I became Roth by being Roth.
00:00:49 I really love the word Roth by the way.
00:00:51 Is it different from Roth?
00:00:53 Yeah, it's like the adjective.
00:00:55 Oh yeah.
00:00:56 If you have Roth then you are Roth.
00:00:58 I've always had an issue with the end of that movie but I'll save it for the podcast.
00:01:03 Okay, let's get into it.
00:01:04 Here we go. The 7 casts.
00:01:06 Oh, I'm interested. I just watched that the other day. It's a great movie.
00:01:09 God damn it.
00:01:10 Now we're waiting for Mage to get her shit together.
00:01:13 This is why Penalty. Bam.
00:01:16 Munchy opened the floodgates by informing her that we hadn't started yet.
00:01:22 This is why I was opposed to saying I think the penalty should have been we just don't inform her that we're all here.
00:01:27 You know she's not even going to say anything. She's going to be a typical Mage, typical Tom.
00:01:32 She's going to get in here.
00:01:33 That's why we shouldn't have said anything.
00:01:34 She's going to get in.
00:01:35 God damn it.
00:01:36 I mean we should just penalize people that don't talk.
00:01:39 That opens the floodgates to some complicated stuff.
00:01:42 What is the line between not talking enough and where is the line drawn there?
00:01:46 We just got to feel it out.
00:01:49 Okay, here's the thing.
00:01:51 If someone's there and they're present and they're engaged but they happen to be someone who doesn't talk that much
00:01:56 like Hippo sometimes is.
00:01:58 Mage literally sits and draws during the podcast.
00:02:01 Okay, see the thing like drawing or I think on occasion like Tom has like been programming
00:02:06 well that right there is not a full commitment to being on the episode.
00:02:10 I don't think that's cool.
00:02:12 I don't want to pick on the guy. God rest his soul because of the current complications
00:02:16 but there's been numerous times where Tom like has said literally nothing on a podcast.
00:02:21 Well again if he's there and he just doesn't have anything to say.
00:02:25 He's just showing up to siphon off some PCP panties.
00:02:29 Frankly, frankly, I think the quote-unquote flugger.
00:02:32 Not every time.
00:02:33 Not every time but there's been a few times.
00:02:35 Of course not.
00:02:36 Some of us talk more than others obviously but I can't believe someone.
00:02:38 What it really comes down to is
00:02:40 Hippo is fully engaged.
00:02:41 We need to decide is this a friendship cast or is this a like produce the best podcast possible cast?
00:02:47 Because you know there's a difference there.
00:02:49 Well I don't think there's a difference.
00:02:51 I don't think that makes a difference.
00:02:54 I think there's a balance there.
00:02:56 It can be a clusterfuck but obviously we all want it to be good.
00:03:00 Yes, I mean that's totally true.
00:03:03 But like if Mage, let's just say for example,
00:03:06 introduce yourself at the beginning and then just for example,
00:03:08 literally said nothing the whole episode and at the end said,
00:03:11 look what I draw while you guys were doing the podcast essentially.
00:03:15 It'd be like well how is that fair that this is like an equal share of the work?
00:03:21 Because it's clearly not.
00:03:22 Okay, I don't disagree there.
00:03:24 I just wouldn't use the same language.
00:03:26 I mean it's never been to that extent.
00:03:28 Well that's true.
00:03:30 So it's a bit of a dare I call that a straw man argument.
00:03:34 But if we started docking pay for people who aren't talking enough,
00:03:38 that would encourage more of a clusterfuck to like interrupt and stuff?
00:03:42 Yeah, and I don't know about all that.
00:03:44 Well I think people should be interrupting each other.
00:03:47 It's fine.
00:03:48 It's fine for people to interrupt each other.
00:03:50 It's fine.
00:03:51 No, interrupting is to an extent.
00:03:53 Interrupting sucks.
00:03:54 Yeah, to an extent.
00:03:55 It's bad for the podcast.
00:03:57 Hey Mage, we have not started yet.
00:03:58 Well actually we are technically recording and I encourage you to start doing so as well.
00:04:01 I am not recording.
00:04:02 But we will not actually start.
00:04:03 Okay, sick.
00:04:05 So here's a thought.
00:04:06 What we could do is just take this audio and just make it like a secret link on the thing.
00:04:10 It's like the secret precast cast or something.
00:04:13 But that would require extra work maybe.
00:04:15 Hold on.
00:04:16 I don't have any reservations.
00:04:17 I have no reservations.
00:04:18 That's fine.
00:04:19 Yeah, I don't know.
00:04:20 Me neither.
00:04:21 Me neither.
00:04:22 Well I guess we're all here now.
00:04:23 We can sync at this point and then start.
00:04:25 Wait, should we talk about what we were talking about before?
00:04:28 I mean, I don't think we have much to say.
00:04:30 Mage, we are currently riffing and raffin on the subject of how first of all, like is
00:04:37 it fair to dock someone's pay if the episode has not yet begun but like they show up before
00:04:44 the recording starts or they are late past the 10 minute thing.
00:04:47 Okay.
00:04:48 You know what?
00:04:49 I've actually revised my position because I think in the past we've said that like
00:04:54 technically there's a quality.
00:04:56 I think technically they qualify for a penalty but I think in the past we've said, okay,
00:05:00 we didn't actually start yet so it doesn't matter.
00:05:02 I basically agree with that personally.
00:05:04 Absolutely agree.
00:05:05 All right.
00:05:06 All right.
00:05:07 Yeah.
00:05:08 All right.
00:05:09 I've changed my mind.
00:05:10 The reason to have a penalty is so that like you did not contribute as much as the others.
00:05:15 That's how I think about it as well.
00:05:18 And I mean, like the greatest penalty of all I think should be if the others are organized
00:05:22 and they start the episode on time then you just don't get to join or if you do you're late.
00:05:26 I mean, I think that it's worth letting people join late as long as they know what they're
00:05:31 doing.
00:05:32 I actually kind of like when people join.
00:05:34 I just think, you know, if you weren't there when you were supposed to be and you joined
00:05:37 late, you know, you shouldn't get the full PC penny load for it.
00:05:42 I agree.
00:05:43 Yeah.
00:05:44 Okay.
00:05:45 Well, on the larger subject of like divvying up pay based on contributions, that's a whole
00:05:52 can of worms.
00:05:53 That is a whole can of worms.
00:05:55 Yeah.
00:05:56 So I'm not even prepared to get into that in a serious way here.
00:05:59 Although, Mage, do you feel that sometimes, I'm curious what your opinion would be on
00:06:04 this.
00:06:05 There have been occasions where you, you know, you generally don't talk as much as other
00:06:08 people in the podcast sometimes.
00:06:09 You and Tom.
00:06:10 You and Tom are the offenders.
00:06:11 And then at the end, you in particular have done this where you just, hey, like, hey guys,
00:06:15 look at the picture I drew, which kind of implies as opposed to being engaged in the
00:06:20 podcast.
00:06:21 Now I don't find this hugely offensive or anything, but it's like, it shows a distraction
00:06:26 and a deep prioritization of, you know, contributing to the show.
00:06:30 No, that's not how I do it.
00:06:33 I usually draw things to keep myself focused.
00:06:38 I do, I do listen to what you guys say is just sometimes I don't have anything to say
00:06:42 or it's hard to interject, especially when you guys are very...
00:06:48 There is a lot, there is a lot as, I noticed this editing, there is a lot of Mage trying
00:06:53 to interject and getting cut off and...
00:06:55 Okay.
00:06:56 Well, that's fair.
00:06:57 Okay.
00:06:58 I got two, I got two things to say about that.
00:06:59 One, I don't think the fact that you're drawing is necessarily a problem as long as you're
00:07:04 engaged.
00:07:05 Yeah.
00:07:06 You do try to interject.
00:07:08 I've seen this criticism in the comments and I'm going to echo it.
00:07:12 Instead of trying to interject with a, let me like, hey, I have something to say.
00:07:17 Just interject with the thing you have to say.
00:07:20 Then it won't be heard though.
00:07:22 Yes.
00:07:23 If you do it loud enough.
00:07:24 Just keep doing it.
00:07:27 Don't fucking take no for an answer.
00:07:29 I mean, I'd have to agree that that would be better, but you know, I get it.
00:07:34 I get it.
00:07:35 This is a sort of like social Darwinism, but I will say it's absolutely terrible when you're
00:07:42 like speaking and then someone like interrupts you and then like the conversation is completely
00:07:47 unsalvageable.
00:07:48 Yeah.
00:07:49 We've all got to deal with that.
00:07:51 It is like a Darwin.
00:07:52 It's like that.
00:07:53 It happens to everyone.
00:07:54 When you're talking and someone else is talking and you know that one of you has to give up
00:07:58 and stop talking and it's like a battle of wills for a little while.
00:08:01 Yeah.
00:08:02 I think once in a while, two people will be like so dead set on saying whatever they're
00:08:08 saying that they both talking and they can both clearly hear the other person talking,
00:08:11 but they're just going to keep going because it's like, no, fuck that.
00:08:15 And when that happens, like it's up to the editor to decide who is more important to
00:08:20 the conversation.
00:08:21 I don't think so.
00:08:22 I mean, if I'm the editor of that, just leave them both in.
00:08:26 That's the honest truth.
00:08:27 That's what happens.
00:08:28 Or at least cut it so that like it's one after the other.
00:08:31 I do a lot of like, I do a lot of fucking editing to make the podcast less terrible.
00:08:35 I don't.
00:08:36 I mean, yeah.
00:08:37 Fuck that.
00:08:38 It's not just about recapturing it.
00:08:39 It is like a product we're producing here.
00:08:41 So if you can make it like improved by spacing that, I think that's all fine and well.
00:08:45 I mean, I guess.
00:08:46 I think it legitimately impacts the like the quality of the show to have constant interruptions
00:08:52 and to have it be like talking over one another.
00:08:54 You can't really tell what's happening.
00:08:55 I don't think it's that bad.
00:08:56 I don't think it's where that talking over each other.
00:08:59 I mean, you see people complain about it, but every voice.
00:09:01 That's the main thing about the show.
00:09:02 It's core.
00:09:03 It's core to the show.
00:09:04 That happens every episode.
00:09:05 Wait, what's core?
00:09:06 Talking over other people?
00:09:07 Yeah.
00:09:08 Yeah.
00:09:09 Talking over each other.
00:09:10 Yeah.
00:09:11 Well, it's core to the show, but like, I mean, I'm really thinking that this is a product
00:09:12 if it can be improved by like de-overlapping people.
00:09:15 The product.
00:09:16 It's like a good thing to do.
00:09:17 I don't know.
00:09:18 To me, the product is we record ourselves talking for two hours.
00:09:22 It's not.
00:09:23 I mean.
00:09:24 There's probably an artistry there between balancing like friendly banter and then like
00:09:28 listenability.
00:09:29 I think there is something to be, there is probably a reason.
00:09:32 I don't know what the fuck I'm fucking going to say.
00:09:35 Because like if we were talking in person.
00:09:37 This is all going to the show.
00:09:38 If we were talking.
00:09:39 Yeah, this is all going to the show.
00:09:40 Yeah, this is all going to the show.
00:09:41 If we were all in a room together talking in person, there would be less interrupting
00:09:44 and the conversation would flow better.
00:09:46 That's true.
00:09:47 That's definitely true.
00:09:48 So talking over discord, a little lag in the interrupting that comes with this, there
00:09:50 has to be some kind of editing to sort of fix it to where it would be if we were actually
00:09:55 in a room together.
00:09:56 Hey, here's a question.
00:09:57 This is a phenomenon.
00:09:58 It seems like Jesse gets talked over more than anyone else.
00:10:02 And I've yet to figure out exactly why I might be, I mean, it might be because of lag because
00:10:07 he doesn't have like the worst connection.
00:10:09 Well, let me, let me, let me propose, let me propose a reversal of causality and cause
00:10:13 or causation cause and effect here.
00:10:15 Maybe he gets talked over more because he tries to interrupt more.
00:10:20 Could that be the case?
00:10:21 He went robo.
00:10:22 I'm not.
00:10:23 I'm not.
00:10:24 I'm not.
00:10:25 I'm not.
00:10:26 I'm not calling Jesse an interrupting mean man or anything, but maybe he could be getting
00:10:33 talked over more because he's attempting to interrupt more.
00:10:35 I don't, I suppose it's possible.
00:10:37 I mean, I feel like I, if two people are talking about something, I try to stay out of it unless
00:10:42 I really have something.
00:10:44 I don't think I interrupt more than anyone else.
00:10:46 Again, that's not me saying Jesse, stop interrupting.
00:10:48 I don't think that's a problem at all.
00:10:51 I don't know.
00:10:52 But I do, and if I am interrupting, then I do hate myself and I will lash myself with
00:10:58 the fucking cat and nine tails.
00:11:01 Maybe it's that you're more courteous than like someone like me where I will just, I
00:11:06 don't give a fuck and I'll keep going, but you're like, well, I'm going to let this person
00:11:10 speak and I'll let them go first.
00:11:11 Maybe you're just nicer in conversation.
00:11:13 That's possible.
00:11:14 I don't know.
00:11:15 I'm a little known badass.
00:11:17 You might call me a badass.
00:11:19 That's what I am.
00:11:20 Can I get the Urban Dictionary definition of a conversation, please?
00:11:23 Let me pull that up.
00:11:24 I feel kind of lost right now.
00:11:25 Should we start recording?
00:11:26 Oh my God, Ben!
00:11:27 You motherfucker!
00:11:28 No, no, no, no, no.
00:11:29 I didn't mean recording.
00:11:30 I mean, like, start the actual episode.
00:11:33 I mean, this is, we should put this in.
00:11:35 We should, we just haven't synced yet.
00:11:37 Oh, is this going in?
00:11:39 Oh, this is going in.
00:11:41 Yeah.
00:11:42 Let's fucking put it in.
00:11:43 Hey, here's the thing.
00:11:44 Okay.
00:11:45 Conversation, Urban Dictionary.
00:11:46 We're doing it, people.
00:11:47 The act of hooking up with one, usually in a sexual fashion.
00:11:51 That's the definition of a conversation.
00:11:53 Whoa, wait.
00:11:54 What the fuck?
00:11:55 That's what we're just doing this whole time?
00:11:57 Oh, no!
00:11:58 No!
00:11:59 Listen to these examples.
00:12:00 One, man, did I get some good conversation last night?
00:12:04 And then, leave us alone.
00:12:05 We're having a deep conversation, Nate says, as Munchy burst into his sex dungeon.
00:12:11 Gross.
00:12:12 I think the ideal podcast format is where people can have a thought and then say that
00:12:24 thought to completion and then have it be discussed instead of saying like a quarter
00:12:28 of the thought, having people interrupt and then say another quarter of the thought.
00:12:33 And then the conversation completely derail and you go into another topic before the
00:12:36 other one can even be finished.
00:12:37 I think that interruptions are not a great thing in general, but when two people are
00:12:44 clashing and they're trying to argue each other and shouting over each other, I think
00:12:48 that that, you know, in a way, I almost see it as like a historical record.
00:12:55 That sounds a little grandiose, but it's like this is a record of what the conversation
00:12:59 was and how it happened.
00:13:02 Yeah, but it does get hard to listen to.
00:13:04 When people are talking to each other and like stuttering and like trying to interjecting
00:13:07 and failing, like all that stuff I think should, some effort should be put into having it all
00:13:12 cut out.
00:13:13 And that's one of the things that we should be looking for in an editor is that kind
00:13:16 of audio engineering, making it all so unclean and, you know, making sure that we don't sound
00:13:22 like inarticulate fucking baboons.
00:13:25 What I think is really interesting learning like, like, like, like, like, like, like,
00:13:29 like, for example, when you start a sentence and you have to say the same word over and
00:13:31 over again because you don't know what the fuck your brain is doing yet.
00:13:33 Like when you do that, you just, I would like cut all the likes prior to the first to the
00:13:38 end like, you know what I'm saying, that's high level shit there.
00:13:44 Make it sound like I'm not stuttering like an electrocuted retard.
00:13:47 I might have a slightly lower threshold of stuff I'd cut with something like that, but
00:13:51 I get the idea.
00:13:53 It's all about, you know, what you want to do with it and how you want it to come out
00:13:55 in the end.
00:13:56 Other podcasts record for so fucking long and it's really strange.
00:14:01 I recorded a podcast with this guy low art on YouTube.
00:14:05 I recorded that like maybe two months ago and the guy is still like, I mean, yeah,
00:14:12 looking on it.
00:14:13 Other people, other people like edit their podcasts and like, I don't, I kind of don't
00:14:17 get it.
00:14:18 No, that's good.
00:14:19 Okay.
00:14:20 Okay.
00:14:21 Other people who report podcasts for like a living.
00:14:22 Well, no, no, no.
00:14:23 For so long.
00:14:24 I listened to the Penny Arcade DLC podcast and they don't edit that at all.
00:14:30 Just a conversation between them and it's fine.
00:14:32 Like there's no pauses.
00:14:33 There's no gaps.
00:14:34 Are you sure though that there's literally no improvements made in the editing process?
00:14:39 I guess I can't be a hundred percent sure because I know that like, for example, Sam
00:14:44 Harris and his waking up podcast, like he treats it like a product that they like curate
00:14:47 to like make better and remove like to try to keep all the content.
00:14:51 Some podcasts are highly like there's one called the relentless picnic that it has like
00:14:56 musical interludes that are definitely like points where they like broke the conversation
00:15:01 and restarted and stuff.
00:15:03 And others just, I don't know, others just aren't like that.
00:15:06 And we are far on the other end of the spectrum.
00:15:08 You know, Ben, when you and I did T-Bap originally, like that was something that I went through
00:15:13 and I did like improve the audio by cutting out like ums and us and pauses to make it
00:15:19 into like, but that was essentially podcast format.
00:15:22 We just would put the animation.
00:15:23 Okay.
00:15:24 So guys would be shocked if you saw like my biggest timeline of like how I, cause I mean
00:15:30 it takes me in probably Thursday night to finish these things.
00:15:33 And I fully admit, it probably takes me too long.
00:15:35 Like if we were paying an editor and they did it the way I do it, we wouldn't be paying
00:15:39 them enough and we would never pay them enough and I would never want to.
00:15:42 Who's working too hard?
00:15:45 I don't win T-Bap, but like I'm proud of it.
00:15:47 Like when I'm done, even if it takes me all week to make it how I want it to sound, I'm
00:15:52 proud of it at the end.
00:15:53 But it's, it's a weird thing because we're looking for an editor.
00:15:58 It's a weird thing to say like, I want you to edit it good.
00:16:01 And if it's not good enough, I'll fucking kill you.
00:16:03 But don't think that we're paying you more if you edit it good because we're too cheap
00:16:09 to do that.
00:16:10 Well, you know what I mean?
00:16:11 We want them to take pride in their work, you know.
00:16:13 I want to say, I want to say about T-Bap, about T-Bap.
00:16:15 I want to say good, but the better it is the more we have to pay them.
00:16:17 We would break T-Bap up with like scripted segments.
00:16:21 Like we would, we would come up with jokes as we were going to be like, hold on, stop
00:16:24 the recording and then let's, let's, let's read these lines to make a joke in the middle
00:16:28 of it.
00:16:29 Or whatever.
00:16:30 We did it in a good way.
00:16:31 So it was okay.
00:16:32 Fair enough.
00:16:33 I think a lot of the time, good podcasting is a lot like good writing where most of
00:16:36 it is like recording for like hours on end and then in the editing room just cutting
00:16:40 out swabs of other interesting motion.
00:16:42 It's made in the editing.
00:16:43 We got to, we got to find the podcast in the editing guys.
00:16:46 You know, I agree.
00:16:48 This is, this is, you know, when I'm working with like Digi on like our Shearles, Shield
00:16:52 Hero podcast or whatever, Digi's a guy who I, I have a lot of admiration for this aspect
00:16:57 that he just doesn't give a fuck.
00:16:59 He just throws in the editing bay, puts one image, it's done.
00:17:03 And frankly, he does it in an unbelievably short amount of time and I'm huge, I have
00:17:07 a small degree of admiration for that, but mostly fear and disgust of that.
00:17:11 That's fair.
00:17:12 Wait, fear of what?
00:17:13 The jealousy of what now?
00:17:14 Fear of Digi not giving a fuck what goes up.
00:17:17 Like his output, his output rate is like can, can absolutely be through the roof and on
00:17:21 something like that.
00:17:22 Like the other day I finished recording, I walk in to like see Michelle, I'm like, Hey,
00:17:25 just finish this Shield Hero.
00:17:26 And like before I said like one fucking word, the podcast was up and we're like, what the
00:17:31 Digi, how did you do it?
00:17:32 Well, I mean, if the conversation doesn't have like a bunch of breaks and things you
00:17:35 have to edit around, then you don't have to edit it.
00:17:37 You just put it on the video and render it and put it on the internet.
00:17:41 Well, any of them can be improved if you like wanted, like there's gonna be one bad breath
00:17:46 that you could cut out to like, you know, make it a little bit better.
00:17:48 Oh, I don't know.
00:17:49 That's, that's sort of persnickety.
00:17:51 That's so persnickety.
00:17:52 Like I, I mean, I don't know if it's better, it's better.
00:17:54 I listen.
00:17:55 I, I mean, I'll just, I'll just say it.
00:17:56 I did not do hardly any like audio editing person other than like getting the volume
00:18:01 equal on what I, on the episodes that I edited.
00:18:05 And I don't think they were that worse for it.
00:18:07 I don't think they were that worth it for it.
00:18:09 What's that?
00:18:10 Say to Jesse.
00:18:11 Well, Ben's episodes look good at least cause he can draw.
00:18:14 I did do it.
00:18:15 I did do.
00:18:16 Man, I really like the, I really like the outline sort of what you've been doing on
00:18:20 the recent ones, like the light sort of wire frame versions of us.
00:18:24 I don't know what you, you, you, you mean like with the mouths moving and everything?
00:18:27 Yeah.
00:18:28 Just like the different colored outline.
00:18:29 Yeah.
00:18:30 I thought those looked pretty cool.
00:18:33 And I got to say, like I knew, okay, after a while, after I'd done a few of those, I
00:18:38 knew how to get the mouths moving.
00:18:39 And it was, it was a long process to like figure out the method to do it.
00:18:43 Once I figured it out, it was not that hard, but it was extremely like, it was extremely
00:18:48 time intensive because I would have to render each individual mouth with its own video track
00:18:53 overlaid over the thing.
00:18:55 And then I would have to put them all in and then render it in, not in Vegas, but I would
00:19:00 have to render each one as like a fucking high res, like not an MP4, like a T2F or whatever.
00:19:10 And like something, something would always go wrong.
00:19:13 And it would always take me like days and days of rendering, seeing a what fucked up
00:19:17 this time.
00:19:18 Okay.
00:19:19 Got to do it again.
00:19:20 It would like, like I could explain how to do the mouth matching up thing pretty simply.
00:19:26 It's not, there's not that many steps to it.
00:19:28 It would just take forever, every time I would be enraged every single time.
00:19:33 I was like, oh, I should be done by now.
00:19:35 I'm getting flustered just thinking about making those.
00:19:41 And there that's what I have to say about that.
00:19:43 Fair enough.
00:19:44 Hey, how about we sync?
00:19:45 Why don't we sync?
00:19:46 Oh yeah.
00:19:47 Let's sync on the count of three.
00:19:48 Wait, wait, wait.
00:19:49 Is Hippo joining?
00:19:50 He's in the call.
00:19:51 No, he said now he'll just listen.
00:19:53 All right.
00:19:54 Okay.
00:19:55 On the count of three, let's say sync.
00:19:56 Here we go.
00:19:57 One, two, three.
00:19:58 Sync.
00:19:59 One more time.
00:20:00 One, two, three.
00:20:01 Sync.
00:20:02 I remember.
00:20:03 I don't know if we're going to cut this part out or should we, I think we should just upload
00:20:08 the whole thing of this.
00:20:09 Yeah.
00:20:10 This has to be the first part of the podcast.
00:20:11 Have it cold open for us.
00:20:12 I'm working to save up podcasts.
00:20:13 Well, there's a point of the pre-rambled.
00:20:14 Well, the point was it was a candid conversation that was relatively entertaining.
00:20:22 Hey, if you like what you heard so far, give us $5 on procrastinators.com slash Patreon
00:20:28 to hear the bonus episode where we do the same thing.
00:20:32 Yeah, that's true.
00:20:33 Donate to our PayPal.
00:20:34 Yeah, that's true.
00:20:35 Appropriate plug.
00:20:36 I remember.
00:20:37 I had a sort of digi-style editing process when I, back when I did Armory Triple and
00:20:40 stuff like that and like Jimmy Blockets and stuff, where like most of the editing was
00:20:46 creating the image that would be on the screen.
00:20:49 And then basically like that was it, like for Armory Triple editing, here's like all
00:20:53 I did, like for like the audio editing and stuff like that was I sunk up everyone and
00:20:59 then I like I compressed the IA levels, but I probably didn't even do that right.
00:21:03 I just did it like to ear and then I exported it all in one big audio file, put that like
00:21:09 I did that on audacity, then I just put it into like a video editing thing.
00:21:12 And then I spent like two hours making an image and then just put that in there and
00:21:16 then it was done.
00:21:17 Like that's all I did.
00:21:18 Like the actual like assembly and everything took maybe five minutes, maybe.
00:21:21 That's me.
00:21:22 That's me editing.
00:21:23 Yeah, that's good.
00:21:24 That's good.
00:21:25 Hey, speaking of editing that took forever, you want to talk about 10 paces?
00:21:30 Hell yeah.
00:21:31 Do you want to chat about 10 paces?
00:21:33 Because I do it.
00:21:34 It was a lot of fun.
00:21:35 Was chipping away on that for like months.
00:21:37 It came out.
00:21:38 It was good.
00:21:39 You know what?
00:21:40 Okay.
00:21:41 I want to say it was good.
00:21:42 Yeah, we all know that.
00:21:43 But I want to say how it was.
00:21:44 Red country!
00:21:45 But it was pretty good.
00:21:47 But.
00:21:48 Okay.
00:21:49 No, no, no.
00:21:50 That's actually the opposite.
00:21:51 I'm actually just saying it was pretty good and more on top of that, actually.
00:21:56 It was actually fantastic and way better than what we recorded, I feel.
00:22:02 This was the Star Wars of our generation.
00:22:04 This made it funny, something that wasn't really funny and kind of a cluster.
00:22:08 When?
00:22:09 Okay.
00:22:10 It really came off to me.
00:22:11 It felt like a real, like a TV show almost.
00:22:12 That's, yeah.
00:22:13 For sure.
00:22:14 When?
00:22:15 Okay.
00:22:16 When?
00:22:17 I like the digi in the background when you guys were talking.
00:22:18 Just slinking into the fridge and then slinking back.
00:22:21 There's a bunch of us, other people lurking in the background because we were all just
00:22:26 in the same room all the time.
00:22:29 Okay.
00:22:30 Munchy, you and I both came up with the idea, right, Munchy?
00:22:33 Of course.
00:22:34 Yeah.
00:22:35 We like.
00:22:36 I approached you with an idea for a draw cast where we fought each other.
00:22:41 It was like a round-based thing where it's like a companion tournament thing.
00:22:46 Yeah.
00:22:47 And then me and you just spent the first couple days of Recon 3 being like, what if, like,
00:22:51 what if, like, dude, like, what if, and then they just sprouted out of that.
00:22:56 Good times.
00:22:57 Good times.
00:22:58 Yeah.
00:22:59 I remember when we were thinking of it, I wanted it to be, I just, I wanted it to be
00:23:05 like strip search.
00:23:06 I just, I wanted, I wish so hard that I could have been in strip search that I just had.
00:23:10 Strip search came up many times in the conversation.
00:23:12 That I just, I had to make my own strip search, but with me in it.
00:23:15 So I was thinking like, how, how could I make this like look and feel like strip search
00:23:19 felt?
00:23:20 And, and the answer was like, spend a ton of effort like trying to edit it as professionally
00:23:26 as possible.
00:23:27 Like I learned, I learned the master class technique of the, letting the audio lead the
00:23:32 cut.
00:23:33 I learned.
00:23:34 That's Ben.
00:23:35 That's the thing I've wanted to do.
00:23:36 I've never actually done that.
00:23:38 And I was very impressed that you use that.
00:23:40 It's a pretty basic technique, but I was like, there he goes, being a real edit boy.
00:23:43 I learned that from a, oh God, in not innuendo studios, um, uh, oh fuck.
00:23:49 Who's that?
00:23:50 Dan Olson.
00:23:51 No, fuck.
00:23:52 There's some guy.
00:23:53 Acroid?
00:23:54 No.
00:23:55 There's some fucking guy on YouTube whose videos I watch and he talks about editing
00:23:58 somewhat, um, uh, folding ideas, folding ideas, talked about letting the,
00:24:02 Oh yes.
00:24:03 Three arrows?
00:24:04 No.
00:24:05 The German alt left YouTuber?
00:24:06 No.
00:24:07 But he's cool too.
00:24:08 Um, anyway.
00:24:09 Yeah.
00:24:10 So that was, yeah, that's, that's just like one weird trick.
00:24:13 That's like letting the audio leave the cut is like one weird trick that I completely abused
00:24:17 in like so many shots.
00:24:18 I just did the same thing over and over again.
00:24:19 I learned one weird old trick to obliterate the YouTube algorithm and shoot to the top
00:24:24 of the charts.
00:24:25 I'm Google searching like hot tips and tricks, how to make sexy YouTube video right now.
00:24:31 Give me 10 tips right now.
00:24:33 Let the audio leave the cut.
00:24:35 Um, you know what's embarrassing?
00:24:37 That's nothing else.
00:24:38 That's all you got.
00:24:41 You know what I just figured out about editing?
00:24:43 It's really embarrassing that it took me this many years of editing professionally to realize
00:24:47 this.
00:24:48 But, uh, when the, when the sound peaks and it has the red number, like the, the red
00:24:54 decimal number, that the decimal number is exactly as many decimals as you have to turn
00:25:02 it down to make it not peak anymore.
00:25:04 I had no idea.
00:25:05 I'm glad that, that other people besides me hadn't figured that out yet.
00:25:08 I don't know.
00:25:09 I know when it's red, you got to lower it to make it not peak, but.
00:25:12 I knew that when it's red, you have to lower it, but I always like just kind of did it
00:25:15 like blindly like an idiot.
00:25:16 Wait, are you talking about it in Vegas?
00:25:17 Yeah, in Vegas.
00:25:18 Yeah, in Vegas.
00:25:19 Huh.
00:25:20 Like I would always, like my whole career, I've been like, ah, it's red.
00:25:22 I got to turn it down some, you know, it was always turn it down some, but like I actually
00:25:26 looked at it one day and I'm like, wait a minute.
00:25:29 There's a, there's a decimal number there.
00:25:31 I wonder if I turn it down exactly to that amount of decimal and like sure enough, it
00:25:37 tells you exactly how much you need to turn it down.
00:25:40 Maybe, maybe, maybe we're all dumb as fuck for not noticing that earlier, but.
00:25:44 I noticed the numbers.
00:25:47 I just also didn't, you know, didn't put two and two together.
00:25:51 That's so weird.
00:25:52 I want to continue going up to bat for, for fucking 10 bases and draw by last week.
00:25:56 Yeah.
00:25:57 I wanted to keep coveching about how much work it was.
00:26:00 Okay.
00:26:01 That, that right there.
00:26:03 Like sure, we can all like joke like, ha ha, it took so long, but like the actual editing
00:26:09 of it, I feel was most likely well-spent, you know.
00:26:12 It was straight up professional level editing, basically, um, unironically.
00:26:16 It's not, okay, it's not as though Ben was working on 10 paces draw for a year in the
00:26:22 sense that every day would clock in.
00:26:24 No.
00:26:25 Sure.
00:26:26 How long would you say it was of actual work time?
00:26:29 Um, like combined actual work time?
00:26:31 Yeah, it might have been a hundred, a hundred, I don't know, somewhere in that ballpark.
00:26:38 Yeah, right.
00:26:39 All right.
00:26:40 I put it, I put it all, I put off even starting it for a long time.
00:26:44 Right.
00:26:45 That's the main thing right there.
00:26:46 I think a lot of people in the audience and just abroad may not realize this about like
00:26:51 being like an online, you know, free flowing, free form kind of guy that projects are extremely
00:26:58 fluid and you can, you can like be working on something for a really long time and not
00:27:04 drop it.
00:27:05 Just have more things take up the priority queue of your mind and therefore, and when
00:27:11 you come back to it in like two months after where people have like forgot about or think
00:27:14 you're not releasing it, but it's just you're doing other things and like, are you supposed
00:27:18 to make a Twitter post that like, hey guys, switch over to this also in the next day and
00:27:23 then I switch over to this and then I switch over to this and then, and then I came back
00:27:26 to this for a little while, you know, it's a slow grind to do some of these long, you
00:27:30 know, effortless projects.
00:27:31 Yeah.
00:27:32 A lot of the time people will say like, oh, I've been working on this for years and
00:27:34 like, you know, a lot of the time it's like, well, you weren't, you weren't literally working
00:27:38 on it for years.
00:27:39 You like, maybe you started it years ago or you had the idea years ago and maybe you
00:27:42 worked on it some of the time and then other times you had other things that had to take
00:27:45 priority over it.
00:27:47 That being said, I just came out of a particularly grueling process making something for endless
00:27:53 war, which will be out by the time, I mean, it'll be out like, oh, was it, was it World
00:27:57 Famous Comic Nuts the beginning?
00:27:59 Yes, it was actually.
00:28:01 Did you like it?
00:28:02 I made it, I made it for you.
00:28:04 I didn't, I was very, I wasn't very impressed.
00:28:06 It was kind of fucked up that you put that on the Patreon actually, it kind of fucked
00:28:08 up that you put that on your Patreon.
00:28:10 Yeah, I don't, I mean, I just thought my patrons might appreciate your hard work on that one.
00:28:18 But that's the same, that's similar because, because someone, someone made, or I made the
00:28:21 joke like a month ago or more about the whole like, the difference between the timelines
00:28:26 is that real Ben St. likes salted almonds and cop, and the cop killer likes unsalted
00:28:31 cashews.
00:28:32 And I was like, that'd be really funny to turn into a comic where that's the joke.
00:28:35 Oh, that was the genesis, okay.
00:28:37 And so I started it like back then, and then I did a bit of it, had dropped it for some
00:28:41 other stuff, forgot about it a little bit until someone brought it.
00:28:44 And I was like, I got to finish that.
00:28:45 And then I stayed up for like two days, like a day and a half straight, like yesterday,
00:28:49 I didn't sleep, just like worked on it for the whole time, because I was, I was like,
00:28:52 I'm so close.
00:28:53 I'm so close to it.
00:28:54 I just got to keep going.
00:28:56 And I did, and I banged it out, and I made sweet gifts, and the art is rad at point.
00:29:01 Sometimes it's terrible, and other times it's great.
00:29:03 And I was like, job well done, and it felt good.
00:29:06 I have just gotten out of creating an update, which is fairly big.
00:29:11 I mean, there's no reason to be candid about it since they will know.
00:29:13 You mean a code update?
00:29:15 Yeah, a code update to Endless War.
00:29:19 It took such a frankly, like embarrassing time, it took maybe like four, no, three weeks
00:29:28 of making where I added a ton of shit, not most interesting of which, the fairy in three
00:29:35 new districts, and rebalancing and adding a lot of new flavor text for whatever, doesn't
00:29:38 matter.
00:29:39 Specifics.
00:29:40 I'm saying, is that-
00:29:41 Finally, the coveted fairy.
00:29:42 All that is good.
00:29:43 Finally, the fairy is running.
00:29:44 That is good.
00:29:45 It's been out of commission for so long.
00:29:48 But, okay, and the most weird thing about it is that I was working on it, like every
00:29:54 single day, this update ruined my latest trip to Boston, which we'll get into later.
00:30:01 Every single day, I was sick trying to work on this, just plowing through fucking dozens
00:30:08 upon dozens of flavor texts, which I didn't need to do.
00:30:11 This is the thing.
00:30:12 I was working hard, but I wasn't being productive.
00:30:16 What I was doing didn't fucking matter at all.
00:30:19 I'm sure people will go around the district, collect on the new flavor texts, and they'll
00:30:23 be like, ha, ha, cool, does not matter at all, did not need to happen.
00:30:28 I made the actual code for everything, like first couple days, changed a little bit of
00:30:35 it here and there.
00:30:38 But actually, making the majority of every fucking, for the past five days, since I got
00:30:47 back, since I fucking got back on the 12th, literally every single day, I would get up,
00:30:53 just like work literally all day, and then turn in at night, just constantly rewriting
00:30:59 fucking, yeah, like literally five days.
00:31:02 It's only five days.
00:31:04 Well, what?
00:31:06 Well, okay, I'll tell you what.
00:31:07 That's a long time.
00:31:08 In my mind.
00:31:09 This is very interesting, because I just...
00:31:10 That's a long time to be on like a 12 hour a day work schedule.
00:31:14 Yeah.
00:31:15 Well, I mean, okay, that's interesting that you say, because I actually too, just finished.
00:31:19 It's coming out at 5 p.m. the day of recording.
00:31:22 This is my longest edited video ever that's not a lecture, and it's the Kingdom Hearts
00:31:27 3 Weagawa, and I put in such an absolutely unnecessary amount of effort and work into
00:31:34 it.
00:31:35 And the reason was because in my mind, it was easier to just go along with the tide
00:31:40 of like, look, it's already there, just like add stuff here, make a little edit there.
00:31:45 And no way was I fighting against my just desire to just add things to it.
00:31:50 For the common sense approach of like, Nate, you do not need to do all this.
00:31:53 Just make a shorter video and get it out, talk about less things.
00:31:57 It's fine.
00:31:58 You can make another video later.
00:31:59 You will make more money.
00:32:00 You will get more views.
00:32:01 People will like that better.
00:32:03 No one or less people will sit through a long video anyway, probably.
00:32:08 So just do all these good things.
00:32:09 And I even made a fucking trailer for it, which was just for fun and was dope.
00:32:14 But what it is, it was the capstone to the Nate Power Creep arc when it comes to Weagawa,
00:32:22 as I was saying before the show.
00:32:23 So you leaned into the power, wait, you mean feature creep?
00:32:25 Well, both.
00:32:26 It's both the power creep and feature creep arc.
00:32:28 The power level has never been higher, but it needs to go back down because the bosses
00:32:32 are, we're in Dragon Ball Z levels, we're like, okay, we already know they can blow
00:32:37 up a planet.
00:32:38 How much more visually can you convey that this guy's way double, triple stronger than
00:32:42 the last guy was?
00:32:43 That's what Weagawa's become.
00:32:44 Okay, so I know what a power creep is.
00:32:46 What's that other creep?
00:32:48 Feature creep.
00:32:49 It's in a game when like, it's when development just goes, just balloons out to be longer
00:32:56 and longer and longer because they just keep adding stuff, bells and whistles.
00:33:01 So you played Terraria, right?
00:33:03 You played Terraria, right, Mage?
00:33:05 Uh, a little bit, not much.
00:33:06 Everything after hard mode is feature creep.
00:33:08 People will understand that.
00:33:09 I haven't played that much, but yeah.
00:33:11 Well, okay, hey, okay.
00:33:12 On the subject of Nate's power creep arc, let me just say that since, you know, this
00:33:16 is where people come and make fun of me for, you know, saying it's going to be done and
00:33:19 I fail.
00:33:20 I want everyone to know that I'm always telling the truth that I think that it will be done
00:33:25 at a certain time.
00:33:26 I'm just so fucking bad at it.
00:33:27 I'm unbelievably terrible at judging time and distance and I'm so sorry, everyone.
00:33:32 But the good news is, the good news is, this is the end of the feature creep arc of Weagua.
00:33:38 I have a new plan.
00:33:39 It will begin shortly and it will be, it's actually going to be bi-weekly videos is the
00:33:45 plan, not actually weekly.
00:33:46 So they'll continue to roast me for that.
00:33:47 But that's fine.
00:33:48 The point is, regular content, not like this, uh, Radcom pre-stuff, Weagabwa, but that just
00:33:56 doesn't sound as good.
00:33:57 I'll, maybe I'll make like a meme at it where I just put like a B before the W or something.
00:34:01 I don't know.
00:34:02 Weagabwa.
00:34:03 Weagabwa.
00:34:04 Weagabwa.
00:34:05 All right.
00:34:06 Not bad.
00:34:07 Not bad.
00:34:08 You know, I have a criticism about the 10 paces and draw and I brought this up in the
00:34:12 chat, but I guess I'll bring it up on the show so people can hear it and weigh in on
00:34:15 it or whatever the fuck.
00:34:19 And I can, I can criticize it because I wasn't in the video, so it's worthless to me indeed.
00:34:24 And this is a direct result of how well it's edited.
00:34:28 Um, I noticed that when you have it, please don't say the music's too loud, please don't
00:34:33 say the music's too loud.
00:34:34 The music was a bit loud there, Ben.
00:34:35 Wait, was it actually though?
00:34:36 It was a little bit.
00:34:37 A little bit.
00:34:38 A little bit.
00:34:39 I tried to watch it on my phone, but I couldn't hear it.
00:34:40 I don't get it.
00:34:41 I don't fucking get it.
00:34:42 It does not sound too loud to me at all.
00:34:44 And some, what did you use to, Ben, what were you listening to when you listened to it
00:34:48 on headphones and on speakers, both?
00:34:50 You might have bad headphones.
00:34:51 Also, your, your judgment might have been off because you were like in it and you weren't
00:34:55 seeing it from the perspective of a, I mean, I tried turning the volume down and like,
00:34:59 I didn't want it to be too quiet because if it's too quiet, then it doesn't contribute
00:35:04 to the atmosphere.
00:35:05 Like the point of the music is to build atmosphere.
00:35:07 I know the struggle, Ben.
00:35:08 I know the struggle.
00:35:09 I understand.
00:35:10 But anyway, we interrupted Jesse, but yeah, please continue.
00:35:14 My actual criticism was is that because you have a show with the, the really good lighting,
00:35:21 the really good house set that we had, Victor's camera work, everything looks great and the
00:35:27 editing was so professional.
00:35:28 Oh, I think I know what you're going to say.
00:35:30 And it looked like a real show and because everything about it was so good and clean
00:35:34 and nice looking, it only makes it all the more jarring that half the cast is dressed
00:35:40 like complete slobs in bathrooms and pajamas.
00:35:43 I'm wearing pajama pants, Digi's in his like robe.
00:35:47 I mean, Nate looks fine.
00:35:48 Ben, did you see?
00:35:49 I think the pajamas.
00:35:50 The pajamas and bathrobe arc needs to end for the PCP.
00:35:53 Oh, I want to quickly say, I liked, I liked, I liked Hippo's sweater so much, I forgot
00:35:58 to comment, but I liked his sweater so much, he's such a cute sweater.
00:36:00 Hippo looked fine.
00:36:01 Well, okay.
00:36:02 Hippo looked fine.
00:36:03 Tom looked fine.
00:36:04 Nate looked okay.
00:36:05 Everyone else.
00:36:06 I was looking good.
00:36:07 I was, I was in my, Ben, were you?
00:36:08 Are you aware?
00:36:09 Come on.
00:36:10 Okay.
00:36:11 That's iconic.
00:36:12 Everyone loves that.
00:36:13 Are you aware of the emergence of the dye, like the diverged timeline character that
00:36:16 is the, the, the earth shattering meta rebalancing character that is fat Ben.
00:36:22 The people love fat Ben, they want fat Ben from sea to shining sea.
00:36:27 And frankly, we want this current Ben out the window, we want fat Ben back.
00:36:31 I fucking killed fat Ben.
00:36:33 I look so, I hate how I look in that video so bad.
00:36:36 I'm so fat.
00:36:37 My hair is like, my hair looks shit and only accentuates my giant forehead to an embarrassing
00:36:42 degree.
00:36:43 I've got like, I've got jowls.
00:36:44 I'm like, I'm not clean, I'm not clean shaven, but I don't have the beard.
00:36:48 So I just, my face just looks like, I look like pale and like jaundiced and just, just
00:36:53 scruffy, but not in a cool, scruffy way.
00:36:55 I don't remember why I clicked on it, but the other day I happened to be watching the,
00:37:01 the old, uh, TBAP Q and A video.
00:37:04 Oh, the, where were you?
00:37:05 That was great.
00:37:06 What a beautiful voice.
00:37:07 And I was just thinking, who is this beautiful man?
00:37:10 Yeah.
00:37:11 And where did his beard go?
00:37:14 When was he killed and replaced by the monster Ben saint?
00:37:17 TBAP, TBAP, TBAP Q and A Ben, he's coming back.
00:37:23 I'm actually better.
00:37:24 He's actually, he's coming back, but better cause now I look, I look handsome, but I also
00:37:28 look like a freak now.
00:37:29 Oh yeah.
00:37:30 I was going to ask about the haircut.
00:37:31 Yeah.
00:37:32 Yeah.
00:37:33 I was going to ask about the haircut.
00:37:34 It has the hair grown in a little bit.
00:37:36 It's, yeah.
00:37:37 I mean, it's still short on the side, but it's not like, you look older now.
00:37:42 You look older and less like an adult paradoxically now.
00:37:45 That's, you know.
00:37:46 Well, you mean in the, in the, in the 10 paces?
00:37:49 Uh, no, now.
00:37:51 Just in general.
00:37:52 Just in older and let, yeah.
00:37:53 Okay.
00:37:54 I'll take that.
00:37:55 I mean, that was funny.
00:37:56 Oh my God.
00:37:57 I take it back.
00:37:58 Your beard is so full and your hair is so kimp and you're wearing that plaid.
00:38:03 Isn't he a handsome boy though?
00:38:04 Yeah.
00:38:05 My beard is not back.
00:38:06 It's not as long as it was in that one, but it's, it's getting there.
00:38:09 I straight up think.
00:38:10 Ben and I will look back.
00:38:11 Uh, and I mean, you can right now, that Q and A video is what changed everything for
00:38:16 us.
00:38:17 If we had not made that one video, we probably never would have met like the rest of you
00:38:21 guys.
00:38:22 It changed everything.
00:38:23 It did.
00:38:24 It straight up changed everything.
00:38:25 And you know what it comes down to?
00:38:26 It's the fact that we were hot guys, work on your parents, it matters.
00:38:31 Being attractive goes so far in life.
00:38:33 Don't give up on yourself.
00:38:34 Look how far we've all fallen.
00:38:35 I know.
00:38:36 Look how I used to look.
00:38:37 I love myself.
00:38:38 I love myself too, but I'm back on track now.
00:38:40 I'm back right before I came on this podcast.
00:38:42 I was at, I've got a new gym membership, 10 minutes down the street from my current apartment.
00:38:47 I was there and because I worked out first thing in the morning, this is the secret
00:38:51 to life because I worked out before I did anything else.
00:38:54 I come home and I'm like, well, I'm not wasting this.
00:38:57 This day is going to be perfect.
00:38:58 So I get my fuel.
00:38:59 I get my protein powder.
00:39:00 I'm going to go have a fucking salad when we're done here.
00:39:02 Start your day off right people and you'll do no wrong.
00:39:05 Hey, I'm eating a salad right now.
00:39:06 You can probably hear me munching on this fucking rabbit food in an American phone.
00:39:10 Hell yeah.
00:39:11 I just, that's what I like to hear.
00:39:12 I feel good.
00:39:13 I feel good knowing.
00:39:14 I'm very confident in this that like you look at T-Bab Q&A Ben, you look at Radcon 3
00:39:19 Ben, basically a complete 180.
00:39:22 Fat Ben.
00:39:23 Please call him by his proper name.
00:39:24 Fat Ben.
00:39:25 Yeah.
00:39:26 Well, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm happy to say.
00:39:27 Old Fish Ben.
00:39:28 Present Ben.
00:39:29 Modern Day Ben.
00:39:30 Current Ben that sits before you right now is much closer to T-Bab Q&A Ben than to Fat
00:39:35 Ben.
00:39:36 That's pretty cool.
00:39:37 T-Bab Q&A aesthetic is what I want for 10 paces in draw and all future professional
00:39:42 production.
00:39:43 I actually, I actually fit into that shirt once more.
00:39:47 Finally.
00:39:48 Congratulations.
00:39:49 Thank you.
00:39:50 God yeah.
00:39:51 It is, it is so emotionally painful for me to watch videos of myself from like 2012
00:39:59 or like 2011 and just seeing like, like I watch videos of me from that time period and think
00:40:05 I have never seen a more handsome man in my fucking life.
00:40:09 Where did he go?
00:40:10 What happened?
00:40:11 That's how I felt.
00:40:12 That's how I felt looking at T-Bab Q&A Ben.
00:40:13 And I know what happened.
00:40:14 I met you guys.
00:40:15 The PCP was created.
00:40:17 This, this coalition came together and sucked the life out of every one of us individually
00:40:22 to add to the hideous collective like an Akira blob destroying all in its path growing more
00:40:28 and more grotesque by the minute.
00:40:31 Can I just make a quick point?
00:40:32 I've reversed the trend.
00:40:33 Ben's.
00:40:34 Ben's.
00:40:36 I just want to point out the shirt that I'm wearing into T-Bab Q&A is the same shirt that
00:40:41 I'm wearing in 10 paces in draw though like gray and black striped horizontal stripes.
00:40:47 It's the same shirt.
00:40:48 Glowing, aren't you?
00:40:49 I'm, I'm a perfect man.
00:40:51 That's my point.
00:40:52 That's what I'm trying to say.
00:40:54 Oh, speaking, speaking of you, in my enemy group, we watched Zambieland Saga.
00:41:00 We finished Zambieland Saga and we, we, we, we, we dubbed, yeah, we, we dubbed that guy
00:41:04 Anonite because it's literally just you.
00:41:07 You should watch it.
00:41:08 Haven't watched it?
00:41:09 You should watch it.
00:41:10 I, I, I certainly intend to.
00:41:11 I certainly intend to.
00:41:12 I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
00:41:13 We love that guy.
00:41:14 He's a good guy.
00:41:15 He's better than you.
00:41:16 But it is you.
00:41:18 So it's like.
00:41:19 Doubtful.
00:41:20 Oh, is he the guy in like the suit?
00:41:22 Yeah, he wears like the glasses and shit.
00:41:24 I mean, I haven't seen Zambieland Saga, but I think I've seen the character posted with
00:41:29 Nate comparisons.
00:41:30 Yes.
00:41:31 Um, yeah.
00:41:32 Um, I wish I watched television shows.
00:41:36 I only watch YouTube videos now.
00:41:37 I've been thinking.
00:41:38 Oh, you're missing out.
00:41:39 TV rules.
00:41:40 I've been thinking about this.
00:41:41 I've been thinking about that.
00:41:43 And yeah, for, sometimes I think, man, I don't watch Netflix.
00:41:47 I don't watch Marvel movies.
00:41:48 I don't watch Disney movies.
00:41:49 I don't, I'm like, I'm like a, I like, I like, don't participate in the culture and
00:41:54 it's hamstringing my social life.
00:41:56 But then I was like, wait, maybe I should just lean into it and be like, I don't watch
00:42:00 Disney shit because corporations control our lives and I won't fucking be subject to
00:42:05 their, to their whims.
00:42:06 I won't fucking let them.
00:42:07 I want to think that hard about the Shiki Watch though.
00:42:10 But well, I mean, it's okay because I'm not naturally inclined to watch any of these things.
00:42:14 So maybe I should just lean into, maybe I should just lean into that tendency.
00:42:18 Disney's going to own every entertainment property before too long because that's straight
00:42:22 up the way they're going.
00:42:23 There's just absorbing everything.
00:42:24 Yeah.
00:42:25 I mean, there's a, there's a couple others that they get their, that they get their
00:42:29 mitts on will be the procrastinators and the whole thing that they'll never get their
00:42:33 hands on.
00:42:34 We will stand against the, we will be David fighting against that Goliath.
00:42:39 And in that day, our one ally will be the one podcast that cannot be found, the pizza
00:42:44 party podcast.
00:42:45 And if we will be able to fall, we'll be unwilling allies.
00:42:49 Where's the podcast?
00:42:50 Cause we need to team up.
00:42:51 We need to find them and team up against Disney.
00:42:53 Exactly.
00:42:54 We need, we need allies.
00:42:55 Ben, I want to team up this weird meme is going to end with Ben loving the pizza party
00:43:02 podcast.
00:43:03 If only I could find them, maybe I would love them.
00:43:09 Who knows.
00:43:10 I was saying that I want to watch more like topical shows and get on that rich deep fandom.
00:43:16 I just meant that, uh, anime is, you know, honestly through through my travels with Chibi
00:43:22 Baka's, you know, they're actually, it's, it means kind of good, you know, you're a
00:43:26 guy, you're a guy that I think I'm in the generally the same category of maybe a little
00:43:30 bit less these days, but like, uh, there's like most anime is trash.
00:43:34 So just watch the good ones and people will tell you what the good ones are.
00:43:38 And that's what Chibi Baka should be in, you know, I mean, that's what I've been doing
00:43:41 for years.
00:43:42 Classics.
00:43:43 Yeah.
00:43:44 I've never seen cowboy bbop.
00:43:45 I've never seen.
00:43:46 It's worth it.
00:43:47 Efficio.
00:43:48 Or it's sequel cowboy rock study.
00:43:50 Yeah.
00:43:52 Woo.
00:43:53 That's for the, that's for the, that's for the millennial.
00:43:56 Oh, no, no.
00:43:57 I mean, Nate's not millennial.
00:43:59 He doesn't seem Doug.
00:44:00 He doesn't know about Bluffington.
00:44:01 I know Doug and I know Bluffington.
00:44:03 No.
00:44:04 Well, obviously not.
00:44:05 Cause you're about Don Tello.
00:44:09 Don Tello.
00:44:10 Look, I'm crazy for this fucking pizza.
00:44:12 Hey, hey, let me just take a moment to wish everybody a happy St. Patrick's Day.
00:44:17 Happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody.
00:44:19 Today's St. Patrick's Day.
00:44:20 Today, the day of recording is St. Patrick's Day.
00:44:22 Oh yeah.
00:44:23 For us, for people, it's been like a week now.
00:44:26 Does England care about St. Patrick at all?
00:44:29 Or is he an Irish rebel?
00:44:31 It's a bad man.
00:44:32 I don't know.
00:44:33 I stay at home every day.
00:44:34 They do.
00:44:35 What do I must say?
00:44:36 Well, hey, let me tell you a story.
00:44:37 I was in, I was in Ireland for St. Patrick's Day.
00:44:40 Oh shit.
00:44:41 God, maybe like.
00:44:42 Don't they turn the rivers green?
00:44:43 Oh wait, that's Boston.
00:44:44 Like six years ago or something?
00:44:45 I don't know.
00:44:46 It was however many years ago I was over there.
00:44:48 You know, it's different.
00:44:49 The funny thing about St. Patrick's Day in Ireland is it's a much more, it's more, well,
00:44:54 it's kind of split in two.
00:44:55 The natives.
00:44:56 It's spiritual or something.
00:44:57 It's more laid back and it's more of like a religious holiday.
00:45:00 I mean, it's not like super, but somewhat.
00:45:02 And like the natives, you know, they'll go out to a bar, they'll be with their friends
00:45:06 and family.
00:45:07 The tourists, the tourists in fucking Dublin in like the tourist section of, did you know
00:45:13 that like the like quote unquote like historical district of Dublin is like a construction.
00:45:19 Like it was built like relatively recently, but built in like an old timey looking cobblestone
00:45:25 way to like look like what people imagine when they think of like jolly old Dublin or whatever.
00:45:31 I was unaware of that.
00:45:32 It's like a tourist construction.
00:45:35 Ireland is like, it's driven by the tourism industry.
00:45:39 They got like fucking tour buses running around.
00:45:41 They got with leprechauns on the side.
00:45:43 Everything's owned by Guinness confirms in the chat that St. Patrick's Day is a quirky
00:45:49 thing in England.
00:45:50 But everyone likes bear.
00:45:51 Okay.
00:45:52 So there you go.
00:45:53 It's the English perspective.
00:45:54 Yeah.
00:45:55 It's it's it's not like in America.
00:45:56 I think it's bigger in America.
00:45:57 Isn't it?
00:45:58 People go nuts.
00:45:59 Well, I mean, it's more of like, I mean, it's like a party holiday for adults.
00:46:02 It's like a party holiday in America.
00:46:04 Yeah.
00:46:05 See, I don't, I don't drink alcohol.
00:46:06 So it's not a, it's not a big deal for me.
00:46:09 Yeah.
00:46:10 That's, that's, that's, that's how we do it.
00:46:12 I do like a raucous atmosphere, though.
00:46:14 I like people having a good time.
00:46:16 I do too.
00:46:17 I feel like a raucous caucus.
00:46:19 Yeah.
00:46:20 That's why we're going to the Capitol, baby.
00:46:22 Gonna shoot up the Senate.
00:46:23 Wait.
00:46:24 Whoa.
00:46:25 That's not what I meant to say.
00:46:26 Head on over to the PCP store.
00:46:28 Buy your I'm the reason people are dying shirt.
00:46:31 Link links below.
00:46:32 No math shootings.
00:46:33 That's not what I actually meant to say.
00:46:34 I meant to say, well, I go have fun with the Senate.
00:46:37 I love my elected representatives.
00:46:39 No one's going to believe that you were trying to say,
00:46:42 let's have fun with the Senate.
00:46:43 But you said, let's shoot up the Capitol.
00:46:45 Those are not the same thing.
00:46:47 People are on edge these days.
00:46:48 It's like one letters difference.
00:46:50 Take Donald Trump on a night out.
00:46:52 I'd, I'd chill with Donald Trump.
00:46:54 I'd get blasted on ghetto blasters with the DT boy.
00:46:57 This is a perfect segue.
00:46:59 Because.
00:47:00 Yeah.
00:47:01 Yeah.
00:47:02 And then I'll segue.
00:47:03 Okay.
00:47:04 Okay.
00:47:05 Just real quick.
00:47:06 Cause I don't want to ruin your segue.
00:47:07 Just ruin my fucking segue.
00:47:08 I'll stop between two worlds, a world of darkness and light.
00:47:10 And I'm calm between my ethnic father and my peer,
00:47:15 Boston Irish mother.
00:47:19 So whenever she, if I'm around,
00:47:22 she flips on the Irish accent and incredibly raciously and pretends
00:47:26 that we are Irish even though,
00:47:28 is that true?
00:47:30 Yeah.
00:47:31 Yeah.
00:47:32 Okay, listen, we are Irish,
00:47:34 but that does not matter.
00:47:35 And Irish people aren't distinct or like,
00:47:37 Or like different in real life. So like like guys, we're so fucking Irish. Let's go to the pub
00:47:44 Let's go in Irish. Let's get some corned beef and cabbage. That's that's the American way to do it
00:47:51 I don't know if Irish people aren't distinctive enough
00:47:54 Maybe you're just not Irish. I mean cuz my family is pretty stereotypically Irish in every conceivable way
00:48:01 Well, what do you got you got drunkenness?
00:48:03 You got I don't know. I have blue collar. I don't know. I have ten aunts and uncles. They're all alcoholics
00:48:10 They're all rage-fueled maniacs. Most of them are deeply religious so far so good in in in Ireland. I I
00:48:17 Was at a pub. I was in an Irish pub and I talked to a girl
00:48:21 and
00:48:24 She was a native and I remember asking her if she spoke Irish and she said no and she seemed annoyed
00:48:30 I think she seemed annoyed by the question like maybe there's Irish isn't a fucking language
00:48:34 It is a fucking language. Yeah, then there's the Celtic that there's Celtic
00:48:38 I think you're supposed to call it Irish called Gaelic
00:48:41 But it's there's that'd be fucking gay though
00:48:47 When I was there people told me don't call it, you know Celtic or Gaelic just call it Irish
00:48:52 Yeah, and I so I was like, okay
00:48:53 And I asked someone if they spoke Irish and she said no and I think she was annoyed
00:48:56 I didn't mean to imply this but I think maybe she thought that it was like sort of derogatory to even ask the question because the answer
00:49:04 Is no because it was like implicitly saying like oh, you're not real Irish
00:49:07 I wasn't trying to imply that at all, but I think she was annoyed by it anyway
00:49:11 Fair enough. It might also be because she gets asked the question a lot, and it's just annoying after a while
00:49:17 Maybe yeah, maybe probably or it could be that right after that you asked her where she keeps her lucky charms
00:49:23 I'm always after those lucky charms
00:49:32 So I'm entitled to a quarter of the pot the Welsh and the Irish make you so fucking upset trying to pretend like England like
00:49:40 Isn't there like their hegemon and trying to pretend like they're their own distinct countries?
00:49:45 I know I know listen the troubles are coming back, and I'm clearly on the fucking Union inside right fucking
00:49:55 Okay, so here's so I'm imagining that like in England
00:49:58 You probably you got you got Wales you got Scotland you got I don't know fucking Denmark or whatever the fuck else they got
00:50:05 And and like every single one of those is their Texas like always like griping and
00:50:12 They're gonna see one of these days. Oh my god. That's okay. I really like England for England. Just has like four Texas's
00:50:22 Ireland has enough to that I get it that they you know don't want to be in the best you know empire in the world for some reason
00:50:29 Wait, wait, but Ireland actually is Ireland is its own country. No, yeah, I know Northern Ireland is part of the UK
00:50:35 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right anyway, but the Welsh have no excuse and it makes me so fucking mad
00:50:42 And pretend like they're different they try they are different goddamn, but they've got a dude
00:50:47 They've got a Welsh accent. It's totally unique and different and I don't know
00:50:52 They were literally part of England for like like like like hundreds of years
00:50:56 They were literally okay
00:50:57 Listen to this though the best thing that ever happened for the Welsh identity was in Xenoblade Chronicles 2
00:51:03 many of the characters have Welsh accents specifically and
00:51:07 Minj posting minj posting will save the Welsh identity and what Minj posting is
00:51:12 There is a character named Nia in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 who is a cat girl with a Welsh accent as many of the characters do but especially her and
00:51:20 In one of her costumes. She has okay
00:51:24 Stick with me here
00:51:25 She's wearing a pretty revealing outfit. Does she have the dragon? Does she have the Welsh dragon on our no what she has?
00:51:31 What she has is a it's a patch of like it's like mesh or something
00:51:36 Directly above her crotch where you can like you can see her belly button
00:51:40 So you know it's flesh and you can see her skin and you can see the like lack of pubic hair
00:51:45 And this is what's known as minj posting to draw attention to the fact that you can see so closely
00:51:51 To where her pubic hair would be visible and you can almost get a glimpse of that minj
00:51:55 So I'm just saying this horrible work has saved the Welsh identity for generations to come
00:52:04 I need to clarify something I need to clarify something
00:52:07 This is not me saying that all like European or like English-speaking Europeans are the same
00:52:12 I'm just saying that England is the best one. So you should try and gravitate towards it culturally
00:52:20 Okay, listen, all right, okay
00:52:22 I take back what I originally I take back what I originally said the troubles not coming back, you know, Ireland sure
00:52:26 I just hate the Welsh is what I'm trying to say
00:52:31 Cuz they fucking don't cuz they fucking don't not trying to say anything controversial here. I just fuck fuck those guys
00:52:37 Can we get some Welsh voice mails, please? I want to hear the where Welsh defend their I don't know ethnic or cultural
00:52:44 Identity they have language well Welsh like is a language and it's fucking
00:52:52 It's literally stupid
00:53:13 This I mean I mean last episode we had maids tell those hateful bigoted jokes and this
00:53:22 Luckily at the same time a Jesse clarified that racism is in fact over so there's no need to worry about it anymore
00:53:32 The list of countries and people who I hate unequivocally and you can't become cool if you're from them
00:53:37 If you're if you're Welsh or if you're Spanish, I will fucking obliterate you your countries are shit
00:53:43 And I hate them Mexico cool Spain toilet. Yeah
00:53:47 That's yeah
00:53:50 But what about what about Catalonia, what about Barcelona that place is cool
00:54:02 I want to mix in with the local color the ruffians and the rowdies, you know, it's it's rowdy central in Barcelona
00:54:08 That's not true
00:54:13 By the way
00:54:15 Yeah, okay, go on I'm saying is that your Welsh go back to Argentina
00:54:20 Fair and as always munchy so
00:54:24 Okay, back to my perfect segue an hour ago. Wait. Let me first before you say it
00:54:28 Yeah, we've got new t-shirts people buy the group piss t-shirt because it's dope is I made I made the group this t-shirt because I need more
00:54:37 This was a you know, I mean I made I made the group piss image for a banner and I thought I'd make a pretty dope shirt
00:54:43 And I was right. He was so right. We all love it. I want one
00:54:47 I might get one. I know what people should do
00:54:49 I have a p.o. Box open people buy me the group piss shirt and send it to my p.o. Box
00:54:55 I'd really appreciate what size shirt you wear medium medium. Yeah, yeah
00:55:01 There you go. I actually made a shirt
00:55:02 I made a shirt. I'm not selling it because I would have felt weird selling it
00:55:05 But I made a shirt to celebrate my new meme
00:55:08 And my new meme is yang gang. I am yang gang now
00:55:14 Yeah, no, I own it listen that invented
00:55:18 Yang is stealing other people's jokes and memes for his t-shirt scam. Yeah
00:55:25 Yang yang is my new keto is what I'm saying
00:55:29 This is my new thing that I will talk interminably about and ruin everyone's good time
00:55:33 Okay, I'm about to start a fucking wildfire right now because I'm literally gonna ask this question
00:55:37 I mean like I literally don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah is Andrew. Yeah
00:55:42 You don't even want to know
00:55:44 I was I was waiting for I've been waiting for this
00:55:47 Can I just say can I just say I knew you were gonna bring this up and in preparation
00:55:51 I went and listened excuse me to large segments of the Joe Rogan podcast with Andrew Yang
00:55:56 In preparation to discuss this topic. Okay. Okay. I I listen to that. I listen to that podcast
00:56:02 I listen to I spent literally hours. I spent out. I was like all night. I had like yang shit on in the
00:56:08 I had yang shit playing in the back. I listen intently. I'm a yang scholar now
00:56:13 Okay, Benza yang man. Benza
00:56:15 I am a yang man hashtag. Yeah, I'm I'm with I mean I'm a yang man in the yang gang. Okay, please start like that
00:56:23 I don't know anything about I could not I could could not possibly have wished for for more
00:56:31 Well, he's a he's an entrepreneur
00:56:34 He he worked with the Obama
00:56:37 He was recognized, okay, he was recognized by the Obama administration
00:56:40 He wasn't like a cabinet member, but he was like involved with with the the
00:56:45 Advisor, I think yeah, he was he was named like a an ambassador like a technology or an entrepreneurial ambassador or something like that
00:56:55 So well his yeah, well his thing is automation his he like he's he's with like Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and
00:57:03 Other technocrats and saying that like automation is like it's you know, it's replacing the need for work
00:57:08 It's replacing the need for workers. It's taking jobs
00:57:11 And the solution to it the solution to automation taking jobs is
00:57:16 What he calls the freedom dividend or a universal basic income for American citizens
00:57:21 So this is the meme everyone ever if he's president every American regardless of how rich or poor you are will get a thousand dollars
00:57:29 Every month and the way that it's paid for is with it with something called a value-added tax
00:57:35 Which like most country including all of the EU already have a value-added tax and we don't
00:57:40 And by their cucks and by and by the way
00:57:44 Amazon paid zero dollars in taxes last year Amazon made 11 billion dollars and paid nothing in taxes
00:57:50 But do you know why that is because they're criminals?
00:57:54 What incorrect then because yeah, yeah, I know it's legal
00:57:56 I know it's legal, but that means but that means that the law but I know it's legal, but that means the laws are broken
00:58:03 But if you if you start if you start a political debate, I'll start talking about dreams and I ain't gonna stop
00:58:12 Hey, I solved politics on the last episode
00:58:17 I just I just want to get to the end I want to get to the end of it
00:58:20 So the idea is that like automation and stuff takes you know, it's taking a lot of jobs
00:58:25 It's generating huge amount of wealth for people like
00:58:28 Bezos for example, so those corporations that are benefiting from
00:58:32 Automation they'll pay a value-added tax less than what Europe charges for a similar thing like half of what Europe already imposes
00:58:38 But that will pay for this freedom dividend
00:58:40 So as these like, you know technocrats and tech companies are making huge amounts of money
00:58:44 They'll be taxed on their profits derived largely from automation and it'll be shared with you know
00:58:49 The American people including workers that are displaced by said animation and the idea is that automation should like make life better
00:58:57 For everyone so like as automation is is implemented, you know
00:59:01 The need for work decreases because robots are fucking taking on the workload
00:59:05 So everyone, you know shares in the benefits that automation brings to our lives and so
00:59:11 One second one second. So wait
00:59:14 What the only proposed way to
00:59:18 Pay for this universal basic income is to add more taxes and not to remove anything else. It's about well
00:59:25 I don't recommend it's not replacing any like current social welfare systems
00:59:29 But like people shut up
00:59:30 But like people that are already getting like welfare and stuff like they won't they won't get a thousand dollars on top of what they're
00:59:36 Already getting it'll be like you can get the thousand dollars or you can get what you're currently getting from welfare system
00:59:42 So just that that's true Ben
00:59:44 But I because I just listened to it as well. It is actually it's true that he he doesn't think this should
00:59:48 I don't believe he thinks that just that is enough to cover the entire okay, so he said right so right now
00:59:54 There's three hundred million so that makes the basically if you just round off the extra people or whatever the UBI total payment per year
01:00:01 Would be three trillion dollars, but not really
01:00:05 That was it's actually more like so much money. It's 1.8 trillion would be the cost
01:00:09 Oh, I remember him saying 1.5. So so fair enough and that's because munchie. What he was saying was that like
01:00:15 Every every the we currently pay about 1.5 trillion is what I heard
01:00:21 Maybe it's less or whatever in current like subsidies for like welfare and I don't know like food stamps like that that kind of stuff
01:00:27 Yeah, so that the unemployment all that stuff. So so that's fair
01:00:30 And so it's all about you got to make up that oh right and so as Ben was saying if you currently get benefits that are that exceed or
01:00:38 Equal the thousand dollars if this is implemented and you just keep those you're currently if you're currently getting 500 a month from benefits
01:00:45 Then you can get an extra 500 to make up the different like like the floor is a thousand
01:00:52 And you you can get more if you're currently getting more then they'll just leave it at that is what he said
01:00:55 So the idea is not it's yeah
01:00:58 It's it's not as expensive as it seems on the face
01:01:00 But because not because lots of people are already getting benefits
01:01:03 So like the the actual cost for it will be about the I heard him quote like it's somewhere between
01:01:09 Sometimes he said like less than two sometimes it's one and one and a half
01:01:13 I think it's somewhere around 1.8 trillion to be the total cost current American like the the spending of America per year is like
01:01:19 20 trillion so this is not like
01:01:22 Outlandish increase, but like the difference is gonna get made up in this value added tax is the now
01:01:27 Let me say this Ben
01:01:28 Because I think you'll find me more warm to this idea than that then people might have expected
01:01:33 Yeah, cuz UBI has a lot of benefits and when I really think about
01:01:37 Okay, okay, so like automation is coming and the the predictors that like many many people are doing because Yang seems to be correct about this
01:01:45 That's in I believe they said by 2030
01:01:48 This number varies a lot, but the kind of jobs that like 50% of Americans do will be gone
01:01:55 Yeah, by 2030 like like I mean he has like a list that he goes through. It's like truckers
01:02:02 food service workers
01:02:04 Retail workers like just just for the sake of people call center worker call center workers
01:02:08 Yeah, like these like 15% of jobs in America are automatable and they might just go away anytime for people to
01:02:14 latch on to in 29 states in America being a trucker is the most common job and those when we
01:02:22 Automated I know it's shocking isn't that insane, but by the time
01:02:26 And when those all get automated automated away those people will be out of luck and they'll be out of jobs and people
01:02:33 Like to lean into the whole retraining thing. Yeah, that is that is a very low success rate
01:02:39 It has been it's a low success rate and people say learn to code like all these truckers are gonna get they're just gonna
01:02:44 You know become software programmers like only only 8% of job
01:02:49 I'm just quoting a lot of shit that he says in interviews
01:02:52 He repeats a lot of these talking points a lot as any politician has to it's like
01:02:56 8% of the jobs in America are like in STEM fields and like so you can't you can't re-educate
01:03:03 92% of
01:03:04 Americans to do what 8% of Americans are currently have it's like it just does and where were those jobs even come from
01:03:11 You don't really got to learn to code you can just write it in the back of your hand up up down down left right left
01:03:22 Yang will give every American 30 extra lives
01:03:26 I'll find this meme and I'll post it
01:03:28 But there's a good meme of the guy with his girl looking over his shoulder at another girl
01:03:34 And it's he's with his girl that's Donald Trump face and it says America going to shit looking over a shoulder at hot girl
01:03:40 With Yang's face that says America going to shit. I'm conflicted plus one thousand dollars these memes now
01:03:46 Comparing Yang with Trump. He's really no similarity or almost actually so there's a couple with like their arbitrary like yeah
01:03:53 They're both entrepreneurs. I guess okay
01:03:55 Well, the reason why this is here is the like how I first heard about Yang
01:03:59 Yeah, okay first time on Joe Rogan
01:04:00 but the Yang meme has been popularized by people on the far right who believed in Donald Trump and
01:04:07 Currently think that the world is going to shit. Maybe not even a far right. I don't whatever people can speak for themselves
01:04:12 it seems to be a right-wing thing though and
01:04:13 They think that the world is going to shit Trump has not solved the issue that they hoped would solve and so imagine that and
01:04:21 So so they say Yang obviously he's the opposite of Trump in a lot of ways
01:04:25 So they it's accelerationism. They want to vote for Yang
01:04:28 I just fuck up America so we can just get this whole like that makes me so
01:04:34 Mad by the way that that acceleration is so funny Ben. It's so funny laugh every time accelerationists are I
01:04:42 There's I mean, they're the ultimate black pill. It's so fucking. It's such like fucking high school nihilism bullshit
01:04:49 I mean, we don't need to get into this too much
01:04:50 But that black like accelerationism was absolutely the motivation of the New Zealand shooter guy. It's that kind of thought process
01:04:58 That's why it makes me fucking mad
01:05:01 Sorry, so accelerationists. Yeah
01:05:04 It's the idea that like the world is fucked so we need to fuck it more
01:05:08 We need to fuck it as much as possible and faster to lead to like the cataclysm that will like just lead to be rebuilding
01:05:15 Everything from the ground up. Yeah. Yeah, and so people like the people who are on the on the right or whatever
01:05:20 They think that the world is drifting hopelessly into like a spiral of leftism whether you believe they're not whatever like
01:05:25 Let's just make that happen really fast because they believe the world will collapse under that and then they can rebuild
01:05:29 You know, maybe some right-wing conservative or objectivist utopia. Whatever. I want to say one more thing about the UBI Alaska already does it
01:05:36 Did you hear that?
01:05:37 Yeah, because they've got those oil riches
01:05:40 But you know what citizens in Alaska already get free money, okay
01:05:43 Here's the government for the the oil that they're coming so like the idea. It's like we are we're already doing it to a second
01:05:50 I haven't a collusion about this. Okay, and here's what it is. Look. I still unironically think taxationist theft
01:05:55 I just we should do it anyway. We should do it anyway
01:06:00 All right, and I guess I agree. I'm on your side. Okay. Here's that well
01:06:05 Here's the thing. I'm on your side when it comes to this automation issue
01:06:08 I see no alternative, but to basically do what Yang's proposing. Yeah, but the caveats I have are I
01:06:14 Don't think we should okay
01:06:16 I need I need real facts and logic to show me that like the rates that we're talking about now like
01:06:23 To have it in 2030 when we're in that world that makes a lot of sense to do it at that
01:06:27 But we don't but it's already happening like people we should ease into it just as it's people are already
01:06:33 I mean we might we might do more we'll probably have to do more in the future
01:06:37 But like it's already happening. So why do we not all right? We should all right? We should start correcting for it now
01:06:42 Okay
01:06:43 Well, that's if we do it too late then like that's terrible. I'm with you
01:06:47 I'm with you
01:06:48 We should probably lean a little bit more into doing it than to not and just like let the people suffer because I think that could
01:06:54 Cause serious fucking collapse of so this guy's like 50% of America had no job
01:06:58 We so this guy is like the opposite of Trump is what you're saying. Yeah
01:07:03 So in a sense this is made you in a sense Donald Trump is the yin to his yang
01:07:12 Damn damn. That's good. Um, have you seen the meme? This is my I like
01:07:18 Have mixed feelings about the Trump comparisons
01:07:20 But there's a mean of like it's four panels and it's a guy in a met
01:07:24 It's the what's that like sad face guy, you know the one that I know
01:07:28 Yeah, it's feel it's feel guy
01:07:29 But like yeah, he's red and his eyes are bulging and he's crying angry tears
01:07:33 Yes, and he's got the MAGA hat on and in four panels
01:07:36 He just fades into his MAGA hat fades into the yang gang 2020 hat and he just just smiling gently
01:07:42 And then in the last panel, it's a little thousand dollar bill. It's like, yeah
01:07:47 That one makes me that one cracks me the fuck up. By the way, so I mean I made a shirt
01:07:50 I made it. I made a shirt
01:07:52 It's not I'm not selling it because I feel like that would be weird because it didn't make the design
01:07:55 But I took the I took the vaporwave aesthetic yang symbol and I put it on a purple t-shirt
01:08:01 And I just bought one for myself and I'm gonna wear that thing
01:08:04 Everywhere, that's cool. Okay. Here's the thing though. I have one commentary on this. Okay, so
01:08:10 the basically so yang's proposal is for like
01:08:14 Deplaced workers who will be excuse me out of a job due to automation or whatnot. Okay. Here's my thought on this Ben
01:08:20 I think it's fair to say you have a relatively
01:08:23 Parasitic attitude toward life. I think that's fair to say. I don't think that's fair to say you Ben you Ben are able body
01:08:30 I'm sure Ben would call it educated college graduates with no excuse to not get a job that puts you above
01:08:38 What these 50% of people who will be deplaced get there is no excuse
01:08:43 You know what for you to not do that. I'll answer this. I'll answer this. Okay. I mean, I've had
01:08:48 I've had quote-unquote real jobs in the past and
01:08:53 I just admit you want the thousand bucks Ben. Just tell me you want me nice. I mean, I won't lie
01:08:58 I do want it, but I was think I was I was literally I was anticipating this criticism
01:09:02 And I was thinking about it as I was taking a piss before the show and I thought about it
01:09:06 I decided that I can honestly say that I think I would support yang even if for whatever reason it was like everyone
01:09:12 But you gets it like I would still think it's a good thing like I still think it makes sense
01:09:17 I do want the thousand dollars. I won't lie. Of course. I
01:09:21 Mean I I mean I've worked real jobs before and you know, I hated them
01:09:26 I always felt like I was just wait it was just a waste of time for the most part like I was spent
01:09:33 I was spending like most of my time right going to this job at this job
01:09:38 I didn't even work anywhere close to the nine-to-five the nine-to-five is like a fake made-up arbitrary number that like some
01:09:47 Inherited boomer mentality says that we should all do regardless of whether or not it makes any sense
01:09:53 Nobody works eight hours a day at their nine-to-five. It doesn't happen. Everyone is like I mean
01:09:58 It's think about Dilbert everyone everyone relates to Dilbert Dilbert's all about people pretending to work people you go to your job
01:10:04 And you pretend to work for most of your nine-to-five. That's like that's like the experience
01:10:08 That's what that's so common. Well, I'm surprised you're supporting communism after saying all that. I'm it's not communism
01:10:15 By the way, yeah, this is I mean this is this is capitalism with a floor
01:10:19 Is no, no, no, I just didn't regard to see your previous statements in the previous part
01:10:25 That was sort of a meme. It's not literally communism
01:10:29 But well, but Ben I have a nine-to-five and while it's true. I don't necessarily okay. This is the
01:10:36 We approach this definitely from two perspectives. I lead basically my whole existence. I prioritize
01:10:42 it's my job to get myself through life and I don't even want to depend on anyone else now with the automation shit
01:10:50 I get that I'm not in that position right now. So like I haven't been replaced by a robot and
01:10:55 And I mean, okay, this this isn't even an argument
01:10:58 But it's like let's just say this happens this automation stuff happens and you know 50% of
01:11:04 All Americans and I suppose it'll probably mostly men, but I don't know whatever will be replaced with
01:11:10 Robots and they just will give them the freedom to end or whatever and they can do that. I worry massively
01:11:17 First of all that I think a lot of people derive much of their like life purpose and happiness
01:11:23 Yeah from their gainful employment and like their sense of like feeding their family and you know being in charge of their life
01:11:30 And you know it might be inevitable
01:11:32 But I have deep worries that just like they're being no place for people
01:11:36 Society's just gonna be like fuck. Well, I mean get depressed and do drugs and sure, but that's I mean
01:11:42 I mean are you criticizing Yang? No, that's not doing this Yang's not replacing the jobs with robots
01:11:48 He's he's I'm away. This is not a criticism of Yang stuff at all. I just it's just a general fear about automation
01:11:54 Okay, yeah, I agree
01:11:56 I mean, you know like a trucker probably derives a lot of his self identity and his pride in himself from his you know
01:12:02 His ability to provide for his family and from his sense of you know
01:12:06 Accomplishment and like this is this is what he does and that's who he is
01:12:10 But you know automation can make that job obsolete and I don't think it's right
01:12:16 I don't think it makes sense to be like well, we should protect that because that's to be in like anti-progress
01:12:22 I'm not in favor of anti-progress at all. I hate that shit. Yeah, like like I heard Tucker Colerson arguing against like
01:12:28 Like advancing automation to protect jobs. Yeah, I can't imagine anything
01:12:32 That's horrible. Let's talk. Yeah, let's not protect. No, although although if like let's just say theoretically what I'm talking about here
01:12:40 Is true then like we might literally doom the human race by just continuing the advancement of technology
01:12:46 It's not gonna do just take it to its logical conclusion where we're all like Wally
01:12:51 Literal it like technology just takes care of itself and we are just okay
01:12:54 You know, I mean obviously everyone's fat and gross and Wally so you don't want to be like that
01:12:58 But like of course the purpose like like automation replacing the need for workers. That should be a good thing
01:13:04 Right. We that should that should make us happy because suddenly I want star trek. He's hard. Yeah. Yeah, exactly
01:13:10 We were these hard and difficult things that are like dangerous and time-consuming and boring and like
01:13:15 Just labor they're just labor for humans and this and we can we can make those things obsolete
01:13:21 We can liberate people to like have control of their lives and do what they want to do and not be slaves to an economic system
01:13:27 That demands that they I don't know mine for shit in fucking dangerous conditions. I hear you Ben. Yeah, I hear you
01:13:33 It's just I'm just saying it's possible that humanity is not properly equipped to handle that lifestyle and that it will all just fall apart
01:13:43 That you might you I mean you're not necessarily wrong, but it's coming no matter what I agree
01:13:47 Yeah, I mean it depends on how fast it goes humanity might
01:13:51 Manage to adapt and you know what let me just say like when it comes
01:13:55 I mean you're right mage humanity might manage to adapt like they did in Star Trek
01:13:57 But frankly in Star Trek even like that show was originally made in the 60s and shit
01:14:01 They didn't even know the technology that we have right now. That's radically changed how humanity interacts and stuff
01:14:08 So frankly, we can't even use that as a great predictor to begin with
01:14:12 But like but I mean the idea behind
01:14:15 Star Trek we're like, you know, technology is sufficiently advanced scarcity is gone
01:14:20 Everyone is provided for you know easily. It's not even a challenge and like just true those concerns
01:14:26 Are just gone. We don't have to worry about providing for ourselves. We can we can worry about like, you know, real shit
01:14:33 I do like the idea of not having to worry about your own self-worth in towards society like
01:14:40 It's pretty good right if everyone else is like, you know, like you and you know, you're just sit there and get a thousand bucks
01:14:47 And it's like
01:14:48 It'll it'll definitely reduce the stress caused by like oh am I am I of worth to society?
01:14:53 Am I am I being a letdown? Am I useless? Well, you know, you guys can I mean you probably have some insight on this all of us here
01:14:59 Because you know for the most part we're all off the grid workers at least in one of our jobs
01:15:04 Or you know as like a youtuber online person or whatever
01:15:07 It's like, you know, don't isn't it? Don't you think sometimes it would be easy to just like kind of lean back and like let's say that
01:15:13 You know, you just get money and you know, you could be working on your next YouTube video
01:15:17 You could be working on your comic you could be working on your commission
01:15:20 But like, you know now you don't need to well
01:15:22 I mean you're gonna be fine for me
01:15:24 And so you maybe you can just lean back and not go to the gym today and you can just like watch that new you know
01:15:28 VR sex doll simulation thing that just got downloaded to the main frame and you know fucking
01:15:37 Sorry go on yeah, I can tell you for a fact that for me personally just me just speaking about myself
01:15:43 Things would not change at all
01:15:46 Yeah, yeah, yeah same the reason say that now, but
01:15:52 Wait, well mage talk and then I'll go after yeah
01:15:55 I am I am
01:15:57 fortunate enough to be living with my boyfriend and he takes care of the bills and what I'm doing is mostly as a hobby and I'm
01:16:04 Earning for my own expenses like you know, if I want to buy some shit for myself
01:16:08 I you know, I have to earn it so if I got a thousand bucks, you know
01:16:12 He doesn't gonna change except I'll be able to buy more shit
01:16:15 I guess okay, but now but now let's say he also gets the thousand bucks and I mean, okay the thing about a thousand bucks
01:16:21 It's not enough to like live baby. It's enough to live. It's enough to like survive
01:16:27 So I imagine a lot of people will try to do things beyond that to like, you know, keep
01:16:32 I want to I want to say that like data has been collected and tests have been done and it seems like
01:16:39 The results of tests with programs like this is not that work like work does not decrease
01:16:44 I think people would in general like to look at it as to work and give it their all
01:16:49 To make money
01:16:51 Almost for a complete 100% fact that things with him would probably not change either
01:16:56 I think people people are we all want to think that though
01:17:00 We all want to think listen. I don't want to get into details because his life is his own. I don't really sure you know
01:17:06 Like knowing him things would not change people. I mean, but eventually, you know, the robots will do all the jobs
01:17:13 Well, no, all right here and not everyone. Hey, the the the
01:17:19 Here's my problem with what you're recording. Yeah. Yeah, this little bit. I'm recording
01:17:24 You're looking at it from the perspective of like work being
01:17:29 Something that you have to do to make the money so that you can survive and if you don't have to work
01:17:35 Therefore you will never do anything but like
01:17:39 Not yeah, I mean what I mean will become pleasure. See everybody has a hobby on top of their work
01:17:44 I mean everybody like whether it be like something that doesn't really improve your life too much like collecting
01:17:50 You know a certain thing or whether it's a creative thing like like
01:17:55 animating or making music or just fucking around with stuff like I think
01:18:02 These things aren't always work and a lot of people don't do them for profit. Oh, you know a lot of the stuff
01:18:08 I do I don't do it with the expectation of making it big with the stuff
01:18:12 I'm doing I would just like to survive while doing it
01:18:16 So I think if I get the money to survive the only thing that's gonna change with me is that I won't have to worry as much
01:18:23 And I would continue to make the things that I make for the people that enjoy looking at them and myself
01:18:30 But you basically said everything I want to say
01:18:32 I just want to also add upon that that you bi doesn't mean that you won't work ever
01:18:37 That like humans want to work. I just fucking with humans motivations to do things. I've never tried it
01:18:44 No, we haven't tried well actually we have in a couple cases. There is there is a couple cases
01:18:49 That working in the traditional sense is not like also at Alaska has been doing it for 30 years
01:18:56 Humans are like a program to do
01:18:59 Natural level people want have the will and motivation to work people yeah to work and they will do it
01:19:06 Anyway, they can whether or not it's like literally like no not everybody guys
01:19:11 Okay, not everybody we have to think outside of our bubbles because not everybody in the fucking country in the world
01:19:18 Like is a patreon creator who is filled by motivation to go create stuff. Yes, it is you're talking about I'm like like collect the stamps
01:19:27 That that I'm talking about hobbies in general people are motivated. You can't this is literally people are motivated to mow their lawn
01:19:35 That's yeah, like what's your point my micro goals exist and people will work towards those goals everyone has goals
01:19:43 Outside their work. I don't see how getting an extra thousand dollars every month could possibly lower someone's motivation to do anything
01:19:50 I think people would be more motivated to follow their passions and their dreams and do shit
01:19:57 Okay, people are I mean this is a yanks to tell me it's not it he didn't make us up
01:20:03 But this is something he says all the time like like what is it like like
01:20:07 57 or 70 it's like a big portion of the population like like tons of the population is living paycheck to paycheck
01:20:13 Most people cannot afford a sudden
01:20:17 $500 bill and yeah, these people are trapped these people have no choice
01:20:22 But to do the work they're currently doing or they will be destroyed even if that work is something that is
01:20:29 They hate or it's something that is not contributing to society. This is my thing every job every job
01:20:35 I've ever had I've never gotten the feeling that I'm contributing to society
01:20:39 I've gotten the feeling that I am just lining the pocket of I'm lining I'm lining the pocket of someone richer than me for
01:20:46 No, actual benefit to anyone but that person. I don't like that framing, but I get your
01:20:53 I'm gonna say I'm gonna go on a limb and I think that's what most jobs are
01:20:58 Okay, I get your point
01:20:59 But let me even bolster your argument even more with personally my favorite argument here
01:21:03 Which is similar to yours, but it's that like a yang said I think he was talking to like some
01:21:08 Like a correctional officer or police officer who like proposed like he said like yo, yo my dude yang
01:21:14 Why don't we just straight up pay criminals to stay out of jail?
01:21:18 And if we did that we would save money and then people wouldn't be in jail
01:21:24 And that's because and we would literally be doing that because okay, that's one argument
01:21:29 Money but if you go to jail, you don't get it anymore
01:21:32 I mean, yeah, I'd be something like that seems reasonable and I'm totally not against that idea because if there's one thing I hate I
01:21:39 Realize this just the other day. I am fundamentally opposed to the idea of redemptive justice period
01:21:45 I only believe in correctional justice. You mean you mean you mean like just punishing someone out of like vengeance
01:21:51 Yes, even like if someone murders someone it is I don't think it is moral to just harm them because they harmed
01:21:58 I think the only moral thing to do is to correct their behavior
01:22:02 And if it can't be corrected then you got to put them away in some way
01:22:05 I agree that the point of the justice system should be a correction and
01:22:12 Imagine someone killed your son though. I know it's hard. Yeah
01:22:14 I know it's hard to like see that objectively and I don't I don't blame anyone for wanting murderers to be killed because they're bad
01:22:21 I mean, I get it. Yeah
01:22:23 Do you think that the that the guy who shot up that mosque shouldn't have just been shot in the fucking head?
01:22:29 immediately well, I mean, I would I think he does
01:22:33 Right now he's going to go sit comfy in a jail, which is exactly what he wanted and he's gonna sit there
01:22:39 Happy as a pig and shit basically getting away with it. He that's not true
01:22:46 He's gonna feel proud because he accomplished what he said out to so
01:22:50 Shouldn't he just instead have a fucking I'm going for the death penalty
01:22:54 I'm absolutely for the death penalty for guys like that. Yeah, kill that guy 100% for I mean
01:22:58 I mean, how does that jive with what you were just saying?
01:23:00 No, no, no, they did say it and he can't get it can be corrected
01:23:03 You know, but what if we could what if what if you we had a team of psychologists evaluate this guy and they came
01:23:09 They should be surprised not this guy's not completely insane and with like, you know
01:23:14 Maybe five years in the correctional facility and whatever treatment we can give him this guy could be
01:23:18 Rehabilitated and made a productive member of society. What if okay, you know what you're right. I contradict myself a little bit there
01:23:23 I didn't mean to do that. It's yeah, go and I'm torn. I'm honest. I'm torn about that
01:23:29 I mean, maybe the right thing to do is let that happen if it's possible
01:23:32 I don't know if you got rehabilitated
01:23:34 Do you not think that the guilt of what he felt did would weigh him down like severely?
01:23:40 I don't care about him like like I'm more concerned about like
01:23:44 The like he killed so many people a lot of people hate him
01:23:48 Like if we're talking about like yeah, you've mentioned in the past like overall like
01:23:54 happiness of like the the people like on a mean scale ever a general scale like
01:24:01 They would be a lot happier if he was put to death rather than rehabilitated and out in the world living when the people they love
01:24:08 Didn't have a chance for like a bunch of doctors to come around and fix them because they died and that was it
01:24:14 Yeah
01:24:16 Clarify what I meant is it's not that I am concerned about him and his welfare
01:24:20 I meant like if he did they get rehabilitated and
01:24:25 Then you know the realization of what he did hits him
01:24:28 He'll probably just go back to being mentally unstable because like that sort of guilt
01:24:32 I would imagine it would break
01:24:34 You can't so it would be willing to be pointless. I think that's my
01:24:41 Okay, I get what you're saying and you're probably right, but I'm positing what if we could reasonably rehabilitate this person
01:24:48 Should we do it right? No, right? I'm willing to be a little savage. Yeah, right here
01:24:52 Some people are monsters, you know like the like the great American patriot Rorschach once said men go to jail dogs get put down
01:25:04 We could turn this person into a real person again
01:25:07 Then people then other people will go and kill him because they hate him so much like well
01:25:11 I don't know about you guys that's their moral failing. That's their moral
01:25:15 Ignoring the premise of my thought experiment and it's annoying. I'm not you're not you're not Nate. I only you're one of the good ones
01:25:22 No, I'm not it's not black and white like I get that if somebody like acts in a crime of passion and like murders a person
01:25:30 Maybe that guy could be rehabilitated
01:25:32 But I mean when we're talking about this this recent mass killer
01:25:36 I mean I I watched the video it was really creepy and unsettling and kind of horrifying and it made me feel really bad
01:25:42 But like the dude gunned down 50 innocent fucking people
01:25:46 Because it was funny. He's a monster. I mean he deserves to be fucking killed. You're not you're just not accepting the premise
01:25:53 I'm saying just imagine a world where we have definitive proof that yes
01:25:58 We can fix this person and he will I think why would you want to fix them? We already have enough decent normal people why?
01:26:10 Either hippo or manchi said
01:26:13 People will come after him regardless if he's a normal human being now we then we should stop all right
01:26:18 He's been cured because it's not good to kill people period
01:26:22 and so people
01:26:24 Maybe justified in wanting to kill him if he if say he's really
01:26:29 Rehabilitated perfectly and he's just a good person now and
01:26:33 I suppose like the ideal is that when you go to jail and you serve your time
01:26:38 Then that's your time and when you get out then you're a free man and it shouldn't be a problem
01:26:45 Like so I get it. I guess I guess I'm just like in in my head
01:26:49 I'm like he's rehabilitated in like a month and then he's back out on the streets
01:26:53 I guess he would be also in jail for like 40 years or something
01:26:57 Even if this guy can be rehabilitated fucking. What's his name? Bobby fuck nuts. I'll call him
01:27:02 Mm-hmm. If like why does he deserve the chance to be rehabilitated?
01:27:09 Well, I okay
01:27:15 I don't think that this is the world we're living in I think he probably can't be fixed and this probably is a
01:27:21 Pointless thought experiment that doesn't reflect reality
01:27:24 But you know, yeah, Nate. I'm I mean I come kind of with you. I think I'm totally with you actually
01:27:29 I think that everything is deterministic
01:27:32 This guy is the way he is because this is the environment
01:27:35 He was born into and it made him into the monster that he is and I think that yeah
01:27:40 Like from just like a purely rational like theoretical perspective. Yeah, I think I would say if we could give into the motion
01:27:48 Emotional howling mobs
01:27:51 And I think that just from a baseline everyone deserves the the human right
01:27:58 This sound this sound I just want to say this sounds like I'm defending this person. Yeah
01:28:04 Yeah, yeah, I get I get where you coming from, but I'm afraid people will interpret that's what we're saying
01:28:09 I think also I do I'm coming from is like
01:28:12 It's it's far more attractive
01:28:14 The idea of pre-habilitation like
01:28:17 To make them so that they didn't do it in the first place rather than fixing them afterwards
01:28:22 I feel like fixing them afterwards is
01:28:25 It like even if it's a good thing
01:28:28 It feels like it's a wasted effort because this person already did this horrible thing and these people are dead
01:28:33 And also like there's also never like like because he already did a thing who says he won't do it again
01:28:39 Even if he's repealed
01:28:44 Have a world where he was fully rehabilitated
01:28:48 Even so no not even so that's okay major's arguing just that you can't that it's impossible
01:28:53 I mean if I'm acknowledging. She's almost definitely right
01:28:59 Is that repentance is a privilege of the remorseful if you're what if he had
01:29:07 Genuine remorse he doesn't he doesn't have it now he killed for the people
01:29:12 Can we please just substitute forget the masher let's substitute with him Timmy who stole the cookie from the cookie jar
01:29:17 Can he be made to redeem himself? Can he be forgiven for his deeds?
01:29:22 He committed a sin what if we could fix him so he never steals another cookie from this cookie jar
01:29:27 I mean does he deserve another chance? I mean, yes, should we restore his cookie privileges?
01:29:30 I mean, yeah, if he feels bad about it. Yeah, but if you sit in there in the corner all smug like hey
01:29:34 Hey, I stole a fucking cookie. You can't do anything about it. Yeah, he never like you again return to the premise
01:29:41 What if he was fixed for real
01:29:45 Okay
01:29:49 But I'm
01:29:52 Talking about a mass killer. All right doesn't deserve the chance
01:29:58 I'll I'll I'll bite right the cookie jar
01:30:03 People the people other kids who would have got cookies. They're mad at this guy who's eaten all the cookies and he's been perfectly
01:30:10 Rehabilitated he's never gonna have another cookie again, and he's really sorry. He's like man. I can't believe what a shitbag
01:30:16 I was still I've deprived others of their cookies and it was wrong and I'm so yeah
01:30:21 So like I can never make up for what I've done, but I'll spend the rest of my life trying
01:30:25 Yeah, so like he's he's remorseful. He's in the playground all the other kids still remember I think like
01:30:34 The I I know what the problem is I know what the like like I
01:30:39 See like in the hypothetical situation where he is perfectly redeemed and in the future like you can only know through hindsight
01:30:45 But whether or not he steals a cookie again
01:30:48 So we have a future machine
01:30:50 But like overall people are more annoyed
01:30:54 I think if he like if he got like a face change and like a name change and you just like nobody even knew that he was the same guy
01:31:01 Then I guess yeah, it'll be a little different. Yeah, it's like well that cookie guy. I did it. That's it
01:31:06 It was all a trick. This was all a trick to get you to agree to let the mask off and I did it
01:31:14 Let me speak there is a difference though in here like in this situation this hypothetical
01:31:19 It's not equivalent because what the damage he did it can be sort of like
01:31:24 Repaired with the fact that you just get him by more cookies
01:31:27 But what you know what the guy did well, I'll never get those eyes back
01:31:31 Well, no, no, what I was thinking is like the cookies is
01:31:35 And the people who love them like family members and friends those the kids who are annoyed
01:31:40 That they cookie got eaten listen, okay
01:31:42 Here's the problem. The problem is that other the the problem actually in this instance
01:31:47 Let's say we can perfectly cure this person. So they know we like the we have a future machine
01:31:52 We know they would never do it again, but the problem is
01:31:55 Everyone else because everyone else we would have to cure them of their
01:32:00 Emotionality and their irrationality because they just won't accept or believe that this is true
01:32:06 Even if we know it's true people are too emotional. Yeah, so the problem actually lies outside that one person
01:32:11 It's with the rest of us human beings. What I don't I don't care if you're that
01:32:15 I don't think that his right to be rehabilitated this hypothetical person doesn't have to be a mass killer
01:32:19 But I don't think that a person's right to be rehabilitated outweighs the other people's right to live who died
01:32:25 You're just not doing any good at that point
01:32:27 You're only getting revenge is because it makes you feel better and this person, you know in this instance in this metaphor
01:32:33 They've been redeemed and they won't do it again
01:32:37 Resources wasted on like recalculating that guy and then like all the other people who want him dead
01:32:43 Now you're bringing in this whole deviation of resources. Let's say we're in the future and there's machines and we've got infinite
01:32:48 We're in the game at this point the hypothetical is so unrealistic that it's sort of it's no
01:32:59 He's never gonna be like I in a perfect situation
01:33:02 Yes, it is good to rehabilitate something if everything lines up and it's we got to me
01:33:07 We got we got hippo on board. We got on there. Yeah, but in reality, it's so much further from that than well. Yeah
01:33:13 Yeah, I don't think we should actually do this in reality
01:33:17 And that situation where everything is perfect and it lines up perfectly and you can rehabilitate a person with a snap of a button
01:33:22 Then this shit wouldn't even happen
01:33:25 Okay, well, hey, that's that's a fair but what if I guess but what if it but just in the I mean let's add to the metaphor
01:33:31 What if it did just one time?
01:33:33 Stupidly unrealistic
01:33:38 Okay, I guess my only point is that yeah
01:33:39 I think you know in an ideal world where we could do this if your goal was to do the best good for the maximum
01:33:45 Yeah, then then yeah, I think the right thing to do would be yes
01:33:49 Let's let's hit our rehabilitation button fix this person give him a face change give him a new name send him out somewhere to be a
01:33:55 Citizen no more problems ever happen. Yeah, that's probably what I would do
01:33:58 I don't like it because this person is a monster and deserves retribution or but red yet true
01:34:03 But retribution does not I'm not arguing from emotion here. I mean don't underestimate my true blackpilled apathy on all things
01:34:11 I'm not saying that killing him would make me feel better
01:34:14 I'm approaching this from a purely logical
01:34:17 Vulcan standpoint where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one if you kill one person
01:34:23 Maybe you can be rehabilitated
01:34:24 But if you kill two people then I think that those two people's rate to live outweigh your right to be rehabilitated
01:34:29 And it exponentially grows the more people you kill so if you kill 50 people and that's so you're saying then that's like
01:34:34 50 times zero the zero is your right to be rehabilitated 50 times. Oh you're saying oh you go to
01:34:41 So you kill so you kill these people and then they get you in the in their chamber in their rehabilitation chamber and we like
01:34:47 We this person's fucked up
01:34:48 We should definitely press this button to fix him and make him good and send him out again
01:34:52 And you'd be you'd be there in the in the in the the department in the oh god
01:34:56 What do they call them in in in 1984 the the building like the Department of Love the Department of Plenty
01:35:03 But yeah, the fuck there's so it's not department, but whatever you're in there in the whatever of love and you're like
01:35:09 Okay, sir or madam madam president. Don't push that button. He does not deserve to have the button pushed
01:35:17 He deserves the death button push which is right next to us
01:35:20 We couldn't we shouldn't we shouldn't fix him that we should kill him. I'm saying everybody gets one
01:35:28 Okay, you get one murder one
01:35:31 You can be rehabilitated that's a life for a life if you murder more than one person then you then you're done. You're dead
01:35:37 We kill you
01:35:39 Hmm. I I don't I see where you're coming from. I see it
01:35:43 Yeah
01:35:46 I think as a as a young man as a yang man in the yang gang
01:35:49 I appreciate numbers and your numbers are adding up and making sense to him and watch out jessior. You'll see his yang fang
01:35:59 It's like christian when he said that you'll see my fangs. No, I gotta bear my fangs. Yeah
01:36:06 By the way, see my oh don't even we don't talk about the yang wang
01:36:10 First of all agree with Ben
01:36:12 second of all
01:36:14 What do you guys think is more cruel the death penalty or life in prison because I this could go either way
01:36:20 Um, I think I think death penalty is cruel. I think death penalty is cruel
01:36:24 I think life in prison if it were me. I would much prefer a life in prison to the death penalty, but that's just me
01:36:32 I'm just I'm just sitting here reflecting on the on the flawless perfect utopia that I just accidentally created in this argument because think about this
01:36:39 If you were only allowed to kill one person then you would only kill the people who really deserve it
01:36:45 You'd only kill someone you really hate. I guess so that's like Dave chappelle's bullet control argument
01:36:50 Yeah, like what if like what if each bullet cost $10,000 you would only use them if they really
01:36:56 That's right. Was that chris rock? Oh, I think you're racist. Yeah, I think you're right actually
01:37:01 Damn it. That's okay. You get one murder and you get one being racist
01:37:05 Okay
01:37:10 I'm in deep deep racism debt
01:37:13 Uh, yeah, all right. Well, I think we got a lot done here today. That was yeah, this is good
01:37:18 We were exacerbated. Well, wait. No, we've excised our demons not exacerbated them. Tommy Wayne sure has a funny name. That's what I learned today
01:37:27 Hey, hey guys. Do you want to change your topic very quickly to something else? Hell? Yeah, go for it
01:37:33 Did you know that there are pigs that are fluffy?
01:37:36 No, I knew that there are they make pig. Do they make pig? Do they make pig wool?
01:37:40 Whoa, no, but look at it. That's that's like um one of those images that like combines two things and with an outline
01:37:48 It's just it's just like human beings both a swine and a sheep
01:37:52 Hey, uh
01:37:54 Hell, yeah, I have I have one I have one thing to say. Uh, this is not directly F too much hip of saying this
01:38:00 I know this is this is not this is not directly this is not directly related to yang per se
01:38:05 But it's sort of in line with my whole, you know, my whole like radical
01:38:08 I guess am I a radical lefty now? I might be I'm not sure
01:38:12 Um, possibly but I was I was rewatching some videos and there was one that I thought was really great and really thought provoking
01:38:18 And uh, it's it's by this guy
01:38:20 I I found him because I was on the rfck twitter and I just saw a link to this guy called thought slime
01:38:27 And I thought that's a cool name and I thought and I followed him on the rfck
01:38:31 He's like one of the like four people that the rfck twitter follows because he has slime in his name
01:38:36 But he but he is like a radical anarcho communist. So he's like he's as bad as far left as you can get
01:38:42 Um, I see a video of his called all cops are bad. He sounds sounds balanced
01:38:47 He does have one called all cops are bad
01:38:49 He doesn't like the institution of the police and he thinks it should be like radically restructured is the idea
01:38:55 But he's got one video called um capitalist entitlement
01:38:59 And uh, and I think that one's really great
01:39:02 And I would encourage anyone to watch it and let me know what you think in the comment
01:39:05 Could you give me the general synopsis?
01:39:07 The general synopsis is that people say that like lefties are entitled because they want government benefits
01:39:12 They want you know, they don't even want to work for it
01:39:15 um
01:39:17 And his basically his argument is that like the like the way that capitalism allows certain individuals to amass
01:39:24 Insane wealth on the backs of like a system that they did not build themselves that was created communally by
01:39:30 You know americans and by people large and by workers, but like all like all the um
01:39:36 You know the the wealth and the talent and stuff like the the benefits of like the people
01:39:41 That they should be profiting from themselves get siphoned into the pockets of like, you know
01:39:45 Like the rich oligarchs and technocrats just based on how capitalism operates as intended
01:39:51 And and the idea is that like this is why capitalism is flawed and why it is like an inherently exploitative
01:39:56 System and anyway, I really like that video and I think it makes a lot of good points in a short time
01:40:00 And I don't want to just directly quote it all so I don't know
01:40:03 I thought maybe people should check it if you feel like it check that one out
01:40:07 And I don't know let me know what you think in the comments, uh, because I am a big fan of all that
01:40:12 Uh, yeah, I just wanted to I'll have to think okay. You know what I have to counter that uh go listen to
01:40:17 I don't know any video by rucka rucka ali. I don't fully agree with all his ideas
01:40:22 But he is the purest objectivist. I've ever seen um, and he really straight up believes in that stuff
01:40:29 And I am not a hundred percent on his side and all those things
01:40:32 But we overlap in the majority of our ideas
01:40:35 So I don't I don't have a specific video, but I'm just countering this leftist indoctrination that ben's attempting to do
01:40:40 It's not an indoctrination
01:40:41 I just think that maybe because like a lot of I don't know because like on youtube
01:40:46 You are way more likely to get recommended like anti sjw. Shit like you're like like
01:40:52 YouTube will send you down this fucking rabbit. I have to stop you there
01:40:55 YouTube will send you down this fucking rabbit hole of like of like sargon of a cod and like armoured skeptic and all this
01:40:59 And all this weird like crypto right wing youtube will send you down whatever passage is related videos
01:41:05 But which okay, but which one is more like there is which one happens to more people
01:41:10 Which rabbit hole do more people get sent down by the youtube algorithm. The answer to that question is left wing
01:41:16 Because tim cool just did a video on this. Okay. This was a couple weeks ago
01:41:20 I think where he summarized and he's on the left. So this is his team. I know people mean about him being
01:41:25 I mean, this sounds like one data point and an anecdotal argument that's coming up
01:41:29 Okay, he cited a study and I don't know how comprehensive it was but but the the gist of that was
01:41:34 I'm just saying there was some evidence to the contrary that was a study
01:41:38 And I don't know what video it was but he references a couple times
01:41:41 Uh, so I'm just saying I've heard points and this wasn't just him making it up
01:41:45 He was citing a study by I don't even remember who but it was real and I saw the chart and it's out there somewhere
01:41:51 So I just think it's more of an open question. Well, that's interesting. That's interesting. Okay. I guess my only point
01:41:56 Oh, I'm trying to say is I think that probably our audience just from what I've observed probably skews a little bit in the anti
01:42:04 SJW
01:42:05 Direction and you know, I wonder about that. I really do. I mean, I don't know. I don't know it. I don't know for sure
01:42:11 I guess we do
01:42:13 Like digi's audience would be like, you know
01:42:16 Lefty guys because digi dabbles a lot and like lgbtq stuff and uh, I don't know
01:42:21 I mean a little bit the anime culture to me seems more lefty in general
01:42:26 I um
01:42:27 I'm not sure about that. I think digi was just a source of a lot of viewership
01:42:31 I get a mix of both. I don't know. I mean time to time because I listen to
01:42:34 Well, what is it?
01:42:35 Every viewer of ours is transsexual and also gay or something like that. I mean transgender. I think right
01:42:41 It seems to me that a good 90% of our audience or if there is a difference of our audience girls with dicks
01:42:48 Um, I don't know but I don't know. I just want to point this out because thought slime is not a huge channel
01:42:53 I think he's only got like less than 100k. Oh, he's got less than me. Oh, thank god. I don't pay attention
01:42:58 Thank god, I think
01:43:01 Specifically the stuff he says in the video called capitalist entitlement is not
01:43:05 Stuff that I've heard repeated a lot around and I think it's interesting. So that's my recommendation
01:43:09 Ben, I suspect put it in the show notes. Okay. Would you willingly call yourself?
01:43:14 Someone like a leftist like someone on the left. I would call myself a leftist. Yeah
01:43:18 I would call it. I would definitely call myself left leaning for sure if it is anyone that would consider themselves
01:43:24 on the right here
01:43:26 In terms of economics, I definitely am on the right. That's specifically economics people
01:43:31 I definitely lean left in terms of like a social policy. So
01:43:35 Just saying I don't think I'm not sure any of us would call ourselves right leaning
01:43:39 But I mean, I think maybe some of our audience think we are
01:43:43 I think that's very because I wouldn't because we've said the n-word
01:43:46 All I know is that I'm real right and I don't believe in it
01:43:50 Left and right is totally arbitrary. Okay. Well, again, you need the four quadrant spectrum
01:43:54 You need the four point of liberal uh and authoritarian versus, you know, uh, not leftist and rightist, but you know
01:44:02 That's a concern. I'm definitely in a flushed quadrant. Yeah, whatever
01:44:05 So, I mean, I think most of us if not all are pretty much very high on the like liberal side as opposed to authoritarian
01:44:12 I mean to me, that's the most important one. I mean, I'm not sure. I I generally don't know
01:44:17 I struggle every single day with looking myself in the mirror and not being the perfect
01:44:24 Centrist god that I know I want to be and I'll pretend to be
01:44:28 But knowing that I just have that smidge of devil that smidge of left-wing politics in me
01:44:33 Makes me so genuinely upset that I can't fucking like grapple with it. You should embrace it
01:44:38 You should embrace your devil munchie. No, I shouldn't it's not fucking right. It's it's so fucking
01:44:44 It's not right. It's it's not right. It's left. It's so disgusting to lean in to be on the left or on the right
01:44:50 It's fucking like that's horrible. It's really important. It's I I don't I I'm are you serious?
01:44:56 I really hate that attitude. You know why you say that
01:45:00 No, I really I really really hate the attitude that you have to be on like the far-flung edges of society
01:45:06 I didn't say that. I just think I think centrism is like a non-position a lot of the time
01:45:11 I hate when people say that that makes absolutely no fucking sense
01:45:17 You one should never okay
01:45:18 You should never come into life thinking I'm going to be a leftist or I'm going to be on the right
01:45:24 You should obviously like think about the arguments one by one
01:45:28 And then as a result of those positions on arguments the rest of the world will conclude in response to them
01:45:35 They find you on the left. I'm not saying you should pick a side and then and then align yourself with whatever that side believes
01:45:41 I know I'm just I'm just and I understand how someone could have a mix of opinions that brings
01:45:45 Here's why this conversation
01:45:48 Here's why it's totally circular and worthless. Sure. The term centrist is a fucking straw man
01:45:54 There is no such fucking thing as a centrist
01:45:57 And when people try to like shame centrist like oh centrist are just fence sitters. No, they're not
01:46:02 Nobody is exactly in the middle on everything
01:46:05 Everybody feels one way about one thing and another way about another thing and that's how you should fucking be
01:46:09 You should tackle problems in your own brain on an individual fucking basis not according to what your fucking team is
01:46:14 Okay, okay. Okay. I don't think ben was arguing. I agree. Okay, but what munchie is saying is that he wishes
01:46:20 He were a centrist and what is that if not picking an alignment and trying to align your values with that? That's what i'm saying
01:46:25 I don't know that was munchie
01:46:27 That seems like exactly what you're arguing against what what what i'm saying is okay
01:46:32 I I believe what jesse said that everyone has opinions. I don't think anyone is actually going
01:46:39 I'm gonna be a centrist and i'm gonna be in the center of all positions. I think they are
01:46:44 What about boogie boogie is literally that
01:46:46 Well, I think he's trying to fucking have empathy and dismiss and denounce people who won't be on the extremes
01:46:52 I'm sorry
01:46:54 When I say I want to be more of a centrist
01:46:56 I mean that I think that I easily dismiss people
01:47:00 Of more often than not like a right-wing perspective
01:47:04 And I wish that I were not so biased in that way and I wish that I was able to more
01:47:08 Accurately engage with them and and I wish that I had more of a balanced perspective in life and in politics
01:47:15 I feel it's too easy for me to just completely like align a lot
01:47:19 Well, that doesn't that doesn't make any sense if you if you okay if you feel a way about the issues
01:47:25 How does it make sense? That's not what i'm saying. I'm sorry. I'm saying that I
01:47:30 wish that I could
01:47:32 Not not I'm not saying that I want to have different opinions than what I have
01:47:37 I'm saying I want to be able to engage with people who have different opinions
01:47:40 In a more balanced way than I currently do where it's it's easy for me to dismiss people out of hand
01:47:46 I mean you could
01:47:47 Well, I mean you can engage with someone with right-leaning opinions even if you don't share them right or left or whatever
01:47:52 Well, that's what i'm saying
01:47:54 Well, okay guys on the same thing as being a centrist and we can all agree that whether you want
01:47:59 The acceleration of the degeneracy of the world to happen or you're a communist hack
01:48:04 We are all in the yang gang and we can all be united on this point, you know
01:48:09 And we could move forward. I feel I feel conflicted. You know, I think the yang gang is funny
01:48:14 But I also feel weird like am I undermining it by by leaning into the meme of it. I wonder what but
01:48:20 I mean all you're doing is saying the word yang gang. That's not all I'm saying is saying the word yang gang
01:48:24 But other people are out there making memes that are really like, you know, you know
01:48:28 Like yang is the new trump and yang is uh, is uh, yo listen to this
01:48:32 I saw a tweet from uh, okay. I hate doing this, but like, okay. I saw um
01:48:38 Contra points make a tweet that was just it was the shooter from the new zealand thing and he was doing the okay sign
01:48:45 Which we all know has the right wing dog whistle
01:48:49 Okay, that yes, that's the thing but but just in response to this
01:48:53 Yeah, the the the conclusion found by contra points was we got him all along
01:48:59 Everyone who's been doing the okay sign has in fact been a right wing evil racist monster
01:49:05 And I just thought that seems unreasonable a position to take you can't that's a bit of a that's a bit of a jump
01:49:10 There's so many people we're like we're on board. We we agree
01:49:17 I don't I don't think the right thing to do is crack down on the okay sign
01:49:22 Right and look it's fine
01:49:23 If you want to say that like I don't know if you see a person who seems spouting a lot of right wing things
01:49:28 And they're doing the okay sign
01:49:29 I think it's reasonable to develop a conclusion that looks like this person's leaning into this possibly racist meme
01:49:35 And sure enjoying it, but just what do you get from that?
01:49:37 I don't think that gives you anything. Hold on the okay symbol is like a racist thing. I thought it was like
01:49:44 Someone unfortunate. I thought it meant okay much
01:49:46 That's the thing a lot of people don't even know that it but yeah, like it is kind of it's sort of like pepe
01:49:52 You know like like pepe is some people use it as like a right wing dog whistle thing
01:49:56 Like like that's what I'm here to sound pepe back. It doesn't really mean that to everyone as a as a should post in 4chan
01:50:03 Let me just clarify the okay symbol
01:50:05 This is a fact the okay symbol was co-op if you make your fingers in a circle with the three
01:50:10 Whatever fingers up and you hold it upside down
01:50:12 It looks kind of like a w and a p which they say is white power
01:50:16 This was a made up thing on 4chan. They it was it's confirmed they made it up to confuse and like
01:50:25 Fuck people up because everyone uses the okay. I thought it was just because I thought it was just because trump does the okay sign
01:50:30 Sometimes they that may have been why they showed that it's such a tangled web
01:50:34 That the solution is just stop. This is the word renter stop caring
01:50:41 I just want to say a lot of people have made the okay
01:50:43 Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's the thing but yeah, they co-opted it
01:50:47 But that's why it's such a great weapon that so many people do it and of course they don't know that it's being
01:50:51 You know interpreted this way and like people that don't know about it might still do the okay sign
01:50:57 Um, with like and it's like oh the dog whistling even though they don't mean to on the other hand
01:51:01 I mean like even if it was like a fake made like like people that are in on the meme would do it like genuinely like
01:51:07 Yeah, I know I am right wing. I know we've co-opted this sign
01:51:10 I'm going to do it as like legitimately like
01:51:13 Exactly. It's just that you need more evidence than just the okay sign to conclude
01:51:17 Well, I mean I think I think we can conclude that about this guy
01:51:21 This shooter guy was definitely in on the the meme or whatever. I mean, I true
01:51:26 I mean, he also said subscribed to PewDiePie. I really think it's which I did immediately after that
01:51:32 There you go because he's trying and he said in his manifesto. That was a joke by the way trying to fuck up the world
01:51:38 Yeah, um and just he just did all the all the things and honestly, I can say I can just say like don't let him win
01:51:45 But that doesn't mean anything like how do we prevent him from winning?
01:51:48 The answer is there is no way because they're just fucking up speech and information
01:51:53 And uh, it is worrying and I am concerned about it. I'm really annoyed
01:51:57 Just then when Ben did the funny joke and then he had he felt the need to clarify that it was a joke
01:52:02 That he that he didn't actually subscribe. Oh, thank god. Ben would never subscribe
01:52:08 The subscribe to PewDiePie meme before that point was like one of the nicest things on the internet
01:52:13 That's why it's so fucked up with that guy. Look, obviously, okay, the worst thing to do is kill people obviously
01:52:17 I'm just saying to see people corrupt information like that. There's there's nothing that can be done
01:52:23 Honestly, I might have some eventually subscribed to PewDiePie and now I can't now I just can't bring myself to do it
01:52:29 I can't ring that bell
01:52:34 I would like to submit to the court that for some reason I had left a youtube video playing and then I have autoplay on
01:52:39 And I come back after this intense yang-gang
01:52:43 This this this mass shooting
01:52:46 Yang-gang bang you this yang-gang bang
01:52:48 This yang-gang bae I come back to minecraft new versus pro sky block in minecraft as much when am v shorts animation
01:52:58 Well, cool. That says a lot. Oh god. They're rat. They're radicalizing you
01:53:02 Look at look at this anime boy made just posted doing the the okay symbol. We've got another one. We bagged another one
01:53:08 I'll bet you boy though. He probably didn't even know I don't know. He's looking pretty white
01:53:13 Honestly, I look at this guy and I think this guy's definitely subscribed to PewDiePie
01:53:20 So fucked up would have okay, you know what let's just move past this let's get some voicemails guys
01:53:25 We gotta we gotta
01:53:26 Go on okay, but before we do voicemail voicemails

01:55:12 I would like know who the pcp fans are and this this may realize that like
01:55:17 Man, there's a lot of like creative people who's from the pcp who who who put in like voicemails and stuff like that

01:55:25 I don't know a goddamn because I because I was in the fan chat, you know, I was a fan back in the day
01:55:31 I knew who everyone's name was and I knew what their fucking deal was
01:55:34 But now like
01:55:36 Literally who watches the pcp? There's a few people in the patreon lounge who I hate and then that's it
01:55:42 Give us names. Give us names. I I couldn't I I could only like avatars. I don't even know their names
01:55:49 Is there is there people in the patreon lounge? Because is that a thing? I haven't been in there in like two years
01:55:55 Yeah, I mean this is a pop didn't briefly uh to
01:55:59 Post about 10 paces and draw and that was it. That was the last time I was there. I I I I lurk there and it just makes me upset
01:56:05 I'm there
01:56:06 Because they're all they're all just named digi heads. They're all just named digi
01:56:09 Oh god the lowest of the low all right fucking subscribe to pewdiepie if you're if you're a saint
01:56:16 If you're a saint head in the in the pcp patreon lounge make your presence known
01:56:21 Yeah, nades assemble nate heads
01:56:24 Nades are the are the that's like saying like white people assemble like we need to fight back
01:56:29 Yeah, it's it's literally the same
01:56:32 You're all fucking white except munchers. So you know
01:56:35 Why don't you hold hold a nade heads? Why don't you go hold a rose power rally?
01:56:39 Nate heads. Why don't you go fucking shoot up a mosque remove that from the podcast?
01:56:43 If you're an if you're an endless friend out there in the patron lounge
01:56:46 Make sure that you support the real shit by downvoting every episode in which we talk about politics at all
01:56:52 Yeah, I'd appreciate that and up voting every episode where we talk about video games and shit
01:56:57 Uh video games are the best everyone everyone in the pcp patreon is post yang memes, but only the good ones
01:57:03 Only the nice ones
01:57:04 There are some there's some black pilled ones out there. Okay. Well, hey, you know what I think
01:57:08 Maybe we should like take the patient lounge because we can be there
01:57:11 This is an unprecedented a lot of people do this where we have like the patron section
01:57:15 And then we just release like the discord like I have a general section for the public
01:57:19 That's how the uh, that's how the podcast one works and it's pretty great. It works. Well, do we not have do we not have that for the pc?
01:57:25 Wait, is the pcp discord only patron only patron only yes, there's no there's no non patron section. Yeah, that's correct
01:57:31 I mean there was there was a non patron pcp discord and it quickly devolved into shit
01:57:38 Well after we made the patron only one like that changed a lot
01:57:43 You know
01:57:44 Whatever like some of the people
01:57:45 Microwaved over and so it just kind of weathled out after a long time because the most devoted fans were mostly patrons
01:57:51 So they all left that one in uh, you know, you know, it's kind of a scary thought that like what I maybe like the
01:57:58 audience is like it has like changed to the point where like
01:58:02 I wouldn't resonate because like I think about like old pcp fans. I think about steve
01:58:07 I think about steel. I mean you were you were in the you were in that group at the time
01:58:11 Yeah, me and like I feel like I resonate with those people a lot to the point where it was like
01:58:16 I don't know like very fast friends
01:58:18 But I feel like maybe like I wouldn't like what if I don't resonate with the people who are like fans of the pcp now
01:58:24 That's just a really scary thought that I haven't really considered before
01:58:28 I think it's just that you were friends with them now and the you know, it's changed
01:58:32 So you just don't know and so you're comparing the good thing that you knew to the unknown thing
01:58:36 Yeah, might be bad and you know, yeah
01:58:39 I mean it's been going anywhere
01:58:41 I mean a lot of your a lot of your um
01:58:43 Let's do a lot of a lot of people you were friends with
01:58:46 In the pre you being on the pcp days
01:58:48 I mean a lot of those people are like pretty like people know their names now because you talk about them
01:58:53 That's true. So, I mean they're they're kind of a sort of
01:58:58 Click within the group, I guess. Hey guys, it's me the pizza party podcast. Oh my god
01:59:06 Let me tell you my opinions on the mass killer of the boss. Oh god. No. No

02:02:19 Gold standard that's deep lore
02:02:22 Uh, did people even know about gold standard? Do they know about gold standard and angel food?
02:02:27 Uh, they might if you have an angel food cake the tea vap
02:02:31 Well, I mean we'll we'll get into that. Well, they're not gonna be at it anymore because we've been disowned. Um, that well, that's fair
02:02:37 Yeah, sorry guys gold standard and angel food are out
02:02:41 Um, scrubbed from the workloads. Well, that was well, that was heartwarming. That was nice
02:02:46 We're ready to sour your
02:02:48 Attitude and drawers because we've got uh, the perfect digi bro impress impersonation. Wait impression impression. Let's let's hear it go
02:02:57 Hey, so I don't have anything really insightful to ask all I want to do is my digi bro impression. So, uh, uh, yeah
02:03:05 Here I go
02:03:08 Anime is a japanese colopilism for smoking dank weed
02:03:16 Disconnect that's all you get. Yeah, that's it. You're over. Yeah
02:03:21 That was terrible. Why did you put that in?
02:03:24 Because it's fucking funny is why dude. He said like weed. That's like not what you supposed to be. You're fucking fired
02:03:32 I really I'm I'm quite happy with the hatred for that man. That was immediately a risen
02:03:39 Nate that's cruel
02:03:41 Well, how was that cruel? That was just fucking funny
02:03:43 I liked it writing him to laugh at him and then
02:03:47 And I didn't I was laughing with you guys. Well, I'm curious
02:03:51 I like dumb voicemails. What do you want from me? Does the impression get more elaborate or is it just that basic all the way through? No
02:03:58 I think he mentions lollies, but like that's basically it
02:04:01 I put that in solely for the anime is a japanese colopilism about smoking weed
02:04:06 Jesus
02:04:09 His impression that's my impression that everybody stole
02:04:12 questionable
02:04:13 That's that was a questionable voicemail inclusion. Uh-oh my position is on the road
02:04:17 Someone else might have to do the extra unpaid work. We're gonna finding the voicemail
02:04:22 We're gonna impeach you four percent. You get four percent, Nate
02:04:25 Okay, I got paid the same amount before and after I started doing the voicemail. He didn't get any more administrative fees for the voicemail
02:04:33 And we appreciate it. You fucking hack. I thank you everyone. Okay. Uh, let's move on next one is from
02:04:38 Okay, this is from like f1m. I get I think is the name. Okay, uh, go friendship
02:04:43 So I listened to the pokemon podcast and I do not understand how people even took this long to talk about the pokemon match up
02:04:49 Communism versus capitalism when capitalism is just better pokemon
02:04:53 Now granted in all the high level replays of pokemon battles that you can watch
02:04:57 Communism always chaos capitalism
02:04:59 But that's only because communism uses the move self destruct. In fact, that's what makes communism such a weak pokemon
02:05:05 Because it only knows the attack self destruct
02:05:08 So even when capitalism is knocked out communism still dies on the other hand
02:05:12 Capitalism is a great pokemon with an extremely high attack stat and great bulk. There's only one big problem
02:05:18 It's only attacking move is false swipe
02:05:20 That means when your opponent sends out a pokemon mass starvation or widespread poverty
02:05:25 Capitalism can only be a large part of it, but we'll never KO them
02:05:29 But that is so much better than communism which can always kill its opponent
02:05:33 But will always kill itself and as stated by the official rule set of the pokemon vgc
02:05:38 Also known as lock theory of economics if the move explosion or self destruct leads to a double ko the move user will be declared the loser
02:05:46 Also a quick message to jesse. The reason why anarchy is banned is because it's a dragon type pokemon
02:05:50 That only knows a move outrage
02:05:52 It resists everything and we all know that the only good fairy type pokemon good virtues of the people
02:05:57 Has too low of a base attacks that fight it despite the type advantage
02:06:00 Leading to this boring ass meta where the only pokemon that can beat anarchy is another anarchy
02:06:07 Hell yeah, I appreciate that was smart
02:06:11 That was way too high brow
02:06:13 We are clearly lit. I think we're living in the brightest timeline right now
02:06:18 I'm trying to laugh about fucking dude smoking weed
02:06:21 Yeah, I know I love I love that like the meta, you know the meta is just so rich and so strategic
02:06:26 There's so many options that clever shit out of here
02:06:29 We're dumb dumb on this podcast. Well, okay. I've got good. I understood everything guys
02:06:35 I'm sure you did. I got all the references shut up boomer playing pokemon
02:06:39 Okay, you know if you want to dumb, I've got what you need because the next voicemail is from riddle my ass batman

02:10:32 I've been eating with a fork just this giant plastic bin of lettuce and nothing else
02:10:38 There was like one tomato in it
02:10:39 But mostly just lettuce and I've just been just devouring it the whole time people come up to me and they're like
02:10:45 Nate, why don't you ever eat salad dressing on your salad and I'm like because it's gay, bro
02:10:50 I don't need that extra garbage. I just want to chow down. Nate on my name. What what salad dressings keto
02:10:58 Not not ranch dressing. It is. It's all fat
02:11:02 Well, okay, but I'm not on keto. So I don't I'd have to analyze whether or not that's keto
02:11:06 Like you know, just necessarily better
02:11:11 Is part of gang gang gang gang gang gang is part of keto eating things that are keto even if you're not hungry
02:11:18 Uh, no, not really. I mean not really. It depends. No, actually a lot of people fast on keto
02:11:25 Yeah, is there any benefit to keto if you're like underweight and you're trying to gain weight as some people are?
02:11:31 No, I don't think so. Okay. Just curious. All right. Uh, I'm not I'm not sure, but I don't think so

02:11:59 Why didn't you warn me about this chugging the bean juice?
02:12:02 What are you talking about? I specifically told you you have to drain the gunk from the can you don't eat it in the soup
02:12:09 That's pretty gross. That is gross. I think you're gross too and weird and you deserve to be rid of your bean juice
02:12:17 Um, do not drink your beans. I'm I'm imagining him just just scooping out the beans thrown away and just chugging it right out of the can
02:12:25 Just chug that juice if you if you like the texture with all its nasty beans all its nasty collected beans sediment at the bottom
02:12:31 And it is a problem
02:12:32 I can't help you with that my dude. This is on you. This is on you
02:12:36 Okay, you know what? I was gonna play this one that was this guy called in his gimmick was it was the pth
02:12:42 wsep
02:12:43 Which is the something like
02:12:45 podcast on someone else's podcast episode one, but you know what it wasn't that funny
02:12:50 Is it is it the is it the one about did you didn't did you mention a podcast where they review other podcasts?
02:12:56 And people and people in the comment I on the episode I was like I want to hear that and people in the comments said don't it's shit
02:13:02 Well, okay, I don't know if that was this or not
02:13:04 I I mentioned because I that guy I respect your effort, but it wasn't that funny. So I'm skipping it. So there you know
02:13:09 You've been addressed. Okay. I appreciate that. Yeah, I thought you would I thought you okay. So next one is from
02:13:15 Oh semi normie guy semi normie guy. Okay commence, please
02:13:22 Any day now
02:13:24 Is it I spelled I spelled play wrong I spelled
02:13:27 Pally as but Pally in the thing. I'm so sorry everyone. Okay
02:13:31 So a lot of young people struggling to find a purpose in life join the military because they think it's a good way to contribute to something
02:13:37 That's bigger than themselves
02:13:39 I'm 17 now and I've begun to consider doing the same
02:13:43 It's not that I don't think I can find purpose outside of the military
02:13:47 More that I recognize that it's the most apparent option for me to have the largest net benefit in the world
02:13:53 And because it's hard and I think it would make me a better person
02:13:58 What are y'all's thoughts and do you have any advice for me?
02:14:02 Don't first of all he sounds american right, so I'm uh some of that my connection died
02:14:07 Yeah, I missed a little I missed a little bit of the middle of it
02:14:10 So did I but I I think I'd get the gist of it and my advice is
02:14:14 Don't join the military to be part of something because that's a crack of shit
02:14:18 Join the military to have a comfy cushy job with benefits and a lot of pay
02:14:22 It sounds particularly get a job in the military that doesn't involve actual shooting and getting killed
02:14:28 It sounds like he thinks that the military would be good for him personally
02:14:32 Which you know a lot of people say because like it teaches discipline or whatever, uh, which I mean
02:14:37 Could be true. I mean it's work. It's it pays really well and it has tons of like benefits and stuff
02:14:43 So yeah everybody joined the military. I mean selfishly don't do it for anyone else. Don't do it for your country
02:14:48 No, no, no, no, no, no, no don't I mean because that's that's what he let he didn't say I'm trying to find a good paying job
02:14:54 He said I'm trying to join something like a movement or whatever
02:14:57 Uh, wait, did he because I missed the middle. So did he say just I I want to be part of something?
02:15:02 So yeah, that was just gist. Okay. Well, I don't I don't like I mean
02:15:05 unless you
02:15:06 Really passionately believe that like american foreign policy is great
02:15:11 And you want to like personally put your life on the line to enforce it because you believe in it that strongly
02:15:16 I guess in that case. Yeah, join the military to be part of something
02:15:20 But you know, I don't know what the reason I don't love the military particularly. I'm not I I'm very anti interventionist
02:15:26 But uh, like what what about someone who like like they they recognize that there's flaws with I mean you could argue massive flaws
02:15:34 I get it uh with the way the american military does stuff
02:15:36 What if you think that like I want to make a positive change to some degree in the military?
02:15:40 Yes, you have to take orders, but like if you're out into shit, perhaps you can you know
02:15:45 Make changes from within. I do you think is that uh, okay? Here's the thing
02:15:50 I mean, I think to do that you would need to be an officer and I think without a college education
02:15:56 You have a cap on how high you can rise. So like I mean, I I think if you join the military
02:16:01 They will at some point like pay you to go to college and get a degree which will probably allow you to advance
02:16:06 I think probably if you want to be a high-ranking like guy making decisions in the military
02:16:11 Your goal should be to go to college and then join the military and I mean, you know, there's different ways to do that
02:16:16 military and otherwise
02:16:19 But like just joining the military as like a you know a base recruit is probably not the way to do that
02:16:24 You know what this you know this brings to mind though the lack of community in I don't know America in general
02:16:31 And how I don't know with the death of religion nothing has replaced
02:16:36 I don't know what you mean by that the I mean, yeah, there are more
02:16:39 There are more people that are identifying as non-religious that number is growing
02:16:43 But the number of people that are identifying as like devoutly religious and evangelical christians is also growing
02:16:50 Okay, that's fine. That's fine. That's not really what I mean scary by the way
02:16:54 Well, I mean, I hate religion more than anyone in the world. So I'm totally it's not even just that it's religion
02:16:58 It's that it's evangelicals which are I mean, am I crazy? Are they scary? I think they're scary
02:17:04 Um, uh, well, I find religion pretty terrifying. These are these are the millets
02:17:08 These are the militant ones that are gaining traction
02:17:11 Well, okay. Okay, sure. That's we're becoming we're becoming more just like in politics
02:17:14 We're as a nation we're becoming more divided organizing more. Yeah more people are not
02:17:19 Centrist or not send more people are not moderate christians more people are either atheists or fucking
02:17:25 The pray the gay away ones. Okay fair and that's a that's an issue that should be addressed
02:17:31 However, I got on the subject of thinking about it fair enough on the subject though. Oh, I just pray the gay is not religious
02:17:38 Yeah
02:17:39 Indeed in in relation to this guy's comment though. I think the relevant thing to me is that uh, uh, I do feel that like as
02:17:47 Uh, a larger population a larger amount of the population gets less religious
02:17:51 Even if you know whatever they polarize more and some people get more like I do think that those people
02:17:56 Like there's a strength in a collective belief structure or whatever of like, you know christianity or judaism or you know
02:18:03 Whatever it is. Uh, and I do like this guy's saying he he he wants to be a part of something
02:18:09 And I think that is a very common thing that a lot of people are lacking
02:18:12 And I do not have an answer what I personally believe in I don't think is actually good enough
02:18:18 But it's this like starfleet like humanism
02:18:21 Kind of I mean, I guess we know we have a name for it
02:18:24 What's that? It's weird utilitarianism. Obviously. Oh, right. Yeah, of course weird utilitarian. Yeah, I forgot
02:18:30 Uh, uh, but like I the the problem with that
02:18:33 I think is that it's very impersonal
02:18:35 And I don't think human beings get much value out of particularly abstract concepts like that
02:18:40 Including me include like on a day to day. Do I feel more fulfilled?
02:18:44 Think about that
02:18:45 Not really because my actions aren't like if you're in a church group and you can go like hang out with your peeps
02:18:49 And you can go have a personal relationship with god as they lie and say is the thing that you're doing
02:18:55 That probably is very good. And you would appreciate that
02:18:58 um
02:19:00 I and I don't but good answer
02:19:02 But I mean form a community somehow you
02:19:04 I mean, I think you would agree that uh church is not the only way to get that sense of community
02:19:10 Uh, but you know what though? I think it's like in practical terms. I don't know
02:19:15 What your average like, uh
02:19:17 Non-religious person will replace the thing that is lost. How about uh, I mean, how about like a volunteer organization?
02:19:26 Yeah, how about competitive gaming, bro? Why not? Why not?
02:19:31 Sounds great. That sounds awesome. Well, that doesn't sound bad a fandom on tumblr. That was me
02:19:37 Sure
02:19:38 For you know what it become become a furry become a furry. You know what it is though. I become a fucking juggler whoop whoo
02:19:45 Yeah, they have a community tight. They have a community tight community
02:19:49 I don't know. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. He wants to be a part of something
02:19:52 Uh, join join rfck join join join join endless war
02:19:57 And sign up for the pc pyramid scheme. We'd appreciate that
02:20:01 Um, I don't know. Uh, okay. I'd say you got to form a community somehow. Um
02:20:07 Meet people with like-minded ideas in your community
02:20:11 Maybe join clubs in your area like being part of the anime club was actually helpful and good for me in college
02:20:18 And having something like that. It's just like a good thing to do. So I guess what we're saying is like, um
02:20:24 If you want it this guy wants to join the military things, it would be good for him
02:20:27 Do it
02:20:27 I think we are in agreement that it's not a good idea just to be just because he wants to be a part of something comma
02:20:33 Anything in all caps, you know on on a practical level
02:20:37 Like if someone's just desperate for meaning in their life and they don't have a solution
02:20:41 I I would never say this is like a great idea, but like if you really need something
02:20:46 I don't know. I mean, that's I think of worse ideas. I just don't want to leave him with like no
02:20:52 I don't know no answer. My answer is don't do it for that reason alone
02:20:56 Do it if you do it if you think it will benefit you in
02:21:00 Whatever that means like yeah learning discipline the fact
02:21:04 Yeah, just the fact that it's a secure job if you joining any group just for the practical benefits
02:21:09 That's like that's like being religious because like you're scared of hell. I mean, that's why most that's why most people join
02:21:14 Have jobs just for the practical benefits
02:21:17 Right. Uh, I mean job. Yeah, you know being in the military offers relatively like the you know, best pay most most security
02:21:24 Most benefits. Maybe it's just pragmatically the best thing to do. I don't know brotherhood. I mean if you're in like the marines
02:21:29 I don't know how the army's like, uh, I don't know that probably goes a long way to make you feel like you're part of something
02:21:34 I don't know. I don't know. I mean, it's tough. No, it's tough. It wouldn't be it wouldn't be my choice
02:21:38 I feel like
02:21:39 Yeah, work is work if you can make money doing something do it make your money and get out
02:21:45 Yeah, but he wants to but like belonging to joining the military. I mean, you know, that's gonna come with
02:21:50 You're gonna be you're gonna be the product of your circumstances. You're gonna
02:21:55 I don't know. I don't I'm not trying to shit on veterans. I'm not trying to shit on veterans
02:21:59 But there's like there's a military mindset like people have a
02:22:02 If you know, it changes what you believe it changes what you how you see the world that experience is gonna affect who you are
02:22:09 I don't know. I mean, so I have to think about like if you think I feel like I feel like I feel like
02:22:14 Military people they come out like they they tend to come out, you know, more nationalistic. Maybe more right wing. I don't know
02:22:21 Oh, well, okay. Is that necessarily bad? I can't claim it. It's necessarily bad. I think that's a generalization
02:22:26 It's not it's not my favorite, but whatever. I think you're the military people I know of
02:22:31 That's not everyone, but I think that's the trend and and like responsible people
02:22:36 So like if you're looking for something to make you a responsible adult being in the militaries
02:22:42 It seems to work a lot of the time. I haven't I haven't ever met a military man
02:22:47 Or woman who was like a slob and a lazy piece of shit. Sure
02:22:51 Actually, I mean, it's so there's some military my mom told me like so there was this guy
02:22:57 back in the thing. Yeah, he
02:22:59 Currently lives above my apartment and before he went to military. He was
02:23:05 Kind of rude and a bit disrespectful and he was a bit of a hassle
02:23:10 And he made a lot of noise and and was a bit of a slob, but then he went to military and when he returned
02:23:14 He he was like a completely changed person. He was more nicer to my mom than he
02:23:18 Discipline can be a valuable thing in life. Sure. Sure. He became more responsible, you know, I I have
02:23:25 Thought previously about joining the mill. I've never seriously entertained, but I have dabbled with like man, wouldn't that be
02:23:32 Nice to just go through a process might be really hard might be terrible
02:23:36 But you come out on the end like it just seems to happen that you like if you make it you're now like organized
02:23:42 You're more like goal oriented
02:23:44 It can give you like some companionship and I've met, you know, again, these are just the practical benefits. I don't
02:23:49 I'm not a military guy for sure
02:23:52 But I don't know so I've kind of thought along the same lines a little bit as this guy
02:23:56 Let's talk about the community more about just the practical better
02:23:57 There's nothing that can possibly be wrong about getting as much money as you can while you're young
02:24:03 That's fair. That's just don't be one of those
02:24:05 Just don't just don't become one of those fucking
02:24:08 Manga-loids who goes and does basic training and then washes out and comes home and struts around town with their fatigues on like
02:24:15 They think they're hot shit and everyone should bow down to them when they didn't do shit and they ain't shit and they never
02:24:20 Going to be shit. I don't like that guy. Agreed Jordan. I don't like I don't like my friend from high school Jordan
02:24:27 Specific person I'm talking about. I hate you. You cock-sucking piece of shit. I hope you're dead
02:24:33 Excellent, okay, let's let's switch it up and go from discipline to raw pleasure
02:24:39 Because let's check in with our boy center point who's reporting back from his he was in cancun
02:24:45 Last week and was asking us for advice on what to do and we all resoundingly told him
02:24:51 Fuck some island pussy my dude. Smash that shit wide open. I did uh, I did
02:24:58 And let's find out but mage did not fair
02:25:00 Okay, mage was the conscientious objector
02:25:05 Uh, I actually don't know where it is. No, it's in mexico, isn't it? Yeah, okay. I'm wrong. Oh, is it in mexico?
02:25:12 Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right, but he was talking about being on the sea and enjoying the sun
02:25:16 So, okay, it's it's like I was actually imagining it was in spain, uh, but whatever. Oh, yeah
02:25:20 Okay, I thought I don't know why I thought I was not anyway. Let's hear center point. What do you got for us?
02:25:24 Go
02:25:26 Hey guys
02:25:27 I'm back from oh, yeah, cancun man and I gotta say I

02:25:37 Oh god. All right, so no whores were involved in the story
02:25:42 Oh, okay. I didn't hear your advice. I don't limit our whores center point. He didn't hear it in time. I know morning
02:25:48 I went out and uh got myself on a fucking water jet pack and water jet packs are pretty like in mario sunshine
02:25:55 But they're also impossible to control and I may or may not have crashed directly into the water
02:26:00 Uh three times, uh, and by the time I heard
02:26:04 The podcast and this great sage advice that you've given me
02:26:08 Yeah, correct. I was in pain
02:26:12 Oh, so much pain
02:26:14 Uh, so I appreciate the advice, uh, sorry that I completely and totally failed
02:26:21 Hey, man. Yeah
02:26:23 Whoops, he didn't let us down. He won't you let god down that one if only we'd released it sooner
02:26:29 Well, you know, this is a great life lesson. Never trust a jet pack
02:26:33 When when he says jet pack does he mean like a fucking mario sunshine ass? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they got water jet packs
02:26:40 Wait, is that real? Yeah, they're real Ben. They're fucking real. I never heard of that. That's awesome

02:37:55 I mean, maybe I'm tempted to do that. So you gotta finish soon so I can do that
02:38:00 You know, I don't know about you guys, but I feel like a great weight
02:38:04 Relatively speaking is off my shoulders. I've got a couple more that I'm gonna be finishing soon
02:38:08 I feel like I really am turning the page that I've unburdened myself of a lot of problems
02:38:13 I feel good
02:38:14 I feel like I've completed a bunch of projects and I'm almost down to the bunch more
02:38:17 And then I'm really gonna be launching into some new shit and doing good. Dude. I gotta say I feel the exact same way
02:38:22 You know, I finally finished that great bugbear
02:38:25 10 paces and draw and then just like a couple days later. I bang out
02:38:29 Nuts the beginning, which was pretty fun. I feel
02:38:34 Like I like a little bit before 10 paces. I posted a new vapor's page for the first time in a while. Yeah, I'm I'm with you
02:38:41 Uh, you know what? Let me just say on 10 paces. I think we all got a little bit of the rad con bug
02:38:46 Or the the bite just a little bit because I'm not gonna overburden myself again the same way that I was
02:38:51 With rad con 3 and stuff. But but and you know more than that watching rad con
02:38:57 Rather watching 10 bases and draw live
02:38:59 Which like the structure of that show was absolutely perfect for a premiere. There was an arc
02:39:05 There was a narrative like live as in like everyone in the chat for the premiere and stuff. Yeah, exactly
02:39:10 People were there was great. People were fucking dope and like like every round people were like screaming like who they were like
02:39:16 It's gonna be munchy. It's gonna be ben. No tom gang. Tom gang
02:39:19 Yeah, and people went nuts every time there was a there was an elimination
02:39:23 That was like the perfect show to be doing a premiere. Yeah, it was so good. It was the best
02:39:28 It was such a good time
02:39:28 So I don't know about you guys, but I'm feeling great about a lot of things going on with me and with the pcp and rad con 4 when
02:39:35 Uh, I I perpetually I perpetually feel like uh, I don't get to work on the projects that I want to and I'm bogged down
02:39:43 Do you know what you mean? I want to uh, and so I I've felt like that for half a year now and I continue to do
02:39:47 Yeah, yeah when you see any light at the end of that tunnel anytime soon. No
02:39:52 No, okay. I I was feeling that way for a long time like maybe the better part of a year
02:39:57 Um, but I mean, I guess I guess hindsight will tell if it's over or if this is a false light
02:40:03 But I'm trying you know, I want to capitalize on this feeling now. I feel like I finally have a chance to get to get back
02:40:09 To uh, you got to ride good vibes while you got it
02:40:12 Exactly and I've got I've got my big ass biggest we had whatever coming out in 43 minutes
02:40:18 And I'm pretty stoked about that. Oh my god, and I've got a video
02:40:22 I've got a big video coming out and it's gonna be fucking terrible
02:40:28 You guys ever you you're right a thing like a thing and then because you're editing it
02:40:33 You have to listen back to it and while you're listening back to it and editing it
02:40:36 You realize that you don't agree with yourself at all
02:40:38 And everything you say is fucking stupid and you're going to rightfully get crucified
02:40:45 And you're going to have to make alt accounts to crucify yourself because you fucking deserve it
02:40:49 It's that's justice to down go down vote. You're on video for that. Stay. I'm looking forward to it
02:40:54 We gotta protect this from getting into the algorithm. Were you saying something mage? No
02:41:00 No, my life my life my life is perpetually like that one terrible joke character from disney's the hunt back at
02:41:06 Notre Dame where he gets full. Oh, you mean the hush back of Notre Dame
02:41:11 He gets freed from his place like his like I don't even know what you call it
02:41:15 This is like old timey prison where you just like stand in the middle of town with your hands and your head
02:41:19 Locked inside a bar that he gets the stock the stockades right the stockade
02:41:24 And then he walks a little bit and then he gets trapped inside of another prison cell after rejoicing that he was free
02:41:29 That's what my life is continuously. Are you are you like I know what you mean?
02:41:32 Are you like sideshow bob in cape fear just stepping on rakes over and over again?

02:41:42 I'm done with the district thing now. I can do all the way. I have to edit that show
02:41:46 Okay, you know guys, uh, I mean I I the reason I'm feeling good is because I've made some hard choices and I've cut certain things
02:41:53 I've come to conclusions about certain things and uh, it hasn't been easy
02:41:57 I've had to made some hard
02:41:59 Basically cuts of things I wanted to do
02:42:00 But I've just got a I've got to prioritize not even just the stuff that I want to do
02:42:04 But that the audience wants to see that will be good financially and you know what?
02:42:09 I don't know. I feel like I've arrived at a pretty good place with what I'm going to be doing next. So
