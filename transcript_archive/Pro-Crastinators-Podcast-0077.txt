00:00:00 I was like, oh cool, these guys seem really dedicated to their story, they're really creative,
00:00:05 and they have a whole team, and they do a lot of stuff, and I respect this, I like it a lot.
00:00:11 But then, I went and I found their other Patreon, and it was for the porn version.
00:00:19 The canonical porn stories that happen with the same characters in the same thing, and I was like, oh, oh dear.
00:00:26 I don't, I guess I just don't respect it as much.
00:00:30 Hello everybody, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:35 I'm your host, not best guy ever, Tom Oliver!
00:00:40 Wow!
00:00:41 Already an improvement.
00:00:43 And we're here today to talk about some shit that we don't like, but we fucking hate,
00:00:48 but today we also have with us, Mumkey Jones!
00:00:52 Hey everybody, it's me, the deep-voiced, leather soothing sounds of Mumkey Jones.
00:01:00 I'm scared, the Davoo!
00:01:02 I got my standing mat ready.
00:01:05 Ben Saint.
00:01:09 I'm here to take a shit on all the pieces of garbage on the internet today.
00:01:14 I can't wait, and the responsible one keeping us all on track, hopefully, the Hippocrite.
00:01:21 No, that's not me at all. That's that you got that wrong. That's the wrong description. Okay. What do you want to be then?
00:01:27 When you go up, okay?
00:01:30 You're on the right track, and now you're probably thinking but PCP
00:01:36 Didn't you already do this topic before?
00:01:42 Good question, viewers.
00:01:45 I'm glad you're paying attention, but it's well the answer is welcome to
00:01:50 creators we hate part two
00:01:55 The day of recording this today is
00:01:58 International podcast day. This is a thing that apparently exists Twitter told me so so and Twitter doesn't lie
00:02:04 So what better things to do on international podcast day than to revisit a topic?
00:02:09 We've already beaten to the ground and just
00:02:12 Accept our nature as human beings to just thrive on hatred and things that make us angry
00:02:17 So that's what we're doing today more things that we hate
00:02:20 But before we start another announcement that coincides with
00:02:24 International podcast day is that we finally did it and by we I mean me because no one else did it, but me I spent five
00:02:31 grueling hours getting the PCP up and updated completely on iTunes and Google
00:02:39 For all of you fucking peasants use an Android phone everyone's instead of an iPhone
00:02:44 Everyone who has been requesting that we put it on iTunes go you can now go and there it's there
00:02:50 We do that right now. It's there right now every single episode correctly formatted with description
00:02:55 It took way too long, but I did it. I bit the bullet for the team as
00:03:00 There it is as someone who's never used iTunes and legitimately doesn't know
00:03:05 I'm what I want to ask this question for the sake of people who are maybe retarded like me
00:03:08 How do you find the PCP on iTunes? Well, it's a huge pain in the ass
00:03:13 Basically, what you have to do is first you have to install iTunes
00:03:16 Which is like basically knee-capping your computer for life unless you're a dirty Mac user
00:03:20 But if you can get past that first step if you install iTunes definitely uncheck the automatic updates
00:03:25 Otherwise, it'll never leave you alone
00:03:27 Okay, but you just go to the podcast section and you there's a search field you search for the pro crastinators
00:03:34 And it should pop right up. I've tried it multiple times
00:03:37 It has worked. It's the same thing on Google Play music if you're on Android
00:03:41 You just go to the podcast section you search for procrastinators and pops right up along with some other shitty podcasts that we're gonna kill someday and
00:03:48 Yeah, that's that's that's how it works. It's pretty simple unless you're retarded, which I mean some of you out there
00:03:53 I'm sorry. They're just gonna have to consider the audience
00:03:57 Consider the audience we're talking to I gotta say I never wink wink nudge nudge
00:04:01 I never thought I'd see the day. I never thought I'd see this happen. Well, but here we are
00:04:07 The Urban Dictionary definition of hatred
00:04:14 Urban Dictionary defines hatred as the trademark sign of love between two cynics often accompanied by sarcasm and clever insults
00:04:23 What the so true that sounds like me and Ben
00:04:27 Yeah, geez, maybe I've learned something about myself today. It sounds like a home stuck to me. I don't know about that. Yeah
00:04:34 Hussie wrote that um
00:04:37 Who has somebody who they really fucking hate?
00:04:42 It's me it's me. All right, so my
00:04:46 creator that I hate is
00:04:48 He's a pretty big one. He created the universe. It's God
00:04:56 Where do we go from here did young shells and just walk into the room
00:05:01 and
00:05:02 It's probably not what you think but because I see I see God as like the John Tron of deities, you know
00:05:12 Created the universe and he had some pretty good content in like, you know
00:05:23 Yeah back when he was in D is you know just doing all that stuff
00:05:26 But then he sort of fucked off after the Bible and he's he's never been he's really done nothing
00:05:32 He's there's there's been no miracles. There's been no new stories
00:05:36 He really he's just sort of the face of the earth and I works at Bed Bath and beyond, you know
00:05:40 He pulled us just say the same thing
00:05:43 He promised this big like second coming of his son and fucking up everything and you just collected all the followers and their
00:05:49 Money hasn't done shit with it. What it doesn't we've all been funding him this whole time
00:05:54 Just not he's not and he's not even transparent about it. It's somehow he's gaining more followers despite not doing shit
00:06:01 Not a single update on Twitter or anything, man. Do you know how many views the Bible has?
00:06:08 The ad revenue must be holy shit
00:06:12 Here's the here's the real question though. The Bible
00:06:15 Does Google let it be monetized? There's rape. There's murder
00:06:18 There's there's tons of things in there that really shouldn't be advertiser friendly
00:06:22 But seems like it gets a free pass for his like history of like, you know, creating everything. What a nepotism
00:06:28 Yeah, I don't can't say I'm a fan that this that just makes me hate it more, you know
00:06:32 It's nepotism and it's the appeal to authority the divine authority
00:06:37 We do
00:06:41 That was um, yeah, that's it. That's all I got I couldn't think of you wanted to do this episode
00:06:46 You're like, I got this great got this great yucker for the beginning. They're gonna be chucking and yucking all night
00:06:51 I was just gonna duck out for the rest. I've done his part collecting his check. He's good to go
00:06:59 Well, I've got a YouTube creator that I think yeah, let's bring it back down to the realm of mortal men who we can actually
00:07:06 Really sink our tea to figure it out. Literally. It's a recent event that I think should piss all of us off equally
00:07:14 Maybe maybe not a maybe not the divus in the bends
00:07:16 But I think the rest of us will have a bone to pick now. It's no secret that I hate great a under a
00:07:23 But typically it's just in the past. It was because I didn't respect his content and I thought it was unfunny and lazy
00:07:29 But boy, howdy, he made a new update video and he said one of the dumbest things
00:07:36 I think I've ever heard and it made me go from distaste to actual pure hatred
00:07:41 His excuse for not making videos for months was that he was depressed and at one point in the video
00:07:46 He says it is a literally impossible to be funny
00:07:51 When you're depressed and he said that as if it was a statement of fact and that just got my blood boiling so much
00:07:59 Instantly you think of Robin Williams Jim Carrey
00:08:03 Tom Oliver
00:08:04 Hippocrates did you throw all these funny guys who are cripplingly depressed?
00:08:09 So I'd how can he how can he put that statement out there and not expect massive ridicule and hatred, you know
00:08:15 I guess when you have all that ad revenue
00:08:17 You can you just don't have to dig deep and actually try to be creative under pressure
00:08:22 You just use coast for a while. You see, I don't think the problem was that he was depressed
00:08:26 I think the problem is just that he can't be funny in general. So he needed the excuse
00:08:31 It's literally impossible for to be funny under any circumstances let alone. Yeah
00:08:37 Doesn't matter how he's feeling. I I the first few like the very first few great a under a videos
00:08:43 I stumbled upon before he was like a big drama guy and I thought you know, that's that's kind of funny
00:08:48 It's like sort of observational humor, but
00:08:51 Since he's like he's just I I stopped following his following him since and he's like he's just stopped being funny
00:08:58 He stopped being creative or interesting. I wonder whether those are initial videos were just copied from something
00:09:05 Like sketch or sketch sketches that he's seen. I've heard he's a big douchebag
00:09:12 Yeah, I don't know much about him
00:09:15 I mean, I don't know. It's it's I didn't watch a lot of great a under a but it felt like a formula that wasn't gonna last and
00:09:23 I guess
00:09:24 that was correct because here we go and
00:09:28 He's really it was it was what I want to bring this up ended by jumping on the drama train
00:09:34 He's kept it. He's kept the lifeblood pumping
00:09:37 With that with that development
00:09:40 delicious, yeah, and and the reason why I bring this up is not because you know
00:09:44 Like we don't need to dissect his content because we can all agree like you okay
00:09:47 Maybe it was better back in the day, but it went to shit
00:09:49 But just like this one specific thing about depression is what really put him on my radar of hatred
00:09:55 And that's that's all I wanted to say about it
00:09:57 I hadn't heard that that he said that I made I think you maybe tweeted it or something. Yeah, I was just like
00:10:02 Because I was thinking about that when you tweeted it and I was like mmm
00:10:06 Cat is like that. There's probably something to that in like there's a certain type of humor that you can't do when you're depressed
00:10:13 I didn't look into it at all. I don't think he did either, but it's not impossible
00:10:17 It's just like when you're depressed everything's more difficult
00:10:20 So I think most of like all the comedians that I have as my favorites and all the ones I respect are very open about
00:10:27 Being depressed you have like a I mean Greg Gerardo back in the day before he fucking died from overdose
00:10:32 Louie CK George Carlin like all these guys were pretty fucking depressed
00:10:36 And I think it fueled their humor and made them funnier because it gives you a
00:10:40 I think a more unique and more comedic outlook on life when you wish you were dead
00:10:45 Yeah, it's weird. It's it's like he I think it's like the impossible part like it was impossible for him to make content because he was sad
00:10:54 doesn't
00:10:55 Work you can't just say that and have it be okay. You're you're just it's just a pity party
00:11:00 He's trying to throw yeah, and he's trying to write off all comedians as oh, I bet they're all you know mentally fine
00:11:06 And just because I personally could not make content because I was too lazy and depressed
00:11:11 That's that's all I gotta say about great a under a let's move on if somebody right so, you know beginning this podcast
00:11:17 I'm like, oh geez
00:11:18 I mean the only one I really have to think of immediately is I hate everything but we all talk about him a lot
00:11:23 Really my main problem with I he is that he has obnoxious editing
00:11:27 But in a way that I feel like no one else would agree with me
00:11:29 So I don't know how to make that whole rant coherent
00:11:32 But I was just scrolling around YouTube trending to look for other people and I was reminded of someone so immediately
00:11:39 Anyone who does parody songs song parodies, but we're like the the parody is that it's like a review of the song that they're parodying
00:11:48 so I believe the most prominent example is
00:11:50 The key the key of awesome we're like they do song parodies, but like it's not like its own
00:11:58 Idea, it's not like a weird out parody where like they take the lyrics and turn it into like a different song with different meaning with a different point
00:12:04 It's like it's like it's like a song about the song that it's a parody of and it always makes like some snarky points
00:12:12 I don't think I've ever seen something like that, but I can try to imagine
00:12:15 Is it like that they're just replacing words and saying it in like a slightly snarky sarcastic way
00:12:21 fucking obnoxious is what they are
00:12:23 Because it's like it's like God they have one that's a parody of bad romance, right?
00:12:28 And it's just they're like a but do it but like they change the melody it's supposed to be bad romance
00:12:33 But I guess for copyright reasons they change the song. I'm like, well, what's the fucking point?
00:12:37 I guess it's supposed to be a stylistic parody of Lady Gaga, but it's obviously trying to be bad romance
00:12:41 And this was you know several years ago when that song was new but then like it's not just Lady Gaga
00:12:45 Lady Gaga is in the song. It's a woman pretending to be Lady Gaga again. It's a parody, but it's the same fucking thing
00:12:51 I know but then there's also a lot of bizarre
00:12:55 I know I know I know but like then there's also I believe it the key of awesome is mostly two people a guy and a girl
00:13:01 So there's also Lord Gaga, right? What the fuck is the point of that?
00:13:04 So she's like I'm Lady Gaga and this guy comes in the I'm Lord Gaga. I'm like, okay
00:13:08 How is that a fucking parody of of Lady Gaga?
00:13:12 The only way I could imagine it would be is if there was a twist that they're both the same person because Lady Gaga has a dick
00:13:17 Because that's a joke from 2009, right? I don't fucking know. It's not played up that way and like also it's film
00:13:23 It's the joke supposed to be that they're saying I'm Lady Gaga something like that, but then like no they play
00:13:29 Look isn't Lady Gaga so much like this. Yeah
00:13:33 I think it's not even that I think that the joke is her name is Lady Gaga and the male equivalent of a lady is a Lord
00:13:41 Yeah, not terribly insightful and like also the music video
00:13:45 The music video is like filmed in like some random fuck-off hallway
00:13:49 That's like all white because obviously they want to look like bad romance the music video where it's all white
00:13:53 But like they obviously didn't have to budget to make a studio look all white
00:13:56 So it's some hallway and like some factory or something that they were able to find and get permission to film in so it's
00:14:02 Really fucking awkward because it's all filmed in a goddamn hallway just to get it to look white
00:14:06 And it was constantly distracting on top of the entire entire fucking premise of it
00:14:10 Just being weird and they have lyrics like oh doing weird stuff
00:14:13 You know, I believe there's literally lyric making up this shit as we go along like oh wow
00:14:19 You're totally parodying. You're just telling us what Lady Gaga style is okay. I gotcha and like they have like another
00:14:25 parody of like one other one direction songs and like as it goes on
00:14:29 it's like about how certain people react to the song and then uh
00:14:33 Then it also talks about how the one direction song is similar to the Backstreet Boys' famous song and so they're like oh, yeah
00:14:39 You didn't think we'd notice that did you but like this is woven into the lyrics of the parody
00:14:44 It's so fucking confusing the key of awesome as a parody of um of E.T. by Katy Perry
00:14:48 And it's like the whole premise of the song is about the fact that Katy Perry is trying to make a song
00:14:54 But then Kanye West is in the song and so like Katy Perry is singing to the melody of E.T.
00:14:59 Con yeah, why are you here? This is my fucking song. Don't intrude on it something like that, right?
00:15:06 Like by the end they talk about how like Katy Perry just made the song for the check or something or something fucking like that
00:15:12 I'm just like what's the goddamn point of these things. I hate them, you know
00:15:15 I hate I hate it when there's like a parody but like there's not like a strong premise to it
00:15:19 It just makes me cringe. It's what I call hashtag conceptual cringe
00:15:23 You know it sounds like it like Jen they're putting in like generic
00:15:28 Oh, celebrities just do things for the money like that's the joke. Yeah, it's not got anything to do with Katy Perry
00:15:37 Delivering the mail just for the money. What a fucking
00:15:41 Yeah, I find it to be like the worst the worst parody people like you know at least fucking
00:15:45 Rucka Rucka all these got like his own like personality and funny jokes that I like and he talks about 9-11
00:15:51 Yeah, but like
00:15:53 Yeah worst fucking parody people. It's really the um
00:15:56 It's just the natural byproduct of any medium or industry getting saturated with fucking cash
00:16:02 People just jump in with no ideas, but plenty of fucking budget and props. You know what I mean?
00:16:06 There's just I remember one time seeing like um it was fucking what's the one?
00:16:11 What's the one republic song about shooting stars and no more counting money and shit?
00:16:14 What's that one fucking stars a fucking one republic song? You would not believe your eyes
00:16:20 Yeah, something like that right. Yeah, of course. Yeah, fucking obviously. Yeah, definitely. You got it. Monkey, but like, okay
00:16:25 It's that song. It's that song
00:16:28 Like the lyrics are all the same, but it's performed by Disney villains
00:16:34 But like some of the lyrics have changed so it's like it's like it's like a live-action
00:16:39 Interpretation of some of the Disney villains in a music video and they're singing it and even King Scarra's in there
00:16:46 Just a guy dressed like a fucking King Scarre and I'm like, okay
00:16:49 It's like a cornucopia of terrible ideas. Yeah, and I'm like it's coalescing into cringe
00:16:54 Yeah, and it's like super produced probably a few thousand dollars at least probably like a studio that you know is actively producing shit
00:17:01 But they're like, okay, what are we gonna make this time?
00:17:03 Yeah, just there's just like there's no strong like premise there
00:17:06 So yeah, I hate those people and of course they get like millions of views and are super successful and you want to shoot
00:17:11 Oh God one last thing I'm like fucking there's like I remember my girlfriend playing this this like
00:17:18 Combination a medley of fucking maroon 5 just a maroon 5 medley made by some generic youtubers
00:17:24 But like a full music video and everything, you know
00:17:26 It like is mostly centered around that fucking whistle jingle from moves like Jagger
00:17:31 And I was just disgusted by the thought that people care that much about maroon 5
00:17:35 This reminds me of I think his name is Brock Baker. Does that sound familiar to anybody? Not I
00:17:43 So he he does a similar thing
00:17:45 But like he'll he'll sing a popular song but in the voice of like a hundred different characters
00:17:49 And he's a really talented voice actor
00:17:51 And I think it's like the right version of what you're describing because it's just like him standing in front of the microphone
00:17:56 And then each lyric is a different
00:17:57 Performing like a different character. So it's impressive and it's not like overly produced or like it's not trying to be a parody
00:18:03 So I think that's if you're gonna do something dumb like this
00:18:06 That would be the good way to do it, but we're what you're describing sounds horrifying bad. Yeah
00:18:13 All right, I have somebody who just who's a brand new creator
00:18:18 That's fucking horrible, and I hate it and I'm disgusting that exists
00:18:22 Susan wasiske. I don't know how to pronounce her last name. She is the CEO of YouTube
00:18:29 Oh, no, and she started a YouTube channel last week
00:18:33 Oh, no, oh my and and and it's probably the most disgusting thing ever because it's like the videos like titled something dumb like
00:18:40 How do I make videos on YouTube or something?
00:18:44 It's like I asked a bunch of my friends and so it's just like her saying like
00:18:48 I'm gonna start making videos and then it's like these are the people who are gonna help me and then it's all these like
00:18:53 It's like the rock and like a bunch of other celebrities talking about like, oh, yeah, we're youtubers
00:18:58 We know how to make you two videos and then there's like Instagram models and vinyls
00:19:02 I'll giving her advice and it's super just like corporately produced and
00:19:07 disgusting and the most horrific thing of all time and it's just like
00:19:11 Everybody hates you right now, and this is the time you decide to try and like
00:19:17 Reach out public facing like I'm just gonna sit here and have fun guys
00:19:21 It's like no get your shit back in the office and fix all the things that suck balls right now
00:19:25 What is wrong with you Tom this is an interesting scenario because you've seen it none of us have
00:19:30 I think we should all try to guess what advice she got and you can confirm if we get it, right?
00:19:36 Because I'm guessing I'm guessing somebody tells her just be yourself on camera and and the audience will follow through
00:19:42 Absolutely, that is one of the points
00:19:45 Anybody else got to guess?
00:19:47 Get a good microphone probably
00:19:50 I don't think that was mentioned, but you know real advice you'd actually should use
00:19:56 So so okay, I know I know what they said they said go to the the use the YouTube creator help tools in YouTube and
00:20:05 And you know they're not shit use them. I don't remember that being there
00:20:10 But oh they probably said upload constantly they probably upload as much as you possibly
00:20:16 Said you got it you got to be consist consistencies the most important thing just vomit out that content every day
00:20:22 Yeah, and here's anything we'll do this is the thing that I'm gonna be really
00:20:26 Really interested to see is cuz I I have ad block
00:20:30 But like is this video monetized and if it is of course fuck you
00:20:34 Because like there's only so many ad
00:20:37 To play on videos and so the CEO is gonna take ad revenue from the people whose site she
00:20:43 Like who just posted the light counter and it's 7,000 thumbs up 33,000 thumbs down
00:20:53 7,000 people are either working for Google or need to be executed immediately or they're 12 years old
00:20:58 I have to like from now on in my in my life when I see something stupid on YouTube either like a high
00:21:02 Like or just like bars are stupid comments. I just always
00:21:06 Assume it's a 12 year old cuz what else could it be? I can't imagine a real
00:21:13 Those 12 year olds are the ones who are watching your diary of a wimpy kid video and make yeah, that's where that's where I'm seeing all these likes and comments at
00:21:21 Dude fucking have the top voted comments on that video or is this video demonetized, too?
00:21:28 I mean right it's it's it's it's funny once guys, but don't don't beat a dead horse
00:21:34 That would be that would be fucking hilarious if her video got caught as like not suitable
00:21:40 Oh, man, but she would never admit I hope I hope everyone flags the video and yeah
00:21:45 I wouldn't be fucking surprised if shit loads of people like try to flag the video
00:21:49 But obviously like they're just gonna unflag, you know, the you know, you people like automatically
00:21:54 She has CEO shields and just bounces off like
00:21:57 She's got mod power. Yeah, her channel just gets no no strikes at all. It's whatever
00:22:04 Yeah, so I hate her
00:22:07 Because it's just horrible and terrible and disgusting and I can't believe I'm gonna I'm gonna keep watching and see what other cringy shit
00:22:13 That's there and just watch this site continue to fall apart
00:22:16 It's gonna be great. She have right now. I didn't even look I hope zero
00:22:22 It's got to be at least 40 you never know
00:22:27 The board of directors is all following
00:22:29 yep
00:22:32 Um
00:22:33 Well, uh, I'll go am I last am I the last one? Yeah, we could probably go around another time
00:22:40 This is gonna be a very short. Yeah, we keep going until we got a channel more hate than that
00:22:44 I mean, yeah, well, I got a I got a general one. It's not about anyone specific. That's that's fine
00:22:51 We can all jump in then go what what I the
00:22:54 just in general the thing that makes me hate anyone is
00:22:59 Just if they're it's just that they're overappreciated
00:23:02 Even if I like what they do then like if I see that they get more appreciation for it than I feel they deserve
00:23:08 I hate them. So just anybody that violates your your your personal
00:23:12 You know such such such beloved content creators such as Digi, bro
00:23:19 You have to have absolute hacks
00:23:22 And I don't I don't even think did you would disagree
00:23:24 He's said before that he thinks it's weird that he makes more money than like
00:23:29 Animators that make anime so I don't know but but but they're they're small they're small fry
00:23:34 They're small fish in this pond we're talking about someone like like Jim Sterling who I like and like I like his content
00:23:40 But he makes like he makes like 12 with like $12,000 a month on patreon for like he's been stuck at like 11,000 since forever
00:23:47 I think it's like 10,000 thing. I I know I know a pretty decent place to be fucking stuck
00:23:53 Yeah, yeah, I wish I was stuck there
00:23:56 I mean, that's how much I make in a year working full-time. So I I see something like that
00:24:02 I see something like that and like the good will that I have because I like the things he has to say just
00:24:08 Drain's away and it's left with nothing but resentment in its place
00:24:13 Just so yeah, take some solace Ben and the fact that he's gonna be dead in like six months
00:24:19 That's going good. Oh, is that true? No, but I mean well could be I mean yeah
00:24:26 Is clearly not
00:24:28 Not designed for longevity. Let's put it that way. He'll he'll be crushed under the weight of his himself
00:24:34 Is he a big fat?
00:24:41 You've never seen a gym story video the gym position. I only follow like five YouTube channels
00:24:46 Everybody keeps saying oh, mom. You are you ripping off age three age? Like I don't fucking watch that
00:24:50 I don't even know what it like I know what it is, but I have never watched the video
00:24:53 So stop fucking saying I rip off all this shit you you're definitely doing the right thing
00:24:57 There's just too much shit and it takes away from time like I'm gonna go watch Fargo season three
00:25:02 I'm not gonna watch fucking age three age three productions, you know
00:25:06 We could we could all learn something from this attitude just so we have to I was going to say
00:25:10 Another another example that that girl on patreon who does the art
00:25:14 Sakee me chan sakee me chan like yeah her art's real nice her arts real nice and everything
00:25:20 Is it worth like fucking $50,000 a month? Of course not fuck fuck right off
00:25:25 It's just like it's she all she does is she does the same like like
00:25:30 busts of popular animation characters and then behind the patreon is them without a shirt on or with tits hanging out
00:25:36 And you have to pay for that and that's how you get $50,000 a month
00:25:40 I think I think she offers like you know you get to see the process and you see like the sketches and like you
00:25:46 Maybe you can see like videos of her drawing them and stuff
00:25:49 So it's like it's kind of like disguise. It's kind of like sort of educational like ooh learn how she does it
00:25:55 But like it's also like a cam girl where the tit you're seeing are not hers installed on her body
00:26:00 But drawn by her hand, which is just as hot. Oh
00:26:03 There was that there was that girl there was that girl who who I don't know what her name was
00:26:09 But she was like some not particularly well-known artists, but she like she got in some financial
00:26:15 Trouble something in the game grumps like tweeted her around and like fucking like help this girl and they did and now she's got like a
00:26:22 Whole bunch of money on patreon and she and she kind of like started doing like some fucking quote like erotic photography on the side
00:26:29 She's like this chubby girl who like post-cropics and yeah
00:26:33 Yeah, yeah, so that's the lead of it. That's the monster. That's the kind of monster that's created by situations like this
00:26:40 What I'm gonna milk digi bro to get that sweets push that we all need to start making a million dollars
00:26:49 Soon I'm I'm calling the police
00:26:53 I'm waiting for I'm waiting for his next stream and I'm gonna swat him. We're gonna swat
00:26:58 You know come to think about it in general
00:27:00 I often find myself being find myself with a lot of distaste for like people on the internet who like do art
00:27:07 But like disconnected drawings. There's not like something big and ambitious. They're doing like a big old webcomic
00:27:13 It's actually good and stuff. You know what I mean? Yeah, like
00:27:17 Something that annoyed related to that
00:27:20 People that yeah people that have like OCs and they'll they'll draw like they'll draw like fan art of their own OCs
00:27:25 And they'll call them OCs and then but there's no story to go with it
00:27:30 And it's like yeah, like what's like in general people who like just do a lot of pictures
00:27:34 Like if I really like your art and like your attitude and I can be a fan of you
00:27:38 You know, there's there's a PCP fans who do great art and I love them
00:27:42 But I just feel like when they start becoming like personalities and like becoming famous and stuff
00:27:46 It's like are you really doing enough to justify that? Are you like weaving an incredible artistic experience?
00:27:51 I can change my life to justify you being someone who is revered. You know what?
00:27:55 I mean, I don't know like yeah, you know going wait. Can we switch topics to another person or are you not done yet, Ben?
00:28:02 No, no cool. So talking about art people, right?
00:28:04 I I was looking at the trending tab and I see there's an odd ones out video. Do you know?
00:28:09 Do you guys know the odd ones out?
00:28:12 I'm not from no style of video where it's basically just any other kind of YouTube video
00:28:17 We're like you just talk about a fucking thing, right? You just talk about a thing any topic at all, but it's like drawn, right?
00:28:23 So it's basically like desperate technique to justify my art major
00:28:28 Technique number 375, right? It's like well, I gotta make YouTube videos
00:28:32 But obviously animation isn't fucking gonna ever work on YouTube again
00:28:36 So instead you just sort of have like a slideshow of like your art to like tell us to like make a point, right?
00:28:42 Or like have a rant but instead of like Google images
00:28:45 It's like you fucking tablet all of your images, right?
00:28:48 And instead of just having an OC that stands perfectly still that you cut to you actually kind of sort of
00:28:53 animate the OC, right? So like the I've seen some of those things that that they're so
00:28:59 Like banal and like and then I this is the first crush
00:29:05 Yeah, this is me and I look like a cute little cartoon. Yeah, that's why you click
00:29:11 But instead of being a vlog they just kind of draw a bunch of stuff here. This is what happened in my life
00:29:17 Yeah, I don't I oh, but it's so relatable. Yeah, so I like that
00:29:22 I just don't understand how it even achieves critical mass like that, right?
00:29:27 Yes, like something yeah, and generally related to that is like people like owl turds and like the four panel so relatable comics
00:29:34 Yeah, and how those just blow up everywhere. So like the odd ones out
00:29:38 It's really just because a lot of people who consume that stuff are like
00:29:42 Teenagers and they just want somebody to say I know what you're feeling because you know parents don't do that
00:29:48 It's just young young people who haven't heard it before the thing that I've always found interesting about people who make content like that
00:29:55 It's like how can that feel satisfying?
00:29:56 You know because right when you think about it the people who like that content they have no they don't care about you
00:30:02 They don't care about your vision. They like their content because they see themselves in it
00:30:06 So so when they like your work, they're just it's just an ego trip like it's just like so they just see themselves in the work
00:30:12 And that's why they oh this this is me
00:30:14 But like you the artist and the content itself is completely
00:30:18 Substitutable with anything else they would find like you're not you're not building anything for yourself the minute you stop doing that
00:30:24 No one's going to care anymore, and it just feels like such a fragile thing to build I
00:30:29 Think like the people who make that sort of content aren't
00:30:32 Clever enough to realize that that's true, and they will just see all this praise and think oh they love me and they'll feel fine with
00:30:39 That well no that was what I had in mind, but of course I guess it's all true
00:30:43 But okay, so the odd ones out specifically I posted a screw I posted an image of like the OC for that channel in the chat
00:30:49 It's like this big tubby white and by white
00:30:51 I mean like actual white guy with a big old mouth mouth red pants, and he presents himself
00:30:57 You know the characters all like I'm a cutesy you know you know and I get it
00:31:00 You know I've drawn OCs of myself, and I just draw it all like cutesy and simplistic whatever I get that kind of fucking ego thing
00:31:06 Right, but like the guy who voices him you know the real guy does not convince me that he's like a lovable tubbable guy
00:31:13 Right I heard about him during the fucking cool cat controversy because it wasn't just I hate everything who got his videos
00:31:19 Fucked with this guy also did a cool cat review now like the I hate everything review of cool cat
00:31:24 I have not seen the I hate it the odd ones out review of cool cat
00:31:28 I never bothered to see them, but one thing that was really telling to me during the the daddy Derek
00:31:34 Controversy is that you know he didn't delete every fucking video review of his channel
00:31:38 He didn't ever go after YMS directly as far as I know I mean he did like cut ties with him eventually
00:31:43 But like he didn't want to take down YMS's review
00:31:45 But he did want to take down the other guys's reviews even though YMS's review was pretty cutting
00:31:50 But it was respectful and based on what I could tell it seemed like I hate everything and odd ones out
00:31:54 We're not being very respectful to Derek Savage or whatever this fucking that's not savage
00:31:59 I don't know fucking everyone's names are but like I watched odd ones outs review videos talking about the controversy with
00:32:07 Derek that he had and he showed a bunch of fucking emails that
00:32:12 He he and Derek had exchanged with one another, but like it felt like a weird sort of like leak
00:32:17 It felt like he shouldn't have been showing this on the internet
00:32:19 It felt like a violation of violation of privacy and also like the way he wrote some of the emails just seemed like he was being
00:32:25 Addict to Derek and I'm like yeah, like I know legally the laws and you publish emails without permission. That's disgusting
00:32:31 Yeah, it was fucking weird, and I think he had like certain reasons or justifications, but it was fucking weird
00:32:36 He was not convincing me that regardless of his legal us
00:32:40 Justifications did he have like the the etiquette justifications, right?
00:32:44 And so I clicked on another one of his videos where he talked about his time working at Subway, right now immediately
00:32:50 You know every Subway employee I've ever met was addicted. I know where this is going
00:32:54 but like
00:32:56 He talked about like, you know, it was a shitty job and he had like shitty customers and just talked about like various things and like
00:33:02 He
00:33:04 Thoroughly failed to convince me that like all these different little stories
00:33:08 He was talking about and complaining about weren't just him being bad at working at Subway
00:33:12 Like it's always interesting to me when like someone tells me their story about people who pissed them off people who fucked them over and yet
00:33:18 Even though I only heard it from their perspective just by gathering the information
00:33:22 I disagree with their their own conclusions that they weren't in the wrong
00:33:26 Like he just made himself sound like a really shitty Subway employee, but he never like really indicated as much, right?
00:33:32 Just by based on the information he gave me right?
00:33:34 He did not he did not garner any sympathy for me
00:33:37 And yet it was all presented with this big old tubby blobby white Pillsbury Doughboy face and I'm like you're fucking disingenuous
00:33:43 You're just you again. It really comes
00:33:46 Obviously I'm probably wrong, but it comes off to me like oh shit
00:33:49 I have an art major got lots of bills to pay can't make animation for a living
00:33:53 You're not wrong because I've been to Subway several times and I've never seen a good Subway employee
00:33:58 Because yeah, I know it's because it's a shitty job, but also like seriously
00:34:02 There's a fucking thing on the menu, right?
00:34:04 It's a fully made sandwich with all these different ingredients all listed all in the picture
00:34:09 I point to it saying I want that and they go okay. What do you want on it, right?
00:34:13 And I don't know when the message is gonna get up to fucking Subway corporates fat fucking skull
00:34:20 When we point at the image just give us the fucking image and we'll customize it if we choose
00:34:25 Why do we have to come up with how to make the sandwich every time, right?
00:34:28 So yeah, that's the cup that's the best when I tell my mom to make the sandwich. She just fucking does it
00:34:33 I don't got exactly the kitchen and point out every little one on corporate cuckoldry that the odd ones out
00:34:39 participated in so I don't I don't yeah, I don't sympathize with him
00:34:43 But he presents himself a sympathetic, you know, I fucking get it, but yeah annoying
00:34:48 Yeah, I have I mean, it's really I was thinking about like who do I hate? I don't really hate like many people I hate like
00:35:00 Practices that people do and it's really always based around like Ben was saying
00:35:05 Undeserved stuff like if somebody just sucks and they're and they're getting no views, then I'm like, well, I mean all's right with the world
00:35:13 Market has spoken correctly
00:35:15 Wait, so wait wait timeout Tom. So are you do you mean to say that sometimes the market can speak incorrectly?
00:35:24 According to my own subjective interpretation. Yes
00:35:27 But it's the invisible hand. It's like whatever happens
00:35:31 Balls I mean you saying you've never seen have you never seen something monkey that's been like real popular and you're like
00:35:38 I can't believe people like this. I hate it. I wish it would go away
00:35:41 I can see why I personally don't like it
00:35:43 But like I said earlier all every youtuber is 12 years old so I can see why it is popular
00:35:48 Well, that's my whole thing like why I wouldn't like like like at the end of the day people are gonna like what they want to like
00:35:53 And I'm just saying in my personal opinion
00:35:56 They're retarded and so when when my personal subjective
00:36:00 Opinion on what the way things should be and life itself syncs up
00:36:03 There's like there's a quaint little moment of Zen where I'm like, yes, things are okay guys
00:36:08 And then I shouldn't say that the market is wrong. You should be like well, I guess I disagree with the market. I
00:36:14 Was talking about my perspective what the market be not the market
00:36:22 Well, it's like let me let me give another example
00:36:25 It's like when someone when someone gets popular like by accident or like by random chance
00:36:31 Or just because they happen to be in the right place at the right time and thereafter
00:36:34 They they continue to make content that is just like what anyone else makes but because they struck at the right time
00:36:39 Well, the iron was hot their videos can succeed their art can succeed or whatever
00:36:44 Whatever it is where other people's wouldn't even at the same level of quality, you know what I I have I have the guy
00:36:50 I hate the guy who changed or created the YouTube algorithm. I
00:36:56 Hate that guy whoever he is. He created that programmer. It's probably Nate fucking
00:37:00 I
00:37:02 He made it so that he made it so that people can just succeed by you know random chance
00:37:08 And then they don't need to be good and everything sucks and a YouTube sucks
00:37:13 You can only be popular if you make videos about gals or videos about diary of a wimpy kid. Yeah, that's pretty much
00:37:22 Yeah, fucking spider-man and
00:37:24 Can I say that I hate Nate? He's one of the creators I hate
00:37:28 Already I already called him out as one, but yeah, please go on
00:37:31 Not not do you think he's gonna listen to this episode?
00:37:34 Of course nothing to do nothing even to do this content is contents fine
00:37:38 But can I just say the man the man I have a bone to pick with the fact that a couple years ago
00:37:43 We went to a convention and I owed him money and I had to pay him back
00:37:46 He was like I you you're short 80 cents, buddy. I had to pay Palom 80 cents. Oh my god a load of fucking shit
00:37:52 Oh my god
00:37:54 Bastard ever and he's not here so I can say it Nate that was fucking gay. I was not cool with that at all
00:38:02 That's a little weird. It was it was it was disgusting
00:38:06 Yeah, but you know, it's only 20%
00:38:09 20 cents off and just like almost a whole dollar. That's like I'm that was like, you know like two packs of gum
00:38:15 I could have enjoyed it. I'll never have
00:38:19 Yeah, but I don't like I don't care about him I care about me
00:38:22 And then PayPal probably took out 60 cents out of the 80 cents that you sent him probably I do see the gesture
00:38:29 Yeah, I do see you wanting to get back the money you're owed
00:38:32 But when it's such a little amount and it's one of your friends. That's when it sort of gets weird
00:38:37 And the thing was is like this was like like back in like I think it was like 2014
00:38:41 So we had only known each other for a little while. So I was just like, oh, oh, huh, how can I make our relationship even stronger?
00:38:48 I know. Oh, bitch about 80 cents
00:38:53 Sounds like him
00:38:55 Back so yeah, I just I had to get that off my chest. It's been burning in my soul. You can't say that on an episode when he's here
00:39:02 No, I couldn't
00:39:05 Beat you up. Yeah, I can take potshots and not have to feel guilty about it until later. Oh, hey guys
00:39:11 I got some good news
00:39:12 Digi bro, you might have heard of this guy. Did you bro?
00:39:15 He told us in the chat that he is like 16 episodes behind on the PCP so we can talk shit about him too
00:39:21 And he'll never know. Yeah, but the hammer won't come down for another several week
00:39:26 Yeah
00:39:28 We can avoid punishment his is wrathful vengeance. Yeah, we're in the eye of the storm right now
00:39:33 We can do it
00:39:35 Funny though is we could tell the audience like go tweet this thing at Digi and nobody explained
00:39:41 What's going on and then he's not gonna have any idea where it's coming from
00:39:44 We like what should we make everybody tweet at Digi right now something stupid
00:39:49 Pictures of like cantaloupe or something shit like everybody just tweet Digi a picture of a cantaloupe and yeah, the hot new meme
00:39:55 Oh, yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, that's something
00:39:59 And no one tell him why we're what you guys
00:40:03 Yeah fucking mean if you if you fucking tell Digi what's going on
00:40:07 I'm gonna come to your house, and I'm gonna give you a
00:40:10 I want so much on this on the PCP Twitter. No, no, no second chance. You're done. Yeah
00:40:17 This is serious. Yeah, but I'm in charge of the ship now and there's new rules
00:40:21 What I want to see what I want to see is Digi just coming into the chat one day and saying what the hell is up
00:40:28 And for us to just type LOL in caps
00:40:31 Oh
00:40:34 See folks if you let this happen, I will send the screenshot of us all laughing at Digi on the PCP Twitter page
00:40:42 Looking forward to that what a reward
00:40:45 What a good meme. Oh, man. We're so funny on the PCP podcast legendary. We like to have jokes
00:40:52 We like to we just don't do it very often. We like that fill that audience involvement, you know building some rapport
00:40:58 Keep your eye out for the for the PCP cantaloupe t-shirt up for sale eventually
00:41:03 And in the corner of the t-shirt Digi's like sitting there with a confused face like
00:41:10 Hey guys hippo is that the end of your your your thing
00:41:14 Well, I was gonna go a bit more into go ahead. I got a good one, but I'm gonna wait for it. Okay
00:41:20 So I was like yeah the people who
00:41:23 Undeservedly get views and stuff
00:41:24 It's it's always annoying when they're just they're not very good and they don't try very hard and they get everything
00:41:29 They could have ever possibly need but what I you know what I hate specifically is
00:41:36 I had I had something in my head
00:41:38 I'm just trying to just trying to you know trying to figure think of it think of it as I say these words that like mean nothing and I
00:41:44 Really shouldn't have like continued to say one, but I just shoot
00:41:47 Just
00:41:49 Monkey you really hate people who like don't think about what they're gonna say before they say it and then they just start speaking
00:41:54 Bullshit, I thought I could remember it. Oh god. Tom is ruthless tonight. They're in everybody. I'm drunk on power now that Nate's not here
00:42:03 Now I'll kill you guys. Here's the worst type of content creator on the internet again like what Ben was saying
00:42:10 It's like a broad category
00:42:13 People who live stream video games with their girlfriends. Oh god
00:42:19 absolute shame
00:42:20 Disgusting I never watched anything like that, but just the description alone sounds more
00:42:25 That's all I got to say like does anybody want to add to this like DeVoo Ben
00:42:30 Yeah, I got don't do it. I got a thing. I
00:42:34 mean with
00:42:37 With such a practice the only reason a woman should be on a live coming to bring you a sandwich
00:42:43 Not from subway though
00:42:46 They probably made it wrong
00:42:49 She pointed in a picture you didn't understand what was going on I
00:42:54 Will say that like it doesn't matter unless if the person is funny, right?
00:42:58 But here's a thing. I hate the most of all is
00:43:03 Mike and Ryan on Cinemastica. Oh my god. Yes. I hate it. It's it's it's it's it's the same
00:43:10 Principle as bringing your girlfriend on because it's like
00:43:14 because
00:43:15 You know not all girlfriends are like perfect for YouTube if you're a youtuber
00:43:19 You just you don't look for people who are good on camera if you're a youtuber. That's just not exactly how it works
00:43:24 Really so as you know if you have your girlfriend on it's because you're there
00:43:29 They got to be in this spotlight because they fucked someone and basically it's the same thing with Mike and Ryan
00:43:36 This guy I don't say I'm not saying he's fucked. I think Ryan did fuck Mike
00:43:40 But um this Ryan guy is so boring and Mike is not as funny as James
00:43:48 Keep doing it over and over again. Why is he there killer?
00:43:51 Cuz Mike Mike starts off as the like sort of unfunny sidekick to James
00:43:56 And then we make him the main guy and then give him an even unfunnier sidekick
00:44:00 It's like it's two degrees of unfunny sidekick. That's been forced upon us. Yeah
00:44:04 Because like you know I haven't I unsubbed
00:44:07 Cinemastiker I was like phasing in and out of being subbed to cinemastiker for a couple of years like around 2013 or so
00:44:13 But I've officially unsubbed it and stayed unsubbed
00:44:16 It's just like I'll watch the ABG in episodes when I feel like it
00:44:19 Maybe I'll watch a couple other James centric videos when I feel like it right but because I'm not subbed
00:44:24 I don't feel the pressure to get back to it really what it is is the whole cinemastiker wagon just couldn't
00:44:29 Keep it's real it just kind of got fucked in the modern YouTube era of constant upload
00:44:35 It's because James just doesn't do
00:44:38 Constant uploads and he needed to like get some other like shitty people to attach on to himself to like to like pump out more
00:44:44 Content, you know like he sort of treated the the monster madness where he did a one review every day for all of October
00:44:51 Which he came up with in 2007 he sort of treated that like a big special thing that he literally said takes all year to work on
00:44:57 So for him doing consistent content, even if it's short videos doesn't work
00:45:01 So that's what has fucked his channel right and it first started around
00:45:05 2012 when he first went off to film the ABGN movie and he sort of gave the channel keys over to
00:45:11 Mike during that time and Mike made some of his own videos
00:45:13 And this was when Mike finally kind of stepped into the spotlight really up to that point
00:45:17 All Mike had done was play like special characters in certain ABGN episodes in which he was really funny
00:45:23 And he also drew AVGN title cards
00:45:25 So like he was like this guy in the background behind the curtain who helped a lot but in the modern YouTube age
00:45:31 It's like get as many faces on as many videos on as many days the calendar with as much runtime as possible
00:45:37 So James has exhausted all of the fucking people he knows
00:45:42 And yeah, it sucks. I never I've never watched the Ryan videos because as soon as I look at them
00:45:48 I'm like well this guy's obviously never gonna say anything interesting ever
00:45:53 Yeah, but whenever I accidentally click on one like I'm like, oh wait, that's Ryan immediately
00:45:58 You know backspace like I I I've never seen a single second
00:46:01 I mean, I've probably seen one video to see wait
00:46:04 This is like where I discovered that I hate this idea right and ever since then right and like
00:46:10 And like honestly equivalent of having like game grumps be exclusively Barry and some other
00:46:15 Yeah, I'm trying to think of like the least funny game grumps
00:46:21 It was like Susie and Holly only I wouldn't want to watch it
00:46:26 Yeah, the thing right is that is like good
00:46:29 I think the worst thing and I I'm gonna talk about out of my ass at least slightly because I'm like
00:46:34 Seven episodes of AVGN behind which is to say like a year or two behind but like I honestly feel as though
00:46:40 All that extra content them like dilutes the AVGN series in a number of ways first of all the set right originally
00:46:48 The eight the nerd room felt like an area in a show
00:46:52 It felt like this sort of magical property that was put together through the force of storytelling because that's how it was presented
00:46:58 Yeah, but once it's used for like everyday vlogs and all sorts of let's plays and other things
00:47:03 It just feels like this guy's room. It it breaks down the barrier right it makes it less of a character, right?
00:47:11 Yeah, oh, no, this is pretty much all just really me
00:47:14 After all right well, I mean that they don't shoot in that room really that much like they've done okay
00:47:22 Well, they've done a few let's plays and Mike and Ryan is usually just in a white. Okay
00:47:26 Well, I remember originally it wasn't like that maybe in Ryan's house
00:47:29 But like also like James like the nerd as a character like the whole fucking character thing does not work anymore
00:47:36 I mean it still works on a yeah, just not as well because
00:47:39 Everyone knows because you see him being himself so right you see yeah like like for example
00:47:44 Imagine if mr.
00:47:44 Betong did shitloads of vlogs and let's plays his whole like persona that he puts on in
00:47:50 His actual videos that he makes every like couple of months or handful of once or twice a year
00:47:56 Wouldn't work as well because you know this guy way too well like like you know the mr.
00:48:01 Plinkett series has to really bend over backwards to keep like a building up the illusion of the character by like being
00:48:06 Really extensively written having a totally different voice from what's the class that actually sounds like and shit
00:48:12 You know what I mean like they have to like really
00:48:15 Do so much to keep justifying the character and it works fine, but with James versus the nerd
00:48:19 There's not that much difference
00:48:22 It's more like the nerd is just sort of certain cartoony voices James naturally does just all the time rather than some of the time
00:48:29 And it's just like he's wearing a white shirt instead of any random dark shirt, right?
00:48:33 I think actually James probably goes out of his way to wear dark shirts to make himself not look like the nerd
00:48:38 Otherwise he looks to say exact fucking same and like the whole format is just pointless
00:48:41 You know you see people like like Digi and a lot of us who originally just made like regular sized videos before the whole modern YouTube
00:48:48 Eric I kind of got like a fish it officiated
00:48:51 And they would just do regular videos and the occasional podcast
00:48:54 But once Digi started doing vlogs and let's plays constantly
00:48:57 He changed the nature of his main channel content to reflect the fact that like the way that you absorb his
00:49:03 Narrative is different now and like the AVG and format's just kind of dated for that reason and like I you know
00:49:09 There's a part of me that wants to say well James would be able to keep his head above water and make plenty of money without
00:49:15 Falling in line with the modern YouTube format just by doing a patreon
00:49:18 But he's got a wife and kid and probably still debt to deal with after that movie. So, you know, I get it but fuck I
00:49:26 Think AVG and should start wearing a hat because seeing the nerd
00:49:33 Balding is this discerning to me. Oh, I want to see that happen. He heard he's he's project
00:49:38 I mean like for example that there have been little tiny hints or like jokes rather of the idea of that the nerd shows gonna
00:49:45 Be around for a long fucking time and James is gonna get really old like like one time
00:49:49 He pulls off some games already happens right. Yeah. Yeah
00:49:51 Like there's one time where he's pulling games off a shelf to talk about a certain company and they're like now
00:49:56 This company also made this game called raid
00:49:58 2020 maybe I'll review that game in the year 2020 at the time I laughed right now
00:50:04 I'm like, oh, he's really gonna do that. You know, his fans aren't gonna let him forget that shit
00:50:08 He actually who who would have ever thought he'd still be going right back
00:50:12 Right, this was back when we didn't realize that youtubers just never fucking died and never stopped like on rare occasions
00:50:17 They'll stop this isn't like a show forever right doesn't end right just because it's just a guy because it's just a guy in his
00:50:23 Basement, yeah, we can see we can see through the veil right James actually said years ago that he's like
00:50:28 I'm never gonna stop doing AVG and even if it's only one a year because it's so it means so much to me
00:50:33 And I'm like I like that because I want to show to continue forever
00:50:35 But like he even has like a Christmas special episode from 2007 where he like he goes through the fucking Christmas Carol
00:50:42 So he sees his future self and it's like him was like a white wig and a big white beard reviewing the Wii
00:50:48 He's like remember the Nintendo Wii. Yeah, that's what they called it
00:50:53 And so he like plays boogie and like us like
00:50:57 Monkey ball and I'm like dude if if James gets to be like his fucking 60s
00:51:03 And he decides like you know what I'm gonna actually be that version of the character
00:51:06 I'm gonna grow a beard and be like a really fucking old nerd, you know
00:51:11 Yeah, I think he'll I'd still watch he will look I don't think it's and like look the show is still good
00:51:16 The show is not a wash. He actually does update the character like he updates the way the character like
00:51:22 Feels like the the style of anger that he portrays in the videos has evolved tons of times
00:51:27 So the show is gonna last forever. It's never gonna get shit
00:51:30 I am a Joe. It's just the modern format that he has to fit himself through. It's just kind of unfortunate
00:51:38 That's that's the real worst thing ever is is YouTube as a platform
00:51:43 Just becoming more sterile and cookie cutter and allowing flexibility for anything. I've I've fucking I've fucking got it
00:51:52 I've got something that I hate
00:51:53 It's another broad category and this is way fucking broad
00:51:57 This is like literally everyone is guilty of this in some way. Oh, no, and it's
00:52:02 Creators whose art is basically just about themselves or about their art. Yeah, everyone
00:52:08 Yeah, yeah, like people eat that shit up like like when a like when a story gets gets like when a piece of work gets
00:52:15 Real cheeky and like breaks the fourth wall and ooh references this song this thing or says something that only the fan base
00:52:21 Would get his little nod people eat that shit up
00:52:24 But like over you go to go overboard on that shit even a little bit and it's like what the fuck am I watching like this
00:52:30 This thing that I'm consuming is just jerking itself off about how important it is and why do I even bother, you know?
00:52:36 And when someone like yeah, like like drama channels like great a under a or like
00:52:41 I don't know the fucking so many people like like they're they make YouTube videos like vloggers
00:52:47 They're making YouTube videos about the fact that they make YouTube videos
00:52:51 That's the story that I'm watching and it's like oh my fucking God
00:52:56 Fuck do we need Ben you have no fucking idea? I have that I have that like a pevney like weekly if not daily of like
00:53:06 One so you just need to have it once
00:53:09 I don't know what the word doesn't go anywhere that that that moment of morbid
00:53:14 Nihilism I guess because it's like I often am triggered by it by something like something
00:53:18 It's very obvious like a lot of rap which is just like I'm a rapper and I'm rapping and people think about this about my rap
00:53:23 And this is what their reaction to my rap is and this is my response to that reaction
00:53:26 It's like damn like the whole point of rap
00:53:28 Hey, that song is really good. Yeah, I know right. I don't know there's there's a place
00:53:32 There's a place. Oh, yeah, like meta commentary in art
00:53:36 But like when when I feel like what someone does is just comment on themselves. It's like yeah, fuck this guy
00:53:43 Yeah, yeah, so like so fucking so I think about that
00:53:46 But then I think well ultimately everything you tell even if it's a fictional story
00:53:49 It's just things you're thinking about yourself. It's just it's just all you and your ideas
00:53:54 That's just represents you but then like deceptively
00:53:58 Woven into a narrative and ultimately everything's like that and then I think well literally everything not just art
00:54:03 But like you know people selling hot dogs like they're just there to perpetuate the selling of hot dogs walking down the street
00:54:09 You're just there to get somewhere everything everything doesn't have a point like everything is like
00:54:14 Sort of goes into my general philosophy of no matter what life you're living
00:54:17 You're always thinking you're not really living the life of living, you know, like you're not really really living a real life
00:54:22 It's like if you decide to live your life one way
00:54:24 then all you can think about is how you're not living all these other ways that you could be living and
00:54:29 Representing all these other things that you could be representing and ultimately there is no point and ultimately everything is basically life
00:54:34 Is a game of hot potato where you go from one vice to another vice to another thing you have to do and
00:54:39 Until you're dead right and that's like the whole point of life
00:54:42 So the whole point of a YouTube video is just like it's just justify itself
00:54:46 And then you're watching the video and then that's the point and then you go to buy a burger and like the whole point of the
00:54:51 Burger is just to get a burger the burger doesn't enhance your life in any way
00:54:54 But then like you can get money and the money doesn't enhance your life because you buy things that don't enhance your nothing
00:54:58 Nothing, but nothing matters. There you go
00:55:00 So basically you can go from complaining about meta commentary going it immediately escalated to absolute nihilism pretty quickly
00:55:07 So that's kind of why I try to avoid thinking that way, but it's kind of hard, you know
00:55:12 But my but my do I do I do agree that money does not improve your life
00:55:17 And I'll take that burden off your hands if you want to just well
00:55:20 So you don't worry about it anymore
00:55:21 But but I my two points are related because when when I see someone like a vlogger
00:55:26 Who whose whole deal is they just talk about themselves and their life is them making vlogs and it's a big incestuous circle jerk
00:55:33 I see someone like that and then I see someone getting super popular for doing that and getting tons of money on patreon
00:55:40 And I'm like what are these people seeing in this? What are they paying for?
00:55:44 What is that would make Casey Neistat was there was that something else?
00:55:47 I didn't more or less. I don't really know anything about him
00:55:50 But I can like the back when Pokemon go is a thing hippo, you know, but the trainer tips guy
00:55:55 I started watching this vlogger who's the trainer tips guy because he would talk about the game
00:56:00 And I was interested in the game at the time and the dude blew up and he just fucking vlogs now
00:56:05 It makes daily videos about his life playing Pokemon go and people fucking eat it up
00:56:10 And I'm like geez like just like Jim Sterling like I like this guy like I like what he's saying
00:56:14 I don't understand how it fucking can blow up like this. I don't think he deserves this much success from something
00:56:22 So, you know fucking fucking not fucking basic
00:56:27 God damn, it's I mean with trainer tips. It was really just he was the
00:56:34 When it when it came to actually explaining the mechanics of the game and what's you know the updates and everything
00:56:40 He was like the best YouTube channel for that
00:56:43 But then he did like like there were less updates
00:56:46 There was less stuff going on and he just sort of started vlogging and then vlogs became so much of like the part of the video
00:56:53 But it makes me know people got invested in his life because he's I don't know. He's got loads of charizards
00:56:58 He's just I mean he's he plays the game a lot, but he's just regurgitating stuff that like people are posting on the on the on the
00:57:04 Subreddits, he's just regurgitating info that people on the subreddits are posting. I know what the
00:57:09 What is the point? I know the reasoning I think I well
00:57:11 I think what it is is is that like people who watch YouTube generally when it's like a vlog or a let's play
00:57:18 They want to feel the company of another yeah, exactly. I was a friend. Yeah, I want to pretend
00:57:23 I understand like like I'm saying all this I'm saying all this with with the nut
00:57:27 Like I do understand the appeal because like I was watching the video
00:57:30 So I get liking it, but then the fact that like when it then it gets really popular and I'm like, oh fuck this
00:57:37 You know, this is this is what I'm this is the phenomenon. I'm describing in action
00:57:40 You're seeing it right now someone whose content I like then I see it successful and like no
00:57:43 I don't like it anymore. Fuck you buddy. Well, then let me ask you just called being a hipster
00:57:47 Yeah, let me ask you a question just to gauge which which vlogs are okay to which ones aren't
00:57:52 Okay, sure a vlog about going to a water park. Yeah, your name
00:57:58 Depend if it only if it makes less money then the trip costs well if it turns out
00:58:04 Definitely did so okay, if it doesn't turn a profit, then I'm okay. I think I put him in debt
00:58:12 Good that's true. I only like water park vlogs when the person at the water park eats a whole bar of chocolate before
00:58:21 Did he do that in the video? I think you did. Oh, yeah, that was his breakfast. You're right
00:58:27 This mystery person
00:58:29 Is them with their shirt off making like a weird gesture towards a water slide
00:58:36 But we'll never know that that episode of PCP has way less views than any other one
00:58:45 You're talking about like it's we're entering a we're entering the fucking Wally society where you know
00:58:51 Everyone is just sort of in shares just doing nothing like that's but that's the world
00:58:55 We're going to where people just plug themselves into YouTube forever
00:58:58 And all we need now is just 3d printers to make food and and it'll be done. This is why this is why I think Isis
00:59:05 Isn't yeah, I think the constant threat killed and beheaded for no reason really makes you appreciate
00:59:12 That we really need yeah, yeah
00:59:14 We really need some some strife in our lives if we're gonna do it's just a big difference
00:59:19 I think fundamental difference between the way that I
00:59:22 Especially when YouTube was branded new was like getting engaging with YouTube the way it was originally engaged with the way it is
00:59:28 Versus the way it is now and especially by like just you know kids who are discovering it
00:59:33 You know as it's already in this this modern era of like YouTube is this thing you throw on and just endlessly
00:59:40 Swimming forever, you know and
00:59:43 For me, you know for people when it back when YouTube was new and limited didn't have that many videos
00:59:47 None of the videos were that good. It was like going to like a weird store to like a trinket shop to think
00:59:53 Whoa, what am I gonna?
00:59:54 What am I gonna pick out?
00:59:55 It was sort of like going to the movies and like what movie am I gonna see like what YouTube video?
00:59:59 I'm gonna watch going to blockbuster. Yeah, it's like on a blockbuster and picking out videos based on the code
01:00:03 Right, but now it's like just you just throw something on you know and that's literally how you get popular
01:00:08 You got to get popular by like engaging the I'll throw something on audience and not the ooh what video am I gonna watch audience?
01:00:15 You know and I think it's shit and it didn't have to be that way cuz you know like my fucking you know
01:00:22 The invisible hand of the market logic goes well YouTube optimize itself or what would you know make you know?
01:00:28 Get the most eyes glued to the most screens and wreck in the most cash
01:00:32 And I think that eventually once social media has hit like a fucking
01:00:38 Event horizon where everything just spills over and it hits this like the bubble bursts
01:00:43 You're gonna see the the rise of like rebellious social medias that really focused on like culling down the quantity and really ramping up
01:00:50 The quality and like they'll finally be real competition for YouTube assuming that this fucking adpocalypse reaches critical mass
01:00:58 right and like people will will pursue these other places these other YouTube alternatives as like a fucking
01:01:04 Identity statement and like the algorithms of those websites will be all about
01:01:08 About quality over quantity and and yeah that that I feel is the only thing that's gonna stop the critical mass of longer
01:01:15 longer longer pointless or pointless or pointless or vlogs about everyone everything all the time is
01:01:20 Outright rebellion outright like the human nature's desire to say fuck you to the establishment
01:01:26 So we just got to wait for this whole vlog to get established. I believe in that I
01:01:31 I
01:01:32 Think oh that I hope you're right. That sounds like a miracle waiting to happen
01:01:37 It does it I mean that does yeah, it's a miracle because I feel like cuz I've seen a talk by a guy. It wasn't a Ted talk
01:01:47 Fears right now this was no Ted talk viewer
01:01:51 Yeah, he was explaining that the possibility is there that in the future
01:01:56 Privacy is not going to be a thing that people grow up knowing what it is
01:02:00 Technology technology is going to to turn all this sort of YouTubey
01:02:06 Just mindless entertainment into you know technology like phones and chips you put in your head that
01:02:13 Stream your whole life and experiences
01:02:16 Across the internet for everyone to see and everybody else is also doing that and it's just a big sea of everybody knows
01:02:22 Yeah, we're already in we're already entering this era with say, you know elected officials where they're constantly having scandals about things that
01:02:29 Politicians have always done in every administration every country ever
01:02:33 It's just that they never got caught because they we didn't have camera phones back then we didn't have gorilla investigators and like
01:02:39 Half the time I think like half the shit that people got that that that put Trump into the hottest of waters was like some random thing
01:02:45 He said one time at some point 20 years ago that there was a mic in front of and someone uploaded it
01:02:50 Right and eventually, you know cut to 40 years from now or even 30 years from now when like millennials start running for office
01:02:58 We're gonna have a place where like everyone who wants to be there like a fuck
01:03:02 Everyone's so fucked like it's gonna be like you tweeted this one thing when you were 15 right?
01:03:07 Well, I think it's gonna end word and you you're fucked. Well, you guys are fucked
01:03:11 No, no what it's gonna be at the end where it's gonna be a goddamn critical mass of like well now
01:03:16 Everyone is exposed on the internet. Everyone is bad. We now know everyone's dirty laundry
01:03:21 So now you have to select your vote based on entirely different parameters
01:03:25 And then people will just stop giving a shit about all those things because everyone will know who I don't know if I have enough faith in
01:03:31 Humanity to believe it'll become a question not of who's got the least dirty laundry, but who's dirty laundry's smell is the least
01:03:41 Cuz the example you used was Trump and that was some dirty-ass laundry and then he won
01:03:47 For saying the n-word all the time but hit by the way
01:03:51 My my biggest creator that I hate is Donald Trump
01:03:56 United States of America
01:04:00 Creating because he's creating plans to destroy Isis and we all know we need
01:04:04 Yeah to appreciate life
01:04:06 We need Isis to stop walley from happy ready for questions
01:04:11 Donald Trump wants to fix all our problems and I hear to say no we need our problem
01:04:15 I feel like we've been going for an hour. Is anybody else have any like last minute?
01:04:18 I think so I have a couple of ones a little quick like tiny one couple just one just one just fucking one
01:04:23 Can we do a third episode? I have only have one
01:04:26 Which is innocent obviously right and I have fuck yeah
01:04:31 My opinion goes without saying worse worse and has always been like well obviously they just slap these videos together
01:04:37 What the fuck ever it's mildly amusing sometimes if I care about the movie whatever but then no, but it's fucking nonsense
01:04:43 Yeah, well then a friend of mine recommended me these videos called like cinema sins sins
01:04:47 I don't remember what they're called, but there's this guy who like rebuts cinema sins with like just yeah
01:04:52 I mean one of the he's not like only five of them
01:04:55 Which is all you really need to be convinced most of them are of the Marvel movies reviews like yeah
01:05:00 I watched the Civil War one right right where this guy rebutted their
01:05:04 videos
01:05:05 Yeah, he made really good. Yeah, so like at first
01:05:07 I was kind of naysaying this guy because the way he made his case especially in his first one against them
01:05:12 Sounded just like a stupid fucking comment of like oh cinema sins is misleading the audience misinforming them about to the movies
01:05:21 It's just so inaccurate the videos are inaccurate and it's just blue and like he had a really respectful tone
01:05:26 I was like under tailoring him up there for comedic effect
01:05:29 But it was just I was imagining the transcript of this guy's video pissing me off
01:05:34 Especially if I liked cinema sins or if it was like a video that I made right, but I have to admit
01:05:40 This is an instance where the amount of actually being factually wrong reaches a critical mass of okay
01:05:47 Yeah, your videos suck right cuz like commenters love to do that. Oh you got this point wrong
01:05:51 You got that point wrong there for you're invalid and it's like fuck you
01:05:55 But like this like he this guy over the course of several videos, especially the one on the Marvel movies
01:06:01 Convinced to me that cinema sins are shitty not just that like making videos or analyzing them
01:06:08 But even watching movies and paying adequate attention
01:06:11 I am convinced that cinema sins are not just doing cynical YouTube clickbait
01:06:16 You know shit to like get the views but are also just outright lazy in general right because I remember at least last time
01:06:22 I checked cinema sins uploads once every three days right that and but and yet I think he does two movies a week
01:06:28 Yeah, something like that right
01:06:29 Let's just say once every three days right and like this guy convinced me that they only watch the movies once maybe twice
01:06:36 And are probably taking down notes as they're going through without pausing by the sheer level of like fucking up that their points have
01:06:43 But when I explained to my friend yeah three days is a lot
01:06:46 But three days is enough time to watch the movie raw not taking down any notes
01:06:51 Take down some notes after watching it watch the movie again
01:06:54 Taking down notes while you watch it and then watch the movie a third time to make sure you didn't fuck anything up
01:06:59 Right you can do all that in one day if it's a full-time job second day
01:07:02 Edit the video make the whole fucking video and then have your lunch break because it should only take like three hours tops
01:07:08 Right then you could take the rest of the day and the whole third day just doing whatever right so clearly shit channel
01:07:14 And it's like it's just one channel that has been objectively proven as shit by another channel
01:07:19 Extensively analyzing them. So uh, yeah, fuck cinema sins. I have a video game where you beat them up. It's it
01:07:25 It's it's really it's really like
01:07:28 Telling when you when you realize, you know, most people don't have a very good work ethic and
01:07:34 They still manage to get videos out so quickly because they're they're just not that they're not using their brain that much
01:07:42 Yeah, it's just
01:07:45 When I when I when I feel like I have to work a lot harder than other people to get things out faster
01:07:50 And I realized that they're not working hard themselves
01:07:53 Yeah, so guys if you want a visible hand at work if you guys want to beat the shit out of cinema sins
01:07:58 I have a flash game for it. Just Google footwear man beats up cinema sins
01:08:02 I made a long time ago. Just add Jesse's request. So there you go
01:08:07 The other thing I hate about cinema sins is that they've spawned so many imitators. Oh god. Oh, no if you want a
01:08:14 Oh, do you remember the bro? There's multiple brony ones early, sir. Oh, right?
01:08:18 Cinema
01:08:21 No, if you want objective fucking proof that your video style is easy
01:08:25 There is one channel I saw that's like literally an 11 year old girl doing it for every episode of sonic boom
01:08:32 It's great
01:08:36 Yeah, I actually like the idea
01:08:41 The point stands though, it's it's a very easy formula to ape
01:08:45 But yeah, that's the only I mean that was kind of long for a lightning round thing
01:08:49 We think I was just gonna say two things off the bat that I always hated that I don't even pay attention to much anymore
01:08:54 The channels where it's just like a girl with big tits
01:08:56 They're like being pushed up with a broad just staring at the camera and that's it
01:08:59 They get a million views and get tons of money. I hate them. Oh, yeah, like Ben and Jackie's College fund
01:09:06 Yeah, that's pretty much
01:09:10 Hate that hate Ben clearly
01:09:15 Haven't watched it yet, but if that's what it is then
01:09:21 Then the other thing is just reaction channels in general, they're all terrible like Ben and Jackie's College Fund. Yeah, we're pretty
01:09:30 We're pretty much guilty of everything
01:09:36 Yeah, that's all I got anybody else have any closing remarks quickly before we go to questions because
01:09:40 Where we're we're pushing an hour here. I don't like people who do twitch and
01:09:48 Are really in board and they get hundreds hundreds of billions of
01:09:54 Currency
01:09:57 Every five seconds is like oh
01:10:00 Some guy gave you a hundred bucks. Well, yeah, thanks. I'm just gonna keep
01:10:05 Which is a platform I don't like like there's nothing on twitch. I enjoy it's all bad
01:10:10 Especially I don't make tons of money. I don't understand the drive
01:10:14 To watch to watch someone play like Hearthstone or League of Legends or something and be like, yeah
01:10:19 I just I just don't get the idea of watching video games. I've tried
01:10:23 I've really tried to get into it and like if you do good on you, but I just I don't get it
01:10:27 I'm just when I watch because I only want to watch people playing games that I I like or I want to play and the whole time
01:10:33 Just like I kind of want to just play the game now and then I just turn it off and I'll go play the game
01:10:37 So, yeah, I don't I don't really get it. I mean
01:10:40 Everything has its audience at market blah blah blah, but yeah, not my thing
01:10:44 Okay, we're going to questions. All right. Good. Yeah, let's go
01:10:47 question from the
01:10:49 PCP patron lounge if you want to get to this exclusive lounge while where we all hang out and chat with you fucking sheeple
01:10:56 Go over to the PCP patreon and throw in a buck. You'll get access. You can ask us these questions
01:11:01 You can I think I think did you posted pictures of his pfimosis cock in here the other day?
01:11:05 So if you want to get on that go ahead
01:11:08 Does that count as false advertising if I just like give out a blatant lie and then say give us money?
01:11:14 No, it's because it's true because it's I can see them right now
01:11:24 Okay, here's a question from
01:11:26 Cucked by the laws of aerodynamics who wants to know if you could get any movie sequel made. What would it be? Oh
01:11:33 God
01:11:38 The brave little toaster for oh shit I
01:11:42 Love brave little toaster even though the two and three were made by Disney and they weren't as good as the first one
01:11:47 I want them. I want more toaster. No, I I actually have a great answer to this
01:11:53 Okay, um, I don't know if anyone's ever heard of
01:11:57 Fucking Rhapsody Street kids believe in Santa is a
01:12:02 Abominable Christmas special. Yeah, we reviewed it on the college fund
01:12:05 Yeah, and it it was supposed to have a sequel like the end of it ends with like will be back for Easter
01:12:11 But it was so bad and and was received so terribly that it never got made and there's nothing
01:12:16 I would rather see in this world than Rhapsody Street kids to Easter Easter Feaster or whatever
01:12:23 Oh
01:12:24 Yeah, so that's my pig. I'm gonna cheat because it's what I do and instead of a sequel
01:12:29 I want a prequel because I want to see more movies in the inception universe
01:12:33 But I don't want to see a sequel because that'll ruin the ambiguous ending of the first one
01:12:37 But I want to see more adventures of you know, Leo and friends going into people's dreams and fucking around
01:12:42 I think that'd be a lot of fun. I
01:12:45 Know Leo young Leo meets young. Yeah
01:12:50 Incept young Sheldon to convince him to be an atheist
01:12:55 It's where he learned his it's inception. We you find out that young
01:13:00 To his brain young young Sheldon events of the dream the dream die of technology. Oh my god
01:13:08 By accident well, we did it we we came up with the perfect movie
01:13:12 Honey, honey, I incepted
01:13:23 The time what movie do you want to see the suicide diaries to?
01:13:31 Yeah, totally that's I'm gonna make it myself. Just you wait one of these days
01:13:37 Oh
01:13:39 God
01:13:40 Nothing nothing's really spring to mind to be totally honest
01:13:45 Yeah, I'm there's no nine eleven two. Oh, oh that's coming to at the rate. We're going. Let's be real
01:13:52 What the Trump Tower?
01:13:54 Maybe
01:13:57 Man imagine just imagine not saying I want it to happen
01:14:06 Maybe
01:14:10 I
01:14:15 Was making the veil threat the Trump
01:14:26 We're gonna blow up Trump Tower good on you ISIS the heroes we deserve they did it
01:14:33 Okay, well great question monkey. Let's move on to the next one I guess unless the view had an answer
01:14:38 Yeah, I was thinking about it because I was thinking thinking of every movie
01:14:41 I like and like I don't want sequels to any of them
01:14:43 You know I'm it's down on the whole sequels remakes reboots read everything is that anyone is your name too
01:14:48 What was their name?
01:14:50 Well, but no, um, so I was thinking well, you know, I don't like the idea in general
01:14:54 So how can I turn it? How can I spin it into a win?
01:14:57 Right and I had the idea a while ago that like Hollywood should just read everything all at once in one giant thing
01:15:04 And then like kill everyone so I had like how can you do that?
01:15:07 Well, I'd also being the ultimate showdown
01:15:10 Revengeance and just make it like all the actual fucking people not just flat shitty flash animations full score by lemon demon
01:15:17 Of course who has lately gotten really good at combining fucking music together deal Cesariga that guy
01:15:23 So like just yeah, he just come good at that for yeah
01:15:26 He fucking he fucking like smashes every fucking movie soundtrack into one
01:15:30 We're using his incredible skills and like all the actors are brought back for a final movie and they all get slaughtered and
01:15:37 There we go
01:15:38 We can finally have new IPs because I'm as big on we need new IPs as anybody because IP every day
01:15:46 Fantastic um
01:15:49 All right, anybody else have a question
01:15:51 I'm looking through the chat most of them. Well, here's what here's what I don't know
01:15:56 There's one from me at you underscore flame
01:15:58 Why does digi insist on shaking his gross phymosis cock even people with regular foreskin have to wipe their dig?
01:16:05 Find out on the PCP patreon where did you posted several photos and this is not false advertising? I
01:16:14 Think it's just because
01:16:16 There's another question in there about like how has having girlfriends improved our hygiene and I have to imagine digi's toilet is no
01:16:23 Longer a giant piss-stained mess, but I don't know. I have not seen images of that. Can anybody confirm I?
01:16:29 Have not been there. No, I have not I can answer the question on the procrastinators fan chat
01:16:37 Yes, but not directly so so like I actually do take showers almost every day now
01:16:42 But like I mean my girlfriend does not but like what it is is that just like you know having a fucking relationship and sex just
01:16:48 Sort of balances out my fucking brain and I can make better decisions for myself like oh
01:16:53 Hey, if I take a shower
01:16:54 I will immediately like get that 15 minutes of time back by like how much faster I'm gonna work for the next couple hours
01:17:00 Cuz I'm gonna feel so fucking clean. I'm gonna feel awesome. So yes indirectly, but it's I
01:17:06 Still do and have always had better hygiene than my partner in question
01:17:19 Well, there you go all right whose girlfriend it I guess is disgusting
01:17:24 Every other day it's normal. Oh, yeah, that's fine
01:17:28 What about you Ben?
01:17:30 marginally
01:17:31 marginally
01:17:32 Just not as beard. I
01:17:35 Probably brush my teeth a little more often nowadays, you know to be polite
01:17:41 So that's pretty good, but everything else is pretty much the same
01:17:44 Yep
01:17:46 That's my answer. Do we have any other Twitter questions today? I want my questions Leo J. Larkin ask
01:17:52 Is there a literary device that makes you immediately stop caring about a story personally chosen one slash prophecy?
01:17:59 Oh question
01:18:01 That that's my big one for sure
01:18:03 I feel it's just so tired and played out that I
01:18:07 Almost like I almost want someone to put a spin on it that makes it interesting again
01:18:11 Because I feel like everyone who does it does it exactly the same
01:18:15 Hmm. I I did I did mention earlier the bit about like like breaking the fourth wall
01:18:20 If you break the fourth wall too much it makes me stop caring if you break the fourth wall so much that it's like
01:18:24 This isn't even a real story anymore, but Ben Deadpool likes Jimmy Changus, dude
01:18:30 That's that's that's in can okay
01:18:32 Well to answer the question
01:18:33 I mean the first thing that springs to mind it mind is like
01:18:36 When the narrative device of that like lets me know immediately that there's gonna be a big dramatic people getting mad at each other
01:18:42 Seen over a misunderstanding or the liar
01:18:44 But I thought that I was really unique with that whole point about the liar revealed until
01:18:49 Nostalgia Critic coined to the term and started talking about it a lot and so that's that that whole crusade
01:18:54 I guess is basically covered like we're learning our lesson from that fucking one hopefully
01:18:58 But to go really really broad like the biggest connecting fiber between my disengagement with most stories
01:19:03 But mostly most movies is when the goal isn't clear when like the point or like the objective or like how the characters gonna go about their
01:19:11 Objective isn't clear regardless of whether or not it's an action movie like I got to save the president or a romance movie
01:19:16 Like I got to get that girl to like me, you know, it's just whenever the
01:19:20 It's just the movie is not telling me exactly what the point or what the goal is
01:19:23 I just get so fucking confused and it's such a common thing with like Hollywood movies
01:19:28 Like I remember Star Wars episode 7 having this where it's like, okay
01:19:30 We kind of have to go here, but we kind of have to go there
01:19:32 But we're kind of gonna do this, but we're they were kind of not I die
01:19:36 I remember the Hobbit movies having the same problem
01:19:38 I couldn't quite like get like why everyone is doing the thing that you're doing. I'm done
01:19:42 You need you need to establish your stakes like very clearly because that's like the linchpin of getting people to actually give a fuck
01:19:48 Right, you don't do that the whole everything else just doesn't feel like it has any context
01:19:53 I also agree that like I think you basically just to this one. We're gonna reiterate it is that any any fake character like
01:20:01 Protagonist versus protagonist conflict that you know is going to be solved. It just feels like I'm I
01:20:07 Instantly get like really stressed out because I'm like this whole conflict is completely pointless
01:20:11 It's not gonna affect anything like they're not gonna keep fighting forever
01:20:15 Like so just can we just I have like that. I'll just flip through the pages and skim it until it gets over with
01:20:20 Yeah, I have a VH. I have a VHS tape. That's like pause
01:20:24 That's like stuck right before that scene happens the rocketeer, right?
01:20:28 I watched the handful of years ago or I almost did but then like I knew that basically I could tell based on like everything
01:20:33 Red flags were were blaring out of the screen up my ass like there's gonna be a scene where the guy
01:20:39 Can like meets the girlfriend and she's mad at him and she's probably gonna slap him and a little bit
01:20:43 Like rocketeer juice is gonna come out of his rocket ass or something
01:20:46 I just know it right and like like based on what how the scene was being framed. He was like he got off his rocket
01:20:51 He's walking into a building where the girlfriend is and I know all the plot beats that are happening
01:20:55 So I'm like, yeah, there's gonna be a scene where she's mad at him and he's at his lowest point
01:20:58 And I was so mad preemptively I was so preemptively mad
01:21:01 Knowing it was gonna happen and bring down my entire opinion of the otherwise perfectly okay movie that I was watching
01:21:07 So I I paused the movie stopped it took took out the tape and I have not gotten back to it for years until this day
01:21:12 It stays exactly at that point and I'm just ready ready with a fucking shotgun
01:21:19 Everybody likes to suck the dick of the new it movie
01:21:21 But even that like for no reason the kids all
01:21:25 Stopping in friends and then like not even two minutes later. It's resolved like
01:21:29 Hornet into every fucking movie. It's so
01:21:34 Much I'd much rather they do it that way where it's like something it's just done
01:21:38 Just don't do it at all. I agree. But if you're going to do it quickly
01:21:42 What does it fucking add? I don't I don't know it's very I mean for me
01:21:46 It's not even the for me
01:21:48 I don't even get as mad about like the forciveness of it as the I can't believe the characters would act
01:21:53 I guess it's related to the forciveness
01:21:55 But it's always stupidity on the part of the main character right like I remember hearing that there's like
01:21:59 What's that one movie about the fucking lizard iguana guy who can camouflage and therefore he lies and like that has a liar revealed
01:22:05 Seen in it. I haven't seen it
01:22:06 But Nostalgia Critics said that it's an example of a movie that works because that Rango Rango
01:22:10 Um, I won't say like Django Unchained, but that's not the right movie. So anyway, he was saying like that movie it works
01:22:16 Because the movie is fucking about that
01:22:20 It's like a movie about a character who's like thing is that he's deceptive and he has to learn his lesson about it
01:22:25 And I'm like, there you go, right?
01:22:27 I hate it when it's like a character who I'm supposed to like relate to or has any sort of arrangement of personality
01:22:33 Things or things going on with them and they always somehow find themselves in a place where they're incentivized to lie about themselves
01:22:39 And they always go about lying about themselves in the same fucking way or they fail to communicate in a certain way for me
01:22:44 I never fucking put up with people misunderstanding me. I'm gonna push
01:22:48 I'm gonna put them down in the seat get out the fucking whiteboard if I have to and visualize like a fucking
01:22:53 Chalkboard youtube video why they're wrong and misunderstanding something to the point that they're exhausted and don't give a shit anymore
01:22:59 That's how all of my liar revealed scenes go all of my misunderstanding scenes go it goes with them saying I don't care anymore
01:23:05 Fine shut the fuck up. I just I'm so taken out of it by the fact that like when the character gets the misunderstanding happening
01:23:12 They just sort of sit there and like sigh and let the girl character slap them in the face
01:23:17 You know, I'm just like why don't they like why can't there just be one character just beat that one?
01:23:21 Yeah, just one character who's like shut up. No, I remember there's like one movie
01:23:25 That's like a fucking child above who gets framed for being a terrorist and he literally says
01:23:29 I would be the stupidest terrorist in the world if I did this that and the other this doesn't make any sense
01:23:33 He actually stands up for himself and I'm like that eagle eye eagle eye. He stands up for himself
01:23:36 And I was so fucking good at this baby. You are yeah, I was so fucking relieved that he finally like said something for himself
01:23:42 That's the for me. It's not the forciveness the obligation is as much as the character sitting there and taking it up the ass
01:23:48 It I can't relate to that at all and uh, yeah, I hate it
01:23:53 It's every episode of friends. Oh really
01:23:56 You know what? I want I want to maybe I also ties into like oh, we don't believe you like if there's like a
01:24:01 Supernatural thing happening and like the main character does a terrible job explaining it, you know
01:24:06 And so therefore no one believes it
01:24:07 I want to have a thing that has the misunderstanding and the no one believes you thing
01:24:11 And like it causes his life to be ruined
01:24:14 But then like people finally find out, you know through the plot that it actually was real all the time and they like
01:24:18 Have a little cell and they all killed themselves. No, no, he kills them. So they have a celebration about it
01:24:24 Right. Yes. Yeah, they have a cell. I want that. No, no, no, literally. It's like this
01:24:28 It's like it's going to be like, okay
01:24:30 You know like from dusk till dawn which has like a horror movie twist halfway through this is going to be a like
01:24:35 Does that this is going to be like a horror a horror movie twist that happens in the last scene, right?
01:24:38 It's otherwise a normal family movie or some shit with a mysterious r-rating
01:24:42 I guess where like, you know, he like just sort of takes it, you know
01:24:46 There's a couple of signs early on and throughout the movie that he might be psychotic
01:24:49 But otherwise he acts like a perfectly normal fucking 80s protagonist
01:24:52 Just sort of taking this fucking bullshit from all these people who don't like understand him for no fault of his own
01:24:57 And then at the end they have a little party or a little festival
01:24:59 They're like, yeah, we're really sorry about that
01:25:01 You know once the plot revealed to us that you were right all and then he just like he gets up to make his speech
01:25:05 But he pulls out a fucking uzi and just fucking slaughters them and you like see individual characters
01:25:11 Like the older mom character from some other family who like set a particularly nasty line to him
01:25:16 You see him stab her with a fork until her neck borderline comes off
01:25:19 But he gives up and moves on to someone else, you know, that's what I fucking want as a movie
01:25:24 Well, you know, your life's work is ahead. You know what you have to do
01:25:29 It's time to get to the real life story
01:25:32 Be the change be the change
01:25:34 I remember I remember like happens in like Home Alone 3 and I'm like yelling at the characters like don't be nice to him
01:25:38 Now you remember the fucking I want you dead. They you should die you y'all should die and my dad was like what?
01:25:44 Jesus calm down
01:25:46 Like I want them dead
01:25:49 Wait, you were saying that stuff out loud. What was in front of your family? I wasn't saying fuck
01:25:53 I was just saying like casually like I hate those characters. They should die. I was just casually saying
01:25:57 I want them to die
01:26:00 My dad was so offended on behalf of my threatening of the murder of these fictional characters
01:26:05 Well, Home Alone 3 is a lively event at the Davoo household. Yeah, this was like 15 years ago
01:26:11 It's a family tradition. Oh, I remember I remember at rad con 2 you were telling us all about Home Alone 3
01:26:16 I was
