00:00:30 Hello everyone, and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:46 We are delighted to have you back once again with all my best friends, except for Ben,
00:00:52 because he's fucking farting up a storm over there.
00:00:54 Gay.
00:00:55 What do you have to say for yourself, Ben?
00:00:56 I think that money is gay, and I hate you.
00:01:00 Understand.
00:01:01 Digi is here.
00:01:02 Yeah.
00:01:03 As is Geoff.
00:01:04 Yeah, that's me.
00:01:05 In his mom's courthouse.
00:01:08 Geoff returning for the first time in like months.
00:01:10 Oh man, true.
00:01:11 That's right, actually.
00:01:12 I've been busy.
00:01:13 What a cloud has been cast over this lovely podcast of ours.
00:01:19 What's the last time influences?
00:01:21 Uh...
00:01:22 Geez, really?
00:01:23 Maybe.
00:01:24 That was a long time ago.
00:01:25 That was his first one, so that would mean he was only on one.
00:01:28 No, no.
00:01:29 I've been on a couple.
00:01:30 I think the last one I was on was Selling Out, which is perfect for this.
00:01:34 And our friend, Endless Jazz, is here.
00:01:37 That's right.
00:01:38 Now I want to give a big shout out, a big thank you to me for that brilliant job I did
00:01:42 putting together The Plebe and the Weeb, the greatest two guys talking about shows
00:01:47 and drinking beer show in the history of YouTube.
00:01:50 The definitive one, the only one that's ever existed.
00:01:53 I invented it.
00:01:54 I made it.
00:01:55 And I made it so goddamn good that I'm now a millionaire.
00:01:59 So thank you.
00:02:00 And that's what we're here to talk about today.
00:02:01 Thank you, Endless Jazz.
00:02:02 Thank you, and you're welcome.
00:02:03 And you're welcome to Endless Jazz.
00:02:04 Yes.
00:02:05 Thank you.
00:02:06 We all are thankful.
00:02:07 And the topic of today's podcast is crowdfunding.
00:02:11 And by the way, there just so happens to be an urban dictionary definition of crowdfunding
00:02:16 that I pulled up ahead of time.
00:02:17 All right, so here we go.
00:02:19 Crowdfunding.
00:02:20 The number one definition.
00:02:21 I love that this show is urban.
00:02:23 I love that we keep it straight in this podcast.
00:02:25 Yeah, we really do.
00:02:27 Yes.
00:02:28 All right, so our definition that we'll be using and not deviating from the slightest
00:02:31 is crowdfunding.
00:02:34 Hipster slash tech speak translated to quote, begging for money over the internet.
00:02:39 And that's exactly what it is.
00:02:41 That's what I would have said.
00:02:47 Hashtag soliciting, hashtag begging.
00:02:49 A noble calling only for the bravest of champions.
00:02:53 And we've got a few of them.
00:02:54 In fact, every single one of us.
00:02:56 Every single person on this podcast is a crowdfunding millionaire.
00:03:03 In fact, one person on this podcast is a crowdfunding website, patreon.com slash bensane.
00:03:09 That's right.
00:03:10 That's right.
00:03:11 I invented the market and then cornered it.
00:03:16 Turning every dream into a plan and then fulfilling it.
00:03:19 So I mean, everyone listening, everyone listening probably already knows what crowdfunding is.
00:03:25 And if not, there's an easy way for you to learn is to go to patreon.com slash your best
00:03:29 guy ever.
00:03:30 Or patreon.com slash a million dollars.
00:03:33 And it's already disgusting.
00:03:35 This is already a disgusting podcast.
00:03:37 I agree.
00:03:38 The people love it.
00:03:39 The people love it.
00:03:40 All right.
00:03:41 This is what money does to people.
00:03:42 This is what money does to people.
00:03:43 And that's why you can't be implicit in the system.
00:03:45 You got to rage.
00:03:46 Rage against the garbage.
00:03:47 This is coming from the wall.
00:03:48 I want to hear that from you, Ben.
00:03:50 From patreon.com slash bensane.
00:03:51 You ruined Corona's life with all that hot Nuzlocke money.
00:03:55 You ruined his life.
00:03:56 You made him a wreck of a man.
00:03:58 He's depressed.
00:03:59 He won't come out of the toilet.
00:04:01 I think it's a transitional phase he's in.
00:04:04 I think he's going to come out of it stronger.
00:04:06 Oh, I hope so.
00:04:07 I mean, I hope so too.
00:04:08 Did you, you were saying something of substance, I think?
00:04:11 Yeah.
00:04:12 Please continue.
00:04:13 This isn't the podcast for that.
00:04:16 Get the fuck out of here.
00:04:17 I want the biggest, greenest arrow with the biggest implying in all caps right next to
00:04:23 that statement.
00:04:24 Yeah.
00:04:25 But, yeah, no, Ben, patreon.com slash bensane here, who's just coming off the heels of a
00:04:31 very successful Indiegogo campaign.
00:04:33 It was GoFundMe, but yeah, same thing.
00:04:37 To fund a computer that you built and as well as a 3DS with a capture card so that you
00:04:44 could do a Nuzlocke.
00:04:47 But yeah, Ben's computer is almost done.
00:04:50 His squat racks finally finished unrelated.
00:04:52 That was a crowdfung.
00:04:54 Yeah, so I should just say about the GoFundMe that, like, I mean, I saw Monkey had done
00:05:02 a GoFundMe for a capture card and I was kind of inspired by him and I went and I did mine
00:05:07 for my computer that I really needed a new one, but I couldn't afford one.
00:05:12 I feel a little bit like Monkey has become the new drowning in footwear and that he's
00:05:18 the guy that everyone's like, oh, remember what that guy did?
00:05:20 He's so awesome.
00:05:21 He's so cool.
00:05:22 I want to do things like that guy.
00:05:24 Well, no, maybe.
00:05:25 I guess.
00:05:26 I agree.
00:05:27 Monkey is an inspiration.
00:05:28 I love you, though, Monkey.
00:05:29 A scholar.
00:05:30 Well, yeah.
00:05:31 So we're also coming on, this is literally, we're at the very end of day one of a 30-day
00:05:38 Kickstarter that I've launched with Mr. Endless Jess in order to fund-
00:05:43 He says launched with me, but I had no idea this was happening.
00:05:47 Yeah.
00:05:48 No.
00:05:49 I just woke up a millionaire.
00:05:50 That's the end of the story.
00:05:52 You know, kids, if you follow your dreams, someday you'll wake up and one of your friends
00:05:56 will have made you a millionaire.
00:05:59 You knew before you went to bed that this was going to- that a Kickstarter was in the
00:06:04 worst.
00:06:05 Yeah.
00:06:06 Well, like, we had been talking about it.
00:06:07 Yeah, we should do a Kickstarter and all this.
00:06:09 And I'm like, yeah, okay, sure, whatever.
00:06:10 Because like, my general philosophy with all things in life is that eventually someone
00:06:16 will do it for me.
00:06:18 And once again, I was proven right because I was like, yeah, sure, it's Kickstarter,
00:06:21 whatever, sounds great.
00:06:22 So then I wake up today.
00:06:23 I wake up in my bed surrounded by all my women.
00:06:27 I've got all these women here.
00:06:29 You know, it's like in the Feel Good, Inc. video when Murdoch wakes up and he's got
00:06:33 all those babes around him, all those, all those fine sluts.
00:06:37 You've got Asuka, you've got fucking-
00:06:39 Yeah.
00:06:40 And I go over-
00:06:41 I was so turned on by that highly problematic scene.
00:06:44 And I go over and I look out the window and off in the clouds I see Digi on a windmill
00:06:49 playing guitar with a fucking kickstarter behind him bringing all this money into my castle.
00:06:56 Wait, no, this metaphor doesn't end well, that's when the windmill gets shot down.
00:07:01 And then I just picture off on the side, Colt Corona just walking and singing, Patreon,
00:07:06 Patreon, Patreon, kickstarter for me.
00:07:12 I can, whatever, things, things related to that song.
00:07:17 Yeah.
00:07:18 That's as creative as Colt Corona could probably have been about that.
00:07:21 Yes, I was in character.
00:07:22 I'm sure there's some line in there about his giant dong or some shit.
00:07:26 He tends to shoehorn that in wherever he can.
00:07:29 He really does.
00:07:30 But don't be fooled, people.
00:07:33 There's still such a void in Jesse's empty soul that could only be filled by more money.
00:07:38 It's true.
00:07:39 Don't give up.
00:07:40 And if you toss in even more money, you'll be able to see even more cool people in videos
00:07:50 with Digi.
00:07:51 Yes, you'll get to see Hippo and Nate, cool people.
00:07:55 And also, Jeff might show up.
00:07:57 Maybe.
00:07:58 I'm not a cool person.
00:08:00 I'm just advocating for the rest of them.
00:08:02 Do we have a, is there a numerical goal for that tier?
00:08:06 Yeah, it's a 5,000 for you and Hippo and then another 400 for Jeff.
00:08:10 All right, there you go, folks.
00:08:12 So yeah.
00:08:14 And after that, all the money will just go into Jesse's pocket, essentially, because
00:08:18 he's adding this thing and it's mostly his work.
00:08:21 And I can assure everyone it'll be spent wisely.
00:08:26 And we're talking about 26 episodes at this point, right?
00:08:30 That's correct.
00:08:31 20 episodes.
00:08:32 They're not going to be all filmed at once.
00:08:33 It's going to be like, you know, we're going to do season one and then like six months
00:08:38 later we'll just fly Jesse down again with the remainder of the money.
00:08:41 Because like, Jesse doesn't, I'm sure, does not want to have to edit 20 fucking episodes
00:08:46 of this at once.
00:08:47 Yeah.
00:08:48 Or for his wife.
00:08:49 Even three nearly killed the man.
00:08:50 Yeah.
00:08:51 I don't think he wants his life to be filmed.
00:08:52 You know what this reminds me of, actually?
00:08:53 I was watching the DVD commentary of Seinfeld of the early episodes, at least I think with
00:08:58 the DVD commentary.
00:08:59 It might have been an interview.
00:09:00 But they were talking about the process through which Larry David had to write the scripts
00:09:05 for the show and he was talking about at first there was a pilot and he immediately wanted
00:09:09 to kill himself, that he had to write a pilot.
00:09:12 It was already done.
00:09:13 But then the show got picked up and he had to make like a four episode season, season
00:09:17 like zero, season one.
00:09:19 And he also at that point he knew there was no, there was no saving him.
00:09:22 He had to die, but he somehow got it done.
00:09:25 And then it came time to write like a 26 episode season and at that point every shred of the
00:09:30 man had been eroded away.
00:09:31 There was only a husk where love and trust had once been.
00:09:35 And that's how we get the Larry David of today.
00:09:37 And that's how we get the movie.
00:09:38 And I just imagine the same thing happening to Jesse.
00:09:39 Yeah, that's right.
00:09:42 Jerry, Jerry by the way, was fine.
00:09:43 Jerry, he didn't really write as much as Larry, so let's see his personality that just let
00:09:48 things roll.
00:09:49 Anyway, who cares about fucking Seinfeld?
00:09:50 I don't know.
00:09:51 I care about Seinfeld.
00:09:52 He's a bee.
00:09:53 Yeah, fuck him.
00:09:54 Yeah, fuck that guy.
00:09:55 Nice, he's cool.
00:09:56 He is a bee after all.
00:09:57 So, so in addition to these Kickstarter and other campaigns thing, we all, every single
00:10:10 one of us has a Patreon that run in slightly different ways, but in general they are sources
00:10:15 of funding that allow us to do the stuff we're doing.
00:10:18 And by the way, the rest of us all can entirely subsist off of our Patreon.
00:10:23 That's exactly what I was going to say.
00:10:25 And add money.
00:10:26 And add money.
00:10:27 That's true.
00:10:28 Right, yeah.
00:10:29 Oh, look at these guys with their add money.
00:10:30 Well, actually, I mean, I make like, I'm making a substantial amount of cash this month
00:10:36 from just shelling for various companies.
00:10:40 Oh, right.
00:10:41 That's true.
00:10:42 Which is something we should all get into in a good way.
00:10:44 Not crowdfunding.
00:10:45 Yeah, that's true.
00:10:46 That is not crowdfunding, it's not part of the conversation.
00:10:49 When I get my ad revenue checked from YouTube every six months or in the mail for a fucking
00:10:56 like $10, it feels like I got the golden ticket.
00:10:59 It's such a rare occurrence.
00:11:01 It's like when they had the jury in Clerk's The Animated Series and it's like, well, they
00:11:06 gave us $5 for breakfast today.
00:11:08 I hope this trial never ends.
00:11:10 That's how I feel when I get my fucking yearly $2 of ad revenue.
00:11:15 It gets lower every time I mention it.
00:11:17 Yeah.
00:11:18 If we ever get paid for T-Batben, I don't know if we did.
00:11:21 We got like, I want to say $130 at one point.
00:11:24 Yeah, we got like slightly over $100 for like well over a million views.
00:11:28 We got well over a million views, like $100 and that was it.
00:11:31 So thanks, YouTube.
00:11:32 You're the best.
00:11:33 Yeah, no, ad revenue is so unreliable that like, I don't check it at all.
00:11:38 I never look at what I'm making, like maybe once a month, I'll take a glance just to see
00:11:42 if I'm like, you know, doing better or worse than the previous month, but I plan all of
00:11:47 my finances just around Patreon so that every time YouTube money does show up, it's a huge
00:11:51 surprise.
00:11:52 And it's like, oh my God, I'm rich.
00:11:53 I have all the sex money.
00:11:54 Let's talk about like the $10,000 or so that YouTube owes me for my fucking Bats video
00:12:00 that they siphoned all the aggregate wall that got like 10 billion views and I've never
00:12:05 seen a penny from it.
00:12:06 Inexplicably.
00:12:07 Well, yeah, yeah, that's that's that shit Craig.
00:12:10 But you know, I was going to say, it's really interesting to me that shit Craig got.
00:12:13 That just about sums it up, guys.
00:12:16 It's really interesting to me.
00:12:17 You know how this thing happened recently where like videos were getting demonetized
00:12:22 and everyone was freaking out because like, oh, all the YouTube guys are going to go under.
00:12:26 But like, it's interesting that pretty much all of us are talking like our primary source
00:12:31 of income, at least for you, Digi, of the primary source of income is Patreon.
00:12:35 So like, you're not even really depending on the ad revenue that is sort of being pulled
00:12:39 from some people, whereas other creators are like freaking out because it is.
00:12:43 Patreon has definitely changed the model.
00:12:44 It's changed the game.
00:12:45 And for two reasons, and this will get into some of the deeper stuff, like on the one
00:12:49 hand, it's just that ad revenue is so, so unreliable.
00:12:54 And also, I think a business model that's dying.
00:12:57 I think it's going out because ads on it, I've seen, you know, a bunch of studies basically
00:13:03 saying that ads on the internet aren't actually making anybody money.
00:13:07 Like everyone's assuming they should be making money.
00:13:09 Everyone thinks that it's like, you know, it sounds like a good idea on paper, but it's
00:13:13 not like, it's not nearly making back what it's being, what's being spent on it, you
00:13:17 know, like the, the, the paying for ad space is not having enough returns for the advertisers
00:13:23 in the first place.
00:13:24 So eventually advertising has to either transform or die, you know, it's, it's going in that
00:13:30 direction where people just have to really consider what they're actually trying to advertise
00:13:33 on YouTube, make sure it's super relevant to what people are, you know, watching.
00:13:37 And then, you know, some of the paid endorsements are a better way of doing that, which is why
00:13:41 those are getting popular and why guys like Jeff are, you know, doing some of the endorsement
00:13:45 deals, but, um, but beyond that, I mean, the thing is like paid endorsements, they're
00:13:52 fun, they're fun for everybody.
00:13:54 If you do them right, if you do them wrong, it's like, oh, hey, Rob Schneider's on Game
00:13:58 Grumps.
00:13:59 What? Yeah.
00:14:00 Was he, was that a, I mean, I don't think that was paid.
00:14:03 I don't think that was paid, but it like feels weird and uncomfortable.
00:14:07 It was a shitty episode.
00:14:08 I watched it and I don't really watch Game Grumps, did not enjoy it.
00:14:11 Yeah.
00:14:12 But like the point that I'm making is like, when you have, when you have fun with doing
00:14:17 a paid endorsement, it's like, it connects better with the audience because it's the
00:14:22 type of content that they're actually there for as opposed to something completely different
00:14:26 that's being tossed on.
00:14:27 Yeah.
00:14:28 Yeah. I mean, the reason I'm comfortable doing crunchy roll ads is because I legitimately
00:14:32 use crunchy roll.
00:14:33 I watched most of my anime on there because it's fucking convenient, you know, for me
00:14:38 because I, you know, live in the United States and don't have half the shows blocked.
00:14:42 But like, you know, I'm endorsing something I actually believe in.
00:14:47 And even then half of the time I do it as like a fake mock, you know, ad, like I'm usually
00:14:52 shitting on whatever show.
00:14:53 And then I'm like, oh, by the way, it's on crunchy roll.
00:14:55 If for some reason you want cancer, you know, and that works.
00:14:59 People really respond well to that.
00:15:01 And that's going to get me into why I believe so strongly in crowdfunding because I really
00:15:07 think it's the most respectable way to get money.
00:15:11 And like it's it's funny because I feel like most people feel the opposite.
00:15:14 And I did too.
00:15:15 When I first started, like I really didn't want to ask people for money.
00:15:18 I wanted it to be all through, you know, through ad revenue, because I was like,
00:15:23 that's so corporate and, you know, disconnected.
00:15:26 And it's like, you know, I'm just I'm just doing a job.
00:15:28 I'm just getting paid by the machine.
00:15:29 You know, that's how money should flow.
00:15:31 It should all be structured and stuff.
00:15:33 But like that is actually the opposite of how it should be.
00:15:38 It should be organic.
00:15:39 It should be people choosing exactly where their dollar goes and why it's going there,
00:15:44 you know, and I have to earn every single fucking dollar that I make.
00:15:48 It has to like for me to get paid, I have to impress people.
00:15:52 My work has to be something people want to see.
00:15:54 It can't be something advertisers want.
00:15:56 It can't be something that the mainstream media did just died.
00:16:00 No, he died and he took my Kickstarter money with him.
00:16:04 That's now that's a tragedy right there.
00:16:07 I was just giving an impassioned speech about fuck the fuck the advertisers.
00:16:11 But like, you know, it's just that, yeah, every single time someone pledges to me,
00:16:17 it's because they personally felt a connection to my content and wanted to support it,
00:16:21 you know, and like, and that's how I spend a lot of my money as well.
00:16:26 Is like, I I spend my money to vote with the dollar.
00:16:28 I don't really buy art for the sake of owning it.
00:16:31 I buy it for the sake of giving money to the people so that they know,
00:16:34 hey, someone out there appreciated your work enough to think that you should be
00:16:38 able to live off of it, you know.
00:16:40 Yeah. Yeah. And you know, it's interesting, you know,
00:16:43 however your personal feelings are about, you know,
00:16:45 like people having a patron or not, like even some artists do,
00:16:48 like Gibba was telling us the other day that what's his name?
00:16:51 Happy Harry cartoons, like the guy who makes that, he hates Patreon.
00:16:56 He like makes fun of people with patrons or something.
00:16:58 He hates Patreon. It makes fun.
00:16:59 Demolition D. There you go.
00:17:01 But why is it more?
00:17:02 Well, that's the thing. You have to think about trash, idiots, scum.
00:17:06 Well, all right, that's that's the thing, though.
00:17:07 Like you have to consider what are the alternatives and like what are the
00:17:11 what are the reasons for your belief and what are the alternatives?
00:17:14 If you don't like crowdfunding, then like theoretically,
00:17:16 you would think that their motivation is probably that they think that it's in
00:17:19 some way taking advantage of the fans' goodwill or something along those lines.
00:17:23 But I mean, does that argument really hold up because no one's forcing them to do it?
00:17:27 And I think a lot of it is a matter of there's so many people who have
00:17:31 and I'm just going to call it pretentiousness about like what deserves
00:17:36 to be paid for and what deserves to be considered art, you know?
00:17:39 Like there's there's there's still even among lots of critics and stuff,
00:17:43 there's still this mentality that anything that's derivative of another work
00:17:47 is lesser and not deserving of, you know, making money.
00:17:50 Like I hold that belief.
00:17:51 I hold that belief personally.
00:17:54 I mean, do you think that like that someone who draws like the shittiest
00:17:59 comic in the world should be getting paid more on Patreon than me?
00:18:03 Do you have a new personally advocated for
00:18:05 I mean, I mean, I mean, did you qualify with the shittiest
00:18:09 comment in the world and no, did you did you?
00:18:12 We already we already know that Ben thinks he should be paid more than you.
00:18:17 Well, that's true. That's true. I do believe.
00:18:20 But hey, wait a minute, Jeff, you fucker.
00:18:24 Jeff, the full implications of what you've said have sunk in
00:18:27 and I'm prepared to kill you for that.
00:18:29 That was a slow burn.
00:18:31 That was nice. That's that was a five alarm.
00:18:33 That's all right.
00:18:34 Samurai walks.
00:18:35 That's when the samurai slashes walks five steps.
00:18:37 Oh, yeah. She's the sword.
00:18:39 The blood. That was that was Thor.
00:18:41 That was Thor taking his eight steps or whatever
00:18:44 after he was bit by the by the Mjolnir serpents.
00:18:46 And yes, that's the five finger death punch.
00:18:49 But by the way, people,
00:18:51 if you want to see me be killed live on camera by Ben St.
00:18:56 Right.
00:18:57 Then you should get money to the plea of the lead Kickstarter.
00:19:00 Absolutely true.
00:19:02 Shilling Kickstarter that we are.
00:19:04 I my superpower is shilling literally just like
00:19:07 true. Get me to record myself for 20 minutes.
00:19:09 That can be a starter video.
00:19:11 I knew there was something special about you.
00:19:13 I knew there was that X factor that made you a winner.
00:19:16 I feel like you've done that.
00:19:17 To get back to what I was saying, like, right, you know,
00:19:20 I think there are some people who like really think that
00:19:23 if it's if it's original, regardless of the quality of it,
00:19:27 if it's original, it's more deserving.
00:19:29 Like Demolition D, you know, makes high quality YouTube videos
00:19:34 that some would say.
00:19:36 Some would. I used to make high quality YouTube videos.
00:19:40 He used to make videos at all.
00:19:41 But he used to make videos that that, you know, would be deserving
00:19:45 of, you know, making money from them, but he doesn't see it that way.
00:19:49 Meanwhile, he has this novella that he has on Amazon and he's selling it,
00:19:54 you know, because he sees it as this novella is my original work
00:19:59 that is worthy of being paid for, whereas my videos are not
00:20:03 because they're derivative, even though, you know, I mean,
00:20:06 I haven't read the novella, so I'm not going to say it's shittier than the videos.
00:20:08 But, you know, I think that's the mindset a lot of people have.
00:20:11 But that's not what the market is.
00:20:14 The market is people pay for what they want.
00:20:17 They want, you know, if people want derivative work, then it's, you know,
00:20:21 you might consider it unfortunate if that's not to your taste or whatever.
00:20:24 But again, I think that's pretentious.
00:20:26 The value of art lies solely with the people who place value in it.
00:20:30 And if people decide that something is worth their money,
00:20:32 then there's no fucking argument.
00:20:34 It is with their money because they decided to give their money.
00:20:36 And if you're going to sit there, you have to be you have to be a seriously
00:20:40 like arrogant egotistical twat to think that you're the sole arbiter
00:20:43 who gets to decide that something that someone made is not worth being paid for.
00:20:47 You know, you know, it's interesting because I think you guys are all
00:20:50 basically in agreement on that.
00:20:51 But I kind of I actually disagree with the part of that argument
00:20:54 because I've really racked my brain about what the usefulness
00:20:58 or like what the point of art is.
00:21:00 And the only answer that I was able to find was that it has like
00:21:04 that if a piece of art has a real world practical implications
00:21:07 about making the world a better place, that's the only way at the end of the day
00:21:11 that it has any value at all because art has a value in let's say
00:21:16 I get home from work and I want to kill myself.
00:21:19 And then I watch an episode of anime and now I don't want to kill myself.
00:21:22 That's that. Well, then that means that anime has done the world a disservice.
00:21:27 Let's be real. Yeah, that's true.
00:21:29 If you that was like, oh, man, another seven.
00:21:32 Jeff is all Jesus Christ.
00:21:35 That's what I'm here for.
00:21:36 Apparently, I bought today.
00:21:40 Oh, God.
00:21:42 Oh, brain dump is so good, though.
00:21:44 I was I was just going to say that I completely lost my point
00:21:48 after that savage blow from Jesus Christ.
00:21:51 It's all I've been I've been working.
00:21:53 I've been working at a shill video for the last like 30 hours straight
00:21:58 and and reediting and reediting is built up in your veins.
00:22:02 All that's going on in Jeff's brain is like, money, money, burns, money, burns,
00:22:08 burned the money.
00:22:09 I was something crossfire.
00:22:13 All the money's gone.
00:22:16 Right. I think I was going to say something along the lines of if you can do
00:22:20 sort of like, I mean, to expand from my point, if you can do like a social
00:22:23 experiment and determine whether or not there are like the the market forces
00:22:27 or just like the the the the social forces of like a given piece of art,
00:22:31 if they are trending towards a positive thing, like, you know, more people
00:22:35 are, I don't know, helping humanity in whatever factor that you can calculate.
00:22:39 Then it's a good thing if it is like making more people kill themselves
00:22:42 and making people unhappy.
00:22:43 That is how I would quantify a bad piece of art because it is causing bad things.
00:22:47 People kill themselves as opposed to there's got to be some amount of the
00:22:50 like unfathomable quantity that of people who like message everyone
00:22:55 who makes art and tells them, you saved me from depression.
00:22:58 You saved my life.
00:22:59 Wow. Your art has helped me to, you know, come to grips with the torturous
00:23:03 reality that is living, you know, that's the kind of messages I get all the time.
00:23:08 You know, that's great.
00:23:09 I mean, if if art does that, then that's obviously a positive influence.
00:23:12 But I'm just saying that this is my criteria.
00:23:15 This podcast has changed career trajectories for many fans who've written
00:23:20 in who have completely changed the way that they, you know, organize their lives
00:23:24 because of the advice we didn't go.
00:23:27 I had just today I read a letter from someone who was like trying to become
00:23:32 a scientist and then like she realized that, you know, my whole rant about
00:23:36 like how there's a difference between enjoying, you know, the idea of the thing
00:23:40 versus actually doing the thing.
00:23:41 And she's like, I realize I fucking hate doing science.
00:23:44 So, uh, oh, yeah, the world is descending into nothing but artists.
00:23:48 No one's going to do anything anymore because I want other people to do the science for me.
00:23:53 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no.
00:23:56 OK, OK. So it's slightly unfortunate that it happened to be a scientist doing
00:24:01 doing what you like. That only applies to us. OK.
00:24:04 That only applies to the people that are broadcasting this podcast.
00:24:07 Everybody else fucking make my sandwiches for me.
00:24:10 Please. Yeah, I would definitely rather have the science be done by people
00:24:15 who fucking love science than the people who, you know, are miserable
00:24:19 and just want to fucking get their damn paycheck and go home.
00:24:23 Let's let's get all the all the intellectuals on the Reddit board.
00:24:26 I fucking love science to do all our science for us. Perfect.
00:24:30 Is that a Reddit board? I thought that's a.
00:24:31 That's a real it's probably Facebook or whatever.
00:24:34 I don't keep up with the hip things going on with the kids with the Facebooks
00:24:37 and the tweet bots and the pictograms.
00:24:40 So I want to talk a little bit about how we've all had such fucking
00:24:45 successful crowdfunding campaigns, because I think there's there's sort
00:24:49 of a unifying factor with all of us, especially.
00:24:52 And like it's it's not that any of us have tried to like be
00:24:57 the the personality that gets this to work.
00:24:59 But like if you read all the advice given by Kickstarter and Patreon about
00:25:03 like what to do, it just happens to fit what we already are like,
00:25:06 which is to just be extremely honest and open about what like what you're
00:25:12 doing, what you're trying to do, what the money is for and like, you know,
00:25:15 how you feel about it.
00:25:17 And I think that honesty goes so far with people because like it's kind of
00:25:23 this whole model is kind of, you know, rejecting what I was just describing
00:25:26 of like the corporate ad culture where everything is so fake that
00:25:29 you literally know that, you know, that like everyone knows that ads are
00:25:33 a fake dolled up, gussied up version of just on Friday, by the way.
00:25:37 I mean, since I'm in the corporate world myself still, the like just on Friday,
00:25:42 we were having a meeting me and some of my coworkers and they were saying
00:25:45 that like no names, but like they had just nothing to do for the whole week.
00:25:49 And they were still getting a paycheck, but like that's the exact sort of
00:25:53 thing that would not be tolerated in a crowdfunding thing, you know, not delivering
00:25:58 your fans would fucking revolt on you as has happened plenty of times.
00:26:01 You know, and like that and just the the idea of ads.
00:26:07 There was a great super bunny hop just did a video about this, how like,
00:26:11 you know, in games nowadays, like there's they're trying to debate the legality
00:26:16 of whether like showing a blatant gameplay trailer, but styling it like
00:26:20 bullshots, legal bullshots, and like it's currently being considered legal
00:26:25 just because all advertising is like that.
00:26:28 So it's like what makes this we're used to being lied to.
00:26:31 So there's no crime here.
00:26:32 That's actually what the judge said.
00:26:33 Like people are used to being lied to.
00:26:35 So no reasonable consumer would assume that this was real.
00:26:39 You know, that means that you have to raise your children and teach them
00:26:42 you are going to be lied to all the time in life.
00:26:44 Like there's no avoiding it.
00:26:45 You have to do it according to the system.
00:26:47 And it's so when people see someone who's just like blatantly being honest,
00:26:52 then it's like it's such a refreshing thing to just be like, yeah,
00:26:56 I'm I'm giving my money to that guy.
00:26:58 And like, I think for for for us, especially, and I know this is certainly
00:27:03 true of me and Jesse, like, I think a lot of it also has to do with how loose
00:27:07 we are, that we never make like promises we can't keep.
00:27:10 We never try to make it sound better than it is, you know, like me or Jesse
00:27:14 will put out an update that's like, hey, I'm going to charge you guys for a
00:27:19 vlog. I need money, you know, and like, yeah, yeah, because like, I don't ever
00:27:24 want anyone to expect something other than what's the best I like, honestly
00:27:29 think I can give, you know, I don't want anyone to think I don't go out there
00:27:33 and I'm like, oh, man, if you guys give this much money, it's going to be so
00:27:36 much better than ever before.
00:27:37 That's why like all the reward tiers on the Kickstarter for pleave and the
00:27:40 weave were like goofy shit, you know, it was like, we'll buy more posters and
00:27:44 t-shirts because you're not going to make a better product than what we
00:27:48 already planned, you know, like that's not going to happen by throwing more
00:27:51 money at it. So just be completely real with people like, hey, here's how much
00:27:55 money it takes to just fly Jesse down here. We're going to make the show.
00:27:59 It's going to be just like the pilot, but with better visuals and audio because
00:28:02 we have the equipment working now. And if you give us more money, we're going
00:28:06 to spend it on, you know, shit to put in the show.
00:28:10 And I saw in the comments, people were like, they really were positive about
00:28:14 like, it is so great Digi that you were just like, if we're get over this
00:28:18 money, we're just going to buy t-shirts, posters and booze.
00:28:20 So, you know, give it your own risk.
00:28:23 So that was great.
00:28:24 I mean, really responded that.
00:28:25 That's a good thing to keep in mind for crowdfunding, right?
00:28:28 Like, I mean, everybody's biggest concern when they go into crowdfunding is,
00:28:33 oh, what if we don't make our funding goal, but drastically
00:28:37 outseeding your fund or exceeding your funding goal, outseeding.
00:28:40 What the fuck am I talking about drastically exceeding your funding goal
00:28:44 can be like a huge detriment to your thing.
00:28:47 I used to be a game journalist.
00:28:50 So I looked at a lot of crowdfunding campaigns, you know, I'm a writer.
00:28:56 Yeah, exactly. And you look at you look at mighty number nine.
00:29:01 You look at broken age and you see examples of people who got too much
00:29:06 money and they didn't know what to do with it.
00:29:09 I don't want to raise the money that could live up to Jeff.
00:29:12 Let's not put the idea in people's heads that it's bad for me to make too much
00:29:16 money. The thing is, that's why I I know all those things.
00:29:20 And that's why I styled the Kickstarter this way, because the one I saw
00:29:24 where like I learned all this from because we're from the My Little Pony
00:29:28 community was the Brony documentary that fucking what's the greatest community
00:29:33 of John DeLancey, John DeLancey put together.
00:29:35 So with the Brony documentary, they asked for like a pretty small amount of money
00:29:40 and they ended up making six times what they asked, but they kept like
00:29:44 like all the extended tiers were like, you know, oh, we'll add in this many
00:29:48 interviews, we'll go to this convention and stuff.
00:29:51 And what the thing is that they didn't account for like reshoots or having to
00:29:55 pay audio people to do all like, like having to move the whole crew between
00:30:00 each location, you know, they were just thinking like, yeah, we'll go,
00:30:03 we'll add more, you know, but then it ended up being you have to add way more
00:30:08 because every like every little thing you add is so much more.
00:30:11 It's kind of like how, um, as any of us can tell you, because we all edit
00:30:14 video, like if you make a five minute video versus a 10 minute video,
00:30:19 it's literally twice the work.
00:30:21 And for the audience, it's barely a difference.
00:30:24 You know, they just see it as like, yeah, the video is like five to 10 minutes
00:30:27 long, but you, you really do have to edit five whole more minutes.
00:30:31 And that means that all of the work that the first half took, you have to do twice.
00:30:36 So if you're adding twice as much on, you're doubling the work.
00:30:40 And so like, I mean, there's count for that, you know, there's, there's ways to
00:30:43 cheat, like for instance, if you just play CS go nonstop and talk over it.
00:30:48 Oh, well, that's true.
00:30:49 But the videos are easy to make in the first place with those.
00:30:51 Yeah.
00:30:52 But I, there are actually like ways to cheat with thinking video.
00:30:55 Like the more live action footage you can put into a video where you're talking
00:30:59 about anime, the less you have to think about what I'm not going to put in this
00:31:04 part.
00:31:04 There's ways around it.
00:31:05 And I'm, I'm also, I used to do a lot of that where I used to like, you know,
00:31:08 throw game footage in for a couple of minutes.
00:31:10 If like, I didn't know what to show there and I didn't want to edit that whole
00:31:13 section, the best example being your sword art online rant, which is literally
00:31:17 just an hour and a half of you playing terror online.
00:31:22 Well, that was cause I, I didn't think I'd be able to get past copyright
00:31:25 if I tried to edit the show.
00:31:26 And I didn't want it to look at the show for the time it would take to edit
00:31:29 a fucking hour of whatever happened to that old brony community.
00:31:34 Those swell guys, whatever.
00:31:36 They're embroiled in turmoil about how one of them may or may not have been
00:31:40 slightly mean to the others.
00:31:41 It's tearing them apart.
00:31:43 It's tearing them apart.
00:31:44 I, yeah.
00:31:48 I think the best Kickstarter that I've ever seen actually is from Internet
00:31:56 Comment Etiquette, which I don't know if you guys watch that channel.
00:32:00 But I, I suck his dick like every day.
00:32:03 I've almost watched it many times.
00:32:06 He's, he's really seen a bunch of them, but not recently.
00:32:08 So he did an episode about commenting on crowdfunding campaigns.
00:32:12 And then at the end of that, he made a Kickstarter called Eric drinks wine
00:32:16 and gets a haircut, which is to fund the documentary about him drinking
00:32:21 wine and getting a haircut.
00:32:23 And then he, because he is who he is, he decided to make a joke out of
00:32:28 taking for fucking ever to get a haircut and drink wine.
00:32:33 How much money did he raise out of curiosity on that?
00:32:36 Um, God, like 10,000 dollars.
00:32:39 It was something ridiculous.
00:32:40 Let me, let me, let me look at the people of the problem.
00:32:43 The people of the potato salad thing all over.
00:32:46 Yeah.
00:32:46 Yeah.
00:32:47 Yeah.
00:32:47 Yeah.
00:32:47 It's, it, it wasn't quite the potato salad thing, but the potato salad one
00:32:51 though is so indicative of how to do a Kickstarter right because only raised $4,000.
00:32:57 It's all about making your audience feel like they're a part of something
00:33:01 exactly they're contributing to something that's, that's fun.
00:33:05 You know, like the potato salad thing is like, you can give one dollar to this
00:33:09 thing and be able to, to be like, you know, forever be like, huh, I gave a
00:33:13 dollar to a fucking potato salad thing.
00:33:15 You know, from the, from the end of the potato salad guys, it's ridiculous
00:33:19 that they made so much money.
00:33:20 It was my favorite, the user experience is simple.
00:33:23 You just gave a dollar to be a part of my favorite Kickstarter of all time to
00:33:26 this day was one made by our own Ben St.
00:33:28 That was Ben St.
00:33:29 makes a page, a Kickstarter campaign.
00:33:32 No, no, it was.
00:33:33 It was a Patreon.
00:33:34 It was a Patreon, right?
00:33:35 Actually, my, my, what, what is currently my Ben St.
00:33:38 Patreon was originally a joke, a joke Patreon that I converted to a legit one.
00:33:43 Oh, I didn't know.
00:33:44 Yeah.
00:33:44 The original one was Ben St.
00:33:45 It was great.
00:33:45 It was better then.
00:33:46 Please go back.
00:33:47 Yeah.
00:33:47 It was Ben St.
00:33:48 is creating a Patreon and the joke of the Patreon was that the Patreon itself
00:33:53 was my Magnum Opus that I would be like continually building on and like nobody
00:33:58 I even bought a space for it a little bit.
00:34:00 Like I thought I thought it was funny.
00:34:03 Like I thought people might see it and pledge like a dollar just to be like,
00:34:06 yeah, I pledged to this joke patron, but nobody have had there been any pledges
00:34:10 already there.
00:34:11 Yeah.
00:34:12 Yeah.
00:34:12 That's some of us pledged a little on your request, didn't we?
00:34:16 That's another important thing with it didn't.
00:34:19 It didn't catch the way I was hoping it was.
00:34:21 Oh, sorry.
00:34:23 Did you brought up something that's that's another important thing with a
00:34:25 successful Patreon because like I or Kickstarter for that matter.
00:34:30 But like being honest is important and allowing the audience to interact is
00:34:35 important, but the other thing is creating a perception of value.
00:34:39 So like one of the biggest things that you can do to have a successful
00:34:44 Kickstarter or Patreon is have a like make a bunch of your friends agree to put
00:34:49 in a couple of dollars for the first month or so.
00:34:53 Just just so that it looks like it's not dead, you know,
00:34:59 yeah, so make sure it doesn't sound too because like if you if you phrase it
00:35:03 that way, it can sound kind of like shady.
00:35:05 Like we're trying to make it look bigger than it is.
00:35:07 But it's just like if someone says zero, they think I can't save this.
00:35:11 Yeah, yeah.
00:35:12 It's it's it's the full tip jar effect.
00:35:14 Right.
00:35:14 Like if you see a tip jar that has no money in it, you're not going to put
00:35:17 money in it.
00:35:18 But if you see a tip jar that's got like five, 10 bucks in singles in it,
00:35:22 you're going to be like, Oh, I could put a dollar.
00:35:23 Yeah.
00:35:24 And like, do you call the better business bureau over that shit?
00:35:26 Like, no, it's it's not it's not a big deal.
00:35:29 Yeah.
00:35:29 And I mean, I think we've we've also we're also in a fortunate position
00:35:34 that we have an audience that's willing to be like
00:35:38 to immediately give us money so that we don't have to do the full tip jar thing.
00:35:41 But yeah, I think a huge part of why this Kickstarter has taken off
00:35:46 like so fast in such a big way to me, the one being Jesse you're doing
00:35:49 is because I offered a limit to reward that if you paid a hundred dollars,
00:35:54 you get to pick one of the shows.
00:35:55 And those two went instantaneously.
00:35:59 Of course, like even if this show, even if only like 20 people had cared about it,
00:36:05 two of those people immediately cared enough to give a hundred dollars.
00:36:08 And what I would like to see right now, wow, this Kickstarter is on the track
00:36:11 to success. You know, I want to see.
00:36:13 I want to see one of those guys make a Kickstarter campaign to choose which show
00:36:17 he gets to pick for Digi Bros. Believe in the Weeb.
00:36:21 I hope it just keeps going forever.
00:36:25 You know, and by the way, I just wanted to say again, how much I agree with
00:36:29 what I want that I just like, I want that Kickstarter to be like,
00:36:33 like the main goal is like one show, but then every stretch goal is a different show.
00:36:37 Like, oh, no.
00:36:39 A more controversial show.
00:36:40 So the more money he makes the more controversial the show is.
00:36:43 You've got to do tactical pledges and unpledges in various.
00:36:46 You can't do shit right.
00:36:48 I was just going to say that I really was I was thinking about this
00:36:52 as your as your thing was going off.
00:36:55 And I would just think like, let's say that this Patreon campaign had been
00:36:58 like a like a fifty thousand dollar project, just just for argument's sake.
00:37:03 And like if that happened and it met that and then even exceeded that,
00:37:07 that would be getting into some seriously like ridiculous money, you know,
00:37:11 being exchanged. And at that point, it just it worries me
00:37:15 when like guys like just like little people like us doing stuff like this.
00:37:19 And if it could damage the personal relationships between people,
00:37:24 this is something that I've been thinking about for a while, how like having
00:37:28 having a corporate wall in between like where money goes,
00:37:31 sometimes sometimes can be a really helpful thing for preventing
00:37:34 like accountability of where money goes.
00:37:36 And this is just because I am the most I don't know anyone in the world
00:37:40 who cares about money more than me.
00:37:41 I care. I think about it all the time.
00:37:43 Everything I do is motivated by making sure I have enough at the end of the day
00:37:47 to get the things I want to get.
00:37:49 And it's it's it's fucked me over in many ways,
00:37:51 but it's made me extremely keen to any issues involving like shadiness
00:37:56 or like other people trying to pull one over on me.
00:37:58 And also makes me want to pull things over on other people all the time.
00:38:01 And I will if I can ever do it.
00:38:03 So don't trust me, people.
00:38:04 I mean, I make me accountable.
00:38:08 It's funny because I I always fear that I'm going to fuck that up
00:38:12 because yeah, everything I do has been very loose.
00:38:15 Like the money situations that we deal with are exceedingly loose.
00:38:19 Like me and Jesse both.
00:38:21 And that can be dangerous.
00:38:22 Well, like because me and Jesse have done a lot of collaborations
00:38:24 in like, for instance, The Plebe and the Weeb.
00:38:27 Each episode, Jesse marked on Patreon, which is fine,
00:38:30 because he edited all of them.
00:38:31 So he definitely, you know, but I I didn't because I didn't see it as
00:38:35 like my mainline content.
00:38:37 You know, I didn't see it as like each one of these should be Patreon by me.
00:38:40 And Jesse did most of the work anyway.
00:38:41 So like, you know, who am I to to make twice what he would have made off of it?
00:38:46 You know, just because it's on my channel.
00:38:48 But like, but like, I kind of see it as this exchange
00:38:52 because we never know collaboration I've done with anybody.
00:38:54 Have we agreed beforehand?
00:38:56 Like how much money would be paid out?
00:38:57 It's all been like, hey, I think you deserve to have money from this.
00:39:02 Or I think we should do another collab.
00:39:05 You know, like every time Jesse patrons, something that me and him worked on together,
00:39:09 I just think, well, that's another video that I'm going to get Jesse to do with me later,
00:39:13 you know, or, you know, I'm about to do a show with with Jeff in the near future
00:39:20 about Re Zero on his channel because I got I got him to do one on a race on my channel.
00:39:25 You know, I probably made like a hundred bucks off that video.
00:39:28 So if Jeff can make a hundred bucks off of me being on his show, then, you know,
00:39:32 it's even made twice as much money as we would have made if I just split the bill.
00:39:36 You know, yeah.
00:39:37 So like I do think that, you know, it's something you have to kind of tread carefully with
00:39:42 because I think everyone who's been working with me on these shows
00:39:46 understands that I am making a profit from this, you know, whether I offer them money or not.
00:39:51 I think if you go into it and like you don't say anything about wanting money
00:39:56 and then, you know, you come knocking later like, hey, where's the money?
00:39:59 Like I don't remember offering it to you, you know,
00:40:02 but I think I would probably give them something if they, you know, if they begged like, man,
00:40:06 this is this is a dangerous topic.
00:40:09 I just see pitfalls everywhere.
00:40:10 You know, I think I think that the fact that we're all friends
00:40:14 and the fact that we're all again, generally honest people has kept this fairly safe, you know,
00:40:19 and like, you know, that's true.
00:40:21 But I always just everything so far has been 100 percent great.
00:40:24 But yeah, I always think that somewhere down the line,
00:40:27 if we get involved financially with each other, that would be the one thing
00:40:30 that could cause theoretical problems.
00:40:32 And you know, I think about that for every business relationship of everyone in the world.
00:40:35 Like even if you room with someone, like that can get messy.
00:40:39 I've had difficulties with friends over the years, but that's why I live with them.
00:40:42 That's why you're like important to Analyst Inc, Nate,
00:40:46 because you're you're like you you're not a scumbag, but you think like a scumbag.
00:40:51 And that's what you think you piece of shit.
00:40:54 Yeah, but that means you can be our scumbag watchdog.
00:40:58 Yeah, that's true.
00:40:59 That is true.
00:40:59 My thought process though is just to be extremely cutthroat about it.
00:41:02 If any of you fucks me, I will never speak to you again.
00:41:05 Yeah, yeah, what if I fuck you just a little bit?
00:41:09 If you what if I give you a little reach around?
00:41:12 What if I give you a little reach around, you know?
00:41:14 That sounds like a positive thing.
00:41:15 You know, while I'm fucking you, what if I fuck you?
00:41:18 But I give you a little reach around.
00:41:19 Maybe that's just the courteous thing to do.
00:41:21 Luckily, I don't have the patience to fuck any of you.
00:41:24 I might have the desire.
00:41:26 I might have the desire to steal from you and betray you in the most
00:41:29 heinous ways possible, but I just don't care.
00:41:32 Oh, but see, but see, this is exactly why crowdfunding is so
00:41:35 such like an interesting topic socially, because like even just
00:41:39 bringing it up at all has made us get into this thing about like,
00:41:41 can we trust each other?
00:41:42 Like, where do our boundaries lie?
00:41:44 Like, what's the responsibility of us to like manage each other?
00:41:46 That's kind of what all money and interaction is.
00:41:49 Like, it's all a system of trust.
00:41:51 It's all based on the idea that if I give you something,
00:41:54 you will give me something in return, you know, and that's entirely
00:41:57 a trust based thing.
00:41:59 And that's why, again, I think that's part of why we all
00:42:01 feel so lied to when every day I go to some fucking fast food
00:42:05 place and I buy something and they half cook it and they
00:42:08 sloppily throw it together.
00:42:09 And I'm like, why can't I just fucking get an honest transaction
00:42:13 that I get my money's worth out of what I fucking bought.
00:42:15 And so when you can actually make the same argument with the ads
00:42:19 that you should know by now that fast food is going to be shit.
00:42:22 So it's your own fault.
00:42:23 Yeah.
00:42:23 And and and so again, when like when people, you know, donate to
00:42:28 my channel and they actually see videos that they, you know,
00:42:31 care about, then they're like, finally, a transaction that I feel
00:42:34 good about in my life, you know, and I'm sure there's some people
00:42:36 who don't feel good about every single one.
00:42:38 And I'm always telling, like, you know, my patrons, there's no
00:42:41 guilt if you leave, you know, like, if you don't like what I'm doing
00:42:45 not to pay for, like, you know, you can set a cap for the month.
00:42:47 Or, you know, that's the great thing about it's really on you
00:42:50 as a as a payer, what you want to pay for and what you don't want
00:42:53 to pay. Exactly.
00:42:54 They're both all the all the crowdfunding sites are very like
00:42:58 you know, in favor of the buyer and that's I also that's why I
00:43:01 favor Kickstarter over like Indiegogo or GoFundMe because in
00:43:06 Kickstarter, you have to make the full amount before you get
00:43:08 paid, you know, if it if on the other sites, if you don't make
00:43:11 the full amount, you can still just pocket all the money they
00:43:14 gave you, whether you can even afford to do the thing or not,
00:43:16 you know, it's more of like a donation charity kind of thing,
00:43:20 which I mean, I'm not opposed to it, but Indiegogo is where
00:43:24 scummy kick starters that couldn't make it on Kickstarter go for a
00:43:27 second run.
00:43:29 Yeah, to be fair, or perhaps something like, you know, like
00:43:33 like a pity party like guys, I'm being abused by myself. I need
00:43:36 to move out of my house where my Tulpa lives. I need to leave
00:43:39 him behind, you know, you know, so like my you make, you know,
00:43:43 half the money you're looking for that's still helpful. Maybe
00:43:46 something like that would be appropriate. I don't know. I'm
00:43:48 just thinking about when it could be a good idea.
00:43:50 I want to I want to get into now the topic of kick starters, I
00:43:53 have a problem with and I'm not talking about the obviously
00:43:56 bad ones, the ones that everyone thinks are like a scam or
00:43:58 something like that. But I am talking about the ones that
00:44:01 turn out bad. And I feel like we we should have known and to to
00:44:07 that come to mind and I was thinking about doing a vlog
00:44:10 about this anyways, why I'm gonna get into this rant here is
00:44:14 mighty number nine. And while it remains to be seen if it will
00:44:17 be good, that Castlevania one what's a bloodstained lords
00:44:21 bloodstained bloodstained will be good. I don't know man. I've
00:44:24 I've seen I've seen some of the like footage of the game. It
00:44:29 doesn't. Okay, what bothers me about it is that it doesn't look
00:44:32 as good as Castlevania. You know, like it doesn't look as good as
00:44:35 Symphony of the Night, which is everyone's paying for it
00:44:37 because they want it to be another Symphony of the Night. But
00:44:40 it doesn't look as good as Symphony of the Night. What's
00:44:41 the point?
00:44:42 It doesn't look as good. Are you talking visually or
00:44:44 mechanically?
00:44:46 Visually, mostly. Okay, because I mean, we're close. Because I
00:44:50 mean, the thing is that it looks 3d now. So it's it looks
00:44:53 substantially better than anything that they could have
00:44:56 done at the time of Symphony of the Night. But the thing is
00:44:58 that Symphony of the Night, you're thinking about in terms
00:45:01 of PS one aesthetics. And yeah, Symphony of the Night was
00:45:04 impressive for a PS one.
00:45:05 No, I'm thinking of it in terms of if you look at both right
00:45:08 now, Symphony of the Night looks fucking great. And that game
00:45:10 looks like shit. Because that game has this goofy fucking 2.5d
00:45:15 shitty graphics, where the characters look floaty as fuck.
00:45:18 And there's no like, there's not enough frames to the animation
00:45:21 to have that satisfying line.
00:45:22 Hang on. That's, that's, it's, it's kind of irrelevant how, how
00:45:26 pretty the game looks because you just won't fund it. But what's
00:45:29 important about the situation is whether or not what they're
00:45:31 doing is deceptive or is like
00:45:33 not that it's deceptive, but you know, here's what bothers me
00:45:35 about both of these cases, specifically with why I think
00:45:39 they got funded, right? Because it's, it's nostalgia. It's one
00:45:44 is a guy who's saying who's saying I created Castlevania
00:45:47 Symphony of the Night, you guys all love that game. They won't
00:45:50 let me make another one. So help me make another one. And then
00:45:53 this other guy, KG Nefune, like I made Mega Man, you all love
00:45:56 Mega Man, they won't let me make another one, help me make
00:45:58 another one. But like, why are they not able to make another
00:46:03 one?
00:46:03 The profound. Okay, so there's a difference.
00:46:07 Capcom's a piece of shit.
00:46:09 Capcom's a piece of shit. Konami is an enormous piece of
00:46:12 shit. Konami is the biggest piece of shit in the world. And
00:46:16 they will literally do stuff not to make money, just despite
00:46:20 the people who work for them. But the difference, the difference
00:46:25 between KG Nefune and Koji Igarashi, Ega, Ega. Yeah, that's
00:46:30 right, Egarashi. Koji Igarashi is that Inafune is a producer,
00:46:35 whereas Igarashi is actually a game designer. And that's what I
00:46:40 think the key difference between those campaigns is because
00:46:43 what I'm getting is staying with Mighty Number nine was, I have
00:46:46 a game idea, I'm going to take your money and hire another
00:46:50 company to make it for me, which is basically like the grown up
00:46:55 million dollar version of that guy in game design chat rooms who
00:46:59 says he's the ideas guy.
00:47:02 My favorite guy.
00:47:04 Here's what I'm getting at, though.
00:47:05 That guy's got it all figured out, man.
00:47:08 Castlevania Symphony of the Night. That game is is legendary.
00:47:13 But Igarashi then made like eight more games that were the
00:47:18 exact same fucking thing.
00:47:20 And they're great.
00:47:21 And they're great.
00:47:21 I love every single one of them.
00:47:23 Dawn of Sorrow.
00:47:24 I already have so many fucking good best, best one.
00:47:27 Dawn of Sorrow's best Castlevania.
00:47:29 How do you guys all play the last DS game?
00:47:32 Did you make it that far?
00:47:33 Was that Order of Ecclesia?
00:47:34 Because that was a great game.
00:47:35 Yeah, that was a great game.
00:47:37 I played every single one since Castlevania of the Night.
00:47:40 Was Ecclesia the one with the paintings?
00:47:41 Because the paintings one was fucking cool.
00:47:43 No, that was that was Portrait of Ruin.
00:47:45 Portrait of Ruin, right?
00:47:46 That was so good.
00:47:48 I'm telling you, dude, they were all good up to Order of Ecclesia.
00:47:50 Well, how about Mega Man?
00:47:51 Do you know anybody who played every Mega Man game?
00:47:55 Because that's the thing.
00:47:56 They made a ton in both of these cases.
00:47:58 Both of these are franchises that they were not performing as well
00:48:03 by the end of their life.
00:48:05 You know, these are games that were selling less and less
00:48:08 that were getting lower and lower metacritic scores, you know.
00:48:11 And like so when when the creators come back and are like,
00:48:15 hey, remember me?
00:48:16 I made Symphony of the Night.
00:48:18 I'm thinking, yeah, but you also made all those other games
00:48:21 that you're not mentioning that no one cares about as much as Symphony of the Night.
00:48:24 Or, hey, I made Mega Man.
00:48:26 And I'm like, yeah, but they made 10 Mega Mans.
00:48:27 And by Mega Man 10, no one was buying it anymore.
00:48:30 You know, that's why they're not making Mega Man.
00:48:33 I didn't speak to market forces about Castlevania,
00:48:35 but I will say that Ecclesia was a great game.
00:48:38 And if they just made the more in that spirit,
00:48:40 then we would have some great games.
00:48:41 I think that Konami just chose not to for whatever reason.
00:48:44 Konami chooses like Konami just straight up is a shitty company.
00:48:50 Like this is this is this is like a cannon fact.
00:48:54 They have no idea what they are.
00:48:57 Yeah, they have no idea what the market wants, right?
00:49:01 They like they are there's there's a lot of writing out there about how shit.
00:49:06 Konami, they they are their their solution to continuing
00:49:10 Metal Gear Solid without without
00:49:15 Hideo Kojima involved.
00:49:17 Yeah, why am I having so much trouble remembering Japanese names today?
00:49:21 Anyway, their solution to continuing MGS without Kojima involved
00:49:25 is fucking Call of Duty Zombies, like not even anything above that.
00:49:30 It's just Call of Duty Zombies in in a parallel universe to Metal Gear to present
00:49:35 to present like a good and bad side of this.
00:49:38 And like why I think it's working,
00:49:40 but also why I think a lot of people are getting disappointed
00:49:44 is because I think that what's great about Kickstarter
00:49:47 is it allows those people who do still care to give like more money
00:49:52 than they could have given to just buying the game.
00:49:55 You know, like most people think of it in terms of I bought this game.
00:49:59 It was twenty five dollars.
00:50:00 But even if I love it more than every other game I've ever bought,
00:50:04 it's still you know, it's it's a game.
00:50:05 It's twenty five dollars.
00:50:07 But if you're someone who actually feels that strongly about it
00:50:09 and like what's great about Kickstarter and Patreon is you can just throw
00:50:12 as much money as it as you feel, you know.
00:50:15 And I think that's something that's very powerful
00:50:18 and it's becoming more and more apparent that people can do that when like
00:50:21 one of my favorite Vati video videos is where he just shows that he's bought
00:50:24 Dark Souls like six times, like every time he just feels a swell of emotion
00:50:28 about how much he loves Dark Souls, he buys it again, you know.
00:50:31 And I'm like, that's awesome because if if these games are being made
00:50:35 for just that niche audience and that niche audience felt so strongly about it
00:50:40 that they're willing to just give whatever it takes, then like cool.
00:50:44 But I think that once these games escape
00:50:46 because of the fact that, you know, a big deal is made about it
00:50:48 because it's a Kickstarter and all that and and everyone's like, yeah,
00:50:51 I remember Symphony of the Night and then they play the game
00:50:53 and they're going to be like, oh, this isn't, you know,
00:50:56 this isn't the best game ever made like I thought it was going to be
00:51:00 because you raised so much money for a Kickstarter and I thought of Symphony of the Night.
00:51:04 And it's like, yeah, but you should have been expecting
00:51:06 like Order of Ecclesia or like the later games are the ones that, you know,
00:51:09 the people who still care about this one, you know, the amount of money
00:51:12 that they raised for the amount of money that they raised for a Kickstarter
00:51:16 is a fraction of the budget of like a triple A video game.
00:51:20 Like even even the biggest kick starters out there are still like.
00:51:27 They're they're huge budgets for.
00:51:29 Didn't Shenmue three like break every record
00:51:31 and that was only like a tenth of the total cost or something that it needed
00:51:34 to be like Shenmue three could only exist on Kickstarter
00:51:38 because Sony was like, OK, we will pony up ten times as much money
00:51:42 as what people are putting into this Kickstarter because the Kickstarter shows
00:51:45 a market willingness to engage with the product.
00:51:48 But like the thing with bloodstained that I think is good compared to.
00:51:54 Mighty number nine, there were never not Mega Man like games on the market.
00:51:59 You know, like like Shovel Knight is a much better Mega Man game.
00:52:04 Then then Mighty number nine is there are tons of people
00:52:08 making Mega Man like games.
00:52:10 There are tons of people making Metroidvania games, too,
00:52:13 but nothing that is like Castlevania.
00:52:16 Watch out, we got some people who are going to get triggered by that word.
00:52:19 Well, all right, I mean, I'll go to that.
00:52:22 But I think but I think so much of what's integral
00:52:25 to what makes those Castlevania games fun, the Egavania games
00:52:28 was the production values, the spirits are so great.
00:52:32 And the the the the hit sparks and flashes as as a Egoraptor put it, you know,
00:52:37 when he was he was talking about how the Egavania games
00:52:40 don't have the same like depth of control and absolutely godly animation.
00:52:45 The I mean, not the animation, but the fucking character art
00:52:47 that was fucking shat on for Dawn of Sorrow and Portrait of Ruin.
00:52:50 I'm still mad about it.
00:52:52 But at least they fix it for at least yeah.
00:52:53 Oh, yeah, they are there was shit.
00:52:56 But but like I just think that people aren't realizing that
00:53:00 like you cannot fund them just making you your favorite game again.
00:53:07 You know, no, you're not going to be that way.
00:53:09 You're never going to you when you buy Metal Gear Solid 5,
00:53:12 the money gets evenly split between Konami's like slot machine division
00:53:16 and the game division. They don't give a shit. No.
00:53:18 You're never going to just crowd fund
00:53:22 like the same best game you played before unless it's, you know, it like if.
00:53:27 OK, if if Toby Fox came out with a Kickstarter,
00:53:31 like we could expect that it might be a game that's as good as Undertale
00:53:34 because Undertale was a Kickstarter game.
00:53:36 It was always for $10,000. Right.
00:53:39 But but but Toby Fox doesn't know.
00:53:43 No, but Toby Fox doesn't have to kickstart
00:53:46 Undertale to probably not because well, not anymore.
00:53:48 Not any more. Toby Fox is actually a millionaire now.
00:53:52 Right. Well, I mean, OK.
00:53:53 And that's something to keep in mind.
00:53:56 Like, like I put I put some money in.
00:53:58 But that's from sales of a fantastic.
00:54:00 Yes, exactly. He deserves it.
00:54:02 And I deserve some money because that's original content.
00:54:05 And original content is what deserves money.
00:54:08 Not. Yeah. Shut the fuck up.
00:54:10 I agree. I agree, Jeff.
00:54:12 I couldn't agree more. You've been debunked here by the memebusters.
00:54:16 Once again, Digi.
00:54:17 Anyway, I put money into that game indivisible.
00:54:20 Right. Because of the fact that it's the same people who did Skullgirls.
00:54:24 I'm so I'm so I'm so lacking in things to say this episode.
00:54:29 I got a chip in and say the indivisible
00:54:31 Kickstarter looked like fucking garbage.
00:54:33 Oh, I was so pretty.
00:54:35 I'm not necessarily convinced that it's going to play the demo.
00:54:38 It fucking sucked.
00:54:40 It wasn't great. The demo was not good, but it also was a prototype.
00:54:44 It was a prototype. It was a process.
00:54:45 I was a big naysayer, too. I don't know.
00:54:47 It happened. And now I'm saying whatever.
00:54:49 Like, it's not a huge difference.
00:54:51 But they released it as a fucking teaser for this is what our game
00:54:54 is going to be like. And it was at least as like a product prototype.
00:54:58 Like what you would do if you were like, you know, when you have a building,
00:55:01 you're going to build and you build a little scale model of it to show people
00:55:04 this is what the building will look like. That's what a prototype is.
00:55:07 That's why they called it that.
00:55:08 Yeah. And it wasn't a demo.
00:55:09 And it is. It's it's like you're in Zoolander right now, Ben.
00:55:12 Like like with the with the music, you know, the school for ants.
00:55:16 You're like, this is how are they going to play this game?
00:55:19 How do you judge this game? It's not even finished yet.
00:55:22 It's got it's only a beta. No, no, no.
00:55:25 It's accurately judge what it's.
00:55:27 No, no, Ben, Ben want to kind of let just just a sec, Ben.
00:55:32 Prototype is not a beta.
00:55:34 A prototype is not an alpha.
00:55:36 A prototype. I don't care.
00:55:38 Where did you use? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:55:40 I'm showcasing what it was.
00:55:42 No, it is not.
00:55:44 Ben, it's it's a. No, it is not a prototype.
00:55:48 Ben, Ben, Ben, can we please clarify exactly
00:55:51 what your complaint is about the game that it wasn't fun and it was bad just it
00:55:54 just a sec okay just a sec Ben yeah right a prototype is not any of the code
00:56:00 that will go into the final game at all it is are you telling me that the yes I
00:56:06 am telling you type that I played there's no resemblance at all to the game
00:56:10 that I don't answer that that's a trap the prototype that you played is a
00:56:16 testing bed for things that they will use in the final code the thing is when
00:56:22 you make a video game nothing that you fucking put into the prototype goes into
00:56:28 the final game except for maybe art assets in the same way as if you drew a
00:56:34 bunch of shitty concept art that was just like napkin concept art for a comic
00:56:40 that you want to work on and then you did the comic later and somebody saw that
00:56:43 napkin and was like well this comic looks like fucking garbage I'm not gonna
00:56:47 read it that's what you're doing look Jeff don't that's what you're doing me for
00:56:52 one thing and for second thing the fact that they included this prototype with
00:56:55 their Kickstarter means that they deemed it representative of their product and
00:57:00 it was bad I took the prototype to be that they were saying hey this is
00:57:11 generally what our game is going to play and look and feel like if that's your
00:57:16 thing and donate you know not that it's going to literally be this that it's you
00:57:22 know here's what the mechanics are like so because it's kind of hard to describe
00:57:25 on paper just by saying yeah it's super Metroid I didn't alchemy profile I didn't
00:57:29 like them yeah I didn't like them again can we at least agree can we at least
00:57:33 agree that it is reasonable for Ben to come to a negative impression of the
00:57:38 game based on the prototype and not be interested I don't think that's
00:57:41 unreasonable I just think that it would be unreasonable to think that the final
00:57:45 product will be reflective of okay but the case then what is even really the
00:57:50 use of it if it like if you can just with this argument then what's the point
00:57:54 prototype is the same point as the or is the same purpose as concept art on a
00:57:59 Kickstarter again it's we this is the idea that we're trying to go for this is
00:58:04 the sort of thing that we will be doing but we will have the game I have
00:58:11 to have to raise this point now exactly what what all right but what is the
00:58:14 difference at this point between a criticism of bull shots and a criticism
00:58:18 of a game that may play because they called it a prototype exactly they call it
00:58:24 unfinished they call it unfinished gameplay footage in their advertisements
00:58:28 when they do you know yeah but this wasn't an advertisement for the game it's a
00:58:31 prototype similar if it wasn't an advertisement what the fuck was it it's
00:58:35 a fucking prototype it's a proof it's something to show to investors you're
00:58:42 paying for a kickstarter you're an investor the whole if the information is
00:58:46 useless why included the information accurate it's fair to be judged either
00:58:50 way you lose and I know Nate it's simple it's fucking simple okay all right it's
00:58:57 a prototype it is not an advertisement for the game but they are putting it out
00:59:02 there as part of their Kickstarter campaign to show that they are being
00:59:06 open with their contributors in the same way that they would be open with
00:59:09 investors which is a good strategy for a Kickstarter okay but if I'm so well it
00:59:16 was a bad strategy for me because I played it all right there you go fair
00:59:19 enough Ben but if I play it and I just if I was wrong that it got funded and I
00:59:24 hate it all right hang on if I play it and I really like it and I give money
00:59:29 and then I get the game of the end and it has lost the qualities that I liked
00:59:33 initially I mean who's who's gonna take responsibility for that that seems like
00:59:36 a reasonable I think the fact that they literally said this is a prototype that
00:59:42 in no way resembles the final how does that put it on the donor to literally
00:59:50 say to the donor this is not what you're getting so please don't why this is what
00:59:57 you're not what you're getting then what is the use of showing it is to a
01:00:01 certain extent what you're getting it's a matter of degrees it's a matter of
01:00:06 degrees I think I think there's a lot you want to answer if do you think that
01:00:10 it would have been better if all the Kickstarter said was okay here's how it
01:00:13 works basically the the triangle button makes this character attack and the
01:00:17 square button makes this character attack you'll totally get it once you
01:00:19 know once the game's out you'll totally get what we're talking about but just
01:00:22 trust us it makes sense you know so so yeah so just put money in or would it be
01:00:26 better to just say look okay here's like the controls you know look at it here it
01:00:31 is here's like you know jump around a little bit you like the feel of that
01:00:33 okay that's basically what this is gonna be that's what a prototype I see what
01:00:38 you're saying and I agree that I don't hate the idea of a prototype to introduce
01:00:43 people to the gameplay but when you kind of when you have this concern of like
01:00:46 this is prototype footage or this is a prototype gameplay you can't expect this
01:00:50 to necessarily be the end result then I just wonder like there's going to be some
01:00:55 disconnect between people who liked what was there initially and the things that
01:00:59 they end up with in the end and I just think that that's kind of causing a
01:01:02 potential problem that's that's all and I think it's a nuance I think it's a
01:01:06 nuanced issue you know caveat mentor buyer beware if you can't figure out from
01:01:12 the fact that they said it's a prototype that it might not be the same game then
01:01:15 you might be literally retarded and a human idiot well you know I just think
01:01:20 that it's it takes you're right you know you have to think about it that's
01:01:24 true money if you aren't certain you like I gave money to it because of the
01:01:28 fact that I like skull girls and skull girls was a Kickstarter project I and
01:01:32 the ideas behind it are promising I love the character designers work it's the
01:01:37 kind of thing she's the best I it's a guy I it's a girl we're talking about
01:01:41 there's a guy what there's not drawn by the guy who did the art for you and I
01:01:49 talked about this there I was familiar with the girl who was like the lead
01:01:52 animator yeah but I think that's a distinct person from the character
01:01:56 designer yeah yeah I want to go on a date I'm available but the designer is
01:02:05 Alex who's a guy I met him he signed a copy of his art book for me so well
01:02:10 tell him to let me meet his girlfriend anyways you know I just I see it as
01:02:17 this is a project that is of a scale that makes sense on Kickstarter and like I
01:02:23 know I kind of feel like I know what I'm getting whereas with something like a
01:02:28 like a ukulele for instance where like I know that everyone really hopes that
01:02:33 hey it's the old Rareware boys these are the people who gave us Banjo-Kazooie but
01:02:38 Banjo-Kazooie was a triple-a game and I don't think it's good like even if it is
01:02:42 a good game it's not gonna be as good as Banjo-Kazooie it's just that's
01:02:47 I think it's distinctly possible that it could be again I think it's
01:02:51 distinctly possible that it could be because the thing about the thing about
01:02:55 Banjo-Kazooie is that that game as much as the aesthetics are important in a
01:03:01 Rareware game the most important thing in a Rareware game is juice and I guess
01:03:08 okay so juices juices a slang term for game feel right if you get if you get
01:03:17 the juice right watch Mark Brown game makers toolkit he talks about that in a
01:03:22 video I got a brown for I don't see any reason why it couldn't be as good as
01:03:27 Banjo-Kazooie yeah it could be if it's a different like if there's something
01:03:31 different about it but if it's literally just trying to be Banjo-Kazooie then
01:03:36 even if it was like mechanically identical it won't have as much polish in
01:03:40 the graphics or the animations no no but it's not no way it'll be as good it's
01:03:45 not gonna be mechanically identical their whole idea like their whole thing
01:03:49 that they're selling it as like Banjo-Kazooie is that it's a a open-world
01:03:55 character platformer where you have two characters who work in concert to do
01:04:00 different moves instead of one and you know what sucks about this whole thing
01:04:04 I'm sorry your finisher thought and yeah they're yeah well I mean that was
01:04:07 basically it I was just gonna say that like like a got a bat on the head of a
01:04:15 chameleon yeah is a very different mechanically carer character that is a
01:04:22 very different mechanical character from a bear with a bird in the backpack I
01:04:28 think well let me see it might be exactly the same intentionally you know
01:04:33 maybe the beta that they put out or the alpha or whatever stage they're at right
01:04:38 now does show like a lot of different moves and the moves the moveset for the
01:04:43 character is very very different like there's a lot of gliding and I mean it's
01:04:46 possible if it is if it is a more unique game whereas opposed to like how you
01:04:52 know like the Castlevania thing and the the mighty number nine thing are like
01:04:55 just basically exactly the same but mighty number nine had dashing you idiot
01:05:00 so did Mega Man X not change the game actually Mega Man X as shown in your
01:05:05 Raptors sequel it is dashing changed everything in Mega Man X so so it's the
01:05:09 same you know if you're just gonna make but that X was good so like yeah well
01:05:13 I'm just saying like you know mighty number nine and that Castlevania game by
01:05:17 virtue of trying to be the exact same thing and this is a you know I'm making
01:05:21 assumptions here I mean not about mine right now and everyone knows that was it
01:05:24 but like about the you know the the Castlevania game if if it tries to be the
01:05:30 exact same thing as Symphony of the Night then just by the fact that they
01:05:33 don't have you know the same amounts of or quality of people working on it means
01:05:39 it will not be as good a Symphony of the Night you know even if it is good and
01:05:42 well if you could lately is like mechanically different enough and
01:05:46 inventive enough it could be better and hell even if they just modernize the
01:05:50 fucking live system I'll probably beat it and I couldn't I could not beat
01:05:53 Banjo-Kazooie because the live system pissed me off so badly and you know what
01:05:57 that brings me to the to the biggest meme that needs to die by the way every
01:06:02 episode of the PCP is a continuing extension of the meme that needs to die
01:06:05 it's like we're in Star Trek the next generation where the test never ended for
01:06:09 humanity from episode one but what the biggest problem is capitalism it's the
01:06:17 fact that we have to do things to make money to live and you can't just make
01:06:20 art for its own sake you have to make art profitable you have to do things so
01:06:24 that you can live when are we gonna fucking get our shit together and
01:06:27 invent whatever the fuck things it is that make not communism no I ain't no
01:06:33 fucking pinko don't you look at me with that pink eye you piece of shit just say
01:06:36 you're talking about the automatic star Trek we need those things that make
01:06:41 everything you need we need to no longer worry about having to survive by if we
01:06:45 have those if it if we that's exactly right if we have those if once like my
01:06:50 little pony but once once we live close scarcity we are gonna be in a
01:06:55 communist world or something where I know I'm not a socialist yeah socialist
01:07:00 world honestly we'll need a new we'll need a new paradigm where what isn't a
01:07:04 whole different but is viewed but but like the yeah the thing is yeah that's
01:07:09 right that's right cuz capitalism only functions as long as the supply of food
01:07:16 is lower than the demand for labor and at like we don't even need to have food
01:07:23 synthesizers to get past that point we're at the point where we can automate
01:07:27 all farming we're at the point where we can automate all fucking food delivery
01:07:32 and we're close to the point where we can automate building shelter which is
01:07:36 the three necessities that people need at this point the only forgot smashing
01:07:41 puss my dog no that's that's that's what I'm getting to the puss smashing the
01:07:51 thing is the thing is the thing is at the point when we reach that the there's
01:07:56 gonna be four necessary sectors one of which we shouldn't be we shouldn't be
01:08:02 part of capitalism in the first place which is medicine medicine should just
01:08:05 be right right everybody one of which is pornography smash and puss one of
01:08:11 which okay sure is art and one of which is managing money and if we can just
01:08:17 figure out a way to get the people who fuck good and the people who make art
01:08:21 good to do that for the public good cuz they enjoy it and just give them food
01:08:27 to be happy then we could get rid of the fuckers whose only job is moving money
01:08:32 around for other people yeah we can get rid of fucking money and then we're
01:08:35 done be that would be great and but by the way while we're talking about
01:08:39 Star Trek there's oh there's only one issue with this and it's that there's
01:08:43 this one great episode of the next generation where some some guys like
01:08:46 from like the 21st century or like a 22nd or whatever where capitalism still
01:08:50 existed wake up and like Picard has a talk with one of them and there was this
01:08:54 one guy who was a rich man and he's like Picard I would like to see my accounts
01:08:58 from my various banking institutions and know how my finances have been doing in
01:09:01 the 300 years I've been asleep or whatever and Picard's like well buddy
01:09:05 things don't work that way anymore money doesn't exist so you have no more
01:09:09 influence over the world than anybody else around you and this guy is very
01:09:12 disturbed to hear that not because he's worried about his personal safety or
01:09:15 getting all the food you want those things are available to everyone just as
01:09:19 a right of being alive in the Federation but what he's concerned about is that he
01:09:23 no longer has power and control over his destiny in the way that he once had and
01:09:28 you know it's it's just a fascinating thing to think that even when you can
01:09:32 eliminate all the bare essentials we still theoretically in Star Trek they
01:09:37 kind of figured this out but we might theoretically still have this urge to
01:09:40 just rule over each other and kill and kill and rape our own butts I mean I mean
01:09:47 if we want to get pretentious you know it's the will to power you know I read
01:09:56 that buddy is that actually in Zeno saga I don't know yeah no all of the Zeno
01:10:10 like Zeno saga and Zeno gears all of those are loosely based on it's so
01:10:19 fucking weird yeah anyway the will to power is like a separate part of like
01:10:28 human consciousness and that is yeah but that's like something we can move past
01:10:35 if we just agree to not be fucking asshole yeah you know that that's the
01:10:39 thing to in Picard's you know world like in the 24th century with Picard like
01:10:43 they had pretty much all gotten over that most most humans had whereas this guy
01:10:47 was a relic from the past which is why he was still kind of driven by this urge
01:10:50 that had been weeded out of society so I don't like even in Star Trek they had
01:10:54 fixed you know if you've seen Star Trek beyond no I have not so start Star Trek
01:11:00 beyond is great it was written by Simon Pegg who actually gets Star Trek so it's
01:11:05 not like the previous two Star Trek movies where it's that's what I've heard
01:11:08 that's what I've heard and the villain is a guy who this is kind of a spoiler
01:11:17 let's just say everybody the core the core conflict of Star Trek beyond is
01:11:26 about the Federation ideals versus warlike pre-Federation ideals that's the
01:11:32 most interesting kind of conflict and the the idea that the like the Federation
01:11:38 I mean if we if we want to talk about truly great visionaries we can talk
01:11:42 about how Matt Pat from Game Theory did that theory about how the Federation is
01:11:46 fascist which is very incorrect that's not true at all but there is a
01:11:53 restriction of freedom when you don't have a capitalist system that's that's
01:11:58 just yeah like this of course there's going to be compromises no matter what
01:12:01 system you put in place even capitalism has I mean there's the basic you know
01:12:05 rules you your your right to extend your fist ends at my nose you know all that
01:12:09 all that kind of shit and and yeah I mean like capitalism has like like we
01:12:14 don't have pure capitalism we have rules against monopolies because it's super
01:12:19 obvious that monopolies make capitalism stop by the way what is to those who
01:12:24 aren't aware what is the most successful and popular program in American
01:12:28 history Medicare which is a socialist program so it's not like yeah you know
01:12:32 we got other shit and you want to know what else people really fucking like a
01:12:36 lot fired apartments police not true sometimes we've got we got it what are
01:12:42 we doing the crowdfunding yeah crowdfunding is a let's bring this back
01:12:49 crowdfunding is a stopgap between capitalism and the socialist utopia that
