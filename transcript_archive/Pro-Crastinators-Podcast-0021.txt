00:00:00 Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast PCP, and we're here
00:00:05 once again to entertain you with wildly new stories about our lives and the things that we
00:00:09 like to talk about. I'm the host of this thing, I'm the best guy ever, besty boy, Nate Cool Guy,
00:00:15 we also got Digibro, we got Ben Saint, H-R.com, Endless Jess, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Bolt,
00:00:24 Sleep, Sleep, Sleep, and The Davoo. Bunch of Z's. Yeah, because our topic for today is indeed
00:00:34 snooze factor. Sleep, the restful thing you gotta do every night. Sleep is a boring topic,
00:00:40 a lot of people say sleep is a boring topic, and I'm one of them. Sleep is a fascinating topic.
00:00:46 No, sleep is the most interesting topic in the world, and it's because I've got a great anecdote
00:00:52 about my life and how it's been ruined by sleep. Here's the thing, this podcast, conceptually,
00:00:57 if you're doing a podcast about sleep, it's all just gonna be people talking about how little
00:01:02 sleep they get, what hours they sleep, what weird ass sleep schedules they've gotten onto,
00:01:07 and possibly, if we're particularly unlucky, dreams. Oh no, we're not getting into dreams.
00:01:13 Let's avoid the topic of dreams. Except for mine, because I had a really interesting one last night.
00:01:19 You won't believe this, it was trippy. I must have been high, I must have been on drugs or
00:01:24 something, I must have been taking PCP. Shut up, I had a dream this morning, when I woke up this
00:01:30 morning, and my dream was that I had slept for like 14 hours straight, and that dream came true.
00:01:37 It was real, my life was ruined today because I slept so long, it doesn't even make sense.
00:01:41 I hate it, it's the worst. Every day I wake up, and I don't get out of bed, and I feel like I
00:01:49 have slept the entire day, I feel like it's like eight in the afternoon, I feel like I just
00:01:54 keep putting off. Eight is nighttime, it's not afternoon. I know, I feel like I've slept until
00:01:58 eight in the afternoon, but then I... No, it's night. But then, shut up, then I get up, and it's still
00:02:04 early, and I don't know, I'm confused, I'm confused about my life. I do hate that, I do hate that.
00:02:10 My schedule. And Digi famously has a retardedly gay sleep schedule, as he describes it, right?
00:02:17 Yeah, I sleep at random times, it's pretty much been that way my whole life, I've never been able
00:02:24 to like... Was school a challenge for that purpose? Yeah, like, for me it was like, you know, because
00:02:30 we had a bedtime of like 10 o'clock, and me and Victor both had this problem, we just lay in bed
00:02:35 for hours, and just stare at the fucking ceiling. You know what I would do? You know what, I did
00:02:39 that exact same thing, I would stay up and I would play my Game Boy SP, such fond memories of playing,
00:02:44 no, not my, yeah, my SP, with the fucking backlight, the backlight ruined my sleep schedule. If it
00:02:49 wasn't for that backlight, I would have gotten a thousand more hours of sleep. Yo, the reason why
00:02:53 handheld consoles are totally worthless. You gotta download Flux onto your Game Boy SP. Yeah,
00:03:06 that's right, I'm going to hurt my eyes when I'm blasting fucking Super Mario, Mario Luigi
00:03:11 Superstar Saga playing thousands of hours into the night. Exactly, that exact game with the
00:03:16 exact situation. Yeah, dude, best game of all time. So anyone want to, anyone, anyone here
00:03:23 likes sleep? Does anyone have a positive view of sleep? Well, I guess there is a whole lot less
00:03:28 of it you have to do. I love getting into bed at an appropriate time. I enjoy that. Here's what I
00:03:34 feel about sleep is I hate getting, I hate starting it, and I hate stopping it. I hate
00:03:41 everything about it. That's fair. Like when I, resigning myself to go to bed for the evening is,
00:03:48 I'm just giving up, I feel like I'm just saying just it's over, I've failed, I've failed at whatever
00:03:53 it is I'm trying to do right now, time to just embrace it, embrace oblivion. That might be more
00:03:58 true than you know, because theoretically, if you subscribe to the, well I forgot the term for it,
00:04:04 but the term that every time you go to sleep, you die and woke as a new person with new memories,
00:04:10 you very well, might have failed. That's actually what I'm counting on when I go to bed.
00:04:14 To be reborn like a magnificent phoenix. I don't have a sleep schedule, like I don't go to bed when
00:04:19 I'm physically tired, I go to bed when I'm emotionally exhausted and drained, and I don't want to live
00:04:25 in this world anymore, and I just want this version of me to die, so that tomorrow some new man can
00:04:30 take my place, and maybe make some more leeway than I did, maybe chip away at the world a little bit
00:04:36 more than I accomplished. Which really, if you think about it, is what humanity does on a whole
00:04:40 as well. We're just sending out new foot soldiers to try to pave ways for the rest of us. I completely
00:04:44 relate to what Jesse was saying, though, and I brought that up at the end of Insomnia Analysis
00:04:50 too, where I was saying that whenever I have these days where it's like being awake is only
00:04:58 going to make me more miserable, and the only thing I can do is try to sleep. Oh yeah, right,
00:05:03 I remember that. It's like a reset button, it's like, okay, fuck yeah, this is all a failure,
00:05:08 it all has to burn, we'll try again. It doesn't work, it doesn't work, because the longer you
00:05:15 sleep, at least this is for me, the longer I sleep, the guiltier I feel when I wake up.
00:05:21 It only makes everything worse. Well, Ben, I have some luck in this regard. You can restart,
00:05:26 you can reset the SEGA as many times as you want, you're still playing the same shitty game. It's
00:05:30 still fucking Disney's Roar of the Beast. You're still playing fucking Sonic and Knuckles, and you
00:05:35 don't have the expansion. Oh, it's like... I have some luck in that situation, Ben, because I don't
00:05:45 have any way of keeping track how long of how long, like, I kind of think... What do you mean,
00:05:50 you don't have a clock? Well, I fall asleep, and I'm like, well, because you know, I usually have
00:05:56 to lay in bed for like an hour before I'll actually pass out, so I don't really know when I fell asleep,
00:06:01 I have like a kind of vague idea, and then I wake up and it's like, well, I guess I slept for eight
00:06:08 hours, maybe it was 10, I really am not entirely sure. I'm such a fuck, I need to, I can't allow
00:06:13 my, because it'll happen to me like it happened today, I'll sleep for fucking 12 hours straight
00:06:18 if I don't set my alarms for eight hours. I don't even know why, I'm a deformed individual,
00:06:23 I'm not a real human being, I've got some shit fucked up inside me, I have to, I have to set this,
00:06:28 like, I set literally like eight alarms to go off in five minute intervals every morning, that I,
00:06:34 it's a real fucking annoyance every night when I go to sleep, I have to calculate, okay, eight
00:06:38 hours from now, I'm gonna need like 10 billion alarms to go off, so I don't fucking waste the
00:06:43 entire day. You want me to talk about how I get myself awake and all that stuff, okay, so I'll
00:06:48 start with at the beginning of life when sleeping is miserable, because you're a kid, you can't
00:06:52 decide anything, and your parents are old people who don't understand, no white noise, white noise
00:06:57 wasn't invented yet, when they were people, and freaking ASMR wasn't invented at all yet, right?
00:07:03 White noise existed, just wasn't something you could load up on your computer. Well, it was all
00:07:08 black and white noise. If you couldn't load it on your computer, it effectively didn't exist,
00:07:11 you had to create your own white noise farm, like a wind farm. Yeah, like in the old days,
00:07:15 they had out, they would hibernate. Quite individual. You had to grow TVs out of the soil
00:07:20 with little rabbit ear antennae, that's how you pluck them out of the ground, like turn them.
00:07:25 Brief tangent. I discovered white noise, like, incidentally, because like there was an attic
00:07:31 fan, like right next to, right outside my bedroom door, and whenever there was something to happen
00:07:36 in the house that we had the attic fan out, you know, like some corpses that we had to burn,
00:07:39 something like that, I don't know, I don't know. We turned on the attic fan, you know,
00:07:43 to whisper away all of the sin, and I would just be laying there in other tranquility,
00:07:49 and I was like, what is this that's going on? How is all this noise making me sleep better?
00:07:55 Oh my gosh, too bad I'm a kid with no agency over my life and can't just turn on this attic
00:08:00 fan every night, all night. You know, so then when I get my room, have my own computer, I
00:08:04 discover like white noise, and immediately get into rain sounds, shout out to rainymood.com,
00:08:09 it's rain all the time. On that subject, I gotta say that the onset of summer has been the best
00:08:15 thing for my sleep life, because now I have an air conditioner unit in my window, it's super loud
00:08:20 and rattly, but it's perfect white noise, it's like the, it's like the thumb of a mother's heartbeat
00:08:25 as I rest in the womb. Yeah, man. Yeah, it's like a heartbeat. I keep it, I keep it at max,
00:08:33 my room is like an icy tomb, so I'm just like sitting there in a cold embrace. You gotta love
00:08:37 that, that healthy rhythmic sound of a heartbeat that sounds like, that's the sound of a healthy
00:08:44 heart right there, for sure. I gotta say, Duvou, relevant to the rainy mood, I do owe quite a bit
00:08:50 of sleep in my life to the website, or rather type rain fire jazz onto Google, and you'll get this,
00:09:00 it's like a mute this play, or a play these together thing, where it'll play a video of rainfall,
00:09:05 a video of like a burning fire in a fireplace, and then a video of the song, the smell of black coffee
00:09:14 from Phoenix Wright, like the jazz version. Oh yeah. I actually found a three hour video,
00:09:22 which was most relaxing jazz music, and it was just that on loop for three hours. Yeah,
00:09:27 that's lazy. And if you're on this, on this website, it just keeps looping those things forever,
00:09:32 so I've had like times where I've listened to like 48 hours of just that song over rain and fire
00:09:40 all day. The only time a YouTuber is allowed to cry is when it's all over, so one time,
00:09:47 so I found out about white noise, and maybe some of you guys, maybe some of you guys have
00:09:54 back we have, I don't know if DeVoo would, but from the oblongs, anybody remember the oblongs?
00:10:00 I remember, not that well. What was this? I don't know. It was an adult swim show.
00:10:05 No, I know the show, I don't know what you're talking about specifically. It's not one of the
00:10:08 adult swim shows that anyone cares about or remembers. It only had like, it only had 10 episodes,
00:10:15 but they would replay them like. Bob Oblong was an inspirational character, he was the coolest
00:10:20 dude with no limbs. But there's an episode where basically the concept of the episode is that
00:10:27 the Milo doesn't realize this, but the only way he's able to get to sleep is because of the sound
00:10:33 of his parents fucking in the room next to him. Oh, I remember that. Yeah. And so the two of them
00:10:38 start fighting and Milo can't get to sleep. So someone tells him that he needs to start using
00:10:44 white noise, so he just starts turning on like every appliance in the house, like running water
00:10:49 and turning on all this other shit. And then it ends up flooding the house. And then that ends up
00:10:55 being how they tie the plots together, because once he floods the house, then the parents,
00:10:59 you know, like have to work together to save their kids. And it makes them rekindles their
00:11:04 marriage and they start fucking again. I remember that I actually kind of, I didn't really, it was
00:11:09 one of those messages that was like supposed to be heartfelt, but rub me the wrong way because
00:11:12 the message was like, okay, we're married, we'll stay together, not because we really like each
00:11:17 other, but because we've got our kids. All right, all right. So well, fuck that. I don't care.
00:11:24 So like with rain, interestingly enough, one time I was like in a hotel with my brother and my dad,
00:11:29 and I put on some rain. I thought, yeah, I'm all into this rain stuff now. And my dad was like,
00:11:33 I can't sleep with this because it makes me want to get up and shut a window. I can't live with
00:11:38 this rain. But if you're not getting wet and you hear the rain, it's just okay. But sounds like
00:11:42 outside rain. Yeah. And like, I remember getting a whole app from my phone that has a huge collection
00:11:49 of white noise things, including the sound of a dripping faucet. Like who the heck is that gonna
00:11:54 keep us sleep? There's also typing, the sounds of typing. You know, until until recently, I never
00:12:00 got into any of this white noise shit, except in college, me and my buddies did love just
00:12:05 vegging out to Bob Ross for like hours on it. We would watch him. We would literally sit there
00:12:10 and do nothing, say nothing, just watch Bob Ross paint shit. We watched like seasons after season
00:12:16 after season of this game. It was awesome. Guys, were you were you were you fucking high bro?
00:12:23 You know it my dude. Who do you mean dog? Yo, Bob, go green dog. Go man. You know what,
00:12:28 since we're never I'm never gonna find another time to do this. An anecdote about when I was
00:12:33 watching Bob Ross when he was being streamed on Twitch, and there were dozens of people who were
00:12:37 acting like he was doing it live. And I don't know if they were joking or not. The people were
00:12:41 like, oh, you should paint this differently. And then someone said paint rainbow dash please.
00:12:46 And that's always stuck in my mind is the funniest thing ever. So hilarious. Let's see. I want to
00:12:52 Bob Ross, you Bob Ross, this landscape is real nice, but we're going to need some rainbow dash in
00:12:55 there. We're just gonna need to complete this this work. So I don't know if we want to bring up
00:13:01 ASM markers, but that's like a whole separate podcast we've been planning for a while. We can
00:13:04 touch on it a little bit. I would say that I find it really weird and bizarre. And when I see
00:13:10 everyone says that until they actually understand. Most people don't like it. Well, that's because
00:13:16 they're idiots. Why do these people have billions of views and I don't know whatever. The some of
00:13:21 us like ASMR, some of us don't. I like putting on something to listen to. Sometimes I like having
00:13:27 someone talking when I go to sleep. But like, I don't know this. I've maybe I just haven't been
00:13:32 in the right mindset. But when I've put on the ASMR and like listen to like a guy talking real
00:13:36 close to my ear about, I don't know, whatever object he's holding or whatever it is that they do,
00:13:41 it's, it's, I don't know. It's like, okay, you know, I'm not going to do too much. I'm not going
00:13:46 to go into too much, but I just want to say that it's a whole world of stuff out there. And not
00:13:50 everybody even likes to hear human voices. That's why there's a whole bunch of stuff that's just
00:13:53 like tapping or like, I will it's because because Ben clear is being ignorant and he thinks that
00:13:59 ASMR is just a bad voice. You literally are ignorant. And that's okay. Yeah, I'm just
00:14:04 clarifying about it. I mean, I don't know. I'm just saying there's there's stuff for everybody
00:14:09 theoretically. I mean, maybe people don't like any of it. But I know for a fact,
00:14:12 you haven't seen all that there is. So you guys say, oh yeah, I'm going to go watch every ASMR
00:14:17 video ever made and fucking browse back to talking about yeah, whatever. To be continued. I'll kill
00:14:24 you guys. Do you actually though, listen to ASMR to get to sleep? Has it helped you? Absolutely.
00:14:31 Absolutely. Yeah, I mostly listen to music and there's like, oh, I can't do that. That like,
00:14:36 like flood by Boris. And like these days, death consciousness by have a nice life. And I always
00:14:43 end up putting on death consciousness because of the fact that I've never stayed awake through
00:14:47 the whole thing if I listen to it when going to bed. So like, I think clearly it's it's
00:14:51 Victor. It's having victory over me. Now it is an 85 minute album. So that's probably part of it.
00:14:58 I was going to talk. I was going to explain like how I get myself up. So like nowadays,
00:15:03 what I do is I have two tracks going at once. I have an ASMR video just like one or maybe two
00:15:09 that are shorter. Two tracks at once. So they get like, so they get like 30 minutes of ASMR.
00:15:14 Then I have like music going on. And then after like an hour of relaxing music,
00:15:19 it's like six hours of rain. So I like put the song on a playlist. I could take like an hour
00:15:23 and a half rain in stuff like that before. Yeah, rain from inside a car for 90 minutes,
00:15:30 which is awesome. That's a great. I love that sound. Like put down like four of those. And then
00:15:36 the tent is the best. That's a good one. That's a good. I like that sound. Now it's raining in
00:15:40 the car is my favorite to sleep. I can't get to sleep when camping because of the sea. I don't
00:15:46 I don't actually like that either. I just don't. It doesn't work as well like on YouTube because
00:15:51 like you can tell it's coming from a speaker because it's coming from one direction. Right.
00:15:56 Well, did you ever be saying that like rain is not relaxing for you? It gives you a headache?
00:16:01 What? No, literal rain, like not the sound of it. So I just imagine that that artificial rain
00:16:06 makes you think of headaches, right? This was only a recent thing. Like in the last couple years,
00:16:11 I started getting low pressure headaches where anytime there's like a strong low pressure front
00:16:17 coming through, then I'll start getting headaches. Oh, man. Sometimes when I detect a small change
00:16:22 in air pressure, I imagine that like the media has hit and like just to smash the earth's atmosphere
00:16:29 off and that like this is it. Like the earth is over. And I look out the window expecting to see
00:16:34 like a huge mushroom cloud. Oh, man, how do you wait? More and the sky torn open by like some
00:16:40 cosmic catastrophe. And I'm like, okay, I'm with you. I'm with you. But how do you detect a change
00:16:45 in pressure? Exactly. Like you can feel it in your ears. You feel that? Oh, okay. All right. In regards
00:16:51 to dreams and like destruction of the world, I remember one time like I woke up. Oh, Jesus,
00:16:56 into the dreams we go. All right. No, just short one. I had a dream. I had a dream that I woke up
00:17:02 and my brother was with me and I looked up into the sky because for some reason there was a giant
00:17:06 window on my ceiling and I saw that the moon had just exploded and like a whole bunch of
00:17:11 fragments of it. You realize you were playing Sonic Adventure 2 and Shadow showed up and you
00:17:16 went on a Rolla Keeg adventure through Edgeland. No, like the whole moon. The whole moon just
00:17:19 got exploded and I pulled out my camera, my phone, which is right next to me and I recorded it and
00:17:24 I'm like, oh man. Like an assassination classroom. Yeah. And then I woke up and I was like, oh my
00:17:30 gosh, I'm so glad that was just a dream. But I got it on tape. Oh wait, no. That's my favorite part.
00:17:36 But I recorded my dream. That's my favorite part when you're still 50% dreaming afterwards. Like
00:17:41 one time I woke up but had a dream that my dad was yelling at me. But then that turned out to be fake.
00:17:45 No more dream descriptions. This is going to start a chain reaction. Yeah, I agree. I'm already thinking
00:17:50 of one. I just want to talk about what an idiot I am. That was it. All right. On a weirdly related
00:17:54 subject about recording dreams, I watched the movie Paprika the other day, which is all about this
00:17:59 machine that like lets you see people's dreams. And it really annoyed me that like, you know,
00:18:06 in the movie you watch someone's dream and like it's an anime. But then like the people that see
00:18:11 into the dreams with this machine, they see it on their screen and what they see is the exact same
00:18:16 anime footage that you, the viewer just watched. And it really annoyed me because like a dream
00:18:21 is not a fucking, a dream does not have like camera cuts and angles and like a dream is not,
00:18:27 is not composed in the way that an anime is. I understand that. I've been editing videos too long.
00:18:33 It just seems a reasonable, a reasonable way to handle portraying what you seem. Is it lazy maybe?
00:18:41 Is it like all stuff like that? Anytime that someone tries to represent something that would
00:18:47 not be experienced like a show as a dream. Dreams and fiction never seem like actual dreams except
00:18:54 for the one time that a dream in fiction was portrayed like an actual dream, like the dreams
00:19:00 that I have every night was when Chuckie says to Tommy, hey Tommy, what's going on here? And
00:19:08 Tommy turns around and he's got a clown face and he goes, I'm not Tommy! And then later in the episode,
00:19:17 Drew has the same dream. Or no, it's Chaz. Chaz has dream. Chaz is Drew. Drew is Angelica's dad.
00:19:24 What's he doing in the kitchen? And Stu turns around and he's a clown and he's like, I'm not Stu!
00:19:29 The theme here is that there's a lot of surprise clown faces in Jesse's dreams.
00:19:33 I have a lot of surprise clown face dreams and it all goes back to that fucking Rugrats episode.
00:19:40 That in ICP is responsible. Maybe the Rugrats grew up to be ICP because of that fucking dream.
00:19:46 That was a dark carnival visiting violent day in his dreams as an infant telling him to spread
00:19:52 the gospel of the Six Jokers cards and bring forth a new era of enlightenment. I'm not Stu!
00:20:00 So hey, let's just go back to freaking uh the playlists for to go to sleep to and how I like
00:20:06 to end them with a wake-up song. It's all about you, isn't it, DeVoo? It's all about DeVoo's plan.
00:20:09 He's got to get his shit out of his stupid playlist. I'm not DeVoo! Jesse, your interpretation of that
00:20:17 episode of the Rugrats is the plot of Homestuck, by the way. What? Is that true? Making me hate it more?
00:20:27 Only a little bit. Of course. Of course. Well, I like to go for, like, getting back to wake-up songs.
00:20:32 What the fuck, just wake it? DeVoo, you just gave me whiplash. You changed subjects so quickly.
00:20:39 DeVoo's good at that. All right, go on, DeVoo. Go. Wake, wake, wake, wake, wake-up song. Wake me up!
00:20:45 Wake me up! I can't wake up! Wake me up! Save me! Save me from the nothing I've become.
00:20:55 That should be our opening song. So yeah, like, you know, like ones that are just kind of chilled
00:20:58 out and start off, you know, just kind of kind of smoothly, you know, a lot of steely dance songs
00:21:03 are like that. I was going to say, like, immediately I thought of the what's, uh, do it again, just
00:21:10 Yeah.
00:21:12 Dude, there's too much happening in those songs to, I don't know, sleep to.
00:21:18 Although I like My Old School. That's a great song for that. I like ones that do get a little bit
00:21:22 more energetic, especially toward the end. There's also, there's also what's, oh, I don't understand this at all.
00:21:29 What does that do with sleep? This is totally unrelated. To our podcast, to our lives, to our friendship.
00:21:34 What happened? You know, it's a great, you know, it's a great video game about sleeping.
00:21:39 Roar of the Beast.
00:21:40 You mean, yeah, let's talk about Yume Nikki. That is a great video about sleeping.
00:21:42 Yume Nikki is this, is this RPG maker game. It's 2D Spray Graphic. It's about this girl,
00:21:48 this, this Hikikomori, this Japanese girl who won't leave a room under any circumstances and
00:21:53 all she does, all you can do as her is you go to your bed and go to sleep and like record
00:21:58 things in your dream diary. That's what the title means. Yume Nikki means dream diary.
00:22:02 What? Who's trying to interrupt me?
00:22:03 Sorry, I just got cut out for like 20 seconds there.
00:22:06 Oh, okay. Well, you're missing some gold here. Anyway, you go to sleep as this girl and you
00:22:12 wander around these crazy dream scapes and you find all these objects and these like
00:22:17 abilities and you can do stuff and you find a knife and you can stab things.
00:22:20 I remember that. That's right, because you know, actually won the competition the first time and
00:22:23 went back in time to make Yuki win the competition. I remember that.
00:22:28 That's Mirai Nikki and Yume Nikki is way better.
00:22:31 You know, you know, I really love Yume Nikki. I love the way that everything is super fucked up
00:22:38 and it's not at all like, like you were saying before, like the portrayal of like
00:22:43 dreams is just like a flat anime. That's really boring and I don't give a shit,
00:22:47 but Yume Nikki is like this big crazy world where shit, you don't know what the fuck is
00:22:51 going to happen and you can like interact with things in weird ways and you like collect items
00:22:55 and fuck with things. It's just, it's really out there and it's the best. Everyone's watching
00:22:58 this has probably already seen or played Yume Nikki. If you haven't do it, yeah, I would hope
00:23:03 so. It's one of those, it's one of those few like RPG maker games that has kind of reached
00:23:10 not mainstream success, but is like known by audience. It's definitely a cult, a very cult.
00:23:15 Yeah, yeah. I guess so. I mean the places I hang out, everybody knows about it. It's up there with
00:23:19 off and space funeral. I think it's not quite up to snuff with my RPG maker game, the classic
00:23:26 which is unreleased, which is one screen of me walking up to a tree and going, fuck that tree.
00:23:35 Alright, slow down. Please, please. Another great RPG maker game, Master of the Wind, if
00:23:39 anyone wants to play Master of the Wind. Why the fuck are we talking about video games? This is
00:23:41 a sleep cut game. Yume Nikki is a game about sleeping and it's fucking cool. The only real
00:23:48 point I wanted to make here has been ruined. No one's going to take it seriously anymore because
00:23:53 it's like, I was about to finish it and then I got cut out of the freaking chat.
00:23:57 Well, give it a try. Okay, so wake up songs. Here's the thing. Ever since I started using those,
00:24:02 waking up has been finally a good experience for the first time in my life because what I realized
00:24:08 is that no matter what you set to your phone to wake you up, it's coming out of your phone. It's
00:24:12 unpleasant. It has to be like all the way up on the volume in order to register and it sucks. But
00:24:17 you get a nice wake-up song and it's like, man, waking up. I can wake up inside, finally.
00:24:25 They really called my name and saved me from the dark. It was awesome.
00:24:31 Hot dog. I don't typically wake up to anything. I don't set alarms for myself. I just kind of
00:24:38 wake up when I do. I'm curious for you guys because I know everybody's a different kind of
00:24:44 quote unquote morning person or non-morning person. For me personally, I have, I struggle to actually
00:24:52 wake up, like I'll lay there and just be like in and out of awakeness until I finally make up my
00:24:58 mind and I'm like, okay, I'm getting out of bed. But then once I'm out of bed, it's just like zero
00:25:03 to a hundred. There's no like groggy, I need coffee. I have an extremely groggy morning
00:25:10 thing. I'm not a morning person at all. I can't say for sure, like recently whether or not I'm
00:25:16 a morning person because I'm not used to like having to be up anyway. So whenever I wake up,
00:25:20 even if it's the morning, I've probably slept enough because I just wake up naturally. Yeah,
00:25:23 same here. But back when I did have to fucking get up for stuff years ago, I remember that like my
00:25:29 girlfriend would try to get me out of bed. And according to her, because I have very blurry
00:25:34 recollection of these moments, I would turn into a fucking savage animal, the likes of which humanity
00:25:41 was not prepared for. And I would just turn into like Wolverine Berserker rage. The things that I
00:25:47 would do in my mind to just putting holes in her face, knocking her teeth out, slapping her around
00:25:55 a bit, slapping her tits around, throwing the bed upside down, throwing the bed on her, trapping
00:26:00 her under it, setting the house on fire. The willingness as I run into the night in my tidy
00:26:06 whitey. Yeah, the sheer ferocity with which my sleeping, my sleepy self attempts to defend not
00:26:13 getting up is covered in scat. That's that's how Victor is when I try to wake him up. Victor gets
00:26:23 really violent and angry with me if I wake him up for anything. I'm the same. Unless it's lunch,
00:26:29 in which case I can coax him into like, because this is when I walk into Victor's room in the
00:26:34 morning, he's usually like just in the process of waking up. And he looks at me with this scowl,
00:26:38 and he goes, what? And I'm like, I'm like, want to go to lunch. And he sits there and like processes
00:26:45 it for a bit, like trying to figure out if he has money. Well, I can sympathize with that because
00:26:50 from the way you describe your life and from some of the videos I've seen on your after dark channel,
00:26:54 it seems like your life is just you walking into your sibling's rooms randomly. Yeah, that's
00:27:01 pretty fucking their girlfriends. Like it seems like if you're not editing videos, all you do is
00:27:06 wander around your house in a fucking Applejack shirt and pajama pants cut off at the knee and go
00:27:13 someone take me to fucking take me to cook out. I can promise you Victor's listening to this right
00:27:21 now clapping his hands and standing up like giving you a standing ovation for the exact
00:27:26 miss of that. You know, it's been a bit like that historically when I've had to wake him up for
00:27:30 things. Oh, you know you have been you know you have you've been a kill you Nate. I mean,
00:27:36 it's just because your sleep schedule you always go to bed later than later than everybody else
00:27:40 when we were you know, picturing like this slimy amorphous, like fucking,
00:27:46 like, I was gonna say like Aldrich rising in the coffin, amorphous fat like losing
00:27:53 under Victor's door. You can't close the door. You can't keep him out. He's coming under the cracks.
00:27:58 This is exactly how Victor imagines Victor Victor is the Gwendolyn to Digi's Aldrich just
00:28:06 fucking seeping into the orifices, possessing him and using him for his pleasure. There's a reason
00:28:12 that whatever Victor does like an impression of me. It's always like
00:28:27 you know, my brother, I think is more of a morning person than me. But what's cool about
00:28:30 waking him up is that he lives in the basement, right? It's very dark.
00:28:34 Wake me up. Wake me up inside. Wake me up. Wake me up. I want to hear what I want my brother's
00:28:41 story to do. I don't care. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Every time I hear those words, I have to. Okay,
00:28:46 go on. Go on. So he's in the basement on the far end. And like, like if you go down to the steps,
00:28:51 he's on the other end of the basement, right? Don't go in the basement, man. Arl Stein, he told
00:28:55 you. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Yeah, the base under the directly under the light. And he
00:29:01 he lays on his back. And so he's just it's so dramatic because the basement's so dark with
00:29:05 the light descending upon him. And it just makes me want to like slowly walk up to him and like
00:29:10 grab a key or something. It's like, it's just so epic. Like one time I woke, I tried to get him up.
00:29:15 And I didn't even want to wake him up because he was so glorious, just like, like just laying
00:29:19 there with a very, very stoic face. I brought my whole family down like, Hey, guys, look at
00:29:24 I invited the neighbors over to check this shit out. It was awesome. We got the community involved.
00:29:30 Isn't that the plot of Totoro? Didn't she get us like, find him sleeping there in this meadow
00:29:36 and like go get her friends to go check out Totoro? Look at this majestic animal.
00:29:47 Fuck. Hey, let me tell you guys, here's something that I can't decide how I feel about
00:29:52 people who can just fall asleep by accident. I don't think I don't think I've yeah, like, like
00:29:58 just fall asleep watching a movie. I have, I don't think I've ever in my life fallen asleep
00:30:02 without meaning to. I've never like sat down and like fallen asleep in the middle of a movie.
00:30:08 You never like decide like, I'll try to watch a movie and then you just like
00:30:13 never. Never. I've only done that all the time. And I would make me jealous sometimes. We would
00:30:19 be up watching adult swim as youngins and you would like pass out. And I'd be like, Nate,
00:30:23 you're missing the anime. I remember that. I remember. I hated doing, I wanted to watch those
00:30:27 goddamn animes. I was robbed. I would have to be like exceedingly exhausted to pass out during a
00:30:33 show or like with adult swim, though, I would always pass out during the one show I didn't
00:30:38 really care about. And that's the one, like I couldn't make it to my favorite shows because
00:30:42 I'd pass out during the one that like I that was boring, like fucking pilot candy. You know,
00:30:46 I've always been a really heavy sleeper and it's always been pretty easy for me to fall asleep.
00:30:50 But yeah, I don't know. I'd fall asleep during anything when I got fucking late.
00:30:54 Fucking shade. I mean, shade. I once saw shade fall asleep on the top stair of the stairs.
00:31:03 He was like going up on his way down. He's like five or six years old. No, on the top. Like he
00:31:08 he walked up to the top of the stairs and then just passed out on the top of the stairs.
00:31:13 I could. I might have done. He also cannot stay awake in a car. Like if you're in the car for
00:31:18 more than five minutes, he will absolutely pass out to this day. 18 years old and still
00:31:24 passes out from like when you guys have that thing. Falling asleep is difficult for me. It
00:31:28 requires it requires focus and effort. It's weird. It's tough for me to do. Speaking of sleeping
00:31:34 in a car because it's like if I'm in like a long car ride and I'm getting really tired, but I can't
00:31:39 quite get comfortable enough to fall asleep. I have these times where I like go into sleep for
00:31:42 like five seconds and I realized there was this lapse of audio and I'm like, whoa, it's like
00:31:48 that's cool. In fact, there's only one time where I actually fell asleep at a very specific moment
00:31:56 that I could remember and it was like instant. Like I went to some sort of camp thing for like a
00:32:01 whole day and I don't remember being ultra tired, but I literally just lay down face first on my
00:32:08 own bed with my mom right behind me with all my clothes on. And then my mom started taking off
00:32:13 my pants and then I fell asleep halfway through getting my pants. I wasn't listening to any of
00:32:19 that, but now I'm listening to all of it. Very incredible. Yeah. So like I'm like, I'm probably
00:32:25 like six or seven years old. You know, I was going to say one of the best ways to stop yourself from
00:32:29 falling asleep is to get a boner and boner achieved to continue with this mom taking off your pants
00:32:33 story. Yeah, I fell asleep halfway through getting my pants taken off, you know, and like my mom was
00:32:39 like, I didn't even like quite think about it until my mom was like, you fell asleep like
00:32:42 immediately. I'm like, oh my gosh. Yeah. I literally remember the feeling of my pants getting taken
00:32:49 off and then it cuts to black. And I'll bet the judge went easy on it because she was a woman.
00:32:56 Shameful. Fucking classic double standard. There's only one way I can regularly remember
00:33:03 exactly like or approximately when I fall asleep. And it's a great way for me to figure out how long
00:33:08 it took me to fall asleep. Flood by Boris as Digi mentioned before, which he got me into. It's
00:33:12 this one hour thing, this one like this one song that's also an album and it's just over an hour
00:33:17 long and it's awesome for sleep. Uh, is it wake me up? Wake me up. Come on. I guarantee they're loving
00:33:28 this. Yeah. So I am. And so like it has all these different sections. And so what happens is it,
00:33:34 you know, it varies at which section I fall asleep. And so all I mean, all I have to do is just
00:33:38 remember which segment I last heard, you know, and then I'm like, oh, that's exactly how long it
00:33:43 took me to fall asleep. That's really cool. Although I can't, you know, I want to bring up Flood again.
00:33:48 Like what happened to me? The other tool for Mario Sunshine. I, yeah. No, you, Eddie, Eddie is
00:33:52 talking about the album from They Might Be Giants. Stay with it. Oh, shit. I don't know. God.
00:33:59 All right. So like, uh, but like, yeah, like albums like Flood that did you got me into, like, I
00:34:05 think that really helped me get more into music for sleep. Wait, is that really what you were
00:34:08 talking about? Because I was just making a joke. It's a different Flood. It's a Flood by the band
00:34:13 Boris. You know that if you listen to any fucking time that we've been Boris, that Hawaiian shirt,
00:34:18 that Hawaiian shirt wearing fuck from GoldenEye, I told you, I hate that guy. Yeah, man. What
00:34:24 where does he get off ripping off album titles from a, from an American institution like They
00:34:28 Might Be Giants? Yeah, good question. But like there was this other album that did you got me into
00:34:33 called Ocean Songs by Dirty Three. And I listened to that one for sleeping a lot too. But then what
00:34:39 happened at some point is that suddenly I developed this aversion to any music that makes me emotional
00:34:44 and I can't do it. I can't handle it anymore. Like when I play Flood or Ocean Songs, I just get too
00:34:51 like afraid of the world. So now like the reason I like those albums for sleep is because I find
00:34:56 them completely unemotional. Like any song that's going to make me feel anything is going to be an
00:35:02 obstacle to fall into sleep. I would assume what they have like, okay, what they have though is
00:35:06 this sort of, they have this really like, really full emotion. It's like if emotions are colors
00:35:13 and you combine them all to make white, that's what Flood is like, you know, it just feels like
00:35:17 all the emotions. And it's just too much for me. That if you like, if you listen to it loud, then
00:35:22 yes, that's what I would say I feel. But if you listen to it like at one, which is how I listen
00:35:27 to music, you know, like the minimum volume, then I mean for bed, then I don't think it really conveys
00:35:32 all that much. I guess. But yes, now all I can listen to is like stuff that just feels like
00:35:38 elevator lobby music type stuff. That kind of thing is just like, that's truly unemotional.
00:35:43 And that makes you feel, all right, that's all I have to say about that.
00:35:45 I want to move into what I wanted to talk about this podcast. I decided I'd save this
00:35:51 for later, because I want to talk about it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're going to save it?
00:35:57 God damn it!
00:36:02 I think he thinks he's funny. He's laughing. He's laughing as though he's funny.
00:36:08 I'm laughing. He's pretty funny. Come on, guys. That's a good joke.
00:36:12 It's a really good joke, guys. I want to talk about getting rid of sleep.
00:36:19 Yeah. Sleep needs to stop. Sleep. No, not even transhumanism, because, all right, first of all,
00:36:26 I'm going to tell some stories and anecdotes and some weird science facts, all right?
00:36:30 First of all, weird science fact. Nobody knows why we sleep. The only scientific reason that's
00:36:37 been discovered is because we get tired. Well, there's one very good reason. You've got to eat
00:36:43 big and you've got to sleep big if you want to get big. That's important for that. I mean,
00:36:47 if you don't sleep, you die. Right. Well, we know that getting too tired will make you die.
00:36:54 But we don't know how sleep fixes that. It's the weight of all your sins, weighing down your
00:36:58 eyelids. Yeah, you need Jesus to take the wheel every once in a while, so you've got to sleep,
00:37:02 so that can happen. I think it's basically just a stress reliever. It's like we take
00:37:06 in too much information. We can't handle it anymore and we need to just fucking lay down.
00:37:10 But nobody really knows why. I think when I was growing up, I had this impression that sleep was
00:37:15 like a healing process. It's kind of like in RPGs, right? I still think of it that way. You lose
00:37:20 all your health and then you go sleep and your health is restored. But it doesn't, it's not.
00:37:24 It doesn't do anything. It's just you not thinking for eight hours. It's got to be really useful,
00:37:30 though. I mean, from an evolutionary standpoint, having to sleep is a huge
00:37:34 weakness to predators. So it's got to be useful or something. Well, here's the thing. We've also
00:37:38 figured out there already are. They have already, like for years now, had pills that will make you
00:37:46 not sleep. Oh, bullshit. I don't believe this. They have had them. That was, they exist. Okay,
00:37:52 there's got to be an asterisk on that. And there's also, there are people out there who just don't
00:37:57 sleep. Yeah, if you take enough boner pills, you won't sleep as a side effect, but that's not the
00:38:02 main purpose of the drug. No, the main purpose is to make your winner 10 feet long to let you
00:38:08 get fucking elephant in the face all the way up fucking drunk. I'm going to tell you about the most
00:38:15 jealous I've ever been of any story I've ever read. It was a Roger Ebert article where he was
00:38:21 talking about how he met, he was like hanging out at like some like party or something in like
00:38:27 Italy or some shit. And he meets this guy and this guy is like showing him around his place.
00:38:32 And he's got like just this insane amount of projects he's done. He has like all these old
00:38:37 cars he built and shit and like all this other like artwork he'd made and stuff. And Ebert was
00:38:42 like, how the fuck do you have time for all this? And the guy said, well, I don't sleep. And he was
00:38:47 like, I didn't believe him. But then he didn't seem to be lying. And there was no reason not to believe
00:38:53 him. And everyone around him corroborated it. The guy just didn't sleep. And he got so much stuff
00:38:58 done by way he was just a fucking anomaly. I mean, it doesn't seem that weird, right? Like,
00:39:04 I believe that there's a human out there who's like, why we sleep, then how hard would it be
00:39:08 to believe that some biological anomaly of a person just doesn't do it? It's possible. It's
00:39:13 possible. There's a thing called the sleep diet that a lot of people do. And they say that it's
00:39:17 what Leonardo da Vinci and a bunch of weird people they were. And you don't take like an extended
00:39:21 sleep, but like you sleep in like six 20 minute naps. Yeah, there's a lot of there's the uberman
00:39:26 sleep schedule. The uberman is where you it's yeah, it's six 20 minute naps. There's you it takes
00:39:31 about 10 days to train yourself onto it. And it's gruelingly hard. I tried it. And I couldn't do
00:39:36 it. Look, I've been trying to fight sleep for years. I hate sleep. I want it gone. Biggest
00:39:42 problem in the universe. Every random idea that some internet fucking blogger has for how to sleep
00:39:47 less. I've tried it. And the problem is that there's nothing in my life that I can do to can
00:39:53 like to force myself to not sleep. Because like I have too much time to get everything done. So
00:39:59 like if I get tired, I'm just like fucking I'm just going to sleep. Like there's not like there's
00:40:04 nothing to I can say, oh, I'm going to get so productive. The only way to defeat sleep is to
00:40:09 just always be having the most fun you've ever had in your life. Because if I'm like really
00:40:14 having fun, I will not sleep for fucking ever. But the second I get bored, or even like a little
00:40:20 bit frustrated. I basically I sleep for an eternity. That's almost every like like you said earlier,
00:40:26 where it's like you only sleep when you feel defeated. Like that's yeah, that's my like,
00:40:30 I sleep. That's why it's so hard for me to reset my sleep schedule, because it'll happen naturally
00:40:35 if I find something to do all night. If I'm like, I'm going to make a list of my top 100 favorite
00:40:41 fucking asses in in Pokemon, then like is number one is number one. The Pokemon white
00:40:49 female trainer. He's got some thick ass thighs. But I if I get onto that, I can do that all night.
00:41:10 And like, it won't be until I can do the voodoo voice all night. Yeah, no, I can I can sit there
00:41:25 I can sit there and crack open a comic book and read all the character's voices in Guja voice
00:41:30 all night long. And and then I won't stop until I'm done. And then you won't stop out until you
00:41:37 are Guja. And that's when you start secreting underneath Victor's door. Oh, no, Conrad's
00:41:47 Guja again. He wants to hang out with me. What a fuck. I really hope that Guja becomes a meme,
00:41:56 Jesse. I've been doing that fucking voice all the time. It seems like everything that any of us
00:42:02 have said in the last 10 podcasts has become a meme. Yeah, we're kind of on a roll with the
00:42:08 self perpetuating memes. That's the best. We're a mean machine. We've always wanted to be.
00:42:16 Let me take the time to fucking complain and and bitch at all of our fans because they can't
00:42:22 read my mind sufficiently. And they're not they're not cool enough to understand what I say without
00:42:28 me explaining it or just or telling them honestly and forthrightly. I asked people to give me quotes.
00:42:35 Oh, yeah. Everyone gave me everyone gave me quotes that weren't the exact kind I was looking for.
00:42:39 Yes, I went on Twitter the other day and I was like, everyone tell me fucking memorable quotes
00:42:44 from all of the people. And like one, I only got quotes from like half of the PCP members. And
00:42:50 two, most of them were terrible because I had a specific thing in mind. Specifically, I was trying
00:42:54 to make an alignment chart and like chart everyone being chaotic evil. But you didn't tell anybody
00:42:59 that part. You just didn't tell anyone that. I thought it was obvious. I mean, what else would
00:43:05 I be looking for quotes for? What other possible reason could I have? I thought you were going to
00:43:08 make some kind of compilation. And then I was like, what the fuck is how can he possibly be
00:43:13 willing to go through all the episodes to find all these? Everyone was like, remember when when
00:43:19 Davoo is goo? And I'm like, you fucking idiot. That quote does not speak to any kind of moral
00:43:25 attitude whatsoever. I think Davoo Collective can be put on an alignment chart pretty easily.
00:43:31 He's got to be somewhere in the neutral. Yeah, something like that.
00:43:39 It didn't fit my artistic vision. I don't know. Are the Borg really neutral?
00:43:44 You know what? I want to actually go on a rant about alignments because I was thinking about this
00:43:48 last night. Okay. I was laying in bed and I was thinking about how nobody understands any superhero
00:43:53 but me. I'm the only one who gets these characters and everyone else should just not be allowed to
00:43:57 enjoy them. Okay. And I was thinking about how everybody always puts like Superman as lawful good
00:44:05 and Batman as chaotic good when really it should be reversed. Now Batman's like lawful. Batman is
00:44:11 lawful good because Batman has a code. Superman doesn't need a code. He's just a nice guy. They've
00:44:17 all got it backwards. Everybody, nobody understands. Superman is neutral good. Superman is neutral
00:44:22 good probably. Here's the thing. The alignments are way too simple and like I hate it when people
00:44:30 think that like you can actually box like a well-realized character into them. Like they're
00:44:36 meant as a simplification. Man, this sure is a great podcast about sleep. Get out of here.
00:44:42 So my favorite episode of American dad is the one where he gets the pills that make it so he
00:44:49 doesn't sleep anymore. Yeah. And he just becomes like his life becomes awesome and then his wife
00:44:54 starts doing all this shit and then the one guy at the end he smokes the cigarette and he goes
00:44:59 life. It's really funny. You know, that's not a real thing though. That was a work of fiction.
00:45:05 That was a science thing. I have read things that have said that there are actually anti-sleep
00:45:11 pills are not on the market yet, but they are. I have often heard that Vince McMahon is one of
00:45:16 these individuals that does not sleep. I've heard and it's been corroborated by numerous sources
00:45:22 that Vince McMahon sleeps like at most one hour a night for like the last 40 years and he's 70
00:45:28 years old and he's gonna live forever. He's doing fine. Yeah. And he's still chacked. And he's got,
00:45:33 well, okay, but he definitely did Roy's. I do enjoy the act of sleeping. Roy's come from Vince
00:45:40 McMahon. We just shaved them off of his skin. You know how the curse mark in Naruto came from
00:45:46 that one guy who was the origin of all the curse marks? He's that for Roy. Vince McMahon takes off
00:45:51 his skin mask and it's just a big giant steroid pill underneath. It was me, Austin. It was me,
00:45:58 Gudra. I was Gudra all along. I do like the act of sleeping, but not that much. I don't like
00:46:06 having to sleep that much. So like, I would like two to three hours every second to third day.
00:46:12 That would be perfect. Hey, you know what? You know what? I want to break this on a totally
00:46:16 different area of sleep. I hate sleeping with another human being in the bed. Typically a woman.
00:46:22 I find it disgusting. I can't sleep at all. It is in fear every time that I've done it,
00:46:28 which has been a lot. Let's keep it on level. We talked about this on Digibro. It's horrendous.
00:46:32 I was saying that I'm envious of the fact that Victor and his girlfriend will hang out late into
00:46:38 the night and then Victor would just go home to go to bed. That's what it's all about. There is
00:46:44 nothing wrong with, I just hate sleeping with other people. If they touch me, it's weird. I don't
00:46:49 like it. When you're married, it's an art form of figuring out how to never come in contact while
00:46:54 you're actually trying to sleep. 90% of the relationship is figuring out how you're actually
00:46:58 going to sleep in a bed with this person. It's horrible. People make fun of the Brady Bunch because
00:47:02 the parents had separate beds. I think they had to figure it out. They push those beds together
00:47:06 on the reg, my nigga. You know they do it, but then they go to sleep separately. Here's the
00:47:11 thing. I definitely, when I get married, want to have separate bedrooms because it's like,
00:47:17 when you think about it, the whole tradition is a social construct of having to share the same bed.
00:47:23 Social construct because they like this way. The Chinese don't do that shit. Back in the 1800s
00:47:27 or whenever, you know, didn't have any room. It was like one room for both the parents and then
00:47:33 another room for all seven of the kids. Then as houses got bigger, every single kid is going
00:47:38 to campaign for as much space as possible, but no married couples are going to want to be in
00:47:45 separate rooms because they'll look like they don't have as good of a bond as their friends do.
00:47:49 Yeah, I hear you on that too. It creates this artificial scarcity of rooms.
00:47:55 Expectation or something going on. You're really into that artificial scarcity phrase.
00:48:02 It's good phrase. It is a good phrase. I just can't get to sleep without jacking off at least once.
00:48:09 That doesn't help me at all. I'm just back where I started after I jacked off.
00:48:12 Well, it doesn't help me to get to sleep. It's more like I can't not jack off while on the
00:48:19 bed. And so even if I have firsthand experience that it doesn't matter if I have sex immediately
00:48:25 before bed, I will jack off 20 minutes later and trying to explain that to your girlfriend who's
00:48:33 sleeping next to you on the same bed. Why you're half of the, now mind you, I'm really good at
00:48:38 jacking off quietly and without moving too much. I know how to do it without having to shake the
00:48:44 bed and wake her up. You know, I'm pretty sure she was not even aware of half the times I was
00:48:48 jacking off sometimes in broad daylight right next to her. But you know, there's sometimes right
00:48:54 behind her face as she was cooking. Sometimes in the supermarket. How am I going to get behind
00:49:00 her face while she's cooking? You mean just like behind her? You gotta stand on a footsteller.
00:49:05 I mean, she said she was a giant anyway. But anyway, yeah, it's like,
00:49:13 like she would go to sleep and I'd be like, I can't, like I don't want to wake her up,
00:49:17 but I'm not, I can't get to sleep. And then like for me, I have this, like if I lay in bed for
00:49:21 like 40 minutes and it's not working, I get up and go do other stuff, you know. So I'd be like
00:49:26 laying in bed, like fucking awkwardly trying to be quiet. And of course she's not listening to music
00:49:31 or anything. She just fucking passed out. So I'm sitting there in silence, like, oh, fuck,
00:49:35 this is so weird. And then I get up, get on my computer, like a laptop, you know, watch anime
00:49:40 and shit, then jack off again, because I laid down again. So now I have to do that whole process
00:49:45 again stand over her and jack off on her and let you know, that's, you know, that's her responsibility
00:49:51 to accept that burden. Right. But yeah, it's just, you've got to jack off. She needs that
00:49:57 pitter-patter of raindrops to fall asleep. So you've got to jack off over her.
00:50:02 Actually, I do wonder if having a bunch of sound going on would fix a lot of that, because I feel
00:50:06 like if I had like, if I had to sleep with someone, I might just like, I might just like super
00:50:12 multi-layer it, like put on like the sound of rain, the sound of fire, like two ASMR videos,
00:50:18 a whole bunch of stuff, just to the point of-
00:50:19 One thing that relaxes me to sleep, like the sound of my boyfriend jacking it is like the
00:50:22 rhythmic thrumming of a mother's heartbeat in the womb.
00:50:26 That one's close. Hey, but you know, you know, I can't relate to needing to jack off before I go
00:50:31 to sleep, but I can relate in that I feel extreme anger at myself if I haven't jacked off during
00:50:37 the day when I go to sleep. It's like, I wasted my day. What was I doing this whole day if I
00:50:41 didn't jack off? So it's a wash, you know? Yeah. Nothing, nothing fills me with regret like that.
00:50:47 I actually, I surprisingly know what you mean, because like, I'll be going to bed and jacked
00:50:51 off. I lost, I lost a little bit of joy out of my life. Well, it's just because there's,
00:50:55 I feel like there's so much porn in the world that every day I don't jack off, it's like,
00:51:02 I've pushed back that like the tide has gotten away from me more. That's true. Like, you know,
00:51:07 like if I, if I jack off three times in the same day, and then it gets to a point where like,
00:51:12 I've seen everything on the couple, like everything new on the few sites I use, and I'm like, wow,
00:51:17 I'm like ahead of the curve for Jack. Like, I feel like this, to this current week of porn,
00:51:23 I've seen all of it, and I can check that off as like, in the historical context of porn,
00:51:28 there's a whole week where I know everything that came out that week. It's, it's such an
00:51:31 interesting, you know, it's such a telling insight into you, did you, that you think about porn in
00:51:35 the same way you think about like anime or like any of the media you're trying to consume. It's
00:51:39 just another art form to be consumed. Yeah. You're a beast. I have strong, I have strong regrets
00:51:46 that I can't do like porn analysis where I stand to date.
00:51:49 That you can't do porn analysis. You know, Cece's been talking about maybe doing some of that shit.
00:51:53 We need the, we need the, the pornographers do that.
00:51:56 Well, the problem with doing porn analysis is that it's all going to be the same. It's always
00:52:00 going to be like, and this, this picture is attractive because the line art curves in this
00:52:05 way. And that's what makes it odd, you know. Well, I mean, if you're, no, that's, that's dumb,
00:52:08 because I mean, if you look at just, just the one example is that, that Bane porn that, that
00:52:13 fucking like Pornhub did, that was like, I don't know. You don't know what I'm talking about?
00:52:19 God, it was this, it was this, like clearly the TV board on 4chan was responsible for making this
00:52:24 happen. It was like, there was just some porn where like this guy brings a chick home to his house.
00:52:28 His whole family is Bane, like his mom and dad.
00:52:32 How have they told you about this before? Wait, is the guy Bane too?
00:52:36 Yeah, they're all Bane. Everyone's Bane. Mom's Bane, dad's Bane, the kid's Bane.
00:52:40 Wait, is the girl Bane? The girl's Bane too. She puts on the mask and she becomes Bane.
00:52:46 Every line, every, every line of the script, like was a meme, was a TV meme. It was,
00:52:52 it was insane. And like, that's fucking fascinating. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen in my
00:52:57 life. So, uh, you know, go Google that. I don't, I don't know. Why is nobody doing episodic, uh,
00:53:02 vlogging of the sex factor? That's a great question. That's a really great question.
00:53:07 Literally all of my friends are watching it at this point. Yeah, that's, you know,
00:53:12 it's the new X-Hamster original series, which is literally a reality show about porn. It's,
00:53:19 it's like America's next top model, but for porn stars. Oh my, yeah. Do you have to make,
00:53:23 do you have to make porn? Yeah, they're all like upcoming, they're all like new people who are
00:53:28 trying to become porn stars. And there's like the male team and the women's team. And they're
00:53:33 trying to like, what's like the, what's like the challenge they have every week? It'll be like,
00:53:37 who can give the best advice or something. Yeah. No, they're trying to be actors. There's one,
00:53:43 in episode two, there was a part where they, it was just like a minor competition for the guy's
00:53:49 side where they all had to stand around this bathtub and they all had their dicks out. And
00:53:55 there's two women in the bathtub making out and whoever got an erection fastest would, uh, then
00:54:01 they would make his dick into a mold, like for a dildo. And it might do to a hero d protagonist
00:54:07 one, that shit. Clearly a one piece fan. Um, oh yeah, you're right. Hero d protagonist. I looked
00:54:14 into it. I looked into it. The d stands for danger. He's not actually one piece. You know,
00:54:17 you know, that's kind of thought in the way that it dehumanizes them. Oh yeah, it's great.
00:54:23 Something about dehumanization is very, is very attractive to me. I don't want to think about
00:54:28 the humans really like low budget, badly edited, uh, like reality show, but it feels just like
00:54:36 any other reality show aside from the fact that it's particularly badly edited. But, uh, like,
00:54:41 yeah, it's, uh, it is what it is. And we played a drinking game with it, me and my friends, just
00:54:47 like, uh, every time, like certain, like every time they show the logo or like show certain
00:54:52 characters, you have to drink or, uh, whatever. But yeah, it's, uh, by the way, Blair Williams,
00:54:57 Blair Williams is going the distance. Blair's going to win it. I'm calling her right now.
00:55:01 She's the champion. She's got the hunger. She's got the fire. She's got what it takes to win
00:55:05 this competition. So Blair sleep. Um, yeah, right. How many hours a day do you think Blair Williams
00:55:12 sleeps? Uh, man, I, uh, in eternity after each one of these sessions, she needs to recharge
00:55:19 because she brings such intensity to the competition. It's going to take months to recover. Yep.
00:55:24 Yep. I think we've all officially got our brains on porn now. Nobody's thinking about sleep anymore.
00:55:31 That's true. So I don't know. Should we wrap this up? Anybody got any more thoughts on sleep?
00:55:36 Let's want it to go away. They don't have sleep in Star Trek. I'm, uh, what? Of course they do.
00:55:43 No, they don't. They have those like, they have those pod things where they just like sit in it
00:55:46 and it'll like give them however much sleep they want. And then they have those in, um,
00:55:51 it's not true. They have those in, um, that, what's that anime with the, the Star Kingdom
00:55:56 and the Empire? Uh, Legend of the Galactic Heroes. They do have it in there. Yeah, don't they? Yeah.
00:56:00 Yeah. Good. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? I've never, I've watched The Tone of Star. I've
00:56:05 never seen these fucking pods. Everyone has quarters that they sleep in. Yeah, but they can also use
00:56:10 uh, the, the strings. Isn't there like a rest? I have never seen this shit. I remember there was
00:56:14 a part where like, like in between battles, right? Yeah, like when they're about to do something
00:56:18 that's going to take a long time, they'll like go into the pod and just like get the quick rest
00:56:22 or whatever. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, like they don't, they don't use them all the time. Yeah. But
00:56:26 they have them on, on the ships that crew members can jump into. What the fuck? Why did I not see
00:56:32 this shit? Star Trek about that. No, that's just some, that's a good thing. Uh, well, I'll have to
00:56:38 look into it, I guess. Here's the upside. I mean, I hate, I hate sleep. I wish I could stay awake
00:56:43 and work all the time. However, me too. I made a graph the other day about my motivation to work
00:56:48 and how it's, when I wake up, it's usually, it's like dirt at the bottom, but then like as the,
00:56:53 but the day gets closer and closer to being done, it like ramps up because I become desperate. I'm
00:56:58 like, oh my God, I haven't done anything today. That's fair. Uh, and so I guess, I do schedule
00:57:03 my whole day around, like I do like structure how I'm going to start the day very specifically,
00:57:08 like oftentimes if I'm working on a video, uh, I'll have my bed scooted right up next to my desk
00:57:13 and my, I don't have like a bed frame, so it goes underneath my desk nicely. Wake up, um,
00:57:18 I, I wake up and then I was just waiting for an interruption there. Um, and feel just fine
00:57:25 your face. Oh, and so then the first thing I do is like I make one edit, like, like the first thing
00:57:32 I do is I'll like, you know, there, I just did one edit, you know, and that way when I go to the
00:57:40 bathroom and get breakfast or talk to people, I am taking a break from editing rather than waiting
00:57:46 for the moment at which I start working on editing. So I do a lot of work. In fact, actually,
00:57:50 what I did yesterday or this morning was I was trying to finish this anime and so I put the next
00:57:56 episode of it as, um, my wake up song because it was Gonkotsuo, the Count of Monte Cristo in OP for
00:58:02 that is a really nice song to wake up to. I can't imagine waking up and immediately trying to process
00:58:08 it. Subtitle. Well, you were watching dubbed, but you're really onto something there though with
00:58:12 like the doing a little bit of work right away. I mean, like more artists than I can even count
00:58:17 say that like, you know, you just got to do like a war like when you wake up, you got to do like a
00:58:22 warm up sketch to get in the fucking zone. You got to like bang out like one or two real quick ones.
00:58:26 So you're in like a drawing mindset and like I'm sure that applies to others. You know, I've been
00:58:30 doing that a little bit too, Davoo, but you've reinvigorated my desire to do that to sort of
00:58:35 force yourself into it. Good advice. I just kind of wake up and immediately watch like all the YouTube
00:58:40 videos. That's like the first thing I do. I mean, I'm, I've been in the habit of like getting up
00:58:46 and then I go on Twitter and I checked to Pastic for any messages and I check my email and I
00:58:50 look at my Tumblr and I just, and like sometimes it really fucks me up because like before I'd know
00:58:55 it like six hours of gunfire. Yeah, fucking around on social media. Definitely always like the first
00:59:01 hour or two after I wake up are usually like just reading and responding to comments and like
00:59:08 watching every YouTube video that's come out. And sometimes if a lot of long ones have come out
00:59:13 and I just don't think about it, I will end up sitting there for like hours. And the only upside
00:59:18 to that kind of is that I won't eat like I won't think to eat for that time. So like I'm convinced
00:59:26 that the only way that I keep my weight in check is that I sleep so much and I forget to eat any
00:59:31 time I get into something like, you know, sleep for eight hours, wake up, sit on the internet for
00:59:36 two hours and then realize you're hungry and like, I don't know, seems like a good weight loss.
00:59:40 Whoa, hey, Ben's, I just happened to open Twitter because Ben suggested, I just saw that
00:59:45 Idol Yo-Kai did the draw cast, the first Pokemon draw cast, you just drew all the Pokemon.
00:59:50 Way to go, dude. Nice work. They look beautiful. Shout out to you, Idol Yo-Kai. Anyway, yeah,
00:59:57 they're awesome. Let's wrap this bad boy up, shall we? Anyone else got anything to say?
01:00:01 Yes, I got to say, go to the Procrastinator subreddit, r slash the Procrastinators,
01:00:07 because I don't know if everyone knows about it, because we were talking about-
01:00:10 Oh, I don't think we've ever mentioned it on-
01:00:12 Yeah, I think we got to get people on there, because you know, I'm sure some people have some
01:00:16 degree in which they're thinking, man, if only there was a place where I could follow everything
01:00:20 that the TPC people do. Well, you're-
01:00:22 No, I use it myself, like I log on there and I check the fucking r slash the Procrastinators.
01:00:29 Yeah, hello, Reddit. Did you know that Harry's Razors, they loved these Razors so much,
01:00:34 they bought the factory that makes the Razors. No, I'm serious. Like, I log on to the subreddit
01:00:41 to see if any of you guys have released any videos. Oh, yeah, that's cool.
01:00:45 Because I don't want to ask in the chat, because you guys aren't always online and like-
01:00:50 And this subreddit is not only for a way to exhaust it.
01:00:54 And let rival Steven take care of it for me.
01:00:55 All songs that these people make are posted on here. Because that's one thing, is that not
01:01:01 everyone is able to follow all of the sound clouds of Jesse and Digi and so on. But all of the songs
01:01:06 that are made are also posted here. And best of all, all of the fan art that people draw is posted
01:01:12 immediately to the subreddit. So you can- Not all of it? Do you not-
01:01:16 Well, hopefully all of mine. I mean, I get like two or three a day.
01:01:21 Hmm, I see. Just whatever rival Steven has to catch.
01:01:23 Well, we encourage anyone who follows him on Twitter, just feel free to post it there anyway.
01:01:27 All right, that's enough. And he also not nearly all of our videos,
01:01:30 because not all my after dark stuff gets posted there, I don't think.
01:01:34 Oh, man. Guys, you gotta help out. Because like, rival Steven is this guy who stood up to the
01:01:39 challenge and has been posting almost everything. But you guys can do it, too. Do our bitch work
01:01:44 for us, please. Thank you very much. Yeah, please and thank you. Okay, and with that,
01:01:49 we're done. Wrap it up for the day. Thank you for watching this week of the faux-po-cast,
01:01:53 this thing. Thanks again. We'll see you next week. Everybody say goodbye. Bye.
