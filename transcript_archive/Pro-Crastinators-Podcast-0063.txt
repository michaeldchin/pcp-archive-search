00:00:00 If you're interested in changing your gender, then you are considered a transgender person.
00:00:04 That means you are either biologically a man who identifies as a woman, or a biologically
00:00:08 born woman who self identifies as a man. Some transgender people have expressed
00:00:12 feeling uncomfortable with their biological body. For example, a biological woman wishing
00:00:17 she didn't have breasts. Reading and hearing about the experience of transgender people
00:00:21 might connect with you or help you understand your own internal feeling. Some transgender
00:00:25 people have felt like they were transgender as far back as they can remember. Others
00:00:28 started identifying as transgender later in life.
00:00:31 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast,
00:00:35 an intimate small session today with me, your favorite guy, the best guy ever, and Mumkey Jones.
00:00:44 Hey, finally an episode where I can actually say I respect all of the cast members of the podcast.
00:00:51 I wouldn't go that far myself. And also, Endless Jess is here.
00:00:54 The only episode where I can say I respect one member of the podcast.
00:01:01 Congratulations, Nate. You did it.
00:01:04 I did it, guys. I did it. Well, and that's it, everybody. That's it. Just the three of us today.
00:01:09 Everybody else is off doing more important things. We're left in the trenches to carry
00:01:16 the sink and ship as far as we can. I was going to say with the three amigos,
00:01:21 but based on this topic, we might be the three of me guzz.
00:01:27 Impressive. You're welcome.
00:01:28 And if you can tell from that extremely cryptic hint, we're talking about gender swapping today.
00:01:34 Gender swapping. You can only refer to me as my new name on this episode, Estrogen Jess.
00:01:44 Good. Okay, I'll be Mumket, I think, is what we decided.
00:01:49 Yep, that's a good one. And I'm going to be Best Gal Ever, which is short for Best Gal
00:01:54 Godot Ever, because I identify as killing two Palestinian children in the Israeli defense
00:01:58 force. There you go. The one true meme has returned. The only funny joke from that overly
00:02:05 long, terrible Marvel DC podcast. Yeah, but it won't really hit. I won't really fucking hit.
00:02:11 Munchie did it again. Okay, let's fucking get into it, I guess.
00:02:15 Speaking of Mumket, remember when the Alvin and the Chipmunks, they had the Chimpettes,
00:02:20 and they were like, yeah, I do.
00:02:25 This is where we're going. Just the excess pre-edit side, when I mentioned the Chimpettes.
00:02:31 That's all I need to say. That's all you need to say about the Chimpettes.
00:02:36 The only good thing about that film franchise was that Jason Lee played the main guy, and then
00:02:41 in the second movie, he was like in the hospital the whole time. They wrote him out of the movie,
00:02:45 but not for the first 10 minutes, and I don't know why they made that choice.
00:02:50 Maybe they just only had so much money to pay for his time.
00:02:53 Yeah, because Jason Lee is so fucking expensive. The guy from My Name Is Earl is a hot ticket in
00:02:58 Hollywood. No wonder they called the squeakwell, because without Jason Lee, it's just a tepid
00:03:02 little fart of a movie squeaking through the butt cheeks of Hollywood's tight sphincter,
00:03:08 too tight to dish out that money for Jason Lee.
00:03:13 So this topic is so shit that I could find nothing related to it on Urban Dictionary.
00:03:23 Like, I tried searching gender-bending, gender-swapping. Let's just read gender.
00:03:27 Isn't it rule 63? Is the internet rule about gender-swapping?
00:03:33 That's true. That's true. Okay, let's see. Okay, rule 63. All right, that works.
00:03:38 Rule 63 is a rule of the internet that reads as follows. For any given male character,
00:03:43 there is a female version of that character. This rule's exceptions are only in-oh,
00:03:47 this is fucking-who gives a shit for whatever. Only in the instance that A,
00:03:50 the male character is already so androgynous that a female version would be basically the same,
00:03:54 or B, the female version hasn't been drawn yet. Well, why would you even write that?
00:03:59 Just fucking-this is shit. This is terrible. This is absolute garbage.
00:04:04 Hey, so the chimp bets, those Alvin and the chipmunk girls, they remind me.
00:04:13 What they remind me of is how incredibly hot female versions of characters that you already
00:04:18 like are. That's what you guys agree. I'll buy this premise. That's true. Would you say it?
00:04:27 I mean, like when I see a female version of Kymina, for example, I find that extremely arousing.
00:04:35 Oh yeah, like the girl from that cosplay girl who yelled at you. That's the hottest
00:04:39 comment I've ever seen. She's great, dude. 10 out of 10. It's because you got all the great
00:04:45 things about a character, but then you also can sex them now, which is just great.
00:04:52 Which is just great. It works the other way as well, I guess. If you've got a cool female
00:04:56 character, that's nice. But when you gender swap them, you can project all the things you like
00:05:01 about them from their, I guess, female version. And then also, now they can be-they can drive well.
00:05:07 Now they can drive-got them. I've got to say, when me and Mage did our Naru cast,
00:05:14 she drew a picture of me as Naruto and her as Sasuke. So we have this female Sasuke.
00:05:19 It's pretty much Sasuke with purple hair and tits. And like you're saying with the chimp
00:05:25 bets, I jerked off to that picture Mage drew probably 30 times in one day. It's just-it makes
00:05:30 the character so much hotter. I agree. Well, okay. That's one-
00:05:38 The podcast, everyone. We'll be collecting our fat three-person check now. Goodbye.
00:05:45 That's one facet thoroughly explored. This is what happens when you got three people. Okay,
00:05:49 but here we go. There's another facet, and it's the personally gender swapping thing, right?
00:05:54 So there's wanting to be the little girl, as it were. The Digi Bro complex.
00:06:01 Yeah. Yeah. Which, can you say why Digi's not on this episode? Because I imagine a lot of people
00:06:05 in the comments are angry that of this topic, of all topics, Digi should be here.
00:06:10 Yeah, that's true. Here's what happened. So we said, hey, Digi, do you want to come on?
00:06:12 He said, fuck you guys. Fuck the PCP. I'm too big for that shit. I have 300,000 subs now.
00:06:18 You're all beneath me. And that's why he's gone on. Did he cross that? Did he get the 300,000 now?
00:06:23 By the time this is out, he probably will. Okay, well, Greg, congrats, Digi, congrats.
00:06:30 Also, we hope to Voo. I hope to Voo would be here too, but he's busy as well. So this is what
00:06:35 you left with folks. Enjoy. The table scraps of the PCP. So I want to be the little girl.
00:06:47 And by that, I mean, I would definitely, I see a lot of perks. There's obviously some negatives,
00:06:52 but I see a lot of perks in being a sexy girl. I do have friends though, because if I was a girl,
00:07:01 you'd know I'd be a 10 out of 10 goddess, of course. It's a given. It's just a mirror image of
00:07:06 yourself, but with tits. That's right. That's right. So there's a lot of good things about that.
00:07:13 I guess I'm making, I'm taking this literally, I'm taking this like real, like if I was just
00:07:16 suddenly a girl in society, there's a lot of good things about being a girl, but there's
00:07:20 definitely some negatives. For example, wait, wait, time out. There's negatives to being a girl
00:07:26 in society. I don't think that holds any water, Nate. Name one. Well, I've got a friend who...
00:07:33 Okay, too far. Again, you're saying crazy things. I know. I've got a friend who's super hot and she
00:07:39 works in like customer service and just like, she was just telling me the other day, all the time
00:07:44 people will come up to her like, you know, men and they will, you know, want to have sex with her.
00:07:49 So what that manifests as... What a tragic life she must live. Being attractive.
00:07:55 Well, imagine if all the dregs of society kept coming up to you with the clear intention of
00:07:59 wanting to fuck you and it's like, yeah, okay, cool. Appreciate the compliment, but...
00:08:04 Not to get off on a gender dynamics tangent here. I think it's unavoidable, but I mean,
00:08:10 what the hell else are we going to talk about on this shitty fucking topic?
00:08:15 You know, I get that complaint of like why women would feel objectified and feel shitty if like
00:08:22 just like you said, the dregs of society are always wanting to fuck them. But like,
00:08:28 from my point of view, it's the same thing, except the dregs of society always want to
00:08:32 fight me. So what's really worse? Well, like people's dads. Yeah, like people's dads.
00:08:38 Uh, yeah, that's true. That's true. Can we talk about that for a second,
00:08:45 that Jess is trying to fight every dad on earth? Yeah, I'm making that a... I'm gonna make it a
00:08:51 patron reward tier for a certain amount. I will fight your dad. I will... I'll fly out. I will
00:08:58 have a real fight. It'll be on YouTube and everything. You're gonna go to them. They don't
00:09:02 even come to you. Yeah, it's gonna have to be a high reward tier because I'm gonna need a lot of
00:09:07 money to pay for these endeavors, but it'll be worth it. If I can... If I can go down in history
00:09:12 as like the YouTube guy who fights dads, that's a good legacy. This is great. Munchie goes out
00:09:19 and captures them, you know, sets them up and then you fight them, you know. He sex them up and
00:09:23 you knock them down. There you go. I think this is the first feature film in the PCP Cinematic
00:09:28 Universe is that instead of Rocky, it's called Daddy, where Jess just beats up people's dads.
00:09:34 Endless Jess versus the dads. Yeah, yeah. Okay, well...
00:09:39 Instead of the kid catcher in Chitty Chitty Bing Bing, Munchie is the dad catcher.
00:09:43 Of course. Is that a reference that's lost on this generation?
00:09:46 By the way, I do want to say about that, about what you're saying here about the being annoyed
00:09:50 by the dregs, I'd be like being objectified. I mean, I'm sure that's annoying for women to
00:09:54 be objectified by people, but even putting that aside, even if you're not objectified,
00:10:00 I'm just saying just the fact that people ever come up to you at all and, you know,
00:10:05 it tried to talk to you like people are boring and they're gay and I don't want to hear from them
00:10:11 ever. So just on that level, just on that level, like, yeah, you know, there are definitely advantages
00:10:17 to being women, but that's definitely something that would annoy me because as a man, no one in
00:10:21 my life has ever approached me with any proposition of any kind. Nobody gives a fuck about me.
00:10:26 No, as a man, I just constantly get approached with hostility and mockery all day everywhere I go.
00:10:35 Like women complain about catcalling, like, hey, you're hot and you're pretty and I want to fuck
00:10:40 you. Like, yeah, that would be annoying. But I walk outside every day and I also get people catcalling,
00:10:45 except they're saying like, hey, faggot, out of a moving car and like, fuck you buddy, screw you.
00:10:52 And it's like, that's way worse. Well, when you walk around in your your brony t-shirts, Jesse,
00:10:57 a little bit of that is to be expected. I do not know. I do not dress provocatively. I dress as
00:11:03 like I try to like hide my my my strength as much as I can. I wear like overcoats, like a
00:11:09 teenage mutant ninja turtle, like I hide my fucking shell when I go out wearing wearing a turtle mask.
00:11:17 That's why, dude. I like that Nate is suggesting that Jess was asking for it based on what he was wearing.
00:11:23 That's exactly right. Hey, how could you fucking fascist. Nate is that guy who's driving by in like
00:11:30 cars with open windows going, hey, faggot, fuck you. I got that horn that's
00:11:37 Oh my god. It annoys me so much. It happens to me every time I go out. It's like, I really do dress
00:11:42 like as normal as possible to try and avoid people looking at me. Like I wear like a baseball cap and
00:11:48 like just a regular t-shirt and jeans and guys will like yell shot. And like, I get so mad when
00:11:52 people fuck with me that like, I will fucking go out into the middle of the street as they're like
00:11:56 peeling away and like, like called Drogo like stomping around like, the fucking most fucking
00:12:02 the fucking shotgun. I'll fucking fight all you. I'm like fighting random cars that have nothing to
00:12:07 do with it. I'm jumping in. I'm jumping through other people's windows and like driving after them
00:12:12 and a whole chase breaks out. It's an adventure every time. You know, that's interesting, Jesse,
00:12:18 but I have to say I have never been in any kind of serious fight in my life, nor have I ever even
00:12:24 been close to that level. So I just wonder, do you think it might have something to do with
00:12:28 your aura or perhaps just the place you live? Perhaps that place is just more hostile than the
00:12:33 world that I grew up in and existed now. I think I'm just too, I'm just too handsome and strong.
00:12:38 People hate me for it. The world can't handle this. You know, there was a, in part six of JoJo,
00:12:45 there was a particular stand called survivor and its unique ability was really shit. Nobody liked
00:12:50 it, but its power was that it made everyone around it a little more on edge, just a little more
00:12:56 pissed off than they were normally. And what happened was like during the part where like
00:13:00 that thing was going around, like everyone in this entire jail where the thing took place,
00:13:04 they all started fighting because they were all just a little bit pissed off and then someone
00:13:07 did something and then they all had a massive fight and it's a huge riot inside the jail.
00:13:12 And I think that might be you, my friend. You might have, you might have some sort of superpower
00:13:17 here. Yeah, I might. I definitely do. I definitely get people to a certain point somehow without
00:13:25 without doing anything. Have you guys ever done any sort of drive by cat call either to a man
00:13:30 or a woman just yelling something at somebody on the street as you drive by?
00:13:36 I've never done anything like that though. I have done, you know, numerous like more like
00:13:40 approaches, you know, and shit in my, in my heyday. Well, I don't mean like hitting on somebody.
00:13:45 Like the example I wanted to give was that back when I lived in Iowa, my friend Biggs,
00:13:50 the only thing you would ever yell at people as we drove by them, they'll be walking on the
00:13:54 sidewalk and he'll just yell, get a car! And that's it. Over and over again to these lowly creatures
00:14:01 without people. We don't know if they don't have a car. They're just walking. So that's what I
00:14:07 guess he strongly disapproves this. Well, I've never, I've never cat called anybody. I don't think.
00:14:12 I feel ashamed. I should have cat called somebody by now. I should do it. I should go out and say,
00:14:17 hey baby, give me that pussy! You know, one of those. Does it work? One of those, yeah. I mean,
00:14:22 of course, why do men keep doing it? Because it gets results, right? I would assume that's the case.
00:14:27 No, what we need is a wingman. So you got to drive and you got to like be holding action giraffe
00:14:32 out the other window like, hey baby, I got AIDS! I got AIDS! But this guy doesn't over here and then
00:14:38 he comes to you. I look like a hero by comparison. I look like a real catch. That's true. That's
00:14:44 true. Or just a guy to, just to like, you know, be the guy in the dark alley where the lady turns
00:14:49 down and like, she's like, hey baby, I'm gonna get in that. I'm gonna get in that now. And she's
00:14:55 like, no, please. And then I come in and I beat up my friend and then I take her home and we do the
00:15:01 sex. That's a pretty solid plan. Wait, you want to be like an alley man? Yeah, I want to be an alley
00:15:09 man. My goal in life is to be like the mugger at the beginning of the superhero movie who gets
00:15:16 beat up by the hero first, before he has to fight the supervillain. Oh my god, you know what?
00:15:21 That reminds me of, this is sort of relevant to what we're talking about, what are the greatest
00:15:26 moments in all of anime, of all time, is from, it's called like, something something Nietzsche Joe,
00:15:33 it's not Nietzsche Joe, it's like the high school boy version, it's got like a longer name, it's like
00:15:37 boys, something Nietzsche Joe, everyday lives of high school boys. So there's a moment in that,
00:15:43 in that fucking manga, sorry, anime, where, so like, there's just like a bunch of dudes,
00:15:49 like a bunch of Japanese high school kids are just hanging out in an alley. And they're just like,
00:15:53 they're like talking about like homework or like science, like they're being like responsible,
00:15:57 mature students. And then all of a sudden, like a girl walks in, right, like a girl walks in and
00:16:03 she sees these three like, slightly rough looking dudes hanging out at this alley. And she's just
00:16:08 like, she steps down, she doesn't notice them, she sees them and she's like, oh, uh, uh, uh,
00:16:12 and they're just like, what are you doing here? And like, they're not, they're just like, hey,
00:16:15 what's going on? Like, what's up? But she's like spooked just because she didn't know what she was
00:16:20 walking into. Then all of a sudden, like another dude walks into the alley, like and sees the
00:16:26 situation, he sees like this girl spooked by three guys. And she said, and he says to it like,
00:16:31 he assesses the situation. And he's just like, I know what I have to fucking do. He steps up and
00:16:36 he's like, Hey, you three ruffians, quit hassling this lady. And all of a sudden these three guys
00:16:42 who were just like super willing, they were just going to like help her get directions or like
00:16:45 guide her out of there or whatever. They just look at each other and they know what they have to do.
00:16:49 They're like, Hey, man, fuck off. We were going to play with that bitch. She was going to be ours.
00:16:53 We were just going to have a little fun. And they all began aggressing towards the guy. And so
00:16:58 the guy is just like, Yes, this is my chance. He proceeds to beat them up as they allow him to
00:17:03 beat them all up. And they're just like, Yes, this is what we have to do. They allow themselves to
00:17:08 be beaten up. And then the lady is like, Oh my God, thank you so much for saving from those ruffians
00:17:12 as the dude like escorts throughout like, haha, I'm the fucking hero. And the guys just get up,
00:17:16 they nod each other like, Yep, we did it, man. We really, we were, we were what society needed
00:17:21 today. That's really inspirational. I want to do that. I want to set up a fucking heroes like a
00:17:26 like a like a slip and jimmy wingman scam where I can pretend to be a rape boy. And if the plan
00:17:34 goes wrong, I just accidentally end up raping the girl because the guy didn't get there in time.
00:17:40 Where were you? You gotta commit. You made me you made me a bad boy.
00:17:47 Okay, so we've talking about how great it is to commit rape. But let's talk a little bit more
00:17:53 about how great it is to be raped. Well, we need to backtrack Nate, because we were listing all
00:17:57 the negatives of being a woman and the things you would face and we lost in the catcalling world.
00:18:03 So what are the other disadvantages? Okay, well, there's a real okay, this is a real thing, right?
00:18:09 Women are right because we just talked about that. Well, not really, but like women are objectively
00:18:14 on the whole, not every single person, but they're generally weaker than men. So when you got a woman
00:18:18 walking outside alone, and like you're just doing whatever, you know, you're just walking home or
00:18:22 whatever. And I feel the same fear whenever I'm walking out alone, I'm like, Oh, God, everyone's
00:18:25 going to fucking murder me. But when you see just like any person, you know, there is a pretty good
00:18:31 chance that they are stronger than you and could overpower you. There's at least a 50% chance,
00:18:36 because you know, men or whatever. And if you know it's a man, then you know this guy could be you.
00:18:41 So like, in that situation, if you're like unprepared, you don't have anything to defend
00:18:45 yourself with, like that person could push your shit in if they wanted to. And I don't know about
00:18:51 you guys, but I don't trust anyone ever. Whenever I see a cop, I assume he wants to kill me. I assume
00:18:57 he wants me dead. So I will just do whatever the fuck he, yeah, serial killers, like just just as a
00:19:03 cop has like infinitely or you know, a more than enough advantage over me to kill me if he wants to,
00:19:08 because he has a gun, like to a woman, most men just have that advantage, because they generally
00:19:14 are just stronger. They could take you down if they felt like it. So just like, it's a little
00:19:18 bit spooky, you know, being a woman out there, just, just being out there doing whatever you
00:19:22 want. So like, I, my female friends will generally tell me like, and I've had some people, I know
00:19:28 I've had some bad stories with this shit, they'll just be out walking. And they're scared, because
00:19:33 they don't want to die. They don't want to get raped. They don't want bad shit to happen to them.
00:19:36 So just on a physical level, you know, that's a disadvantage, not to mention the fact that of
00:19:40 course women have a vagina, which is a desired thing by most men. So like, it's like a guy walking
00:19:46 around, has nothing to offer, like there's no reason to like be women have those. I've been
00:19:50 looking in the wrong places. Women. Yeah. So like, it's like women like have a diamond whenever
00:19:59 they're walking outside that every man really wants. And like, if a guy is pushed over the edge,
00:20:03 he might go for it. You know, it just, and I'm not trying to say men are demons or anything.
00:20:07 It's just like, I don't trust anyone. I have no faith that anyone will do the right thing at any
00:20:11 point. And so I totally feel why women are spooked by this shit. All right, Nate, I got the ultimate
00:20:17 solution for this problem. If we become women, here's what we should do. It's a new invention.
00:20:21 You might have heard of it. It's called the gun. You get one of these bad boys, and you're stronger
00:20:26 than anybody else because then you just shoot them. Yeah. That's true. That's true. But you keep
00:20:32 using the word spook to describe women who are about to get raped. Like a rapist comes out,
00:20:40 and they just do the standing in place scooby-doo run before they fucking flip the book top.
00:20:47 You're oversimplifying the spectrum of spook right now because there's,
00:20:51 it's really a spectrum. It's really a spectrum. Jess, I got a question for you.
00:20:56 We know you can beat up any dad on earth. And on the subject of female physicality, I want to know.
00:21:02 Who wins in a fight? Endless Jess or Ronda Rousey?
00:21:09 I'm gonna have to say Endless Jess. Oh, fucking shit. I'm surprised. What's your case there,
00:21:15 dude? She wants fucking kill you. Bullshit. Shut up. I'm just sick of that fucking,
00:21:21 that like, that any woman in any sport could beat any regular man ever. It's all bullshit.
00:21:28 You take the fucking, you take fucking the black widow from the Avengers and a regular
00:21:34 fat guy off of from like a video store and the guy from the video store will win every time.
00:21:40 I hate movies. I hate fucking this. Just people just wanking themselves off about strong women.
00:21:45 It's fake. There's no such thing. Fuck Ronda Rousey. You can take the world's most honorable
00:21:54 Bushido woman. You know, she's got her katana. It has been folded 20,000 times. So she's 20 times
00:22:00 stronger. Jesus Christ. And all I do is I say hold, I put on 250 pounds. I become a fat piece
00:22:06 of shit. I say hold my beer, bitch. And then I've won. I have defeated her. I have defeated her. Yes.
00:22:14 Okay. You know what pisses me off? Like if a guy did fight Ronda Rousey and he won,
00:22:23 he'd get no credit. They just like dismiss it as beating a woman. But if he lost, that's true.
00:22:28 He'd be even doubly mocked for it like, oh, you lost to a woman. So which is it? Is she on an
00:22:33 equal playing field or not? Well, she has a disadvantage, you know, there's a disadvantage.
00:22:38 Nate, have you listened to biggest problem in the universe? I know Jesse was only seven episodes of
00:22:44 me to finish it. Was there one of the episodes or was this a different podcast where they talked
00:22:48 about like a trans woman. So like a guy who becomes a woman was in mixed martial arts and he
00:22:53 like won a tournament and how that was bullshit. So that's, is that kind of the same thing?
00:22:58 Yes, it's related. It's like the practical way to achieve this. Okay, so the practical way to beat
00:23:03 up women and still get credit for it. Hey, wait a minute. Go to think of it. Why am I fighting
00:23:08 Ronda Rousey? The deal was that I would fight Ronda Rousey's decrepit father. That was my thing
00:23:14 from the beginning. Well, yeah, I mean, Frank, you probably have a bigger trouble with her body.
00:23:21 Jess versus Frank Rousey.
00:23:25 Well, okay, so on that topic, because I always thought that was interesting. So, okay, so like
00:23:30 there's, what is in fact the difference between men and women physically, right? So there's,
00:23:36 there's a bunch of stuff. There's like hormones, the presence of testosterone. More like the
00:23:41 building muscle. Oh, you nailed it, dude. You nailed it. There's like bone density differences.
00:23:48 Obviously, there's like, there's anatomical differences, right? That's real shit. That's
00:23:52 real shit. So, so right now we know that we're not looking at the same thing. So if a man wants
00:23:58 to compete with women and say that it's totally even, like he's got no advantages,
00:24:03 like what we would say now, what they do now is like they have them going like hormone therapy,
00:24:07 right? To even the playing field. So they, they haven't taken estrogen and shit and, and
00:24:12 don't take testosterone. Are you talking about the transgender AMA fighter or MMA fighter?
00:24:17 Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I don't think it goes on hormones to even the playing
00:24:20 field. It's because he wants to get a woman's body. It doesn't have to do with his job.
00:24:25 Well, but if we were trying to make it fair, you would have to do something to address the real
00:24:30 differences just from there. If we wanted to make it fair, we'd say you don't get to do this because
00:24:34 you were born a man. Okay, but there might be a way. Go fight in the men's league.
00:24:41 Yeah. I mean, it's okay. So with this point, we got a couple of categories now. So you've got
00:24:46 men who are just men. You got women who are just women. But then there's, I mean, there's some
00:24:51 clear gray area here. If you're going to be transitioning or whatever, there's, there's
00:24:55 got to be a way to account for that difference. Well, what it is, there should be a tranny
00:24:58 league. Well, like it's, it's, it works like Pokemon. There's three stages. Like you go from
00:25:05 like a man into a trans woman. And then with the help of a thunderstorm, you become just a woman.
00:25:11 Yeah, it makes sense. Why a thunderstorm?
00:25:14 Um, I don't know what a moonstone make more sense. I think so.
00:25:20 A moonstone. Well, if you're trying to become a man, uh, yeah, you need a thunderstorm to become
00:25:26 a man so you can become Chad Thundercock. Right. Yeah. That's the one. That's the one.
00:25:32 Have you guys been seeing these memes incidentally recently that have been poking them and popping
00:25:36 up of like, uh, how like the virgin stands versus how the Chad stands or how they sit?
00:25:42 Yes, it turns out I'm a virgin. I don't know, whatever. I fucking love them. Chad is my hero.
00:25:49 Uh, but anyway. Oh, we'll get into that later when we talk about if we were women.
00:25:54 Oh yeah. That's exciting. That's exciting. Um, I don't know. Uh, that's, that's been addressed,
00:26:00 I guess. Oh, it's, it's crazy, man. I don't know. Uh, like we could talk about like, so,
00:26:05 so if you're actually transitioning from a man to woman IRL, uh, it's, it's complex. You know,
00:26:11 you would have to really restructure your whole fucking anatomy and like your bone structure
00:26:15 and you have to install a vagina, which I think they do now at least to some degree. Yeah, they do.
00:26:19 Um, but, but, but, uh, Caitlyn Jenner still is a penis. Just, um, just throwing that out there.
00:26:28 What do you think about that, monkey? What does that put her on the? I think that's,
00:26:30 that's none of your business, what Caitlyn Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlyn Jenner? Yeah.
00:26:38 I just want to say though, what is my business is what pronoun I'm forced to use for someone,
00:26:44 that if they're going to tell me I have to refer to someone some way, then it becomes my business
00:26:49 what, what they are forcing me to do. And, um, I'm just, is it insensitive to say like,
00:26:56 you know, if you're going to make me say he or she or whatever, like, let's see some documentation.
00:27:00 Let's see some proof that, uh, you know, I just don't like being forced to do something on the
00:27:06 other person's word, because I don't, as I've said, I'm consistent on this. I don't trust anyone.
00:27:11 Uh, if you just look like a woman, if I saw Caitlyn Jenner on the street,
00:27:14 would absolutely call her female because she looks that way. No problem with that at all.
00:27:17 But if somebody who looks male comes up to me and just says, hey, call me she, call me whatever,
00:27:23 then I don't think it's crazy to say like, okay, uh, but why though? Like what's,
00:27:30 what's, what's the situation here, dude? What am I, what am I looking at here? What are we
00:27:32 dealing with? Here's an example of this that happened to me recently. Uh, as we've discussed
00:27:38 in the previous couple episodes of this show, there is a recent, uh, the, the Tranny Phantom
00:27:43 massacre that the guy, Randy Stair, who shot up the thing, he wanted to join Embers Ghost Squad,
00:27:50 but Randy is, or was transgender. So my friend, Bedhead Bernie, love him to death, but I think he,
00:27:56 he made a tactical error on this. He wrote up a script about the, the, the whole thing
00:28:02 and I had to narrate it. And when we referred, or when he referred to Randy in the script,
00:28:07 he would use they, them pronouns, which is very confusing because we're talking about one person.
00:28:13 So the comments were just, it was a firestorm of who the fuck is they, uh, and like, why are you
00:28:20 respecting the preferred pronouns of a, of a mass shooter? Like, why would you do that?
00:28:25 That's a tough one. That's a tough one. I think a lot of, okay, now finish your point.
00:28:28 Well, yeah. So like Bernie's, Bernie said he wanted to do it professionally because he's making all
00:28:32 these videos for his portfolio so we can get into college and all this shit. But like in that case,
00:28:38 fuck Randy Stair. Fuck their preferred pronouns. I don't care what you think you are. You think
00:28:42 you're a fucking ghost. I don't give a shit. Randy's a guy.
00:28:46 That's like an ethical quandary, like, um, yeah, like, uh, how like it's our generations
00:28:50 crucible to decide like what bathrooms, uh, trans people should use. It's like our generations
00:28:56 crucible to decide should you respect the pronouns of a killer. You know what that reminds me of?
00:29:01 Should you like not punch Nazis is another question on the table for our generation.
00:29:07 That's a big thing happening right now. Okay. But, but that aside, you know, okay,
00:29:10 just I think like any trans activist or whatever, any person in the know would probably argue that
00:29:15 like, okay, yes, this guy is a bad person. You know, he could kill people. It's objectively wrong.
00:29:22 But like, I think what they would say is like, we should segregate, uh, to use the inappropriate
00:29:29 word separate, but equal. We should. Okay. We should separate like a person's like gender
00:29:34 identity from any crimes they commit. And we shouldn't lump in like their, their murderous
00:29:39 tendency, mental illness shit with their gender fluidity or confusion. Uh, that's probably the
00:29:45 case they would make. What do you, what do you think about that? I think I'm still thinking
00:29:50 about Ronda Rousey and how much. When she fucking, when she comes on like a talk show
00:29:56 and like, like Conan O'Brien or, or whatever, or like Jimmy Kimmel, whatever, like,
00:30:01 loser talk show host will like pretend to be like afraid of her. Like, oh, Ronda Rousey is
00:30:06 going to beat me up. Come on, Conan, you're like six foot five. What are you doing? What are you,
00:30:11 all right? I was, I was joking before, but Ronda Rousey would definitely beat your ass and would
00:30:16 definitely beat most men's ass. Like I was just kidding before. She would easily. I don't believe
00:30:20 you. I don't care what anyone says. She's a trained killer. She's a trained killer, dude. She will
00:30:25 fucking kill you. I'm a self-trained killer. I've been shadowboxing for 20 years like fucking
00:30:31 old boy. What the hell is shadowboxing? I've been killing on the streets of fucking,
00:30:37 probably. Like Jess, I get that you're strong, but she has, she knows how to fight.
00:30:41 If it works for old boy, it works for me. That's how I approach every situation in life.
00:30:46 You don't get a hammer in this fight. Hey, you know, on this issue of gender identity,
00:30:50 I did want to say though that. Look, if I can't beat Ronda Rousey, then at least Conan O'Brien
00:30:57 could definitely beat her. Conan O'Brien's like 10 feet tall. He's got that Irish boxing stance
00:31:06 from the 1920s. Yeah, he does. You can't step to that in an MMA ring. They outlawed that from
00:31:11 MMA because it was too powerful. Look, he is an untrained twink fuck boy. He would get his shit
00:31:18 pushed in. Nobody on earth is stronger than Conan O'Brien. We're working on Invader Zim logic
00:31:28 right now. Like the tallest man is the most powerful. It has dominion over all he can lay his
00:31:33 eyes on. So Jeff would beat all of her asses then? Is that why we kicked him out of PCB because he
00:31:40 can kill all of us? He was too much of a threat. He was too strong. Can we get serious and talk
00:31:50 about how we would fuck all the guys in high school if we were girls? Yes, but in one second,
00:31:54 I just want to say about this. I really want to talk about that. We will get, we will certainly
00:31:58 get there. I've been joking about this a lot, but I do actually feel like, okay, so gender is
00:32:03 actually pretty crazy and there's legitimately people out there who feel weird about it. I
00:32:08 definitely think that it's kind of a meme that people who wouldn't necessarily be into it are
00:32:13 just kind of, are just like, yeah, that sounds fun. Let's get into it. I mean, I have no idea how
00:32:17 rampant that is, but I'm sure that's there to some degree, just like any trend or craze would be.
00:32:23 But on the, just to address this, I feel like it's a little bit of a, it's problematic. It's a
00:32:31 little bit problematic that in English, I know we don't have any real good way of addressing people
00:32:38 that don't adhere to the binary of male or female. So I'm just saying like, I feel for people, you
00:32:44 know, the fact that we have men and female bathrooms that, you know, that kind of sucks for
00:32:48 people who are floating around somewhere in the middle. So I have legitimate sympathy for them,
00:32:53 but here's where, here's my red pill and comes in. On a practical level, these people are the
00:32:59 vast minority. How much effort are we really going to put in to worrying about their specific
00:33:05 interest? And I know in a perfect world, we would just bam, put like an extra bathroom for everybody,
00:33:09 for everyone fucking gender identity there is, have an extra bathroom just for them so that
00:33:13 everybody feels safe and at home. But practically, can we really be doing this guys? Can we really be
00:33:19 fucking around with this? I think the solution is that we don't need more bathrooms. We need one
00:33:24 bathroom for everyone. It's fucking hard that we have two bathrooms in the first place.
00:33:30 You know, you're absolutely 100% right on that. I mean, think about it. When you were three years
00:33:33 old, your mom would take you into the women's bathroom because you're too fucking young to
00:33:37 go by yourself. When I was a young boy, my mother took me into the women's bathroom to take a
00:33:43 Mando shit. Yeah, right. I mean, I didn't get traumatized walking into the women's bathroom
00:33:50 when I was three. So, I mean, realistically, what's the worst I can have? Like everyone in the
00:33:54 world, you live in a house with women and you usually have one bathroom and nobody gets raped
00:34:00 usually. Why the fuck didn't I think that before? The problem, the problem isn't that we don't have
00:34:05 enough individual bathrooms to segregate everyone into. The problem is that we segregate them at
00:34:10 all right now. That's the problem. You know, we should have co-ed everything. It worked in
00:34:16 Starship Troopers. You know, that's my other thing. Got my first little baby boner to Starship
00:34:21 Troopers so we know it's good. That's my other philosophy in life. If it doesn't work like it
00:34:24 did an old boy, then it must work like it did in Starship Troopers. Well, thank God we just
00:34:31 solved this massive issue for everyone. Yeah. Honestly, if I'm going to rape somebody, it's
00:34:34 not when they're taking a shit. It's probably when they're not taking a shit. You know, I like the
00:34:39 rape after the shit because like the passageway that I like to use has already been stretched a
00:34:43 good way. So, you know, that works for me. That works for me. Wait, if I'm going to rape somebody...
00:34:47 With diarrhea every time they go to the bathroom, they're stretching them all?
00:34:51 That's lube, dude. And that's lubing it up just the way I like it.
00:34:54 If I'm going to rape somebody, it's going to be jumping out in a monster mask in that Scooby-Doo
00:34:59 hallway with all the doors so that even if they try to fucking run away, they'll just come through
00:35:03 the other door and I'll catch them. It's perfect. I've been studying those Scooby-Doo running in
00:35:08 and out of doors chase sequences my whole life. I have cracked the code. I become the master of
00:35:12 them, of these portals to different dimensions and now I can catch anyone during them.
00:35:18 All right, monkey. Let's get into it. How much you want to fuck our male
00:35:22 high school classmates? So, here's my problem with Digi Bro's approach. He wants to become a
00:35:29 60 year old girl and then fuck himself. You know, I might not be as traditional as most,
00:35:36 but even I'm thinking like, okay, Digi, you can do better than that. If I'm going to become a girl,
00:35:41 I want to be fucking Yamada from Yamada's first time. I want to be a hot, buxom,
00:35:46 blonde, 15 year old high school girl and I'm going to fuck every single boy in school. I'm
00:35:52 going to get the reputation of the cock-sucking queen, my friends. I'm going to go to fucking
00:35:57 college parties when I'm 15 or 16. I'm going to fuck seniors in college. Fuck it. I'm going to
00:36:02 fuck every chat. I want to know because us as guys, we only get to feel sex from our point of view.
00:36:08 Oh yeah, I'm plunging my dick into your puss, whatever. But it looks like she's enjoying that a
00:36:12 lot more than I am. You know, I've always thought the same thing. Yeah, I think it's better for them.
00:36:17 Of course it is. I think it definitely is if the guy is like at all paying attention to what the
00:36:22 girl wants. Yeah, yeah. I need to know what sex feels like as a girl and I need to abuse it by
00:36:27 being one. At the very least, it's definitely a different experience and I would absolutely love
00:36:33 to experience it at some point. Yeah, I don't think about it. If you woke up, I mean, regardless
00:36:38 of what gender you are now, if you woke up tomorrow morning just as the opposite gender, you could be
00:36:44 like the only person in history who gets the true experience of both. You cannot squander that
00:36:50 opportunity. That this is for all of humanity to know this information. This is your responsibility
00:36:55 to go out and fuck. That was like a problem with your name. He wakes up and grabs his tits
00:37:01 instead of rubbing that little clit bean all fucking day, baby. Yeah, it's true. It's true. I
00:37:07 would definitely do that if I woke up in somebody else's body. Absolutely. Are we talking about
00:37:13 gender switching or body switching? Because if you wake up in a different girl's body and you start,
00:37:18 you know, fiddle in your diddle, is that rape? You know, I was just going to bring it down to be
00:37:22 like, okay, guys, we got to talk about the whole respecting someone else's body. Okay, but first
00:37:26 of all, if you wake up and just it's your body only female, then go hog wild, dude, do whatever
00:37:31 you want to do. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. But if you are in someone else's body and you know this,
00:37:37 that raises some concerns. And I guess I would have to say, don't do it, man. I would have to say
00:37:44 don't do it. I don't think I could resist. If there's no way they're going to find out, you better
00:37:50 believe I'm doing it because it's a victimless crime. That's true. Well, I mean, that's entirely
00:37:54 true. And I don't hate, victimless crimes are as you said, victimless. So it's not really a problem,
00:38:00 right? But like the objective, if you're going for what's objectively the most moral situation,
00:38:05 I would have to say like, really beyond like masturbation, like doing as little with that
00:38:11 body as possible is like the objectively most moral thing you can do, because it's not yours
00:38:17 to use really. It's not like, I mean, like, what are you going to do? Lay there and poop your pants?
00:38:22 If you're in someone's body, you're going to have to see their pussy eventually. You're going
00:38:26 to have to take care of it. You know what? If you wake up in a woman's body, some other woman,
00:38:33 you wake up in her body, you have a responsibility to play with your pussy first thing because
00:38:36 you've got to figure out like where the tampon goes. You got to figure out like how to wipe it
00:38:41 when you pee. You got to know these things, okay? You can't just get to the bathroom and not know
00:38:45 and spray and spray fluids everywhere. I don't know. Maybe I assume they dab or at least or something.
00:38:53 Yeah, girls only have one hole. They have the cloaca. I'm just like a spider.
00:39:04 Yeah, or like a chicken, right? They just have the one hole that spews out everything they
00:39:08 don't need anymore, right? That's how I understand it.
00:39:14 How do the things we can learn when we become women?
00:39:17 Yeah, because you know what? That really is, on the other hand, on a practical level, that really
00:39:22 is something no one in history, like every guy in the world, every woman in the world,
00:39:27 has to like take every guy's word for it. Like what sex for him is like, what the orgasm is like,
00:39:33 like no one ever has crossed the boundary to experience the other side for historical
00:39:38 documentation. It would behoove you to get in there and do that shit just so you can really
00:39:43 say like, okay, they're different in these ways. This is better in that way. It would be better
00:39:47 for everyone. It would be a public service. I like that Nate's taking a very scientific discovery
00:39:54 approach and I just want to fucking flick my bean. I always got to come back to what's objectively
00:40:00 right or true, because that's the way I like to operate. Well, you know, if Nate's taking the
00:40:05 scientific approach and and Mumki's taking the base animal physiology approach, then I'm going
00:40:14 I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to take the emotional approach, the spiritual approach,
00:40:18 because you know, we mentioned the movie Your Name recently, a couple minutes ago,
00:40:25 which you know, I did a review of that movie in my hit series, The Plebe and the Weeb, which
00:40:30 comes out every week. Everyone loves it. It's every week. Hold on. The most consistent show on the
00:40:36 internet, they call it. Not my words, it's everyone else's words. Consistent in quality, maybe not
00:40:41 upload schedule. Yeah, every single week, you know, every twice a week, Monday and Wednesday,
00:40:47 every week, random shine. You know, the movie Your Name is like, it's like my dream scenario,
00:40:54 because like, the guy wakes up in the girl's body, the girl wakes up in the guy's body,
00:40:58 they wake up in each other's bodies, and because of it, they become lifelong friends,
00:41:02 they become, they form a genuine bond, they learn about each other, and it's just an unbreakable
00:41:09 union of love and friendship and camaraderie, and that's beautiful. They can't even remember their
00:41:14 names. Well, they're out of the other shit though, whatever. Yeah, I think they figured out at the
00:41:19 end, I don't really remember. Well, they just like find each other, we don't know if they become
00:41:24 friends, all we know is he stopped her village from getting killed by a meteor. You can see
00:41:28 everything you need to know from the look they share at the end. When you've been in another
00:41:31 person's body, you've been taking those poops, you've been taking those peas, that's a bunch for
00:41:37 life, nothing can break that. I get in my body back and like, dude, you wore this asshole out
00:41:44 with all that pooping, come on, save some for me, my dude, save some for me. You know what,
00:41:51 I like that approach, Jesse, what we really got here, we've got, we've really got a triforce
00:41:55 of approaches here, we've got me, the triforce of wisdom, monkey, the triforce of courage,
00:42:00 and Jesse with the triforce of power for sure, just feeling that shit out.
00:42:08 Nate and Jess, if we can switch topics real quick, I want to hear your day in the life from
00:42:14 wake up to go to bed if you are a girl and you're like a teenager. How many cocks do you suck in
00:42:22 that day? Do we know that it's only for one day? No, no, you're a girl now, so what's the
00:42:29 day? Oh, I'm just a girl. A typical day in the life. But we should, no, we should also do,
00:42:32 like, you're only a girl for one day, what do you do with it? That'd be probably better. Because
00:42:35 like, if I was a girl for one day, then you'd know I'm slutting it up as much as possible.
00:42:39 Oh, hell yeah. Of course, without a doubt, without a doubt. Well, you know, I really have to wonder,
00:42:44 I have to ask, because this is a variable that to me matters quite a bit in this situation.
00:42:50 Am I waking up like in a random girl's body, or am I waking up in the body of a girl that I
00:42:55 personally know? No, it's gonna be like a girl version of you. Oh, it's just a girl now?
00:43:06 Well, first thing I do is I'm figuring out, you know, how the clam works, you know, I'm getting
00:43:10 down there with a fucking, with a microscope and a fucking magnifying glass. I'm going, you know,
00:43:18 how do I work this thing? How do I make a profit off of this thing? And then I go out into the
00:43:24 world. And then I, and then I assume I just go out into the front lawn and go, hey, world, I've
00:43:29 got a vagina. And then I just get money and fame and attention and love just showered
00:43:35 upon me for the rest of the day. Your YouTube channel will have like an extra 100,000 subs.
00:43:40 Oh my God, that's the first thing I do. I make a fucking vlog with my Ted Sound. Holy shit.
00:43:44 Dude, you know what you do? How do you set for life? You know what you do? You make a men's
00:43:47 rights channel as a woman. That's what you do. That's how you fucking win the game.
00:43:51 That is going to be $3,000 in the first day. She won ahead, baby. Just spend the entire day
00:44:00 making nothing but like low top, low cut top vlogs and then set them out on your YouTube
00:44:06 channel like every couple of days for the rest of time. And then you can profit off that one
00:44:10 gender swap day for the rest of your life. Yeah, that's smart. That's thinking. That's thinking.
00:44:15 And also you can finger your pussy between videos. Yeah. And you butthole too. I mean,
00:44:21 you can do that as a guy, but I mean, that's totally gay. No, but that's gay, dude. Totally gay.
00:44:27 All right, so we can all agree it's not gay to get fucked if you're a girl, but what about kissing?
00:44:32 Would you kiss a guy if you're a girl? I would absolutely not know it. I mean, okay, well the
00:44:37 thing about like, okay, so the thing about like, sex in general is a lot, a lot of the gratification
00:44:44 comes from pleasing the other person, right? So like, if you're kissing the other person or if
00:44:48 you're like, let's give a guy a bloge, you know, you give him some bloge, like what, what is enjoyable
00:44:53 about that experience that a lot of women, you know, like a lot of women legitimately do enjoy
00:44:57 doing that, it's that they're making the other person feel good. So like for, for, for us in this
00:45:01 situation, that's us, like a guy who's now become a girl, like what we're getting into right now
00:45:06 is pleasing a guy, which is gay. That's gay. Okay, well, super gay. I just want to get my
00:45:14 I don't care if he feels good. Okay, well, in that case, yeah, I mean, in that case, it's,
00:45:19 it's, it's whatever. In terms of kissing, though, you know, you probably got to,
00:45:22 that's the thing that you do to ease into it, you know, because like, you can't, you really,
00:45:26 you really cannot just come up to a guy and say, I want to fuck, because every guy will assume that
00:45:31 you have an ulterior motive, but that you got something going on with you, like you're a weirdo,
00:45:34 you got STDs, something's fucked up with you, you got to, you got to pretend like you like are
00:45:39 into it for some bigger reason, which is true. Hey, I'm actually a guy, I'm in a woman's body
00:45:44 this is for science, we have to do this right now, and he'll be like, my God, if it's for science,
00:45:47 he'll be into it, he'll be into it. This will be who the human race, we have to do this.
00:45:50 That's a better case than just saying I just want to fuck, because I, I don't know, I don't know.
00:45:56 Guys listening at home, if you ever wake up as a woman and you want to fuck, go to Nate and just
00:46:00 say it's for science and you'll be down. Yeah, say it's for Starfleet. I would definitely do that.
00:46:04 I would without a doubt do it. If I knew that shit was true, of course, of course. Here's my
00:46:08 problem with kissing a guy. If you close your eyes, you could probably pretend it's a girl,
00:46:12 but if they got any facial hair, I don't want that itchy shit rubbing up against me while
00:46:16 we're kissing, no way. You know, ooh, that's a tough one. There's no way, I couldn't be horny,
00:46:22 my pussy would be as dry as the Sahara Desert. Okay, well, we gotta address this fact. We gotta
00:46:27 address this fact, like have we become attracted to men through the gender swap? Yeah, are we now?
00:46:32 No, I'm still me, I have my brain, I just have a girl's body. Okay, okay, all right. Yeah, I was
00:46:37 gonna ask, like, how much of my brain has become girl? Like, no, I thought about this a lot.
00:46:44 Would boys still be gross to me? I assume they would. Well, okay, you know what, this is gonna
00:46:49 make me sound 100% gay, but I have, I've always had a sincere appreciation for the male form.
00:46:57 And I do think that if I was all of a sudden a girl, I could probably get myself into the head
00:47:02 space where if I find just like some really attractive guy, I would just enjoy being around
00:47:06 him. Oh god, I'm fucking gay. I'm literally gay. I'm literally gay now.
00:47:12 I mean, don't you guys have a list of male celebrities who you would fuck right now as a guy?
00:47:17 I do. If Jake Gyllenhaal came knocking on my door, I'd be gay with him for a night, fuck it.
00:47:23 Yes, my list is Paul F. Tompkins and nobody else.
00:47:28 You love those mustaches.
00:47:31 Mine's mostly anime characters. I'd fuck Rance, I'd definitely fuck Rance. He wouldn't want to
00:47:35 fuck me, but I'd fuck him if you wanted to. You know, I think if I were a girl, if I were in it,
00:47:41 like I had a girl by it for a day, what I would do, you know, I would wait until like five minutes
00:47:48 to midnight and then I would challenge Rhonda Rousey to a fight. And like she'd be beating me up
00:47:57 because I'm a girl, like she'd think she had it in the bag, but then midnight strikes, I turned
00:48:02 back into a strong boy and I'm like, no, I've got you where I want you. To coob. Bam, bam, bam, bam.
00:48:08 And then I'm punching her. I'm throwing her like over the cage wall. I'm so strong now. My man strength
00:48:14 is out of control. And I just get the trophies. I get the trophies and the gold, the belts. I get
00:48:20 all the MMA awards ever. Joe Rogan comes out and personally congratulates me. He puts his arm around
00:48:25 me like, how'd you do it? And then in the second round, you turn into a guy and you're really beat
00:48:29 up that bag, Rhonda Rousey. And I'm like, that's right. That's right, Rogan. I did it. Praise me.
00:48:35 Bow. You've got to get a millennium puzzle and pretend that you're Yugi transforming
00:48:39 Yugi halfway through. Oh, that's good. Oh, man, that's good. That's good. I've always had a fear,
00:48:46 though, about this, that what if you're, you know, you just get lost track. You're just orgasming
00:48:51 over and over. You're getting fucked by, you know, every Tom Dick and Harry up the block. My biggest
00:48:55 fear. Well, it's, it's that you're, you transform back at midnight, right? But what if some dude is,
00:49:00 you know, balls deep at that moment and you transform and now you got, now you got a dick
00:49:06 permanently fused up inside your body, which is definitely gay. You'd be like attached at the
00:49:11 dick like Siamese bros. Exactly. Yeah. Isn't that the plot of the movie stuck on you?
00:49:17 I hope so. Is that true? How true is that? Go watch that movie. Yeah, with Matt Damon and Drillbit
00:49:28 Taylor. Was that Matt Damon in that movie? I don't know. The special guest appearance,
00:49:35 special guest appearance by Ron's arousy as the bitch who gets beat the fuck up by the two,
00:49:40 by the two conjoined at the dick man. She thought she was fighting a woman, but midnight struck and
00:49:46 the woman turned into two conjoined at the dick men, one played by Matt Damon and the other played
00:49:51 by the character Drillbit Taylor, not Owen Wilson. Oh shit, it was Matt Damon. What the fuck? Wow.
00:50:00 I don't remember that being Matt Damon. That's crazy. You have to rewatch that shit. It actually
00:50:04 has positive score on Rotten Tomatoes. What the hell? Does it really? Yeah, 61%. The other guy was
00:50:10 Greg Kenyer. I don't know who that is. I wonder what Bubble Boy has in Rotten Tomatoes. I'm going
00:50:16 to look that up. Yeah, let us know. Who could forget Bubble Boy? Fun fact, Bubble Boy is Zach
00:50:23 Galifianakis' first movie. He plays the bus ticket guy. That's fascinating. You know what I always
00:50:30 loved in the movie Juno? What's his name? Michael Sarah? Not Michael Sarah. Neither of them. It's
00:50:38 a bit character from the very beginning. You know the guy who played the nerd? Fuck, I can't
00:50:42 remember his name from the office. The American office. You know what I'm talking about? Ryan?
00:50:49 Not Ryan. Who's the fucking weirdo creep? Dwight, of course. Dwight. The actor who plays Dwight
00:50:53 is in the very beginning of that and as Juno is getting her pregnancy results, she's just
00:50:59 standing at the counter. I guess she just pissed on in the bathroom and is looking at it and he
00:51:02 just says, your ego is prego. Okay. It was the grayest line of all time. That's pretty funny.
00:51:10 Pretty good, dude. Pretty good. Oh my god. Would you get pregnant as the girl? That's the fear
00:51:16 because I want to slud it up for that day but then like am I pregnant as a man the next day?
00:51:21 Are my eggs finalized? Oh my god. What happens? I always have that fear of spiders crawling in my
00:51:28 ear at night and then laying eggs and like feeling my brain with eggs and I am the spider boy under
00:51:32 their control forever. Same situation, you know? Wait a minute. Terrified. Terrifying. I think what
00:51:39 would happen is if you got impregnated as a woman and then turned back into a boy, I mean you would
00:51:44 now have the fertilized egg inside you but it would be like in your dick or ball sack region.
00:51:50 Which means that you would be shooting out the fertilized egg. You could theoretically
00:51:55 fuck a hole in the ground and grow children from soil.
00:52:00 I was hoping for a more, what's that Arnold Schwarzenegger movie where he gets pregnant?
00:52:05 Daddy Daycare? No, that's not the one.
00:52:10 Junior. I think it's called Junior. I believe it's called Terminator 2.
00:52:18 In case you were wondering, Bubble Boy has a score of 30% on Rotten Tomatoes.
00:52:23 Sorry Jake Gyllenhaal.
00:52:27 Now 30% doesn't mean that it's only 30% good. 30% means that 30% of people gave it like 10 out of
00:52:35 10, 100%. Oh really? He ends the movie by falling down Niagara Falls in a bubble. How can you not like
00:52:43 it? I'm definitely all 30% of those. When I was a kid, I had three VHSs that mean
00:52:52 my brother watched over and over again. We had Bubble Boy, we had Max Keebles, Big Move,
00:52:57 and we had Rat Race. Two of the three we should not have been watching. Rat Race is a masterpiece.
00:53:03 Hell yeah. We could do a whole episode on Rat Race. Any movie that ends with an actual smash
00:53:08 mouth concert is a certified fucking masterpiece. Fuck yeah. Get fucked John Cleese. There you go.
00:53:18 Is it said that my only exposure for the majority of my life to John Cleese was fucking Rat Race
00:53:23 and not like Monty Python or anything? Is that true? Oh no, that's sad. I didn't know he was in
00:53:26 anything else. I thought he was just the guy from Rat Race. That is sad. Fucking good Monty
00:53:34 Python. Good, good movie. Good Holy Grail. Upvoted. Top, top, top pick on Reddit. Shut the fuck up.
00:53:42 I don't know what I'm doing. Okay, here we go. I feel like we've exhausted this. Are we done?
00:53:46 We got any closing points to make about this whole gender swapping thing.
00:53:50 So I guess if you wake up as a girl and you want to fuck, go fuck Nate and also carry a gun and
00:53:56 don't try to fight Ronda Rousey, I think that's what we learned today. Which you can do immediately
00:54:01 when you change back. Anyone can beat Ronda Rousey. Any woman who wakes up tomorrow as a man,
00:54:07 the first thing you'd better do for science is go fight Ronda Rousey.
00:54:15 Shit, you know, I felt like we didn't really talk enough. Maybe we should right now,
00:54:18 just about the whole thing about being a woman turning into a guy and what you can expect.
00:54:22 What can your average woman expect when she wakes up as a guy the next day? You know,
00:54:26 because we're gender inclusive here. I think get ready for all the attention,
00:54:33 all that people giving a shit about you, gone. It's gone. Don't expect any person to ever do
00:54:39 anything for you ever again. Nobody gives a fuck about that. Do not try online dating. You're not
00:54:42 going to get any results at all. That's correct. That's correct. Zero messages. In fact, don't
00:54:47 leave the house because the world is a nightmare now. Yeah, every woman becomes a man for one day
00:54:56 and like halfway through it, she's already like on all the MRA boards and all the like men going
00:55:01 their own way boards. She's done. She can't take it anymore. She hasn't at the years of training
00:55:07 that we have to get to this point alive. Be excited women. When you go to work as a man,
00:55:11 you'll get an automatic 30% raise. I was going to say that. God damn it. Yep. Yeah. 23 cents on the
00:55:18 dollar. Bam in your pocket. Day one. They're like, Oh my God, we've made a huge mistake. We didn't
00:55:22 realize you were a man all along. Didn't realize you had a dick. Here's the extra cash. That's how
00:55:26 it works. It's just that easy. That's why I really feel for the transitioning community from male
00:55:33 to female. It's tough enough. It's tough enough. Just going through the process of all that,
00:55:41 but then when they just walk into work one day and they're like, my pay, oh no, 277 cents on the
00:55:46 dollar. It sucks. Sorry, dude, that's corporate policy. What can we do? That's just how it works.
00:55:50 That's just how it works. Obama wanted it. Here's some benefits. Going P, it's going to be kind of
00:55:55 fun now. You don't have to get your butt on that dirty toilet seat. Sometimes in a restaurant
00:56:01 or a bar, they'll put a little fly sticker in the urinal, so you can try to aim at that. That's
00:56:05 kind of fun. What else we got? Sometimes you get to go pee. It's easier now. Yeah. You get to go
00:56:13 pee in a trough sometimes with all your buddies. Put your arms around each other and sing songs
00:56:18 while you do it and sway back and forth. That's fun. I don't know if that's a positive. You get
00:56:23 to hold each other's dicks. That's what we do at the old trough.
00:56:29 If you jerk off in the shower, you can see how far you can shoot your common market with a sharpie
00:56:34 and see if you can beat your last record. The projectile come thing, yeah. That's a big one.
00:56:39 That's a big one. What else we got? What other benefits are there to being a man in American
00:56:45 society today other than having a dick? This is a big one. This is a big one. You can be fat
00:56:49 and Nate won't hate you intensely immediately. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's
00:56:54 pretty good. Yeah, no joke though. Fat women, they have way worse than fat men and that is
00:57:02 kind of shitty. Yeah, for sure. On the one hand, that's kind of true, but women, okay, what does
00:57:08 it matter if you're an unattractive woman? Well, okay, I mean it does to some degree because it's
00:57:13 all about whatever, being attractive or whatever. You want to fuck somebody, right? You want to
00:57:19 catch yourself a high quality man, but there are tons of men who will still fuck you even if you're
00:57:23 fat, but if you're a fat guy, I would say that it's harder. Well, I would say that it's harder.
00:57:27 There's tons of fat guys who have who have hot female wives. There's Peter Griffin,
00:57:32 there's Homer Simpson, you know, there's a King of Queens. Yeah, don't forget King of Queens.
00:57:41 The greatest man who ever lived. Kevin James, I don't know what it is in the show. You know what
00:57:46 it really is, it's that women are, because men are visual creatures, like our appreciation of
00:57:50 women has more to do with their physicality than a woman's attraction to a man, which is more
00:57:54 about personality and confidence and shit. Yeah, you're all shallow. Yeah, you know, I guess in
00:57:58 that way, yeah, you can be, if you're a woman, you can be fat now and it won't be as big a deal.
00:58:03 That's true, that's true. What the fuck else you got? Oh, you will be expected, here's a
00:58:08 negative, you will be expected to carry shit for people who are smaller than you or all women,
00:58:14 you'll be expected to carry their shit now or hold doors. I mean, that's less prevalent these
00:58:19 days. Oh my god, you will now have to deal with the nightmare of feminism in general, hating you,
00:58:27 hating you in every way, so that sucks. You can be elected president no matter what you say
00:58:32 over a woman. You can grab pussy freely now, you know, it's the door, carte blanche for grabbing
00:58:39 pussy as we've learned. I think that's about it. I can't think of any other benefits of being a man.
00:58:45 Yeah, me neither, dude. Oh, oh, oh, you can have sex without personally getting pregnant,
00:58:50 so that's that's a nice one. You don't have to worry about that at all anymore. You might still
00:58:53 get STDs, but you will not be the one who gets knocked up for months or have to deal with the
00:58:58 whole work. You will be the one who knocks. Yes. And yeah, I think that's it. I think that's it.
00:59:08 Oh, wait, I forgot the most important one. You can now become a Catholic priest. That's
00:59:12 checkbox. Oh, you can now be in God's in God's corner. That's a good shot's fired.
00:59:18 Nate versus the Catholic Church. Look out. Not a fan. Not a fan. Oh, wait. Oh, you can now move
00:59:24 to Saudi Arabia and drive. You can now drive in Saudi Arabia. I forgot about that. You can now
00:59:29 move to Saudi Arabia and not wear a fucking scarf on your head. Well, I mean, that's a
00:59:36 I mean, we're we're down with the hijab now. That's a feminist icon thing now. So it is.
00:59:42 Yeah. Why? Why the fuck? It's very confusing. I don't know. All right. I think that's it.
00:59:48 YouTube is lucky that they banned me from uploading on my main account for two weeks,
00:59:52 because I got this Mumkey's Declassified Sharia Law Survival Guide video and I'm going to take
00:59:58 the Internet by storm. Here. Here's hoping for 10 billion views and and and a glorious new Caliphate
01:00:06 in the West. All right. So there you go. All right. Let's go to the questions already. Let's
01:00:12 let me only do the search thing. Okay. Hashtag as PCP. By the way, you guys can feel free to do
01:00:19 this as well if you want. I know Mumkey does sometimes. Yeah, you tagged me in the tweet.
01:00:22 So now I'm getting all these notifications. So thanks for that. You're anytime, dude.
01:00:26 Okay. Here's a question from Shade. I don't know if you guys have ever heard of this guy.
01:00:30 No. A little known guy. He wants to know, why does Jess hate spiders so much?
01:00:36 Oh, what am I tweeting about this this morning or something? That's probably why he's asking.
01:00:40 Oh, these people are so fucking unoriginal and reactionary, you know, just because that was Shade.
01:00:46 Who fucks Shade? That's didgy's little brother. That's MC Shadu. Yeah, that's MC Shadu. This
01:00:52 must be a different shade. Oh, how many shades are there? I don't know. 50 shades of gray,
01:00:59 you could say. I hate spiders because spiders are fucking ugly. They're monstrous. They're
01:01:04 hideous. They're gay. They're cretins. They're scum. They have no fucking backbones literally
01:01:10 and figuratively. They're weak. And, you know, people say they're not dangerous,
01:01:16 but that doesn't mean they're not evil. If you take the smallest, most harmless spider,
01:01:21 if they were bigger, if they were big enough to eat you, it would. So, you know, spiders are evil
01:01:26 and they're ugly. They've got too many eyes and too many legs. They've got tiny little hairs,
01:01:31 and they crawl on you. They get on you. They get in your hair. They spin webs. The webs are gross.
01:01:36 Do I really even need to justify this? Fuck spiders. You know what? Even Ronda Rousey could
01:01:43 beat a spider. That's how much I don't respect spiders. People always make the case that like,
01:01:49 yeah, but spiders eat other bugs. They eat mosquitoes and they eat flies and they eat other
01:01:54 shit. I'll just kill them myself. I'll just kill them myself. Yeah, well, what kind of defense is
01:01:58 that? They're worse than the things they eat. I would rather have a mosquito on me than a spider.
01:02:04 You know what? That's actually a tough one because I hate mosquitoes so much. I hate them
01:02:11 more than spiders for sure. I want every mosquito in the fucking world destroyed. They are,
01:02:15 they are going to kill us one day. Mosquitoes are going to be the downfall of humanity because
01:02:19 they're going to suck blood out of some fucking super AIDS boys. They're going to transport it all
01:02:24 over the fucking world. I don't care if they revive the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. I don't care.
01:02:28 That's not good enough. That's the only thing that a mosquito has ever done that was even a slight
01:02:32 positive. They're evil. I fucking hate mosquitoes. So I'm on Team Spider, I guess. I respect mosquitoes
01:02:42 a little bit more because when a mosquito lands on you, like, yeah, it's annoying, but you only
01:02:46 have to feel it landing on you. When a spider lands on you, you have to feel every leg crawling up
01:02:51 you slowly. Like, it's just, it's just touching you a thousand times as opposed to a mosquito,
01:02:56 which touches you once. I mean, that's true. I'll say touching a spider web is worse than
01:03:01 touching any of these things. I'd rather fucking die than walk through the forest and get a big
01:03:05 spider web in my face. And if there's bugs in there, then you're even more fucked. Well, the,
01:03:09 the only reason that I get freaked out by that because of the, is because of the presence of
01:03:13 the bugs in the spider web. But I guess that's kind of your point. So yeah, yeah, that's pretty
01:03:18 shit. Like, I freak out because I'm like, assume there's a spider on me now. So really, the problem
01:03:22 is the spider. Spider web is cool. I just think the spider, the web itself feels all silky and
01:03:27 gross and sticky on your face. And I just, I just wanted to walk through the woods and,
01:03:30 and peek on this bath house over there. And now I got to worry about this shit. And you know,
01:03:35 all the spider fags are always like, oh, spider silk is a thousand times stronger than steel.
01:03:39 But how come I destroy it effortlessly with every fucking, checkmate, checkmate,
01:03:44 mother fuckers. Fuck, fuck, fuck all, fuck all spiders, fuck that slut Charlotte.
01:03:49 Fuck that fucking, fuck that French bitch in James and the Giant Peach. I don't even care.
01:03:54 I would. I don't care how sexy her face is. The rest of her is an abomination.
01:03:59 Yo, you know who's hot rock, rock and arrow from Monster Musume? She's the best girl. She's
01:04:02 fucking, I would sex. The only good spider is spider man. And the good part of him ain't the
01:04:06 spider part. It's the man part. It's the man. The muscles and the dong.
01:04:13 Spider dong. No, it's. All right, Justin, I got another question for you. I'm glad you two are
01:04:21 here because you tour the, the PCP experts on this subject. Mark Morella wants to know,
01:04:26 what is the bare minimum age to count as sex with the young? The minimum age. It's not,
01:04:33 it's not a, it's not an age. There is no minimum. It's a state of mind.
01:04:37 That's true. Like when you got, when you got your choice as, you know, 45 year old milk,
01:04:41 if you got her dressed up in her baby bib and her diaper, that my friend is some,
01:04:45 is some old school sex with the young right there. That is the official,
01:04:49 fucking the, the non-incriminating stance. It's all in the mind. Just like, just like,
01:04:58 just like my hero. Just like my older person who is retarded. Does that count?
01:05:01 Yeah, that'll count. You know, if they act like a baby, if they look like a baby and they act
01:05:06 like a baby and they smell like a baby, then it's sex with the young. Just like my hero,
01:05:10 chop, chop, master onion said. Yeah. Sex with the young. It's all in the mind.
01:05:17 What a hero. My hero. I've got a question here from a Theo at pterodactyl says,
01:05:24 should entertainers bring their girlfriends along for the ride? No. What are you guys?
01:05:30 Absolutely not. And that might seem hypocritical coming from me, but here's the thing. I gave her
01:05:36 her own channel. Now I only put her on my channel when I need a woman and she's like the closest
01:05:41 one near me. I'm not bringing her along for any ride. I'm giving her her own platform on
01:05:45 Sheepover. Go check it out. I'm going to post a link down in the comments.
01:05:49 You ain't going to give your girlfriend a ride. I'll give her a ride. You know what I'm saying?
01:05:53 You know what I'm saying? My dude. Now, yeah, I pretty much think that's totally appropriate.
01:05:58 Yeah. If you're, if you're already doing something and you're just trying to like,
01:06:00 like the whole Yoko Ono situation is like the classic one. You don't just insert your bitch
01:06:05 into like the thing that's already going on. If you want to make something new,
01:06:08 like what Ben's doing with his new channel, with his girlfriend, that's a okay. That's perfect.
01:06:12 That's exactly the right thing to do. If you, if you got two creative people and they want to be
01:06:15 doing stuff, just, yeah, just don't fuck up the shit that's already there. I will only time
01:06:19 defend my use of girls and my videos thusly. Sometimes I need to go outside and I need a
01:06:25 cameraman. I need someone to film me. That's the first reason. And the second thing is that when
01:06:30 I do like stuff like my panel cast, you know, uh, the, the, my girl is like, she knows about
01:06:36 comics. So I at least keep her where she belongs on a thing that is in her field.
01:06:42 You know, I, I assumed that she was not going to be any kind of expert when you first started
01:06:47 the panel cast and said she was going to be on. I was like, Oh boy, here we go. But then she was
01:06:51 like more knowledgeable than you in some ways. And uh, that was, yeah, she's a solid asset.
01:06:57 She's reasonably vital to that endeavor. And I was just going to clarify. The only time you're
01:07:03 going to see a girlfriend on my main monkey channel is when I need a woman to be used as a prop.
01:07:08 That's all she is to me is a fucking prop. Excellent. Excellent. And you know,
01:07:12 uh, what Jesse was saying, uh, yeah, like, uh, I hate that I have to make all my shit by myself
01:07:18 like, cause I always want to do live action stuff and it's really fucking annoying and I've
01:07:21 adapted. So it's not a big deal now, but like, uh, God, I would fucking love to do more live
01:07:27 action shit. Like you, like you're fucking Zelda video, Jesse, which I assumed you filled with,
01:07:30 with flusie all over the place. It was great. It was, uh, it was awesome. If I had a, if I had a
01:07:34 person around to do that with, I totally would. God damn our, our let's plays just a whole lot
01:07:39 easier to make when you've got someone to bounce off of and converse it with. You know what? In fact,
01:07:43 I take back my whole stands. You should always have a second person. Put all your girlfriends,
01:07:49 all your boyfriends, all your friends in there, put your whole family in your videos, make a whole,
01:07:53 a whole production out of it. That's how you get the real good content. That's how you get the
01:07:56 YouTube success and the YouTube bucks. You got to have a bunch of people working for you,
01:08:00 for nothing, for peanuts. Yeah, you trip them into it with relationships. That's what you,
01:08:05 that's what relationships for. You seduce someone into helping you work. There you go.
01:08:11 The main issue people have is when, like with the Beatles, you get your girlfriend in there and
01:08:15 then like Nate was saying, they completely change the content. Like for example with,
01:08:19 with AVGN, he got his, his wife involved as a producer on the movie. And then the movie ends
01:08:24 with like the other guy getting the girl for no reason. Yeah. It should have been fucking James,
01:08:29 right? Why the fuck didn't he fuck that bitch? The girl didn't even talk to the black guy,
01:08:33 the whole movie, and then they're kissing at the end. Well, okay. The movie should not have had the
01:08:37 girl or the black guy at all. They were totally worthless characters. That's a given.
01:08:43 I did not see it, but I mean, you know, for all we know, I mean, I don't know shit about these guys
01:08:48 or about the production of the movie, but like from what I've heard, it sounds like, like, like
01:08:51 Bumpy was saying, the, the wifey here, she had some input. She had some like, she made some changes
01:08:56 along the way and who the fuck knows exactly how drastic those were, what they were at some point.
01:09:00 Yeah, you really, if you're a creator, do not let, but it's kind of inevitable because like,
01:09:04 whatever people you hang around are going to change the way you think. Like your, your friends,
01:09:09 to some degree, define how you think and like, what do you think is acceptable. That's why we're
01:09:12 all so angry all the time. That's right. We always talk to PCP guys all day. So if, like, if you're
01:09:19 just like some dude from the Midwest or whatever, and you move to California, like you're gonna adopt
01:09:23 that mindset over some, it's gonna happen. Like, like Tim Heidecker, I think is kind of an example
01:09:28 of that. He's just getting more and more, you know, he moved to Hollywood and he's just getting more
01:09:33 and more, you know, liberal. And yeah, I don't, I don't really begrudge him. I disagree with him
01:09:37 on some of his points, but you know, that's fine. But you can see his mind changing. You can see
01:09:41 those changes happening. And like the thing with Yoko was like, she actually wasn't really,
01:09:46 as far as I know, I'm no expert on this, but she wasn't like forced into like the Beatles or anything.
01:09:51 It's not like Lenin was trying to bring her in to like change the Beatles. But what she definitely
01:09:56 did was change John himself. And so like he, and like, it's, it's hard to say like, what are you
01:10:01 gonna do? Like tell your friends, like break up with his girlfriend? She changed him from a serial
01:10:05 wife-beater into a guy who respected his spouse. What a fucking bitch. How could she do that? That
01:10:11 was a big problem. If he ruins the music, then it's a terrible thing on the face of mankind.
01:10:16 Yeah, yeah, can't disagree with that. But you know, Yoko Ono makes some good stuff, dude.
01:10:20 I loved her, her latest album, which I believe was called like,
01:10:26 do you ever listen to her perform live? She's a fucking nightmare. But anyway,
01:10:30 you know, it really grinds my gears. You know, when it's just really gratuitous and transparent,
01:10:37 how like guys will be like, oh, I'm, this is my show, and here's my girlfriend now. And it's like,
01:10:43 it's almost like they're using her as like, like a sports car or a trophy to like show off.
01:10:47 Dude, not to- I can have sex with girls. I've got a hot girl.
01:10:52 You know, to some degree, there's always going to be a little bit of bullshit. Like,
01:10:55 if you get a girlfriend and for whatever reason, you're talking about something
01:10:58 where it's relevant. And even when you do that little mention, because it's pertinent to what
01:11:02 you're talking about, there's going to be some people who are like, oh, here we go. We're shoving
01:11:06 in the whole girlfriend thing. But to some degree, it's unavoidable. That's the takeaway. Just keep
01:11:10 it relevant. Don't be gratuitous and transparent and gay with it. Don't be gay in general. If you've
01:11:16 got, you know, nobody wants to be that couple. Just don't do it. You know, you know what this
01:11:21 reminds me of? Did you guys ever see probably not fucking Jeff's videos where he started having
01:11:27 his girlfriend wear his merch and shit? I'm just saying. Yeah, he was playing it off as a joke,
01:11:34 but still. I've never watched a Jeff video ever. And I think I can- You gotta take the monkey
01:11:42 approach. Only put your girlfriend in the video if the whole joke is that you're abusing her and
01:11:46 that she's too stupid to think of groceries. That really is like the funny way to go. Like,
01:11:51 nobody is- if you're a comedy boy, nobody's laughing if you're showing off your girlfriend,
01:11:55 just like, just showing her off. Like, that's not funny. And people would be like,
01:11:58 what the fuck? You're wasting my time bragging about the shit. So yeah, you got to make it funny
01:12:02 like Mumki did, which was great. The wife abuse thing was wonderful. Okay, here's another question
01:12:08 at GregBerryAnt asks, how do you keep yourselves motivated enough to work for more than a few
01:12:15 hours without taking a break? I constantly get distracted. And I have a- This is a question that-
01:12:21 So it's really funny to me, this question. Like, motivation questions. When I was young,
01:12:26 I had such a hard time focusing. And I was never able to concentrate very long on anything. And
01:12:32 even when I was in college, and I was starting to do things that I sort of liked, which was game
01:12:37 design, even then I found it agonizing to force myself to like, oh fuck, okay, I'll try to do
01:12:43 a puzzle design today or whatever, or program this thing. So things were getting a little better.
01:12:48 But what I found is, like, I didn't level up or- or increase my skill at this at all. The only
01:12:55 thing I ever did to get better at this was just find things that I inherently liked doing. It was-
01:13:00 I basically cheated the system. I just kept looking around until I just found out like, you know what?
01:13:05 I fucking love making videos. And like, during the TBAP days, when me and Ben would just like,
01:13:09 bust one out every week, and they were pretty fucking great. Like, it was so easy to just do
01:13:13 that because I really wanted to do it. So unfortunately, I don't have any practical advice
01:13:18 for this, but I would say just find something that you actually like doing. And maybe it's just a
01:13:22 like a variation on what you're trying to do now. That's all I got. Maybe you guys have some more
01:13:27 useful answers to this. How do you stay motivated? It was basically like, how do you stay motivated
01:13:33 without fucking getting distracted or taking a break? Oh shit, I'm the wrong fucking guy to
01:13:39 answer that one. I think what helps me is that I am a bit of a fame whore. And the whole time
01:13:45 I'm thinking, oh man, if I put this up, it's gonna get seen by at least 5,000 people, baby,
01:13:50 gotta get this sucker out. So if you're like an up and comer and you have no audience, I can imagine
01:13:55 it's very hard to be motivated to work because you feel like you're doing all this work for
01:14:00 literally nobody because nobody's watching. So if that's this guy's case, which I don't know who
01:14:04 he is, if that's your case, I can't help you. I have no idea what you can do. Well, you know,
01:14:09 I think it makes it keep your eye on the prize is what you're saying, right? You just just imagine
01:14:13 even if you're not like immediately getting, I guess what you're talking about like instant
01:14:16 gratification, right? You put it up and bam, 5,000 people see it feels good. You get those responses,
01:14:21 get those upvotes. It's nice. Like get those down votes if you're doing a podcast with Psy,
01:14:26 which is better than an upvote because that means it's not that they're supporting me with a little
01:14:31 click is that they're going against Psy with a click, which feels much better. You know what I
01:14:35 would say? I would just say like, you just got to value what you're doing. Like when I started
01:14:40 like my current channel best guy ever, like the the current login videos like literally six months
01:14:45 each to make them or no, the first one was three months, second one was six months and like at the
01:14:49 time at the time they got like way fewer views than they deserve. And now that I'm like growing a
01:14:53 little bit, they're starting to get more views. They're like basically 100,000 views, which is
01:14:57 like a healthy amount of views for like a lifetime. So I'm more happy with that. But at the time, like
01:15:03 what kept me going at the time was just how much I needed to complete this project. The project
01:15:09 itself is what made me want to keep going. And I felt there was an inherent value, a need that was
01:15:14 served by me creating this thing. And I feel like it did that. And I feel like that's why people like
01:15:19 it. So like at later on, you can just do it for the for the views and for the clicks. But at the
01:15:24 very beginning, at least you have to have some sort of artistic vision, which which I would recommend
01:15:29 going for something like that. I don't know, that's work for me. But I'm sorry, totally cut Jesse off.
01:15:32 I never really feel like unmotivated. I think in terms of motivation, I'm always like, yeah,
01:15:39 I'm going to do what I want to do. Because that's I'm cool. And that's what I do. But I definitely
01:15:45 do get distracted a lot. I always am a working on like a like a dozen things at once. I've always
01:15:51 got a bunch of Vegas windows open. And there's always like, like a like a new episode of a show
01:15:56 that I want to watch or like a podcast. And then you once you start watching something,
01:16:00 you fall into a hole and you start watching, you know, you just fall into like a YouTube hole,
01:16:04 or like you lay down on the couch once, once you're on the couch, it's fucking over. The day is
01:16:08 over. That's a trap. So um, you know, it's hard to stay focused sometimes. So a couple of months
01:16:17 ago, I tried Adderall for the first time. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That worked out. Yeah. Like,
01:16:24 and I was sold at like, Oh, this is a, this is a, is a, is a drug. It's not for you. It's
01:16:29 illegal that I'm selling you this. It's, you know, you should be taking this, but it will make you
01:16:33 like super focused and super, you know, into your work. And I'm like, okay, I'll take it. And I took
01:16:38 one. And like, it definitely worked. But like the thing is, it didn't feel like I've achieved
01:16:44 like a, a different state. It felt like maybe I'm supposed to be on Adderall. Maybe this is how
01:16:50 I'm supposed to be working. So that's my advice is just take Adderall. Take Adderall. Yeah.
01:16:57 You know, I mean, Nate, you're laughing, but I, I'd back up that recommendation. I took
01:17:02 Adderall once in high school and I was in pre-calc and I couldn't figure out this
01:17:06 fucking pre-calc shit. I took one Adderall and I taught myself that, that whole chapter in less
01:17:11 than 20 minutes. Is that true? Is that actually true? I could, I could feel like my brain was a
01:17:16 fucking locomotive. I could feel the engine of the train revving in my brain. I could physically feel
01:17:21 it. And it felt great. I laughed just cause it's funny. But no, I'm actually, I'm totally on board
01:17:27 for any of these kind of like, like treating the human body as like an engineering problem to be
01:17:31 solved with like fixes or drugs or like, but yeah, you start like, you start speed forcing and burst
01:17:36 slinking. You can like, you can do anything when you're on Adderall. It's a miracle, Drake. You
01:17:41 know, we've done, we've done so many episodes of this show, like giving advice to up and coming,
01:17:45 like aspiring creators who look up to us, but all our advice was wrong. The only advice that
01:17:50 matters, if you take anything from this podcast, just take Adderall. Yeah. The only reason I don't
01:17:58 wholeheartedly agree is because, because I'm, I'm, I'm engineering focused. If the Adderall
01:18:04 perhaps introduces other issues, for example, just one that's possible is if taking Adderall
01:18:09 gives you this high of ability to create stuff, that there will follow, of course, a subsequent
01:18:14 low where you're off of it. And will that make you like unable to function without it at that
01:18:19 point? Or like, yeah, I know I'm not being fun. I'm being serious right now, but like, um, yeah,
01:18:24 you know, I didn't take it enough to get addicted. Yeah, luckily, I'm so, if it's possible to just
01:18:28 be on, if it's possible to just take Adderall, I can only afford like two pills a month. So,
01:18:33 well, that's good. If it's possible to like, for everyone to be on Adderall all the time, and
01:18:38 literally all it does is make everyone better at everything, then I would be 100% on board. But
01:18:43 yeah, I just got to watch out for those consequences. That's all. Yeah. That's all. Well, I mean,
01:18:47 like, I, every time I write a script or record a let's play, I'm drinking. Am I going to be dependent
01:18:52 on drinking? Probably. But do I care? No. Well, I mean, if you don't care, that's fine.
01:18:57 I'll just keep drinking. I mean, rolling rock, I got it because I was like, oh, AVGN, he's pretty
01:19:02 funny. Maybe this is magic funny juice. And it actually takes, it tastes exactly like water,
01:19:08 but has all the benefits of alcohol. So I really, I endorse rolling rock. If you can't afford Adderall,
01:19:14 go get some rolling rock. It's great. And if you can afford them both, then yes, definitely mix them,
01:19:19 mix as much as you can. Just grab everything from daddy's medicine cabinet, throw it all in a big
01:19:26 tincture and mix it up. Just mix depressants and narcotics together all the fucking day.
01:19:32 Don't do that. Don't die. If you want to die, at least pledge to our patreons before you do.
01:19:38 That's smart. That's smart. Just be responsible with your money. Invest in your future.
01:19:44 All right. So there you go. That's that. Is there any other decent questions here? Let me see.
01:19:51 Oh my God. Here's one. Okay. This is actually very personal to me.
01:19:55 At Mozilla Fendicand. Hey, dude, what's going on? I asked, so what are good ingredients to put in
01:20:00 oatmeal? I'm trying to become more of a healthy boy. Dude, I eat oatmeal every breakfast of my
01:20:06 fucking life. I am a fucking oatmeal expert. And I know exactly what you need to put in your oatmeal
01:20:10 to make it delicious. Okay. Here's what I'm doing right now. I'm so, I'm so happy. I'm so excited.
01:20:14 He asked this question. Yes. I'm all about oatmeal. Okay. You get yourself a big bowl of you get,
01:20:19 you get the big thing from, from Quaker oats, the old fashioned oats. You pour a fucking cup
01:20:24 into a bowl. And here's what you do. You put frozen strawberries from the grocery store.
01:20:31 You just pour a whole, like a fucking, fuckload of those in there. You cover that thing. You want,
01:20:35 you want to have a lot because it's going to be, the taste is dependent on those. You just cover
01:20:39 that thing with water. You fucking, you pour the strawberries, pour water. It doesn't matter how
01:20:42 much. Just put a bunch, experiment until you get the right amount. Maybe you do a cup or whatever.
01:20:46 The strawberries have water in them already. And then you just microwave that. You do that for two
01:20:49 minutes. You stir it up. You put it back in and do another two minutes. And then bam, you got perfect
01:20:54 oatmeal. Now, if you are a weak boy, what you can do is you can just put some sugar in. I would
01:20:58 recommend like one tablespoon of sugar. That might be a little bit too much, but something like that.
01:21:03 And then you just mix it up and bam, that's immediately delicious and perfect. If you want to
01:21:07 be an even more of a madman, what you can do is you can put brown sugar in and butter. You could
01:21:13 just put brown sugar and butter. If you don't care about like, it's going to be more fatty this way,
01:21:16 more, more calories and shit. Brown sugar, butter, do all the same steps. Just don't put in the
01:21:20 strawberries. Or you can put the strawberries in. I guess that'd be fine too. Bam. There you go.
01:21:24 That's perfect. That's all you need to know, folks. That's the best way to eat oatmeal. I do it every
01:21:28 single day in my goddamn life, the strawberry one. And there you go. There's your solution. There you
01:21:33 go. All right, we're done. Do you guys have any oatmeal suggestions? No, I'm the kind of the little
01:21:38 dinosaur eggs in it. Yeah, that's really, fuck what I said. Just get the dinosaur eggs.
01:21:45 Okay, we're done. No more good questions. Thanks for the questions. Yeah, everyone's
01:21:51 going to piss out all this rolling rock I've been drinking the whole time. Wait, what is this?
01:21:57 No, this is a shitty question. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm going to ask this last question. At
01:22:03 Artmark88 asks, about the Wonder Woman film, do you think the area's reveal should have been
01:22:08 an end credit scene? No, it shouldn't have been in it at all. Yeah, it was terrible. Yeah,
01:22:13 it, yeah, I didn't, yeah. We already talked about this in the last episode, didn't we? Did we?
01:22:18 Did we talk about this? Fuck it? I don't, I don't know. Okay, fuck that. I don't know why I felt
01:22:21 like answering that. All right, forget it. Abort, abort question. Mark, you're dead to me. Okay,
01:22:25 here we go. We're all done. Thanks for listening, everybody. Make sure you send us more questions

01:22:54 today, Jess was offering to beat up people's dads. If you want your dad beat up possibly from
01:22:59 Discord, throwing a buck or two. Those people, they contributed to the podcast. And if your dad
01:23:04 is Ronda Rousey, you get into the Discord free because I really, I really want to crack at that
01:23:09 dad. If your dad is Ronda Rousey. So if Ronda Rousey wants to be in the Discord, she's in for
01:23:17 free. All right, Ronda, you're in, buddy. Okay, thanks for listening, everybody. We'll see you next
01:23:20 time. Bye.
