00:00:00 Hello everyone, welcome to the inaugural podcast from The Pro Crastinators.
00:00:05 I'm here with my internet friends. Everyone introduce yourselves.
00:00:10 I'm Digibro, and I, uh, spoke a lot of weed and promote Black stereotypes.
00:00:17 Yep, uh, who else?
00:00:21 I'm Hippocrit, I'm an African animal from the Africa, and I review video games.
00:00:29 I'm Ben Saint. I do a comic called The Vapors. Go read it.
00:00:36 Nice, and I guess I'll be Guy from Best Guy Ever. Go watch my YouTube anime videos, they're the coolest thing.
00:00:44 I'm so unsure of yourself.
00:00:45 Well, you know, it's one of those, I don't know. Anyway, so this is a new thing we're going to do.
00:00:50 We're doing podcasts on some general sort of theme that hasn't been decided yet,
00:00:55 but today we've got a topic, and our topic today is what constitutes a best game ever.
00:01:05 There was recently a poll on game facts, as there is like every five years or something for the best game of all time.
00:01:12 And so the first one to win in like 2005 or something was Final Fantasy 7,
00:01:18 and then the next one was Ocarina of Time, which are some of the two most beloved games ever.
00:01:23 And this year, to the surprise of all, Undertale, the new, that new meme game, Undertale, has taken the crown.
00:01:34 After being out for what, like three months or so?
00:01:36 Yeah.
00:01:37 And so, you know, it's quite an interesting situation. Possibly it was just rigged, but nonetheless raises some interesting questions.
00:01:46 Depends what you mean by rigged.
00:01:48 That's true. There's lots of ways to rig or not rig.
00:01:52 It was, it got won because of like rallying from Tumblr and other places.
00:01:58 Well, I mean, it really is.
00:01:59 Someone could have made a bot, but probably not.
00:02:02 I mean, it isn't.
00:02:03 I guess.
00:02:05 There's a conspiracy going on.
00:02:07 I guess.
00:02:09 Speaking as the only person in this group who actually votes in every game FAQs poll and has done so for fucking eight years.
00:02:18 I know that two days ago, there was a poll called, did the best game ever contest convince you to try Undertale?
00:02:26 Oh, cool.
00:02:27 The answers went, the first answer was it might have, but I already owned it before the contest started, which had 21% of the votes.
00:02:34 Yes, I picked it up after it was featured in the contest battles, had 3% of the votes, 3.8.
00:02:39 Some, somewhat, I might have to at least try out the demo now was 20.32%.
00:02:44 Not really, it's not my style of game, not something I'd ever get, it was 29.61%.
00:02:50 And no, and I refuse to ever buy it purely out of spite, got 24.71%.
00:02:55 So you're telling me that less than 50% of those people said they had played it or wanted to play it at all?
00:03:01 Yes.
00:03:02 That's, okay, that's extremely interesting.
00:03:05 You know what, it's the kind of game that lots of people wouldn't play anyway, so I don't think it's going to make any difference.
00:03:13 Well, I mean, okay.
00:03:14 For old Toby Fox.
00:03:16 I know, the whole popular opinion thing is just interesting, but really it's not the focus of what we're going to talk about here.
00:03:24 So, you know, to make a comparison between like the other two, like the games that had previously won the polls, Final Fantasy VII and Ocarina of Time,
00:03:32 are both like complete game changers at the time they were released, which was around the same time anyway.
00:03:39 Undertale could be real influential, but like time, we have to wait and see.
00:03:44 That's the thing.
00:03:45 Final Fantasy VII and Ocarina of Time were both like technical marvels, absolutely blew away anything else that had come out at the time in their own ways.
00:03:54 Undertale is like not at all that way technically, but you could certainly make a case that it is that way in terms of like narrative and storytelling and like game immersion, that sort of stuff.
00:04:08 That's all really vague shit you just said.
00:04:11 I know, I know it is.
00:04:12 It's totally vague and subjective, but that's, you know.
00:04:14 The thing about Undertale is that Undertale does a lot of things that are all very interesting, but I think it only actually does like one thing that's totally new, which is...
00:04:27 Does it do anything?
00:04:28 I don't know if it does anything that's totally new.
00:04:31 I think the only thing it does that's very new is offering the meta commentary on save scumming.
00:04:39 That I don't think there's ever been a game that weaves your save scumming into the narrative in a way that you are changing the story by resetting your save.
00:04:52 You know, spoiler alert for anyone who didn't know that about Undertale, but for fuck's sake, it's already won a best game ever, Poland.
00:04:59 It's a six hour game.
00:05:01 Fucking play it if you're interested at all.
00:05:03 Now, that's a very interesting point, and it certainly has a unique twist on it.
00:05:07 However, there have been games that incorporate the death mechanic into the gameplay, which is a very interesting way to go.
00:05:15 Yeah, but just incorporating death is like step one.
00:05:19 Incorporating the act of save scumming is like a next level beyond that.
00:05:24 Even if we talked about a game like Dark Souls where they have written death into the story, that if you give up playing, then it means you hollowed.
00:05:35 If you keep going, it means that you're continuing to be reincarnated.
00:05:39 But Dark Souls handles this by saving constantly.
00:05:42 There is no save scumming in Dark Souls.
00:05:45 It's always saving for you.
00:05:47 Whereas, I don't think I've ever heard of an RPG where you can restart and you can redo things, but the game is keeping track of it.
00:05:57 I think there might be other games that do keep track of that kind of thing, but not for the reasons that Undertale does.
00:06:06 Not for narrative reasons.
00:06:08 I don't think it's hugely important whether or not it was the first game to do it or not.
00:06:12 I think it's important.
00:06:14 Well, I would make the argument that it's much more about the sum of its parts and how it works.
00:06:21 No, if it did something before anyone else did it, that's important.
00:06:25 Okay, it deserves credit, but like long term, I don't really think that's...
00:06:31 I know it's important.
00:06:33 I just think that Undertale is much more than just any one of those mechanics.
00:06:36 Okay, well you're moving the goalpost, so I'm not saying it's whatever.
00:06:39 This is not an adversarial thing, Ben.
00:06:43 We're all friends here.
00:06:45 We're all friends, I'm telling you.
00:06:47 Fine, fine.
00:06:49 Okay, but I kind of don't want to go into too much specifics here,
00:06:55 because I'm currently making a video called Best Game Ever Undertale, so go watch it when it's up.
00:07:00 This was your podcast idea.
00:07:02 I know, I know.
00:07:04 And you don't have to release this before Best Game Ever Undertale if you don't want to.
00:07:08 Maybe I'll save it till afterward.
00:07:12 You know what? Okay, I'm gonna go with that.
00:07:14 I'm going full out with this.
00:07:19 The whole save scumming thing, and the way that the characters respond to it,
00:07:25 is definitely the most special thing about the game.
00:07:29 And the way that it...
00:07:31 Is it totally subjective?
00:07:35 Well, alright. Okay, I'm gonna...
00:07:37 Warning, these are just my opinions.
00:07:39 They are not facts.
00:07:41 I cannot validate them objectively.
00:07:43 Alright.
00:07:44 Why, Ben? Do you think there's something else that's more important?
00:07:47 Well, just because you said definitely.
00:07:48 Yeah, I don't...
00:07:49 Well, definitely to me.
00:07:50 Yeah, just because it innovates in that way,
00:07:52 doesn't mean it's the thing that recommends the game.
00:07:55 I wouldn't recommend that game to someone on the basis that it's meta about its save states.
00:08:02 I would recommend it on the basis that it's a good story,
00:08:05 and it's really hype, and it innovates in a number of ways, that being one of them.
00:08:09 Well, I would. I just wouldn't use those terms.
00:08:11 I'd say it's really good.
00:08:13 I mean, that's what I like about it.
00:08:14 I mean, in discussing why it's good, that would definitely come up.
00:08:18 Well, yeah, but I wouldn't really want to describe that to someone before they play it.
00:08:22 Okay, you know what? We're getting on to our topic here.
00:08:24 The focus here is to discuss what it means to be a best game of all time.
00:08:29 And what was the motivations people had for voting for it?
00:08:32 So, let's just talk about that now.
00:08:35 So, I mean, just comparing the winners of this poll,
00:08:38 there's the technical innovations,
00:08:42 and then there's the classics,
00:08:45 and then there's this one game that's been out for a couple months that is completely taken over.
00:08:48 Was it reasonable to vote Undertale as a best game ever?
00:08:53 I mean, obviously it was a popular...
00:08:55 Some people's favorite game of all time.
00:08:58 Okay, okay, that's true.
00:08:59 But will we look back on it in...
00:09:01 It's been like 20 years since Thomas VII and Ocarina of Time came out.
00:09:04 And that's the conversation that I've been having with the DeVue,
00:09:08 and I think you have as well.
00:09:10 Yeah, we probably should have just brought him in this, but...
00:09:13 Sorry, DeVue.
00:09:14 He can be on some other time.
00:09:16 That, like, yeah, it is the best game ever right now.
00:09:24 And it might not be six months from now.
00:09:27 Well, right now is when we're voting.
00:09:29 Right, exactly.
00:09:30 That's true, that's true.
00:09:31 That's the issue, that, like, this poll...
00:09:33 Because this poll only happens once every five years,
00:09:36 and I guarantee you that if Undertale had come out one year ago,
00:09:40 it would not have won this poll.
00:09:42 Yeah.
00:09:43 This poll happened at a time when this game was at maximum hype,
00:09:47 when the highest number of people possible care about it,
00:09:52 because it's had three months to build up, you know,
00:09:55 where, like, the initial fan base exploded,
00:09:58 more and more people care, more and more people are creating things,
00:10:02 and a lot of that, all the ideas that have been had by the Undertale fandom
00:10:07 have sort of been realized by now,
00:10:10 or they will be within the next few months,
00:10:12 and six months from now, it will not be hype like this.
00:10:16 There will probably be something else
00:10:18 that a lot of the people who were super into Undertale have gravitated towards,
00:10:22 you know, maybe a new season of Steven Universe or something,
00:10:26 or the next bomb from that, you know,
00:10:29 and people will be talking about something else,
00:10:33 and the specific circumstance of a best game ever poll happening
00:10:39 and then someone campaigning really hard to make that game win
00:10:44 would not have happened.
00:10:46 And, you know, when you look at the voting,
00:10:49 like the way it was going,
00:10:51 because I turned you guys on to the fact that it was in the running early on,
00:10:56 and it had narrowly beaten Mass Effect 3 at the beginning,
00:11:01 and I remember that my impression was like,
00:11:03 huh, Undertale won, but I had marked it as winning
00:11:07 just because no one likes Mass Effect 3.
00:11:09 It's a game that's widely disliked
00:11:14 by even fans of the franchise.
00:11:16 So Undertale winning against Mass Effect 3 was kind of reasonable,
00:11:19 but every single round, its margin got bigger,
00:11:23 and it was beating games that are more and more considered classics
00:11:27 that more and more people love by wider and wider margins.
00:11:30 Suddenly, it's beating Fallout 3, which is a game everyone loves,
00:11:34 and suddenly it's crushing Ocarina of Time in the last round.
00:11:39 The numbers were crazy by then.
00:11:43 And the fact that it so barely even beat Mass Effect 3
00:11:48 says to me that the game FAQs for people who would have voted for this
00:11:55 would not have voted for Undertale.
00:11:58 And no question, there was a surge of outside influence
00:12:01 for the normal voting.
00:12:03 And I think it speaks to the influence of Undertale's popularity right now
00:12:11 that no other game got.
00:12:14 Because obviously there was tons of people who were mad about it.
00:12:17 There was a huge counter move against Undertale,
00:12:20 but it didn't work against Undertale.
00:12:24 Love Trump's Hate, Hillary, 2016.
00:12:32 No one was building up a counter force of people voting for Ocarina of Time.
00:12:37 Right, certainly not in the numbers of the influence.
00:12:40 Because if Ocarina of Time was relevant enough right now
00:12:45 that it could have beat Undertale, then it would have beat Undertale,
00:12:48 because there would have been enough people going,
00:12:50 no, Ocarina of Time is still the greatest game ever,
00:12:53 and after fighting it.
00:12:55 Well, you gotta ask yourself,
00:12:58 you gotta look at who's voting in the poll
00:13:01 and what percentage of them are making a legitimate vote based on favorite game,
00:13:05 and who's just coming in specifically.
00:13:08 Oh, someone told me to vote for Undertale to mess this thing up.
00:13:12 So it doesn't necessarily say anything about Ocarina.
00:13:16 I kind of agree.
00:13:18 Yeah, Ocarina could have been, if popular enough,
00:13:24 that that might have happened,
00:13:26 and the fact that it doesn't say that Ocarina maybe isn't that relevant,
00:13:30 or whatever, compared to Undertale.
00:13:33 You know, there was that post one of you guys linked,
00:13:37 of the guy who said that, like,
00:13:41 he said something to the effect that he voted for Undertale
00:13:44 just because he didn't want the same old games to be winning again and again.
00:13:48 Yeah, right, right.
00:13:50 And just it feels that way too.
00:13:52 And all I could think was, you know, noble goal,
00:13:55 why didn't you vote for Dark Souls, the actual best game ever?
00:14:00 Yeah, I think that Dark Souls,
00:14:03 and this gets to the heart of kind of what I want to talk about,
00:14:06 you know, what exactly makes a best game ever.
00:14:09 And I really think that something like Dark Souls,
00:14:12 I absolutely love Undertale, I'm crazy about it right now,
00:14:16 though the fan base, I find a bit obnoxious these days,
00:14:19 but Dark Souls has not only completely changed the game of making games,
00:14:28 it's had a huge influence, and nobody expected it.
00:14:32 And there's just, there's like a post and pre Dark Souls World,
00:14:37 and it's one of those milestone games,
00:14:40 like Final Fantasy VII, like Ocarina of Time.
00:14:42 Maybe we'll be saying the same thing about Undertale in a year.
00:14:45 Right, that's true, we might.
00:14:47 And you know, this is only my opinion, but we don't know.
00:14:51 It seems to me too early to say.
00:14:53 I don't think I could honestly make a case that I think it's the best game ever.
00:14:57 I can't help the feeling for me personally,
00:15:01 that like, if Undertale is bringing in a new revolutionary idea,
00:15:08 then it's not the game that's gonna have done it the best.
00:15:11 You know, like, I think if there's a game that takes the ideas of Undertale,
00:15:15 and then does it in the full package,
00:15:20 where it's not like an 8-bit indie game,
00:15:23 and it's not like 6 hours long,
00:15:26 and you know, and really, like, while the...
00:15:30 I don't know that I agree with you.
00:15:32 Hang on, here's where I'm going to completely 100% disagree,
00:15:36 because in no way do I think a game has to be anything more than the presentation Undertale has.
00:15:41 I think a game could look exactly like Dwarf Fortress,
00:15:44 and be the best game of all time, if it was built in such a way.
00:15:48 I just don't agree with the whole idea of a best game.
00:15:52 Like, I either want to play it, or I don't.
00:15:55 That's how I see it.
00:15:57 Like, it's good because I remember the fun times I had playing it,
00:16:02 and or I want to play it again right now.
00:16:06 Having like a best is just sort of pointless.
00:16:09 It's entirely masturbatory, that's true.
00:16:12 It's also as pointless as having scores.
00:16:14 They're kind of a little bit more helpful, but it all still boils down to
00:16:18 do I want to play it, yes or no?
00:16:20 Yeah, like, look at the poll.
00:16:22 Final Fantasy 7 one, then Ocarina one.
00:16:24 Like, they'd both been out the whole time.
00:16:26 Only thing to change was people's opinions,
00:16:28 and that's just how it's going to be forever.
00:16:30 Well, for me, I love having a best,
00:16:33 and I like having a most favorite thing, because...
00:16:38 It's very fun to...
00:16:39 I can look at it, and I can say, like, this explains my taste.
00:16:45 You know, like, this explains what I want.
00:16:47 This is what I want games to be.
00:16:49 Like, for me, I consider Dark Souls to be the best game ever,
00:16:53 because, like, it represents everything I value in video games.
00:16:57 It has, you know, it's a game that, at the same time,
00:17:02 has a deep and involving narrative,
00:17:04 but one that you can engage with on your own terms.
00:17:08 It has, it incorporates the way that you play the game
00:17:11 into the narrative and style of the game,
00:17:15 where, you know, if you die, that's part of the narrative.
00:17:17 If you give up playing, that's part of the narrative, you know?
00:17:20 There's nothing that you can do in the game
00:17:23 that would break your immersion with the game,
00:17:26 other than, like, glitches and stuff, you know?
00:17:29 Which that's super important.
00:17:31 I think that's what really makes Dark Souls a greatest game contender.
00:17:36 Like, that's what I really value in games.
00:17:38 Well, you know, I just want to throw out there.
00:17:40 That's fine, but I'm 13,
00:17:43 and my favorite game is Call of Duty Black Ops 2,
00:17:46 because it's the game I play every single day for six hours after school,
00:17:50 and I get more enjoyment out of that than anything else in the world.
00:17:53 But, I mean, and yeah, that's fair.
00:17:55 Yeah.
00:17:56 And, again, I think if we're judging,
00:17:59 if we're saying best game ever is anything other than personal opinion,
00:18:03 that just means it's consensus, right?
00:18:05 And that's the answer to our whole,
00:18:07 that we just answered the question of this whole discussion here.
00:18:10 It's consensus, there is no objective...
00:18:12 Well, podcast over.
00:18:14 Go on, Digi.
00:18:16 Yeah, well, you know, I think, yeah,
00:18:20 the reason Undertale wins in this contest is that, right now,
00:18:24 there's enough people who care about it,
00:18:26 but that's the funny thing.
00:18:28 And those people are able to galvanize votes,
00:18:30 because I bet a lot of those people, you know.
00:18:32 But that's the funny thing about it, though,
00:18:34 is that, like, six months later, if you ran this poll again,
00:18:38 it won't be Undertale.
00:18:40 And you have to wonder, like...
00:18:42 I think what that does is it puts into perspective
00:18:46 how, like, how subject to change the idea of the best is,
00:18:51 because, like, I think on-game FAQs,
00:18:55 as someone who's been on there for a long time,
00:18:58 like, the Legend of Zelda franchise and anything by Square Enix
00:19:03 are extremely overpowered for these contests.
00:19:06 They are franchises which people have set in their mind long ago
00:19:12 that they are the best thing ever,
00:19:14 and they will continue to vote that they are the best thing ever.
00:19:17 You know, like, the fact that fucking The Legend of Zelda,
00:19:21 a link to the past, beat Dark Souls in this whole,
00:19:24 you know, this game that is, what, God,
00:19:28 nearly 30 years old?
00:19:30 No, it can't be 30.
00:19:32 20 years, around 20 something years old.
00:19:35 And it's a game that literally every Zelda since
00:19:39 has iterated on and improved on, you know.
00:19:42 Every 2D Zelda has tweaked the controls to be a little better,
00:19:46 has tweaked the way the world building is a little better.
00:19:49 Every 3D Zelda game has used the same formula,
00:19:52 has used the same, you know, structure.
00:19:54 Well, you could say it's attachment to the original,
00:19:56 the, you know, originator of the formula.
00:19:58 You could, but like, I just think that,
00:20:02 that that game is like, it makes it that far,
00:20:06 mostly because people think it's a link to the past,
00:20:10 it's the classic, it's the original,
00:20:12 it's, you know, automatically great,
00:20:14 but not because they would actually play it today
00:20:17 and it would be their favorite game, you know.
00:20:19 Sure, yeah.
00:20:20 I think people voted up because it's the OG
00:20:25 and not because they legitimately think
00:20:27 that it's a better game than Dark Souls, you know.
00:20:29 Well, that makes me, that reminds me,
00:20:32 I want to go back to your point that in the future,
00:20:36 games may iterate on Undertale's ideas and do them better.
00:20:41 Because I don't think that's necessarily the case
00:20:44 because the thing, because like, like Guy was saying before,
00:20:48 the things that Undertale did better than anything else
00:20:51 were not technical things, they were creative things.
00:20:54 And they were, and anything technical that was going on there
00:20:58 was done in service of its particular narrative.
00:21:01 And so I'm not sure that's the kind of thing
00:21:03 that can actually be improved upon in like, any measurable way.
00:21:08 And only in an artistic way, which is entirely subjective, yeah.
00:21:12 I could see that, I guess for me,
00:21:18 because out of anyone in this call,
00:21:21 I am the least impressed with what Undertale is.
00:21:24 Because for me, like my biggest problems with this game were like,
00:21:30 I appreciate like the graphics and everything,
00:21:34 but to me they felt like a limitation.
00:21:36 It didn't feel like this was the ideal presentation.
00:21:40 No, absolutely not.
00:21:42 You're completely a limitation.
00:21:44 Look, the great things about Undertale were like,
00:21:47 like the resetting and the keeping in memory of the things you've done
00:21:52 and the way that it closes itself when you like lose to Flowey later on.
00:21:57 And the way the game, you know, permanently fucks up everything
00:22:02 if you do the genocide route and then try to do it again.
00:22:05 None of those are particularly impressive feats of programming
00:22:08 or game development, but to apply the ideas
00:22:13 in those kinds of meaningful ways shows just the creativity of Toby and all that good stuff.
00:22:20 Some of the art in the game is bad,
00:22:23 and that's because it was done by Toby before he got kickstarted
00:22:27 and had the money to pay artists.
00:22:29 That I think is a limitation, but like the fact that it's 2D pixel graphics
00:22:33 and you know, like white enemies in the Blackfield,
00:22:35 I don't think those are limitations.
00:22:37 I think even with all the money in the world, it would have still had that aesthetic.
00:22:40 I have no problem with 2D pixel art,
00:22:43 but if you went and played like a old, like let's say Super Nintendo game,
00:22:49 like Super Metroid or even, well, I guess Mario RPG wouldn't really be 2D pixel art per se,
00:22:56 but like they're really nice looking games that hold up really well.
00:23:01 The game that always comes to mind for me is like a Valkyrie profile for the PS1.
00:23:08 That game has like these luscious environments, gorgeous pixel art,
00:23:12 or if you were going modern, Muramasa or like Skullgirls or something,
00:23:18 like do you think that Undertale would not be better if it had the art budget to be a beautiful 2D game?
00:23:27 That's fair, and you can improve the art of anything?
00:23:30 I don't really think it would be any better.
00:23:32 Well, that's exactly what I was going to say.
00:23:34 What I really care about is the ideas,
00:23:37 you've got a sprite that conveys the idea that this is Heath's Flamesman.
00:23:41 Do not forget his name.
00:23:42 What if you had the exact same game?
00:23:45 All the ideas are the same, but the graphics are better.
00:23:48 I'll give it to you.
00:23:49 That would be better, I guess.
00:23:51 I guess that'd be better.
00:23:52 Would you say Hippo?
00:23:54 I don't like good graphics.
00:23:56 Yeah, I agree.
00:23:58 I mean, the best looking place in the game is the core.
00:24:02 The core has all these really fancy cloud effects and lighting effects
00:24:05 and everything looks really nice and crisp and shiny,
00:24:08 and I don't like it any more than the ruins,
00:24:11 which is like 2D, piece of crap drawn by a totally isn't an artist.
00:24:14 See, I feel the opposite.
00:24:15 I thought the ruins looked like shit,
00:24:17 and I didn't feel invested in the game yet because it looked like shit.
00:24:20 They do look like shit, but in a way that I'm totally fine with.
00:24:23 The thing that bothered me the most in Undertale design-wise
00:24:26 is that the whole game to me felt like a very long horizontal hallway,
00:24:34 because you always see, especially in the ruins,
00:24:38 you continually see a black border,
00:24:41 like you are walking through a tunnel that exists in a void.
00:24:45 In my mind, I'm picturing, like, designing this map
00:24:51 on the backdrop of nothingness,
00:24:54 because you're drawing a tunnel through,
00:24:56 like you're just drawing a tunnel and putting a game in it.
00:24:59 I agree, and let me add to that
00:25:02 probably the worst thing for that,
00:25:04 and it's so bad that even I was slightly bothered by it,
00:25:07 is that in the very final area,
00:25:09 in the walk up to the last boss,
00:25:11 you're walking along this gray platform,
00:25:13 and around you is just blackness
00:25:15 with a couple of really shitty-looking stone buildings
00:25:19 copy-pasted in a perfect grid on either side of you,
00:25:23 and I think what it's supposed to be suggesting
00:25:25 is that you're walking through and or over a city,
00:25:28 but it really just looks like these rectangular things,
00:25:31 like stuck on a black background.
00:25:33 It really is terrible.
00:25:35 I think if this game didn't feel...
00:25:37 because the moments that it really sinks in
00:25:40 are when you backtrack or you go back and forth,
00:25:45 and you really feel this sense of,
00:25:47 like, this is just a left-to-right motion.
00:25:49 There's no... you never really go far, up and down.
00:25:52 You never really go much in opposite direction.
00:25:55 And I mean, that could be on some level symbolic
00:25:58 that this whole game is one long trip to the right, you know?
00:26:02 But, like, I just felt like if this world felt more integrated
00:26:07 and less like a hallway and more like a, you know,
00:26:11 maybe like a Zelda-type thing,
00:26:13 which even Zelda, you know, feels like a fucking square,
00:26:15 so, like, once you really explore the map.
00:26:17 Now, see, I'm glad we're talking about this
00:26:19 because none of this had the slightest bit
00:26:22 of detrimental effect to me in my experience.
00:26:24 I don't think...
00:26:26 Like, what Undertale is does not need to be an open world.
00:26:30 Like, the story Undertale is trying to tell
00:26:33 is successfully told via a hallway.
00:26:35 I don't think it needs to be open world,
00:26:37 but I think that the...
00:26:40 I think that by having...
00:26:42 if that black space off to the side was drawn in
00:26:46 and, like, you could tell that there's a world right outside
00:26:50 this hallway you're in,
00:26:52 then that would sell me on it more.
00:26:54 So, I've always been a big fan.
00:26:56 There are places where the art could have sold things a little better.
00:26:58 Here's a video game.
00:27:00 Here's an RPG conceit that always bothers me, right?
00:27:03 That the Final Fantasy games do this much better
00:27:06 than any other JRPGs, in my opinion.
00:27:09 I hate it when I show up in a town in an RPG
00:27:13 and there's five houses.
00:27:15 And, like, those five houses are the only relevant,
00:27:18 like, you know, people live there
00:27:20 and they sell items or whatever,
00:27:22 but I'm meant to believe that in this world,
00:27:25 there are towns that literally consist of five buildings
00:27:28 and five people, you know?
00:27:30 Even a game like Skyrim,
00:27:32 like, there's towns in that game where you'll show up
00:27:34 and it's, like, a handful of houses and that's it.
00:27:37 And because, you know, the limitations
00:27:39 of building a game with that system.
00:27:41 But if you look at a Final Fantasy game,
00:27:44 there's always a huge amount of city
00:27:47 that you're just not exploring.
00:27:49 Like, Final Fantasy IX especially, you know,
00:27:51 like, the actual gameplay takes place
00:27:53 within, like, three or four streets in that city.
00:27:56 But you can see this huge, sweeping city,
00:27:58 so you feel like it's a real living, breathing place
00:28:02 in this world, you know, that would make sense
00:28:05 whether it was a video game city or not.
00:28:08 And, like, I think Undertale could have had some of that
00:28:11 and I think it would have been better for it.
00:28:13 Well, Snowden was a pretty big town.
00:28:15 Yes, Snowden felt pretty good.
00:28:17 I like some of the areas where you do see more background,
00:28:21 you know?
00:28:23 Obviously, like Ben said, the grey area towards the end
00:28:26 could have looked better, but it did at least suggest
00:28:29 that there was this city you were walking over
00:28:32 and, like, that you were in a place,
00:28:34 that you were walking through a place, you know,
00:28:36 as opposed to, like, the part where you're in the caves
00:28:39 where you turn on the lights and everything
00:28:41 and it's just, like, suspended hallways in a black void,
00:28:45 you know, like, where is this? What is this?
00:28:48 Now, this isn't really an excuse for the game design,
00:28:50 but there is at least the idea that things were sort of
00:28:53 deliberately constructed in a, it's a lampshade hang, I guess,
00:28:57 that monsters love puzzles and, like, winding dungeons and things.
00:29:00 Yeah, the puzzles are definitely an element of that
00:29:03 and, like, the ruins are definitely designed
00:29:06 in a way that is like that
00:29:08 and is a single hallway full of puzzles
00:29:10 and the game, like, points that out for sure.
00:29:12 The caves, though, I don't think there's really any defense.
00:29:14 Well, you know, are the caves...
00:29:17 I don't know. I don't know, maybe.
00:29:19 I don't know if that excuse covers the caves and everything,
00:29:23 but, yes.
00:29:25 There's a lot of things about this game that are minimal
00:29:28 in a really good way that I don't think would have been better otherwise.
00:29:32 This game would not be better with voice acting.
00:29:34 Oh, certainly not. I don't think those games would.
00:29:36 The sound design is perfect because they used sound effects
00:29:41 that sound like the fonts that they're showing, you know?
00:29:43 The sound design is perfect.
00:29:45 The sound design is like...
00:29:47 I think the sound design might be the one thing about this game
00:29:50 that's, like, completely beyond reproach.
00:29:53 Yeah, I think the moment that...
00:29:56 Because, like, when I think about this game,
00:29:58 the dramatic moment in the game that sticks out the most to me
00:30:01 is when it says...
00:30:03 It's a dramatic moment where it says you are filled with determination,
00:30:06 but it spells it out one letter at a time with spaces between it.
00:30:10 You are filled with determination, and I was like...
00:30:14 I just remember feeling like, oh, fuck, yeah, you know what, I saw that,
00:30:18 and you could not have done that with voice acting or without text.
00:30:22 Along with the musical beat that plays at that moment.
00:30:25 It's like that...
00:30:34 Man, that fucking fight, dude.
00:30:36 I don't think the music could have been any better
00:30:40 Dude, these beats are banging, bro. These beats are off the charts.
00:30:44 They're radical.
00:30:46 I'm just saying that I think it is possible
00:30:49 for Undertale to have been a better game
00:30:52 just by having little things that it could have done,
00:30:55 like having more graphical budget
00:30:58 or a more imaginative layout of its world,
00:31:01 or just being able to spend maybe a little more time
00:31:05 with the characters and in the story
00:31:07 to really feel like you knew them and what they were about.
00:31:10 Here's another point that we've previously discussed,
00:31:12 which is, I mean, I would call Undertale a 10 out of 10 game for me.
00:31:16 And you convinced me previously that that doesn't mean
00:31:21 that it has to be perfect.
00:31:23 It's just one of those legendary games that you really love
00:31:26 and that you'd play again, and super good.
00:31:30 And so on that basis, and that applies to best game ever.
00:31:34 It could still be the best game ever, theoretically,
00:31:36 despite not being perfect.
00:31:38 It just can be topped.
00:31:40 If another game comes out that's even better,
00:31:42 then that has to be the best game ever.
00:31:44 That's absolutely possible, and that will always be possible.
00:31:47 I might be totally out of whack here.
00:31:50 I might be the only person in the world,
00:31:52 but I think maybe there are some technical things
00:31:56 that could have been improved on the graphics and the layouts.
00:32:00 I think the one thing that I actually would have preferred
00:32:03 to be a little different would be the writing.
00:32:06 Not in every way, but in certain parts,
00:32:11 where certain parts tried a little hard
00:32:15 through their writing to sell the emotional thing.
00:32:19 What's an example of that?
00:32:21 Mostly towards the end.
00:32:24 Just the sheer number of lines that Asgore gets as he's dying,
00:32:30 trying to sell him as the nicest guy.
00:32:33 And the sheer number of times that Azrael has to say,
00:32:37 like, why do I feel this way?
00:32:39 Why are you being so nice to me?
00:32:41 What's happening to my heart?
00:32:44 Here's a series of questions that were raised for me throughout the game.
00:32:50 When I'm going through the caves,
00:32:52 why does it just so happen that there's a bunch of text scrolls
00:32:56 on all the walls that just happen to be in order
00:32:59 and tell me the story of this world?
00:33:02 Oh, come on. That's totally understandable
00:33:04 that they record their history.
00:33:06 I don't have an answer for you.
00:33:08 Why do they record it that way, though?
00:33:10 It's a bunch of text scrolls in order just because you're passing through this area.
00:33:14 Or when you're on your way to Asgore
00:33:17 and you keep running into monsters
00:33:19 and each one is picking up the story where the last monster left off
00:33:23 and telling you what happened in the past,
00:33:25 which isn't even in character for these monsters,
00:33:28 for them to be telling you this part of the story
00:33:31 and speaking normally, you know?
00:33:34 Those little things took me out of it in a way
00:33:38 where I was like, this is a way too convenient way to do exposition,
00:33:42 to have it, you know, dimed out just right at the right pace,
00:33:46 but it's not in a way that makes sense in the context of what's actually happening.
00:33:51 I think that both of those things that you mentioned are like deliberately...
00:33:56 Okay, whether they're successful or not, I don't know,
00:33:59 but I think that those are both like deliberate immersion breaks.
00:34:02 That's possible.
00:34:04 With deliberate gamey moments.
00:34:06 With a scene like that, you're making a trade-off
00:34:08 of keeping the world feel 100% intact
00:34:11 to, in the case of the monsters delivering the lines,
00:34:14 which is one of my favorite parts in the whole game,
00:34:16 you're making a trade for an emotional payoff.
00:34:19 And in my personal opinion, I think it was totally worth it.
00:34:22 I like how this podcast has just become a review of Undertale.
00:34:26 Yeah, that's fine.
00:34:28 It's all to getting to the core of the matter here.
00:34:31 Well, I mean, at least we're still talking about what makes a good game.
00:34:34 Right.
00:34:35 Here's what I want to know, actually.
00:34:37 What I really want to ask each of you is that
00:34:40 if you got to choose the winner of Best Game Ever, what would you have picked?
00:34:45 Final Fantasy VII.
00:34:46 Like, and I can pick any game at all.
00:34:48 Yeah, you can pick any game. What would you pick as the winner of Best Game Ever?
00:34:52 That's a good question.
00:34:54 Hippo, do you have an answer?
00:34:56 Probably Dark Souls.
00:34:58 Cool.
00:34:59 Because I could play that over and over again forever.
00:35:02 Ben?
00:35:04 I mean, Dark Souls is a pretty strong contender.
00:35:09 Oh, God.
00:35:11 I came into this podcast about the Best Game Ever
00:35:14 without having prepared an answer to this question.
00:35:17 You know, now that I'm thinking about it,
00:35:20 I think right now I might fucking pick Undertale.
00:35:23 Yeah.
00:35:24 Even though I fucking railed against it
00:35:26 and was like, this is fucking bullshit.
00:35:28 It could never beat Final Fantasy VII.
00:35:30 It can't beat Ocarina of Time.
00:35:31 I think I might, right now I'm kind of feeling like
00:35:33 Undertale is like my favorite game ever.
00:35:35 You know, I'm kind of with you.
00:35:37 I think it needs some time to sit and like, you know,
00:35:42 we need the benefit of hindsight to really know if it's the best game ever.
00:35:46 But its pedigree is impressive
00:35:48 and its list of accomplishments is long.
00:35:51 I have always held like the idea that my favorite game
00:35:59 is whatever I can think of when somebody asks me that question.
00:36:03 Because I'm never thinking of it at any other point.
00:36:08 So it's just because something I...
00:36:11 I might have to, I might fit Binding of Isaac.
00:36:14 That's cool.
00:36:15 So that's your Call of Duty.
00:36:16 I fucking love Binding.
00:36:17 Yeah, it is.
00:36:18 But better.
00:36:19 That's fine.
00:36:20 I fucking love Binding of Isaac.
00:36:21 I think it's like a brilliantly designed game.
00:36:23 Well, let me...
00:36:24 It appeals to me in like every way that a game can.
00:36:27 I'm with you.
00:36:28 I love the shit out of it
00:36:29 to the point that I might even call it the best game ever.
00:36:31 My...
00:36:32 You know, I was thinking about this
00:36:34 and I talk about this in the review.
00:36:36 One of my...
00:36:37 Probably my favorite thing in a game
00:36:40 is that feeling of like slow progression
00:36:43 up to an ultimate SuperDuper awesome best ending ever.
00:36:48 And so like in that sense, like Chrono Trigger
00:36:51 is one that does that.
00:36:52 You can get like good endings along the way in various ways.
00:36:55 But if you really work at it
00:36:57 and really do the extra mile in the game,
00:36:59 you are rewarded with like the ultimate SuperDuper
00:37:01 best ending everything works out.
00:37:03 Another game like that is Radiant Historia.
00:37:07 And I really like it when they fake you out.
00:37:09 You get like a good ending, but it's not perfect.
00:37:11 And then you go investigate.
00:37:13 And you actually...
00:37:14 Both those games happen to be time travel games
00:37:16 like Undertale is.
00:37:17 It's a good formula for that, I guess.
00:37:19 And so you put in the work
00:37:20 and you get your best ending ever.
00:37:21 You don't have time to travel at Undertale.
00:37:22 Well, sure you do.
00:37:23 When you reset the game,
00:37:24 you're going back in time.
00:37:25 Oh, okay, sure.
00:37:26 But Undertale...
00:37:28 Man, Undertale does that too.
00:37:30 But like Undertale does that
00:37:32 to get the true pacifism ending.
00:37:38 The ending where you meet Azrael.
00:37:39 Like, that's where Chrono Trigger
00:37:42 or Radiant Historia ends.
00:37:45 They end with the Azrael fight.
00:37:47 But Undertale, in my opinion,
00:37:49 continues after that with a whole new thing
00:37:52 with the genocide ending.
00:37:53 And in playing that,
00:37:55 there's all this other shit
00:37:57 that comes out of the woodwork
00:37:58 that really puts it like way over the top
00:38:01 in its own category
00:38:02 in a way that no game I've ever played
00:38:04 has done before.
00:38:05 So it's like...
00:38:06 It gave me every single thing I wanted
00:38:09 and then just a fuckload more.
00:38:11 So, you know, there's nothing like it for me.
00:38:13 It was by far the most big life experience
00:38:18 out of probably any game I've ever played.
00:38:22 Yeah.
00:38:23 You know,
00:38:25 I kind of just want to go over all the reasons
00:38:27 that I don't love Undertale as much.
00:38:30 Sure.
00:38:31 What's your favorite game?
00:38:32 I think Undertale is great.
00:38:34 Oh, I already said it was Dark Souls.
00:38:35 Oh, yeah, right.
00:38:36 But it's funny because Dark Souls,
00:38:38 my reason is opposite of Gibbons
00:38:40 because, or Hippos, rather,
00:38:42 because Hippo said that
00:38:44 Dark Souls is a game he feels he can always...
00:38:46 I'm back. I'm back. I'm back.
00:38:48 Okay, good.
00:38:49 I didn't even know you were gone.
00:38:50 Yeah, no one knew.
00:38:51 Alright.
00:38:54 God damn it.
00:38:55 Hippo was saying how Dark Souls is a game
00:38:57 he can pick up and play anytime.
00:38:59 He can play it over and over again
00:39:00 and keep playing it.
00:39:01 I actually don't really like playing Dark Souls.
00:39:04 You still haven't beaten it, right?
00:39:06 Yeah, I've never beaten it.
00:39:08 I've played up through Ornstein and Smo.
00:39:12 But I like it more because
00:39:15 I like watching it and I like thinking about it,
00:39:18 and I find it so...
00:39:20 Which is so you. It's so you.
00:39:22 I find it so naturally pleasing
00:39:25 because I love the way the controls are,
00:39:28 the way that the game feels,
00:39:30 that it's a game about running up to an enemy
00:39:33 and timing your attacks right
00:39:35 and dodging, and that even though it's an RPG,
00:39:38 it completely plays like an action game.
00:39:41 It's sort of the best of both worlds.
00:39:44 I love that every environment is so different,
00:39:48 and yet it all feels right together.
00:39:51 Dark Souls is a game where there's a lava level
00:39:56 and there's an ice cave type place.
00:40:00 There's this and that.
00:40:01 Highly original level designs.
00:40:03 Right. They're all these different stuff
00:40:05 that you usually see in games,
00:40:07 but they all flow together so logically
00:40:10 that you don't really question it that much,
00:40:13 even though it would be weird
00:40:15 for some of those things to exist in the same place.
00:40:17 It doesn't even make sense, like,
00:40:19 Ash Lake where is that, but it's not important.
00:40:21 But that's what's even cool.
00:40:22 Ash Lake is my favorite.
00:40:23 Yeah, it's the best.
00:40:24 Ash Lake for me is like...
00:40:26 I've always said it's like the keystone
00:40:28 for what I appreciate about Dark Souls,
00:40:30 which is that...
00:40:31 And the fact that it's hidden behind two invisible walls.
00:40:33 Yeah, the fact that you would never see it
00:40:35 unless you were really into it.
00:40:37 Either you heard about it from someone
00:40:39 or you were just exploring this game
00:40:41 down to the fucking teeth.
00:40:43 And it's this magical, ethereal, strange world
00:40:47 that seems to be underneath the world.
00:40:50 It's a lake that's underneath the entire world somehow.
00:40:55 And you go down there and there's two fucking hydras,
00:40:58 and then this ancient dragon king who doesn't say anything
00:41:01 and he just gives you a dragon head
00:41:03 and now you can breathe fire.
00:41:05 It's insanity.
00:41:08 But that's the most magical feeling place in the game.
00:41:14 Totally.
00:41:15 I don't think...
00:41:16 For me, the coolest things about games,
00:41:19 these are the things I value the absolute most,
00:41:22 are the cathartic feeling of movement.
00:41:26 Just feeling good controlling your character
00:41:29 and having a world that I'm interested in.
00:41:35 Pretty much world building and catharsis.
00:41:37 Those are the two biggest things.
00:41:39 So I'm a huge fan of Ocarina of Time.
00:41:41 It's actually my second favorite game
00:41:43 because in comparison to all of the other Zelda games,
00:41:47 I feel like this is something that no one talks about enough
00:41:50 when they talk about Zelda.
00:41:52 They all have totally different controls.
00:41:55 Even though they're all the same basic controls,
00:41:58 the way Link moves changes a lot.
00:42:02 If you play, say, Twilight Princess or the Wind Waker,
00:42:06 Link kind of controls a motorcycle where you hold forward
00:42:11 and you steer him left and right
00:42:14 and he moves in a weird circular fashion.
00:42:17 Whereas in Ocarina of Time, he moves more like a 2D character.
00:42:21 He moves exactly as much as you press the control stick.
00:42:24 When you let go, he stops.
00:42:26 When you touch to the side, he turns to the side.
00:42:29 You just have a more direct control.
00:42:33 I could see thinking it feels a little stiff, maybe,
00:42:37 but I don't know.
00:42:39 I always feel like every step has weight to it.
00:42:42 Everything Link does in that game has a certain weight to it.
00:42:46 The way controlling him feels is so good
00:42:49 that there was a point when I was playing that game
00:42:52 and I was taking song requests
00:42:55 and people were telling me songs to sing.
00:42:57 I was doing side flips and back flips
00:43:00 in Kakariko Village for 45 minutes.
00:43:03 I was doing back flips and side flips.
00:43:05 Was it a good time?
00:43:06 Yeah, it was great.
00:43:07 You can just flip off of everything.
00:43:10 You can start flipping off of ledges
00:43:12 and watching how he reacts to different elevation changes
00:43:17 and stuff.
00:43:18 It feels so good to watch him flip around in that game.
00:43:22 The Wind Waker has almost the same feel,
00:43:30 but the Wind Waker is also...
00:43:32 You have to get in a boat.
00:43:34 You're on this little island and you can roll around a little bit,
00:43:37 but then you get in a boat and you sail somewhere.
00:43:39 Being in the boat is cool as an idea,
00:43:42 but it doesn't feel as good.
00:43:44 In Ocarina of Time,
00:43:45 I could just literally side flip across the whole world
00:43:48 if I wanted to.
00:43:49 That's what all the speedruns are,
00:43:51 because side flipping is the fastest way to travel.
00:43:53 If you watch a speedrun,
00:43:54 they'll just side flip through the whole fucking game.
00:43:56 It looks crazy.
00:43:58 The world is very dense and intricate,
00:44:02 and everyone in it has their own story
00:44:05 that they're living out that has nothing to do with you
00:44:08 unless you make yourself a part of it,
00:44:11 which is a great thing about Dark Souls.
00:44:13 All the NPCs have their own game they're playing.
00:44:17 Each of them is the main character of their own story,
00:44:20 and each of them is basically, if you failed,
00:44:23 this is what you would become.
00:44:25 They're all other heroes from other timelines.
00:44:28 As Sunbro points out,
00:44:31 time is fucked up in Lordran,
00:44:33 and everyone here is from their own game,
00:44:35 but they all fuck up.
00:44:37 They all die, except Sunbro,
00:44:39 if you keep him alive through the whole game.
00:44:43 I like that.
00:44:45 I like it when the world sort of exists without you,
00:44:48 and Undertale does a pretty good job of that,
00:44:50 where it has the characters show up in the bar,
00:44:52 and they continue to have their own dialogue together
00:44:55 and their own things that they're up to,
00:44:57 even though the game is so short
00:44:59 that they can't really get up to a lot.
00:45:02 You don't see a lot of things going on in the world,
00:45:05 but it's nice that they have those things.
00:45:08 In that sense,
00:45:10 I definitely think that
00:45:12 all the characters of the game exist
00:45:14 to make you like them.
00:45:16 Like you said, it might not have been as much time as would be ideal,
00:45:18 but their function...
00:45:20 Are you back to talking about Undertale now?
00:45:22 Briefly, yes.
00:45:24 It's just that the characters, to me,
00:45:26 I like them all,
00:45:28 but they really are simply a tool
00:45:30 to attach you to the world
00:45:32 to put you through the exercise
00:45:36 of playing Undertale
00:45:38 and making the decisions
00:45:40 that you make when you play that game
00:45:42 based on those feelings,
00:45:44 and it really is most effective
00:45:46 if you really care about the characters.
00:45:48 And for me, I was totally on board.
00:45:50 I like every single character there a ton,
00:45:52 except for Alphas, who's kind of an asshole,
00:45:54 but she's okay.
00:45:56 But you know what? I want to talk for a second,
00:45:58 just to finish up what you were saying before.
00:46:00 The way you were describing all those things
00:46:02 and the way each of us have talked about
00:46:04 our favorite games,
00:46:06 I really think shows the kind of person we are
00:46:08 and as a result, why we like
00:46:10 the kind of games we like.
00:46:12 You're describing all these...
00:46:14 your appreciation for the construction of the world
00:46:16 and the way it all feels,
00:46:18 even though you don't really play
00:46:20 a ton of games, like Dark Souls, if you've never played it,
00:46:22 it's your favorite game,
00:46:24 but you like to step back and appreciate it
00:46:26 as a big piece of art altogether.
00:46:28 And then Ben, like Binding of Isaac,
00:46:30 is his favorite game,
00:46:32 and Ben likes to just sit down for hours
00:46:34 and just play a game and just get into it,
00:46:36 like master it.
00:46:38 He played...
00:46:40 Orbezatben, you played that?
00:46:42 Oh, a fucking Dungeon Crawlstone soup.
00:46:44 Yeah, yeah.
00:46:46 It took me a year and a half to beat it.
00:46:48 Congratulations.
00:46:50 And then Gib, I don't know,
00:46:52 Gib seems like he's looking for light-hearted,
00:46:54 fun most of the time when he's playing games.
00:46:56 He plays fucking Dark Souls.
00:46:58 It was his favorite game.
00:47:00 To kind of goof around.
00:47:02 Is that wrong?
00:47:04 I don't think that is right.
00:47:06 I think he's doing the same thing I'm doing
00:47:08 and just getting immersed in a day-old game.
00:47:10 You don't talk about it that much.
00:47:12 Yeah, there you go.
00:47:14 I want to kill things in Dark Souls.
00:47:16 And then there's me,
00:47:18 who, more than anything,
00:47:20 likes to play games where
00:47:22 a hero goes on a journey and achieves self-actualization,
00:47:24 clearly a projection
00:47:26 of my deep personal insecurities
00:47:28 and a desire to fulfill them.
00:47:30 You know, all of these things
00:47:32 are what make each of our favorite games
00:47:34 and it's completely a projection
00:47:36 of our values
00:47:38 and the kind of person we are.
00:47:40 I would feel a little guilty
00:47:42 picking Binding of Isaac as a game of all time
00:47:44 because it's so deficient
00:47:46 in the story category.
00:47:48 And I do like game stories,
00:47:50 but I don't, yeah,
00:47:52 I guess I just don't feel like there
00:47:54 what I really play games for.
00:47:56 Because I, like,
00:47:58 with Dark Souls, I can kind of
00:48:00 rest assured that I do think
00:48:02 it's a cool story,
00:48:04 but I don't really value
00:48:06 the actual narrative that much.
00:48:08 I like that it's so,
00:48:10 that there's so much going on
00:48:12 and that it sort of feels like it exists without me,
00:48:14 but the actual specifics
00:48:16 of who the characters are
00:48:18 and what they mean,
00:48:20 the lore has never really grabbed me that much.
00:48:22 And because of that, it's fun.
00:48:24 There's no way that you'd love
00:48:26 a game like Undertale as much as someone like me.
00:48:28 Just because our priorities are so different
00:48:30 in that sense.
00:48:32 Or like Jesse, I guess.
00:48:34 My little brother Shade, who's a big fan of both Dark Souls
00:48:36 and Undertale, he gets deep into
00:48:38 lore and deep into knowing
00:48:40 the background info.
00:48:42 I like the lore a lot in Dark Souls, that's probably my favorite thing.
00:48:44 He really only started getting into
00:48:46 Undertale once he started
00:48:48 learning all the crazy
00:48:50 background stuff.
00:48:52 Did he get into it after playing it or to
00:48:54 start to play?
00:48:56 He played through it.
00:48:58 He did the pacifist run, he was doing the genocide run.
00:49:00 But then he just started coming up to me
00:49:02 every day with all these new facts
00:49:04 he'd learned about the game.
00:49:06 And telling me all this stuff that he'd heard.
00:49:08 Because I didn't watch anything
00:49:10 of the game after beating it.
00:49:12 I just kind of played through and was done.
00:49:14 But then I kept hearing new things about it from other people.
00:49:16 And all of it is very cool
00:49:18 to know that it's all there.
00:49:20 That kind of stuff doesn't make me
00:49:22 love the game more.
00:49:24 I'm just like, oh, that's really neat.
00:49:26 It's cool that it's there.
00:49:28 It itself is not like anything mind-blowing.
00:49:30 The only thing about the Dark Souls
00:49:32 story that I think really stands out to me
00:49:34 is great is the whole fire metaphor.
00:49:36 And everything
00:49:38 that they try to do with that.
00:49:40 Yeah, that was very effective.
00:49:42 Like, Ocarina of Time, I could not give a
00:49:44 single fuck about the narrative of that game.
00:49:46 Even though when I was a kid it was the
00:49:48 greatest narrative I'd ever seen before
00:49:50 in my life.
00:49:52 When I was a kid, growing up...
00:49:54 You don't think that now just have not explored?
00:49:56 Growing up, Ocarina of Time was my
00:49:58 favorite game purely from having
00:50:00 watched my cousin play it and having never
00:50:02 seen a game with a story before.
00:50:04 And I literally never
00:50:06 heard of a game having a story.
00:50:08 What, like 1998?
00:50:10 It was probably 99 or 2000
00:50:12 when I watched him play through it.
00:50:14 You got to play more Final Fantasy past Digi.
00:50:16 My dad was an N64. I'd never
00:50:18 seen any other console.
00:50:20 Uh, Conker's Bad Fur Day. Greatest story ever told.
00:50:22 Yeah, and I found out about that one later
00:50:24 and I always wanted to know the story
00:50:26 because the story seemed really interesting.
00:50:28 I'm making that up. I've never even played it.
00:50:30 Oh, it's got a phenomenal...
00:50:32 I don't know about the story, but the
00:50:34 dialogue and the voice acting
00:50:36 is fucking incredible in that game.
00:50:38 Unfortunately, I don't like playing the game at all.
00:50:40 I think it's boring and shitty, but
00:50:42 the dialogue is great.
00:50:44 Like Banjo?
00:50:46 Is it a collectathon like Banjo?
00:50:48 It is exactly like Banjo because
00:50:50 it's not, though, because Banjo-Kazooie
00:50:52 is more of a platformer
00:50:54 that's more skill-based.
00:50:56 It has platforming challenges.
00:50:58 Conker feels, to me,
00:51:00 more like an adventure game.
00:51:02 It's sort of like Psychonauts
00:51:04 where every level is just something
00:51:06 different and I think that's the biggest
00:51:08 problem, is that it constantly...
00:51:10 every single place you go has a new mechanic
00:51:12 for you to learn, but none of them are like
00:51:14 fun, you know?
00:51:16 Oh, and speaking of best game ever, Psychonauts
00:51:18 too, guys, go give your money to Tim Schaefer,
00:51:20 the whole fucking hack himself,
00:51:22 3 million, and it'll make Psychonauts
00:51:24 too. Fuck you, Tim Schaefer.
00:51:26 I think Psychonauts is super overrated.
00:51:28 It's like that weird underrated, overrated sort of game.
00:51:30 Well, the story and story loves it so much.
00:51:32 But the actually playing
00:51:34 the game is just frustrating as fuck,
00:51:36 especially the last level is the worst thing
00:51:38 I've ever played before.
00:51:40 And remember that time in that game where you're
00:51:42 like talking with the girl and you're like,
00:51:44 oh, we gotta come up with a plan. And she's like,
00:51:46 yeah, we gotta do something. Oh, we gotta go save everyone.
00:51:48 We should make out.
00:51:50 That was probably the funniest thing
00:51:52 in any game I've ever played.
00:51:54 My favorite part is when you find the two
00:51:56 like quiet kids sitting up on the roof.
00:51:58 Do you know what I'm talking about?
00:52:00 It's not in the story. It's not a cutscene.
00:52:02 It's just at some point you're walking around.
00:52:04 You can go up on a roof and like the two
00:52:06 like nice, quiet, like I think maybe
00:52:08 they're implied to be religious kids.
00:52:10 The boy and the girl, they're sitting up there.
00:52:12 And if you listen to them, they're just like,
00:52:14 look at all the people down there.
00:52:16 They look like tiny little ants.
00:52:18 And the other one's like, they are ants.
00:52:20 Worthless little ants.
00:52:22 And if you hit them,
00:52:24 they like respond to it,
00:52:26 but in a real like, they try to be nice
00:52:28 about it. You can tell they're really hurt
00:52:30 emotionally.
00:52:32 By the way, like you use this way,
00:52:34 you do a psychic punch on them and one of them's like,
00:52:36 hey, look who's still punching.
00:52:38 And then your character's like,
00:52:40 and your character's like, oh God,
00:52:42 what have I done?
00:52:44 You know, I told that kissing story once
00:52:46 when me and my friends were in line for lunch
00:52:48 in college somewhere.
00:52:50 And like as I got to the end and just yelled at like,
00:52:52 we should make out this guy behind me in line.
00:52:54 You're just like, dude, you do that too?
00:52:56 Like, yeah, I just,
00:52:58 if you go up to, if you're in a party
00:53:00 and you go up to enough girls and you say that,
00:53:02 what I was gonna make out with you?
00:53:04 Yeah, that guy was alpha as fuck.
00:53:06 My role model.
00:53:08 It led you to some important life lessons.
00:53:10 Some important game.
00:53:12 Anyways, you know, there's
00:53:14 there's only ever for me been one
00:53:16 game that like I legitimately
00:53:18 care about the story and that's
00:53:20 the Mass Effect.
00:53:22 Mass Effect 1 and 2.
00:53:24 Is that just because it did so much
00:53:26 to give the characters and make them
00:53:28 like fleshed out people? Yeah, it's the only game
00:53:30 I've played where like, I just
00:53:32 honest to God found it
00:53:34 really interesting.
00:53:36 Like the characters in the world
00:53:38 are so fleshed out
00:53:40 and just like
00:53:42 it's a game that
00:53:44 has like any
00:53:46 story I could name that like
00:53:48 like any like HBO drama or anything
00:53:50 like that that's considered to be like a great
00:53:52 narrative or something.
00:53:54 It's as good as that.
00:53:56 Like the story is legitimately as good
00:53:58 as any story I've ever heard before.
00:54:00 Yeah, Commander Shepherd, I'm
00:54:02 the Asari lady. Nice to meet you.
00:54:04 I'm super attracted to you.
00:54:06 I love you more than anyone I've ever known
00:54:08 in my entire life. You've completely
00:54:10 opened me up and let's
00:54:12 immediately have sex right now.
00:54:14 10 out of 10 writing, dude. Sounds like a
00:54:16 10 out of 10 writing. I will say
00:54:18 that not
00:54:20 not everything in Mass Effect is
00:54:22 equally interesting.
00:54:24 My favorite in the trilogy is the second
00:54:26 game and there are some of the characters
00:54:28 you meet like late into the game
00:54:30 are just kind of whatever who cares.
00:54:32 Yeah. But like
00:54:34 you know, I think Garrus is a
00:54:36 fantastic character. His whole arc is great.
00:54:38 Tali's pretty
00:54:40 is a really fun character. I have a deep affection
00:54:42 for the quarry and papal.
00:54:44 Rex is great, you know, throughout
00:54:46 all the games and like the entire
00:54:48 everything that has to do
00:54:50 with the Genophage
00:54:52 and the fucking
00:54:54 what are they called?
00:54:56 Not a sorry.
00:54:58 The other guys. Rex's race.
00:55:00 The Krogans. Everything that has to do with
00:55:02 the Krogans and the Genophage
00:55:04 and Mordyn Solis is like
00:55:06 the most interesting shit ever.
00:55:08 Mordyn especially is my favorite character
00:55:10 in like any game because
00:55:12 he's in the second game. You'll meet him
00:55:14 pretty early on and he's a doctor
00:55:16 who he literally
00:55:18 created the Genophage and committed the
00:55:20 genocide of killing all of the Krogans
00:55:22 and he joins your team
00:55:24 and that's going to cause some
00:55:26 tension. The thing about it is though
00:55:28 that he did it because
00:55:30 he was trying to save the galaxy.
00:55:32 Just like when we nuked Hiroshima
00:55:34 and Nagasaki. To him it was like
00:55:36 deciding to choose
00:55:38 the needs of the many over the needs of the few
00:55:40 but then the long term consequences
00:55:42 of it make it questionable
00:55:44 whether it really was better
00:55:46 or worse.
00:55:48 He sort of has to grapple with
00:55:50 deciding whether or not he
00:55:52 still feels that way and then has
00:55:54 a fantastic payoff in the third game.
00:55:56 It's by far the best thing about the third game
00:55:58 is the end of Mordyn and
00:56:00 the Krogans story.
00:56:02 I've heard.
00:56:04 It's just legit fascinating and the game
00:56:06 just has so much information about everything
00:56:08 because not only
00:56:10 do you go to planets and you can like read
00:56:12 little, you'll find text logs in places
00:56:14 and learn little details here and there
00:56:16 but then the game has like
00:56:18 an insanely huge codec
00:56:20 that you can read through and it's like
00:56:22 a lot of it's voiced so you'll have like
00:56:24 a narrator telling you like audio books
00:56:26 about the world.
00:56:28 Another game that has a massive
00:56:30 log like that
00:56:32 is Final Fantasy 13
00:56:34 and all the seasons.
00:56:36 Why is it that it's so much more enjoyable
00:56:38 to read through the codecs of Mass Effect
00:56:40 than Final Fantasy 13?
00:56:42 Probably because the...
00:56:44 I haven't played 13 but I am playing
00:56:46 Lightning Returns and I have been
00:56:48 reading all the codecs in that
00:56:50 and having a great time with it.
00:56:52 Well that blows me away that you actually read through them all
00:56:54 because man I hated reading them
00:56:56 that Lightning Returns
00:56:58 is batshit insane.
00:57:00 Like the story is the craziest
00:57:02 thing that I've ever heard of
00:57:04 because it takes place in a world
00:57:06 where everyone has become immortal
00:57:08 and no one new has been born in
00:57:10 500 years and everyone who is still alive
00:57:12 has been alive for 500 years
00:57:14 and Lightning has become...
00:57:16 great. That sounds like a fucking
00:57:18 crazy fantasy world to me.
00:57:20 I would love to live in that world.
00:57:22 It's fucking insane and Lightning is now
00:57:24 like an angel working for God
00:57:26 trying to save everyone's souls
00:57:28 because the rapture is about to happen
00:57:30 and reset the world.
00:57:32 I wish that was an original game and did not
00:57:34 involve Lightning.
00:57:36 Did you the way you're describing
00:57:38 Final Fantasy 13.2 Lightning Returns to me
00:57:40 sounds awesome.
00:57:42 It's the third one, not the second one.
00:57:44 The thing is, the thing about Lightning Returns
00:57:46 I mean the characters themselves
00:57:48 are like planks of wood.
00:57:50 Like they're not
00:57:52 interesting characters but the world
00:57:54 is just so insane
00:57:56 that I'm like fascinated
00:57:58 with it and I keep learning new things
00:58:00 and there's like there's so many like gods
00:58:02 and random bits of
00:58:04 like lore that
00:58:06 have nothing to do with anything and I'm like
00:58:08 what the fuck is this like I'm not
00:58:10 necessarily saying that it's like a great story
00:58:12 but it's just fascinating that a game
00:58:14 is like this and to me it's sort of
00:58:16 like how every RPG kind of
00:58:18 ends with you like killing God
00:58:20 and it feels like this game is what happens
00:58:22 like if you had already killed God
00:58:24 and then the world got really weird afterwards.
00:58:26 Kind of like the end of God of War 3
00:58:28 I guess. Yeah a little bit.
00:58:30 I always thought that was interesting and they just don't describe
00:58:32 like the world is fucked but
00:58:34 they just that's the end. Yeah he just kind of ruins
00:58:36 everything and like yeah and
00:58:38 you know most of these RPGs
00:58:40 they don't really usually have much
00:58:42 of a day-new-mon. They don't really show you
00:58:44 what happened after you
00:58:46 changed the entire nature
00:58:48 of reality and like this
00:58:50 kind of... You just get
00:58:52 all your party members, stand them on the bow
00:58:54 of their airship and have them all look up
00:58:56 at the sky as like the
00:58:58 rubble of their past world
00:59:00 and then have the main character jump off and disappear
00:59:02 and not be heard of again. Well nobody cares
00:59:04 about like how
00:59:06 lock, marry cellies
00:59:08 and settles down to like become
00:59:10 you know and it started venturing
00:59:12 like mercenary business. Nobody
00:59:14 gives a shit. We just know that they won
00:59:16 and then they can just do whatever. You can just fill it in.
00:59:18 It's really hilarious because
00:59:20 on the one hand I feel like
00:59:22 the reason they can get away with
00:59:24 doing this story in Lightning Returns
00:59:26 is that it's a sequel to a popular
00:59:28 game so people will buy it.
00:59:30 But I think it's
00:59:32 a terrible sequel because
00:59:34 it takes place 500 years later and everyone's
00:59:36 totally different now because they've aged
00:59:38 500 years. Not to mention
00:59:40 the fact that 13.2 ends on a huge
00:59:42 cliffhanger and to wait
00:59:44 like 500 years is just the worst
00:59:46 fucking thing you could possibly do.
00:59:48 I'm still mad. If it wasn't
00:59:50 like 50 hours long
00:59:52 I'd be tempted to play
00:59:54 Final Fantasy 13 and the sequels
00:59:56 just to see because sometimes
00:59:58 I end up liking things that nobody else like
01:00:00 and I would be curious if I could find anything
01:00:02 to love about it. Here's the thing, Lightning Returns
01:00:04 is a lot more well-liked
01:00:06 by critics in the first two.
01:00:08 I don't know about if fans like it
01:00:10 but critics in general were like
01:00:12 this game is actually kind of fun to play
01:00:14 and it's... I'm not
01:00:16 far into it but it seems
01:00:18 like it's very short
01:00:20 but it also seems like you can
01:00:22 fuck up so badly so early on
01:00:24 that you will need to play it twice. This is a game
01:00:26 you can fail. It takes place
01:00:28 over the course of 13 days
01:00:30 and you basically have to
01:00:32 save enough souls by the end of 13 days
01:00:34 by doing like... you have to get through
01:00:36 all the main missions and then you can do a certain
01:00:38 number of side missions if you want to get like a perfect
01:00:40 run but if you
01:00:42 fuck up and you don't do the missions in time
01:00:44 then you just lose and you get a game over
01:00:46 but you're allowed to do like
01:00:48 a new game plus and like even if you
01:00:50 fail and sort of keep all your weapons
01:00:52 so I don't feel too bad about the idea
01:00:54 that I'm probably gonna fail because I fucked up
01:00:56 so bad on day one that I feel like
01:00:58 I'm already set back forever
01:01:00 and it's a little bit confusing because the game
01:01:02 like as if
01:01:04 in response to the previous games is like
01:01:06 totally open like you just go
01:01:08 wherever you want and do whatever you want
01:01:10 to an extent and so
01:01:12 like I got lost. This is obviously a reaction
01:01:14 to the whole...
01:01:16 I kind of got lost trying to find my way around
01:01:18 and like figure out where everything is
01:01:20 and I felt like oh shit I don't really like
01:01:22 I actually I kind of don't like the
01:01:24 mechanic of the time thing because I feel like I really
01:01:26 wanted to get engrossed in this world
01:01:28 and instead I'm running around like crazy
01:01:30 you know it's a
01:01:32 it's a lot like Dead Rising where you
01:01:34 it's so strict about
01:01:36 being on time that you
01:01:38 like it's almost at odds with what you actually want
01:01:40 to do in Dead Rising which is to just go
01:01:42 fucking kill zombies with weird
01:01:44 you know weapons and shit. Yeah I've heard
01:01:46 mixed things about the Dead Rising
01:01:48 I think Dead Rising is a
01:01:50 fantastic game after watching them play it
01:01:52 on Game Grumps and being reminded of it
01:01:54 I think it's fucking awesome.
01:01:56 If I if I might bring this conversation
01:01:58 back to the topic of the best
01:02:00 sure sure let let me
01:02:02 I'll just I'll just start a whole new thing
01:02:04 Okay. My pet peeve
01:02:06 is people who think
01:02:08 that a best game
01:02:10 and a favorite game should be two
01:02:12 different things. Those people deserve to be firebombed.
01:02:14 I think they should all be consigned to the flames.
01:02:16 I think they can be two different things.
01:02:18 No you're different
01:02:20 from your own face are you recording Jesse?
01:02:22 I am recording.
01:02:24 What the fuck? Jesse's here?
01:02:26 I showed up. Okay.
01:02:28 The count of three say Misty. One, two, three
01:02:30 Misty. Misty. Misty.
01:02:32 Okay good.
01:02:34 No okay Jesse defend your position.
01:02:36 Why is it okay to separate them?
01:02:38 Well okay.
01:02:40 I wouldn't call Crazy Taxi the best game ever made.
01:02:42 Well that's just objectively wrong.
01:02:44 Okay. But I would totally call it my favorite
01:02:46 game ever made.
01:02:48 Why isn't it the best? Isn't the game's function
01:02:50 to give you enjoyment? Wait I have a question Jesse.
01:02:52 Yeah. Would you say it's exclusively
01:02:54 your favorite game?
01:02:56 No. I have like five
01:02:58 favorite games ever made.
01:03:00 Is one of those your also your pick for their
01:03:02 best game?
01:03:04 I guess. I don't fucking know.
01:03:06 Is it Lion King? Yes.
01:03:08 Lion King for Sega Genesis
01:03:10 is the best game ever made
01:03:12 objectively. No.
01:03:14 And that's the end of the conversation.
01:03:16 The monkeys cost at all
01:03:18 of its points.
01:03:20 But it's got the hippos.
01:03:22 Right? Hippocrates.
01:03:24 It's your favorite game.
01:03:26 I'm with you Ben.
01:03:28 I hate when people try to like
01:03:30 to make...
01:03:32 I hate any best game ever list
01:03:34 that goes by impact
01:03:36 and then has like games that aren't even
01:03:38 good anymore on the list.
01:03:40 Like oh this year
01:03:42 I played
01:03:44 down well for five hundred hours
01:03:46 and fucking loved every second of it.
01:03:48 On the other hand
01:03:50 I thought Undertale was a pretentious piece of shit
01:03:52 but you know everyone likes Undertale
01:03:54 and it made such a good thing
01:03:56 for the indie scene that I'm going to name it
01:03:58 the best game of the year. Fuck that.
01:04:00 I'm glad you guys are talking about this now
01:04:02 because I sort of mentioned before
01:04:04 I'm going to sound like a hypocrite now
01:04:06 but I really do take
01:04:08 impact on the world
01:04:10 into my examination
01:04:12 of what I think is the best game ever.
01:04:14 Well that's wrong. That's wrong of you.
01:04:16 What I value in a game is
01:04:18 the influence it's going to have
01:04:20 not only on just me but on everyone.
01:04:22 Bullshit. Like I really love Undertale
01:04:24 but I think that it has
01:04:26 more implications. I like Undertale
01:04:28 because I see it. That doesn't make it a better game.
01:04:30 Undertale is a quiz
01:04:32 that I want everyone to take to learn about themselves.
01:04:34 That doesn't make the game any better than it is.
01:04:36 It does. What?
01:04:38 Do you think that Undertale is
01:04:40 the best game ever
01:04:42 because of its impact
01:04:44 or because of your value
01:04:46 of its impact?
01:04:48 Definitely because of my value.
01:04:50 If you didn't give a fuck about Undertale
01:04:52 but it had a huge amount of impact
01:04:54 would you still call it the best game ever?
01:04:56 Definitely not. I would certainly say that.
01:04:58 So it is ultimately
01:05:00 just you saying that it's the game you like the most
01:05:02 and therefore it's the favorite.
01:05:04 The reason it's the game you like the most
01:05:06 is because it has impact.
01:05:08 I guess that just happens to be my
01:05:10 what I value.
01:05:12 What I've been talking a lot is that I feel
01:05:14 so weakly about this whole subject.
01:05:16 I just don't care.
01:05:18 Get out of my podcast!
01:05:20 It is kind of totally stupid and pointless.
01:05:22 Well, we're fair enough.
01:05:24 Okay, yes.
01:05:26 Games are fun. I like them.
01:05:28 I agree.
01:05:30 I said Binding of Isaac before.
01:05:32 I'm not super committed to that choice.
01:05:34 I really wouldn't say that I have a strong pick
01:05:36 for a best game ever.
01:05:38 Hey guys, go make a Procrastinator's Wiki
01:05:40 because this is Binding of Isaac.
01:05:42 It's official.
01:05:44 Whatever.
01:05:46 If I'm picking one,
01:05:48 I honestly don't see how you can defend
01:05:50 any other position than mine
01:05:52 because there's no objective standard
01:05:54 for how good something is.
01:05:56 Therefore, the only metric
01:05:58 of how good it is is how much you like it.
01:06:00 Therefore, your favorite and the best
01:06:02 should be synonymous.
01:06:04 I agree.
01:06:06 I think that the best game of 2015
01:06:08 was Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax.
01:06:10 Fine.
01:06:12 Is Mage here?
01:06:14 Yes, Mage is in the call.
01:06:16 Are you recording? Are you recording your audio?
01:06:18 Mage, we can barely hear you.
01:06:20 Wait, you are recording your audio, right?
01:06:22 Well, you gotta record your audio.
01:06:24 It's gonna be all fucked up.
01:06:26 Don't speak until you're recording your audio.
01:06:30 It sounds like you're talking into a headset
01:06:32 that's on the opposite end of the room.
01:06:34 Guys, it's gonna be blank sounds.
01:06:36 Somebody say something.
01:06:38 What's...
01:06:40 Well, I don't know what the hippo was trying to say earlier.
01:06:42 Oh, yeah, yeah.
01:06:44 What do you say something?
01:06:46 Was I...
01:06:48 You got mad at me for cutting you off.
01:06:50 Oh, yeah, that's true.
01:06:52 Oh, I forgot.
01:06:54 Okay.
01:06:56 You're recording, right?
01:06:58 You're recording?
01:07:00 Ah, you got it. You're recording right now.
01:07:02 You're recording? Okay, let's sync up.
01:07:04 Okay. On the count of three, say,
01:07:06 Misty's my favorite Pokemon trainer.
01:07:08 I like red, blue, the best is the best game.
01:07:10 Okay, ready? One, two, three.
01:07:12 Misty's my favorite Pokemon trainer.
01:07:14 Fuck you, man, you piece of shit.
01:07:16 Okay, go on, Gib.
01:07:18 Hippo.
01:07:20 I have no idea.
01:07:22 What I'm doing here...
01:07:24 Mage, what is your opinion on the best game ever?
01:07:26 Yeah, what's your favorite game?
01:07:28 Undertale?
01:07:30 Yeah, yeah, what do you think is the best game ever?
01:07:32 And is it the same as your favorite game?
01:07:34 Yeah, yeah.
01:07:36 I mean, I don't
01:07:38 particularly believe in the best game ever,
01:07:40 what I'm calling, but
01:07:42 my favorite game is definitely Undertale.
01:07:44 And I...
01:07:46 Really? Yes.
01:07:48 Shock. Would you say of all time?
01:07:50 Fair enough. Yeah, of all time.
01:07:52 Of all time, would you say?
01:07:54 At this moment in time, yes.
01:07:56 Okay, okay.
01:07:58 I think I have one favorite game of all time,
01:08:00 because it's going to change.
01:08:02 Yeah, but you know, all of these
01:08:04 questions are in the context of the time.
01:08:06 The phrase of all time is a weird
01:08:08 phrase, because it's
01:08:10 never of all time.
01:08:12 That's the thing.
01:08:14 I mean, it means up to now.
01:08:16 It means right now.
01:08:18 That's the phrase we should adopt.
01:08:20 Instead of saying my favorite of all time,
01:08:22 we should be saying my favorite now, currently.
01:08:24 That doesn't sound as impressive.
01:08:26 That's the whole point.
01:08:28 Because I feel like of all time...
01:08:30 Well, I feel like of all time implies
01:08:32 and I think this is how people think
01:08:34 of it and this is why people sometimes
01:08:36 vote for those older games that they don't care about anymore
01:08:38 is that they think of it in terms of
01:08:40 what game they liked the longest.
01:08:42 Which is a perfectly valid way
01:08:44 to like a game. To be honest,
01:08:46 that's why I'm picking Isaac. I haven't played
01:08:48 the new Isaac, but I loved
01:08:50 it so much and I played it for so long
01:08:52 and I still think it's a great
01:08:54 and amazing game.
01:08:56 Like right now I care way more about
01:08:58 Undertale than about Binding of Isaac
01:09:00 and yet I'm not comfortable picking Undertale
01:09:02 just because it's so new.
01:09:04 I'm glad you brought this up. I wanted to talk about this too.
01:09:06 And it seems like...
01:09:08 I think this shows kind of maybe
01:09:10 the context of the gaming industry
01:09:12 or maybe just us as consumers of it
01:09:14 with like YouTube and Let's Plays and all the stuff now.
01:09:16 So like the previous winners of the poll
01:09:18 were Final Fantasy 7 and Ocarina of Time,
01:09:20 which are really old games that have
01:09:22 their like legends.
01:09:24 I was here talking about the game path, I think.
01:09:26 Yeah, the concept of a best game ever and what it means.
01:09:28 So those games won.
01:09:30 That's kind of what inspired the discussion.
01:09:32 Those games won kind of based on their
01:09:34 legacy status
01:09:36 and I think that maybe it had something to do
01:09:38 with the way that games were coming out
01:09:40 and the way people appreciate games.
01:09:42 But these days, like what are the most
01:09:44 popular games in the world? Like League of Legends?
01:09:46 Stuff that's like
01:09:48 quickly consumable
01:09:50 and can be like
01:09:52 completed rapidly
01:09:54 and is like mass consumable.
01:09:56 And I wonder if it
01:09:58 doesn't say that as a culture of people
01:10:00 playing games, we have more
01:10:02 interest in something like Undertale
01:10:04 that's super new and might
01:10:06 not even last very long.
01:10:08 But our focus is
01:10:10 attuned to these sort of
01:10:12 you know like spurts of popularity
01:10:14 less so than it is to the big
01:10:16 context of all the games we've
01:10:18 ever played. Our focus is shifting
01:10:20 I'm wondering.
01:10:22 It's an interesting point.
01:10:26 I think
01:10:28 a big part, now that you've made me think
01:10:30 about it, I think a big part of the reason
01:10:32 that we're going to see a shift away from
01:10:34 Zelda and Final Fantasy winning everything
01:10:36 forever is that
01:10:38 right now
01:10:40 it's happening and in five years
01:10:42 it will be the case that
01:10:44 gamers are not mostly
01:10:46 in their late 20s anymore.
01:10:48 That's true. Because the thing is
01:10:50 there's a very clear bias
01:10:52 towards the year 1997
01:10:54 here.
01:10:56 A time
01:10:58 period when
01:11:00 the majority of
01:11:02 I've seen enough GameFAQs polls to
01:11:04 know the general age of
01:11:06 the site because they'll ask you how old you are
01:11:08 and things like that. Right, around our age
01:11:10 it's like the median
01:11:12 age of the website.
01:11:14 And it's a lot of people
01:11:16 who are in their late 20s
01:11:18 who played these games and they were young
01:11:20 and the reason that I know that has to be the case
01:11:22 because on the one hand I do think
01:11:24 that Ocarina of Time and Final Fantasy 7
01:11:26 hold up extremely well
01:11:28 and that both of them are games that can compete
01:11:30 with all the modern games right now
01:11:32 and the sort of
01:11:34 oldest games that still
01:11:36 get to the top of the list are
01:11:38 Super Nintendo games.
01:11:40 Super Metroid
01:11:42 and Chrono Trigger
01:11:44 and Mario RPG and A Link to the Past
01:11:46 but they're all games from the 90s
01:11:48 and like you never see
01:11:50 NES games getting in here
01:11:52 and if you were trying to make the
01:11:54 the like
01:11:56 if you were trying to say that these games were legacy games
01:11:58 that it was just because of how influential it was
01:12:00 we would have
01:12:02 NES games, we would have those old
01:12:04 games and there's people from that era
01:12:06 who still legitimately feel
01:12:08 as strongly towards those games as we do
01:12:10 towards Ocarina of Time
01:12:12 like how come Mario 1 isn't on the pole
01:12:14 but don't you think
01:12:16 that it's gonna
01:12:18 nobody says
01:12:20 that the best movie ever made
01:12:22 is like anything made in the last decade
01:12:24 everyone always says you know Citizen Kane
01:12:26 that really depends on who you ask though
01:12:28 okay okay
01:12:30 but I'm talking majority, I'm talking cultural consensus
01:12:32 on the best movie ever
01:12:34 is definitely old movies
01:12:36 there's this great article
01:12:38 that I'd love to dig up
01:12:40 or something for this but like
01:12:42 there's a huge
01:12:44 identity crisis when it comes to video games
01:12:46 where people don't look back
01:12:48 people don't play
01:12:50 this article
01:12:52 it was written by a guy who was teaching a game design
01:12:54 class and he asked
01:12:56 everyone in the class to raise their hand
01:12:58 if they're a fan of the Elder Scrolls series
01:13:00 and like
01:13:02 a majority of the class raises their hands
01:13:04 right and then he asks them
01:13:06 like how many have played Skyrim
01:13:08 and like most of them have their hands up
01:13:10 and then he asks like how many of you have played Oblivion
01:13:12 and like more than half of them lower their hands
01:13:14 and then he asks how many have played Morrowind
01:13:16 and he gets down to like two people
01:13:18 and he asks how many of you have played
01:13:20 Daggerfall and it's nobody
01:13:22 and like what a fucking hipster
01:13:24 well that's just a shameful degradation of the time
01:13:26 right I'm so glad you brought this up Digi
01:13:28 cause it really reminds me of
01:13:30 the whole conceit behind
01:13:32 the remake of Final Fantasy 7
01:13:34 and the question is
01:13:36 why is it being made from an artistic perspective
01:13:38 there is no reason
01:13:40 the game is fine because it'll sell
01:13:42 and people don't want to look back at the old one
01:13:44 there is absolutely nothing preventing
01:13:46 anyone from playing that game
01:13:48 they just want to you know make it again
01:13:50 so they can sell it again
01:13:52 and you know
01:13:54 I think the reason that some of the
01:13:56 like a link to the past and Ocarina of Time
01:13:58 specifically are the
01:14:00 like the older Zelda's that always succeed
01:14:02 but like personally
01:14:04 you know I've played all the old Zelda's
01:14:06 just two years ago
01:14:08 and I liked the first game
01:14:10 more than a link to the past
01:14:12 I thought it had like more
01:14:14 interesting ideas it had more interesting mechanics
01:14:16 and I think there's a huge contingent
01:14:18 of people who just think
01:14:20 it's old and they don't
01:14:22 want to play it cause it's old
01:14:24 I'll be honest that's why I haven't played it yet
01:14:26 right people look at the first game
01:14:28 and they think well isn't a link to the past
01:14:30 pretty much the exact same thing except
01:14:32 better and the answer is no
01:14:34 it doesn't play anything alike
01:14:36 I think the first game has better controls
01:14:38 because a link to the past is really
01:14:40 floaty it has a bad knockback
01:14:42 when enemies hit you it's really frustrating
01:14:44 sometimes whereas the first game
01:14:46 is like whatever you input is exactly
01:14:48 what happens on screen you know
01:14:50 exactly how your character moves stuff like that
01:14:52 the game is completely open-ended
01:14:54 it never tells you where to go
01:14:56 it's all about like just exploring this
01:14:58 world and sort of getting lost in it
01:15:00 whereas a link to the past is very
01:15:02 streamlined it tells you exactly
01:15:04 where to go next you know
01:15:06 and you know you use this item
01:15:08 on this specific dungeon whereas
01:15:10 in the first game like the items are useful forever
01:15:12 you always use everything forever
01:15:14 and like
01:15:16 it's just it's a different game
01:15:18 but people don't look at Zelda 1
01:15:20 they look at the games that they've
01:15:22 heard of that you know Ocarina of Time
01:15:24 and a link to the past were so influential that people
01:15:26 like the people just ignore them
01:15:28 but like if the people voting in game FAQs
01:15:30 polls were born
01:15:32 like 10 years earlier
01:15:34 like if there were more people
01:15:36 from like for instance
01:15:38 the game grump Danny Sex-Bang
01:15:40 he's like in his late 30s
01:15:42 and all the games he likes are NES games
01:15:44 like every game that he considers
01:15:46 like a classic that he knows how to play
01:15:48 that he's amazing at you know he loves
01:15:50 Zelda 1 he likes Zelda 2
01:15:52 you know and he's
01:15:54 he loves the link to the past as well
01:15:56 but like when you see him play the newer games
01:15:58 you can tell he doesn't feel as strongly about them
01:16:00 and it's like if more people
01:16:02 his age were voting we'd get stuff from the 80s
01:16:04 when people our age are voting we get stuff from
01:16:06 the 90s and I think we're entering a period
01:16:08 now where there's a lot of kids
01:16:10 who are voting in game FAQs
01:16:12 polls who were like my brother
01:16:14 Shade who is 18 now
01:16:16 he is a legal adult
01:16:18 he was born in 1997
01:16:20 he was born the year Final Fantasy 7
01:16:22 came out so there was
01:16:24 never a world for him where Final Fantasy 7
01:16:26 wasn't an old ass game
01:16:28 you know or Ocarina of Time
01:16:30 you know the first Zelda he would have seen
01:16:32 would have been Twilight Princess
01:16:34 oh my god I cannot believe that
01:16:36 I guess the idea
01:16:38 I mean I guess the idea with games is that because
01:16:40 there's like there was technological
01:16:42 improvement happening for a while there
01:16:44 new entries in the series
01:16:46 are basically just
01:16:48 improvements on the previous ones
01:16:50 even though everyone loves
01:16:52 Morrowind and everyone hates Oblivion
01:16:54 you say improvements
01:16:56 but like
01:16:58 I made that video about Final Fantasy 7 and the remake
01:17:00 like the remake is just
01:17:02 it's not going to have so many
01:17:04 of the things that I love about
01:17:06 Final Fantasy 7 like the janky weird animations
01:17:08 that are only done
01:17:10 because they couldn't express things the way that
01:17:12 I'm sure they wanted to but that as a result
01:17:14 are like one of my favorite things about that game
01:17:16 there's no way to
01:17:18 incorporate that sort of thing into the remake
01:17:20 it's just going to be replaced by
01:17:22 is really awkward, stilted
01:17:24 anime dialogue
01:17:26 I know dude I know
01:17:28 that's why I fucking hate voice acting
01:17:30 I hate voice acting in every sense
01:17:32 in games it should not be there let me
01:17:34 read the text because my imagination
01:17:36 is so much better than the best
01:17:38 voice actor you could possibly find
01:17:40 quick quick note on that
01:17:42 I understand why everyone
01:17:44 reads Papyrus' lines
01:17:46 like snidely whiplash but to me
01:17:48 in my head he never sounded like that
01:17:50 and it's really weird
01:17:52 like I get it I get it he goes
01:17:54 sounds like an evil laugh
01:17:56 he's tall and thin so he has
01:17:58 a reedy voice I get it but he never
01:18:00 sounded like that in my head
01:18:02 he's clearly Skeletor
01:18:04 no man that's
01:18:06 that's just not how he sounds to me
01:18:08 if you watch
01:18:10 like Skeletor
01:18:12 literally goes
01:18:14 he literally does that
01:18:16 inform Papyrus' character
01:18:18 those ne'ers were purposely put in there
01:18:20 I understand
01:18:22 the logic behind that
01:18:24 when I watch an undertale
01:18:26 fan like thing on youtube
01:18:28 and they're doing any kind of voice
01:18:30 for him that's not Skeletor I get pissed off
01:18:32 well I get pissed off but they do do
01:18:34 Skeletor
01:18:36 my life is suffering
01:18:38 he's objectively Skeletor and I'll fight
01:18:40 I'll fight anyone
01:18:42 here's here's head canon
01:18:44 Skeletor burned off the rest of his skin
01:18:46 and became Papyrus exactly now we know
01:18:48 there you go
01:18:50 I forgot the fuck I was gonna say
01:18:52 I'm talking about Final Fantasy 7 and Legacy
01:18:54 oh yeah you know the thing Ben
01:18:56 that you mentioned about like film
01:18:58 that people like old films
01:19:00 but there actually is a sort of
01:19:02 cutoff people like films from like the
01:19:04 fifties onwards because
01:19:06 it is the same with
01:19:08 technology advanced people don't go back
01:19:10 like you don't see a lot of
01:19:12 unless it's a real film you don't see
01:19:14 a lot of silent movies on this you might see
01:19:16 like Metropolis or something
01:19:18 like if the person is really
01:19:20 it like you know or that one about going
01:19:22 to the moon yeah like how come Pong
01:19:24 never comes up on like best game ever when it
01:19:26 did it all baby it started
01:19:28 you know Digi Digi you
01:19:30 make a good point I guess there is like a cutoff
01:19:32 in technology whereas like before that
01:19:34 no one like really considers them watchable
01:19:36 but then if but that's the funny
01:19:38 thing though is that it's it those
01:19:40 movies aren't worse
01:19:42 like because if you do know film bus like
01:19:44 go watch you know every frame of painting
01:19:46 talk about Buster Keaton's films and like
01:19:48 all the the technicality of those that
01:19:50 like hasn't even been topped today
01:19:52 you know and and yet you don't see them
01:19:54 on anyone's favorites list you know people
01:19:56 don't talk about them as much they talk about
01:19:58 Casablanca and Citizen Kane because
01:20:00 everyone knows about them and you know
01:20:02 they're they're famous
01:20:04 you know people don't talk as much about
01:20:06 the older movies I mean some critics
01:20:08 do I mean if you get like Roger Ebert
01:20:10 he's going to talk about all those old ass
01:20:12 fucking movies that make a great you know
01:20:14 he is dead but like he his great
01:20:16 movies reviews would span the whole
01:20:18 history of film because he knew the
01:20:20 medium and he knew that even
01:20:22 silent movies could do things that
01:20:24 movies now can't do you know
01:20:26 I actually watched a bunch
01:20:28 of metropolis although I was
01:20:30 playing a coheedy camera music
01:20:32 over it and
01:20:34 I was really interested in like
01:20:36 the makeup effects and stuff that are totally
01:20:38 different from what they would be now because
01:20:40 like to look right on film they would like
01:20:42 take on tons of like dark makeup
01:20:44 under their eyes and stuff and it looks
01:20:46 really cool and I was like man this
01:20:48 movie has a look that I would love
01:20:50 to see emulated in modern
01:20:52 technology but like I don't think it has
01:20:54 been and
01:20:56 you know so like even those ancient fucking
01:20:58 movies still have things that are interesting
01:21:00 that can teach you about film and inspire
01:21:02 new things and
01:21:04 games can do the same you know I've
01:21:06 going back and playing a game like
01:21:08 Zelda 1 really made me think about like
01:21:10 man I would love to see the Zelda
01:21:12 franchise kind of like get back
01:21:14 to this and then like they released
01:21:16 the what's it called
01:21:18 the fucking A Link Between Worlds
01:21:20 which is interesting
01:21:22 because it plays more like
01:21:24 it's a sequel to A Link to the Past
01:21:26 and they were playing it up like oh you can
01:21:28 choose whichever order you want to do the dungeons
01:21:30 and it's like A Link to the Past had that
01:21:32 in Dark World but this game
01:21:34 does it much more similarly to the first
01:21:36 game where it was like you just kind
01:21:38 of find things on your own and pick up
01:21:40 whatever weapons you want and use them here
01:21:42 and there you know it's sort of a hybrid of
01:21:44 Zelda 1 and A Link to the Past
01:21:46 like taking the best elements of each
01:21:48 and sort of hybridizing them and
01:21:50 it's like cool I don't think a lot
01:21:52 of people would have even known
01:21:54 that because they haven't played Zelda 1
01:21:56 you know but yeah
01:21:58 I think looking back can be interesting
01:22:00 and I think that's why so many indie games
01:22:02 that look back and have like
01:22:04 you know retro feel but they take
01:22:06 like retro ideas and put new spins
01:22:08 on them are so big right now
01:22:10 because
01:22:12 you know a lot of people think it's like oh it's nostalgia
01:22:14 but it's like Shovel Knight's not popular
01:22:16 because everyone who played Shovel Knight
01:22:18 had also played Mega Man in Castlevania
01:22:20 it's popular because it took those
01:22:22 ideas and did something interesting
01:22:24 with them you know
01:22:26 I want to disagree I think that is part of the reason
01:22:28 why it's popular is because it harkens
01:22:30 back to those games from the day
01:22:32 well okay okay but I think that has
01:22:34 a lot to do with the context of games
01:22:36 coming out today in the way like
01:22:38 all these big games are these big like
01:22:40 3D
01:22:42 Unreal Engine
01:22:44 like action adventure shooter games
01:22:46 that's like when you want to make a game to sell
01:22:48 like that's what you go to
01:22:50 if you want to make a big AAA game
01:22:52 and people are getting kind of bored with it
01:22:54 and so when someone makes a game that appeals
01:22:56 to some other aspect
01:22:58 what's happening with AAA games
01:23:00 is that they're all homogenizing because
01:23:02 they have to sell them
01:23:04 they have to sell so many fucking copies
01:23:06 that they can't afford not to sell them to literally everyone
01:23:08 so the game has to appeal to literally
01:23:10 everyone and then the indie games
01:23:12 don't have to appeal to basically anybody
01:23:14 except for like 10 people
01:23:16 except the one making it basically
01:23:18 okay let me
01:23:20 I found a blog the other day
01:23:22 actually I was looking at Davoo's Twitter
01:23:24 and Davoo follows these guys
01:23:26 called the Indie Game Advisors
01:23:28 oh yeah it's like a troll
01:23:30 and one of their tweets was like
01:23:32 there's only one place for your game
01:23:34 Zero Feedback
01:23:36 and it was a link and it linked to a
01:23:38 blog called Zero Feedback
01:23:40 that is a blog that collects and reviews
01:23:42 games that have been made
01:23:44 and posted online
01:23:46 and three months or more after being
01:23:48 posted have gotten zero comments
01:23:50 from anyone
01:23:52 gone completely unnoticed
01:23:54 amazing
01:23:56 wait what were we just saying that got me on this topic
01:23:58 that games cost a million dollars to make
01:24:00 and that they're all appealing to the same
01:24:02 don't have to appeal to anybody
01:24:04 I was scrolling through the list and some of them were really interesting
01:24:06 but one of them started was like
01:24:08 games are made for different audience
01:24:10 some games are made to be
01:24:12 a meta commentary on gaming in general
01:24:14 some games aren't meant to be played at all
01:24:16 and
01:24:18 the game is like a birthday present
01:24:20 like the dev just made the game
01:24:22 it's an interactive cake blower
01:24:24 like candle blower out some matter
01:24:26 made for his friend as a birthday
01:24:28 and there's two versions
01:24:30 like made on two different years and like
01:24:32 the second one is like this weird like
01:24:34 like lion puzzle
01:24:36 but the one that was like
01:24:38 Jesse beating up um
01:24:40 who was it, what critic was it that you beat up Jesse
01:24:42 oh I don't even remember
01:24:44 Razor Fist I don't know
01:24:46 it was that um
01:24:48 every time you hit them their sub count
01:24:50 was subtracted and put into your sub count
01:24:52 oh yeah
01:24:54 wait Davoo made a game
01:24:56 Davoo's made a bunch of games
01:24:58 I know he's made games but I haven't seen any of them
01:25:00 he's made a few RPGs that he said
01:25:02 actually have a lot of the ideas that
01:25:04 Undertale did and he realized it later
01:25:06 that's interesting
01:25:08 it was the cinemasins people
01:25:10 yeah it was cinemasins he made a game where Jesse
01:25:12 Jesse said he wanted to beat up cinemasins
01:25:14 and then Davoo made a game where Jesse
01:25:16 beats up cinemasins and takes their subscribers
01:25:18 that reminds me of
01:25:20 my idea about a youtuber
01:25:22 gambling ring where you can gamble your subscribers
01:25:24 and if you lose
01:25:26 your subscribers go to the winner
01:25:28 what a great idea
01:25:30 I know right
01:25:32 but anyway
01:25:34 if only there was some way to transfer subscribers
01:25:36 it would totally work
01:25:38 I'll agree with you on the idea that
01:25:40 I'm sure Shovel Knight was like
01:25:42 initial success is based on
01:25:44 nostalgia but like both of my little brothers
01:25:46 played that game and neither one of them has played
01:25:48 fuck all old games
01:25:50 they have not played a single NES or Super Nintendo game
01:25:52 in their fucking lives
01:25:54 Victor's never played a Super Nintendo game
01:25:56 Victor is like super against
01:25:58 going back to old games
01:26:00 he finds it so hard
01:26:02 to play a game that doesn't look pretty
01:26:04 that it's like
01:26:06 kills him
01:26:08 I have done God's work
01:26:10 by way of Nintendo
01:26:12 and gotten him Final Fantasy 7
01:26:14 and he's starting it up now
01:26:16 if he likes pretty games
01:26:18 forget the Legos
01:26:20 those pre-rendered backgrounds man
01:26:22 they're gorgeous
01:26:24 get the fuck out of here whoever said that
01:26:26 I'm just saying I think by most people's
01:26:28 definition of what a pretty game is
01:26:30 most people are literally retarded
01:26:32 I'm a really big fan of
01:26:34 static pre-rendered
01:26:36 backgrounds
01:26:38 best environments
01:26:40 fuck anyone who says the graphics are bad
01:26:42 they don't know what the hell they're talking about
01:26:44 when you're fucking walking and shit's going on in the background
01:26:46 and there's fucking like cannons
01:26:48 flying and like the weapon is coming towards you
01:26:50 remember how when you walk outside of Eris's church
01:26:52 and it's like tiny and it looks like
01:26:54 so out of proportion it's so adorable
01:26:56 and I love it and it's the best
01:26:58 the best
01:27:00 when it zooms out in the intro
01:27:02 it shows the logo on the screen
01:27:04 and then it zooms right back into the train
01:27:06 and then directly to gameplay
01:27:08 seamlessly
01:27:10 how did they do that with the camera
01:27:12 they can't even do that
01:27:14 nowadays I've never seen that in any game ever
01:27:16 since then before then
01:27:18 the best game ever made and we finally
01:27:20 solved the problem it is objectively
01:27:22 look at red13's dad
01:27:24 look at his character model
01:27:26 it's a piece of shit
01:27:28 you gotta admit though
01:27:30 that it would have been
01:27:32 look at the fucking aliased jagged edges
01:27:34 sometimes when the camera is moving
01:27:36 and how fucking janky it is
01:27:38 fucking complete a total biscuit
01:27:40 about your anti-aliasing
01:27:44 I wish
01:27:46 I will say this
01:27:48 I wish that if they were gonna do a Final Fantasy 7 remake
01:27:50 then you know
01:27:52 you said that the scene where the train stops
01:27:54 and it seamlessly transitions to gameplay
01:27:56 you can tell
01:27:58 the moment where the train stops
01:28:00 being a 3D model and starts being
01:28:02 part of the background
01:28:04 you can see that moment
01:28:06 that's the kind of thing
01:28:08 that if they were gonna do a remake of Final Fantasy 7
01:28:10 just fix that
01:28:12 just make it look like the train is the same train
01:28:14 that's such a small thing
01:28:16 that would just enhance the immersion
01:28:18 it wouldn't change anything
01:28:20 it doesn't change the artistic nature of the game
01:28:22 it's just now the train is the same train
01:28:26 I'm gonna be that guy
01:28:28 and just say that changing anything about the original
01:28:30 will make it worse
01:28:32 I don't care if it's improvement
01:28:34 I don't care if you fix any bugs
01:28:36 I love every bug
01:28:38 every glitch, every bit of shitty anti-aliasing
01:28:40 only because it's tied to that experience
01:28:42 so any change will be
01:28:44 it'll feel wrong
01:28:46 Jesse's motto, you're supposed to love the flaws
01:28:48 in someone you love
01:28:50 I keep referencing
01:28:52 in my videos because I love them so much
01:28:54 the real Silent Hill experience guys
01:28:56 Twin Perfect
01:28:58 I love the HD remake
01:29:00 they say it all
01:29:02 I was gonna say it's like Silent Hill
01:29:04 changing anything
01:29:06 even changing the things that suck about it
01:29:08 they make that point
01:29:10 that every flaw, every mistake
01:29:12 whatever is a mistake to you
01:29:14 who's redoing it
01:29:16 but it was put there, they made a choice to leave it there
01:29:18 and all that was the context for making the game
01:29:20 and to change it is just disrespectful to the original
01:29:22 you know a game that I should play
01:29:24 are you talking about Silent Hill Shattered Memories
01:29:26 because I love that game
01:29:28 the HD versions of
01:29:30 2 and 3
01:29:32 they're garbage
01:29:34 I haven't played the original
01:29:36 so Jesse I know you have
01:29:38 I don't know about the other guys
01:29:40 but I wanna know your opinion on Resident Evil 1
01:29:42 versus the GameCube version
01:29:44 the GameCube version
01:29:46 is the exception that proves the rule
01:29:48 because it's superior in every way
01:29:50 because when I was watching Nate's video
01:29:52 and I was like
01:29:54 on the one hand I agree
01:29:56 conceptually that changing things is a bad idea
01:29:58 but the GameCube version of Resident Evil
01:30:00 is a fucking masterpiece
01:30:02 yeah well okay
01:30:04 what was the situation for that game being made though
01:30:06 I'd really like to know because I don't know
01:30:08 it's the exact same game except they
01:30:10 made the controls not tank controls
01:30:12 and they made the
01:30:14 the pre-rendered backgrounds just
01:30:16 utterly beautiful
01:30:18 they were still tank controls on the GameCube
01:30:20 I think they took that out
01:30:22 in the HD version
01:30:24 they didn't remove the fantastic
01:30:26 cutscenes or anything did
01:30:28 they made new cutscenes
01:30:30 they put like whole new
01:30:32 stories of them
01:30:34 they did change the dialogue
01:30:36 to make it less corny
01:30:38 do you like it better that way
01:30:40 cause a lot of people love the corny ones
01:30:42 I was gonna say there's things about the original
01:30:44 still that you can't duplicate
01:30:46 the corny dialogue is pretty
01:30:48 fucking cool in the original
01:30:50 he does not say you were almost a Jill
01:30:52 sandwich this time
01:30:54 are you the master of unlocking
01:30:56 yeah he doesn't say that
01:30:58 but like
01:31:00 I definitely don't see the remake as
01:31:02 being something that could replace the original
01:31:04 I think that's good
01:31:06 that's what matters
01:31:08 mmhmm
01:31:10 but I think
01:31:12 I think
01:31:14 would you say that if someone
01:31:16 told you that they've only played
01:31:18 the remake of Resident Evil
01:31:20 and that they're not interested in playing the first one
01:31:22 do you think you would say
01:31:24 you would be like okay with that
01:31:26 I'd think less of them but I'd be okay with it
01:31:28 I guess
01:31:30 sadly I think I do want to play that game
01:31:32 I will probably play the remake
01:31:34 but I don't want it to
01:31:36 I would rather have been in a situation where there was only one
01:31:38 to play so that I could get the experience
01:31:40 just by playing the game
01:31:42 the thing is Resident Evil on the GameCube
01:31:44 is like the
01:31:46 most gorgeous fucking game ever
01:31:48 like it is
01:31:50 the most beautiful game
01:31:52 I've ever seen
01:31:54 and I think it does a lot
01:31:56 for the game that it looks that way
01:31:58 where like
01:32:00 there's parts in that game where you walk
01:32:02 into a room and just the
01:32:04 level of detail and the way the lighting
01:32:06 is fucking terrifying
01:32:08 just the way the room looks
01:32:10 you walk into a room and
01:32:12 you'll be like facing the camera
01:32:14 and your character model looks
01:32:16 really realistic and the lighting looks
01:32:18 realistic and it just puts you in this weird
01:32:20 frame of mind where you're like oh god
01:32:22 I'm really here and things are really
01:32:24 killing me
01:32:26 because it looks so hyper real and they got away with it
01:32:28 because it's all pre-rendered
01:32:30 so they could draw as much detail
01:32:32 into the backgrounds as they wanted
01:32:34 they didn't have to worry about lighting
01:32:36 that's the joy of pre-rendering dude
01:32:38 why doesn't anyone do pre-rendering anymore
01:32:40 god it's a shame
01:32:42 I think you can
01:32:44 that's what's so cool about like
01:32:46 nobody big does it
01:32:48 what's so cool about 2D games like Muramasa
01:32:50 is that they can do shit like that
01:32:52 every single background be like
01:32:54 the most opulent thing you've ever seen
01:32:56 but I think it fell out with
01:32:58 3D games because people bitch about the cameras
01:33:00 people don't want to have the camera
01:33:02 constantly changing modes
01:33:04 that's why tank controls are
01:33:06 important
01:33:08 in the HD version
01:33:10 it doesn't have tank controls
01:33:12 but I never found it confusing
01:33:14 like I was just
01:33:16 I thought it worked perfectly fine
01:33:18 even in Final Fantasy 7
01:33:20 it can get confusing sometimes walking between screens
01:33:22 and it doesn't have tank controls
01:33:24 and I remember several times
01:33:26 I'll walk back through a place
01:33:28 just because the camera changes completely
01:33:30 the worst in Final Fantasy 7
01:33:32 is that tunnel
01:33:34 in the beginning where
01:33:36 it's really confusing to tell
01:33:38 if you're supposed to go forward or backwards
01:33:40 I know exactly what you're talking about underground
01:33:42 I've actually heard that
01:33:44 referred to as the noob tunnel
01:33:46 where people have gotten so lost
01:33:48 in that tunnel that they quit playing the game
01:33:50 because they couldn't figure out what to do
01:33:52 is that the long tunnel that just goes
01:33:54 really far in both directions
01:33:56 it's like when you're waiting
01:33:58 to Shinra HQ
01:34:00 and you're trying to get there
01:34:02 and you go through all these subway tunnels
01:34:04 I kinda like that
01:34:06 I mean it's a cool place
01:34:08 but it is confusing
01:34:10 that's true
01:34:12 I'm changing my vote
01:34:14 my favorite game of all time is frog fractions
01:34:16 I like number munch
01:34:18 math plaster
01:34:20 have you guys played frog fractions
01:34:22 no I've never heard of it
01:34:24 I have played it on your suggestion
01:34:26 and it was great
01:34:28 I must have made you play frog fractions
01:34:30 you guys should play frog fractions
01:34:32 another frog game that goes crazy
01:34:34 am I thinking of this
01:34:36 there's a dragon
01:34:38 oh yeah I have played that
01:34:40 I remember that game
01:34:42 where it turns into like a million different games
01:34:44 yeah that's right
01:34:46 so I'm looking at this article
01:34:48 and apparently frog fractions too
01:34:50 is coming out
01:34:52 but it's coming out
01:34:54 by way of some insanely
01:34:56 convoluted alternate reality game
01:34:58 that involves like
01:35:00 weird
01:35:02 real life performance art pieces
01:35:04 guys let's all play frog fractions
01:35:06 that sounds fucking awesome
01:35:08 I'm reading about it right now
01:35:10 holy shit I'd forgotten about frog fractions
01:35:12 but god damn
01:35:14 you know what you're right I'm changing my vote
01:35:16 frog fractions is objectively the best game ever
01:35:18 I'm so glad we were able to come to consensus
01:35:20 this is a progressive
01:35:22 not even that this convoluted release method
01:35:24 means that frog fractions too is the best game ever
01:35:26 and it doesn't even exist
01:35:28 certainly the best franchise
01:35:30 that is a phenomenal game
01:35:32 that honestly probably would make my list of
01:35:34 like top 5 games ever
01:35:36 my game of the year
01:35:38 for 2015 is
01:35:40 dengeki bunko fighting climax
01:35:44 technically it came out last year in Japan
01:35:46 but it came out this year in the US
01:35:48 and it's
01:35:50 possibly my favorite fighting game
01:35:52 that's not called super smash brothers
01:35:54 I play as kozaka kirino
01:35:56 from ore no we motoga
01:35:58 nani kawai wake ganai
01:36:00 or my little sister can't possibly be this cute
01:36:04 and she's
01:36:06 I kick everybody's ass with her
01:36:08 and she has
01:36:10 really fun moveset
01:36:12 and she's like the most satisfying character
01:36:14 to play in a video game
01:36:16 I've ever played
01:36:18 I'm going to give you guys a spoiler
01:36:20 I'm going to give you guys a spoiler
01:36:22 for future best guy ever
01:36:24 episode
01:36:26 kirino
01:36:28 the worst creation
01:36:30 in the history of mankind
01:36:32 she is an abomination
01:36:34 she is an utterly
01:36:36 reprehensible
01:36:38 piece of human garbage
01:36:40 and it is my mission in life
01:36:42 to obliterate her memory
01:36:44 from the face of the earth
01:36:46 I'm going to fucking recreate Hiroshima
01:36:48 if it means one more person
01:36:50 will not
01:36:52 fuck kirino
01:36:54 I'm surprised you haven't bought
01:36:56 dengeki bunko fighting climax
01:36:58 just so you can beat her up
01:37:00 I'll go pirate it
01:37:02 I can't give money to the people
01:37:04 who created kirino
01:37:06 but I will get it
01:37:08 you're misrepresenting
01:37:10 the problem guy
01:37:12 the problem is not that she's a terrible person
01:37:14 the problem is that
01:37:16 the show is a terrible show
01:37:18 that wants you to like her
01:37:20 the biggest problem
01:37:22 are the people around
01:37:24 kirino who enable her
01:37:26 but if we eliminate her
01:37:28 and who the show then goes on to celebrate
01:37:30 as having done the right thing
01:37:32 I feel like if we kill her
01:37:34 that's at least one scourge
01:37:36 of
01:37:38 badness
01:37:40 I want to fight you
01:37:42 with kirino
01:37:44 I will be kirino
01:37:46 you be kirino
01:37:48 we will have the ultimate fucking battle
01:37:50 see the problem is that
01:37:52 kirito sucks
01:37:54 and kirino is like the god tier character
01:37:56 I'll do whatever it takes
01:37:58 I've got determination man
01:38:00 oh he's bringing it back undertale
01:38:02 yes we did talk about
01:38:04 that's why I wanted to bring up
01:38:06 my favorite game is dengeki bunko fighting climax
01:38:08 it's not undertale
01:38:10 even of this year
01:38:12 I also like axiom verge more than undertale
01:38:14 but I don't know
01:38:16 axiom verge is a game
01:38:18 I don't like undertale made me think
01:38:20 more
01:38:22 axiom verge did not make me think
01:38:24 a lot but it's a game
01:38:26 that I definitely see myself playing again
01:38:28 in a year or two
01:38:30 undertale I don't think I will ever play again
01:38:32 I find the
01:38:34 gameplay to be extremely
01:38:36 frustrating and I hate it
01:38:38 I'm going to play undertale the way I play
01:38:40 final fantasy 7 I think
01:38:42 which is just every couple of years
01:38:44 just take the journey and just do it
01:38:46 just to re-immers
01:38:48 yeah I know
01:38:50 I don't really see myself playing it again
01:38:52 I think I've gotten
01:38:54 all there is to get out of the
01:38:56 I think I'll play it again
01:38:58 I already played it a third time and didn't even intend to
01:39:00 was that mage?
01:39:02 I want to say I play undertale again but I feel bad
01:39:06 you don't have to do
01:39:08 genocide or anything
01:39:10 oh right but if you reset
01:39:12 me and Shade were going to do
01:39:14 a let's play
01:39:16 because we were drinking and he was big
01:39:18 into undertale so he was like why don't you just start
01:39:20 up another undertale run and then I turned on the
01:39:22 game and Flowey showed up
01:39:24 and started talking to me and literally asking me
01:39:26 not to do it and I was like
01:39:28 well if I'm not supposed to do it in the context
01:39:30 of the narrative then I won't do it
01:39:32 oh that's so great
01:39:34 that's why I love undertale
01:39:36 you all this time
01:39:38 have been saying
01:39:40 you guys keep saying oh you didn't do a genocide run
01:39:42 you weren't here
01:39:44 you have been heckling me for a week
01:39:46 telling me I have to kill everyone
01:39:48 you piece of shit
01:39:50 you are definitely a better person if you do not play
01:39:52 genocide but you do not
01:39:54 get the game you just don't
01:39:56 you don't know everything
01:39:58 that's stupid you're accepting
01:40:00 the game's logic uncritically
01:40:02 playing a genocide run does not
01:40:04 make you a worse person no matter how much the game tries
01:40:06 to tell you it does
01:40:08 you killed all your friends
01:40:10 even Toby said why would you do a genocide run
01:40:12 he put it there
01:40:14 I don't think that it makes you a worse person
01:40:16 it's a temptation you're supposed to resist
01:40:18 I think that it means
01:40:20 the game's putting one over on you
01:40:22 and it refuse
01:40:24 to play by its rules
01:40:26 all of those things
01:40:28 you are constructed as temptations that you are supposed to resist
01:40:30 you can do what you want
01:40:32 I don't even think it's tempting
01:40:34 I did not reach the end of the game
01:40:36 I sure want to kill all these guys
01:40:38 that would be interesting
01:40:40 that's why I did it
01:40:42 I wanted to know
01:40:44 it's that there's additional content
01:40:46 and it's honestly really good content
01:40:48 that's why it's such an effective tool
01:40:50 I think the reason
01:40:52 the reason that there's
01:40:54 like a divide of people
01:40:56 that don't want to do it
01:40:58 don't even think that it would be a fun time
01:41:00 not like it would be fun
01:41:02 but like they don't want to do it
01:41:04 not just because it's nasty
01:41:06 but because they just don't care
01:41:08 and I think it's like
01:41:10 the game
01:41:12 undertale
01:41:14 if you end up wanting
01:41:16 to not do the genocide run
01:41:18 it's like it's affected you in that way
01:41:20 it just speaks more to
01:41:22 like the character
01:41:24 writing
01:41:26 if you don't feel a desire
01:41:28 to do the genocide run
01:41:30 I think the game has kind of failed
01:41:32 in what it was trying to do
01:41:34 I think it's trying to incentivize you to do it
01:41:36 I think, no, you know what
01:41:38 I'm gonna say it like this
01:41:40 I think there are
01:41:42 two equally valid endings
01:41:44 to undertale
01:41:46 one where you keep going and you do genocide
01:41:48 and one where you don't
01:41:50 and I think that
01:41:52 you could say that the genocide run
01:41:54 has a lot of the interesting content in the game
01:41:56 but I think it's equally interesting
01:41:58 to play a game and then for that game
01:42:00 to actually convince you
01:42:02 you don't want to play it again
01:42:04 I totally agree with you
01:42:06 that is legitimate
01:42:08 I think every single ending
01:42:10 is totally fine
01:42:12 my whole thing is
01:42:14 I love that the genocide run exists
01:42:16 and I respect what it does
01:42:18 as a work of art
01:42:20 the fact that it gives you that choice
01:42:22 and tries to tempt you is like the coolest
01:42:24 most unique artistic thing that
01:42:26 in many years, however
01:42:28 me personally
01:42:30 Toby Fox is not smarter than me
01:42:32 I'm not going to fall for his shit
01:42:34 I'm not going to let him browbeat me
01:42:36 and talk down to me for doing something
01:42:38 that he tried to get me to do
01:42:40 so he can suck a dick
01:42:42 I'll never play the genocide run
01:42:44 he'll never fucking trick me
01:42:46 and I'll never fall for his metal bullshit
01:42:48 because I'm better than him
01:42:50 the problem is you know everything already
01:42:52 so you don't have any desire to play
01:42:54 like Toby
01:42:56 it's weird for the game
01:42:58 to look down on you
01:43:00 when he programmed this
01:43:02 into the game
01:43:04 he's the bad guy
01:43:06 he made the genocide run
01:43:08 a choice into the game
01:43:10 so of course there had to be a negative choice
01:43:12 it's up to you to do what you want
01:43:14 let me just explain to me the logic
01:43:16 he's like God
01:43:18 judging me for masturbating when he gave me a dick in the first place
01:43:20 that's right
01:43:22 when I played through the game
01:43:24 on my first run
01:43:26 even though I was going for pacifist
01:43:28 I ended up killing some people
01:43:30 and resetting
01:43:32 I killed Toriel and then I reset to do it again
01:43:34 and got the happy ending
01:43:36 I killed Undyne because I couldn't figure out what to do with her
01:43:38 and I saw her fucking death
01:43:40 which is awesome by the way
01:43:42 if you haven't seen her neutral death
01:43:44 it's fucking heartbreaking
01:43:46 it's wicked cool
01:43:48 sad as well
01:43:50 okay spoilers
01:43:52 you know how in
01:43:54 Jesse don't listen if you don't want to spoil
01:43:56 you know how in genocide
01:43:58 when you kill her she starts melting
01:44:00 but she's like no everyone's counting on me
01:44:02 I've gotta defeat you
01:44:04 it is the best moment in the game
01:44:06 and then she wills herself back to life through determination
01:44:08 and becomes the ultimate champion
01:44:10 in a neutral run
01:44:12 she tries to do that
01:44:14 but because you're not the ultimate monster
01:44:16 she can't summon the determination to do it
01:44:18 and she's like no I won't die
01:44:20 I can't die I won't die
01:44:22 that's genius
01:44:24 brilliant I love it
01:44:26 she's like no
01:44:28 I can't and then she just melts away
01:44:30 I would suck that dog's dick any day
01:44:32 no it's wicked good
01:44:34 so I saw that and I loved it
01:44:36 but I was sad so I
01:44:38 reset and undid it and saved the game
01:44:40 saved her
01:44:42 and then I got to the end
01:44:44 and
01:44:46 and if Toriel dies
01:44:48 she has a good scene too
01:44:50 so I really wanted to see the ultimate content
01:44:52 so I was like of course I'm gonna do the genocide
01:44:54 because
01:44:56 I want to see
01:44:58 and that is exactly the point
01:45:00 that's sort of the point the game's making
01:45:02 the funny thing is I hate games
01:45:04 having multiple paths
01:45:06 I never do multiple paths in a game
01:45:08 like if it's a game that has
01:45:10 three endings I'll take the ending I got
01:45:12 I don't give a fuck
01:45:14 I think
01:45:16 there's a lot of people who they get to the end
01:45:18 and they're like you have to get
01:45:20 the true ending the perfect ending
01:45:22 you have to get the one where you did everything right
01:45:24 and you saved everybody and I'm like
01:45:26 I'm just gonna take whatever ending I get
01:45:28 if I played in a way
01:45:30 where I fucked up then this is the ending
01:45:32 that my story has
01:45:34 I'm one of those people who always
01:45:36 does whatever it takes to get the true ending
01:45:38 on the first playthrough
01:45:40 I don't know if I'm going to be able
01:45:42 to put in the time
01:45:44 to do it again
01:45:46 and I never risk that I'll
01:45:48 get about and have to play through another game
01:45:50 I feel like the world we live in
01:45:52 you can't restart anything
01:45:54 right you go through
01:45:56 you're totally right
01:45:58 I get why for video games
01:46:00 it's an escape from the real world
01:46:02 it's a world where you can do everything again
01:46:04 you can make everything perfect
01:46:06 and have your Groundhog's Day loop
01:46:08 you saved everybody and the end is great
01:46:10 but like
01:46:12 for me I just kind of like to take
01:46:14 what comes and be like
01:46:16 I mean mostly out of impatience
01:46:18 I don't want to fucking play through the whole game
01:46:20 twice or redo things
01:46:22 I never save scum in any game
01:46:24 unless it's fucking Fire Emblem
01:46:26 cause I'm not going to let any of my characters die
01:46:28 I also do it out of impatience
01:46:30 it's exactly the same as Fire Emblem for me
01:46:32 I cannot let any character
01:46:34 die in Fire Emblem ever
01:46:36 it's an impossibility for me
01:46:38 we'll never do it and I cannot
01:46:40 to me it seems like if you let a character die
01:46:42 you lost the game
01:46:44 that's right
01:46:46 you could win any battle
01:46:48 if you just do enough soldiers at it
01:46:50 that's my obsession with getting the true best ending
01:46:52 I totally understand
01:46:54 obviously because in Fire Emblem
01:46:56 all the characters are characters and individuals
01:46:58 you don't want any of them to die
01:47:00 because it would feel really terrible
01:47:02 and not only that
01:47:04 but at least just try again
01:47:06 so there's no excuse for letting them die
01:47:08 and so I'm totally with you
01:47:10 on why you would want to redo it
01:47:12 however in games like that
01:47:14 I think it really ups the stakes
01:47:16 and makes it a lot more engaging
01:47:18 and ultimately fun
01:47:20 if you decide ahead of time
01:47:22 I will not reset to save anyone
01:47:24 if I fuck up and die
01:47:26 I have a thought about that
01:47:28 but I suck at Fire Emblem
01:47:30 so like if I tried to play that way
01:47:32 I'm fucked
01:47:34 it would obviously
01:47:36 make things a lot harder
01:47:38 it'd be like Nuzlocking
01:47:40 doing a Nuzlocke run
01:47:42 of a Fire Emblem
01:47:44 I love Nuzlocke runs
01:47:46 and I love the idea of Nuzlocke runs
01:47:48 but the game is so not balanced for it
01:47:50 and it takes so much grinding that I don't think I'll ever do another one
01:47:52 you don't have to restart your game
01:47:54 when you lose your Pokemon
01:47:56 you just pick up a new Pokemon
01:47:58 and just play with that one
01:48:00 if your Pokemon dies
01:48:02 you have to pick up one of your other ones
01:48:04 I think that is a lot more
01:48:06 convenient than trying to do Fire Emblem
01:48:08 without a character
01:48:10 you're a fool
01:48:12 because it's the opposite of convenient
01:48:14 everything about a Nuzlocke run
01:48:16 will destroy you forever
01:48:18 if you lose a character in Fire Emblem
01:48:20 and you go to the next level
01:48:22 and you save your game
01:48:24 then you are fucked forever
01:48:26 because you can never get that character back
01:48:28 if you keep losing characters
01:48:30 you're just going to have to restart the whole game
01:48:32 with Nuzlocke
01:48:34 you will have to grind excessively
01:48:36 but you will never have to actually just reset the game
01:48:38 you know
01:48:40 in Fire Emblem
01:48:42 they give you way more characters than you can ever use
01:48:44 in one match
01:48:46 I've never gotten far enough
01:48:48 in Fire Emblem that I had the huge stock of characters
01:48:50 you can lose Pokemon
01:48:52 you can lose enough Pokemon
01:48:54 you can easily lose enough Pokemon
01:48:56 in a Nuzlocke run that you're completely fucked
01:48:58 you can also lose Pokemon
01:49:00 or just not gain Pokemon in the first place
01:49:02 through bad luck
01:49:04 so as to not have Pokemon on your team
01:49:06 so there's a rule that you can only use
01:49:08 each type of Pokemon once
01:49:10 oh you're talking about Nuzlocke now
01:49:12 no you can
01:49:14 you just catch the first
01:49:16 every area you come to you can catch the first one
01:49:18 so if you end up with
01:49:20 and if you fail to catch it
01:49:22 then you just don't have one
01:49:24 and if you start gold in Nuzlocke
01:49:26 I got to the Dragon Trainer
01:49:28 and I had
01:49:30 well I mean there's a whole terrible story
01:49:32 I had an Ice Pokemon
01:49:34 I had an Ice Pokemon
01:49:36 Brunswick the Mammoth Swine
01:49:38 he died tragically in a horrible Wabafit accident
01:49:40 disgusting piece of shit Wabafit worst Pokemon ever
01:49:42 but then because I went
01:49:44 and because of that
01:49:46 I was completely fucked against Claire the Dragon Trainer
01:49:48 got my shit wrecked
01:49:50 didn't actually game over
01:49:52 pretty much the next climactic encounter
01:49:56 where was I going?
01:49:58 we are way off the topic of what the best game ever is
01:50:00 well what's your point are you making a point with that?
01:50:02 well no but I will now
01:50:04 and I'll say
01:50:06 I think that it's highly
01:50:08 recommends Pokemon as a game
01:50:10 for best game ever
01:50:12 or some title like it
01:50:14 the way that it's systems are broad enough
01:50:16 that you can play it in multiple different ways
01:50:18 interesting though
01:50:20 how much of this like what do they call it
01:50:22 expanded gameplay
01:50:24 emergent gameplay
01:50:26 how much of that can be factored into
01:50:28 all of it
01:50:30 absolutely all of it
01:50:32 there are games
01:50:34 if you played God of War
01:50:36 you cannot do anything differently
01:50:38 from what the game is
01:50:40 there's no where to go
01:50:42 there's no other abilities you have
01:50:44 you just play through
01:50:46 I'm not criticizing God of War
01:50:48 if you play Dark Souls
01:50:50 you can play it in so many hundreds of different ways
01:50:52 that completely change it
01:50:54 where you can play a run where you only use the whip
01:50:56 and you're Simon Belmont
01:50:58 and it's Castlevania
01:51:00 I've watched people beat the game like that
01:51:02 I've watched a guy beat the game with a guitar hero controller
01:51:04 I've watched a guy
01:51:06 beat Dark Souls with voice commands
01:51:10 he was saying left, right, jump, dodge
01:51:12 left like that
01:51:14 I've watched him beat Ormstein and Smough
01:51:16 fucking voice commands
01:51:18 I've watched a guy
01:51:20 one of my friends beat the game at level one
01:51:22 he beat the game using only
01:51:24 shields, only two shields
01:51:26 for weapons
01:51:28 I've watched him
01:51:30 there's just so many ways
01:51:32 that you can beat the game
01:51:34 there's different ways that you can speedrun it
01:51:36 where you can do a natural speedrun
01:51:38 where you go all the way through or do a glitch speedrun
01:51:40 where you skip half the bosses
01:51:42 by jumping through the first flame
01:51:44 or whatever
01:51:46 what's the big one called
01:51:48 the giant bonfire
01:51:50 whatever, you know what I'm talking about
01:51:52 the Lord Vessel
01:51:54 there's a glitch you can do where you just go through that door
01:51:56 and completely bypass the whole
01:51:58 second half of the game
01:52:00 which is how the early speedruns were done
01:52:02 there's just a million
01:52:04 ways to play Dark Souls
01:52:06 and it makes it endlessly replayable
01:52:08 and super awesome
01:52:10 you're never done with the game until you decide
01:52:12 you're never done with the game
01:52:14 and even the nature of the story
01:52:16 supports that until you go hollow
01:52:18 the game is still going
01:52:20 and the cyclical nature of it
01:52:22 especially, I mean
01:52:24 I'd say that if there's one flaw
01:52:26 with Dark Souls that's not like a technical flaw
01:52:28 it's that the dark ending
01:52:30 doesn't seg you well into New Game Plus
01:52:32 because...
01:52:34 I like saying seg you, okay
01:52:36 seg way, god damn it
01:52:38 this podcast is over
01:52:40 I like saying seg you
01:52:42 anyway, but that's not the word
01:52:44 I just like saying it, it's my version
01:52:46 of the word
01:52:48 people give me shit about this all the time
01:52:50 but I like the word
01:52:52 the dark ending
01:52:54 does not seg way
01:52:56 and people won't stop giving me shit about it
01:52:58 what's going on?
01:53:00 the dark ending does not seg way well
01:53:02 into New Game Plus
01:53:04 whereas the light ending makes sense
01:53:06 as the cycle continues and you are the new
01:53:08 guy or whatever
01:53:10 I guess it doesn't make perfect sense because it's still Gwyn
01:53:12 at the end and it's not like your player character
01:53:14 or whatever, but like
01:53:16 it makes more sense
01:53:18 it feels more natural
01:53:20 I'm not sure the light ending particularly segways very well
01:53:22 into it
01:53:24 it would be like a cycle much later
01:53:26 segways well into what
01:53:28 into New Game Plus
01:53:30 Gwyn is back
01:53:32 and he shouldn't be back
01:53:34 I don't think that the New Game Plus
01:53:36 is part of the story
01:53:38 I don't think it's meant to be
01:53:40 people have argued this over which ending is better
01:53:42 for seguing into New Play Plus
01:53:44 I think the dark ending
01:53:46 both of them, all the bosses come back
01:53:48 and it doesn't make any sense
01:53:50 it's as much of a different world
01:53:52 does not make any sense
01:53:54 it's as much of a different world as someone else
01:53:56 who you summon, they come from their version of Lord
01:53:58 but if it wasn't
01:54:00 for that you could
01:54:02 isn't it supposed to be like an alternate dimension
01:54:04 that's right
01:54:06 because time is convoluted
01:54:08 you're a different guy who is on the same quest
01:54:10 so I think it's fine
01:54:12 whatever
01:54:14 I'd say that
01:54:16 but the game is pretty much
01:54:18 only over when you say it's over
01:54:20 and you can keep doing so many
01:54:22 new things with it
01:54:24 I feel like
01:54:26 I've watched my friends do upwards
01:54:28 of 40 runs of Dark Souls
01:54:30 and doing it
01:54:32 in so many different ways
01:54:34 there's a lot of ways to chug through the early part
01:54:36 first, there's a cool video
01:54:38 that I saw early into
01:54:40 when I was learning about all the different ways to play Dark Souls
01:54:42 that was everything you can do before the Gargoyles
01:54:44 and this dude just like
01:54:46 plows
01:54:48 he does like pretty much everything
01:54:50 aside from Sen's Fortress and Anor Londo
01:54:52 can be done before
01:54:54 and everything that comes after those
01:54:56 can be done before the Gargoyles
01:54:58 and
01:55:00 it's like mesmerizing to watch
01:55:02 people do shit like that
01:55:04 that's really cool but to bring it back
01:55:06 to the topic at hand
01:55:08 all that stuff is like
01:55:10 you really enjoy how the game
01:55:12 is open
01:55:14 to doing whatever you want
01:55:16 all these ways you can explore it
01:55:18 whereas in my opinion
01:55:20 I sort of am more focused on the story
01:55:22 and the
01:55:24 sort of the point of the game
01:55:26 like the specific story
01:55:28 it's just different ways of looking at it
01:55:30 and that's kind of the consensus here
01:55:32 everyone's got their own way of looking at shit
01:55:34 you want to know where best game ever debate becomes
01:55:36 really really interesting
01:55:38 is when you involve mods
01:55:40 and you have to argue for whether or not
01:55:42 you think that a game
01:55:44 is qualified to be compared
01:55:46 or to be like you know
01:55:48 celebrated when it has mods
01:55:50 on that basis like Skyrim
01:55:52 would probably be a lot of people's best game ever
01:55:54 just because it's got so much shit
01:55:56 I think that it is totally fair
01:55:58 I do too
01:56:00 you just have to specify
01:56:02 what you're talking about
01:56:04 for instance Super Bunny Hop
01:56:06 when he made his video on Fallout 4
01:56:08 he was saying on twitter
01:56:10 and in the video he kept saying
01:56:12 it's advisable to play this game 6 months from now
01:56:14 when it's been modded to the point
01:56:16 that it fixes all the issues
01:56:18 and I was like
01:56:20 what I want you to do Super Bunny Hop
01:56:22 and I said this on twitter I was like
01:56:24 6 months from now about the new game
01:56:26 because it is a new game at that point
01:56:28 it's a totally different game
01:56:30 now that it's got all these mods
01:56:32 and I think it's worth
01:56:34 celebrating
01:56:36 if you can mod a game
01:56:38 and make it the best game ever
01:56:40 then that's worth celebrating
01:56:42 and with Dark Souls the PC version
01:56:44 was definitely better than the PS3
01:56:46 because they made it so you could play it in 1080p
01:56:48 you could play it
01:56:50 but when it came out
01:56:52 they had it locked at 30 frames per second
01:56:54 they had it locked at
01:56:56 I don't think it was locked at 720
01:56:58 but like
01:57:00 the thing is there was a fix for it
01:57:02 the day the game launched
01:57:04 and Steam put
01:57:06 a link to that patch
01:57:08 on the front page of Steam
01:57:10 if you bought the game
01:57:12 it literally told you
01:57:14 the patch is right here
01:57:16 to fix it and so from day one
01:57:18 Dark Souls PC
01:57:20 even though like if you were writing a consumer review of it
01:57:22 people would be like
01:57:24 oh well the game has these locked frame rate issues
01:57:26 and it's a big problem and like
01:57:28 people want to punish the company
01:57:30 for not releasing it right
01:57:32 but from the very beginning
01:57:34 you could mod it in 5 seconds
01:57:36 and have it look beautiful
01:57:38 now see I have no problem with including that
01:57:40 as like a general review of the game
01:57:42 but the only thing and this is an aside
01:57:44 is I don't want the company to get that credit
01:57:46 it doesn't deserve the credit for
01:57:48 yeah but I think games should transcend
01:57:50 who created them
01:57:52 ultimately yes but just as a matter of like
01:57:54 economics it's you know
01:57:56 saying that mods don't
01:57:58 count in terms of determining
01:58:00 how good a game is or whether it's the best game ever
01:58:02 or whatever really smacks of like
01:58:04 I'm not saying that though
01:58:06 really I know you're not but
01:58:08 someone that did it really smacks of like objective
01:58:10 like you know best versus
01:58:12 favorite bullshit
01:58:14 well I think the problem with it
01:58:16 is that it turns
01:58:18 calling a game great
01:58:20 into just like an award
01:58:22 for the people who made it
01:58:24 as opposed to an award for the game
01:58:26 like you know we're trying to figure out
01:58:28 what is the best game
01:58:30 for us
01:58:32 we're not trying to find the best game ever
01:58:34 so that we can give a fucking trophy
01:58:36 to the people who made it
01:58:38 we're doing it to say like
01:58:40 according to us
01:58:42 is the most fun game to play
01:58:44 if mods make a game the best game ever
01:58:46 then it's the best game ever
01:58:48 regardless of you know
01:58:50 just credit the guy who made the fucking mod
01:58:52 if you're giving the trophy
01:58:54 to everybody just give it to the mod guy too
01:58:56 it's the best game ever
01:58:58 can you imagine like them ever share
01:59:00 like the Skyrim devs ever like sharing credit
01:59:02 with like the modding community
01:59:04 did you not hear about like this huge
01:59:06 controversial thing that happened where they tried to
01:59:08 make a like
01:59:10 they tried to monetize mods
01:59:12 yeah build a community of like
01:59:14 like oh we're gonna support the mods
01:59:16 and people have to pay for them
01:59:18 and it completely bombed and fell apart
01:59:20 that was just another way to like capitalize
01:59:22 on other people's work by the company
01:59:24 it didn't work out well
01:59:26 it was not a good idea
01:59:28 it'll be back though it'll be back
01:59:30 give it a couple years
01:59:32 in some form it might return
01:59:34 well
01:59:36 we've been going for two hours now
01:59:38 feel like we've covered a pretty good
01:59:40 of shit how do you guys feel
01:59:42 anybody got anything else to say
01:59:44 I can't believe I'm awake
01:59:46 I want to go back and retroactively
01:59:48 change what I said about Crazy Taxi
01:59:50 it is objectively the best game ever made
01:59:52 not just my favorite I'm on Ben's side now
01:59:54 it's both the same
01:59:56 good all right
01:59:58 good hippo man
02:00:00 what do you got to say
02:00:04 Undyne is the best girl
02:00:06 and I want to kiss her
02:00:08 fishy
02:00:10 vagina
02:00:12 why does Undyne have more hair
02:00:14 when she's on the date
02:00:16 because she's more attractive that way
02:00:18 she is to me
02:00:20 she was wearing it in a ponytail
02:00:22 but if you look at her head even from the back
02:00:24 the top of her head is blue
02:00:26 no she is obviously more attractive
02:00:28 that way but I'm saying why
02:00:30 in universe what is the explanation
02:00:32 for the fact that she has more hair
02:00:34 she grows the hair from the back
02:00:36 to the front
02:00:38 that is possible
02:00:40 it could just be resting not growing
02:00:42 she's got the
02:00:44 she's got the Prince Zuko top
02:00:46 thing going on
02:00:48 and Zuko looked like he had long hair
02:00:50 when it was down right
02:00:52 I don't know
02:00:54 he did Zuko looked
02:00:56 like he was bald everywhere but
02:00:58 when it was down
02:01:00 her little
02:01:02 battle sprite looks like
02:01:08 Undyne's
02:01:10 out of battle sprite looks almost completely bald
02:01:12 that's true it's just got the little tough
02:01:14 but you know what the fan art
02:01:16 looks a million billion times better with a
02:01:18 really tight ponytail
02:01:20 and if one thing's canon
02:01:22 it's fan art
02:01:24 there's also the scene later where she pulls her hair
02:01:26 for whatever
02:01:28 everyone thanks for joining
02:01:30 this was the first
02:01:32 possibly not even going up version
