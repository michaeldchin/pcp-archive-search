00:00:00 Hey, so Ben, about that Christmas thing.
00:00:05 Hey, about that Christmas joke I just made!
00:00:10 Um, I said Merry Christmas, and you said, you missed Christmas, and I said, what?
00:00:17 You mean I was visited by those three ghosts of Christmas, only to wake up too late and
00:00:23 miss it?
00:00:24 Now I can't make it right.
00:00:26 It's a literary reference, do you understand?
00:00:29 No, and I don't want to.
00:00:32 You're from the country of Dickens.
00:00:37 Explain it.
00:00:40 Well you see, there's this character called Kermit the Frog, and he's struggling to make
00:00:47 ends meet with his tiny little family with pigs and frogs, Miss Piggy.
00:00:53 Was Kermit the Scrooge?
00:00:55 No.
00:00:57 I've never seen him up at Christmas Carols.
00:00:59 You've never seen the only Christmas Carol adaptation, the only one.
00:01:05 Not even the original exists anymore, that's the only one.
00:01:08 There is no original, it's simply existed from the beginning of time.
00:01:12 It's older than Christmas itself.
00:01:14 It's got Michael Cain as Scrooge.
00:01:18 People read that story by Dickens about a fanciful world in which holidays exist, and
00:01:26 they were like, this sounds so cool, we should make this real, and then they invented Christmas.
00:01:30 They invented Christmas, and they invented hard working conditions, and curmudgeonly
00:01:35 old men, and ghosts.
00:01:36 They invented labour.
00:01:38 They invented capitalism.
00:01:41 They invented London.
00:01:43 They invented snow, all kinds of great stuff.
00:01:48 The childhood, they invented children.
00:01:54 They even invented the passing of time and death.
00:01:58 Yeah, it was pretty nice.
00:02:00 The ghost of Christmas future in the Muppet Christmas Carol is the scariest version of
00:02:06 death that exists.
00:02:09 I'm curious.
00:02:11 Well, it's not like a visual thing necessarily, it looks like a Grim Reaper, but it's just
00:02:16 like juxtaposed with all the funny Muppets the whole time, and then it's like actually,
00:02:21 you'll die, and no one will care.
00:02:25 Oh my god, yeah, that's one hell of a guy there.
00:02:34 How could they not?
00:02:35 They didn't even have a Muppet.
00:02:36 They didn't even have a Muppet?
00:02:37 Play the guy?
00:02:38 That's crazy.
00:02:39 Yeah, if it was a Muppet, it would be like, ah, like a little death, little time guy.
00:02:44 No, I mean Michael Cain.
00:02:47 Oh, Michael Cain.
00:02:48 I expected that like Kermit would be Scrooge or something.
00:02:52 Well, they always had people intermixing with the Muppets.
00:02:57 I guess so.
00:03:00 I watched Muppet Treasure Island, I think specifically because Jesse said it was the
00:03:04 best movie ever made.
00:03:06 I love that movie as well.
00:03:08 I thought it was pretty good, I guess.
00:03:11 There's a lot of little things like that that sort of made me realize that Jesse was cool.
00:03:17 He liked Tomb Raider, and he likes Muppet Treasure Island, and I was like, oh.
00:03:23 Rare qualities in a person liking those two things.
00:03:27 Liking those specific medias.
00:03:30 Rest in peace, Jesse.
00:03:32 Well, hey, I like stuff that's cool.
00:03:36 I like Homestuck, so, you know, fuck that guy.
00:03:42 Homestuck, Homestuck, actually.
00:03:46 Yeah, you're right.
00:03:50 And I know you're right, but I won't admit it.
00:03:54 The only thing good about Homestuck is the porn people make.
00:03:57 Oh my, oh my God.
00:04:00 Never mind.
00:04:01 No, no, that's not true.
00:04:04 That's not, that's not, not only is it not the only good thing that's not even good or
00:04:08 cool at all.
00:04:09 No, it is.
00:04:10 You shouldn't, you shouldn't say a nasty thing like that.
00:04:18 You fuck.
00:04:19 Look, I just say what is the truth to hell with, with what is acceptable on youtube.com
00:04:26 or any online space.
00:04:29 Pornography is good.
00:04:31 I said it.
00:04:33 Don't you know that what is acceptable on YouTube is the good?
00:04:38 They are one and the same.
00:04:41 Nope.
00:04:42 Oh, shit, I don't have an argument, I just thought it was true, like, shit.
00:04:53 Are we waiting for Tom?
00:04:54 Tom said he was in New York Times.
00:04:57 I assumed he was going to be here.
00:05:01 I mean, I guess we can start without him, I mean, yeah, he knew we were starting.
00:05:08 He knew when we were doing it.
00:05:11 Yee-haw.
00:05:12 So we can give him another minute or two.
00:05:14 Give him, give him the 10 minute grace period and then start, well, we're already like nine
00:05:20 minutes into it.
00:05:21 You know, I mean, if Tom doesn't show up, maybe we should just use this as the episode.
00:05:25 Yeah, maybe.
00:05:27 Maybe we should just say fuck it.
00:05:29 This is, see, that audience, what you just heard was supposed to be, what you, what you
00:05:36 just heard was meant to be bonus content, but we're, so that's a taste of what you'll
00:05:41 get at patreon.com slash the procrastinators.
00:05:45 Eventually when the bonus behind the scenes footage episode is made, it is not made yet,
00:05:50 it's not real, but it will be eventually.
00:05:55 So I don't know.
00:05:59 Sounds pretty cool, right?
00:06:01 It's like a conversation, but again, it's almost, it's almost like a real conversation.
00:06:07 Uh, I, well now, okay, I just, I just glanced.
00:06:13 The reason I got excited a minute ago was I glanced over at, at the ticker.
00:06:19 Bitcoin went up, Bitcoin went up a little bit.
00:06:22 Just a tiny little bit, just a, just a tiny, just a tiny little bit of the amount that
00:06:27 I've lost just today was recouped.
00:06:29 Just a tiny little bit, just a tiny little coin.
00:06:32 Just a tiny, the tiniest little smidgen of crypto value was reclaimed.
00:06:38 Uh, I have had my, my, my crypto is, today's been rough.
00:06:44 Today's been rough because I made terrible decisions.
00:06:47 Uh, I bought in at the worst possible fucking time.
00:06:52 Uh, very, very stupid.
00:06:54 You know, I was like, I was like, you know, it seems so obvious that I shouldn't buy
00:07:02 when the price is high, that probably everyone's not going to buy now when the price is peaking.
00:07:09 So I should buy right now because it'll trick them.
00:07:13 You see, they won't, they won't see it coming.
00:07:18 And that's exactly what I did.
00:07:20 So you bought more?
00:07:22 Have you talked about this on the PCP so far?
00:07:24 I think this is like only happening in the last few days.
00:07:27 I might have briefly mentioned it on the last one because I think I bought
00:07:31 a little bit of Bitcoin before the last episode.
00:07:36 Um, I just, just yesterday, I bought, I sold what I had because I got spooked.
00:07:44 And then I was like, and then it rose again.
00:07:46 And I was like, ah, fuck, I missed, I missed out on that.
00:07:49 Fuck it.
00:07:49 I'm in for the long haul this time.
00:07:51 So I bought a bunch more right as Bitcoin was peaking.
00:07:55 And all day today, it has been slowly trickling down.
00:08:00 And I'm just trying to resist the temptation to be skittish and sell.
00:08:05 Um, because that's what I did last time.
00:08:07 It fucked me up.
00:08:09 All right.
00:08:09 I, it's actually, it's actually gone up.
00:08:11 It's actually gone up, um, like, wait, uh, let me, uh, it's gone up like 200,
00:08:18 it's gone up like 200 points just since this episode began, which is kind of nice.
00:08:22 But anyway, it's, it's like,
00:08:25 part of the, um, the reason I didn't get into Bitcoin when I could have,
00:08:32 because I think I bought some, I told, I told you this earlier,
00:08:36 but I think I'm pretty sure I bought like 44 pounds worth in like 2018 or something.
00:08:42 You, you said, you didn't say, when you said it was 45 pounds, I was like, oh, okay.
00:08:48 Because before that you said, do you think you own a tenth of a Bitcoin?
00:08:52 Yeah, I didn't know how much it was.
00:08:53 Do you know how much a tenth of it?
00:08:54 That's like, that's like $3,000 worth of Bitcoin.
00:08:57 Yeah.
00:08:58 Or it would be now.
00:08:59 At the time it would have been, you know, 600.
00:09:02 Yeah.
00:09:02 I don't know what it was at the time I bought it.
00:09:04 It was like 0.0 or something, 0.0 or something.
00:09:07 Um, but I bought it because it was like all in the news and it was like everyone who had,
00:09:12 who had Bitcoin was like a million.
00:09:14 It is skyrocketing.
00:09:15 It is skyrocketing right now.
00:09:17 It just shot up another like 100 points.
00:09:19 Is it going to the moon?
00:09:21 It's going to the moon.
00:09:22 33, 2, 9, 9.
00:09:25 Oh, it's going back down.
00:09:26 33, 2, 7, 7.
00:09:27 Oh, 33, 2, 9, 1.
00:09:28 See this?
00:09:29 8, 9.
00:09:30 90.
00:09:30 Oh my God.
00:09:31 It's just the sheer vertical green line.
00:09:34 It's like, oh, that's literally money in my pocket.
00:09:38 This is the most fucked up I've ever been.
00:09:41 This is the most addicted to anything I've ever been.
00:09:43 This has completely ruined my life and I'm over.
00:09:45 It's done.
00:09:46 I found the thing that destroys me.
00:09:48 Yeah.
00:09:48 And it's watching the fucking Bitcoin.
00:09:49 It's that this is part of the reason why I didn't really
00:09:52 want to get too much into it because like stonks and shares
00:09:58 and money things that are like money can go up and down
00:10:02 and you don't really do anything.
00:10:03 You just sort of keep track of it and buy and sell.
00:10:06 That whole lifestyle, it's always appeared as though
00:10:11 you can get like a maximum amount of money
00:10:14 from a minimum amount of actual work.
00:10:16 You just need to invest initially and be smart
00:10:19 and learn about all this stuff.
00:10:20 And it's like, cool, that's great.
00:10:23 But my brain doesn't work like that.
00:10:27 And I get too overwhelmed looking at the thing.
00:10:31 I would probably just like, yeah, it would ruin my life.
00:10:36 It would make me just sit here doing nothing
00:10:39 but looking at the thing going up and down
00:10:40 and being sad constantly.
00:10:41 Honestly, that's what I've been doing.
00:10:43 That's what I've been doing today and it's really bad.
00:10:47 Like, it's bad that, oh, I kind of lost money
00:10:51 because I had to pay fees to buy in and oh,
00:10:53 it kind of went down so I lost a little bit in value.
00:10:56 But the real cost of it has been that it has cost me
00:10:59 like a day or two wherein I've been able to do nothing
00:11:03 except look at these fucking numbers.
00:11:05 The way it feels to me is exactly the same as Cookie Clicker
00:11:09 or one of those other idle games where I know
00:11:12 that if I start one of those,
00:11:14 I will get into it for a month, two months,
00:11:18 and I will be so dedicated to getting all the achievements
00:11:22 like from the ground up.
00:11:23 I never like start from a loaded save file.
00:11:25 I always start new, fresh, and I just play
00:11:28 and I'm loving it seeing the numbers go up,
00:11:31 but it really fucks up with everything else
00:11:33 and that's going on.
00:11:34 And this is real life.
00:11:35 So like it's even more damaging if it doesn't go well.
00:11:39 So it's even more stressful.
00:11:41 And I'm like, I don't, even if I could get a lot of money from it,
00:11:44 even if I could somehow find my fucking password and account
00:11:48 because I lost them,
00:11:49 because I didn't pay attention to what they were.
00:11:52 Where did you buy them?
00:11:54 Because like I didn't realize, I didn't know how to get some.
00:11:57 I only got some because PayPal made it
00:12:01 so you can just buy it directly from PayPal.
00:12:04 And I was like, fuck yeah, because they offer me 25 free dollars.
00:12:07 I think like when it was in the news initially
00:12:11 and it was like Bitcoin is now making people millionaires,
00:12:13 I'm like, ah, fuck, I missed the boat.
00:12:15 But maybe it'll keep going up because it was currently going down.
00:12:18 It's literally going to the moon right now.
00:12:22 Right now.
00:12:22 I'm watching.
00:12:23 I can't fucking believe it.
00:12:24 Okay, four context.
00:12:27 Four context.
00:12:28 I bought in last night at like 3.15 a.m.
00:12:34 and the value was about, Bitcoin was valued at about 34.2 thousand dollars per Bitcoin.
00:12:42 And then over the next like, you know, however many hours,
00:12:45 it's it's it's it's sank down gradually to about 32.4.
00:12:52 And then just since this podcast has began,
00:12:55 it is up back to 33.4.
00:12:58 So I don't know, pretty fucking epic, I guess.
00:13:02 Yeah, my value judgment is that even if I can make a lot of money off of it.
00:13:08 It's not worth the cost of your soul.
00:13:10 It's it's not in a moral sense, but just sort of in a like, I know what you mean.
00:13:14 Yeah, it really drains me to think about it too much.
00:13:18 You would have to be.
00:13:19 I would have to be a business boy first and foremost in order to like live like that.
00:13:24 Well, I mean, you get you get into it because you think that it's like, oh,
00:13:28 all I have to do is make like a couple of smart plays and that and then I'll be set.
00:13:33 And then I won't have to do it anymore.
00:13:35 But then, you know, it's never quite that simple.
00:13:37 It's and eventually you maybe you become one of those.
00:13:40 Because you've done it once, then you you feel compelled to do it again.
00:13:44 And then it just it will stay there.
00:13:46 It'll continue.
00:13:47 You can't just stop doing something like that if it works.
00:13:50 I bought the first time I bought in, I just got some just kind of let it sit for a week.
00:13:55 Looked at it and I was like, oh, wow, the price went up pretty good.
00:14:00 And then like I was watching it because the price was going up really fast one day.
00:14:03 I was like, oh my god, this was the day that Bitcoin hit 30 K.
00:14:07 It was it like as soon as it hit 30 K, it like it like shot up another like 10%
00:14:12 in like a couple hours.
00:14:13 It was crazy.
00:14:14 So I watched it do that.
00:14:15 And I was like, holy shit.
00:14:17 And then it started to go down.
00:14:18 And I was like, okay, time to I'm out.
00:14:21 I'm out.
00:14:22 So I sold.
00:14:23 And then I and in all told, I think I made like 100 bucks just from like,
00:14:28 I think I invested like $500 or something in it.
00:14:31 So I made a huge return.
00:14:32 That was like a really good time.
00:14:33 I wish I had invested more.
00:14:35 And I thought that I was like, damn, if only I'd invested more, I would have made.
00:14:39 I could have made so much more.
00:14:41 And then I saw that after I sold, it went down, but then it went up again.
00:14:45 And I was like, I missed out on more.
00:14:47 I missed out on more gains.
00:14:48 I have to be invested.
00:14:50 If I'm not invested, I'm constantly missing out on profits.
00:14:54 And it's literally damned if you do, damned if you don't, because if you're invested
00:14:57 and you could be, you could be losing out because the numbers are going down.
00:15:02 But if at any point you're not invested, you could be missing out if it's going up.
00:15:06 Like you're literally fucked.
00:15:08 I'm fucked forever.
00:15:10 It's a hindsight.
00:15:12 Like it's all predictable, unpredictable, especially with this sort of stuff.
00:15:18 Like normal market shares and stocks are a little more predictable, I assume, than Bitcoin.
00:15:23 Because people always talk about how Bitcoin is insane.
00:15:25 Bitcoin is much more volatile.
00:15:27 It is much more volatile, I think, than a.
00:15:30 Like if you don't pay attention to it every hour, it could plummet until it's completely worthless.
00:15:39 And if you aren't paying attention, if you're not awake during that time,
00:15:42 you might miss out, you might lose all your money.
00:15:44 So it's like, I don't know.
00:15:46 Yeah.
00:15:47 But really, I keep trying to, because I made money a little bit of money the first time,
00:15:54 because I just let it sit.
00:15:55 And really, that's what you want to do.
00:15:57 You want to get some and just let it sit and accrue value over time.
00:16:00 Like buying it and selling it over and over again, because as the market goes up and down,
00:16:05 up and down in little waves, is really stupid and self-defeating.
00:16:08 Because you have to pay fees with every transaction.
00:16:11 And that's not how you're supposed to do it.
00:16:13 You're supposed to buy some and hold some.
00:16:15 So that's what I'm trying to do.
00:16:16 It's been going down all day, but I keep looking at it and I'm like,
00:16:19 just because it's going down right now, doesn't mean it's going to keep going down right now.
00:16:23 I didn't buy it with the idea that I would sell it,
00:16:26 like as soon as I could make a few hundred bucks off it or whatever.
00:16:30 I was like, I'm just going to buy it and I'm just going to hold it and just see what happens.
00:16:34 Yeah.
00:16:35 And but it's, I'm not, I can't stick to it.
00:16:39 It's too difficult.
00:16:40 Yeah.
00:16:40 I'm not trying to like moralize saying it's a bad thing to do.
00:16:43 No, no, no, no.
00:16:43 But it's, you definitely need the right kind of brain wiring to like keep on track of it
00:16:49 and not go insane.
00:16:50 And I don't have that.
00:16:52 I'm sure, I'm sure I will eventually learn to just ignore it
00:16:56 or just check it like once in the morning or whatever.
00:16:59 One of these days I might actually remember where my bitcoins is
00:17:05 and then I will be able to look at it.
00:17:07 You said you got it like before last year, which means that it must be worth much more now than
00:17:13 when you got it.
00:17:14 I have no idea.
00:17:15 I remember getting it at a time when it was plummeting and it just continued to do that.
00:17:20 Lol.
00:17:21 And I was like, well, maybe Bitcoin isn't for me.
00:17:24 And so I forgot all about where I had it and what my password was.
00:17:30 So I've been, when you were talking about it earlier, I was like, maybe I could try and find
00:17:35 that and I couldn't find it.
00:17:37 I didn't know where the hell to start looking.
00:17:40 I remember this thing called Coinbase or something seemed familiar, but I did the thing
00:17:46 where like forgot my password, send an email and I didn't get anything.
00:17:49 So I'm not sure if that was the one.
00:17:52 Honestly, if I was going to do crypto trading, I should probably do it in something like Coinbase
00:17:59 or something like not PayPal, because I'm pretty sure PayPal does not have the best fees.
00:18:04 I'm pretty sure I'm probably paying more in fees with PayPal than I would with some other
00:18:08 more dedicated trading program.
00:18:11 Yeah.
00:18:11 I just Googled something at the time.
00:18:13 I was like, how to get Bitcoin here.
00:18:15 Here's how.
00:18:16 And it was very confusing and I was scared.
00:18:19 Yeah.
00:18:19 And I managed to spend money.
00:18:20 I'm surprised you went through with it because it seems complicated and daunting.
00:18:25 And like if PayPal didn't just give me a button to click to do it, I'm sure I wouldn't have done it.
00:18:30 Yeah.
00:18:30 I read enough that I was like, well, I'm just going to throw like 50 or 40 pounds into this
00:18:38 and expect it to just disappear and never be found ever again.
00:18:41 Because that's not a lot of money.
00:18:42 I can take that on the chin pretty easily.
00:18:46 Yeah.
00:18:46 That was my mentality at least.
00:18:48 Like it's scary, so I won't do much.
00:18:50 And then I was stupid and I forgot all the things.
00:18:53 That's my thinking.
00:18:55 I'm looking at these numbers go up and down.
00:18:58 Like, oh God, that's my real money.
00:19:01 But I invested an amount that I could afford to lose.
00:19:05 And like, okay, worst case scenario is what?
00:19:10 I'm out like a couple hundred dollars.
00:19:12 Like, well, oh well, what a tragedy.
00:19:19 So, I don't know.
00:19:24 But you know, maybe it's like a, I almost feel like it's a cultural thing.
00:19:30 Like I feel like Bitcoin is sort of a cultural institution.
00:19:34 Is maybe something that I am a little bit chuffed to be participating in?
00:19:40 Yeah.
00:19:41 Yeah, I mean, there's no, as far as I understand, there's no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue
00:19:47 to act like this.
00:19:48 It may actually settle over decades into a normal sort of currency that doesn't go
00:19:52 insane like this does.
00:19:55 And then it would just be a normal part of life.
00:19:56 But this is like the advent of Bitcoin in the last few years.
00:20:02 Yeah.
00:20:02 It's pretty cool.
00:20:02 Yeah.
00:20:03 The first time, I said this in the chat before, but the first time it peaked and like it went
00:20:08 from nothing to like whatever, it hit like 10 or 12K or something.
00:20:14 Uh, it seemed like that was seemed like a once in a lifetime event.
00:20:18 But it's much higher now.
00:20:20 I mean, to be fair, that proportionally that rise was much higher because it started out
00:20:25 being worth like a fucking like a dollar per Bitcoin and it went to 10K.
00:20:29 The second time it went from maybe like 6K up to like 30K.
00:20:33 So proportionally, like, yeah, the first one was a much bigger spike.
00:20:37 Even if it's the absolute numbers are higher now.
00:20:40 I really like how the slime coin that I'm currently holding is modeled after the Bitcoin
00:20:48 in the way that it's got the data all over it.
00:20:52 The little circuit board stuff.
00:20:55 It's great.
00:20:55 I spent so, so long taking an image of that like physical Bitcoin representation and like
00:21:04 photo bashing it and then sort of like drawing over the photo bash to make that design.
00:21:10 And then I paid and then I paid someone to make that into a vector.
00:21:15 And then they did kind of a crappy job.
00:21:17 So I had to go in and manually like make adjustments to the vector that that slime
00:21:22 coin is like weeks of work, just like getting it to look right.
00:21:26 I'm honestly shocked that it didn't that like it looks as good as it does physically.
00:21:33 I thought they would fuck it up or like there would be parts of the text that like got mashed
00:21:37 together or something.
00:21:38 But no, it's perfect.
00:21:40 It is.
00:21:41 It's remarkable.
00:21:42 It's so good.
00:21:44 I just ordered 100 more of them actually.
00:21:46 What for fun?
00:21:47 Or are you going to sell them?
00:21:49 Well, the idea is that I'm assuming that they will be sold or or used as promotional items in
00:21:56 some capacity in the future.
00:21:57 I don't know exactly what I'll do with them, but like I almost I didn't quite sell out of the first
00:22:02 hundred I got, but I was close enough that I was like, I should get more of these.
00:22:07 And so I did.
00:22:09 They're not here yet, though.
00:22:11 They're, I don't know, in the mail or whatever.
00:22:14 I like the idea of slime coin being the only physical exclusive cryptocurrency.
00:22:22 Yeah, like it's it's crypto, but every crypto it's contained on these circuit board coins
00:22:28 and you have to physically exchange them.
00:22:33 And they had like a USB port that you could like you could like jack into to extract the data,
00:22:38 but it's been like sanded off and you can't do that anymore.
00:22:41 The data is in there, but it's it's totally inaccessible forever.
00:22:47 It's all dumped up with slime.
00:22:49 That's right.
00:22:50 That's right.
00:22:56 Yeah, money.
00:22:59 I fucking love money.
00:23:01 Not me.
00:23:02 Sad to say, but it's true.
00:23:04 But I only love money so much because capitalism means that I have to.
00:23:08 It's not my fault.
00:23:10 I'm a product of the system I was raised in.
00:23:13 True that.
00:23:15 Patreon.com slash Benzane.
00:23:17 If you want to make me happy by giving me more money.
00:23:20 Patreon.com slash the procrastinators to make both of us happy and less like like split the
00:23:26 split it down.
00:23:27 That's true.
00:23:28 That's that's true and valid.
00:23:31 Very, very.
00:23:32 I could also say my own Patreon, but I haven't been making anything.
00:23:34 So I feel like that's stupid.
00:23:36 I have been I revealed.
00:23:40 I've been hinting at Twitter on Twitter about the thing I've been working on.
00:23:44 Oh, you haven't said it.
00:23:45 You said it in a Patreon Ben thing that I still haven't listened to yet.
00:23:51 I talked.
00:23:52 I talked about it in the Patreon Q&A.
00:23:55 I talked about what it was and I said in that Q&A that I will probably be posting like patrons only
00:24:01 like updates and like little previews and stuff at pieces of it as they get done.
00:24:09 Actually, I was just working on a little bit for it before we started recording and thinking like,
00:24:15 okay, when I'm done with this, I will, you know, maybe arrange it into into something
00:24:19 that will make it for a nice little update thing.
00:24:24 Just show show those fucking guys over there.
00:24:27 What's what's going on?
00:24:29 Uh, I was pretty I was pretty drunk when I recorded that, uh, F Q&A this month.
00:24:37 I didn't think that I was at the time, but thinking back on it, I was like, you know,
00:24:41 I kind of don't remember recording it very well.
00:24:44 So I think maybe I was drunk.
00:24:47 Lol.
00:24:47 And I just didn't realize.
00:24:50 Yeah.
00:24:51 Yeah.
00:24:52 You know, so who knows how these things happen.
00:24:56 You know, you're talking about your mysterious construction.
00:24:59 My mysterious construction.
00:25:01 I kind of have a mysterious construction and the same reason I'm not going to talk about it is
00:25:06 the same reason you have is that if I talk about it, the idea will be gone out of my head and it
00:25:11 will have less in like incentive or less like less gusto.
00:25:16 It'll drain my gusto and then I won't be making it as hard anymore.
00:25:20 Yep.
00:25:22 Yeah, that's that's that's a little thing.
00:25:23 So, so I guess we're at a standstill.
00:25:29 We're at a standstill.
00:25:29 So I guess neither of us can talk about anything.
00:25:34 So that's the episode, everybody.
00:25:37 Well, hey, Ben.
00:25:38 Happy New Year.
00:25:40 That's right.
00:25:41 Happy New Year.
00:25:41 Did you get it?
00:25:42 Did you get a big drunk at the Happy New Year time?
00:25:45 No, I didn't do anything for New Year's.
00:25:48 I actually I got drunk the next day after one of my roommates had bought a bunch of
00:25:53 whiskey and then none of us did anything.
00:25:56 And I just went to bed early on New Year's.
00:25:58 I didn't stay up for midnight because fuck it.
00:26:01 And I woke up the next day and the whiskey was just out on the table and I just drank some.
00:26:05 And then I went and I recorded the Q&A.
00:26:11 So no, I didn't do anything for New Year's.
00:26:14 Did you?
00:26:17 I guess, well, every year for the past like three years, I've been doing like a
00:26:23 live stream on Gibbon Gaming for like, oh, it's going to be like the fireworks will
00:26:28 go off and it'll be Happy New Year during the stream.
00:26:31 And like everyone does that.
00:26:32 But since I'm in a different time zone, it'll be earlier for a lot of people.
00:26:38 And, you know, that was fun.
00:26:40 Played 24 of the video game.
00:26:43 And why?
00:26:44 I don't know.
00:26:45 Because it's the countdown?
00:26:47 No, it was just like my brother got me a bunch of shitty PS2
00:26:52 weird games that like just cheap.
00:26:56 And we like playing them and seeing how strange they are.
00:26:59 24 was actually pretty fun and good.
00:27:02 But it got too hard near the end of the stream.
00:27:06 Is it a shooter?
00:27:07 What is it?
00:27:08 You know 24 of the TV show?
00:27:11 Yeah, with what's the name?
00:27:14 Kiefer Sutherland, yeah.
00:27:16 It's basically like a series season of 24 where there's things in different
00:27:22 boxes moving around and you're Jack Bauer or you're this agent or that agent.
00:27:26 And you've got to kill people and jump and shoot and do the hacking and drive real fast.
00:27:34 And it's like, it's actually quite good for a PS2 game at least.
00:27:41 It's quite a latent development.
00:27:43 It was an all right stream.
00:27:44 It was quite a few funny moments.
00:27:46 But during that stream, after like a really funny moment, I thought to myself,
00:27:52 that thing that I was thinking of doing, going back over Gibbon Gaming to see.
00:27:57 Do I know what it is or have you not told me?
00:28:01 The thing you were thinking of doing.
00:28:02 Do I know what it is?
00:28:04 Yeah, I talked about it on the last heckles for shackles live stream, I think.
00:28:08 We were talking about going back over like our own streams and like maybe potentially
00:28:13 paying somebody to get like highlights of stuff.
00:28:16 And I was thinking, I should at least check to see how possible it is for myself to even do that.
00:28:25 So I look back, there's like 556 hours average sort of like a ballpark estimate.
00:28:34 You have 500 hours.
00:28:36 500 something out of stream over the last three or four years.
00:28:41 Oh my God.
00:28:42 Not actually that much.
00:28:44 I say, oh my God, but I wonder maybe I might have a lot.
00:28:47 I would do really long streams once in a while.
00:28:49 Maybe I don't know.
00:28:50 That makes me wonder how much I've got saved up from the past.
00:28:54 A few moments later.
00:28:56 Eleazar, cut that out.
00:28:57 Cut out all the way.
00:28:58 What did you do?
00:28:59 What did you do?
00:29:02 His dinner arrived.
00:29:04 I'm not going to eat it now.
00:29:06 Oh, what was I saying?
00:29:08 You were saying the fight.
00:29:10 Okay, Eleazar, cut me rambling there.
00:29:12 That was, I don't know what I was talking about.
00:29:14 You were saying about there were 550 hours of streams.
00:29:17 Yeah, yeah.
00:29:18 So there's like 500 something hours of streams.
00:29:22 And if I played that back, it would be like 225 something,
00:29:26 a bunch of hours of rewatching my shitty streams at double speed.
00:29:33 And I was like, you know, that's like a full month of work if I watched my own streams
00:29:40 for eight hours a day.
00:29:41 Yeah.
00:29:42 And that's like, that seems like a fucking lot.
00:29:45 But maybe I could just check like skim through a few episodes, a few of the streams.
00:29:51 I go back to some of them and they all have this terrible noise on them.
00:29:55 And I never noticed before because I just remember them having been like a thing.
00:29:59 I never really go back and re-listen to them and they've all got like noise.
00:30:03 Well, like fan noise or something?
00:30:04 Yeah, fan noise or just like background noise that's just annoying.
00:30:08 And I'm like, oh God, I'll have to like download these, get rid of the noise and then look through it.
00:30:15 And it's, I just, I just realized that my given gaming streams suck.
00:30:19 And like you really have to be there.
00:30:20 And you really have to be in the room with me playing the game if you want to enjoy it.
00:30:24 And I understand why nobody watches them.
00:30:27 That's that's just what streams are.
00:30:31 Yeah.
00:30:33 It's just like that.
00:30:34 I think most people don't really care about a little bit of fan noise.
00:30:38 No, yeah, I suppose not.
00:30:40 But like it's, it's, it's annoying me that like I had never noticed and nobody has ever pointed it out
00:30:45 all that time.
00:30:48 But that's on me really for not listening back at all.
00:30:54 Given gaming sucks.
00:30:55 I thought it was okay.
00:30:56 I thought it was like cool or something.
00:31:00 Nothing's cool, Gib.
00:31:02 That's your fucking problem is you think
00:31:05 that's a thing that things can be.
00:31:08 I am going to flip my fucking shit.
00:31:11 I will, here's my promise.
00:31:13 I will flip shit if I'm watching the ticker.
00:31:16 If Bitcoin hits, if Bitcoin hits 34K while we're on stream, I will, I will punch my fucking monitor.
00:31:23 I will crack it.
00:31:24 I will punch my Cintiq and smash it with a thousand pieces for your, no, I won't do that.
00:31:30 But it'll be fucking epic.
00:31:31 And I, and I will let you know.
00:31:33 Did you hear any of that?
00:31:34 Yeah, yeah.
00:31:36 Yeah, you'll, you'll, you'll punch your Cintiq and destroy it.
00:31:39 I'll, I'll literally kill myself.
00:31:41 Oh, don't do that.
00:31:42 Then all the money will go.
00:31:44 Yeah, you're right.
00:31:45 Yeah, you'll go to your first one.
00:31:47 Just Elon Musk will just inherit it by birth, right?
00:31:50 I assume.
00:31:55 The other thing, the other thing that's keeping me going, the other thing that's keeping me from
00:31:59 suicide is that Bitcoin has been trickling down today.
00:32:03 However, I also got some Ethereum and the Ethereum went up and did really well.
00:32:09 So I lost with the Bitcoin, but I gained some of that back with the Ethereum.
00:32:13 So it's kind of like, I'm a little down, but I'm not so far down.
00:32:16 I'm like, I'm good.
00:32:17 I'm just, I has on the prize.
00:32:19 I has on the prize, Ben.
00:32:20 Why is it called Ethereum?
00:32:22 That's like, like a World of Warcraft magical crystal gem currency.
00:32:27 It sounds, its logo is a fucking Final Fantasy jewel gem.
00:32:33 What a fucking nerd made that.
00:32:35 It looks fucking sick.
00:32:36 Yeah.
00:32:37 I don't, I don't know.
00:32:40 There's a little blurb that PayPal lets you read about each of the crypto.
00:32:44 And it's like, oh, Bitcoin, Bitcoin pioneered blockchain technology,
00:32:50 meaning the secured, secure data is very secure and can't be hacked.
00:32:54 And I'm like, okay, all right.
00:32:56 And then it's like, Ethereum showed what else was possible in the realm of cryptocurrency.
00:33:01 What makes Ethereum special is that it's used in the development of apps.
00:33:05 And I'm like, what the fuck does that mean?
00:33:08 What, what do you mean it's used in the, and it's like, oh, Ether,
00:33:11 Ether is the actual currency.
00:33:13 Think of Ethereum more as an engine with Ether being the fuel that it run.
00:33:16 Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
00:33:19 What, what the fuck are you talking about?
00:33:22 I really feel like alien technology that, that I need a Vsauce video to explain cryptocurrency.
00:33:28 I need like basic baby shit to like, like none of the, none of the fundamental things of like,
00:33:35 you can make coins with computers that just mine like, what?
00:33:38 Like, I don't get it.
00:33:41 I think I understand the idea.
00:33:43 Do they mine at night?
00:33:44 Is that the thing?
00:33:46 The blockchain.
00:33:47 I don't, I mean, I obviously don't know how it works,
00:33:49 but I think I understand the idea of the blockchain is basically just like a peer-to-peer
00:33:54 network, sort of like, what's the word?
00:33:58 What's that thing, the way that you get illegal movies and stuff?
00:34:03 Right, it's some kind of like peer-to-peer network and like,
00:34:07 you can't, I don't know, I read a little thing and it's like, it's secure because to like,
00:34:11 hack it at all, you would have to hack like every, every computer that runs it simultaneously or
00:34:17 something. It's like, okay, so it's this, the reason why Bitcoin is, is a real thing is because
00:34:23 this blockchain is very secure and that means that a Bitcoin is not able to be like spoofed
00:34:32 or duplicated because of how secure it exists.
00:34:35 Does it exist in many places at once? Is that the idea?
00:34:39 What I believe a Bitcoin is, is, okay, I watched a video about this a while back and I'm like,
00:34:46 a Bitcoin is just data, but it's like a specific piece of data. I think, I think it's like a string
00:34:53 of numbers that are the solution to some arbitrary equation and there are like a set of these equations
00:35:01 or something like that and what each, each Bitcoin is the solution to like the next equation in the
00:35:08 set, but it's like a very complicated one and it needs like a huge amount of processing power
00:35:13 to arrive at each one and that's how what mining Bitcoin is. It's like, it discovers these solutions
00:35:20 through just computing.
00:35:22 So like a daisy chain, a daisy chain of, of computer like equations that is linear?
00:35:28 Can you find the original Bitcoin?
00:35:32 I would assume so. I think so, probably, yeah.
00:35:36 What if, what if everybody turned their computers off? What would happen then?
00:35:40 I think, then I think, well, then Bitcoin would probably cease to exist in the same way that
00:35:48 the universe would not exist if we weren't around to experience it.
00:35:53 I hope that I'm making a complete fool of myself, by the way, and everyone in the comments is like,
00:35:58 Ben, you don't understand. The first thing about the blockchain, Ben, you're not a blockhead like
00:36:02 me, Ben, you don't know shit, you're a moron, you're a rude, I hope.
00:36:06 This is the right way to be, is you make a fool of yourself online about something that you don't
00:36:12 know and then you rely on people saying, oh, actually, and then now you know. It's much easier than school.
00:36:19 It's, it's better and cheaper than school and you don't get coronavirus and it's not,
00:36:26 it's remote learning, but it's in the good way because, and I don't, and the best part is,
00:36:31 I don't even have to learn it because I don't have to read the comments if I don't want to.
00:36:35 I can choose my own custom reality. I can choose to acknowledge or not acknowledge
00:36:41 whatever facts the commenters choose to present me with. It's mine, the universe is mine to command,
00:36:47 to control. Yep. Yep.
00:36:53 So, oh, speaking of, speaking of another graph that is constantly going to the moon right now
00:37:01 is the coronavirus in the UK. Oh, it's, oh, America too, America too. Massachusetts really,
00:37:09 it's really gross and I don't like looking at it. It's so fucking bad. If you google Covid UK and
00:37:17 you get like the statistics, the Google statistics up and it's like new cases, the little blip at the
00:37:23 like March of last year is like, it's, it's now a little blip, it just goes up a bit and then
00:37:29 December, November and now January is like fucking crazy. Okay. This is worse than I thought.
00:37:38 It's so upsetting. I mean, I'm scared, Ben. What do I do? Okay. I mean, if you look at the one for
00:37:47 the US, the US is similar, although I see that the UK in particular has like a really dramatic
00:37:55 shoot up just in the last like couple weeks. So that's a fucking, that's a bummer. Yep.
00:38:02 I mean, the US also has like, since like late October, it has just, you know, the waves in
00:38:09 March and July are like pretty fucking small. Yeah, I'm pretty concerned about it too, but you
00:38:17 know, I'm very glad my dad, my dad, I think is qualified for a phase one vaccination,
00:38:26 which is good because he works in nursing homes. So,
00:38:29 Oh, well, there you go. That's very good. So he's probably going to get vaccinated pretty soon,
00:38:35 which is good because he was the one I was most worried about just in terms of him, you know,
00:38:42 because of that, because of his vocation. Yeah, I'm not so much scared of dying myself. It's just
00:38:49 like, yeah, if I don't want to give my dad COVID, and he's the only one who actually has to go out
00:38:56 because he works in construction, sometimes he needs to leave. Oh, God, yeah. Yeah, it's pretty
00:39:02 bad. And so fucking bad. It's, I'm crossing my fingers, but like the whole like new strain of
00:39:10 the virus that's super, super catchable. It's not nice. I don't like it. Is that what it's
00:39:19 deal? It's super catchable? Yeah, I forget the terms that are like smart people use them.
00:39:26 High transmission rate? High transmission rate, like it can easily pass from one person to the
00:39:30 other much more than the previous variant did. And so it's like you don't need to,
00:39:36 you know, before it was like you wear your mask and you'll basically be all right. As long as you
00:39:41 don't like jump into like, you know, you don't as long as you don't sniff somebody's like nose or
00:39:46 whatever. But now I feel I feel like if I go outside and I breathe the air, somebody nearby
00:39:53 buys breath, breathed, then it could happen. I don't know exactly how it works. I just I'm,
00:39:59 I'm scared. I'm scared. And I just really is fucking with me every day. I don't like it.
00:40:06 I'm trying to distract myself by thinking happy thoughts and playing video games,
00:40:10 but like I'm trying also to not do that and instead work and get stuff done.
00:40:16 Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I'm, I'm, I was disappointed to see that it seems like
00:40:27 vaccinations won't be available to the general population before like, April or so. So,
00:40:35 I want one. I want one real bad.
00:40:40 I want one as well. I don't mind waiting personally because
00:40:46 as a younger person, it I'm not as much at risk and I don't need to get out so much. And I would
00:40:52 like to know a bit more about the longevity of the vaccine based on how long it's been around
00:40:58 and people, you know, once once they start reporting how it's been for the people who
00:41:03 got it initially, then I'll be more like confident in taking it.
00:41:08 Yeah, for sure. I agree. I am a little bit glad that I don't have to be the first one to
00:41:16 fucking take it because like, who knows? Although, I mean, it seems like all indications are that
00:41:22 it works pretty well and doesn't really carry much risk of anything. But we'll see, you know,
00:41:30 there'll be like a whole bunch of people to get it first and we can find out for sure, LaMau.
00:41:34 I mean, I don't think there's going to be like a risk of the vaccine itself and also like,
00:41:39 how long does it last and how effective is it at doing the thing it's supposed to do?
00:41:45 Do you need to take them once every two months? I don't know.
00:41:49 It seemed like, okay, you get, it lasts longer than that. I think it might last like
00:41:58 up to a year or something. Well, you know what, I'm pulling figures out my ass. I don't even remember.
00:42:04 But you have to get two. You have to get like vaccinated once and then you have to go back
00:42:07 a month later for a second one. And like, you're only like semi-vaccinated in the time between.
00:42:16 They were saying on BBC News that the first one is like, the Oxford one they're talking about,
00:42:21 is like the first jab is like 95. So it's pretty, pretty effective. And then the next one, or maybe
00:42:29 it was like 91. And then the next one bumps that up to like 98, 99. So the second one is not as
00:42:37 important apparently, but it is important if you want big immunity. I do want big immunity.
00:42:45 Yes, I would like that very much, actually. SS tier immunity, please.
00:42:53 I'll take the good immunity. Keep that shit immunity for the birds.
00:43:02 Do you imagine trying to vaccinate a bird? Your needle would just go right through it.
00:43:08 Because it just pierced it like a sword. It just explode like in shred.
00:43:17 Wait, it's time. I got to check on my Bitcoin. It's down a little bit.
00:43:23 Is this going to be like a PCP arc? Been checking Bitcoin and going, that's right.
00:43:28 Oh, it's 33, 33, 55. Oh, 33, 60. Oh, 33, 570. Oh, no. 33, 570. Oh, 33, 6. Okay.
00:43:39 35, 577, 65, 544, 39. Remember, I bought in at 34.2. 33.2. So that's what I really want.
00:43:54 You could probably do a live stream of you just looking at the thing and saying the numbers out
00:44:01 loud. Yeah, like the live stream, it just shows the graph. I'm just like, oh, 33, 612. Oh, 604.
00:44:09 Oh, 33, 604. Going once. Okay, 613, 619. This is the best fucking game I've ever played.
00:44:18 I can't believe how grossing this is. It would be like a job for people who are blind
00:44:26 and they want to get into Bitcoin, they would listen to your stream to get the numbers.
00:44:31 It's just me like saying them. Saying them and occasionally going,
00:44:38 okay, no, no, no, it's fine. Okay, 35. Okay, 36. Okay, 110. Okay.
00:44:43 They can tell this from my tone of voice how excited they should be. Oh my god.
00:44:52 No, this was a mistake. Becoming a crypto guy, big mistake. This is the last mistake I'll
00:44:58 ever make. This is it for me. I'm toast. I'm toast after this. There's no coming back from this,
00:45:03 not for me. I just don't have what it takes. I feel like funny mistakes are pretty good, actually.
00:45:09 Well, I hope you think it's funny. I hope you think it's funny when I'm in the poor house.
00:45:20 Like you're a hundred or two hundred dollars having lost. That's right.
00:45:26 And I can't afford the rich house that you have now. That's right. That's right. I'll have to go to,
00:45:33 I'll have to be a Bitcoin debt peonage. I'll have to, I don't know, hammer license plates or whatever
00:45:43 it is you do. I'll have to hammer license plates to put on Elon Musk's Teslas.
00:45:49 I thought you were about to say testicles. I don't know why.
00:45:52 That's right. That's right. No, that's what I was going to say, but I censored myself
00:45:56 because I knew that wouldn't play on YouTube. That would get us. That would get us. That would get
00:46:01 us demonetized. I ran out of gummy shit. I ran out of my good, I ran out of my good gummy shit.
00:46:14 Yeah. I was, I was off keto. I was doing sugar gummies, but now I'm back on keto.
00:46:21 So I need to use the gummy, the keto stuff, the isomaltoligosaccharide or the IMO.
00:46:27 And I just use the last of it and I don't have anymore and I'm sad because that's so,
00:46:35 that's stuff so good. The last batch I made with it came out so good. I made little watermelon,
00:46:42 like little half cubes. I didn't make worms. I made little cubes and they were perfect. It was
00:46:47 like the best ones I'd ever made. They were like chewy, sticky. They were, they tasted just right.
00:46:57 They had the perfect consistency and I can't do it again because I don't have the stuff anymore
00:47:03 because nobody, nobody sells it. No, no American company sells it and the Chinese
00:47:09 distributors will only sell it in like units of a metric ton and I'm not going to drop like
00:47:14 thousands of dollars on a metric ton of this fucking tapioca fiber.
00:47:19 So what is it? Is there a way to like science experiment your way to making it yourself?
00:47:25 Or is it like the raw materials themselves are still also too difficult to get?
00:47:30 I feel like it's probably extracted in some sort of chemical process that I would need like industrial
00:47:37 equipment to replicate. I would have to, I would have to like receive shipments of
00:47:43 whatever fucking Jerusalem artichokes or whatever and, and run them through some sort of like chemical
00:47:50 bath is probably in a series of chemical treatments in order to separate the fiber powder from the
00:47:57 fruit. So I don't think I can do that. But I can dream.
00:48:05 No, no. I've been watching a YouTuber called Niall Red who does chemistry videos. They seem like
00:48:13 they do a lot of fun things where they're like Niall Red Niall Red and I L E Red.
00:48:20 And it's just sort of like basic, not basic chemistry. It's quite
00:48:25 complex and they use a lot of know how. I know this. I know this guy. I saw a video.
00:48:31 I saw a video of him trying to take the caffeine out of Red Bull.
00:48:38 Yes, to make caffeine free Red Bull. He's made a lot of really interesting things where
00:48:44 honestly, my favorite part is just seeing the chemical processes he goes through
00:48:49 and him just dryly explaining that I did this and then I did that and then I waited until it was
00:48:54 the right temperature and then I took it up and I did this and I filtered it off and I did that
00:48:58 and now I have this and it's like, it's just going through the process in a very like non-charismatic
00:49:04 way, which is really, I don't know. I love, I love listening to him.
00:49:11 Non-charismatic. Yeah, I like. Charisma sucks. I love videos that suck. Charisma is just like,
00:49:20 hey guys, video and I'm like, shut up, shut up. Don't ever say that to me again.
00:49:30 You're all so smart and handsome and you're talking to me like and you're on stage or like,
00:49:36 shut up, just be boring and shitty. I like that more.
00:49:42 If you make me like you, it makes me hate you. It's true.
00:49:47 Yeah, I know. I agree. I unironically agree. I hate it. I hate it when,
00:49:54 I don't know, there's a, there's, I think there's a, there's a, an uncanny valley. There's a very
00:50:02 steep uncanny valley where someone can be almost, when someone can do something in an almost charismatic
00:50:08 way and maybe they get close, but there's something a little off and it just makes me hate them.
00:50:13 It makes me, it makes me distrustful. Like you're manipulating me. I hate you.
00:50:17 Yeah. It's sort of a very subtle way. Not like, oh, this guy's clearly fake. It's just sort of like,
00:50:23 like a very vague feeling that I can't really like accuse anyone of being anything in particular.
00:50:29 I just, I just, I like it when there's just a straightforward series of events explained
00:50:36 by a person. They don't need to be completely devoid of, of like comedy or, or heart.
00:50:44 I don't know. There's just, maybe it's just some sort of, some sort of something
00:50:48 that I dislike about like the biggest YouTubers. Like I can't imagine, I can't imagine like
00:50:55 having a conversation with Matt Pat. You know? Oh my God. Oh my God.
00:51:00 Not that I would really want to have a conversation with like a YouTuber, like ew,
00:51:05 ew, gross, but like, I don't know. That's not really the metric I was going for. I'm trying
00:51:10 to explain it, but I can't because I'm stupid. Anyway, Nalred's really good. He made a video
00:51:18 recently where he turned plastic gloves into grape soda flavoring and drank it.
00:51:25 Because there is a chemical in a specific kind of like surgical glove that is very
00:51:33 similar to the same chemical used to make grape soda flavoring. And so he chemically changed
00:51:40 the thing using acids and bases and all these sorts of processes. And it was like, I just,
00:51:48 I just love being along for the ride on those strange journeys. Like what if I could do this?
00:51:53 I tried it and here's what happened. And it worked. I'm looking at that video and watching
00:51:59 him just make like weird brown dirt looking powder out of stuff. Yeah. And it looks gross, but damn.
00:52:10 I wonder how it tastes. I guess it must taste all right. Is this, he goes into the hole like,
00:52:16 Is he a trans guy? Is he a trans guy? Not to my knowledge.
00:52:24 Okay. I mean, not to assume. He seems quite young. He looks like quite a young guy.
00:52:34 Like he's, I don't know, some sort of science prodigy or like was really good at it in high
00:52:42 school and then went straight into doing this sort of thing. He's been making videos for a long
00:52:46 time. Has he? He looks, I think he looks like he's not actually that young, but he has like
00:52:53 a youthful face for his age. Yeah, something like that. Because it surprised me. It surprised me
00:52:59 to see him like, I mean, even his voice is a little high pitch and I saw his face for the
00:53:05 first time once. I was like, that can't be the person who's making all these incredible science
00:53:09 videos. That doesn't make any sense. How could somebody so young this are good? He looks like an
00:53:14 idiot. No, no, I didn't mean that. But I did. Secretly.
00:53:24 Yeah. I've seen, I've seen a few of these. The caffeine one was the one I remember. I've probably
00:53:33 seen one or two of these. Man, I love YouTube. I love YouTube videos. Man, a new new summoning
00:53:47 salt new summoning salt came out this past week. Yeah, boy, just I just watched that. Oh,
00:53:56 his videos are great, but they just sort of, something about them is different from the
00:54:03 original few that he made, where they seem like extremely long and I get kind of tired.
00:54:10 There's a, there's a, there's a thing about the funniest thing in a summoning salt video is when
00:54:16 like, he'll, he'll get to a point where like, this guy had finally achieved the ultimate,
00:54:23 the ultimate run. He got all the good luck and he did all the good tech and everyone was blown away
00:54:30 and the record was, was, was set and it would stand for years, except no, because the very next day,
00:54:38 this fucking guy showed up and he'll introduce some new guy. He did it in this past one and he's
00:54:44 done it before and he'll show like the guys, whoever is being introduced, the guys like YouTube
00:54:49 Avatar and their, their screen name and it'll be like some guy and it'll be like so and so,
00:54:56 900 subscribers. It's like, I don't know. It's like, it's, it's, he's, he's describing them as
00:55:05 of if it's big fucking like heavyweight, they're like a celebrity that we should be like, oh,
00:55:08 shit, it's this guy, but it's like someone who you've never heard of and nobody's ever heard of them
00:55:14 and this is the only thing that you would ever know them for.
00:55:18 I mean, I think it's just because watching speedrunners is such a time-intensive thing,
00:55:24 keeping up with them. I think most people who watch speedrunners actively are speedrunners
00:55:29 themselves. So it's a very small community of like hardcore people and then us, like laymen
00:55:35 on the sidelines are just like, oh, what was that? More like laymen. It's just like, huh,
00:55:41 what's that going on there? Is that a record? Cool. They did it real quick, didn't they?
00:55:47 Wow. Video games. I like video games.
00:55:50 But I would, I would never like watch a speedrunner.
00:55:54 Oh, like watching over and over again. Yeah.
00:55:56 No, God, no. God, can you imagine?
00:56:00 You'd need to, I mean, at first you'd need to know the run that they're doing and why it's
00:56:05 difficult. I can't, I can't imagine getting into speedrunning without also
00:56:10 doing speedrunning. Do you know what I mean? Like watching it.
00:56:14 Yeah. The most, the most dedicated viewers are probably. Speaking of speedrunning,
00:56:22 I watched another video that I watched, I think this morning or last night or somewhere in between.
00:56:28 There's a guy called Carl Jobst and he released, he made a video asking about dream and whether
00:56:36 dream cheated or not. Do you know about this whole dream thing?
00:56:40 I think, I think I've seen the video you're talking about.
00:56:43 It was really good. And I, I, I, I've been one of these, I've been one of those people who is just
00:56:52 like sort of bewildered by this suddenly seeing everyone talking about this guy dream
00:56:59 all over Twitter and stuff. And I guess now I understand what it was. It's very frustrating
00:57:06 because after watching that video, I, I, I understand, I feel like I understand completely
00:57:12 what happened and why and how he cheated and why it seems like he definitely did cheat,
00:57:18 but I also completely understand how people could like fail to get how it was that he did
00:57:27 cheat and like how they know. I don't know, like he gives some examples, he shows examples on screen
00:57:34 of people saying like, uh, oh, but, or I don't know, because it, because it wasn't like he,
00:57:40 it wasn't one particular run of Minecraft that was cheated. It was like the game itself was
00:57:45 altered to give him better odds of getting a particular thing to happen. It was very sneaky,
00:57:50 very sneaky and you know, sort of impossible to prove unless they go to all the, they do all this
00:57:57 fucking, you know, running trillions and trillions of like statistical
00:58:02 models of it to like see if they can get luck like that and they can, it's, and it's impossible.
00:58:07 I don't know, it was pretty, pretty neat. I thought it was a neat thing that happened.
00:58:12 It is pretty like, like I could imagine he cheated based on the evidence that was provided,
00:58:19 but there's still wiggle room to say like, like, no, no, but like it's the fact that there's like,
00:58:28 it's not proven like concrete. There's wiggle, I feel like there's wiggle room for him
00:58:36 to be a weasel about it and be disingenuous about it in a way that people will believe because
00:58:42 they don't understand. Right. Because they haven't had it like explained numerically to them,
00:58:47 because what it really is is like a numbers question of like, are these numbers possible?
00:58:51 No. But if you like sort of divert from that question, you're like, oh, but the run itself
00:58:56 is totally possible. And it's like, yes, that's true, but that's not the point.
00:59:01 But you can, you can make it about that if you want to, which, you know, he has every reason to do.
00:59:06 Yeah. LaMau. So I don't know. Now I know. Now I know what the deal with that is.
00:59:14 I did see, I guess we're just talking about YouTube videos we've seen recently.
00:59:20 I guess so. I mean, what else do we fucking talk about?
00:59:23 Well, I could talk about have been depressed.
00:59:26 Lol. Did you see my Money Spenders podcast? You said you listened to it.
00:59:32 I did. I did listen to it. I did. You've been clean in that room for like a long time now.
00:59:39 Well, I mean, it's pretty clean now. But like, I feel like it's I feel like it's been months
00:59:45 that you've been saying like you were going to clean that room. You know, I mean, it was the
00:59:51 whole of December, basically. Like I said, I would do it. I said I would do it at the end of
00:59:57 November. And then it was, I don't know. Maybe maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm smoking crack. But I feel
01:00:03 like I feel like multiple times in like previous ones, you've mentioned that as a thing that you
01:00:09 were going to do. I don't know. I probably mentioned it multiple times as in I talked about it on
01:00:16 November's Money Spenders podcast and on the PCP maybe once or twice.
01:00:20 Maybe, maybe, maybe that could be it. In any event. Yeah, I've it's it's weird and annoying.
01:00:30 I seem to have like the big like, like everything sucks. And I'm the worst guy ever.
01:00:37 Time to die in the morning when I'm waking up. And then I'm like, oh, yeah, whatever. And I'm
01:00:44 okay. And I've been doing that. My mysterious construction has been underway. And then during
01:00:52 the end of the day, I'm like, Oh, but you know what? I really am the worst guy. And I should die.
01:00:57 And all that stuff. And I go to bed and wake up and it's fine in the middle of the day. And it's
01:01:02 like, well, I mean, I guess I guess I guess it's working. I guess something's working here.
01:01:07 I can't wait to tell my therapist will be useless about these things.
01:01:12 Is your therapist useless?
01:01:14 It's it's just early days right now. I've did they they asked me to like write down what I do
01:01:22 during the day. And then they'll start formulating a plan of like reform your thoughts and think
01:01:29 positively instead of negatively. It's the sort of stuff you hear and it's like, yeah,
01:01:35 that sounds easy. Just do something else. Just have a different thought instead of the one you're
01:01:40 having. I really wish there was like an obvious way to change it. But there isn't. You just need to
01:01:48 figure out how to trick yourself into thinking the other thing.
01:01:52 Okay, hold that thought. 33, 3, 3, 7, 5, 4, 33, 7, 5, 4. We're getting there. We're going to make it.
01:02:02 Nice. Oh God, 33, 7, 5, 0, 4, 7, 34. No. Okay, I can't look. Keep going. Keep going.
01:02:11 Um, I don't know. There was this, this Wiser app, W-Y-S-A, which is supposed to be like
01:02:22 therapy, but like an AI. And I'm like, well, I guess I'll do fucking anything. I'll do the
01:02:29 the the cream therapy, but an AI. Does it like prompt you with questions to think about or something?
01:02:36 Or is it like a chat bot? Yeah, you chat to it and you say things and it's like,
01:02:41 how are you feeling? Oh, I see. Here's something that maybe like you could think about, maybe try
01:02:47 doing this. And here's some examples of thinking patterns that lead to depression. And it's like,
01:02:52 it's kind of helpful hearing it like written out based on what I'm telling it. It's not that
01:02:57 very good though, and it repeats itself a little. But I think just having that has been all right
01:03:05 the past few days. It sounds like something like that is good and that it can just like
01:03:12 prompt you to be thinking in the right way. And like, you don't need a person to
01:03:19 basically remind you the same, the same things over and over again, right? Yeah, a lot of the
01:03:24 difficulty is to keep your mind on the right mindset or whatever. Is when you slip back into
01:03:30 the bad mindset, it's difficult to use your compromised brain to do anything,
01:03:40 you know? Because it's already thinking in the wrong way. And you need someone to tell you,
01:03:46 actually, this is a logical fallacy and you need to think differently to maximize everything.
01:03:54 And the ways I'm thinking are like, oh, I see that is this sort of problem that I keep having.
01:04:01 I get it. Like having just knowledge of thinking patterns is useful.
01:04:05 I have the same, I find the same thing about like at night time, my mood often
01:04:11 markedly gets worse at night. And I feel the most depressed at those times. And I don't know,
01:04:20 my usual solution to that is, well, better get on a regular sleep schedule. So I'm going to sleep
01:04:30 before I start feeling like that. That is, that's what is helpful to me about that particular issue.
01:04:42 A lot of the things that are like the simple solutions to these problems, like get some
01:04:46 exercise, have a regular sleep schedule, change your place, change your environment regularly,
01:04:55 change your diaper, stinky. I mean, at the moment, it's, oh, shut up, don't say the word,
01:05:06 you can imply it, we can't say it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, YouTube, I'm sorry, don't demonetize us.
01:05:11 I'm already losing so much. Oh my god, 33, 6, 5, 0. Jesus Christ. I'm already lost everything,
01:05:21 YouTube, please don't take this from me. What was I saying? I don't know. Oh, the basic things like,
01:05:30 yeah, like get exercise, change in scenery, like environment, if you stay in the same room for
01:05:37 all day, every day, it makes you go insane, which is a problem right now because that's what they're
01:05:44 expecting people to do in the lockdown situation. And I'm like, gee whiz, gee willikers, I can't
01:05:52 really, I can't really solve that problem. So I got to escape into the VR world or fucking play
01:05:59 Minecraft or just think, just think about all the, I need a video game analysis video to say,
01:06:06 this is the most immersive game ever. And I'm like, I'll play, I'll buy it, I'll play it.
01:06:10 I want to be immersed, I want to pretend I'm somewhere else. Yeah. But yeah, all I can do
01:06:17 right now is exercise on like a bike, like a stationary bike. That's a pretty good one.
01:06:25 I'm lucky I have that. That is pretty good. If I had a stationary bike, I might use it.
01:06:32 Or a running machine. Those are all right as well.
01:06:36 You mean a treadmill?
01:06:37 Treadmill, yes.
01:06:41 A running machine is like those robots that they make.
01:06:46 You know, the ones that are going to be killing us soon. The Boston Dynamics ones.
01:06:50 They're right in my backyard. They're right in my backyard, kid. They're coming for me.
01:06:54 Could you send a little drone over to take a sneak peek?
01:06:57 I can't, I'm afraid that I can't tell them what to do. Nobody can anymore.
01:07:06 I saw that they were doing like, oh, the Boston Dynamics robots are doing a little dance now.
01:07:12 They've learned how to dance. And it's like making them, making them appeal to the human brain as
01:07:18 like not a danger, not a threat. And then they don't fall for it. It's the same. It's literally
01:07:24 the same as the Pete Buttigieg Jants. He's trying to convince you that he's a real human being,
01:07:28 and you shouldn't be afraid of him. Don't fall for it.
01:07:31 And, you know, the spot or dog, whatever the Boston Dynamics dog is,
01:07:36 he's got like the little crane head with the clamp. And he's like coming in and then he just,
01:07:40 oh, he pulls out a Glock and he's just such fucking going to town.
01:07:46 He loves it. He loves it.
01:07:49 You know, all we need to do is to develop guns that robots can't use with their
01:07:57 mitten hands, and we'll be all right. We've got a developed weaponry that can only be activated by
01:08:06 sincere creativity, and we're just like, artists will be the most powerful people.
01:08:11 No, you just, you have to, no, wait, it's literally endless war. You have to enter a
01:08:14 capture every time you fucking fire a gun is literally that we fucking pioneered it.
01:08:22 Ah, you have to solve it. It's on the side of the gun as a little touchscreen.
01:08:26 You have to solve the capture before it can fire. Robots can't use it. Robots neutralized.
01:08:31 Dude, robot uprisings is going to be so fun when we have to, we get to shoot people and we don't
01:08:35 have to feel bad about it. Oh, because they're robots? Yeah.
01:08:40 There's a, there was like a, there's a VR game. There's a VR is an Oculus game that I think is
01:08:50 about shooting robots that seemed like was very well reviewed. And I think I at some point planned
01:08:58 to get it, but I didn't. And I don't remember what it was called anymore. And I, you know,
01:09:05 and I have a problem where I feel like my Oculus Rift went heavily underutilized because the only
01:09:09 thing I ever used it for was super hot and a little bit of Beat Saber that one time, not Beat
01:09:17 Saber, whatever the VR one is where you slice the cubes. Yeah, that's Beat Saber. Oh, okay. Yeah,
01:09:24 Beat Saber. Dur, didn't get, I feel like I didn't get my money's worth out of that freaking thing.
01:09:31 And it's such a fucking hassle to set up. It wasn't your money though. It was the
01:09:35 vaporous Kickstarter money. Oh yeah, I guess that's true. You gotta give the people what they want.
01:09:44 I never set up, back when I used to stream, I used to, I said that I was going to set up like
01:09:51 VR chat. That I was gonna do like VR chat. Or I said I was thinking about doing it, but I wanted
01:09:57 to have it like, I wanted to set it up so that I could see the Twitch chat on like in the headset,
01:10:04 like displayed in front of me so I could read what people were saying while I was VR chatting.
01:10:08 And that seemed like so, I tried to do it and I, I couldn't figure it out. One guy,
01:10:14 one guy like kept messaging me like, reminded me like, here, this is how you do it. Here's
01:10:18 some software that lets you how to do it. And I kept saying like, okay, I'll check it out,
01:10:21 I'll check it out. I never did it. I never checked it out. I let everyone down. I failed.
01:10:27 What you eating? I'm eating beef bourguignon.
01:10:36 What? You made that up. Beef bourguignon. Beef, that's not real. Beef bourguignon and rice.
01:10:44 You're a fucking liar. Google it, if you can. How do you, I can't, that's not a real word.
01:10:51 Beef bourguignon. It's French. Burger. Oh God, it's, oh God, it's real.
01:10:58 Burger. It's basically, it's, it's basically just like a stew. It's just beef. It is. It's a beef
01:11:04 and onion stew, but it's very nice. Sure. Whatever. Whatever. Let me, let me complain. Let me complain
01:11:13 about something. I'm actually very upset about this. I said before that fat Ben is back, right?
01:11:21 And then I found this out right before I went to go see my parents for the holidays
01:11:26 because I weighed myself. Now, when I weighed myself, I was like, oh wow, I'm almost back up to
01:11:34 like the weight that I was in my heaviest, right? At my heaviest before, like around at radcon four,
01:11:40 no, sorry, radcon three, I was, I was about 195. I was almost 200 pounds.
01:11:46 This time, I weighed myself and I was about the same. I was like 190 something and I was like,
01:11:55 oh shit, damn. Good thing I didn't hit 200 though. Time to clean up my act, right? So,
01:12:01 I'm like, okay, I'm not, I, I'm glad I caught myself before I could hit 200. So, you know,
01:12:07 I go back on strict keto. I go back on very strict keto. I start eating cauliflower. I'm,
01:12:12 I'm, I'm eating chicken. I'm eating, I'm eating, you know, I'm cutting back on all the stuff.
01:12:18 I'm going back to strict keto diet. Well, I weighed myself yesterday and I fucking gained
01:12:24 like eight pounds and I'm like 200 and something now and I'm so angry. I'm so angry to report that
01:12:32 because I've been keto for like a week now. And usually when you start keto, you shed a bunch
01:12:37 of weight at the beginning because your fucking glycogen depletes. What the fuck happened? I don't
01:12:44 understand. I don't understand and I'm fucking mad about it. And I'm taking it out on you.
01:12:50 Fuck you. Okay. I don't really feel like I've been attacked, but good job. Well, darn.
01:12:58 I fucked it up then. Feel sorry for me right now. Okay. There, there.
01:13:06 Okay. Don't fucking go overboard. That's enough. Stop.
01:13:13 I'm upset. I'm upset, but it's okay. Just gotta, just gotta stick to the plan.
01:13:19 Just gotta trust the plan where we go one, we go all. Follow, follow, follow. Q is the thing.
01:13:27 That's what I was missing there. It was a joke. Do you think it might be fate to be fat, Ben?
01:13:33 Because it's like similar to letters to fate and fate.
01:13:36 Horrible. Yeah, you know, that actually makes a lot of sense.
01:13:42 Fate, Ben. I think that this is just destiny. It doesn't even have anything to do with my diet.
01:13:49 It's just destiny. Just how fat, how, how, what weight do the stars want me to be?
01:13:54 You get 3,000 pounds.
01:13:59 Wait, hold on. Eleazar, cut this part. I gotta mute. I gotta, I gotta be back. I'll be back.
01:14:08 Okay, I'm back. Hey, what's up? Hey, what are we talking about? Hey, what did I miss?
01:14:12 You missed the Gib song. The Gib is a lone song. That's part of the bonus episode.
01:14:17 Oh, yeah. Boy, I should head over to patreon.com slash the procrastinators
01:14:25 for an only $5. Make it possible to in the future hear that in the, in the,
01:14:32 in the, the, the outtakes bonus content episode that will exist one day, I'm sure.
01:14:38 We surely, surely we must be getting close. Surely we must be approaching the point where
01:14:43 we have enough to make that. And when we do all this foreshadowing will, will pay off in splendid
01:14:49 fashion. People can try to piece together what, what clips each episode is from. Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
01:14:56 yeah. Ooh, it's a puzzle and a podcast. You have to work for your entertainment.
01:15:06 That's, I mean, isn't that, isn't that the best kind though? Isn't that when you feel
01:15:11 the strongest connection to a work? Yeah, I suppose. When it demands something from you.
01:15:17 Yeah, you know, if you, if you just listen to a podcast and you didn't, you don't like put
01:15:21 it the work in, you know, you didn't, what was the copypasta? Like you didn't improve,
01:15:29 you didn't learn nothing. Oh, you cheated not only the game, but yourself. But yourself, yeah.
01:15:33 Hell yeah. Hell yeah. You cheated not only the podcast, but yourself.
01:15:40 Oh no. We're stalled out. We're stalled out at 33, 5, 7, 35, 83, 35, 99, 5, 99. Can I get 600? No.
01:15:52 Oh, there it is. 613, 613. 610. Holy shit. It's too much. Best update quite quickly.
01:16:01 Yeah, like every few seconds it does. Maybe it's just your heart rate that you're looking at going
01:16:06 up and down. If that were true, then whenever I looked at it, it would skyrocket. Earlier today,
01:16:14 I opened up the thing with the ticker on it and I looked at it and there's a glance at it and I
01:16:21 saw like, okay, it's been holding pretty stable. But as soon as I looked at it, it just plummeted.
01:16:26 It just like went through the floor. I was like, no, I have to not look. I can't look at it.
01:16:32 And I looked away and I closed the window and it worked because now it's going to the moon.
01:16:38 Wait, wait, wait. I got to update you. I got to give you live updates. I know you crave them.
01:16:45 Here's where we're at now. As you see, it's progressed. Oh, so yeah. It's been wibbly wobbling
01:16:54 around that same bit, but it's still pretty high up there. It's just kind of been chilling.
01:17:00 Just kind of been chilling. Well, wait, wait, I'll show you where it started for me.
01:17:09 This is for context. For context. For context there. That was where it was when I bought it.
01:17:18 So as you see, it was a harrowing day of it just tanking. And then just when we started the recording
01:17:24 this, it was like, oh, maybe things aren't so bad. Oh, wow. You bought it pretty high up.
01:17:30 Yeah. That was the second time you bought. That was the second time I bought it. And it was a
01:17:34 mistake. No, no, no. It seems pretty stupid. But then like, I mean, this is, let me show you the
01:17:44 last day or two, or this is the last week or so. And you will see that it's even worse
01:17:54 it's even more foolish than it appears at first glance around here is where it is on screen
01:18:05 in the grand scheme of things. Oh, so, so, you know, obviously that's that's the time to buy.
01:18:16 What if that's the like peak for like next whole year? It might it literally could be.
01:18:22 It literally could be that like, that Bitcoin will never ever be this high again. And this was
01:18:28 the highest it will ever go in the history of the universe. That's funny. It's been,
01:18:35 it's been, I mean, okay, just for just for one more, just for one more piece of context, what is
01:18:42 the what is the here's here's the entire history. Here's the entire history of Bitcoin.
01:18:50 And it shows like where we're at now relative to where it started. And
01:18:57 you know, so we're up there, we're up there on fucking mounts, mounts, whatever.
01:19:02 2011, I think it started and then 2018 or 2017. Big boy. Now, yeah, wow, twice almost
01:19:14 like, like 2020 end of 2017 beginning of 2018 was when it was like, because you know,
01:19:21 over on the left there, it's worth like fucking a couple dollars. And then it explodes up to like
01:19:26 almost 20k. And that's when like fucking freaks like Elon Musk all made like a shit ton of money
01:19:32 selling at the at the peak or whatever. Yeah. And then it kind of went down. And then,
01:19:40 in the ensuing years, I remember I'm thinking like, dang, you know, that was the time that was
01:19:46 that if I was ever, if Bitcoin was ever going to make, you know, fortunes, it would have been then,
01:19:52 you know, surely it's not going to happen again. Well, here we are. Oh, well, I mean, yeah,
01:19:59 what are you gonna do? It's not really going to make fortunes from from because it didn't
01:20:03 start so low, you couldn't have bought it. Yeah. And then it increased. It's not it's not such a
01:20:08 dramatic. Yeah, you're not going to go from owning like a few hundred dollars to owning like
01:20:13 hundreds of thousands of dollars, or millions or whatever. You're gonna, you're gonna go from
01:20:19 you're gonna go from having a few million in Bitcoin to having like a few tens of million in
01:20:25 Bitcoin. If you have a single Bitcoin, I mean, it is a big increase. That's that's an interesting
01:20:31 graph. I like looking at graphs. Pretty cool, right? Numbers, they really, they really make you
01:20:37 think really make you really get the get the the juices flowing.
01:20:45 All right. Oh, I love bogging down the podcast with Bitcoin talk. This is my new thing. This is
01:20:52 the new arc. This is the start of the Bitcoin. This is the Bitcoin podcast now. Oh, no, do I have
01:20:58 to learn about something? No, well, yes, but the person who doesn't know about Bitcoin. Yeah,
01:21:05 you can explain things to you can be the guy who's always like, but Ben, what does that mean?
01:21:11 And I'll you're like the audience surrogate who doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.
01:21:15 And I could be like, aha, you fool, you rube. Well, I'll explain it to you. So yeah, and then
01:21:21 and then you'll make a fool of yourself. The chat will the chat will like correct you over and over
01:21:27 again. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It'll be like a comedy routine where you're like the straight man
01:21:32 audience surrogate and I'm like the the pompous dullard who thinks he knows and and that's where
01:21:40 in the comedy emanates when that's whence the comedy emanates. I believe that's how comedy works.
01:21:48 You know, I've ever since ever since I became the trans as they say, um, Lamel, all these like
01:21:57 terms that are like male gendered that I used to think, oh, you know, they're like
01:22:04 gender neutral, like layman and straight man. And it's like, it feels different now thinking
01:22:11 about it. Like, I don't want to change the word because that sounds weird, because I know it as
01:22:15 straight man. Straight man. Straight man. I like that. Straight man. I like that a lot. It's the
01:22:24 first thing I think of like replacing man with man, but it's kind of hard to notice. So I don't know.
01:22:31 When I when I posted that picture from the Radcon calendar, uh, uh, suggesting that Tom would be
01:22:37 the next to transition, I thought it was really funny when people said people suggested like
01:22:44 can't wait for Tom Tom boy Oliver. And I thought that was really funny. Because like a Tom a Tom
01:22:52 boy is a girl. So to make Tom into a girl, you make his name boy. I don't, I don't know.
01:22:59 Hilarious. It was hilarious. I loved when I saw comedy, comedy genius. And then in that lineup,
01:23:07 Munchie would be next. So, uh, no, no, Nate, Nate after Tom. Oh, oh yeah, Nate. Nate than Munchie,
01:23:14 then you. Then me. Wait, are we missing someone? No.
01:23:20 It's only the, it's only the, it's only the, um, oh yeah. Yeah, you're right. Five of us, six of us.
01:23:26 Only the five of us. Man, I look so fucking good with my goth makeup and my, uh, and my wig.
01:23:33 That wig was sick. Lending me that wig, lending me that wig was the only good thing May ever did
01:23:40 in her entire life.
01:23:44 Lama. Uh, uh, good times. Good times at Radcom for, um,
01:23:52 Oh, I've got a, I've got a cool new thing to, to announce. So it's not really an announcement,
01:23:57 but I'll be the judge of that. I never knew. Because I didn't know what Webkin's was. I didn't
01:24:03 know the hypocrite, the hippo, the plush was a Webkin. I still don't know what Webkin's are.
01:24:10 I know that they are, it's like, you know, beanie babies from, from the time of when that was the
01:24:16 thing, it feels a little bit similar to that where they're like collectible animals of some
01:24:23 brand. Uh, okay. So it's, it's a specific, it's a specific like company. It's a specific line of
01:24:30 plushes. Yeah. Well, yeah. They have like different, different, I don't know, seasons of
01:24:36 plushes. Like not all the plushes look exactly the same style. The one I had was like sort of
01:24:41 anatomically correct hippo as opposed to a cartoon hippo, which is the other things that
01:24:46 Yeah, hippo does not look like he's part of like a, a line. He just looks like a hippo.
01:24:52 Yeah. He, he look, he's like a National Geographic Webkin's crossover. I guess, I don't know.
01:24:57 Um, but Webkin's is a digital video game sort of like Club Penguin, MMO, uh,
01:25:06 early internet stuff where you get your pet and you, you have them, you have them digitally and you
01:25:13 can have, they have a room, they have a house they had, they can play mini-game, you play mini-games
01:25:19 to get coins that you can spend on furniture and outfits. And it's, it's Club Penguin, but with
01:25:26 plushes that you buy. So is it like Club Penguin, but with like a Skylanders sort of element wherein
01:25:34 you buy like a physical toy and then you scan it into the game?
01:25:40 Um, I suppose, I think you can get like, like pets in the, the, the, the website Webkin's.
01:25:50 I only played it for a long time. I thought, I thought that's what you did. I, I thought you
01:25:53 like scanned hippo in and yeah, yeah, I scanned, I scanned hippo in and I scanned hippo in and hippo
01:25:59 now exists digitally on my account. Um, I never played this when I was young. So I, I had like
01:26:04 Kazi tell me all about it and, and I played like a bunch of their funny flash game things they have.
01:26:11 Uh, Rest in Peace flash, by the way, that's gone. It's all dead.
01:26:16 Oh yeah, that just died. I haven't checked, I, I haven't felt the need to check to see if things
01:26:24 are dead, but I had to check because in, in, in the, the patron Q&A for, uh, I, I brought up, um,
01:26:33 CCC city, you know what that is. I've, I've talked about that, right? Uh, is that Sonichu?
01:26:40 No, what is that? No, it's not quick bill. Oh, no, it's the opposite of quick bill. No, CCC city,
01:26:48 CCC city is a bit like a, like a, a flash. I think they were originally in flash video
01:26:55 animation series by this guy called Vinnie Veritas on Newgrounds and I used to really like them.
01:27:01 I remember you saying those names. I, I forget what it's about.
01:27:05 It's not really about anything. It's just like animations that take place in this
01:27:10 like sort of fantasy urban location called CCC city. Um, and, uh, uh, anyway, I went to Newgrounds
01:27:18 to see if they had survived the death of flash and yes, they did. Um, they're just, they're just
01:27:24 uploaded as videos now. I guess they've been converted somehow, which is nice. Uh, I, I wonder if
01:27:34 everything is, I wonder if like, I mean videos are just worse than the way because they weren't
01:27:40 designed like on all the flash games, of course, I don't know what they're going to do. Maybe there's,
01:27:46 I've, I've seen HTML games. Maybe they've been transformed into that some people, but they would
01:27:51 have been, they would have had to like actively like the owners of those games would have had to
01:27:56 actively preserve them. Anything that was just left on, I think doesn't work anymore.
01:28:01 And that sucks. But I'm on, I guess that, I guess that might be like, this must, this must not have been,
01:28:08 huh? This must not have been flash. I'm on the Newgrounds page for triacnid and it still works. So
01:28:14 that must not have been flash, I guess. Wow. I mean, I know nothing really about it. I just
01:28:19 have heard that flash is dying and everything will be gone. I'm like, Oh, that's sad.
01:28:24 Wow, that's sad. Yeesh. I didn't really do anything about it.
01:28:31 I know that there were, I mean, I know there were efforts to preserve stuff. And I,
01:28:39 I don't know, I, it'll be, it'll be sad. It'll be sad when I start hearing about specific things
01:28:46 that were lost. It's like, Oh, this doesn't exist anymore because flash is dead. I mean,
01:28:51 even if flash is dead, one could hypothetically still like get, download something and then like
01:29:00 run flash locally on their computer and like convert it like that. Like, like just because
01:29:06 flash is dead doesn't mean that things that were in flash can no longer be converted to.
01:29:11 Yeah, I feel like it's possible to, to, it's just all of the things that are not easy to get a hold
01:29:17 of or are like abandoned. They will, you can't just, I don't know, you'd have to put in the effort
01:29:24 to make it work again. And if it was, I mean, I don't know what Club Penguin rewritten was like
01:29:33 when Disney destroyed Club Penguin because they're evil bastards and I can't ever forgive them.
01:29:39 Wait, who did? Who killed it? Disney. They bought Club Penguin quite early on,
01:29:44 I think. And, and it was a Disney property for a while, but then they deleted it. They got rid of
01:29:50 it so that they could push their new Club Penguin mobile app game, which was a 3D version of Club
01:29:56 Penguin on mobile. And it was fucking terrible. It was filled with micro transactions and bullshit.
01:30:02 Nobody played it. So they realized there was a failed investment and they canceled the new thing.
01:30:09 So now Club Penguin doesn't exist, except in this illegal version of Club Penguin that fans
01:30:14 recreated. And I assume that still uses Flash, so maybe that is in trouble. They probably figured
01:30:22 it out there. That's just like, that's just like when Cuomo said that you'll get a million dollar
01:30:29 fine if you vaccinate anyone who's not, who's not supposed to get vaccinated. It's the same.
01:30:36 Capitalism. What? Capitalism ruins everything. Vaccinations, Club Penguin, it's all part of the
01:30:42 system. That was the thing, I guess. I don't follow. Quick. You know, you know, because, because,
01:30:50 I don't know, the Disney bought it and they had it and they were like, oh, we can't make money off
01:30:54 it. So we'll throw it in the trash. Nobody gets it. And Cuomo, Cuomo is like, nah, nah, only the
01:31:01 fucking, only the fucking, the essential people get the, get the, get the vaccine.
01:31:06 Get the Club Penguin. Anyone that doesn't get, anyone that doesn't get vaccinated,
01:31:08 no, you can't use it on someone else. Throw it in the trash. If it doesn't, you can't,
01:31:12 you can't, you can't find the priority guidelines. Oh, I didn't know about that. That's stupid.
01:31:17 That's what I'm hearing. That's what I'm hearing is that these, it's like, you're not allowed to use
01:31:21 it except on people who are, who are set for it. And like, apparently this is going to cause some
01:31:27 sort of, some sort of supply glut, which might lead to doses of the vaccine just getting discarded
01:31:36 in trash because they expire after a while. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
01:31:42 This is what seems, this is what seems to be what is potentially the result of this new order
01:31:49 of Cuomos to not vaccinate. They'll be, they'll get fucking, you'll get fucking murdered. You need
01:31:54 to lose all your fucking practicing licenses if you do, if you fuck around, if you fuck around
01:31:59 with this and vaccinate anyone who's not supposed to get it. Capitalism. Stupid. The primary goal
01:32:07 should be very clear. Vaccinate as many people as possible. Prioritize the people who need it most.
01:32:13 If you have it lying around, give it to people. That's so simple. Fuck, like, yeah, like literally,
01:32:19 like, if you, if you've got them, literally just give them to fucking anyone. And it's, it's, yeah.
01:32:26 I mean, for sure, I agree. I mean, I'm sure. Did they do it? So, so that the people who, like,
01:32:34 I don't know, they don't trust the doctors to not use it on themselves and to their families first,
01:32:39 they, like, you have to do it on these specific people, otherwise we'll kill you. Yeah. Because
01:32:44 we don't trust you to use it responsibly otherwise. I think that's the idea, yeah.
01:32:52 But, you know, if, if, if doses get, get discarded because of that, like, fuck that.
01:32:57 Yeah. Fuck that. It's much worse. Yeah. Pretty cringe, pretty cringe. But anyway,
01:33:06 I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about Club Penguin. I want to hear more about
01:33:10 that and Webkin. Dude, Club Penguin's so fucking good. You get your penguin and you club them
01:33:17 over the head. I always wanted, I always wanted to play Ragnarok online. Do you ever,
01:33:24 you ever play that? You ever see that? I feel like I saw a review of Ragnarok online.
01:33:32 Ragnarok online looked like, I don't even, I never even saw anyone play it. I
01:33:39 literally just saw, like, the sprites from it and I saw some screenshots from it and I just
01:33:44 really, really wanted to play it. But, like, I couldn't and I, I don't know why. Like, I tried
01:33:50 to sign up online and they couldn't, maybe my internet wasn't good enough or I didn't have this,
01:33:53 the specs for it or something. And I don't even know what it was. I just remember a burning desire
01:33:59 in my young child heart to play Ragnarok online because it had cool looking anime,
01:34:06 it had, like, Gaia online sprites but, like, less stupid looking and I think you could, like,
01:34:12 fight monsters. It's on Steam. I guess you can play it. Is it? Wait, wait. I just googled it and
01:34:20 it looks like it's on Steam. Oh, wait. Oh. No. At the request of the publisher, Ragnarok online
01:34:27 is no longer available for sale on Steam. What? Did they turn off the servers or something?
01:34:38 I see an article that says Ragnarok online goes free to play. Okay, well, there's a Ragnarok
01:34:44 online mobile that I think is a remake or something. It might be a new thing. I don't
01:34:52 know when this is from. This could be years old for all I know. This is from October 17th, 2019.
01:34:59 Okay, a new Android version of the well-known MMORPG for PC is coming West this year after
01:35:04 experiencing enormous success in Asian countries. Okay, so they're remaking it basically and that's
01:35:09 probably why they took it off Steam, the old version. I mean, I'm sure it was crap. I'm sure
01:35:16 it was dog shit fucking grindfest Korean bullshit. Just like, uh, just like, uh, what's the other one?
01:35:22 Everything. MapleStory. You ever play MapleStory? Is that the side-scrolling one?
01:35:29 Yeah. Yeah, it reminds me of when I did the 24-hour stream and I played MapleStory for like half of it.
01:35:36 I remember a bit of it. That was so cool. This game sucks so fucking bad. MapleStory is like,
01:35:42 it's like, oh, what was that game we played for RFCK? Oh, uh, yeah, I know. It's, um,
01:35:48 and it's the one by the, by the, the, the Diary of a Wimpy Kid guy.
01:35:51 Oh, was it from that guy? PopTropica? Yeah, literally the guy who made Diary of a Wimpy Kid
01:35:58 also made PopTropica. That's really funny. It's so fucking weird. I love shitty games. They're so great.
01:36:07 I had never heard of PopTropica before Munchie told me about it, but when I played it,
01:36:11 I was just like, oh my God, this is literally just MapleStory, but without like cool anime combat.
01:36:18 It's the same fucking game. Or, or I guess a, a, a MapleStory is just PopTropica, but with anime.
01:36:26 But I'm pretty sure MapleStory came first. So I think it's really around. I mean, I was playing,
01:36:32 I played MapleStory in my freshman year of college, which was 2000 and wait, MapleStory is 2003?
01:36:41 Yeah. Well, I'm just looking at Google that says that.
01:36:45 Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. How old was I in 2003? Like 15?
01:36:51 Like 58? Like, like, uh, like 80? Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's over. It's over for me.
01:36:58 Wait, um, PopTropica come out.
01:37:01 I don't know. It was, it was very surreal, very surreal experience. Uh, uh, I don't know.
01:37:12 Is initial release date September 2007. Oh yeah. Yeah. Developer, the Jeff Kinney group.
01:37:19 Jeff Kinney is the, um, that fucking guy. Wimpy Kid guy.
01:37:24 Meh. When you're, when you're a fucking rich, powerful dude, you literally just make everything.
01:37:32 Uh, you literally just, just, just bend culture to your will. Diary of a, of a, of a, of a oligarch.
01:37:41 More like diarrhea of a Wimpy Kid.
01:37:44 Is they made, they, anyone made that joke before? Diary, uh, of a Simpy Kid.
01:37:52 Diarrhea. Um, no, no. I'm sorry, but no. Uh, what were we, what were we fucking talking about?
01:38:03 I don't know. Old games. Club Penguin. Old, old games. Flash dead. Flash dead, gone.
01:38:09 Flash dead, uh, uh, Hippo, Webkinz.
01:38:15 I didn't really have anything else to say on the Webkinz front. It was just like,
01:38:17 I'd never played Webkinz before and now Hippo exists digitally. And if anyone likes Webkinz,
01:38:23 that's cool. I, I ran around for a bit and I, uh, I, I gave her like some funny shoes.
01:38:31 I, I went to the school and during recess, I dug in the sandpit and I found a full like
01:38:36 football outfit and I put that on. Can I visit Hippo online? Uh, can you give me a URL
01:38:45 to go to her house? I think it's possible. And vandalize it. We could do like a thing
01:38:51 where Ben St. comes to Hippo Critt's house. Agreed. Uh, I'm ready. I'm ready when you are.
01:39:03 Just give me a time. Just give me time and place. You can have a, we can have a socially
01:39:08 distanced date. Socially. Oh yeah, me and Kazi were on there, right? Kazi has like a
01:39:14 horse that looks just like a little bit and I- What on Webkinz? On Webkinz. She, she was a big-
01:39:19 Is little bit, is little bit a Webkinz? No, but she has something that looks just like him.
01:39:26 Just a generic horse thing. And it's not called little bit. So it's from before. She played Webkinz
01:39:32 a lot. And we were, we were going around trying to harass some of the weird, some of the kids,
01:39:38 some of the youngsters, would basically be- So the children. Basically-
01:39:41 Okay, so you and Kazi were going around harassing children. Okay, got it.
01:39:44 But nobody paid attention because I think they were just min-maxing playing the game.
01:39:48 They were going into this one room. Min-maxing. They were gooning out.
01:39:53 Yeah, literally gooning, like goon central over here. They, they just walked into this room
01:39:59 and they clicked on a thing and then they disappeared. And we clicked on it and it was like,
01:40:03 every day you can come back here and get a thing. So we figured that these players were like,
01:40:09 like non-socially playing Webkinz to maximize and get all of the stuff every day that they can.
01:40:15 Doing their daily quests. And it was really funny because these little funny animals,
01:40:19 they'd moving across the screen and me and Kazi, because you can't like type in Webkinz.
01:40:23 You can only say stock phrases. And we just, we just surrounded them when we could and we just
01:40:29 said, I feel bad. Wait, really? Oh god. You can say like, you can say I feel good and then people
01:40:39 can respond in kind by clicking on your like speech bubble. And so we were just being like,
01:40:45 I feel mad. I feel mad surrounding them. And it was very strange, but I don't think any of them
01:40:51 paid attention. It was just really funny for a while. So Webkin bandits. If you want to join
01:40:58 my gang, you should, you should have streamed that honestly. That sounds like some performance
01:41:04 art. Shit. I could stream it. It could happen again. Arrasing kids in Webkinz. Damn, we're just,
01:41:14 they're just trying to do their dailies, bro. It's so funny when we realize that. Like, why?
01:41:20 I mean, I guess any game can be min-max and gooned, but it's just funny. Because it's,
01:41:24 I mean, they're so, they're so cute. What do you do dailies for? Like,
01:41:28 to buy like clothes or something? Or like furniture for a house? You get money and you
01:41:33 can buy furniture and clothing and different houses and special, I don't know, access to mini
01:41:42 games or membership or whatever. Do you think, do you think it's actually kids? I would imagine
01:41:49 that it's people who play it as kids who just still play it. Because nostalgia. I don't know how
01:41:55 big Webkinz is though. It could still be like, there weren't that many people around. There's like
01:42:00 one or two. So I don't know. No idea. Something, I don't know, something about, something about
01:42:09 that makes me really sad. I don't know whether it's sadder in my mind to imagine a child doing that
01:42:16 or an adult doing it out of nostalgia. They both kind of bug me and get under my skin in different
01:42:22 ways. And I don't like thinking about either one. I think it- It- Perfectly honest. It makes me feel
01:42:27 a little sad, the idea that they're, they're playing it alone, presumably and min-maxing by
01:42:33 themselves. Because like the whole point of those things is like, you have your cute little animal,
01:42:38 you dress them up, and then you show off like, look what, look what I have. I got shiny shoes,
01:42:43 ha-ha. And it's like, if there's no one around, like that was what depressed me about playing
01:42:49 War the Warcraft back when I was doing that. I was like, man, I feel compelled to do all
01:42:55 these quests and get all these numbers go up. But at the end of the day, all these incredible
01:42:59 achievements I have and all this cool gear and mounts and titles, nobody is paying attention
01:43:06 to anyone. They're all just focused on themselves and the community's soul is completely gone.
01:43:14 Sucks. Yeah. Yeah.
01:43:19 Feels like living in the city where everyone's walking past each other. You can't even stop
01:43:23 and say, hello, how are you doing? You always got somewhere to be. You can.
01:43:28 You can. You can stop and say, hello, how are you doing? But then they say, get the fuck away
01:43:32 from me, freak. And then they throw you to the ground. They say, they say, they say, get on the
01:43:36 ground. Get on the ground so you're easier to hit. Yeah. Bummer. Sad but true.
01:43:51 I don't know. Video games, man. Video games. Yes, that is such a thing as that.
01:44:00 I got a really strange game this week. I just bought it on a whim because it looked interesting.
01:44:08 But let me tell you about it. It's called Neute, N-O-I-T-A. Oh, yeah. Do you know it?
01:44:16 I know it's based on a specific German 985 stream moment that is quite infamous, but yeah, keep going.
01:44:23 Oh, really? Okay. Because I've never heard of it. It's not related to the game that moment. It's just
01:44:28 a really funny German moment. Wait, what is it? I'm curious. Well, he was playing the game and he
01:44:36 started betting with his audience about community subs where you give subs to whoever's in chat and
01:44:44 it just randomly distributes them. So he gives subscriptions. He was betting with this chat
01:44:50 that he could do certain things in the game, hitting an enemy or not dying in this next room.
01:44:57 And if I do it or if I don't do it, I'll give 15 community subs. And then he did it and he was
01:45:03 like, haha. And then chat was like, double or nothing, double or nothing. And then the bets
01:45:08 kept getting higher until he was like, all right, if I don't want, if I don't, if I miss the next
01:45:16 shot out of this gun, then I have to give like 500,000 community subs. It was getting ridiculous.
01:45:26 And predictably, he was right next to the enemy. He shot right past it. He missed. It was the
01:45:33 funniest moment. And now, German 985 owes chat like two something 0.5 billion dollars in community
01:45:43 subs. And so much stuff about what is happening in his current streams is like, he'll do something
01:45:51 that chat wants him to do if they they shave off like a few million dollars from the debt.
01:45:57 And it's a running joke. It's really funny. So funny. That's really funny. Okay, wow. I'm surprised.
01:46:03 I'm surprised that the Noida was related to that because I've again, I've never heard anyone mention
01:46:10 this game. But I saw it and I was like, oh, wow, that looks really fucking neat. Is it like a well
01:46:15 known game? I'm not sure. I think it just played it because it was cool and Indian out recently.
01:46:22 Well, for the for the for the audience, I'll say that it's it's like, it's a rogue like sort of,
01:46:28 it's like, it's like, you know, randomly generated dungeons. But like the way the world is generated
01:46:33 is it's based on like, those like sand physics sort of games, you know what I'm talking about,
01:46:40 the ones where you put fucking sand in a in a on the screen, and then you like drop other
01:46:44 kinds of sand on top of it. And they like pile on each other and you can make like gas particles
01:46:50 and stuff and they float around. Like it's like physics based like that. And there's yeah. And
01:46:57 it's really fucking neat. But it's really fucking hard. And I have honestly not made very much
01:47:03 headway at all. I think I got to like the third stage like one time and I have no idea how many
01:47:08 stages there are. I found a I found like a couple of secrets in like, I found a secret boss in the
01:47:14 first stage, but it was like so far beyond my ability to deal with. I got obliterated. It's
01:47:20 hard. It's a hard game. But I really like that like, I really like playing with those like,
01:47:26 particle physics games. And I thought it's just really wild to me that they actually that they
01:47:33 would make a game that combines those two things. I just think that's neat as hell.
01:47:38 And I probably fuck around with that some more this week. Because, you know,
01:47:43 if I like I like video games, I'd like to play them for fun.
01:47:47 I like to play them for not fun. I like to play them for rage.
01:47:51 Play them for spite. I'll play them for for hate's sake. I spit at the.
01:47:57 I do it to spite my parents who said you'll never play video games. And I'll show them.
01:48:03 They said I couldn't do it. They said I couldn't do it, but I did it. They said,
01:48:10 they said you'll never beat Undertale. It's too hard. Well, you'll never be cloudy. Well,
01:48:17 guess, well guess what? I fucking did it. I fucking got the good ending to mom.
01:48:24 Um, fuck you.
01:48:29 Uh, you want to go to voicemails? Yeah.
01:48:34 Okay. Unless there's any unless there's any bullshit you want to bring up.
01:48:38 Uh, well, there was that one time that cow took a shit.
01:48:41 All right, you got them up. You ready?
01:48:50 Speak pipe.com slash the PCP voicemail. How do you do it?
01:48:57 Well, speak pipe.com slash PCP voicemail. That's how you send us a voicemail and we listen to it
01:49:02 on the show and we don't we don't have any any quality standards whatsoever.
01:49:08 Uh, except occasionally, but very rarely, almost any little play almost anything,
01:49:14 uh, Lamal. Uh, so send us your most racist shit. No. And we will seriously engage with it.
01:49:23 We will treat it as valid. I promise. Uh, or do I? Uh, are you ready?
01:49:33 Uh, the first one is called seven. Oh, so yeah. Yep.
01:49:38 Okay. Three, two, one, go.
01:49:42 Climate change. Am I right, fellas? You're right.
01:49:45 Fucking climate change. Nobody likes climate change.
01:49:50 Climate change is shit. It's fucking everything up.
01:49:53 Now I'm not claiming that I have the solution to climate change because I don't.
01:49:58 What I have is fucking information that might reveal the ultimate cause of it.
01:50:04 Right. So what we're told are the two leading causes of climate change.
01:50:08 It's the fucking coal mining industry and the fucking farming industry.
01:50:12 We have these heavy fucking machines, production, all this fucking shit that's going up into the
01:50:18 stratosphere. We all know how climate change works. I'm sure. Right. And it's causing fucking
01:50:23 climate change. This shit in fucking air caused by fucking. Is this is just like
01:50:28 in the fucking farming. Now before we had these heavy machines, you know what we had?
01:50:32 We had slaves. So ultimately climate change is the fault of two men.
01:50:39 Number one, Abraham Lincoln, number two, Martin Luther King Jr.
01:50:43 And if you disagree, you are also to blame for climate change. Okay. Discuss.
01:50:50 Well, I don't I don't see any fault in this logic.
01:50:55 The isn't like me saying a greenhouse gas.
01:51:00 Don't don't we don't fart that? Or is that just cows?
01:51:04 We probably do, but not as much. I mean,
01:51:09 I don't fucking know. I guess I guess he's right. You know what?
01:51:13 He's I guess he's right. I guess slavery was pretty based after all.
01:51:16 And you know what? I think it's time for us all to be slaves, every single one of us.
01:51:21 We get the get the fucking throw away the keys. It's jangles chains up. We don't need to be
01:51:26 chained because we're doing it voluntarily, but it's like for the aesthetic, I guess.
01:51:30 Let's get all those chains around our necks. Bring back slavery, but with a twist,
01:51:35 there were literally all of us become slaves. No masters, only slaves.
01:51:40 Yeah, people look up and it's like, who's whipping with me? There's no one.
01:51:43 There's no one there. It's like, shut up. Just keep you got to do it.
01:51:47 Digging. You're responsible for your whipping yourself.
01:51:52 Yeah, you got to pick yourself up. You got to pick yourself up by your whip straps.
01:51:57 If you really think about it, rule slaves to whatever we want to do.
01:52:04 We are slaves to our own free will. Yeah, right.
01:52:07 To our own free choice and association with our fellow man.
01:52:11 Damn. Got to say, I never never thought about it like that.
01:52:15 Next one. Oh my God, these are great. These are great so far. Next one is called
01:52:19 Why the ethno state is a good idea and you should support it. Damn, voicemails on point.
01:52:25 You know, last week we had shitty voicemails. This time they were like,
01:52:28 we got a fucking step of the quality and they did it. Three, two, one, go.
01:52:34 Konnichiwa. Oh, oh, okay, okay. Samurai-sama, see how it is. Here he comes.
01:52:44 Voicemail, fan favorite, brother character, Samurai-sama. He said,
01:52:51 Konnichiwa, you react like that. Well, Samurai-sama, come this week to finally accept
01:53:00 to apologize. Very happy, but you, after honoring here, Konnichiwa, react like that.
01:53:09 Well, fuck you. We didn't react enough. That's the problem.
01:53:13 Return no Samurai-sama. At this point, you honorly have yourself to blame.
01:53:21 This is abuse, honestly. See you next time. Sayonara.
01:53:25 This is the abuse tactic wherein you just, you abuse someone
01:53:32 and then they react negatively to the abuse and then you say,
01:53:36 see, it's because you act like that. It's because you act like that that I have to treat you this
01:53:42 way. This is what it is. This is an abusive relationship now. There's no way out.
01:53:52 It really was unfortunate that we'd said absolutely nothing and that the whole point
01:53:57 of the thing was that, oh, you react like that? I think it makes sense. I mean, it makes sense,
01:54:02 right? I would be offended if I introduced myself. And we didn't go, oh my god.
01:54:09 No reaction whatsoever. Next is an, oh lord, next one. Now here's a fan favorite,
01:54:19 a real fan favorite if ever there was one. And we should put these two in a,
01:54:24 in a, some sort of deathmatch against each other. Riddle my ass, Batman. Here we go. Three, two, one, go.
01:54:34 Hello. Riddle my ass, Batman here. Yes. Yes, I'm ready. The question for one thing
01:54:40 is still going on. It's going to be the second episode coming up right after this or possibly
01:54:43 two after this. And it's still going on, but I'm on a shittier mic now because my laptop broke.
01:54:53 I will tell you the story in a second. It involves... This is just a voicemail about why he couldn't make
01:54:58 the voice... ...mander and origins and masturbation. Well, look forward to that story in a minute.
01:55:04 I'm excited. Anyway, that's why I'm on my phone microphone right now. So just so you know,
01:55:09 it's kind of shit. Oh, and RiddleMyAssBatman.com, class Patreon, or whatever the fuck it's called,
01:55:14 you know how to find it. It does exist. You just have to look it up when it exists. I didn't take
01:55:20 it to account. The fact that you were in it a week early. I was in it. Sorry. Okay, on with the show.
01:55:27 Oh, it's just explaining the context for his next voicemail.
01:55:39 I'm going to die. Well, now we're fully rarity for the next one, a bird and origin masturbation.
01:55:50 Hold on. Hold on. It's in the next one. Okay, Patreon, Patreon.com slash RiddleMyAssBatman.
01:56:06 No, it's not... It doesn't exist. It's not there. Wait, what? Let me try RiddleMyAssBatman.com.
01:56:20 No. No.
01:56:26 Well, he reversed him, right? He said like RiddleMyAssBatman.patreon.com or slash...
01:56:35 It's not... It's not real. It's a fantasy. It's a mere... It's a rooster illusion.
01:56:43 Uh, RiddleMyAssBatman YouTube. Maybe there's a link from here.
01:56:51 What? Where? Where do you see it? Where?
01:56:53 I just googled RiddleMyAssBatman. I got to a YouTube channel.
01:57:00 There's no link. There's no link to it.
01:57:03 I mean, he had the... Was it Wattpad or what was like the...
01:57:07 There was the page where his stories, like the novel version was.
01:57:15 Okay. Okay. The trail's gone cold. The trail's gone cold. All right.
01:57:20 Let's hear what he's got to say about a bird, an orange, and masturbation. Shall we?
01:57:25 Yeah.
01:57:26 Three, two, one, go.
01:57:30 Okay, the bird, orange, and masturbation story.
01:57:33 Here we go.
01:57:34 I was masturbating while eating an orange.
01:57:37 Same.
01:57:38 Because I consider orange to be an erotic fruit, in my opinion, an aphrodisiac.
01:57:44 Turn me on. And I treat myself good. Anyway, my bird, she squawks like a bad hell.
01:57:53 And it scares the living Jesus out of me for just a moment.
01:57:57 And I squeezed the orange. And just because of the angle I happened to have it at,
01:58:02 I squeezed the orange right into a sensitive spot on my dick, right into the fucking hole.
01:58:07 Right in the...
01:58:09 It burned like nobody's business. And it caused me to drop my laptop and I broke it.
01:58:15 Now, of course, I'm, you know, I'm halfway through a fat.
01:58:20 I mean, what am I supposed to do? I'm supposed to stop there?
01:58:22 No. No, I can't stop just a minute away through a fat. You got to finish your fat.
01:58:26 So I grabbed the nearest erotic thing I can find.
01:58:29 The calendar from Ragscon.
01:58:33 Yes, the Ragscon swimsuit calendar.
01:58:37 The calendar knows which picture I used.
01:58:41 And there's so many good ones.
01:58:43 There's so many to choose from.
01:58:44 That's what I did, yeah.
01:58:45 And that's why I don't have a laptop anymore.
01:58:48 Was it worth it?
01:58:49 Yes. Okay.
01:58:52 That's the explanation. Same PCB time, same PCB channel.
01:58:55 On with the show, Quest for Corona episode 2. Bye.
01:58:59 Sound off in the comments.
01:59:01 Okay, commenters, if you backed Ragscon 4 and you have the calendar,
01:59:08 let us know in the comments which month you think Riddle My Ass Batman finished his fat too.
01:59:18 Because there's no wrong answers, really.
01:59:21 They're all good choices, in my opinion.
01:59:24 I think, I'm going to guess it might be the solo munchy one, if you remember what that looks like.
01:59:34 Yeah, I think I strongly objected to that one.
01:59:38 On the grounds of it, crossing the line from Etchy to Full-on Hentai.
01:59:45 I found it, it was no, yeah, lascivious, lascivious.
01:59:55 But they wouldn't have it.
01:59:56 There's a fucking story about bird orange and masturbation.
02:00:02 The bird had almost nothing to do with it.
02:00:04 It squawked.
02:00:06 Yeah.
02:00:06 Like, so much of it seems silly and like, why, how, what orange, why would you have an orange?
02:00:15 Well, he explained in the text, he considers it an erotic fruit and he treats himself good.
02:00:21 I know, it's just, it seems like it's a bit, but it could actually,
02:00:24 like, feel like it could actually have happened, which is the funny part.
02:00:28 I don't, I don't, I don't, in one hand, wait, in one hand you have an orange.
02:00:34 I don't know what about it makes you think it's a bit.
02:00:38 Because it's so fucking silly, Ben, who eats an orange while holding their laptop and
02:00:45 masturbating.
02:00:45 That's just life.
02:00:46 You know, life's truth is stranger than fiction sometimes.
02:00:48 Go straight into the pee hole.
02:00:50 I know, I know, I know you're uncomfortable.
02:00:53 I know you can't stare unblinkingly into the void of meaning that is reality.
02:00:59 But I can, and that's what, and that's what I do.
02:01:03 Whenever, when Riddle My Ass Batman leaves as a voicemail.
02:01:08 This is, this is, this, accept it.
02:01:10 The sooner you accept that this is what life is, the sooner you can just get on with it,
02:01:15 you know?
02:01:16 I don't know what's real anymore.
02:01:17 I see things on the internet and I'm like, that's not true.
02:01:20 And then it is.
02:01:21 It's always true.
02:01:23 It's always true.
02:01:26 Next one?
02:01:27 Yep.
02:01:28 Next one is called Thoughts.
02:01:30 Three, that's with a G-H, like in your brain.
02:01:33 Three, two, one, go.
02:01:36 Hey, what are your thoughts on Donkey Kong?
02:01:40 I like him.
02:01:42 Gib, thoughts on Donkey Kong?
02:01:45 Donkey Kong is a pretty funny guy.
02:01:48 He's big and he has a fun game called Donkey Kong Country.
02:01:52 One and two, maybe, he's not in three.
02:01:55 And then he's in Smash.
02:01:56 He's not in two either.
02:01:58 He's not in two either, you fucking nerd.
02:02:01 He's, he's in trouble.
02:02:04 In the third one, I feel like he's just gone.
02:02:06 He's just gone.
02:02:07 He's gotta be somewhere in three.
02:02:09 I never played three, let me be clear.
02:02:11 I played three.
02:02:12 You know, I didn't, as a kid, it seems like public opinion now
02:02:18 is that three was not as good as two.
02:02:21 I never noticed much of a difference.
02:02:24 I thought they were both just fucking great.
02:02:27 And I never beat either of them
02:02:28 because they were both way too hard for me as a kid.
02:02:30 I think it's really just a surface level detail.
02:02:33 Kitty Kong is a fucking freak and he's not as epic and swag as Diddy Kong.
02:02:40 With his beatbox.
02:02:41 I've heard people say that three is like more gimmicky
02:02:45 or like has more like like bullshit in it.
02:02:48 And I've heard critiques of it that I forget what it is.
02:02:52 People have like reasons.
02:02:54 But as a kid, I just thought they,
02:02:56 I just thought three looked really nice.
02:02:59 And I like collecting silver coins.
02:03:01 And I thought the silver coins looked nicer than the gold ones.
02:03:05 And I probably just liked it on that basis.
02:03:08 I mean, I didn't play too much of three,
02:03:10 but I did like the beginning few levels
02:03:12 where it's just sort of nice, sort of, I don't know,
02:03:16 almost like American red pine forestry like pine wood.
02:03:21 Nice, like unusual for monkeys to be there.
02:03:24 Like unusual for like the Kong people.
02:03:26 Oh yeah, snow levels.
02:03:28 I think I like that about it too, that it just had snow levels.
02:03:31 And you had a hovercraft.
02:03:32 And you could drive a little hovercraft around the world map.
02:03:35 The fact that you could, that was so cool, right?
02:03:38 Like you're not constrained to a linear path.
02:03:42 Yeah.
02:03:43 Yeah.
02:03:43 You're not just doing, you're not just doing like a Mario three,
02:03:46 like world to world on the line thing.
02:03:48 You hop in your, I mean, on the, on the land you are,
02:03:51 but like you hop in your fucking little hovercraft
02:03:53 and get on the ocean and you go, and there's little secrets.
02:03:57 Like there's secrets in the ocean, right?
02:03:59 Like you circle around like a rock
02:04:00 and it turns into a hidden level.
02:04:02 Oh my God, what a fucking video game.
02:04:05 I should replay them.
02:04:07 They were, they were very difficult for me.
02:04:09 Answer your question, Mr. voicemail man, Donkey Kong, whatever.
02:04:15 But the, I like the games, the guy, the monkey himself.
02:04:20 Eh, it's fine.
02:04:22 He's finally here, the leader of the bunch,
02:04:25 coconut gong, Kong, Donkey Kong.
02:04:31 Donkey Kong.
02:04:32 Donkey Kong.
02:04:34 Donkey Kong.
02:04:36 Donkey Kong.
02:04:38 One hell of a guy.
02:04:40 Okay.
02:04:42 Next one is called a bright outlook.
02:04:46 Three, two, one, go.
02:04:48 Just wanted to say some words of encouragement.
02:04:52 Thanks man.
02:04:54 You guys are chads, you know, you guys are troopers.
02:04:56 That's true.
02:04:57 Sticking around, still being here.
02:04:59 Agreed.
02:05:00 Doing your own things, doing your own art, doing good.
02:05:04 Doing your own podcasts, some Patreon stuff.
02:05:07 Good stuff, you know.
02:05:08 Keep it up.
02:05:09 Here's to a good year.
02:05:11 And I hope that maybe all the Radcon stuff could come out.
02:05:16 That'd be pretty sick.
02:05:17 What are you guys saying?
02:05:17 I think that's a good goal for 2021, right?
02:05:19 I think all the Radcon stuff will be out this year.
02:05:22 Sorry, lads.
02:05:23 Have a good one.
02:05:26 Don't be sorry, we have to do that.
02:05:28 Yeah, I think the stuff that is getting done is definitely on track to be done, you know.
02:05:41 Before the year gets too far in, everything else we will figure out.
02:05:46 We can definitely have it all out this year.
02:05:49 For some specific people, for some specific bits of it, you know.
02:05:53 Yeah, we gotta kick some asses.
02:05:55 Thank you for the encouragement.
02:05:59 We'll do that with pleasure.
02:06:00 We'll do that with pleasure.
02:06:06 Yes, all the Radcon stuff will come out this year.
02:06:08 And because of that, it will not be a good year.
02:06:11 It will be a bad year, because the content will be bad and you will hate it.
02:06:16 Yes, you will say we waited all year for this.
02:06:19 You'll say I waited my whole life.
02:06:21 If you said I ever since I pledged to Radcon and then I literally didn't leave my house
02:06:26 for a fucking year and change because all I wanted was this content and then you'll get it.
02:06:31 And it won't fill the hole inside you and you'll say what was it all for?
02:06:34 And the answer will be nothing.
02:06:37 Damn, bleak.
02:06:43 Next voicemail.
02:06:45 Wait a second, did I get that one?
02:06:47 Yeah, I did.
02:06:48 Next voicemail is called Let's Kill Fat Ben.
02:06:52 Three, two, one, go.
02:06:55 All right, Ben.
02:06:57 Last week you said it would take until about April to get rid of Fat Ben.
02:07:00 Maybe.
02:07:00 And as a fellow disgraced keto boy myself, I kind of wanted on this.
02:07:04 So I'm going to use the tool of public internet shaming to keep both you and me on track.
02:07:09 So I'm going to start today.
02:07:11 What about you?
02:07:12 How's the past week been?
02:07:13 And isn't it about time we started lifting again?
02:07:16 See you next time.
02:07:18 Yeah, I was lifting for a little bit there for a couple weeks.
02:07:24 I fell off it again and I haven't in a few weeks now, which is shit.
02:07:30 I already said that I'm back on keto, which has not, I have not lost any weight,
02:07:35 which is very frustrating.
02:07:37 But what I do need to actually start doing in addition to just being keto is calorie counting.
02:07:43 I need to start like cooking very specific things and knowing the calorie counts and like
02:07:49 logging them and like actually keeping myself to like a numerical limit.
02:07:53 That's, that's the thing that I have not, that's, that's what I need.
02:07:57 This, this is secret sauce.
02:07:58 I got to add into it.
02:07:59 If I do that, then I'm guaranteed to kill Fat Ben in a reasonable timeframe.
02:08:07 And lifting again would be good too.
02:08:08 I should definitely do that also.
02:08:10 Why, why would you lift away from the earth when you could push the earth instead?
02:08:18 I'm sorry?
02:08:20 Instead of lifting, you push downwards.
02:08:25 It's easier.
02:08:26 What?
02:08:27 Much easier.
02:08:28 That's a body weight exercise.
02:08:30 You just push the earth.
02:08:31 That's what, that's what a pushup is.
02:08:32 You're moving the entire earth when you push.
02:08:35 You are.
02:08:36 But, you know, in a minute, in an infinitesimal way, because it's like, you know, between you
02:08:41 and the earth, you each, it's between your center of gravity and like the difference in
02:08:46 mass is so vast that the equal and opposite reaction, just keep pushing, just push the
02:08:53 earth, just keep pushing everything.
02:08:56 Just you get down, you get down on the ground.
02:08:59 Stop lifting, stop dropping, stop dropping things.
02:09:02 Stop walking things.
02:09:03 Put your hands on the ground, jump, jump, jump, jump, moving all around.
02:09:17 You know that, that first song?
02:09:20 What is that called?
02:09:21 I know the second one was Caramel Dancin'.
02:09:23 Do you know that song that I was just humming there?
02:09:25 No, I've never heard it.
02:09:27 It's, there was a, there was a, there was a New Ground song,
02:09:31 animation of a bunch of like video game characters.
02:09:35 It was like really crappy, like old like New Ground's flash style animation in the sort of
02:09:40 pseudo anime style that was popular at the time.
02:09:43 And it's that song is playing, and they're all playing DDR.
02:09:48 Jump on the ground, jump, jump, jump, jump, moving all around.
02:09:53 Maybe it's called Jump on the Ground.
02:09:55 It was probably called Jump on the Ground.
02:09:57 Anyway, that was Caramel Dancin' before Caramel Dancin' was Caramel Dancin'.
02:10:04 Ted Dancin'.
02:10:05 Okay.
02:10:06 Anyway, next one is called Die.
02:10:09 Three, two, one, go.
02:10:12 To all of you guys asking them to stop the podcast or kill the podcast.
02:10:19 How does that benefit you?
02:10:20 Oh yeah.
02:10:21 You can just leave, stop watching, unsubscribe, go away, die.
02:10:30 Like if they kill the podcast, what does that help you?
02:10:34 Yeah, there was one or two commenters.
02:10:38 That's stupid.
02:10:38 There's one or two comments on the last one.
02:10:41 Every now and then we get one.
02:10:42 That's just like, just kill the podcast already.
02:10:45 And like, yeah, and actually yesterday I responded to someone saying like,
02:10:52 but you're literally here watching, listening to it.
02:10:55 You're literally here on the giving us the view.
02:10:59 So like, why?
02:11:01 It's, I mean, I know why, but it's just a really petty like stupid reason.
02:11:06 It's because from their point of view,
02:11:09 like the show that they once loved is now ruined.
02:11:14 And every time they see it, they're reminded of better times.
02:11:17 And they sort of tears form in their eyes when they realize that it's just not the same.
02:11:22 And it's like, that is not a good enough reason for us to do anything.
02:11:26 Yeah, sure.
02:11:27 Just get some blinders, get some horse blinders on.
02:11:31 They probably know.
02:11:32 I mean, they probably know that we won't do it.
02:11:34 But I guess they just want to let us know that in their opinion, it's what we should do.
02:11:42 And okay.
02:11:42 Yeah, whatever.
02:11:46 Yeah, we're just, we're just, we're just never going to agree on this, I guess.
02:11:50 You think we should die and we think we shouldn't.
02:11:52 And there's just, there's really no middle ground there.
02:11:55 Yeah, or you should, you should be active about it.
02:11:57 You know, try to destroy us, cancel us, create your own podcast and make fun of us.
02:12:04 What did, what did I see?
02:12:05 Oh God, I saw an image.
02:12:07 I think it was on Twitter like yesterday.
02:12:10 Well, what the fuck was it?
02:12:13 It was, it was something and it was captioned like,
02:12:17 if it was like, if you hate me, either kill me or shut the fuck up.
02:12:25 It was funny in context, but I don't remember what the context was.
02:12:28 But anyway, yeah, if you, if you hate us so much, we're not, we're not going to kill,
02:12:33 we're not going to end the show.
02:12:34 You're literally going to have to come and kill us yourself.
02:12:38 God, I shouldn't say that.
02:12:40 They'll fucking do it.
02:12:41 They'll fucking do it soon.
02:12:44 If I'm, if I'm not on the next episode,
02:12:46 know that it's because someone took me up on that offer.
02:12:51 Uh-oh.
02:12:53 Gulp.
02:12:54 Uh, next one.
02:12:56 Oh my God, we're almost done.
02:12:58 We're almost done.
02:12:59 And, you know, honestly, these voicemails have been pretty decent this week.
02:13:03 These are, these are, these are all right.
02:13:04 These haven't been too annoying.
02:13:06 So pretty cool.
02:13:08 Uh, last voicemail is called an actually somewhat obscure Pokemon game.
02:13:14 Three, two, one, go.
02:13:16 Heart gold, soul silver, not obscure, their main series games.
02:13:19 Most Pokemon games are not obscure.
02:13:21 Pokemon's huge.
02:13:22 It's hard to have an obscure game in a franchise so big,
02:13:24 especially if it was released in English.
02:13:26 Conquest.
02:13:26 Probably the most obscure English game that is actually great.
02:13:31 And obscure might even be putting it too hard is a Pokemon conquest.
02:13:36 Really straight as the DS was dying and the 3DS was already out.
02:13:40 In the dip between, uh, there was sort of a popularity dip of Pokemon at that point
02:13:45 of time before completely surging in the 3DS games.
02:13:49 It was also targeted towards older teens and adult, which again was kind of a dip and would be,
02:13:55 it would do so much better if it was released today is basically.
02:13:58 He has not said what it is.
02:13:59 It's crossover in Nobu Naga's ambition.
02:14:01 Yes, historical Nobu Naga, the samurai.
02:14:03 He has a Zekrom and he's a pretty big deal in that game
02:14:06 as he was an actual Japanese history.
02:14:10 It plays like Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics
02:14:13 because nobody knows what Nobu Naga's ambition is in America.
02:14:18 Has a pretty interesting story.
02:14:19 Total on Fire Emblem is the best thing I've ever heard.
02:14:20 If you like Texas gameplay, Pokemon Samurai's
02:14:23 and, uh, late DS aesthetics would recommend Pokemon Conquest
02:14:28 because it's certainly more obscure than HeartGold and SoulSilver.
02:14:32 People love those games.
02:14:34 People constantly talk about them.
02:14:35 They're not obscure.
02:14:36 I, I, actually.
02:14:37 If you're going to talk about obscure Pokemon stuff,
02:14:39 know something at least mildly obscure that isn't a main series game.
02:14:44 I might actually go and play that because, um,
02:14:47 I love the gameplay of Fire Emblem and I dislike the gameplay of Pokemon so much
02:14:52 that might, that might be cool.
02:14:54 Well, have you played, um, have you played the, the Mystery Dungeon?
02:14:59 I have.
02:15:00 I like those.
02:15:01 Okay.
02:15:02 Okay.
02:15:03 Um, I mean, this looks similar to that, but
02:15:08 I mean, I, I wonder how, like,
02:15:10 Mystery Dungeon is not like Fire Emblem in the same way.
02:15:14 Yeah, okay.
02:15:14 Because it's like you just move one thing at a time.
02:15:17 It's honestly, this is like Turn Lua.
02:15:20 I assume if it's Fire Emblem Life then it's Turn Lua.
02:15:23 What actually turns me off from this is that it's like,
02:15:27 has humans, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
02:15:32 No, I don't see any human, I don't see any human in characters.
02:15:36 It would be like humans who have Pokemon, right?
02:15:38 And they fight using those.
02:15:40 No, this, this is a man.
02:15:44 This is a man right here, right?
02:15:46 Like, between that Arceus and that Darumaka.
02:15:52 Darumaka, Darumaka.
02:15:55 If you get to kill people, that would be great.
02:15:59 Yeah.
02:16:00 Look at the little black person in the corner.
02:16:02 Honestly, yeah, like, I don't, I don't really love the actual,
02:16:06 like, gameplay part of, um, the, the Mystery Dungeon.
02:16:10 Like, it was fine.
02:16:11 I used to really like, like tactics, uh, you know, um,
02:16:15 grid based, like a tactical RPGs like this.
02:16:19 If this were just that with Pokemon, I might think that was pretty cool.
02:16:23 The fact that it's tacked on to the fucking Nobunaga's ambition, which like,
02:16:28 what the fuck, uh, is, is kind of a big turn off.
02:16:32 Like, I don't want to fucking deal with like,
02:16:37 wall.
02:16:38 Look at that.
02:16:38 That's cool.
02:16:39 I like that.
02:16:40 I don't, I don't, I don't want to fucking know.
02:16:45 I don't want to deal with these fucking, these humans.
02:16:48 You just don't want it.
02:16:49 You just don't want them to say directly into the camera.
02:16:54 Konnichiwa.
02:16:55 You don't want them to do that.
02:16:58 I mean, they'll do it.
02:17:01 If the, if the, if the premise of the game is that like, you are a fucking,
02:17:07 I don't know, like a foolish samurai warrior and you've got your fucking six Pokemon team.
02:17:15 And you got to, you got to catch Pokemon and you get to fight your way.
02:17:18 If this is like, if it's like, it's like Pokemon, it's the premise of a Pokemon game,
02:17:24 but it's set in like feudal Japan and it like plays out that way.
02:17:29 That would be awesome.
02:17:30 But I feel like it's definitely not that it's probably some bullshit.
02:17:34 It's probably actually just like this other game, but like some of the characters have
02:17:38 been reskinned to be Pokemon.
02:17:41 All right.
02:17:41 I, I'll, I'll download it illegally and play it and then I'll get back to you.
02:17:46 Okay.
02:17:47 Yeah.
02:17:48 Let's be like a thing to keep track of.
02:17:51 You should, you should do a podcast.
02:17:52 You should do a fucking GRPJ about Pokemon conquests.
02:17:58 Bring that back.
02:17:59 Dude, little Curlia.
02:18:02 Show me.
02:18:04 Show me fucking Curlia.
02:18:06 She's like doing a magic right now.
02:18:09 Ooh.
02:18:09 Wow.
02:18:12 Um, they're like fighting beach balls or something.
02:18:18 Pokemon.
02:18:19 I mean, hmm, Pokemon in other formats is a cool idea.
02:18:25 I just, I feel like if this were good, more people would talk about it because it is so obscure.
02:18:33 You, you'd, you'd literally never heard about it.
02:18:35 I had heard about it because I do feel like
02:18:38 if it were, because I was literally googling myself.
02:18:40 I was googling a Pokemon conquest because I made that fucking Nuzlocke about it.
02:18:45 And then I was like, I found this and it was like, wait a minute,
02:18:48 there's a game called that and it was this and I was like shocked and horrified.
02:18:54 I think that the reason nobody knows about this would be,
02:18:58 like the guy said, in between DS and 3DS.
02:19:02 And also it's not a traditional Pokemon game.
02:19:04 So people are like, oh, it's not the game I know.
02:19:06 I don't care.
02:19:07 And then nobody cared.
02:19:08 But it could be a secret hidden gem.
02:19:11 I mean, I, well, I think it's probably that because of it's weird,
02:19:17 the weird time it was released.
02:19:18 I mean, it's a crossover series with something that nobody in the West has ever fucking heard of.
02:19:24 Nobody, wait a minute.
02:19:26 Are the Nobunaga's ambitions games, like are they called something else in America?
02:19:30 They're called Japan Fight.
02:19:37 Amazing.
02:19:39 Okay.
02:19:40 I was thinking they might be called something else in America,
02:19:42 but no, I don't think they are.
02:19:45 Yeah.
02:19:45 So it's a crossover with something.
02:19:46 Maybe it's popular in Japan and maybe more people know about it over there.
02:19:50 But in America, it's like, why, like, how would you even explain what this is to a Western child?
02:19:56 Like, well, it's like a, it's like a historical, like, period piece, but we put Pokemon in it.
02:20:03 Like, if I were Nintendo, I also probably just wouldn't even bother advertising it in the West.
02:20:08 So I think they made the right call.
02:20:11 Honestly, honestly, it sort of seems like a bit of a, I feel like it's a little bit of a brand
02:20:19 mismatch.
02:20:20 And probably, if they were asking me, should we make,
02:20:24 making me like it more?
02:20:25 I like that no, no Pokemon fan would enjoy this.
02:20:28 If they were, if they were, if I was, if I was a big wig at Nintendo and some fucking
02:20:33 interns, some intern was like, I have a passion project I've always wanted to make.
02:20:37 What if, what if we combine Nobunaga's ambition with Pokemon?
02:20:40 Look, I mean, I spent my sleepless nights.
02:20:42 I spent my weekends at the office making this prototype.
02:20:45 What do you think, boss?
02:20:46 I would say no, absolutely not.
02:20:48 This is brand mismanagement.
02:20:49 This will damage our fucking family friendly image.
02:20:53 This is like, this is fucked up and you're a piece of shit and you're going to jail.
02:21:01 And I would end that interns life right there.
02:21:03 I would say put your hat on my fucking desk and I would take out my katana and behead him
02:21:07 right there and make an example of him.
02:21:11 Like this is what you do and you fuck with the Pokemon company.
02:21:15 When you fuck with our brand, you die.
02:21:18 And that would, and that would be, that would be it.
02:21:20 And then, and then we lesson learned.
02:21:22 And hopefully it would only have to be the one and no one would ever do.
02:21:25 Maybe that's what happened.
02:21:26 Maybe that's why this never happened again.
02:21:28 Because they put this game existed and someone got executed.
02:21:32 And they were like, well, we know not to fuck around.
02:21:35 The guy, this guy fucked around and found out.
02:21:38 Is what I'm saying.
02:21:40 Anyway, yeah, looks, let me know, let me know if it's fun.
02:21:43 Yep.
02:21:44 Okay.
02:21:47 Uh, well, shit, that's the last voicemail.
02:21:49 We're free.
02:21:51 Oh, no.
02:21:52 Wait, wait.
02:21:53 It's time for a Bitcoin update.
02:21:58 Zero.
02:22:01 Oh, there's no more Bitcoin.
02:22:03 Bitcoin's canceled.
02:22:05 It's actually costs money to have Bitcoin now.
02:22:08 No, as you, as you see.
02:22:09 It's minus 10.
02:22:10 Okay.
02:22:11 It dipped a bit, but it kind of bounced back and it's a little lower than it was before.
02:22:16 We're at 33, we're at 33, 550.
02:22:20 So there you go.
02:22:22 Uh, uh, all my money is gone.
02:22:29 But next week I'll be rich.
02:22:31 It's going to the moon.
02:22:32 Give Bitcoin, it's, it's, people think it can't rise any higher.
02:22:37 They're wrong.
02:22:38 Ye a little faith.
02:22:40 It's going to the moon.
02:22:42 They haven't seen nothing yet.
02:22:43 It's going to be, it's going to, it's going to triple again.
02:22:45 It's going to triple again.
02:22:47 It's going to hit 50K.
02:22:48 It's going to hit 50K this year.
02:22:50 It's only a matter of time.
02:22:51 Just got to hold it.
02:22:52 Just got to hold it for long enough.
02:22:59 Okay.
02:23:01 Sorry, I'm just googling Pokemon conquest ROM and maybe it's like so nobody cares about it.
02:23:06 It's hard to find.
02:23:09 Oh wait, no, I may have found it.
02:23:11 Was it on the DS?
02:23:13 DS, yeah.
02:23:15 God, I love still having my, my R4, my DS, uh, pirate thingy.
02:23:22 I'm going to play all of classics.
02:23:24 Is that the thing that you can like the cartridge you put games on?
02:23:27 Yeah, you can put games on it using a USB to SD card thingy and then you just play them
02:23:33 and they fucking work.
02:23:35 I think I had one of those.
02:23:37 I think I had one of those.
02:23:38 I think Nate got me one at one point.
02:23:40 I think that was what I played heart gold on in the run that Brunswick came from all those years ago.
02:23:51 I wonder where, I wonder where that is.
02:23:53 I feel like that cartridge that had that copy of heart gold on it is like in a box in my parents house
02:23:59 somewhere or, or some, it's got to be somewhere.
02:24:03 It wouldn't have been thrown out.
02:24:04 It's really under a fucking shelf somewhere that no human will ever lay eyes on again.
02:24:15 Hidden treasure.
02:24:17 One piece.
02:24:18 Are we done?
02:24:19 Are we, are we,
02:24:20 can't-
02:24:21 Yeah.
02:24:22 What happened?
02:24:24 Patreon, patreon.com slash the procrastinators, right?
02:24:30 Yeah, what, why'd you keep asking me?
02:24:33 Yes.
02:24:33 Because I never, okay, okay, give a bonus episode.
02:24:38 Uh, we did a bonus episode.
02:24:40 I think it should be coming out soon, right?
02:24:43 We did one last month that should be releasing soon.
02:24:46 Yeah, what was it?
02:24:46 Is that the one where I get really salty?
02:24:48 Is that the one with Gamers Tavern?
02:24:51 The one with Gamers, yes, I'm really salty.
02:24:53 I complain about everyone and Gamers Tavern's there and we do the fucking thing again where we,
02:24:58 where we do the retrospective on the other time Gamers Tavern was on the show and it's fucking,
02:25:06 it gets, it gets hot, one might say.
02:25:09 Okay, the end.
02:25:11 Goodbye, see you next week.
02:25:13 Happy New Year, America 2020.
02:25:15 Uh, uh, what?
02:25:16 I don't even know what that means.
02:25:17 Okay, good night.
02:25:20 Yeah, good night.
02:25:20 Bye-bye.
