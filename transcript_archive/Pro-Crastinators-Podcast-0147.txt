00:00:00 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, where we clip the mic every single time.
00:00:15 I'm Ben Saint, and who else is fuckin' here?
00:00:20 We got Nate Bestman, the best guy ever.
00:00:23 Konnichiwa minasamah onigashima.
00:00:27 Oh, hi ogozaimasu.
00:00:29 We got Lethal Aurora Mage here.
00:00:33 Oh, hi y'all.
00:00:35 Oh, Shinkansen desuwa, we got Hippocrit.
00:00:41 Guten Morgen.
00:00:43 Holy shit, fuckin' Nuremberg trial time, and we got Digibro.
00:00:49 Hungover, pissed off, ready to kill.
00:00:54 Oh, hi ogozaimasu.
00:01:00 What's goin' on?
00:01:04 You pissed off about the Crunchyroll Awards from yesterday, Digi?
00:01:08 I saw you streamin' those.
00:01:10 I'm pissed off about living in a shit toilet earth.
00:01:13 That's what I'm pissed off about.
00:01:15 I'm pissed off about everybody being wrong about everything.
00:01:17 I'm mad that, you know what?
00:01:20 I'm just sick and tired of pretending like it's okay for people to have different opinions from me.
00:01:24 But Digi, you just said there can't be a critical authority.
00:01:28 What the fuck, dude?
00:01:30 What do you have to say to that?
00:01:31 Well, obviously the man was wrong.
00:01:35 Obviously, you know what?
00:01:36 It's not about having authority.
00:01:39 It's about taking matters into my own hands, you know what I'm sayin'?
00:01:42 Public genocide and all that.
00:01:44 The beta uprising and whatnot.
00:01:46 Yeah.
00:01:48 You know, I thought, I was thinkin' about this after your loud video about how JoJo Part 5 has shit character designs or whatever, how the guys don't blend into the background.
00:01:58 And I was like, okay, fair.
00:02:00 But I think I know why everybody voted for it.
00:02:03 I mean, I don't know how they, I assume it works on Oscar's logic.
00:02:05 I think what they do, this is a complete guess, but everybody just saw like how, quote, fabulous all the JoJo posing is.
00:02:15 And how fabulous all the like thick outline characters look.
00:02:19 And that's all they needed.
00:02:19 I'll tell you, it's because the anime awards are a popularity contest.
00:02:23 Because it literally is fan-voted.
00:02:25 So it's just whatever's the most popular show in the world.
00:02:27 Oh, fan-voted should not even win every time.
00:02:30 That's a shit show in the making.
00:02:33 No, my rage had nothing to do with the actual award.
00:02:37 It was that what I livestreamed my reactions to the Crunchyroll Awards.
00:02:40 And I was shitting on the art in JoJo Part 5.
00:02:45 And my chat was like, was all pissed off at me.
00:02:49 So then I made a separate video screaming about it additionally.
00:02:53 And then, and I had also tweeted.
00:02:56 And it's one of those cases where, you know, when you're tweet, when you, when you make a spicy controversial tweet and it escapes from your audience and enters the open internet, that's what happened.
00:03:07 So it was just hundreds and hundreds of JoJo stands crawling out of the woodwork to call me a boomer for some reason.
00:03:13 There's a lot of those.
00:03:14 Is that what you call like a fan?
00:03:16 Is that what you call like a rabid fan of JoJo, a stand?
00:03:20 Well, hey, all right.
00:03:22 That's pretty funny.
00:03:23 They have those for other things, right?
00:03:25 Like a stand.
00:03:28 Oh, yeah.
00:03:30 Yeah.
00:03:30 So it's like, it's a stand.
00:03:32 But for JoJo, it's a stand.
00:03:33 Duh.
00:03:34 Yeah.
00:03:35 Okay.
00:03:35 I think I know the lore behind the word stand.
00:03:38 It's because of the.
00:03:39 It's the Eminem song.
00:03:42 Yeah.
00:03:42 The Eminem.
00:03:43 Yeah.
00:03:43 Yeah.
00:03:45 Who's that?
00:03:46 I love Eminem.
00:03:47 There's dude, listen.
00:03:49 Listen, I'm white, so I cannot appreciate hip hop ever.
00:03:55 It's literally impossible.
00:03:58 Even when it's by a white guy.
00:04:00 Especially when it's by a white guy, because he's a fucking uncle Tom.
00:04:04 All right.
00:04:06 But when I was.
00:04:06 What was that mean?
00:04:07 Okay.
00:04:07 But in like, what does he mean?
00:04:11 Yeah.
00:04:12 I really like that song.
00:04:13 I didn't listen to Eminem or anything, but that song would come on the radio.
00:04:16 And I was like, oh, it's got that sample.
00:04:19 It's got that sample from that white guy.
00:04:23 It's got that non-hip hop sample that provides a bridge for understanding for me.
00:04:29 That song made me really sad.
00:04:30 I liked it.
00:04:31 Well, yeah, it's a good song.
00:04:33 You know, I was happy to see PCP member number 10, Jeff Thu, at the Crunchyroll Awards.
00:04:38 Oh, boy.
00:04:39 Representing our organization well.
00:04:41 It's nice to see how.
00:04:43 I mean, of course, Jeff would be there.
00:04:45 Of course.
00:04:45 I can't believe they let him give the the anime of the year award.
00:04:49 That was crazy.
00:04:49 That is that.
00:04:50 That's the top billing.
00:04:51 That is the top billing and they gave it to Jeff.
00:04:53 So clearly they're investing in his future, at least to a little bit.
00:04:57 The most Japan of all.
00:04:59 He loves Japan.
00:05:01 Period.
00:05:02 He's a guy that, you know, this was this.
00:05:04 This was fascinating to me.
00:05:05 Have you guys been watching Matt Pat's recent videos about like how
00:05:09 a company stole money from him and stuff?
00:05:11 Where he makes like extremely furiously, like his face stretches really angrily.
00:05:17 He's very funny.
00:05:17 I've been screenshotting his face.
00:05:19 Give us taken screenshots of his face during those videos.
00:05:22 Just posted them in the chat there.
00:05:24 He's just so mad.
00:05:25 We should put some in the show notes.
00:05:26 We should go back and find some if we can.
00:05:29 He's very mad.
00:05:30 He's extremely frustrated.
00:05:31 I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:05:33 OK, so Matt Pat recently, on his big video, Game Theory or whatever,
00:05:37 he made two videos now that are him basically calling out what he perceives at the very least
00:05:43 to be like underhanded and or shady business tactics by like large MCNs like the one that
00:05:49 he is signed to in particular.
00:05:51 Oh wait, wait, Matt Pat's having a problem with that?
00:05:54 Because I'm pretty sure he's signed to Studio 71.
00:05:58 Right?
00:05:59 OK, that is not the name.
00:06:00 Is that the one you were signed to, did you?
00:06:03 Yeah, because when I signed up for it, then they had like on the top of their website is
00:06:09 like Matt Pat, our main guy, and that was part of why I was why I signed up with them
00:06:13 because I just assumed that Matt Pat, the guy who everybody considers the YouTube guru,
00:06:18 would have picked the best MCN.
00:06:20 Oh yeah, I mean that's fair.
00:06:21 And it turns out that they fucked him over and he's really pissed.
00:06:24 Well, OK, I'm not so big a Studio 71.
00:06:26 I just don't think that's the that's definitely not the name he used and I can't fucking remember
00:06:31 what it is.
00:06:31 It could be a subsidiary company or whatever, you know.
00:06:34 That's definitely true.
00:06:35 But like what's, I'm sympathetic to his concerns and whatnot.
00:06:39 He feels ripped off specifically in that like, so he's signed up to an agreement where like
00:06:44 the money that he earns through AdSense on his channel gets delivered to this company first
00:06:49 then later gets paid out as is I think the standard procedure.
00:06:51 It's hard for me to have sympathy for Matt Pat, but it's even harder for me to have sympathy
00:06:56 for an MCN.
00:06:57 So I'm really torn here.
00:06:59 MCNs are evil.
00:07:00 They are all bad.
00:07:01 I have never heard a story of one being not bad and they don't do anything.
00:07:08 They litter because there's nothing they can do protections.
00:07:11 The only thing as far as they don't do that value.
00:07:13 No, they never did that because all they did the reason that people seem to think that
00:07:18 their MCNs were helping them with that the MCN just does the same thing that you yourself
00:07:22 are capable of doing.
00:07:23 Most people just don't know that.
00:07:25 Yeah, like the same steps that you consider that a valuable service.
00:07:29 Wait, what is this thing that you can do that they do for you?
00:07:34 I mean, they literally just like file counter notifications or like email the company and
00:07:38 try to get it fixed, but they have no more sway in doing that than you do as an individual.
00:07:43 Well, I mean, they might as a corporate entity, they might have more clout.
00:07:48 They do not.
00:07:50 Believe me, I know.
00:07:53 It's easier to just get your fans to email a company because then they get a lot of emails
00:07:59 and that will make them more likely to.
00:08:01 I mean, in these videos, that's like basically the only thing MatPat said is any value.
00:08:05 But as you said, it might just be again, nothing beyond what you can already do yourself.
00:08:09 But the reason I brought him up to begin with was just that like MatPat and Jeff,
00:08:15 okay, Jeff came from a marketing background or like a gaming journalism background before he
00:08:19 started his anime work.
00:08:20 And so he's got marketing on the mind from the very start of his channel,
00:08:25 which has helped him a lot and I'm not even bashing for it.
00:08:27 But the fascinating thing to me was to learn that MatPat here, I learned in his first video,
00:08:32 he just comes around and said this, maybe this was public knowledge, but I didn't know.
00:08:35 He straight up worked for an MCN before he started his channel game theory and like
00:08:42 worked on them in parallel.
00:08:43 And he just had the complete insider scoop as to how all this shit worked.
00:08:47 And I was like, well, no fucking wonder he's the guru of at least the YouTuber side guru
00:08:54 of like MCM and like knowledge about how to spread your company and optimal release schedules and
00:08:59 whatnot.
00:09:00 I guess nobody, I don't know, again, not to, I'm not shitting on either of them.
00:09:05 And it's not that they're worse or more inauthentic, but when you like lead with marketing,
00:09:10 I guess it just, it ebbs away at your like, you know, real gamerness and makes you feel
00:09:15 more corporatized, I guess.
00:09:17 Sure.
00:09:18 That's, that's all.
00:09:19 But I mean, I don't know, like it's, it's an interesting series of videos.
00:09:23 And it's like, I'm, MatPat is a very business savvy guy.
00:09:27 And it's surprising to me that he's getting as much traction as he is, considering like,
00:09:31 like his case for these things is like, he admits that like he signed an agreement with
00:09:36 these companies, Defy, defy is the name of the company, that like they would keep the money,
00:09:40 they'd pay him out later.
00:09:42 And he himself went out of his way to put himself in an even more like negative position
00:09:46 because of a specific request where they could like hold on to more of his money.
00:09:50 But like, but that's a side.
00:09:51 The 1.7 million is from like everybody signed with defy.
00:09:54 But like, after signing an agreement to put himself in this position, he is now after
00:09:59 the fact complaining that like business ventures have gone badly in this way.
00:10:05 And that like, while, while defy, excuse me, while defy, like made an investment or like
00:10:09 some bank made an investment in defy, that defy investment has gone away because defy
00:10:15 has folded up shop and gone under.
00:10:17 The bank is ally.
00:10:18 Thank you.
00:10:19 That's right.
00:10:20 Ally bank, like they invest in defy.
00:10:22 And so because the investment did not work out defy like overextended itself and failed
00:10:26 or whatever, it's understandable that ally bank not get their investment back.
00:10:32 But it's, but MatPat's claim is that it is not fair and not understandable that these
00:10:38 YouTubers signed to this MCM do not get their pay.
00:10:41 But I would argue that this is all tied up in like the legal agreements they made.
00:10:46 And so it's kind of hard for me to sympathize, especially with MatPat himself.
00:10:50 The leader of the bunch.
00:10:51 And you know him well.
00:10:52 The MCM contracts are extremely vague and they leave a lot of like, if you read it,
00:10:58 you should be able to recognize that and like know that you're going to get fucked.
00:11:03 Like this just takes me back to like when, when Ben faith sealed his fate by agreeing to work on,
00:11:10 you know, what?
00:11:10 Don't say it.
00:11:11 T.F.
00:11:12 Don't say it.
00:11:13 Don't say analysis.
00:11:13 Anarchy.
00:11:14 When he agreed to do that and I didn't, I was like, well, this is me making a better
00:11:19 decision. I know I'm right.
00:11:20 I have no sympathy.
00:11:21 And it's the same for everybody who's ever signed to an MCM.
00:11:25 I'm sitting over here being like, I've gotten offers.
00:11:27 I knew this was retarded.
00:11:28 So I didn't do it.
00:11:29 You made the mistake.
00:11:30 Listen, why am I supposed to feel bad for you?
00:11:32 Look, you, you don't look.
00:11:35 All right.
00:11:35 Yes.
00:11:36 I waited until midnight and I, and I, and I said Dr. Wolfe into my mirror three times
00:11:42 and he appeared and he reached out with the contract and I signed it in blood.
00:11:46 And I, you know, it was just, I was peer pressured is what I'm saying.
00:11:49 I was peer.
00:11:49 Okay.
00:11:50 Okay.
00:11:51 But me, I had social fortitude and I did not give in.
00:11:54 I guess is like, surely you expect like if you sign up to anything, you expect that
00:12:01 they will fuck you over if they can.
00:12:03 Like nobody's a good guy.
00:12:05 Whenever you want to like, like with studio 71, the way that they pitched themselves,
00:12:12 it's, it's crazy because they basically pitched themselves as like, oh, we are too good for you.
00:12:18 Cause like when I, the contract I signed was like, uh, we'll have you for one year minimum.
00:12:24 And then after that, basically depending on if we think that it's working out,
00:12:28 like if you're growing at a good enough rate, we keep you on.
00:12:32 But if you're, if we think you're not growing or like you're not really participating,
00:12:36 then we're going to cut you.
00:12:37 So that makes it out like, oh yeah, this is like a really, like they're really serious about you.
00:12:43 You know, they really want to, but then I signed up and they never
00:12:47 did a single thing for me the whole time.
00:12:49 And like after a year had passed, they were still taking my money because, you know,
00:12:54 basically their contract is just, we can just have you for us.
00:12:57 Like, yeah, a year is required, but then after that, uh, you know, it's up to us,
00:13:02 whether we cut you loose or not.
00:13:04 So they're just taking my money and doing nothing.
00:13:06 And so I had to like send them a number of very harshly worded emails
00:13:11 before I was able to end that relationship.
00:13:13 And I had to be like straight up cut me off because you are taking my fucking money.
00:13:18 Yeah, it took a while.
00:13:19 It took a lot of, because they kept being like, well, but we could, you know,
00:13:23 well, we could work something out.
00:13:25 Like, you know, let's talk about it.
00:13:27 And I'm like, it's already, you've taken so much of my money already.
00:13:31 Like you've already gone way past the point of reaching my trust completely.
00:13:35 There is no way I would work with you anymore.
00:13:37 You know,
00:13:39 So, you know, like to be fair, I understand that matpat is just like the leading voice here.
00:13:44 And he's using his platform for something that I suppose is fair.
00:13:47 If this was me and I had made the mistake of signing with an MCM,
00:13:50 I would want somebody like matpat to like be trying to get me my fair share of the money or whatever.
00:13:56 I don't know.
00:13:57 I guess like, please listen to the show and look at these fucking matpat faces.
00:14:02 They are just click through all the links down there, everybody.
00:14:05 Oh, he's, he's a, he's a treasure.
00:14:09 Where did you post them?
00:14:10 They're in the audio links there.
00:14:11 Click on the audio links, uh, chat down there.
00:14:14 And uh, you'll see.
00:14:16 Does he look a little like purple?
00:14:17 He's a little purple.
00:14:18 He died.
00:14:19 Okay.
00:14:19 He does not acknowledge in the video, but between these two,
00:14:21 he put a little purple schmutz in his hair.
00:14:24 Why?
00:14:24 It looks weird as fuck now that I've noticed it.
00:14:27 I don't know.
00:14:27 But as a guy who loves purple, I'm a little bit pissed that he's co-opting my color.
00:14:31 I, I, I was thinking, I was literally thinking of doing that exactly.
00:14:34 Can you ping me in the chat?
00:14:35 Because I'm the cop killer and I should have purple hair.
00:14:39 Well, I mean, now you'll be matpat too, so.
00:14:41 No, he fucked.
00:14:42 I guess.
00:14:43 Lame.
00:14:44 No, but you gotta, you gotta do black and white.
00:14:45 You gotta have a zebra hair.
00:14:47 Oh, that'd be cool.
00:14:48 You know, I mean, I'm already fucking gray.
00:14:50 I'm already graying at a, at an alarming pace.
00:14:52 So, uh, I guess I better just lean into it.
00:14:55 Graying could be a good look though.
00:14:56 Yeah, I don't know.
00:14:57 Yeah, I don't know.
00:14:58 They're worst things.
00:14:58 Oh.
00:14:59 Like being autistic, which I also am.
00:15:01 But I mean, the reason I brought that up was originally just because like,
00:15:04 Jeff reminded me, Jeff is matpat.
00:15:06 Uh, they're just the same guy and that's fine.
00:15:08 And that's fine.
00:15:09 Um, yeah, I don't know.
00:15:11 I don't, uh, Matpat doesn't have the same flaccidity.
00:15:13 He's more of a.
00:15:14 Flaccidity.
00:15:15 He's more of an animated character.
00:15:16 Okay, we were watching, I'm shout out to May for calling Jeff through the most
00:15:20 flaccid man alive during the live stream yesterday.
00:15:23 But what is worth, Victor's the one who came up with that one.
00:15:27 Oh, did he really?
00:15:28 Okay.
00:15:29 Jeff, I love you, but that is hilarious.
00:15:30 Victor called him Jeff Flaccid.
00:15:33 He looked.
00:15:37 Okay.
00:15:37 I can't tell the difference between Jeff and Arkada, by the way.
00:15:39 If you see them next to each other.
00:15:41 I don't know who Arkada is.
00:15:43 He's, he's matpat.
00:15:44 Go, go into the Crunchyroll Awards and at the very end, you can go to my video
00:15:48 upload of it.
00:15:49 I'm not watching the Crunchyroll.
00:15:50 No, just, just skip to the very end where everybody's on screen and like,
00:15:54 Arkada standing right behind Jeff and they look exactly the same.
00:15:57 Like they have the same haircut, same glasses, same face.
00:16:00 Who wears like the red like suit?
00:16:02 Yeah.
00:16:02 Yes.
00:16:02 That's him.
00:16:03 Oh, yeah.
00:16:04 He's like, he's like Jeff with a blonde ponytail.
00:16:06 I'm a little bit pissed.
00:16:07 You're in the same like doll maker, like character building program and you just
00:16:11 swap the hair.
00:16:11 Well, that's the thing.
00:16:12 He's not, no, he's not blonde anymore.
00:16:14 He now has the same hair as Jeff.
00:16:16 Like at the Crunchyroll Awards, they had the same color, hairstyle, everything.
00:16:20 Like they look exactly the same.
00:16:22 I suppose I respected that he, he dressed up in cosplayed as the manager.
00:16:27 From, from, as Jeff, one cosplay was Jeff Thu.
00:16:30 The other cosplay was manager from Zombie Lens Saga.
00:16:33 And I was like, damn it.
00:16:34 I just don't know what my, my looks are.
00:16:36 Oh, I love the better for Zombie Lens Saga.
00:16:38 I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch that show one of these days.
00:16:41 Anyway.
00:16:41 Watch it.
00:16:42 Oh my God.
00:16:43 You haven't watched the shame.
00:16:44 I will.
00:16:44 It looks really good.
00:16:46 I watched Digi's review and it was very informative,
00:16:49 but it looks worth my time at the very least.
00:16:51 Are we, uh, all right.
00:16:52 Are we off that topic?
00:16:53 Because I had something.
00:16:54 We're off, we're off it.
00:16:54 All right.
00:16:54 Well, speaking of, speaking of hair,
00:16:56 I want to tell you a story and I almost don't want to tell this,
00:16:59 but I think, I think by the time that this comes out,
00:17:03 I will have made peace with it.
00:17:04 I hope.
00:17:05 Okay.
00:17:05 You know, this will force me to make peace though.
00:17:07 I'll no longer have any choice.
00:17:08 All right.
00:17:09 So a couple of weeks ago, I was like,
00:17:11 all right, I need a fucking haircut.
00:17:14 So I fucking, I don't, I had cut my own hair.
00:17:17 I've been doing this for years.
00:17:19 So I took some buzzers and I went into the bathroom and I looked in the mirror
00:17:23 and I just like, I don't know.
00:17:25 I like, I liked the hair long in the back.
00:17:27 I liked it long on top and in front,
00:17:29 but the way it was like puffing out on the sides, it was bad.
00:17:33 So I just took it and I trimmed one side and I cut like one side short,
00:17:37 like quite short and I looked at it and I was like, I like it.
00:17:41 I took some pictures.
00:17:42 I put them in my discord.
00:17:43 People were like, hey, this is look, this is a good look for you.
00:17:46 I was like, okay, cool.
00:17:47 I was like, yeah.
00:17:48 So I got a little like short on the side cut.
00:17:50 It's nice.
00:17:50 It's neat.
00:17:52 So I go back and I look at it.
00:17:53 I take some like pictures from the side and I look at it and I examine it and I'm like,
00:17:56 sloppy, sloppy.
00:17:58 So I want to neaten it up.
00:18:00 So I go in.
00:18:01 Yeah.
00:18:01 So I go in with the, with the buzzers, right?
00:18:03 And I put it a little shorter and I just, and I start buzzing and I'm like,
00:18:06 oh, I can't see.
00:18:07 So I, I rig up a makeshift, a sort of, uh, oh God, what's a Rube Goldberg machine?
00:18:14 Yeah.
00:18:15 I use a USB cable to tie to the back of a mirror and I hang the mirror over the
00:18:21 shower door and I tie the other end to the, the shower handle so that it is hanging.
00:18:27 And then I stuff a lot of tissue paper behind it to tilt it at just such an angle so that
00:18:31 I can see the wall mirror and this hanging mirror reflect the side of my head so I can
00:18:35 get a good view.
00:18:36 And so I go in with the buzzers and I cut it short and I'm like, oh,
00:18:40 shit, that's a little too short.
00:18:41 That's a little too short.
00:18:42 And then I'm like, oh, shit.
00:18:44 Okay.
00:18:44 What do I do?
00:18:45 Got to clean this up.
00:18:46 And I'm like, wait a minute.
00:18:47 I got, I want to get, I want to get like a, I want this to be neat.
00:18:50 I want this to be neat.
00:18:50 I want this to look deliberate.
00:18:51 I don't want this to look like an accident.
00:18:53 Long story short, I grabbed my fucking razor and I shaved the entire side of my head bald.
00:18:57 So I just have a, so I just have a straight up Skrillex cut right now.
00:19:01 That's what I'm rocking.
00:19:02 And I'm going to be frank.
00:19:03 I don't like it.
00:19:04 I don't like it, but I think that I will like it.
00:19:07 I think that once it grows out, maybe like a quarter inch.
00:19:10 So it's not like bald.
00:19:12 I think once it grows out a little bit, I will be fine with it and like it again.
00:19:15 But right now.
00:19:16 I can't even picture you with this haircut you're describing.
00:19:19 I have it.
00:19:20 We all need to see.
00:19:22 Post image.
00:19:24 I think, oh God, it's really bad.
00:19:27 Look, you can get one later if you don't have it now.
00:19:29 I have one on my phone.
00:19:30 I will post one in a second.
00:19:31 Okay.
00:19:32 But the, the, the, the, the, so I have been, I have not left my room in several days without
00:19:39 putting a hat on.
00:19:41 I'm just waiting.
00:19:42 You're really proud of this haircut.
00:19:43 You can tell.
00:19:44 I'm wait, no, I told you, I don't like it.
00:19:47 I don't like, I don't like the way that it looks being like
00:19:49 completely bare on one side.
00:19:51 It's bizarre.
00:19:51 I look like a white nationalist.
00:19:53 I look like I'm going to go and, and curb stomps to minorities.
00:19:57 It triggers me just thinking about it.
00:19:59 Just looking at myself in the mirror.
00:20:00 I have a panic attack.
00:20:01 I watched the American history X the other day.
00:20:03 Excellent film.
00:20:03 Everyone should check it out.
00:20:06 Anyway, that's what I have to say.
00:20:07 I'm literally shaking.
00:20:11 Ben, was it worth saving the $14 or the $10 on a decent haircut
00:20:16 to, to do all this, to put yourself through this?
00:20:18 It was because if I had spent that $14, not only would I be out the $14,
00:20:24 I would have missed out on an experience, an adventure,
00:20:28 a negative experience, but an experience nonetheless.
00:20:33 That's true.
00:20:34 Hold on.
00:20:35 And now you'll grow as a person because of it.
00:20:37 Maybe.
00:20:38 I don't know.
00:20:38 No, Ben won't learn.
00:20:39 Ben won't change.
00:20:40 I'm not sure.
00:20:41 He won't evolve.
00:20:42 I'm going to try and post one of the pictures I took in the discord.
00:20:45 It looks bad.
00:20:46 Get ready to laugh.
00:20:47 Get ready to fucking laugh at me,
00:20:48 everyone.
00:20:49 I'm looking.
00:20:49 It's going to be, hold on.
00:20:50 Sorry.
00:20:51 It's, I'm gay.
00:20:53 Oh no.
00:20:54 Yeah.
00:20:56 Cut this out.
00:20:57 Cut this all out.
00:20:58 Oh, it looks so fucking shit, dudes.
00:21:01 It looks so fucking shit.
00:21:02 Well, I'm very excited to see that.
00:21:03 See, not only was this picture like it's bad and from a bad angle,
00:21:06 but also my hair was greasy because I hadn't showered at the time.
00:21:09 Well, there's your problem right there.
00:21:11 So I just look like, so I just look like fucking trash.
00:21:14 Well, good.
00:21:15 Here we go.
00:21:15 There it is.
00:21:16 There it is.
00:21:17 God, why have you done this?
00:21:19 No, it's fine.
00:21:20 It's, yeah.
00:21:21 I mean, you just look like, you just look like you go to art school.
00:21:25 Yeah.
00:21:25 That's, that's basically true.
00:21:27 It's good.
00:21:27 Well, the worst thing about this is that it's greasy.
00:21:29 When it grows out, when it's like a quarter inch long
00:21:31 and it looks like I have hair there, I will be fine with it.
00:21:34 Yeah.
00:21:34 It's actually less bad than I thought it was going to be.
00:21:37 Yeah.
00:21:37 Okay.
00:21:38 Well, thank you.
00:21:39 Yeah.
00:21:39 I don't know.
00:21:39 I'd like, I'd like cut the longness shorter elsewhere, I guess, but I don't know.
00:21:43 In the back.
00:21:44 Just like everywhere, I guess.
00:21:46 Especially the back, I suppose.
00:21:47 I like it long.
00:21:48 I like it long, though.
00:21:49 No, fair enough.
00:21:50 So that's my, that's my hair story.
00:21:54 This is why men invented money, Ben, so that you can have other people exchange
00:21:57 goods and services, in this case services, so that you cannot, you know.
00:22:00 Well, you know what, Nate?
00:22:01 Here's the thing.
00:22:02 Yeah.
00:22:03 I could go to a barber and get a professional cut, but you know what?
00:22:07 That would be an assembly line cut.
00:22:09 This is, this is an indie, this is an indie cut.
00:22:11 This is, this is a work of art, not necessarily a good one,
00:22:15 but this is a work of art.
00:22:16 This is unique.
00:22:17 This is a post-modern work of art, so yeah.
00:22:20 You know, sometimes I wonder what would happen if I was just, you know,
00:22:23 should I just shave all my hair off?
00:22:26 I did shave all my hair off in college one time.
00:22:29 And, well, the other, a while back, I had Munchie and Kazi and Crack and my friend,
00:22:35 John, we were all hanging out and I showed them fake pictures from my Facebook of me
00:22:39 when I had a shaved head and everyone agreed this is a bad look for you.
00:22:42 Don't do this again.
00:22:44 I was like, you're right.
00:22:45 Yeah, yeah.
00:22:45 I don't, I don't have a head shave.
00:22:46 You look like the lumberjack look.
00:22:47 That's, that's still the, like, literally, T-Bap Q&A, his peak bend look.
00:22:53 As it was peak Nate look.
00:22:54 Yeah.
00:22:54 And I'm, you know, I'm getting back to it because I'm growing the beard back.
00:22:57 And I'm looking.
00:22:58 Well, good.
00:22:58 That's good.
00:22:58 Also, I'm getting thinner.
00:23:00 I'm like, down to 100.
00:23:01 The beard's going a long way.
00:23:02 The beard's going a long way.
00:23:03 Both add a lot to this.
00:23:04 I'm down to 160 pounds.
00:23:06 That's great.
00:23:07 I like, I like.
00:23:07 Fuck, Ben weighs less than I do.
00:23:09 What's going on?
00:23:10 I like.
00:23:10 He's working it.
00:23:11 I like where things are going.
00:23:12 I like where things are going for, for old Ben Saint.
00:23:15 I agree.
00:23:16 I agree.
00:23:17 Yeah.
00:23:17 Good work.
00:23:18 Just need to up your gamer score and then you'll be just winning all aspects of life.
00:23:22 Well, one, the one area that I'm lacking in is that I have a shitty old phone that
00:23:26 grinds to a halt when I PVP in Pokemon Go.
00:23:29 So once I fix that, I will be perfect.
00:23:31 I will be, I will have achieved perfect cell stats.
00:23:34 What do you have?
00:23:34 What do you have right now?
00:23:35 Samsung Galaxy S5.
00:23:36 It's like six or seven years old.
00:23:38 Yeah.
00:23:38 Time to upgrade.
00:23:39 Time to upgrade that shit.
00:23:41 Well, that's the tale of Ben's hair and everyone mock him.
00:23:46 Please make meme edits of this.
00:23:47 Like, like put like Nazi tattoos on the skull.
00:23:49 Don't put, don't put this picture on the show notes.
00:23:51 Just like, don't put it.
00:23:52 We have to put it in the show notes.
00:23:54 You kidding me?
00:23:54 No, but it's Ben.
00:23:55 Yeah, we've been discussing it consistently for minutes.
00:23:58 Ben, they have to see it.
00:23:59 They have to.
00:24:00 It's too late.
00:24:00 You've revoked your rights.
00:24:01 I wish I'd taken a, I wish I'd taken a less greasy one.
00:24:05 If you want to take another less greasy one, we can replace this.
00:24:08 But if that doesn't show up, this is the one that's going out.
00:24:11 Okay.
00:24:11 So it's on you.
00:24:12 It's on you.
00:24:13 I will try and flatter this admittedly unflattering look.
00:24:17 As best I can.
00:24:17 Okay, good.
00:24:17 I want to see those beauty shots in the chat.
00:24:21 Yeah.
00:24:21 All right.
00:24:22 Listen, I went, I was out for community with, with Kazi yesterday.
00:24:26 I kept the hat on the whole time, just didn't, didn't acknowledge it.
00:24:29 Yeah.
00:24:30 Did she say anything?
00:24:31 Did she laid any mean remarks?
00:24:33 Well, there was a moment, there was a moment where I got scared and I started sweating.
00:24:38 When she was like, I heard you gave yourself a haircut.
00:24:40 Talking about the old one that I posted pictures of on the discord.
00:24:43 And I was like, oh, yeah, I did.
00:24:45 And she was like, oh, yeah, I was just wondering about that.
00:24:47 And I was like, oh, yeah.
00:24:48 Anyway, PVP, let's, let's battle Pokemon Go.
00:24:50 Deliberately doesn't take off hat.
00:24:52 Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
00:24:54 Yeah.
00:24:55 Um, so I've been, you've been lying to everyone.
00:24:57 I've been deceiving them.
00:25:02 Oh, but it's okay.
00:25:03 I know the truth has to come out at some point.
00:25:04 So it might as well come out here on the podcast in front of like.
00:25:07 It'll force you to adapt.
00:25:08 Thousands of people.
00:25:08 Accept it.
00:25:09 Yep.
00:25:10 Yep.
00:25:10 Yep.
00:25:10 That's good.
00:25:12 So what else is going on ladies and gentlemen?
00:25:14 Hi, I have a story, a small story.
00:25:17 I finally picked up pens and pencils after seven years of not drawing traditionally.
00:25:22 And I like it.
00:25:23 Oh no.
00:25:24 Is it good?
00:25:25 Have you lost skill?
00:25:27 I, I, I, I apparently I have, I have a, I have an art style that I didn't know I have.
00:25:33 Yeah.
00:25:33 It's really good.
00:25:34 And it's different from your usual stuff.
00:25:36 It's shaded really nice, but in a different, I mean your shading is usually pretty nice.
00:25:40 But there are any examples we could look at on like for the show notes on like Twitter.
00:25:43 So yeah, yeah.
00:25:44 Hold on.
00:25:44 The sense, it has a, you, you draw a very, it made your, I don't know,
00:25:49 something about the way you drew it with traditionally, it felt very dynamic.
00:25:52 Yeah.
00:25:53 It added dynamism.
00:25:55 Dynamism.
00:25:55 Dynamism.
00:25:57 It's your usual style.
00:25:58 I'm pretty sure you can just say dynamic.
00:26:00 It added dynamic too.
00:26:02 No, dynamism is when you died in NAMM.
00:26:06 And now you are an ism.
00:26:07 And you have a tism about it.
00:26:09 Yeah, exactly.
00:26:10 Oh yeah, it looks pretty cool.
00:26:11 I like it.
00:26:12 I like it.
00:26:12 I like, I like the hair.
00:26:13 I really like the way the hair looks.
00:26:15 Oh yeah, it's pretty good.
00:26:15 It's like a character from Spawn.
00:26:17 A little bit.
00:26:18 I dig the shading a lot.
00:26:20 I like characters with no mouths.
00:26:22 I generally find that I prefer.
00:26:24 Especially women.
00:26:25 Everyone's, I feel like I prefer everyone's traditional art over there digital.
00:26:30 Like when I see, I'm just more impressed when I see like a, you know,
00:26:35 it's just more of your, more of your mark comes through no matter what.
00:26:39 Like, that's true.
00:26:40 And especially in a case like say, I love Ben's Inktober drawings a whole lot.
00:26:46 Because when you look at the digital art he does, you can tell that he has drawn
00:26:51 the same line 8,000 times trying to get it exactly right.
00:26:55 Whereas when it's ink, like, I mean, I prefer thicker lines anyways.
00:26:58 So like having to go over the lines multiple times makes the picture cooler to me than it
00:27:03 would be if it was less rough.
00:27:05 When I did Ink, like two, two October's ago or three October's ago when I did all this,
00:27:09 a lot of people like those.
00:27:11 And I have all these Copic markers that I just don't fucking use.
00:27:14 That fucking, I always think that I should.
00:27:16 The fucking robot you drew was like the coolest thing you've ever drawn in that Inktober.
00:27:22 I didn't even, I colored that thing with like a red, like, not even a Copic.
00:27:28 I colored that with like a red, like, fine point like Sharpie.
00:27:33 And it came out really good somehow.
00:27:34 Is there a link to that we can put in the show notes?
00:27:36 Because that's cool too.
00:27:36 Just for comparison sake.
00:27:37 Yeah, I could find, I could find that.
00:27:39 Let me look.
00:27:39 Okay, all right.
00:27:40 I think my cat is very concerned about me doing traditional art.
00:27:45 Your cat is concerned?
00:27:46 Yeah, because I'm making noise and doing something he's not used to seeing me do.
00:27:50 Yeah, okay.
00:27:51 Is he causing any issues?
00:27:52 No, no, he's just, he's just looking at me with confusion and mulling at me.
00:27:57 It's just like, are you okay?
00:27:59 Hey, you know, on the subject of like, I don't know, doing artistic stuff a little differently
00:28:05 than normal, I was actually just proposed today.
00:28:07 I suppose I'll just say by one nexus mania, a guy I'm a big fan of and who also seems to like me,
00:28:14 he asked me if I wanted to do some like relatively professional voice acting work,
00:28:18 like with pay for like a pretty decent amount of like runtime and stuff.
00:28:23 And I was like, Nate, remember back to those youthful days when you really wanted to be
00:28:27 an anime voice actor.
00:28:29 And I was just like, so I told him like, I am interested.
00:28:32 Like if the script's bad, I'm not going to do it.
00:28:34 So like get back to me with more information and shit.
00:28:36 But I don't know, I really like nexus and I think it'd just be really cool.
00:28:42 And I'm kind of just excited to do more voice acting work stuff.
00:28:45 So, so here's my call out to everybody.
00:28:47 If you got projects that you want people to do voice acting work on and you think I'd be the man
00:28:51 for the job, fucking at me on Twitter and I will only do it for pay.
00:28:56 So I'm just letting you know right now.
00:28:57 You have to pay me whatever is an appropriate amount for my time.
00:29:01 I'm just going to warn you right now, Nate.
00:29:01 I know how much you love to hug those JKs,
00:29:04 but when you go to them conventions, you got to stay away.
00:29:08 Wait, what is it?
00:29:09 What is a JK?
00:29:11 That's a JK rolling.
00:29:13 It's a Japanese slang for high schoolers.
00:29:16 Joshi Kosei.
00:29:19 I totally knew that and wasn't pretending.
00:29:23 Okay, I get it.
00:29:24 I get what you're putting up.
00:29:26 Anyway, but yeah, I'm just saying like I've wanted to voice act.
00:29:29 People tell me I have a good voice.
00:29:30 You know, that's cool.
00:29:31 But it occurs to me that I haven't done much like like fictional character voice acting
00:29:37 outside of like like some t-baps skits for a while ago and more some more relatively recently,
00:29:42 as a matter of fact.
00:29:44 You know, speaking of voice acting, so I had to do.
00:29:47 Yeah, let me just finish my point.
00:29:48 It's just voice acting is a skill that I respect.
00:29:51 It is not just like talking into a microphone.
00:29:54 You have to inflect and get the right emotions captured and stuff.
00:29:57 So it's actually kind of exciting and I'm looking forward to opportunities to do so.
00:30:00 So, okay, that's it.
00:30:01 That's it.
00:30:01 All right, go on, Ben.
00:30:02 So I was, so I talked about the audiobook deal with Oolulilia and Oolulilia is dragon ass
00:30:11 because he's like, okay, we both had to make accounts on this site called ACX,
00:30:18 which is like sort of a gateway site to like iTunes and Audible and stuff.
00:30:22 And I made mine as the producer and he made his as an author and the idea is that he is supposed
00:30:27 to propose me a deal to like do like a split profit project thing where like I send him audio files
00:30:35 and he like accepts or denies them.
00:30:38 He did that.
00:30:39 He made the account and then he asked me like, how do I send you the request to do the thing?
00:30:44 And I was like, here's a guide.
00:30:46 Here's a full guide to like how an author should do this and like where to go.
00:30:50 And then he was like, yeah, it's pretty late.
00:30:53 And you know, I'm really addicted to Skyrim or oblivion or whatever right now.
00:30:57 So, you know, I might just get back to this later and I've been waiting for like a week,
00:31:01 maybe like a week now, maybe less than a week, but it's days.
00:31:04 And he just hasn't hit the one fucking button, the one fucking button.
00:31:09 He has to push to fucking make this thing go through.
00:31:13 Oolulilia, this is your, this is your, your one chance.
00:31:17 This is your one chance to fix this shit.
00:31:21 We bring down the full terror of the PCB.
00:31:23 Look, I don't know where he has to look because I'm not, I don't have his kind of account,
00:31:27 but there's just like one fucking button he has to push.
00:31:30 He just has to send me like one thing.
00:31:32 And I know the feeling.
00:31:33 He's probably just been busy and doesn't want to take the five minutes it's going to take to do it.
00:31:37 I get it.
00:31:37 I as a, as a, as a chronic ass-dragger myself, I get it.
00:31:41 I've seen what Elder Scrolls does to people and I'm not surprised that this is the outcome.
00:31:46 Anyway, here's that, here's that tweet.
00:31:48 Here's that, here's that robot drawing that I did.
00:31:50 Oh, okay, sick, sick.
00:31:52 Um, but anyway.
00:31:53 Oh, that's so cool.
00:31:55 Thank you.
00:31:55 It's like Amy Rose Gundam.
00:31:57 I really, I really like the, the, uh, what's it called?
00:32:02 Like with the, with the fires and like in the, on the ground and the-
00:32:05 Jet propulsion.
00:32:06 Yeah, yeah.
00:32:06 I bet it's like blasting off the ground.
00:32:08 Yeah, I really like that effect.
00:32:09 Yes.
00:32:10 I think, I like this.
00:32:11 Watch me tie this into current relevant topics because Ben, I believe you drew this
00:32:15 not long after reading volume one of Battle Angel Alita.
00:32:19 Oh, it looks like something from that.
00:32:23 I might, it was around that time.
00:32:25 But wait, now there's a live action film adaptation.
00:32:28 Before we, I will, we'll talk about that, although I haven't seen it.
00:32:31 But before we say that, I just want to say that on the voice acting, I had to do voices
00:32:35 for the different characters in Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters.
00:32:39 And one of the things that I'm very unsure about and very like,
00:32:41 not sure what the best thing to do about it is the book is written like a screenplay
00:32:46 and you, it'll, it'll say like character's name and then the dialogue.
00:32:50 It doesn't have like, you know, John said, Knuckles said, Steve said.
00:32:54 And I'm not sure whether it would be, like I tried to just do the voices so that you
00:32:59 could tell who was doing who.
00:33:01 I don't know if I could differentiate them enough.
00:33:03 I don't know.
00:33:04 Like I'm wondering if I should bite the bullet and like say their name.
00:33:09 You know, like say like, you know, Tyler.
00:33:10 That's a good question for him to clarify.
00:33:13 Well, I don't, I don't necessarily trust his judgment.
00:33:16 Okay.
00:33:17 Okay.
00:33:17 Fair enough.
00:33:18 I don't know.
00:33:19 Yeah, you'll have to make a call there.
00:33:20 That's, that's interesting though.
00:33:21 I might like listen back to it and be like, kind of like, is it distinct enough?
00:33:25 Do you, can you tell when two is talking or when our science teacher is talking?
00:33:30 Remember our boy, name I can't remember, guy who did all the Harry Potter books.
00:33:34 Who, you know.
00:33:35 Yes.
00:33:35 Um, um, not, not, not really the trees.
00:33:38 He did the, he did Game of Thrones audiobooks.
00:33:40 Um, I can't remember.
00:33:41 My mom like loved him more than my father.
00:33:44 She ever loved him.
00:33:47 Jim Hennig.
00:33:47 No, I can't remember whoever that guy was.
00:33:50 He, he knocked it out of the park and he did a great job differentiating like every voice.
00:33:55 Jim Dale.
00:33:55 Jim Dale.
00:33:56 Jim Dale.
00:33:57 That's the guy.
00:33:57 That's the guy.
00:33:59 Stephen Fry.
00:33:59 Actually Stephen Fry did narrate them the, in the UK,
00:34:02 but Jim Dale narrated the USA version.
00:34:04 I wonder why.
00:34:05 What they do differently.
00:34:06 Well, whatever.
00:34:07 Anyway.
00:34:09 Oh, Harry.
00:34:10 Oh, Harry.
00:34:12 Harry.
00:34:12 No.
00:34:13 Cool.
00:34:16 That was the Ron line.
00:34:18 The classic Ron line.
00:34:19 Just whenever anyone says cool, the way he says it is cool.
00:34:23 And it's great.
00:34:24 It's not even bad.
00:34:25 It's good.
00:34:25 Yeah.
00:34:26 It's just good.
00:34:26 Um, okay.
00:34:27 But anyway, when, when Hermione says Harry, she says,
00:34:30 Harry, oh, Harry, oh, Harry.
00:34:35 What do you, what do you fuck?
00:34:36 It's good.
00:34:36 It's good.
00:34:37 How does Stephen Fry say, say, cool?
00:34:39 Does he say the same thing, Gib?
00:34:41 Did you listen to that?
00:34:42 Well, yeah, I did listen to those.
00:34:44 I just don't know how, like, I can't, I mean, I can't remember.
00:34:47 Look it up now, Gib.
00:34:47 It probably wasn't nearly, it probably wasn't nearly as distinctive.
00:34:51 Yeah.
00:34:52 Is Jim Dale American?
00:34:54 No, he's British.
00:34:55 He's British too.
00:34:56 I don't think so.
00:34:56 Okay.
00:34:56 So then, yeah.
00:34:57 They just got two different British guys
00:34:59 to do the American versus like British dub of the same story.
00:35:03 Although, I mean, so I know in Britain, like the first one was
00:35:05 called the Philosopher's Stone or whatever.
00:35:07 Is there like actual translation?
00:35:09 Like, or like localization differences or something?
00:35:11 You know what I think?
00:35:12 About the book?
00:35:12 I don't know.
00:35:13 Yeah, in the book.
00:35:14 Wouldn't think so.
00:35:15 Don't they call it the Philosopher's Stone in the book?
00:35:17 I think in the early books, there were some like, like,
00:35:20 name convention changes made for the American versions.
00:35:23 Why the fuck did they call it the Sorcerer's Stone?
00:35:25 Why isn't the goddamn Philosopher's Stone,
00:35:27 that's a staple fantasy item?
00:35:29 You know what?
00:35:30 I'm over it.
00:35:31 I've been thinking about this for 20 years.
00:35:32 I assume that there was some kind of religious connotation
00:35:35 to Philosopher's Stone.
00:35:36 Oh, you think so?
00:35:37 Maybe.
00:35:37 I don't think so.
00:35:39 It's like demonic or something and they like.
00:35:41 It's a philosophy.
00:35:42 I mean, Philosopher is like, it's not like, I mean,
00:35:46 sorcery is more magical than Philosopher.
00:35:49 That is, I mean, that's totally, totally true.
00:35:51 Totally like more objective.
00:35:53 Those books were protested by religious people
00:35:55 who didn't like witchcraft in America.
00:35:57 It's very possible that it's just that they thought kids
00:36:00 would not pick up a book called Philosopher's Stone,
00:36:03 but they might pick up one called Sorcerer's Stone.
00:36:04 I read an article online.
00:36:08 About like, you know, like people being like,
00:36:10 Harry Potter is demonic.
00:36:12 You know, everyone's fucking falling into devil witchcraft.
00:36:15 Thought it was real for a long time.
00:36:17 Turned out it was an onion article
00:36:19 that had been passed around as the genuine thing.
00:36:21 And it made me fucking mad because I thought it was real.
00:36:23 I was like, oh, so no one understands.
00:36:25 It's not, I love Harry Potter.
00:36:28 There have been books.
00:36:29 I remember researching this for like an,
00:36:31 for an essay during my time at uni.
00:36:34 Like I researched like books that are like on Amazon
00:36:40 detailing how Harry Potter is demonic.
00:36:44 And then you can buy it.
00:36:45 And I didn't, I didn't, I decided this was stupid
00:36:49 and I wanted to do something else.
00:36:51 But I saw it.
00:36:52 It's strange.
00:36:53 Okay. So some people think it or whatever reason.
00:36:55 Yeah. Yeah.
00:36:57 That lady that claimed that like Pokemon Go was demons.
00:37:01 Yeah.
00:37:02 Summoning demons or whatever.
00:37:04 And like they sexually blessed her in her sleep.
00:37:07 Whoa, what the fuck?
00:37:08 Whoa, okay.
00:37:09 That's a new twist on an old classic.
00:37:10 Oh, because it like appeared on top of her or something.
00:37:12 Yeah.
00:37:15 She got the game.
00:37:16 She turned it on.
00:37:17 AR mode was on.
00:37:18 There was a Pokemon in her room.
00:37:19 She screamed.
00:37:24 I feel like that's the next,
00:37:25 that could easily be the next, you know, thing.
00:37:29 Like.
00:37:29 Next Me Too movement.
00:37:30 Yeah.
00:37:31 We got Pokemon Molestation.
00:37:33 So I wonder if like in a lot of these cases,
00:37:37 I don't feel like people come to the conclusion
00:37:39 that a thing is witchcraft.
00:37:41 I feel like they hear somehow in the ether,
00:37:44 someone putting forth that,
00:37:45 and then they just also decide to believe it themselves.
00:37:49 I mean, not to be overly edgy,
00:37:51 but I do believe religion is largely linked
00:37:54 with straight up stupidity.
00:37:55 So, you know, we're just gonna throw that out there.
00:37:58 To anybody who believes one,
00:37:59 I'm likely to think is pretty deep into the other,
00:38:01 or has been deeply misled, you know.
00:38:03 Dude, I'm big into the stupidity fandom.
00:38:07 Dude, I love Jesus' style.
00:38:13 All right, whatever.
00:38:15 I didn't have much to say about Battle Angel Alita,
00:38:18 because I haven't seen the movie,
00:38:20 but I have read the book.
00:38:20 A friend of mine saw it and was saying good things.
00:38:23 He said it was fun, not necessarily good,
00:38:25 but a very fun watch,
00:38:27 and everyone had a good time and laughed a lot.
00:38:29 So.
00:38:29 Okay.
00:38:30 Oh, so I have.
00:38:31 Don't know if that's what they were going for.
00:38:33 Yeah.
00:38:33 Yeah.
00:38:35 I would say.
00:38:35 I have read the, uh, sorry.
00:38:37 Now, now you can talk about the movie.
00:38:38 I would just say that, like, uh,
00:38:40 because I did see, I made a video about it already.
00:38:42 Her eyes are really big, you guys.
00:38:44 I thought that was cool.
00:38:46 I think that was, I like that.
00:38:47 If you think that's cool, you'll love it.
00:38:49 Like, yeah.
00:38:49 I'm just wondering, in universe,
00:38:51 like, humans don't look like that,
00:38:53 so who made the choice to make this girl look like an anime?
00:38:56 Well, she's a doll, so she's got big doll eyes.
00:38:58 Yeah, she's not.
00:38:59 She's a robot.
00:39:01 But someone artistically, in universe,
00:39:03 decided to make her look doll-like and not like a normal human.
00:39:07 Someone made that choice, right?
00:39:08 Or maybe there was a technological limitation.
00:39:11 Well, he just kind of finds her head in the garbage.
00:39:13 So, like, she already looks like that at the start.
00:39:16 But, um, but yeah.
00:39:18 Is she a curiae, or like she was human,
00:39:19 and then, like, gets her body.
00:39:21 She has, her brain is human.
00:39:23 So, like, is that the case in the manga?
00:39:26 Does she have a human brain in the manga?
00:39:27 I think so, yeah.
00:39:30 I read the first, I only read the first volume.
00:39:33 When my friend John saw it, and the first thing I asked him was,
00:39:36 do you see a giant robot man fucking crack people's skulls open,
00:39:40 like chestnuts, and slurp their brains out of their skull holes,
00:39:44 like ice cream scoops?
00:39:45 And he said no, and I was like, well.
00:39:47 It is a PG-13 movie, but there is some intense violence
00:39:51 that happens in it for being PG-13, and it's dark,
00:39:54 just as dark as the, I mean, if you've seen the original OVA,
00:39:58 like, literally everything that happens in it is also in the movie.
00:40:02 So it's like a huge spoiler to even go watch the OVA.
00:40:05 But, uh, yeah, it's, it's a, I think you'll,
00:40:08 I think you will enjoy it.
00:40:09 If you think that her eyes look cool, you'll enjoy the movie.
00:40:13 I think, well, I think they look weird,
00:40:15 but I think that that's intentional, and it makes sense,
00:40:17 and I don't mind it, you know?
00:40:19 That's the way, that's the right way to do it.
00:40:21 I read the manga of that, the first two volumes, I think,
00:40:26 when I was 12, and it was like the edgiest, like, deadliest,
00:40:31 there were boobies in it, there was blood, there was killing,
00:40:34 it was like, oh, oh, oh no!
00:40:37 There's a scene, I read it, I borrowed it from you, Digi,
00:40:41 and I read it at your house, and I remember the scene,
00:40:43 it's like, the guy, the robot guy, he's done that,
00:40:45 he's holding like a woman, and he's, and he's bitten her head open,
00:40:48 and just like, slurped her brain out, and Alita like,
00:40:51 is jumping at him to attack him, and he just like,
00:40:54 tosses this like, body at her, and she's like tumbling,
00:40:58 and she's like tumbling through the end, like her dead eyes,
00:40:59 or like, and her like, head is like, open,
00:41:02 and she's naked in her hairs, and I was like,
00:41:04 I was like, so chilled, I was like, so chilled by this image,
00:41:07 and even thinking about it now.
00:41:08 When I think about it, it's funny, because like,
00:41:10 I've seen the OVA a bunch of times over the years,
00:41:13 and read the first volume of the manga,
00:41:14 and my impression of it was always just like,
00:41:16 Mad Max, Violence, Madness, you know,
00:41:18 it's just 80s, 80s, Violence, Dijour,
00:41:21 so that's kind of how I painted it in my video about the movie,
00:41:23 but then like, fans of the manga were all like,
00:41:26 swarming me like, no, it is absolutely about the story,
00:41:30 it's not just violent craziness,
00:41:31 you just got to get like, three or four volumes in,
00:41:35 or whatever, and then it's like, oh,
00:41:36 it's just this masterpiece of storytelling and artwork,
00:41:39 and I was like, maybe it becomes that.
00:41:40 All right, I guess, I mean,
00:41:42 definitely the early volumes are definitely
00:41:44 just Mad Max insanity, but, sure, sure.
00:41:47 You know, so I guess,
00:41:48 I mean, if their goal is to adapt the OVA to live action,
00:41:52 then if it did that.
00:41:53 I mean, they added in definitely a lot of plot points
00:41:55 from later into the manga to just explain things more,
00:41:58 because the OVA is just like,
00:42:00 basically two random disconnected stories
00:42:02 from the manga, from early on,
00:42:04 that like, don't really give you much of a sense of the world,
00:42:07 or like, what's, like, it doesn't really give you a sense
00:42:09 of the idea that there is more to it,
00:42:12 whereas the movie adds in a lot of detail
00:42:14 that gives you the sense that there's a lot more going on,
00:42:16 and they leave it very open for a sequel as well.
00:42:20 So is, I've been hearing, I've been hearing people say this,
00:42:22 and I forget if you went into this in any detail,
00:42:24 but like, is this the first non-horrible, like,
00:42:28 anime adaptation?
00:42:29 Speed Racer!
00:42:30 Oh, okay, I forgot Speed Racer.
00:42:32 Nate, didn't we watch Speed Racer, like, together
00:42:36 when we were, like, in high school or something?
00:42:37 I don't remember if we watched it together.
00:42:39 I think I remember watching it in the basement.
00:42:41 That's possible, I remember loving it.
00:42:43 I loved it, yeah.
00:42:44 It was dope as hell.
00:42:45 I loved it.
00:42:46 It's my favorite movie.
00:42:47 It's so fun.
00:42:49 And then I found out later that it was, like, you know,
00:42:52 a sort of, it was sort of unpopular with, like, a lot of people.
00:42:55 It was totally panned.
00:42:56 It was entirely panned.
00:42:58 And I was shocked.
00:42:59 You just get ready for it, I don't think.
00:43:00 But I only found this out at, like,
00:43:02 I think it was Egoraptor was defending it or something,
00:43:04 or some people were saying, like, this movie's,
00:43:07 like, when I, the time that I heard that the movie was maligned,
00:43:10 it was when I heard people saying,
00:43:11 this movie is unfairly maligned,
00:43:13 and actually it's great in a masterpiece,
00:43:14 and I was like, hey, I didn't know anyone was panning it,
00:43:17 but good on you.
00:43:18 Good.
00:43:18 Thanks for defending this movie.
00:43:20 I didn't know it was being attacked.
00:43:21 I had heard nothing positive about it until Egoraptor,
00:43:25 and then, and Film Crit Hulk then said it was, like,
00:43:28 one of his favorite movies.
00:43:29 And when I read his review,
00:43:30 it's what inspired me to go watch it.
00:43:31 And I was like, holy fuck, this is the best movie ever.
00:43:34 Yeah, everyone should definitely watch it immediately,
00:43:36 especially if you're an anime fan at all.
00:43:37 I definitely think, well,
00:43:38 the thing is a lot of fans of Speed Racer hate the movie
00:43:41 because it's not an accurate Speed Racer movie, per se.
00:43:46 How many of those are left from the fucking 50s?
00:43:47 Who is a fan of original Speed Racer?
00:43:50 How many?
00:43:50 Yeah, exactly.
00:43:52 You know, it's fine.
00:43:52 I totally get it.
00:43:53 I'm sure there's a great lore, and it, you know,
00:43:56 I would absolutely be the kind of guy who would be
00:43:59 ragging on the movie for not being a good enough adaptation
00:44:03 if I was a fan of Speed Racer,
00:44:05 which I've never seen in my life.
00:44:07 So I totally sympathize with that,
00:44:09 but what we have is just so good on its own.
00:44:11 Here's the thing.
00:44:12 The original Speed Racer is like a landmark moment
00:44:16 in animation and cartoons generally,
00:44:19 and it's like a cultural touchstone.
00:44:21 It doesn't need defending, you know?
00:44:23 Yeah, that's true.
00:44:24 It doesn't need advocates, it's fine.
00:44:26 And the new movie, its strengths are very different
00:44:31 from the strengths of the original Speed Racer,
00:44:33 like that, whatever, that revolutionized anime
00:44:35 or something, whatever.
00:44:36 By new, you mean like 10 years old.
00:44:38 Sure, yeah.
00:44:40 Wait, are you talking about the new movie
00:44:41 or the original animation?
00:44:42 I'm talking about the Speed Racer movie.
00:44:44 It's like 12 years old.
00:44:46 Yeah, yeah.
00:44:47 I mean, I was gonna, like, but the original,
00:44:49 what it's got, its strength, it's got its own story.
00:44:51 This new one is like a visual masterpiece,
00:44:55 like the feeling of like-
00:44:56 It is a camp, it is a camp feast, extravaganza.
00:45:00 And I just don't think that, like,
00:45:02 at all was what hardcore Speed Racer fans
00:45:04 like were into Speed Racer original for.
00:45:07 So like, it's a totally different-
00:45:08 Not at all.
00:45:09 So I could see them being not happy with that,
00:45:11 but for those of us who never gave a shit
00:45:12 about Speed Racer, particularly to begin with,
00:45:14 you know, we can be less biased.
00:45:16 I will add as well that while Speed Racer and Alita
00:45:18 might be the only two good, like, Hollywood
00:45:22 live-action anime adaptations,
00:45:23 there are tons of good live-action anime from Japan,
00:45:27 like where they just, you know,
00:45:28 they make tons of live-action adaptations.
00:45:31 I always wanted to see the Death Note ones that I hear are good.
00:45:32 The Death Note ones are not that good, I would not-
00:45:34 I want to tell us, it's like, is there a
00:45:37 live-action attack on Titan?
00:45:38 Is it good, if it exists?
00:45:40 There is one.
00:45:41 I don't know if it's good.
00:45:42 I like the live-action Rony Kenshin movies.
00:45:46 Kashern has a really interesting one.
00:45:48 I mean, there's tons.
00:45:49 I was just looking at lists,
00:45:50 and there's just like an endless sea
00:45:52 of live-action anime adaptations.
00:45:54 Stuff that I would never have imagined,
00:45:56 like in Tama, has like a live-action film.
00:45:58 Like, there's all kinds of shit.
00:45:59 My friend who saw Alita yesterday,
00:46:01 he said that he said,
00:46:03 like, everyone in the theater was laughing.
00:46:05 And so-
00:46:05 So that doesn't sound good.
00:46:06 That sounds bad.
00:46:07 It doesn't sound good.
00:46:07 I don't think that the movie is a-
00:46:10 Is it funny?
00:46:10 I mean, it's a Robert Rodriguez movie.
00:46:12 Like, they're all cheesy on purpose.
00:46:14 They're always like, you know,
00:46:16 so the movie is extremely fucking corny.
00:46:20 But like, you don't get the sense
00:46:21 that it doesn't know that.
00:46:23 Now, it's not all in a good way,
00:46:25 because like, a lot of the side actors
00:46:27 are fucking terrible.
00:46:28 Like, there's plenty of like villains
00:46:30 who's just acting is so bad
00:46:32 that it is cringe-worthy.
00:46:34 And sometimes Alita's facial expressions
00:46:35 get really uncanny or the dialogue is-
00:46:38 Like, sometimes the dialogue is really corny
00:46:41 and you could tell it's on purpose,
00:46:42 but you hate it anyways.
00:46:43 And other times it's corny,
00:46:45 but it works and it's fun.
00:46:47 But like, if you go into it with the mindset
00:46:50 that like, this is a movie I can laugh at
00:46:52 and that is fine,
00:46:54 then you will probably have a good time with it.
00:46:56 Yeah, all right.
00:46:57 I could see myself-
00:46:58 I mean, my instincts are like,
00:46:59 okay, I'm ready for Ghost in the Shell Zero here.
00:47:02 Let's, you know, ramp up-
00:47:03 It's a lot better than-
00:47:05 How do you guys feel?
00:47:06 I feel a little gross
00:47:09 when I see that it's an American adaptation.
00:47:12 Like, I, like,
00:47:13 I mean, I haven't seen the movie,
00:47:14 I don't know if it's good personally,
00:47:15 but like, the way they did,
00:47:18 they did the American remake
00:47:20 of fucking Ghost in the Shell.
00:47:22 They did the American remake of Old Boy.
00:47:24 Now they did this American version
00:47:26 of Battle Angel Alita.
00:47:27 I hate that shit.
00:47:29 On principle, I hate it.
00:47:30 It makes me feel dirty.
00:47:31 It's gross.
00:47:31 I want to see fucking Japanese people
00:47:34 in these fucking-
00:47:35 Ordinarily, ordinarily, I would avoid these movies.
00:47:38 Like, I didn't see Ghost in the Shell
00:47:39 or the American Old Boy,
00:47:41 but like, the thing about those movies
00:47:43 is that they were clearly like studio movies
00:47:47 with like an attached director
00:47:48 where it was just about like using an IP.
00:47:51 With this case, James Cameron
00:47:53 has wanted to make this movie for an eternity.
00:47:55 And like, he's clearly just a huge fan
00:47:58 of Battle Angel Alita
00:48:00 and he like worked with Robert,
00:48:02 you know, Robert Rubio directed it,
00:48:03 but he worked with him on it
00:48:04 and like, I think James Cameron even co-wrote it
00:48:07 and like, when you watch it, like I said,
00:48:09 if, I'm sure Cameron was mostly a fan of the old OVA
00:48:13 because it is visually really distinctive
00:48:16 and has super memorable moments in it.
00:48:18 So I think that like, literally every second
00:48:22 of the OVA, practically, is in the movie.
00:48:24 Like, it's so accurate that it's,
00:48:27 it might as well have used it as like a storyboard,
00:48:29 you know, and then everything they added in
00:48:31 is stuff from the manga.
00:48:32 So like, it, and none of the people
00:48:35 who have read the manga seem to have any problem
00:48:37 with the story or the way it's told.
00:48:38 And like, it's also not a story about Japanese people.
00:48:42 It's set in like a melting pot post-apocalypse,
00:48:46 you know, world where there's people of all races.
00:48:49 And like, Christoph Waltz plays Doc Edo
00:48:52 and he looks exactly like him.
00:48:54 Like, it's, I was like, oh my God.
00:48:57 Like, yes, that was exactly who they should get
00:48:59 to play this role.
00:49:00 It's perfect.
00:49:01 And he does a great job, of course,
00:49:03 because he's Christoph Waltz,
00:49:04 but most of the acting is pretty fucking terrible.
00:49:08 I mean, fair enough.
00:49:09 Fair enough.
00:49:10 Also, I want to clarify that I know Old Boy is Korean,
00:49:12 not Japanese.
00:49:13 It is based on a manga, though.
00:49:15 Or I don't know.
00:49:16 Oh, really?
00:49:16 I had no idea.
00:49:17 I think it's based on a manga.
00:49:19 I think it's actually based on a Japanese manga.
00:49:21 Let me look it up.
00:49:22 Okay.
00:49:23 Well, that's cool.
00:49:23 I mean, either way, the movie, you know,
00:49:26 but that's the thing, that's the thing.
00:49:27 Let's just say that it's a,
00:49:28 let's say it's a Japanese manga.
00:49:30 Yeah, it is.
00:49:30 It is, in fact, a Japanese manga that's based on it.
00:49:32 Okay.
00:49:33 So that's interesting.
00:49:33 Because like, okay, what right does,
00:49:35 let's just say for, I mean,
00:49:36 I don't believe in this kind of division stuff, necessarily.
00:49:40 I see the point of like,
00:49:42 if you're telling a Japanese story,
00:49:43 like about Japanese people,
00:49:45 like, you know, about Japanese lore
00:49:47 or current politics or any of that stuff,
00:49:49 then like, it seems pretty logical
00:49:51 to like make it with Japanese actors and whatnot.
00:49:54 But like, are Koreans so similar to Japanese?
00:49:57 The Asians all fucking hate each other,
00:49:59 as I understand it.
00:50:01 Yeah, I guess so.
00:50:02 So I mean, what is what more important,
00:50:04 like the artistry that the new people like bring to it
00:50:07 and if they honor like, you know, what's,
00:50:09 because Old Boy is like one of the most beloved movies
00:50:11 of all time, by like, film buffs.
00:50:13 I mean, Old Boy is by far the most egregious,
00:50:15 because like, there's already a live action movie.
00:50:18 It didn't need a remake, like Ghost in the Shell
00:50:20 and Alita don't have live action versions.
00:50:22 So I guess, yeah, it's as fair game for an American
00:50:25 to make as an Asian or whatever.
00:50:27 And then you just judge on like, how it came out.
00:50:29 I'd say.
00:50:29 Yeah.
00:50:30 Yeah.
00:50:31 But like...
00:50:32 And the Death Note.
00:50:32 The, the, the...
00:50:33 Oh yeah, that's true.
00:50:35 I haven't, I haven't seen Death Note, but like,
00:50:37 I don't know, but just when I see,
00:50:38 when I see a manga or something that's played by,
00:50:42 I see a white person playing light Yagami,
00:50:44 I'm like, oh God, I want to fucking barf, you know?
00:50:47 Yeah.
00:50:48 I have a visceral reaction to it.
00:50:49 I just realized like, Death Note kind of pulled
00:50:52 like Dragon Ball Z live actions.
00:50:54 She's like, they just put it in high school.
00:50:56 Uh.
00:50:57 Oh yeah, Dragon Ball Z too.
00:50:58 Well, I mean, Gohan was in high school
00:51:00 for parts of Dragon Ball Z.
00:51:01 So I, you know, maybe they're going to lean into that.
00:51:04 Sure.
00:51:04 I don't know.
00:51:05 Sure.
00:51:06 He was Dragon Ball Z set in high school?
00:51:09 When Go, after Cell was defeated and Gohan...
00:51:11 No, no, not the anime.
00:51:12 I mean, the, the...
00:51:13 The live action adaptation.
00:51:15 The remake.
00:51:15 Was there a Canadian, right?
00:51:16 It was a Canadian?
00:51:17 I don't, I don't remember.
00:51:18 I just remember he went to high school and, and stuff.
00:51:22 I mean, the fact of the matter is,
00:51:24 I don't think anyone would complain about any of these cases
00:51:26 if the movies were good.
00:51:28 Like, nobody would care if it was a white guy
00:51:29 if it was a great movie.
00:51:31 Light Yagami was literally a high school student.
00:51:34 And like, if you adapt it, you could,
00:51:35 as they chose to do in the, in the Netflix version,
00:51:37 you could lean into him being like a high school student.
00:51:40 But Light Yagami was never defined by that,
00:51:43 or like, his like weird crush they gave.
00:51:45 Okay, hang on.
00:51:46 Let me finish my point.
00:51:47 Light Yagami was like a borderline sociopathic,
00:51:51 obvious God complex narcissist,
00:51:53 who was so much better than the people around him
00:51:57 and was actually, so this was not a delusion
00:51:59 that like, he felt it was his God given right
00:52:03 to judge who should live and who should die.
00:52:05 This is not the kind of fucking character
00:52:07 as depicted in the original stories
00:52:09 who waste his time chasing pussy.
00:52:11 He doesn't give a shit.
00:52:12 He could get any pussy he wants
00:52:14 because he's so fucking competent
00:52:16 and he does consistently.
00:52:18 So to paint him that way, well, with Misa Misa,
00:52:21 she's like a, she's like an idol.
00:52:22 It is implied.
00:52:23 He doesn't even like her.
00:52:25 Well, okay, but
00:52:26 the point, he's above that.
00:52:28 He's above worrying about that.
00:52:29 And he could get any girl he wanted
00:52:30 because the girls were constantly
00:52:32 fawning over him when he was in college, especially.
00:52:34 Absolutely, sure.
00:52:35 And look at what's her face from after L dies
00:52:37 and there's the time skip.
00:52:38 There's that like newscaster
00:52:39 who also falls in love with him.
00:52:41 He gets like the cream of the crop is my point.
00:52:43 Like all the top sluts want Yagami's cock real bad
00:52:46 in addition to the lowly gutter sluts as well.
00:52:50 What's your point in all this?
00:52:51 My point is, what is wrong with the adaptation
00:52:54 is that they misunderstood and I mean,
00:52:56 I would argue maybe they understood,
00:52:58 but they made bad changes to the character
00:53:00 as opposed like you could make light Yagami American
00:53:03 that would come with baggage that you have to adapt it
00:53:05 to like the American political system
00:53:07 and the American policing system
00:53:08 that are different from Japanese
00:53:10 and are integral to the story.
00:53:11 What white light, white light.
00:53:14 That's a funny name for him.
00:53:15 White light, white light's first kill with the death note.
00:53:18 Trump, he just writes Donald Trump in the death note.
00:53:23 First thing.
00:53:24 I mean, yeah, yeah.
00:53:27 Oh, never mind.
00:53:28 I thought there was a live action Yu-Gi-Oh! movie
00:53:30 for a second, but it was just.
00:53:31 You know, they're making the second death note movie
00:53:33 for Netflix though, right?
00:53:35 Do you remember that?
00:53:35 No, no.
00:53:36 Geez.
00:53:37 At least, I've got to double check that
00:53:38 because I think that's true.
00:53:39 Apparently, I'm looking at the list of all of the
00:53:43 live action adaptations of manga and from the US,
00:53:47 there's not as many as I would have thought.
00:53:49 You've got Alita, the Giver,
00:53:51 which they made two of back in the early 90s.
00:53:53 I remember that.
00:53:53 Death Note, Dragon Ball Evolution,
00:53:55 Fist of the North Star, which I don't know.
00:53:58 Yeah, Death Note 2 is in the works at Netflix for some reason.
00:54:01 Ghost in the Shell, Old Boy, Speed Racer,
00:54:03 and then I see TBA on Akira,
00:54:07 which has been in the works for an eternity,
00:54:09 and Naruto.
00:54:11 Yes.
00:54:12 So a Naruto live action is, I guess, on my way.
00:54:15 Oh, I don't know what the status of this is.
00:54:18 Are they going to do the Naruto running?
00:54:20 God, I hope so.
00:54:21 I can't wait.
00:54:22 I mean, there's been discussion for a long time
00:54:25 about a live action one piece TV adaptation
00:54:29 for the West, and that's coming.
00:54:31 There is, in fact, a Bleach live action show
00:54:35 running in Japan right now, I think.
00:54:38 Cray.
00:54:38 I mean, that would work better for Bleach,
00:54:40 I think, than one piece.
00:54:41 Yeah, Bleach kind of makes sense.
00:54:44 It didn't even look terrible from what I saw.
00:54:46 One piece will be a nightmare,
00:54:48 and I'm very excited just to see how depraved
00:54:52 it goes.
00:54:53 Yeah, to CG an arm.
00:54:58 Wait, hold on, hold on.
00:54:59 Is this confirmed?
00:55:00 Is a live action American?
00:55:03 Is it American?
00:55:04 Let me double check.
00:55:05 Let me check.
00:55:08 Who's looking forward to Netflix Cowboy Bebop?
00:55:11 Yeah, that's...
00:55:13 No.
00:55:17 There's a commercial for it, apparently.
00:55:19 Um, okay, well, if, I mean, if one piece is dub,
00:55:24 if the way they handle the dub is any indication,
00:55:27 then one piece, the remake,
00:55:29 will be a fucking shit show nightmare.
00:55:31 I mean, you don't need to look to the dub to...
00:55:34 One piece is not...
00:55:36 One piece couldn't even survive the transition
00:55:37 into anime smoothly, much less a fucking live action.
00:55:41 At times it did, but check it out,
00:55:43 there's a trailer we'll put in the show notes.
00:55:45 I guess it's actually Japanese, so okay.
00:55:48 And it looks like they did a...
00:55:50 Wow, yeah, Nami looks fucking weird.
00:55:53 That looks fucking weird.
00:55:54 I think Nami should have been white.
00:55:55 Look at the giant reindeer that is chopper.
00:55:57 He's like a big fucking reindeer.
00:55:59 I think I've changed my mind of Nami should be white.
00:56:03 This is wrong.
00:56:04 She looks weird.
00:56:06 One piece characters have nationalities,
00:56:08 as confirmed by Oda.
00:56:10 Nami, I think, is Swedish.
00:56:11 What's Nami's?
00:56:12 Nami's Swedish.
00:56:12 Okay, Swedish.
00:56:14 Okay, I like that they are very show accurate.
00:56:18 They are super show accurate.
00:56:19 These look, oh my gosh.
00:56:20 That's always how it is
00:56:21 at the Japanese live action adaptations.
00:56:23 They're always like,
00:56:24 they go out of their way to make sure
00:56:25 it looks exactly like it.
00:56:26 They look like cosplayers.
00:56:28 They don't look like characters.
00:56:29 The thing is though, they look kind of weirdly...
00:56:31 Like, one piece is a cartoon, right?
00:56:33 And these look like big meaty scars on Luffy's scar
00:56:37 and big slices out of Zoro's face,
00:56:40 or he has his scars, and it's weird.
00:56:42 And Nami's tits are unsettlingly large.
00:56:45 It's kind of strange.
00:56:45 Sanji is like eyebrow.
00:56:47 It looks like a stick was glued to his face.
00:56:50 It looks like they drew it on with eyeliner.
00:56:52 Yeah, which I'm sure they did.
00:56:53 Okay, let me walk back.
00:56:54 I actually think it would have been really cool
00:56:57 if maybe Zoro and Luffy were Asian,
00:56:59 and then Sanji, Nami, and were white.
00:57:05 I think having a mixed race cast
00:57:07 would be really cool and really fitting
00:57:08 in a one piece adaptation.
00:57:09 It would be very fitting.
00:57:10 They're from all over the world, so yeah.
00:57:11 Yeah.
00:57:12 But what can you do?
00:57:14 Oh well.
00:57:14 Okay, anyway, enough about all this business.
00:57:18 So have you guys watched Thunderbolt Fantasy?
00:57:22 No.
00:57:22 Is that the puppet show?
00:57:23 Yes.
00:57:25 I have no.
00:57:26 But it looks really...
00:57:27 Oh my fucking face, right?
00:57:28 It's Gennaribuchi, right?
00:57:30 Yeah.
00:57:31 Yeah.
00:57:32 It looks cool, but I haven't seen it.
00:57:33 It's good.
00:57:34 I like it.
00:57:36 What do you like about it?
00:57:38 It's like, at first I didn't think I would like it.
00:57:41 After the first episode, I was like,
00:57:42 but then the writing is surprisingly good.
00:57:47 It's kind of cheesy, but good cheesy,
00:57:50 and I could really appreciate the cheesiness.
00:57:53 It would have to be cheesy to get over the hubo.
00:57:55 How long is it?
00:57:55 Because I actually want to give it a shot.
00:57:58 I think there's two seasons on a movie.
00:58:01 Yeah.
00:58:01 There was a...
00:58:03 Season one was like 12 episodes back in 2016,
00:58:06 and now they've made a second one more recently.
00:58:10 The movie made me so sad.
00:58:13 Yeah.
00:58:14 Was it tragic?
00:58:15 It was kind of, yeah.
00:58:17 Yeah, it was.
00:58:18 Not even kinder.
00:58:19 It was.
00:58:21 Damn, let's go.
00:58:21 Have you seen it, Digi?
00:58:23 I watched, like, I think six or seven episodes of season one.
00:58:27 I ended up dropping it, but just because it's...
00:58:32 It's just written very, like, keep...
00:58:35 Like, everything's mysterious.
00:58:36 Like, you don't...
00:58:38 I hate that kind of writing in general,
00:58:40 where it's just like constantly...
00:58:42 Suggesting that there's more going on,
00:58:44 but not giving you enough information.
00:58:46 I mean, of course, I know it will eventually divulge everything,
00:58:49 but I just got sick of it.
00:58:51 But, like, I...
00:58:51 The visuals are really cool.
00:58:53 Like, it's basically a Tokusatsu show with puppets as the main characters.
00:58:57 I was just gonna say that, yeah,
00:58:59 it reminds me of Kamen Rider and shit.
00:59:00 Yeah.
00:59:02 How fucking...
00:59:02 I don't know, I think that's just neat as hell.
00:59:06 Incidentally...
00:59:07 Nifty is what it is.
00:59:08 You know what...
00:59:09 You know where everyone needs to start turning their attention soon
00:59:13 is to fucking Chinese anime.
00:59:15 Because over the last, like, four years,
00:59:19 China has been doing all these, like, Japanese co-productions
00:59:22 through this company, Howliners.
00:59:23 And, like, at first, most of them were, like...
00:59:28 Not...
00:59:28 They're all fairly high quality,
00:59:30 but, like, most of them just felt, like, anime,
00:59:33 but made by China, and it was really weird and jarring.
00:59:37 But over time, some of...
00:59:39 There's just been some really fucking great shows coming out of there.
00:59:42 And, like, when we're in a period where anime is looking worse and worse,
00:59:45 the Chinese anime looks great.
00:59:48 And, um...
00:59:49 Yeah.
00:59:49 There's this show called Modao Zushi that I'm three episodes into.
00:59:54 And it just is, like...
00:59:56 It's really mind-blowing.
00:59:57 It's a lot like Avatar the Last Airbender,
00:59:59 where you have that weird feeling of, like,
01:00:01 I can tell this isn't Japanese,
01:00:04 but it looks like anime,
01:00:05 and it's way better than most of the anime I've seen.
01:00:09 So, uh, I love it.
01:00:11 I'm hearing you rave about it yesterday in the livestream.
01:00:14 I was very curious to check it out.
01:00:17 Speaking of anime-looking bed...
01:00:19 Oh, did you want to say something else, did you?
01:00:22 No, just that it's mega...
01:00:23 It's mega interesting because it is really gorgeous,
01:00:26 and especially the background art,
01:00:27 which is, like, my biggest problem with most anime coming out.
01:00:30 And, like, it looks as though
01:00:32 they probably drew the backgrounds,
01:00:34 like, really fucking huge,
01:00:36 and then just scaled them down,
01:00:37 because, like, the amount of detail is just fucking absurd
01:00:40 in a lot of the backgrounds.
01:00:41 And, like...
01:00:41 Shit, that sounds dope.
01:00:42 So, you just have, like, these absolutely gorgeous vistas
01:00:46 of, like, rural China and shit.
01:00:47 And it's a, you know, it's a Wushu story style.
01:00:51 That's why Thunderbolt Fantasy made me think of it,
01:00:53 because it's the same type of story,
01:00:54 where it's, like, you know, that crouching tiger,
01:00:56 hidden dragon, like, wirefoo style of, uh, shit.
01:00:59 But it's all, like, couched in Chinese mysticism and stuff.
01:01:02 And, like, it's just really fucking weird,
01:01:05 because the sensibilities of it I'm not used to,
01:01:08 because, like, all of the wordplay
01:01:10 or just, like, the attitudes of the characters
01:01:12 are just something I've never experienced before,
01:01:14 because I don't know enough Chinese media, you know?
01:01:17 I was gonna say, after having consumed
01:01:18 so much Japanese media, it's been...
01:01:20 Will I ever be able to get over
01:01:22 what's been built into me, my attitude,
01:01:24 that the Chinese are just there for me to pillage and rape?
01:01:27 Uh, I don't know.
01:01:28 Fucking mainlanders.
01:01:29 Fucking mainlanders don't even believe in ghosts.
01:01:32 Get the fuck out of here.
01:01:33 I mean, and the great thing about it is that, like,
01:01:35 as weird as it is, the dialogue is really sly and interesting.
01:01:40 Like, the character dynamics are great.
01:01:42 Also, it is, and I didn't even know this until, like,
01:01:46 episode three and doing additional research,
01:01:49 is considered by many to be a BL story.
01:01:52 And it definitely, like, you can see the trappings of it,
01:01:56 and you're like, oh, I've seen some people argue
01:01:58 that it's not BL, so I'm guessing it doesn't go
01:02:01 super far with, like, you know, with them actually, like,
01:02:04 fucking or anything.
01:02:04 Could you, like, just tell me quickly the first episode?
01:02:07 I might know what you're talking about.
01:02:08 Uh, the first episode is about, like,
01:02:10 a bunch of fucking zombies and shit.
01:02:12 Chinese zombies.
01:02:12 Are we still talking about Thunderbolt Fantasy?
01:02:14 No.
01:02:14 No, we're talking about Moldau Zushi.
01:02:17 Oh, okay.
01:02:18 Moldau Zushi.
01:02:19 Bill...
01:02:20 I was like, it's a little...
01:02:21 Boy's love.
01:02:21 Boy's love.
01:02:22 Does the main guy die, but then, like, not die?
01:02:25 Well, the main character is, like, a, uh...
01:02:30 He had been dead, but he's, like, the creator of the dark arts.
01:02:34 Like, there's sorcery in this world,
01:02:35 and he created, like, a dark sorcery.
01:02:39 And the story begins with some kid who's been, like...
01:02:43 It's like a kid who's, like, with his, um,
01:02:46 like, living with his aunt or whatever,
01:02:47 and, like, the aunts a bitch, and her son's an asshole,
01:02:50 and they, like, are just constantly abusing
01:02:52 and beating the shit out of him.
01:02:54 So he's sacked, like, he does this, like,
01:02:55 blood ritual to summon the spirit
01:02:59 of the guy who created the dark arts,
01:03:00 like, into his body.
01:03:01 Just gives it to him.
01:03:02 Like, he's gone.
01:03:03 Okay.
01:03:04 This kid is dead.
01:03:05 He has sacrificed himself to give his body
01:03:08 to the creator of the dark arts
01:03:10 in exchange for him, like, murdering that whole family.
01:03:13 And, um...
01:03:14 It's not the one I saw.
01:03:15 Because there was a...
01:03:17 Another, like, I know there was a Chinese anime
01:03:19 that was sort of BL, but, like,
01:03:20 I couldn't get into it after the first episode.
01:03:22 So it was just so not well written
01:03:25 and then not likeable characters.
01:03:27 So I'm happy to hear it's not the one.
01:03:29 This BL is BS.
01:03:31 It reminds me of, like, the first...
01:03:33 The first...
01:03:34 I read the first book of, like, the, um,
01:03:36 the newer series by the Death Note guy.
01:03:41 Wait, I read this at your house, Digi.
01:03:43 Oh, Platinum End.
01:03:44 It's... Yeah, Platinum End is also about, like,
01:03:46 a kid who lives with, like, an aunt and uncle
01:03:48 who, like, abuse him, and he...
01:03:50 I don't think he murders...
01:03:51 He doesn't... He, like, gets the uncle
01:03:53 to murder the aunt or something.
01:03:55 Something like that happens.
01:03:55 And then the uncle goes to jail for life
01:03:57 or something like that.
01:03:58 Yeah.
01:03:59 Never mind.
01:04:00 Totally pointless diversion there.
01:04:01 I know he cares.
01:04:02 I read that as well and found it...
01:04:05 It was alright.
01:04:07 That's all I have to say.
01:04:07 Yes, I would have read Volume 2
01:04:09 if I'd had it available, but it didn't.
01:04:11 The guy's art, you know, is great.
01:04:13 Takashi, Obata, or whatever.
01:04:15 Still great.
01:04:16 It's still too good.
01:04:16 Alright.
01:04:17 Cool.
01:04:18 You know, whatever.
01:04:19 Sure.
01:04:20 Media, anime, animation.
01:04:22 Nice.
01:04:22 Good.
01:04:23 Whatever.
01:04:24 I'm making real things.
01:04:25 I'm making real animation in my own studio
01:04:29 on my own computer right now.
01:04:30 Well, tell me more.
01:04:32 And, alright.
01:04:33 Well, it's something that's...
01:04:33 Tell me more.
01:04:35 I'm telling you more.
01:04:36 Okay.
01:04:37 I've been animating the ending of Bailjiep,
01:04:41 which has been...
01:04:43 It has taken a while, but, like, I've been
01:04:46 making some strides with it.
01:04:47 It's ending?
01:04:48 And it's, yeah.
01:04:49 I've been working on the final animation.
01:04:51 I felt the conclusion coming.
01:04:53 I didn't realize it was so soon, but dope.
01:04:54 I'm excited.
01:04:55 Yeah.
01:04:56 I gotta catch up.
01:04:57 Now I'm gonna definitely read the whole thing, because...
01:05:00 Yeah.
01:05:00 I'm up to date.
01:05:01 These guys are slackers.
01:05:02 I'm up to date.
01:05:03 Help me.
01:05:03 I'm your real fan.
01:05:04 These guys are fake fans.
01:05:06 Yeah.
01:05:06 I don't believe in being up to date.
01:05:09 I mean, I'm, like, two years behind on One Piece.
01:05:12 Yeah.
01:05:13 Right.
01:05:13 So, like, I've got, like, doing the animation and all that.
01:05:17 Secretly.
01:05:18 Now, not secretly, because it's public.
01:05:20 Mm-hmm.
01:05:20 Or maybe I've mentioned it somewhere public already.
01:05:23 There's a possibility of...
01:05:25 Oh, no, I have mentioned it publicly.
01:05:27 Pump plushies.
01:05:29 Yeah, that's right.
01:05:29 That would be excellent.
01:05:31 I am very curious how you would do that.
01:05:34 Right.
01:05:34 Well, I've got...
01:05:35 There's this company that I used to get that Ryska plushie
01:05:38 that I made just for...
01:05:40 Because it was, you know, I just wanted it.
01:05:42 I just wanted it.
01:05:44 They do...
01:05:45 What do you call it?
01:05:46 Mass production now?
01:05:48 Yeah.
01:05:48 Yeah.
01:05:48 So, I have...
01:05:50 I've given them a design.
01:05:51 They've got back to me with the finished little thing.
01:05:53 And they're going to send me a sample,
01:05:55 which is going to get here in about a month or something.
01:05:58 And then once I say...
01:05:59 I have the sample.
01:06:00 Once I say a go, they're going to make a certain amount
01:06:04 and then send them to me.
01:06:06 And I'm thinking, if I can kickstart, you know,
01:06:11 the cost of shipping them out to people
01:06:14 and the cost of production for the things,
01:06:16 I can get a few hundred or maybe a hundred and fifty
01:06:20 of these plushies made and sent out.
01:06:22 So, in time for the ending of Bailjade to drop,
01:06:27 and it will be a whole big marketing ploy.
01:06:30 I am extremely interested in this,
01:06:32 and I'm going to be following the progress.
01:06:34 I want to see how these plushies look,
01:06:36 and I want to talk to you about your experience with this company
01:06:38 because I'm interested in doing something similar.
01:06:40 Well, here's what I'm curious about.
01:06:42 Does it have to be that huge of an amount?
01:06:45 Because I feel like you're not probably going to sell
01:06:48 over a hundred of them unless they're cheap.
01:06:51 I'm not.
01:06:51 But what I'm wondering is,
01:06:53 do you need to front the cost with the Kickstarter?
01:06:57 I don't know.
01:06:57 How much is it going to cost you relative
01:06:59 to how much you're going to sell it for?
01:07:00 Is it just so you can keep the cost low?
01:07:03 All I want is for them to exist.
01:07:05 I don't really need to make a big profit off of them.
01:07:07 And also, it's an American company,
01:07:09 so sending them to me is already going to be expensive.
01:07:12 Right, sure.
01:07:13 So I don't think people would be willing to pay.
01:07:18 The prices, the amounts I could do,
01:07:21 are 50, 100, and 150.
01:07:25 And the higher up the number goes,
01:07:27 obviously, the lower the cost is overall.
01:07:30 150 is like two grand cheaper than just 50.
01:07:37 Wait, it's cheaper to make more?
01:07:40 Yeah, because they don't...
01:07:43 You know how mass production works.
01:07:45 You mean cheaper.
01:07:45 Oh, you mean it's cheaper than...
01:07:46 Like per unit or something.
01:07:47 You're saving that much more.
01:07:48 It would have been if you had paid the same per unit.
01:07:50 Yeah, okay.
01:07:51 So like if, on the Kickstarter,
01:07:54 I would just have one tier and a certain amount of things,
01:07:57 and once they're all filled, that's it.
01:07:59 And I don't want the plushies to be too expensive.
01:08:03 I asked on my Twitter how expensive people were thinking
01:08:07 they would pay for.
01:08:08 And a lot of people said no.
01:08:10 So I'm hoping that with the ending of the comic,
01:08:13 and once I have the sample,
01:08:14 I can make a video showing you what it looks like,
01:08:17 people will be more willing.
01:08:19 And who knows?
01:08:20 I'll throw out a number here that's just what I would like.
01:08:23 Considering if I could get a punk plushie,
01:08:25 I would consider going up to 50 bucks, I think.
01:08:28 Beyond that, I think it starts to get rather ludicrous for me.
01:08:31 I don't know if I would pay 50 for it.
01:08:33 I mean, it depends on the size.
01:08:35 I'm imagining something that's maybe like
01:08:37 eight to 12 inches end to end.
01:08:43 I don't have the data with me,
01:08:45 but I did figure out certain sizes and costs.
01:08:48 I think it's going to be about this big.
01:08:52 I'm making a motion with my hands.
01:08:55 Great.
01:08:55 So get excited for that.
01:09:00 I asked them to make her limbs, arms, and legs floppy
01:09:03 so she can flop around.
01:09:04 I am.
01:09:06 Can you tell me that?
01:09:07 I mean, do you mind saying the name of the service?
01:09:09 Because I'm.
01:09:10 He can tell you later, I guess.
01:09:11 Well, I could if you don't.
01:09:12 Yeah, I want to know.
01:09:13 Oh, I don't mind.
01:09:15 Uh, it's, uh, oh, what is it?
01:09:18 Uh, fucking.
01:09:20 Budsies as in like buddies, but with a Z with a Z.
01:09:25 But with an S buds.
01:09:26 I'll just type it.
01:09:27 Okay.
01:09:28 Sounds like a fucking weed website.
01:09:31 What it is, what it actually is,
01:09:33 is like a website where they say,
01:09:36 send in your child's drawings and we'll make their plushies real
01:09:40 and send them back to you and it's all, you know, very young.
01:09:45 But, you know, I'm, you know, a grown man, but, you know,
01:09:48 I'm a man child and therefore I am the target demographic.
01:09:51 What if you had to pretend it was a child's drawing?
01:09:54 You've had to like be like, oh yeah, my son made this.
01:09:57 No, I didn't say anything, but I hope that they think
01:10:00 that it's someone's son because I didn't draw it very well.
01:10:03 I drew it very exactly, but like it's still like punk,
01:10:06 which is a stick figure.
01:10:07 Yeah.
01:10:08 I drew it from the front and the side and they know what,
01:10:11 what it looks like.
01:10:12 It's adorable.
01:10:13 The, I could, yeah, this, this seems like a service that more
01:10:16 than just fucking people with shitty kids that can't draw
01:10:20 would want to make you so.
01:10:21 Also, the reason I trusted it in the first place to make the
01:10:23 brisker plush is because, um, I think some of them are furries
01:10:27 and they do like furry special things.
01:10:29 Nice.
01:10:29 Like if you have a furry OC.
01:10:30 Never doubt the furries.
01:10:31 If they, if they, they, if you have like a furry OC, you pay
01:10:35 like more to get like a very, um, you know, bespoke plush made
01:10:39 of your, your furry.
01:10:40 You know, they, they, they lead with the kids stuff to
01:10:43 hide the fact that 90% of their revenue is from furry OCs being created.
01:10:47 Yep.
01:10:47 Yep.
01:10:49 So like they, they, they do quality work.
01:10:52 I always see one.
01:10:53 Yeah.
01:10:53 For advanced specialty advanced commissions, for advanced drawings
01:10:56 and OCs, specialty plush and faux furs, sneak peek and two
01:11:00 rounds of changes.
01:11:01 And I'm seeing this in the sample image.
01:11:03 It sort of looks like the butter dragon from, uh, Undertale.
01:11:06 Yep.
01:11:07 But it's like green and it's covered in like stripes and it's got
01:11:09 like a blue afro and shit.
01:11:10 And these, these plushies, you know, they're quality because
01:11:12 they need to be able to take extreme amounts of damage.
01:11:14 Wear and tear from day to day use.
01:11:17 If you know what I mean.
01:11:17 Yeah.
01:11:18 Tell you.
01:11:19 I am.
01:11:19 Yeah.
01:11:20 Some of these sample images don't look like they were drawn by kids.
01:11:23 Yeah.
01:11:23 I am, I am tempted to make myself a mage plushie just because I want one.
01:11:28 You should.
01:11:28 Well, buying a single one is quite expensive.
01:11:31 The risker was like 200 pounds or something.
01:11:34 Yeah.
01:11:34 All cold.
01:11:35 Yeah, never mind.
01:11:35 But it is the only, it is the only risker plush that exists.
01:11:40 And it's the coolest thing that I own probably.
01:11:41 How could that be considering the popularity of Homestack?
01:11:43 That's just shocking.
01:11:44 I mean, maybe people have made like homemade ones.
01:11:46 Yeah, this is the highest quality one.
01:11:48 Yeah.
01:11:48 It's the coolest.
01:11:49 But yeah, obviously mass production costs go dramatically lower.
01:11:53 Let's do it.
01:11:56 Let's say, wait a minute.
01:11:57 Best of luck.
01:11:57 Wait just a fucking second.
01:11:59 Yeah.
01:11:59 Okay.
01:12:00 I'm seeing there's a sample, a sample image for something called selfies,
01:12:04 which is a, a being of yourself.
01:12:06 Oh yeah, that was so strange.
01:12:07 It looks very strange, but the sample image.
01:12:10 That's what I want.
01:12:10 I can't tell, but it almost looks like it's two people cosplaying.
01:12:13 The same, it's two people cosplaying at an anime convention.
01:12:16 The guy's got a katana and the girl's in like a corset.
01:12:19 I want a fucking high res image.
01:12:21 I want to know what they're doing, but I can't, it's too small.
01:12:23 I can't make it out.
01:12:24 He's definitely got a katana though.
01:12:25 His plus, he's got a floppy katana.
01:12:27 It's like, it's like he's holding the handle at a 90 degree angle,
01:12:30 but it's flopping down and pointing straight at the floor.
01:12:32 He had a floppy katana.
01:12:33 Fucking good.
01:12:35 Looks like shit.
01:12:36 But, you know.
01:12:36 Well, good work guys.
01:12:38 Yeah.
01:12:39 The other one's pretty good though.
01:12:40 Well, hey, with that, maybe we should do the voicemails.
01:12:43 No.
01:12:43 No?
01:12:44 No.
01:12:44 APS, APSadventures.site is where you can read my comic.
01:12:47 We can't, we can't go to the voicemails because I have a bit to do.
01:12:52 It's time.
01:12:53 Oh.
01:12:53 It's time everyone.
01:12:55 For the new, the new thing.
01:12:57 The new thing that we do on the, on the PCP.
01:13:00 Fucking.
01:13:02 It's time.
01:13:09 There it is.
01:13:09 Everything's so far away.
01:13:16 Everyone's favorite shell.
01:13:18 Thank you whoever made that.
01:13:20 Anyone remember whose voicemail that was?
01:13:22 I don't.
01:13:23 All right.
01:13:24 Okay.
01:13:25 Let me, let me, this week's round of grievances with the pizza party podcast.
01:13:30 Yeah.
01:13:31 I'm very pissed.
01:13:32 Oh, is that what this is?
01:13:32 I still, I still haven't heard the podcast.
01:13:37 Where's the, where's the podcast?
01:13:40 I'm, I'm looking around.
01:13:44 I'm looking all around 360.
01:13:47 I don't see it.
01:13:48 Where's the podcast?
01:13:50 Can't find it.
01:13:51 That's bad conveyance.
01:13:51 That's a zero out of ten experience right there.
01:13:54 I know where the PCP is.
01:13:58 It's right here.
01:13:59 It's where this voice that you're hearing right now, wherever it's emanating from.
01:14:02 PCP right here, right now.
01:14:05 In your face, visceral.
01:14:07 PPP, nowhere.
01:14:09 Nothing.
01:14:09 A mere shade.
01:14:10 In the toilet.
01:14:11 A phantom.
01:14:12 In the toilet.
01:14:13 Not even real.
01:14:15 Second, what kind of pizza?
01:14:17 Are we talking about a high quality wood-fired brick oven artisan pizza?
01:14:20 It's almost certainly not.
01:14:21 We're talking about some Papa John Little Caesars bullshit.
01:14:24 I have no confidence in this brand.
01:14:26 I have no idea what the nutritional value is.
01:14:29 I have no idea what my value for money is going to be.
01:14:31 I go into this, I go into this investment, this investment of time and money
01:14:35 with no idea of what I'm going to receive and frankly I'm not comfortable with it
01:14:39 in the, down the drain, in the toilet, pizza party podcast, get it together,
01:14:44 or else you'll be featured on another segment next week.
01:14:47 Oh, it's time to shit on the pizza party podcast.
01:14:51 You're here.
01:14:51 Bad campaign.
01:14:52 Hooray.
01:14:53 Ben, I have to question your ability to analytically read between the lines.
01:14:59 I mean, why would there ever be a brick oven-fired pizza at a pizza party?
01:15:03 You always go for the cheapest, most, you know, definitely go for Little Caesars
01:15:08 if you're throwing a party because you're trying to feed as many people as possible.
01:15:12 Maybe it's, maybe it's party is more of an intimate gathering.
01:15:15 Maybe it's a political party.
01:15:17 Maybe it's like, oh shit.
01:15:19 It's like an old Italian gentleman gathering outside their bistro and someone brings out
01:15:24 a piping hot pizza pie from the ovens and it's just a lovely, decadent, old world experience.
01:15:31 Maybe that's the kind of party it is.
01:15:33 All right, I've had it with pizza pie.
01:15:35 I've had it with pizza pie.
01:15:36 Why is it called a pie?
01:15:37 A pie is tall.
01:15:38 A pie is have a crust over it.
01:15:40 Yeah, a pie, if anything, it's more of a tart because it has an open top.
01:15:45 That's what I said to your mother last night.
01:15:48 It's just more of a tart.
01:15:52 Nate says to his brother, Ben St.
01:15:56 So viewers, so viewers, if you, if you, if you've managed the Titanic task to find and
01:16:02 identify the pizza, where the pizza party podcast is or what it is, let them know to
01:16:07 get their act together or else Ben St. on the procrastinator podcast is gonna rip them a new one.
01:16:12 Hit them with some hard hashtag, where's the podcast?
01:16:16 Forever.
01:16:17 Yeah.
01:16:17 Yeah.
01:16:17 Hashtag.
01:16:18 Where's the podcast?
01:16:19 This is gonna overshadow this.
01:16:20 This where's a podcast?
01:16:21 Hashtag is gonna overshadow my where to beef.
01:16:25 Hashtag that I established yesterday.
01:16:27 What's that relevant to?
01:16:28 Where's the beef?
01:16:29 Because because there's this this Netflix film.
01:16:33 There's another like Chinese anime, except that it's entirely Japanese, except that it's Chinese.
01:16:39 But it's it's basically a Makoto Shinkai movie, except in China.
01:16:44 And the whole first part of this film, it's like 15 minutes of this guy talking about this dish
01:16:49 that he refers to almost exclusively as beefu.
01:16:53 He's always saying like, oh, that's the San Zhan beefu.
01:16:56 And he keeps talking about like, oh, we would eat that beefu.
01:16:59 And it was such good beefu.
01:17:00 However, however, zero times does the word beef appear in the subtitles.
01:17:07 So you're calling up the suburbs more than anybody else.
01:17:11 It's the soy boy conspiracy.
01:17:13 It was Netflix's subs.
01:17:14 So they removed the beefu.
01:17:16 Yeah, there's no beefu.
01:17:17 They censored it.
01:17:18 And he says beefu like literally 60 times.
01:17:21 Now vegetarian activists.
01:17:22 What did they say in the subtitles though?
01:17:26 They were just I mean, because first of all, the dish they would call San Zhan noodles,
01:17:30 which is like, I think that is another like name for the dish.
01:17:35 But the thing is that when he's just talking about like eating it,
01:17:38 he might say like, I would eat a big spoonful.
01:17:41 But like, and that's how they would translate it.
01:17:42 But like the way he actually says it in Japanese is like,
01:17:45 I would eat a spoonful of that beef.
01:17:47 You know, like he just kept insistently saying the word.
01:17:50 Now someone told me it's possible because there is a Japanese word for noodles
01:17:55 that is of some type that is beefu.
01:17:58 But but but it didn't seem to be the case.
01:18:02 I heard beefu over and over again, like literally 60 times in 15 minutes,
01:18:07 not once in the subtitles.
01:18:08 So so May and I made a whole we made a whole stink
01:18:12 about the where to beefu conspiracy, the soy boy conspiracy.
01:18:16 Excellent. Speaking of beefu, I went to, you know, during the meetup.
01:18:21 You got a bit of a beefu with the PC, the pizza party podcast.
01:18:25 Exactly. I certainly do.
01:18:26 I think we found the beefu.
01:18:32 But I went to remember for the meetup.
01:18:34 We all went to the the dumpling cafe in Chinatown.
01:18:38 After after Community Day, after Mama Swine or Swine Up Community Day,
01:18:42 I mean, me and Kazi went to beef that that place.
01:18:45 And I I have gotten some shit orders there.
01:18:48 They will let you order everything.
01:18:49 They will let you order like any fucking weird, like like garbage meat
01:18:53 and like bizarre roughage that you don't know what it is thrown on a plate.
01:18:56 Like when we were all there, I got some like clams on some like chopped,
01:19:01 like I don't even know what the vegetable was.
01:19:03 It was trash. I hated it.
01:19:05 This time I stuck to something that I got beef and black pepper.
01:19:08 I got beef with black pepper and it was so good.
01:19:10 It was delightful. It was a true delight.
01:19:12 It was spicy.
01:19:13 Does anyone know when I was there did I think what I got and it was gross and terrible.
01:19:18 I might be confusing with another Chinese place or whatever.
01:19:20 But like I got it was like general so is like totally basic.
01:19:24 When I bit into it, like the inside was like not cooked all the way.
01:19:27 And it was pink and disgusting.
01:19:29 And I hated it.
01:19:30 I have I have gotten some I have gotten some real bad shit.
01:19:34 Like one time I got like are we talking about that place that we all that we went?
01:19:38 Yeah, with you know, I don't understand why you keep going there.
01:19:42 If you've had bad experiences and it's literally surrounded on all sides by other Asian restaurants
01:19:50 that you can go to instead. I have had bad experiences.
01:19:53 I have had bad experiences, but I have also had very good experiences that have been very cheap
01:19:57 for the money. All right.
01:19:58 And that place was not cheap at all. That place.
01:20:01 Yeah, it was. Well, I you can get like you can get like a good like like lunch there for like
01:20:05 12. Have you been to enough Chinese places?
01:20:08 Like it's not it's not cheap for what it is.
01:20:13 No, but it's the devil.
01:20:17 That's the problem. I see people do this where you you select a restaurant and then you go there.
01:20:24 And if it's not shit, then you just keep going back, even though there's a chance
01:20:29 even if it's right across the street is better in every way.
01:20:33 And you just don't know because you don't even try one dish.
01:20:36 That's true beyond out of this world.
01:20:39 It was literally the first time I went there.
01:20:41 I paid 12 bucks and I got like the like pork belly and cabbage and it was really good for the price.
01:20:46 And I was like this place rules and I've never been able to let go of that association,
01:20:50 even though I've had I've gotten some real trash.
01:20:53 My methodology is when I move into a new place, I just try every single restaurant that is there.
01:20:59 And then from there, now I know what are the top ones.
01:21:02 And then I, you know, return to those continually from then on.
01:21:07 Yes, it's sort of like me because we have we have a lot.
01:21:11 We used to have a lot of takeaways and I would like to try out new restaurants and stuff.
01:21:17 But we tried out a lot of restaurants until we settled on one that we really like.
01:21:21 And we have a few backups in case that one's not available.
01:21:23 That's the key.
01:21:24 And I mean, the one that just it's funny to me because the one that Ben is talking about
01:21:28 is in Chinatown and it's just like it just seems like any random Chinese restaurant
01:21:35 in literally a sea of a lot of what you look way better like Asian restaurants that are just
01:21:43 all around like every door on the road for like a mile is just Asian restaurants.
01:21:49 It's like that feeling when you're with your boys and you I don't know, you're like out doing
01:21:52 something and like you're on your way to the restaurant that you're going to as you walk
01:21:56 by millions and millions of restaurants.
01:21:58 But we got to get to that one.
01:21:59 And you're just like, but what is why?
01:22:02 Because I'm looking over there and that looks like a really hoppin delicious Thai restaurant.
01:22:07 And this looks like a hole in the wall Chinese thing.
01:22:11 So why are we going to this one?
01:22:13 I don't know.
01:22:13 Guys like me, when you've got a plan, I don't want to deviate from the plan.
01:22:18 And I'll die before I do anything.
01:22:19 That's not the plan gives me that feeling of comfort that I you're not wrong.
01:22:24 Dude, there probably are.
01:22:26 There probably I mean, there's yeah, there probably are better places.
01:22:30 But there's like you say, there's so many and I'm not I can't check them all.
01:22:34 Why not?
01:22:34 Check them all.
01:22:35 I mean, I mean, I'm not in town enough to do that.
01:22:38 I guess if I'm in town, I will always go to a different place.
01:22:43 Like you just as a matter of course.
01:22:45 Now now maybe I want next time I'm in town.
01:22:47 Maybe I want to be like, let me just see what else is around.
01:22:50 I mean, to me, that's the point of living in a city is that there is so much variety
01:22:55 that you don't have to go to the same shit that you've already been to all the time.
01:22:58 You know, you go somewhere different every time because there's so much excitement,
01:23:02 so much to explore and discover.
01:23:04 So why would you ever go to the same place if there's another place you haven't been to yet?
01:23:09 Once you've been everywhere, that's when you go, OK, well, I know the wheat from the chaff and
01:23:14 I'm just going to go to the good place.
01:23:15 I've thrashed my milk and separated the chaff out.
01:23:19 Remember that?
01:23:19 That was a classic moment on the last episode of the PCP.
01:23:23 I wasn't there.
01:23:23 Of course, of course.
01:23:25 OK, all right, never mind.
01:23:27 How about we get to those voicemails?
01:23:28 I think it's time.
01:23:29 I think it's time that we go do that.
01:23:30 All right.
01:23:32 OK, let's see.
01:23:33 Everybody speak pipe.
01:23:34 You know the deal.
01:23:35 Give us your stuff.
01:23:37 Click the link below.
01:23:38 Send it to the speak pipe link.
01:23:40 You know what I'm talking about.
01:23:41 All right, let's get into it.
01:23:42 First mail here.
01:23:44 Let me get to the right place here.
01:23:46 There we go.
01:23:46 OK, this is from Rune Factory is Good.
01:23:49 Yes.
01:23:50 OK, go.
01:23:53 What's up, PCP?
01:23:54 I'm calling in because I can't take any more of Nate's wrong opinions.
01:23:59 Now this started with his wrong opinions about the economy.
01:24:02 It continued with his wrong opinions about food.
01:24:06 But now I'm literally boiling with rage over his recent
01:24:12 horrible affront to me.
01:24:14 That Rune Factory 4 is a bad game that people shouldn't buy.
01:24:18 He said this in the Nintendo Direct live stream.
01:24:20 Yeah, that's where he's messing up.
01:24:21 And frankly, I am fucking pissed.
01:24:26 What problem did you possibly have with the game
01:24:29 that takes farming the hard works of a person to improve themselves
01:24:34 and gain social capital points and literal capital in the world
01:24:38 by selling the fucking robbery.
01:24:41 He's going to say like, oh my god, farming.
01:24:42 Nate, it's like, sweat of your brown shit.
01:24:44 Yeah, OK, I got it.
01:24:45 This is literally self-saving.
01:24:47 The combat is dog shit.
01:24:49 And Rune Factory 4, I hated it.
01:24:51 I labored through that game for a year.
01:24:54 It was fine.
01:24:55 I got my waifu.
01:24:57 I played a bunch of Rune Factory 4 and I made it.
01:25:00 The point of the game is that it is.
01:25:02 I would almost compare it to like a clicker game
01:25:05 because it's mostly just about making numbers go up in.
01:25:09 Are you guys talking about Stardew Valley?
01:25:11 No, no, no.
01:25:11 It's very similar.
01:25:12 A game about farming with dog shit combat.
01:25:15 It's just about making numbers.
01:25:16 We may as well be talking about Stardew Valley.
01:25:18 They're both harvest Rune Clones.
01:25:20 But the whole point of Rune Factory is that it's harvest Rune.
01:25:24 Right, it's harvest Rune, but in a fantasy world
01:25:26 and with swords and dungeons and stuff.
01:25:29 Is harvest Rune in the real world?
01:25:30 That's Stardew Valley.
01:25:32 That's Stardew Valley is that exact description.
01:25:34 But Rune Factory is a lot more combat driven.
01:25:36 It's more anime-esque.
01:25:38 And way more anime-esque.
01:25:39 But is it 3D?
01:25:40 But yeah, it is like pretty much.
01:25:42 There's just like an endless amount of things you can do
01:25:46 and only so much time in the day.
01:25:48 So it's all about like managing what do I want to do
01:25:50 with my time and constantly being on the grind.
01:25:54 And like it's one of those things where the satisfaction
01:25:57 is just in that literally no matter what you do
01:26:00 as long as you're doing something
01:26:01 you are making some kind of progress.
01:26:03 So it's just that feeling of just constantly doing
01:26:09 little things that are like, oh I'm getting better
01:26:11 and my numbers are going up.
01:26:12 Everything is better than it was a second ago.
01:26:14 But like the actual what you do never gets more complicated
01:26:18 as a player.
01:26:19 With games like this.
01:26:19 This isn't 3D.
01:26:21 Well it's top down.
01:26:22 The models are 3D.
01:26:24 This is what I meant.
01:26:25 But when I ask 3D I really just want to know if I can move up.
01:26:28 Can you turn the camera?
01:26:29 No, yeah, no you can't.
01:26:30 You can't.
01:26:31 Because that's what makes me enjoy things.
01:26:32 With a game like Rune Factory or like I'm comparing it
01:26:35 to the other games.
01:26:36 It's what matters in this.
01:26:38 Because there's so many competitors.
01:26:39 It's like are the small gameplay tweaks tuned
01:26:43 in the best way compared to the competition.
01:26:45 And I definitely think that Stardew Valley
01:26:48 is just like way more fun.
01:26:50 There's more like customizability.
01:26:52 When was Rune Factory 4 actually released the first time?
01:26:57 God I don't know maybe like 2010 or something.
01:26:59 Yeah it's pretty old.
01:27:02 And I'll admit that the combat, a lot of it is clunky.
01:27:06 But I really personally really like it.
01:27:08 And I'm happy that it's coming to Switch.
01:27:10 I don't have a switch yet.
01:27:11 I want to talk about Stardew Valley.
01:27:13 I want to talk, guys, I'm fucking torn.
01:27:16 I'm fucking torn between Emily, Leah, and Abigail.
01:27:19 I just, how am I supposed to choose?
01:27:21 Abigail, she's purple.
01:27:22 I like the purple barmaid hair I think.
01:27:24 No, she's blue hair.
01:27:25 She's blue hair.
01:27:26 Yeah that was my first choice.
01:27:27 But then I started to warm up to Leah
01:27:29 and then later Abigail now.
01:27:31 Like at first I was like cut and dry Emily.
01:27:33 But then, but it's just gotten more complicated.
01:27:35 Abigail, she's purple and she eats rocks.
01:27:37 The romance triangle is just spiraling out of control.
01:27:40 There's so many feelings.
01:27:41 Oh, yeah, Abigail eats anything.
01:27:43 Anything you get, it doesn't matter if you give her an answer.
01:27:45 Well what a slut, am I right?
01:27:46 How'd you know?
01:27:47 How'd you know?
01:27:47 I was hungry.
01:27:48 This looks delicious.
01:27:49 I recommend instead of Rune Factory playing Reciteer.
01:27:54 I like, I love Reciteer.
01:27:56 It's good.
01:27:57 I played Reciteer.
01:27:58 I got to the end game.
01:27:59 It's not the same though.
01:28:01 The end game, the end game seemed like a nightmare grind slog
01:28:05 and I didn't want anything to do with it.
01:28:06 So I just played through the main campaign
01:28:08 and was happy with it.
01:28:09 I think Stardew Valley is just the peak of this kind of game.
01:28:11 Though, I mean Reciteer is basically a different one.
01:28:13 Personally, I think it's not quite the same
01:28:15 but it's pretty simple.
01:28:16 I really dislike the aesthetic of Stardew Valley
01:28:18 and also I think it's mega fucking boring.
01:28:19 I don't care for it much.
01:28:21 I don't, I don't understand that at all.
01:28:23 I think it looks great.
01:28:24 Yo, but the main, the quest loop.
01:28:25 What the fuck?
01:28:27 What the fuck?
01:28:27 I just found out so much.
01:28:29 And the girls aren't anime enough.
01:28:30 The girls are way too western.
01:28:33 They used to be more anime.
01:28:34 I wish we could go back.
01:28:36 There's old art of previous versions of the game.
01:28:38 They were way more anime at certain points.
01:28:40 I don't, wait, what don't you like about the aesthetic?
01:28:41 This is totally bad.
01:28:42 I really don't, first of all,
01:28:43 I don't like how everything is weirdly tall.
01:28:46 And secondly, I don't like the color design that much.
01:28:49 For me, it's all about the character art.
01:28:50 I don't, I think the people look ugly.
01:28:53 You can download mods to change their portraits.
01:28:55 What, on my Switch version?
01:28:57 Can I do that?
01:28:57 Which is where I have the game.
01:28:59 I mean.
01:28:59 That's what I thought.
01:29:01 Well, that's your mistake.
01:29:03 I don't think that, I don't,
01:29:04 I wouldn't praise the game and say,
01:29:05 wow, it has such great character art or anything.
01:29:07 I mean, I don't really care.
01:29:09 I don't get it.
01:29:09 When I'm trying to get that nut,
01:29:11 Stardew Valley is not the game that I need.
01:29:14 I mean, I don't care about the,
01:29:16 I don't care about the portrait art.
01:29:18 I don't care about that nut.
01:29:18 It's better.
01:29:19 Shut up.
01:29:20 I don't care about the portrait art.
01:29:21 I care about, like, look at, like,
01:29:23 everything is such like nice, lush, like, sprite work.
01:29:26 It's, it's gorgeous.
01:29:26 The town is, the town is very attractive, I think.
01:29:29 Mostly.
01:29:30 So yeah, I like all that stuff.
01:29:32 And, and, and the best thing about Stardew Valley,
01:29:34 the most satisfying thing about the game
01:29:36 is the long-term quest of fixing up the community center
01:29:40 by achieving all those little individual goals
01:29:42 is super satisfying.
01:29:43 The game fucking blue-balled me
01:29:44 for like almost an entire year now.
01:29:47 I have been short on fixing the communities
01:29:49 to all I need.
01:29:50 Yeah.
01:29:50 An apple and a pomegranate.
01:29:52 Waiting for the, the season-specific products
01:29:54 can't completely hamstring me.
01:29:55 And it's just because I didn't buy it
01:29:57 from the mystery merchant.
01:29:58 Yeah, I think so.
01:29:59 That's true.
01:29:59 I have been going to the traveling cart
01:30:01 every, like, every Friday and Sunday
01:30:04 and looking, hoping for,
01:30:05 I remember one time I did see a pomegranate there
01:30:07 but it was before I realized that, like,
01:30:09 I needed that for the community center.
01:30:11 So I fucked up.
01:30:12 So I have been waiting, yeah, like,
01:30:14 I planted, I planted a pomegranate tree
01:30:16 and an apple tree but it was like right after,
01:30:18 it was just too late that I could,
01:30:20 it wasn't after the season,
01:30:20 I planted it just into the season.
01:30:22 So it did, the tree didn't mature
01:30:24 until the season was already over.
01:30:25 So I've just been waiting for the year to go by.
01:30:27 To get one apple and one pomegranate.
01:30:30 So, like, it's directly to the actual human year.
01:30:35 No, but it is, it is, like, slower.
01:30:38 Like, a season will last, like, 30 days.
01:30:40 Each season is 28 days, yeah.
01:30:42 So each season is more like a month, basically.
01:30:45 And you could just make your guy, like,
01:30:46 go to sleep, wake up, go to sleep,
01:30:47 wake up, go to sleep.
01:30:48 But you have to do that, like, 90 times
01:30:49 to get back to the season.
01:30:51 And you'll, like, ruin your-
01:30:52 I'm waking up and realizing we're still
01:30:55 reacting to the first voicemail.
01:30:56 That's true.
01:30:57 We should move it along.
01:30:58 Let's move it along here.
01:30:59 Okay, next one is from-
01:31:00 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:31:01 Post in the comments.
01:31:02 Should I go with Emily, Leah, or Abigail?
01:31:04 These are your choices.
01:31:06 Actually, go for Sebastian.
01:31:07 He's your boy.
01:31:09 I like Sebastian.
01:31:10 Are you allowed to be gay?
01:31:11 Yeah.
01:31:12 If I were going for a guy,
01:31:15 I would absolutely go for Sebastian.
01:31:16 I knew you would.
01:31:17 I knew you would.
01:31:18 He's the edgy one.
01:31:19 Okay, next one.
01:31:20 Voice mail from Mackie's back.
01:31:23 Go.
01:31:24 Hey, so, PCP, recently, a good friend of mine
01:31:29 admitted they had a crush on me,
01:31:31 making me the first PCP fan with a girlfriend.
01:31:33 Wow.
01:31:35 But here's the issue.
01:31:37 She lives in Florida.
01:31:38 I live in Massachusetts.
01:31:40 And neither of us have that much money.
01:31:44 So, I know some of you have had weird internet
01:31:48 relationships like this.
01:31:49 Do you have any advice?
01:31:51 Help?
01:31:53 Don't do it.
01:31:56 Give up.
01:31:57 Give up.
01:31:57 It's difficult.
01:31:58 I mean, I would say you can cheaply
01:32:02 take a train down there, right?
01:32:04 Like, that's how Ben was visited, too.
01:32:06 From Massachusetts, I mean, relatively cheaply.
01:32:07 I used to, yeah, well, okay.
01:32:10 When I used to go from Virginia to Georgia,
01:32:13 it would take me like,
01:32:14 it would only cost me maybe like 20 or 30 bucks
01:32:16 for the whole trip.
01:32:17 But it would take me like 16 hours.
01:32:20 I mean, it's just a matter of how determined are you.
01:32:23 Like, do you really like this girl or not?
01:32:26 Like, yeah.
01:32:26 Because I mean.
01:32:27 Let's be real.
01:32:28 Let's be real.
01:32:28 This is like the first guy,
01:32:30 the first girl who came to him said like,
01:32:31 I like you.
01:32:32 And so, of course, our boy is going to jump on it.
01:32:35 But, you know, like, if you came up to him today,
01:32:38 you lived in his town and said like,
01:32:40 hey, I want to date you.
01:32:41 Is he not going to drop this long distance girl
01:32:43 like a sack of potatoes?
01:32:44 No, of course.
01:32:45 But here's the question.
01:32:46 First of all, do you have any prospects
01:32:50 IRL and if have you lost your virginity?
01:32:55 If you have not lost your virginity
01:32:58 and she is like DTF, take a fucking train,
01:33:01 do it as cheaply as possible.
01:33:03 Do not take a flight, take a train,
01:33:05 take something cheap, keep it under 100 bucks,
01:33:09 get down there, meet her, have sex and see how things go.
01:33:15 And if it seems like you would like to eventually pursue this
01:33:19 as a serious thing, then you need to be working on
01:33:22 how can we get into the same place as soon as possible.
01:33:25 If there is no recourse there, if the answer is
01:33:29 we can't do that, shut this thing down.
01:33:32 Because like, you don't want to be in an internet relationship
01:33:35 for fucking who knows how long with no actual plan.
01:33:39 And you should, if you got, if you got,
01:33:41 okay, she's your girlfriend now.
01:33:43 If I assume you guys want to fuck.
01:33:45 So you and her should make that happen.
01:33:48 You should like, you know, get money and buy a train and buses.
01:33:53 And you can do it for not that much.
01:33:55 You can, if you look around,
01:33:56 you can probably find ways to do it.
01:33:57 I'll bet you could get from Massachusetts to Florida
01:33:59 for under, definitely under 100 bucks.
01:34:02 Maybe under 50 if you were really resourceful.
01:34:06 It will probably take you like a day or more.
01:34:07 But whatever, yeah.
01:34:09 If you want to, I don't know, I mean, I don't think,
01:34:12 I don't think it matters if you've lost your virginity or not.
01:34:14 If you want to fuck and you want to spend a day
01:34:17 or ends a little bit of money to make that happen, then do that.
01:34:21 Maybe get her to contribute because she's, you know,
01:34:24 part of this endeavor as well.
01:34:25 I just think that the most important thing more so than even going down there
01:34:29 is that like, if you do this, you have to know that like,
01:34:34 there's two ways that it can happen.
01:34:35 Either you'll go down and you'll, you'll,
01:34:37 you'll realize that you don't want this to be a long-term relationship
01:34:41 or you guys will super like each other and super click.
01:34:44 And then immediately the question is going to have to be,
01:34:47 how can we make this no longer long-distance?
01:34:50 Because long-distance relationships are suffering.
01:34:53 You will not be able to easily have sex again.
01:34:58 You won't be able to easily spend time together.
01:35:00 You won't be able to have that, you know, that,
01:35:03 that emotional support.
01:35:04 That is what you're really coming to a relationship for more so.
01:35:07 The end goal, the end goal of a long-distance relationship
01:35:11 needs to be to not be a long-distance relationship.
01:35:14 Otherwise it is a, it is a waste and you will be sorry.
01:35:18 It is a waste. It definitely is a waste.
01:35:21 And yeah, just don't, and don't put yourself in the position.
01:35:24 Well, hey, don't put yourself in the position where
01:35:26 you've got this long-distance girlfriend and you're like,
01:35:28 well, I've got no other prospects because it will make you weak
01:35:31 and it will make you just waste your time being like,
01:35:33 well, I've got a girlfriend so I'm all good, but no.
01:35:36 Yeah. No.
01:35:36 The other side of the coin though is that if you meet up, say,
01:35:40 and you get to know, you know, this relationship progresses
01:35:43 and you find yourself feeling like I'm not that interested
01:35:46 in progressing this and making this a not long-distance relationship,
01:35:50 then you know, quit. Don't do it.
01:35:52 Yeah. Give up.
01:35:53 And that's fine.
01:35:54 It's way easier to make those kind of decisions
01:35:56 when you've met the person in person.
01:35:57 Just it's a lot easier to sort out.
01:35:59 I think there's a problem or something.
01:36:01 You never really know the person until you have to live with them.
01:36:05 Yeah.
01:36:05 That's also true, but I think you can get a,
01:36:08 you'll know a lot more than you do just by talking online if you meet them.
01:36:13 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:36:15 And I don't know.
01:36:15 I don't know how much talk.
01:36:17 I don't know if you guys are like,
01:36:18 Skyping all the time and stuff like, you know,
01:36:20 does that just suck though?
01:36:22 I hate doing that.
01:36:23 It really sucks.
01:36:24 And like, I, so I don't know what I don't know,
01:36:27 like what level it's on where like, I don't know,
01:36:30 you know, how much you guys know about each other or how close you are.
01:36:33 But like, you definitely have to meet somebody in person
01:36:35 to get a better sense of what they're like than what you're going to get.
01:36:39 I mean, you know, you're only talking to each other
01:36:41 in like a manufactured scenario of like having to sit in front of a camera
01:36:46 and talk to a person directly,
01:36:48 as opposed to just like being around each other
01:36:51 and knowing what their mannerisms are like
01:36:53 and how they generally like the cadence of their living, you know,
01:36:57 which is much more important.
01:37:00 So feel it out dog.
01:37:02 So best of luck.
01:37:03 Don't don't settle for a shitty relationship
01:37:05 as opposed to no relationship.
01:37:07 Because sometimes none is better
01:37:08 because then you can just find one that is better.
01:37:10 So there you go.
01:37:11 It probably sounds like this probably just be a big waste of time.
01:37:15 Sorry, sorry to burst your bubble.
01:37:17 You know what, maybe this guy is like 15,
01:37:19 this is like the first person who's ever,
01:37:20 and like, great, fantastic.
01:37:21 Have a good time, you know, feel it out.
01:37:23 Sure.
01:37:25 Do what you gotta do.
01:37:25 But don't trap yourself somewhere.
01:37:27 And then they're going to be like,
01:37:29 Oh, but don't you love me?
01:37:30 If you love me, you date me no matter where I was from.
01:37:31 I don't love you, bitch.
01:37:32 I don't love you.
01:37:33 Just say that to her.
01:37:35 And then execute her.
01:37:36 Curve Stop.
01:37:40 Okay, next voicemail on that note.
01:37:43 Hell yeah.
01:37:44 Hell yeah, meaghtow for life.
01:37:46 This is fromrupt and it's coded as super important.
01:37:50 So let's see what that's about.
01:37:52 Do the flu, where the fuck are you?
01:37:56 The flu, do are you?
01:37:59 Please, the flu, where the fuck are you?
01:38:04 You are the fucking guy.
01:38:06 I don't fucking care about no one but Davoo.
01:38:09 What the fuck?
01:38:11 Uh, there's the voice of the people.
01:38:13 They clamor for Davoo.
01:38:14 Davoo messaged me on Discord a while ago.
01:38:17 And I was like, hey, wow, a message from Davoo.
01:38:19 Cool.
01:38:19 I should really read that and get back to him.
01:38:22 And then I forgot to do that.
01:38:24 So sorry, sorry, Davoo.
01:38:26 He sent us a secret friend's only video.
01:38:30 I won't even spill the beans.
01:38:31 Did you guys get sent this as well?
01:38:33 Wait, this was it.
01:38:34 And I forgot to actually watch it.
01:38:36 I responded with an exact quote,
01:38:37 hey, hey, hey, dope.
01:38:39 And I stand by it.
01:38:40 I stand by that message.
01:38:42 I won't even say what it is, but it is hilarious.
01:38:44 I'm a bad person.
01:38:46 Agreed.
01:38:47 Okay.
01:38:48 Yeah, yeah.
01:38:49 Davoo has just been, you know, offline for a while.
01:38:53 Yep.
01:38:54 But like, I don't know, he'll come back when he wants to.
01:38:56 I hope he's working on another game.
01:38:58 Yeah, me too.
01:38:59 Or I don't know, like preparing his.
01:39:00 Autominus was like a surprise hit.
01:39:02 Release Autonomous on Switch, Davoo.
01:39:04 Do it now.
01:39:05 Do it immediately.
01:39:07 I'd fucking buy Autonomous for Switch just to support him.
01:39:10 Autominus is fucking sick.
01:39:11 I mean, I'd play five bucks any day.
01:39:14 He's not going to get it on Switch.
01:39:15 What are you talking about?
01:39:16 Whatever.
01:39:16 Get it on Steam then.
01:39:17 They'll take anything.
01:39:18 They'll take whatever garbage they can.
01:39:20 He could, he could get it on Steam.
01:39:21 I thought it was funny as hell.
01:39:23 Well, I don't know what the process is like,
01:39:24 but it's good enough to be on Steam.
01:39:26 Absolutely.
01:39:26 Absolutely.
01:39:27 By a huge margin.
01:39:27 Yeah.
01:39:28 Okay.
01:39:28 Well, anyway, they'll take any old fucking shit visual novel.
01:39:32 That's true.
01:39:32 That's true.
01:39:34 All right.
01:39:34 Next one.
01:39:35 This is from A2Z.
01:39:37 Go.
01:39:39 Okay, Nate.
01:39:40 I know you're listening to this.
01:39:41 Yeah.
01:39:41 You don't have to put this on the show,
01:39:43 but please read the official one piece release on shonenjump.com
01:39:49 or vis slash shonenjump, whatever.
01:39:52 It's good quality, better quality than the scanlations.
01:39:57 That's enough.
01:39:58 Yeah, I know.
01:39:58 I got the gist.
01:39:59 Okay.
01:39:59 Cut that off, edit man.
01:40:01 He's just, this guy wrote in, and I appreciate that,
01:40:04 to just let me know that they release one piece chapters,
01:40:08 like weekly, relatively, on the actual Viz Media site.
01:40:12 After hearing this, I went and read it,
01:40:14 and it does look quite good.
01:40:16 The problem is, however, they take,
01:40:18 like the new chapter has been out for several days,
01:40:21 and they have not released it on the website yet.
01:40:24 So you'd be fucking hamstrung if you were depending on this
01:40:27 for doing like the pod decast or anything.
01:40:30 So, you know, I'd probably go and read it like later,
01:40:33 but not going to fucking do it up front.
01:40:35 But this is an advertisement for people
01:40:36 who want to read the highest quality releases of one piece.
01:40:39 We don't need to advertise that shit.
01:40:41 Give us the next one.
01:40:41 No?
01:40:41 Do you think everybody knows?
01:40:42 I just wanted to give everybody like notice,
01:40:44 because I wasn't even paying attention to this.
01:40:45 No, I just meant I don't want to give free advertising to Viz.
01:40:48 It's worth mentioning, I guess.
01:40:49 Do you not like Viz, or they're like a bad company or something?
01:40:51 No, I just don't, I don't know.
01:40:53 It's just, it's just, I was just joking.
01:40:56 All right.
01:40:57 Did she just want to give it away for free?
01:40:59 You gotta pay us.
01:41:00 They certainly, they say it should pay us.
01:41:02 You're right.
01:41:02 That's what I'm saying.
01:41:03 Okay, that's fair.
01:41:04 I hear you.
01:41:04 I hear you.
01:41:05 Viz, call me up.
01:41:07 I demand Viz, if you want us to sponsor your product,
01:41:10 you call in and leave an epic voicemail
01:41:12 that we could respond to on the episode.
01:41:15 Fill it with memes and whatnot.
01:41:17 Okay, moving on, whatever.
01:41:19 Next one from Harlock Asnable.
01:41:22 Fan favorite, go.
01:41:23 So you know how last time I was on here,
01:41:27 I was saying some stuff about Jesus and all that?
01:41:31 Yeah, it was all bullshit.
01:41:32 I lied.
01:41:33 I'm sorry, I had to.
01:41:35 But anyway, I can't really handle like real reality.
01:41:39 So I've been shopping around for like a new religion,
01:41:41 looked into Scientology, but it seems too expensive.
01:41:45 And they also had a similar anti-gay agenda,
01:41:47 just like a lot of the other ones.
01:41:49 So what are some like niche religions,
01:41:52 some like sweet like hidden gem religions?
01:41:56 What are your best recommendations?
01:41:58 What's your like artsy fartsy three by three of religions?
01:42:02 I need to know.
01:42:04 The Church of Spirit Science.
01:42:07 Spirit Science is like buddies with Satan, I think.
01:42:11 Seriously, Satan's like, you think it's the devil worship?
01:42:14 No, it's like the worship of yourself.
01:42:17 Yeah, but they put a really edgy label on it though.
01:42:19 Yeah, exactly.
01:42:20 You pissed off the Church people.
01:42:23 I think that's unironically, literally,
01:42:25 what the mindset behind Call of Duty was.
01:42:26 It totally was.
01:42:27 It was.
01:42:29 Listen, Satanism doesn't let you pilot the fucking love
01:42:33 battleship through the cosmos.
01:42:35 Yeah, that's true.
01:42:36 That's true.
01:42:38 Satan never fucking aligned my Kundalini.
01:42:42 Whoa.
01:42:43 Whoa, the Catholic priests were aligning my Kundalini,
01:42:46 my whole childhood, if you know what I'm saying.
01:42:49 Hell yeah, dude.
01:42:49 Hell yeah.
01:42:51 Wait, what?
01:42:52 Don't worry.
01:42:52 All right, next call.
01:42:53 This is from Schmeeblebop Dingle Dangle.
01:42:57 Go.
01:43:01 Hey, the BCP.
01:43:03 Hello.
01:43:03 That's my name.
01:43:04 I have one serious question I seriously need to ask you guys.
01:43:09 Okay.
01:43:10 Why the fuck is my PB hard?
01:43:16 Because you're listening to the pro-crastinators podcast,
01:43:19 giving you a boner every single time.
01:43:22 Yeah, there it is.
01:43:23 Okay, that's all.
01:43:25 Thanks for that.
01:43:26 Don't make promises you can't deliver though.
01:43:27 You left a really hard at that.
01:43:29 Oh, we've delivered.
01:43:31 All right, next one.
01:43:32 We have a boner guarantee.
01:43:34 If you're not satisfied with your boner,
01:43:36 and for at least four hours after five times.
01:43:37 We will come to your house and guarantee satisfaction personally.
01:43:44 Voice mail number seven.
01:43:45 We will RP with you on Discord, slide into our DMs,
01:43:49 and make a complaint.
01:43:51 You will achieve release, my dude.
01:43:53 You will.
01:43:56 I'm gonna throw up.
01:43:56 All right, number seven.
01:43:58 This is Cloud Strife calling in with another message.
01:44:00 What do you have for us?
01:44:03 Hello, it is me again, Cloud Strife.
01:44:07 No piano this time.
01:44:09 But Final Fantasy IX is out on the Nintendo Switch right now.
01:44:17 And I was wondering,
01:44:18 is it a good game?
01:44:20 I have seven, and it's the best one.
01:44:23 I've never finished nine.
01:44:25 It's the best thing ever,
01:44:26 but nine seems to have no Cloud Strife in it.
01:44:31 So when did that automatically make it like a piece of trash game?
01:44:35 As a matter of fact, in Lindblum,
01:44:39 in the town in Final Fantasy IX,
01:44:41 there is a weapon shop that on the wall has the Buster Sword
01:44:45 that Zidane goes up and he talks to it.
01:44:48 And it's just something like,
01:44:50 it's something like, oh, I bet some stormy guys
01:44:53 would sure enjoy using weapons like this.
01:44:57 It's something like that.
01:44:57 Roll my fucking eyes as hard as fucking possible.
01:45:00 That's not exactly how it sounds.
01:45:02 It's more clear or something,
01:45:04 but it's something like, wow,
01:45:05 who would be able to use a weapon this big or something like that?
01:45:08 But it is the Buster Sword.
01:45:10 Stormy guy.
01:45:11 I gotta look up the quote.
01:45:12 Okay, okay.
01:45:13 Anyway, so anyway, Final Fantasy IX is a masterpiece.
01:45:16 I got it for my switch,
01:45:17 and man, I just wanted to give my quick review of the hour I played.
01:45:22 Yep, that's bass as hell.
01:45:24 The fucking, they definitely use that mobile port version
01:45:27 or whatever, or the whatever steam version,
01:45:30 that like, oh my God, the models of your characters
01:45:32 and all the characters, they look good.
01:45:34 The background art is muddled and god-awful and it is such.
01:45:38 Oh, they didn't fix that?
01:45:39 No, they can't.
01:45:40 They've lost the original assets.
01:45:41 This is all they've got.
01:45:43 I will say that it's not so bad if you play it in windowed mode.
01:45:48 Great.
01:45:50 Great.
01:45:51 Yeah, like if you could just thrash the resolution, then yeah.
01:45:54 This is not the Buster Sword.
01:45:56 No?
01:45:56 Does it look similar?
01:45:57 But like, I can't find the show notes.
01:46:00 Not particularly.
01:46:01 Okay.
01:46:02 Link that, link that.
01:46:04 Let me look at it.
01:46:04 It's deaf.
01:46:05 People think, okay, maybe I was exaggerating a little bit.
01:46:09 Whatever, it's close enough.
01:46:10 Apparently he says something that is sort of a reference
01:46:13 to the size of Cloud's sword, but these are not Buster Sword.
01:46:15 Okay, you know what?
01:46:16 I was wrong, but there definitely was a reference there.
01:46:18 Okay, but whatever, doesn't matter.
01:46:20 Next voice mail.
01:46:21 Point is, it's a great game.
01:46:21 So go play it.
01:46:22 How many of these do you have?
01:46:23 Anyway, next voice mail.
01:46:25 This is from, I'm Being Dead Serious.
01:46:29 Begin.
01:46:30 Kingdom Hearts 3, Fur Fags, Pokemon Go, Babies, Pokemon Let's Go,
01:46:40 Actual Babies.
01:46:41 Now you guys need to get your fucking big boy pants on.
01:46:44 Go to the Google Play Store and download what Garfield Go.
01:46:47 I'm fucking serious.
01:46:48 Oh, you just got a French, Mr. Mine.
01:46:50 Guess what?
01:46:51 I was walking my dog yesterday and I found a fucking spicy Italian lasagna
01:46:55 under a fucking tree.
01:46:57 Oh, you just leveled up your Scyther into a scissor after grinding for months?
01:47:01 I just gave my cat a fucking doughnut and he leveled up.
01:47:04 Jesus Christ, get on my level.
01:47:06 Every day you're not playing Garfield Go is like a fucking Monday.
01:47:16 Fuck, man.
01:47:18 It's real though.
01:47:19 Garfield Go is a real game you can get.
01:47:21 No, it's not.
01:47:22 It is.
01:47:22 I looked it up ahead of time.
01:47:23 Shut the fuck up.
01:47:24 It's real.
01:47:25 We should all get it.
01:47:25 Shut your fucking mouth.
01:47:27 Go back to the fucking pizza party project with that fucking liar.
01:47:31 No, we should.
01:47:32 Next rad con.
01:47:33 We have to go play Garfield Go.
01:47:38 I just want to say I checked my shelf.
01:47:41 I do have Final Fantasy IX on the PlayStation 1, so I can see it.
01:47:45 Oh, you'll see it looking good.
01:47:46 But the thing is though, the problem is that they're using, I think,
01:47:49 the same visuals from the background of Final Fantasy IX,
01:47:52 but because resolution has improved so much,
01:47:55 they're able to render the models at a much higher resolution,
01:47:59 but the background art is pre-rendered art and stuff.
01:48:02 Oh yeah, yeah, I've seen that.
01:48:03 It's not even that the new version looks worse than the old game.
01:48:08 It's just weird and charring.
01:48:11 I just think it's bad.
01:48:12 They just don't look like they belong in the world.
01:48:14 I can bear it.
01:48:15 I can look past it.
01:48:16 But it is.
01:48:17 I got over it surprisingly quick.
01:48:18 I had been avoiding buying that remake for years because of that,
01:48:23 because the screenshots looked so fucking terrible,
01:48:25 but when I was actually playing it, I was not that bothered by it.
01:48:28 In the moment, from screen to screen, I can get over it,
01:48:30 but whenever I stop and concentrate, I'm like, oof, yikes.
01:48:33 I looked it up, and the line that Zidane says when he sees the sword is,
01:48:37 I knew it.
01:48:40 We used to call him Zidane, but it's actually Zidane.
01:48:42 It looks like whatever.
01:48:44 He says, I knew a spiky-haired guy that used a sword like this.
01:48:46 That's the one.
01:48:47 That's the one.
01:48:48 I appreciate that.
01:48:49 Stormy guy.
01:48:49 Whatever, close enough.
01:48:51 Okay, so Garfield Go, right?
01:48:53 For 602 reviews on the Google Play Store.
01:48:57 All five-star, I'm sure.
01:48:59 Its overall rating is 4.1.
01:49:01 Not bad.
01:49:03 Let me, okay, JB says, it's working now.
01:49:06 Get a kick out of Garfield pointing at the chests when you find them.
01:49:11 If I win Sutton, I'll get it a level.
01:49:14 I'll give it a five, no doubt.
01:49:17 Great.
01:49:17 Hold on.
01:49:18 Nate, how's that?
01:49:18 This golden voice feels as though we have left.
01:49:20 I got to piss with it.
01:49:21 We got two more after this.
01:49:22 Wait, one more from a Google, from a Google use, wait, two more.
01:49:27 Sebastian Foy says, I won a glazed donut from the 7-Eleven from the app.
01:49:32 When redeeming the prize, be aware that the redeem button does not instantly give you a coupon.
01:49:36 The redeem button sends you an email within three days,
01:49:37 then you confirm your name and alien address, then they send you the prize.
01:49:39 So you get real donuts out of this app.
01:49:41 You can win like food from 7-Eleven.
01:49:44 Holy shit.
01:49:45 Okay, a Google user says, came for the memes and stuck around when it was actually fun.
01:49:49 I didn't expect the prizes to actually be winnable,
01:49:52 but I have a dozen Rad Garfield stickers on display in my kitchen now.
01:49:56 Not bad.
01:49:57 Pokemon Go ain't got me shit for stickers or donuts.
01:49:59 One more, one more.
01:50:00 Dr. Robonto TV Productions Films gives it five out of five stars and says,
01:50:10 this game literally saved my life.
01:50:13 He was starving to death and he needed that glazed donut.
01:50:18 Garfield Go is the actual pinnacle of human achievement and should only be spoken if
01:50:23 positively if you're a fan of angelic experiences.
01:50:26 Download this masterpiece today.
01:50:28 He's memanous.
01:50:29 All right, that's pretty incredible.
01:50:32 Okay, all right.
01:50:33 Next.
01:50:34 Oh, sorry, sorry.
01:50:35 I've got it.
01:50:36 I've got it.
01:50:36 You downloaded it.
01:50:37 You got it.
01:50:37 We should all play.
01:50:38 We should all play.
01:50:39 Maybe it's Garfield Community Day today.
01:50:41 Oh, every, wait, I was going to say every Monday is community day, but it's like anti-community
01:50:44 day.
01:50:44 You like lose money if you log in on a Monday.
01:50:46 I want to announce that I did go out for swine of day and I did attain many delicious swine.
01:50:52 I didn't name any of them Brunswick.
01:50:53 Brunswick's dead, Nate.
01:50:54 Too obvious, too obvious.
01:50:54 You have to let go.
01:50:55 You have to let go.
01:50:56 He's gone.
01:50:57 Okay.
01:50:57 However, I do have the lucky Mamo swine that Munchie traded me when it was just a pillow swine.
01:51:03 And its name is Beef and Barley in his reference.
01:51:06 What's a shiny guy look like?
01:51:08 Is he is like blue?
01:51:09 It's kind of brownish green.
01:51:10 It's not good.
01:51:11 It's not a great shiny.
01:51:13 Okay.
01:51:13 Let's move on.
01:51:14 We got actually there was three more total.
01:51:16 This is prune man.
01:51:17 Prune man.
01:51:18 Hit us.
01:51:18 Go.
01:51:19 Hey Nathan slash Nathaniel.
01:51:21 I can't believe that the fucking supposed best guy ever doesn't even know that the optimal food to
01:51:27 make you poop is fucking prunes or prune juice even.
01:51:32 It fucking gets that shit flowing right the fuck out and you're fucking sitting in the hospital
01:51:37 paying fucking.
01:51:38 I don't know.
01:51:39 You don't even need to just so you can feel like oh I'm safe.
01:51:44 I'm protected.
01:51:45 Meanwhile, there's a perfect home remedy that's been there your whole life if not longer
01:51:50 and prunes are even fucking good.
01:51:52 They taste good.
01:51:53 So just eat them.
01:51:55 God damn it.
01:51:57 I took I took actual laxatives and it wasn't doing shit.
01:52:00 So I have never eaten a prune in my entire life.
01:52:03 I've had some prunes.
01:52:04 I like them.
01:52:05 They're good.
01:52:05 I think they're actually quite tasty.
01:52:07 Prunes are nice.
01:52:08 I like them too.
01:52:09 I'm curious about them.
01:52:10 I get a jar of dried prunes.
01:52:12 They're kind of like apricots.
01:52:13 They're real good.
01:52:14 Sadly, they're not keto.
01:52:16 Oh well.
01:52:18 Tell them.
01:52:18 Yeah.
01:52:19 Fucked.
01:52:19 There's some nice what's that?
01:52:21 What's that?
01:52:21 You know those people who makes the raisins with the lady with like the sunburst behind her?
01:52:25 You know what I'm talking about?
01:52:26 Oh yeah.
01:52:27 Sunburst.
01:52:27 No, minute made.
01:52:28 No, minute made.
01:52:30 Minute made.
01:52:31 Okay, whatever it was they make like a big like cardboard tub of dried prunes and I would
01:52:36 fucking snack on those all day.
01:52:38 Mom used to get them.
01:52:38 They were delicious as hell.
01:52:39 Recommended.
01:52:40 Recommended.
01:52:41 Okay, but anyway, I should fucking just go buy some of those right now.
01:52:43 Okay, next mail.
01:52:45 Two more.
01:52:45 This is from coolmichill.
01:52:48 Commence.
01:52:49 Sunmate.
01:52:49 It's sunmate raisin.
01:52:50 Sunmate, okay.
01:52:52 Hey members of the PCP.
01:52:53 I was just wondering how do all of you relax?
01:52:56 Now this is largely geared towards like hippo or digi or nate.
01:53:00 People who do review channels because I've noticed recently that even though I enjoy video games,
01:53:07 I've started being hypercritical of them and trying to unpack them, etc.
01:53:11 Figure out why I feel the way I do towards all of them.
01:53:14 Take an analytical mindset.
01:53:16 And this has led to me being just stressed all the time because I no longer have an outlet
01:53:21 to just wind down what I want to.
01:53:23 That's even if you play a good game.
01:53:25 I guess you're saying he's turned on his analysis meter so high that it's given him
01:53:30 the shakes and the shimmies.
01:53:31 This is a place where it's difficult for me to relate to a lot of people because I
01:53:35 I hear people say things like that or that they they're stressed out by like negativity.
01:53:40 And I get like people tell me all the time like that they wish I would have like less
01:53:44 negative takes on things.
01:53:46 I don't find like to me it's fun to be negative to be analytical.
01:53:53 Like it's just my natural state.
01:53:55 It doesn't make me necessarily like I mean granted.
01:53:59 There's lots of shows that like or games that I will just stop playing very quickly
01:54:03 because they are you know because I'm analyzing and I think it's bad and I don't want to play
01:54:08 it anymore.
01:54:08 But like I don't I don't find the state of I guess because I don't force myself to
01:54:15 continue playing those things if they're bad.
01:54:17 Like I will just switch to something else.
01:54:18 And to me the fun is in constantly burning through as many things as possible looking
01:54:23 for something good and then you know getting to experience something really great because
01:54:28 I didn't stop myself to you know play every fucking bad game or watch every bad show.
01:54:34 Instead I just burned through all those until I found something truly amazing.
01:54:38 And then yeah if you want to relax you just play the amazing game.
01:54:41 I mean I'm sure Hippo could talk about playing Dark Souls over and over and over again.
01:54:45 That was like yeah that's like me getting Final Fantasy 9 just because like I know it's great
01:54:49 and I don't really have to think about much and just kind of nice just relax and you know
01:54:53 play through it.
01:54:55 This is a thing that I've kind of thought about a bit at some points like why how analysis as
01:55:02 like a thing has like changed my views a little bit.
01:55:06 Most obviously to me is like the way that I used to read One Piece where I wouldn't I
01:55:11 didn't think anything could be bad about One Piece because I just enjoyed it the whole time.
01:55:15 And then I met Nate and he talked about One Piece and he's you know he introduced me to
01:55:21 being angry at it all the time and I was like I know it's but it's like you have criticisms
01:55:30 and I never used to have them and now that I read One Piece there was a bit of a time when I was
01:55:36 like what worrying like oh am I gonna be a nitpicky bitch not even that you are that but
01:55:42 like I was wondering about it and I found that it's it's really just I don't care like like you
01:55:49 can make yourself not care about things you can make yourself just be cool with anything yeah
01:55:53 you know what I think like the the reason I liked analysis in the first place was just to
01:55:59 understand why I like what I like so that I can explain it to people it's not necessarily about
01:56:05 like tearing things down for the sake of it if you if you like analysis because you watch a lot
01:56:09 of YouTube that does that and now you do it yourself um I guess just think about like why
01:56:17 like do you do you want to be like the youtubers you're watching or is it something like do you
01:56:23 actually want to do it yourself I think that a big part of the entertainment value of media for me
01:56:28 is getting to have an opinion on it like that is what I'm like coming to it for is like I'm gonna
01:56:35 watch this and I'm gonna have an opinion and it's gonna be great you know and then like if it's bad
01:56:41 I can go aw man I can explain why this is bad that's gonna be a lot of fun or if it's great
01:56:46 oh I can't wait to brag about how great this show is and tell everybody to go watch it it's like
01:56:51 I can't lie that now that I do YouTube stuff when I see something and I like have something I think
01:56:55 is really interesting to say that's very exciting that I'm gonna get to share like with people and
01:56:59 I'm like hell yes and that's why it frustrates me when there are people who are like oh I you know
01:57:05 I find your your negativity depressing or something I'm like you if you're finding it depressing
01:57:11 you shouldn't be watching these videos because I'm finding it fun I'm doing this because it's
01:57:15 exciting and it's it's like I get to look at something and I get to explain why I feel a
01:57:22 way about a thing and that's always fun it doesn't matter if it's negative or positive feelings
01:57:26 you know and you know I I just realized I didn't really answer his question like how to relax
01:57:31 none of us have it's um I I mean I there was a time when I was like I wouldn't play a game
01:57:40 unless I wanted to make a video on it or unless I thought I could make a video on it now I don't
01:57:44 really do the video stuff anymore so it's easier to just pick up something and play it for for fun
01:57:50 um but before that I would relax by just I don't know I don't think I relax something else honestly
01:57:58 well see that's why I'm praying rapidly that I honestly think same dog same thing I was gonna
01:58:04 say at first like I totally am with you digi on like it's just fun for me to like experience
01:58:09 things and have opinions like good or bad or whatever and like just that part of the analyzing
01:58:13 process is really enjoyable to me but what I like I kind of feel like it's like a larger issue
01:58:18 like what this reminds me of is like like Sam Harris talks a lot about like the the like mental
01:58:24 strain put on us just by being interacting with like social media in general and like what I think
01:58:29 this is maybe cost of like it's like that shonen trope of like we're activating our like our latent
01:58:34 potential but at the cost of our lifespan we're eating away at it to achieve extra 10 000 super
01:58:39 points and like I like I feel like there's probably like a larger strain on like my mind day to day
01:58:46 since I'm like trying to be critical about stuff that used to be you know pretty pretty non-critical
01:58:52 of though I mean I don't know I've always been relatively critical yeah I don't I don't remember
01:58:56 a time when I wasn't like this is the thing for me it's like I just wonder if maybe for both you
01:59:00 and me and everybody it'd be helpful to like like what some people do like uh like a week out of the
01:59:06 year or like a month with like no social media and like it's it's to force yourself even if that's
01:59:11 your normal state of mind to like de-stress your brain or something and then maybe there'll be a
01:59:16 time I mean definitely so I don't think he's really talking about social media though that's stressful
01:59:20 for totally different reasons yeah they're different I just kind of mean like the like social media is
01:59:26 like uh well yeah okay there social media is all bad and bad sure fair enough fair enough
01:59:33 so I mean I guess I just say yeah I've always wanted to try I've never done this but like
01:59:38 taking time off from like pretty much like like a real vacation of like putting down the phone
01:59:44 not like going out of your way to like keep up with you know whatever like if you're a review guy
01:59:50 because like that's the context you said oh you know what I realized I'm wrong I have an answer
01:59:54 to this question it's smoke weed obviously that's how I that's the number one because you reminded me
02:00:00 because I went on sort of a vacation for Christmas um you know I went to May's house for the holidays
02:00:06 and I was just like I showed up with the like in my mind I was like I'm not going to plan
02:00:12 anything there's no stress all the videos I needed to come out are out I'm not worried about work
02:00:17 I'm not worried about getting home I'm not worried about anything going on I'm just gonna sit on this
02:00:21 couch smoke well you know vape a bunch of weed and watch Christmas specials and uh and I ended up
02:00:28 the funny thing about it is that even in that mind state I tend to be even more creative and like
02:00:35 have more answers of what I would want to make it maybe it's maybe it's like that fucking spike
02:00:39 spiegel mindset of like when you relax like that's when you can be the most lethal or whatever when
02:00:45 you're not putting the stress you can flow like water yeah when you I mean when you try to force
02:00:49 yourself to to have ideas then you're constantly yeah you stress yourself out over not having them
02:00:55 and then when they just naturally come to you it's like you're way more excited about them
02:00:59 because it feels like it just sprung out of pure inspiration you know yeah which is a way better
02:01:04 feeling than you know analyzing the SEO optimization and whatnot uh yeah yeah maybe I don't I'm trying
02:01:12 to think because like I don't feel like I've had that many stress moments where I'm like I need to
02:01:18 relax I think I'm just normally chill and then like it doesn't take much to get me feeling okay
02:01:24 like I just go outside and I feel all right well let me I'm I'll give this guy like some
02:01:30 some advice since he since he specifically mentioned like being a youtube's man or whatever
02:01:34 whatever your project is what I'd say is it's important to have dedicated downtime which I
02:01:40 don't have but I should yes like so if you work five days a week you should maybe one day a week
02:01:46 I don't even want to do this but like to those who want to like optimize their living situation
02:01:51 literally force yourself to do no work maybe for like I don't know a weekend that's every weekend
02:01:58 that's a part of why I love going out to eat because it's like I can just put everything aside
02:02:02 and be like I'm going out on this venture to go get food and enjoy myself and nothing no other
02:02:08 thoughts need to enter my brain in this time you know yeah but like like for me dated like every
02:02:13 day it's taken me a while to get my upload schedule back to it and you know people are waiting for
02:02:17 the next we are going whatnot so like it's on my mind all the time as soon as a video comes out
02:02:22 there's like a few seconds of peace and then I'm thinking it's time to think about the next one
02:02:27 immediately and that's just the nature of the beast and that's that's the nature of youtube being
02:02:32 like so much work for so much relatively low pay you know yeah unless you're one of the people
02:02:37 just getting used to to getting used to doing all that work yep it's not for everybody it's not
02:02:43 possibly not for the vast vast majority including me I think it's unhealthy for everyone yeah I mean
02:02:48 I'm not a full-time youtuber maybe it will not work well with my psychology we'll find out one of
02:02:53 these days um so yeah I don't know just give yourself breaks really and try to turn off the
02:02:58 youtube stuff no matter what I don't know that's that's my thought uh and we've got this fucking
02:03:03 garfield game is still loading I don't know whether it's ever gonna load do we have more of these
02:03:08 these bad boys uh we've got one final voicemail to listen to and this one boy let me just okay
02:03:16 let me just preface this this is actually a series of four voicemails that were sent in
02:03:20 called sex with the young part one through four basically um and I'm sparing you the first three
02:03:28 because they are not necessary and I'm just gonna show off the last one can you can you
02:03:33 yeah let me I'll give you the it's just it starts out sex with the young part one
02:03:37 is uh Vic Miniana calling in to let us know oh excellent you know he's very excited to be
02:03:42 wait who's Vic Miniana you know uh current current voice actor dealing with some allegations
02:03:48 right now unproven but you know he's definitely true though and um uh by the way it was very funny
02:03:56 to watch like yesterday during your stream you're just like he's a rapist no one's accused him of
02:04:01 rape he's a rapist no one is even acute and may is like did you we probably shouldn't like sling
02:04:07 like accusations I said I said I am hey I'm just a parody character I have no indeed none of this
02:04:14 is liable in any way right but I know what I believe fair enough fair enough um notable
02:04:21 notable unconvicted monster slip through the legal cracks as it were um by not committing the crime
02:04:30 in quotations I have no idea what the what the beef with Vic Miniana is right now but it doesn't
02:04:37 matter I mean the beef should be that he has the most annoying voice of all time well you'll
02:04:42 like how I smell number two otherwise watchable dubs Edward Elric called in in part two to let
02:04:47 us know that he has a terrible voice and that he I want to save Al so you know that not really
02:04:53 relevant to sex with a young but whatever um number three was Donatello calling in to let us know
02:04:59 that he is picking up the mantle of sex with the young and he's running with that um and now here
02:05:04 we are the final chapter by the way if you if people have a link to the SoundCloud you can go
02:05:08 listen to these I don't know if they like have a link to it I put them all up there but in any case
02:05:13 here's the final chapter of sex with the young finale go also hashtag kick vic and fucking punch
02:05:22 Todd purely because of their terrible squealy annoying high-pitched day boy sissy boy pussy boy
02:05:35 fuck boy femi ass queer ass shitty voices seriously not any of their sexual misconduct
02:05:45 no god forbid I mean but the fact that the anime dubbing industry let their performances continue
02:05:55 on for the amount of time that they did is actually despicable and you should oh be fucking ashamed
02:06:03 of yourselves hard agree seriously why can't we get more like baritone range skinny anime dudes
02:06:12 like steve bloom a spike spiegel come on i'm right here donatello why are they knocking on
02:06:19 the whole donatello door why are they booking telling me to play spike in the live action
02:06:26 Netflix come on I my father forced me to be a ninja but all I've ever wanted to be was an actor
02:06:37 and I've never once gotten the role this is it this is why I must go to soccer icon and

02:07:00 there guys uh the soccer icon near you that's right Vic is in the soccer icon he's the voice yeah he
02:07:07 is the voiceover he's uh he's the staple he's I think he like arranged the whole thing I could
02:07:12 be wrong about that but uh I know he's wait is he in the legendary soccer icon yeah at the end
02:07:16 he's the voice at the end that's like you should go to soccer icon whoa I had no idea I had no idea
